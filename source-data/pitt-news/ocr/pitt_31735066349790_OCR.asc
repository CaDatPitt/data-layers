BY BILL MOORE

You wouldn't know by looking
at it now, but Pitt’s Student Union
was once P_ittsburgh’s ﬁnest hotel.

Everyone who was anyone
stayed at the Hotel Schenley at the
turn of the century. Lillian Russell
was marriedthere, more than a few
presidents slept there and the

moneyed of Pittsburgh celebrated
there in the then-ornate ballroom.

Its proximity to the recently
leveled Forbes Field made it the
Pittsburgh home for Casey Stengel,
Babe Ruth and the rest. Its
proximity to Carnegie Hall made it
home for actors, actresses, musici-
ans and poets.

It was one of the few places that
could honestly be called “Grand.”

 marble and sophistication that characterized Schenley Hotel is
missing from a remodeled Student Union.

GRANDPARENTS HAVE
RIGHTS TOO

HARRISBURG (AP)—Grand-
parents would have the right to
visit their grandchildren regardless
of the marital status‘ of the

‘children’s parents under a bill

passed yesterday by the House.

The visitation rights would also
apply regardless of the relationship
between the grandparents and the
person ‘having custody of the
‘children.

The ballroom, scene of festive
occasion upon festive occasion for
the exclusive crowd, was ornately
mirrored with chandeleirs, silver
candelabras and waltzing Violon-
ists. Today, the mirrors remain,
but the gold and silver, and the
exquisiteness, have been removed.

The dining room was once the
only place in Pittsburgh to get fresh
caviar. It was famous, too, for it’s
house special—“‘Schenley Souf-
ﬂe.” Now it houses small lectures,
meager exhibits and pinochle

games.

And the roo_ms. The rooms that
housed the greats and near-greats.

The rooms are now painted‘
_ institutional green, are marred by

20 years of student abuse and have
probably forgotten the stories they
had to tell. L

Pitt acquired what is now known
as Schenley Hall in 1956 for. $1.8
million. Pitt was doing the hotel
owners a bit of a favor by buying it,
some say, because business was
declining. It was declining,
however, because of Pitt. As the
campus grew larger and uglier,
people felt less like wading through
the students and traffic to sample a
Schenley Souffle. When the hotel
closed it’s doors in the summer of

   
   
  
   
  
   
    
   
 
 
 
 
 
    
 
  
 
   
   
  
 
   
  
   
  
  
  

'56, it marked an end of an era for
Oakland. The signs still _say—‘
“Oakland, The Cultural Center of
Pittsburgh”—but a quick glance at
the endless concrete tells you

differently.
Schenley -Hall still offers quite a

bit. Everything, it seems, but
beauty or class. The 11-story
structure houses almost all student
organizations, from the big ofﬁces
of Student Government and The
Pitt News, to the shared quarters of
the -Unicycle, Ski and Glee Clubs.

It houses the ofﬁces of Student

other student services. It houses’
an employment office, the Finan-
cial Aid ofﬁces and way up on top,
the Math Department.

BY CONNIE GIEL

The Student Health Service
may not be important to freshmen
during Orientation, but by winter
term’s flu season, the place may
become a second home.

V Last month a $16-per-term
health fee for all full-time students
was approved by the Board of

V V Trustees.

All undergraduates and gradu-
ates on the Oakland campus will be.

p assessed the fee this fall.

In years past, students could
purchase a modified or full
insurance plan, or use their
parents’ program.

A fee-for-services-rendered pl-

an, which netted the Health
Service $180,000 yearly, also was
offered.

DR. JOANNE ROBINSON

  Student Health Service
For What Ails You

But the resulting Health Ser-
vice’s funding base was insufficient
and, though those options will be
retained as supplements, the fee
has been implemented to take up
the financial slack.

The fee will generate an
estimated $500,000 yearly. The
University will provide $200,000 in
the fall to balance the Health
Service's budget.

Part-time students may purchase
the insurance premiums or pay the
fee. A modiﬁed insurance plan is

.being negotiated.

In spring and summer session,
the fee will be $8, effective next
year.

Services of physicians and
nurses, including a general practi-
cioner, a gynecologist, a dermatol-
ogist and an internist, will be
covered by the fee.

Mental health care, family
planning, allergy injections, lab
and X-ray tests and counseling also
will be covered.

A proposed health education
program with nutrition, first aid
and sexuality clinics may be
worked out and implemented by
the fall term.

The fee will appear on fall term
invoices, which will be mailed in
the next few weeks. A Student
Health consumer board, comprised
of students, is preparing an
explanatory brochure to be mailed
under separate cover to incoming
students.

The Health Service is located in
Brackenridge Hall, in the quadran-
gle dormitory complex. Its director
is Dr. Joanne Robinson, who will
be available during Orientation to
answer questions about the service
and the fee.

 Freshman Fall Camp

   Slated For September  

 

 

 

W

BY MARGY STEIN

' It's not easy to be a freshman.
Havoc begins the day after high
school graduation, and picks up
momentum as September ap-
proaches. To help prepare for that
big day in fall, orientation lets
students get the gist of campus life.

The three days of orientation are
furiously ﬁlled with meetings with
the Chancellor, meetings with the
vice chancellors and meetings with
other freshmen. By the end of the
day, all the names blend into one
and it's necessary to think twice to
remember your own.

Campus life also means an
endless number of facts: class
schedules, professors’ names,
room numbers, and important
do-or-die dates such as invoice

yments and class regi

tion should be typewritten and

deadlines and the year’s ﬁrst
fraternity party. It also can mean
to learn to plant your feet ﬁrmly,
and...wait. There are lines for
registrations, bill payments, din-
ner, even for the bathrooms.

But once you're physically and
mentally acclimated to the campus,
life at the university is as unique as
it is fun. An easy way to lighten the
burden of transition is to make
friends, peers who are going
through the same things youare,
and others who have been through
it one to three years previously.

One place to meet those friends
is at Freshman Fall Camp '76. The
camp, to be held at Camp
Kon-O-Kwee, Fombell, Pa., is
organized for the freshman by
upperclassmen who remember all
too well what those first couple of
days and weeks were like.

This three-day excursion into the
backwoods will provide a rustic
setting for all types of sports
activities including swimming,
volleyball, canoeing, softball and
frisbee-ing.

The camp will be held the ﬁrst
weekend of school, September
10-12, and the price will be $18
which includes room, board and
round trip bus ride.

That weekend, Pitt Pantherfans,
is the Pitt vs. Notre Dame away

football game. and the game will be

 

televised ‘at the camp.

Hugs and Kisses, Pitt Frosh

BY BILL MOORE

I met my mentor once. He was
an affable fellow, handsome, lots of
teeth. His name was Rege
Kaufman, a former Student Gov-
ernment president.

As a mentor he was worthless.
Most are.

As I recall, the only mentor
meeting I sat in on during my
orientation was sparsely attended.

No’ one was that eager to meet E

"Rege and hear funny Pitt jokes.

BEHIND THE LINES

The idea of mentors is strange
for a university like Pitt, as are the
references to the meetings in the
orientation schedule. Mentors,
presumably, are wise and faithful
counselors, like Ulysses’ mythical
tutor. Some may be.

But what most are is. aptly
explained by a quick glance at the
mentor meeting promos in the
Orientation schedule.

—Monday, 5:45 p.m. - 7 p.m.
MENTOR MEETING. Back by
popular demand...THE ‘MEN-
TORS. Now better than ever! You
can’t attend just one!

—Tuesday, 6 p.m. - .7:15 p.m.
MENTOR MEETING. Still dis-

oriented? Oh, uh, you say
oriented?!...Well, whatever the
case...your Mentor is waiting for
you!

Wednesday, 10 a.m. - 12 noon.
“[W]RAP IT ALL UP”. Gotta
gripe? Gotta compliment? Or just

don’t know what to do? Come
“Shoot the breeze” with Sue,
Marcia and the Mentors. We’ve

got the answers, if you have the
questions.

And lastly:

—Wednesday, 1 p.m. - 2 P-11‘-
MENTOR MEETING. You
wouldn’t dare leave without saying

saying goodbye????

goodbye to ' your Mentor, would
you? Make plans for September!!

It sounds a bit like the mentors
are speaking to ﬁrst-year grade
school, not college, students. And
especially not a college like Pitt,
which prides itself on offering
college students a taste of the real
world, not the country club
atmosphere of many smaller, more
expensive colleges. I

A freshman entering Pitt should
be, and probably ‘is’, too mature to
take delight ‘ in “shooting the
breeze” with Sue and Marcia,
whoever they are. They may want
to talk to someone, but not “rap."
Similarly, many freshmen can and
will attend just one mentor
meeting, if any, and most will
probably take great delight in

meeting of the mentoould you leave these folks without

Moore photo

leaving without saving goodbye to
their mentors. Their only plans for
September will be to avoid their
mentor. V College students, and
even seniors in high school, are
past the age where they get excited
by “in” words and generous
sprinklings oflllllllll

It’s degrading to the freshmen to
assume otherwise.

The ’ orientation schedule to
which I refer ends with an italicized
note—-PARTING IS SUCH SWEET
SORROW-SEE YOU IN SEP-
TEMBER! HUGS AND KISSES,
The 1976 Orientation Staff.

If my mentor had tried to hug or
kiss me, he would have lost his
moustache. As for seeing me in
September—he didn’t. .

How To Make EndsMeet

BY MARK CELENDER

Many freshmen entering college

this year may ﬁnd it almost
impossible to make financial ends
meet.
, Estimated academic expenses
for undergraduate students during
1975-76 totaled $3,400 for a
Pennsylvania resident living in a
dorm or apartment, $2,439 for
commuters and $4,640 for out-of-
state residents.

These total figures include
tuition fees, room and board,
medical insurance, books, trans-
portation and other expenses like
tranquilizers.

The expenses of college take
quite a bit out of many family
purses but if you and your family
find it impossible to afford a
college, then you‘may be eligible
for some type of financial help.

According to Charles R. Dees,
associate dean of Student Aid,
about 60% of the _students
attending Pitt are receiving some
type of financial aid. The Ofﬁce of
Student Aid, located on the sixth
floor of the Student Union, is
responsible for coordinating all
student aid programs for under-
graduate.

For a freshmen student to be
considered for ﬁnancial aid, a
Parent's Conﬁdential Statement
should have been submitted to the
College Scholarship Service by
Feb. 1, for the fall term and Nov. 1,
for the winter term. It's too late

now to register for the fall term but
there is plenty of time to submit a
form to the College Scholarship
Service for the Winter term. The

Parent's Conﬁdential Statement
may be obtained at the aid office.
There are numerous scholarships
available to students ranging from
the Chancellor's merit scholarships
to awards given by private
foundations and clubs. There are
also federal, state and local grants
available to those students who are

Dean Marshall

BY MAGGIE McKAY

A smattering of “Hi, Bob’s”
greet Robert Marshall as he enters
his freshmen studies class. Taking
off his jacket, he sits down at a desk
and chats with the students for a
few minutes before starting his
lecture.

Marshall, Dean of the College of
Arts and Sciences (CAS) at Pitt, is a
tall, soft-spoken man who shuns
formality and denies any claims of
bureaucratic authority.‘ He de-
scribes himself as a ﬁrm believer in
the liberal arts experience.
Although hisjduties as CAS dean
take up much of his time, he makes
a point of teaching at least one

 class, usually a freshman studies

\

class, per semester.

As CAS dean, Marshall is,
perhaps, the ultimate authority
when it comes to interpreting and

enforcing the rules and regulations A

of the College.

“In many ways, the position of
dean is not really a very powerful
one,” Marshall said. “I’m the
court of last appeal. I’m the one
you come to if you need an
exception to the rules. I also have
the power of advocacy. I’m a clean
and I guess I have a podium to
operate from.” =
' Marshall prefers to think of his
ofﬁce as a “home” for students.
Students stream in and out of his
ninth ﬂoor Cathedral office asking
for permission to drop a class or
trying to have a grade changed.

The dean's office is modest, not
imposing as one might expect it to
be. A battered briefcase rests on
top of the piles of books and papers
scattered over_ Marshall’s instituti-

onal-gray steel desk. A few
cabinets, an armchair and a couch
fill the rest of the room. The phone
rings constantly. A student can
walk into Marshall’s office and
make an appointment anytime. “If
I'm not busy, he can talk to me
immediately,” Marshall said.

“My goal is to help students,”
Marshall said. “I can honestly say
that when a student comes to see
me I start with the hope of helping
him. It would be easy to start out at
the other end of the spectrum
saying, ‘Prove it.’ ”

‘‘I don’t get bored with my job,
not at all,” Marshall said. “My
desire is to say yes to everybody
but when I say no I try never to give
just a ﬂat no.”

He said he often considers a
student’s petition for an exception
to the rules in light of the imagined

  ‘I ’m The One You Come To’ 

reactions of the rest of the student
body.

“I think, ‘If I were to publicize
this exception would I get
thousands of responses?’ If I
would, then I would be involved in
inequity in granting just one,”
Marshall said.

When considering a student’s
pleas, Marshall tries to be faithful
to the spirit as well as the letter of
CAS regulations.

“In the last analysis, I have to be
trueto the faculty, for the rules and
regulations were made by them.
And I have to act equitably towards
the student,” he said.

Marshall came to Pitt in 1964
from the University of Wisconsin’s
school of graduate studies, where
he obtained a Ph.D. in English
Literature. He became dean of
CAS=in 1973.

I enemy!”
_ -forearmed!” are as true for school
‘ as they are for combat.

BY BOB PELLEGRINI

School, for me, has been one
long, nasty‘ war. Each of the
fourteen years I’ve been in school
has been a campaign; each course
becomes a sector of that campaign.

Major test and term papers are
equivalent to major offensives.
Quizzes are minor skirmishes. (A
course graded primarily on quizzes
then becomes a guerilla war.)
In-class discussions are much like
the World War I practice of
shouting obscenities across No-
Man’s land; it helps let the enemy

-(the course instructor) know you

are alive and kicking.

' In all wars, intelligence is vitally
important. What are the enemy’s
weak spots? Where is he
strongest? Can you expect any
tricks? the maxims “Know thy
and . “Forewamed is

Every student, on one occasion
or another, tries to get information

about a course or an instructor.

The usual method for this is to ask

‘  RNEWISF-llrlonday, une.'2l  6

Gearing Up For Registration Battle

a person who has taken the course:
“Is it tough? What kind of test
does the teacher give? How does
he grade?”

To the experienced and battle-
hardened veteran of the academic
wars, this method might seem
crude—but effective. It is a basis
to the more advanced methods of
ﬁnding‘ out how to choose and
perform in a course.

To show the beleaguered student
how to ﬁnd good courses, and avoid
bad ones, I’d like to first show how
to not take a course; then, show how
to obtain information on courses
and teachers and how to use it to
best advantage; and, finally, give
an example of the right way of
doing Academic Intelligence work.

On the first day of my freshman
year, as I sat sweating in a cramped
classroom along with 50 other
people, I had no idea what the
course I was taking in that room
was about. I faintly remembered
that it was Early American History
or something; and that it was listed
as History- on my schedule.

In walked a tall, stooped man
carrying a briefcase, wearing a
dirty sports coat, a string tie with a
cowboy hat clasp and construction
boots. His head seemed to be a

ball of hair with clearings in the

growth for two eyes (I think), a
nose and an incredibly small
mouth. To my dismay and

wonderment, I found in one short ,

second that it could actually
speak...and that it was the
instructor of the course.

“Mah name is Professor — —.
All Ah wan ta say is that histry
nevah learnt nobody nutt’in.” He
then opened his briefcase, pulled
out a , stack of typed papers
(probably his masters thesis

written ages ago) and started’ to‘

read; never pausing to recognize
the sea of hands that would pop up
from time to time. As a matter of
fact, the whole course was him
mumbling from those pages for an

 Eb»:
iﬁittﬁrms

entire term, never asking questions
or answering them. The course
was not American History, as I had
believed, but the “History of Early
American Philosophy.”

After that ﬁrsthour, if 1 had been
more experienced, I would have

joined most of the class in racing to

G-17, the registration office, with a
drop slip in hand. Only 24 people
‘remained at the end of the course.
One-half of the class got lower than
a C for their ﬁnal grades.

I survived that course (barely). I
was determined, however, never to
walk into a course without having
some idea of what to expect from
the course or the teacher. There
had to be a better way of doing
things.

I soon learned that picking good
courses is a fairly easy process and

that there are many ways to go _

about it. The easiest, is simply to
ask everybody who might know.
Ask a friend if he has taken any
good courses that term and, if so,
why he liked them. Ask teachers.
If you are presently taking an
English Writing course and plan to
take an English Writing course the
next term, ask your present teacher
if she could recommend a course.
Finally, and of much importance,
ask your advisor.

Your advisor is probably the only
non-teacher type person to whom
you aren’t just a number on a
computer printout. He knows your
problems; He has your academic
suggest what courses would
interestyou and which would_n"t tax
your mental resources to an
inordinate degree. As well as
telling you what the -requirements
are for graduation and attaining
majors, he can lend an understand-
ing and sympathetic ear when you
tell of how tough it is out there and
how teachers. don’t,recognize your
fine abilities. He’s almost as good
as a bartender in that-"respect.

When you are finished with oral
dectective work, it-is time to begin
in-depth research.

Obtain a copy of the University’s
equivalent to The Racing Form: the
Course Description Booklet. This
booklet, widely distributed around
campus, will show what courses are
being offered, what the require-
ments of the courses are, the
number of test or papers given
during the course and the name of
the instructor. Remember at all
times, that this is the “Enemy”
advertising its own product;
courses might sound better than
they, in fact, are.

Next, get your hands on a copy of
the Undergraduate Review.
Formerly published once a year in
late November, it was a compila-
tion of courses that were evaluated
by students in the Fall term.

Courses were evaluated on
content, degree of difficulty, the
grading system and the effective-
ness of the teacher.

The trouble with the Undergrad-
uate Review is that some teachers
—many of them wisely—refuse to
allow their courses to be evaluated;
or, if evaluated, they refuse to
allow bad evaluations to be
published. It should be noted that
many excellent teachers will not
allow evaluation; but the truth is
the Undergraduate Review has
become a “de facto” list of popular
courses offered by the University.

Due to lack of funding, the
review is no longer being publish-
ed, _but old copies are available
from the ground ﬂoor reference
desk in Hillman Llbrary.

Remember, not all courses listed
in _« the Review as “Excellent”

would appeal to you; and a very
large number of truly excellent
courses are not listed.

Now we come to the more
advanced and devious method ‘of
examining a course. Every student

should know exactly how an
instructor grades a course. To
accomplish this, all the student
need do is to go to the department
from which the course is offered.

Plastered all over walls, desks,
doorways, ﬁre extinguishers and
hapless students who happened to
stand still too long at the end of the
term are the grades of students in
courses presently given and cour-
ses given epochs ago by that
department. Teachers never seem
to take them down.

Since these lists are posted in
no special order, it takes a long
time to ﬁnd the right list but it is
well worth it. This method makes it
possible to see how many A’s, B’s,
and so on, the teacher gave. If you
see a lot of A’s on the list you might
want to take the course. This
doesn’t mean it is a good .course,
just one in which a lot of A’s were
given.

Take care to make sure you’ve
found the right section of the
course; many courses have two or
three sections. Also make sure the
same instructor is teaching the
course: Atilla the Hun might have
started teaching it after the list was

4 posted.

When you are ﬁnished looking at
the grades posted in the depart-
mental areas, look around the
departments for stacks and boxes
of old ﬁnal exams or ﬁnal papers.
There are literally ‘hundreds of
unclaimed papers there from past
semesters and it is not unusual to
ﬁnd papers entitled: “Will Presi-
dent Eisenhower Recognize Red
China?” ,

Look through old papers and
tests and see what kind of grades
the teachers gave -out and what
kind of questions they asked.
Personally, doing this made me
feel like a grave-robber, but, after a
while, the feeling passed.

Keep in mind that the usual
punishment for spies—and grave-
robbers———is death. Some teachers
having been students themselves,
do not put their classes’ papers out
in the departmental area.

Remember, choose your own
ground! Never do a paper on a
subject that the instructor is
familiar with. To ﬁnd out what
exactly he is familiar with requires
abit of research.

If the instructor has written
anything, and has had it published,
make sure you get acquainted with
it. The way the person writes will
tell you a lot about the man’s
personality even before you set
eyes on him and also tell you what
to expect in the course. Hillman
Library seems to make a special
effort to stock books and articles
written by members of the faculty.
Also, if the instructor has earned
his masters or doctorate at Pitt,
his dissertation will be shelved on
the second floor.

Finally, I’d like to dwell on the
instructor’s handwriting. I sincere-
ly believe that it is possible to learn
the general charcter of a person

through an analysis of his
handwriting. This is known as
, graphology. Obviously, it is

impossible to say every much about
graphology here but there are
several excellent, inexpensive
books on the market about the
subject. Just by reading one of
these books, it would be possible
for a student to judge if he would
like the teacher of a course by that.

I had trouble deciding what
English literature course to take for
the fall term of last year. One
course looked very good but before
I made a decision I went to the
English department, found a pile of
old papers from that course, and

analyzed the teacher’s handwriting I

from the comments he wrote
around the papers.

The capital letters were extreme-
ly large compared to the small,
which usually denotes egotism.
The words were written with an
acutely inclined forward slant

 Battle Of Registration

which denotes a man of “great
passions, who is fervid, ardent,
easily offended, jealous, and even
hysterical. 50 said the text I used
in analyzing the writings. Other
indicators showed a tendency
toward sadism!

I then started to read the
comments. The last comment I
looked at said something like:
“F--Aaaw, The poor girl is
obviously in over her head. She
doesn’t belong in college.”

That did it! He might have liked
playing the Big Bad Wolf but I
would never play Little Red Riding
Hood opposite him. I chose
another course with a more civil
instructor.

Mainly, learn everything you can
about the courses you want to take
and the instructors of those
courses. In this age of Watergate,
however, it is best to keep your
investigations to matters of a most
general sort. In other words, don’t
dig for gossip or try to ﬁnd out
private matters. Not only is it rude
and even dishonest, it would be,
considering most of the teachers
I’ve known, a bit boring.

With the tactics I have mention-
ed in this paper, it is possible for
the lowly student to walk through
the Valley of Death and withstand
ambushes and surprise attacks
from the enemy and emerge

victorious. Eventually, the war will
be won. Or as one famous general
put it: “Old soldiers never die; they
just graduate.” .

Women Welcomed To Pitt

BY REGINA RATTIGAN

“Father Pitt” won't be watch-
ing over the female freshmen on
Lantern Night, September 12.

“Lantern Night is a way the
student women of the University
welcome freshman women,” Ran-
dy Adler, Panhellenic Association
chairperson, said about the 55-
year-old tradition she's in charge of
this year.

The absence of “Father Pitt," a
ceremony speaker who compared
the light of the lanterns to the light
of education, is one of the changes
Lantern Night has undergone.

The ceremony’s sponsorship
belonged to the Associated Women
Students until the Pitt Alumnae
and Thyrsa Ballantyne, Alumni
Associate, gained the responsibi-
lity in 1969.

“We wanted the tradition to
continue,” Ballantyne said.
“We've always worked closely with
the students.”

This year, the alumnae turned
the sponsorship over to the
Panhellenic Association.

In the first part of the ceremony,
the lanterns, which represent
inspiration from the alumnae, are
given to the freshmen women.
Upperclass women symbolically
share their hope for the future by
lighting the lanterns in the second
part.

Adler said the occasion is like a
big introduction. The future
members of campus women’s
organizations are all together at
once.

it was last year and the year before and the year before...

“The lanterns used today are
reproductions of those used for
studying by the ﬁrst Pitt stu-
dents,” Ballantyne said.
“Lantern Night is the oldest
tradition on campus.”

Candles may replace lanterns
this year, due to a reduced budget
of $540.

Although those ﬁrst Pitt students

helped only with the production of
the ceremony behind the scenes, in

WESLEY “WES” OPERASVAR

A History Of Pitt Complete With ‘Wes’  

BY BILL “WES” MOORE

. The end of the American ‘
' Revolution with the signing of the

Treaty of Paris in 1783 had been

history for little more than three’

years when a group of .men
gathered in a log cabin to sample
syrup and plan a school which
would teach “more than just the
first elements.”

On February 28, 1787, the
Pittsburgh Academy was charter-
ed. A group of high school
students had meant to charter a
bus to visit Niagrara Falls,

~but...well, you know how high

school students are.

The academy’s ﬁrst curriculum
—in 1789—included such courses
as:

—Psychodrama for Minutemen.
—Basic Math for Tories.

—A guide to Pittsburgh’s street.
—Fixing the town clock. s
—Making cute necklaces from
musketballs.

—Recycling redcoats. _
—And King George: Proﬁle of a
nincompoop.

All of the courses, including
Remedial Pledging of Allegiance to
the Flag, were taught by a Mr. L.D.
Sauvage,
descendant of Sir Walter Raleigh.

The Pittsburgh population had
expanded to a whopping 7,000
people when the school, on
February 18, 1819, became Wes-
tern University of Pennsylvania.

believed to be a-

The first Chancellor, Robert
“Wes” Bruce, was released from
Kane Hospital and began immedi-
ate changes. He renamed one
building, and built three more.

Students were at ﬁrst confused by
having four Bruce Halls as
classrooms, but soon caught on
when vice chancellor Paul “Wes”
Auslander renamed two of the

1 buildings Auslander Annex.

The early‘ days were not without
problems. Bruce Halls and
Auslander Annexes burnt down in
1845. 1 Cited for contributing to
Pittsburgh’s pollution industry
without a permit (they were $4.50,
or $3 if you knew the mayor), the
school was forced to close down.
Most of the students transferred to
Carlow College and became ugly.

A few transferred to Penn State
and became hicks, and one student
transferred to Duquesne and
became stupid.

The next ’ year, when the
University reopened, he was
named chancellor. Paul “Wes”
Pudge’s ﬁrst act as chancellor was

' to rename all of the buildings after

his children—Cathedral, Towers
and Original Hot Dog Shop Pudge.
His children were strange.

The curriculum vwas revised

under Pudge to include:

—Basic Horse Repair for Non-
Mechanics.

—The Written Word: A Good

‘Idea or a Passing Fancy.

—and Introduction to Why
Southerners Talk Funny.

In 1892, the University,gradua-
ted its first senior, Wesley “Wes”
Operasvar. Operasvar liked Pitt,
couldn't ﬁnd a girlfriend, and
wanted someday to be Chancellor,
so then-Chancellor Franklin
“Wes" Pangborn decided to admit
Operasvar as the school’s ﬁrst
graduate student. O.perasvar’s
major was Using Big Words.

Bernard Kobosky immigrated to
this country from Poland during the
Keilbasi Famine of 1890, and was
made Chancellor upon Pangborn’s
mysterious death. ’ (Pangborn was
found pinned under a massive
potato pancake. He died the next
day of acute gravy poisoning.)

Kobosky, known affectionately
by his students as “Wes,” is best
known for the way he handled
Pitt’s first student uprising. All 17
of Pitt’s undergraduate students
protested a tuition hike by
grabbing microphones from Pitt
officials and wearing funny shirts
which said “Woodstock. ’ ’ Kobos-
ky, upon hearing of the problem,
bought six kegs of beer and got the
class so drunk they forgot about it.
The party was held inwhat was
then known as Kobosky Hall, now

the Phi Eta Sigma house on North
Belleﬁeld.

In 1908, when a student jokingly
told Kobosky “This university is
the pits,” Kobosky opted to change
the name. It was renamed to

University of Kobosky at Pitts-
burgh, or Pitt.

The following year, Gabby»
,“Wes” Cathedral succeeded Ko-

bosky as chancellor and began a
massive building drive. It was
under his tenure that the Cathedral
of Gabby was erected. (Chancellor
Lackov “Wes” Learning later
changed that.) Gabby was quoted
in an early Pitt News as saying,
“The building should be more than
just a schoolhouse, it should be a
monstrosity.’ ’

The tallest school building in the
world, the Cathedral is a symbol of
Pitt pride. Chancellor Cathedral
invited different ethnic groups to
furnish Nationality Rooms on the
ﬁrst ﬂoor of the structure. They
included the South Side Room, the
Suburban Philadelphia Room and
the Erie’ Room, with a clever
dead-ﬁsh motif.

Fred “Wes” Fireﬂy was the next
chancellor. He is responsible for
nothing, and quit when he got his
ﬁrst paycheck.

Chancellor Harry “Wes” Towers
came in 1957 and launched a
dormitory building campaign. His
three children—Ajax, Borax, and
Chuckwagon——asked that the
dorms be named after them. They
weren’t.

Succeeding Towers, ﬁnally, was
current chancellor and past-gradu-
ate “Wes” Operasvar. Operasvar,
known for his fancy house, was the
ﬁrst Chancellor to shake hands

with each and every incoming

freshman. Enrollment dropped in
1968 when Operasvar contracted

poison ‘ivy, but quickly resurged. I

when his daughters joined the
reception line.
responsible for hiring vice chancel-
lors John, Majors and Tim
Gurgurich, ﬁnally putting‘ the
school into top intercollegiate

athletic status._
Operasvar still reigns as chancel-

lor, and except for an occasional

year in various states of intoxicati-.. ’

on, he has always been accessible
and cordial to students. So, too, is
Tony Dorsett, his Vice Chancellor
for Running Fast.

The Future? Pitt’s future is bold
and ‘exciting. The Operasvar Social
Science Complex behind Hillman
Library is nearing completion and
tuition is up to $1,210 per year.
Students are now paid to turn in
professors who swear in class, and
the Towers cafeteria will soon be
annexed by (appropriately) the
White Tower Cockroacharium.

A major expansion is planned for
the 1980s, including Dorsett Field
House, three small jails for
students who ask too many
questions and a large mock-up of
Vietnam as it was in 1970 for use by
ROTC students and knee-jerk
liberal journalism students.

Clearly, the strong, proud
tradition of the University of
“Wes” Pittsburgh leaves much to
be desired. Take for instance,
factuality.

BY KEN GORMLEY

So you’re ﬁnally in college. The
days are gone when you ‘get thrown
in a detention room for skipping
class. Or when you have to hide
behind the corner drug store to
catch a cigarette. I

Most importantly, you no longer
have to loiter suspiciously in front
of bars and offer old derelicts a
buck to pick up a six pack for you.

No sir. You’re in college now.

I And everyone knows college

students can buy beer, whiskey and

_ vodka for themselves...and plenty

of it. Because sitting in " bars
drinking until the wee hours is as
much apart of college as studying
history or dissecting white mice.
A That's what you think. Oakland
is like any other town in
Pennsylvania. You have to be
careful of how and where you
drink, or you'll end up drinking
water and eating black bread in a
downtown jail.

A few simple “do’s” and
“don’ts” about drinking should be
followed. Read them carefully.
They might save you from

spending the $38 ﬁne for underage
drinking.

(Keep in mind that

You’re In College Now

money could be spend on better
things—-such as forty quarts of
beer, 25 quarts of wine or six ﬁfths
of your favorite whiskey.

no um IN norms AND
HOUSES

Let’s get one thing straight. If
you are a non-drinker, you
shouldn’t feel obligated to drink
alcoholic beverages. There are
plenty of people in college who
prefer a tall Ginger Ale to a
Genessee Cream Ale any day of the
week (with the possible exception
of New Year's and Al Luccione’s
birthday).

But if you are one of the
multitude who long ago gave in to
the urge for the magic juices,
there’s no reason to do your
drinking in the corner of the high
school playground or at the drive-in
anymore. Remember—you’re in
college now.

If you live on campus, you have a
dormroom or an apartment. And if
you’re a commuter, some”of your
new friends are bound to have a
cozy room (especially if you choose
your friends carefully). Feel free to
sit around with a few of your chums
and do your drinking there. As
long as you don’t cause a ruckus,
nobody will bother you.

(NOTE: If you hﬂ tendency
to get plastered and run around the
halls and streets half naked,
singing the Russian National
Anthem and making bird calls-—
you might ask a friend to lock you
in your room and swallow the key
before you begin the festivities).

DO DRINK AT PARTIES—BUT
BE CAREFUL

Parties are an important part of
college life. You go to them to
celebrate the end of a hard week of
classes (or a hard week of thinking
up excuses for skipping classes).
You go to them to meet people.

But the local police like to go to
parties too, if the hoopla gets out of
hand. here are a few simple ways
to tell if a party has gone too far:

1. If you’re on the way to a big
bash and feel the sidewalk shaking
eight blocks away from the music.

2. If you arrive an_d ﬁnd a
welcoming committee passed out in
a puddle of what-used-to-be-dinner
in front of the house. _

3. If you ﬁnd the house packed
wall-to-wall with people chugging
garbage pails full of beer and
singing the Russian National
Anthem in part harmony.

If you spot any of these tell-tale
signs, it might be time to turn

around and search for a safer party.

The local police don’t barge in on
college ‘parties very often. But if
they do...you won't be around to
tell the tale. '

One of the safer places to drink ‘

yourself into oblivion is at the
fraternity houses. In the beginning
of each term, most frats throw a
string of parties that are good for a
number of reasons. They're
swarming with people to meet, the
men in blue rarely raid them and
they're free to underclassmen.
(This is a_ real bonanza for the
accomplished drinker.) '

DON’T FREQUENT BARS

Go ahead and say it. You’re dern
tired of being lectured to “stay out
of bars young man and young lady,

or you’ll become an alcoholic like -
his ,

your Uncle Al...God rest
intoxicated soul.” You’ve heard it
a million times, and you don’t want
to hear it again.

But unless you’re one of those
rare humans who displayed secon-
dary sex characteristics at the age
of four and were mistaken for your
playmates’ parents by the time you
were ﬁfteen—you’d better STAY

OUT OF BARS. (Sorry. But it had .

to be said.) Otherwise, you might
be nabbed by the...God. Even the
thought of it. chills the bones...by
the LCB.

how do they operate? The

following is an eyewitness account 3,5‘

by a local bartender. Remember—-
this could be you!

(NOTE: This story could be
moderately to horrendously exag-
gerated, depending on how drunk
the bartender was when he told it).
_ Jim “Chugalug” ‘ Smith and
Mary “Tequila” Jones sat pom-
pously on the barroom stools,
sucking down drinks and playing
footsies in the shadows of the beer
joint. It was Friday afternoon, and
they were going to enjoy themsel-

, ves. After all—it had been a rough

week of classes.

“Two ' more of the same,
bartender,” Jim hooted, and
slapped a $10 dollar bill on_the
counter. The couple made quick
work of the drinks, and broke into a
spirited chorus of the Russian
National Anthem.

They didn’t even notice the two
inconspicuous gentlemen who had
been seated at a table behind them
and were now talking to the
bartender.

One of the men stepped outside,
and returned minutes later. He
was accompanied by three burly
State policemen who looked mean-
er than a bulldog who’s just been
stung in the rear-end by a bee, The
door was. locked behind them.

‘i\_

.2-..

l.
v-,7‘-.

“This is a routine LCB check,” I

one of the gentlemen announced in
a monotone. “Please produce your
identiﬁcation. ’ "

By this time, Jim and Mary’s
thoroughly intoxicated minds com-
prehended what was happening.
Jim slunk to_ the dark ﬂoor and
crawled quietly into the bathroom.
Mary downed her last shot of
Tequila and fumbled around in her
purse.

“Identiﬁcation, please” one of
the agents said grufﬂy. Mary’s
heart pounded wildly as
handed him a forged library card.

“This won’t do” he snapped.
“I’m afraid you’ll have to come
with me. By the way, where’s your
boyfriend?”

“Here he is,” said the other
agent. He escorted Jim—who was
desperately clinging to a wad of
toilet paper—out of the men’s
room. ' - w
Jim and Mary, along with ﬁve
other hapless minors, were hustled
downtown where their true ages
were discovered. They were
arrested, booked and fined $38.
Poor .lim—no more hopes of going
to law school. Poor Mary—no more
“money for books” from mom and
dad.

The moral of the story—don’t
frequent bars...unless you like to
live dangerously (or plan to join the
merchant marines in the near

. future).

“Jimminy Christmas,” you
might lament. “Can’t the LCB and
bar owners cut us minors a break?
They were young once. Didn’t they
get fed up with all the restrictions
on underage drinking?”

“Nope,” says Barney, owner of
The Wooden Keg. “It didn’t
bother me ‘cause I didn’t drink. In
fact, I still don’t’ drink. That stuff is
no good for you.”

And Barney’s probably smarter
than all of us. Because he’s raking

in barrel after barrel of our money.

Pigeons, Free For The Asking

BY BILL MOORE

Economic scholar Milton
Friedman made a reputation on the
pithy statement—-“There is no
such thing as a free lunch.”

If economics were that simple,
universities would be deluged with
econ majors. It isn’t, and they
aren’t. Regardless, Friedman was
right. There is no such thing as a
free lunch. There is no such thing
as a free anything, actually, since
taxes support the world nowadays;

But since you are paying for
them anyway, it is a waste not to
take advantage of those few things
left that seem free.

Take Carnegie" Library. It seems
free, and is overflowing with not
just books, but pictures, newspa-
pers, drawings, records and
movies. Ditto Hillman Library,
which you support with both taxes
and University fees.

Carnegie Library is connected to
Carnegie Museum, across Forbes
from the Cathedral. Although not

HOUSE PASSES VW BILLS

HARRISBURG (AP)—A package
of legislation to help finance the
placement of a Volkswagen assem-
bly plant in Pennsylvania was
approved yesterday by the House.

The three bills, each of which
passed by margins of more than
ﬁve to one, still need Senate
approval next week.

The package provides
million for a rail spur and a
one-mile highway link to the plant,
located at New Stanton near
Pittsburgh.

It also appropriates $10 million to
the Pennsylvania Industrial Devel-
opment Authority, part of a $40
million PIDA loan to be used to
acquire and complete the plant.

$26.9.

free, the museum accepts as
meager a donation as your
conscience allows as admission.
Full of some beautiful art and
artifacts, educational exhibits, fas-
cinating dinosaurs and a tacky
stuffed animal collection, the
museum is good for an afternoon.
On top of that is the outside and
inside building architecture, which
is well worth examining. But more
on that later.

Connected to the two Carnegies

.is the Sarah Scaife gallery.

Picasso, Rembrandt, all of the
masters are represented except
Gary Trudeau. Like Carnegie
Museum, there is a ‘donation, but it
is well worth it. ‘For art majors, it is
worth much more.

Phipps Conservatory, across the
bridge, stands out. It is a massive
greenhouse with not only ﬂowers,
but also rubber plants‘, and actual
fruit-bearing trees. It is a beautiful
sight, and one few cities have.

The Conservatory is at the
entrance to Schenley Park. If trees
or sunshine are all you are after,
few parks beat Schenley. It’s big

' and rolling enough to offer a choice

of friendly Flagstaff Hill with
people and frisbees, or unfriendly
Panther Hollow with solitude and

_ silence.

Schenley Park also has the Boy
Scout Museum, which is one of the
wor1d’.s worst, but free. It’s small
and geared" for three year olds, but
the pet "squirrel is cute.

Schenley Park is by no way alone
in this city. ‘ Le_t’s see...there’s
Point State Park downtown with the
fountain, Frick Park with the hiking
trails, Highland Park with the Zoo,
Mellon Park with the Arts and
Crafts Center, and Riverview Park
with the Allegheny Observatory.
All are free for sunning or watching

Irish Setters stretch their legs. The
Zoo is only free on Saturdays, or if
you are brash enough to slip over a
fence or through the employes
entrance. '
Every city has parks and
museums and art galleries, though.
The best part of Pittsburgh, you
will learn, is Pittsburgh. Oakland
has it's attractions, but Pittsburgh
is one in itself. The views from the
top of the Cathedral or U.S. Steel
Building are tremendous, and the
view from Mount Washington is
unparallelled. And close up, if you
know where to look, it is even
better.

For institutional architecture,
downtown Pittsburgh is unbeat-
able. The modern architecture of
the new Equibank building is nice,
and the ancient architecture of the
numerous shops, office buildings,
and county complexes are tremen-
dous. Downtown Pittsburgh is
bearable if you look straight ahead,
but look up .along the rows of
concrete facades and it is amazing.

Some occasional freebies—as
opposed to
eternal institutions—include mov-
ies, plays and concerts.

Pittsburgh is big on free
Symphony concerts or City Players
plays in the various parks during
the summer and early fall. They
aren’t really for us, they’re for the
tourists, but strap a camera around
your neck and no one will ‘ever
know.

Closer to home, Pitt's Pangbom
Film Club occasionally screens free
ﬁlms. It is a non-profit club, so
when the coffers get crowded, the
ﬂicks are free. Free ﬁlms are
shown, too, outside (inside if it
rains) of the Carnegie complex on
summer Sunday nights. Close-to-

the forementioned -

IS a relief on summer days, but ominous on winter nights.

free movies run all year round at
Pitt, C-MU, Carlow, and Chatham
Colleges.

Also, mostly during the summer
and early September, the city's
too-numerous-to-list ethnic groups
hold carnivals or festivals which are
free to visit. The food costs, but
not much.

Occasionally, and let's hope this‘
year is one of those occasions, a
free concert is held on Schenley
Park's Flagstaff Hill. Past
headliners include Bruce Spring-
steen and his old “E” Street

Shufﬂe and Earl Scruggs and his

revue.

The city also has three rivers——
the Ohio, the Monongahela and the
Allegheny. They are free, too.

Not to mention the free" pollution,
trafﬁc, abuse, muggings, noise,

litter, insensitivity, bus exhaust~ '

and obnoxious disc jockeys.

The best way to keep abreast of
what’s free or cheap in the

city—and most of these events, you . 3v" Q

will find, are near or in Oakland—is

  

to read either of Pittsburgh's two . 

free newspapers.

parking lots close to classes all
have daily rates over $1.50 so it
pays to park a little farther off and
hike.

For less than $1 a day, you can
leave your car in the lot near Trees
Hall and take the campus bus down
from the hill. The bus -is scheduled
to run every 15 minutes, but it so
rarely comes on time, you should
only count on it arriving every half
hour. The bus is often jammed and

- doesn’t even have standing room.

On those days, you'll probably wish
you had a brick to put through the
window when it passes you up.
There is one good point about the
campus bus, though. It's free and
circles most of the campus.

If the prospect of leaving your
car in the Trees lot and waiting for
the bus sounds dreadful, you can
park in Panther Hollow at the lower
end of campus near Schenley Park.
This lot, too, costs less than $1 for a
day's space.

There also are quite a few lots
several blocks away from the

commuters.

The Board seeks to increase the awareness, understanding
and appreciation of a variety of cultural art forms, issues oriented
programs, lectures and social oriented activities. A

Cathedral so it's a good idea to
drive around a little during your
first week at Pitt to see just
what’s convenient for you.

If your classes are scheduled
early enough, there are a couple of
free spaces you might be able to
grab. Remember, though, there
are thousands of University em-
ployes who start working at 8:30
a.m. who will beﬁghting for these
choice spots. '

Two rows of parking spaces
across from Phipps Conservatory
are free. And there are one or two
near the Board of Education
building on Bellefield Street.
Oakland Avenue and Atwood
Streets don’t_have meters either,
but the spots usually are taken by
neighborhood residents.

After you've managed to park
your car (or have waited 20 minutes
for the PAT bus that brings you
to Oakland), you might feel a little
left out at first. “I don’t know
anyone here. Those dorm students
have it made.”

     

park your limousine like all of the other Pitt

The UNION BOARD is comprised of thee committees,
SOCIAL,‘ PUBLIC AFFAIRS and the ARTS. Each of these com-
mittees has its own student chairman with 15 or so members who
meet weekly volunteering their time at designing and implement-

This lot opposite the Cathedral may look like it can accommodate a

 

lot of cars, but wait until September. Just try to ﬁnd a space for your

VW.

Not true. Remember, when you
get to classes, commuters—not
dormers—are the majority. The
reason that fellow sitting next to
you isn’t talking is probably
because he feels as left out as you
do. .

Commuters seem to congregate
in the Student Union lobby and the
Cathedral Commons Room.
They’re easy to pick out because
they often carry little brown bags
ﬁlled with homemade lunches.
Maybe someone will trade you an
apple for half of your peanut
butter-and-jelly sandwich.

Although it's usually hard for
commuters to attend campus
events that take place at night,
there are many things that go on

~ during the day. Groups on campus

often sponsor speakers or ﬁlms
during the day'so, instead of sitting
in Hillman Library during your
two-hour break between classes,
you may want to attend. These
events are listed in the Marquee

The uniqueness of this campus programming group is that

it seeks to encourage its membership to become involved at its
level and ability as ones academic schedule permits.

Who’s Who and What’s What at Pitt

BY CONNIE GIEL
AND MATTHEW KENNEDY

Most people, after living in a
community for some time, get to
know the ins and outs of their
hometown; who makes decisions
and who can make a difference with
a particular problem.

‘Not so with the University. For

most freshmen it’s just the"

beginning of a four-year trip in the
University community. By the time
they’re ready to graduate they can
put their ﬁnger on where to go and
who to see. Alas, too late-to solve
the problems of freshman year.

The following is a sampling of
key people and services within the
University. These people can
inﬂuence your environment at Pitt
and have a responsibility to serve
your needs. The services are
funded by your money, and for
your use.

Read on, and maybe you won’t
have to wait four years to start
learning the not-so-mysterious
ways of the Universitv community.

  Gentleman and A Scholar

BY A. IRENE SCHMIDT

“Curly, I'm going to check the

.. I ﬁrst floor now,” said LD Sauvage
O V to the young black man behind the

Pitt Student Information Desk. He
swung down the hall and “Hold
that elevator! ” up to the ﬁrst ﬂoor,
jangling his massive key ring.
“Everything all right in here?”
he asked a student in one of the

; rooms, his lanky frame leaning into

the doorway.

“Yeah...I guess so,” the kid
said. He looked confused. He’d
never seen LD before, and the lined
Shakespearean face with its gray
beard and kind blue eyes seemed
strangely out of place in the cold
beige Student Union hall.

_LD took off down the hall, the
hand-carved, one-of-a-kind wooden
Danish pipe his daughter had given
him leaving faint puffs of smoke
hanging in the stale air. It's part of
the’ routine, the three times each
night he walks the halls rattling
doorknobs and checking for un-
necessary lights, part of what the
Student Union House Manager
does.

Back downstairs in the over-
crowded Union Ticket Ofﬁce A, LD
pulls the list of job duties he has
arranged from under the welter of
papers and notebooks which clutter
The list is overly
long--“Check Information Desk
cash register. Checkthat student
aide is on duty.”--a sad attempt to
impute importance to a job which is
a frustrating waste of talent to the
man ‘who holds it.

“There are some very stimulat-

' ing things about this job,” he says.

‘‘I get’ a great deal of satisfaction
working with the students.” He
shrugs, and the raspy Midwestern

voice sounds suddenly tired. He
knows it’s mostly rationization.

He hasn’t forgotten those years
of education, not the two years of
architectural engineering, the
major in elementary school educa-
tion, the minor in industrial arts.
He hasn't forgotten the masters in
agriculture, the doctorate in special
education.

“My daddy always said, ‘Get a
good education, son, they can’t
take that away from you.‘ Sure,
but now you can’t sell it either. No
way I'm satisﬁed here, with this
salary or misuse of education and
experience. But, Ican’t get a job.”

He laughs incredulously, hardly
believing it himself. “Really, I've
been here six years and the sixteen
offers I’ve gotten have all been for
pay for about $3;000 to $5,000 less
than I was making before I ﬁnished
my doctoral work. After all, this
education, I can’t do that. I have a
family, too.”

Not all of the “wife, ﬁve.kids,
two dogs, two cats and a hamster“
LD lists as family still live in the
Penn Hills project-type housing
development. Gretchen, Lauren,
and Kevin have followed their
father’s educational footsteps at
colleges and universities in Mich-
igan, Colorado and North Carolina.

His oldest daughter, Lauren,
recently began work at a hospital,
doing research with geriatric
patients. She has a degree in
anthropology and art history. He
laughs wryly when he talks about
her. He knows that frustration only *
too well.

“We’re all over-qualiﬁed,” he
insists, stalking through the nether
regions of the Union, past the
double doors of the kitchen, over
the concrete ﬂoors.

“One job I applied for had about
1,000 other applicants. All for one
job! With all my business
experience and ‘qualiﬁcations, no
one will hire me, except for
short-term research with soft
money--government funds. You
apply for most teaching jobs, they
give you the big treatment, you
visit the campus, you’re one of the
final candidates, and then you ﬁnd
they gave the job to someone with a
lot less experience than you,
because they can pay him less. I’m
not fresh out of college,‘ with no
responsibilities. I can’t afford
that.”

LD dropped out of high school in
Michigan because, regardless of
his father's advice,_ he felt “When
you can be making $500 a month,
why go on conjugating Latin
verbs?” Although LD returned to
his studies in the following years,
he also built and’ operated four
successful businesses during that
time. The tandem-bike rental, the
miniature golf course and the
Willowbrook Inn” were summer
enterprises, but each grossed
between $5,000 and $25,000 a
summer. In addition, he managed
a franchised ﬁne silverware, china,
and crystal business which brought
$75,000 when he sold it to move to
Pennsylvania to further his educ-
ation. _

“The only way I would go back to
industry,” he says, “is for the

same thing I want to do at‘

school--research. That’s what I’m
going to do. Teach and do
research. If I had my druthers, as
they say, it would be in Vancouver,
British Columbia. That’s beautiful
country. But I'll be happy
anywhere I can sail, hike, ﬁsh--all
those. things. I have never lived

where I was bored, though. There
are always interesting things to do,
always.”

One of the interests closest to
LD’s heart is his poetry. He is very
proud ' of the National Award he
won in 1970 for the poem, “Finally
I’m Really Me.” Although poetry
may come first, he is also
interested in other types of writing,
such as short features and novels.

“I heard the story about LD and
his son,” said a student in the
Union. “LD wrote this '-book, I
guess it was a novel, and he had a
manuscript‘ in these boxes. Well,
somehow his ‘son got the boxes
mixed up with trash, and they all
got thrown out. LD, like, almost
destroyed him.“

Despite such setbacks, LD is now
seven chapters into a novel. But
again, the frustration surfaces. He

considers thetime between early

late evening and early morning his
peak hours of alertness and
creativity. The 4 p.m‘. to midnight

.._+_+u.

rme sot of his job leaves him
physically tired during the time he
would most like to write. In
addition, everyone else is asleep
when he is just getting home from
work.

The threat of frustration which
runs through LD’s life is not easily
apparent to Pitt students. There’s
a. concert in the Lower Lounge
tonight, and LD is exaltant.

“These boys play some of the
best New Orleans jazz ever,” he
exhorts students on the upper
floors. “They’re great, absolutely
fantastic. Stop down later.”

He screws up his face to an
extra-wide smile and a wink, a
characteristic expression of simul-
taneous approval and dismissal. ' ’

“LD’s great, isn’t he?” asked
someone after he has disappeared
down the steps. “He really seems
to get a kick out of working at this

 

place. He's always floating
around.” ,

BY SUSAN MANNELLA

Cafeteria food may be a novelty
for the ﬁrst day or so, but after
three days of dorm life, it can be
tiresome. You see, the same
dishes are served in the cafeteria
about every fourth day.

If you’ll be living on dorm food
(or cooking for yourself in an
apartment) you will get hungry.

If you want to stop your growling
belly and don’t really care what
kind of garbage ﬁlls it, there are
plenty of cheap restaurants in

Care Packages

There are the usual chains where

“you probably went while cutting‘
-classes in high school——McDon-

ald's, Roy Rogers, Arbys and that
ever-popular monopoly of the
highways, Howard Johnson's.

But Oakland also boasts a few
troughs of the fast food variety that
you won't find in every big and
small town in the country. The
Original Hot Dog Shop has a
reputation for hot dogs and grease,
but you can buy a real jumbo ﬁsh
sandwich and the greatest choco-
late milkshake this side of Hershey,
Pa. The “O" is located on the
CL rner of South Bouquet Street and
Forbes Avenue, across from the
Law School.

One block over and around the
corner on Oakland Avenue there’s
the New Colony Restaurant-
another sandwich place, but a nice
change from the mass-produced
fare.

If you saved some of your
summer earnings, you should try
C. J. Barney's. on Forbes Avenue,
right under the dorms. The menu
consists of hamburgers and ome-
lettes——about 25 varieties from an
American cheeseburger to bleu
cheese and ham combinations on
either a burger or mixed in the

omelette. Prices run over $2, but
the food is good. '

Pizza freaks take heart. You can ~

eat it for a week without leaving
Oakland and without entering the
same restaurant twice. There’s a
pizzeria on almost every corner in
the area, but none are exceptional.
Pizza fans will just have to shop
around.

Most pizza places also serve
hoagies, but the best in the area
come from The Wooden Keg.
(There are two Wooden Kegs on
Forbes Avenue———one is a bar. the
other, a sandwich joint. The hoagie
place is in the block between
Atwood Street and Oakland Ave-
nue.

For variety, there are three
Middle Eastern restaurants in
Oakland: Khalil’s, located on
Semple Street; BaAlbek on Atwood
Street; and Palmyra, on the corner
of Atwood and Bates Street. All
three offer everything from shish
kebab to baklava. Ba Albek
features a bellydancer. Khalil’s
features great spinach pies and
delicious salads.

These are small, family-run
places and, if you ask, waitresses
usually will tell you what's good
that day. Dinners are not

cheap—over $5 in most cases—but
if you stick with a la carte items,
you can load up for about $3.

One spot to keep in mind for
when Mom and Dad come to visit
(but only if you like Italian food) is
Minutello’s, located at the corner
of Fifth and Shady Avenues in East
Liberty. Dinners run between $5
and $8. Eggplant Parmigiana is a
speciality.

Of course there are dozens of
other restaurants in the immediate
area that I'm forgetting. ignoring
or running out of space for. You
won’t starve. And, depending on
how much money you save from
high school graduation gifts, you
might even be able to buy
something that tastes good.

But for my $2.95, -the best deal is
a rueben sandwich from the
Gazebo, on Walnut Street in
nearby Shadyside. Don't spring for
it unless you're really hungry. And
steer clear of this place if you have
intentions of staying on a diet—the
deli-bakery in the front of the
restaurant has an inventory of at
least six million calories in pastry.

Be sure to tell your family,
though, that despite all of the
restaurants nearby, there’s nothing
like a care packagefrom home.

Items of this type are naturally the textbooks, used books, and paper-
backs. Second, trade department items are made available that are
necessary to supplement and complement the course study and to en-
hance. the cultural and academic significance of the University. Third,
supply department on the lower ﬂoor has supply items for your every
need, paper, notebooks, typewriters, and hundreds of- other items.

12,000 cloth titles are displayed in separate sections by subject cate-
gories. Periodicals and Journals (scholarly, literary, professional, and
c, technical) are displayed in this area.

Textbooks

The Textbook Department is located on lower ﬂoor.

Arts Editor

Take it from we upperclass people--college is not all school; it
offers mucho other lighter pleasures. (Unless you happen to work on
the Pitt News, in which case college is journalism with little time left

for anything else).

‘At any rate, Oakland is considered the cultural hotspot of Pittsburgh.
And for entertainment, it is rivaled only by downtown’s Market Square

and the notorious Liberty Avenue

stretch. So, whether it’s drama,

ﬂicks, or bars that makes you feel at home, Oakland’s got it, with
several options to chose from, at that.
We, the arts people, have assembled a collection of articles

containing necessary (info for

your campus,-Pittsburgh orien-

tation. Throughout the year we will supply you with weekly doses of

“what’s going down around town.’

Good reading.

Theatres: Ambitious,
But Not Good Enough

BY TOBI ROSEN

Pittsburgers are getting bolder.
At least, that’s what many area
theatre producers are hoping.

The Pittsburgh Public’ Theatre
seems to be going out on the
longest limb. Their inaugral season

wag expectantly termed _f.;’?safe§".*;l;y'* .

every drama desk in thehcity. "And
riglitly so.

Tihey needed to cultivate an
audience so they chose plays
tailered not to offend anyone.
Tennessee Williams’ “The Glass
Managerie,” Dale Wasserman's
“One Flew Over The Cuckoo’s
Nest” and Shakespeare’s “Twelfth
Night” provided even-quality food,
but not very much thought.

But this season opens with an
unconﬁrmed bang. In fact, there
are many “bangs” to be sounded
in Arthur Kopit’s Indians. It's a
brash, cynical look back into our
(nation's heroes and history. We are
taken back to the days Buffalo Bill
Cody and his Wild West show. In
spite of the comic element, Kopit
never loses sight of the degradation

against humanity.

With the Public’s spacial design,
“lndians" will easily lend itself to a
rodeo atmosphere.

The Trial

BY DAVID ASHLEY

Jewel Walker and Leon Katz’s
adaptation of Franz Kafka’s novel
The Trial, directed by Walker at
the Allegheny Community Theater,
 a disappointment—the more so
‘because this is the opportunity for
teally compelling and gripping
theater.

In the hands of an imaginative
and competent director, the drama-
-tization of the mechanism by which
an individual’s identity is destroy-
ed by a faceless state bureaucracy
could have more than just a
ﬁctional or historical signiﬁcance.
This. however is not to be.

Kafka’s novel details the "ar-
rest" (the prisoner is never
officially taken into custody) and

Anton Chekov will be the second
playwright mounted by the Public.
They have not yet announced which_
play will be done. But whichever is
chosen, it will be in desperate need
of ‘subtle direction:.. I

Chekov is not the most “active”
of, playwrights. It is to be hoped
that artistic director? Ben Shaktman

will import a guest director familiar

with the nuances of Chekovian
drama.

Shakespeare’s “Henry V” will
round out the second season. It is
one‘ of the lesser-known histories
andnwill be ﬁghting the premise
that “histories are boring.” I
assure you, this play is not.

There has been some rumors
that the Public may expand its

format to include midnight read-

ings/workshops. New plays and
directors can wet their feet without
the Public taking a great ﬁnancial
plunge. It seems to be a worthwhile
investment allaround.

With the loss of the Nixon
Theatre, the Pittsburgh Public
assumes sole responsibility for
presenting professional theatre in
the city.

For those who do not wish to
venture up to the North Side, there
will be some interesting theatre at

Concert

Hall
Size-up

BY M. PATRICK MONAHAN

I'm sure there are many music
lovers among the freshmen coming
to Pitt this week. And if live music
is your cup of tea, here is a brief
description of some Pittsburgh»
concert halls and a list of events
slated to occupy them this summer.

Civic Arena: This is perhaps
Pittsburgh's most frequently used
facility for live music. The Arena is
located downtown, on Centre

Avenue near Chatham Center. It -

has a capacity of about 17,500, but
like all similar sports’ arenas across
the country, visibility is limited and
the acoustics lousy. This is a

handicap if the act playing is-

predominately soft-rock or folk, but
most of the groups frequenting the
Arena are either hard rock or soul.
Evaluation: An adequate place
for live music, and other than
Three Rivers Stadium, the only
place where major acts will appear.

Upcoming Arena Shows:

—June 22, England’s Yes, with
the Pousette Dart Band, 8 p.m. '

—June",26,r'sou1.;,?i‘i:i£1isic from the
Isley Brothers, ‘

—July 10, .-’San*_Francisco rock
group Jefferson A Starship and
Henry Gross',’8 p.m-. ‘

—July 15,, Stephen Stills, Neil
Young and the Stills/Young Band,
8 p.m.

Syria Mosque: This 3,800-seat
hall has been called “acoustically
perfect.” That claim may be a bit
much, but, nevertheless, the
Mosque is a ﬁne place for.live
music. The atmosphere is
intimate, but not cramped. Plus, a
good view of the stage is possible
from just about any seat in the
house. i

The Mosque is used primarily for
acoustic and country-rock, with an
occasional hard rock or jazz act.
Evaluation: Closest thing Pitts-
burgh has to a perfect concert hall;
and it is located near the Pitt
campus, on Bigelow Boulevard.

Upcoming Syria Mosque Shows:

-—July 2, Seals and Crofts, two
shows at 7:30 p.m. and 10 p.m.

AND NORM MARTELLO

“Turn your lights down low
and listen to the masters of the
radio.
Get in touch with God
Turn your radio on.”
—Albert E. Brumley

If music has ever touched your
very soul (ever try to tell a stranger
about rock’n’ roll?), then here is
necessary information on Pitts-
burghfs magic music machine» for
your stay at Pitt.

Our radio survey would not be
complete without mention of Pitt’s
closed-circuit (you can only receive
it in the dorms) AM-music mother,
WPGH, 640. As a welcome to new
students and a reminder to old,
WPGH is broadcasting outdoors
froir a truck in the quadrangle ‘near

4- A

the Bookstore and willmbe giving
away an album every hour,
including solo albums and the
collective efforts of Yes. Freshman

orientation broadcast hours include -

7 a.m. to 2 a.m. on Monday and
Tuesday, and 7 a.m. to 2 p.m. on
Wednesday.

“WPGH does not necessary I

follow national music trends. It
follows campus trends,” program
director Lee ,Lilienthal (air alias
Jerry Grant) said. “This year

programming will be mostly rock,"
with some ,j,a_z,z, ;, .soul,_._ ‘reggae. and .

progressive country. From seven
to nine in the evening there will be
ﬂock programming.” These will
be special programs devoted
entirely to jazz, "FM oldies and top
40 oldies, among others.”

    

Home Pitt Panther basketball
and hockey games, as well as all
conference basketball games are
carried by WPGH.

Hourly newscasts and a daily,

half-hour comprehensive news
program with an emphasis ‘on
campus news, seeks to expand
reports of this ABC news afﬁliate.

If your interests lie in‘ news
reporting or any other aspect of
radio, call WPGH. They’re located
on the third ﬂoor of the Student

. _ Union.

: Unimaginative Production 7

"proceedings" made by "the
authorities” against one Joseph
K., apparently an innocuous bank
clerk. The charges remain
ineffable, “the authorities” are
never identiﬁed exept as servants
to some higher and more amor-
phous power, and. worst 0 all, the
victim learns rapidly that, while he
has no control over or understand-
ing of his persecutors, his every
thought and movement has the
greatest signiﬁcance for them.
The City Players’ production of
"The Trial" opens with Joseph K.
asleep in his boardinghouse room
on the morning of this thirtieth
birthday. The set successfully
(perhaps unintentionally) creates
an atmosphere that is oppressive,
anonymous and full of foreboding. 9

Yet, as his alarm sounds, Joseph
K. leaps out of bed, sings “Happy
Birthday” to himself, and skips-
yes, skips—over to a chair where
he dons a sweatshirt and engages
in vigorous calisthenics for at least

20 seconds. This is typical of the’

major blunders committed in the
direction of this play.

Presumably, the intent of this
rather forced clowning is to portray
Joseph K. as a happy, carefree
fellow. Not only does this fail to get
sociologically, but it also strips the
central character of his essential
dignity, individuality and authenti-
city. It is hard to be concerned with
the attrition of personhood where
none previously existed.

Other scenes are more success-
ful. Those that portray‘ Joseph K.

V l

at work in his ofﬁce are carefully
and thoughtfully crafted. Subordi-
nates approach K.’s desk as if they
were being moved along invisible
grooves and deposit pices of paper
which K. rhythmically signs.

The relationship is totally bu-
reaucratic——no attention is paid or
consideration given to the indivi-
dual.

In later scenes where Joseph K.
sits despairingly at his desk
oblivious of the presence of others,
the little slips of paper are still
deposited on his desk for what
seems to be a prescribed period of
time and then dutifully if uselessly
collected. The conspicuous inclusi-
on of a piece of office machinery

.'A volunteer-operated outlet,
WYEP-FM (91.5) provides the
widest musical selection in Pitts-
burgh.

Their music ranges from jazz to
soul, blues, country and bluegrass,
rock, contemporary and traditional
folk music, as well as music from
all over the world. Onerof the best
programs is soul music from the
four corners of the globe’ (concen-
trating on the, Caribbean) on
Sundays,.2 a.m. to 6 a.m. While
their broadcast day generally ends
at midnight, plans call for
expanding to nightime with jazz
and blues.

n

i. \./e

WYEP seeks to be an alternative

to other Pittsburgh stations in }

terms of music and information, as
well as trying to destroy the myth
that career specialists are neces-
sary for putting out good radio
sound. As a community-access
station, WYEP’s facilities, at 4
Cable Place, off Semple ‘Street in
South’ Oakland, are open to
community groups.

Some of ’YEP’s current projects
include a ‘reggae spectacular this
Saturday evening, and three
showings of “The Harder They
Come” with Jimmy Cliff at Pitt’s
Benedum Auditorium on Friday
evening, June 25.» A special day of
bicentennial programming is being
planned for July 4, as well as a
picnic "for listeners" and ca'sh-contri-
buting -subscribers’ , in .1 Schenley
Park on July 16.

Volunteers willing to learn are
needed by ‘YEP.for a_myriad of
projects. For more information,
call 687-0200 during business
hours. I .

Two other public-supported rad-
io stations, WDUQ-FM, 90.5 and
WQED-FM 89.3, offer alternative
listening to Pittsburghers. WDUQ
emphasizes information from Na-
tional Public Radio. They are also
one of Pittsburgh's heaviest jazz

    

stations, programming from 10 pm
to 1 a.m. weekdays and 8 p.m. to 1

a.m. weekdays. WQED’s “The
Jazz Decades” presents classic jazz
from the '20s through the ’50s on
Fridays at 10 p.m. Otherwise they
program predominantly classical
music with stiff-sounding announ-
cers.

If you want to learn all the words
to the current songs you'll get
ample opportunity to hear a
constant rehash of less than 30
sprigs on 13Q, 1320 AM, and

 

 

WPEZ-FM, 94. If album-cut rock is
your bag, try WYDD-FM, 104.7.

They call their format free-form
progressive, containing mostly rock
and some current jazz.

“The music speaks for itself,"
announcer Jack Robertson said.
“We like exposing new artists."
When WYDD leaves the air at 1
a.m., the other prog rocker,
WDVE-FM (102.5), gets a bit
looser with their every-song-is-pro-

(Continued from Page I 8)

Stanley Theatre; Has not been

used much as of late, but this

3,800-seat hall probably will have
quite a musical potpourri of shows
in the fall, winter and spring.
Recently renovated, the Stanley,
like the Mosque, offers a good view
of the stage from just about any
seat. The Stanley is located
downtown on Seventh Avenue.
Evaluation: Shows at the Stanley
start at 7:30 p.m., a half hour
earlier than most Pittsburgh
concert venues. This makes it
convenient to enjoy downtown
nightspots afterwards.

Soldiers and Sailors Hall: Used
almost exclusively for jazz acts.
Gato Barbieri, Chick Corea, Larry
Coryell and Dave Brubeck are
among the people who have
appeared there during the past two
years. It is located on Fifth
Avenue. right across from the Pitt
Student Union. Evaluation: Not
designed for music, but an
acceptable jazz hall.

Upcoming Soldiers and Sailors
show:

—-June 27, Kenny Rankin and
The Eric Johnson Quartet, at 9
p.m.

Three Rivers Stadium: Home of
the Pirates and Steelers, Three
Rivers is occasionally used for
outdoor concerts. — Located on
Pittsburgh's Northside, this huge
stadium’s capacity is more than
50,000, and is great if you want to
get a suntan. Otherwise, it is
horrendous for live music.
Evaluation: Has had some big
names appear in the past (Led
Zeppelin, Allman Brothers, Eric
Clapton, Chicago and the Doobie
Brothers), but it’s large crowds
tend‘ to get a bit rowdy. Attend
with caution.

Upcoming Three Rivers show:

—July 24, the Eagles, Fleetwood
Mac, and Boz Scaggs, at 2 p.m.

Heinz Hall: Located on Sixth
Avenue, downtown, this 2,800-seat
hall caters to the" older set. Stage
shows, opera, pop singers, and an
occasional jazz show. Evalua-
tion: Breathtakingly beautiful and
ornate inside.

This looks like a good summer
for music; enjoy it!

The large two-ﬂoor bowling lane
will be converted into a split level
gallery, topped by a sculptural

the PPA membership is currently
holding a sale at the new building
with 1/3 off on the art pieces, the?

other 2/3 to be divided between the “

artists and the building fund.

Having gotten wind of the PPA
move, artist Phillip Rospek, decid-
ed to bargain for the storefront next

Lascola. But the old Geno's and
Pete’s pizza shop space was too
steep for Rospek to ﬁnance single

Lascola offered to join the venture
with profits shared.

Actually, Rospek does not expect
a windfall of proﬁts. He will open
shop around July 4 and let the

whole bag of off-Broadway pot-
pourri designed to add insight to
the playwright’s vision. But mean-
‘ings get muddled as the Lab
Theatre gets lost in its own slick
conventions.

Many of their projects are

ambitious and worth a passing

look. For those who have never
experienced experimental drama,
the Lab Theatre is located on the
corner of Fifth and Craft Avenues.
One of the most intersting
Pittsburgh theatre projects does
not have a premanent home. The
$.99 Floating Theatre operates out
of different theatre spaces scatter-
ed throughout the East End.
Under the auspices of Pitt
assistant professor of Theatre
Richard Mennen, the Floating
Theatre specializes in improvisa-
tional groups, mime artists, raga-
mufﬁm musicians and the like.
In the past year there has been a
great decline in thenumber of plays
(complete with playwrights) that

have been presented. Brecht’s

“The Measures Taken," perform-
ed by Shaliko, was one of the most
successful projects. The group
branched out into improvisation,
but a sound script survived.

The Floating Theatre has
brought some of the most unique
theatre to Pittsburgh. Unfortunate-
ly, many women’s theatre groups
have been overlooked in the past.
Maybe this season will reverse that
trend.

Black theatre has one persistant
voice in the city: the Kuntu
Repetory Theatre.

They produce several original
scripts, along with contemporary
works of black playwrights. Direct-
or Vernell Lillie is sensitive to the
issues surrounding black men. and
women. Her work is ﬁlled with
great compassion and beauty.

Currently, New York is trumpet-
ing the success of a 27-year-old
black poet/playwright, Ntozake
Shange. Her “For Colored Girls
Who Have Considered Suicide/
When the Rainbow is Enuf” is a
poectic and prosaic exploration of
black women. They have found a

', place on the New York stage. Can
the performance be repeated in ‘

Pittsburgh?

This sums up the most interest-
ing theatre outlets. Other universi-
ties, including Chatam, Duquesne,
Carlow and Point Park, have their
own theatre pickings. Usually, the
pickin’s are slim.

Pittsburgh lacks a strong
ﬁnancial backbone of support. IT is
in great need of this kind of energy

marquees and keep them burning.

that steadily and symbolically ticks

in‘ this otherwise unimaginative
production.

Some parts of the dialogue faith-
fully and . chillingly reﬂect the
central theme of Kafka’s novel.
Joseph K., upon being told of his
arrest, proclaims his innocence and
asks his guards what crime he is
accused of having committed. One
of his guardians inquires (not inap-
propriately) how K. can be sure of
his innocence if he does not know of
what he is accused.

The guard comments in depreca-
tion that the state has a difficult
task on its hands when it has to
deal with individuals who possess
such a feeble grasp of simple logic.

When we allow the state to
organize our lives we are in its_gr_ip.
The “authority” that has Joseph
K. in custody is not merely a cabal
of evil men; it is bureaucratic
power unchecked and taken to its
most efﬁcient pitch.

Some aspects of this play are
truly puzzling. The furniture and
artifacts are for the most part
late-Victorian but the clothes are
from 10 or 20 years ago; Joseph K.
has a recent copy of Playboy
magazine in his room. The guards
address their prisoner as “buddy”
and offer to‘ send out to the “diner”
for some breakfast.
reason why The Trial should not be
updated, or even why the events it

these discrepancies are indicative
of this production’s lack of any
coherent or consistent form.

blame for the disappointing impact

is a type of dance from Bulgaria;
“Cigany Tanc” means gypsy dance
in Hungarian; or “Wu Shih” is
what the Chinese call their dragon

Or did you know that “Diwda” is

”tinikling” is what the Phillipines

_ call their bamboo pole dance?

Did you know that the correct

is “Apfel Streudel," or that the
Irish call their scones “Bonnogai,”
while the Israelis call their
cheesecake “Ugat Gevina.” ' And
that the difference between a
Lebanese “Baklawa” and a Greek
“Baklava” is a matter of w’s and

Did you ever see the exquisite

Lithuanians, their Christmas trees
decorated with straw ornaments

Did you know that there “is” a

Epic Records PE 33849

Jeff Beck’s iiew release, Wired,
picks up where he left off on Blow
by Blow. Intense and funky, the
album captures the brilliance of
Beck.

Like Blow By Blow, it is all
instrumental and deeply rooted in
jazz. But this one shows clearly
that Beck is no longer searching for
a musical direction. He has found
the right formula for his music and
is now able to produce more
challenging material.

The addition of Jan Hammer
gives Beck’s music more depth.

Bar Entertainment 

BY LEE MOSES

Being a budding (if not already)_

alcoholic, I enjoy spending an
evening listening to a good band
playing good music in a good bar.
Naturally, I accepted this assign-
ment to review area bars and bands
with relish (and pickles, mustard,
etc.). Unfortunately, time and a

bad stomach prevented me from
checking out too many places so
you’ll only be reading about two
bars and three bands in this article.

Oakland St. between 5th "and
Forbes Avenues. Dominated by
caricatures of crazy people hanging

conjunctively after bar hours.

Wired begins with “Led Boots,”

a solid rocker with some explosive

percussion work by Narada Wal-
den. “Come Dancing” follows in
the rhythmic vein and features
some impressive interaction be-
tween Beck’s guitar and Hammer’s
synthesizer.

Beck is a technical wizard when
it comes to playing the guitar. He
constantly is experimenting with all
kinds of crazy electronic gadgets
and foot pedals. On “Goodbye
Park Pie Hat,” an old Charlie
Mingus tune, Beck shows off his
ability to create an endless array of
sounds with his guitar.’ This track

says Cook, who bought that famous
heritage line for $60. (Captain Cook

ness.”

Twelve years later, Cook doesn't
have much time to show off his
musical talent. Kept busy with the
register, he only grabs the
microphone for an unsuppressable
burst of song. Otherwise, it’s his
customers that unhook a guitar
from the wall and trail the
microphone cord to their table. (It's
not exactly singing for a meal,
though. The performers have to
consume a $2 minimum for their
,share of the spot-light.)

?*At the center of the breakfast and

lunch whirlwind activity, Captain
Cook is the perfect black bow-tied
master of ceremonies. He’s got
that fluid garrulousness that

naturally sparks jostlings among
the mealtime crowd. I've never
noticed a customer enter, eat and
go away without being engaged in
a brief banter by Cook.

The food? I have a suspicion it’s
not the menu that attracts his
lunchtime crowd. Usually, I stick to
their large-pot-of-coffee-for-a-
quarter special. The last time I had
their fresh‘-fruit cup, it took every

spoonful before I discovered that -

the small cubes of whitish-yellow
fruit was not pear, nor apple, but
unripened cantaloupe.

Still, no one minds. tWith Captain '

Cooke ready to entertain with
colorful stories of his life at the

‘drop of a hat, or indulge in the?

“How’s the wife? Kids? Pooch
have her puppies yet?” personable
routine, the craziness of the place
keeps you coming back for more.

As I'm leaving, Cook tells me to
end my article with a bang. “You
gotta tell them that I’m running for
mayor in '78. Against Coon and
Lynch. It won’t be announced
publicly until nextweek, but you
can have the scoop.”

So there you have it folks,
straight from the man’s mouth.

theatrics of the political arena.

plants, and the simplicity of their
ratan and cork furniture.

They plan a show a month and
welcome even art appreciators
iwthout a heavy billfold. The
entrance to their gallery is on
Winthrop a few feet from the Craig
Street corner. ,

These additions join the other

established artists and shops that_

make Craig Street the most
interesting potpourri of artistic
endeavor in the‘ city. Already,
Craig Street can boast of the
craftshop with the most variety of
items-——namely the 214 S. Craig
Earthworks Exchange——that fea-
tures any and all hand-made
articles. From home-sewn large
Raggedy Ann Dolls, to delicate
jewelry, earth pottery and home-
spun garments, they stock work of
local artists. _

Across the street and down a few
houses stands the studio of Virgil
Cantini, the artist who heads Pitt’s
Studio Arts department. Next to
him is the sober, London row
house-looking Vidmuk Company
Artists Supply shop.

walls, the place looks like the den

gzgof a proliﬁc mad cartoonist. Except.

"there is a massive bar.

Live entertainment is offered
almost every night. By paying the
dollar cover charge, I saw two
different bands on two different
nights. «

The’ ﬁrst band, D.C., is a
five-man group that does blues and
boogie. At their best they sound
like a 1970 British blues band; at
their worst they sound like a bunch
of twelve-year olds who had just
gotten their ﬁrst musical instru-
ment. Many people in the audience
like the harpist-ﬂoutist. Many

‘~ eople have no taste. The band
should be a foursome.

D.C. does do some nice stuff
especially a grufﬂy song, “Hallelu-
jah, How I Love Her So”, but
ridiculous flute usage spoiled
“Knock On Wood” and Aretha
Franklin’s “Since You Been
Gone.” Also. memorable was an
amazingly hokey “I Saw
Standing There” (to do this to a
Beatle tune should be a capital
offense) and a ﬁnale that reminded
me of a novice harpist backed of by
the N.Y. Dolls. Overall, with some
practice they could become compe-
tant. ’ ‘

Not so with the other band at
Peter's Pub, Uncle Sky. This group
is good. They dothe lighter rock
stuff from the Eagles, Michael
Franks, Todd Rundgren, Jesse
Colin Young, and Ace’s “How
Long” to a ‘drunkin cowboy’
closer. Especially good is their
extended version of Van Morri-

* son’s “Moondance.”

In short, Uncle Sky is one of the
best bar bands I have seen with
impeccable taste for music. But to
make it they must start writing
original material. Since they’re
tight and play well, have good
vocals; and do light rock well, they
should be able to write good music.

Before leaving Peter’s Pub, I

7"‘ should mention that I paid 50 cents
“ -‘ for a draft, 75 ‘cents for a bottle of -

Miller's, and $1.40 for a~mixed

 -drink:  shoiuld--alsc» mention .that:.-.1 - v

around midnight one night they ran
out of draft beer. The house
specialty is called a “stinger,’.’
which does. It consists of creme de
menthe and brandy and while it’s
worth’ it, I’m not switchng from
screwdrivers and rusty nails.

I wouldn’t advise ordering mixed
drinks in Walsh’s. It is a classic
honky—tonk bar located in the East
Liberty mall about ten minutes
from the Pitt campus. The top floor
of the bar is typical working class
bar, but on Friday and Saturday
nights go downstairs, pay no cover

(don’t dress nice) and order
yourself a draft (40 cents) or a $2.50
pitcher. Then sit back andenjoy
The Dixie Travelers.

These are just a fewgplaces to go
for some entertainment. There are
many other‘ places nearby: The
Decade, Sunny Daye’s and The
Portfolio in Oakland. Zelda’s
Greenhouse is .disco, also in
Oakland, the Encore II in Shady-
side. The Encore I, The Grog Shop,

a few. Explore and enjoy.

,4,i.',- At that time, the Student Government Board (SGB) was planning to

recommend to the Allocations Committee that funds for the club be cut
in half or down to 25% of their total operating budget.

But a turn of events has taken place, as the icers were allocated ‘

$8,310.76, or approximately one-half of the money needed to have a
ﬁscally successful season. After weeks of meetings with the SGB, the
club will be operating next season with $2,000 more than they had last

With the total predicted expenses for the upcoming season set at
$17,000 (for a 26-game schedule—14 home and 12 away, -three
‘practices per week and ﬁve road trips), the Hockey Club is still facing
its annual uphill climb to the ﬁrst face-off. After adding the Student
Government allocation and the predicted income from ticket sales and
player dues ($30 initiation plus $7 per month), the icemen will still be
left with an approximate $4,000 deficit, which they will have to collect

gem other avenues working with the athletic department, or else they
‘will be forced to make cuts in thebudget, which would mean cutting
- the schedule. ‘ - s

The club has eliminated, fund-raising activities, unless a player
wishes to raise money that way in place of his dues. The compiliation
of another ad book to raise funds is tentatively on the agenda. An
increased non-player membership is also expected to get the club‘ on its
feet. ' . '

The players, no doubt, are some of the most loyal athletes on the Pitt
campus. Not only do they furnish their own equipment and
transportation to and from games and practices, but the icers are often

also called upon to dig a little deeper into their already-stretched

pockets to help out the club during crises. .

Aside from a few shaky moments, the Hockey Club has proven it can
survive and, undoubtedly, that -it can ‘compete against tough
competition on the club level. ' ~~ e—-  ~--

One disappointing factor regarding the club is the lack of ‘fan
support. The Civic Arena crowds can be called two things—small or

g‘ sparse. As head coach Len Barcalow often says, “It’s standing room

only today. Yeah, I saw about eight or nine people standing around.”
Not even a load of freebees, delivered when the Panthers lost a
“Guaranteed Win Day” contest to Duquesne and were forced to let
ticket-holders in free for the next home game, could pack (Section A, at
least) people into the Arena. '

With the Penguins, those artists of the big playoff choke, charging
exorbitant prices, it is more than worthwhile to invest a buck or so in a
Pitt hockey game and see just the right mixture of skating and
shooting, gracefulness and toughness, that makes the icers a winning
team. Sure the Panthers lose their cool once in a while, but just ask any
National Hockey League team’s ticket manager what draws the
crowds, or ask the Philadelphia Flyers how they won back-to-back
Stanley Cups. <

The SGB and the Allocations Committee should be lauded for their

 ecision to" keep the Hockey Club alive. And ﬁve years from‘ now, with
_ -‘-. he building of a’ new sports complex and an eventual varsity hockey

program. this action will reap many rewards.

BY TOM HALL

There was an article in Time
magazine about two years ago
describing the effect anew and

     

S enthusiastic young, college football

head coach has had on a
deteriorating football program at a
major university. C

Pitt’s program had a long
tradition of winning ways, until
recently, when the decline became
evident by the team’s ‘1-10 record
in 1972.

Theadministration decided that
it was time for a ‘ ‘major change” in
the Pitt Panther football program.
It was then that they decided to
lure a young head coach, a near

“miracle man?’ from his job at Iowa
State and give him a challenge that
might rival climbing Mt. Everest.

To turn around a football progrm
in one year was asking too much.

“Just win us a game or two. Don’t
let the Panthers go through another
1-10 year,” Pitt’s followers told
their new leader. ‘

Well, others had tried and failed.

So in came this southern
gentleman who had a ﬂashy smile,
a way with his kids and a new and
refreshing attitude.

.It’s been done before, right?

In his debute at the Panther
helm, Johnny Majors gave Panther
fans the faith. Traveling south for
the opening game of the 1973
season against “the time-tested
Georgia Bulldogs, Majors and his
squad were immediately posted
14-point underdogs. -

But keep the faith. The defense
didn’t melt under the ferocious
Georgia sun and the Panthers came
away with a 7-7 tie.

The cinderella team of the NCAA
went 6-4-1 that year and gained a
Fiesta Bowl berth, the first
post-season invitation in decades
for a Pitt team.

That Time article two years ago
‘quoted this brash young coach from
Tennessee as saying, “Our goal is
to bring a national championship to
Pitt within two or three years.” It
is ' a case of a self-fulfilling
prophecy. If you believe, then your
goals are limitless.

 

it

 

Now, in his furth year as Panther
coach Majors’ time is more than
ripe to let that prophecy come true.
“We’re not in a position to be
number one as yet,” he said a
month ago as his squad rounded
out their spring drills. “That we
are a top-ten caliber team is more
acceptable. ’ ’

To call a team that returns an

’ overwhelming 18 of 22 starters

from an 8-4 year, even though it
will be pitted against some of the
toughest competition in the coun-
try, including national champ
Oklahoma, “possible” Top-ten
caliber seems almost ludicrous.

This year, the Panthers are for
real.

Again the competition doesn’t
come cheap. Notre Dame starts off
the schedule, and the Fighting
Irish are going to be out for blood
after last year’s 34-20 thrashing, a
loss that cost them a spot in the
Cotton Bowl.

isited

on the ground. The superlatives

everyone came up with just didn’t ‘

seem to ﬁt just right. With a
couple of passes under his belt,
Dorsett ravaged the Irish for 374’
total yards, and the Panthers came
away with the most impressive win
in Major’s three-year stay. ’

But to say that “T.D” is the

Panther football team is absurd as.

well.

This year’s crop of graduating
seniors are Major’s ﬁrst recruits at
Pitt. Many of them have played
regularly since they were fresh-
man, so experience is no problem.
The defensive powerhouse Majors

- and his staff have built at Pitt is not

about to embarrass them in their
ﬁnal season.

Last year’s defensive unit was at
least consistent, and often times,
no less than awesome.

The defense limited its oppo-
nents to just 13.4 points per game
last year, including three shutouts.

It was perhaps that contest more
than any other that has shown the
Pitt fans that indeed the Panther
effort has come of age.

' One of the most formidable
runners in collegiate history lived

nation last year. Matt Cavanaugh was given a starting role last year
and performed quite capably when starter. Robert ‘Haygood became

The Solvay, N.Y. native is up for

  lt’s Almost ‘Next Year’pfor Grgurich

BY CRIS HALL

Pitt basketball coach Tim
Grgurich found himself in a tough
position after Buzz Ridl resigned as
head coach before last season.

He was succeeding a likeable
man (Ridl was perhaps one of a
dying breed—a college basketball
coach who remained honest to the
end) who had turned the Pitt
program around in his seven years
at the helm.

Pitt was 4-20 in Ridl’s first
season as Panther coach, but Ridl’s
last two editions of the Blue and
Gold took post-season trips to the

‘ma ..

    



NCAA in 1973 and the NIT in 1974.

And Ridl did all that without
making any enemies-at least none
at Pitt. He left on good terms with
everyone involved to become
nearby Westminster College’s al-
umni director.

So Grgurich was down one strike
before he came to bat—there was
already a successful predecessor to
compare him with. All Grgurich
had to do was keep Ridl’s program
aﬂoat, right? A

But that was not all Tim Grgurich
was to be faced with. Grgurich, a
dynamic, young aggressive coach
with new blood to inject into the

Pitt basketball fans have spent much of this offseason lamenting last
year’s 12-15 record, but head coach Tim Grgurich has been occupied
with more constructive efforts. Experienced returnees and talented
newcomers should help make this year’s tough slate easier to face_

program, met three more low blows
before he got a chance to swing.
First, sophomore-to-be center Mel
Bennett was drafted by the ABA
Virginia Squires in the first round
of the college draft and signed with
that same club.

Grgurich, however, was not
crying—he still had a trio of
all-East candidates, Tom Richards,
Keith Starr and Larry Harris,
coming back, didn’t he?

He did, but not for long.

The ﬁrst to fall-—literally‘-—was
Starr. One of the few athletes
whose last names describe them,
Keith, a 6-7 guard-forward, could

“do it all.” During his junior year, _

Starr scored more than 13 points
per game, shot 47% from the floor,
averaged almost seven rebounds
per game, had- a team-high 114
steal and a Pitt-record 180 assists.

Keith Starr was a great cure for
any insomnia Grgurich might
suffer, at least until aseason-open-
ing game with the Yugoslavian
national team. After that, he was
just one of several headaches for
the first-year coach.

Starr injured his right knee while
attempting a lay-up and, as a
result, his senior season consisted
of one missed shot against Notre
Dame. '

Still, Keith showed enough
potential to cause the NBA Chicago
Bulls to make him the first player

.   .. _ M
One thing Grgurich won’t be able to count on is this quartet of

drafted in the fourth round of this
year's draft.

Keith will probably return to Pitt
to play his (second) senior season,
since he said he won't sign a
contract unless it is no-cut, the

Bulls said they don’t even want to ‘

talk to him yet, and he is likely to
be picked higher next year should
his senior year be nearly as good as
it should be. But that didn’t help
Tim Grgurich much last year.

Tom Richards, 21 six-foot shoot-
ing guard who was one of the best
shots in the East and a three-year
starter, broke a bone in his
shooting wrist a couple of days
later during practice. Tom was a
game team leader, however, and
came back before anyone thought it
possible. He gave it all he had, and
then some, but he just wasn’t the
same old Tom. Grgurich, by this
time, had every right to complain,
or at least’ be a little bit depressed,
but he continued, it seemed, to look
forward to the season.

' The season’s first game, West
Virginia Wesleyan at the Field
House, went well enough. A
nine-point win. Maybe Grgurich
knew something I didn’t. I now

This year, things look even
better for Grgurich than they did
last year at this time. His second

benefits of the disappointing
season was that many returning
players saw lots of playing time.

much playing time as was

physically possible no matter what
team he played on. Lorain, Ohio’s
pride and joy, scored more than 22
points per game while setting a Pitt
record for points scored by a
sophomore. Harris also led the
team in rebounding and shot better
than 50% from the floor. Harris’
natural ability causes his freedom
from injury to be one of Grgurich’s
prized possessions.

-Another. junior who beneﬁtted
from last year’s playing time was
6-5 guard-forward Terry Knight,
the only Panther to see action in all
27 games. Knight's improvement
was noticeable as the season wore
on, and he ﬁnished with an average
- i ,5.9 points per game.

 Senior guard Frank Boyd, a 6-1,
185-pounder from Pittsburgh’s
Peabody High School, will also put
in a qualiﬁed bid for playing time,
mainly on the basis of his defensive
abilities. Boyd is not one of the
team’s bettershooters, but he did
manage to hand off the team’s
third-highest amount of assists in

Haygood won’t be in contention
for a starting position, but should
see more and more action as the
season develops if he does, in fact,
play for Grgurich. Don’t be
surprised if he doesn’t.

Grgurich will have a lot of talent
returning for this season, but he
was not one to sit tight, for at least
two reasons. First, he’s not that
kind of guy—young and dynamic,’
remember?" He's a good recruiter
who knows how to make best use of
his talents. '

Not only that, but he remember-
ed what had happened the previous
year, and was not about to take any
chances. He was probably deter-
mined to have in fold enough
quality players to be able .to
withstand unexpected setbacks. If
so, his recruiting crop must have
satisﬁed him.

Michael Rice was the ﬁrst to
head Pitt-ward. A 6-8, 215-pounder
from Frederick, Md., Rice aver-
aged 28.7 points and 15 rebounds
per game a a ﬁrst’-team all-state

' strong foreward in high school. He

was also the first member of a
Dapper Dan Roundball Classic
United States all-star team to select
Pitt. Coach Grgurich, was, it
seemed, coming out ahead for a
chance. .

The signing of Nathan .“Sonny”
Lewis, a "product of nearby
Schenley High, made it two in a
row for Grgurich. After averaging

22 points and 12 rebounds at_
Schenley, Lewis was named all-_
' city, all-state and all-America.

A 6-3 guard ‘modeled after
Williams, a teammate on Schen-

' _ley'sAstate championship team of
- two years ago, Lewis gave Pitt fans

_notice of what they could expect in
November when he was named the
PA. all stars’ "MVP, in the
Roundball Classic.

The signing_of Lewis and.Rice

might have been enough for most -
A coaches, but.not for Grgurich. Last
year’s disappointments were too_

fresh infhis mind. He had to have
more, and he got it in the person of
a 6-11 all-America center from
suburban Baldwin High School. Ed
Scheuermann gave Grgurich more
insurance than he’ll need when he
opted for Pitt. ' V .
Scheuermann averaged 25 points
and 12 rebounds per game last
year, drawing college offers from
more schools than the Panthers will
play in the next ten years. A
member of the Pennsylvania
all-stars‘, -Scheuermann became the
third Roundball Classic participant
to sign with Grgurich.
' An added bonus for
program came when David Wash-

 

‘Pitt ’ s

ington, a 5-10 point guard from
Florida's Gulf Coast Junior College
and Detroit, Michigan, decided
he'd spend his sophomore year as a
Panther. Anyone who averaged
more than eight assists per game
and scored in double ﬁgures in
high school and junior college ball
could expect a welcome from
Grgurich.

Yet another break came when

Give Larry Harris the ball and
chances are he’ll plut it in the hoop.
Harris scored more points than any
sophomore in Pitt history last year
and is looking forward to an
all-American season.

sophomore Kelvin Smith, a 6-11
center from Schenley who was
forced to sit out his freshman year
because of academic deﬁciencies,
received a winter-term report
which was good enough to remove
him from academic ineligibility.
Smith won’t start nextlyear, but
he'll play. .

What’s this? Could it be possible
that, after spending more than a
few years as one of the best and
brightest assistant coaches in the
country relatively unnoticed in
Buzz Ridl’s shadow, and ‘after

seeing his chance to run his own ‘

ship spoiled by desertion, injuries
and inexperience, Tim Grgurich
was about to get his chance to show
what he could do?

Maybe.

Just what Grgurich could do was
shown when Pittsburgh's basket-

ball writers named him their coach -

of the year, despite the disappoint-
ing season his team had gone
through.

...But He's Not Counting His‘Panthers Yet...

But just because everything
looks great now doesn’t mean
Grgurich will spend next summer
deciding where to put his NCAA
trophy.

More than enough things will be
present to prevent his having to
solve that problem, but it does
seem possible Pitt could “make a
strong run at the Top 20 teams in
America," as Grgurich puts it.

One thing Grgurich is up
against is a very tough schedule.
Pitt will entertain Virginia, Rut-
gers, West Virginia, Cincinnati,
Massachusetts and Duquesne next
season, and will face among others
Southern California, New Mexico,
George Washington, Syracuse,
West Virginia,
Duquesne and Maryland on the

» road.

Pitt will participate in" three
tournaments: the Steel Bowl, with
Duquesne, Hofstra and Southern
Illinois; the Lobo Tournament, with

 Iowa, New Mexico and Southern,

Cal, and the East Indies Tourna-
ment, a three-day affair in which
Pitt will be one of eight Eastern
independents battling for an
automatic NCAA berth.

Pitt is in the Western division of
the recently formed Eastern
Intercollegiate Basketball League
(EIBL), which will host its ﬁrst
post-season tournament during the
ﬁrst week of next March. The
Panthers have been placed’ in the
EIBL Western Division, along with
Duquesne, West Virginia and Penn
State. The Eastern Division’s
member schools are Rutgers,

George ‘Washington,
setts and Villanova.

Massachu-

Pitt will face Duquesne three
times, Penn State and. West
Virginia twice and Eastern Division
school once during the regular
season. Seedings for the post-sea-
son will be based on intraleague
records. ‘

One beneﬁt the EIBL will offer
Pitt fans is the opportunity to see
the Panthers «play Duquesne as
many as four times, depending on
pairings in the Steel Bowl and East
Indies tournaments. One of those
games will be played at the Field‘
House February 12. That alone is
enough to cause most Panthers
fans to wish the new league well.

Just how serious a bid the
Panthers will make for the EIBL

"championship will be discernable
well in advance of March, however.
Tim Grgurich and his assistants,
Fran Webster and Bob Hill, will
have a good idea of what to look
forward too even earlier than that.

In fact, Tim Grgurich will be
walking around with a broad smile
if he can just make it to the Field
House November 27 for a season-
opening date with West Virginia
Wesleyan joined by a semi-healthy
ballclub.

And if he is, it will be Grgurich’s
turn to watch other coaches worry,
wonder and despair, endeavoring
to maintain an amiable exterior
while privately wishing for toma-
does at gametime.

And Tim Grgurich could smile all t

the way to some post-season

worries, which he wouldn't mind a

FRESHMEN

With your college career completely ahead of you, there is one question that we would like you

to consider now: What do you want to do after graduation?

Unless you are independently wealthy, you probably consider college as a means of preparing for {
your chosen career, but have you ever examined the job market? College is only part of the preparation
that you will need. It seems that most employers are looking for a bachelors__or masters degree andthree to
five years of experience. In order to have three to five years of experience, someone must hire" you for a

entry level position.

Trodding down a scenic path is the Pitt cross

meets, including an upset of nationally ranked Penn

BY TOM HALL

Panther head swimming coach
Dick Bradshaw has worked hard all
year long. Right now, he’s'in sunny
southern California, with competi-
tive swimming and his Pitt tankers
the farthest thing from his mind.

Well, not exactly. Bradshaw’s
position may entail junkets to Long

yégelach, California, but once again,
A "as most things are for Bradshaw,
it’s all business. _

Bradshaw has accepted the
challenge of herding ﬁve Pitts-
burgh youths to the‘Belmont Plaza
pool for the United States Olympic
swimming trials which will wind
up today.

"The ﬁve talented swimmers
include freshman sensation Kathy
Stetler, only the second female
ever to receive all-America honors
at Pitt, Jerry ‘DeMuro, the Panther
swim team’s most valuable swim-
mer last year, and Jan Ujevich,

,;3%tIrie Potter and Nancy Henry,
“focal high school students and
members of the Pitt Aquatic Club.

“We're really excited about the
trials,” said Bradshaw at his
departure. “It’s the ﬁrst time this
large a group from Pittsburgh is
going, and it’s a good situation to
be in. lt’s a team spirit-type thing,
with ﬁve of us to cheer each other

On."

Stetler, who swam in the
Belmont last year for the world
trials, gained national recognition
as one of the top freshman in the
country at last winter’s AIAW
nationals, where she was awarded
all-America honors.

DeMuro as well is no stranger to
- competitive swimming. He was
.’undefeated last season in both the
1000- and 1500-yard swims for

Bradshaw’s tankers.

In a superlative effort, DeMuro
successfully defended his titles in
the Eastern Intercollegiate Swim-
ming and Diving Invitationals, held
this year at Penn State. For his
efforts, he was named the Invite’s
most valuable swimmer, as the
Panthers won the team title handily
over East Carolina.

Bradshaw has been at Pitt for
ﬁve years now, and after a setback
in his ﬁrst year as mentor has

;‘g)sted for consecutive winning

‘seasons. Last year, the Cats
ﬁnished the year with an impres-

sive 10-1, record, their only loss a 0

.I'

 

State;

one-point decision to nationally
ranked Ohio State.

This was the year, Bradshaw
stated ﬂatly in the preseason, that
the second places the tankers have
been taking in the past just
wouldn’t do.

He set three goals for the Cats.
“First,” he said, “we’re out to
better last year’s dual meet record
of 8-2. Secondly, we’re out to win
the Penn State relays. (Last year
the Panthers finished second
behind Maryland.) And ﬁnally, we
will win the Eastern crown.” _

With those goals accomplished,
it’s time for Bradshaw and his
charges to look toward national,
and perhaps even international
recognition. - -

The,United States has always
been a big winner in the swimming
events at the Olympic games, and
it will be a long uphill battle for any
of the ﬁve to make the Olympic
team. The Panthers have I two
Olympian swimmers presently on

their roster, however. Pitt letter-

winners Orlando Catinchi and
all-American Angie Lopez are on
their way to Montreal as part of the
delegation representing Puerto
Rico. / I

But the swimmers will all agree
that it’s Bradshaw who deserves a
lion’s share ofthe acclaim. “ Coach
Bradshaw is the greatest,” said
Stetler. _“I don’t know ifI’d even be
swimming right now if it wasn’t for

The Panther barriers finished 24th in the
NCAA championships.

 Area Swimmers Hopeful

him. He really knows how to
motivate his people, and no matter
how busy he is, he always has time
to talk to you. That’s important ot
me, too.” i

Just as Bradshaw is respected by
his swimmers, he and his charges
are rapidly gaining the respect of
their opponents, although a sport
like swimming doesn’t receive the
accolades sports like fooball and
basketball do.

But this year is different, as are
every fourth year when the
Olympics roll around, and swim-
mers, tracksters and a host of other
get some recognition from the
media.

This recognition, however, is not
the aim of a man like Bradshaw,
even though it’s coming in swarms.
Bradshaw was recently designated
as a “two-star coach” for 1977,
which will make him available for
coaching duties on an international
level. ’

Again this year, the swimmers
posted the best record of any
varsity sport in the University.
Again this year, they have received
little recognition for the efforts.

The Panther. swimmers are,
however, student athletes, among
the ﬁnest athletes on campus bar
none, who are not only a credit to
the university, but are rapidly
becoming a credit to their sport.

Earl “Bud” Cooper was third in
the 440-yard dash in the WPIAL

Agostinella feels he may also be
useful in patching up some of the
Panthers’ relay teams. Cooper was

Pantherettes Leap Into

Power-Packed Schedulg

BY TOM HALL

No longer are women’s sports
a fad. They are for real, and the
growing concern over women’s
athletics at Pitt is mirrored by the
newly announced Pantherette bas-
ketball schedule.

After a rocky start last season,
which saw the team working ‘under
a new head coach, the women’s
basketball team compiled a 16-8

record. Now in her. second year at-

the helm, Pat Wallace has an-
nounced that one of the nation’s
basketball powers, Immaculata,
has been added to next year’s
slate. '

"Another top power in women’s
basketball, the University of
Maryland, will grace next year’s
program, making the Pantherette
schedule one of the most demand-
ing in ‘the ‘country. ‘

“We’re very excited about the
new schedule,” Wallace said..
“It’s a great schedule. We really
don’t have one easy contest—and
the Mississippi Invitational will
include some of the biggest powers
in the south, so we’re in for quite a

year.”
In mid-December, the Panther-

ettes will travel south for the

Mississippi Invitational Tourna-
ment, won last year by newly
crowned national champion Delta
State. Also in December, the
Pantherettes will host the annual
Pitt Invitational. With the East
coast the home of many of the
women’s basketball powerhouses,

the Pitt Invitational always matches '

some of the strongest teams in the
country.

“We are situated in the

strongest region in the nationffvﬁ
women’s basketball,” Wallace

said. “The top teams in the
country have consistently come

I from our area and there are lots of

good teams here, so there is
quantity as well as quality
competition on our schedule.”

Wallace led her Pantherettes to a
'16-8 mark last season, and Pitt
ended the year as consolation
champions of the EAIAW Mid-
Atlantic region.

“Our staff~ and players are very
excited about our new, big-time
schedule for the upcoming sea-
son,” Wallace said. “With a

schedule like this, now regior1,a___L\._
and perhaps even national recog‘-212.4?"

tion can’t overlook us. ”

" Greatseason Expected

, the Panthers should be even more

explosive than ever. ‘
The offensive line began to jell

' last season, and the gaping holes

left in the‘o'pposit'ion”s defensive
line appear as numbers on
Dorsett’s, Elliott Walker’s, and
quarterback Robert Haygo_od’s
statistics. Both John Hanhauser

and Tom Brzozalmade the Associa- .
‘ ted Press honorable mention all-

America team.

Matt Carroll started at offensive
guard last year as a freshman and
should be vastly improved. Throw
in veteran stalwart'Joe Stone at
tackle and John Pelusi at center,
and you come up with a strong,
hardnosed unit that promises to
send Dorsett on his way to the
Heisman Trophy, and the Panthers
to another bowl appearance.

Playing all-purpose tight end Jim

Corbett is like having another‘

offensive lineman. But don’t sell
him short as a pass-catching tight
end, either. He led the team with
24 receptions last season, was
named to the all-East team _by both
wire services, and made the AP

all-American honorable mention
squad.

Karl Farmer, the senior split end
with the world-class sprinter
statistics, was injured most of last
season. This gave way to the rise of

and the ever-amazing Gordon
Jones.

Jones, another freshman starter b

on last year’s unit, ﬁnished sixth in
the NCAA in punt returns.‘ On punt
returns against Notre Dame and
Syracuselast season, Jones dem-
onstrated an uncanny ability to

-wriggle‘ away again and again. He

was nothing short of electrifying. In
this year’s set-up, Majors may
bring back the wingback, a new
wrinkle to the veer offense. Give
Jones the ball ﬁve times a game,

. and he could end the season with

1,000 yards.

The backﬁeld remains intact
from last year’s devastating attack.
Along with Dorsett, Walker pro-
vices the second half of the most
dynamite one-two punch in college
football. Walker finished last‘

. season with 900' yards rushing and

an impressive 5.6-yard average.
It takes a capable quarterback,

intelligent and quick to react, to

run a veer offense. The panthers

‘don’t have one—they have two.

F

Senior Robert Haygood will
return after a stint with the
basketball team for a ﬁnal season

on the gridiron. His performance in
the Panthers’ 33-19 win over
Kansas in the Sun Bowl netted him
the award for the most valuable

offensive player." The six-footer

from Atlanta has become more and ,
more comfortable in,his handling 
the veer. In the Sun Bowl, he,“

Dorsett, and Walker each accumu-
lated more than 100 yards rushing.
to Navy,

In the 17-0 loss

. Haygood was racked up for the rest

of the regular season, and the
duties fell to junior Matt Cavan-
augh. In his ﬁrst start in a Panther
uniform, Cavanaugh proved worthy
to the challenge, pasting Syracuse
for 38 points, including three

touchdown passes.

The quarterback situation is still
up in the air, and will probakpl-:\_
remain that way until game time 
September 11, when an ABC
television audience will decide just
how far the 1976 Panthers will go.

And after the Sun Bowl

performance last December...the

sky’s the limit.

Although LD may seem like a

LD hasn’t taken’ ’

has other plans.
his annual two-week vacation for
the past six years. He’s saving it
for severance pay--to have the
money to move. The dream of
research and teaching just has to
become a reality. LD’s head may
be hidden in the mist of poetry, but
his feet are planted" uncomfortably
on the orange-and-brown Student
Union carpets.

But the mood passes, and the
frustrations press in again. He
knows he’s still here checking
doors and IDs and cash registers,
pacing the building from 4 to 13:5.‘
Monday through Friday and right‘
now there’s nothing promising in
the ofﬁng. The phone rings
clamorously.

“Yes?...Oh, dad gum it, that’s
right. I’ll go up and check on that
right away. Right.” He places his
list of House Manager’s duties
carefully in a leather folder, and
stalks out of the office to do his job.
