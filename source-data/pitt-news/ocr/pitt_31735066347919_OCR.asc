Chesley Cleared Of
All But One Count

Va

Sophomore Al Chesley was freed
of all but one drug-related charge
facing him at a city court hearing
last week, but the 19-year-old
linebacker won ’t know whether he’s
back on the Panther football team
until after he goes before a campus
judicial board.

Chesley, arrested in Tower C
June 70 and charged with various
drug counts, resisting arrest and
tampering with evidence, was
cleared of all charges except one-—
possession of marijuana. He
reportedly will participate in a
rehabilitation program instead of
facing trial.

But football coach Jackie Sherrill,

      
 

who suspended Chesley “pending
completion of all legal aspects of the
case,” has said he will not make a
decision on reinstating the Wash-
ington, D.C. native until Chesley’s
case is heard by a campus student
judicial board. The case was to have

been heard yesterday, but was‘

postponed when Chesley’s lawyer
and a witness could not attend.
Chesley campus charges involve
drug possession, throwing objects
from a dormitory window and
failure to control a guest. The
hearing could be rescheduled
before the end of the week.
Sherrill apparently will not

Smaller Fall Concerts Slated

By DEANNA LOUISE

Campus concerts will be smaller
and Pitt programming more di-
versified during L the upcoming
academic year. according to Stu-
dent Government Board member
Dave Hesidence. I

Only concertscosting less than
$13,000 will be‘ staged in small-
crowd capacity‘ "locales in the
Student Union and David Lawrence
Hall. Hesidence said.

The price ceiling on concert
expenditures eliminates Student
Government-sponsored concerts in
the Syria Mosque. where total costs
start at $13,000.

“Over the past three years
programming came close to ﬁlling
the Mosque once." Hesidence
said. “Usually we lose money on
large concerts.” -

Funds for five fall term concerts
have already been approved.
These are a day in the park. a jazz
seminar. the homecoming concert.
a blues show and a lower lounge
concert.

The approval of winter term

concerts pends the passage of

newly drawn programming by-
laws, which institute a Calendar
Committee to arrange the date,
time and place for all concerts,
including those scheduled by other
campus organizations.

These by-laws also ofﬁcialize the
establishment of a Cultural Events
sub-committee run by the Student
Union Board. To satisfy the needs
of Pitt's diverse audience, this
sub-committee programs presenta-
tions of theater, dance. classical
music. art and poetry.

* Sharon Johnson Trial Ends



-J

By BETSY NORMAN

Final summations in the Sharon
Johnson Title VII sex discrimination
non-jury trial were heard by US
Circuit Court Judge William Knox
yesterday.

The court's decision in the case,
which has lasted 'for nearly six
years, is expected in several
months.

Johnson, a Pitt bio-chemistry
professor, was denied tenure in
1971 and charged the University
with sex discrimination. She
appealed the tenure denial through
all of the internal channels available
to her, including the Aﬁrmative
Action committee, the Senate
Academic Freedom and Tenure
Committee and personal meetings
with the Dean of the School of
Medicine.

The University Senate committee
said, according to Johnson, the
University followed due process in
denying her tenure, but the
committee also found evidence of
sex discrimination and harrass-
ment. The evidence was based
upon the simultaneous cancelation
of another woman’s contract and
the promotion of three men,
Johnson said.

After months of attempting to
schedule a meeting with the
Chancellor, Johnson ﬁled a com-
plaint with the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission (EEOC) in
Washington. The EEOC, according
to Johnson, suggested the Univer-
sity settle out of court, as they found
cause for back payment and tenure.

The University refused to settle and
in 1973 Johnson ﬁled suit under the
Civil Rights Act of 1963 and Title
VII.

In May of 1973, Knox handed
down an injunction allowing
Johnson to continue with her job at
the University throughout the
duration of her trial.

Conference Ends  

In Dispute  

By BETSY NORMAN

Womankind, Penns_vlvania’s
three-day conference on women’s
rights, ended Sunday amid charges
of militancy, chauvinism and
radicalism. ,

Members of the U.S. Coalition for
Life charged the International
Women’s Year Commission, the
federal governing body of the state
conference, with being representa-
tive of the militant feminist
positions and having no intention of
allowing equal opportunity to
groups supporting anti-abortion or
anti-Equal Rights Amendment
(ERA). ideas. V

1

An overwhelming majority of the
3,700 conference participants voted
to support a plan of action calling for
equal rights for gays and abortion
on demand.

The conference also supported
ratification of the ERA.

Other reforms advocated at the
conference included: decriminali-
zation of prostitution; reform of
Pennsylvania’s divorce act to
include strong economic protection
for dependent spouses; vigorous
enforcement of the Equal Credit
Opportunity Act and support for
feminist credit unions; repeal of all
laws regulating sexual relations

The Concert and Lecture Com-
mittees will continue to program
contemporary music and speakers
respectively.

To date. Bobbi Prince and Bobbi
Riggs. Alex Haley and Floresch,

lecture during the fall term.

Pitt Police Pull Reign
on Nighttime Ticketing

Campus police have been issued
a directive that will make it harder
for them to ticket illegally parked
cars: at night and on weekends
because, police say, the local
magistrate is unable to process the
number of tickets issued by officers
recently.

According to a lieutenant on the
campus squad, officers are required
to “check with the station before
issuing a citation” until Oakland
magistrate Nicholas Diulus, who
police say is “backed up,” is again
able to process tickets during the
period required by law.

“It's only a temporary thing,”
the lieutenant said. “We’re being a
little lax during times traffic is not
so heavy. But we will continue to
tag ﬂagrant violators.

“The magistrate has only so
many days to processacitation or it
is no good by law,” he added, “and
until he can get to where he can, the
officers are going to be taking it
easier.”

At least some officers, however,
interpreted the directive as mean-
ing they should refrain from‘ all
ticketing on campus after 6 p.m.
and on weekends. “We’re not
supposed to do any ticketing. after
six,” one officer said. “The
magistrate hasn’t been able to keep
up, so we’re supposed to lay off for a
while.” i

‘ ‘It’s crazy, ” another officer said.
“The magistrate falls behind, so we
have to look the other way unless
someone is blocking Fifth Avenue
with a train. The problem is there
aren’t enough parking places here
for police cars, let alone commuters
and staff.”

A station spokesman, however,
cautioned last night that the
“laxity” will be in effect temporar-
ily, and that a motorist whose
parking hampers trafﬁc or Univer-
sity operations will ﬁnd himself in
possession of the familiar $25 tag.

Construction, which began this month, of a 450-space parking garage at the
corner of Forbes and Semple will continue into 1978 using $2.3 million from
the Federal Construction Fund. ‘The L-shaped parking garage, to be built by
the Pittsburgh Parking Authority, will be built around the present Parkvale .

Savings building.

research into safe and effective
contraception for sexually active
teenagers.

Also supported at theconference
were: national and international
attention to the problems of
minority groups; comprehensive
national child-care legislation; ex-
tensive new provisions for women's
health care, including research on
diseases affecting women and
improved access for women to the
entire health care system; and
nationwide passage of the Uniform
Child Custody Act and court
arrangements for joint or split
custody of children.

All these recommendations are
contained in a Pennsylvania plan of

delegates and 5 alternates elected
to attend the November national
women’s conference in Houston.

One of the main features of the
conference was a keynote address

‘ ‘Beginning from infancy we have
been conditioned to be subservient
to men,” Jordan said. “The
movement to liberate women was
and remains an inevitable and
continuing event. Those words,
‘equal justice under the law,’ are so
important that we chisel them on
the face of the Supreme Court
building. But this country is
uncomfortable with the idea of
equality.” 2

Jordan explained the situation of
women in the employment world as
an example of the sex discrimina-
tion in the U.S. and then said,
“What we must understand is that
part of the blame lies with us. Some
of us believe the myth that women
are not as competent as men. We
have been brainwashed by the

to succeed, our ﬁrst act must be to
win over other women who still

WASHINGTON (AP)—The
House voted yesterday to ‘put the
controversial B1 nuclear bomber
into production but President
Carter gave no hint whether his
decision Thursday will be to go
along with that.

The House also voted to cut 315
million off the Central Intelligence
Agency’s $35 million contingency
reserve fund in order to limit its
ability to fund covert operations
such as the Laos and Angola wars
without Congress’ approval.

HOUSE APPROVES NO-TAX
BUDGET

HARRISBURG (AP)—The
House approved a so-called no-tax
budget yesterday that is designed to

wind up in a legislative conference

committee where new taxes are
expected to be added.

After two months of budget
preparation and six days of
marathon debates, the House
wound up approving the same
budget the Senate had passed in
April. V

Although both chambers have
passed a budget, the bill isn’t ready
for Gov. Shapp’s signature because
a joint House-Senate conference
committee now must work out a
compromise acceptable to both
chambers.

Majority leader James Mander-
ino said it was the only way to get
the budget passed before the ﬁscal
year ends at midnight Thursday.

"7 I Year: of Collegiate Journalism at the University of Pittsburyr"

  Wait ‘til September

The Student Government Board's recent decision to wait until
September before choosing resigned member Ahinie Baum’s
replacement was a welcome and sane move that can only lead to a
better choice.

Instead of selecting a successor from a_ scant list of student ap-
plicants who happened to hear of the vacancy over the summer, the
board will allow each student to have a chance to apply for Baum’s
seat. Only four students have applied thus far, one being Michael
-Bates, who was ruled off last winter’s ballot after missing a pre-
election deadline. , -

. These candidates’ interest, we hope, will be taken into con-
sideration in September, but there must be more than a quartet of

, students hoping to become SGB members without going through
an election. The temptation to cast this matter aside quickly by' . V ,

choosing a summer applicant must have been strong, but the wai
can only yield benefits to the board and its constituency.

Another Study

With the recent. announcement of still another study of
Oakland’s many problems comes the realization these undertakings
have become as frequent——and fruitless—-—as the annual attempts to
stall a tuition increase.

The most recent plan is ambitious in its effort to analyze and
solve such problems as land use, parking, University expansion and,
the problems created by fast-food and bar crowds. But we fear that
no matter how ‘much effort is put into this plan by the supporting
groups it will, like its predecessors, yield no real progress for
several reasons.

The format is a good one, with public discussions involving
citizen, University and business representatives aimed at setting
immediate and long—range goals to the various problems." But,
given the attitudes and positions of the combatants, it is probable
this project is doomed to be a “nice try.” ,

The various citizen groups are so opposed to Pitt they refuse to
.consider even intelligent and beneficial University projects, such as
the recent townhouse proposal. And anyone who believes Pitt will
formulate policy based on these discussions belongs in a geology 80
class—as an exhibit. l ‘ ~

That leaves the businesses, so eager to please both groups of
customers it will do nothing to offend either.

To be sure, all sides will agree to the need for more parking and
better land use. The citizen groups‘ will expect Pitt to pay and, at
the same time, stop grabbing as much of Oakland as it can ‘handle.
The University will expect real-estate concessions in exchange for
the sums involved. Neither will get what it wants because no one
will get anything as a result of these talks. In the end, the ﬁnan-
cially strongest-and _not the best speakers—will prevail.

‘Goodbye, Nyden--Hello, Union’

Professor Seeburger, chairman of

~the HearingBoardthat madea

“ﬁnal” review of the Nyden case, is
quoted (University Times, June 16)
as saying that “whether or ‘not
Nyden’s letter constitutes a rejec-
tion of the (Chancellor's) oﬁer is
beyond any interest we have.” -
Considering the process through
which that oﬂ’er was developed, this
is an incredible statement.

The Chancellor’s decision was
reached not solely on the basis of the
Hearing Board's review, but also on
the basis of considerable other “evi-
dence” not presentedto the Hearing
Board. Presumably, this evidence
contributed to the decision to attach
certain conditions to the offer, e.g.,
the banishment of Nyden from
faculty meetings. to‘ some extent
because he had “violat ” the
“conﬁdentiality” of such meetings.
Since the_Hearing Board developed
a “collegial” relationship with the
Chancellor, in which many aspects
of the case were discussed and an
agreement reached on the nature of
the offer to be made, the question

Studying for, taking and_ worry-

stressful. These psychological
stressors cause the body to react in

Hans Selye, of McGill Univer-

sity in Montreal, was one of the
first to study stress reactions in
depth. He proposed that any

logical stimuli, could bring about

physiological changes,
which he called the “general

number of smaller stressors
combine, or when the stressor is
chronic, “diseases of adaptation”
can occur. These include

The evidence suggests that the

large warning similar to the one‘

Dean of Case ‘

of rats ingesting saccharin in doses
equivalent of 800 diet sodas per day
that, although saccharin is a
carcinogen and produces cancer in
the bladders of second-generation
rodents, it should not be taken off
the shelves. They concluded the
benefits of saccharin most likely
outweigh’ the evils, citing the
usefulness of saccharin in tooth-
paste and in aiding diabetic and
obese people.

The six senators debating the
controversial proposal were Ed-
ward Kennedy of Massachusetts,
Richard Schweiker of Penn-
sylvania, John Chaffee of Rhode
Island, S.I. Hayakawa of Califor-
nia, Jacob Javits of New York and
Gaylord Nelson of Wisconsin.-

Senator Kennedy asked Food
and Drug Administration Commis-
sioner Don Kennedy the rationale
for banning saccharin, and the risk
from ingesting the sweetener.
“People take risks all the time
they ﬂy in airplanes, smoke, drink
and drive cars. Is eating saccharin
worse than these actions?” the
Massachusetts senator asked.
“We have no choice in protecting
the air or water. However, since
people have the right to choose

whether or not to use saccharin,
banning it may be an infringe-
ment.”
Kennedy then posed another
question to the FDA commissioner.
“Cigarettes haven’t been banned,

yet thousands die of lung cancer

from cigarettes every year. Is
saccharin worse than cigarettes?”

Dr. Donald Fredrickson, director
of the National Institute of Health,
estimated saccharin is about
one-tenth as potent as cigarettes.

Both Edward and Donald Ken-
nedy, armed with cans of Tab and
Fresca, agreed larger warning
labels are needed. Senator
Schweiker, however, was not
satisfied with the work of the FDA
to date.‘

Cigarettes and sodium nitrite,
(an additive in products like bacon)
are far more carcinogenic than
saccharin, yet they are still on the
market,” noted the angry Penn-
sylvania senator.

The commissioner countered by
saying he would look into the
matter. He also explained he had

only been the FDA head for three 

months.
All participants at the hearing

agreed that more tests must .be.s—~

performed before taking saccharin
off of the shelves.

Although saccharin has been
around since the turn of the
century, it has come under public
scrutiny only recently. A good
study of the sweetener's effects on

humans would take 30 years. The‘)

rats study took only a couple of
years, and some people are
questioning the reliability of a
study using the equivalent of 800
diet drinks per day.

W333?’ '1 PS9Ch- Offers ‘Pairing’ With Other Half
Step In Right Direction .,  

ByMARYHALL

Irene J akab, MD, PhD, came to
Pittsburgh from Boston. She arrived
here in 1974, bringing with her an
idea that has become a reality on the
sixth ﬂoor of Western Psychiatric
Institute and Clinic (WPIC).

That idea is called the John Merck
Program——a treatment unit for
children from three to 10 years old
who suffer from both mental
retardation and emotional disor-
ders.

According to J akab, Professor of
Clinical Psychiatry, the program is
the ﬁrst and only one of its kind in the
United States. she designed it while
at Harvard University Medical
School, motivated by what she
recognized as a gap in available
treatment for children with both
mental and emotional disorders. I

“The need is so great because
three percent of the population in the

‘ United States is retarded. Within

that three percent, 20 to 25 percent
have emotional problems,” Dr,
Jakab said.

“In the United States for the past
60 or more years, treatment of
psychiatric patients and retardates
has been separated,” she contin-
ued. ‘ ‘ Before that, they were treated
together. Now state schools are
established and separated from
state hospitals.” ‘

Jakab said this separation of
treatment has been a giant step in
the right direction. She pointed out
that a further problem exists,
however,because persons with two
handicaps do not ﬁt neatly into either
category. ‘

“Many people who are retarded
have been admitted to institutions
and forgotte ’ she said. “Their
strange behavior has been attrib-
uted to their retardation, and often
the presence of emotional problems
has been overlooked. This is
unfortunate. This is one thing we are
trying to combat and right.

“By alleviating emotional dis-
turbances, we are able to bring a
person’s thinking and functioning
closer to his .full potential, even
though that potential may be less
than that of others his age.

“Conversely, a child of seven
years who has never talked must not
only have his emotional disorders
dealt with, but must be taught
communication skills as well,”
J akab contined. “We have to bring
his experiences up to date.

“It is hard to say whether the
retardation causes the emotional
problems, or if the emotional
problems contribute to the retarda-
tion. That he does in fact possess
both problems is our concern.” It is
insufficient to remove or alleviate
one problem without treating the
other in these patients, J akab said.
“Often brain damage is the reason
for a child's retardation.”

Jakab has therefore brought
together a staff of specialists at
WPIC who cover both areas of

treatment, including a pediatrician,
special education teachers, an art
therapist, a speech therapist, a child
psychiatrist, social workers, nurses
and others.

These specialists work with the
children on a one-to-one basis, but
approach their task as a team.

“Upon admittance to the pro-
gram, each child is evaluated
carefully. It is then decided what
types of treatment will be best for the
child,” Jakab said. “For instance,
of the 20 children in the program
now, 11 are receiving art therapy
treatment. ’ ’

“A very important part of our
program is establishing personal
relationships, as that is often the
very thing the child needs. It is our
yardstick of improvement,” Jakab
said.

“For that reason, the children
want to stay here. When they leave,
we allow them to take something
familiar—a toy, perhaps. Postcards
are sent to the children, and
telephone contact is made often.
Our follow up program is one of our
strong points. We evaluate each
child every three months after
discharge for the first year, and then
every six months. The average
length of stay is eight months to one
and a half years.

“All the children admitted to the
Merck Program have been from the
Pittsburgh area so far. This is partly
because we have not advertised our
services nationally. W e have been
on a three-year pilot period.
Although we believe in this
multi-disciplinary approach, we will
now have evidence that it does
work, and by publishing our results
we will become more widely known
and receive more distant referrals
also.”

One of the most interesting facets
of J akab’s innovative program is the

art therapy treatment. J akab,

Lonely?

Bored?

Finally beginning to realize that
your passionate affair with Farrah
Fawcett-Majors or Robert Redford
is hopelessly one-sided?

Looking for someone who will
return your calls?

Jay Albrecht won’t promise to
add pizazz to your social life but he
is willing to offer a possible step in
the right direction.

Albrecht is the creator, founder
and staff of. “Pairing,” a Pitts-
burgh-based dating service.

Initiated a year ago, “Pairing”
currently boasts a membership of
close to 70 people, a total /that is
fairly evenly divided between men
and women. ,

According to Albrecht. a gradu-
ate student in Pitt’s Human
Services, the idea for the dating
service sprang from his curiosity
about the human psyche’s work-
ings. V

“I was interested in why people
select other people,” he said, “and
that’s what the service is all
about.”

While most people have to make
their own judgments about poten-
tial partners, Albrecht’s clients are
presented with a set of neat,
orderly descriptions of available
members of the opposite sex.

Anyone seeking to join the
service must submit an entry fee
and standarized list of personal
qualities, likes and dislikes. The
prospective member must also
supply a list of attributes preferred
in another person.

H Once in the program, a new
member may request detailed
descriptions of a specified number
of other members. From that point
on, said Albrecht, the member is
on his or her own.

“We aren’t a matching service,”
he explained. “We provide the

members with the descriptions.

It’s up to them to make whatever

contacts they want.”
Thoughonly slightly more men

than women are enrolled in
“Pairing,” a marked imbalance in
age groups tends to narrow one’s

choice of companions.

Albrecht has had to turn away
males in their 20s because of an
overabundance of applicants in that
age group. At the same time, he
lamented, less than 20 percent of
all female applicants are under 30.

“I have a crying need for women
in their 20s,” said Albrecht, who
attributed younger females’ hesi-
tancy to join with a conservative

attitude which, he feels, is

characteristic of the Pittsburgh V

area.

While he would welcome a more
daring attitude in local date-seek-
ers, Albrecht is careful to keep his
enterprise—as the advertisements
claim--‘ ‘ civilized. ’ ’ Apparently,
the “macho” approach is frowned
upon by the services’ members.

“l’ve had to ask a couple of men
to leave the service,” said
Albrecht. “They were coming on
too strong and I was - getting
complaints from the women.”

Though “Pairing” members pay
a fee for its services, Albrecht
contends that.he views the venture
as a hobby and will return the
money to a disgruntled customer.
He sees his involvement as a
learning experience and has come

to several general conclusions
about the process of partner
selection.

“I’ve noticed,” he said, “that.
women will pick up on a word that A
describes a man's emotional
quality. ‘Men, on the other hand,
tend to look first at such things as
age and height.”

What are the chances that a
dating service date will lead to
marital bliss?

“To tell you the truth,” said
Albrecht, “I don’t follow up on
contacts that are made. I do know’
of two cases where the members
have continued seeing each other
for several months.”

Albrecht isn’t promising any-
thing. Apparently, however, there
are more and more people willing
to stimulate their love lives Vvith “a
little help from a friend.”

Psychopathology of Expression, is -

an intemationally-known art thera-
pist.

“Non-figurative abstraction is a
way to create distance from the
feelings which are too anxiety-pro-
ducing to be spelled out in words or
conventional forms by our patients.

“Studying the art productions of

mental patients, most of whom had
no art schooling, we find that they
express their disturbed or strong
feelings essentially through the
same methods in composition, style,
content and colors as the methods
used in the fine arts.”

“One child who drew monsters
and such visions all the time was

encouraged to draw things from real

life.” Jakab said that as the child A’

began to draw more .“norma ”
objects, he also began to think about
more normal things;

The entire program has been
successful, according to Jakab.
“Progress has indeed fulﬁlled

expectations,” she said.

Seals and Crafts —— One Bizarre Concert

By KEITHBRIAN

The master of ceremonies politely
asked the chattering audience to
refrain from smoking, as usual. The
Syria Mosque grew dark, as usual.
My glasses slid down my nose, as
usual.

, Jim Seals appeared ﬁrst. He was
clad in red high waisted, double knit

pants, a white sport coat over a blue

tie-dyed T-shirt and, of course, his

cap. My glasses were sliding again.

Next to appear under the
scanning beacon was Dash Crofts.
The collar of Crofts’ green jersey
protruded over the lapels of his

- brown suit. He wore a choker with a

silver medallion the size of an
ashtray in fire hall bingo parties.
Wearing huge turquoise rings, he
tuned his mandolin. Above his
well-groomed beard, his eyes
peered through the pink transpar-
ent wings of a rhinestone studded
butterﬂy. My glasses fell into my

lap.

The famous duct was singing
“Summer Breeze,” a song whose
harmonics have been heard across
the country for eight years.

While Seals and Crofts sang
“Wind Flowers,” green moons,
pink stars and orange sunbursts
were projected onto six screens in
the shape of right triangles ranging
in size from three to 10 feet. As
their voices faded, the actors moved
into a new scene, “the instrumen-

sound, a combination of ancient
instruments and modern electricity,
liberated the mind and relaxed
the spirit. Traditional American
folk music dissolved into an oriental
atmosphere with no instrument
change or culture shock.

Seals and Crofts then rose from
their stools and changed instru-
ments under the purple and green
‘spotlights. Seals picked up a brass
alto-saxophone and Crofts picked

of ingenuity was displayed by

waiting. My glasses were staying

Crofts played with the ampliﬁer’s

scurrying about the ﬂoor of the

wires. Dash picked up a

the stage. The band picked up and
Crofts covorted around the stage

for pictures and showing off his red

Settled back into his stool, Crofts
looked at Seals, Seals tapped his
foot three times, gave a go sign to
the band and they began “We May
Never Pass This Way Again.”
Fifteen bars into the song a
thunderous cheer rang from the
balconies, the crowd had awakened.
Blue, pink and yellow roses were
projected on the screen. “Hum-

came as the colorful ensemble
into “Diamond Girl.”

obliged with loud stamps and hoots.
Seals held a ﬁddle in his hand and
the band got into some hillbilly
jamming. They dubbed “Hog

ute ﬁddle bowing, guitar twanging,
piano banging, drum smashing jam
Crofts, showing more of his
proficiency and insanity, ran,
danced and goose stepped. Falling
on his knees in front of each
member of the hand during their
solo, he encouraged the guitar
player into contorting his face even
more.

Suddenly the musicians stopped}.
leaving the stage dark with the
exceptions of those little amber and
green lights. As the applause grew
louder and the air thicker I pushed
my glasses back onto my nose. The
band reappeared. '

Crofts picked up his mike; Seals,
his guitar; and the young man, his
wires. The music was much louder
and the only three words under-
standable were “Blue Bonnet

Seals removed his six-string,
picked up a microphone and joined
his partner. “Get Closer,” a more
vocal tune, was much easier to cope
with. After shaking hands with
those in the front row the twosome

trod off stage singing, “Put your
love in my hands...”

t Racquetball Growing

By TOM FISHER

Racquetball is a relatively new
sport, but it is steadily overtaking
tennis as America's fastest growing
participation sport. To prove its
popularity, there were only 50,000
racquetball players in 1970 while
the number has climbed to more
than 3,000,000 today, according to a
recent Newsweek article.

Consequently, Marilyn Ross, the
women's intramural coordinator at
Pitt, isn’t surprised at this upsurge
of interest in racquetball. However,
those unfamiliar with the sport may
want to know about the equipment,
the playing court, and some basic
rules.

The racquetball resembles a
stubby tennis racquet, and the
hollow rubber balls are made
especially for the sport.

“Racquetball is relatively inex-
pensive to play once you buy your
racquet and balls,’ ’ Ross said. ‘ ‘You
can get a racquet for $10 to $12 and a
set of two racquetballs for around
$3.”

Racquetball is played on an ..

enclosed court 20 feet wide, 20 feet
deep and 40 feet long. The court has
two separate base lines crossing
the court and parallel to the front
' wall. The front.(service) and rear
(short) base line are 15 and 20 feet

   

from the front wall respectively.
The receiving line, a three-inch

vertical line located at the base of
each side wall and ﬁve feet back of
the short line, marks the place
where the player receiving the serve
stands. 3

In racquetball, the player who
ﬁrst reaches 21 points wins the
game. An opponent’s shot must be
returned off the front wall on the ﬂy
(with or without the beneﬁt of the
back wall, side walls, or the ceiling)
before it touches the ﬂoor twice.

The serve, an integral part of
racquetball, is made while standing
within the court area bounded by
the service and short‘lines. A player
gets two chances to make a
successful serve during his/her
service.

A successful serve first hits the
front wall on the ﬂy and bounces at
least once on the floor in back of the
short line before touching the rear
wall. A serve not returned by an
opponent is called an “ace.”

Only the server can score points,
awarded when an “ace” is served
or a volley is won. When a volley is
lost, the server loses the serve.

Along with the basic rules,

‘ strategy plays a vital role in
racquetball. “You should try to
develop your hitting skill first,”
Ross commented. “After playing

- awhile, you can work on the

different kinds of shots. Your shots
depend on your opponent’s position
and the level of his return shot.

“Your serve is your best
offensive weapon,” Ross contin-
ued. “You should try to develop a
wide array of serves to keep your
opponent off balance.”

Ross also mentioned that center
court is the perfect position for a
player-

Besides rules and strategy, there
are many advantages in racquet-
ball.

“Men can play women,” Ross
explained. “All age levels can play
——the risk of injury is slight. There is
no advantage to bigness or tallness
in this sport. It’s skill and mastery
of shots that count.”

Racquetball, played indoors, is a
year-round sport. It accommodates
both singles and doubles competi-
tion as well as cut-throat competi-
tion between three players.

Kerry Dearﬁeld, a graduate
student in the Life Sciences
Department, has been playing
racquetball for a short time and
already is impressed with the sport.

“It is a good competitive game,” 0

he said. ‘ ‘I get a very good workout
in a short amount of time.”
