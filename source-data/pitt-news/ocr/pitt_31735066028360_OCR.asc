Survey shows increased tuition
No. I reason students leave

University of Pittsburgh

News Editor

When Julie looked over her tuition bill thisyear, she
noticed two grants she usually receives from Pitt were not
listed. A call to the financial aid office informed her that the
money she made working an extra job made her ineligible
to get the grants.

“I couldn’t believe they were telling me that because I
made more money, I couldn’t get the grants,” said Julie, a
Pitt senior, who didn’t want her last name published.

Nothing else had changed financially for Julie. Her moth-
er works part-time, and her father is laid off: that is why she
was given the grants which total $1,000.

Betsy Porter, director of admissions and financial aid,
admits there are cases when, because the student earns more

money, they sacrifice grants from the university.

“Pitt awards need money in the same way federal or state
would,” Porter said. “The federal formula suggests money
earned by students contributes at a higher percentage than
the earned income of parents.”

Julie worked three jobs over the past year in order to pay
her rent and make ends meet.

“I think they should know that most students don’t get
jobs to pay for tuition,” Julie said.

Porter said Julie’s situation is not the norm, because most
students require multiple forms of financial assistance. Most
of the time, students still qualify for all forms of assistance.

‘‘It depends on the situation, but generally students who
increase their own earnings reduce their loan eligibility,”
Porter said.

Porter sees this as positive, because the students have less
money to pay back once they graduate.

Over the summer, the provost office for academic affairs
sent a survey to a sample of students who had above aver-
age grades but who chose not to return to Pitt. The respons-
es indicated increasing tuition and fees were the number one

“Animal” didn’t flinch at
all when his lower lip was
clamped with a set of for-
ceps and an autoclave sani-
tized surgical needle was
pushed through his face... -

“I didn’t even bite you,”
Animal said, with a brand
new piercing in his lip.

“I do appreciate that,” said
Gary Morgan, the man who
performed the piercing, as he
dutifully wiped the small
drops of blood from Animal’s
scruffy chin.

Animal is the owner of
Midian Tattooing, in
Tarentum, Pa. His massive
body is covered with brightly
colored and black tattoos,
and, after Mogan’s latest
addition, he has 15 body
piercings.

This conversation took
place at the Third Annual
“Meeting of the Marked”
convention held this weekend
at the Monroeville Palace
Inn. Artists and spectators
from all over the country
came to perform or observe
tattooing and body piercing
in the three-day event.

Through the maze of ink-
adorned flesh and jewelry

body parts, this expo show-
cased the skills of 36 differ-
ent artists who came from as
far as Humansville, Mont.
and_ as close as Morgan’s
Hellion House in the Strip
District of Pittsburgh.
Bare-chested men and
some bikini-clad women

whichever piercing or tattoo
artist looked appealing. ,
“Gary is the best I have
ever seen, and he’s the only
one I’ll let touch me,”
Animal said. “The piercing

~ didn’t bother me any more

than when the forceps were
put in my mouth. Pain is a
matter of focus.” -

Morgan normally does his
piercings in the storefront of
the Strip District’s Iron City
Ink Tattooing. Like many
other artists at the expo, he is
performing his art in public
to show how safe it can be in
the hands of a professional.

Using “hospital standard”

sterilization techniques and
providing after-care informa-
tion to his clients, Morgan
takes it upon himself to set
professional standards that
are not required by
Pennsylvania health laws.
“Unfortunately, there are
no laws artists have to adhere
to,” Morgan said. “But we
take it upon ourselves.
People getting good healthy

piercings is good for all of v

us.” .

Despite the care taken by
Morgan, he says some clients
have suffered minor infec-
tions, but it usually is
because they didn’t follow

By carving jack—o-lanterns
and baking brownies, a hand-
ful of Pitt students brought the
spirit of Halloween to a local
women’s shelter in downtown
Pittsburgh.

Bearing homemade goodies
and the spirit of the season,
members of the Campus
Women’s Organization gath-
ered last Thursday evening at
Miryam’s homeless shelter in
order to bring a little cheer
and friendship to women who
are less fortunate.

“This is something I can tell ‘

my grandkids about,” said one
woman as she outlined eye-
lashes on the face of a pump-
kin that she described as “a
strong but beautiful” woman.
“This is the first time in all
my years I ever carved a
pumpkin."

Another woman was given
a hand by CWO co—president.
Leslie Albanese, as she carved
the triangles she had outlined
with black marker.

“I’m carving this pumpkin
because I want the seeds.”
joked a woman named
Lucretia. “Got to do your part
to get the benefits.”

And the shelter offers many
benefits to the women who
call Miryam’s home or simply
a temporary safe place to hang
out or to feel welcomed and
safe.

Miryam’s is unique because
it’s the only shelter in
Pittsburgh which cares for
homeless women who are
mentally ill. It also provides

JERUSALEM — The man

movement that has continu-

Israelis, was shot to death

in Malta last week.

Islamic Jihad sources

arrived in Syria. However,

WASHINGTON — Less

President Clinton made his

until money is restored for
health, education and the

The Senate approved the
bill by a 52-47 vote shortly

Fifty years following the
start of the Cold. War, a
Russian general blasted a
U.S. nuclear silo for the
first time on Saturday,

applauded the action.
Russian Defense Minister
Pavel Grachev said the
demonstration was an

empty silo, which had once
housed a nuclear missile.
Under nuclear treaties, the

Pitt News history lessons...

25 years ago — Thursday, Oct. 29, 1970

°About 80 students came to an open session designed to allow
students to voice their concerns to university administrators, includ-
ing Chancellor Wesley Posvar. Some issues brought up included
the rise in the room and board fee and university expansion on
Forbes Avenue.

“We are also aware that many students are being exploited by
Oakland landlords,” said Edison Montgomery, vice chancellor of
ﬁnance. “We are working toward a solution where the supply for
housing begins to get closer to demands.”

15 years ago — Wednesday, Oct. 29, 1980

0A Pitt student was struck by a Port Authority bus while trying to
cross Fifth Avenue in front of the Litchﬁeld Towers. Two days later,
Kim Kormanik, 21, was said to be in good condition at
Presbyterian Hospital.

This was the ﬁrst week of PAT ’s reverse trafﬁc ﬂow bus lane on
Fifth Avenue. PAT spokesperson Mel Seidenberg said many stu-
dents may have been forgetting that Fifth Avenue is no longer a
one-way street

“We’re concerned that people coming out of the dorms forget
this and only look one way,” he said.

5 years ago — Tuesday, Oct. 30, 1990 —

°According to a survey, many students didn’t feel safe about the
reopened Fifth Avenue bus lane. Out of the 40 students asked, 71
percent said they didn’t feel safe. Many had witnessed accidents
and near accidents involving buses traveling on the bus lane and
students trying to cross the street.

1 year ago — Monday, Oct. 31. 1994

°Two people showed up at an open fonim designed to allow stu-
dents and faculty to talk about what kind of qualities they would
like to see in the new senior vice chancellor for the health sciences.

The search committee, with Mark Nordenberg as chairperson,
listened to the concerns of Dr. Thomas Zullo, who said the new
senior vice chancellor should have a background of success in
research and should have sound adrninistrative skills.

the only day program for

4 homeless women in the area.

Other shelters force women to
leave in the daytime and only
provide meals and lodging in
the evenings.

“It’s women helping
women,” said Pitt graduate
student, Deana Krizan, who
works part-time at the shelter.
“It’s a place the women can
come and discuss their prob-
lems. They share a lot of the
same experiences, and, for
many of them, Miryam’s is
the first place that they’ve
built friendships with other
women.”

Krizan, who is working
toward her masters degree in
social work, said she chose
Miryam’s because she wanted
to be more than a guard or
another warm body.

“Miryam’s is a special
place. It’s a grass—roots orga-
nization, and it’s personal.”
says Krizan. “We don’t just
lump everyone together. We
-care about the "women as indi-
viduals, and that’s the type of
environment I w'ant to work
in.”

She also said that many pro-
grams are offered to the
women, such as AIDS educa-
tion, as well as many volun-
teers who share their time by
coming to the shelter.

“Many groups bring food,
and we really appreciate it,
but what the women truly

reason they did not return.

Jack Daniel, vice provost
for academic affairs, said
the study is inconclusive
because of the sample size.

“The survey was given to
1,169 students, and approxi-
mately 275 responded,”
Daniel said. “This was only
a 24.5 percent response
rate,” Daniel said.

Despite the claim that the
study is inconclusive,
Provost James Maher has
made student retention one
of his top priorities this
yean j '

“We did not just do the
study and then do nothing
about it,” Daniel said. ‘

Over the past two years,
tuition has increased at Pitt.
In response, the availability

of - financial aid has
increased at the same rate,
according to Daniel.

“We have done our best to
keep tuition increases to a
minimum,” Daniel said. “In
addition, the provost office
was given permission to add
several hundred dollars to
the financial aid budget this
year.”

In the meantime, none of
this will help Julie and other
students who ‘earned extra
money to pay for groceries
or to pay the bills.

“The best thing a student
can do is discuss their situa-
tion with a Pitt financial
counselor, said Porter. “We
would be very frank in
determining what an
increase in the student’s
income would mean.”

interaction that lets them share

Krizan.

The volunteers gain just as
much ‘as the women do,
according to CWO co-presi-
dent Amy Sitnick, who spent
the trip to the shelter sharing
clean-up duty in the kitchen.

“The women are amazing. I

woman who has four kids.

They’re very open and very .

“I’m really glad we took the

the after-care sheet he gives
them.

‘Mike Fenn, a piercer from
Body Designs in Long Island,
N.Y. has been doing piercings
for 15 years. He has the same
high standards Morgan does,
but says there have been rare
instances of problems with
some artists.

%‘‘There is a guy who is doing
jail time because he ‘blew out’
someone’s'eye with a piercing

I gun doing an eyebrow pierc-

ing,”. Fenn said.
Fenn said that piercings
have been popular for years,

but recently they have become
mainstream because of public-
ity and because it is a non—per—
manent expression of person-
alities. .

According to all the piercers,
genital and nipple piercings
cause greater sexual stimula-
tion. Morgan said that people
like how the piercings look, as
well as how they feel.

After his piercing, Animal

will have to keep a metal stud
in his lip for two toithree
months. A nose piercing only
takes three weeks, and the cost
for these procedures is $35
and up.

Unlike piercings which can

fill in if not used, tattoos are
permanent and can only be
removed by a surgical proce-
dure that can leave a scar
sometimes less appealing than
the tattoo.

For the artist, tattooing
doesn’t allow for mistakes.
Unlike a piece of drawing
paper, skin cannot be erased.

“Fuzz” watches as Animal
gets his lip pierced.

“You have to fall in love
with a tattoo-,” Fuzz said.
“This is an expression of art
and shouldn’t be considered a
fad or something ‘cool.”’

recorded as early as 600 B.C.,.
to a modern art form that still
holds a dark mystique and
popular misconceptions.

“In our piercing shop and
tattoo studio, we have done
doctors, lawyers, schoolteach-
ers and nurses,” Morgan said.
“Barn Morris from the Steelers
even got a tattoo from us, so
there are no stereotypes as to
the typical client.”

In fact, a highlight of the
convention for some people
was the opportunity to bare all
and not to be looked at as

Opinions

I Police are people too

By now you might have heard about the controversy sur-
rounding the death of Jonny Gammage earlier this month.
First, we were told that Gammage, the cousin and business
partner of Pittsburgh Steeler Ray Seals, was eluding capture
and led police on a high speed chase through three counties.
Then we heard Gammage was unduly harassed by police who‘
stopped him for driving “erratically” and that he died mysteri-
ously during police questioning at the site. Then we heard
Gammage was beaten to death by the pursuing officers. Now
we are told, two weeks later, that police investigators have
“found” marijuana in Gammage’s car.

All these different stories relate to the death of one man in
the hands of police officers from Brentwood and two other

' counties (they were not Pittsburgh city police). Gammage’s
death was not necessarily at the hands of the officers (that has
not yet been determined one way or another), but it is certain
that stories have changed and evidence has been fuzzy at best
since the incident happened.

The Gammage case has raised many questions about
whether or not police are abusing the power they have. It
would certainly appear that in Gammage’s case there is a
strong possibility that there were at least some abuses of
power. That will be difficult to prove, however, since too many
facts are unclear and the only witnesses are other police offi-
cers. -

The problem is that since the Gammage incident, at least 90
other people (in either the city or in suburbs around Pittsburgh)
have come forward claiming police brutality. Since Jesse
Jackson visited last weekend to claim racism on the part of
police, new accusations of police brutality areisurfacing fast.

There can be no doubt that there is a certain amount of abuse
of the power given to public servants, especially the police.
“Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely,” as
the saying goes. That it is commonplace or expected, however,
does not in any way excuse abuse of police power.

However, there can also be little doubt that some of the
recently surfaced accusations are nothing more than red her-
rings. There could be any number of reasons why someone
would fabricate a claim of police brutality, including desire for
money or recognition.

It is a sad reflection of our society that corruption still exists
in "our public services. One might have hoped that abuse of
police power would have gone the way of Al Capone and the
1920s’ underworld. But it hasn’t. There still are, and probably
always will be, police who think they are above the law.

However, it is an even sadder comment that all police offi-
cers are being lumped into the same category as the bad ele-
ments who abuse their power. Those who do abuse their police
power should be removed from service and punished to the
fullest extent of the law. But not all police officers are corrupt.
Many are ordinary people like us, with families and friends,
who perform admirably in the line of duty. Those men and
women, who risk their lives every day in faithful service to the
public, should be thanked and applauded instead of blindly
accused.

Sonic Youth Against Fascism

et’s say
Ted I have
Kaplan Lt h .i s
'—"-j‘ friend who is
really kind of restless —
overworked, undergraded, a
little bit tired of the Zelda’s
scene, a little bit outspoken
and opinionated — and he
and some other people were
hanging out, talking, listen-
ing to Fugazi, and this kid
just decided he wanted to
start a new club on campus.
The idea was to have a ubiq-
uitous group — organizing
debates, lectures, literature
readings — and basically
just trying to provide more
forums by which the inter-
ests and opinions of all the
different groups on campus
could be expressed and, in so
doing, perhaps create a little
more understanding among
Pitt students. ’

Fine, harmless enough, so
the kid started working on it.
In fact, he had the applica-
tion all typed up and ready
for submission. The name of
the group was to be “Youth
Against Fascism,” after the
Sonic Youth tune. Well, last
night the kid got a nice cour-
tesy call from a member of
the Nazi party. The kid was
told that the name he chose,
though not intended to indi-
cate a threat, was going to
piss off several radical politi-
cal (?) groups in Oakland,
including the Nazis, Clan
Rook, S.A.R.C. (?), etc. And
the kid thought, “Uh,
whoops.”

I would like to make a
clarification here. Thus far,
we have no intentions of
mounting an all-out assault

~on Nazis and the like.

Though I personally think
that would be a very noble
cause, that is not what this
group is intended to be
about. I am making this clar-
ification so that we do not
receive death threats and
gangs of skinheads pounding

on our doors. As a token of
our good will (?), we are no
longer the “Youth Against
Fascism.” We are now the
“Youth Against Getting Our
Asses Kicked.” If this
doesn’t work for people, we
are welcoming any sugges-
tions, preferably ones that
have cool acronyms. Maybe
we could call the group
“Youth Who Should Just
Shut Up.” I don’t know. A

Really. though, this whole
incident has disturbed me.
I’m really just a little boy in
a sick, sick city. Day in and
day out, I watch the shuttles
carry people up the hill. 1
watch 12,000 lives go by,
simple lives, with so many
things taken for granted. We
hit. the bars on Thursday
nights, frat houses on week-
ends; we wonder about our
grades and what the cafe is
serving tonight. We have all
this petty anxiety, all our lit-
tle faux social complications;
We had the OJ trial for,
what, nine months, was it? I
was walking to campus the
other day, and I saw a line of
little kids on a field trip
walking in formation down
the sidewalk. Now, forgive
me for getting a little teary-
eyed here, but I really think
we were all a lot cooler when
we were little. I also think
that we were a lot stronger.
Back then we didn’t need to
find scapegoats; we didn’t
need to retaliate. Back then
we didn’t need organizations
to have friends. We didn’t
need -to get fucked up every
night to have fun. Really, we
are a little less than children
now.

But some are worse than
others. There are so many
ways to blame others for the
world's problems. There are
so many ways to make a leap

-of Kierkegaardian propor-

tions into the sphere of infi-
nite hatred and stupidity.
Sometimes I think we’re all

half-way there. But if we are,
it doesn’t matter, because
luckily (?) our motivations
are nullified by our apathy
and ignorance. Some of us,
however, have made it all the
way, have become Nazis,
Clan Rookers, Bosnian
Serbs, Louis Farrakhan
wannabes, hardcore pro-lif-
ers (forgive me, I had to
stick that in) and any other
assortment of delusional
people. Most of these people
live in infinite hatred and/or
ignorance and/or self-right-
eousness and/or stupidity,
and from this they define
their identity and purpose. I
think it takes a coward to
live this way; it takes a
bunch of silly little brats
who need to learn the rules
of the playground. 3

Well, I’m obviously not the
one to teach: I’m probably
not strong enough. And
frankly, after talking to a
Nazi for 20 minutes. I really
feel a little out of my league.
I’m a little boy in a sick, sick
city, and maybe I’m just
going to sit down and wait

for something to happen.-_

Time will go by. Then one

day the little kids all get ’

blown up by some fascist"s
time bomb in their day—care
center. And we still go to
Zelda’s every Thursday night
and the frat houses on the
weekends. and this all just

‘ strikes me as kind of bizarre.
I could be wrong though.

Actually, it’s not even me:

it’s my friend, right‘? And}
he’s just a little boy in a sick,_T

sick city that sure as hell
isn’t home. Still the Man
says, “This is the point: this
is the manifest bed for the
scraping, dirty little secret
reason for the gathering con-
sequence; what else is there
to do but go outside. look
around, look around." Look
around.

Ted Kaplan is just a boy in a I

sick, sick city.

V Brad opposite.
‘ Isles After loss-

es to Temple

A and Rutgers, I’m convinced

that there is a Jonathan Doe
in some higher place who
has it in for the Panther

‘ football program.

In a methodical manner,
Doe has picked apart the
squad in accordance to the
seven deadly sins.
= '°GLUTTONY: (excess in
eating or drinking) Doe has
wiggled himself into the
minds of certain players and
convinced them to stay out
until last call at some local
drinking establishments on
the nights before games.
T-he result was mistake-
firlled sluggish play that can
be directly related to more
than one of the team’s loss-
es.

°GREED: (excessive
desire for wealth or posses-
sions) After victories the
first ‘two games of the sea-
son against Washington
State and Eastern Michigan,
the talk about making it to a
bowl for the first time since
1989 seemed realistic. But
Doe came to town in the

' form of a Buckeye. He then

made a special guest appear-
ance as a Hokie. Then he
took the forms of an Owl
and a Scarlet Knight to take
what were “sure wins” away
from the reeling Panthers.
With these losses, Doe
squashed all hopes of a bowl
bid.

°SLOTH: (disinclination
to action or labor) For most
of the season, coach Johnny
Majors has singled out the
receiving corps for its lack-
luster performances. Doe is
the one who has choreo-
graphed all those dropped
balls and wrong pass routes.

-PRIDE: (reasonable or
justifiable self-respect) Doe
has taken every last little
microgram of pride left at
this university. That was
evident in the stands against
Ohio State when Buckeye
fans outnumbered Pitt fans
2-1 and when only 28,974
showed up for the
Homecoming game against
Miami. People just don't

Rutgers crushes Piﬂ 42-24

By Mike Kovak
Asst. Sports Editor

PISCATAWAY, N.J. — In a game ﬁlled
with big mistakes and big plays," the Pitt
football team dropped its seventh consecu-
tive game, _losing 42-24 to Rutgers
Saturday.

“It’s a crazy game with crazy people,”
Panther head coach Johnny Majors said.

The big plays eluded both teams in the
ﬁrst quarter. Lethargic play abounded. Both
teams were scoreless.

Then, some strange form of voodoo pos-
sessed both teams. During the second quar-
ter, Pitt and Rutgers amassed 44 points.
Every time Pitt scored, Rutgers answered
back. Sometimes it answered a couple times
in a row.

“Both teams got comfortable with each
others’ defenses,” receiver Curtis Anderson
said.

Pitt answered first. After Zatiti Moody
forced a fumble by Rutgers quarterback Ray
Lucas, Pete Gonzalez found Dietrich Jells
on the next play for a 37-yard touchdown

pass. Jells finished the game with nine
catches for 152 yards.

Rutgers All—American tight end Marco
Battaglia is known for making educated
guesses. After Lucas engineered the Scarlet
Knight offense down to the Pitt 13-yard
line, he found Battaglia in the end zone. A
few juggles later, Battaglia leached onto the
pigskin.

With 9:34 remaining in the ﬁrst half, the
score was tied at seven.

Seventeen seconds later, Demetrius Harris
wanted to respond. Harris, who rushed 17

times for 135 yards, busted around the right

after Darren Dombroski screwed up the
snap on the point after conversion.

“The Harris run brought us to life,”
Anderson said.

Temple return-er/running back Terrell
Willis took the ensuing kickoff 83 yards for
a score. Rutgers took the lead 14-13.

After a Pitt field goal by Chris Ferencik
and a Rutgers touchdown reception by

Steve Harper, Rutgers led 21-16 with 48
seconds left in the half.

Mark Butler once again had trouble ﬁeld-
ing a kick, and the ball was recovered by
Chris Anzidei of Rutgers. A few plays later,
Battaglia knew the right answer on a 21-
yard score from Lucas. The Scarlet Knights
led 28-16 at intermission.

The second half started out in a Very inter-
esting manner. After Pitt drove down to the
Rutgers 16-yard line, the turning point of
the game occured. What appeared to be a
first down completion to Anderson at the
two turned into a 100-yard fumble return for
a touchdown by Paul Rivers. With 11:55
left in the third quarter, Pitt trailed 35-16.

“I thought that was a bad call,” Anderson
said. ‘The ground knocked the ball loose.”

Exciting. Enthusiastic. Even fun. These are the kinds of words
that spirited freshman Annemarie Tarara uses to describe volley-
ball, and specifically the Pitt women’s volleyball team.

The strong sense of tradition at Pitt helped attract Tarara. The
Lady Panthers’ current streak of seven consecutive Big East cham-
pionships is important to her, even though she wasn’t even in
junior high school when it started.

“Hopefully we can continue the tradition. It’ll be tough with the
addition of Notre Dame [who joined the Big East this season], but
it’s exciting. Everybody’s pumped. We’re looking forward to it,”
Tarara said. '

Maintaining a tradition is nothing new to Tarara.

“I’ve always been in programs with strong winning traditions,”
she said. “It’s exciting to‘ be part of a winning team. Being around
that tradition is exciting.” _

From the beginning, Tarara knew she would ﬁt in well in Pitt’s
volleyball program. That realization was a major factor in her deci-
sion to attend Pitt.

“I really liked the coaches, and I got along with a lot of people
on the team,” Tarara said. “I knew there would be good chemistry
on this team.”

Tarara didn’t even meet any of the current freshmen on the team
until a tournament she attended after she had already agreed to
play for Pitt. That didn’t hurt the team’s chemistry, according to
Tarara. .

“We’re getting along great,” Tarara said. “There’s a lot of fresh-
men on the team, and we hang out a lot. We have a lot of fun.”

Nearly half of the team members are freshmen. Tarara describes
that group as “vocal, energetic, and really enthusiastic,” and those
qualities are apparent to coach Cindy Alvear.

“[Tarara] enjoys volleyball the way I wish everyone did,” Alvear
said. “She’s fun to coach. Our whole freshman class is easy to get

Cross country teams
finish ninth in Bi
East Champions ips

By Kevin Lilley
Staff Writer

The Pitt Panther men’s and women’s cross-country
teams each took ninth place in the Big East
Championships held last Saturday. The races, held at
Van Cortlandt Park in New York, were both dominated
by the Providence squad, which took first in both thir-
teen-team fields.

The highest finisher for Pittsburgh was senior Frank
Nesko, who placed 23rd in the 126-runner field with a
time of 25:51 on the five-mile course. Junior Ed
Adamson placed 53rd in the field, and sophomores
Rich Walsh, Matt Samuel and senior Dennis Kuntz also
scored for the men’s team.

Wa1sh’s third-place finish was the pleasant surprise
of the afternoon for the Pitt squad. Head coach Dave
Sobal said that Walsh “put it all together” in Saturday's
race, notching his highest finish of the season in the
championship meet.

“He gets the gold star for the day,” said Sobal.

The day’s other surprise was the Providence women’s
team, which broke a six-year Villanova dynasty in the
Big East with a dominant performance. All five of
Providence’s scorers placed in the top twenty positions
of the contest, putting the Lady Friars 14 points ahead
of the Lady Wildcats and nearly 250 ahead of the Lady
Panthers.

For the Pitt women, junior Angie Martin finished
43rd in the 127-runner women’s field with a 3.1-mile
time of 19:24. Junior Stephanie Ellsworth placed 55th,
followed by sophomore teammate Amy Francy, who

PISCATAWAY, NJ. — Before

coaching veteran thought he’d

After the game, Majors stood
corrected. Now he has seen it

“I don’t know when I’ve seen

“I haven’t seen itallyet.”

What Majors did see was a
handful of bizane plays that led
to a 42-24 Pitt loss, which was
the Panthers’ seventh in a row.

Following an ordinary and
stagnant ﬁrst quarter, weird stuff
started to happen. After Rutgers
tied the game at seven, Pitt,

mage, handed off to freshman

right, eluded a couple of defend-
ers and tap-danced down the
sidelines for a 74-yard touch-
down run.

But Rutgers’ Terrell Willis,
who leads the Big East in all-
purpose yardage, took the fol-
lowing kickoff and raced up the
gut of Pitt’s special team unit,
ran into a mass of defenders and
broke through for a 84-yard
touchdown retum.

The score signiﬁed the third
touchdown in exactly 30 sec-
onds.

Down 16-14, Rutgers milked
the clock perfectly with a 63-
yard touchdown drive, leaving
Pitt with only 48 seconds on its
next possession

But Mark Butler fumbled the

ball fell right in Darren
Dombroski’s hands, who, in
turn, lost it to Rutgers’ Chris

again, giving them a 28-16
bulge entering halftime.

“It was weird,” Pitt linebacker
Torn Tumulty said. “It was a
game full of crazy plays. You
didr1’t know what was going to
happen next.”

The two teams, who have
both struggled offensively this
year, combined for 44 points in
the second quarter alone.

Not weird enough? Okay,

_there’s more.

The Panthers, who started
with the ball in the second half,
pieced together an impressive
drive. VV1th Pitt on Rutgers’ 16-
yard line, quarterback Pete
Gonzalez found Curtis
Anderson at the two. Anderson
twisted and reached toward the
goal line.

A score here would have cut
the lead to 28-24 with almost
the whole second half to play.
Instead, as Majors put it, “I real-
ly couldn’t believe my eyes.”

As Anderson lunged,
the ball was knocked
loose and, safety Paul

Rivers scooped it up and ran
100 yards for an improbable
touchdown.

“I thought it was a bad 
said Anderson, who had seven
catches for 98 yards. “I stretched
with the ball, and the ground
knocked it loose. I looked up for
a whistle, but they didn’t see it
that way.”

“In all my years of coaching,
I’ve never seen that play in my
whole life,” Majors said.

A quarter and a half later, the
Panthers, being the considerate
guests that they are, gave
Rutgers another generous offer-
mg.

John Ryan, who replaced a

wounded Gonzalez and previ-

ously orchestrated a touchdown
drive, threw an interception on a

‘desperate fourth-down attempt,

right to Charles Woolridge.

Woolridge put the exclamation .  ' if 

point on the melee when he
returned it 25 yards for yet
another touchdown.

“It’s a crazy game with crazy
people,” Majors said

along with. They all love to play.’’

Some of Tarara’s enthusiasm seems to be rub-
bing off on the rest of the team. ’

“So many freshmen come in and worry
where they’ll fit in,” Alvear said. “She leads the
pack and creates her own environment. She
thinks, ‘It’s my world and I’ll dictate what hap-
pens.’ She creates a positive environment for
people around her.”

The transition from high school to college for
an athlete is not just about a positive attitude.
There is still a game to be played, and it can be
a quite different game. Tarara was a unanimous
all-conference selection last year playing at
Naperville High School in Naperville, 111., but
she recognizes the major difference in competi-
tion between high school and college.

“Division I volleyball is a giant step up from
high school,” Tarara said. “The level of compe-
tition is high. It’s so intense.”

Alvear believes Tarara is making the transi-
tion to the next level quite nicely.

“All freshmen go through a period where
they ask ‘Can I do this?”’ Alvear said. “[Tarara]
is adjusting the most rapidly. She was the ﬁrst
to consciously decide she would make a home
for herself here, not just on the court, but acade-
mically too. And socially, she obviously _has
some gifts.”

Tarara had some experience that helped her
adjust to the better competition at the college
level. The Sports Performance Club, for which
Tarara played volleyball from seventh grade
through the end of high school, is considered
one of the best clubs in the Midwest. You won’t
get any arguments on that point from Tarara.

“That was a great experience,” Tarara said. “I
played with a really experienced club, so that
wasn’t as big a step as high school.”

Tarara also played softball in high school, but
says she’s “specializing” in her first love, vol-
leyball, at Pitt.

“I started playing volleyball in fifth grade,”
Tarara said. “It was a fun thing to do, and my
parents wanted me to experiment with different
sports.

“In seventh grade, I started playing for the
Sports Performance Club. That’s when volley-
ball kind of took over my life,” Tarara said,
only half jokingly. “I’ve been playing year-
round since seventh grade.” .

Playing year-round for so long has done little
to dampen Tarara’s tremendous enthusiasm for
the game. Even the slumps can turn into posi-
tive experience.

“I’ve always loved volleyball, but it gets frus-
trating sometimes,” Tarara said. ‘‘I think those
hard times have made it easier to get through
other things in life.”

Melanie Ishman also scored points ‘for the

Ellsworth was the standout performer
according to Sabol‘, who said that “she
maintained her place from a year ago with
three rno’re"tough teams in there.” He,
addféd that the women’s team showed
potential in the event, saying that “we

have women on our team that would be
solid performers on the top teams of the

Column-

rassing.

°LUST: ‘(to have intense
desire or need) Doe has
taken the form of the cheer-'
leaders’ new dance team,
and now the players pay
more attention to them dur-
ing time-outs than to what
the coaches are saying.

°ENVY: (painful or
resentful awareness of an
advantage enjoyed by anoth-
er) It has happened the last
seven games. Pitt had to
walk back to the locker
room while the other team
stayed on the field to cele-
brate. ‘

-WRATH: (strong venge-
ful anger) What more needs
to be said than injuries? Doe
has taken this form and
knocked out starters Billy

—West, Denorse Mosely,

Demetrius Harris, Reggie
Thomas, Tony Orlandini and
Dietrich Jells at some point
this season. This scheme has
highlighted the Panthers’
biggest weakness: depth.
There is one good note

about depth, however. Sean
Fitzgerald (#7), who began
last season as Pitt’s starting

. quarterback, is now listed as

the No. 2 punter behind ‘
Nate Cochran after kicker
Todd Barton went down
with a back injury.

With the way this season

has gone it’s evident that

Doehas firmly embedded
his psyche in the Pitt foot-
ball program.

Current Available Study Opportunities

Novum, Inc. is a research services company that conducts trials of both marketed and unmarketed medications for the pharmaceutical
industry. The types of studies undertaken at Novum include both new experimental medications and generic versions of already
marketed name-brand medications. Most studies require overnights stays in our facility in Pittsburgh. Also, taking an umnarketed
medication and having blood samples drawn is typical for most studies. A free physical examination, medical history, and laboratory
tests, including blood work, conﬁrm your eligibility for our studies. '

in further information about participation in clinical trials at Novum, please contact us at (412) 363-0400 or 1-800-756-5227.
