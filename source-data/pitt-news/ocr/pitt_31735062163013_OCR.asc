of pre-r,egistra'tion were .used as a

notllarge enough in many’ cases.”
He “explained, that several of the
English, Speech, Mathematics, and
languages courses had" over 40

"divided into smaller "classes.
’ U ‘ Rooms Too Small L

. Also several of the classrooms
were too small, although the num-

P  berof‘ students enrolled was not
.1‘ too large a number for one teach-
er to handle. Most of these classes,

will be moved to larger -areas.
' Martin also . explained that
thereare some classes that will
not be divided although they are
ggyery large.- As an example of

This department is ‘ conducting

' 7 four classes, each of which ‘is very

large, the largest having 110' stu-

Program ,

Established

Dr. Adolf Grumbaum

Named to New Post

Dr. Charles H. Peake, vice-
chancellor for the Academic Dis-

"ciplines, announced last Thursday

the establishment of a new pro-
gram in the philosophy of science.

“This program,” said Dr. Peake,
“is concerned with fundamental
conceptions of science, will involve
faculty members from many de-
partments and schools of the Uni-
versity, and will bring to the
campus through lectures, confer-
ences and symposia scholars from
other universities who are work-
ing in this field.”

A graduate degree program in-
cluding both the history and philo-
sophy of science will be devel-
oped. ,

Dr. Adolf Grunbaum, pro-
fessor of philosophy at Lehigh
University has been named pro-
fessor of philosophy and chair-
man of the program. He will
assume his new duties on Sept.
1, 1960. ' '

Dr. Grunbaum, a scholar in the

philosophy of science and author

of “The Philosophy of Space and
Time,” will offer an upper class

lecture course _in the philosophy of A

the natural sciences and a gradu-.
ate seminar in the philosophy of
space and time.

Dr. Grunbaum has held three
consecutive National S cience
Foundation research grants and a
Ford Foundation faculty -fellow-

_Ship, and has been awarded the

Princeton University J. Walker
Tomb Prize, as well as the Alfred
Noble Robinson Award from Le-
high. ‘ .

M*ARGARET’S
MAN

His grades at Eton were un-
impressive, and he later
flunked out of Cambridge.
(College men take note! This
is not a prerequisite for mar-
rying a Princess.)
Margaret, on the other hand,
has always been a beautiful,
charming rebel . . . with less
chance of falling in love than
any girl who has ever dreamed
of being a princess could
possibly imagine. ,

That: they found each other
in spite of themselves is the
basis for the most exciting
romance of this decade. Read,
for the first time, the real
story behind Princess Mar- .

On Edition F or Fall Trimester

The staff of “Ideas and Figures”
is presently producing the fall
edition. John Dawson, editor, ex-
plained, “This magazine is pri-
marily for students who write and
want to see their work in print,
and for those who do art work.”

_“In this way,” continued Daw-
son, “students have the oppor-
tunity to express their ideas to
others either in a literary or an

  
     
    
      

drawings, paintings, and sculp-
turing. In this way we are able
to get the variety of ideas and
styles that we want the maga-
zine to have.” '

“Since many of the staff has
graduated or is not enrolled this
trimester, we need new people to
work on the fall issue,” he con-
cluded.

 -Agreat weakness of the trimester system, often men-
ioned yet still unresolved‘, is the method of administering
 ‘al examinations‘.

_ 7"Since faculty members have a week less of teaching
~.ti,'rr1e, they are naturally anxious to leave the ﬁnal test until
he very last hour or two /of class. The result is that most
‘students have three exams,. some even four or ﬁve, in a
‘single day. . ‘

 Although administrators have stressed that under tri-
rrresters, ﬁnal exams are to be eliminated, or minimized in
mportance, thisisimply has not been the case. Many fac-
h,l't3L/m’ernbers have continued giving exams on. the-entire
term’s work-.' ’ ‘ r I ' . . _
 Even the Jconscientious student who has kept up with
“his, work during’ the term needs time to prepare ‘for
d""1'1'ch a test if he is to bring together the various facts and
_.d,e_as he has learned into a uniﬁed whole. T ’

 , ‘Furthermore, this method does not encourage students
..to-integrate the material they ‘have ‘covered in the course.
So, whichever system teachers us'e for testing a stu-

dication of what he has learned in a course, but also, he
/Vdoes‘not proﬁt as fully as he might from the course. . ..

-pthepﬁrst step in this direction would be for the administra-
i_’-tion to admit that this is a serious problem and to recognize
that a student cannotperform at his best when he has three,
our, or ﬁve tests’ in one day: L . _ A A
; 5 ’* So far, they have given little indication that they are
 aware of this. ' ’
It will not be .long until high schoolstudents and stu-
dents from other colleges learn of the failure of the tri-
 mester in this respect. Perhaps they will think twice-before
" enrolling at the University of Pittsburgh.
‘Even with all the advantages offered by the trimester
system, this one shortcoming couldprove to -be disastrous.

Communism End

By Nathan Firestone

I, Recent newspaper stories tell of riots in Korea.

These point out very clearly that our policy of sup-

porting an incumbent government, wheth’er ai dic-
tatorship or not, is deﬁnitel-yinot paying oﬂf. If

Syngman Rhee’s. government is nothing more

than a dictatorship. The fact

‘that he is a vehement anti-com-

munist ,is no excuse for -our sup-
porting him. A democratic South
Korea could be just as ant.i—com-
munist as Rhee-’s _government.
We had no chdice-but to.de-
fend South Korea‘in' 1950. But
could, have very v easily
warned ‘Rhee to-watch his step
after the 1953 armistice ~ was
declared. _ I A
And yet, our failuregto act

cost .us. For now, the national indignation‘ of South
Koreans is so great against Rhee’s government that
there is a real chance that South Korea could be-

come communist.

Aside from ‘the internal possibilities," this’ also
gives North Korea a good excuse" to attack South"
Korea. For the communists would like nothing’

My dear ‘Mr. Breakstone, you
are, indeed, “brilliantly misguid- '

college men and women,’ pre-
suming, I suppose, that educa-

'Editor,. The Pitt zxiéws:

Recently, a great many of us
who are now attending the third

‘trimester have undergone the

tedious. and ‘enervating experi-
ence‘ of ﬁnal examinations. '
I’m sure that none df us who
has had this experience is look-
ing forward to the inevitable
time in hot late July when we,
for the third time, -wil1'.be forc-

sleepless but crucial periods. s
‘ Granted, no ﬁnal examinations
in anylearning institution which
is on the semester system are
pleasant. Having“ attended ‘Pitt
while it was on the old semester
system, I can. verify this.-

But during the semester ﬁnals,

'1 never witnessed the use of »

dangerous ‘-‘stay awake” or tran-
quilizing drugs. -Now, they are
more than frequently used. This
is proof that the mental and
physical stamina of the average
student is being unduly strained.

The administration has thus

Jim Donahue is back on- the
track team, and the Panthers met
weekend success as they won
their ﬁrst dual meet of the season

and placed well in the Ohio Re-
lays on Saturday.

Co-Captains Mel Barnwell and
Ron Rush led the Panthers on Fri-
day by each capturing two ‘ﬁrsts.
Barnwell easily won the‘ 100 and
220-yard. dashes, while Rush
walked off with. one‘ and two mile‘
runs-

Not ‘Too Potent. V
ﬁA‘ccording to Coach Bobby

ewis Navy doesn‘t ‘appear to be
too potent. They do have a‘ left
handed pitcher that went 9-0 last
;year. Who the Midshipmen will
throw:-is a‘ question. Their right
elder is Fred Marsh, a power
ghitter who hit .500 last year. An-
other top performer is catcher’ Joe
'~B‘elino,' a Midshipman of football
fame.

The Panthers will go with

about the same lineup as they

, used in their weekend losses.
' I The lineup is as, follows:

P ‘ Despite the. Panthers five
straight losses, Lewis is confident
. that his Panthers will snap out of

their hitting slump. “We met too ‘
9-m-any strong teams too early,” I

‘Lewis commented. Maybe if the
Panthers had a more organized
"practice with more batting prac-‘
‘nice, they would‘ break out of the
slump.

 Suder did have four hits in
,1 the doubleheader and Ditka hit
_‘a ‘long triple, but there are

others who are unable to buy a ‘

hit. Since the Panthers meet a '

few weaker teams later this
4- week, the “power hitters” may
be able to make a few hitting '
_ bargains. \

r Another reason the Panthers
have been losing is their poor
pitching. Bob Conti hurt his arm

By JACK SIVIITH

IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIV

A ‘few weeks ago Chancellor Litchfield told over‘ 500 athletes
that athletics, winning teams, and individual attainment performed
an educational function.

If this is so then we ask ourselves the question: if an athlete

has the ability and desire to play two sports during the same season, 1 this week the Cats can bring

and there are no schedule conﬂicts, why not let him do it? Should
a winning team be placed.before the individual’s choice?

Since Jim Donahue attempted to take part_ in both track and
baseball, even the coaches are unable to agree on the two—sport—

K Last week, Jim Donahue, one of the Panthei-’s‘top sprint
men, decided he could ido justice to both sports. Track Coach
Carl Rees said that he ‘couldn’t' do a good job in track if. he
didn't come to practice every day.‘ Donahue was given the ulti— ~
matum of track or baseball.

Baseball Coach Bobby Lewis, not wanting to cause any con-
ﬂicts, promptly removed Donahue from the baseball ‘team. The
decision was left in the lap of Donahue. He is now back with
the track team.

There are other athletes who could have done the same thing.
Dan Kanell might have helped the basketball team along with being

the track team but he didn’t practice before the season,‘ so he was

About the only boy who hasn’t been questioned on participation is
Mike Ditka. - T
Although Ditkaywho plays basketball, football and baseball, does
not play two sports in the same season, his seasons do overlap. Some
coaches seem to let this ride, while others will not. excuse it.
i" This seems to be a question of policy for each individual
coach. It,’s each coach’s prerogative to set‘ the rules for his sport
-—~ rules that he feels are necessary in order to attain the best
.individual and team performances.

He has the right to say who will or will not perform. He sets‘
the hours of practice for team and individual. And he knows
what an athlete must do in‘ order to succeed. _

A point all coaches agree upon is that an athlete must make
certain sacriﬁces in order to succeed. Often an athlete must put
what is best for the team and others above'his individual choice.

/How many athletes are willing to pay the price it takes to reach
their athletic prowess. How much -work will a boy do to reach a
