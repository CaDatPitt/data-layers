4 e Dominican Teach - In 
Proposal Debated

By LEE SHEVKE and PETER HERMAN
(A letter to the editor on page four of today’s paper urges a
teach-in on the Dominican Republic in light of the success

»':-.__

 

of the Vietnam project.)

Latin American students at the University advocate a
teach-in on the Dominican Republic in order to better in-
form the student body on the situation there.

Fernando Romo, a. graduate student agreed with the ,

suggestion for a teach-in. “It will help to orient the stu-
dents here to the problem in the Dominican Republic.”

“More people will ‘learn from
a teach-in than from news’ arti-
cles,” said Ruben Espinosa. When

' asked if he thought the news-

papers treated the Dominican sit-
uation objectively, Espinosa noted
that many" people think the pa-

pers slant the news, but he felt"

that in general they give a good
picture. He said the ‘problem is
that most people do not get
enough information.

Adrian Zambrano, currently
studying English, felt that the
American people have an idea of

" the Latin American’s feelings. He

believed, however, that the teach-
in could help to clarify this idea.

Some members of the faculty
did not share the same enthusi-
asm for the teach-in.

Dr. Carl Beck, associate pro-
fessor of political science, felt

that if a national organization
would be willing to sponsor a
teach-in he would be willing to
participate, but expressed doubt
as to a national organization's
willingness to sponsor such an
affair.

Dr. Joel Sibley, associate pro-
fessor of history, felt the danger
is in Vietnam since it threatens
world peace; therefore, Vietnam
should be given priority. '

The Dominican Republic was
discussed Saturday, he observed,
and another teach-in would not
be necessary, but a discussion
with a group of Latin Americans
might prove proﬁtable. He ex-
pected the United States to pull
out of the Dominican Republic
any day now.”

Dr. William Boyer, associate

‘professor of political science,
commented thatla teach-in on the
Dominican Republic “would fo-
cus upon the whole Latin Amer-
ican spectrum.”

Boyte Gives
Noon Speech

HARRY G. BOYTE

Harry G, Boyte, special assis-
tant to Dr. Martin Luther King,
Jr., president of the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference
(SCLC), will deliver today’s Stu-
dent Union Board Midday ad-
dress, “The Imperative of a Re-
conciled Society,” at noon in the
Student Union Lower Lounge.

Boyte was invited by Dr. King
to join the ‘staff of the SCLC in
July of 1963 and was recently
requested to launch ,a new pro-
gram of reconciliation for the
organization.

An executive staff member of
the American National Red Cross
for 18 years, Boyte resigned from
the organization in 1958 so that
he might devote his time to the
struggle for Civil Rights.

Debates Crisis

By FRED FRANK

Dr. George M. K_a'hin of
Cornell University charged
_“American policy in Viet-
nam has been wrong from
the start,” at a national
teach-in on Vietnam, Satur-
day afternoon. ‘

The teach-in originating in
Washington, D. C., was transmit-
ted via a telephone system to
over 100 college campuses, in-
cluding the University. Costs for
transmission to the University
were paid for by faculty mem-
bers.

Students and members of the
community heard the transmis-
sion of the teach-in in the Stu-
dent Union Lower Lounge. There
were two speakers, each with a
complimentary panel of four peo-
ple. One speaker and panel fav-
ored United States Vietnamese
policy, the other opposed it.

McGeorge Bundy, special White
House assistant for national se-
curity aifairs, was scheduled to
speak for the group which fav-

ored U.s. policy, but had to with- '

draw at the last minute because
of other commitments.

Dr. Robert Scalapino, profes-
sor of political science at the
University of California at Berke-
ley, replaced Bundy.

Dr. Scalapino called the Viet-

namese situation “the most com-_

plex and grave crisis since World
War II.” He stressed the fact
that the Viet Cong are ruled by
the Communists.

“The National Liberation Front
and the Worker’s Party in the
North have no basic differences,”
Dr. Kahin claimed. He said the
Viet Cong are not truly an in-

Debate Seen
‘Scholarly’

By MARSHA REHNS

The University teach-in on
Vietnam, Saturday evening,
presented both pro-and anti-
Government speakers. They
briefly stated their stands,
gave information pertinent
to the Vietnam situation, and
answered questions from the
audience in five hours of
“scholarly debate.”

Consisting of five one-hour
sessions beginning at 8 p.m., the
teach-in was conducted in Tower
A Cafeteria and drew an over-
ﬂow crowd. Acording to Dr.
Robert Colodny, assosciate profes-
sor of history who spoke at the
last session, the teach-in pre-
sented “a set of alternatives to
newly aware students.”

Each session consisted of fa-
culty members from the Uni-
versity, Carnegie Institute of
Technolog, -and Duquesne Uni-
versity who spoke. in the form
of panels and then entertained
questions from the ﬂoor.

Speaking in the second session
Father Hoc of Duquesne Univer-
sity discussed the history of the
confict in Vietnam, as he, a

' Vietnamese, saw it.

He noted that there has long

. been conﬂict in his country, and
‘ he stated that his countrymen do

not want the United States to
pull out of Vietnam.

At Teach-In 

ByKAREN TOKAB

Most participants in Sat- i 
.urd-ay’s national teach-in - 

thought the program “went
off very well;” the turn out
was very good and the spirit
was constructive.”

Dr. Daniel S. Cheever, as-
sociate professor of interna-

tional affairs, felt that the" 0

“issues were very well ‘explored,  

and it is now up to the individ

uals to follow it up.” 

He stated that teach-ins are a
“good devise to gain understand-.
ing on any “momentus issue,”
and that Saturday’s teach-in was
a “tribute to students who show-
ed such an interest, and to the
participants, who gave their time
and knowledge.”

“Expert opinion camepoﬂ very
well,” said Dr. David Montgomery,
assistant professor of history.‘
“The points of view were well
presented and most people went
away with an understanding of
the situation—which was the
purpose of 1 ”

The teach-in was called be- -

cause of a particular emergency
at the moment, he added, hoping
that “there won't have to be any
more.”

Dr. Richard McCoy, associate
dean of the natural sciences,
thought the presentations were
“factual, effective, well-received,

and given by responsible sections

of the population.”

Demonstrators Protest

Proposed Sehna Plant  

Seven University students and four faculty members
joined 150 demonstrators in protesting. the Hammermill
Paper Company’s proposed expansion to Selma, Alabama.

The demonstrators carried signs and staged a sit-in
at the Erie, Pa. plant to pursuade the company to see their
representatives. The company agreed to speak to the pic-
keters, but obtained a court order to prevent the sit-in. The

police arrested several demon-
strators but the company did not
press charges.

An assistant to Dr. ‘Martin Lu-

ther King of the Southern Chris-'

tian Leadership Council (SCLC)
said that the company and the
demonstrators reached a “happy
agreemen .”

The demonstrators wanted the
company to exert all possible
pressure on Mayor Smytherman
and Sheriff Jinx Clark of Selma
to allow the registration of Ne-
gro voters. The company agreed
and assured the picketers that
Hammermill would continue its
fair hiring practices.

At present, the United Negro
Protest Committee (UNPC), Pitts-
burgh coordinator of the picket-

ing, plans no future demonstra-

tions. However, the UNPC will
meet again this Friday to consi-
der the Hammermill situation as
well as to investigate four com-
panies located in Pittsbfurghwith

An expert on French history
from Carnegie Tech, he delineat-
ed the history of the French in
Vietnam. Colonization of Viet-
nam by the French began in
the 1880’s he pointed out.

The French defeat Diam Bien
Phu led to the division of Viet-
nam in 1954. Elections were to
have taken place in 1956 but
this plan was never followed. It
was then that the United States
moved in as a “caretaker gov-

_ ernment,” he concluded.

Dr. Milton Fsman, professor

4 of public and international af-
~ mented that the U.S. was “four

years late in overthrowing the
Diem regime in 1963” and that
“its only recourse was considera-

ble involvement”.

Dr. Esman saw the establish-
ment of a “viable non-Com-
munist govemmen ” as the ob-
ject of U.S. presence in Vietnam.
The present bombing is to “pre-
vent the guerilla war from be-
coming a conventional war,” he
explained.

Commenting on the students,
Dr. McCoy said that he was
“proud of them. The students
were attentive,’ their behavior
was admirable and they asked
good questions.” _

He also felt that teach-ins
could be an effective mechanism
for full public debate on national

' issues; for they provide a student

with an exposure to more than
one idea. “This is a vital part
of education,” he added.

When asked if the teach-in’s
purpose was achieved, Father
Hoc, a Vitnamese priest from
Duquesne University, answered
that “the faces of the students

He criticized the Diem regime,

The Pitt News editorial of May 10 (“The

Teach-In-—A Trap for the Unwary”) was

a justiﬁed caveat, based on the evidence

‘then available. It warned of the potential

stumbling -‘blocks to impartiality; which

might appear. g
* Merrily Kodis’ column in the May 17

,.issue pointed out a contrasting, reprehens-
‘ ible reaction to teach-in preparations——one
ipwhich committed the elementary fallacies
 of guilt by association and condemning the
 origin. This sort of ad hominem reasoning
 cuts no intellectual ice.
5 g The University’s teach-in was a grati- -
 fying break from the tradition" which had
 engendered our qualms. What character-
 ized' this difference? The supply of histori-
- cal, socio-political, economic and military

information broadened the outlooks of all

.. present. The faculty’s awareness of their
—.- special duty to the students was part of it

also. Student maturity, responsibility ‘and
integrity constitute the rest of the differ-

’? ence.

A Lot of Bull

Old - Style Collegians
    By Nancy Delaney

The editors of The Pittsburgh Press were afraid we'd
be misunderstood; they ‘wanted to remind the public that
. not all college students were degenerate and profligate.
Their perceptive vision of the situation, their high intellec-
tual standards, and their commitment to involvement would
not allow them to sit by quietly and see us maligned. So in
a surge of concern they printed the following editorial in

’ last Friday’s Press, praising the
“old-style collegians” among us :

 

 vav...’im......  

“A news story from Char-
lottesville, Va., should reassure
Americans who have become
disgusted with college students
demanding that the
States abandon South Vietnam.

“Officials of the University
of Virginia were shocked the
other day to discover a Black
Angus bull on the dome of the‘
school's main building. Although
no one seems to know how the
V » bull got there, it is assumed
that students sneaked it up a narrow stairway.

“Somehow, it’s pleasant to realize that many college
students are more interested in old-fashioned pranks than
in advising the President on how to handle U. S. foreign
policy. These students, who obviously prefer anonymity,
are a refreshing contrast to the publicity-seeking delin-
‘ quents who have been posing for photographers in front of

_the White House.”

The editors of the Press ‘have set certain standards of

   

Vive Ia difference! .

Dr. Richard Cottam said at the teach-
in that he didn’t know w-hether to indulge
in’ pedagogy or polemics. It is fortunate

?that that distinction was so manifestly

drawn. The teach-in was no mere policy
condemnation‘, but a careful, complete study
of all -aspects of the situation.

Perhaps too many speakers had only

enough time to preface their concluding _

remarks. Perhaps we would be hard-put to
find those with changed opinions on U.S.
Vietnam policy because of the teach-in.

There now exists, though, a unanimity-

of opinion by all who were there as to the
value of the teach-in in the scholarly com-
muiiity’s quest for public debate and exam-
ination. of alternatives. '

Mr. Moreano’s point (see his letter to
the editor) is well taken. Asoften as the
teach-in concept can prove rewarding, then
let the dialogue continue. Whenever teach-
er and student want to communicate, we
say amen.

Ecuadorian

Editor, The Pitt News:

Pitt should be proud of its in-
tellectual standing among univer-
sities. This fact was clearly dem-
onstrated by last Saturday's
Teach-in on Vietnam.

When faculty members and
students can meet, and openly
discuss such delicate topics as
U.S. foreign policy—and some-
times oppose it-it only shows a
high degree of tolerance, open-
mindness and concern for world
affairs.

As one who was privileged to
attend the teach-in, and found
the eloquence of its panelists
quite stimulating, I would like

United

mittee for successfully organiz-
ing it.

As an Ecuadorian student at
Pitt, I hope that a “Teach-in on
the Dominican Republic” will
take place in the near future. I
am conﬁdent that it could also
prove enlightening to some of us,
and that in helping to clarify
some of.the basic issues, it could
promote better relations between
the United States and the Latin
American nations.

Editor, The Pitt News:

I should like to say ﬁrst, “No,
I’m deﬁnitely not a communist,”
and “Yes, I deﬁnitely am a pa-
triot." -

I suppose in a way it’s an hon-
or. Not everybody has been per-
sonally dressed down by the Vice-
President oil the U. S. (The Pitt
News, May 17, 1965.) My ﬁrst re-
action is to say my head is bloody
but unbowed.

In all seriousness, however, I
do not consider the Vice-Presi-
dent’s answer to me a personal
affront, nor did I mean my re-
marks to be personally offensive
to him. I toned my remarks in the
heat of give-and-take; and ‘he did
likewise.

Speaking for myself, I have al-
ways (and I do now) considered
the Vice-President a great Amer-
can liberal. Yet, nevertheless, I
can only regard with deep con-

advocacy of the current brutal

policy of America in Vietnam.
As for the others-—they un-
doubtedly buried any doubts _they
might have had in the ‘thunder
of their own applause._ This ap-
plause was for Humphrey’s elo-
quence, of which there was an
abundance, and not for the facts
presented which were, to say the
least, very dubious. For all those

with an open mind and with in-

tellectual honesty, I herewith
present a rebuttal to Humphrey’s
reply.-

First, let me repeat my ques-
tion. It has been sufficiently.mis-
quoted.

“Mr. Vice -President, if the
overwhelming majority of the

«Vietnamese people were sympa-

thetic to the Vietminh movement
how was the U.S. justiﬁed in re-
fusing to allow the election that
would have brought these people
to power? And when the Viet-
namese insisted on their own
form of government, how was
the U.S. justiﬁed in replying by
systematically killing them off or
in placing them in concentration
camps? Mr. Vice-President, how
do you reconcile your own liber-
alism to the utterly ghastly war
of barbarism we are waging
against the Vietnamese people?"
' Mr. Humphrey replied by say-
ing, “Boy, I'm glad you -asked
that question because now I'm
going to give it to you!" He then
proceeded to neither answer the
question nor to “give it to me.”
Instead he merely repeated the
same old discredited propagan-
da. He admitted the U.S. broke
the Geneva Agreement by not al-
lowing the election that was to
unify the country in 1956.

He said something about the
U.S. not being a party to the ac-
cord, but then in the same breath
he noted we had pledged to abide
by the terms therein. He then
talked aboutthe election of 1959,
noting the communists didn’t
participate. In 1959, there were
Diemist elections amidst Diemist
terror. That is why they were
generally boycotted.

Humphrey talked about the
American willingness to negoti-
ate. He said it’s the other side
that won't negotiate. Absurd. De
Gaulle has repeately insisted, as
have the 17 unaligned nations
(The New York Times) that the
other side will negotiate.

Remember this, there are cer-

     

x

 

try at war wouldn't publicly state
its desire to negotiate. Remem-
ber this too—De Gaulle has not

_yet been called a liar.

When Johnson comes on tele-
vision amidst a blare of trumpets
and says we are willing to “talk”
no strings attached, and then has
the State Department tell the
press what the strings are and
allows the Air Force and the
Navy at the exact same time to
bomb the living day lights out of
North Vietnam, I submit the
speech is strictly political and is
not intended in good faith.

Mr. Humphrey also noted that
neither India nor the other coun-
tries in the area want the _» U.S.
out. This is false. India, Burma,
Afghanistan, Pakistan, Cambodia
and Indonesia are all against
current American policy. Indeed,
U. Thant has urged an American
withdrawal from that “part of the
world.” ’ -

The Vice-President knows very
well that our present foreign po-
licy is causing a crisis in our re-
lations with practically every
single county—-even our NATO
allies. '

Now for the last point, the ter-
ror. Humphrey said the other
side has been coinmiting terror.’
He did not’ deny we are also do-.
ing so. He noted that various vil-
lage leaders have been assasin-
ated. Yet this is a reprisal terror.
It was begun after our lackey,
Diem, started an amazing terror
with his ascent to power in 1955.
This Diemist terror has been con-
tinued under the succession of
military regimes that have fol-
lowed him. ,

Now it may be that these acts
of barbarism are not done by’ us,
but rather by the Vietnamese
themselves. But are our hands
so lilly white? We hire these peo-
Ple. We train them, we pay them,
we lead them, and we ﬁre them.

If I've been rude to the Vice-
President, I apologize. But in
view of the absolutely Un-Amer-
ican atrocities our side has been
perpetrating, perhaps a little
rudeness is indicated. It seems
to me informed Americans should
now be angry rather than polite.

In conclusion, when the Vice-
President says some people should
know better, I should like to sug-
gest that he includes himself
among those people.

 NCAA playoff berths elude University athletic teams
as frequently as victories elude the Pittsburgh Pirates. The
‘A aseball team presents a current example.

e The season began with a surprising ten game win
streak. With the selection committee meeting this month,
-‘however, poor play ‘became dominant. It ‘seems like an in-
stinctive response. ’

SAINT .~ VINCENT took advantage. of six errors, beat-

 ii‘: the mitters in the ninth inning Monday. The victory
 was not a result of — St. Vincent's talent, but the baseball's
 team’s faulty play. -

First, the inﬁelders missed a hit over the pitcher’s

«if iimound. Then came an error by the shortstop, a hit bats-

man, and a stupid play by the pitcher. While chasing a run-
Brueckel

But the st. Vincent fiasco was only a‘ climax to the

 _ ‘ team’s poor play this month. Last _Wednesday, they coin-
j'*' f mitted three errors, losing a crucial game to West Vir-

- THEY BARELY edged California State, 6-5, last Tues-

 _ day, and Penn State graciously accepted two errors» and
 three walks May 9, winning the game in the ninth inning.

Their 13-3 record now seems little assurance for gain-

  ing a bid to the NCAA, and the mitters have also lost to

Penn State and West Virginia. . _ .
But the team remains staunch in its optimism, While

 lit flounders in the field. “We still have a real tight de-
 a. tense,” proclaims co-captain Barry Wetzel. “It Was just 3
" couple of games that our fielding faltered.”

CO-CAPTAIN Doug Chambers seems to expect the

 77s‘1idden slump. “It’s base-ball,” he said. “It’s just the Way‘
~   it happens. -We’re not falling apart by any means,” he con.-
 tinued, emphatically “We just made some mental and phys-

ical errors.” A _ _
;That’s all that has happened, _a few mental and physical

__ errors. Perhaps the whole team has been in a state of mental ‘
 unawareness the last two weeks.

V_ Hitting has been haphazard, and without Fred Mazurek
 it would be practically non-existent. Against West _Virginia

 they had 10 hits and lost. They usually have two or three
-men on base, but rarely are more than two or three runs
 _ scored.

“WE’RE NOT putting our hits together like in the

overpowering opponents with their hitting. Coach Bobby
  Lewis had called the hitting “adequate,” but the pitching

218 Oakland Ave. 2 Blocks Away

By RON -SIIEARER
About as many people see_
the inside of the Stadium in
the summer as see the in-
side of Forbes Field in the
winter. But Saturday sports
fans have an opportunity
not only to see the Stadium,

‘ but also the biggest attrac-

tion held there this summer.

The track team hosts" Notre
Dame and Penn State in what
should be an excellent array of
track talent.

“ Both Penn State and Notre Dame
have outstanding athletes from
Pennsylvania on their squads.
The Nittanys naturally are pre-
dominantly from the Keystone
State with 25 of a squad of 37
from Pennsylvania. Nine of the
37 are from the Pittsburgh area.
The Irish have half a dozen per--
formers from our state oil their
roster. '

There is a. good chance that as
many as one-third of the Stadium
track and ﬁeld records will fall
during the meet. Penn State's
Tom Bedick, originally from Cor-
aopolis, has already tied the Sta-
dium record in the -440-yard hur-
dles. He could possibly break the
record time of 52.6 seconds set
last year by John Balthea of Mor-
gan State.

Two other Staters, Lennart Hed-
mark and George Terza, will
probably better‘ Stadium records.
Both throw the ‘javelin, and are
aiming at the Stadium record of
222 feet and six inches. Hedmark,
who was recruited in Sweden,
has done 252 feet, and Terza has
gone beyond the 230 mark.

The Irish also have several po-
tential record breakers on their
squad, Two Philadelphia boys,
co-captain Bill Clark and Mike
Coffey, have already bettered, by
several seconds, the two mile rec-
ord of nine minutes and 20 sec-
onds.

At the IC4-.A meet last winter,
four Irish milers qualiﬁed for the
ﬁnals. The record of four minutes
and ten seconds could easily be
broken Saturday. Co-captain Bill
Boyle has done the quarter-mile
in 46.5 seconds, this being a. full
second better than the Stadium
record.

The tracksters are not without
their potential record breakers.
Sprinter Bill DelVecchio looms
the best chance to crack both
Stadium and University Varsity
records in the 100 and 220. In the
meet with Ohio University last

Tracksters Host Penn State,  
Notre Dame in Stadium Meet

  

JlMLAVALLEYwinssecondplace‘inhighjumpeventduringWest
Virginia. meet earlier this season.

week, DelVecchio was timed at
9.5 seconds for the 100-yard dash.
It would have been a school rec-
ord, but the judges awarded him
a time of 9.6 seconds, tying the
record. It was the third time this
year DelVecchio had run 9.6. _At
Morgantown, he ran the 220 in
21.6 seconds, just three.-tenths of
a second off the Stadium record.
DelVecchio is in top shape, and
with top competition from Boyle
of Notre Dame, he could be push-
ed to break the Stadium record.

Two-miler Dave Eiehenlaub has
been  with the school rec-

ord of nine minutes 23 seconds. ’

At the Penn Relays, he missed
by two-tenths of a. second. At
Morgantown, he ran 9:24. Tough
Saturday competition may also
help him break, the record.

~The tracksters need a win to
ﬁnish over the .500 percentage

.mark. Undoubtedly they will be

heavy underdogs to both strong
State and Notre Dame. Luddy
Hayden's absence makes this im-
perative.

He will test his leg later in
the week, but the prospects look
dim for his competing. The track-
sters only hope is that the Irish
and Penn State oifset each others
points so they can gain _a close
win.

3:! TOM SACKS

The baseball team faces a
last chance proposition at
West Virginia ‘today. If it
wins, it still might be offer-
ed a bid to_ the NCAA re-
gionals next week. If it los-
es, it will probably go no-
where. ' g

This desperation occurs despite
a highly respectable 13-3 record.
It has been caused by a comedy
of errors at St. Vincent last Mon-
day in which the mitters threw
away the ball game, 4-3.

The mitters committed six er-
rors, giving them 12 in last four
games, which is highly unfavor-
able for any NCAA hopeful. Most
of the damage; came in the bot-
tom of the ninth inning.

Lee Brueckel, who had ﬁve
wins before Monday, relieved Don
Stock earlier and had a 3-2 lead.
. The ﬁrst St. Vincent batter in
the bottom of the ninth popped

‘the ball right in‘ back of the

pitcher’s mound which no one
was able to reach. The following
hitter bunted ‘solidly to Bruckel,
who ﬁelded it and wheeled to
make the play at second, only

to see the umpire standing be-
tween the mound and second
base. .

He threw wide to evade the
umpire, but shortstop Steve Kienzl
was unable to hang onto the

. ball. The following batter was hit

by a pitched ball while attempt-
ing to bunt. The awarding of the
base was a judgement call on

"the part of the umpire, determin-

ing whether the pitch would have
been a strike or ball.

With bases loaded, the fourth
batter of the inning looped the

ball into shallow right ﬁeld with

Bill Bodle making a diving‘ catch.
In the meantime, the runner at
third tagged up and scored the
tying run. Brueckel struck out
the next man.

What followed is still unclear.
The runners at ﬁrst and second
attempted a double steal. One
runner was tied up between ﬁrst
and second, but in the mean-
time the other runner had scored.

The only bright spot Monday
was catcher Doug Chambers who
gathered four hits, increasing his
chances of being drafted in the
upcoming Major League draft.

downed the mitters 5-2 last week,
Coach Bobby Lewis plans to pitch
Brueckel. Since this is the Moun-
taineers’ last game of the season
pitcher John Radosevich is ex-
pected to make his ﬁnal appear-
ance. He beat the mitters last
week.

Tennismen Eye Good Year;
Try Youngstown T omorrow

Coach Ben Pope’s tennis team
eyes their best record in recent
years tomorrow at 3:30 p.m. when
they host Youngstown at the Car-
negie Tech courts. Saturday, they
travel to Grove City.

In the 1963 and 1964 seasons,
the tennismen won only one
match, while losing 22. The win
was last year against Duquesne.
But this yea1_;, the team has good

chances to compile a 4-9 mark.
“The boys felt conﬁdent of vic-
tory over Duquesne and Youngs-
town this week,” said Pope:
“Many years ago when the team
used the Pittsburgh Athletic As-
sociation (PAA) courts and had
the likes of Ed Jacobs (ranked
tenth nationally) and Doc Dave
0’Lough1in (Larry's father), this
school won more than it lost.

Parks anywhere

You can stand on your head looking Eoraplace
to park on most campuses. And all you end _
up with is a headache. But not if you ride a
Honda. It needs only as much elbow room as you with
an armload of books. So you can squeeze in a little closer

to that 8 o’clock class than your 4-wheel competition.

A Honda helps keep you solvent as well as sane. Prices
start about $2l5*.You’ll get up to 200 mpg, depending on
the model. And practically never need service. The
star performer above is the CB-160. Just one of the IS_
Honda models. With its 4-stroke, twin cylinder engine A
and 16.5 HP, this showoff does better than 80 mph. Look
intoa Honda soon. No more headaches.
