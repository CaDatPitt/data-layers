University of Pittsburgh

Enter Jefferson
Oratory Contest

University students will have an
opportunity to participate in the
Jefferson oratorical
contest which is being sponsored
by the Pittsburgh Sun Telegraph
and other Hearst newspapers. Con-
testants at the University will take
part in tryouts on the campus to-
morrow afternoon.

The citywide contest has been
divided into groups for high school
and college students. At the pres-
ent time all five Pittsburgh col-
leges are scheduled to take part.

Seven prizes will be offered in
the local college contest. Each
institution will choose its win-
ning contestant by March 15, and
during the following week the
local winner will be announced.

“Since there are seven prizes of.

'fered, a Pitt student has a good

chance of winning one,” said Dr.
Charles Lomas, director of Men's
Debate.

The subject of the oration is
“Thomas Jefferson, the Great
American” but the student may
talk on any phase of Jefferson's
life, if he so desires.

Winner of the local contest
will be sent to New York to com-
pote in the national contest. A
total of $1,250 will be awarded
to the national winner. In addi-
tion to the ﬁrst prize of $250 ‘in
war bonds given to the local win-
ner, the Sun-Telegraph will pay
all expenses of the trip to New
York.

Dr. Lomas and Miss Haun, di-

rector of the Women’s Speech As- '

sociation, are in charge of the Uni-
versity contest.

Red Cross Given

Dance Proceeds

Tickets are now on sale for the
Red Cross Victory Dance to be
presented in the main ballroom of
the William Penn Hotel on Friday
night at 9 o’clock.

Music for the dance will be fur-
nished by the Pitt Hi-Hatters. The
Hi-Hatters were formerly under
the direction of Jimmy Spitalny
who has recently been called into
the armed services.

The Victory Dance has been
planned to take the place of the
Heart Hop which has been can-
celled due to war-time conditions.

Dance chairman Robert Steyt-
ler, E45, has announced that all
proceeds from the dance will be
added to the student and faculty
contributions in making up the to-
tal University donation to the 10-
cal Red Cross. -

Tickets may be purchased at the
ground_ ﬂoor ticket booth or from
any committee member. Admission
is $1.50 tax included. —

“As a man who comes from the

have here. Out of a population of

way—-for his country and for his

"Greatest Mother Of All":  

Asks University Donations

   

Today and tomorrow the “Greatest Mother of All," the
Red Cross, will seek contributionsfrom each student and
faculty member so that the Unlversity goal of $1,200, double
last year’s total, may be reached.

Every class will be. addressed by student volunteer
speakers who will explain the procedure of collecting the

money. Brieﬂy stated it is as followsilt the beginning of

the class, the student will ex-
plain his mission and the pur-
pose of his solicitation. Then he
will distribute envelopes to every
member of the class.

They will be asked to contribute
as much as they feel obligated to.
The envelopes will then be collect-
ed and taken to the Red Cross dis-
tributing headquarters which are
located adjacent to the Dean of
Women’s office on the ﬁrst ﬂoor.

Each contributor will be given
a Red Cross lapel tag which will
signify to future solicitors that
he has contributed. .

A booth will be set up on the
ground floor to receive any dona-
tions from persons not contacted
and to sell tickets to the Red Cross
Victory dance scheduled for this
Friday night.

All Minno, C44, and Bettie Ka-
lish, Ed43, are the co-chairmen
aided by Betty Haldeman, BA43,
secretary; George Chirigos, C44,-
publicity director, and Mary Sar-
antopoulos. Ed43, and-Irving Lei-
ber, C44, in charge of speakers.

Commenting upon» the drive
Minno stated that “More than
ever now the country needs the
aid of the Red Cross. It can per-
form tasks that no other organ-
ization can accomplish, it can go
where others are prohibited, and
it can appeal and win where oth-
ers will fail. Both soldiers and
civilians need our help, and we
can’t let them down.”

Money from the Pitt donation
will augment Allegheny county’s
goal which is also double last
year’s goal and total $2,250,000.
The national aim is $125,000,000.

This year the Red Cross is conjfronted with a huge task,

 a task that calls upon every University student for aid in its

successful completion.

Today in every arena of wa.rfa.re, where Allied boys
ﬁght, the Red Cross is ever present. No other O1'gy1nlZa'Cl0ll

~ . of its kind in the world is better capable of handling this

xfital problem. Through its wo1'ke_rs in hospitals and stations
at home and abroad the Red Cross has aided approximately
1,500,000 service men and their families.

Nearly 3,000,000 pints of blood are being collected to
«save the lives of soldiers, sailors, and marines. Thousands
of American wounded already owe their lives to this great
project. Rest centers and clubs have been instituted where
American ﬁghters meet. Millions of knitted garments and
surgical dressings have been shipped overseas.

Prisoners of war have traditionally looked forward to
relief by the International Red Cross. More than a half mil-
lion food parcels and huge quantities of clothing have been
distributed to prisoners in the past two years of war.

At home the Red Cross has established production and
canteen corps, motor corps, medical health services, and
volunteer Nurses aides corps. These departments are work-
ing around the clock and touchingjn some manner, direct-
ly or indirectly, the life of virtually every individual.

The Red cross knows that this is an all out war. Millions
of American boys have been sent overseas and others will
follow. The Red Cross will be there to receive them. They
must be prepared. _ , .

It is in that process of preparation that we at" Pitt are
concerned. The Red‘ Cross is dependent upon "contributions
for the continuance of "its work. We, here atthe University,

~.Jn;ust make those contributions so that this work may-. go on.

The Red Cross is going all out andwe must ‘use this op-

I I This Thursday, March 1, at 12:30,
o’clock, Flight Commander Hall of

' the Royal Air Force will address‘

all engineering and mines students
in the Stephen Foster Memorial.
He will discuss the work and ex-
ploits of the RAF. Dean E. A.
Holbrook announces that all fourth
hour classes in the engineering and
mines school only, will be excused
so as to attend the general meet-
Thc Engineering and Mines
Cabinet, acting under the advice
of Dean‘ Holbrook. has announc-
ed that the Engineers’ Lounge
will definitely remain in State
‘Hall. Probabilities are that the
‘Engineering School may be mov-
ed hack to the Cathedral of
Learning on or about the month
of May.
; There are some misleading rum-
ors on campus concerning the draft
Status of engineering and mines
students not in R.O.T.C. or inany
of the other enlisted reserves. Of’-

. ﬁcial word issuing from the Dean’s
_ oﬁice will clarify the situation. “In

spite of all rumors to the cont1'ar_\j.
there has notbeen any oﬁicial gov-

]: ernment' 'cl1a‘nge in the draft status
of thesophomores, juniors, or sen-

iors enrolled in the Engineer-ing and

 - Mines‘ School.

lective .. Service; Gil¢~}‘!_l.fOp{§£ .: ‘cert—i~fi'- .

   
 

cation from the Dean's office.”
The Dean repo'rted.that of the
165 students that graduated in Jan-
uary, 40 per cent entered the arm-'
ed services and 60 per cent became
engaged in vital and necessary war
industries or in government posi-
tions. This disproves the theory
that the bulk of the engineering
graduates enter the armed serv-
ices. At the present there are 651
engineering students of which 40
are in the Anny Enlisted Reserve
and 61 in the Naval Reserve. About
400 are on draft deferred status

and will remain such as long as

their scliolastic standing merits
their cleferment. Thus the Dean,
who was recently made National
Chairman of the Committee of
Student Relationship of the Ameri-

can Institute of Mining and Metal—' .

liirgical "Fug-ineering, has attempt-
ed to make clear the position of‘
the engineering student.

The professors and instructors
of State Hall have deﬁnitely re-
ported that at least one change
has taken place in the last few"
weeks, “The women are more
noisy than .the rambling engi-
neers." Any reply, girls?

alaflcey Leading Scorer; T

bodice-Captain Artman Second

Co-Captains Bob Artman and Tay Malarkey proved to be

5-the scoring as well as theifield leaders of the Carlson bas-

lteteers according to the ﬁgures just released.
Malarkey led the team in scoring honors with a total of

‘ 182 pointsscored in some 15 ga.n1eg,

__ ,_ Malarkey, who ﬁnally fulﬁlled several years of promise,
had a remarkably good season throughout. Perhaps his high
point came during the second Pitt-Geneva, game when he
scored 26 po1nts——just a ‘few short of the all time Pitt high
scoring record. This was also the first season that Malarkey
completed. Heretofore illness, and family hard luck had pre-
vented him from ﬁnishing any one campaign.

Bobby, Artm-an was second with 164 points. His best
score came in the second game with Carnegie Tech when
he notched 21 points. The other Panthers were far he-
hlnd their captains. V“Troublesh0oter” Steve Zernich was a
poor third with 67 points. Swacus was next with 66 and Loli-
meyer with 64. Walt Jones managed some 59 points, Lloyd
Carlson 42, a.n_d Ed LaTagliatta 36.

_ Walt Jones was first in the personal foul department
with 42 called on him. Artman was second with 36 and Lob-
meyer third with 34. Artman, perhaps, had the best record
‘for making foul shots. He scored 34. times out of 42 chances.
Malarkey broke even with  out of 102, being the most fre-
:quently offended memberof the Pitt team. '

Pitt women have lost no time in

taking up the popular pastime ol
howling for both recreation and ex-

ercise. Last Wednesday, Senior
Court defeated WSGA in a trial
game.

This was more or less a pre-

training period for the lntcr—0r-
ganization Tournament. This com-
petition will give each organiza-
tion an opportunity to play "every
team entered ‘into the tournament
at one time or another.

There will be no eliminations.
The team winning the most games
at the end of the period of compe-
tition will be declared the winner.
The captain of each respective
"team will be responsible for get-
ting her members to compete with
their opponent during the particu-
lar week scheduled for the game.

lt is through the captains of each
organization that Ruth Mendoza,
bowling manager, will make con-
tact. With last Friday as the dead-
line for howling teams, the organ-
izat-ions are now ready to be no-
tiﬁed. _ V
t Rules forithe tournament games:

Nleet Team Candidates

Sliauglinessy
Explains The "T"

Head grid mentor Clark Shangh-
nessy was greeted by 45 candidates
for the \;arsity eleven at last
Thu1'sday‘s meeting in the Stadium
dressing rooms. Rather than devot-
ing the meeting to the making of
deﬁnite plans, the master of the
“T” formation held a more-o1‘—le.~:<
“get-ac«;uainted” aliair.

After being introduced to the ath-
letes by A.-;sistant Coach (.‘harle‘s
(Doc) Hartwig, Shaughnessy en-
lightened the aspirants as to his
style of play. Present plans indi-
cate an abandonment of spring
trainingsessions and the install-
ment of mid—summer practice.

. Of the 45 candidates, 37 were
varsity or freslnnen footballers last
season and eight were men that
have never tried for the squad be-
fore." Seven or eight of those pres-
ent at ’Thursday’s meeting will be
called into the services soon.‘

* A quicli survey showsithat t-he
Jungle Cats will suffer the similar»

fate of all other teams in. collegiate .. '
circles and be riddled by service ‘

calls. The make-up of next season’s
team seems to center about four

physical rejects, two advanced den- V ‘

tal ',studVent_s. and twofreshmen who
will stillbe under the draft age
next , selnester. If Pitt drops the_
freshmen rule for the duration, the
squad will be bolstered by students
enrolling in the University for th
fall term. ’

Another possibility for adding to‘
the Panther squad would be from
Naval recruits. The Navy. depart-
ment has approved Pitt for a pos-
sible contract for basic training in
the Navy College Program. The
Panthers may, therefore, get some
talented gridders as the Navy per-
mits varsity competition for its
students.

Students Surprised, Cadets
Pleased As Clip-Joint Opens

You can blame all that racket you’ve been hearing on the
ground ﬂoor on the new barber shop for the cadets.

, If you want a strictly GI haircut, 45c and a khaki uni-

form will do the trick. Cadets using the new barber shop, are

..very pleased. “In Atlantic City, the haircuts were short and

sweet, emphasis on the short,” said one of the soldiers.
The new “glamour” shop which is open from 2 :30 o’clock

to 9 o’clock, follows the govern-
ment regulation, leaving the hair
only 1% inches long. The Ci-
cero brothers, who operate this
and seven barbershops at the She-
nango Army camp, say that these
cadets are a nice bunch of fellows
‘and that it is a pleasure to work
with them.

' The shop, which opened Wednes-
day afternoon, .gives the fellows
real bargains, 45c for a haircut,
25c for a shave, 10c for a shoe-
‘shine, and only 20c for a good dose
of hair tonic. Catering exclusively
to army personnel, the shop will
not trim any civilian students.
Cadet Paul Gunn of Boston

told us that the previous Atlani
tic City haircuts looked like a
lawn-mower minus one blade had
been used for the shearing. Some
boys in the barbershop broke
away from their quartette long
enough to say that there had
been a mad rush of volunteers
for guard duty at Pitt. They
want to see what the Cathedral
looks like from the outside. and
what kind of women the Univer-
sity boasts.

The modern, white~walled shop
on the ground ﬂoor trims four at
a time, although they usually come
in bunches of 20 or more. “If
you’re on the ground ﬂoor and see
a bunch of cadets frothing at the
mouths, don't get excited and turn
inthe nearest .ﬁre alarm. They’re
probably just refugees from the
barbershop,” the barber concluded.
