4th Hour Classes Out
For TapDayFete May6

The weatherman is doing his best to bring good weather

for Tap Day May 6.

Clear skies mean that the annual event will be held on
the lawn between the Cathedral and Heinz Chapel. In case
of rain, Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall is slated.

In either case, all classes will 9

be dismissed at 11:10 a.m. Fourth
hour classes will not convene so
that students may attend Tap
Day ceremonies, which begin
promptly at 11:20 a.m.
Old and new will be combined
in the yearly program honoring

students outstanding in extra-cur-
ricular activities. '
_ Climaxing the program will
be the ODK award, made to the
outstanding senior man, and the
announcement of Senior Queen
and Alma Mater.
' Spoon Dipped
Oldest of the traditional cere-
monies is the “Dipping of the
Spoon,” begun in 1872. Then, it
signiﬁed that spoon-fed discipline
“was unnecessary for upperc1ass-
men.” Now, “Dipping of the
Spoon” honors junior men and
women who give promise of lead-
ership for their senior year. Tap-
pees are known as junior worthies.
Brand new ‘in this year’s Tap
Day will be the awarding of a spe-
cial service award to an outstand-
ing-senior member of Alpha Phi

Omega, national service fraternity.
Composed of former Boy Scouts,
the fraternity was founded at Pitt
in 1927. Members pledge them-
selves to serve the youth of the
community, the school, the nation,
and scouting.
New Feature

Another new feature of Tap Day
will be the tapping of members to
Delta Sigma Rho, honorary foren-
sic society. Tappees are those who

have had four semesters of college,
are in the upper one-third of their
class, have participated in inter-
collegiate debate or discussion, and
have made an outstanding contri-
bution in forensics.

Customary Tap Day events will
include the tapping of Cwens,
sophomores women’s honorary.
Ten per cent of the freshman girls
are tapped.

Druids, sophomore men’s leader-
ship honorary, will name mem-
bers. The Druid award, given to
one outstanding sophomore man,
will be made.

it ‘Better Campus Life’ Cited
1, i As Reason for Lawn Buildings

By JOHN De NINNO
"Pitt students apparently disagree with the “building
code” recently formulated -by the Board of Trustees pro-
hibiting new buildings on campus. ‘
’ An-eight—to-one ratio of students polled felt new build-

ingsshould be built here on thelawn‘. Four administration
members also agreed with the stu-% .

’ dents. .

_ The controversy over new build-
ings onthe Cathedral lawn arose
last week when Alan M. Scaife,
president of the board of trustees,
said, “There will never be any
more buildings on the lawn than
there are now. This feeling does
not conﬁne itself to the trustees
but also is felt among alumni.”

New Buildings Needed

This statement coincided with
‘an ‘announcement "by Chancellor
Rufus H. Fitzgerald, that Pitt
needed a Student Union, library,
dormitories and new science hall to

. attract students from a "wider area.

At the time, the Chancellor re-
gretted the lack of adequate land
for these new buildings.

Most of the students favoring.
structures on the lawn thought
that such buildings would bring

. about better campus life. The
students who opposed more
buildings on the lawn felt that

“a In Industry
aﬂ Nearing Goal

District industries pledged to
donate $7,500,000 to Pitt’s medical
center have almost reached their
goal.

Alan M. Scaife, president of the
board of Trustees, made the an-
nouncement at a dinner at Mellon
Institute Monday night.

So far $6,177,000 has been sub-
scribed to help pay for the newly
planned buildings to house the
medica land nursing schools, he
said.

He called the grants a “meas-
ure of industrial support to pri-
vate‘ medical education without
parallel anywhere else in the
country.”

3 Objective of the current fund-
raising program for building pur-
poses is ten million dollars, of
‘which two mililon is on hand from
previous campaigns.

Dr. Dusenberry, who spent -two summers working in

the national archives in Mexico,¢
found that this was only one of

the diﬁerences between Mexico
and the United States.

He had little trouble, for exam-
ple, in obtaining an interview with
Mexico’s Secretary of Agriculture.
“No formality or red tape,” he
says. “I just walked -in.”

Visited Palace

Although he worked six days
out of the week down there; Dr.
Dusenberry traveled to nearby re-
sort towns on Sundays. In Cuer-p
nava, a resort town 40, miles south
of Mexico City, he visted the for-
mer palace of the conqueror Cor-

The two-story stone building is

used as a museum now. One of the
most spectacular sights was the
Floating Gardens at Xochimilco.
_ The gardens are actually huge

of all varieties. For a small fee,
the tourist can sail past these ﬂoat-

a “very eﬁicient Indian boy.”

In smaller boats, groups of six

She left before they came; what
she has heard about them is
enough to satisfy her that they are
not her idea oft“nice people.”
Know No‘Other

She explained that the reason
China’s younger set has accepted
Communism, is that they have
known no other form,of govern-
ment. The Communists h av e
thrown open" the doors of China’s
universities to anyone they deem
worthy to enter. Of course they
are taught Communist doctrines,
she said.

She cited an example of the at-

Although the Communistsdo not

In connection with this point, the A ,

Spanish-speaking instructor added
that much of the color of the West
has its source in Mexican cattle
ranching. The slang for cowboy,
“buckaroo,” is derived from the
Spanish word “vaquero.” ‘ '

Mexico has its troubles as well
as its virtues. The political situa-
tion, according to Dr. Dusenberry,
is shaky. There is alwa_ys'a chance
for revolution. '

poverty is prevalent. “They talk
about democracy,” he says, “but
they don’t practice it.” He noted,
too, that the Russian Embassy was

A apathy. in the recent all-campus elections when many posts
. on the student governing bodies were ﬁlled by men and
Qwomen who were insured of being elected for the simple
I reason that no one else was running for the position. There
- were also cases_ in the men’s ~-class oiﬁcers elections where
’='several positions had no aspirants. -

-. “For perhaps the same and other reasons ‘as well, two~
of the highest positions on Inter-Fraternity Council and
- Student} Congress were taken over by students who were
— elected ‘unanimously. Rumors of coalitions and secret deals
.~ circulated and the News carried an editorial column that
 some members of .these governing bodies could actually sit
back and write their acceptance speeches for the executive
positions for which they were running. We are not trying.
' to say that the best people were not elected. We are not
trying to say that the best people were not elected to the
« leadership positions they now hold. We are trying to say that
. . when people are elected unopposed to the presidency and
vice-presidency of two top governing bodies on campus,
‘ then student government is fast falling into the farcical
- stage. P *

_,  It is hard to believe that only one student in this vast

-—University had the qualities judged to_ be those most de-
" sirable in selecting a future leader of a top organization;
_ and -harder still to succeed here to the belief that this stu-'
V .dent was the only one. desiring to enter the race for Stu-
, dent Congress president. The same holds true for the SC’
‘ ». secondary post and the two leading positions on IF Coun-
 cil.‘_.If we are to_believe this, than we must admit that stu- ,
. '-dent government at Pitt is prostrate oppressed by a most. -
, unhealthy situation. A functioning, powerful government
is the ‘goal of all colleges and one that is achieved by feW.'_
 When we are faced with such alpitiful spirit of competition,
or else the equally appalling prospect of being governed by
a master political_ machine, then we are truly at the stage

where -student government is little more than a toy for
irecognition—minded glory-hounds. In words of one sylla-
ble: This is not good. It ‘stinks! .

In the Spring issue of the Panther, on sale

whetheror not ‘communists should be allowed to"

they serve '.Russian"‘ rather than United States in-

terests. ,
The difference of opinion be-

tween Mr. Berger, who argues

that communists‘ should be per-
mitted, to teach, and Mr. Dicken-
son, who‘ takes the opposite view-
point, arises from a different set
of basic “ assumptions.” I

Dhuamioon Leads
 Polio Battle Here

   

By GEORGE SALILI

(This is the last of a series "discussing the work of Pitt?s virus re-

search team.)

Control-of paralytic polio at present depends on the use
of gamma globu1in—a ﬁeld inwhich Pitt’-s Dr. William Mc-
Dowell Hammon plays a leading -role. S '

developed vaccine,._.the coming

about infantile paralysis. _It has;
been -‘determined th'at"lp‘olio is

separate’ viruses are ‘responsible
for the disease. It has also been

_established that many people have
"had the.three types. of polio with

these‘ people are’ now immune to .

the recurrence of the polio’ type
with which they had, been infect-
ed; The most pertinent data cen-
tered around the discovery that

~-thebloodstream contains disease-

ﬁghting antibodies capable of pre-
venting the polio virus from
reaching the nervous system

' (brain and spinal cord) and thus

preventing paralysis.
Determine Proper Time
The problem was to determine

"the proper time for immunization.

Early in "1952, Dr. Dorothy Horst-
mann of Yale and Dr. David Bod-
ian of Johns Hopkins found that
the polio virus, after entering the
body through the mouth, ‘stays in’
the bloodstream for a few days

before. attacking the nervous sys- - -

tern. This break of a few days pro-

vided the oportunity for im-
mllnization.
Drs. Horstmann and Bodian

used monkeys for the experiment
in the development of the present
effective GG inoculations. Mon-
keys were infected with polio vir-
uses. - Then while the ‘‘ infection
was working toward the ne_rvou_s
system, some of the trial» animals

-were given GG shots. These ani-
_mals did not become, paralyzed.

Other monkeys infected with’ the
same -viruses but not given gamma
globulin were paralyzed within
ten to 15 days. -
, Children Tested

This set the stage for GG tests
on p o 1 i o~- stricken children in"
which Dr. Hammon ﬁgured so

prominently. In the summer of i

1,952, Dr. Hammon led a ﬁeld re-

search team into the polio epi— .

demic areas of Texas, Utah and
Iowa. With‘ GG given by the
American Red Cross and with the
National Foundation for Infantile
Paralysis donating over a million
and a half dollars, 55,000*children
were given gamma globulin shots.
The tests were deﬁnitely success-
ful, and GG was proved an effec-
tive deterrent to paralytic polio.
For his work in this ﬁeld, Dr.
Hammon was cited with the’ Jun-
ior Chamber of Commerce medi-
cine award in 1952. '

Doc's No-I-litter
May Be First

By BORIS WEINSTEIN
Sports Editor

 

_ Too bad that Doc Shanafelt can’t rest on the laurels
of a_no-hit, no-run game, but Sarge,Mitterling’s slim pitch-
ing staﬁ demands that the strong righthander bask in the
gloryof that game only for’ a"_short while. ‘ ,
, Shanafelt, along with Dick Shannon, make up what Sarge
calls “a good college pitching pair ” but after this pair the
rest of the staﬁ must be labeled  -- -------- "
“doubtful.” _.
Shannon proved his
worth "last week with an ef-
fective ﬁve-hit performance
against a veteran West Vir-
ginia team. Not to be un-
done, Doc took the _mound
two days later and refused
to allow a single hit to Gene-
‘va; winning 5-0. He also con-
tributed two doubles to drive
— in th_ree runs.

“It was the ﬁrst time since
I.came here in 1938,” Sarge re.-
calls,_” that any of, my pitchers
threw a no—hitter. I’m not sure
if it was ever done before that
time.”

Actually, it wasn’t the type of
no-hitter ,which produced super— _
human ﬁelding" plays or dramatic bench strategy”

 

   
   

“I knew ‘I1 was

’working’on it since the fourth inning,” Doc said,‘ “and I just kept

bearing down to stay ahead.”~ ,
He certainly did just that, _too.rDoc walked only two Covies
and hit one batsmen. The outﬁeld handled a minimum of chances
and Catcher Milt Emery was credited with ten putouts vie strike-
» outs. , . p
‘ In the inﬁeld three possible basehits were .wiped out by Third
Baseman Dick Lepkowski and Shortstop Rudy Filek. Lepkowski
charged a dribbler early in the game to rob one batsmen and Filek
kept the no—hitter alive with graceful gems in the ﬁfth and ninth
innings.
On his ﬁrst try Rudy backhanded a shot, in the hole and pushed

the ball to Joe Scalzo at second for a force out. In the ﬁnal inning

with a runner on ﬁrst Filek gloved a line drive and doubled the
runner at ﬁrst base. \ _

Not to take anything away from -his terriﬁc game Shana-
felt was working against a team that was playing ‘only its sec-
ond game. He, therefore, overpowered opposing hitters who re-
sponded rather weakly to his deliveries. 

On the other hand,»Doc was working under, a handicap, too.
From the ﬁrst game of the season against the Atlantic Amphibs, he
has been bothered with a sore back. “It was my ‘ﬁrst day ‘on a
mound,” Shanafelt remembered,, “and I wasn’t used to pitching
there.” He pitched a ﬁve-hitter \that time but a few days later

' against Ohio University he was knocked off the slab.

\

  

Last Friday’s game was a. comeback of sorts, but what a way
to impress the coach! 0 . ’

for a game with the Middies.

By WILL HLIVKO ~

Riding the crest of a ﬁve-game? winning streak, Pitt’s
diamond Panthers start playing, as Coach Ralph Mitterling
puts it, “the tough ones"‘ when they visit Annapolis Friday

  

  

Mitterling 93 High-Flying Diamond   

Nine Prepares for “Tough Ones’

Sarge inferred that in winning their last ﬁve games, the

Panthers have played rather “easy” teams. He -warned,

however, that Navy and the teams who follow are loaded.

“We’ll- need the best hitting we
can muster if we hope to beat
Navy on Friday,” Mitterling con-
tinued. “I’m going tov‘pitch Doc
Shanafelt against Navy because
he’s our best hitting pitcher.” .

A. And he isn’t a bad pitcher,
either. In his last outing, Shana-
felt carved himself a niche in Pitt’s
Hall of" Fame by chukking a no-
hitter Friday as the Mittmen col-
lared Geneva, 5-0. ’

Mitterling will also be depend-
ing on three batters currently hit-
ting over the .300 mark. Harry
Little, sophomore centerﬁelder, has
taken over as the team’s leading
batter hitting at a .357 clip. Little
"added seven points to his average
during the past week. ’

Other Panthers hitting over the
.300 mark are Sam Rago (.333)
and Bob Kyle (.316). Rago hiked
his mark up 23 points during the
last two games. Kyle, on the other
hand, dropped 51 points but man-
aged to stay in the charmed circle.

Dick Lepkowski was the only

other Panther to fatten his average
during the past week. The lanky
third baseman collected two hits
in six trips to add eight points to
his average and is currently hit-
ting .289. .

Rather disappointing this season
has been two of last season’s lusty
stickmen, Ollie Niemela and Milt
Emery. Niemela has dropped to
.229, while Emery, leading in RBIs,
owns an anemic average of .184.

Little added eight points to his

Pitt’s netmen will rest until Fri-

(3-2) at Lewisburg.

This match will tipbﬁ -a gruel-
ling schedule of six matches in
nine days for the Panthers.

Gene Weinstein, Dave Litch-
man, Harry Duncan and Larry
Mikoleit chipped in singles wins
in the triumph over the Moun-
taineers. The undefeated duo of
Weinstein-Litchman also won
stretching its streak to two
straight in a hard 4-6, 6-2, 6-3
victory.

Dick Dye, Mountaineer number In
