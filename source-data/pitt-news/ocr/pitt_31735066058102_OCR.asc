Shuttle routes not changing, yet

By Mark Gordon
News Assistant

Pitt shuttles will continue to provide service to
the Shadyside/Squirrel Hill area until at least the

end of the term.

An article in this week’s Carnegie-Mellon

/ University newspaper, The Tartan, had reported

that as of Jan. 1, the Pitt shuttle system will be
taken over by the Port Authority Transit System.

According to administration officials, the story

H is incorrect.

“The reality is, Pitt service to Shadyside and

mer,” said Robert Harkins, director of parking

and transportation at Pitt.

Ken Service, Pitt’s director of communications,

Squirrel Hill is to remain as it is until the sum-

and Leon Haley, vice chancellor for student and
public affairs, also said the article in the CMU
paper was wrong.

“As far as I know, that story was incorrect,”
Service said. “The Pitt buses will be able to pro-
vide transportation past the first of the year.”

“There is no truth to that article,” Haley said.

Student Government Board President-electﬂ

4 Julie Crowell said besides the story being factual-
ly incorrect, she was also misquoted in the story.

Take your valuables
home during break

By Chris Lombardo
and Tawnya Adams

' Lh_e£I£NeWS

A great holiday break could
be ruined if you’re not careful.

Many students caught up in
the holi-day excitement leave
campus forgetting to take the
measures necessary to protect
their valuables and some find
their possessions gone when
they retum.

Assistant Director of Public
Safety Gary Moses advised stu-
dents that “when they leave for
home, take stereos, TVs, CDs,
computers, jewelry, all money
and credit car .”

“Take small valuables home
and make sure doors are
locked,” Moses said. “Students
should let their roommates
know when they are leaving so
the last one to leave can make

sure the door is locked.”

A new service, which started
last spring, is being run by the
Business Services Warehouse
located at 480 Melwood Avenue
in North Oakland. They are
renting crates to students so they
can store items if they don’t
want to take them home. ,

, “There are four sizes of recep-
tacles students can rent,” said
business warehouse spokes-
woman, Carie Voda. “The
smallest is 4x4x3 and it costs
$15 a month.” The sizes and
costs go up from this along with
an insurance fee of $1.50 plus
tax.
The warehouse has to rent the
storage boxes monthly, even if
students only need them for two
weeks. Students must deliver
and pick-up their stored items
— delivery service is not avail-

Center provides sluc/enfs
more access to Japan

By Amy Fink
Staff Writer

The Japan Center for
Intercultural Communication
in Tokyo recently agreed to
establish a Japanese
Information Satellite Center

at the University of
Pittsburgh, in the East Asian
Library. -

“The new Japan

Information Center will pro-
vide rapid, easy access to a
wide array of Japanese gov-
ernment documents, econom-
ic reports and other data on
Japan in English,” said
Jonathon Wolff, associate
director of Pitt’s Asian
Studies Program.

Information that has not
been published is available
through the J CIC.

According to Sachie
Noguchi, Japanese bibliogra-
pher and cataloger of the
East Asian Library, a student
may need recently collected
statistics of a certain topic
that may not be published yet
but can be made available
through the J CIC.

“Without this service, you
would have to know some-
one in the ministry, get
weekly bulletins mailed or
wait a year for published sta-
tistics,” said Noguchi. “This
allows a question to be trans-
fered directly to JCIC and
quickly answered. Typical

Japan, in the vanguard age
of global development, has
developed this electronic
information network that
stretches around the globe.

In the United States there
are currently three satellite
information centers. The
fourth information center
will be here at the university.
The others are located at the
University of Michigan,
Earlham College and the
Japan Center of Tennessee at
Middle Tennessee State.

According to Wolff, of the
Asian Studies program, the
satellite information center is
completely funded by the
JCIC located in Tokyo. The
University of Pittsburgh is
only providing a site. JCIC
chose the university because
it already has an extensive
East Asian research collec-
tion.

“This is not just another
academic tool, it is to pro-
vide fast and accurate infor-
mation to the entire region
on Japan,” said Wolff. “For
the academic and business
communities, this is an
incredible resource. The
J CIC provides information at
a deeper level to a broader
audience.”

“Much more information is
available on a large scale,
and you can ask an unlimited
amount of questions,”
Noguchi said.

Task force looks of Pifl's
cultural environment

By Anthony Breznican
For The Pitt News

Students who don’t think
there is enough cultural diver-
sity on the Pitt campus should
check out the recent report by
the Chancellor’s Diversity
Task Force.

In 1993, Chancellor J.
Dennis O’Connor and a group
of senior advisors assembled
a group of “individuals from
around campus who had
demonstrated scholastic and
community leadership” to
investigate the cultural envi-
ronment of Pitt and set goals
and strategies to make it a
more culturally diverse cam-
pus.

Five subcommittees were
set up, each to tackle such
issues as community on cam-
pus, curriculum on campus,
student representation, faculty
representation and staff repre-
sentation. The report
states “[the] groups on cam-
pus who may experience dis-
crimination, harassment or
exclusion are African-
Americans, women, gay men
and lesbians, foreign students
(especially those from Africa,
Asia and Latin America), per-
sons with disabilities, Jews
and Muslims.”

The report said one goal of
the task force is dealing with
causes of conﬂict and stress,
such as prejudice and racism

at itself and with tolerance
and understanding at all oth-
ers.”

Other goals of the subcom-
mittees are to develop a cur-
riculum more suited for an
increasingly multi-cultural
society, to recruit and gradu-
ate “African-American and
other underrepresented under-
graduate, graduate and pro-
fessional students,” and also
toincrease the number of
“underrepresented minority
and women” in the faculty, as
well as in the university staff.

Because of the fairly recent
formation of the Task Force,
its inﬂuence is still growing.

“I foresee a very active year
ahead for us,” said subcom-
mittee chair Julius Youngner.

Two goals of the force for
the future are “to share in the
role of leading advocate for
multiculturalism,” as the
report states, and “to involve
all of the elements of the uni-
versity, including the board of
trustees, administrators, fac-
ulty, staff and students in a
continuing and deepening
understanding of diversity.”

“I don’t think [the task
force] is an issue of inequali-
ty as much as it is a universi-
ty-wide coordinated commit-
ment that begins with the
chancellor,” said sub-commit-
tee chair Betsy Porter. “There
are a lot of people recogniz-
ing that this is very important

Catena said students study-
ing late in Forbes Quad will be
asked to move to one of the
designated areas.

A special ﬁnals week shuttle
is being run to get students to
and from the late-night study
areas on campus, according to
Michelle Moore of Pitt’s
Office of Parking and
Transportation.

The shuttle will run on a 30-
minute loop from Sunday, Dec.
11, through Thursday, Dec. 15.
It will make stops at the
William Pitt Union driveway,
the front entrance to Hillman
Library, the Bigelow
Boulevard bus shelter near the
Cathedral of Learning, the
fourth ﬂoor entrance to Scaife
Hall and the main entrance to
Benedum Hall.

The ﬁnals week shuttle will
run from 7 p.m. to 3 a.m.
Students can receive schedules
for the shuttle from any bus or
shuttle driver or at the informa-
tion desk in the William Pitt
Union.

In addition to running the
ﬁnals shuttle, hours on several
regular shuttles during finals
week have been extended.

The Campus Shuttle, North
Oakland, South Oakland,
Shadyside and Squirrel Hill

shuttles will run until 3 a.m.-

Moses said campus police
will patrol the Towers and other
dormitories located in the center
of campus on a 24-hour basis.
Outer-campus dorms will be
patrolled on a 16-hour schedule
during break. Off-campus stu-
dents are susceptible to break-
ins also. They often live in
buildings with little or no secu-
rity options. Some suggestions
for off-campus students include
making sure all windows and
doors are locked and the locks
are in proper working order.
Also, bring as many valuables
with you as possible, or store
them in a well-locked room or
closet. If possible, have a neigh-
bor collect your mail.

“I leave several lights on
while I’m away and even ask
my neighbors who will be here
during break to check on my
place. I take as much home with
me as possible,” said off-cam-
pus resident Laurie Kupec.

Recycle

-From page 1

the group is hopeful a good
example will be set for the
entire student body to follow.

Resident assistants will be
taught how to properly recycle
on campus, and that informa-
tion will be passed down to
residents during hall meetings
and activities.

“The RSA has a good, orga-
nized structure for reaching
students,” said Dave Homyak,
advisor to RSA. The main
problem with recycling in res-
idence halls is contamination
— nonrecyclable materials
thrown in recycling bins.

Hornyak said teaching stu-
dents just what can be recy-
cled and where will help to
strengthen the current program
while new measures are being
explored.

RSA has formed the
Resident Hall Recycling
Coalition, a subcommittee that
hopes to serve as a liaison
between resident students and

administration on recycling
issues, according to RSA
President Andy Miller.

“Together with SEAC and
the other groups involved, this
committee plans to vastly
improve recycling in the
dorms. That includes getting a
recycling contract for hous-
ing,” said RSA Treasurer
Sarah Moss.

Currently, University
Housing, which operates sepa-
rately from the rest of the uni-
versity, does not have a con-
tract with a recycler, but the
rest of the university does.

Plans in the near future
include another Recycle Week
next semester, similar to previ-
ous ones, but with more
emphasis on education and
recruitment of students willing
to work on improving recy-
cling. I

“Our main objective right
now is education. Most stu-

dents aren’t aware of how to -

recycle. We must make the
recycling program easy to fol-
low and use,” said SEAC
member Mike Kaizar.

Some measures have
already been taken to improve
the current system.

Housing Support Services
has started repainting many
recycling bins to make them
more visible, and is consider-
ing new ways to make their
shape and location more
attractive to recyclers — for
instance: having bins that
look entirely different from
regular trash cans, having lids
put on aluminum can bins
with holes only big enough
for those cans, creating a
campus—wide color code sys-
tem that makes it easy to
understand what materials
should go in each bin and
placing these containers in
high traffic, high visibility
areas around campus.

Other issues being dis-
cussed include newspaper
bins to recycle old papers
such as The Pitt News and the
future possibility of recycling
glass products.

Opinions

The Pitt News

Thursday, December 8, 1994

From the home office

Well this is it ladies and gentlemen, the last issue-of The
Pitt News for 1994. The Opinions desk would like to take this
opportunity to give thanks to those various groups who
helped in the production of our editorials.

1. The Republican Party: all the stupid things they said and
did provided us with ample editorial topics.

2. President Bill Clinton and the Democratic Party: see #1.

3. The Bosnian Serbs: their ruthless dismantling of Bosnia
and crimes against humanity allowed us to freely express our
moral indignation.

4. Libertarianism: if you have not figured it out yet, we
want to legalize everything.

5. Harris Wofford and Rick Santorum: they provided the
ideal balance between a statesman who is not really a politi-
cian and a fascist pig. ,

6. Haiti: what moreneeds to be said.

7. Fraternities: gotta love ‘em.

8. Pitt sports: anemia is a good thing.

9. Did I mention the Republican party?

10. SGB: see #8.

11. The New York Times: an invaluable asset.

12. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette: something to be used
when the Times is unavailable.

All of these groups have greatly helped us in writing our
editorials this semester. Of course there are others who have
provided contributions, but there simply is not room to name
them all; however, we thank them anyway.

On a more personal note, I (i.e. Tom Stein, the guy who
writes all these nifty editorials) am being exiled to an island
nation. There is a changing of the guard, a coup d’etat, a rev-
olution, a radical shifting of editorial styles in the Opinions
section for next semester. Seriously, I am going to Oxford to
be an American expatriate, and my ennobled colleague, last
year’s editor Ben Jackson,«will attempt to fill my size 13
shoes with his big feet. 9

Moving right along, there are some things to watch for in
1995 — it should be an interesting year. First of all in the
realm of politics, watch out for factionalization within the
Republican Party as they try and lead the nation (even though
they do not control the presidency) and as rabid presidential
candidates, hoping to capitalize on Clinton’s collapsing presi-
dency, cut each other to pieces. As for Big Bill himself, he
will make yet another try at being the “comeback kid.” Of
course he failed miserably in the November elections, but the
future is the undiscovered country — anything could happen.

Now as for Europe, hopefully it will not blow up. The
chances of that have actually been minimized by Ukraine’s
willingness to give up nuclear weapons and which allows for
the implementation of START 1. However, the overall out-
look for Europe is rather gloomy. The Bosnian situation has
caused much disarray, and NATO is becoming even more
anemic than Pitt sports. 1995 will likely see this disarray con-
tinue.

Otherwise the world will probably stay pretty much the
same. The 49ers will be the first team to win five Super
Bowls, and baseball will eventually be played again. Good
luck with finals, and have a great break!

Convenience store

In response to your editori-
al concerning student reaction
to the recent Meal Plan policy
limiting students to one block
per person per day in the
Residence Hall Convenience
Store —— the Department of
Food Services wishes to clar-
ify the situation.

We realize that our timing
in notifying students of this
policy caught them off guard,
and we understand that many
students are concerned about
being able to use all of their
Meal Plan BLOCKS before
the end of the term. While we
are willing to assume some
responsibility for this occur-
rence, many students must
also accept responsibility for
managing (or mis-managing)
their BLOCKS. »

We have authorized Marriot
to begin a “BLOCK Party”
program at Eddie’s Food
Court so that students can go
there to quickly dump their
BLOCKS. Students may
spend BLOCKs for two bulk
items (i.e., cases of products)
at Eddie’s from Dec. 6-14.
This is a one-time program
only and will not be repeat-
ed in the spring term.

We have increased the limi-
tation of the C-Store BLOCK
purchases to two BLOCKs
per person per day. This poli-
cy will remain in effect
through the Spring Term.

We started accepting
BLOCKS at the Convenience
Store as a student conve-
nience —— for purchasing
snacks —- not as an “alter-

nate meal plan” or for large '

bulk purchases of items. The
whole/sale dumping of
BLOCKs at the C-Store not
only goes against the original
intent of the ﬂexible Meal
Plan, it is also not sustainable
in any business or financial
sense — to put it bluntly, we
simply cannot afford to oper-

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

 

ate that way!

The Pitt BLOCK Meal Plan
is designed to be one of the
most, if not the most, pro-
gressive university meal pro-
grams in the country. (If any-
one knows of a plan that is
more progressive, we would
love to hear about it!) We
have tried to create the best
of all possible worlds in
terms of meal plan ﬂexibility
and creativity, in hopes of
offering students these ser-
vices and still breaking even.
But being an innovator can
have its drawbacks, and we
may have to make some
adjustments along the way.

Alcohol abuse

First, I commend The Pitt
News staff for running the
recent series addressing alco-
hol abuse on campus.
Alcohol abuse is a serious
concern on college campuses,
and your serious treatment of
the issue provides a valuable
service to students. I do,
however, have a couple of
clarifications to add to your
story.

The University of
Pittsburgh has an extensive
history of efforts addressing
alcohol and other drug prob-
lems on our campus. The
Substance Abuse Prevention
Programs offered through the
Student Health Service date
over 10 years. These pro-
grams are offered under the
umbrella of the Health
Education Office (in exis-
tence for over”2O years) that
offers comprehensive health
promotion programs to all
27,000 students in the univer-
sity. Many schools both local-
ly and nationally look to our
program as a resource and a
model for their institutions.
Many other university depart-
ments and organizations offer

.__.....

counseling, education or
alternative activities for stu-
dents, as well.

Is there room for improve-
ment? As a member of the
ad—Hoc Campus Task Force
on Alcohol Abuse, I am oper-
ating on that assumption. I
believe that all the members
of the task force will examine
current practices, programs
and resources at the universi-
ty to determine how we can
most effectively respond to
alcohol abuse. Please do not
prejudge or underestimate
current efforts on this campus
to combat substance abuse
without fully investigating
those efforts.

Barge was right

It seems that R. Dodge
missed an important point in
his extremely angry letter
addressed to Michael S.
Barge. It may be true that
Stephen Foster was a musical
genius, even that based ‘upon
his achievements, a statue
created in his honor isn’t such
a bad thing.

But the point here is, why
would a submissive Negro be
included in the statue? If a
Negro had influenced
Foster's songwriting,
wouldn't it seem sensible to
display the helpmate in a less
derogatory position? Surely,
no one could have come into
a college education without
learning interpretive skills.
The statue degrades Negroes.
This is the point. Perhaps if
R. Dodge was willing to lis-
ten to a different interpreta-
tion of ideas, he might find a
more appropriate place to
unleash his rage.

DECEMBER 31994 ,   3 L

 

by
John B-
lvloore

My back against the cold brick wall,
I scan the crowd at Graffiti, pondering
the eternal question: is there more to
the Pittsburgh music scene than
Rusted Root?

Brownie Mary, playing to a sold-out
audience to celebrate the release of
their new CD, take the stage a little
after 11 p.m. A barefooted Kelsey
Barber walks out followed by the other
three members. Judging by the torn
jeans and perfectly distressed T—-

shirts, I expect the worse. Good kids E

trying to look bad. There’s no safer
rebellion than strapping on a guitar.
Within minutes l’m floored.

It's a mistake to judge this band by
image alone. Looking like kids with
unlimited credit at The Gap, all precon-
ceived notions are dispelled by the first
song.

The stripped-down sound of bass,
guitar and drums remained constant,
despite a few lame attempts at special
effects. The gelled lights flickering in
tempo were reminiscent of a late ‘70s
Kiss show. Even more absurd was the
dry ice machine under the drums which
enveloped Steve Kazinski. To his cred-
it, he continued to pound away, giving
‘off the look and sound of a Civil War
drummer boy lost in the swamps of
Louisiana.

Beers in hand, the animated concert-
goers followed the music word for word
from originals to covers, the enthusi-
asm peaking at “Coconuts,” a song
combining Jimmy Buffett-esque lyrics
with a ska sound. (Kind of a

meshed well with guitarist Rich
Jacques’ low-key stage presence. (He
stood in relatively the same spot,
throwing off riff upon layered riff with
the nonchalant presence of Clapton.)

I was a little weary, hearing the first
few cords of Joplin’s “Freedom” during
the final encore, fearing a sacrificial
slaughter. But the tension quickly dis-
pelled when Barber put her own signa-
ture on the song, not falling back on
the breathless moans only Janis could
pull off.

Playing together for barely a year,
you wouldn't suspect that Brownie
Mary quite has what it takes to revolu-
tionize the music scene here. But they
have the talent, the potential and the
songs that few other ‘Burgh bands can

played together as a folk duo.
Upon graduation, they dropped

that they were looking for a drummer

and bass player. Enter Kazinski and

Marks.

With half the quartet coming from out
of state and no real history of consis-
tent national success for musicians in
this area, why start a band here?.

“Pittsburgh’s just the rock and roll
capital of the world,” deadpanned
Marks. “Pittsburgh is a good breeding
ground,” he added seriously. “lf you
can bring people into clubs in
Pittsburgh, then you’re doing good.”

Jacques is quick to add that the
music scene in Pittsburgh is starting to
pick up with
bands like The
Clarks and the
aforementioned

Bass player Mike Marks played the
crowd like open mike night at the
Comedy Store, sending out one-liners
between songs, and even playing a
few lines of "Summer Loving” from
“Grease” as Kelsey Barber took a
break from singing to crouch behind
the drum set and put on a T—shirt.

self-confessed world beaters Rusted
Root. Within months, they had entered
and won the 1994 Graffiti Bud Lite
Rock Challenge.

The earliest incarnation of Brownie
Mary began at West Virginia's Bethany

And while crit-
ics around town are doling out positive
reviews for the disc and shows, they
are constantly trying to push the music
into one genre or the next — drawing
parallels to musicians like Tracy
Chapman, 10,000 Maniacs, Edie
Brickell and Juliana Hatfield.

‘‘I think they probably compare us to
those bands because we have a girl
singer,” said Jacques. “Other than that,

l don’t know if we really sound too
much like them.”

In describing their sound, Marks and
Jacques use terms like alternative, pop
and rock, which are brave enough
labels considering their influences are
as diverse as a Benetton commercial.
Marks admits to listening to everything
from metal to early Prince. “We all lis-
ten to different stuff. You go through
one of our tape collections, you’re
going to find just about anything.”

Granted it’s a little easy to write the
band off as another version of 10,000
Maniacs just because a female holds
the mike, but the disc does tend to
soften the band's live sound. The dis-
tortion quelled to the point that the
record can simply be filed under pop.

Live, there’s no question Brownie
Mary —— their moniker taken from an

elderly woman who made pot brownies E

for cancer and AIDS patients —— could
hold their own in front of any audience,
be it deadheads or metalheads — a
selection not that unrealistic consider-
ing those who shelled out five bucks a
piece at their CD release party last
month. I witnessed every form of fan

from a cowboy-hatted couple to Doc

Marten—c|ad boys and girls all stream-
ing into the club —— until Graffiti was
filled to capacity.

A year ago Brownie Mary plugged in
at the same venue for their first public
appearance with this line up. “You
can’t imagine how good this feels,”
exclaimed Barber, looking out at the
mass lucky enough to get in before the
doors were shut, giving the band a
sense of how far they’ve come.

Seeing as how many will refuse to
listen after spotting a flyer making them
out to be poster children for a middle-
class Generation X — benefits come to
those with an open mind. Those foolish
enough to base musical taste on sight
alone only leave more tickets available
for everyone else. After three hours of
Brownie Mary, there's little doubt that
they could lead the next wave of music
on the Pittsburgh scene, giving the
public an alternative to garage bands
and world beat wannabes.

Catch Brownie Mary this week for
free. They'll be playing an acoustic set
today at Oasis music on Forbes Ave.
around noon.

writes, “As embodied by
Tommy Lee Jones, Cobb is an
abusive, irascible, trigger-
happy megalomaniac who
slugs bourbon for breakfast
and, for a nightcap, injects his
gut with insulin to pass out.”
Sound like Ty? You bet. Ty
was often thought of as the
biggest bastard in baseball, a
violent racist, but also one of
the greatest hitters of all-time.
Yet, it'll be interesting to dis-
cover how much screen time
is devoted to Cobb's career
since the story is told in flash-
back and set 30 years after he
retired.

Mrs. Parker and the
Vicious Circle. Continuing in
the spirit of revisiting our old

 

heroes, Alan Rudolph (The
Modems) directs a biopic set
in the early ‘20s, at the begin-
ning of Dorothy Parker’s
career (Jennifer Jason Leigh).
A glib journalist, prolific wit
and member of the huge
Algonquin roundtable, Parker
soared as a successful writer
in an old-boy town. However,

* Leigh has received criticism

for her speech, which some
critics believe to be off
Parker’s boisterous mark. Still,
Mrs. Parker should be an
amply charismatic flick about a
much more likeable person
than Ty Cobb.

Love and a .45. Described
by Peter Travers as a cross
between Reservoir Dogs and
Midnight Cowboy (whatever
that means?), Love and a .45
may provide just the trashy
aesthetic of cinegore that we
missed in Natural Born Killers
due to Stone’s didacticism. Or
maybe it'll just be trash. Like
NBK, we follow two white-
trash youngsters, Watty and
Starlene (Gil Bellows and
Renee Zellweger), bang-bang-
ing their way across the
Southwest. Director C. M.
Talkington has them get mar-
ried, kill cops and become
media darlings.

Immortal Beloved. Gary
Oldman finds another musi-
cian to play, although he'll
always be our dear ole Sid

gone from punk to something

WE NEED YOUR HELP IN A
“STAND BY ME” CASE

Our law firm represents a college
student who was seriously and
permanently injured on or near the
railroad tracks that run through Panther
Hollow, near the CMU and Pitt
campuses. Our client had been walking
along these tracks, which run from
downtown Pittsburgh to the CMU
campus, when the accident occurred.
The accident happened on the bridge
that crosses over Boundary Street, in
Greenfield, (near BIG _]1M'S
RESTAURANT). *

The railroad denies knowledge of
people walking on or near the tracks. If
you have ever walked along or used
these tracks in such a fashion, or if
you are aware of people walking on
or near these tracks, please call

hit am’t real no more.
That’s right, I said it and you
know I’m right. After this past
holiday and weekend, I've
seen enough. I think the kap-
per for me was when I found
out that BONE (Thugs in har-
mony) went platinum (that's

right platinum), and they only.

released one single. What
kinda shit is that? How can a
group from the East Coast
(Cleveland) do West Coast
music, not say a damn thing
lyrically and go platinum? To
me, the state of hip-hop is in
trouble. What happened to the
days of when things were
real?

How many people can
remember where they were
when they first heard Eric B. is
President, or for that matter
the Bridge Is Over. That was
real live and uncut, no gim-
micks. That music hit you in
three spots: one, the wallet
because after you heard it you
had to own it; two, the tape
deck or turntable because you
had to hear the joint at least
once or twice a day; and
three, it hit you in the head
because you always had to
remember the words. I mean
how many of us still know the
words to Children’s Story and
go crazy when its played at a
party and hit the dance floor?
I’m sorry, Spice 1 just doesn’t
do it to anyone. Besides, he’s
too interested in puttin’ a cap
in some,body’s ass, instead of
getting them hype. ,

Check it. I got a few opin-
ions from some heads who
basically feel the same way as
I do, Blakk Steel and O-
Money. So yo, tell the people
what you two heads think
about the state of hip-hop
today and who's keepin’ it real
and who isn’t.

O-Money: I think it's in recov-
ery. It was a good year for hip-
hop. The East Coast came
back after being in the shad-
ow of the West Coast's com-
mercial success.

Blakk Steel: East Coast was
always phatter, but West,

back in effect. I’m just sorry it took me so
long to get back in the swing of. things.
The theme of this article is going to be 
mad props. Why? Because there are a lot
of props to go around for the year of
1994. Since the second‘ half of ‘94 has
been prosperous for phat music, we’II
condense the album list to the top 10 and
give those 10 their props. Since no one
took time to call and leave their votes on
my audix, I compiled the list myself; so
don’t get upset if your favorite rap
artist/group is not included. What was the
sleeper of the year? What’s the super sin-
gle of the year? Keep reading to find out.
Now I wanna start issuin’ props.

Mad props to NSBE, Delta Sigma
Theta and Sigma Gamma Rho for
stickin’ diehard with a brother and givin’
me the opportunity to get my hustle on
(even though SGR’s party didn’t happen).
Mad props to those who decided that $3
was too much to waste on trying to look
cute and actually started dancing and
stopped letting good music go to waste.
Mad props to Phi Beta Sigma for wakin’
up and comin’ back home; they’re givin’
me a chance to represent once again this
Friday for the true final jam before we
take those exams. Props to O-Money for
finally getting the simulcast together,
because we’re gonna broadcast this one
as well. Crazy mad props to my crew and
staff at Underground Hip Hop Video
Magazine; from no love to mo’ love, from

. Bil/board nominations to write-ups in The

Source, to other offers comin’ our way.
I’m glad I was made apart of it. Madmad

I mad props to my main shit stain Bobbito

(of Stretch Armstrong & Bobbito - WKCR,
NY) for the worldwide buzz given to my
radio show in Vibe Magazine earlier this
year; I can't thank you enough because
you truly helped to set shit off. One love.

Mad props to the people that gave me
my true props and flooded me with tape
requests for the old shit; you’ll have them

blukk steel

after you get back from X-mas break.
Mad props to my WPTS staff for makin’ it
easy on me while I'm the station manager
(for the most part). Props to my trainees
(Briz, Dacia, Monica, DeeTee, Chris,
Ronika, G-Ball) for keepin’ shit real when
I graduate in April. Mad props to Bill for
letting me ramble on in his paper. Mad
props to those who have been down
since day one and stayed true; too many
to name, but they know who they are. To
my crews The P-Dub (Psycho Ward) and
Last Man for keepin’ my back and Iettin’
me know that I’m never solo as long as
there’s a phone handy; crew ‘til we part.
Rounding this off, never last, nowhere
near least, to my Boo; you keep me
together when Western Psych has a room
with my name on it. What more can I say
but  I love you.

   

The Top 10 albums were comprised of
albums that were more than 50 percent
dope (mostly my opinion). Since I had
trouble placing these‘ in an order, I'll give
them to you and you can arrange them to
yo’ delph. Remember, these are not in
numerical order: «

1. Redman - Dare lz A Dark Side: The
funkadelic rebel continues on a funk-
Iaden journey to a place called “hell and
beyond.j’ Produced mostly by Redman
himself, this album picks up where the
last left off in dopeness. (check
“RockafeIla,” “Noorotic,” “Cosmic
S|op,” “We Run NY”)

2. Keith Murray - The Most
Beautifullest Thing In This World:
Representin’ from Central Islip, Long
Island, this brother first caught wreck with
his producer, Erick Sermon. With his
debut single still blazin’, Keith and the Def
Squad show where the funk and the hits
are comin’ from. (“How’s That,”
“Escapism,” “Syschomatic”)

base of the old dynasty the Juice Crew)
spawned their representative for ‘94 in the
form of an angry 20-year-old with a
“chipped-tooth smile” and a surreal style

of rhyme. In terms of anticipation, Nas ‘

was to ‘94 what Snoop was to '93. (“NY
State Of Mind,” “The World Is Yours,”
“Represent,” “Memory Lane”)

4. The Notorious B.I.G. - Ready To
Die: From winning The Source’s
Unsigned Hype artist a couple of years
back, to the Who's The Man soundtrack,
“DoIIy My Baby” and other various
cameos, this brother who’s still under the
legal drinking age is sending veterans
and new jacks alike away from this pro-
fession. (“Suicidal Thoughts,” “Ready
To Die,” “Gimme The Loot,” “The
What”)

5. Craig Mack - Project: Funk Da
World: From carrying bags for EPMD, to
having his bags carried, this brother from
Brentwood, Long Island, poured “flava in
ya ear” and made rappers revamp their‘
skills and learn to become true emcees.
(“Flava In Ya Ear,” “That Y’aIl,” “When
God Comes,” “Get Down”)

6. Common Sense - Resurrection:
Everyone looked past the first album‘
because his remixes were the dopest.,
Since this album is still relatively new,j
you’d be dead wrong to sleep on this one.
From beginning hiss to the ending analog
code, this album is so butter that he;
should wear a blue bonnet.f
(“Communism,” “I Used To Love“
H.E.R.,” “Chapter 13,” “In My Own
World”)

7. Artifacts - Between A Rock and A
Hard Place: Another potential sleeper. I
heard this album when they completed it
last November. Rhymes: tight. Beatszi
phat. References: Tame One is
Redman’s cousin and El The Sensai is?
his peeps. Home: Newark, NJ. Style: lyri-A
cal graffiti on wax. -Synopsis: true repre-
sentation. (“Flexi Wit Tha Tech,”
“Wrong Side Of The Tracks,” “Comin’
Thru Ya Fuckin’ Block”)

It was 8 a.m., and yawns
interrupted our phone call, but I
managed to get the gist of
Homecoming. Thank you
nappy for your nappiness.

Homecoming is part three of
the Kentucky Cycle, which was
written by Robert Schenkkan
and spans 200 years. It won a
Pulitzer Prize in '92, so what's
great about it?

The cycle includes nine sto-
ries that follow the lives and
journeys of three families
whose lives intertwine. It might
not sound appetizing, but the
meat of the play is absolutely
delicious.

Homecoming follows the
Ftowens and the Talbert fami-
lies, touching on their relation-
ship but focusing more on the
ups and downs they encounter.

“People who are tied to the
land, they have to live with the
land, and the land is an impor-
tant aspect to the play,’’ said
Brian Byrnes, zee direktor.

ty, more so than morality.

This drama of acting for
necessity definitely relates to
our lives, so don’t tell me you
think it sounds drab ‘cause it’s
your life. S

I don’t think it’s too wrong to
act out of necessity or survival,
but Byrnes stressed that these
characters are pretty much dri-
ven by necessity. Sooooo, I'm
waiting to see how I will relate
to these people and under-
stand their world.

“To apply our morality to
their actions is difficult. They
live in a different time [1792],
their morality and consequen-
tial actions are necessary for
the time they live in," said
Byrnes backwards.

Where? Where? Where is

cast has really brought a truth-
fulness to the text which
demands a great deal of hon-
esty.” Work.

Residential Suite
Hotel X
SST

Using two bassists in a band
presents a challenge to the
musicians. The low end
sounds of the two instruments
run the risk of tripping over
each other; or both can end up
playing the exact same thing,
rendering a two-fisted attack
redundant.

Hotel X, a funk jazz quartet
from Virginia, uses the two
thunderbroom approach in a
way that gives the music a
new spin. While Ron Curry’s
fretted bass anchors the
grooves, Tim Harding’s fret-
less axe functions as a melod-
ic instrument, often doubling J.
Ghaphery’s alto lines. And
both cats double on horns half
the time, Curry on trombone
and Harding on alto. .

Residential Suite, the band's
second album, proves that
Hotel X can lay down some
serious bop of their own as
well as leave their signature
on some ambitious cover

tunes. Their readings of

'3'.“ ».Q,g!',4 V

Blood Ulmer, Material and
Count Basie show off their
record-collections as well as
their penchant for tight
arrangements. Several tunes
add extra horns or percussion
to the brew. This works espe-
cially well on Materia|’s already
fat-bottomed “Work Song”
where trumpeter Jon Mela
joins Harding and Ghaphery on
the frontline.

“Sent For You Yesterday”
closes the album with Harding
and drummer Jim Thomson
stepping up to the mike to sing.
Their performance ain't as
tough as Jimmy “Mr. Five-by-
Five” Rushing’s in the original
Basie recording, but it has the
same swingin’ spirit.

While their debut album
came up short in the way of
original material, Ghaphery
and Harding penned some
solid tracks for Residential
Suite. The songs pit simple but
direct horn lines over 'whoop-
ass grooves. It's easy to make

“Player's Ball’’)

9. Slick Rick - Behind Bars:
The ruler has come back to
regain his crown to make up
for the very disappointing The
RuIer's Back. With smooth
grooves and tight lyrics, Slick
truly comes correct on this
album. (“Behind Bars,” “Cuz

Down”)

10. Jeru The Damaja - The
Sun Rises In The East This
kid from Brooklyn showed the
true power of the underground.
Self-released at first, his major
debut lives up to the expecta-
tion of a DJ Premier produc-
tion. The “sun-toucher”

more people coming back to
the reality and real flavor,
which is tight lyrics, raw beats
with actual drum tracks and
crazy ill metaphors that put rap
on the map in the first place.

O-Money: I think we're finally
getting out of the “era of the
keyboard.” Like Blakk said,
we're getting back into the real
style of hip-hop with a new
group of real M.C.’s like Craig
Mack, Notorius B.l.G., Nas,
Keith Murray and Redman. We
can’t forget the brothers on the

alike, but little subtleties and
instrumentation shifts give
each one their own mark.

On “Funky Broad Street,”
Harding shows off the gritty
side of his bass, sliding up the
neck, utilizing the “boooooiiing”

sound of the instrument.
Usually the fretless bass is
associated with smooth, sterile
recordings, but not here.
Harding stands out as the
strongest and most aggressive
soloist in the band, on alto as
well as bass.

The only weak line in the
album is the band's attempt at
“Day Tripper."‘While the three-
horn-and-drums arrangement
has potential, they attack -it like
part of a New Orleans march-
ing band that got juiced and
turned left on Basin Street
when the-rest of the parade
turned right. Funny, but only
once.

But overall, Residential Suite
shows that Hotel X is a power-
ful outfit, giving a nod to their
roots, borrowing elements from

 
  
   

 -3-..-: "

.» .-:-:». -.>.-:-*. _

Shyheim, BoogieMonsters,
Method Man, The Beatnuts,
Organized Konfusion and
GraveDiggaz.

The Super-duper-extra-

crazylistic phat single of the
year is ....... ..
Craig Mack’s “Flava In Ya
Ear,” the original and the
remix. This song sewed things
up from April until (it's still pop-
pin’ right now).

The sleeper album of 1994 is
Kurious’ “A Constipated
Monkey.” Even though this

i album was dated before it was

released due to holdups at Def
Jam, thenhis release and
signing to Hoppoh, Jorge’s
album was probably about
three years old. It was still
dope, and his style was slept
seriously. He has an uncanny
knack for freestylin’ at the drop
of a dime on things directly in
front of you. Kurious is the defi-
nition of a true emcee; lyrics on
spot, can rhyme to anything.

That’s a wrap on the year of
1994 in review for hip hop.
Have a safe X—mas break, and
keep it real for 1995. One love
for the year  -

1&2s whose scratches are just
as dope as the rest of the
track. People like Premire, D.J.
Scratch, Pete Rock and people
like that.

Blakk Steel: Basically, all the
peps that represent without
gimmicks and still use D.J.s in
their live shows. Those who
don’t; talking about killin’ and
don’t even own a gun; bottom
line those who stay true to
themselves.

So, check it, I'm up out. But
before I sprint, I want you to
just go to the next party and
think. Think about what moves
you and the way it makes you
feel, and I know damn well it

s a es exercise In
gore culcha has a formidable
appeal delivered with kinetic
camera work.

Filmmakers at the Fulton,
downtown Sixth Street, has
Bhaji on the Beach until the
16th. Gurinder Chadha, the
first Asian director of a British
feature, has created an enter-
taining comedy (albeit highly
reminiscent of a daytime soap)
that explores the lives of three
young women dealing with a
staunchly traditional older gen-
eration, pregnancy and
spousal abuse. The three
young women go on a retreat
with other women to the beach
to deal with their personal
crises and have a bit of fun.

After a one week holiday
break, Filmmakers reopens
with an under-the-ocean opus
from international filmmaker
extraordinaire Luc Besson.
Primarily known for the melan-
cholic La» Femme Nikita, a
fierce Pygmalianesque film
about a professional assassin,
and the recently released The
Professional, Besson has
turned his attention to Jacques
Cousteau’s territory and filmed
fierce Australian sharks, flip-
flopping Artic Seals, elegent
manta rays and gentle mana-
tees from the coast of Florida.
Besson spent three years on
Atlantis to shoot the hypnotic
and lyrical film which excels in
underwater camera work.

This weekend at the
Carnegie Museum of Art: Jim
Jarmusch’s Night on Earth
runs Friday night and Peter
Greenaway’s The
Draughtsman’s Contract will
be screened Saturday night.
Night on Earth is a collection of
five stories, each about a taxi
driver and his fare, each set at
exactly the same time but in a
different city (Los Angeles,
Paris, Rome, and Helsinki).
Starring Winona Ryder and
Gena Rowlands, Jarmusch’s
motley characters provide
much entertainment. The
Draughtsman’s Contract has
an aspiring architect design a
country house for a 17th-cen-
tury landowner. The architect
signs a contract which includes
an unusual clause with the
landowner’s wife: 12 drawings
for 12 sexual favors. Both
shows run 8 p.m.

Orgone Cinema: Boston
filmmaker and leftist radical
Sa-ul Levine will appear
Saturday, Dec. 17, at 9 p.m. to

discuss the radical democrati- H

zation of film language.

Levine rejected traditional
drama as too manipulative,
fascist and dogmatic and
replaced establishment form
by turning to jazz, blues and
De Kooning to develop a
kinetic style that disorients
viewers.

Films include: The Big Stick,
Chicago Reds and Blues;

ave
you
ever

» tried to
. play bas-
ketball on

the Pitt
campus?
Well I
have, and I
must say,
it’s a diffi-
cult task to say the least.
Let’s examine the hoops
facilities at our great cam-
pus.

Last Saturday afternoon,
I managed to drag five
friends off their respective
couches to play a little
three on three. I even man-
aged to get an unnamed
football player away from
his Sega long enough to
trek from Shadyside to join
us.

The first stop on our mis-
sion was the Field House,
which has four courts. We
were turned away within
seconds, because the varsi-
ty team was using the
courts.

The second stop was
Trees Hall, where I was
interrogated by a public
safety officer who asked
for ID, where I was going
and how long I’d be there.

I went up to the gym, L
and players were literally
hanging from the rafters to
get on the court. I knew we
would have to wait at least
20 minutes to get into the
big game on the center
court. So we left.

The next stop was
Bellefield. Besides the fact
that the gym is pathetic ——
one rim is too high and the
other is too low — it is
often empty. The drawback
is that it is usually filled
with high school kids. On
this day, it was just plain
full. I
We contemplated driving
to Squirrel Hill or Mellon
Park to play, but since it
was getting dark, we decid-
ed to go to CMU.

The gym there is pretty
nice. You also get a good .7
mix of players. As we
entered the gym, we imme-
diately got into the game
on the big court against a
fraternity.

No.5 UMass destroys Pitt within minutes  

Panthers
turn ball
over 27

times, /ose

85-57

By Sam Gresock
Staff Writer

No. 5 UMass exploited Pitt’s
27 turnovers and lack of depth
in rolling past the Panthers last
night, 85-57, despite a 20-
point, 12-rebound effort by Pitt
forward Chad Varga.

The Minutemen (2-1)
pumped in 39 points off Pitt
turnovers, grabbed 27 offen-
sive rebounds and shot 58.3
percent from three-point range
in a game in which UMass
took a lead six minutes into the
first half and never looked
back.

“With a team this physical 
you’re going to wear down,

and I think that’s what hap-_

pened to us,” Pitt coach'Ralph
Willard said in a post-game
radio interview. “They

[UMass] are just better in
every aspect of the game.”

Though the Panthers (1-3)
outshot UMass from the field
(43.6 percent to 43.1 percent)
and blocked nine shots, Pitt’s
turnovers smoothly paved the
road to victory for the
Minutemen, who had 11 points
off turnovers in the game’s first
13 minutes alone.

UMass also outrebounded
Pitt, 51-28, and pulled down 27
offensive rebounds. Entering
the game, the Minutemen were
averaging 18.5 offensive
boards per game.

“When you turn the ball
over, you’re not going to have
the opportunity to stay in the
game very long,’’ Willard said.
“If we don’t turn the ball over,
our man—to-man defense is
doing a good job.”

The Panthers were able to
use a tight man—to-man defense
to hold UMass forward Lou
Roe to 13 points. Entering the
game, Roe had been averaging
33.5 points per game.

“We were able to take Roe
out of the game,” Willard said.
‘‘If you could’ve told me prior
to he game that we would have
held Roe to 13 points, I
would’ve thought we’d proba-
bly have a decent chance to be

Ex-Pitt center Ieorns with {Bucks

By Brett Fondrk
Staff Writer

The ball bounces lazily off the
back of the iron. As the ball
rebounds towards the opponent,
an ominous force streaks
through the lane and slams the
ball through the hoop amidst the
roar of the Field House faithful.

Eric Mobley has just dunked.

Unfortunately for Pitt basket-
ball fans, Mobley, with his
intimidating presence in the
paint, is gone.

He has taken his rim—rocking
game to the NBA as the 18th
overall pick by the Milwaukee
Bucks.

He is currently in the rough
transition period between col-
lege and pro ball.

“Right now, I’m just going
through the process of making
sure that I know everything,” he
said. “I’m a rookie, a baby of
the game. I’m working on my
offense and defense because
everything is so much different.

“There’s a lot more plays.

You can have one play, and off
that one play, you can have five
or six different sets.”
‘ But he said that he has had
very little problem picking up
the plays because he has an
excellent teacher in head coach
Mike Dunleavy. He feels that
Dunleavy’s career as a player
makes him a better coach.

“He understands if we’re
going through something that
we don’t understand because
he’s been there before,” he said.

“He knows what the players are
going through.

Stottlemyer.

“We did a lot of
good things, but we did
a lot of bad things,
too,” Stottlemyer said.
“It’s a tough time right
now, with a lot of guys
taking their finals, but
a lot of guys did nice
jobs. You know, its
nice to get a win, but
we certainly could have
done things better.”

One guy who did a
“nice job,” once again,

Behind freshman Latia
Howard's 16 points and 13
rebounds, the Lady Panthers
shot their way past host
Syracuse, 75-63, in Pitt's Big
East opener.

Down by one point at half-
time, the Lady Panthers took
the lead in the second half by
shooting an astounding .536
from the field, opposed to the
Orangewomen's paltry .222.

Senior captain Jenine Joyce
connected for four three-
pointers en route to her
game-high 20-point perfor-
mance.

Guard Stephanie Petho fin-
ished with 17 points and
seven rebounds.

Point guard Carol Morton
dished out 11 assists, but also
had 11 turnovers.

Pitt upped its record to 3-2,
while 'Cuse fell to 2-4.

J.J. Fasnacht, now 11-2. He
went out and literally toyed
with his opponent,
Bloomsburg’s Don Rosas,
taking him down and then
letting him up again, en
route to a 17-5 win. The
major decision win was key,
giving the Panthers a 7-6
lead in the team score which
they would never relinquish.

“J.J. just went out and did
what he had to do for the
team,” coach Stottlemyer
said of the win.

Other vital wins included
Panther Larry Sprecher’s 6-2
win over Mark Getz in the

Wiltanger hit a two-point
escape as the third started to
seal his win.

At the other end of the
spectrum, sophomore 118-
pounder Chris Stevens got a
critical takedown with time
running out in the third peri-
od to snatch a 5-4 win over
Bloomsburg’s Mark Hall.

Stottlemyer gave credit to
tough freshmen Chad Jesko
and Chris Cox in losing
efforts.

“Chris Cox, even though
he lost, did a great job. He
wrestled an All-American
[unbeaten Senior Brad
Rozanski], and also at 126,
he was an All-American
[Bloomsburg senior Pete
Rinella] and Jesko hung in
there with him.”

Rinella decisioned Chad
Jesko in an exciting, close
matchup, 5-3. Cox was deci-
sioned by Rinella by a score
of 3-1 in a match that easily
could have gone either way.

Bloomsburg picked up its
other seven points in wins
over Panther senior Derek
Burgert and redshirt fresh-
man Mark Bodo.

“There were some good

things, but we looked kind of
tired,” Stottlemyer said. “I
don’t like that. I want us to
have a big gas tank going
into that third period, so we
can really go. I’m glad we
won, but we certainly have a
lot of improving to do.”

Mobley

°From page 9

raise his voice, but overall he’s a
nice guy. But you’ve got to
remember that you can’t be hol-
lering at these guys for no. rea-
son, because some of them will
try and take your head off.
They’re getting paid, and as
long as they’re producing, they
don’t give a damn.”

Producing on a regular basis
is definitely something that
Mobley longs for. He has been
getting limited minutes in the
Bucks’ rotation.

“Basically, I knew that I
wasn’t going to play a lot,” he
said. “It’s hard for people to
understand ‘because they say,
‘Why did he [Dunleavy] take
you 18th if he’s not going to
play you?’ But he’s done that
with their lottery picks, so it’s
really not bothering me that
much.

“I know as -‘we get into the
year, I should get some more
time.”

So Mobley has gone from
being the man at Pitt, to “roo ,”

Hoops

J in this basketball game.”
After a Varga layup tied the 9

game at 9-9 nearly six minutes
into the contest, Pitt saw
UMass explode with a 19-4

»-run during the middle of the

first half en route to a 42-17
halftime lead.

- .- UMass went on a~13-4 run at

the beginning of the second

1 half. The Minutemen’s biggest

lead of the game came four
minutes into the second half
when center Marcus Camby
hit a free throw to give UMass
a 55-21 lead.

“We’re so limited in terms of
what we can do and in terms of
making any kind of adjust-
ments,” Willard said. “They’re
taking away ball reversal and
they’re pressuring our guards,
and right now we’re not good
enough to combat that.”

Varga hit a layup at the 12-
minute mark to cut Pitt’s
deficit to 61-36, but Donta
Bright and Roe hit six straight
free throws to extend the
Minutemen’s lead to 31. Pitt
guard Jason Maile followed by
hitting his first of ﬁve second-
half three-pointers with little
over eight minutes left.

“I can’t get frustrated with
the kids, because none of these
kids have been in this situation
right now [where they had] to
play 30 minutes a game
against teams of this caliber,”
Willard said. “We’ve just got
to get some experience.”

Varga led all scorers with 20
points, including 12 in the sec-
ond half. Maile had 17 points,
including his five three-point-
ers late in the game. Orlando
Antigua, who fouled out with
7:52 left in the game, had
seven points.

Mike‘Williams and Roe each
had 13 points to lead UMass.
Bright added 12 points for the
Minutemen, who are now 20-0
in home games at the Mullins
Center.

 

a term that is given to all fnst—
year players, including the
Bucks’ biggest investment,
Glenn Robinson.

But nicknames aside, Mobley
says that the chemistry on the
team is excellent. There is no
animosity in the locker room,
which is surprising because of
Robinson’s well-publicized con-
tract problems.

“Glenn is really down to
earth,” Mobley said. “You’d
think that since he was the No. 1
pick that he’d be like, ‘I’m the
man,’ but he hit it off with
everybody. Everyone gets along
real well on the team.”

But despite the busy life that
he leads in Milwaukee, he still
finds time to keep in touch with
current Pitt players Jerry
McCullough and Orlando
Antigua.

He feels that the only. place
the Pitt program can go with
new coach Ralph Willard is up.

“I’ve heard that he has done a
really good job recruiting,” he
said. “They’re gonna have a hel-

luva team next year, but he’s
gonna take his lumps this sea-
son.”

And unfortunately for
Mobley, the Panthers frequently
took their lumps during his
career under coach Paul Evans.
The team couldn’t even manage
a winning record during

Mobley’s monster senior sea-
son, during which he averaged
13 points and eight rebounds a
game, as he shot 56 percent
from the field...

“I miss Pitt,” he said “I wish
we could have won more. The
only thing that I reallyvregret is
that I wish I could have learned
a lot more, because since I’ve

  

come here to Milwaukee, I’ve
learned so much.

“I have Mike Dunleavy say-
ing, ‘Damn Eric, I can imagine
how good you could have been
if somebody would have just
taught you this earlier in your
career.’ I hear it so often."

Many would say that “some-
body” would refer to Evans,
whose contract was not renewed
after last season. But Mobley
doesn’t blame him for his lack
of tutelage in the post. He
blames himself.

“If I would have had a better
head on my shoulders,” he said,
“I would have been better
off.”

So Mobley is learning, and at
the same time seems to be
enjoying just simply being a
Buck. He has been dubbed by
some as Mi1waukee’s center of
the future.

“I’m definitely in their future
plans,” he said. “Hopefully, I
can be in Milwaukee for my
whole career; It’s a good feeling
knowing that they know that the

11

job can be mine one day, and all
mine.”

And just like the situation at
Pitt, many feel that the Bucks
are just a few years away from
being a solid team. In fact, they
are already turning some heads
around the league this year.

“The attitude is good here
because we’ve got a lot of
young players, nobody has
injuries and everybody is
happy,” he said. “We don’t real-
ly have one superstar, so every-
one has to work together night

in and night out to be success-

ful.”

For Mobley to be successful
and reach his goal for the year,
he must get more playing time.

He is shooting for the armual
rookie game during All-Star
weekend. It is a lofty goal, but
he feels that itis not out of
reach. I

“It’ gonna be hard right now
because I'm not playing that
much,” he said. “But if my min-
utes pick up, I might be able to
sneak in there.”

minutes after looking for
45 minutes. It doesn’t add
up. Let’s look at why.

The Field House is usual-
ly available at night.

However, I have gone
there and been told that the
main court is closed
despite the fact that a
group of players, obviously
basketball gods, or NBA
players, were using the
main court. I was shuttled
to the horrid upper‘ courts,
while these players, many
of whom were clearly not
students, had the run of the
place.

Trees is just horrid.
Besides the numerous dead
spots on the floor, the gym
is always full. I’d estimate
that probably 60 percent of
the players there don’t go
to Pitt. How they get ’
in with no ID is beyond
me.

I have been told by some
that the guards get to know
the local people who come
in. It’s hard to believe that
they knew the player who,
two weeks ago, was caught
playing ball while a MAC-
10 machine gun was nes-
tled in his jacket.

I shudder to think what
would have happened ifI
had argued a call with him.

Another problem is that
the small gym is always
rented out for badminton.
That leaves three courts for
25,000 students. You can
see how problems arise.

Bellefield is usually
either rented out or overrun
by high school students.
The high school kids are
why every rim in the gym

is mangled. They climb up
the wall and swing from
the rims like monkeys.

If someone would occa-
sionally come around to
check an ID or two, maybe
this wouldn’t happen.
Once, I got so angry that I
called the campus police
to complain. I was told
that these kids have
after-school activities in
the gym. That doesn’t
explain why they are
destroying the place on
Saturday.

I have been told by a
number of people that
other large schools don’t
have this problem. Our
mid—state rival, PSU, is
said to be a players dream.
They unofficially have
over 20 courts, indoor and
out. You can apparently
always find a place to play.
Why can’t we have the
same?

Now I know that there
will be people crying
because we have no
space. I don’t want to hear
it.

There is no reason why
one should have to drive to
another school to play a
game of three on three.
Find some space, do some-
thing, let people play bad-
minton at the Cost Center
and for god’s sake, check
some IDs and keep us from
getting shot.

Without our tuition
money, none of these facil-
ities would even exist, and
the people not checking
the IDs would be out a
job.

United -States
Presidential Curse
in the 20th Century

The German Jewish Holgcaust brings constant publicity while the presiden-
tial curse on innocent Americans is constantly covered up in all our media.
Since Rudolph Hertz in 1895 accidentally invented the subliminal mind con-
trol microphone and speaker. our presidents have yearly issued secret exec-
utive orders io satisfy all leaders in a dozen areas of concern of subliminal
mind control. Many of us worry that these secret executive orders will lead to
a permanent dictator «as president. In 1942, mail censorship was added by
Franklin Roosevelt. Military leaders made it a deserved national security
issue. Men of God demanded and got a modern ugly religious inquisition.
which is far worse than in previous history for this harms vast numbers of
innocents. This is now a pork barrel bureaucratic nightmare which wastes bil-
lions of tax dollars. Since business states this will be the advertising, market-
ing and sales of the future. almost all have experimental subliminal radios on
their properties. You have heard of subliminal radio tapes telling customers
not to steal which are quite successful. Increased sales are a bonus of these
subliminals. Personnel departments are experimenters in training, in opera-
tion and eliminating employees. in every war. militaries have used subliminals
on their troops. Since lawyers and judges are forbidden to test subliminal
mind control criminal cases in court. unnecessary crimes are increasing.
Many victims are in mental hospitals. prisons, and cemeteries. Our govern-
ment has caused murder. death, divorce, drugs,'destruction. poverty, perse-
cution. discrimination, suicide. rape, slavery, homosexuality, family separa-
tion. and stunted blighted lives. This “anything goes‘ attitude. when a mind
control victim commits a subliminal mind control crime, is over loading our
courts, increases subliminal crime and harms all of us. This is one of the rea-

,, sons our justice system fails. Our federal judges refuse to allow a court win

against our postal service of mail censorship. Mail censorship grows yearly as
victims must be denied warnings, information as this flyer. or financial help in

’ fighting against this inquisition. All media must ignore this ugliness for citizens

would scream to stop it. This is a perfect example of our failure in education
and media to teach, to inform, to warn and expose. Subliminal radios transmit
a lower radio wave (infrasonic) or a higher wave (ultrasonic) than normal
sound. Every vibration, pitch, intensity, variation of the wave word bit in fre-
quency strike ones ears which are fooled since no sound is heard. Your ears
sends these subliminal word bit waves to your brain which thinks it is thinking
a thought since there is no noise sound. As this radio invention advances,
mind controllers can speak out of a persons mouth. You can't trust your own
mouth as the words might be someone elses. It is hard to believe how much
terrible grief can be caused by someone else speaking out of innocents
mouths. For the innocent victims, who are called paranoid schizophrenics. all
government becomes an enemy. These innocent victims become scape goat

- comics to be laughed and tricked by all in justice. media, business and all gov-

ernment departments. To add to our grief, we are being used as medical
guinea pigs without our consent, knowledge or payment. You must complain
to your man or woman of God and religion to stop this modern inquisition.
America is being turned into a shame and disgrace by our leaders. Our gen- ‘
eral decline in morality, honesty and decency can be blamed on this stupid
mess. Why is it that i only complain and protest this total loss of our human,
rights? Please write me your thoughts of this presidential curse and send a
copy to the White House. For your safety, please do not sign your name for
you can trust no one but your wallet, i.e., until they empty it. The road to hell
is paved with good intentions but sadly it always ends with evil sins hurting the .
innocent while greedy pockets fortunes. As usual, the lesson learned is that
money is the only thing that counts. Think - for you might be the next victim!
