Pitt Admission Sought

By Suspended Cadets

BY PETE BUTCH

At least three West Point cadets
who were dismissed for one year
for violations of the military
academy’s honor code have ap-
proached Pitt for permission to
attend classes this fall.

Pitt Dean of Admissions Ken-
neth Wenger said that two ex-ca-
dets have contacted the School of
Engineering concerning temporary
admission while another has been
interviewed at Pitt’s Bradford
campus.

Wenger explained students dis-
missed from other schools for
disciplinary reasons cannot be
admitted to the School of Engineer-
ing. But, according to Wenger, it
has not been decided whether
suspension constitutes a _severe
disciplinary action like expulsion.

“If they meet admission criteria,
I see no reason why they should not
be admitted,” Wenger said. He
said he doubted that enough red
tape would be cleared for them to
attend day school this fall.

The third student has been

interviewed twice at the Bradford
Campus, according to Mike Muldi-
hill of Bradford admissions office.
That student is currently being
interviewed at the Oakland cam-
pus, also. According to Muldihill,
the student would prefer to apply to
the Oakland campus, but if denied
that, he would apply to Pitt
Bradford. He also is considering
other scools, Muldihill said.

School of Engineering Recruiter
Charles Aveni, also agreed that
dismissed students could not be
admitted to the School of Engineer-
ing. But he maintained that these
ex—West Point cadets were not
expelled. He also said they were-
good students.

Associate Dean of Engineering
Walter Turkes sought advice in the
form of a memorandum from
Provost Rhoten Smith’s office,
according to an official in the
Engineering School. Neither Tur-
kes nor Smith could be reached
yesterday. Chancellor Wesley Pos-
var was also unavailable, but

 Commuters Without Representation

if

"w-....«‘



The Commuter Association hit a
dead end this summer‘ when it
“voluntarily dissolved” in the face
of alleged violations of the
Committee on Student Organiza-
tions bylaws, leaving Pitt commu-
ters without official representation.

On May 11, after an Allocations
Committee request that the Stu-
dent Organizations committee re-
view the status of the Commuter
Association, a hearing on the
alleged violations was held. Any
Allocation Committee budget re-

_ commendations for the commuter

group was pending on the Student
Organizations committee findings.

In addition, the Allocations
Committee claimed the Commuter
Association did not hold an election
of officers and failed to abide by its
constitution. —

Under its guidelines, the Com-
mittee on Student Organizations
may revoke the recognition or
privileges of a group that does not
have 25 active members.

In answer to Committee on
Student Organizations charges,
commuter representative Larry
Chaban said the Commuter Assoc-
iation includes every commuter on
campus. He added, “There are
about 10 to 15 people who attend
meetings, although seven people
coordinate the programming.”

After a Committee on Student
Organizations executive session,

the Commuter Association was
delivered an ultimatum to either
hold an election of officers with at
least 25 members present or forfeit
their status as a student organiza-
tion.

The group readily complied.

“Ifthat’s the way to get out
money from the Allocations Com-

_ mittee, we’ll do it,” said Commu-

ter steering committee member
Tom Pochapsky.

Committee on Student Organiza-
tion Chairman Hank Kearney

Sociological Society Defends Nyden

BY BILL MOORE

A resolution sharply criticizing
the university's handling of the
Paul Nyden case passed the
American Sociological Associa-
tion’s (ASA) annual meeting by a
narrow margin last week, although
ASA officials have stressed that the
vote was not official.

Dr. Nyden, an assistant profes-
sor of Sociology who is fighting for
tenure, stresses Marxism in his
courses and has said his political
leanings have affected his tenure.

Nyden was the center of intense
controversy last spring, including
numerous student demonstrations.

The ASA voted 119 to 111 to
submit a resolution to the ASA’s
Committee on Freedom of Re-
search and Teaching. The
resolution accuses the university of
dismissing Nyden because of his

admitted there are no provisions in
his group's bylaws to take action
against a student organization for
not adhering to its own constitu-
tion, but “precedents permit us to
advise that they hold an election."

The Commuter Association held
its election of officers on June 9 and
10. But election procedures were
soon challenged with alleged
improprieties. Charges that voters
in the election were not required to
produce identiﬁcation, the ballot
was not _ a» secret one, election

political views and activities, and
demands his reinstatement.

A separate resolution calls on the
University to release all documents
related to the case. p

The University, in turn, has
charged Nyden with conducting an
“intensive propaganda campaign
against the University. ’ ’

The University, in an onfficial
statement, reiterated the stand that
Nyden should use the established
system of appeals and review,
rather than using a publicity
campaign.

Nyden has called the vote by 300
of the ASA’s 3,800 members a
substantial victory for his cause.

Dr. William D’Antonio, Chair-
man of the ASA Committee on
Freedom, said yesterday, however.
that the vote by 119 of the members
present at the New York caucus
was far from an official endorse-
ment of Nyden.

workers were guilty of improper
“recruiting” and at least one voter
used an assumed name when
voting, were delivered by the
Committee on Student Organiza-
tions. _
Kearney said, “I was walking
down the hall (and the election
worker)...asked me to vote, saying

he needed only one more vote for ‘

25. He became very embarrassed
when I told him who I was,”

Kearney said.
(Continued on Page 2)

D’Antonio, a University of
Connecticut professor, said the

vote constituted only a proposal. ‘

He said his committee would be
sfudying that proposal, and has not
yet made any decision.

Alfred McLung Lee, a past
President of the ASA, said last
week that Pitt had not cooperated
with the ASA and had withheld
documents."

Lee said Pitt’s Sociology depart-

mom has a reputation of being ?,;=:,.
intolerant to leftist political views. ‘

“Their department has a reputa-
tion of senior faculty members

doing research for special interest 9
groups—big industry, the Army, V

the Navy.”
D’Antonio said yesterday, how V
ever, that Lee’s charge of?

uncooperativeness by the Univer-
sity was false.

D’Antonio also countered a

statement attributed to Lee which '

Football Fans
  Brave Long
 Ticket Lines .

BY CRIS HALL

’ More than 4,000 Pitt students
have purchased $3 strips of tickets
to all home football games.
Although the lines at the Cathedral
basement ticket counters will
remain long until the tickets are all
picked up, students can still apply
for guaranteed seats. A

This year, for the first time, Pitt
students are being given the option

of purchasing a ticket for each. of

the Panther games at Pitt Stadium.

The program started before the end
of winter term when the athletic
department began accepting appli-
cations and checks.

Only recently were students able
to pick up their tickets. But,
according to Assistant Ticket
Manager John
they’re making up for lost time.

“They came in droves today,”
Leiendecker said last night. “We
picked up a couple of hundred new
applications, and almost half the

4,000 previously sold have been i

picked up.”

When the Cathedral ticket
booths opened yesterday’ morning,
one person was working there.
Leiendecker said four persons will
greet students picking up tickets
today. > -

Students who have already
applied and paid for their tickets
need only their validation cards and
identification. .

Those who have not yet applied

should bring with them a check I

made out to the University of
Pttsburgh for $3. The tentative
deadline for applications is Friday,
Sept. 23.

Though the program is new,
Leiendecker said it seems to have
been accepted.

“It seems to have gone all right L

up to now,” he said. “Nobody’is'

complaining.”

CA Dissolves
After CSO

Allegations

(Continued from Page I)

Once again confronted with
alleged improprieties of the bylaws
the Association still faced expul-
sion as a student organization.

Kearney delivered a second
ultimatum, giving the Commuter
Association the option of holding
another election by July 1 or
relinquishing their organizational
status.

. Another election never was held.

During the week of July 11, The
Pitt News received a letter
announcing theaorganizations’ dis-
bandment.

In the letter, Diane Giebler, who
was elected Commuter Association
president in the controversial June
election spoke on behalf of the
group.

“l’ve discussed this with the
other ofﬁcers and we could see no
reason to continue. We feel a bit
persecuted.” she said. “They
wouldn’t release our budget and
said we didn’t have enough
members.”

Giebler’s letter also reflected an
“immense lack of interest by
commuters as a whole. They just
don’t seem to care,” the letter
stated. “I can only hope that
Student Government will now rise
to meet commuters’ needs and to
serve their interests.”

_After the CA “voluntarily
d1SS0lVed." SG President Barry
Weisband said commuter interest
would have to increase before a
SGB committee on commuters
would be formed.

Floor parties in the residence
halls may be a thing of the past if
the Resident Assistants (RA’s)
follow new enforcement guidelines
regarding underage drinking.

“The new guidelines are not part
of a new policy on drugs and
alcohol," Office of Residence Life
Director Fred Fonseca said. “The
policy has always been to prohibit
drug use and underage drinking in
the halls. We have given the RAs
new guidelines for dealing with the
enforcement of the policies.”

JoAnn Woodson Gibbs, assistant
to the residence life director,
explained that the new emphasis
on enforcement of alcohol guide-
lines is part of a move to create a
more consistent policy of enforce-
ment. A

“Last year, there may have been

some discrepancy between the way ..

some RAs handled underage
drinking cases and some drug
incidents,” Gibbs said. “Alcohol

isjust as dangerous a drug, and we
should discourage its use as much
as we discourage drug use.”

According to Gibbs, if the RA is
aware of underage drinking at a
party, he or she must ask the host
to break up the party. If the host
does not, the RA will contact the
area coordinator.

“This serves as the first
warning," Gibbs said. “Following
a ﬁrst warning, depending on the
situation, the RA will be required
to ﬁle an incident report."

Gibbs said repeated offenses
could result in a judicial board
hearing. -

“We can see we will have
problems, but that doesn’t mean
we shouldn’t be dealing with
underage drinking,” she said.

  Dorm Parties-In the Post?

“We won’t be checking bags at the
door, but the enforcement pro-
cedure will eliminate big public
beer blasts on the ﬂoors."

Gibbs also announced a new
educational program to make
residents aware of security risks.

“The highest rate of theft on
campus occurs in the residence
halls, and we are encouraging
students to lock their doors and to
be responsible for their ‘own
security,” Gibbs said.

The symbol of the new security
plan is a “turkey,” Gibbs said.
The turkey symbol will be used
largely because of its wide
recognition factor for students.

The 24 hour escort system will
remain a principal part of the

security system this year, she said. /r/y-./y~./.~/.x/./.-r.4~/./y~.r/A//.7-./yx/~.c//yx/ ./yy:/~

"70 Year: of collggigu Journalism at the University of Pittsburgh"

  During the Summer. . .

The Pitt campus in the summer had a kind of dream land quality to
it. It was a place where empty parking spaces abounded and where

long lines were seldom seen.

But underneath it all lurked the twilight zone of an urban
community. Crime continued to plague its streets and one Oakland
resident complained in a letter to a local newspaper that Oakland at

- night is like Dodge City where brawls break out every night.

Chancellor Posvar’s wife was robbed out in front of the Cathedral.
In the face of a high crime rate, the Campus Police are charged with
racism and some members of the Pitt administration wish to reduce its

power

During the summer, a few more of Oakland’s apartment buildings

deteriorated further, making worse an already critical housing

shortage.

During the summer, there continued to be squabbling among
student groups and the University Senate approved the formation of
the Faculty Assembly over the objections of both the administration
and the Student Government Board. «

During the summer, the University fought lawsuits and withstood
criticism for denying certain University professors tenure.

And during the summer there was a tuition hike (but you probably
know that) and already there is talk about next year’s tuition hike.

To sum up, there were ﬁghts, brawls, muggings, rape; bureaucratic
squabbling, student inﬁghting, tenure battles, a tuition increase and a
housing shortage. In short, Pitt was pretty much the same as it always
is and, starting today, with the return of the trafﬁc and long lines,

things will return to nomial.

So welcome back and, considering what’s normal around here, good
luck. Unfortunately, you’ll probably need it.

Here We Go Again  

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

The crisp bite of fall on the wind
brings us back to the good old
University of Pittsburgh, minus
those, of course, who didn't make
that last tuition hike.

One of the most moving vistas in
the Great Return to our Alma
Mater is the beginning of a fresh
cycle of events, that over the untold
years between freshman and senior
year become well-grooved into the
population here.

It seems that we are all destined
to re-enact the same defeats and
victories year after year in a great

‘repetition that changes the num-
bers and names, leaving the
essentials the same.

So predictable has the routine of
emergencies, meetings and “is-
sues” ‘become that this fall a list of

SSN and Freedom  “P;:'::“:.:V:“*:..“:*‘:.::.:'::“:::,;

Dear Chancellor Posvar:

The American Civil Liberties
Union has received a number of
complaints concerning the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh’s continued use
of Social Security numbers for
university students. Some time
ago, we wrote to the registrat,
Frank Reed, concerning this policy
and received no reply.

As you may know, the Privacy
Act forbids federal, state and local
government agencies from requir-
ing disclosure of Social Security
numbers unless the disclosure is
required by federal law or by a
state law adopted before January
1975. The Privacy Act reﬂects
Congressional disapproval of the
growing use of Social Security
numbers as universal identiﬁers.

_ There are many dangers assoc-
iated with a Standard Universal
Identiﬁer (SUI). An SUI creates a
national population register which
in turn could become part of a
national dossier number. Already,
a person's Social Security number
can be used to retrieve ﬁles from
such a diverse set of data banks as
those maintained by insurance
companies, hospitals, the FBI, the
IRS, private corporations and your
university. In Project SEARCH, a
cooperative venture of ten states, it
was found that an individual’s
entire criminal history could be
retrieved within a matter of
minutes using only two queries and
an identiﬁcation number. With the
growing interconnection between
computers, an individual’s entire
personal life history may be
available at the push of a button.

An established SUI allows tremen-
dous opportunity for abuse, either
by government agencies who have

' computer and data bank link-ups or

by anyone else with knowledge of
and access to computers.

Reed’s lack of response to our
complaint disturbs us greatly. We
feel that the increasing use of
Social Security numbers, which
Congress recognizes as a clear
invasion of privacy, merits a
response other than reticence. It
seems that the University, or at
least Frank Reed, has no concern
for the privacy of students’ school
records. We remind you that the
University did not in the ' past
require Social Security numbers
and was able to function perfectly
well.

Under protest from the Wiscon-
sin CLU, the University of
Wisconsin agreed to discontinue
the use of Social Security numbers

a for students applying for admission

or financial aid.

We have written to Camegie-
Mellon University protesting its
use of Social Security numbers as
student identiﬁcation numbers and
are waiting to hear a response.

We would greatly appreciate
your reconsidering your policy of
using federal Social ‘Security
numbers as the student identiﬁca-
tion numbers at the University of
Pittsburgh. If you have any
questions or would like to speak
with us, we would welcome an
opportunity to discuss your policy,
with you.

Thank you in advance for your
anticipated cooperation.

Very truly yours,

Ellen M. Doyle

Executive Director

American Civil Liberties Union
Greater Pittsburgh Chapter

forward to, as Pitt people have
term after term, ever since Henry
Hugh Brackenridge started it all as
a practical joke on Harvard about
100 years ago....

THE UPRISING: Not long after the
fall term begins, the University
administration using all the guile of
George Patton inevitably comes up

with some idea machine-tooled to
get a rise out ‘of student
government.

Student leaders spring with a
howl to the conflict trading
barrages of political science rhetor-
ic with the boys and girls in the
Cathedral of Learning.

Invariably they settle down and
compromise on something or other,
and student leaders look up just in
time to be crushed by speeding
mid-term examinations.

THE TENURE CON: Like the great
procession of seasons, each year
some poor sucker is denied tenure
for reasons he or she can never
comprehend. This usually is the
culmination of six years of
enthusiastic encouragement by
fellow scholars or benign neglect
from those ranking above and
beyond his or her department.
Student admirers of the victim
rally around, while the person at

the end of the knife, ﬁnding every
door closed, becomes disheveled,
desperate and a danger to the
profession.

Ultimately the entire matter is
engulfed by some committee or
other to await the next ice age or
the Second Coming of Christ.

‘CENTRALIZATION: Each year
something or other is centralized in
the University. The result is shreiks
of pain and anguish throughout the
various duchies, ﬁefdoms and
plantations that make up the
institution. _A great deal of money
is saved, wrung drop by drop from
the ranks of those who once found
comfort in their very own whatever-
it-is that is being centralized.

After a period, the new
centralized ofﬁce for whatever
becomes so bogged down that one
by one the ruling elements of the
University sneak off to get a
free-lancer.

THE PILGRIMAGE: Once every
year the vanguard of the Univer-
sity, robes ﬂying, make a pilgrim-
age to Harrisburg to ask the
legislators whether or not tuition
will be raised. The answer is
always yes, which is followed by a
great hoopala about the miles of
unrepaired roads and starving
ward heelers.

PARKING: Like the coming of the
ﬁrst frost, each year someone with
enough clout to form a committee
gets a parking ticket. The parking
problem then is given all the
attention it deserves, a study or two
is completed and everyone goes
back to haggling for the free spaces
available.

EDUCATION: Student leaders
become concerned over the quality
of education received in class-
rooms. Faculty sqwauk at the
thought of unwashed undergrad-
uates evaluating their podium
presence.

Some one points out that giant
lecture rooms crammed with
sweating undergraduates support
the prestigious graduate programs
which couldn't turn a buck to save
their lives.

In rebuttal someone else points
out that without the graduate
programs providing the cheap
labor supply, it would be imposs-
ible to teach undergraduates.

Everyone gets confused and
walks away, and student leaders
look up just in time to be crushed
by on-rushing ﬁnals.

SOCIALISM: Each year a great
socialist cause makes itself mani-
fest on the green campus and a
bunch of people get worked up over
educating the masses to overthrow
the capitalist interests running the
University, never guessing that
most students aspire to just that:
one of those interested capitalists.
The administration sweats it out
through one or two media blitzes,
not without a few good laughs.
Ten years later everyone recog-
nizes what a shame it is that such
and such isn't doing so and so, and
anew federal bureaucracy is born.

THE SPEAKER: Each year some-
one is ﬂown in over the walls to
address individuals on campus
about the realities of the cruel
'world just outside. There is usually
a good reason for somebody getting
upset, somewhere.

LAWSUIT: Like clockwork, each
year brings a new lawsuit of
precedent-setting proportions
against the University. Lawyers in
battle dress are mobilized in a
matter of business days and
deployed at every legal weak spot.
In the meantime a lot of people get
to go to lunch Downtown in those
fancy restaurants to talk over the
aspects of the case.

MANDATES: Each term brings a
new mandate from the Chancellor
to somebody in the University to
act on a speciﬁc issue and form an
ad hoc committee, or a disappear-‘
ing task force if his or her Latin is
dusty. .

Now some might be disturbed,
perhaps even insulted, at the
suggestion that the events and
people of the University are wound
into a great institutional serpent
biting its own tail. These same
people might be highly troubled to
learn that this University boasts its
own Center for Cyclical Research.
Naturally no one likes to think of
themselves as just another ﬂeshy
link in a chain, and a circular one at
that.

But the University is a ponderous
creature with a mighty wake, and
most of us are sucked ‘I-n along
behind, immersed in some inﬁntes-
imal crisis of the day and the hour.

There's a beauty in the repeti-
tion, though, like an old peasant
myth slightly worn from the telling,

. but still, interesting. _ , M _ A , _ p M W V 4

STUDENT ACTIVITIES
PLANS FALL FAIR

Student Organizations have been
invited to participate in a student
activities fair slated for Sept. 15.

Although invitations for the fair
have been distributed to student
groups, the idea has yet to receive
ofﬁcial Student Government Board
approval.

Hank Kearney, chairman of the
Committee on Student Organiza-
tions, said the response from major
student groups has been almost
unanimously in favor of the event,
which is planned for 11 a.m. to 5
p.m. in the Student Union.

“We expect very good response
from the smaller groups but
haven’t heard from them since
many are just returning to
campus,” Kearney said. _

He said the committee felt
freshmen orientation had not
provided enough of an opportunity
for incoming freshmen to become
familiar with the various student
organizations.’ ‘

“It will also give other students a
chance to see where their student
activities fee goes,” Kearney said.

PSEA FOLDS TENT

For the ﬁrst time in nearly a year
and a half, the University is without
a pending union election with the
end of labor attempts to organize
non-teaching professionals here.

Student Meets Landlord: Facts to

The Legal Awareness Committee
will be writing a number of articles
on legal difficulties common to
students, and the advice their
committee offers. In this first
installment, committee member
Paul Matthews writes on the
problems that arise when student
meets landlord.

BY PAUL MATHEWS

vThe Legal--._ Awareness Com-
mittee handles hundreds of land-
lord-tenant complaints each year
from Pitt students living off
campus. Typically, most landlord-
tenant disputes arise from student
ignorance of tenant rights and
responsibilities.

The committee has handled a
number of landlord-tenant cases
where the source of the dispute has
arisen from either the landlord
or the tenant's intentional disre-
gard for acknowledged responsi-
bilities. S

Students should use some
descretion when choosing off-
campus housing; such as making
sure the landlord has a good
reputation, the unit is in good
repair and the terms of the lease
are reasonable.

Although the law provides
tenants with numerous rights

. protecting them from unscrupulous

landlords, the time, money and
inconvenience required to sue a
landlord usually is beyond the
typical student's resources.
Landlords will always use this to
their advantage. For the most part,
students are at the mercy of their
landlords, whether they like to
believe it or not, so choose them
wisgiy. ~ ‘

The best way to choose a
landlord is to start early and
conduct a simple investigation of
every potential landlord. Meet and
talk with them and try to gain an

impression of how each conducts A

The Pennsylvania "State Teachers
Association (PSEA), which has
been involved in two
campaigns at Pitt over the past
year withdrew from legal proceed-
ings which would have led to an
election in the near future.

There was no formal comment
from PSEA ofﬁcials, except to
conﬁrm that the campaign had
ended.

The PSEA withdrawal comes
after two defeats in union elections
on campus, the ﬁrst in the last
year's faculty union elections, and
more recently in a labor election for
support personnel.

’There were also unconfirmed
reports that the PSEA would close
its third-ﬂoor suite of ofﬁces in the
Webster Hall Hotel, moving
operations to the Union Bank
Building, Downtown.

According to PSEA officials, the
union spent nearly $100,000 on its

faculty union campaign alone. p

29 GROUPS SUSPENDED

Twenty nine student organiza-
tions have been suspended for
failure to meet a July deadline for
the return of a Committee on
Student Organizations application.

The organizations are no longer
permitted to reserve any univerity
rooms of facilities, or use any funds
previously allocated them by the
Student Government Board.

The organizations also may no
longer use the ofﬁces assigned

business. Have the landlord show
the unit personally and ask
questions about the condition and
repair of the unit and terms of the
lease.

Also, try to ﬁnd out where else
the landlord rents units and go talk
to the tenants. Be sure to "ask them
how receptive the landlord is to
maintenance requests.‘ If they’ve
had trouble, try another landlord-.
It is also wise to consult the Legal
Awareness Committee about the
landlord’s reputation. :*More often
than not, the committee will have
some background information.

If the prospective landlord
appears to be fair, the unit is in
good repair and the terms of the
lease are usually reasonable, then
chances are excellent the student
will not encounter problems.

If the unit is in poor repair but
the landlord promises to improve
its condition before the student
moves in, do not sign the lease
before the repairs are made. If the
landlord insists the student sign
the lease before the repair work is
begun, offer the landlord a holding
deposit instead. "

A holding deposit is a sum of
money usually applied against the

ﬁrst month’s rent that holds the
unit in the prospective tenant’s
name for a speciﬁed period of time
until the tenant is ready to sign the
lease. If the student should change
his mind during the holding and
elect not to rent the unit, the
landlord gets to keep the deposit.

If the landlord refuses to accept a
holding deposit and still insists the
student sign the lease before the
promised repair work is done, the
landlord's sincerity is suspect, and
the student should consider an-
other place to live. If this is not
possible, be sure to at least get the
promise in writing, preferably as
part of the lease.

The student also should show
some respect for the property he
rents. Most of the landlord-tenant

encountered in the past with
respect to student abuse of

This is especially true when-

dealing with security deposits.
Most students who lose all or part
of their security deposits discover

the reason for the penalty is the

on

unkeriﬁit condition of their rented
home.

'Once a student chooses his
off-campus home, he usually will
be required to sign a lease and pay
a security deposit. A lease is an
agreement between the landlord
and the tenant, either written or
oral, describing the responsibilities
of both the landlord and the tenant.
The conditions spelled out in the
lease refer to_ the duration , the

   

 

amount of rent to be paid in
monthly installments, who is
responsible for utilities, the
amount of the security deposit and
who is responsible for repairs and
maintenance. The student should
read thoroughly and be familiar
with the terms of the lease before
signing it. It is often a good idea to
have someone from the Legal
Awareness Committee explain the
lease to the student as well. Once

Pitt Job

A lot of job juggling occured in
the administrative ranks at Pitt
during the summer. Consequently,
some notable persons have ﬁlled
new positions.

Nancy Evans has assumed new
duties as director of student
activities, succeeding Dan Meloro,
who resigned the position in
August to enter private business in
New Jersey.

A nine-member screening com- A

mittee, including four students,
evaluated applicants for the vaca-
ted position.

Evans has worked at Pitt since
August, 1975, as assistant director
of student activities working with
Student Government Board and
other student groups.

Prior to her employment at Pitt,
she was employed as a student
counselor at Wayne State Univer-
sity.

Former State Senator Thomas F.
Lamb has been appointed chief
lobbyist for Pitt, ﬁlling the position
of assistant vice" chancellor for
public affairs dealing with govern-
mental relations left vacant after
the death of Russell M. Arnold on
July 11, 1976.

Lamb served two terms in the
Senate and four terms in the
House.

While chairman of the House
Education Committee, he spon-

tures. it becomes a legally binding
contract that can be enforced in
court.

The security deposit is a sum of
money collected by the landlord,
the amount being set in the lease,
protecting him from damages
caused by a tenant’s irresponsibi-
lity, beyond normal wear and tear.
A good understanding ‘should be
reached between the landlord and
the student for the reasons an
assessment can be made against
the security deposit. It is also wise
for the ‘student to make a “check
list” of all the damages existing in
the unit and submit it to the
landlord before moving in. The
student should make two copies 0
the list, have the landlord sign each
and both should keep a copy on ﬁle.

This will protect the student from
damages that were present before
he moved in.

Repair and maintenance re-
quired by normal wear and tear
should always be reported to the
landlord. Be speciﬁc. If a faucet is
leaking and it appears to be a worn
washer, tell the landlord so. This
will give him a more accurate
understanding of the problem and
assist him in scheduling the repair

work.
The landlord should have the

Know

repairs made in a day-or two.

Unless the problem is really
severe, do not expect the landlord
to have the repairs made within an
hour or two after the phone call.
However, if the required mainten-
ance has not been attended to in a
reasonable length of time, without
a legitimate explanation, the
student should attempt to ﬁnd out
what is holding the work up. If this
doesn’t work, go to the Legal
Awareness Committee and let
them give it a try. They are
familiar with landlord’s stalling
maintenance or trying to pass the

buck and have ways to get the 

landlord to cooperate.

By law, landlords are required to
provide decent housing for human
habitation. If a student believes his
home is not ﬁt, he should invite his
landlord over for a look and discuss
with him at that time what action
can be taken to improve its
condition. It is often a foolish move
to contact an attorney or the health
department before speaking to the
landlord.

If, after contacting the landlord
about a particular unit's alleged
violation of county health standards
the landlord does not respond in a
favorable manner, the student
should go to the Legal Awareness
Committee. They are experienced
with health code violations and will
suggest a course of action_.

The student should never with-
hold rent for any violation of the
lease without permission of the
County Health Department. Rent
withholding without the consent
and supervision of the health
department is probably the quick-
est way a student can get himself
over his head in troubles with the
landlord and the law.

The Allegheny County Depart-
ment of Health has an effective
rent withholding program for
qualiﬁed tenants. However, it
applies only to violations of the

county health code and can be

Facts About Renting

(Continued from Page 7)

initiated only with their approval
and guidance. Students with
questions about rent withholding
may contact Legal Awareness first
and have the program explained to
them before contacting the health
department. Rent withholding is a
severe measure and often some
other course of action is more
appropriate.

Discrimination, though rarely
encountered by the Committee, is
also a problem students should
keep in mind. If a student believes
he has been denied housing as a
result of his sex, race, color,
religion or hational origin, he
should visit the ofﬁce and let them
assist the student with the proper
complaint procedure.

Subletting and assignment are
also points that students should
consider when renting off campus.
Subletting is a condition where a
tenant desires to move before the
term of his lease expires and is able

to ﬁnd someone to take his place.
The original tenant is still liable for
the rent and all other obligations of
the lease. It is the original tenant's
responsibility to make all arrange-
ments with the landlord and the
new tenant for the rental payments
and other lease obligations. If the
new tenant should fail to observe
any of the conditions contained in
the original lease, the original
tenant is ultimately responsible to
the landlord.

Assignment is a condition where
the new tenant takes over all rights
and responsibilities of the original
tenant, leaving the original free of
all obligations. Assignment is to
the advantage of the original
tenant, while subletting favors the
landlord.

Many leases contain clauses
restricting subletting and assign-
ment. Students should be sure to
understand these restrictions.

Lazarsfeld was the first recipient of
an honorary doctorate from the
newly formed university. He had
spent a year, from 1962 to 1963,. on
a sabbatical leave at the Sorbonne,
making a special study of the
history of social research in France.

He was born in Vienna in 1901
and received a Doctor of Philos-
ophy degree in mathematics awtwthe
University of Vienna. He taught
mathematics at the Junior College
in Vienna and psychology at the
Psychological Instituteof Vienna. ‘

Lazarsfeld also had been_chair-

‘ man of PittProfessor Paul Nyden’s

disseration committee at Columbia
University.

At hearings last spring into the
university decision .not to grant
Nyden tenure, Lazarsfeld strongly
criticized Nyden’s work, although
he had lavishly praised the same
work two years earlier.

Sociologists
May Support

Paul Nyden

(Continued from Page I)
said D’Antonio’s committee had
approved the resolution attacking
the university.

“That statement is totally‘

inaccurate,” he said, “the com-
mittee has taken no action at all on
the Nyden case.” . .
Nyden received support over the
summer from dissident United
Steelworker Ed Sadlowski, whosis
expected to seek the union’s
presidency now that I. W. Abel is
retiring. - -
Sadlowski, an outspoken critic of
Abel, said Nyden should be rehired
and more professors like Nyden

 should be found.

“People that fight for unions and
support struggles for better work-

. ing conditions always seem to get

shafted,” Sadlowski said in a
statement. 0

S.U. Office Holds 17 Groups

BY RICH HARRY

A newly established group office
in the Student Unioniwill accom-
modate 17 student organizations
for this school year.

The room, located in 306 Student
Union, will provide ofﬁce and
meeting space for the organiza-
tions. They will also have use of
storage and conference rooms and
office equipment. The groups will
share the room and each will be
alloted a speciﬁc time at which to
meet.

The decision to assign 17 student
groups to one room followed a
Student Affairs evaluation of office
locations in the Union. Student
Union Manager Terry Milani said
yesterday the group office is
designed for organizations with a
“periodic need” for a meeting

place. The organizations also met
criteria for ofﬁce allotment, accord-
ing to Milani.

Milani said that the demand for
student organization offices this
year exceeded the available space.

Two other student organizations
were forced to move because of the
allotment of the room. The Legal
Awareness Committee, which was
previously housed in 306, was
forced to relocate to another room
that was being used by the
Graduate and Professionsal Stu-
dents Association. The action, in
turn, prompted GOSA to be moved
to another office.

Michael Silverman, chairman of
Legal Awareness, said yesterday
he was satisfied with the com-
mitte’s new room. “At first I was
hesitant about the room,” he said.

“But I expect it to be a successful
move."

GPSA President Sandy DeBour-
lando also said she was satisfied
with the new room, despite a
protest her group issued against
the move in April.

The student organizations desig-
nated to the new group office are
the Pitt Road Racing Team, Alpha
Epsilon Delta, Minority Pre-Med,
Hill Education, Environmental
Action Club, Robin Hood’s Merrie
Band, Pitt Ski Club, Dental Science
Club, Zen Study Society, Bahai
Club, Faculty of Arts and Sciences
Graduate Student Organization,
Italian Club, Circle K, Young
Americans for Freedom, Pitt Scuba
Club, Student American Pharma-
ceutical Association and the Pitt
Bicycle Club.

SAMPLE PROBLEM NO. 1 ON THE SENIOR SCIENTIST

A lab experiment calls for determining the 4% of iron in an unknown
compound. You run the experiment 6 times and ‘obtain: 38.33%,
41.68%, 39.42%, 40.60%, 38.98%, and 39. 76%. Report the mean,
standard deviation, and the probability that the next experimental
result would fall be tween 39.00% and 40.00%.

a) Enter each data point using the 2+ key.
b) Depress the SE key and read the mean, >?=39.795.
cl Depress the 0' »key and read the standard deviation, o‘=1.196

d) Key in the equation Pr(40.00—33I — Pr(39.OQ':>-El using the Pr(x) key
0' O"

and read Prlxl = 0.3149. Note that we have eliminated entirely
the use of books of statistical tables for determining the values of
Prlxl and the necessity of time consuming calculations for the
standard deviation simply through use of the special keys on the
Senior Scientist.

SAMPLE PROBLEM NO.2 ON THE SENIOR SCIENTIST

Pittsburgh Welcomes Previn

BY PAMELA EUSI

Ahh September. The time for
baseball games, back to school and
golden days. It’s also the time for
the return of the Pittsburgh
Symphony Orchestra at Heinz Hall.

But this year in particular seems
to be the year of anniversaries and
there are enough to go around.
Notwithstanding the 200th anni-
versary of our good old USA, 1976
marks the 50th anniversary of the
Pittsburgh Symphony, the fifth_
anniversary of Pittsburgh's “Home
for the Arts”-Heinz Hall—-and on
the Symphony's ﬁrst program
appears Brahms’ First Symphony
which will soon be celebrating its
100th birthday.

The.Pittsburgh Symphony is also
celebrating the arrival of a new
music director who happens to be
none other than the world famous
Andre Previn. Previn has been
principal conductor of the London
Symphony since 1968 and will
continue in that capacity, ﬂying to
Pittsburgh to ﬁll his post as music
director succeeding the 24-year
reign of William Steinberg.

The 47-year-old Previn already
has sparked enthusiasm as a man
capable of many things. He is a
conductor who likes to compose,
his most recent works being a cello
concerto, a guitar concerto, two

. quintets for wind and brass and a

suite of preludes. Previn also is
scheduled as one of the guest piano
soloists with the Pittsburgh Sym-
phony.

Friday night will be the opening

- concert of this season and Previn is

already attracting a new crowd for
that night-——a live broadcast on
KDKA-TV. The concert will air at
8:30 p.m. and run for three hours.

The opening concert’s program
lists Hector Berlioz’ “Corsair”
Overture, Dmitri Shostakovich’s
Sixth Symphony and Johannes
Brahms’ First Symphony." Previn
wants to expand the standard 19th

Film Series

  At Carnegie
BY BECKY CRAFT

Start your weekend off right. A
new Friday afternoon ﬁlm series of
American classics will highlight
this season of the Carnegie

_ Institute Film Section.

The program will include such
hits as West Side Story (Sept. 10)’
Elia Kazan's East of Eden, starring
America's cult hero James Dean,
Alfred Hitchcock’s 1972 thriller
Frenzy and Mike Nichol's late 60's
classic The Graduate.

Featured in this series will be a
“Halloween Special"———a night of
horror classics such as The Night of
the Living Dead by I_’ittsburgh’s
own George Romero and a special
“Election Day Special" wih Frank
Capra’s infamous Mr. Smith Goes
to Washington (1939) with Jimmy
Stewart and Jean Arthur.

(Continued on Page 21)

century German repertoire to
include more Prokoﬁev, Shostako-
vich, Debussy, Walton and_Vaughn
-Williams.

The list of guest conductors for
the upcoming season includes
Rafael Kubelik, Andrew Davis and
William Steinberg. Some‘ of the
guest soloists will be Bolshoi opera
star Galina Vishnevskaya, violinists
Mayumi Fujikawa and Silvia
Marcovici, actress Mia Farrow (all
of the above making their
Pittsburgh premiere), Isaac Stern,

Misha Dichter and Vladimir Ash-
Lkenazy. p

' Heinz Hall has a long list of other
-attractions including the produc-
tion of the award winning drama
Equus,which will be staged in the
“3/4 round"), the Royal Shakes-
peare Production of Sherlock
Holmes and Neil Simon's Plaza
Suite. Comedienne Phyllis Diller
will play for two showson October
23 and the Fred Waring Show is
slated for October 25. The 1976-77
season at Heinz Hall should be
most interesting!

Anarchy Reigns In  

Pitt Drama Season

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

An-archy can be a good thing.
Take for instance the upcoming Pitt
Theatre season.

Oldtimers used to the “themat-
ic" structure of Pitt’s theatre
season may be discomﬁtted by the
realization that this year’s season
offerings will ﬁt no rational peg
board.

Breaking out of the thematic
habit could provide some freshness
to the upcoming round of plays,
however, beginning with ‘the fall
revival of this spring’s When Y0“
Comin’ Back Red Ryder?

"Red Ryder,” the award-win-
ning play of disruption in a quiet,
backwater Western town will bring
the same cast to the stage,
including English faculty member
Chris Rawson in the lead role as the
agent of chaos in an isolated greasy
diner.

PiH'sFaII Flicks Fumble

BY M. C. PILECKI

It's movie time again on campus,
from the sublime to the ridiculous
—but mostly the ridiculous.

Most of the ﬂicks on this term’s
calendar for the Franklin Pangborn
Thursday and Saturday Night
Series and the Student Union
Board’s Friday Night Series are
fairly recent releases—-—or escapees,
depending on your point ‘of
view—unless otherwise noted.
Reportedly due to a lack of good
movies available, this year’s
schedule
disappointing for ﬁlm afﬁcianados
in some time.

First, the Thursday ﬂicks.
begin in David Lawrence Hall at
8:30 p.m. Admission is $1.

September 16: Badlands. This
intellectual curiosity gave Martin
Sheen one of his best roles as a
neurotic caught up in a James Dean
world. He kidnaps a’ young woman
(Sissy Spacek), who ﬁnds herself in
his fantasy world. , It’s a strange
theme that enjoyed a brief spate of
popularity in later works.

September 23: Amarcord. Fed-
erico Fellini's gentle memory-ﬁlled
film of life in a small Italian village
is nostalgic and even touching
without getting sentimental, maud-
lin or heavy.

September 30: The Seventh Seal
(1956). Ingmar Bergman's most
ambitious film tells the tale of a
l4th century knight grappling with
death in some of cinema’s most
remembered scenes.

is one of the most‘

All -

October 7: Breathless (1959).
Jean-Luc Godard’s first feature
ﬁlm was a major inﬂuence on the
films of the sixties and established
him as a major artist in this tale of
a gangster and his American girl
‘friend.

October 14: Seven Beauties. Lina
Wertmuller has practically become
a household name in the past year,
and this, her most recent U.S.
release, rides high on that wave of
popularity (or notoriety). It’s a
bitter, but often hilarious account
of an Italian ne’er-do-well in the
second World War, with some
biting comments on the human
race. A
October 21: Sense of Loss.
Another effort by the director of
The Sorrow and the Pity, Marcel
Ophuls.

October 28:’ The Immigrants.
Troell’s epic of Swedish immi-
grants to America: In this story, a
peasant couple (Liv Ullmann and
Max von Sydow) court, wed, begin
to raise a family and then decide to
move to the new land. The scenes
on the boat and their cross-country
trek to Minnesota are the most
gripping in the movie.

November 11; Richard 111 (1956).
Laurence Olivier brought Shakes-
peare to the screen, and this is his
best effort at uniting ﬁlm and bard.
Olivier produced as well as acted
and directed.

Wertmuller’s tale of a shipwrecked
couple is either a brilliant political
statement or a cheap, horrid,

misogynistic ripoff. Whichever, it ‘

has never failed to produce violent
reactions from ﬁlm fans. Inciden-
tally, this is how Wertmuller
attained that household-word
status.

December 2: Murmurs of , the
Heart. By French director Louis
Malle, who also did Thief of Paris
and Lovers, among others.

December 9: Taking—Off. Milos
Forman’s ﬁrst American work he
has since done One Flew Over The
Cuckoo’s Nest.

That was the cream of the crop.
Now for the Friday night pits. All
ﬁlms areat 8 and 10:30 p.m. in
David Lawrence Hall. Admission is
50 cents in advance, 75 cents at the
door.

September 10: Blazing Saddles.
Still Mel Brooks’ most jam-packed
comedy, with laughs from start to
ﬁnish, and something to offend
everyone. The best Friday night
has to offer.

September 17: Spys, or s*p*y*s
(as it was plastered on the placards
in an attempt to cash in on the
popularity of m,a,s,h, with which it
isn't even remotely connected).
Robert Culp and Bill Cosby and
reunited in this spy spoof that
never really got off the ground.

September 24: The Longest
Yard. As long as you don’t take it
seriously, the ﬂick is pretty funny
about the antics of prison inmates
preparing for a football game. But
the allegories at the end get pretty
heavy. Still. Burt Reynolds
provides some pleasant scenery.

(Continued on Page 30)

Red Ryder is simply a man
trapped by the progress of time in a
place and life he would rather
change. The engrance of the
violent stranger destroys the bonds
that bind Ryder to the greasy diner
and the long evenings of slopping
hash.

If anything, Red Ryder is a play
about the increase of possibilities
fermented in the wake of sense-
lessness and, well, anarchy. A nice
way to ease those used to the
“theme” format into the rest of the
season.

Next on the schedule is a
production of The Merchant of
Venice, although Attilio Favorini of
the Pitt’s theatre department
indicated the interpretation will
skip the Renaissance gondolasand
rapiers for a more modern
approach.

Merchant will be the first Pitt
Mainstage Shakespeare in more
than three years, and the Novem-
ber 3 opening night will see the
return of Bill Wendt and Kate
Cook, Pitt alumni familiar from
their performances in Look Back In
Anger.

The third slot for a major
theatrical piece remains to be
filled, according to Favorini,

Dance Group

Sets Season.
Of Variety

BY LEAH McFARLAND

Dancers. Wrapped in gauzy
ﬂutters, they shine brieﬂy sur-
really, on far off famous stages,
unquestioned and untaught. Hard
to imagine that once they too might
have been at school. Impossible
that at 18, at 20, they might have
been at Pitt, preparing and
perfecting the magic they work
under the lights’ of those far away
stages.

Pitt has dancers. Pitt has a
Dance Ensemble. Pitt is presently
auditioning dancers for a touring
repertory company, which Pitt’s
Assistant Dance Instructor Mar-
garet Skriner believes could be-

.,come a growing, high-quality

dance company.

The Dance Ensemble is ﬁnaliz-
ing plans for a variety of
lecture/demonstrations,
performances and workshops to be
held on campus this fall. Many
events are free, or nearly so.

“The workshops we're offering
this fall would probably be of most
beneﬁt to those students with some
dancer training or background,”
said Skriner. “But for almost
anyone they will increase an
appreciation of the staging, light-
ing and setting involved with the
dance performance. Especially the
choreography workshop is more of
an experience thing.”

Workshops this season include:
Choreography, with Catherine
Posin, affiliate artist with the
Pittsburgh Dance Council, Sep-
tember ll, 18 and 20; Lighting for
Dance, with Rut Grauert, lighting
director for the nationally ac-
claimed Alvin Nickolis Dance
Company, beginning December 4;
Jazz, with Gus Giordano from
Chicago, whose dancers are often
on television shows such as the
Carol Burnett Show, in February,
and some type of ballet workshop
in April.

The fee for individual dance
workshops is $4.50. However, any

At Civic Arena

BY M. PATRICK IV-IONAHAN

It would be easy to chastise the
music and theatrics of New York’s
most famous heavy metal band,
KISS. To call their music
deafening, theatrics pure shctick

and entire concept juvenile, /would —

be a futile exercise in understate-
ment. But to call them stupid and
unprofessional would be a bare-
faced lie. '

Make no mistake about it, KISS
is about as subtle as a sonic boom.
Andllgranted, Kabuki facial make-

up, and grinding 110-decibel
punk-street rock beefed up with
horror-like theatrics (the band is
big on leather and ﬁre), may not
exactly send a college student
swooning. But for KISS, this is
hardly a problem.

Half of the 15,000 in attendance
at the Civic Arena last Saturday
night were under 17 years old. And

I haven’t seen such pure enthus-i

iasm fora band since the last time

Led Zeppelin played the Steel City.;

BY MREA CSORBA

Around the Pittsburgh art
circuit, the name "of painter Steve
Hankin has become practically
synonomous with ‘super realism.’ I
mean, have you ever seen a Hankin
abstraction or pop art piece? No,
but chances are, the realism
canvases that you have seen at
various art galleries are by this
young Shadyside artist who is fast
emergingas the area’s strongest
painter of the current realism
mode.

His trademark? Minute detail
executed with perfect fool-the-eye
technique that transposes reality
onto canvas with the closest
approximation brushes and acryl-
lics can give.

For a Museum of Art exhibition
in the Entrance Gallery, Hankin
has assembled the best of his last
ﬁve years’ work in super realism.
There you can see what astonishing
realness he simulates with simple,
genre-like scenes. Check out his
imitation of shadows, the buff on a
chess player’s. boots, his superb
capture of scuffed-up tennis shoes,
or the textured “hairy” forearms of
‘Dad.’ i

Take not of his excellent
rendition of the guitarist’s veined
hands as his ﬁngers stiffen into a
difficult cord. Feel the uncanny
realness with which the “Three
O’Clock” sunlight streams through
his violet sheer curtains, and
marvel at the skillfully painted light
from a bulb that seems to melt
through the lampshade.

Hankin reﬂexs life on canvas
with the tools of his medium. But
he is careful to hide any of their

tell-tale signs. In fact, at a foot or

two distance from thework, the life '

illusion of his ﬁgures is amazing.
Still Hankin encourages a closer
study of his paintings. “I like
people to peer close to study the
technique, or experience the
expressiveness and rhythm of the
strokes."

The culmination of his ﬁve years
of private technique study in
realism is perhaps best displayed
in his group portriat painting
entitled “July.” This faithful copy
of a juxtapositioned variety of ages
and races has the added intrigue of
a pastiche of faces, each marked as
a distinct personality type.

We recognize the society lady
through her self-assured, superior
smile and correct posture; we smile
at the clearly myoptic girl--with
glasses in hand; we empathize with
the blond haired ‘Squirrel Hill
woman’ (she's got to be a doctor’s
wife!) who sits in dejected
disappointment of life and react
warmly to the center ﬁgure—an old
man who seems to be a ship captain
retired from duty, who reads a
letter to the group gathered around
him. .

The variety is interesting, the
personality study arresting, but
Hankin doesn’t stop there. Figure
composition and delicate balance
between color areas moves our eye
around the painting withouiit once
losing continuity of visual stimuli.
Hankin stays our eye easily to give
the painting the attention it richly
deserves.

Here, too,  where painstaking
effort on detail is most poignantly
exhibited. Look closely at the
ribbed couch cover and be amazed

at the atience required to make the
thousands of ﬁne grooves with
undertone over the basic yellow of
the cover and the highlighting of
each line.

Contrary to the impression one

gets——that Hankin delights in
monotonous detail Copying-
Hankin holds detail to be a

cumbersome but necessary part of
his realism, and though it is a

- time-robber, he accepts this beast

of burden with the style patiently.
The exhibition will continue
through September 24th.

Super Realism--at its Best Ch"°9° Head‘ T°W°’d
Candy! and On New LP

BY TOM WASELESKI

Chicago X, Chicago.
Columbia Records, X698.

They've called it. invariably,
Chicago X——that much we expect-
ed. Then they took their logo and
cast it like yet another Hershey bar,
brown wrapper and all. Trouble is,
the music comes out a little too
sweet.

Pitt's’ Theatre Season

(Continued from Page 1‘ 9/

although debate centers now on the
Taming of the Shrew and another
old favorite.
’ To round out the larger
productions, the department will
present two one-act plays, and once
again anarchy and chance has
sparked a great potential.

The ﬁrst one-act offering will be
The Marriage of the Petit Bour-
geois by Bertholt Brecht, one of his
earlier pieces with satire undim-
med by a craftsman’s wisdom or
patience. V

To add to the ﬂavor of the
performance, it will be directed by
West German director Ulrich
Heissing of the State Theatre in
Hamburg Germany, courtesy of the
Germany’s Goethe Institute and
Pitt’s German department.

The second one-act offering will
be Bedtime Story by Shawn

O’Casey.

Off the Mainstage in Stephen
Foster ferments another season for
the Studio Theatre.

Framing the productions of
original plays, will be The Silver
Chord, Jaques Brel is Alive and
Well and Living in Paris, and the
possibility of a theatrical interpre-
tation of Herzog.

Aside from the entertainment
you pay to see (season subscrip-
tions will remain $4.00) the theatre
department's Instrucitonal Perfor-
mance Company is readying its
third season of mock-riots. organic
molecules and whatever else
faculty dream up as an aid to
instruction. 1

So all the tumult in the theatre
department may~come to some
unusual fruition. It promises to be a
season without convention. Theatre
unbound.

The album opens full-blown with
“Once or Twice,” 21 Poumlmgv
raucous rocker that glimmers like a

sign of heavier things to come. But
it’s downhill from there, to. reggae
and schmaltz and back again.

“You Are on My Mind,” written
by James Pankow (“Just You ’N’
Me," “Old Days"), sounds like
something off Chicago VI, soft
vocal, intermittently hard trum-
pets. “Skintight” is a little
heavier, if not because of the
economy of lyrics, then because of
the more prominent horn section.

“You Get It Up” features the
group in a collective sing that
comes off as close to jazzy soul as
this group’ll ever get, about a
hair’s width away from War.
“Scrapbook” is a strong disco
offering bv Robert Lamm who sees
ﬁt to reminisce on some of his
group’s touring adventures; the
lyrics might not be so bad if they
weren’t so .loaded with name
droppings, which in this case are as
aesthetically pleasing as those of a
pigeon.

The Remake of the Year Award
goes to terry Kath’s “Hope for
Love,” a swell copy of “Alma
Mater.” a song he wrote for
Chicago V. And on the gooey side
is “Another Rainy Day in New York
City” (such a wasted single), “If
You Leave Me Now,” and “Mama
Mama” (which both sound like
latter-day Beach Boys, and that
ain’t good).

Not only is it sweet, it gets
downright tacky.

Direction Saves Play
At Pgh. Lab Theatre

BY DAVID ASHLEY

The Pittsburgh Laboratory
Theatre in Oakland, which per-
forms in what used to be a chapel is
now in its ﬁfth season. The
theatre’s productions are always
experimental and usually innova-
tive. The spaces created in the
nave, balconies, cellar and various
rooms of the old church have been
well adapted to meet the needs of
the company who play (by choice)
to audiences rarely in excess of 30.

The first production of the PLT’s
new season is Vatzlav, by the
contemporary Polish playwright
Slawomir Mrozek. Apart from
Tango, written over 10 years ago,
Mrozek’s plays are almost com-
pletely unknown in the United
States. >

Described as a “political satire, ’ ’
Vatzlav, takes “justice” as its
central theme and though surreal-
ism and extended parody makes
mockery both of the perceived
inequities of an imaginary but
allegorical society and the propos-
ed remedies that fail to address
them.

Vatzlav is not a great play. Even
under the capable direction of Bill
Royston the middle part of the
drama drags and it is difﬁcult to
maintain interest in what is
occurring onstage. With theater of
this kind, a director always has to
tread a ﬁne line between, on one
hand, concentrating upon the
surrealistic and absurdist aspects
of the play and risk creating merely
a parody of the grotesque, or, on
the other hand, stressing too
heavily the abstracted intellectual
_ _

theme of a production, thus
creating a great deal of philosophi-
cal baggage that tends to be
cumbersome without being
weighty.

Royston has successfully balan-
ced the two extremes in this case,
and, in addition, gathers for his
audience nuances and subtleties
that under less capable direction
would probably have been lost.

Vatzlav takes place in the cellar
_of the Lab Theatre's church, which
provides chairs for members of the
audience seated at both ends of a
central space bisected by blocks on
which other less fortunate play-

. goers sit, squat or lie as they turn

to view action that occurs on either
side of them.

The lighting for this production
was very subdued and at times
inadequate to show clearly the
faces of players only 20 feet away.

The individual performances of
the cast of 13 are of very high
quality. David Crawford is
convincing as Vatzlav and Jack
Slotnick Chris Blaetz, Robin
Robinson and Ray Leghart give
stellar performances. "Trish Begly
as Justice performs a delightful
strip-tease, permitting the common
people, as Genius (Joe Obuehow-
ski) carefully explains, to gaze
fondly upon her charms,‘ not to
mention a G-string of regrettably
expansive proportions.

Overall Vatzlav works because it
is done with enthusiasm and
intelligence. Better an innovative
and compelling production of a less
than perfect script than a mediocre
performance of theater in the first
rank.

BY CRIS HALL

What's this? Johnny Majors, a
man who shows no hesitation while
berating his 250-pound linemen,
afraid of leprechauns?

Well, not exactly. Pitt's head
coach is not so much afraid of Irish
spies as he is of the beneﬁt Notre
Dame coach Dan Devine might
receive if the spies’ reports reach
South Bend.

Who will start at quarterback for Pitt this Saturday
at Notre Dame is not certain, but whether it’s junior
Matt Cavanaugh [left] or senior Bobby Haygood
[right], he’ll be handing frequently to running backs

Coaches Agree:

BY CRIS HALL

Johnny Majors and his counter-

'> part at Notre Dame, Dan Devine,
...., admitted yesterday what everyone



else has been saying for months——
Saturday’s affair at South Bend will
be a big game.

“I think it will be a big ballgame
for both of us," Majors said at the
weekly pre-game luncheon at the
Greentree Holiday Inn. “This year
it will be a big game not only for us
at Pitt, but for Notre Dame also."

‘‘It’s just as big for us as it is for
Pitt," Devine agreed by telephone
hook-up. “and it's a big game for
Pitt.”

The second-year Irish coach said
he believed the Pitt encounter to be
a “must" for his squad.

“This game will probably in-
ﬂuence the national rankings,"
Devine said. “The winner will sure
feel good," he said, “but both
teems know the loser could ﬁnish
10-1 so they won’t fold up the
tent.”

Majors used the same phrase
when describing possible post-

, game effects.

.O

Q.

Pitt's head coach pointed to the

 5!, .,-...-_..._.. “

So much of Pitt's pre-season
practice has been a family affair.
The “family” in this case is a select
group of players, coaches, staff,
media and, of course, members of
the Golden Panthers booster club.

Practices during the two weeks
at Pitt's Johnstown campus were
open only to the above group, with
the exception of a Saturday
scrimmage which was held on a
high school ﬁeld.

abundance of experienced Pan-
thers and said he hoped the team
would be mature enough to accept
a loss and not fold up that tent.

While both coaches talked about
contingency plans for after a loss,
Majors added that he does not plan
to lose at South Bend. “I don't
know what all I'd give if I could win
that game,” he said. “We want to
win the hell out of the game.”

Devine, who has run into some
criticism from Irish fans after a
“so-so” 8-3 record last season, also
would like to win the game and is
taking some of the precautions
Majors has been using in an effort
to keep the enemy guessing .

“It's difﬁcult to have a closed
practice at Notre Dame," Devine
said. “But they’re normally a little
more open than they are this
week."

Does Devine have any spies
ﬂoating around Oakland on recon-
naisance missions?

“None that we can depend on,"
he laughed. Turning serious, he
continued, “I don't think the game
will be decided anywhere but on
the ﬁeld of Notre Dame stadium
starting at 3:20 p.m. Saturday.”

Majors used the relative privacy
of the serene country campus to
open up his offense and round a
team that showed up in surprising-
ly good shape into even better
condition.

He also made a few lineup
changes before heading to Pitts-
burgh last Wednesday. Junior J.C.
Wilson went to Johnstown a

second-team cornerback and left
camp playing with the ﬁrst team at

 

Tony Dorsett and Elliott Walker [center], who appear
ready to take on all comers. Kickoff is scheduled for
3:20 p.m., with the game to be televised by ABC.

It’s A Big Game

PITT NOTES——A separated
shoulder will definitely keep
backup Irish quarterback Joe
Montana of Ringgold High School
out of the game. Injured Irish who
should be ready for Saturday
include halfback Jerome Heavens,
who had a foot stepped on in a
scrimmage last Saturday and did
not practice Monday, and punter/
second-team safety Joe Restic, who
twisted an ankle in a recent
practice...Devine said yesterday
that he was misquoted by a
Midwest writer who quoted him as
saying to Irish boosters, “I
guarantee you one thing-—Tony
Dorsett won't gain 300 yards
against :1. this year.” “I know
better than to say something like
that," Devine said...Elliott Walker
worked out in sweat pants Monday
and seems to be recovering from a
sprained ankle quickly enough to
make it probable he will play
Saturday...Walker ran 50-yard
sidelines and did other exercises
while his teammates on the offense
ran) through a light Monday
workout...All practices at Pitt
Stadium are closed to the public,
including students.

the same position. Bob Jury,
Wilson's predecessor, moved to
safety, demoting Mike Balzar.

Jim Cramer performed well in
camp and reasserted his hold on
the linebacking position opposite
Arnie Weatherington while Cecil
Johnson's knee stayed well enough
to let Johnson hold onto a spot at
first-team defensive end, a position
that remains the biggest problem
on the team.

Sophomore walk-on Mike Lenos-
ky, a former linebacker, worked out
at defensive end with the ﬁrst team
during the last week of camp but an
ankle injury has him on crutches.
An anticipated switch to defensive
end by 6-6 junior defensive tackle
Randy Holloway, a move which
would open a spot for sophomore
David Logan, failed to come about.

A wealth of returning veterans
(18 starters and both kickers
returned) kept freshmen out of the
starting lineup, but Majors' fourth
batch of recruits looked eager and
able to fill in if an opening appears.
First-year back Jo Jo Heath of
Monesson should see some
action returning kicks.

spot on the ﬁrst-team offense) but
will not start because of Gordon
Jones and Willie Taylor, a pair of
talented receivers.

Jones was one of many Panther
front-liners to be hit with injuries at
Johnstown, but, as with most of the
wounded Panthers, there's no
doubt he’ll start at South Bend.

Jones had, at various times, an
injured thumb, a sprained ankle
and a groin pull. Tony Dorsett’s
annual camp injury was a minor
sprained thigh muscle, but run-
ningmate Elliott Walker’s sprained
ankle is no laughing matter. He's
working out, however, and should
be able to join Dorsett in Pitt’s
least part time
Saturday.

Junior halfback Leverga Walker,
Elliott's brother, looked ready to

bid for playing time until someone
stepped on his ankle during a
scrimmage. He's available to ﬁll in
for the starting backs when Bob

‘Hutton (recovered from a bruised
back) isn't.

Tackle John Hanhauser injured a
ﬁnger midway through camp but
X-rays were negative and he’s back
to 100 percent. Center John Pelusi
and tackle Joe Stone were hit by
shoulder injuries; Pelusi will play
Saturday. Stone's status is not as
certain.

On defense, Al Romano, Arnie
Weatherington and Jury were
among those bothered by assorted
ailments, but the entire unit should
be ready for Jerome Heavens, Al
Hunter and the rest of the Irish.

The team, which worked out
twice daily during most of the stay
at Johnstown, is currently conduc-
ting one-a-days at Pitt Stadium.
This week is being devoted more to
healing than hitting, but security
hasn't eased—-—it's tightened. Now,
even Golden Panthers are being
turned away at the gate by a
Pinkerton man.

In addition, reporters have been
asked not to interview players until
after the Notre Dame game unless
a member of Pitt's sports informa-
tion departent is present.

Majors reportedly has gone so
far as to put a manager in the Pitt
Stadium stands whose duty is
searching out neighboring highrise
buildings for unwanted eyes.
Majors ﬁgures—correctly——that he
will be able to use every advantage
he can get at Notre Dame Stadium.
Notre Dame has won more than 83
percent of its home games in 89
years at South Bend. That's quite a
tradition to uphold—one that was
dented a bit last year by Pitt and
Dorsett’s long-to-be-remembered
303 yards on the ground.

The Irish remember that 34-20
loss (“Last year's game is still in
the back of everybody’s mind,”
quarterback Rick Slager said. ‘‘I
will prepared for that game all
summer...we will be primed for
it.") and are mindful of the fact 80
percent of the country will be able
to watch the game on ABC-TV.

So Pitt's Majors has spent the
past few weeks preparing to carry
on a budding Pitt tradition——and
he's not about to let any Irish spies
stand in his way.

Kickers Taking Aim For Last shot at Pitt

Long Ready for Season, Pros

' Carson Long has not mellowed.
Rumors that Pitt's place-kicking
sensation lost his ﬂakiness after his
disappointing performance in last
year's Penn State game can be put
to rest.

Surrounded by the other kickers
on the Panther roster in his
Johnstown training camp room.
Long responded to every question

s-\'VIth a quip. Asked about his

t

kickoffs. he assumed a Groucho
Marx pose and said, “I have
nothing to kick about."

But there are some questions
Long will not answer. not even
jokingly. In Pitt's‘ 7-6 loss to Penn
State last season, Long missed
three ﬁeld goals in the closing
minutes. any one of which would
have given Pitt a victory. _
L; ‘‘I won't talk about that." he

said emphatically. “I don't talk

 

about the good things I did last
season, either.'.'

“I don't like to live in the past,"
he insisted. “If you go to my home
in Ashland (Pa). you won't see a

Swider Seeks “Hidden Yardage”

BY RON SIEGEL
The kicking game. Johnny
Majors calls it the “Hidden

yardage." Since Majors arrived at
Pitt three years ago. he has had
only one punter, 21-year-old Larry
Swider. Majors couldn't ask for a
much better one.

Swider's high, booming kicks
have been longer and more
consistent each year. The Panthers
.were eighth in the country last
season with a 39.4 net punting
average. Swider's 58 punts aver-
aged 40.8 yards, and none were
returned very far.

But the 6-2 Dubois High
graduate's biggest moment at Pitt
came on a play when the ball never
touched his talented right toe. In
last season's l9-9 win over
Georgia, Swider brilliantly took a

safety late in the game. rather than

attempting to punt off a bad snap.
The move saved the win.

Swider isn't the only talented
punter in camp, but he is the only
one with varsity experience.
Quarterbacks Tom Yewcic, Wayne
Adams and Woody Jackson were
impressive while punting in train-
ing camp. but Swider isn't
concerned.$

“When you get in that ﬁrst
game. it's a whole new ball game,"
he said between practice sessions
at Pitt's Johnstown training camp.
"They're gonna feel the pressure
and hear the crowd. It took me a
whole half of a a season before I got
used to it."

Swider is hoping to add a new
dimension to the Pitt kicking game
this season-the intentional out-of-
bounds punt.

“Coach Majors helped me a lot

on out-of-bounds kicks." he said.

 

“He was one of the best there ever
was in college (Tennessee). We'll
probably go for out-of-bounds kicks
:1 lot this season. There's no way
for a return on them. and while you
do lose a chance for a fumble. most

Out Of Bounds

teams let kicks inside the ten go,

anyway.”

A constant companion of place-
kicker Carson Long, Swider is a
clown__, when around Long, but
serious when away from him.

“I think that everybody can joke

- around to an extent," he said. “It

keeps you loose. When it comes to
football though, it’s all business.”

As the player closest to Long,
Swider knows as well as anyone
about how Carson recovered from
that excruciating 7-6 loss to Penn
State. Long will not discuss the

subject.
“He got over it,” assured‘
Swider. “Different people take

different amounts of _time. Natur-
ally, he ‘was hurt by it. After a
while, we just quit talking about it.
The only time the subject comes up
is when people are doing a story on
it. But like Carson says, that's in
the past. You have to forge ahead
into the future." \
Swider is hoping the future will

find him playing professional
. football. “I’m looking for some-

thing better than a nine-to-ﬁve day.
Maybe I'm a dreamer. Right now, I
want to make the pros.”

When Swider arrived at Pitt, he
wanted to play defensive back as
well as punt. After apparently
injuring his knee while intercepting
his first pass in practice, Majors
decided Swider would do nothing
but punt. The senior accepts this.

“I realize my best opportunity to
help this team is by kicking,” he
said.

He has developed each year,
improving himself mentally along

recalled. “After a bad game, I

wouldn't eat, wouIdn’t talk to
anybody. As I grew older, I got out
Of that.” '

Against Southern California two
years ‘ago, Swider sliced a
25-yarder out of bounds. His next
kick went 69 yards, the best of his
career. ‘ .

Larry Swider came to Pitt
because of Johnny Majors’ “crips
approach" to football, and because
he liked to see an underdog knock
off a favorite. It is because of
players like Larry Swider that Pitt
is rarely an underdog these days.

Pitt Lifting More Than Hopes

BY RON SIEGEL

The 1976 Pitt football team may
not be the most successful in the
school's history, but it undoubtedly
is thestrongest. The 1910 Panthers
didn't yield a point on their ‘way to
a perfect season. Pitt weightlifting,
however, isat an all-time high.

In Johnny Majors"ﬁrst year at
Pitt, only three players could
bench-press 300 pounds. In 1974,
six could do it. Thirty-two did it last

year, and a phenomenal 44 can do

it now.
Majors gives credit for the
weightlifting program to head

trainer Tim Kerin, who organized
the program and supervises it.$
“Two years ago, we lost four
games because teams physically
beat us,” Kerin explained. (The
‘teams were North Carolina State,
Penn State, USC, and Notre Dame)
“The players realized it wasn't
worth getting their heads beat in.”
The result was a weight program

DUFFERS CALLED
With the Pitt golf season. set to

open Sept. 20, Coach Steve Petro
invites all prospective golfers who
would like to make the team of 12 to
attend an organizational meeting at
5 p.m. Monday, Sept. 13, at the
Field House.

‘that the players believed in. It took
two years tgjsell the entire team on
lit. The results have been excellent,
and the Panthers’ strength is equal
to or stronger than that of almost
any college football team.

The training begins in the
winter, with players reporting
voluntarily three times a week. It
concludes six weeks before training
camp starts. Exercises include the
bench press. quarter squat, dead
lift and power clean.

“Our goals are strength and
bulk," Kerin said. “We try to get
as much as we can. Ifa player has a
speciﬁc problem, like a sore
shoulder, we have special exercises
for that."

The top weightlifters on the team
are 6-2, 240-lb. guard George Link,
and 5-11, 225-lb. linebacker Gary
Tyra. Kerin says Tyra has aslight
edge at‘ the moment. Both can
bench press over 400 lbs., and
power clean more than 300.

Two of the more surprising

weightlifters are wide receiver
Gordon Jones and defensive
lineman Randy Holloway. Jones, a
6-1. 190-pounder, can bench-press
295 pounds, and is pound-for-
pound the strongest player on the
team. Holloway, whose 6-6, 228-lb.
frame is not conducive to lifting,
has added 15 pounds to his best
mark and can now bench-press 320
lbs. Kerin rates him the most
improved lifter.

Other bench press figures are
235 for Robert Haygood and 275 for
Tony Dorsett and Matt Cavanaugh.

“Most of these kids never lifted
weights until they got to Pitt,"
Kerin said. “All their lives they
were told not to lift weights.”

Kickers receive special exercises
for their legs, with the emphasis on
flexibility and stress.

It was obvious Pitt was not being
physically beaten many times last

' season, but Kerin would not point

to a specific game that was won by
weightlifting, declaring only that
it's “a part of the whole program.”

trophy or game ball or anything like
that, I gave them all away.

“If you have a good game today,
it's not going to help ‘you next
week. lt’s only for the moment.

“It's like the 52-yarder against
Notre Dame two years ago. Larry
(Swider) and I were real happy, but
it was over after the kickoff.’

Obviously remembering some
good things, such as the,52-yarder,
Long also relishes the tradition of
the Green Bay Packers.

“Green Bay is my choice for the
pros,” he admitted, “but I’d play
anywhere. Pro football is my goal. I
think it should be the goal of every
player." ,

Long said he believes a good
senior year will result in his
becoming‘ a high draft pick. In
preparation for professional foot-
ball, he has been decreasing the
thickness of his place-kicking tee
each year. He started, as a

 

freshman, with a two-inch tee, and
is now down to a platform
one-quarter ince high. Onlv kickoff

tees are allowed in the National -

Football League.

“A quarter-inch tee is like no
tee," said Long. “I’lI use this to
keep Coach Majors happy.”

Long has not been practicing
much this year at training camp.
He said he believes a kicker should
do most of his practicing during the
off-season, then just work on his
timing at camp.

“A concert pianist doesn"t
practice a half-hour before a
concert." he noted. '

Long sets goals for himself on all
aspects of his kicking'game, but the
holder of almost every Pitt
place-kicking record will not reveal
them. Only ‘he will know if he
reaches those goals. And only he
will know if revenge against Penn
State is among them.

BY STEVE SYBERT

With the start of another Pitt
football season comes the perennial
barrage of letters. stat sheets and
press guides that sports informa-
tion directors at opposing schools
spent hour upon hour researching,
checking. writing and rewriting for
the nation's reporters.

So, in order to not let those
efforts go to waste. some informa-
tion the average fan would like to
know has been assembled. The
following is a preview of what to
expect from the opposition the
Panthers will be facing in 1976.

NOTRE DAME—The Fighting
Irish are, of course, one of the
Panthers’ two very tough op-
t ' 1976 After last ear’s

 

NOTRE DAME END McAFEE

34-20 embarrassment, they will be
out for revenge in what should be
Pitt’s hardest hitting contest.

With 41 lettermen returning,
including 15 starters. the Irish are
bringing back enough youth that
may put them back on top in a year
or so. But, it won't be this year.
Notre Dame has three tough
opponents—Pitt, Alabama, and
Southern Cal———it probably can't
handle.

Fullbacks Jerome Heavens and
Jim Browner are coming off ﬁne

0 PITT

rookie seasons and will team with
Al Hunter to give the Irish their
perennially strong backfield.

Quarterback Rick Slager will be
tossing to All-America candidate
end Ken MacAfee. But the front
line’s inexperience could pose a
problem. Standout guard Ernie
Hughes is the only veteran there.

With eight starters back of
defense, it will be tough for
Dorsett, Walker and 'crew to
penetrate the front wall and reach
the open ﬁeld. And if they do,
defensive back Luther Bradley will
be there waiting. Probable ﬁnish,
8-3.

GEORGIA TECH—With the
third most potent offense in the
country last season practically
dissolved, the Yellow Jackets face at
year of rebuilding after posting a
7-4 record. Both experienced
quarterbacks and four starters from
the offensive line graduated,
leaving center Leo Tierney, an
All-America candidate, and half-
back David Simms the tough job of
making Tech respectable against
some good opponents.

Fifty-one vets are returning,
including honorable mention All-
America linebacker Lucius San-
ford, who averaged 12 tackles per
game a year ago. The Panthers
head a long list of stiff opposition
for the Yellow Jackets, which
includes Georgia, Navy, Notre
Dame, Auburn and Tennessee.
Probable ﬁnish, 6-5.

TEMPLE—Pitt’s home opener
will be against a team which won
its ﬁnal ﬁve games in 1975, though
Delaware, Dayton, Rhode Island,
Drake and Villanova are not exactly
in a class with Notre Dame and
Penn State. And after last year’s
55-6 romp in Philly, the Owl’s
would be wise to reconsider t '

    

practice of challenging the upper-
class teams.

Only 28 vets are returning from a
6-5 squad, including play-caller Pat
Carey and running back Bob
Harris. Carey, a transfer from Pitt.
passed for over 1,300 yards as a

junior last season. Probable ﬁnish,
5-5.

DUKE—~0nly two ties kept the
Blue Devils from an unblemished
Atlantic Coast Conference card and
a share for the title with Maryland.
But Duke won only once outside the
ACC, over Army. They should
contend again but may not improve

upon last year’s 4-5-2 overall
ﬁnish.
At quarterback will be a

sophomore, Mike Dunn, who will
join All-ACC center Bill .Bryan, an
All-America hopeful, and Carl
McGee, a freshman All-America in
1975, as the Blue Devils’ top
prospects. Probable ﬁnish, 5-6.

MIAMI [FLA.]—-The Hurrican-
es, 2-8 last year, faced one of the
toughest schedules in the nation
and will again in 1976. Eddie
Edwards, considered the best
defensive tackle ever at Miami,
heads a cast of 15 returning
starters.

On offense, the Hurricanes have

 

four runners in the backﬁeld timed

8 honors.

under 4.5 in the 40. but it will take
more than that to take on a card
which shows at least six top twenty
teams. Probable ﬁnish, 4-7.
NAVY—The winner of the
Commander-in-Chief's Trophy as
the service academy with the best
record, the Midshipmen upset the
Panthers 17-0 en route to a 7-4
slate. Nine starters from the
defensive unit that was ranked
third in the country are gone, as is
the Academy’s second all-time
leading rusher, Bob Jackson.
Returning on offense are
quarterback John Kurowski, wing-
back Joe Gattuso and tight end
Kevin Sullivan. Defensively,

.middle guard Jeff Sapp ranks as
Zone of the best in the nation.
‘ Probable ﬁnish, 6-5.

SYRACUSE—Two years ago, the
Orangemen were 2-9, but re-
bounded to ﬁnish as one of the
most improved teams in the
country last year at 6-5. Forty-one
vets are returning, including
defensive back Larry King, an All
America candidate, and sophomore
place-kicking sensation Dave
Jacobs, also hopeful of post-season
Probable ﬁnish, 5-6.

ARMY——,The Cadets, at 2-9, lost
28 lettermen and it may have been
just -as well. After taking the
opening two contests last- year
against Holy Cross and Lehigh,
Army slid to nine downfalls in a
row against tougher enemies.

Returning are quarterback
Leamon Hall, destined to become
Army's all-time leading passer,
and a solid front wall, led by
defensive end Stan Ford. In other
departments, the Cadets are in real
trouble. Probable ﬁnish, 3-8.

WEST VIRGINIA——Only eight
starters are returning from the

Bobby Bowden to Florida State.

Peach Bowl MVP Dan Kendra, a
junior qliarterback, is back, along
with end Tommy Bowden. Both
the offensive and defensive lines
lack depth, which was so bountiful
last season. Probable ﬁnish, 7-4.

PENN STATE—The loss of
kicker Chris Bahr through gradua-
tion, plus injuries to running backs
Duane Taylor and Larry Suhey,
could hamper the once-powerful
Nittany Lions. The Sugar Bowl
losers have 11 vets returning, but
only four on defense, usually the
team’s strong point.

they were more like hapless fags.
KISS offered an alternative.

Although they wear make-up
(the classic stereotype), KISS come
off like crazed macho lugs, whose
primary appeal is as larger than life
fantasy figures.

In fact, all four members of the
band exude a distinct and
individual stage personality.
Bassist Gene Simmons spits blood

his chest, leads the cheers, and

of KISS and musically the most
proﬁcient on his instrument. A
10-year veteran of a multitude of
New York polka, jazz, rhythm and
blues and rock bands, Criss admits
he played in “every high school
and bar in- New York” before
ﬁnally ﬁnding the goldmine with
KISS. And it is Criss, pain-ted
whiskers and all, who acts as the
cool stabilizing inﬂuence on his
younger cohorts in craziness.

And last Saturday night at the
Arena it was indeed crazy.

Kiss’s set consisted of loud,
raucous heavy metal, and well-
timed audience pleasing theatrics
(smoking guitars, lightning bolts,

‘levitating drums and ﬁre cauld'~

rons, to name a few) and plenty of
energy. To put it bluntly, KISS put
out. ‘They prahced, sweated, and
rocked for a solid hour and a half

LEGIONNAIRES DISEASE STILL
A MYSTERY

HARRISBURG (AP)——Medical
investigators have failed to ﬁnd any
nickel in initial. tests on hair
samples taken from living victims
of the mysterious legionnaires
disease, the state Health Depart-
ment announced Tuesday.

Teste were done on 13 samples.
taken from victims and nonvictims,
that were sent to a laboratory at
Harvard University in two ship-
ments during late August.

Scientists ‘had hoped the tests
would help substantiate earlier

' ﬁndings of unusually high nickel
. levels

in body tissues from
deceased victims. ‘

Because of possible contamina-
tion from containers and instru-
ments, the tissue tests have been
inconclusive ‘so far. '

The Center for Disease Control
still lists 29 deaths among the 179
cases related to the pneumonia——
like disease that first attacked
members of the American Legion
who attended a state convention in

Philadelphia in July.
