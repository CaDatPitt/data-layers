ters of the group for helping to orga-
nize protest postcards, which will be
mailed to President Barack Obama.

' City council members Bill Peduto,
Darlene Harris and Doug Shields and
state Rep. Dan Frankel, D-Allegheny
County, marched behind the drumbeat
provided by the Guinea West African
Drum and Dance Ensemble.

They marched from the City-
County Building to Mellon Park,
where they held a concert and Suda-
nese community leaders spoke about
the conﬂict. ..

Allegheny County councilman Bill
Robinson said local officials and ac-
tivists should make sure G-20 world
leaders know Pittsburgh cares about
Darﬁir.

“I don’t want them to think they
can just duck under a table and have
agood time,” Robinson said. ~

Many of the marchers held signs
with names of some of the 3,300
villages that have been destroyed in

. Sudan during the conﬂict. Bystand-

ers tookpictureswiththeir BlackBer—
rys.
Lastyear, the International Crimi-
nalCourt charged Sudanese President
Omar al—Bashir with crimes against

humanity.

Leju—Lodingsaid al—Bashir andhis
regime inSudan’s capital, Khartoum, is
uyingto destabilize the southern part
of the countryto suppress people’s re-
sistance to the current dictatorship.

Sudan’s north is dominated by
lighter-skinned Muslims who prefer
tobecalledArabs, while ChristianAf—
ricans inhabit the south and the west
in Darfur, Leju-Loding said.

Many Americans don’t realize the
differences between the peoples of
Sudan and how they identify them-
selves, he said. A

“It’s not the [skin] color, the phe-
notype,” he said. “It’s the people’s
mindset.”

When Leju-Lodingimmigratedto
the United States, it was a different
time in Sudan. The country had yet
to enter civil war. S

He said the Khartoum regime now
resists Christian dissent toward Sha-
riah law, which he said includes rules
that lowered the status ofwomen and
implemented severe punishments for

trivial crimes. It also supplies militias i

like the janjaweed; which destabilize
the regions by rapingwomen and Idli-
ing people in villages.

The government makes it diffi-
cult for Sudanese people to vote for
secession because it doesn’t want to
lose oil interests in southern Sudan
or rubber resources in Darfur, Leju-
Loding said. A

Now safe in the United States,
Leju-Loding said heworries abouthis
mother; who still lives in Sudan. .

, Bulletfragments hit her leg during
part of the violence, and she still suf-
fers painfrom herwounds. Leju-Lod-

ing said he doesn’t know ifhis mother’
can obtain adequate hospital care.

He said he also worries that the
Obama administration will use the
Sudanese peopleas“guineapigs”inits
eifortto demonstrate its commitment
to  peace with'Muslims,
despite Obama’s promise to help the
region. , "

“Pressure from the U.S. is crucial,
because if it doesn’t do anything, its
reputation [for human rights] is on
the line,” he said. '

Students have been important to
helping the Sudanese in Pittsburgh
and their cause; Leju-Loding added.

“Students are helping a lot,” he
said. ‘_‘But we’d love for that number
to expand.” _ y 1

Once it’s ﬁnished, organizationswill

be able to, arrange temporary use of
computers and telephones for man-

agement activities withareceptionist.

Humphrey said this system is similar
to those at other universities.

In a smaller room adjacent to the.
reception and computer area will be
storage and workspace. There will
be an island counter in the center for
poster-maldng and other activities, as
well as stackable storage boxes of dif-
ferent sizes alongthe walls.

Student groups that used the ﬁfth
ﬂoor were movedto the ninth ﬂoor.

Anthony Lyas, oftheFreedom Hon-
or Society, saidhis organizationlearned
it was being reassigned to the ninth
ﬂoorthrough e—mail and that its mem-
bers were not informed of plans.

He said it was diﬁicult for visitors
to ﬁnd his group, which has been det-
rimental to the organization.

But Matt Grau, of Pitt’s Rowing
Club, said he was satisﬁed with the
process.

“Movingﬂoors didn’t alfectusthat

. much,” he said. “We found the Union

staff to be very helpful.”
The University experimentedwith,.
and sometimesnixed,several ideas for

' theproject. ' - L '

Humphrey said she talked to hun-
dreds of students at various meetings
and asked what they needed in the

Union. An idea for a relaxation area j
translated into false rumors of a spa .

beingbuilt on theﬁfthﬂoor.
Humphrey said ultimately, she
found that students wanted the space
toorganizeandcoordinatetheiractivi-
ties. StudentGovernmentBoardmem-

berssaidtheywanted more storage and

office space for campus organizations.

Other students saidtheywanted more

hard surface ﬂoors for dance groups.
Humphrey also said these rooms
will have a more modern look.

. “It will be blue and gold with a’

twist,” she said. “It’s kind of funky.”
She said the renovation project
was planned along with renovations
ofthe sixthﬂoor and Nordy’s Place, but
thatittookawhileto coordinate ideas.

She said she was hoping to organize-

an open house when everything was
ﬁnished.
Humphrey said one of the most

important parts of her job is to help ’

students get connected to organiza-

tions like those using the new space.

Obama would come around and support the
single-payer system, in which all medical fees
are paid from a government or government-
related source.

Obama is slated to speak today at the sec-
ond day of the convention, for which the AFL-
CIO will hold ‘events throughout the week.

.. “The president is a good basketball player,

I ear G—20 protesters,
D Welcome to the City of
Champions. As you might
have heard from G-20 Summit
planners, Pittsburgh is one of the
world’s most progressive cities —
that surprised us, too.

We read in the Post-Gazette
that many of you have yet to
secure sleeping arrangements,
even though the Summit was an-
nounced in May. It sounds like
you could use a few tips to make

, your visit more successful:

We understand you.are ask-

ing the city to set up makeshift, .

outdoor campgrounds for your
organizations throughout Point
State Park or Schenley Park. In-

stead, ask freshmen to sign you ’

into their dorms.

They might ﬁnd your counter-
culture image alluring and want
to spend two nights discussing
Che Guevara and Rage Against
the Machine.

In case you ha_ven’t heard,

' Pennsylvania is broke.

Currently, we’re the only state
in the nation without an approved
budget. Pittsburgh Mayor Luke
Ravenstahl is the only person
who gets free stuff around here.
Maybe he can score you some
sweet Steelers tickets.

Pittsburgh doesn’t have a pub-
lic urination law yet — though
one could be voted on today — so
you might not need bathrooms for
your camps, anyway. Technically,
though, a state law still punishes
lewd conduct — a gamble you
must decide whether to take.

Speaking of gambling, we have
a new casino. ‘

‘If daddy needs a new pair of
Doc Martens, play the slots and
computer games. But you can’t

play table games — they’re for «

sinners and West Virginians.

You must call cabs here; you.

can’t hail them. They don’t stop.

It’s not because you look suspect.
It’s just the rule, and it makes per-
fect sense.

If you’re hunting for semi-hot
meals, look no further than Pitt’s
own Market Central.

Get those aforementioned I

freshmen to sign you in as a
guest. Then,’ have some after-
dinner downtime in the com-
muter lounge at Nor-dy’s Place.

Chat about revolution and human s

rights with students taking Intro
to Philosophy. Each is assuredly
something of an expert.

. If the tear gas starts to sting,
tell Pitt you have swine ﬂu.

The University will probably
send masks to you —- and semi-
hot meals —— so long as you re-
frain from any human contact.
Cityiofﬁcials are already con-
cerned that your encampments
will degrade into “swine flu
breeding grounds,” according
to the Post—Gazette, so why not
make the best of it‘? 7

All the good parties are
hosted by the lumpenproles of
South Oakland. BYOB. It’s like
Pittsburgh’s' version of Tijuana,
where the bourgeois travels for
taboo fun.- ' "

It’s cash only at Par_ne_la’s Diner,
the favorite Pittsburgh restaurant
of President Obama. You might
remember him from the efﬁgies
you’re burning.

You might have heard the ru- '

mors that Pittsburgh was only
asked to host the G-20 after New
York and Chicago declined. If it’s
true, that is still OK. We’re much
more hospitable — did you hear
that free Anti-Flag vinyls are be-
ing handed out on the corner of
Fifth and Forbes avenues?

We wantyoulto come and pro-
test. It’s your First Amendment
right. However, just ‘because it’s
free speech doesn’t mean it’s
easy.

Tuesdays with Molly

Wilson is relevant? Youlie!  

Policies, not histrionics, should take priority

Molly Green .
Columnist

 

It turns out that whatmost people
remember about President Barack
Obama’s Wednesday night address
to a joint session of Congress
wasn’t his speech itself, but the
exclamation of “You lie!” by Rep.
Joe Wilson,’ R-S.C. ',
Indeed it’s the only thing that
newspapers, political blogs, televi-
sion networks and even Congress
seems to want to talk about — so

I much so that there has been less

discussion about the content of
Obama’s health care address than
that of Wilson’s comment, or his
apology, or Rush Limbaugh’s dis-

6 approval of saidapology, or Speak-

er of the House Nancy Pelosi’s

adamant assertions that he must

apologize again.

In some ways, the media and
public reaction to the comment is
justiﬁed. Certainly, Wilson’s com-
ment was out of line.

Even Obama’s old nemesis Sen.
John McCain, who looks more like
an aged Bilbo Baggins than ever,

thought the comment was disre-
spectful and out of line.
“There is no place for it in

that setting, or any other, and he ..

should apologize for it immedi-
ately,” McCain told CNN.
And in conﬂuence with what

. I’m sure was an intense pressure

from the Republican Party, Wilson
did what any politician conscious
of his public image should do: He
apologized. .

Problems with cloud  
computing extensive

While it seems reasonable, cloud computing far from perfect T

Donald Campbell
Columnist

Cloud computing appears to be the next wave
of computer technology to sweep the corpo-

“rateworlgl. ' ~ . v

This is rather startlingbecause cloud com-
puting represents a complete 180 on the com-
puting paradigms that have, until recently,
dominated corporate IT spending.

Until now, corporations have bought’

and maintained their own server islands,
complete with individually licensed_software

‘ for writing documents and creating spread-

sheets, e-mails, data storage and software
development.

Cloud computing appears to offer a bet-
ter solution — have a larger company like
Google, Amazon or Microsoft provide the
same software solutions as an Internet ser-

I,

Recently, Google’s Gmail service denied
access to millions of customers for a period
of time. Although Gmail is a free service, not
a paid cloud computing service, the outage
made companies skeptical toward laying all
of their critical IT infrastructure in the hands

. of a. shadowy, external cloud.

L ComputerWorld magazine recently pub-
lished a report online describing the concerns
Google received for its recent outages.

Google maintains that its cloud style of on-
linee-mail offerings for corporations is more
reliable than the e—mail services a company
could easily set up with its own servers, but
companies now take Google’s assurances with

an ever-burgeoning grain of salt.

As an apparent reinforcement of these
reservations, the CIO report said cloud com-
puting companies cannot provide services as
efficiently as companies could maintain ser-
vices on-site because of the overhead involved

All is not quite right in the world of cloud
computing, however.

vice for a fee.

- It seems reasonable. After all, it costs
money and requires a signiﬁcant amount
of manpower for a company to successfully
maintain a respectable amount of server ca-
pacity. V ' . .

All is not quite right in the world of cloud
computing, however. _ i

As the implementation of cloud comput-
ing and its threats to dominate become more
apparent, companies are beginning to«dis-
-trust the move toward the cloud. '

A recent report published on the online
information technology journal CIO noted
that the switch to cloud computing might
not be as advantageous as companies once
thought.

First off, the removal of complete control
over IT infrastructure can be somewhat wor-
risome for companies.

The argument is that this removal will
make things cheaperfor the company because

' the company need not deal with the costly and

mundane tasks of server ownership, includ-
ing repairs, power and cooling — might be

. overstated.

- The study found that switching from a test
company’s own server farm to a cloud run by
Amazon would increase operating costs by
144 percent. A

The removal of co ntrol over a server farm
might also cause disconcerting reliability
concerns.

' in providing cloud services to clients,

But what alternatives are there to cloud
computing?

Computing for large corporations might
not be able to stagnate, because the cost
of running individual machines will surely
rise. — .

As the complexity of required software
also increases, it is reasonable to think that
the overhead required to maintain large cor-
porations using multiple software packages
would also increase.

Companies might ﬁnd solace in backing

away from cloud computing and returning to ‘

previous trends in virtualization.
If one server device could .easily run mul-

tiple operating systems and handle multiple ’

infrastructure applications, further optimiza-
tion might not be required.

Furtherconcerns about cloud computing

could be raised over security issues.

Companies with extremely sensitive infor-
mation can compartmentalize information to
a certain extent by disconnecting certain ma-
chines from networks in the outside world.

The cloud inherently implies storage,
transfer and manipulation of business data
in the outside world.

As cloud computing looms greater in the
computing horizon, companies mightbecome
increasingly skeptical of the new technology
for security and safety reasons.

Linebacker Adam Gunn

jay-Huerbin
Sports Editor

With an impressive performance in _

Buffalo, Pitt linebacker Adam Gunn
was named the Big East defensive

— player of the week.

During the Panthers’ 54-27 win
against the Bulls, Gunn tallied 11
tackles and three sacks. V

Gunn was a presence throughout

‘the game for the defense, and his

three sacks resulted in pushing the
Bulls back for 25 yards.

Late in the fourth quarter, Gunn _

came up with a huge sack as Buffalo
closed in from the Panthers’ 14-yard
line. The sack, with Pitt holding a 13-
point lead, pushed the Bulls back to
the 20-yard line, where the Panthers
eventually took over on downs.-

In two games, Gunn has recorded
19 tackles, ﬁve sacks and 5.5 tackles
for loss —- leading the team in all cat-
egories. He also sits tied for second
in the nation with 2.50 sacks per
game and fourth with 2.75 tackles
for a loss per game.

Gunn is playing in his ﬁrst games
since a season-ending neck injury in
the Panthers’ ﬁrst game of the sea-
son against Bowling Green. Gunn

- applied for and was granted a sixth 5

year of eligibility.
Following his undergraduate
studies in communication and

rhetoric in 2008, he enrolled in the-

Graduate School of Public and‘Inter-
national Affairs. Gurm said he plans
to graduate after the fall semester.

. His performance this year is
good news for the Panthers after
the departure of one of the best con-
ference and national linebackers last
season, Scott McKillop.

Last year’s starter, Eric Barnes, has graduated, but

Ben Duignan
Staﬁ” Writer

In 2008, the P_itt men’s soccer team
established" one of the best goalie
tandems in the Big East. '

The one-two punch of Eric-

Barnes andjordan Marks paced the
team to six shutouts while ranking
ﬁrst in the Big East in total saves’
and saves per game.

The duo ranks among the great
goalkeepers in Pitt soccer history.
Marks ranks in the top 10 in all

' four of Pitt’s all-time goalkeeping

records, while Barnes just missed

making the top 10 in several cat- -

egories.
This season brings a new chal-
lenge for the Panthers.

With the departure of Barnes

and. Marks, the biggest question
mark heading into the 2009 cam-
paign is at goalkeeper.

Redshirt junior Zach Matthews
and freshman Keegan Gunderson
are the two Panther goalies hoping

to replace Marks and Barnes.

Matthews had yet to see game
action before this season, but he
had the experience of learning from
Marks and Barnes. He started the
ﬁrst three games for Pitt (1-4) this
season, compiling a 1.93 goals
against average and tallying 14

a he ’s now a coach and ready to help his former team

saves. .
But this year, Matthews will
continue the learning process from
one of his mentors of the past four
seasons.

Barnes is sticking around this
season as a graduate assistant and
goalkeeping coach. He will assist in
the development of the two young
goalies.

Barnes,‘a third-year law student
and a recipient of several coaching
licenses, is relishing the opportu-
nity to stay involved with the team
as a coach. ,

“I’m really excited to work with
these guys,” Barnes said. “They’re
both solid players. I’m just trying to
helpthem with their conﬁdenceand
some other little adjustments.”

Despite the lack of game ex-
perience between Matthews and
Gunderson, Pitt head coach Joe
Luxbacher said he’s also enthusi-
astic about the potential of his new
goalkeepers. -

“Zach has been with us for a few

years now and had a solid spring,” ~ A5

Luxbacher said. “Keegan has expe-
rience playing at the highest levels
of high school soccer. So between
the two, I am conﬁdent we will be
solid in goal.” A

The Panthers didri’t have an offi-
cial goalkeeping coach in 2008, but
Matthews said he’s looking forward

Usain Bolt: the fnextNFL
receiver, boxer and golfer

The ’Gorian Rants

Greg Trietley
Staff Writer

‘Between Usain Bolt’s ability to outrun traffic
and the ongoing controversy with Caster
Semenya, track and ﬁeld is starting to steal
time away from my knitting passion.

Bolt, the always smiling 23-year-old, is a
freak of the sprinting world.

C At 6 feet 4 inches tall, he looms over other
runners. Track aﬁcionados re-evaluated the
ideal sprinter body type because of this ab-
normally tall, abnormally fast Jamaican.

His world record times at the 2009 World‘

Championships in Berlin — 9.58 seconds

and 19.19 seconds in the 100- and 200-meter ,

dashes, respectively — are so low that sci-

‘ entists are re-examining studies about the

limits of human speed.
_ According to Wired Science, Bolt’s times
throw off the curve of natural human pro-
gression. , ‘ g
‘ Needless to say, a discussion about a
. Jamaican sprinter breaking records in
Germany seamlessly segues into American

C football. '

* After the Beijing Olympics, several media
outlets began thinking of the sprinter as Bolt,
National FootballLeague wide receiver. V

His height and speed are so ideal for the
position that his name keeps popping up,

even though nobody knows if he can catch a

the ball. A
_ “Bolt, run really fast downﬁeld,” the
. quarterback would say.
“Yah, mahn.”
Could any cornerback keep up?
Sprinters have attempted the leap from
the track to the gridiron. Former 100-mie-
ter world-record holder Justin Gatlin tried
out with several teams between 2006 and
2008. -

More successfully, the Dallas Cowboys
drafted Olympic sprinter Bob Hayes in 1964.
Opponents had to invent bump—and—run
coverage and zone defense to try to stop
“Bullet Bob.” '

The. chances of Bolt coming to the United 1

States, though, are slim.

He turned down college track scholar-
ships here six years ago, and he has «shown
no intention of playing football.

5 He might, though, make the switch to
long jumping. '

Bolt said he wants to try the event at the '

2012 Olympics in London. Current world-
record holder Mike Powell said he’d help
train him, believing Bolt could jump nine
meters under his guidance.

Nine meters is-almost 30 feet. Bolt could
jump Forbes Avenue. '

After long jumping his way to gold in
three years, Bolt allegedly will try his hand at
javelin and pingpong, drop a rap album and
star in the sequel to Cool Runnings. ‘

But Bolt isn’t the only track star in the
news. 9

A media tsunami has also made landfall
at the doorstep of Caster Semenya, who won
the women’s 800—meter at the ‘world cham-
pionships. But reports later abounded that
she wasn’t a she. ' . '

Test results, according to Britain’s The
Guardian, determined that the 18-year-old
- Semenya’s high testosterone levels stem
from internal male organs. '
In a word, she is a hermaphrodite. Her
future in women’s track is in question.

Semenya entered counseling to cope with -

the gender test revelation.

The International Olympic Committee
stopped across—the—board gender testing in
1999 to avoid situations like Semenya’s.

A woman in some ways, but with the tes-
tosterone levels and will to restore a classic

In first season as a starter, Matthews ready for challenge

to the beneﬁts of working with Barnes.

“One-on-one training on a daily basis
is deﬁnitely going to help us,” Matthews
said.

Luxbacher agreed.

“Having a coach like Eric makes me feel
comfortable that our goalies will get the nec-
essary experience and training time at every
practice,” Luxbacher said. ' ‘

Barnes and Matthews have already devel- ,
oped a relationship as teammates, but Mat-

thews said he .believes Barnes’ new role as a

car of a man, where does she ﬁt in?
At the moment, it sadly might be no-

where.

Butl have the answer: Integrate men’s and
women’s track. Combining the two is the only
way to end Semenya’s controversy.

At this point, why not? The sport is rid-
dled with doping. Compared to Marionjones,
ambiguous genitalia are sunshine.

Plus, women have competed against men
in the past.

Michelle Wie played golf with men when

she was a 15-year-old prodigy. Manon

Rheaume played goal in _two preseason
games for hockey’s_ Tampa Bay Lightning in
the early ’90s.

I’d also mention the ‘15 women who have
raced in NASCAR, but it’s not a sport.

In fact, combine more than track. Inte-

' grate non-contact activities like bowling,

curling and racquetball, to name a few.

For the 2012 Olympics, combine4nen’s
and women’s archery, gymnastics and soc-
cer. ’ I .

Don’t stop there. Integrate everything.

It will end gender disputes thatdestroy
the lives of 18-year-old athletes and decrease
the number of events of which we have to
keep track. '

Integrated tennis! Can an aging Roger
‘Federer keep his focus against the 103-deci-
bel grunt of Maria Sharapova‘?

Integrated fencing! Can the triple-gold

’ American women defeat the great Italian

foil? V
Integrated boxing! Can the Canadian men

shirk the long-standing “no hitting girls” rule 1

before it’s too late? .
I don’t know, but I do know one thing:
Bolt will win.

coach will havea profound impact on him.
“He’s been training me for a while now,”
Matthews said. “But he had a starting job
[last year] to win at the same time. Now that -
he’s a coach, I’m looking forward to continue
learning from him.” .
.Matthews said he knows he can rely on
Barnes because he knows that just a year
ago, Barnes was in his shoes, ﬁghting for a

- starting job on the same team.

Barnes started 10 games last season,
making 51 saves and a,1.37 goals against

average. _

“He knows what we’re going through,”
Matthews said. “He knows about balancing
school, work and soccer. He knows what it
takes to get it done at this level.”

Barnes said he’s looking forward to shar-
ing his experiences with the two young goal-
ies and preparing them to succeed in the Big
East conference.

The goalkeeping coach recalls a trip to
play at Big East powerhouse University of
Connecticut. Morethan 4,000 people were

then No. 2 Huskies in 2007.

“There are going to be 5,000 fans scream-
ing at you, trying to throw off your game,”
Barnes said. “The atmosphere is awesome,
but it’s something you have to prepare for.”

Pitt lost the game 4-0, but Barnes made?
ﬁve saves as the Huskies put up 17 shots.

Matthews, Gunderson and the rest of the
Panthers will make that same trip to Con-
necticut on Oct. 17, and Barnes will be, there
