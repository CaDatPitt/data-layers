Centrex Adoption Due in '73 

by LOIS ELDER

Following consultation with Uni-
versity residence hall leaders, the
University has made arrange-
ments with Bell Telephone to in-
stall the Centrex telephone sys-
tem in the residence halls, en-
abling each dorm room to have a
private phone line.

According to Dr. William Nel-

. son, Director of Purchasing, the

University and Bell have agreed

_ to Centrex for September, 1973.

John Vrana, Director of Univer-
sity Housing, said, “Installation
is just a matter of the telephone
company placing a phone line in
all the rooms in the quadrangle
dormitories and the Medical Cen-

iﬁter Nurses Residence (MCNR) :'

P

-. stated... » ;' ‘

“We always close the .quad-
rangle in the summer, so that
would be an ideal time to prepare
for Centrex there.—- No students
would be disturbed.

"The Towers rooms "already
have these lines and students liv-
ing there have had the option of
paying for a private line." 9

Elaine Krafsig, president of the‘
Women’s Housing Board (WHB),
sent a memo to Vrana on Sept. 25
listing various policies the WHB
would like to see included in Cen-
trex.

One factor was a pro-rated cost
for dorm residents. This will
the $30 phone cost per room be
divided equally among the num-
ber of students living in that
room. The single room student
will pay $30, but double room stu-
dents will each pay $15, and triple
room students will each pay $10.

Another policy was that a resi-
dent student directory be‘publish-
ed for all dorm students:

Vrana said all the policies list-
ed in the memo have been agreed
to, and students can choose

Dorm Project’ Seeks OK

The Hillside Dorm Project will
need more publicity if it is to have
any chance of approval, accord-
ing to Joe Dutton, Vice-Chancel-

 ..l0.I.‘.Of._Qperations.
;__,_ The project, whi‘ch"".had been
"discussed last year, “died” when

it was not approved in time to re-
ceive an appropriation from the
Federal Government. '

DUFTON: ‘Hi we on (obtain these

dorms, the real losers will be the

students.”

The main tie-up in the project

was a meeting between Universi-

ty officials and Oakland Develop-
ment, Inc. (ODI), representing
the residents of the Oakland area.

Dave Bluey, a member of Stu-
dent Government who attended

Qxtie meeting,‘said that its main fo-

cus centered around thelocation‘
of the dorms.

“The people who live in the area
seem to thinkthat if the dorms
are built on the hillside, the stu-
dents living in them will hang
around their neighborhoods and
cause disturbances,” he explain-
ed. "But I don’t think this will
happen. I think the students would
remain on the lowercampus.

Both Dutton and Bluey empha-
sized that, at’ present, there are
no definite, plans concerning the
structure of the dorms. V

"All our plans are currentlyof
.a temporary ,nature;'.';

However,‘ Dutton and Bluey
both agree that something con-
crete must beaccomplished in
the near future if the project is
to have a chance for ratification

A this year.

Dutton hopes to take a step in
this direction by holding another
meeting with ODI attended by
members of the press. He hopes
the publicity will inform the pub-
lie of the urgency of the problem.

Dutton said, “If we don’t ob-
tain these dorms, the real losers
are going to be the students.”

Bluey added, “If the Universi-
ty hopes to help those students
who have landlord problems or
are living in poor housing facil-
ities, it is going to have to provide
some sort of alternative for them.
If the overall quality of housing on
campus is to improve, the Univer-
sity must provide some competi-
tion.” p \

meeting would be set a later time.

Nelson said Pitt is a follower in
installing Centrex because many
other universitites have had it for
several years. Arkansas Univer-
sity had it installed in 1967, and
Duquesne and Harvard began us-

CASC to Consider Revision in

Distribution pot‘ Studies Requirements-

by KARL BALDYS

At Mondays meeting of the Col-
lege of Arts and Sciences Council
Ron Eskin, chairman of the Stu-
dent Cabinet of the College of Arts
and Sciences, proposed a revision
in the distribution of studies re-
quirement that would allow stu-
dents to concentrate their nine
distribution credits in one depart-
ment. He also proposed a “Bank-
ruptcy Plan” that would allow
students to drop all grades of D
or F from one regular term’s
work if that work was affected by

some serious personal problems.

At the moment, the distribution
of studies requirement is satis-
fied when nine credits in the hu-
manities, the social sciences,
and the natural sciences are com-
pleted, with the nine credits in
each area spread over three de-
partments. ’

Eskin’s proposal would allow
a student to devote the nine cred-
its in any given area to one de-
partment within the area.

He added, “This does not mean
that the student is forced to take
all nine credits in one department.
He canymake any combination he
wants. However, this provides an
option that didn’t exist before."

It is Eskin’s contention that the
present system of distribution re-

Studies  

Program Started at Pitt

by JoHN CAPITMAN

As a result of a favorable coop-
eration between the University
and the United Jewish Federation
of Pittsburgh, there will be a new
program in Jewish Studies at
Pitt, directed by Dr. Bernard
Goldstein, beginning in January.

Goldstein. who is currently at
Yale University, received his BA
and MA from Columbia and his
Ph.D. from Brown‘ University.
As a charter member of the Asso-
ciation of Jewish Studies, he has
been instrumental in developing
the history of Medieval science in
the Near East and Southern
France.

Next term, Dr. Goldstein will

be the first full time faculty mem-
ber in Jewish-Studies and will of-

- fer, under the aegis of the Depart-

ment of,History and Philosophy
of Science, a course on Israel and
the: Biblical _Age,- and another on

‘ Jewish Culture in Megdievallsipain , ,

   

and Provence, as well as coordi-
nation other courses on Judaism.

Dr. Jerome L. Rosenberg, Dean
of the Faculty of Arts and Sci-
ences. explained that the new
courses, Jewish Studies 101 and
110, like past courses in Hebrew
a-nd Modern Israeli History.
“have been approved by the CAS
Council."

Due to what Rosenberg calls "a
great partnership,” the United
Jewish Federation of Pittsburgh
is funding the new program so
"that it will not be competitive
with other programs for Univer-
sity budgetary resources."

_"Specific academic consultive
leadership” will be provided by
Dr. Goldstein in selecting the
materials for a library collection

generous gift ’from Mrs‘. Phillip_
‘Hoffman, inorder to support the

quirements  . . does little in the
way of broadening the student
. .  because students are forced
to skim over courses they are not
interested in. He said, “The stu-
dent could far more benefit from
deeper courses in one department
rather than superficially touch-
ing a number of departments.”

Eskin described the CASC’s re-
action as “cool,” but thatdoes not
necessarily mean the proposal
won’t be accepted._. The CASC,
composed of Dr. Jerome Schnee-
wind, Dean of the College of Arts
and Sciences, ‘five faculty mem-
bers, and four students, will con-
sider and discuss the issue, and
then a vote will be taken by the
faculty and student board mem-
bers.

Eskin’s “Bankruptcy Proposal"
is based on an ongoing policy at
the University of. Indiana. Under

main phone number and asking
the operator-to connect you.

Q‘. The operators will be phased
 out and if they so desire will be
5 ‘placed in other jobs at the Univer-
sity.

There will be someone at the
Centrex console, however, once
Centrex is installed, to connect
calls for people who don’t know
a certain Centrex number of
someone at the University.

Nelson explained that under
Centrex, both for administrative
‘offices and dormitories, there will
i be no need for a switchboard.

, en digit number, although the first
three digits will be the same, for
-each phone.

 

 

Any equipment repairs previous-
ly had to be done at the Universi-
ty. However, with Centrex, re-
pairs will be done at Bell Tele-
phone’s Pittsburgh office.

Vrana’said that with Centrex
. in the dorms, “Students can call
. anywhere in the Pittsburgh met-
~ ropolitani area with unlimited
‘ message units.

“However, if a student wants
whisphone to be used for long dis-
tance or toll calls, he will have to

will personally be billed, just as
home phones are billed for calls
out of the metropolitan area.

presently, for students to get a
private line, but all the other
dorm residents couldn’t. MCNR
has the worst service with two
floor phones for 60 students. It’s
virtually impossible to reach peo-
ple in the Towers and MCNR who
rely on floor phones. This is a ser-
ious thing at a time when com-
munication is necessary.

Vrana cited another advantage
of private phones. “The Universi-
ty of Maryland has a system in
which a student can call a certain
number and be plugged into a tape
recording that plays, for example.
a French lesson. If a student is in
his room at night and wants to

brush up on word pronunciation’. ,

he can call that number and lis-
ten to the tape. There are many
educational spinoff systems avail-
able with private phone lines."

Cantwell Announces Improvements

Pitt Student Health Service “A—1"

“Quite an extensive health service” is how R.
N. Beverly Cantwell describes Pitt’s Student Health
Center. Cantwell, who has served as nursing super-
visor at the Health Center since April, 1971, feels
that the service has “gotten much better” during
the time she has been here.

During an interview, she spoke of the recent-

development of special areas within the health
service, such as the birth control program, a first
aid clinic for RA’s, and a weight control program
which is just getting under way.

An addition, which Cantwell expressed regret
over, however, is the institution of service charges
for visits to general practitioners, specialists and
for medicine. But she maintained that “with the
budget cut, we had to do something.”

Of the_ new student insurance program, she
said, “It is the best in the country right now, for
students.”

One of the innovations at the center which she
sees as particularly important is the Nursing Tri-
age System, created in the fall of 1971. The system

B Plagiarism Causes DisciplinaryAction

provides a3 kind of immediate medical care pro-
gram. Students who do not have appointments with
doctors'but who want to see someone can walk in
and be examined by one of the staff nurses.

The program, which Cantwell says “not too
many schools have,” has met with a “fairly good
reaction” by students.

Having attended several college health serv-
ice conferences in the past year and a half, she re-
lated that “when you get out and look at other pro-
grams, this is A-1.” ‘

 

She attributed some of the student criticism of _

the service to its role as a “mother figure.” Many
students, especially freshman, she explained, are
away from home for the first time and are apt to
relieve anxieties and frustrations on the people at

the Health Center much as they would on mother.

Cantwell, who will leave her position here in
November, described her job as being “somewhat
of a challenge.” Prior to" her employment at Pitt,
she worked in a hospital.

Changes Seen in Academic Revi

by KATHIE SULLIVAN

The Undergraduate Academic Review, a survey pub-
lished bi-annually and available free of charge, is an eval-
uation summary of all courses offered by the University.
The statistics stated in these evaluations come directly
from the students who are given an opportunity each term
to voice their opinion about the course in which they are
enrolled. Response to this evaluation has been minimal
by the departments and many times apathy has stood in
the way of opinion.

Taking a major step towards improvement of this
system is the Philosophy Department. Following a unani-
mous vote, the department has decided that all faculty
will be required to participate in the evaluation. In the
past, the policy stood that the departments encouraged
participation, but, in many cases the response was poor.

Dr. Joseph Camp, Philosophy ofiLogic instructor,

feels that the UAR is a definite asset to the students as
well as the professors. He stated that the Philosophy De-
partment even went so far as to circulate an informal
evaluation of their own Spring and Summer session offer-
ings because they feel this is such a major method of im-
proving course response. He hopes eventually, with in-
creased funding, the UAR will be able to evaluate during
these sessions. -

Rudy Potenzone. editor of the UAR. responded en-
thusiastically to the Philosophy Department’s decision.
"Many departments do not require evaluation, thus. all
suffer. This decision, hopefully, will be followed by many
more like it. This year. we will be allowing teachers to
take the option of printing their evaluation or leaving it
out completely. Naturally, it will hurt the students in that
some instructors may choose to disregard their statis-
tics, but it will help the new teachers whose evaluation

F riday, September 29, 1972—THE PITT NEWS—Page 3

ew System

could subject them to a course revision.”

Potenzone also said that the teachers were playing a
"game of credibility,” that is, the decision to submit or
omit their evaluation strengthens the effect of the survey.

Working along with the UAR staff is Dr. Grace Lasa-
_vick, coordinator of the Center for Improvement of Teach-
ing. “In order to improve teaching,” Lasavick says, “we
must have feedback from the students. The UAR is trying
to establish trust with the faculty by giving them the de-
cision to print their evaluation. This way the students will
find more teachers responding and the UAR can further
their goals in hopes of a ‘mandatory evaluation. A

The Undergraduate Academic Review will be-avail-
able to all students and faculty by October 11, with course
evaluations from Winter Term, 1972. Evaluation of Fall
Term courses will take place on Nov. 8. ’

Full Civil Rights Sought

  Gay Students Organize  

by RALPH DEAN /

A meeting which had been bill-
ed simply as a “get-together“ of
"Gay" (homosexual) students
here at Pitt was attended by over

"30 persons Wednesday night in a

Schenley Hall dining room. The
emphasis was on informality, and
those in attendance varied great-
ly in their degree of inhibition.
One of the more candid “gays,”
Bob Hughes, introduced himself
as having taken action ‘towards
establishing University-recog-
nized and sponsored organization,
presently titled Gay Students at
Pitt. Hughes stated that he had
spoken with Dean of Student Af-
fairs Moye and other University
officials and had filed the re-
quired forms and a tentative con-
stitution. The constitution listed
the organization’s purpose as both
social and politi‘cal—-to inform the

-Pitt community about homosex-

uality and to help the homosexual
citizen "obtain full civil rights,
while functioning as a means for
organizing “gay” activities on
campus. Membership was stated
as being open to all members of
the Pitt community.

Hughes emphasized that he did
not wish to take charge of the or-
ganization, but that he simply saw
a need for a group here at Pitt

‘ similar to those on “300 to 400”

campuses nationwide. When ask-
ed what the administration’s re-
action was, he said that the peo-
ple he had talked to hadgseemed
quite receptive, and that he ex-
pected no trouble of the sort which
occured at Penn State, where the
Board of Trustees vetoed an ap-
plication for recognition from a
similar group, apparently fearing
action by the State Legislature.

An open discussion followed the
reading of the proposed constitu-
tion and some major questions
were raised. Some of those pre-
sent were interested in the possi-
bilities of having distinct men’s
and women’s groups within the
organization. The part that "bi-
sexuals” should play in the or-
ganization was also questioned.

Discussion of whether or not to

open meetings to the public and
press was heated, with some of
the more inhibited “gays” favor-
ing the immediate expulsion of
this reporter and a reporter from
The Pittsburgh Press who was
also in attendance. All of these
topics were left open for discus-
sion at future meetings, which are
now scheduled for 8 p.m. every
Wednesday in 524 SU.

Future programs and projects
for the organization which were
suggested included dances, “gay-
ins,” orientation activities, and

'-the formation of a “gay” library.

Interest was expressed in the pos-
sibilities for a “Gay Studies Pro-
gram" or Seminar in the more
distant future.

Government Spends
Millions Hiding Infoi
Moorhead Says

Representative Moorhead
(Democrat. 14th District) of
Pittsburgh recently released fig-
ures which indicate that the U.S.
government spends twice as much!-
money hiding information than
handing it out. A total of $126.3
million is spent for classification
while only $64 million is spent for
information programs.

Of course, the congressman’s
figures may exclude a lot of se-
cret funding of secrecy programs. .

of a big name performer, the
Homecoming Committee is in the
process of contracting three per-
formers for the two and one-half
hour Homecoming concert Nov. 3
at the Syria Mosque.

The ‘concert will be one of the
main events of a week of Home-

Wednesday, Nov. 1, and lasting
till Sunday.

The theme, “With Pride and
Tradition” is part of the Home-
coming Committees’ plan to en-
courage alumni to return to their
alma mater for the week of activ-
ities. According to Homecoming
Chairman Sue Powell, this year’s
activities will be geared to the
alumni as well as -to the Pitt stu-
dent.

This year because of the empha-
sis on tradition a Homecoming

queen will be selected. Organiza-.
.tions will nominate candidates

who -will be voted on by a panel of
judges and the student body.

_Both group_s will have equal
representation.
ing queen will be announced on
Wednesday at the leadership din-
ner and from then on will act as
hostess for all the Homecoming
events.

The events for the week will in- A

clude a keg rolling contest and pa-
rade. Each campus organization

may enter either a float or-a ban- _

ner in the parade and compete for
cash prizes. Each organization

may also enter a team of three in .

the keg rolling contest. Prelimin-
aries will be held following the

‘parade and finals will be before

the football game.

One of the newer additions to
the activities is a Blue and Gold
Merit Award of $250, to be pre-
sented to a Pitt student at the
pre-game activities.

always assured right up to the

I went on.- "It’s McGovern here,

Horace was practically beam-

a campaign aimed at the hearts
of American voters, but not es-

Bombs Away

sure that all targets in a particular campaign are

hit. Blasting away at “bandits” would be nose gun-
ner Larry O’Brien.
The B-24 would have no navigator, because pilot

McGovern decides himself how to get lost. As for
the belly turret, the roof turret, and the tail turret-

the three would be manned by unpaid volunteers.

Richard Nixon, to the effect that
he wished loopholes not to be
closed but made larger. So, not
wishing to have Mr. Nixon end my
article, I include in this letter the
final two paragraphs, which real-
ly speak to the question of. what
George McGovern believes about
tax reform. What follows are the
final two paragraphs:

“George McGovern realizes
that inequality has been written
into our tax laws, and ‘that in
many different ways, the law
says: ‘All Americans are equal,
but rich are more equal than
others.’ He would allow for risks
in investment, but not at the ex-
pense of the ordinary taxpayer.
McGovern himself has stated pre-
cisely what would be the guiding
principle for a reform of our tax
laws: ‘Money made by money

And maybe one episode could guest—star Tom Eagle-
ton as a bomb, being dropped.

Just picture a scene of the "Dakota Queen"
nearing primary target. McGovern is in the cock-
pit giving control of the “24” to the bombadier.

“Okay, Gary, she’s all yours. And remember,
lay off the hospitals!”

“Awww, okay, Chief.”

The camera shows Hart doing his dirties down
below eight 1000—pounders). Then the camera looks
through the bombsight, the cross-hairs centered on
the locks of a dam.

“Bombs away!” cries Hart, pressing the but-
ton. “Take that, you water-gates!” Calming down,
the bombardier speaks to McGovern. “I’m giving
her back to you, Chief!” ‘

Back in the cockpit McGovern takes hold of the
wheel again. “Pilot to crew. Mission accomplished.
Watch out, America, we’re coming home. Take
over, Teddy, sir.” McGovern leans back in his seat
as Ted turns the plane 180 degrees to the left.

Man, I’d have to watch this TV program.

should be taxed at the same rate
as money made by men.’,What all
this means is a real tightening of
our tax laws: higher rates on cap-
ital gains; reduction to reason-
able levels of depreciation allow-
ances; making the depletion al-
lowance cover only ‘actual costs’)
reduction of the favoritism on tax-
es for investments.

“Thus the analysis of why ‘the
rich get richer’ is simple: the
law is in their favor. George Mc-
Govern seeks to end this favored
treatment. But his plan for a more
equitable tax system will not
bring Utopia. However. if trans-
lated into policy, it will help a ma-
jority of Americans lead a more
humane life. And, in‘the end-. that
is all politics can do."

~-oh.”

“You see, McGovern complains
about the war dragging on, an is-
sue that has frustrated and con-
fused Americans for years. Now
what does Dick talk about? The
ridiculous number of reruns that
network television dumps on the
witless public.”

“That’s pretty smart," I agreed.
"Americans would rather hear
about something closer to. home
than the war. For example, Ar-
chie Bunker."

“Whom, by the way, Nixon con-
siders—-and I quote—‘a good. de-
cent man.’ A brilliant statement
from a man to whom I would nev-
er before have granted so much
” Horace appeared rev-
erent for a moment. “But look at
another example. While McGov-
ern deplores the amount of gov-
ernment spending on defense.
Nixon moans about the loss to
New,England by Atlanta's foot-
ball team last weekend.”

“Clever man. Hitting those
Monday morning quarterbacks
right in the old breadbasket.”

"That’s it exactly. While the
Democrats spend all their time
wrestling with the problems of
taxes, the war, ecology, and equal
rights, Nixon becomes the balm
of the people, the mainstay of the
culture, the aspirin one swallows
to shake off the persistent head-
ache of discontent. It’s a matter

_of degree. McGovern comes ou_t

   

for lower taxesfor the poor, less
defense spending. an end to the
war, etc.; Nixon favors weekend
football; fewer re—runs, hot dogs

which Richard Nixon exhibits. the
Horatio Alger streak in him with
which every red-blooded Ameri-
can boy can identify. Red-blooded

ber, soon grow up to be red-blood-

I ‘shook my head in astonish-
ment and admiration. “Horace,

you are incredible. You know, the

administration would pay a lot for
that kind of insight and aware-
ness.” '

“I know," Horace said. taking
out a wad of bills. "They already
have. Five, 10, 15, 20.”

“The Grand Scale

by JOHN METCALFE

Lately almost everything worth mentioning seems to be measured
in billions, at least in this country. One reason is that Americans are
more likely to havea billion of any given object than almost anyone I
can name. Another better reason is that the American billion is a sham.

Our billion is the result of a mistaken impression on the grand
scale. In the rest of the world, it is necessary to have a million millions
of a given thing before you can claim title to a billion of them. We have
applied a discount. For us, it is quite enough to accumulate a thousand
millions of whatever we are discussing. One is then a billionaire in that
commodity.

Aside from this quibble, billions of almost everything can be found
all around us. Reports of governmental spending likely first populariz-
ed the term, though some enterprising manufacturer of pins or staples
may have been the first to use it in advertising. Whatever, we are stuck
with it.

Billions abound. We spend 80 billion dollars every year just to de-
fend ourselves. Billions of gallons of gasoline are sold annually to get
us where we are today. Once the Gross National Product was measured
in billions of dollars. Now it is so gross_ it is given in trillions; so far
just one trillion, followed by a decimal, but the trend is clear.

The notion is abstract in the extreme. A billion of anything cannot _
be easily visualized. Hardly any of us still cringe when Congress spends "

yet another billion of the dollars it extracts from us as taxes (or spends
in anticipation of extracting them in an odd-numbered year).

We are a multitude, and we are the most prosperous multitude
ever to grace the globe, as we are frequently reminded by that same
Congress that spends our real and expected billions. We can afford it,
we suppose.

There we are mistaken. There are only 200 million of us, a respect-
able figure in the ordinary sense, but hardly worth mentioning on days
when billions are bandied about.

The arithmetic of it is invincible. Two hundred million is neatly
and precisely one—fifth of a billion. Every time a billion of anything
American is mentioned, each of us can claim five of whatever_it is.
"Each of us” includes infants scarcely past the shock of conception
and a number of folks who have abandoned the productive life in favor
of retirement. ' -

So it follows—if a given war costs $24 billion a year to keep going
with indifferent success, then each of us, from embryo to Senior Citi-
zens, pays $120 per year for this entertainment. If a certain corpora-
tion requires a quarter of billion dollars to get out of this year’s trou-
bles, each of us ponies up a $1.25. Isn’t this fun?

The ‘Congress is attempting to keep federal expenditures in the
neighborhood of $250 and $270 billion a year in the near future. By
dividing by the magic number five, we see that they are debating wheth-

‘er to spend 12 hundred and 50 or 13 hundred and 50 dollars per year

on behalf of each of us.

That earlier figure on defense works out to about $400 per year to
defend each of us. I begin to suspect we must have offended someone.
to need that much defense. ~

Enough of this. Consider the frivolous . . . billions are spent every
year in advertising, which “informs” us as to which of otherwise in-
distinguishable products we should purchase. And there is one use of
the_magic word, one place where “billion” is used so loosely it gives
me great offence. ‘

l A certain nationwide chain of hamburger outlets claims it has
sold, by various reports, six billion, nine billion, or "many” billions,
of small hamburgers. This advertising casts a slur upon my character
as\an.American and a consumer. ’

I believe in the hamburger. I have visited the city for which it is
named, and even married a native of the place. I, personally. grill a su-
perior hamburger. But, studying this advertising in light of my curious
View of billions, I find a sinister implication.

By my own law of billions, it would appear that I have personally
consumed 30, or 45, or five times “many” of these horrible concoc-
tions. I have not. ' '

Once, I ate a small fraction of one, as an experiment. I have never
been tempted into repeating the experiment. V

Back to business. Next time you hear tell of a billion of anything

American, five of them are yours. Pounds of bombs, for instance. A bil- .

lion pounds is only half a million tons, and a brisk weekend in the re-
moter parts of Asia can easily account for that. ‘

‘A.-

Wednesday, a student came
to the Legal Awareness Commit-
tee office with a copy of an ad
from Pittsburgh iii’ a Nutshell
Magazine. The ad promised stu-
dents “free french fries and a
soft drink with your order of a
hamburger” in the Hunt Room of
Schenley Hall. The student had
just come from the Hunt Room
where he had been told that he
was one of over 50 students who
had presented the ad, but that he
wouldn’t receive his free french .
fries and drink because the ad
was not valid.

Immediately afterward, I visit-
ed the Hunt Room and ordered a
hamburger, french fries and a
small drink. I presented a copy
of Nutshell to the cashier. She
told me the ad was “no good.”
I asked her if we were in the‘
Hunt Room and if she were em-
ployed by Szabo Food Service.
She said that she worked for
Szabo F"oods but could not honor
the ad. Then I asked her for her .
name. She refused to give it to
me.

At this point she charged me
$1.00 for my hamburger, french
fries and small drink. The price

""i§eemed a little high, but I paid

her and asked for a receipt. She

told me that she could not give

me a receipt. I then asked her
where I could redeem the ad.
She ‘said that she did not know
where the ad could be redeemed,
but she guided me to a ‘man she
identified to one of the managers.
I showed him my ad. He told
methat the ad was “not valid.” I
asked him whether Szabo Food
Service placed the ad. He said
that the ad was a mistake and
would not be honored, but that I
should see Mr. Kie, the manager

of Szabo Food_ Service at Pitt. Mr. I
Kie was not in his office. Dur-
ing all this time, my lunch was
getting cold.

At this point I asked the man
who took me to Mr. Kie’s office
what his name was. He didn’t
answer. I asked again, and he
asked me what difference it
made. Before I could answer,
we were back in the Hunt Room.
The manager went up to the
cashier whom he called Betty.
He asked her to refund my $1.00.
After signing a receipt, I took
my $1.00, my hamburger, my
french fries, and my small drink
and left. '

After lunch, I called the pub-
lishers of Nutshell, a corporation
called Approach 13-30 in Knox-
ville Tennessee. The switchboard
operator connected me with Mr.
Garrett Pierce. Pierce informed
me that the ad in question was
purchased for Szabo Foods by a
Mr. Robertson from Lyons, Ill.
Pierce also informed me that
Szabo Foods had paid for the ad.

A call to Szabo Food Service

in Lyons, Ill, established that"

Robertson was the Vice-Presi-
dent in charge of marketing. Ro-
bertson, however, was out of the
office for the day. The rest of the
marketing division was not avail-
able due to meetings and would
not be available the next day. I
left my name and asked to have
my call returned.

Since Nutshell is distributed by
the Office of Student Affairs, I
theri called Dean Moye. Since he
wasn’t in, I asked to speak to
Gary Huston who was also out.

tNext I asked for Al Bowen, the

Coordinator of the Campus Judi-
cial System. Bowen informed me
that he would check into the situ-

atign.

Bill Markus, the Director of
student Activities, called me
shortly after I spoke to Bowen.
Markus pointed out that Stu-
dent Activities actually handles
the distribution of Nutshell at
Pitt. Markus then expressed his
hypotheses as to how the problem
arose. After I assured him that I
did not plan to sue the Food
Service of his office, he hung
up. .
Later Wednesday afternoon, I
called Kie Haghighi, the recent-
ly appointed manager‘ of Szabo
Food Service at Pitt. He explain-
ed that the ad in Nutshell was
actually a rerun of last year’s
ad. When the ad was placed,
Haghighi was not in charge at
Pitt.

Haghighi said that he was sorry
if any mix-up had occurred, but
that Szabo Foods intended to
promote a special offer service
to students in the Hunt, Room
during the first week of October.

In regard to those students who
were hurt by the‘, misunder-
standing, Haghighi said: “If it’s
a few people who are unhappy
about the situation, I’ll be happy
to refund their money.”

While Szabo Foods is anxious
to correct past mistakes, they
will have to go quite a way to
satisfy many of the students com-
plaintsregistered so far.

Only time will show whether
new management at Szabo can
provide satisfactory services for
Pitt students. But in the meantime,
students might be wise to heed
some advise printed in the bogus
ad: “it isn’t such a dynamite
deal” . . . indeed.

Ph.D. degrees have been term-
ed a "glut on the market" in most
fields. Many new Ph.D’s are find-

ing it more difficult to find posi-

tions than individuals with low-

er qualifications, due to the sta-
tus system used by many educa-
tional and industrial bureaucra-
cies.

Even engineers, who were in
demand several years ago, are

facing a tight market and many

must serve apprenticeships.

The bleak economic picture is
certainly no secret, the news
media has publicized it widely

and it is one of the major issues in

the current political campaign.
. Nevertheless,. counselors and
placement officers here at Pitt
report that seniors are still com-

ing to their offices two months

before graduation, to

choose a vocation.

Many of them are ill prepared
to fill any position, according to

trying

the counselors; and some of them _

will probably find themselves
pushing brooms, driving taxis or
working as file clerks despite
their education.

students must face the prospects

Medical and hospital admin-

even if opportunities exist in
their chosen field.

Others do not really under-
stand the duties, frustrations
and pressures’ associated their

A great deal of this informa-

professionals who are successful

No matter what type of educa-
tion you are pursuing, some area
of Business or Communications
is probably related to your inter-
ests. These two vocations offer
good opportunities for qualified,
enthusiastic graduates. Neverthe-
less, competition is keen, and most
individuals entering these fields
start at the bottom and work
their way up. ‘

Most Business and Communica-
tions employers do not hire in-
dividuals with highly specialized
educations to fill their adminis-
trative positions, rather they pre-
fer individuals with a broad, liber-
al background. They are highly

...».--~

concerned with theappearance.
verbal ability and personality of
a job applicant.

Finding a job in these fields is

often a matter of being at. the.

righf place at the right time. And

. as always, its not what you know,

but . . . However-, students with
high motivation should be able
to make the necessary connec-
tions.

Participation in student activi-
ties, publications and summer in-
ternship programs are invaluable
for job seekers.

Communications
Individuals who intend to enter

the field of Communications
should make certain that they can
write clear. concise English. Al-
though newspapers, magazines.
TV and radio stations are current-
ly discouraging journalism ma-
jors (Pitt doesn’t offer one any-
way). they definitely want liter-
ate employees. v

Positions in photojournalism.
broadcasting. sports writing. and
public relations require special
skills which can not be learned.
in classrooms. Experience, imagin-
ation and talent are requisites for
success in these endeavors.

Wednesday’s Business and Com-
munication Career Seinar will
provide students with a chance to
meet with many professionals who

' are well established in “Communi-

cations.

Guests will include Edward

cations. _

Business

Business employers are particu-
larly interested in students with
backgrounds in economics, and
who have served as leaders of
organizations. Individuals may
want to specialize in subjects
related to the business field they
hope to enter. \

The business world touches
nearly all facets of American
life; opportunities appear within
existing corporate structures, and
for the enterprising, there is al-
ways the chance to start out on
your own.

Business areas such as. adver-
tising, air traffc control. banking,
insurance. merchandising. public

 

relations, real estate and stock

brokerage will be represented at

 

the seminars by successful indi-j.‘ 

viduals in each respective field.
Members of the faculty of Pitt’s

Graduate School of Business will -I '

also be on hand for those who
want to do post-graduate work.

If you are seriously consider-

ing a career in business or -com- I

munications, now is the time to
prepare yourself. Wednesday’s-

seminars will offer an excellent 
opportunity to explore opportuni-?

ties in these fields.

 

Scientists discover new know-
ledge through research. Engin-
eers create new technologies and

"new solutions to problems. by

using thisknowledge. Two dec-
ades from now, our world will
have been almost entirely re-
shaped. Engineers,’ working
with the discoveries of scientists,
will be responsible for much of
this reshaping.

Running concurrently with the
"communications ‘ and Business
Day," "on Wednesday October 4,
is “Careers in Engineering,” which,
in a departure from tradition,
will be held in Benedum Hall,
making it more convenient for
engineers to attend.

All of the traditional special-
ties within the field of engineer-

Engineering Careers.

ing such as chemical, civil, elec-
trical, industrial, mechanical and
metallurgical engineering will
be represented as well as some
highly creative interdisciplinary
types of engineering.

« Growing awareness of the ad-
verse effects of technology has
added .a new dimension to en-
gineering. Today’s engineers
have become increasingly aware
of how their work affects their
environment. This concern has
resulted in job opportunities for
engineers in air, pollution control.
transportation, and housing.

Partly because of the current
downtrend in employment of
engineers, a downtread which
most knowledgable sources see
as temporary—and partly as a re-
action against hat many people
see as the inflexibility and lack
of creativity of the traditional
role of the engineer in our so-
ciety, engineering has recently

begun to take on an interdiscip-
linary character. '

Representing these trends at the
Seminars will be engineers in

administration in law. and en-
gineers in medicine.
Opportunities for engineers

are not as glum as portrayed
by the media. A rapidly expand-
ing population, coupled with in-
creasing use of energy, transporta-
tion, communications and mater-
ials, dictates an ever increasing
need for engineers in govern-
ment, industry and education.

Steel is Pittsburgh’s major in-
dustry, but production of elec-
trical equipment, aluminum.
glass, chemicals, oil, coal, gas
and many other products contrib-
ute to the city’s economy.. The
headquarters of some of the coun-
try’s largest corporations are in
Pittsburgh. In addition, more than
50 major industrial research la-
boratories operate with Pitts-

burgh’s metropolitan area.

Representatives from these com-
panies will be on hand at the
seminars to discuss job oppor-
tunities in their particular field

with interested students.

.Other interdisciplinary areas
which can’ involve engineering
are economics, energy resources
and development, public health,
medical administration, environ-
mental health, urban health,

industrial hygiene, and water

pollution control. 2 A

In the last few years career
problems of women became a
focal point of the women’s liber-
ations movement. including the
feminists at Pitt. _

Last year pickets were held in
front of the Cathedral of Learn-
ing demanding equal pay for
women employees at Pitt. This
year a discrimination suit was
filed against the University by
Sharon Johnson of the Biochem-
istry Department charging dis-
crimination in tenure award pro-
cedures.1 ‘

As well as dealing with these
immediate, problems, feminists,
at Pitt began last year to increase _

public awareness of general car-
eer opportunities for women.

The University Counseling
Center assisted in promoting of
these career opportunities. These
combined efforts culminated in a
seminar held last year on career
opportunities for women.

Because of the positive reaction
to last year’s seminar and the
continued interest of many wo-
men in this area. the Counseling
Center has planned a second
seminar on women's career oppor-
tunities.

The seminar will be held on
Thursday, between 1 and 4 p.m.
The program will provide a com-

prehensive view of the new kinds
of options that women now have
in selecting future professions.

explained that “the opportunities

for women in professional ca-
reers are greater than they have
ever been before. This is expeci-
ally true in the fields of medi-
cine. law and university teach-

ya

ing.

Discussing this trend will be
several women doctors and law-
yers invited to participate in the
seminar. The doctors have wide
experience in medical research
pediatric medicine, psychiatry,
and general practice. '

Additionally. Marlene Bug_os
will be -discussing pharmacy
careers. and Dr. Sallie Boggs will
be available to speak with wo-
men interested in medical re-
search.

In the not so distant past the
field of law was practically clos-
ed to women. Now, however.

law schools have opened their
doors to women and the field is
enjoying increased popularity.

A number of women lawyers
will be discussing this trend, as
well as offering advice to pros-
pective women law students.
Pittsburgh lawyers) Rosalind Lit-
man, June Schulberg and Kath-
leen Merry will all be present.
In addition, Judge Marion Finkel-
horn has been invited to parti-
cipate. '

All of these women were par-
ticularly glad to have the oppor-
tunity to meet with university
women interested in law because
of the pressing need to "get wo-
men into the field." .

Women are playing a continu-
ing role of importance at Univer-
sities across the country.

Not only are women teaching
in a wider range of fields. but
may occupy positions for con-
siderable importance in univer-
sity administrations and hier-

“Sunshine of Your Love?’ (of

“Badge” is

here, featuring

-“l‘Angelo Misterioso,” alias Gor-

There are two Delaney and

first is a typical D&B cut—rockin

Even one with the Mad Hatter

Eric and Leon Russell. It’s
nice.
Two versions of “Tell the

Folk Design Abouncls in
Frick Quilt Exhibition .

by DEANHP. SIEGAL

It seems that the new thing to
do is “make it yourself.” This
recent boom in needlework and
arts. and crafts throughout the
country has revealed a most fas-
cinating art form in a collection
of handmade Pennsylvania quilts
of the nineteenth century. The
collection represents only a small
portion of the quilts of Grete
Holst Evans, a woman who has
collected quilts of this state since
1940.

According to Pamela Bardo,‘

director of the University Art
Gallery in the Frick Fine Arts
Building, which ‘houses the ex-
hibition, the quilts were. chosen
for their distinction of tech-
nique, historic association, color,
and design. The quilts were well
chosen, and some fine representa-
tive designs of the nineteenth
century are shown. -

Associate Sports Editor

Both the Pitt Panthers and the
Northwestern Wildcats have been
on a starvation diet so far this
season. Tomorrow both teams
will be looking for their first win
of the ‘72 campaign when they
meet at 1:30 p.m. at Pitt Stadium.

Tomorrow’s contest is the fifth

in a series with the Wildcats. be-
gun in 1949. Each. squad has col-

’ lected two wins and in their last

meeting in 1954 Pitt claimed the
victory by the score of 14-7.

In his eight seasons as the head
football coach at Northwestern,

I-.»”\s Alex Agase has helped to guide his

 

5-.

team to the runner—up position in
the Big Ten for the past two sea-
sons.

But, with the graduation of the
squad that brought the Wildcats
into contention for the Big Ten
title, Agase has beenleft with a
“tremendous rebuilding project.

Before the start of the season,
the Northwestern mentor was
optimistic about the outcome of
his rebuilding program.

. “We’ve got an important intan-

'g1ble going for us now,” related

of '72—last fall’s seniors—devel-
oped. You can call it a ‘winning
attitude! That attitude is a good
foundation for building a new
team."

So far this season, however, the
Northwestern team has not been
able to capitalize on this winning
attitude.

With the '72 season only two
games old, the Wildcats have re-
corded a 0-2 slate. In their season
opener they held the nationally
ranked Michigan squad to only
one touchdown, losing by the score
of 7-0. ‘

The Michigan Wolverines ac-
quired the game winning touch-
down when a pass interception
gave them the football on the
Wildcats’ 31 yard line. ~

Although Northwestern was not
able to get on the boards they did
show some potential in their of-
fensive unit.

In his novice varsity perform-
ance sophomore fullback Jim

Trimble had a spectacular after-
noon against the Wolverines, car-
rying the ball 20 times for a total
of 103 yards.

Trimble surpassed the 1961 rec-

“The kids are going to like him,” said Pitt's
Sports Information Director Dean Billick, in an-
nouncing the return of Charles (Chuck) Gottfried to
the Pitt football coaching staff. Dean Billick has
been proven to be a prophet.

Gottfried, who originally came to‘Pitt in Carl
DePasqua’s first year—1969-—has returned after a
two year stint with the Buffalo Bills of the National

aﬁwotball League.

, “I came back to Pitt because I left with a good

doing it the way
he has known how
for the past 21
years. He began
his collegiate
career at the Uni-
versity of Idaho
in 1954-56. From
there, Gottfried
moved to West
Point as defen-
sive line coach
for four years. At
Cornell, from
1963-67, he serv-
ed as both an of-
fensive line coach

and offensive co-ordinator.

After the 1969 season at Pitt, Chuck moved to
Buffalo.

Now he is back, and the defensive ends are glad
he is.

Never having held a head coaching job, except
in high school, Gottfried has the reputation of being
a great on-the-field coach. No wonder.

His voice rings out with the vigor of a lunch
whistle at a Pittsburgh steel’ mill; he looks like a
§-"Rarine drill sergeant; his voice rattles at a pace

~ equivalent to the most experienced auctioneer. So.

one might ask, why would a modern day ball player
like a guy like that?

When Chuck Gottfried’s face lights up with a
warm-pwelcoming smile, that question is quickly
answered. '

“I was delighted when I found out he was go-
ing, to coach the defensive ends,” said John Moss,
who had just been switched to that position (Moss
is now out with an injury). “I‘knew, Chuck when he
was at Cornell and he is both a great coach and a
great man.”

As far as Gottfried is concerned, that’s the

main reason he has coached for almost half of his"

life and go out to lunch and have them remember

the cigar smoking son—of-a-gun.”

While on the subject of cigar, Gottfried is very
fond of them to say the very least. He’d rather be
dead than be without cigars (he likes pipes too).

Once he returned to Pitt, Gottfried spent no
time re-establishing his style, which is unlike any
other Pitt coaches.

With his flat top haircut sitting proudly atop his
football worn body, Gottfried has gained the respect
of his subjects.

“You have to believe what he tells you,’ con-
vinced Jim Buckmon said after the first day of
practice under Gottfried. “Why, I learned things-
today that I never heard before. I like him.” Has
anybody noticed the improved play of the Pitt de-
fensive ends this year?

Though he might talkfast and loud, Gottfried
makes sense. How he treats his players is also ad-
mirable.

“I like his equality," noticed Eric Knisely. “He

9

pats you on the back if you do well and he yells at

you if you don’t, no matter who you are and what
string you’re on.”

But you really have to watch Gottfried in ac- »

tion to really appreciate him. Take what he said to
Rod Kirby, another end who has shown remarkable
progress, at one practice.

“Kirby, with your determination and. my coach-
ing, you’re going to make it.” ’
That’s Chuck Gottfried. Beautiful.‘

The Tartans will be flying sky high for Saturday’s contest and Pitt’

Last Sunday at the Pocono International Speedway, nestled in
Pennsylvania’s lush Pocono Mountain resort land, the University’s
Javelin overcame insurmountable odds and finished a strong second.

By the second place finish, the Javelin picked-up six points thus
moving the team into sole position of first place in the Northeastern
United States Sportscar Division.

The race at Poconos was termed “very satisfying” by driver Bob
Fryer because it capped-off many long nights of rebuilding and plan-
ning by the entire race team. .

Just to get the car into racing condition the team worked long and
late hours into the night on several occasions. The majority of the time
was spent on installing a new engine since the regular one had broken
the crankshaft at their previous race in Warren, Ohio.

Editor's Note: Concerning a let-

' ter, which pointed out deficiences

in Pitt’s»IM program, it was known
that the letter was blaming the
wrong part.

By printing it, however, it was
hopeful that a reaction would o_c-
cur, a reaction which would first
clear Leo Bemis, and a reaction
which might speeden the repair of

the lights. Hopefully both have‘

occurred. -Six letters were received
on the matter, none in defense of
Joseph Jaffe, who wrote the letter.

Not printing the story would
have resulted in a loss of .Iaffe's
and all student's rights—that is the
right to express an opinion. This of-
fice knows very well that Bemis
goes out of his way to publicize and
-better the IM program. Now hope-
fully, Jaffe knows it too.

To the Editor:
I would like to reply to the let-

ter on Monday, Sept. 25, written
by Joseph Jaffe, Law, ’74. This

‘sitter attacked Leo Bemis, direc-

tor of Intramural Athletics.

I hope I can set the record
straight on the situation of no
lights on the IM fields. When the
Field House parking lot was being
constructed, the main power line
was severed, resulting in a power
failure to the light standards.

The University" asked for re-
embursement, which resulted in
controversy as to who would pay
the re-embursement. This situa-
tion is still not rectified, although
Coach Bemis and Coach Bob Lew-
is pleaded for the lights.

On Sept. 13, Bemis called to in-
form me of the.‘ situation and ﬁked
jg’. Student Government might
come to his aid. I replied we would
and brought it to the attention of
the Student‘ Affairs Advisory
Committee. Andas I prepared a
formal letter to the Chancellor on
Sept. 15, I received another call
from Bemis, stating that he was
assured he would have the lights
on Tuesday, Sept. 19.

Much to Bemis’—Jaffe.’s and my

' dismay, there is still no light.

Bemis called University Engi-
neers, who assured him that work
was being done. But; complica-
tions had arisen. I brought it to

the Chancellor’s attention throuv

Mr. Kobel, who assured me ac-

Bemis Defendecl    

tion would be taken. I promise to
have the lights on as soon as possi-
ble or there will be some—hitting
the fan.

As for the IM basketball pro-
gram, Bemis does his best to get
referees for the games. He is only
one man and can only hope for vol-
unteers, although they are paid.
He has attempted to recruit, but
he can only do so much. As for
Jaffe, Law, ’74, your case against
Bemis wouldn’t stand up in a
kangaroo court. --

If you don’t want to do your
homework, don’t take a cheap
shot at a good man. You have
three alternatives: 1) Return to
Ann Arbor; 2) Slander the re-
sponsible party, or 3) If I may
quote you, “Shrug your shoulders
and walk away.”

It looks as though the Pitt soc-
cer team is much quicker than
coach Leo Bemis thought.

Bemis, in evaluating his team
before the season, had comment-
ed that it might be a ,‘‘little slow
rounding into shape.” However,
following the Panthers’ 2-0 vic-
tory over Bucknell and their 1-1
tie with a_ tough West Chester
team, it seems as though the boot-
ers have “shaped up” much bet-
ter than expected.

Not that Bemis’ concern was to-
tally unfounded.

For one thing,-the Panthers had
lost four starting players from
the ’7l season. Chucho Valenica,
a cat-like forward, had graduated,
along with halfback Tony Nicho-
lacoupolis and big Mike Pincus,
who had anchored Bemis’ full-
backing corps for four years.

To make matters worse, junior
halfback Gus Theofilos elected to
play professional soccer for the
