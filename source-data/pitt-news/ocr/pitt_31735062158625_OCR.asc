Pilsudski Is Greater
Hero In Peace

Than In War . . .

By SEYMOUR KERBER
The most important and Sig-
niﬁcant story in the n.ews of
last week was a two-inch item
in the corner of an inside page.
It‘ came from Vilno, Poland, in
the heart of intrigue——-torn. Eu-
rope.

Vilno is a province of Poland,
better known by its capital of the
same name. It lies in the north-
ernmost corner of Poland, an iso-
lated island between Lithuania
and White Russia. Wars have
been fought on this land on and
off for centuries: the Poles and
the Russians, the Lithuanians and
the Poles, the Russians and the
Lithuania-ns.

The threat of war has never
risen from this section of Europe.
Any conflict in Western Europe is
bound to include Vilno. And yet,
despite the frenzied rearmament

of the world’s nations, the extrav-
agent expenditure for war spon-
soring propaganda--

Bloodless Revolt

“One hundred newly—construct-
ed schools were opened this fall
in the province of Vilno in mem-
ory of Poland’s wartime hero, Mar-
shal Joseph Pilsudski, who died
May 12, 1935.”

Thus do the gods present their

forebodings. Education has long
been called the best anti-war
propaganda. Educational pro-

grams against war have met with
varying success. But there has
been no doubt that there is suc-
cess.

From a section of the earth that,
according to all convention should
be throwing every available pen-
ny, farthing, mark, yen, or franc
into the kettle of blood, comes the
news that there is to be a blood-
less revolt: War propagandizing
money is diverted to the cause of
education.

The Vilno cabinet ran a great
risk in voting such a move. The
money, not theirs to spend, was
collected by militant patriotic so-
cieties to build propaganda stat-
ues honoring a war hero. Instead,
the ministry of education proﬁted,
and the ministry of war applaud-
ed.

Proof Of Pudding

And now we divert the spotlight
to ourselves. Cannot we do the
same thing here and elsewhere?
Do we need a defensive (?) navy:
Do we need to pay bonuses when
education is starving, lit e r ally
starving?

Crime, we are told, cost Amer-
ica three times as much as edu-
cation. War, we are told by the
same propagandizers, is all right
sometimes. Both, I may add, are
attackers of education. The proof
is in the pudding, the cry against
war is from the educators.

Spain's war has, in many in-
stances, been tolerated and even
favored, by the church. The same
clergy are the most rampant ad-
vocaters of the campaign against
crime, so scathing that they vivid-
ly proclaim their disfavor of a
common-law marriage between
never—to-be-rescued man and W0-
man on a desert island.

War is crime; and it should be
treated as such. Following the
campaign against crime, let us di-
vert our war fostering expendi-
tures to the cause of a decrepit
American educational system.

Junior Women

At their ﬁrst of a series of class
forums today, junior women will

spent for motion picture equip-
ment. Some of these ﬁlms will
be run off during the meeting to

by the “Clair de Lune” of Claude
Debussey, the father of the mod-
ern movement; and a selection
from Igor Stravinsky’s, “Sacre du
Printemps,” whose bewildering
cacaphonies have made it a favor-
ite on concert programs all over
the world.

‘‘It will be interesting to see just
how the audience reacts to the
three divisions into which most
music is divided,” stated Robert
Brown, C39, head of the Concert
Hour committee. “We have tried
to make the selections representa-
tive, in order that the poll might
be fair.”

net, Dr. Alexander has been ac-
claimed by Pittsburgh political
commentators for his administra-
tion of the Department of Health.
He has secured an increased budget

for the department, and sponsored
Wassermann tests.

LEAGUE CHAIRMAN

Dr. Alexander was president of
the Allegheny County Medical So-
ciety during 1931-32. During the
1934 parrot fever outbreak, he was
the first doctor to warn Pittsburgh
about the seriousness of the disease.

As chairman of the Anti-Syph-
ilis league in Pittsburgh, Dr. Al-
exander has been in the lead in the
local drive against venereal dis-
eases. It was largely through his
cooperation that the recent drive of
the student health services and
The Pitt News for free Wasser-
mann tests was carried on.

SPEAKS HALF HOUR

Laboratory facilities of the

health department for analyzing
blood specimens were made avail-
able through Dr. Alexander. When
the number of studentstaking the
tests greatly exceeded expecta-
tions of the health services, health
department facilities were enlarged
to accommodate the overﬂow.
Final ﬁgures showed that a total
of 1,784 University students had
taken the free Wassermann test
during the two and one-half week
campaign.

At today’s Inquiry Forum meet-
ing, Dr. Alexander will address
the students for the ﬁrst half of the

California Has A Good
Football Team, Anyway

SIVIOOTII and slick is the method of con-
trolling campus newspaper opinion out in
California.

The Daily Californian, generally consider-
ed by collegiate journalism as an outtsanding
liberal college paper in the country, has re-
ceived notice that its one editor is to be ﬁve.

Editorship is to be divided among a board
of five, appointed by the school’s political or-
gan, the Student Executive Committee. Un-
der the guise of making the Californians pol-
icy more responsiple to the will of the student
body or dividing the work, the editor ’s pow-
ers will be decentralizee-:l into ﬁve heads if
the Executive C0mmit.tec’s proposal is adopt-
ed.

But somehow we don ’t think the committee
will bring forth a marvel, a la Dionne, with
these quintuplets. NO——this smacks too much
of the Roman and British tactic: Divide ct im-
pere. After the ﬁve men have ﬁnished discuss-
ing and seeing things from all sides and view-
ing it objectivclyaml compromising with each
other, much of nothing, we fear, will have been
accomplished.

"he reason for placing control of the paper
in campus politics may be that the Californian
editorials have become too progressive for the
rest of California.

Among the campaigns pushed by the pres-
ent‘ editor have been: abolition of compulsory
ROTC, a hot issue on the coast; a militant anti-
war movement; support of free speech on cam-
pus; and numerous other forward-looking con-
cepts.

It now appears that the paper will have to
ﬁght a battle for its own preservation. A news-
paper in politics—a.nd in some inane college
politics at that—becomes only 3. bulletin
board. ,

Because of the Ca.lifornian’s editorial. pol-
icy, we had believed that students of the
University of California were finally waking
up to what’ is happening in the world about
them. But if this move to stifle freedom of the
press is successful, we may have to put some
faith after all in that vicious description of
fair California.-——“the land of the prune, the
lemon, and the nut.”

Pcaccmakers
Armament Program

Pitt Peace Council will meet \Vcdnesday to
define policies, formulate plans, and hear an
address. Among the high. spots of the year’s
work for Council will be Peace Institute in
Feliriiary, Student Peace Week in April.

In the meantime we would comment on
Council ’s biggest job: exciting interest in stu-
dents for active, vigorous, and cooperative
peace movement. And we would remind stu-
dents of their part: understanding that Peace
can and soon may become an activity as en-
gaging as War.

‘We would suggest’ that Peace and Peace-
makers niust be no longer a negative quantity.
Arm-chair pcacemaking. is salutary no more.

In Which Due Credit
Is Duly Given

In thanking participants and aides in the re-
cent ‘Na'sseri'=nann test project, The Pitt News
inadvertently left out the names of Miss Lorena
Dobrick, nurse at the men ’s health service, and
Miss Virginia S-kiles, secretary at the women's
health service.

Miss Dobrilck and Miss Skiles, in keeping ap-
pointments straight, and getting test tubes
ready to be taken to the laboratories,. were of
great help to the doctors at the health services,
and The l\iews- takes this means of publicly
thanking them for helping the campaign go
over.

ii employers so long as they do not unite and

speak with one voice, time they were convinced
that the mere fact of being able wth more or
less skill to put words together one after an-
other on paper does not warrant their believ-
ing that by calling their work a profession
they become less subject to the manipulations
of those above them. They are employed.
They must protect themselves against the cm-
ployer, who will pay them as little and proﬁt
as much from their labor as they permit him.

I am on strike because the publisher of the
Brooklyn Daily Eagle, Preston Goodfellow,
like the meanest sweatshop owner, wants to
put into his own pockets dollars that should
go into the pockets of those who make his
paper for him, because he has, I believe, neither
integrity nor taste and is for that reason con-
tent to ruin the paper.

I like the Brooklyn Eagle. I have worked
on it for 20 years. I believe that I and the
other members of the Guild on strike are more
loyal to it and more eager to see it :3. good pa-
per than the man who is making a mess of it.

I am on strike because it is my opinion that
he is childishly ignorant of anything but
money, because he gives himself a half hundred
thousand dollars a year and then forces a
strike on the grounds that he cannot afford a
few small raises for the worst-paid members
of the staff.

I am, more speciﬁcally, on strike because as
a human being, regardless of his relations. with
his employes, he seems to me an inferior per-
son. Not to strike against him would be de-
grading.

I am glad to be on strike. I feel that now
for the ﬁrst time in my life,I am taking part
in the growth of civiliza.tion and not’ merely
looking on and calling myself a liberal. A
strike is an education. _ ,

I am on strike because it makes me feel good.

SIDE and 60

By Nick Spanos

Penn

If they were smart, all junior women interested
in becoming co—ed captains next year would [go
down and get a few tips from the Penn’s “Firefly”
which might have been called “How To Make A
ROTC Man, in Six Reels.”

In spite of its background of music, velvet and
lace, the picture’s approach to the problem of get-
ting military secrets from a soldier is very ‘realistic.
Jeannette MacDonald goes ‘to the very heart of
things by swinging out on a couple of “can-cans”
and arranging a dinner for her and the colonel,
with the colonel bringing the rooms.

Which is all getting us nowhere in a hurry and
taking up space that should be devoted to the
music. Rudolf Friml’s score is by now no means
new. Still its age does not interfere with its effects.
“Sympathy” and “Giannina Mia” are still as beau-

. tiful as ever.

And that brings us down to the costumes which
were also beautiful with Allan Jones in a support-
ing role. Allan is ﬁlling Nelson Eddy’s shoes in a
much too capable manner to make it comfortable
for Nelson‘. I have it on very reliable authority

that two fat women of forty, who were later iden- »

tiﬁed as house mothers‘ for the Delts, swooned when
Jones hit high B.
Stanley

The art lovers amongst you can have a half

dozen Shangri Las and a couple of Zolas for good"
measure. But for entertainment, I’ll take the bill

, now at the Stanley.

Ever since “It Happened One Night” pictures
have been trying to be like it and this is one that
succeeds.

girl and‘ then becomes a success as an artist, which
sounds like pure coincidence.

Everything is on a very Bohemian plane and that
always makes for amusement. The dialogue‘ is
smart and very funny; so is Robert Benchley. That
last was understatement, but we’ll let it pass.

Benchley portrays an’ amiable, domesticated‘

ed-runk, living with people who are a little bit

screwy. His‘ obsbervations of what goes on are
something none‘ of you should miss. If you don’t
see this at the Stanley, be sure to see it at your

local opera house.

Ted Lewis is on‘ the stage. He’s been on the

is'tag‘e" ever since he was fourteen and isn’t even a

little bit tired yet. People have been seeing him
ever since he was fourteen and they aren’t even a
little bit tired yet. From the sounds of the audi-
ence Friday they won’t ever get tired.

Mr. Lewis has a way of holding an audience in
the palm of his hand and twisting it around with
his hat that no one on the stage today can ap-
proach. This week he brings an all-new show to
town, and the only criticism we can offer is- that
he” gives us too much‘ of acrobats and dancers and‘
not enough of’ Lewis;

The Queen Ant Is Nonplussed

Today the Queen Ant was
serving the workers.

walking among the ranks, ob-

She was pleased. Everything was in

harmony, which, considering the recent election, was rather

astounding.

All the l'ema.les who were not too thoroughly decapitated -

were back at work. Swathed

went about their industries with‘?

as much agility as possible. The
Master Worker had taken over
her new duties and was ostensi-
bly running the society, although
no one seemed to be paying atten-
tion to her.
EVERYONE WORKING

And so the Queen Ant smiled.
Everything, she considered to her-
self,» everything was c“oI-ning along

ﬁne. The old routine had been
restored, and the Queen, with
monarchial dignity, strutted

among the masses.

Bella, who ran the delicatessen,
was struggliiig with a slice of
grub, while her workers were busy
classifying bits‘ of grasshopper
and cricket rneat. »

Princess Marguerite was hust-
ling among the architects and
house-builders, supervising the
construction of a new tunnel un-
der the ant" hill. “Come, come,”
she intonated, wriggling her an-
tennae. “We’ve got to get ﬁnish-
ed with that first anti-chamber‘ by
tonight. Let’s snap it up!”

The Queen Ant went by mur-
muring, “Fine, ﬁne. Anybody
could tell Marguerite for one of
my heirs. And, oh, there’s
Daphne!”

THE DAY’S LE-‘ssozv

Daphne was her youngest, but,
as she often said, “really her most
intelligent and ambitious.” Daphne
was a teacher. Her classes were
composed of all the youngsters;
her daily subjects included Man-
ners, Morals, Methods, and Indus-
try. As the Queen sauntered up
to the clearing, a bare spot under-
neath the clover
had just glanced at the sun, reck-
oned that it was time to proceed
with her Industry class. The
Queen Ant listened.

“Children,-today we shall study
the theories of accomplishment.
Brieﬂy, they are, ﬁrst, all work-
ers were born to work; second,
all workers should show a love
for their vocations; third, all
workers must enter into their du-
ties with all their might and main;
fourth, no worker must waste
time. As the scholar once said,
‘Tempus fugitt’, And it really

in bandages and splints, they

patch, Daphne ,

does. Now I want all of you to
get down to our apprentice du-
ties at once. Class is dismissed.”

The Queen Ant saw the young-
sters rush away /from the clear-
ing,’ shrieking lustily. She got
out of the way just in time to
avoid being crushed into‘ the mud.
“Daphne put that across ﬁne,” she
said. “Especially that ,business
about ‘tempus fugit.’ But those
youngsters will have to learn to
save their energy for more worth-
while pursuits. Hmm, nearly ran
me down.”

WORKERS FAST

As she left the clearing, the
Queen Aunt passed a brown,
cracked maple leaf, through a
slit in which the sun was
sprinkling its rays, she thought
she noticed one of the females.

“Well,” she whistled, crawling

under the blade. “What’s this?”
_ A worker was curled up com-
fortably-——-sleeping. “Say, ' why
aren’t you at work?” the Queen
bellowed, shaking the sleeper
with both of her forelegs. “Come,
wake up and explain yourself!”

“What dya mean, work?” the
worker mumbled, sleepily. “I’m
tired. Just taking a nap.”

“Just taking a nap!” her maj-

esty mimicked. “You can’t be
one of my workers. All my peo-
ple are industrious. They nap at

proper times: when it’s night. But
now the sun’s out and there’s
work to be done. Come, stir your-
self, or I’ll have you thrown in
the catacombs.”
NO PLAY GIRLS

“But, please‘, Missus, I’m not
one of. your tribe. Do you mean
that people up here work all day?
That would drive me to distrac-
tion. When do they get a chance
to have fun? I don’t see why
they work all day?”

“My people aren’t sluggards and
they aren’t playgirls; they keep
busy—-as busy as they can. That’s

their fun. Where did you get the I

idea-?”

“Waal,” she drawled. “I guess
I just don’t see the sense of it.
And now, pardon me, I want to
finish my nap.”

Mrs. Downs Stresses
Library As Study Aid

By Robert Adams

“VVe waiit students to use the facilities of the University
library to the fullest extent as an aid to study.”

Thus expressing the opinion of the library staff, Mrs. Helen
H. Downs, lending librarian, explained that students sometimes
appreciate the beauty of the library without realizing its ad-
vantages as a source of information. I

“To get students to feel at home in the library, to secure

the information the want-—that¢

is the aim of the library ‘staff.
We’re always glad to answer
questions on any phase of the li-
brary,” said Mrs. Downs.

Important as one of the two
main divisions of the library is
the lending department, under
Mrs. Downs’ supervision. All
books loaned by the University li-
brary go through some division of
the lending department, which in-
cludes the delivery hall, the All-
dred room, reserve book room,
and the women’s reading room.

PROCEDURE EXPLAINED
Procedure for borrowing books

begins in the ﬁfth ﬂoor public ‘

catalogue ' room, which contains
alphabetical ﬁles listing all books
in the libraryl by author, title,
and subject. On book request
slips obtainable in the catalogue
room, students list the class num-

«ber of the book wanted, title, au-

thor, and their own name and ad-
dress. ‘

Presenting the book request
slips at the desk in the delivery
hall, the student receives a num-
befed metal check. Book request
slips are stamped with the time
received’ and sent through pneu-
matic tubes to the book stacks.

FICTION POPULAR

In- the stacks, one of th three‘
library pages .locates the volumes
and sends them with the request
slips through a revolving elevator
system to the delivery desk. When
the books arereceived at the desk,
the number of the check given the
student is ﬂashed on a lighted
panel. .

Most volumes of ﬁction are
loaned for one week, and non-
ﬁction works  for two weeks.
Books may be ‘renewed for simi-
lar periods if no requests for them
have been received in the mean-
time. Fines for overdue books
are charged at a ﬂat rate of two
cents per day.

To borrow books listed in the
card catalog‘ as belonging to the

Alldried-i collection, students should «

take book request slips to the de-
livery hall, where an index show-
ing the location of all Alldred
books is kept. Shelves in the All-
dred room hold 3,000 books, but
the collection comprises over 6,000
volumes».

Editor, The Pitt News:

I-n answer to the letter of your
Senator Gerald Ziskind, I beg
leave to remark that in View of
the Senator’s record in public
life, he is not quite the person to
point the ﬁnger of scorn. I am by‘
no means to be considered a con-
servative‘ in the same class with
Florence Fisher Pariah or Walter
-“the sell-out” Lippmann.

Placing in such‘ a, category is a
vile innuendo. And I resent it. I
am not a conﬁrmed believe-‘r in
preserving, the useless institutions
of the “old order,” nor’  I a
parlor pink. ' '

If you can consider a conserva-
tive as one who pleads for living
wages, a world government, a;
world of peace and cooperation,
as against war and competition-—
then I AM A CONSERVATIVE.

.As for Senator Zizkind, who
persists in projecting his person-
ality into the universe, I have
only enthusiastic praise for his
ﬁne humanitarian efforts in be-
half of that ﬁne
Franklin Delano Roosevelt’.

Senator Ziskind is certainly a
scholar and a gentleman and a
good judge of milk.

Panthers Change Routine,
Score Early Against Lions

Pitt Acquires

Third November

Victory, 23-7

By LEONARD LEVISON
Sports Editor

“It’s just about the finest
‘thing I have ever seen in the
‘way of a college football team.
In fact‘, I have never seen any
better Pitt, or for that matter,
any better school outﬁt.”

Thus‘ spoke Robert Higgins,
dean of Penn State touchdownOl-
Ogy. He was standing in the dress-
ing room Saturday afternoon just

after the Panthers had completed

their exodus from the Stadium for
the current season.

And he was, obviously, refer-
ring to the football team that he
had just spent a bleary-eyed after-
noon watching.

ANOTHER TRAIT

He had observed the Panthers
at their seasonal best. For this is
November, and the “too—good-to-
be-true” Panthers had won their
third game of the month by
squashing his Nittany Lions, 28-7.

Each Saturday seems to bring
out another virtue in the Pitt
team. This week—end it was a
measure of consideration that they
showed, consideration for their
coach, Dr. Jock Sutherland, who
had spent a somewhat uneasy
week anticipating an apparently
inevitable mental let-down in his
team.

SCORE SOON

Dr. Sutherland was relieved of
all discomﬁture very early in the
afternoon. Just about nine and
one-half minutes after the game
got under way, the Panthers shov-
ed across their ﬁrst seven points.

It was the result of a 55-yard
march that occurred the second
time Pitt acquired the ball. Mar-
shall Goldberg ran, and Marshall
Goldberg passed to Bill Daddio,
and Marshall Goldberg blocked for
Curly Stebbins, and there was Pitt
on the 1—yard line.

Frank Patrick steamed through
the center for the touchdown,
after which Frank Souchak, with
head petriﬁed downward, toed the
ball right through the uprights for
the extra point.

GOLDBERG AGAIN

Pitt’s next score was not as long
coming up. Six minutes later
Goldberg crashed into the end
zone from the 1,§-yard line. This
was the culmination of another 55-
yard advance which had its be-
ginnings when Don Hensley inter-
cepted a ﬂat pass on his own 45-
yard mark. Similarly, Goldberg
was the main ground-gainer in
this parade.

The Panthers proceeded through
Penn State during this ﬁrst quar-
ter with such smoothness that the
play smacked of that Pitt fourth
«quarter ﬂavor. Instead of waiting
until the last period to engender
their scoring power, the Panthers
blasted it out in the ﬁrst few mo-
ments. This was hardly running
true to form.

LONG RUN

With the second team entered
in the second period, another
touchdown" was added. Sopho-
more Dick Cassiano, with a few
rather graceful hip-swings, headed
out around his own right end,
picked up a blocking escort, accel-
erated his step, and by the time he
reached the Penn State 20-yard
line there was no one within
hailing distance. His touchdown
run was fully 79 yards from the
.line of scrimmage.

Penn State’s rather well-earned
score occurred in the third period.
Barantovich recovered an Urban
fumble on the Pitt .24. After a
few yardage losses, “VVindy” Wear
tossed a high, arching pass to end
Sid Alter for the Lion’s touch-
down.

HENSLEY STARS

Pitt tallied in the ﬁnal period,
with the ﬁrst team back on the
ﬁeld, on a 53-yard drive. Gold-
berg, who, incidentally, threw two
successful passes Saturday, pro-
pelled himself Over on a center
buck from the 7-yard mark.

Hardly a fair judgment could’
be passed On the Lions. Pitt just
made them look bad. And then,
too, the Panther’s early score more
or less unnerved Penn State. The
Lions showed a great’ backﬁeld
duo in “Windy” Wear and Hair-
breadth Harry Harrison, the two
lightweights. Johnny Economosat
guard and end Alex Barantovich
were outstanding on the Penn
State line.

Bill Daddio came back into full
active participation Saturday and
looked every bit the great end that
he is. Don Hensley also contrib-
uted a choice bit of center play to
the all-around Pitt line and back-
ﬁeld excellence.

Lambda Chis Meet Phi
Eps, Delts Clash
With Phi Delta Theta

Semi-ﬁnalists in the upper
bracket of the Interfraternity
elimination tourney were decided
last Thursday when Lambda Chi
Alpha defeated Theta‘ Chi, 12-6,
and Phi Ep downed Phi Kappa,
12-0, in second round tilts.

Theta Chi, with a little help
from Dame Fortune, struck swift-
ly in the ﬁrst quarter to register
their only score against the pow-
erful Lambda Chis.

Bricker took the ball on the
ﬁrst play after the kickoff and
tossed one to John Byers Over the
goal line. Mann, halfback for
Lambda Chi, in attempting to
break up the pass, tipped the ball
into Byer’s hands and Theta Chi
went into the lead, 6-0.

MANN STARS

Lambda Chi came back with a
{touchdown in the Second quarter
1 to tie up the old ball game. Mann,
lwho roamed all over Schenley
iOval to play a bang up game for
Lambda Chi, intercepted a Brick-
er pass intended for Byers and
raced 35 yards for a score.
Early in the next period, Mann
again crossed Theta Chi’s goal line
with the ball to put the Lambda
Chis in the lead and into a semi-
ﬁnal match with the Phi Eps.

PHI KAPS LOSE

The Phi Eps earned the right
to face Lambda Chi by overpow-
ering a strong Phi Kappa team,
12-0.

Phi Ep tallied in the ﬁrst pe-
riod through the air, Marks to
Kotler, by a perfect aerial that
saw Mac Marks, protected by
splendid blocking, fade back, and
throw a bullet pass 20 yards_ into
the arms of Jack Kotler. ,

Their ﬁnal score came late in
the third period. Vatz, Phi Ep’s
crack center, recovered a fumbled-
lateral deep in Phi Kap territory.
They scored on the next play
which was a pass from Hirsch to
Marks.

Tomorrow, the two second
Iround survivors meet, as do Delta
Tau Delta, and Phi Delta Theta
on Schenley Oval to ﬁght it out
for ﬁnal berths.

The Pitt Riﬂe team downed’ the

J. I. Davis, of Westinghouse,
former National Small Bore cham-

to report.

At a meeting held Tuesday,
November’ 9 -in‘ the Cleveland
Athletic Club in Cleveland for
the purpose of discussing the
future of the proposed hockey
league in which Pitt has been
invited to participate,» Carl Ol-

Pitt would deﬁnitely be interested
in the program.

Olson spoke unofficially for Pitt,
and made no committments, but
it was generally understood that
Pitt will be a party in the league
should it materialize.

EIGHT SCHOOLS PRESENT

Eight schools, including Akron

Carrol, Pitt and Western Reserve,
were represented at the confer-

to the meeting, only Case, Akron,

Of the colleges sending delegates l .

against Franklin and Marshall “Cl

College on February 5, the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh
team is looking forward to one of
its most successful seasons, with

possibly the Eastern Intercolle-
giate Swimming toga as a reward
for its endeavors.

“Without a doubt this is the
best swimming team that I have
ever seen at the University,” said
Russ Lindberg, ﬁrst assistant to
Patt Corr, head coach of the
acquatic team, in an early season
statement. Mr. Lindberg went on
to say that, forebearing any un-
forseen ineligibilities, the Panther
natators should go through their
difficult schedule undefeated.

LEDERSTEIN LEADS

The Pitt swimmers displayed
remarkable prowess
when they captured, without too
much diﬁiculty, the A;'A. U. meet
held in the Metropolitan Club
pool. Led by Milt Lederstein,
who captured ﬁrst place in the
100-yard free—style, the Panther
poolmen had little difficulty edg-

ing out a strong Franklin and

Marshall squad.

Beside the excellent form dis-
played by Lederstein, Tom Ander-
son copped the honors in the 50-
yard" sprint. He was followed by
Hyman Lederstein, who took sec-
ond place.

Tom Locke, captain of the team,
and Al Beacon took second and
third, respectively in the 100-
yard race.

FRESHBIEN OUTSTANDING

Vieing for honors on this year’s
Pitt team are Lederstein and
Locke in the distance races; An-
derson, Morris and Robert Schra-
der, a sophomoresensation, in the
backstroke; Alex Slabodian in
the backstroke and distance; Bill
Brown and Steve Rodnok as div-
ers.

Freshmen who have been giv-
ing the varsity men more than

enough competition for outstand-

ing honors are Felix Kurkicz, An-
drew Manko and Verdi Schulner.
These boys demonstrated their
class in the recent A. A. U. meet
and can be looked upon as val-
uable varsity" timber next season.

CORR SEEKS MEET

Coach Corr" is trying to bring
the Eastern Intercollegiate‘ Cham-
pionship meet to Pittsburgh this
year, and as things shape now he
will more than likely be success-
ful. Speaking for Mr. Corr, coach
Lindberg also intimated that Corr
will take his best men to the Na-
tional A. A. U. and National In-
tercollegiate Championship‘ meets
coming later in the season.

penses will make their participa-
tion improbable."

At Case there are a few ques-
tionable matters to be ironed out
before its Athletic Council moves
on the proposed league.

Pitt’s stand on ice hockey has
not been officially divulged, but
all indications point to active’ mem-
bership in the league.

The salient idea’ developed in
the meeting was that the program
would, in its‘ entirety, belong to
the colleges. The position of
Duquesne Garden and the Cleve-
land Arena would only be of a ‘
physical nature, in that they will
furnish facilities for practice and
playing.

It was decided that no formal
organization will be effected until
Case and Akron have taken either
a pro Or con stand as far as actual
entrance in the league is con-
cerned.

Ice hockey was revived on the
Pitt campus last year when Bob
Schooley organized a band of
players from Pitt students and
played Tech and Duquesne teams
on the Garden ice.

Dance Stories

‘Under The Bushel’
Oﬁers Dance Comps
For Best Answers

Thirty-two Dages of “umph” for
15 cents are what Tom Smith, C39,
editor, promises in the Thanksgiv-
ing issue of The Pitt Panther,
monthly humor magazine, which
makes its appearance Wednesday.

Featuring the issue will be an
article titled “Jock and I” by Frank
Miller, C41, in which lines, foot-
ball and the other kind, will be
thoroughly discussed. The article
is the result of a poll taken from
the campus smoothies whose lines
are deﬁnitely successful.

“Stowaway” by Estelle Kovacs,
C40", an ironical tale of an adven-
ture in South America and its
connection with an embezzling
syndicate will be the story of the
month.

A complete picture story of the
work done by dance committees on
the campus is included in the
Panther. The article will feature
photographs of the Freshman
Dance Committee in action taken
by Charles Conick, C39.

“Under the Bushel,” question-
naire test is offering compliment-
ary tickets to Freshman Dance to
those students submitting the
largest list of correct answers.

Disclosure of facts has caused
the editors of the Panther to once
again publish the Campus Index
Page with a new classiﬁed rating
of schools and students.

WAA To Hold

And The Dean
  Had,Notliing
  I, To Say

By DAN CANNON

This forlorn reporter spends
most of his time in Graduate
School ofﬁce in State hall, vainly
awaiting any happenings that
might be interpreted as news by
anybody but those gifted with a
facile imagination.

But today was different. A neat
young man with dark circles under
his eyes made an appearance, an-
nouncing himself as Mr. Albrach,
day editor for the Associated Press
in Pittsburgh. A momentous oc-
casion!

Vague thoughts of faculty tenure
investigations, football subsidiza-
tion, and labor trouble passed
through my mind. What could be
the purpose of his visit? The
young man cleared his throat and
began:

“The Western Pennsylvania Res-
taurant Owners Association is
holding its annual convention in
Pittsburgh during January. They
will hold a contest for the most
beautiful waitress. I would like
to get a statement from Dr. Root
as to whether the presence of a
beautiful waitress is beneﬁcial or
detrimental to the digestive pro-
cesses.”

Quick work on the part of Dr.
Root’s charming secretaries pre-
vented The Pitt News reporter
from jumping out the window.

Forum Hears

Talk On Peace

Dr. Charles G. Fenwick, profes-
sor of political science at Bryn
Mawr College, will speak on “The
Price of World’s Peace” at Com-
munity forum this evening at
8:15 o’clock in the Schenley high
school auditorium.

Dr. Fenwick is president of the

Catholic Peace society. He was
educated at Loyola College and
Johns Hopkins University. From
1911 to 1914 he served as law clerk
with the Carnegie Peace Founda-
tion.
He lectured at Washington Col-
lege until 1918, when he joined
the faculty of Bryn Mawr. Dr.
Fenwick is the author of “The
Neutrality Laws of the United
States.”

Of City Industry

New industries must be devel-
oped in the Pittsburgh district if
its past industrial supremacy is to
be maintained, according to Dr.
Glenn E. McLaughlin, associate
professor of industrial research and
member of the University’s Bu-
reau of Business Research.

Speaking Friday afternoon at
the second Social Science Seminar
of the year, Dr. McLaughlin dis-
cussed “The Economic Future of
the Pittsburgh District.”

In his paper, Dr. McLaughlin
pointed out that Pittsburgh’s in-
dustries reached their maturity at
the beginning of the century. They
were aided by low-cost fuel, steel,
and water transportation, which,
said Dr. McLaughlin, has been one
of the city’s great advantages. If
industries reach their peak and
new industries do not arise, then a
district declines.

N0 NEW INDUSTRIES

Since 1900 no new major indus-
tries have come to Pittsburgh. The
radio industry exerted a little in-
ﬂuence, but shifted its center away
from Pittsburgh. The auto indus-
try is at its lowest peak here since
