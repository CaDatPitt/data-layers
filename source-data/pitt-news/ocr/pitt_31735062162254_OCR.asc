vol. 63, No. 74

HARRISBURG AP--The Senate
passed a no-fault car insurance bill
Tuesday that would cut bodily
injury premiums by 12 per cent and
provide quick settlement of acci-
dent claims.

The 46-2 vote came after the
legislation survived several weeks
of attempts to revise or weaken it.

The measure, supported by the
Shapp administration, was sent to
the House where it's expected to
receive an extensive reworking.

The 12 per cent premium
reduction would affect only the
personal injury portion of auto-
mobile insurance and not property
damage. The average cost for
bodily injury insurance is about

. $60, sponsors said, so a motorist

would save $7.20 a year under the
bill. ‘«

Bodily iniury insurance would be
mandatory under the bill. About 20
per cent of the state's motorists do
not now have that coverage,
sponsors said.

No-fault is aimed at providing an
accident victim prompt settlement
of claims regardless of who was at
fault in the accident. However, his
right to sue for intangible pain and
suffering damages would be
sharply limited.

The reduction of so-called
nuisance lawsuits is the key to
bringing down’ insurance pre-
miums, sponsors say. .

Under the measure, an accident

victim would receive from his own
insurance company unlimited
reimbursements for medical ex-
penses and up to $9,100 in lost
wages due to the accident.

The insurance company would
have to settle the claim within 30
days or pay penalties.

An accident victim could not sue
for more unless his medical or
hospital expenses exceeded $750 or
suffered permanent loss of an
important body function or severe
cosmetic disﬁgurement.

Sponsors believe the $750 ceiling
or threshold would bar most
lawsuits which often result in
inﬂated settlements that drive up
insurance rates for everyone. I

Both the Senate and House
passed no-fault legislation in the
1972 session but a compromise
agreement died in the closing
moments of the session.

Early last year the Senate again
tried to move a no-fault bill but
opponents managed to riddle it
with amendments and the bill was
tabled until about three weeks ago.

Opponents again attempted to
hit it with amendments butexcept
for one, which was later wiped out.
they were unsuccessful.

The key amendment defeated
Tuesday would have lowered the
medical threshold to $500. Senator
Joseph Ammerman, D-Clearﬁeld,
who managed the bill through the
tight, said the amendment would

to 6%. It was rejected on a 29-19
vote. —

Five other amendments were
turned back Tuesday before the
final vote.

The legislation would not be
effective until one year
enactment.

In ﬁnal floor speeches, Senator
Henry Hager, R-Lycoming, who
tried futilely to amend the bill,
called its limitation on lawsuits
unconstitutional, saying the people
have a right to their day in court.
He also contended the departure

Commissioner Herbert Denenberg

The new bill specifies students

Vrana Announces New

Dorm Cleaning Policy

BY CONNIE GIEL

A new residence hall main-
tenance cleaning policy will coin-
cide with next year’s room rate
increase. according to Housing
Director John Vrana, who cited a
need to clear up misconceptions on
the part of students and University
officials.

Vrana stressed the new policy
was effective only in the change of
He

basis_ instead of the present
biweekly system.

The Housing Director empha-
sized that cleaning of heavily used
areas, such as bathrooms, will be
maintained on a daily basis in the
case of the Towers and Lothrop
Street residences, and weekly in
the suites.

“This won't have much impact
anyway, because most of the
students keep their rooms pretty
clean themselves,” Vrana said.

was not over the necessity of the

cost increases, but the justification ' A

of those increases.

“It’s very simple,” Stuart said, . :_
“we don’t care about the sur-,‘

“The commission (ICC) tried to .
put out a fire, and they allowed"
everyone in the country to take the ,-

large carriers did not take the full

“How can you maintain a stable
industry when one group can take

Vrana Announces New
Dorm Cleaning Po/icy

(Continued frornPi1ge I)

In order to facilitate this new
policy, a redefinition ofthe working
staffs is taking place. A layoff
involving about ten or twelve
people, evenly distributed among
“light and heavy cleaners" will
occur, with-the‘ layoffs adhering to

- the union's seniority system.

Those workers involved will be
absorbed into the University's
employment ranks, or are being
relocated into new iobs.

Vrana distinguished between
these cleaners and the main-
tenance staff citing increased
structural maintenance next year
as the reason for an increase of the
maintenance staff.

“Well, our buildings are, or
course, getting older., Even the
Towers will be 11 years old next
year. So we’re going to have to do
a lot of renovating, such as painting

‘and heavy work.

“This year _we’re going to
concentrate on Amos and Bracken-
ridge, whereas last year we spent a
lot oftime in McCormick. All these
buildings need a good shot in the
arm," Vrana said. .

Vrana assured students this new
system will not affect any of the
other housing services, such as the
linen exchange or the security
system. "‘These other things will
not change," he said.

advocated changes in the sur-

necessary to justify increases.
“When I made that speech in

“have contracts for their fuel with

companies like Exxon, and some of
them even do their own refining.

Ronald Carlisle, “This site has
already yielded a great amount of
information concerning the life-
ways of the people who lived there.

“The focal point of the excava-
tions includes the recovery of
artifacts but _extends to an analysis
of the ecological adaption which
these early Pennsylvanians made
to the rigors of the world in which
they lived.

“It is necessary to recover these
data archaeologically since some-
. time after 1650, all traces of the

Monongahela culture mysteriously

disappears." '

Diaries and accounts left by early
European explorers include
descriptions of Pennsylvania's

Milani claimed the new ice

by the House March. 18th, it was
resubmitted to the Appropriations
Committee. According to commit-
tee chairman‘H. Jack Seltzer, it
may be there for some time. ‘

‘‘We’ve got about 500 bills in
here right now. This bill is down
there somewhere and we’ll keep
plugging along until we reach it.”

Democratic legislator James
Romanelli, representing the 22nd
legislative district, of which the
University is a part, wants quicker
action. V

“If that bill isn’t- out of the
Appropriation Committee soon,
Pm going to" offer a discharge
resolution. If 25 members sign it,
the bill must come out as it stands
and we’ll consider it as such.

“I’ll have to check the mood of

the legislature,” said Romanelli.
“If ‘they're not being recalcitrant
about spending. I may offer
amendments to the bill. I’ve had
"input from various schools in
Pittsburgh to push the maximum
grant" to $2000 "and the family
income limit to $20,000.

“Upping the grant to $1,500 is

-really just a cost of living increase.
The family income provision is the
important thing about the bill.”

According -to Seltzer, however,
the only reason the bill has been
introduced is the $9.4 million
appropriation to PHEAA:

“The minimum and maximum
aid standards can be set by the
PHEAA administration. The issue
here is that we’ve already
appropriated $65 million to
PHEAA, and now they need $9
million or so more.”

Both legislators agreed the mood
of the legislature toward spending
will determine when and in what
form the bill goes thrbugh.

‘They

‘ BY TOM SMITH
“It‘s- been four years and all this

.. time we have known our son did not
'. - do anything for which he deserved

‘to be punished, let alone shot.”
William Schroeder was nineteen

 years old when he committed his

crime. In May President Nixon had
announced American troops were

A being sent into Cambodia to clean

out the Viet Cong sanctuaries to
bring peace to the world. The chief
executive was concerned only with
saving American lives.

Violent protests erupted on
college campuses throughout the
nation. Kent State University’s
ROTC was burned to the ground.
Ohio Governor James Rhodes

~ called out the National Guard to

preserve order. The next day four
college students were shot and
killed in Kent, Ohio.

William Schroeder had been
sentenced to death for his criminal
dissent. Four more Americans had
lost their lives to provide the
United States with an honorable
peace in Vietnam.

Four years later one present
member and seven former mem-
bers of the Ohio National Guard
have been indicted for offenses
related to the killing of Schroeder
and three other students, Allison
Krause, Jeffrey Miller, and
Sandra Scheuer. Four years later
the United States government is
ﬁnally attempting to serve iustice.

But the Kent State indictments
are four years late. In itself this is a
tragedy for a nation dedicated to
the administration of justice. This
incident should be recorded as one
of the darkest moments in the

.. history of a country based on
C principles of freedom, justice, and

equality. .

As in'the My Lai massacre, so
typical of American involvement in
the Vietnam War, the United
States government will not be held
criminally responsible for the
senseless deaths in Kent, Ohio.
William Calley was sentenced to
life imprisonment, but those
responsible for programming the
machine which killed 102 Viet-
namese, still are allbwed to

‘function as respectable citizens of

society.

In 1970 college students were not
considered respectable citizens.
They were branded as “bums," by
the President of the United Staes,
the Vice-President, the Attorney
General, and the Governor of Ohio.
These high ranking governmental
ofﬁcials were motivated by a desire
to build political support ”for a
president. who had failed to gain
the overwhelming adoration of the
American people after a year and a
half in ofﬁce.

Governmental officials were
responsible for the political polari-
zation of the generations. Never
before in recent history had this

i V nation turnedagainst its youth.

The result was Kent State.
After all, the guardsmen were

' not shooting at the future of the

country of the hope of the nation.
shot at “hoodlums,'
“bums," “the worst type of people
we harbor in America," the scum
of society. They did not shoot at
human beings. but rather a
dissenting point of view which was
interpreted by some as an
embarassment to the nation and to
the leader of the nation.

Like Calley. the guardsmen who
pulled the triggers cannot escape
responsibility for their deed. Every
human being must account for his
individual actions, whether he

lnevitably those who created the
mood in the nation which allowed
loaded guns to be pointed at
students will not have to account
for their actions in the courts. But,
they will have to live with
themselves as American society
has had to live with the murders of
Kent State. Kent State will not be
erased .from history.
. All Americans have been affec-
ted by Kent State. The four
students, the nine other wounded
students, the eight guardsmen, all
the families have been affected
directly. The nation will suffer

because Kent State was allowed to ’

happen. .
We have an obligation to be
certain Kent State never happens

 
 
  

again. It must always be
remembered that the youth of
America are the nation’s hope and
not its decay.

In 1967 the late Robert Kennedy
wrote. "Our answer is the world's
hope; it is torely on youth...this

generation at home and around the‘

world has had thrust upon it a
greater burden of responsibility
than any generation that has ever
lived."

William Schroeder was one of
many students who accepted that
responsibility on May 4. 1970. On
that day William Schroeder and
three other students killed at Kent
State became the victims of a
senseless perversion of the demo-
cratic processes of American
government.

 

Oakland Expressway:

Clear to the People?

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

The Oakland Crosstown Express-
way has surfaced again in a
planning agency's transportation
proposals for the city and county
area.

The highway would cut through
and eliminate ‘parts of Panther
Hollow and several local residential
areas.. Proposed by the South
Western Pennsylvania Regional
Planning Commission (SWPRPC)
the expressway will connect the
South Hills with the North Hills.

Once again we are faced with the
question of public versus private
welfare borne on the momentum of
a bureaucracy in motion. This is an

Black Studies: Glarification

An article entitled, “Black
Studies: Out of Crisis into
Maturity--New Generation Coming
[March 29] incorrectly, due to
typographical error, attributed
quotes in the latter portion of the
story to Emmanuel Anise instead of
Curtiss Porter. The following is a

clarificaition written by Porter, an --

assistant professor in the black
studies department.

BY CURTISS E. PORTER

I would like to point out three
things which do not come through
clearly in the recent article on Black
Studies (this is due to error and an
attempt to create a ‘conversational
debate’ out of three separate
interviews; which misleads and
misinforms the readership):

Black Studies is (from my
perspective) essentially a con-
sciousness transformation unit.
Engaged in the transformation of
consciousness from enslaved to
free. It is in this sense that Black
Studies will ‘be established by its
ability to realize an essentially
African way of being in the world.

This “Africaness” is more than
nationality and ethnicity in this
sense; it is a bio-genetic, historical,
and philosophical psycholtﬁy of
being in the world that is manifest
and economic
continuum of the African world
experience. At this point, in 1974,
one hardly needs to make the case
that all black people are African,
and it is this collective experience
that is meant by an “African way of
viewing [and being in] the world.”

This task in the hands of the
Black Studies practitioner is much
less ‘a reaction to a European-
imposed experience than it is the
maintenance of historical. psycho-
logical and political continuity. The
success of Pan-Africanism and the
imperatives of Third World revolu-
tionary thought will make this
increasingly clear.

This is the general picture of
Black Studies for which the various
specialists in the discipline labor to
complete. The unidentiiiccl quote
on page 7. “Black Studies...rcali2.e
an essentially African way of
viewing the world" which l believe
to be inv own is incorrect and has
this sense in its correct meaning.
The major point being that Black
Studies is an institutional response
to Black activism.

The requirement for Black
education will find its philosophical
root in the African Being as that

being has experienced the world;
and this, according to the correct
analysis of material conditions and
a liberating synthesis of the
conscious and unconscious psychic
dimensions of that experience.

A primary question in Black
Studies then will remain the
question of methodology both in
the acquisition of the tools of

‘consciousness transformation’ and .

in exposition of the information,
perspectives, research and ideation
essential to the discipline. Some of
these tools will be ones we are
familiar with (teaching, research,
publication, creativity, etc.) and
some will be ground out of the
Black experience at a level only
hinted at in the early obiectives of
Black Studies. Black Studies began
and will remain an intense nexus of
the academic and the activist ﬁeld
of social endeavor. The attempt to
split the polarity of this particular
dynamic relationship is like desir-
ing the fruits of a right to work,
academic freedom, faculty rights,
and tenure without wishing "to
engage in either the development
struggle to make it possible.

On the issue of professional
development in Black Studies it
should be made clear that the
discipline will generate its own
‘experts’; and that expertise in
other fields are to that extent,
limited in their ideal value. On the
specific case of advanced study,
creativity and production in
DBCERD; it is clear, when we look
at the record of the DBCERD
faculty that an intense personal and P
collective self-development is be-
ing undergone by this faculty and
has been from the inception of the
department. It is the task of Black
Studies, and any developing entity,
to train its adherents. This
increases the importance for
graduate study, tenured faculty
professional and programmatic
development in the DBCERD at
Pitt. . ‘

So that the issue, contrary to the
mamier in which it is reported,‘ is
not a question of disagreement but
rather whether or not such
professional development is occur-

ing in DBCERD, and what is
acceptable pi'ofessional develop-
ment in DBCERD. And this is

primarily a question for DBCERD
Factiltv as a collective.

What is clear, even at this point.
is that some members of the
departnieiit in their respective
ﬁelds have surpassed the PhD level

of performance._ This should be

\

X.

 

expected, given that the PhD is
considered an entry-level degree
according to the Faculty Handbook
at Pitt, and many (most) of our
faculty have been long engaged in
productive endeavor long past the
entry level.

My reason for writing this letter
is to clarify my response to the
interview conducted by Ed Hollin.
My feeling about other issues is
that they will be -properly clarified
as a matter of
response by the faculty of the
DBCERD. Such questions as the
relative security of the. faculty
individually and collectively, the
nature of community relevant
education, faddism etc. have not
been unrelated to other such issues
as promotion and tenure guide-
lines, programmatic development,
curriculum development and all

’ other normal cares of an academic

department and these continue to
be handled efficiently by the
appropriate faculty-designated
bodies in the department. Likewise
where Black Studies veers from the
considered ‘normal’ academic con-
ditions, this faculty has made and
continues to make practice speak
where precedence does not.

...And the Pitt News is not
Newsweek, nor is it the New York
Times. consequently, the odd-fish

_' which flow in and out of the fish

bowl _are likely to ,be of lesser
significance though they go for the
same bait. At the same time this is
where it’s at for DBCERD and
while foul winds blow across the
nation in terms of Black Studies’
probable fate we remain profes-
sionally confident and committed to
the further development of a
ma_ior-model of Black Studies
structure and function in the
nation. We should move with
precision.

And for that we rely, to some

extent. on accurate repeating and '

constructive iournalisni. The
article “Black Studies: Out of
Crisis-into Maturity—-A New Gen-
eration Coming," is not that.

Though it has a creative title, and
we. in Black Studies, would love to
see a new generation in the form of
additional faculty appointment.
complete with new money straight
from the Dean of FAS's good
hands; we have to deal with the fact
that those of us interviewed are a
lot older than any new generation

‘urban planning. V
SWPRPC are the barrier between

institutional -

issue of expansion versus the man
in the street.

All cities are facing a need for
redirection of their growth pat-
terns. There is an undeniable
urgency to stabilize the core of any

‘community to guard against urban

blight and decay.

The agencies which plan this new
growth. the commissions providing
the solutions. must also take into
account the human cost of such

proiects, independent of the dollar

and cents ﬁgures of computers.

The city has a responsibility to the
commuter as a taxpayer to provide
services.’ The question is whether
or not the people within the city
must be expected to pay the
physical and social costs of
expanded highway systems to
provide for the surburban com-
muters’ convenience. .

Where is this city going? From
city to suburb to exurb? And most
importantly, what facts are deci-
ding transit solutions proposed by
urban planners?

This is not a denouncenfent of
Agencies like

our society and the pressing
demands of the future. They serve
a critical need for conscious control

. of urban growth.

The grim necessities of urban
renewal, highway expansion and
public planning will always exact a
human cost. It is unavoidable
The only other option to planning
within our metropolitan areas is
chaotic urban sprawl.

It is too easy, however, for men
working in the realm of survey
ﬁgures andicost-benefit ratios to
forget the actual human cost of
inner city proiects.

The impact of highways such as
the Oakland Crosstown Express-
way extend far beyond the mere
strip of landiwhich has to be
purchased.

The SWPRPC has ‘assured us,

every possible ramification of such

a massive construction plan has

been assessed, or at least every
reasonable ramification. But’,
what is reasonable and why is it
reasonable? I

The socio-economic language of
the urban planner cannot [comfort
the person losing a home or
business. Computer graphics and
long range extrapolations did not
help the people in East Street who
were ‘killed in fires or killed
themselves.

The alternatives to the Oakland
Crosstown Expressway must be
made clear to the people involved.

The balance between growth and
stability is not an easy one to ﬁnd.
No one can ask the SWPRPC to pull
it out of a hat. Planners in that
agency, however. should remind
themselves real people are in-
volved, not iust the '“residencies"
eupheniistically mentioned in the
SWPRPC reports.

Before they invoke the power of
public domain, it is. the responsi-
bility of the SWPRPC to make it
clear to the people of this
community that the costs of this
program will be worth the suffering
it will cause.‘

April Fools

Dear Editor:

May lcompliment you for your
April Fool's (April 1) issue of the
Pitt News.

It was one of the most repulsive
literary fiascos I've ever seen put
out by the Pitt News. First. by
insulting and Islandering Chan-
cellor Wesley Posvar and Mr.
Dutton to boot. you possibly have
opened yourselves to at least a
great deal of disrespect. if not a
couple of court suits.

I am sick and tired of seeing these
nudie pictures; one would think the
photographers have something
better to do than take skin flicks.

Come on! You're not a porno mag?

Or, are you?

Your little piece entitled “Swap
Senorita" insults the intelligence
and the good taste of the Pitt
academic community.

However, your greatest triumph
came from the so-called Lois Lane
personna. who drummed up a piece
so scintillatingly vomitus and
damnably blasphemous by doing a
take-off on Bill Cosby's version of
Noah and the Ark. That anyone
would insult the divinity of the
supreme—deity concept. Iyvhether
they believe in God or not, in the

bacchanalian caricature of some
foul-mouthed monstrosity-—a con-
coction of some Nietzschean
imagination gone pervertedly
mad--strikes me as the epitome of
illiterate barbarianism. And. this
takes the cake as far as The Pitt
News having lost its aesthetic
sensibilities. amply well-demon-
strated in this past issue. As far as
I am concerned. whoever “Lois
Lane" is should either shape up or
ship out in one heck of a hurry.
As far as I can perceive, the
writers of The‘ Pitt News must
possess much. much more poten-
tial than they showed in this past
issue. If they expect to be t’op-
flight iournalists. let them be
advised to start writing like adults

‘BY LARRY PANSINO
Despite the administration's
ublic relations commitment to
.1tt_?s ‘relevancy as an urban
ampus, the urban studies major is
being stifled in its attempts to grow
nto’ what its teachers say would be
(only an “academically sound
‘ "program. ‘ ’
' Urban studies instructors re-
ntly made a budget proposal to
Faculty of Arts and Science's [FAS]
Dean Jerome L. Rosenberg. It
requested a senior faculty member
direct the major, that a full-time
advisor ’be appointed, and in-
. creased faculty time from academic
"  departments. .
' FAS granted only theacademic
advisor. Teachers and students in

the major feel a director is
necessary to lend coherence to the
program; more faculty time would
enable more courses to be offered

Presently, courses required for
the ma_jor are offered only
"sporadically, which students ma-
joring in urban studies complain
gives no continuity to the program.
-Rosenberg says.it is up to the
{faculty to push for any academic
‘program and senior faculty are
more interested in preserving their
more traditional disciplines.
_ “The major needs programmatic
support from senior faculty and
their involvement in it,” the Dean
- explained. “There must be more
i j evidence of this interest before we
. _ can make available relevant faculty
[for teaching...Until senior faculty
‘_gets involved, the program won't
be strengthened.” _
Samuel P. Hays, history ‘profes-
ssor with urban studies interests
and a senior faculty member. gave
his views. “The number of senior
faculty who are seriously interested
in urban studies is relatively small.
__ “Those that are interested have
_  other. commitments and don't have
 time. For . example, they must
supervise graduate students be-
sides teach their normal load of
courses.”

Hays said junior faculty, who are
less influential in academic de-
cision-making and comprise all but
one of the teachers in urban
studies, are probably more in-
tensely interested in the program
.9 because of their graduate training
in similar pursuits.

stronger interests in more estab-
lished courses. Hays said he ‘would
enjoy teaching. ‘an urban history
course if he had the time.

In response to a question about a‘
change in FAS policy if the urban
studies teachers were senior, Hays
remarked, “Sure there would be a
Senior faculty have
experience, they've been around
longer. The administration realizes
you’ll carry through with programs
because you have a permanent
commitment to the University.
Junior faculty are more apt to leave
for another position."

Hays said there is a tendency to
blame individual departments for
stifling of the program. “In this
case, the administration is showing

a lack of initiative for failing to take
responsibility for the situation,” he

observed. “The interested stu-
dents and faculty are there. We
need a device to make the

administration see the need and
provide for this program.

“The University is making its
urbantcommitment in word only.
The administration says we're an
urban university and then they

’ don’t follow through with a real

commitment."

But Rosenberg explained the
tight budget situation and how it
affects hard decisions. “Now
we're at a ZPG (zero population
growth) situation, (in what is
offered). We can't afford luxuries
and have to look for what we can
eliminate. The faculty has to be
forced to make some of the
decisions... , R

“The faculty has to run it (urban
-studies). The faculty has to make
_judgements...The people who are
interested in it have to convince
.their colleagues of its worth," the
Dean concluded. ’

Dr. Raymond E. Owen of the
political science department, who
teaches_urban studies courses,
realizes the constraining ﬁnancial
situation that prevents granting
faculty time. When a department
gives time to one of its teachers to
teach in an interdepartmental
major like urban studies, it must
either eliminate the course he had
previously taught or hire an
instructor to replace him, an
additional expenditure. A

But Owen believes the present
‘program is deficient. it “I don’t

urban studies majors. It's nothing

the moment," he said.

When asked to" respond to
rumors that the recent budget
proposal cuts by FAS would -

endanger the program’s future
existence, Owen said, “There’s
more than a’ possibility it [urban
studies] will end. The thing is
dying. We’ll finish out the
students that are in it but not
continue with it. It would be
unethical to continue...It would be
unfair to students to continue in
this way.”

Owen pointed out that the major
has no ’records, no office, no
clerical facilities. It operates out of
the ofﬁces of the instructors who
teach it.

Besides Owen, other teachers
currently working in urban studies
are the program’s chairman,

ment), Philip H. Vernon (geog-

These instructors teach urban

department structure has led to_

many of the program’s difﬁculties
in getting budget support.

Glazer explained that the major,
which is more or less run by the
instructors who teach it, does not
control, its component courses,
which are under the direction of
individual departments that spon-
sor them. These courses are even
listed in time schedules under their
departments, which makes it
confusing for majors to plan their
curricula.

According to the College of Arts
and Sciences bulletin, the urban
studies major consists of three
componentsrsix to nine credits of
basic introductory social science
courses, 15 to 1,8 ‘ credits of
‘I00-level courses with urban
emphasis, and at least 12 credits of

nars, field study, and special,urban

Besides the scarcity of 100-level

Yet despite these problems and
attempts by instructors to dis-
courage students from choosing
this major, urban studies has

. grown steadily since its conception

 

in the fall of 1969. According to
FAS figures, the major has
expanded in numbers of primary
majors from 12 in October of 1970
to 50 last October.

Glazer explains that urban studies

majors have “a very strong interest V

commitment to deal with urban‘

problems.” V

One senior urban studies major,
Tom Mauser, said he felt his major
has “practical applications" that
other majors couldn't offer. “I was
in political science for’three years
and I felt it wasn't getting me
anywhere. It's all theory," Mauser
said.

Mauser’s career interests lie in
working for an urban agency. .He
believes the interdisciplinary na-
ture of the major and the field
experience gotten from the CA5 25

-internship course were advan-V_'-

tageous. . ,

“I was attracted to the program
to get credits for working in city
agencies,” Mauser observed.
“There are a helluva lot of
opportunities in the whole urban
field.”

Higgins’ 'Cogan’s Trade’ Recreates

The World of Small Time Crime

BY HARRIS LEVY
COGAN’S TRADE
By George V. Higgins 216 pp.
New York: Alfred A. Knopf !5.95

George V. Higgins’ latest novel
Cogan’s Trade is unusually good
crime fiction. Cogan’s Trade, from
the man who gave you The Friends
of Eddie Coyle (1972) and The
Digger’s Game (1973), describes
the criminal underworld with
amazing authenticity.

'Cogan's Trade, like its two
predecessors, is set in the Boston
area. Also similar to Higgins’
other books is the novel’s style:
long passages of marvelously
authentic-sounding dialogue inter-
spersed with terse descriptions of
settings and actions. Higgins
superficially describes a charac-
ter’s appearance; the reader learns
what a character’s personality is
like from what he says. -

This book is concerned with the

9‘ life of smalltime thugs. Men who
steal dogs in‘ Massachusetts‘ and
sell them in Florida. A man ‘iust
out of iail with nowhere to work. A
killer from New York who used to
be good,/worthless now. Long-suf-
fering wives fed up with their
husbands‘ criminal activities and
iail terms. Betting on card games.
Bettingon horse races. Betting on

hockey games; _ A _ '

Mark Trattman runs a big-money

card game with the approval of the
New England mob. Four years
ago. Trattman hired someone to
hold up his own card games: he
split over $50,000 with his
accomplices.

John (the Squirrel) Amato‘iusti

ﬁnished serving six years in iail for
a bank robbery. He runs a driving
lessons school and has a big
gambling habit. Amato figures
that by holding up Trattman's card
game he can get a lot of money. He
can't do it himself because
Trattman would recognize him. He
looks up Frankie, who also served
time on the bank robbery. Frankie
brings in Russell. who is looking for
more money to buy and deal drugs.
$l2.000 worth.

Frankie and Russell, wearing
masks, successfully hold up Tratt-
man’s card game and split nearly
$100,000 with the Squirrel. \Other
card games-close down because the
people who run them are afraid
Mob leaders figure this is bad for
business.

Enter Jackie Cogan. Cogan's
trade is enforcing. It is his
responsibility to deal with the

people who held up Trattman's
game. ' The first possibility is
Trattman himself. Cogan hires two
thugs to beat Trattman up; even
after the brutal beating Trattman
pleads innocence.

After careful analysis,

Cogan

figures out who held up the game.
Meanwhile. Amato and his side-
kicks expect retribution. Cogan
ruthlessly deals with the offenders
and the book reaches a violent.
vividly described climax. Unex-
pected violence also ensues (those
of you iust looking for the good
parts will find this on page 212).
Higgins’ ability to write dialogue
is unsurpassed. Here for example
is part of Amato’s description of
Trattman. _\/
"...All theguys like Markie.
He's a genuine hot shit. _And look
when they find out; when every-'
body's open again. .They'd've
found out it was him when the
games're all closed and every-
body's hearing footsteps and
nobody's making any money.
them, I think. they would've done it
to him. But they didn't. And then,
when they did, well what the fuck

and iust as long as it doesn't
happen again. because ‘all the
customers. you're not gonna get
them coming in unless they think
it's protected, out the protection’s
really there, well, shit on it."
Many chapters are almost

exclusively dialogue threaded to-.

OK folks. Everybody’s been
asking, “Where’s the David
Crosby review?” and I've been
postponing it (I never knew my
ellipses were so popular), so I

hear, “Hey, I thought that clown

who liked David Crosby so much
would have a raving review on the
concert!" And all the devotees of

 _ tender hearted David are probably

asking the same.

To tell you the truth I’ve seen
better shows before and for that

ll Tonight at Carnegie Hall

Grauer: Musical Filmmaker For Real

BY ED TOWNSEND
Hey, did you hear the one about
the filmmaker who’s really :1
‘composer? -

Yeah, and he says that film isn't
a visual medium,« and he's
attempting to destroy the concept
ofa ﬁlm's frame, and that for art to
advance, culture best go back-
wards, and last of all. if you're after
rhythm, you buy a ml] of film and
not a set of drums.

Strange indeed, until you talk

with this rhythmic filmmaker‘

character, Dr. Victory Grauer. The
ex-Pitt faculty member sort of
disappointed me at first. Dressed
like a non-commuting slob Pitt
student, beard included, I expected
the slow-speaking, tender-voiced
man to be pseudo-artist number 53
I’ve met this year. You know, the
seven-pack-a-day smoker, revolu-
tion promoter, confident and
God-like, nobody’s-right-but-me

- sort of deal--the kind that are great

to laugh at. .

But Grauer wasn't looking for
something cute to do, and he knows
his attempts aren't always an-
swers. Instead, his musical
interests sensibly led him to film
and at the moment, his works are
more investigative possibilities
than self-declared answers.

Grauer is basically a composer,
but while looking for a form that
offered the greatest possibility for
perfect rhythm, he skipped over
electronic-music and -found ‘the
set-frames per second that film
offers. ' " '

Grauer's films are of several
types. His first three ﬁlms--Angel
Eyes (1965), Archangel. (most

successful and shown at the 1966’
New

York’ Film Festival), and

Seraph--consisted
pure colored frames. No images.
simply the rythmic use of solid
color. The films are a hearing
sensation, not a ‘Windy' burning-
of-Atlanta experience.

Next, Grauer made two films--
Certain Stars and Distant Star--in
which he used an incising
[scratching] method. The method
is a spontaneous scratching of

opaque film such that when shown,

the projected light is that of the
scratch marks. Grauer likes to

compare this method to Jackson
Pollock’s action painting--a com-
munication of spontaneous feeling.

Both ‘star’ films are projected on to
a screen box--a form that elimin-
ates the square-like picture frame
projection typically seen.

In Acid, Grauer used a cloraér
bleaching method and again, he
proiects this one on a screen box.

Grauer, like many, believes that
film is a medium of the dream
image. But not like many, he
believes that the dream-fantasy
aspect of ﬁlm is dangerous--people
of today get lost or lose touch with
reality through their Archie Bunk-
er, Robert Redford, and Raquel
Welch fantasies. Grauer’s ﬁlms
attempt to change this destructive
idea. His ﬁlms are real, musical
(they remain abstract), and many
have no soundtrack--the music is
within -the film itself. I
I These attempts sound and seem
artistic, aesthetic and crapless but
this guy seemed too for real.
“Really, why do your ‘films this
way, in these methods?”

“I’m broke, I refuse to play the
tenure-professor game and I can’t
think of any filming‘ technique
that’s cheaper than scratching film.

book sto_re] which I had published
on one sheet of paper. Of course,
you need a magnifying glass to
read it, but it was indeed, cheap.”

But there really is much more to
his film techniques and his book
than economics. It’s all a matter of
breaking down frames, creating a
total experience, a "happening."
Like Ann Halprin?—-no, since many
of her “happening" attempts are
geared to the breakdown of the
imaginary line between art and life
whereas Grauer feels himself
pulling together the different art
forms.

“In a primitive manner,” he
continually says, “in primitive
civilizations there’s no specializa-
tion in the arts, no limiting
functions to the artist. Therefore‘
what I consider a “happening” is
the creation of a totally artistic
environment. No specific frames,
no limitations, a mixture of dance,
music, theatrics, and film. Art to
me is power--a manifesting,
creating, whatever spiritual power.
There’s no purpose in limiting this
power to a viewing or a specific
form.”

What now? Well, to eliminate
any possible Pitt-Pittsburgh bore-
dom, one m_ight seriously consider
attending “Beyond the Frame,”
the title of Grauer's show (not a
“happening"), which will be held
in Carnegie Institute tonight, April
3, at 8:30 pm.

Grauer maintains that the fastest
form of travel is “the dream.” If
you catch the show (which consists
of many of the above mentioned
ﬁlms). I’m sure you’ll enjoy the
trip. Dream on.

Buckle Up, Musketeers Return

BY M.C. PILECKI

Alexandre Dumas wrote more
than iust an historical novel when
he penned The Three Musketeers
over a Century ago.

His tale of 18th century French
court intrigue, spiced with gallan-
try and adventure, has been
adapted for the screen so many
times that D’Artagnan and com-

use of “said" but actually it is

 suitably unobtrusive.

More than in his other novels;
Higgins’ characters’ conversations
are digressive. Readers might
ob_iect when a character strays from
the main topic or when events
become confusing. By describing
their daily lives through the
digressive conversation, Higgins
presents more credible and well-
rounded characterizations.

To this reader, the effect of the
slight confusion and digressions is
to increase the realism.

In non-dialogue passages, Hig-
gins uses crisp, terse descriptions.
An excerpt from one of the violent
scenes should "demonstrate that:

“...He hit Trattman very hard,
twice, in the pit of the stomach.
Trattman started to double over’
with the impact of the first punch.
The second brought: a rush of air

front of Grauman’s Chinese Thea-
tre. ’

The story first hit the flicks in
Edison's silent version in 1911. and
since then the protagonists have
been portrayed by everyone from
Douglas Fairbanks to Don Ameche
and the Ritz Brothers (really). In
recent years, however, the swash-

Trattman fell forward on the
pavement and. vomited half-di-
gested_ steak and salad, and blood.

He lay on his chest, his head
resting on its left side. He
breathed noisily."

Cogan’s Trade blends functional
description and flavorful dialogue
with an exciting, interesting story.
This fast-paced, suspenseful book
gives readers a.thorough picture of
how criminals operate. In this
novel, unlike Higgins’ other‘-books,
justice is administered by other
criminals. This reﬂects the ethics
of a group where one must either
kill one's partner or die.
third fine book should please crime

novel readers. Its superior quality,

which" is the result of its realism,
makes it worth the attention of all
readers. Higgins ‘makes the reader
an offer he‘can’t refuse.

Higgins’ '

bucklers have fallen by the
wayside, victims probably of high

nproduction costs and a so-called

“new sophistication" in movies.

And movie fans were poorer for
the loss. Those swashbucklers
were flicks at their most escapist:
lavish costumes, unbelievable
stunts, dashing characters and a
simple plot that didn't interfere
with the story.

Well, after suffering through
innumerable violent modern cop
ﬂicks, uncountable sophisticated
modern love stories, and unend-
able modern fad films of devils,
drugs and other dredges of society,
it’s nice to get back to good
old-fashioned entertainment. The
latest edition ‘of The Three
Musketeers has absolutely no
redeeming social value, no mes-

sage and no conscience, just two

hours of mindless fun.

The story is still toned down from
the original, but has more of a
flavor of Richelieu France. The
luxurious decadence of the mon-
archy in spectacular sets and
extravagant costumes is contrasted
to the poor's tattered clothes and
ﬁlthy surroundings. But the
comparison is less to provide a
“social comment" than to fill in a
rich tapestry of historical color.

Films are no longer as sexually
stifled as they were back in
Douglas Fairbanks‘ day, so the
current Musketeers can bring more

of the ribald texture of the times.

Still, the movie's PG rating
(making it suitable for the Saturday
matinee pre-puberty set) inhibits it
from being as free as it could be.

The story has lost little in its
transition to the 70’s. The dueling
scenes are well staged and
executed with suitable flourish
(which proves that violence expert-
ly choreographed will suitably
appease the most bloodthirsty
pacifist).

One problem is with the
characters. Predictably, they’re all
rather "flat and show nothing
beneath beautiful veneers. But for
some reason, perhaps to make the
film more 'humorous and less
“camp," several are inordinately
clumsy, particularly Constance
[Racquel Welch] and D’Artagnan
[Michael York]. This awkwardness
adds nothing to the story but a few
unjustifiable embarrassing mo-
ments. Another sore point is the

three musketeers themselves are
given so little to do, and rarely get
the opportunity to dash about with
the expected swash and buckle.

All the adiectives promotion
people use, like “spectacular,"
“lavish," “extravagant" and other
superlatives certainly apply to this
flick.
cast. the main stars are the often
breathtaking costumes and sets
which overshadow any shadows of
quaintness or naivete.

The Three Musketeers is cer-
tainly needed to rescue one fair
damsel--the movie—going public--
from a recent dearth of “good fun”
in flicks. Unfortunately. one can
already envision countless others
iumping on the successful band-
wagon. A sequel to this flick is
already in production, and a wave
of swashbucklers is probably on the
way.

Sure. The Three Musketeers is a
fun ﬂick. but in this case, once is
quite enough. '

‘BY M.C. PILECKI

Never let it be confused that film
and theatre are the same medium.
The former shows its story. in

A _'visual images. the latter tells its
V story in a dramatic way.

This difference is what makes
film. The term “moving pictures”

_ may sound quaint. but it's a highly

accurate description of a primarily
visual art. On the stage the story is
told in words--long soliloquies,
extended dialogue, narration. In
film the story is not so much .told in
words as in a relating of cinematic
images. '

When film was born. there was
no sound. and silent movies of
necessity had to rely totally on
images. thus a new art form was
created. But when sound was
introduced. inexperienced (incom-
petent. may sound too harsh)

directors lost their grasp of visuals
and began to photograph pictures
of people talking.

the flick seems much better suited
to the stage. Actually. with very
little work on an adaptation. the
screenplay would make a very nice
play. It's already neatly divided
into three separate acts: Gid
telling about the 20’s. Molly the
40's and Johnny the 60's. Also
most of the film's action is limited
to a repetition of sets. primarily
indoors.

And the way that minor
characters are so abruptly dropped
lnone survives the first act], but are
kept in the story only in the spoken
narration and dialogue, remind one
again of the theatre. And time is
not as expansive and smooth as is
usual in film. Each act comprises
at most a year, and then jumps to
the next act 20 years later. What
happens in between is again
discussed in the dialogue.

These two habits are rather
disconcerting to the movie-goer
who islflung from era to era. trying

to ﬁgure out whatever happened to

Gid's wife or Molly's husband
(right--the two lovers never are
married to each other). And the

CHILDREN’S THEATRE
Childsplay, the University of

theatre company. will return to the
Oakland campus for three perfor-
mances of Everykid on’ Saturday
April 6, at 11am and 1 pm and
Sunday April 7 at 2 pm in the

from ages six to ten. Written and
directed by Dr. Gillette Elvgren,
assistant professor of theatre arts,
the play follows the characters,

demnation or the libertine’s praise.

The second act, when the film":
takes Molly’s_ point of view, delves

into the character past the male
fantasies and the romanticism
stereotypically associated with the
sexually free woman [a la Meline
Mercouri in Never On Sunday].
Molly realizes and willingly accepts
the pain of determining her own
strong personality, disregarding
the poisoned barbs society hurls
her way. However, expressing this
through spoken reminisces and old
letters is far less’ effective than
showing Molly suffering the pain at
its source.

Acting iobs are, as expected, up
to par from all three principals, an
important consideration with the
flood of dialogue. Danner, Perkins

V and Bridges leave no gaps in ﬁlling

the second two acts (when they are
the only characters), and are strong
enough to- carry the film.

It's a nice enough little film that
manages to absorb the audience
into the lives of its characters. But
if Lovin’ Molly had been construc-
ted with a better eye for the
camera. it may have been more

I can attribute my own reactions

feelings about,Arena crowds which
are predominately a younger high
school bunch--that doesn’t iustify
their actions but explains them.
With this crowd last Saturday
one must assume there’s a higher
maturity level than at the Arena,

I found it difﬁcult to hear him
talk between songs with cries for
old and obscure Byrd tunes.‘ Up in
Edinboro he did a couple, but the
crowd he was playing to was nicer
and this crowd was ignorant, so I
can understand why David didn't
play some of the tunes “re-
quested." Maybe from now on we

l)or.sett Not Alone In

BY YAIER LEHRER
Whenever someone mentions

. the Pitt backfield. the name Tony

Dorsett inevitably arises. After all.
the All-American freshman run-
ning back helped turn around an
entire football program. When
next season rolls around. though.
it's quite possible that name like
Curtis Smith. Melvin Howard. Alan

Webster. and Bob ’Hutton will be ‘

sharing what has been primarily
Dorsett's personal limelight.

"There's a lot of competition for
positions in the backfield." said
offensive backfield coach Harry
Jones. “We're going to have to
choose from a number of good
runners. lt's the kind of problem
you like to have."

Curtis Smith. for instance. is
making a strong bid for the number
one fullback position while Dave
Janasek 'sits out spring drills
recovering from wrist surgery.
Smith. a 205 pound back. saw
enough action to earn a varsity
letter last season.

“Curtis has worked very hard in
the off-season.” says Jones. “and
we feel that this has helped him
improve and could account for the
good grading he has been getting
in scrimmage."‘.'*}

Bob Hutton. a freshman full-
back. has also shown a lot of
promise. but will have to wait until
after spring drills to come to the

Until the surgery. though. Hutton
and Smith had been consistently
grading higher than the others
vying for the same position.

Both Melvin Howard and Alan
Webster have slight problems.
They're hallbacks. and everyone
knows who Pitt's halfback is. The
coaches have another problem. .
Both Howard and Webster are too
good to sit on anybody's bench.

Webster. a 180 pound transfer
from Waco. Texas was a three-let-
terman--baseball. track. and foot-
ball at Gary Burley’s former school.
Wharton Junior College. He and

Howard, a transfer from Texas‘

Tech. who sat out last year at Pitt
so he could be eligible next season.

will be converted into wingbacks. "

“We will try to establish a very
balanced attack next season." said
Coach Jones. "and because of that
we will be using a good number of
formations in which the wingbacks
and tailbacks will be very impor-
tant. We'll try to throw a little
more to the backs. and since
Webster and Howard are both good
receivers as well as good runners.
it should work out."

The coaching staff is well aware
they are only in spring drills. and
because of that do not want to
proiect too far ahead to the regular
season. But one thing is for sure. a
couple of hard decisions are going
to have to be mad_e. When you

STATE COLLEGE. Pa. AP--

Penn State's football team begins

says the team needs a lot of work.

"We really have to have a good

needs a lot of work," Paterno said.

Six Penn State offensive starters

National Football League draft.

John Cappelletti. a running back

outstanding offensive player in the
Lions‘ Orange Bowl victory over

Senior Tom Donchez, who saw
considerable action behind the

detection «to the World Football
League could be immediate.

his team into a close. family-type

helping them with National Foot-

ball League titles the past two
years.
After the signing of Csonka,

Kiick and Warfield by Toronto of
the WFL, Shula himself admits he
doesn't know what attitude will
_ ._y prevail when training camp begins
this July.

I. “I certainly hope not,” said
Shula when asked Monday whether
[animosity might develop between
players, coaches and club officials.

‘camp, put the best players together
and try to win the Super Bowl

Shula said he was misquoted
A Sunday as saying he might not

Warﬁeld this season.

“I've never been confronted
with this situation before." he said.

“Our whole goal is to go back to .

7?:

  

"I heard Csonka said they
intended to honor their commit-
ment and it was the responsibility
of the club ‘to live up to its
commitment."

Csonka said, “We intend to give
the Miami fans 100 per cent effort
this season, so I assume they'll
hold no grudges against us.”

, Shula's problem is if he plays the
trio this year in hopes of
recapturing the Super Bowl. he'll
face a maior rebuilding iob in 1975.
The alternative is to begin
rebuilding now with new players.

But that would require maior
changes in offensive strategy,
which has been built around the
bull-like rushes of fullback Csonka
with Mercury Morris and Warfield
keeping defenses honest with
outside runs and pass patterns.

Don Nottingham was acquired
last year from Baltimore where he
started, but at 5-foot-10 and 210
pounds, he could hardly be
expected to provide the durability
or the power which made Csonka’s
line charges so threatening.

Csonka is a 6-2, 237 pound bomb
aimed at the line about 16 times a
game. He has gained over 1,000

You are sitting among 3,000
screaming fans, all gazing in glee
at the oval track below where ten
women are punching .each other.

Although the fighting has
erupted at regular intervals dozens
of times in the past two hours. the
scraggly gray-haired woman in the
next seat is screaming with the

-. same hysteria. Her hair, once-tied

neatly in a bun. now clings in wet
strands to her sweaty cheeks and
her rolled stockings have failed
from her quivering knees to her
ankles.

The old woman springs from her
seat for the umpteenth time.
swinging heribony fists through the
air with each uppercut thrown on
the track below. Somehow one of
her filinging. targetless blows goes
astray and you are holding your
painful shoulder. reaclling the
madness of the evening with
amazement.

You see, this is your first trip to
the Roller Derby.

Last Friday the Roller Derby, or
Roller Games as it is now called,
rolled into the Civic Arena as the
New York Chiefs and Philadelphia
Warrior-Cats clashed before‘ a
small crowdiof 3.000. They were
noisier than a packed house of
Penguin fans.

_ The skating, the blocking, the
scoring, and the success or failure
of either team was of little
importance to the fans. They sat
patiently in their seats waiting for

’ the ‘fiam" perio-d to end and for the -

more than teams.

fans. Fan interest in the Roller
Games. more than any other team
sport. centers around personalities
There is a
hero--villain syndrome resembling
professional wrestling.

In the Chief's ‘corner’ was “Big
Chief" John Parker. a 260 pound
Cherokee Indian and one of Roller
Ganies' biggest crowd pleasers.
Parker squared off several time
with the Warriors equally robust
Buddy Atkinson.

Early in the game Parker was
shoved into the padded wooden rail
which was originally intended to
keep the skaters on the track. The
rail broke under Parker’s weight
and_while it was being repaired the
fans were becoming restless.
Sensing this, Parker and Atkinson
began gesturing to each other. The
old woman, anticipating what was
to follow, rose from her seat,
shouting obscenities at Parker.

brawling began. The anger was
feigned, the punches were pulled,
and the knees didn’t really drive
into the gut but the fans loved
every bit of it.

The crowd was split evenly
between Chief fans and Warrior

With two deflecting‘
elbows to the chest and the usual
air punch, which came within
inches of striking Trotter's square
chin, the Warrior was disposed of.
