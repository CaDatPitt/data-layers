Union workers and Pitt
disagree on contracts

Zachariah Blott

News Editor

By next week, the University could resemble
a giant landfill.

About 60 janitors, groundskeepers and main-
tenance workers demonstrated with signs and
chants while zig-zagging around campus
Wednesday afternoon to demand a 3—percent pay
increase and health benefits.

“People united will never be defeated!” they
yelled in unison on their walk past the student
union and Hillman Library.

According to Billy Jordan, president of AFL-
CIO Lgcal 29, which supplies union workers to

-»..-.t= ‘University, he’ll meet with University offi-

cials at 10:30 a.m. on Thursday to discuss a new
contract for the members. The workers have
been working under the old contract since Jan. 1,
1996, when it expired.

“They haven’t moved [with the wages] since
last week [when Local 29 demonstrated during
the Freshman Fair],” said Jordan. “We’ll strike if
we need to.”

Local 29 supplies 362 workers to Pitt, and if
Jordan doesn’t feel any progress is made
between the union and the University on
Thursday morning, the workers could strike.

“It would be devastating,” Jordan said, when
asked about the impact of every janitor and
maintenance worker striking.

Walter Naence, a maintenance worker at Pitt,
said he was angered that Pitt wouldn’t budge at
paying the workers 3 percent more.

“We want 3 percent, but they won’t move,”
he said. “They only want to give us 2 percent.”

Naence also expressed concern about health

benefits.

“We want them to pay for our hospital [ben-
efits], also,” he added.

Jordan said the University has the money in
its budget to give the workers a 3—percent raise
but that Pitt continues to offer a 2-percent
increase.

How likely are the workers to strike if Pitt
and Local 29 don’t see eye to eye on Thursday
morning?

“We will [strike] if we have to,” Jordan said.

“The people are ready to move.”

Walter Moorefield, a maintenance worker
with 20 years‘ service at Pitt, says the University
doesn't care about its workers. “I feel like we’re
not even getting fair wages,” he said. “We’ll
keep rallying until they wake up and notice.”

Workers weren’t the only ones demonstrating
Wednesday. A dozen or so Pitt students joined
the workers in shouting and carrying signs

For The Pitt News

Students who work at min-
imum-wage jobs and are trying
to pay for college or just trying
to make some extra money are
getting a bigger paycheck
these days thanks to the
increase in the minimum wage.

On Sept. 1, the second of
two recent minimum—wage
increases went into effect, rais-
ing the rate from $4.75 an hour
to $5.15. The first increase
went into effect on Oct. 1,
1996, raising the wage from

$4.25 to $4.75.

Even though the wage
increase went into effect just
two weeks ago, many mini-
mum-wage workers had
already received increases in
their salaries.

"We gave them [the
employees] raises before the
minimum wage took effect.
Some -people got raises six,
eight months ago," said
Christine L. Bryan, the market-
ing director for Bruegger's
Bagels.

Restaurants and stores in

Oakland are using a variety of
methods to deal with the high-
er salaries they must pay their
workers. Many of the larger
franchise establishments, such
as McDonald's and Bruegger's,
have decided to absorb the cost
of paying higher salaries with-
out raising prices or trimming
their work force.

Other establishments have
not yet taken any measures to
offset the higher salaries but
are considering raising prices
or reconsidering what they
expect from their employees.

"No, we haven't raised the
prices, but we probably will,”
said Judy O'Connor, owner of
Bobby O's. “We might have
to."

Senior Greg Camphire
views even the small increase
in the hourly wage as a reason
to be happy.

"People that work 40 hours
a week, it all adds up. More
money is definitely good!" said
Camphire.

Even though the majority
of students see no problem in

New mall bus routes give students free rides

Lisa Grzyboski
Senior Staff Writer

Beginning this Saturday,
Pitt students will be able to
experience the sights, sounds,
smells and shopping of area
malls.

And it will all be free of
charge with a Pitt ID.

Pittsburgh's Port
Authority, which oversees
public bus transportation in
and around the city, recently
added two new routes in
Oakland that will make it sub-
stantially easier for students
and residents to visit the
Century III and Ross Park
Malls.

Instead of students having
to ride a bus downtown, pur-
chase a transfer and hurry to
catch an outgoing bus to one

heading toward the Boulevard
of the Allies and the city.

Students can expect a
30—rriinute trip, said Aggazio,
once the new route begins.

Pitt parking and trans-
portation officials will release
the Ross Park Mall schedule
times closer to the Oct. 4 start-
ing date.

PAT offrcials added new

overwhelming popularity of last
year's carnpus-mall shuttles.
Toward the end of

February, Pitt's Student
Government Board, in conjunc-
tion with A the campus

of the suburban malls, they can now hop
on a bus in front of the Wﬂliarn Pitt Union
to get to the malls.

"For students that may not have
accessjo a car and must rely on public

"transportation, this service will be great
for them," said Donna Aggazio, PAT
spokesperson. "Before, students would
have to transfer in town to get to the
malls, and now they can catch a bus on or
near campus."

Every Saturday, starting this week-
end, students and Oakland residents can
catch the 59U at the student union, along
Bigelow Boulevard, and take it to the
Century III Mall. Another PAT bus will
pass through Squirrel Hill via Forbes and
Murray Avenues, as it continues on its
way to the South Hills Mall.

Students living in Squirrel Hill may
board the buses along these two main
thoroughfares.

"This is a plus for students living in
Squirrel Hill," said John,Morgan, assis-
tant director of transportation at Pitt.
"Now they can catch a mall bus in their
area." i

The first bus will depart Bigelow at
11:30 a.m. Departure times from Pitt will
be every hour at
half past the hour
until 8:30 p.m. The

PAT and Pitt park-

center adjacent to the mall.

\Vithin the Century III Mall, a shop-
per can find a wide variety of smaller
stores that sell clothing, shoes, jewelry,
books and music, along with an assort-
ment of other things, both usual and
unusual. It also houses larger department
stores such as TJ Maxx, Lazarus, Sears,
JC Penney's and Kaufrnarm's.

The nearby shopping center includes
drugstores, card shops, restaurants and an
array of specialty stores.

Buses will begin departing from the
south entrance of the mall at 12:40 p.m.
They will rim every hour at 40 minutes
past the hour until the last bus leaves at
9:40 p.m.

Students carrying a Pitt ID can ride
for free. Guests, family members, non-
Pitt students and area residents must pay
the full fare of $1.60 each way.

Beginning Saturday, Oct. 4, PAT
buses will begin speeding Pitt students
and Oakland residents to the Ross Park
Mall in North Hills.

The l2U bus route that travels to the

[us 510

     
 

Department of Parking and
Transportation, was able to provide sever-

‘ al campus shuttles and drivers to take stu-

dents to local shopping malls.

Several students took advantage of
the weekend shopping excursions, which
prompted the continuation of the service
throughout the remainder of the spring
semester. It also led to the eventual PAT
decision, to add the mall routes to its city
schedule. ‘

" [The shuttle service] was evidently a
tremendous success, and that is why we
wanted to continue it again this year," said
SGB member Marquette Bowman, the
student responsible for getting the mall
shuttle running last semester. "It was a
joint effort by the Port Authority and the

Department I of Parking and

. Transportation at Pitt to make the switch

to city buses. [Parking and transportation
officials] have done a great job in making
sure that the needs of Pitt students are
met."

Because PAT was granted certain
rights by the state to operate city buses, it
felt the Pitt mall shuttles were an infringe-
ment on that right, Morgan said.

As a result, campus ofﬁcials and PAT
officials teamed up to create new routes

Miss America Pageant
allows 2-piece bathing suits

Across the Nation

ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. — If!

you're hoping to see more skin than
talent in this year's Miss America
Pageant, you could be disappoint-
ed.

Pageant officials are allowing
the contestants to wear two-piece
swimsuits for the first, time this
year. However, only 13 of the 51
hopefuls have opted for bel1y-but-
ton baring.

If none of the 13 makes the
final cut, TV viewers will see
essentiallythe same swimsuit com-
petition they have in years past.

If that's not enough ﬂesh,
there's always "Baywatch."

The pageant airs on ABC
Saturday night.

NEW YORK —- Americans‘ atti-
tudes about their money are a little
schizophrenic, according to a new
poll: They're pleased with their sta-
tus, but they worry a lot.

The results come from Money
magazine's 12th ‘ annual
"Americans and Their Money" sur-
vey. E '
Fifty—eight percent report
they're satisfied with their finan-
cial situation. Fifty-seven percent
say they're better off than they

were four years ago. But 59 per-

cent report they often worry about
their money — the highest anxiety
level in four years.

It's the first time in the 12
annual surveys the magazine has
taken that anxiety was found to be
on the rise even though the overall
economy is doing well.

Money also asks each year,
"What do you think about more:
money or sex?" Money always
wins — this year 47 to 19 percent.

CHICAGO — Four employees of

a Chicago child-care center have
been fired for making a video with
sexual overtones in a roomful of
napping children.

' The center's attorney says the
15-minute video, made by two
teachers and two teacher's aides,
includes very brief nudity by one
woman and some sexual banter.

Attorney Don McNeil said the rest
of the tape consists mainly of non-
sexual horseplay and showed no
abuse of any kind.

About 20 children aged three to
five were in the room when the
tape was made. After parents were
told about the tape, some removed
their children from the center.

Police are investigating, and no
charges have been filed.

LOS ANGELES — There was

‘plenty of bodily contact and even

some scoring, but the game in a
Los Angeles-area cable station cer-
tainly wasn't football. ‘

The second half ofthe Cal
State-Northridge — University of
Hawaii game was pre-empted by
the Adam and Eve Channel on the
TC-I East Valley cable system.
Company officials say a computer
automatically switched the pro-
grams at midnight the other night.

A TCI spokesman says the
amazing thing is that nobody called
to complain.

CINCINNATI — Don't have the
heart to hang up on those pesky
telemarketers? Then a Cincinnati
lawyer has just the invention for
you.

Kenneth Jursinski has come up
with the Phone Butler. '

When an unwanted call comes,
all you have to do is press the star
button, and the butler takes over.

The recording, in a gentle-but-
firm voice with a British accent,
says: "Pardon me, this is the Phone
Butler, and I have been directed to
inform you that this household
must respectfully decline your
inquiry. Kindly place this number
on your do-not-call list. Good day."

Even telemarketers like it. An
article in the Effective Telephone
Techniques magazine says it's
quick and somewhat pleasant, so
telemarketers can move on to their
next call without delay.

The Phone Butler costs about
$50 and is sold through Morgan-
Francis, Inc. of Fort Myers, Fla.

WAGE

taking home a bigger paycheck, there
are some who have reservations

about the increase.

"I think it's good and bad.
Raising the wage affects inﬂation,"
said a student who wished not to give

out his name. .

Employers also have their own

opinions about the wage
increase. Because
employees are making
more money, employers
are expecting more pro-
ductivity from them.

"I think you may
see that the employers
are going to expect
more work from their
employees," said Carol
Crum, the owner of
Subway.

As for the
University, the effects
of the increasehave not
been as large as some
might expect, due to the
high demand for
employees. Most
employers were already
paying their workers

above the minimum wage because of
competition among the stores for

part-time and full—time help.

In addition, employers care more
about the abilities of the student
employees than about what the mini-

mum wage is. ‘

She said

FROM PAGE 1

"What can the person do? Can he
do the work of two people?" asked
John Balok, the manager of Miami
Subs.

The University itself has hardly
been affected by the increase. Most
nonstudent employees are covered
by a collective-bargaining agreement
in which wage
increases are handled
independently of the
federal minimum
wage, and most stu-
dent employees were
already making above
the minimum wage.
For example, the only
effect felt by the
University's Food
Services, according to
Andrea Spandonis, a
director at Sodexho,
was that student
employees "now make
$5.15 an hour."
Almost all employ-
ers, whether at the
University or at stores
in Oakland, have been
able to absorb the
increased cost of workers.

.As for student employees’ opin-
ions "of the pay increase, a
McDonald’s employee who wouldn’t
reveal his name may have summed it
up best: "I know how it's affected
me; I'm getting more money!"

STRIKE  

around the campus.

“I heard about what
washappening from my
ﬂoor’s cleaning lady
and thought it was
unfair,” said Nish
Suvarnakar, a sopho-
more who lives in
Sutherland Hall. “I sup-
port them on striking if
the University doesn’t
budge.”

One thing he didn’ t
support, though, was
the use of contract
workers to fill the
union workers’ spots if
the union strikes.

“I wouldn’t appreciate it if

scabs came in,” Suvarnakar said.

FROM PAGE 1

“If they [contract
workers] come in,
watch your shit,” he
said. “They’ll break
in rooms.”

If the University and
Local 29 don’t make
any progress on
Thursday morning,
the workers will hold
another demonstra-
tion in front of the

student union on
Saturday, at a time
not yet set.

Jordan saw some
reason for optimism
in the meeting,
though.

“Hopefully they got some more

A worker who wished not to be on the table to offer,” he said. “And

I think they do.”

THE PITT NEWS A

A New food court in Cathedral

Starbucks and others to replace Roy Rogers

Thad Pawlowski

For The Pitt News

Students trekking
through the Cathedral of
Learning's ground floor will
soon see a food court in
place of Roy Rogers.

The food court is sched-
uled for completion in early
November.

"We're calling it the
Cathedral Cafe for lack of a
better name," said Betsy
Salade-Farina, director of
Food Services at Pitt.

The food court will fea-
ture a Chic Filet, a chain
that specializes in chicken
items and french fries. Also
in the food court, Sodexho,
which replaced Marriott as
Pitt's food—service provider
this summer, will sell deli
sandwiches and gourmet,
char-broiled hamburgers.

"It will most closely
resemble [the] Schenley
[Cafe]  I think it will be a
huge win for students," said
Salade-Farina, citing the.
fact that students will be
able to use Dining Dollars
and CampusFunds at the
food court.

Blocks will not
accepted there, though.

Also planned for the
ground floor of the
Cathedral is a Starbuck's
Cafe, which will be com-
pleted at the end of the
month, according to a repre-
sentative of Tedco
Construction, the contractor
for the project. The
Starbuck's Cafe will sell
coffee, pastries, sandwiches
and salads. It plans to be
open long hours to accom-
modate students who have
night classes at the

be

Cathedral.

Roy Rogers, whose
five—year contract with the
University expired last
year, had no intention of

rebidding for the space. In,

fact, the restaurant's propri-
etor submitted a bid to use
the space as something
other than 21 Roy Rogers.
"It was time to bring

new items to the
Cathedral," said Salade-
Farina.

The space formerly

occupied by Roy Rogers is
now being assessed by
architects and engineers.
According to Food
Services, the kitchen will be
moved to a new location
and upgraded.

When asked how much
the entire project will cost,
Salade-Farina replied, "I
have no idea."

For The Pltt News

As the walls of the Cathedral turned
from stone gray to a rainbow of colored
posters yesterday, the race to be on Pitt's
Homecoming court oﬂicially came into full
swing.

With the Homecoming game fast

approaching, Pitt's king and queenhopefuls *

are preparing their campaigns and basing
them largely on one key factor: posters.

Thousands of them.

This year is the largest Homecoming
race in Pitt's history — with 17 female and
15 male candidates.

Many of the candidates in the election
race, which ends when the voting begins

 

THE PITT NEWS

Tuesday at 10 am, say competing for their
respective crowns is based on getting their
names and faces known on campus.

"I'm excited just like I would be in any
competition," said Scott Rhoads, a candi-
date for Homecoming king. "But it's differ-
ent now since it's not a sporting event. It's a
popularity contest."

Rhoads and many of the other candi-
dates in the battle claim that plastering
posters throughout the campus to get their
faces seen is the most important tactic.
Some candidates have already enlisted an
army of friends to help them out,

"I have a lot of guys who are going to

‘ help me hang posters," he said.

Some candidates, like Amy

Achenbach, are having no trouble making
sure their campus exposure is adequate.

"I got my posters done smoothly," _

Achenbach said.

Achenbach said the hardest part of the
exposure strategy is the placement of the
posters.

"The big places to hang them are in the
residence halls, Forbes Quad and Benedum
[Hal1]," she said.

Beginning yesterday morning, candi-
dates were allowed to plaster their photos
throughout the campus.

But making one stand out from the oth-
ers on a wall layered with the campaign
posters — in some places two - to three
posters thick — is a challenge  others

Television: responsible for low SATs

Henry J.

3’.

same across the board

A We used to have a chart in The Pitt News ofﬁce
that listed the power structure here at Pitt, with the chan-
cellor and Board of Trustees at the top and with students
at the very bottom. That is, until one of our custodians
came in and wrote a line even lower than that of the stu-
dents which read, “Janitors.” «

We tend to agree: The only group that this
University treats worse than its students is its janitors.

University union workers should receive the same
pay increase that everybody else at this school was
offered, as long as they stay on the job. It’s fair, it’s rea-
sonable, and it’s about time.

Local 29, the union encompassing University cus-
todians and maintenance workers, wants a 3-percent
increase. Everybody else in the University was offered a
2-percent increase, with a possible 1—percent bonus for
individuals who excel at their jobs. But the University
only offered the Local 29 workers a 2-percent increase.
The union rejected that offer and demanded a 3-percent
unconditional pay raise. ~

We recommend giving the custodians and mainte-
nance personnel the same offer that other University
workers received.

Pitt’s campus is well—kept; the workers from Local
29 do a good job here. They certainly deserve the same
offer that other University workers have been given.

But we also think that the union members should
not strike. Local 29 should stay on the job and prove to the
University that it deserves the same pay increase.

Striking is not the only way that a union can come
together as a group. Its members can also work together to
do a really good job.

The union workers have been doing exactly this
for two years, working in good faith for the University
without a contract. That is why we believe they have
earned this raise, but they should keep up the good work.

We sincerely hope that both the union and the
University will accept this as a reasonable solution. This
is a nice campus, and we’d like to see it remain that way.

I hate TV. Of course, those
who know me will say that’s not
true, and it isn’t, to a certain
extent. I do watch movies on TV,
whenever the broadcast compa-
nies can bring themselves to show
something remotely interesting.

Butlcansaythatlhave
never seen an episode of the “X-
Frles,” “Seinfeld,” “ER,” or even
“Baywatch,” the most popular

show in the known universe, ﬁom

start to ﬁnish. In some cases such
as “Baywatch,” it is because the
inanity of the script and acting
deﬁes belief, but in the main it is
simply because I don’t care.

Why should I watch a show
like “ER?” It isn’t funny, it isn’t

‘ interesting most of the time, and

anyway, it doesn’t gain me any-
thing other than wasting a few
hours of my time and a few kilo-
watt-hours -of electricity.

This is the main problem.
When you are sitting slack-jawed
in front of your 36-inch Sony with
a bag of Doritos on your lap and
your recliner kicked back in the
“full. zombie” position, you are
doing absolutely nothing other
than converting oxygen to carbon
dioxide and stimulating the
snack—chip industry. Of course, if
that’s your idea of time well-
spent, then I am perfectly willing
to sit by and watch the aging
process in action.

There is, of course, the ques-
tion that if TV is such an utter
waste of time, then why do so
many people tolerate devoting 15
to 20 percent of their life (don’t
laugh, think about it) to the altar of
the electron gun? Possibly

because we literally have nothing
better to do.

As advances in technology
and manufacturing make our lives
easier, and save us from the
drudgery of loading our CDs into
the player one by one, or from
washing dishes, or thinking, or
whatever it happens to be, we
have the good fortune to ﬁnd our-
selves with an excess of “leisure
time.”

So, what do we do with this
valuable commodity (and time is
the most valuable thing in the
world; wait until Bill Gates is 93
years old, and then ask him) other

‘than watching a rerun of a show

that we never really liked any-
way? Beeause TV is entertaining,
it’s ﬁee (sort of), and it’s addictive
— you turn it on, and don’t turn it
oﬂ°. And, other than maintaining
the pop—cu1ture system, it does
absolutely nothing for the viewer.

‘ The silly thing about this
whole argument, into which I

continue to get heavily involved -

with my housemate, who thinks
that TV is not only the opiate of
the masses but their nutrition and
education as well, is that when it
comes down to it, I actually sup-
port the compulsive watching of
the worst possible TV shows.
Wholeheartedly, even.

The reason that I support the
activity that I have just denounced
is because, in my opinion (and
note carefully the intentional use
of the word “opinion”), extensive
TV viewing, especially at an early
age, reduces one’s mental-visual-
ization ability. Actually, a lot of
scientiﬁcally and morally minded
people have objected to television
on these grounds, saying that our
country is degenerating into a

THE PITT NEWS

land populated by drooling cath-
ode-ray-tube junkies (or words to
that effect) with little or no cre-
ative —— visualization ability. So
what if this is true?

It means that those who
haven’t devoted half of their
childhood to staring at the tube
have an unmistakable advantage
over -» their compatriots in certain
areas. It might seem impossible,
but there are other fomrs of enter-
tainment that are actually educa-
tional, such as books.

In and of themselves, novels
aren’t educational, but the act of
reading actually stimulates the
part of the brain devoted to verbal
communication, which can hardly
be a bad thing. And when you
aren’t devoting yourself to the lat-
est pulp from John Grisham or

T Michael Crichton (who are, by the

way, making a relatively decent
living by sitting in front of a key-
board and reshufﬂing plots), you
might actually read something
worthwhile, like some classics or
a text by one of the great minds of
the world, and in the process
maybe even learn something.

But that, of course, would
never be enough to make reading
a required part of the school cur-
riculum. At least they don’t make
TV a requirement; I’d have failed.
‘ On the subject of failing,
there has recently been a lot of
concern over the recentering of
SAT scores, or rather the low
scores that make this recentering
necessary. The funny thing in this
debate is that it is rarely men-
tioned that the verbal section of
the SAT relies on one’s having a
large vocabulary.

Jessica

Birch .

Prior to my arrival here at our
beloved University on Aug. 23, I lived in
South Bend. (For those people who are
now saying, “Where?”, a.k.a. everyone,
South Bend is in Indiana, where Notre

V Dame is.) There are major differences

between South Bend and Pittsburgh, and,
being the nice person that I am, I’m
about to tell you what they are.

First of all, I’d like to establish that I
was not born and raised in South Bend. I
grew up in Pittsburgh’s Allison Park, and
when I was 11 or so, my parents decided
we were going to move to South Bend. I
decided almost immediately that I was
going to come back to Pittsburgh as soon
as I possibly could.

South Bend is a hick town. Its only

" claim to distinction is Notre Dame. All

true South Benders love Notre Dame. It

' is the ambition of almost every graduate

of the South Bend school system to go to
Notre Dame. The entire town is focused
on Notre Dame, or, to be more speciﬁc,
Notre Dame football. Some stores actu-
ally close during Notre Dame home
games. During my years in South Bend,
I must’ve seen at least three dozen
garages with leprechauns painted on
them. I think there are three sports bars,
possibly more, devoted exclusively to
Notre Dame sports. One is open only
during the football season.

Compare this to Pitt, where the most

_ excited sentiment I heard about the first

game was something along the lines of:
“I guess I’ll go. Maybe we’ll win. I don’t
have anything else to do anyway.” Now,
maybe this is just because I’m not an ath-
lete and don’t personally know any Pitt
football "players, but this seems a lot
healthier than the N.D. frenzy that most

THE PITT NEWS

of northern Indiana goes into whenever
there’s a football game.

I did expect that there would be
more things to do here, but I’m not com-
plaining. There are malls, there are
restaurants that stay open past 8 p.m.,
there are people, and perhaps most
importantly, there are no cornﬁelds with-
in sight.

Some people think that there isn’t
anything except corn in Indiana. That’s a
vicious lie spread by those who have
never actually been in Indiana. Anyone
who has gone for a
drive through northern
Indiana knows the
truth. Of course there’s
more than corn in
Indiana. There are also
soybeans and cows.

I don’t want to be
rude here, and I hope
I’m not offending any
one, but it seems to me
that people who live in
farm country have an
unhealthy fondness for
cows. Cows are okay and all, when
they’re in their place, which is in a ﬁeld
or on a plate. But in Indiana, people take
things a little too far. I went to the mall,
and there were farm animals in it. Cows,
ducks, rabbits, pigs, etc. Apparently
South Bend has a thing called “Farm
Wee ” in honor of the 4-H County Fair.
The new and original idea that the city
council came up with was to stable ani-
mals in the mall to teach children the
importance of farm products. For a week.

Now, I’m all for introducing children
to animals and vice versa, but somehow
this seems a little morbid to me. What do
you say to your children? “Little Jimmy, ‘
this is a pig. Think of him the next time
we eat bacon.” I don’t think so. Not to

  

Pittsburgh vs. |nc|iana:Smokers vs. Bovine

mention that farm animals are not the
sweetest-smelling creatures known to
man. A
Moving on, I’d like to say a few
words on the topic of regional dialect. I
know’ people who think that the classic
Pittsburgher sounds illiterate and class-
less, but I’m telling all of yinz that you’re
wrong. Until you’ve heard someone
from Indiana butcher the language as
would a slaughtered cow, you haven’t
heard illiterate and classless.

The first time I heard someone say
“root” the way that
generations of home-
grown Indiana folk
have mispronounced it
for years, I didn’t
know what she was

talking about. In
Indiana, people give
“root,” “roof,” and

various other words
the same vowel sound
as “book.” Then again,
maybe living in a town
where people pro-
nounce Notre Dame as “Nudder Daim”
should lead one to expect speech prob-
lems. . .

I guess there are good points about
South Bend, though. For one thing, gas is
cheaper than here. And people don’t
smoke nearly as much. What is it with all
the people sitting around smoking here?
Are they trying to produce their own lit-
tle mushroom cloud? T

Anyway, I hope this helps you in
your future travels. If you’re ever in
doubt about where you are, look around.
If you see broken-down cars, tall grass
and comﬁelds, it’s Indiana.

Jessica Birch knows that the right word
is “pop, ” not “soda.”

expect to acquire a large vocabulary? By
watching TV? Unfortunately, the only
large words in the English language are
used for descriptive purposes, and with a

. FROM PAGE 10

visual medium like TV, all the description ’

is done by the picture —, the only words
you hear are dialogue, and believe me, the
characters on TV are hardly role models in
regard to using a vocabulary.

So, in a very large number of cases,
the students taking a test designed to deter-
mine their knowledge of the English lan-
guage have never even read more than a
few books. If you can remember all the
books you have ever read and list them off-
hand, then you are in trouble, my friend.
So how are students supposed to under-
stand words they’ve never seen?

It’s simple. They don’t, and the SAT
gets recentered. The solution to the prob-
lem? I think I’ve made that clear already.
Do I know what I’m talking about? Well,
my parents never allowed me to watch TV,

and so I read books instead. The SAT? I V .

missed a few questions.

And they were almost all in the math ‘

section. -

Don’t get me wrong. I think movies
are nothing less than one of the greatest art
forms of the present time, and I have good
reason to believe this; I’m a film major.
But TV isn’t art, it’s entertainment, and
when entertainment takes precedence over

education, then I have a problem with it. V
, Or, as I mentioned before, I don’t really ,

have a problem with it. Less competition
in the workplace, and all that.

I’ve got to ﬁnish this up now, though
— if I go on any longer I might miss the
“X-Files.” And that, let_me tell you, would
be a terrible thing.

Right.

Henry J. Mason doesn ’t think television is
evil, just a waste of time.

"In your face” reli-

gion isn’t represen-

tative of most

Bravo to Alison Novicki! We could-
n’t agree more and are deeply troubled by
the kind of in-your-face “religion’.’ she
describes on campus. We shudder to think
how many more people have been irrevo-
cably tumed oﬁ to religion by these tac-
tics than have embraced it. While Alison
still maintains a “tremendous respect” for
persons of faith despite the harassment
she has weathered, for others the
Christian faith has suffered a permanent
black eye at the hands of irresponsible,
Bible-wielding salvationists.

The Christian faith is about far more
than mere salvation. As chaplains with the
United Campus Ministry, representing
seven Protestant denominations at Pitt
and CMU, we hear our share of theologi-

cally unsound rhetoric
about the need for salva-
tion. We’ve heard so
much that some of our
ads in The Pitt News last
year asked the question
“Tired of being asked,
‘Are you saved?”’
because we wanted stu-
dents to know that not all
Christians on campus are obsessed with
adding notches (read: souls) to their big
leather Bible cases. The Christian faith is
about living now, not banking on a heav-
enly reward. Those concerned with the
salvation of others are questioning their
own, rather than living it out.

Alison implies quite right that faith is
a personal matter. But there is a difference
between personal and private. Indeed,
faith is ‘a decidedly public matter, for
believers do not live in a world within
themselves. Genuine persons of faith con-
front real dilemmas about war, corporate
welfare and public policy, real decisions

  LETTERS

 

about how to spend
their money, and real
challenges to the mean-
ing of the separation of
church and state. These
are public issues about
which persons of faith
are informed by their
contact with their reli-
gious tradition and
through undertaking their personal faith
journeys. Faith is personal, but it is also
public.

The simplistic and shallow approach
taken by Alison’s harassers is not repre-

sentative of the genuine and public faith

of most Christians on campus. It is our
public prayer that harassment might give
way to compassion for body as well as
soul, and that Alison’s path may be filled
with invitation, not invective. Is there
room on Alison’s soapbox? .

the football team

Dear Pitt Students:

I want to tell you how much our
team, coaches and staff appreciated the
support that you showed during our win
over Southwestern Louisiana. It was a
great day in the stadium, and your vocal
support was a big part of that excitement.

I remember coming to play in Pitt
Stadium in 1989 with Ohio State, and I
could not believe the intimidation of the
crowd, in particular, the noise from the
student section. I hope that we can dupli-
cate that same feeling on Thursday night
against Miami and for the rest of the sea-
son. You can be a big key to our success.

Thank you for the interest and sup-
port you have shown for the team, and
Go Panthers!

PS U hovers in
this week's tale
of the tape

Walt Harris has arrived, and he’s not
taking crap from anyone. _
The new ‘Sburgh Panthers’ head coach

has started a ﬁre under this team, and things ,

are changing.

Although the Panthers fell to unde-
servedly No. ]—ranked Penn State last week
in Boring Valley, Pitt recorded a win outside
of the win—1oss column.

Okay, Harris doesn’t want to hear about
“moral victories” or any other gibberish like
that because his team is still 1-1.

However, Joe Patemo and Penn State
were the losers last Saturday.

Although Penn State is a school that
prides itself on tradition and its squeaky-
crean image, it sure didn’t impress me.

I am certainly not the all-knowing fan
of college football -— far from it, actually —
but I can tell you that Penn State and every-
thing it stands for is like school on Sunday
— no class.

Perm State fans are spoiled. The caval-
cade of blue-and-white faithful travels to

Beaver Stadium like it’s Mecca, and what 

do these fans do once they get there‘?

Not much.

Fine, they have the “We Are Penn
State” chant, but other than that, all they
have to offer are useless opinions about
Pittsburgh — a city that they have probably
never been to because their lives are restrict-
ed to living on grass.

No,notthatgrass—thekindthatPitt
doesn’t have. ‘

Fine, Pitt may not have the best athlet-
ics progiam in ﬂie country. In fact, we don’t
really bring much to the table when it comes
to big-rnarket sports, but we do have one
thing that Happy Valley will never have —
a life.

When 1 ﬁrst came here in 1993, 1 was  

pleased to hear the “P-E-N-N S-T-Sucks”
chant. Yeah, Penn State could care less about
Pitt, and our playing them is a bigger deal to
us than vice- versa.

The fans at that game were watching
the overrated No. 1 team in the country.
They’ sure didn’t show it.

It was the ﬁrst game of the year. The
house was jammed with over 97,000 peo-
ple, about 400 of whom were rooting for
Pill, and we were louder than they were.

“We have to run the
football better than we
have all year,” said
Harris. “We can’t get
forced into those second
and longs like we did last
week. That puts too much
pressure on the passing
game.” '

The question: Who

will be running the foot-
ball?

Dwayne Schulters is
still the starter. He leads
the team in rushing and
carries with 113 yards on
28 carries and one touch-
down. Against Penn
State’s defense, Schulters
was held to just 27 yards
on 16 carries.

This week Schulters’
«backup, sophomore Hank
Poteat, transferred”his tal-
ents to defensive back.
He played in six games
last year at cornerback
and was also a defensive
star at Harrisburg High
School. Despite his back-
up role at tai1back,‘Poteat
has just seven carries for
two yards and a 0.3 aver-
age this season. On
Saturday, Poteat will be
the second-string right
cornerback behind junior
starter Chuck Brown.

“It was all Hank’s

[Poteat] decision,” said
Harris. “He feels that
right now he can be a bet-
ter defensive player.”
Poteat’s vacancy
leaves an opening for
Billy West. The senior
was the Big East
Offensive Player of the
Year as a sophomore in
1994. In filling in for the
injured Curtis Martin,
West rushed for 1,358
yards that year — the

fifth-best single-season
total in Pitt history.‘

It is undeniable that
West has talent. Heading
into this season, West has
averaged five yards per
carry for his career. In
mostly mop-up duty this
year, West has rushed for
79 yards on 18 carries for
a 3.9 average.

West is a gifted run-

It doesn’t seem too long ago when
the Houston Cougars were clawing
their way close to the top of the rank-
ings with the likes of Andre Ware.

After having three seasons with a
total of four wins, the Cougars
appeared in their ﬁrst bowl game since
1988 last year. Looking to repeat their
return to success this season, the
Cougars have instead gotten off to a

horrid 0-2 start.

Defense was supposed to be
Houston’s strength this year with 10
returning starters and a switch to a 3-4
scheme. With losses to Alabama (42-
17) and to California (35-3), the
Cougars defense instead had its claws
clipped, giving up 466 total yards to

Alabama alone.

Sanford will be running behind
Ben Fricke, ranked by The Sporting,

With Houston’s offensive line retum-
ing four starters, it will be a tough test
in the trenches for the Panthers.

“It’s harder to run the ball when

against the Pitt Panthers. Helton is
hoping that senior Mike Parker, the

seasons, will step up his play

several practices this season, includ-

responsibilities.

“Billy’s playing time will
depend on how prepared he is for
Saturday,” said Harris. “He is in a
tough position right now, because
he’ s been missing practices.”

Whether or not West is prepared,
he should still get a chance to play.

Nittany Lions?

With the typical Penn State fair—weath-
er garbage about how they should be killing
Team X by this amount, and then they turn
to the idea that the game has passed Joe
Patemo by, and on and on and on.

This was a win for ‘Sburgh. ‘

For the first time in a very long time I
stood up and cheered for the Panthers at a
game. So did the rest of my seating section,
which was ﬁlled with crazy students and
alumni and ﬂat—out ‘Sburgh fans who were
proud to be wearing Vegas gold and navy
blue.

Penn State fans were appalled, and they
even took some shots at the Panther contin-
gent. '
Who did they think they were dealing
with?

We have to face the looming fear of
gunﬁre and dance-club riots spilling into the
streets. What are Penn State taunts going to
do but push us even farther in our bashing of
a primitive city, primitive school and prirni—
tive culture. -

Penn State may have its share of decent,
quality people — that’s just the law of aver-
ages —— but booing Joe Patemo at the end of
the game when he wouldn’t go on the air to
try to justify his team’s bogus No. 1 ranking.

Rank is a good word to use when
describing Penn State.

From top to bottom, those fans don’t
deserve to have a team with such tradition
and talent.

They don’t deserve a beautiful campus
and enormous stadium.

You know what they deserve? They
deserve a round—trip ticket to Pittsburgh
booked for Sept. 12, 1998.

Mark your calendars and synchronize
your watches because the ‘Sburgh program
is on its way back to prominence. An upset
will be just the thing to push it over the
hump.

Nittany Lion postgame: the

Brian Knavish

Staff Writer

STATE COLLEGE, Pa. — The tailgat-
ing was impressive, but make no mistake
about it, everyone was in Happy Valley
for the game.

The always-clever Penn State faithful
did their best to try to trash the Panthers.
They wore buttons proclaiming “S-—t on
Pitt,” “Pittiful,” and “My two favorite
teams are Penn State
and whoever plays
Pitt.” -

STATE SUCKS! P—E-N-N-S-T SUCKS!”

The brave (or perhaps stupid) Pitt
fans let their voices be heard, singing this
at various times and at varying decibel
levels (all of them loud) on the way into
the game.

Unfortunately, it had no effect on the
hordes of Nittany Lion fans. Most of them
just sort of laughed it off as some sort of
absurd denial on Pitt’s part.

It is interesting, though, that follow-

As massive as the - stadium is, you
can’t help but wonder how they will ﬁt
some 97,000 people into the building for
the game. Once you get inside and ﬁnd
that you have less than one square foot of
bleacher to park your can on, it is easier to
understand how they manage to reach that
capacity.

But the building itself — with its bril-
liant green, natural-grass ﬁeld — creates
an air of mystique that’s reinforced by the
talent that the building houses. The
amount of NFL talent- that “Linebacker
U” spews out year after year is staggering.

The fans at Penn State know their
school has a reputation for producing
great players. They know that the players
on this year’s team are very talented, and
they had absolutely no problem with try-
ing to make the contingent of Pitt fans
aware of this.

“Who ‘da hell are these guys?” Jack
Mahoney, class of ‘84, asked, pointing to
a Pitt roster. “I hope we break a hundred
[points] today. And we suck, right?”

Mahoney was, of course, referring to
the modiﬁed Pitt ﬁght song in which the
blue-and—gold faithful proclaim, “PENN

The rivalry is back, and the deep-
rooted feelings of the supporters are what
make a rivalry great.

Once the game was over and the
rivalry resumed, Penn State fans could
fully concentrate on their second true
love: alcohol.

Few towns in America party as hard
as State College. This is primarily because
there’s not much else in State College
other than the university.

If you take Pitt out of Pittsburgh,
Pittsburgh will still be a major metropoli-
tan city unto itself. The same is true of
Columbus if you take away Ohio State.

But if you take Penn State out of State
College, the only thing you’d have left
would be cows —— they seem to be the
only ﬁxtures not draped in PSU regalia.

Virtually every single person within
the city of State College is either a stu-
dent, a university employee, or an
employee of the hundreds of restaurants,
retail shops, banks and bars that cater to
the university.

This is one of the reasons why their
spirit is so impressive. Everything around,

Pittsburgh's the top pmoney-mcrker in Moak’s week 3 picks

Maybe it’s appropriate that there aren’t

‘ many interesting college football games

going on this weekend. After all, Sept. 20
has been circled in red on every college
football fan’s calendar ever since this sea-
son’s ‘schedule came out (Nebraska at
Washington, Tennessee at Florida, etc.). We
need to rest up for next Saturday. In the
meantime, we’ll have to settle for one big

game this weekend. That would be 

Colorado (+1) at Michigan

Colorado is ranked eighth in this
week’s AP poll; . Michigan’s l4th.
Theoretically, that would make Colorado
the better team. Sure, home—ﬁeld advantage
means something, but this means some-
thing, too: This is Michigan’s first game of
the year. Its players haven’t had a chance to
work together yet. That could be the differ-
ence in this game. p
Colorado 24, Michigan 21

Stanford (+13) at North Carolina
This game comes in a distant second on

this week’s big-game scale. For as long as

they’ve been good, the Tar Heels have been

carried by their defense. Stanford’s defense
came out strong early on, then later sealed
the game for the team with a big intercep-
tion against San Jose State last week. This
game should be a defensive battle. In a
defensive battle, especially between . two
top-25 teams, it’s tough tocover a 13-point
spread.

North Carolina 14, Stanford 10 V

Boise State (+15) at Central Michigan

I know that neither one of the people
who care about this game will read this.
Even so, I couldn’t resist making a pick,
simply because of these two teams’ fortunes
last week. You may recognize Central
Michigan as the punching bag of a team that
lost 82-6 to Florida last week. They come

back the week after that as 15-point
favorites? Well, Boise State is that bad. In
the preseason power rankings of all 112
Division I—A teams, Boise State checked in
around 110th, depending on who you ask. It
had its one good game this year last week
when it lost by a mere four points to
Wisconsin.

Central Michigan 38, Boise’ State 14

West Virginia at Boston College (+6)
West Virginia has played two pretty-
good games so far this season. Boston
College has played one horrible game this
season, It’s always bad when you lose to
Temple, but the way the Eagles’ lost last
week, blowing a 14-0 lead and then giving
up a garne—winning touchdown in the last
two minutes, was demoralizing. Based on
last week’s performance, Boston College
might not be able to beat Boise State.
West Virginia 30, Boston College 13

Arizona State (+9) at Miami -

Trophy last year, no player meant more to
his team than did Sun Devil quarterback

This week’s best bet:
Pittsburgh (+3) at Houston

Earlier this season, I pondered whether
this year’s Houston team was the one that
went to the Liberty Bowl last season or the
one that went 4-28-1 in the preceding three
seasons. This just in: It’s the latter, Boise
State—esque version. The Cougars’ two
games so far have both been blowout loss-
es, by a 77-20 combined score. The
Panthers may not be world beaters, but
they’ve at least looked respectable. There is
no logical reason for Houston to be favored.
Pitt should not only cover the spread, but
win outright.

even off campus, is Penn State. The peo-
ple there live and breath Penn State.

Penn State is the fu1l—ﬂedged college
life, which is why on Saturday night, hun-
dreds of parties and oceans of alcohol lit
up the town.

People were lined up down the streets
of Beaver Hill to get into mansion—1ike
fraternity houses, complete with chande-
liers and hardwood ﬂoors, where DJ s and
live bands played into the early hours of
the morning.

Everyone got along — Penn State
fans and even the occasional sprinkling of
Pitt students who stuck around for the
night. At this point, everyone was aware
that the game was a game and that it was
meant to be fun.

Even at the height of intoxication,
discussions of Nittany Lion players past
and present could be heard. The fans are
being treated to another great Nittany
Lion team this season. Perhaps the best
example of what the team does for the
university is its famous chant, which can
be heard every time the Lions score a
touchdown, or even make a good play,
and even on College Avenue at 2:00 a.m.

In impressive unison, the fans engage
in the thunderous chant. The chant itself is
a little less impressive: “WE ARE 
PENN STATE!” Whether the chant is an
overstatement of the obvious or a cry for
help due to an identity crisis isn’t totally
clear, but that’s not the point.

The chant is the fans’ way of sending
a message to the players on both side-
lines. The message is that football at Penn
State isn’t just about what happens on the
field. Football at Penn State is about thou-
sands of people uniting in support of their
university.

The tradition is there, the rivalry is
back. No matter what your feelings are
about that speciﬁc team, the Penn State
experience is college football as it should
be.

 FROM PAGE 13

Houston will look to Robbie Wheeler

as the prime target. Wheeler leads the,

tean1’s sputtering offense in receiving
so far this season, hauling in eight
catches for 114 yards. Six of those
catches came in the losing effort
against Alabama, including a 57-yard
touchdown reception, the longest of his
career.

Wheeler also handles the kickoff-
return duties for the Cougars. This
weekend, for a change, the Houston
junior will not be among the fastest ath-
letes in Robertson Stadium.

As an additional bonus for the
Cougar faithful, Carl Lewis will be run-
ning the 4 x l00-meter relay in his last
official race at halftime on Saturday.
Lewis, who is a graduate of the
University of Houston, will be running
with three other Olympians.
