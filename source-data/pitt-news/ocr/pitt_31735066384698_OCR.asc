A_.._. progress report of the
University Honors Program insti-

presented to; the College of Arts
and Sciences Council yesterday by
program director Alex Stewart.

Stewart began underscoring the

office gandpga special faculty task

“In developinlg  ‘program ._we

set three basic lproperties or  a

general recipe to follow in what we

thought to be an honors course,”
Wart said. “We wanted courses
t at we-thought were challenging,

demanding and stimulatingly
taught in return for the efforts the
students put into the course.”
According to Stewart, 120
students enrolled in honors courses
for the‘ winter term, and the
academic results were “pleasing."

V Stewart said‘ that at the
program’s  questions

were raised by tlillelifadministration ‘

concerning faculty and student
interest. _

“We made an all-out effort to
publicize the program -in the winter
term as a series of courses,
designed to- respond to the needs of
talented, irfdustrious students,”
Stewart said. A

The Honors Program has also
undertaken development of aca-
demic study in other areas,
including the institution of inde-
pendent study and reseagch pro-
grams Within the aSchlo‘:ols ~ of
Engineering and Medicine.

“We don’t advertise these
programs as formal courses but
rather keep a list in our offices,”
Stewart said.

to Joe Dutton, vice chancellor for

The state «is currently $20 million
behind in itspayments.t’o Pitt for the
1978 ﬁscal year, causing the
University to obtain loans at eight
percent interest in order to make up
the deﬁcit.

Dutton estimated that Pitt, has
lost $1 million through interest paid
on those loans and through interest
lost on cash reserves the University
would have normally been able to
maintain. I ’ - '

“The July appropriations go-
directly to cover operating’ ex-

The cutbacks have come in the

Two Pitt students have_ been
chosen through the Honors Pro-

working at the United Nations in
conjunction with Long Island
University. B

“These students were chosen
from a ﬁeld of all the major
universities in the nation for this
tremendous experience of studying
New York as a melting pot.”

Some concern was raised by
members of the Council that the
program might focus too heavily on
a small portion of the student

“If we tried to direct our efforts
to all students, it would be a wasted
effort because it would be too
diluted,” said Prof. Larry Epstein
of the chemistry department.

“Sooner or later, though, this
type of maintanance is bound to
catch up on you,” Dutton siad.

Jack Freeman, vice chancellor for
planning and budget, said Pitt has
been forced to make $12 million in
cutbacks in various areas and used
that money to pay for mandated
increases.

Dutton also stated that Chancel-
lor Posvar enacted a freeze on the
hiring of University employees last
September possibly to prevent"
elimination of services to members’
of the University community.
Clerical positions that have become
vacant since that time have been
ﬁlled with past-time employees,
while several professional positions
have gone unﬁlled. He added that
the manpower shortage causes
directors and their top assistants to .
log between 50 and 60 hours per
week during the peak work periods.

“For example, the University
received no state support for the

which cutbacks can be made. The
vice chancellor could not determine
how much each school will be asked
to’ cut back but said the ‘overall

~ Dutton also said that. many
University employees arepaid less
than people earn for doing
comparable work for a downtown
business.

“If we are not able to pay our
secretaries a representative salary,
good people will be lost,” Dutton
said. “That affects University
services just as much as a direct
cutback to a certainlarea.

“The reality of the situation is
that you can come down to only so
many cutbacks,” Dutton said,
“then you have to start eliminating
services.”

Pitt News Staff Writer

Pitt’s present participation in Oakland
_ Directions Inc. (ODI) has suggested a‘ change
in its approach to University expansion and
development. Cooperating with 18 other local
civic,‘ government and business groups,
administration representatives are helping to
structure tentative planning proposals for the

area. -

People in the University are trying to work in

a new kind ofway, ’ ’ said the Rev. James Ray of '

University and City Ministeries and ODI.

In the past, the school, it has been said, has
expanded into the community with little
concern about resident reactions, causing
alienation among affected University
neighbors. _ 1

“A greatnumber of people at this point are

I - cynical and fearful-about the .University,l A I P

 

- ppjpwiths its,.pt1annin-gt goal “to _p“mm

University and people to prevent situations
that cause that cynicism.”

The University now notiﬁes ODI about
projects through its representatives, and Pitt’s
unconcern about the greater Oakland
neighborhood now seems a part of the past.

“We have urged the University to enter in
dialogue,” said Ray, “and to tell us what they
are doing. That has happened, but we want to
see more communication in the future..’_’

Channels of dialogue are not perfect,
however.

“Projects are sprung on the community at
what seems to be the last moment,” said Ray,
who attributed the problem to] various
bureaucracies within the school being unaware
of each other’s projects,

OD-I recognizes Pitt’s growth as ‘a necessity

   

 

self-renewal of Oakland’s institutions in
response to change and pressure for growth.”
That statement, Ray said, is to acknowledge
that Oaklanclcolleges and hospitals have to
grow “within reason.”

‘ ‘That does not mean at all we are saying it is
O.K. for the University to keep steamrolling
over the community,” Ray said. “We are just
trying to keep open to all the interest groups in
Oakland.”

Institutional expansion is only one of ﬁve
goals listed by the development corporation.
Competing goals are to create a total
transportation system, stabilize and upgrade
residential neighborhoods, improve business
districts and better public safety measures. In
the future, the value of Pitt expansion will
probably be weighed in comparison to these
other objectives for the area.

" 72 Years of Collegiate Journalism at the University or Pittsburgh”

  Community Relations

University cooperation with Oakland Directions Inc., indicates
officials here finally recognize Pitt’s responsibility to the general
community directly touched by the decisions made every day within
the walls of the Cathedral.

For years, administrators made their expansion plans without
regard to the concerns of city residents in the Oakland neigh-
borhood. With the awesome power of the General State Authority
behind them, officials purchased lot after lot of land to improve
and expand the campus, often completely ignoring the detrimental
impact on the local environment.

These actions, termed arbitrary and insensitive by neighborhood
groups, have fired feelings of antagonism among Oakland citizens
and created an attitude of “cynicism and fear” toward University
policies. But finally, after losing a few Pitt-community confron-

tations, administrators have chosen to begin working with neigh-

borhood leaders.

‘Acknowledging the need for local input into Pitt’s development
plans shows a wise departure from the selfish, fully internal policy-
making procedure of the past. By accepting this input, the Univer-
sity fulfills its responsibility to the local citizenry, and tensions built
between Pitt and Oakland residents are relaxed.

After taking the preliminary steps toward building a better image
in Oakland, officials must keep on the path leading to a solid

A reputation as a concerned neighbor. Pitt must not treat its im-

proving relationship with the community in a self-serving fashion,
manipulating it for public—relations purposes. Instead, genuine
concern for the residents of Oakland must be one of the top criteria
moderating any policy decision. A mature institution of learning in

the 19705 can take no other approach.

Letters to the Editor

i Bob Casey for Governor Endorsement

“Passions in academic politics
run high because the real stakes are
so low. ’ ’ This favorite statement of a
long-time colleague of mine seems
not to apply to the current
non-academic primary election
campaign in which a dozen
candidates for the gubernatorial
nominations in both major parties
are involved.

In the last week of the campaign, I

offer this (perhaps) biased analysis
of the Democratic race:
Kline declining;
Flaherty fading;
Casey moving ahead.

Both the personal political
machine of the Flaherty brothers
and the Shapp organization ma-
chine are sputtering. The mo-
mentum is now with the original
Bob Casey, who is familiar with the

Harrisburg scene without being a
part of it or a party to it. Our best bet
for not only a clean but an effective
administration of Pennsylvania
affairs lies with Casey.

I urge fellow Democrats to pull
the Casey lever on Tuesday, .May
16.

Rampant N egativism in the Gubernatorial Race

By R. DAVID TIVE

V Next Tuesday is primary election
day in Pennsylvania, and voters will
go to the polls in unimpressive
numbers to choose the Democratic
and Republican candidates for
many offices, including Governor.
Most public-opinion surveys indi-
cate that both parties’ races. for
Governor are close, and many
people are having a tough time
making up their minds. That's not
too surprising. It's hard to choose
between" so many candidates, most

- of whom are merely trying to be

more negative than the others.
Politics in Pennsylvania this year
is negativism run rampant. It is as
if the new election law, in addition
to requiring partial disclosure of
campaign contributions, also re-
quired that no candidate he allowed
to’ say anything positive other than
to positively say that everything is

' negative.

The voters of this state have been
exposed to a diarrhetic outpouring
of charges of overtaxation and
official corruption. The candidates

for Governor are obsessed with the
past; perhaps because they feel
they can make political hay that
way, and perhaps because they
don’t have anything intelligent to
say about what they would do in the
future. It could be a combination of
both.

Sure, there are one or two
exceptions to this rule among the
gubernatorial candidates, but for
the most part, all the others are
busily searching for the lowest
common denominator in the
election. Most have- found it,
without stirring too far from where
they started. A quick review of

‘the main candidates proves the

point: ,
On the Democratic side, there are
three major candidates, Pete
Flaherty, Bob Casey and Ernie
Kline. Of the three, the first two
clearly fit the negativist pattern.
Flaherty has got to be the “King
of the Negatives” in the Democratic
Party, a regular “Mayor No.” In
seven years as mayor of Pittsburgh
he held true to the old song,
“Whatever It Is, I’m Against It.”
Casey is similar. He has been

running against things, particularly
Governor Shapp,.since 1966 when
Shapp first beat him for Governor.
Both Flaherty and Casey have
based their entire campaigns on a

THOUGHTS AND
REFLECTIONS

“Little or nothing has
been said about what
they intend to do as
Governor. Where do
they stand on aid to
education, both higher
and primary-secondary?
If they cut taxes, how do
they intend to fund
essential state services?
Do they think there are
any essential state ser-
vices?”

combination of the two “big”
issues—overtaxation and cor-
ruption.

Little or nothing has been said
about what they intend to do as
Governor. Where do they stand on
aid to education, both higher and
primary-secondary? If ‘they cut
taxes. how do they intend to fund
essential state services? Do they
think there are any essential state
services? If they do make drastic/
cuts in the state payroll, what
happens to the men and women who
lose their jobs. most of whom have
no involvement at all with the

corruption of the past eight years?

With five days to go in the
campaign. neither Flaherty nor
Casey is stressing any of those
questions.

Kline is in a different situation.
he doesn‘t fit*the‘negativist mold.

As a member of the Shapp
administration, irregardless that he
was essentially powerless for the
past eight years and that no one has
even alleged any wrongdoing on his
part, he is hardly in any position to
campaign on an anti-corruption
platform. He could, however,
campaign on an anti-tax platform,
but has chosen not to do that.

In fact, Kline has endorsed an
increased gas tax to help pay for
road repairs. Given the positions
being taken by his opponents, it is a
gutsy stand, one that may hurt his
chances of winning.

The Republican scramble is
similiar to the Democratic. There
are ﬁve major candidates-—Dick
Thornburgh, David Marston, Arlen
Specter,‘ Bob —Butera and Henry
Hager. Of the five, the first four. can
clearly be painted negativist.

In following the Republican
candidates one hears very little
about reducing taxes. It is mostly
corruption, corruption, corruption,
followed by more corruption. That
situation is inevitable when former
prosecutors, Thornburgh, Marston
and Spector, are running. Butera,
who is not a prosecutor but has
made a career of attacking the
Shapp administration for eight

‘ years, has joined the chorus.

A funny thing happened on the
way to the ,Governor’s Mansion,
however. The voters didn’t respond
to the corruption issue; they became
bored with it. They offered the
candidates, particularly the Repub-
licans. with the perfect opportunity
to talk about something (anything)
of some importance to the future of
the sfate.

But the candidates didn’t take it.
The A hot issue became which
Republican had the best chance of

winning in November. That debate"

may have relevance to those people
who believe the only good
Governor» is a "Republican

Governor, a throwback to the old
philosophy that the only good
Indian is a dead Indian, but it
hardly deals with the problems
facing the state.

The Republican primary offers
one candidate who is not following
the pack--Henry Hager. ‘His theory
is that if the other four candidates
split the big-city vote and he takes
the rural-Republican vote, he can
win. Therefore, he is stomping all
the backroads of the state, talking of
things that are important to the
people who live there. He is not
ignoring the corruption issue, but
he is not wallowing in"it. One may
question Hager’s. arithmetic, , but
one has to be encouraged by his
approach.

It remains to be seen how soon



 

gt!

Pennsylvania voters will tire of the *

candidates’ negative tactics. That
reaction is already beginning, but
its progress is very slow and not
very widespread. It may be big
enough to help KlineTuesday, but
probably won't be able to secure a
victory for Hager.

Pennsylvanians may then be
faced with a situation in November
in which two negativists are running
against each other, forcing a choice
between the two. Hopefully by
then, the candidates themselves
will have realized the error of their
ways and will have started stressing
what they would do if elected
governor. If not, Pennsylvanians
are in for trouble.

Once politicians find something
that works, they tend to stick to it. If
all the next governor takes with him
from this campaign is the lesson.
that negativism is the best
approach, then the state is in for
four years of official negativism
from the Governor's office. Given
the condition the state is in now.
that could prove to be a fatal!
disease. '

By The Associated Press

Two Republicans stalked votes on
Philadelphia streets and subway
stops yesterday, while their guber-
natorial primary opponents spoke
of human services and the death
penalty.

Former Philadelphia District
Attorney Arlen Specter raised the
capital punishment question in
Altoona after thumping a crime-
ﬁghting theme earlier at an Erie
press conference.

“There are vicious criminals in

_/ this world who, if sane and‘ if

convicted, should be executed,” he
said.

“It is not pleasant to contemplate
an execution,” he added, “but it
pales alongside consideration of the
hateful violence that too often
appears in our world.”

Specter pointed to the assassina-
tion of former Italian premier Aldo
Moro as an example of cold-blooded
murder that capital punishment can
avenge.

David Marston, campaigning
with his wife and their 6-year-old
son near Philadelphia’s City Hall,
dealt with a less grim subject-

“ Philadelphia school ﬁnances:

“Before you increase the
revenue, you’ve go to make sure the
program is working, and I’m not
sure you can say Philadelphia’s
educational program is,” he told a

. street vendor.

“Instead of mandating a lotof
fancy programs out of Harrisburg,”
Marston added, “you’ve got to
make sure that when the kids get
out of 12th grade they can read and
write and ﬁll out an employment
application.”

Former House Majority Leader
Robert Butera joined campaign
workers at a transit stop to shake
hands.

“This is hard,” he said at one
point as morning commuters rushed
past. But he added later that the
experience is worthwhile.

“It ﬁlters the community with
name identification and some
personality identiﬁcation, ” he said.
“The other thing is it keeps you
humble. If you never talk to people,
you start to think you’re important,
and you’re really not.”

In Pittsburgh, Richard Thorn-
burgh and Henry Hager were
among the gubernatorial hopefuls
who addressed the annual meeting
of Community Services of Penn-
svlvania.

‘Candidates Turn to Streets To Seek
sGubernatorial Primary Votes

“As the parent of a mentally
retarded son and as one who has
been the beneficiary of many good
people's efforts. . .my priorities are a
little more service oriented than
they are dollar oriented,” said
Thornburgh.

“There are a lot of ﬁne details
that can be‘ discussed about
priorities for human services, but I
think that when you talk about a
governor...you look for instincts,”
he said. \

“You look for how a man feels
about his obligation to translate
what we have—a rich and generous
society—into real services for the
people,” he said.

Hager, Republican floor leader of
the State Senate, pledged to give
volunteer groups in the human
service ﬁeld more say in state
government.

“There is real need to develop a
more cooperative attitude with all
volunteer agencies,” Hager told the
convention delegates.

“I think that means having
people in policy-making positions
who have been where you are, who
know what your problems are, and
who can bring your level of
expertise in dealing with human

~ needs.” he added.

Bierce Collection

By PATTY TASCARELLA

The Stories and Fables of Ambrose
(Bierce

Selected and with an Introduction
by Edward Wagenknecht
Illustrated by Ferebe Streett
Stemmer House

Ambrose Bierce was one of the
first of the American dark

ARTS

humorists. His bitterly ironic fables
pre-dated James Thurber’s, yet
Bierce is relatively obscure. Pos-
sibly, this is because he held a
sardonic view of mankind when
expansionism and concepts of
manifest destiny prevailed in
America in the latter half of the 19th
century. But the recent revival of

Bierce’s works. with his ‘bizarre
imagination and chilling descrip-

tions of death, reveal him as one of
the most important inﬂuences on
contemporary fiction.

“The Stories and Fables of
Ambrose Bierce” is an excellent
collection of Bierce’s best short
stories, including “The Monk and
the Hangman’s Daughter,” his
most famous work.

The additional biography sup-
plied by Edward Wagenknecht is a
fine accompaniment. Wagen-
knecht, a professor at Boston
University, provides a well-re-
s_e_a_rched_ history of Bierce that is
lengthy enough to satisfy the
reader’s curiosity, yet concise. And
Wagenknecht does not interject
anecdotes throughout- Bierce’s
works. i

The eerily beautiful artwork by
Ferebe Streett is itself worth the
price of the book. Classically art
nouveau and verging on Aubrey
Beardsley, the illustrations satisfy
and horrify at the same time; almost
the same effect as Bierce’s stories.

There is little beauty in Bierce’s
works and laughter comes easily,
but in a very bitter way.

 
 
 
 
  
  
 

 he found himself
staring into the sharp-
I5 drawn face and bﬁlnk,
éeab eyes of his own
mother, stanbing
wﬁite nub silent’ in
('69 garments of
tﬁegnuwl

I
/
/// .

j //

Ferebe Street's illustrations for the recently reprinted tables of Ambrose Bierce are a fine compliment to the

writing.

Ca vanaugh Will Undergo Surgery That's ‘No Big Deal’

Former Pitt quarterback Matt Cavanaugh will
have a torn medial cartilage in his left knee repaired
during surgery at a Pittsburgh hospital Monday, but
a spokesman for the New England Patriots says it is
“no big deal.”

Cavanaugh, an all-America at Pitt last season
before the Patriots chose him in the second round of

last week’s National Football League draft, tore the‘

cartilage March 22 during a game of touch football at
Pitt Stadium.

The Pitt quarterback had been expected to be
selected during the first round of the draft, but
rumor concerning his injured knee—rumor fueled by
Cavanaugh’s unwillingness to make public the
damage—caused several teams to pass on the Pitt
quarterback before New England made him the 50th
player chosen.

Dr. James McMaster, Pitt’s team physician and
the man who will perform Cavanaugh’s operation,
told the Patriots before they drafted Cavanaugh that
there might be a problem with the quarterback’s
knee.

“McMaster told us the knee was O.K., but that
there might be a problem with _the cartilage,” Jim

' Valek, assistantjgeneral manager at New England,

said‘ by phone from his office at Schaeffer Stadium
yesterdav.

“We figured‘ we’d bring him here and have him
examined by our physician, and he verified that Matt
did have a cartilage problem,” Valek continued.
“So we and Matt decided together to get the

» operation out of the way.

    

“We (the Patriots) weren’t really concerned one
way or the other about the operationbefore we draf-
ted him,” Valek said. “A cartilage really is no big
deal—we figure on a six-week rehabilitative period,
and training camp is 10 weeks away.”

The Patriots’ apparent foreknowledge of
Cavanaugh’s condition places their scouting above
that of several NFL teams. Word concerning-
Cavanaugh’s condition took many forms as it passed
around the league. Some teams believed the Pitt
quarterback was fine; others were sufficiently scared
by reports of injury that they were hesitant to draft

Cavanaugh. In any case, a fog surrounded his status.

“We were told the opposite,” San Francisco per-
sonnel director Howard White said yesterday when
told Cavanaugh would have to undergo surgery.
“We had heard before the draft that he would have
to be operated on...we even heard at one point that
he was in the hospital for the surgery. But when we
called some people in Pittsburgh, we were told he was
fine.

“We invited 29 guys to have pre-draft physicals,”
White added. “And Cavanaugh’s the only guy who
didn’t show. At first, Matt told us he would come,
but then (Nick) Buoniconti (Cavanaugh’s agent)
called and told us Matt wouldn’t be able to make
it. . .it was then that we became suspicious.”

The New York Jets’ information was to some
degree better than that obtained by the 49ers before
the draft.

“We were aware there might be a problem with
Cavanaugh’s knee,” Mike Hickey, the Jets’ top
scout, said yesterday. “We got that from our
sources. But we still talked about Cavanaugh when
our choice came up (early) in the second’ round.

“And if he had been available in the third round, I
would have taken him no matter what waswrong with

' him,” Hickey added. “He’s a good quarterback.”

Panthers (To Host 27 Squads 1
At Eighth Pitt Invitational

By MARIA SCIULLO
Pitt News Staff Writer
Twenty-seven schools will clash
in the eighth a.nnual Pitt Track and

Field Invitational this weekend at .

Pitt Stadium. Among the entrants
are East Carolina, Penn State, Ohio
State, Georgetown, Purdue, Al-
legheny Community College (1978
national indoor junior college

5 champion) and West Virginia.

9

A ‘‘I’m quite excited about this
meet,” said Pitt coach Mike

Agostinella. “We have about eight

or 10 all-Americas participating in
this week’s competition from
various schools and this will
certainly provide outstanding con-
tests.”

As always, East Carolina is a
favorite in the sprints. ECU’s
440-yard relay holds the Stadium
record and also looks strong in the
mile relay. Otis Melvin of ECU, an
all-America 200-meter man last
season outdoors, comes into
Friday’s trials as a solid choice to
win the 400 meters.

The 800-meter race could be won
by any of the 30 entrants who have
already turned in times of 1:53 or
faster. The 1500 meters is a
different story; the finals could
develop into a three-man contest

between ACC’s Amos Korir, Penn
State’s Mike Wyatt and George-
town’s Kevin Byrne. All have run
times close to four minutes flat in
the mile this season, and Byrne is
the IC4A indoor mile champ.

The Panthers have a strong
chance of picking up a first place in
the 5000 meters with Mel Boyd.
According to assistant coach Dan
Sullivan, Boyd is" coming along
slower than last year but is about
ready to burst ‘loose with a good
race. Boyd will be challenged by
Nittany Lion Bob Snyder, who was a
third-place ﬁnisher at the Penn
Relays.

Pitt’s'Dave McDonald, holder of
three school records, is entered in
the 10,000 meters, in which
Cleveland State’s Marc Hunter will
give spectators a chance to see the
NCAA’s top American cross-
country runner. _

The Panthers could conceivably
do well in some field events. At the
top of the list is high jumper Dan
Goodyear, who holds the Pitt record
at 7-1. Last year’s Invitational
winner, Noel Ruebel of Purdue,
returns to defend his title; he is also
a seven-foot-plus jumper. Pole
vaulter Gene Roach feels “ready to

Kline ’s Migration from

By KAREN KADILAK

Rich Kline is amused.
“Whenever people find out I’m
from Florida, the first thing they

want to know is why I came to Pitt, ” »

said the Panther’s freshman
leftfielder « from Miami. “They
think I'm out of my mind to be
playing up here.”

Kline had several reasons for
coming to Pitt. For one, his father
played football for the Panthers;
Stuart Kline, started at center in the
.;1id-1950’s.

For another, none of the Southern
colleges Kline wanted to attend,
including Florida and Auburn,
offered him a scholarship. Pitt did.

‘ ‘They (the Southern schools) told
me I could have a scholarship if I
batted .300 or better during my
senior year,” Kline said. “I ended
up batting .280.”

Even if he were offered a
scholarship, Kline didn’t know
whether he would want to play
baseball at a Southern college.

‘‘I did and I didn’t,” the Panther
starter said. “Baseball in the South

is great. There’s no doubt about
that. Those people down there are
crazy about it.

“But, Ireally wanted to come to
Pitt,” he added. -“I’m a big sports
fan. Here in Pittsburgh, ifl want to
see a pro football game, I can go see
the Steelers; Ifl want to see a major
league baseball game, I can see the
Pirates. If I want to see a hockey
game, I can see the Penguins. There

E CA G Officials to

_ ending tournament.

Officials of the Eastern Eight, the
ﬂedgling basketball conference of
which Pitt is a charter member, will
meet in Hershey early next week to
discuss the circuit’s immediate
future.

Part of that future could take
place at the Civic Arena, since the
league’s athletic directors, stunned
by the ﬁnancial success of last
year’s three-day tournament at the
Arena, are seeking to return to
Pittsburgh with next year’s season-

break the Pitt record (his own, 15-0,
set earlier this season) and clear
15-6.” The host team’s Don
Maydak could possibly place in the
long jump.

Other athletes to watch ‘are
ECU’s Herman Mclntyre (53-1) in
the triple jump, Joe Johns,
Marshall University’s shot put and
discus specialist, and Catholic
University’s Chris Kilm, a 16-0
pole vaulter.

PANTHER TRACKS: Penn State
was anything but the gracious host
last Saturday as both the Nittany
Lions and the University of
Maryland handily defeated the Pitt
track team in State College.

Maryland’s hurdler, Reynaldo
Nehemiah (world record-holder in
the indoor 60-yard hurdles) won
four events as the Terrapins
excelled in the sprint races, but
Penn State’s long-distance runners
proved to be too much for either of
the visiting schools. ‘

The Panthers’ lone victory came
in a distance race, however; Mel
Boyd won the 5000 meters in 14:34.
Pole vaulter Gene Roach and high
jumper Dan Goodyear placed
second in their respective competi-
tions.

aren’t that many pro teams in the
South.” 3

Having played a dozen years in
the South, Kline has had little
trouble adapting to the Northern

brand of baseball. He is among the ,

team leaders in hitting, A runs batted
in and extra base hits. '
“If there’s one thing I hate it’s
the cold weather up here,” said
Kline. “Otherwise, I’ve enjoyed
myself.

But the Penguins are scheduled
to take the Arena ice Saturday,
March 3, for an NHL game that
would effectively freeze the Eastern
Eight out of Pittsburgh. If the
Penguins and Eastern Eight can’t
agree to terms that would give the
Arena to basketball Saturday
evening, the tournament would be
held at either Rutgers’s Athletic
Center or at West Virginia
Coliseum.

Pole vaulter Gene Roach successfully clears the bar.

Sullivan photo 

‘ ‘They play some good baseball in
the North,” he continued. “West
Virginia has a good team, and, from
whatl understand, Temple (one of
three teams Pitt will play on its
swing through eastern Pennsyl-
vania this week) has a good team.

“Comparing this to a Southern
school like the University of Miami,
UM is the best there is, ’ ’ Kline said.
“Anyone who plays there almost
has to be drafted. They have a

Discuss Future

League officials are split on the
question of whether to hire a league
commissioner-Pitt is opposed to the
idea. Also to be debated are: the
possibility of admitting additional
schools to the league; the problem
of officiating, which could be solved
through appointment of league
referees; the revamping of the
tournament format; and the move-
ment toward a schedule that would
have each team play each other
league member on a home-and-
away basis each season.

Miami Caused By Several Factors

hard comparing a program like that .

to, say, a Temple or a West
Virginia. A
A third-team, all-conference
selection at defensive football end
in his senior season at Miami
Palmetto High School, Kline had

several football scholarship offers. ‘

North Carolina especially wanted
the services of the 6-1, 190-
pounder. But there was never any
doubt in Kline’s mind aboutwhat
sport he wanted to play.

‘ ‘Baseball has always been one of
my loves,” he said. “I enjoyed
football—still do—but baseball is
my first love. In fact, if there’s one
thing I miss about Florida it’s the
fact you can’t play it all year round
here.

Although some consider
Southern Baseball better than that
played in the North, Kline doesn’t
think he’s any better than the rest of
his Panther teammates, all of whom
played their scholastic ball in

Mountaineering #4.

ma PTIMUM
 T-

, I  pleasures of mountaineering
'  7' " run the risk of being labeled
 social climbers. But such
‘N. cheap shots are to be ignored
They are the work of cynics, W
nay-sayerls and chronic

_ malcontents.

- Similarly, the ambience
of an athletic afternoon (eg.
The Big Game) is another
ideal moment. Downing
 the mountains elevates

.J the morale of the fan and,

* hence, the team. There-
fore, if you care at all about
the outcome, it is your duty to
mountaineer. B
i   When should one not

enjoy the invigoration of the
mountains‘? Here, you’ll be
happy to learn, the list is
much briefer.

Mountaineeringl is a skill
of timing as well as tech-

moment, like the
wrong method, _ M
marks the gap W‘ " p ,
between g 
amateur and ‘   j  _,

by the label outside and perpetuates due to the cold naturally refreshing taste inside. ( of. lessons 1,2. and 3.)

Bucs, Blyleven Blister Giants,5/-1 ,,

SAN FRANCISCO (AP)-Bert
Blyleven went to a windy but dry
Candlestick Park mound yesterday
an‘d"cooled off one of baseball’s
hottest teams, the San Francisco
Giants, with a six-hit, 12-strikeout
performance.

In his last start, the Pittsburgh
Pirates’ hurler allowediseven hits
and six runs in one inning plus
against the Los Angeles Dodgers
on a wet day in Pittsburgh.)

“The mound was muddy and it
was tough to throw a good curve.
But that one is over, just like this
game, and I’m not making
excuses,’,’ Blyleven said after
beating the Giants, 5-1.

“I had no pop on the ball last
time and the Dodgers are a good
hitting team. Today, Ihad pop and
was challenging the batters a lot
more,” he said.

His 12 strikeouts, the most in a’

game by a National League pitcher
this season, came mostly with
curve balls, the most the Giants
had seen in a long time.

“It’s hard to adjust to Blyleven.
He throws curves in all situations
and most National League pitchers

will ‘challenge you with the fast

ball,” said Willie McCovey. “He
throws the curve about 90 percent
of the time.”

Blyleven, said it was more like 60

percent of the time, but whatever,

it earned him his second victory in
the league. V

The Pirates stole ﬁve bases,
incuding Omar Moreno’s 19th of the

Frank Taveras singled in the ﬁfth
and Barr walked Moreno and Dave
Parker to load the bases. John
Milner hit a sacriﬁce fly for the ﬁrst

run and Stargell then doubled to‘

right-center.

Milner's sacriﬁce ﬂy was caught
by shortstop John Lemaster in
shallow left ﬁeld and the inﬁelder
made a weak throw to the plate,
allowing Taveras to score.

Bl_yleven struck out Larry Hern-
don with the bases loaded to end the
sixth. His ﬁnal strike out of the
game came in the ninth when, with
Jack Clark and Larry Herndon on
base, he fanned Marc Hill for the
second out. Lemaster then popped
up to end the game.

The RBI by McCovey was his 24th
of the season although he has just 18
hits.

Chipper Charley Hyatt, star "of Pitt’s only undefeated
basketball team and three time all—America died in St. Peters-

burg, Fla. on Monday.
