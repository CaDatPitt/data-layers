Justice Harlan Retires

  From Supreme

 WASHINGTON (AP) — John
Marshall Harlan. the scholarly

"conservative who was generally
rated as one of the Supreme
Court's most able jurists. retired
Thursday because of ill health. He
is suffering from cancer. '

The retirementeffective imme-
diately. was the second from the
nations highest court in less than
a week and leaves President Nix-

4_? on in the rare situation of having
' two crucial appointments to make
at the same time.

Associate Justice Hugo L. Black
retired last Friday, also for rea-
sons of health. Black was report-
ed in very serious condition at
Bethesda Naval Center. -

The 72-year-old Harlan was tak-
en to the Bethesda Hospital Aug.

termed a "backache." He was
later transferred downtown to the
George Washington University
Hospital.

 

After the White House announc-
ed Harlan's retirement. it was an-
nounced‘ at the court that he 1S

The Supreme Court is sched-
uled to open its fall term On Oct.
4 with only seven jilstices on the
bench and several major issues
awaiting decision. Perhaps para-
mount among these is the question
of whether capital punishment is
constitutional.

White House press secretary
Ronald L. Ziegler said Nixon rec-
ognized the situation and was ex-
pected "to move as swiftly as pos-
sible to find two highly qualified
individuals to fill the vacancies."

When Black's retirement was
announced Ziegler said Nixon was
Ci-. considering a list of seven poten-
tial_ successors. Ziegler said
Thursday he felt the list could be
expanded. "I don't want to lock it
‘;;atseven." he said. , . ,— .

The double vacancy was the
first since 1941 when Justice
James C. McReynolds retired and
Chief Justice Charles E. Hughes
quit five months later. President_
Franklin D. Roosevelt filled both
shortly after Hughes stepped
down.

Earlier Nixon appointed Chief
Justice Warren E. Burger and As-'
sociate Justice Harry A. Black;
man. “ F

The Harlan retirement will not
have as much ideological impact
on the court's makeup as will
Black's. Harlan was a solid mem-
ber of the courts conservative
side and Nixon is expected to re-
place him with an appointee of
similar bent. Black. on the other
hand. was considered a member‘
of the liberal bloc.

Nixon has commented frequent-
ly that he wants nominees who are
“strict constructionists” of the
Constitution.

Mrs. Richard M. Nixon has been
calling recently for a woman jus-
tice. She commented earlier this
week that Nixon had named sev-
eral women to district courts for
grooming “in case they don‘t get
one this time." referring to the
Justice Black vacancy.

Chief Justice Burger said Har-
lan‘s decision to retire was 
source of deep regret to all his
colleagues and a loss to the Court’
and to the country.

Ziegler relayed similar praise
from Nixon.

SENIORS interested in apply-
ing for the Danforth Fellowship
should contact Pat Roberts im-
mediately at the Counseling

forth Fellowship is awarded to
outstanding students who in-
tend to do college teaching.

1 Volunteer Army Imperiled

"We do have a bureaucracy here
that functions from time to time
in the best of bureaucratic fash-
ion. and that‘s what we have As-

/sistant Secretary Henkin for.“,

Friedheim said.

Privately. many officers have
expressed doubt over the Army's
ability /to field an all-volunteer
force. But this is believed to have
been the first time that the man
charged with bringing it about
expressed for the record such
serious reservations.

PITTSBURGH (AP i—Nearly one out of three area high school pu-

Ideas and Figiires

by JOYCE GEMPERLEIN

“When is the next issue of Ideas
and Figures coming out?” Si-
‘”lence. Then—-“Ideas and what?”
In the face of such questions, the
staff of Pitt‘s literary publication,
Ideas and Figures is struggling to
overcome the relative anonymity
of their efforts.
In the past, Ideas and Figures
has been known (or rather un-
known) as a type of collage of poe-

 ._try, photography, art, and prose

submitted by the student body.

.,;Becoming recognized by the stu-

dent body is one problem, but an
even greater obstacle for the staff
is becoming recognized as a pub-

Mlication «not centered merely on

poetry.
Keith Schuster, the editor, says

“that the main target of the organ-
‘ -ization is to ,f‘stimulate people to

be creative.” The staff “wants to
work with material that people
are interested in—not just literary
but art, layout, graphics, and
films.”

SCHUSTER
Stimulate Creativity

In an effortto combat anonymi-
ty and misconception of the role
of Ideas and Figures on campus,
the staff is crusading to change
the student body's conception of a
literary magazine.

“In the past, the books sold
have been bought largely by those
interested ’in English,” said
Schuster. The most important
thing this year, Schuster said, is
to “sponsor a magazine that will
become a cohesive force to both

student body and to our staff."

One of the means by which the
staff is doing this is by employ-
ing some visual effects. Sept. 20
was the deadline for submissions
for an Ideas and Figures poster.
This poster, Schuster hopes, will
make students aware that there is
an outlet on campus for their
creative endeavors. “People,
even if they aren’t interested in
literary things, will buy it to cov-
er the wall,” said Schuster.

The poster, slated to be ready
by the end of October, will com-
bine poetry and graphics. Experi-
mental films are also scheduled
and will be open to those inter-
ested in the magazine.

Ideas and Figures traditionally

' relies on the student body and

members of the organization to
submit material but accepts ma-
terial from anyone outside the
University. Works are selected for
publication at staff meetings. The
bulk of material tends toward poe-
try but, when good prose is sub-
mitted, it is included. When asked
about the theme of the next issue
of Ideas and Figures, due to be
out in February, Schuster said
that there is no one issue dom-
inating the magazine.

“The book will largely be de-
fined by the graphics and writings
as they are submitted and accept-
ed," Schuster said. Material is
now being accepted for the winter
publication.’

The main concerns of the staff

' ‘now seem to be establishing a rap-

port with the student body and
breaking out of the stereotyped
notion that Ideas and Figures is
a magazine for those few who can
write and understand obscure poe-
try.

With the wider scope proposed
by the staff, they hope that Ideas
and Figures will draw together
those interested in the arts. Those
already involved in the magazine
enthusiastically urge anyone con-
cerned to come, share ideas, and

see the “unknown" side of Ideas

and Figures. ’

  
  
    

   

Owl Goes Conventional

 

Yearbook Cuts Price

by TOM HEIPLE

Changes in the staff of this years Owl are re-
flected in the new ideas being considered for the
University yearbook. ’

The price has been cut from $7 to $5; the volume
will be increased by approximately 100 pages. The
actual size of the yearbook has also been increased
from 8‘/2 x 11 inches to 9 x 12 inches.

Additions being considered, according to busi-
ness manager Cindy Currens, and editor Paul Salva,
include sections on the graduate schools, commu-
ters, blacks on campus, curriculum reviews, hous-
ing, University expansion, and women’s liberation.

Student Government. campus police, foreign stu-
dents. gay liberation, clothing trends, and a wom-
en’s department are also being considered. For
each section several views will be taken and from
those views an article will be written. “The idea,“
according to Salva, “is to integrate the 'who1e-Uni-
versity into the yearbook."

“We hope to make up on volume what we lose on
the price,” said Currens, referring to the price de-
crease and size increase. She said that the circula-
tion of the yearbook totals only 1,800, so that by
encompassing the total University, the Owl will
achieve wider circulation and appeal.

According to Salva, a larger allocation from the
Student Association and a cost cutting drive will
mitigate the effects of the price cut.

Conventional is the way to describe the probable
format of the new Owl. Salva said he wants to do
away with the “gimmickery" and concentrate on
words and pictures. He hopes that the new edition
will be a single volume type instead of separate sec-
tions as in previousyears. “That kind of thing has
kind of run its course,” he said.

Students Discuss Careers

 

SALVA: “Gimmickery” abolished.

The Owl staff, one-third larger than last year’s,
appears to be of a different composition than previ- 1
ous years. Many more upperclassmen than fresh-
men have joined the staff this year, bringing with
them a broad range of. experience with the Univer-
sitythat, according to Salva, shows in the new ideas
being considered.

Memos will be sent to campus organizations re-
minding them that the Owl is open to suggestions.
"Anyone is welcome to come up and give his ideas,”
stated Currens.

though, time for decision on a ca-

The University Counseling Cen-

ter began a program last spring
to help any student who was un-

decided about a career, the "Ca-

Based on past successes, the
groups are beginning again, and
any interested sophomores are
urged to sign up at the Counseling
Center, 205 SU.

In this fall's program, the
sophomores will join small groups
for discussion of their talents,
goals, feelings, and uncertainties.
Each group will be led by two of
the students from last spring's
program, and will be assisted by
the center‘s staff. -

While the encounter-groups will

To Mentally Ill, Retarded

by BOB GEDEKEH

Idealistic talk about the human
condition and helping others
comes cheap on college cam-
puses. But some students are try-
ing out their ideals by working in
community service projects such
as those sponsored by Pitt's
YMCA.

Four YMCA programs are now
underway to fit the needs of emo-
tionally disturbed and retarded
people and the volunteers who
wish to help them.

Volunteers spend several hours
weekly working on a personal bas-
is with. people with mental prob-
lems. It is important that the vol-
unteers stick with the program.
for if the contacts with an individ-
ual. are suddenly broken. he ina_v
feel dejected or unwanted.

_ DAY CARE

A day care program for retard-
ed children,from the ages of eight
to 17 is being operated under the
auspices of St. Francis Hospital
and various foundations through-
out the area. The center is located
at the First Methodist Church in
East Liberty.

These children are ineligible for
public school programs because
their IQS aretoolow.This program
serves to socialize them and to
prepare them for more intensive
training programs. It also allows

"their families a'period of time

without the youngsters, offering
an alternative to institutionaliza-
tion.

Student volunteers. relate with

the children on a one to one basis.
showing them how to deal with
such problems as bus fares. street
directions and making change.
Volunteers spend as much time
as they wish at the center. which
is operated by a professional staff.

COFFEEHOUSE

A coffeehouse for mentally re-
tarded adults will be operated on
Tuesday evenings in St. Francis
Hospital. It will serve individuals
in halfway houses and those living
on their own in apartments. These
individuals presently have jobs or
are being trained for them.

The coffeehouse will give them
an opportunity to meet and so-
cialize.

Student volunteers set up the fa-
cilities. talk to the visitors. and
help to provide entertainment. It
is hoped that the mentally retard-
ed will assume these duties after
a period of time.

INSTI’I‘UTIONAL PROJECT

Two of the Y's projects involve
work in state institutions. one at
Mayview State Hospital and an-
other in Western State School and
Hospital. These programs involve
work with emotionally disturbed
individuals rather than with the
retarded.

The program at Mayview in-
volves adults who are likely to be
released after treatment. Rec-
reational activities. films. and
discussions are used to involve
the student volunteers with the
patients.

The CAS Advising Center. lo-
cated on the ninth floor of the Ca-
thedral of Learning. -x 296. bas-
ically offers services of an aca-
demic nature. according to Con-
nie Carroll. director of freshman
‘advising.

Carroll remarked that many
students confuse the Advising
Center with the University Coun-
seling Center. which deals pri-
marily with ‘students personal
problems. in addition to providing
career information.

The Advising Center is an infor-
mation center as well. Basically
organized to aid the student in
selecting a course of study, ad-
visors also aid students in regis-

tering, and provide information

on academic requirements.

Advisors generally work close-
ly with CAS and UCEP students".
Since the advisors are. with few
exceptions. graduate students
with one year of study. they are
better able to maintain rapport
with the students.

In addition to general advising.
the center offers a pre-law serv-
ice.

The center also offers pre-pro-
fessional advising for students
planning to study medicine, den-
tistry, or opthamology.

Also anxious to help students is
the University Counseling Center.
which offers professional coun-
seling services for personal and
vocational affairs. 'The center
maintains an up-to-date Career In-
formation Library. as well as a
graduate school advising program.

The staff includes a number‘ of
trained psychologists. a career in-
formation specialist. a graduate
school advisor. and a counselor
librarian ready to help students
with their difficulties.

While the CAS Advising Center
is mainly designed for CAS stu-
dents, the Counseling Center is
open to all, faculty, students, and
staff. '

Appointments may be made in

PHILADELPHIA (AP) — The
two biggest universities in Phil-

_Commonwealth behind Penn
State. are opting for co-ed dorms.

Temple is trying the idea out in
one high-rise dormitory. but all of
Penn's 7.500 on-campus under-
graduates are housed in co-ed dor-
initories.

"Contrary to what a lot of par-

Student Union Shuffle

Diseoneerts Pinnists  

by JAMIE KIRKWOOD

Piano practice rooms in the
Student Union, have temporarily
disappeared as part of a rear-
rangement of offices this summer.

Previously located on the first
floor. the practice rooms were
taken for staff office rooms. They
are to be moved to 515-517 SU. ’

Despite the maintenance of two
pianos in storage. the rooms are

not yet ready for use because they

have not been soundproofed.

According to Bill Markus, di-
rector of Student Activities, the
pruned University budget is the
main reason for the delay. Wheth-
er there will be sufficient finances
to support the renovations re-
mains to be seen. '

Because of the University's fi-
nancial squeeze. there have been
major budget cuts in many de-
partments. “Each director must
decide what must be cut and what
must remain. Each department
had expectations . . . each is going
to have to make new priorities."
said Markus. '

The plan is to include two prac-
tice rooms instead of one and four
pianos instead of two. The rooms
are to be carpeted and sound-
proofed. Markus said the plans
are "in the design stage now—to
see how much it‘s going to cost."

In order to end- the inconveni-
ence to students, Markus said ac-
tion is to bettaken in the next ten
days to put the pianos in their
rooms at 515-517, though car-
peting and soundproofing have not
been completed.

Markus said this action has
been delayed because of the pos-
sible conflict withother activities
on the fifth floor. Without sound-
proofing. tlie_ noise from the prac-
tice rooms may be prohibitive.

. Such organizations as With a Lit-

tle Help from Your Friends and

the YMCA. could be affected by
the piano music.

Markus expressed concern not
only for persons wanting to prac-
tice but also for the various fifth
floor student offices. Within the

"well know whether or not it's

what the cost factor is."

Markus said that if the sound

ey to soundproof the room, there
may be no practice rooms.

of prison disturbances in scatter-

_—-said’ Wednesday that some of

the trouble was linked to the

_ The Attica riot “could have

Jones in Dallas where prison-
ers in the jail atop the county
courthouse staged a two-hour
Tuprising Tuesday night.
"Authorities estimated up to
500rof the jail’s 1,600 inmates

Led by instructor Bert Rock-

theroles and attitudes of bureau-

-~ ferent countries. It is schedul-
ed for release in 1974.

The study originated at the
‘ University of Michigan and later
spread to Pitt. Pitt is the base of
operations for the portion of /the

counts of the four-day Attica riot
that ended Monday, Sept. 13,
when state troopers and other
officers rushed a cellblock held
by about 1,200 rebellious in-
mates. Ten prison employees
being held hostage by the in-
mates and 30 prisoners were
killed.

“There’s tension" in all prisons
as a result of San Quentin and
Attica,” said Allan L. Robbins,
warden of Main State Prison.

Three guards and three in-
mates were killed atthe Cali-

fornia prison Aug. 2l in what‘

officials'said was an escape
attempt by one of the victims,
Soledad Brother George Jack-
son. The family of the black

militant contends he was mur-

dered by guards. Officials say
a gun was smuggled into the
prison to Jackson and he was
shot down while attempting to

escape.

 

. Robbins said a “large major-
ity of the prison’s 330 inmates
went on a hunger strike Sunday
night demanding changes in
kitchen procedures. The peace-
ful strike ended Tuesday, Rob-
bins said, adding that some
changes will be made, including
allowing the inmates to elect
an advisory council.

At the Fulton State Hospital
in Fulton, Mo., three inmates
took a woman psychologist hos-
tage Monday, threatening to
kill her unless they were pro-
vided with a car and access to
the outside. Dr. George W.
Chase. another psychologist who
tried to come to the aid of hos-
tage Kay Mohatt, was clubbed
by the trio and killed. The in-
mates finally surrendered to_ hos-
pital officials and were charged
with first degree murder.

Dr. Donald Patterson, the
hospital supervisor, said all the
patients had access to television

_ mund Williams, the new Direc-

tor of Bands, and Robert
Kidd III, his assistant, both
from the University of Illinois.
Robert Arthur-, who retired
last year after directing Pitt’s
bands for 30 years. is now serv-
ing as consultant to the Band. _

The theme for Saturday’s game

is Good bye Summertime,
which includes the popular song,
“Rainy Days and Mondays,” Up-
coming shows will include a
salute to Louis Armstrong and
a salute to Opera.

Williams and Kidd do_ their
own arranging for the half-

interviews and written ques-
tionnaires. The data is then
prepared on punch cards and
fed into computers.

According to Carl Van Horn,
a former" member of the pro-
ject, the part that students are
playing in the Rockman study is
a sort of “sophisticated clerking
job.” The students are given an
hourly salary as renumeration
for their part in the study.

Rockman said that the study’s
purpose is to “examine the role
of elite priorities” and , to
‘identify trends and values among
elected and appointed officials.

The study is also examining
the attitudes of bureaucrats and
legislators toward each other,
their future, problems they see
emerging, and the "amount of
power they wield. This is being
accomplished through taped
interviews with individual legis-
lators and bureaucrats and also
through the use of written ques-
g tio_nn‘aires.

forms a pre-game show and
plays on the sidelines during

this year will be patterned en-
tirely by the members of the

The Band will perform at all
five home games this season and
will travel to an away game at
West Point.

The Band does not play at

‘ football games alone. The Band

Homecoming.

The Varsity Marching Band
is an all male organization—this
year, at least. According to
Williams, the Band will definite-
ly make provisions next year -to
accommodate any women who
try out for the Band.

Both Williams and Kidd say
they are very impressed by Pitt’s
Band. “This group of musicians,”
Williams declares, “is one of
the most dedicated organizations
at the University of Pittsburgh.”

According to Williams, Pitt has_

one of the finest bands in the
nation.

 Politicos’ Roles, Attitudes Studied

Rockman said that the United
States study could be released
within a year’s time; however,
the nature _of the questions,
which are open-ended and must
be compared to each other to
get any results, and the fact
that the studies of some countries
are at different stages of com-
pletion than others will delay
the release of the entire report
until 1974 at the earliest. _

and he was sure they had watch-
ed the procedings at Attica.

The first of the Attica-linked
disturbances occurred at the
Baltimore City jail less than 24
hours after the New York up-
rising was quelled.

About 200 of the prison’s
1,200 inmates hurled trays in
the cafeteria, broke windows and
tried unsuccessfully to take a
guard hostage. Police used tear
gas to break up the riot.

“To my knowledge the only
cause was the thing in Attica,"
said Deputy Warden Howard
B. Parks immediately after the

trouble. “It‘s a wonder it’s not
more widespread throughout
the country."

Elsewhere, 66 inmates of the
Federal Womens Reformatory
at Alderson, W. Va., were trans-
ferred Tuesday to a fede'ral in-
stitution for youths at Ashland,
Ky., after a four-day demonstra-

McGovern

by PATRICK A. TIERNEY, Jr.

A fund—raising picnic, a can-
vassing campaign, and the pre-
paration for the rally that will
bring their candidate to the city
are some of the activities plan-
ned by the Youth and Students
for McGovern.

Harris Miller, Western Penn-
sylvania coordinator for the
group, outlined its immediate
plans at a "general meeting of
the organization Wednesday.

The picnic will take place
Sunday, beginning at 1 p.m. in
Schenley Park. Free food and
refreshments will be offered all
those who extend donations to
the organization. Directions will
be posted throughout the Uni-
versity.

“The purpose of the picnic,”
stated Miller, “is to try to- gen-
erate some interest and esthusi-
asm for McGovern in the peo-
ple. It will give us a glimpse
as to our present strength while
at the same time presenting us
with more people who might
be interested in helping.”

The group will embark on a
canvassing campaign, slated to
begin the week after the pic-
nic. Miller said the volunteers
will have two goals in mind:
"To try to gain some financial
support for McGovern and to
inform the people ‘of the No-
vember rally.”

In addition to canvassing, the
student organization will also
distribute literature and make
as much personal contact with
the citizenry as possible.

The group will then assist the
local chapter of the Citizens for.
McGovern in organizing the
rally. Miller said the site of the
rally for the appearance of the
South Dakota Democrat is not
yet definite. He mentioned the
Syria Mosque ‘and the Carnegie
Music Hall as possible sites.

Miller said that since McGov-
ern has no huge political spon-
sor to help defray campaign
costs, his campaign requires
both "initiative” and "affirma-
tive action."

Though political pundits rate,
McGovern only ' an outside
chance at the Democratic nom-
ination for the, presidency, Mil-
ler expressed optimism at the
Sen_ator’s‘chances. _ ' -

most of those transferred “were
involved in stirring up tensions."

There were minor distur-

bances last week at two New.

to be related to tensions on the
part of guards and inmates. The
trouble occurred at Meadow

Clinton State Prison in Danne-

serious.

V Not only inmates were affected
by Attica. Off—duty guards at
the California Institution for
Men at Chino picketed Friday
to protest what a spokesman
called lenient treatment of pris-
oners. Referring to Attica, a
prison official said, “It was cer-
tainly on their minds.”

There were other disturbances
—including one in France—not im-
mediately linked to Attica by

‘ authorities.

Are Really

as sweet, right? Wrong.

We have our own brand of policeman
here at Pitt which could revolutionize the
traditional stereotype. Unless you have
the opportunity to be helped by one, you
may never see beyond the gun and blue
shirt.

With their training and psychological
screening behind them, the University of
Pittsburgh’s Campus Policemen could be

‘A working with any large metropolitan

police force if they so desired. They
would be welcome in Los Angeles. New
York, Chicago, North Philly, Selma. Cook

County, or someplace relatively tame‘

like South Park.

Some of the places mentioned resur-
rect the stereotyped, vicious image of a
barrel-chested brute with a bloody night-
stick, or worse. Maybe just the mention
of these places remind you of a certain
vice squad, narc, or tactical force.
You’ve read about it, or maybe you and a
friend have been head-cracked or gassed
in Washington.

Our Campus Policemen have passed

' up the opportunity to frighten little chil-

(lur Side’

dren, fake warrants,or play judge and
jury on-the-spot.

They’ve abandoned the rough and tough
stereotype and act as police officers.

Their role is to police university prop-
erty, provide for the security of univer-
sity students, in, and adjacent to the
campus. Because their performance on

I Prevention-Minded,

N 0t C risis-Oriented

 

There are two mistaken alternatives
you may already have about the Campus
Policemen. If you've come to Pitt from a
large. city, you might have immediately
classified them as the Typical City Cop
who eats brains for breakfast and washes
them down with a shot and a beer. Or
maybe you've passed them off mentally
as enfeebled rent-a-cops who steal cafe-
teria chairs on the side. At any rate,
they just couldn’t be for real.

But these guys in cop uniforms are
really on our side. —

Have you ever sat down and talked to
one of those guys? Most likely, one of
them is in one of your classes: Political
Science, Psychology, Speech, Police Sci-
ence, Urban Studies, in grad courses or
Law School. You‘ll find their philosophy
of law enforcement devoid of malice.
They are prevention minded. instead of
crisis-oriented.

But last Friday night‘s incidents prov-
ed that they can react quickly to any
situation, whether crisis or’ not. Having"
heard a city police monitor carry the

reggrt of a policerrian,,al,l‘_ege’d,ly

quickly responded to that report.

Although it- was. alfalse alarm, theyf‘
found a man unconscious further down _‘
‘Forbes and were faced with a crowd of:

more than 200 students and non-stir-’
dents. '

They also had to deal with drunk_s,_f
people snapping aerials off cars, and?’

fights. ‘While attempting to effect a calm-
on the crowd without'the use of mace,-P

It seems that people gut-reacted to the I 
uniform. Regardless of the “cool” with‘ 

which the campus police treat incidents,’

the high level response of those askedto V 

disperse is indicative of their -fear and
hostility toward the stereotype. 1"

Regardless of how many people are _ _
hauled to the Health Service, or given? 
-emergency medical treatment‘ by those ‘ 

who man the police vans, or howmany
typewriters, stereos and valuables -are
recovered every year, people just can’t
seem to link up the two. -

Unless you’ve been out on the street, '

late and being followed, you just won’t’
value this Campus Police Force until you
spot a foot patrolman. Maybe then you’ll

- change your mind.

At Attica, the prisoners made

"had been in charge at Attica,

would you have given in.to so
many demands?

And suppose you did grant them

er who. finances prisons? To keep
a man in prison for one year costs
more than one year here at Pitt.
Why not let the American public
decide on prison reforms?

I agree with you on one point:
There is something wrong with

the prisons today; the prisoners '

keep getting their own way. Why
not make things really tough so
one will think twice before break-
inga law? ' .
It’s too bad that only 38 out of
40 demands were granted to the
Attica prisoners. They should
have considered this “harsh" life
before they broke the law. .

‘WASHINGTON (AP) '~ Senate
‘Majority Leader Mike Mansfield
said Wednesday he is ‘hopeful
‘the House will support a new

yveelg, to set a date for total U.S.
withdrawal from Indochina.

. “The momentum is building
up,” the Montana’ Democrat told
reporters.

‘ The new amendment, expect-
ed to call for a total U.S. pull-
out in six months if American
prisoners are freed, will be of-
gfered as an amendment tothe
fmeasure authorizing funds for
Cmilitary hardware and research.

TA previous amendment, carry-
ing a nine-month deadline was
‘passed by the Senate 61 to 38
but rejected by the House.

 It was watered down in
the newly passed draft bill to
’_call on President Nixon to ne-
Ifgotiate total U.S. withdrawal as
, soon as practicable.

; Senate critics of major new
__fdefense weapons projects, mean-
-‘while, launched their annual ef-
-fort to cut the bill against the
backdrop of a widely held view
x_-that such efforts would fail

‘again.

In discussing the renewal of
the fight by Senate war foes to
~force a deadline on President
 Nixon, Mansfield said details of
3 his‘ amendment would be dis-
"  closed shortly. I

, ’ Sources said the reduction from
‘nine to six months would likely
be madebecause three months
_ have passed since the amend-
 ment was first approved. The

gMontana Democrat said the war
fremains “a front-burner issue”
rand is one of the major causes
of the nation’s current economic

problems. '

effort, due to be launched next

   

the Commonwealth to grant sal-
ary increases to faculty mem-
bers at Pennsylvania’s 14 state
colleges, Administration Secre-
tary Ronald G. Lench said Tues-
day. \

An organization representing
faculty members had asked Gov.
Shapp to intervene in the mat-
ter on the basis of merit and
longevity and in line with gen-
eral state pay increments.

“The federal guidelines for
teachers are very clear,” Lench
said. “The rules state that unless
a teacher received an increase
prior to the Aug. 15 deadline,
he is not eligible for a raise un-
til the conclusion of the freeze
period.

“No faculty members in the
state college system received a
higher pay rate before Aug. 15
because all of the increments are
granted for the Sept. 1 pay per-
iod.”

He said merit and longevity
are not allowed since the facul-
ty raises are given once a year
based on either performance or
length of service “and since the
time for these increments falls
within the time of the wage-
price freeze, they cannot be
grantedyat this time.”

Lench said increments would
be granted-Nova 13 when the
freeze is due to expire “barring
any further restrictions on the
part of the federal government."

. The annual Activities Fair
has been scheduled for Mon-
day and Tuesday, Septem-
ber 27 and 28, from 10 a.m.
to5p.m.

The Fair will Be held in
the Student Union Ballroom.
Associated Women Students

Council (MDC) V are co-spon-
soring the event, intended to

tions within the University.

   
   
  
  
  
 
 
   
   
  
   
 
 
  
   

Members of Environment: Pittsburgh at Homewood-Brushton cleanup held this summer. Business was

“picking up.”

by MICHAEL SIMON
Night Editor A

More action and less idle chat-
ter is the watchword of David.
Marshall, co-ordinator for the
newly formed Environment:
Pittsburgh ecology group.

Environment: Pittsburgh, ac-_
cording to Marshall is a diverse
group comprised of a mailing
list of 2,006 people and a paid
membership of 500, all centered
around’a nucleus of 20 workers."

Marshall, an Englishman who
came to ‘Pittsburgh in 1966, de-.\
votes full time to Environment:
Pittsburgh, a cause which he con-
siders just_as demanding as his
former interest, economics.

One of Environment: Pitts-
burgh’s first projects after its
1969 Environmental Teach-In,
was -the‘ Frick Park Clean-up.»
Marshall and his co-workers or-
ganized people from all age-
groups to literally. pick up all
of the refuse in a certain part
of Frick Park. '

Dedication was the watchword
on that rainy, cold December
morning, as all of the workers
were chilled and covered with
the» omni-present -mud. Clad in
mechanics overalls, "Marshall

. ran through the knee-deep muck, .

his red hair and beard tousled
and matted, directing the entire
operation. Chasing after Marshall
was a small but determined con-
tingent of photographers whose
spirits weren’t marred by the
mud, even though their cameras
were. “Its this kind of spirit that
getsthings done,” said Marshall.

The same “spirit” was present
at the Homewood-Brushton clean-i

‘up, in which people of not only

different backgrounds, but also
of different skin colors worked
jointly to sanitize their neigh-
borhood.

“Money is always a problem
for a non-profit organization

such as Environment: Pittsburgh. .

We get most of ours from in-
dustries, foundations and" the
Federal government; as yet, un-

. fortunately, the city is not orien-
ted towards the environment,”
'Marshallsaid.' / ’ -

Marshall listed some of the
new tasks Environment: Pitts-

'- ‘burgh is working on.

“Very shortly there is another
Homewood-Brushton clean up
on the agenda, but more impor-
tant,“ he said “there is the7riv-
ers clean up project.”

Essentially the rivers project
involves a group of students who
have been taken to various points

The samples are then analyz-
ed to test for industrial dis-
charges, and compared with
previous findings_ made by the
government or thefactories them-
selves. Any discrepancies in the
test results could result in the
revocation of that particular fac-_
tory’s permit to discharge waste
in the local waterways. Marshall
sees this effort as a means of ,
having the important ‘ Clean
Streams Law, enforced under the
Department of Environmental
Resources. ‘ _

The group has prepared a five
minute documentary, ready for
showing on local-television or
in movie theatres about the
Homewood-Brushtonproject.

Pacing about his office rapid-' _

“We are limited,.” he said,
“only by the number of people
we have to do the work. " 

For anyone 'in_terested,in par— 
ticipating in the fight against
pollution, Marshall suggested
either calling him at 422-7374, V
or coming to Environment: Pitts- 
burgh's next meeting. It will be
held at 8:00 p.m. September 30
in the third floor conference
room of the Mellon Institute.

. Gabriel,

The curtain rises on the Pitts-
burgh Playhouse‘s 1971-72 sea-
son tomorrow, with the produc-
tion of Cole "Porter's immortal
musical of the roaring twenties:
Anything Goes.

This flamboyant musical, fea-

- turing such songs as "I Get a

Kick out of You" and “Blow,
Blow” will continue
through October 16, with guest
stars Jane Coleman and Bruce
Detrick in the leading roles.
Richard Michaels, a New York
favorite, will be guest director
for this show, with Pittsburgh’s
Paul Draper handling the chor-
eography.

The Playhouse opens this sea-
son as a newly established re-
sident Equity Company, the only
one in Pennsylvania. , -

Anything Goes was given its
New York opening on November
21, 1934. The show was an en-
ormous hit and played just over
a year, for a total of 420 per-
formances. It then made along
and" triumphant tou_r. In 1936 a
“super-colossal” movie was made
of the show, with Bing Crosby as
Billy Crocker, and Ethel Mer-
man recreating her» Broadway

role as Reno Sweeney.

Still another movie version was
made of the show 20 years later,
in 1956. VA television broadcast,
following the original stage ver-
sion followed in the spring of
1954. In 1962 Anything Goes was
a hit as an off-Broadway revival
that ran for 30 weeks.

In 1937, at the peak of a dazz-
ling career. Porter's legs were

crushed in a horseback riding"

’-accident, leaving him with crip-
pling injuries that would haunt
him until his death in 1964. But
it didn’t stop him from writing
the gay songs for which he had
V become-famous.

When Porter died at‘ the age of
72——a legend in his own time-
his passing was marked by ‘glow-
ing praise from around the world.
The New York World Telegram
and Sun wrote: “His songs will
be played and sung for count-
less years to come, and the man
who wrote’ them will be grate-
fully and affectionately remem-
bered for his talent, originality
and taste.” The longevity of
Anything Goes is indeed an ex-

I ample that he has been.

Those of us who were able to
follow Maestro Szell’s years

(and were able to hear the Cle-

some years ago over a local sta-

tion) certainly realize what a
fine "instrument" he shaped,
making Cleveland's Orchestra

one of the world’s finest. V

There is certainly an empti-
ness in the nation's cultural life
following Dr. Szell’s death.
Even so, Columbia is continu-

cordings the maestro cut shortly
before his passing. What finer
tribute could be paid -to the

memory of a great man?

But the film’s real failures» are
. the clowns themselves. They sim-
ply aren’t funny. I saw the film at
the Guild Theater on a Saturday
afternoon and ‘there were many
children in the audience. None of
them laughed at all. The young-
sters seated behind me asked to
be taken home several times. "I
am disappointed too," replied
their weary mother, “but we will
stay."

Some people raised in the Euro-
pean circus tradition have told me
that they found the clowns faith-
ful to their childhood memories- I
take the position that the reason
neither the children nor myself
found these performers amusing
is not simply a culture gap—but
bad performers and miscalcula-
tion on the part of Fellini.

What distinguishes a great
clown is not his gags, most of
which probably bored Aristo-
phanes, but the timing and phy-
sical grace with which he exe-
cutes them. Fellini has given the
task of re-creating performances
of master clowns to a new stum-
blebums, who approach physical
comedy like National Guards-
men storming Attica prison, con-
sequently slaughtering every joke
in sight. If the originals were this
‘bad, it is no wonder that people
forgot how to laugh.

Thenithere is the problem of
make-up. In the middle of center
ring it heightens the clowns fa-
cial expression, but_ in full color
screen close-up reduces him to a
gargoyle. There was one amusing
routine involving two clowns who
played trumpet
chairs out from under each other.
The performers actually had
some talent, the camera was
placed far enough away so that
we could watch them move around
and their act was jazzed up with
jump cuts making them funnier.
Fellini managed to scratch even
this minor gem by constantly cut-
ting to a clown literally dying in
the audience. '

The point. that life imitates the ,

circus or vice versa. is as banal
as Nino Rota’s score——unless your
musical taste runs to Fascination
and Ebb. Tide. There is excellent
color photography, set and cos-
tume design. There is also the
most magnificent series of visual
images in recent memory. Unfor-
tunately they ‘signify nothing
more than the decline of genius.

Drive, He Said is not only a story about a college
basketball player caught between the visions of
either becoming super—jock or an anti-establish-
ment member of a guerilla theater, but in some
ways it is a story involving us all. A

Each of us is faced with extremes of choices in
our lives, and often we have a painful time choos-
ing which way to go. Such is the caseiof Hector
Bloom.

Hector faces a conflict of these proportions.
Should he join the turned-on, anti-societal.frame-
work set up for him by his strung-out roommate,
Gabe, or should he accept a draft to play profes-
sional basketball? Both ' represent different
ends of the spectrum, yet both hold their attractions.

He-is torn between the love of a game, the love‘

of a friend, and is confused about the place of both
in his life. His roommate looks at the sport as only
"staying after school in his underwear." and he
looks at it as poetry.

Drive is full of painful reality, and director Jack,

Nicholson, along with writer Jeremy Larner, don’t
miss any tricks when it comes to filling out fear and
hopelessness and for the male viewer, the threat of
castration in a demanding society.

William Tepper as Bloom, Michael Marcotta as
Gabe the roommate, and Karen Black, veteran of

Five Easy Pieces as Olive, superbly confront you I

with the anxieties and frustrations in their tangled

The film covers many aspects of personal con-
flict, including sexual insecurities, the locker-room

‘crudeness of teammates, and the general disen-

chantment that comes about simply by living every
day. No one could possibly sit there and find nothing
to relate to if he is totally honest with himself.

able to bring humor to Till Eu-

Although my taste for Strauss
is not as advanced as most, my
praise for this recording is lav-
ish. It is a definitive example
of German programme music of
the late nineteenth century and,-
besides, the price of this bud-

Szell's genius was certainly of
the most prolific type. He was

score. Besides being" a gifted
conductor and pianist; he was »
a gentleman endowed with
grace and wit.

Of him it was said, “He built’

best." These two recordings cer-

tainly attest to this fact without ,
any doubt. -

hasn't even sent much of a shockwave throughout
the States yet.

However, the Europeans probably didn’t like it
because they couldn’.t relate to it to the extent an
American audience potentially could since it dealt
with problems primary indigenous to our culture
and not theirs.

But the photography itself should have been
enough to at least raise. a French eyebrow and

,The love or sex scenes are so emotionally real-
istic they almost seem an intrusion into somebody’s
life. ‘'Maybe,’’ you think, “I should just sneak out
before they notice me?” ‘

The scene where Gabe totally loses his mind on
drugs and lets all the rodents and mice and gila
monsters and cockroaches out of the biology lab is
so frighteningly absorbing that you feel as if you are
standing there with him, and are as naked.

It is like a bad dream crammed with a thousand
Freudian implications. You are repulsed, but you
stay and sit through every agonizing moment of
Gabe’s final detachment from. “reality." All you
can do is helplessly watch the snakes crawl over his
arms, the serpents slithering across the tables. the
mice colliding into a very .confused turtle.

Olive’s comment, “I am not going anywhere with

anybody. I’m me,“ sums up the fears and problems
of each character. Gabe‘s intense fear of the draft,
Hector’s fear of the future, her fear of ‘choosing the
proper companion. I

Don’t expect to go to this film for a laugh or a
light evening’s entertainment.'Don’t expect to for-
get your problems, because it will quickly remind
you of a few you even forgot that you had. It will
terrify you, and it will attract you, and it won’t
give you any answers. I .

It is a good film, however, and one that will stick
in your mind long after you walk out into the night,
and perhaps it will help you see other things more
clearly for the effort.

Two years ago, the Oklahoma
Sooners romped over the Pitt
Panther 37-8 in Coach Carl De-
Pasqua's first season at Pitt.

During the interim, the Pan-
thers have improved I tremen-
dously, and they'll get their

chance for belated revenge to-
morrow afternoon at the Stadium
at 1:30.

The Sooners will present the
Panthers‘ with their second
straight highly regarded oppon-
ent as OU is currently ranked
eleventh in the country. Last"
week, they displayed their mus-
cle in a driving rainstorm at
Norman, Oklahoma by whipping
SMU, 30-0.

This will be the eighth meet-
ing between the schools with
Pitt winning only one and ty-
ing one in a series started in
1952.

Oklahoma Coach Chuck Fair-
banks admits that the major por-
tion of the offensive attack will
be their running.

“We are a running football
team," he stated. “That’s the
th_i_n’g we do best.”

Panther football fans have a
double treat in store for them to-
morrow——not only will the Cats
be kicking off their season on
the home front against Okla-
homa, but the Pitt freshman
football squad will be opening
their season against West Vir-
ginia at ‘8:15 p.m. at Ambridge
Area High School Stadium.

Proceeds from the frosh con-
test wili be divided by the Bea-
ver County‘ Council of Lions
Clubs and the Southwestern

. Pennsylvania Economic Develop-
ment District (SPEDD). _It will.

be used to aid the blind and to

implement the _ Appalachian
Youth Leadership Project.
“I don’t know that much

about West Virginia,” said Cub
coach Bill Quinter, "But from
what I hear, they have a big
line and quick backs.

“Some of those West Virginia
freshman we‘ tried to recruit-
they’re good players,” stated
Quinter. ’

Quinter refrains from making
any predictions about the per-
formance of his players against
WVU other than a normal de-
sire to go onto the football field
and win. « '

“I wouldn’t want to make a
guess as to how any one player
will perform against West Vir-
ginia," related the frosh coach.
"You set up an offense anda de-
‘tense and hope you win foot-
ball games.

“There’s not really anybody
that has stood out during prac-
tices,” continued Quinter. “All
the players are working hard and
all are learning the fundament-
als.”

Starting for the Cubs at the
quarterback position is Bill Dan-
iels from Montour High School.

“Bill has performed the best
‘of all the freshman quarterbacks
as far as the running and passing
game -goes,” ‘related Quinter.

ports

Wylie and Greg Pruit both aver-
aged over five yards per carry
last year, with Wylie gaining
close to 1,000 total yards.

Fullback Leon Crosswhite,
who only started half of the

Sooners’ games last fall, netted

almost 600 yards rushing.

Finally, Quarterback Jack
Mildren, who directs the power-
ful Wishbone-T offense, has
excelled for the past two sea-
sons and has drawn the praise
of many opposing coaches. He

gained over 100 yards _last week ,

to lead the team.

DePasqua emphasized their
quickness. "They have great
speed. and they can sustain of-
fensive drives for 17-18 plays
at "a time." he said. "They can
run six ways on either side of
their Wishbone, but it’s their
personnel in the line that make
them work." ‘

Leading their defensive charge
will be Ray Hamilton, who re-
ceived the honor of Lineman of
the Week from the AP. The jun-
ior defensive end is OU’s best
pass rusher and is considered an
All-American candidate.

“Defensivelyv they are big and
strong and can make adjust-
ments,” commented DePasqua.
"Without a doubt, it will be
one of our tougher ball games.”

According to Fairbanks, the
Sooners emerged unscathed in-

 

jury-wise from the SMU romp;

_"although we really didn't get

tested in that game."

Because of the two week lay-
off, only one Panther will be
out of the starting lineup. John
Simpson, who suffered a shoul-
der separation against UCLA,
will be on the sidelines for
this one. The other injured play-
ers had a chance to recover.

Dave Blandino. who excelled
at offensive tackle at UCLA, is
a doubtful starter due to a leg
injury-from practice this week.

If he is not ready, Dave‘, Wann-.

stadt will replace him.

Dan Lynn ‘and Steve Moyer,
both injured against the Bruins
will be in the lineup tomorrow.
Both have responded to treat-
ment well in the past two weeks.

V Since both John Hogan and Dave
Havern guided the team wel_l
in the UCLA victory, DePasqua
is uncertain of his starter. 

Fairbanks praised both Pitt
quarterbacks after reviewing
the game, films. “I think that
they are both very fine play-
ers although Havern looked a
little better," he said. ,

Oklahoma's kicking game is
handled by two players from the

offense instead of specialists.
Wylie. handles the punting,
while John Carroll, a reserve

split end kicks field goals and
PAT’s. Against SMU, he booted
three FG’s, including a 46
yarder.,

Two years ago, Fairbanks’
impression of the Pitt squad was
that they “were not a neces-
sarily active team. Now, he has
changed his mind to “Pitt can
play against anybody in the

country and do well.”

The Pitt road racing team will

the Camaro in another race this
weekend at Warren. Ohio.

For the past six weeks the Pitt

they competed last weekend. the

Head Mechanic Frank Rescini-

said, “The car is coming along
pretty good,” in response to a
question concerning the mechani-
cal condition of the car for this
week’s race. “We have disman-
tled it completely and are having
critical parts of the car x-rayed
and magnetically examined for
any weaknesses.”-

All parts which do not meet
specifications will be replaced. It
is hoped by the crew that failures
