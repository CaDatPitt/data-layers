University of Pittsburgh

for Shakespeare Festival

By Jennifer Alpha
For T he'Pitt News

An end to an era in
Pitt’s theater arts history
came with the decision
last week to discontinue
the Three Rivers
Shakespeare Festival.

After -much debate
over the festival’s direc-
tion the department of
theater arts announced
the decision last
Wednesday, bringing’ an
end to the festival’s 16-
year run.

“It came down to the

choice of ‘Do we think
this entity and all the
energy and resources it
takes is giving the
department enough back
to support it?’” said ,W.
Stephen Coleman, chair
of the -theater arts
department. “The facul-
ty decided it wasn’t 
and as the provost’s
office and dean’s. office
rightly’ identified, with-

out the support of the_

department, it’s hard to
run a theater operation.”

The mission of the
festival was to mirror

the academic purpose of
the department.
Recently, there had been
much debate about the
festival’s artistic and
academic accomplish-
ments.

The lack of unanimity
within the department
made it evident that
there were simpler, less
expensive ways tomeet
the needs of the depart-
ment, especially during
this time of lacking

resources, Coleman
said.

O'Connor
gets a job

By Kathleen Scanlon
News Editor

Former Chancellor J. Dennis O’Connor
will take a job with the Smithsonian
Institute next year, leaving behind a sever-
ance package that would have given him a
yearly salary of $177,200 to teach biology
at Pitt.

O’Connor will begin his job as provost of
the Smithsonian on Jan. 1, 1996 and will
oversee the Institute’s programs in terms of
exhibitions, research and education, accord-
ing to a spokesperson for the Smithsonian.

Members of the university community
have applauded the transition.

“This is a good resolution of this chapter
in the university’s history,” said Ken
Service, director of communications. “It’s
good for Dr. O’Connor and it’s good for the
university.” _

The salary that the trustees promised
O’Connor, which was contingent on his
return to the classroom, caused a stir this
summer. James Holland, former president
of the University Senate, called the salary
“outrageous.” It was roughly $100,000
more than the average salary of professors
in the natural sciences department.

O’Connor’s decision to leave Pitt did not
come unexpectedly. He had discussed this
possible move with administrators at the
Smithsonian for the past few months,
according to Service.

“In the sense that he was looking for
another job — that’s not a surprise,” he
said.

O’Connor’s experience as administrator
and scientist qualiﬁes him for the newly-
created position of provost, said Linda St.
Thomas, spokesperson for the Smithsonian.

“He’s a biologist and an administrator,
and a great part of the Smithsonian is dedi-
cated to science,” St. Thomas said.

The secretary, who was appointed in
September 1994, created the position as
part of a restructuring of the administration.
Previously, the undersecretary took care of
O’Connor’s new responsibilities, as well as
finances, St. Thomas said. '

The undersecretary, a position parallel to
provost, will now concentrate on the day-
to-day operations and administration of the

Comedy marathon benefits AIDS task force

By Melissa Pearlman
For The Pitt News

“This is the Mortal Combat
of Improv, and weall must be
wired on caffeine and nicotine
to stay awake,” says Chick
Leiby, after the first hour of

Improv-A-Thon ‘95 had past.

“One down and twenty—three
to go!” he shouts to the audi-
ence, which responds to the
comment with immense
applause.

For the second year in a row,
Improv-A-Thon ‘95 was
underway last Friday night at

the Pit Theatre in Oakland.
This year the 24-hour event
sen-t all proceeds to the
Pittsburgh Aids Task Force.
Starting at 11 p.m. Friday
night and running until 11 p.m.
Saturday, the evening was

packed with events ranging

from audience-participation
theater games, a date auction
and impersonations to local
comedians, musicians and
clowns. Local bands such as
Begger Man Thief and
Blindsight were also on hand.
Improv-A-Thon was spon-
sored by a variety of local

businesses that helped provide
free food and drink during the
entire 24 hours, and a raffle
that included over thirty
prizes.

With over 100 people in
attendance, the event was
kicked off by the master of
ceremonies, Chick Leiby.

“I guess my main job is just
to keep everyone else awake
—mainly to keep going and
keep laughing,” Leiby said in
between acts. Leiby, an
English major at Pitt, has been

' involved with the Improv for

the past six years.

Starting with his diagram of
the eight rules for a successful
Improv, Leiby had the crowd
roaring in laughter. Beginning
with the FIOK rule, which
stands for Failure Is OK, and
ending with the Wang Chung
rule, meaning everybody have
fun tonight, Leiby set out to
convey an atmosphere where
everyone would feel comfort-
able.

“Even if you bomb up there,
clapping and cheering is a
must, and no booing,” Leiby
explained.

°From page 1

The festival’s future began
to be questioned in the mid-
dle of the 1995 season,
when deficits began to soar.

Financial problems
stemmed from a lack of
aggressive fundraising and a
weak marketing strategy that
was not keeping up ticket
sales, said Saul Straussman,
former managing director
for the festival.

“[But] finances were not
what brought the festival
down,” Straussman said.
“Financially, it could have
been put back on its feet.”

These financial issues,
however, brought philosoph-
ical questions about the fes-
tival into focus.

Members of the depart-
ment had to ask themselves,
“even if ‘it restructures
financially, will it serve us
inthe way we want it to
serve us?” Coleman said.

Many Pitt students were
hired in technical support
positions for the festival, but
the department felt there
were notenough opportuni-
ties for students to hold cre-
ative positions.

Members of the depart-
ment said they hoped to use
the festival’s professional
environment to advane its
academic desires to train
actors, directors, designers
and dramaturges. To do this,
a special chemistry is neces-
sary. .
“There is a special kind of
synergy that exists between
them that is mutually benefi-
cial,” Coleman said. ‘The

festival was taking on an ,

identity~of its own that was
moving away from Pitt’s
academic needs. Even if _ the
festival would succeed both
academically and artistical-

ly, we still don’t have any -

guarantee that this synergy
will be realized.”

Straussman said the festi-"

val’s closing will hurt; the
arts community, especially
in the summer months when
about 10,000 people would
attend the festival.

Coleman said he agrees
this decision will definitely
be a blow to the arts com-
munity, though it is not an
unrecoverable one.

More Shakespeare will be
incorporated into Pitt theater
during the academic year,
Coleman said. He hopes that

other theaters will do the“

same.

The department will also

continue its Shakespeare in
the Schools program, when
Pitt theater students perform
in area schools.

Coleman also hopes that
area theaters will recognize
the talent pool of students
available in Pitt’s theater
department and tap this
resource, giving students the

experience they might have.

gained by working with the
festival.

It’s not to be forgotten that
the festival was a glorious

part of the.department’_s__ his- _

tory, Coleman said, but fac-
ulty will now be looking to
design new programs that

will better serve the mission ‘

of the department.

Coleman said members of
the department do not want
to rush the search for new
programs, however.

“We want to take our time

and come up with something

that we were looking for the
festival to do,” Coleman
said.

O’Connor also described
how his position will help carry
out the vision of the institu-
tion’s secretary. The secretary
has said that the Smithsonian

must become more accessible-

to people who carmot travel to
Washington, D.C.

“Since everyone cannot come
to the Mall, one of my respon-
sibilities will be to see to it that
our boundaries are co-terminus
with the nation’s boundaries,”
O’Connor said. —

The secretary has already
begun to institute this vision.
Currently, a travelling exhibi-
tion is going around the country
and a home page has been put
out on the Internet, St. Thomas
said. '

The Smithsonian, the world’s
largest combined museum and

research complex, encompasses

Impro
0From page 1

Leiby’s first audience-par-
ticipation game was called
“Tag Team.” Two people are
instructed to act out a particu-
lar scene chosen by an audi~
ence member, while two other
people are onstage to shout
out the first word that comes
to mind. The word which is
called out has to be incorpo-

I rated into the scene.

“Audience participation is

in the best part of Improv,” said

Jan Minos, a junior at Pitt.
Minos participated in the
game “Toys.”

In this game, audience
members take turns running
onto the stage and acting out a
short scene with a prop. They
continue the sceneiuntil the
next person shouts freeze, and
that person begins their scene.

“It gets pretty crazy out
there sometimes, but it is all
about having fun,” Minos
said.

Jamie Troil, a freshman at

-Pitt who has attended Friday

Night Improvs, said it’s “won-
derful to see people using
their free time so that others
can have a great time for a
great cause.”

This year’s cause happens
to be The Pittsburgh AIDS
Task Force, signified by an
AIDS awareness ribbon that
everyone received upon enter-
ing the door.

“I feel like I’m at the
Oscars,” Leiby said. “In all
actuality, the task force is a
worthy organization and
deserves everyone’s help.”

Improv—A-Thon originated
from the Friday Night
Improvs which have been
going on at Pitt for the past
eight years.

“Last year we planned it in
three weeks and we were
scrounging for acts.” Leiby
said. “This year we were
overbooked.”

Leiby said that he could not
have done it alone. He said he
relied daily on his colleagues
Louis Stein. Steven Werber
and Amanda Cohen, each of
whom were active partici-
pants in the event. To keep
morale high throughout the
night, Leiby referred to the
countdown sign that was
brought on stage each hour.

The cost of the event was
$6. By the end of hour two,
Leiby,‘ with his jacket off and
tie loosened, said that “laugh—
ter and fun is the name of the
game and that is what we are
all here for.”

  Opinions
Money managing 101

Congratulations to the theater arts department for making a
very difficult decision. The department announced last week
that the Three Rivers Shakespeare Festival would no longer be
held after this year. '

The tight condition of the university’s budget led the theater
arts department to reevaluate the role of the festival. The origi-
nal purpose of the festival was to reflect the academic role of
the department, and provide a way to give young theater stu-
dents a way to gain valuable experience.

' The decision to cut the festival came, however, when the
department determined the festival was no longer serving that.
intended purpose. Students were given little chance of gaining
the experience when the major roles (both on and off-stage)
were becoming more and more professional.

It is a shame to see such a valuable aspect of Pittsburgh’s cul-
tural forum come to an end. The Shakespeare Festival drew
thousands to Pittsburgh and exposed many to a cultural element ,
they might not have been able to experience if the festival had
not provided the opportunity.

However, it is commendable that the theater arts department
took the initiative to make such a difficult decision. This is a"
perfect ‘example of a department which has made an attempt to
remedy its budget problems while still looking out for the best
interests of its students. Hopefully, some philanthropist will
endow the money needed to keep the Shakespeare Festival
aliveindependent of the university. But even if not, the theater
arts department has set an example every department should
follow.

A failing grade

- When was the last time you spent a lot of money on some-
thing and, only after you had it, you found out it wasn’t the
right thing? Usually, our mistakes can be returned, or at ‘least
rationalized because it might not have been that much money
after all. But what happens when that mistake has a price tag of
$147.-million? It’s a bit difficult to rationalize away that much
money. And unfortunately, in the case of this particular mis-
take, you can’t get a refund.

In case you were wondering, we’re talking about Hotel
Alcatraz, which now graces the banks of the Monongahela
River. The property alone which is home to this architectural
nightmare is worth a small fortune of taxpayer money. Despite
the luxurious full-sized gym and athletic facilities, carpeting
and cable, there are a few problems with the new hotel (ahem,
make that prison.)

After spending so much money on the new facility, you might
think they would have built it right the first time. But no. (It’s
not theirmoney, after all.) There have already been accidental
early releases because the $770,000 computer "information sys-
tem is not functioning properly. The structural defects of the
new jail are to numerous to list here. There have been several
attempted escapes, and security is questionable at best.

' The costs to taxpayers have already exceeded astronomical
proportions, and it is going to get worse. Maybe Mayor Murphy
_ needs to take a few lessons from the theater arts department.

It's Cl sha

Adam I major-
Schlismann ity of
American
voters have been looking
eagerly to the future in antic-
ipation of November 6, 1996.
On that day, some heroic
Republican will rise up like a
crusading knight of old to
slay the chaotic liberalism of
the Clinton administration
and restore the enlightened
policies of his predecessors.
Conservatives have been
peering at the horizon for
many months now, hoping to
catch a first glimpse of their
prospective champions
charging forth in shining
armor.

Recently, it has finally
become apparent who the
leading contenders are to

' capture the nomination and

unseat Clinton. These bold,
charismatic men on whom
the hope of millions ride are
none" other than  Phil
Gramm and Bob Dole. One
can almost hear the cheers
from the White House at the
prospect of Clinton getting
the opportunity to run
against one of these drab,
uninspiring men. The
President’s best hope for re-
election is that the GOP will
nominate a mediocre candi-
date to oppose him, and
apparently the Republicans
are willing to do him the
favor.

Gramm and Dole are inter-
esting as rivals because they
each lack what the other has.
Gramm is an uncompromis-
ing ideologue who makes
sure that conservatives know
he is one of them. He is

, struggling to portray himself

as a Ronald Reagan for the
‘90s. However, there is a
crucial difference between
the two: people actually
liked Reagan. Gramm has all
the charisma and likability of
a menopausal rottweiler. His
media-unfriendly image
appears to be his biggest
obstacle to his presidential

me they‘

ambitions. Even those
inclined to vote for a conser-
vative seem put off by his
Jethro Clampett accent and
lack of humor; and a bald
man hasn’t won a presiden-
tial election since before
television. Despite a cam-
paign fund of millions and
beliefs that most Republican
voters should identify with.
Gramm has the support of a
mere six percent. of
Republicans, well behind

Dole (38%) and even Pat

Buchanan (9%).

Bob Dole has never had
the type of personal image
problem that Gramm suffers
from. He has the kind of
resume that most politicians
can only dream of: he was
raised in a farming commu-
nity in Middle America. was
wounded in battle during
World War II and has served
honorably and well in both
houses of Congress. Yet Dole
is hampered by a problem
that stems from his ‘success
as a senator. Over the years,
the compromises and deals
that any legislato.r must make
have made his credentials as
a conservative rather suspect
among many Republicans.
He is especially distrusted by
the so-called Christian right,
who charge him with waver-
ing on such hot-button issues
as abortion ‘and welfare
reform. Dole is very much
like George Bush. They are
both fairly conservative, but
make right—wing voters ner-
vous with their willingness
to compromise.

In fact. Dole and Clinton
share the problem of being
unable to convince people
that they will stand firm on
principle if really pressured.
Clinton’s policy reversals
and cave-ins are so well-
known that they don’t
require listing. Dole’s, while
not so numerous or outra-
geous, nonetheless dampen
his credibility. Unlike most
of the other GOP candidates,
Dole isn’t _known for his

re Right

stand on any one popular
issue the way that Gramm is
on the deficit or Pete Wilson
is on immigration..Dole’s
high_poll ratings don’t mean
much. For now, he is the
best-known candidate, and
people support him for lack
of a better alternative.
However, his poll numbers
will sink like a stone as the
more issue-oriented
Republican candidates attract
some of the media spotlight.

So who does this leave as
the white knight who will
rescue America from the
Clinton administration?
Unfortunately, nobody as of
yet. There are some intrigu-
ing candidates in the field,
such as Alan Keyes, Richard
Lugar, and even our own
Arlen Specter. Unfortunately.
in a nation of voters too lazy
to research the candidates for
themselves, obscene amounts
of money are needed for the
candidates to by the air time
necessary to deliver their
propaganda to the people.
Gramm and Dole may be
seriously flawed candidates.
but they sure do have more
rich friends than those run-
ning against them.

So don’t bet on anyone
else seriously challenging for
the GOP nomination. One of
these men will capture (or
buy) the nomination and face
Clinton in the general elec-
tion. Remember that Clinton,
though a bad president. is a
great politician. Remember
that in 1992 he masterfully
downplayed his own flaws
while highlighting those of
George Bush. And keep in
mind that Dole is in many
ways the second coming of
Bush, while Gramm’s abra-
sive and uninspiring persona
would play into the hands of
those who stereotype
Republicans as mean, heart-
less rich men. America, be
prepared for four more years.

The Pitt Panther football team simply gave the
Texas Longhorns too many chances in a disap-
pointing 38-27 loss Saturday in Austin.

The Panthers (2-1) led the undefeated
Longhorns 27:24 with only 9:06 remaining while
battling the llO—degree heat on the field.

“The heat played a factor, but not.a major fac-
tor. We knew it was going to be hot like this and
we trained for it,”/ cornerback-Thad Culpepper

Culpepper filled in for Anthony Dorsett, who
was suffering leg cramps for most of the second
half. Cramps plagued several Panthers through-
out the game. , ' N

"We battled through the heat. We played a real-
ly tough game," Culpepper said.

The coaches agreed.

“We coaches" felt with the utmost confidence
that our players would go out there and play their
hardest,” head coach Johnny Majors said. “It’s
tough to lose a game like this.”

The loss was definitely a tough one for the
Panthers, who have no one to blame but them-
selves.

tions, including three in the fourth quarter. James
“Superbad” Brown, the Texas quarterback, did

talized. '

QB John Ryan threw five interceptions Saturday against Texas.
Four of his interceptions came in the second half. Ryan completed 16 of 35

“I can remember at least three occasions where Passes for 206 yards and ‘me touchdown‘

we were unable to put the ball in the end zone,”
Majors said. _ \
The mistakes in this game started early. On the

Longhorns’ first possession, Brown was sacked by Pitt’

lineman Jared Miller. Brown fumbled and Mike Halapin
recovered for the Panthers on the Texas 28 yard line.
Thanks to a delay of game penalty on a fourth—and-12
play, a play completed for a first down to wide-out Sadiq
Durham, the Panthers were forced to punt. V.
On Pitt’s next drive, keyed by a 47-yard completion to
Durham, Ryan found Dietrich Jells in the end zone with
3:01 left in the quarter to give Pitt a 7-0 lead. Jells finished

scamper by Shoﬁ Mitchell to knot the score at 7.

With 14:22 remaining in the first half, Pitt embarked on
its most impressive drive of the season. On a 21-play, 83-
yard drive that engulfed 10:32 off of the clock, Pitt mus-
tered up a measly 22-yard field goal by Chris Ferencik. Pitt
led 10-7. »

With 1:16 remaining in the half, Texas launched a 72-
yard drive in just 58 seconds to give Texas a 14-10 half-
time lead. «

Pitt was to kick off to the Longhorns to open the second
half, and people could feel a route coming on. People for-

Men's, women's cross country finish second

Nesko, Kuntz
lead men with
second and third
place finishes

By John Miller
For the Pitt News

On a beautiful day for a cross coun-
try meet, Pitt finished second in both
the men’s and women’s races held
Saturday at Schenley Park.

Frank Nesko finished second in the
race, with a time of 25:29, behind
Matt Byrne of St. Joseph’s. Byrne ran
the five-mile race with a time of
24:57. .

St. Joseph’s won the meet with 25
points. Pitt finished a close second
with 32 points and Robert Morris
rounded out the field with 85 points.

Pitt’s Dennis Kuntz finished third in

the race with a time of 26:00. Matt
Samuel finished sixth while Julio
Ortiz finished 10th. Ed Adamson fin-

ished right behind Ortiz for 11th‘

place.

“I had an off-par day,” Nesko said.
“I never really got into it and didn’t
really want to be here today.”

The hilly course took its effect on
the Pitt squad.

“If your not 100 percent, it just kills
you. With us being tired, it took a 1’it—
tle bit too much out of us today,”
Kuntz said.

Coach Dave Sobal said, “Everybody
was a little slower and I think that
just reflects the toughness of the
course.” .

Sobal said the men’s team was not
100 percent, and one of their top five
runners couldn’t run. Adamson also
just returned and is still not 100 per-
cent.

‘_‘Julio was able to run fairly well.”
Sobal said. “He’s limping a little bit,
but I think he’ll be OK by the time we
really need_him, late in October.”

The women’s team finished second

with 48 points. St. Joseph’s took first
with just 15 points. Duquesne and
Robert Morris took the final two spots
with 96 and 108 points.

Although Stacey Anderson was
injured, she came in sixth place with
a time of 19:10. “When going up
hills, my foot is bothering me because
I have tendinitis,” she said. St.
Joseph’s runners took the top five
places.

Amy Francy came in ninth with
19:29, whi1e.Stephanie Ellsworth
came in 10th in 19:48.

“We weren’t 100 percent,” Sobal
said. “We were missing one [of their
captains]. Stacey has a minor foot
problem, and that holds her back,
especially‘ when running up hills."

Considering this, Sobal was happy
with their performance.

“I think some of them that didn’t
run last week showed what they can
do. They’re coming along and they’re
going to get better.
