Thornburgh BeotsF|oherty in Gubernatorial Race,

A jubilant Richard Thornburgh last night at the William (Penn
Hotel, downtown. A heavy. Republican turnout and many
Democratic crossover votes in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh
gave Thornburgh an upset victory over former Pittsburgh
mayor Peter Flaherty. ' .

Republican Richard L. Thornburgh, who trailed Democrat
Pete Flaherty in the—polls throughout the campaign, pulled
ahead at the wire to become the 42nd governor of
Pennsylvania last night.

The race was over at 10:30 p.m. when Flaherty conceded
defeat in a phone call to Thornburgh. ‘

“I thanked him for his generosity in ‘calling me and

congratulated him on waging a first-class campaign.,”,

Thornburgh told an exuberant crowd of supporters gathered
in the ballroom on the 17th floor of the William Penn Hotel in
Pittsburgh. '

“As many of you know, my opponent and I have known
each other for many years. . In some ways it's very difficult to
wage a campaign against someone you have had and hope to
continue to have as a friend,” Thornburgh added. “But I
think our campaigns were conducted in a way that reﬂects
credit on the political process and on Pennsylvania.”

With 91 percent of the 9,579 precincts in Pennsylvania
already reporting, Thornburgh had 1,796,378 votes while
Those ﬁgures show

Thornburgh with a substantial lead of 53.3 percent ‘in
comparison to Flaherty’s 46.1 percent.
Thornburgh recalled a newspaper column as the sign that-
told him that he would win. .
“I remember especially a column in the Philadelphia Daily‘

Action in Philadelphia. . .who characterized Dick Thornburgh
as an inept politician,” he said during his victory speech. “I
knew we were going to win then!”

Flaherty, who-«seemed near tears during his concession
speech, said Pennsylvanians apparently believed‘ Thorn-
burgh offered more of a change in state government than he
did. - »

“The people of Pennsylvania wanted a change. ‘ They
apparently believed my opponent would bring about greater’ 3
change, perhaps greater than they thought I could, ” Flaherty
told a crowd of_supporters in the ﬁrst ﬂoor Terrace‘ Room of
the William Penn Hotel. I v

“I did my best. Iran the campaign as I saw ﬁt. I accept the
full responsibility and offer no excuses,”Flaherty said. O

Student Activities Office Director
Resigns to SeekJob Opportunities

By RODNEY B. GRIFFITH , i
Pitt News Staff Writer
’Willard “Bud” Heaps, director, of
the Ofﬁce of Student Activities,
announced yesterday that he has

resigned his position; and plans to

seek a job either with another college

for university or outside of higher

education. ' .

“I have fora long time thought
of other career plans ‘and‘aspira-
tions,” Heaps said. “Other
opportunities have become avail-

‘able, and I can’t pass up the

chance.” _

Heap_said he had talked with his
family and his supervisor William
Markus, vice chancellor for student
affairs before making his decision.
He said he had three major
positions he was considering.

Markus said ' he would accept
I-I.eap’s resignation, and was now
concerned with steps to keep the
student activities ofﬁce running ‘on

an interim and permanent basis.
Markus added that selection of
any new student activities director
would involve a screening ‘process
that would include students‘. “The

appointment is onewhere-'1 wish to '

seek student counsel before selec-
tion,” Markus said.

Markus ‘outlined a series of 4

qualiﬁcations lie wantsto see in the
new director of the Ofﬁce of Student
Affairs. The qualiﬁcations included

.prior experience and training, at

least a master's degree, enormous
physical energy, administrative and
managerial skills and the ability to
work with people. ’

One ‘quality that Markus hoped
the new director would have was
experience at an urban college or
university, but he said it was not a
necessary qualiﬁcation. ,

* Student Government ‘ Board,

President Josh Baylson, who said
he was surprised by the resigna-

‘ ‘I think Bud did a‘ very good job.
He very deﬁnitely set goals for the

ofﬁce andhimself and-‘he reached’ 1 ‘

them_,”‘ B_aylson said. “He de-
serves a lot of credit for that.”
Baylson said‘ he hoped that the_
new director, would be able to work
well with studentsand be energetic
and innovative. -“It’s obvious that

the person has to have managerial,

skills, ‘but he also has to be"
someone ’ with ingenuity and
imagination.” .

Heaps will remain with the ofﬁce
until Friday and during that time.
Markus said he would consult.

in the student activities ofﬁce so he .

Posvar Reports Cutbocks Due to Decreosed‘Enro||ment ~ A

' By MARGI STUMPF
Pitt News Staff Writer .
Chancellor Posvar reported at
Monday’s University Senate Coun-
cil meeting that cutbacks will have
to be made in the University
budget to accomodate an approx-
imately 3 percent‘ drop in. enroll-
ment.

A decrease of nearly 1,000

. students has created “budgetary

difficulties,” Posvar said, and the
University has been forced to
examine this year’s budget to “see
where we can economize.”

The largest drop in enrollment
was experienced in the school of
general studies, with drops seen
also'in the school of engineering.
Additionally, there has been an
increase in the number of students
who “step out” of the University
for a period of time, Posvar added.

The chancellor attributed part of
the decrease to the depressed-
economy of the state, the state’s

“low per capita support for higher .

education” and the subsequent
“level of tuition forced upon us.”
“There are difﬁcult measures to

be taken, but they ‘are measures
that will not cut into the heart of
our programs unless we rearrange
our priorities (in some areas),”
Posvar stated. "

Posvar said he will meet with
University administrators to deter-
mine exactly where cutbacks in the
budget will be made.

In other business, ‘the senate
council endorsed a recommend-
ation by its special committee on
undergraduate advising to esta-
blish an information and referral
center on campus.

' The center would “assist stu-
dents and others to understand
University services, policies and
procedures in order to minimize
confusion and waste and mazimize
productive use of University
services, offices and personnel,"
according to a senate council
Student Affairs Committee report
made in March, 1976, which
springboarded theiformation of the
special committee.

The almost unaninious approval
of the recommendation came after
a lengthy debate over the ﬁnancial

. r,_

and administrative implications of e
such a center and ‘questions ‘about _

how steps toward establishing ‘the
center would be controlled by
senate council. I
Presenting a 28-page report that
outlined the investigative work the
special committee has done» since
its inception a year ago, Professor
Ronald Curran asked the council to
endorse the concept of the center
without considering ‘the budgetary
and administrative recommend-
ations ‘included in the report.
Those recommendations, said
Curran, ‘were theoretical and not
necessarily for implementation. He
asked no endorsement of them but
called only for council approval of
the special committee’s stand that
a campus information, and referral

. center be established.

Planning andresource manage-
ment systems director Jack’ Free-
man stated endorsement of the
recommendation would mean a-
study by the Ofﬁce of the Vice
Chancelor of Student Affairs to set
up a budgetiand stafﬁng pro-
cedures for the center.

That proposal, Freeman said,,
would then be directed to his ofﬁce
for review, and subsequently to
appropriate senate council .com-

 mittees and ‘Chancellor Posvar for I

further examination.

No further plans for the center
would be presented to the senate
council after endorsement ‘of the
special committee recommendation
unless requested by other senate
committees, Freeman added.

Professor Norman Mulgrave,
Senate Budget Policies Committee
Chairman, stated his committee
stood mid-ground on the request.
Mulgrave said members of that

.committee favored the idea of an
information center, but had reserv-
ations about the cost of
implementation and any expansion
of administration that might be
necessary.

“For the past two and three
years Senate has held there would
be no ‘net’ administrative, staff or
presumably faculty increases over
the next few years,” Mulgrave
stated. ’ ' ‘

The budget committee’s, ap-

. r

proval of the concept of the center -

had been sought by the special
committee prior to Wednesday’s’
meeting, as was the endorsement
of -the student ‘affairs committee.

r Handicapped on Campus

Greyhound buses have been
stripped of two-thirds of their seats
and equipped with hydraulic lifts to
provide an efficient transportation
system for handicapped students‘.
An extra five minutes was also

allotted between class periods to"

allow handicapped students‘ more
time to get from one’ place to
another.

Pitt, however, has inherent-
problems that-cannot. be helped,
Cardamone noted. The many hills
and climate of Pittsburgh are two
factors working against handicap-
ped people and cannot be changed.
The attitude of non-handicapped
students is one factor that can be
changed, however, according to
Cardamone.

“Many students’ don’t ‘know how
to react to someone in a
wheelchair,” said Cardamon.e.
“They feel they may have a bad
experience because they have had
no previous contact.” -

 With Boost from City Blacks

(Continued from page 1)
A‘Flaherty aide offered the same
reasons for Flaherty’s defeat. “I
don’t know that anything went
wrong other than what he (Flaherty)
said. He said people voted for a
change. That’s what they did. A
“The voters knew he was a
Democrat and had endorsed Gover-
nor Shapp on three occasions, and
maybe they held that against him,”
the aide said. '
. To win the election Thornburgh
stayed clo_se to Flaherty in the two
major metropolitan areas, Pitts-
burgh and Philadelphia, and won
overwhelming margins in the
traditionally Republican rural coun-
ties in the center of the state.
Flaherty defeated Thornburgh by‘
only 17,400 votes ‘in Allegheny
County and polled only 36,800 more
votes than Thornburgh in Philadel-

phia.

Thornburgh, a former federal
prosecutor who promised a purge in
Harrisburgh to end corruption
there, apparently managed to
attract the support of blacks and
Democrats to take the victory over
Flaherty.

The Republican gubernatorial
candidate ran strong in inner-city
city precincts where blacks were
wary of F laherty’s civil rights record
and amongDemocrats who distrust-
ed Flaherty’s deﬁant individualism
that constantly alienated party
leaders.

Thomburgh’s close victory ends
eight years of Democratic rule in the
state‘ house under Gov. Milton
Shapp, whose administration was
rocked with scandals.

“We have an enormous task in

this state.‘ Pennsylvania has the
stuff, the resources and the
stick-to-it-tiveness to build it back-to
the state it has to be,” Thornburgh
told supporters at the William Penn
Hotel.

After the victory announcement,
Senator H. John Heinz III told
reporters that Pennsylvania gov-
ernment would be open and willing
to work with any Pennsylvanians
with Thornburgh as governor..

‘The most important change is
that the government in Pennsyl-
vania is going to be a~thing of trust.
It’s going to be an open administra-
tion and it’s going to work with
people whether they are Republi-
cans or Democrats, young or old,
black or white. Thatwas the basis on
which Dick Thomburgh won,”
Heinz said. «

hiding. He then proceeded to rape
her, the victim said.

The crime was reported to the
Center for the Victims of Violent
Crimes and later to city and campus
authorities to whom the victim

released a description of a black’

male, approximately 6 feet fall,
medium build and unshaven with
unkempt, hair.

The following week the victim was
able to identify a photo of the
alleged suspect with help from City
Youth and Sex Squad detectives.

,_ Johnson’s preliminary hearing
originally was slated for Oct. 24 but
was postponed at the request of
Johnson’s attorney, Donald Camp-
bell. Campbell asked that his client

be granted the right to be identified
in a police lineup.

The hearing was rescheduled for
Oct. 31 but once again was canceled
on the same grounds because of a
delay in granting the lineup, which
ﬁnallytook place Monday, just prior_
to the hearing. Johnson was

‘identiﬁed a second time by the
victim from a group of men of
similar build and facial features.

Campbell contends the identiﬁ-
cation is insufﬁcient evidence to hold
and arraign his client. ‘

J ohnson, who, at the advice of his
attorney, did not plead his case at
the hearing, repeatedly interrupted
the testimony of the victim.

“Ma’am are you sure I’m the

man, ” Johnson said. “I swear I was
at the Campus Ministry studying
theology ‘and philosophy when all
thishappened.”

Johnson was called out of order by
Donaldson, but her warnings failed
to silence the suspect‘ during
testimony.

Campbell also asked for a
reduction of his client's bond,
initially set at $1,000. Assistant
District Attorney Thomas Corbett of
the‘Allegheny County District
Attorney's Sex Assault Division
objected to any change in the bond.
Donaldson agreed with Corbett and
denied the request.~

‘:‘I did not set this bond originally

so I won't change it,’7 Donaldson
said. .“In addition to this, I really
cannot ‘see any change in the

circumstances or evidence that

would warrant a bond reduction.”

"‘We have her -word and nothing

else,” Campbell said. “We have no ~

physical evidence -that this was

‘rape——not even a hospital report.” ‘

Johnson will be lodged at the

Allegheny County Jail on charges of

rape, criminal trespass and indecent
assault. If convicted, Johnson faces
a sentence of 10 to 20 years on--the
rape charge alone. His formal
arraignment has been slated for
Dec. 22. The case is expected to
come to trial some time in -February.

Iranian Leader ‘Accusedof FosteringCIass I   L

( By The Associated Press

PARIS - The man who may shape
the future of Iran, a country
ravaged by political violence and
cripling strikes, smiles gently as he
speaks of his followers cutting
Iranian policemen to pieces.

There is no visible sign of the ﬁre-

brand "fanatic in. the Ayatullah
Khomaini. The old man sitting
cross-legged on the. floor of his
suburban home rarely raises his
voice. Butthat gentle.voice, exiled

from Iran since 1963, has aroused .

revolt among Shiite Moslems, who
constitute morethan 90 percent of

e I Iran’s population.

The embattled govemmentr of
‘Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavihas
accused Khomaini of mastermind-
ing a campaign ._ to impose an
anti-‘Western regime on o'ne"of the

. "West's crucial ‘suppliers of _ oil.-

Khomaini rejects the accusation
that he is ‘anti-Westem.

Khomaini makes no secret of his
hatred for the shah and has said in
interviews that he wants to depose
him and form an “Islamic
republic.” lfwthe present effort
fails, he said, he.will call for all-out
civil war. '

He said ‘he would reject any
alliance with lran’s communists-

because they are “against God."j

But he never. has concealed his

"admiration for the late Primef

whose seizure of Iran’s‘ Western-
run oil industry in 1951 threw the
West into‘ its ﬁrst oil crisis.

The crisis in Iran was sparked by
orthodox Moslems demanding an
end’ to the shah’s westernizing
reforms, which they say are
contrary to the Koran, the Moslem
holy book. They were joined by the

estimated that more than’ 1,000

refused, to stop inciting‘ his

   Some Relief  
  I'OII1 Washington

Thank you President Carter. V _
The president last week signed into law a program

that will allow more middle class college students to

take advantage of basic grants from the federal
government. I

The middle income assistance‘ program will in-'.
crease the number of Pitt students eligible for Basic _

Education Opportunity Grants from approximately

4,000 students to anywhere between 7,000 and 8,000
students, according _to Frank Dutkovich, director of I

the Office of Student Aid here at Pitt. A
“Basically, whatrthis is going to. do is broaden
eligibility for the Basic Education Opportunity

'Grant,’’ said Dutkovich. “Before, eligibility for the

grants was based on a very strict need analysis.”
Previously, only students whose families earned
approximately $l3,000.to $14,000 a year were eligible
for the federal grants. Carter’s endorsement will
now allow’ students whose family income is no more
than $20,000 to receive federal money. Thisglimit
would be raised to $25,000 per family, according to
Dutkovich, over the next several years. Students

eligible for‘ the program may receive a maximum

, year’s gubernatorial candidates, so it seems likely ‘“

that Pitt will get no increase in the $63.1 million in
aid received from Harrisburg for 1978. The abolition
of state senatorial scholarships has caused a loss of

$700,000 in funds for Pitt, and though there is talk of ‘

turning the scholarships over to the Pennsylvania
Higher Education Assistance Agency, that will take
time and the money will probably remain lost for the
winter term. _ /

Posvar explained’ at a University Senate Council ’

meeting last September that if current trends con-
tinue, ,Pitt’s.undergraduate-population will decrease
by6,000 between 1979 and 1989. He added that the

administration’s goal is to restrict the decline to 800 ,,.,;

Washington has to be considered a pleasant surprise.
Although, the federal program ‘was endorsed by

The Fight Against the U.S. - In South Africa     

By ERIKA KREISMAN

The situation in Southern Africa
is excellent. The revolutionary
masses in Zimbabwe led by the
Patriotic Front control 85 percent of
Rhodesia and have the Smith
‘regime on the brink of collapse.
Smith's last-ditch effort to split the
Patriotic Front has failed miser-
ably. His army is disintegrating
and white settlers are fleeing in
droves. Though invited to the
United States by a band of 27
senators, Ian Smith came crawling

V. on his knees and was met with
I protest and a state department

denial of his pleas. Independence is
at hand.
The revolutionary developments

in Southern Africa have brought

, the struggle to a,critical point and

have focused on the isolation of tlfe
bastion of reaction, the South
African government itself. We are
witnessing a historic turning point
in the liberation struggle of the
peoples of Southern Africa.

The support movement in 3the
United States is stronger and more
widespread than ever. The World
Council of Churches has contri-
buted $85,000 to the Patriotic Front
and $125,000 to -another revolu-

tionary organization in the last

month. United Steel Workers Local
1011 stipulated in its contract with
Youngstown Sheet and Tube that it
will not work with coke imported

from South Africa and chrome from ‘

Rhodesia. The Krugerrand has '
been banned from coin shops
across the country. Even the
Pittsburgh City Council has passed
a resolution urging citizens to
condemn apartheid by not’ buying
or selling the gold coin. .

College campuses are ﬁlled with
activity,. Progressive students have
led demonstrations at more than 50
schools, including Princeton, Co-
lumbia, Harvard, California and
Cornell. A core of conscious
students has inaugurated a divesti-
ture campaign here at Pitt.

Africa, because those U.S.-owned

multinational corporations are the_'

retaining walls -of the white
minority regime. When the African
uprising and subsequent Sharpe-

ville Massacre shook the founda-
.tions‘of the white ruling class,

American monopoly capitalists
swooped down to save the day and
plant investments to the tune of
$1.7 billion. All that cheap labor
and mineral resources yield vast
profits, seemingly so well protected

,by fascist marital law.

The divestment motion has hit a

‘raw nerve in the white minority

clique. -In fright, they have directed
Myron Feldburd, dean of the
University of Capetown School of
‘Busine‘ss,.to send a questionnaire

‘to American colleges and universi-

ties ’ ‘to determine the nature and
extent of American student opposi-
tion‘ to — univeristy investment‘ in
corporations with connections to
South Africa.”

Yet while our demand of all U.S.

.. investments out of South Africa is‘
. important and vitaleto create. the V’
best conditions for the’ Azanian

people to liberate themselves, we
must raise the level of our
movement and /strike at the heart of

- the problem. For the arrow to hit

the bullseye we must aim directly
at the U.S. government. Without
diplomatic relations, with the
ambassadors and free trade that go
with state-to-state recognition, this
blatant support of the racist regime
would be illegal. Cutting diploma-

tic ties with South Africa would be A

a devastating blow to its rulers.
Right now South Africa virtually is
isolated throughout the world.
None of the Organization of African
Unity countries or socialist coun-
tries has diplomaticrelations with

/ , .

them, The vast majority of'
third-world countries has nothing ,

to do with the Smith regime.
The only friends South Africa has
are developed capitalist countries
of Western Europe, Israel, Iran
and its principle political prop, the
U.S. government. These con-
sistently are the only‘ countries in
the world to veto U.N. resolutions
for a total economic boycott and ‘oil
embargo against South Africa-. Our
government consistently breaks

diplomatic ties with countries ‘it ,
wants to isolate, including Cuba '

today. We say that we, ‘-the

American people, want to cut all ‘

ties with the criminal apartheid

system of South Africa. And our _

target is clear.

It is the state machine of U.S.
imperialism that concretely‘; ‘is
reinforcing apartheid. and is '-tlvie
root cause of _the abuse 
exploitation of workers -and op-
pressed nationalities, not‘ only in
Southern Africa but in America as
well. We can indict this corporation
or that corporation for atrocities in
Southern Africa. Only when fwe
recognize the -control the U.S.

corporate elite has over. our-

government and its domestic and

international policies will we

understand the true nature of
imperialism and the systematic and
pervasive class oppression and
racial discrimination it breeds.

U.S. imperialism did not die with
its defeat in Viet Nam. Once we see
the unsgrupulous ‘lust for power
and bounty that drives our ruling
class, we know we must organize
our protest and put them on guard
so the American people will not be
silent and duped. , ’

Victory in Southern ‘Africa is
certain. Our concrete support can
bring up the sun sooner.

Larry Flynt Associate Wounded   it

By The Associated Press

COLUMBUS, Ohio—A key exec-
utive of Larry Flynt’s pornography
enterprises was in ‘satisfactory
condition at a hospital yesterday
after becoming‘ the ‘third person
injured in violence against‘ assoc-
iates in Flynt businesses in eight
months. ‘ ,

Walter William “Bill” Abrams,
33, vice president of Leasure Time
Products, was shot Monday night
outside the ﬁrm’s headquarters.

Eight months before, Flyntlwas

‘ paralyzed below the hips by a shot

fired at him in Lawrenceville,_ Ga.,
where he was the defendant in an
obscenity trial. His attorney, Gene
Reeves Jr., also was injured in that
incident. _

In addition, ‘a bomb went off
Sept. 14 in acar at the Columbus
home of William B. Rider, regional
sales manager for Flynt Publica-
tions and ‘brother-in-law of Althea
Leasure Flynt, ‘Larry Flynt’s wife.
Nobody was hurt in that incident,
however. ‘_ .

No suspects have been arrested
in any ‘of the violence._

Abrams was in University

‘It

Hospitals after being shot in the
chest while gettinginto‘ his car.
Police said a high-powered‘ weapon
was used, but they didn’t’know the
motive. 

At_the time, Abrams was with
Flynt’s brother Jimmy, who is
president of Leasure Time, a sex
paraphernalia ﬁrm.

Jimmy Flynt said Abrams didn’t
want to talk to anybody Tuesday.
“I could tell you the CIA done it,”
Jimmy Flynt said, ”but all that’s
bull. If I can’t_give you the facts, I
won’t give you nothing.” ‘

‘ Flynt has claimed that either the
FBI or the CIA" was involved in his
shooting because of stories in his
publications dealing’ with the
assassinat_ion of President John F.

Kennedy .‘ ‘
Deputies said there is little
chance Abrams was shot by

mistake. He had just opened the
_ door of his car, which was parked in
an assigned space with his name on

Jimmy Flynt, in his own car,

heard a shot and ‘saw Abrams‘ fall.

After a few seconds, they said,

Abrams ran to ‘Flynt’s car and ‘the

  PHILADELPHIA—Colorful‘ and
‘ . controversial Mayor Frank L. Rizzo,
* who led a charmed political life up to:

now, was repudiated yesterday by
voters who refused to let him run for

 a third term.

By The Associated Press

Voters across the nation marked
ballots yesterday with their ‘ans-

.wers to ‘a jumble of knotty

questions and, on at least one

‘issue, they were saying ”no:”.

Early returns from Virginia, New
Jersey and Florida found voters
turning thumbs down on measures
to legalize gambling.

.statewide ceiling on health costs

Missourians were rejecting a

drinking ‘age from 18 to 21. .

mayor’s brother, Joseph Rizzo, is
the city’s ﬁre commissioner.

Albert V. Gaudiosi, a longtime
former Rizzo aide and former
campaign manager who broke with
the mayor overthe charter change
issue, said he wasn’t surprised by
the vote outcome.

Democratic candidate to succeed
Rizzo. “Ifeel sorry for him. Ithink

Until yesterday, Rizzo had
worked political miracles in Phila-

~ down when his current term ends in

Whether he can come back in
politics later on remains to be seen.
But many of his supporters

regretted Rizzo’s risky decision 9'

early this year to ﬁght for the
charter change.
They would have preferred
seeing him leave office as a winner.
Philadelphians also defeated, a
Rizzo effort to change another
charter provision, which requires

city officials to resign before they 473*

can run for other offices.
Riizo had often indicated that he
might one day run for governor.
Nicknamed “The Cisco Kid”
during his days with Philadelphia’s

He was re-elected that time, in
1975, even though he had ﬂunked a

.faced embarrassing questions

about the ﬁnancing of his home.
_ The charter change battle drew
intense interest in the city,

overshadowing the race for gov- _

ernor and other elections, and

resulted in a record number of newt?

voter registrations.

Amid the heavy voter turnout

yesterday, controversy continued to
swirl around Rizzo.

NEW YORK..—Voters said yester-

Democratic Gov. David Boren

Republican Sen. Dewey Bartlett.

Overall, the early returns raised
no prospect of a signiﬁcant shift in

party lineups, and that worked to -

the advantage of the Democrats,

The survey indicated that Demo-
cratic congressional candidates
would pull about 54 percent of the
nationwide vote, with Republicans

Twenty-seven percent of the
voters said their opinion of ' the

Democratic and 12 percent said they

The late actress Joan Crawford

She grew up an‘ abused child and
her past tormented her even as she
was one of MGM’s top stars during
Hollywood’s golden‘ years.

She married four times—the ﬁrst
three (to actors Douglas Fairbanks
Jr., Franchot Tone and Phillip
Terry) ended in divorce. Her last
marriage was with Pepsi Cola-exec
Alfred Steele. She won an Oscar in
the 1940s besides gathering several
nominations. When Steele died,

and later changed to_ Christina. She
ju_st had divorced Tone and set a
precedent for single-parent adop-
tion in California. Crawford, who
suffered several miscarriages dur-
lng her marriage to Fairbanks, was
unable to bear a child physically. ‘
Soon it became evident she could
not bear adopted children mentally.
Christina I was followed by
Christopher, originally named Phil-
lip Terry Jr., which was changed
after Crawford’s divorce. Five
years later, Crawford, single again,

_adopted two female infants, who,

though born of different parents
more than a month apart,‘ were
referred to as “the twins” by
Crawford—Cathy and Cindy.

For some reason, the younger
children were spared the brunt of
Crawford’s unpredictable temper
and almost fanatic discipline.
Christina and Christopher weren’t.

as another fatality in the age of rock
’n’ roll or the beginning of a
reconstruction of the mellow tone
John established in the late 1960s,.

There is no house-burning
sound, no jack-hammer rhythm, no
rock ’n’ roll. “A Single Man” is
overrun with redundant chord
progressions typical of the “Blue
Moves” album and a few cuts on

This lends it some of the John

shallow.‘ The changing of the

Jules and thePolarbears --

S I By JANMEDOFF

‘ ‘Jules and the Polar Bears’ ’ is not
an average name for a rock ’n’ roll_
band. Unfortunately, Jules and the

‘Q5-lar Bears may be just an average

rock ’n’ roll band.

‘ Their premiere album, “Got No
Breeding,” is an uneven album,
with songs ranging‘ from excellent to
shoddy. The former makes you want
to party; the latter makes you want to
ship the Polar Bears back to the
Arctic. .

Jules is lead singer Jules Shear,
who writes the songs and delivers
‘Them with a sound resembling Elvis
Costello. Unbelievably, Jules
manages an even more sickly voice
than Elvis. His voice, however, is
the finest part of the band.
Much of the album’s music is

cluttered, a result of the producers
trying to cram too many sounds into
every song.
half-spoken vocals and quirky lyrics
work best-when balanced by simple
guitar, harmony and acoustic piano
arrangements. A clearer production
hand could have done a lot here.

“You Just Don’t Wanna Know”
opens the album andpshows Jules
and guitarist Richard Bredice at
their best. Jules moans, and Bredice
screeches in a song about a girl hung
on her newfound status. The Polar

* Bears provide excellent harmony on

this and the next cut, “Black Fever
Sheep.”

On “Black Fever Sheep,’ over a
strong beat provided by drummer
David, Beebe, Shears wails lines
such as “their words were so sharp, I

was tempted just to sit and count the

have a witty touch.

“Lovers By Rote” is impressive,
with screaming vocals and with
Bredice grinding out an impressive
guitar solo.

wood from Disaster, ’ ’ the rest of the
record is pure drivel. '

Unfortunately, except for “Drift-
wood from Disaster,” the rest of the
record is pure drivel. Jules and the

In the hard-charging rock style

intensity. Mick Jagger is intense.
Tom Petty is intense. Jules Shear

. Writers Name Boston ’s Jim Rice Most Valuable Player    

By The Associated Press
NEW YORK—Slugger Jim Rice
of the Boston Red Sox, ‘” the first

American Leaguer in 41 years to-

accumulate more than 400 total
bases in a single season, was named
the AL’s Most Valuable Player for
1978 by the Baseball _Writers
Association of America yesterday. ,

Rice beat Cy Young Award winner

\ Ron Guidry of the New York Yankees
’-"icomfortably.

The Boston slugger
received 20 ﬁrst-place votes from the
28-man BBWAA committee and a
total of 352 points, while Guidry. a

"Larry Hisle,

unanimous choice for the AL Cy
Young Award last week, had 291
points in the MVP election and the
other eight ﬁrst-place votes.

The only player to break the’
Rice-Guidry hold on the ﬁrst two
voting positions was Milwaukee’s
who received one
second-place ballot and ﬁnished
third with 201 points.

Rice won the MVP designation

followingan awesome season at the ,.

plate. He led the majors with 46
home runs and 139 runs batted in,

and had 406 total bases—-the first

AL hitter to reach that plateau since
Joe DiMaggio had 418 total bases in
1937. ’
Rice also led the majors in hits
with 213 and in triples with 15. He
had a slugging percentage of .600
and batted .315, third in the
American League behind 1977 MVP

‘Rod Carew of Minnesota, who hit

.333, and Al Oliver of Texas, who
had a .324 average.

It took that kind of statistical‘

dominance __to beat Guidry, who led
the majors with a 25-3 record that
included nine shutouts and a 1.74
earned run average. Guidry’s .893

winning percentage was the highest
for any 20-game winner in baseball
history.
Rice and Guidry were the only
players named on all 28 ballots.
Following Hisle were Amos Otis of

Kansas City, who had 90 points;

Rusty Staub of Detroit, 88'; Graig

Nettles of New York, 86; Don Baylor‘
of California, bl; Eddie Murray of
Baltimore,50; Carlton Fisk of

Boston, 49, and Darrell Porter of

Kansas City, 48.
. Carew ﬁnished 11th with 46
points. ‘
Rice was only the sixth player in

the history of the Arrierican League

to break the 400 total’ base barrier. in

Guidry’s chances for the MVP", 8
probably were damaged by the" 
existence of the Cy Young Award. _

Since 1955, when the baseball

writers ' added the."Cy‘,.Young‘ to" =

  Mark   Night Ends Fulfilling lCareer Against West Virginia

By ANNA ARLOTTA
Pitt News Staff Writer
Tonight’s soccer game with West

 Virginia won’t just be the last game

“ ‘of the season for Pitt’s Mark Nigh; it

will be the last time Nigh will playin
a Pitt uniform.

When Nigh first arrived at Pitt, -

the Panthers just had begun a
transition in which Nigh would play
an important role. That transition
centered around building a success-
ful soccer program.

Coming off a European tour with
the Shimano junior soccer team,
Nigh had been exposed to
international competition prior to

ﬁhis freshman year at Pitt. Soccer,

including the method of play and
fan support, proved different than

what Nigh had become accustomed _

to. -

“Soccer is alot differennt  at

Pitt than it was back in the Lehigh

Valley,” said Nigh. “Fan support is ‘

deﬁnitely a large factor at games,

and the Pittsburgh area just hasn't.

acquired that support for soccer yet.

“Also, the game was a lot
different when I-ﬁrst came here,”
added Nigh. Pitt’s method of soccer
was just kick and run. Now we have
developed as a unit and play a much
more complex level of soccer.”

Since his freshman year, Nigh
has been ‘a starter for Pitt.

“Mark broke into our lineup early
in his freshman year and has earned
his starting role from the very
beginning,” said Coach Leo Bemis.
“He is one of three seniors (along
with Erv Seigel and Craig Connolly)
this season who have started all four
years_i,a_t.Pitt.” _ , ,

Over" the» years, Nigh has ‘been

positioned; on? the ‘front  line-, the...

midﬁeld and now,vin his ﬁnal year,
atfullback.

This season, especially, has been
one in which Nigh constantly has
shown his versatility. Not only has
he played defense at the fullback
spot, Nigh has? contributed to the
Panthers’ offense.

“This_. season Mark has played
steadily,” said Bemis. “He is one.
‘of the regulars you build a team
around. Not only has he proven
himselfon defense, but he also has
come up an applied offensive
pressure. He has played well all
season, but he had exceptional
games in our wins over Penn State
and Indiana. Mark also scored
three goals and has four assists,
which is good for a defensive
player.” A .

"professional soccer career, current-

Two tickets to the Pitt-West
Virginia game and_an autographed
picture of Cas Myslinski and Leland
Byrd to whomever can answer the
following questions: ‘‘

Which of Saturday's teams is
considered young by its coach?

Which team's performance has
disappointediits coach so far this
season? ' i '8

Which team has been able to use
the big play to an advantage in
‘1978? A

Which of the two teams still will
be playing football when New

Year’s Day rolls around?

If you answered “both” to the
ﬁrst two questions and ‘ ‘neither’ ’ to
the last two, don’t make any plans

_ for Saturday afternoon and start

looking into a nice 8-by-10 frame.
“I still think this is the most talent

I’ve ever had here, ’ ’ said Mountain- ,

eer coach Frank Cignetti. “We
haven’t played as well as we
thought we could.”

‘ ‘Everybody’s - disappointed,”
said Jackie Sherrill. “Hell, I am
too. I’d like to win every game.”

Cignetti found little to be pleased .
about except the best home .

attendance ever at West Virginia
and the 19 redshirts returning next
year. Sherrill, becoming stingier

‘ with praise for his team, found

something. he liked in Saturday’s
18-17 win over Syracuse. "

 “Winning the game the way we

did was betterfor us than going out
there and beating them, 34-O, ” said
Sherrill. “We had some opportuni- _

,  ties _to ‘quit, .. l.,J_ut;_l-we came back. ’ ’
 ' Sherrill indicated he willcontinue

his youth program and will be trying

to work the younger players into the .

lineup more and more (especially on
offense). Freshman Russell Carter

and Barry Compton will be joined in M

the backfield at some time this

will be known as the Pennsylvania
Stoners and will be coached by
Willie Erlich. '1
“Professional soccer has been
something I have had on my mind
for a long time now,” said Nigh.
“Now it is so close to becoming a
reality. I've played this sport about
10 years and put a lot of time into it
and have received a great deal of
things in return. I have had a lot of
good coaching and have been able

to compete against and play. with a Z_

number of very skilled and
knowledgeable athletes in those
years. Being able to turn
professional will be a reward for all
those long hard practices and
games. '
In Nigh’s last game of the season
he, along with the rest of the

.'Pant_hers, must face a rebuilt

Mountaineer team. According to
Bemis, the Mountaineers are a

*.

coming Saturday by Bryan Thomas.
“We haven’t been able to keep
those backs healthy enough ‘to get
them in the games and get them
some experience,” A
coordinator Don Boyce. “We have
to get people to learn some things
before they're ready to play in the
game.” >

Sherrill also indicated Lindsay ‘
Delaney will see some actionsat "

quarterback.

The Panthers went to a two tight
end formation against the Orange-
men and used Gordon Jones as _a
play messenger. Although
unhappy having the best college
receiver on the sidelines for halfthe
offensive plays, Sherrill made the

move in the best interest of the

team. ,

“We did it to lock Syracuse into
an even defensive front,”, said
Sherrill. “Once we ‘forced them/to

standardize, we knew where they'd ’

be and our people knew who t

According to Pitt water polo coach
Jay Fisette, a bad attitude prevented
his team from winning a third

championship. But it wasn't Mike
Schoﬁeld’s fault. f '

V Fisette said Schoﬁeld made “many

personal sacriﬁces” in moving from
the ﬁeld.

“No one wants to play goalie,”
explained Fisette, who last season

played at Bucknell. ‘ ‘It’s like hockey

in that respect. Most players want to
be out in the ﬁeld where they can
shoot and be involved in the more
physical aspects of the game.-

“Mike, probably one of V our best

shooters, was looking forward_ *to_
playingin the ﬁeld this season. We. '
felt bad we had to move him, but he" ‘

adjusted well and handled the
responsibility.” ' 
Although he didn’t enjoy being a
goalie, Schoﬁeld said the position
change didn’t bother him as much as
the attitude of many of his

teammates.

‘ ‘We had some attitude problems
that led to some A of "our other
problems,” said Schoﬁeld, who
singlehandedly almost"led Pitt to

‘ lateseason wins over Fordham and _
Army.» “A lot of, the guys didn’t -

want to get up early. in the morning

want to participate in sports, you're
expected to make some sacrifices. '

captains. “But then I realized they”
were still my teammates, even
though they had some problems with
their attitudes.”

A’ water polo team consists of
seven players—six ﬁelders and one
goalie. All of them have similar
responsibilities, except the goalie.

“The guys in the ﬁeld can shoot, ”
Schoﬁeld explained. “The only
thing the goalie can do is stop the
‘-other team’s shots.

“__‘The' goalie is really the
quarterback of the team, ’ ’ Schofieisjj-
added. “It’s his responsibility to
position the defense and get the
attack going, when necessary. He
also talksto the other players and
lets them know what’s going on.

Cignetti certainly must share that
option.

PITT NOTES: Rick Trocano has
gone over the 1,000 yard mark for
passing yards in a season. That is ’
the 10th best seasonal performance
by a Pitt quarterback and the second
best mark by a sophomore...In
three home games the Panthers
have averaged more than 49,000 a
game. By averaging a little betteﬁ/§_
than 47,000 in its ﬁnal two home
games, Pitt will break the seasonal
attendance record of 47,978 set last
year.

Pantherette Spikers christened in Hoosier Classic

By JEFF DUROSKO
Pitt News Staff Writer

Pitt made a name for itself as well
as. for Eastern volleyball last
weekend, when the Pantherettes
placed second at the Hoosier Classic
in Bloomington, Ind. Coach Mike
Hebert’s team competed against
seven strong Midwestern squads
and won three of ﬁve matches.

Hoop Scrimmage

The Pitt basketball team will
hold its Blue-Gold scrimmage
Saturday, Nov. 11, after the
Pitt-West Virginia football
game. The tune-up_will be held
in Trees Hall and is free to
anyone interested in a bit of

, basketball after an afternoon of
football.

   

Pitt, now with a 31-9 record,
opened Friday night against
Cleveland State, a team that
defeated the Pantherettes earlier
this year,-15-13, 15-4. Pitt avenged

that loss by winning two straight

15-11 games.

“It was nice. to get that one
back,” Hebert said. “We played
horribly against Cleveland State the
ﬁrst time.”

Pool play continued with the
Pantherettes facing Indiana and
winning, 15-4, 11-15, 15-10.
Eastern Illinois was Pitt’s next foe,
and it proved too tough for the
Pantherettes, who lost, 16-14,
15-11.

With pool play completed, Pitt

~ found itself tied for ﬁrst place in its

pool with Cleveland State and
Indiana. Since the Pantherettes

defeated both teams, Pitt entered

semiﬁnal play as the top team in its
pooL

In the semifinals, Pitt faced
DePaul, the tournament favorite.
Pitt won a close first game, 15-13,
but DePaul rebounded to take the

' second game, 15-9., In the rubber

game, Pitt dropped‘DePaul, 15-7, to
move on to the finals against
Purdue. .

- “Purdue is one of the strongest
teams we’ve faced all year,’.’ said
Hebert. “I was even more
impressed with them than. 10th-
ranked Houston.” ’

In a best three-out-of-ﬁve match,
the Boilermakers needed only three
games to send Pitt home as-
runnerup once again. Purdue won,
15-1, 15-11, 15-5. '

“Purdue simply blew us out,”
said Hebert. “They beat us
decisively, and we never really even
challanged them.”

Hebert commended Ingrid
Mueller for a_strong tournament,
“especially her attacking in the
middle of the offense, which was
very effective.” He also cited
Nancy Zentner, who started every-

‘tournament match for the ﬁrst time.

Pitt now. is anticipating Friday’s
Eastern Regional Championship
foes Maryland and Penn State,
which travel to Tree’s Hall. Pitt will
be seeded second in the regionals
behind Maryland, while Penn State
will be seventh.“ ‘ V

“The top two teams in the East
will be playing here Friday,” said
Hebert. “It should be a fun,
exciting match for us and for the
spectators. Maryland always plays
well against us.” I \ '

The Terrapins alsohave develop-
ed into a great Pitt rival during the
tearn’s three encounters this
season. Pitt won the ﬁrst meeting at

and last week at its own tournament.

Hebert once said Pitt has the

Pitt’s Walt Brown Refuses is

To Feel

By KARENKADILAK
Pitt News Staff Writer ’

Snapping the ball" on Pitt’s
game-winning field goal Saturday,
center Walt Brown said he didn’t
feel any pressure.

.‘ ‘As far as I was concerned, it was
just a regular snap,” said Brown.
“I try not to put pressure on myself
by thinking something is a potential
game-winning situation. That tends
to make matters worse.”

Pitt defeated Syracuse 18-17, with
Mark Schubert’s 28-yard ﬁeld goal
clinching the winin the ﬁnal three
minutes. . 1

Although Brown said he didn’t
feel any pressure, the senior
conceded‘-a bad_snap could have
“thrown the whole year off” and
probably eliminated the Panthers
from the bowl picture.

“Nine times-out of 10 I put the
ball back there without any

problem, ’ "Brown said. “Saturday, I -

snapped it, Scott (Jenner) did a good

job holding‘, and Mark kicked it. we

' didn’t have any problems.”,
Schubert said he. feels confident
with Brown. at center. A

“It’s nicetoknow he’s there, ’ ’ the
“His ~ whole ,
attitude puts you at ease. He’s very ‘

placekicker said.

confident.” V" ‘ ‘
_ Considered bythe coaches as one
of the best long snappers in the

nation, Brown is in his ﬁrst year as a _

full-time starter, having spent the
past several years almost exclusive-
ly on the special teams.

“It’s been great. starting,” the
ﬁfth-year senior said. “‘I’ve been

working here four or five years for '_

this honor. ” I consider myself a
veteran because of this, although I
have only been starting this season.

‘ ‘I hope to come on strong in these

~ last two or three games,” Brown

,._

continued. -“I hope to improve a lot

Pressure

in several areas, one of which is
leadership. I feel I have certain
leadership qualities, but I really
haven’t used them.

“I have to improve on my
assignments too,” Brown'added.
“My pass protection\and reach
blocking, where I block the man
between me and the «guard with a
hook block, could be better.”

Brown is “amazed” with the
amount of publicity he’s received
over the‘ past two years.-

“I’d never thought I’d get so
much,” said Brown. “You don’t
think of a guy who’s made, his
reputation as a long snapper getting
this much attention.” 1

Married last Valentine’s Day,
Brown has received much support

‘from his wife Margie, and step-son -

Ricky, who loves football.
“They"ve come to all our home

games,” Brown said.‘ “They didn-’t

get to see last week’s game, since it

-wasn’t on television, but they did see ,

your game at Notre Dame. Knowing
' my wife and son are watching spurs
me on.”

The Pitt junior varsity football I , 3

‘team ﬂashed a ray of hope into‘ the
gray areas of the varsity team when’
it defeated Youngstown State, 34-3,
Monday at Pitt Stadium.

Some of the varsity’s problems
include the inability to make the
big ‘play and the lack of a big
running back. These were less of a
problem for the junior varsity team.

’ The more promising upcoming
players include three freshman
running_ backs. Russell Carter,"

- by coach Kevin Dickey.“ _

_.“Carter is a big, strong ‘running
back; size is his big plus. He also
shows‘ signs of speed,” said
Dickey. Carter let the cat out of the
bag when he outran the "Youngs-
town defense ’ on Pitt’s ﬁrst play
from scrimmage and went 77 yards
for a touchdown.

“Compton is alittlé smaller, but
he’s »a tough runner’. ' Thomas
weighs in at 188 and'he’s still
quick,” added Dickey. “All three
backs had a good game. they are

still young and have to work,

themselves into‘ the varsity line-
up.” > .

Both Carter‘and ‘Compton played

last week against‘ Syracuse, and

Thomas has rushed for 39 yards on
two carries so far this season.

Junior Scott Jenner‘ was not‘
about to,‘ be shown ‘up by his
freshman backﬁeld mates. Jenner
threw a pair of touchdown passes to
Keith Williams for 16 and 34 yards,
respectively, and pitched to
Thomas who scored on a‘ 32 yard
run on an option. -

“Jenner had a good game both
passing ‘and ‘running. He read the
option very well and was able to

consistently, find his receivers,”
said Dickey.

Williams, considered one of the
premier receivers in New York last
year, made two ﬁne catches. On his

12-yard touchdown, he beat the."

‘corner’ badly to the ball, and
34-yard touchdown catch was made
reaching back with one .hand,
tipping the ball forward and
catching ‘it on the way down. As a
senior last year, Williams exhibited
an ability to return kicks when he
scored on an 89-yard kickoff return

andant 85-yard punt ‘return. ‘His’

ability may assist the ailing ‘varsity

Environmentalism—will it muddy the job pool?
Some people think America will have to spend a trillion
dollars by the mid-1980s on more pollution control. Could
this hurt your chance of getting a job you want? We hope
not—but it’s a possibility. '

America simply doesn’t have a trillion dollars to spare.
Shifting so vast an amount from other uses will disrupt
nearly every other national goal.

Adding costly environmental equipment doesn’t increase

industrial production. So once the equipment is in place,

the handful of new jobs created for pollution control is more
than offset by production jobs that don‘t appear. Spending
large sums on unnecessary extra pollution control means

companies can’t spend that money on some-
thing else——like new jobs. -

. We’re going to need another 17,000,000
jobs in this country by 1985. These days the

average jobs costs $45,300 to create. So a trillion dollars is

more than the total cu'rrent cost of creating 17,000,000 jobs.
Even if we had a trillion dollars, America couldn’t
satisfy its most extreme environmental demands
already on the books.’ Air quality rules now lock
important areas of the country out of any new indus— ‘ A
trial development. And water quality standards
being applied to all bodies of water, no
matter how they‘re_ used, will stymie even
population growth in many parts of the U.S.
We all want clean air and water. We've
‘been sensitized to pollution’s dangers for
years. But the fact is: America's air and
water have been getting cleaner lately. We‘ve
obviously still got a lot to do. But as we_do
it. we need to study carefully the costs and
benefits, to keep environmentalism from
tying America up in knots.

Plain talk about POLLUTION CONTROL. »

So far, Armco has spent $260,000,000 for pollution control
systems. Running that equipment costs us another
$50,000,000 or more a year. We’ve slashed our air emissions
95% and are a leader in water improvement. But now we’ve
passed the point of diminishing returns. Cutting into -that
final 5% costs more ——and wastes more electrical energy+
than it took to stop the entire 95%. What’s worse, gen-
erating the electricity to operate equipment to reduce
emissions further often creates more pollution atpower
plants than we remove. As a nation, we need to balance en-
vironmentalist demands against their consequences. ’

Next time somebody ‘says American industry ought to
._ u start cleaning up its act, you might like to
