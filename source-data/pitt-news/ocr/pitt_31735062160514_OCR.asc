HARRISBURG AP —— The

House adjourned yesterday for a

two-week election recess, post-

I - Pitt. Police Switch 1

 Emergency No.

- The new University of Pittsburgh
Campus Police emergency number
is 2121. , '

Joseph Gil, director of Health,
Safety and Parking said ;the old
emergency numbers 4045 arid‘4046

. ‘£5-._would be retained in case’ anyone

forgets the new number. _
“2121 is our new primary
emergency number. The telephone

on number 2121 is linked to the _

4045 and 4046 telephones. So, if

you dial the 2121 and it’s already, I‘

busy, your. call will be transferred

to 4045 and 4046.” . '
Gil said 2121, which went_ into

effect this month was the number

;- the department, asked for when

Centrex was installed. “We found
2121 had already been assigned to
another department, but‘ we put up
a fight and now we have the
number we originally wanted.”

‘— There were three reasons the

i‘<'3'Canipus Police Force wanted the

2121 number,iGil said.
1) It's easy to memorize _
2) It takes a minimum amount of
time to dial (2.5 seconds as

compared with 6.8 seconds for the V

4045 number--seconds that could
stop a fire, or save a life.) '
3) Campus telephones can be

~ locked to prevent outside calls but

the emergency number can still be
reached. L '

Gil said. “If a guy wants to lock
his telephone on the number 8--so
that 9 and 0 can’t be dialed; thus
preventing off-campus calls--if he

 locks it on 8. he save his phone bill

 

i and stills allows for security calls."
Gil said the Police Department is

‘. going to take measures to publicize

this new emergency number. 1

instead of every three months.
While the "GOP has gone along

with the monthly payments clause,

it has refused to back any hikes

beyond 5 percent. "

‘ “We have today proposed to our
Democrat colleagues
Senate and -House that they join us

in ending this controversy by‘

agreeing-to the 5 per cent increase
already voted by the House,"-the
three Republican members of the
House-Senate conference commit-
tee said in a joint statement.

“We were refused. As a result, '

we can only ‘conclude that the
Shapp administration and its
leaders in the General «Assembly
are playing politics at-the expense
of higher education." _
. -Rep/. James Gallagher, D-Bucks’,
one of three Democrats on the
conference committee, replied that
with the relatively‘ ,_ small amount

think they are playing games.”-
Democrats have offered to come

down to 5‘/2 per cent, leaving the

two sides only $900,000 apart,
Gallagher said, but the Republi-

Free Press infringements were

charged when a group of mostly .-

Greensburg residents marched on
the Tribune-Review offices‘ re-
cently. ‘ . _
Heading. the march were Arnold
Tarr, Pitt campus policeman and
Rev. ‘Donald Mcllvane of Oakland.
The group was protesting the
Tribune-R_eyiew’s refusal to -print
anything about the walk-out of 13
staff members, following the
dismissal of reporter Jude Dippold.
According to the Westmoreland
County Mt. Pleasant
Dippold was fired fora violation of
confidence after interviewing
County Commissioner Robert
Shirey. ‘ _ y A _
Dippold denies this is why he
was ﬁred. He claims he was
dismissed because his political
views clashed with the opinions of
thepaper. '4 ' s ‘
He said “The morning following

Agn_ew’s resignation, I‘ said ‘One I
“ down and-one to go,’ while in the

newsroom. ‘Immediately following

this remark I was summonedinto -

Alan G. Nicholasis office, the
-assistant publisher.

“Nicholas said ‘I understand
your political views are different

than ours so, I suggest that you

resign.’ I asked him’ if that meant
that I was out of a job and he said
‘Yes-.”’ " _ "

Bernice Berkey, of the School of

Pond said “The vice-chancellor
position needs a person who is

patient, broad-gauged, and a real"

leader in” every sense. The
individual must have the capacity
to manage a complex set of
circumstances and have personal
strength to move the Health Center
to a higher plane.

“The University Health Center is
a large complex and a well-based
enterprise with a yearly budget of a
$150 million. It is an institution
providing health services, a train-
ing center, and the advancement of
knowledge through research.”

The vice-chancellor committee,
comprised of 14 elected and
appointed ‘faculty representatives,
students from the health profes-
sions and appointees of the
University Health Center, have
gathered 100 names of candidates
within and outside the University.

These names and possibly others
will be submitted to Chancellor

Adachi cliscusises election

A Socialist Outlines Party Goals

BY MARY BETH KENNEDY

“I think it's pretty clear, this time

at least, that we are not going to
win the election.” Despite this
pessimism, City Council candidate
Christina Adachi feels the Socialist
Worker's Party (SWP) campaign
involvement is worthwhile.

“There is so much anti-commun-
ism. People have a strong
reaction against socialism," A-
dachi said. “What socialism really
means is both a political and
economic democracy.” «

There are 22 Socialist Worker’s
Party branches in the United
States._The newest one organized
here last summer.

A former Democrat, Adaci be-
came disillusioned with the party.

that broke the camel’s back. I

Socialist Alliance (YSA) and the_

SWP.

These organizations, unlike
others. Adachi_said actively sup-
ported strong movements by
oppressed groups. “Being an
Asian woman, racism and sexism
interest me- Right now, of the
three Socialist candidates I am the
only woman and the only non-

white.”

Citing the educational systems
which steer woman into typing and
home economics classes and bar
them from industrial skills, Adachi
said, “We believe women’s second
class status is not a result of
biological inferiority but of cultural
conditioning."

“Women’s demands cannot ‘be’

added. “Free quality child care

demands is the replacement of this

capitalist system with a socialist ‘

society.”

As well as supporting the
women’s movement, the SWP
opposes racist oppression. “We

feel it is our responsibility to
unconditionally support the black"
liberation movement,”-’ Adachi
said.

She strongly agrees with the

Party's demands that better
housing, schools, and hospitals be
built in black communities. The
necessary funds would come from
taxing corporations, not indi-
viduals, she said.

“Though socialism. has an ul-
timate goal, that of economic and
political democracy, we believe in
fighting for our demands today.”

A noted publisher in Chicago re-
ports there is a simple technique
for acquiring a powerful memory
which can pay you real dividends
in both business and social ad-
vancement and works like magic
to give you added poise, neces-
sary self-confidence and greater
popularity. ‘

According to this publisher,
many people do not realize how

simply by remembering accu-
rately everything they see, hear,
or read. Whether in business, at
social functions, or even in casual
conversations with new acquaint-
ances, there are ways in which
you can dominate each situation
by your ability to remember. '
To acquaint the readers of
this paper with the easy-to-I
follow rules for developing skill
in remembering anything you
choose to remember, the pub-
lishers have printed full details
of their self-training method in

and his followers marched to the
Tribune-Review and were met by
assisiant publisher Nicholas.

According to Tarr, Nicholas
offered no explanation for the staff
members’ resignations.

When contacted last Wednes-
day, Nicholas still offered no
explanation of the issue. He said
“The issue is dead and anything I
have to say is already printed in the
Tribune-Review editorial.”

In the editorial Nicholas wrote
-that ‘fln the past two weeks we

have revised our format to permit
broader news coverage. We are
now expanding our news gathering
capabilities far beyond anything in

Tarr feels the newspaper is
obligated to cover all news,

many important new issues are —

ignored by the news media. _

_ The statement by Bill Waddel of

 have ‘ever read. It would be

ignoring it would suggest that it
I has some validity. ’
 _ What Mr. Waddel calls for is‘ the
 destruction of the state of Israel.
 Whatever one may think of Israel
' fas a state, it was founded by the

 establishment would be call intoT
-- »‘challenge the existence of dozens

5 ._which' the nation’s life is at
 Mstake--is ignored. Mr. Waddel
calls the killing of guerrilla hoods
‘who bomb, kill, kidnap, hi-jack,
‘“. ' blow up supermarkets and schools,
‘ ,and‘ltill Olympic athletes “outra-
‘ geous actions.” I wish I had his
‘moral sensitivity. . .
4, . Likewise, Mr. Waddel sees the.
  1967 war as expansionist. The
 U capture of the Golan Heights had
' --_‘nothing to do with the regular
' shelling by the Syrians. of Israeli
. , ‘ . villages. And the invasion of the »
 Sinai had nothing to do with’ the -
»  threats. of Nasser_ to throw" the
Israelis into the sea, to emasculate
 the men and rape the women. But
for the ﬁrst time in history, we see
_ a new principle in operation: the
nation that is threatened with
destruction and ﬁghts to defend
' itself and wins must act like the
loser. Tlt must surrender to the
if loser without a peace treaty, with
no‘ guarantees, with nothing. Let
me suggest to Mr. Waddel that
Israel should be treated like other
nations: it should give up what it
won on the exact same day that the
great, freedom loving Union of
' Soviet Socialist Republics gives up
vLatvia Estonia, and Lithuania,
* which it won in World War II; that

   

 

 r -'it give up Manchurian territories

the Chinese claimj and that China

A ‘ give up Tibetan, Nepalese and
~ ‘ “Indian territories that it has taken.
This refusal to treat Israel like
other nations, to establish one rule
of law for others and a completely

_ different one for the Israelis, is
. nowhere seen more clearly than in
, Professor Cottam’s statement on
the middle east. Unlike Mr.
Waddel, Professor Cottam pre-

‘ sents an intelligent, balanced, and
intellectually honest statement
about the Arab viewpoint. There is
an Arab point of view that has to be
discussed,'and dealt with honestly.
Despite the tragic overtones, the
egg has been scrambled, and it

‘ _ does not get unscrambled. Israel is

must be worked out. It will not be
worked out as long as the Arab
states confuse propaganda with
reality, and as long as they believe
that their real problem istlsrael.

Their real problems are hunger and
illiteracy, political oppression and
ignorance. Unfortunately, if Israel
were to disappear tomorrow, by
tomorrow night there would be

wars between the ‘various groups.

within the Arab states, between the
-Arab states, between the Arab

' people and their leaders". Israel is

the only significant’ stabilizing
_factor' in the middle east." _

But while Professor Cottam’s
it too
refuses to treat“ Israel like a plain
ordinary nation. A return to
pre-'67 borders again refuses to
consider history: then the Israelis
attackedto prevent an attack;mnow
they didn’t attack to prevent an
attack. In both» cases they are
wrong. As Mr. Waddel so ably put

it: the Israelis are responsible for '

this war--despite the attack by the
Egyptians and Syrians--because
they were there. More signiﬁcant-
ly, Professor Cottam calls, in all
"honesty and ‘sincerity, ‘for.-a
Palestinian state. Ifmd it an
embarrassment to remind _a politi-
cal scientist that when Israel was
established in 1948, a Palestinian
state was also established, on the

west bank of the Jordan. That state »

was taken over beforeit could get
going by King Hussein. In the
twenty-five years since the estab-
of Israel and the
destruction before its establish-

_ment of the Palestinian state, I.

have never heard a word against
Hussein's aggression. , I have
heard Israel attacked for‘ its

treatment of the Palestinians; I '

have heard demogigical idealogues
like Mr. Waddel attack the Israelis

for defending themselves against .

the attacks by the Palestinians; I
have heard politicians and diplo-
mats call for Israel to redress
grievances; but I have never heard
anybody criticize the Jordanians for
their aggression. ‘Now the Israelis
have the west bank,_of the Jordan,
taken as a result of the 1967 war.

And the Golan Heights. And_ the

Sinai. And they will have chunks of.' 1

Syria and Egypt. And the

nonsense will go on.

  Incorrect
Information

Dear Editor: ~

Bill Waddel's article. “Guilt for . .

War Rest with Israel" in the
Friday. October 19 issue of the Pitt.
News is an excellent example of
ultra-emotional propaganda based
on incorrect information. Either
Mr. Waddel does not know history
or he is deliberately giving
erroneous information to his
readers. He emotionally tells us
that Israel “ruthlessly carved a
niche for itself...'by stealing Arab
lands...“What he forgets to men-
tion is that the land was sold by the
Arabs and paid for in cash as well
as blood. The Arabs sold what was
thought to be worthless land but
now that the land is productive they
want _it back. -

Again. Mr. Waddel sets forth, an
almost eloquent plea for the poor
Arabs, forgetting to mention that
the Israeliswanted and asked them
to stay and participate fully in

Israeli life. ‘They werenot forced to
leave Israel and it was only after
repeated ‘attacks on Israeli settle-
menths by the Arabs that laws were
inforced to protect all the citizenry.

I deeply deplore the position in
which the Arabsfind themselves
and wish that their legal status
could be improved. However, that
can only happen when the Arabs
both in and out of Israel cease their

obvious but futile attempts at ~
genocide. . .
Mr.‘ Waddel's use of the

exhausted accusation of “military
aggress'ion"' only shows the ab-
surdity of his arguments. Only
someone totally deafened byrhis
own propaganda could interpret
the”Arab atack on Israel on Yom
Kippur as “Israeli military aggres-

sion." ‘Mr. Waddel tosses around -

references to racism and imperial-
ism in an‘attempt to blind the
reader but his ultra-emotionalism
ignores historieal I and‘ present
facts. Fortunately, his audience is
one composed of college students,
faculty, and staff who can
recognize ‘propaganda and not
mistake it as fact. . i '

.To Ms. Sexton,

Editor, Pitt News

After a’ very close‘ callﬂthis
afternoon, I would like to submit
this story for publication in the Pitt
News. I hope it makes my_ point.

Presby's emergency room swar- '

-Letters  to the Ed ito 

med with hysterical students and
hysterical motorists. The students
w.ere. carrying torn books, torn
clothes, torn limbs, and were
screaming obscenities at anyone
holding a driver's license. The
motorists were. carrying crushed‘
bumpers, shattered headlights and
battered windshields; they were
screaming obscenities at anyone
holding a Pitt- l.D.card.

“What the hell is goin on?"
screamed the interns. ‘

Somehow. a few discerning
interns were able to piece together
a story. It seemsthat it all came to
a head on Thursday afternoon

around I o'clock, in front of the _-

Cathedral i of Learning. The
students, "tired of being late to class
or late to lunch because of the
traffic. decided" to pretend the
traffic didn't exist and they
stormed. en masse. across the
street to Schenley Hall.. At the
same time. the motorists, tired of

' being late to work or late to their

lunches. decided to pretend the
students didn't exist and stormed
80 miles per hour down the street.
in their cars, taking all the
disbelieving students with them.
Result: disaster.  I ,
Well. you can see why all these.
people were pissed off. and rightly

so. How would you like to wait for -

half an hour just to get across the
street? How would you like to
crawl along at 2 miles per hour
having a heart attack because -these
kids just keep pouring in front of
your car (or bike)? There's just no
safe way out. _i ' ’

Theiinterns. hearing both sides of
the story, decided to form a
committee (don't you love commit-

Have acokei

‘Safety Patrol (cheaper, since it was

tees?) to try to come up with some
equitable eolution to this mess.
They were tired of having to patch
up crushed and bleeding bodies all

the time. so they. suggested to the -

University that it either hire a few
cross__ing guards (with while gloves,
of course) or appoint a fw of the
more intelligent ‘students to a
Safety Patrol. ' i

The University opted for the

the interns are happy because their
work load has decreased; the
motorists are happy because they
make it to lunch on time and the
students are happy because they
get to wear those neat white belts.

claims, “At a party, you can’t tell
who's got the ginger ale.”

As an example of misleading

classiﬁcations Zigmond cites the

barbiturate. People think of
barbiturates as only ‘slowing a

person down’ and making a person‘

ineffective. Zigmond explains, ‘‘If
one is drowsy, barbiturates will
put the person to sleep, but if one is

hyper-excited, they wouldimprove '
, his performance."

A myth that Zigmond explores

centers around "the popularizedl

“Speed Kills” slogan. ' “It’s
uncommon for anyone to die from
the effects of speed.” Zigmond
explains that because the lethal
dose increases with tolerance it
takes more and more of the drug to
cause death. “Speed is dangerous

for a secondary reason. It
depresses. sleep and appetite,
which leads ,to' illness.” This

indirect danger ‘is also, common
among alcoholics who become ill,
not due to alcohol, but due to the
malnutrition that goes along with
it. ' V -

“We “were not designed to have
things injected into our blood-
stream. The stomach is designed
to ﬁlter out the impurities and pass

amphetamine illegal is that it is
difficult to obtain legally manu-
factured speed. More and more is
being made by amateur druggists.
The impurities are the things that
get you. Thishas always been
true of LSD. Almost all of the LSD
has always been manufactured
illegally. LSD doesn't cause
genetic damage, contaminants
do." .
Zigmond says of street drugs,
“You don’t know what you’re
getting. You don't know the
purity. content, dose, etc.” A
perfect example of this is heroin.
The lethal dose of heroin doesn't
change. But the dose needed to
produce a high does. This is due to
rapid tolerance. “You get closer
and closer to lethal dosage. If you
suddenly get a batch that is more
pure than usual, death is likely.”
Marijuana is probably the most
controversial item in the drug
debate. Which is strange, as it is
probably the least dangerous, or,
so Dr. Zigmond would say. Claims
the pharmacologist, “We know
more about. marijuana than all of
the prescription drugs.” He adds
that the way marijuana is com-
monly used it is not dangerous.
Street pot, which usually contains
about 1% active ingredents, taken
a few times a week, is not a real
Zigmond further states
that caffein, found in coffee and
coca-cola, is potentially more

  American-Speed

dangerous than marijuana. While
there is no evidence of physically
addicted pot smokers, the coffee
fiend is a common personality in
our society. “There are strange
reasons why things are legal and
illegal. Aspirin would be on
prescription if it came up today.”

What is the criterion for legal
vs. illegal? “As things get
popular, they are usually made
illegal." says Dr. Robert Conna-
macher, professor at Pitt Medical
School. He explains that metha-
qualude, or soapers. will soon be
an illustration of his point. There
has been a boom in soapers intake
on the college campuses, as well as
on the high school level.
Connamacher feels that govern-
ment restriction is just around the
corner.

this article, I ran into Captain
Midnight. She was standing in the

“Captain,” I said, “You’ve

I described to her the details of
the introduction to my article. She
didn't like it.

“But is that the real ‘me’_?” she
asked. '

“Well, can you see?”

-“I can see figuratively."

“But can you see literally?”

“Literally, I can’t see. I don't

at CMU Gallery A

BY ALAN CONANT

Until the Sarah,M. Scaife gallery"
opens or for that matter, the
University of Pi_ttsburgh’s student
gallery, the only place handling
student art to any great extent is
that of Carnegie Mellon. Located
at 5200 Forbes Ave., it is about a 15
minute walk from the Cathedral of

Learning.
C.M.U.’s student gallery is:
currently running a three-man

show which includes John Tiger-
man, Greg Weaver, and David
Macarelli. J. Tigerman’s massive

stuffed muslin sculpture is quite’
im'posing; appearing both grotes-7

que and beautiful at the same time.
Grotesque in that they are ungainly
and seem out of scale. However,
one of these “stufﬁngs”, “My
Grandmother’s Legs,” is beautiful
and succeeds well. It is simply two
long muslin sleeves stuffed and
then folded over each other, much
the ways an old woman’s arthritic
legs would look. All four of
Tigerman’s works are worth seeing
simply for their large size and
interesting shapes. ' 0

Greg Weaver, 0 working in oil
pastel and acrylics, puts depth into
a large canvas. “C.G.”, one of his

larger paintings is an exciting color"

exercise in acrylics. Weaver has
painted contrasting color wedges

that move in and out of the surface, '~

while blue-black slices .maintain
their own level and stabilize the
painting. Several smaller works of
his in oil pastel were included in
the show but they seemed
inappropiate beside his larger,
more vivid paintings.

The more subtle paintings were
those done by David Macarelli. His
large (8’ X 5') acrylic paintings
stood out especially for the fine
blending of hues. My favorite, in
the main room of the gallery, is a
brilliant blending of golds and
browns into an upright bar of red.

It is a delicate and well balanced‘

painting.

These paintings and the sculp-
ture. will be ,shown for another
week. A ‘-

Breakfast of Champions
QrI':Goodbye Blue Monday!
By'_Kurt Vonnegut, Jr.

With Drawings by the Author
 pp. New York: Delacorte
Press/Seymour, Lawrence $7.95

1- Kurt Vonnegut’s latest novel,
_ _eakfast of Champions, is sure to
please. his many admirers. '
Vonnegut will surely be remem-
bered by many readers for his six
previous novels including
Slaughterhouse-Five (1968)and the
excellent Cat’s Cradle (I960).
*'_Br_eakfast of Champions. like
o_ther_ Vonnegut books. is distin-
guished by the author's‘ unique
mixture» of fantasy, humor and
njdivcations of underlying serious-'

ness.

Vonnegut’s usual flaws appear
here also. The books, although to a
lesser extent than Mother Night
(1961) or God Bless You. Mr.
Rosewater (1965), are marred by
sentimentality and cloying cute-
ness. An example of the latter is
the frequent, almost incessant use
of the word “doodley-squat”.
Vonnegut also seems to think he is
being cute and clever when

. he draws an asshole and in another

instance a pair of underpants. I’m
not impressed.

"While we're on the subject of
Von_negut’_s drawing-let me ‘note
that they are childish and add
virtually nothing to the_ novel,
although occasionally they do

complement a description of a lamb
or an electric chair.

Breakfast also marks the re-
appearance of familiar Vonnegut
characters such as author Kilgore
Trout and wealthy Eliot Rosewater.

The central character of the work
is Pontiac Dealer Dwayne Hoover
who lives in Midland City. Prolific
but generally unrecognized author

Kilgore Trout. (several of whose,

works are described in marvelous
synopses) is invited to the Midland
City Arts Festival at the urging of
Eliot Rosewater. Hoover goes mad
turning against his friends.
Hoover’s madness is attributed
to “bad chemicals” as well as bad
ideas. When he reads Trout’s
novel “Now it Can be Told” which

Vonnegut makes many sharp
comments in his descriptions of
Kilgore Trout’—s visit to New York
City, Holiday Inns, and artists.
The author also attacks the realistic
novel which he criticizes for
“accumulation of nit-picking de-
tails". ‘

The style of Breakfast is unusual
and differs even from other
Vonnegut works. Vonnegut writes
in short paragraphs, some a mere
one line in length. His prose is
simple and functional.

Vonnegut’s most unusual stylis-
tic device is his frequent intrusion’

as the author of the book, into the

novel. He constantly reminds the
reader that the novel's events are
occuring as they are because he
made the characters. .

aspects of society which turn
people into robots. Vonnegut’s eye
for the absurd notes many
ridiculous things in society such as
a trucking company named after
pyramids which are stationary.

The author’s reasoning strikes
me as being somewhat simplistic
and superficial. You can't attribute
everything to bad chemicals.

In spite of its flaws, Breakfast is
superior to the three‘ other
Vonnegut novels that I have read
for its general seriousness of
purpose, sharpness of observation

* (although Vonnegut attacks rather

easy targets) and refined style. .

Breakfast, a mixture of_ despair
and optimism, humor and tragedy
should, please readers who like
Cat's Cradle, and the other books.

SPORTS EDITOR

The highlight of the Pitt football
luncheon yesterday was present in
voice only. Ben Schwartzwalder,
the Syracuse coach for the past
quarter-century, had the media
people roaring with laughter again
and again.

“lf Johnny Majors is listening,
(he was), tell him not to be a pig,".
said Schwartzwalder. “He's so far
ahead of schedule that people are
going to expect him to go all the
way next year."

The Syracuse coach, who will be
retiring at~the end of this season.
would like nothing more than to
secure his first victory of the season
Saturday when his Orangemen visit
Pitt Stadium.

Schwartzwalder has had only two
losing seasons in 25 years in
Syracuse, and one of them came
last year. Asked if he thought he
should have retired prior to ‘the
start of this season, he said, “Well,

at least this way nobody will be
sorry to see me go, and -I won’t
mind going.” .

The Orangemen had perhaps
their best performance of the
season last week. losing to a highly
touted Miami Hurricaine squad
34-23. “If we hadn't thrown so
many interceptions and fumbled so
much." said “Ben“, “we would
have won."

Asked if his team was beginning
to show some consistency. he
replied, “Consistency -is a word
that we don't know much about.
We sputter."

When asked

if he had any

trouble getting his 0-7 team up for"

its games, he paused for a while,
then sidestepped the question.
“On a broader basis, I’ll just say
that we have trouble winning
football games.”

The subject of the Pitt offense
came up. “You can start
anywhere, but eventually, you get
around to Tony Dorsett. If he
catches a heavy cold this weekend,
it would even things up a bit."
Dorsett has played with more
adversity than a cold, so “Ben”
may indeed be in trouble.

Hopes For Even Season Fade

BY BART MACK
ASSOCIATE SPORTS EDITOR
For 45 minutes, the Pitt Soccer

team played the best ball they had
all season long. But from the start
of the second half, the Slippery
Rock Rockets took the spotlight to
come behind and beat Pitt, 2-1,
yesterday afternoon on a rain-
drenched Pitt Stadium turf. The
loss sets Pitt's record at 4-6-1 and
the booters will now have to
struggle desperately to wind up
with a .500 season.

The usually quiet Pitt offense
came out like gangbusters to start
the contest and John Curley missed
on a pair of chances seconds apart
from close in on the Slippery Rock
goal. Rocket netminder Steve
Nevling came up with a ﬁne save
on Curley's initial shot and
received help from one ' of his
fullbacks to stop Curley on his own
rebound.

Pitt kept the pressure on, with
opportunity knocking every" time
they brought the ball * into the
Slippery Rock zone. Al Jutca just
missed putting the ball in the net as
his headshot following a Pitt
cornerkick sailed just inches over
the crossbar. Joe Luxbacher, who
had four shots on goal in the first
half, was robbed by Nevling as he
took a pass from Curley and ﬁred a
shot that glanced off a Rocket
fullback, forcing Nevling to make a
diving stop.

Slippery Rock came right back
and showed some of the poise they
brought into the game along with
their 9-1-1 record. Pitt goalie Bill
Haines was forced to make eight
stops in the first half, some coming
on action. close in after Rocket
cornerkicks.

Luxbacher ﬁnally received some
results for his efforts midway
through the first half with an assist
from John Chrisanthon-. Luxbacher
took Chrisanthon’s pass from
across the ﬁeld and broke in alone
on the extreme left wing.
Luxbacher’s shot glanced off
Nevling but caught the upper right
hand corner of the net to put Pitt
out in front, 1-O.

With that shot, Luxbacher tied the
Pitt record for career number of
goals, 31, set back in 1960-63 by
Bob Cuthbert. Luxbacher has
three games remaining to estabish
a new record. ‘

He had two beautiful opportuni-
ties only minutes after scoring, but
hit the right goalpost on one shot,
and ﬁred wide right on a direct
kick.

The game was also extremely
physical affair and tensions ran
high on both benches. Throghout
the game there were numerous
tripping fouls called on both sides
along with pushing and obstruction
calls. The hit of the day came when
Pitt fullback Denny Kohlmeyer
flattened his opponent right in
front of the Slippery Rock bench.
The Rockets took their toll, though,
and Denny Kohlmeyer's brother
Bob, paid the price. Kohlmeyer
was taken from the ﬁeld late in the
second half after colliding with an
opponent.

Slippery Rock tied the game at
1-1 in the first two minutes of the
second half. Jon Stroj fed a picture
perfect 'pass to Mike DiChov in
front of the Pitt nets and DiChov
headed the ball past a helpless
Haines.

The Rockets kept the pressure on,
as they carried the play to Pitt

during the opening portion of the
45 minutes. On a corner kick
immediately following the ﬁrst
Slippery Rock goal; Haines missed
on an attempt to bat the ball out of
danger but Pitt fullback Tim
Tremont was there to back up his
goaltender and head the ball to
safety. '

The winning goal was rather‘

anti-climatic but - nonetheless a
credit to heads up play on the part
of the Rocket's Kamal Houria.

Haines was dribbling the ball out
before picking it up to punt but the
slippery conditions let the ball get

JOE LUXBACHER, number 22, fired in his 31st career goal to tie the

away from him. Seeing that the
Pitt goalie had lost possession.
Houria raced in andﬁred the ball
over a sprawling Haines. _

The Rockets then processed to
play a defensive game, concen-
trating on keeping the ball out of
their half of the field. Pitt had but a
few good chances and those were
easily stopped by the Slippery Rock
defense.

Pitt's next opportunity to get back
on the winning track will come this
Saturday, when they entertain
Gannon College at Pitt Stadium
following the football game.

Pitt record but did it in vain as the booters dropped their sixth game of
the season. 2-1, to Slippery Rock yesterday at Pitt Stadium.

again, I'll know‘it's fixed,",,

declared Long. Kirby did not play 1 -

against Navy. _
Asked about the unpredictability

of his kickoffs, Long replied,

“We’re sneaky at Pitt. We like to;

Vmake the other team wonder where _ V-

we are going to kick it.”

Long’s kickoffs were not up to
par in the Navy game. “I guess I
was too excited about the ﬁeld
goals," he said, referring to his
record-tying three three-pointers.
“It seems that when I correct one

, thing, (the placekicking), theother

goes bad. (the kickoffs.)
“We have many sayings here at
Pitt," said Long, who probably

' created half of them. “My favorite

one is, ‘lt’s a short walk fromthe
palace to the outhouse."'
Haffner’s last two proteges are
both playing in the NFL. ‘Dean
Carlson, number three quarterback .
for the Kansas City Chiefs, played

at Iowa State several years ago, '

and George Amundsen, the Cy--_
clone signal-caller last season, was
the number one pick of the Detroit

2 Lions. .

“Amundson was one of the
finest option quarterbacks in the
country last year.” said Haffner.

“He had been converted from a V
running back, and really loved to

:carry the football."

The ﬁnalwplay of the Navy game
was Billy Daniels dropping back
and losing 13 yards to kill the clock.

“Amundson would never have =

done that," said Haffner.

“We were about to beat_
Missouri for the ﬁrst time in 15
years, and we told Amundson to
run out the clock,"
Majors. “Instead of falling on the
ball. he’d be waving it around
trying to gain yards. I was on the
ground begging him to fall on the
ball. ‘It'll ruin my rushing
average, coach,‘ he told me."

“He has a good sense of
humor," said Majors. “Sometimes
more than I can take."

Majors gave two reasons why the
Navy game was so close. “First,
we weren‘t.as sharp as we had
been, and second, Navy had
something to do about it."

“I was very impressed with Navy

and their coach. George Welsh."
he added. They're an up and
coming football team.”

Majors’ number one assistant,
Jackie Sherrill. was married-
Sinday. “He was up to grade
films, but was 45 minutes late,”
said Majors. “We gave him
Sunday night off. I don't know
what he did." .

BY G. W. STEVENS

The Western Pennsylvania Inter-
scholastic Hockey Association is
presently. in its third year of
existance. When the. league was
first formed it consisted of eight
teams but, unfortunately, it turned
out to be a one-team league with
Pitt going undefeated and no one
else even coming close. The league
tightened up somewhat last year
with Carnegie-Mellon. and Indiana
putting together good seasons in
pursuit to the powerful Panthers.

Nevertheless; the Pit’; skaters
were able to cop the [champion
honors for the second year in a row.
As a result, when they take to the
ice next Tuesday night to ‘open

.their season against Penn State--
Mckeesport. the Panthers will be 1

going for their third_straight league

championship.’ They should be in

for a much tougher season however
since several of their opponents
will be fielding much improved

inexperienced skaters.

The strength of this year’s Pitt
team could depend on the play of
its goaltenders. Just who will start
in goal next week has not yet been
determined. Pitt has been blessed
with three excellent goaltenders,
and anyone of the three could lead
the team to the championship.
Mark Lieberman, last year’s starter
and Bart Mack will both be back
this year. Both have looked
extremely promising in practice
thus far, Mack has shown a great
deal of improvement and just could
come on to win the/starting nod.

The third candidate for_ the goal
position is junior John DeFazio, a
transfer from Pitt’s Johnstown

_campus. He has looked promising

in practice and just might be able to
work his way up to thevstarting job.
Last year Pitt’s goalies posted a
1.78 goals against average.

Much of the Panther’s success
last year was due to the
outstanding play of the defence-
men. The defensive crew of
Glenn Hyde, Kerry Browne, Duke
Shaeffer. and John Finney did
everything but sell tickets, taking
much of the pressure off of the Pitt
nets. But Hydeand Browne will
not be‘ on the ice Tuesday which
should weaken the defense con-
siderably. However, Hyde will join
the team when the football s.eason
is over, and Browne will return to
action in January. ‘

There are three skaters who could
step in to ﬁll the temporary holes in
the Pitt defense. Bob -Arturo and
Russell Stump, both freshmen,

could crack the lineup; Hopefully I

they will be able to stay away from
the costly mistakes that plague
Carl “The
Enforcer" Grady is the other
possible starter,’-showing consid-

erable_improvement from last year.
-The Panther offense should be
powerful again the year. The club
was hurt by the loss of Phil Clarke,

Billy Glanville, and Dave Bahnson, ’

but there shouldn’t be any problem
ﬁlling the vacancies. Freshman
sensation Rick Vernon will center
the first line with Charlie Hagins,
another transfer from Johnstown,
and Denny Brownelon the wings.

The second line will consist of Joe

Testa at center, and\ Gary Cum-

mings and Greg Mintz on the
wings. All three are returning from
last years squad. The third line is
still in doubt but Jim Richter
should have one of the wings
positions wrapped up.

Pitt will also have a new coach this
season in Lenny Barklo as well as a
new home rink. Pitt's home games
will be played at the Civic Arena as
one-half of a league doubleheader.
Tickets will be $1.00 for students
and $2.00 for adults and can be
obtained from any team member,
at the Student Union ticket office or
at the Arena box office. Season
tickets will be available at $7.50
each.
