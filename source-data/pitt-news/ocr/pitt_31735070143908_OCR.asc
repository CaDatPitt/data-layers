The second presidential debate

between Sen. Barack Obama and

Sen. John McCain took place last
night at 9. Although the debate
was a different format and pro-
vided many opportunities for both

{candidates to lay down some good

points, in many ways it was simply
a more heated redux of the first
debate. Both candidates held their
own ground but delivered little in
the way of major blows or major
screwups.

Tom Brokaw of NBC moder-
ated the debate, and he deserves
credit as the most vociferous and
active moderator of this year’s
debates. Brokaw certainly wasn’t
afraid to interrupt the candidates
and lay down the rules when nec-
essary. But even Brokaw could
only get the candidates to follow
the rules up to a point. Obama
especially seemed prone to break-
ing the time lirnit and giving long-
winded speeches, though both
candidates went far over their one-
minute discussion period more
than once.

Despite all this, though, the de-
bate will probably have little effect
on the overall race. Along with the
lack of major knockouts or embar-
rassing gaffes, the candidates sim-
ply failed to move beyond many
of the talking points they delivered
in their debate on Sept. 26. Both
Obama and McCain were quick to

: reuse their own soundbytes against
ithe other candidate, and neither

really broached new territory.
Most of the answers were pre-
dictable, and the few that weren’t
were still far from surprising. For
the most part the candidates both
sounded like they were giving pre-
pared and rehearsed responses.
In a few cases they actually en-
gaged each other, most notably
on the topic of Pakistan, in which

Obama actually ﬂoured’ debate

change the game

rules and asked for a follow-up re-

sponse. For the most part, though, ,
they delivered the same answers to 

many of the same questions that
they got in the first debate.

This isn’t to say that the ques— 
tions were all the same, but that 
both candidates made heavy use 
of the tactic of sidestepping the 
question for one that they want 
to answer. Obama touted energy 
reform in questions that had noth- 
ing to do with energy, and McCain 
more than once focused on his 
Congressional record when asked 
speciﬁcally about how he would 

behave in the future.

There were no real game- i

changers in this debate, and ei-
ther candidate could —— and likely
will — claim victory. But McCain
missed out on his chance to bring
momentum back into his camp.

People who were undecided
before this debate are probably
still undecided, and for those who
were leaning one way or another,
there was enough from both can-
didates to attract people either
way. It’s unlikely that either can-
didate will experience a boost in
the polls, unless some unforeseen
controversy arises in the next few
days.

Even though McCain laid
down some good points in the de-
bate, and even though the format
favored him —— he’s a known fan
of the town-hall style -— McCain
is trailing in most polls, and this
debate probably won’t change that
fact.

Neither candidate really won or
lost, both gave strong performanc-
es that had a few weak points, and
overall it’s doubtful that anyone’s
mind is going to change because
of it. Hopefully, the candidates
offer better performances in the
third debate than they did in the
first two.

STAND missing the full issue

by Giles Howard

Colunzmi/t

   
 
 

I know that the Students Taking
Action Now in Darfur, or STAND,
means well. I know that the stu-

dents who painted the tent on the
William Pitt Union lawn over the
last two days believe that their ac-
tions will have a positive effect on
the situation in Darfur.

But naivete and baseless opti-
mism ate poor foundations for a
movement to stop acts of geno-
cide. The fact is, the turkey I drew
for Thanksgiving by tracing my
hand as a 5-year-old didn’t save lives
in Bosnia, and the STAND tent will
not affect the conflict in Sudan.

When I talked to Sarah Grill, a
STAND officer and an organizer
of the event, she said that the main
point of the tent is to raise aware-
ness about the conflict in Darfur.
Awareness is a marvelous thing, but
Americans were aware of what was
going on in Rwanda in 1994, too.

They watched it unfold on their
television screens, and yet they did
nothing to stop the genocide that
in the course of some four months
resulted in the deaths of 800,000
people.

We are all aware of the situation
in Darfur. We know that people
are dying daily, that they are driven
from their homes and are brutal-
ized by their government. Our lead-
ers and the leaders of every global
power know what is happening and
have chosen not to act.

 

Rather than acknowl-
edge the atrocities
committed in Iraq
in the name of the
United States with

their own tax dollars

college students tend
to focus on the crimes
of some third-rate
dictator thousands of
miles away.

 

But college students need to
feel important, need to show their
peers that they care about Africans
and need to express their constant
dismay that people don’t care about
what’s going on in an African coun-
try. As Grill said to me, “I don’t
understand why people don’t care
about [Darfur].” .

But my response is this: I don’t

understand why people don’t care
more about the actions of their
own government.

Since the start of the Gulf War
in‘ 1990, between 1.5 and 3 million
Iraqi civilians, depending on which
estimates you accept, have died as
a result of US. policy. Where’s the
outrage on campus?

Yes, we’ve seen anti-war pro-
tests, but the message from student
anti-war groups tends to be “bring
the troops home,” not “stop killing
innocent people in the name of my
country.”

That’s really my issue with stu-
dents who have decided to champi-
on the cause of Darfur. Rather than
acknowledge the atrocities commit-
ted in Iraq in the name of the Unit-
ed States with their own tax dollars,
college students tend to focus on
the crimes of some third-rate dicta-
tor thousands of miles away.

Omar al-Bashir doesn’t care
what Pitt students think about his
actions. He’s not accountable to the
American people. Instead, it’s the
American politicians who maintain
the Cuban embargo and allocate
money to the manufacture of mur-
derous cluster munitions who are
accountable to us.

It’s simply easier to oppose the

Appreciating artwork isn't just an act

by Erik Hinton

Colum/ziat

If you had looked to the skies last
week, you might have seen a fancy
beacon projected from Down-
town Pittsburgh summoning all
the culturally interested citizens,
wide—eyed students and other
folks easily lured by the promise
of free alcohol. This is not refer-
ring to a secret rave in the bowels
of Pittsburgh, and the whole bea-
con-in—the-sky image is entirely
metaphorical. I am referring to
the monthly gallery crawl of the
‘Burgh’s Cultural District, which
took place last Friday from 5:30
p.m. to 9 p.m.

I have been to these Dionysian
affairs in the past and have gener-
ally left with a profound sense of
disquiet. Now you may think that
this is leading into a rant on rele-
vant art that slams the offerings of
Pittsburgh’s creative community as
self-satisﬁed and contrived. How-
ever, I am a ﬁrm believer that even
the most outlandish and puffed—up

 

offerings —— thinkjulianne Moore
in “The Big Lebowski” -—— are in-
credibly important and that popu-
list art is every bit as exclusive and
inﬂated as haute culture.

What unsettles me most about
gallery crawls, museums, exhibi-
tions and dentists’ offices is the
attitude of patrons toward your
response to art. There seems to be
a contract that each patron signs
that binds him to spend as much
time inspecting other patrons as
the art itself. Overly loud sighs,
raised eyebrows, a touch on a
friend’s arm and a snicker: These
markers indicate that you are look-
ing at art wrong.

How can someone look at art
wrong? Well, apparently it’s very
simple. If not every piece strikes
you into existential paralysis with
Stendhal Syndrome, then you are
doing something wrong. To wit,
going to an art exhibition feels a
lot like when you were in grade
school and you couldn’t cross
your eyes hard enough to see the
hidden picture in the pattern. Ev-
eryone else is blown away as if the

silhouette of a dolphin is tapping
some fantastic truth, while you
just wander away in confusion.

It would be fantastic if this con-
frontation with art patrons were
just a minor annoyance. However,
it sadly marks a much more seri-
ous cultural malady. When being
a spectator becomes a spectator
sport, outward displays are con-
fused with real engagement. This
encourages not only fake perfor-
mances of artistic involvement
— the breathless “rnmm” of the
turtlenecked ranks, the single tear
of the art activist —— but also de-
feats productive communication
about art. An ethic in which art
viewers must respond physically
and emotionally to art denies dis-
tance, which is often necessary for
art to be productive. We generally
cannot separate ourselves enough
from the things that hit us hardest
to discuss them fruitfully.

Now, before my inbox is ﬂood-
ed with e—mails, let me agree with
you that there is plenty of discus-
sion in a gallery or at a crawl. How
can I possibly argue that modern

art culture hurts dialogue? I urge
you to listen more closely. The
vocabulary at these events, more
often than not, will be made up
of words like “powerful,” “raw”
or “human.” This way of talking
about art, more speciﬁcally, is talk-
ing about how art makes one feel.
Contrary to popular belief,
there is nothing particularly cultur-
ally important about how a piece
of art makes you feel. The liber-
alism that convinces people that
their personal reactions are pro-
found is a dangerous philosophy
that stops productive dialogue in
its ‘tracks. I’m not arguing against
introspection. I’m arguing against
being content with subjectivity. It’s
very nice that everyone has unique
emotions and reactions. However,
if we don’t address the world in
objective terms, we can’t have
those nice things we all like, such
as society or communication. Fur-
thermore, we can’t move forward
or innovate if it’s all caught up in
individuals’ unique feelings.
Imagine if we went around
talking about the world exclusively

in terms of our feelings: “Judge, is
the defendant guilty?” “Well, the
case makes me feel happy. No, he
isn’t.” Or, “Senator, should the bill
be passed?” “That law makes me
feel sad. I don’t like it.”

This is, of course, absurd. We
have to go beyond feelings and al-
low objectivity so society can ex-
ist at all. We need to assume that
some things can be objective, or
else we cannot operate with oth-
ers. Objectivity is sort of like a less
creepy Facebook: It keeps people
from being isolated.

Next time you go to an art
event, remember this lesson. It’s
more important how you act on
the art than how it acts on you.
Go past your feelings and talk
about how the art works in cul-
ture. If you feel like just breezing
through a gallery, then you are
neither wrong nor bad at analyz-
ing culture. You have just learned
not to milk art into some stimu-
lant. Also, our gallery crawl itself
is top—notch. Check it out.

actions of a foreign government
that has killed hundreds of thou-
sands of its own people than it is to
oppose the actions of the govern-
ment of the United States, which
has killed millions of Iraqis in the
last two decades.

When I was interviewing Grill
by the STAND tent on the Union
lawn, I noticed a STAND sticker
that listed historical genocides that
preceded Darfur. This is the list: Ar-

V menia, the Holocaust, Cambodia,

Bosnia, Rwanda and South Sudan.

Where’s the mention of the
genocide of Amencan Indians that
continued into the 1970s, when our
government forcibly sterilized thou-
sands of American Indian women?
Of East Timor, when hundreds of
thousands of East Tirnorese were
killed in a campaign of genocide
perpetrated with American arms by
the Indonesian military? Or the Iraq
Sanctions Regime, during which
500,000 children under the age of 5
lost their lives because Bill Clinton
wanted to make Iraqis pay for the

ly genocide

actions of their dictator?

I want to see the conﬂict in Su-
dan come to an end as much as the
members of STAND do. But I also
recognize that the US. government
has killed more civilians and created
more refugees in the last decade
than the government of Sudan.

Only one of those two govern-
ments acts in my name. In only one
of those two governments do I
have a voice.

MAD MEX BIG BENEFIT 3
Sunday
5 pm.

All Mad Mex Locations

As of this Sunday, Oakland’s Mad Mex
has been operating on Atwood Street for
15 years. That’s 15 years of food, friends
and really, really big margaritas. And
instead of drinking and partying the night
away, the restaurant is giving back to the
community in a delicious way for its an-
niversary through big Benefit 3.

On Sunday, Mad Mex and big Burrito
Restaurant Group, Mad Mex’s umbrella
organization, will donate all proceeds from
dinners to the Greater Pittsburgh Com-
munity Food Bank. Pittsburgh’s Mad Mex
restaurants are not the only ones contrib-
uting, though — the benefit will take place
in Philadelphia, State College and Colum-
bus locations, as well.

Picking up a burrito like this on Sunday will not only take away your hunger, but also do the sa.me for needy families around Pitts-

Passing on hybrid? Campbell sticks with his Buick

by Donald Campbell
Staﬁ’ W/riter A

 

Over the summer, I had two simple truths
in my life. i

The first was that I had a full-time job, and
the second was that I drove a large car. Un-
fortunately, the two truths were linked in the
most expensive way possible I had to drive
my large, albeit extraordinarily comfortable,
car — complete with a six-cylinder engine
rated at 29 miles per gallon highway — to my
job. My job happened to be out in Canons-
burg.

For those unfamiliar with the drive, it is
very pleasant. Rush hour, however, involves a
multitude of people with the united goal of
getting back into Pittsburgh, as well as a dis-
tinct lack of space. Route 376 gets backed up.
Sitting in traffic and looking down at my gas
gauge constantly dismayed me, as it slowly fell
towards “E.”

How efﬁcient it would be, I thought, if I
drove an electric car. Standing still, the motors
would be consuming negligible power, if any
at all.

Unfortunately, the electric cars currently
out on the market have neither the comfort
nor the power of my mid-sized Buick. If one

does, I would venture to say it would cost sig-
nificantly more than my Buick ——a used 2001
cost about $5500, and the original owner paid
about $19,000 for a new one.

Electric cars definitely do not have the
range. For many electric cars, my 20—mile
each—way drive over the summer would have
pushed boundaries, and that’s considering a
trip without any creature comforts.

So what was I to do? Obviously, I bought
the gasoline. If I had a significantly larger sum
of money, I could have considered a hybrid.
Hybrids run off of a rather ingenious prin-
ciple. The Toyota Prius, for example, has “par-
allel drive,” meaning that it runs at low speeds
off of its electric motors, and it onlykicks in
its gasoline engine when its batteries require
charging or when extra power to the wheels is
required.

This is all well and good, but gasoline is still
involved ir1 a signiﬁcant way. The Prius gets
much better gas mileage than my Buick Cen-
tury, to be sure, but only about 16 miles per
gallon more. The Prius is rated at 45 miles per
gallon highway. As with all cars, this rating is
dependent upon  habits,  condi-
tions and the load of peripherals — such as air
conditioning and headlights -— that you’re at-
tempting to run off of the system. American
hybrid designs, including the Ford Escape, are

similar.

The major problem many people see with
hybrids is the fact that if a hybrid owner ends
his trip with the batteries at 50 percent, his car
will engage its gasoline engine sooner on the
next trip to recharge. Why can’t you just charge
the batteries at home off of the cheaper, and
arguably greener, house electricity?

Theoretically, if this could be done, short
trips requiring modest acceleration and rela-
tively low speeds would never engage the
gasoline engine until the batteries were dead.
With a sufficiently large battery bank, the elec-
tric motors could propel the car 50 or 60 miles
without the input of gasoline.

Great idea, right?

This is what both General Motors and Toy-
ota are currently thinking. Toyota is developing
a new generation Prius, and General Motors is
developing the Chevrolet Volt. Unfortunately,
they are not set to come out for quite some
time. People want this new “plug-in hybrid”
technology now, and they are  to pay a
good amount of money to get it —— all in the
name of staying green, of course.

It is for this reason that \WIRED recently
published  article about plug-in hybrid con-
versions. Although people have been attempt-

ing the conversions themselves for a rather .

significant amount of time, business has, until

recently, turned a somewhat blind eye. Now,
however, entrepreneurs and specialized shops
are beginning to realize that people are 
to spend thousands upon thousands of dol-
lars to convert their existing hybrid vehicles to
plug-in hybrid status.

A full conversion could cost, as WIRED
reports, $30,000. A kit that can be installed
at home or by an authorized mechanic could
cost $5,000 — and that’s for the cheap, low
performance batteries.

All of this is well and good, but there is a
problem. Fundamentally, everyone consider-
ing such a conversion needs to weigh his rea-
sons for doing so. Saving on gas seems to be an
invalid justiﬁcation for shelling out the money
to buy a hybrid and then convert it. A Toyota
Prius stock costs $22,000  A conver-
sion of $30,000 would push its cost to $52,000.

Even with 100 miles per gallon, it would

seem impressively difficult to ever recoup the
price premium in the lifetime of the vehicle.

If you want a cheap alternative to save on
gas, buy a little econobox.

If you wish to be green and nothing more,
then maybe plug-in ‘hybrid conversion is a
route to consider. \

A A gasoline engine can’t, after all, be any less
damaging to the environment when it’s turned
off. '

Devonshire V

Knightley shines as Georgiana Cavendish
in the period piece “The Duchess.” The ﬁlm
recounts the story of the 18th-century wife of
\Wlliam Cavendish, Duke of Devonshire (Ralph
Fiennes), as she is forced to live as a prisoner
within her own home

Georgiana realizes, after less than a day as
the duchess, that the husband she was hoping
for will not appear in the form of the duke
His temperament is unruly and he is unfaithful,
yet as a woman  in the 17005, Georgiana’s
voice is stiﬂed within the vaulted ceilings and or-

i nate walls of their estate, forbidding her to act

against his injustices.

To the duke, Georgiana is nothing more
than the necessary instrument in ensuring a
male heir. But, adding considerable tension to
their relationship, the births of two daughters
supersede those of two stillborn sons, thwarting

the couple’s attempts at producing the next duke

As years pass, Georgiana’s‘ happiness fades,
while the duke’s alooﬁiess increases as quickly as
his accumulation of mistresses. His emotionless
facade is not only directed toward his wife, but
also toward the daughters he never wished for,

It is the acting, above all else, that ensures the

First-year coaches start making -

by Emily Steiner
Staﬁ’ W/rite/'

Partially through the fall sports
season, some ﬁrst-year coaches at
Pitt have already started making
their impact. Some have started
turning things around, while oth-
ers haven’t. Here’s a look at some
new faces in Pitt athletics and
how they’re doing.

Brandin Knight - Men’s Bas-
ketball [Assistant Coach/ Director
of Men’s Basketball Operations]

A graduate of Pitt and a
standout guard on the basketball
court, Brandjn Knight rejoins the
Panthers with a different point of
view this year. From 1999-2003,
Knight started at point guard,
scored 1,440 points and became
the school record holder in ca-

reer assists with 785. Along with
these honors, Knight was named
an All—American in 2002, All-Big
East twice, Big East MVP and
Most Improved Player (2001-02),
along with helping to guide Pitt
to its first Big East tournament
victory in 2003 and two Sweet 16
appearances.

After receiving his B.A. in his-
tory, Knight played two seasons
with the Asheville Altitude in the
NBDL before signing with the
Houston Rockets in 2005. An in-
jury two weeks later brought him
back to Pittsburgh, and he be-
came the program assistant/vid-
eo coordinator for Pitt in 2006.

Knight was promoted over
the summer, and he is preparing
for the start of Pitt’s basketball
season. Pitt’s first game is sched-
uled for Nov. 14.

Phil Bennett — Football [De-
fensive Coordinator]

Phil Bennett, who has a long '

history of collegiate football
coaching, joined Pitt’s coaching
staff in February. \X/ith stints at
Texas A&M, Texas Christian,
Iowa State, Purdue, Louisiana
State, Oklahoma, Kansas State
and Southern Methodist, experi-
ence is not an issue.

Coming into this season with
Pitt, Sports Illustrated named
Bennett one of the nation’s top
10 “impact assistants.” So far this
year, he’s continued to maintain
the Pitt defense as one of the re-
spected units in the league.

Over the summer, Pitt line-
backer Scott McKillop said the
toughest thing to do when adjust-

Penguins

by Jay Huerbin
Staﬂ Writer

The ' Pittsburgh Penguins
were one of four teams selected
to travel to Europe to participate
in the NHL Premiere Series.
Playing in back—to-back games
in Stockholm, Sweden, the
Penguins return back home with
a 1-1-0 record after splitting the
series with the Ottawa Senators.

(Pittsburgh 4, Ottawa 3

The 4000-mile trip to Sweden
didn’t seem to faze Pittsburgh
forward Tyler Kennedy this past
Saturday.

Kennedy, who worked his
way up the Penguins’ system
last season, earned an opening
day roster spot this season. He
needed less than a minute of
regulation to show Penguin
coach Michel Therrien that he
deserved it. ‘

His goal, 40 seconds into

travel to

the season opener, jumpstarted
a Penguins team that would see
back-and—forth action all game.
Witlt the ﬁnal minute of overtime
coming to a close, attention again
turned to Kennedy, who ended
the game on a wrist shot coming
down the left boards.

“If there is one guy who
deserved to score the winner, it’s
Tyler Kennedy,” said Therrien in
his post—game conference. “He
worked so hard again tonight, not
only offensively, but defensively
 He was an inspiration for his
team tonight.”

The Senators responded to
Kennedy’s goal in the first by
tallying one of their own midway
through the first period as Shean
Donovan tipped in a shot by
Dean McAmmond.

Evgeni Malkin gave Pittsburgh
the lead by scoring a shorthanded
goal 3:18 into the second period,
but back—to-back goals by Dany
Heatley and Jason Spezza gave

I)ear NCAA: Let's

  make a few changes

by Drew Singer
Contributing Egitor

Dear Friends,

It’s almost basketball season, and while
most of your student—athletes are getting

- ready for another exciting year of competi-

W

tion, Pitt forward Mike Cook — or should I
say, former Pitt forward Mike Cook, isn’t.

In case you forgot, Cook played in only
11 of Pitt’s 37 games last year because of a
knee  in a Dec. 20 game against Duke.
Despite the fact that injured players who play
fewer than 30 percent of a team’s games can
return for another season of eligibility, you
denied Cook’s appeal to do so, because six of
those 37 games occurred during the playoffs.
According to NCAA rules, those six games
do not count as six games toward the total.
Instead, of course, they count as just one.

While I expect nothing less from such a
notoriously compassionate and reasonable
institution such as yourself, I noticed a few
other rules that contradict the logical prem-
ise that six playoff games count as one. In
accordance, I humbly recommend the fol-
lowing NCAA rule changes be made:

Rule Change #1: Hockey teams can have
11 skaters on the ice. Maybe.

To the casual fan, it may seem like there
are already six skaters out there, but we’ll
leave that judgment call up to the profes-
sionals. Because six can sometimes count as
one, a hockey team can ﬁle an appeal to the
NCAA to have it review the number of skat-
ers it has in play. If your appeal is approved,
you can send five more skaters out there to
help your six, ‘er, one already on the ice.

Rule Change #2: Lower the SAT score
requirement to 137.

 

A high school senior with a 2.5 GPA cur-
rently needs at least an 820 [out of 1600] to
be eligible to compete in the NCAA. This
is totally unnecessary. Because a lot of the
games they’ll be playing — or not playing,
if they’re Mike Cook — only count as one-
sixth of a game, their test score requirements
should be lowered to one—sixth, as well. It’s
simple math. ‘

Rule Change #3: Sometimes touchdowns
should be worth one point.“

Sure, they’re usually worth six points. But
sometimes it would just be better if they
weren’t. It’s not fair that some teams can
score touchdowns while others can’t. So in
the spirit of fairness, touchdowns might only
count for one point when the NCAA says
so.

Rule Change #4: Baseball games are
shortened to 1.5 innings, but only in the
playoffs.

Because a playoff game is not as real as
a regular season game —— one—sixth as real,
to be exact — it would just be silly to waste
eVeryone’s time playing a game any longer
than one—sixth the regular length. And while
you’re at it  _

Rule Change #5: All postseason tickets
are sold for one—sixth the price.

Whﬂe we simple folk might not fully
understand the genius behind making six
postseason games count as just one regular
season game, maybe it would make more
sense to us if tickets cost a fraction of the
regular season price, too. \We’ll take your
word for it that a playoff game just isn’t the
same, but make the ticket prices reflect that.
Maybe you can send a free postseason ticket
to Mike Cook, because you certainly won’t
let him play his way there.

Respectfully,

Drew Singer

Pitt defense stays

Coaches, page 15

ing to a new coach is learning the termi-
nology. But the terminology is catching on,
and the defense is looking just like the unit
of old.

Holly Aprile — Softball [Head Coach]

After four years of working with pitch-
ers and catchers as an assistant coach with
Pitt, Holly Aprile became head coach of
women’s softball in _]uly.

Aprile was a member of the United
States National Team from 1993-99. She
was also an All—American pitcher and out-
ﬁelder at the University of Massachusetts
and former assistant coach at the Univer-
sity of South Carolina. Aprile brought a
wealth of knowledge to Pitt as an assistant
coach and watched a number of records
fall; Among them, Cory Berliner became
the ﬁrst rookie and Panther to win 16
games in one season.

Aprile hopes that her new leadership
role will continue the tradition but certainly
doesn’t see herself as the key player in Pitt
softball.

“I like to deﬂect things off of me,”
said Aprile. “We have an amazing coach-
ing staff, the team has been wonderful, and
the whole Pitt family has made everything
great.”

Though she’s worked as a coach in past
seasons, she says things have deﬁnitely
changed. With her new responsibilities and
new coaching experience, she hopes the
team will continue to improve and look to-
ward success.

“Our objectives are the same,” said
Aprile. “I like to emphasize effort, work
ethic and quality over quantity. I like to be
purposeful in everything we do, and not

clinical Trials  

strong under Bennett

just spend time out there [on the ﬁeld]. I
don’t like practicing without intensity.”

Kirsten Lawrence - \Women’s Soccer
[Assistant Coach]

Kirsten Lawrence joins the Pitt team
after spending two seasons as an assistant
coach at her alma mater, Campbell Univer-
sity. She was a member of the Atlantic Sun
Conference championship team in 2004,
and an assistant coach for women’s swim-
ming and diving.

Lawrence hails from Scotland, where

she graduated from the University of Ab— ’

erdeen and was also a member of the Un-
der—l9 Scottish National Team.

While she says things haven’t changed
that much, Lawrence feels she has much
more freedom as a coach here than at
Campbell. Also, she gets to spend more
time on the ﬁeld and with the players, even
though the program is bigger and much
more intense.

“Pitt is a really good environment to
work in,” said Lawrence. “I feel challenged
as a coach here, and all the staff is trying to
achieve a little more each time they play. It’s
a very competitive environment compared
to where I was before.”

Lawrence said she also feels that be-
cause her age is close to that of the girls
on the team, it allows some of the players
to approach her when they need someone
to talk to.

“Each new coach gives something dif-

ferent,” said Lawrence. ‘And as a player,‘

you don’t want a huge turnover there, but
I do feel that I give them a link between

the coaching staff and themselves that they,

didn’t have before.”

Penguins struggle on power play, drop second game

Pens, page .15

Ottawa a 3-2 lead heading into the third
intermission.

But the defense for the Penguinscame
up with some offense of its own from an
unlikely source, as Rob Scuderi scored his

third career goal in 220 games.

“It’s obviously been a while for me,”
said Scuderi following the game.

Marc—Andre ‘Fleury stoped 32 of 35
shots and earned the win.

“Since we’ve played them in the
playoffs the past two years, I think there
is a good rivalry between us,” said Fleury.
