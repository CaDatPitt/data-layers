Student Relations Group,
Attacked by,-_.Goldberg-; -
Discuss Rings

Plan University Dance

i

Senior rings, Student Relations
colnlnittee and University traditions
were among the subjects of discussion
taken up by _St.u,dent Council in a
sweeping consideration of campus
problems last Tuesday night.

Stirred into verbal action by a stern
reminder froln its president that it
must eithe-:1. “produce or get out,”
Council sought to correct conditions
which permit undergraduates, other
than seniors, as well as De1‘S0I1S Out‘
side the University to purchase
senior class rings Without first being
officially identiﬁed.

_ Upon the motion of Fanklin Kall-
felz, Eng., '33, a committee of three
members was appointed to confer
with Registrar Quick for the purpose
of drawing up s"o'm’e’ form of identiﬁca-
tion that may be presented by seniors
when purchasing-class rings. Kall-
1'e-lz was appointed chairman of the
committee, to be assisted by Bernard
‘Curran, Mines '32, and Arthur Gold-
berg, Col. ’33.

Check Relations Committee.

The suggestion from Goldberg that
the minutes of Student Relations com-
mittee meetings be read before Stu-
dent Council, as a more accurate
check on its activities, opened the
most lieated di.scu.ssion heard in coun-
cil sessions this year. " --

Charging that, because of its close-
ness to the Universitiy adnlinistration
Stlldellt Relations committee is lim-
ited in power, Goldberg declared that
more supervision of the committee
from council is needed. He voiced the
objection that too m‘l,1,_c,‘-.l_1 allthol'ity is
vested in'Student Relations as an ap--
pointed committee, and contended that‘,
the committee should be composed oi’!
members of Student Council.

“Council alone should represent the
student body to the -outside world,"
he said. “If 50 per cent of the stu-
dents were aware of the importance
of Students -Relations committee they
would wollder ‘v'v'l1‘a“t“ Student Council
was for.”

Kalifelz Answers Query

Kallfelz, chairman of Student Rela-
tions committee, met Goldberg’s re-
marks with the statement that those
representatives of the administration
who worked in conjunction with his
committee acted only as advisers, and
not as dictators of policy and action.

“Our work is so intimately linked
up with the University ‘officials, who
are ﬁnally responsible for student ac-
tivities, that we could not hope to
1'un(:tiou without their advice,” he ar-
gued. "The members of_nly commit-
tee are picked from the student body
at large for their capability, and natu-
rally are selected to a large extent
upon the recommendation of the ad-
ministrators who know them.”

Rose intervenes

After President Reed Rose had in-
tervened to halt the discussion until
a later meeting, Kallfelz, upon the
suggestion of Goldberg, was asked to
lualm a detailed report to council of
the business taken up by_hi_s commu-
ice at futui‘-e meetings. This action‘

.-nu.

* was taken after President Rose had.

pointed out that complete reading of;
the committee’s minutes would too!
greatly complicate council’s regularl
business procedure. l
0i:l‘ler business of the nleetilig in-E

George Baird, Originator, Tells of Ma.scot’s Beginnings
Back in 1910 When Pitt Needed “Tribal Totem”

 

By Adele Ash

\Vhen is a panther not a pantlieril When it is a hybrid between

a panther and a. lion.

Our moth-eaten beast does not really have a.

panther’s head, but now that he is g'oine; to get a new suit it is pos-
sible for him to have a correct head. If a “squeeze” were taken of
the head of the statue at the Schenley Park bridge we would have a
perfect head for our panther, according to George M, P. Baird, ’10,
originator of the panther as our mascot, now Secretary of the Art

Boggs, Col. '34, was in charge of the

Dunlzle Builds New Type
Of Electroplating Motor

 

Howard Dunkle, Metallurgy ’33. has
completed the construction of a, new
electroplating motor that will be used
in the department. The old motor
gave only about ten amperes of cur-
rent which was not sufficient to plate
chromium.

Dunkle, for his machine, has com-
bined the good qualities of both the
direct and alternating current motors.
Instead of purchasing new parts. he
took the motor from an old water
pump and set it up so as to have a
combined alternating and direct cur-
rent motor with the direct current
part acting as a. generator,

The chief advantage of Dunkle's
motor is the fact that it allows the
use of a much higher current or am-
perage. Now such materials as

.chromium, cadmium, nickel, and cop-

per can be readily electroplated."

Mr. VVi1lian1 Branch, instructor in
electrical engineering, supervised the
work of setting up the machine.

‘commission of Allegheny County.

On an October evening. in 1909, a
group of boys met. in the old Phi Zeta
Phi house on Center avenue at All-
quippa street for the express purpose
of getting college spirit and securing
some sort of “tribal totem” to repre-
sent Pitt. Suggestions made were
humorous and otherwise. They start-
ed with an elephant and....ended .witb

a horned toad. ‘The choice ﬁnally
narrowed down to the elephant. be-'

cause of its great size, the bison, be-
cause it was formidable and native,
and then, Mr. Baird suggested the
PANTHER!

Ah, the panther.‘ The panther was
the most vicious beast and it was in-

digenous to this region. Also, in the
vicinity we had Panther Hollow.
Then these ingenious young men

thought of the future sports writers--—
think of all the synonyms they would

have when they described the Pan--

ther’s victories.
It seemed that
many good qualities

the Panther had
which would
There was the
fact of al~literaiion——Pitt Panthers.
The next good point. tlie§,- thought of
was the color. The University colors
were old gold and blue. and the
tawny hide. of the Pantlier would be
grand for decorative purposes.

So, the panther was chosen. Sev-
eral of the young men in the group
that night whom we have to thank
are: John J. O’Conner. J11, ’10, man-

ager of the Fine Arts Department of

Carnegie Institute; Karl Davis, '10.
graduate manager of a.thlet.ic-.s at
Western Reserve; W. W’. Zeig, '10,
insurance broker, and George M. P.
Baird, who really suggested the pan-
tlier.

The first actual use of the Panther
came shortly after the meeting. A
blue banner about ‘six by ten feet with
a snarling panther head on it was
rigged behind the cheering bleacher
in Forbes Field. Then it was used as
a silhouette in “Courant,” the prede-
cessor of the “Weekly.”

seniors have the fewest possessions

, Since‘ the beginning of the semes-
ter more than 150 articles have been

ment, is greater than the total in any
similar period during any previous
year.

At present, in the shelf of unclaim-

three of which are volumes of Chau-

Eight bracelets, one a valuable dia-

In the other are such articles as four
scarfs, two sets of keys. belts. ear-

and the most uncomfortable contrap$

Goldberg reported that $19.46 had
been collected in the drive for funds
to purchase a new suit for the Pan-

when the drive was conducted, it
would be impossible to replace the

These Boys Call 'Em Right

 

Local Writers Prove Something In Foretelling Panther Vic-
tories; Ohio State Game Caused Greatest Worry

 

Picking winners week by week during a grid season by sports
scribes general)-‘y show the old adage, “Fool rush in—.’’ The win-
ner in each instance and those more harl_v writers who attempt t.l1e
prognosis of games more than three hours off generally ﬁnd them-
selves woefully bogged in the sea. of wrong scores when reports

come in.

But to three local wi.-iters, who, at the behest of the Pitt News,

took unto thems_elves the task of pre--3,

dieting how the Golden Panthers
would perform in their ten games,
goes the blue ribbon of perfection.
Outside of a. few “on the fence” de-
cisions, Jack Sell. of the Post-Ga-
zette; Lester Beiderman, the Pitts-
burgh Press; and Jess Carver. _the
Suii—Telegraph, went through Pitt’S
season undefeated, so far as errors
go.
Calls ’em Close

Sell played no favorites in the Ohio
State and Notre Dame but wrote ‘Tin

their game against A1'mY becallse
-they made the soldier boys look so

In the other games, Sell made 110
reference to the Stanford game, but
predicted victories by_Pitt over Dil-
quesne. ‘West Virginia, and Ohio
Northern. _

“The games Pitt must take special
care in preparing for are thenoiies

Hogan's Kicking Puts Coast
Team On Defense

 

 

Pitt ﬁnished its season iindefeated
after capturing its ﬁnal game from
Stanford 7-0 before 40,000 fans who
braved the cold, outplaying their op-
ponents more than the score indi-
cates.

Pitt scored early in the game as
the result of a seventy-yard boot by
Bobby Hogan, quarterback. which
was downed by Ted Dailey on the
Stanford one-foot line, followed by
some fine plunging and running by
VVeinstock, Heller, and Sebastian and
a twelve-yard bullet pass from Heller
to Daily on fourth down. Heller car-
ried the ball over with a drive out-
side of tackle. From then on it was
simply a case of Hogan keeping the
Cardinals continually on the defen-
sive with his accurately placed kicks.

The statistics of the game show

Pitt. to have been overwhelmingly su- .

perior t.o their west coast opponents.
Stanford failed to make a first down
until late in the fourth quarter when
they caught Pitt momentarily off bal-
ance and gained forty yards on three
successive plays: a. faked kick. and
two forward passes. Stanford showed
a meager total of less than 20 yards

Misses But One

But the third of this triiimvirate,
Les Belderman outdid himself in
prognosticatlng the success of the
Panthers. He predicted easy vic-
tories over Ohio Northern. Vvest Vir-
ginia, and Duquesue. favored Pitt
by a shade, and wrote
that “the. Buckeyes, with one of the.
most powerful teams in its history,
should cause Sutherland his first
sleepless night this one is a
tossup. If everything goes right and
the boys build up for this one, the
Irish are liable to ﬁnd themselves on
the outside looking in.” Did every-
thing go right? Penn, at Philadel-
phia, he predicted would go to Pitt,
but erred believing that the boys
could mark up another one at Ne-
braska. Since "Jock relishes vic-
tories over ‘the old man,’ Les gave
the Panthers a. shade over the 111-
dians.”

C. A. Smith, Perry High Coach,
Uses System Learned At Pitt

 

Collegiate football champions who
made use of the Warner system in ac-
quiring their titles do not hold a
monopoly on its use by any means,
as the case of Coach Chester A.

Smith demonstrates.
Coach Smith, who guided the Perry

High School gridde‘rs"‘to their"ili'st'

city football championship this year
learned his football fundamentals
under “Pop" VVarne.r in Warner's
first year at Pitt, 1915. The knowl-
edge gained from the old “Fox” he
incorporated into the championship
play of the Perry outﬁt.
V Use Basic Points _

Smith makes use of the single wing
back formation for the most part,
but used the double wing ba.ck to
good advantage in winning- the cham-
pionship from a. favored Westing-
house crew. "Most high schools in
this district use portions of the VVar-
ner system,” said Smith, “but at
Perry we disregard all the fancy
frills and use only the basic points,
which have proven sufficient to win.”

In 1915, Smith held down the diffi-
cult job of fullback on the freshman
team under the able tutelage of
“Pop” Warner and Andy Kerr. At
the time, the Pitt coaching staff was
not so complete as it is at present,
and individual instructions were
given to each player by Warner.

A broken leg, coupled with a doc-
tor’s warning to stay away from foot-

ball ended Smith's football career,

but’ didinot prevent him from earning
two varsity letters in wrestling at
Pitt.
Continues to Study

To make. his knowledge of the
Warner system. more complete, Coach
Smith has been a frequent student
at the, suninier coaching sessions
held by Sutherland yearly» As is the

«case with Sutherland and other users

of the ‘Warner system. Smith has
made a habit of developing fast
wingnieii and backs. This year, in
winning the championship, his team
showed themselves to be real ball
hawks by recovering every fumble
made by their opponents in the
championship game,

Coach Smit-.h’s -=niain "contention
seems to be “a good passing attack
and a good off-tackle play- will help
to win ball games moi'e than any-
thing else.”

VVith the end of the football sea-
son, the .greatest season for “cry-
ers" can now get under way with the
picking of the various “All-American"
teams by various experts (?)

The New York Sun, which possess-
es one of the finest sport staffs in the
U. S. A. picked Heller as the out-
standing halfback lri the country on
its All-American. No other Pitt
man was mentioned.

The INS, a news service comes out
with the good news that Heller and
Skladany have been placed on their
first team.

Edd.le..Dooley, who used to be
somewhat of a footballer, plastered
the air waves with an All-American

team that was heralded as THE
team. Once more Heller was given
a post.

Dan Parker, who writes sports for
a New York tab, placed Heller and
Skladany on his All-American team.

Ted Husing, _of the Hahva-hd Hus-
ings, braved the ire of the radio fans
by nam-ing.a “Radio” All-American

consisting of those he had seen in
action. The first team included Wal-
ton and Dailey.

Another raddio artist, whose name
escapes us at the moment put Skla-
dany and Sebastian on a mythical
All-American, and Heller on the sec-
ond team as Sebastian's understudy.

All of this dope proves nothing.
More and more All-American teams
will be forthcoming. We’ll try to keep
in touch, but it looks like a hard
winter.

Another bulletin that just arrived
gives the All-American team as pick-
ed by Parke H. Davis, official foot-
ball liistorian. No Pitt men are men-
tioned. Waas you dere Chollie?

For the first time in Pitt football
history, unless I'm wrong, a Pitt cap-

tain witnessed his final collegiate
game from the Press box.
Now that the footfall season is

over, it seems a shame not to spend
a few hours listening to Harry Conti
tell of the four encores he was called
upon to sing at the Helping Hand.

|. Dean Clothier's Successor
, INE months have passed since Dr. Robert C. Clothier vacated his

position here as dean of men to become president of Rutgers Uni-
versity. Since the time of his departure the duties of the dean ’s office
have been faithfully and expertly discharged by ‘ll-Valter J. Rome, as-
sistant dean of men, and Theodore VV. Biddle, assistant to the dean of
en. Vile of the student body and student activities have reason to
make that :st~atenrent.

But that is but part of the idea we would like to convey to the ;

persons who may have some part in the selection of Dr. Clotliier’s
.success-or. _ I .

This is .a plea for consideration of a Pitt man for that office.
‘When that appointment is made we would like to see someone of the
outstanding members of the faculty or administration ﬁll the vacancy.
And our reason for so urging is one that only a Pitt man,.,ca.n_fully.
understand.

Chancellor Bowman has stated several times that jtlie futures of
many American universities will be determined by what they accom-
plish or fail to accomplish in the next decade. How truly this applies
to the University ’s future in the next two to five years!

Pitt, more than any other university in the country, is in a pro-
cess of change. With the nearing of the goal of physical achievement
has come the growth of a new student attitude, a spiritual develop-
ment that niust be fostered and cared for now if it is to survive.
Th-at attitude and the tremendous import of its effect upon the Uni-
versity‘ man can only be appreciated by one who knows and has
known the University of Pittsburgh.

To the undergraduate the dean of men should be an interpreter
of the 7University and its meaning; to the Chancellor and the Board
of Trust.ees he should be the iiiterpreteiz-' of the undergraduate, the
“studen "’ in their midst.

If we are to have a successor to the ofﬁce of dean of men, we sin-

cerely urge the consideration of a. member of our own facultv or
administration as the logical and most desirable choice.

 evidence that some members of Student Council are tak-
ing their Jobs seriously was oﬂered at last week"s-meeting of the
campus governing body.

At a meeting which had ﬁrst promised little more than the usual
legislative lethargy, an energetic minority called up for discussion
some problems worthy of more than just casual consideration.

. Recognition of the fact that senior rings, through a careless sell-
mg plan, have lost their identity with the senior classand have come
to be worn by almost any resident of Greater Pittsburgh, stood out

as a display of intelligent concern on the part of the ten members
present at the meeting. There is no reason to doubt that -the con-
ditions permitting such a ﬂagrant oversight will be corrected by
Council. ’ '
If  sincere interest of Art.liur.G_rol.dberg in strengtliening student
-I+‘!aC-‘l1t1OIlS through class orgaiiization in the College and the Schools
0. lilducation and Business Administration is likewise deserving of
praise. Anyone williiig tdunclertake a job of such proportions must
feel the responsibility of his power of representation. If some of his
enthusiasm and drive could be transferred to those of his colleagues
who have as yet failed to a.nal_yze the reasons for their election, Presi-
Cl8lc1l”,.,ROSe would not have to repeat his warning of “produce or get

But with Goldberg’s declaration that the committee should be

Student Relations should remain a unit apart from Council, insofar
as its membership 1S conceriiecl. And the reason again is the very
importance of the committee.

The sales tax and the people who
boost it so avidly are really nothing
to get excited about. There is little
chance of a’ revenue bill'whic1i in-

ing passed in the Lame Duck session
of the old Congress or the later ses-
sion of the new Congress. And even
;if such a tax law is passed, its life
‘will ‘certainly be a short one.

But in the present crisis with reve-
nue measures, that have until now
proved satisfactory enough, giving
way under the stresses of economic
diseqilibrium, it is natural that legis-
lators and public alike should begin
grabbing for straws. No wonder then
that individuals who would privately

that go with one should begin propa-
ganda. -iii its favor.

Last Vvednesday iii -a daily Pitts-'
burgh newspaper, famous aniong
other things for its support of such a
gmetliod of raising revenue, there ap-
‘peared an editorial entitled “Gi'een’s
,Oppos-ition To Federal Sales Tax
1Hurtful To Labor.” Now Vvilliam
lGreen as president of the American
Federation of Labor has not alwaYS
been the most pugnacious opponent
of the woi-kiiignian’s enemies; but so
long as he opposes a. federal sales
taxfl am sure that lie is earning at
least part of his salary.

How Shall Tax Be Levied?

The simple fact that-most discus-
sions of a. sales tax overlook, so far
as I can see, is that the whole ques-
tion is one of how taxes shall be lev-
ied. In the United States as in al-

1

Inside Loo

.government costs, but

most every other country, the first
principle of this problem is that taxes
shall be levied on individuals.acc_oi'd-
ing to the ability to pay. It is upon
this altogetlier fair principle that our
income tax laws are and have been
based. It .is no exaggeration to say
that a. man whose annual income is
twelve million dollars can afford to
turn six million into the federal treas-
ury as his just share of the cost of
national government. And it is
equally fair‘ that a niari'ied person
with an annual earned income of
three thousand dollars should be ex-
empt from federal taxes, as*wa_s~tlie-
case under the 1928 law.

A general sales tax takes no such
consideration of an individual’s abil-
ity to bear the burden of goveriiment
costs. t is levied on consumption.
And levied thus, it fa.lls as heavily on
the poor as on the rich. In fact, it
falls more heavily on those of the
small income groups, for they, living
on the border line of poverty as many
of them do, must spend all their iii-
comes to keep alive.

A Tax On Poverty

'We are having diﬂiculty enough
keeping our poor a.live without put-
ting a tax on poverty. To say that a
general sales tax would not affect the
unemployed and those living on an
income below the standards neces-
sary for health and decency (and
those people were many in the “pros-
perity” of the ’20’s), is pure rationali-
zation. I wouldii’t even take up space
on this page answeringsucli an ab-
surd contention.

Right now the forces for and
against the sales tax line up on two
rather well deﬁned sides. There are
the 1lllll‘l0l1a.ll‘eS and their satellites

_ who favor replacing the old income

tax with a general sales tax. Their
reasons are evident enough. They
can afford to pay -for‘ a‘ large’? share-. of

they would
rather do something else——spend their
moiie-y for Hispano-Suizas, for in-
stance. Against this array, which is
organized -under various patriotic
names, are the spokesmen for the
rest of us. These men and women
know that those who can afford to
pay are obligated to do so.

Rich Against Poor.

In plain words-, it is the rich against
the poor. Such terms mean very lit-
tle, however; for it is to the interest
of the average man (the two to three
thousand dollar a year man, which I,
and you too, if you aren’t a complete
egotist, expect to be) that the pres-
ent tax set-up be preserved.

The question of a general sales tax
versus an income tax as a revenue
raising metliod is not simply a na-
tional one. In May of this year, the
state of Mississippi instituted a gen-
eral retail sales tax as an emergency
measure. The. efforts of our own
state government in this direction are
well enough known.

The proponents of this tax are
often apologetic in their statements
to the extent that they favor it as an
emergency ineasiire. That sounds
simple enough. But once such a fis-
cal policy is undertaken. the reaction-
ary elements, we may well believe,
will ﬁght for its retention. In con-
junction with this eniergei'i(.-y meas-
ure type of argunieiit, the faults of
our income tax system are exposed to
some abuse, mostly undeserved. It
is pointed out that our income tax
has been in the present. crisis “coni-
pletely inadequate.” "Well, perhaps it;
has. But what taxdesigned for oper-
ation in times-. of abnormal prosperity
could work satisfactorilv in times of
abnormal depression‘? Likewise, the
red—tape and bother in the collection
of the income tax are under ﬁre. But
the tax that does not involve red-tape
 so far as I know, yet to be dis-
covered.

Income Tax Unsatisfactory

Against the -income.-I tax‘-it is charged
that the instability of its revenue
makes it unsatisfactory. It is quite
true that incomes. mbve downin times
of depression, making any propor-
tional part of them less. But there is
no evidence to assure us that sales
and a return on a pl‘ODOl‘l;l0lll1l part
of them remain constant in good
times and bad alike. As any cliild
knows (but appareiitly some publish-
ers don’t), the volume of sales varies
quite widely. To quote the Federal
Reserve agent of the New York Fed-
eral Reserve District, “The total Jan-
113»1‘.V (19323 sales of the reporting
wholesale ﬁrms were 21. per cent'be-
low a year ago . . .” Your spectacles
will have to be a deep pansy pink to
see any indication of iiisured revenue
from sales in that statenient.

"As Isaid above, there. is little
chance of the adoption of a general
sales tax by the present or the incom-
ing Congress. The members of the
House and Senate. are to solicitous of
the support of the ordinary voter to
disregard his wishes to that extent.
And StI‘aI18‘e1.V enough, the ordinary
voter is acting quite wisely in the
present business. But. in the mean-
time we had better keep thumb to
nose at all times so as to be in posi-
tion for ﬁiigei"wa_g'gling..at those who
are trying to foist on us the belief
that “Gi'een’s Opposition To Federal
Sales Tax ls Hurtful To~'Labor.”

for the Paiitlieifs, while the superior
line play of the Navy and Wilcox’-s
exceptional line running counted
heavily.

Ruff scored both touchdowns for
the Panthers and Wilcox duplicated
for the Midshipmen. Brown missed
one of his placement tries for goal,

last week.

Piper spoke on “Enzymes in
Ontogenesis” to a group interested in
physiology, last Wednesday, review-
ing the literature on the'su-bject. His
talk dealt with the enzymes in"tlie
embryo that in adult life will carry on
digestion.

Mr, Spiker discussed “The Develop-
ment of the Parasitic Wasp” in

Heald Addresses Oil Gas
Seminar on 0. I. Industry

Dr. Kenneth C. Hezild, staff geolo-
gist of the Gulf Oil Compaii_v, spoke
to the oil and gas seminar Wednes-
day morning on “P1‘oi'atioii in the Oil
Industry.” Proration is the govern-
mental restriction of the amount of
oil that a well may be allowed to pro-
duce.

In his speech, Dr. Heald showed‘.
that he does not.-oppose proratione
that has for its purpose the preven-
tion of strictly physical waste. How-
ever, he did express his opposition to
pi'oi'a.tion when its purpose is the
ﬁxed rate of dislzributioii of oil on
the market. Dr. Heald also favored
allowing ovei'productioii to provide
tli"e necessary curtailment by lower-
ing prices.
