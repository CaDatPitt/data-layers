A group of students gathered to
write, edit and produce their own
student newspaper. Entitled The
Free University Press, it pledges
to print ”Some of what The Pitt
News will not print,” and arouse
social consciousness for such is-

Jay Katz, president of the Stu-
dent Action Union, contributed
material for the newspaper. He
said that members of various
groups put it together because
they had trouble getting coverage
from The Pitt News.

”The Pitt News was con-
strained by covering events such
as basketball games and spring

break f|ings,” Katz said. ’’We

-wanted to focus on more serious
issues.”

Katz said that 1,500 copies of
the newspaper, which contains
no advertisements and is free to

the public, were printed. He also
explained that it was ”funded by
the campus community.”

”This newspaper was entirely
privately funded,” Katz said.
”The money came from people's
donations. Not a cent came from
the university or the Student
Government Board.”

One of the events promoted in
the publication was a rally by the
Central American _Peace Coali-
tion that will take place on Satur-
day, March 18. The march will
begin at 11 a.m. at the Software
Engineering Institute.

The front page story of the first
issue printed this year concerned
a march in Pittsburgh that will
take place on April 15, ”Tax
Day.” The rally will promote
decreases in defense spending
and increases in financial support

_for the homeless.

The issue also included stories
about the United States’ involve-
ment in Central America and the
effects of glasnost on American

policy.

Pitt students got a taste of the
Pittsburgh mayoral campaign last
night in the form of ball point
pens, combs, buttons, literature
and fire side chats. They also
learned about the candidates.

Four of the six candidates par- ‘

ticipated in an open forum last
night in the Kurtzman Room of
the Williarn~~Pitt Union. A

During this week, women are
encouraged to use all of_the YM-
CA’s facilities, including handball
and racquetball courts, swim—
ming pool, indoor track for jog-
ging and running, nautilus
weights and lifecycles, as well as
participate in the aerobics class-
es. There are a variety of class

times throughout the day.

”People aren't as involved in
fitness anymore,” explained
McMichael, ”because it's not a
top priority in their [lives].” She
added that a ”conscious effort of
setting aside a certain amount of
time each week for exercise”
must be made for complete
success.

rum began. Also present were
Frank Lucchino and Thomas
Flaherty.

Candidate Gary Henderson
was not present for unknown rea-
sons and incumbant mayor
Sophie Masloff refused to commit
herself to what she felt would be
”another debate,” according to
Moderator‘Donna Walker. Mas-

loff said that she has decided to‘

partake in only two debates dur-
ing the campaign.

, Members of the College of
General Studies Student Govern-
ment Council, who' sponsored

the forum, had set up two tables
covered with lavish cloths on

H each side of a podium to accomi-

date the candidates. But with the
starting of the event already a half
an hour late andseveral of the
candidates still not present Luc-
chino told the small audience to
”gather around for a fire side
chat.” '

All of the candidates stressed
the importance of creating a
strong neiborhood environment
within the city. ‘

”Out of all of the cities in the
country, Pittsburgh has, the largest

 

percentage of people who were
born and raised here and have
decided to stay,” Lucchino said.
’’I want my children to be able to
stay here.”

He explained that the next
mayor must help create more
jobs and economic development
in order to keep the neighbor-
hood structure strong. _

Holding a celery stick in his
hand, dark horse candidate
Brown said that the current tax
structure of the city is running
people out of town.

He said that taxes paid by resi-

at with Pitt students

dents can be reduced by cutting
costs in running the city. This me-

ans ruducing the payroll of c.ityV_"l

government employees, he said-

Flaherty who debated Brown A

on this point said, ’’If you cut the
payrole are you going to find jobs
for those people you have cut
from the payrole.”

Murphy said that he would
stress ‘home grown opportunity if
elected.

’’I want all of your to be en-
trepenuers. I want you to create
opportunity here,” he said to
students.

Death penalty proposed in drug-rela ted crimes

HARRISBURG (AP) ~ Gov.
Robert P. Casey urged legislative
leaders to take swift action on a
series of drug-enforcement bills
yesterday, among them I a
proposal to permit the death
penalty for drug-related murders.

The bills the governor outlined
are a collection of bipartisan
measures proposed by himself,
the state attorney general and
legislators, which show the s 
means business in its war aga
drugs, according to Casey. ' "

”As soon as you pass them, I'll
sign them,” Casey told a number
of Democratic and Republican
legislative leaders who joined
him in support of the bills. ’’It’s
important that we give the attor-
ney general, the police and the
courts all the tools they need, and
give those tools to them now."

The governor endorsed con-
cepts such as mandatory life-in-
prison terms for three-time felo-
ny drug offenders; the use of the
Pennsylvania National Guard to
help customs officials search for
illegal drug contraband; and mak-
ing it easier for law enforcement
agencies to computerize and

NEWS BRIEFS

Although legislators present at
Casey's announcement said they

had not individually reviewed all ~

of the bills, they supported
Casey's plans to bolster drug en-
forcement efforts in Penn-

psylvania.

”We stand prepared to work
with you side-by—side,” Senate
Majority Leader Robert Jubelirer
told Casey. ”We’re wading into
shark-infested waters here and if
we want to embrace [these ef-
forts], we're going to have to
make a funding commitment.”

Q

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, March I5, I989

By Scot Ross

News Editor

Al Todd chalks his cue stick
and drives the white ball off the
red one. The white careens into

. one, two, three rails and taps the

second white ball. Tom ”Toad”
Rossman grins and says, ”Nice
shot.”

Nice shot, but where is the
"plunk” of the ball dumping into
a pocket? In fact, where are the
pockets?

”lt’s the game of three-cushion
billiards,” explains Todd. ”The
object of the game is to make
your ball contact the other two
balls and three cushions, but you

0 must contact those three cushions

before the second ball.”

Todd, a 21-year-old Pitt stu-
dent, stole a few moments from
The Hustler as he challenged
Rossman, a 39-year-old profes-
sional billiards player and trick
shot artist, to a friendly game in
the William Pitt Union Pool

oRoom yesterday.

Todd comments on his formid-
able opponent: ”A|though to
most people these games seem
boring, you have to have a spe-
cial skill to play them, a special
ability, and he sure does have
that ability.”

Rossman laughs as Todd con-
nects his second point, ”Make
sure you make a note that I've no

oints so far. I'm setting a new
record here.”

Todd explains that this contest
will last until someone has
reached 15 points.

”This game dates [way] back,
farther than the game of pool

‘ does,” Todd says. ”What hap-

pened and why there are pock-
ets on a pool table is [this]: in
England, they decided to make
obstacles. The idea ‘was not [to]
get the‘ ball in the pockets. Even-
tually, the game of pool devel-
oped from this.”

Rossman connects with two
points. Score tied at two.

In 1983, Rossman competed in

A France with the top players in the

world. He says that it was not un-

usual to see players run nine
balls, as opposed to regular play-
ers who, with luck, may muster
three or four in a row.

The world record stands at 17,
demonstrating the difficulty of the
sport.

Todd has been playing for two
years and is considered by some
to be Pitt's best three—cushion
shark.

Rossman began playing at
Eastern Illinois University where
he received a degree in business
management approximately 20
years ago, leaving the sport to es-
tablish a business in Decatur, Ill.
After a five—year hiatus, however,
Rossman returned to his roots
and began competing profes-
sionaly.

Todd says that mastering three-
cushion can make ordinary pock-
et billiards ”a piece of cake.”

Rossman: ”What’s the score?”

Todd: ”You’re winning, 5-4.”

The thrill of trick shots has
drawn Rossman away from
steady three—cushion tournament
play. His primary billiard interests

.The Panther versus the Pro
Trick shot artist and student face off  

involve trick shot exhibitions and
competitions. 5

”My main areas of concentra-
tion now are in artistic billiards,
[trick shots] and bank pool,
[when] you bank every shot,”
Rossman says. ”The eight—ba|l
[competitions] played out in Las
Vegas were primarily [composed
of] qualifying tournaments at lo-
cal levels, state levels and region-
al levels, and then you get to go
to Vegas. Well, I got to go to Ve-
gas, and I usually finish within the
top 30 to 40 players, and that
would be out of about 600.”

Rossman increases his lead to
7-4. ’

The small crowd that gathered
laughs as Todd asks Rossman if
he had wanted to play to 15 or
50 — an inside joke to three-
cushion players, as that score
could take professionals several
hours to reach. _

Todd says, ’’I was born in Lake-
wood, Ohio, where my dad origi-
nally started playing this game.
He learned from someone who
had come over [from across the

Atlantic]. You can take some
professional pool players and
[have] an average three-cushion
player  beat them silly.”

Rossman pulls away, 13-5.

According to Rossman, the
challenge in the game appeals
the most to him.

’’If you get a table that plays ex-
actly according to angles, you
can use a mathematical ap-
proach,” says Rossman, who has
completed a book on the analyt-
ical aspects of pool shooting.

”There [are] about 40 mathe-
matical systems that I use in a
game when there are perfect con-
ditions,” he says. "It's the analyt-
ical part of the game that I enjoy
most.”

The crowd stares as Rossman
cracks his 14th point. Adding
some chalk to his stick, he racks
the winning point.

l’You want to play again, Al?”
Rossman asks.

causes dealt with in a rally publicized by the group,
not the expressed standards for the publication. But they
reflect the issues that are in the paper.

Oh yes, there is one other concern that these writers
have: the incompetence of The Pitt News.

In the section entitled ”What is The Free University
Press?” there is a clear statement of what it intends to
achieve. It states, ”Often students are unable to learn

about events and subjects which concern them in their

campus newspaper. FUP hopes to fill thatlarge void,

, at least temporarily.”

Later in the paragraph, the FUP states that it ”does
not feel the responsibility to do The Pitt News’ job.

That's good. Because it does not.

What it is doing is providing a newsletter —— not a
newspaper —- for special interest groups whose favorite
issues coincide with their own. The writers are not
reporting the news. They are not trying to inform the
public about what is going on at the University of

' Pittsburgh.

They are providing a forum — a soapbox, if you will
-- a platform from which they can champion their
views. And that is perfectly acceptable. The First Amend-
ment allows and encourages it. But it is not journalism.

The Pitt News receives hundreds of press releases,
sent to its news department, every week. They range
from on-campus organization events to city events and
programs. All of these people want coverage. Unfor-
tunately, all of these events cannot be covered. ,

The size of our paper is controlled by our finances,
and the size of our staff. We are not capable of cover-
ing everything that happens on the campus of the
university and in this city. That would require a paper
of immense size, larger than the Press, larger than the

ter decisions than we could if we’

were in his shoes. Even the most
intelligent person, however, can
be closed-minded. Therefore, po-
litical appointees do not neces-
sarily perceive the political
motivations of the Soviet Union
in a way that is necessarily more
”correct" than how you or I may
see it. Yet, these perceptions form
the foundation of foreign policy.
For example, the ”best and the
brightest” in the U.S. government
during the 1960s erroneously
perceived the conflict in Vietnam

_ as orchestrated and motivated by

the Soviet Union, operating
through its Chinese and North
Vietnamese minions. The conflict
was thus seen as one step in a
strategic plan of the Soviets to ad-
vance their quest for world domi-
nation.,On the other hand, those
involved in the peace movement
on U.S. college campuses who
saw it as an indigenous Viet-
namese civil war were proved
correct. Unfortunately, the U.S.
withdrew only after losing
58,000 men, wasting $250 bil-

Apparently, even the Bush ad-

clusion. Indications are that it will

not seek renewed military fund- _

for this funding. '

What suddenly transformed the I

Sandinistas from a major threat to
our national security into some-
thing less than a major foreign
policy concern? Nothing. The
Sandinista regime in Nicaragua, at
present is the same one that Rea-
gan confronted when he came
into the office. Is Bush therefore
terribly mistaken in failing to ap-
preciate the continuing threat to
our national security posed by the
Sandinistas?

I believe that the answer is that
a major threat to our national
security from the Sandinistas
never existed. The terrible irony

It absolutely appalls me the
way you generalize all Crreeks as A 

years ago if the United States had
not begun massive funding of the

an military.

Instead, the result of the $3.4
billion that the United States has
spent in the country has been a
military stalemate that has lasted
seven years. Even with all of thi
aid and pressure from the Unit-
ed States, right-wing death squad
activity is once again resurging.
Also, not one military officer has
been brought to trial for any of
these deaths.

PERSPECTIVE

- I \

THE PITT NEWS

It's time to bid a fond farewell to

The question before the world
is what to do about the Aytollah
Khomeini and his satanic curses.
Two points are clear: Civilized
nations lose dignity and self-
respect when they permit them-
selves to be held hostage to such
terrorist acts as Khomeini’s issu-
ance of a death threat against
Salman Rushdie, author of ”The
Satanic Verses”; and procrastina-
tion in dealing with this threat
will only encourage more outra-
geous behavior from the Ayatol-
lah and his crazed followers.

CAL THOMAS

A key tool for dealing with this J

situation -may already be in place.
It is the National Liberation Army
of Iran. . '

The NLA, the main opposition
to Khomeini’s rule, has demon-
strated on several occasions that
it is an effective fighting force.
Made up of an estimated 35,000
soldiers (including large numbers
of female combatants), the NLA,

At 1 a.m., Monday through Fri-
day, he opens the closets in the
Cathedral of Learning and goes to
work.

He usuallywears a thin, dark
blue sweater with its right pock-
et" stuffed with a pack of
cigarettes. His shoulders are
slouched, and his eyes aregare

qiidden beneath swollen rings of
‘ skin. He moves quietly with his

broom and mop among the scat-
tered tables in the Cathedral's
Commons Room. Most students
remain still, staring down at their
books .5 he shuffles by.

I don't remember what morn-
ing it was last week, but it was 10
a.m. when the megaphone woke

‘ me up. And I thought people
slept in during ‘spring break in«

Daytona Beach.

LOU GRIECO

Employees of Chrysler Ply-
mouth had sponsored all sorts of
promotional gimmicks during the
week, and they were advertising
their. latest this morning. Students

vwould have the opportunity to

form a Plymouth logo on the
beach, which would be aired on
television commercials.

I probably shouldn't admit this,
but I was tempted not togo, even
though I was covering spring
break for The Pitt News. Another
cute public relations gimmick
didn't seem newsworthy to me,
but my roommate was the editor
in chief, and he wanted me to go.

9 When I reached the lobby of

the hotel, I heard one of the secu-
rity guards’ radios crackle: ”Go
upstairs, someone’s wakingour
guests with a megaphone... never
mind, it's one of our people.”
The business side of spring
break may be forgotten by stu-
dents, but not by the companies
who sponsor the games and con-
tests the students participate in.

V-D So I stood in the cold (the bad

weatherhad arrived), watching
students sit in the sand, providing

, free _advertising for the new

based in Iraq along the Iranian
border, liberated the town of
Mehran last June 19. According
to an NLA spokesman, Khomei-
ni’s forces suffered 8,000 casual-
ties, 1,500 were taken as POWs
and $2 billion worth of tanks,
arms and ammunition were lost
in that battle.

Last July, the NLA mounted.
”Operation Eternal Light,” a
I50-kilometer thrust into Iran,
which the NLA said resulted in
55,000 Iranian casualties, a num-
ber equal to the total of American
dead in the entire Vietnam War.
That battle is thought to have
caused Khomeini to break his
pledge never to agree to a cease-
fire with Iraq.

Khomeini’s response to con-
tinued NLA threats has been
predictable. An NLA spokesman
says the Ayatollah has killed
90,000 people he considered
enemies of the revolution,
I2,000'of them since last year.
He has reportedly jailed 150,000
of his opponents.

I've seen his face for four years
now on the nights before my ex-
ams and have never taken a
minute to ask his name. He rare-
ly makes a sound except for a few
gargled coughs now and then.
His head is lowered as he sweeps
away the cigarette butts and can-
dy wrappers underneath my ta-
ble, and” I"watch his broom‘
manauever itself around my feet
without ever grazing them. His
work lasts for a couple_ hours, and
once the entire room is glazed
with soap and water, he dis-
appears.

Plymouth Lazer. It took them an
hour to find enough students will-
ing to leave the sanctity of their
beds. Then a helicopter appeared
and took pictures of the ”human
|ogo."

Though there were representa-

. tives of many companies in Day-

tona, the huge Miller Beer
carnival tent across the street
caught my eye, and I went there
after the excitement of the
Plymouth activity. '

It was Miller, you may remem-
ber, that contributed a complete-
ly idiotic insert about spring
break to The Pitt News. Judging
by the promotional flier, the peo-
ple who designed it felt that
modern college students had in-
telligence levels comparable to
that of Cro-Magnon man.

Susan Henderson, Miller's mar-
keting public relations manager,
seemed to expect my questions
about the flier.

”We received comments from
all over the country, saying that
the insert was sexist, juvenile and
irresponsible.” she said. ”I was
able to stop it from running in 10

~ of the 65 publications it was sup-

posed to run in, and I sent an
apology letter to the publications

- who ran it. J
J ”Of course, we are trying to ’
market our product to people

who are old enough to drink it».
We also. recognize that our
product isn't soda pop, so we

need to _ advertise, responsibly/’..

The time for the West to strike
against Khomeini is now. Rarely
have Western European govern-
ments been so united as they
have in their rejection of the
death threats against Rushdie. Af-
ter working for nearly a year to
improve their economic and po-
litical ties with Tehran, some Eu-
ropean nations have recalled
their ambassadors. Now Khomei-
ni says it was a mistake to reach
out to ”infidels” in the first place.

So what can be done?

Step one in bringing down the
Ayatollah and his Middle Ages
mentality would be for the Unit-
ed States and the rest of the free
world to recognize the Iranian
resistance. As has been the case
in so many countries, a legitimate
revolution in Iran was hijacked
by a fanatical leader, Khomeini,
who turned out to be worse than
the regime he replaced.

Step two would be the break-
ing of diplomatic relations with
Iran by as many countries as pos-
sible. Now that Iran has started

MARC DUCHIN

Two weeks ago, as I crammed
for my mid—terms at my usual
Cathedral table, I noticed that he
had left early. Ten minutes later,
a large yellow machine entered

t_he_,C,0mm_o_ns Room, -operated‘

by what looked to be a student.
The machine rumbled past me,
followed by a wide path of

polished stone. It cleaned faster,-

better than an ordinary mop. Af-
ter about 30 minutes, it complet-
ed its job, and.\l wondered where

she added.

Sure enough, there was no beer
in the tent. Pamphlets promoting
alcohol awareness were at a near-
by table, and the slogan ”Think
when you. drink” was on the
walls. ' v —

Henderson maintained that the
ad was designed as a ”parody”
of spring break, and shouldn't
have been taken seriously.

Of course, Miller has no choice
but to address the issue of drink-
ing in Daytona. But what about,
Plymouth?

While I had been watching the
students line up to form the logo,

I had a chance to talk to l

Plymouth’s National Merchandis-
ing Director Mike Coughlin, a
quiet, older man and the last type
of person I expected to see at my
hotel.

”We promote the sports‘con-
tests,” he said, ”and we en-
courage [students] to join
[Students Against Drunk Driving].
We are in no way promoting the
use of alcohol.”

The interview went well until
I remembered what the mega-
phone had blasted at me: ”Come
form a human logo. Twenty-five
cent drafts for those who par-
ticipate." T

”That wasn't us, that was the
hotel,” Coughlin growled as he
hurried away from me.

Basketball fanatic Khomeini issues
more threats against lousy teams

This just in off the wire —- after
years of reading the Los Angeles
Clippers box scores, known as
The Catatonic Verses, the Ayatol-
lah Khomeini, a self-pronounced
basketball buff, has issued a
death warrant in an act of disgust
with the team, calling the Clip-

is staying out of this one.

in his spare time.

me holler, I get fed to do the Wild

Panthers face the tough

role of theunderdog in

this version of.Tourney

By Matt Martin

Sports Editor

NCAA Tournament time is
here again, and for the third con-
secutive year the Pitt Panthers
have made the field of 64.

But the Panthers, seeded eighth
in the Midwest region with a
I 7-1 2 record, are not in the same
position they have been in the
last two seasons — that of a
favorite. They find themselves fill-
ing an unaccustomed role.

”I guess the NCAA picked us
as a spoiler or something," Pitt
center Bobby Martin said, ”so
we'll go out and spoil
something." I

Spoiler or not, the Panthers are
not just content to be in the tour-
nament, where they will face
ninth—seeded Ball State Thursday
night in Indianapolis.

”This is it,” Martin said. ”lfwe
don't win, the season is over, and
I don't think anybody wants the
season to be over.”

”We’re not _just happy to be
there,” forward Rod
added.

While Ball State, the regular
season and tournament champi-
on of the Mid-American confer-
ence, may not be a marquis
name, they have put together a

I5—game winning streak and
compiled a 28-2 record, both
representing national bests.

The Cardinals are ranked fourth
in the nation in scoring‘ defense
(60.9) and field goal defense
(40.6), and regularly use nine
players. ’

The Panthers have become a

'six— to seven—man team, with

Brookin and guard Pat
Cavanaugh coming off the bench.

Broo_kin ,

Statistics, however, do not im-

press this Pitt team, which got its

first look at Ball State on film ‘ 3

Tuesday‘ morning.

’’I don't think we're going in
[afraid] of them,” Pitt Coach Paul
Evans said. ”We have played
stronger competition.”

The strength of Pitt's competi-

tion is the foremost reason that

the Panthers find themselves in
this year's tournament. The Pan-

thers upset Oklahoma, Syracuse, .
, Georgetown,

Seton Hall and
Florida — all tournament teams
— and also played postseason

competitors Robert Morris, Siena,. ' f;
Providence, West Virginia and-7"‘
Arizona on their way to a fourth— ‘ 
place finish in the Big East con- ‘ 

ference.

”For a group of sophomores, I I I

they're playing pretty well,”
Cardinal Coach Rick Majerus
said of Pitt,‘which starts five
sophomores — forward Brian

For the second straight year,
Pitt volleyball ‘standout Denise
Frawley has received Honora-
ble Mention on the Volleyball
Monthly All-America team.

, Frawley, who paced the
Panthers with 283 kills
on the year, was also selected
to the All-Northeast region
team as well as being named_
MVP of this past season's Pitt
team.

Despite arthritic feet which
often prevented her from prac-
ticing, Frawley, in her four
years at Pitt, became one of
the dominant hitters, in the col-
legiate ranks.

Co-captain Kelly Matheis
observed, ”Denise is one of
the best hitters around. If not
for her feet, she might have 
—,been even better and gone. a_“;

Tight end Tanczos wins a ward for
outstanding grades in economics

By Ed Kuznik

Staff Writer

Pitt's David Tanczos, a junior
on the football field but a senior
in the classroom, was given this
year's Economics Award, signify-
ing the best performance of an
economics-business major at PHI

’’I came to Pitt planning to take
athletics seriously and academics
seriously,” said Tanczos, who
was a backup tight end on the '88
Panther squad. ”And I think I've
managed to do that. I came here
my freshman year planning to
graduate on time, and I've done
that. I did have fun playing ath-
letics.”

Tanczos was redshirted his
freshman year and has one more
year of eligibility left on the foot-

ball field, but he has chosen to
tuck his degree away come April
and set out to find a job in the
real world.

”This is just a personal prefer-
ence,” Tanczos said. ”l’ve always
felt that college is a four-year
thin , and I wanted to take my

'fif’tI‘/1’year with football in gradu-

ate school if I were going to do
it any other way. But I always
wanted to keep my options open
— I don't have to do anything
right now.”

Indeed, Tanczos will graduate
with a spectacular 3.99 QPA. Out
of seven total semesters (not in-
cluding the current Winter Term),
he piled up six 4.0 terms, and in
the remaining one he was dealt
a devastating blow: an A— in a
western civilization class.

0 There's money available for students who have been newspaper car-

”That threw a monkey wrench
into the whole thing,” he said
with a laugh.

’’I don't consider myself a per-
son who locks himself in [his]
room or the library and studies all
day long,” Tanczos said. ”My
friends can attest to that. I think
the thing that basically does it for
me is that I go to class. I just try
to never skip and keep up with
my classwork. I don't think I do
an overabundant load of work,
though.”

Tanczos has a brother, Dan,
who played for Notre Dame, and
said that was a factor in his deci-
sion to come to a major Division

’’I’m an intense person to
start with, especially toward
volleyball. Once practice
starts, I am ready to go,” said
Matheis.

Sheils came to the Lady Pan-
thers from Onondaga Junior
College in New York state,
and the transition was any-
thing but smooth. A severe an-
kle sprain suffered in
preseason practice sidelined
her for Pitt's first three games.

Once Sheils’ ankle healed
she saw limited playing time
as she attempted to make the
transition from junior college
volleyball to the NCAA Divi-
sion I level.

Around midseason, Sheils
emerged as a player capable of
dominating play. In _Pitt’s up-
set of 15th-ranked Arizona,
she tallied 21 kills.

Against archrival Penn State,
Sheils powered 25 kills against
the Lady Lions.

Reflective of the way she
raised the level of her play,
Shei.ls was voted most im-
proved player by her team-
mates. Possessor of a
power-laden backrow spike as
well as a wicked top-spin
serve, she will be ready to go
next season.

Volleyball I

”In junior college we knew
we were the best in the region;
at Pitt we have to work to be
the best,” noted Sheils.

Pitt sophomore Jenelle Lan-
tagne received the Coaches’
Award. In addition to being
responsible for her own per-
formance, it is Lantagne’s
responsibility as team setter to
have the Lady Panthers’
offense running in high gear.

Lantagne stepped into the
starting role for Pitt and
emerged as arguably the finest
setter in the east.

In the Big East champion-
ship match against Syracuse,
Lantagne clearly outplayed the
Lady Orange's regional selec-
ti_on Sherry Cowling.

She had 37 assists to Cowl-
ing’s 21 as the Lady Panthers’
offense bombarded Syracuse
in three straight games.

"When reflecting on her per-
formance this past season Lan-
tagne observed, ”I think one of
the main things [Coach Shel-
tonlCollier] gave me was a lot
of confidence in myself. V

’.’When you aresetting you '
have to be confidentbecause I

the rest of the team is looking
up to you. Indicative of how
I perform is how the team's
offense runs.”
