Chemical Engineering
Department Head .
Dies at Home Sunday

Funeral services for Dr. Harri-
son Collin Bashioum, professor and
head of the chemical engineering
department, will be held tomorrow
afternoon at 2 o'clock from his
home, 6552 Northumberland
Street.

Heads of departments of En-
gineering and Mines have been
notiﬁed to hold no classes after
12:30 o'clock tomorrow.

Oﬂices, classrooms, and lab-
oratories will be closed. This does

_not excuse students having non-
engineering or mines classes.

- Dr. Bashioum, who died at his
home Sunday afternoon at the age
of 54 years, had been head of his
department for the past 20 years.

Born November 4, 1884 in Old
Bethany, Westmoreland county,
Pennsylvania, he was graduated
from the University in 1905. Sub-
sequently he worked as a research
engineer for the H. J. Heinz com-
pany, and later established his own
research laboratories.

In 1918 he returned to the Uni-
versity to become head of the de-
partment of chemical engineering.
He was a member of Sigma Tau,
honorary engineering fraternity;

Appears Monday

With a three-color cover fea-
turing the cheering block and
four additional pages, bringing
the total up to 36, the Pitt
Panther will bring its October
issue on to the campus next Mon-
day, Tom Smith, C39, acting edi-
tor, foretold.

Additions which the Panther
has made to its style and size are
part of a “bigger-better” policy
for this year, Smith declared. If
possible the book will again be
enlarged, and color and more
campus photographs added on
the inside pages.

October's issue will include the
regular column “Tempo,” a
novel wonian’s style page, and
several feature stories, includ'ng
Frank Miller’s investigations on
an empty pocketbook.

Students are invited to con-
tribute to The Panther. All ma-
terial, or opinions on The Pan-
ther (which are welcomed if
signed) should be submitted to
the Panther office, 801 Cathedral.

 

C & 6 Club Extends
Final Script Deadline

Since none of the six scripts
handed in for this year's Cap,
and Gown show was submitted
in complete form, time for com-'
pletion and resubmittal has been
extended until Monday, Novem-“
ber 28, according to Theodore R.
Biddle, graduate manager of the
Cap and Gown Club.

Students who have not entered
a script as yet and wish to do so
are asked to prepare a complete
script with dialogue, short synop-
sis, and musical stops.

‘N o Corsage’ Plan Arouses
Discussion over Soph Hop

The class of '41 affair will

be held at the Hotel Schenley,

the date will be this Friday night, entertainment will be by
George Hall and Dolly Dawn and her Dawn Patrol, and
tickets are priced at three dollars a couple.

The fact that Wally
chairman of the dance, and Edgar
Cooke, business manager, have an-
nounced a no-corsage policy for the
traditional, formal party of the
sophomore class will make Friday
night's dance a distinctive one.

Hirsch and Cooke say, “We think
that;.the no-corsage policy will. pop-
ularize the dance. The absence of
corsages won't detract from the
formality of the affair.”

Mr. Biddle, who started the no-
corsage movement in SFA, seemed
“surprised at the action of the
committee in terms of SFA’s atti-
tude.” He was referring to SFA’s
defeat of his motion. “But their
action must indicate the general
feeling of the student body," he
added. “The no-corsage idea must
be a popular one."

Miss Amos, who advocated main-
tenance of corsages at the SFA
discussion, said yesterday, “I don’t
quite see the right of any organi-
zation, whether large or small, to
say what a person should do with
his funds, once he has purchased a
ticket. If I were approaching the
problem of popularizing the dance,
I certainly wouldn't attack the
beauty of the dance, but I would
lower the price of admission to as-
sure a greater attendance."

 

Drs. Williams, Elsbree
Talk to Peace Council

Discussing the “Munich Accord,”
Dr. B. H. Williams, professor of
political science," and Dr. 0. W.
Elsbree, associate professor of his-
tory, will speak tomorrow at a Pitt

ecutive architect of the Cathedral,

John Martinco, C39, and
Jay Reich, BA39, have been
appointed editor and business
manager, respectively, of The
Pitt News, it was announced today

ment confirms their appointments. _.-

Concerning the future make-up

,of the News, Martinco said today,

“The tabloid format will not be
permanent. Plans are being com-
pleted to return to a large size
paper, and resume a tri-weekly
basis within the next few issues.
Until printing arrangements have
been completed, the News will con-
tinue to be issued in tabloid size."
This will be Martinco’s fourth
year on The News staff. As a
freshman he served as a reporter,
and during his sophomore year he
worked on the copy desk. Last year

We Write An Obit 

On Interim Issues

FFICIALLY, today’s News marks the
end of the anonymous “interim issue”
policy which has ‘been in effect for the past
six weeks. Editor and" business ‘manager have
been appointed, and the _“go ahead” sign has
been given for organizing staff and paper
on some sort of permanent basis. _ .
Technically, however, much remains to
done. Printing. contracts, heretofore effected
on an issue-to-issue basis, must be let on
yearly basis, and other mechanical arrange-
ments must be completed. All of which puts
our printer friends in somewhat of a hole,
not at all unlike the cavity from which we
of the editorial and business side, have been
struggling to emerge. 9
Net result is that this week's issues re-
main under a tabloid format, and on a semi-
weekly basis. But within a week or so, _all _in-
dications point to resumption of publishing
a larger-size newspaper, with a probable
return to the more logical tri-weekly fre-
quency in the near future. -  - - ~
Ontthe editorial end, we, of course, have

A

haphazard organization-during the pastqfew
weeks, and "by lack of space. We Vhopesoon,
however, to be able to resume the news cov-

widelrecognition,aand toaugment these with
the introduction of new and individual compo-
nents, so necessary if a newspaper is to con
tinueas a dynamic, living in’ﬂu‘e‘n‘cc.
To sum up our position, we might draw a
i°ather‘i‘obviou§' comparison, likening our‘-

selves to.a runner in a handicap race. We,‘

through no choice of our own, have been
forced to7start far behind the pack. We,‘like
the runner, will be putting everything we
have into an effort to pull up with the rest

can do it,'especia_lly if the spectators will be

Mice in the Cathedral are helping to bring better
healthaand longer life to man. The rodent life-savers
in the better-health-to-man campaign are members
of a mouse. colony ‘. in the University’s department
of biology“ :.-    y  » «. .

They. are a select group of mice, too. An alley
mousewithout a pedigree would never be admitted.
Those ~aristocrats« of ' the mouse world are albinos.
By inbreeding, a uniform stock has been obtained
which isessential for scientiﬁc observation.

A thousand‘ baby mice are raised each year by the
University's biologists. The colony has between 600
and 650 adult mice-;"‘tagg‘ed” for experiments.

Already used,-for innumerable scientiﬁc studies,
msnyof these‘m,ice will be “test tubes” in experi-
ments _to__throw more light on the way in which
iodi,ne~"jé_.ffects health through the thyroid gland.

If is'-accepted by science today,‘ University pro-
fessors ‘claim, that a deficiency of iodine in water
and vegetables causes goiter. The less iodine in drink-
ing’ water in .a‘ particularéregion, the greater is the
number of «goiter oasés.—.-- 

Mice are important in this study because the thy-
roidsof mice and .men are similar in structure and
function. Whatever" discoveries are made in the
study “of the mouse’s thyroid will, naturally, be of
value to human beings. ‘ -

University professors and graduate students are
checking reactions to iodine in the thyroid cfimice
and are also studying the effects of heat, cold, and
deﬁcient diet on the glands which so easily upsets
bodily health and nervous equilibrum when it fails
to function normally. ,  J

INTELLIGENCE VS, JOBS
R. M. Hutcliins, president of University of Chicago:

“Collcges_which' want ‘to teach young people how
to live an ‘examined life may disregard the business
ihdexo Whether jobs” arescarce or plentiful, the coun-
try will wish to be intelligent. In the light of what
his ,hsppene'd in certain impoverished European
countries, it may be that intelligence is most im-
portcnt whenjobs are scsrcest."

  MARQUEE
. by Bill Collier
Pittsburgh Playhouse

Modern drama may be turning from propaganda
plays to comedy, but if you want to see a dramati-
zation that will make you think of something older
than that blonde you met during rushing, go to “lt
Can’t Ha-ppen Here.” Better still, take her along
with you.

This adaptation of Sinclair Lewis’ novel pulls no

punches in its vehement condemnation of dictator-
ships. Vivid are the scenes depicting the terror that
strikes a small-town newspaper editor in Vermont.
It's powerful stuff.
.- Ed -McAdams, formerly of Pitt Players, and Rob-
ert McKee, both graduates of the University, have
prominent roles. They turn in excellent characteri-
zations.

Penn  

“Sing You Sinners” with Bing Crosby as the
singer, is the best of the crooner’s pictures. He has
the naturalness and informality that most actors
lack.

The story tells’ of the Beebe ‘family and its no
‘count son, Bing, who has the uncanny ability of not
ﬁnding a job. As a result, Fred MacMurra-y, Bing’s
brother, can't marry because he’s supporting the
“fami'ly."Complications set in when Bing acquires a
swap shop and swaps it for a race horse.
Stanley

“Hard to Get,” sporting lovely Olivia De _Havil-
land and Dick Powell, doesn't have a novel story
(spoiled young heiress meets gas station attendant)
but it's good for a couple of laughs. Charles Win-

ninger.as-_Olivia’s father is constantly engaging in '

athletic contests with his butler‘ who invariably beats
him. ~

Freddie Bartholomewis‘ the stage offering, trying
to appear as much this side of thirteen as possible.

I’m not blaming actors who are sent on tour by
their companies. They have to, in order to fulﬁll con-
tract agreements. But they don’t act and -they cer-
tainly‘ aren't worth fifty cents to look at. You can
see them any day at your neighborhood theater for
half that amount, and probably on a double bill, too.

“The Affairs of Annabel" is »a pretty successful

"the role 'ofla rapid talking press agent who, with

Deans’ Annual Fraternity

Betting Spree

Status Quo Has
Nothing on C, B, W

The unprecedented number of 4
acceptances, combined with the»
unusual difference in the total
amount of bids and the number of
individuals bid enabled each dean
to win one of the three parts of
the wager on recent fraternity
rushing results, and so the whole
thing ended in a tie.

Edward B. Williams came clos-
est to the actual number of
pledges, guessing at 185. The ﬁnal

f.\

count was 206. Theodore W. Bid- ‘ 0

die prophesied the closest number
to the individual men bid, and
Roberx_’R,__Corley almost hit the
jackpot with the actual number of
offers made by the Greek houses.

Additional pledges released by
Mr. Corley, some of whom pledged
earlier in the semester, include:

James P. Hughes, Phi Kappa;
iienry Nimrod, Sigma Alpha Mu;.
A,  Ce;'<.*e1'i:3, Pi Kappa Aip;2a;;

Scoring Spree Ends Pitt,
Ram Pointless Years

No inhibition was ever over-9‘ . ..

come with more assertiveness
than was the repressed scor-
ing urge of zero-complexed
Pitt and Fordham on Octo-
ber’s ﬁnal Saturday afternoon
in one of the most interesting
psychiatric clinics that has
been held in Oakland’s rapid-
ly-growing medical center.

Early in the ﬁrst quarter the
Panthers overcame their point-
suppression. But, they struggled
for three full quarters to free
themselves of that inability to
touchdown. Then they burst. And
when normalcy was restored in the
overﬂowing bowl, it was discerned
that Pitt had erupted with 24
points and that the Rams from
Rose Hill had shook themselves
loose for 13 tallies themselves.

Less than nine minutes after the
ﬁrst kick-off, the scoring drought
was ended as Bullseye Bill Daddio
sent a place-kick directly between
the cross-bars from the 12-yard
line. This ﬁrst play was set up by
a bobbled Fordham punt.

Kazlo’s kick slid out of _bounds
on the Ram 24-yard mark due to
a poor center pass. Cassiano cut
thru right tackle twice to bring
the ball down to the 15-yard stripe.
Goldberg then accelerated thru
center to the 10. Stebbins brought
the ball around the left side and
got as far as the 6. When the
Fordham front line showed signs
of granite, the ﬁeld goal “became

expedient. Daddio’s aim;  with
Goldberg holding, was true. ‘
RAMS TALLY

This play brought three point-
less years to an end. Fordham
ﬁrst came to the realization that
it was high time something big in
the way of points was about to
be accomplished. The Rams ob-
tained the ball on Pitt’s 38-yard
line when Ted Konetsky tried a
little too ardently to bring down
a Fordham punt-returner.

Len Eshmont, fast-moving Ford-
ham back, was handed the ball
from a Statue-of-Liberty forma-
tion and he raced around right end
until Stebbins forced him out of
bounds on the 1-yard line. Hearn
skirted the other end after receiv-
ing a lateral for the touchdown.

Thus, the score was 7-3 when
the fourth quarter began. Goldberg
had just made it a first down on
the Fordham 23-yard line as a tre-
mendous P a n t h e r surge had
brought the ball that far.

Dr. Sutherland sent Ben Kish in
at quarterback at the beginning of
the last period. He had instructions
to call two plays. The ﬁrst, an off-
tackle slant, to get the position of
the ball closer toward the center of
the ﬁeld. The second play was the
famous “Penn State sneak.”

These were the plays that Kish
called. On the second one Stebbins
was given the ball by Cassiano and
he circled wide and deep around
the left side while the interference
was going in the other direction.
Stebbins was ﬁnally downed on the
8-yard line. But, this was the play
that won the game.

SCORING STARTS

From this point, the Panthers
became nothing but scoreable. Cas-
siano wentaround, without bene-
ﬁt of interference, for the ﬁrst
Pitt touchdown. Daddio came
through with the extra point and
it was 10-7.

A few minutes later, after an
illegal pass had been attempted,
Pitt was 24 yards away from the
goal line. Cassiano, Stebbins, Gold-
berg, and Goldberg made up the
difference. Pitt’s ﬁnal touchdown
was made on a drive from the
Fordham 37-yard line after a re-
covered fumble. This time it was
Goldberg passing, Goldberg slash-
ing thru center, and Goldberg go-
ing over for the score.

Eshmont threw a flat pass to
Fortunato that was good for more
than 60 yards to complete the
Fordham pointmaking.

Highpointing the game was the
tremendous efficiency of the Pitt
offense once It was organized and
the perrect play of Marshall Gold.

MARSHALL GOLDBERG
. . . his play was perfect . . .

berg. During the first half, Pitt
\vasn’t able to get organized. The
stubborness of the Fordham de-
fense and also its defensive style
were the reasons.

Goldberg's ball-carrying and ex-
ceptional blocking were all that
could be asked from the nation's
greatest football player. Daddio,
Hoffman, Stebbins, Lezouski, Petro,
and'Bob~ Dannies all contributed
much to the victory.

According to the Pitt team,
Fordham’s line was every bit as

‘ rugged as--the famed"“seven"blocks

of granite.” Berenzy and Jacunski
at end were exceptional ball
players.

Harriers
Win Again,
Beat Rams

Pitt’s fast-stepping cross-coun-
try stars added another victim to
their long list, on Friday, when
they swamped the Fordham run-
ners by the perfect score of 15-40'
on the Schenley Park course.

So one-sided was the contest
that Pitt’s last runner had ﬁnished
and was getting dressed when
Fordham’s ﬁrst runner crossed the
finish line. In a dead heat for ﬁrst
place for the Panthers were Walt
Sterner, Jimmy McCabe, Al Bou-
langer, and Casimir Kopec, all
four holding hands as they broke
the tape.

Behind them came Captain Al
Zamborsky, then Bill Nurmi, and
last was Ben Kopec for the Pitt
team, while Richard Peterson was
ﬁrst for the visitors.

The winning time of 27 minutes
and 45 seconds was fairly good
for the 4% mile course consider-
ing that the Panthers were not
forced to exert themselves to any
great extent.

Coach Olson was well pleased
with the running of his boys, es-
pecially Jimmy McCabe, who
shows considerable improvement
with each meet. Also outstanding
was the running of Casimir Ko-
pec, one of the mainstays of last
year’s team, and Al Boulanger,
whose powerful physique and ex-
ceptional stamina stamp him as
one of the most promising distance
runners in the country.

For the beneﬁt of those who do
not know how the score is deter-
mined in a cross-country meet,
here is an explanation: Only the
points gained by the ﬁrst ﬁve run-
ners of each team are counted.

The runner who comes in ﬁrst
gets one point, the second to ﬁn-
ish gets two points, the third three
points, and so on up to 10. If
the ﬁrst ﬁve winning runners are
of the same team, they are’ given
15 points, while the other team re-
ceives the points for the next ﬁve
positions which, when added up,
total 40 points. The low score wins
and the perfect score is 15-40.

THE PI‘l"I' NEWS

decided in both the Independent
and Engineering Leagues today and
tomorrow as intramural touch foot-
ball enters the last full week of the
regular season.

Two of the strongest clubs in the
Independent ranks tie into each
other at 4 o’clock this afternoon
when the Newman Club meets the
Floogies in the ﬁnal match of the
winner's division. Johnson, Burke,
Ellis, Kristufek and Company must
be rated favorites over the Floogies
on the basis of their play so far,
but the two teams are well enough
balanced to come through with a
lively battle.

Not quite so close a game is ex-
pected in the Engineers’ fracas as
the Mettallurgists, easy winners in
their ﬁrst three engagements, are
heavy favorites over the Civil Engi-
neers. The CEs stayed in the upper
bracket the hard way, edging out
both the Chem Seniors and the
Chem Frosh by one touchdown
margins.

Captain Al Ackenheil and Bill
Smith have been the big noises in
the CEs’ drive. Smith was on the
receiving end of an Ackenheil
aerial to score the only touchdown
of the Chem Seniors game, while
Ackenheil gave a one-man per-
formance in the Chem Frosh
scramble. And it was a scramble.

The CEs came out on top in one
of the most cockeyed games of the
season, the Chem Frosh skidding
by a 15-8 count. The Frosh cut
loose in the opening minutes and
for a brief time looked unbeatable
as they drove toward payoff land.
But the Engineers braced, held,
and started a drive of their own
that brought results.

Ackenheil accounted for 15 of
the 23 points scored as he breezed
over twice for six-pointers, booted
a point after touchdown, and was
caught behind his own goal line for
a safety. Fillep went over for the
Frosh’s touchdown while the alert
CE line nabbed Simpson behind the
Frosh goal for two points.

Intramural Touch Football
Reaches Final Stages

Winner's bracket victors will be 6‘

Electrical B faces the winner of
the Chem Juniors—Industrial Engi-
neer match on Friday in the top
game of the loser’s bracket, the
victor battling the loser of the
Mets-CE game on November 8. The
winner of that game will meet the
leading team of the winner’s di-
vision on November 9.

Returning to the Independent
League, the Ramblers struggle with
the loser of today's Newman-Flow
gies match on Wednesday at 4
o’clock. The winner will stack up
against the remaining winner's
bracket nine on November 7.

Plans for the cross country run
at Schenley Park on November 16
continue as the ﬁnal date for en-
tries draws closer. All teams enter-
ing the meet should ﬁll out entry
blanks and return them to the In-
ramural Office, Trees Gym, by 6
p.m. on Friday, November 4. Any-
one desiring detailed information
regarding the race can get it at
the Intramural Oﬁice.

 

Hockey Team
Drills Progress

_ The hockey team, continuing
light conditioning scrimmages for
the past week, yesterday went thru
more shooting and maneuvering
practice with stress being placed
on fundamental defenses.

Absent from the line-up were
last year’s two leading scorers,
center, Dick Friday, and left-wing,
Bob Schooley. Friday, suffering
from a bad cold, has been tempo-
rarily forbidden from practice by
Dr. Carlson. Schooley, in the ﬁrst-
scrimmage of the year, pulled a
ligament in his right knee.

Announcing, that within the
next few days the squad will be
cut to approximately 20 players,

Coach McSorley promised to then
;begin the hard work-—-that of pre-

paring for John Carrol.

Fordham Seniors
Lose Capsule Bet

Senior students in the School of
Pharmacy at Fordham university
will be busy for some time as a
result of a bet made on the out-
come of the Pitt—Fordham game.

The Fordham Pharmacy’ School
wired a bet of 500 hand—made cap-
sules for each student that Ford-
ham would win. Dr. C. Leonard
O’ConneIl, dean of the University
School of Pharmacy. Wired back
that the number ‘should be 5,000.

‘So, the Fordham ‘seniors will
each have to make 5,000 capsules
by hand. The capsules will contain
iron and ammonium valorate, the
familiar “dead rat” odor of "stink
bombs. It’s good training for the
future pharmacists, but it will take
long hours.

Students Celebrate Victory
Despite ‘No Holiday’ Ruling

To Disrupt Schedule

The ﬁnal score was 2-1 to 13,
and it seems that the 24 points be-
longed to Pitt. To make sure that
everyone in this district knew about
the above facts, a portion of the
student body took to the open road
yesterday and celebrated an “unau-
thorized” holiday.

During tht first and second hours
classes were disrupted by groups
of celebrants and the holiday was
on. There is no truth to the report
that the Pitt Players staged this
demonstration to publicize their
performances of “Holiday” this
week.

A parade of approximately ﬁfty
cars, some carrying as many as
8 or 10 students, toured the down-
town area, and the campi of PCW,
Mount Mercy, Tech, and Duquesne.
The racket of h orns, bells, and
sirens disturbed the peace of many
a classroom.

Despite the announcement by
President Downie of SFA and the
efforts of administration ofﬁcials,
yesterday added another holiday to
the list of major football victories
celebrated on the Monday after the
game.

It hasn’t been learned yet what
the celebration accomplished, btu
Coach “Jock” Sutherland had this
to say yesterday, “They are helping
Tech beat us Saturday.”

Evidently “Jock” meant that the
ﬁaunting of our victory on the
Tech campus yesterday only made
Tecl. more determined to beat Pitt
next Saturday. It is the opinion of
the coaching staff that the Tech
team will be a stronger opponent
than any Pitt has met so far this
season.

In football, the backﬁeld gets the glory.
Is it fair? What makes a great football
team—the line or backﬁeld? And which
would you prefer: a great backﬁeld and
a mediocre line, or the other way around?
Coach Jimmy Conzelman, who fears no

shows you why. Here’s his story, and we
hope he isn’t stuck with it!

Diamonds

We can't ﬁnd anything that Con-
fucius said about diamonds——but
then even we can't think of any-
thing after seeing eighty-three in
he circle of light which is the
bracelet for Miss Grace Quil’s
watch. And as she lifts her hands
to the keyboard of her typewriter,
a diamond ring on the right ﬁnger
sparkles merrily. Mr. Wong was
the right man for Miss Quil and
the package was air-mailed a week
ago Saturday. There has been a
constant trek to the Dean of Wom-
en's Oﬁice. Grace will “altar” her
name in the Spring.

Collembolae, honorary natural
science fraternity, seeks new lau-

Junior Class
Increased

There were never so many sopho-
mores and seniors belonging to the
Junior Class before as at the Junior
Hallowe’en party. Only the fresh-
men thought better of removing
their armbands and joining in the
fun of pinning tails to donkies,
ducking for apples, drinking cider,
hav-ing their fortune predicted, and
crunching candy.

The Sophomores followed the

afternoon when they had a turtle
race at their Hallowe’en party.
Three little turtles, Ike, Mike, and
Dunky, were in a maze. The girls
tried to feed the turtles apples,
peanut brittle, and chicken corn.
And they ﬂavored their water with
cider. Have you ever seen dipsy
turtles?
