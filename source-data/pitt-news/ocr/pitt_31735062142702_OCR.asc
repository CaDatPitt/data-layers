 Gaeth Defends
N urenbergWar
Guilt Verdict

~' Claims Nazis Regard

"Criminals as Heroes
Arthur Gaeth, the only Ameri-
' can broadcaster to witness the re-
cent execution of ten N/azi efﬁcials.
 _-ﬁpresented a capsule account of
 ,what happened in Nurenberg to
Q 'a capacity. crowd in Stephen Fos-
. ter, memorial last Friday. His ad-
dresslwas spiced with numerous
sidelights that occurred during
the trial and ‘the night of the ex-
ecutions. . *
_ " ‘In defense of the trial and ex-
 ecutions, Mr. Gaeth answered the
- - major criticisms gaised by the
 P world. He also explained the aims
7 _ of, the United Nations in trying
a war criminals and said that the
 Nurenberg trial established a pre-
cedent~that, if successful, will ﬁnd
isjuustiﬁcation in history. .
‘  Defends Court’s Authority
.The biggest criticism, according
-"to Mr. Gaeth, is whether or not
 the United Nations had the juris-
' diction to try the accused under a
, law that did not exist. In answer
to this he referred to the Hague
‘ treaty; the Geneva conference, and
. “the Kellog-Briand pact against
’ gaggressive warfare.
' “The Nazis violated all three of
these and this provided .a basis for
,,-trying them in a court of law,”
Mr,7 Gaeth asserted. “The U.N.
createda court to try them but
it'*did not createthe law.” _
A Y Since no neutral countries were
, represented with judges in the
 . courts, the speaker reminded that
,a state of war still existed when
the trials began. . A
Y _ 'RecordsUnusually Complete
_; ,1 Referring to the length and pro-
"  duo‘: of the trial, Mr. Gaeth said,
‘ “I do not believe a more adequate
grec_ord- has ever been kept by a
. _ group, party, or government than
 the one of this trial. Nearly ﬁve
million words had to be translat-
ed into three languages; 5959 doc-
_ uments were presented by the
A 5 prosecution alone. Of these docu-
ments, 90 per cent came from the
mouths of the defendents during
the Nazi reign of persecution.”
Because the name of the Mutual
Broadcasting network was drawn
from a hat when the time arrived
to determine who would be the
1 only radio representative at the
‘ executions, Mr. Gaeth, the Mutual
commentator at the trials, was se-
- lected to inform the American
 V public of the details. Later he was
offered $1000 by one of his col-
leagues to relinquish‘ his position,
but refused.

Vets Discuss
Housing Ideas,

Social Plans

Housing, streetcar passes, vari-
ety shows, boxing smokers and
dances were the subjects discussed
by the Pitt Veterans association
at its first general meeting last
Friday in Soldiers and Sailors
Memorial hall. The meeting was
presided over _by John Grimes,
president, and Stewart Work-
master, vice-president.

Alan Dahlgren, housing direc-
tor, answered such questions as,
“Why Pitt has no federal hous-
ing on its campus?” and “Where
and how vets, can obtain the
housing they need?” ‘

Dahlgren said that last August
an eight man committee, appoint-
ed by Chancellor Fitzgerald. de-
cided that Pitt did not need Fed-
eral housing because the Univer-
sity was ab1e'to ﬁnd suitable lo-
cations for all of its students. He
added that the city of Pittsburgh’s
housing authority is anxious to
have veteran students living in
its various plans.

Larry Gibson who is social
chairman of the group then said
that the Vets have completed all
plans for the coming Pigskin
dance, Nov. 19, and only a suit-
able location is holding up the
boxing smoker. An evening dance‘,
_a variety show, fashioned after
the “Vet’s Revue” of last spring,
and ’a‘ spring formal are on the
tentative listrfof social events for
the coming year.

Pitt Men.”

Dear Editor:

Do you know what happened"

should they. ‘When our ‘football
team left Pennsylvania station at
9.230 for -Bloomington, Indiana, of-
the 8000 do-y students at Pittabout

ball. -, ’
As Wes Fesler said, “Without

any good.” And he is 100 per cent:
right. Last week more than 6900

students cheered the Panther’s

stunned in the last few seconds
‘of play. Yet they were willing to
have the team leave with only -a
handful of students to wish them
luck; '.

Of the 30 students who did ar-
rive, a large number lived 20 or
miles from campus and missed
their dinners at home to see the
team leave. A Pittsburgh reporter

was at the station to cover the

story and nothing happened to
make it worth his trouble. Where

were the students who live on cam-

pus‘? Where were the students who

to send our team to Indiana with-

by David Barbour

A worthy man once said he
didn’t have to hear both sides of

an argument. His theory was that
if he heard one side, he knew the
other. Perhaps that should be kept
in mind as future editions of this
column appear, for its purpose
will be to cull -from Pitt life the
situations that breed arguments
and discontent and examinethem
for what they are worth.

You culdn’t get a seat in the stu-
dent section of the stadium last
Saturday. Will the proper persons
make good their promise to pro-
vide more seats as soon as suffi-
cient student ‘turnout is evidenced?
If not, this column would he an
excellent place to remind them.

That air which resembles tear
gas in the Tuck Shop. Is it caus-

ed truly by a lack of funds, or a‘
lack of energy on the part of cer-
tain people?.If we are too broke.

to get a decent air conditioning

system for the Tuck Shops, we

might suggest a couple of those

.king size fans that cool the local
tpubs.

Perhaps we can ﬁnd out
why the seldom used fourth
ﬂoor. was plastered instead of
the tomb-like ground ﬂoor.
Maybe we had to use a union
plasterer who has a fear of
the ground ﬂoor crowds, and
prefers the upper stories. You
see, there ‘might be a logical
reason.

There is a lot to be said for
fraternities. and a lot to be said
against them—_perhaps our new

freshmen would like to hear the

side they won’t hear .at those rush-
ing parties.
Even our ﬂawless Pitt News

ihas been chosen

might come in for its share of
lambasting if it ever falls be-
low its present impeccable stand-
ards. »

University policy is a fair sub-
ject for debate if you use a lit-
tle diplomacy. Student govern-
ment associations sometimes bog
down slowly unless presented with
food for thought, and post-war
Pitt has more than a few prob-
lems that need eﬂicient leadership
for solution. Maybe you think our
dances are no good. If so give us
your solution, and we’ll see why
that wasn’t done in the first
place. “

Of course, it’s stupid to
moan about some things. Take
the poor elevator service. The
cars go up and down so fast
the operators complain it’s like
living in a. pile driver. The
elevator dispatcher is hospi-
talized. about once a week
after being trampled by the
12:30 crowd. Also, it’s point-
less to complain about the
Tuck Shop SERVICE. When
the horde of students descend,
the girls are busier than squir-
rels trying to bury nuts on a
tin roof. ‘However, suggesting
that they install a simple thing
like a coke dispenser might
conceivably come under the
heading of constructive criti-
cism.

So—this will initiate the sound

and fury of a host of opinions and
_.ideas about ole Uni and its var-‘
ious

organ.iza‘tion.s.. Suggestions
will be accepted graciously—even
gratefully. Since "few are expect-
ed however, next’ week’s subject

ties, Pro and Con.”

Mr. Gaeth described the drama
of the moment when he first
learned of Hermann Goering’s
suicide.

“Because of the suicide.”vhe/
“the remaining ten con- H

said,
demned men were shackled in
theircells. The American authori-
ties took pains to explain to these
men that the shackling should
carry no stigma of dishonor.”

Goering died, Mr. Gaeth visited
him in his cell and

“Goering was the only one of
the doomed men who did not pace
in his cell,” .Gaeth concluded.
“That was prophetic.”

State Harries Shar
Panther Win Streak

Any hopes that the Pitt cross-country squad might have
entertained concerning an undefeated season were erased at

 

State College last Saturday afternoon. A veteran Penn State
thinelacl squad tripped up the Panther youngsters by a 18-37

count.

Both teams had been unbeaten until this meet but the

Blue and Gold runners, who were9

primed for the hilly terrain of
Schenley Park, were not match for
the Lions over their long straight-
away course.

The Nittany‘ Lions went with-
out the services of their ace, Ger-
ald Karver, of‘ Boyerstown but
teammate Curt Stone of Brooklyn,
Pa. took the cue and broke the
tape for State.

Ollioans Run Wild

Over Northwestern

Ohio State’s_ Buckeyes made it
known that they are due more
than just a passxng interest in the
present Western conrerence stand-
ings as they overturned a hither-
to undefeated Northwestern eleven
last Saturday afternoon.

The Bucks unleashed a vigor-
ous offensive to blast the Wildcats
from their high perch, 39-27, in
one of the wildest scoring sprees
of modern Western Conference
history.

Jerry Krall and Joe Whisler
each accounted for two Ohio
touchdowns with Brown Brugge
and Pete Perini having one apiece.

Pitt Eleven Test
Experienced Buckeyes

by John Golightly -

A Ohio State squad which is long on experience but sho
on victories will eagerly throw out the welcome mat to th
Blue and Gold this Saturday at Columbus.

New items on the Ohio State eleven this year are two fresh-.
men, Guard Bob Gaudio and Quarterback George Spencer, and,‘
a dazzling set of new scarlet and gray uniforms. * ‘I

  
    
        
   
    
  

    

    

The strongarmed Indiana
quarterback set—up two of the
three Hoosier touchdowns and
completed 10 out of 18 heaves for
135 yards in pulling his team a
20-6 victory.

The Pitt eleven scored ﬁrst in
the ﬁrst quarter when a DePas-
qua to McPeak pass covered 26
yards into the end zone. Cecconi’s
try for extra point went wide.

The hometown team didn’t tar-
ry long before they bounced over
the Panther goal with Pete Pihos
carrying the mail from the two.

Mel Groome’s buck over the goal
line from the four in the second
canto and the Cowan chalkline
canter over the goal from the;
Hoosier. 36 in the third frame, was
strictly anti-climax.

Afterthoughts

In certain respects the tilt with
Indiana was on an even basis.
For instance, ‘oth clubs had
eleven first downs and the Pan-
thers outrushed Indiana 111 to
103. However the old adage still
holds that “football still pays oﬁ
in touchdowns.”

Despite the fact that the B0
McMillan squad was a heavy pre-
game favorite and then led the
visitors most of the way, the
Hoosiers used only a few more
subs than did Wes Fesler.
