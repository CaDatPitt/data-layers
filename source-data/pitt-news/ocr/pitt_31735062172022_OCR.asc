McCloskey lats War

by SUE HOENSTINE

Republican Congressman Paul
 l“Pete") McCloskey Monday
urged Carlow College students
opposed to the War. to con-
tact their congressmen and
express that opposition.

The 43-year old Californian
laid part of the blame for the
Wars perpetuation on "lack of
continuity" by voters. He cited
the difference in the number of
War protestors who turn up in
May as compared to the lack
of voters in November.

"There‘s a difference between
beating your breasts over a prob-
lem and taking action to solve
it,“ he said. “We have a medi-
ocre government in Washington
because of the apathetic citizdn-
ry at home."

“We have the opportunity to
end this war during the next 60
days if only people would tell
their congressmen how to vote,”
he added.

McCloskey described his dis-
enchantment with the War that
has led him to say he may
challenge President Nixon for
the Republican presidential
nomination in 1972.

"I don‘t think that our initial
motives for getting involved in
Vietnam were necessarily ques-
tionable. It was the escalation
in ‘65 that I really challenged."
he said.

McCloskey accused Nixon of
willfully deceiving Congress
and lambasted those who sup-
port the War for economic
reasons.

“I have lost faith that our

government is being truthful
with us,” he stated. “If this

country can adopt the View that
in order to keep the economy
going and people employed we

have togfight a war, then we’re
in troub”l‘ié.??’

A 10-minute question and an-
swer session followed McClos-
key's speech. When one coed

srggestedi that the South Viet-
namese may need U. S. support
in the conflict. McC1oskey re-
plied. "I think that the United
States has lost the ability to tell
foreign nations what to do.“

Shapp Proposes Budget

State Senate Okays
$18 Million Subsidy

After being delayed for al-
most six months. the University
of Pittsburgh may receive its

’ $18.9 million subsidy. The State

Senate by a unaminous vote.
promised to pay the bill in two
future installments.

Governor Milton J. Shapp also
recommended to the Legislature
a 43.2 million appropriation to
Pitt for the coming fiscal year.

The amount is $6.6 million
short of what the University
requested; however. it is $5.3
million more than allocations
received last year.

The recent increase in state
spending has been attributed to
the 18 month, 1.5 million dol-
lar tax increase proposed by
Governor Shapp. This measure
also includes the 3.5 per cent
personal income tax. These
measures have been reported

Primary Features Council Races

The polls will be open in Alle-
gheny County from 7 am. until 8
p.m. Tuesday for primary elec-
tions.

And although this election will
determine party candidates. in
some races it could be more de-
cisive than the November gen-
eral elections. T

According to Jane Thompson.
director of the Citizenship Infor-
mation Center (CIC). “this is the
time that your vote could really
count.“

Ms. Thompson pointed out that
the Democratic race for City
Council could be particularly ex-
citing. “Since there have been no
Republicans in City Council since
1953, it is likely -that Democrats

elected in the primary will be
elected in thd general election,”
she said.

Urging voters and especially
students who recently registered
to Vote. Ms. Thompson said. "In
the 1967 primary only 55 per cent
of. all registered voters in Alle-
gheny County voted. The primary
really does make a difference.“

Ms. Thompson also reminds stu-
dents that they must vote in the
district where they are register-
ed. "Even if you registered at Pitt
you are registered at your home
addressgand you must go there to
vote." She added that students
could contact the CIC to verify
the polling-place where they are
registered.

a»Five amendments to the State
Constitution will also appear on

-Tuesday’s ballot. Copies of the

amendments as they will be
worded can be picked up at the
CIC on the 12th floor of the Ca-
thedral. I

A complete lise of primary can-
didiates is also available at the
Center.

Sprung! (At Last)

The long overdue appearance
of spring was greeted by the

seasonal songs of softball,
canines, canine lovers, and
lovers.

Six Republicans and 35 Demo-
crats will vie for the City Council

‘nominations to their respective

parties. Seven Republicans and 13
Democrats are running for Coun-
ty Commissioner slots.

Five‘Democrats will battle for
the Democratic nomination in
the District Attorney contest, with
only one Republican incumbent
Robert Duggan, on the ballot.
Eighteen candidates for Common
Pleas Court will appear on the
ballot.

Row offices contested in the
primary are Clerk of Courts. City
Controller. County Controller.
Pronothonotary.

to be responsible for bringing
the state out of bankruptcy.

Some debts cleared by the

Senate were $25000 to Buhl
Planetarium and $24,000 to
Carnegie Museum. The bulk -

of the remainder went to’ pri-
vate medical schools‘ in Phila-
delphia.

Shapp also recommended an
$81.2 ‘million appropriation to
Pennsylvania State University,‘
an increase of $12 million. and
$47.7 million to
increase of $6.3 million.

The expenditures came out
of Shapp’s total proposed bud-
get of $5.7 billion, the largest
of its kind on Pennsylvania’s
record.

Included in the was

plan

$3.3 billion for the states role‘

in education. welfare. health.
environment. community ser-
vice. justice. and other services.

Special services. such as col-
lege tuition subsidies and fees
for patient care at mental hos-
pitals will receive $345 mi},
lion under the Governor's plan.

Shapp said he was relatively

satisfied with the budget. “Great
progress has been made and this
progress is reflected in the bud-
get,” he stated. '

Also asked for by Shapp is a

$24 million increase in state aid

to mass transit. A plan devised.
by Shapp and the Legislature
could possibly channel a large
portion of the sum to Allegheny

duction." He said Americans
have given little thought to the
technology of prevention. He
further remarked that it is the
public who must take action.

"The citizen who is the source

of pollution also has to be the
source of the solution." he
said. ’ ‘

Duggan also expressed con-
cern over- the problem, and
stressed that if ire-elected, he
would “pursue polluters with as
much vigor as that used against
drug violators and pornography.”

"F-ROM‘_ LEFT“ to ‘right are (seated) Commissioner hopeful Joseph Cosetti, DA_ Candidate John Hickton,
-DA‘ Candidate John Bingler, Commissioner candidate Donald Skillin, and (standing) Thomas Foerster.

Sapp stated that he was not
completely satisfied that existing

laws had been written with the

corporation in mind: “To have

real teeth in the law a corpor-
ation should not be considered:

its the people managing the

corporation. If they knew that

they faced a loss of income or
incarceration they may
more closely to the law."

"I don't give a damn about
industrial entities.“ said Hickton
"I am concerned about the
lives of the people." Hickton
demanded a stronger law. under
which third and fourth offenders
would incur penalties much

‘stiffer than those imposed by

the existing law. He would also
enlarge, the present pollution
monitor system. implementing
county police and detectives.

Cosetti feels that there has

been no substantial change in

in developing an awareness and
understanding of the ‘women’s
movement, prepare faculty to
develop academic programs re-
lating to women, and help- ad-
ministrators identify areas of

ties, innovate changes in their
institutions, and create programs

‘of affirmative action in compli-

ance with federal law.

termed the "rhetoric of the Com-
missioners". He commented that
in fact "the very means we ve
suggested as controls guarantee
us pollution." In regard to
waste disposal. Cosetti stated
that he has studied County pro-
posals for waste disposal and
the ‘final means have not yet
been decided upon.

“According to Foerster," there
have been at least four long
range solutions for waste dispos-
al proposed by private firms.
He stressed, however, with such

an agreement a promise would
have to be made guaranteeing
the firms at certainpamount of
material for recycling. Foerster
remarked that at present this
is not feasible.

Gaitens said he felt "comfor-
table." calling himself the “only
candidate who has committed
himself to c.ope with the prob-
lems. «the environmental prob-
lems that face us today."

Skillin was the only candi-
date who commented at any
length regarding noise pollution.

“I feel we should have muni-
cipal. county. state. and even
federal legislation ' controlling

the noise level of motorcycles.
sports cars, construction air-
‘hammers and compressors. die-
sel trucks and buses. and other
machines that have practically
no control at present on the
decibels to which they subject
the general public." he stated.

Bella Abzug. Democratic
Congresswoman from the 19th
district in New York City. came
to Pittsburgh Monday with sev-
eral of her colleagues as a part
of a nationwide '-'barnstorming"
tour to mobilize support for
legislative anti-war action.

"We in the Congress." said
Abzub. "have discovered that
the country wants to end the
War by the end of the year."
Barnstorming the country. she
stated. may possibly incite "a
popular impetus against the
war. and turn the impetus to-
ward a massive letter-writing
campaign.

“Several congressmen and
women are‘ working toward a’
new approach to politics to try
to restore democracy in this
country." Abzug declared. "In

lation has been losing by just a
few votes.“ Abzug cited the
vote to end the draft
year as an example.

The congresswoman empha-
sized that_ if opponents of the
War exert pressure upon Con-
gress, particularly through let-
ter writing,
July 1, effective results to
terminate the war can be assur-
ed. “All of “the anti-SST mail
made a difference,” she de-
clared,’ “and this mail can be
a great help.” ‘

Abzug expressed strong sup-
port for women. workers. a-nd
young pressuring the govern-
ment. "Women must unite in
political pressure against the
War and in a coalition to run
for political office.“ she said.
"Women have the potential
arena to throw out any incom-
petentpoliticians.“ A

The passage of the abortion
bill in New York occurred only
continuous lobby-
ing. said Abzug. and because
;‘the politicians feared the pow-
er of the women‘s vote.“

When ‘asked whether
considered the recent
demonstrations in Washington
counterproductive, Abzug re-
plied, “No.. These people were
responding to the fact that
Congress has failed to act."
She asserted that Mayday par-
ticipants were brutally beaten
and unlawfully arrested.

Abzug maintained that the
acts of civil disobedience in
Washington were "very much in
the American tradition. as ex-
pressed by Thoreau-and Martin
Luther King.“ A

“The Mayday protest." she
added. "was a protest that
should have been respected. It
is part and parcel of the agony.
frustration. and desperation that
young and old feel in this coun-
try." ' » '

She sported a red polka-dot dress and agflowery hat. But the
New York Congresswoman spoke soberly. "We ve discovered that the
country wants’ to end the war by the end of this year. Bella

I Abzugdeclared.
According to a recent poll. she continued. 73 percent of the r

American people favor a complete U. S. withdrawal f'rom Vietnam
by December. —

Conspicuous in a Roman collar. Robert Drinan. the Jesuit
Congressman from Boston. added that. according to another poll.
two-thirds of all Americans consider it immoral for the U. S. to
stay in Vietnam. _

Why. then. does the war continue. if ours is a democratic so-
ciety?

Richard Nixon is convinced that world peace depends on the

survival of the Thieu-Ky regime in South Vietnam. He fears that a

Communist victory in Vietnam would whet. the appetite of scheming
aggressors.

But Richard Nixon is merely the President.

Congress can. if it cares to. end the involvement of American
troops in Indochina by the end of the year. During the next 60 days.
Congress will considerlegislation to do precisely that.

The House will consider the Vietnam Disengagement and the
Senate will vote on the McGovern-Hatfield amendment to end the
war. ~ ’ ‘

On Monday. eight congressmen appealed to Pittsburghers to
help stop the war. “Each citizen should make a point of writing to
his Congressman and Senators to ask the war‘s end." Congressman
Don Riegle (R-Mich.) pleaded. ’

Next year. all House seats and one-third of the Senate's seats
will be up_ for grabs. If the American people apply enough pressure
on their representatives. they can end the war by threatening to
vote out of office those who vote to stay in Vietnam.

Grassroots opposition to the war is evident, but a resounding
public outcry is not likely.

 

       

I Hedonism, Skepticism Plague Dove Dreams 

Congressman Paul McCloskey (RV-Calif.) doesn’t blame this
paradox. on the American system. Historians.‘~he predicts. will at-
tribute Americas stubborn involvement in Vietnam to a failure of
Congressional leadership.

Perhaps the system is not at fault. But citizens‘ idischantment
with the system is ultimately the reason for our staying in Vietnam.
Americans don't have enough confidence in the «system to “light a
fire" under their representatives. The town meeting spirit of
colonial America has not endured. ' ’

Perhaps the individualistic strain in our culture has gotten out
of hand. It is an ethic that leads easily to personal hedonism and
communal despair. '

We all know that a collective push can end the war. But.
as individuals. we balk because there‘s so little each can do. ‘

"We have a mediocre government in Washington because we.

have an apathetic citizenr_y at home." Congressman McCloskey
claims. Apathy suggests a lack of concern. Americans are concern-
ed but paralyzed. They don't know what to do.

The anti-war Congressmen are telling Americans what to do-
write! ’

The congressmen who came to Pittsburgh made a valiant effort
to instill in the populace a spirit of participatory democracy. They
chose to hope‘ that cries for decentralization and power to the
people are not specious.

I am not hopeful. though.

Thepeople have the power to end the war. It is built into our
system. But I doubt that they will end it, because they are too sel-
fish or skeptical to take action.‘

The appearance of congressmen in Pittsburgh with tips on how
to circumvent the establishment was heartening. But the eight came
on a fool's errand.

Americans are more likely to beat their breasts and march than
pressure Congress to end thewar through the tedious but produc-
tive route of letter-writing.

. lAt‘a time when everyone talks about
: _the “financial crisis" of the universities.
no one seems to discuss the quality of
the services they offer.

It is time we began thinking realis-
 tically. We should not simply find ways
‘of saving universities. Instead we
should first find out what is worth say-
ing. - ‘
Institutions of higher education
ishould be investigated to see how. if at
 all, they serve the interests of the
;state’s citizens. For example, the needs

for community colleges, adult educa-
gtion, and technical training for the
_ unemployed in many respects‘ go beyond
._ p the needs of large universities.

ority to ourselves as educational con-
sumers rather than the institutions which
sell education.

Our most immediate concern now is
the financing of our college careers. In
a the past the costs of our education had
9‘ been paid by scholarships. state subsi-
dies," loans. and tuition fees.

 

In general. we should first give pri-'

t, ’ geseni .5 yrockstina -casts

 

have been covered more and more by
increased tuitions. For example. at Pitt

"there have been ‘three tuition increases

over the past three years. This approach

has kept the universities barely solvent.

But here, as Chancellor Posvar noted
last spring, increased tuitions have also
undercut Pitt's ability” . . , to educate
larger numbers of more able studenta
from lower income families.” But it is
obvious, too, especially after the state’s
financial crisis last year. that Pennsyl-
vania can no longer afford, to continu-
ally write blank checks for higher edu-
cation.

YALE PLAN

The solution to this dilemma might

come from applying a limited ,"Yale
plan" to,the financial problems of needy
students in state and state-related uni-
versities. The plan would have the state
Supply loans to students from lower in-
come families. r

These loans added to the present
state subsidy levels world supply all of
the extra money necessary to cover any
increases intuition. Students woulp pay
back the loans after they graduate on a
long—term basis.

Payment and the rate of interest
would be based on" the ability to pay.
The money collected from this loan
plan could be reinvested into the next
freshman class of all the universities in-
volved.

 
 
 

The goal of those who manage the
plan would be to make the project self-
sufficient by investing in Pennsylvanias
future. its students. - .-

/

The possibilities of such a project
are obvious. First, the plan could be ex-
tended to cover all undergraduates inde-
pendent of need. In time, the costs of
education could be paid simply by tui-
tions and loans.

The loan plan could be extended to
include coverage for graduate students.
There could be provisions to give finan-
cial incentives to those with graduate
degrees to remain in the state after
their graduation.

For example. medical students could
be given incentives by var_ying the rate
of interest of the loans for each year of
residency and practice they have in the
state. _ - ,

Finally. the plan could include pri-
vate universities and small colleges like
Duquesne to help cover the costs of
their students‘ education. But the real
advantage of the loan plan or "Yale
plan" is that it puts a fair responsibility
on a student to pay for his own educa-
tion based on his ability to earn a living
from his degree.

UNIVERSITY QUALITY
The question of financing is a short-

- run escape from the real problem, how-
..ever. That problem is the quality of

   
 

management and performance- of uni-
versities. '

Financing gimmicks don‘t solve the
problems of costs. they subsidize them.
The legislature and governor could aid
the management of universities by simp-
ly making their educational plans more
rationally.

For example the state should estab-
lish. with expert .advice. educational
goals which will benefit all Pennsyl-
vania citizens. Instead of randomly ful-
filling the demands of begging colleges
and universities. it should help coor-
dinate the activities of these institutions
through the states appropriation poli-
cies.

With this approach, the legislature
should approve a general capital bud-
get for all state and state-related uni-
versities. In this way it could help in-
itiate building activities which benefit
the educational consumer, rather than
the megalomania of some of the pyra-
mid-builders. that exist in every’ uni-
versity hierarchy.

An example is Pitts dorm expansion.

Its apparent to many. people that the

density of students in Oakland has
reached the saturation point.

’ reasonable when one realizes the present
lack of recreational facilities. and space

As a matter of fact. the Commissioners should

State Universities Need Improvement

for dorm students. which has al-
ready partially caused the des-
truction of the lawns by touch
football players around the Ca-
thedral.

The proposition becomes even
more obivious when we realize the
problems of traffic congestion, se-
curity, and community antagon-
isms.

But Pitt. ignoring these facts.
made its own plans arbitrarily to
build new dorms and has recon-
sidered somewhat now. only after
the community rebelled. This ex-
ample hopefully demonstrates
why there should be more central
planning for capital spending to
find out what is really needed and
for whom.

Finally. it the legislature really
supports educational goals for the
consumer rather than for the ben-
efit of institutions. it should make
its educational planning more
equitable. Presently. Penn State
students pay less for their educa-
tion than Pitt or Temple students.

Penn State's main campusat L'ni-

this situation is politics. This in-
equity must be remedied by equal-
izing the tuitions at the three
schools.

According to Vice Chancellor
Edison Montgomery, if Penn State
raised its tuitions to Pitt’s level.
and the money saved being redis-

universities should be made on a
formula basis. This formula would
consider the number and type of
students at a university. Plus it
would consider the services and
research offered by the university.

But whatever we do. we should
attempt to take the politics out of
educational planning. In other
words. the educational consumer
should be put first.

tributed to Pitt and Temple, it
would help prevent further tuition
increases at Pitt.

“Brazen” SA Roasted

Editor:

The attitude of the student government people toward financial
responsibility almost literally begs the students to distrust those who
now control the Student Association.

It's as if a person, whenhe paid this income tax. didn’t
bother to fill out any forms, decided for himself how much he
should pay, and brushed aside the inquiries of the Department of
Internal Revenue with the statement that they would just have to
trust his personal honesty!

Or as if a bank said to the Federal Reserve Board: "Don‘t

bother to audit our books. Just trust our integrity. Our honesty’

makes any check unnecessary. And if theres any financial infor-
mation we think you should have. well let you know!"

The student government people want to be able to spend the
students‘ money in any manner they choose without giving the
students reasonable guarantees that their money is being spent
properly.

When we the students paid our activities fee. we didn't do so
with the intention of handing our money over to become in effect
the personal property of the student government people. It is still
our money. and we ‘have the right to expect that. when it is spent.
we can be reasonably sure that it is being spent in a manner that
displays some measure of real integrity on the part of those who
do the spending.

The promise to make public “all pertinent information” regard-
ing the spending of the students’ money is a specious. . . guarantee
of honesty. We the students would have to rely on the student gov-
ernment people to decide for us what information is not pertinent
and therefor unfit for our eyes.

And we would have to trust the student government people to
make public information that is true and accurate. It would be ex-
tremely easy for them to clarify information about their spending.
but we would have to trust them not to do such a naughty thing.

The recent move by the student government people was not a
display of boldness. But of unbridled gall! Of uncommon chutzpah!

They are conducting themselves in a style reminiscent of the
most brazen days of Boss Tweed and his gang. For people who
claim a mandate from the students. they display a cavalier disre-
gard for student opinion and also an obvious distrust of it.

They could have announced their pecuniary plans in March or
early April when the great mass of students were available to ex-
press their reactions. They could have waited until September when
the great mass of students will return.

But instead they chose a time when few students would be
able to respond. Could it be those student government people re-
alize that the students. whose opinions they claim to advance. are
in actuality very likely to oppose what they are trying to pull ot'l"."."?

The fact that the commissioners were put in office by the stu-
dents. by only a small sliver of the students as it turned out. does
not give them the right to claim freedom from the responsibility to
faithfully execute their offices.‘ nor any right to claim unlimited
power to do whatever they want to do.

Like Robespierre during the French Revolution, the student
government people want to exercise what would be in effect unre-
strained authority simply because they assert they are the spokes-
men of the will of the people. -

But upon examination it is seen that the people they really rep-

resent are not the students. but merely themselves. Joseph Forbes

It is hoped that the Pennsyl-

near future, just as it is hoped
that Pitt's Invitational will. As
Banner will “give it a try,” in
the meet, he hopes other coaches

Banner is still delighted over
the success of the invitational.

Banner announced that Rich

Commenting on the big com-
petition of the meet, Banner
thinks that Jim Ryan will beat
Marty LaQuiro this weekend.

"Jim Ryan. Jim Ryan all the
way. predicts the track coach.
"I think .Jim‘s the finest runner
anyone's ever seen. He’ made a
tactical error in the last Olym-

ner should. I could be wrong.

“Terry had to throw off bal-

a hard play, one which he usually
makes pretty well. You can’t fault
him——I’ve seen many shortstops
do the same under similar plays.”

It was a tough loss for Sylanski
who struck out eight Clarion bat-
ters and allowed only five hits.

“Albie pitched good." stated
Lewis. “but he was under terrific
pressure out there with no runs

The Pitt golfers conclude
their season this week and are

their best record in years.

"Navy is a tough team. They
beat us last year and should do
good again this year.” related
Coach Peer_v. a little worried

but still full of his usual opti-
mism. '

However, the Pitt Linksmen
won’t be a patsy for the Mid-
shipmen. As Peery stated, “Our
boys have been improving all
season long. We have some real-
ly good looking boys.”

The Pitt golfers appear to be
better than just good looking.
considering three of them shot
80 at the E.I.G.A. and the lead-
ing score was 74.

The linksmen also traveled to
Indiana. Pa. this week to com-

ing before it spun off the track

40th lap. the Pitt car had ad-
vanced to fifth spot.

off the track. it was unable to
return to finish the race. '

opposing pitchers for six home
runs and has driven in a total
of 21‘runs.

Macha. who ended last sea-
son with a .265 average. didn't
expect to be hitting as well as
he has been this year.

“I struck out a lot last year,"
stated Macha. “I’ve been able
to cut that out. I now have more
pitches to hit at and ‘I’ve had
luck in hitting the ball better.

“A couple of those home runs
were lucky." said Macha. "It
would be nice if every time I
walked up to the plate I got a
home run. But I just try to hit
the ball-—-I don't swing every
time to hit the ball over the
fence." ‘ .

"Ken has always been a good
hitter." commented Panther
coach Bob Lewis. "I think hes
done so well this season because
he has such great confidence.
Hes just meeting the ball—not
trying to kill it—and that's, why
hes hitting for both average
and distance.“

Macha has been playing base-
ball since he was eight years old
and in that time has played al-
most every position.

"Ive played almost ever_v-
where.“ said Macha. "It's not
because I‘m good everywhere.
it‘s just that I‘ve been able to
play in many positions."

Last year Macha was I the
Panther leftfielder.‘ but this
year he has been seeing a lot
of action at first base.

“Of all the positions I've play-
ed 1 like first base best," he
related. “You’ve got to be

~ awake all the time. But all you

have to do then is catch the
ball—it’s not that demanding on
aperson.” .

Machas expectations for the

team has not been met in the
Panthers present 11-5 season

record.

SALE ON KLH

Model 11w. is now $179.95
Model 26 is now $229.95

During the recent (and ﬁrst) KLH sale many people were disappointed that it did not
include the outstanding models 11W and 26. Well theirwish has been answered with
savings of $30 and $40. These famous compact stereo systems are complete with speakers,
ampliﬁers, and phonographs, but no FM or ARI. They were designed for people who
are interested in playing records and not the radio. Yet I'M or tape can be added later
if you change your mind. The 11-w is the non-portable, but equally compact, walnut Ver-
sion of the famous model 11, which (if you remember your Klillistory) was the world’s
ﬁrst high performance portable stereo phonograph. The model 26 is sort of a big brother
to the 11-W. Its ampliﬁer has double the power, its speakers are larger, and (if
possible) it sounds even better, particularly in a large room that you want to ﬁll
with concert level sound. Either stereo system makes the perfect QUALITY gift for
the graduate. Your personal KLH system will be completely checked out and adjusted
by the sail’ and service dept. of opus one. Sale ends June 15th. Bank-Americard, Master
