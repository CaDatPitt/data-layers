In the next few years, Pitt neuroscientists
hope to discover key features of the nervous
system that might rival the accomplish-

A ‘ ments of past Pitt medical researchers such

asjonas Salk, designer of the polio vaccine.

The University announced in a state— *

ment Monday that it plans to create a Brain
Institute that “aims to unlock the mysteries
of normal and abnormal brain ﬁmction.”
Peter Strick, neurobiology chairwho re-

searches movement and cognition,,will
' ‘head the institute. ‘

Alan Sved, chair of the neuroscience
department, said the institute aims‘ to
advance Pitt’s status and research in the
neuroscience ﬁeld. V

“One of the goals of the institute is to
enhance the resources and visibility of
Pitt neuroscience,” Sved said. “Our goal is
to move the ﬁeld forward with the goal of
treating neuraland psychiatric issues and

problems.” I
The institute will comprise ﬁve different

centers that each focus on a different topic, if

including treatment technology, neurode-
generative disorders, neurodevelopment

- and the mapping of circuitry and activity,

‘according to .a statement. The NeuroDis—
covery Center, the ﬁfth center, will support
innovative and interdisciplinary research,
which could be less likelyto receive funding

‘ from grants.

Strick discussed the hope for the op-
portunitiesof discovery and innovation
through the Neur6Discovery.center.

“I see myjob asgfacilitating the science
of others,” Strickvsaid.--“The Brain Insti-
tute is really about that and creating the
opportunity for discovery. We have to cre-

ate the opportunity for people to make the _ -

discovery.” _ _ ‘ .
Strick added that the Brain Institute’s
placement within an academic setting will
be an additional beneﬁt.
“To encompass all that the brain does,

it takes a university,” Strick said. “And I
think this is a very special place where we
can do that.”A

Both basic research‘, such as the study of

the ﬁmctionality of different neuron popu- .
lations, and translational research, such as -

the study of psychiatric diseases, will take
place at the Brain Institute. ‘
Linda Rinaman, a Pitt neuroscience
professor who studies the effects of stress
on neural pathways and behavior, said that
while the institutefwill focus on research
rather than undergraduate education, un-
dergraduate students will reap  She

.. has hopes that resources will be alltlcated

to fund undergraduate research felliiwships
that might culminate in full—time iminersive

research during summers. .

“Based on what has been communicate
publicly, I’m optimistic that the new Brain
Institute will increase the availability of
laboratory research experiences for under-
graduate and graduate students, as new fac-
ulty are hired and new research initiatives

are realized,” Rinaman said in an email.
~ She added that support of “high-risk,
potentially high-payoff” projects at Pitt will
hopefully encourage other institutions to
do the same. She said the neuroscience ﬁeld
is “extremely broad and multidisciplinary,”
and collaborative projects between multiple
laboratories achieve success more quickly.
“A stated goal of the Brain Institute is to
provide the infrastructure to bring neuro-
scientists together to work on big ideas, to
encourage those scientists to be creative
and ambitious,” she said.‘
Sved, who researches nicotine’s effects
on neurobiology and the neural control of

cardiovascular-ﬁinction, said the institute’s ‘
’ attractiveness to neuroscientists could sub-

sequently beneﬁt students. A

Websites, social media help students find roommates, housing

Kathleen Fennell
Staﬁ" Writer

As print classiﬁed ads in newspapers be-
come increasingly obsolete, students can
scroll online to ﬁnd a new pad on Pitt’s
‘campus.

While many turn to social networks

’ such as Facebook and Twitter, others use

Craigslist to ﬁnd housing or roommates.
And one group of students is utilizing Twit-
ter and WordPress to consolidate housing
listings for other students.

Kristy Chen, a junior majoring in eco-

nomics, is one member of a six-person V

team known as “Nomad Nation” that cre-
ated CampusNoobs.com, a website that
aims to hook students up with off-campus
housing options at Pitt. The ﬁve other stu-

_dents who operate the website declined to

give their names and prefer to be known

as .“the Nomad Nation.”

The students launched the website in ‘

December, and since then, it’s linked sev-
eral students with a roommate or housing

’ option and gained more than 100 followers

on its Twitter page. ,

Chen said the students are currently
compiling listings to establish a one-stop
shop for off-campus options. The website
is currently undergoing trial run to see
how students use it, she said, so the team
can tailor the site to students’ needs.

The website provides listings of avail-
able rentals and sublets off— campus at Pitt,
as well as student posts seeking housing.
Campus Noobs’ Twitter provides live up-
dates of the -newest listings. Chen said
the creators also plan to add a feature for
students to create renter reviews for each
listing to encourage transparency among
landlords.

“This forces lan_dlords to .be more
responsible because it creates natural
competition, whereas normally whoever
got their word out the most had the most
audience. It’s safer for students and a bet-
ter option,” she said.

On the site, the creators operate under
the name “The Nomad.” Chen said the alias
directs the focus to the service, rather than
the students who created it.

“The Nomad represents everyone, ev-
eryone who is looking for something in
life, everyone who is learning, traveling
on a voyage, the journey of life,” she said.
“It’s supposed to be representative of an
idea, of a service that we want to provide
versus a single person or a name.”

Chen said Campus Noobs does not
make any money for the students that
work on it.

“This whole project is focused on pro-

viding the service to the students. We’re
not looking to make any money from it,”
she said. “Maybe in the future, even if we
do, I would think that we would want to

‘use that money for a charitable cause.”

If the site is successful at Pitt, Chen said
the team could expand Campus Noobs to
other campuses.

“If it works at Pitt, we should definitely
do it for other campuses, because I know
[housing issues are] a common problem
that happens for every campus around
here,” she said. “It’s not just us.”

Chen found housing through Pitt’s
off—campus housing website during her
sophomore year.

She said that while social media sites
such as Facebook allow students to dis-
cover potential roommates’ interests,
it’s unlikely they’ll be able to determine a

I’m not the best with socializing.
I bring books to family gather-

I might have ﬂaws when it
comes to social interaction, but
even the most adept communica-

‘triviality of "small talk.

When did it become socially
unacceptable to talk about the

Smalltalk is boring. No one

because everyone is too busy on

We need to start talking about

— things that matter, things we care.

about and thingsfthat affect us on
a personal level. fLet’s, forget about
the person who took our clothes,
out of dryer without bothering

. to fold them and instead talk about

things  mean sornethingito us.
ionesiemester, I took a religious
studies class and was shocked to

. realizeiiiat the professor was not
allowed to ask us_anything about

our personal views on religion
— not even through a class-wide

poll — unless we voluntarily pro— -

vided the information‘. The class
centered on questions such as
whether.God exists and if miracles
are possible, questions on which
everyone in the room had an opin-
ion. Yet we’ were never forced to
confront our ownbeliefs, at least
not publicly. My question is, why
I_ understand that religion is
intensely personal-and that people
geteasily offended by the subject,
but if we talked about it more and
stopped shoving it into a corner,
maybe'we’d create more under-

standing and more acceptance of _

people’s different beliefs.
Same goes for sex. Like reli-
gion, it’s a taboo topic, despite the

fact that it plays an important role '

in our lives. We end up Googling
sex questions and then deleting
our browsing history, all because
it’s easier to ask the Internet if
the correct term is “foreplay” or
“ﬂoor-play” instead of asking a
friend. ‘

I’m not saying I want to hear
the intimate details of your boy-

‘ friend’s visit last weekend, but I do

think that questions starting with,
“Is it normal that ...” shouldn’t be
embarrassing to ask.

I think one reason we avoid
talking about these issues is be-
cause people are easily upset by
them. Say the word “Obamacare”

..to, the. next person you meet,

and you’ll see what Imean. It’s
easier and more convenient to
talk about the polar vortex that

swept through Pittsburgh instead -
of health care, despite the fact
. that one topic has more lasting
consequences forus, because we I

can all agree that last week was
really cold — we can’t all agree

that Obamacare is helpful for ev-

eryone. g _
We shy away from controver-
sial topics, but I think we need to

start embracing them. Yes, people i

are going to disagree. Yes, people
will getoffended. But one of the
best ways to learn opposing beliefs
and to sharpen our own is through
dialogue.‘

And besides, it is so much more‘ .

interesting to talk about things

that.involve a bit of dissension, as .

opposed to the latest Miley Cyrus
scandal? We all know her VMAs
performance was terrible, so
where’s the fun in rehashing that?

So let’s pull out all the stops
and dig deep. Talk about quantum
physics on the ﬂy, Gandhian prin-
ciples while you’re procrastinating
in the Cathedral and that weird
thing your girlfriend did last night
(is that normal? Always?). Don’t
have anything to say? Stay silent.

It didn’t get any better for Pitt. McBride
and the second—ranked Fighting Irish broke
open a huge ﬁrst-half lead with extremely
efficient offense, shooting 61 percent from
the ﬁeld en. route to a 109-66 win Thursday
night at the Petersen Events Center.

After knotting the score ‘at six in the early
stages of play, Pitt (9-9, 1-3 ACC) surren-
dered 12 straight points and never stood a

realistic chance at climbing back into the

game against the Fighting Irish. _
Notre Dame (16-0, 4-0 ACC) shot 40-for-‘66

‘ fromthe ﬁeld, mostly a product of the 46

points they scored in the paint.
“We felt we had to play great to compete
with them,’_’ Pitt head coach Suzie McCon-

A nell-Serio said. “We are just not there yet.”

Junior guard Brianna Kiesel did all she could

for Pitt, scoring 20 points in.28 minutes of .
play. The bigger issue than the loss, though, .

may be the health of Kiesel, who left the

game with 12 minutes left after banging her '

knee on the ﬂoor. McConnell-Serio had no
update on her status after the game. Mar-
quel Davis also reached double ﬁgures for
the Panthers, scoring 10 points. ‘
Despite scoring a team-high 20 points, Kie-
sel was visibly frustrated at her total during
the game as sophomore guardjewell Loyd
and freshman Lindsey Allen teamed up to

\

limit Kiesel’s effectiveness as much as they

possibly could.

“[Kiesel] is a special player,” McConnell-
Serio said. “They tried to make her earn
everything they got. She is a competitor
who will bring it at both ends of the ﬂoor.
I’mjus1'.‘ hoping we have hervin our next game
because she is a difference maker for us. ”
McBride and Loyd led Notre Dame on the
offensive end, too, posting20 points apiece
as ﬁve Fighting Irish players reached double
ﬁgures in scoring.

fense, with the Irish making basket after

that really opened it up. _

The numbers don’t lie": 61 percent from the,
ﬁeld, 75 percent from beyond the arc, 20-

It was more of the same for the Irish, who
have now scored at least 90 points in 10 of
the 16 games they have played this season.
“We really were trying to go inside, trying
to get off at the start going inside,” Notre
Dame head coach Muffet McGraw said. “It
was a big mismatch. We wanted to go inside,

ﬁrst and allow our forwards to score. We got
some things to open up for us on the perim-
eter after we did that, and it worked well.”
Lloyd said the Irish played a very effective

“We were really patient,”_ Loyd said. “We
stuck to our game plan and really got in
a good groove out there with each other.”
McGraw said even though her team beat up
on Pitt this time, the Panthers program is
clearly trending upwards and will improve

in the future.

“They had a great win against Virginia,’
McGraw said. “Kiesel is one of the best point
guards in the league and she scored 20, even
though we were keying on her. I think now
they have some upperclassmen and Suzie

Pitt men’s basketball hasn’t faced many 2-3

zone defenses this season, but ﬁfth-year for- ’

ward Lamar Patterson said he and his team
know how to exploit one.

“I like the middle,” said Patterson, point-
ing to a foul line in the Petersen Events Cen-
ter’s practice gym. “Right in the middle of the
2-3. That’s where we wantto get the ball. If you
get inthe heart of that zone, then it’s going to
be hard for them to stop it because we’ve got
guys who are aggressive and who can score
and guys who can pass the ball.

“That’s what you want to do against their
zone,” he added.

Patterson will act as the cornerstone of
Pitt’s offensive attack on Saturday when the
No. 22 Panthers (16-1, 4-0) take on No. 2 Syra-
cuse (17-0, 4-0) at the Carrier Dome at4p.m.

Pitt spent this past week’s practices playing
against a 2-3 zone defense — one identical to
the renowned 2-3 zone Syracuse coach Jim
Boeheim has thrown at teams for decades.
Dixon said his team has been practicing

against that scheme, which exhibits the same
tendencies as Syracuse’s.

“I’m going to be all over the court. I’m going
to be wherever the team needs me. Wewant to
get inside there,” said Patterson, againpoint—
ing to the free-throw line. “We ‘don’t want to
settle for outsidejump shots because we know
we can get in there and get better shots.”

The matchupwill be the most meaningful
game for Pitt’s program since the Panthers
collected their 18th win of the 2010-2011
season against Syracuse. Pitt is off to its best
start in league play since that season, when

the team amassed a 7-0 record before losing ‘

a game.

Pitt and Syracuse now sit atop a reformed
ACC with perfect records.

Pitt coach Jamie Dixon has garnered
bragging rights in the biannual rivalry, as
his 10-4 record against Boeheim always at-

tracts the question: What’s the secret to beat-

ing Boeheim and the Orange?

Students ﬁnd creative Ways to keep warm in winter. months

Lindsay Passodelis
Staff Writer

Pitt students resorted to footie pajamas and
space heaters last week when the Pittsburgh
area entered a polar vortex and tempera-
tures dropped below zero. V

The weather, negative wind chills, frozen
pipes and broken heaters, forced students
to ﬁx the issues while trying to stay warm.

Leah DiGiacobbe, a Pitt sophomore ma-
joring in chemistry, found warmth despite
her broken heater and a lack of hot water

in her two—story Centre Avenue apartment. -

On the apartment’s ﬁrst ﬂoor, .tempera-
tures dipped to 30 degrees, according to
DiGiacobbe. ,

Nate Morgan Properties, which owns
DiGiacobbe’s apartment, gave her a space
heater to warm the ﬁrst ﬂoor of her apart-
ment until the heater could be ﬁxed. In ad-
dition to the faulty heater, the hot water
suddenly stopped working, as well.

According to Eric Morgan, a construc-
tion manager for Nate Morgan Properties,
which is a subdivision of A.M.O. Manage-
ment, tenants can take several steps to keep
a house warm and insulated in brutally cold
temperatures.

Morgan suggested residents contact a
plumbing company to hook up a heat-thaw-
ing machine to the pipes to heat up the line.

Among other, more unconventional,

methods, Morgan suggested the use of
electronic appliances.

“You can use a hair dryer on [pipes] to‘

thaw [them] out and then insulate [the pipe]
after you’re done,” Morgan said. “Or put
a space heater in front of [them]4to let it
thaw out.” .
Morgan recommended the prevention of
future incidents by insulating the building
with materials that can be found at hardware

stores, such as ﬁberglass wrap or rubber . , ‘— A

plastic.

Morgan said that Nate Morgan Proper— ' A ‘

ties has had about 11 buildings around the
greater Pittsburgh area with pipe freezes

since the temperature dropped last week. - 

The company is still currently trying to ﬁx
the problems. ’ _ ‘ I I

“We seldom run into pipe freezes here,
so when it drops down to zero with wind
chills like that, it takes a day and you really
ﬁnd out where your problem areas are,”
Morgan said. “Welhaven’t had freezes for
years until last week.’’ ,

As of Jan. 16, Nate Morgan Properties’
affected buildings have been ﬁxed in prob-
lematic areas by accessing the heartof the
pipe freezes, but the rental company still
needs to undergo building repairs, which
will involve the installation of the insula-
tion parts. V

“The shower wasn’t working, but my
roommates were lucky because they could

of a growing trend for Pitt students moving
off campus: Mixed-gender housing. Although
some dormitories at Pitt allow men and women

at Pitt to live inthe same building, and in some
cases even on the same ﬂoor; there are no of-
ﬁcial University housing options inwhich men
and women" are allowed to live in the same
suite or room.

Katelyn Osborn, a nursing student at Mercy
Hospital located Downtown and Ludwig’s fu-
ture housemate, said she thinks the setup will
involve “less drama” for sure, but some minor
inconveniences could arise.

“When you live with grls, you don’t have to
worry about wearing clothes,” Osborn said. “I
think that I’ll still be alittle bit prudish about it.”

In some cases, recruiting an extra room-
mate could result in mixed-gender housing.

Monica Showrank, a junior marketing

major, shares an apartment with four other
women and one man. Their male roommate
ﬁlled the last room in their six-bedroom liv-
ing space.

“Everyone knew him and knew he wasn’t
a shady, character,” Showrank said. “For two
of us, he was already our really good friend.”

Showrank said because other housemates’
busy schedules, they don’t have many prob-
lems, but theifemale housemates are deﬁnitely
cleaner. . '

“I think it’s because girls know how girls
live,” she said. “Ithinkboys, even my dad when
he went to Pitt, lived in the crappiest houses.
He didn’t care how it was as long as he had a
place to sleep.”

Other universities in Pittsburgh similarly ~

offer on- and off-campus livingoptions pairing
men and womenltogether, ,

BrettGreene, aPointParkUniversity senior,
is in his second year as a resident assistant
and has lived on mixed—gender ﬂoors every
year so far. ’ ,  ' '

“Generally, they get along pretty. well,”
Greenesaid. “Usually, it’s just the parents that
want [their daughters] to be on an all-female
ﬂoor.” »

Greene said that while Point Park does ad-
vertise its co—ed housing to students; parents '
occasionally complain about privacy worries.

One of Renninger’s roommates called

“The only thing I could think of was to

service schedules monitor the temperatures
of pipes, which are more closely monitored
during cold spells. '

“We have had pipes burst in all types
of buildings,'including three in residence
halls during last week’s abnormally cold
streak,” Fedele said. “There are contingency
plans that would "be enacted depending on
the severity of the situation, but they could
include temporarily housing students in
other facilities.” ‘

Luckily, none of last week’s issues _re-.

quired student relocation because the prob-
lem areas were contained in the common

areas or mechanical rooms, according to

Fedele.
Rich Navari, the owner of Sembower

. Mikesell Plumbing, said he received hun-

dreds of reports from the freezing tempera-
tures lastweek.

« “Some people didn’t even knowltheir =
‘ lines were frozen, and after it warmed up,

the lines split and people had leaks every-
where,” Navari said. A L
Navari explained that pipes willfreeze

-v when water freezes, at 32 degrees Fahren-

heit. The best way to keep pipes from freez-
ing isto make sure that the water running
through them is continuously moving, as

' water  harder to freeze While it’s in motion.
 if To dothat, the best thing is to leave the
' faucet on a» constant drip, both on the hot

and cold water sides. That way, Navari ex-
plained-, the likelihood of the water freezing
is lower.

According to Navari, another approach
when ﬁnding out that temperatures are go-
ing to drop is to open up doors in the house
and allow heat to get to places where it usu-
ally doesn’t get. N

“If you set your thermostat into energy
saving mode, don’t do that,” Navari added.

.“Instead, raise it up a few degrees to make

the house warmer than what you normally
keep it.” ' A A

' Additionally, older homes have more of
a chance that their pipes will freeze than
newer homes.’

“When [older homes] were built, energy
wasn’t as costly, so insulation standards
may have not been as good,” Navari said.
“And because of that, a plumbing freeze-up
is more likely.”

In mu1ti—level apartments, which many
oﬂ’—campus houses are, a frozen pipe burst-
ing may cause damage to the ﬂoor below.

“The more you do to protect [the pipe],
the more safe it will be,” Navari said. I

Guide promotes amicable interactions, between Oakland neighbors;

Lauren Bauschard
Staﬁ’ W riter ’
Permanent S.outh Oakland resident Liz-
abeth Gray has watched a new crop of
students move into her neighborhood
surrounding Ophelia Street over the past
seven years, and she is noticing a great
improvement in the relationship between
students and long-term residents. Pitt
officials say they believe these improved
relations are a result of new efforts to
bridge gaps between Oakland residents.
_ Pitt’s Office of Community and Gov-
ernmental Relations launched its ﬁrst
edition of the “Student: Guide to Campus
Life” during orientation week of the fall
2013 semester. At its launch,]ohn Wilds,
assistant vice chancellor of community
relations, told The Pitt News that rela-
tionships between students and long-
term residents are always a topic of dis-
cussion.
“Monday mornings I receive phone
calls about student misbehavior and

em Prta am: is 

residents complaining about student
actions,” Wilds said.

Since community groups and the
Student Government Board worked to
distribute 4,000 copies of the guide, the
handbook has aimed to educate students
on various aspects of off-campus living,
such as how to be a good neighbor to
fellow students and permanent residents
of Oakland. ‘ T

Kannu Sahni, director of community
relations, said the Office of Community
and Governmental Relations spearheaded
three “Be a Good Neighbor” components:
neighborhood block parties, the “Student
Guide to Campus Life” and tenants’ rights
workshops. .

Wilds said the Office of Community
and Governmental Relations identiﬁed
three sites in North, South and Central

‘Oakland where they had received the

most complaints about excessive party-

ing or littering to hold block parties.
The office hosted the three block par-

ties last semester on Dithridge Street,

4 Parkview Avenue and Lawn Street.

“We want to ameliorate some of the
issues our neighbors are having with stu-
dents,” Wilds said. '

Both Sahni and Wilds said the block
parties were a success in allowing some
of the long-term neighbors and students
to become better acquainted with one an-
other. Wilds said the residents exchanged
phone numbers so if there was ever a
problem or complaint in the future,’they
would have someone to call.

Pat O’Donnell, 2013 president of Delta
Chi fraternity, attended the block party
on Dithridge Street on Sept. 19, 2013, with

some of his fraternity brothers. O’Donnell _

said the party provided an opportunity
to eat pizza, drink soda and mingle with
neighbors and community leaders.
O’Donnell,‘ a senior industrial engi-
neering major,. said‘ he and his brothers
have greatly beneﬁted from meeting.the
neighbors and building relationships.
“It is often easy for non—university

affiliates to generalize students as wholly

ting

disrespectful or ignorant, but this was a
great opportunity to put a personal face
on the overall student-community rela-
tionships for both parties,”~O’Donnel1
said in an email. ’_ — 0

Wilds said someof the students who
attended thelblock parties even offered
to shovel their neighbors’ driveways in
the winter.

Gray, a freelance writer,- said she

‘noticed a difference in the relationship
between the students and some of the

residents after the block party.

“I have made a point ofgetting to-know '
‘my neighbors,” Gray said. “But I think

other residents are getting a bit more

used to approaching students, as well.”
Gray said she believes the establish-

ment of friendly neighbor relations is

' an ongoing process, but that things are

headed in the right direction.

Bookshelves, kitchen space worth considering in apartment search

John Lavanga
A€9"E .Edz't0r

When on the ‘hunt for an apartment, the
frantic calls to leasing landlords can blind
prospective renters from looking at the
aesthetics of the place at hand. Sure, it may
have a stellar location, but what if you are a
foodie’ and the kitchen is the size of a small
closet? Here areesome things to consider
so you canfﬁnd an apartment that can be
easily decorated and can be tailored to
your needs:

When size doesn’t matter ’

Don’t nix a place just because itis small.
There are ways to accommodate to apart-

ments of all sizes. Consider howa bigger V

apartment might feel empty if you do not
havela lot of furniture or it does not come
furnished. Small apartments afford the
opportunity to de—clutter what you have
accumulated overthe years, showcase your
style without spending exorbitantly and
create a welcoming and cozy environment.

On the opposite end of the spectrum, if

A you-have a large studio apartment, do ‘not

feel regulated by the open, rectangular lay-

 /zz  

\

out of the space. A large bookcase or even

decorative screen can be used to divide the
space into small living areas that help to
create a cozy, more personal environment.
Look for unique for useful architec-
ture ‘ ,
Places with built—in bookshelves are a
steal. Theyhave a timeless aesthetic and

_can hold more than books. Feel free to

stack storage bins on them, make them
your closet space, display your artwork
or simply use th_em for their original pur-
pose ‘— tostore your Organic Chemistry or
Theories of Architecture textbooks. ’

If there is something quirky, such as
a random small room or a kitchen with
no windows, there are ways to work with
it. For small rooms, consider using them
as storage» space or create a small study
area apartfrom your bedroom. Often, your
bedroom is actually the most unproductive

space to do homework, as your body natu~.

rally associates it with resting and sleep.
If you are afoodie (e.g.you have a copi-

ous amount of kale in your refrigerator,

copper pots in your pantry and truffle oil.

Pitt is at war. Civil war. Well, not actually, but
the silently implicated rivalry between North
Oakland and South Oakland has residents

as dedicated to their neighborhood as the,

Romans were to Augustus.

Although the general Pitt culture remains
relatively constant throughout campus and
surrounding neighborhoods, whether you
live north or south of the center of campus
can signiﬁcantly shape the latter end of your
Pitt experience. ,

On Friday nights around dusk, South
and Central Oakland hums with plans brew-
ing for the evening. Between 10 p.m. and 2
a.m., the hum begins to build into a beauti-
ful melody of clicking heels, squeals of long
lost friends who haven’t seen each other in
an aching 10 hours and intoxicated bodies
swaying to the sounds of beer being ponged
and cups being ﬂipped.

The South Oakland sonata falls into a
quiet lull in its composition as Saturday

When it comes to being a good roommate, honesty trumps nicety

John Lavanga
A5:-3"E ,Edz'2f0'r

Nobody is inherently a good roommate.

Sure, there are naturally amiable and
respectful people that you can live with, but
the ability to coexist is an art that needs to
be mastered. A person from the outset can-
not know exactly how to please everyone
they live with, unless of course they move
out but continue to pay rent.

This process of becoming a good room»

mate requires trial—and—error. You have

i to test the reactions of the people you live

with.

Early on I realized that my roommate
did not appreciate when I ate his Korean
leftovers — which, in hindsight, I totally
understand. The next time around, I did
not eathis leftovers, no matter how tempt-
ing it was. .

The key to a good roommate relation-
ship is open—mindedness and the ability to
accept criticism. If you are ableto choose

Honesty is the better substitute to har-
boring animosity. Animosity tends to lead
to passive aggressivelbehavior, and that
type of behavior will cause either you or
one of your roommates to start living full—

_ time at a signiﬁcant other’s apartment, with

only occasional visits that tend to involve
the slamming of doors.

To avoid such a scene, respecting com-
mon areas is a must, because the whole

New SGB members continue push for published OMET   

Danielle Fox
Staff Wrz'ter

‘Do you have the time to take a ﬁve—minute

survey?

What if that survey was the OMET sur-
vey, and your participation granted you
access to every instructor’s results?

The OMET evaluation, which stands for
the Office of Measurement and Evaluation
of Teaching, is often called the “student
opinion of teaching survey.” Students get
the chance at the end of each semester to
complete the online survey and anony-
mously tell some of their professors what
they really think about their classes. The
responses are used to evaluate the fac-
ulty and help professors structure their
classes.

Members of the Student Government
Board have another use in mind for the
surveys and want to take the results from
private opinions to public information.

Former Student Government Board

January 17, 2014 | The Pitt News i wvvvv.pitinevvs.c0m

member Tomjabro and outgoing Academ-
ic Affairs Committee Chairman Nuwan
Perera spearheaded efforts last semester
along with Academic Affairs Committee
members to press the University to grant
students access to the results of Pitt’s Of-
ﬁce of Measurement and Evaluation of
Teaching surveys. SGB started its ﬁght for
the results in 2010 andjabro ran on ﬁnish-
ing the job as one of his three platforms
during his 2012 campaign to be a Board
member. The Board has yet to ﬁnd success
with their push. -
The project won’t end here, however,
and the current Board is set up to pick up
where Jabro, Perera and the committee
left off. «

I SGB won’t select its next Academic Af-

fairs Committee chair untiljan. 21-, but SGB
President Mike Nites said the new Board
will continue the efforts once itselects
a chair. '

we will deﬁnitely continue exploring that,
regardless of who the chair is.”

Board member Brandon Benjamin
worked on the project as the previous

Committee. Benjami_n, now a liaison to

the committee, said he intends to work 1

with the incoming committee to get the
results published. ’ . - ’ V

ranked schools, Jabro said Pitt_needs to

are three different professors, they could
not only consider the time of day and what
their friends say about the professor, but
they could also look at the OMETs to see
who might be best,” Waldeck said.

SGB’s efforts A 3

SGB has a long road ahead of it on its
journey to get OMETS published, and it’s
already been quite atrip.

Jabro and Perera worked with the
Academic Affairs Committee to collect
roughly 550 signatures since they began to
distribute a petition requesting that OMET

results be made public in October 2013. I

Jabro metwith members of the Univer-
sity Faculty Senate’s Educational Policies
Committee lastjanuary to discuss publish-
ing OMET results, according to committee
president Kathleen Kelly. The committee
had been deliberating on whether to pub-

- lish.OMET results for roughly a year when

members met with Jabro.
The committee eventually decided last
February to continue to leave the decision

up to the individual schools within the
University. Kelly said the committee was
cautious about the proposal because the
surveys are designed to give instructors
feedback, and administrators consult the
information when determining whether to
offer instructors promotions and tenure.

Kelly said_on Nov. 18, 2013, that the

committee is still considering the topic, .

but is focusing its efforts on making pro-

fessors responsible for updating course .

descriptions, lengthening the extent of
course information found on Peoplesoft
and making syllabi public before class
registration. '

Perera met with Larry Shuman, senior
associate dean of academic affairs for the
Swanson School of Engineering, in spring
2013 to discuss the possibility of the engi-

neering school publishing its instructors’
results.

Shuman said he is receptive to the idea,
but wants SGB to show him the value of
making the information public to stu-
dents.

Shuman added that he is opposed to

- publishing the open—ended portion of the

link before yeu drive.

surveys. I ’ -

He said he thinks the publication of
results from the multiple—choice portion
pressures instructors to be more efficient
and fair.

“I’m not implying they aren’t conscious
now, but it adds a bit of incentive to make
sure when [the students] go into a class,
it will be a rewarding experience,” Shu-
man said. .

But Shuman said the average rate of
teaching effectiveness reported on OMET
evaluations for professors in his school
already averages four out of five, and the
impact may be small.

Shuman said the decision would most
likely come to a vote by faculty or depart-
ment heads after SGB presents a proposal
to his department. I .

Perera said the Academic Affairs Com-
mittee will present a proposal to the Diet-
rich School of Arts and Sciences next fall.

Faculty concerns

Daniel Mossé, chairman of the Depart-

_ ment of Computer Science, supports pub-

lishing the results, but said the idea has
its disadvantages. ’

DON '

Mossé said the surveys do not tell a
professor’s full story and said the data
from the results can be skewed.

“[The University] would have to do it
very carefully, given that it would have
large implications if the data were to be
misinterpreted,” Mossé said in an email.

Nancy Reilly, director of the OMET
program, told The Pitt News in February
2013 that since the OMET surveys were
switched to the online platform, there
has been a tendency for more extreme
responses on rating scales.

According to Waldeck, publishing
skewed results shouldn’t pose a problem.

“That skewness is going to be around
every course, so it’s something that will be
applied across the board,” Waldeck said.
“It’s going to be comparative.”

Waldeck said if the results are made
public, the results will end up less skewed
because all students would beneﬁt, not just
students who want to see their professor
score a certain way.

Change in response - 1 .

While Waldeck said making the results
public would increase the response rateon
OMET surveys, Jabro said public results
would also change his answers.

jabro said he currently only puts in
comments that will help the professor
improve the course. If the results were to
be made public,‘Jabro said he would leave
advice forother students:

“I would say, ‘Oh, this professor really,

likes to use PowerPoint.’ If someone was
a visual learner and likes to learn from
PowerPoint, they can read that and say,
‘This is someone who I’m going to take,”’
jabro said. '

Freshmen Sophie Greger and Shea
McMurtry and seniorjay Cassidy all said
making the results public would not affect
their responses, but supported the idea.

Temple University

Just across the state, other st.. rents are
already enjoying access to their profes-
sors’ evaluations.

Januaty 17, 2014 | The Pit News I \AA./vvv.pit'mevvs.00m’

V Darin Bartholomew, the .president of
Temple Student Government, said the stu-
dent government members preceding his
term surveyed the student body in 2012
about releasing evaluation results and had
advocated to Temple to. publish the results
for roughly a year.

Bartholomew said the results were '

overwhelmingly positive. Temple Student
Government presented the data and pro-
posed the idea to Temple’s Faculty Senate.

i “There were concerns if [making re-
sults public] was an incentive for profes-

sors to make their classes easier to try and V

appease students, but in the end it went
relatively smoothly,” Bartholomew said.
Bartholomew said Temple students
must complete their evaluations to see
the results. i
Rate My Professors
Even though Pitt does not publish

OMET results, students use other outlets

to browse opinions on professors.
Students often gather information on

professor’s performance ratings on Rate

My Professors, a website with no univer-

sity afﬁliation that lists information for

more than 1.5 million instructors atabout

7,000 schools. .
‘f I

The Website ‘allows students to rate
professors from their respective univer-
sities on one-to—ﬁve’ scales based on how
easy the professor’s class was , how clearly

information was presented, how helpful_
A the professor was and even the instruc-

tor’s physical attractiveness. Perera and
Bartholomew agreed that it was an unreli-
able tool overall for students. ,
“Publishing the results does the profes-
sors a serviceby providing this accurate
information for students to make deci-
sions off of, rather than students running

, to Rate My Professors, where you don’t

know if the person who rated the professor
even goes to this school,” Bartholomew
said.’ . A ‘S V ' 7

Greger, ‘McMurtry and Cassidy said
they have visited this website.

But that doesn’t mean that Having room-
mates is all about conceding. If, for example,

“you enjoy walking around in your under-

that’s just what you do +— then that is totally _

.ﬁne. Your roommates should beopen to
your at—horne wardrobe. ‘ _l .
Also, if you‘ like your coffee pot to be

your roommates know that’s something you

The big thing to remember is that you
should be a better roommate as time goes

“The downside is that [users] can

Other students have still chosen to

S ‘pursue less traditional routes toward

finding housing over the Internet.
V Jacqueline Arvay, a sophomore ima-
joring inpsychology, has used_Facebook

l to find housing at Pitt.

She used a Facebook group called
“Summer at Pitt” to sublet housing for
last summer. Last semester,-—-after she
and her roommate experienced a con-
flict, she was looking for someone to fill
the second bedroom in her apartment.
She‘ found her current roommate on
Facebook. i

‘.‘I felt like it was -almost ‘too late to P

geta roommate, but luckily I found her

_ on Facebook, too,” Arvay said.

She said, that "V finding housing
throughsocial media is a positive ex-
perience, but students might not have
awide_.selection.- i S - - b

“You don’t havethat many choices
online. You can’t venture out and see
what’s actually-out in the open,’’, she
said. i ‘P ‘

Emma Hartman,‘a sophomore ma— '

joring in nursing, is currently in the
process of findingxsogmeone to sublet
her room over the summer through

the ,‘,‘University of Pittsburgh Class of V

2016” Facebook group. She posted in
the group and several people are plan‘-
ning to come look atvher bedroom. She

only knew one ofthose people prior to‘ A

posting.

She. also found roommates fornext '

semester through the “Pitt Nursing”

— Facebook group and found the house

she currently» lives in through the clas-
sified ads section of The Pitt News.
“If you don’t know people you want

to live with, then going through Face- .
‘ book is probably, the easiest, because

you can ﬁnd _s~,ome of your peers that you
may or may not know. If youwanted to

‘go through news or the paper version,

you have to know who you want to live » » "S

with,” she said.
Other students have not met luck in
their online housing search ventures.
Tessa Kerecrrian, a sophomore pre-
medicine student, tried unsuccessfully
toﬁnd a twocbedroom apartment o_n
Craigslist for next semester. ‘She and

her roommate eventually found a place

after seeing a sign on the street.

“It wasn’t very successful,’’. Kerec—
man said. “Every single Craigslist apart-
ment that was listed was either kind

of over—Aprice’dand gross or small, and A

the ones that weren’t overpiricéd were
taken.” ‘ ’ S ‘

Megan Stec, a sophomore studying ’

early childhood education and special

education, posted on the “University

of Pittsburgh Class of 2016” Facebook
group to find a subletter for her apart-
ment over the summer. A .

I For Stec,’the official pages associ-
ated with Pitt are an easy, safe way to
find asubletter, but the lack of acquain-
tance between" two. parties could pose
problems. ’

“Youire not really surehow‘ tidy,
clean, or responsiblethey are,” she said.

“There’s always the fear that they’re i

going to back out at the last minute or
make a messof the place.” I,
