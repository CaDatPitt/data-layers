CLUB SPORTS ’ g
C Pitt Wins its ﬁrst
Ultimate Frisbee

national championship

Pat McAteer
Staff W riter

When Nick Kaczmarek began his
tenure as coach of P.itt’s Ultimate
Frisbee team earlier this year, he
knew he would be inheriting a
talented and experien‘ced group
of student—athletes.

After watching the club sports
team ﬁnish ﬁfth in the nation last
season, Kaczmarek also knew the
players had the mettle to win the
national championship.

They just needed to recognize
it themselves.

“[From] before I started to
coach until now, the greatest-
development we’ve made is this
attitude and integrity and just
holding ourselves accountable,”
Kaczmarek said.

The team’s progress culminat-
ed in Pitt winning its ﬁrst USA
Ultimate Division I College Open
Championship in Boulder, Colo.,
on Monday after a 15-10 victory
over Wisconsin in the ﬁnal.

Although it entered the tour-
nament with the No. 2 seed, Pitt
Ultimate, nicknamed En Sabah
Nur, faced a difficult path to the
title.

After defeating California-Da-
vis, Luther and Texas, Pitt lost to
Michigan in thelﬁnal game of the
preliminary round—robin stage
of the tournament. But En Sabah
Nur, whose name derives from
the Marvel Comics character
Apocalypse, still clinched Pool
B with a 3-1 record.

Pitt rebounded from the loss
to defeat Minnesota easily in the

The ‘Daily Student

 

quarterﬁnals, setting up a semi-
ﬁnal showdown with traditional
power and defending national
champion Carleton College.

Despite falling behind g,8—3
early in the matchup, Pitt roared
back to win the contest by a score
of 14-12. .

Senior Colin Conner, one of
the team’s captains, said the
game was the most memorable
of his career.

‘ “Once we went down 8-3, we
just kept telling everyone to not
give up,” Conner said. “I think
that’s definitely the biggest
memory I’ve had [as an Ultimate
player] .”

In the championship game,
Pitt sought to avoid the dra-
matics of the previous game by
scoring early and often. Led by
senior Alex Thorne, the Panthers
quickly opened a 4-0 lead and
kept their foot on thegas the rest
of the way.

After registering several
points and assists for the Pan-
thers throughout the contest,
Thorne clinched the title with
a 15th and final point thanks to
a scoring pass to his younger
brother,,freshman Max Thorne.

Going into the championship
game, Conner said members of
En Sabah Nur felt that they had
the upper hand on Wisconsin be-
cause of Pitt’s superior prepara-
tion throughout the season.

’ “We just knew that we were
in better condition than them,”
Conner said. “When we started

Coaches dominate highest-paid
    list, chancellor ranks fourth

Pat McAteer
Stew" Wrz'ter

If Chancellor Mark Nordenberg
wants to expand his wallet, he’d
be wise to trade in his academic
regalia for a coaching whistle.
-In Pitt’s most recent federal
tax filing, which covers July 1,
2010 throughjune 30, 2011, for-
mer head football coach Dave
Wannstedt and current men’s

basketball coach Jamie Dixon
topped the list of highest—paid
Pitt employees. Nordenberg

came in at No.4.

»Nordenberg’s total package
amounted to $707,190, which
included $468,934 in base com-
pensation, $78,188 in bonus and
incentive compensation, $66,185
in retirement or deferred com-
pensation, $67,359 in nontaxable
beneﬁts and $26,524 in other re-
portable income.

 

According to The Chronicle of
Higher Education’s website, Nor-
denberg’s pay placed him 40th in
terms of salary among presidents
of public universities in the U.S..

While Nordenberg’s sal-
ary ranked highly among Pitt
employees, few came close to
Wannstedt in terms of total com-
pensation.

One hundred years from now, Americans
will open a time capsule extracted from the
cornerstone of Soldiers 8: Sailors Memorial
Hall — and many hope they’ll see better
results than the last capsule yielded.

Although the artifacts in the last time
capsule, placed in the Soldiers & Sailors
cornerstone in 1908, were not preserved at
the time of their retrieval a century later, the
memorial’s staff chose to revive the tradi-
tion in Monday’s Memorial Day ceremony,
where local political ﬁgures like Mayor Luke
Ravenstahl spoke to honor members of the
armed forces.

Ravenstahl spoke at the ceremony to ex-
press his gratitude for those in the service.
He explained that after spending a week
with the Department of Defense as part of
the Joint Civilian‘ Orientation Conference
that began in late April, he was amazed by
the degree of dedication displayed by the

armed forces. ,

“I can tell you our country is in good
hands,” the mayor said;

Congressman Mike Doyle, D-Pittsburgh,
shared his appreciation for the honor- that
Soldiers & Sailors Memorial Hall pays to the
veterans it commemorates.

“Today is the day we remember,” Doyle
said. “Over a million men and women have
given their lives ﬁghting for this nation. This
is our region’s way of saying we remember
the men and women of this country. This
building must never close.”

Much like Soldiers 8: Sailors, the time
capsule’s purpose is to beneﬁt future. gen-
erations with knowledge of their history.

for Soldiers 8: Sailors, said that all the indi-
vidual pieces placed inside the capsule form

son, Wannstedt earned a total compen-
sation‘ package of $1.86 million, includ-
ing $936,930 in base compensation and
$855,000 in bonus and incentivepay.

Following Wannstedt on the list of top
Pitt earners was Dixon, who earned $1.83
million, with $978,154 in base compensa-
tion and $681,905 in bonus and incentive
pay.

Wannstedt‘ and Dixon’s salaries re-
ﬂect the growth of college athletics as a
profitable business. According to the U.S.
Department of Education, Pitt’s football
and basketball programs generate about
$5.1 million and $7.1 million in profits,

Arthur Levine, senior vice chancellor
for the health sciences and clean of Pitt’s
school of medicine, was the third highest-
paid employee at the University, with a
total compensation package of $829,575
and a base pay of $720,057.

Pursuant to Pitt’s status as a state-relat-
ed institution, the University is required to

cluding its five highest-paid non-officers,
as well as the pays of all University ofﬁcers.

sonnel, Pitt also disclosed its ﬁve largest
contractors. At the top of the list was So-
dexo, which provides food services total-
ing $27.5 million. The four other listed
were construction contractors, including
P.J. Dick Inc. at $26.2 million. '

These contractors worked on projects
at Pitt’s main campus as well as the Uni-
versity’s four regional campuses.

In total, Pitt had a revenue of around
$2.2 billion, with tuition accounting for
$642.2 million, or around 29 percent.

from grants and contracts totaling $831.9
million, or around 37 percent. This doesnft
include the state’s contribution of around
$218 million. .

In terms of spending, Pitt allocated
$463 million toward instruction and $138
million on academic support as well as

Pitt recognized for
environmental strides

Pat McAteer
Staff Wrz'ter

Pitt’s reputation as an environmentally
friendly campus continues to grow as
surely as one of the school’s new rooftop
gardens. .

In its “Guide to Green Colleges,” The
Princeton Review, a publication that pro-
vides overviews of colleges across the na-
tion, awarded Pitt’s Oakland campus a 92

out ofa possible 100 points. The publica— _

tion recognized Pitt’s “notable commit-
ment to sustainability in  academic of-
ferings, campus infrastructure, activities
and career preparation.”

In its quest to be more “green,” Pitt’s
administration has mandated that all
new campus buildings and renovations
incorporate sustainable features into their
design.

“We’re working
to find ways to
positively impact
the environment
and quallw of life

as well as educate  

students in
sustainability.”

Gena Kovalcik

Laura Zullo, senior manager of capital
and special projects with Pitt’s Facilities
Management Division, said in an email
that all new projects include energy-sav-
ing control strategies, such as occupancy
sensors that control lighting in campus
buildings. V

- In addition, Zullo "said the University
has placed an emphasis on the recycling
of materials used in construction and de-
molition. She added that Pitt recycled 95
percent of waste from the addition placed
on Chevron Hall and 75 percent from the
renovations to Benedum Hall.

Zullo also said that Pitt has -three

tal Design gold certified buildings — the

Medicine, the Mascaro Center for Sus-
tainable Innovation and Benedum Hall’s
renovation. The LEED certiﬁcation rates
la-bui‘lding‘bas'edloln sustainability, energy
efficiency and gréenconstruction. .

Although Pitt«lha’s made greatstrides in
sustainable construction, Zullo said the
work is only beginning‘. '

“Ten additional projects are pursuing
LEED certification, and even projects that

H don’t pursue this certification incorporate
sustainable design,” Zullo said. “Sustain- _

able construction is a standard practice
at Pitt.” '

Along with sustainable construction on
campus, The Princeton Review also rec-
ognized Pitt for its campus‘ greenery and
dedication to environmental education.

Gena Kovalcik, co-director of the Swan-
son School of Engineering’s Mascaro Cen-
ter for Sustainable Innovation, said the
department worked to educate students
on sustainability.

“We’re working to ﬁnd ways to posi-
tively impact the environment and qual-
ity of life as well as educate students on
sustainability,” Kovalcik said.

Kovalcik said one of the newest pro-
grams underwritten by Mascaro was a
“sustainability scavenger hunt” during
PittStart sessions throughout thelsumlrlner,
where new students search out sustainable
models on campus.

Student Government Board Member]u—
lie Hallinan, an environmental committee
liaison, added that the group was working

with Sodexo to compost used coffee beans

from coffee carts across campus.‘ V
She said they planned to grow mush-
rooms in the compost, which Sodexo could
use while cooking. '
“With the mushrooms, they’re going
to sell them back to Market Central from

what we compost from different coffee i

carts,” Hallinan said.

Hallinan also said the environmental
committee met with Vice.Provost and Dean
of Students Kathy Humphrey to build.a
“power ﬂower.” She said this technology
could power laptops through solar energy
during the day and night for students who
choose to use their laptops outdoors.

SGB member Gordon Louderback, the
Board’s liaison to the environmental com-
mittee, said Pitt’s Green Fund has an an-
nual budget of $5,000, which is provided
by the Student Government Board from
the Student Activity Fund, to undertake
sustainable projects. He added that an
example of this includes the “hydration
stations” which are located in the William
Pitt Union and Hillman Library.

Louderback also said theicomm-ittee
is working to cut down waste emitted by
the University. 0

“We work with the administration
to get rid of all plastic bags and Sodexo
waste,” Louderback said. “We’re looking
to. make the campus more sustainable in
the.long run.3.’,- “ ‘ ’ is '

THE STAMATTACK

Facebook’s targeted ads escend
into the uncanny Valle

“just woke up. I think I’ll use some
of my Listerine—brand mouthwash.-
So refreshing!”

' This is the future Facebook en— g

visions. Statuses like this are what
will move the company forward.
At least,»this is what I have as-
certained from the ﬂurry of inter-
views and news stories surround-
ing Facebook’s entry into the New

York Stock Exchange. The value of ~

Facebook isn’t just that it knows a
bunch of information about you
—-— Google, which is valued lower,
knows just as much — but that the
company will somehow be able to
tap into the site’s social element to
extract massive payoffs.

When it comes to the speciﬁcs

. of achieving these payoffs, details

are somewhat lacking. In one

interview,‘ Facebook CEO Mark‘

dill?-Dhélwatchesas a lpﬁooramimermworksyatuFacebook‘ | Cl” Campus

Zuckerberg spoke of how compa-
nies can aggregate the ‘likes’ of
various product lines to get a good
sense of popular opinion. While

the site no-longer uses‘ Beacon, an

ad service designed to broadcast
purchases togfriends, the practice
of “friending”‘brandrpages sends
a similar message: “I-,-W-your friend,
like this brand. You slifould, too.”

These. two programs, along
with a number offféthers, are
admittedly. in their beta phases.
The speciﬁcs’ of how facebook will
make gazillions of dollars are hazy,
but the broad’ picture is clear:
Something about theisocial aspect
makes the companygvaluable.

But befo,__re,quitti;§g college to

T Many  kngiifof the un-

canny valley from robotics. The
idea is that we love robots that
are only slightly humanlike, like
Roomba vacuums and Wall-E —
with their disproportionate bod-

actually cute. We can also handle
robots that are 100 percent indis-

— quaint and unassuming.
On the opposite side lies Google, which
aggregates searches made over months to

directly target users through banner ads. All ’

over the Internet, Google’s Adsense targets
you directly with services and products you
probably want. This might seem terrifying
in concept, but in practice, it is all almost
too tricky to be_d_etected. Cataloging thou-
sands of searches, it is hard to pinpoint a

search for ﬂy—ﬁshing rods and an eventual .

ad on an unrelated, but somehow relevant,

valley. Facebook is not just a net catch-
ing our every subconsciouswhim via web
searches — what we put on Facebook is very
precise. Instead of our private activities, it
reﬂects our public personas. So when you
see an advertisement on Facebook, you can
quickly guess what prompted the match.
A recent example of this poppedup on
my newsfeed. A Pitt student took a screen-
shot of his ads, and itwas very apparent all

. of the information was based on one or two

points from his proﬁle. This was not like

Google’s sneaky ads —— allit did was prompt

him to call the whole thing ridiculous.
In ﬁtting irony, everybody else who
commented on the picture-startécftalking

to everyone that ads were based on proﬁle
information. Facebook users were using so-
cial networking not to talk about the newest
ﬂavor of Listerine, but to complain about
the obviousness of the targeting.

Perhaps Facebook can overcome this.~

Maybe there is a way to make their meth-
ods a bit less-obvious. When Target got in
trouble for using purchasing patterns to
send targeted advertisements to people

they judged to be pregnant, they developed‘
_ a far more subversive method of alternating

targeted: ads and general ads — leaving cus-

itome'r‘s'unaware of the tracking and more
open to the messages. After a dip in sales .

from the creépiness, sales have recovered

-. and customers are now generally unaware A

that they are tracked. ,
But don’t just assume Facebook will make
this leap. Everybody knows all our activities
are tracked on the web, but when this real-
ity smacks us in the face, we don’t like it.
.What we search in Google or buy at Target

A’ just seems more anonymous. Facebook,"

being-a much more limited and concen-
trated avenue than Google while serving as
a shrine to everything “us,” will always have
"the problem of anti—anonymity.

So you shouldn’t be too jealous that
Zuckerberg has more money than .you will
ever possibly have. At least you can rest
easy knowing he probably won’t be able to
completely control the world‘. '

Edward Sharpe & The
Magneticzeros . *

Community MusicNagrant
Records

Grade: A-

Sounds like: Fleet Foxes

In a time when most artists work to
pump out music at a rapid pace, the

V ‘ indie-rock-infused-folk group Ed-
ward Sharpe &the Magnetic Zeros

took its time to ensure its success.
Edward Sharpe 8: the Mag-
netic Zeros will soon release its
sophomore album Here as a strong
follow—up to its first CD, continuing‘
the band’s success. '_
Releasing its debut album Up
From Below only about a year af-

ter forming, the eight-person, Los
Angeles—based band quickly cata-
pulted up the charts, reaching the
76th spot on the Billboard top 200
chart in 2oo9. .

Although the success of its
second album has yet to be mea-
sured, the group’s past. success
foreshadows the strength of its
newest album.

Edward Sharpe isa ﬁctional
messianic character created by

group frontrnan Alex Ebert. He

explained that the character came

‘ to Earth originally as a healer and

savior of mankind, but instead
ended up constantly diverted by
love and women. ,
Ebert created the band’s name-
sake after a low point in his life
during which he and his girlfriend
broke up. He then joined’Alco—
holics Anonymous and slept on a

blow-up mattress in a small L.A.

apartment.

The avid partier and former
lead singer of pop band Ima Ro-
bot might not be the messianic
character he envisioned, but his

music has no problem attracting‘

followers as if Ebert were a new
prophet. -
Although Ebert and his psyche-

delic band have gained a legion of ‘

fans, they have yet to let their fame
affect their music. They continue

to come up with tracks that seem .

to both soothe the soul and make

it question the existence of ghosts

at the same time; ’
Ebert’s‘uniq’ue sound propels

3 Here to new heights. The album’s‘

ﬁrst track, “Man On Fire,” begins
with the frontman’s signature
vocals, relying on his Bob Dylan-
esque folk style to dr'aw listeners
into a trance —— complete with a
walking baseline  that lasts four
minutes. A

The echoes of fellow bandmates

Chris Richard and Tylerjames be-

hind Ebert’s voice give the song

an almost sacred feel, turning the

' track into a melodicchant that

will have audiences easily sing-
ing along. The combination of

the group’s voices translate to a’

rich sound that demonstrates the
members’ passion forlrnusic.

, The skillful blend of horns, gui-
tars and both male and female vo-
calists create tracks such as “May—
la,” a tune that allows listeners to
hear just how talentedthis group
really is. The slow, rhythmic beat
allows each_ form of instrumenta-
tion its own showcaseg,

tracks are Iak_in to slow-paced

Season end fo Panthers at Big Eastctournament 

Dustin Gabler
Se7zz’or' Stqﬂ Wrz'ter

The Pitt baseball team saw its sea-
son come to an end last week with
back—to—back losses that came on
consecutive days.

After barely qualifying for the Big

East tournament in Clearwater, Fla., V

following a strong ﬁnish to the.regu—
lar season, the No. 8-seed Panthers
faced a daunting task in the double-
elimination bracket.

As the ﬁnal team in the tour-
nament, Pitt’s ﬁrst matchup came
against top-seeded Louisville.

Louisville 8, Pitt 4

Pitt manager Joe _]ordano’s club
played close with Louisville in the

last series of the regular season as W

the Panthers picked up the win they
needed to earn a rematch with the
Cardinals in the Big East tourna-
ment. ‘   _ 3 H

With the conﬁdence of knowing
they were capable of beating the

Cardinals, the Panthers headed into - 1

Wednesday’s‘tournament-opening
game. ,

" V But Louisville’s offense struck
ﬁrst, off Pitt senior pitcher Matt
Iannazzo, with a run in both the sec-
ond and third innings. The Cardinals

added two moreinthe fourth to take

a 4-0 lead.
Pitt earned one of the runs back

in the ﬁfth when freshman catcher 1
Elvin Soto connected on a solo home ‘

run to start the inning.

And the Panthers got even closer
with two runs in the seventh inning
to narrow the lead to just one run.

The scoring in that inning started

when Soto crossed the plate follow-

ing a double by sophomore outﬁeld-

 

Anthony DeFabio (6) and the Panthers finished the season at 28-28. Anthony Gima | For The Pitt News

driven in when senior designated‘

hitter Anthony DeFabio singled.

ond to end the inning, stranding

Earlier in the week, Devereaux

and the two other seniors, DeFabio ‘

list. V - _
“Beingthe all—timewins leaderin
Pitt history, that’s very special,”Jor—

of that. We’re going to miss him.”
The Cardinals took advantage of

a poor showing from Pitt’s bullpen

by scoring four runs in the eighth

i inning to put the game out of reach

for the Panthers.

.. “It’s hard losing because I,"
pitched well,” Iannazzo said. “We L
fought hard to make it close, butin

the end, it wasn’t enough.”

— USF 12, Pitt 5

Pitt’s season began tounravel in

the third inning of an elimination
‘ game against South Florida. -

With Pitt sophomore pitcher
Ethan Mildren on the mound, the
Bulls connected for six runs when
rain forced the umpires to delay the

.game for more than three hours.
South Florida was already up 7-0.
When the players returned to the
ﬁeld, Jordano put sophomore Matt
_Wotherspoon on the mound to try to
end the trouble, but the Bulls plated
two more runs to ﬁnish off an eight-
 inningthatgave them an

 ‘insurrnountable 9-0 adv_antage.

The Panthers attempft-"ed a come-

   

back in the ﬁfth inningwith four runs
to cut the deﬁcit by nearly half, but
it just wasn’t enough. Pitt’s season

ended with the team owning a 28-’ 

28 record.

Although Jordano will lose his
best two hitters and top pitcher in
seniors Devereaux, DeFabio and
Iannazzo, several underclassmen
stepped into big roles this season
and will look to lead the team in 2013.

Devereaux’s senior campaign
ended with him leading the Pan-
thers in batting average (.372), hits
(86), home runs (7), runs batted in
(54), total bases (124) and slugging
percentage (.537). _,

DeFabio led in most of the other
statistics with team highs in on-base
percentage (.448), runs (53), walks
(31) and hit-by—pitches (17).

The two players transferred to
Pitt from Duquesne two seasons
ago after the Dukes’ program was
canceled. 3

“When Rick and Anthony came
over from Duquesne, itwas great
to give them an opportunity to play
for us,”]ordano said. “They blended

in so well and did such a great jolt

for us.” . 7

Pitt willhave returning starters at
every position except ﬁrst base and
designated hitter, with star fresh-
men Soto and Boo Vazquez returning
after breakout years.

Also back for the Panthers will be

Kauffman said winning the national

‘ championship provided a great deal of

knowledge and experience that he plans
to pass on to incoming freshmen and new
players. g ' A

As a program, winning the national
championship is a testament to how much
En Sabah Nur has grown since its begin-
nings. According to its website, the team
was founded in the spring of 1998 when a
group of students living on the third ﬂoor

, of Sutherland West began playing Ultimate

behind the Cost Center.

After gaining a following on campus, V

the group participated in its first tourna-
ment in April 1998.

Kaczmarek said the growth from a
fledgling group of freshmen to a national
power can be attributed to the efforts of
the players on the team not only this year,
but also throughout their time as team-
mates on En Sabah Nur.

And he doesn’t think winning a national
championship should deter the program
from working even harder to accomplish
its goals for next season. -

“We’ve got to. have the humility to
prepare and the conﬁdence to compete,”

-KacZmar¢k said i‘ C I 1?
