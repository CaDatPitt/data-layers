 Chest Collects About $4,500;  
% Dent School Contributes 100%

Pitt’s Chest drive emerged
from the recent campaign
with the respectable total

of approximately $4500, ac-
cording to Ronald Ecker,
chairman of the Chest Drive.
Of this total. the Dental School
topped the list with an"$800,
100% contribution. There are
400 students in the Dent School,
each of whom contributed two
dollars.

Ecker pointed out that this is
not the first time that the dents
have made their goal in such
drives, as they have been consist-
ent in leading the other schools in
the past.

Figures Not Exact

.“The $4500 total is not exact,”
Ecker said in summing up the
campaign, “but when all the
money that has been pledged is
handed in, the ﬁgures will balance
very closely.”

Although the 1951 drive netted
close to $1,000 more than last
year's campaign. Ecker thought
that “a University with so large an
enrollment should be able to raise
an even larger amount.”

Broken down by schools, the
$4500 represents the contributions
of 14 different groups.

Miscellaneous schools are listed
as paying $425.20 and pledging
$589.50. Education students came
through with $61.04 in cash and
pledges amounting to $89.50.

 Pharmacy students evened
things up by pledging $55.75 and

paying an additional ‘$55.94. Grad-
ﬂute iand non-degree students con-
tributed $55.80 and pledged an
even $37.

Nurses Give $82.90

The Bureau of Retail Training
cashed in with $66.17 and $4.00 in
pledges, while pre-law students
tallied $33.05 in cash and $9.00 in
pledges. Medical students and the
future nurses totaled $82.90 and
$39.70, respectively. . ‘

Dental School students paid
their $800 in cash.

 French Girl Can’t Get in French Cluh

Life in these United States is a bit confusing to Colette‘ 5

French Club at Pitt, it isn't enough that you speak, think,
read French and hail from France. You must be a sopho-

Poll Boxes

Suggestion boxes have been in-
stalled by Student Congress to poll
student opinions on three major
questions facing the governing
body at present.

These boxes,
at c c o r ding to
Tom Piemme.
h e a d of the
Suggestion Box
committee, have
have been plac-
ed at S t a t e
Hall,, the Stu-
dent Desk and
on the eighth
ﬂoor. These lo-
c a t i o n s a r e
temporary.

The purpose of this project is to
discover student feelings on the
idea of establishing a second news-
paper, having women cheerlead-
ers, and the faculty rating plan.

Poll sheets are now available at
the Student Desk and on the
eighth floor.

The committee hopes to set up
seven permanent boxes sometime
this semester for general student
use.

All students were urged by Dan
Berger, chairman of the polling
committee to turn in their votes
before leaving school.

 

¢The eight-page publication,

the
College Tumor, was banned Fri-
day night by Frederick H. Turner,
the University's dean of students.
Turner said the Tumor, publishedl
once a year by the Illinois chapter

of Sigma Delta Phi, professional,
journalism fraternity, contained‘;
objectionable material. ‘

Turner today ordered the chap-
ter’s fund frozen pending an in-
vestigation of the incident by the
student senate.

The dean halted sale of the pub-
lication some nine hours after it
appeared on the campus. Most of
the 11,000 copies printed had been
sold prior to the ban.

Turner said the Tumor’s editors
showed “obvious lack of good
judgment.” The Tumor poked fun
at University officials and the Il-
linois football team, and contained
several pictures of scantily clad
women.

A fraternity spokesman said he
hoped the Chapter’s fund would be
released by Wednesday when
chapter delegates are planning to
leave for the fraternity’s national
convention at Detroit.

Put Gripes ‘in Boxes '
"G A In an earnest effort to ﬁnd out where their constituents
stand on the various issues up for discussion in Student
Congress, our legislators have placed suggestion boxes at
points throughout the University. They are hoping these
students who loudly claim Congress is not representative
it-will avail themselves of the opportunity to unburden them-
"selves. ‘

, The Congressmen, unlike their national counterparts,
too often ﬁnd themselves faced with a vast and consuming»
indifference; that is, until they do something unpopular.
“Then they discover that there are some people who take
, an interest in their affairs.

* These people, however, are not interested in anything
which is quietly successful or unobtrusively necessary.
They want only to express themselves on sensational and
partisan issues, and often this expression is political in
nature or ridiculing in intent.

, » Since there are few indications that the situation will
change in the near or distant future, the suggestion boxes
are probably the best methods of sampling student_opinion.
They have the advantage of ease and availability.

If, however, the boxes are to be true reﬂections of stu-
dent feeling, they should be properly handled and policed.
There should always be a member of Congress on duty at
the_ boxes to explain the issues on »-the ballot and to guard
against stuffing. To date the boxes have been unwatched.
W We need not point out that the entire project could be
wasted by one individual who took it on himself to repre-
sent the entire voting public by ﬁlling out all of the bal-
lotshimself. It will be easy and tempting as long as no
one swatches theboxes.

sure it’s a chorus. ~

(A meeting for everyone interested in reviv-
ing Cap and Gown will be held Friday afternoon
at 4:30 in 832 C1.) _

So far, student reaction to revival of the all-
male Cap and Gown club is enthusiastic, C&G
alumni reaction is mixed, and the Administration
is pessimistic.

Tito Bnaunstein, law school
student who was president of
the 1947 club, thinks that Cap
and Gown shows should be ‘re-
vived. ’ A

“I haven’t heard as good\an
idea since I graduated,” Tito de-
clared. “No organization I was
in at Pitt gave me more com-
radeship and satisfaction. There ‘,
are plenty of alumni who would  . 
be willing to work with men.who earnestly want-
to bring Cap and Gown back to Pitt.”

“I think a show might even be put on at Spring
Festival this year,” he. added.

  

Reis is Gloomy

G. Norman Reis, who co-authored the Pitt
Victory Song and wrote about a dozen of the Cap
and Gown shows, is gloomy about the chances
for revival.

“I enjoyed Cap and Gown Min its heyday but
now I’m afraid it’s a lost cause. It’s matter of
dollars and cents. It was a wonderful show,
though, and a’ good advertisement for the Uni-
versity.” "

His attitude was an echo of the one expressed
by Dean of Men Theodore W. Biddle, who says
with a grin that he never was good enough to
make a Cap and Gown chorus .girl. He worked

Loyalty Oath to Return

Recess is over for the Pennsylvania legislatures
in less than two weeks. And on or after Dec.
10, the date the Senate and the House of Repre-
sentatives reconvene, the House will begin delib-
eration on the revised Senate Bill 27.

The bill, introduced by Senator Pechan early
this year, would require an oath of loyalty to the
constitutions of the United States
and of Pehnsylvania from all
state employees and employees
of state supported institutions.
The Pitt faculty comes under
this last category.

Last Spring, heads of the
four state-supported universi-
ties; Pitt, Penn State, University
of Pennsylvania, and Temple, ap-
peared in Harrisburg at hear- 
ings on S. B. 27. They opposed it. »

has been amended. It is still opposed by leaders

Letters To The Editor . . .

Editor
The Pitt News

I would like to clear up some misconceptions
about the purpose of having two student newspa-
pers at Pitt, and my reasons for bringing the idea
to Student Congress.

‘The first misconception is that it would become
a tool for factions, the fraternities, the independents,
or some other student organization. This is the
exact oposite of the_purpose. _ ‘

The first and foremost purpose of having two
competing newspapers is to interest the great silent
mtjority of students at Pitt in their_ school. At
present only a vocal minority care a “hoot” about
Pitt and its ‘activities. “ i

The Michigan State train flopped because the
News and Congress have failed and. are failing to

’ interest this silent majority. There should have been

a thousand pledges in the blood drive and would
have been had the News not failed to interest any-
one but the vocal minority. At school social func-
tions this vocal minority always shows up but no
one else.

The Pitt News at present is gathered from and
written for this vocal minority,~1and, in truth it can
do no otherwise. 6500 copies are always printed,
whether they are read orwnot. It however-the paper V

“Cap and Gown was lots of fun and lots of
grief,” he said.

The shows were a ﬁne outlet for student talent,
he agreed, giving a substantial number of stu-,
dents experience in the business, technical and
creative aspects of show business. '

Finances Needed

But he pointed out that the University will be
cool toward any proposal to bring back the C&G
club unless a practical method of financing the
shows is found.

The annual revenues never made fortunes, the
dean explained, and frequently the University had
to make up a deﬁcit of several hundred dollars
because of the high cost of union stagehands and
musicians at the old Nixon.

Despite this, there is a group of able and active

' students interested in reviving the club. Thu’

know they face that old problem——“Where ya

gonna get“ the money?” , l .
Stan Goldman, one of the students most enf-

thusiastic and willing to work for a revival club,

is convinced that the show could be made finan- ,

cially practical.

He and the rest of the students who have come
up to the News office to enlist will get together
Friday afternoon at 4:30 p.m. in 832 Cl.

“We hope every student who would like to
see the Cap and Gown tradition revived will come
to this meting, Goldman said yesterday.

Will Cap and Gown, a Pitt tradition for well
over a quarter of a century, he allowed to die?

Engle Credits Hamilton
On Pitt’s Fine Showing

0‘ By DON SCHURMAN '

Although Coach ‘Rip’ Engle of Penn State couldn’t con-
ceal his disappointment over Saturday’s thriller, he had
nothing but praise for the Pitts after the game.

“Tom Hamilton has done a wonderful job with his
boys,” he said. “They really deserved it, but it was a hard-

fought game.”

The amiable Engle then broke away from the newsmen,

and since the game was State’s
last of the season, he spoke a few
words of farewell to each of his
players-—words like, “Keep on
those books, Jim.” and “How’s the
shoulder, Bob.”
=l< It *

Engle’s brief, but effective half-
time speech to the Nittanies nearly
sparked State to '
an early sec-
ond-half drive.
“Okay, we gave
them a break,”
Engle charged.
“Now let’s get
ours.”

All keyed-up,
th e Nittanies
burst out of the
dressing r o o m
and q u i c kl y
racked up two
first downs. Left halfback Ted
Shattuck then fumbled away the
ball, however, to end a possible
State threat.

Meanwhile, the Pitt dressing
room was a scene of wild jubila-

 

Engle

tion——the happiest Pitt post-game
scene of the season.

Amid the gaiety, the team clus-
.tered around Captain Hamilton for
a group picture. The atmosphere
in the dressing room was aptly ex-
pressed by Bobby Bestwick who
vowed, “We’re going to win the
next one and start the team on a
winning streak for next year.”

The University of Miami marks the ﬁnal game on Pitt’s

Quarterback Bestwick, 174-pound senior from Shaler

Most of the passing records for-

a three or four-year stretch. Best-
wick and Warriner, however, per-

To make their feats even more
brilliant both of them were ham-
pered by injuries. Bestwick missed
the Notre Dame game and the sec-
ond half of the (Iowa game. War-
riner played only seconds of the
Irish tilt and caught onepass.

Bobby has attempted 167 passes

Coaches Praise Line

After State Triumph

By BORIS VVEINSTEIN

Pitt coaches waltzed happi-
ly around the Panther dress-
ing room Saturday congratu-
lating their proteges after beating
Penn State, 13-7, for their second
grid victory.

The Panthers had ﬁnally reached
their season’s peak in line play,
balanced offense, and aggressive-
ness, and the coaching staff, from
head mentor Tom Hamilton to the
scouting party, was very much
satisﬁed.

‘Defense Reaches Peak

Pitt's defensive forward wall——
which hasn’t permitted the foe to
score a touchdown rushing in ten
straight periods—received t h e i r
part of the praise.

NCAA’s Too
Tough For Pitt

Carl Olson’s cross country squad
just couldn’t measure up to na-
tional competition Monday, as they

ﬁnished tenth in the NCAA meet
at East Lansing, Michigan.

Captain Frank Kuzma was the
only Panther to ﬁnish in the first
25, garnering a 23rd. The rest of
the local harriers were just along
for the ride, however, as Hurb
Semper, Kansas University speed
merchant, successfully defended
his title with a ﬂashing 20:09.5
run.

The Blue-and-Gold thinclads
regained some of their lost glory,
last Saturday, however, in making
a clean sweep in the AAU Senior
cross country meet at Schenley
Park.

Bernie Luterancik was the win-
ner with the time of 22:58.4. Fol-
lowing him were‘ teammates Frank
Kuzma, Don DelliGatti, Ken Ma-
lianna, Dick Weber, and Dan Som-

mer.

“They’ve learned a great deal

By DON MURDOCK

Editor

Pitt won its game last Saturday in convincing style,

but a more impressive sight came after the game at Fall!‘

School above the Stadium.

There, approximately 70 high school football play-
ers from Pennsylvania and Ohio were guests of the Uni-'

versity.

The schoolboy standouts ate heartily, heard short talks

from the coaching staff, had briefO -———-—----—~'

and informal chats with the staﬂ,l
and ﬁlled out forms.
Coaches Have A Place

These forms presented such rou— i
tine questions as name, age, highj
school, sports participated in and,
how many years, system used, and ‘
position played. The most import- ,
ant item was the space open for‘
the ..'.z.-ne of the player's coach.

Captain Hamilton explains,
“In this way we can cross-check
the ability of a player by talk-
ing to his coach and also coaches
of schools that have faced his
team.”

It was also gratifying to see
close to 20 high school coaches at
the informal gathering. And these
coaches seemed to enjoy the pro-
gram as much as the players.
Prospects Are Well-Scouted

In the past Pitt has been very
weak even to the point of discour-
aging high school coaches from
sending their standout players to
Skyscraper U, but now Hamilton
has come to the conclusion that the
best way to get Pennsylvania ball

players to come to Pitt is through ‘

their coaches.

Pitt’s coaching staff has been
kept busy each week scouting at
high school games. At Friday
night’s Class AA WPIAL ﬁnal,
assistant coaches Steve Hokuf
and Steve Petro were busy tak-
ing notes on collegiate prospects.

For Pitt to rise to the top in col-
legiate circles it must get material.
There’s no problem in ﬁnding this
material because it is already here
—-right in western Pennsylvania.

lludy Mattioli Silver Lining

 

Maybe it’s in Greenville or maybe
in Claysville.
It’s Huntin’ Time Again

The fact is it’s here and Pitt has
to get it before the invading hordes
of southern and midwest scouts
make this area another happy
hunting ground.

Hamilton doesn’t like the meth-
ods of these schools. He calls the
high school prospects traitors and
informs The Pitt News that in the
future it will be University policy
to stay clear of scheduling schools
that make wholesale raids on west-
ern Pennsylvania high school stars.

Which goes to prove that the
December 7 date with Miami
will probably be the last since
the Hurricanes have 18 Pennsyl-
vania boys on its roster.

If last Saturday‘s post game
program was an indication of
things to come, maybe Miami,
Michigan State, Notre Dame and
a host of others won’t boast of so
many Pennsylvania gridders.

Yes, Saturday's game was won’

on the playing ﬁeld, but future
contests may have been won at
Fall: School.

F or Blue-and-Cold Future

There is a silver lining in

Pitt’s black football clouds in

the shape of freshman quarterback Rudy Mattioli.

. Rudy, whose cousin Fran was an outstanding lineman for
the Blue-and-Gold when the Panthers wore red and white
uniforms and usually ended up black and blue after severe
gridiron beatings, has been a T signal caller ever since he

in "39.

reported for football to Coach Neil Brown at Har—Brack high

L7 .9 played three years of varsity
competition on the Class AA
WPIAL team, two of these years as
first string quarterback.

All-State Selection

In his senior year Rudy piloted
I-Iar-Brack to an 8-1-1 record and
earned an 01-  "
fensive b e r t h i
on Pennsylva- ,
nia's All - State ’
eleven.

He helped to »
open the new ‘
South High ‘j”_
Stadium 1 a s t 
8 u m m e r b y
pl a y in g f o r
W a l ter Gross’ 7
County eleven
‘that copped a
13-6 verdict over the West Penn
stars in the annual Jaycee grid
classic.

Young Mattioli decided to follow
the example of another district lad,
Vito (Babe) Parilli of Rochester,
Pa. and play his college football
for Paul Bryant’s Kentucky Wild-
‘cats.

.,,.

    

Mattioli .

Kentucky Transfer

During the summer the Dental
aspirant took nine credits at Ken-
tucky, but soon found that south-
ern hospitality is not all that it is
cracked up to be and transferred
to Pitt for the fall semester.

The fresh quarterback is ineligi-
ble to play Varsity ball this year
because of the NCAA ruling that
prohibits transfers from big time
competition for two semesters. He
did however, salvage something

ule by guiding the _Panther Cubs
to a 33-13 romp over Kiski Prep.

Mattioli was not just a one sport
man in high school for two of his
four varsity letters were for play-
ing guard on the basketball team.
He coyly asserts,’ however, that
his athletic activities at Pitt will
be limited to the gridiron only.

With an increasing number of
district boys coming to Pitt, the
dark clouds on the Panther foot-
ball horizon are bound to break.

And when the Blue-and-Gold
does regain its old prestige, you
can be sure that boys of the cali-
bre of Mattioli will be in the fore-
front.

As Castoffs\Eliminate Onyx

By RUSSELL FRANKE

Intramural football moved
into the ﬁnal playoff stages
M o n d a y as the Castoffs
downed SS Onyx, 8-0.

The win kept the Castoffs’ unde-
feated streak alive at nine games
and tosses them into the cham-
pionship scramble with the two
fraternity powerhouses —-— Sigma
Chi and Psi Omega, who are like-
wise unbeaten.

Lewis Scores TD
In the first period of this week’s

opener, Castoff B o b b y Lewis.

sprung loose on a 20-yard touch-
down jaunt from scrimmage. The
winners nursed the six-point lead
until the ﬁnal seconds of the first
half when the Onyx received an-
other blow.

4!

Gil Bucci blocked an Onyx punt
on the goal, and the ball skittered
over the end-line to give the
Castoffs two points on a safety.
But in .the ﬁght for possession of
the slippery pigskin Al Conrad of
Onyx suffered a shoulder separa-
tion and was taken away for med-
ical attention.

Defense Sparkles

In the second half, the hard-
charging Onyx took the initiative
in an effort to cut the 8-0 lead.
With the aid of a 15-yard penalty
imposed by Referee Leo Bemis

Dent Students Ila vet Tough
Grind, But The y like It

BY CLARK SUTTON

If your one of the many who grow weak at the sight of a
dentist’s drill, then don’t visit any of the Dental School
buildings. For in these buildings are all the tortures of a
dentist’s office multiplied by hundreds, and the sound of
drills grinding into stubborn teeth seldom ceases.

If you’re interested, however, in what a dentist has to
go through in order to care for your teeth, then stop by
some afternoon. Here you’ll ﬁnd the newest equipment and

‘the most up-to—date methods being taught

instructors that can be had.”

The Pitt Dental School came into existence on April
20, 1896 with 118 matriculants as the independent.Pittsburgh
Dental College. The ﬁrst class graduated from that school

in 1898.

ment of Western University of Pa. The first dental building
was dedicated in June of 1912, and is still in use today as
the classroom and labs for the ﬁrst—two-year students.

“It’s a long, tough grind, no pun intended,” one student.

said. He was referring to the seven years it takes to become.
a’ dentist. Students put their ﬁrst three years in at the;

,Cathedral, then transfer to the Dental School.

At the end of their first year at dent school, they are,
awarded a BS degree, and upon completion of their seven;
years they are graduated as Doctor of Dental Surgery. This}
seven year combined college-dentistry course was inaugur-g

ated in 1949. '

The embryo dentists are more than happy with their‘

schooling, but, like all college students, complain about the

Practice At Inﬁrmary

Besides their regular classroom and lab work, which
runs through the entire day with an hour for lunch, the stu-
dents have a chance to practice their trado at the dental in-:1
ﬁrmary and the Dental Department of Falk Clinic. Excep-
tionally able seniors work part of their ﬁnal year at homes,
asylums, and penal institutions.

The Pep Club idea is Sam's own
“baby,” which he is now pushing
all alone. He says it could form a
nucleus for pep rallies, demonstra-

tivate Pitt spirit. The club would
be an organization which could be

One ‘of the few non-IF-slate

and unnecessary situationi” Con-
cerning this he says “Men and

awards as junior worthy, Hall of

have tried the same tests and discovered the one
true test of cigarette mildness! I

It’: the sensible test . . . the 30-Day Camel
Mildness Test, which simply asks you to try
Camels as your steady smoke, on a day-after-day,

you’ve tried Camels for 30 days iii your “T-Zone”
