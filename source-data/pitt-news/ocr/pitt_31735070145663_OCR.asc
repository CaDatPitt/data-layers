Waiting

‘Day ‘N’

Night’ for tickets

Well, just during the day, but it was a really long line

Liz Navratil
News Editor

Carolann Howard stood in line for
almost two hours yesterday to get

' tickets for a Kid Cudi concert next

month.

Howard, a sophomore, said she
wasn’t sure why she waited so long
for the tickets.

She went to the N.E.R.D. con-

cert Pitt Program Council hosted .

last year. .

“It was boss,” she said. “We
had just lost the Sweet Sixteen
and N.E.R.D. said, ‘OK, we’re gonna
have some fun?”

The crowd was energetic, How-
ard said, so it got the students’
minds off the game.

The crowd in the William Pitt
Union yesterday was quite differ-
ent.

Students formed a line that
wrapped from the ticket sales desk
back toward the Kimbo Art Gallery,
turned the corner until it hit the
PPC office and then turned again,
stopping about 10 feet away from
the Kurtzman Ballroom.

The hundreds of students who
lined up throughout the day waited
for $5 tickets to the PPC—sponsored
Kid Cudi concert.

The concert will occur in the
Fitzgerald Field House at 8 p.m.
March 27.

Cudi, a hip—hop artist, is most
well-known for his song “Day ‘N’
Night.”

The students were fairly quiet.
Many did their homework or read
books while waiting.

SPORTS

Basketball
preview

In their second matchup with Seton Hall,
the Panthers are hoping to win this time.

Dennis Wilson, a sophomore,
passed the time by listening to his
iPod and doing “absolutely noth-
ing” else.

He got into line around 9 a.m.,
and by 10:45, he was about a dozen
people away from the ticket win-
dow.

Wilson said he skipped his game
theory class to buy ﬁve tickets.

“I thought I’d be able to walk up
[to the window],” he said. “I was
kind of pissed, but it’s all right. It’s
a sacriﬁce.”

Carolyn Reich, a receptionist

, for PPC, said the group was sur-

prised by the turnout.

Ticket sales tend to depend
upon which artist is performing,
but they tend to peak around 10

a.m., when a couple dozen people -

usually show up at the ticket office,
Reich said.

She said she thought the Kid
Cudi tickets sold quickly because
“he has one really big hit, and he’s
an up-and- coming artist.”

The council sold more than

T 1,o00.of the 1,400 tickets it could,

Reich said.

The remaining tickets are for
assigned seats, rather than the gen-
eral admission tickets that would
allow people to get closer to the
stage.

It will continue to sell tickets at
its ticket booth,
next to the infor-
mation desk in
the Union,
from 10
a.m. to 5
p.m. to-
day.

Oakland
shooting

Man shot three times
off of Semple Street

Liz Navratil
and Lindsay Carroll

A21—year—old manwas instable condi-
tion last night after being shot three
times during a robbery near Semple
Street.

Police received a callat 8:45 p.m.
saying there had been a shooting at
3464 St. James Place, an alley off of
Semple Street nearWard Street. Police
thinktwo meninski masks enteredthe
home and shot the man three times,
once in the chest, once inthe abdomen
and once in the neck, said Sgt. Brian
Elledge, a city police oﬁicer.

Medics took the man to UPMC
Presbyterian Hospital in Oakland. The
man arrived in critical condition and
was later downgraded to serious and
then again to stable condition.

Police recovered a gun atthe scene,
but the two men remained at large as
of press time. ‘

Chn'stopher.Kass, aPittjuniorwho
lives at the house next door to where
the shooting occurred, said he never
heard the gunshots.

Kass said he didn’t ﬁnd out about
the shooting until his friend called
him.

“[He] was like, ‘Hey, there was a
shooting next to your house,” Kass
said. V

Kass said he didn’t recall anything

‘ similar happening in the area before,

but it changed how he felt about living
inthe alley. ’ _ '

“It’s a little creepy now,” Kass said.

Elledge said the city’s robbery unit
will investigate the case.

He said anyone with infomiation
about the incident should call the city
police’s robbery division at (412) 323-
7151.

Trial not Pittsburgh’s style

Keep Sheikh Mohammed’s trial out of Pa. — we don’t need another G-20

 
 
  

Jacob Brown
Columnist

Just as Pittsburgh has ﬁnally cleared
its lungs of the remnants of OC gas
lingering in the court system follow-
ing last September’s G-20 Summit, it '
looks like P.T. Obama and his three-
ring political circus might be on its
way back for an encore.

Promisingto close the Guantana-
mo Bay military base during his ﬁrst
month in office, the president also
vowed to have the remaining 9/11
terrorism suspects, tried in civilian
courts. Because of Sixth Amendment
stipulations concerning the proxim-
ity of the trial venue_ to the crimes
committed, New York, Virginia and
Western Pennsylvania have made the
short list to host the trials. _

New York City would be the ob-
vious choice, but Mayor Michael
Bloomberg said he didn’t want the
trials of mastermind Khalid Sheikh
Mohammed and four other suspects

disrupting the already hectic New
York lifestyle. Bloomberg appar-
ently carries some clout, as Politico
reported that the White House is
heeding his request. .

And no one’s mentioning Vir-
ginia seriously — just a few miles
away from Washington D.C. and the
Pentagon.

Since Pittsburgh is the largest city

near where United 93 went down, we 0

might get stuck with the trial here.
If that happens, we know plenty of
protesters will be in town.

Obama’s 2010 budget has allo-
cated $200 million for the stateside
trials. For reference, the G-20 only
cost the government a little over $12
million for all accommodations dur-
ing the two=day summit and into the
weekend.

Just imagine what kind of military-
grade weapons some bored security
personnel could use on civilian by-
standers given that kind of budget. I
don’t know about any of you, buti can
hardly contain my excitement.

Surely, our gung—ho mayor must

be elated to have another opportunity
to showthe worldwhat Pittsburgh has
to offer, right? Well, not exactly.

Inwhat mightbe theﬁrst instance
I can remember, Mayor Ravenstahl
isn’t making himself out to be like a
teenage girl in a shoe store with dad’s
credit card. Dare I say it, but our young
mayor is showing some maturity and
restraint toward this occasion.

According to his spokeswoman,
Joanna Doven, during an interview
with the Tribune-Review, Ravenstahl
shares many of the same concerns as
Bloomberg. ‘

“The trial could put our citizens
in danger, as well as the exorbitant
costs associatedwith the trial, some-

‘thing that we could not withstan ,”

she said.

It’s possible that, contrary to our
concerns based on past handlings,
our representatives were paying at-
tention to us during the G-20 ﬁasco.
Even Sen. Arlen Specter doesn’t want
this state to host the trials, much less
Pittsburgh.

Letters to the editor

Dear Pitt News,

A lot has come out recently about the rumor of Pitt Athletics moving to the Big Ten conference. Although
this may seem like a major issue, the heart of the matter lies much deeper. The question to move to the Big
Ten is a choice between what type of school Pitt will become, a basketball or a football one. A move to the
Big Ten clearly shows the school’s wish to bring back the glories of football. Staying in the Big East will high-
light our extremely successful basketball team that has recently been the hallmark of Pitt Athletics. So the
question now lies with athletic director Steve Pederson. Do you want Pitt to become a football school like
Penn Statewhen we can’t even win what most consider one of the worst BCS conferences, or do we want to
become a basketball school like Duke in a sport that keeps getting better and better for Pitt? I know where
my allegiance lies. -

Dear Pitt students,

Iam sure you are all aware of West Virginia fans’ behavior at the last Pitt basketball game. In seeing that
behavior, I felt extremely upset and angry, as I am sure many of you were.

As an alumnus who greatly loves his alma mater and the respect she garners, I implore you, the students
and representatives of Pitt, not to behave as those West Virginia fans and students. ’

I am not telling you to cheer quietly, but I hope that you can be creative with your chants and not use
profanity or throw objects onto the court. You have a reputation as one of the best student sections in the
land, and I hope that continues. '

But please do not lower yourselves. 4

Not long ago, students rioted and destroyed parts of campus after the last Steelers Super Bowl victory,
and that behavior was awful and embarrassing. Let’s show everyone that we can move beyond those actions
and proceed with class and dignity.

Our Panthers need you, both men and women, so get out there and support them.

Hail to Pitt!

I Trendy patterns and multiple
personalities will rock the run-

Show.
This year’s theme, Alter Ego,
was inspired by Mississippi pho-

tographer Derek Blanks’ volume
of work.

His gallery showcases celebri-
ties, from singer Monica to come-
dian/TV personality Mo’Nique to
the cast of Bravo’s Real Housewives
of Atlanta, each with their own con-
trasting personas.

The BAS Fashion Show will take
ideas from Blanks’ photography
and incorporate them into a series
of scenes to make up the fashion
show.

To correspond with the theme,’

the scenes of the show are show-
cased in pairs.

1 director, Candice Rollinson, cre-
ated this concept.

BAS executive board appointed
Rollinson when the previous fash-

cause of “creative differences.”

When asked to step up as cre-
ative director, Rollinson had mixed
feelings. ‘

“I was ﬂattered, but I was also
nervous,” she said.

- Rollinson would have four
months to‘ put together a produc-
tion scheduled to take an entire
year to plan.

Despite the odds against her,
Rollinson accepted the challenge.

Since then, Rollinson, along
with technical director Shaina
Ramsey and a crew of three other
girls, came together to compose
a masterpiece in a short amount

of time. .

‘Crazy Heart’ director unveils muses

Scott Cooper, director of Oscar-nominated ‘Crazy Heart, "shares the inspirations that lead to a major motion picture

V ' MT Campus
“Crazy Heart” director Scott Cooper used his parents’ musical tastes as his inspiration.

Andy Tybout
Staﬁ"Writer

A word of advice for aspiring
directors: Don’t hesitate to let
your parents’ tastes inﬂuence

your work. _
Before directing the criti-

cally acclaimed “Crazy Heart,”
before acting his way through
Civil War epics and TV dramas,
Scott Cooper grew up listening
to his father’s country records
in the Blue Ridge mountains of
Virginia. A l .

“I literally cut my teeth at a
very young age listening to great
country musicians and also great
bluegrass musicians,” Cooper
said during a stop in Pittsburgh
Thursday. “All of those artistic
inﬂuences came to bear when it
was time to write and direct my
ﬁrst ﬁlm.”

Cooper always had an aes-
thetic in mind, but the road to
“Crazy Heart” was far from cer-
tain. Cooper had to hack his way

through countless acting gigs be-
fore landing himself in the direc-
tor’s chair.

“As an actor, I always found

myself being a bridesmaid to '

Matt Damon, Jude Law, Ethan
Hawke,” Cooper said. “I was al-
ways working but never doing the
stuff that was really fulﬁlling and
rewarding and personal.”

Tired of having his true tal-
entsmarginalized, Cooper said
he sought to combine two of his
major interests: Southern culture
and directing.

An adaptation of the 1987
novel by Thomas Cobb, “Crazy
Heart,” seemed to ﬁt the bill.

Of course, Cooper had help

I with the adaptation. Oscar-win-

ning actor and fellow Virginian
Robert Duvall, in addition to
playing a character in the film,
signed on as a producer.

“He was the patron saint to
this project. [The ﬁlm] could
never have happened if it wasn’t

' for Robert Duvall,” Cooper said.

“Anytime [Duvall’s] name is on a

Forward fashion Will bedeck models

Although the organizationpprocess faced setbacks, the production details and team of models pulled together right in time "'"

the ﬁnale open ended. A
This will allow the audience

members to raisequestions about

themselves — questions they

wouldn’t have asked before hav-

ing viewed the fashion show.

BAS Presidentjahmaiah Lewis
is proud of what the show has be-
come.

“The fashion show is one of our

crucial programs because students '

really look forward to it every year,
and they support us in huge num-
bers,” she said.

Lewis didn’t want to disappoint
her fellow students this year.

Through the setbacks and stum-
bles, Rollinson, her committee and
her team of models pulled through
just in time.

“[BAS] has put together a great
production,” -Lewis said. '

She guaranteed that everyone’s
hard work will certainly pay off on
Saturday night.

The fashion show doesn’t fea-
ture a designer this year.

Instead, the 45 or so models will
wear the latest trends from fash-
ion forward stores, a few Vintage
pieces and styles from a featured
boutique._

1 “They will also be wearing a

few of their own pieces to add a

personal twist to the looks,” Lewis

said. ’
Rollinson, a senior pharmacy

major, said that fashion is “just a .

hobby.”

The leadership and communi-
cation skills she’s learned in the
process are the biggest things
she’ll take away from organizing
this fashion show.

“I accepted [my position as cre-
ative director] because I belietfed
that I could do the job effectively,”
Rollinson said.

She is thankﬁil to the BAS execu-
tive board, her fellow committee
members and the models for their
hard work and effort.

“In true BAS fashion, we all
pulled together to work it out,”
she said.

“I think he liked my approach to the
craft,” Cooper said. “We shared sensibili-
ties. We shared likes with ﬁlms and actors
and sports and literature.”

Cooper, Duvall and the rest of the cast
have crafted the underdog hit of the year
together. .

“Crazy Heart” is the story of Bad Blake
(Jeff Bridges, who won a Golden Globe for
the performance and was nominated for
an Oscar), a washed-up country singer
who spends more time drinking than he
does writing music.

His typical venue is a bowling alley or
small bar, and his protégé, Tommy Sweet

(Colin Farrell), has totally eclipsed him
in popularity. l

But when he meets” journalist Jean
Craddock (Maggie Gyllenhaal, also nomi-

nated for an Oscar), he breaks from his

funk, bonding with her _son and writ-

ing new songs. The question is, will the
change last? .

“I always wanted this ﬁlm to evoke th A

19705, whichwere the great ﬁlms, in my
' opinion,” Cooper said. “All those ﬁlms
were about character and behavior and
not so much plot.”
A ﬁlm like “Crazy Heart” wouldn’t be
much without music. ,
Thankfully,-Cooper was able to enlist
a host of talent for the score, including
musician-producer T—Bone Burnett and
singer—songwriter Ryan Bingham —— musi-
cians who epitomize the antihero image
of country music. . *
“What attracted me to that kind of mu~
sic were guys who ‘always wrote about
their life experiences,” Cooper said.
“They lived on the edge, and they were
iconoclasts. They were rebellious, anti-
establishment, and I found that to be more
interesting cinematically.”
Cooper’s approach to ﬁlmmaking is
one of wholesome storytelling.

Regarding the messages he hoped ail? -
» diences will take from the movie, Coopiir

said, “That we’re all ﬂawed and that we’re
never too old for second, third and fourth
chances and that we can overcome and
experience fully _all of [the] themes that
course through the movie, which are 10$) ,

‘hope, regret, redemption.” 4

East season with an undefeated
ﬁve-game eruption. The team fol-
lowed up that performance with a

tremendous swoon, dropping four
out of its last ﬁve contests.

Now, Pitt (16—6, 6-4 Big East)
attempts to get back on track this
Saturday at home against Seton
Hall (12—8, 3-6 Big East), which
handed Pitt its second Big East
defeat less than two weeks ago.

Pitt has been struggling might-
ily on the offensive end of the ﬂoor.
The Panthers never managed to

gain a lead in either of their last two
losses to West Virginia and South
Florida.

Eighty minutes of game action
have passed since the Panthers
were in a winning position against
St. John’s.

In their last four losses, the Pan-
thers have a combined 39 percent
ﬁeld goal percentage, accompanied
by a 24 percent success rate from

3-point range. In comparison, the
Panthers had a 45 percent ﬁeld
goal percentage and a 44 percent
3-point percentage during their
ﬁrst ﬁve Big East victories.

One factor contributing to the
decline of the Pitt offense is Ashton
Gibbs’ current cold streak. Enter-
ing the Georgetown game on Jan.
20, Gibbs averaged 17.5 points per
game and made 43 percent of his

ANALYSIS ""'

These
aren’t my-
Panthers

Players don’t perform

Randy Lieberman
Senior Staﬁ' Writer

This is not the Pitt basketball
are used to seeing.

Whiifed rebounds, uncontested
shots on defense and maddeningly
inconsistent scoring are inexcus-
able mistakes from the Panthers.

A70-51 shellacking Wednesday
night against West Virginia, no mat-
ter how close the game was in the
second half, is still an unacceptable
19-point loss.

“They playedharder than us,
that’s why they won the game,”
guard Jermaine Dixon said aftgr
the game.

The Panthers were out-worked,
lacked hustle throughout the game
and folded from competition when

the game mattered most. West
Virginia scored 20 second-chance
points off of 19 offensive rebounds
and won the rebounding battle 45-
31. ’

“They deserved to win,” coach
Jamie Dixon said. “[The score was]
43-41 and it seemed like we didn’t
get a rebound after that, and thatés
where we got bea .”

As exaggerated as that sounds,
Dixon has a point. Pitt grabbed six
more rebounds after freshmanJ.J.
Richardson’s tip-in brought the
Panthers within two points at the
12:50 mark in the second half. if

The problem was, it took Pitt
ﬁve-and-a-half minutes to get
another one, and West Virginia
grabbed 22 rebounds the rest of
the way. '

Through the past four losses ima
brutal ﬁve-game span -— Pitt’s worst
since 2001 — Pitt has plummeted
from a resilient, tough-minded team
to a lackadaisical, mediocre squad
relying on jump-shooting and poor
rebounding to ‘erase early deﬁcits,

That’s not good enough. That’s

attempted 3-pointers.

Since that point Gibbs has gone
6-29 from beyond the arc, or 21
percent.

“*3” However, all of the attention
shouldn’t fall on Gibbs alone. Ju-
niors Brad Wanamaker and Gilbert
Brown failed to score a single point
against backyard rival West Vir—
ginia on Wednesday night.

Before being blanked against
the Mountaineers, Wanamaker and
Brown were averaging 12.9 and 11.2
points per game, respectively.

One positive that can be taken
from the 19-point, projectiles—on-
the-court beating that West Vir-

tygihia handed Pitt, is the play of
true freshman_].J. Richardson. The
6-foot—7 Richardson had a career
night while spelling Gary McGhee
at center. A

Richardson was averaging less
than one point and one rebound
per game this season before he
scored seven points and grabbed
four boards against the Mountain-
eers on Wednesday. -~'

averaging 11.2 rebounds a game.
Pope played 38 minutes and made
up for the absence of Seton Hall’s
leading scorer, Jeremy Hazell, who
sat out most of the game with foul
trouble.

If Hazell can stay on the court,
he is a force the Panthers must
stop if they want to win. The ju-
nior guard is second in the Big East,
averaging 23 points per game, and
is coming off of a 32-point perfor-
mance against Villanova.

Despite Gibbs’ problems shoot-
ing from the outside, he was the
Panthers’ leading scorer against
Seton Hall. The sophomore guard
contributed 23 points, 14 of which
came from free throws.

With more tough contests loom-
ing on the horizon, it becomes vital
for the Panthers to defend their
home court while improving their
NCAA Tournament resumé.

One more slipup on Saturday
and Pitt fans will be reaching for
the panic button, which is some-
thing tha_t_seemed farfetched just
ﬁve games ago.

Pitt’s play is unrecognizableafter WVU game

Lieberman < 13

I not Pitt basketball. Despite how this

hopeful season started, it might be

I a rebuilding season after all. Those
V “N.I.T” chants at the end of the
,5 game from the West Virginia-faith-
 ful might become a haunting reality
3 with each disappointing loss.

 sj; Jamie Dixon is always quick to
 i)lame his own inadequate coach-
 :, gforaloss. .

  “We’ve got to execute better.
  ve got to do a better job and take
Vj iesponsibilities for our failure,”
  ixon said.

  
 

But that’s not good enough ei-

  er. It’s all about rebounding. , _

“They simply killed us on the

 defensive end, and that started with
 offensive rebounding,” sophomore
 Ashton Gibbs said. “I think that
 was the real key to the game, the
 rebounding aspect of it.”

“I don’t know if we had effort in

  ﬁrst half and not in the second
 half,” Dixon said. “They’re a good

’ offensive rebounding team, we’re a

T pretty good rebounding team. But

we haven’t done it two games in a
row so that’s a concern. We need to
block out better, we need to ﬁnish

plays better.”

But there’s much more working
against the Panthers through their
struggles.

In fact, right now I could blame
most of the team, individually, as to
why the Panthers are sputtering.

Don’t think so? Watch me. i

Nasir Robinson, will you ever
make a free throw? I could pull a
random Oakland Zoo member out
of the crowd to shoot your free
throws during a game, and Pitt
would be better off than the dismal
37.5 percent mark you put up.

Gary McGhee, boy Pitt fans
could go on and on about your play
Wednesday night. I’ll stick to Jer-
maine Dixon’s comment after the
game, which couldn’t be more true
in your case: “Height has nothing
to do with rebounding. I think it’s
effort. If you box them out and drive
them out, then they’re not going to
get that rebound.” ,

It’s apparent that your 6—foot-
10 height isn’t an advantage in re-
bounding, so boxing out would be
where I’d start. -

Another tip, the box on the

backboard is a nice place to aim a
layup. c

Travon Woodall, you’re the sec-
ond most frustrating player to watch
next to McGhee. With the God-given
quickness you have, sometimes you
show ﬂashes of brilliance, but other
times there are head—scratching
gaffes. One day, Pitt will need a true

minute and a half. It says something
about your lack of defense when
little—used ].]. Richardson has to
play signiﬁcant minutes.

Gilbert Brown, another model of
inconsistency. Your point totals in
the last ﬁve games: 20, seven, nine,
25 and zero.

Brad Wanamaker, zero points

your job to lose.

Dante Taylor, the team suffered
most with you at center. Pitt bas-
ketball clicks with a presence in the
paint on the offensive and defensive
side, and you provided neither. You
made West Virginia freshman Deniz

on the night is tough, but so are two
travels and allowing Devin Ebanks
to have his way with you in the ﬁrst
half. Pitt desperately needs you to

team also needs leadership.]udging

L A by how Pitt immediately responded

to the McGhee-Robinson referee
tripping and technical foul incident
Wednesday night, allowing a 12-4

*1!“

WVU run until a timeout late in
the game, this team lacks proper
leadership.

Ashton Gibbs, simply put, 2-13
shooting won’t get it done.

Jermaine Dixon, ﬁnally some:
one to praise. Even after missing a
game with an ankle injury, you often
looked like the best player on the
court Wednesday night.

Each of these players’ struggles

- add up to one thing: a must-win

game on Saturday against Seton
Hall, even if the Panthers don’t
believe it. ' .

“Deﬁnitely not, deﬁnitely not a
must-win, it’s just another game,”
Jermaine Dixon said.

But just think, if the Panthers.»
lose Saturday, they could fall to
eighth place in the conference
with a 6-5 in-conference record.
Remaining on Pitt’s schedule are
games against West Virginia, at
Marquette, Villanova and at Notre
Dame.

The Panthers need to get back to
what we are all used to seeing from
them. If they can’t, time might run
out on the season.
