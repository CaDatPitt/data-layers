a pleasant one and I regret leaving

Cf Democracies in Recent llriisis

Dr. Papanek Condernns 

1:  ::.= Eu-I 

By Razlph Kallock

Charging Czechoslovakia’s demo-
cratic allies, France and Great Brit-
am, with responsibility for the pres-
ent central European situation, Dr.
Jan Papanek, Czechoslovakian con-
sul, declared that “war” already ex-
isted, in an address before members
of John Marshall, honorary pre-legal
fraternity.

After the present conflict is over,
the world will realize the position
of Czechoslovakia in central Eu-
rope, and that the center must be
governed by a state not dominated
by the great powers. “Until that
fact is realized, there will be no
peace in Europe. There will be great
boundary changes, but the principles
of small free states will have to be

-expressed in some way.”

Concerning the fate of his own
country, Dr. Papanek pointed out
that Czechoslovakia was ready for
every eventuality but one—ultima-
tum from her allies. Without con-
sulting the Czechs, France and Great
Britain gave up valuable fortresses

to Germany. Instead of openly re-
volting as Germany had wished, the
Czech people acquiesced silently to
German demands, and gave up all.

“It was like sticking up a bank,”
declared Dr. Papanek. We had twice
as much gold reserve as Germany.
They needed it to buy raw materials
and they took it.” He prophesied
a similar fate for Poland and Hun-

A
V

gary within the next six months.

The democratic states did not
unite to stop the Czechicrisis, fail-
mg once again as in the Spanish,
Manchurian, and Ethiopian I affairs.
Consequently, says Dr. Papanek, they
are the underdogs.’ Six monthsago
they could have preventedlthe latest
atrocities. Now they cannot be stop-
ped without the aid of the ‘United
States, or Russia, who is unwilling
to go into the bargain.

The fact that Germany has seized
the gold reserve and the Skoda and
other munitions plants will be of no
material assistance if other countries
will cooperate and refuse to sell
Germany raw materials, without
which the factories are crippled, Dr.
Papanek asserted.

The final outcome of the present
situation will see the German ide-
ology failing, according to Dr. Pap-
anek, because it is not based on mor-
al values. As in the World War,
Germany’s ambitions are for expan-
sion eastward. It will be impossible
to maintain the present pace for the
German people are suffering eco-
nomic ills just the same as the rest
of the world’s, and resistance will

come sooner or later.

Europe, however, is not ready for
democracy. It will take many gen-
erations to destroy the nationalistic
character of the densely populated
states.

0n the Resignation
Of a ‘Y’ Secretary

T DOESN’T seem possible that Bill Mendenhall

has resigned.

It was early in our freshman year when we ﬁrst
met the University “Y” secretary and learned that
he would rather be called Bill than Mr. Menden-
hall. And since then, he has seemed to us a ﬁxture
at Pitt, just like the Cathedral elevators, and the
chimes that mark oﬁ class hours.

To many other people, we think, Bill Mendenhall
was also a ﬁxture, in another sense. They knew
he was around, but, because he did all his many
jobs so unobtrusively and behind the scenes, they
weren’t too aware of his presence.

But these same people, no doubt, are aware of the
things that Bill has done at the University. They
eat in the eighth ﬂoor tuck shop, which was begun
as a “Y” project some years ago, and has since been
taken over by the Dean of Men’s office. They at-
tend Freshman Camp, originated under “Y” aus-
pices, since taken over by the Dean of Men’s of-
ﬁces.

They have been going to the weekly sessions of
Inquiry Forum, which originated as a. YM-YVV
project and still remains under the same jurisdic-
tion, serving as a medium by which discussion of
problems of the day, not undertaken by any other
University group, may be engaged in by students.
And they have been fairly bombarded with pub-
licity about religious emphasis weeks, besides at-
tending Community Forum occasionally, probably
without the knowledge that he was helping to ar-
range the programs.

But we know Bill would be too modest to own up
to these things. He would rather talk about his
own successor and the future of the organization
which he has so carefully brought along.

That’ also is important. For tlie experience of
the University Y has proven that if the organization
is to continue as an important inﬂuence in Univer-
sity life, it must continue in its present semi-auton-
omous state, under the direction of a capable leader
who will receive the moral and ﬁnancial support of
the University, but who will, in other respects be
an independent director of a reasonably inde-
pendent activity.

Bill Mcndenhall, as do most educators and ad-
ministrators, evidently realizes the importance of
a fundamental concept in the operation of a Uni-
versity——that, although resignations are sometimes
unavoidable, it is imperative that the vacancies
created by such actions be ﬁlled by equally capable
men.

We Do Not
View With Alarm

ACCORDING to today’s poll 'by the Student

Opinion Surveys of America, the majority of
American college students would prefer commun-
ism to fascism if they were forced to make a choice.

To some of our super-super patriotic organiza-
tions, and Congressman Martin Dies, this informa-
tion is probably shocking. To them, it will be doc-
umentary proof that our colleges are hotbeds of
radicalism, that subversive elements, ﬁnanced by
“Moscow gold” are at work on America’s cam-
puses.

To us, it indicates nothing of the sort. We
neither view with alarm nor even bother to raise
our eyebrows in polite surprise.

For we see it as a quite natural reaction. The
students, by means of a very uncomfortable ques-
tion, were merely forced to choose the lesser of two
evils, and they did.

A majority of them, were not, evidently, taken
in by the old dodge which pushed Hitler, Mussolini,
and Franco into power, that of saving civilization
from communism with a. lily-white fascism.

The very fact that almost 44 per cent of those
voting favored fascism seems to us proof enough
that we need not harbor any fear about the “red”
tendency of the collective American student body.

As a sidelight, we were interested to note that
the greatest percentage in favor of communism was
recorded in the South, that traditional stronghold
of conservatism. That. may be due to the close-
rangc observation by southern students of the vari-
ous fziscistic and vigilante movements which have
their roots on the Old South. At the same time, it
may be an indication of 3. growing liberalism on
the part if a southern intellectual minority which
is gi'a(luz1ll_v inﬂuencing thought below the Mason-
Dixon line.

But we 1'epc-at that he poll results don ’t— change
one hit our opinion that the majority of college
students are inti'insicall_v conservative. The poll
revea.ls that inany stuclcnts didn’t know the diﬁen
ence betweeii communism and fascism. Maybe it
would be closer to tile truth to say that tliey (lidn”r.
céire.

The Signiﬁcance
0f Another Boom

T IS really a sign of mutual cooperation and un-
derstanding when three peoples like the Ser-
bians, Slovenians, and Croatians can unite to create
a. living memorial to their common culture and
heritage.

\Vhen every effort is being made by totalitarian
regimes to divide these nationalties, to destroy their
independence, it is pa.rt‘icula.rly signiﬁcant that, in
the true spirit of intellectual tolerance and good
will, a classroom dedicated to these people, and ﬁ-
nanced by the local Yugoslavs, should be dedicated
as part of the University tonight.

We feel certain, that, as has been the case with
the Czechoslovak room, the new Yugoslav room
will symbolize and preserve the character and tra-
ditions of the culture it represents no matter what
may happen on the troubled interna.tional horizon.

The Greeks
Had a Word

i  lastic ratings, we noticed that the women have
again come through with an all-fraternity average

that makes the men ’s fraternal groups look slightly .

unscholarly in comparison. Apparently this is not
just a coincidence, since it has happened not once
but several times.

\Ve hesitate to give any reason for this, and we
don ’t know to what the women attribute their suc-
cess in piling up such a “quantity” of quality
points, but we do think that perhaps the men might
say “Yes, but not many fraternity women live in
their fraternity houses.” Then we can hear the
women coming back with “Oh, so you can’t get
anything done in your houses.”

All we can say is, were the ancient Greeks right?
Minerva was a lady.

Pittsburgh Attorney
Praises ‘Edito1°’s Biary’
Editor, The Pitt News

I have just read a copy of your editorial in the issue
of March 24, on the permanent signiﬁcance of the Czech-
oslovak Room in the Cathedral of Learning and I am
so impressed with the grasp of fundamentals which the
editorial shows, that I must express my appreciation in
this way.

You have lifted an incident which, in the hurly-burly
of Pittsburgh’s life could have been overlooked, into its
proper perspective so that a brave people’s aims and
aspirations can be seen, by all who are willing really to
look. Our newspapers too often, it seems to me, com-
ment only on the hard facts of a situation. They state
in cold prose that the Czechoslovak Room was dedicated
on March 7, before ﬁfteen hundred people, and their
job is done. But the dedication of that Room, on
March 7, meant more and you have captured that
“more” in a very beautiful and, I believe, permanent
way.

The Czechoslovakia that was—and I believe will be
again——represented in a magniﬁcent way the struggle
of the human spirit for freedom. The fact that that
struggle was successful in the midst of a sea of auto-
crats made that success even greater. The further fact
that as a result of that success, great spiritual leader-
ship such as that represented by Hus and Masaryk and
Benes was gloriﬁed, only adds to the greatness of the
achievement. And I am glad that you got what Jan
Masaryk meant when he said that here in Pittsburgh,
in a safe corner of the Cathderal, the ideals of Czech-
oslovakia will be preserved for all time. If the future
students have the ability to look with your eyes, they
will ﬁnd in this little Room representing a Republic
which today is, perhaps, only a name, a source of
strength and inspiration. It will make them more truly
scholars and it will help make them more truly genuine
Americans of the kind that should build the democracy
of our future.

I congratulate you upon the ﬁne job and I con-
gratulate the University as well.

Sincerely yours,
EDWARD O. TABOR.

 By Student Opinion Surveys of %

 they had to decide between that i were variations. as seen below:

7system and fascism. This trend has
Ebeen revealed by the latest nation-
fwide poll of the STUDENT OPINION
,'sURvEYs or AMERICA.

3 Within the last two decades fascism
land communism have come into the
lfront in the news as a result of the
Iset-ups in operation in Russia, Ger-
,-many, and Italy. During that period
jof time today’s college youth has been
 growing up.

Because of the directly opposite
lpolicies of the two forms of govern-
‘ment, in theory at least, speculation
ias to which is better has developed,
{especially in halls of learning. Fre-
quently asked is the question, “If
you had to make a choice, which
lwould you prefer, fascism or com-
munism?” When this hypothetical
,question was put before the nation’s
college students, representing in the
SURVEYS’ cross-section every creed,
race, and political aﬁiliation, the re-
sults were:

Communism

Fascism

. . . . ..56.4 per cent
. . . . . . . . ..43.6.per cent

When the same question was asked
to the entire nation a little more than
a year ago by the American Institute
of Public Opinion, exactly opposite
results were shown. Then 57 per
cent of the voters favored fascism.
Therefore, either college students
differ with their elders, or recent
events in Europe have changed their
opinions. Accurate comparisons are
not possible since no national _col1egi-
ate poll had been taken regularly un-

Heinz Chapel
‘Lovely’, Says
Barzilian Star

By Freda Jaffe

Although Bidu Sayao, in an inter-
view before her concert last Tuesday,
said she was “so beezy” that she had
little time for sports, dancing or even
practice, she evidently scans the
magazines. For while touring the
Cathedral, she turned to her mother
and mentioned “Life,” the only Eng-
lish word in her rapid speech.

Miss Sayao explained (in English
this time) just how busy she is.
Pushing back the veil of the tiny hat
which was perched on her auburn
Waves, she said‘ that she sings some
forty concerts a year. In Winter she
appears in Europe and the United
States, in summer in South America.

The young Brazilian soprano will
sing at the Metropolitan next week
and then will leave for a recital in
Canada, which is “far away and
cold.” Then her deep brown eyes
widened, and drawing her mink coat
closer about her trim ﬁgure, she mur-
mured, “It’s cold in Pittsburgh.”

This was Miss Sayao’s ﬁrst appear-
ance in the city and the ﬁrst time
that she has shared the recital spot-
light with Martini, although she has
sung with him in several operas.

The petite coloratura star studied

and sang for ten years before she
made her debut in the United States
three years ago with Toscanini in
Town Hall.

Asked if she were married, Miss
Sayao shrugged her shoulders in a
negative gesture and smiling impish-
ly, added, “Not yet.”

The star kept repeating the word
lovely as she walked through the
Heinz Chapel. The Commons Room
itself reminded the soprano of the
cathedral at Milan.

The lunch time crowd in the Com-
mons Room surprised her, -not be-
cause of the noise but because there
are both men and women at the Uni-
versity. In Brazil they don’t have
the word equivalent to coed, it seems.

We said goodby, wishing that we
had taken Spanish instead of French
in college, and Watched the star, her
manager, and her mother "leave the
Cathedral to visit the “commercial
center” of Pittsburgh.

Icers, 3-2;

Artz Gets Suspension

BULLETIN: Irvin Artz, wing

on the Pitt hockey team, has been

suspended by officials of the Ohio-Pennsylvania C01legiate Hockey
League and by the University of Pittsburgh Department of Athletics
for the duration of the season because of his conduct Wednesday even-
ing during the Pitt-John Carroll game, according f0 James Hagan. Di-

rector of Athletics.

By Bill McElwain __
A little discouraged but still determined to take the league cham-
pionship, the Panther puckmen were ready to skate against John Car-
roll this evening at Duquesne Garden in tht second of the Ohio-Penn-

sylvania title playoffs.

Nothing less than a victory over the C‘-levelanders will fulﬁll the
requirements, for the 3-2 defeat handed to the Cathedral six at Cleve-

land on Wednesday put Pitt in the’
spot of having to win tonight to’

Nobody seemed to know who was

deadlock the series and tomorrowlifighting Wh0m f0I‘ a few Seconds,

night to gain the league cup.

The job may be made more dif-
ficult if the Pitt casualty list from
the Wednesday clash is not de-
creased considerably by face off
time. Tatey Brittain seems the most
likely candidate for bench duty be-
cause of a badly bruised leg, in-
jured when he crashed against the
boards.

Carroll’s victory was a sour one,
despite the fact y’ 4 ./
that the final -, ‘
score was not
made until after
nearly seven min-
utes of the third
overtime. Any
good impressions
which might have
been made on the
fans earlier in the
b a t tle w e r e
wiped out by a
back alley riot
which occurred
just before the
winning goal.

Goalie Paddy Ryan of the Blue
Streaks stopped a Pitt shot out of
the crease in the sixth minute of
the final session, and when Bob
Schooley attempted to push both the
net minder and the puck into the
cage, Carroll’s Zemba took matters

:-

into his own fists.

but Ozzie Artz, who had already
served a five minute misconduct
penalty, slugged Zemba with his
stick, and in 15 seconds the ice was

spectators, all swinging fists or
clubs.

When the brawl was finally stop-
ped, Artz and Zemba were given
match penalties, and Vic Williams
went to the box to serve a major for
an unidentiﬁed Pitt battler. Left
with three men to four, the Panthers
wilted, Arsenault skating in from
the right side to beat Ellis at 6:46.

Carroll was by far the superior»
team in the ﬁrst two frames. Mey- 5

ers put Carroll ahead after only 1:39
of the game, batting in the rebound
after Ellis saved on his knee high
shot.

Fred Rancourt made it 2-0 at 3:26
of the second session with a whist-
ler into the right corner of the net,
but from then on, Ellis stopped all
attempts, most of them difficult
saves.

Schildecker scored twice in the
third period as Pitt reversed form
entirely. Lenny Broido passed to
Bill at the Carroll blue line and an
accurate shot escaped Ryan at 3:22.
Shortly after, at 4:55, Brittain set
up a score in front of the cage and
“Schi1” flipped it in.

Phi Delis and Delis
Lead Mushhall League

By Bert Jaffe

Phi Delta Theta and Delta Dan

Delta captured their third straight

mushball game ’l'uesda_v, knocking Sigma Alpha Mn and Pi Kappa
Alpha from the ranks of the undefeated.

Sigma Alpha Epsilon also received its initial taste of defeat be-
ing swamped nnder by Phi Epsilon Pi, 1-LL-4. Don Ceferratti and Joe
Cambal both were hit frequeiitljr while Marty Kramer. on the mound

for the Phi Eps, was effective‘
throughout the game.

Jay Silverberg led the Phi Ep at-
tack, banging out three hits, one a
triple, and crossing the platter the
same number of times.

Sigma Alpha Mu’s nine found itself
without the services of its ace pitcher,
Lou Mendlow, and went down to a
9-1 defeat, administered by Phi Delta
Theta. Bob Dannies twirled for the
winners.

“Bernie” Cashdollar led the Phi
Delt assault on pitcher Hurwitz with
three safe hits, including a homer,
double, and sin- ‘
gle. The winners
scored two in the
third, three in the
ﬁfth, and three—i-n
the sixth.

“Red” Krunkel-
ton pitched Delta
Tau Delta to a 9-7
win over Pi Kappa
Alpha. Ray Light
was striving for
his third succes-
sive victory for
the losers, but two
home runs by
Benghouser and Daddio
four hits off Harry Holt’s bat resulted
in a win for the Delt’s.

Bill Daddio celebrated his appoint-
ment to Pitt’s coaching staff at the
expense of Sigma Chi when he polled
two home runs, each coming with
two men on base to lead Theta Chi
in its first triumph,

Phi Kappa batted ﬁve runs across
the plate in its opening inning against
Doug Smith and the Phi Gams to tri-
umph, 9-5. Joe Connell connected
for two home runs, and Jack Glenn
batted out another to pace the win-
ners along with Dick Cassiano’s three
safe swats.

Kappa Sigma snapped out of its
slump and defeated Lambda Chi Al-
pha, 9-3.

'pitching—starts this afternoon. About

25 teams, including all 13 fraternities,
are entered in the three leagues. The
round-robin tgurnaments will be run

New Pitt Football Coaching Staﬁ Takes

Over Potentially Strong Linc, Backﬁeld

By Bill Mazefsky V‘

Yesterday afternoon Pitt start-
ed Spring football training and
head coach “(‘11isel" Bowser and
his staff of six aides started to ﬁt
together the eleven cogs that will

make up the 1939 Panther foot-
ball machine.

Unable to start until Bowser se-
lected his football cabinet, Spring
training opened about ten days late.
Mike Nicksick, Nick Klisky, Dr. Ar-
nold Greene, Bob Hoel, A1 Lezouski,
and Bill Daddio, all former Panther
stars, will round out the Pitt coach-
ing staff.

The new football regime takes
over a squad replete with good ma-
terial. From last year’s varsity hold-
overs and from the brilliant fresh-
man squad Bowser ought to ﬁnd
enough man power to keep this
year’s football varsity “among the
football powers.”

35 Report F or

Tennis Practice

If the quantity of tennis candidates
could be taken as an indication of a
strong team, then the Panthers should
have a great year, for more than
thirty-five would-be varsity and
freshman prospects reported for their
ﬁrst practice session this week.

Among those seeking varsity berths
are: William Bonnett, James Clark,
Paul Brinker, Joe Sheriﬁ, Robert
Ferris, Sam Barone, Charles Hergen-
roder, Edward DeEmilio, Carl Pesso-
laano, Knox Bassett, Ed Thompson,
Tim Raker, John Crosby, Alvin Lud-
wig, Alan Barry, Fred Larimore,
Robert Burns, Ephriam Werner,
Don Smith, Carl Kaufman, Joe Kris-
tufek, Adrian Hartman, Byron Mc-
Laughlin, Larry Smith, Ray Light,
Bob Lewis, Joe McCormick, and Joy
Hartman.

Forming a nucleus for a good
freshman team are such stars as Ar-
thur Hurwitz, Robert Nickeson,
Stanley Ungar, Jay Silverberg, and
Paul Ruskin. Other ﬁrst—year men
trying for positions are: Dick Quig-
ley, Frank Robinson, Bernard Feld-
man, James Yount, Paul Becker,
John Hughes, Ed Burton, and Al
Norbut.

Practice sessions will continue to
be held on the Trees Gym Basketball
ﬂoor every Tuesday and Thursday
afternoon from 3 to 4 o’clock until
the outdoor courts are in condition
for play.

The line shapes
up as another
P i t t stonewall.

Last year as a

sophomore Joe
Rettinger proved
himself a great
end. This year
he will carry on
at one of the
ﬂanks with Jack
Goodridge or Earl
Pressel at the
other end.

post with Frank

Rettinger proved himself a great end.
This year he will carry on at one of
the flanks with Jack Goodridge or
Earl Pressel at the other end.

Ted Konetsky, regular tackle, will
be at his old post with Frank Kris-

 

Kristufek or Bud Hafer on the other
side. The center of the line has pos-
sibilities of developing into another
great trio, similar to the Shotwcll,
Ormiston, Hartwig combine of a few
season’s ago. _

Dick Fullerton, at center, may turn
out to be the “big name” in the line.
Butch Klein has the makings of an-

other in the long line of All.-Ameri-~

can Pitt guards, and Rudy Gradisek,
his running mate, is just a step be-
hind. Traffic through the cente; of
the line ought to be very slow this
coming season.

Dreamer Dick Cassiano is all that

remains from last year’s All-Amer_i-
can backfield. He will cross goal
lines from his familiar left half 
sition. Ben Kish will probably be
in the signal calling position.

Three candidates are in line for
right half, Bonelli, Naric, and Thur-
bon.

EBB Conduct
'Poll of Students
110 News’ Content

Activities of the newly organized
Collegiate Bureau of Research will
begin Monday when members in-
stitute a campus poll concerning
the news and editorial content of
The News, according
Rothman, C41‘, director.

Ballots for the poll will be dis-
tributed in classes and “will only
take about two minutes to ﬁll out,”
says Rothman. This will be the
ﬁrst of the polls about the Uni-
versity which will be conducted
bi-weekly.

Rothman estimates that the poll
will contact at least 5,000 students
and will prove a deﬁnite cross sec-
tion of the student body. Readers
will be given a chance to criticize
The News and state their journal-
istic preferences for type of ar-
ticles printed.

A meeting of all students inter-
ested in joining the research staff
will be held at 2:30 o’clock today
in 815 Cathedral. Robert X. Gra-
ham, director of the University

movement have far more signiﬁ-
cance than it has at present. I
shall have completed my ninth
year and, in this time, our Asso-
ciation has made some progress,
but it is as nothing compared to
what the future holds, granted the
right leadership with the proper
moral and ﬁnancial support.

“My eagerness to take up the
new work at Cornell University
will not make it any easier to
leave my many friends in Pitts-
burgh. I can’t hope ever to ﬁnd a
ﬁner group of faculty and students
with which to work than we have
here. There is no reason for my
leaving except the conviction that
about every so often a man must
transplant himself ino new‘ tasks
and relationships. If he doesn’t do
so, he will get into a rut which
will be bad for himself and the
organization he tries to serve.

“Cornell University presents a
situation which will demand all I
have and then some. Cornell has
been pioneering in a form of or-
ganization which unites without
rcgimentation or control the per-
sonnel and resources of faculty and
student interests and the organized
church group—Ca'thclic, Protestant.
and Jewish. We shall have 2. staff
of eleven lull-time workers, and to
be Director of this very able group
is a. great opportunity.”

Mr. Mendenhall came to the Uni-
veisity in 1930 from Indiana where
he had been traveling student secre-i
tary of the Indiana State YMCA.l
During his stay here he took an ac-
tive part in the Community Forum,
adult education program, and other
sociological work.

As executive secretary of the
YMCA he was responsible for estab-
lishment of the freshman clubs,

Ifreshman camp, Religious Emphasis

Week, Inquiry Forum, vocational
groups, and the Institute on Public’

Affai: s. He also promoted int_er-fra-
ternity religious and social fellow-_
ship. ‘
* Upon :his' graduation from the

1‘-Iortii Dakota Agricultural college in
1916, Mr. 'l\/lendenhall accepted an
invitation from "the British Army
YMCA to serve with British troops
in the north-west frontier of India.
Ie stayed in India for a year and a
half and then served in Mesopotamia
i’o.:‘ six months.
He studied at Divinity School, Uni-
versity of Chicago, and he received
his M;=.sLcr’s degree in 1930.

Dr. Daugherty is serving as advisor

attended yesterday’s meeting.

Besides these notables, the conven-

from President Roosevelt, a member

ROTC Students
Witness Drills

The reason for all the army trucks
and soldiers on campus is not prepa-
ration for a war, but external evi-
dence of the presence of an army
unit to instruct the ROTC in the use
of anti-aircraft instruments of the
latest types.

First Lieutenant Henry P. Van
Ormer, of the 52nd Coast Artillery,
stationed at Fort Monroe, Virginia,
is here with 14 pieces of equipment,
making up a defensive unit used to
repel attacks by enemy aircraft.

Equipment used in the demonstra-
tion is the ﬁnest and latest in the
United States. It includes one 3-
inch anti-aircraft gun of the latest
model, two .50 caliber machine guns,
a director of the very latest type
