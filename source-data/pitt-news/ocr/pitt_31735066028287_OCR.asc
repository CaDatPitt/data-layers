Deal leaves Pill shorichungecl

By Anthony Breznican
Staff Writer

 

Pitt officials declined a grant of $30 million from the state for the
construction of a convocation center.

The state authorized $30 million in 1988, but an agreement struck
in December of 1993 delegated an immediate $13 million of that
money to Pitt for the center, which forfeited the rest of the money,
the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported Thursday.

J. W. Connoly, chair of the Board of Trustees, said the board and
interim Chancellor Mark Nordenberg were never informed that
such an agreement was made, according to the Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette. At the trustees meeting on Thursday, Connolly said that if
the deal was true, it is an embanassment to the university.

‘The delegation agreement limits the amount of commonwealth
funds that can be expended on a particular project to the amount
released,” according to Pitt’s official response, released by the

Office of Public Affairs.

The agreement made in December of 1993, in which the Post-
Gazette states O’Connor forfeited the $17 million, was a delegation
agreement.

“The delegation agreement provides a procedure that gives the
commonwealth the right of oversight,” Service said.

The agreement made by Pitt is the same type of delegation agree-
ment many schools make with the commonwealth.

The university’s official response claims that the $13 million
received for the center was part of a sum total of $69.1 million that
Governor Casey offered for the center and nine other projects. He
authorized the funding in hopes of “jump starting” the Pennsylvania
economy by funding projects at Pennsylvania universities.

“The $13 million is part of that $30 million,” said Pitt’s director
of communications, Ken Service.

Whether or not Pitt will receive the additional $17 million origi-
nally authorized for the center is still unclear, and Senior Vice

After Dr. Detre walks out the exit door,
the health sciences at Pitt will never bethe
same.

Dr. Thomas Detre’s soon—to-be vacated
position of senior vice chancellor for
health sciences may merge with the dean-
ship of Pitt’s medical school. This possibil-_
ity was brought up at Thursday’s board of
trustees meeting.

“That’s something that will be looked
at,” said Ken Service, Pitt spokesperson.

' “There’s no guarantee that it will. happen.”

Also in preparation for Detre’s April.‘ res-
ignation, two new appointments-have been
made in the health sciences department.
The first, Dr. George Michalopoulos, was
appointed associate vice chancellor for
health sciences and interim dean of the
School of Medicine. The second appoint-
-ment went to Dr. Ronald Herberman, the
current director of the University of
Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, who will serve
as associate vice chancellor for research.

. These moves mark another chapter in the
storyfof Pitt’s tra_ns_formation since J.
Dennis O’Connor announced his resigna-.

1991.

  -Top medical positions may merge

deans from their posts since then, includ-
ing the dean of CAS, has opened the door
for several restructuring possibilities.

Since the Schoolof Medicine is the
largest component of health sciences, the
combination would perhaps be more effi-
cient, Service said.-

Other universities have formed one posi-
tion out of the two, and Pitt will look at
how those arrangements have worked and
whether they would work for Pitt.

Michalopoulos, who is expected to serve
as interim dean of the School of Medicine
for two years, has served as a professor
and chairman of the Department of
Pathology at the School of Medicine since

The two-year time span allows for cer-
tain variables to fall into place. A perma-
nent dean won’t be named until Detre’s
replacement is named, and that likely
won’t happen until Pitt names a permanent
chancellor. And the possibility of the merg-
er adds more uncertainty.

Michalopoulos is the second associate
vice chancellor in the health sciences
department to be named this year. In July,
Dr. James Hemdon stepped up to the posi-
tion of associate senior vice chancellor to
give Detre administrative assistance.

SEAC protests
for bike lanes

By Steve Westrick
Staff Writer

On Friday, the Student
Environmental Action
Coalition sponsored what
members hope will become
a monthly Critical Mass
bike ride through Oakland.

SEAC members said they
hope the Critical Mass
protest will force the city
to put bike lanes on various
roads in Oakland and other
parts of Pittsburgh.

“There are a bunch of
bikers that ride to school
and work each day and
have to fear for their
” said Kim
Catanzano. SEAC member
and one of the main orga-
nizers of the event. “It’s
ridiculous.”

SEAC arranged its first
Critical Mass of the year so
that it would coincide with
other Critical Masses being
held by Colorado State
University and the
University of Denver.

“Our hope is to eventual-
ly get a nationwide Critical
Mass bike ride some day,”
said Catanzano.

Kristina Corvin, another
organizer involved in get-
ting Critical Mass off the
ground in Oakland, said

>-d
I...
<
(D
U)

 

that the main goal of
Critical Mass was to
protest the lack of bike
lanes in the city and that
SEAC had no intention of
using this Critical Mass as
a recruitment tool for its
organization.

“Recruitment was not an
influence, but it would be
great: the earth can use all
the help she can get,”
Corvin said. “However, the
main thing was to focus on
bike lanes, but we certainly
would welcome any person
interested in getting
involved in SEAC.”

“We are in a catch-22 as
far as lanes go in this city,”
Corvin said. “A lot of peo-
ple say they would ride
bikes more if there were
more bike lanes, but the
city says they will not put
in bike lanes until people
start riding more.”

Hazel Dickinson used to
be a steady bike rider.
Now, however, she no
longer rides because she
doesn’t feel safe with her
young son on the back of
her bike.

“Drivers feel bikes are
toys, but for some of us
that can’t afford a car, this

is our transportation.”

15 years ago — Friday, Oct. 24, 1980

Eric Davin, a Pitt English writing instructor and editor of
the City Times newspaper, denied charges that he was illegally
on the premises of the New Sun offices in Squirrel Hill. The
charges were made by New Sun owner and publisher Jay
Clasky.

“Now, supposedly what I did at this strange hour of the
morning was I typeset the entire City Times issue, the premier
issue,” Davin said. ‘‘I took all the camera work in his dark-
room, according to his allegations, and I stole all his office
supplies/7That, he says, is how we put out the first City
Times.”

Davin said Clasky filed charges against him, because Clasky
was afraid the City Times would put the New Sun out of busi-
ness.

When Detre announced in
July that he would stay
another year, “he indicated
he would like some help,”
Service said.

Detre announced his resig-
nation as senior vice chan-
cellor for health sciences in
the summer of 1992. Two
search committees have
since been formed, but both
have disbanded with no one
to fill the post.

The first committee nar-
rowed the search down to
four finalists, none of whom
decided to take the job. The
second committee had nar-

. rowed the search‘ down to

Pitt professor Dr. Thomas
Benz, Jr., but he took a simi-
lar post at Johns Hopkins
University. Pitt’s board of
trustees then put the appoint-
ment on hold until a replace-
ment was named for
O’Connor.

“I agreed to stay on
because it is my expectation
that it will be up to a new
chancellor, who could be
here in less than a year, [to
name a replacement],” Dr.
Detre told The Pitt News in
July.

Harrison takes the requests
and notifies an escort of the
location. The escorts are
equipped with bright T-shirts
and hand—held radios. These
escorts are available from
dusk until 1:00 a.nI.

With Pitt about to begin its
escort program in the spring,
the Student Government
Board researched other
schools, called the Urban 13.
These schools were selected
for their similar student popu-
lation, environment and crime
rate, which were similar to
Pitt’s.

The SGB and member
Patrick Huey have been
developing the project for the
safety of Pitt’s students on an
urban campus. The success of
escort services on other cam-
puses has the board optimistic
about Pitt’s pilot program.

“It has been thoroughly
researched and [the idea] has
been kicked around since
l987,” said Huey.

Many of the services stud-
ied by SGB have been in
effect for the past five to 10

- years. The escorts are stu-

dents and can be paid or can

be volunteers. At FSU.
escorts have their back-
grounds checked and are
trained in first aid and
patrolling procedures by the
police department. FSU even
uses cars for far trips, and
Akron University uses golf
carts in some situations. Most
campuses use male and
female escorts.

“A volunteer escort service
can be one of the biggest
assets to a University cam-
pus,” said Paul Stobel, direc-
tor of “Be on the Safe Side”
at the University of
Wisconsin—Milwaulkee. “It’s
very possible that your ser-
vice could save lives by pre-
venting people from walking
home alone.”

Pitt’s proposed service is
modeled after the FSU pro-
gram. Pitt will have teams of
two students who are on call
through a dispatcher at the
Department of Parking and
Transportation. SGB is cur-
rently seeking a student coor-
dinator for the position.

“Yes, the service is valu-
able,” Harrison said. “It’s so
much safer than walking
alone.”

°From page I

Chancellor of Business and
Finance Ben Tuchi could not be
reached for comment.

Service said he doesn’t know
if Pitt will definitely receive the
additional $17 million.

“That’s something I can’t
really say,” Service said.
“Officially, the state legislature
authorized that $30 million dol-
lars would be available for [the
convocation center].”

The university claims that the
original amount of $30 million
authorized in 1988 is still open.

“The original act authorizing
the $30 million in funding
remains in force, and the dele-
gation agreement does not pre-
clude the university’s represen-
tatives from seeking the addi-
tional $17 Inillion that had been
authorized by the legislature, as
they have been attempting to
do,” according to the official
statement.

“The original act that autho-
rized the $30 million is still in
force,” Service said. “The addi-
tional $17 million is still autho-
rized by the state.”

According to the statement,
while the delegation agreement
limits the amount of funds
released, “the agreement also

allows for both parties to agree
to voluntarily amend or with-
draw from the agreement. mak-
ing it possible to change the
agreement or replace it with a
new agreement.”

Little of the $13 million dol-
lars received in that 1992 agree-
ment has been used.

“The $13 million is expended
as work is done,” Service said.

Pitt hopes to open the convo-
cation center by l998, at a cost
of $52 million.

Whether an agreement was
made to pass on the additional
$17 million “depends on how
you characterize it,” Service
said. “The authorizations are in
place, but portions of the dollars
have been released.”

Service could not comment
on whether former Chancellor J.
Dennis O’Connor or other
administrators at Pitt made an
agreement with the
Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania that declined the
entire $30 million for an amount
of $13 million.

“I can’t really comment on
that. I wasn’t at the university at
the time,” Service said “I don’t
know the specifics of what he
said or who said what.”

5] Opinions
 SGB comes through

Recently some people in and out of Pitt have criticized the school

I as unsafe. Even more people, including ourselves, have criticized

various groups of school officials for being little more than inert ﬁg-
ureheads. But ﬁnally someone has taken a positive step toward mak-
ing this campus a little safer.

The Student Government Board, after months of research and
planning, will initiate a student escort service to augment the
already-existing VanCall service. The escort service will be staffed
by students who have passed a Pitt Police extensive training session.

If you have ever found yourself at the library until one or two in

it the morning, you can appreciate what it is like to walk home by

yourself. Even if you only live in the Towers, it can be a frightening
experience to walk even that short distance by yourself. But because
it is such a short distance, you would feel silly calling VanCall,

I ~ right?

This is exactly the situation with which the new student escort ser-
vice is designed to deal. If you find yourself in this kind of situation,
you can call for a walking escort to where you need to go.

Congratulations to the SGB for accomplishing one of the things it
said it would. The escort service is a good idea which has taken a lot
of time and effort to implement, and we should all commend the

. SGB for living up to its promise and providing the university com-

I»

munity with a very useful service.

Let a leader lead

Pitt’s board of trustees is playing with ﬁre at the medical school,
and if they get burned it will have a lasting negative effect on the
whole university.

The School of Medicine at Pitt is highly respected, tough to get
into and has produced many world—renowned doctors. It has been
ranked on top 10 lists of medical schools in the country. It’s one of
the reason why Pittsburgh is considered one of the best medical cen-
ters around.

But at the top of this school there is some disarray. The head of it
all is Dr. Thomas Detre, the second highest paid official at Pitt. He
resigned in 1992, andﬁnally this April he will leave. Pitt has strug-
gled to find a replacement for him, and now the board of trustees is
talking about “restructuring the med school,” combining Detre’s
position with the deanship of the medical school. ’

“Time will tell if that’s a good or bad idea‘, but either waythe deci- ’

“ sion is missing an important ingredient: a full-time, no-strings—

.1

attached chancellor.
The board is headed in the right direction. It has held frequent

' committees and meetings, all in the interests of getting a new chan-

__‘,-‘-“.:..._'..—._.:{..__._; _

cellor.
But more importantly, the board needs to let the chancellor come
into Pitt and do his or her job. Any decision made about the med

- school should be made by the chancellor. That is why we need a uni-

versity president, to make tough decisions.
J .W. Connoly and his fellow trustees should keep up the hard
work in searching for a chancellor. When they find the most quali-

fied candidate, they should hire him or her and then back off and let -

the individual lead Pitt into the next century.

Changing the course of SGB

Shawn Iattended a

meeting
Barley of the
Student Government Board,
and I only have one thing to
say: there is a definite need for
change.

Why, one might ask? Is it the
people? No. The major prob-
lem is the system under which
the government operates.

Our society is pluralistic; our
_campus_ is pluralistic — so why
can’t our form of student gov-
ernance be more pluralistic?

What is a pluralistic legal
system? Lawrence M.
Friedman, in his “Law and
Society: An Introduction,”
states, “A legal system is plu-
ralistic when there is more than
one legal [system] inside a sin-
gle nation, state, or other politi-
cal entity.” This university,
made up of men and women of
all different races, creeds and
socioeconomic backgrounds
(by the sole virtue of its con-
crete existence), constitutes
what a political scientist would
classify as a body politic —
that is, a political entity.

“In political pluralism, each
subsystem [of government] is a
territorial, political entity.”
What does all this legal jargon
mean? A subsystem in the cur-
rent SGB is a component or
branch of the governmental

apparatus. In contrast, state ,

and local governments are sub-
systems in the American sys-
tem.

In our present system, the
component which is supreme is
the board itself, which one
might construe as the executive
branch. In my opinion, that
leaves the entire undergraduate
student body (excluding night
students) with an imperial
executive branch just as the
U.S. had the imperial presiden-
cy from Franklin Delano
Roosevelt to Richard Millhouse
Nixon. As history has proven
(does Watergate ring a bell?),
power corrupts, and absolute
power conupts absolutely.

To prevent an absolute or
imperial executive, the powers
of the executive must be equal-
ly balanced by an equally pow-
erful student legislature. Thus,
a new “law” or project (such as
the escort service now pro-
posed) could only come into
existence, oran existing one
changed or removed, by the
authority of an assembly. ,

Hence, all of the work of the
current board of nine would be
thrown to a larger, more demo-
cratic assembly, reducing stress
on individual members of the
board. Moreover, wouldn’t
govemment become more efﬁ—
cient if a group of all the cur-
rent committees worked on a
project instead of one member
working forsix months, seven
days a week to no avail?

What is governmental effi-
ciency? Simple. It is the trans-
formation of the government
from what board member John
Capriotti has referred to as “the
puppet show” into the “bully
pulpit” of Theodore Roosevelt:
a government which will fight
against undue tuition increases,
the expansion of free credit on
campus which exploits student
poverty, the montage of hidden
fees, frivolous expenditures by
the administration, and, of
course, the Pitt bureaucracy.

How would this government
work? Well, let us go back to
the example of the escort ser-
vice. A voluntary representa-
tive of the Public Safety
Committee or a student at large
would propose his or her idea
to a meeting of the whole com-
mittee, chaired by an elected
head. If the committee agreed
to the idea, it would send it in a
bill form to a full session of the
assembly, or the main commit-
tee. The bill would be read
aloud by a non-partisan speaker
elected by the assembly so all
members could hear it. This
would be the first reading of
the bill.

Then, on the second reading
of the bill, debate would begin

with equal time allotted to
those who are injfavor of the
bill and those who are opposed.
Any amendments to the bill
could be called to the ﬂoor and
voted on at this time. Next, the
bill would go back to the com-
mittee from which it originated
(in our case, the Public Safety
Committee) for any final mark-
ups, amendments, etc. before
going to the third and final
reading.

On the third reading, the
Speaker would call the roll on
the issue, and the assembly
would vote the bill up or down.

If yes, the bill would go to
the board to be scrutinized line-
by—line, just like the elections
code has been similarly scruti-
nized. Then the board would
vote on it, thereby giving its
assent if it collectively votes
yes, or vetoing it if it collec-
tively says no.

A veto, however, could be
overridden by a three-fifths
majority on a re-vote by the
assembly. In addition. bills
could be further expedited by
placing bills of a similar nature
together (this is what the
Australian Parliament calls
cognate bills) or the bill could
be declared urgent. skipping the
second reading altogether and
going from first to third.

This, in my opinion. is an
independent, efficient govern-
ment representing the needs of
the entire student body, not just
those who are afﬂuent or those
which have huge electoral
power systems (like pledges)
behind them.

So, when student elections
arrive. let us not be apathetic.
let us rise to the occasion. As
the great Jean Jacques
Rousseau said: when a man [or
a woman] says of the affairs of
government. “What does it
matter to me ?" the State (read:
the government) may be given
up for lost.

I found this [“Jesus died for
you. dammit!”] editorial iron-
ic. As you spoke out against
the expression of the beliefs
held by other people, you gave
me a pretty good enlighten-
ment of your own beliefs. As a
human being, you are entitled
to hold your own opinions as
much as anyone else, and that
truth is upheld by our govem—
ment (see the Declaration of
Independence). But if “there’s
no better belief than another,”
why give to us your views con-
demning the beliefs of some-
one else? Maybe this piece
would have been practicable if

-- it was left unwritten.

Scott Ney
CAS Sophomore

I am writing in response to
the article “Jesus died for you,
dammit,” written by Sean
Duncan, that appeared in The
Pitt News on Tuesday, Oct. 17.

The article presented an
aggravated opinion of the pro-
motion and distribution of lit-
erature by a local church.
However, the author, who con-
centrates on the distribution of
this literature solely, misrepre-
sents its content. The author
makes the statement, “If I am
not mistaken, religion is a per-
sonal belief ...” He later writes,
“It brainwashes the masses,
stealing their right to think for
themselves ...” If one believes
that religion is a personal
belief, then how can it brain-
wash the masses? In order to
have 'a personal belief, one
needs to decide for hirn/herself

A nuclear’ reaction

When I was in my sixth
grade social studies class, I
recall hearing the viewpoints
of my classmates concerning
nuclear war and its historical
significance. Iheard state-
ments like “well, they started
it, so we should bomb them”
and “people who don’t think
America is right are bad.”
Obviously, 11 and 12-year-
olds cannot expect to be held
accountable for their political
analyses.

However, when I opened the
Oct. 18 The Pitt News, I read a
column written by Matt Mills
espousing similar ideas. Mills
made statements in
“Mushroom clouds in the
mail” like “  anyone getting
teary—eyed about Hiroshima
should be deported. War is
supposed to be about destruc-
tion, and we perfected the art.
Besides, they started it.” He
then rails against the conven-
tion of a more “humane” inva-
sion, since that would have
cost the U.S. an estimated one
million lives. (Forget about
non-American lives: why
should he care about them?)
Mills has the audacity to say
that anyone favoring that
method is obviously anti-

‘American! I wonder what

Mills thinks we should do
with those anti-Americans?
Hang them from a tree?

Publicly. humiliate -them? Kill-

whether or not he/she will
believe it. Brainwashing
implies an involuntary surren-
der to a set of beliefs; a per-
sonal decision is in no way
involuntary.

Later on in the article, the
author refers to religion as
being something “sacred” and
states that it is being “sold like
a cheap advertisement.” Then
he questions, “Why must they
cheapen it by prostituting it on
the streets?” Something that is
sacred cannot be used to
“brainwash the masses.”
Additionally, religion is not
being “sold” or “prostituted.”
It sounds to me like it is being
given away freely. Nobody is
forcing anyone to take a pam-
phlet and read it, or talk to the
people passing them’ out, for
that matter.

I am a born again Christian.
That means that I have made a
personal decision and commit-
ment to God. There was no
brainwashing involved. There
was no mindless following. I
simply recognized a common
human need, the need for sal-
vation through Christ, and met
it in my life. The author is
“cheapening’~’ religion by writ-
ing such a degrading article
about it and the people that are
trying to share it.

Kimberly Keller
Sophomore, pre-Social Work

I was just wondering if your
managing editor has ever heard
of the Bill of Rights? After
reading his editorial in
Tuesday’s paper, I have serious

them to protect national secu-
rity interests? They might be
communists, God forbid, and
we all know that dissenting
opinions are not allowed in a
dictatorship (I mean, a democ-
racy).

I don’t think Matt Mills
thought through the issues
concerning nuclear proli_fera—
tion — I think he just likes to
appeal to populist, xenophobic
rhetoric and to sound very,
very unintelligent.

Beware the Ides of a
Million Man March

Minister Farrakahn, minister
of the Nation of Islam,
received a message from God
to call one million black men
to march in Washington on
October 16. They marched.
There is some dispute to how
many were actually there, but
that is another argument. What
I want to address are the views
opposing the march.

I have heard in conversation,
on the television, or on the
radio that people did not like
the idea of this march because
it did not include all races.
Well, now -is the time that
black men -should take full
responsibility for themselves

and their communities. White

;Voicing their opinions...  
- Religion, rhetoric and righteous indignation  

doubts. Well, for his informa-
tion, there is a section called
the First Amendment which
gives EVERYONE the right to
voice his or her own opinions
whether on the corner or in a
college newspaper. It is the
right of free speech that allows
him to publish his Great
Hypocritical Manifesto.
Arguing freedom of mind is
the “cool” thing for college
students to do, I gather. But I
must respond by saying that in
no way does religion steal peo-
ple’s right to think for them-
selves. Skewed philoso-
phies?!? Mr. Duncan’s twisted
concept of religion is apparent-
ly the source of his intolerance.
I have to ask why he must
denounce organizations that
preach love and understanding
instead of hate and violence
(such as the violence and intol-
erance encouraged in the arti-
cle). This nation would be in
much worse shape if not for
the work of religious groups as

~well as the intentions of all

good and moral people. Could
you imagine a world in which
everyone “did their own
thing?” These religious organi-
zations do a lot more good
than they are given credit for.
They need all the help they can
get. Many people feel that
these programs are worth
advertising.

In almost every religion, it is
not merely good enough to
have beliefs._ It is everyone’s
duty to spread their beliefs.
Most do it by the ignorant

masses (led by people like Mr.

people have held us back for
hundreds of years; we’ve been
given token freedom and
token opportunities to advance
ourselves. Now is the time
when the black community
has the capital, education and
potential to really make a
strong push to equal or better
the living conditions in the
black community to that of
white Americans. October 16
was the time to let black peo-
ple and the rest of America
know. At the march, there
were discussions about crime,
joblessness, drugs, deadbeat
fathers, etc. Improvements on
issues such as those in the
black community can only
make America a better place
to live for you and me.

Some people believe that
women should have been
invited to march with their
fathers, brothers, husbands,
etc. I believe there is a time
and a place for most every-
thing, and this was a time for
black men to get together and
figure out ways to help the
black women who have held
our community together for
the last thirty years. Part of the
reason men felt so obligated to
march was because as a whole
we have let our black mothers,
sisters and wives down, and
we are going to make an effort
to better ourselves, which will
inevitably help you too.

march was not just all about

Hey, Wait!
We have
feelings too!

When will The Pitt News
get its act together and pub-
lish some news that is wortl
reading aside from the police
blotter? I can imagine that
most of the people on the
paper’s staff are planning tc
go into journalism once they
leave Pitt. Therefore, I
assume that they are not just
writing articles for the sheet
fun of it, but are truly inter-
ested in creating compelling
reports that the campus car
really appreciate and find use-
ful. For three years (now, 1
have seen a paper filled witl
almost nothing but mindless
stories that are hardly more
useful to Pitt students than 2
grocery store tabloid.

part expose uncovering

mind.-Who would have evet

that I am not the only student
who can’t wait for the next

good stuff!

With Miami’s storm hushed to a pacify-
ing warm breeze on a nippy Saturday
afternoon, Pitt almost did the unthinkable.
The Panthers were in position to put a
major blemish on the nation’s winningest
football program of the past decade.

But in the end, Pitt squandered six
Hurricane turnovers as the Panthers lost
17-16 in front of 28,794 subdued
Homecoming fans at Pitt Stadium.

After winning its first two games, Pitt
has now lost its sixth consecutive game
and has assured the Panthers of yet anoth-
er losing season.

“Just a little finishing touches today,
two or three critical errors, we would

have won the game,” Pitt coach Johnny‘

Majors said.

One of those errors happened on Pitt’s
final drive after Miami (3-3) scored the
go-ahead touchdown with 5:49 remaining
in the game. .

Down by one, Mark Butler returned
Miami’s kickoff to Pitt’s 43-yard line,
giving the Panthers good field position to
start the drive. ’

On a fourth—and-four situation, Miami
jumped offsides to give Pitt a first down.
After a Chris Patton two-yard run and
two Pete Gonzalez incompletions, Pitt
was again looking at a fourth~down situa-
tion. This time, Gonzalez, starting his
first collegiate game, was forced out of
the pocket and fired a strike to Miami’s
all-everything linebacker Ray Lewis. The
interception ended Pitt’s improbable

 upset bid as the‘ Hurricanes sat on the ball

for the remainder of the game.

Gonzalez, a redshirt sophomore from
Miami, took over for a futile John Ryan,
but the results were the same. Gonzalez
completed four of 20 passes for 100
yards. He also netted 20 yards on the
ground and ran for Pitt’s only touchdown.

Soccer wins

By Connie Nigro ’
Staff Writer ’

The Pitt soccer team continued its
winning streak, upping its wins to five
straight by defeating Notre Dame 3-0 in
Big East play Sunday afternoon at Pitt
Stadium. The Panthers improved their
overall record to 10-4 and 6-2 in Big
East play.

Pitt set a new record yesterday for the
most Big East wins in a season. The pre-
vious record of five Conference wins
was held by the l992.team. Also mov-
ing toward breaking a record is goalie
Adam Spitzer, who posted his fifth
shutout this season. Spitzer is now tied
for second place on Pitt’s shutout list.

Yesterday was the perfect day for the
Panthers to set new school records, as
they welcomed alumni and the young-
sters from North Allegheny and Liberty
Burrow soccer leagues.

After coming off a win last Tuesday
against Carnegie Mellon, the Pitt soccer
team picked up where-it left off. Sixteen
minutes and 56 seconds into the game,
freshman Drew Kopp found the net and
beat Notre Dame goalie Greg Velito.
Kopp’s goal was assisted by senior Jeff
Porter. The goal was Kopp’s sixth of the
season. He leads the team in goals. I

for this team, but being my first start, I
just went out there and did the things the
coaches asked me to do,” Gonzalez said.
“And I feel for the future I will be a good
leader for this team. I’ll lead them to a
championship someday.”

Pitt’s game plan was clear: run, run and
run the ball some more. The end product
wasn’t so clear. The Panthers held the ball
for seven more minutes but only gained
132 yards on 43 attempts. Patton led the
attack with 44 yards.

“We tried to shorten the game, milk the
clock,” Majors said.

Majors’ game plan, coupled with a
handful of Miami turnovers, kept Pitt in
the game.

Two of Miami’s first three possessions
ended with turnovers. On the third play of
the game, Hurricane quarterback Ryan
Clement threw into double coverage, and

Dame yielded the field to the visiting
youngsters from North Allegheny and
Liberty Burrow, who had a mock game
on- one side of the field.

As the second half began, the
Panther’s attack on the fighting Irish

freshman Rasshad Whitmill picked it off.
The Panthers did nothing with the oppor-
tunity and were forced to punt.

But Miami’s second gaffe cost it three
points. After the Hurricanes forced Pitt to
punt again, Magic Benton fumbled the
kick into Sadiq Durham’s hands at

 

Miami’s 23-yard line. After three feeble’ ‘

running plays, freshman kicker Chris
Ferencik booted a 34-yarder to give Pitt a
3-0 lead with 6:45 remaining in the first
quarter.

Benson redeemed himself the following
kickoff as he cracked a seam and headed
down field to Miami’s 47-yard line, only
to be stopped by Pitt’s backup kicker
Chris Burnett. Four plays later, Clement
rolled out and connected with Syii Tucker
for a 15-yard touchdown strike. With 5:23
left in the first quarter, Pitt trailed 7-3.

continued. Two minutes in, after Notre
Dame goalie Velito made a nice diving
save, Pitt freshman Phil Matilla scored
his first collegiate goal. Matilla headed
in a shot after it rebounded off the cross-
bar. The goal put the Panthers ahead 2-
0. But the fighting Irish continued to
fight.

Down 2-0, the Irish pulled out all the
stops. Pitt’s defense and goalie Adam
Spitzer ceased Notre Dame’s offensive
attack. To help out Spitzer and the
defense, Pitt created a number of offen-
sive scoring chances as well. ,

“It was a great effort by the whole
team. We knew what we had to do,” Pitt
senior J.L. Gorsin said.

In the final 20 minutes of the game,
Pitt and Notre Dame were going back
and forth with scoring chances. Pitt’s
Jeff Porter led a pretty passing play that
resulted in a shot on goal. Velito was
forced to make a save.

The Panther attack continued.

A few minutes later, Porter was again
streaking into the Notre Dame end.
Porter dribbled by the Notre Dame play-
ers with ease and once again tested
Velito, who came up with the save.

Next it was Spitzer who was chal-
lenged.

Spitzer rose to the occasion with the
aid of his defense. With 11 minutes
remaining, Notre Dame attempted to get

Quarterback Pete Gonzalez looks for help in the Panther’s game against Miami.

By Marc Rosenberg
For The Pitt News

No one in Pitt Stadium figured Pete
Gonzalez’s 28-yard completion to Dietrich
Jells late in the third quarterwould be the last
of the day. Most fans believed he still had
more left. It was Gonzalez’s fourth, and,
unfortunately, his final completed pass of the
afternoon. Yet, the 28,000-plus fans stood by
the sophomore in his first ever start Saturday
against the enemy Hurricanes of

Panther’s fifth drive. The first was a rainbow
down the left side to Dietrich Jells for 40
yards. The second came two plays later when
he dropped off a short screen to Demetrius
Harris for a 15-yard gain. The two plays
helped set up a Pitt touchdown.

Although his numbers paled by comparison
to those of Hurricane quarterback Ryan
Clement, Gonzalez was part of the reason
Pittsburgh held the lead for most of the after-
noon. His four completions were good for
100 yards. Moreover, his 20

Can anyone fault Gonzalez for

Quarterback down.

“Overall, I thought he handled the game
plan very well,” Pitt head coach Johnny

touches today, and we would have won the
game. I thought we had some great efforts all
the way around.”

Gonzalez struggled in the first quarter,

think I was trying to throw the ball a little too
hard or trying to push it,” he said. “Once I
settled down, everything started clicking.”
The second period fared better for the Pitt
quarterback, however. Both of Gonzalez’s
first—half completions came during the

“Being my first start,”
Gonzalez explained, “I went out there and
did what the coaches asked me to do. I feel as
though for the future I’ll be good for this
team, and hopefully win a championship here
someday.”

Have no fear fans, the redshirt sophomore
has _room for improvement. With two years of
eligibility left, Gonzalez has plenty of time to
lead this team to a national championship.

jerks are ruining people’s
chances of improving their
career skills and having fun.
When are they going to
realize that few listen to
that station except when the
Sports Journal airs?

°With Atlanta’s win in
game one of the World
Series, there can be no
doubt that Greg Maddux is
the greatest pitcher to come
along in the last twenty
years. His two-hit, no-walk,
no-earned-run performance
against the most powerful
offensive team since the
1927 New York Yankees
should convince any
doubters.

°The myth of Orel
Hershsisher in the playoffs
was_fina1ly broken. This

overrated chump, who had
three good seasons and
posted a 4.47 ERA this sea-
son, gets lucky in the post-
season. Hopefully, the
undeserving Orel bandwag-
on will derail soon, injuring
all those riding.
°Once again a Mario
Lemieux- Wayne Gretzky
confrontation was not in the
cards Saturday night.
Because Lemieux played
much more than expected in
a 2-2 tie with Hartford on
Friday, he rested on
Saturday. The Igloo fans
were deprived of a this
match-up once again.
°Once Sergei Zubov

returns from a finger injury,
the Penguins will run away
with the Stanley Cup. Their
offense is unstoppable.

°In the world of the NBA,
look for Jerry Stackhouse to
have more impact as a rook-
ie than any player since ’
Magic Johnson.

°Speaking of the Lakers,
that young, talented bunch
looks primed and ready to
make a serious run at the
NBA Championship. With
Eddie Jones, Nick Van
Exel, Cedric Ceballos and
the re-emergence of Vlade
Divac, they field one the
best starting squads in the
league.

Hopefully after next
week, my spirits will have
been lifted, and I will once
again smile.

°From page 7

Almost a quarter later, the
Panthers punched in their only
touchdown of the game.
Starting at its own 23, Pitt
notched three of its 12 total
first downs on the drive. The
first came on Chris
Schneider’s 7—yard run up the
middle. Gonzalez then com-
pleted his first pass of the
game when he hit a streaking
Dietrich Jells for a 40-yard
gainer. After a 2-yard quarter-

sions led to turnovers. The
first-came when running back
Dyral McMillan, fighting for
a few extra‘ yards, was
stripped by John Jenkins and
David Sumner recovered it.
The next came after Miami
was driving steadily down
field. Scott Covington, who
replaced Clement late in the
third quarter, was picked Off
by Sumner on a fourth—and-12
play. Sumner returned it 30
yards to Miami’s 47-yard line.

into halftime
with a 13-7 lead.

“From my point of view,
this was the first time we’ve
played like a good team
since the first half of the
Virginia Tech game,” Majors
said.

On Miami’s first possession
of the ha1f;"Pitt"s defense
swarmed as it pinned the
‘Canes on its own 3-yard line,
forcing them to punt.

The Panthers were sure to
get the ball with good field
position, but Pitt was ﬂagged
with a roughing-the—kicker
penalty, which gave~Miami
the ball back at its own 18.

Two minutes and 43 yards
later, Dane Prewitt kicked a
45-yard field goal-to cut Pitt's
lead to 13-10. 0

Set up by a 28-yard slant to
Jells, the Panthers responded
with 2:48 left in the third
when Ferencik nailed a 39-
yard field goal. -

The next two Miami posses-

Danyell Ferguson
for a 17-yard gainer. At the
end of the play, Pitt was
flagged for a questionable late
hit call, which stapled on
another 15 yards to the play.

Two first downs later,
Ferguson ran 16 yards virtual-
ly untouched to the end zone.
‘After the extra point, Miami
led 17-16 with 5:49 left.

“At the time, we felt
Clement had a better feel what
Pitt was trying to do defen-
sively,” Davis said about his
quarterback switch. ‘

Miami, which used to light
up Scoreboards with its high-
Octane attack, was contained
all afternoon by Pitt’s defense.

“Nothing was pretty but the
score,” Davis said. *

“Mentally, I think we lost
that frame of mind of how to
win,” Sumner said. “It hurts a
lot, because" we played well
enough to win. I’m kind of in

back in the game on a corner
kick. The kick was blocked

and cleared on a good defen- .

sive effort ‘by senior Keith
Hoetzlein.

“Keith Hoetzlein played his
best effort today,” Luxbacher
said. '

With just under 10 minutes
to play, the fighting Irish
would have one last chance
to redeem themselves and
prevent a shutout. They were
awarded a direct kick just 10
feet from Spitzer and the
goal. Pitt made a wall in front
of Spitzer and prevented the
shot from going through.

“Our guys played hard and
tough,” Luxbacher said.

With a two-goal lead and a
frustrated Notre Dame team,
Pitt kept the pressure on

through .th'e'final minutes of
  the game.-t'».With 4:29 rem_ain-.

 

ing, Pitt sophomore Jason

Piombino scored to put the
game out of reach.

“We got the results we
wanted,” Gorsin said.

Despite major upsets over
Rutgers and St. John’s and
major Big East victories, Pitt
remains unranked and unrec-
ognized.

“I don’t get involved in
that. All you do is get frus-

-trated,” Luxbacher said of the

ranking system.

Luxbacher understands the
importance of rank but has
not let the fact that Pitt is not
ranked get in the way of
what’s necessary.

“The fact is we gotta keep
winning,” Luxbacher said.
“We gotta keep winning and

just let the chips fall.”
