If you’re reading this letter, congratulations.
You’re nowia member of one of the most
vibrant student communities in the country.
To put it simply, Pitt has something for ev-
eryone, whether you’re interested in sports,
writing, science or a bevy of other student
activities.

This level of freedom can admittedly be
intimidating; There are over 18,000 stu-
dents at Pitt——- a number that can make one
feel as though they’re simply a number rather
than a face. This likely differs greatly from
your experience in high school, where you
knew most of the people you graduated with.
How, then, do you determine where you’ll
ﬁt over the next four years? '

That’s where The Pitt News can help.

Within this New Student Guide, you’ll
ﬁnd a number of articles that can help you
acclimate to this new and exciting environ-
ment. Whether it’s neighborhood guides
or comentary on issues facing students to-
day from columnists who have experienced
them, The Pitt News has itcovered.

But, more importantly, this New Student
Guide can help you gain a greater under-
standing of what it means to be a Pitt student.
Because, from my own experience,'I can tell
you that the real college experience isn’t
just sitting in classrooms during lecture or
spending countless hours studying in Hill-
man Library. The real college experience is

Summer, 2018 I The Pitt News 1 vvvvvv.pittnevve.eom

Letter from the Editor: Welcome to Pitt and the Pitt News

a combination of the people you meet and
the experiences you have during your four
years here. Although it has been awhile, I
can remember moving in freshman year,
excited to take advantage of the countless
opportunities offered by the University.
And while all of the other pamphlets con-
tained within your new student bundle con-
tain a great deal of information, I’m positive
that none of them will prove as valuable as

the newspaper that you’re currently holding .

in your hands.

Unlike the other freshman orientation
guides, The Pitt News is entirely student-run.
Our editors and writers have all worked tire-
lessly to prepare this guide for you in order
to make your transition into the college life
as smooth as possible. We’ve worked this
hard to produce the guide because we have
all experienced the situation that you ﬁnd
yourself in right now; arriving in a new en-
vironment and needing a sense of direction.

Look through our opinions section and read ,

ﬁrst hand accounts of what it’s like adjusting

to a new environment as a freshman in col—-

lege. Check out our sports section and get a

preview for the upcoming sports seasons.
But our services don’t end with this New

Student Guide. Throughout the school year,

The Pitt News publishes daily, providing the A
Pitt student body with a readily-accessible’
guide on day—to—day happenings on campus. -

Over the past year, we’ve covered issues rang-
ing from secret societies on campus to the
Pittsburgh mayoral election. And the cover-
age doesn’t stop there. We’re here to inform
you of .the issues that affect you as a student.

You also have the ability to improve The
Pitt News’s coverage simply by acting as a

"concerned student. Pitt isja large campus

with a large student population, and, de-
spite our best efforts, we sometimes miss
the oportunity to cover all news stories on
campus. By getting in contact with one of
our reporters or editors, you have the ability
to serve as an advocate for theiPitt student
body.

Or maybe you have strong opinions and
would like to respond to one of our columns
or editorials. We’re always open to publishing
letters to the editors ‘in order to generate
discourse on campus regarding the issues
thatare important to Pittpstudents.

So with that in mind, why not make The
Pitt News a part of your daily routine? Be-
fore you go to class each morning, pick up
a copy of the newspaper at any of the racks
located across campus. Check out how the
basketball team did the night before, or what
new initiative Student Government Board
members are working on. In doing so, you
may ﬁnd yourself wanting to become more
active on campus. And if nothing else, you’ll

at least have a topic to discuss with your ’

friends during Saturday morning breakfast
at Market Central. A

And if you really enjoy what you’re read-
ing, you might even decide to join The Pitt
News staff. If you have an interest in photog-

_ raphy, join ourvisual section. Or, if you enjoy

staying on top of the latest news on campus,

' apply to become a reporter within our news

section. If you’re someone who wants to
showcase your talents, there’s a good chance
The Pitt News staff has a place for you.
The truth is, The Pitt New isn’t sim-
ply for students hoping to enter the ﬁeld
of journalism. While we have had former
staff members go onto to write for presti-
gious publications such as Time Magazine
and The New York Times,we’ve had just as
many enter the ﬁelds of medicine, law and
business. That’s because the experience of
working for a college newspaper instills in
you the value of hard work, responsibility

and creativity; attributes that are valuable V

in any career path. »

I hope you leave your Pittstart session
excited for this next stage of your life. Enjoy
the remainder of your summer, and we’ll see
you all in August.

Hail to Pitt!

After catching any of the 61—route buses on
Forbes Avenue and riding them for 1C3 minutes
past Carnegie Mellon University’s campus until
the intersection of Forbes and Murray, students
will have arrived at the heart of the Squirrel Hill
shopping and dining district: Murray Avenue.
As students exit the bus they’ll be intro-
duced to the many shops and restaurants that
Squirrel Hill provides to cater to the residents
ofPittsburgh and the neighboring communities.
“Just as they say small businesses are what
deﬁne Pittsburgh, the same goes for the neigh-
borhoods of Pittsburgh,”_]oseph Coleman, 54,
a lifelong Squirrel Hill resident said while he
drank a cup of coffee outside of the Crazy Mocha
on Murray Avenue. “Squirrel Hill is a cultural
gem of Pittsburgh, and the best part is that the
restaurants on Murray boast the abundance of
culture in the neighborhood.”
Restaurants along Murray Avenue provide
a wide selection of options that ranges from
Eat’n Park to the Murray Avenue Grill, and from
Bangkok Balcony to Curry on Murray.
Students can also visit one of the oldest mov-
ie theaters in Pittsburgh. The Manor Theatre,

East Carson Street offers a myriad of shops for visitors. Jarett Stewart | Senior Staff Photographer

Cassidy Davis
Stcyff Writer

Just across the Monongahela River from Oak-
land lies a Pittsburgh neighborhood that has
undergone one of the most dramatic transfor-
mations of any area in the United States. It’s
name, the South Side, is simple, and its nightlife
is well-known nationwide.

Originally known for earning Pittsburgh’s
reputation as the “Workshop of the World,”
South Side was ﬁrst home to many glass, iron
and steel works in the 1800s. The many immi-
grants that called this community home trans-
formed the neighborhood into the diverse and
lively South Side of today.

Most of the action in the South Side happens
on East Carson Street, the home of numerous
shops, restaurants and tattoo parlors. From
Oakland, students can reach East Carson Street
on 75, which runs up the street to South Side
Works, a complex of shopping centers, restau-
rants and a movie theater. They can also the 54
C and 54 D buses, which run for several blocks
along East Carson Street in the opposite direc~
tion from South Side Worlcs.

South Side offers an array of dining options
with restaurants ranging from Claddagh Irish
Pub, Hofbrauhaus and the Ibiza Tapas 8: Wine
Bar to the traditional Pittsburgh eatery Primanti
Bros.

Cece King, who graduated from Pitt in April
with a degree in psychology, said the atmo-i
sphere of the South Side sets it apart from other
neighborhoods in Pittsburgh.

“The atmosphere down there is so much
more lively,” King said. “People are ready to go.”

King said you go to South Side to do some
shopping when you’re under 21, but when you

are over the legal drinking age you might go to
South Side with different intentions.
When King turned 21, she and some friends

attended various bars to check out the nightlife,
and they have been returning ever since. Some
of her favorite clubs are the Carson City Saloon
and the Tiki Lounge.

“Carson City is the best one because they
always play the cool music and it’s always fun,”
King said.

King said she loves the atmosphere at Carson
City, and that Tiki Lounge tends to get pretty
smoky, but still has an “eccentric” atmosphere.

Accordingto its website, the Tiki Lounge has
a Polynesian ﬂare and models itselfafter the tiki
bars that were popular during the 195o’s and
1960’s. The bar hosts regulars during the week
and D] dance parties on the weekend.

Butthe South Side isn’t simply one big party.
It has attractions for visitors of any age.

Kristen Frese, a sophomore communication
sciences and disorders major, said that she and
her roommates have visited South Side several
times since coming to Pitt.

“You can go down there and make a day of
it,” Frese said. i

Frese enjoys going to South Side, grabbing
a bite to eat at one of the local restaurants, and
stopping to watch a movie at Southside Works
before returningto campus. SouthSide Works is
at the end of East Carson Street where it rounds‘
out to a circle of shops —— such as Forever 21,

Claire’s and Urban Outfitters — restaurants’

and a movie theater.
Frese said The Cheesecake Factory is one of
the most popular places to celebrate abirthday

' for Pitt students and families alike.

“It’s nice when you see a lot of students, but
you see families and little kids around too, and
it’s nice to see other people — not just teenag-
ers,” Frese said.

She cited one visit in particular when the
majority of her ﬂoor ventured to the South Side

Historical legacy still

Gideon Bradshaw
News Editor

The Strip District, a narrow piece of land that
runs along the Allegheny River, is a place
of stark contrasts. Old, overgrown railroad
tracks sit only a few blocks from the main
arteries of the city’s traffic. Monochrome
brick warehouses loom over Bohemian street
vendors.

“I have always had this sense that Pitts-
burghers feel like everybody owns [the Strip
District],” historian Lauren Uhl said. O

The neighborhood, which is located be-
tween Lawrenceville and the Cultural District,
is a 20-minute ride from Oakland on the 54C
and 54D buses. Penn and Liberty Avenues,
two of the major streets threading through
Downtown, and Smallman Street run par-
allel through the neighborhood. While the
factories and warehouses that once formed a
backbone for the steel industry are no longer
operational, the neighborhood is an ideal
destination for students looking for new and
fun experiences.

Sam Harper, a communication and Eng—
lish literature major who will be a senior in
the fall, said that when her family came to
visit her a year ago, she brought them to the
Strip District for a day trip.

She remembered the outdoor vendors
who sold art, pastries, clothing and inter-
national food.

Vendors ll 2:  of”  ater tenitrp strict

Jarett Stewart] Senior Staff Photographer

“There was a lot of unique stuff,” Harper
said. “Like there was one vendor who had
ﬂattened [liquor] bottles so that they could
be used as serving platters.”

She said that her family bought several

platters. She said that they also enjoyed S

Wholey’s Fish Market, a large indoor seafood
market between Penn and Liberty avenues.

:-

The bustling, lively atmosphere in the aisles
lined with stands and vendors felt like avery
different experience from a standard trip to
the grocery store.

Uhl, who co—authored the 2003 book,
“Pittsburgh’s Strip District: Around the World
in a Neighborhood,” said that the neighbor-
hood started out as_ vacant land. When ‘fac-

inﬂuences eclecticism of Strip District

tories began opening in the 19th century, the
Strip District’s access to the river made it an
ideal shipping hub. . . V

Liberty Avenue, the broad one-way street
that runs through the East End before passing
through the Strip and into Downtown, used
to be a railroad line until the city turnedit
into a major street.

Although the wholesale produce industry
might have died, the -Strip District still boasts

i L the Farmers @ Firehouse Market on the 2200

block of Penn Ave., where customers from
all over the city purchase organic products,
usually from the growers themselves.

Uhl is also a project manager at the Heinz
History Center, a museum in the Strip Dis-
trict. She said that when she and her col-
leagues ﬁrst moved into the museum, it was

. a warehouse buildingthat a lumber company

used for storage. This feeling of transition
from the industrial to the more modern has
made the neighborhood unique, with graphic
designers and artists setting up’shop in old

' warehouses.

“Because it kind of has a quirky person-
ality, it kind of appeals to creative types,”
she said.

No shortage of dining options on campus, elsewhere in

Andrew Fishman
Staff W riter

At Pitt, students don’t have to roam far
for a good meal.

But with the number of on—campus
dining facilities nearby restaurants, it
may be overwhelming for incoming stu-
dents to chose where to eat. As students
will come to realize, options are a good
thing. Not only are there options of es-
tablishments, but also options of how to
pay for the food as well.

Every incoming freshman living in
University housing is required to pur-
chase a meal plan that includes both din-
ing hall swipes and dining dollars.

“The benefits of eating on a meal plan
are value, convenience and flexibility,”
Susan Fukushima, Resident District Man-
ager of Sodexo, said. “Dining plans are
not subject to sales tax. Off-campus eat-
eries do charge sales tax. [In addition],
students on a dining plan know they can
select from a wide variety of offerings
without worrying about how much money
they have in their pocket.”

Market Central and The Perch are
located directly within the Towers and

Sutherland residence halls, respectively. .

This is convenient for the students who
live in these halls, and it’s common to
see students eating in slippers and pa-
jama pants. ‘

“We also do all the work for you,” Fu-
kushima said in an email. “We do the
shopping, cooking and cleaning up so
students have more time for their aca-
demic pursuits.”

Aside from the two main dining halls, ’

Sodexo-run eateries are also located in

the William Pitt Union, the basement
of the Cathedral of Learning and at the
Peterson Events Center, where several
different fast food counters take dining
dollars rather than meal swipes.

Sodexo offers twenty differently-
priced meal plans with varying amounts
of swipes and dining dollars to meet the
needs of every students. These plans in-
clude the “Ultimate Access” plan, which
offers unlimited meal passes and a num-
ber of dining dollars that depends on the
tier of the plan, which range from A to C.

An additional aspect of Pitt’s meal
plans are Panther Funds: a prepaid, safe
alternative to carrying cash. While Pan-
ther Funds can be used at all of the on-
campus dining facilities, students can use
them at some establishments on Forbes
and Fifth Avenues and many of the sur-
rounding streets‘. ‘

Students on campus know they can eat at
Market Central, do their laundry and hop on
a Port Authority bus with the help of their
Pitt ID cards, but many students don’t realize
that their ID cards can also grant them ac-
cess to many restaurants and cultural events
in the city.

Concerts, symphonies, ballets, operas
and much more of Pittsburgh’s vibrant cul-
ture scene are all available to Pitt students
through the University program called Pitt
Arts. Even more exciting than the perfor-
mances, exhibitions and dining offered by
Pitt Arts, all the events are offered free of
charge, and are available to all undergradu-
ates with a University ID.

Over a decade of Pitt students have al-
ready explored the Pittsburgh ﬁne arts com-
munity at no cost since the launch of Pitt
Arts in 19 97. The program, funded by the Of-
ﬁce of the Provost, aims to educate students
in international and cultural awareness.
Pitt Arts motivates students to continue
their educations out of the classroom with
exposure to the arts, which help to develop
students into well-rounded citizens and
leaders.

Annabelle Clippinger, director of Pitt
Arts, said the program is founded on

the principle that Pitt’s campus extends
throughout the city. «

“The University has a unique location in
an urban center with many arts and cultural
offerings,” Clippinger said in an email.

Pitt Arts offers Free Arts Encounters, a
free program with limited seats per event.
The organization also provides Cheap Seats,
a program in which the University purchases
blocks of tickets for performances at vari-
ous venues so that students can purchase
tickets at lower prices than members of the
general public.

Venues Pitt Arts has worked with include
the Pittsburgh Opera, the Pittsburgh Ballet
Theatre, the Pittsburgh Symphony Orches-
tra, the Pittsburgh Public Theater, Phipps

Conservatory, the Pittsburgh Folk Music.

Society, the Guitar Society of Fine Art and
the Andy Warhol Museum among many oth-
ers, according to the Pitt Arts website.

The Free Arts Encounters program en-
ables students to explore Pittsburgh’s ﬁne
art and culinary scene by attending perfor-
mances and events, providing transporta-
tion, a catered reception and an exclusive
question—and-answer session with the art-
ists or directors of the event, all at no cost
to the student.

Congress potentially to raise federal student loan rates in

Danielle Fox
S taﬁ" PVrz'ter

Affording college is no easy task, but for the
upcoming graduating class of 2017, covering
tuition costs may become increasingly difficult
as interest rates on Direct Stafford Subsidized
loans may double onjuly 1.

The interest on Direct Stafford Subsidized
Loans is covered by the U.S. Department of
Education while a student is enrolled full-time
in an institution of higher education, for six
months after a student leaves a school and

during a period known as deferment, and is
at a current rate of 3.4 percent.

Interest is calculated as an annual percent-
age of the principal loan. If the interest rates
on student loans double, students will pay
higher monthly installments on their student
loans. For example, if a student had $10,000
in Stafford Loan debt with an interest rate of
6.8 percent, he or she would pay about $115
a month after the six—month grace period fol-
lowing graduation. At the end of the payback
process, the total interest on the loan would
be about $3,810. .

Currently, a student who owes $10,000 in

Pittslatngh, PA 15206

Stafford Loan debt with an interest rate of 3.4
percent would only pay about $98 a month,
and his or her interest would only total around
$1,810, or about $2,000 less than it would
under the proposed increase. »

Last year, on July 29, Congress voted to
extend the 3.4 percent interest rate on subsi-
dized Stafford loans for the 2012-2013 school
year, preventing the rate from rising to 6.8
percent as previously scheduled after budget
cuts shrunk ﬁinding for the loans. The decision
was part of President Barack Obama’s “Mov-
ing Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century
Act of 2012.”

A simple majority was all that was required
to pass the act, but 86 percent of Congress
voted in favor. It was a relatively even divide
between parties as 187 Democrats and 186 Re-
publicans voted yea. However, all 52 opposition
votes were from Republican Representatives.

All19 Pennsylvania representatives voted
in favor of the bill.

But unlike last year, when Congress voted
to keep the interest rates at their current level,
President Obama is no longer facing the pres-
sure of re-election, and there is much less of an
incentive for him to put pressure on Congress
to broker a deal. _

This year, there are four different bills at—
tempting to stop rates from doubling by mak-
ing amendments to the “Higher Education Act
of 1965 .” In the House of Representatives, H.R.
1498 H.R. 1595, and H.R. 1443 are all attempt-
ing to block the interest rate increase as S. 707
is also attempting in the.Senate. All of these
bills were introduced in April.

H.R. 1498, H.R. 1595, and H.R. 1443 have
bgggreferred to the House Committee on Edu-
cation and the Workforce and S. 707 has been
referred to the Senate’s Committee on Health,
Education, Labor, and Pensions.

H.R. 1595 has gathered the most support
so far. First, sponsored by Representativejoe

Courtney, D—CT, the bill has 137 éo-sponsors’,

Like H.R. 1595, the three other bills are spon-

_ sored by Democratic Representatives.

In Obama’s latest budget “Cuts, Consolida-
tions, and Savings,” which was introduced on
April 24, the President proposeda plan to limit
the in-school interest subsidy of Stafford loans
to 150 percent of the normal program length
and to reduce the amount of excessive payment
plans from guaranty agencies.

This means students who have not com-
pleted their programwithin 150 percent of the
time needed for completion will be charged
interest on their loans before their graduation
date. This is opposed to current standards,
where students are notcharged interest until
they graduate. _

Pitt spokesmanjohn Fedele said in an email
that under the proposed changes a student
who has been-enrolled in an academic program
longer than 150 percent of itspublished pro-
gram length will have their Student Academic
Progress set to “Not making progress.” This
determines the student ineligible for any sub-
sidized loans he or she received afterjuly 1,
2013, and interest on his or her pre—existing,

disbursed subsidized loans, would begin to .

accrue. ,,

As an example, Fedele said that the 150
percent standard would apply to a student that
is “...enrolled and majoring in a program that
requires 120 credit hours, however, bytaking
certain courses more than once and withdraw-
ing from others, the student has more than 180.
credits, has not graduated and is still enrolled
in classes.”

If this student has had his or her ﬁrst dis-
bursed funds from Subsidized Stafford Loans
beginning after July 1, 2013. The interest on

 PITTSBURGH Healthy U looks after students’
health, ﬁtness and well-being

For the student who forgets to take care of
health needs once ‘classes are in full swing,
Pitt offers a program to help monitor stu-
dents’ physical and mental well-being.

The Healthy U program is an initiative
that involves integrating health and wellness
into the routine life of the student. The initia-
tive is broad and focuses on eight dimensions
of wellness which include physical, emo-
tional, intellectual, social, occupational, en-
vironmental, spiritual and ﬁnancial health.
Marian Vanek, Pitt’s director of Student
Health Services, said the Healthy U initiative
intends to improve the physical and mental
well-being of Pitt’s student body. .

“We know that the health of an individual
student affects more than just his or her
physical and emotional well—being,” Vanek
said in an email. “Research has shown it may

' also inﬂuence academic performance and

the overall student experience.” A

"Vanek noted that Healthy U emphasizes
taking charge of one’s own health. The ini-
tiative offers numerous programs and ser-
vices to encourage students to make healthy

 choices.

Vanek said the incidence of obesity, high
blood pressure and Type 2 diabetes are at
an all-time high on college campuses. The

~ American College Health Association esti-

mates that three out of 10 college students
are overweight or obese.

Vanek said obesity is associated with
many other health problems, including
metabolic syndrome, a cluster of risk fac-
tors like high blood pressure and excess
body fat at the waist. Together, these risk
factors increase individuals’ risk levels for
serious health problems like diabetes, heart

disease and stroke.

“College students are also faced with a
unique set of stressors that may at times be
quite overwhelming,” Vanek said. “When
stressful experiences are greater than the
coping resources a student may possess,
problems arise.”

According to Vanek, students can de-

7velop simple habits that contribute to good

health. She listed exercise, breakfast, sleep,
hygiene and knowing one’s limits as easy
steps toward a healthy lifestyle.

Vanek said about 1,800 students at-
tended last year’s"Healthy U Fair, with 450
receiving ﬂu shots at the event. She added
that the ZooZilla 5K race on November 3 of
last year had more than 200 participants,
and about 85 percent of students on campus
are aware of the Healthy U initiative. The
next annual Healthy U Fair is scheduled for

a September 25, 2013.

The initiative involves collaboration be-

tween many University departments and

. _.-..._. -4.-- ~..«. .-..-..___..- , .-,~‘-_ ,-. ..._.A- .e-nu

dimensions such as the Counseling Center
and Intramurals and Recreation to provide
services and programs to students.

Among its many activities, Healthy U
offers classes in swimming, rock climbing,
aerobics and yoga through Intramurals and
Recreation Program. According to Intramu-
rals Director Marilyn Ross,.the classes are
offered at all levels.

Student Government Board members
Dave Rosenthal and Amelia Brause work
with Healthy U to provide incentives for
students to stay ﬁt and healthy. Brause’s
project with the initiative focuses on each
tenet of Healthy U for a month. The proj-
ect will kick off in the fall with yoga on the
Cathedral Lawn, an event targeted toward
spiritual wellness. Other months will focus
on ﬁtness, mental health and healthy eating.

Rosenthal said the details for each
month’s focus are still in the works. Along
with his work on Brause’s project, Rosenthal
organized and tested out a healthy cooking
class that a Sodexo chef teaches for students
in April and is working to devise aplan over
the summer to make the class more sus-
tainable. His aim is to have 5 to 7 classes
throughout each semester.

junior Brandon Benjamin attended
Rosenthal’s pilot food class in April.

“We were given information about what
to look for when buying herbs and spices,
how to prepare ingredients safely and ef-
fectively (e.g. cutting techniques, methods
for peeling and coring, etc.), and best of all,
a few recipes for delicious, nutritious foods
that can be made on a budget,’-’ Benjamin
said in an email. _

Benjamin, president of Rainbow Alli-
ance, said he was interested in seeing what
other types of classes Healthy U could of-
fer. He noted that the food class was not
time—consuming but still packed in a lot of
valuable information about food in a small
amount of time. -

“Healthy cooking is super important
because in college, it is too easy to fall into
the trap of eating cheap, convenient meals
from fast food restaurants or dining halls,”
Benjamin said.

Benjamin felt that the food classes will
help students be healthier and more self-
sufﬁcient. 1

“I would be interested in seeing occa-
sional classes on g1uten—free or low sugar
recipes for students with certain dietary
concerns, as these are prominent issues fac-
ing many college students,” Benjamin said.

Vanek said that Healthy U will make a
lasting difference for students who take
advantage of it. i

“The college years can be quite stress-
ful so adopting healthy behaviors early on
is important and these good habits can be
carried into one’s adult life following gradu-
ation,” Vanek said. I

these disbursed subsidized loan ﬁinds would
now start to accumulate against the principal
balance of the loan.

A transfer student would be held under the
same conditions after their transfer credits
and their previous academic programs were
taken into consideration, added Fedele.
U.S. Department of Education spokeswom-
an Jane Glickman said that the longer—term
policy in Obama’s proposed budget “better
reﬂects the favorable economic conditions
facing borrowers that keeps interest rates
from doubling on July 1st and keeps rates
low over the next years.”

    

She also said that the Administration will
work with Congress, colleges and students to
decide upon a policy that is “...fair and ﬁscally
responsible, beneﬁts more borrowers, and
does not fund deﬁcit reduction on backs of
students and families.”

The Republican Party’s budget, “The Path
to Prosperity: A Blueprint for American Re-
newal,” Rep. Paul Ryan, R—WI, proposed in
March 2012, said that providing ﬁnancial
aid to students doesn’t help to make higher
education more affordable. The budget says
that “the decisions of colleges and universi-
ties to raise their prices would have been
constrained if the federal government had
not stepped in so often to subsidize rising
tuitions.”

Requests for personal comments from
Ryan on the budget and questions concerning
the Federal government’s involvement were
instead directed to the Committee on the
Budget’s press office, the committee which
Ryan is chairman of, who referred to the
budget’s footnotes.

The budget’s footnotes said that pub-
lic in—state tuition and fees fora four—year
university have risen 5.6 percent per year
between the 2001-2002 academic year and
the 2011-2012 year, and federal ﬁnancial aid
have increased 140 ‘beyond the rate of gen-
eral inﬂation in the same period. The budget
said “failing to address these problems will
jeopardize access and affordability to higher
education for America’s young people” but

  

   
 

  
  

 

did not go into further explanation.

According Sen. Pat Toomey, R—PA, tuition
has increased by 136 percent over the last
20 years. Meanwhile, more than 50 per-
cent of recent graduates are unemployed or
underemployed. Instead of borrowing $6
billion for a temporary extension with limited
beneﬁts, he said, Congress should focus on
issues that affect students and other young
people like the rising cost of higher educa-
tion, “unsustainable” government debt and
scarcity of jobs. '

The Democrat Party’s budget, “Jobs,
Growth, and a Stronger Future,” said that
the party plans to prevent an interest rate
increase and “...ensure greater access to a col-
lege education, and accommodate additional
student aid reforms that increase college
affordability and completion.”

Alex Miller, a spokesman for Sen. Bob
Casey (D-Pennsylvania), said Casey is com-
mitted to preventing interest rates from dou-
bling and is working with other members of
the Senate HELP Committee on the matter,
promising to closely review all legislation
that comes before the Committee.

Fedele said in an email that Pitt’s Office
of Admissions and Financial Aid has not re-

ceived any inquiries pertaining to the Stafford i

Loan interest rate rising to 68 percent on
subsidized loans, and is unable to predict how
an increase in the interest rate would impact
the amount of enrollments the university is
expecting tolreceive for the 2013-14 school
year. According to Fedele, OAFA is moni-
toring the situation, but appears optimistic.

“Because the increase in the interest rate
affects only subsidized loans (unsubsidized
loans were not lowered), and subsidized loans
do not accrue interest while the student re-
mains enrolled at least half-time, this change
in interest rates reverting back to the original
6.8 percent does not affect students until they
enter repayment,” Fedele said. I

“It was a good bonding experience to get
out of the dorm and do something together,”
Frese said.

She said the only downside is that there is
only one bus that goes directlyfrom Oakland to
Southside Works. Frese said that half the time
she ends up crossing the Hot Metal Bridge on
foot instead of waiting for the bus to show.

Ryan Comey, a resident ofYoungstown, Ohio
but a frequent visitor to Pittsburgh, said that
South Side is one of the city’s liveliest neigh-
borhoods. P 1

He said one of his favorite places to go is
Jimmy D’s, alocal bar and nightclub, but he also
enjoys going to the different bars on the street
and joining the herd of people walking around
from place to place.

Being in his late twenties, Comey said that
although South Side tends to be geared toward
college students, it still offers avariety of enter-
tainment choices. .

“That’s always a good thing because you have
more than one option,” Comey said. I

Beautiﬁcation project aims to make Bates Street more appealing

Elizabeth Furiga
Staﬁ Writer

Eugene Myers recalled the ﬁrst time he no-
ticed the ugliness of Bates Street several
years ago while commuting between his
home in Shadyside and the UPMC Sports
Rehab Center in South Side.

“It was winter, all the leaves had fallen
and the poor condition of the slopes was
revealed,” he said in an email. “Fallen trees,
vines clinging to the telephone wires and
plenty of miscellaneous rubble, [it was]
shameful.”

Luckily for Myers and other Pittsburgh
natives who are concerned with the street’s
appearance, a solution is underway.

The Oakland Planning and Development
Corporation worked in the Bates Street area
in early May to begin implementing a-beau-
tiﬁcation project that has been in the works
since 2009. Its leaders say the ongoing proj-
ect will continue into the fall.

The project, which was jointly developed
by the OPDC and the Western Pennsylva-
nia Conservancy, started in February and is
scheduled to be completed within two years.

According to David Zwier, the OPDC
program manager, the WPC worked with
the OPDC to identify areas of Oakland for

improvement in 2009. During the initial -

project they identiﬁed a corridor of Bates

Street and began a beautiﬁcation project in

. ioé$;"»Ji§..;a tags. 1;;

February once they received funding.

The area, one of the “main gateways into
Oakland,” was targeted in order to alter
perceptions of the neighborhood upon entry.

“Having a positive-looking entrance will
change how people think about the neigh-
borhood,” Zwier said. V

The ﬁrst step in their project was to
remove the invasive species of plants that
cover much of the slopes along Bates Street
so that OPDC and volunteers can plant more
pleasing vegetation. Such species, like hon-
eysuckle, grapevines and the Ailanthus tree
disrupt the environment, dominating other
species without any natural predator of their
own.

Myers works with visiting doctors who
come to train through observing operations
at UPMC. Myers noted that when these doc-
tors arrive in Oakland by the Bates Street
gateway, the ﬁrst sight that greets them is
that of an overgrown and ugly area. Accord-
ing to Myers, many visiting physicians have
called the appearance of the area deplorable.

Compelled to act, Myers began discus-
sions with representatives of the WPC. He
also contributed an undisclosed amount of
money from his own pocket. The money paid
for a pilot project to plan for the rehabilita-
tion of the slopes. Myers aimed to reduce
the area’s unsightliness and "stabilize the
slopes against erosion, a potential danger.

He’d hoped the completed model would act

as a model for other corridors in the city.

The project gained further support when
UPMC and Pitt made the decision to join
Myers in funding the project.

“We met with [Vice Chancellor of Com-
munity Outreach] Renny Clark from Pitt and
[Vice President of Community Relations]
Sean Logan of UPMC who could see the im-
portance of this corridor which links Pitt and
UPMC with important entities such as the
McGowan Center for Regenerative Medicine
and many important corporate headquarters
in the industrial park,” Myers said.

He said he met several times with Clark
and Logan and that the two ofﬁcials con-
sidered Bates Street an important corridor
because it connects Pitt and UPMC with the
McGowan Center for Regenerative Medicine,
which is located in South Oakland.

According to Clark, he and Myers met
to discuss the project, ways to implement
the changes and ways to involve Oakland
organizations such as Pitt, UPMC, the West-
ern Pennsylvania Conservancy,,the Oakland
Task Force and the OPDC in the project.

Yael Engel, a senior majoring in sociology
and anthropology, resides on Bates Street.
Engel said the appearance of the street
“should be made to look aesthetically nicer.”
This, she said, would encourage more foot
traffic to the South Side.

“I think that it seems pretty desolate with
not-very-nice-looking houses and build-

ings,” she said.

Volunteers gathered on the slopes of
Bates Street on May 8th and 9th, planting
trees and pounding in stakes. The trees will
form a new landscape and prevent erosion.

Judy Wagner, senior director of Com-
munity Gardens and Green Space program
at the Western Pennsylvania Conservancy,
said the project is ongoing and there was no
timetable for its completion.

“There’s a section to be done in the fall.
It doesn’t look all done right away because
it isn’t,” Wagner said.

Long-time residents, including Oakland
native Pam Sisco, have enthusiastically
volunteered to help with the restoration
project. ,

‘‘I’ve lived here for thirty years,” Sisco
said. “I think some new trees will make
[Bates Street] look nice. I looked around to
get involved with a local organization and
the green team made sense.”

Tom Meisner, a Pitt graduate, said the
Bates Street beautiﬁcation project is a step
toward a‘ more environmentally friendly
Oaklah/<31.

“I’m committed to improving my envi-
ronment. [I have been committed] since my
science classes gave an Earth Day assembly
in 1960,” Meisner said. “Everything like this
helps. Every bit helps.” I --

STRIP

like he or she owns some of the Strip District.

Uhl said that in the late 19th century, the
steel industry went from what Uhl called a
“craft industry” to mass production. This
increased the need for cheap labor and an
inﬂux of immigrants, especially from Eastern
Europe, arrived in Pittsburgh to work in the
mills. These immigrants gave the Strip Dis-
trict an international ﬂavor that lingers even
today.Ebraheim Salem, whose family owns
Salem’s Market and Grill, a Halal market and
restaurant, said that the Strip District is one
of the best areas in'Pittsburgh for business.
He pointed out the preponderance of other

international markets, including Wong Fat
Hong Oriental Food Market and Lotus Food
Market in addition to his own family’s.

Although Salem’s family originally owned .

a smaller location near Pitt’s campus on Bou-
quet Street, they bought their location on
Penn Avenue in 2007. Although they kept
the Oakland location, they bought and then
renovated the Strip District location, which
had previously been a ﬁlm—processing plant,
and opened it in 2008.-

While other neighborhoods struggle with
traffic congestion on streets that are barely
wide enough for one car, the Strip District’s
past life as a manufacturing center ensured
that the neighborhood could handle a high
volume of trafﬁc. The Strip District’s streets

are wider than those in many other parts of
the city, originally because they needed to al-
low transport of raw materials and products
to and from the factories and warehouses
there.

Salem, citing statistics that more than
20,000 commuters travel along Penn Avenue
every weekday, said that the location of the
Strip District ensures that large numbers of
customers pass by the businesses there.

Harper agreed, saying the liveliness in the
Strip District and feeling of a shared experi-
ence in the neighborhood made it a memo-
rable place to visit.

“It just seemed like everything there was
really authentic, like it was the real Pitts-
burg ,” she said. I

PITT ARTS

Since the launch of the program in 1997,
Clippinger has seen student participation in
cultural opportunities grow exponentially.

' “With about 5,000 Pitt students reached
in the ﬁrst year, it was considered a great
success. Now we reach over 50,000 Pitt
people, including repeaters. The growth and
development of the program has been
phenomenal,” said Clippinger.

Through research into the program, Clip-
pinger has seen direct links between Pitt Arts
and students’ appreciation of the arts. She
has also seen a link between the program and
students’ satisfaction with the University.

“Students who attend Arts Encounters
with us become really engaged with the arts,

often to the point of becoming aﬁciona-
dos. When we survey students about their

experiences, we learn that getting con-
nected to the arts and culture in Pittsburgh

encourages students to stay at Pitt and
complete their studies here. In addition,
students deﬁnitely grow as people through
their contact with arts and culture,” said
Clippinger.

In addition to the veteran art organiza-
tions that have worked with Pitt Arts in the
past, the program will be offering new events
for the 2013-2014 school year, including the
Festival of Firsts, which will offer edgy and
unusual performing and visual arts .

For many students, Pitt Arts is the ﬁrst
step to a lasting appreciation of the arts.
Allie Musto, a senior chemistry major, has
been to at least 10 Free Arts Encounters.
Musto discovereda new passion through
the program, and is now experiencing her
newfound love in her personal travels.

“I think Pitt Arts is great because I would
never have been going to all this "stuff if it
wasn’t available. I found out I love opera,
and now I’m in Italy, so I will be going to one
here,” she said.

Pitt Arts connects students to the city’s
art and culture scene, but it also connects
students with similar interests. Amy Moli-
toris, a senior biology, psychology and reli-
gious studies major, who has been working
as a host for Pitt Arts events since the fall of
2011, sees ﬁrsthand the cultural and social
beneﬁts of the program.

“I love meeting new people on Pitt Arts
events. I have made many friends over the
course of several years, and I love discussing
plays, operas and musicals,” she said.

Most students who try out a Pitt Arts
event become hooked, and keep coming
back for more. Lindsey Everhart, a senior
civil engineering major, started using the
program as a freshman and has attended
-about 20 Free Arts Encounters since then.

“My favorite events are usually the sym-
phony orchestra concerts, but I went to a
jazz concert last year that was phenomenal.
It’s been a really great program and allows
students on a budget access to things that
are normally too expensive —— and the food
is good too,” Everhart said.

  Company estimates return on

 educational investments

Matt Singer
Stqff Writer

Based on recently tjgleased college rank-
ings by a wébsitethat measures return on

that they’re receiving a bang fortheir-buck.
For in-state students, Pitt is ranked

I ates’ return on investment, or ROI. When
7 measured alongside the other 437 public
universities ranked by Payscale and ac-
counting for in-state tuition, Pitt is 96th.
For out-of-state graduates, Pitt is ranked
at 375 out of 1,511. But some experts see
PayScale’s measure as only one way for pro-

' spective students to gauge whether they’re

making the logical choice by continuing
their education. 4 .
.PayScale is a company based in Seattle

mation and then aggregating it to sell to
_ companies through a software service. In
 recent years, it has broadened its output
T and has begun to publish its ROI listings. To
determine their college ROI list, PayScale
i takes yearly earnings data from the last 30

qualify as a self-reporter of their respective

have no morethan a bachelor’s degree.
PayScale’s researchers then add togeth-
er the median value of each year to reveal
30-year earnings. They then subtract the
weighted price of the school — tuition
andfees, room and board and books and
supplies — from the 30-year earnings. To,
account for the foregone wages a graduate
could’ve earned if they had opted not to
attend college, PayScale ﬁnds the median
earnings for high school graduates and
adds them up for 34 to 36 years to account
for time spent earning a salary instead of
paying tuition, and then subtracts it from
the difference between the 30-year earn-
iings and the weighted price of the school.
PayScale recognizes the resulting ﬁgure
}as the median return a student can expect
from a given institution. '.
For their estimations of room and
board cost, PayScale chooses to use on-
campus housing to determine the cost ofa
school’s room and board. They also crunch
the numbers to provide two separate rank-
ings for public universities — such as Pitt
—— to provide different rankings for in-
state and out-of-state students.

Katie Bardaro, the lead economist and
director of analytics at Payscale, said in.
an email that the information company
believes that it’s important for students to
be able to consider their ROI when making
their college choice.

“There are numerous factors that go
into this decision process, both qualitative

(e-gé, learning opportunities, dorm life,

investment, Pitt students can be assured i

. 312 out of 1,511 colleges in terms of gradu- T

and began by crowdsourcing salary infor- ,

years reported to them from graduates. To .

data, graduates must work full-time and ‘

availability of extracurriculars, etc.) and
quantitative and we are simply providing
a piece of this puzzle,” she said. “The gen-
eral conclusion we hope people can draw
from the ROI package is not all schools are
a good investment for all students. There
is a range and people should be aware of

3 this before they make a bad investment.”

While Pitt’s ratings on PayScale.com in-
dicate a positive ROI, prospective students
shouldn’t rely on the website’s rankings
and methodology alone when weighing
their college options. Hannah Morgan, CEO
of CareerSherpa.net and contributer to the
U.S. News & World Report, said PayScale.
com’s data shouldn’t beithe deciding fac-
tor for a student who’s in the process of
deciding which college to attend.

“It is widely believed that most of these
salary data sites are not 100 percent ac-
curate, and therefore, [they] should only
be used as one data point, not as a single
or absolute source,” Morgan said. A‘

PayScale doesn’t account for individual
ﬁnancial aid packages, relying instead on
the average value of grant aid given to stu-
dents of a speciﬁc school. In order to ﬁnd
this value, Payscale uses, the average sum of
local, state, federal and institutional grant

paid a student receives, as reported in the
-Integrated Postsecondary Education Data

System, a data collection program within
the Department of Education. 
Troy Onink, CEO of Stratagee, a com-
pany based in Russell, Pa., that provides
ﬁnancial planning services to families try._-
ing to ﬁgure out how best to pay for college,

-said that PayScale’s ﬁndings may not be
A true for all students.

PayScale’s ﬁndings seem to be “reliable
to the degree that the data they use is reli-
able,” Onink said.

In 0nink’s opinion, results based on
variables equated as medians or averages
may skew rankings in a way that makes
them less useful to students when highly

_ individualized factors absolutely must be

taken into account. For example, ﬁnancial
aid packages tend to vary a great deal from
school to school. _ﬁf"'
According to PayScale’s website, the
company can predict with 90 percent con-
ﬁdence the 30-year median salary for grad}-
uates from most large institutions within
a margin of 5 percent. But even this rough
estimate of, graduates’ expected incomes
only applies to certain graduates. Its" 
come estimates also do not include alumni
who go on to postsecondary programs. 5';
Because statisticalpredictions require
large sample sizes, PayScale’s predictions
are more precise for larger institutions. For
smaller schools and elite universities, Pay‘-
Scale predicts the median salary ofgraduié
ates within a margin 10 percent above

Running routes’ accessibility increased fr today's

Parthena Moisiadis
Staff Writer

As an undergraduate student at Pitt 10
years ago, Sarah Rossbach didn’t know
where she could go to run.

Rossbach, an active member of the run-
ning group People Who Run Downtown,
said that although there weren’t any run-
ning clubs for students at Pitt at the time,
she navigated the city on her own in order
to ﬁnd routes she enjoyed and thatmade
her feel safe.

But since Rossbach graduated, there

have been many ‘developments in ways
students can become involved in running
on campus.

Samuel Vescovi, Recreation Sports Co-
ordinator at Pitt, said that his office has
implemented a new training program for
runners in order to bring students together
in preparation for races.

Although this group of runners, known
as the Pittsburgh Running Crew, began as a
means to train for the Pittsburgh Marathon,
which was occurred May 5 this year, Vescovi
said that the group will broaden its focus
in order to provide a year-round group for

students who are not necessarily training
for a marathon.

Vescovi said that the group is composed
of about a hundred students who run four
or ﬁve times a week in smaller groups.
A student volunteer leads each of these
groups, which are based on pace.

For those who prefer to run solo, Vescovi

said that there are also running routes stu-
dents can access through their smartphone
or computer. '

Students can access a link on the Pitt
Recreational website (recreation.pitt.edu)
that will highlight running routes from

campus. All routes have a starting point at
either the William Pitt Union, the Hillman
Library or the Petersen Events Center.
Although there are only about 20 differ-
ent routes saved on the database, students
have the option to log their own runs and

. share them with students. Vescovi hopes

that the number of running routes will grow
considerably with use. _ ’

On Pitt’s Recreational Sports website, a
number of routes are detailed through the

. application “Map My Run,” which includes

a number of Panther Pride routes, such as

the four—mi1'e run, which loops through '

Schenley Park and ends at the Carnegie
Museum of Natural History. T
He said the Recreation Department at

Pitt hopes to encourage students to use A
the website and log their runs by offer-

ing monthly awards for the students who

log their runs and have run the route the '
fastest. As of now, the department has not

began this effort. .
Of the routes the database now offers,
there are courses that range from one mile
to a full marathon. There are also a variety
of types of courses, including scenic routes
through Schenley Park and urban routes
through the city. ’ . ‘ «

International students adjust to student life, make friends at Pitt  

Danielle Fox
Staﬂ W riter

jinheejeon, who originally came from Seoul,
South Korea, in 2010 will study at Pitt this’
fall. But she did not have to wait for class to
begin before she learned her ﬁrst lesson:
Unlike the Americans she saw in movies and
on television, not every American carried a
ﬁrearm and got into shootouts.

“I thought every American was danger-
ous and exaggerated because of freedom of
guns and images in the mass media,” said
Jeon.

There are roughly 2,800 international
students like Jeon enrolled at Pitt each se-
mester from over 100 countries. The stu-
dents come to study at a U.S.schoo1, which
can make them more competitive at home
while also improving their English skills.
Most of the University’s international stu-
dents hail from China, with India, South
Korea, Taiwan, Saudi Arabia, Canada, Tur-
key, Iran, Brazil and Germany following,
in that order.

Despite her initial fear,]eon came to the
U.S. following her husband, who was accept-
ed to Carnegie Mellon University in 2009.
When ]eon’s husband graduated in'2o11,
he got a job in Pittsburgh, which greatly
excited the couple, who wanted to extend
their time in the U.S. .

Jeon will begin studying accounting at the
Katz School of Business this fall. She admit-
ted that she watched too many American
television programs and films before her
arrival in the U.S., which gave her the im-
pression that Americans were more violent
than they actually are.

“But, I’ve realized that I was absolutely
wrong,” saidjeon.

But for another student, the opposite was
true. Anna Reiter, who came to Pitt from
Augsburg, Germany to pursue a masters
degree in German Studies, said it was the
violent and impoverished side of American
life that she didn’t expected before she came
to the U.S.

Reiter described Augsjburg-=as'i.:  ' S V

Otherwise, Reiter, A
Pitt. She found that"si;)i'l:ietparts of American
curriculum are different from the German.
Despite her facility with languages, Re-
iter said it also took her some time to ﬁgure
out what Americans professors required of
their students as compared to what profes-
sors in her native Germany had required.
“I found that students wereexpected to
ﬁnd and also to justify a very individual ap-
proach to texts,” Reiter said. She added that

    

American students at the masters degree

enjoyed studying at l V

level are expected to explain very particu-
lar aspects that they had found interesting
and useful.

She had heard Pitt boasted small classes
and approachable professors, yet was sur-
prised by how busy she was once school
started and how encouraged she would be
to attend conferences and publish work.

Reiter retold a personally exciting mo-
ment of understanding in the classroom
when she discovered during her second
semester that, in America, students use
double-spacing when writing papers as op-

posed to the one-and—a-half spacing Reiter V 
had been using to write her 2o—page research I

papers in the ﬁrst term.

While Reiter, who speaks French as well
as English and her native German, hasn’t
struggled with taking classes in English,
other students struggle with the language
when they start at Pitt.

While ertain Pitt classes are difﬁcult for
Americans, non-native English speakers
are burdened with the additional hardship

of learning challenging subjects from a pro— 

fessor who isn’t speaking in the student’s
native tongue.

Jeon had studied English for 10 years
but said Americans don’t speak in the same
style that she had learned from textbooks.

To prove that they know enough English
to succeed atvPitt, international student ap-

plicants must submit their standardizedii  _  Without thishelp, Zhang might never

If a studentdoes not obtain the required

term or may be considered for a branch
campus instead of the Pittsburgh campus.

University recreational facilities bountiful across campus

Jeremy Tepper
stajffwriter

When new students embark on their aca-
demic journey at Pitt, a common concern
is where they can ﬁnd equipment to sat-
isfy their exercise needs.

Luckily, Pitt features a number of ac-
cessible and high-tech recreational facili-
ties all across campus.

There are 10 ﬁtness centers located
throughout Pitt’s campus. Among the 10,
seven are located within residence halls

and may only be accessed by the stu-
dents of those residence halls with a valid
Pitt ID. These include the Brackenridge
Fitness Center forresidents of Amos,
Brackenridge, Bruce and Holland Halls,
Tower A Fitness Center forresidents of
all three Litchﬁeld Towers, Lothrop Fit-
ness Center for residents of Lothrop and
Forbes Halls, Panther Hall Fitness Center
forresidents of Panther Hall, Pennsyl-
vania Hall Fitness Center forresidents
of Pennsylvania Hall, Sutherland East
Fitness Center forresidents of Sutherland

Hall—East wing and Sutherland West
Fitness Center forresidents of Sutherland
Hall——West wing and Ruskin Hall Fitness
Center for students living in Ruskin..
Each residence hall fitness center is
generally located in the lobby of each
building for easy access. Although each
facility differs, these seven ﬁtness center
are smaller in‘size, featuring a moderate
amount of treadmills, ellipticals and oth-
er basic ﬁtness equipment. Additionally,
some of these ﬁtness centers feature TVs

to keep students entertained during the-

UNIVERSITY OF
  

course of their workouts. Most of these
facilities operate all 24 hours of the day.

Pitt’s newest residence hall, Norden—
berg Hall,’ will also feature a brand new
ﬁtness center. According to Marilyn
Ross, Pitt’s Director of Intramurals and
Recreation, the hall’s recreational facili-
ties will_be “state of the art,” and similar
to the equipment featured in Panther
Hall. The ﬁtness center will include three
treadmills and two ellipticals among
other machines. The ﬁtness center will
include TVs, which are connected to wire-
less Pittnet. While working out, students
can plug their headphones in and easily
listen to and change the television. The
fitness center will be located on the third
floor of the building, overlooking the
garden area featured in the new Fifth
Avenue facility.

Besides those located within the resi-
dence halls, Pitt has three other ﬁtness
centers, which are located in non-resi-
dence buildings and are available for all
students to use. These include the Baierl
Student Recreation Center located inside
the Petersen Events Center, Belleﬁeld
Hall Fitness Center and Joseph C. Trees
Hall Fitness Center. '

According to Pitt’s_ website, Baierl
amasses 40,000 square feet and “fea—
tures a large collection of cardio equip-
ment, free weights and machines.” In
addition to fitness equipment, Baierl
includes racquetball and squash courts,
a group ﬁtness studio, a multi-purpose
room and a matted area for calisthenics
and stretching. Furthermore, there’s,a
health assessment lab, shower and chang-
ing rooms and locker rentals. Hours of
operation might change, but Baierl is
generally open from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. on
Monday through Friday and 10 a.m. to 10
p.m. on Saturday and Sunday.

Trees Hall, like Baierl, is another mas-
sive ﬁtness center. Among other things,
Trees includes three full-sized basketball
courts, a multi-purpose room, a dance
studio and nine racquetball courts. Trees
Pool, also part of the complex, includes
an 0lympic—size pool and a separate six
lane pool. Trees Hall is open from 7 a.m.

to 9 p.m. on Monday through Thursday, a

7 a.m. to 8 p.m. on Friday, and 12 p.m. to
5 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday.

Rounding out Pitt’s non-residence ﬁt-
ness centers is Belleﬁeld Hall. Belleﬁeld
has a number of facilities, including a
basketball court, a gymnasium, a four
lane lappool, ﬁtness center, weight room
and dance studio. Belleﬁeld is open from
7 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. on Monday through
Thursday, 7 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. on Friday,
and 12 p.m. to 5 p.m. on Saturday and
Sunday.

The 10 recreational facilities on cam-
pus offer Pitt students the opportunity
to enjoy ‘exercising and get in shaperfor

Writing Center employees are trained to
help students in every step of the paper writ-
ing process. A consultant will help make the
writing clear, point out grammatical errors and
ensure that the student has the best revisions
possible. The Writing Center is not there to
edit papers. Rather, the staffers work to help
students learn to catch common writing mis-
takes. Students can reserve atime to meet with
a consultant by reviewing an online schedule
or calling the office to set up an appointment.
The Writing Center also hosts the Writers’ Café,
where students interested in creative writing
can have their work informally Workshopped.
It also provides a dissertation boot camp —

RUNNING

for running and biking. .

“You can run from Pittsburgh through
Lawrenceville and Highland Park. You can
go for miles on top of miles to Squirrel Hill,
Heinz Field or Station Square,” he said.

Hannah DeCleene, a senior and the pres-
ident of the student running club Panther

Strides, said that she actually learned her
way around the city by running. “There
aren’t many areas unreachable by foot in
Pittsburgh,” she said.

Vescovi said that one of the advantages
to being a runner at Pitt is that the runs
never become repetitive.

“You run from one neighborhood to the
next and see excitement everywhere you_go.
Sometimes it’ll make you not want to stop
and make you keep going,” he said.

Rossbach said that she also enjoys the
variety of running routes the city offers.

“I really love mixing it up,” she said. “De-
spite the hills, it’s easy to cover a group of
neighborhoods in one run or over a week
of running.”

Rossbach said that it is easy to venture
to these neighborhoods from Pitt’s campus.
She said that all the trails in Schenley Park
connect to the Eliza Furnace Trail. L

“From there you can go all around the
city and‘ even connect to far—reaching points

. if you’re running long distances,” she said.

Rossbach said that these trails are best
to run on because they are ﬂat and unpaved.
She said that the trails are made of crushed
limestone, which is easier on your feet,
knees and joints. ’

Even when not using running trails,
Rossbach said that Oakland itself iscon-
ducive to runners because of itswide side-
walks. - ' - K K

While concrete is the most damaging
surface to run on, Rossbach said that you
can run on every surface as long as you are
running properly and have good form and
attire. V

Rossbach also said that even though the
weather in Pittsburgh is .not always ideal for
running, students should try to keep run-
ning outside because it’s possible.

“Make sure shoes have good tread on

extremities warm,” she said.

Rossbach said that it is most beneﬁcial to
run with a group during the colder months

: in order to keep motivated.

DeCleene agreed that running with oth-
ers is helpful during bad weather. “It’s easy
to lose motivation andlbecome a lazy blob
in the winter, but having fellow runners
who are willing to take on the bad weather
with you helps you get out there under any
conditions,” she said.

Rossbach said that running with a group
is not only a good way to socialize, but also
a good way to keep‘ healthy. '

“When you’re a student, running is easy
and cheapto ﬁt in around your schedule.

-It’s good for your wallet, and mental and
physical health, and there are a lot of ways
to get into it in Pittsburg ,” she said. I

Study suggests link between
religion, environmental

Raechelle Landers
For The Pitt News

A study published in early May found that
U.S. citizens expecting to “see Jesus in the
clouds next month” are less likely to sup-
port government policies regarding global
warming.

Former Pitt professor David Barker and
University of Colorado professor David
Bearce conducted a study, which appeared
online in May of last year and appeared in a
journal early this month in an article titled
“End Times Theology, the Shadow of the
Future, and Public Resistance to Addressing
Global Climate Change.” In it, they exam-
ined the link between Americans’ religious
views and whether they considered global
warming a priority for the government.

Barker, who left Pitt last December and
is now the director of the Institute for Social
Research at the University of California at
Sacramento, and Bearce used data from
surveys and polls the ‘Pew Research Cen-
ter took in 2007 to testwhether there was
any correlation between belief in Christian
end—times theology and reduced support
for policies aimed at protecting the envi-
ronment. _

In the study, the authors deﬁned Chris-
tian end-times theology as a literal inter-
pretation of the Bible as predicting the end
of the world. -

Among people who believe in climate

change, also believing in end—times theol-

ogy reduces the probability that a person
agrees with creating policies aimed at curb-
ving climate change by more than 12 percent,
according to the researchers’ analysis. It
also increases the probability of disagreeing
with government action aimed at curbing
climate change by more than 10 percent.

“[O]ne can see that a belief in Christian
end—times theology signiﬁcantly predicts
resistance to government action aimed at
curbing global warming,” they wrote.

But Pitt professor Kristen Tobey, who
teaches religion and law for the Depart-
ment of Religious Studies, disagreed that
Barker’s and Bearce’s conclusion applies to
all Christians. She works with a group of far-
left Catholic anti-nuclear activists who call
themselves the Transform Now Plowshares
movement, in reference to a passage in the
Book of Isaiah that prophesies that humans
will cease waging war against each other.

The activists’ religious faith makes them
feel more responsible for the Earth’s envi-
ronment, according to Tobey.

. She also said that the activists don’t
have an explicit end-times theology and

still think it is important to take care of '

the planet. .

“They certainly do not feel that God’s ul-
timate power and authority remove the need
for human action,” she said. “Their theology

focuses more on human responsibility in
the here and now, rather than end times.”

Members of Transform Now Plowshares
could not be reached for comment at time
of publication. ~

But for some Christians, end—times theol-
ogy may be more inﬂuential in their views
on environmental policy than Tobey sug-
gested.

Rep. John Shimkus of Illinois serves as
the chairman of the Subcommittee on En-
vironment and the Economy, which falls

« under House Committee on Energy and

Commerce. In 2009, Shimkus read from
the Book of Genesis during a hearing of the
subcommittee in order to prove that “God’s

word is infallible, unchangeable, perfect.” _

“The Earth will end only when God de-
clares its time is over, man will not destroy
this earth,” Shimkus said.

The French Tribune considered Shim-
kus’ interpretation of the Bible as typical
of Americans, and understood Barker’s and
Bearce’s study as a particularly damning
critique of politics in the United States.

“As per a study done by David C. Barker
of the University of Pittsburgh and David
H. Bearce of the University of Colorado,
U.S. [sic] administrations failed to curb the
problemof climate change as they were un-
able to initiate any aggressive policy action,”
the author of the French Tribune article,
which appeared online May 4, wrote. “The
study also reveals its reason [sic] that a large
number of Americans believe in religious
doctrine and takes a fatalistic attitude to-
wards future.”

Emails sent to the various addresses list-

ed online for the French Tribune prompted
messages from Internet servers, indicating
that emails could not be delivered to those
addresses.

Barker disagreed with this interpretation
of his ﬁndings, saying that his research does
not indicate that all American environmen-
tal policies are based on religion. Barker
said that “economic concerns are more
important roadblocks to action on global
warming than religious beliefs” and that
the purpose of the study was to illustrate
that a religious inﬂuence is merely present.

He said in an email that he and Bearce

V concluded that while end—times beliefs make

an important contribution, but this belief
is “far from the most important consider-
ation.” Because 76 percent of Republicans, a
signiﬁcant majority of them, are end-times
believers, it is difﬁcult for anyone in the
government to effectively change global
warming policy.

“Our political institutions are set up in
such a way that if a majority within one
party really doesn’t want something it [is]
hard for the other party to ‘ram it throug ,”’
Barker said in an email. I V

below the estimated value.

Bob Atkin, a clinical professor of busi-
ness administration at Pitt’sjoseph M. Katz
Graduate School of Business, said in an
email that college rankings, such as those
released by PayScale.com, help prospective
students identify the strengths and weak~
nesses ofindividual colleges.

“There are a huge number of choices
for college education. And it is extremely
difﬁcult to get deﬁnitive information about
what is the best college for a particular
student at a particular time,” Atkin said. “I
believe this is exactly why we have seen the

 

    

healthy lifestyle.

 

rise in the importance of ‘ratings’ —— name-
ly, to provide the consumer with some way
of sorting all the ‘stuff’ out there.”

In Atkin’s opinion, the ROI approach is
“just another such mechanism.”

“I would not base a college selection
on an ROI ranking, or any other ranking
for that matter,” Onink said in an email.
“What’s more important is where you can
get accepted to college, how you will pay
for it and what you will do with that edu-
cation.”

For current students, PayScale’s‘ report
isn’t meant to indicate an indisputably
promised return on the investment they
made in choosing to go to a college. Bard-
aro said the ROI for individual students

depends on a number of factors.
“The ROI one gets from education de-
pends upon their school choice, their major

choice and their inherent ability. There— I

fore, each speciﬁc person’s ROI will be
unique,” said Bardaro, noting that students
themselves play a role in projected ROI.
Bardaro acknowledges that even
though Pitt’s ranking ~— which puts it in
around the top 20 percent of all schools
listed and the top 22 percent of all public
schools — is a “great place to be,” their
report’s ROI ﬁgures should serve as a guide
rather than a guarantee to students that
they will receive a salary of a certain value

‘ later in their life.

Onink said ultimately the ROI for in-

dividual students depends on the amount
of time they’re Willing to invest in their
college experience. .

“I think Pitt provides a great bang for
your buck regardless of what PayScale.com
says. Getting a bang for your buck at any
college starts and ends with the students,”
Onink, who considers a college’s ROI to be
measured in more than dollars and cents,
said in his email. “It’s up to the students to
avail themselves of all the university has
to offer, while paying for that education
as wisely as possible.”

Onink praised Pitt for offering what he
considers to be a “wide variety of excellent
educational opportunities that lead to jobs
and excellence within a field,” but stated
that although students should be proud
of their choice to attend the University,
“each person will look at their return on
investment at Pitt differently.”

Atkin said the best use of PayScale’s
ﬁndings may be to take its ratings into
account, but to evaluate schools in other
ways as well, such as during campus visits.

“Namely, the economic estimate doesn’t
capture all important data or implica-
tions,” he said, noting many of the on-
line comments that bemoan PayScale’s
rankings because they fail to account for
parts of the college experience that have
no ﬁnancially-measurable value, but are
nevertheless life—enriching. “Estimated

economic gain simply isn’t the only im-

portant criterion in life, but it is one very
important criterion?!

OPINIONS

THE ELLICITOR

Students should plan early to declare major, ensure less anxiety

Ellie Petrosky
Assistant Opz'm'0ns Editor

When I graduated from high school in 2011,
I knew exactly what I was going to major in
when I reached Pitt in the fall. 1, ladies and
gentlemen, was going to be an English major.

In my two years at Pitt, I haven’t strayed
from this plan, nor do I intend to.

When I told my adviser I wanted to de-
clare my major after only one semester in
college, she looked shocked, her mouth
agape. She told me that most students de-
clare after sophomore or junior year., but
I said I was positive that I wanted to major
, in English.

English is somethingl have always had
an interest in. Growing up, I read every book
I could get my hands on. I wrote an embar-
rassing amount of Harry Potter fanﬁction.
When I found out S.E. Hinton wrote “The
Outsiders” when she was 16, I strove to
outdo her by several years — but I failed.

Reading and writing were skills that had
always come easily and naturally to me, butI
often drowned them under the desires to be
a veterinarian (I realized I didn’t actually like
animals that much), forensic anthropologist

o

(I discovered bones actually freak me out),
and a medical examiner (Being in school
for the rest of my life didn’t appeal to me).

I had been playing with the idea of major-
ing in English throughout my high school
career, but one teacher made me decide
ﬁnally and deﬁnitely. _

The teacher I had for my advanced Eng-
lish class my junior year of high school, as
well as for AP English the next year, made
me realize that English was all I wanted to
do with my life. I wanted to have the same
passion for literature that he did. I wanted
to be able to discuss books and correlate
them with real life like he could. I wanted

(to make a difference through reading and
analyzing literature.

My advice to all new students rides on
this idea: Decide on a major or track as soon
as you can.

Declaring a major early in your college
career means that there is a lesser chance
you will have to take extra semesters, as you
spend less time testing the waters in many
different majors and classes and instead
spend more time working on the require-
ments for your major.

When I went to see my departmental ad-

viser to schedule for this coming fall, I was
informed that I was over halfway done with
the 120 credits required for graduation. This
means that I am on track to graduate in four
years. I owe this to having a plan before I
started college.

Figuring out your major early in your
college career has more beneﬁts than just
ﬁnishing school on time. Having a major
in mind gives your conﬁdence a little boost
as well.

You realize that you’re not going to be a
college “lifer,” attending school for forever
because, after six years in school, you STILL
don’t know what you want to be when you
grow up. You realize that you’re going to
actually have a career after you graduate
and not have to ring people out at Rite Aid
for the rest of your life. You come to terms
with the fact that you’re almost a grown—up
so much quicker when you have an end goal
in mind. You get to tell people that you’re
a "certain major when they ask, instead of
blurting out a sheepish, “I don’t know yet.”

This newfound conﬁdence transfers into

your schoolwork as well. Now that you know .

what you want to do, you do it well. You write

that paper ahead of time because you want it ’

  

    

 'r.r;mganf;;

:"r;aoagsmsrst

to be the best it can be. You study for weeks
for that exam. You decide that you’re going
to be successful after all.

If you put yourself on track to graduate
in four years, you will be saving money and
time you would have had to spend on extra
semesters, which makes your parents happy.
Instead, you will have that money and time
to start your graduate life with. Let’s be hon-
est, you’d rather spend that time looking for
and working a real job instead of sitting in
class,anyway. ‘

Of course, there is nothing wrong with
not being 100 percent suie of what you want
to major in or do after you graduate. Every-
one is different in what they want to do, and
especially in how long it takes them to ﬁgure
it "out. And that’s OK.

Deciding on a major before I ﬁnished
ﬁlling out my college applications has truly
given me a step up in my college experience.

I’m more level—headed, focused and am
pursuing a major that I’m deeply passionate
about. To me, that’s even more important
than ﬁnishing college on time!

Finding what fits: Everyone needs their own American Chemical Society

Christy Lampe
For The Pzit News

Pitt’s Student Activities Fair is as close to afeed-
ing frenzy as the University offers, and if you’re
anything like me, you’ll be right there in all the
chaos. I don’t know if it’s the free food, the ex-
cited swarm of students or the collections of
T—shirts you acquire simply for walking past
a booth, but I would get sucked into at least
10 clubs before I had even made it past the
infamous Posvar “death trap” (look up about

midway through the ground ﬂoor of the build-
ing. and you will know what I mean). I knew I
had absolutely no intention of attending the
weekly meeting for 90 percent of these clubs,
yet year after year, the emails ﬂooded my inbox,
reminding me of my lack of self— control. To this
day, I think I’ve unsubscribed from Pitt’s Gam-
ing Club on four separate occasions, but those
guys are relentless.

You don’t need to j oin 10 clubs to ﬁnd friends
on Pitt’s campus. In fact, I know plenty of people
who have friends and aren’t active in any clubs
on campus. Your email quota and your sanity

   

willthank you ifyou can abstain from signing up
for clubs en masse and learn from my mistakes.
Although it took me year or so, I eventually
became an active member in Pitt’s American
Chemical Society.

This group was the best form of networking
foranewly declared chemistry major. Iwas able
to meet friends in most of my major classes,
participate in volunteer work and have faculty
acknowledge me by my ﬁrst name. All of these
things are crucial to not only surviving the next
four years, but also thriving. Fm not advocating
joiningACS speciﬁcally, but I’m suggesting you

ﬁnd a club speciﬁc to your major and not only
join, but become an active member and take on
a leadership role.

Joining a club will surround yourself with
people of a similar major. Be it a question
the night before an exam, a group project or
someone to call for the notes when you miss
class,trust me when I say youwill need afriend
in your major sooner rather than later. Not to
mention there will be times when you’ll be so
frustrated with school you need someone to
vent to that actually understands and appreci-
ates your burden.

Most clubs also participate in some form of
outreach, which is awesome,especially if it’s in
your area of study or interest. For example, ACS
has several outreach events throughout the year
that involve helping nurture‘anappreciationfor
science in underprivileged school districts, but
I’m sure other departments have similar causes.
These are the types of experiences you’ll be able
to talk about in an interview that will differenti-
ate yourself from other potential candidates
when they ask dreaded questions like, “tell me
about atime you went above and beyond.’iA club
is your gateway to acing any interview.

Finally, all clubs are sponsored by some

. faculty member, most likely one that works in

the speciﬁc department. Additionally, many

_ clubs have faculty presenttheir research or

offer careerguidance to members of the clubs
during the weekly meetings. As a member, you
have a huge advantage over other students in
your major because you have the opportunity
to introduce yourselfto a professor and talk to

them outside the classroom. At one point in '

time, you may need a letter of recommendation,
and havingaprofessorthathasseenyou become
involved with a club, excel in their class and

V volunteer outside of school gives themastrong

foundation for any letter recommendation.

While the American Chemical Society pro— __

vided me with avast number of opportunities, I
do regret not joining a club outside of my major.

If I could have a redo and travel back in time ’

to my ﬁrst activity fair, I would still join ACS,
probably forgo the Pitt Gaming Cluball together
and would also join an additional club outside
of my area of study. This could be something

you enjoy, such as a running or skiing club,for ,

example. Your time is precious in college, but

it is important to your sanity to continue to do ‘
= - activities thatareﬁmforyou. By joiningthistype

of activity club, youwill surround yourselfwith
people who have similar interests while also

participating inwhatever activity you enjoy. You '

will simultaneously be meeting new people, and

. doing something of enjoyment — what’s not to

love about that combo?

Your time at Pitt is short, and though it may
not seem like it during midterrns, it does go
by quickly. Savor every minute of being a Pit
Panther, sing loud to Sweet Caroline and burn
your mouth with Antoon’s pizza. But most im-
portantly, remember to always do something
that makes you happy. Good luck! I

E?”

Nick Voutsinos
For The Pitt News

Welcome to the University of Pittsburgh: A
plethora of new experiences and opportunities
saw lie before you. Nowhere else do you have a
chance like this to better yourself, your future
and the lives of those around you.

The boundless independence now
in your possession has come to you at no extra
charge. It’s important to note that your tuition is
not only going toward your education, but also

for the experience, so take advantage of it. It’s
correct to conclude that the college experience
includes drunken nights ﬁlled with keg stands
and cheap liquor. But while these experiences
may improve your beer pong skills, nothing is
more enduring than what the many student
clubs and organizations can provide.

It is understandable that your new-
found freedom may be intimidating at ﬁrst.
There’s so much to do on campus, so how can
you possibly choose which club will look best
on your resumé? Attention: The student activity
fair may ﬁirther exacerbate this fear.

Here’s some advice when choosing a club
that will help you look the most attractive for
your future employer or for graduate school:
Don’t choose a club based on this rationale of
makingyourselflook “attractive.” It’s important
to make sure that you do not choose a club for
anyone other than yourself. Clubs are there for
you to pursue your own interests, and, if you’re
truly passionate about something, you can stand
out in the crowd.

Whatever your interests may be,
there’s avety good chance that there is a club on
campus that’ll be a your cup of tea.Just remem-

C ber that this isn’t your high school: With almost
r 30,000 students, it is probable, if not deﬁnite,

that there will be people on campus who share
your leisurely pursuits, no matter how eccentric
they may be. From club for Capoeira, a Brazilian
martial art that blends aspects of dance, ﬁght-
ing, and acrobatics, to the Pitt Outdoors Club,
you have a wide range of selections. 8

Nonetheless, even if you’re not ex-‘

tremely passionate about something, but you

U have always wanted to try a certain activity, go

for it. You have four years at Pitt: Take advan-
tage of the opportunities it gives you to experi-
ence things that were previously unavailable
to you. Take the Outdoors Club, for example.
This student-run organization offers activities
to both hardcore nature junkies and to people
who are new to the great outdoors. Either way,

It’s correct to conclude
tha't—the college experience
includes drunken nights
filled with keg stands and

cheap Hquon

I doubt that when you’re a postgraduate and a

member of the workforce you’ll have the time;

or the resources to go white water rafting.

So in the name of recreation, join a
club so that you may supplement your time at
Pitt with a variety of new experiences. If not

' for that, then join a club for the people. Once

you become a part of a club, you’re in constant
contactwith people who have at least one inter-
est in common with you. Consequently, many
friendships are spawned from clubs, and since
the student body at Pitt is as diverse as its club
selection, there are a lot of people to meet.
The students that you’ll encounter
through these various groups will encourage
you to try newthings and will help to give you_a
sense ofbelonging on campus. As I mentioned
earlier, Pitt can be intimidating, but actively
participating in a club with familiar faces will
give campus the appearance of being much
smaller. Your fellow members will contribute
to the passion that you’ll gain for your club,
and they will share your desire to make a dif-

g ference, or your desire to just make some great

memories. . A  .
That beingsaid, the experiences you
can have and the people you can meet are in—,

deed some of the most valuable things you can 8

gain at Pitt. While you’ll learn many things in
class, there’s still much to learn outside of the

classroom. These experiences outside of the
classroom will help you develop into a much
more consumate individual. Therefore, taking T

advantage of the opportunities clubs here at Pitt '

have to offer is not only beneﬁcial, but also es-

sential to having aﬁilﬁlling college experience.

The settingis nostalgic: As incoming
students enter the University and begin to
acclimate themselves with courses, peers

' and living situations, they will soon start to

realize the onslaught of student organiza-
tions channeling into Towers lobby, PR-ing
the sh*t out of each innocent bystander. All
judgment goes out the window as people
of all years are bombarded with anything
from colorful ﬂyers and business 'cards_to
invitations and novelties.

And once you pass up these colorful ﬂy-
ers, the free candy and the invitations, you
come out to Towers Patio to only see the
ground and garbage cans littered with the
very same materials. This only shows that
for one, the contact rate for these student
organizations is abysmal, and for another,
there is little importance given to these stu-
dent organizations.

This isn’t to shed a negative light on stu-

dent organizations, nor is it to insinuate
that student organizations that canvass are
lousy and obnoxious. Rather, it’s to note a
particular observation: One way students
can get involved —— a way in which Pitt ex-
cels in conducting — isn’t quite advertised
in this manner. And as a matter of fact, it’s
not advertised on as widespread of a student
level as it should be. What can be so reward-
ing and worthwhile for a Pitt student to look
into, but is not necessarily the ﬁrst thing
he or she is asked to investigate? Research.

Pitt produces an environment in which
students are able to pursue and discover
areas of study that are both challenging and
enriching. It’s recognized as a university that

excels in equipping students with opportuni-
ties to enhance their education and further
delve into their respective course material by
conducting that which it has been a pioneer
in for decades: research. _

Research provides students of all majors
and minors with a place where true learning
is witnessed.

A student with a politics or philosophy
interest who desires to learn further about

jpost-Soviet Union political transitions in

Eastern Europe can do so by applying for a
multitude of research grants offered through
the Dietrich School of Arts and Sciences,
the University.Honors College or speciﬁc
faculty members. For a student aiming for

a degree in neuroscience who might desire .

to study the LEMS disorder and ﬁnd ways
to increase the strength of communication
between neuronal connections can do so
by conducting research through academic
departments or in labs across campus. For a
student striving to be a mechanical engineer,
there’s a plethora of opportunities: Projects
that create affordable electric wheelchairs
for impoverished nations or aid in the dis-
covery of more efficient ways of delegating
trafﬁc during sporting events  Pittsburgh
with robotic trafﬁc assistants. g _
And those who conduct research here
at Pitt have seen how rewarding it can be.
The University boasts its accolades; three
Rhodes scholars in the previous ﬁve years,
top—ﬁve faculty ranking in biomedical re-
search, consistently ranked as a top public
research university and ranked the 12th hap;-
piest campus in the nation. Although these
are just a handful of accolades the University
has received, what stands most prominently
is a top-ranked public research university.

Start thinking logically in college, remove emotion from equation

X0 Naomi Borrebach

Columnist

Most of us get a lot of boilerplate advice
from parents, neighbors, counselors and
{other well-meaning adults when we start
i V lege. Along with that awkward moment
when a neighbor advises you not to party
too much when you’re just trying to get
your mail, many of you have likely heard
that you should, in no particular order,
take a wide range of classes, discover what

you’re good at, pursue your dreams and
enjoy your youth. Sounds familiar, right?

Your neighbors and relatives forgot
to tell you something important, if not
necessarily along the inspirational line
of most advice: In college, you should fo-
cus on not just discovering and building
up your strengths, but ﬁguring out your
weaknesses. Finding out what you’re not
good at can be instrumental in guiding your
decisions and focus in college.

—— probably more — things that we strug~
gle with. Knowing what you’re naturally
subpar at — be it organizing paperwork,
relaxing or watercolor painting —-can help
you ﬁgure out the best way to get through
college with minimal stress.

Although it sounds counter intuitive,
honestly knowing what you’re bad at will
help you to be successful in college by
helping you avoid pain and unnecessary
failure. While most advice focuses on tell-

I

ing people to do what they like and pursue
their dreams, I have seen a lot of people go
through a good deal of stress and unpleas-
antness when their dream major to get
their dream job involves skills or abilities
that they don’t have.

Another, andperhaps less harsh way of
stating this advice is to say that you should
seek to make practical, logical decisions
instead of emotional ones. While you might
dream of being a lawyer so that you can
wear a smart suit and help people with
your excellent legal advice, you don’t want
to have to revisit this idea after receiving
Ds in public speaking and writing courses.
Separating your emotion-driven fantasies
about the future, such aslawyer winning
cases effortlessly like they do on TV, with
a big salary to boot, from considerations
about what career paths might actually be
viable options.

Every student needs to know‘ their
weaknesses and strengths to be success—
ful in college: While the _stereotype goes
that everyone drops the pre-medical path
after failing organic chemistry, ,1 also know

people who have dropped their English

majors after failing writing classes. When

big parties, try to make friends in a less-
threatening way: by hanging out with
people on your dorm ﬂoor or joining an

COLUMN

 Rohith Palli
Coluwrmist

What is thought? William Golding, the author
of Lord of the Flies, attempts to answer this
question in his essay, “Thinking as a Hobby.”
Here, he conveniently triages thinking into
three grades: expression of sentiments, de-
tection of contradictions and construction
of truth.

Though a more nuanced perspective
is necessary, Golding’s position reveals a
compelling imperative in construction of
our educations: We must learn not only to
understand, analyze and check for internal
consistency, but to create as well.

The goal of a college education can’t
merely be to understand the jargon of a par-
ticular ﬁeld and to be able to ensure that work
others have done ﬁts within the prevailing
paradigms of a ﬁeld — we must learn to look
beyond the assumptions that others have
established and forge our own paths.

To these ends, our goal shouldn’t be to
complete curricula, but to gain an educa-
tion. If you want to gain knowledge about a
particular ﬁeld, taking as many classes in that
major as possible is the correct course of ac-
tion, but memorizing facts doesn’t constitute
an education.

As implied by Golding’s simplistic triage,

   

    ens!"

the important education at this stage is much
more about critical thinking skills than actual
“knowledge.” In today?s Internet age, any
fact can be looked up quickly without effort
or prior knowledge. Simple exposure may
increase the speed of such lookups, and com-
plete understanding of a ﬁeld grants insight
into the way that one goes about organizing

-‘s,

and constructing human knowledge, but
simply knowing things gets you nowhere.
Understanding, on the other hand, does.
The process of exploration that leads to
deeper understanding of a topic has been the
greatest skill I’ve honed as _a college student.
This is the process of thinking critically and
constructing a vision of the worldza kind of

   

  Point Park University

What is thought? Students must forge unprecedented paths

thinking that approaches thesconstructive-
-ness that Golding supposes Einstein exem-
pliﬁes.

Though learning facts can sometimes be
requisite to understanding a system or set
of concepts, these facts shouldbe kept in
context; they’re merely tools toward the ends
of self-improvement.

Facts stick better and we gain a better
understanding when we are more interested.
Thus, it is critical to take almost exclusively
classes in which you’re-interested. To this end,
though learning a single ﬁeld in a major grants
a perspective upo_n creation and organization
of knowledge, pursuing majors, minors or
certiﬁcates for the sake of saying you have
them is a bad idea.

Interests, not certiﬁcations, should be
pursued. No employer is going to hire a chem-
ist if his certiﬁcate is in children’s literature,
and no medical school is going to admit a
student if he has a certiﬁcate in conceptual
medicine, but both of these certiﬁcates are
perfectly legitimate avenues upon which to
improve one’s skills if they are of interest for
intellectual reasons. ' _

The same thing applies to courses. The

Want to increase your chances of graduating
college and having a successful educational
eigagrience? It’s easy to start right nowwith
a simple, yet drastic change in your lifestyle.
Start wearing clothing with attitude.
One of the reasons I love attending a col-
lege on the East Coast is the changing sea-
sons. This, in turn, gives us reason to craft
multiple weatherproof wardrobes for the

vast and often sudden temperature changes
in Pittsburgh.

While this may sound obvious, next‘

time you’re shopping for a trendsetting,
overpriced tank top, consider the “Attire
Attitude.”

Your entire attitude should be focused on
good grades, so the appearance and projec-
tion of your purchased attire should convey
a successful attitude. It’s time to start pro-
jecting success, and one way to do this is
by wearing it.

Before we can fully understand how to

do this, we need to make an assumption:
A college student wishes to be successful
in his or her education endeavors. We also
need to better deﬁne how our attitude can
be tied in directly to our attire.

Attitudes contain direction and inten-
sity. For example, let’s say a student enjoys
numbers and equations. The student’s at-
titude toward mathematics would evidently
be positive in this case. Let’s also say this
student wants to be a high school math
teacher. We can safely say that the student
has an intensely positive attitude toward

Sophia Al-Rasheed
For The Pitt News

As a nostalgic senior, I envy the position of
anyone reading this with more than one year
left at Pitt. I’m not going to reiterate what
you’ve heard over and over again, but trust
me, it goes fast. You’ll come across certain
moments ~—'the ﬁrst time you meet those that
will become your closest friends, the ﬁrst time
you try Sorrento’s pizza with ranch — that
you’d love to visit again. -

One experience that I am perfectly ﬁne
with leaving in the past, however, is my ﬁrst
day of school. It wasn’t exactly as bad my ﬁrst
day of high school (in sum: somehow that
single building was less navigable than Pitt’s
campus, and I underestimated what waiting
20 minutes for the bus would do to my hair),
but compared to the over—conﬁdent, conde-
scending senior status I held from the year
before, I’m not surprised that I have to a bit of
digging to ﬁnd it half—repressed in my head.

ine, for instance, started out on a rough
note —— I still hadn’t adjusted to the sounds
of living between Forbes and Fifth, which
combined with a lack of air conditioning in

Holland Hall left me waking up looking a little
less “I’m ready for the ﬁrst day!” and more “I
just woke up in the Sahara.” .

. he outﬁt was set though, a tradition I’ve
kept since I knew what the ﬁrst day of school
was. It followed basic guidelines— something
new, but not so new as to look like Iwas,un--
comfortable in it (it kills me that I still have
perfectly good recollection of articles from
Seventeen Magazine in my head). I took ev—
erything into account except for the heat that
my clothes would battle against — 17m not sure
how I forgot about this. '7’; y t _

iving close to campus freshman year would
have given me the advantage of having a short
walk to most of my classes, but my ﬁrst class,
a Spanish class, was randomly placed in the

' Victoria Building (which is a nursing building

, and I doubt ever held a Spanish class before).
It’s a bit ﬁirther than the Cathedral, but it
wouldn’t have been a bad walk + had I not
mistaken Forbes for Fifth, which apparently,
was a task that my overexcited brain decided
to pass over. V

through the bustling streets of Oakland, off
to meet my adviser and register for my Very
ﬁrst classes at the University of Pittsburgh.
Filled with both fear and excitement, I recall
looking up at the Cathedral and believing it
to be the symbol of a new chapter in my life.

My arrival at Pitt was through a passage
less common than most, but one quickly
growing in the number of people taking it
— I was a transfer student.

For us lucky few who start at a commu-
nity college or a different university, a feeling
of starting over is much too common. The
transition is rough for many, and I often
wished I had the advice of someone who
had already taken this path.

Throughout my last year at Pitt, I’ve
learned several lessons I ﬁnd valuable
enough to pass on to my fellow transfer stu-

dents starting at Pitt this year.Traditional
freshmen straight out of high schoolcan also
beneﬁt from one or two of these pointers.

1. General advisers: They generally give
you what you need.

They’re unavoidable. For many, that can
be both a blessing and a curse. On one hand,
general advisers are able to start you off okay
and prevent you from enrolling in classes
you’ll never need. On the other hand, gen-
eral advisers at Pitt generally have a poor
reputation and are known for doing just
that: leading people ‘astray. This may seem

counterintuitive, but don’t fret. Looking
deeper into this issue, it’s easy to discover
that this reputation isn’t totally deserved.

The key word to remember is general.
General advisers are here to give you, well, ‘-
general advice. As a transfer student,1I al-
ready had a good idea of what I wanted my
majors to be: premed and psychology, but I
had to go through the same process as many
incoming freshmen and meet with a general
adviser ﬁrst.

I had already accumulated credits,
though, and both my adviser and I were get-
ting confused about what I needed. I ended
up not retaking statistics, an important class
I needed my ﬁrst semester, and wasn’t able
to take a full course load the next since it
was a prerequisite to so many other classes a
in my psychology major. . .

The best decision I ever made was to
make an appointment with a department
adviser. Not only did she help smooth out
my class schedule, but she also had more

. in—depth knowledge of the ﬁeld I wanted to

go into and even the professors who taught
courses in that department. She also refered

, me to a pre-med adviser, who was someone

I had no idea existed and also had excellent
advice for me. - . .

For incoming transfer students and
freshmen: If you’re even remotely inter-
ested in a ﬁeld, make an appointment with
an adviser in that department. He or she
will be able togive you far more informa-
tion on what it will take to get you to your
career goals, and you can possibly avoid the
same situation that too many students end

up in — taking extra semesters to get there.

2. You’re not just a number, though it
often seems that way.

I remember this experience vividly: I I
had just started at Pitt and ﬁgured I could
just take the luxury of blowing off my larger
classes. I had, after all, just transferred from?
a community college where the classes were
small and attendance was generally part of
your grade. I ﬁgured I would take advantage

of this new found freedom to skip out on '

class whenever I felt like it.

However, not toofar into the semester
I became really ill and missed a quiz in my
chemistry recitation. I emailed the professor
that I needed to make up the quiz, and when
I read his response, I was shocked.

He began the email by asking me why I
hadn’t been attending his class — a lecture

‘ of at least two hundred people. I didn’t know:

how to respond, embarrassed and confused
by how he already knew who I was. Luckily,
he cut me some slack and allowed me to take
the quiz. Needless to say, I attended everyg
lecture from then on. , 
The moral of this story is simple: Go to if
class. These three words are most likely to
be the most ignored-words to come from
a professor’s mouth. Your friends may tell,
you that they did ﬁne in certain classes and:
only went on test days, but if you ever ﬁnd;

At ﬁrst glance, Oakland doesn’t
seem to be much of a cultural hub.
The busy Forbes Avenue is predom-
inantly spotted with chain restau-
rants, convenience stores and a
lone grocery store, the second-
ﬂoor IGA — none of which point
to anything besides an archetypal
American street.
But don’t get ahead of yourself:
That was simply the ﬁrst glance.
‘ﬁg Within the Oakland area there
are multiple ethnic grocery stores,
representing cultural enclaves
within the college neighborhood
that have caught the attention of
local residents and students alike.
“It is nice to come here and
see foods you are not going to see
other places,” says Alex Robinson,
a junior at Pitt, talking about Las
Palmas, the Mexican grocery store
on Atwood Street. According to
Robinson, Las Palmas’ “prices are

‘ Rbetter than places like Giant Eagle.”

if Ethnic grocery stores such as
Las Palmas might have been slow
in gaining praise from college stu-
dents, but as Robinson says, “[the]
word is getting out.” Known for its
outdoor taco stand, which attracts
many hungry late-night residents,

Further into Central Oakland,
on Bates Street, there is another
ethnic grocery store: Groceria Me-
rante, an Italian delicatessen that
has its roots in South Oakland.

Run by two sisters, Filom- ‘

ena and Julia Merante, the deli is
known for its fantastic sandwiches
and Italian meats. “What we en-
joy most is eating and cooking and
food ~— and sharing it with every-

one [sic] ,” says Filomena.

Being a part of the Oakland
community, which is home to many
universities, holds signiﬁcance for
the two sisters. “Kids need to learn
how to eat and cook on their own,”
Filomena says, stating further that
these are things “they can’t learn
at the university, and that’s one

reason why [she and her sister]

are here.”

The Allegheny and Monongahela
rivers ﬂow around Pittsburgh, ne-
ggotiating its contours before ﬁnally
meeting at the convalescence of the
Ohio River. The city’s rivers, a big
reason that “City of Bridges” has
eclipsed its older nickname “Steel
City,” are just part of what makes
«¢,Bittsburgh one of the country’s
most natural urban environments.
The Appalachian climate can
make it hard to appreciate all that
Pittsburgh has to offer in the way
of outdoor experiences and op-
liportunities. But having now lived
in Oakland for two summers, I, a
Boston native, have had the chance
to go on jogs through the shaded
trails of Schenley Park, over its

stone bridges and between the
oaks of Panther Hollow. Schenley
Park, a ﬁve-minute walk from the
Cathedral of Learning, also features
a golf course, ice skating rinks and
a swimming pool. When the cold ﬁ-
nally releases its grip on Pittsburgh,
you’ll see Flagstaff Hill peppered
with students taking a study break.

I’ve spent more than one af-
ternoon walking the valleys and
wooden slopes of Frick Park. Bird-
ing enthusiasts love to visit Clayton
Hill, where more than 100 species
of birds have been recorded. Chil-
dren ﬂock to the famous Blue Slide
Playground and learn about nature
at the Frick Environmental Center.
The park also features red clay ten-
nis courts, baseball ﬁelds and the
only public lawn bowling green in
Pennsylvania.

Much of Pitts

Kelsey Hughes
Staff Wrz'ter

In January, The New York Times described
Pittsburgh as existing for three reasons: the
Allegheny, Monongahela, and Ohio Rivers.
Initially, this was possibly truewhen the steel
mills were built around the powerful energy
sources. But now, perhaps the city’s personality
and strength come from its interconnectedness,
springingfrom the “streams” or roads that con-
nect the city’s neighborhoods together, making
Pittsburgh a vibrant place for art and culture.

While many other colleges are mini—com,mu-V
nities sectioned off from the outside world in a
campus bubble, Pitt is embedded in the urban
culture of Oakland and only a bus ride away
from all types of entertainment and outside-
the—classroom experiences.

Annabelle Clippinger, director of Pitt Arts,
said Pitt’s campus is bound to the city surround-
ing it. ‘

O “The city is our campus. We are in this
amazing, beautiful, urban campus and we take
advantage of everything the city has to offer,”
Clippinger said. .

With a multitude of cultural events to choose
from —- from the Pittsburgh Opera to the

- Duquesne Incline and everything inbetvveen —
Pitt students are able to take advantage of each
without concern for money. With one swipe or
ﬂash of a Pitt Student ID, students are able to
participate in a myriad of free events, as well
as receive free public transportation to each.

Sarah Honsaker, a senior psychology major
on a pre—med track says, “It’s pretty cool that
we’re one of the only colleges that offer free
transportation. It really helps to make our cam-
pus part of the city, allowing us the freedom to
explore Pittsburgh.”

Honsaker, like many Pitt students, is espe-
cially interested in the various art museums
around town. The Mattress Factory is one of her
favorite museums to visit. “It is always changing.
There are certain exhibits you can go see [con-

. sistently], and then there are different artists
that change it all the time,” she said referring
‘to the Mattress Factory’s in—residence artists.

 Honsaker serves as a First ¥ear Mentor to
*-incoming and current freshman. She and her

 fellow First Year Mentorsare available to give

advice and answer questions about collegelife
at Pitt. She believes‘ strongly in the motto of her

fellow mentors: “The main purpose in _,-Student I
” Affairs,” she said, “is to deliver the best 

~ dentexperiences. Idon’tthink.that  H
‘ without being involved outside of campusand
classes.” . ” A

‘‘It’s not a requirement,” Honsaker said. 

it really helps you enrich your understanding
-5 of the world we live intoday.” _ ,

Clippinger also stresses that partaking in

 these free cultural events is "a choice rather than

"‘ somethingforced upon Pitt students. But most

Pitt students do choose to participate in the free
events offered to them. Particularly, the PittArts
‘program — with about 6,000 students on its
mailing list and countless more beneﬁtingfrom
, it —— encourages students to ﬁirther appreciate

Summer, 2018 I The Pitt News I \/\/\/\/\/V.Dlllﬂ@WS.COm

the arts and culture that Pittsburgh has to offer.
Through free art encounters, museum visits
and discounted tickets, students can immerse
themselves in a‘ particular art scene for a few
hours, be it photography, painting, the opera or
a dance performance.While many students take
advantage of free museum visits, Clippinger ex-
plains that, “The free arts encounters are really
where it’s at. We book abus, we feed you dinner
and dessert [and] you get to go to aperformance
or [participate in a] hands-on experience.”
During the academic year, Pitt Students can
also visit a number of museums for free with

their Pitt ID: the Andy Warhol Museum, the
Carnegie Museums of Art and Natural History,
the Mattress FactoryArt Museum, Phipps Con-
servatory and Botanical Gardens, Senatorjohn
Heinz Pittsburgh Regional History Center, the
Fort Pitt Museum, Meadowcroft Rockshelter
and—Museum and Soldiers and Sailors Memorial
Hall and Museum. -

Whether you’re a botanicalenthusiast or
a stressed—out college student, Phipps — a
beautiful conservatory ﬁlled with displays of
ﬂowers, plants, and trees —- can serve as a se-
rene getaway. '

“Phipps functions that way for a lot d
people... [It] is a kind of decompression and
relaxation environment,” Clippinger said

If a student isn’t a big fan of exploring the
ﬂora, anotherfantastic place to escape from the
stresses of college life lies just across Schenley
Plaza. Stepping into 0akland’s Carnegie Lib I
of Pittsburgh, originally built in the early 1890s
with money from the famed industrialist An-
drew Carnegie, is in many ways like taking a
step back into the grandiose 19th century. The

John Lavanga
Impulse Editor

For many, the prospect of dating in college
creates an interesting conundrum. On the
one hand, you’re surrounded by thousands
of new people your age who are, in all likeli-
hood, just as eager to meet new people as you
are. On the other hand, you’re probably ﬂat
broke, and taking that potential new ﬂame
to Arby’s isn’t going to win you any points.
Here’s a list of some fun dates you can go
on in the city without taking out additional
student loans.

are always a great value. The Regent Square
Theater’s Sunday night showings, which are
careﬁilly selected cinema classics, are going
to be the safest bet, but don’t discount some
of the foreign films that come through town

When Joey Spehar, a co—host of WYEP’s

_ “Morning Mix,” comes home from a day
 of Djing and wants to listen to music, he
 doesn’t reach for an iPod orlaptop. Instead,
‘ Spehar grabs a vinyl record, places it on his

“It sounds more real. It sounds better,

 he explained.

At 29—years—old, Spehar may seem a little

— bit young to be relying solely on records for
 _ his life’s soundtrack, but a preference for
 vinyl record players has become a common

one among teens and twenty-somethings

 who are looking for an affordable, person-

Jerry’s Records? ownerjerry Weber views
record players as an absolute necessity for
today’s young music consumers.

“Young people should have a record
player to supplement whatever else they
have,” he said.

Owning records, he added, is a great way
for students to access music history, saying,
“Anybody who likes music should own a
turntable for the simple fact that there’s so,
60 years ofgood music out there on vinyl
that’s cheap.”

turn to record stores

When one pores over]erry’s robust col-
lection of records, which ranges from 
sical music to fusion jazz to rock staples like
The Band and Bruce Springsteen, it’s clear
that history has as much of a draw as the rela-
tive frugality of shopping at a record store.

But it’s not just the history, either. It’s
the search. On any given day, there’s an of-
portunity to stumble upon something truly
amazing in a record store. “You can come in
and not ﬁnd nothin’, and next time you walk
right over and there’s ﬁve records you’ve
been looking for for years,” Weber said. “If
you’re looking for some old funk or soul
or something, it does come in, but it don’t
stay long.”

For novice record store shoppers, Weber
has one piece of advice: “If you want some-
thing, carry it around until you’re ready to
go,” lest another shopper snap it up. Many
record buyers can relate to similar ch;3l—
lenges, as well as the joys of ﬁnding that
once—in-a-lifetime record. The disappoint-
ment of ﬁnding a rare Ian 8: Sylvia album and
then having it vanish is only surpassed by the
incredible joy derived from ﬁnally ﬁnding
a copy of Otis Redding and Carla Thomas’
King 8: Queen collaboration.

Ultimately, the excitement of ﬁnding
new albums and getting cheap records is
tethered to the sentimental nature of record

“Man Without a Country” by Kurt Von-

negut
The only lesson I’ve ever truly learned
jgtlife came from Kurt Vonnegut. Midway
through my freshman year, in a single dorm
in Lothrop Hall, I was having something
of an existential crisis. The Texas home
that provided comfort and familiarity for
me for 18 years was gone and the bridges
back were slowly fading as my all of my
friends were busy creating new homes and
familiarities. In its place was this foreign
land: Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where
people watched hockey and knew what
snow looked like. It was then, on a frigid
day injanuary, that I huddled in the corner
«aﬁmy room, Vonnegut’s “Man Without a
Country” in hand. I’d picked out the book
because the title resonated on what felt like
a spiritual level; at 18 I was a man by legal
deﬁnitions and hadn’t quite found a home.
In classic Vonnegut fashion, a single page
with a quote stood out: “I tell you, we are
here on Earth to fart around, and don’t let
anybody tell you different.” Since then I’ve
done just that. And in the confusing years
of college marked by landmarks in “self-
discovery,” that’s the most important thing

to remember.

“In Cold Blood” by Truman Capote

“Just remember: If one bird carried every
grain of sand, grain by grain, across the
ocean, by the time he got them all on the
other side, that would only be the beginning
of eternity.”

Written with desperate ferocity and de-
tail, Truman Capote’s “In Cold Blood” forces

you to turn the page like someone thirsty.

reaching for water. On a quiet November
night in 1959, a brutal tragedy rocked the
rural town of Holcomb, Kansas, where the
pious, virtually perfect Clutter family of
four was butchered in their sleep, effec-
tively eviscerating the American Dream.

Capote tells the story through the lens of

the aftermath -— the nationwide manhunt
and subsequent execution of Perry Smith
and Richard Hickock.

Capote became canonized in the liter-
ary world after the 1966 publication of the
“nonﬁction novel” (as he called it). The
story, which took four years in the lonely
plains of rural Kansas to research and docu-
ment, reads like a dramatic documentary’s
screenplay. And in an age where the genre
of investigative nonﬁction has lost con-
siderable clout to the unchecked hands
of memoir and free publishing, Capote’s
high terror thriller makes a strong case

And, although his actual presence never
takes stage, the highly publicized, eccentric
writer makes himself known on every page,
like the cinematic auteur Alfred Hitchcock
did during the same era only on screen.

If you want to read what feels like a
movie, and get an actual understanding of
what it means to present aistory in all of-
its gritty, terrifying reality, sit down (in a
dark room) with “In Cold Blood.” There’s an
ocean full of memoirs, but only a few real
gems of dramatic nonﬁction.

“The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test” by
Tom Wolfe '

One of the best choices I made in college
was reading Tom Wolfe’s “The Electric Kool-
Aid Acid Test,” one of the ﬁnest examples
of the New Journalism genre. Following
KenoKesey and the Merry Pranksters, Wolfe
dives head ﬁrst into the realms of 1960s hip-
pie culture to see what all the fuss is about.

Though psychedelic drug culture, the
perceived zeitgeist of that era, has been
widely mocked and berated “The Electric
Kool-Aid Acid Test” does not try to paint the
movement as an incomprehensible horror,
butgrather follows the people involved and
lets the readers draw their own conclusions.

Mind you, some of the writing is more
visceral than understandable, and the word-

T ing twists and turns just like the split second

you get a handle on the semantic stylings
of the book, you begin to ﬂy through it.
Tom Wolfe’s classic is not just a tale de-
scribing the history of hippie movement;
it is in fact an integral piece of American
history, without any of the delicious and

sordid details omitted. The ﬁrsthand ac— A

structions like the recreational use of LSD,

jam bands like the Grateful Dead and the -

social unrest of Northern California.

“Catcher in the Rye” byJ.D. Salinger

This may seem like a clichéd answer as
the bookI have recommended has garnered
so much fame since its publication in 1951.
However, I believe that “Catcher in the Rye”
is the ultimate coming-of-age novel and, as
such, it is a must-read for any adolescent.

Almost anyone who readsJ.D. lSalinger’s
classic is able to relate in some way to its
protagonist, Holden Caulﬁeld. As a boy
caught between adolescence and adulthood,
Caulﬁeld experiences the same alienation
and angst that many people experience. He
becomes disgruntled with almost everyone
he meets in the story and even occupies
himself with the fantasy of going out West.

What readers can take away from the

book is quite valuable —— that alienation and
angst are only phases that come with grow-
ing up and trying to ﬁnd yourself. Holden
condemns himself for the negative attitudes
he expressed toward people throughout the
novel at the very end, when he says that he
misses everybody.

The novel reminds us that, whatever
phase you are stumbling through, you are
never alone in your experience. Sometimes
it takes the love of a sister to “catch” you,
though.

“The Autobiography of Malcolm X” by
Malcolm X and Alex Haley

As I reminisced over the many literary
excursions I’ve taken throughout my col-
lege years, I realized that there was only
one book among dozens that forced me to
demand more of myself. That book was “The
Autobiography of Malcolm X.” _

Reading about Malcolm X’s struggles,
triumphs, cunning and the zealous way he
invested himself in everything he did --
from burglary to reading 15 hours a day
while in prison, to ﬁercely battling for his
rights — forced me to reexamine my own
goals and dreams and realize that guts, ef-
fort and passion can drive an individual to
do extraordinary things. It’s a book that in-
spires in readers to take on challenges that
would have seemed daunting beforehand.

The autobiography was the result of a
collaboration between X and journalist
Alex Haley, and the epiloguethat Haley
writes should not be skipped over. It reveals
a different side of X, the ﬂawed, tired, hu-

man side that struggled to overcome his
past as a member of the Nation of Islam
and his reputation as a violent man. This
ﬂawed side of X — and his ﬂaws were many,
ranging from outdated views on gender to
antisemitism — is important. It allows us
to see that even the most strong-willed and
impressive individuals suffer from many of
the same insecurities and weaknesses that
plague us all, yet they overcome.

“The Year of Magical Thinking” byjoan
Didion V

Life changes fast. Life changes in an in-
stant. You sit down to dinner and life as
you know it ends. The question of self—pity.

By now, it is perhaps safe to say that each
of us have experienced some tragedy in _our
lifetime, be it the death of a friend, parent
or the loss of a meaningful friendship. But
how do we make sense of it? Do we let the
hurt consume us, scar us for a lifetime‘? Do
we carry on inspite of it and strive towards
a better self ? The italicized words were the
ﬁrstlwords that Joan Didion wrote down
after the sudden death of her late husband.
In the most vulnerable moment of her life,
Didion decided to create, perhaps in at-

. tempt to make sense of something unable

to be understood.

It’s confounding to us when we lose
someone so meaningful, so quickly —— in
the “ordinary” instant. There is a certain
wisdom to her prose, allowing readers to
perhaps more fully understand their own
mourning after reading the meditations of
Didion’s process. She is not an omniscient

voice and she doesn’t try to be. Instead, it
is her honesty and questioning that speak
volumes to the forever-changed reader.

“A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering
Genius” by Dave Eggers

Dave Eggers’ mostly true memoir ex-
plores the most wretched places within a
twenty-something’s mind: the parts that
scream, “I’m right and the rest of the world
is wrong.”

It chronicles Dave’s stewardship of his
younger brother, Toph, after their parents
die. Having seen his older siblings live
incredibly monotonous lives, Dave care-
fully maps out Toph’s future in his head. He
—— and he alone —— has the right to deﬁne
Toph’s life. '

Strikingly visceral, much of the book
spews from~Dave’s neurotic inner—mono-
logues, immersing the reader in his mis-
anthropic attacks on those who he feels are
silently berating him for pioneering a new
and different world for Toph.

Dave’s inability to deal with criticism
leads him to view everyone around him as
subjects in his running commentary. They
aren’t friends or lovers, just characters in
his grand narrative.

“We are all feeding from each other, all
the time, every day,” says Dave, who feels
he has been robbed of his youth as he spars
with reality and responsibility in a way that
commands readers to reevaluate how much
control they have over how the world and
people around them affect their lives. I

College isn‘t just an opportunity for students
to mold their post—high school identity and
discover their passions, but also an oppor-
tunity to look good while doing it.

In the summer before a new college se-
mester starts, many young adults build their
wardrobe for the coming year, but ’there’s
more to it than just grabbing a pair of Sper-
ry’s boat shoes. It takes careful planning and
smart purchases to build the right wardrobe.

A good button—up is the fashionable
20—something man’s Swiss Army knife. It
can be used alongside countless types of
styles and should be chosen with care.

But despite what rapper Macklemore
might say, you can’t just roll up at thrift
shop and grab whatever looks like it has
the most “steez.” Patterned button-ups are
the perfect example, as they’re in the midst

‘of a strong resurgence, but require a good

eye for detail. While a careless selection will
have you looking like Ted Mosby, winding
up with a patterned button—up or twothat
ﬁts into your look is a much-needed, subtle
dash of spice.

Stores such as H&M are great for these
sorts of shirts, but these shirts are usually
made entirely of incredibly thin cotton.
Though such material will keep you cool
in the summer, the dryers in residence hall
laundromats don’t treat these shirts gently
and sometimes spit them out as wrinkled

balls of fabric far past the point of no return.

‘ If you’re going to invest in light and breezy,

be ready with your iron heating up.

The Oxford, which has heavier threading
than its thinner brethren, can circumvent
that problem. Oxford button-ups aren’t
necessarily a particular brand per se, but
almost any retail company that carries them
is sure to throw that buzzword on its tag to
let shoppers know what it’s holding.

After his 18th birthday, a guy should
become comfortable with tucking in his
button—up — and not just on formal occa-
sions. It’s the epitome of an age—old trend
that’s representative of being conﬁdent

,;

enough to show up in perma-business ca»

sual. It might have been a “nerdy” thing
to do in high school — then again, so was
studying — but it is forever in voguein the
real world. Chances are that whatever job
your major grants you won’t allow pinnies
that say “Class of 2012” in the workplace, so
there really is no harm in acclimating early.
Some button-ups, depending on their’ ﬁt
or make, just don’t look good when they’re
tucked in. If they’re a slim ﬁt or not very
long, then they’re best left outside of your
pants. Flannels, for example, have no place
being tucked in, but a nice, solid—colored
linen shirt is a different story. M
Whether or not you choose to tuck your
shirts into your pants, your trousers are a
big part of pulling any outﬁt together.
Most importantly, pants need a belt, and

The best venues for students in Pittsburgh

 Vincent Smith and John Lavanga
‘ The Pitt News Staﬁ’

V For all the great things going on in Oakland,
perhaps its greatest deﬁciency is the lack
, of a major concert venue. Since the closure
 of the storied Club Laga, which once stood

 where the IGA is, Oakland residents: have - A
,g been forced to look elsewhere to see the .

 best national and local acts. Many of these
T venues are only accessible to people over the
age-of 21, creating an additional roadblock
for younger students on the hunt for a show.
For students in this particular predicament,
 here are some of the best venues to catch
 great shows.

 

Stage AE

400 N Shore Dr., North Shore, 15212
www.promowestlive.com
412-229-5483

Type of music: large national acts

 

AE has become Pittsburgh’s go-to venue
for huge national acts and bandsthat are
guaranteed to draw large crowds. Located
on the North Shore near Heinz Field and
PNC Park, the venue has three different sec-
tions, including an outdoor amphitheater
, designed for over 5,000 people, an indoor
 venue with seating for over 2,000, and a

dred. Most of the bigger shows sell out fast
and the ticket prices‘ generally hang in the
$40andup range, so its important to keep
and eye out for yourfavorite major acts way
ahead of time.

Altar Bar

1620 Penn Ave., Strip District, 15222
www.thealtarbar.com

412-263-2877

Type of music: metal, hip-hop, hardcore

and the occasional indie act

Altar Bar has gained a decent following
in recent years for managing to draw in a
myriad of acts from many genres, most of
which lay just onthe cusp of mainstream.
The venue is a formerfchurch and provides
a surprisingly fun space to get down in.
Though the venue used to be a primarily
21+ spot, they’ve recently moved towards
al1——ages shows. The majority of acts are
either hard rock or hip-hop acts, but they
will book something surprising every once
in awhile. . . 9 -

Garﬁeld Artworks .

4931 Penn Ave., Garﬁeld, 15224
www.garﬁeldartworks.com ,  . 1
412-361-2262 » ~ V.
Type of music: fringe acts and local indie

bands

Garﬁeld Artworks has gained some mea-
sure of notoriety in Pittsburgh as “that hall-
way in Garﬁeld where psychedelic bands
play.” What Garﬁeld Artworks lacks in aes-
thetics, however, it more than makes up
for with affordable shows and 1aid—back,
friendly atmosphere. Most of the acts com-
ing through are still small time, so interact-
ing with the bands isn’t uncommon. Don’t
count out every bandtthat rolls through,
though. It wasn’t too long ago that estab-
lished two-piece rock band Japandroids
made a stop here.

Mr. Small’s Theatre

400 Lincoln Ave, Millvale, 15209
(412) 821-4447
www.mrsmalls.com

Let’s face it: Pittsburgh is not the best
place for popular musical acts. The city has
a dearth of venues to facilitate such crowds
and it seems like every time a solid venue
gets going, the place is forced to close its
doors for one reason or another. So, if you
plan to see any up-and-coming acts or in
vogue indie hands, you are more than likely
going to end up at Mr. Small’s Theatre in
Millvale.

For years the Mr. Roboto Project had its
home in Wilkinsburg on Wood Street. The
venue tended to attract touring bands living

the venue became a staple of the Pittsburgh

INTERVIEW

A talk with Pittsburgh Fi|mmaker’s Gary Kaboly

John Lavanga
Impulse Editor

If you’re a lover of cinema and you live in Pitts-
burgh, it’s nearly inevitable that you’re going
to be a frequenter of Pittsburgh Filmmakers.
The organization helps bring some of the most
intriguing limited—release ﬁlms in the world to
the city and plays them in intriguing theaters
all over the city.

Gary Kaboly, the director of exhibitions at
Pittsburgh Filmmakers, spoke to The Pitt News
about the organizations aims, the ﬁlm programs
it run and the essential magic of the movie the-
ater experience.

What’s the ultimate aim of Pittsburgh
Filmmkers?

GK: [We teach] the idea of cinema as an art
form and not simply as entertainment. Not
that our ﬁlms can’t be entertaining obviously,
but [we convey] the richness of cinema and the
history of cinema. .

TPN: What sort of decision-making process
determines what ﬁlms are selected by Pitts-
burgh Filmmakers?

GK: Obviously we can’t bring in everything
because we’re limited in the number of venues
that we have, but something that’s usually cur-
rent. Iwouldn’t call us curators as much as we’re
portals. Ourtheaters are portals to see theﬁlms
that are new to the country, new to the city. The

ﬁhns that are playing in New York or L.A. that
people say, “Why can’t I see that in Pittsburgh?”
Chances are we will end up playing it.

TPN: What about the classic ﬁlms?

GK: We do a couple of different classic series.
We do ours on Sunday nights at the [Regent
Square Theater], and we initiated recently a
classic monthly series at our Melwood Screen-

ing Room.

We may have a headingfor a certain type of
ﬁlm: ﬁlm noir, or a woman ﬁlm, or a romance
or a coup1e’s ﬁlm. But within that series we try
to generate enough variety, so it’s not the same
audience coming week after week after week.
So our series titles are just really general titles
and within that format you might see ﬁlms that,
at ﬁrst glance, aren’t really very similar to one
another. But at the core they make a statement
or some type of observation that are related to
the other ﬁlms. ‘ .

TPN: Why do you think students should
come visit Pittsburgh Filmmakers?

It’s an experience they’re not going to ﬁnd
at the commercial theaters. The experience of
seeing aﬁlm that they normally wouldn’t see on
abig screen with other people is very...ﬁ.1lﬁlling.
It’s kind of like when you’re sitting around a
campﬁre listening to stories, it’s that kind of ex-
perience. I think it’s so much more enjoyable to
see aﬁlm on alarge screen than downloaded and
streamed onto acomputer in your living room.
That’s a convenient way, and I think everyone

does that, but to see a ﬁlm with a large group
of people is very enriching. We’re providing an
option to see ﬁlms the way they were intended
to be seen when made. And Pitt students, they
get into our movies for four bucks. I -

RECORDS

shopping and the experience it provides.
In an era where acquiring the newest A$AP
Rocky track involves just couple of button-
clicks and a two—minute wait while the album
downloads, the experience of record hunting
is a fantastic change of pace.

“It’s very convenient to have 10,000 songs
in your pocket, but they seem a lot more
disposable when it’s like that,” Spehar said.

The beauty of records, Spehar notes, is in
the action. “When you buy a record, the whole
process of going to a store, looking, ﬂipping
through stuff, taking it home, opening it up,
physically tak_ing an action to play it,” rather
than pushing a button and getting instant
gratiﬁcation, is a part of the magic of it.

All the original album artwork, now
considered a fairly unimportant aspect of
albums, doesn’t hurt either.

“I like the bright colors,” Spehar said. I

FOOTBALL

/ SPORTS

Questions abound for the Pitt football program

Nate Barnes
Assistant Sports Editor

The 2012 season marked yet another year of
transition for the Pittsburgh Panthers’ once-
proud football program. After head coach Dave
Wannstedtwas forced to resign by administra-
tion, Mike Haywoodwas ﬁred because ofanar-
rest on a domestic violence charge and Todd
Graham ducked out the back door to Arizona
State, Pitt was left with little to work with enter-
ing the season.

Former Wisconsin offensive coordinator
Paul Chryst took the reins in 2012 and, to put
it nicely, made the best out of a bad situation.
Expectations did not run high for the Panthers,
evidenced by College Football News projecting
Pitt to ﬁnishat 7-5 and ﬁfth in the conference.

Pitt almost did nearly that in the regular
season, ﬁnishing 6-6 and at  in the confer-
ence with a 3-4 Big East record. Pitt just went

about its business inthe most Pittway possible,
‘meaning the football team’s season made just

about no sense.
Pitt started its season 0-2, losing badly to

1 Football Championship Subdivision opponent

Youngstown State in the opening game of the

V seasonandthenbeingdefeatedevenworseﬁve

days later in a Thursday night, early-season
Big East special on national television against
Cincinnati.

Aweek and ahalflater, then-No. 13 Virginia
Tech rolled into town, and Pitt rolled over the
Hokies. The rest of the way it was lose two, win
two by Pitt before the Panthers lost to Ole Miss
38-17 inthe BBVA Compass Bowl and ultimately
ﬁnished at 6-7.

Andas with the previous two seasons, there
are a lot more questions than perceived an-
swers surrounding the 2013 rendition of the
Pitt football team.

Who ever thought Pitt fans would sit around
and ponder who would replace Tino Sunseri?
Probably few, but that’s the current situation
as Chryst will likely rely on either transfer Tom
Savage or Graham—recruited Chad Voytik to take
the reins in the backﬁeld.

As of now, each option looks to literally leave
Pitt in good hands, and a quarterback compe-
tition in summer training camp should only
serve to beneﬁt whoever wins the starting j ob.
Savage looks to be the favorite and was the No.
10—ranked quarterback prospect out of Cardinal
O’Hara High School in its 2009 class, which
included Matt Barkley and national champion-
ship winner A._]. McCarron.

Behind him, Voytik was recruited by Gra-
ham but stayed at Pitt and redshirted during
Chryst’s ﬁrst season. Savagewas the favorite
for the starting job, but after Voytik complete
27-of—33 passes for 358 yards and three touch-
downs at the armual spring intrasquad game,
the redshirt freshman thrust his name into the
conversation as to who will lead the huddle in
Pitt’s Labor Day season opener against Florida
State at Heinz Field.

Alongside the quarterback competition, Pitt
needs to address who will contribute at the skill
positions after the graduation of tailback Ray
Graham and wide receiver Mike Shanahan as

’ well as tailback Rushel Shell’s transfer to UCLA.

On the outside, it appears that redshirt se-
nior wideout Devin Street is prepared to assume
the mantle of the teams No. 1 receiver after his
best season to date saw him rack up 73 recep-
tions for 975 yards and ﬁve touchdowns. Expect
to see the names of Ronaldjones and Ed Tinker
shuffled in and out of packages.

But the biggest contributor to the receiv-
ing corps aside from Street might not even be
in Pittsburgh yet. This, of course, is four-star
recruit Tyler Boyd, a huge pickup for Chryst
after losing out on another four-star receiver

What to expect as a
new Pitt fan

Dan Sostek
Staﬁ Wrz'ter

I arrived at Pitt as a freshman last fall, excited
to enter a new environment, excited to begin
my studies and excited to meet new friends.
I couldn’t wait to move into my dorm in Li-
tchﬁeld Towers and eat as much as I could at
Market Central.

But on my calendar, it wasn’t the ﬁrst day
of classes I circled. It was Sept. 1: the ﬁrst foot-
ball game of the season for the Pitt Panthers as
they took on the Youngstown State Penguins
in what most would consider a “tune-up”
game for the remaining difficult matchups
on the team’s schedule.

I had been to college sporting events be-

fore, mostly Penn State games that I attended»

with my grandparents. But it’s a completely
different atmosphere attending games as a
member of the student body. There’s a bond, a
sense of unity, a collective link to the students
on the ﬁeld. It was a glorious moment when I
entered the gates of Heinz Field, immediately
thrust into a sea of gold and blue.

But this game was not a glorious one. It was
a rainy day, and lightning delayed the game.
And that wasn’t the worst part.

When the game actually started, the heav-
ily favored Panthers played stagnant offense
and ineffective defense. Pitt lost to its oppo-
nent from the NCAA’s Football Championship
Subdivision, 31-17.

I will never forget that completely deﬂated
feeling. .

This was the worst possible way to begin
my career as a fan of Pitt athletics. But it did
teach me something valuable, a philosophy
that every new Pitt fan should adopt upon
arriving in Oakland: Expect the unexpected.

I understand the eye rolls that the cliche
elicits. It’s been said over and over again about
sports, television shows, movies and politics.
But in Pitt’s recent athletic history, it’s become
a recurring motif. Using just last year as a case
study, it’s easy to map the variance during a
year of Pitt athletics.

Unpredictability can occur on the football
ﬁeld, as the Youngstown State loss indicated.
Then, after starting the season 0-2, the Pitt
football team steamrolled the No. 13-ranked
Virginia Tech Hokies, 35-17.

Later in November against the undefeat-
ed No. 3 Notre Dame Fighting Irish, the un-
ranked Panthers shocked everyone watching
the NBC broadcast by jumping out to a 20-6
lead after three quarters. if

Pitt then squandered that lead and lost the
game, 29-26, in overtime. The most painful
moment came when Kevin Harper shanked
a 33-yard ﬁeld goal, which wou1d’ve scored a
26-23 victory for Pitt over Notre Dame.

Instead, Notre Dame took the ball back
and scored on a game-winning touchdown

after a quarterback dive by Everett Golson.

The Pitt basketball team had its share of
surprises on the court as well. In a fashion
similar to the Notre Dame football team, the
heavily favored Panthers came roaring back
from a large deﬁcit in the ﬁnal minutes to
force overtime and defeat the Oakland Griz-
zlies in November, 72-62.

Pitt also defeated rival No. 19 Georgetown
73-45 on the road, handing the Hoyas their
worst loss in nearly 40 years, and upset No.6
Syracuse at the Petersen Events Center, 65-55.

On the other hand, the Panthers also ex-
perienced some sore surprises, most notably
their loss in the NCAA tournament as N o.
8 seed to the Final Four—bound No.9—seed
Wichita State Shockers.

Nevertheless, these unexpected results
are seemingly always second to what occurs
off the playing ﬁeld.

For example, in the span of a week last
April,’ heralded running back Rushel Shell
and shooting guard Trey Zeigler announced
their plans to transfer, while the basketball
team’s greatest asset, center Steven Adams,
announced that he will enter the NBA draft
despite previously denying these accusations.

Later in the month, three football players‘;
were suspended from the team after being
present at a drug bust, while fan-favorite ].].
Moore announced his plans to transfer from
the men’s basketball team. Moore’s impend-
ing transfer will mark the ﬁfth departure from
the team this year after sophomores Malcolm.
Gilbert and John Johnson also transferred
during the season. -

But this is not a plea for pity or a declara-
tion of ineptitude. To use another cliche, it
is what it is. Pitt is not by any stretch of the
imagination the only team that experiences
surprises. 3

But forfans of the school and the program,
every unexpected occurrence is intensiﬁed
dramatically. It’s a burden every fan must
bear.

When looking at Pitt athletics from a
broader scope, there are certain things to
expect.

The Oakland Zoo will always be one of the
loudest and craziest student fan sections in’
the nation. Pitt’s mascot, Roc the Panther, will
always prowl around the stadium, interacting
with students and fans. 

Yes, maybe every so often a player will:
transfer or a coach will take a new job and?
leave a team in what looks to be utter sham-§
bles. When these things happen, the entire;
Pitt “twitterverse” will explode with tweets fu-3
eled with sarcasm, anger, wit and intelligencei

Everywhere on campus, people will dis-.§
cuss the latest news about Pitt athletics. This
is all rooted in the Pitt athletic program’s most}
certain guarantee of all: people care.

And you will too. ﬂ

Men’s Basketball: Pitt rebounds, now must rebuild

Nate Barnes
Assz'sta7zt Sports Editor

Pitt men’s basketball bounced backinits 2012-13
season after missing the NCAA Tournament in

2011-12. The 2011-12 seasons marked the ﬁrst

time the Panthers missed the tournament in a
decade and the only time during head coach
Jamie Dixon’s tenure at Pitt.

-; In the most recent season, Pitt ﬁnished 24-9
overall and with a 12-6 record in Big East play
— good enough to earn a double-bye in the Big
East tournament and a No. 8 seed in the 2013
NCAA Tournament.

But, like in so many seasons past, Pittﬂoun—
dered once again when it came to postseason
basketball.

V At Madison Square Garden, Syracuse elimi-
nated Pitt from Big East tournament play with
a 62-59 victory. One week later, No. 9 seeded
Wichita State dealt Pitt its worst loss of the sea-
son in a73-55 upset victory over the Panthers at
Energy Solutions Arena in Salt Lake City, Utah.

Just when Pitt fans thought things couldn’t
get worse, Trey Zeigler armounced his transfer
and Steven Adams declared he would enter
the NBA Draft. As a result, Pitt lost two players
expectedto help soften the loss of senior leaders
Tray Woodall and Dante Taylor.

; In addition, forwardJ.J. Moore is rumored

amar Patterson will playa key role as a returning starter for Pitt in the fall.

, to transfer to with the help of Dixon.

But, it really is not all bad. If anything, Pitt
has an opportunity to recreate its image. After

all, Dixon has said he enjoys having scholarships
available in the spring and summer to atuact
new players.

 

So far, Dixon has taken advantage of this
late signing period. In at least attempting to
replace the departed Adams and Zeigler, junior
college transferjoseph Uchebo will join return-
ing starter and senior Talib Zanna in the post.

Uchebo, a 6’9”, 240 lb. center, was a former_,

North Carolina State commit before playing
junior college ball in Florida. He received a four-
star rankingfrom major recruiting services out
of high school.

Alongside Uchebo, Dixon was set to add
a Pittsburgh native in DeAndre Kane, who
played his high school hoops a stone’s throw
from the Petersen Events Center at Schenley
High School prior to his prep playing days. Kane
played alongside former Pitt forward and cur-
rent San Antonio Spur, Dejuan Blair, and St.
John’s alum D.J. Kennedy.

Kane was dismissed from the Marshall bas--. -

ketball program by former Pitt assistant and
now Thundering Herd head coach, Tom Her-
rion, which creates the potential for his return
to Pittsburgh. Kane averaged 15 points per game
alongside 7.1 assists this past season and would
be a solid scoring complement to returning
starter and sophomore James Robinson, who
is more of a facilitator out of the backcourt.
At this point, Kane is reportedly still ex-
ploring hisoptions as evidenced by a visit to

Southern California and an upcoming visit to
Memphis despite telling CBSSports.com his
transfer to Pitt was a “done deal.” It’s a situa-
tion to monitor and one that would beneﬁt the
Panthers’ backcourt depth greatly after Pitt lost
out on guard prospectjon Severe and Rutgers
transfer Eli Carter.

Along with the transfer prospects, Dixon’s
brought in some solid recruits the traditional
way. Power forward Mike Young — an ESPN
100 prospect — and three—star point guard
josh Newkirk should both play right away at Pitt.

Young is aversatile power forward who can ,

score from the perimeter and in the post. He

should play at least 20 minutes per game as a
major component of Dixon’s frontcourt trio.
Newkirk should also see time in the backcourt,
especially in the event that Kane transfers else-
where. Newkirk can jump ‘ou_t_of the building
as displayed on his high school highlight reels,
which show him throwing down vicious dunks.

These players will join returning starters
Robinson, Zanna andsenior Lamar Patterson.
Patterson and Zanna each averaged roughly
10 points per game last season, with Zanna
leading the team in" scoring for the majority
of the season.

play. Patterson turned up big for Pitt in some
games, such as his 22-point performance at
home against Marquette which included an
overtime-forcing triple as time expired, but
also seems to disappear at times.

Robinson proved more than capable of run-
ningthe pointas atrue freshman and the reins
will be inhis hands this season. Robinson’s num-
bers weren’t magniﬁcent, but he showed the
ability to do just about whatever the Panthers
needed him to in clutch situations.

WhilePitt’s retuming big names and incom-
ing talent will likely steer the course of Pitt’s
2013-14 season, look out for the potential con-
tributions of other players. On the perimeter, it
starts with junior Cam Wright and sophomore
Durandjohnson.

Additionally,_]ohnson proved to be lightning

hustle off the bench.Johnson deservedly devel-

oped a reputation as a chucker from three, but\\

displayed a commitment to defense and doing
the “little things” over the course ofhis redshirt
freshman season.
At the very end of the bench, there is redshirt
freshman Chrisjones, sophomore Mike Lecak

won’t see much time other than mop—up duty
unless injuries knock afew of the rotation guys
out of the lineup. ' -
Overall, the next season in Pitt basketbal
could prove more important than last year’s,
in which the Panthers sought to rebound from

In the backﬁeld expect Pitt to struggle

Bennett performed the best of the three in
the April scrimmage, carrying 20 times for 114
yards. Crockett ﬁnished with 11.carries for 45
yards, and Brown ran 18 times for 90 yards. .
The defensive side of the ball should prove
to be the strongest side for Pitt this season. The
defense returns nearly every starter, save for
safetyjarred Holley because of graduation.

On the defensive line, Aaron Donald returns
after another solid season. Donaldﬁnished 2012
as aﬁrst-team All-Big East member after he put.

Last season, Pitfs defense ranked No.17 in
the nation in yards allowed per game at just
330.5. On the edge, Pitt returns both of its start-
ing corners in K’Waun Williams and Lafayette
Pitts, who helped lead Pitt’s No. 20 pass defense,
which allowed 194.2 yards per game.

‘ Overall, the defense returns 15 players who
started at least one game from last year’s team.

As Pitt found out in its overtime loss to Notre
Dame, there are also the special teams. With
kicker Kevin Harper having graduated, Drake

Greer and Brad Lukasak remain the two kickers '

on the roster. A
But expect incoming freshman Chris Blewitt
to contend for the starting job right away as the
ﬁfth-ranked player at his position. Yes, his name
might indicate bad news, but don’t be surprised
if, in true Pitt fashion, a kicker named “Blewitt”

: ZOO

 Oakland Zoo creates raucous atmosphere as ‘Sixth Man’

Megan Boyle
Stcﬁ’ Writer

As the lights dim and a spotlight focuses on
the Pitt team’s bench, something within the
Petersen Events Center is unleashed. Sud-

r denly the lower—level section of fans begin to
, jump up and down repeatedly and yell at the
_ top of their lungs like a bunch of animals.

, 1!}_ What appears to be madness is com-
; pletely ordinary for those in attendance

at a Pitt basketball game — those fans are

- part of the Oakland Zoo.

Roots of the Zoo V
e Formed in 2001 by a group of students,

5 -the Oakland Zoo is now one of the largest

and rowdiest student sections in the nation.
Consisting of more than 1,400 dedicated

"fans, the Zoo is quite a sight to see on game
: day.

The Pete is often referred to as one of

V the toughest arenas to play in because of

the Zoo’s intimidating presence. Playing
in front of the Zoo at the Petersen Events
Center — opened on April 27, 2003 — Pitt
owns a 180-22 record, one of college bas-
ketball’s best home records since that time.

As a result of the Zoo’s impact, Pitt was
ranked the sixth—loudest place to play by a
2010 “ESPN The Magazine” article and the
seventh-toughest place to play in a 2010
Bleacher Report article.

. In addition, the Zoo has been featured in
the Wall Streetjournal and in 2012, national
college basketballwriters Eamonn Brennan
and Dana O’Neil of ESPN selected the Zoo
as the nation’s No. 2 student section behind
Duke’s Cameron Crazies.

“It’s always fun,” O’Neil said about
the Petersen Events Center in a podcast.
“There’s always huge energy in there  [The
Zoo] takes it very seriously, and I do think
they make a difference having talked to

players and stuff there.”

Gameday

A sea of gold encircles the court, and
it is not uncommon to see many students
dress up to show their Pitt pride. Whether it
be Green Man suits, animal masks or body
paint, fans know no bounds as they come
to cheer on their favorite basketball team.

“Everyone’s involved, it’s a lot of fun,
and you get to forget about school for a
little while,” Oakland Zoo presidentjordan

Shoup said.

The Zoo is admired so much that the
organization was dubbed the “Sixth Man”
as indicated by the headbands distributed
to students who waited as many as 27 hours
before the Syracuse game.

The nickname is derived from the stan‘;
dard ﬁve players who are allowed on the
court during a game. The “Sixth Man” is
not a starter, but a versatile player off the
bench whose talent is not underappreciated.
Thus, the name was embraced by the Zoo
because of its loyal support to the team and
its ability to pump up the Panthers.

As with any cheering section there
are, of course, certain rituals performed
throughout the game, including reading
“The Zoo News” while the opposing team
is introduced and participating in the use of
“spirit ﬁngers” when a member of the Pitt.
basketball team is at the foul line. Without
fail, the Zoo always has some sort of chant
planned and background info about the
opposing team’s star player.

“There’s a ridiculous amount of excite-
ment and crazy energy. All the students are

just as excited as you are to be there,” senior
Zoo enthusiastjack Sabin said.

The leaders of the Zoo take care of their
young by making sure everyone is in unison

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL

Women’s basketball

.— —~ Tyler Pecyna

Staﬁ Writer

Although Pitt women’s basketball leaves
behind a conference in which it had not
won a game in more than two years, it now
,_enters the ACC with the biggest transition of
the off—season occurring at the head coach-
ing position.

For the ﬁrst time in more than a decade,
someone other than former head coach Ag-
nus Berenato will patrol the Pitt sideline
and oversee the basketball operations on
a daily basis. The woman pegged with that
task is acclaimed Pittsburgh—native Suzie
McConnell—Serio, who was named the new
leader of the Panthers on April 12, 2013.

McConnell—Serio previously coached at
nearby Duquesne University beginning in

_ ,the 2007-08 season until last year, when the

Dukes earned a 24-8 record and their ﬁfth
consecutive postseason berth by reaching
the National Invitation Tournament. In that
time, McConnell—Serio said she garnered an
understanding of Pitt’s leaders on the court
as members of an opposing team.

“Two of the players from the previous
season, going into [Duquesne’s game against
Pitt], that we would be keying on were Bri-
anna Kiesel and Asia Logan,” she said of the
contest that the Panthers lost, 70-61.

Kiesel, a junior guard, broke out last sea-

3.0 assists per game. In tandem with senior erage ranked 14th in the Big East and whose

7.2 rebounds per game were tops among
the Panthers, Kiesel established a viable
offensive attack that is expected to progress
under a new, up—tempo coaching scheme.

“I like her new offenses,” Logan said.
“There is more motion involved, and that’s
what [coach McConnell—Serio] brings.”

Logan said that although she’s a post-
player, the new style of play being empha-
sized will allow her to ﬁnish more fast—break
opportunities and help the team put up more
points overall.

But a fast-paced offense, which Kiesel
referred to as “run and gun,” is not the only
aspect of McConnell—Serio’s coaching that
has impacted the team and aided in the in-
culcation of a fresh atmosphere.

Early on, Kiesel has taken heed of her.
new coach’s tutelage.

“In our ﬁrst day of practice, it was just a
different vibe,” she said. “There was a lot of
excitement and she was teaching us what we
need to do instead of just [looking on]} She’s
actually explaining to us how to do things
the correct way.”

The Panthers are all ears for someone
who hopes to return the program to its ﬁrst
winning season since its 2009-2010 cam-
paign: a challenge that seemed too over-
whelming in the past couple years of Big

Panther Pitt renews student section, creates excitement

Caitlin Hinsey
Stafj’ Writer

“And that’s a ﬁrst down Panthers!”

The booming voice from the Pitt Pan-
thers’ announcers rings over the fans in
Heinz Field, informing them of what has
just taken place before their eyes. As the
fans begin to quiet down, they hear the Pitt
drumline begin to play and soonvoices from
the end zone begin to echo throughout the
65,050 seats. _ ,

“Go Pitt...Go Pitt...First Down!” the stu-
dent section shouts in unison. A

While most fans enjoy the ﬁrst down for

abrief moment, the Panther Pitt revels in it. ’

The leaders of the recreated student section
help create an atmosphere of pride and ex-
citement for all fans at Heinz Field through-
out all four quarters of Pitt football games.
Taking its name from a previous attempt
at a student section, the Panther Pitt was
‘recreated in 2012 and is led by junior Brian
Terreri. The Panther Pitt hopes to create
the exciting atmosphere that once was a
common theme at Pitt football games of the
past, but has since declined. _

head coachjoejordano, who attained a mile-
stone of his own when the Panthers defeated
Villanova on May 12 to earn their 40th win
of the season. The win also gave Jordano
750 in his career.

At the end of the season, Jordano was
also named as the Big East Coach of the Year
for his work at Pitt’s helm. Behind Jordano,
Pitt cracked the rankings in all ﬁve major
national baseball polls, which included a No.
16 national ranking from Collegiate Baseball.

In addition tojordano, multiple Panthers
earned recognition as some of the confer-
ence’s elite players. Pitcher Ethan Mildren,
right ﬁelder Casey Roche, and catcher Elvin

» Soto all were selected to the All-Big East

First Team.

Alongside those three players, pitchers
Matt Wotherspoon and Rhys Aldenhoven,
outﬁelders Steven Shelinsky Jr. and Ste-
phen Vranka, and designated hitter Boo
Vazquez were tabbed for the All-Big East
Second Team.

On the mound, Ethan Mildren anchored
the staff with a 9-3 record and a 2.45 earned
run average. Mildren ﬁnished tied for the
conference-lead with 14 starts, and ﬁnished
ninth in ERA. Mildren ﬁnished with a con-

ference-best 106 and two-thirds innings
pitched. .

Roche ﬁnished ﬁrst in the Big East in
runs batted in with 63, and tied for second
in home runs at nine. Roche’s .345 batting
average was good enough to place him ninth
among all Big East hitters.

Soto hit .325 to lead all Big East -catchers
while hitting six home runs and driving in
41 runs. Soto ﬁnished with an on-base plus
slugging percentage of .950 and recorded
18 extra-base hits. 

Among second team selections, Al-
denhoven ﬁnished with the conference’s
eighth—best ERA at 2.42, which helped him
stay undefeated at 8-0 until his ﬁnal start
at conference-champion Louisville where
he picked up his only loss of the season.
Wotherspoon’s record ended at 9-2 with a
3.82 ERA, throwing 99_innings in 14 starts
and striking out 77 batters to lead all Pan-
ther pitchers.

In the outﬁeld, Shelinsky set a school-
record by recording 47 walks to tie for the
conference lead. The necessity to pitch
around Shelinsky derived from his Big East
leading 12 home runs this season. Shelinsky
ﬁnished with a .314 average and 52 RBI to
accompany his 12 long-balls.

Out of the lead-off spot, Stephen Vran-
ka hit .316 with seven home runs and 46
RBI. Vranka stole 16 bases in 19 attempts,
recorded 22 extra-base hits, and a OPS of
.959. Vranka also led the conference in runs
scored at 63. ’

Designated hitter Boo Vazquez led the
Panthers at .346 with two home runs and 29
RBI. Vazquez’s average placed him seventh
among all Big East hitters. I

But. how does a student grab a hold ofa
ket to experience such a boisterous en-

Tickets are obtained through a lottery

are points you receive based on your atten-
dance record at men’s and women’s basketball
 The more loyalty points you rack up,

, Jordan Shoup, president of the Oakland
goo, recommends attending the early scrim-
Qgiriages and non—conference games in order to
receive tickets for key matchups later on in
the season against traditionally tough teams
such as Duke and Syracuse.

“You also get points for going to women’s
games,” Shoup said. “So Iencourage checking
our women’s team out with their new coach
and young team entering the ACC as well.”

Students can track the number of loyalty
points they have on their Athletics Login ac-
count through the ‘My Pitt’ Portal. This is
where students can request, claim and pur-
chases tickets.

When tickets are in high demand, they go

fthrough various distribution periods in the
lottery system. A

-gins about a week before the desired game.
‘ This is when students request their ticket on-
line and wait to see if they have been awarded

points does not guarantee a ticket, but rather,
Signiﬁcantly increases the chances of earn-

ticket. Regular-season tickets are only $5 per
game for students, with the exception of the
City Game vs. Duquesne at the Consol Energy
Center, whose tickets cost $10. Tickets for ex-
hibition games in the Petersen Events Center
are only $2 per game. Post—season tickets are
also awarded through the lottery process,

purposes. All tickets are general admission,
so seats are available on a ﬁrst—come, ﬁrst-

“Doors open about an hour and a half be-

no set time when students can start lining up.

upset the Orange. She recalls all 27 hours in

With this strong conference schedule, how

“Since a lot of people are probably going

than [27 hours before] ,?’ Turi said. “We have

Young Panthers take
2013 season as a learning
experience, look to 2012

Stqff - W riter

For Pitt teams, graduation is always a bit-
tersweet moment. Each team is proud that
its athletes are moving on to the next level,
whether in life or in sport. ‘
But it means they must leave the team

in order to do so. This annual dilemma ’

plagues teams every year.
The Pitt women’s softball team, how-
ever, did not face that dilemma this year.
The Panthers lost only one senior,
catcher Holly Stevens, to graduation, but

her presence on the ﬁeld will be greatly’

missed after she graduated with 34 home
runs, more than any other Pitt player in
the program’s history. Stevens ﬁnished her
career as a Panther with a 2013 campaign
that saw her hit .257 with seven home runs
and drive in a team—high 30 runs.

For her, the biggest adjustment to life
after Pitt is the loss of camaraderie she
experienced as a member of the team.

“Just being a part of a team in general.
It’s sad not being able to come back and
play with a bunch of girls that I love so
much,” Stevens said about what she’ll miss
most.

The Pitt softball team ended its season
with a win against Rutgers to make its ﬁnal
record 19-29 and 8—14 in Big East play. The
Panthers were a young team last season
and now that they are more experienced,
they hope to improve upon their skills -in
the upcoming season. y

“We had a tough season, so we learned
a lot about ourselves and how we play to+
gether as a team. We learned to be resil:-.
ient,” rising sophomore Tori Nirschl said‘.

The players on the team all want the
same thing: to improve upon last sea-

son’s performance and record. With such V

a young team, there was a lot to be learned,
and the players and coaches want to take
these lessons and apply them into the next
season. A
On the mound, Pitt has the junior duo
of starting pitchers AlexaLarkin (9-12)
and Savannah King (9-16). The pair hasé.
ﬁerce presence with Larkin’s earned run
average of 4.22 and King’s of 3.64. g
Larkin also led the team with 126 strike‘-
outs in 122 and two —thirds innings pitched

Men’s Club Volleyball

This past season proved an important
one for the Pitt Men’s Volleyball Club and
president Tim Cummings in what some
might call a transition year.

V “This past year was a pivotal stretch of
time for the club. We graduated all but one
 our starting players from the previous
year, but we were fortunate enough to have
a solid group of young returnees and a huge
class of freshmen, which left us with a deep
talent pool to pull our players ‘

from,” Cummings said. “During our regu-
lar season this past spring, our ‘A—team’ of
12 players

was made up of 9 underclassmen.” V

But the team still enjoyed some success
in the Central Division of the Eastern In-
tercollegiate Volleyball Association, and
some players were also recognized for their
individual efforts. ‘

“The highlight of the season was going
7-0 in our division play date against Rutgers,
Lehigh, Penn, Delaware, Navy, Maryland,
and Penn State,” Cummings said. “We ﬁn-
ished 7-1 with our only loss coming against
WVU at home on a previous date. Other
gighlights include having two All American
players [outside hitter Andrew Smith and

Joe Bender,junior,throws frisbee during practice at Cost Field. (Pitt News file photo)

Women’s Club Rugby

After a great deal of success in recent sea-

transition of the Pitt Women’s Club Rugby
team into the Mason Dixon Blue conference.
The move was made to put the Panthers in

three consecutive Allegheny Rugby Union
championships in 2009, ‘1o, and ‘11, and

WRESTLING

Wresﬂing moves on to a new

challenge in the

Nishant Singh | Staff Photographer

Dustin Gabler
Senior Stqff Wrz'ter

When the Pitt wrestling team returns tothe
mats this winter, it has zero chance of winning
its ﬁfth consecutive Eastern Wrestling League
championship.

But that’s because for the ﬁrst time since
1975, the Panthers willwrestle as members of a
new conference —the Atlantic Coast Conference.

“Our goal is to winthe ACC next year,” senior
Anthony Zanetta said. “Anything less in my eyes
will be a fail. We are a team that demands a lot
and sets our goals high. That’s a mentality that
we try to create here for Pitt wrestling.” A

It’s that mentality that has allowed the Pan-
thers to take three of me last four EWL dual-meet
championships and three of the last four EWL
postseason tournament championships. The
goals won’t change at all with the new confer-
ence foes.

“We want to winthe conference,” junior P.J.
Tasser said. “We want to take all ten guys to
nationals. We want to be ranked in the top—ﬁve
teams and we want to win a national title.”

With those lofty goals, you would never know
that this is a team adjusting to a new coach, but
adjusting may not be the right word todescribe
the switch from Rande Stottlemyer, Pitt’s head
wrestling coach for the last 34 years, to Jason
Peters, aformer assistant of Stottlemyer’s.

“I think the best thing about Coach Peters
taking over is that we really haven’t changed a
thing,” Tasser said.

Why would they? The Panthers have been
the class of the EWL over the last four years and
have made more noise at the NCAA tournament
than any Pitt squad since the late 1980’s. A

Despite the relatively seamless transition

between coaches, the 2013 team faces the chal-
lenge of replacinganumber of talented seniors,
including two All—Americans and three four-
year starters.

“Itwill be difﬁcult losing two All-Americans
and a national qualiﬁer,” senior Shelton Mack
said. “I feel like we have guys who are ready to
step in.” T

One of the wrestlers who could step in and
take abig—time role for Pitt is Tasser. The junior
has wrestled in some big matches for Pitt during
his career, such as his 9-2 victory over Edinboro’s

Warren Bosch last year, which helped propel ~

Pitt to an EWL dual-meet championship, and
even qualiﬁed at heavyweight for the NCAA
tournament two years ago.

“I’m lookingforward to the competition for

. star1:ingspots,”Tasser said. “Team competition

helps build our team as we make the transition
into a great wrestling conference.”

The freshmen and sophomores who started
in 2012 now have experience, and a talented
incoming class will be motivated to continue
Pitt’s upward trajectory — one that now factors
in a coaching and conference change.

“We have high expectations for the recruiting
class coming in and for the ﬁve other returning
national qualiﬁers,” Tasser said.

Despite all of that talent in the program,
Zanetta —- who redshirted last year and is
technically back for a second senior year —-
knows just how hard it is to ﬁll the void left by
the seniors.

“You carmot replace the seniors,” Zanetta
said. “They hadahuge impact for ourteam this
past year on and off the mat.”

Following the shift to the playoff—style
system, two national semiﬁnals will be held
at rotating sites on New Year’s Eve with the
winners of each game earning the right to
play for the top spot the following Monday

Finally, a plan that actually makes sense.

And it not only makes sense for the sake
of the game, but for fans and most impor-
tantly, television.

Is it a coincidence that only four of the
16 national championship games since the
inception of the BCS have been decided by
less than ten points?’

When scores such as 55-19, 41-14 or most
recently, 42-14 are the end result of putting
the nation’s two “best teams” together on
the same ﬁeld, what kind of service is the
college football world giving to fans on its
biggest stage?

Thankfully, the thought that an unde-
feated squad from some conference you may
or may not have heard of can be handed a
bid by a computer is only a worry we must
have for one more season. P

Nirschl will lead the team both in the
field and up at the plate. Last season, the
then-freshman was named the Big East
Conference’s Rookie of the Year. This was
the first time any Pitt member received
this recognition.

She lead the team, and the Big East, in
almost every offensive category with her
.333 batting average, 35 runs scored, 52
hits, 11 home runs andg27 RBIs.‘

With her power numbers, Nirschl is
already on pace to shatter Stevens’ all-
time home run record of 34 long balls in

a career.

Nirschl thought of her award as not an
individual achievement, but something
that can aid the team in the upcoming
season.

“It was a huge honor to win that award
this year. But to be completely honest, I
want to put that behind me and keep look-
ing forward and improving,” Nirschl said.

Accompanying Nirschl’s success at the
plate will be juniors Carissa Throckmorton
and Carly Thea.

Throckmorton hit .291, the second-
best clip on the team, and also provided
some pop with five home runs. Thea hit
for .248 average and ended the season
tied for second among all Panthers with
19 runs scored.

On the defensive side, Pitt had its ups
and downs. The downs were no more ob-
vious than in the 76 errors committed
last season. ’

The Panthers know this is something
that needs to be worked on. Six Panthers
ﬁnished 2013 with eight errors or more.

something goes wrong so we can pull to-

Men’s soccer struggled through second half

Tyler Pecyna
Stcyj’ Wrz'ter

It is awfully difficult to look at the Pitt men’s
soccer season from 2012 and not recall the
classic Charles Dickens line, “It was the best
of times, it was the worst of times.”

After starting the season undefeated
through its ﬁrst eight games, registering
six wins and two ties, the team lost its re-
maining nine contests. Despite the drastic
increase in the loss column, 2012 was not a
tale of two seasons for the Panthers injohn
Cordier’s mind.

“I wouldn’t look at it like that,” Cordier, a
senior defender and last year’s team captain,
said. “The competition got better, and we
were unable to adjust.”

Against former conference opponent
Cincinnati, Pitt suffered its ﬁrst loss of 2012
in a game that served as a microcosm for the
rest of theseason and an appropriate cessa-
tion of the team’s tenure as a member of the
Big East. The Panthers surrendered a goal
within two minutes before the end of the
ﬁrst half and ultimately lost the contest, 1-0.

“That was the ﬁrst game that Alex Har-
rison  came back [from an injury], and it
was kind of [a struggle] just adjusting to new
personnel on the ﬁeld,” Cordier said of the
loss to the Bearcats on September 22. “When
new guys come into the starting lineup, it

takes a few games to get a ﬂow together,
to be comfortable playing with each other.
Unfortunately it was a difﬁcult time of the
year to have to have that adjustment made.”

Head coachjoe Luxbacher conﬁrmed that
injuries, above all other factors, derailed the
team’s progress after a torrid start.

“We could always play better,” said Lux-
bacher, who is entering his 30th season at
the helm of Pitt men’s soccer. But, as Lux—
bacher said, losing both of the team’s start-
ing central defenders to injury took its toll.
Harrison broke a bone in his face, and Alex
Fischetti suffered a concussion: two setbacks
that caused the lineup to be shuffled right as
the team entered conference play.

Such dismay in Pitt’s defensive standing
is displayed in the score book. Through its
ﬁrst eight matches, the team allowed just six
goals. Through the ﬁnal nine — all of which
were against Big East clubs —— opponents
tallied 31 goals. _

“We weren’t deep enough,” Luxbacher
said. “One area we could not afford serious
injury was center back, and that [position]
is where we had both guys get hurt. It sort
of fell apart down the stretch defensively.”

If the defense struggled to harmonize
without Harrison and Fischetti, then surely
Pitt will continue to write a similar story
in 2013, having lost both players, as well
as former starting goalie Lee Johnston, to

transfer.

“Not at all,” Cordier promptly and conﬁ-
dently asserted, as if he refused to consider
the idea that a lack of defensive conﬁdence
could permeate the team’s play. “[Defenders]
Emilio Cordero, Andrew Wright and Kevin
Fielden all contributed a lot both in the fall
and in the spring.” K

Cordier said that those three sopho-
mores, who received the majority of game
minutes in spring action, will ﬁll in admira-
bly for the players lost to transfer because
the critical period of growth in college soccer
occurs between the ﬁrst and second year
with a team.

The senior defender added that he is
hopeful about sophomore goalie Dan Lynd,
who will take over forjohnston as the team’s
starting keeper.

“Dan’s a terriﬁc goalie. He’s proven him-
self this spring to deﬁnitely be worthy of a
starting spot in the fall,” Cordier said.

In fact, Lynd’s spring performance caught
the attention of another Panther senior.
Ryan McKenzie echoed the praise of Lynd,
saying the sophomore goalie has been “in-
credible this spring.”

According to Cordier, this year’s spring
exhibition matches featured the best de-
fensive efforts the senior has seen during
his Pitt career, highlighted by the stingily
low number of goals yielded by the Pan-

thers. Lynd was a key part of the effort that
generated just a 1-0 loss to the Pittsburgh
Riverhounds, a local professional team, and
a 0-0 draw against West Virginia in scrim-
mage play.

“That’s huge, knowing we have a goalie
behind us that’s going to be there for us
every game. I’m excited to play in front of
him,” McKenzie said.

Should Lynd need to be spelled, the Pan-
thers have a viable backup option in fresh-
man recruit Braden Horton.

Cordier emphasized the depth at the
keeper position and acclaimed Horton, a
product of the D.C. United Academy. He said,
“Either of [Horton or Lynd] are more than
capable of playing and excelling at this level.”

A deep roster is a large part of the reason
coach Luxbacher has little worry that Pitt
will encounter a similar downward spiral,
should injuries emerge in 2013.

“One of the things that hurt us last fall
is that we just weren’t real deep at a couple
spots, so certain injuries would be devastat-
ing, and that’s what happened. We should
be deeper in the midﬁeld, in the backs, and
even the center backs will be deeper than
last year,” Luxbacher said.

As the Panthers transition to the ACC
this year, they will ﬁnd their depth to be

WC3MEN’S SQCCER

Women's soccer: Team starts hot but falters late in year

Tyler Pecyna
S tczff W riter

In last fall’s West Virginia 90 Minute Classic, Pitt
women’s soccer lost both of its matches —— 1-0
to Miami and 3-0 to Penn State.

But, what does not show up in those ﬁnal
scores is the beneﬁt of exposure.

While both results were unfavorable to a
team that had won four of its ﬁrst ﬁve games of
the 2012 season, the losses served as valuable
lessons for Pitt’s future as a member of the ACC
in the upcoming campaign.

In Miami, the Panthers got a sample of
competition against an actual ACC school and
battled the Hurricanes to a tough—fought over-
time loss.

“Now that we have a little bit of a taste of
what Miami’s like, that will help us going into
the ACC quite a bit,” second—year Pitt head coach
Greg Miller said. “We’re really trying to just
teach the players the kinds of things that are
necessary to break teams down at that talent
level, and also to stop them.”

In Penn State, though, Pitt lined up against
one of such talented squads and learned ﬁrst-
hand the type of dominance apowerhouse pro-
gram can unleash. The Nittany Lions were the
runners-up for the NCAA national title, which
was captured by North Carolina.

The Tar Heels are just one of several pro-
grams in the ACC that boast an upper echelon

Redshirt junior goalie Nicole Diixgostino is
not too concerned with the September result
against Penn State, but instead she found value
in maintaining conﬁdence before so-called
“David-and—Golia ”matchups.

“We can’t be nervous when we play [tal-
ented] teams,” D’Agostino said. “That was our
biggest problem.” ~

She said the team would be intimidated" by
highly ranked opponents and saw the game as a
mismatch. But after competingwith Penn State
— and even matching its total of 10 shots — the
Panthers realized that they are not as disad-
vantaged as the numbers on paper may show.

After the game, Miller praised the team’s
efforts and relentlessness.

“I’m really proud of the team for displaying
that ﬁghting spirit,” Miller said in a press‘re—
lease. “They never stopped believing. Eventually
that belief will pay off with resul .”

Unfortunately the results were not tangible

Pitt athletes excel throughout the decades

Pat McAteer
Editor in C/zzkf

Throughout its history, Pitt sports programs
have produced a number of tremendously
successﬁil athletes in a wide range of sports.

; Although it doesn’t have the reputation of col-

lege athletic programs like Southern Califor-
nia and Florida, it has been one of the most
underrated factories of professional athletes
inthe country.

to Pitt football and unpredictable for Pitt bas-
,-lgetball—the University’s two most recogniz-
~ able athletic programs—as awhole, the history

berg’s record of 1,957 yards. Unfortunately V

for teams’ opposing defenses, Dorsettwas just
getting started. * _

During his junior season, he had 303 rush-
ing yards in a game, breaking his own school
record for a single game rushing performance.
But itwas Dorsett’s senior season that cement-
ed hisplaceas a Pitt legend.

Leading Pitt to the 1976 national champi-
onship, Dorsett rushed for 1,948 yards, the
best mark in college football yet again. His
accomplishments earned him the Heisman
Trophy—college football’s most prestigious
award—making him Pitt’s only honoree. He
was also received the Maxwell Award and Wal-
ter Camp Award for college football’s most
outstanding player. He’s widely considered
one of the greatest running backs in college
football history.

Dorsett was drafted second overall by the
Dallas Cowboys in the 1976 NFL Draft and went
on have a Pro Football Hall of Fame career,
rushing for 12,739 yards and 77 touchdowns
in 12 seasons.

Don Hennon

Don Hennon is probably the best college
athlete in Pitt’s storied history who never pur-
sued a career in professional sports. Between
1956 and 1959, Hennon was named an All-
American twice.

One of the deﬁning moments of this ca-

reer came against Duke in 1957, when Hennon

‘scored 45 points despite playing in an erawhen

the three point line didn’t exist. Despite play-
ing in an era before freshman were allowed
to play varsity in college, Hennon remains in
ﬁfth place on the all—time leading scorers list
at Pitt with 1,841 points. This proliﬁc scoring
ability landed him a spot in the Helm’s Athletic

O Foundation’s Basketball Hall of Fame.

Though he was drafted 41st overall in the
NBA'Draft by the Cincinnati Royals, Hennon
opted to instead pursue a career in medicine,
earning his degree from Pitt’s Medical School

" in 1963 and later becoming a surgeon in the

U.S. Army.

Glenn Scobey “Pop” Warner

Though he didn’t play at Pitt, Warner’s ac-
complishments as the coach of Pitt’s football
team and his contributions to the sport of
football are absolutely worthy of recognition.

Between 1915 and 1923, Warner ﬁnished

lwith a record of 60-12-4, winning national

championships in 1915, 1916 and 1918. During

“ his tenure, the team rattled off 33 wins at one

point, establishing itself as one of the premier
teams of college football’s early days.
Warner also provided a number of innova-
tions to the game of football, including the
screen pass, the spiral punt, single and double
wing formations and the use of shoulder and
thigh pads. Warner concluded his career at

Stanford, where his teams played in three Rose
Bowl games.

Warner ended his career with 319 wins
and 106 losses.

john Woodruff

Before the end of his freshman season at
Pitt, Woodruff was likely a bit preoccupied. He
faced a huge upcoming test: The 1936 Berlin
Olympics.

During the Olympic games in Nazi Germa-
ny, Woodruff became the ﬁrst African Ameri-
can gold medalist afterwinning the 800—meter
ﬁnal. He did this despite fallingfar behind after
a number of runners boxed him in.

Woodruff’s Gold medal is currently on dis-
play on the Hillman Library’s ﬁrst ﬂoor near
the main entrance.

Hailing from Westmoreland, Jamaica,

MOMENTS

Pat McAteer
Editor in Chief

Whether it’s a dramatic upset or a resound-
ing, program—changing win, Pitt sports have
treated Panther fans to some memorable mo-
ments. Shockingly enough for new Pitt sports
fans, the teams were once consistently domi-
nant——particularly the football team, which is
now known around campus as the only team
thatcan defy expectations in terms of disap-
pointment on a yearly basis.

Fortunately, Pitt fans haven’t forgotten the
good moments; they’re burned into the collec-
tive memories of the fanbase—even for those
who weren’t present during these moments
of glory.

Here’s a list of Pitt sports top ﬁve greatest
moments, starting with number five.

5. Pitt basketball takes down Connecticut

In 2009, Coachjamie Dixon had assembled
the best Pitt basketball team to ever play in
Oakland. With stars such as Dejuan Blair, Sam
Young and Levance Fields, the team dominated
its opponents, ﬁnishing 31-9.

But its two most memorable victories are
against Big East Conference foe Connecticut,
who held college basketball’s number one
ranking before facing Pitt at the XL Center in
Hartford, CT on Feb. 16. The Panthers physi-
cally dominated the Huskies, winning 76-68
and claiming the number one ranking for the

ﬁrst time in school history in the next week’s
rankings.

Pitt wasn’t ﬁnished with Connecticut, how-
ever. After losingtheir number one ranking over
a week later due to a loss against Providence,
Pitt again laid a beat—down on Connecticut-at
the Petersen Events Center, handing them a
70-60 loss in the ﬁnal regular season game of
the season.

After falling to West. Virginia in the third
round of the Big East Tournament, Pitt received
a number one seed in the NCAA Tournament,
advancing to the Elite Eight before losing on a
last second basket to Villanova.

4. Send it, Jerome! ‘

Onjanuary 25, 1988, duringanationally tele-
vised game against Providence at the Fitzgerald
Fieldhouse, Pitt forwardjerome Lane received
a pass from point guard Sean Miller and went
up for a dunk over a Providence player. As he
slammed the ball down, the backboard’s glass
shattered, causing ESPN announcer Bill Rafferty
to famous exclaim: “Send it in, Jerome!”

The play instantly became an iconic moment
in Pitt sports history. ESPN still recognizes the
event on a yearly basis, and during last year’s
“Midnight Madness” event, where Pitt opened
their practice season on a hardcourtinfront of
the Cathedral of Learning, Rafferty and current
members of Pitt’s basketball team re—lived the
play, with former Pitt forward].J. Moore playing

3. Pitt football beats Penn State in ﬁnal
meeting

Pittsburgh Post—Gazette sports columnist
Ron Cook once said that former Penn State
football coach would go to his grave haunted
by the outcome of his team’s ﬁnal match—up
against Pitt, one of its ﬁercest rivals at the time.

Based largely on the efforts of Pitt wide re-
ceiver Rod Rutherford, Pitt beat Penn State up
and down the ﬁeld at Pitt Stadium, winning
12-0. Though the rivalry has nowbeen restored,
with the Nittany Lions facing off against the
Panthers at Heinz Field in 2016, the game re-
 an iconic moment in a rivalry that was
once considered one of the best in the country.

2. 13_9 / j {

In Oakland, the streets caught ﬁre, with
students burning couches in Central Oakland,
imitating the antics of WVU fans. Although
their conduct shouldn’t be condoned, it was a
memorable night in Oakland, to say the least.

1. Pitt football wins the 1976 National 
pionship ' .

Considering the state of Pitt football, it’s .
hard to imagine that the program was once
one of the country’s best. But in 1976, with the
help of quarterback Matt Cavanaugh and run-
ningback Tony Dorsett, the Panthers won often
and big. V ’ . 

After anundefeated regular season, Pittwas
chosen to play Georgiainthe Sugar Bowl, a game
that would likely decide the national champion
since the ﬁrst—ranked Panthers faced a second-
ranked Georgia.  ; ~

Pitt left no questions unanswered.

The Panthers dominated the contest, win-
ning 27-3 and claiming the top rank in the As.-
sociated Press and Coach’s Poll. Though Coach

Johnny Majors left at the ended of the season
to coach at Tennessee,lthe team would remain
one of the country’s best through 1986 under
Majors’s assistant,Jackie Sherill. I

team that produced only 14 goals in 19 games in
2011, but for the defense to struggle under its
ﬁrst year skipper was more shocking.

In his 11 seasons with Ohio State, Millerwas
renowned as a defensive specialist. The Buck-
eyes, during his tenure, boasted their four best
seasons in program history in terms of goal
prevention.

' The Panthers improved in that same cat-
egory in 2012 and their 7-10-2 record was a
substantial leap forward from the 2—13—4 mark a
year before — positives that Ditxgostino attributes
to the fresh coaching staff.

“The [new coaching staff] came in and knew
what they wanted to do,” she said. “They had a
set game plan and everybody bought into what
they were trying to tell us.”

1 For senior defender Morgan Sharick, the
progression was a matter of putting a dismal
2011 in the past.

“After having the season that we had [two
years ago], nobody wanted to feel that disap-
pointment ever again,” said Sharick, who was
named ateam captain forthe upcoming season.
“We looked at this past season as a brand new
opportunity to get the results we wanted.”

Aside from the increase in win total, the

‘ Panthers secured a reliable option in the net

in Ditxgostino. The redshirt junior started all
19 games for Pitt and recorded the team’s ﬁrst
shutout since Aug. 28, 2011.

7 The Panther netminder said she can build "

on that success by “going into [the season] with
the mentality of trying to get a shutout every
game and trusting my defense.” V
. "’ A reciprocal faith is evident between the
defensive’ line and the goalie behind it, as Shar-
ick spoke highly of D’Agostino and explained
the boost in conﬁdence added by having that
stability between the pipes.

. . “Having a keeper like Nicole behind me who

 proven time_and time again that she can ‘

clean up the messes we make as a defensive

.  game in front of me,” she said.
If Sharick’s mind is less concerned about the

‘ team’s last line of defense, Pitt’s offense could

become exponentially more dangerous. The
senior defender excelled as an aerial threat on
comer kicks, and could occasionally join the
 on the ﬂy for incoming crosses as op-
posed to limiting her involvementto set pieces.

 

A key factor in Sharick’s four header goals
— which marked a school record for career and
season goals off of comers — was midﬁelder
Roosa Arvas.

Arvas, who paced the team with 14 points
and eight assists in 2012, is Pitt’s go—to free kick
taker. While her role as the offensive maestro

will remain intact, Arvas’s teammates and

coaches anticipate more ﬁnishes for the Finn-
ish sophomore. '

Miller credited Arvas for quickly adapting
to not only a different style of play but aforeign
culture as well, an adjustment that allows for the
expansion of-her game in the upcoming year.

“We spent a lot of time with [Arvas] in the
spring tryingto get hermore comfortable with
how we want her to play, so we can see more
things from her,” he said. “I deﬁnitely believe we

should see more from herfromamore complete
game standpoint — from ball—winning, defend-
ing, attacking.” -

The main assets ofArvas’ game trended posi-
tively in Pitt’s spring scrimmages, in which the
team ﬁnished with two wins and two losses.
Arvas served another successful corner that
was ﬁnished by Sharick in a 1-0 victory over
Marshall and ﬁnished a goal of her own in a 3-1
triumph over Pitt’s alumni squad.

Also making her way onto the score sheet
against the -alumni was redshirt junior Alex
Charlebois. Like Arvas, Charlebois experienced
herﬁrst season of Pitt soccer in 2012 — after she
transferred from Missouri — and entered with
a bang. Her ﬁve goals led the team and her 12
points were second—most behind Arvas’s total.

Coach Miller said he sees Charlebois further-

ing that success and that she is poised to break
out this year — a much needed shot in the arm
for a growing offensive attack.

“We saw great ﬂashes of [her talent] last
year at the beginning of the year and at the end

of year, and she kind of had a little bit of a lull "'

during the middle of the year,” he said. “We
talked alittle bit about her consistency and be-
ing more impactful everyday in training and in
games. It’s not always about scoring goals and
getting assists from her — but just being more

dangerous in the attack.” ,_

With what looks to be ablossoming tandem

turn a promising core of players to be boosted by

Professional sports scene
in Pittsburgh offers three

The Pittsburgh Pengins hav enjoy
professionai teams. MCT Campus

Jonathan Coltogirone
Staff Writer

Ifsomeone asked me how to describe the profes-
sional sports scene in the city of Pittsburgh, I’d
have to compare the trifecta of teams to that of
one big, happy family.

The blood of Pittsburgh sports teams and
their fans runs deep, and successful seasons in

. recent years have invigorated a fan base that

harbors an equal passion for all three teams.
The passion has equated to success at the
. highest level, as evidenced by Sporting News’
decision to name Pittsburgh the Best Sports City
in North America in 2009, following champi-
onship seasons for the Steelers and Penguins.
The Pittsburgh Pirates, the oldest of the three
franchises, were founded in 18 82 and have won
ﬁve World Series titles in their decorated his-
tory, but none since 1979 when the Pirates took
down the Baltimore Orioles in the World Series.
~ The Pirates have dropped off signiﬁcantly in
production in the past few decades, failing to

reachthe .500 markinevery season since 1992. ‘

Despite a relatively poor on—ﬁeld product in
recent seasons, the resurgent bunch play their
home games in one of the best venues in the
country, PNC Park located on the North Shore.

, Both FOXSports.com and Trip Advisor have
recently named PNC Park the best ballpark in
Major League Baseball.

most success recently among Pittshurglfs

 
 
 

   

There are plenty of diehard Pirate fans that
have stuck around, despite suffering through
two dreadful decades of baseball. When the
Pirates win, the stadium is nearly full and the
atmosphere is as good as any inbaseball. 
the Pirates are losing, well, at least the skyline
of Pittsburghwill always be present just beyond
the right ﬁeld wall.

The second oldest franchise of the three is
the Pittsburgh Steelers. Born in 1933, the Pitts-
burgh Steelers have won more Super Bowls than
any other team inNFL history. On six occasions
since 1974 the black and gold have hoisted the
Lombardi Trophy at the end of the NFL season,
with their most recent championships coming in
2007 and2009. The Rooney family has owned
the Steelers since the team was established and

continue to promote a tradition of profession-
alism and success. The franchise is widely ge-
spected and commonly touted as one of the
best-run professional sports teams inthe world.

The Steelers dominate the culture in western
Pennsylvania, which is why the area is often
called “Steeler Country.” ASunday duringfo_’dt-

’""“new conference is widely regarded as the

most competitive from top to bottom, the
Big East was no slouch. In 2012, eight Big
East schools advanced to the 48-team NCAA
tournament. The ACC was the second—most
represented conference, with five clubs

,.,,;,§eaching the postseason.

“We have to be talented, but we have to
be deep too,” Luxbacher said. “[The team
is] not going to get by playing with 11 or 12
guys every game over a 20-game schedule.
Injuries happen, guys get worn down. You
need depth.”

Pitt’s uninspiring Big East record last
year (0-8) has certainly not dented several
players’ conﬁdence entering a fresh cam-
paign in a new conference.

“It’s not going to be easy [playing in the
ACC], but I truly believe this year’s team is

‘raga team that’s capable of making the [confer-

ence] tournament and being competitive,”
McKenzie, a forward, said. “I’m sure there
will be ups and downs, but this team + more
than in my years past — is a team capable
of making great strides and a big jump.”

As McKenzie said, there are peaks and
valleys in every season, but both he and
Cordier were quick to acknowledge the same
moment from last year, which they regarded
as the team’s pinnacle.

On September 14, Pitt trailed Northern

Within the next few minutes, then—freshman
forward Nick Wysong brought the Panthers
to within a goal. After Wysong buried an-
other score in the 76th minute, which tied
the game, he completed the hat trick and
secured the Panther comeback to down the
visiting opponents, 3-2.

Wysong, now a sophomore, is one of
those players entrenched in his area of
critical growth and is expected to build on
a promising start to his career. Last year he
led the team with 13 points, and his ﬁve goals
tied him with fellow forward Nico Wrobel
for the most among the Panthers.

Wrobel, a native of Germany, will enter
his senior season teamed with McKenzie to
establish a veteran forward presence up top.
The attacking depth mirrors the solid base
found at other positions and contributes to
an overall continuity that Cordier sees being
the key to success in 2013.

“Basically what it all comes down to is
the whole team buying in to one mentality,
one game plan,” he said.

And if anything this spring has indicated
that the team is moving collectively in that
direction, it has come after practices.

“Everyone’s serious, comes in and wants
to get better each day,” Cordier said. “In our
conditioning, several times over the spring
our strength coach would be done, we’d ﬁn-
ish the workout he had in mind, and the

.whole team would do extra runs together

just to push ourselves that much more.” i

Last year, Wickman tallied 30 victories

 

 
   
     
   

and was named team co-MVP while playing
fourth singles and third doubles. This past
season Wickman tallied 40 victories, the
most notable coming in a doubles match
against Penn State, where Amanda paired
with her sister Molly. Amanda was an im-

ries in singles play were the most victories
on the team.

Swimming and Diving

Head coach: Chuck Knoles

Player to watch: Kourosh Ahani.

Ahani was one of the most success-
ful athletes on campus this year. The ris-
ing junior from Toronto was undefeated
this season in the 100 fly, won a Big East
Conference title and swam in the NCAA
regionals. Ahani recently participated .in
the Canadian World Championship, during
which he placed second in the men’s 100 ﬂy
preliminaries. His time of 54.58 advanced
him to the men’s 100 ﬂy ﬁnals, in which
he placed fourth overall.

Final results: The men posted a record
of 7-2 while the women ﬁnished 7-3. The
men’s team saw three individuals win Big
East champions while 16 school records
were set at the Big East Championship meet
this season. On the women’s end, Kelsey
Herbst and Kourosh Ahani swam at the
NCAA national championship meet. The
men’s team will bring back the most valu-
able swimmer and diver in 2014, when the
team will try and improve on the succ'ejs‘s’

sight for a team run by Miller.

In 2011, Ohio State graduated a class of
nine seniors who set a school record with 51
career victories. If Pitt’s incoming freshman
class, which features talents from across the
national and international pool and is decorated
with state andnational titles, has a shot at ap-
proachingasirnilar status, it needs to startwith
a winning ﬁrst year.

could also be similar, given their comparable
competitive drive and winning backgrounds.

But any thoughts of that record are put on
hold for now as Pitt hopes its incomingfreshmen
mesh with the veteran players to gain ground
on the top college clubs, a plan that Sharick sees
con1ing to fruition after a solid spring. 

“As a team, we implemented some important
things into our game this spring that we must
carry into the upcoming season,” she said. “If
we do that, and utilize the help from the incom-
ing freshman class, I think that we have great
potential to succeed in the fall.” 3

aiid die with theirfootball team and are widely
considered some of the greatest fans in sports.
5 5'3? The beloved Steelers also play at aﬁrst—class
venue on the North Shore, Heinz Field, which
is located next to PNC Park. They also hap-
pen to share this stadium with the Pittsburgh
"Panthers football team, who take the ﬁeld on
Saturdays in the fall. The Steelers will always
be number one in the hearts of Pittsburghers
when it comes to sports.

'- 5 The youngest franchise of the trio is the
Pittsburgh Penguins. The Penguins boast the
newest venue in the city, with Consol Energy
‘Center being erected just outside of downtown
Pittsburgh less than three years ago. Established
in 1967, the Penguins won two Stanley Cups
in the early ‘90s and one more in 2009. The
Pens are becoming one of the most success-
ful franchises in the NHL and were on pace to
bhcome the most—watched professional team in
the United States that wasn’t a part of the NFL.
A .‘ A terrible stretch in the early 2000s almost
led the Penguins to leave the city until Penguins
 of Famer Mario Lemieux decided to be-

, come part owner of the team. Lemieux saved

 franchise and is, arguably, the sole reason
 team is still in Pittsburgh. Last season, a
lslgatue of Lemieux from his playing days was
 in front of the Consol Energy Center to
honor “Super Mario,” as he is known.

All three teams sport “black and gold,”
though the Steelers and Pirates really use more
of a yellow color. This similarity makes it easy for
just about everyone in the area to be supportive
of all of three teams, or at least it seems like it
from a distance. A town that has basked in the
shadows of steel mills, now is a professional
sports ﬁxture on a national level. V

At times it is nearly impossible to get your
hands on Steelers or Penguins tickets and, if you
do, they’ll cost you a pretty penny. Not to say
that the atmosphere or product isn’t worth the
money, because it certainly is, just that it really
is difficult to ﬁnd someone willing to give up
tickets for an event.

For those new to the Pittsburgh area, Iwould
suggest attending a Pirate game as soon as pos-
sible to get a taste of the sports scene in town.
The tickets are relatively cheap and easy to come
by. Get to the game early so that you can enjoy
the elecn°ic atmosphere outside of the stadium,
both in the parking lot and downtown. Native
Pittsburghers will be grilling dogs and ﬂipping
burgers, dousing everything in Heinz ketchup
and washing it all down with Iron City beer.

The city ofPittsburgh is often acknowledged
as one of the greatest sports cities in the country
and its team’s fans are as passionate as any.
The citizens of this great town are friendly and

welcoming as long as you’re wearing the right

‘colors. Walk into Heinz Field wearing purple

_ and black or into Consol Energy Center draped

in orange and white and I can’t promise that
same hospitality. a

accomplish two goals: providing interesting

‘material for you to learn and building skills

you need for the future.

One of these skills is writing. The sorts of
ideas that can be developed and expressed
in an essay are different than those that can
be developed and expressed on an exam or

43-, gain a classroom discussion, and it is far from

evident that engaging in one type of activity
sufficiently prepares students for the other.

More importantly, writing lends perma-
nence to our language and thereby offers
our greatest window into our own thoughts
while simultaneously forcing us to create

something that is new. We are able to hone
an important life skill and develop critical
thinking skills at the same time.

Unfortunately, despite the merits of writ-
ing, it’s a skill that isn’t always taught in non-
humanities classes at Pitt.

To remedy this, I suggest ensuring that
at least one class each semester has signiﬁ-
cant writing responsibilities and assuming
an editor or writer position with some Pitt
publication like The Pitt News.

Finally, the ultimate exercise of these skills
is in independent research. This literalizes
the project that critical‘and creative think-
ers should strive toward. On the frontiers
of knowledge, there’s nobody to mimic or
disassemble: We must create our own truth.

According to Richard Arum, a professor of
education at New York University, andjosipa
Roksa, an associate professor of education at
the University of Virginia, there was no gain
in cognitive skills for 36% of students over
all four years of college. At Pitt, it’s not too
difficult to become part of this demographic,
but it’s also easy to learn something. Real
learning requires initiative and proactive de-
cision making in developing a path towards
an education. In the end, I merely hope you
consider the purpose of your education as
you navigate the new, strange world of the
University.

Happy learning! I

SOPHILTHY

Irealized the mistake I made, started lightly
jogging (sprinting) in my weather—inappro—
priate outﬁt, and ﬁnally made it to Victoria. I
noticed that the class was on the third ﬂoor,
so I decided to take the stairs — rookie move:
whatever ﬂoor your class is on, if you take
the stairs in Victoria, and actually reach your
destination, it would feel as if you climbed the
Himalayas. Twice.

Showing up barely on time, panting and
looking like I was in no mood to socialize, I
didn’t get to use my college-friend pick up.-
lines— ~ “what’s your major‘? Where are you?
from?” — because everyone else seemed to
be already acquainted with each other. Maybe’.
they knew each otherfrom the elevator ride up;

I lost my ﬁrst day of school by the time _I
got to my third class of the day, and by the
ﬁfth (I really don’t recommend anyone taking.
this many classes in one day. I don’t know why
my advisors let me) I felt like I had just come
from battle. ' '

Taking into account my bad luck and con-
sequential general air of awkwardness, don’t
let the story scare you or persuade you to think
that the ﬁrst day has no potential to be quite

' a pleasant day. But if there was one thing I

could tell myselflooking back, it’s that the ﬁrst
day expectations will basicallycset you up for
disappointment. ' L
The biggest myths of the ﬁrst day are that it
will go to the plan we envision in our heads,or
give you an indication of how the school year

is going to run. The truth is, it’s pretty much .

beyond our control when and how we get into
a routine and ﬁnally feel in place — it might
take some longer than others.

You talk to so and so person here, you end
up at this event with someone else; it doesn’t
follow the icebreakers strategies you learn
in Pittstart. As soon as we get that cinema-
induced plan out of our heads, it starts to fall
into place. You’ll ﬁnd your friends in the most
random, out-of~your-direct—control way, and
probably end up being very surprised by a
class or two you take.

And don’t worry, you will have plenty of
time to use your college pick up lines (I shame-
lessly still use them) and perfect your outfits
and show up to class looking cool, collected,
and in breath (maybe this will be my year for
that). -

It’ll ‘be bittersweet to go through my last
real ﬁrst day this August, considering I feel
like I’ve perfected them up until this point.
But, for those of you going through your ﬁrst".
one soon, bask in the glory of not having.’ to
expect anything, and if it’s terrible, remember
it so you can tell strangers about it one day. I‘-
