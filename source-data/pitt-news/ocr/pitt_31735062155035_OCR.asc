Homecoming Decision Due  

Banners Approved

By JACK! KATZ
A proposal for the fraternities and sororities to build
Homecoming banners from chicken wire and napkins was
passed by Interfraternity Council Wednesday night. The
proposal, presented by Richard Minker, will now be taken

to -each fraternity for approval. _ _
' If seven or more fraternities agree to build a banner

the proposal will be passed. If less than seven accept it,
however, there will be none. Fraternities must report the action taken
by their house by Tuesday, Norman Himes, IFC president, announced.
There is a ﬁve dollar registration fee for the banners.

The banners, which will be eight feet by eight feet, must be
built in two sections of four feet by eight feet each. Two styrofoam
ﬁgures will be allowed on the banner and the chicken wire may be
formed against the wooden frame of the banner to present a three
dimensional effect. A limit of $30 per fraternity for construction
was decided upon for each banner.

Individual Banners

Sororities and fraternities will work individually on the ban-
ners and they will be judged separately.

The banners must be in good taste, according to Hismes. and
should have the fraternity name and the slogan on it. Theme
for Homecoming is “Famous Firsts.”

feated. Al Moye, assistant to the
director of men’s housing, ex-
plained to the Council that he

member to engage in house
sports. He said that he felt that

 Editorial: carving Out a

Policy

John Vrana appealed to Vice-Chancellor Alan Rankin last week in desperation. All
the date tickets for the Navy and the Not re Dame Homecoming game were gone and
Athletic Director Frank Carver seemed to be giving five different answers to every-
one who approached him about it. Couldn’t Dr. Rankin, as vice-chancellor of student
affairs, speak to Carver for them.

Dr. Rankin said he’d try but shrugged his shoulders. For what connection does
student affairs have with the Athletic Department at this University. Apparently not

too much.

Carver di'd come through with 300 date tickets for the Navy game tomorrow, at
three dollars each. And with 300 more for the Notre Dame game during Homecom-
ing weekend, at five dollars a seat. Both sets of tickets permit the holder to sit in
the student section with his date, and if there is an overflow, Carver beneficiently
remarked, they might open part of Section 14. These additional tickets, of course,
were given because the students needed them; the ﬁrst batch of date tickets for both
games has been sold out for some time. But. oddly enough, the first set of tickets for
the Notre Dame game cost $3.00 rather than the five dollars now charged for the

same admission.

Carver explained to one person that the date tickets sell for the same price as

"the cheapest seat in the stadium for that game. This might vary with the status of

the game and the size of the crowd it traditionally draws. For instance, William and
Mary date tickets cost $2.50, N otre Dame tickets, $5.00.

He told someone else that he’s now’ under contract to sell only $5.00 tickets for
the Notre Dame game since this second batch of date tickets i's above and beyond the

number usually alloted.

To add to the confusion, the people at the Student Desk in the Cathedral say that
date tickets always go on sale the Monday before that game. But tickets for both
Navy and Notre Dame were sold out weeks in advance. . _

We realize that the Athletic Department is in business, but we also understand
this division to fall under the broad category of the University of Pittsburgh where »
many students call the Panthers Their Team and all of them pay a University fee to

support Pitt Stadium.

Carver must re-evaluate the standards by which the student section and "date tick-
ets have been set up and make his new policy not only clear and consistent, but more

fair to the students.

Finding the Facts

Liberals Overlook Report

By ALEX D’IPPOLl'l0
It's a wonder that the lib-
erals, who so opening express

their love for the United Na-V

tions, have failed to read one
of the most important docu-
ments ever published by the
U.N. reﬂecting on United
- P  States foreign
policy; name-
ly the report
of the United
Nations Fact-
Finding Mis-
sion to South
Vietnam.
V This docu-
‘ ment sheds

D’lPP0Ll'l‘O light on how
the administration and Con-
gress were fooled into the
wrong policy in the Diem in-
cident.

Since this affair, state-
ments by Defense Secretary
Robert McNamara on‘ Viet-
na.m policy have shown that
the administration has not,
as Senator Goldwater has
charged, repented of its er-
ran ways and devised an
effective policy.

Only at the insistence of
Senator Thomas J. Dodd (D.-
Conn.) was this U.N. docu-
ment published by the Sen-
ate internal security subcom-
mittee.

THE INFORMATION con-
tained in the report made
Senator Dodd conclude that
under President Diem “the
accounts of massive persecu-
tion of the Buddhist religion
were, at best, vastly exag-
gerated, at the worst, a sor-
did propaganda fraud.”

The senator quoted Am-
bassador Fernando Volio Ji-
menez of Costa Rica, a mem-
ber of the mission, as saying,
“It is my personal feeling
that there was no policy of

 

“ discrimination, oppression,»
 ~or persecution. against the

33¢“ 53.“? 

 

 also. publicly . chastised, by

  
  
 

.13.i9.h sovsrnm

ligion.”

Ambassador Volio said
that based on the reports in
the press he had intended to
vote for the condemnation of
the Diem regime, but when
Diem invited the U. N. to
send its own observers to in-
vestigate, the ambassador
felt that it was only fair that
Diem’s offer be accepted.

The mission had access to
any witness, government of-
ﬁcial, or records that it de-
sired.

THE MISSION WAS also
signiﬁcant in that it was the
ﬁrst time in the history of
the U.N. that an on the spot
investigation of one of its
members was made.

Although the mission did
not go into the political mo-
tives of the Buddhist pro-
test, Senator Dodd felt that
the reason for the persecu-
tion charges against Diem
was found in a report by col-
umnist Marguerite Higgins.

Miss Higgins quoted Bud-
dhist leader Thich Tri
Quang, who took refuge in
the American embassy, as
saying, “We cannot get an
arrangement with the North
until we rid of Diem and
Nhu.”

And where were our poli-
cy makers when all this was
going on?

At the same time that
Madame Nhu, sister-in-law
of the staunchly anti-Com-
munist President Diem, was
touring the United States in
behalf of her brother-in-
1aw’s government. President
Kennedy was coexisting with
Communist boss Tito by win-
ing and dining him at the
White House.

Not only was Madame
Nhu ignored, but she was

 

    
    

“We have,” lamented Sen-
ator Dodd, “been the victim
of still another hoax . . .,”’
and he pondered, “how im-
portant American newspa-
pers could so mislead us in
these situations.”

UNFORTUNATE AS the ’

Diem incident may have
been, the really sad thing
about it was that our for-
eign policy pundits still had-
n’t come to grips with the
South Vietnam situation.

For about the last year
Defense Secretary McNa-
mara has been commuting
between Washington and Sai-
gon.

After his ﬁrst trip the sec-
retary said our boys would
be home by Christmas; after
the second journey he said
that we would be in South
Vietnam for the next ten
years; after his third pil-
grimage he said things were
going peachy and there
would be no need for a mil-
itary build-up; while after
the last time around he said
that a sizable increase of
men, money, and materials
was necessary.

With reporting like this
Lyndon Johnson should have
Henry Cabot Lodge tour
America rather than Europe
to explain our South Viet-
nam policies.

Americans, too, would like
to know what is going on.

WHEN SENATOR Gold-
water says that our policy
in South Vietnam is a mud-
dled mess he is shooting
from nothing but the facts.

When Goldwater charges
that we have not had, nor
do we presently have, an ef-
fective policy to achieve our
objectives in Vietnam (if we
still have any objectives re-

.maining) he is, unfortunate-
ly, describing the situation._.  1!!-rtin

Panel Settles Nothing

Instructors Must Help

By AL JANEZIC

I

The integrity panel at the recent “Why Not Cheat'i’

forum decided three things: “The younger generation is
not going to the ‘dogs ;” The University policy is “opposed
to academic dishonesty,” and “cheating is a long-range
problem that requires a long-range solution.”

Such announcements, however, are not very startling.
N 0 one believed that cheating was rocking the foundations
of the Cathedral. No one believed that the University

sanctioned academic dishonesty, and everyone knew that,

cheating is a long-range problem that’s been going on
since the school was built. The prob-
lem is: No one knows what the Uni-
versity intends to do about it.

The panel did not enlighten any-
one..Though they must have realized
that a smidgen of meaningful action
was possible, none resulted. Just

son to abandon anything simply be-
cause no permanent, fool-proof an-
swer seems evident.

But perhaps the panel could
meet again and put forth some con-
crete proposals. '

 

« JANEZIC
If they do, maybe they could divert their appeals

from the students to the professors. The educators, it

seems, hold the key to putting a crimp in cheating. We;
must let them know the students care as much as some- 9

one did last week when The Pitt News received a neatly
mimeographed anonymous copy of courses where cheat
ing was commonplace. The sheet cited courses by name,
number and instructor, covering all areas from English
to engineering.

To begin ‘with, no complex policy is needed. In fact,

only two preliminary steps can help very much: Urge’

professors to remain in classrooms as overseers during
an exam, and persuade them of the need to change exams
from trimester to trimester. ,

Such steps can both smite sloth and curb temptation.
And this is what’s needed as a start.

If the professors learn what the majority of students

expect of them, they can adapt to deal with the cheating,

minority. But if we just decide that cheating is a long-
range problem, we’ll be waiting a long time for a solution.

Interviews Show
Student Voting for
People, Not Policy

by Fred Frank

“This year we will be voting for people, plans and
policies” booms the stenatorian voice of Gregory Peck on
advertisements urging people to vote this year. It seems
those _University students who are registered will follow
th1_s dictum to a degree. They’re going to vote and they’re
going to vote for people. But plans and policies are for
some reason the furthest thing from their minds.

In a random sampling of stu-
dents passing in front of the Stu-
dent Union on Fifth Avenue, over
30 University students registered
to vote were interviewed to de-
termine the degree of political
awareness on campus.

If awareness means that Barry
Goldwater is running against
Lyndon Johnson or that Hugh
Scott's opponent is Genevieve
Blatt the voting student body
would come out with political

4.0. They also would graduate.

cum laude from a course whose
only test question was “Is Barry
Goldwater a conservative or a
liberal?”

Line for the Numusmatist

But if the students were asked
what policies make Goldwater a
conservative, what is his stand on
the United Nations or how he, has
voted on civil rights throughout
his Senate career many of them
would probably be on political
probation.

Team Teaching Proves Its elf Here

By MARIE KUKICH

Education students have long been impressed by a
new innovation—-team teaching—in which a group of ro-
tating teachers pool their knowledge and abilities. They
are not the only ones who are impressed, however. The
University’s Graduate School of Business Administration
has been using the system for three years in a required
course i'n its master’s degree (MBA) program and the

results have been exciting.
“Team teaching creates aware-
ness in the student,” explains Dr.
Bernard Bass, who heads the
group of three rotating lecturers
teaching the MBA course this
year. “One of the best things
about it,” he contends, “is that it
makes underachievers better
achievers. It has been proven
that team teaching helps schol-
astic performance better than
counseling.”
Three professors, each with
specialized talents, take turns
conducting the classes. After the
lectures, the students break down
into small “t” (for “training”)
groups for discussion and debate.
‘These small groups are the core
of the team‘ teaching pogram. The
members of the t-groups try, ﬁrst,
to understand themselves and,
later, to understand others in the
group and the motives behind

I their actions.

“The Goldﬁsh Bowl”

Irr addition, all of the t-groups
take part in “the Goldﬁsh Bowl.”
Each individual has the oppor-
tunity to observe other groups as
an outsider looking in. “The
Goldﬁsh Bowl” thus gives the
student a chance to see how he
would appear to others in the
same type of situation.

Since the group, or the small

business meeting, is the area of ‘I

central importance in the mod-
ern business world, the busi-
ness manager, to be successful,
must know how to deal with
people and to solve the prob-
lem of making group operation
more eﬂicient.

The manager studies motiva-
tions and tries to answer ques-
tions such as “Why do we like
some people more than others?“
or, “Why is it hard to communi-
cate with certain people?“

Dr. Bass, who is also adminis-
trator of the science center of
the Graduate School of Business
Administration, commented, “The
effectiveness of team teaching
has been proven at places such
as Harvard and the Massachu-
setts Institute of Technology. In
this course, team teaching offers
an experience in which people“
work together to solve interper-
sonal problems.”

Hair Today, Gone Tomorrow

girls watching the demonstration on the 11th ﬂoor of Holland Hall
and the entire University Community. By acclamation, Ellen Levitt
(left) and Peggy Timko were nominated the good-sports-of-the-day

Mr. Gene 0., professional hairdressers who also answered questions
on crises in “world of hairs,” such as straightening, setting, bleaching.

Jalbert Takes Job at Boston U.

Russell R. Jalbert, direc-
tor of public relations at the
University, has resigned to
accept the position of vice-
president for university af-
fairs at Boston University.

Harold C. Case, president
of Boston University, said
that Jalbert, who will as-
sume his new post in Janu-
ary, will “be responsible for
developing and executing
all policies to the univers-
ity’s internal and external
communications.”

Commenting on his new as-
signment, Jalbert stated, “The

new job represents a step up-
ward, with broader scope and
more responsibility.” He empha-
sized, “I leave the University
with very deep personal regret.
I am thoroughly convinced that
it is a superb institution.” He
went on to say that his over-
whelming personal and profes-
sional reasons for leaving formu-
lated his decision.

Jalbert came to the Univer-
sity in 1959 from a Rochester,
New York, advertising and
public relations ﬁrm. He has
held positions in public rela-
tions, advertising, and maga-
zine ﬁelds.

Extra Date Tickets Now on Sale
For Pitt - Notre Dame Game

Date tickets for the Pitt-Notre
Dame game are now available at
the Student Desk, ground ﬂoor
of the Cathedral, for ﬁve dollars,
according to Frank Carver, direc-
tor of athletics.

There were 300 date tickets
available at three dollars, a re-
duced rate, but all of these are
sold out. The student section at
the stadium was then extended

to include sections 14 through
17 and other tickets were placed
on sale.

“These additional date tickets
must be sold for ﬁve dollars,”
Carver explained, “because we
cannot break our contract with
Notre Dame for the tickets.” Stu-
dents who have date tickets, how-
ever, can sit in any part of the
student section.

University Undergraduate Runs

For Pennsylvaia

iv

31¢; BROTHER Barry watches . over State Senate
hopeful Andy Mcswigan (right). talking to Jay

‘ By EDWARD PECHAN

Andy McSwigan, a part-time under-
graduate at the University, has been inter-
ested in politics for just four years, yet he
is running for the State Senate. At 26,_he
is one of the youngest candidates running
in Pennsylvania.

McSwigan’s campaign office is located

just off campus, at 3954 Forbes Avenue,
across from the Student Union. He is running on
the Republican ticket from the 43rd district, which
includes all of Oakland, Squirrel Hill, South Side,
the Hill District, and Mount Oliver.

In that area, which encompasses the Univer-
sity campus, 82,000 of the 109,000 voters are Demo-
crats. Republicans running in (this area are usually
defeated, and Mcswigan concedes that he has an
uphill ﬁght. However, he and his over 100 volun-
teers are trying hard to “crack the city machine”
and gain a victory for the Republican party in this
Democratic stronghold.

McSwigan’s Platform

McSwigan is campaigmlng on a platform which
includes the elimination of the milk commission
and other bureaucracies in state government; the
support of civic improvements in'Oakland, such as
the University’s building program and the Panther
Hollow project; and “a more balanced policy” for
the state, which would stimulate new jobs and more
corporate activity.

Carver Explains Policy
On Football Plane Riders

Athletic Director Frank Carver reiterated Wednesday that the
Pitt Panther and the cheerleaders are -not allowed to travel to the

away football games on the team plane.

This statement came in response to a question by cheerleader
captain Richard Kaplan, who reﬁuested that the Pitt Panther be al.

allowed to go with the 'team on their plane.

Snyder and State Senator Jack McGre8'0l' 1!! M9-
Swiga.n’s Republican headquarters, Forbes Avenue.

Since he became interested in Political Sci-
ence through a course he took from Dr. Edward
Cook in 1960, Mcswigan has participated In Re-
publican party activities and in state pohtics.

McSwig.an has volunteered in a number of com- ~

paigns in the area. He has held a number of Re-
publican jobs: he was a county committeeman; a
judge of elections; treasurer of the fourth ward Re-
publicans; and is presently chairman of the fourth
ward Republicans.

State ,“Needs Youth”

“I feel that we need youth and responsibility
in our state government,” Mcswigan explains his
reason for running. He "also wants “to make an in-
road into the Democratic machine” and “to give
Republican representation to the people of this
area.”

A lifetime resident in the Oakland area, Mc-
Swigan attended Allegheny College for one year
before transfering to the University. He is now
a part-time student majoring -in political science
and he needs four credits to graduate. While he
attended the University full time he was a re-
porter for the Pitt News.

In hiscampaign, Mcswigan claims to have the
support of the business community: two of the mem-
bers of his election committee are Leslie B. Worth-
ington, president of U.S. Steel, and Allison R. Max-
well, Jr., president of Pittsburgh Steel.

Carver explained that this poli- '
cy has been in effect for at least
30 years. The only time the
cheerleaders went with the team
was to a bowl game, Carver ex-
plained, and that time a second
plane was chartered.

The team plane carries the
team and other people connected
with it. “I checked with our op-
ponents, and they all have the
same policy,” Carver said.

ed students to the question of
why they would vote for one or
the other of the presidential can-
didates point out one thing: most
students, even those most active
in the Democratic and Republi-
can campaigns, are either pro or
anti-Goldwater. Few will vote for
or against the policies of Lyn-
don Johnson.

Neither group seems to have
very lucid ideas about the policies
of their candidates or the opposi-
tion. At no time was anyone able
to give speciﬁc bills which their
candidates had supported or op-
posed besides the civil rights bill,
the tax cut, or medicare. Nor
could one student interviewed,
who would vote in the Pennsyl-
vania senatorial election cite
Hugh Scott’-s vote on the medi-
care bill.

‘No one knew, either, that a
ROTC (Reserve Officers Train-
ing Corps) revision bill had been
proposed or that Congress had
passed it, although the very
name of the bill should inter-
est .a great number of students

on campus. And ﬁve of those in- .

terviewed didn’t even know who
was running for the state legis-
lature in their district.
The same questions were also
posed to the leaders of both of
the political youth groups on cam-
pus. When a state wide leader of
the Young Citizens for Johnson
was asked what appealed to him
‘about Johnson’s foreign policy,
he stated that Johnson has a real-
istic appr h to foreign policy.”
“For le?”
“Well, In South East Asia.”

“What's he going to do 
South East Asia?” 

“Well, he’s going to
of there.” _

One of the state wide co-ordi- ll
nators for the Young Republicans, 
responded to the same queries.”d""

“South Vietnam is a stalemate ;
war. Senator Goldwater would‘;
let the South Vietnamese attack‘;
the North and give them tech-sf’
nical aid while they’re doing it.”’_?;

“How?” ‘

“Well, he doesn't have the  ..
curity information now to make;
those decisions.”

Another of the political lead-.:
ers interviewed admitted he was ;
going to vote for the re-e1ection ,
of his Congressman knowing

 Harriers Improve 
, Under Jim Banner

By BOBSIKIZIK

The transformation of the Panther cross-country
team from a perennial soft-touch to the leading team in
the East, is due to a combination of factors, the least
not lbeing the appointment of Jim Banner as interim
coac .

Banner is handling the team in the absence of Carl

Rees, who is recuperating from a heart attack suffered
last summer. Being only an interim coach has left Banner some-

what on the spot.

He feels if he takes any credit for the team’s success
he will be making Rees look bad. When asked about the
difference between this year's team, which is 5-0, and last
year's Rees coached squad which was 3-4, Banner said, “I’d
rather not answer that question.”

But the facts of this year’s team speak for Banner. The im-
provement was most evident in the Penn State meet of October
10. The Panthers thrashed the Lions, 19-36, although they lost
to them in 1963, 19-41. The Panthers have also beaten Ohio Uni-
versity, a team which soundly whipped them last year.

But coaching can onlygo so far. No coach can win without

_ good talent and Banner has that in abundance. The team’s

leading point-scorers are Damien Koch and John Bailey, but

these two have not been doing it alone. They have received ex-

cellent back-up support from Dave Eichenlaub, Don Hinchber-

ger and sophomores Fran Shore, Larry Hubner and Frank Han-
delman.

The way‘ the runners have placed so -far this year is
proof of the ability and depth of the team. Against Slippery
Rock, Koch Bailey. Handelman and Hubner all tied for first.
In the triangular meet with Kent State and Ohio U. the
team displayed its depth by taking the fourth, fifth, seventh
and ninth spots in the persons of Koch, Bailey, Hinchberger,
Shot, and Hubner, respectively.

Although Ohio U. and Kent State had individuals ﬁnish
ahead of the Panthers they could not match Banner’s team in
depth.

Top Eastern Quarterbacks
Clash at Stadium Tomorrow

(Continued from Page 12.)

The game was also supposed to be the game which helped to de-
cide the Eastern Championship. The Lambert Trophy ratings don’t
agree. The Panthers are rated fourth while Navy is rated eighth in
the East this week.

According to Cap. Ray Popp the team is really up for the Navy
game. “We remember the Navy game from last season and it seems
the guys seem to have a lot of spirit.”

Two years ago Navy also beat the Panthers on a play which
didn’t gain Wayne Hardin any friends among the Pitt coaching
staff. Stewart limped off the ﬁeld for the Midshipmen and then
walked back on before the play started and took off down the
side lines to catch a long touchdown pass. Some of the Pitt play-
ers and coaches who were at the game should remember that play
well and might want a little revenge.

The Panthers are weak at end and not at full strength at tackle
and halfback. Navy won’t have their ﬁrst string fullback. Donnelly
and Staubach will be at less than full strength. Considering the in-
juries the game should be very even and how well either quarterback
plays could determine the outcome.

The freshman basketball team
has it largest number of candi-

Coach Carl Peterson. Thirty-ﬁve
freshmen are ﬁghting for 15
places on the squad. “Those boys
who obviously are not college

today,” Peterson said.

Next Friday's cut poses a much
more diﬁicult problem for the
coaches, Peterson said, because
many of the prospects have vir-

with basic strength, size and bas-

Booters Face Tough
Grove City Offense

by BILL CABIN
GROVE CITY, Pa.—The soccer team matches its well-
balanced offense against the powerful scoring attack of
Grove City, here today at 3 :30 p.m.

“Teamwise, we’ve been able to
score the goals when they were
needed,” said coach Leo Bemis.
“Although our offense is well-
distributed among our lineman,
we still lack a big scorer. There
should be a couple of players
scoring more.”

The highest average is one goal
per game held by All-America
left wing Dave Reichenbach. The
scoring totals at mid-season are

The booters have outscored their
opposition 18-8, while the Wol-

opponents.

“Our team has been maturing
with every game.” said Bemis,
“and the Howard game was our
best team effort this year, If we

Boeing's world leadership in the jet transport field is an indication of the
calibre of people you'd work with at Boeing. The forward-striding attitude re-

of pioneering achievements: first twin-engine, retractable-gear, low-wing,
all-metal airliner; first four-engine, pressurized airliner; first modern, high-
performance bomber; first large swept-wing, multi-jet bomber; and, of
course, America's first jetliner, the 707, and the 720 and three-jet 727.
(Right now we're designing a variable-sweep wing supersonic transport.)

Boeing is one of the nation's major manufacturers of heavy transport heli-

physics, nuclear and plasma physics, terrestrial and space ﬂight sciences

and allied human factors. ,

Engineers and scientists at Boeing work in small groups, under supervisors

picked for ability to inspire and promote the ideas of their associates.
Individual initiative and ability get plenty of exposure that way. (The com- _
pany encourages graduate studies at leading colleges and universities near
Boeing installations.) Boeing is an equal opportunity employer.

the line of scrimmage for long
losses, however, he always came
up with the big third down play.
He worked hook passes to Jim
Campbell for ﬁrst downs about
six times. Pat Domtelly also had
a ﬁne day for the Midshipmen
last year, although he may not
(be ready for the game tomorrow.

Although everyone, includ-

‘ing Navy publicity director

. Bud Thalman say Staubach will start, Athletic Director Frank

Carver was quoted as saying that Staubach may not start and that

: he may be held to limited duty by coach Wayne Hardin for the
Notre Dame game next week.

Staubach, like Mazurek, hasn’t been what everyone thought he
would be at the beginning of the season. He has an injury to his
_ achilles tendon, which he suffered in the Penn State game. He got
"j into the game against California last week and threw four inter-
V,-A ceptions.

1: such. 0
Starts for Navy ,

_ Mazurek on the other hand hasn’t been seriously injured but has
’ 9 had several minor injuries. He along with Staubach were supposed
to be dueling for the Heisman trophy, however, judging by perform-
ances so far this season neither Staubach or Mazurek has earned a
shot at that award.
