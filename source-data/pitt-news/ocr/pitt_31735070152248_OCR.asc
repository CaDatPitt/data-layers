Pitt students are breathing in pol-

‘ lution at concentrations morwelthariv

100 times greater than the accept-

’ able level, according to a recent

study by the Pitt Graduate School
of Public Health. -' .
The study, known as the Pitts-
burgh Regional Environmental
Threats Analysis, was released on-
line inAugust as the third in a series
of health assessments. The focus of
the study is a class of elements and

V compounds known as hazardous

air pollutants, or air toxics. These
pollutants come from a variety of
sources ranging from coal—ﬁred
power plants to diesel engines. Ac-

cording to the study, Pittsburghers

are twice as likely to get cancer from
these toxics as residents of neigh-
boring counties.‘ A _

The model for the study comes

from the U.S. Environmental Pro-' ’

tection Agency’s National—scale
Air Toxics Assessment,which sets
a one—in—a-million cancer risk as
the acceptable level. The average
national risk, according the EPA’s
2005 NATA release, is" much higher,
at 50 in a million. While the aver-
age risk in Allegheny County is 28

cancer cases per 1 million people, .

certain parts of Pittsburgh, includ-
ing Oakland, have levels in excess
of 100 per million.

Since 1997, Beta Theta Pi national
headquarters has worked to revive
its fraternity’s image through its
Men of Principle campaign. The
campaign strives to hold members
accountable for their behavior and
to cultivate intellect, responsible
conduct, mutual assistance, integ-

 

rity and trust.
Ten years ago, the headquar-
ters issued awarningto its Carnegie

Mellon chapter because of some '

members’ behavior.

The chapter responded by elect-
ing new leaders who tried to change
the cl1apter’s culture from parties

.and booze to academics and pro— .

fessionalism. Despite this, some
brothers still followed the old party

After suspension at CMU, ‘Men of Princip|e’found Pitt chapter

culture.
Last March, CMU shut down the
fraternity after police investigated

‘reportsof “alleged videos and pic— .

tures of a sexual nature” circulating
with members of the community,
the university said in a statement.
Now, this fraternity is coloniz-
ing at Pitt.
' V Beta Theta Pi is one of four fra-
ternities that will colonize at Pitt

within the next ﬁve years to allow
more men to get involved in fra-
ternity life. Interfraternity Council

- President Zach Patton and a board

of Greek and non- Greek students in
conjunction with the Office of Cross
Cultural and Leadership Develop-
ment devised the plan to expand
Pitt’s Greek community to include
these new organizations. The team
also decided which fraternities will

colonize on campus.

After the four fraternities be-
come established at Pitt, there
will be 23 chapters on campus.
According to Summer Rothrock,
assistant director of Leadership
Development and Greek Affairs
at Pitt, there are currently about
1,000 fraternity men at Pitt.

near Clairton Coke Works, tops the list.
Clairton Coke Works is a plant that converts
coal into “coke,” a ﬁiel for smelting iron. In
West Elizabeth, about 1,314 per 1 million
people would get cancer because of inhaling
air toxics, according to the Pitt researchers’
report.

U.S. Steel, the company that runs the .

Clairton Coke Works, was unavailable for
comment after multiple requests for com-
ment over several days.

Although the coke plant is oneof the larg-
est polluters in the region, according to the
study, the greatest cancer risk is diesel par-
ticulate matter. Many diesel engines used in
transportation, freight hauling, construction
and other sectors emit diesel exhaust, which
contains these toxic particles.

According tojamin Bogi, outreach coordi-
nator at the Pittsburgh-based Group Against

 

Smogand Po1lution,thisreportconﬁrms what
his organization has known for years.

.“We know diesel is a problem, we know
that the coke works is a problem,” Bogi said,
adding that his group, which a federal grant
primarily funds, works to reduce diesel emis-
sions and push companies to implement
cleaner processes. A

Bogi said his group put air monitors on

bicycles and rode around the city as part of '

an ongoing project. They found that the dif-
ference in pollution can vary greatly from
one street to the next. For example, he said
the air quality on Liblerty’Avenue, a busy thor-
oughfare between Oakland and East Liberty,
was often much worse than the air quality on
adjacent side streets.  °

Drew Michanowicz, adoctoral student at

A Pittwho worked on the assessment, said such

pockets of concentrated pollution are a result
of Pittsburgh’s complex topography, inwhich
low—lying valleys or busy corridors separated

History _

Besides suspending the chapter at CMU
indeﬁnitely, the national Beta Theta Pi ofﬁce
has closed about 85 chapters during the past
15 years.

Tristan Sopp, aBeta Theta Pi staff member
currently assisting the fraternity’s coloni-

zation at Pitt, said the national Beta Theta
Pi headquarters closed its chapter at Ohio
State University because of hazing and at the
University of Califomia-Berkeley because of
underage drinking and hazing.

Sopp said the national headquarters, lo-
cated in Oxford, Ohio, has been closing chap-
ters since it created its government structure
in the 1800s. Within the past two decades,
there has been a rise in closing chapters be-
cause of the standards of the Men of Principle

campaign.

Sopp said he does not see the closures as
an embarrassment to Beta Theta Pi’s head-
quarters.

“The closures, for us, are seen as a sign
of strength, because we hold our chapters
accountable,” he said. ,

Sopp said Beta Theta Pi’s headquarters
will never allow a university to close a chap-
ter, because the national organization would

. close it ﬁrst.

Although Beta Theta Pi chapters have had

that could have occurred. '

“The things that you will ﬁnd absent are
any signiﬁcant deaths,” Sopp said. “You will
never ﬁnd us backing men doing despicable

by buildings tend to trap emissions.

While diesel particulate matter remains a
problem, Michanowicz said it’s a mistake to
blame diesel-powered buses. ‘

“One bus effectively removes 60 cars off
the roadways,” Michanowicz said.

He added that he encourages people to
use public transportation.

]im’Ritchie, spokesman for the Allegheny
County Port Authority, said the authority has
reduced its bus ﬂeet particulate emissions by
96 percent since 1991. Aqccordingto Ritchie,
the Port Authoritypbegan to use a biodiesel .
blend in buses — a policy the state mandated
in 2010 — in 2009.

Public transportation use in‘ the United
States reduces carbon emissions by 37 million
metric tons annually, according to a report

_ the American Public Transportation Associa-

tion, a nonproﬁt based in Washington, D.C.,
released in 2008.

But Michanowicz said many of the dirti-
est diesel engines are not found on the road.
Rather, these are engines from barges, trains
and construction vehicles, as well as indus-

trial equipment such as compressors and

. conveyor belts.

“These are predominantly run on "die-
sel engines that don’t have the same kind of
regulations [as buses] yet,” Michanowicz said.

Michanowicz, his team at the Graduate
School of Public Health and the Breathe Proj-
ect, a local nonproﬁt coalition of individuals
and businessesthat aim to improve air quality
in Pittsburgh, have put together recommen-
dations for the city on how to reduce these
air—toxics levels.

These recommendations include the en-
forcement of Pittsburgh’s Clean Air Act of

 

December 6, 2018 I The Pitt’ News I vwvvv.pittnevve.c0m

2010, which requires publicly funded devel-
opment projects in Pittsburgh to reduce diesel
emissions from-their project construction
vehicles. The recommendations also include
the enforcement of air toxics guidelines for
companies applying for permits related to
hydraulic fracturing and the ensurement that
the Allegheny County Health Department’s
upcoming sulfur dioxide plan includes strong
control measures for coke ovens. A
Although air pollution poses ahealth risk,
Michanowicz he said the cancer risk from
air toxics was minor compared to the risk

from tobacco smoke, adding that a smoker
has a cancer risk of about 150,000 in a mil-
lion people.

In addition to health risks associated
with air toxics, there are also risks pertain-
ing to Pittsburgh’s future as a thriving post-
industrial city.

“If you look at Pittsburgh’s dramatic re-
vitalization, it is not based upon new steel
mills,” Bogi said, adding that diversiﬁcation
led to Pittsburgh’s economicaimprovement.

Bogi, who was raised in Greensburg but
lived for years in Seattle before moving to

3

Pittsburgh, said the city has many advantages,
including low cost of living and job growth. _

Bogi said it would be difficult to determine
how many people eliminated Pittsburgh as a
place to live orstart a business because of the
city’s poor air quality, but that the air quality
certainly isn’t attracting anyone.

“We need clean air for a strong economy
here,” Bogi said.

Michanowiciagreed.

“These environmental and infrastructural
challenges the city faces are high on my list,”
Michaowicz said. I

Educational s

tandards poorly measure

students’ potential for success

Sophia Al Rasheed
Columnist

Like many of my peers in the senior
class, I’m going through a stressful
grad school application process.
Testing anxiety made taking the

. LSAT a real treat, and my general

humbleness and borderline self-
loathing made bragging about
myself on applications even less
enjoyable. It’s safe to say that my
transition into the real world feels
anything but graceﬁil.

You can imagine my surprise,
then, when all these law schools ~—
top law schools — were emailing
me, expressing “sincere interest”

and observing my “potential for- .

great success,” along with a list of
established alumni who have gone
on to attain some fabulous titles.

I was obviously ﬂattered.’ But
after somgresearch‘ and realizing
that I have 5 zero percent chance
of getting into these schools based
on my numbers, I knew something
elsewas going on. I started to expe-
rience some other emotions, and
ﬁnally regressed to the self-doubt

that carried me through the applica-
tion process.

I originally viewed the tradition-
al system of ranking for graduate
school admissions — where grades
and test scores decide where you
stand on the imaginary scale — as
an anxiety—inducing, yet necessary,
process. There is no simple way to
establishacomparison between stu-
dents and, on the surface, it seems
perfectly fair to grant higher status
to those  the highest scores.
But after further research and time
spent establishing a spot on this
scale, I really questioned how valu-
able it is to place such importance
strictly on numbers.

The method used to rank and
parallel students to match the “ap-

propriate” school might be conve— ’

nient in terms of comparing a large
number of applicants, but it fails
to take into account the individual
strengths of an applicant.
Moreover, the high regard of the
institutions is inflated atthe expense
of those struggling for admission
underneath —— here’s where we get
to the real reason for all those fee

waivers. Aside from the personal
proof I have in mymailbox and the
fact that law schools will send out
warm and welcoming packages even
before LSAT scores are released,
multiple blog posts — like one from
Law School Expert— indicate that
the admissions staff, on certain oc-
casions, is more interested in main-
tainingahigh status and rankthan
the actual applicant.

Due to the decreasing amount
of law school applications this year
—— an average of a 20 percent. de-
cline since 2012 —— admission staifs
from top schools are increasingthe
amount of emails they send to stu-
dents who have avery little -— if any
— chance of being granted admis-
sion, even submitting fee waivers in
order to keep esteemed numbers.
This way, they accept the class size
they normally would despite the
staunch decrease.

Sounds like the admissions staff
listened to Ke$ha and decided to get
a bit sleazy. Students are not being
rewarded for the efforts they put

Al Rasheed D 5

into four years of undergrad, but are actually
being misdirected into discovering that they
don’t ﬁt into a standard, ideal category of
success. Whether this is a result of students
being judged or the result of a prestigious
application—to —acceptaIice ratio — such as the
University of Chicago’s 190-to-5,000 —- that
the institutions boast, it ﬁirthers the realiza-
tion that the numbers don’t match.

December 6, 2018 | The Pitt News | vvvvvv.pittrievvs.com

Standardsineducation mightbevaluable
as comparison tools for institutions, but these
head honchos teasing me with interest aren’t

realiziiighowdetrimentalthese standardscan '

be toward the applicants. It’s abit depressing
to think that no matter how much time may
have been placed into LSAT preparation, no
matter how much effort was placed on bal-
ancing a college career of school, volunteer
work, extracurricular activities and an intem—
ship, the ability to even be considered for top

' schools comes down to one’s LSAT score and

GPA. Notto mention hearing those ﬂattering

personal messages ﬁ‘om strangers who simply
want to add to their esteemed rejection list is
abit sad, aswell. '

I know that millennials have a few faults,
but it’s incredibly discouraging to see that
students who’ve exuded passion, drive and
direction throughout their educational career
might not be able to attend graduate programs
forthe simple fact that numbers do not match.
I’m ﬁilly aware that there are applicants who
have earned and should be rewarded for their
higher stance on the grading scale, but I’m
also very aware that many equally deserving

individuals are excluded from this.

Despite the fact that we worked incredibly
hard, followed the instructions of choosing a
major that we were passionate about as op-
posed to one that will manifest into a career
(myﬁrst advising appointment, verbatim) and
attempted to bring a well—rounded mindset
that could only manifest from incorporating
aspects other than strict studying‘ into our
college experience, we are still regarded as the
generation that didn’t live up to the measures

. carved out for us._l .

MEN’S BASKETBALL

Pitt aims to stay stingyvs. Loyola Marymount

Nate Barnes
Sports Editor

The Loyola Marymount Lions from _Los An-
geles, a team historically known for its fast
pace and high-scoring teams, average 79.8
points per game. That mark pales in com-
parison to when they scored more than 100
points per game in the late 1980s, but head
coach Jamie Dixon still has Pitt prepared
for Loyola Marymount’s up-tempo style.

“They press, obviously nothing close to
back in the day,” Dixon said. “I found an old
tape of a Loyola Marymount-UNLV game
that they played back there and actually
watched it this summer. It wasn’t the same
pace game, but they’re pressing.”

Pitt (8-0) enters the nonconference con-
test Friday coming off its toughest game of _
the season, a 78-69 victory Tuesday against

Penn State. Loyola Marymount (6-2) travels I

to Pittsburgh following their 73-69 triumph
at University of California-Riverside.

Anthony Ireland, a 5—foot-10-inch se-
nior guard, leads Loyola Marymount to
the Petersen Events Center as head coach
Max Good’s most dangerous weapon. Ire-
land averages 18.9 points per game and 5.1
assists per game, both team highs. Dixon
recognizes Ireland’s skill and ability to im-
pact the game.

“They’ve got a very good guard, a very
experienced guard,” Dixon said. -“A guy
who’s played a lot of minutes, had the ball
in his hands for a lot of time. He’s a decision-
maker, a playmaker and a scorer at the same
time, so we’ve got to keep him in [check] .”

The challenges presented by Ireland —-
whom Dixon referred to as, “Another guy
that wants to get to the free throw line’’ —
follow those offered by Penn State’s elite
guards, Tim Frazier and D.]. Newbill.

Frazier scored 27 points Tuesday, and
shot 7-of-8 from the free throw line. Newbill
added 17 points and went 6-for-8 at the
charity stripe.

The two players accounted for nearly a
third of Penn State’s 69 points, and Dixon
wants to see improvement in the way Pitt

- guards the opposition’s best scorer.

“We’ve got to do a betterjob,” Dixon said.
“They’re similar size-wise, quickness—wise.

_Frazier was a guy that wanted to go right.

This guy wants to go left.”

Frazier’s scoring performance was the
highest Pitt has allowed to any opposing
player so far this season. Beyond that, Pitt’s
starting duo of Cameronwright andjames
Robinson has been successful at defending
the perimeter, and Dixon said Pitt’s defense
“has been pretty good.”

“Obviously, we’ve shut some guys down,
kept them well below their averages early
on, but the last game, obviously Frazier got
some, and he got a lot at the end too, as we

know when we had that 10-point lead,”
he said.

Wright and Robinson will draw the task
of defending Ireland throughout the game,
and Dixon is conﬁdent that the Panthers
can, at the least, limit Ireland’s effectiveness
off the bounce. ‘

“We should not have trouble guard-
ing the dribble,” Dixon said. “It’s always
hard to guard the dribble, but we’re better
equipped than in recent years in guarding
the dribble.”

Mark Powell
Sta‘]j‘,', Writer

j V It may signal  beginning of ﬁnals week

to Pitt students, but this weekend also has
a full slate of games iniavariety of .sports.
The Panthers wrestling, track and ﬁeld
and gymnastics teams begin competitive
play, while the women’s basketball team
and the swimming and diving teams face

"tests away from Pittsburgh.

Wrestling .

Pitt wrestling looks to continue its re-
cent success as the Panthers enter their
inaugural ACC_ season against Maryland on
Friday before traveling to State College, Pa.,
to take on Penn State Sunday. The Panthers

' are coming off two‘ wins against Lehigh and

Lock Haven. .
The" Panthers will have to raise their

l ‘level of play as they enter one of the top

wrestling conferences in the country. Still,
Pitt expects to ﬁnish near the top of the
conference after making it to the NCAA
wrestling championships last season.

Tyler Wilps looks to build on his All-
American season in 2012, and is off to an
impressive start after taking home an in-
dividual title at the Keystone Classic last
week at the University of Pennsylvania in
Philadelphia. Shelton Mack also took home
an individual title in his weight class. Pitt
ﬁnished in fourth place as a team with 95
points.

Track and Field 7

Pitt men’s and women’s track and ﬁeld
teams will begin their seasons Friday at the

Golden Flash Gala in Kent, Ohio. This will '

improve on their individual accomplish-_

merits in the scrimmage. Koloski won
the 300-meter race, the long jump and
the triple jump. Whittington claimed the
5o0—meter dash. A

On the men’s side, seniors Brycen
Spratling and Carvin Nkanata expect to
lead the Panthers to a successful ﬁrst
season in the ACC. Spratling ﬁnished last
season as a Second Team All-American,
while Nkanata made the First Team.

Women’s Basketball

The Panthers will travel to Staten Is-
land, N .Y., to take on Wagner this Saturday
at noon.’ Pitt has had a mediocre start to
the season, going 4-3 intheir ﬁrst seven
games.

Pitt is coming off a disappointing home
loss to Buffalo Sunday, a game in which

they went in as the favorites. Despite a
valiant second-half effort, the Panthers
could not overcome a 16-point ﬁrst—half
deﬁcit. Junior guard Brianna Kiesel led
the way for_the Panthers with a game—high

. 17 points.

Pitt will look to continue their success
on the road this season, as they are 2-1 in
three games. The Panthers’ only loss was
at University of Michigan in Ann Arbor,
Mich. '

After this game, the Panthers have one
home game against Old Dominion before
traveling to Las Vegas for the Duel in the
Desert tournament.

Women’s Gymnastics

The Panthers will take part in their an-
nual Blue—Gold Exhibition’ this Saturday
at Kent State. Pitt is coming off one of the
most successful seasons in the history of
the program.

Panthers’ freshmen, especially one player in
particular who could see more time in future
games — starting against Loyola Marymount.

playing solid basketball, and hewas good. He
was steady.Josh is one of the fastest guys, and
we’ve spent a lot of time slowing him down.
And he was the guy that slowed us down on
