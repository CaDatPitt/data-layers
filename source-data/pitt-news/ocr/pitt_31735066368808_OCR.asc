Pitt Enters New School Year; State Ai ssre 2

By TOM KUKUCKA

Pitt News Staff Writer

Pitt opens the 1978-79 school year 2

without the threat of state
appropriations delays that last year
had University ofﬁcials borrowing

-as much as $2.500 a day to

compensate for the lack of ‘funds.
~With the signing of the state
budget by legislators and Gov.
Shapp last June, Pitt ofﬁcials can
breathe easier as a result of $63.1
million in aid granted to Pitt—a 4
percent increase and the ﬁrst
increase in more than three years.
The quick passage of this year's
state budget came with many
legislators up for reelection this
November. _ Members of the
University community will most
likely follow the November, elec-
tions closely, with two Western
Pennsylvanians, former Pittsburgh

. Mayor Peter Flaherty and former

‘United States attorney Richard
Thornburg, vyingfor the ofﬁce of
Governor.

The assurance oi’ state aid did
not. stop a tuition hike last May,
however, as students found a $25
increase tacked on to their invoice
this summer.- The May meeting of
Pitt’s Board of Trustees upped
tuition to $730 a term (the ﬁgure
was $605 _last year). Despite
objections from board members
Alfred Lawson and State Senator

, W. Lewis Coppersmith, the tuition
raise was passed «overwhelmingly-

‘fThis is - totally unacceptable, ”
Lawson said at the time. “I see Pitt

becoming a second-rate instution
because of a lack of funds and
because of an inability to attract a
quality student body.” '
Jack’ Freeman,‘ vice chancellor
for business and/planning, argued
that a tuition hike was needed to
prevent a deﬁcit position. __
“This is an austere budget,”
Freeman ‘said, “it is tenuously

balanced given the tuition in-

crease.” - T
“That decision (not to increase
tuition) would place us-inevitably-

-in a deﬁcit situation,” he added.

The trustees also passed a
revised tenure policy guideline and
faculty appeals procedures at the
May meet. These documents had
been changed’ to eliminate in-
adequacies “in tenure procedures
and appeal policies that became
apparent last year during the Paul
Nyden, Sharon Johnson and Yusef
Ali appointment controversies.

Instructors may now be appoint-
ed for three years instead of only
one; associate professors can be
appointed without being tenured,
and the title of associate professor
or professormay be bestowed on
special faculty members outside
the tenure stream who are hired on

- a temporary basis.

‘ The new tenure policy increased
the probationary period -for assoc-
iate professors or professors to
three-to-four years, and makes

part-time faculty working at Pitt at 

least a half-time eligible tenure‘.-

“We are trying to coming big

programs with a constant series of /

events so there is always some-
thing going on,” f said program-
ming chairman Tammy Haddad.
To reach this goal,’ the council
has scheduled various events
almost every day of the week

_ during the fall. .

Smaller events on the program
ming schedule include the movies
“Annie Hall,” “Silent Movie,”
“Young Frankenstein,” ' “Julia,”
“The Turning Point,” “Smokey
and the Bandit” and “Rocky.”

In addition,
horror shows and foreign ﬁlms will
be featured every Wednesday
night. The programming council
also plans to sponsor the National
Shakespeare Company’s produc-
tion of “Hamlet” Oct. 9. ‘

During the ﬁrst two weeks of the
term, the council will present live

vmusic “every day featuring local

talent such as the Shadyside, Jazz
Quintet, selling taffy apples and
other snacks. A Day in the Park on
Saturday, Sept. 17, .featuring the
Flying Burrito Brothers, Jonathan
Edwards, Louisiana, Leroux and
local musicians will be sponsored
jointly by the programming council
and Carnegie-Mellon University.

To insure that all students are
aware of programming during its
first year in existance, the council
_is planning a‘ massive public-
relations campaign throughout the
term. i .

Promotional activites will include
an open house for all interested
people in the Student a Union
~Ballroo'm'.:.Thursday, large bulletin

 

special -all-night_

and special programming commit-
tee stickers listing a special-act-
ivities hotline number.

Part .of the council’s attempt to
gain high visibility is its acquisition
of the Litchﬁeld Study Room for
new offices. Operation costs for
the ofﬁces in- Litchﬁeld, which was
formerly a student study lounge,
are expected to be $28,000 a year»

“We really need .it,” Haddad
said aboutthe new ofﬁce. \

“Otherwise people won’t check
to see what is happening.“
Student Union Manager Terry
Milani echoed the opinion that ‘the
council needed new office space._

_“We ‘hope the efforts of the
PUPC would outweigh the beneﬁts
of study area, especially since the
library, Cathedral and lower lounge
are readily available nearbyi and
have study areas,” Milani said.

The cost of the council’s fall

' programming is $50,000, one third .

of its $150,000 annual budget that

' was granted jointly by the Student

Government Board and the Office
of Student Activities last spring.-

‘ Haddad wants to receive feedback

to discover whether students are
happy with the way the council is
spending money provided by
students through the student
activites fee.

“We are planing a survey to ﬁnd

said. ‘-‘We also encourage people to

‘Double-Steal’ at Student Accounts

By RODNEY B. GRIFFITH
Pitt News Staff Writer

Two robbers, one armed with a
.38 caliber chrome-plated revolver,
netted approximately $5,700 in two
separate midday holdups of the
Office of Student Accounts in the
Cathedral. The robberies occurred
on two consecutive Fridays, August
25 and September 1.

Police reports of the ﬁrst robbery

state that two bandits waited
patiently in line at the check-cash-
ing window for ﬁve minutes while
the cashier waited on other
customers. The first suspect them
approached the window with the
pistol and demanded “all the
money. ” Cashier Lorraine McCabe
gave the robber the cash in her
drawer, approximately $3,500.
‘The same man approached the
same window during the second
robbery, police say, and handed
McCabe a white paper bag. .
“I’m back,” said the robber.
“Fill it up again, and this time I
want that 2 o’clock drop.”
McCabe said she told the man she
could only give him the money in
her drawer . The robber took the
ﬁlled bag and left, thanking the
cashier before he ﬂed, according to
the reports. ' I . -
Descriptions of the two suspects
by various witnesses differ.
McCabe described the gun-weild-
ing bandit in the ﬁrst robbery as a
white male, approximately 25 years
old, five feet six inches tall, 155
pounds with curly brown hair..
She described his accomplice as
a 25-year-old white male, ﬁve feet

‘To Russia . . . With Love?’ 4

.g‘ _..

Expected and Unusual Mark Pro

By NANCY WINTNER

Pitt News Staff Writer

Screaming, ﬁghting and physical -

abuse set the scene. People were
pushed and shoved, while others
were kicked and tripped. Pitt
Professor K. Jeffrey Johnson
couldn’t believe it. A bridal party
of approximately 25 to 30 people
were having a brawl in front of a
prominent tourist hotel in Moscow!

“It was unbelievable and not

I . typical of Russian behavior,” said.
Johnson, associate professor in

Pitt’s chemistry department who
spent 16 days «in the Soviet Union
this summer. “The bride was
kicked by other women in the bridal
party. The funny thing was that
there guards on every ﬂoor of the
hotel and in front of the place too.
And this must have gone on for at
least 10 minutes before it was
broken up.” >-

But this wasn’t the only unusual
“Bash” Johnson witnessed while
visiting Russia. Another took place
in an airport cafe—only this one
included caviar, champagne and
sweets for a party of eight who
clearly were. living it up in the
middle of the day. ’

“You don’t normally associate"

this with their lifestyle,” laughed
Johnson, 4 who visited Russia to
‘deliver a paper at the Fourth
International Conference on Com-
puters in Chemistry Research and
Education in Novosibirsk, Siberia.
“Russians are very hardworking
people and basically very. drab, but I
guess even the Russians have to let
it all hang out once in a while.”
Not “untypical of Russia,” was
the fact ‘that all of Johnson's
incoming mail from the United
States ' was opened before he

PUBLIC Norton T0 STUDENTS
Section 438 or the General
Education Provision Act, as amen-

ded ‘by’ Section 513 of Public Law’

93-380 and Section 2 of Public Law
93-568, referred to as the “Privacy
Rights of Parents and Students,”
(more commonly called the
“Buckley Amendment”) - requires
that Pitt give public notice to
parents , and students of the
following information.

The Buckley Amendment is
designed to protect, the privacy of

students. In order to do so, these

provisions are binding on the
University:

—Individual student records
should include only information
necessary and relevant to ‘the
educational purposes of the institu-
tion. —

—Student' records are open for
inspection by students or their
parents upon request, with the
exception that lettersﬂof recom-
mendation written prior to Jan. 1,
1975, remain conﬁdential. Addi-
tionally, speciﬁc documents that
students have waived their right to
inspect remain conﬁdential.

—-Students have a right to
challenge the accuracy of. records.

——The institution may not release
student records outside the institu-
tion without student consent, unless
one of several exceptions applies.

—Requests external to the
institution for information regard-
ing students should be documen-
ted, as should releases of student
information.

—The University may establish
categories'of information known as
“Directory Information” and re-
leasethis information upon request
by individuals external “to the

after students are provided the.

received it. “Maybe the glue came
unstuck ,or maybe it was CIA
America, but I got three pieces of
mail, all of which were opened.”

It wasn’t unusual either that
Johnson was thoroughly checked
when he went through customs in
Russia. It was strange that he had
to relinquish an encyclopedia-like
book,“‘The Russians,” written by
Pulitzer Prize winner, Hedrick
Smith, chief Moscow correspondent
for The New York Times.

“They called the book porno-
graphic,” Johnson said. “And yet
it is a book everyone should read.
The Russians are very nationalistic
Anything that may be
against Mother Russia is consider-
ed salacious.” _

After ﬁlling out certain forms,
Johnson was able to take the book
with him when he returned to
America.

Intrigued with the Russian
lifestyle as ‘many westerners _are,
Johnson was particularly fascinated
with the country's metro system,
Russia’s primary source of trans-
portation, which strongly contrasts
with New York City's subway
stations.

“Russia’s metro systems were
simply works of art,” the professor
added. “They were mozaic and
marble and all the unique lighting
was via chandeliers. There was not
a single piece of grafﬁti. The places
were extremely clean.”

Johnson was particularly over-
whelmed by the wall-to-wall
peasants that often waited hours or

V days in the stations just to get a

room on a particular train.

“I remember one scene where
people were lying on the floor,” he
said. ‘ ‘A cleaning lady came by and

got them to stand up. But as soon as
she was done mopping the ﬂoors,
the peasants sat right back down.”

Johnson said he couldn't get over
“this massive number of people,
everyone of which" looked so
destitute. “The men wore brown,
gray or black suits that were not
pressed and the women wore what
looked like black potato sacks,”
Johnson said, noting that Russia’s
poverty situation is much worse
than the United Stated." “There
were .very few suitcases. Most
carried their belongings in string
bagsf’

What about Russia’s colleges and
dormitory life? It might seem hard

to believe, but students there do not .

pay tuition, Johnson noted.

“The students there get paid to
go to college. It's almost like a
fellowship,” he said. “But it’s not
quite enough to meet all their
expenses. The Russians don’t have
the idea that we have about going on

to higher education. Only a small .

percentage actually go to college.”
I As for their curriculum and
examination system, students
mainly take required courses like
political economics—particularly

- Marxism—and only have exams

once a year.
“That includes written and oral
test,” Johnson said “The students

either pass of fail. If they fail, they
have one chance to take it over and.
.. you can imagine this exam period as

being one of enormous anxiety.”

I Russia, like the United States, K,

has its own brand of students.

“One student there offered" me
three rubles for one dollar—one
ruble being equal to 1.3 dollars,”
Johnson said. “It was 3-to-1 in my
favor. Anoth_er student offered me

 

\

150 dollars for the jeans I was
‘wearing. The blackmarket_ price
was 400 dollars.” -
Although Johnson confronted a
few problems while touring Russia,
he said “it was a real experience
worth doing only once in a

, Sadat, Begin

By The Associated Press

CAMP DAVID, Md.—President
Carter concentrated on key issues in
the Arab-Israeli conﬂict yesterday at
his secrecy-shrouded Mideast sum-
mit with Israel’s Menachem Begin
and Egypt’s Anwar Sadat. A

Carter’s negotiating strategy was
,to move swiftly to the heart of the
30-year-old dispute rather than take
the easier course of beginning with
peripheral and less controversial
items.

An Egyptian official, asking not
to be identified, said Carter, Prime
Minister Begin and President Sadat
were discussing the central issues.
Carter is trying to persuade Sadat
and Begin to compromise dif-
ferences over borders, Jewish

a Palestinian homeland and peace
terms. I‘

There was no word‘ from the
Egyptians, the Israelis or the
Americans about whether Carter
was making progress.

Carter, Begin and Sadat met for a

three hours. At his daily brieﬁng as
the meeting was drawing to ‘a close,
Jody Powell, White House press
secretary and summit spokesman,

"touched on Carter’s determination

to work out meaningful com-
promises toward a settlement.

Powell said he would “certainly
not be surprised” if the discussion
dealt with such troublesome-- topics
as the Israe i-occupied West Bank
of the Jord n River and the Gaza
Strip.

It was the second three-way
meeting in two days. Powell said
Carter, Begin and Sadat would take
“breaks” over the weekend for
religious observances at Camp
.David—but “there will be no
overall break.” '

The spokesman declined to
describe the mood at the meeting.
“I don’t feel that is necessary at this
point, ’ ’ Powell said. ‘ ‘ . .‘-'.Not having
been there, I wouldn’t want to
characterize them with any term that
has reverberations.” \

Powell also refused to term the,
talks a resumption of direct
negotiations between Egypt and
Israel. The negotiations were

Srakocic photo

Continue Peace Talks

broken off last January in Jerusalem
at the ministerial level.

Egyptian sources said they
expected thetalks‘ to be extended
into next week, but Powell made no
predictions beyond the weekend.

Carter brought Begin and Sadat
together at 10:40 a.m. EDT. their
meeting in Aspen Lodge, the U.S.
president’s quarters, ended at 1:35
p.m.

Secretary of Defense Harold
Brown was summoned to Camp
David. Powell said it was because of
his “general role, and expertise in

' the area.’ ’ But Brown and other key

advisers did not participate in
Carter's meeting with ‘Begin and

Sadat. The three leaders were alone’

for their three-way session.

SGB Plan Seeks to 'CentraIize' Health Services

By SUE McFARLAND

Pitt News Staff Writer
A plan to centralize the services

"offered by the student-run Peer
.Medical Aid Program and the

University controlled Student
Health Center was recently drafted
by Student Government ‘Board’
member Dave Hesidence.

The medical aid program, which
offers medical counseling and
emergency first-aid treatment,
was, until last April a branch of the
now disbanded Student Govern-
ment Medical Action Committee.

’ “The Medical Action Committee
was dissolved last April because of
a lack of stafﬁng but also because
of the duplication of service
between their program and the
Student Health Service,” Hesi-
dence said.

The proposal calls for a medical
aid program that would be
ﬁnancially dependent on and ad-
ministered by the Student Health
Service and Student Health fees
while still “retaining its student-
run nature.”

According to Hesidence,‘ the
jointure would provide for close
monitoring of medical aid duties by

trained health professionals.

“The serv_ic_e‘s provided by
PMAP can-acreate -9 some touchy

' v:.}5it_uations that an undergraduate ’
A regardless ‘of their-=';traning,....might
not be able._ to 3 handle -_1well'_§.as 

someone trained in the ﬁeld,”
Hesidence said.

The plan also‘ calls for the
restructuring of the Student Health
Advisory Committee, the body that
oversees the operation of the
Student Health Service.

Under the SGB proposal, the
board and Graduate and Pro-
fessional Student Association
would each appoint three rep-
resentatives providing for a more
equal distribution of input from the
students using the health service:

In addition, one non-voting
representative of the School of
General Studies Cabinet would be
appointed. That member would
carry no vote because of the limited
involvement of SGS students with
health service.

Hesidence stressed that the
monitoring of the health service by
the Student Health Advisory
Committee would in no way be

affected by the changes or the‘

added duties of overseeing the
administration of the medical aid
program. ’

The plan would be twofold, one
that would strengthen the ties of the
medical aid program to the Student
Health Service and those of/Student

Government's to the health service,

Hesidence said.

Hesidence cited poor com-'

munication between members of
the involved parties over the

summer months as the reason for I
_ -the -proposal not being approved‘. ,
prior to the start of fall,term. He  A

did, however, express optimism
that the program change would be
approved when it goes before
representatives of these groups in.
the nearyfuturé.

“PMAP is a vital service that we
can’t afford to lose,” Hesidence
said. “We want to make it the type
of service that a student wouldn’t
hesitate going to with any kind of

health problem, and for this reason
we felt it was our obligation to
make an overall_ effort to centralize
the services that we have available
to us.”

Approximately 40 Pitt resident
students were temporaroly trans-
ferred to accomodations at the
Crossgates Inn while renovations
on two ﬂoors of the Bruce Hall
residence _continued' into the early
part of the week, according to
Housing Director Don Hughes.

Pitt students have been tempor-
arily transferred to -accomodations
at the. Crossgates Inn while
renovations at the Bruce Hall dorm
continue. Those renovations are
expected to be completed today,
according to Housing Director Don
Hughes. ‘ ’

The approximately 40 students
from the 10th and 11th ﬂoors of

Bruce Hall were slated to stay at

 

the Crossgates because of incom-
plete electrical wiring, ‘block work

and plastering. But work “speed-'

ed up” on the 10th ﬂoor during the
past week, according to Hughes, so
students who checked in over the
weekend were sent to Crossgates
for a two-day stay.

“The remaining students should
be moved into Bruce Hall on
Wednesday,” Hughes said. “The
draperies aren't hung yet and
won’t be until the end of the
week.” -

Construction is continuing at the
Forbes Pavillion residence- hall,
Hughes said, although the living
quarters have been completed.
The first and second floors of the
building, a commercial property
and a housekeeping-programming

Crossgates Provides Temporary   ’
Home for Bruce Hall Residents

area, respectively, are. not yet
ﬁnished. The Pavillion’s parking
garage will not be utilized for
students and will not be ready for
useuntil the commercial properties
on the building's first floor are
ﬁnished.

“The Housing Ofﬁce made a
conscious attempt not to place

students needing parkingat Forbes,

Pavillion,” Hughes said.

Hughes also said a limited
numberlof parking spaces (approx-
imately 15) will be available for
students at the rear of the building.

Since the spaces will be outdoors,
prices will be slightly less than in
the Towers garage.

Hughes said that landscaping on’
the, second-ﬂoor terrace is being
planned for Forbes Pavillion. ‘

Bowen Winsi Student ServicePo

By TOM KUKUCKAA
Pitt News Staff Writer

Alden E. Bowen, former director
of the University Student Judicial
System, has been appointed
director of the Office of Special
Student Services. ’

The office provides services at
Pitt to,-veterans, commuter, and
students with off-campus housing.
It also provides consumer inform-

ation and, under Bowen, will be .

affiliated with the University
Judicial System. -

Bowen, who took over as director
of student services when Jack
Hayes resigned last spring, said he
planned many changes but could
not elaborate until he became
“ settled in ”with the new position.

“I’m not sure what direction we
are going to move in, ” Bowen said
“We are going to
attempt to serve as a resource for

‘commuters, help coordinate the

ﬂow of the commuters into the
University. ”

_ <7 Pitt’s student Government
Board, with its commuter com- -

mittee, has in the past attempted to
invlolve commuters more in Univ-
ersity affairs, and Bowen saidhe
would be “actively involved -in.”
working with the SGB. ‘

Bowen said his biggest asset
to off-campus students would be

T’ his services as a lawyer.

’ ’There will now be two attorneys
available to students to advise
them of their rights,“ he said.

Charlene , Hunter, a recent
graduate of Pitt School of Law, will

replace Bowen as coordinator of the

Student Judicial System.

Bowen also expressed i interest
in helpingh beterans adjust to

campus life through “peer-
counseling.”
‘ “(College) faculty is geared

toward the 18-year-old,” Bowen
said. f‘We want to try to help the
veteran make that adustment. Just
the change of coming back into
society is difﬁcult enough.”

Left unanswered are the difficult ques-
tions and challenges posed by Dr. Marshall
(see “Pitt. and the Pendulum,” page nine).
How, he has asked, will the institution of
basic skills course requirements improve
students’ reading, writing and ciphering,
when almost all students already take those
skill courses without them being required?
How exactly would a more rigorous
distribution of studies requirement enhance
a liberal ‘arts education? And how in the
world can Pitt claim a commitment to

quality undergraduate education when the ‘
~ ‘tenure process . here is so obviously geared

toward rewarding those faculty activities
least beneficial to undergraduates?

It is this last area that should concern
students" most. Someone once noted that the
three least‘ credible sentences in the English
language are: C V

1. “The check isinthe mail.” .

2. “Of .' course, I’ll respect you in the
morning.” , .

3__. “I’m from the government and I’m here

' to help you.” ~ .

To these might be added a fourth: .

4.. “The administration is strongly suppor-
tive of excellence in teaching.’ ’

One need not look far to ﬁnd good eviden-
ce that the administration is not as committed
to quality teaching as it would have us believe.

Those on the faculty who spend their time

I student’s papers do not. (When is the last

time anyone here got a paper back from a
professor with extensive comments in the
margins?) In addition, teachingloads in the
various departments have been shown to
favor those disciplines that are most likely to
win prestige (and grant money) for the
Universitythrough their research activities.

"T Perhaps Dean Schulman’s most pressing
task will be to demonstrate how the-«new wave
of traditionalism, structure and more forceful
guidance will benefit the undergraduates
whose‘ interests he represents. He should be
given a reasonable chance to do so, and he
should be supported in what we are surewill
be his sincere commitment to improving the

S quality of education at Pitt. Most important,

Dean Schulrnan’s ideas and attitudes should
not be judged simply in light of his
predecessor’s beliefs. To do so would be a

disservice both to the man and to the

position he holds.

S The Ugly Amen'can’s Intrusions in Canada  

 By RODNEY B. GRIFFITH

Canadians maintain a subdued
dislike for their Southern. neighbor.

‘T It never erupts into the violent

ism” many third world countries .

“periodically voice, oi; into personal

-hatred directed at individual

--Americans, but the smoldering
Wgrudge against American corpora-

tions and their domination of

' "_'Canada’s economy persists.

One New Brunswick French-
Canadian student compares his
‘people's dislike for the English to

. the nebulous fear many Canadians
' have about the United States and its

corporations. “The French are a

‘_ small minority in Canada, and they

fear; being assimilated ‘and lost

within the English majority in the
same way English Canadians fear’

U.S.- inﬂuence.”

His analogy is apt, but the
assimilation Canadians as a whole
dread is much more subtle than the
threat to the culture and language of
the ﬁve million French-speaking
Canadian citizens._The assimilation
the majority fears is a total
absorption into the United States
economy through the control of
Canadian businesses.

Canadians’ fears that they might
becorrre totally dependent on
American corporations are well
justiﬁed. U.S. companies control 58

’ percent of Canada’s oil and natural

gas industry, 45- percent of its

manufacturing, 43 percent of its

mining and smelting and 36 percent .

of its pulp and paper production.
Canada also heavily depends on
imports, 85 percent of them fresh
from factories onthe other side of its
southern border. A quick trek
through any-Canadian grocery store
shows the prominence of American

businesses. Familiar brand name _

products such as Kraft cheese, Aunt
Jemima’s Maple Syrup and Max-
well House Coffee adorn the
shelves. The only difference is the
labels, which are written in both
French and English.

New York are the people who
manipulate the strings that help
determine Canada’s ﬁnancial well-
being. As a result," areas in Canada
such as Newfoundland, with 34
percent unemployment, sorely need
industry but remain underde-
.veloped because investment is too
risky.

Unable to command“ their own
economy, Canadians are further
humiliated by their exclusion from
top management positions in
American-controlled Canadian
companies. , High level appoint-
ments are routinely given only to
imported executives from the States
who help guarantee the companies
serve the owners’—and not neces-
sarily Canada’s—interests.

The Canadian government has
not watched idly as American
companies’ have expanded their

‘ inﬂuence.‘ The Foreign Investment

Review Act was passed to restrict
new and expanding operations by

‘multinational corporations, which

means mostly American firms.
Trudeau’s government has also
tried to establish economic ties with
other nations besides the U.S.-
especially Japan—to diminish the
economic domination by American
corporate giants. .,

These steps by Trudeau still only
represent a very mild attempt to
restrict operations, by multina-
tionals‘ in Canada. Canadian
politicians are too timid to_take any
more radical action to stop or
reverse the inﬂuence of multina-
tionals in their country, because any
other steps could easily turn into a

‘ﬁasco for Canadian politicians. If

they attempted stronger control,
American companies could com-
pletely withdraw their investments
and send Canada’s economy into

1 <  ‘f'

spasms. Multinationals never fail to
threaten foreign governments with
this fact whenever any controls are
planned. ' ’

American companies could im-
prove their poor relations with

Canadians if they would reform,

their companies to allow Canadians
in upper echelon management, and
if they would consider the effects of
their business activities ' before
acting.- Unfortunately, the proﬁt
margin matters more to most
corporations than good —»relations
with foreign governments, and they
are slow to change their business
practices. A ’

It's the old’ story of the “ugly
American,” too ethnocentric to
recognize the culture he invades. In
the case of Canada, the problem is
compounded because many Ameri-_
cans operate under the assumption
that since Canadians are English
and _ live in North America, they
must be the same as Americans.

‘ A waitress in a diner in a small
southeastern New York town shows
the typical ignorance about Canada.

When shefwas shown Canadian .

currency, she asked, “Is that the
money that the French use?” She
was surprised to hear that all
Canadians, both English ‘and
French, use money different from
our own. v

If American corporations are to
work peacefully in Canada, they
must overcome this ignorance about
Canada, and realize it is a separate
country with an independent
culture and history they must
respect. Unless they do this,
corporations may someday find
themselves nationalized and crying

Opinion

Pitt and

the Pendulum

By ROBERT MARSHALL

My tenure as Dean of the College

A of Arts and Sciences has drawn to a
close, but I would like to make _

again some favorite poin-t.s-—favor-
ites of mine, that -is.’ ~  - , .

II‘ have heard-myself described as
a -one-issue dean_7_. . (the famous
teaching-research dichotomy), and
I couldn’t agreelmore. .There is
only one issue in our town, and that
is the way in which faculty deﬁne
their wor_k and make
commitments. Faculty do indeed

-experience dichotomizing conflicts

in their professional lives—..-
between their “own work” (a very
familiar- phrase, wouldn’t you
agree?) -. and the work of this

‘community. .

. I’v,e"'used the familiar rubrics of
the university in deﬁning the
former as “research,” by which I
have-always meant the ‘faculty's

identification with their own"

professional interests through their
national disciplines, and the latter
as “teaching,” by which I’ve
always meant thegcommitment of
the faculty’s energy and focus and’

will to the needs of our local.

community. The . latter mainly
means, of course, to the least of the
“brethren-” of our community, the
undergraduates or rather the
freshmen-sophomores or rather the
less talented freshmen-sopho--
mores.’ A

‘Frankly, I ﬁnd it infuriating for
people to claim that this conﬂict
does not exist in faculty lives, that
teaching and research are beauti-
fully and subtly complementary. It
simply isn’t true. One has only to
read faculty dossiers and attend
tenure review hearings for ﬁve
years to see that.

There’s a real contest between
those two pulls of academic life,
and it’s an unfair one. The glitter
of national recognition is rather
tempting compared to the grueling
job of working slowly and carefully
with the development of the
abilities and skills and awarenesses
of our students.

Astronauts—once a favorite—are
no longer‘ in the news. Athletes
have inﬂated themselves to the
extent that they are now often more
gaseous than great. Politicians are
in utter disrepute. Professors and
other ostensibly learned persons
never did count for much in
muscular, non—theoretical America.

The_ climate of this decade in
particular has not been favorable to
the cultivation of heroes. Eventhe
anti-authoritarian Sixties had its
icons—as diverse as ' Neil
Armstrong and Che Guevara—but
cynicism, it seems, has allied with

self-interest to form the ethos of the ~

Seventies. It is not without some

_ surprise, then, that I have recently

-realized that I have a hero.

His name is George -Frederick
Will, and he is, of all things
unheroic, a pundit. As a columnist
for The Washington Post and
Newsweek, he was the 1977 Pulitzer
Prize winner for commentary. .

Will is, for -me at least, an unlikely

hero. He likes Woody Hayes. Good 

their ,

Those faculty members who have
most vociferously argued against
the existence of this dichotomy
should try teaching three courses
a term the way many of their
colleagues do; .they should try
giving up their TA’s; try assigning
and reading several hundred

papers and essay exams a term; jtry__ A
ﬁlling the margins of those papers-"§..4.'f.1.
with comments; try getting out 

from behind the podium and really
working through the discussion
method with the speaking and
reasoning abilities of -their stu-
dents; try individualizing their
instruction, ‘among other ways by
spending hours and hours with
students outside of the classroom;
they should try giving their
students evaluative feedback after

’ the most important stage of the

term, , the ‘ﬁnal exam’. Then they
can_~come back and tell me they
Vdonft experience a conﬂict between
teaching and research. (If you’ve
been an assistant professor doing
these things, you won't get a
chance to come back tome; you will
have been ﬁred.)

I’m talking about the difference
between professing and teaching.
Those of ‘us on the faculty have all
been trained as professors; conse-
quently we're most comfortable at
initiating disciples into our discip-
lines. By deﬁnition, disciples don’t
need teaching or converting; they
need only preaching or professing.

I used to be a professor. When
the first surges of the late 60's
came, I remember resisting and
explaining to those who ridiculed
me that I had earlier decided, after
a year’s experience, that I did not
want to be a high school teacher
but rather a college professor. I

recognized that the obligation of a '
' high school teacher was to care

about the development of every
individual in the classroom but that
the obligation of professor was to
c_are about his or her own
development,~the basic assumption
of our profession being that all
good will follow"i"nevitably froma
talented professoriate looking after
itself.

Finding aHero in the

taste prevents me from writing
anything about Woody Hayes.
Furthermore, Will roots for the
Chicago Cubs, which is absolute
anathema to anyone who, like me,
learned his sports loyalties in St.
Louis. Politically, he is a sort of
closet pragmatist who somehnow
speaks the language of principle,
even moral principle. He is a
conservative, and he admits it.

But his misguided athletic
allegiances and his partial lack of
philosophic acumen ‘notwithstand-
ing, George Will is undeniably
brilliant. A former teacher of
political theory at Michigan State
and the University of Toronto, he
brings to his writing an intellect of
-rare quality. Like a certain Irish
cleric of the early 18th century, Will
spices that intellect with wit as he
dutifully uncovers the not-so-l-atent
Yahooin -modern man. Perhaps
best of all,‘ his ﬂair for fast-paced,
absorbing prose belies his academic
past and gives him his station
among the most readable of

of contemporary columnists.

Will is at-his best when :he.is‘-
ilauding or lampoolning public _

 
   

I used to say to people. that my
job was to scatter seed, in the
classroom as broadly as possible
and that it was no concern of mine

if that seed fell on fertile ground or V

rocks or thorns. Iwasn’t, after all,
the one who admitted rocks and
thorns‘ to. the university. Eval-ua-
tion? Grading? ‘ Its only goal was to
sort out people at the end for
society’s uses, certainly not to
continue the process of learning.
I guess the turning point for me
was when I came to realize that I
didn’t have anything approaching
disciples out there in the class-
room: I then followed many of my
colleagues into the strenuous,’ time
and energy consuming world of
teaching—-only to be told after a
few years that there. is no
dichotomy between. the worlds of
teaching and research. More
lfortunatelythan many, I had tenure
before the message of the
returning pendulum gathered
force. V
(By the way, I have always
respected and valued the research
mission of the university. and
.argued consequently for the
principle of diversiﬁed stafﬁng. We
ought to understand the differ-
ences among disciplines, among
departmental traditions and among

the strengths of " individu'al's,‘ and

we ought to I build from that
understanding, a sophisticated

raculty development system de-
signed to reﬂect the complexity of
our needs and missions. Our goal,_
if we really mean the glib term
“faculty development,” ought to
be to make it possible for all faculty

to "succeed in creatively=diversify- .

ing ways.) a
In my last days as dean, as I

reviewed in my own mind ‘the

concerns Ihad focused on and tried
to evaluate what happened, I was
especially aware of the dominance
of this “one issue.” When I
became dean, it was on the heels of
radical changes in the curriculum
and the faculty rewards system. I
assumedthat I had beensappointed
dean because I had participated so
fully in those changes and that my
charge was to fulﬁll the promise of
those times and beliefs.

At ﬁrst, I was jealous of my
predecessor because it seemed that
all the changes had already been
But I came to
realize that the greater challenge
existed, that the changes had,taken
place on paper, duly voted on by
the faculty, but not necessarily in
the hearts of the faculty.

We had instituted a freer
structure (which is not to say a_ lack
of structure) and we had, so to
speak, put our faith in the power of
people. Students and faculty alike
were going to invigorate our
institution with a fresh sense of

Cynical Seventies .

Like a certain, Irish
cleric of the 18th Cen-
tury, Will spices his in-

ﬁgures and popular culture. Last
summer he noticed that the
Pittsburgh Pirates in their new
black, and yellow uniforms looked
rather like the softball team from
Ralph’s Bar & Grill; More recently
he traced the evolution of the
necktie from Croatian mercenaries
to the present, ending his historical
lesson with a dig at the fashion
industry and a" plug for his personal
favorite, the conservative bowknot.

According to Will, Hugh Hef-
ner’s life and philosophy _are
strikingly reminiscent of a fictional
lost soul of another generation, Jay
Gatsby by name. Calvin Coolidge is

.too much maligned, he says, for a
"man whose, presidency coincided
= with “a 45 percent increase in the

production of ice cream.” Of’ Jean

..Paul Sartre and the foibles ‘of

existentialism, Will says:
“Existentialism often seems to

‘be the belief that because life is

absurd, philosophy should be, too.

Sartre is the patron saint of those
people in black turtlenecks and
black moods who used to frequent
the Boulevard St. Germain, com-

paring notes on the emptiness of-

life. Sartre himself looks like a man
who received some bad news, in
1947 and hasn’t gotten over it.”

Stepping into the realm of
political philosophy, Will is some-
what more likely to trip overhis
ideology. Dismissing the motive-
consciousness of Simone Weil, he
says, “Policies have complex
consequences, and consequences
are more important than motives. ’ ’ b
He doesn’t seem to notice the
impossibility of divorcing conse-
quences from the motives that
engender them: so I'm led to
believe that he is_ at least a little
stuck in the pseudo-moral pragmat-
ism that is_ the heritage of modern
American conservatism.

Pitt News Staff Writer

Officials at WPGH radio, Pitt's

~ student-run station, have appar-

ently corrected the technical
problems that forced a station
shutdown last March and have set
Sept. 13 as the tentative date for
beginning campus-wide broadcast.

WPGH~--broadcasts by way of
carrier current, a system from
which the station’s AM signal is
transmitted from the Student Union
to the Towers and the Quad through
an electrical current. Damages to
the system discovered last spring
showed that “leaks” had occurred,

causing limited open-air broadcast. ~ '

Under FCC regulations, ‘WPGH
is not permitted to broadcast open
air. .

“We are working on repairing
equipment we have now,” program

- director Dan Shalenko said yester-

day. “We will be able to be heard

on the majority of the campus even .

though the carrier current system in
not 100 percent.”

WPGH also is currently “work-
ing on various aspects of open-air
operations,” according to general
manager Jeff Couch. An open-air
research committee, consisting of
Couch, Shalenko and Student
Government Board members David

Hesidence and Stan Galanski has
been formed to reach that goal.

A consultant, FM Educational
Associates from Boston, has been
hired to search for an FM frequency
band, according to Couch.

“There are frequencies open on
the education FM band (88-92
megahurtz), ’ ’ Shalenko said. ‘ ‘We
are working on various ways of
presenting this ‘ idea to the
University.” A

A request for a permit to build an
FM station has been submitted to
the FCC,_ according to Shalenko,
and “in four-to-six months we will
hear from the FCC.”

“If the permit is granted, we will.

have one year to construct the
station,” Shalenko said.

He added that he believes there is
a 50-50 chance the construction
permit will be approved.

”Once granted, the permit is not
binding,” he said. “It only grants
us the right to build.the station.”

Couch suggested if the process

proceeds smoothly, WPGH could be _
an open-air facility by the fall of,

1980.
‘ Requirements that WPGH would
have to ﬁll by that time include a

first-class engineer who would be

available to the station 24 hours a
‘day, and all disc-jockeys would be

IWPGH Set to Resume Broadcast

required to obtain third-class air
licenses.

Although attempts in the mid70’s
to achieve open-air licenses were
attempted, Couch believes “this is
the most in-depth research done-—
more organization.” It would
create a 1,000-watt station capable
of broadcast within a 20-mile
radius. _

Proper funding is the key,

Shalenko said, and “there -are
literally hundreds of ways funding
from the University could be set
up‘)! '
Although informal meetings have
been conducted with director of
student activities Willard “Bud”
Heaps, funding was not discussed
and no monetary ﬁgures were
suggested.

“Basically, we discussed differ-
ent strategies to legitimize an
open-air station at Pitt, ” Hesidence
said. “There were an infinite
amount of proposals.

“I think the administration is
ready for an open-air station,”
Hesidence added, “‘They (Pitt
officials) see it as a possible means
of recruitment and a potential boost
to community relations.”

Hesidence said, however, that
talks at, this pointare only at the
basic. level.

Carter Wins Veto Confrontation

By The Associated Dress

WASHINGTON—President
Carter won a surprisingly strong
victory in his ﬁrst veto confrontation
with Congress as the House
yesterday upheld his rejection of the
Defense Authorization Act and its
$2 billionnuclear aircraft carrier.

Despite an intensive bipartisan
campaign mounted by the armed
services committees in both House
and Senate to override the Aug. 17
veto, Carter was sustained with
power to spare. _

The vote to override failed
191-206, or 74 votes short of the
necessary two-thirds. Leaders on
both sides of the issue had
predicted a much closer outcome.

The overall $37 billion measure
vetoed by the president was sent
back to committee, where the
carrier, decried by Carter as
wasteful, will be deleted and other
projects may be added at .his
behest.

In a statement issued at the
White House while he was at Camp
David for the Middle East summit,
Carter said he was very pleased
with the outcome and eager to work
“closely and cooperatively with the
Congress in enacting a new bill that
will provide the strongest possible
national defense.”

K,

Though he had vetoed four other
bills earlier in his presidency, none
drew an attempt to override. But
his decision on the authorization
bill, the ﬁrst veto of a major
defense measure in modern his-
tory, angered Sen. John Stennis,
D-Miss.,. and Rep. Melvin Price,

/D-Ill., the armed services chair-

men, and drew charges that the
chief executive was usurping their
constitutional duty. , '

A "disappointed Stennis moved
immediately after the‘ House vote
to re-introduce the same bill, minus
the carrier“, “A new start must be
made and time is of the essence,”
he said. , 0

However, Carter‘ hopes that
rather than simply cutting out the
carrier, the Congress ‘will add
several new programs, including
$200 million for research and
development. Most of his
proposals would bolster the Army
and Air Force. - 

The authorization applies to the
ﬁscal year beginning Oct. 1, and it
appeared that any major changes to
the overall bill might delay its
passage far beyond that date. If

,that happened, Congress likely

would pass a resolution funding
existing prograrrismbut delaying
those. that are new in the bill.

Proponents of an override had
optimistically pointed to the fact
that the House originally passed
the bill 319-67 and the Senate did
so by an 87-2 margin. But those
numbers could not hold up in the
face of the majority leadership’s
campaign on the president's
behalf.

The $2 billion carrier was charted"

as the Navy’s ﬁfth, and would have
replaced the old Midway in about
eight years.

Carter says he will ask for a
conventional carrier in his ﬁscal
1980 budget, at a savings of about
$1 billion. 4 .

High Gold Prices Mean Danger,
Low Pay for African Miners

By The Associated Press

CARLETONVILLE, South Af-
rica-——While ‘ telephones jingle in
London, Zurich and Chicago and
speculators push gold to record
prices, black miners crawl through
waist-high‘ tunnels to _wrench the
metal from the world’s deepest
Their sweat-soaked bodies
give some hint of why the metal is
so precious.

The miners’ day begins in a steel
cage hurtling downward at nearly
40 miles per hour past layers of
time imbedded in rock. V

It is almost an hour of
stop-and-go before they reach the
bottom, where they crawl through a
maze of tunnels little more than a
yard high to take their turns with
jackhammers against the solid
rock. The temperature of the rock
is 135 degrees. -The dust-ﬁlled air
is refrigerated to’ a relatively cool
90 degrees, with humidity 90
percent. ,

The mine, called Western Deep
Levels, is the world’s deepest at
13,000 feet—almost I 10 World
Trade Center buildings on end. An

army of 12,351 blacks and 978 -

whites daily risk their lives to
scratch an ounce of gold from every
two tons of rock.

Western Deep Levels, 43 miles
west of Johannesburg, harvests
about 263 pounds a day. It and the

other 34 major geld minesyin South “

Africa produce about 700 metric
tons of gold a year.

South Africa has 70 percent of
the free world’s gold and in the

yearending June 30 earned $3.7

billion from gold sales. Uranium,
once a worthless by-product of gold
mining, earned the country $1.3
billion. '

Mosutt Moatsdugha, a 35-year
old blackxminer from neighboring

-Botswana‘, is one of the 378,000

blacks and 38,000 whites who
descend into the bowels of the.

- earth every day in South Africa to

drill and blasts specks of gold to ﬁll
the country’s coffers. -

Mosutt says he likes it here
“because of the money.” As a
team leader, or “boss-boy,” he
supervises a dozen drillers and
“cheezers”—men who place ex-
plosives in drilled holes. Mosutt
earns $11.08 per eight-hour shift
and works 11 shifts in 14 days.

Mosutt clambers through the
jagged tunnels to make sure the
drillers keep hammering. In near
total darkness, pierced 'only by
miners’ lamps, the sweat-soaked
men half sit and half recline on a
bed of crushed rock and drill with
bone-jarring noise into the wall
containing the unseen gold in a
band and inch to~a foot wide.

Shirtless miners bathed in the
spray of water-cooled jackhammers
lean into drills. Their helmets
scrape the chiseled roof, pressing
.down at about 14,000 pounds per
square inch.

In addition to their salaries, all
miners, black and white, receive a
monthly production bonus based
on how many yards of rock they
drill and blast.

Mosutt, a stocky, full-faced man,
has worked the mines for 19 years.‘
He says he averages about $250 a
month, while a driller may earn

$130. That is a long way from the

white miner, or “stoper,” who.

supervises several black teams run
by men like Mosutt.

Johan Fouche, 31, a white
“stoper,” says he earns $800 to
$1,000 a month. Taking a
mid-morning tea break, Fouche
ﬁshed a cigarette from his dripping
wet clothes and said, “I used to
work on the railroad but I l_eft for a
career in the mines. The money is
better.”

He said the mining was
dangerous and about every 100
days the is a rockburst in one of his
shafts, average for the mine.

In matter-of-fact tones, the
miner said, “I had a rockburst
three or four months ago. One
kafﬁr black was killed. It’s an act
of God. There’s no warning.’--’

\ In South Africa’s gold mines, the
average fatality rate is 1.4 deaths
per 1,000 miners, or 582 men killed

a year. At Western Deep Levels,.

rockbursts kill 30 men a year. ‘
Along with the miners, plum-

bers, electricians, welders, riggers,

mechanics and engineers work on

"the hundreds of miles of spaghet-
tied water pipes, ventilation ducts,

and electric lines - . i

Few Face Hassles Overcomingiiiiiiii

Higher Piﬂ Tuition Costs

By SUE McFARLAND

Pitt News Staff Writer

Pitt students appear to be
unaffected by the rising costs of
tuition and housing according to a
recent informal survey by The Pitt
News.

Only twenty percent of the

students polled believe the tuition
hike levied by the Board of
Trustees this year had any serious
effect‘ on them, their families Or
their ability to return to school this
fall. .
“No one wanted the increase but
it was just one of those things that
we’ll all have to learn to live with if
we want an education,” said one
student. _

Some students, however, -did
admit to feeling the ﬁnancial
burden of the tuition increase.

“My father works in a coal
mine and with the miners‘ SITIKC
last year a tuition increase was
something that we didn't need but
will have to pay if I want to stay in
school,” a third-year pharmacy
student said. i
V The Schools of Pharmacy,
Nursing, and Health Related
professions were the hardest hit by
the increases at the undergraduate
level.

“They increased our tuition last
year and told us that it was because

of the lower‘ student-teacher ratios '
in the Schools of Nursing and

Engineering,” Janice Zozom, a
junior nursing student said. “But
this year the tuition went up $240
while Engineering only went up
$50. The biggest problem is that

o\"'G

     

tencies

 

‘ Ir,

PITT/(.)AKlC.>AND

no one really understands the
reasons behind the tuition in-
creases.”

The lack of explanation by the
administration about the increases
seemed to be foremost on the
students’ minds. S

“They never really told us why
the tuition went up," Suzanne
Wysocki, a third-year pharmacy
student said. “This year I received
as much. ﬁnancial aid as I did last
year, but the tuition went up,
therefore I owe more money this
year,” «

Students living on campus
expressed a similar sentiment a-
bout the 3.1 percent price hike on
University housing for the fall
term.

15 percent of the students living
on campus said the increase posed
any serious problems for them.

“We really haven't had any
complaints about the increase,”

said JoAnn Gibbs, assistant di-
rector ofthe ofﬁce of Residence
“The students that live on
campus and are paying the
increased price have signed a
contract and know for sure that this
ﬁgure is not going to change for at
least nine months, while students
that are off campus are forced to
contend with utility maintenance
and rent fees at almost any time.”
Gibbs believes this is the major
reason there is no marked increase
in the number of students desiring
on-campus housing for the fall _

Life .

term .

f‘We’ve attempted to make the
increase as nominal as possible for
Donovan

room and board,”

Hughes, director of housing, said.
“We know that the students don't
like the increases, but the 3.1
percent increase is small compared
to those at other schools in the city
this year.”

Belushi Top Attraction in ‘

BY CRISTOPHER C. HOEL I

Pitt News Staff Writer

National Lampoon‘s Animal House
Directed by John Landis

“National Lampoon‘s Animal
House”is a warped, crude, irrever-
ent piece of ﬁlm documenting the
deranged,
anti-social group of fraternity
brothers spends at college before
the beloved Delta House is kicked
off campus. It is an exceedingly
funny movie to anyone able to
appreciate the healthier facets of
college life.

The brothers of Delta. Tau Chi

_have been accused, usually by

older reviewers, of producing
sophomoric coinedy. This is unfair
and untrue-what “Animal House”
features is a highly intellectual
comedy spawned by the non-'intel-
lectual,but humor-ridden, areas of
life at college.

This is the fraternity that added

thousands of ﬁzzies to the big swim
meet, the group that delivered
medical, school cadavers to‘ the
alumni dinner, and the reason
“every Halloween the trees are full
of underwear, and every spring the
toilets...explode.”
. These are the advertisements
that preceeded the ﬁlm, and they
are funny. But the movie is
funnier.

John Belushi, one of the few
current performers who can induce
laughter with facial expressions
and ‘exquisite timing, i given an
excellent vehicle with which_ to

drive helpless audiences from their

seats and to the ﬂoor. . 
He goes to outlandish lengths to

~   Black Sabbat

By M. PATRICK MONAHAN

Pitt News Staff Writer -

The incredible phenomenon of
Black Sabbath. continued in full
force last Saturday night at a
sold-out and rowdy Civic Arena.

The heavy metal bashers from
Birmingham, England, never the
favorites of radio‘ or critics, have
always had a strong word-of-mouth
appeal on‘ the street to lovers of

extremely loud, hard, and tight

rock’n’roll. - A
17,500 of these people packed

'the Arena to the rafters and

contributed along with Sabbath’s
unique stage magic to combine for

  

 

spy upon the ﬁner points of Mandy
Pepperidge, the cheerleading
school beauty who'd not consider
even speaking to scum such as
Belushi’s John B1utarsky——at least,
not until Bluto abducts her. ‘

He demolishes the school
caeteria—and the _ audience—in
ascant few ‘minutes by day, and
after dark become a black-jacketed
commando whose -asignment is

placing a hated horse in the ofﬁce

of an equally despised Dean
Wormer.
As the term progresses, Bluto

'moves from his role as pledge-

master, naming the new Deltas, to
his rightful place as commander of
the homecoming takeover, survey-
ing the insanity from his perch atop
a two-story building, and scream-
ing, “No prisoners,” as his mates
tear apart the town.

The brothers of Delta Tau Chi
explode many myths concerning
college life. It’s not that they don’t

drink to excess, ignore every part.

of college’s academic side except

cheating, and take liberties with‘

their female guests. They do, as
rush chairman and confident
make-out artist Eric Stratton
admits to Dean Wormer with a
wink (just after entertaining Mrs.
Wormer at a toga party).

Rather, they illustrate that such
behavior is, not of necessity
perverse, or even had. The Deltas
enioy their lifestyle, and the only
ones hurt by their behavior are
those who deserve it. _

The “upstanding” members of
the cast degrade the Deltas a
“dumb,” “sick,” and, ‘_‘animal-;

~"ist_ic.” "But is it animalistic initiate.

A cult of organizers has been

inviting Princeton, Penn State and a
Free-agent team from Pittsburgh.
Black said ultimate is a big hit

that a girl from Mars who starts

N ew Who Album Excellent,-
Poignant Lyrics, Good Sound

By KEITH BRIAN
Pitt News Staff Writer
Who Are You
The Who
MCA

The ﬁrst thing you notice about
the album is the cover. The four
men of the band situated among
electronic black boxes. Their faces
have aged, they’re no longer the
bad boys of rock, but like the
commercial says: They’re not
getting older, they’re getting

better. ’

The L.P. holds nine cuts; none are
bad, most are good and a few are
great. “Had Enough” is a good
one, Rod Argent helps out on

synthesizer on this rocker. Roger .

Daltry’s vocals are as strong as ever
on “New Song.”

Poignant lyrics that evoke
thought to the listener have been a
characteristic of The Who for a long
time. They also have -_been aunit by

.. which a song can be ‘measured.

‘ ‘3.905” may be the title of the
third cut on the album, but it would
rate much higher on the lyric meter.

Eerie lines ridicule cloning and
cryogenetics while shining-light on
the folly of mass conditioning. The
electronic sound leans on the

futuristic but keeps its roots in rock

and roll. _
“Sister Disco” stabs at “mind-

less ﬂashing lights” and the other

accouterments of the disco scene.
Pete Townshend on acoustic guitar
makes a good case for music over
disco. I
3 The strongest songs on the album
are “Music Must Change” and
“Guitar and Pen.”- The former
features John Entwistle and Daltry
on vocals. The song builds its
sound, starting slow and mellow,
rolling up momemtum to crash into
hard rock, then quickly falls back
into soft, subtle sounds.
In “Guitar and Pen’? Townsend
pounds the piano and plucks the
guitar in a building tempo that has
become a Who trademark. , '
g The sliding sounds of the
synthesizer create a schizophrenic
atmosphere in the title track, ‘ ‘Who
are You.” Undertones build into

overtones as overtones fade into A

while combined voices repeatihe 9

piercing question, “Who are you?”

The album rings with clarity; a
lesson that the newcomers to rock
need to learn.

Sherrill’s current litter of Panthers

wildly successful season, but. after
spending a tough 10 days of camp

appears ‘ certain to reward its
followers with as. much excitement
as they could ask ofpa team.

A number of serious- uncertaint-

superb_ season.

will be a tactical disadvantage also
will be cause for interest in the
stands.
Competing for attention will be:
—'on one hand, the still-incom-

Qomplete looks to be the correct
word here);

——on another, the question of
whether an outstanding defense
will be able to hold even the

_ toughest opponents close enough

for the offense to catch, and, of
course,

—-—with both hands (but not at the
same time), Gordon Jones, leaping,
dodging and generally leaving
defenders on their faces and fans on
their feet.

Pitt seems to be headed toward
eight or nine wins before a bowl
Qténe; the Panthers’ explosive
talent would appear to ensure at
least eight victories’ during the
11- game schedule, but the unstable

' nature of such talent, especially

when it is young, surely will prevent
the Panthers from avoiding a couple
‘of setbacks.

'So, while the “We’re No. 1”
buttons are safe for sunlight‘ for

cause for Saturday afternoon’

blocks and runs with equal—and-
exemplary-—skill in the open ﬁeld,
is the most valuable and gifted
player to be" found on any schoo1’s

The incredible quickness of Pitt’s
undersized backs will be a problem

‘for opponents‘, but their propensity

for injury will be of no major concern
to backfield coach J oe" Moore, since
his corps of runners is substantial;
Pitt’s receivers will._be outstand-

  Panthers Finish Training;
Shenill Ponders Lineup 5

By BOB LABRIOLA

Pitt News Staff Writer .

The Pitt football team ran
through its ﬁnal preseason scrim-
mage yesterday at Pitt Stadium,
giving the players who are ﬁghting
for a starting berth one last chance

V to impress the coaching staff.

Head coach Jackie Sherrill
indicated after the workout that
decisions on the starting lineup will

. be made by the staff after viewing

ﬁlms from the scrimmage. The
lone exception will be the quarter-
back choice, which probably will
not be made until just prior to the
season opener with Tulane Sept.

-10.

“I thought I’d have that decision"
made, but now I’ll wait until game
time,” Sherrill said. “If one of
them jumps out at me by
Wednesday, I’ll make the decision
at that time. Talefnt-wise, they are
equal; I’m looking for the one who

- will take charge. of the huddle.”

Sherrill’ also was pleased that

V the Panthers survived the ‘pre-

season without any serious injuries
despite the rigorous practice
schedule.

“It’s phenomenal that we didn't

lose any players ‘t"6°"a'.' major injury,”
said Sherrill. “With the length of
the practices and the heat‘, this is
the toughest week they’ve been
through.” ‘

As the situation stands now, the
Panthers "will have three running
backs that will split the playing
time——Freddie Jacobs, Rooster
Jones and Larry Sims. Sims will be
asked to spell both Jacobs and
Jones depending on the situation.

“We haven’t been running the
ball too well lately,” Sherrill said,
“But maybe we've been working
on throwing the ball too much.
Overall, I’m more impressed with
the offense now than I was a week
ago.” ‘

The ﬁrst-team defense worked
against‘ the type of offense the
coaching staff expects Tulane to
throw at the Panthers, while the
offense faced a variety of basic
defenses in the ﬁnal scrimmage.

Pitt will go through controlled -

workouts next week to polish the
offense and defense, get everyone
healthy and work up a suitable
level of intensity.

“I’m tired of practice and Ithink
the team is too,” said Sherrill.

,“We weren’t ready to play the

opener today, but we’ll be ready.
next Saturday.’.’ '

The hitting, especially by the
ﬁrst-team defense, was crisp, with
Dave Logan, Hugh Green and Jeff
Pelusi involved in a number of ,

. tackles.

The questions surrounding JoJo
Heath—whether he will contribute
to the offense or the defense-
remained unanswered after yester-
day’s scrimmage. Heath worked

exclusively at .cornerback, but

showed he lost none of. his
elusiveness returning punts.

“I’m not going to waste him,” ‘

Sherrill said.

‘In the recent issue of Sports
Illustrated, the Panthers were
picked to ﬁnish 11th in the country.
Does Sherrill believe that is an
accurate assessment?

“l’ll be disappointed if we don't «
have a team that will ﬁnish as’
they've been picked,” said Sher-h

rill.

Excitement for Pitt Gridders -  

yards a kick in'Penn State's 10-7
win), won’t move them up in the
polls, but the. margin likely,.,,will be
forgotten if the Lions are undefeat-
ed in November. ‘

The Pitt-Penn State game, for
more reasons than Paterno and

Sherrill, would care to consider,
again -will be the most anticipated
and telling engagement either team
will face; For Penn State, Pitt may
"become the only obstacle clouding a
one-game New Year's Day shot at a
championship. And at Pitt, the

Penn State game should be the‘
difference between a good season‘

and a memorable one. ‘Either way, -- 9-

the 1978 Panthers should be cause
for Pitt fans’ celebration, even if
that euphoria evaporates a couple

- .of Saturdays alond the’ way.

 

 'ThePitt defense once again meets at the quarterback.

A resurrection as complete as the
one the Pittsburgh Pirates have

When the Pirates were humil-

was whether Pbte Peterson would
ask former Bugs; Al Oliver, Richie

. Prior to the series with the
llhillies, manager Chuck Tanner

anything less than a sweep would

After last night's game with the
New York Mets, the streaking
Pirates had found ways to win 1'22 of
their last 25 games and ch. ped
-the Phillies’ lead from 11? .to

,/ one-half game.

The pitching has been adequate
but »'hadn’t lived up to Ta;1ner’s
predictions until the six-game
sweep of theHouston Astros that
launched the turnaround. .]ohn
Candalaria has had a sub-par year
because of a variety of injuries and
personal problems. Bert Blyleven,
the Dutch Master, is leading thel
pitching staff in wins with 12, but
at times his performance was not
unlike the aroma of a ﬁve-cent

1 ‘ cigar. Only Kent Tekulve can claim

a superior season with a 1.74
’ earned run average to go_-along
with six victories and 28 ’saves.’='

Even thouh Bruce Kison, Jerry

Reuss and Jim Bibby have been

spot performers for Tanner to date,
the injuries to Candalaria and Don

. Robinson could trust this trio into

more pressure situation as the
pennant race thickens. .
Throughout most of the season,
much of the Pirates’ offense was
being generated by Dave Parker,

Frank Taveras and Stargell. Parker‘

has only one single in his last 12 at
bats, Taveras broke out of a slump
on Labor Day with .three hits, and
Stargell might be happy to make
contact with the baseball as often
as it has been making contact with
various parts of his body of late.
Omar Moreno on the other hand,

average and considerably more to
his on-base percentage; Dale Berra

“We always had the talent,”
Stargell has said. “I don't know

“There is a‘ certain element of
people in Pittsburgh who don’t
want to see us win,” said Jim
Rooker. “I hope we win the .

playoffs, win the World Series and 

leave town.’ ’

 

The Oakland A's and the New 

York Yankees proved that teams .
that ﬁght within temselves can win,
the World Series; the Pirates 
attempt to be the first team to ,
battle their own fans in the quest of

a world championship.

The best way to eulogize Len Barcalow, Pitt's 69-year-old
hockey coach whose bout with cancer ended April 26, is to

’ describe, through a team practice, the relationship he had
, 1
1j_

with his players. That relationship, in essence, is what Len
Barcalow was all about. .

Barcalow sat, lacing his skates in the Civic Arena dressing

room, joking with his team prior to the practice in which he

was to make ﬁnal player cuts. He looked slightly troubled,

"uncharacteristically troubled on the week before his ﬁfth and
final season opener. ‘- '

‘ ‘I hate like hell to cut some ofthese guys, ” Barcalow said.-
“They all try hard. They all want to make this club, but what
the hell can I do? You can only dress so many for a game. We
. have our first . gamecoming up next week, so tonight’s the
night something. has to be done.”

It was the same type of concern Barcalow often expressed
for his less-talented players, guys who saw limited game
action during the season. The dues-paying members of the
‘Pitt Hockey Club, a non-varsity sport, all had ‘a right to play,’
Barcalow always stressed, and he was tornbetween that and
the desire to win. Somehow, he was able to accomplish both.
Directing his players out onto the ice, Barcalow loosened
them up with wind sprints around each faceoff circle. One
skater ﬂew by his coach at center ice and said, “Come on,
Lenny, why don't you join us?”

i Barcalow laughed. “Hell, I did this stuff 40 years ago.”

Not that he couldn't do it then. Many often marveled at the

’ yway a man his age could glide on a pair of skates, which is

possibly why he demanded so much from his players.

 1’ ‘ A subsequent warmup drill and the lack of sharpness

accompanying it began to eat away at Barcalow’s idea of

{i perfect hockey. His prescribed lines of four skaters never

could materialize-—sometimes three and ﬁve, but never four.
Barcalow simply“ ' stood—patient, hands in pockets,
occasionally spewing a small wad of spit onto the ice—before:

“One, two, three, four!”

each numbered player should be. Lining them up for another
’ try,{‘he only became more frustrated at his team’s ineptitude.
“Four!” he stopped them again. “F-O-U-Rl Jesus, you
canft even count.” ' ' ‘ '
Later, to- unsettle his nerves even further, the team’s
clockwise stroll around the rink turned into a Keystone Kops
} comedy. 1 1

Barcalow skated down the line, pointing harshly to where A

“I said clockwisel” His sandpaper voice was still going
strong. “You can’t count, you can’t tell which way the hands

1 of a clock go, you’ll never be able to play hockey!”

’ Next, Barcalow and his assistant", Bob Montgomery, stood
at center ice while the Panthers 1‘ displayed a supposed
fast-action drill of skating, passing and shooting on goal.
Barcalow instead was treated to a showcase of sloppy passes,
tumbling skaters and missed shots. I

“He'll never make the team, ” he'd say to Monty, or, “That
klutz, he's no good.” 1 '

Finally, Barcalow erupted. I

“Two hands, Larry, you’re not in no spaghetti joint; .Rick,
stay in the net—you’re going way out of the crease like a
Chinaman...Put it on the tape...Atta baby...Now you got
him. . .Thatsa way to chop his butt. . .Whoaaa. .«.Good job. . .Get
’i_m...Score!” ' ‘

With Barcalow, the team’s pace quickened. The skaters
ﬂew, latching on to bad passes, making even more good
passes—on the tape. The goalie, occasionally beat by a great
shot, reached out for some nice saves, and he was staying in
the crease instead of venturing off like a Chinaman. Barcalow
was pleased.  ' p

“These guys are really great. Watch Larry,” he said as
Larry Gallick picked up a pass and scooted toward the
netminder. M “He’s going to score here, watch.”‘

Gallick’s shot went wide, but Barcalow’s smile was just as
wide.

.“These guys are something else,” he said.

Praise. One of Barcalow’s trademarks. Through his many
successes at Pitt, credit always went to his players.

’ “These guys are the best,” he often remarked. “They
deﬁnitely have class. Hell, any dummy can coach this
team—that’s_ why I'm here. , A

'Most people knew better than that.

Later, during an intra-squad" scrimmage, Barcalow again
became displeased. Players insisted on leaving their
positions, a wrong for which Barcalow often scolded his team.

“Alex, stay the hell over here! ’ ’ hesaid, pointing. “You’re

gonna get beat someday if you keep leaving your. lane. A“

sure as I’m standin’ here with a hold in my head, you're

gonna get beat.”
“But, Lenny,”

somewhere. ’ ’
“Well, break me some break next time,” Barcalow said.

the player retorted, “I have to break

V “Now stay in your lane.”

The players, chuckled at another one of Barcalow’s
trademar.ks—his wit and the ability to break the monotony of
a practice. ‘

“That’s one great thing about Lenny,” a player said later.
“He can get serious butstill keep you loose. He's a great
guy; there just wouldn’t be a show_w-ithout Lenny.”

Barcalow’s scrimmage ended with a glance of the watch.

"‘Ok, we’ll make‘ them run some sprints, then I can break.

their little hearts,” he told Montgomery in this last practic

before ﬁnal player cuts.
. “We’ve got a game coming up,” he said, talking more to
himself than anybody. “That’s the way it’_s_ gotta be.”
And that’s the way Barcalow was—a blend of gruffness,
sympathy and one-liner wit. He may have been a
hodgepodge of many things, but one fact remains: Barcalow
was hockey. -. ' V
“Hockey was his whole life,” said Grace,- his wife.
That, however, needn’t be pointed out in retrospect;

Barcalow’s dedication was evidence enough. Coaching for -

free never bothered him. Club members offeredvla yearly
salary of $100, but Barcalow never saw one penny after his
initial season. And months before his death, Barcalow made

arrangements to retire from his North Park job so -he could i

spend more time with the team.
.That Barcalow wasn't recognized by the Universitymay be
true (varsity status for the hockey club was his fondest

dream), but he was appreciated ‘by the only group thaf ’
mattered to him—his players. Their ﬁnal tribute to him took

the form of a plaque that was to be presented in the hospital.
Barcalow never saw it, though; it arrived too late.

“He would have loved it,” Mrs. Barcalow said. “It would
‘have hung in his favorite_ spot at home.” V

On the plaque, along with a hockey _Panther and the
player’s names, is the inscription:

“Len, for giving our team your‘ time, your patience and

your love. The Pitt Hockey Teamf.’
‘Pitt hockey will never be the same.

Pitt News Staff Writer

Knowing that the defensive
secondary is only as good as the
linemen and linebackers that play in
front, strong safety Jeff Delaney
believes Pitt- should have a strong
defensive backﬁeld.

“People think we’re going to
have a bad defensive’secondary
because we lost three of our
starters,” said Delaney, the lone
returnee. “What people don’t
realize is that our entire defense is

-fgtronger this season, which means

'/

  

we’re going to have a better pass’
rush.” " V

‘A good pass rush usually means
there is less time for the defensive
backs to cover the other team’_s

Penn State’s Clark

STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP)-
Don’t ask Bruce Clark how he
likes playing defensive tackle. He
may sack you. _ V

The 246-pound Clark, from New
Castle, Pa., came to Penn State to
be a linebacker. V '

Clark was sought by almost
every major college in the country.

‘*4 e chose Penn State because he

wanted to prepare for the pros at
“linebacker U.”

Coach Joe Paterno and his Penn
State staff must lead the world in
sending polished linebackers to the
National Football League, topped
by the Pittsburgh Steelers.’ Jack

Ham. ~

But when the 6-foot, 2‘/2-inch
Clark lines up against Rutgers
Saturday, he’ll be a down lineman.

Clark makes no bones that he
would rather be a linebacker. But

Defensive end Dave DiCiccio can

identify with the unsettled offense A

as the Pitt football team prepares
for next week's season opener
against Tulane.

“The offense is in the same‘

position we were in last year, ” said
DiCiccio, who enters his second
season as a starter. ‘‘I wasn’t really
worried; but the coaches were. They
didn’t have a lot of conﬁdence in us,\
since we were ’ a bunch of

the offense-can do as_ well as those
“no-names,” who in 1977 ﬁnished
among the national leaders in total
defense. . -

“They’ve beensaying we’ll have

to carry the offense for a while,”
DiCiccio said. ,
DiCiccio, all-state quarterback in
high school, believes the offense
has an advantage over the defense.
“They’ll have more time to tell
than we did,” he said. “We opened
against Notre Dame last season, but

( ‘this season we open with Tulane

" and Temple. Neither of those teams
are in the same caliber as Notre
Dame. » 

“Our overall schedule is tougher
this season than it was last,” he
added, “but we start out easier,
which will give the offense a

A ' break. ’ ’ ‘

While the offense has several
question marks to answer, the
defense also has some rebuildinglto
do. ‘

“We lost three starters from the

'93 defensive backﬁeld and two-thirds

of our defensive interior, which is
probably the most important part of
the defense,” said DiCiccio.’

“Fortunately, I think we have’ if

receivers and more opportunities to
intercept.

“Exactly,” said Delaney, a
preseason all-American. ‘_‘It’s the
people up front who count.”

“It’s not like we have totally new
people playing in the defensive
backfield,” Delaney continued.
“Willie Marsh and Mike Balzer
have been here as long as I have
(three years), while Lynn Thomas
and J oJ o Heath have been here for
at least a year.” I

Marsh _and Balzer are expected to
start at left cornerback and free
safety, respectively, while Thomas,
a sophomore, and Heath, a junior
and former tailback, are ﬁghting for
the vacancy at right comerback.

,With three new faces in the
backﬁeld, Delaney expects Tulane,

Booters Challenged by

By ANNA ARLOTTA

Pitt’s soccer ‘team will add some
international ﬂavor to its season
tonight in an exhibition game
against the University of Mexico.

,Coming off a 7-7-1 sason, the
Panthers enter the 1978 campaign
anticipating much" success in the
Western Pennsylvania Collegiate
Conference.
together a solid lineup comprising
speed, skill and experience.

«The tentative starting lineup for
tonight’s game ﬁnds six starters
from last season returning. Start-
ing fullbacks are Danny Hamm, Erv

and Lynn Thomas all have the
potential to be outstanding defen-
sive backs. Greg Meisner and Bill
Neill both had super ‘years as
freshmen and should be even better
as sophomores.” ,
Individually, DiCiccio, who plays

_‘the ﬂank opposite all-America

Hugh Green, will strive for
consistency this season.

 

. s

.The team has put,

the Panthers opening day oppo-
nent, to do much passing since the
Green Wave’s quarterback, Roch
Hontas, last season led the'nation in
completion percentage.

“They’ll be sure to test us:” said
Delaney. I'd rather we be tested
right away than later in the season.
“That way, if we have any
weaknesses, we’ll have time to
correct them, before it gets too
late.”

Delaney, a three-year starter at
strong safety, doesn’t feel any
added pressure heading into his
ﬁnal season. ’

“I’m relaxed,” said Delaney.
“Maybe later in the season I’ll feel
differently, but, right now, I feel
good. about getting the season
started.”

unwanted position seriously, .just
look at the statistics. Last year_as a
sophomore he had 56 unassisted

Seigel, Mark Nigh‘ and newcomer
Tom Liebenguth. Halfbacks are
Karl Nigh, Jeff Shireman, Craig
Connolly (last season’s high scorer
with'l3 goals), and Tim Pearson.
Replacing injured, goalie John
Bonessi will be freshman Scott
Thunberg. '

“We aren’t sure if Bonessi will be
ready to play tonight due to a
sprained ankle he got a few days
ago,” said coach Leo Bemis.
“This experience is essential for
Thunberg, though, as our back-
up goalie.”

Also out _of the lineup is
sophomore 'halfback Johnny
O’Hara. O’Hara is having trouble

‘ ‘I had great games against Notre
Dame, Penn State and Clemson in
the Gator Bowl,” he said.

‘ ‘Then I had some games where I
didn’t do half as well. I want to be
more consistent this season. I don’t
want to have a super game one
week, and a bad one the next.”

To achieve this -consistency
DiCiccio ﬁgures he will have to have

tackles

and led the team in
quarterback sacks with six.
In last Friday .night’s 10-7

Mexicans

recovering from knee surgery
performed last spring. /‘
“We think the problem with

O’Hara should be cleared up soon,"

and we feel he will be" in_ the lineup
for next week's game with Akron,”
said Bemis. ~ V .

Most of this team is healthy for
the game. The Mexican team, is 1-3
on their American tour.

“We’re looking for a win tonight
as long as we play hard,” said
Bemis.

Kickoff is at 7 p.m. at Pitt
Stadium. Admission is free to
students with a Pitt ID entering gate

 DiCiccio Sympathizes with Uitsettled Pitt

an injury-free season, something he
hasn’t had in the past.

“I had problems with my hands,
shoulder ‘ and hamstring last
season,” said DiCiccio, who was
redshirted following his freshman
season because of a serious
shoulder injury. “To be consistent,
you have to be healthy,” he said.

He points to last year's Florida

Clark had ﬁve unassisted tacklea
aided in four more, sacked the
quarterback. twice and caused a
fumble.

Patemo looks for Clark to"
become a tackle in the image of
such Penn State greats as Mike
Reid, Mike Hartenstine and Randy
Crowder, all taken by‘ the pros.

“He is one of the quickest and
strongest players on the squad,”
said Paterno.

Clark teams with Matt Millen at
the tackles, and Patemo has said‘
he can't imagine a better pair of
down linemen in college football.

“I don’t think we have ever had a
really good defensive teamwithout
outstanding tackles,” Patemo ob-
served in explaining why he
switched Clark from linebacker to
tackle after six games at inside
linebacker as a freshman.

game as an example.
_“I had my handoperated on 10
days before the Florida game last

year, after injuring it against
Temple,” DiCiccio said. '

He played the game with a thickly .

padded cast. V
“I was thinking about the hand so

much I didn’t play the type of game I ,

thought I could have played.”
