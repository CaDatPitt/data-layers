N o in ves tiga tion in
drowning incident

By Brendan Kevenides
Staff Writer

The condition of Pitt graduate
student Weiming Yu has been
upgraded from critical to serious
at Presbyterian-University Hospi-
tal after she nearly drowned in a
swimming pool at Trees Hall on
Oct. 29. '

Prior to last weekend, it was
uncertain whether Yu would live
because she was not breathing on
her own and remained uncons-
cious. Now she breathes without
the aid of a machine through an
incision made in her windpipe.

Yu remains unconscious.

An assistant nurse at the hospi-
tal who asked that her name be
withheld said that, despite Yu’s

poor prognosis, ”She’s young.

Black Week
conﬂnues
with annual

BAS bazaar

By Colleen Denne
Staff Writer

The Black Action Society held
its annual Black Bazaar in the
William Pitt» Union Assembly
Room yesterday as a part of the
events scheduled for Black
Week.

Donna Liggon, a member of
BAS, «was coordinator for the
bazaar this year. Liggon contact-
ed entrepreneurs to sell their
products at the bazaar.

Rachel Wilkerson, a distributor
for Scent Sations, was there with
a collection of perfumes inspired
by designer perfumes, but sold at
a more affordable cost.

Ann Sawyer Berkley represent-
ed the Kuntu Writers Workshop,
which is sponsored by the black
studies department at the univer-
sity. The workshop sold work
done by members of the
workshop. —

Piccalilli, collard greens, chili
and gourmet rice were a few of
the food items sold by Gertrude
Colbert of Rankin.

There were African day-
dresses, elephant—hair bracelets,
snake—skin purses and other cul-
tural items sold by Jamil Jami and
Rashida Brookins. c

Other items sold included
plants, embroidered purses made
by women in Bangladesh, ear-
rings, necklaces, greeting cards

can happen.”

The assistant nurse also said‘

that Yu’s body has reacted well
despite deep pain.

According to Walt Waters, as-
sistant director of ’the campus
police, Yu was found floating un-
conscious by an unidentified
swimmer. She was rescued by
lifeguards at the pool and was
then immediately given mouth-
to—mouth resuscitation. She was
later taken to Presby’s_ trauma
unit.

What caused Yu to loose con-
sciousness has not yet been de-
termined, but doctors are now
speculating that she may have
suffered a heart attack. No bruises
were found to indicate that Yu hit
her head, so doctors have ruled
out that possibility.

Food banks prepare for season

By Jessica Coville
Staff Writer

Large food drives made by
local companies like Westing-
house, Koppers and Equitable
Gas will enable 300 agencies
to be able to provide the tradi-
tional Thanksgiving dinner
with all the trimmings.

Local companies have ‘con— *

tributed ‘onja total average of
230,000 pounds of food every

1 month of the year to the Great-

er Pittsburgh Community Food
Bank. The food bank then dis-
tributes the food to local agen-
cies such as food pantries,
soup kitchens, shelters for bat-
tered women and children, as
well as local mental insti-
tutions.

”We’ve been here in Pitts-
burgh since 1981, and it has

been a very successful effort,"

said Miriam Manion, who is

the food solicitor for the Great-
er Pittsburgh bank. The Pitts-
burgh organization is one of
200 such warehouses belong-
ing to the Second Harvest or—'
ganization. -
Second Harvest is the largest
voluntary, private—sector
provider of food assistance in
the country. For the calendar
year of 1987, the Second Har-
vest food banks distributed
400 million pounds of food to
130,000 local charities.
Most of their contributions
are from large food manufac-
turers. In the Pittsburgh area,
companies like Heinz and
Budget Gourmet donate ex-
cess stock. For example, when
Budget Gourmet comes up
with a new recipe for a certain
meal, it will donate all of the
remaining old recipe to the

‘ food banks. When Pert sham-
poo came out with a new for-

mula last year, its
manufacturer contributed the
old formula shampoo to Se-
cond Harvest.

Local supermarket chains
like Giant Eagle give massive
donations as well. Most often
chains will give their damaged
goods that their stores can't
sell to the banks. .

”We sort through what they
send us, and we get at least
50,000. pounds of food a
month that we can use for the
local agencies,” said Manion.

Aside from food, these
banks receive shampoo, diap-
ers, sanitary products, house-
hold items, and cleaning and

"paper products.

Nov. 6 through 12 is Na-
tional FoodiBank week, and
the efforts made by the Great-
er Pittsburgh Community Food
Bank will continue year

round.

Medical    
discovery
to speed
heaﬁng

By Mike Seperack

Staff Writer

Doctors at Presbyterian—Univer-
sity Hospital have announced
that they will soon begin human
trials of a substance called
hydroxyaptite tricalcium phos-
phate, or HATCP.

HATCP is a chemical that doc-
tors believe will stimulate the rate
of bone growth when a joint
transplant is performed. Doctors
expect HATCP to speed healing
time of artificial joint recipients
by 20 to 30 percent and add one
to two years to the life of the
joint.’Artificial joints today must
be replaced every 10 years on the
average.

Figures state that over 150,000 1

Americans receive artificial joints
every year.
HATCP is made up of the

mineral element of bone. It has,

been in existence for many years,
according to Dr. Harry Rubash of
the Falk Clinic. This is the first
time it has been applied to joint
replacement surgery.

Rubush said, ”|t’s one step
toward the future.”

According to Rubash, bone ce-
ment was traditionally used to fill
the gap between the bone and
the metal implant when a joint
was replaced. The bone would
then mold-attach to the cement.

Baker will stay on through Bush administration

HOUSTON (AP) —— President-
elect George Bush picked James
A. Baker III, a Reagan administra-
tion stalwart, as his secretary of
state on Wednesday but also
pledged a ”major turnover” of
personnel to reinvigorate the
government.

Barely 11 hours after claiming
victory, Bush announced a hand-
ful of key appointments, headed
by the nomination of long—time
ally Baker. Outgoing Secretary of
State George P. Shultz en-
thusiastically endorsed the
selection. '

”He’s big shoes to fill,” Bush
said of Shultz, ”but we'll get the
job done.”

Craig Fuller, Bush's vice
presidential chief of staff, and
campaign pollster Robert Teeter
will share authority as co-
chairmen of the transition team
that will plan the takeover of

power from Reagan.

In a declaration sure to send
shudders through the ranks of the
5,000 political appointees happi-
ly at work in the Reagan adminis-
tration, Bush said, ”I will, for the

most part, bring in a brand new
team of people from across the
country.

”And in my view, that will rein-
vigorate the process,” Bush said.

However, he carefully left
room for some Reagan holdovers
and veterans to join his adminis-
tration. ”There will be  a major
turnover but some people at var-
ious levels may be asked to
remain."

The president—e|ect said he
wanted to announce the rest of
his Cabinet ”sooner rather than
way late” and would think about
the possible choices during a
Florida vacation this weekend.

It is widely assumed that Bush
will ask Treasury Secretary
Nicholas Brady, Attorney Gener-
al Dick Thornburgh and Educa-
tion Secretary Lauro Cavazos to
stay on. All three joined the Rea-
gan administration in the past few
months.

Pitt researchers begin
‘ study of smoking habits

By Lisa Goetz
Staff Writer

A university research team

wants to know what causes‘

heavy smokers to light up more
often than other smokers.
Pitt's Smoking Research Group,
headed by Dr. Saul Shiffman, an
associate professor in the psy-
Q chology department, has spent
the past year and a half conduct-
ing a series of studies on light and
heavy smokers to find the
' answer. V
”Smoking research is an area
where psychology and research
can make a difference,” Shiffman
said.

   

The project has been named
the chippers program.

”Chippers” is a slang term used
by heroin addicts referring to
people who use a drug occasion-
ally but are not addicts, accord-
ing to Shiffman.

One study in the program exa-
mines the smoking habits of light
and heavy smokers in certain sit-
uations, such as when they are
upset or when they are out hav-
ing a drink, according to
Shiffman.

”The smokers. carry a com-
puter. Whenever they smoke,
they tell the computer. The com-
puter then asks them questions

Students rise to UHC challenge

By Michelle L. O'Brien
Staff Writer

V--

The University Honors College
exists to provide alternative aca-
demic opportunities to motivated
students, according to UHC
Dean Alec Stewart.

”We want them to be all they
can be academically. The course-
work is demanding, but manage-
able, in terms of workload,”
Stewart said.

Director of UHC Advising Kim
Watterson said students have
reported in their course evalua-
tions that ”they have worked a lot
harder” in UHC courses than in
other classes they have taken at
the university. -

”They all have a high degree of
satisfaction with the work they've
done,” Watterson said.

Stewart said that 90 percent of
students who take a UHC course
indicate on their evaluations that
they would like to take another.

This satisfaction is generally the
result of the ”volunteerism” of
both students and faculty in
UHC, Watterson said. ”No one

will ever automatically put a stu-

dent in an Honors course. You

have to volunteer,’’ she con-

tinued. ‘
Stewart said all UHC faculty

‘ must submit proposals for course

they wish to teach as Honors
courses. ”They’re [the faculty]
really committed to teaching

these courses,” Watterson said.

In addition to taking selected
courses to fulfill requirements or

' electives, students can complete

a Bachelor of Philosophy of Dis-

"roucH or GOLD

will be giving a

Choose from a wide selection of:

cipline degree in UHC.

A student can complete this‘

degree by fulfilling the require-
ments of the school in which they
are enrolled and completing a
program of study in UHC which
culminates in an independent
piece of scholarship to be
presented to a board of faculty ex-
aminers, Stewart said.

Watterson said UHC offers
courses in all disciplines and pro-
grams in the university.

UHC biology,,chemistry and
physics courses are most popular
with freshmen, and upper—Ieve|
students are often interested in
humanities courses, she ex-
plained.

Stewart said programming is
another important component of
UHC.

”We try to foster academic '

community among students,” he
said. UHC works to bring speak-

ers and seminars to the universi-
ty and encourages informal
visitations by scholars and other
prominent people, Stewart said.

Watterson said these visitations
are important to the Honors Col-
lege. ”A big part of the students’
satisfaction with their courses is
their commonality,” she ex-
plained.

Though UHC lists a 3.25 QPA
as a requirement for pariticipation
in the program, Watterson said it
is important for students who do
not meet this prerequisite, but are
interested in taking UHC courses,
to speak with a UHC adviser.

”The number doesn't necessar-
ily matter as much as the stu-
dent's motivation. The numerical
data isn't always the best indica-
tor,” Watterson continued.

UHC advisers can give students
whose QPA is below 3.25 special
permission to enroll in courses.

how they can apply it to their

This year, CIS is hoping to attract
more undergraduate students to
some of the seminars.

Glenn Armocida, editor of the

”We want [the lecture series] to

According to the assistant
nurse, Presby has an adequate
number of specialists, and Yu will
not need to be transferred from
Presby for further evaluation.

Despite uncertainty about what
happened to Yu, Waters said that
the police are not investigating
the incident.

”From what I heard, everthing
was done well. There doesn't
seem to be evidence of foul

THE PITT NEWS

We have just read [Mario
Oliverio's] article in Thursday's
[Nov. 3] paper. As three members
of the Resident Student Associa-
tion’s Executive Board, we are
genuinely concerned with your
dilemma.

Whether you are aware of it or
not, Mr. Oliverio, every student
who resides in a residence hall is
a welcome member of RSA.

We've done our homework
and found that you currently live
[in] Tower C. Your very own hall
council meetings are held every
Wednesday at 10 p.m. in the
Tower A conference room. We
don't seem to have any record of
your attendance. We're sure you
would be welcomed at these
meetings with open arms.

We think your  misconcep-
tionsof RSA need to be resolved.
For starters, the Haunted House
was canceled because of a lack
of participation. Too few students
volunteered to help —- it would
not have been a festive time. We
did notice, however, that you did

not offer any assistance.

As for your enthusiastic com-
ment aimed towards the Spring
Fling -— we've reserved a quiet ta-
ble for Cubby and Skip.

Regarding the Blood Drive, did
you know that every pint of
blood can save up to three lives?
Now that might not be any resi-

most donors receive some form
of satisfaction. _

Concerning our leadership
retreat, most large student organi-
zations have something like it. It
prepares us for things like, oh,
maybe how to handle misin-
formed Pitt News staff writers. If
you still don't get the picture, it
is something like Theta Nu Gam-
ma rush.

The next time you want to
write an article about a student
organization, please get your
facts straight. You completely ig-
nored the two winter ice-skating
parties, the Valentine's Day Gate-
way Clipper cruise, the Collide-
A-Scope, open forums to vent
your frustrations on the cafeteria
and STS and the Christmas Dance
—- to name only a few. Your very
own Tower C held a very suc-
cessful Halloween Bash on Oct.
27, and you must have forgotten
to sign the guest list because we
can't find your name. And when
your finals fruit bag arrives,
you've made it perfectly clear
that you want no part of it.

Consider this your own per-
sonal invitation to the above
mentioned functions, Mr.
Oliverio. [...]

Respectfully yours,

Heidi Klingeman
Donna Salovay

LETTERS

What about women's rights?

In regard to the letter to the edi-
tor of Nov. 7, "Fighting abortion
is simply an attempt to save
lives," what Mr. Lyons and others
like him are actually saying is that
a woman has "the right to do" as
she pleases with her body, and
specifically, her womb. She has
the "right," that is, as long as she
isn't pregnant. From the moment
of conception her "rights" are
withdrawn until after the comple-
tion of labor. Once she has

returned to her non-pregnant‘

state, her "rights" are restored.
This convenient moving in and
out of human rights for women
will have extremely frightening
consequences in the event abor-
tion is returned to an illegal sta-
tus. Each pregnant woman's
actions will be scrutinized. A
pregnant woman who smokes or
drinks could be held liable for
child abuse, child neglect or even
attempted murder in extreme
cases. [...] The mothers of chil-
dren born less—than—perfect will
have their prenatal background
examined thoroughly, and all
miscarriages will be suspect.
To proclaim abortions illegal
will do more than stop abortions;
it will displace women's rights of

Thursday, November 10, i988

and condemn them to reproduc-
tive bondage.
As a woman, that frightens me.

Good cause got bad publicity

The sisters of the Delta Phi Ep-
silon sorority held a balloon
ascension on Saturday, Oct. 22,
before the Pitt vs. Navy
Homecoming game. The purpose
of the ascension was to raise
money to benefit those with cys-
tic fibrosis. [...]

The girls were working for an
excellent cause, but nevertheless
received negative publicity from
an article in The Pitt News enti-
tled, "Balloon Launches Kill
Wildlife.”  This article states
that the balloons from these lifts
were landing in oceans and larg-
er sea and ocean mammals were
mistaking them for jellyfish, eat-
ing them and eventually choking
to death. One question: Why
wasn't this serious environmen-
tal issue raised when the Pitt
cheerleaders raised 10,000 heli-
um balloons before the Pitt vs.
Ohio State game? -

Furthermore, it was unfair to re-
late this environmental issue to
the balloon ascension held by
Delta Phi Epsilon for a few rea-
sons. First, the Environmental
Protection Agencey had no statis-

tics or information concerning.

nvolvement

area. Second, Tom Shervinskie, a
biologist for the State Fish Com-
mission, said that he highly
doubts that the balloons raised
from Pitt Stadium would have
any adverse effect on the environ-
ment at all. [...] Finally, ifthe bal-
loon lift was such an environ-
mental threat, the girls would not
have been able to obtain the per-
mission of Bridgett Guernsey, the
Pitt Greek adviser, Dr. Bozik, the
director of athletics or the Pitt
Program Council. [...]

lf environmental issues are of a
concern to The Pitt News, please
concentrate on those issues that
are pertinent to this area, for ex-
ample, air pollution, garbage on
thestreets or the pollution in our
rivers.

It Takes a Nation of Millions

Def Jam ’

Continued from page 9

Public Enemy, or PE, consists of
rapper Chuck D, ”court jester”
Flavor Flav, DJ Terminator X, and
their bodyguards Security of the
First World, or the SIWs. Their
latest album, It Takes a Nation of
Millions to Hold Us Back, is a rol-

licking, free-wheeling joyride
through a wasteland comprised
of right-wing rap-haters and racist
knuckleheads whose accusations
PE destroys with one, giant, sonic
bombshell.

Don't be fooled by what you

may have heard: PE is not your,

typical rap crew. These guys
don't yell about fly girls with Jeri
curls, don't wear gold chains, and
don't brag about their Adidas or
Gucci or what have you. They
wear street clothes, while the

SIWs don quasi-military gear to
serve as a reminder of the war PE
has declared against all who are
stupid, prejudiced, and narrow-
minded.

Quite simply, Nation of Mil-
lions is the funkiest, deffest vinyl
to emerge from the hip-hop scene
in a long, long time. Credit is due
to Terminator X for his manic
scratching, sampling, and James
Brownesque grooves that literal-
ly grab you by the collar and
force you to get down, or else.

Chuck D. rants and raves like
a possessed televangelist produc-
ing an endless stream of rhymes,
while Flavor Flav adds a much-
needed comic element to Chuck
D's otherwise heavy
pronouncements.

PE’s fame (or infamy) is due to
their message and what they
stand for. They are supporters of
the Nation of Islam, or the Black
Muslim movement, indigenous
to the United States. PE are also
se|f—proclaimed followers of
Minister Louis Farrakhan, who es-
pouses the doctrines of the Black
Muslims’ deceased prophet,
Elijah Muhammed.

Some of Mr. Muhammed’s
more controversial teachings in-
clude the equating of whiteness
with evil, and a desire for the to-
tal separation of blacks from
whites because blacks alone have
the right and ability to rebuild
their personal and social iden-
tities. ‘

Media detractors have claimed
that Mr. Muhammed and Farra-
khan are teachers of hatred for
whites, realized in terms of black
power and black supremacy (as
opposed to white power and
supremacy). Black Muslims and
Public Enemy deny such accusa-
tions vehemently, pointing out
that their message is one of black
solidarity, self-knowledge, and

heritage awareness.

Most obvious in Nation of Mil-
lions is PE’s outright militant,
hostile stance against the media,
the government, and the record-
ing industry (which, strangely
enough, is quite understandable).
In ”Don’t Believe the Hype,”
Chuck D. denies that he is a ra-
cist drug addict and accuses the
media of failing to understand
Farrakhan’s teachings.

The problem, however, is that
PE do not tell us why they con-
sider Farrakhan to be a ”prophet
you ought to listen to.” Instead,
we get a defense of Black Mus-
lim ideology in place of a much-
needed explanation of these
beliefs.

The concept of whiteness as
evil surfaces in ”Party for Your
Right to Fight,” where PE claims
that the CIA and FBI had Martin
Luther King and Malcolm X set
up under the supervision of
Joseph McCarthy, referring to
these federal groups as ”grafted
devils.”

Critics might point to these as
virile anti—white sentiments,
which is hardly true. The only
anti—white message PE conveys
on the album is directed at white

‘supremacists and white institu-

tions which condone prejudice
and discrimination, and it consti-
tutes a minor part of the whole
record.

PE’s overwhelming message is
of black pride, black unity, and
standing up for what is just. This
message, to many observers,
seems incompatible with PE’s
militant position. Flavor Flav
might claim, ”I’ve got a right to
be hostile, my people been per-
secuted,” but it's easy to see how
this attitude. can be misinter-
preted.

PE’s stance is aggressive be-
cause the odds they face as

minorities in police—state Ameri-
ka'are virtually insurmountable.

Hip-hop itself is considered by
rap-haters to be non-music, de-
void of any artistic merit. Such
critics miss the point of hip-hop

“ completely: it's not about clever

chord progressions and crooning.
Hip-hop is about beat —— that is,
rhythm, funkiness, coming down
on the one. It's the recycling and
regeneration of old sounds into a
new format to fit today's style and
demands.

In this way, hip-hop itself be-
comes an element of and a state-
ment on black heritage and
self—identity. The urban jungle
serves as the context in which rap
is created and assimilated, and
the result is a totally original art
form unique to this country.
What PE does is elevate rap from
the necessary bragging and
posturing to an outright declara-
tion of black self-awareness in the
context of non—b|ack hostility.

In addition, PE has been enor-
mously successful in continuing
the commercial precedent set by
the Beastie Boys, popularizing
rap at a national level.

PE is probably the most audi-
ble force against the psychologi-
cal apartheid that is too apparent
in the United States, and their
preaching forces you take a
stand: take it or leave it. In effect,
PE confronts apathy like no other
group; it's hard not to feel some-
thing strong after hearing the
album.

However, they have not yet
reached a point where their mes-
sage is crystal-clear. They have
yet to realize that releasing sen-
sationalistic statements with racist
overtones to the press only makes
the group vulnerable to media
criticism. These tendencies can
only lead to the very mentality

that PE opposes.

Chekhov staged at Foster-

By Jim Robertson
For The Pitt News

The Cherry Orchard, by Anton
Chekhov, is the most recent
production of the University of
Pittsburgh's theatre arts depart-
ment. The play, which is consid-
ered by director W. Stephen
Coleman to be Chekhov’s
masterpiece, runs through Nov.
12 at Stephen Foster Memorial
Theatre.

The story is about a carefree
older woman named.Madame
Ranyevskaya (played by Mavour-
neen Dwyer) and the impending

destruction of her cherished cher--

ry orchard. Madame R's free-
spending ways have gotten her
well into debt, forcing the sale of
her estate.

She is unable to accept losing
this one thing that has come to

symbolize her past and, indeed, ~

her entire history. So, she enters
a fantasy world in which she de-
nies the present reality.

In fact, all of the characters in
this highly complex drama seem
to be in their own worlds. Lopa-
khin, the merchant (Kenneth J.
Roberts), is consumed by a hun-
ger for money. His wealth allows
him to compensate for his lack of
social standing as the son of
slaves. He is of the most help to
Madame R, however, proposing
a plan that could save her from
debt

But the plan -is merely another
money-making scheme. It entails

the destruction of her estate, so_

the plan cannot be permitted in
Madame R's mind.

The other characters are of
even less help. They are all so en-
grossed in their own pursuits that
they are incapable of helping
matters any.

Meetings
are now every Thursday

at 6:00 pm

The characters are so often on

oifferent levels that when they do -

meet in confrontation on the
s ime level, the scene is very in-
tense and the dramatic tension is
at its highest. This is particularly
evident in the confrontational
scene between Lopatkhin and the
aaudent Trofimov (Michael
i:’:’)Wd).

The Cherry Orchard is set in
Russia in 1904, but its themes are
as applicable today as when
Chekhov first wrote it. The theme
that best comes through in this
production is the unstoppability
of time.

Many of the characters, includ-
ing Madame R, would prefer to
live in the past, when life was bet-
ter. But as the carousel stage
keeps turning, so too the world,
forcing changes in spite of some
characters’ resistance. This point
is conclusively driven home by

the toy merry-go—round in the fi-
nal scene.

The carousel stage is also used
to represent the cyclical nature of
the play. Everything goes in cir-
cles, this play says. Madame R is
incapable of change and thus,
will repeat her spending mis-
takes. Lopakhi 1 continues to try
to buy his identity And the world
keeps turning.

The acting in this play is by and
large very good. This particular
work of Chekhov’s tends to lend
itself to being overly melodramat-

INI-'-'lDEI.$   

By Joel Timulak

Showcase Editor

The Infidels are like an age-old
land mine in an out-of-the-way
field. Someday, someone’s going
to discover them, and the explo-
sion is going to be devastating.
And loud.

The guitar-heavy quartet is
from Youngstown, Ohio's indus-
trial graveyard where, for the past
six years, they've honed and
sharpened their sonic blast.
They’ve been a consistently big
attraction at the Cedars, Young-
stown’s premiere live music club.
Nowadays, they pack up to 500
fans at their shows.

The big thing about the Infidels
is their musical values. While

fidels have all but abandoned
their punk roots to embrace the
high-power virtuosity of Cream
and Led Zeppelin. indeed, the
band is good at what they do.
Lead guitarist Pete Drivere and
bassist John Hlumyk are the origi-
nal core of the band. They'd been
friends all through school when
punk exploded in the late '70s.
Like so many kids who heard
punk’s ”anyone can do it” credo,
they got guitars and eventually
formed their own punk band.
After’ several drummers, singers
and band names, the band solid-
ified with drummer John Koury
and singer-guitarist Tony Ment-
zer. The Infidels began playing in
Youngstown, and in 1984, they
had their first recording session.

 

The big turnaround for the

much of post—punk music has
group, however, happened when

been a legacy of The Velvet Un-
derground, Mission of Burma and

other experimental giants, T he In- They had more rebellious ener-

gy than any of the punk bands,
and they had musical sophistica-
tion to it all top off. After all, they
figured, The Who were the Sex
Pistols’ favorite band. The Infidels
began to grow as a band, writing
smarter songs but retaining their
bombastic energy. _

The band recorded ’’Mad ,
About That Girl/A Thousand
Years Ago,” their first single, in (5
1985 on Jim’s Records and, at
about the same time as its release,
they replaced their troublemak-
ing singer with David Lisko, a
Youngstown club vet.

Lisko brought with him an en-
thusiasm for the Beatles and the
Rolling Stones. His '60s ideals
and garage—pop voice met well
with Pete and John, who, by this
time, where old-school
thusiasts, listing the Byrds,
Easybeats and Yardbirds in addi-
tions to the Beatles and Stones as
their favorites.

With the new singer, the band
pursued constant practicing and
songwriting. In 1986, they
released Infidels X 4, a four-song
EP on Scream Records, a label
run by GeoffJones of 3rd Centu-
ry Management, who handles the
band. With its release, The In-
fidels’ pop—riffing and power-
chording drew them a larger au-
dience and signified a stronger,
self-confident style.

w in 1987, The Infidels released

Z where I Go” and Mad About
0 That Girl, a compilation of their

mostly in Youngstown and other
parts of Ohio and Pennsylvania,
their national (and even interna-
tional) popularity grew more via
college airplay.
That spring, they embarked
upon their first eastern and

Bone Of Contention rages  

By Dmitri Ragano
Staff Writer

Plenty of names pop up in any
conversation about the local mus-
IC scene. Bone of Contention isn't

one of them. For three years now,

the band has had to bear the bur-
den of being what George Bush
would call, ”out of the main-
stream.”

”We’re adults playing music
and I guess that's why we come
off as kind of different,” says
guitarist Shawn Lowly.

”We’re not cool,"adds Barbara
Madaus. ”We look like people
that just happened to be
together.” » ,

Bone of Contention doesn't do
a lot of posing and they don't pre-
tend to be a band of hellraising
rebels. No one's going to mistake
this soft—spoken bunch for Guns
’n’ Roses.

The music itself is hardly mild-
mannered. Everyone writes, so
the band never winds up repeat-
ing itself. From the rhythmic lurch
of ”Seeming to Believe” to fran-
tic workouts such as "Fractured,"
there's a refreshing mix of songs.

This diversity carries over to the
performances. Each member
lends a different approach to
playing as well as singing. The
results are often bizarre. Lead
singer Lila Shaara’s reprimanding
tone in ”Testosterone" comes off
like rabid Carly Simon. In ”Lost
Words,i’ singer—bassist Mike
Shanley sounds like your twerp
brother shouting into a
megaphone.

”Nothing is too weird for
us,"says Madaus on the music.
"We're bound to stupefy. I think
sometimes we're like an avant-
garde jazz, garage hardcore
band.”

For all their se|f—proc|aimed
weirdness, a lot of the songs are
as rock ’n’ roll as they come. The
band mentions classic acts like
Patti Smith, the Velvet Under-
ground and the Clash as in-
fluences. In the tradition of those
artists, Bone of Contention works
on the edges of the rock genre.

Even at its most conventional,
there's something innately unor-
thodox about the music. The
songs never come clean; there's

. always some kind of spin to en-

tertain you.

I nfidels—-

Continued from page 12
it over and start again.

From the opening, ”|nside/Out-
side,” to the last cut, ”Now That
It's Over,” the record isfull of
scatterbrained guitar solos, mons-
trous bass runs and all-out snare
attacks. With four singers in the
group, 9:25 has no slow spots but
has some decidedly '60s harmo-
nies, particularly on the record's
killer, ”Then It's Gone," an all-
out, vengeful, bitter and huge
tour de force of hard rock ar-
tillery.

In this day of one-trick sha-
mans, thin sounding rip-offs of
last year's Next Big Thing and
plain boredom, The lnfidels are
a welcome, refreshing scream of
what rock should be. It's about
time.

Check them out on Friday night
with The Good Earth (featured in
the Nov. 3 Showcase) and Hill
Hour at the Graffiti.

But entertainment and success
don't always come hand in hand,
as Bone of Contention knows all
too well. They produced their
own self-titled tape this year, only
to have it rejected by indepen-
dent labels.

Where has In Pittsburgh been?
Isn't that paper supposed to be
helpinglocal bands in their po-
sition?

”|t’s a crock of sh—t,”remarks
Shanley on In Pittsburgh's status
as the voice of l-ocal music. ’’I
sent them a tape four months ago.
They've done recent record
reviews and we weren't in there.
What In Pittsburgh is doing is bet-
ter than nothing, but it's still not
much more.”

’’It seems like you have to
know somebody, or there's cer-
tain groups that tend to get the
most publicity,” adds Madaus.

One encouraging new de-

velopment is the opening of The
Foundry this fall. This new addi-
tion has made live music more
accessible and affordable for
young people. Forget what
you've heard about the Metropol.
”This is the real new industrial
club," says Madaus.

Shanley points out The Foun-
dry is helping audiences find
music they wouldn't normally
hear: ”I was there earlier this
month and this jazz band, Rule
as a Riddle, played and there
were these young punks in the
crowd  they were really into it.
I think it's really good that peo-
ple are open to that kind of thing
rather than just listening to what's
cool  like old Bauhaus or joy
Division.’

Bone of Contention hasn't be-
come bitter in the role of the wor-
thy band that gets no breaks. But

SKINS

By Tim Azinger

Assistant Showcase Editor

The Volcano Suns erupted
from the farcical mind of Peter
Prescott, a previous member of

the now defunct, yet still popu-

lar, Mission of Burma.

The Suns began in 1984 in
Boston, Massachusetts, when
Prescott became anxious to dab-
ble in music once again. It had
been two years since the demise
of Mission of Burma.

Prescott wanted to maintain the
intense aggression of Mission of
Burma, while interjecting a
”goofy edge” that had surfaced
in his writing.

The Bright Orange Years and
All Night Lotus Party, the first two
releases from the Volcano Suns,
established the band with alterna-
tive radio and underground mus-
ic fanatics. These two albums
also set the precedent for the
Suns’ roaring musical jumble.

1987's Bumper Crop opened
the doors for a wider audience,
as well as satisfying the lust for
sloppy noise of their earlier fol-
lowers. V

The Volcano Suns have had a
different lineup for every one of
their four albums. This adds a
dash of diversity to the Suns’
work. While the base of the Vol-
cano Suns exists, every album
harbors a variety of musicianship.

The lineup for their most recent
project, Farced, includes the
ever-present Peter Prescott
(drums, vocals), along with
Chuck Hahn (guitar) and Bob
Weston (bass, trumpet). Weston
remains from the previous Bum-
per Crop.

Farced is the Volcano Suns’
first endeavor on SST Records. It
keeps right in line with all of their
previous work.

This album is filled with that
bash—on-your—brain power that
the Suns have worked so hard to
maintain. Prescott jabbers on
about who knows what, and yet
it all seems to make sense. And
if you listen very closely, you
might even be able to pick up on
some of his sicko humor.

The Volcano Suns will be per-
forming at The Foundry this
Saturday, Nov. 12 at 7 p.m.

Gus Is Gay isn’t 

By Joel Timulak

Showcase Editor

You want new music? You got
it. You can't get any newer than
Gus Is Gay since any time you
hear them live, they are writing
the pieces on the spot.

The central idea at work in
their music is sensitivity. Their
music is totally improvised, so the
five musicians and the sound
crew, light crew, and video artists
must constantly listen to each
other and to themselves. They
consider spontaneous creation
and unrehearsed energy more ar-
tistically valid than anything else.

Guitarist Steve Browne ex-
plained that they have two
methods of performing a piece.
For some, the musicians will
agree on a key and they will just
take off from there. For others,
they will just start chaotically and
find each other as soon as pos-

sible. ”It usually takes us about
five seconds to key in,” he said.

He further described their mus-
ic as ”conversation.” ”We ex-
change ideas and sometimes
have arguments while playing.”
What could be newer than one’s
current state of mind?

The musicians in Gus Is Gay
are Browne, who also plays trum-
pet, Tom Marinelli (bass, trom-
bone), Tom McCarthy
(harmonica), Steve Adler (electric
guitar) and Scott Turri (drums).
But Gus is bigger than just the
music.

Everything they've ever done
together has been documented —
recorded and filmed — so they
include their technicians as equal
members of the project. At this
point, they have a huge backlog
of video footage, including a
documentation of their sole stu-
dio venture; recording, mixing,
hanging out inclusive. These ac-

The Bar-B-Q Killers surfaced in
Athens, Georgia, in the early
'80s. Their first stab at any major
publicity came when their track
”His or Hearse” was included on
the 1987 movie, Athens In-
side/Out. -

Later, the KiI|e.rs contributed a
song, ’’Chest 0’ Drawers,” for
the Some EP on DRG Records.

They then embarked on a tour
with various other artists from the
Athens Inside/Out entourage.
Although the tour itself was not
extremely productive, it did serve
to spread the Bar-B-Q Killers’
music over a vast area. They were
no |o_nger confined to Atlanta and
Athens.

The Killers’ first full length LP,.

Comely, was released in 1987. It
more than adequately revealed
the band's engrossing affection
for disgusting and morbid
subjects.

Laura Carter (vocals and guitar),
Claire Horne (guitar) and Arthur
Johnson (drums) are the three
original members from Comely.
Drew Wilbur (bass) has taken
over since the release of the
album.

The Bar-B-Q Killers front a bar-
rage of unrelenting noise, capital-
ized by the shrieking and
groaning of their front woman,
Carter. She does amajority of the
writing, and her fascination with
feces and other modestly
grotesque things comes through
strongly. Lines like ”Gut juice
and gastrointestinal glop spoil the
view” are numerous on this LP.

Carter's crooning has been
compared to that of Gibby
Haines of the Butthole Surfers,
and the Killers can surely be en-
tered into this glorious realm of
psycho—sick drudgery.

It would be difficult to go into
the details of the content of this
album because the page would
be covered with dashes, used to
denote obscenities. That's how
deviant the Bar-B-Q Killers get.
The cover of Comely sums up the
album's general context: It shows
a bird, sampling the flesh of a par-
tially mutilated mouse. This is
decadent!

Putting all vulgarity aside, there
is a simplicity on this album that
ties the whole thing together. It
may be gross, but it's thought-
provoking.

The Bar-B-Q Killers will be per-
forming at The Foundry on Fri-
day, Nov. 11 at 7 p.m.

THE PITT NEWS ‘

By Matt Martin
Sports Editor

NEW YORK, Nov. 9 — John

. ”Sonny’f Vaccaro stood inside

the media room of the Grand
Hyatt Hotel, one hand burdened
by an attache case, the other
stuffed into the pocket of his bag-
gy gray jeans, talking to a few
reporters about the upcoming
basketball season, the Dapper
Dan Roundball Classic and a re-
cent Sports Illustrated article con-
cerning the most important thing
in his life — basketball.

It was Big East basketball me-
dia day, and Vaccaro was just as
conspicuous in his Air Nikes and
matching sweatshirt as was
Georgetown coach John Thomp-
son in his trademark blue blazer,
St. John's mentoFL'ouie Carnesec-
ca and his raspy voice and col-
lege basketball gurus Dick Vitale
and Billy Packer, shaking hands
with nearly every member of the
media.

But what was the attraction? Af-

ter all, this was the media’s in-
troduction to the 1988 Big East
pack, considered the best league
in the country this year. Again.

Well, outside of Vitale, Packer
and the coaches, Vaccaro, 49,
may very well be the most
knowledgeable basketball man in
the nation.

Then again, he may know
more than anyone.

An article in the college basket-
ball issue of Sports Illustrated cer-
tainly shored up Vaccaro’s
reputation, tracking his life from
his days as a high school coach
in Pittsburgh through his days as
a sports agent to a life of finan-
cial insecurity in Las Vegas to his
current status as a billion dollar
sneaker salesman in the Nike or-
glanization.

Although possible recruiting
violations and stories of Vaccaro
keeping company with unsavory
characters fill the story, Vaccaro
says it is about as accurate as can
be hoped.

Can Pitt-PS U ma tchup
mean as much to both
in 1988 as in the past?

By Vince Carey

Sports Editor

»When the Pitt Panthers (5-3)
face off against the Penn State
Nittany Lions (5-4) for their 88th
annual meeting this Saturday, the
scenario will be a little different
than in years past. .

Both teams are heading in op-
posite directions, at least as far as
the 1988 season is concerned.
Penn State is having a tough time.
They have lost to Rutgers (21-16)
and Syracuse (24-10) at Beaver
Stadium, a place where they
don't usually lose. Since 1979,
PSU is 50-10 while playing on
their home grass. The most they
have lost in one season is two
games (1979, 1980 and 1.983).

”I think for some people,
Beaver Stadium can be a little in-
timidating,” said Pitt free safety
Troy Washington, playing in his
fourth and final Pitt—Penn State
game. ”I’ve been around here too
long to let it affect me. I just know
that they are a good football
team, and we have to be ready to
play.”

The PSU defense has not been
up to its usual standards this sea-
son. The highly respected defen-
sive school has given up 2,841

New Pitt players see no difference in rivalry

Pitt vs. Penn State.

This is the game which all of
Pennsylvania directs its attention
to on a a cold Saturday afternoon
every November. And even
though Syracuse, West Virginia
and Boston College have occas-
sionally surfaced to the top of the
East in recent years, the Pitt-PSU
battle has been waged not only
for state supremacy but also for
the bragging rights in the eastern
United States.

yards and 18.4 points a game.
The Pitt defense has held oppo-
nents to 1889 yards and 17 points
a game, the fourth best defensive
stats in the country.

”We have just not played very
well,” Penn State coach Joe
Paterno said. ”We played a little
better last week against Maryland
[a 17-10 win], and I think that
some of the players feel a little
-better about themselves.”

Meanwhile, the Pitt offense is

on a roll. After losing three.

straight (to West Virginia, Boston
College and Notre Dame), the
Panthers have been able to re-
bound and take their last three
games (against Temple, Navy and
Rutgers) by a combined score of
1 14-23.

The offense is led by freshman
running back Curvin Richards
(932 yards rushing) and sopho-
more quarterback Darnell Dick-
erson (1,225 yards through the air
and rated 18th nationally).

”I hope we play our best game
of the year against Pitt,” Paterno
said. ’’I mean, we are/going to
have by far our best game to play
with them. We just have to be
ready, and I hope there will be
some carry over from last week.

Please see Pitt, page 21

And even though that will not
be the case this year, with the
success the Mountaineers are
having, the game will continue to
be a way for players on both sides
to settle their differences. In fact,
the contest has even torn families
apart for three-hour periods —
Craig Gob is a linebacker for the

Lions, brother Scott a linebacker _

for the Panthers.

But then there are those ath-
letes who come to Pittsburgh
from thousands of miles away
and find themselves thrust into
action in the game. From the day

two parts to my life, there's no
question that at one point in time
I struggled financially. Obvious-
ly now I think I'm doing okay,"
Vaccaro said, swinging his at-
tache without seeming nervous.

Vaccaro, the founder of Pitts-
burgh’s own scholastic Round-
ball Classic, has made Nike the
premiere basketball shoe in the
land, promoting it to over 60
major college’ programs whose
coaches shoe their players and
pocket the endorsement money.

The question was raised as to
whether Vaccaro had not used
his ties with certain players he
meets in the Nike summer camps
as a recruiting device, giving
them his insight into which pro-
gram they should sign with, pos-
sibly Nike—promoted teams.

”I do get close to the players.

24 years. The one thing I can say

is, if ever I did anything wrong-

white uniforms.

”l’ve only been here a short
while, but already I feel the pride
that this game means,” said Pitt
freshman place-kicker Scott
Kaplan, who lives in Coral
Springs, Fla. ’’I’m not quite sure
exactly what the game means to
me - I have some buddies who
go to Penn State, so I guess it's a
little bitof a rivalry.”

”There would probably be

some kid I alienated out there, ‘

and he'd go to X school and say
’Well, Sonny Vaccaro told me
this.’ Well, since that's never ever
happened, no kid has ever said
that I influenced him or induced
him to do something, I must not
have done these things. My con-
science is clear,” Vaccaro said.
A Vaccaro’s ties run deep in the
scholastic and collegiate ranks.
John Thompson has been men-
tioned as one of his closest
friends, and the Dapper Dan and
Nike/ABCD all-American basket-
ball camp at Princeton Universi-
ty gives him an added insight into
prospective players.

Vaccaro also handpicks the
Roundball Classic entrants.

”I’ve got a good feel for kids,
and with seeing them at the Nike
camp at the summertime  I
don't do it, just my own thing.
People tell me. What I try to do
is make the final decision so
there's not a committee.

Kaplan is not alone as a Panther
representative of the Sunshine
State. There are five other Pitt
players from Florida, including
current frosh defensive tackle Jeff
Esters (nicknamed ”Big Daddy”),
who has played a significant role
in his squad’s three-game win-
ning streak, coming in and help-
ing fill the void created by the
season-ending injury to DT Marc
Spindler.

”I have no trouble getting
pumped up for this game,” Esters
said. ”Just the way the seniors

NFL '5 Smith, Garner suspended for drug use

By Dave Goldberg
AP Football Writer

NEW YORK —— Commissioner
Pete Rozelle, who hoped the ear-
ly spate of substance-abuse
penalties in the NFL was reduc-
ing the league's drug problem,
Wednesday suspended two more
players — Houston's Doug Smith
and Buffalo's Hal Garner.

Smith and Garner both were
suspended for 30 days for what
NFL spokesman Joe Browne said,
as in the past, were ”violations of
the league's substance abuse
policy.”

That brought to 22 the number
of suspensions set down this year.
Of-these, 21 were for 30 days as
second-time violators; running
back Tony Collins of the Indi-
anapolis Colts received at least a
year for a third offense.

In keeping with the league's

DARE

policy, Browne did not disclose
the substance involved, nor go
beyond the terse three-paragraph
announcement that has accom-
panied the others. g

During their suspensions, the
players will be placed on the
reserved, non-football injury list,
required to undergo treatment
and not be allowed into their
teams’ training facilities.

The Bills said Garner began
substance abuse treatment im-
mediately after being suspended.

General Manager Bill Polian
said Garner, a third-year player
out of Utah State, ”is in complete
cooperation" with the NFL’s poli-
cy concerning reinstatement for
players who have been suspend-
ed. Garner was not available for
comment.

Polian said Garner would not
contest the suspension in court.

The Bills have now had three

to...

players suspended by the league
—- more than any other team —
but Polian said Garner's suspen-
sion ”is another isolated incident.
It is not indicative of a ‘drug
problem’ on the Buffalo BiHs.

’’If you're intimating that there
is rampant drug abuse on this
football team, the best evidence
that we can glean is that there is
not,” he said.

A third-round draft pick in
1985, Garner started one game
for the Bills in 1986 but spent all
of last year on injured reserve
with a knee injury.

Defensive end Bruce Smith and

running back Robb Riddick both‘

were given 30-day suspensions
earlier in the season, but have
returned and made key contribu-
tions to the Bills, who own the
NFL’s best record at 9-1.

The suspensions come two
weeks after Rozelle said he

hoped the problem had slack-
ened off following the suspension
of 14 players in August and Sep-
tember. The most recent was
Mike Bell of the Kansas City
Chiefs, suspended Oct. 21.

’’I think the suspensions are
having an important impact on
players who might be tempted to
do something with drugs,"
Rozelle said at an NFL meeting
in Chicago. ”Because there has
been a slack period, I would
hopefully assume there will be
fewer cases the rest of the sea-
son.” Smith, the starting nose
tackle for the 7-3» Oilers, has been
having the best season of his
career. .

However, he missed two prac-
tices in September, then was sent

home by Coach Jerry Glanville _

when he finally showed up. A
day later, after a meeting with
General Manager Ladd Herzeg,

he returned to practice and said
he had passed a league-
administered drug test.

Under the NFL’s drug policy,
players can be tested at the start
of training camp or for reasona-
ble cause, such as a first-time
failure or erratic behavior. First-
time violators may continue to
play; second-time violators get 30
days and third-timers are sus-
pended indefinitely with the right
to apply for reinstatement after a
yean

Most suspensions this year
have involved cocaine or mariju-
ana use, although one player,
Charles White of the Los Angeles
Rams, was suspended for exces-
sive alcohol use.

Two weeks ago, Rozelle an-
nounced that next year, the poli-
cy will be extended to steroid
use.

Quote of
the Week:

Pitt freshman tailback Cur-
vin Richards,‘ a native of
Trinidad, will play in his first
game against the Penn State
Nittany Lions this weekend
and, although most people
find Penn State's uniforms bor-
‘ ing, Richards has a new per-
spective: _

”They make them look
tough, like the [Los Angeles]
Raiders,” Richards said.

After learning what his
teammate said, fifth-year
senior free safety Troy
Washington said, ”You’ve got
to understand Curvin is from
Jamaica, and. he's probably
used to seeing people naked.
He's probably just glad to see

some clothing on someone.”

Viola wins American League Cy YoungAward

By Ronald Blum
AP Sports Writer

NEW YORK — Frank Viola, the
Minnesota Twins |eft—hander who
led the major leagues in victories
by compiling a 24-7 record, was
named winner of the 1988
American League Cy Young
Award on Wednesday.

Viola received 27 of a possible
28 first-place votes and 138 of a
possible 140 points from the
Baseball Writers’ Association of
America. Dennis Eckersley of the
Oakland Athletics got the other
first-place vote and was second
with 52 points.

Mark Gubicza of the Kansas
City Royals was third with 26
points, Dave Stewart of Oakland
had 16, Bruce Hurst of the Boston
Red Sox had 12 and teammate
Roger Clemens, Cy Young win-
ner in 1986 and 1987, had eight.

’’I didn't know what to ex-
pect,” Viola said from his Orlan-
do, Fla. home. ”I didn't want to
worry about it. You don't want to
get your hopes too high so that
they get shot down.”

Viola, the first Twins player to
win since Jim Perry in 1970, said
there was no reason to be upset
that he wasn't a unanimous pick.

”Twenty-seven out of 28, that's
not bad, is it?" he said.

Viola, most valuable player of
the 1987 World Series, had a
2.64 ERA this season and 193
strikeouts, ranking third in the AL
in each department.

”It took me five—pIus years to

find this kind of consistency. This
year is just a carry-over from last
year," Viola said just before the
season ended. ”It’s been a dream.
Any pitcher who tells you he
doesn't dream of winning 20
games or starting the All-Star
Game or winning the Cy Young
is a flat-out liar. I know that after
the season ends, it will have been
a pretty good year to look back
on.”
Viola, 15-2 at the break, was
the winning pitcher for the
American League in the Al|—Star
Game. His 20th victory of the
season came on Aug. 30, against
Texas. It also was the 100th vic-
tory of his career.

”Actually, the goal of winning
100 was more important to me,”
Viola said. ”It means you go out
there every fourth day, be consis-
tent and stay healthy. I just hope
the next 100 are a little easier
than the first 100."

Viola won 19 consecutive
games in the Metrodome over 25
starts between May 22,1987,
and last July 27. And he won two
more home, starts during the

Bush, Dukakis two of
many athletes in race

(AP) — When George Bush
was a first baseman at Yale, one
of his teammates on the school's

baseball team recognized his J

leadership ability.

”George was a  guy who we -

really respected as a leader," said
Dick Tettelbach, a sophomore
outfielder on the 1948 Yale team,
who later played briefly with the

New York Yankees and Washing-

ton Senators.

Bush‘s leadership qualities
reached new heights on Tuesday
night when he was elected presi-
dent, beating Democrat Michael
Dukakis.

Bush and Dukakis were among
a group of former athletes and
sports personalities who were in-
volved in this year's elections.

Joining Bush among winners
were former major league pitch-
ers Jim Bunning and Sherman
”Roadblock” Jones, ex—pro
basketball players Tom McMiIlen

Griffin
commits

Danny Griffin, a 6-8 forward-
center from Los Angeles Cren-
shaw High School verbally com-
mitted to Pitt yesterday.

The Big East Basketball Year-
book lists Griffin as a high
honorable mention, scholastic
recruit.

 

and Morris Udall, and Herbert
Kohl, owner of the NBA’s Mil-
waukee Bucks.

Heisman Trophy winner Pete
Dawkins was among the losers,
along with Dukakis. They were
joined by ex—pro football players
John Reaves and Dick Anderson,
and former University of
Washington football player Ge-
orge Fleming.

Bush was captain of the 1948
Yale team that reached the NCAA
final, before losing to Southern
California, 2 games to 1. He also
was on the 1947 team that ad-
vanced to the first NCAA final,
before being beaten in two
straight games by California. '

1987 World Series.

Twins Manager Tom Kelly said
Viola’s performance created ex-
pectations that were impossible -
to fulfill.

”He doesn't have an ’S’ on his
shirt," Kelly said. ”A lot of peo-
ple around here think he's Super-
man and is strong as an ox every
three or four games. There's just
no way.”

Although he has settled into
Minnesota life, Viola is a a native
New Yorker and at one time
wanted to play in his hometown.

”I’d be so close to home and

I'd have a chance to make so
much money in commercials,”
he said. ’’I was MVP of the World
Series in Minnesota last year and,
except for Disney World, I ha-
ven’t endorsed anything.”

Now, he's not so sure he wants’

to go home.

”The more I've learned about
baseball organizations, the more
I've realized that it would be hard
to go home again," Viola said.
”We may not get the big com-
mercial money here in Minneso-
ta, but we do get some privacy
and some peace of mind.”

He's so well-liked in Min-
neapolis that when a poll was
held asking whom the Vikings
should start at quarterback, Vio-
la got five votes. 

”He has a better arm than both
of them," a respondent said,
referring to Tommy Kramer and
Wade Wilson. ”And he can't lose
in the Dome.”

Viola earned a $100,000 bo-
nus for winning the Cy Young
Award, giving him a $1.6 million
income this year.

PITTSBURGH (AP) ~ Pitts-
burgh Pirates’ General Manager
Larry Doughty says he was con-
tacted Wednesday by free agent
infielder Steve Sax, who said he'd
like to play for the Pirates next
season.

Sax, who has spent his entire
eight—year major league career
with the world champion Los An-
geles Dodgers, filed for free agen-
cy last week.

”Steve called me from the
office of his agent [Jerry Kapstein]
and said he'd like to play for us
next season,” said Doughty, who
was hired Monday to replace the
ousted Syd Thrift.

”The call kind of surprised me,
but then l’m not surprised. It's
getting around baseball that Pitts-
burgh is a good place to play and
that Jim Leyland is a great
manager to play for. Jim Leyland
is a players’ manager,” he said.

Although the Pirates have

backed off from signing free
agents since their ownership con-
sortium bought the team in 1985,
Doughty said he would put
together some numbers on Thurs-
day and get back to Sax’s agent.

’’If we can do something to get
us closer to a championship,
we're going to do it, whether that
means making a trade or signing
a free agent,” Doughty told
WTAE radio on Wednesday.

If we think a player can really
make a difference in this club,
we're going to pursue him, but
some players are obviously out of
the picture.” Doughty said. ”We
couldn't give $6 million to a play-
er, Iike the Montreal Expos did to
Tim Raines.”

If the Pirates sign Sax, Dough-
ty said they would likely move
him to third base and shift All-Star
third baseman Bobby Bonilla to
first base or the outfield.

”He [Sax] told me it wouldn't

  Free agent Sax interested in Pirates Vaccaro

bother him to move to third,”
Doughty said. ”We’re going to
see how close we can get him in-
terested in becoming a Pirate.
We're going to try to do it. Steve
can play here and really contrib-
ute some offense and defense.”

Sax, 28, hit .277 with five
home runs, 57 RBI and 42 stolen
bases this season. His best major
league season was 1986, when

he hit .332 with six homers and ‘

56 RBI.

Sax’s brother, Dave, caught for
the Pirates’ Buffalo farm club this
season.

Meanwhile, Doughty said that
his chief off—season priority is to
obtain a run—producing shortstop,
and that he has talked to three
teams, including Atlanta and the
Chicago Cubs, about a shortstop.

' THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, November IO, T988

Continued from page 17

Other interested schools are Tem-
ple, Louisville, Arizona and
Syracuse.

The NCAA early signing peri-
od began yesterday.

He went on to cite Pitt sopho-
more fon/vard Brian Shorter as an
example. Since Shorter signed
with Pitt, he would play before an
athlete on the same talent level
who signed with a different
school. -

”There’s absolutely no ques-
tion,” Vaccaro said.

’’In fact, when we introduce,

the kids, it seems to be the
loudest ovation we get of the
evening are the kids that are con-
sidering Pitt or are going to Pitt.”

Don MacLean, a scholastic All-
American 6—foot-1 0 forward from
Simi Valley, Calif., who was con-
sidering signing with the Panthers
at the time, was cheered on loud-
er than any other participant in

last year's Dapper Dan game.

MacLean eventually signed
with UCLA.

Vaccaro’s reputation has taken
a beating over the years, even
more so since the release of the
Sports Illustrated piece.

In response to the claims that
he associated with less than
desirable people, Vaccaro said,
”When they referred to unsavory
characters, I thought that was
hard  I probably was thought of
as that a short time ago, so it's all
in the eyes of who's making this
comment.

’’I don't think that these people
in particular are. They're your
friends and they're good people.
That's all,” Vaccaro continued.

And despite the claims, Vac-
caro will undoubtedly continue
to conquer the basketball world,
something he once said was his
dream.

”Pitt is really playing well right
now. Dickerson and the young
tailback [Richards] really make
big plays. Plus they have proba-
bly as good an offensive line as
there is in the country. Crossman
makes all the blocks, catches the
ball real well out of the backfield,
and when they slip him the ball,
he is a ‘very clever and effective
runnen

”They are very solid offensive-
ly. Defensively, they are playing
very, very well. When they have
been challenged, they have
played great football,” Paterno
continued.

Through the years, this game
has traditionally been the last
game of the regular season for
both teams, yet the last two sea-
sons have ushered in a change.
Pitt finished with Kent State, and
PSU ended with Notre Dame in
1987. Next season, it reverts back
to the final contest, and Paterno
likes it that way.

’’I think it would be better for
everybody concerned if it was the
last game,” Paterno said. ”You
know, the state rivalry and every-
thing else. I prefer it because
that's the way it had always been
until the last couple of years.”

yards. The quarterback situation
is a little different. The Lions start-
ed out with Tom Bill, who fell to
injury against Rutgers. They then
went to Lance Lonergan, but he
also got injured.

Paterno was forced to use fresh-

, man Tony Sacca. He played fair-

ly well but was benched for the
Maryland game. Lonergan came
back, led the team to victory and
will start against the Panthers.
”Lonergan ‘did a good job last
Saturday,” Paterno said. ”He
took advantage of a few opportu-
nities and executed well. I think
the team responded to him.
Lonergan knows the kids, they
know him, and’ he has confi-
dence in himself. So he will play,
and I think will have to get it

done for us.”

Pitt flanker Billy Osborn grew
up in Wildwood, N.J. —— right in
the heart of Nittany Lion country.

”My area is a big Penn State
area,” Osborn said. ”Pitt and
Penn State were the last two
teams that I chose from, so when
I went to Pitt, I think a lot of peo-
ple were disappointed. It is tough
going home, knowing that there
are a lot of Penn State fans there.
That just makes it a little more ex-
citing, and if we win, there are a
[few] more bragging rights there.”

_ Bragging rights aside, the 1988
version of the Pitt—Penn State
game should be no different than
the 87 that have come before —
intense.

THE P|1T NEWS, Thursday, November 10, 1988

Pitt beats Penn State on way to Sun Bowl bid

At first glance, this week's Pitt-
Penn State game appears to be
not much of a game —— for a Pitt-
Penn State game, that is. No na-
tional title is on the line. No
major bowl bids are up for grabs.
Neither team is even close to be-
ing ranked in the top 20,
although Pitt could probably
make it with wins in their next

two games. Yes, at first glance,‘

this game would appear to be just
for the bragging rights of Pennsyl-
vania — a matter of pride.
Well, even on second glance,
this is a really lousy Pitt-Penn
State game. But there is a little

more at stake than just pride.

As you undoubtedly have
heard 15,000 times already, Penn
State is in danger of suffering their
first losing season since 400 B.C.
if they don't defeat either Pitt or
mighty (Almighty?) Notre Dame.
Seeing as how Pitt is 5-3 and ND
is 9-0, and how the Irish defeat-
ed Pitt, this week would be Penn
State's best chance to get that all-
important sixth win.

The Panthers’ goal this week is
a little more practical. Basically,
a win over Penn State would put

Carolina State left on the sched-
ule, getting that one more win
should not be too difficult.

Last week: 7-3 (.700), for the
year: 65-28 (.699).

”When you play PSU, it's spe-
cial. In terms of big games, Pitt
and Penn State is one which I've
watched since I've been involved
in football.”

”Being from Florida, I guess I
really don't understand it, exact-
ly,” Esters said of the intense
feelngs between the two schools.
”As far as I’m concerned, why
can't Notre Dame be our biggest
rivals? It's probably like Florida
State-Miami where I come from.”

Maybe Esters doesn't have a to-
tal comprehension of the reper-
cussions of the game, but it's safe
to say that he doesn't have a life-
size Joe Paterno poster in his
room right now.
