Pine  
Confident 

Of. Victory  

By BOB sM1zIK

Joe Pullekines, serving his ,

ﬁrst season ‘as Panther tackle
coach, showed that he is a
newcomer‘ to the coaching

profession by saying, .“There’s ‘

no doubt in my mind that we
can beat California." The Pan-
thers take on the Bears tomorrow
at the Stadium atl1:30 p.m.
Pullekines, who scouted Cali-

fornia in their opening two games, ‘ 0

was in sharp contrast to his fel-

(

low coaches who generally go into n ,0

ecstacy over opponents.
There were only two things that
had Pullekines worried. One was

the Bears’ quarterback Craig Mor- .
ton and the other was the chance .

‘of overconﬁdence on the part of
the Panthers. ‘
Throws A Lot

“If Morton starts

much as he does can be trouble-
some. He’ll think nothing about
throwing 20 or more passes a
game.
“However, Morton has been
' bothered by a strong rush this
season,” Pullekines continued,"
and I’m hopeful we can do the .
same thing on Saturday.”

Pullekines recalled his own ex- ‘ '-

perience in discussing the possi-
bility of overconﬁdence. “Back in
1956 we went- to California full’
of conﬁdence,” hes aid. f‘They beat
us 14-0 and almost knocked‘ us

out of a bowl. As it was We still‘ i
went to the Gator Bowl. Califor- —

nia only won two more games the
rest of the season.”
Have Talented Halfbacks
California also has a pair of tal-.

ented halfbacks to go along with A

Morton in Jim Blakeney and
Jerry Mosher. Fullback Rudy’
Carvajal completes the backﬁeld.
Panther coach Johny Mich- ‘
elosen expects to stick with the
same lineup that has brough .
him two victories so far this
season. ’

The defense on the ﬁrst team 1'

may be shifted around some,
though. Michelosen said,

‘ “There’s a good chance that Dale

Stewart will be playing some de-

fense with the ﬁrst team. Prob- ‘R

ably in place of Paul Martha.”
The coach also said that Glenn
Lehner will start at safety, re-
placing Fred Mazurek. Mazurek
will be used in spots on defense.
The Panthers, now ranked
eighth in the nation by the United
Press International, will be seek- .
ing theirthird straight win. Cali-

connecting '4
we’re in trouble,” said Pullekines. ‘

'2 7 -— ’fiiiiE.Pil RIF:-jlday, came.‘ 4. less“

Al Grigaliunas, once a grimy-faced child scrambling
around German refugee camps, used to burn chewing
gum from GIs. ‘ I

He hasn’t stopped scrambling; nor has he stopped

 chewing gum, but he has stopped bumming. He has too

much pride to ask for anything». His struggle for survival
today takes place within the bounds of 100—yard football
ﬁelds and University classrooms..

Grigaliunas wants to lead the Panthers back into
national prominence as a football power. He blames lack
of pride for the team’s showing the past two years. '
' Could Beat Any Team

“In_ my ﬁrst two years here I didn’t see any team we
should have lost to,” the Panther captain said. “We just
lacked the extra pride to be a winner. Not everyone was
taking our losses seriously. This year it will be different,

you wait and see.

“There’svno substitute for victory,” he continued. '
Where I went to high school (Benedictine High in
Cleveland) you just didn’t lose. It you did, the teach-
ers wouldn’t talk to you. 'l‘hat’s-the way I like it.”

Grigaliunas likes it here, too. For two years he has
been one of the Panthers’ most outstanding ends. Last
year he led Panther receivers with nine catches for 128
yards. ' .

_ Blocking Impresses Coach

However, it is the end’s blocking ability that’impress-

es his coach’, Ernie Hefferle: Hefferle considers Grigal-

f iunas the best downﬁeld b1ocker'he’s seen here in- ten

ears. ~
y “I’ve been well drilled in the fundamentals,”
"Grigaliunas explained, “and I love to block. You
never know when your block will be the one that
might spring a back for a touchdown.” .
4 The 190-pound end has achieved as much success in
the classroom as on the football ﬁeld. Last semester the
industrial engineering major had a 3.6 QPA. He intends
to continue his education further in graduate school.
Grigaliunas had many football scholarship offers,
but elected to come here because of the educational
-opportunities. “I. had many scholarship offers,” he,
said, “But I narrowed my choice to Pitt and Ohio
‘State. Most of my buddies went to Ohio State — all
but one ﬂunked out — But I chose Pitt because I
thought I could get a better education here.” .
- Grigaliunas might never have played football at‘all
if it weren’t for the German soldiers Who drove the Bus-
‘sians out of Lithuania in World War II. The Germans
helped them get to South Germany where they stayed
until the end of the war.

AL GRIGALIUNAS, Panther left end and captain, has been one
of the chief reasons for the Panthers’ ﬁne season thus far. Besides
being a ﬁne receiver Grigaliunas excels on defense and on block-
