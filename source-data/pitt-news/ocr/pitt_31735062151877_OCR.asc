ites Francais,” will be published.
Miriam Harter plans to tell the unit
about her experiences at school in
Paris. Next semester the unit hopes
to have Miss Blossom Henry, assist-

ant professor of modern languages,

and Mlle. Levy address them.

Just before. Christmas vacation th-e
Dramatic Discussion Unit and the
Literary Unit held a joint tea at
Heinz House. At this affair Miss
Thyrsa Amos, dean of women, re-
viewed the current play, “Dead End.”

The Dramatic Discussion Unit is
planning to see “Hamlet” and “The

Valentine dinner next month they
plan to present a play.

Jean Barnes, C38, advisor to the

tion.”

Morley, the ﬁrst speaker for the
negative said that passage of such a.
law will not eliminate underhanded
methods of" employers. The idea
must be made workable, he said, and
some speciﬁc plan must be worked
out for it. p

The Oregonian summed up his
points by resorting to the time-hon-
ored quotation, “Don’t change horses
in the middle of the stream.”

McKee, the second speaker for the
affirmative, cited the success of simi-
lar laws in other countries, especially
the British Empire. He said that
the plan would advocate minimum
wages for only the sub-standard
workers, not for the great mass of
laborers. -

The law, according to the Univer-
sity debater, would not attempt to
set up a standard of living, but
would merely abolish sweatshop con-

ditions. Congress only can effectively

administer this law, he said. '
The rebuttal arguments were sharp
and at times facetious.

labor legislation and the aﬂirmative
declaration that something must be
done to better the condition ofthe
sub-standard workers.

bled on it. When “the. ball came
around to Marshall Goldberg, the
sensational halfback, Biggie aimed
at a spot -beneaath Joe's‘ signature.
Before. Biggie could write, how-
ever, Joe E. turned the.-». ball. over
and mouthed, “Oh, no you don't,
no V01.-Lmlonlt. If; you au.togrs.phcd;

Look, Mr. Smith . . .

And speaking of" Goldberg, there’s
another gem making the rounds about
Biggie. Remember several days ago
when Chet Smith, the Press sports
editor, claimed the “best” story. com-
ing out of California. about Biggie?
Chet’s story, as good as ourmemory
can recall it, went something like this:

When Patrick came. into the game
.carly—in the. secon-d.qua~rte1_-, Biggie,
coming out of a. huddle. asked:
“Say, Frank, what time is it?”

“Why,iit’s a quarter after three,
Biggie,” replied Frank.

“Gee, that means it's a_ quarter
laftert, six back in Elkins," popped
the hard-driving halfback.

Well, we don't like to disagree with
Mr. Smith, but there-’s a- better’ story
‘around about Goldberg. To appre-
ciate it, you have to know about the
press agent stuff up in New York be-
fore the Fordham game ‘between Big-
gie and Olivia de Haviland, one of’
the more lovely screen stars. News-
papers at that time had Biggie dating‘

Olivia, and Olivia ﬂying especially to ,

New York that Saturday to watch
Biggie in action against the big city’s
pride and joy, Fordham. Then be-
fore the Panthers left for the coast,
a rumor had it that Biggie had a

Well Done, M y..Lad . . .

But one of the best of the serious
tales that go round and round cen-
ters around Curly Stebbins, the Pan-
ther’s speedy halfback, who tripped
tofame in the Ohio State game. Any-
one that knows Curly,. knows also
that Curly has a very fine set of vocal
musical cords. He can really sing—--
a tenor voice. ,

In the evening of‘the day that
the Panthers Hollywooded, all of
the little Panthers got all dressed.
up, shaved off the beards that scared
Washington into submission, and
went to tread the measure at the

. very swanky Cocoanut Grove. (Inci-
dentally, this is the place where
big ol' Don Hensley swung ‘fwcll,
three-yor four times with Martha
Raye." She basgsincn becomelcw
gagcd . . . I

But getting back to Stebbins. we’ll
leave Hensley stebbin’ on the trim
toes of Martha Raye and get on into
the story. Well, after the little Pan-

thers got acclimated at the‘Cocoanut'

Grove they wanted Curly to do a. bit
of a song with; Jan Gerber, who was
playing there.

A little persuasion and Curly
was up there giving the lads and
lassios of‘ Hollywood 11- mg. - If you
know Curly you know that he sings
very well and you know also that
his song was a hit.

But this is what you might not
know . . . that Stebbins was offered’
a contract to sing with Ben Bernie
and all the lads on a network pro-

gram starting January 19 as a result

of his song in the Cocoanut Grove
spot. We understand Curly pt‘:-
ferred Pitt. and refused the solfer.

Ziﬁ‘ It Matters . . .

‘You may remember Sid: Zilf,
sports writer on the Los Avngclos
Examiner, andhis very nasty pre-
game remarks about the Panthers.
After the Panthers had blotted the
Huskies from Pasadena to Seattle
’via~.Route- U. S. Power, Mr. Z'iff~ felt
very sorry that he had blotted‘ out
.his-brains. So immediately follow-
ing the New Year blatting, Mr. Ziﬁ
sent a telegram to Dr. Sutherland"
and apologized very meckly, saying
that he, Mr. Ziff. had made an: aw-
ful mistake, that he had vastly mis-
judged the Panthers, that he had
underrated them, and that he was
sorry. I ~
Well, Dr. Su'therland was in a very
good humor that day. He would have
forgiven anything that day from

crackers in bed to bed-sheets" in ‘soup.
So Jock sent a reply stating that Mr-

Ziff’s mistake was excusable, adding;

_ “I’v-e made a few mistakes, too!”

Early Drills

 

If ﬂashy skating; clashing hockey
sticks and pucks shooting into the
goals at a fast pace at 7 o’clock in
the morning is any indication, Pitt

will -have a-. hockey team. The first

early morning tryout found about a
dozen Pitt students reporting last
Friday at Duquesne Garden.
Although’ lacking practice, the
groupmade a good‘ showing: "Play

revolved: around Bob Schooley, Bill;
,Ma.rshall, co.-student sponsors, Dick

Friday and Ed Kennedy. Other pro-
spective‘ Panther players on the ice
were Carl Heinrich, Taylor Britton,
Bob Lowe, Walter Lovett, Charles
Cornick. Practicing at the same
time were the Tech and Duquesne
players. ’

Another practice has been called"
for 7 o’clock'Wednesday‘morning in.

the-. Garden.

According to Schooley, this next
practice will ﬁnd a bigger turnout
than the previous one because several
experienced hockey players will re-
port for the first time. The grou ’s

diﬁiculties will be smoothed by t is

time because the players have se-
cured suﬁicient equipment to permit

To Strong F&M
Grapplers, 36-0

 

According to the I-‘anther wrestler.-',
Lancaster, Pa... is a place full of ris-
ing mats and whitewash.

Yesterday the Pitt outﬁt, still
searching for that first victory, re-
turned to Pittsburgh smarting under
a coat of whitewash, 36-0, which was
spread on by a- strong Franklin and

Marshall grappling team Saturday
night.
It seemed. that those mats just.‘

wouldn't stay down and five of ’em.
came up to slap Panther boys in the
back. Of the other tllroc matches

» I HIS is the melancholy. time of the year when
premature spring weather goes unnoticed

.‘and the library suddenly becomes very crowded

indeed,-and all the professors kindly shove the
deadline on term papers and long themes forward

three weeks so that “you won’t‘ be bothered with

them when ‘the ﬁnals come.” It is only natulral
then that 'we...._§}£1d$jn§§, should skip‘ reading F1“
News editorials andlforget that these are trouble-
some times. forthe. world at large. After all,
we ﬁgure, the strikes in the automobile industry
don’t affectlus nearly as much right now as a
passing grade in history. ' ,

Which is, of course. where we are wrong.
Whether or not some millions of American la-
borers gain the right of collective bargaining is
vastly more important to the individuallstudent
than the state of his _..b1ueprin_t. _ .

Soon enough we will join those millions. Soon
enough, too, _the"col1ege students of tcday_ Will
become thevoters of tomorrow and,’ collectively,
will have a share indeciding the future of these
United States. 4

Our education Should. obviously then, not be
a thing apart from the world into which we are

to step. The pursuit of knowledge canfhe an in-
teresting and, occasionally, for the favored few,

an exciting thing. But that knowledge should be

more than a hastypcrammving of meanltigless facts
to passlla course, sh'o'u‘ld be more even than an

objective study of what men have said andjdone.

in the past; It must include a study of What men
are saying and doing r .r..v_.-it now. It must include
a deﬁnite point of view on the struggles of our
fellow citizens_ for certain rights in this year 1937.

We college ‘students are-not, or should not be,

A living in a sort of cloister, thinking only of
things which will have no signiﬁcance once we,

get our degrees.~ There-is blood and senseless-
ness in the’wo.rld- outside and perhaps some day
we can do something about it. In the meantime
our education might well include., .as preparation

for the future, a knowledge of present labor con-
ditions and the forces behind those conditions

as well as the knowledge of textbooks and ath-
letic scores. A

 

vicar, 

ETURNIN G from whatzardent Pittsburghersh

may modestly term‘ the most successful

western expedition since Lewis and Clark, the

Panther football team has brought with it a host
of pleasant memories, considerable prestige, large
measures of glory, and $95,000 in cash.

The memories . . . they will serve their time
in th'e'minds of the players. The glory and the
prestige . . . they will be added‘ to that which
the Panthers compound annually on; the gridiron.
That leaves the $95,000. About $35,000 of this
has been disbursed for trip expenses, making the
remaindcr—roughly—a total of $60,000.

This money may go toward reducing the
bonded indebtedness of the Stadium. But it is
a cinch that none of the bondholders dreamed at

the close of the past regular season that Pitt’

would pluck a $60,000 rose out of the California
bowl. And if the bondholderswill not; then,

miss this rather unexpected New Year’s_ Day.»

pay-off,‘ The Pitt News suggests another’;‘use*’for

that $60,000 gift . . . ’
FOR years there ‘has been an’ obvious need here
for a building to house adequately the various
indoor sports. Any student who "has attended
basketball games at the Stadium pavilion realizes
the unnecessary hazards under which the players
perform, as "well as the treacherous‘ mountain-
.cli nbing required of the spectators, who see
-then-at best-— only about one-half of the play-
ing floor. Even more shameful are the present
facilities ;‘.,»i indoor track. «That no serious in-
jury has occurred to rainy of the large army of
students who run and jump there. is a- miracle to
everyone who has seen the place.  and

“Pitt:

wrestling enthusiasts are seldom cramped for
space, but if these sports are ever to draw spec-
tators. then bettcr vantage points must be pro
vided. . '

In short, we are conﬁdent that anyone who is
acquainted with these conditions will attest that
Pitt needs a field house, and needs it badly. Nor
could anything bc.morc of a boon to the Uni-
versity intramural sports program. now strug-
gling for a foothold, than suitable facilities to
let it prosper. . . .

l The Time Has Come

Vl‘O “I~IAVE._ advanced such a proposition last!

year, with the C_athcdral’s completion in
doubt, would have been foolish. But with prog-
ress being made on the Cathedral and with the,
occupancy of the much-need library, there is now
a ﬁne opportunity’ for the University to take up

the slack in another spot——its athletic facilities.-

For a school of its size to offer one basketball
floor for student--use, one other ﬂoor of Gi‘ade«D
calibre 7.for the type of games played here. and
an indoor track that is a menace, this hardly can
becalled proper. The body and mind are too

'closely'ass_oc-iated in development to skimp so

markedly.

Adequate housing and facilities for such work’
-form the first step in such a program. With

$60,000 head start, thercshould be little difficulty
in ﬁnancing a structure on the order of West
Virginia‘ University’s in Morgantown. Offhand
the plot of University land where the old 

_Hut» stands appears asan appropriate site. How-

ever, details are of minor "importance now. We
wish first strongly to urge students, the admin-
istration, and the athletic council to consider the

‘opportunity that is presented to us now.

The Rose Bowl victory of 1937 will live long

in Pitt men's memories. But if from that glorii ‘

ous triumph could come a permanent structure
such as this, the memory of these boys—who
through pure determination placed Pitt spirit on
a new level-—-will‘ live as long as those walls

stand. _"Call it “Victory Hall," but no matter

what the name, never an undergraduate will step

through its -gates without knowing the history 

of the building and the ‘thing it represents.
In time, only ‘with such a building can we be
proportio_nately as proud of"a temple for build-

«ing Pittsburgh’s strength‘ and health as we now

are proud of our magniﬁcent temple for the shap-
ing of Pittsburgh’s minds and manners. This is
the hour to start.

AEP i pledges got together and put on a sliiiirlig for

‘the actives last night at the home of Selma l{_oi'wit7. . . .

Last Sunday night the DPhiE’s had a gathering at their
apartment just to convince each other that vacation

was really and truly over. ' .
Saturday. Night . . .

To the Delts it was open house, and over at the
Kappa house it meant that four young ladies, not on-
tirely unknown to you, donned thosc Kappa keys, also
not entirely unknown to you. The iianies? Oh yes,
Mary Jane Beachler, Peggy Donlcy, Jane Key, and
Betsy Caldwell. Also (still speaking of Sziturday night),
the T-heta’s had an 0pCn"ll0uSL"'.

Conventionalities . . . .

While most of “you all” were gettiiig caught up on
back work over vacation, pause, two Greek groups were
sailing through a national and a district convention,
lffoth held a't“tliei -Scheiiley. Evelyn Bortz was initiaterl
during the Phi Sig district convention; when you ask
the Pi Lam’s about their national round-up, the boys
just smile and smile. We could tell you about balls,
banquets and ‘such, but we're sure that you l'€‘.t't(l the
papers, too._ ‘

More Initiates . . _ ‘

This time it was the Phi l9lp’s, and the lads immedi-
atcly concerned were Falk..Arnheim and William Egan'-
m-an . . . Kappa Alpha Phi is planning a father and
son banquet for Saturday night with Judge Joseph
Richardson of the Common Pleas Court as the fe,atui'cd
speaker.

Pitt men should look into this matter of the Alpha
Sigma Phi’s from Tech——you know that Ginnic Ku'nkle’s
intended is one, .but maybe you didn't know that‘Dotty
Wireback, also a ZTA, has also announced her engage-
ment to Roy Gibson, who is -also a Tech ASPhi. .

Harriet Rosenberg, a last year's grad, is honeymoon-
ing in Bermuda; she was married to Samuel Goldberg

It was _1_'ecalled that the Chaiicel'lo1‘="1liad" sti*es.<c<l tli.-at 

the Chapel was to.be»iiit'er.de'tio'%1ination. Almost all of
the 9,000. students enro1led"a4t§t e Universit.y have some
church: aﬂiliatiqns, _he said._-_  '

‘ Therefore, Di‘. Bowman pointed out, it would be im-
practical and undesirable to detfact students from their
own places of"?-’worship. The Chapel will serve as a
symbol of spirituality for the student, and will be llS€(l
by groups of students of the same faith for meetings
of religious nature from time to time.

The completed Chapel will be built of limestone in-
side and out. The interior will be adorned with quar-
tered oak ,a;1d;~r’G11astavino tile vaults, with :1 floor of
crab-orchard stone. -

Architects’ drawings of the chapel show a lofty :.-'l'yle
recalling the Sainte Chapelle of Paris with its sweopiiie

A arches. To conform with the design of the Cat.licdi.'al.

the Heinz Chapel is styled in modified Gothic. with the
arches and naves lending a solemnity lo its iiiterior.
