Tri-Weekly

Pre-Exam Holiday
Slated For SFA
Executive Action

University Body To Receive
Resolution For Omission
Of Friday Classes

Editorial Opens Drive

At a ineetiiig‘ of the Executive
committee of SFA ’l.‘uesday plans
will be considered for a pre-exam-
ination holiday, probably to take
effect next scinester, according to
(‘hairnian Leonard Marks. Such
a resolution would then be sub-
mitted to the E:-:ecutive committee

of the Board of Trustees for ap-
proval.
This action followed student ap-

peals for the holiday after a Pitt News
editorial Vvednesday called attention
to the use of such an intermission in
other colleges. Leonard Marks, cliair-
man of the Executive committee of
SFA, will move to seek the holiday at
the meeting Tuesday, and a resolution
will immediately be submitted to Dr.
John G. Bowma.n_ Chancellor of the
University, for the action of the Uni-
versity committee.

If the resolution to be referred to
the Executive committee of the Uni-
versity cannot be carried through in
time to take effect this semester, _it
is understood that the committee will
look upon the plan with favor, and
consider ways in which it can be
ﬁtted into next semesters schedule.

Eﬁorts will be made to have the
holiday take effect next Friday and
thus provide a three-day interval be-
fore the examination period begins
Monday, January 28. A proposed one-
day holiday would not supplant the
regular inter-semester one already
scheduled, but would supplement it.
according to student leaders who
sought the change. If it would be
found necessary to make up this_o_ne
day in order to have the . requisite
number of days in each school term.
the day could be added in June and
September.

Faculty Give Opinions

professor of geology’, lJ01ieV‘€S the PIT’-'
examination holiday would be worth-
while, in that it would enablethe stu-
dent to come to the examination with
a broader view of the entire subject,
rather than that of just the last part
of the work.

Dr. Vvhitford H. Shelton, professor
and chairman of the department of
modern languages, asserted that a
period in which students might regain
the equilibrium necessary to face ex-
aminations should prove helpful. but
believes this time miglit. best be
added in the form of an extended ex-
aniination period.‘ '

“If the student were trained to U56
the time, and not cram or take a va-
cation from his studies,” Miss Helen
P. Rush, assistant dean of women
said, “I am in favor of it."

Theodore W. Biddle, assistant dean
of men, believes the resolution should
be made effective. H-3 said, “I am in
favor of a plan whereby students are
given an op-po.i'tun'ity to relax and pre-
pare for examinations. The present
exam set—up forbids a leasurely prepa-
ration for the ﬁnals.”

Most of the objections to the plan
centered around the time necessary
between semesters for instructors to
plan work for the next semester, and
for the clerical work involved in reg-
istration to be completed. The reso-5
lution as it will be proposed this aft-
ernoon provides for no change in the
three-day inter-semester holiday now
.2:-heduled. It will concern only the
dismissa]. of .classes .following_ those
on Thursday, January 24. The change
would provide the student with three
days in which to prepare for the ﬁnal
examinations.

Minor Judiciary
As Political Toy

Fate Of “Legal Justice” In Hands
Of 300 County Magistrates,
Inquiry Speaker Asserts

The case is heard and the prisoner
is dragged off.
to the district politician.

Magistrate: “Well?” .

Politician: “His old man ran a con-
'pla votes for the other side." ‘

l\'Iagistrate: “Send him up‘."’

Politician. “Yeah, send ’ini up. 
can't have this thing encouraged, yep
know.” i;

There. according to Vvilliam 
Doty, attorney and alumnus of the
University, is a. sample of the “legal

i

of Allegheny county’s 300 inegistrateiis.

Speaking before the Inquiry foriirii
Wednesday, Mr. Doty explained that
magistrates are not required to read
and write and that “seine of them
doii’t.”

A magistrate studying law, accord-
ing to Mr. Doty, is a “miracle.”

"M,ost magistrates,” Mr. Doty said,
"have never seen the inside of a law
book. It is pure luck if we get our
legal rights before a magistrate who
in the first place hasn’t the faintest
idea. of what those rights are."

Branding the present system in Al-
legheny county as one of the “worst,”
Mr. Doty told his audience that one
Pittsburgli magistrate, out of 5,000
cases, made $25,000 and returned just
two decisions for the defendant.

Mr. Doty explained that magistrates
get paid only if the defendant is found
guilty. Costs are assessed and the
‘defendant is jailed if he can’t pro
duce. 1

“Hearing these cases is harder than
sitting on a supreme court bench,”
Mr. Doty declared. “Our best judges
have the easiest job and the magis-
trates the most difficult. Only 10
per cent of the cases are heard in
courts before trained judges.”

Mr. Doty recommended inimediate
elimination of the present magistrate
set-up. This could be done through
amendment to the constitution of an
article in the Metropolitan plan now
being studied ‘bythje city. ' 

Survey Eedcidls p
$43.04 Average
FERA Earnings

A perusal of statistics just issued
by the University FERA oiﬁce reveals
that 633 students were employed by
the FERA during the first four months
of this semester. A restriction limit-
ing the employment of more than 575
at any one time was observed; but
the larger tot.al number is explained
by citing withdrawals and replace-
ments.

The sum disbursed by the University
totals $28,540.80. In October, Novem-
ber, and December the permitted
group earning of $8,625.00 was‘close-
ly approximated. In September, earn-
ings amounted to $2,707.50, because
only one week remaiiied after regis-
tration. “ ' A

The average earning for all stu-
dents employed was $43.04. The aver-
age for students continuously em-
Dloyed throughout the whole period
was $49.65. This fulﬁlls the require-
ment that the average for the school
must not exceed $15 a month per stu-
dent employed. -

The FERA work being done by stu-
dents includes janitorial work in the
school, typing and research work un-
der _t':-iculty and administrative oﬁicers,
aI1d.S0Cia1* work at community houses
in the city. The work is expected to
last until the end of the second semes-
ter, at least.

Close Budgeting
In P a s t Ye a r

The YMCA finished the year 1934
with a. balance of 64 cents, W’. W.
Mendenhall, executive secretary of
the YMCA, reported yesterday.

The total gross income for the year
was $7,187.94 and the total gross ex-

penses $7,187.30. Freshman camp,
pool and billiards, ping pong, candy
a.nd sandwiches, and ice cream

brought in a gross total of $1,643.94.
There was practically no net income
from these items, Mr. Mendenhall de-
clared. The endowment amounted to
$2145. and the Community fund con-
tributed $3,400. The Community fund
contribution was made up of dona-
tions from business men, faculty, and
students.

These ﬁgures were presented to the
Committee of Management of the
YMCA at the monthly meeting this
week. Four members of the commit-
tee whose terms had expired were re-
elected. They are J. G. Quick, regis-
trar, Dr. IV. H. Vvright, associate pro-
fessor of clinical prosthesis; R. C.
Gorham, associate professor of elec-
trical engineering; and C. IV. Riding-
er, Sr.. president of the Alumni Asso-
ciation.

Text Of Letters To Alumni, Parents I

"It is probable that the securing of
an appropriation for the University
next year will meet some opposition.
Education at Pitt should never be a
political issue. It is above all party
interests and policies.

“The alumni of the University want

a good state administration. We can
help to that end. In fact, we can be
one of the most important instru-

ments in Pennsylvania to that end.
We expect, however, fair and just
treatment for Pitt. '

“There are 65,000 alumni and for-
mer students. Let's get together.
Pitt is 147 years old. its traditions
and services are rooted deep and we
should have favorable consideration
from the legislature for our appro-
priation and the support of our
alumni in securing it. Will you
help?”

Both letters are signed by John

W‘. Hallock, secret.ary of the

Alumni association.

Alumni Secretary Prepares
To Distribute Letters
To 97,000 Persons

Ninety-seven thousand parents.
alumni and students are being rallied
today to consider the facts of the
coming state appropriatioii to the
University.

Directed by the General Alumni as-
sociation, a campaign is being insti-
tuted to acquaint these people of the
opposition which may meet the ap-
propi-ia.tion_ at the present session of
the legislature. _

“Should the appropriation be cut,
there is no telling how drastically it
would affect students,” said John ‘W.
Hallock, secretary of the association.

Aided by Don F. Saunders, editor
of The Pittsburgh Record and The
Alumni Review, the association has
worked out a three-part campaign to
notify each of the 97,000 persons in-
volved of facts in the appropriation
drive: '

1—~A series of letters with pertinent
facts concerning developments in the
drive to prevent a cut in the appro-
priation already is being mailed to
21,000 parents and 65,000 alumni, with
11,000 students, an estimated total of
97,000, according to Saunders.

2—A carefully prepared digest of
data will be published in both the
alumni publications‘ which come out
shortly. ‘

3—County committees organized
through Pitt clubs will function
throughout the state as central bu-
reaus of information.

In 1933, the University appropria-
tion was $1,188.000 for the biennium
1933-1935. This was a cut of 10 per
cent under the previous appropriation.
One-third of the funds depended on
the successful passing of Amendment
8, a $25,000,000 bill for charities, hos-
pitals, schools and unemploymeiit re-
lief.

The University’s active support of
this amendinent was its first “en-
trance into politics.” The amendment
was passed, and the state appropria-
tion came through with a 10 per cent
cut.

Faculty Scores Victory
In Bridge Tournament

Winning 72 to 56, 16 members of
the University faculty decisively de-
feated a like number of students in
the duplicate tournament. Tuesday
evening in the Schenley Bridge club
rooms.

The victory reversed the decisions
of the past two years in which the
students had won. The faculty was
elated over the result. Dr. James S.
Taylor, acting head of the mathe-
matics department and co-sponsor
with \Villiams S. Maulsby of the Uni-
versity Bridge club, stated: “I feel
we made out pretty well. Perhaps the
students will want a return matc‘.1.”

clared Rc-presentative Zappala yester-
day. Under the Pinchot administra-
tions it was customary to consider
these grants late in the term, but the
current burden of ﬁnancial problems
facing the legislature may force ap-
propriations well up into the early
part of the session, it was indicated.

House May Ponder

Vvhereas heretofore the House has
ordinarily passed on appropriation
bills to the Senate. where the great-
est discussion of the measures took
place, it is expected that the new
Democratic House will ponder money
hills with unusual care. Bills passed
by both chambers will be sent to Gov-
ernor George Earle, who may ap-
prove appropriations for the exact
ﬁgure determined by the legislature,
or for a. lesser ﬁgure, though he may
not raise the sum.

Mr. Vveber explained yestr-.i‘(lay that
the University is already operating
on a curtailed appropriation. and
e=~inplia.sized that the $l~'.1,188.000 figure
is virtually irreducibl‘e if the Uni-
versity is to maintain its teaching
staff and pay coal, light and other
charges.

I have been encouraged to write
once more the’ sort of column that I
once did for the razz sheet of the Pan-
ther last year. By encouraged, I
mean that someone remarked to me
that after all that particular bit of
nonsense was as near to writing some-
thing good as I ever came. The other
day I discovered the Panther that con-
tained that column, and after reading
it over fondly two or three times, I
believe that the gentleman who on-
couraged me is correct, that I far ex-
ceeded myself, that I shall perhaps
never warm to that divine spark
again. and that maybe I ought to try
and do another like it. But before I
perilous straits
nga.ii1, let me be serious. A most

cutter to have 13 daughters. Every
other woodchopper (Notice how easy
it is to avoid repetition) in the woods
had two sons. The wives of the wood-
cutters talked among themselves
about the unfortunate woman. and
tried to:-guess what she had done to
have such a curse visited upon her.

Now 13 daughters is in itself curse
enough, but these daughters all were
a bit queer. It. was said, quietly of
course, that there had been strange
sights and noises come from the wood-
cutt.er’s cottage on moonlight nights.
Three of them wanted to go. on the
radio, so they had to practice hill-
billying. The other ten wanted to go
to college. They were a no-good lot,
and the poor old man was worried.
He thought that probably the best.
thing to do was to marry them off.
And that was what led to the great
problem. There were, in the neigh-
borhood, only 12 woodcutter’s sons,
which, of course, left one woodcut-
ter's daughter left over.

The poor, puzzled woodcutter didn’t
sleep well nights thinking about this
problem. In fact, he didn't sleep at
all. He thought and thought, trying
to ﬁgure out some way to marry 13
daughters to 12 woodcutter's sons.
He ﬁlled sheet after sheet of birch
bark with small ﬁgures, but he just
could not make it come out right.
And as far as I know he never did
ﬁnd the right answer.—Anyhow, it’s
time now to go to class.

Ten Students Will Study
Conditions In Coal Mines

Ten students of the University, six
men and t'o'3.1‘ women, will take a four-
day trip to the coal ﬁelds of eastern
Ohio to study actual conditions among
miners in the Wlieeling coal district,
W. W. Mendenhall, executive secre-
tary cl‘ the YMCA, announced yester-
day. ‘

Leaving Pittsburgh on .l'anuary 31,
the group will go directly to Neff,
Ohio, near Bellaire, to the mines of
the Hannah Coal company and remain
there until February 3.

While there, the students will stay
at the homes of miners and sec con-
ditions at ﬁrst hand, going down into
the mines and working there side-b_v-
side with the minors. The girls will
work with the women.

F. D. Roosevelt has shown a dex-

A critic writing on a very lib-

‘‘It may be interesting, but is it
poetry?” The question should be
phrased in a slightly different way
to cover a lot of the metrical,
rhymed stuff published recently.
“It may be poetry, but is it inter-

Heywood Broun has married an ex-

Panther Mittmen Open Season Tomorrow With Syracuse

The Pitt News

Page Three

Coach Schricker, Squad Leave
Today For Ring Battles

With Strong Orangemen

Pitt Team Forfeits In

Heavyweight Division;

All Other Weight Classes Filled

 

By Carl R. Sare
Tomorrow evening the Pitt sluggers will take over the job of

boxing Oranges for a couple of hours.

The occupation will not be

quite so easy as one would suppose; it means the Panther mittmen
will be sent into action against the ﬁghters of Syracuse university,

commonly known as the Orange.

The Pitt team will leave the Pennsylvania station tonight at 9

o'clock in order to arrive in Syracuse tomorrow afternoon. The men
will go through a light workout, eat 21%

still-lighter lunch, and then take a
short rest before the ﬁrst of the ﬁst
matches starts.

Much of the tenseness over the
lineup has been removed since Coach
Jack Schricker has announced the
deﬁnite starting men. The seven var-
sity men who will make the trip are
“Michael Sivak, Al Pazlowski, James
Giannatti, Bernard Spiegel, Milton
Golilberg, Charles Gongloff, and Gene
Stoughton. These men have worked
exceptionally hard due to the fact that.
their positions have been threatened
constantly by other squad members.

Michael Sivak, 115-pound sophomore,
will have to prove himself against

lack of Syracuse. The Panther
bantamweight has not had much ex-
perience, but he makes up for this
deﬁciency through cool headwork and
aggressive jabbing. The biggest as-
signment Sivak has is to gain conﬁ-
dence in himself, according to Coach
Schricker.

Al Pazlowski, 125—pound class, will
have to match his left jabs against the
rugged Ben Solomon. If A1 can get
both ﬁsts working he will be a. good
match for his opponent.

All Pitt boxing fans have their eyes
on James Giannatti, 135-pound cap-
tain of the varsity. It was uncertain
for a time whether Jimmy would be
able to meet his man in the opening
match, due to scholastic deﬁciencies.
The breaks were right, Jimmy is in
there, and Coach Schricker is almost
Sure of a 135-pound division victory.

Spiegel Battles Button

Bernard Spiegel, one of therbest
and most experienced collegiate box-
ers in the district, will be up against
1\iichael Button, who fills the vacancy
in the 145-pound class of the New
Yorkers. The University of Pitts-
::urgh’s 155—pound position has been
deﬁnitely annexed by Milton Goldberg,
a strong left-handed hitter and a
formidable man with both mitts.

Of the three varsity football men
expected in the lineup, only two are
present. Arnold Greene, varsity quar-
terback and potential heavyweight on
the boxing team, failed to show up at
practices and consequently the Pan-"
thers will journey to S'racuse minus
a heavyweight contender. Charles
Gongloff, however, will be present to
handle the 165-pound job, and Gene
Stougliton will take on a 175-pound
opponent. .

The entire Pitt squad has cut out
strenuous practices and according to
Schricker there will be no more ex-
hausting work until after the match
on Saturday. The length of rounds
has been cut down slightly and the
amount of rope-skipping increased.
This will tend to save the energy of
the team but will prevent any stiffen-
ing or losing of pace.

After the battle at Syracuse the
team will meet 'Washington and Jef-
r'erson, \Visconsin, Navy, Miami, Tem-
pie, and VVcst Virginia.

Lambda Chi Alpha Scores Upset
Victory Over Phi Gram Five

 

Two tournament records and one
;<r.artling upset stamped Tuesday,
January 8, as the “big” night of the
lnterfraternity bowling tourney thus
far. '

Although outpointed in two out of
three games against Pi Lambda.‘ Phi,
xlie Phi Ep pinmen hung up two new

lnterfrat records. First, Carl Kings-
bacher rolled into the select “200”
class before the team total of the sec-
ond match was completed. Then,
when this 200 combined_ with the to-
tals of four teammates, it was discov-
ered that Phi Delta 'l‘heta’s* 726 high-
ieam record had also been shattered,
by a margin of 26 pins. »

Lambda Chi Alpha scored the upset
over Phi Gamma Delta by taking
three straight from the former run-
ners-up. This victory shoved’-the Phi
Gains out of second place, and placed
the Lambda. Chi’s in a challenging po-
sition.

The ,ﬁrst Pi Lam victory was regis-
tered in the ﬁnal frame. Rosenfield
doubled out to make it look sure for
Phi Epsilon Pi. However, Rosen-
bloom staged a “Merriwell” for the
Pi Lams by tripling out in the ﬁnal
frame with three straight strikes.

As Faculty Bowls
Over The Pins

Winning three out of the four
scheduled games, the Omega faculty
bowling team neared the top in the
faculty bowling league when they met
and defeated the Alpha bowlers last
Monday night at the Center-Neville
bowling alleys.

Throughout the four games the
play was marked by close scores. In
the first game the Omega team showed
its greatest superiority over the Al-
phas, taking the game with the score,
467-415. Ted Biddle led the individual
scorers in this game with a total of
172. The remainder of the match was
extremely close, Omega winning the
second and third games by eight and
23 points, respectively. In the ﬁnal
game, the Alpha team came to life to
win by 30 points.

. Ted Biddle, of the Omega team, led
the scorers with an average score of
125. The Alpha team had the distinc-
tion of having in its ranks the next
two high individual scorers, Franklin
and Rupp. with averages of 123 and
117, respectively.

Dambacli follows the leaders with
an average of 107 while Atkinson is
just one point under the century mark
at the present standings.

The faculty league operates every
Monday night.

team, pulling into town yesterday from
their second Eastern trip, returned
just in time to ﬁnd Mr. George Keo-
gan and his band of Irish basketball
players waiting to meet the Golden
Panthers in their scheduled game that
ﬁnds the Cats and the Ramblers
tangling tomorrow night on the Sta.-
dium ﬂoor.

This season the Ramblers have not
quite been up to their usual standard
in the basketball. world. Of the sev-
en games played Notre Dame has
dropped three of them, losing to
Northwestern, Minnesota and NYU,
while winning from Holy Cross, But-
ler, Marquette and Wisconsin. Even
at that the Irish have a good ball
club and in no way have they lost
their drawing power, packing crowds
of 11,000 and 16,000 in to see them.

Coach George Keogan has built his
varsity this year around Marty Peters
at the pivot post, and Jimmy Ireland
at guard, the only remaining
varsity men from last year’s crack
team. Peters, a regular end on
the Ramblers’ football team, leads
his teammates in the matter of scor-
ing, having averaged ten points per
game in the ﬁrst seven. games.

Newcomers at Forwards

At the forward positions Keogan
has . placed O’Kane, a
star, and Ford, a reserve last sea-
son, in an eifort to replace the high-
scoring team of Moose Krause and
Joe Voegele who were lost through
graduation last -June; Ed Jordan, al-
so a reserve last year, ﬁlls the posi-
tion left vacant by Leo Crowe at the
other guard position. All in all, the
Irish coach has done right well in
the new edition of his cage team,
lacking only the necessary experience
for the team to click together.

Coach Carlson, having somewhat
the same problem as Keogan, plans
to send the same starting lineup
against the ‘Ramblers that was used
in the two recent Eastern trips.

Frosh Play Kiski

In the preliminary to the Panther-
lrish game, the Panther ‘freshmen

sophomore .

team will stack up against a district
rival, Kiski. The preliminary will
begin at 7 o’clock, with the main
game taking the spotlight immediate-
ly after the close of the freshman
game.

The probable starting lineup:

Pitt Pos. Notre Dame

Cagers Over’-whelm Rams

It may be that the Panther cagers
must have a. crowd of 16,000 in the
house before they will put on their
show in genuine fashion. At any rate,
that is just what they did in the sec-
ond pa.rt of a double-header attraction
at Madison Square Garden in New
York VVednesday night. The Rams of

Fordham were the unfortunate fel-
lows who played in the supporting
cast.

Ross Emrick, with 12 points result-
ing from ﬁve ﬁeld goals and two
fouls, led the Panthers in running up
a total of 43 while the Rams were get-
ting 20 in all. Skip Hughes, showing
again his old foul-shooting form,
counted ﬁve free throws and three
ﬁeld goals to take the runner-up hon-
ors in scori.ng with 11 points.

From the time Emrick dropped in
two foul shots after being fouled in
theﬁrst minute of play, the Panthers
were never in trouble. Every man in
the lineup figured in the Pitt scoring
while the class of the passing attack
bewildered the spectators and, inci-
dently, the Rams.

Heavy Schedule Confronts
Swimmers This Week-End

Five Panthers Entered In AMA Meet Tonight; Face Tech
Tartans Tomorrow At Metropolitan Club

 

The varsity swimming team is in line for another week-end of
tough competition in the form of two swimming meets in as many

days.

Tonight ﬁve members of the Panther varsity will swim in an

Allegheny Mountain Association meet and tomorrow night the entire
varsity squad will line up against the Tech Tartans at 8 o’clock in
the Metropolitan Club, corner of Third a11d ‘Wood streets. There

will be no admission charge.

Coach Corr has entered only ﬁve¢

varsity swimmers in the two events
for men in the AMA meet which will
take place at the Pittsburgh Athletic
Association club tonight‘~at 8‘o’clock.
Captain Jack Denny and Russell Lind-
berg have been entered in the 220-
yard freestyle senior championship
event, and Joe J ones, I/Villiam Swazuk,
and John Stiranka have been entered
in the 100-yard backstroke scratch
race.

Two women's events, a 100 and a 50-
yard freestyle race, will complete the
PAA swimming program. Both wo1n-
en’s events are scratch races.

Inasmuch as it is the first meet for
the Tartans not much is known of
their strengtli. Their best bet in the
backstroke and 220—yard freestyle
events, Bill Holliday, is reported to be
on the disabled list, which is a con-
siderable blow to the Tartan hopes.
However, there are plenty of worthy
svimmers left on their team from
last year, plus a number of freshmen
that, will, come in mighty handy in
bringing home a few points for the
Tech cause. Franke, Leavitt, and Von
Der Lancken head the list of veterans.
Coming up from the freshman team
Coach Reisdorph can count on Ham-
merschmidt, Mosena and Nagin.

Coach Corr plans to enter approxi-
mately the same lineup that he sent
against the University of Delaware
last Saturday night. The only change
Corr is contemplating, is placing Joe
Jones in the 440-yard freestyle race in
place of ‘William Lewis, and placing
Lewis in the relay in Jone’s vacated
position.

Tentative varsity lineup:

50-Yard Freestyle

Williain Ruhe, Joseph Madden.

220-Yard Freestyle

Jack Denny, William Lewis.

Diving
Harry Geyer, George Myers.
440-Yard Freestyle

Research Group
To Make Survey

Questionnaires Will Investigate
Students’ Cultural Tastes

   

A survey will soon ' be conducted
among 60 freshman and senior women
to ﬁnd out if they are taking advan-
tage of the cultural opportunities of
the University and Pittsburgh organ-
izations while at the University.

This survey, the work of the Re-
search committee of VVSGA under the
chairmanship of Agnes Calabrese,
Ed35, assisted by Carrie Huffman,
Ed35, will be in the form of a ques-
tionnaire. Thestudents will be asked
what concerts, plays, lectures or exhi-
bitions they have attended as stu-
dents of the University, why they did
not attend others, and what type they
prefer. A special group of questions
for freshmen will ask what they at-
tended while in high school.

Miss Calabrese said yesterday, “We
want this to be a survey of things
students have attended. Besides be-
ing an indication of how much the
average student attends, it will be an
indication of the growth (or decline)
of interest in cultural activities.”

VVomen students who will partici-
pate in this survey will be selected at
random from the ﬁles at Heinz House,
the only reqiiirement being that they
attended school last semester, either
university, college, or high school.

The report of the committee will be
published after the results of the
questionnaif'°e- have been compiled.

To War Conclave

Miss Battrick To Attend Tenth
Annual Conference Next
Week At Washington

Miss Helen C. Battrick, executive
YVVCA secretary, has been selected
by the Pittsburgh chapter, American
Association of University ‘Women, to
be their delegate to the tenth annual
Conference on the Cause and Cure of
VVar.

The conference will be held in the
Hall of Nations, Washington, D. 
from Tuesday to Friday of next week.

The general objectives of the con-
ference on the Cause and Cure of VVar
are to build effective peace machinery,
to reduce.war.mach.iner.,v, and to ob-
tain guaranteed security against war
for every nation.

The program will analyze the cost
of peace, and what is involved in fac-
ing and accepting it. A review of
“The world today,” and an interpreta-
tion of events according to their iii-
ﬂuence for peace or for war, as well
as consideration of the new dangers
of war, will be brought to the atten-
tion of the delegates.

Mrs. Franklin D. Roosevelt will be
the principal speaker at the confer-
ence banquet on Tuesday evening,
and later in the week the White
House will give :1 reception for the
Senator Gerald P. Nye
of N01-G1 Dakota, the main speaker
on W'edne.sday evening, will discuss
the arms control situation.

Following the national conference
at Wzishington, regional two-day
meetings will be held in ten cities.

“The greatesiﬁ problem of this
century,” according to Carrie Chap-
man Catt, who issued the call for the
meeting, “is how to avoid the threat-
ened ‘next war’ and its aftermath-
the war depression. Many think the
depression is a more severe shock to
a nation than the war that caused it.
The wa.y can and will be found,” she
continued, "wnen the people cease to
be afraid to think.”

Chairman Clides
From Oil Field
To Dance Floor

It's a long jump, and certainly not a
terrifying one, from driving a ﬁre en-
gine in the dangerous oil ﬁelds of Cal-
ifornia to leading the grand march of
a formal dance.

Mel Carna.han, BA35, chairman of
the lnterfraternity Ball Friday night,
should have no trouble finding his
way as he leads the patrons through
the intricate twists and turns of the
march at 10:15 o’clock, for Mel has
certainly “been around.”

After graduating from Kitta.nning
high school back in 1923, Carnahan
did a. bit of automobile selling, dab-
bled in credit investigations, headed
for Chicago where he worked for an
electrical ﬁrm, and then pulled stakes
for California. '

Three years in the oil fields, where
serious accidents were numerous,
where high salaried experts and low-
wage laborers worked side by side in
the midst of massive machinery step-
ped up to immense pressure, were
vastly different from the not quite so
harrowing years in the life of a col-
lege student, he admitted.

Ashort stay in Dallas, Texas, a.nd
then to the University to get some
more “la.rnin” sums up Carnahan’s
biography to date.
