By fall students may be charging with Pitt ID cards

By Matt Groff
Asst. News Editor

If the current plans stay on track, a
year from now students may be able to
handle all of their daily ﬁnancial activi-
ties by just pulling out their student iden-
tification card.

“It has been a goal of the Student
Government Board for students to have
an alternative to carrying cash around

Diggin’ in the dirt 

Oakland,” board member Heath Golden
said.

According to Golden, Special Teams,
Inc. recently gave an extensive presenta-
tion on how Pitt could set up a system
where student identification cards would
be used as credit cards at various Pitt-
affiliated and other local establishments.
He said representatives from the Office
of Student Activities, Food Services, the
Book Center and the Student Health

Service also attended the presentation.
Golden said at this point it is highly
likely that this fall students will be able
to put a credit account on their ID cards
which will be immediately accepted at
the Pitt bookstore and pharmacy, as well
as eventually branching out into other
areas. Golden said the Yellow Cab Co.,
which has recently installed credit card
machines, has already said they only
need a minor software modification in

University
announces
it will not
be involved
in telescope

Byjohn B. Moore
Staﬂ Writer

After a day of protest and a City
Council resolution stating objec-
tions to the University of
Pittsburgh’s involvement in the Mt.
Graham telescope project, the
University has announced it is not
involved with the project, accord-
ing to Josh Knauer, a Mt. Graham
Coalition activist.

Pitt announced over a year ago
that it was considering involve-
ment with the University of
Arizona on the Mt. Graham project.

Opponents to the project said
the location of the telescope, about
100 miles northeast of Tucson, is
home to the endangered Mount
Graham red squirrel and a sacred
site for the San Carlos Apaches.

Knauer said, “The assistant to Pitt
Chancellor J. Dennis O’Connor
announced  [the university] is
not involved in the Mt. Graham
Project, and I have no reason to
believe it is considering involve-
ment.”

E—mail harassers face
severe consequences

By Laura Zotis
Staff Writer

Aiming to “keep high
achievers high achievers,”
Pitt’s Investing Now program
offers academic support in
math and science to local
high school students.

Started in 1988 by a group
of men including Jake
Milliones, the former presi-
dent of the Pittsburgh school
board, the program strives to
aid African-American students
in their studies.

Although started as a multi-
university venture including
Carnegie Mellon University

and Duquesne University, the
program is based at Pitt and is
housed at the school of engi-
neering, Benedum Hall.

Director of Investing Now
Leslie Horne said the program
not only involves students but
their parents as well. She has
been with the organization
since its inception in 1988
and said the program is in
partnership with the
Pittsburgh public school sys-
tem to help the high school
students.

“We regularly receive grade
reports from the schools so
that we can monitor [the stu-
dents’l achievements,” said

Home. “We look for better
than a 3.0 in their overall
QPAs, but specifically a 3.0 is
needed in Math and Science.
This is not a remedial pro-
gram.”

“Early on in the program,
we had a saying, ‘Keep high
achievers high achievers.’
This remains to be our focus
today,” Home said.

The program is year-round.
During the school year, stu-
dents participate in work-
shops and seminars in college
planning and goal setting in
the evenings and on the
weekends.

Abusers of Pitt’s computer sys-
tem are subject to the same
action as any student who has
judicial board complaints filed
against them, according to repre-
sentatives from Pitt’s Department
of Judicial Affairs and Computing
and Information Sciences.

Many abusers, most of whom
are caught sending harassing or
offensive e-mail to unsuspecting
recipients, stop after their first
offense and a waming from CIS.

However, serious and repeat
offenders can be tried in front of
Pitt’s Judicial Board, according to
Sue Geisler of Judicial Affairs.

Sanctions taken against offen-
sive e-mail can range from disci-
plinary reprirnands to dismissa
from the university, depending
on the severity of the offensive
messages.

“Once a complaint is filed, we
follow our normal procedure,’
Geisler said. “We don’t recom-
mend the sanctions, the com-
plainant recommends them.”

Geisler said two students have
had their accounts suspendec
thus far, and though no one ha:
been dismissed from Pitt yet, it i-
a possibility.

Spring brings ﬂowers, sports-related injuries

By Lauren Gavlak
For The Pitt News

It has been a long winter, and now that
students be can be outside without thermal
underwear, the desire to do something ath-
letic in the great outdoors overcomes a lot
of people.

There is nothing wrong with enjoying
these early spring days with a little exercise,
as long as students do not overdo it.

Spring is not only for daisies and blue
skies, it’s also a time for sports injuries.

According to the University of
Pittsburgh’s Center for Sports Medicine,
there are more sports-related injures at this
time of the year than at any other. They
say sports-related injuries most often oc-
cur when the athlete does not take the
precautionary measures to avoid an in-
jury.

The Center for Sports Medicine suggests
two easy steps students can take to keep
injury-free this spring.

First, if students have not been exercising
all winter, they should take it easy the first
few times getting on that bike or going for a
run.

Second, students should always warm up

muscles with at least 10 minutes of aerobic
exercise. This can be walking, riding a sta-
tionary bike or swimming.

After that add five minutes of stretching
exercises.

Warm muscles are easier to stretch and
less likely to strain. This type of complete
body warm-up can save students from
doing permanent and painful damage to
muscles.

“Even though sometimes I just can’t
wait to get started on my run, I always
stretch out for at least 10 minutes. The
one time I didn’t do it, I ended up pulling
a muscle and I couldn’t run for two
weeks anyway. I learned that lesson
the hard way,” said Pitt senior Beth Jen-
kins.

Not only does the springtime weather
entice many amateur sports enthusiasts, but
so do the many city and community run-
ning events.

According to sports medicine experts, if
students are running in a marathon for the
first time, or if they have not been in a seri-
ous training program in a while, it is a good
idea to attend a running clinic. Clinics are
offered by many area hospitals and univer-
sity sports programs.

Researchers
recruit for
menopause,
heart study

By Linda D. Howard
For The Pitt News

Researchers at the University
of Pittsburgh and West Penn
Hospital are recruiting women
for a study designed to deter-
mine the impact of hormone
replacement therapy in post-
menopausal women with heart

disease.

The Heart and Estrogen—prog—
estin Replacement Study will
"test whether estrogen and prog-
estin will reduce the occurrence
of heart disease in women with

a history of cardiac problems.

Dr. Jane Cauley, principal
investigator, said, “The study is
very important because the
estrogen question is a big ques-
tion for women. More informa-
tion about the positives and
negatives of estrogen is needed

Frerzcb professor says Pittsburgh, Gerzez/or czlilee

Staﬂ‘ Writer
Although Geneva,

Switzerland, and Pittsburgh
aren’t often thought of as
neighbor cities, Pitt professor
Yves Citton says they have
more in common than one
might think.

Citton, who received his
Ph.D. in French 18th century
literature from the University
of Geneva in Geneva,
Switzerland, has been teach-
ing French at Pitt for a year
and a half.

Pittsburgh is “not too far
from a European city,” the 31-
year-old professor said. The
people here are “really warm
and full of faith.”

Although the people are
warm and friendly, the city is
not without problems.

Citton said he believes
the problems
past are still present in to-
day’s society, which makes
teaching even more enjoy-

from the

able.

Because of the different
problems present in American
society, teaching varies some-
what between Pittsburgh and
Geneva.

Citton’s teaching experi-
ences here differ from
Switzerland in that “teaching
is more challenging here.
Students are more open and
Critics.”

Critical students are not
negative, according to Cit-
ton.

“lCriticism by students]
proves that what you’re teach-
ing is valuable.”

Swiss society also differs
from American society
because “in Switzerland the
state pays for the students’
education at college.”

Everybody has the feeling
“of being pan of a community
[the poor, wealthy, etcl.”

The Pitt faculty also make
the environment much more
pleasant to teach in.

Citton said, “The faculty are

very supportive and make it

a good atmosphere to work.

in.”

Although 18th century liter-
ature courses may seem to be
no more than an old way of
thinking that is no longer use-
ful, Citton disagrees.

“lnvesting in teaching litera-
ture pushes you to find
meaning by reading. In our
society the word ‘kill’ linguisti-
cally has no meaning,” he
said. “Society is going back
towards the time of the Dark
Ages.”

Citton doesn’t limit himself
teaching French in the
Cathedral of Learning. During
his spare time he enjoys vol-
unteering his time to teach at
a prison in the North Side.

He teaches a political theory
class to the prisoners.

Students “bring their own
culture and experiences to the
classroom  the students are
very bright and anxious to
learn.”

The students are not the

only ones who gain from the
experience, the professor
does as well, according to
Citton.

“More Pitt faculty should
volunteer their time there. It
makes themselves feel better
[that they’re helping someone
e1sel.”

Along with teaching at
the prison, Citton fills his per-
sonal life with his interest in
music.

Concerts here are similar
to “a communal celebration,”
according to Citton who
attended the Bad Brains con-
cert a few weeks ago.

He said he and his wife also
enjoy attending various jazz
concerts in the area.

Citton is relatively new to
Pitt, and he has no plans of
leaving in the near future.

According to Citton, his
goals for the future are “to stay
at Pitt and to try and make
a difference; to try and
show people what w.ords
mean.”

when studying heart disease.”

Janet Bonk, recruitment coor-
dinator for Pitt’s Department of
Epidemiology, said, “Most
research done in the past was
done with males. There is a
great need of studies for
women.”

The study will take place at
the University of Pittsburgh and
West Penn Hospital and will
involve three screening visits to
further determine eligibility.
The study is looking for post-
menopausal women under age
80 with documented coronary
heart disease, such as a heart
attack, cardiac bypass, angio-
plasty or severe blockage on
cardiac catheterization.
Participants cannot have had a
hysterectomy.

During the five-year study,
participants will be examined

Birman, a junior economics
major who won $5,900 in
cash.

From 137 students, the field
was narrowed to 36 by a writ-
ten test and then to the final
four by a mock version of the
popular game show.

In early March, students
were wisked away to sunny
Orlando, Fla., home of
Disneyworld and MGM stu-
dios for the taping of “College
Week.”

Airfare, meals and deluxe
accomodations at the Buena

tary to all the contestants.

“I wasn’t nervous at all.
Everybody was really nice to
us. Pat and Vanna are really
down-to-earth people,” said
Andrea Snyder, who won sec-
ond place and $3,550 in cash.

“I watch‘ all the time now,
just to see if I can solve the

May 16, when they will face
students from the University

THE PITI‘ NEWS, Thursday, April 7, 1994

E-mail

Continued from page 1

plaints about offensive e-mail
are reviewed individually, and
sanctions against abusers are
based on how serious their
offense is.

“In the case where someone
gets a message they didn’t like
and there are just some obsceni-
ties in it, they might get a light
sentence,” Schatz said. “If [a
message] is significantly damag-
ing to the university’s reputation,
it could be a very heavy sen-
tence.”

In an interview with T be Pitt
News last week, Schatz said the
number of e-mail offenses has
increased from less than 10 per
month to several dozen each
month. Schatz said Academic
Computing has seen live exam-
ples of offensive e-mail since
April 1.

‘Pitt Director of Academic
Computing Dan Temple said the
recent increase in violations may
be due to an overall increase in
students’ use of the network.

“Now we have about 28,000
student accounts, and we have
the complete spectrum of the
student body using the comput-
ers, so the number of these
problem cases is larger,” Temple
said.

“Proportionately, the problem
may be no larger [than before],
but proportions don’t help us
because we have to deal with
the problems one—at-a—time,” he
said.

Schatz and Temple said
though CIS responds to all com-
plaints it receives, it never goes
out of its way searching for sys-
tem abusers. Use of Pitt’s com-
puting services is governed by

Graham

Continued from page 1

Pitt is one of many universi-
ties opting not to get involved
with the Mt. Graham project.

“The University of Arizona
has admitted they do not
have the funds to complete
their third telescope,” said
Knauer.

Cyril Hazard, a Pitt astronomy
professor, said, “It seems to me
that there’s a lot of misunder-
standing about [the project].”

The university never invested
money, and the astronomy
department never set forth spe-

ciﬁc proposals, only recommen-
dations, according to Hazard.

Hazard said the university has
not given up its quest to ﬁnd a
telescope to invest in. “We have
given our opinions [on other
projects], but there will be no
movement in the near future.”

Commenting on the universi-
ty's decision not to invest in the
Mt. Graham project, Pitt student
Matt Peters said “I have lived
here for over 10 years, and I am
a student at the university. I am
glad to see Pitt made such a
wise decision.”

the university’s Student Code of
Conduct, which Temple says is
based on common sense.

“The code is not there so we
can look over everybody’s
shoulder  students have to go
out of their way to get in trou-
ble,” Temple said.

“We don’t go out looking for
anything,” Schatz said. “We’re
not ‘Big Brother.”

Before students receive a com-
puter authorization account,
they must fill out a form in
which they agree to use the
computers for academic or
research purposes only.

However, Geisler said abuses
of the e-mail network can arise
when students do not pay atten-
tion to the agreement.

“A lot of times, students will
tell us ‘we didn’t read that state-
ment before we signed it,”’
Geisler said. “Before you sign
your name to something, you

have to read it.

“Students often feel they have
the right to use [the system] for

any purpose they wish, and that
often includes harassment o
others.” ‘

According to Geisler, inci-
dences of offensive e-mail could
be prevented if students realized
the purpose of Pitt’s computing
system.

“Students sometimes fail to
[understand] that the university’s
computer system is here to sup-
plement their education,” she
said. “Tying up the computer
with that type of [illegal] activity
often involves denying other stu-
dents their right to use the sys-
tem.”

Geisler said another e-mail
problem is students lending their
computer account to others,
thereby allowing the other peo-
ple to send messages in the
account owner’s name.

“You wouldn’t give out your
Visa card number or long-dis-
tance access code to somebody,
so why would you want to give
out your computer account?”
Geisler said. “You’re responsible

_____.?._....._...__.__.2

for what is sent from your
account, and it doesn’t matter
whether you knew what [the
other person’s] intent was.”

In addition to violating the
conduct code, Temple said using
Pitt’s computers for non-acade-
mic purposes is a ‘waste of
money, since students must pay
a computing fee each semester.

“This really is an abuse of the
computing fee,” Temple said.
“It’s just like going into a class-
room and tearing up the black-
boards.” .

Schatz and Geisler said inap-

propriate e-mail is a problem"

which faces many universities,
not just Pitt. “This is not just a Pitt
problem,” Geisler said. “It’s a
problem that’s a growing con-
cern at most colleges and univer-
sities right now.”

According to Schatz, approxi-
mately 28,000 members of the

Pitt community own computer“

authorization accounts. He said
CIS has received 171 complaints
since January 1993.

IDs

Continued from page I
nect with a system which
offers us the most'features.”

Conte said he believes once
a system is installed, students
may be able to operate resi-
dence hall washers, dryers
and vending machines using
their ID cards.

SGB Advisor Joyce
Giangarlo said she was con-
cerned about the credit card-
like magnetic strip which
would be on the new cards.

“It seems the cards will con-
tain a bar code [which Pitt
machines already read for
meal plans, choice dollars,
etc] in addition to having the
magnetic strip,” Giangarlo
said. “As long as the card has
both, we’ll be all right.”

According to Golden, the
cards would be similar to the
existing ones except for a
magnetic strip on the back in
addition to the bar code.

Giangarlo said she was also
interested in how the cards
might affect SGB elections.

According to Golden, poll
workers could scan the cards
to “lock out” people after they
have voted once.

Terry Milani, assistant direc-
tor of Student Activities, said
he sees various advantages to
new ID cards and expects
they will be accepted for pay-
ment at the ticket office and
the Concourse service center
in the William Pitt Union. He
said he was also interested in
the compilation abilities of the
software which may be used.

“When a card is scanned,
the software uses electronic
means to gather the data
about the person,” Milani said.
“We can find out who’s
attending programs and judge
the effectiveness of what we
do.”

According to Golden, the
data will show who is buying
certain items, as well as statis-
tics such as which meals are
the most popular.

Both Golden and Conte said
Director of Food Services

Betsy Sallade—Farina has been
instrumental in pushing the ID
process forward. She could
not be reached yesterday for
comment.

Conte said the possible tran-
sition from the current cards to
the new ones will be a large
undertaking.

“Anytime you try to convert
the cards of 40,000 to 50,000
students and faculty here and
at regional campuses you
must realize it will take time,”
Conte said. “Also, there is the
question of funding for such a
project.”

Giangarlo said another posi-
tive aspect of this system
would be its ability to use
machines which Pitt already
owns. “We could use our
machines with different soft-
ware,” Giangarlo said. “We
could save the expense of
replacing the ones we already
own for bar codes.”

Conte emphasized the com-
mittee is seriously investigat-
ing the issue, -but nothing final

has been decided yet.
Director of the Office of
Residence Life jo Ann

Woodson said she is con-
cerned about the possible use
in the future of the ID cards
for access to the residence
halls.

“The issue of replacement
ID cards must be addressed,"
Woodson said. “I’ve heard
there may be a 24-hour center
for replacement ID’s, and then
there would be no problem.
Many lI.D. cards] are lost
everyday and there needs to
be a quick replacement if the
cards are going to be this
important.”

Giangarlo said students will
need to be careful if the plan
is accepted and student ID
cards take on the characteris-
tics of credit cards.

“Part of being cashless is not
knowing how much money
you actually have,” Giangarlo
said. “That’s a concern for
people who don’t responsibly
keep track of their money.”

Enter the forum

After last Friday’s brawl in front of the William Pitt
Union, nearly everyone agreed that something had to
be done about the response of the police officers
involved. Police officers were accused of using exces-
sive force in trying to contain the trouble, and there
were allegations that the officers’ behavior was, in part,
racially motivated. This issue must not be allowed to
slide out of the attention of the student body. Students’
rights were violated, and this is an issue which has an
effect on everyone who attends or works at Pitt.Because
of the relevance to everyone on campus, attendance
should be high at a public forum which is to be held
today at 8:50 p.m. The Black Action Society and the
National Society of Black Engineers have gotten repre-
sentatives from Campus Police, Pittsburgh City Police
and the administration of the university to sit on a reac-
tion panel. The forum will be held in the Benedum
auditorium in the engineering building.

This is the student body’s chance to find out what
happened and to support their fellow students who
have suffered abusive treatment. Everyone who has an
interest in the quality of life on this campus should
attend. In addition, fraternities, sororities and gover-
nance groups should have representatives in attendance
so that if this issue crosses their paths when they are
planning their next event, they" can be better prepared
to avoid ugly incidents.

Films will aid economic recovery

The city of Pittsburgh has a chance to make an invest-
ment that will pay handsomely. Pittsburgh is a popular
place for filmmakers to practice their craft. Earlier this
year, for example, Peter Falk made an appearance on
the Pitt campus in order to film part of an upcoming
film. The Pittsburgh Film Office, which finds locations
for filmmakers to utilize, could receive 5 percent of
Allegheny County’s hotel room tax, in legislation spon-
sored by state representative Ralph Kaiser. This would
allow it to expand its operations, according to the
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. Three percent of the budget
would bring the film office up to $300,000. Since they
have been living essentially hand-to-mouth, this would
greatly expand their ability to operate. Films that are
coordinated by the office funnel millions of dollars into
the local economy and help the city. Kaiser said we
must alter our thinking about economic growth and not
focus so much on manufacturing as an indicator of eco-
nomic health (Pittsburgh Post—Gazette). As the United
States moves into what has been called a “post-industri-
al era,” cities should look into programs such as this
which help to develop their economies and raise the
quality of life for their residents. The state legislators
should allow this plan to go through. The returns far
outweigh the start-up costs.

Has Greek Week lost its meaning?

What is the purpose of Greek
Week, I ask myself?

Of course, the response I
hope to hear is to raise money
for Special Olympics through
friendly competition amongst
fraternities and sororities.

All right, that doesn’t seem
too complicated. This year’s
Greek Week for me was
extremely disappointing, but at
least the children didn’t suffer
because we raised so much
money.

I am appalled by the way a
lot of college students conduct-
ed themselves, when so many
people put in so much work.

I’d like to remind people it’s
not just the organizers that put
in all the work, it’s the little
people as well.

The sub-committee chairs,
the individual fraternity repre-
sentatives and the brothers and
sisters who canned in the
streets.

Competition is good if it is
done on good terms.

I'd like to tell all the other fra-
ternities and sororities that
didn’t win at events like Greek
Sing that I saw all the acts, and
you shouldn’t need a trophy to
know that you were good.

Many fraternities and sorori-
ties put countless hours of work
into their performances, and if
the judges overlooked you,

most other people in the audi-
ence didn’t.

A trophy signifies what a few
judges thought of perfor-
mances, but the real judges
were everybody in the audi-
ence.

Some people were disap-
pointed with the amount of
money we raised.

Although, I think most people
would agree that $102,000 isn’t
that bad.
In fact, this is $8,000 more
than we raised last year.

Marc
Miller

Well, I think that increase in"

money raised is great.

It goes to show ALL of the fra-
ternities and sororities at Pitt
worked hard.

If some houses didn’t collect
as much as others, maybe the
fraternity or sorority has other
charities it contributes to as
well.

I think through all this com-
petition and hard work, the true
purpose of Greek Week is

being lost.

The children are the impor-
tant thing, not petty feuds
amongst fraternities and sorori-
ties.

It’s good to have pride in
your fraternity or sorority, but
not so much so that you over-
look the purpose of a fraternity
or sorority.

I saw a lot of anger come out
of this, and not enough pride
that the Greeks raised money to
help an organization better its
facilities.

Greek Week 1994 will not go
down as a failure in my eyes.

I thought it was great that
everybody participated and put
in their all.

Playing fair is the name of the
game, and I would hope that
everybody played fairly.

After all it’s not whether you
win or lose but how you play
the game, right?

I’d like to end by congratulat-
ing everybody.

If you got first, second, third,
fourth or fifth place, congratula-
tions.

If not, you won anyway
because you put in a lot of
work.

Next year, let’s hope we can
end Greek Week with less ani-
mosity.

dent

Letter to the Editor

Alan G. Michael, II’s article in The Pitt News
(March 31) compared health care to any other
product, such as toaster ovens or vacuum clean-
ers. There is a large difference.

Medical care is necessary for survival; it is akin
to food. The government does not deny food to
the starving.

If there was mass famine and farmers were
hoarding their surplus or selling it at a higher
price than people could afford, it would be trai-
torous and the government would intervene.
What is the difference between this and the cur-
rent health care situation?

There is an enormous portion of the popula-
tion that cannot afford to go to the dentist or
doctor.

And yes, these are hard—working people; the
only difference between “us” and “them” is we

college students happen to be lucky enough to
have the means to go to college.

Blaming the victims for not having enough
money for medical treatment is backwards and
wrong.

The current health care system denies treat-
ment and pharmaceuticals to the needy for the
sake of profits.

Excusing this justifies slavery of another sort —
it dooms many to slavery to the doctors and drug
companies.

If you can’t pay the bill, you will get very ill
and all your teeth will rot out. This is fair?

There must be a better way.

Market-based health care only solves the doc-
tors’ problem of ﬁnancing their mansions.

Etgbt teams
compete in
Pitt LAX
s/oootout

By Adam Pincus
Staﬂ’ Writer

This weekend will definitely
be an exciting one for the Pitt
men’s lacrosse team as it co-
hosts the Pittsburgh Lacrosse
Shootout, which opens up this
Friday night, with CMU.

There will be eight other
teams competing in the tourna-
ment, and they are Penn State,
West Virginia, Virginia Tech,
University of Buffalo,
Shippensburg, the Pittsburgh
Lacrosse Club, Loyola (Md) and
Nazareth.

The tournament will be set up
to consist of two separate brack-
ets. Points will be awarded to
teams for winning each quarter,
each half and also for winning
the game.

The Panthers have been get-
ting ready for this weekend
since the season began. They
should qualify for the A bracket
and could possibly win the
whole tournament.

“Five out of 10 of the teams
could possibly win the tourna-
ment,” Jeff Shaner said.

“This year is the best competi-
tion this tournament has ever
had, and we think we really
have a good shot at winning it
all.”

“This is definitely the best
team‘ we have ever had, and it
will be really, really tough com-

petition to measure ourselves 3’

against,” Pitt defender Luke Fox
said.

:\‘Iarc Ribot is one of the most it|ost'nci‘;itic guitar pla_\'-
ers to c\'er pick up the instrument. His style is hard to
put into words: they don't seem to have enough c|iar.ic—
ter.. He had an interesting description in the November
1990 .IllI.\‘iL'I'(H1. " Oh God. I sound like garba_L:e. ;\ly
equipment is garbage. I collect garbage. If other peo-
ple want to sound like g;ti‘l1:ree they should imitate me."
_Iourna|ists like terms like ";i\'ant-ja'/.'/". "no'—wa\'e". or
"skronk", but these words imply other musicians. and
are quite generic. Ribot told (illilurI’/river(No\'ember
I990) ." :\“I_\' basic extended technique is disemboodied
rage." And rage he does.

His signature tone is unmismkeable. '.\iet;illic' is an
appropriate adjective; _it cuts. and slices like a (jinsu.
His sound stlurs through arpeggios. stutters through
dischordant melodies. and btirts with chaotic
miise/feedback all in the same song.

ARibot's unique style can not be addressed without a
glance his past alltiliations. He studied with the Hatian
classical guitaristcomposer Frant’/. Cassetis. and later
joined the Realtones. a band that backed sotil artists like
\‘(/ilson Picket, and rocker Chuck Berry when they came
to NYC. His classical technique is featured on "After
the Fall," from Elvis (Costello's .Il1'g/J1 [,1'lee A /(use. and his
experience with the Realtones helped further develop
his driving, rythmie style.

Hecomped with the Lounge Li’/.ards for live years and
three albulms. His love, and study of Eric l)olphy‘s
music was combined with the twisted ja'/.‘/.1 sensability of
the New York outfit. Tom \‘(/aits made Ribot a llixture in I

)'(:‘(H‘.\‘. am/1;1;q ’l'imc'. a live concert Video. The song
"Clap Hands" (form /«am I)qqs) contains one the most,
intense solos Ribot or anyone has offered. Elvis
Costello was quick to recuit Ribot for two albulms. as
was Marriane Faithful for her album. 0’/11.:-'1'I1g .4u'u_t".

Ribot has also recorded with the ‘I11’/I/. passengers three
times, recorded with Syd Straw. john Zorn. The
Ambitious Lovers,F.van Lurie, and’ Allen Ginsberg. The
list goes on and on.

Ribot doesn't just play second fiddle to the stars; he

Whattup yo? Blakk Steel’s in
effidect once again. Since The
Pitt News computer system
“crashed,” I can’t re—call on any
of my old shizznizz; I usually
vibe off of what I did the week
before so I can hit y’all off with
some different ﬂavor. I’ll man-
age. Before I represent with
some of the unreleased ﬂavors,
I want to congratulate the neo-
phytes of Delta Sigma Theta for
officially joining the organiza-
tion Friday. On a sadder note, I
hope Allah takes good care of
you; those that knew her will
miss her. Let’s do this.

Artist: The Beatnuts
Album: ?Fluid?
_Producer(s): artist

THE PITI‘ NEWS Thursda

label: Relativity
rating: @@@@

I’m not sure about the title of
the album, but when it comes
to this group, there are a few
things I’m sure of. I’m sure that
they’ll catch much wrek on this
album, since they caught
underground wrek on their
debut EP, Intoxicated
Demons. I’m sure the tracks
will pound in the jeeps. I’m
sure that Junkyard Juju,
Psycho Les and Cool Ass
Fashion will represent Corona,
Queens to the fullest. (Thanx to
DT for tellin’ me where Corona
is.)

This 17-track album will defi-
nitely be one of the phattest of
‘94. With an ample supply of
rugged jazz tracks, the Beatnuts
come with a variety of lyrical
flavors. Juju is the gangster,
Fash is the horniest and Les is

.. Les! With the first single,
“Props Over Here” (not slated
for release until next week),
they get biz over a pounding

jazz drum track that almost
sounds live in nature, but that’s
the flavor of the album. In
“Straight Jacket,” the ODB’s
part (read: Ol’ Dirty Bastard,
Wu Tang Clan) from “Da
Mystery Of Chessboxin‘“ for
the chorus. “2»3 Break”
reminds you of the GangS_tarr
posse cuts “I’m The Man &
Speak Ya Clout,” whereas
every person has their own
track; JuJu’s track is the hard-
est. “Riks Joint” is some ole
smooth jazz cafe-type shizz
with a rugged drum track and
rhymes to match. “Psycho
Dwarf” is the only old track on
the album. The most obese
tracks on the album are “Fried
Chicken,” “Are You Ready”
and “SuperBad.” In “Fried
Chicken,” The Beatnuts take a
James Brown kick and snare
and create a totally new break-
beat out of it; watch for rappers
sampling that. “Are You
Ready” has the  Demons
teaming up with Grand Puba
to make for a posse jam to
remember. “SuperBad” is just
that; superbadll

The album overall is almost
airtight except for a few air
bubbles. One, Les and Fashion
don’t always carry their weight
lyrically; I’Ve found myself
waiting on Juju to clean up
most of the time. Two, “Lick
The Pu“y” is crazy wack. They
should’ve left this one alone
and brought back “Reign of
The Tec.” Finally, the remix for
Props... entitled “Yeah You
Get Props” should have
remained a B-side on the sin-
gle, not placed on the album.
Not that it’s wack, but the feel-
ing that you just heard this
song is not a good feeling
when you spend your loot.

The album is phat, but don’t
go running to the record store
just yet; it’s not scheduled for
release until the summer. What
I have is a very early promo-

tional. The single should drop‘

next week, then you can get
your props up!

Artist: Terminator X & The
Godfathers Of Threatt

Album: Super Bad
Producer(s): Terminator X
label: P.R.O. Division/ RAL
rating: @@@

After his last effort, Valley Of
The Jeep Beets sold 300 thou-
sand-plus copies and got no
one signed, he’s back with
another effort. Terminator X
comes back with a whole new
Kool-Aid packet of flavor. Only
the commercial and skits have
hectic beats this time; the music
takes a whole new direction.
He dabbles in jazz and R&B
and he even tries his hand at
— believe it or not — bass
music!! No East Coast producer,
in my estimation, should ever
touch that. But anyway 

The album starts out kinda
strong with a hectic intro, MC’d
by one of the founding fathers
of hip hop, DJ Kool Herc. He
MC’s most of the intermissions
on the album. “Sticka” is a
posse jam featuring Chuck D.,
Ice T, Ice Cube and MC Lyte.
Lyrics are crazy phat, but the
track is crazy wack. It just
doesn’t fit. “KrunchTime,”
featuring new artist Melquan
(not to be confused with
Raekwon The Chef from the

3.

Wu), is raw as hell. The track is
smoothed out but not laid
back. Mel keeps the pace very
well. “Under The Sun” fea-
tures a new kid named Life
(I’m not sure if this is his name;
remember, I have an advanced
promo!) that rips shizz out of
the frame over a funk track.
He’s definitely someone we
should be hearing about in the
near future. The phattest track
remains to be the current sin-
gle, “It All Comes Down To
The Money. Whodini,” repre-
sents and definitely comes
extremely correct over a phat
ass smooth rhythm.

The album over all is OK, but
it leaves a lot to be desired.
How in the hell is a hardcore
deejay from New York gonna
trip and make a bass track?!?
They must not be selling
records in Miami  Anyway,
the one saving face of the
record is the deejay cuts.
Terminator wreks the fizznuck

outta his 12”s on those; but the '

album just doesn’t stand out.

Check it out if you’re into
Terminator as a producer. If
not, peep before purchasing.

Next time, I’ll have the
Starting Five Singles, plus 10
backups. (I swear I will!!) For
added flavors, peep the “40
D's” on Tuesdays from 11 p.m.
to 1 a.m. Yours Truly from 9
p.m.-11 p.m. on Fridays. Tenth
Brother from 11 p.m.-1 a.m.
on Fridays as well. Other than
that  I’m outta here like you
never knew me!

24th International Tournee of
Animation
Various artists

Damn, the things they can do
with cartoons these days.

Seems like the 24th
International Tournee of
Animation serves up a tasty,
diverse little bouillabaisse of
toons in its 90 minutes. From
the complex, disturbing family
gothic The Stain through John
Callahan’s wry, minimal 1 Thinle
I was An Alcoholic, the
Tournee shows off its fascinat-
ing collection of claymation,
animation and combinations
thereof in 15 or so pieces.

From Switzerland comes a
stunning visual study of the
sweet science, The Square of
Light, Claude Luyet’s amazing
meditation on boxing. Words,
Words_, Words is a clever car-
toon play on the conversations
occurring in a swank little cafe.
In The Sandman, Paul Berry’s
claymates tell a scary tale of a
child’s nightmare.

There is a real nod here to
animation’s commercial possi-

 

bilities as much as its artistry.
Phil Tippett’s Jurassic—like
Prehistoric Beast and Mike
Smith’s animated video for

George Thorogood, Get A
Haircut, keeps things nice and
capitalistic.

In case we’ve been sleeping
through the animation revolu-
tion in television commercials
over the last two decades, there
is also a highlight reel of Will
Vinton Studios work, they of
those damned claymated
California Raisins fame, who
were pioneers in taking the art
to the masses via Madison
Avenue.

Lowbrow, highbrow,
Hollywood or high art — this
festival has a nice mix that
oughta leave you butt-sore and
smiling.

The 24th International
Tournee ofAnimation starts
Friday and runs one weele only
at the Playhouse. Call 621-6601
for times.

Yo La Tengo means “I have
it,” in Spanish, but in the press
release it says, “Extra mayo,
please,” (those nutty guys at
Matador!) Their latest release,
Painful, has some people
wanting to know which they
prefer “I have it” or “extra
mayo, please.”

When Painful was released,
it marked the band’s seventh
full-length accomplishment.
Their previous works have
been released on a mob of dif-
ferent labels, Coyote, City
Slang, Bar None and Alias, but
they have temporarily found
shelter on Matador.

Their first recording was on a
Egon Records 7” called “The
River of Water” b/w “A House
Is Not A Motel,” way back in
1985. Interest in the band
picked up and several Yo La
T engo songs were put on vari-
ous independent label compila-
tions. Ride The Tiger, their
debut LP, appeared on Coyote
and was described as a careen-
ing harmony between Velvet
Underground and Galaxie 500.
Their music category can be
called “drone rock,” but the
manager at Kaufmann’s only
knows grunge.

New Wave Hot Dogs, a 1987
release, is kinda jangly and
happy while 1989’s President
Yo La Tengo is mean and harsh.
They commented saying,
“jumping genres from song to
song so insistently, their record
company wishes they’d cut it
out.” But their sound in Painful
has the band making their pres-
ence in various magazines’
“best album of the year” cate-

THE PI'IT NEWS, Thursda , Aril 7, 1994

gory. The album has even got
them an appearance on “Late
Night with Conan O’Brien.”

Exclusive information on the
band can be found in Yo La
Tengo’s own fanzine, Yo La
Tengo Gazette. Besides the
usual discussion of what the
band does in their free time
and their tour dates, the band
includes a section called “What
Is Your Worst Memory of
Playing With Yo La Tengo?”
Sleepyhead’s Mike Galinsky
recalls Ira stealing his beer and
Sooyoung Park from Seam
remembers Ira warning him
about taking away his power
strip.

-T he other two members are
drummer Georgia Hubley and
bassist James McNew. The lat-
ter member, formerly of
Christmas, is the band’s most
recent member. He is keeping
the band stable by filling in for
the rotation of bass players that
have parted with the band in
the past eight years.

The opening band,
Sleepyhead, will be completing
their annual ritual of a visit to
Pittsburgh. The band’s recent
LP, Piinle Rocle City, USA is
indie punk at its best, and their
cover of Game Theory’s “Girl
Like Jesus” is even better than
waiting for entrance past the
pearly gates (It’s on the “Punk
Rock City” 7”.)

Catch them Tuesday night,
April 12, at the Rosebud for an
ouer—21 “drone rocle” and indie-
punle show. What a bargain for
only $6!

Green Day
dookie
Reprise

Back in September, I went to see Bad
Religion in concert at Graffiti, and the little-
known opening group, Green Day, gave
them a run for the pulpit. They played hard
music with strong, repeating riffs and estab-
lished an easy rapport with the audience by
ripping on the ﬂoaters in the pit.

Green Day released its second full-length
LP, dooleie, on the Reprise label Feb. 1. dook-
ie is a strong follow-up to their debut LP
Kerplunle from the Lookout label.

dooleie has strong sarcastic overtones.
Green Day’s concepts deal with teenage
angst and melodramatics with some suicidal
tendencies thrown in. Burnouts are also tar-
geted with a sharp note of ridicule. Billy Joe,
Tre’ and Mike (Green Day) also include
themselves in this morass of human misery.
The passage ‘‘I’m a waste like you with noth

 

ing else to do, may I waste your time too?” in
“Emenius Sleepus” is a perfect example.

In “Basket Case” they make fun of the
whole teenaged melodrama thing. In
“Longview” they tell of sitting in a house all
day watching the telephone and wasting
away.

Their style shows strong punk roots but
with a less abrasive overtone, characterized
by sharp fluctuations in tempo, hard bass and
guitar lines and cadent drums. The riffs and
lyrics become somewhat repetitive, but the
fresh sound keeps the listener interested.

Green Day comes from the
Berkeley/Oakland, Calif. area that produced
the legendary ska band Operation Ivy. This
area has a thriving music scene with the likes
of Rancid, the Offspring and NOFX. All of
these bands have a hardcore sound that’s
original and entertaining.

Green Day has also released two EPs enti-
tled 1,039 and Smoothed Oat Slappy Hours.
Check them out.

cally and crime has risen so
rapidly that it’s no longer safe
to walk through your own
neighborhood? Well, you
become a covert vigilante who
stalks the streets at night, tak-

This is the point to which
Hollywood resident Jimmy Alto

hot—headed, aspiring actor who
has had enough of being
ripped off by petty lowlife
muggers and thieves and find-

begins to fight back, with the
help of his mentally unstable
companion, William (Slater) —

filming criminals in the act, kid- .

napping them at gunpoint and
leaving them bound and

doesn’t take long for jimmy

against it.

But that’s not really what this
film’s about. Jimmy’s selfish
motivation is what fuels his
actions (and, therefore, fuels
the film). His strong desire to
be recognized as an actor pro-
pels him to continue these
anonymous escapades once he
realizes how much of an audi-
ence he is capturing.

The bulk of this film strad-
dles the thin line between
fighting for real-life justice and
living out a failed actor’s fanta-
sy to be noticed, and director
Barry Levinson (Good Morning
Vietnam, Rain Man) does a

 pretty incompetent job of main-

taining this balancing act. Keep
in mind that this is the same
director who helmed the Robin
Williams debacle Toys, and it
doesn’t seem like he’s fully
recovered his senses quite yet.
The film tends to drag a con-
siderable amount, but Pesci’s
hyperkinetic episodes help to

pick up the pace a bit. Slater’s
mentally lackadaisical moments
— they’re the only kinds he
has — are pretty comical and
should have been alloted more
time, although they do tend to
be reminiscent of Hoffman’s
character in Rain Man.
(William even carries a portable
TV around.) Unfortunately,
Pesci and Slater alone are
unable to make the film any-
thing more than mildly
engrossing. My advice — check
this one out on video! A

much follows the same story at
the same pace as the original.

This time around the
Cleveland Indians, now owned
by ex-player Roger Dorn
(Bernsen), are faced with a
new season and new recruits to
lead them once again to victo-

ry.
Most of the same characters

from the original share the A

screen again, except for the
painfully obvious departure of
Wesley Snipes, whose ﬂashy
Willie Mays Hayes is now
played by Omar Epps (/utce,
The Program), who has a pretty
tough time of filling Snipes’
shoes.

Overall, Major League 11 is

just as silly, and its comedici

baseball routines are just as,
well, comedic as the first ﬁlm.

Suffice it to say, if you liked
the first one, the sequel should
be rather satisfying.

The Texas Rangers are an
opposing pitching coach’s
nightmare. With enough offen-
sive power to scare most small
children, some women and a
few animals, the Rangers are
going to get their runs.

Left fielder Juan “Please,
Please Don’t Call Me ‘Gone’”
Gonzalez, last year’s home run
champ, is so young (24) that it
is scary. He is a lock to hit at
least 40 dingers in The Ballpark
at Arlington, the Rangers’ new
semi—hitter’s park, and drive in
at least 120 runs.

With a healthy and — more
importantly —— sane Jose
Canseco behind him in the ﬁve
spot, Gonzalez fans may have a
decent argument for MVP if his
numbers carry over and the
Rangers walk away with the
West.

Let’s, just for a minute, play
million—dollar head cases. Um,
I’ll take Jose Canseco for $200,
Alex.

The answer; God only knows.

The question: What can we
reasonably expect from one of
the game’s brightest stars not
just two years ago, who crashed
and burned last year like Goose
from Top Gun after a mop—up
pitching performance for
Manager Kevin Kennedy?

The bottom line is that Mario

but the league is going to sorely miss
him when he’s gone.

How come they never have buns of

There’s “SportsCenter.” The Double-
A baseball Birmingham Barons took
back 25,000 free passes they had given
to local kids because those tickets are
now in demand.

It seems people want to see some
overrated, old rookie who used to play
basketball by the name of Michael
Jordan.

I want to be like Mike. I want to take
the spotlight away from the guys the
Chicago White Sox have who can actu-

ally play baseball, like MVP Frank
Thomas and Cy Young winner Jack
McDowell.

I want to be the cause when a team
screws over a bunch of little kids
because they have a chance to make
some cash.

]ordan’s fantasy camp is getting very

“hobby.” Wheres the outcry now?

Now he’s talking about buying a new

not yet clear whether the real baseball

There was an outcry a few years ago
when Bo Jackson called baseball his

Does anybody think teams like the
Pirates can compete?

Any other team in baseball ﬂat—out
dumps a great player like Ron Gant just
because he will be out a few months,
and they are in a world of hurt.

The Braves ditch Gant, lose top
prospect Chipper Jones to a knee injury
and plug in rookie Tony Tarasco in
left.

Dave Justice misses the first two
games with an ankle injury, moving
Tarasco to right, and Klesko starts
launching bombs into the seats.

Not to mention, they have Rookie of
the Year candidate Javy Lopez behind
the plate. Boom — speaking of Lopez,
there goes his first homer of the
year.

It’s bad enough that this just isn’t fair,
but did it have to be the team with the

(.273,14,73) comes over from
The Bay to give the Rangers
something that has been
severely lacking on a talented
ballclub — fiery leadership.
With Nolan Ryan now gone,
Clark is someone to step up
and fill the laid—back, hard-
working Ryan’s shoes more
vocally and with more
panache. Clark is certain to
build on his solid second half
after stumbling
through the first half with very
little clue.

As far as the rotation goes,
the word is Kevin Brown. The
right—hander (15-12, 3.59 ERA)
heads up a five—man that can
be Very good or Very, very
bad.

Bruce Hurst, an off-season,

pick-up, needs to provide
some big innings in the No. 5
spot, and Jack Armstrong (40-
64 career record with a 4.59
ERA) may be getting the last
chance to revitalize a once-
very—promising career.

Roger Pavlik will pitch a lot
of innings as the No. 2 starter
once he returns from the DL in
a couple weeks, but do the
Rangers have enough to get to
the ninth and sure-fire Tom
Henke? Rick Honeycutt and
Darren Oliver will fill in, but
the Rangers will most likely
have to rely on their starters to
carry them though seven or
eight innings to rope in the
bulk of their wins.

But hey, you always have
No. 33 over there on the bench

for a couple of innings now
and again, right Kevin? Kevin

The best starting rotation in

Dave Fleming, he of the

two pitchers who could possi-

Cy Young away from Johnson.

Bosio missed a lot of last

If Anthony can provide 20

Long walked the earth as

divisional crown. But we’ll see.

Randy Johnson is, along
with the Chicago White Sox’s
Jack McDowell, the frontrun-
ner for this year’s Cy Young.
After leading the American
League in KS last year,
Johnson (19-8, 308 K’s) may
have had the powerful season
he needed to finally push him
over the top from talented
overachiever to valuable con-
tributor to the forever-lowly
M’s.

Greg Hibbard comes over to
the No. 4 spot from the
Cubbies after a mediocre sea-
son in pinstripes, and John
“Don’t Call Me e.e.” Cummings
rounds out the starting five.

Bobby Ayala has the closer’s
job to lose:

The outﬁeld for this team is
very talented, with All-
Everything Ken Griffey Jr.
poised to take home his first
MVP award.

Right fielder Jay Buhner
(.272-27-98) is safe and (hope-
fully for Mariner fans) sound
after a bitter off-season con-

ting title in the American
League two years ago. Last
year he watched from the
bench, spending virtually the
whole season on the DL. He
will be on base to be driven in
by the big boys, but will Felix
Fermin, newly acquired from

the Tribe, fit in at short? Rich‘

Amaral leads off and plays sec-
ond and Tino Martinez will
hope to put up something -
anything, man -—- at first.

The Snow is gone in
California. No, not on Sonny

A Angels.

After being heavily rumored
in a trade with the Mets for
Anthony Young, J.T. Snow is
back at Triple—A wondering
where the hell the majors
went.

Eduardo Perez, whom the
squad is very high on, will start
at first for the demoted Snow,
and Bo Jackson will play LF,
where Perez was to play.

The remainder of the out-
field is young but talented.
Center fielder Chad Curtis
(285,659) put up solid num-
bers last year, and RF Tim
Salmon may be the player that
most thought Snow would
become.

Salmon mixes good power,
speed and average with very
good D in right to give balance
to an outﬁeld with. a big gam-
ble in left.

Can Bo put together a full

season?
' The miracle man surprised
everyone with his first at—bat
home run and his contribu-
tions to the Sox’s run last year,
but will his hip hold up
through a whole season like
he knows it will?

With Perez at first, the
Angels start Gary DiSarcina at
SS and Damion Easley at third,
a pair of keystones in the fran-
chise’s future.

ed.

Mark Langston anchors a rota-
tion that is tolerable  up to
and including its No. 2 starter
Chuck Finley. After that it gets
kind of hairy, with Phil
Leftwich, John Dopson and
Brian Anderson around to fill
the other three days of the
week.

Joe Magrane will start in the
bullpen in long relief, but if he
can rebound to the form he
enjoyed before elbow surgery,
itwill help this struggling staff.
Russ Springer, he of the Jim
Abbott deal, will serve as their
closer, but it’s not too certain
what he’ll close.

On a team of such veteran
players, it’s a wonder that the
key to the Oakland Athletics’
season rests somewhat on the
shoulders of a young fireballing
pitcher.

Stever Karsay has drawn rave
reviews from the young and old
alike for his consistent 95—plus
gas and his breakneck deuce.
Karsay’s promotion through the
organization makes it obvious
that not only does he have
Major League skills, but the big
club also needs pitching real

bad. Bobby Witt is the sup-
posed No. 1 guy with Ron
Darling and Bob Welch the
other proven vets in the five-
man.

Karsay stands at No. 4 and
Todd Van Poppel (remember
him?) is the fifth starter for a
rotation that manager Tony
LaRussa might have to juggle
once the beatings get under
way.

Offensively, the A’s should be
solid enough to put some runs
up.

Rickey Henderson returns
from free agency to lead off and
play left, and Stan Javier has
had the center field job handed
to him. Can he keep it?

Will the train run over our
hero? Does anyone care? Stay
tuned.

Ruben Sierra (.233, 22, 101)
will get over the garbage aver-
age season he had last year, and
should return to his All-Star
form, if only for a final couple
of seasons.

Wunderkind Troy Neel is

possess much speed outside of

McGwire, if healthy, might
return to his 40+ homer form of
a couple years ago.

After tanking in ‘91, he
proved critics who labeled him
a Rookie of the Year washout

wrong.
Now we’ll see if he can come
back twice.
The infield, outside of

McGwire, is not too spectacular.
Terry Steinbach is his rock-solid
self behind the dish, and
LaRussa will go a couple of
weeks before finally deciding
on Scott Brosius or Craig
Paquette at third. Brent Gates
and Mike Bordick make a solid,
young double-play combo up
the middle.

Where oh where were you
last year, Dennis Eckersley? I
don’t think you can add his
composite ERA from his career
and get 4.16 — where it was last
season. , 

His 36 saves were good, but
he blew more saves (10) than
Bill Clinton has skeletons in the
closet.

Eck is key for a pen that has
very little to work with.

So there you have it, the AL
West is there for the takin’. The

 is a plan that will
enable everyone who
buys a ticket to become a
part of a unified effort to
contemporize Pitt
Stadium.”

This is the first time Pitt
has raised its ticket prices
since 1990, and it still
leaves the cost of tickets
for home football games
below the average for Big
East schools.

The improvements will
include a new football
complex with a larger
facility for Academic
Support Services.

The weight room, train-

ing facilities and locker 1

rooms will be
upgraded.

A home for the march-
ing band and a video cen-
ter will be other
additions to Pitt
Stadium.

Concession facilities
will be improved to better
accommodate larger
crowds at Pitt Stadium.

Continued from page 10

mentary in USA Today about
how Grant Hill has NBA insid-
ers drooling after his perfor-
mance in the NCAA tourna-
ment. One question — where
were these guys the last four
years?

Back to Pittsburgh, the
Steelers made a three-year,
$1.25 million-per—year offer to
Daryl Johnston.

Even if you ignore the possi-
bility of being used as a bar-
gaining chip by Johnston in
negotiations with Dallas, I don’t
like this.

Johnston fills the hole left at
fullback when Merril Hoge left,
but Hoge could have done the
job pretty well and a lot cheap-
er.

The real downer is the fact
that signing Johnston probably
means the Steelers will not get
the wide receiver they need.
There were reports in the
papers that Alvin Harper of
Dallas and Mike Pritchard of
Atlanta were both out of
Pittsburgh’s range.

I was an early proponent of
the new system of free agency
in the NFL, especially the rookie
salary cap.

Now I am beginning to won-
der.

If a team with a relatively low
payroll like the Steelers loses
more quality players (Hoge,
Donald Evans and DJ. Johnson)
than its brings in (Ray Seals and
maybe Johnston), there is some-
thing very wrong with the sys-
tem.

Maybe I should have studied.
