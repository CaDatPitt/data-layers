THE UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Resolution Asks Senior

Dance Under. Arches

By JOHN KULAMER
Student Congress is determined to have dances held in

the Commons Room.

In spite of the fact that vice president Bill McKinley was
given the “brush-off” when he broached the subject to

Chancellor Rufus
recently, the lawmakers at Mon-
day’s meeting passed a resolution
‘favoring holding a senior dance in
the Commons Room this spring.

McKinley is chairman of a com-

_ mittee which has been working on

the project for months.

. Memorial OK

He reported that he had no
trouble in securing the chancel-
1or’s approval to holding dances
in Stephen Foster Memorial.

But he said when he tried
to obtain a similar OK for the
Commons Room, he got no-
where. l

,But Don Ewart set the wheels

rolling again when he made a

motion that Congress start plug-E
ging the Commons Room for the‘

Senior dance. '

He argued that if SC tied its
request for Commons Room danc-
ing to a speciﬁc affair, the‘impli-
cation would be that unless ap-
proval. were given the event
Would not be held.

Ewart Suggests Pressure

This, he said, was the best way
to apply p1'essure to University
authorities in the matter.

Recording secretary Grace Salz-
man proposed an amendment to
the motion to provide that the
dance would be held elsewhere
if the Commons Room were de-
nied. '

“I want to make sure that
the dance is held,” she said.

A heated debate immediately
developed.
Factions formed behind Ewart

and Salzman, tempers ﬂared,
proposals and counter-proposals
were introduced, gag rules were
invoked, and President Howard
Greenberger gained stature as a

The Pitt campus is about to be
overrun by “Hairless Joes.”

Beginning Monday, March 5, the
Spring Festival committee will
sponsor a beard-growing contest
in which all male students will be
invited to compete.

The contest is being held as part
of the development of this year’s
festival theme, “Pitt Goes West.”

Robert Lyles, chairman of the
committee, announced that loving
cups and cash prizes will be
awarded to the students with the

most unique beard, and the one.

growth.

The contest will end during fes-
tival week, at a date to be set
later.

Other events which will sup-
port the theme include a “Last
Chance” dance, a “Gold Rush”
ball, an interfraternity soapbox

ing with parliamentary trivia.
Motion Passed

A full 45 minutes later the dust
cleared, Salzman and her par-
tisans were beaten down, and the
motion was passed.

Earlier in the meeting Her-
man Levy gave a report on
the progress of his newslet-
ter-to—servicem-en project.

He said he is at present com-
piling""lists of names and ad-
dresses of the men to whom the
letter will be sent.

Says ‘Biddle

University policy is still lined
up against dancing in the Com-
mons Room, according to Dean of
Men Theodore W. Biddle.

He advanced this opinion Wed-
nesday, two days after the meet-
ing of Student Congress at which
a spring dance for seniors in the
Commons Room was called for.

Asked whether University Com-
mons Room policy is liable to un-
bend now that construction on the
proposed Student Union has ap-
parently been postponed, Biddle
stated that it was unlikely.

Furthermore, he said, “Use of
the Commons Room today, tomor-
row, or someday would militate
against the construction of an ade-
quate student union in the fu-
ture.”

If Student Congress insists on
seeking an eventual Commons
Room dance, he said, they should
work through the “regular chan-
nels”. By this he .meant that the
SC social committee should talk
with University social committee
members in further pursuit of the
question.

For most students, however, Religion—in-Life Week will
begin with the interfaith convocation Monday at 10:30 a.m.
Devoted entirely to a discussion of the impact of modern
science on religion by Dr. Kirtley Mather, the hour—long
convocation is expected to draw a record number of stu-

- dents dismissed from class for Dr. Mather’s talk.

A professor of geology at Harvard, and holder of many

ing religious laymen.

His topic, ‘Science Looks at Religion,’ aims to tie up the S 5
view-9

seemingly contradictory
points of modern science and tra-
ditional religion, and point out the
application of religion in a world
dominated by scientific processes

' and thinking.

Students in the undergraduate
schools, including The College,
Schools of Engineering, Mines,
Business Administration, and Ed-
ucation, have been officially dis-
missed from classes from 10:30 to
11:30 a.m. in order to attend.

Lounge Opens Today on 18th Floor

The long-planned and much talked-about Men’s Lounge¢

on the eighth ﬂoor opens today at 12:30 p.m. for the student
body, according to Roy Titchworth, Men’s Council president.

Complete with ping-pong tables, extra bridge tables, a
jukebox, and candy, gum, and cigarette machines ,the lounge

will be open all day until 5 p. m. 6

Titchworth has announced that
free refreshments will be served
at the grand opening about noon
today.

Cites Available Facilities

Bill Karlheim, chairman of the
furniture committee and the main
contributor to the arrangements
for the recreation room, stated
that the regular lounge furniture
could not be expected for another
40 days, but in the meantime there
would be plenty of recreational
facilities available.

In planning the design, Karl-
heim has moved all bridge tables
and chairs into 817 C1. and has
reserved the space in the hall for
the lounge furniture.

In addition to the present bridge
facilities, more tables have been
added and additional playing cards
have been purchased.

Two ping-pong tables are on
hand, and four more are on order.

ID Cards Must Be Shown

In order to use ping-pong ta-
bles, balls, and cards, students
must present their ID cards to the
person in charge who will be a
secretary from the dean of men’s
office. When the materials are re-
turned, a fee of 10 cents will be
charged for each hour the mate-
rials were in use.

This money, along with the

commissions obtained from the
vending machines, will go into a
Lounge Fund. This fund will be
used to buy more furniture and
to replace damaged or worn ma-
terials.

Karlheim stated that if the
vending machines are popular
with the students, more will be
added when additional funds are
obtained. 1

Lounge Cost $1400

To date, the lounge has cost
more than $1400. This sum has
been obtained through the sale of
books at the MC Used Bookstore
and from a lounge fund that has
been lying dormant for
years.

Beginning Monday, March 5, the

several

lounge will be open every day,

from 8:30 a. in. until 3:00 p. mu

except Fridays when it will re-
main open till 5:00 p. m.

The Westinghouse research cen-
ter has farmed out three radiolog-

one bomb putting all of the stock-
piled AEC equipment out of com-
mission. Besides the one at Pitt,
there are units at Carnegie Tech’s

Eqiiipment in Storage
According to the present plans,
each of the Pitt teams will have
four members: two trained instru-

The unit’s equipment, now stor-
ed in a Municipal Hospital cup-
board, includes: protective cover-

members against the danger of ra-
dioactive dust; four Geigar coun-
ters, used to detect radiation; and
four portable ionization chambers,
used to measure the intensity of

Recruiters Seeking Faculty
For Atomic Ray Teams

Pitt faculty members are being recruited to man radia-
tion detection teams in case an atomic attack comes before
local Civil Defense plans are complete and functioning.‘

William H. Ray, health-physicist in the School of Public
Health, is doing the recruiting. ’

The teams will use equipment loaned for the purpose

by the U. S. Aatomic Energy Commission through its biggest
contractor in this area, the West-O ‘

Public Health Research
Ray also pointed out that the

Public Health School’s indepen-'

dent and government-subsidized
research into industrial radiation
hazards and contagious diseases,
while not speciﬁcally keyed to the
Civil Defense eﬁort, will be very
valuable in case of an atomic at-
tack or bacteriological warfare.

In every inhabited square yard of the world today, in-
cluding that one you’re standing or sitting on right now,
a human being stands at the last fork in a long road in which
he has taken too many wrong turns.

At the end of one road, the downhill one that gravity
is already dragging him toward, lies destruction and anarchy.
At the end of the other one, a long steep lﬁll, lies the
goal of the whole long journey, peace.

The choice doesn’t seem diﬂicult, except that somewhere
along the way, left and right have been hopelessly con-
fused, and the traveler can’t ﬁgure out which way to turn.
And he has to go on. .
11

* *

Other men, travelers like himself, haven’t been able to
ﬁnd the right fork either, and it looks as if they’re surrender-
ing to gravity, these people named Truman, Acheson, Attlee,
Stalin, and a lot of others who get their names on Page 1
every day.

You’ll have to look in the back pages of the Saturday
paper to ﬁnd the only one who still has a map and a compass
that isn’t deﬂected by things like iron curtains. Most of
us. call him God. '

* * *

All this is leading up to the fact that next week, a lot
of people are coming here to try and ﬁnd the Man with the
Compass for us travelers. Beginning Sunday, the ﬁrst day
of Religion-In-Life Week, they’re going to be taking over
pulpits, platforms, and classrooms at Pitt, setting up a sort
of information booth at that last fork in the road.

‘Never Underestimate .

By mcx KOVAR

Girls, if you »have problems, take them to the dean of
women. If you don’t like the way your activities are run,
tell her. If you think that you have no say in things, say
something to her. But don’t come to us, at least until you’ve

been to the dean ﬁrst.
Here’s why:

For four years we’ve been listening to people criticize

women’s activities here.
heard the whole women’s program
condemned, piecemeal and in toto.
We’ve heard the dean of women
called an autocratic tyrant, and
worse. For four years, people,
most of them women, have said
that Miss Helen Rush and her
ideas about administering the dean
of women’s program were all
wrong.

7 Headless Us
Finaly, we got tired of hearing
A people talk and went ahead and
did something about it. We took
the gripes to the Chancellor and
we called one phase of the wom-
en’s activities program “Miss
Rush’s fuss and feathers.” We
stuck our editorial neck out, and
We nearly had it chopped off.

We learned, among other things,
that you girls tell us one thing
and Miss Rush another. We
learned that the very rules and
policies you scream loudest about
in the Tuck Shop, you approved
eagerly when they were presented
to you. We learned that some of
the stories you spread around as

Our Defenses Are Down

And we learned that a gentle-
man doesn’t have a chance in an
argument with Miss Rush. There
just isn’t any argument. We have
never met a more charming, dis-
arming, and delightfully pleasant
lady than Miss Rush.

We stepped boldly into her of-
ﬁce, at our own request, not hers,
armed with criticisms and argu-
ments. In ﬁve minutes we were

We’ve0

disarmed of every criticism, every
argument, and wanted only to
leave before we proposed to the
lady.

Ashamed of our weakness, we
went back for a second try. This
time we came out ready to shout
her praises to the skies and de-
fend her actions to the death.

We're _afraid to go back again.

From what you girls have told
us, we still think that there are
some policies that need corrected,
some wrongs that need righted,
some changes that need to be
made.

It's All Yours Girls '

Coronation this year will cost
something around $2500. That
seems like a lot of money, but
Miss Rush feels that it’s worth it,
and we are in no position to judge.

At any rate, we can’t do any-
thing about it. If we sit up here
and write nasty editorials that
Miss Rush has no means of an-
swering, we are being cowardly,
attacking a defenseless woman. .

If we go downstairs and give in
again, we are being cowardly,
running from a defenseless wom-
an.

If we pull out of the whole situ-
ation, we .are again being coward-
ly, but of the three cowardly
choices, this seems to fall under
that better part of valor which is
discretion.

It’s a woman’s problem, ladies,
and must be settled among your-
selves. Frankly, the editor isn’t
man enough to do it.

Poe Took a Beating .

Truth is not only stranger, but frequently funnier than

ﬁction. For proof, here are some boners collected over the
years by an English professor who teaches a survey course

in American Literature.

Don’t laugh too hard, because next year he may be quot-
ing your profound observations.
“Whitman wrote on a timely subject—sex.”

“In ‘My Captain My Captain’OA——

he used the antiseptic meter.”
“With respect to the short story.
nothing is too much in it. It must
have culmination. The words must
cease when the story ends.”

Precocious Bryant

“Bryant was a very young lad,
and I believe this affected his
poetry.”

Of Bret Harte: “When 15, his
mother, a widower, went to live
with her eldest son in California."

Here are two gems: “Franklin
wrote many poems that pertain to
certain, items.” “Franklin’s polit-

ical satires were written by Haw-
thorne, a friend of Franklin's

when he was campaigning for the
presidency.”

(Franklin, you remember, turn-
ed down the ﬁrst presidency and
died 14 years before Hawthorne
was born. The student wasn’t too
far off base, though. Franklin
Pierce was a friend of Hawthorne’s
and later became president of the
U. S.)

“Sam Sewall wrote his own
diary.”

.\

,.;r.»:- -4>_~g- 
-  ..'«.:;.=-.

Edgar Allen Poe took the W0
beating, though.

“Bryant was a moralist, Poe I

was a moron.” (Nice alliteration,
English profesors always like
that.)
great, a man must have as few
morals as possible.” On the same

theme, but funnier: “Poe had an,
easy physical makeup and. this .,

made him illustrious. His writings
lacked the moral element and this
made for immortality.” Poe’s “MS
Found in a Bottle” came ,out: “He
wrote ‘Found in a Barroom’ and
got $50 for it.”

Poe’s

not too far-fetched, but nonethe-
less funny.

“To be great as_ Poe is

reputation for tippl'l|g 
makes the chain of ‘associations, -,

“How eager
can they get?”  A“ ‘.

or once in his life, our fervent friend admits that
eagerness can be over-done! He’s alluding, of course, to all .-
these quick-trick cigarette tests—the ones that ask you to decide on cigarette
mildness after just one puﬁ, one sniﬁ, one inhale or one exhale! When the
chips are down, he realizes cigarette mildness can’t
be judged in a hurry. That’s why he made '. . .
The sensible test . . . the 30-Day Camel Mildness Test
which asks you to try Camels as your steady smoke-
on a pack after pack, day after day basis. No snap
judgments needed. After you’ve enjoyed Camels—and only
Camels—for 30 days in your “T-Zone” (T for Throat,
T for Taste), we believe you’ll know why . . .

More People Smoke Camels

Pitt ended its 1950-51 wrestling
season Wednesday afternoon at
the Stadium pavilion against pow-
erful Waynesbur-g College as the
visiting Yellow Jackets rudely de-
feated their hosts, 22-6.

The local grapplers were seek-
ing their eighth win but, instead,
squared off their season chart at
7-7.

Wednesday’s match was a com-

meet when the Panthers easily
beat West Virginia, 18-6. All but
two Panthers scored decisions
over the Mountaineers in winning
impressively.
Only Two Winners

Against Waynesburg, however,
Frank Skirpan and Gail Ellis were
the only Pitt matmen to score vic-
tories over their opponents.

Skirpan, 147-pound senior, won
his eighth match while Sophomore
heavyweight Ellis added his sixth
win. Skirpan’s record is 8-4, and
Ellis ﬁnished the season with 6-1.

The Panthers’ two leading
wrestlers, Ray Cappelli and Har-
old Miller, suffered defeats in their
last matches.

Cappelli Loses First

Cappelli, wrestling in the 123-
pound division, lost his first match_
His chart is 10 wins, two draws,
and a setback.

Miller drew a difficult assign-
ment in facing George Lewis, Na-
tional Collegiate Champion. Lewis
ﬂoored Miller, 14-4, his second de-
feat.

Harold remains the ‘winning-

est’ Panther with 12 wins.

Twins Here, Too

Well, as an aftermath of spring
registration, Pitt can boast of twin
brothers who have plenty of po-
tential collegiate football ability.

They're Bill and Tom Pickett-—
two boys who were largely re-
sponsible for Butler high school
winning the 1950 WPIAL Class
AA title with a 9-0 -0 record.
They entered Pitt this February.

Except for a slight difference
in height and weight, the brown-
haired, brown—eyed Pickett twins
are identical in appearance. How-
ever, it’s a different matter where
football is concerned.

Play Different Positions

Bill, the smaller of the two at
5-11, 175-pounds, is a halfback.
He played two years of first string
varsity ball and was a member of
the Sun-Telegraph WPIAL Class
AA team.

The other half of the duplicate,
Tom, is 6 feet tall, 180-pounds,
and was a standout tackle at But-
ler for three years.

Oddly enough, Tom says his
greatest game was the one Butler
lost to New Castle, 67-0, when he
was a sophomore.

Keyes Thrown Away

As the story goes, New Castle
had a back that year by the name
of Keyes who specialized—until
he met- up with Tom—in a weak-
side buck. Well, that afternoon

Tom literally locked the door and
threw away Keyes.

He either stopped the New Cas-
tle back cold or threw him for a
loss each time he ran the ball.

Maltony (W) . 2-1.

Usually, identical twins spend

 

‘W

Ever hear of Hal and Herb Shoener? -
Just in case you haven’t, they were the ends on the Mountaineers
lUniversity of Iowa football team several years ago. , ,

Now that in itself isn’t too amazing. But the fact that 5°°“"g mark °f 390 p°mt5'
the Shoener brothers were twins—and probably the most;
famous ever to play college f.ootball——does add the unusual;

,half their lives clearing up mis-A

Etaken identity affairs. But that’s
! not so with the Pickett twins.
Draft Proof

“We never had any trouble with
people getting us confused,”
claims Bill. “I think the main rea-
son was that we had different
classes in high school. That way
nobody c-ould get us confused with
each other.”

Both boys are in the R')TC-
which should keep them draft-
free until graduation.

Game Anti-Climactic

‘After W. Va. Thriller

’ By WILL

DOERGE

No matter what happens tomorrow at State College

when the Panthers close their basketball season against

Penn State, it’ll have to be
anti-climax.
l It is doubtful if tomorrow’s
,game—or any game—could beat
lthe thrills of the once—in—a-life-
;time game at the Stadium

‘ Here’s the score in print again
for all Pitt fans to admire——Pitt
74, West Virginia 72.

‘Greatest’ Game

An observer who has watched

ibasketball on the Stadium pavil-
ion for the 26 years it has been
.the home of
}Doc Carlson’s
cagers said,
; “That g am e
had them all
beat. It was
the greatest.”

About the

2365 fans who
gliterally rais-
‘ed the Stad-
i u m roof
would no dubt
be quick to
agree. There could have been no
ﬁtter close to the Ice-Box basket-
ball era. The best was certainly
lsaved until last.

But just as Pitt was laying for
,West Virginia, you can bet that
;Penn State is laying for Pitt.

Lions Seek Revenge

The Panthers were a 60-51 vic-
tor over the Nittany Lions here
la few weeks ago, a fact that the
"State Collegians are not likely to

forget easily.

Sports

him

“These kids were ﬂat on their backs after
trip.” he says. “Yet they had the‘. *'~—’" 

stuff to come back. I’m certainly
proud of them, very proud."
The recent upsurge of the Pan-
thers culminated Monday in the
great last-minute victory over

"West Virginia. It was their fifth

victory in six starts since they
blew the Westminster game at
Farrell.

Afraid of Carlson?

“After the Westminster game,”
relates Carlson, “they finally ori-
ented themselves on the basket-
ball ﬂoor and — -

    

ball they real-
ly were capa-
ble of play-
ing.

. “Sometimes,
I think they I
a r e m or e '
afraid of me
than they are
of the other
teams.”

As for the
West Virginia game, the stopping
of the 6-9 Mark Workman was
one of the key factors in the vic-
tory. We say stopped, even though
Workman scored 24 points.

Carnahan

Lesson ‘in Tactics
He was held to a mere six field
goals, however, far below his us-

ual game output. and was forced
to foul out by the close defensive

 

that western

play of the Panthers.

“We used different tactics on
Workman than we did at Morgan-
town last week,” states Carlson.
“Whereas we double—teamed him
then, we relied more on individual
guarding the second time.

“Workman gets away with
murder the way he tosses his
elbows, hands, and legs
around, so I told the boys ‘to
play Workman just" the way
he plays you’.

Carnahan Cited

“I started Virostek on him, but
he failed. I tried Radosevich, but
Workman broke away from him
for two quick baskets and that
was all for George.”

Carlson cited Milroy Carnahan,
a sophomore who has seen little
action this season, for special men-
tion.

“Carnahan did the best job on
Workman. In our strategy we fig-
ured it was better to let him
shoot fouls than ﬁeld goals.”

ODDS AND ENDS—Mike Belich
and George I-Iromanik between
themselves accounted for 48 of
Pitt’s 74 points . . ._ Bob Yurko
started the game even though he
was sick, but was unable to con-
tinue.

Upset Week

Upsets proved the title last
week in the playoﬂs as two highly-
favored teams met disaster.

First to be upset was the top-
seeded Little Jawns who lost to a
much smaller Mert Five team,
31-30, last Thursday.

The Merts now reign as the
darkhorse candidate for the All-
Campus title. They have been im-
proving with each game and
haven’t been defeated since early
in the season. I

The Phi Gams provided the
other big upset of the week when
they won the 1'raternity champion-
ship by beating the Phi Eps, 50-42,
last week.

The Phi Eps, wno hat ruled as
fraternity champs for the past
three years, simply couidn’t match

In the only games that went
according to plan, the Mixers beat
the Diehards, 46-34, Monday, and
the Phi Delts defeated the Sigma
Chi, 35-29, for third place in the
fraternity section of the playoffs.

Pitts Attend
ICC Meet

Pitt has been assigned to the
Committee on Commerce and Edu-
cation for the annual Intercolle-
giate Confrence on Government
which will be held in Harrisburg,
Apr. 13, 14, 15, 16.

The conference this year will
take the form of a model assembly.
Bills will be introduced, and then
either defeated or passed, just as
in the General Assembly of Penn-
sylvania, according to Ed Burtell,
chairman of the Pitt delegation to
I.C.G.

This program is in keeping with
the goal of I.C.G., which is to give
students a chance to learn how
their government operates, Burtell
pointed out.

The number of students who
will be in the delegation has not
yet been decided, but will be an-
nounced later. -

Any student who wishes to join
the organization should attend a
meeting at 12:30 p. m. Mar. 6 in
229 C1. or at 1:30 p. m. Mar. 7 in
G-24 Cl.

No previous experience in I.C.G.
is necessary. The club is open to
both undergraduate men and
women.
