BAS pelilions and is given money

By Kevin Kramer
Staff Writer

After being twice denied,
Pitt’s Black Action Society
will now receive the $5,262
it had requested for a guest
speaker.

BAS Executive Assistant
Kevin Farmer, along with
other BAS members
appealed to the Student
Government Board to have
the initial denial of money

overturned at last night’s
SGB meeting.

Though the SGB voted to
accept the BAS request,
Farmer said he felt the deci-
sion was overdue.

“[The money] should have
been there anyway,” said
Farmer.

“The university has the
money, and if their true mis-
sion is to deal with every
special interest group, then
we need the resources to

bring in lecturers so that our
students can be aware.”

SGB Allocations
Committee Chair Heather
Davidson, however, said the
amount of money available
to all organizations has been
dropping. She said the
Allocations Committee
denied the BAS request
because “we wanted to be
fair to all groups and stick to
policies which were set in
the spring.”

Ties to university spcins two decades fOl'.gl'ClCl

By Jon Hayes '
Staff Writer

Pitt guru; Panther aficionado; “Chas”
Bonasorte knows home is where the cart is
— on the corner of Bigelow and Forbes.

As owner and manager of the Pittsburgh
Stop Outside Vendor, Bonasorte—the-entre-
preneur takes special delight servicing the
clothing needs of his alma mater’s communi-
ty.
“When I wake up in the morning I don’t
look at dollar signs in my eyes. I look at
going up there and helping people, helping
them solve their problems, [that I] give peo-
ple good service and knowing that I did a
good job,” the Hazelwood native said.

In April, Bonasorte celebrated his fifth
year on the corner. But connections to the
Oakland area stretch years back into his
childhood, adolescence and college years.

Every day the 39 year old stands on the
corner across the street from Roberto
C1emente’s old corner ——- Forbes Field.

Bonasorte said, “Roberto Clemente was
always my idol. I can see this now, it’s
because he was humble. [He] was probably
one of the greatest players ever, but he
played because he loved it. He wasn’t out

there because it was a cash register.

“That’s where I am at on the corner. I’m on
the corner because I love it.”

Although the baseball star has been a life-
long inspiration for Bonasorte, his own ath-
letic skills rested in football.

Bonasorte was a scholarship linebacker for
the Panthers from 1972 to 1976. His coach,
Johnny Majors. The running back, Tony
Dorsett. Today, he proudly wears his large
1976 National Championship ring —— a
reminder of all his hard work, from football
to business.

The team posted a 1-10 record his first
yean

“Pitt football was at its lowest point ever.
If you walked into the Original Hot Dog
[Shop] and ordered a hot dog with your foot-
ball jacket on, they wouldn’t wait on you,”
he said with a laugh.

But Bonasorte said the team’s learning the
value of perseverance led to a big turn-
around. By 1976, his senior year, Pitt was
undefeated at 12-0.

“Going from the worst football program in
the country to the best team  It was more
than putting numbers on the scoreboard, it

was building character in the human beings,”
‘Bonasorte, page 5

Davidson mentioned that
the BAS has made emer-
gency requests for several
programs which have been
accepted. She said the BAS

was denied the large amount‘

of money for the guest
speaker because the commit-
tee wanted to have money
available for future emer-
gency requests.

nurses
join new
union

By Eric Smith
For The Pitt News

Two weeks ago, the regis-
tered nurses of Western
Psychiatric Institute and
Clinic voted to switch union
representation from
Pennsylvania Nursing
Association to the service
union J NESO.

JNESO stands for Jersey
Nurses Economic Security
Organization and has been
kept as the name of the
national union on the basis of
recognition, said executive
director Virginia Treacy.

Western Psych nurses are
the only nurses in the
University of Pittsburgh
Medical Center who are
unionized.

Pitt’s medical center is con-
testing the elecfion on the
basis of misrepresentation by
union officials, according to
UPMC spokesperson Jane
Duffield. Nothing more spe-
cific in regard to the claim
was forthcoming. The UPMC
filed objections with the local
labor board immediately fol-
lowing the election.

,“They’ve started a war
they’re not gonna win,” said
JNESO Labor Representative
Marc Winters. “[The nurses]
just wanted a more aggressive
union,” he said. Winters cited
job security as the main prob-
lem.

The medical center elimi-
nated 73 inpatient nursing
positions at Western Psych in
June and created 26 part-time
positions. Duffield said this
restructuring was done for the
sake of ﬂexibility.

JNESO requested an
injunction on the layoffs. It

was denied, and is currently

4BiGALA celebrates National Co

By Eric Owens
For The Pitt News

Today is National Coming
Out Day, a nationally recog-
nized day for gay people to
“unite and make their pres-
ence known, and through this
unity encourage others to
come out,” according to
Michelle Wirth, education
chair of Pitt’s Bisexual, Gay
and Lesbian Alliance.

Wirth said National

Coming Out Day originated
with a single day, but has
developed into the National
Gay History Month which
lasts throughout October. In
observance of both, BiGALA
will be attending a number of
events throughout the month,
as well as sponsoring several
of its own.

One of the events BiGALA
is planning is an information
table which will be staffed
today in the lower level of

the William Pitt Union. The
group will have a number of
pamphlets and posters at the
table to “provide information
on gay people and homosex-
uality in general,” said
Wirth.

The purpose, said Wirth,
“is to personalize homosexu-
ality, to take it out of the
textbooks and out of the
media and put it next to peo-
ple.”

BiGALA is co-sponsoring

a concert by Ani DiFranco in
conjunction with the Campus
Women’s Organization as
well as several student orga-
nizations at Carnegie Mellon
University.

BiGALA Co-President
Chrissy Koch described
DiFranco as a “bisexual,
feminist, poet, artist and
political activist, but mostly
she’s a song writer, and she’s
very good.” Wirth said
BiGALA expects an audi-

attend the Oct. 15 concert,
which she expects to be com-
prised of not only students
but other residents of the city
as well.

“We expect a big turnout,”
said Wirth. “She’s very pop-
ular on the East Coast.”

The group is planning to
attend the play “Jeffrey” on
Oct. 16 at the Stephen Foster
Memorial Theater. The play,
about a gay man who
becomes celibate because of
his fear of AIDS, will be fol-
lowed by a discussion group
in which the audience can
discuss aspects of the perfor-
mance with members of the
production.

BiGALA will also attend a
performance of Sister
Outsider on Oct. 26. Wirth
described the group as, “an
amazing group of queer
women who perform their
own poetry. They are a very
powerful and talented group
of artists  who should be
interesting to all audiences.”

Wirth said BiGALA was
planning a presentation of
the film “Philadelphia” later
in the month. .

She also said that the
group will be bringing two
speakers to the university to
speak on health and safe sex
issues, although plans have
not yet been finalized.
Additionally, she said
BiGALA was making a
“concentrated effort” to
attend freshman studies
classes to sit in and answer
questions.

in the upcoming elections,
and although Jarrett said
he and the club don’t
expect their candidates
to win, they still con-
sider it a worthwhile
effort.

“We want our voice to
be heard, and if we
accomplish -that, people
will become involved
in politics,’.’ said Jarrett.

The socialist candidates
will not be officially listed
on the ballots, but the
group hopes to receive
write—in votes.

“We consider. every
day to be election day.
Most politicians forget
about the people after
the election, and that’s
just not right,” added
Jarrett.

The club has been on
campus for the last four
years.

It sets up a table outside
Hillman Library once
a week to distribute the
weekly newspaper The
Militant.

The paper is a socialist
publication that, according
to Jarrett, prints what all
the other papers are afraid
to print.

By Bruce DeBroff
Staff Writer

The University of
Pittsburgh’s School of Nursing
is operating a new nurse-man-
aged primary care service at
the Falk Clinic in collabora-
tion with the University of
Pittsburgh Medical Center.

“We’re providing health
care in a totally different way,
and we hope it will catch on,”
said Kristine Stebler, the clin-
ic’s outreach worker, who has
15 years experience in the
field of social work.

Over the past two decades, a‘

variety of efforts have been
made by schools of nursing to
develop nurse—managed pri-
mary care facilities.

Current national emphasis
on health care reform has
brought widespread attention
to many of these nurse practi-
tioner programs.

The clinic at Pitt provides
complete health care services
and preventive care for adults
over 18. A

With a current enrollment of

  New Piﬂ nursing clinic
Her two decades

157 people in Pitt’s nurse
practitioner program, the
school of nursing is in an
ideal position to implement
this nurse-managed clinic.

With 14 years experience as
a nurse practitioner and a spe-
cial interest in women’s
health, Mary Cothran is the
clinic’s coordinator. Along
with several other nurse prac-
titioners, the clinic is aided by
Dr. Ralph Auchenbach, a
member of Pitt’s School of
Nursing faculty.

“We’re also looking to pro-
vide competent health care at
a more practical level within
the medical community,” said
Stebler.

Patients are seen in the
School of Nursing clinic by
appointment every Thursday
afternoon between 1:00 p.m.
and 5:00 p.m.

The clinic is convenient for
Pitt students, staff and faculty.
It is housed on the first floor
of the Falk Clinic/Medical
Clinic at 3601 Fifth Ave.

The union was attempting to
organize the workers at the time
of the layoffs and contends that
the timing was meant to intimi-
date the employees, said
Treacy.

This was not the first elec-
tion. The union won a vote in
October of last year that was
contested by the medical center
and ruled void.

“They’re spending hundreds
of thousands of dollars blocking
unionization in an environment
where they’re laying people
off,” said Treacy. She said that
despite the large staff of in-
house council, the medical cen-
ter has hired the law firm
Cohen & Grigsby for represen-
tation in this matter.

The firm acknowledged that
they were representing the
UPMC against the union but
declined comment on the situa-
tion. “It is not uncommon to go
outside for specialists,”
Duffield said.

When asked if the union
intended to organize other
employees of the medical cen-
ter, Treacy’s reply was “Ahh,

“The most interesting thing
about this is that she is let-

Need for welfare reform

Besides health care and Haiti, one of the most discussed

political issues this year, by both the president and Congress,’

is the need for welfare reform.

The American welfare system is one of the most inefficient
and counter-productive programs ever implemented by any
nation. The objective of the welfare system, developed in the
1960s during the Johnson administration, was to provide a
safety net for people undergoing temporary economic hard-

ship and to aid them in re—integrating into society. Instead it
has done the exact opposite.

The welfare system has created a dependent society. One
gets greater economic benefits, mainly via Medicaid, from
staying on welfare than from going out and getting an entry-
level, minimum wage job. A system which actively promotes
non-working individuals is suicidal for a society. Yet this is
exactly the system which we currently have.

Furthermore, the welfare system self-perpetuates itself.
Studies have shown that children born into dependent families
are far more likely to become dependent on welfare them-
selves. This creates a cycle of dependency, which is especially
harmful since the poor sector is by far the fastest growing seg-
ment of our population. Therefore, the number and percentage
of people living below the poverty line and dependent on the
government steadily increases.

This nation was founded on a strong work ethic. John
Smith’s motto of “work or die,” set the standard for many gen-
erations of Americans. However, the American work ethic is
now dismal. Individuals look more and more to the govern-
ment and others to provide their needs for them, rather than
supplying those needs themselves. The welfare system is an
endemic example of a greater problem which faces this coun-
try as we move towards the 2lst century.

However, the problems created by the welfare system can be
rectified and without too much difficulty. Unfortunately, the
system is so entrenched that simply doing away with it would
probably create chaos, but a gradual phasing out could be fair-
ly easily accomplished if Congress and the president could
only regenerate their own work ethics and pass substantial
reform.

Some of the proposals currently on the table involve placing
a limit on welfare benefits of two years. This would accom-
plish many things. First, it would disrupt the cycle of
dependency, because after two years, that’s it, you’re on your
own. Also it would aid in the reintegration of individuals
into society, as there would be a far greater incentive for one to
get a job since one could only receive benefits for a limited
period. ‘ A

It is not the role of the government to provide for the liveli-
hood of its citizens, which effectively means the majority pays
for the laziness of the indigent minority. A national aid system
which promotes work (“workfare” rather than welfare) is in
the best interests of all of society.

Columnist than gold

Rick And one man
NOWllIl can get it for

you. For a
a price.

In Sidney Lumet’s film
“Power,” Richard Gere
played that one man — Pete
St. John, a high-priced media
consultant to three concurrent
political campaigns who rou-
tinely ﬂew across the country
to confer with campaign
directors. In one scene he
demanded a cool quarter-mil-
lion for his services. Now,
why would people be willing
to spend that much or more in
order to be elected to a posi-
tion which only pays, at the
most, a couple hundred thou-
sand? Just one reason. Power.

Because, as the movie’s
promos said it, Nothingelse
comes close.

I was inspired to write this
column by a letter to The Pitt
News in which the respondent
unfairly criticized a June col-
umn of mine on racism. I
won’t respond directly to that
letter here, but I would like to
put forward some thoughts on
the notion of power vis-a-vis
true justice. Two truisms
come to mind. .

r _I) You cannot gain justice

by pursuing power. The

notion that justice can be
obtained by placing certain
people in positions of authori-
ty has no basis in fact. That’s
why revolutionaries and radi-
cals are rarely taken seriously,
especially in a self-centered
society such as ours.

Back in 1984, a group of
Lutheran pastors and unem-
ployed steelworkers known
respectively as the
Denominational Ministry

Clumnist looks at the desire for

Strategy and the Network to
Save the Mon/Ohio Valley
disrupted the later Easter
Sunday service at my church.
They chose my church amid
accusations that members of
the congregation who were in
the steel companies’ upper
management put them out of
work and were breaking their
union. One of the demands
the groups made was to take
the church’s entire endow-
ment — about $6 million.
Well, they demonstrated for
about three years but failed to

rally support for the cause. ’

Why? Because they wanted
power, not justice. That’s the
same reason that black
nationalists, the “religious
right” and Operation Rescue,
among others, have similarly
fallen short of their goals and
will continue to do so.

In fact, the desire for power
is at the root of all of the
human race’s social ills. Illicit
sex? Sure. Racism? It fits.
Gang violence? Robbery?
The S&L scandals? Right
there. And if I needed any
more confirmation, I went
back to the Biblical story of
Adam and Eve, and with what
did the serpent successfully
tempt them? The idea that
“you will be as gods, know-
ing good and evil.” And the
trouble with power is, as I
have said before, that the
desire for such is insatiable;
for that reason, seeking power
inevitably becomes the end
rather than the means. Former
Watergate conspirator Chuck
Colson. confessed in his book
Loving God that “the more
power I acquired, the more
power acquired me.”

Furthermore, power can
never be simply taken —— it
must be conferred, given or
even won. No leader is worth
anything without followers,
and he or she must be willing
to say what. at the very least,
people want to hear. (Rush
Limbaugh comes to mind at

power

this point). As a Pitt News
columnist and radio commen-
tator, I have a certain amount
of power awarded to me, but
if I write or speak about
things without proof, I run the
risk of forfeiting my audi-
ence.

2) You cannot pursue jus-
tice without building relation-
ships. Justice for one neces-
sarily means justice for all.
One reason such‘ radical
groups fail to cause change is
because of their inability to
relate to anyone else outside
their sphere of influence -
they foolishly think that they
will prevail because of sheer
“moral force.” On the other
hand, the early Christians,
who had no political power to
speak of in ancient Rome,
outlived what was then the
most powerful empire in the
world simply by sharing their
“good news” with whomever
they came into contact. In the
Philippines, the people chased
dictator Ferdinand Marcos by
similarly reaching the Filipino
military, Marcos’ power base.
_ Again, justice never occurs
in a vacuum. For example,
you cannot seek justice for
blacks without seeking justice
for whites, as racism affects
both profoundly. Sexism traps
both men and women in its
snare; any solution must con-
sider both sides. Those who
claim religious bigotry need
to come into relationship with
their “God-rejecting” foes to
see what needs to be done. ,

You might get power by
striving for justice, but not the
other way around, and unless
and until people learn that,
the evils that they attack will
be just as intransigent as they
ever were. There is a formula:
Love leads to justice, with
power the side effect. That’s
the ultimate goal.

Nothing else comes close.

Street Talk:  
On what concerns should SGB candidates concentrate?

  

 

"SGB should be concerned
with safety at night especially
on weekends, because the bus
system is not as frequent on
weekends. Van call sometimes
takes a long time. Maybe they
could have an escort system
until 4 or 5 a.m."

"I like to bowl. Maybe Pitt
could have more trips for stu-
dents. There should also be
more security in front of the
Towers. Try and take care of
the homeless on campus, get
them off campus."

    

"More activities that are
viable for a large number of
student body. Penn State has
more concerts that are for a
larger group of people, groups
like Phish, groups that will get
a larger number of students."

"Make it easier for students
to go through the framework
of the university, with advising
the students. Make it known
what some of SGB's proposals

are. Make students more
informed of what Pitt is doing.
Maybe have telnet notes of
SGB meetings, and not just

 

"Safety should be first pri-
ority for students. We need
more people on campus for
surveillance patrols, like the
bike patrol. Maybe expand
bike patrol. Give studentmore
peace of mind."

Ben Jackson's ROTC column was right on

Ben Jackson hit the nail on the head
with his piece, “The Role of ROTC on
Pitt’s Campus.” ROTC’s main goal is to
train leaders. Killing comes with the ter-
ritory. Ever since the First Continental
Army assembled for training in
1775, men and, since the integration
of the army, women have been placed
in leadership roles in the U.S. mil-
itary.

The idea of soldier-scholar is an old
one, dating back to Greece and Rome.
The ROTC program has been turning
out fine officers as well as great citi-
zens since the early part of the 20th cen-
tury. '

As for his friend who is a little left of
Karl Marx, this person does not realize
that the sacrifices of military men and
women in American history allow her to
have the views that she has. In America,
we do not have armored personnel carri-
ers cruising the streets as in such fine

Marxist countries like Cuba, North.

Pro-/ilfe protesters
are not all peaceful

Korea and the former Warsaw Pact
nations. This is due in part to Mr.
Jackson’s point that segregating officers
leads to a warrior class detached from
the people.

As for combat exercise, we held a
field training exercise the weekend of
Oct. 7-9 at Camp Dawson. This exercise
builds leadership skills in areas such as
patrolling and land navigation, essential
for the movement of any size formation
of troops.

One more thing: As long as the
University receives money from the
Department of Defense budget, we will
be here. I believe the estimate is $65
million. I think the Chancellor and all of
the bigwigs will listen to that as
opposed to a few disaffected and dys-
functional holdovers from the heyday of
socialism.

Right wing Haitian leaders cradled

Recently, President Clinton was
talking on nationwide television about
how brutal Haiti’s military leaders
were. He talked about how the horri-
bly mutilated bodies found in the
streets, the use of rape as a political
weapon against dissidents and the
killing of orphaned children.

Now, suddenly, they are not such
bad guys after all and an amnesty
has been granted to them. They are
even allowed to still live in the coun-
try.

Can anyone imagine a leftist leader
that was being deposed by U.S. forces
being treated so compassionately? If
this were Castro instead of Cedras,
how would he be treated? How were
Sukarno, Lumumba and Allende
treated in the CIA-sponsored coups
that overthrew their governments?
They were killed!

It seems that a right-wing leader
who helps the rich and powerful,

underneath all the human rights abus-
es, is not really a vicious criminal, but
just a little misguided and overzeal-
ous.

Governments run by big business,
such as the United States, do not
make interventions in foreign coun-
tries on behalf of the common people
of that country or of the United States.
They make interventions on behalf of
big business!

Aristide will be restored but only as
a figurehead with no real power.
He will never again be able to threat-
en the profits of the American assem-
bly plants in Haiti by attempting to
raise the minimum wage from 14
cents an hour to 50 cents an hour. The
Haitian people lose again, as they
have many times since their slave
armies defeated Napoleon's troops in
1804.

Reader says Pitt News editoral
shows no concept of journalism

This letter is in response to
the article about the
CWO protest. We respect the
beliefs of the pro-life protest-
ers.

However, some of them
were not so peaceful. The
article leads you to believe
that "two anti-abortionists,
Jessica Garris and Marguerite
Collins, were protesting in
response to CWO. They felt
they needed “to do more than
a silent protest.” Yet what
they actually did was harass
two pro-choice advocates
silently posting their litera-
ture.

The two pro-life protestors
followed the two pro-choice
advocates for about a block,
across the street and back
again while yelling pro-life

slogans.

They continued to yell and
stand in front of them while
the pro-choice advocates sat
silently. It seems that these
were the two girls who
did this since the rest of the
pro-life chain remained
silent.

To us, this is harassment,

"not freedom of speech and in

no way was similar to the
CWO protest. They were tar-
geting individuals and insti-
gating a confrontation.
We don’t think these two peo-
ple represented the peaceful
sentiments of the pro-life
chain.

Whoever wrote the Oct. 6 editorial (“Haley

decision to pull the University limes story

of both the function of journalism and the con-

to a heavy-handed act of, yes. censorship.
What’s worse, Haley justiﬁes his tactics with a
patently ludicrous assertion that reporting on

the ceremony would somehow itself be an act

of discrimination. Haley’s desire
to hush up the changing sta-
tus homosexuals at Pitt is a barri-
er to - true nondiscrimina-
tion and the wider acceptance of
same-sex unions.

The university recently con-
cluded a campus-wide celebra-
tion of diversity. Apparently,
Haley would prefer that we

appreciate diversity only in the abstract, rather
than face‘ a concrete example of a kind of
diversity that makes some people uncomfort-

able.

Columnist to show the

Keith games you
Pompey don’t want to
see.

Have you ever noticed that
when Pitt or the Steelers
aren’t playing, it’s a great
weekend for football? But
when they do play, you are
stuck calling distant relatives
asking about the games you
wanted to see. ’

This past weekend was a
prime example. Pitt was play-
ing Syracuse on Saturday,
while the Steelers had the
weekend off.

Watching ESPN College V
Gameday, I thought this was
going to be one of the best
weekends for college football.
All the sportscasters kept talk-
ing about was the Notre Dame

‘ vs. Boston College matchup.

They told of how these were
the only Catholic universities
to play Division I football.

Searching in the local list-
ing, I didn’t see anything
about that contest. This kind
of took me by surprise
because the Irish always play
on NBC. But then I thought
Notre Dame is going to kill
BC and who wants to see
that? '

Actually, it turns out that the
BC-Irish matchup was tele-
vised by ABC, but it was pre-
empted locally for the Pitt-
Syracuse game on the Big
East Football Network

I watched the Panthers get
their butts kicked up and
down the field by the
Orangemen of Syracuse. _
Meanwhile the Eagles took it
to the Irish.

I became excited and started
to ﬂick channels, trying to
find the game. But the game
was being blacked out
because of the Pitt contest.
That was terrible. _

So what that we live in the
Pittsburgh area, Pitt games
aren’t exactly the game of the
week.

While Saturday’s coverage
was filled with boredom, the
next day was a dream come
true. For the second week in a
row, the Steelers didn’t play
on Sunday.

Ryan could

By Sean Duncan
Asst. Sports Editor

Quarterback John Ryan, who
checked in for starter Sean
Fitzgerald after Fitzgerald hurt
his ankle late in the second
quarter against Syracuse,
might be the Homecoming
starter Saturday versus West
Virginia.

“Fitzgerald is questionable
for the ball game,” coach
I 0 h n n y
Majors said
at yester-
day’s press
conference.
“He turned
his ankle he
hurt particularly against
Louisville.

“We don’t know whether
he’ll be back until practice
week.”

Ryan came in with 4:30 left
in the second quarter and
moved the ball with more effi-
ciency against Syracuse than
Fitzgerald had. Ryan orches-
trated the only Pitt score of the
game late in the fourth quarter.
In that drive, he completed a
perfect 5-for-5 for 58 yards.

Ryan finished the game- with
125 yards, as he hit receivers
consistently, going 9-for-12.

“Ryan stepped in and did a
respectable job to say the
least,” Majors said.

Conversely, in Fitzgerald’s
stint, the offense was com-
pletely stagnant. He completed
a lowly 3-for-7 for 20 yards.

Umbleby

Cross
country
star a quiet
success

By David Saliba
Staff Writer

The path that senior Mike
Umbleby has taken on his way
to becoming a premier athlete
has been a quiet one. A dis-
tance runner on the Pitt track
team, Umbleby has persevered
athletically and academically.

His success on the track and
in school is unheralded and is
overshadowed by the “big
names” of the revenue sports.

“Mike, I don’t think cares
very much about publicity, and
if he does, he doesn’t voice it,”
distance coach Mark Schwartz
said. “He doesn’t vocalize it, in
fact he probably uses it to
motivate himself.”

It is this characterization of
Umbleby that reflects his ath-
letic career at Pitt.

John Ryan was 9-for-12 at Syracuse ﬁlling in for injured starter Sean Fitzgerald.

East in passing efficiency
(.471). Consequently, Pitt is
second—to—last in the confer-
ence in passing offense and
scoring offense. He has
thrown seven interceptions
and four touchdowns so far
this season.

Ryan took advantage of his
only passing attempt prior to
the Syracuse game. On a fake
field goal attempt against
Boston College, Ryan took the

snap, rolled right and lofted a
3-yard touchdown pass to
Maurice Washington for Pitt's
only TD in the 21-9 loss.

Ryan started 10 games last
year for the Panthers and
threw for six touchdowns and
eight interceptions. Outof 203
attempts, he completed 56.7
percent of them for 1,284
yards.

Other notable injuries: Wide
receiver Mark Butler (shoul-

der), linebacker Myles Davis
(foot) and running back Curtis
Martin (ankle) are all out for
this weekend. Davis also suf-
fered his injury against
Syracuse last weekend.”

Defensive back Daryl Cash
(neck) is questionable.

Tom Tumulty (foot), tail-
back Tim Colicchio (ankle)
and offensive guard Brian
Curran (ankle) are probable
for Saturday.

“Mike is a person that came
into Pitt not necessarily a her-
alded person,” head track

coach Steve Lewis said. “What
he brought with him, as far as
I’m concerned, was the drive,

the dedication, the consistency
and the work ethic of not
accepting yesterday’s perfor-
mance.”

“I have to work hard, and I
enjoy it, I enjoy the competi-
tion,” Umbleby said.

For Lewis, it is what
Umbleby can pass on to others
that makes him even more
valuable to the team.

“If anybody is going to
model themselves in terms of
what it would take to be a top-
notch athlete at Pitt, or in the
East, all they would have to do
is find Mike Umbleby’s foot-
steps and follow in them, and
they won’t lose.”

One teammate who may not
be following those footsteps, is
Frank Nesko. Yet Nesko is
right beside them.

“More than motivating, he is
competitive,” Nesko said. “We
do things that each other do,
because we see each other hav-
ing success so we want to do
what each other has done.”

Nesko, who lives with
Umbleby and considers him a
best friend. will admit that
when it comes to dedication
and hard work, his friend is
one up on him.

For The Pitt News

Old habits die hard.

If recent history is any
indication, any time that Pitt
plays Penn State in any
sport, a loss appears
inevitable.

Such was the case with the
Pitt rugby club, as the No. 4
nationally ranked Nittany
Lions handed the Panthers
their first loss of the season
by a score of 55-5.

The loss puts the first
blemish on Pitt’s record,
which currently stands at 4-
1.

Rugby club president
Chris Fortin offered few
excuses for the loss.

“The loss was kind of an“

embarrassment for the team.
But it was still a good learn-
ing experience playing
against the No.4 team in the
nation. It was still a really
tough loss.”

Penn State totally con-
trolled all facets of the con-
test. Pitt could not get any-
thing generated on offense,
nor could it stop Penn State
on defense.

The B-side squad did not
fare well either, as it also
lost handily to the Nittany
Lions.

Fortin said, “Penn State
really controlled the entire
game, but it is good to face
that type of competition in
order for us to improve.”

For the Panthers, this
improvement will have to

come against their next
opponent, Indiana University
of Pennsylvania (IUP).

Earlier in the season, IUP
was narrowly defeated by
Penn State 3-0.

The game was played
under horrible conditions,
which accounted for the low
score and close game.

When the Panthers travel
to Indiana on Saturday, a
victory will not be all that is
on their minds.

A victory against IUP and
a victory in the season finale
against the University of
Pennsylvania will give
thegteam a very good shot at
clinching a spot in the
Midwest Tournament, which
is held at Bowling Green

Umbleby

°From page 11

“He’s much more dedicated
than I am,” Nesko said. “He’s
100 percent dedicated to run-
ning every night. His priorities
areschool, running and then
everything else, whereas my
priorities are along different
lines.”

The combination of sports
and academics does not always
mix well, and it is not uncom-
mon to see athletes with
unchallenging majors.

But take pharmacy, a five-
year program that is listed
among the top five most diffi-
cult majors on the undergradu-
ate level. It is a field that
requires hours of work outside
of class not to mention a strong
background in science and
math.

It is a field that is difficult
enough on its own, but take
Umbleby, let

season for the Pitt squad.

“I would consider him one of
the top distance runners in the
East,” Lewis said.

According to Schwartz,
being a captain is not by virtue
of being a senior but rather by
showing leadership qualities.
For junior Ed Adamson,
Umbleby is one to boost moral
and provide leadership for the
team.

The importance of
Umbleby’s success is magni-
fied by the loss to injury of the
other captain, senior runner
Nesko. Although there is no
direct pressure on Umbleby, it
is a position he does not mind
being in.

“I like being the underdog,
the one who people think has
no chance,” Umbleby said. “I
just go out and run the best I
can. With [Nesko’s] injury, it
just takes a

him major in
pharmacy along
with a career in
track, and after
four years wait
and see if he
can succeed in
either or both.

said. “He’s

number of aca-
demic awards,” Schwartz said.
“He’s a phenomenal student.”

“He’s in pharmacy, which is
no picnic at Pitt, and he’s
doing pretty good at that too,”
Lewis said.

Accomplishments, accolades
and compliments are handed
out with ease when talking
about Umbleby. One recurring
theme is the strong quiet lead-
ership of the senior runner.

“Mike is a silent leader, a
leader by example. He’s a
leader in the classroom, and
he’s a leader as a person,”
Lewis said. “His demeanor
itself is an example of leader-
ship.”

“He’s a cerebral type guy,”
Schwartz said. “He’s a think-
ing-man type of person.”

“I don’t say much,”
Umbleby said. “If I’m a leader
at all, it’s probably by [exam-
ple].”

The intellect and workethic
of Umbleby have thrust him to
the top as a distance runner in
the East and as a captain this

healthy, and he
will be in the upper echelons in
[track].”

With this being his final sea-
son, Umbleby’s career epito-
mizes the phrase, “Speak softly
and carry a big stick.”

The big stick is his statistics
and what he has helped Pitt
accomplish during his time
here.

When reflecting upon his
athletic career at Pitt, one
memory comes to the forefront
of his mind. It was late last
spring at the Big East Outdoor
Championships at Villanova.

“The competition came
down to [Jim] Monk,”
Umbleby said. “He was a
senior and had the chance to
win it, and he did, that was
really great.”

From a four-year perspective
on his track career, Umbleby’s
point of view is humble. What
he lacks in saying on his own
account, others make up for.

“He’s probably the best run-
ner we have, honestly,” Nesko
said. “He’s all class.”

This meant that both NBC
and FOX were going to air
games for the second week in
a row; Fans would be able to
see quality games, not the
Steelers vs AFC Central
opponents, the teams that
make up the worst division in
football. Watching Pittsburgh
beat Cincinnati is boring,
especially when other cities
are watching the 49ers vs. the
Cowboys.

You did not have to worry
about this on Sunday. The
networks showed great
games. On NBC, the
Chargers, the NFL’s only
undefeated team, dismantled
Joe Montana and the Chiefs
20-6. Before that, the same
station showed the Bills
defeat the Dolphins 21-1 1.
While the Bills were on
NBC, the Cowboys whipped
Buddy and his crew (the
Arizona Cardinals) 38-3 on
FOX.

Living in America, we
should be able to watch the
games that interest us.

I am not saying I dislike
the Panthers or the Steelers,
but I would like to see the
real games of the week, and
so far this season both teams
have been far from that.
