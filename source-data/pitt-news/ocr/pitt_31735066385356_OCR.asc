In a worldwide broadcast
Saturday, Nov. 19, President
Ronald Reagan and General
Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev will
receive the 1988 Beyond War
Award.

Beyond War is a non—profit,
non-partisan, educational organi-
zation whose goal is to cause na-

.tions to work together to build a

world without war.

Jane Weil, a full-time Beyond
War volunteer, said that in order
to end international conflict,

change must occur. ”The change
has to come from the individual,”
said Weil. ”When enough in—
dividuals change the way they
think about living together as a
species, then a change will occur,
but it has to start within the in-
dividual.”

' The organization rests on two
basic principles. ”First, that we
are one planet, one life support
system; and, second, that war is
obsolete.” Weil continued,
”Technology has made war a
way of resolving conflict,instead
of a working alternative. We have
to find a new way of resolving

Organization praises Reagan, Gorbache

conflict in our global com-
munity.”

We have to find a
new way of resolving
conflict in our global
community. '

The Beyond War Award is the
highest acknowledgement of

publicity received by a group or

individual that has done the most
to advance the cause of a world
beyond war.

”The award is being given to
these two world leaders in recog-
nition of the determinative role
they have played in responding
to the people of the world who
desire peace,” said Richard Rath-
bun, president of the Beyond
War Foundation.

Each year, hundreds of names
are submitted to the Beyond War
Foundation and the recipients of
the award are chosen from a

v for peace

panel of 22 distinguished men
and women. The panel includes
Carl Sagan, director of the
Laboratory for Planetary Studies
at Cornell University, Jonas Salk,
founder of the Salk institute for
Biological Studies and Mary
Louise Smith, former chairwom-
an of the Republican National
Committee.

The award ceremony, which
will be broadcasted via satellite,
will include live appearances by
American Apollo astronaut Rusty
Schweikert and Russian cos-
monaut Svetlana Savitskaya.

U.S. Congressman addresses students about education

By Adam W. Richter

Staff Writer

When Congressman Louis
Stokes was growing up in Ohio,
it was his mother's dream that he
graduate from high school, Stokes
said in a speech about motivation
in education on Thursday night.

Stokes’ speech was a part of the
Black Action Society's Black
Week, held Nov. 7-12.

’’It was her greatest dream that
her boys [Louis and Carl] acquire,
not college degrees, but high
school diplomas,” Stokes said of

his mother. ”At that time, for a
black youngster, a high school
diploma was the key to open up
the door to a relatively good job.”

Stokes volunteered for the
Army after high school. When he
was discharged, he took advan-
tage of the GI Bill and went to
college. His mother, however,
encouraged him to get a job in—
stead, so that he could help her.

”She just couldn't wait for me
to go through all this additional
education." Stokes got a job and
went to college at night. This in-

cluded law school, which took ”

him four years.

Stokes’ brother Carl saw what
he was doing and went back to
high school to earn his own
diploma, and later went to col-
lege. Stokes said that as a result,
Carl was later elected to the Ohio
state legislature. in 1967, Carl be-

came the first black mayor of

Cleveland, which was the eighth-
largest city in the United States.
in 1968, Stokes was elected to
the U.S. House of Representa-
tives, becoming the first black
congressman from Ohio. Accord-
”ing to him, his mother was the

motivation for his
plishments.

”Had it not been for her im-
Tploring and begging and urging
us to acquire an education, Carl
and I probably would have gone
the way of most of the young
men with whom we associated
with at the time,” Stokes said of
his mother. He also stated in his
speech that most of the peers he
had when he was growing up are
either dead or in prison.

”We were fortunate in our fa-
mily to have this type of a
mother,” Stokes continued,

accom-

”even though we were not for-
tunate enough to have a father at
home.”

During his 12 terms in Con-

gress, Stokes served on many '

committees, inluding acting as
chair on the Intelligence Commit-
tee, the Ethics Committee and the
House Select Committee on As-
sassinations in 1976, which in-
vestigated the deaths of John F.
Kennedy and Martin Luther King
Jr. In addition, Stokes served two
terms as chairman of the Con-
gressional Black Caucus.

Society Chairwoman Celeste
Myers.

”Overall, it was a success be-

Black Week began Nov. 6 with
the 19th annual Gospel Night. A

the special guest.

On Monday night, former CBS
White House correspondent Lee
Thornton spoke about her ex-

Thornton said that the 1988
campaign represented a change

al personality. 4

Qualls also discussed the rela-
tionship between blacks in Afri-
ca and American blacks. She said
that her trip to Africa changed her
life, and she was surprised how
receptive the Africans were to
her.

Myers said, ”[Qua||s] ‘was ex-
cellent. I had never heard of her
before, besides from information
at BAS, but she was an excellent
speaker.”

The Black Bazaar was the main
event on Wednesday. Black en-
trepreneurs from the Pittsburgh
area sold a variety of products to
the students. ‘

’’It was interesting, but I felt
there should have been more

Myers said, adding she felt that
there had been more products in
past years. -

. Gang-

related

_ deaths
  increase

By Jeff Wilson

Associated Press Writer

LOS ANGELES (AP) - Drug-
dealing gang members are mur-
dering in record numbers despite
police sweeps and the mayor’s

. pledge to ”take these terrorists off

the streets.”

But authorities insist the battle
is being won in target areas such
as south—central Los Angeles and
say those successes are not
reflected in the numbers.

’ Police department figures show
gang-related homicides rose
-threefold in October compared
with the same month last year,
from 11 to 33. For the year
through Oct. 31, they were up

Q nearly 25 percent, from 166 in

1987 to 207.

This year’s total already sur-
passes the record 205 gang kill-
ings for all of 1987.

In Los Angeles County areas
where the sheriff enforces the
law, 79 gang—related murders
were recorded by late October,
matching the total for all of 1987.

Meanwhile, crack-dealing

. Crips and Bloods, the deadliest

gangs in the nation's second-
largest city, continue to surface in
towns and cities across the
western United States.

”We aren't losing the war, we
just aren't winning in the data,”

Germany's mistakes

can't be overlooked

The power of prejudice has struck again.

The president of West Germany's parliament, Philipp Jenninger,
resigned on Friday after receiving strong, negative response for say-
ing that many Germans initially found Hitler's rule ”glorious”.

Jenninger addressed Hitler's rule of Nazi Germany in a speech held
at a special session of parliament on the 50th anniversary of Kristall—
nacht, Nov. 9 and 10, 1938. On this night, Nazis destroyed Jewish
homes, businesses and synagogues, and sent 30,000 Jews to concen-
tration camps. The Nazis mockingly named the night Kristallnacht,
or Crystal Night, in the midst of shattered glass covering the streets.

Jenninger also called Hitler's leadership a ”triumphant procession

during the first years.”

J Fifty years have passed since the onset of Hitler's atrocities. Yet,
Nazi ideology appears to remain in Jenninger’s inappropriate and in-

excusable remarks.

In the years between 1938 and 1945, the Nazis exterminated 6

million Jews and millions of others in the most horrible ways known’

to mankind. The only gompensation the world can offer to survivors
and families of those murdered is to ensure that such action never

occurs again.

Jenninger overlooked his responsibility as a national leader when
he made rash -generalizations in addressing the dark period of the
Nazi's Third Reich. In reality, Hitler created a powerful and warped
force. However, for Jenninger to define Hitler’s leadership as ”tri—
umphant” is to overlook and distract our generation from the lesson
we must learn from the Holocaust.

As a leader, Jenninger is expected to use his voice wisely and clear-
ly. He claims his speech ”was not understood” by many listeners.
However, his position and the subject matter are too important for

any misunderstandings.

Hitler's rise-to power is a complex, controversial issue and cannot
be suitably evaluated within a speech. When we fail to place the
proper attention on our mistakes, we increase the chances‘of repeat-

ing them._

In a nutshell...

”He did not know what was going on, and that's not

right.”

— Nancy Reagan, commenting on her husband .

Post-election marriage counseling

One of the busiest periods for
marriage counselors is directly af-
ter a presidential election. Nerves
are raw and the wounds are
deep.

That's the way it was when the
Clydesteins walked into Dr.
Orange Gimlet’s office.

”What seems to be the trou-

ART
BUCHWALD

ble?” asked Dr. Gimlet.

”I’m finished with this marri-
age,” Mrs. Clydestein told him.
”I decided I can't stand the heat,
and I want to get out of the
kitchen.”

”What did he do wrong?”

”We|l, for starters, every time
we've gone somewhere during
the last three months he's called
me by my ’L’ name.”

Mr. Clydestein said,”I only
called her the ’L’ name during the
Republican Convention when
she jumped up and down on our
bed and shouted, ‘Where was
George?’ ” '

Dr. Gimlet reassured them,
”So far you sound like a very nor-
mal couple. I haven't heard any-
thing to warrant a split-up.”

”He’s a brute,” Mrs.‘Clydestein
said. ’’I asked him what if a store
clerk took my credit card and for-
got to return it, should that sales-
man get the death penalty? Mr.
Conservative responded that
there was no other choice. I don’t

want to spend the rest of my life
with someone who is so lacking
in compassion for his fellow
man.”

”And I don’t want to live with
a bleeding heart,” Mr. Clydestein
added. ”She claims that the only
reason Willie Horton got into so
much trouble was because Dan
Quayle refused to play golf with
him on weekends.”

Dr. Gimlet said, ”There seems
to be a slight ideological break-
down between the two of you.
Can you pinpoint the moment
when you started drifting apart?”

Mr. Clydestein answered, ”I
had my first suspicions when she
refused to recite the Pledge of Al-
legiance before the Monday night
football games.”

”Some women are like that,”
Dr. Gimlet “said. ’’It doesn't
necessarily make them disloyal
wives.”

”I cannot remember a day
when she offered to salute the
flag vo|untarily,” Clydestein told
Gimlet.

”How could I?” Mrs.
Clydestein asked her husband.
”You slept in it all the time.
Whenever I put my hand over
your chest, you said, ’Get your
arm off Old Glory. It's my flag
and I paid for it.’ ”

By now Mrs. Clydestein wasin
tears. ”He never understood my
stand on the environment. Every
time.he disagreed with me, he
told me that if I didn't like it to
go water skiing in Boston

Harbor.” -

Dr. Gimlet said, ”This is start-‘

ing to sound serious. There could
be a negative element here much
deeper than mere po|itics.”

”There is,” added Mrs.
Clydestein. ”It’s a question of
competence. Things really fell
apart for us when I mentioned to
my husband that I didn't want to
be married to a man who got
turned on by dirty commercials.”

Mr. Clydestein said, ”All she
has against Bush is his shrillness.
If she listened to what his han-
dlers had to say, instead of read-
ing George’s lips, she would
know what Bush will do for this
country.”

Dr. Gimlet told them, ”All
right, I've heard your passionate
pleas, and I must say that each of
you has strong arguments. But the
election is over and whether you
like it or not, you both have to
live with the same president for
the next four years. This means
that you must forget all the cheap
shots and think about the kinder,
gentler world that George Bush
promised every American. Are
you prepared to do this?”

Mr. Clydestein replied, ”I’m
willing to try if she will just stop
yelling when she goes to bed,
’Don’t forget to turn out the thou-
sand points of light, dummy.’ ”

pastimes.
Oprah, Geraldo, Sally Jessy,
Morton, and let us not forget the

. man who started it all — Phil.

These courageous souls inform
America and bring the issues into
light.

Gee! If it wasn't for Geraldo, I
wouldn't know 10 different ways
to satisfy someone sexually.

Oprah taught me that high
heels are.-in:-and-.short hair is out.

And dear old Morty has uncov-

ered the true fact that anyone
who is gay, bisexual, liberal, not
racist, or likes to eat peanut but-
ter by the spoonful is just plain,
downright subversive!

Mort appeals to people who
are tired of being polite and nice.
He doesn't hide behind a neatly
pressed suit and tie like Dona-
hue. By the end of his show, he
looks like a slob and acts like one
too.

His audience releases its frus-
trations about the way he con-
ducts his show or toward the
transvestites, bi’s and gays on the
show by yelling ”Hey, you're
queer!”

However, when the rest of the
”Fabulous Five” do address the
real issues in American society,
they usually rsensationalize.  ..

Instead of questioning the lead-

er of a support group for rape vic-
tims, Geraldo sets up his little
anonymous screen, and we are
privileged to hear a step by step
account of a rape victim's attack.

Does this do anything except

make viewers feel physically ill, .

or, for those sadists in the au-
dience, turn them on?

Yes. It makes our TV talk show
hosts a hell of a lot of money.

And they'll just keep shoveling
it in because the viewers are eat-
ing up their shows like candy.

The usual comment from a talk
show junkie is ”I hate him [her].
I don’t believe much of the stuff
he puts on.”

Then why watch it? Why
schedule classes around your
favorite talk show? Why be a
hypocrite and watch something
you hate?

Talk show hosts cater to what
their audiences like. That’s'why
we find scantily clad female wres-
tlers fighting in a mini—ring while
Geraldo, dressed appropriately in
silk boxing shorts, an Oxford but-
ton down and his usual set of sus-
penders, screams into the camera
”Moms, get your kids out of the
room! This isn't a show for kids!”

Yes! It is a show for kids, and
for people who like to watch
black activists and members of
the Aryan Resistance Movement
beat the hell out of each other
and the studio audience.

These talk shows are for peo-
ple who don’t really want to treat
issues seriously, people who
probably liked the slimy commer-
cials of the recent non—issue
presidential campaign.

And obviously, since Bush
won, that is the majority of the
American ‘people.

THE PITT NEWS

Monday, November I4, I988

Is there really any explanation for student apathy?

Apathy seems to be the key
word on college campuses these
days. It is bandied about with the
same freedom that the phrase
”free love” was in the '60s, or the

JOHN
BERGER

”me” generation in the '70s. It is
the media's catchphrase for youth
of the late '80s. So, perhaps it
needs to be examined. Apathy.

I am up<1LIiCLi\.. I DUIICI IIUIII Lillb
pervasive condition. I didn't vote
in the presidential elections. I

didn't vote for Homecoming king _

and queen. I am not going to vote
for SGB members. I just don't
care. _

It isn't that I don't think that
these things affect me — I know
they do. I know that with Bush as
president it will be difficult for
me, and others like me, to obtain

financial aid for college. I know
that important social reforms are
needed in the nation. I am also
aware that Bush has things going
for him as a leader, too. I just
don't care.

I have things on my mind. Pet-
ty things. My day-to-day life is not
what I would wish. I have school,
work, relationships; things that re-
quire my immediate attention. I
don't seem to have the energy for
them, let alone for the course of
the nation over the next ‘four

ybul J.

What bothers me is that I also’
know that these things are impor-

tant. Very important. But I lack
the essential inclination to extend
my world to include these things.
Why?

My parents raised me to care
about others. And within my life,
within the circle of people I
know, I do care about people. I
try to help people who need me,

I try to like people I meet
(although I admit that this is not
one of my particular skills). I can't

seem to extend beyond this,

though.

Ifeel like there is an important
question lurking here some-
where, there must be a ”why”
here somewhere. The immediate
ideas I have on the causes of this
seem to be cliches, oriented
primarily around TV. TV is the
way that I have learned about the
world, it is virtually my only

I nuuvn n

nation, about other nations. And
it is essentially an unreal
medium.

Word of mouth is not necessar-
ily the best way of getting infor-
mation.’ This is obvious. Things
are distorted, confused, slanted
and biased. But it is coming from
people. It is loaded with feeling
and-a desire to make the news
relevant to the listener. It seems

Vvsnsyx. V: I \/ uuvux LIIk..

more real to me than a parade of
flat ‘faces and events marching
across the flat, flat world of the
television screen. If I am told
something by a friend, even if it
is just a bit of gossip, then I care,
but when Tom Brokaw tells me
something, I don't care.

Back to apathy. Obviously, the
elimination of the media is not
going to solve that problem. I
can't care about something
without having at least semi-

reliable information about it.‘

‘IKa\]KJ\/ §4 \(lI\AlIO\, ul ulg, vvu} Lulu;

the media works?

Not really. We have a choice
between the Dan Rather school
of news broadcasting, and the
Sally Wiggins school. We can
have an impersonal narrator relat-
ing a series of hard facts and pic-
tures, or a watery-eyed emoter
who just ”|oooves Pittsburgh”
and has a co-anchor with plastic
features, from his face down to

his hair. How are we, excuse me,
how am I supposed to deal with
this? On the one hand, Dan is so
emotionless that I can't bring my-
self to care what he is talking
about. ‘On the other, Sally is so
emotional that I can't bring my-

self to have anything but con— .

descension for her and what she
is reporting. ‘
Does anyone else out there
have this problem? Could,
perhaps, some of you apathetic
people get up and write a letter,
nu I--C, nu u-nyuiix, ill um. IIILKAILI, vi
to your cousin in Philadelphia,
about this? Is this some of why
you don't care? This is not a yes-
or-no answer. I couldn't tell you

for myself. |don’texpectanyone T

I'm just curious. It's not like I
care or anything.

Don’tdrink the water: 10 reasons to go to Penn State

Ten reasons to love State Col— I

lege and transfer to Penn State:

1. Penn Staters are a friendly
breed. Even after a hard night of
drinking, they seem to have the
time and energy to fondle and
mutilate each other in the streets
of State College.

Rarely do you not see a pair of
Lions grappling in the street,
maybe even banking each other
off cars; sort of like an impromp-
tu hockey game with your best
friend as the puck. Fun! Fun! Fun!

Must be something in the
mountain water.

2. If there is one thing I love,
it is standing in a 200-foot wait-
ing line outside of a bar, particu-
larly in the tropical November
breeze State College is famed for.

Even though Penn State has an
enrollment of approximately
40,000, everybody seems to
know each other and offer the
seemingly nonexistent spot in
front of them to a weary student
ailing for his first beer of the
evening. ‘I I

Ah, camaraderie.

3. Penn State merchandise is
everywhere. Should you happen
to lose your shirt or pants at a
party, you can run to the nearest
Uni-Mart and pick up a matching

MATT
MARTIN

set of PSU sweats, officially en-
dorsed by that living legend, Joe
Paterno. _

4- The campus is so large that
you can actually schedule your

I classes over an hour apart to al-

low yourself adequate time to
reach your favorite Paterno-
endowed hall and choose the
seat of your liking.

Imagine, if you will, the thrill
of waking up at 7 a.m. to walk to
the west end of campus for your
nine o'clock class, and then mer-
rily strolling to the east end for
your II o'clock sitting, enjoying
the Paterno cutouts in the win-

dow of each store along the way.

And this isn't just a one-time
thing. It happens each and every
day, sometimes well into the
evening.

A 12-hour day of classes. Eu-
phoria.

5. Beautiful strip mines sur-
round the outlying areas of State
College. The water has become
contaminated, but don't fret. In
Clearfield, hotel management
hands out bottled water, much
like you would find at the swank-
iest country club or Ivy League
schooL

They look out for your health
more than your mother ever
would. '

6. There are no police patroll-
ing the streets of State College as
they do in Oakland. Of course,
at Penn State, there is no crime
(or an ’O’). Everyone is whole-
some and caring.

I read in the campus paper that
Penn State students who have
visited Oakland are appalled at
the number of police officers and

Like it or lump it,George Bush

Well, I guess it's time to put
away my Dukakis-Bentsen
button.

. But being the optimistic person
I am, I guess I should look for-
ward to the 41 st presidency with
a minimal amount of grumbling,
even though my candidate lost.

_ After all, this is the most stable

country in the world when it
comes to the peaceful transfer-
ence of power.

Every four years, we go through
a political process that includes
emotionalism, hype, omnipresent
television and an awful lot of bal-
loons. This is certainly preferable
to military coups, rioting and var-
ious other ways people in some
countries choose to make their
political desires known.

President George Herbert
Walker Bush. Let's think about
this for a minute. His qualifica-
tions are certainly beyond
reproach, although it would have
been nice if the majority of his
appointments weren't merely as
a result of loyalty. Let's be honest:
Bush has spent much of his
career doing exactly what Presi-
dents Nixon, Ford and Reagan

Nixon debated two positions:
for Bush, ambassador to the Unit-
ed Nations and chairman of the
Republican National Committee.
Bush is fortunate that Nixon
chose to send him to the United
Nations. Othen/vise, he probably

MICHELLE
O‘BR|EN

would have suffered the conse-
quences with the rest of the RNC
Watergate bunch.

Loyalty complex or not, Bush,
his friends and the now-famous
”Bush kids" will indeed be in-
stalled at the White House on
Jan. 20. How will Bush choose to
guide the country?

One thing is certain (or is it?):
”no new taxes.” Bush would
have us believe that this means
exactly what it says, that at the
end of histerm in office, there
will not be one single tax that
doesn't currently exist. Period.

I have several questions about
this statement.

First, why would any politician
bind himself to such a mandate?
Even the best economists can't al-

-v-..A).; u\.\,\.4i<.u\,u, r/O\./\Al\,k Il'uI\,.\»Is4

tions in the national and world
economy. Does Bush, who
doesn't have a degree in econom-
ics (as far as I know), think he can
look into a crystal ball and know
beyond all doubts that absolute-
ly no situation requiring the tini-
est bit of an increase in revenues
to the federal government will
occur?

Of course he can't. But regard-
less of what happens economical-
ly, Bush has committed himselfto
that phrase, ”no new taxes.” To
violate this promise would be a
much bigger ”gaff" than any he
committed during the campaign,
like forgetting what day the
Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor.

By the way, one of my profes-
sors, who lives in Europe, told
our class that Bush's comment
that Pearl Harbor occurred on
Sept. 7, not Dec. 7, was splashed
over the front pages of several Eu-
ropean newspapers. The readers
of these newspapers must be im-
pressed with our choice of a
president, huh?

Second question: does no
new taxes" include no new in-
creases or decreases in any tax-

II

the snarling, bloodthirsty dogs at
their heels.

Consider that the only dogs
Penn Staters have ever seen are
that ever-loving Benji on the big
screen, prairie dogs and co—eds.
Must have been a big shock.

7. Penn State students can visit

. bars without ever worrying about
being bothered by an underage
drinker.

That's right. Every prospective
patron at every bar is checked for
positive I.D. If I weren't 21 al-
ready, I would transfer so’ I
wouldn't be instilled with the
drinking morals (or lack thereof)
that those Pitt people so proudly
display. -

8. Even those having parties in
their own apartments make sure
to uphold this tradition. A sign on
one door read ”You must be 21.
to drink‘ alcohol here. Positive
I.D. required. Alternative bever-

ages supplied for those under

21.”
Why don't we do that here?
9. If Penn State were not found

isournext

Bush’s intended cut in capital
gains taxes is out of the question.
Let's also not forget who is ac-
companying George Bush to the
White House: Dan Quayle.
Throughout the campaign,
Democrats ridiculed the idea of
Quayle as a leader and warned
voters of the possibility of a Presi-
dent ‘Quayle should anything
happen to our beloved President
Bush. -
Republicans retorted that thei
objections were ridiculous, Bush.
was in fine health and there was
nothing wrong with Quayle, any-
way. Besides, the Republicans
reminded us, the vice president
really doesn't have all that much
to do. He has almost no decision-
making power.
‘ Is this supposed to make me
feel better about Quayle? True,
vice presidents do spend a lot of
time going to funerals and other
less-than-glamorous state func-
tions. But these affairs are still im-
portant tests of American
diplomacy. A vice president or
anyone else representing the
country at any function must be
able to conduct himself tasteful-

inlthe rolling, wooded hills of
central Pennsylvania, there
would probably not be a town
named State College. If there's no
State College, the world ends.

‘I0. Joe Paterno is the classiest
guy this side of Tiny Tim. Pater-
no is ever optimistic, wearing
those high—cut polyester trousers
in case Beaver Stadium is’ ever
flooded. He is the epitome of
what glasses can do for certain
people's appearances. '

Were it not for Paterno, the
phone book industry would cer-
tainly flounder and fail. If not for
Paterno, there would be pictures
of Franco Harris in every store.

TJoePa makes his team wear
those boring blue and white uni-
forms so as not to take anything
away from opposing teams. What
a guy.

If not for Paterno, there would
be no Penn State. God forbid.

Matt Martin is a sports editor
for The Pitt News.

‘at   t
or does anyone else think that
maybe this just isn't Quayle’s
strongest point?

Then again, maybe he will do
a good job. -After all, he must
have learned something about
relating to people sensitively and
intelligently during all those cam-
paign stops at high schools.

Like it or not (and you proba-
bly have guessed I don't like it at
all), Bush and Quayle have the
next four years to take the coun-
try in the direction they see fit.

Thank goodness for Congress.
It did pick up a couple of
Democratic seats, didn't it?

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, November 14, 1988

By Erik Kridle

Staff Writer

Pittsburgh City Councilman
Mark Pollock said at an on-
campus lecture Thursday that
he expects the new district sys-
tem of council elections, start-
ingin 1989, to bring more
"high caliber” councilmen
into office than the ”at large”
system presently in use.

Pollock criticized the leader-
ship qualities of the present
council members.

”We have a council that
doesn't do our city proud,”
Pollock said.

Pollock called "at large’’
elections an ”incredibly pro-
found change in the method of
electing city council mem-
bers."

in the past, nine councilmen

council from a pool of candi-
dates from all neighborhoods
of the city in an ”at large"
election. Beginning in May,
one councilman from each of
the newly determined council
districts will be elected in a
”district” election.

According to Pollock, many
members of council are elect-
ed to several subsequent terms
in office for the simple reason
that their names are very
recognizable to voters.

Pollock said council mem-
bers _Michelle Madoff and
Gene De Pasquale are two of
the most recognizable names
in Pittsburgh.

"They’re back in office sim-
ply because their names are so
recognizable," Pollock said.

Pollock said new, smaller
districts of roughly 40,000
residents will make it much

easier for candidates to cam-
paign effectively. A lot less
money will need to be spent
by each of the candidates, he
said.

"The candidates will be
known by their neighbors,”
Pollock said. '’People will
have the opportunity to get to
know them a lot better.”

”District" elections will take
the government back to the
people and away from high-
powered media incumbents,”
he said.

Pollock said he is concerned
that council members elected
by the new system will have
the ”guts” to put the interests
of the city above the interests
of his or her neighborhood.

"l hope that those individu-
als will be able to transcend
their own interests and the
perpetuation of their own term

Pollock criticizes City Council members

in office,” Pollock said.

Pollock praised Pittsburgh's

many community interest
groups as the "best in the na-
tion.” These groups not only
work to revitalize and en-
hance their respective neigh-
borhoods, but they also come
together when another neigh-
borhood is in need, he said.
Pollock talks to the leaders of
many of these neighborhood-
based groups on a regular
basis. .-
’'I don't know all of the an-
swers,” Pollock said, ”but I
know where 0 to get the
answers.”

Many of the councilmen
currently in office will not be
re-elected in 1989's district
election, Pollock said. Two of
the incumbent candidates will
be forced to run against each
other, he said.

PITTSBURGH (AP) —
Manufacturers in Allegheny
County produced nearly 23 mil-
lion pounds of toxic pollution last
year, with USX Corp.’s Clairton
Works leading the list of sources,
according to reports filed for the
first time by the companies.

The reports are among 74,000
filed by firms across the nation
under the right-to-know provi-
sions of the new Superfund

passed the act in response to the

nies to report emissions of 328
toxic chemicals that are not regu-
lated by the federal government.
The maximum fine for failing to
file is $25,000. ’

The reports, which cover 57
plants operated by 49 Allegheny
County companies, describe
large releases into the environ-
ment of such chemicals as ben-
zene, which can cause leukemia;
xylene, which can damage the
liver and kidneys; and naphtha-
lene, which can irritate the eyes,
nose and throat.

The reports do not show what
levels of the chemicals people are
being exposed to, however. As a
result, public health authorities,
environmentalists and industry
officials say it is virtually impos-
sible to say what health risks the
releases pose.

”We're not aware of any chem-
icals that are causing health
problems, but we haven't done
the analysis we're beginning to
do now,” said Ronald Chleboski,
head of air pollution control for
the county Health Department.

The reports show the Clairton
Works produced nearly 6.1 mil-
lion pounds of toxicants last year,
more than a quarter of the
county-wide total. The plant
bakes coal in a network of ovens
to produce coke, an ingredient
used in steelmaking.

Philip Masciantonio, vice presi-
dent for environmental affairs for
USS, the steelmaking division of
USX, said the Clairton Works is
the nation's largest coke plant, so
it should be no surprise that its
toxic releases are the largest in
the county.

Stokes also served on such
committees as the House Ap-
propriations Committee, the
House Un—American Activities
Committee and the lran—Contra
Panel, which investigated the ac-
tions of Oliver North and John
Pointdexter, among others.

Stokes pointed out that his in-
auguration in 1969, in addition to
that of Shirley Chisholm and Wil-
liam Clay, marked the first time
since 1875 that more than eight
blacks served in the House of
Representatives (at the time of
Stokes’ inauguration, there were
six incumbents). Between 1900
and 1928, he said, there were no
blacks in Congress at all.

Stokes also addressed three
”plateaus" of black achievement
in American politics. The first, he
said, was the election of Carl
Stokes to mayor of the eighth lar-
gest city in the United States. ’’If
Carl Stokes can become the
mayor of Cleveland,” Stokes said,
”then [any black] can become the
mayor of Detroit, and Philadel-
phia, and Chicago, and other

ran throughout the afternoon,
during which companies offered
students jobs and internships.
Some of the companies there
were Johnson & Johnson, Pepsi,
AT&T and I-BM.

Myers said, ”That was wonder-
ful. The companies were very
helpful, beneficial and nice.”

Thursday night, Congressman
Louis Stokes told students about
his life, stressing the importance
of education. He also told the au-
dience that the black vote was
important, adding that only 22 of
the 435 congressmen in the

House of Representatives are _

black.
The last events of Black Week

were more socially oriented than

the earlier events. Friday was Ta-
lent Night, during which students
performed, and the Total Social
was on Saturday night.

Myers said that part of the suc-
cess of Black Week was that the
students were given insight into
politics and corporate America.

major cities around the country.”

The second plateau, according
to Stokes, was the the late Harold
Washington's election as the
mayor of Chicago, the third-
largest city in America.

Stokes said the third plateau
was Jesse Jackson's 1984 and
1988 presidential campaigns. In
1984, Stokes said, a black child
approached Jackson in Cleveland
and told him, ‘'1 didn’t know a
black man could run for president
of the United States.”

’’If Jesse Jackson's run for the
presidency did nothing else,”
Stokes said, ”but say to every
black youngster in America that
‘You, too can run for the highest
office in the land,’ Jesse would
have served "an excellent
purpose.”

Stokes concluded his speech
by commenting on the small au-
dience present. ”With the num-
ber of black students you have on
this campus, this room should be
full tonight. it's sort of like
church: You're preaching to the
ones who are there, but you need
to be preaching to thegones who
are not there.”

Number of child deaths
from parent abuse drops

By A.]. Hostetler

Associated Press Writer

PHILADELPHIA (AP) —
Although the number of Ameri-
can children dying from parental
abuse as reported by state agen-
cies dropped by 4 percent from
1986 to 1987, two social
researchers estimate that the ac-
tual number of children dying
through parental neglect or abuse
is closer to 5,000 a year.

”The disturbingly high number
of children dying unnecessarily
early is a serious national
problem,” according to Deborah
Daro and Leslie Mitchel of the
Chicago-based National Commit-
tee for the Prevention of Child
Abuse.

Mitchel presented their
research Saturday at the annual

Drugs __
Continued from page 3
William Booth said Friday.
However, Booth conceded, ”The
data does tell us we are a long
way from winning the war.”
In April, Mayor Tom Bradley,
a former police lieutenant, vowed
during the first 1,000—officer gang
task force sweep, ”We are going

to take these terrorists off the

streets of Los Angeles.’’

More than 21,000 people,

12,000 of them gang members,
have been arrested by the depart-
ment's gang task force since
February, most of them during
the highly publicized sweeps, in-
cluding one Saturday night that
netted more than 175 people.
Police said they do not know
how many arrests resulted in con-
victions.
I Next year's mayoral race be-
tween Bradley and his expected
challenger, Councilman Zev
Yaroslavsky, will certainly put the
focus on gangs again.

”Crime is the No. 1 issue on
everyone’s mind,’ Yaroslavsky
said Friday. ”The gangs in the city
have become the purveyor of
drugs to the nation.”

U.S. Drug Enforcement Ad-

ministration, FBI and Customs

agents recently joined the Police
Department and Sheriff's Depart-
ment in the gang battle. ”The Los
Angeles drug problem is not just
a local problem. Federal interven-
tion is absolutely essential,”
Yaroslavsky said.

In late October, gang violence
took an especially heavy toll. A
Cal State Long Beach football star
had a kidney removed after using
his body to shield a child from a
bullet at a Halloween party, and

10 people were wounded outside"

a Watts birthday party the same
weekend, including a 15-month-
old child who later died.

In south—centra| Los Angeles,
where the gangs are worst and
task force sweeps most frequent,
homicide is down 17 percent,
robbery down 4 percent and rape

‘down 5 percent in October com-

pared with a year ago.

Gangs, however, are simply
moving into other areas of the
city to ply their drug trade, Booth
conceded.

On the city's West Side, for in-
stance, there have been 20 murd-
ers through October compared
with 17 for the same period last
year. In the San Fernando Valley,
there have been 26 deaths com-
pared with eight through October
1987.

conference of the National As-
sociation of Social Workers in
Philadelphia.

According to the report, based
on an analysis of national figures
of child deaths officially listed as
caused by disease, accident and
suicide, an average of three chil-
dren a day were identified as fa-
tal victims of child abuse and
neglect in this country in both
1986 and 1987. Child fatalities
resulting from abuse jumped 25
percent from 1985 to 1987, and
preliminary figures for 1988
show the number is still growing.

In their study, Daro and Mitch-
el wrote that in most states, local
child ‘welfare agencies estimate
that the number of child deaths
in families known to them ranged
from 25 to 50.

THE PITT NEWS

By Matt Martin

Sports Editor

You might have called it a
defensive struggle — a repeat of
last year's Pitt—Penn State game at
Pitt Stadium.

You might have called it a cliff-
hanger, an edge-of—the—seat, hair-
pulling brawl on the natural grass
of Beaver Stadium.

Call it what you like, but call
it a 14-7 Pitt victory over the Nit-
tany Lions Saturday evening be-
fore a national viewing audience,
via ESPN, and a crowd of 85,701,
the sixth—|argest attendance figure
ever at Beaver Stadium.

Pitt's fourth consecutive victo-
ry pushed its record to 6-3 and
the team toward what is becom-
ing an elusive bowl situation,
while Penn State fell to 5-5 and,
with next week's game against
No. 1 and undefeated Notre
Dame, dangerously close to its
first losing season in 23 years un-
der coach Joe Paterno.

”One of the things I was think-
ing about coming up here was
our young players,” Pitt coach
Mike Gottfried said. ’’I was con-
cerned about the stadium here,
how we would play on the road
after seven home games. I felt that
if we could win this game up
here, it would be a giant step for
us.”

Lest you forget, this was a game
neither team could afford to lose
— ”This game is played like the
Super Bowl,” said Pitt freshman
linebacker Curtis Bray. With pos-
sible bowl bids waiting in the
wings and, above all, the oppor-
tunity to beat archrival Penn
State, Gottfried had reason to
worry about his young players.

-But it was the Panthers’ youn-
ger players — if they can indeed
be termed that after nine games
— that sealed Pitt's second victo-
ry over Penn State in as many
years.

Freshman tailback Curvin
Richards ran for 159 yards and
one touchdown, giving him
1,112 yards in five starts and
making him only the 24th fresh-
man in NCAA history to accumu-
late over 1,000 yards, and Bray
was credited with a safety on
Penn State's first possession of the
game.

The game may have been de-
fined by what could have been,
not what actually was. Quarter-
back Darnell Dickerson went
deep all night, but a tenacious
Lion secondary kept the ball just
beyond the fingertips of the Pan-
ther receivers.

”We could have made a cou-
ple of plays here and there if we
would have extended ourselves,”
senior flanker Billy Osborn said.

”We had a great game plan,
and we worked hard all week,”
said Richards. ”We wanted to run
against them and come up with
the big plays, the big passes.”

”We were just trying to set
something up,” offered Dicker-
son, who passed for 104 yards on
nine completions and ran for an
additional 62 yards.

”We had a couple of chances
to put it away early. You've got

to give the Penn State defense
credit,” Osborn added.

Paterno did just that, even
though Pitt racked up nearly 30
yards more than Penn State usual-
ly allows, thanks largely to Pitt's
272 yards on the ground.

”l thought we played solid
defense. We played hard against
a team that is a good offensive
team, particularly with the quar-
terback that they have.”

Pitt was ranked 15th in the na-
tion in total offense prior to the
game, averaging 450.9 yards per
contest.

Offensively, the Lions strug-
gled. Kicker Ray Tarasi missed
three field goals, one a blocked
attempt by Panther cornerback

Cornell Holloway.

The Panthers blocked two
Penn State field goal attempts in
their 10-0 win last year.

The Pitt defense held the Lions
to 22.0 total yards, only 106 on
the ground. That between seven
runners.

”l felt like our defensive line
must have played well,” Gott-
fried understated.

lf playing hard can be meas-
ured in penalties, then the two
teams should both be in the

hospital today. Five personal foul ‘

calls were levied, 13 total penal-
ties marked off for 124 lost yards.

Somewhere in between, Lions
quarterback Lance Lonergan
managed to throw three intercep-
tions,Sand the Lions fumbled the
ball away once. Pitt gave the ball
up on fumbles twice.

”There were a lot of mistakes
made today,” Gottfried said.
”Certainly there were a lot of
turnovers. We put ourselves in

Walker makes return
against Nittan y Lions

He didn't rush for what was
becoming his customary 100
yards, nor did he break the big
play that was rapidly becom-
ing his trademark.

But quietly -— and slowly -
tailback- Adam Walker
returned to the lineup in Pitt's
14-7 battleground victory over
Penn State. ‘

Walker ran for — er, rather
— lost four yards on four rush-
es in the third quarter as the
featured running back in his
first game back after a six-
week ankle injury layoff.

”The plays we ran really
didn't have anywhere for me
to go,” said the 6-foot-3,
192-pound Walker.

”The coaches told me we're
starting from A-1 again. Coach
Liggins [running backs_coach
Tommy Liggins] told me I'm
going to work double-time to
get back to where I left off,” he
added. A

Walker started the first four
games of the season, rushing
for 374 yards and five touch-
downs, but has - not played
since a 34-31 loss to Boston
College on Oct. 1.

Walker said.

He is still the third leading
rusher on the team, behind
freshman tailback sensation
Curvin Richards (1,091 yards)
and quarterback Darnell Dick-
erson (481 yards).

Panther coach Mike Gott-
fried was glad just to have
Walker back on the field.

”He did a pretty good job
for us,” Gottfried said, ”but It
was still very difficult for him.”

Walker expects to see more
time at North Carolina State
(Nov. 19) and Syracuse (Dec.
3), but noted that his talent
could not overtake the playing
time he's missed.

’’I listened to the coaches
and did what they said, but I
would have needed to play a
little earlier to be effective,”

thrash
Clarion

By Chris Bosak
Staff Writer

Pitt's women's swim team re-

mained undefeated by thrashing -

Clarion, 176-72, on Friday. The
Lady Panthers, now 3-0, won ev-
ery event and were never threa-
tened by the overmatched
Clarion team.

’’It was easier than I thought it

might be,” said Coach David Be-
lowich. ”We dominated, which
is what you want. It builds our
confidence for the upcoming Vir-
ginia meet.”
_ Pitt hosts the tough Virginia
team Saturday at 2:30 p.m. Vir-
ginia, which was ranked seventh
in the nation last year, is once
again ranked in the top 10 this
yean

Pitt boasted two triple winners
in the Clarion meet, Laurie Walc-
zak and Karin Masil.

Walczak, a junior, won the 50-
and 100-meter freestyle events
with times of :24.94 and :53.35,
respectively. The former All-
American Walczak also swam for
the victorious 400 medley relay
team, consisting also of Sandy Al-
bright, Noel Barry and Karin
Masil. Pitt also took second in the
event

Masil also won the 400 in-
dividual medley and the 200
breaststroke events. Her 2:22.98
time in the 200 breaststroke was
just one second shy of a school
record.

”She is swimming extremely
well, and she’s going to keep get-
ting better,” said Belowich.
”She’s very talented and will add

la lot to the program.”

Freshman Noel Barry also won
the 200 butterfly in a time of
2:13.16 to become a double
winner.

Janine Atiyeh, another fresh-
man, bounced back from a rela-
tively off performance against
Syracuse and won the 200 back-
stroke event.

”Janine is now becoming more
confident in the program,” said
Belewich. ”She will be a factor as
she gets more experience.”

Sophomore distance swimmer
Theresa Pickolo won the 500
freestyle event. Pickolo was
fourth in the Eastern United States
in the 500 free and mile events
last year.

”Theresa’s becoming extreme-
ly experienced and is definitely a
leader,” said Belowich. ”She
could be one of the best distance
swimmers Pitt ever had.”

Liz Sari and Celeste Makiel also
finished on top of their events.
Sari won the 1,000 freestyle, and
Makiel won the 200 freestyle.

Pitt also dominated the diving
events with Krissa Ratliff winning
the 1-meter and Margie Paulick
winning the 3-meter. Ratliff is a
junior transfer student from
Northern Michigan.

”With Krissa better on the
1-meter, and Margie better on the
3-meter, it gives us a nice com-
bination,” said Belowich.

Because of the lopsided score,
the rest of the events were swum
as exhibition.

”|t’s not a habit of mine to run
up the score on anybody,” said
Belowich.

STATE COLLEGE, PA — Notes
from Pitt's 14-7 victory over Penn
State last Saturday:

0 ’Swervin’ Curvin continues
to dazzle during his freshman
campaign. Richards dashed for
159 yards against the Nittany
Lions to up his season total to
1,091 yards. The amazing thing
about Saturday's game was that
Richards’ average was a whop-

ping 5.1 per carry.

the third quarter. On a run

At the beginning of the season,
the Philadelphia Eagles were be-
ing highly touted. They had a
mixture of youth and experience
on both offense and defense.
Coach Buddy Ryan had finally
turned the Eagles into a viable
contender: a team that should be
in the playoffs and could very
well take the NFC East title.

Well, things haven’t really
worked out the way it was
planned. The Eagles have been a
different team every week. They
have beaten teams like Houston
(7-4) and the Rams (7-4), but they

Last-second field goal
block lifts Eagles to
27-26 win over Steelers

have lost to teams like Atlanta
(3-8). *

Everything changed a little this
week as the Eagles used a field
goal by Luis Zendejas with 1:51
left in the game to defeat the host
Pittsburgh Steelers, 27-26.

’’It was a great win and a much
harder-fought game than I think
we were looking for,” Ryan said.
’’It might have been a different
game if our defense would tack-
le people. But, overall, I think we
played well.”

The win renewed the Eagles’
playoff h s and improved their
record 6-5. The Steelers
dropped farther into last place in
the AFC Central with a 2-9

record.
”We played well enough to
win, then to end up losing this

way is just the way things are go-
ing for us this year,” Steeler quar-
terback Bubby Brister said. ’’I
know if we keep playing hard,
we'll end up on the other end of
the stick.”

' The Steelers came out of the
locker room ready to play. The
defense held the Eagles to three
plays and forced a punt. Pitts-
burgh took the ball from their
own 39 to the Eagles’ 35, where

kicker Gary Anderson gave the g

Steelers a 3-0 lead.

The Steeler defense stayed
tough, allowing the Eagles one
first down and again f 'ng them
to punt. This time t. Steelers
were not to be held out of the end
zone. '

Running back Merril Hoge

ried

A almost single—handedly car

the Steelers to the Eagles’ 12, run-
ning four times in the six play
dri
N pulled out the old ”end-

around-pass-p|ay” and Louis ‘

Lipps hit Hoge with a 13-yard TD
pass. The Anderson extra point
gave the Steelers a 10-0 lead.

”They were just knocking our
butts off the line of scrimmage,”
Ryan said. ”They were knocking
our linebackers into the cond-

and we weren't tac ' g very
I. We let their rushing game
get the best of us.”

The Eagles started to come
back to life. The running game,
which had been stifled up to this
point, started to move thr h
the Steeler defense. On a ' t-
and-goal from the Steeler 1, run-
ning back Keith Byars took the
ball into the end zone. The Eagles
shortened the‘ Steeler lead to
10-7.

The touchdown opened up the
floodgates, as both teams traded
score after score during the sec-
ond quarter. It was the Steelers’
turn first. Anderson kicked his
second_ field oal of the game,
this time a —yarder.

The Eagles opened up a pass-
ing attack on an 80-yard drive.
Quarterback Randell Cunnin-
gham hit tight end Keith Jackson
four times for 48 yards, and it was
capped off with a 7-yard Cunnin-
gham run-and-dive into the end
zone. The Eagles moved ahead
for the first time in the game,
14-13.

”Once this offense gets started,

we k going,” Cunningham
said. ” e just have to start a lit-
tle earlier.”

The -Steelers came back and

the hole penalty-wise and with
some turnovers. You can't do
that. We had a chance to put the
game away a little earlier, and
Penn State made some great
plays.”

But those plays were few and
far between.

The Panthers opened the game
with three first downs on their
first possession but could not ad-
vance past the Penn State 41.
Yusef Washington's punt was
downed at the PSU 3-yard line.

Two plays and two yards later,
Lonergan found himself staring
Bray in the face in the end zone.
Instead of taking the sack and
resulting safety, Lonergan
chucked the ball towards the
Penn State student section, not a
receiver.

Intentional grounding was

called against Lonergan, and Bray-

was credited with a safety, the
first two points of his Pitt career.

”I went to hit him, and I
couldn't tell whether he threw it
or not. I grabbed his legs and I
wasn't sure if they said his knee
hit. I thought he threw the ball,’’

Bray said.

Pitt's lead wasn't threatened
until Tarasi attempted a 40-yard
field goal with 3:36 to play in the
first quarter.

The kick went wide right,

We had a great game
plan and we worked
hard all week- We
wanted to run against
them and come up with

passes.

however. Tarasi found himself on
the field three minutes later, but
his field goal attempt was
blocked by Holloway and reco-
vered by Bray on the Pitt 32.

Eleven plays later, the Lions
found themselves inside the Pitt

10, thanks in large part to a
38-yard pass completion from
Lonergan to David Daniels.

On third and goal from the
1-yard line, Sam Gash went over
the top, and the PAT gave Penn
State its only points of the game
and a 7-2 lead with 10:15 to play
in the second quarter.

Pitt answered on its next pos-
session, sending Richards around
left end for a 6-yard touchdown
run. The two-point conversion at-
tempt failed, and Pitt led 8-7 with
5:11 remaining in the half.

After a Penn State punt, Pitt
took over on its own 32. Dicker-

, son marched the ball upfield to

the PSU 22, where Richards
needed only 1 yard to surpass the
1,000 yard mark.

The Panthers apparently caught
the Lions in that mind-set as full-
back Ronald Redmon took the
ball for a 13-yard gain to the Penn
State 9.

On fourth and goal from the 1,
Scott Kaplan booted an 11-yard
field goal to give the Panthers all
the points they would need.

But Kaplan added another
three points at 9:31 of the third

be the final score.

Penn State mounted a furious

quarter with a 39-yard Tarasi field
goal attempt that fell wide left.

The Lions never threatened
again.

Both_ Frawley and MacAulay
gave strong accounts of them-
selves on defense as well.
Frawley led the match with 14

digs while MacAulay and team-
mate Michele Adamson each tal-
lied six blocks.

”Our blocking was one of the
keys to the match,” noted Pitt
coach Shelton Collier. ”We had
19 blocks for the match com-
pared to‘ six for Western Michi-

gan.”

Particularly encouraging to the
Lady Panthers was the strong
showing by middle—b|ocker
MacAulay.

’’It was one of Dee's best
matches of the year in one of the
real tough places to play.
Western Michigan always draws
large, enthusiastic crowds,” said
Collier.

In the other match held on Fri-
day evening, the seventh-ranked
I lnix/prcitv of Tova‘: at A_rlin0*nr\
squad took the minimum three
games to eliminate 18th-ranked
Arizona State.

On Saturday, Pitt met Texas-
Arlington for the tournament
championship.

In game one, the Lady Panthers
jumped off to a 13-6 advantage
before the team from Arlington
staged a furious rally which
turned Pitt away by a 16-14
score.

In the second game, the psy-
chological effects of the tough
loss in game one doomed the
Lady Panthers from the__ start, and
they were easily defeated 15-5.

Pitt opened up an 8-1 advan-
tage in the third game before
Texas-Arlington started to repulse
the Pitt attack. The game turned
into an epic struggle with the la-
dies from Texas claiming a hard-
fought 18-16 win over the Lady
Panthers.

Despite the loss, the Lady Pan-
thers showed they are a team
coming of age. Where earlier in
the year they were defeated han-
dily by top 10 teams, they are
now capable of giving that qual-
ity of team a scare and maybe
more.  .

”We played a great match
against Texas-Ar|ington,” as-
sessed Collier. ”We played even
with the seventh-best team in the
nation. We led in digs 34-33,
blocks 12-7, and our top two hit-
ters outhit their two leading
hitters.” V

The leading gunslingers on the
attack for Pitt against Texas-
Arlington were Frawley and
Sheils. Frawley led both teams
with 18 kills while Sheils con-
tributed 12. .

”Denise played a match wor-
thy of All-American considera-
tion,” noted Collier.

In spite of the loss, things are
looking up for the 20-8 Lady Pan-
thers. They have started playing
their best volleyball of the season
and will go into the Big East tour-
nament at Fitzgerald Field House
as heavy favorites to capture the
title before the home crowd.

Despite the 20-win season, the
Pitt contingent is in a real cat fight
for one of the NCAA Tournament
at large tournament bids. The Big
East champion will not be as-
sured an invitation.

There are approximately six

.teams fighting it out for two or

three spots in the tournament
field. Notre Dame, Oklahoma,
Iowa, Minnesota and Colorado

A are the other contestants attempt-

ing to woo the NCAA Selection
Committee.

”We have to win the Big East
this weekend and beat Texas-
Arlington in Dallas over Thanks-
giving weekend to be considered
for the NCAA tournament. I think
playing Texas-Arlington so close,
this weekend, we have the con-

fidence to go down there and

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, November I4, I988

Steelers

Continued from page 14
Anderson kicked his third field
goal of the game (a 29-yarder).
The half ended with the Steelers
up, 16-14.

”I think we played well during
the first half,” Noll said. ”We
were able to move the ball. They
were just able to counter every-
thing we did.”

The Eagles’ offense was led by
Jackson with eight catches for 85
yards and Cunningham's 276
yards passing.

”I like this offense,” Oklahoma
graduate Jackson said. ”We don't
run the wishbone and I get to
catch the ball a lot. We have a
good, strong and tall quarterback
here who can make things hap-
pen. We started playing better
last week, and it has continued
this week.”

Hoge rambled for 102 yards
and Brister threw for 226, but the
Steelers’ saving hope was four
Anderson field goals that kept
them in the game.

”We ran the ball well against
their defense,” Hoge said. ’’I
broke a few tackles and felt that
I was running hard.”

The Eagles took the lead early
in the second half on a Zendejas
field goal, but the Steelers an-
swered with an 89-yard TD pass
to Lipps.

”The wind inside the stadium
didn't seem to bother them,"
Ryan said. ”We were in a three-

deep zone, and they threw a"

100-yard touchdown pass.”

There wasn't any more scoring
in the third quarter, but Cunning-
ham was able to keep the Eagles
Up. The auarterbaek continually
got the Eagles out of trouble and
scored his second touchdown of
the game on a 12-yard run early
in the final stanza.

The teams traded a couple of
punts before the Steelers were
able to go back on top with a
41-yard Anderson field goal. But
the visitors were not done yet.

With 2:59 left and on their own_

28-yard line, Cunningham took
the offense into a two minute

drill. He started with a few short
passes, then on a third-and-10
with under two minutes to go,
Cunningham hit Cris Carter for
41 yards. Three plays later,
Zendejas kicked the winning
field goal.

”I really don't remember what
play the long pass to Carter was,”
Cunningham said. ”I saw Cris
take off down the sidelines, and
I saw that hand go up, which I see
every play that he runs a pass
route, and I gave it all I got and
bombed it to him. Somebody hit
me, and all I saw was Cris going
up for the ball.”

The Steelers were not about to
give up. They started with the ball
at their own 20-yard line and
made it all the way to the Eagle
38 with four seconds left. Just
enough time to kick a winning
field goal.

But it was not to be. Philadel-
phia defensive lineman Clyde
Simmons broke through the line
and blocked the ball on the way
up. The game ended with Pitts-
burgh holding their heads.’

”I’ll tell you what, contrary to

what a lot of people think, this .

Steeler team is not that bad,” Ea-
gles defensive end Jerome Brown
said. ”Not our players, but I
heard people saying things like,
‘My sister can go in and beat the
Steelers.’ I look at it this way; if
they weren't good players they
wouldn't be in the NFL. Any
team in the NFL can beat anyone
else. No matter what the records
might say.”

Men's swim team looks ahead to
Virginia during Clarion demolition

By Scott Campbell
Staff Writer

The men's swimming team
posted an impressive 161-82 vic-
tory over Clarion State Friday as
the Panthers improved their dual
meet record to 3-0.

However, this was a meet that
Pitt was admittedly looking past.
That is because this Saturday, Pitt
will meet Virginia at Trees Pool
in one of their most important
dual meets this year. ‘

Against Clarion, men's swim-
ming coach Dick Bradshaw used
many swimmers in events in
which they had not yet swum this
year.

”Peop|e swam in their second
or third events rather than their
topline events. We were trying to
not swim our best events so that
we can be ready for Virginia next
week. V

”When you have a tough meet,
you don't want to swim real hard
in your best events the week be-
fore. You get a little stale when
you swim the same event over
and over again,” Bradshaw said.

Virginia finished 21st in the
country last year, and a victory
over the Cavaliers Saturday
should give Pitt some national
recognition.

”Virginia is a respectable team,
and if we get by them, we have
a shot at being undefeated this
year,” Bradshaw said.

So Pitt chose Clarion as a team
to ”rest” against. The Golden Ea-
gles are Division II team,
although a good Division II team,
having finished third in the coun-
try last year; and they have won
several National Championships
in that division.

”Clarion is a very good Divi-

sion II team; however, being a
national-championship-caliber
Division II team doesn't compete
with a Division I team if you're
one of the top 30 teams in the na-
tion, which is where I think we
can end up by the end of the
year,” Bradshaw said.

Pitt won 10 of the 13 events,
several using with ”substitute”
swimmers.

For instance, freshman Eric
Daum won the 1,000-meter
freestyle, an event in which he
has not raced in competition this
year. Daum easily beat teammate

Daniel Langan by more than 18
seconds, and the nearest Clarion
swimmer was more than 30 se-
conds behind. .

Also, Fred Constantini won the
500 freestyle with a time of
4:44.48, an event in which he
had not yet raced. Constantini
also won the 400 individual med-
ley in 4:17.49.

Most of the other swimmers
had less luck with their new
events, however.

Most notably, Scott Jeffries, a
co-captain and one of Pitt's best

short—distance swimmers, swam
in the 500 freestyle, much longer

than what he normally swims.

Jeffries started out great, but
faded quickly. He finished last in
the race and received much rib-
bing from teammates for doing
so.
Pitt did use some familiar faces
in several events however, in ord-
er to ensure a victory.

Mike Kozlina won the 200
backstroke again, this time bv

nearly 11 seconds. J

Bill Folger continued to im-
prove, winning the 100 freestyle
in 48:05, an event in which he
finished second last week against
St. Bonaventure.

’’Bill is starting to come down
in times. He's a big boy and it
takes a little longer for taller guys
to taper,” Bradshaw said.

In addition, the diving team,
led by John Sharkey, easily won
their two events. Sharkey won
both the 1—meter and 3—meter

events, and Pitt took the top three
places in each event.

Michael Naylor finished sec-
ond to Sharkey in the 1-meter by
less than one point,
280.88—280.l3, despite having
worked out for only a few days.
He was a last-second replace-
ment for the event.

”l hadn't planned on using him
because he's been sick for the last
two weeks, but he did great,”
said diving coach Julian Krug.

In other events, the team of
