”Roads suck anyway; we need more grass!” screams a sign attached to
a crane removing the barriers on Bigelow Boulevard last night.

Rally shifts gears as
Bigelow reopens

Puss Krebs and Beth Fisher

   

Although there were little more
than 100 people gathered at Bigelow
Boulevard early in the morning, some
supporters of the closing were willing to
take action for what they believed in.

Standing amidst a smoky haze, stu-
dent Tom Kivowitz pledged his support
for the closing.

“I’ll do my job to bring more grass
to Oakland,” he said. “Tomorrow mom-
ing, we all ought to just sit down and
make a human chain —— handcuff people
from one meter to the next meter, all the
way across.”

Kivowitz’s friend, Paco, who was-
n’t coherent enough to give a last name,
was a little more radical in his views. He
feels “we can blow some shit up”in
order to keep Bigelow closed,

Other students echoed the spirit of

- his proposal, if not the exact measures.

“It’d be nice to keep it closed  and
ifI get arrested in the process, oh well,”
said Pitt student Dave Olof.

Student Environmental Action
Coalition sponsored the rally, and mem-
ber Jed Meltzer disagreed with the radi-
cal approach suggested by Olof.

“We don’t feel that blocking traffic

would be a useful tactic,” he said.

During the rally, which was spon-
sored by SEAC, member Kristina
Corvin encouraged those gathered to
show their support by contacting coun-
cilrnen and calling the Bigelow Closing
Hotline.

“The most important thing is that
we’re raising awareness,” said Corvin.
“If there’s enough of us, we can change
something.” V

Mark McCall, a member of Pitt’s
African Drumming Ensemble, which
performed at the rally, also believed the
event was raising awareness.

“We did it for support of the clos-
ing, as well as for exposure,” said
McCall.

His ensemble was joined by local
acts like PSOAS, Sasquatch, Avalon,
Grappa, and the Vifitch Babies.

“Most of the bands have at least one
Pitt student in them,” explained Corvin.
She said all of the bands played for free,
and SEAC’s only cost for the rally was
$80 for sound equipment.

Around 8 p.m., city trucks began
removing barriers from the street.
Between bands, SEAC member Kari
Hemquist announced that the Forbes
Avenue end of the block was just about

Political advertisers take the
gloves off as election nears

Sharon Friedman

 

The gloves are off, and the nega-
tive attacks are on. Political ads are
throwing the punches, and candi-
dates are fighting for the youth vote.

This week, which follows the
first official debates, ’ ’
political advertise-
ments have become
specifically targeted
at the 18 to 29-year-
old vote.

—“The ad war
really kicked off a week ago
Monday,” says David Peeler, general
manager of CNN’s consultant,
Competitive Media Reporting.
“That’s when the significant spend-
ing levels have started to pick up
and where we’ve notice it.”

The most recent Clinton ad tar-
gets Dole’s wafﬂing college scholar-

 

  

ship and medicare issues. The ad is a
Dole quote explaining how he want-
ed to “give children a chance in life,
give them an education,” followed

by another sound bite in which Dole

calls for the elimination of the
Department of Education.
Still another sound bite has Dole
’ saying he would pre-
serve medicare, con-
trasting a statement he
made against the pro-
gram. '
Previous to this
week, there were few
negative attacks from either party,
but Peeler said all that has changed.
“In reality, both sides are now
negative, and last week the Dole
side escalated the ad war, tripling
the volume of its TV ads,” he said.
Clinton’s positive advertising
strategies offer specific numbers on

BAGHDAD, Iraq —— The fighting
amongst the Kurds continues as the
Patriotic Union of Kurdistan
claimed new gains in Northern Iraq
on Monday. They claim to be
marching closer to Irbil, a major
city in Northern Iraq which is
secured by Iraqi tanks.

Both the United States and Iraq
agree on one thing —— the Kurds
need to end their feuding. This new
fighting is in the same place as
when Iraq stepped in and the
United States attacked Saddam
Hussein’s forces. Associated Press

NEW YORK —— The Dow Jones
Industrial Average crossed the
6,000 point for the first time in its
history on Monday. The believed
cause of this surge is the savings
that baby boomers are receiving in

believe that by buying stocks, this
group is going to do for the stock
market what it did for the real

buying homes in the early 1980s.

SACRAMENTO, California -—
An eight-year—old boy purposely
shoplifted in a grocery store to get
noticed by police on Monday and
get them to find his mother’s dead
body at his house. The boy and his
sister spent two weeks hiding in
their home, too scared to call for
help, while their mother’s body
decomposed in the closet.

The police are searching for the
boy’s father, Robert Castorena, on
suspicion of stabbing his wife to
death. The police view him as very
dangerous and feel he could be
anywhere in the country by now.

You won’t hear anything negative
coming out of Joe Preston’s mouth any-
time soon; he says he doesn’t believe in
negativity.

Preston, who has been the state repre-
sentative in the 24th Congressional District
for 14 years, spoke at the University
Democrats’ meeting last week about being
an elected official and about having a pos-
itive attitude.

“I’m a natural motivator,” said the
enthusiastic Preston. “I don’t believe in
failure.”

He grew up in Vandergrift and became
very involved with the Young Democrats
of Allegheny County. It was there that he
saw what it took to be an elected official.

In his speech, he stressed how impor-
tant it is being a state representative, and
how difficult it is at the same time. He is a
man who is always trying to eliminate the
margin of error.

“The challenge of an elected official is
to be perfect,” said Preston, who votes
5,000 times a year at the state’s House of
Representatives. “I pray that these deci-
sions I make don’t hurt anyone.”

Preston pointed out how important it
is to vote in the upcoming elections.
Whether it be the chairs we sit on in class,
or taxes we pay every year, Preston says
government is directly involved in our

UD speaker: politics isn't a game

lives.

“A lot of the funding for this school
comes from the state,” said Preston, “and if
you don’t vote, you don’t have a say in that
matter.” :

He also pointed out some rnisconoep—
tions about the Pemisylvania House of
Representatives. He spoke of how govem—
ment is not like a game, but more like a
business. According to Preston, it is a place
where intelligent and respectful insults are
brought out.

“We don’t take things personal there,”
said Preston, “and outside those doors we
talk about everything but politics.”

Preston is involved with everything
from the Board of Trustees at his church to
the State Licensing Board. He said that his
involvement in these various boards and
committees makes him a busy person.

If he had to do it over again, he
believes that he would try to focus more on
individuals, because he thinks he is spread-
ing himself too thin.

Preston doesn’t make political
promises and doesn’t trust people who do.
“I’m more interested in hearing your ideas
and thoughts,” said Preston. “Especially
yours, as students and the future of our
country.”

He emphasized how you don’t always
have to be elected to be involved in poli-
tics. “You can become involved in cam-
paigns, or you can just simply vote,” said
Preston. ‘

cleared, and the audience responded with
boos and jeers.

Over and over, SEAC members took
to the microphone and begged students to
take action. But despite all the urging,
apathy was still widespread among
bystanders.

When asked whether she would call
the hotline, Pitt student Heather Daniel
said, “I’d think about it, but I’d probably
never do it.”

Another part of Pitt’s status quo was
Thad Pawlowski, who wasn’t even sure
that the road should close. “I don’t think
it makes a difference, really,” he said.

One group of onlookers was in favor
of the closing, but was doubtful that it
would happen.

“It would take a couple of really

* motivated people [to close the road per-

manently],” said Joe Bly, one of these
students. He added, however, that he did-
n’t feel Pitt has any such leaders.

To some students, the closing is still
a safety issue.

“I know in a couple of days I’m
going to be crossing the street and get
smacked by a car because I’m not paying
attention,” said Pitt student Brian
Canigan.

Safe or not, Bigelow Boulevard is
officially reopened. Whether it will
remain that way in the future depends in
part on the support of Pitt students.

the assistance they provide to the
elderly. The Medicare program, as
it is in place currently, does not pro-
vide coverage for such things as
eyeglasses, dental care, or prescrip-
tion drugs.

“We ought to try and see how
we can help and assist our seniors
deal with those issues rather than
taking away the coverage and pro-
tections that senior citizens have
right now,” said Kennedy.

Kennedy said the Democratic
party is uniting on Capitol Hill over
Social Security and Medicare, much
like the Republicans had united in
their “Contract for America” bid.

“We are bringing everyone

together... all over this country are
those of us who are strongly com-
mitted to Social Security and to
Medicare,” said Kennedy.
“[Congress is] getting together and
is talking about where we might

go-”

Congressman Coyne said
Senator Kennedy’s speech high-
lighted “the importance of protect-
ing Medicare, an issue of great con-
cern, even for today’s younger vot-
ers.”

Because increased funding is
necessary to support aging members
of the “baby boom” generation,
younger people must acknowledge

the need for programs like

 

Medicare and Social Security,
according to University Democrats’
President Paul McKrell.

“We have to think about our-
selves, but we also have to think
about the implications for our
grandparents, for our parents,
because one day we are going to
have to take care of them,” McKrell
said.

Because they’re the ones paying
into into Social Security, McKrell
said students should support the
program so that it is around when
they are older.

“It is critical that [college stu-
dents] vote for a Democratic con-
gress and vote for President Clinton

if we-want to see these programs
that we have fought so hard for
maintained,” he said.

Faye Malarkey, one of the
event’s organizers, said she was
excited about Kennedy’s message
because it contributed a lot of ener-
gy to voters.

“Senator Kennedy is a figure in
American politics that crosses the
generational gap,” said Rob Frank,
vice—president of the .University
Democrats. “His visit will serve to
motivate both young and old in this,
the most important election of the
century.”

 

Ads

the president’s accomplishments in
the last four years. For example, he
cut the deficit by 60 percent and
opened a $10,000 tuition credit for
college with a $1,500 tax credit.
Clinton’s catchphrase is “bridge

   

I to the 21st century,” and it is sup-

posed to center around his dedica-
tion to education, college loans, and
fighting drugs —— all important
youth issues. However, the presi-
dent’s more recent ads try to point
out that Dole is not on the youth
side.

Dole’s ads have become just as
negative as Clinton’s with the latest
Dole ad trying to peg Clinton as
being “too liberal.”

The Dole ad attacking Clinton
on the drug issue uses a clip from a
Clinton MTV interview in which he
says he would inhale marijuana
smoke if he tried it again. The ad
makes the accusation that “cocaine
and heroin use among teenagers has
doubled” since Clinton took office.

Dole’s ads try to present him as
someone who has a vision that he
wants to achieve for all voters, espe-
cially the youth of the country.

“It’s about America,” Dole says.
“It’s not my America, It’s ‘your
America  I want young people to
have the same challenges andthe

. same opportunities and success as I

did.”

Perot, on the other hand, has
maintained a steady positive-ad
campaign. His latest commercials
attacked the decision of the
Commission on Presidential
Debates for excluding him.

However, the only marketing he
has done to promote himself to the
young voter is his interview with
Tabitha Soren on MTV and his web
page on the internet.

Perot is scheduled to have a
series of infomercials air in a few
weeks introducing the platforms that
he intends to support if elected.

IIIHVIEWS

Benefits need to be
revised and redone

Yesterday, Senator Edward Kennedy spoke in Pittsburgh
while campaigning for Democratic candidates.

His choice of topics was well-considered. The Senator
from Massachusetts came to one of the oldest counties in the
nation and spoke about Social Security and Medicare, calling
them some of the ﬁnest things the country had ever done.

These programs were originated to help senior citizens
who could no longer support themselves pay for the necessities
of life, including medical care. These programs have since
become our largest entitlement programs and are topics of
debate in nearly every national election.

_ These programs, as originally conceived, were a good idea
They ought not to be sacriﬁcial lambs for a balanced budget.

Instead, the programs should be overhauled. The first step
toward improving these programs is means testing, which is
determining whether someone has the means to live without
social security.

Currently, everyone meeting the minimum age for social
securitycancollectacheck, whetherornottheyneedit. So,
senior citizens and those who are eligible for beneﬁts for other
reasons can collect money from the federal govermnent even if
they are millionaires.

Thestandardargunrentisthatthesepeoplepaidintothe
program, so they should be able to get back the money they put
into it. This ignores how Social Security actually works.

Social Security is not a savings program. People do not pay
money into it so that they can collect it later. Ifthat were the case,
the interest on the accounts alone could eliminate the costs asso-
ciated with the program. Instead, today’s Social Security checks
are paid for by those paying Social Security taxes now. It is our
way of contributing to those who have gone before us.

Those millionaires who made their money off the backs of
the workers who are now dependent on Social Security because
their pension funds have gone under should not be collecting
money from the same pool as those same workers. Let them live
off the savings and wealth they’ve amassed throughout the
years.

Real changes need to be made in the entitlement programs,
but this is not cause for their elimination. What needs to be elim-
inated from the programs are the leeches who don’t truly need
them.

This column will not descend
into the post-ferninist darkness of
man bashing; however, it will pose a
pertinent question. Where are they
now? The MEN, I mean I have read
statistics which put the ratio at seven
women to every one man (you guys
should be ecstatic with delight). We
haven’t had any major wars for a
while, and I don't think the feminists
have gone so far as to start actually
exterrninating men in some strange
and sinister manner, although it is
my understanding that this strategy
was once considered justifiable retri-
bution.

Where have all the men gone?
Jail seems a good possibility, but we
must ask ourselves, do we want
these kind of men? And then again
(okay, a tiny bit of bashingz), look at
some of the sony ass examples of
the men your women friends are
with. Controlling if not actually vio-
lent, silent if not actually morose,
sexually uptight if not actually puri-
tanical, or stupid if not actually
retarded. So it turns out, we don’t
want very many of the men we do
see. So now what? Have a lobotomy,
perhaps.

Plainly, this is problematic for a
majority of women. Not only that,
but it’s downright ironic for this gen-
eration to be left high and dry, so to
speak, since we were all raised in the
shadow of those damned hippies
who made love and not war. So, hav-
ing decided that whatever gets you
through the night is all right, it now
turns out that it isn’t, ha ha, because
there aren’t any men!

I personally do not know one
guy in my age group who is a) sin-

gle, b) straight, and c) my ideal man.
Maybe I am a bad example, since I
am a) a cynic, b) a perfectionist, and
c) a born again virgin. Now, on the
other hand, I have tons of attractive,
together women friends who fall into
other age groups and who may con-
ceivably have a less totalitarian out-
look than I do (in my own defense, I
assure you that I have not arrived at
this viewpoint without doing consid-
erable research into, um, alternative
positions). What I mean is, regard-
less of age group, we are all sitting
around at happy hour, wondering
where the men are. Not here, evi-
dently.

What I have discovered through
my own painstaking and sometimes
onerous research is that women, on
the whole, regardless of outlook, do
not do well with casual sex. This trait
is extremely annoying to all con-
cerned, especially ourselves. It’s
those damned feelings again. We are
all post—’60s adults here, and we
thought we were supposed to go
around having nice, casual, non-
problematic sex with other consent-
ing adults. Everyone ends up healthy
and happy, right? Wrong. Turns out
those damned feelings like nothing
so much as physical contact so they
can start going haywire and ruining
one’s life with embarrassing scenes
and tearful recrirninations. In short, a
total nightmare for all concerned
(e.g., the guy, his wife, his mistress,
his little bit on the side, and one of
the other four women he is “dat—
ing”).

To date or not to date, that is the
question. My sister-in—law insists
that I accept every date that I am
offered, reasoning (not unreason-
ably) that even if I shudder at the

thought of him, he might have a '

Where have all the good men gone?

friend I like, not to mention provid-
ing all those other goods and ser-
vices at which men often excel (e.g.
vehicle maintenance, reaching the
light fixture above the stairwell,
investigating bumps in the night, and
paying for drinks and dinner). Only
trouble is that I am just no good at
ripping guys off for goods and ser-
vices unless I already think they are
so adorable that I am ripping their
clothes off and not caring in the least
about the goods and services any-
way. Maybe I am just old fashioned.

My other (ex) sister-in-law, on
the other hand, is an expert at this
kind of “dating.” She receives
leather jackets, diamond bracelets,
and trips to Barbados for Christmas,
all without even kissing the poor
mug in question! I was going to
interview her for this article, with a
view to publishing a “How to Use
‘em and Lose ‘em (no—exchange-of
body-ﬂuid—method)" advice column,
but she just married a guy she
unabashedly describes as “ugly but
reliable.”

A rather depressing prospect in
my view, however, but at least she
has found that rarest of commodi-
ties: a real live man. In lieu of find-
ing such a treasure, I just remember
that not having a man does in fact
have several advantages a) you’re
free, b) you can’t get pregnant, and
c) I can’t think of c right now. Of
course, all of these could be disad-
vantages, too. Well, whatever.

So, somewhere between a lobot- .

omy and man-bashing there must be
a happy medium. Personally, I think
it would be something like this: grab
your degree and get the fvvk out of
Pittsburgh.

p.n taylor still hasn’t found what
she is looking for.

Tennis serves up big comeback win

 

Better late
than never?

 

On Monday night, Midnight
Madness gripped college campuses
from New England to California.
Bands played, students shouted, and
the 1996 hoops season opened. The
next day, some students missed class-
es.

Pitt didn’t participate. Our version
was held last night. when Bigelow
Boulevard Madness gripped the cam-
pus from the 7—Eleven to the Cathedral
lawn. Bands played, a student or two
shouted, and a street re—opened. Today,
some students will be nearly-missed
by automobiles on their way to classes.

Somehow, we drew the last pick in
the early-week activity pool. While
some schools made the ESPN high-
light reel, Pitt ended up on the local
news, competing for time with
Madonna’s baby.

Deprived of an early Tuesday
corr1ing—out party, the Panther hoops
squad instead opted for a Tuesday
afternoon Media Day. Bands didn’t
play, no students shouted, and the only
things opening were reporter’s note-
books.

Chad Varga had some monster
dunks, but nobody cheered. Mark
Blount made a three-point shot, and
only the reporters in attendance were
on hand to gasp. Five-foot-seven
dynamo Chris Gardella played in the
paint for a few seconds during one of
the drills, and nobody called the
Guiness Book of World Records.

Other college hoops fans have
already been exposed to their basket-
ball programs, either by media cover-
age or personal attendance at a
Midnight Madness. While the Panthers
are only 12 hours behind in terms of
practice time, they are a month behind
from a public relations standpoint. No
real Pitt hoops publicity will be gener-
ated until the Marathon Oil exhibition,
scheduled for Nov. 15th.

The Pitt tennis team
rallied after dropping two
straight matches to defeat
a very strong Division I
Bucknell team at the Cost
Center, 5-4.

The Panthers had pre-
viously lost close matches
to Robert Morris College
and to Bloomsburg, both
with scores of 5-4.

“Robert Morris and
Bloomsburg were as close
as they could get, which
made Bucknell a reward-
ing victory,” Head Coach
George Dieffenbach said.

Earlier this season,
the tennis team had been
completely dominating
their opposition. They
shut out both St. Francis
and Clarion 9-0, and
defeated Mount St.
Mary’s 8-1.

The team plays a nine-
point format, which
means that there are six
singles matches and three
doubles matches. After
the singles competition
against Bucknell, the
Panthers were trailing 4-
2. Pitt needed to sweep
the doubles competition
to pull out a win, and they

did just that.
“I’ve been here for 22 Shalbrack,
years, and I never saw

Dieffenbach said.

Hoffman and freshman
Lauren Smith. Tamara
Kalesnik and freshman
Alison Bucher then
clinched the win for the
Panthers with an 8-6
score, while the team had
been down 5-4.

“I was really nervous
out on the court,” Bucher
said. “But at the same
time I was really excited.
We were all really happy
with the final outcome of
the match, including
George.”

“It was the true defin-
ition of pressure, espe-
cially following the two
losses,” Dieffenbach
said.” The players that
lost in singles came back
strong for us in the dou-

  bles competition.”

The look in Chad Varga’s eyes
said it all.

It didn’t matter that this was
only the first practice of the year —
the season opener against lllinois
State isn’t until Nov. 24, but that
wasn’t evident in Varga’s eyes.

As he led the 1996-97 men’s
basketball team during warm-ups,
it’s evident that the incredibly
intense Varga is ready to turn Pitt
around after a disappointing 10-17
record last season.

Varga led Pitt in consistency
last season, averaging 12.5 points
and 6.3 rebounds per game. His
presence and intensity are a given,
but the keys to this year’s success
may lay with second-year players
Mark Blount and Vonteego
Cummings.

   

Senior forward Chad Varga will lead a
young Panther squad trying to rebuild.

“Last year, we were at the bot-
tom,” said 7-foot center Mark

Willard’s troops prep
for tough uphill battle

Blount, who added 15 pounds of
muscle to his frame. “We’re gonna
work our way up.”

Blount’s numbers from last
year were far from stellar. He aver-
aged 3.6 points per game and 2.9
rebounds to go along with 27 blocks
(1.0 per game) as his play improved
throughout the year. It should be
noted that very few freshman cen-
ters have excelled immediately in
the Big East.

Cummings will take over the
point guard spot this season, after
playing two-guard last year.

“All my life, I’ve been playing
point,” Cummings said. “I’m not
scared at all.”

Cummings’ attitude reﬂects the
feelings of the rest of the team, a
team that most magazines and pub-
lications have already written off as
a lower-level Big East squad.

“People ﬁgure we’re not strong
enough and can’t play,” Blount said.

I)’,

On Saturday, the Pittsburgh Crew team
geared up for another rowing event of their
fall season. This time it was their First Annual
Row-A—Thon. Around 10 a.m., seven eight-
person boats took to the Allegheny and began
a 20—mile row. .

One boat came from Carnegie Mellon
University, two from Duquesne and the
remaining four consisted of Pitt Crew mem-
bers. Each boat had a combination of men
and women, novice and varsity.

Beginning at the foot of the channel next
to the Three Rivers Rowing Association
boathouse, the boats rowed down to the
Point, where the three rivers come together.
From there they continued up the Ohio
where the boats congregated again, rowed up
the Monongehela, and ﬁnished up by retum—
ing to the Three Rivers boathouse.

On the retum to the boathouse, the
coaches tried to keep the boats together by
having them speed up or slow down. Then a
bellowing, “Go!” emerged from one of the
coach’s mouths and all seven boats had a fun,
competitive row until they reached the
boathouse.

“There’s always a barrier between the
men, women, novice, and varsity, whether it
is imagined or legitimate. This kind of event

But every event has it drawbacks. For
instance, rowing for three—and-a—half—hours
straight without bathroom privileges is diffi-
cult to handle, but the Pitt rowers made due.
To complicate matters worse, in mid—row, a
huge boat whizzed by the seven boats and
created a huge wake for them to try to row
through. Huge waves crashed against the
backs and sides of rowers, but they pulled
through and ﬁnished the 20 mile row.

This event was held to raise money for
the team to buy a new boat. 56 rowers each
raised $100, and 10 more raised over $200.
The ﬁnal ﬁgures weren’t in, but it is estimat-
ed they eamed between $7,000 and $8,000.

Unfortunately, a few rowers were
unable to make it to the Row—A-Thon on
Saturday. These rowers have the pleasure of

Upperclassmen already know the
excitement of Panther basketball: the
feeling of a crammed fieldhouse, the
ear-splitting wonder of the Pitt Band
horn section playing in an enclosed
space, the upsets, the close games,
and Panther Paul during the timeouts.

Truly, a magical experience.
Maybe it can’t be compared to a street
opening, but it has its own special
charm.

Freshmen don’t know any of this
yet, and were deprived of a learning
experience when Midnight Madness
went the way of the Baltimore
Orioles. Without the late—night antics,
freshman fans are bound to assume
that Pitt hoops games will have all the
excitement of this year’s football con-
tests.

While few attended the media
session, one thing was clear to all
who did show —— Ralph Willard’s
hoops squad will be fun to watch.
More fun than Pitt vs. Ohio State, at
least. Even without the crowds and

enough of a spectacle to.outrank all
but a few football games this year.

The sparse crowd got to see sixth-
man Jason Maile make picture-per-
fect three—pointers from all over the
building. They were treated to a two-
on—two drill that featured Blount’s
first of many blocks this season, and a
three—on-three drill with crisp pass-
ing, spirited play, and only a few
missed shots.

They also got to see the scowl —
the stone-cold face of intensity that
Varga put on before the stretching
exercises finished. He lived up to the
look in one early drill, denying three
inbound passes in a row to the delight
of the coaching staff. With any luck,
the glare and the intensity will last for
the next five months or so.

“We’ll see what happens.”

Hopefully, what will happen is the
continued blossoming of Pitt’s young tal-
ent. After sitting out last season with back
problems, Kellii Taylor is healthy and
ready to challenge for the starting two-
guard position. He’s expected to be Pitt’s
top three—point threat and has outstanding
scoring potential: he averaged 23 ppg
during his senior year at Archbishop
Carroll High School in Washington, D.C.

“Kellii can find the basket and shoot
the ball,” Blount said. “He can do a lot of
other things too.”

Two new guys donning Panther uni-
forms for the first time are Isaac Hawkins
and Jarrett Lockhart.

“Lockhart and Hawkins are real

good,” Blount said. “But they’ll probably
have some times like we did last year.”

Originally recruited in 1994,
Hawkins is expected to give the Panthers
much needed help on the boards. At
Hargrave (Va.) Military Academy last
year, the 7—foot power forward averaged
18 points, 12 rebounds, and four blocks a
game.

Lockhart led the New York City
Catholic League with 25 points a game
last season. The 6-foot—2 guard also
pulled down nine rebounds a contest.

was intense, and the players appeared to
be loose and having fun.

“There’s a lot of enthusiasm,”
Cummings said. “Everyone’s looking
forward to this year.”

Everyone includes seniors Gerald
Jordan (8.7 ppg, 6.0 rpg), and Jason
Maile (6.2 ppg), who nailed nearly every
jumper he took yesterday. Pitt’s two
junior guards are Chris Gardella and
Kevin Willard (47 assists). Sophomore
forward Andre Howard looks ready to
break out of last year’s shell (3.7 points,
3.5 rebounds), and Amr El Nokali returns
to the team.

“The off-season was good for us,”
Cummings said. “We started lifting at 6
a.m. the Monday after we lost to Boston
College in the Big East Tournament.”

After the departure of players like
Allen Iverson, Ray Allen, and Kerry
Kittles, the Big East should be a wide-
open race. While many think Villanova
may be the elite team, the bulked—up
Blount had something to say. .

He said, “What about Pittsburgh,
man?”

shape — another good sign for an
opening practice. True freshmen
Jarrett Lockhart and Isaac Hawkins
kept up well in the drills, while red-
shirt freshman Kellii Taylor seemed
recovered from last season’s back
surgery.

Unfortunately, you’ll have to
take my word for it. Practices are
normally closed to the public, and
don’t expect to run into Varga or
Blount at a Trees Hall pickup game.
With Midnight Madness out of the
picture and the public’s first look at
this team a month away, fans don’t
know a thing about the squad that
will rule Pitt sports for most of the
winter.

That’s poor marketing. If stu-
dents ran the Bigelow campaign like
the school is previewing the hoops
season, that road would be a tum-
pike extension by now.

Kevin Lilley is (I columnist for The
Pitt News, and reminds you to write
the city council if you want to re-
open Midnight Madness.
