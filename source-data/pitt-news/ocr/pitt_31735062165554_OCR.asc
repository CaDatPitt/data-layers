UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

For Social Sciences, Humanities

Careers Conference
Slated For December

(See Editorial,

Page Four)

A Careers Conference for Liberal Arts students in the
Social Sciences and the Humanities will be held on Decem-
ber 6 and 7 in the SU Ballroom and Supper Room.

According to Dr. Walter

M. Ritenour, director of the

University Placement Service and chairman of the Student
Affairs Staff which is sponsoring the program, the conference

Voters Split
Mock Ballots

University students voted
for a split ticket in last Wed-
nesday’s mock election spon-

‘sored by the Program for

Political Education.
According to ﬁgures releas-

ed by Dr. Edward F. Cooke, as-
sociate professor of Political Sci-
ence and director of the Program
for Political Education, Joseph S.
Clark, Democratic incumbent for
the United States Senate, received
247 votes and William Scranton,
Republican candidate for gover-
nor, received 229 votes in the
lightest election vote in many
years.
Few Voted

However, only "380 students
voted. This ﬁgure is low compared
to the gubernatorial election of
1958 when 600 students voted and
the Presidental election of 1960

Like the election on Wednes-

day, the election of 1958 was
when 1400 students turned out to

also split, Lawrence and Scott
vote.

°will consist of “round-table dis-

cussion with representatives of
ﬁields which are seeking Liberal
Arts graduates.” ~

Dr. Ritenour added that “Sci-'

ence and Engineering students
have a great deal of contact with
ﬁrms in their prospective ﬁelds on
campus. We feel it’s about time
that the Arts students deserve this
kind of contact, as well.”

Never Before
.The Conference is also de-
signed to bring to the attention
of Arts students job opportuni-
ties in ﬁelds which have never
been presented for open examina-
tion before. Many of_the indus-
tries which will be represented in
the program, Dr. Ritenour feels,
have been considered ‘‘closed’’ to
the Arts graduate in the past, but
now have many openings.
Included in the participants
are agents from the ﬁelds of in-
dustrial relations, banking, ad-
vertising, journalism, retailing,
accounting, insurance and gov-
ernment agencies on. Federal,
state and county levels. Sev-
eral more carer areas are be-
ing considered for representa-
tion. ‘
Ritenour stresed that, although
certain ﬁrms will be selected to
meet with students, the Confer-

On Picketing
Red Label Draws
Student Comments
On Paper’s Politics
The lead editorial in last

Tuesday’s Pittsburgh Press
which identiﬁed‘ the weekend

pickets at the University
with the communist propa-
ganda machine has been

blasted by pickets and members
of the University’s student pub-
lications.

Entitled “This Is Free Speech?”
the editorial called attention to
the 12 “peace pickets" at the Uni-
versity “where you might expect
a better comprehension of world
affairs.”

The editorial writer‘ wonders
“why a student who saw Presi-
dent Kennedy’s quarantine as
‘American ‘aggression in Cuba’
didn’t gain a better understand-
ing of events from his studies. Or,
if he is so seriously deﬁcient in
logical analysis, how he ever got
into, the university in the first
place.”

Editorial Dismisses

The editorialcontinues by dis-

missing the students’ cries that

they were exercising free speech:.

Senate States Disapproval of
Student Riots on Cuba Policy

1 Disturbed Over University, City

Police Inaction at Picketing
1 By JOSEY GROSSMAN

Student Government unanimously stated their disap-
proval of the riot that resulted Friday when students picket-
ed against President Kennedy’s stand on Cuba. This Was a
direct violation. of the Constitutional freedom of assembly, it
stated, and it is the duty of SG to protect student freedom.

This stand, drawn up by Marty Landy, included three

statements. First, SG was ‘dis-O——*

turbed about and wants to deter-
mine the reasons for the lack of
University and city police action
in the riot. Secondly, “let it be
known that SG feels it the right
of all students to express their
beliefs and that it_is the duty of
civil authorities to protect this
right.”

Finally, the statement reads
that'SG was “embarrassed by the
action of certain students who in-
terfered” and felt that this was
not ﬁtting to a University student.

Reported Incidents

Schuyler Houser, representative
from Men’s Dormitory Council,

reported incidents of policemen’s .

lack of action. One student, “sign

torn and spat upon,” asked an
onlooking policeman, “Aren’t you
going to do anything?” “Any-

thing about what?” the policeman
replied.

_ In further business President
Tom Olofson reported that “SG
is impatient with the adminis-
trative committee on ID cards.”
Olofson. plans. to review this at
the Chancellor’s luncheon Tues-
day. “I’d -like -to see the whole
thing turned over to SG,” he
concluded. _ _

Pete Bijur reported that the SG
committee investigating ID cards
had gone to Penn State this week-
end and found “about the best
idea I’ve seen” in their system
of’ identiﬁcation. They use a
laminated ID card with the name
and student number on one side
and picture on the other. This
must be shown _with an activities
card, issued instead of invoices, to
get into an activity.

Olofson Explained

Olofson explained that the me-
chanics of the alcohol proposal
were complete. “Now it is up to
a number of students, faculty, and
administrative_ leaders to decide
the ﬁnal question.

“It is up to the discretion of
the administration as to whats
administrative body will decide
on the acceptance, rejection, or
modiﬁcation of the proposal."

P1‘0g1‘amS being on a trimester
calendar.

At the undergraduate level, the
campus will oﬁer courses in the

dies at the Master’s level in edu-
cation and business, and will con-

Referred to by his fellow Ar-

help strengthen constitutional
government in his native land,
Amadeo recently resigned his post‘
at the UN in protest against Pres-

imprisonment.

In the UN, Amadeo has served

‘ with great distinction as Chair- .

Bard Bans Blasting

“To be or not to “Bzzzzzzzzzzsst! Students with classes
in the ground floor of the Cathedral should be quite familiar

with this type of interruption.

Dr. Charles R. Crow, professor of English and humani-
ties, after suffering such interruptions during his 1 o’clock
class four successive times, decided to take ﬁrm action. He

_ reported his complaints to Dr. W!

George Crouch‘, chairman of the
English department, who then
reported the disturbance to the
dean ~‘ Humanities Department,
Dr. Wadsworth. Wadsworth sent
a letter to Richard C. Hodges, di-
rector of the Office of Student
Records, who made arrangements

“with the workmen to stop the

noise at 1:00 so that Dr. Crow’s
Shakespeare class could continue
undisturbed.

Crouch says “I realize that con-
struction around the Cathedral
must go on and must be completed
before winter. I think our depart-
ment is sympathetic with this, but
it is a matter of concern that
teachers can’t make themselves
heard. When the windows are
open instruction is nearly impos-
sible.’’

Crow reports that “it is simply
impossible to talk about anything
to a class when the noise of an

» air hammer is present. However,

we haven’t had the noise since the
arrangements were made. The
workmen have co-operated very
well.”

Sold, 500 Re-Ordered

The entire 500 copies of the
student directory were sold early

'last week. Tom Olofson, president

/of Student Government, said that
many students are still asking for
copies and that about 100 orders
are in from faculty members.

Olofson added that an addi-
tional batch ‘of 500 was expected
to arrive shortly.

High Schools

The School
Studies, the University’s eve-

of ' General

ning undergraduate school, is
planning to initiate an exper-
imental program in which
several college courses will
be taught by University faculty
at three area ' high schools.
This program, called the School
of General Studies Undergraduate
Extension Program, will begin in
January at Shaler Township High

School, Baldwin High School, and
Penn Hills High School.

-Each school will offer an
English course, “Expository Writ-
ing/,’ and one other course. An—'
thropology will be taught at Penn
Hills, mathematics, at Baldwin,
and psychology, at Shaler.‘All
classes will meet on Tuesdays
and Thursdays from 6:30 to 9:15

p.m., except for mathematics,
which will meet from 6:30 to
10:15 pm;

Extension students must follow
the same admission requirements
as students enrolledlin the School
of General Studies on the Oak-
land campus. They may enroll as

students, and applicants under 21
must submit their high school
credentials and may be required,
to take a qualifying examination.
Students who enroll in the ex-
teision program will pay $25 a
‘credit’ instead of~the usual $33 be-
cause of a system of,“grants in
aid.” This only applies, if they
live within the boundaries-of the
school district or beyond a ten
mile radius of the Oakland camp-
us. 4
Registration will be held in
each of the schools on a date to
be announced, as well as 2701 CL.
According to Dr. Viers Adams,
Dean of the School of ‘General
Studies, “We are making a speci-
ﬁc attempt to enlarge.the oppor-
tunities for people in this regio
to obtain an education.” -

Methodists Urge
Alcohol Ban Here

The Methodist Church has
urged citizens of Pittsburgh to
write to Dr. Alan‘C. Rankin ask-
ing that V the University keep
drinking off campus.

According to a Church spokes-
man, they are “vigorously op-
posed.” to the SG alcohol pro-
nized student organizations to
serve alcohol on campus.’

As assistant chancellor for stu-
dent and general affairs, Dr. Ran-
kin is now studying the proposal.

Spokesman for the church is the
Rev. John W. Gordon. He is now
serving as chairman" of the divi-
sion 'of temperance and general
welfare of the Western‘ Pennsyl-
vania Conference of the Metho-

dist Church.

Popularity Helps Alter

By BONNIE BUHL

Ideas and Figures, the University’s literary magazine,
has experienced arevolution in policy and style since Ed
Roberson become editor this fall. Now in the process of re-
leasing the seventh issue of I&F, he has revealed the names
of some new and promising contributors and their donations

.._....;.:-.,;_. 

 _I\\‘

L to the fresh and unusual /approach ofthis issue.

The magazine will be divided‘

into three speciﬁc, areas separating
ﬁction, art, and a photographic
essay. The photographic essay, to
be presented by‘ Photo Club mem-
bers Marge iNichols, Jim Osch—
man, and Joel Filnler, and poet
Gwen Visser, will consume the
center of the magazine in accord-

--=--r

ance with the serious tone of the
entire issue. Roberson considers it
the “highlight of the issue” and
is anxious to see the response to
its acceptance.

New fiction contributors to this
issue are Gretchen Dihoff, Laura
Wicinas, Annamae Pavlosky, and

Baymar Gorr, whose _‘.‘Pile of _.
,é:Rocks” is described as being noted

for its “rich, .clear descriptive
passages.” Go'rr’s story is center-
ed around the embarrassment of a
strange, old man at wanting _~ to
capture a little beauty for him-
self by collecting a pile of rocks.

Imagery Example 
"‘Su'mmer,” a long prose—poem
in short story form, by Gretchen
. Dihoff is another example‘ of
‘high imagery” in unusual fiction.

Rachael Poole and Richard
Tanski, two former contribu-
tors, will be presented with Sam
Freeman, Gwen Visser, and_

‘Ann Fertik in. the poetry sec-
tion ofthe fall issue of I & F.
Miss Fertik, the newest ‘poetic
voice -on campus, is the author-
es of “Andy” and “Poem,” a

A’ presentation of depression from
the woman’s point of view. Her
conversational and interrupted
style is thought to‘be influenced
by that of E. _E. Cummings.

I & F‘-"has established a new
sales program with the personal
contact policy, which has resulted
in boosting public relations and

zation has recruited new staff

workshop meeting was held on
October 2 and proved to be a suc-
cessful endeavor.

I & F has also set up a series
of scheduled reviews held in the

Fine Books Room at the Center
at which Dr-. Culver has pre-
sented the lasttwo.

M A new permanent publication
schedule has been set up with the
student reader in, mind. The
magazine will be compiled dur-
ing one trimester and will be re-
leased at ‘the beginning of the fol-

lowing trimester. This will pre-
sent the students with the oppor-

tunity to anticipate’ I&F at the
beginning of each term.

Advertising Avoided

So far '
avoided in I & F through such en-
dowments as The .Pittsburgh
Foundation Grant received last
year, University -subsidising, and

the magazine’s sponsoring of an

annual movie. The movie this
year will be “The Children’s
Hour,” and “Watch Your Stern”
at the Strand Theater from No-
vember’, 14,to 17.

S Roberson hopes to be able to
continue" avoidance of advertis-
ing as it affords him and his staff

the advantages of planning the.

layout as they please and keeping
the high level, of sophistication
that I&F has attained. ’

Almost as debatable as the question of whether base-
ball is a business or a game is the old one about college: is
 education for education’s sake, or is it merely a training
ground for careers in the working world?

In the same sense that a ballplayer accepts his pay-
check with a smile, even though he enjoys the competition

‘ I

I of the game, so do most students ﬁnd themselves concerned

about choosing a career almost as soon as they envision

I ‘ their diploma looming on the trimester—shortened horizon.

, For'- many students, such as those in engineering,
natural sciences, pre-Law or pre-Med,’ career problems are
usually limited to where they will work, rather than what
they will do for a living. The Liberal Arts student who

fmajors in the Humanities or Social Sciences, however, is

often at a loss when trying to determine “the right spot”
after graduation.
The Career Conference for such Arts Students, which

.will be held on December 6 and 7, is a much, needed step in

dealing with this problem. Headed, by Dr. Walter M. Rite-
nour, director of the University Placement Service, the
committee which is arranging the two-day program hopes
to assist the many undergraduates of this classiﬁcation by
presenting them with the opportunity to talk with profes-
sionals of various ﬁelds, _several of which have recently rec-
ognized the value of the student who has received the broad

' education.

, Dr. Ritenour has expressed his hope that the Confer-
ence will not take on the “carnival” atmosphere that simi-
lar programs for other groups of students have had in the
past. Rather, he hopes that Liberal Arts students will ap-
proach theround-table discussions with'open minds, sincere
interest and plenty of questions.

Participants in the program will be representing the
industry, ﬁeld or government agency with‘ which they are
associated, but not the particular company or organization
by which they are employed. This will allow a rare op-
portunity for students to learn about the many ﬁelds in

which careers are available without obligation.

Talking about careers with professionals inthe field" is
the best way in which to gain insights into the pros and
cons of how a speciﬁc type of job might suit one’s own taste.
Much can be gained if concerned undergraduates take ad-
vantage ofthe conference and draw as much as possible
from the spokesmen who will be collected on campus to

Classroom Cheating

back where it belongs,” he em-

   

Last week in one of my classes, a teacher told
the 150 students in the lecture section "that there
had been some trouble with their tests, tests which
he had already corrected, handed back, and dis-
cussed with the class.

“Reports have reached me of
extensive cheating during that
test,” he said. “I’m placing the
responsibilityfor cheating right

phasized. “It is the responsibil-
ity of the student body, perhaps.
through student organizations, to
police themselves.” , .

This teacher went on to ex-
plain -that students in the class
had complained to him that, in -
spite of his vigilance,‘ widespread cheating had
occurred during a true-false test. Since the scores
were being ranked within the class "on a normal
curve, cheaters did better than average, pushing the
average up, and makin_g all honest students suffer.

A student suggestion that two separate tests
should have been passed out to alternate seats,
since the class was too large for everyone to spread

 

out, was dismissed. It is impossible, the teacher _

explained, for two tests to measure learning
equally. Therefore, he felt that he could not, in
fairness to the students, resort to this measure.

Police State Policy

“I could have brought in ﬁve monitors to watch
everybody during the test,”-he said, “but this is not
going to be run like a police state.”

_ As he spoke, it occurred to me that he was cer-
tainly being fairer with the class than some‘ of the
students were being ‘to their contemporaries.

He told the class something that most of its
members have heard from other responsible teach-
ers and administrators: cheating in college is wide-
spread more now than ever before.

This teacher suggested that cheating is wide-
spread because it is condoned by- college students.
They view, cheating on tests as socially acceptable.

 

Gone With The Monsoon . ..

Movie Maharaias

By Barry Gross

If this is so, then responsibility for dealing with
cheating does lieiwith the students themselves. If
we don’t wipe out wide—spread cheating, we may
ﬁnd ourselves under tighter restrictions as the ad-
ministration attempts to‘deal with the problem.

It is not enough to argue that cheating has

always been a problem and always will be, or to.

shrug and say that we inexorably mold our morals
after those" of the past "generation, who therefore
are to blame. 1

No matter what the origin of this problem is,
it has its main effect upon‘ the students, and the
participants are students. Cheating does impair
the validity of that so-far necessary evil, grading.

I _Effe'c'l-ive Camlpaignﬂbebaiable

Whether or not Student Government or any

other student organization can campaign ef’fectively.)_,,—.x

against cheating, or if various social organizations
can exert moral pr_es'su're by condemning cheating
are questions open for debate.

Cheating on‘ tests is now more or less socially
acceptable on thisucampus (as long as you don’t get
caught). The only way to wipe it out is for stu-
dents to consider it" socially unacceptable, morally
wrong. . A

Which brings us to the problem of.sti-etched
loyalties. From childhood on, we have been bom-

barded by two rules ofpbehavior which sometimes. -

appear -contradictory. We have learned that it is
wrong to stand by and let evilztake place, but we
have also learned that being a tattletale is wrong.
A sense of loyalty, ‘a fear of being ostracized
for informing on a contemporary, have‘ stopped
many a st_udent, whether third grader or college
junior,'from reportinglinstances of cheating.
Unless ‘students, whether through organizations,
or as individuals,‘ can exert enoughmoral pressure
upon their contemporaries to drastically reduce the
amount of cheating on tests, then every student

of cheating he sees. If persuasion fails tohalt

By Viiay Jain

Mainly’ due to poor qualitydin the American
television, and partly, because the fascination of
the magic box is wearing out, the Hollywood movie
industry is on the upsurge.

During their lean years Hollywood has lost the
lead of ﬁlm production toiltaly, '
India and Japan. The technique
of ﬁlm production in foreign
countries, though basically the
same, does have diﬁ:'erences.. I

The star system which‘ has
drawn a lot of comment recently
after the trouble and cost of
“Cleopatra” and “Mutiny on the
Bounty" still exists in India. The
disease is even worse there; a"
few highly paid actors work in H
as many as a dozen pictures at »
once. and allot a day or two, between their relaxa-
tion, to the various independent producers.

Ten or Fifteen Years

Consequently, the average movie takestwo to
three years to make and a few have taken as long
as ten to ﬁfteen years. The artist is well paid for
his efforts; in most cases the male and female lead
account for one-third to one-half of the motion
picture's cost. Naturally not all the money is paid
as remunerations as that would put the performer
in the top income bracket, ways and means have to

be devised to pay the “black” money and then .bal- D

ance the books — a headache for the bookkeeper.

The silver screen has the glamour and fascina-
tion for the teenagers, but the industry, till re-
cently, was looked upon with disdain and no one
from a respectable family would associate with the
industry due to the scandals connected with it. The
situation has now been remedied through the ef-
forts and crusade of a leading newspaper chain,
which initiated some action by the government and
also brought change within the industry.

The newspaper publishing house also started its
own ﬁlm magazine to combat the scandal sheets
and yellow journals about the industry. They

produced in India. As a result, Indian ﬁlms have"

won numerous awards at the various Interriational
festivals and are gaining recognitionabroad.

The government’s awarenessof the ﬁlm industry
has risen to the point where six orvmore ‘_‘good”
movies get exemption from the tax "(which in some

states is as high-as 50 percent) and the money "re-,
mitted is refunded. ’ This policy is followed -by sev-. ‘’

eral states to encourage the production of worth-
while movies.

“Panther Pancha1i,” “Aparajito” and “son - of
Apu” are but a few of the Indian movies shown
commercially in the" States. I_t is only for the past
ﬁve years or so that the American Academy of Arts
and Sciences have asked India to submit entries
in the foreign ﬁlms category of the “Oscar” awards.
An Indian actor has been nominated twice for

“Oscars” ‘for the best supporting role of the yeal-_.-v

The star system is not all that the ﬁlm industry
has to contend with, the government has put re-
strictions on the import of the raw ﬁlm and other
items that are imported for the industry. The Cen-
sor Board has carried over from the British rule
and now guards the “morals” of the young and
old alike.

S Editorial Comments

Called Unfounded

Editor, The Pitt News

Congratulations, Mr. Editor,

you’ve managed to make some‘

earth-shaking, unfounded, and
unsupported statements 0 n c e
again. "

rm-st, I’d like to look at your
editorial from October 31, 1962,
concerning . . . ‘éthe person who
will pace the sidewalk at a
moment’s notice. Give him_ a
sheet of cardboard and a box of
crayons, and he will
anything for the sake, of making
a noise.”

Now, let’s take it from there.

,Where is your evidence concern-
:-'r.r -

ing this statement? What pro-
testor was ignorant of the is-
sues‘? Was it the people who
were anti-blockade, the support-
ers of Mr. Kennedy’s action, or
those picketing for freedom of
expression? Who demonstrated
just to get publicity? Again,
where is your evidence? If you
have none to support your ir-
rational contentions, why‘make
the statement?

Is the answer to the last ques-
tiin perhaps the fact that some
writers, given ‘a typewriter and
a column, will write anything
to fill space and “make a noise?”

Senior Irritated,

‘ By ‘Student Action
Editor, The Pitt News ‘

Many times in the past I have
found myself irritated about the
actions of students of the Uni-
versity. Indeed I_ have felt so
strongly at times that I felt like
writing to The, Pitt Nwes’ con-
-cerning pseudo-intellectuals who
, glibly cut up a professor’s7at-
tempt at idealism, or the Edi-
torial Staff’s petty attacks on the
fraternity system. All other
times, however, by the 'time'I
reached my typewriter I was
no longer provoked.- Today I
._ ﬁnd myself in a, different posi-
tion. '

I was unfortunate enough to
witness what I consider the
worst example of cowardly ac-
_tion and stupidity that I have
' students at
Pitt carry placards advertising
no more war, or the banning of
bombs, one can -only agree with
the ideal they are supporting.
Their efforts, however, should be
channeled in arousing students
in Moscowto the same cause:
There is no satisfaction to be
gained by exciting other, equally

asinine students to riot in pro- '

, test. If both groups would calm
logically‘ face the

haps justify their intellects.

The intelligent question to ask
is not when the U.S. will lift
its naval blockade so that the
world can reutrn to its “peace-
ful” state, but why did a Pres-
ident of the United States wait
so long before defending his
c o u n t ry against Communism?

"Kr,-\¥ This action had to be taken. Cer-

'tainly the values of liberty are
worth the danger,«or even death,‘
that may ensue.

The U.S. should not hesitate to
use force to protect its way of
life. It is unfortunate that the
threat of force was not used un-
til the international situation
had so deteriorated. Now the fu-
the human race is

gambled; will my children be
_ forced to live in a Communist
"*" society pr shall _I chance their
never being born to_make the
world safe for them? I am no

protest .

 ’

K

force to protect one’~s way of life
is clearly illustrated by the ex-
ample of the State of Israel.
One need not agree with their
cause to appreciate the fact that
they have maintained their way
of life by not hesitating to resort
to the same manner of defense

as their opponents offense.

Surely the time is over for
the U.S. to wave a ﬁnger at the

naughty, naughty Russians. Ap-'
‘peasement is only a temporary

breather which makes thermo-
nuclear war even more inevi-
table. One can only hope that
the retreating techniques of the
West have not carried us so far
back that forward progress is
impossible and war inevitable.
We can wait no longer to take
a stand. A

Certainly the tension would

ease if the world laid down its '

nuclear armaments, but my
placard—carrying fellow students
must understand that this can-
not be a one—sided gesture. As-
surances must be given before
JFK can lift the blockade that
missile shipments will stop, and

launching bases be dismantled.’

Then perhaps the world can
begin on its road back to sanity.
Until then, however, there is
nothing to gain by crying “ban
the bomb” or “let’s have no
more war” (so we can live out
our lives'in gentile cowardness).

The University of Pittsburgh_

should rather project an. image
of the intellect protection of
freedom (that same freedom
which allowed the sign carrying
in the first place), rather than
the crying reaction to fear. If
we must riot, and I’m led to be-
lieve that every red-blooded
American college must, let’s sup-
port our government and not
undermine our image.

United States Action

Labeled ' Aggressive '-
Editor, Tile" Pitt News
In all ‘the furious discussion of

the right of Americans to free
speech and police protection

.which has followed last Friday’s
disgraceful incident on_ campus, -

I fear that the real issue of the

‘past week has been lost sight of. V

The answer to the question of
whether American citizens ex-
pressing a minority opinion are
entitled to the rights guaranteed
them under the Bill of Rights is,
I hope, obvious.

What is not obvious is wheth-
er the American people are go-
ing to continue to tolerate the
hostile, aggressive policy which
their government has pursued
for almost four years with re-
gard to the revolutionary gov-
ernment of Cuba. This policy has
involved diplomatic and eco-
nomic pressures of a most ex-
traordinary nature on Cuba, and,
in April, 1961, it_ even involved

our government’s giving support .

to an armed invasion of the is-
land.

Last week, this policy, which
has been pursued with equal
vigor by both a" Republicanpand
a Democratic administration, ﬁ-
nally brought us to the point of
committing an illegal, unilateral
act of war which took the world
closer to the brink of nuclear
disaster than it had been in over
a decade.

This action was justiﬁed by
President K e n n e d y . on the

-grotfnds that there were “offen-

sive” missle bases in Cuba. How-
ever, once one has accepted the
principal of deterrent power (as
our government has done ever
since the end of World War II),
one may ask exactly what makes
Cuban missle bases any more
“offensive” than the bases with
which the United States has
very effectively encircled the
Soviet Union. Certainly, in view
of our past policy toward his
regime, Fidel Castro has every
reason to feel a;very acute need
for an adequate deterrent to
American aggression. a

Peace will be assured in the
Carribbean only when the Unit-
ed States assures Cuba that‘ it
has no aggressive intentions to-
ward her government, and when
some form of normal relations-
with that government is re-es-
tablished. V »

ciple. It’s a matter of propaganda
— communist propaganda . . ‘.
The “peace” pickets at Pitt were
part and parcel of the same prop-

aganda machine _which picketed
‘ the White House and the U.S.

embassy at Moscow.”

Arts sophomore Steve Ryack,
who was unofficial leader of
last Friday’s Ad Hoc Committee
to Prevent War Over Cuba,
said that the editorial contains
“allegations which could never
be substantiated.”

He considers it “a natural in-
clination of the conformist _press
— brainless parrots of the present
administration — to equal all dis-
sent with anti-Americanism.”

_ Reaction Asked
When asked if the reaction to
the demonstration had been ex-
pected,'R'yack replied that “peace
marchers, paciﬁsts, and socialists

. of all kinds are. aware that this

anti-intellectualism occurs.l’
“The article showed a lack

of judgment,” commented Mike
Kalisher, an arts freshman who
had joined the 5 p.m. demon-_
stration last Friday, protesting
the treatment given the noon
pickets.

“It is so vague and unjustifi-
able,” he said. “Being branded as
a Red makes me feel that they
speak ‘to make a noise, to sell
papers. I have _no respect for
them.” _

Received Criticism V

The editorial also received ad-
verse criticism from Jeff Hirsch,
a L.A. senior, who disagreed with
the attitudes held by Friday’s
pickets, and took .part in Mon-
day’s demonstration. He said he
is pro-Kennedy and pro-peace.

Hirsch called the editorial

“the most ridiculous political
editorial I’ve ever laid eyes on.
M05‘ Of FI'iday’s demonstrators
are as far from communism as
"the editors of the Press. The
Press is making a professional

selling point of its anti—com-
munism.” »

Irving N. Rothman, head of stu-.

dent publications at the Univer-—

sity, and Matthew Nesvisky, edi-
tor—in-chief of The Pitt News
commented upon the Press edi-
torial. Rothman ‘described its as-
sertions as being “near to libel.”
Nesvisky said that the conclusions
of the editorial are “incorrect and
unfounded.”

Crowds waiting to hear
Thursday night’s P.M. series
were overﬂowing the SU
Supper Room at 8:15. By 8:30
the entire SU.'Ballroom was

also jammed.

After some major obstacles
were overcome, the crowd heard
a skillfully executed program.
Alfred Deller presented folk
songs from the 16th and 17th
centuries. He was accompanied
on the lute by Desmond Dupre,
a talented artist in his own right.
The Antiqua Players also pre-
sented a few selections out of the
past. '

Deller in his soft,.ge‘ntle count-
er-tenori voice ‘sang five songs of
John Dowland (1562?1626) .fol-

qua Players droned through what
was called four pieces by Hein-
rich Isaac, (1450-1517) and what
sounded like .a fifteen minute
warmup session.
The ﬁrst half of the program
was completed by “Lullaby for
Holy Innocents’. Day” by William
Byrd (1543-1623), performed by
a. combination of all the artists.
, Unfortunately, this part of
the program was an almost
complete dud because of faulty
planning.‘ Three-fourths or the
capacity crowd was seated be-
hind a large square post which
completely obliterated the view.
Also there was great moving
about in the rear and many
people left. A part of the pro-
gram even had a. background

This provided a much better
vantage point for everyone_ and
those who remained in spite of
past chaos were rewarded by an
excellent performance.

A refrain of “Christ’s Passion”
written especially for Deller was
followed by “Adagiati Poppeo,”
‘‘Claudio Monteverdi” and Salve
Regina” (1567-1643) . performed
by the combination of singers and
players. The Antiqua Players
were on their own again to do
“Trio Sonata in C Major” (1681-
1767). We were sure that they
were actually playing this time
because we could see them but
they sounded much the same.

Deller, Dupre and the harpsi-
chord were combined for the ﬁnal
selection, Three songs of Henry
Purcell (1659-1695). These were
superbly done and merited loud
ovation and several encores.

ii//“ “It Goes On ..."

HOMECOMING

The insufferable gloom of the Commons Room could not
dampen the winning spirits of the milling dancers of Home-
coming. _,

It was time to toast the queen. The Pitt Chest — Tackle
Gary Kaltenbach — loomed under the wrought iron gate of
the archway. His appearance had the same effect as Moses
had when he stood on the banks of the Red Sea.

A fissure ran through the crowd -— it was an exag-
gerrated version of the holes that Kaltenbach and l’llS
fellow lineman had been opening all day in the Syracuse.
line. “The aisle must be wider,” the toastmaster demand- “
ed.

“Just how big is Kaltenbach?” someone asked.

“Pretty big after that victory today, I’d say,” another
answered.

Down the aisle came Kaltenbach with a wrist—lock on
the sweetest thing he had tackled all day — Beverly Hodg-
kinson, the bright, full-cheeked Homecoming Queen.
Fraternal Treaty‘ .

It was the crowning event of the day. The men of Delta
Tau Delta and Sigma Chi ‘were among «the happy-faced
crowd, both smiling fraternally at one another, forgetting
their brawl in the Stadium that afternoon.

They had knocked the stuiizings out of a papier
mache “sweetheart of Sigma Chi” that afternoon to in-
cite their Greek-styled riot. That’s probably the real rea-
son Miss Hodgkinson was attended by Mr. Kaltenbach.
You see, she’s the real “sweetheart ‘of Sigma Chi,” and
no papier mache doll.

“Did the students cheer today?” a’ young miss asked her
beau in a whisper. the kind they utilize in the bad breath
commercials on TV.

“Only when they scored a touchdown,” replied the fel-
low, pointing out the sophistication of Pittsburgh collegians.
He was a bit wrong, however, as the students responded with
slight tremors to ﬁrst downs and the barbaric tackling of the
Panthers which held the Orangemen to a net rushing total of
minus 11 yards.

They did this with the knock-down effectiveness of Raid,
the insecticide used by nine out of every ten Phi Gamma
Delta men. Among the dancers were some husky marauders
who had enveloped Syracuse backs like fly-paper.

Tight Collar _ - '

Gene Sobolewski looked narrow and lean in his dark
suit, just as scythe-like as he had been that afternoon when
he collared Orange quarterback Walley Mahle four times
in his backﬁeld for loses of five, nine, one and ten yards,
respectively.

The Sammy’s were singing “you’ll wonder where the
~Orangemen' went,” when Sobolewski pulled down the Syra-
' cuse back.

There were others in the crowd who had stood out
that day: Ralph Conrad, the man who enabled Pitt to
get that ﬁrst quick score when Ernie Borghetti recovered
that fumble in the end zone. Conrad was the man who
had blasted a retreating Bill Schoonover, causing him to
fumble.

There was sophomore._standout, Bernie LaQuinta, who
recovered two fumbles and was involved in twelve tackles,
shooting from his middle guard spot. And Borghetti’s fumble
recovery wasn’t his only feat. He made ﬁve tackles alone in
the ﬁrst quarter of the game.

Crashing Ends ? ? .7 ,

Joe Kuzneski made tackles that had Syracuse losing ten
and seven yards. He and Sobolewski had given the Panthers
the best end rush since Mike Ditka and Ron Delﬁne gradu-
ated.

John Draksler, Marty Schottenheimer, John Maczuzak,
Bob Sorochak, Jack Price, Tom Brown, and Ed Adamchik
had pulled through, too. It was Adamchik who mowed down
three Syracusans in a Domino-like effort when Paul Martha
raced 31 yards for the second score.

Aside from Martha the rest of the backs were steady
but not spectacular. Of the lot perhaps Bill Bodle showed
that he’s going to be a contender for the halfback role.

As for Martha, he merely winked, and smiled. “That’s a
little better,” he said, reflecting on his two-touchdown day
and recalling his ﬂop day at Navy a week before.

“Our line was great today,” Martha said. “Syracuse may
be the strongest team physically that We’ve played. Yet
there were big holes in that line and I’d say it was the best
they’ve played all year.

“Still a lot of guys weren’t satisﬁed with their per-
formances today,” Martha concluded. They can save
their vengeance for Notre Dame next Saturday.

Orangemen’s
Attack Stalled
By Crashers

By BOB SMIZIK

Syracuse ran into what
Coach John Michelosen call-
ed “our best defensive game
of the year,” and crawled out
of Pitt Stadium a 24-6 loser to the
Panthers, Saturday.

The Panther defense, which
only last week allowed Navy to
go over, around and through it
with remarkable ease, not only
held the Orangemen to minus 11
yards rushing for the afternoon
but was either directly or in-
directly responsible for the team’s
three touchdowns.

The ﬁrst Panther score came
when Syracuse, after looking
amazingly inept on its ﬁrst three
plays from scrimmage, went into
punt formation. The Syracuse
center Len Slaby came closer to
splitting the "uprights with the ball
than he did in getting the ball into
punter Bill Schoonover’s hands.

Generous Mood

Schoonover managed to pick
the _ball up on his own ﬁve, but
like Slaby he too was in a gen-
erous mood, and fumbled. Ernie
Borghetti pounced on the ball in
the end zone for a touchdown.

A jubilant Borghetti explain-
ed the play this way. “Ralph
Conrad hit him and he fumbled
the ball. We had about four
guys going after the ball, and
Ralph got it ﬁrst on the one-
yard line, but it popped out of
his hands and I got it in the end
zone.” It was the ﬁrst touch-
down Borghetti ever scored in
his football career.

Later in the same period a Pete
Billey punt put Syracuse ‘on its
own seven. Once again Syracuse
could do nothing and a weak punt
gave Pitt the ball on the Orange
26.

Three plays lost ﬁve yards but
on fourth down Paul Martha, be-
hind a wave of beautiful blocking
led by Ed Adamchik and Bill
Howley, went 31 yards for a score
on a double reverse.

T Martha Scores

The defensive unit came
through again in the fourth period
as Martha picked off a Syracuse
pass and went 54 yards for his
second touchdown.

The offense made’ its best
showing of the day in the sec-
ond quarter as the Panthers
marched 61 yards to set up
Rick Leeson’s 35-yard ﬁeld
goal.

 

Downs Syracuse, 24:-6-.

wonders where hislblocking went as Panthers Jack Price (77) and
Gene Sobolewski (81) nailhim for a sizeable loss. It was charges
like this that limited the losers to a net rushing yardage of

minus 11’ yards.

West Chester Erases

Big Deficit in Stalemate

Michelosen pointed’to end Gene
Sobolewski as defensive star for
his team. “Sobie seemed to be the
standout," he said. “His rushing
helped our pass defense quite a
bit." ‘ ‘

. Throw-back

Sobolewski harassed Syracuse
quarterback Wally Mahle all day
and at times looked like a throw-
back to the Panther ends of a few
years ago like John Paluck, Joe
Walton and Mike Ditka who spent
most of their afternoons in the
opposition’s backﬁeld.

Michelosen dipped into the
ranks of his hard—nosed sopho- .
more corps, which has already
produced defensive stalwarts
like M a r t y Schottenheimer,
Jack Price and Bob Sorochak,
for the games other defensive
star, Bernie LaQuinta.

An ex"-fullback, LaQuinta made
his debut as a‘ left guard and mid-
dle lineback and auspicious one
by tackling hard and frequently.

° Liberati Scores

Twice, Cuthbert A
Tallies Last Goal

By FRED MARCUS

A headstrong West Chester
team got off the ground Satur-
day and caught up with a riled-
up Panther soccer team that had
a three-goal headstart, ﬁnishing
in a 3-3 deadheat on the foot-
ball practice ﬁeld before a crowd
of. about 500.

The tie adj_usts the Panther’s
record to 6-0-2, which still quali-
ﬁes the club for a_n NCAA berth.
They blasted off to 'a‘ 3-0 lead
early in the game. Awarded two
penalty shots, co-captain Paul
Liberati whistled in both along
the ground to the goalie’s left. A
little later, Corky Cuthbert came
blazing in from the left, riﬂed
a shot on goal that was blocked,
and he drove in the rebound.

No Quitters

The West Chester Rams,
though, are a well-balanced team,
a ball-control team, and a team
that never quit. They fought back.
In the process, All-American cen-
ter forward Don Williams re-

' ceived_ credit for a “hat trick.”

The rangy Williams (six feet,
three inches tall) who towered’
above all the other players,
used his head in more ways than
one.

Seeing Tom Staab come to the
near corner of the goal, he hooked
a long, wobbly shot into the far
corner. Later, he received a pen-
alty shot. Coming up to meet the
ball slowly so as to make Staab.
commit himself ﬁrst, Williams
then socked the ball into the goal
so hard that it -wouldn’t have
mattered which way Staab dived.

For his ﬁnale, the center for-
ward headed in a shot during
a scramble in front of the goal.
The Panthers outhustled the
Rams in the ﬁrst quarter. Then,
when they piled up their lead,
and because, according to coach
Leo Bemis, the starters were
bruised a little due to the “soft-
ness tests” administered by West
Chester, they played back a little.
After the Rams tied the score
though, they began to beat West

Chesterto the ball again.

Stops Enemy Scorers

By ART FLEISHNER

The role of'a defenseman =1

in any sport is not very glam-
orous. It remains for the of-

fensive man, the big, to grab .}

all the headlines.

In soccer it is the wings, _'

center, and inside men who see
their names in print. It is the
same way here where the efficient

job done by fullback Andy Mc—_.
Graw goes unnoticed by everyone "

except the coach, his teammates
and a few astute observers of
the game.

McGraw is a rugged 190-pound
sophomore from Morgan, Pa., a
town where football -is only two
short steps ‘ahead of soccer in
popularity. He is 25'-years.-old, the
father of three children. In order
to be able to go to school, he
must also work for the railroac
on a switchtower.

,Stalls Scorers

Beside the goalie,,Andy has the

 

 

\

most important defensive position _.

on the squad..He plays in fron?
of the goalie. His main job is to
defend against the leading scor-
er of the opposing team.

This year he did’ not permit
Peter Milicli, leading‘ scorer of
soccer-power Akron to score
one goal. Lastvseason Milich
had 30 goals. This season he
didn’t- even get offone shot at
Panther goalie Tom Staab.

, Andy did not play for ‘Pitt as 2
freshman. _In fact, batore last
April during spring practice, he
had only played once or twice
since 1956. .

Coach Bemis’-smiles when he
recalls how he got Andy on the
team. “Last April during spring
practice,” Bemis said, “he came

to me and asked if he could try .

out for the team. And now look
where he is.” " ~." A
Andy lVIcGraw is a fellow who

-has had to work for everything

he has obtaine‘d.V.He had to be
tutored and had to take extra
credits to gain admission to col-
lege. He gave up a good insur-

‘ance job and took a chance at

college after not going to school
for ﬁve years. ,
No_w he is in Business Admin-
istration with about a 2.8 aver-
age. Andy is not~one_,of the cap-
tains of the squad although he is

” the oldest, yet Bemis says, “There

is no doubt that -he is a team

leader.

GLOOM AT THE TOP

Oh, sure, you’ve been busy, what with going to classes, doing
your homework, catching night crawlers, getting married—-
but can’t you pause for just a moment and give thought to that
dear, dedicated, lonely man in the big white house on the hill?
I refer, of course, to the Proxy. ‘

(It is interesting to note here that college presidents are al-
ways called “Prexy.” Similarly, trustees are called “Trixie.”
Associate professors are called “Axy—Pixy.” Bursars are called
.“I’oxy-Woxy.” Students are called “Algae.”)

But I digress. We were speaking of the Prexy, a personage at

once august and pathetic. Why pathetic? I-Vell sir, consider how‘

Prexy spends his days. He is busy, busy, "busy. He talks to
deans, he talks to professors, he talks to trusteees, he talks to
alumni. In fact, he talks to everybody except the one group
who could lift his heart and rally his spirits. I mean, of course,
the appealingest, endearingest, winsomest group in the entire
oollege—you, the students. '

. It'is the Prexy’s sad fate to be forever a stranger to your’ '

laughing, golden selves. He can only‘ gaze wistfully out the
window of his big white house on the hill and watch you at your
games and sports and yearn with alfhis tormented heart to bask
in your warmth. But how? It would hardly be ﬁtting for Proxy
to appear one day at the Union, clad in an old rowing blazer,
and cry gaily, “Heigh-ho, chaps! Who’s for sculling‘?”'

 

No, friends, Prexy can’t get to you. It is up to you to get to
him. Call on him at home. Just drop in unannounced. He will
naturally ‘be a little shy at ﬁrst, so you-must put him at his

ease. Shout, “Howdy-doody, sir! I have come to bring alittle

sunshine into your drear and blighted life!” Then yank his
necktie out of his vest and scamper goatlike around him until

' he is laughing merrily along with you.

Then hand him a package and say, “A little gift for you, sir.".

“For me?” he will say, lowering his lids. “You sl1ouldn’t
have.”

“Yes, I should,” you will say, “because this package is
a carton of Marlboro Cigarettes, and whenever I think of
Illlarlboro, I think of you.” C‘

“Why, hey?” he will say curiously. -

“Because Marlboros haveitaste, and so do you," you will
reply. , ‘
‘‘Aw, go on,” he will say, blushing furiously.

“It’s true,” you.will say. “Moreover, Marlboro ll.'l~‘ :4 filter,
and so do you.” '

“In my swimming pool, you mean,” he will say.

“Yes,” you will say. “Moreover, Marlboro has a soft pack,
and so do you.” ’

“My limp leather brief case, you mean,” he will say.

“Yes,” you will say. “Moreover, the Marlboro box has 3

‘ﬂip-top, and so do you.” .

“But I don’t have a ﬂip-top,". he will say.
“But you will,” you will say. “Just,ligh,t a Marlboro, and
taste that tasty taste, and you will surely ﬂip your top.”
Well sir, you will have many a good chuckle about that, you
may be sure. Then you will say, “Goodbye, sir, I will return
soon again to brighten your lom and desperate life.” ‘
“Please do,” he will say. “But next time, if you can possibly
manage it, try not to come at four in the morning.”
