Romance Languages  
To Split into Hispanic
Italian,FrenchDivisions

By PETER. KIIMFNY
The present Department of the Romance Languages
will be reorganized into the Hispanic division and the French
and. Italian division in the fall of 1966. This will be in se-
quence with the expansion, begun in 1962, of the foreign"

language areas’.

Dr. Rudolfo Cardona, acting chairman of the Depart-
ment of Romance Languages, has been named chairman of
the Department of Hispanic Languages and Literature."

Arts Library
To be Open
For Grads

’ The Henry Clay Frick Fine
Arts Library will be open during
the summer only to graduate stu-
dents and faculty in the art de-
partment Monday‘ through Fri-
day from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ,

The library will be open to
undergraduate students after its
University dedication in Septem-
ber. Undergraduates taking art
courses at present may obtain
admission to the library through
special arrangements with the
art departinent.

“The entire ﬁne arts library,

_ _ forr_n_e,rly _ _on‘_ the seventh , ﬂoor of

the Cathedral ‘has been moved
into the new Fine Arts Building.

.Books placed on’ reserve for art

courses, however, .wﬂl remain

. in the reserve book room on the

sixth -ﬂoor of the Cathedral. '

The Fine Arts Building will be
open to the public until July 4,
Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
and Sundays from 2 to 5 p.m.
After July 4, the library will be
closed on weekends.

Dr. Cardona stated that the
change in status is being made to
increase administrative efficien-

cy. He added-that the growth in‘

the Romance language area and
the added interest in Hispanic
studies in particular make the re-
organization necessary.

University projects such as
the one in Quito, Ecuador, tend
to spot-light the growing recog-
nition given to Spanish studies
at the University, Dr. Cardona
pointed out.

Arthur Fedel, special assistant
to the vice-chancellor of the Aca-
demic Disciplines, commented
that this move is being done for

purely» academic reasons. No ﬁ-_

nancial considerations entered in-
to the decision, he said and add-
ed that the new division would
involve even higher expenditures
because of the added .adminis-
trative costs.

Dr. Philip Koch, associate pro-
fessor‘ of French and the future
chairman of the French and Ita-
lian department, conﬁrmed that
such a move has long been con-
templated.

All current graduate and un-
dergraduate programs will still
be offered after the reorganiza-
tion.

Sigma Chi Suspension

By FRED N. FRANK

The suspension by Sigma
Chi social fraternity’s na-
tional officers of its Stan-
ford! University chapter has
sparked national interest in
the problem of possible dis-

crimination in some national col-
lege fraternities and sororities.
The‘ 110 year old’ fraternity.
founded at Miami .
Oxford, Ohio, removed a race
clause from its constitution sev-
eral years ago, as did most other
national fraternities and soror-
ities. Last December, a group of
Stanford Sigma‘ -Chi alumni
charged that despite the removal,
local chapters were “not free to
pledge Negroes . . . the national

, constitution was amended to take

out the ‘white clause’ as such,

 Arouses Controversy

but the membership application _

procedures were changed so that
the national (fratemity) now has
the veto power over -every appli-
cation.”

At the end of January, Sigma
Chi’s national president, ‘Harry
V. ‘Wade, an Indianapolis insur-
ance company president advised
“the boys at Palo Alto” against
taking in a Negro and three
weeks later repeated his warn-
ing.  '

Early in April, however, the
Stanford chapter pledged Ken-
neth Washington, son of a Den-
yer Negro doctor. The -national
Sigma Chi officers suspended the
chapter a week later. There is
controversy over whether the
suspension actually came before
the pledging of Washington or
whether it came for other prob-
lems in the relations between the
national Sigma Chi administra-
tion and its Stanford chapter.

The Beta Theta chapter of
Sigma Chi is located at the Uni-

versity. Jock Beachler, former’

president of the University chap-
ter, said “there was certainly
nothing in the by-laws” which
could be considered in any way
a discriminatory clause.

The Stanford case threatens a
wide split among the 135 chap-
ters of Sigma Chi at the frater-
nity’s national convention, in
Denver this week, Beachler said
in this case, “I imagine we (his
chapter) would vote against the
national.”

Parker F. Enwright, associate
dean of men in charge of fra-
ternities, said “I have no com-
ment because I do ‘not know the
true facts of the case. In a sit-

‘ uation Whichis so charged with

emotion, I have found it unwise

A new law, such as the recent
bond referendum, which appro-
priated $11 million for commun-
ity colleges, is the only way the
county could appropriate money
to the University,_- according to

Dr. McClelland Qxplained that

the city and county,_gov‘érninents_,,_:t3;;

stitutions such as the Pittsburgh
Symphony, but such funds serve

to purchase services such as con- .

' “I’m against any emergency

appropriations for Pitt,” stated
Blair F. Gunther, Republican"
county commissioner, “because ‘if
we give aid to Pitt we’llhave to
give aid to Duke, Chathain, and

.the rest of them.
“If the city did give the Uni- S .

versity appropriations, '_ w-h er e‘
would .they get the money for

the community colleges,” said 1
Commissioner Gunther. Whenv 7

asked . to comment "on the fact
that the community colleges will

‘not be started until 1966, the‘ 
Commissioner said, “Let Pitt get .. “

their money. . . . If Pitt wants

money they can get it from the 

state.” '

“The city or county cannot
by law, make any contributions.
to private organizations,” stated
John McGrady,'Democratic coun-

ty commissioner. “It’s a second I - »
class county code, and I'm sure’ i

the city has a similar law.

“We legally can’t,’’ , continued »

Commissioner McGrady. “Once
you open up for one private or-

«

ganization every one is after you .

has been turned down -in the

Drafts Fred (Mazurek

By TOM SACKS

The only conclusion to be
drawn from major league
baseballs’ first draft last
week is that inexperienced
high school players ‘have a
better.chance of being draft-
ed than collegiate athletes.

Fred Mazurek and Doug Chamb-

ers, the University's top players,

prove this irony. Mazurek’s .484
batting average this season made
him the nation's‘ second leading
collegiate hitter. Yet, the Minne-
sota Twins did not draft him un-
til the fourth round. In the fourth
round, the clubs had an unlimit-
ed number of ‘selections.

Chambers caught nearly every

g.ame during this year’s 18-3 sea- ‘

son. His defensive performance
was continually praised by op-
posing coaches, including West
Virginia's Steve Harrick. Quick
reﬂexes and his .333 batting aver-
age made him a prize catch. He
was not drafted.

The baseball draft consisted of
four rounds. In the ﬁrst round,
each of the 20 clubs had one
choice. In the second‘ round, they

V had two picks and three choices

in the third round. The fourth
round was unlimited.

Drafting rights give the club a
six month period in which to
sign its priority. The draft was
designed -to curb the spiraling
bonuses of the past several years.

Nearly all of the selections in
the ﬁrst round were for high
school seniors. “I’m anxious» to

DOUG _ CHAMBERS
Baseball Draft Reject

see how this works" out. said
coach Bobby Lewis. “The major
league clubs ﬁgure that a boy
coming out of college is less like-
ly. to be starry-eyed about play-
ing ‘professional baseball than a
high school boy.

“Someone from high school
would be more willing to spend
four or ﬁve years in the minor

leagues in order to work his way '

his way -up. A college graduate
has a degree and a chance for a
good job. It's natural that he
would be more skeptical of a
contract with small pay and lit-
tle security.” he concluded.

  Moll Flanders

By ROBERT HOROWITZ

Moll Flanders is a recent example of the new Wave of

films that have come to the screen. The pattern was set by

, the successful, Academy Award winning movie Tom Jones.
_ These movies have four main points. in common. First,
they are ‘adapted to the screen from books written in and

of these movies, just as that of the books deals with the lower class
way of life: prostitution, thievery, and hard labor; and the upper-
class way of life: prostitution, thievery, and no labor. Fourth, and

direct way. V
Moll Flanders was adapted from Daniel Defoe’s book of the ‘same
name (Defoe is most famous for his Robinson Crusoe). The movie
deals with the misadventures of a young orphan girl (Kim 'Novak)
A who attempts to make her fortune by marrying a wealthy man. Her
_ spirits are notilowered by the accidental death. of her fool of ‘a‘ ﬁrst

T "husband. ’

. A After a brief masquerade in order to seduce what she thinks is
a. Wealthy sea captain, who turns out to be 3 highwayman (Richard
Johnson), she seeks out and marries an alderman, the banker of the
City of London. She separ.ates from the alderman because of her love
for the highwayman and turns to thievery to make her fortune.

_ . M011 and her _cohorts are arrested and sentenced to be hung. Her
husband (the alderman) saves the day by having a, fatal heart at-
tack when he sees his wife in jail during his inspection of the D1'iS0!l~

_  Since. she is his sole heir she receives all his money with which she

‘ . ‘buys freedomgfor herself and her accomplices. She marries her high-

ﬂlvvaymanwand sails to America where we assume the rest of her days
are happy ones. ' '

. I In some ways this movie fails to measure up to the standard set

' ; by Tom_ Jones and at other points it‘ is in the Tom Jones class. The

photography is colorful and bright, but does not compare to the

technical feats used in Tom Jones. However, the setting, especially
when Moll enters London for the ﬁrst time, does give the feeling of
18th century England. As in Tom Jones, the costumes show the con-
trast between the aristocrat’s gaudiness and the poor man’s dullness.»

 

. about the 18th century. Second, ‘they tell of a part of the
18th century about which many people do not know. Third, the plot ‘

perhaps most obvious, these movies and books deal with sex in a‘
