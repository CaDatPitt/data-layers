Demands Aired In Demonstration

' creased decision-making power.

ESTHER KITZES

by BRUCE LEVENSON
" Staff News Editor

Approximately 500 students and
faculty gathered in 121 CF Mon-
day at noon for a “free and open
discussion” on the demands pre-
sented to Chancellor Posvar last
Friday. Chancellor Posvar and six
members of the administration hi-
erachy made themselves available
for questioning.

The meeting was a rare oppor-
tunity for students, faculty, and
administration to air their
thoughts. For many of those in at-
tendance, it was the first time
time that they were able to see
and hear many of the administra-
tors. Each administrator that
spoke at the rostrum was met with
intermittent cries of “who’s he?"

Provost Charles Peake said that
he couldn’t see how a trustee af-
fects a student.

The overriding ‘issue that was
discussed concerned the concept
of governance. All of the students
and faculty who voiced opinions
were in agreement that the ad-
ministration held far too much Search for truth?" gwoboda ask-

body and faculty would h3Vo in‘ versity but ours.” He also said

“Is the University a corpora-
tion or an institution for the

a function of the administration.

Chancellor Posvar stated that
“most of our trustees happen to
be able men who give their time
voluntarily.” He quickly asserted
that there was nonetheless “a
great deal to criticize” about
some of the Trustees.

The Chancellor further assert-
ed that he was “very strongly op-
posed” to the bill proposed by
Trustee and State Senator Robert
‘Fleming. “I intend to work
against this and similar bills,"
Posvar promised. He said that he

Wolf Swoboda, history teach-
ing fellow, summed up this feel-
ing when he said, “The demands
are legitimate because we made
them, not because the adminis-
tration re-interpreted them.”

A great amount of dissent was
voiced against the Board of Trus-
tees. This was mostly a result of
a paper circulated around cam-
pus during the last few days that
lists profiles of some of the Trus-
tees. The circular describes the
large financial holdings of these
members of the board. -

History teaching fellow Josh_
Chasan voiced disagreement with
the nature of the Board of Trus-
tees. He called for equitable rep-
resentation of the Pittsburgh com-
munity of the Board. “Let us de-
fine the community." said Chas-
an. “then let us choose the repre-
sentatives. Maybe we don't want
businessmen to sit on the Board.
The Trustees should be living
home, living here. working for the
community.”

sible in opposition to the propos-
ed legislation. “This may or may
not involve publicity.” he contin-
ued, because “publicity is part‘
of the motivation of the sponsor
of this bill.”

Professor White called for “ac-
tive. open, militant leadership”
by the administration to oppose
the Fleming bill. “I regret that
Fleming does not seem to be un-
usual compared to the other Trus-
tees,” White surmised. Chasan

Publicity Director Joseph Col-
angelo pointed out that a union
leader and K. Leroy Irvis, a Black
man are also Trustees.

ly demand that Fleming resign
his trusteeship.

The Chancellor cited three vi-
tal interests of the University: the
student interest, the faculty inter-
est, and the public interest. The
public interest according to Dr.
Posvar, “is sometimes overlooked,
but cannot be denied.”

Chasan termed the recent deci-
sion to destroy mentor and resi-
dent assistant files “a victory.”

Jack Critchfield. assistant chan-
cellor of student affairs, said that
this decision was not reached as
a result of'the meeting last Fri-
day. “This occurred because of
meetings and investigations that
have been held for the last few
months."

SG President Scott Baum back-
ed up Dr. Critchfield. “This de-
cision was not a galvanic reac-
tion to the Friday demonstrationx;

Chancellor Posvar further stat-
ed that “coercion is irrelevant to
the performance of just acts. He
denied that Black attempts to co-
ercion were influential in the
compliance with Black Action So-
ciety demands.

Dr. Piosvar reiterated his feel-
ings on racial injustice at the. Uni.-
versity. He cited “a great deal of
misunderstanding” and mention-
ed that “progress on the BAS, de-
mands has been unsatisfactory.”

The question of the presence of
FBI informers on the campus was
posed to Dr. Critchfield. “I firm-
ly believe that if anyone isan in-
former, it is without the know-
ledge of the administration,” he

replied. “The University does not

approve of it.”

One student asked for a court
injunction to be filed against the
informer that was mentioned in a
recent Pitt News article. Another
student recommended that the in-
former be publicly exposed and
that his picture be printed in the
school newspaper.

The Provost spoke of “a whole-
sale review of curriculum.” He
mentioned that CAS Dean David
Halliday is in the process of ap-
pointing a committee to conduct
this review. Peake mentioned that
he favored an extention of/the
passfail program.

Lew Taffer, an editor of Alter-
natives, brought up the case of
Clarence Beers refusal to publish
issue number four of that maga-
zine because of his conscience.
He questioned Dr. Posvar, “Will
you then support ‘any faculty
member who’s conscience tells
him to not give letter grades?” '

“There is no absolute criteria,”
the Chancellor replied. “The po-

attendance when she said that

“students must come up with‘ a- «

dent demands are to be met. '

Many students suggested that
forums of the nature of this meet-
ing be held on a regular basis.

Gladstone M. Ntlabati. exiled
black South African leader. will
discuss “The Ethical Justification
for Violent Revolution in South
Africa“ tomorrow at noon in the
SU Ballroom.

Ntlabati was arrested in South
Africa in 1963 and charged with
violation of the “suppression of
Communism Act" for being a
member of the banned African
National Congress. An ordained

Methodist minister, he was later.

exiled for speaking out against
apartheid from his pulpit.

Since his banishment from his
homeland, Ntlabati has traveled
throughout the United States and
Canada, speaking about the plight
of the South African people op-
pressed under a fascist govern-
ment comparable to that of Hit-
ler‘s Nazi Germany.

Beside maintaining a busy
speaking schedule, Ntlabati has
worked with Southern Christian
Leadership Conference and Stu-
dent Non-Violent Coordinating
Committee. He asserts that,
through these experiences, he has

come to recognize the struggle of
the Black people of South Africa
and that of the Black people in
this country as one. Many of his
co-workers have described him as
having the dedication and charis-
ma of Dr. Martin Luther King.

Ntlabati also has been chosen
by the African National Congress
as its representative to North
America and he is currently work-
ing toward his Ph.D. at Harvard
University.

The lecture is sponsored by the
Pitcairn — Crabbe Foundation.

SC Approves BAS

The Steering Committee of the Urban Affairs Student As-
sociation. Graduate School of Public and International Affairs.
has announced its complete support of the Black Action Society

and their recent endeavors.

In a statement made last Thursday. the committee also en-
dorsed the seven-point pledge signed by Chancellor Wesley Posvar.

As graduate students in urban affairs, the committee feels
that the changes initiated by confrontations, such as the takeover
of the Computer Center, make the University more relevant to
the present conditions of modern cities.

The committee has placed full responsibility for these con-
frontations on those who made them necessary by blocking or
slowing progress toward improved racial relations.

Also included in that statement was a comment that. hope-
fully, the University's policies in admission, recruiting. scholar-
ships. and hiring can be instruments of social change.

cording to information sheets
from Monday's Career Seminar
in the SU Ballroom, is “to foster

man and his world.”

This phrase summarizes the
goal of the entire Seminar. Ac-
cording to Mrs. June Rubel, co-
ordinator of PESO. the Seminar
provides an informal setting in
which students may discuss their
vocational choice with members
of various professions.

Students may question the pro-
fessional representatives concern-

ing salaries, job opportunities and
the necessity of post-baccalaureate
study. Members of the profession
are able to provide answers from
personal experience which, al-
though necessarily subjective, are
real reactions to experience.

For the Social Work Seminar,
PESO recruited representatives
from agencies which involve re-
habilitation. civil rights, mental
health, family and children‘s
services, and community plan-
ning.

Editorial

The greatest roadblock to the solu-

‘tion of problems within a defined com-

munity is faulty communication. In

if every community the leaders fail to

communicate adequately with the citi-
zens. This was, and still is the greatest
problem that limits University prog-
ress.

The lack of communication and
lack of awareness was keenly evident
Monday at the Project Thought
“Teach-In.” Many charges were made
by students that reflected our serious

~ lack of communication.

One myth is that the Board of Trus-

V tees is a active decision-making organ.

This is impossible because the Board
meets infrequently. And the legal au-
thority of the Board is delegated to

-the Chancellor and the staff of the
' University. -

A _.Membership on the Board of Trus-
tees, however, can be abused. And here,

. Sen. Fleming is a shining example. He

is using his dual position of State Sen-
ator and’ Trustee to enhance his polit-
ical prestige at the expense of this Uni-
versity’s autonomy. This, in our view,
is undesirable conduct for a member
of the Board of Trustees.

The role of Board of Trustees, nev-
ertheless, concerns the financial area
of the University. They have little to
do, for the most part, with curriculum,
disciplinary decisions, and the admin-
istrative functioning of the University.

It was unfortunate that more peo-
ple at Monday’s Teach-In were not
aware of these facts. This ignorance
caused a great deal of name calling
and list reading that was essentially
wasteful.

Despite some myth making and
some emotional tirades, there is an ele-

 

Black Fight Aired

Editor, The Pitt News:

The pious legalisms in Daniel McNary‘s
letter must not be left unchallenged. His
martial appeal to our reverence for “the
fundamental concepts of democracy” is a
cloak that all too quickly covers the less
than democratic nature of our society. Be-
cause.we can no longer afford to play that
game of hide and seek, we must look at
things as they are.

I assume that in choosing to speak
about “rights" Mr. McNary was irritat-
ed by talk he may have heard about black

‘ ._ people struggling for their inalienable

human rights (“. . . life. liberty, and the
pursuit of happiness . .  is how it reads.
I believe). His seemingly lucid statement
of what he judges to be the real rights
in question is impeccably abstract and,
tlgerefore, in the context given, unassail-
a e.

But while people will grant in the ab-
" stract that murder is wrong. they find it
at least justifiable in case of self-defense.
Mr. McNary says very clearly in his table
of unjust “rights" that it is wrong to com-
mit violent acts and to disrupt the Univer-
sity. I’ll buy that — in the abstract. But in
the context of reality, I disagree.

For 400 years every attempt on the part
of black Americans to gain power over

their own lives and to gain access to a "

Verbal Confrontation

ment of great significance that can be
extracted from Monday’s mass meet-
ing—it was a beginning. For the first
time the administration of this institu-
tion was on the spot talking to students.
Monday’s meetingwas, to be sure, an
intellectual confrontation. Minds and
emotions clashed. And all the 500 peo-
ple packed in 121 KF were doing their
won thing in a silent or verbal fashion.
It was communication at its best — ver-
.bal confrontation.

The verbal confrontation Monday
certainly did not resolve many issues
of student-faculty concern, but it did
provide a mechanism for any student —
of any ideological persuasion — to air
his views. This, in our view, opens the
upward lines of communication in the
University hierarchy. And this provides
a mutual service: it allows students the
chance to participate in a dialogue with
key staff of the University and it pro-
vides a mechanism for the administra-
tion to keep tabs on the student senti-
ment. Above all, this sort of meeting,
may in the future, create mutual trust
and respect among the members of the
tri-partate family of the University.

Open meetings focusing on dialogue
between University officials, faculty
and students can only improve the hor-
rendous communications problem on
this campus.

The only meaningful solution to

University communicative problems, we

believe, is to institutionalize open meet-
ings, with a standard format, between
the administration, faculty, and stu-
dents. These meetings should be held
bi-weekly-

Without this , sort’ of communica-
tive structure the University situation’
will continue to stagnate ultimately
causing the “Oakland Conflagration.”

share of the action in this country has
been met by systematic white opposition.

‘White America has long been guilty of a
kind of physical and psychological war-
fare against black people. What we must
face is that the mechanisms of this war-
fare are to this day in good order and that
they will not soon be shut down for want
of laborers to work them.

But the irony is that. by waking up all
white Americans to our complicity in the
systematic suppression of black people.
this special fight may result in the kind of
rejuvenation that will enable us to cope
with the meaninglessness of our societys
publicized standards of political. social.
and personal morality. I agree with Mr.
McNary that the mettle of America is be-
ing tested. I

But. whereas he seems to think that the
challenge lies in making sure that the
“democratic" status 'quo is maintained
and that black people-are kept in line (this
is how it reads when you bring it into the
context of reality). I feel that the chal-
lenge lies in our learning to throw away
the crutches of bigotry and stereotype
and to build a truly humane society.

This struggle ~— to identify our prob-
lems and to learn to solve them —- is the es-
sence of education. Mr. McNary’s alterna-
tive. a docile retreat to our books. seems
a palid and inadequate substitute.

_ Sincerely.

Commuter Schmuter

 

by BRUCE LEVENSON
Staff News Editor

There is only one thing that concerns the
majority of commuters on this campus —-

' transportation.

It is for this fundamental reason that
any efforts to mobilize large numbers of
commuter support have been met with in-
difference. Most commuters must travel
great distances to reach the campus.

I would define a great
distance as any location
at least thirty minutes
traveling time from Oak-
land. Thirty minutes to
school and thirty min-
utes back home equals
an hour of commuting a
day. And I would argue
that any student who LEVENSON
must commute for at _
one hour per day cannot become too in-
terested in school affairs. '

 

IF ONE LIVES A half hour from.

school, he frequently may spend more than
an hour commuting... For he may take an-
other fifteen minutes to an hour waiting
on a bus stop. If he has a car. he must
make sure that he drives during times
when there is a minimum of traffic. On
days of bad weather a commuter is liable

‘ to spend up to twice the normal amount of

time in travel.

' If a commuter must take a certain bus
or drive at a certain hour in order to
reach home in the shortest amount of time
or at a reasonable hour, there is nothing
that will be important enough to keep him,
on campus, be it better stud ent union
facilities. meetings, lectures. or whatever.

Few commuters want to miss a nice
warm dinner with the family when "they
haven’t been home since eight or “iiine
o’clock-in the morning. Few commuters
want to arrive home after ten p.m. when
they.must do homework and arise early
the following morning. It is this basic pro-
blem of transportation that keeps com-
miiters inactive in University affairs or, if
you will, apathetic.

Therefore, the only issues that are of
real concern to most commuters are issues
of transportation: mass transis services. but
passes, and especially, parking;

derstand and solve the problems of com-
muters, oddly enough, is the Commuter As-

majority of commuters will never become a
part of the inner-workings of campus life.‘

A letter was recently sent to all com-
muting students from the Association. This
is the only communication thusfar issued
from this organization since September.
What has this organization been doing for
the past six months? Nothing as far as I
have been able to ascertain, and I am a
commuter.

The letter represents a feeble attempt
by the Commuter Association to become a
part of the “student power" movement. It
refers to prices in the Towers cafeteria.
Dormitory students pay an average of one
dollar per meal. according to the letter,
while commuting students must pay $1.80.
The letter seeks support in efforts to re-
duce the commuter price to that of dorm
students. ‘

w NOT ONLY IS this a petty issue as far
as commuters are concerned, but a ludi-
crous one. How often ‘do commuters eat in
the cafeteria? Sepaking for myself and the
commuters that I know, not more than five
to ten meals per term. On the other hand,
dorm students pay for approximately 150
meals per term in the cafeteria. It is a sim-
ple economic fact that those who purchase
a product or service in large quantity pay
a cheaper price than those who patron-
ize occasionally. Aside from the economic
argument, commuters really don’t have
much interest in cafeteria prices. This poor-
ly contrived issue represents a remarkable
amount of stupidity on the part of the As-
sociation.

In October, I presented a proposal to
Commuter Association President Jack La-
Pietra for resolving part of the terrible
Oakland parking problem. “That’s a great
idea, Bruce,” he told me. He promised
to schedule a meeting with his officers. ad-
visor, and myself to work on the propos-
al. Now it is five months later, and, inspite
of my constant reminders, this meeting has
not yet been scheduled. Furthermore, the
Commuter Association has not done any-
thing to attempt to deal with the parking pro
blem.

INSTEAD, .to make it look as if they
are doing something, the Association has
created this ridiculous issue about cafeteria
meals. Why is the Commuter Association
afraid to deal with the only real concern
of commuters —— parking?

Fallacy

room? None of these things? Then what
was it hero? What made you kill — you,
who once believed all human life to be
sacred?

God knows I tried to keep you from do-
ing it, but there was such a different qual-
ity about you, something so determined that
even I couldn’t help you. How could you
kill hero?

AH,,SO THATS IT. You saw all your
friends falling dead-around, so you ap-
pointed yourself God, and took life away
from seven men. But hero, now that your
vengeance is appeased, don’t you see that
you are nothing more than a murderer?

Remember the look on the face of the last __
one. as you fired your rifle. Not a look of '

hate, animosity, or even defiance, but be-

-wilderment and utter hopelessness.

Seven men. hero . . . . Seven men dead
because of you. Young virile men like your-
self; with homes. families, and children.

So now you are honored instead of dis-
pised. You are on top of the world instead
of under its feet. People love you. They
are proud of you. Now you can live with
your fellow man, but you also have to live
with me . . . . .. Hero.

Some think that the YWCA is
the most dynamic organization on
campus. A lot of it has to do with
the group’s director. Sheila Schu-
maker, a youthful, vibrant. inter-
ested person who throws herself
into everything she and the Y un-
dertake.

SHEILA SHUMAKER

“I find my work ideal,” com-
mented Miss'Schumaker in an
interview with The Pitt News
Monday. “It’s a challenge and
never dull.”

Since the time that Sheila,«as
everyone calls her, took over as‘.
director in September of 1967, the
YWCA has taken on a new image
at the "University. At least half
the members are male and ac-
cording to the director, the
“Christian” initial of YWCA does
_not limit membership at all.

“Religion doesn’t come unto
things,” explained Sheila. “Not
in a formal way. There are Jews,
Atheists and Christians alike in
the ‘Y." The ‘Y’ is nothing reli-
gious in the traditional sense;ywe
are interested in human values,

other people and injustices.”

Under the direction of Sheila
and the efforts of its broad mem-
bership, the work of the YWCA
touches a great number of areas
such as sex and sexuality. sensi-
tivity training and activities in-
volving international and Amer-
ican students. “No longer just tea
parties and service projects,” the
Y has a special interest in work-
ing out the Black-White problems.

A number of projects deal with
the issue of white racism in the
University. “We’ve started stu-

dent dialogue teams.” said the Y

director, “They are made up of
students who visit the dorms in
groups of two. What they try to
do is understand the white ra-

help other students understand ra-

Americans.”

The Y here works extensively
with the University and City Min-
istries (UACM) on the problem
of communication breakdown be-
tween blacks and whites. Together
with Carnegie-Mellon Universi-
ty, they sponsor Black and White
Workshops, groups of blacks and
whites who get together for a
whole weekend to hash out pro-
blems. ~

As Sheila said, the Y here is not
a knitting circle, but has become
a moving social action group and
committed itself to an involve-
ment with community problems.

HEAVY BATTLING under the boards marked the first contest between the

Losing to Pitt doesn’t set too well with West Virginia folk.
so cage coach Buzz Ridl and his squad can expect to face a load-
ed shotgun when they visit the Mountaineers at Morgantown tonight.

Two weeks ago. the cagers. shooting 55 percent. upset WVU. 90-

87. Since then. the Mountaineers
(9-11) have lost two of three
games. They’ll be rarin’ to get a
hold of the hoopsters .tonight.

“They‘ll be after us. after we
upset them." warned Ridl. “I
think it would be wise. though.
to go basically with the way we
worked here. That’ll be the plan
we start with. 

In the first game, however,
Ridl got the type of shooting that
has been lacking most of the sea-
son. Mike Cladwell pumped home
25 points, shooting 10-18 from the

P.

ml’-Ioping For Repeat

floor, while Bob Petrini added 14
on 7-10.

“I imagine they’ll (WVU) con-
centrate on defensing Caldwell.
said Ridl. “They‘ll bear down on
him. He moved well. though, and
got himself open. The rest of us
helped to get him those shots.
We'll have to help him again.

Ridl figures that West Virgin-
ia’s home advantage is bigger
than most home teams usually
have. “The average difference in
being home or away is about
eight points." he commented. “At
a place like West Virginia. it's
more like 10 or 12."

The win over WVU January 28,
was the cagers first in their last
ten tries. Tonight they’ll be try-
ing to break another Mountain-
eer string - five consecutive home
victories. The last visiting hoop-
ster win was in 1963, 69-68.

Ridl may have an added burden
tonight in trying to repeat last
month’s upset. Forward Rom
McFarland. missed practice Mon-
day with a heavy chest cold and
may miss tonight’s game. The
coach would counter with sopho-
more Mike Riggle in McFarland‘s
place.

"I would go with Riggle be-
cause of his height and strength.

Cubs Visit Highly-Touted Mounties

However, tonight the Cubs meet
the Little Mountaineers in the
hills of West Virginia and not at
the top of cardiac hill. Assist-.
ant coach Jim Monroe remarked
that a visiting team seldom notch-
es an easy win at West Virginia‘s
jam—packed Field House.

But it is not impossible for a
visiting team to win on the Moun-
taineer home court. even if the
team is from Pittsburgh. About
one week ago, the Duquesne
Dukes’ freshmen team eked out a
93-91 victory at Morgantown.

The leading scorer for the Little
Mountaineers has been the Penn-
sylvania All-Stater from Laurel
Highlands, Will Robinson. Last
year he averaged 28 ppg. and
was considered second only to
Denny Wuycik among Pa.’s school-
boys. This season he is averaging
over 22 ppg. and almost four as-
sists per game.

In addition to Robinson, the
Mountaineers have acquired some
of the most highly-rated talent in
the East. In fact. before the Cubs
slipped past the Mounties two
weeks ago. they were rated as the
sixth best freshman team in the
nation.

Curtis Price. a 6-2 guard who
was chosen as the top player in
West Virginia last year. leads the
team in rebounds. Coach Bucky
Waters also recruited Billy Wells
and John Wooten. both West Vir-
ginia All-Staters. Gary Browne.
a 6-6 forward who averaged more
than 30 ppg. in Washington. D.C.
a year ago. is scoring 19 ppg.
and seven footer Mike Heitz is
shooting at better than 60’; from
the floor. Yet. Heitz still hasn‘t
fully recovered from mononuc-
leosis.

Despite the wealth of talent on
a foreign court, the Cubs are trav-
eling to West Virginia with the

- idea of putting two good periods of

play back to back, a rare feat thus
far.

Even in the Cub victory against
the Mountaineers, the squad had
to pull out the game with a fur-
ious second half rally. The Cubs
outscored and outhustled WVU
42-27 in the last stanza as Paul
O’Gorek pulled down 18 rebounds
and scored 16 points in the one
point victory.

 

Downes in practice. but we'd be
giving away too much height."
Riggle. incidentally. played a big
role in the first game against West
Virginia this year as he connect-
ed on both ends of two crucial
one—and-one foul shot situations
in the closing minutes.

It was also in that first game
that West Virginia got a boost
from one of its sophomores, who
has gone on to _gain more playing
time for the Mounties since then -
Skip Kintz. Kintz, who averaged
28.7 ppg as a freshman, scored
14 against the cagers.

“He’s sort of moved more into
their line-up since then." remark-
ed Ridl. “He’s been high scorer
in several games for them." In-
cluded among those games is 28
points for Kintz against George
Washington.

The Hoopsters are currently 4-
14. Most recently they lost a good
chance for a win against Buck-
nell. At one point in the first half
against the Bisons. they had a 13-
point lead.

“We weren’t quite patient
enough moving the ball in the
second half,” reviewed thecoach.
“We only made six of 21 shots,
and a number of those were fairly
easy shots that just didn’t drop
for our boys. And Bucknell was
really hot in the second half.
Frankly, that (Bob) Greenwood
(23 points) was a lot better than
his reputation.”

Gym Team Rates Good Shot
At Second Victory Tonight;
Plays Host to Slippery Rock

The gymnasts are still looking for the second win of the sea-
son, but according‘ to. sophomore Lowell Meek, there’s a good
chance that the team may pick up win number two tonight when
they host Slippery Rock College in the Trees Hall at 7:30 p.m.

“We‘re sure hoping for the win.” explained Meek. “It should be a
close contest, but I think we can take it. Most of the guys think so too."

The gymnasts’ only victory this season came against West Virginia
by six-tenths of a point. but this past week-end the West Virginia gym-
nasts edged Slippery Rock by an identical six-tenths of a point. “You
can‘t always go on that comparing of scores." Meek continued. “We
were really hitting when we faced West Virginia.

Meek emphasized that the team will probably need a fairly high
score to win tonight, but also emphasized the fact that several of the
boys will be going in events which they haven’t worked on before.

“We're trying to fill spots that Bernie Jesiolowski held down.“
Meek explained. Jesiolowski was injured in the Massachusetts meet
earlier this season. and his absence has left a void on the depthless

squad.

Jim Bilec has been filling in for Jesiolowski on the parallel bars
and Phil Lilly has been working on the long horse vault. but as yet there
is no replacement for him in the floor exercise.

Slippery Rock defeated the gymnasts last year, but the varsity had
only four men competing last season. Slippery Rock is also reported to
have several boys out with injuries and this should be advantageous for
the. varsity. “I think they've lost a couple of their top performers,”

Meek added.

“I think we can beat them.” he continued. "TheV‘re just about our

speed.” — By HARTLE

Lavery Plays Giant Killer Role 

by MARTHA HARTLE

Pat Lavery has set no per-
sonal goals for himself in the
Eastern wrestling champion-
ships that March. but he’s already
cast some doubt on the hopes of
a few rival Eastern contenders.

In Saturday’s match with
Franklin and Marshall, Lavery
was pitted against last year’s
Eastern runner-up, John Homiak,
in the 137-pound bout. Homiak‘s
coach noted that this is to be
John’s big year. and that Homiak
himself has set the EIWA title as
his goal. Lavery decisioned Hom-
iak, 9-7, Saturday, and according
to varsity coach Dave Adams it
was not only a big win for Pat,
but also an incentive for the team,
which went on to blank F&M. 40-0.

Lavery, however, has a humble
explanation for his win over the
Franklin and Marshall grappler.
“Homiak was out of shape,” ex-
plained Lavery. “And this was
only his second time wrestling
down at 137. And he had just had
a long layoff for exams. If he
would have been in shape, he
would have beat me."

But despite all the excuses,
Lavery did defeat Homiak, and
he has also beaten others. Lavery
is currently 5-1 on the season in
dual meet competition, with his
only loss coming at the hands of
Navy’s Dennis Stahl, 5-3. In ad-
dition to the win over Homiak, he
holds decisions over highly rated
Dave Reese of Maryland and op-
ponents from Michigan, Temple
and Clarion.

Lavery rates Stahl as the tough-
est he’s faced so far, but he indi-
cated that Jeff Leeman from Le-
heigh may be the best in the East
this year.

“Stahl was strong; similar‘ to
Homiak. But he moved down to
130 in a recent match and may be
wrestling there in the Easterns.
Leeman wasn’t too good last year,
but he’s much better this season,”
Lavery explained.

Leeman is a junior, and was
4-3 last year. One of his defeast
last season was to Ron Schucert
of the varsity. I

“I can’t say anything about
placing in the Easterns myself,”
continued the sophomore from?
German Township. “There are too:
many guys, many from schools
"we don’t even wrestle, such as
Princeton. They’re all tough
guys.” . .

A former WPIAL champ, Lav-

‘F age’ Tapped to
Improve Defense

One by one, head football‘
coach Carl DePasqua is putting
his staff together for the coming
-season. Yesterday, his third addi-
tion was announced: Serafino
“Foge” Fazio.

Fazio, 29, is the youngest mem-
ber of the staff and will serve as
defensive line coach. He joins
previous members Lou “Bimbo”
Cecconi and Tom Fletcher. Four
more assistants are expected to be
named in the near future—-tw’o of-
fensive, one defensive, and one
full-time freshman coach.

The new coach most recently
worked at Harvard, where last
season’s defense was third-ranked
nationally against scoring and
13th nationally in total defense.
The Panther defense yielded 397
points last year and was not na-
tionally ranked. ‘

Before joining Harvard. Fazio
coached at Boston University (his
frosh were 5-1) and‘ headed up
Coraopolis High School for two
years (13-4,-1. one Ohio Valley

ery lists strength as his biggest
asset on the mat, as opposed to
moves or speed. “I don’t have
many moves,” he explained, “and
I’m not fast.”

Since the beginning of this
term, Pat has been wrestling at
137, rather than 152, and it’s been
advantageous as far as strength
goes. Prior to the exam break he
was going at 152, and he wrestled
at 152 all last season as a fresh-
man, when he posted a 7-3 record.

“I would rather wrestle at 137,”

The only major change in Pat’s
wrestling this season over last has
been the switch in weight class.
“Now I’m wrestling at the weight
I should be in. I can move bet-
ter now. I want to stay at 137.”

As far as the rest of the season
goes, the grapplers have four re-
maining dual matches, and Lav-
ery is expecting tough competi-
tion in three of the four. With
only one home match remaining,
Lavery indicated that he’ll miss
the home crowds. “The crowd
he commented. “The guys are my helps a. lot, especially at home"
size there. At 152, the guys seem -matches. Ihate to go away.”
