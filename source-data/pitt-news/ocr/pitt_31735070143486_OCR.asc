Nguyen, known as -“Ricky”

Emil Lester, formerly the own-

er- of City Cafe on Market Square

p Downtown, said he came to know
Nguyen through another frequent
customer, who often cared for
Nguyen and received some of
Nguyen’s Vietnamese cooking in
return. _

“I had a cafe Downtown, and
my place was the kind of place
where people went to talk,” Lester
said.

It was in talking with his fre-
quent customer, whom he called
“Charles,” that Lester learned of
Nguyen and became familiar with
his poor mental health and finan-
cial problems. 4

Considering all of Nguyen’s
obstacles, Lester believes that the
policeman didn’t need to shoot to
kill.

“Ricky was 100 pounds. The

policeman could’ve puffed and he
would’ve fallen over,” he said.

years.

While fulfilling these leadership
positions, Placone recalled how Jared
bettered and challenged others and led
with an unwavering example.

“He had the unique ability to give
insightful advice, and he was particu-
larly adept at giving advice without
you realizing he was doing so,” Pla-
cone said.

“His character was defined by
strength, loyalty and passion for life,
and I can say without hesitation that he
epitomized the very notion of brother-
hood.”

Additionally, Placone said Jared
helped him to understand when to take
things seriously and when not to worry
about the details.

“Through his example, I learned
to keep going and never give in sim-
ply due to adverse circumstances,” he
said.

“He did not want to waste time
making the same mistakes, and his life
was very much defined by maximizing
every moment to make the best out of
daunting challenges.”

In addition to sports and his frater-
nity, another one of Jared’s interests
included watching the television show
“Lost,” Placone said.

Jared discussed the show’s complex
mythology with Placone through back
and forth e-mails during their free time
at work.

“He loved to rehash theories about
the show and its direction with any
other ‘Lost’ fanatic,” he said.

Placone said that Jared, who ma-
jored in communication and Span-

DAqy28,2008

ish, planned to teach English in Peru
through the TEFL program starting in
January 2009.

He already started the process with
the certification program and spent lots
of time researching where he wanted to
teach in Latin America and what pro-
gram would be best to do so.

He also recently applied for his
passport and was slated to leave for
Peru in August.

Although he never obtained the op-
portunity to teach in Latin America,
Jared’s friends will always remember
his determination and drive that led
him in that direction.

“As far as his strengths go, he never
gave up on anything,” Fidler said. “He
was one of the most determined people
I’ve ever known. He had an awesome
sense of humor and could make almost
anyone laugh.”

Steve Grisanti, one of Jared’s fra-
ternity brothers who was in the same
pledge class as him, said that Jared was
one of his only friends that he could
fully trust.

“He never wanted anything in re-
turn,” he said. “He was always willing
to sacrifice himself for the betterment
of his friends. I think of him as one of
my best friends, but so does everyone
else who was close to him.”

ONE DAY CLOSER TO $4.00 / GALLON OF GASOLINE

~ California overturns
gay marriage ban

On May 15, California’s

 Supreme Court overturned the
; state’s ban on gay marriage,
’ a decision that could allow

same—sex couples in the state

i to legally marry.

' On June 14, after a provi-

 sional period of 30 days dur-

ing which the court’s ruling

 takes effect, legal clerks in the

,state would be authorized to.

i‘ give marriage licenses to any
 couple wishing one, regard-
: less of their respective gen-

1
1
t

ders.

In many ways, this is a
huge step forward for people
fighting for equality in U.S.
marriage laws. The only other
state to allow same—sex mar-
riages is Massachusetts, which
did so in 2004; the rest of the

 United States remains woeful-
f ly behind the times in’ regard
i to treating same-sex couples

equally to traditional couples.
Pennsylvania is a perfect

 example.

Although the state already

7 has a law that limits marriage

to a union of one man and one
woman — the 1996 Defense
of Marriage Act — some leg-
islators want to strengthen the

-_ ban by having it added to the
it state constitution. As of now,
; the bill is presumed to be dead

in committee in the Pennsyl-
vania Senate, but it could be
enacted again in the next ses-

; sion.

Even if the bill does pass

_ through both the state House

and Senate, it would also
have to get a major_ity in a
statewide referendum before
being applied to the constitu-
tion. In contrast, California’s

 constitution can be amended
 by a simple majority vote in a
" statewide referendum, some-
' thing that some groups are at-

tempting to do in November

3 to re-enact a ban. This would
-V also keep the court decision

from coming into effect until

the referendum was held.

It’s almost shameful that,’
even after the California Su-.
preme Court ruled that same- j
sex marriage should be legal, '
some groups would attempt to 3
keep it from reaching that sta— 
tus. 3

If the state Supreme Court 
has acknowledged that same- 
sex couples have the same 
rights as traditional couples,i
they should be granted all the 
benefits of those rights, in- 
cluding the right to marry. 

And if that right isn’t 
granted, then it’s clear thati
same—sex couples are discrim— 
inated against in a way that?
evokes the same problems we
had as a society in the 1960s.
Discriminating against gays ;
and lesbians purely becausei
of their sexuality is no more
justified than discriminating
against a black person solely
because of his or her race.

These are problems that 
were supposedly solved al- 
most a generation ago, yet j
we’re still dealing with the C
same issues purely because
of backward thinking based
in personal belief and convic-
tion instead of legal realities.
By the letter of the law, there
is no rule against same—sex
couples getting married un-
less the state has made it so. If 
these laws were applied to any 
other social group, they would 
be immediately lambasted asj
discriminatory and insensi- 4
tive. It should be no different i
for gay couples. [

The California court’s rul— 
ing should stand and allow 
people to marry, regardless of 
sexual orientation. And Penn— 
sylvania, along with the other 
states, should realize that do- 
ing anything other than whati
California and Massachusetts 
have done is discrimination 1
and ﬂies in the face of both:
equality and logic. ‘

It’s Pronounced ‘Lee:’ The Immigrant Experience

Nationality is lost in translation

     
 

by Lewis Lehe
Co/u/mullt I

The other day, I went down
to_ Migraciones in Buenos Aires,
Argentina, to get my visa, which
affirms I’m a resident of la Repub-
lica. Finally, the English lessons
I’ve been teaching for $5 per hour
are legal. I no longer risk an ironic
deportation ﬁ'om Latin America to
the United States.

Now that Pm legal enough to
come forward, this colunm begins

a series titled “The Immigrant Ex- 4

perience.” It tells about my trials
and triumphs, as an immigrant
here in Buenos Aires, To_day’s
topic: ancestry.

I arrived at Migraciones late
because the directions said, “It’s
next to the giant Sheraton.” But
nearby forest ﬁres covered Bue-
nos Aires with a cloud of smoke,
so everything more than a hun-
dred feet away tumed invisible. It
was even thicker than Argentina’s
usual haze from cigarette smoke.
Because of the smoke, I couldn’t
see if there was a huge statue or
not, but I was pretty satisﬁed any-
way that Migraciones was sort of
on an island.

They had me stand in a long

line to photocopy my passport. 1

Surveying the rainbow of my

fellows from -Bolivia, Paraguay,
Peru, Uruguay and just about ev-
ery other country, I felt the prom-
ise that la Republica holds made
tangible for immigrants like us.
We’ll face low wages, union vio-
lence, smoke clouds, smoking
crowds, racism and the world’s
highest rate of pedestrian trafﬁc
casualties, but none of us will ever
have to see fat people or less—than—
beautiful women ever again. For
this, we photocopy.

In line, a tall man broke ranks
and approached me. He asked
hopefully, in crude‘ Spanish, “You

. speak Russian, no?”

We immigrants hate it when
people think they’re sure where
we come from just by looking at
us. For Hispanics in the United
States, that place is Mexico. For
me in Argentina, that place is
Eastern Europe. Even more so
than Russians like the man in line,
Argentines are sure that I’m East— -
em European. I

I never talk about ancestries. I
think other people talk about them,
though I’m not sure, because, for
me, hearing someone say they are
“one eighth Basque and . . . ” is not
a different mental state than coma-
tose. It’s very boring.

. Given I don’t bring it up, it’s
eerie how often Argentines feel

pressed to guess my ancestry. I
would feel like a mystical crea-
ture, like a narwhal, maybe, but
they point it out like spinach stuck
in my teeth.

“Perdon, che, you’re Slovak,
no? It shows, loco.” ' ~

“You’re Argentine, no, che?
It shows, because you called me
Slovak, tipo, without any prec-
edent, pi .”

I lost faith in ancestry when
I fell off my skateboard in ninth
grade. My scrapes and cuts
swelled up fat and turned pink.
When I went to the doctor he said,

“These are keloid‘ scars. They’re —

typically only found in African
Americans.” Later, a doctor told
me, “The blood doesn’t circulate
in your hands or feet or nose,‘ be-
cause you have bad ' Raynaud’s
Disease. It’s typically only found
in Jewish women.” Ifancestry was
ﬁckle enough to give me fat scars
and cold hands, with no compen-
satory resistance to sunburn or a
free trip to Israel, I was opposed to
it. I still am.

Ancestry especially troubles
immigrants from the United States.
American white people are like a
supreme pizza, with ingredients
from all over Europe — and, ap-
parently, sometimes Africa. Plus,
it sounds awkward saying, “I’m

US. foreign policy toward Saudi Arabia hypocritical

by Dan Camarda
Columtzidt

Slipping by the mainstream me-
dia coverage of President George
W. Bush’s recent trip to the Mid-
dle East was an important docu-
ment released after Bush met with
Saudi Arabian leaders, titled “Fact
Sheet: Strengthening Diplomatic
Ties with Saudi Arabia: United
States And Saudi Arabia Improve
Peace And Stability In The Region
Through Nuclear Cooperation.”

At ﬁrst, the document seems
benign until the fourth bullet of the
plan. It states, “This agreement will
pave the way for Saudi Arabia’s
access to safe, reliable fuel sources
for energy reactors and demon-
strate Saudi leadership as a positive
non-proliferation model for the re-
gion.”

- This is absolutely unbelievable
and unacceptable. Bush has used
his latest trip to the Middle East to
further his campaign against Iran
while establishing close ties with
Saudi Arabia, which has done as
much, if not more, than what Bush

has blasted Iran for doing. For the
last two years, the Bush adrnin—
istration has been charging Iran
with various offenses in the Middle
East.

First, the statements issued by
the White House alleged that Iran
was developing nuclear technol-
ogy for the construction of nucle-
ar arms. These statements were
proved to be misleading and false
once the International Atomic
Energy Agency, the authority on
nuclear technology, issued its re-
port outlining the cooperation be-
tween the Iranian government and
the IAEA to insure that the nuclear
plants built were for civilian use
only. Next, reports surfaced that
Iran was arming and funding ter-
rorists including insurgents in Iraq.
However, the lack of evidence
connecting insurgents to Iran made
those reports less credible and pos-
sibly false. ’

A 2002 report submitted to the
United Nations Security Council,
titled “Terrorism Financing: Roots
and trends of Saudi terrorism ﬁ-
nancing,” outlined the vast funding

of terrorist group al Qaeda by Saudi
Arabia. Al Qaeda was responsible
for the Sept. 11 attacks and after

the reason the United States is so
disrespected globally and is doing

In December 2006, USA To-
day reported that “Private Saudi
citizens are giving millions of dol-
lars to Sunni insurgents in Iraq and
much of the money is used to buy
weapons, including shoulder ﬁred
anti-aircraft missiles.” This is ex-
actly what the United States has
accused of Iran. Instead of calling
out Saudi Arabia and demanding it
cease the funding of terrorists and
insurgents in Iraq, Bush is meet-
ing with Saudi leaders and assur-
ing them of their importance in the
Middle East

This is exactly the type of pol-
icy that Bush called similar to the
appeasement of Hitler in the 1930s.
According to Bush, the funding of
terrorists by Saudi Arabia is ﬁne,
while Iran’s actions are unaccept-

enough. That’s why Southerners
don’t care as much about being
Scots-Irish or whatever. They get

- to be Southern, which is enough

“special-ness” for such salt of the
earth folk.

In the United States, we hold
on to our grandparents’ homelands
—- cooking pierogies or listening
to spirituals. But when you’re
displaced from the United States,
the identity you feel drawn to is
simply American. That’s because
it’s the 99 percent of your life that
you don’t have anymore, not the
1 percent of your life that was the

anymore.

Now that I’m here, I want to be
more American — reg’lar ’merica
American. I love explaining how
many crazy rules football has —
especially how you hardly ever
touch the ball with your foot —
and derive some weird satisfac-
tion from saying that soccer is like
our sixth most popular sport. “My

abuelos fought the Axis powers,”

I say, adding, “And servants make
me uncomfortable.”

Here, I don’t celebrate being
Slovak  or Serbian or Polish
or Russian or Bulgarian. For one
thing, I don’t know if I’m Eastern
European at all. My mom says that

difference is ancestral.

But given such groups never
ﬂocked to Alabama, it’s likely that
my genes randomly conspired to
build me how Argentines picture
the Slavic peoples. More likely
still, I just look different in a con-
sistent way, a way that seems like
there’s a place where the people
must look like me, but of which
the Argentines are unfamiliar, and

more than enough. To quote the
Fact Sheet, “The U.S. will help the
Saudis develop both human and
infrastructure resources in accor-
dance with Intemational Atomic
Energy Agency guidance and stan-
dards.” Another car has been added
to the foreign policy train wreck
that is the Middle East. Aiding a
terrorist-supporting, unstable na-
tion in the construction of nuclear
power facilities is taking a massive
leap in the face of potential region-
al war.

In 1981, Israel bombed alleged
nuclear facilities in Iraq. Then in
2007, Israel launched missiles into
Syria at what was believed to be
the construction of a nuclear plant
Lately Israel has been using rheto-
ric that implies similar action will

be taken in Iran. How will Israel
react to the construction of nuclear
plants in a -Saudi Arabia, another
state that does not recognize the
right of Israel to exist?

United States’ concerns. VV1th
troubled relations between Wash-
ington, Moscow and Beijing, and
China’s and Russia’s support of
Iran, the U.S.-aided construction of
nuclear capabilities in Saudi Ara-
bia will be seen as a continuation of
unﬁiendly U.S. policies. How long
before tensions result in action?

Bush carmot be allowed to pur-
sue this policy. It is intolerable and
perilous to U.S. citizens and is not
a partisan issue.

Rather, it is a poor policy built
from unsound judgment that will
undoubtedly lead to long—tenn
conflict. Should Bush continue to
pursue what was outlined in the
Fact Sheet, we must prepare ‘for
widespread conﬂict in the Middle
East for years to come.

Nliddle-aged Women passionately pro~Clinton

    

by Molly Green
Calum/ziat

   

It was a sad day for 13-year-old
girls everywhere when David Cook’s
spiky hair victory danced across the
stage into American Ido1—hood last
week .

Yes, despite his nauseatingly
wholesome rendition of Neil Dia-
rnond’s “America” and calculated
boy-nextdoor appeal, a. (supposed)
Idol-ﬁontrunner David Arehuleta lost
tothetightlycladrockerafterarecord-
breaking number of votes were dialed
and texted in Cook’s favor.

What, then, was the secret to
Cook’s success? What force was
strong enough to deter even the seem-
ingly indorrritable preteen demo-
graphic, rabid, Jonas—brother-loving
psychos that they are?

Hint: It’s also the same group that
wasadecidingfactorinthe2006mid—
term elections and a leading inﬂuence
in politics for the last 24 years: middle-
aged women

Though the female demographic
as a whole has outvoted men con-
sistently since the 1984 presidential

 
 
  

 
   
 

election, according to the U.S. Census
Bureau, it is the older-than—3O crowd
that demonstrated the largest gender
gap.

Generallyarepresentative (though,
admittedly stereotypical) rr1iddle—aged
American woman cares about equal-
ity in the workplace and being inde-
pendent (also, terrible music like Bon
Jovi). These are, after all, the women
who listened to their mothers’ and
grandmothers’ stories of being denied
the right to vote, the women who wit-
nessed the ﬁrst woman appointed to
the Supreme Court and the passage of
landmark legislation like Title IX and
the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

Yet according to a Wornen’s
Donor Network nationwide survey,
when voting in the 2006 mid—terrn
elections, women felt that the issues
ofthewarinIraq,healthcarearrdthe
economy were most important, and
typically ferrrale-championed issues
like wornen’s equality and abortion
were rated as much less important

Despite these gender-neutral inter-
ests, women do, however, continue to
feel that placing fellow women in po-
sitions of power is a top priority. Ac-

cording to the WDN poll, 56 percent
of women felt strongly about the im-
portance of the ﬁrst woman Speaker
of the House.

Similarly,. in the current Demo
cratic primary, a signiﬁcant portion of
women are pushing their support in
the direction of Sen. Hillary Clinton,
hoping for that ﬁnal equalizer. a fe-
male president

With what looks like Clinton’s
impending political doom, however,
there is a lingering question about
where those votes will go.

AccordingtoaMareh Gallup poll,
28 percent of Clinton supporters —
the majority of these older women —
would vote for Sen John McCain if
Sen. Barack Obarna is the nominee.

Frankly, this makes no sense, es-
pecially when you take into account
that Obama and Clinton’s positions
on most policies are near identical.

Really, I think there are only two
possible explanations for ﬂris kind of
behavior:

First, perhaps these results stem
from the bitterness of losing, the
typical if-I-can’t-have-it-no-one-can
philosophy. The second possibility is

    
    

that the Clintonites were always plan-
ning on voting for the Democratic
candidate (whomever it should be),
but were using the poll as a fear-tactic,
hoping to scare middle-of—the-roaders
back to Hillary.

(There is a third option that I’ve
optirrristically chosen to disregard,
which is, of course, plain old stupid-
ity).
_Iftheﬁrstoptionisconect,Iam
still left wondering what is so drasti-
cally dilferent about Clinton ﬁorn
Obarna that it would prompt someone
to vote for the opposing party, and
once‘again,Ikeepcomingbacktothe
gendercard.

Hillary supporters were outraged, ”

for example, when The National
Abortion Rights Action Leagues Pro-
Choice America political action com-
mittee, or NARAL, endorsed Barack
Obama and not Clinton.

After all, how could Obarna, a
man, possibly represent ﬂre interests
of women and, oh my goodness, after
amove like this they will never donate
to that anti-ferninist NARAL again!

In actuality, Obarna has the same
views on abortions as Clinton, so

much sothatthecandidateshadtoar-
gue over who voted in support of pro-
choice legislation more often rather
than over the policy itself.

With no real reason to diiferentiate

‘the two candidates, it seems that these

poll results and other I’ll-vote—for-
McCain ultimatums made by Clinton
supporters (and I acknowledge that
notallofthesesupportersareferni-
nists or even women) are a collabora-

tive statement of deﬁance, an electoral '

middle ﬁnger that says: If you do not
support Clinton, you are not a true
advocate for women’s rights. Sup-
port Obarna, and you might as well be
excitedly burning copies of the Sen-
eca Falls Declaration of Sentiments in
your King Henry VIII-poster—riddled
basement.

It’s a passionate message that will
certainly pack a punch in November,
but is it really in the best interest of
those Clinton supporters?

Unless they want another over-
extended stay in Iraq and other Re-
publican shenanigans, the answer is a
resounding “no.”

Ford even has the

nothing else in “Kingdom of the

Certainly there is enough ac-
tion -in Steven T Spielberg’s latest

: over-stuffed thrill ride to give the

ﬁlm a pulse. Indy swings from

and survives a nuclear blast in’

Unfortunately, the rest of the

' and is suspected of having ties to V

the Soviets by the government.

. The Red Scare themes are typi-

cally mild Spielberg cliches with
Patriot Act overtones.

As these political jabs quickly
ﬁzzle out and amount to nothing,
they serve as the best use of fore-
shadowing in “Crystal Skull.”
Spielberg ‘ attempts to build the

same mystery and awe he pro-

duced in the other Indy ﬁlms, but

he apparently ' spent too much

creating dazzling effects and
stunts with minimal CGI.

The sparse scenes of drama
feel like bittersweet anecdotes by

" the end of the ﬁlm. Ford and Shia

LaBeouf —— a 1950s'rebel with a

cause — are enjoyable together-

in their few scenes of dialogue

_ when they ’aren’t being chased.
on motorcycles or amphibious

vehicles.

Likewise, Cate Elanchett as a A

Soviet ‘ofﬁcer and Karen Allen’s
return as Marion Ravenwood
seem promising, but both ac-
tresses’ talents go unused.
Instead, everything gets lost
in the Amazon forest as Indy
and Mutt (LaBeouf) rescue Mary

from the Soviets and spend an
hour and a half chasing each oth-
er. While it may get your heart
racing and keep your attention,

by the end it’s as if the ﬁlm itself
were out of breath, and not the .

65-year-old Ford.

There are man-eating ants,
monkey attacks and huge water-
falls to survive that all work clas-

sically with the gags and "feats

we love to see Indy get into and

out of. “Crystal Skull” lacks the '

tender romance scenes, religious
awe and earnest sentimentalism
of the originals. Overall, it’s a
thrillride without a sense of ad-
venture. v
While there’s nothing inher-

L ently wrong with mindless sum-

mer blockbusters, “Crystal Skull”

is practically a disgrace to a script - ’,

that ‘was reportedly l0 years in

-the making. Writer David Koepp ~

claims to have taken the best
parts from several drafts,‘ and
producer George Lucas rejected
multiple versions until he found
one he thought could work. The

“We want to be the voice of

Karaoke enthusiast Raina Lee follows the
old adage 0 “write what you know,” whether
she’s dominating the stage or just having fun.

A graduate with a master’s degree in media

and ﬁlm studies,Leepubhshes the independent _.

zine “l—Up,” the ﬁrst publication "devoted to
gaming culture. She knows as much about the
karaoke scene as she does video games. She

pronounces iit “ka—ray—o—kay,” and as she re—_

lates personalstories about her exploits, she is
always laughing :— a sure sign that she has fun

_ and takes it seriously. Not too much, mind you.

“I’Ve been karaoke—ing my entire life,”

i said Lee in a recent phone interview with The

Pitt News. The book’s forward tellsuabout her
childhood love aﬁair with the Japaneseper-
forrnance art. . /

“My parents had an ancient laserdisc plaiyé

5 er andwould buy,.’50s and ’60s love songs
5 hke ‘House of the Rising Sun.’ It was a huge

part of how I grew up, and my parents think
it’s a huge part of Chinese culture.”

Karaoke gained
popularity in the Unit-
ed States in the ’80s
and ’90s but not like
Iiee expected. W '

“There were no .
books on the subject,

vision and have their

That’s Cheers, or Spice
Cafe, as it were. ,
“No one ' has ‘any
excuse not to sing,”

said Lee. “Singing is an acquired skill anyone I
_ can train for. I had a ﬁiend who went to Yale for
‘ acting, and she said she saw tone—deaf people

sing hke they’re in ‘Phantom of the Opera.”.’

Gone-” at the bar. 4 V
The book itself is a labor of love. Written
in a very conversational style, consider it sup_—

‘ plemental material to the hands-on course of‘

karaoke. Plenty of dos and don’ts abound, as
well as tips on picking the songs that ﬁt your
voice, all while sounding like you’re just sit-
ting in a bar nervously waiting your turn. It’s‘
an entertaining and surprisingly “informative
read — did you know you should tip the kara-
oke jockey? - 

While the bulk of the book may be hi~
lariously sarcastic and light—hearted, Lee does

_ cover the basics: the history, some dance ‘

moves to try (her favorites being the shim-

‘ my and the turtleneck), types of people you

meet at a session and experimentation, which

‘ is suie to open a veritable Pandora’s Box of

strange crooning. _

“I think experimentation’s a part of the
charm,” says Lee. ~“I.’ve seen people sing
‘Baby Got Back’ in Frank Sinatra style and
people rapping R&B. It results in delightful,
if not highly unusual, results.” i '

Given that many of the songs she lists as
good karaoke fodder come from the ’50s to
the ‘80s, with only a few modem hits, it would
be good to ﬂex that creativity so people will
remember you for the song. . .' ' ’

“It’s like your skill points go up, and it

. » ' shows your cre-

drawpin the audi-
ence.”

And that takes
‘practice. She does ‘
say that singing
in general is an
acquired skill, so
her book also de-
tails some prod-
ucts people can
purchase to pump
up the pipes. One
such product, a
videogame, is
Lee’s current fa-'
P vorite time waster:
“Rock Band” for
the Xbox 360.

_ Lee takes ka-
raoke seriously, but her personal philoso-
phy keeps it from becoming too serious.

she said.

After a huge publicity stunt last Thursday,
which had more than 125 volunteers freeze in
place for ﬁve minutes Downtown, the Market

Friday with the ﬁrst Stay and Play event of the

cury and Tres Lads, as’ well as Chinese lion
dancers, Polynesian ﬁre dancers, break danc-
ing, tap dancing and outdoor beer vendors.

This Friday’s Stay and Play theme is “Sum-
mer in the City” and will feature three local

bands, CK9 and the Old E Allstars, Strange—

beer vendors. VV1thout the distraction of a hol-

“Market Square is a great venue because
it’s outdoors and has plenty of unique busi-

it’s right in the heart of Downtown, so it’s a
natural spot for people to congregate no mat-

The Littman Test

The ultimate solution

for intereague play

by Adam Littman
Senior Staﬁ’ Writer

IfI used calendars and used them correctly,

I mine would read that it’s now May.

I can’t exactly say I’m all too excited about
it, but alas, there’s nothing I can do. It’s during
May that one of my least favorite sporting events
takes place.  A

I’m talking about none other than Major
League Baseball’s interleague play.

Introduced in 1997, interleague play is when

itearnsfromtheAmericanLeagueplayteams

from the National League in, wait for it, the regu-
lar season!
Oh, how did baseball go so long without it?
As a youth I knew baseball was missing
something. And for the sake of this column, my

. youth is deﬁned by 1995 and 1996, as those are
I the first years I remember following baseball.
". Those years are forever etched in my memory
j as the Golden Years of my baseball—watching
; experience.

’Twas a simpler time, when American

_ League pitchers didn’t have to hold a bat until

the World Series. Now, they have to hold bats as

L early as May, or any time they want to chuck a
jadedpieceofwoodatMikePiazza

I’ll admit it, though. When I ﬁrst heard of in-

 terleague play, I was excited.

I was only 9 in 1997, but I felt as though my

 lifelong dream had already come true.

3 But wait, you don’t like interleague play, yet
 it was your lifelong dream?
Well not exactly, conoemed reader.

I I thought ﬂue world would get interleague .
i play, in the most literal form one can think of

competition amongst diﬂerent leagues, as in the
NBA, MLB, NFL and NHL.
I yeamed for the day when my favorite ath-
letes would join forces in sports thatI didn’t grow
 to love them for playing. "

In my mind, there was absolutely no reason
Patrick Ewing and Ken Griffey Jr. shouldn’t at
least suit up for the Jets and see what they could
do. Keyshawn Johnson skating alongside Mark
Messier? I’d even watch Fox’s magical laser
hockey puck to see that

Or what if it was even better.

What if this was “BASEketball” coming to
life? That movie wasn’t released until 1998, but it
doesn’t matter. This could’ve meant the combirr—
ing of sports and their respective stars.

The revolution was ﬁnally starting. I was alive
and about to witness the greatest event in sports:
a transformation of sports into sport. A singular
word in which there were so many possibilities
for entertainment.

Baseball on ice. Football played with bas-
ketballs. Horse racing on roller blades. Hot dog

I couldn’t wait.

Sadly, my enthusiasm was wasted

Interieague play meant something much 
more boring. It was the World Series without the
drama, importance and long sleeves. It’s the All— A
Star game without the fun and superstar focus. 1

On the plus side, it more often than not also
meant viewing baseball the way it was intended: —
no Tim McCarver and Joe Buck

Well, apparently I’m in the minority on this
one. Interleague play is popular and usually in-
creases attendance for most franchises playing a

another player’s name. ‘

JH: That’s atough one to call. I’m goingto

"say that this whole experience talk that reporters

and analysts discuss doesn’t mean anything for

The Penguins are forcing plays and not play-

which led directly to Detroit goals.

-What was -Johan Franzen’s impact on
game 2?

game,andhisoneassistwasonagoalinwhich
Valtteri Filppula did all the hard work. Franzen
was about as exciting as DetIoit’s neulIal—zone
trap defense. P

NL: While Franzen’s addition to lineup
deﬁnitely boosted the talent on the Wings’ depth
chart, what was important with his addition was
fortheW1ngs’ psyche.

He seemed invisible despite his assist on their
third goal, but his presence appeared to raise the

‘level of intensity amongst his teammates.

-Is the series over?
