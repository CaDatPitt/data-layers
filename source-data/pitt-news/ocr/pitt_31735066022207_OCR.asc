Two years ago, the Inter-
fraternity Council awards ban—
quet was merely an informal
gathering held in order to dis-
tribute awards for athletic
achievements within the IFC.
This year, however, that has
changed.

The University of Pittsburgh
lnterfraternity Council held its
first annual 1987 awards ban—
quet Monday evening in the
William Pitt Grand Ballroom.
Co-chairmen of the ceremony

' were Micheal McCormick,
president of Phi Gamma Del-
ta, and David Wilcox of Sigma
Alpha Epsilon.

According to McCormick,
the IFC decided to hold a for-
mal ‘banquet with the intent of
presenting awards not only for
athletic achievements but for
other accomplishments as
well.

Among the numerous
awards presented, Lambda
Chi Alpha received the over-
all academic achievement
award.

chapter service was given to
Delta Tau Delta, the fraternity
that raised at least $20,000 for
the Harmarville Rehabilitation
Center for handicapped
people.

The award for outstanding

' Keynote speaker for the
event was D'r.‘Robert C. Hick-
ey, chairman of the bicenten-
nial commission.

Hickey commended the Pitt
fraternities for their collective

efforts in serving the commu-

nity and in stimulating its
members to reach new and

McCormick said he hoped
to see the annual banquet be-
come a strong tradition and to
see more members attend the
presentation in the future.

Students backing
Milani for director

By Jaime Keating
For The Pitt News

Various student organizations
have voiced their opinion regard-
ing the appointment of the direc-
tor of Student Activities. Four
student groups sent letters of
recommendation and petitions to
the "Office of Student Affairs in
support of Dr. Terrance Milani.

Milani is currently the associ-
ate director of Student Activities
and acting director of the William
Pitt Union. He has been the as-
sociate director since 1972. He
was appointed acting director of
the William Pitt Union when his
former boss, Andy Smith, left in
August to take a similar position
at the University of‘Texas.

The Black Action Society, the
Graduate Student Association,
the lnterfraternity Council and the
Panhellenic Association all sent
letters to Dr. Conney Kimbo, vice
president for Student Affairs, in
support of Dr. Milani after inter-

1 viewing all of the applicants.

~ ”l think it-would be a shame if

_ Dr. Milani did not get the posi-

tion,” said Tony Baldwin, ‘chair-
man of the Black Action Society.
”He is very dedicated, hard
working and has the ability to
unite the different organizations

on campus. We have worked
with him before. He is a policy
man, and [he] helps us to under-
stand it. His door has always
been open to us.”

’’I was impressed with his
familiarity with theproblems of
graduate students,” added Heide

Farra, the vice president of the
Graduate Students Professional '

Association, who "gave a good
evaluation of Milani. ”Also, I was
impressed with his leadership
with regards to student govern-
ment. We're 1,1000 strong, so
hopefully we can help him out.”

The lnterfraternity Council and
the Panhellenic Association sent

a letter and a petition favoring Dr.‘

Milani to the Office of Student
Affairs.

Noreen Cmar, president of the

Panhellenic Association, said that"

they have had good relations in
the past. She also felt that he had
the resources to do the job well,

and that he has always been there . . S

for the students.

When contacted, Dennis Don- F ._
ham, Kimbo’s assistant, refused..,tog  ;;{
comment on the letters. Kim‘bo".is_ . 
currently out of town. He will. ’_ it
return today, when he is expect- ‘ S

ed to make the announcement of
who was appointed.

Nesti facing more
pressure to resign

By Jonathan D. Berr
Staff Writer

The 10 tenured officers of Du-
quesne’s Faculty Senate have ad-
ded their voices to the call for the
resignations of two top adminis-
tration officials at the university.
Yesterday, the officers of the
Faculty Senate began circulating
an open letter calling for the
resignations of university Presi-
dent Father Donald Nesti and
vice president for Academic Af-
fairs Dr. Rolando Bonachea. This
letter was given to Nesti,
_ faculty
members. -

A forum, sponsored jointly by
Father Nesti and the SGA, at-
tempted last night to establish a
dialogue about the controversy
concerning the university's folk
dance troupe, the Tamburitzans,
and other matters of student
concern.

The open letter, which is ad-
dressed specifically to Nesti,
states, in part, ’’In the name of all

In a prepared statement yester-

day, Nesti said neither he nor -
Bonachea have any intention of

resigning.

”They [the faculty members] 
make these drastic demands S

background on thesituation, nor‘ F ,
have they offered any positive 50- ’

Rehabilitationcenter under fire on fraud charge

GREENSBURG, Pa. —— The
state Attorney General’s office
has filed suit to stop a West-
moreland County organization
from soliciting money for ball-
point pens assembled by its
retarded and handicapped
clients‘.

The county, meanwhile, has

given Rehabilitation Center and
Workshop Inc. of Greensburg no-
tice that it is cancelling the
center's contract and transferring
the 180 clients to other organi-
zations.
, The suit, filed Monday in Com-
monwealth Court, claims that the
center, run by Eugene F. Gress—
ley, violated state law by not
registering the commerce as a
Charity.

More than 35 percent of dona-
tions to the agency are used to
cover fund—raising costs —
another violation of state regula-
tions according to Deputy Attor-
ney General Mollie A. McCurdy.

The center's primary fuction is
raising money, not rehabilitating

its retarded and handicapped
clients, she said. In unsolicited
mailings, the center asked for $2
for each pen.

’’I’m surprised at this,” Gress—
ley said. ’’I was subpoenaed a
year ago by the attorney general,
and we discussed the letter which
is sent to Pennsylvania residents,
and they said the case was dis-
missed.”

A state audit earlier this year
said that in the 1982-83 fiscal
year Gressley allocated $251,022
for consulting and marketing
companies he operates, and that
Westmoreland County overpaid
the agency by $126,666.

The currency fraud cause could
cost the Wo|fsb,urg—based com pa-
ny up to 480 million marks, equal
to $263 million. It has provoked
a shakeup of VW’s management.

Burkhard Junger, the former
Volkswagen trader, was the first
person to be arrested in the cur-
rency fraud case that stunned
West Germany's financial and
corporate establishment.

Carl Retemeyer, spokesman for
the Braunschweig district prose-
cutor which is probing the Volk-
swagen fraud case, said Junger
was arrested Sunday to prevent
him from fleeing West Germany.

Task force seeks to

clean up child Ia ws
HARRISBURG — A task force
on Tuesday called for changes to
correct what Attorney General
LeRoy Zimmerman says, is state

law's ”shameful failure to ade-
quately protect Pennsylvania's
children from kidnapping, assault
and sexual abuse.”
Zimmerman said the task force
exposed Pennsylvania as a state
where trying to kill a child isn't
considered abuse, luring children
into cars isn't a crime and pos-

sessing child pornography is,

legal.

”This is a state whose child-
abuse laws are the least protec-
tive in the nation, a state whose
laws tell the world, ’Pennsylvania
doesn't care about child abuse
unless and until the abuse results
in serious injury or death,’ ” Zim-
merman said in a statement.

”This shameful failure to pro-
tect our children cries out for cor-
rection,” he said. ”The task force
has provided us with a blueprint
for reform.”

with a slashed throat Tuesday in
the back of his store, city officials
said.

The victim, who was pro-
nounced dead at the scene, was
identified as Dean George of
suburban Harrisburg. He was
described as being in his late 50s
or early 605, according to Harris-
burg Mayor Stephen Reed.

Reed said the body was found
face up on the floor in a
storeroom and that George's
throat had been slashed.

As of early afternoon, police
had not moved the body and had
not listed a specific cause of
death.

There was no evidence of a
robbery, although police
wouldn't rule it out.

Reed said a number of people
were being questioned, but they
weren't considered suspects.

Parents of children with
 AIDS virus express fears

By Jeff Barker

Associated Press Writer

PHILADELPHIA — A mother of '

a 4-year-old boy with acquired

--\immune deficiency syndrome

Inn-

\{

said Tuesday she won't tell her
son he has the fatal disease be-
cause if he told a schoolmate, it
”could ruin his life.”

”I can't risk having him be a
leper,” she said.

The woman, using a fictitious
name, spoke in an interview be-
fore participating in a closed
workshop on AIDS in children.
Her son contracted the disease,

“:she said, through a blood trans-

fusion shortly after birth.

Surgeon General C. Everett
Koop invited the woman and the
mother of a child who died of
AIDS in 1983 to a three-day con-
ference of physicians, social
scientists and government health
care experts.

People don't seem to believe
scientists’ claims that the disease

-*cannot be transmitted through

casual contact, she noted.
”People are terrified,” she said.
”In science, things are never con-

clusive or final, so people aren't
sure.”

Earlier, at Los Angeles theatrical
manager told the conference of
the struggles faced by her family
after her 3-year-old son died of
AIDS in 1983. He, too, had
received contaminated blood
shortly after birth.

Helen Kushnick said a mortu-
ary refused to dress her son's
body for burial, and her healthy
daughter was barred from a nurs-
ery school for fear she would
contaminate the other children.

”How do we address our fears?
Do we take it to the point of
cruelty with children?” she said.

Kushnick blamed the govern-
ment for ”apathy” on AIDS
research, blaming the slowness
on the initial misperception that
it was ”a homosexual disease.”

”To me, we were killing in the
name of morality,” she said.

At -the close of the conference
Wednesday, the 150 participants
are to make recommendations to
Koop on strategies for coping
with the growing number of chil-

' dren with AIDS.

Nearly two—thirds of pediatric

AIDS cases are the result of trans-
mission from infected mother to
child. Transfusion—related cases
are expected to drop because of
tests that screen the nation's
blood supply.

The number of children under
13 with the disease is expected
to swell to 3,000 by 1991, ac-
cording to the Public Health Serv-
ice. Of the 471 reported cases
now, more than half are black
and 25 percent are Hispanic.

Two scientists told the con-
ferees Tuesday that the public
should not expect an AIDS vac-
cine soon.

”Right now, a vaccine is not
going to be part of our immedi-
ate strategy,” said Walter Dow-
dle of the federal Centers for
Disease Control.

Even if a vaccine were used be-
fore the year 2000, it might not
completely eradicate the
problem, said Gerald Quinnan of
the Food and Drug Adminis-
tration.

”If the vaccine is 80 percent ef-
fective and it's given to 80 per-
cent of the population, you'll

Student phone list
could be completed
by middle of term

By Randy Reading

For The Pitt News

A phone directory for all un-
dergraduate, non-CGS Pitt stu-
dents that live on and off
campus may be available as
early as next fall ifdata collec-
tion can bestreamlined, ac-
cording to Vince Altomare, an
SOB member who has been
organizing this effort since last
year

The idea calls for the distri-
bution of cards to students dur-
ing registration via advisers
during registration by distribut-
ing them at Thackeray Hall,
where the cards can be turned

‘in.

The information received
will allow the SGB to print the
phone numbers of students
who live off campus with
compliance of the Buckley
Amendment which requires

”positive approval” of all
those living on and off
campus.

”The [adviser’s] involve-
ment with this idea will be
crucial for its success, and any
cooperation will be greatly ap-
preciated,” said Altomare.

Phone numbers of those in
the freshman class will be ad-
ded. during their orientation
program using the same for-
mat, so the final compilation
of information in a printed ver-
sion can be expected in mid-
October. '

If the project can be com-
pleted, Altomare and others
are considering the possibility
of listing of the phone num-
bers in related groupings for
the different schools and frater-
nities. If successful, this will be
the first such publication in the
last 10 years.

There is hope for
the football team

-It has been an exciting year for the university. Bicentennial
events have sparked a year and helped make it a positive.
Perhaps one of the most positive aspects of the year is what
none of us have had to hear since the days of Foge Fazio.

When Mike Gottfried took over the Pitt football program in
the late fall of 1985, he faced two major problems:

0 He was taking over a losing program.
0 He was inheriting a group of players who lacked dis-
cipline — especially off the field. -

During the off-season, it seemed as if- some players spent more
time in front of a magistrate than they did in the weight room.

The problems surrounding Craig Heyward, as well as other
players, have been well documented. Now, it seems Heyward
has turned over a new leaf.

_And as this school year comes to an end, we have not been
exposed to any incidents involving members of the football
team. Congratuations to Gottfried for earning the respect of his
players and instilling a sense of responsibility in them.

He set the tone as soon as he took over the program. Several
players, including Dexter Hairston, Dwayne Milloy, Jim Zde-
lar, Brian Davis, Andy Lewis and Tony Williams, were either
suspended or dismissed from the team. He has told the play-
ers that if they act like men, they'll be treated like men. And
ifthey act like kids, they'll be treated like kids. It's pretty basic,

but'it has worked.
Good work.

The problems left behind by the Foge Fazio era were big ones,
but Gottfried has made substantial headway. '

In the end, the football program looks better, the players look
better and, most importantly, the university looks better.

Changing our industries

Defense analysts will now, by
hook and by crook, research
product reform. The reformation—
transformation of the military-
industrial complex and all other

related heavy—meta|, assembly

line research industries,_etc., is
ensuing. Specialists in every field
are required —— people with time
to volunteer in their field or who
are in search of research grants.
We will need’ historians with an
eye for particulars. For l fear  I
fear greatly that our history is be-
ing whitewashed away, like the
Russians have washed away their
history by starving their people
for knowledge and denying them
se|f—discipline.

This transformation of destiny
will rehabilitate government and
industry from theiraddiction to
the useless and |ife—threatening
industries, such as these: Bomb-

-Making (BM) — goodbye, Star

Wars, gun-running (GR) — sorry,
Iran and Geopolitical Revolution
Gaming (GRG). Instead, we will

of appropriate technologies,
housing, communications net-
works, courts, schools and other
similarly evil and despicable free-
lunch-philosophy ‘items. '
Hence, this era will be known
for all time as the "Deconstruc—
tion.” Like the Reformation, the
Renaissance and the Enlighten-
ment, the Deconstruction is one
of those monumental ages of man
whereby all the popular values
take a qualitative shift in the sin-
cerest hopes of improvement.
Not one to take promises lightly,
having done the dirty laundry of
Pittsburgh in this, the blood-
drenched',20th century, it seems
likely that the Deconstruction
could well be another will of the
wisp. Still, there should be no
whispers about its intent. The
Deconstruction involves the dis-

mantling and reconstruction of all

products ensnared in the govern-
ment’s tax-and—tax—and—spend—
and-spend portfolio of weapons
systems. The purpose of such dis-
mantling is to manage the re-
allocation of said expenditures to
more usable products. Hence,

the political platform of this anti-

warmongering is product reform.

Potheads getting the government out of debt

In response to James Crary’s ar-
ticle onllegalizing pot, I can only

. say one thing — keep up the

good work! This is an issue that
is considered taboo in our day —
why? A hell of a lot of college stu-
dents smoke pot; why not deal
with it instead of ignoring it? In

' the '60s and '70s, people were

flaunting their doobies around
proudly, and people looked the
other way. Now if you mention
"grass," those same "hippies"

 look away also. Why?
' ‘ Because in a way we're condi-
tioned to do so. Is dope that bad? '

If so, why haven't they told us the
"facts? I've personally never seen
any statistics relating to all of the
deaths and cancer cases that in-

 volve pot. Have you? All I've

seen is bullshit that says it may be
harmful. But let's be rational; if

controlled and used wisely, pot

is probably a lot less harmful than
alcohol (our biggest problem) —

and [alcohol] is legal? Not to

Misinformation mountain;

The Pitt News has very little
credibility when it comes to
reporting developments concern-
ing the Black Action Society. On
April 3, you declared in banner
headlines, "BAS resolves to hold
re-election despite conflicts." The

article that followed had no offi-

cial confirmation from the BAS,
nor were any Steering Committee
members quoted in an official ca-
pacity.

Whoever feeds The Pitt_News .

 

LETTERS

these mountains of misinforma-
tion really plays your paper and
its readers for suckers. Moreover,
you give your readers little credit
if you think that people should
not be more critical of your paper
than of the BAS; .

Anytime a paper comes out
with bold headlines and articles,
without so much as the name of
a single BAS Steering Committee
member, this is the earmark of ir-
responsible journalism.

indeed, you have the nerve to
quote people who are afraid to be
named; this is called yellowjour-
nalism.

On the night of the election
hearings, the Elections Commit-
tee made a recommendation for
a ‘re-election, which must be ap-

proved by the Steering Commit- ’

tee. But because of the brevity of

time, it is not likely nor feasible
tohold re-elections this semester.

Other decisions were made by
the Elections Committee con-
cerning the complaints that were
heard; the hearing itself was open
to the public, yet The Pitt News
did its readers another disservice
by not attempting to obtain the
facts in an above-board fashion.

Let this be stated once and for
all, if only for your readers’ infor-
mation: Any claims made about
BAS intentions are not complete-
ly accurate and definitely not offi-
cial unless a BAS spokesperson is
identified. ‘S

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, April 8, I987

Virginity is a lost cause

There are high school girls in
Michigan who think they can't
get pregnant if they wear high
heels during intercourse. Some
teen—agers believe they can't get
pregnant if they don't kiss during
intercourse.

About 11 percent of all teen-
age girls in the country were
pregnant in 1983. That's 11 out
of every 100 teen—age girls.

Such statistics dramatically il-
lustrate the need for sex educa-
tion in high schools, yet such
programs are being met with in-
tense and violent opposition in

_ the communities.

Seventy—six schools around the
country have established clinics
which make contraceptives avail-
able to the students. These clin-
ics offer education about sex and
contraception as well as counsel-
ing for the students.

Many parents and educators —
even Secretary of Education Wil-
liam Bennett — believe that
teaching teenagers about con-
traception will encourage teen-
agers to become sexually active.
It's obvious that teen—agers are
sexually active, and sex without
contraception obviously leads to
pregnancy. Thus opposing edu-
cation about contraceptives
amounts to,_ in effect, advocating
teen-age pregnancy.

Ignorance, in the case of con-
traception, is not bliss. Yet those
who oppose education about
birth control are advocating ig-
norance‘. Imagine, the secretary
of education of the United States,

  

 

     

  L TERESA
CANDORI

advocating ignorance.

The first school clinic which
made contraceptives available to
students cut the pregnancy rate in
half, but there is no evidence to
support the claim that sex educa-
tion causes an increase inthe sex-
ual activity of teen—agers.

‘ It's interesting that, throughout
high school, we are taught in his-
tory classes about wars and what
causes them, yet no one has ever
protested history classes with the
claim that students who are
taught about wars are more like-
ly to run right out and start a war.

Parents cannot prevent their
children from having_sexual inter-
course. They can advise, they can
educate, they can even rant and
rave, but the fact remains that
there is no way for even the most
conscientious parents to prevent
sex among teens. One hopes that
parents wouldpass on to their
children some standard of moral-

 

ity, but when the decision to
leave virginity behind actually
arises, it is highly doubtful that
mom and dad are there to make
the decision for their child.

Characters on televison shows
had sex 20,000 times last year.
Parents cannot hope to shelter
their children from ‘the notion of
sexuality. They can only give
their children some sort of frame-
work within which to perceive
sexuality. And if parents can't or
won't teach their children about
contraception, the schools must.

According to a Harris poll, only
one third of sexually active teen-
agers in the United States use
contraception regularly. The rest
said they use birth control
”sometimes.” _

Half of America's 13 to 17 year

olds are sexually active. Most of .

them neglect to protect them-
selves against pregnancy. Many
of them don't even have a clear
understanding of how a woman
becomes pregnant, but ignorance
doesn't keep_ them chaste.

If a parent is responsible about
educating his or her children
about sex and has made his or
her position on the matter of pre-
marital sex and contraception
clear, why is the thought of aca-
demic instruction about sex and
contraception so terrifying? Chil-
dren are going to find out about
sex one way or another —
shouldn't the information they
receive be accurate?

Teresa,Candori is a news edi-
tor for The Pitt News.

Ofcourse you're not sexist I

Sexist.

The mere mention of the word
can make a grown man cringe.
”Who me? Why there isn't a sex-
ist bone in my body,” he whines
pitifully in an attempt to deny the
charge.

Denial does not raise his value
in the eyes of a woman who
knows better. '”Yes, you,” she
sighs for the millionth time. She
shouldn't have to tell him to treat
her like a human being.

You out there with the amused
smirk on your face, wipe it off,
You say you don't see anything
wrong with the way women are
treated. Society is fair  enough.

But fair enough for whom?

That's right. Men.

”Equality” is a loaded term —
a contradiction, if you will. I'm
not talking about the right to-
share the same public bathroom.
True equality is much more than
that. I'm talking about being treat-
ed like a person. Not a man, not
a woman, a human being.
Don't tell me that I'm imagin-
ing that men and women are
treated differently. They are.
Sure, there are fundamental
differences between men and
women. I'm well aware of that.
But where does it say that these
differences are irreconcilable?
Perhaps you are confusing the
woman of the '80s, who de-
mands that her equality be recog-
nized, with the radical bra-burner
of the early '70s. Today's wom-
O .
an does not demand the right to

does demand the recognition of
her person, independent of her
sex. '

Wait a minute, these are the
'80s. Women can be doctors,
 anything.
Surely. a woman is no longer
judged by‘ her sex?

”NeverI” ”Of course not.”
ask any
”healthy, red-blooded” male,
and he'll tell you: ”She’s just
another ditzy chick looking for an
excuse to justify things that didn't
go her way.” Any excuse will do,
as long as it puts the blame on
someone else, right? i

I'm not looking for,excuses. I
simply think I deserve the chance
to prove myself in my field  the
same chance that any man has.

The other night, a friend and I
were talking about preconceived
notions men have about women.
While said in jest, I was ”remind-
ed” that a woman should be a
homemaker. , It's his duty to
”bring home the bacon.”

A womannot only has to prove '

her worth in her chosen field, she
must also prove it in any number
of other areas.

Although it's strictly a matter of
taste, the one injustice that burns
me the most occurs when men
assume that because I'm a wom-
an, I am incapable of discussing
sports intelligently.

If I were a photographer instead
of a reporter, I would have quite
a few pictures of the dumb looks
people give me when they dis-
cover, not only am I a (gasp)
reporter, I'm also (choke) not ath-

’ letically uneducated.

Horrors!

Even better than being a pho-
tographer, if I had a nickle for ev-
ery person I have shocked with
the knowledge that I like sports,

-I wouldn_’t be writing this

column.

Another thing that can be an-
noying is how some men refer to
women. Knicknames are an en-

‘tirely different matter. They're not

derogatory. But to constantly be
referred to, to your face, as
”Toots” or ”Sweets” by men you
don't even know (not to mention
what they call you behind your
back) can really rub a woman the
wrong way. I have a name,
thanks  use it.

Think about it guys, how
would you like it if a group of
women stood on the corner and
whistled after you? What if wom-
en thought you were only good
for one thing?

Many women think that.

newspaper story about the
craziness that had started in

The story talked about all

spring break who had
migrated to Daytona Beach
to get wild, drunk and row-
dy. MTV was supposed to
be en route to Daytona
Beach, to telecast the revel-

 

apparently become what '
Fort Lauderdale used to be.  

As I say, I was reading a
newspaper story about this. The place where I was reading the
newspaper story was Longboat Key, Fla.

Longboat Key is about as far in tone and atmosphere from
Daytona Beach as you can get. Longboat Key is quiet, serene,
placid and sleepy. If Daytona Beach is a midnight orgy, Long-
boat Key is an afternoon nap.

You get to Longboat Key by flying to Sarasota, on the west
coast of Florida. There-is only one street on Longboat Key —
Gulf of Mexico Drive. Gulf of Mexico Drive has only one traffic
light.

The reason I'm bringing this up is that I talked to four people
of my college generation recently, and they all had just returned
from vacations on Longboat Key. The '60s students who used

to go beserk in Fort Lauderdale are now idling peacefully —

with their families —— on Longboat Key.

The interesting thing about this phenomenon is that Longboat
Key traditionally has been a haven for older, retired persons.
And it still is— those are the men and women who make up
the majority of Longboat Key's population. But it seems that
the generation now turning 40 has decided thatlit would much
rather rub shoulders with people in their 60s, 70s and 805 than
mingle with the young crowds at Daytona and Fort Lauderdale.

I figured that as long as I was staying on Longboat Key, I might

as well get the lowdown from the man who knows the most .

about it. So I spoke with John Drummey, executive director of
the Longboat Key Chamber of Commerce. ’

”Yes, we're 180 degrees in the opposite direction from I=sor,t,_l..'..-‘, ‘

Lauderdale and Daytona Beach,” Drummey’ said. ”The peo-
ple on Longboat Key are vastly more conservative. I would
describe Longboat Key as quiet, reserved and Iow—key. The aver-

ageage on Longboat Key is about 65.”

I asked him what changes he had noticed on Longboat Key

in recent years.

”Have you ever heard of the term ’yuppie’?” Drummey asked.

I said that yes, I had.

”Well, for some reason, the yuppies have decided that they
want to be here with the older people,” he said. ”The two
groups interact very well. Everyone here wants to enjoy the good
life — the good quiet life.”

I said that at 11 p.m. in places like Daytona Beach and Fort '
Lauderdale, the raucous street parties were just getting started. '

”On Longboat Key, it's like a graveyard at 11 p.m.,” Drum-
mey said. ”And we like it that way. We wouldn't have it any
other way.”

I asked him if he had any theories about why the baby boom
generation was now joining its parents to. vacation on Long-
boat Key.

”A person reaches a period in life where he's no longer a '

bouncy college kid who wants to let off steam,” Drummey said.

”That person is duly engaged during the year making a buck. I

And when he wants to relax, he wants to relax in a place where.
it's quiet. He's gotten that other stuff out of his system.”
Drummey, who is 65 himself, said, ”I can rememeber when

I was 18, 19, 20, in college. I couldn't drink itfast enough. There»-

weren’t enough women to satisfy me. Those are goodmemories

Later that evening, ‘I took a stroll on the beach next to the

Gulf of Mexico. There wasn't a soul around. I walked untiI.I 

got tired, and then I headed back to the place I was staying.
It was about 9 p.m. . , «

When I got there, I noticed 10 or 12 college kids hanging
around talking. They were some of the very few college kids
I had seen on Longboat Key. They were carrying six-packs of
beer; apparently they planned on sitting out in the moonlight
and drinking. ‘ °

I unlocked my "door and looked at them.

My only thought was: '

Looking for edibles in the Towers cafeteria

Although we've spent nine col-
lective wonderful years here at
Pitt, there are two things that will
be missed least. The first being
the dorm’s fraction-of—a—ply toilet
paper that serves its purpose but,
being just shy of 220—grit sand-

paper, is far from our idea of ’

comfort.

Then there is the cafeteria. I, a
student for four painful years, will
take you on a guided tour of our
illustrious cafeteria. I must say
that I do have some respect for
the cafeteria staff, and I can un-
derstand that it is no picnic try-

ing to prepare and serve food

-(and I use that term loosely) to
thousands of obnoxious, belliger-
ent students every day.

However, I still have my gripes.
The hot food wouldn't be all that
bad if you didn't have to chip the
ice from it for 15 minutes before
you can eat it. The World War II
surplus dinner rolls remind me of
giant, mutant croutons. Did you
ever notice that there are no
pigeons in Schenely Park on the
days that we have ”chicken”? 
Makes you wonder.

Sometimes you have to search
both cafeterias for even a single
ice cube, or you can always pick
some up off the floor. While wait-
ing for new ice cubes to freeze,
you can go to a nearby beverage
thruster to get your shirt saturat-
ed by a sputtering torrent of over-
carbonated refreshment. Thank-

fully, this type of reaction from a
dispenser is the exception, and
the next one over will serve you
normally by secreting a dark-
brown sample of high viscosity
tar, not to be remotely mistaken
for Coke.

Angry and sopping, you find a
place to sit in a dark corner un-
der an air-conditioning duct next
to some diseased plant. By this
time, you're ready to eat, and you
look down at your tray expecting
to see golden rivers of butter

streaming down over your
steamy vegetables. Well, the but-
ter is as hard as a brick and colder
than it was before you got it, but
at least you now know where you
can put the butter to keep it from
melting. Perhaps the veggies
could also be used to chill the
milk, which is usually kept in the
neighborhood A of room tem-
perature.

Eventually, you decide to give
up hope on this particular fiasco
and attempt to salvage the meal
that was stricken from your ID by
going over to the deli line. ”This
can't fail,” you lie to yourself as
you approach the grumbling
lunchmeat hostess. In a proud,
clear voice, you say, ”I’|l have

roast beef  on rye  with Swiss
cheese.” You panic as you see
her bagged hand pass over your
cheese selection. Think quick!
Get her attention! As you attempt
to jog her memory, you shout,
”Swiss  Swiss!  SWISS!!!” But
it's too late. You've just been

. handed a plate with ham salad on

a bun with muenster.

You pause to think for a mo-
ment, but the sheer magnitude of
her error tells you not to try again,
and the endless list of daily
cafeteria horrors suggests that you
give up and go home.

”The Hole," ”The Pit,” or ”The
Seventh Layer of Hell,” call it
what you wish, I'm sure not go-

ing to miss it.

I gaze at him every day through
the season, and the rest of the
year, I look at his picture on my

gorgeous, and does he know it!

The really serious part of this is
that other guys I know haven’t a
chance with me because I com-
pare them with him. Nobody has

his muscles and rich tan. I know
so much about him, from friends
who knew him in school — what
he likes, things he said when he

would say this was all amusing,
but the fact that you can't ap-

Lambda Chi plans to continueescort service

By Theresa Costello
Staff Writer

The Student Government
Board ‘has recently proposed
offering an escort service for Pitt
students. Meanwhile, a service
that is already being offered
seems to have been overlooked.

This service is offered by Pitt's
chapter of Lambda Chi Alpha
fraternity, which began the escort
service last term both in response
to a series of attacks in the Oak-
land area and on the advice of
one of their national consultants.

Any student in the north and
south Oakland campus area is el-
ligible to use this service, which
runs Sunday through Thursday

from 7:30 p.m. to 12:30 a.m.

The days on which the service
is offered were recently criticized
in a perspective column in The
Pitt News. ’

Todd Underiner, president, of
LCA, said, ’’I had thought l was
very clear about the reasons that
the escort service did not run on
weekends. One was because of
the liability for drunken people.
Also, it is very difficult to sched-
ule brothers for Friday and Satur-
day nights when they'd rather be
out, too.”

Brothers have volunteered to
escort any student, but most re-
questing the service are those
studying on the weekdays and a
few people who use the service

"regularly coming home from
work.

LCA said it was also disturbed
by a recent perspective column
in The Pitt News because it said
that the fraternities ”should stick
to what they do best.”

’’I feel it is stupid and wrong to
criticize our efforts,for an honest
service,” said Underiner.

In the beginning, LCA hoped to
get other fraternities involved but,
as of yet, the only other plan is
the one proposed by the SGB.

LCA does, however, plan on
continuing their service until the
SGB’s taxi service is in operation.

The service was used quite fre-
quently last semester, but the
number has decreased slightly

’Living will’ consensus favorable

By Rod Snyder

Associated Press Writer

HARRISBURG — A Senate
committee approved legislation
Tuesday that would allow people
to write ”living wills” saying they
don't want |ife—sustaining care if
they become terminally ill.

The legislation prompted little
debate before clearing the Senate
Public Health and Welfare Com-
mittee on a 6-3 vote. A similar bill
passed the Senate in the last legis-

lative session but died in the‘

House.
The legislation would allow
people to draft a legal document

detailing what medical treatment
should be administered or with-
held if they become terminally ill.

The legislation also defines and
forbids euthanasia and aided-
suicide.

A controversial section of the
bill specifies that an incurably ill,
pregnant patient be kept alive to
permit a live birth unless it would
be physically harmful and un-
reasonably painful to the patient.

Sen. Roxanne Jones, D-
Philadelphia, said she voted
against the bill because she be-
lieves a woman should be able to
decide what is to be done to her
body.

’’I think it's taking a woman's
constitutional right away from
her,” said Jones.

The Rev. Ronald Sell, director
of the Lutheran_Coalition on Pub-
lic Policy, said the provision was
also a concern of his group.

”We have been in favor of liv-
ing will legislation for some time
[but] we have not been as excit-
ed about this version," Sell said.

”Basically the bill indicates that
if one is pregnant, a living will
won't be recognized,” he added.

Sell also said the group objects
to a provision that requires phy-
sicians to continue providing

this term.
The reason for this, according
to Greg Kuczynski, a LChA

' brother, is that ”there was a lot

of violence last semester, but
things are much calmer now.
Many girls just don't see the need
as much now.”

LCA.admits that ithas not been
doing as much advertising this
term as it did last term, but its ex-

ecutive board plans on advertis-
ing more before finals, when the
need for an escort service is much
greater.

Also, because of the warmer
weather and the return of the
teen-age gangs in the Oakland
area, LCA anticipates more calls.

To request the service, a stu-
dent should call 687-2369 or
683-2575.

THE Pl|Tl' NEWS, Wednesday, April 3,1937

It's not a movie, but it'll make a good book

Six editors sat on or near the two

' lounge chairs in The Pitt News well

after midnight on what I think was a
Wednesday. What was happening was
a combination of The Big Chill and
The Breakfast Club ramming headlong
into an episode of Lou Grant.

’ Empty styrofoam cups and creamer
containers were scattered around a
coffee pot that_sat on the table
separating Kathy, Joe, Chris and John
from Tess and me. The coffee was

, poured during a discussion that Tess

had_innocently enough begun as she

worked on a story for a magazine

writing class. -

It had run from how and why we
had arrived and stayed at this
newspaper, our likes and dislikes of *
each other straight through religion
and the threat of nuclear war. When
it was over several hours later, we left
together and strayed apart on the way
to separate apartments on and off the
campus.

I suppose it happens everywhere.

People work together and become
closer through the work they do every
day -- or in this case every other day.

. It is something our parents don't quite

understand, and perhaps we don't un-
derstand it fully ourselves. What hap—

' pens to us that makes us want to stay

at the paper far past the time we are

I

LOOKING

DIRK KAUFMAN

req‘uired.?‘Why does each of us inex-

plicably find ourselves drifting toward
the newsroom at any time of the day-
or night?

I have often found myself here for
no reason at all — sometimes waiting
and hoping someone else would
come in as, invariably, they do. We
come here often for no good reason
other than to simply be here.

A lot of people would scoff at the
cliques that form. Some of our own,
people see it as a bad thing for the
paper — in past years it has been
detrimental to the quality you see.

This year, for some reason, the
clique has returned, but it has been a
large one —— with certain characters
fading in and out — always open for

' new members.

It wasn't planned that way, you
know. The best things that happen in
any organization rarely are. But what
it has done for us — and for our read-
ers —— has made the paper a better
publication. '

And it is ‘a better paper than the
campus has seen in quite a while. It
sounds funny to hear it coming from a
member of the staff here, but the fact
is that we can see the stupidity and
the quality in our own work, too.’

The mistakes still sneak through as
the flats that will be processed into a
newspaper are placed into the box for
delivery to Typecraft Press. If we tried
to catch them all, the thing would
never get to you.

When it does come out, we pick it
up the same way you do —— just to ,
see how it looks. If one of us spies a
person reading the paper, we stop
and watch the eyes of the reader. We
strain to see what's being read and
wait for a smile in reaction to a
column or watch for the looks of curi-
ousity and intrigue at- the writing or
pictures.

Kathy came up with the name for
this column, by the way. It's pretty
simple, and sometimes it even works
out that way. I knew I wanted to do
something like what i wound up do-
ing with it, but the name solidified
the idea.

As with just about anything you'll
see in the paper, this is not one, sin-
gle person’s idea. .

If the pay were better and this silly
business about attending classes
weren't in the way, I know a lot of us

RECYCLE

wouldn't mind staying here for as
long as we still cared about each
other. It's almost an unfortunate thing
that several of us are headed out into
the world beyond minimum wage —
at least for us, if not for you.

Perhaps in the future, we will all
come together again. If we do, it will
make for a great conclusion to one
heck of a good movie. If not, we had
a lot of fun with a little bit'of sadness
and other crap mixed in — and the
campus got a newspaper out of the
deal. .

Bicentennial efforts raise awareness of past

By Anthony Wroten
For The Pitt News

Pitt's bicentennial has prompt-
ed the examination of various
related issues, including student
apathy, philanthropy and fund
raising, the quality of academics
and instruction and the role of
students in the celebration. But

the bicentennial is primarily a _

public relations event, and the
largest after effect of the celebra-
tion will have been public aware-
ness of the university.

' According to Tim Ziaukus,
spokesman for the bicentennial
commission, ”The bicentennial
represents a formal link between
the past and the future.” The Bi-
centennial offically began with
this year's Homecoming Week
and will continue until com-
mencement ceremonies to be

held on May 10.

The scheduled events were
geared to raising the conscious-
ness of the entire Pitt communi-
ty about the heritage that began
during the time of the Revolution-
ary War. According to Ziaukus,
events were planned to include
the students, faculty and the
alumni. Homecoming, including
the parade, pep rally, football
game and dance, prompted the
students’ involvement.

The word ”bicentennia|” was
applied to many annual events
such as the jazz festival, Writers’
Conference, and Founder's Day,
which took place on Feb. 28.

”The bicentennial has a great
promotional value because it
gives us a legitimate and genuine
occasion to tell the Pitt story,” Zi-
aukus said. ”Within this business,
functioning as an university, we

need to display our image. We
have to raise awareness and
spirits for our survival. An insti-
tution with such history should
be willing to present its
achievements.”

Ziakus said of the public rela-
tions aspect, ’’I am the product of
the client that I'm selling. This is
both professionally. gratifying as
well as being fun. Public relations
tells the client's story in the cor-
rect light. The bicentennial is a
news hook, one that we can hang
all kinds of stories on.”

Ziaukus cited a few of the
major breakthroughs that Pitt has
contributed to- society. It was
proven here that the rings of
Saturn are made up of various
elements as opposed to the the-
ory of them being solid matter. Jo-
nas Salk developed the polio
vaccine here. Most of the major

advances in transplant surgery
were made at Pitt's hospitals.

Ziaukus also pointed out that
Pitt is a member of the Associa-
tion of American Universities,
which represents the top 57
research institutions.

”There is a lot to celebrate in
200 years,” Ziaukus said. ”We’ve
endured, and we all need to work
together to keep up the excel-
lence and further growth and
achievements.”

Ziaukus challenged the notion
that the bicentennial is primarily
a fund—raising event. In actuality
he said, just the opposite has oc-
curred. No additional fund-
raising efforts were completed
but contribution is up 40 percent
this year. ’ ‘

”The money is one residual ef-
fect of the bicentennial," Ziaukus
said.

Families are referred to the
house by local hospital social
workers, primarily from Chil-
dren’s Hospital, who help or-
ganize details such as room
arrangements and financial help
if needed.

The house keeps seven rooms
reserved for families of transplant
patients at all times. The remain-
ing rooms are filled on a first-
come first-serve basis, with priori-
ty given to the families of cancer
patients.

”Things around here are al-
ways at the extremes — every-
body here is either a success or
they don't make it,” said

WHEN IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VlS|T W

Jannenga.

The atmosphere provided by
the Ronald McDonald House
strives to alleviate some of the
stress encountered during the
most traumatic times.

’’It really helps to have people
around you that are going
through the same things that
you're going through/’~Jan’nenga

added. ”Everybody pulls together .

and, if more than one of the kids
doesn't make it in any short peri-
od of time, youcan feel it. The
mood really reflects it.”

A non-profit organization, Chil-
dren’s Oncology Services of Pitts-
burgh, Inc., has owned and
operated the Ronald McDonald
House for eight years.

Television advertising, for
which free airing was given, and
ads in conjuction with the Came-
ron Coca—Cola Company,
prompted companies to ap-
proach Pitt about merchandising,

-particularly T-shirts and sweat-

shirts.

”There is no cost to make pub-
lic friends with the bicentennial,”
Ziaukus said. ”Pioneering the fu-
ture is the motto that is given to
the event. Positioning the univer-
sity for the third century is a mile-
stone. Not many universities can
make that claim, and the bicen-
tennial gives a chance to show
people all the great things here at
Pitt.”

State—school tuition increases
puts clamp on college hopefuls

By Bill Tyson
Associated Press
HARRISBURG — Rising tuition
costs at Pennsylvania's 14 state-
owned universities could put
higher education out of many stu-
dents’ reach, a student advocacy
organization said Monday.
Ann Pavkovic, president of the
. lobbying group Commonwealth
Association of Students, said at a
Capitol press conference that the

state needs to increase funding in.

order to avoid a tuition increase
and maintain quality programs.
The‘, State System of Higher

Education, which oversees the
state—owned schools, told the
Senate and House Appropriations
Committees last month that tui-
tion could rise as much as $175
next year if the state did not pro-
vide more funds.

The state system requested a
10.45 percent increase over last
year's $279.4 million appropria-
tion. Gov. Robert P. Casey has
recommended only a 5 percent
increase.

”If a $175 tuition increase is
realized this fall, public educa-
tion will no longer be public,”

University of Pittsburgh  

Pavkovic said. ”It will no longer

be accessible.”

Pavkovic said if the Legislature
does not increase funding, the
only alternative to a tuition hike
would be lowering the quality of
programs.

”Year after year, we are strug-
gling to maintain our existing pro-
grams at their current levels and
each year we face another tuition
increase,” Pavkovic said.

Tuition at the ‘state—owned
universities, which is now
$1,680, has risen each of the last
three years.

STUDENT PROGRAMMERS WANTED

By Frances Sansig
Contributing Editor

This is one group of exhibi-
-tionists nobody’s going to have to
call the cops on.

Art Ink., a Pittsburgh-based
group of artists, offers those with
a discriminating palate (or
palette, ifyou will) their very first
exhibit — ”Art After Midnight.”

How do you get your first
exhibit?

”You bust your ass,” said Jim
Forrester, who started the six-
member organization last August.

According to Forrester, the
group is currently trying to obtain
a gallery in Butler. Then he hopes
things will begin to accelerate.

7’First, you get your gallery.
Then you get the time, then you
get the shows ...” he said.

Of course, the ultimate goal of
the group is to display its work to
the public. However, the group
also provides a forum for discus-
sion and criticism of art.

”We have weekly meetings;
we talk about each other’s work,

_ give hints. If one of us does some-

thing the others like, we show

 Area artists offer public first glimpse of work

them how to do it,” said For-
rester. 

All of the members of Art Ink.
are Pitt graduates except Tim
Doyle, who said he just wanted
to get involved.

”Young artists don't get enough
attention. In Pittsburgh, art is al-
ways the same. It never changes.
The Pittsburgh art scene is stag-
nant,” said Doyle.

Some of the members of Art
Ink. have participated in other
shows, and Forrester has done in-
dividual shows, but this is their
first group effort.

The artwork ranges from sur-

realistic to ”spastic,” according to
Forrester, and is apparently a big
hit.

”I can honestly say this is the .

best show I've seen in this
gallery,” said Kristy Smith, a
member of the PPC’s art commit-
tee. ”I’ve never seen a reception
like this before.”

The show will continue from
today until April 17, Mondays
through Fridays from 12 to 8 p.m.
in the William Pitt Union Art

Gallery.

Scholars urgequality leadership

By Laurie Lehosky

Staff Writer

Leadership, trust and responsi-
bility were the main topics at the
Bicentennial Symposium on
Leadership in Public Affairs in
Forbes Quad yesterday.

The Graduate School of Public
and International Affairs and the
University Honors College co-
sponsored this event.

The objective of the symposi-
um was to provide information
for undergraduate and graduate
schools of education which will
help increase the number of
graduates that obtain leadership
positions.

Keynote speaker at the sympo-
sium was’Dean Harlan Cleve-

Ignored prescription warning

0  THE PITT‘ NEWS,‘ Wednesday, ‘April 8,1987

Humphrey Institute of Public Af-
fairs at the University of Minneso-
ta. He provided an overview on
the tasks of public executives and
the need to encourage the ”best
and brightest” young people to
consider careers as public ex-

-ecutives.

‘At this point in history, it may
be more important what we do in
this environment than nature ever
did,” Cleveland said. ”Our ca-
pacity to cope with this macro-
transition depends on people like
you and me. We have a personal
responsibility on the general
outcome.” E

Cleveland said this macro-
transition in our environment and
government will require every-
one to think further ahead than
ever before.

 

”The steepest part in leadership

..._.

is not skills but attitude,”.

Cleveland said.

Panelist Elmer Staas, Chairman
of the Harry S. Truman Scholar-
ship Foundation, discussed
leadership in our country.

’’In this year 1987, we need to
take a harder look at the execu-
tive branches at not just the state
but federal level,” Staas said.
”The way to be successful is to
blame the other branch in inci-
dents such as the federal deficit
and arms control. There is a lack
of efficient relationships between
the branches.

”When you have the question

_ of whether you should do some-

thing, and it was the headline of
the morning newspaper — don't

do it,” Staas said.

poses health threat to elderly 

By Michael Blood

Associated Press Writer

HARRISBURG — Warned they
may be writing possibly danger-
ous prescriptions for the elderly,
less than half the doctors and
physicians who received the no-
tices from the state never

responded, a state official said.

Tuesday. _
Those who are not responding

E and may be ignoring the warn-

ings, concern Thomas M. Sned-

den, director of the state's PACE

program.

”The low response rate means
we're not able to correct the drug
therapies of [PACE] cardholders,”
Snedden said in an interview fol-
lowing the hearing. ”-The letters
are ignored in at least half the
cases.”

Snedden told the committee
the warnings are sent out by the
state through a contracting firm

. when PACE files show that a doc-

tor or physician may be prescrib-
ing too much of a drug or a
potentially dangerous combina-
tion of drugs to a member of the
program. About 5,000 such
warnings are sent out each year,
ariarilyto doctors and phy-

The department is able to

been made in prescriptions
through computer records, he
said. 0

PACE, which is the commonly
used name for the Pharmaceuti-
cal Assistance Contract for the
Elderly program, will provide
about $150 million this fiscal
year to offset the cost of prescrip-
tion drugs for the elderly.

A Washington-based company
has been hired by a computer
firm that operates the PACE pro-

-gram to increase the response

rate from doctors and physicians,
Snedden said.

The company, Health Informa-
tion Design Systems, has ob-
tained a 95 percent response rate
in similar situations, Snedden
said. The company will be paid
$650,000 over a three-year peri-
od for its services, he added.

Snedden said modifications
made in patient drug therapy in

PACE system, he said.

Meanwhile, PACE’s quarterly
report was formally presented to
the Senate Aging and Youth
Committee.

Figures in the report indicate
that the state will possibly have
to increase its annual $100 mil-
lion appropriation to the program
within'two years to keep PACE
claims from exceeding revenues.

Snedden said the program is
currently serving about 436,000
persons and operating with a $90
million surplus. He said,
however, participants in the pro-
gram continue to increase about
6 pecent annually, and the aver-
age cost of claims has increased
13 percent from last year.

The state, through the Pa. Lot-
tery Fund, contributes about

_$100 million annually to PACE.

If operations continue at present
rates, the surplus would be ex-
hausted within two years, Sned-
den said. , .
The state aging department,
which oversees the PACE pro-
gram, has begun to concentrate
on cost-saving measures, includ-
ing urging the use of generic
drugs.

meal plan to students this fall “P

By Sandy Rhodes

For The Pitt News

University of Pittsburgh stu-
dents will have one less meal
plan option for the fall. The SA
meal plan, traditionally five
lunches per week, will not be
offered to on—campus students
during the fall term.

According to Cindy DeMatteo,
administrative specialist‘ in the
Meal Ticket Office, the decision
was made by Housing Office per-
sonnel. Students will be able to
contract for one of four meal
plans. The 19-, 14-,_ 10- an_d
5—meal plans will still" be
available.

According to DeMatteo, ’’The
SA meal plan was initially deve-
loped for commuters. The reason
they dropped the 5A meal plan
from the contract was because
too many students were choosing
smaller meal plans or no meal
plan.

”These students, who choose.

The University of Pittsburgh
Nationality Rooms and the Inter-
cultural Exchange Program are
sponsoring a series of organ con-
certs during the month of April to
celebrate the combination of the
Nationality Rooms’ 60th anniver-
sary and the University of Pitts-
burgh’s bicentennial year.

The hour-long organ presenta-
tions feature folk and classical
pieces of music suggested by the
the Nationality Rooms com-
mitttees. ‘

plan, are being subsidized by the
freshmen and new students who
have to take the 14- or 19-meal-
a-week plans,” said DeMatteo.

Dematteo said the new con-
tract will be used on a trial basis.
However, the 5A plan will be
offered to off campus students
and commuters.‘

”The larger meal plans are a
good deal if you eat the meals.
There is no where you can eat
three meals a day for $5.60, and
this is what the 19-meal plan pro-
vides,” said DeMatteo.

The Meal Ticket Office is hop-
ing that this contract change will
not cause students to not choose
a meal plan.

”The reason all freshmen and
transfer students are required to
choose 14 or 19 meals a week is
because of a contract the univer-

sity has with the food service. To .

keep the cafeteria open for 19
meals a week, they need a certain
percentage of students taking 14
or 19 meals a week. And this is
the easiest way for the university
to get the needed percentage of

Presented in the Commons
Room’ of the Cathedral of Learn-
ing April 5, 12,19 and 26 begin-
ning at 2 p.m., the concerts are
free and open to the public.

The administrative assistant to
the director of the Nationality
Rooms, Eileen Kiley, said that the
turnout was moderate for the first
concert Sunday because of the
poor weather conditions this past
weekend. ”The sound of the or-
gan was tremendous and plenty
loud,” Kiley said.

Not only do the organ concerts
celebrate an anniversary event,
but they recapture a past tradition
at the University of Pittsburgh.

. According to Helen Rush, who
was formerly dean of women,
dean of students, dean of Student

Affairs, and the cice chancellor of _

Student Affairs at the University
of Pittsburgh, ”Pitt students of the
30s, 40s and '50s heard organ

students taking meal plans,
DeMatteo said.

”However, exceptions are
made for new residents and fresh-
men if their schedules conflict
with meal times. Students from
Pitt's branch campuses do not
have to abide by the meal plan
for new residents ifthey lived on-
campus at one of the branches,”
she added,

According to DeMatteo, the
students who are on the 5A plan
rarely make all five lunches a
week. The missed meal factor is
close to 20 or 25 percent every
week. Students using this plan are
technically losing money.

In the future, DeMatteo specu-

lates that the university is going ‘i

to force all on-campus students to
choose a meal plan.

The board prices for fall term
have been established as follows:
$608 for 19 meals, $573 for 14
meals, $501 for 10 meals, $356
for 5 meals. The SA plan, offered

campus students has not been set _

THE PITT News

ATLANTA (AP) — Hank Aaron,
baseball's home run king, said
Tuesday that Dodgers executive
Al Campanis’ observation that
blacks may not have all that it
takes to run a major league team
is an example that the game still
has racial prejudice at its top
levels. ' ‘

Campanis, the Los Angeles vice
president of player personnel,

was asked on ABC—TV’s Nightline.

Monday night why there are no
black field managers and few
blacks in baseball management
positions. —

’’I don't believe it's prejudice,”
Campanis said. "I truly believe
they [blacks] may not have some
of the necessities to be, let's say,
a field manager or perhaps a
general manager. I don't say all
of them, but how many quarter-
backs, how many pitchers do you

have that are black?"

Aaron, now an executive with
the Atlanta Braves, said, ’’I think
Mr. Campanis is fairly intelligent,
but when he makes statements
like that, I think he has his head
buried in the sand. He believes
that blacks are not capable
enough or intelligent enough to
run a baseball team, and his be-
lief is not different than any of the
other owners.

LAS VEGAS, Nev. — Sugar Ray
Leonard was back on top of the
boxing world Tuesday, while
Marvelous Marvin Hagler was
emotionally down.

And JoJo Guerra was in the
middle of a controversy.

fight 118-110 (10-2 in rounds) for

ephone. —
Judge Dave Moretti favored
Leonard 115-113, while Lou Fil-
lippo scored 115-113 for Hagler.
“I told you_ about Vegas,” said
Hagler who had failed’ to win the

middleweight title on a 15—round
draw with Vito Antuofermo here
in 1979. He also narrowly kept
the title on a decision over Rober-
to Duran here in a 1983 match
which a lot of ringsiders didn't

”I’ve been hoping that things
would change for the last 10
years. But I don't see any signs of
hope because you still have peo-
ple like Campanis with his be-
liefs. When you have that, blacks
aren't ever going to get any

Pirates lose opener,
fall to New York, 3-2

By Ben Walker
AP Baseball Writer

NEW YORK —- After five
months filled with fights, argu-

ments and assorted problems, the ’

World Series champion New
York Mets finally did what they
do best.

They played baseball, and they

— won.

Darryl Strawberry started the
1987 season with a bang, hitting
a three-run homer in the first in-
ning, and the Mets went on to
beat the Pittsburgh Pirates 3-2 on
Tuesday in the opener for both
teams.

'’It was a relief to all the guys
to get out and play, especially af-
ter last week,” said Mets Manager
Davey Johnson.

"There’s been a lot of talk
about teams hating us so much.
We wanted to get it on," he said.
'’I think if we can get off to a fast
start, it'll disillusion a lot of
teams.” ‘

Strawberry provided the quick
jump, connecting minutes after
the Mets received their World
Series rings and unfurled their
championship banner. Then Bob
Ojeda scattered 10 hits over
seven innings, and Jesse Orosco
finished, allowing one run in the
ninth but getting out ofa bases-
loaded, one—out threat by retiring
Johnny Ray on a pop-up and Bob-
by Bonilla on a ground ball to
second.

But Strawberry, like many of

- his teammates, said some of his

attention was focused on the

missing Met, Dwight Gooden.

Gooden, scheduled to be the
opening-day pitcher, entered a
New York drug rehabilitation
center last week for treatment for
cocaine use. No mention of
Gooden was made during the
pregame ceremonies, and he is
expected to get his ring when he

"That's what makes this sport
beautiful .  all this controversy,"
Guerra said. . I

''I think after he has time to
review the tape, he'll agree with
the officials that Ray won,” Mike

er welterweight champion, said
of Hagler.

morning news conference, which
was not attended by either
fighters.

was instead replaced by a more  -

business-line demeanor.

”Yeah, it does take a lot out of
you knowing he's not here,” said
Strawberry, Gooden’s closest
friend on the Mets. "He can't
have any visitors, but we know
he's thinking about us, and we're-
thinking about him.”

Strawberry wore Gooden’s uni-
form pants in the game, part of
his effort to dedicate this season
to the star pitcher. '

'’I would've worn his whole
uniform if I could have,"
Strawberry, who said he-is also

Darryl Jr. "Not seeing No. 16 on
the mound was frustrating. It
makes you go out and try as hard

years and a continuation of their
recent domination of Pittsburgh.

The Gloucester County Times

DELRAN, N.J. (AP) — To many,
watching Greg Luzinski conduct
baseball practice at Holy Cross
High School might not seem the
best way to spend a day off from
work. It certainly would not be
considered a separate spectator
sport, such as viewing the way In-

. diana’s Bobby Knight conducts

basketball practice.

Yet there still is something
unique about Luzinski’s presense
at Holy Cross and the way he

_ holds a preseason workout. It is

not vocal dominance that causes
Luzinski’s word to echo off the
gymnasium walls or get lost in
the outfield. Quietly and method-
ically, the players seem to under-
stand what he wants them to
accomplish that day‘— and they
do it. A

The man many called ’’The
Bull’’ when he was with the
Philadelphia Phillies and the
Chicago White Sox stands off to
the side during the practice ses-

sions and makes observations on

all that takes place. He says little,

but when he speaks there is little
doubt that all eyes are on The
Bull. His physical appearance is
really all he needs to command
the attention of -the high school
athletes.

Few high school athletes are

. bigger than Luzinski. His biceps

and forearms are still the same
size as those that gave him home
run strength; the same muscles
that were a constant threat to a
pitcher's earned run average and
may have caused him to receive
a few brush—back pitches.

But Luzinski does not need his
size or his name to get the respect
of his players. Holy Cross’
17—player squad is not in awe of
the former major leaguer; still,
they understand that anything Lu-
zinski says comes from 14 years
of professional experience.

Fundamentals dominate a Lu-
zinski practice. They are not fun,
but they are what wins games.

Thus, Luzinski" instructs pitch-
ers to prepare for a drill that has
them covering first base on
ground balls to the right side of
the infield. The Bull observes

while assistant coach Mike McAl-

side. Catcher Brad Pine then
directs his pitcher to cover first
base.

It is a drill repeated until all
pitchers have completed their

Luzinski studies what takes
place and, when he has seen
enough, only then does he call
for another drill — possibly 10
minutes later. This time it calls for
the pitchers to make a throw to
second base and get the lead run-
ner coming from first.

When Luzinski sees something
he does not particularly like in a
player's fundamentals, he-‘will

tells the pitcher how and why he

Cand iotti '5
secret pitch
discovered

TORONTO (AP) ~ Cleve-
land Indians right-hander Tom
Candiotti has received a rude
reminder ofwhat his life in the
big leagues was like before he
discovered the knuckleball.

The pitch that saved Candi-
otti’s career a year ago refused
to cooperate with him’ Mon-
day. The result was a 7-3 loss
to the Toronto Blue lays in the
regular—season opener for both
teams.

”Last year, people swung
and missed that pitch,” said
Toronto's Lloyd Moseby, who
hit a first-inning homer to start
the scoring. ”That’s why Can-
diotti was successful. Hopeful-

The Blue Jays wouldn't
swing at Candiotti’s knuckle-
ball, which was fluttering as
much as ever but usually
danced out of the strike zone.
That forced Candiotti to turn to
a more conventional pitch, the
curveball.

”They were sitting on it,”
said catcher Chris Bando.
”Candy was getting behind
with the knuckler and had to
throw the breaking ball. He's
got to throw strikes with the
knuckler.”

Candiotti was signed by the
Indians before last season, af-
ter they watched him ex-
perimenting with the
knuckleball in the winter. He
refined the pitch, aided by
teammate Phil N iekro, and be-
came Cleveland's most consis-
tent pitcher last year, throwing
a league-leading 17 complete
games while compiling a
16-12 record.

The Blue Jays, however,
came prepared for the pitch
Monday.

”He was throwing a real
hard knuckleball that was
moving, but we didn't swing
at it,” Moseby said. ”He got
behind 2-0 and had to tr
something else.” ‘

“Usually, the curve is the
pitch that gets me out of trou-
ble,” said Candiotti, who had
pitched a four-hit shutout late
in spring training. ’’I just
couldn't throw the knuc_kler
for strikes, so I think I took a
little off of it just to get it
across. And when I went to the
curve,‘ they jumped on that,
too. I just couldn't get into a
rhythm.”

‘ Manager Pat Corrales wasn't

» about to panic over the poor

start for his club.

”We’ve got 161 games re-
maining,” Corrales said. ’’I
don’t know if we're a better
team than Toronto. We've got

   
   

161 games to prove it.”_

McRae say? he's not so fast off the track

By Chuckie Biancucci
For The Pitt News

Lee McRae completed the
1987 indoor season exactly the
way he started it — as the fastest
human to run for the University

of Pittsburgh, and some say, the

fastest human ever to run.
McRae owns the world indoor
record in the 55-meter dash
(6.00) and holds the American
collegiate record in the 60—meter
dash. He has successfully defend-
ed his NCAA crown, making him
a five—time A|l—American. He has

- big plans for the rest of the year.

McRae’s immediate goals point

the World Championships this
spring and summer. The Nation-
al Sports Festival will be held this
summer in Durham, N.C. Being
a’ native of nearby ‘Pembroke,
N.C., he hopes it will provide the
first opportunity for his mother to
watch him compete. ,

Beyond this year, McRae has
already begun to chart his course
to Seoul, South Korea, for the
1988 Olympics. ”l would like to
come out of there with two gold
medals, one in the 100-meters
and also, one in the
[4><l00-meter relay],” McRae
said.

Success is no stranger to
McRae. He started running in his
sophomore year at Wesproverson
High School in North Carolina.
There he obtained great success
in both track and football. One
season, he rushed for 1,500_yards

. and was the state champion in
the 100—meter dash and was
 —

 

 

runner-up in the 200-meter dash
as a junior.

This success led McRae to Pitt.

But when he arrived at Pitt,
football coaches wanted him to
add 30’ pounds to his 5-9,
l55—pound frame and play run-
ning back. McRae said: ”No way.
And since track went so well, I
said, ’what’s the use?’ ”

McRae’s technique might not
be perfect, but his strength at the
beginning of a race is enough to
provide him withvictories. He is
very strong and quick in response
to the gun. ”lt sounds strange, but
when I get into the blocks, I feel
like an animal," said McRae.

_ ”What better animal to be, but a

Panther.”

Like so many times this past
year, McRae bolted away from
the other runners in the first 20
meters. Once this happens, he's
gone. He practices this daily in
the confines of Fitzgerald Field
House between 3 and 5:30 p.m.

McRae fine tunes his concen-
tration by listening to nickels
drop on the track surface. An-
ticipating the fraction of a second
before the muffled pop of the gun
is the reason behind his quick
starts. ”Because every second
counts, it is mainly a reaction to
the first sound. The majority of

 

Lee McRae usesa nickel in practice to simulate the gun.

runners react to the second
sound, the echo.”

McRae spends three days a
week in the weight room,
strengthening his upper body.
”U.pper body strengthening is
very important to a runner, be-
cause the faster you move your
arms, the faster your legs will
go,” said McRae. For the upcom-

.ing outdoor season, McRae will

Leonard's great ability came back to life

By Thomas Zuck
Staff’ Writer

In what may be the greatest
comeback in boxing history, Su-
gar Ray Leonard defeated Mar-

velous Marvin Hagler Monday

night by split decision in Las Ve-
gas to win the World Boxing

_Council middleweight champi-

onship.

Judge Lou Fillipo scored the
fight 115-113 for Hagler, Jojo
Guerra had it 118-110 Leonard,
and Dave Moretti scored it
115-113 Leonard.

Leonard, fighting for the first
time since 1984, displayed the
boxing ability that made him
pound for pound the best fighter
in the world in the late '70s and
early '80s. Leonard used his hand
speed to counter the powerful
body shots by Hagler. Hagler
repeatedly threw more punches
"in. each round, but he could not
land _c|eanly._

The biggest concern at fight

A ‘time was whether Leonard, a

natural welterweight, could
maintain his hand speed and foot
movement with the added
weight. He did. Leonard was on
his toes for n_ine of the 12 rounds.

The first round started as ex-
pected for Leonard. He was on
his toes circling Hagler and keep-
ing him at the end of a left jab.
Hagler continued stalking
Leonard as a right-handed fight-
er, which was surprising because
Leonard has trouble with
Southpaws.

The next three rounds‘ were
more of the same. Hagler
switched to southpaw but was
still unable to trap Leonard on the
ropes. Hagler tried to work the
body with little success. Leonard
was still circling and firing com-
binations. Leonard scored with
quick flurries and took the first

- four rounds.

Leonard's use of movement
side to side enabled him to make
Hagler lunge. When Hagler
would lunge, he would be off
balance and open to combina-
tions from Leonard. In the first
four rounds, Leonard seemed to
be waiting for Hagler to throw
bombs that he would counter
with a left hook followed by a
straight right to the head.

The fifth was Haglers’ first good
round. He repeatedly hit Leonard
with left hooks and was able to
stun Leonard with a right upper-
cut, and Leonard hung on for the
rest of the round.

In the sixth round, Hagler was
able to trap Leonard against the
ropes but was unable to score ef-
fectively, Each time Leonard was
pinned to the ropes, he was able
to get out with a flurry of punches
that scored. Both fighters were
now flat-footed and were ex-
changing punches along the
ropes. Leonard was able to score
with overhand rights that landed
over Hagler’s defense.

The eighth round had Hagler
still trying to trap Leonard to the
ropes. Leonard started to get his
second wind. The two exchanged

punchesTn the center of the ring.
It was then that Hagler was get-
ting tired. He did not have much
power on his punches, and there
was no sting to his jab. Leonard
was able to score repeatedly to
Hagler’s head.

The ninth round had Leonard
still on his toes and able to move
away from the left hook of Ha-
gler. Leonard seemed to be wait-
ing for Hagler to lower his head
to try to work the body. Hagler
moved in like a bull, and Leonard
hit him with six or seven punches"
to the head as compared to Ha-
gler’s two or three punches to the
body.

The 10th round had Hagler
missing repeatedly with wild

lefts. Hagler had Leonard on the
ropes, and he threw three
punches, but Leonard _ducked
each of them. Hagler was still un-
able to cut off the ring from
Leonard. Leonard’s lateral move-
ment opened the way for flurries
that were the end result of miss-
es by Hagler. Hagler was now try-
ing to work to the head with
uppercuts. Both fighters were get-
ting weary. Leonard continued
the taunting. He used the wind-
mill fake and called Hagler
foreward.

The 11th round started much
the same. Hagler was still unable
to catch Leonard and pin him to
the ropes. The taunting continued
as Leonard stuck his head out as
an invitation for Hagler to come
at him. Hagler now sensed that
he needed a knockout to win.
Leonard with his hands down, let
Hagler throw four straight left
hooks and moved backwards as

the punches went by harmlessly.
Leonard appeared weary, but
then he unleashed five punches
to the head of Hagler.

Between rounds, Leonard had
his arms raised in triumph, as the
crowd went into a frenzy.

Hagler, needing the knockout
to win, continued lunging and
missing‘ "in the 12th round.
Leonard, still on his toes as the
round progressed, threw a
10—punch flurry in the middle of

the round to the head and body. ‘
A Leonard continued taunting, he

stuck his head out then shuffled
his feet. Leonard stood flat-footed
and took Hagler’s best shots with
no effect. The fight ended as.it
started -— with Leonard firing
combinations to the head with
amazing speed.

What is for sure is that with this
comeback, Sugar Ray Leonard
has attained immortality in the
boxing world.

By Beth Froelich

Staff Writer

With a win against CMU on

Monday, the Pitt men's tennis
team added to their mid—season
winning streak.

The Pitt Panthers are now 8-7
for the season. After a loss against
top-ranked University of Pennsyl-
vania, Pitt came back to win their
next six matches.

The match against CMU was
not the toughest the Panthers will
play this season but was a confi-
dence builder for the team, as
they rolled over the Tartans 8-1.

In No. 1 singles play, Pitt
sophomore Neil Meyerowich
defeated CMU’s Keith Grumet in
two straight sets 7-6, 6-4.

THE PITT News, Wednesday, April 3, 1987

Austin gearing up for last year as Panther

By Celeste R. Phillips

For The Pitt News

Teryl Austin, a safety on the
University of Pittsburgh football
team from Sharon, Pa., is prepar—
ing to play his last spring in-
trasquad blue-gold game at Pitt
Stadium on April 25, and a lot of
things are expected from the fifth-
year _senior.

First, I want to come
out of spring practice a
starter. Secondly, I
want to stay away from
injury, especially the
ones I can prevent.

— Teryl Austin

Austin's 1986 season was
marred with injuries, but he was

still able to receive some notable
recognition. Named to The Foot-

~ ball News Almost Al|—American

Team and listed by The Sporting
News as an All-America prospect,
Austin's future does indeed seem
bright for his final season at Pitt.

Head coach Mike Gottfried
made some very progressive
changes when he came to Pitt in

1985. The bulk of those changes

came in the defensive secondary,
which helped convert the ques-
tionable unit into one of the
strongest forces of the entire
squad. Teryl Austin was a big part
of those changes.

He was switched from corner-
back to safety after a junior year
in which he was fifth in the na-
tion with seven interceptions.
Austin was never really able to
settle into the position because of
his injury-plagued season, but he
says now he's ready not to just
settle into the position but to
master it.

”I started off fine but when you
get hurt, you lose your timing,”
he explained. ”When you play
safety it's timing, but now I'm ad-
justing.”

Austin said that along with the
safety position comes a lot of new
responsibilities that he has
learned to take in stride.

’’I didn't mind; it really didn't
matter,” he said. ”You just get to
a point where you want to play,
and it really doesn't matter
where.”

There are many changes in the
current Pitt squad, differences
which have really changed the
team, according to Austin.

”Last year, the adjustment to
the new coaches was different,”
hgaid. ”You really didn't know

what to expect. This year, we
know what to expect. We know
the coaches, and we can put
more effort into what we're do-
ing on the field.”

And putting more effort into
what is going on on the field is ‘
exactly what Pitt's defensive
coordinatorjohn Fox has in mind
for his secondary. Austin said Fox
is preparing them during spring
practice to be more attentive on
the field and not to give up so
many crucial plays. ‘ ' ‘

”The biggest thing we're work-
ing on is trying not to give up so
many yards in the critical situa-
tions. We had a habit of doing

that. We need to -get in cohesion ,_

with the group, so the big play
doesn't happen,” he said.

Another adjustment for Austin
was getting used to practicing
without his other fellow seniors.
Because he was redshirted during
his freshman year, he didn't turn
in his cleats and pads as his fel-
low seniors did.

”I feel funny with those guys
leaving,” he said. ”I don't have
those same guys that were
around when I came here. Reg-
gie Smith, Tony Woods  they're
all gone now.” _

Austin isn't surrounded by

strangers, though. In fact, as one

of two fifth-year seniors in the
secondary, he will be looked

upon to lead the pack. This is a
responsibility to which he feels
he can adhere.

”I’ve been playing the secon-
dary since my freshman year, and
I try to help out when I can,” he
said.

All the added responsibilities
havn’t stopped Austin from set-
ting some personal goals for his
upcoming final season in a Pitt
Panther uniform. ‘

”First, I want to come out of
spring practice a starter.‘Second-
ly, I want to try and stay away
from injury, especially‘ the ones
I can prevent,” he said. ”But real-
ly, I just want to play the best that
I can and see what happens.”

Penn State's game plan may be altered

By Maud S. Beelman

Associated Press Writer

STATE COLLEGE, Pa. — Facing,
the task of rebuilding almost his
entire football team, Penn State
coach Joe Paterno said Tuesday
he may be forced to deviate from
his traditional, and so far success-
ful, game plan.

”Everything has been predicat-

led to put the burden on the
defense  because we kicked so
well, and we had good people on
defense who had a lot of ex-
perience,” Paterno said during
his first meeting with reporters
since spring practice began.

’’I don't know whether we can
play that way right now, because
we don't know whether we've
got that kind of defense,” he said.
”We may end up being different.
We may have to throw the ball
more. We may have to go into a
football game thinking we've got

to score more points than I felt we

,had_ to do last yea_r_.”_

After 5-fe'r.fect season and the
second national championship
for the Nittany Lions, Paterno is
faced with reassembling a team
that is missing'17 starters. That list
includes All-America defensive
back Shane Conlan, lead running
back D.J. Dozier, kicker Massimo
Manca and punter John Bruno. ln
all, four starters return on defense
and three on offense.

The Lions have traditionally
based their offense on the run,
but a lack of experience and
depth —— four starters are gone
from the offen_sive line +— as well
as a new quarterback and a fast
receiving corps could change
that.

Senior Matt Knizner’s ascen-
dance to the lead passing role, for
which he waited two years, is
one of the few moves with which
the coach is comfortable.

Knizner, who Paterno predicts

will be ”an outstanding quarter-
back,” attempted only 36 passes
last year. But his 82-yard touch-
down bomb to Eric Hamilton in
the 34-14 win over Pittsburgh
was the third longest pass play in
the school's history and the lon-
gest since 1971.
' Beyond Knizner, Paterno sees
a void of experience at backup
quarterback and has been work-
ing this spring to correct that.

Blair Thomas is expected to
take over the rushing load with
Dozier’s graduation. In last year's
sophomore season, the Philadel-
phia native set a Penn State
record averaging 8.4 yards a
carry. ’

”Blair is obviously a very, very
fine running back, but nobody
else has carried the ball much be-
sides him," Paterno said.

Thomas’ duties will depend on
how the offense develops, Pater-

no added.

’’If we had our way we'd like
to play it a little bit the way we've
played with Dozier and (Curt)
Warner, where we use a good
tailback with a good fullback in
front of him,” Paterno said. ”l
think a lot depends on how fast
the fullbacks come along. A lot
depends on what kind of football
we decide to play as to what
we're going to do with Blair, but
Blair's got to be a very, very key
guy in our offense.”

. Practicing at fullback are Chris

Thorpe, who suffered a severe
neck injury in preseason practice
last ‘August and was cleared by
doctors in February to return to
football, ‘Sean Redman and Sean
Barowski.

”But they're all just learning

right now,” he said.

son, who redshirted last year be-
cause of nagging injuries, is
running track again this spring,
but Paterno said he hasn't had a
chance to evaluate him.

Paterno delayed the start of
spring drills four days until March
28 to give players more time to
recover from what was described
as minor injuries. But they con-
tinue to plague the team in prac-
tice, he said.

In addition, bad‘ weather that
has cut outdoor kicking practice
and scheduling conflicts with
classes have contributed to a
”spotty” spring practice so far,
the coach complained.

as many areas that we've got tc’>/

”You couldn't have any more

to get done this spring.”

”You have to pay your dues to
become a manager,” he said.
’’Generally you have to go to the

\ minor leagues. There's not much

pay involved and some of the
better-known black players have
been able to get into better fields
— and make a better living in that
way.” .
Aaron said, ”You have to
remember that Joe Torre, Ted
Williams and others didn't go to
the minor leagues before manag-
ing. I draw the conclusion that
baseball is still somewhat
prejudiced in hiring blacks as
managers and front-office people.

‘ I think that any blind person can ‘

see that.”

Aaron, a member of the Hall of
Fame, is entering his 11th year as
director of player development
for the Braves. He briefly cam-
paigned to be commissioner of
baseball before the owners select-
ed Peter Ueberroth to succeed
Bowie Kuhn.

The first black manager was
Hall‘ of Famer Frank Robinson,
who became Cleveland's man-

later managed the San Francisco

There now are no black

managers in the big leagues.

Williams at full strength in spring drills

By Thomas Danyluk
Staff Writer

For Reggie Williams, it's a frus-
trating trip back to the ol' gridiron
drawing board — you know, the
X's and the O’s and ”here's—
where—you-goes-when—the-
quarterback-throws."

The 6-2, 185—pound "but I
picked up 10 pounds since I've
been out" wide reciever is in the
process of getting back into form
when a devastating injury
[broken fibula] in last season's
Purdue game sidelined him for
the remainder of the year. He was
granted a medical redshirt by the
NCAA.

‘ 

. As I've said before, I
guarantee Reggie
would have had 80 or
90 receptions had he
stayed healthy — he
was that effective.

— Mike Gottfried

j"""'—' 9 9

"Reggie was tearing up," said
Pitt head coach Mike Gottfried.
”He was off to an incredible
pace, then got hurt right off the
bat against the Boilermakers. It
was a huge loss for us.”

What Williams was in the
process of tearing up were Pan-
ther single-season receiving
records. In under three games,
the sophomore from Beaver Falls,
Pa., pulled in 17 catches for a to-

tal of 239 yards — 14.1 yards per ,

catch. "As I've said before, I
guarantee Reggie would have
had 80 or 90 receptions had he
stayed healthy — he was that ef-
fective.” stressed Gottfried.

Especially during Pitt's heart-
breaking 14-14 tie with North
Carolina State. Williams hauled
in 12 passes for over 120 yards
and was in the process of grand-
ly projecting himself onto the
Eastern football scene. Says Gott-
fried, "He was fantastic.”

"The Wolfpack coverage kept
dropping back into pretty deep
zone, so I just ran patterns under-
neath the coverage ” said Wil-

 

Reggie Williams was on pace for an "80 to 90" catch season

before he broke his _leg.

liams. "John [Congemi] threw the
ball my way all day. It was excit-
ing having a big game like that.”

But the N.C. State game is long
gone, buried in a disappointing
5-5-1 season. 1987 spring foot-
ball is the newest topic of conver-
sation. Along with Reggie’
Williams, that is. .

”I'd say he's exactly where he
left off last season,” said Gott-

well, and he's providing the team
with a great deal of leadership on
the field. I'm happy with his
progress.”

Williams is also elated with the
direction of his comeback trail. "I
can honestly say that I'm 100 per-
cent healthy. The key for me now
is getting back into shape.

"At that scouting exercise [Pro
Day] we had a few weeks back,
I ran a 4.68 in the 40. Of course,
that wasn't my best time, -
which is about 4.58 — since I
have put on some extra weight
over the off-season. I wasn't real-
ly supposed to participate, but
I've got to start getting into shape
sometime.”

Williams modelshimself after
San Francisco 49er receiver Jer-
ry Rice, "That guy is awesome.
He's got great hands and is too

fast,” said Williams, who is cur-

rently battling sophomore Darrin
Gillaspie for the second starting
receiver position alongside Bill
Osborn.

"We're not really battling each
other, though,” said Williams.
”That sounds like we're out there
trying to kill each other for the
job. We both want to contribute
to the team, and I try to help Dar-
rin as much as I can. I'm sure the
same holds true for him, too,” he
said. "It's not a personal fight —

. we're really good friends, so what

happens on the field stays on the
field."

And if the Panthers plan to be
successful this season, that's ex-
actly where Williams will have to
be — on the field, not in a "mind
if I sign your cast, Reggie?"

PHILADELPHIA — Ron Hex-
tall, the Philadelphia Flyers’
rookie goaltender, has passed his
80—game quiz and starts his final
examination Wednesday night
when the Flyers host the New
York Rangers in an NHL playoff
openen

Hextall, 22, led the league in
games played (66), victories (3 7),
saves percentage (.902) and
finished third in goals—against
average (3.00).

But if you believe the NHL line

A that a goalie isn't a goalie until

he's proven he can win under

~ playoff pressure, Hextall has just

begun to play.
Although they won't admit it,
Hextall has some Flyers’ execu-

CIEIEIDEIEIEIEIIZIIIIIZIEJCIIJIIIEIIZICJEIEIDEJEICIEIEJCIEIEIEICIDCIDEIDDEIEIEI-D

tives sweating.

At the start of the season, the
Flyers decided they couldn't win
a Stanley Cup with Bob Froese in
goal. Hextall replaced Froese,

who had come within an eyelash .

of winning the best-in-goal award
last season.

Froese then began a relentless
campaign to be traded. The Flyers
finally gave him to the Rangers
for Kjell Samuelson, at best an
average defenseman.

Rangers Coach Phil Esposito
hasn't disclosed who will open
the best-of-seven game series in
goal — Froese or John Vanbies-
brouck. In any event, sometime
during the series, Hextall will go
against Froese.

Hextall is conscious of his po-
sition.

people wondering if I'll come
through under playoff pressure,”
said the goalie during a break
from practice for the first of two
games here. The series moves to
New York Saturday and Sunday.

”That’s part of the job,” said
Hextall. ”Sure, I have something
to prove in the playoffs. I have to
prove I can do it.”

The Flyers won the Patrick Di-
vision this year for the third
straight year and were 24 points
better than the fourth—place
Rangers. But last season, they
were eliminated in the first round
by the fourth-place Rangers.

Neither team played well as the

long regular season droned to a
close. Philadelphia lost three of

its last four and has been 6-6-1 at
home since March 3, I2-13-2

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, April 8, 1987

Dec. 26. In the final game Sun-
day, the Flyers lost 9-5 to the
New York Islanders and blew the
Jennings Trophy for best goals
against average.

The Rangers have been worse,
3-8-0 in the last I 1, including an
8-3 loss in the finale. Esposito
takes no consolation that his team
was 4-3-0 against Philadelphia in
the regular season, surprisingly
3-1 away and 1-2 at home.

”Everybody has to recharge
himself [for the Flyers],” said Es-
posito. ”This is a new season, and
I don't care what anyone has
done so far.” A

The Rangers basically are a
team with good offense and ques-
tionable defense. ,

The Flyers’ Tim Kerr equaled
his career high 58 goals this sea-
son. He scored 26 of the team's

Warriors '
respond

OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) —-
When Coach George Karl says it
took a lot of patience to get the
Golden State Warriors into the
National Basketball Association
playoffs for the first time in 10
years, believe him. '

' Consider that in Karl's first sea-
son with the Warriors, his lead-
ing scorer, forward Purvis Short,
has missed much of the season
because of injuries. His top draft
choice, Chris Washburn, was a
washout, played poorly, showed

up late for practices and finally 6

Karl, who was seriously'CO..f",,S_i_-

 last year, ,wasn’t_sure he wanted

to keep center Joe Barry Carroll
at the start of the season, and he

tonio Sunday night after a playoff-

gerald and Director of Player Per-
sonnel Jack McMahon. _

”One of the smart things that
Fitz and Jack McMahon pound-
ed into my mind over the sum-
mer was don't make change for
the sake of change,” Karl said.
”Our patience — and I'm not say-

really paid dividends.” A

Short has had patience, too.
Until_now, he and centerjerome

Hunting for a summer job can be a traumatic experience. You pound the streets day after
day searching for that ‘perfect’ job and you still wind up flipping burgers at McDonald's.

Sound familiar?

This summer, you don't have to get stuck with a dead—end job.
If you're looking for excitement and like to travel, The Pitt News may be the best place to

be this summer.

Writing for The Pitt News can provide you with valuable experience, introduce you to a
