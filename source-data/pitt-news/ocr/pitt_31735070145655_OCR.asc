Pitt students help area

seniors in snowstorm

Eric Shannon

Staﬁ'Writer_

Pitt students reached out Wednesday
night to 1,100 senior citizens cut off from
essentials, such as heat and medicine, be-
cause of the winter snowstorm.

Twenty—four students camped out in

an almost empty WQED television station
studio, supplied by a night’s worth of pizza
and pop. Using the phones WQED uses for
its pledge drives, the students volunteered
to make a different kind of pledge —— one
with the seniors of the city.

During “Snowmageddon 2o1o,” many
students might have been excited to miss
three or four days of classes. That same
snow, however, presents a very different
— and dangerous —— situation for many
less mobile seniors.

“I just talked to a lady that couldn’t get
to the doctor,” student Fata Karva said. “She
said she was going to have to miss her chemo
treatment.”

City Council members Patrick Dowd and
Theresa Kail—Smith anticipated these kinds

of problems and worked together to orga-

nize the volunteers.
The city’s 311 line — dedicated to non-
emergency services —— has been active in

taking the calls of many people, including

seniors, affected by the snow. However,
Dowd and Smith said they knew that many
seniors were not calling in. '

“These are the kinds of people we’re try-
ing to reach out to. They haven’t made calls
yet, but they might not have heat, they’re
out of oxygen or out of insulin. That’s who
make up the 1,100,” Dowd said.

By contacting Mayor Luke Ravenstahl’s
office and the group Seniorlnterests, a city
organization dedicated to the welfare of
seniors, the Council members were able
to create a list of the 1,100 seniors, WQED
lent out its studio and telephones for the
event.

As for the actual volunteering, Dowd said
that he speciﬁcally wanted to get students
involved.

“We really wanted to tap into that young
energy,” he said

By getting into contact with Shawn
Brooks, director of Residence Life, organiz—
ers found 24.resident assistants and other
Pitt students who wanted to help the older
population of Pittsburgh. The volunteers
wrote down the seniors’ problems and told
them to WQED so that the city could address
the issues. ‘

“The main thing is to let people know
that we’re there,” Dowd said. “If there are
any problems the students will take note of
it, and we’ll make follow-up calls.”

  

University:

Saturdays  

to make up snow days

Liz Navratil
News Editor

Students will make up missed classes '
from this past Monday and Tuesday on
Saturdays. V

Pitt spokesmanjohn Fedele said stu-

‘ dents will make up Monday’s missed class-

es Saturday, March 27. They willmake

up Tuesday’s missed classes on Saturday,
April 17, the weekend before the ﬁnal
week of classes. Students will not make up
Wednesday’s classes.

Fedele said students with Saturday
classes should coordinate with their pro-
fessors to see which classes they should
attend.

Professors can choose to make other
arrangements to account for the missed
days and should tell their students within
the week if they plan to do so, he said.

He said the registrar’s office will work
with instructors to make sure they have
classrooms available, should any conflicts
arise.

The decision came from the provost’s
office, Fedele said.

into the university,

it’s a perfect fit;

includingonlyoutrageous sex, thoseﬁlms“  make

_ allsexacts seem dangerous, excessive, and intheir

very convulsiveness, verging on violence.”

We face this problem when dealing with the
presentation of sex. We can strike sex from our
media and bury our heads, or we can grandstand
it in all its splendor and make sex some aberrant,
genital circus. ‘ E

“I Love Lucy” or ‘The Real World” —— either
way, sex suffers and gets shuttled behind closed
doors. Either way, sex becomes unnatural.

Today, we aim to give sex the attention it de-
serves without falling into the free love trap of
neo-hippyism. When sexual revolution becomes
sexual anarchy, sexuality becomes amark of'sub—
culture, and chastity belts are ushered in amid
the confusion. t

It is with such careful consideration that The
Pitt News presents today’s Sex Edition. Modern

society is at a place where onecan no longer deny ’

that questions of sexuality need to be asked. _

Myths about safe sex dispelled

Liz Navratil
News Editor

By the time they ﬁnish their ﬁrst semester
of college, most people know the basics
of sexual health: Always wear a condom
to prevent STIs. Abstinence is the only
guaranteed method of birth control.

So this year, The Pitt News decided to
dig a little deeper for its “safe sex” piece.
Here’s what we found: ’

Myth: Simply keeping a condom free
of holes is enough.

Fact: Read the boxes twice. Most con-
dom companies put additional labels on
their packaging. Trojan, for example,
warns customers to avoid exposing con-
doms to direct sunlight or storing them
in wallets or places where temperatures
climb above 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Do-

ing so can compromise the quality of the
latex, which has an average shelf life of
four to ﬁve years if properly cared for,
Trojan writes on its website.

Myth: Students should get regularly
tested for sexually transmitted infec-
tions. .

Fact: This myth rests on a technicality.
Technically, students only get tested for a
sexually transmitted infection when they
have symptoms for one. Students who
don’t have symptoms for an STI and sim-
ply want to see if they’re “clean” should
instead request a screening, Jaime Sidani,

a health educator in Student Health Ser-

vice, said in an e-mail. The student health
fee, which all full—time students pay with
their tuition, covers one HIV screening
every 12 months for_no additional charge.
This is an _oral swab test, and it will pro-

duce results in 20 minutes. Students can-

also get one free screening for most other ’

STIs every 12 months, as well. Sidani said
a clinician decides which STIs to test
people for based on their sexual history
and risk factors.

Myth: Gardasil, the vaccine often
used to prevent HPV, is only for wom-
en.

Fact: This past October, the Food and
‘Drug Administration approved the use of
Gardasil for boys and men aged 9 to 26.
While women use the vaccine to prevent
the types of HPV, or.Human Papilloma—
virus, which most commonly cause cer-
vical, vulvar or vaginal cancer, men and
boys and can now use it to prevent two
types that cause genital warts. HPV is
the most common sexually transmitted
infection and a leading cause of genital
warts, according to a news release from
the FDA. Both genders take the vaccine,

which is produced by Merck 8: Company
Inc., as a series ofthree shots, which are
spread out over a 6-month period. Men
should contact their doctors to see if they
are prepared to give them the Gardasil
vaccine. Some places,,such as Planned
Parenthood, have reported a lag between
the change in guidelines and the avail-
ability of thevaccine for men.

Myth: Birth control and vaccines
are always expensive.

Fact: Taking care of your sexual health ‘

doesn’t always have to take a toll on your
wallet. We all know it’s easy to find cheap
condoms on campus —- Student Health
Service offers them at a reduced price,
and the Campus Women’s Organization
often has them, as do other groups. Merck
runs a program that offers free shots to
some women who make less than $21,660
per year. Generic versions of some forms

‘Abstinence in college

is no easy task, but
the rewards are  
great, students say.

Richard Rosengarten V

Staﬁ‘ Writer

With much ado about relationships this time of
year, certain campus and community members
retaintradit1'onalviews on whatto do — andwhat
not to do — in dating.

— Fatherjoseph Kibler, a priest at the Pittsburgh
OratoryinOakland, is one ofthese people, and he
had aword forwhat oughtto be atthe foundation
of a romantic relationship: “Friendship.” pg

Located onBayard Street nottoofarﬁpm cam-
pus, the oratory and its members serve ‘Catholic
university students at Pitt, Carnegie Mellon and
Chatham. Students go there for ritual obser-
vance, counseling and killer foosball games with
priests.

Kibler champions what helikes to call“Catho—
lic wisdom.” Among other things, it’s part of dis-
ceming one’s vocation, what were called to do in
life, or just what college" students spend most of
their time tryingto ﬁgure out.

Dating can be a big part of that process, and

the Catholic wisdom says to put physical intimacy
in the backseat —— a personal struggle, as Kibler
understands it.

“Chastity is ﬁrst of all a state of mind before
it’s a state ofbody,” he said. “That’s the ﬁrstthing
to understan .”

group at Pitt.

Fellowship of Catholic University Students.

Thefveboth have seen howrelationships are
important to college studepts and how certain
elements of college candistractﬁomanabstinent
approach to dating.

V "‘There are deﬁnitelylpressures in a college
setting — partying,  things like that,”
Petrany said.

The way women dress on the weekends, Sar— V

tori said, doesn’t make it any easier. Kibler quoted
a sentiment attributed to Popejohn Paul II:
“The problem with it is not that it reveals too
muchbutthatitreveals too little aboutthe person,”
he said. “It provides somebodywith the occasion
for someone to View you as an object and not as
the subject of dignity as a person, as somebody

with hopes, dreams and avocation, speciﬁcally a .

vocation to love, in the profoundest sense.”

The ﬁrst time I told a girl I loved her, I
was awkwardly given an uncomfortable
giggle, and then politely shown the door.
The ﬁrst time a girl told me that she loved
me was through a text message. I was at
Fuel '8: Fuddle and got the simple “I luv u.”
at around 1 a.m. A

While my heart fluttered for a few sec-
onds, the next morningl reconsidered the

_ message. That she wasn’t able to tell me in

person or use correct spelling mildly in-
sulted me. Maybe it'isn’t time to be saying
it if you can’t do it in person first.

Texting has undeniably revolutionized,
relationships. It’s there in every step of
dating: the cute, awkward beginnings, the
chewy middles and the harsh, cruel ends.
For s_ending a little thought that no one
else would care about except your part—
ner, maintaining a relationship distancing
thousands of miles, or just trying to get to
know someone better, texting will ‘always
be there.

Texting has especially left its mark on

The social rules of cell phone courtship

asking for a date. No simple text saying,
“Hey, last nite was awsum, lunch today?”
or “Yo, good call on the whips and chains,
Panera lata?” You would even sometimes
have to go through the parents first, try-
ing to explain why their son’s or daugh-
ter’s neck is mutilated with black and blue
hickeys.

Functioning initially as the modern-
day telegram spliced with AIM—lingo
—“omfg,” “ttyl,” and “lol” — the text
message evolved into a whole new form
of communication with its own set of rules
and protocol. V

In an informal conversation with three
Pitt seniors, I discussed the etiquette of
text messaging. The scenario: You met
someone the night before, were into them
and then the next day wanted to text them.
The texting could be to pursue anything
between some sort of romantic relation-
ship or the plain old friends—with—beneﬁts
scenario.

The general rules were swiftly and
unanimously agreed upon: no texting
before noon, and morning texts mean
morning hangovers. Don’t try to start a
conversation, if it happens it happens, but

For The Pitt News

We, at the Moustache Club of America,
know that you’re not comfortable with
the term “date.” That puts a lot of pres~
sure on you. What about if we say We’re
hanging out? ;

Okay, still too much pressure. Plus,
hanging out sounds so 20th century. So
let’s say We’re doing nothing. How_does
that sound? - ,

Great. We’re glad you like that. So here
we are, doing nothing. We love doing noth-
ing with you. It’s so much fun.

Wait, so now you’re saying you like stay-
ing active? Going out and doing stuff? So
do we! ‘We love doing stuff, especially when
we go out. _ ,-

We hear you. There are deﬁnitely nights
when it’s good to stay in. Sometimes we
just like to curl up in our pajamas with a
few good books. It’s a jungle out there and

, so forth.

No, we aren’t asking you to spend all of

- your time at our dirty, rathole of a place. '

We promise we’ll come up with interesting

. ideas for dates. '

Yes, we know we agreed this wasn’t a
date. But if we were dating, we would come
up with interesting ideas for dates. Huh?
You don’t want to date us? But you asked
us to have coffee with you!

Oh, that makes sense. When a girl says

We love doing nothing uiith you.

  
 
 
 

that she wants to have coffee with you, she’s

_ really trying to tell you that she doesn’t .

want to have coffee with you. She was just
being nice.

Now let’s see if we understand: Right
now We’re doing nothing, this isn’t a date
and you didn’t want to go on it —— even
though you asked us to go.

That’s it, then? Good. Lucky for you,
We’re a total doormat. We don’t have any
feelings. We’re perfect to do nothing with
and we won’t‘ challenge you in any way.
You matter, but we don’t.‘ We’re just going

to sit here and listen to you ramble about ‘

your doubts, hopes and dreams. We won’t
even point out how contradictory they are.
We’ll never try to turn this nothing. into
something. ’

So youwant to tell us all about this awe—‘
some guy you’re looking for, who will love
you with all of his heart, except that he’ll

Q

The scents behind sexual attraction

Keith Gillogly
Opinions Editor

A party is not a party unless there’s dancing in-
volved. It’s thekeyﬁmfactor, even moresothanthe
proper beverages — although the two go together
mutually. Give me a few drinks, and it’s time to
hit the dance ﬂoor. The beverages, of course, re-
duce any lingering uneasiness over the ensuing
ﬂailing limbs, body twists and in my case, heavy
doses of air guitar playing. I’ve even been known
to hold downthe dance ﬂoor solo, butthafs never
a good scene.

Consider the beneﬁts of dancing compared
to, say, loitering in the corner avoiding the dance
ﬂoor like it were some metal-concert mosh pit

suitable for only the most daring. For the calorie-
concerned, perhaps you’ll burn off a few of the
beverages now sloshingaroundin your stomach.
If you actually have rhythm, now’s your time to
shine. I guarantee you’ll have moreﬁin out on the
ﬂoor, too. But here’s a beneﬁt you might not have
considered: pheromonetransmission. A
Pheromones are tiny chemical signaler subi
stances produced by humans and animals such
as rodents and  Even plants produce them.
Animals and insects emit pheromones through
a variety of means and for a variety of commu-
nicative purposes. In humans, pheromones are
perhaps mostwellknownbecause ofthe supposed
role they play in inﬂuencing sexual attraction.
Unlike in some insects, however, in humans the

substance has avery limited detection range once
in the air. The male body gives off pheromones,
they permeate through the air and any nearby
women quicl<lylatch onto the potentyetinaudible
mating call’. Actually, not quite.

Here’s a bit more on the science: The phero— ,

mones involved in sexual attraction are produced

during the synthesis of testosterone, Donald De-.

Franco, a professor in Pitt’s Department of Phar-
macology and Chemical Biology, said. Phero-
mones can be spread through sweat, but they’re
also present in saliva. The more a male sweats,
the more pheromones he potentially transmits
through the sweat and to a'mild degree, as an

aerosol. Nasal olfactory receptor cells in women -

sniff? Maybe, but probably not.
“Ourvisual senses are much more acute than
our olfactory ones. We’re not rats and mice. We
don’t rely on olfactory cues for much of our social
interactions,”~DeFranco said. ‘This doesn’t mean
there’s not some contribution from some olfac-
tory cues, butl would say it’sprobably less of a
contribution than other cues.”
Even before the guy swallows his quota of
drinks and takes that ﬁrst bold step toward the

dance ﬂoor, he faces a critical choice: wearing

or forgoing deodorant. By traditional metric, he

should be more concerned about body odor. Then _

again, the scent of deodorant could mask the ef-
fectiveness ofhis ragingpheromones. In earnest,
he’s probably better off sticking with the stick.

Your iPod is more fun than you think.

Jocelyn Meehan
Staﬁ" Writer

Your roommate’s out with Mr. Wonderful, and
you’re completely bloated from the combina-
tion of the box of chocolates he gave her and last
weekend’s stale Pabst Blue Ribbon.

You look at your watch and realize it’s about
that time to grab the only lover that’s been there _
for you through it all —— your vibrator.

But even your trusty vibrator’s broke, too
many miles —— time for an upgrade.
Club Vibe, a new sex toy made by the com-

- 1

pany OhMiBod, is avi_brator that can change how
you experience personal pleasure and music,
making your old toy seem prehistoric.
Basically, if you want to -venture beyond the
vibrator’s automatic settings of fast vibes, slow
vibes, and consistent pulses, you can plug the
pink bullet into your MP3 player and enjoy as it

~ at gyrates to the beat of your favorite song.

Trust me, even Susan Boyle’s music will
be hot and feel great. But the song, of course,
should be chosen carefully. Perhaps something
mellow for relaxation, like Iron and Wine, or
Dragonforce’s “Through the Fire and Flames”
(for obvious reasons). A

If you’re not sold yet and are feeling a little
more adventurous, Club Vibe also comes pack-
aged with apair ofblack lacy panties, builtwith a
special pocket (you know where) for the bullet.

Yes, this means you canbe on the move while
gettinginthe mood, because Club Vibe also picks
up and reacts to ambient sounds in the room.

Get off in the club as you dance, or wear it to
a movie starringjohnny Depp! V

Watch out when you’re at the theater, though,
because Club Vibe could sound like a cell phone
on vibrate, so just leave if you’re asked to turn
it off.

The point is, Club Vibe is an modern toythat

    

goes beyond physical pleasure and represents a
new ideal for “loving your body.” -

A “special note” signed by founder Suki says
Club Vibe is “a symbol of liberation, reﬂecting
new andprogressive attitudes towards personal
pleasure for the young and the young at heart
 People who are comfortable with their bod-
ies, knows what feels good and who not only
aren’t afraid to admit it, are empowered to go
after it.” .

Simply because Mr. Wonderful hasn’t come
around yet, that doesn’t mean you have to wait.

And no offense to him, but he can’t hit Susan

After ,‘Age of
Aquarius’ sexual
liberation, asexual
people are targets of
prejudice. O  

David Beitzel
Columnist

Sex is everywhere, especially when you’re not
having it.” _ ' ‘

One group of people says that, for them,
sex does not matter. It’s not that they choose
to avoid sex’ — as that would be called celi-
bacy —— but rather that-they do not feel sexual
attraction toward anyone of any gender. They
are asexual.

Asexual people feel love. They might desire
platonic or romantic relationships. They just
don’t want to have sex. Basically, think of your

‘ best friends. You might love them and want to ‘

spend the rest of your life with them, but you
don’twant to have sex with them, and they don’t
. want to want to have sex with you.

Many asexual people are still capable ofhav—
ing sex —— some engage in it, and some mas-
turbate. They feel pleasure, but not attraction.
Asexual‘ people do not want sex, but some still
have it an act which appears to b_e to acquiesce

outside pressures.

Theoretically, asexuality has existed for as

long as humanity. In the 1980s, The Smiths '

singerMorrisseyfamously claimed to be“non—
sexual.” '
Only recently, though, has an emerging

network of support groups and awareness
campaigns promoted asexuality as a normal T

biological occurance. Asexual people are li-

- nally organizing, while the rest of the world

still struggles to understand their sexuality. It’s
hard for outsiders to understand why someone
wouldn’t want sex. It feels good, it’s a primal
instinct and everyone else wants it, so what
makes you so different? Sexual people might
dismiss asexuality as genophobia (the fear of
sex), coitophobia (the fear of intercourse), or just
plain sex—hating. Often, asexuality is conﬂated
with sexual aversion disorder and hypoactive
sexual desire disorder. '

Not many scientiﬁc studies have researched

- human asexuality in depth, and the term is still

ﬁnding out how to ﬁt in the popular lexicon.
The New Scientist published a collection of

the bits‘ of asexual study so far. In the 19905, a

conglomeration of scientists studied sexuality

‘ in rams. By placing rams with members of the
. same or opposite gender, they found that about

2-3 percent of the rams showed no interest in
sex with either partner type, while 5-7 percent
of the rams displayed homosexual tendencies.
This suggested that asexuality in sexually active
species —— such as rams instead of amoebae
— is not a choice. Some rams appeared to be

Pitt students talk out o\bout being out.

Sam Stahl
Columnist

The average restingheart rate for a 22-year-old
male is approximately 72 beats—per-minute.
However, in a moment of stress pupils dilate,
skin ﬂushes and heart rates surge. Perhaps there _
are few moments as pulse quickening as the one
in which a person decides to come out of the
closet.

“My heart was beating so fast,” a Pitt senior
said, who has requested anonymity because he

has not yet come out to his parents.

“I came out last spring to my best friend at
the time, who’s also gay. Iwas so scared,” he said. I
had gotten out of class earlythat day and for some
reason, I knewifl didn’t say anythingthenlwould
never come out. Itwas really eatingat me. There
had been so many countless times I just wanted
to be honest, but I was scared about how people
would view me after I said those words.”

Despite his initial anxiety, the senior said
that he is happier now that he has come out to
his friends.

I used to have so much anger and sadness that I
suppressed in ‘my unconscious. Once I said it, all
those bad feelings disappeared and I’ve felt more
conﬁdent. Ithink coming out has made me more
understanding and empathetic,” he said. “I realize
that so many people maybe actinga certain way
because they are not ready to admit something
‘to anyone — especially themselves. ”

Dr. Kevin Bursley, a licensed psychologist for

Pitt student Rebecca Kritz and her boyfriend, .

Micah Urbach, ﬁrst conversed about reli-
gion. F ‘

They met with an icebreaker at an introduc-
tory session before a year—long trip to Israel.

, The trip was a gap-year program that takes

place the year in between college and high
school, called YoungJudaea’s Year Course.
By the time the pair was on the bus home

[Faith cmd dating make interesting bedfellows in college.

from their ﬁrst meeting, they had decided to
date exclusively. . g

It was easy for Kritz and Urbach to connect.
Both had the same criteria for a romance:
potential for a lasting relationship and similar
interests. .

For Kritz, sharing her partner’s religious
faith is necessary for a successﬁil relationship
because sharing another re1igion’s traditions
is frowned upon by her family, community
and religion. .

“If he wasn’tJewish, there would be no
point,” she said.

It is important for Kritz to marry ajewish
man‘to not only uphold her own traditions,
but also for the ﬁiture of her children.

Rebecca Denova, a religious studies profes-
sor at Pitt, believes the issue of interfaith mar-
riage is connected to the “rearing of children”
in order to perpetuate the belief systems of a
community. ‘

“For instance, when a Catholic marries
a Protestant, the Protestant is encouraged
to, convert,” Denova said, .“and part of that
process includes a vow to raise the children
as Catholics.”

Kritz, 19, decided to attend Pitt while Ur-
bach,.20, is enrolled at Montclair State Uni-
versity in Newjersey. *

from the long distance, is relatively easygo-

It is not always this way for student rela-

When watching a ﬁlm, there are few things
as.(_secretly) enjoyable as coming across a
good sex scene. Whether it isan abundance
of nudity or merely a beautiful cinematic
display of our most carnal fantasies, movie
sex scenes allow us the opportunity to in-

dulge ourselves without fear of pregnancy or _

awkward morning-after conversation.

' These are The Pitt News’ favorite sex
scenes from the past decade or so that every
college student should be familiar with.’

10.) “A History of Violence” (2005) —
The initial resistance and eventual submis-
sion from Edie Stall (Maria Bello), Tom
Stall’s (Viggo Mortensen) wife, makes for
the perfect representation of rough sex on

9.) “Unfaithful” (2002) —— Connie’s (Di-
ane Lane) conﬂicted feelings of loyalty for
her husband (Richard Gere) and lust for her
lover (Olivier Martinez) serve as foreplay for
the Viewers of their forbidden affair, which
climaxes in their bathroom-stall consum-
mation. ‘ ~ ' _

8.) “Basic Instinct” (1992) —— The conflict
of interest that is Nick (Michael Douglas)
and Catherine’s (Sharon Stone) sexual affair
ﬁnally. culminates when Catherine gives in
to his advances while Roxy (Leilani Sarelle)
watches what Douglas’ Nick describes as “the
f*ck of the century.” And still, uncrossing

(Kate Winslet) and Brad (Patrick Wilson)
prove that suburbia isn’t all that boring with
their naughty tryst on top of a washing ma:
chine. They gave “rinse cycle” an entirely
new meaning.

6.) “Atonement” (2007) — In the adap-
tation of Ian McEwan’s epic novel, Cecilia
(Keira Knightley) and Robbie’s (James McA-
voy) bookcase love making certainly makes
it worth sitting through the remaining 90
minutes of pure depression. Who said read-
ing couldn’t be sexy?

5.) “Mulholland Drive” (2001) — In a
surreal David Lynch ﬁlm that takes view-
ers so far down the rabbit hole they forget
which way is up, it helps to see a glimpse
of the light when Naomi Watts and Laura
Elena Harring’s characters decide to make
out while topless in bed. It still doesn’t make
much sense within the movie, but I don’t
think anyone’s complaining.

4.) “Shortbus” (2006) — It is impos-
sible to pinpoint a single sex scene in a
ﬁlm notorious for its near—constant use of
unsimulated sex witha cast of attractive
unknowns. Take your pick from the orgy in
a sex club, the medicine-ball sex, the auto-
fellatio or, a personal favorite, the daisy-
chain threesome. You will never think of
“The Star-Spangled Banner” in thesame
way ever again.

3.) “Y Tu Mama También” (2001) —
For those who haven’t seen this amazing
Spanish road-trip drama from “Harry Pot-
ter and the Prisoner of Azkaban” director
Alfonso Cuaron, you’re missing one of the
most touching and effective ﬁlms about
friendship ever made — that also happens
to include plenty of skin and sex. The ﬁnale,
in whichjulio (Gael Garcia Bernal) and Ten-
och (Diego Luna) ﬂeshout their friendship
together with the help of older Ana (Ana
Lopez Mercado), is simultaneously haunting
and titillating. A

2.) “Titanic” (1997) — It starts with a
portrait of Rose (Kate Winslet) wearing only
a garish jeweled necklace, and it ends with

Sex and academia

Editors’ note 4 4

The motivationbehind sexualfreedom rightly
becomes the recovery of the personhood ofthose
who fall outside of traditional sexual molds. ‘

To state what is nomial or acceptable in sex
marks those who are not grouped into normalcy
as failed persons.

Through sexualscholarship,we become aware
of the social dynamics that produce regulations,
and sex might be given backto those having it.

It is under such a banner of criticalevaluation
that The Pitt News publishes its Sex Edition. Filled
to the brim with sex toys, pheromones and un—
clothed bodies, issues of sexuality are addressed
with the same standards as what comes out in a_

regular newspaper.
To those who cry “modesty,” I remindyouthat

‘ good taste is not drawn on lines of abstinence

alone. The blind eye does as much damage as the

V worstvulgarity.Itisnotonlyourrightbutourduty

to treat and respect issues of sexuality.

On the other hand, to those who saywe do not
go far enough, we agree.

Ideally, sexuality would be temperately ad-
dressed daily, not limited to aValentine’s Day spe-
cial edition once ayear. Voicewould be given to ev-
erysexuallifestyle, and ourvocabularywould—~as
theoristjudith Butlerwrites — matchthe “gender
complexity that we have always been living.”

But human capability and social rigidity limit
us. We View our dialogue as a stepping stone, not
an endpoint.

You are asked, then, to read this Sex Edition
of The Pitt News with these issues in mind. It is

a not meantto shock or to sensationalize, because,

as we have learned, sex can hurt sometimes. It is
meant to inform and entertain. Sex is a part of
culture and deserves nothing less than our close
consideration. '

Sweaty, smelly love

Still, at least there’s a bright side should he forget
to wear deodorant.

Butwhat aboutthe dolled—up lady dancingthe
night away onthe now sweat-soaked dance ﬂoor?
Canshe getalittleboostfrompheromones‘? Nope.
Sheill have to rely on her good looks and ﬂashy
dance moves.

Women also produce testosterone,'butmostof
itis converted into estrogen, DeFrancosaid. There
is perhaps some level of pheromones in female

sweat, but they’re not able to stimulate attraction _

from the opposite sex.

There have only been a handful of legitimate
studies on pheromonesinhufnans inthe pastﬁve
to 10 years, DeFranco said. One study suggested
that women do experience an uptick in arousal
when exposed to male pheromones, but the feel-
ing isrft longstanding. Upon second and third
exposure, the women in thesmdy reported no

increase in attraction.
“Your best chance to use pheromones would
be to sweat a_ lot and get close and go for the first

encounter,” DeFranco said.‘“Ifyou’re onthe edge, ,
I maybe [pheromones] will push you over the top
and give you an attractiveness you don’t quite ‘

have.”
Inthe end, there’s no excuse notto getoutthere

on the dance ﬂoor. Even if you lack the moves of .
thelateMichae1Jackson, those handy pheromones  ,

could help cover for you.

Just don’t expectanyresults onparwith some i ‘
mythical love potion— even ifthe emittedphero—

inescapable swooning spell just because, she’s

picked up your scent. But hey,’ maybe you’ll score a

her number and then some.

“It’s really important to ﬁnd- sympathetic
people to talk with. That doesn’t have to be

Sometimes there’s a real sense of isolation, it
gets to be so lonely to not have anyone to talk

Bursely explained that college is a popular

time to come out because, “getting away from [

Scientists, French    
President agree on sex

Sexercise 4 13

chology that sexually active test subjects
responded better to stressors and had
lower blood pressure. Another study said
that simple ‘hugs work the same way.

With the promulgation of erectile dys- g

function drugs, older couplescan use sex
to stay active in the autumn of~their lives.
According to a 20-year study by English
researchers, intercourse helped abate
strokes and cardiovascular problems.
While you can’t_stay active by means of
football and hockey when you hit 70, you‘
can always make love (and swim). .

Sex might actually be one of the safer

forms of exercise, albeit unorthodox. Ma- y

jor injuries during intercourse are rare
— the odd injuries that sprinkle the Web
are more sources of humor‘ than serious
words of caution. ‘

Common injuries, according to a poll
conducted by a British erotic retail chain,
include brush burns and muscle pulls.
Widespread injuries from jogging look
similar: cuts and muscle soreness.

In terms of burning calories, sex ranks
among other workouts, though studies
struggle to pinpoint an exact number.
One pessimistic study said 30 minutes
of sex burns at minimum 85 calories,
but another study argued sex can burn
up to ﬁve calories per minute — or 300

‘ per hour.

In the end, it depends on the indi-
vidual. But Fitness Magazine devotes a

section of its website to sexual exercise,
or “sexercise.” _ _

Though the exact details '—- and ac—_
companying diagrams — may be unsuit-
able for publication, the site details what
positions work out what muscles. “The
more she does'buttock squeezes, the more
she could accentuate/her riding toward
him to .give herself a good glute work-
out,’? said Dr. Patti Britton, president of.
the American association for Sexuality
Educators.

It goes on from there. g

The ties between sexual pleasure and
exercise go beyond the bedroom. Dr.
Cindy Meston of the University of Texas
at Austin reported that physical exertion
beforehand heightens a woman’s sexual
experience later. If a romantic candle-
lit dinner doesn’t do the trick, try some
tennis next time.

ABC’s Dan Childs reported last year
that French President Nicolas Sarkozy
saw “improved sex” because of “exercise
that targets muscles in the pelvic floor.”
And the French know love. .

Even beyond sexual intercourse, ac-
tivities like pole dancing and strip aero-

‘bics work out the body just like any other

exercise. _

So it turns out, thoughit probably isn’t
your primary goal, having sex is great
for your health — provided you don’t
smoke after.

Not everyone isdoing it

of birth control, such as the Plan B emer-
gency contraceptive, are also available
and are sometimes cheaper. The generic
version of Plan B is levonorgestrel, a hor-

F mone that typically works by stopping an

ovary from releasing an egg, according to
the Food and Drug Administration. g

Myth: If you’re purposely not having ‘

‘sex in college, you’re alone.

Fact: As times have changed, so have
many students’ opinions about absti-
nence. - ‘ .

Sure, we’ve all heard the stereotype
that religious students on campus ab-
stain from sex. (Read more p. 8) But the
American College Health Association, a
national group that surveys college stu-
dents’ health practices, found in the fall
of 2008 that aboutfss percent of men
and about 33 percent‘ of women said that

kKlnaspa!.¥é:.3<S‘K';K'R,’31}-EFT’!

they hadn’t had sex (oral, vaginal or anal)

within the past year.

And a few more reminders:

‘— Have “the conversation” with your
partner before having sex. Are you ready
emotionally? Have you and your partner
been tested? How many partners have
each of you had in the past?

5‘If you are notjready to have sex with
someone, don’t!” Sidani said. She said
that’s one of the decisions students com-
monly regret.

— Know that your judgment will be-
come impaired when you drink alcohol
or do drugs.

—- If you’re sexually active, get

L

/screened regularly for sexually trans-

mitted infections.
—- If you have questions, contact your
doctor. ’

Chastity more than a belt, a commitment

Chaste 4 8

Action held in St. Paul’s Cathedral ev-
ery Sunday, and Sartori leads a small,
gender-separated bible discussion
in the Petersen Events Center every
Wednesday. There are many such

‘group sessions held by student lead-
ers throughout campus. They discuss
relationships sometimes and believe
the discussion is of interest to all col-
lege students.

In fact, the same kinds of discus-
sions go on amongsurdents who focus
a little more on the first ﬁve books of
the Bible. ‘-

rm Chicken '

A Earlierthiswinter, RabbiAsher Co-
hen stood before two dozen college
students and challenged them to tiy
a different approach to romantic rela-
tionships. Hewas conductingthe Aish
Leaders Program, atwo—hour-per-week
Jewish studies program offered on col-
lege campuses around the country.
Cohen invited Gila Manolson, an
Orthodox matchmaker from Jerusa-
lem, to offer the Aish students an ap-
proach to dating that is so traditional
that it must be considered radical in

this day and age.

“Let’s talk about love,” Manolson
said. “I love chicken.Ido. Butwhenlsay
that,whatamIreallysaying?I’msaying
that I love the way chicken makes me
feel when I eat it. I don’t love the chick-
en. IfI loved the chicken, Iwouldn’t eat
it. I’d build itahouse inthe back, knit it
sweaters in the winter.”

Manolson meant that often, when
young people get romantically in-
volved, they’re acting on the “experi-
ence principle” — accumulating life
experience through dating. She calls
it “using people.”

Her solution? Instead of the “hor-
mones—heart-head” approach - as she
deﬁnes casual dating reverse it.

No physical contact helps, she
said, which is why thejewish practice

of shomer negiah — not touching .

members of the opposite sex —‘ is so
important. Physical intimacy makes
it hard to see someone clearly, and it
inﬂuences people to focus on less im-
portant things. '

“The next time you say, ‘I love you,’
to someone,” Manolson said, “askyour-
selfwhether what you’re really 
is, ‘I love chicken?’

Prophylactic Prognoses

, Father Kibler and the students
from the oratory echoed Manolson’s
sentiments, albeit with a different
vocabulary and diiferent religious
orientations. They are all campus and
community members who value and
maintain a system of romantic self-
moderation. _

The point-of—view makes sense,
Sartori said, even if God isn’t evidence
enough for someone. Manolson cited
America’s 60 percent divorce rate as
evidencethattoo manymarriages lack
ameaningfulfoundation. The National
CenterforHealth Statistics reports that
the divorce rates for second marriages
is just above 50 percent, but for ﬁrst
marriages it’s closer to 43 percent.

Marriages of people who live to-
gether beforehand are nearly doubly
likely to end in divorce after 10 years,
according to the National Center for
Health Statistics. '

Havingsex, Kibler said, canburden
people by givingthem “disordered de-
sires” or a “darkened intellect” — let-
tirrgreason andjudgmentwithrespect

to a relationship become clouded by
physical  And what people
don’t fear enough, he said, is that such
intimacycandest:royalasting relation-
ship that could have been.

Chastity, for Petrany, is a safeguard
against what Manolson called “using
people.”

“Ifyou give ofyourseli; thenthe rela-
tionshipwill eitherwork or, iﬁt doesn’t,
itwon’tha;vebeenafailure,” he said. “It

Chaste Dating :4 Smooth Sailing

So does cooling-your jets make ro-
mance a relaxing ride?

“No, absolutely not,” Petrany said.
“Oh, man, no.” .

The temptation for physical inti-
macyis diﬂicultto overcomeinany re-
lationship, Petrany said. But even aside
ﬁom that, chaste relationships are as
complicated as any other, for familiar

simple.

“There’s this notion that girls and
guys aren’t allowed to touch each other
and then they’re supposed to get mar-
ried and have ﬁfteen kids, and if they
don’t they’re bad Catholics,” he said.
“None of that is true.”

“Itwould be niceto imagine [. . .] that
chastityunderstood sirnplyinterrns of
abstinence makes for smooth sailin ”
Kibler said. “But it doesn’t mean there
aren’t bumps in the road.”

Pre—marital sex does notguarantee
marital doom, and chastity is not an
automatic ticketto marital bliss. Butfor
Petrany, from whatever one refrains,
action is as important. Relationships
are about self-sacriﬁce.

“Ifa Catholic’s going around telling
you, ‘Don’t have sex before marriage,
everything’ll be butterﬂies and sun-
shine’ . . . that’s not true,” he said. “It
takes work.” .

Asexuality isA-okay

Asexuality 4 15

instinctually, biologically asexual.

This observed behavior intimates that asex-
uality occurs naturally. Applying this logic to
humans would mean that asexuality is a genetic
trait, ratherthan some unnatural consequence
of environmental factors.

The New Scientist also published the results
of a retrospective study on people. In 2004,
Dr. Anthony Bogaert researched the results
of a 1994 survey of 18,000 Britons. Hefound
that about 1 percent of respondents “never felt
sexually attracted to anyone at all.” That ratio
is comparable to the prevalence found in the
rams.

In a 2007 study published by the Kinsey
Institute, Nicole Prause and Cynthia Graham
surveyed avariety of people with different sexu-
alities. She found that self—described 
people were equally male and female, though
they were much older and more likely to have a
college degree. Those respondents listed some
beneﬁts of asexuality as “avoiding the common
problems of intimate relationships” and “less
social pressure to ﬁnd suitable partners.”

They also admitted problems with their

sexuality. Drawbacks included difficulty es-
tablishing asexual relationships, “needing to .

ﬁnd out what problem is causingthe asexuality”
and “negative public perception of asexuality.”
These respondents seem happy intheir lifestyles
but feel that society doesn’t accept them.

With little exception, these beneﬁts and con-
sequences revolve around social norms and
outside inﬂuences. It’s hard for asexual people
to ﬁt in. Thefre apprehensive about messy in-
terpersonal troubles, and some submit to sex

just to make others happy. "

Many asexual people in the studywere still
having sex, despite not wanting to. The study
ﬁnds “nosignificant difference in the lifetime
number of sexual partners reported by asexual
people and non-asexuals.”

A lack of libido, impotence or disinterest in
others could be signs of depression, trauma or
other medical problems. Some respondents
could have mistaken their separate issues for
asexuality. '

However; asexual networks say that asexual-

' ity exists in healthy, functioning people. Asexual- A

. heterosexuality or homosexuality.

ity.org, the website for the Asexuality Visibility
and Education Network, contends that nothing
“went wrong” with asexual people to inhibit
their sexual desires. Skepticism about asexuality
put asexual people in the position of provingan
absolute negative. It is difﬁcult for 1 percent of
the population to maintain that there is nothing
wrong with them when 99 percent of society
doesn’t think like them.

AVEN contributors say that asexuality
is what feels right for them. They are a large
group of 11,000+ asexual people openly talking
about their experiences. We should believe the
asexual people speaking for themselves, even
if science has yet to come up with something
more insightﬁil —— which remains unlikely con-
sidering scientists still can’t deﬁnitively explain

The beneﬁt of AVEN is that it gives young
asexual people support if they discover that sex
isn’t for them. For the few kids orteenagers who
identify as asexual, some will undoubtedly be
mocked or called “gay”—especiallyyoungmen.
This bigotry needs to be addressed separately,
but the idea is derision toward its target. For
young men, sex is a pressurized rite of passage.
To not have it — let alone not want it —— is to
not be a man. .

Like any other prejudice, this is because asex-
ual people “aren’t” something. It’s not that they
are asexual, it’s that they aren’t heterosexual. It’s
the idea of Us vs. Them, with us or against us.

The 19605 inculcated society with the idea
that sex is natural. The Sexual Revolution pushed

decades of Cleaver values. Ewen the Puritans

Sex is natural. Nobody, asexual or otherwise,
would be here without it. But asexuality is as
normal and natural as any other sexuality, if not
quite as common. While upcoming studies begin
researching asexual people, the sexually active
populace need only remain aware that 40 -year-

Honesty, religion and love

Dating and religion 4 17

has only been dating a month and faces hard
realizations about the long run.

“In Islam, a man can marry outside his
religion,” he said. “The child will still be con-
sidered Muslim. Women in Islam have to marry
a man of their same religion?”

She said, “In Judaism, it is the opposite.
The child is Jewish if the mother is.”

Jewish dogma still encourages women to
marry within the faith.

“It’s not negotiable. The man I marry has
to bejewish,” she said.

In the Islamic religion, because people
are born from their “masters,” or parents,
they must seek their permission before mar-
rying. _ .

“My sister went to grad school and met
a Christian guy,” he said, “because she can’t
marry him, he converted for her, but my par-
ents still don’t approve. It’s still a sin.”

The couple, though still together, adrnit—
ted that the relationship probably wouldn’t
work.

David Katz, director of]’Burgh, a program
afﬁliated with Hillel for graduate students and
graduate professionals, encourages a singles-
oriented program but does not advocate using
the program as a dating service.

“If you push a program, it adds a pressure

that’s not necessary,” Katz said. “The program
brings different group of people and showcases
the community.” p I

He said the program exists to help emerg-
ing adults identify with something familiar. Its
intent is not to make matches. Members can do
anything from volunteer to play softball.

Katz believesJ’Burgh-is successful because
it provides a space where members can ﬁnd out
what their faith means to themselves.

“N 0 one is telling them what to think. They
are ﬁguring it out,” he said.

John Wallace, pastor of the Bible Center
Church of God in Christ in Homewood and Pitt
social work professor, advocates same—faith
marriage but agrees with Katz that pushing
people to go in one direction is the wrong ap-
proach. ‘

People who have things in common are
more likely to succeed, he said. A common
faith is just one variable.

“Limiting it to just faith is too simplistic,”
Wallace said. “Major differences about life and
priorities, raising children, parenting, pets
produce conﬂictsaffect a relationship. Faith
is one, but not the only one.”

If people are honest about who they are,
Wallace said, they will know what’s good for
them. ' A I I

    

 

The snuggle— sutra

Snuggling < 10

implies some sense of protection, with an under-
currentofromanticism—prettystraightforward
stuff.

The Teaspoon

This is a reversal of the last position in which
the woman swaddles her petite man in just the
cutest way. He’s so adorable, yes he is. She snuggles
up to his precious frame, delicately stroking his
silky, ﬂaxen locks while he purrs himselfto sleep.
Good night, sweet prince. You’ve got a big day
ahead ofyou. ’

The Amputee

The spooning process has its risks. The Am-
putee happens when the spoonerwakes up inthe
middle of the night andthinks hehas lostanarm.
Whenanarmis curled beneath someone, its blood
ﬂow can get cut ofﬁ causingthe armto fall asleep.
With the spooner unconscious, theusualpins and
needles pass by. l

The spooner doesrftwake up until the arm is
withoutfeeling entirely. Atthis point, the spooner
must use their other armfor desperate succor.

The functioning arm grabs the sleeping ap-

pendage andthoists it into theair,ﬂailingthe limb V ’
inapitiful cryforsensoryperception. Itisahorrify-

ing, graceless procedure. Hopefully itis too darkfor
your partner to see the shame on your face.

Shelob’s Web

Other dangers with limb misplacement ap-
pear in Shelob’s Web. This position results when
bunkmates tangle their appendages in a twisted
mockery of comfort. Therearetwo reasons forthis.

" Thepartners———lovebugs,really——genuinelycan—

not get close enoughtoeach other, so th_eylinI<legs
and knottheirarrnstightly. Or, the sleepers might
have gottentoo drunkand passed outbefore their
pants came off. They fell asleep mid—grope, with
theirbodies stillkinkedinwhateverbawdyactthey
thoughtwas a good idea at the time.

The Cuckold V
_ Here, the man sleeps alone. His adulterous
wife is out at a strobe—lit oxygen bar. sweating all

over some young stallion who resembles Michael

Phelps. For The Cuckold, the man doesn’t neces-
sarily sleep in his bed. He may substitute a couch,
so longashe passes outwithhisXbox36O running
and an open container of sour cream and onion
clip on the ﬂoor.

The Captain Willard

This positionis reservedfor\/ietruamveterans
or other  who arehaunted byﬂashbacks
every night, Theirvalor earned them commenda-
tions for awhile, but now they suffer from post-
traumatic stress disorder.‘

They are constantly torn from sleep through-
out the night, thinking they are still in a foxhole
somewhere.

It can become dangerous for their partners.
The aﬂliction canbe alleviated if the government
seriously funded Tricare, the Department ofVet-
eran Affairs and other veterans’ services.

Though apparently that moneyisbetter spent

on Sen. Richard Shelby’s pork-barrel projects. A

They’re important enoughfor himto single-hand-
edlyhold hostage militarypromotionstonational
security posts, so why not military beneﬁts, too?
Keepﬁghtingthe goodﬁght, senator! Letus know
how you sleep at night.

Conclusion ,

The most important lesson here is to ﬁnd a
compatible sleeping partner. Warn your mate of
your nocuimal idiosyncrasies, and try new posi-
tions to accommodate theirs.

Many. of these positions are gender-neutral,
and even the seemingly heterosexual positions
can be applied to same—sex sleep. However, there
is one big shortcoming. ‘ V

All of these positions are built for only two
sleepers. Butwe only have so much space, so here’s
the deal. Findthis article on pittnews.com, and add

" acomment detailing sleeping positions for three

or more people. I
Thewinnerwill get credibilityforeven-knowing
what that’s like.

‘You’recoming out to everyone  ’

Coming out 4 21

decided it was time. We had spent the day col-
lege hunting in North Carolina and my mother
had been dropping subtleties like, ‘I do_n’t think
this campus is diverse enough for you,’ without
acknowledgingthe bigpink elephantinthe room.
That night [wewere atarestaurant] andldecided
to come outvia knock—l<nock j oke: ‘Who’s there?’
‘Homo.’ ‘Homo who — oh!’ My mom said ‘It’s about
time’ and whipped out a guide to gay—friendly
colleges she had bought for me months prior,”
Murrian said.

“Honestly, that was that, my parents have
never made a big deal of my sexuality at all .. . I
haven’t either. Iknow so many gay guys and girls
around my age who let their sexuality deﬁne
them, probably because they’ve struggled with
it more than I have,” Murrian said.

Not everyone isas luckyas Murrian, interms «—

of immediate parental acceptance.Jacl<ie Fields,
a senior at Pitt, remembers the moment she
told her mother that she was a lesbian during

\_ Thanksgivingbreak her freshman year.

“Iwas in her bedroomwhile shewasfolding
clothes and I juststarted hysterically crying. Iwas
just like, ‘I have totalkto you about this, it’s really
important.’ I told her that this was something
beautiful and I ﬁnally felt grounded for the ﬁrst
time. And she just kind of shrugged it off,” Fields
said. “She wouldn’t look at me the whole time.
She told me thatlwashaving identity issues. She
said that she didn’twant me in that lifestyle andI
thought shewasbeingab*tch, but she just really
didn’t want me to have to struggle.” I
Fields ﬁrst came out at a Rainbow Alliance
meeting early in her freshman year. “That was
the ﬁrsttimelhad ever eventhought abouttalk—
ing about it. This slewyof emotions came out.

It was so great to actually talk about it. Having
that ﬁrst jumping off pointwas really important
for me, coming from a Catholic high school of
all girls. Rainbow was what I looked forward to
every week-. It was like being with 90 of your
closest frien .” .

Many people think coming out is a one—time
event, but Fields emphasizes that, “it’s deﬁnitely
aprocess. You don’tjustcome out. You’re coming

to actin certain situations inwhich maybe you’re
not going to be accep .”

So what does Fields adviseto those struggling
with the decision to come out?

“Reach out as much as you possibly can. It’s
only a secret if you don’t tell anyone. It’s only a
burden if you let it be a burden. It can be free-
ing, it can be beautiﬁil. It’s not about sex. It’s not
about going to seedy dive bars. It’s about maybe

The do’s and don’ts of cell phones and sweet talk  

Sexting < 9

Make it simple, ask for a lunch or
dinner date and leave it till then
and for God’s sake, don’t go on
about normalities in your day.
“Man, that bio test was hard,”

- is for Twitter, you narcissistic

d*ck.

Make sure to text like you talk
and no novels: Keep it under one
message or 140 characters, and
avoid the <3 until a more deter-
mined relationship has been es-

tablished.

Texting follows a relationship
until it ends. While an increase
in lol’s, exclamation points and
“less than three” hearts often
manifests itself as the weeks go
on, texting in relationships can
take various different paths.

It might even lead to a dead
end in one of the countless hor-
ror stories of text—message break-
ups. Guys, girls, everyone in be-

tween — let’s leave it here. Just
don’t do it. It’s insulting.

In the other direction, though,
sexting seems to be all the rage.
Last year, sexting scandals re-
vealed how boys and girls as
young as 14 were sending back
and forth dirty pictures of each
other’s naked bodies. But it’s
not limited to grade school —
sexting is being adapted by all

kinds of people. There’s even‘

an app for it on the iPhone: The
Safe Sexting app lets you take a
picture of yourself, put bars on
yournaughty bits and blur out
your face. A

What we have here, in my opin-
ion, is a trend toward informal
communication. Go back before
phones, Internet and Thomas
Edison. Relationships were de-
fined by either in—person com-
munication or personal, formal,

hand—written letters. You worry
about the days, weeks, or even
months in between responses and
phrase your words as carefully as
possible. With text messages, you
only have to wait a few seconds
and write a few syllables.

And the best part: If you don’t
get a text back within ten min-
utes, it means you get to go back
out that night and do it all over
again.
