Fraternities prepared to crack down on drinking

By Peter Knezevich
For The Pitt News

Pitt Greeks are reacting to penalties lev-
eled on a Carnegie Mellon University fra-
ternity last week.

In the wake of the death of 19-year-old
Justin Chambers at a Pi Lambda Phi party,
Pitt fraternity members are prepared to

crack down on rule violators and underage-

drinkers.

Vice President of Programs and Public
Relations for the Interfraternity Council,
Chris Fedeli, spoke out regarding the inci-
dent.

“I think its effects have been felt all over
the Greek system,” said Fedeli. “People
have to be careful, there really is no second
chance with the Greeks anymore.”

The reactions were sparked by CMU’s
decision to charge four Pi Lambda Phi
brothers with furnishing alcohol to a minor
and, subsequently, a decision to evict Pi
Lambda Phi from its campus fraternity
house.

Leon Haley, vice chancellor of student
and public affairs at Pitt, has had two meet-
ings with the Pitt Greeks since he took
ofﬁce. He said the university is revamping
its rules concerning the Greeks and their
social policies.

“We have in place some social policies
concerning Greeks,” said Haley. “But we
are currently reviewing them right now.”

Haley also said he thinks the fraternities
at Pitt have been acting responsively and
have been respecting the code of law.

“Without a doubt it’s a case where people

4 . . . v . . . . . . - v - ~ o - < . - c w - ¢ - o o o - - - u - « . ~

have to look out for each other,” said
Fedeli. “It’s creating a new awareness.”
The awareness has certainly been felt at
fraternity parties on campus. Underage
drinkers seeking to gain access to fraternity
parties are stamped at the door and there
are signs posted outside the houses stating
that underage drinking is prohibited.
Stephanie Mescall, public relations chair
for the Panhellenic Association, said frater-
nities are taking many precautions
“The precautions taken by the fraternities
are good, they are there to protect the fra-
ternities but also the-students as well,” said
Mescall. “Attention at the door is very
good, every person that gets in signs in.”
The harsh penalties imposed by CMU
have followed two alcohol-related deaths,

VATICAN CITY — The
Vatican announced there was
no dissent within the church
concerning the Vatican’s ban
on women in the priesthood.

This announcement came
after Italian newspapers
reported that Bishop Karl
Lehmann of Mainz, head of
the German Bishops confer-
ence, said the ban on women
may be viewed as a negative
view towards women.

Apparently, the papers
viewed his comments as a
challenge to the Vatican’s ban
on women in the church.

Bishop Lehmann released a
statement to the press stating
the comments that he made
were in no way to challenge
the church’s position on
women in the priesthood but
were his own opinion. —

Rejection Can Be Damaging

To Your Heart

The break-up of a love
relationship can be one of the
most disruptive and upsetting
things that can happen to a

 

not worth living anymore and
often a complete cessation of
any academic work that
requires concentrated effort.
This state of disbelief, confu-
sion and panic may last for
several days or several
weeks.

This time period is usually
followed by a period of
intense anger. There are feel-

create emotional havoc in an
individual’s life, and the per-
son suffering the loss some-
times goes through stages of
grief as intense as if the loved
one had died. _
Initially there is a period of
shock and disbelief and per-
haps appeals to the rejecting
partner to reconsider. In this
early stage there may also be
uncontrollable crying spells,
fear of losing one’s sanity,

difficulty with sleeping and

eating, thoughts that life is

ing person. Then, as the rage
begins to subside, depressed
feelings may occur. The dis-
traught person may withdraw
from friends, become less
communicative, and perhaps
go through a period of self-
doubt about his or her own
self-worth. Frequently, there
is also the terrifying feeling
that the loneliness, the pain
and the unhappiness will go
on forever.

Fortunately, it doesn’t.

Gregris said finding a bio-
chemical marker for suicide
would help make sense out of
a family member’s suicide.

David Lewis, professor of
psychiatry in neuroscience,
has one of the protocols at
UPMC which examines the
brain tissue of suicide victims.
He specializes in detecting the
manner in which schizophre-
nia affects the brain and makes
a person more prone to sui-
cide.

According to Lewis, another
doctor specializes in examin-
ing suicide in adolescents and
young adults.

“The relationship with the
coroner’s office is very impor-
tant for this research,” Lewis
said.

Most students gradually begin to find
the strength within themselves to recov-
er. Some do it on their own or with the
help of friends, and many‘ seek out a
professional counselor or a trusted
member of the clergy to help them
through the crisis. As their coping skills
kick in, they beginto find new people to
do things with and new activities to ﬁll
the void in their lives. Eventually they
are able to let go of the old relationship
and while the pain may linger for quite
some time, they- are able to appreciate
new relationships and ﬁnd other things
that give meaning to their lives.

One thing that all people who are suf-
fering this kind of emotional loss need
to know is that many other people have
gone through this experience and sur-
vived. In fact, it’s the rare person who
gets through life without having his or
her heart broken at least once. As
painful as it is, getting through it is
almost always strengthening. When
you’ve hit the depths and climbed back
out again, you discover coping skills
that can be put to good use for the rest of
your life. At least that’s what I tell
myself as I lick some of my old love
wounds.

Cervenka was in band X with husband John
Doe and is now a poet with published poetry
and has written a book on the Gulf War from
an alternative point of view. She also has spo-
ken word albums and still performs some
music.

Lunch was in the band Teenage Jesus and
The Jerks in 1976 and made an album called
“Hysterie” that chronicles a 10-year period of
her life from 1976 to 1986.

Lunch said she is not afraid to say what she
feels.

“I tell the truth as I see it, in an aggressive
and female fashion,” she said in a Feb. 2 arti-
cle of The Vox, which previewed her show.

The show was done with both Lunch and
Cervenka reading their stuff alternately. Their
poetry is not for the weak-hearted. The crowd
cheered as Lunch proclaimed, “The curse on
Eve was Adam.”

But the part of the evening that received the
most laughs and applause was the O.J.
Simpson commentary in which Lunch claims
that O.J. is “absolutely 100 percent guilty.”

Then she went on to give the audience sug-
gestions about how the problem could have

But then it was enough about Simpson and

with the hot topic of the day, as is most of their
other stuff, starting with welfare reform.

Cervenka and Lunch shouted that the gov-
ernment wants to keep people down and on
welfare and poor so that they have a scapegoat
to/blame for their problems to which the
crowd cheered and reared with laughter.

Lunch and Cervenka had an easy answer for
welfare reform.

“Before we reform welfare we need to raise
the minimum wage to $12 an hour,” she said.

But it wasn’t long before welfare was not .

the subject of choice and it was on to recent
news topics — former U.S Surgeon General
Jocelyn Elders and Dr. Henry Foster, her pos-
sible replacement.

Cervenka talked about the resignation of
Elders because she suggested teaching mastur-

bation in school. Then‘ Lunch asked if they .

taught masturbation at Pitt and made a gesture
similar to a male masturbating. Then Cervenka
said Foster’s appointment won’t last ﬁve min-
utes because he usedto perform abortions.

amount to approximately $2.6
million, Holland said.

These figures have already
been realized by recommen-
dations made previously by
the Medical Review
Committee, the Benefits and
Welfare Committee and voted
on by Faculty Assembly, and
include dropping the tradition-
al plan and adding Blue
Cross’s Select Blue point of

In addition to those savings,
an additional $1.3 million is
expected to be realized
between Jan. 1 and July 1 of
this year with the dropping of
the original plan and the
decline in rates of Health
America and Keystone,
according to Holland.

Surveys have been sent out
to members of the Faculty

Committee in its decisions
regarding insurance.

A petition sponsored by the

lated to gain support against
any sole insurance provider
option, Holland said.

This issue is to go before
the Benefits and Welfare

scheduled to be given at the

ing on March -14.

Veto lhe veto

The House of Representatives has approved a line-item veto
for the office of the president. This will allow President
Clinton, and all future presidents, to remove parts of certain
bills without actually having to veto the entire bill. Money
vetoed under the line-item provision from appropriations bills
would not be spent until further action was taken by Congress.

This measure has enormous potential for abuse. It will affect
the control of the way‘ the nation spends money, because the
president will have dominant control over what programs
receive money. While this is a measure which is supposed to be
aimed at cutting pork-barrel projects, it essentially is a way for
the president to exercise his whim over legislation.

Representative David R. Obey of Wisconsin was quoted in
The New York Times as saying: “The most fundamental threat
to the long—term liberty of this country lies in the unchecked
use of executive power.” 7

Saying the line-item veto will lead to tyranny is somewhat

alarmist, but the measure is a breakdown in the separation of

powers set forth by the Constitution. Congress is the legislative
branch. It is their job to put forth sound legislation. which will
benefit the country. The president must take the bills or leave
them by either signing or vetoing them.

The president will be able to lord it over the Congress with a
line-item veto. He will be able to threaten individual congress-
men with the possibility of striking items for their district or
items they include in a bill without sending the whole bill back
to the drawing board.

While the clause which allows Congress to take further
action prevents the president from being capricious, neverthe-
less, the president could still stop any future measure which

would include money originally deleted under the line-item .

veto. -
The president could also use it to punish political enemies
and keep allies in line. If he wanted to be particularly bold, this
could apply to regions of the agencies and cities as well as
individuals.

The tying together of money for disparate projects in one
piece of legislation is cited as a reason for a line-item veto.
Yet, making projects interdependent on each other lends itself
to a spirit of compromise. It protects worthy projects from par-
tisan ideology and agendas —— a protection which may become
necessary in the years ahead.

The measure is not expected to pass the Senate, and this
would show that there is-some sense left on Capitol Hill even
after November. But, if by some chance it does, the measure
would still only be a law, and not a change in the Constitution,
The New York Times reported yesterday. Therefore, Congress
may be able to exempt bills from the measure or have the
courts rule it unconstitutional. In this event, it becomes a paper
tiger. Either way, it will only add to this nation’s political woes
and should be left unpassed.

. was going to
i: r e s t r a i n
yself from

, ommenting on
the recent -State
‘of the Union
Address. Really,
I was. But judg-
Columnist ing from some of
Erika the responses to
Kendra the speech, I

have come to the conclusion that

President Clinton has once again
been able to fool a lot of people.
I feel it necessary, then, to clear
some things up.

First, it has been commented
that Clinton was too conciliatory
to the Republican party in his
speech. With the constant com-
plaints about gridlock in govem—
ment, I am shocked that being
conciliatory (no matter who is on
the giving end) could be consid-
ered a bad thing. After the elec-
torate made their opinions
known last November, Mr.
Clinton had better learn to be
even MORE conciliatory if he
hopes to keep his job in ‘96.

Raising the minimum wage
was also a big topic in the
speech. It sounds good, doesn’t
it? I have a minimum wage job
too, and I have since I was -16.
But if the minimum wage is
raised, small businesses will not
be able to afford to provide the
jobs so many of us depend on.
Also, larger businesses may not
want to pay higher wages, so
they can easily choose to cut
back their number of employees
in order to avoid the increased
cost of labor. Either way, jobs
are lost and the effect of raising
the minimum wage is negated.

Welfare reform was an expect-
ed topic, and we were not disap-
pointed. Mr. Clinton’s proposals
for reforming the program were,
I must admit, reasonable and
basically on the right (should I
say correct?) track. He sounded
like a true conservative when he
said a solution needs to be found
for welfare abuse. However,
Clinton has proved time and

  
  

again that he is the farthest thing
from conservative. So we must
wonder, will this be carried out,
or is it another empty campaign
promise?

Mr. Clinton also discussed
combating teenage pregnancy.
The solution, he said, would be
to require teenage mothers to
stay in school, or something else
to that effect. This is not a solu-

tion,- this is a response. Tee‘lr1,a'ge’",.

pregnancy is a crisis which
needs to be attacked at its root
and" prevented, not responded to
after it happens. It has been sug-
gested that finding a solution to
this problem should not be made

. into an issue of morality. Excuse
me? I realize that God is practi- -

cally an illegal topic now, but
teenage pregnancy is a problem
caused by a lack of morality.
Preventing teenage pregnancy is
only going to be achieved by
promoting morality and absti-
nence, notby passing out con-
doms in high schools. Just think
back about two generations,
when teenage pregnancy was
considered taboo. The problem
still existed, to be sure, but not
anywhere near the epidemic pro-
portions we have today.

I am continually amazed that
some people still hang onto the
idea of Universal Coverage
health care. The fact is, if that
were the best plan, it would have
been passed during the two years
of Clinton’s presidency in which
the Democrats had control of
Congress. If the government
were to get its sticky little paws
on America’s health care, the
quality would deteriorate to the
point where it would not be
worth going to the hospital. Why
do people come from all over the
world, including countries which

have socialized medicine, to the

United States for medical treat-_
ment? Because American health
care is the best in. the world, and
has not been corrupted by gov-
ernment handling.

Clinton also discussed his
plans to see that the Brady Bill is

leftin tact. The Brady Bill has
been defended by the argument
that we cannot hope to curb vio-
lence if criminals are armed bet-
ter than police. Let’s consider the
word “criminal” for a minute.
The word itself proves that this
argument is highly illogical. Did
anyone see a flock of drug deal-
ers and gang members swarming
the police stations to turn in their
rre;w1y+r,1-1egar5;iw.¢ap‘9:1si:?.§‘r%t;;.
Criminals do not care‘ about
laws, and the only effect the
Brady Bill had was to disarm cit-
izens who had enough respect
for law to relinquish their
Second Amendment right in
order to comply with the new
law. —

Clinton also included lobby
reform in his speech. This is
absolutely necessary, no one can
deny that, which is why Clinton
chose to include this bit of
Republican policy in his speech.
The fact is, we are very likely to
see lobby reform and campaign
contribution reform some time in
the next two years. But if
Clinton and the Democrats really
wanted that passed, why was it
not suggested when the
Democrats had control of
Congress? (Does Tyson Chicken
ring any bells?)

Finally, Clinton claimed that
during his presidency inﬂation
has dropped for the first time in
years. Why, then, has the interest
rate risen at least seven times
since the 1992 election? The
claim is not supported by the sta-

tistic.

Do not be fooled that
President Clinton has “seen the
light.” He may have glimpsed it
momentarily onpthe night of
Nov. 8, but he threw the lamp
across the room and put the light

out. Since his election in 1992, -

Clinton has proved to be nothing
more than a good politician,
making promises he cannot or
will not keep once elected.

Pure and simple, beyond
any reasonable (and unrea-
sonable for that matter)
doubt, 0.]. Simpson killed
Nicole Brown Simpson and
Ronald Goldman.

If you’ve been sitting on
your recliner, watching the
spin doctor gurus, Johnnie
Cochran and Robert Shapiro
try to convince you other-
wise, let me bring you back
to reality.

Simpson had the opportu-
nity to kill and he had the
motive for killing. Now
granted, that alone does not
make him guilty, but take a
look at the facts.

Simpson had a motive. In

‘the words of Los Angeles

County prosecutor
Christopher Darden, “He
killed for a reason as oldvas
mankind  he killed for jeal-
ousy.”

In 1989 Simpson was
arrested for beating his then-
wife, Nicole Simpson. In
addition, numerous people,
including Brown’s sister,
have come forward and said
0.]. was very possessive of
Nicole and jealous. of anyone
who would date her after
their separation.

Whether or not Nicole and
her friend Goldman were

A more than friends is irrele-

vant. What is relevant is that
apparently, Simpson got jeal-
ous, possessive and violent,
just like his past track record
shows.

Prosecutors introduced a
911 call into the trial last
week that shows this side of
Simpson.

The jury heard a tape of a
desperate 911 call from
Nicole Simpson. They heard
her “sobbing, pleading and
sounding hysterical,” while
in the background of the call
Simpson can be heard
screaming and cursing at her.

An LA police sergeant.
who responded to the call
testified that when he arrived
at the house, the back door
was broken in and Simpson
was “agitated.”

Beyond Simpson’s reasons
for wanting to murder his ex-
wife, there is the trail of evi-
dence he left behind.

The lead prosecutor in the
trial, Marcia Clark, laid out
that_evidence.

°Guilty, page 8

-:-..- ;.,

e’s been
framed,
plain and
simple

’m no
lawyer or
nothing,

but 

With an effort at not being
glib with such a somber topic
like the Simpson trial, it’s
quite apparent that there’s a
third victim in this open-and-
shut case — O.J.

. Anyone with any deductive,
level-headed logic knows that
O.J. has been framed. By who,
I don’t know. But I do know
that the Juice has been tortured
long enough and it’s time for
this nonsense to stop.

Let’s get to the nitty—gritty
of the case:

First off, the so-called clear-
cut motive of jealousy isn’t so
clear. Almost anyone involved
in a relationship has had the
emotion of jealousy. It’s a
common emotion that every-
one experiences. But that’s a
moot point.

Let’s examine the murder
scene for a minute. If O.J. did
kill Nicole Brown Simpson
and Ronald Goldman, then
there would be pools of blood,
not to mention he would be
covered with blood himself.
Instead, there were sporadic
drops of blood laying ‘around,

Columnist
Sean
Duncan

and a little of O.J.’s blood

there, too. That’s a little ﬁshy,
don’t you think, for such a
brutal murder to be so clean?

Umm, the last time I
checked, O.J. was a profes-
sional football player (and a
great one at that), not a profes-
sional assassin. The whole
thing pieces together a little
too neatly.

In the.same breath, if O.J.
did methodically plan and exe-
cute this murder, I doubt high-
ly that he just left a bloody
glove laying around the mur-
der scene. If anyone is going
to kill someone, then incrimi-
nating evidence such as a
bloody glove would be the
first thing one would take care
of. It sounds like a classic case
of someone setting O.J. up.

Furthermore, let’s face it,
Ronald Goldman wasn’t a
skinny" dude, he was a pretty
husky, athletic guy. There’s no
way, in O.J.’s arthritic being,
that he could have knocked
them both out by himself.
There had to be more than one
person doing the killing.

Not to mention that an eye
witness saw four people ﬂee
the murder scene that night.

Gymnast Myers overcomes injuries

By Ed Ziegenfuss
Staff Writer

— For women’s gymnast
Michaelene Myers, the word
quit does not exist in the
English language.

Myers, a junior from
Puyallup, Wash., has been
through numerous injuries
that have hampered her col-
legiate career.

“I want to quit when I
want to,” Myers said. “Not
when my body tells me to.”

Myers came to Pitt after
winning the 1989
Washington state high
school all-around champi-
onship. That accomplish-
ment was in itself anrincred-
ible story because Myers
was competing at the high
school level for the first
time after taking three years
off from competitive club
gymnastics due toburnout.

“High school gymnastics
does not compare to the
club level,” Myers said.
“Club gymnastics is more
competitive.” .

The injury plague began
during Myers’ freshman
season with an avulsion of
the elbow. That injury
required surgery and ended
her season.

Myers came back and
competed in two events, the
balance beam and uneven‘
bars, during her sophomore
season. However, by the end

Men, women track roll at Classic

By Diavail Smith
For The Pitt News

The men’s and women’s
track teams clawed their way
past the competition last week-
end at the Hardee’s Classic in
West Virginia last weekend.‘

“We haven’t even scratched
the surface of what we can do
yet,” coach Steve Lewis said
of the Panthers’ effort.

Although the Panthers
haven’t scratched the surface,
they did smear it a bitwith
great performances from
fourth-year stand-out Dietrich
Jells, who is on his way to
another all-conference season.
Jells set the competition ablaze
in the 55-meter dash with a
second-place finish and a time
of 6.31 seconds. But Jells
wasn’t finished breaking the
tape, he breezed by the compe-
tition in the 200-meter dash
(21.42).

“Dietrich Jells had a fantas-
tic day for us,” coach Lewis
said.

And speaking of fantastic,
the Panthers raced among
themselves in the 400—meter
dash with third—year man
Curtis Anderson hitting the
tape just before J erel Williams,
who came in second, with a
time of 50.06 seconds.

The Panthers did all of this
work with several of their run-

The Pitt News

Wednesday, February 8, 1995

of that season Myers began
to feel pain in her shoulder.
That pain continued into
her junior year and finally it
was determined that Myers
would require surgery for
the second -time. Before the
"shoulder surgery, however,

ners‘ out with the ﬂu. ‘Anthony
Dorsett, Frank Nesko and
Najuma Fletcher had the
weekend off, but it didn’t mat-
ter, the Panthers still knocked
the competition out of the box.

“I’m very satisﬁed with our
performances, but we have
bigger and better things to do,”
coach Lewis said.

Jay Murphy turned in a solid
performance in the 55-meter
hurdles by hitting a time of
7.49 seconds to earn a second-
place finish.

The Panthers have many
weapons, and one of them is
third-year man Mark Bufalini.
He took third in the 1000-
meter run (2:34.2).

And now to pause for the
women’s cause, Staci Suggs
burned the competition in" the
55-meter hurdles by takinga
second place and hitting the
tape with a time of 7.89 sec-
onds.‘Lakeya Smith came in
fourth place.-

Lewis is not afraid of the
team burning out, because he
doesn’t believe that they’ve
peaked yet.

“Burnout is an excuse that
many people use when they
lose,” Lewis said.

“Peaking is a psychological
thing, you’re expected to do
well,” he said.

Zenia Ayrton isn’t
even close to peaking, she

was on cruise control when
she came in third in the 55-
meter dash (7.02).

But the day wasn’t over for
Ayrton.,She helped the Shuttle
Hurdle Relay team of Joetta
Purter, Tonya Mullins and
Megan Ferrara hit on all four
cylinders, taking first place
(32.53).

First-year runner Joetta
Purter was a busy woman
as she also helped another
relay team to a victory.
She, along with teammates
Lakeya Smith, Natasha
Van Reil and Shana Fadis in
the Distance Medley Relay
easily took first place
(12:55.6).

Also, Gennifer Washington
took second in the triple jump
with a jump of 37-6 1/4 and
Tina Mapel wasn’t far behind
taking third.

“Running is attitude,” Lewis
said. _

If that’s so, then the Panthers
have plenty of it Angie Martin
had plenty of attitude when
she hit her second-place time
of 2:55.6 seconds in the 1000-
meter run.

“The competition will be
much better at the Husker
Invitationa1,” Lewis said.

The Panthers will need that
attitude next weekend at
Nebraska in the Nebraska
Invitational.

Forward ‘Varga out for at least 3-5
weeks, may miss rest of season

   

Pitt forward Chad
Varga, who has
missed the last 10
games and was due
to come back, will
miss a minimum
three to five weeks
more.

Varga, a 6—foot-7
sophomore, had torn
cartilage removed
from his wrist dur-
ing surgery on Jan.
9 and has been in a
cast ever since.

After being evalu-
ated last Wednesday
by Pitt's orthopedic
surgeon Dean
Sotereanos,Varga
had his wrist placed
back in another cast
and probably will
miss the rest of the
season.

Before the injury
Varga averaged 11.1

points and 6.7
rebounds in eight
games.

°From page 6

On to the next point. OK, I
don’t know much about O.J.?s
mental capacities, but I do
know when he spoke on tele-
vision and in the movies he
spoke eloquently and intelli-
gently. My point is this: What
bone-head in his right mind
would tell his ex-cop friend, a
couple of days after Nicole
was slain, how ironic that she
was killed because he was
having dreams of killing her.

That’s what O.J. did. Why
would he tell him that if he
was guilty? Uttering the name
Nicole if he was guilty would
be the worse thing he could
ever do.

O.J. ain’t that dumb.

My take on the whole thing

is the mafia set him up
because he owed so much
money from his gambling
debts. The pieces of the puz-
zle fit together way too neat-
ly. The mafia simply left spo-
radic trails of evidence to
incriminate O.J.

O.J. couldn’t have pulled
the murder off, but the mafia
definitely could. .

Regardless, the Juice will
walk. T here’s no way in hell
that all 12 jurors will unani-
mously vote without a ques-
tion of a doubt that he did it.

So say what you must about
one of the NFL greats — O.J.
will be a free man.

“The shoulder surgery
went well,” Myers said.

One week after she
returned from the shoulder
injury and subsequent

surgery, Myers was struck
again. This time it was her
ankle. Over spring break of
that year, Myers had surgery
once again.

“I was wondering if it was
really worth it,” Myers said.
“With my ankle I found a
fine line between stupidity
and stubbornness; I guess
I’m stubborn.”

This past summer Myers
put the three surgeries
behind her and went through
a rigorous training program
fine-tuning the basics and
working on strength and
conditioning.

In Pitt’s first meet of the
year Myers scored a 9.5 on
vault, the highest score of
her collegiate career on this
apparatus.

“I was really nervous,”
Myers said of her come-
back.

As fate would have it,
Myers was injured one
more time this season
while training for the
Rutgers meet back on
Jan. 21. The diagnosis was
a crack in her fibula, the
non-weight bearing bone in
the leg. She was forced to
miss two weeks of competi-
tion.

Myers returned to action
last weekend in the Cat
Classic at the University of
Missouri. She scored a
pair of 9.4s on the beam

and vault competitions.
Myers went to the finals in
the beam and finished in
eighth place with a score of
9.375.

“Its nice to have her
[Myers] back,” Pitt head
coach Debbie Yohman said.

“I’ve been working on
floor and my goal is to com-
pete in three events,” Myers
said. “I’ve been banned
from bars by the doctors.”

Myers, who is tied for
second on Pitt’s all-time top
ten list in the balance beam,
seems eager for the season
to continue.

“Believe it or not, I was
injury-free up until col-
lege,” Myers said. “I just
want to get in there. I’ve
worked too hard to give" up

  Guilty

The Pitt News, Wednesday, February 8, 1995

°From page 6

“[There is] a trail of blood
from Bundy Drive to
Rockingham Avenue and
into the defendants very
bedroom, linked by the
defendant’s white Ford
Bronco,” Clark said.

She added that DNA and
other tests will further prove
that Simpson’s blood was at
the scene, according to
Newsweek.

Not enough evidence yet?

Take away those pieces of
evidence and there is still
the question of why, accord-
ing to LA police, was there
a suitcase full of cash and
his passport in the back of
Simpson’s Ford Bronco the
day of the infamous chase.

Maybe he was leaving the
country.

Hmm. I wonder why? _
And beyond that, there is
the human nature aspect. Go
back to “the chase” and you

might remember a letter
written by Simpson, read on
television by one of his
friends. Some called it a
“suicide” letter.

In that document, he apol-
ogized and said he loved
Nicole. How come he never
said that he didn’t do it? If
you were accused of such a

vicious crime, and you were
innocent, wouldn’t you say
so?

And don’t believe that
garbage about Simpson not
being able to get a fair trial.
Both sides have been play-
ing the race card from day
one, and if anything, the
police and the prosecution
have been more then fair
with Simpson.

For example, the day he
was arrested for the mur-
ders, police called him and
said they would be coming
over around 11 a.m to take
him in. Do you think your
average Joe would be given
special treatment like that?

So basically, what it all
comes down to is guilt or
innocence. Everyone in
America is innocent until
proven guilty, and Simpson
is having his day(s) in court.
But remember, if he’s con-
victed that doesn’t necessar-
ily mean he did it, and if
he’s acquitted, that doesn’t
necessarily mean he’s inno-
cent

But my bet is on guilty.
