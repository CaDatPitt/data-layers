Social Security
Loss Causing

Rush to Apply

By FREDERICK BEERS

Officials here are bracing them-
selves for an onslaught of early-
enrolling incoming freshmen
trying to beat the cutoff date for
receiving Social Security benefits.

Because of cutbacks in the pro-
gram by the Reagan administra-
tion, benefits to students whose
parents are deceased, disabled or
retired will be phased ‘out through
1985.

To be eligible for benefits that
still remain in effect, a student
must be enrolled in a post-
secondary school by May 1 of this
year, in addition to having been
eligible for benefits as of August
1981.

Students already receiving bene-
fits will now receive them only dur-
ing the months they are attending

CAS

Adds
Math
Course

By ‘BILL HESS

The College of Arts and
Sciences Council voted to add a
new course to the math curricu-
lum at its Friday meeting. The
new course, Math 40, will be an
alternative to Computer
Science 7, according to College
of Arts and Sciences Dean Irwin
Schulman.

Math 40, said Schulman,
“will fill the finite math course
prerequisite for advanced
courses.”

A second new course pro-
posal was also discussed at the
meeting, but no decision was
made. The proposed course,
Television Analysis, will be
futher looked into and may be
voted on at the next meeting,
Schulman said.

In other matters, the council
studied the new curriculum
, requirements for tranfer stu-
dents. No definite action on the
requirements will be taken
immediately, said Schulman, so
that council members can
examine the implications of the
new proposals.

“We can’t institute new
requirements overnight, so
they'll have to be phased in over
a couple of years,” Schulman
said.

Since the council has already
decided on the math and writ-
ing requirements for incoming
freshman, these will probably
be the first requirements to be
applied to transfer students.
according to Schulman. How-
ever, he couldn't predict when
the new transfer requirements
would go into effect.

The situation has resulted in a

Joseph Merante, Pitt's director
of admissions and financial aid,
said his office has been “deluged”
with calls from students who want
to know where they stand in regard

to benefits.

Merante said he is advising stu-
dents to set up individua-l appoint-
and
financial aid officers and to “talk to

As mterms rll around, the pressre begins to rise. . .

He noted that many school dis-
tricts are arranging early diplomas
for students because “by that time,
the die is cast whether a student is
good or not.” He also said that
some districts are awarding diplo-
mas only after proof of perfor-
mance in college.

To alleviate some of the confu-
sion caused by the changes a spe-
cial seminar was held Friday for
students, parents and counselors by
the admissions and financial aid
department.

She said her high school doesn't

situation and that each time she

calls the Social Security office, “I.

inaugurated as NYU president
last fall, has accepted the Uni-
versity's invitation.

Brademus assumed the NYU
presidency after representing
Indiana in the House of Repre-
sentatives for 22 years. He was
majority whip for four years in
COI1g'l‘("~.S before he was defeated

Prior to his political expe-
rience, Brademus taught politi-

chairman of this commitee, said
that Pitt's entire faculty was
polled for suggested speakers. A
list of approved speakers,
including those recommended
by the committee, was then
reviewed and submitted to
Chancellor Wesley Posvar for a
final decision.

The speakers list is a continu-
ing one, which is updated
yearly. Quatroche said that the
list includes prominent figures
from the following fields: Arts,

SGB Allocations Decision Wrong, Chairman Says

By LAURIE MACLEOD

The Student Government Board
(SGB) should not have suspended
the 25 percent athletic funding pol-
icy at its last meeting, according to
Allocations Committee Chairman
Bob Colosimo.

Colosimo, who was not present
at the Feb. 5 meeting, said at last
Friday's SGB meeting that the
board can't change budget requests
on first submission, only accept or
reject them.

Board member Spencer Davis
said he thought the policy could be
suspended because of a precedent
set at last week’s meeting when the
board suspended the athletic policy
in order to give the Pitt Hockey
Club money for bus rental.

In presenting the Resident Stu-
dent Association's emergency
request for the "Spring Fling,”
Colosimo said that as a last piece of
business under the old funding
policy, only 40 percent of the event
could be funded.

An RSA representative present at
the meeting said the group has no
other means of producing the other
60 percent, and that this would
leave a “kink” in their budget.

After some discussion, the board
decided to reject the Allocations
Committee’s recommendation of
funding only 40 percent of the
event because of the present lack of
knowledge on waiving policies,
according to SGB member Chip
Roth, who acted as the meeting’s
chairman for the absent SGB presi-
dent Todd DeLuca.

The board accepted sanctions
recommended by‘ the Allocations
Committee for Alpha Phi Omega’s
misuse of funds.

At a hearing on Feb. 4, Alpha
Phi Omega was found guilty of
placing a full-page ad in The Pitt
News, despite a rejection of its
budget modification. Alpha Phi
Omega claimed it used a full-page
ad instead of the four quarter-page
ads originally requested to save the
organization $11.10, but failed to
fully explain the switch in its
budget modification.

The American Chemical Society would
like to inform you of their newly formed
Chemistry Tutoring Service. Because this is
a service, there will be no charge for tutor-

ing. For a list of courses tutored and people

who will be tutoring, please check the dis-

The sanctions accepted by SGB

were:

0 a representative from the Allo-
cations Committee must authorize

the moment the budget is unfrozen
on July I, 1983.

An Alpha Phi Omega represen-
tative said the sanctions were
“excessive”

sible for the ad change.

Colosimo said the allocation
policy does not allow the Commit-
tee direct sanctions toward
individuals.

Board members suggested voting
each sanction separately, but Colo-
simo said the sanctions are “a piece
of business and not to be taken
apart.”

In other business, SGB rejected
the Allocations Committee’s
recommendation to cut $200 for

1 center pieces from the Student
‘ Relations Committee’s emergency

request for the Student Recogni-
tion Dinner.

The board rejected an emergeﬁlciyg

request for $1,461.88 by the Inter-
fraternity Council (IFC) for the

ing request for its sixth show.

 Hearing Begins On Suit
3*Against State Over
Tuition Hike

By LINDA MILLER

Today marks the opening day of
hearings on a class-action suit filed
against the state over a $75 tuition
increase by the Commonwealth
Association of Students on behalf

'7? ‘of 76,000 college students.

Hundreds of angry students
gathered on the campuses of the 14
state-run colleges and in Harris-
burg to protest an increase they
claim is unfair and illegal.

4-.

The tuition increase is designed
to raise $5.7 million towards back
pay for college teachers who were
denied a 4.5 percent raise in 1977.
The state lost its court appeals
three months ago and tacked on
$75 to tuition bills for the spring
semester.

Several students have refused to
pay the extra fee, explaining that
they do not believe that they should
be held liable for something that
happened five years ago.

The Commonwealth Associa-
tion of Students (CAS), a group of
student lobbyists who represent the
76,000 students who attend the 14
institutions, filed the suit claiming
that the increase would force as
many as 1,500 students to drop out
of school.

Just how much support the
Commonwealth Association has
for its suit was evident during last
the Pennsylvania Student Associa-
tion of State Related Universities

weeks protests. The largest protest
was at the Indiana University of
Pennsylvania where some 2,000
students and faculty gathered for a
rally. At Westchester State College,
about 350 students burned tuition
bills and a copy of Governor
Thornburgh’s budget.

The Commonwealth Associa-
tion, however, has not asked or
received support from other state
college student lobbyists such as

(this group is made up of students i

from Pitt, Temple, Penn State and
Lincoln University) and Pitt's
Governmental Relations Commit-
tee.

Chip Roth, a member of both
lobby groups, views the Common-
wealth Association's suit as “not
the most effective way" to deal with
the problem.

“By dragging the state into
court, the Commonwealth Associ-
ation stands a very good chance of
alienating the very people who
pull its purse strings,” Roth said.
“The most effective way of dealing

with legislators is to let them know
that you are willing to work with
them and to build a rapport."

According to Roth, both Pittand
the state-related schools’ lobbyists
made an “ideological break” with
the Commonwealth Association
last spring.

“All three groups are looking for
the same thing-—lower tuition and
increased student aid,” he said.
“But the Commonwealth Associa-
tion has rubbed some of the legisla-
tors the wrong way in the past and
as a result we have received a cold
shoulder."

According to Roth, Common-
wealth Association has taken bus
loads of students to Harrisburg in
the past to rally for such things as
the normalization of marijuana
and to protest tuition hikes.

“Often their public rallies and
protests have detracted from the

fine, professional lobbying efforts “

some Commonwealth Association
members haveachieved," he said.

fall.
Merante told the crowd of about
250 iammed into a Forbes

uad
«lecture hall that whatever tgieir

\ .
(efyaecision, “it should be based on the
I rest of your life.” He said a lot of
students were making decisions ~

based purely on economics.

He warned students that attend-
ing spring term on such short
noticevwould be like “leaving high
school on Friday afternoon and
then attending college on Monday
morning. There are no bells, no
one to tell you what to do,”
Merante said. V

He also told students that “your
priorities have to change” that
there may be no time for the school
play, or spring sports. “You have
to put all those other things aside,”
he said.

He told the crowd that another ,
‘V consideration is the availibility of

other financial aid. “The money's

gone—it’s already been dished out '

for this year,” Merante said.
He noted, however, that two pro-
grams are still available—the Pell

  
 

Grant program and Pennsylvania
Higher Education Assistance
Agency Guaranteed Student
Loans. He urged students who
plan to attend spring term to hurry
because time is running out.
Merante stressed that Pitt must
have a student’s matriculation fee

The current confusion concern-

Stan Priselac, a claims represent-

resulted because “Washington
made it very complicated.” He said
the changes came suddenly and
that the public is only recently
becoming aware of them.

Priselac also claimed that the

media “didn’t elaborate on the

Merante said the situation is eco-

gymnast in United States his-
tory and a three-time world
champion, will be the headline
athlete in the inaugural United
States Professional Gymnastics
Classics at the Civic Arena on
Tuesday, Feb.23, at 7:30 p.m.

The Classic, which consists
of a three-month 42-city tour
and offers $250,000 in prize
money, marks the return to
individual competition for
Thomas, who retired as an ama-
teur when he could not compete
in the 1980 Olympics due to the
United States boycott.

The 25-year old Thomas
became the first American in -16
years to win a gold medal at the
World Championships when
he captured the floor exercise
title in 1978 at Strasbourg,
France. He was the 1979 recip-
ient of the Sullivan Award as
the country’s amateur athlete-
of-the-year. His last individual
amateur competition was the
1980 American Cup Gymnas-
tics Championships at Madison
Square Garden, where he won

Symposium
Offered

“The Wild West: Making ofa
Myth," an all-day symposium
that will explore the unique

with the exhibition “Buffalo
Bill and the Wild West", on Sat-
urday, Feb.27, from 9:30 a.m. to

Theater.

The symposium, designed to
provide framework for viewing
the exhibition, will include lec-
tures and a panel discussion by
five noted authorities on fron-
tier life, its romantic image, and
the degree to which this image

Typing and Wordprocessing Service Caters to Pitt Students 4

By CAROL KROWITZ

You've just been assigned a 25-
page term paper. Before you know
it time has flown and the due date is
near. Usually you use Mary Lou’s
typewriter. But you can’t find Mary
Lou. You hear she left campus-
the pressure of the term was getting
to her and the typewriter is locked
in her apartment.

What do you do? Where do you
go?

Students often find themselves in
situations such as this. At one time
Hillman Library had a typewriter
room where students could pay a
nominal fee for use of a typewriter,

' but the library discontinued this

service. While some students
depend on either their roommate’s
or a friend's typewriter to type their
papers, others use one of the

One such professional typing
service is Marcelle’s Typing and
Wordprocessing Service, located at
1314 Clark Street, Wilkinsburg.
For convenience it offers pick-up
and delivery twice a week at Pitt’s
student union.

Mrs. Marcelle West owns and
operates the professional, full-time
typing and wordprocessin g service.
She caters to college students, par-
ticularly Pitt students. Term pa-
pers, manuscripts, resumes, doc-
toral dissertations-—she and her
staff do it all.

What makes Marcelle’s service so
special is that it specializes in last
minute jobs—no small feat and
certainly something all procrasti-
nators can appreciate. The staff at
Marcelle’s consists of four skilled

They work in shifts, which means
someone is always available.

Students using the service also
get the benefit of a word processor.
This sophisticated piece of
machinery, called an IBM Display
Writer, has a vocabulary capacity
of 50,000. In addition, it is correct
to the letter. One of the Display
Writer's features is a spell button.
Depress it and it runs through your
material highlighting spelling
errors. Material can be added,
deleted or changed. The final pro-
duct is an accurately and expertly
typed and spelled paper.

The average price is $1.50 to $3
per page. This, however, depends
on clarity of work and how soon it
is needed. For work that is techni-

cal, needs research or is statistically

related, the hourly rate is $10 to $15
per hour. Both prices (hourly and
page) are negotiable.

“We realize the value of such a
service,” said West. “We take our
job seriously and always try to be
there to do the best work possible
for our customers. It is fulfilling to
finally hand over a bound disserta-
tion to a doctoral student who has
been working on his paper for sev-

The business is going into its
sixth year, having had its origins in
New York City where West worked
closely with Columbia University

the last two years.

Lies -
And Guides

The recent publication of a guide to colleges caused
a small stink around here the other day when Pitt was
described in the guide as, among other things, having
an undergraduate program " ‘tooeasy for above-average
people and too hard for durnimies’.”

One of the perpetrators of that stink, College of Arts and
Sciences Dean Irwin Schulman, said that the guide, The
New York Times Selective Guide to Colleges, was
“simple-minded” and “very misleading.” The first thing
that the dean’s statements indicate is that he probably
didn't read the guide. If he did, he might have noticed that
quotations such as the one excerpted above are actual
direct quotes from students who attend Pitt.

It wasn't only students who contributed to Pitt’s evalua-
tion; academic and non-academic administrators were
also interviewed, according to the guide. As a matter of
fact, one of The Pitt News’ staff served as a contributor to
the guide, and is listed in the book as such. The point is,
however, that comments in the guide were not invented in
some faceless writer’s imagination with the intentof mak-
ing Pitt look bad. Rather, the evaluation came from
within the university, and was simply put together on a
subjective basis by a professional writer.

Incidentially, Pitt’s evaluation is not as bad as the dean
would have us believe. In fact, there are some very high
compliments paid to Pitt, such as the opening sentence in
the evaluation: “Most people don’t expect a private
corporation-turned-state institution actually to get better,
but that's what happened at the University of Pittsburgh.”

Or the last sentence of the evaluation: “And with tuition
levels down, there's no question that things are looking up
at the University of Pittsburgh.”

Eulogies aside, there are some comments in the evalua-
tion that state exactly what most students have known for
years; the only difference now is that they’ve been
published—-for example: “Unfortunately, faculty
members seem to be more turned on by their research than
by their students, and students say the impersonal side of
Pitt is especially evident in introductory science courses,
where computerized multiple-choice tests are the norm.”

Dean Schulman also states‘ that the guide implies that
“all college students are interested in the same things
socially, such as drinking,” and that it"‘fails to take into
consideration that some students do have other interests.”

Although we might be inclined to think that the dean
was making a relative statement based upon the social
activities of his college days, when sock hops, Hula Hoops
and parity raids were the rage, we don’t think this is the
case. Rather, once again, the dean seemed to have been
remiss in his reading of the evaluation. ,

In the guide, although drinking is mentioned (“Thurs-
day night is bar night”), there is also equal, if not more,
emphasis placed on some of the non-alcoholic activities
Pitt has to offer. For example, the guide refers to Pitt’s
location in» Pittsburgh, a city that “has enough cultural,
corporate, historical, and athletic offerings to keep any
student satisfied for four years.” Reference is also made to
nearby Schenley Park, local ski slopes, and the popularity
of Pitt football and other nationally ranked athletic teams.

Finally, there is the question of the rating system used to
rank a school’s academics, social atmosphere and quality
of life. Schools with a five-star rating excelled in that area,
while those with less than five stars weren't so hot. Pitt
received a three-star rating for academics, and two-stars
each for both social atmosphere and quality of life.

While these are not exactly the most impressive ratings

in the guide when looked at by themselves, it should be .

mentioned that in the West Coast guide, the University of
California at Los Angeles (UCLA) received only three
stars in each category.

Pittsburgh, if you were to base your choice of college
solely on the guide’s evaluation, is not such a wonderful
place to visit, let alone live and to go to school in compared
to other schools. ‘The fact of the matter is, however, that
anyone who selects a college based entirely upon the
guide’s description shouldn't even be in college. With the
increasing costs associated with higher education today,
one would be a fool to take such a narrow-minded
approach to their choice of college.

For this reason, comments‘ critical of the guide coming
from Dean Schulman and others are nothing more than

Must We B

By TIM KEARNEY

Ronald Reagan is a nice guy.
Believe it or not, this is what the
majority of the nation still thinks
although his popularity has been
falling __as of late. Although I can
believe that people may find him a
leader, or dedicated to his ideology,
I can’t believe that he’s a nice guy.
This is the man who_ has been cut-

ting not only welfare, but money ‘

for education, health, public trans-
portation and aid to old and poor
peoplethat would have paid their
heating bills. At the same time
these cuts are taking place, Reagan
is building up not only the mil-
itary, but nuclear and chemical
weapons. There is even a bomber
being built whose life expectancy is
such that in five years it will be

obsolete._ _ _
What is our preoccupation with

the military? Have we sunk to such
a level that the only way we can
influence events in the world is to
use the military option? Secretary
of State Alexander Haig asked that -
if El Salvador is taken over by a
violent minority, who in the region
can feel safe? Haig failed to point
out that the Salvadorian people
wouldn't feel so safe eitheriif ruled
by a violent minority. If the Left is
such a minority, why time and
again is it pointed out that the only
force that is preventing a govern-
ment victory is the people’s sup-
port of the guerrillas? Haig is
constantly referring to the Soviet
U-nion’s Afghan invasion and how
horrible it was, while maintaining
that we have the right to clear our
“backyard” of perceived threats.
It’s not only a question of Cen-
tral America. While the govern-

  

5..

ment cuts money for cultural
activities, the budget for service
bands is larger than the budget for
the National Endowment for the
Arts. While cuts are being made in
subsidized lunches for school
children, admirals and generals eat
subsidized lunches in their respec-
tive lunchrooms. Unemployment
is soaring, so military enlistments
are growing.

Why are we experiencing such a
build-up of the military? The Rus-
sians haven't been able to.invade
Poland, yet for some reason we fear
that they will. It seems to me that a
greater threat to freedom is that the
West Europeans don’t trust our
government's commitment to mil-
itary solutions. The growing neu-
tralism of Europeans is not a
communist plot, as is the case with
anything that doesn’t seem to
adhere to Reagan principles, but it
is a great danger. Until we prove
that we have some answers and
leadership that comes from
another source other than our
physical muscle, the future of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organiza-
tion (NA_TO) framework will be

 

So Mighty?

endangered.

Finally, why are our 18- and 19-
year-olds registering for the draft?
As I understand the justification
for registration, we will experience
a depletion of our military ranks in
the event of some massive military
action somewhere and will there-
fore need more bodies fast. If this is
true, then in the face of such a need
the government will need a larger
pool than the 18- to l9-year-olds. In
World War II, men up to age 45
were registered. Why aren’t we
Called _upon now? Will only the
young suffice in the face of such a
major disaster?

The government claims that
800,000 young men haven't regis-
tered, and they have been given a
grace period after which they will
be prosecuted. If they can be found
in order to be prosecuted, doesn’t
that mean that they're registered
somewhere? Some people are fond
of saying that the young aren’t pre-
pared to perform their patriotic
duty to serve, and the same people
refer to the nation’s response to
WWII. It should be remembered
that they, too, had to be drafted,
and they hadn’t even experienced
the sobering lesson of Vietnam.

Perhaps it is the case that the
Russians have been building up
their military over the past decade.
What they have is a great army and
a society that is a military state. If,
in order to “catch up” and “close
(some) window of vulnerability,”
the United States has to be turned
into a military state, then it’s not
worth it. If we become a military
state to save ourselves from being
“conquered” by a military state,
then let them do it to us. At least
we'll be free a little longer.

Learning to Learn Outside of Class

By ALEX DANENBERG

As the cost of a college education
continues to rise, students owe it to
themselves to investigate educa-
tional benefits beyond the class-
room. .

Although in-class experience is

workshops and other activities that
increase, students’ awareness of a
particular field.

However, as tuition costs con-
tinue to rise, money allocated to
these student organizations con-
tinues to get tighter.

Organizations are expected to
generate revenue for themselves.

This means either charging dues or ‘

the only requirement for mati3\soliciting members for fund-

degree programs, it is only min-
imum preparation for an increas-
ingly competitive business world.
Students in most programs at
Pitt can participate in social or
fraternal clubs, professionally
orientedorganizations and many
other extracurricular activities that
add to a well-rounded education. '
The College of General Studies,
for example, has organizations that
represent students in communica-
tions, psychology, business and
computer science, criminal justice,
economics, and more. These
groups help students get practical
exposure in their respective fields.
Throughout the year, these organi-
zations also provide speakers,

raising projects. Social organiza-
tions may be able to accomplish
these goals with a fund-raiser, but
professionally oriented organiza-

tions rely on other activities such as-

speakers and workshops.

Many students who participate
in the latter budget their time for
practical benefits, however, not for
fund raising.

Students looking for practical
awareness within their university
shouldn’t be required to sell raffle
tickets to get that awareness.

Therefore, it is incumbent that
the university continue to support
student organizations——both mor-
ally and financially.

Students should also take advan-

tage of other out-of-class benefits.
Internships, for example, are a way
of getting academic credit as well as
practical experience.

The job search can also begin at
college with the aid of the Univer-
sity Placement Office. In a survey
taken of Pitt's I979-80 class, 67 per-
cent of those who utilized the
placement service were employed.

Large corporations, smaller
companies and other employers
visit our campus periodically to
interview perspective employees.
The interview experience plays an
important role in rounding one’s
education. Selling yourself is a key
factor in business world survival.

The days when college meant
four years in class, get a degree and
then a guaranteed job are over. job
preparation is now more complex.

As college becomes more impor-
tant to an individual's professional
success, the varieties of education
available. in and out of class also
become more important.

Student Housing

Apartments are available for students who wish to live oft-campus.

The numerical selection process
for Pitt student-housing (Housing/
Residence Hall “Lottery”) which
took place February 1-8, left many
students with a major decision to be
made on where to live next year.

Students who were fortunate
enough to obtain housing must
decide which dorm to reside in,

4 while those on the waiting list can

wait to see if they will obtain housing
or else begin the search for an
apartment.

The Lottery

Problem: How do you fit 4,200
students into 1,188 beds?

That is the problem that plagues
Pitt’s Housing and Food Service
Office every year for nearly nine
months. According to Bob Robin-
son, administrative specialist for the
office, the system that Pitt currently
practices is the most effective.

Unlike most universities around
the country that distribute their
housing on a first come, first serve
basis, Pitt uses a lottery system to
decide which lucky students will be
able to secure a room for the follow-
ing term. A

Pitt has 4,200 residents in 11
separate housing units. According
to Robinson, this year there are
1,888 beds available to continuing
undergraduates: 1,000 beds for

Monica Jones’ tragic death in
January of 1979 ushered in the
current security policies of the
University of Pittsburgh dormi-
_tories. The major changes made

instant furor from students, they
have worked out quite well,
according to the director of the
Office of Residence Life, JoAnne
Woodson.

“With buildings as big as we
have, it's tough to make a policy
that everyone will like. Anytime
you reduce privileges, people will
be unhappy, but it has gone as
well as can be expected,” Wood-
son said. Woodson, whose office
is located in the lobby of Tower
C, handles violations, com-
plaints or anything else related to
campus housing. lt’s a task that
has its headaches.

“Everyday we get the sign-in
sheets for all the dormatories
and we go through them for vio-
lations.” Woodson explained.

if a violation is found, the
offender is marked up and after
numerous warnings, sent in
front of the Judicial Board.

“The problem lies in the fact
that many students tell you their
guest won’t do any damage. But
somebody’s guest does, and we
have to avoid that,” Woodson
explained.

While the changes brought ,

Steve Cyphers, a Resident
Assistant in Brackenridge Hall,
does not like the policy changes.

‘‘It’s stupid, because they’re
infringing on people’s rights,
because of the limits onovernight

changes, agrees.

“They are trying to moralize,
but you can’t moralize on week-
days and let guests in
weekends.”

Woodson disagreed. “If we
were trying to moralize, then we
wouldn’t let any guest in, period.
We're not trying to moralize, but
trying to develop a safe and

enjoyable environment for all.”
Though echoes of complaints
are still heard, the dormitorypol-
icies have gone over fairly well,
according to Woodson.

That and the fact that the
dorms have not had any major
incidents makes Woodson’s life
a lot easier. Complaints or no
complaints.

females and 888 beds for males.
That number is based on the
male/female ratio of current resi-
dent students. 1,500 beds are
already committed to incoming
freshmen and new students on a
first come, first serve basis.

lf a student wants to continue liv-
ing in the dorms, there is a certain
procedure he must follow. The resi-
dent goes to the place where the
lottery is held and fills out a verifica--
tion form.

Males and females then separ-
ately check in with housing oﬁcials
to insure that their names are on the
current roster of resident students.

After the verification card is
dated and initialed, the student goes
to the appropriate bowl to pick a
number. There is a bowl for males
and a bowl for females.

The females who pick numbers
between one and 1,000 will be cer-
tain to get a room next fall. Males
who pick numbers between one and
888 will be insured a room. Students
who pick higher numbers are
placed on a waiting list.

Robinson said that even though a
student may not pick a number in
the “good range,” there is still a
chance he may get a room.

He said that, traditionally, all the
numbers in the “good range” are not
picked during the lottery process.

“If there are 200 numbers in the
good range not picked, for example,

the good range moves up to 1200,”
Robinson said.

He said that the number keeps
rising if the “good range” numbers
are not picked. ln the past, he said,
the number for female residents has
reached 1500. He did not say if that
will happen again this year.

The number is also affected by
student’s deciding to move off-
students deciding to move off-
$100 deposit and application in on
time and other factors, Robinson
said.

The current lottery system is in
its fourth year at Pitt. Prior to that,
the distribution of rooms was done
on a first come, first serve basis.
Robinson, who was an undergradu-
ate at Pitt at the time, said that Pitt's
current way is the best that he
knows of.

In the past, he said, the housing
office would announce the date that
the applications would be distrib-
uted in the resident’s mailboxes. He
said everyone would get an applica-
tion and the first 2,600 students to
submit their applications would get
the rooms. Robinson said this way
was unfair. -

‘‘It was impossible to stuff 4,200
mailboxes at the same time,” he
said. “So whoever got their mail first
would have a better chance.”

He said that sometimes he was
out of town or sick and could not get
to his mailbox to pick up the
application.

The applications on the waiting
list were processed according to the
dates they were filed, so a student
had to be quick in that respect, too,
Robinson said.

Although the actual lottery draw-
ing is over within the period of a
week in January, Robinson said the
whole process will not be completed
until next September. Some of the
students who are on the waiting list
may not know until a few weeks
before school starts in the fall
whether or not they have a room.

Housing Office

Besides that fact, Robinson said
he still thinks this is most effective
way. He said Penn State University
still runs their housing on a first
come, first serve basis.

Robinson‘ said that Pitt’s enroll-
ment of 18,976 undergraduates

‘guises a difficult problem, but tne

lottery system is fair and accuate.

Susan Pecuch is a Pitt senior and
has survivied the lottery system for
three years. The lottery system was
installed when she was a freshman,
and she said she thought it was
“stupid” at first. v

“First come, first serve is tough,
but luck is another thing,” she said.

Through the three years that
Pecuch drew, she said she tried to
take it with a light attitude.

“It’s best if you don’t worry about

"it,” she said. “The numbers do jump
over the summer, so don’t panic.”

Pecuch advises freshman espe-
cially not to worry about the sys-
tem. And she tells older students

»D;vho may be thinking about getting

an apartment to draw anyway
because they might change their
mind. Most of all, "she said not to
dwell on the problem if a “good
range” number is not picked.

“lf people worry about it daily, it’s
hard for them to cope with the rest
of the term,” Pecuch said.

She said one of the hardest parts
for a freshman going through the
lottery is the friction it might cause
with his roomate.

“Sometimes there are hard feel-
ings between roommates if onegets
a good number and the other
doesn't,” she said.

Dorm Choices“

l‘3¥here’s something for everyone

in the residence halls at Pitt. On-
campus housing includes single,
double, triple and quad rooms as
well as suites holding up to 9 people.

Towers A. B. and C (sometimes
called Ajax, Borax and Comet by
Pittsburghers) are probably the
most well-known of the dormitories.
They contain single rooms (primar-
ily in Tower C), double rooms and
lounges converted into triple and
quad rooms. Each tower houses
both males and females, and over
1,500 students live in the Towers
complex.

Popularity has its price, however.
One freshman girl in Tower A finds
nothing agreeable about tower life.

ulous,” she said. “Three elevators
that never work for all these stu-
dents. . .the dripping roofs. . .the
noise level. . .I could go on.”

One ex-tower resident disagrees.
“Since Tower A and B are mostly
undergraduates, it gives -freshmen
the chance to meet other students
who are also iust starting out.”

Holland Hall is another dormitory
that houses many freshman, but it’s
for women only. Holland Hall offers
accommodations for one to four
girls in a room and is currently hold-
ing about 550 residents.

“ like Holland because of its loca-

,” said one junior girl. “it’s close
to classes and to the dining halls.”

She also likes the fact mat the
tight security in Holland makes it
difficult to have unescorted males

on the ﬂoors. _
Lothrop Hall, located just off of
Fifth Avenue on Lothrop Street, is

not only physically distant from the ,

main group of dorms, but also has a
different atmosphere. it is compris-
ed mostly of single rooms and holds
approximately 700 tenants.

Mark Reinhard likes living in a sin-
gle rather than living with a room-
mate. He also likes the food and
atmosphere of the Lothrop cafeteria
better than‘ Towers.

‘‘It’s not so much ‘get 'em'

through’ as in the Towers,” said
Reinhard.

Reinhard prefers the carpeted
ﬂoor and cushioned chairs in the
Lothrop cafeteria over the atmos-
phere. in Towers cafeteria.

Forbes Hall, on Forbes Avenue, is
also located away from the other
dorms. It consists mostly of double-
occupancy rooms and houses
approximately 250 male and female
residents. «

Paula Phillips, a senior who is
spending her third year at Forbes,
feels that the residents there respect
it more than other dormitories on
campus. She also said that the coed
setup has taught her responsibility
and has enabled her to develop
close friendshps with many
members of the opposite sex.

“It’s a more relaxed atmosphere
than anywhere else on campus,”
said Phillips.

Amos Hall houses ten of Pitt's
twelve social sororities. With two
exceptions, each sorority suite

. covers an entire floor. It provides

meeting and housing facilities to so-
rority members. When a sorority
does not have enough members to
occupy all of its living quarters, the
housing office will designate an inde-
pendent to live there.

Residents enjoy the closeness of ’

life in Amos.

.‘‘I like the people I’m living with,”
said Sue Minushkin, Amos resident.
“You don’t have. people running

‘around on your floor.”

Instead of the basic double-
occupancy dorm room, McCor-
mick, Bruce and Brackenridge Halls
are all suite buildings: theyicontain
various members of resident rooms
built around a common kitchen and
bath.

McCormick has everything from
two- to nine-person suites and holds
approximately 164 residents.

“lt’s fairly quiet in comparison to
other dorms,” said one McCormick
resident.

Bruce Hall has basically the same
floor plan in each suite on its eight
resident tloors. The suites hold from
four to eight persons and occupy
floors four through 12. The hall
houses 243 residents.

“l like the suites better than indi-
vidual rooms,” said Bruce Fallick, a
resident of Bruce Hall. “I like a lot of
people around.”

Fallick also like the fact that
Bruce Hall has three elevators-
which are almost always in service.

Brackenridge Hall is planned
slightly different; its suites, which
hold four, five or six persons, are not
all set up the same. Located on
floors three through 12, the suites
hold a total of 220 people.

Kevin McKeown, an RA at Brack-
enridge, thinks “highly of the
dormitory.

“As an RA,” said McKeown, “I
think that Brackenridge is one of the
nicer dorms to live in right now
because of its suite accomoda-'
tions.”

He also feels that the coed setup
in Brackenridge is more realistic.

“When you get an apartment,” he
reasons, “someone is not going to
say ‘you can’t live here cause you’re

3”

a girl and this ﬂoor is for guys.

McKeown says that the vandal-
ism problem of last year has
improved because of better security
in Brackenridge.

Each dormitory has an RA on
each floor (except Amos, which
voted against the use of RAs). Usu-
ally a junior or senior, the RA’s job is
that of general supervisor of his or
her floor.

JoAnn Woodson, director of the
Office of Residence Life, feels that
the RA system is working

‘ excellently. -

“I certainlybelieve that the RAs
are doing a more than adequate
job,” said Woodson.

She cites vandalism as one of the
most consistent problems in the
residence halls. Many times.the ele-

vators are out of order because their
doors have been kicked in or their

wires have been tampered with, ,

says Woodson.

Apartments
vs. Dorms

The following are questions concerning
dorm vs. apartment living answered by two Pitt
students, Roxanne R., who lives in a dorm and
Gail B., who lives in an apartment in South

Oakland.

Q. What is -the biggest advantage to living in a

dorm/ apartment?

Rox R. Living in a dorm mak'es college life
more convenient because you’re closer to

everything.

Gail B. When living in an apartment you have
lots of room and you can come and go as you
please without restrictions.

Q. What is the major disadvantage of living in

a dorm/apartment?

RoxR. I do not like the lottery system. If they
must use that system it should be done earlier
so people know whether they should look-for

apartments or not.

Gail B. Most apartments have no laundry
facilities and there are many home repairs that
students must take care of. ‘

Q. Do you feel you are safe where you reside?

Rox R.
Gail B.

In the dorm, I do not feel threatened
by the possibilities of break-ins. ‘
It takes time to get used to living in an
apartment without security, although it helps
to live on the second floor because it’s harder
for burglars to break in.

itt-Duquesne:Fight Changed It

By AMIN GHOSSEIN

The game had been atypical of
past contests. It had actually been a
well-played basketball game. Both
Pitt and Duquesne were executing

crisply, trading pretty basket for
fﬁetty basket. Both teams had been

shooting over 50 percent from the
field. Pitt and Duquesne? Good
basketball?

That’s like trying to mix oil and
vinegar. Sure, the rivalry has
always been exciting, but it has
rarely produced any textbook
games. A little hatred and a lot of
emotion does that to teams. Turn-
overs, bad shots, cold shooting,
mean looks and enough elbows for
a whole season were the mode of
past Pitt-Duquesne games.

Not this Pitt 69-68 victory—at
least not for a little more than half.

“I thought we played as good a
half of basketball as we’ve played

all year. We can’t play much bet-
ter,” Pitt coach Roy (Ihipman said
of the opening 20 minutes.

The Panthers shot 53.1 percent
from the field in the first half and
led by seven points, 38-31, over a
Duquesne team that had shot 51.7

percent. There were only 12 turn-

overs in the half, Pitt committing
only four. Basketball at its finest
came to a Pitt—Duquesne game, and
then it left—abruptly, violently.

A loose ball, early in the second
half on an attempted steal by the
Dukes guard Andy Sissinni, started
it all. A loose ball at other Pitt-
Duquesne games would be a famil-
iar sight. Maybe that’s what did it.
It hadn't been that kind of game.

But Sissinni and Pitt’s Darrell
Gissendanner changed that.
Scrambling for the ball, they ended
up trying to gouge each other’s eyes
out. Benches emptied, bodies and

blows flew, and Pitt—Duquesne was
once again Pitt-Duquesne.

“I was scared to death after the
fight. It turned the game into a

brawl and against Joey Meyers and 4

Bruce Atkins, that's not what I

wanted it to be.” a wary Chipman -

said.

Gissendanner and Sissinni were

thrown out of the contest, and both
teams were assessed double techni-
cals. Pitt’s Dwayne Wallace missed
both shots, and Duquesne’s Terry
Teachout‘ made both of his. The
war, after a brief 20 minute cease-
fire, was on once again.

Bruce Atkins couldn't have been
happier. The Duke’s center scored
20 second-half points, and ended
with a career—high 29 points.

Atkins was vintage, with left-
and right-handed hook shots
inside, powerful offensive

rebounds and a general willingness
to mix it up with anyone who came

Pitt Invitational a Showcase for the NittanyLions

8y JOHNETTE HOWARD

Fourth-ranked Penn State over-
powered four top-ranked oppo-
nents Friday and Saturday to win
the Pitt men's volleyball
Invitational. '

For the second consecutive year,
the Nittany Lions swept through
pool play undefeated then beat a
top Midwestern team to take the
ti ,. Saturday, Penn State dis-

,. Shed Ball State in the finals, 15-

8, 15-3, in almost identical fashion"
to last year's final match win over
Ohio State. In the two—day tourna-
ment, Penn State droppedjust two
of 14.

The Pitt Panther team, currently
ranked third in the East, had hoped
to make the 16-team tournament’s
final four bracket, but it lost in the
quarterfinals to Manitoba, Cana-
da’s second-ranked team. Before
that, Pitt had lost only to eventual
runner-up Ball State 13-15. 10-15,
in the third round of pool play.

“Manitoba just overpowered us.

it gours, especially their block-
ing," said Pitt coach Ray Reilly.
“We wanted to finish in the top
four so we wouldn’t have had to
meet Manitoba until the
semifinals."

Thir net play was a lot stronger.

Preventing Pitt from that goal
was the loss to 1lth—ranked Ball
State, which received a bye in the
quarterfinals for winning all three
of its pool-play matches. Pitt fin-
ished second behind Ball State in
pool C, forcing the Panthers to
play in the quarterfinals against
Manitoba.

“Maybe it. would've come out
differently if we had beaten Ball
State. Both games were really good
games-—_we always have good
matches with Ball State. We were
actually ahead in both games, but
we just made a couple physical
mistakes,” Reilly said. “We
could’ve done better in both
losses."

In addition to the two losses, Pitt
rolled up three wins in the tourna-
ment. The Panthers easily won
both of Friday‘s matches, against
Indiana of Pennsylvania, 15-1, 15-
1, and Slippery Rock, 15-4, 15-2.
Saturday, Pitt defeated Edinboro,
15-12. 15-13, as Reilly chose to rest
most of his starters in favor of his
second team.

With the Pitt Invitational
behind them, the Panthers con-
tinued their busy holiday weekend

The defending Eastern Cham-
pion Pitt swim team outswam the
Indiana Fightin’ Hoosiers but still
lost the war, 63-46, as all 11 Indiana
divers had superb diving perform-
ances and qualified for Nationals.

Pitt head coach Fred Lewis was
pleased with his swimmers’ extra
efforts as he looks forward to even
faster and tighter scoring during
Eastern NCAA Regionals at Trees
Hall Pool in less than three weeks.

The underdog Pitt team opened
the meet on the note Lewis
wanted—a win in the 400-yard
medley relay. Panthers Ed Bergan,
Sandy Pidgeon, Geoff Emofe and
Rick Carter turned in a time of
3227.7, which moves their relay into
the first-place ranking for Easterns.
Bergan’s opening l00~yard back-
stroke split _of 52.1 lowered his pre-
vious Eastern best time to move
him even further ahead of the No. 2
backstroker in the East.

Although Pitt suffered in the
long-distance events, Lewis was
not upset. Indiana’s legendary
coach, Doc Councilman, was a past
Olympic coach of Mark Spitz and
Don Schollander, so Pitt was pre-
pared to be outclassed in the longer
events.

But Councilman and Indiana
were not quite prepared for Pitt’s
sprinting abilities. Although Indi-
ana won_ the 50-and 100-yard frees-
tyle, it was not without a fight. It
was one-tenth of a second in the
50-yard event and two-tenths in the
100-yard freestyle that put Pitt in
second place both times. Carter
swam well for Pitt, but even the
slightest stumble on a turn can lose
the event. Carter stumbled on all
three-turns in his 100-yard freestyle
swim to finish second.

meet, but still equalled his season’s
best time of 2:07.9.

“He went out just a bit too
slow,” said Lewis, “but he brought
back the last 100 yards like the Pid-
geon who holds the Eastern
record.”

Pidgeon’s time kept him ranked
second to Maryland's Kirk Sanocki
going into Easterns. It was against
Sanocki that Pidgeon set an East-
ern record of 2:04.03 last season.

Pidgeon did win the 200-yard
individual medley at Indiana,
which, along with his part in the
‘winning 400-yard medley relay,

earned him honors as Pitt’s only.

other double winner besides Ber-
gan. Pidgeon, like his senior team-
mate Carter, will be aiming to take
full advantage of his last collegiate
meet with Pitt at Easterns in his
home pool.

Overall, it was an incredible
meet for Pitt, for if diving were not
counted, the Panthers would have
beaten one of the test teams in the
nation 46-45. “It was that extra 10
from everybody,” said
Lewis. “We need this kind of solid
team effort again at Easterns.”

Until then, Lewis will work on
the much finer aspects of his
swimmers’ strokes and strategies.
The best thing now for the team is
to put in high quality workouts,
not quantity. Pitt will be defending
its Eastern title in Trees Hall in a
close meet that should boil down to
Pitt, West Virginia and Maryland,
just as it did last year. -

Advance tickets are already on
sale for NCAA Easterns. The swim-
ming will last three days, Thursday
through Saturday, Mar. 4-6. Preli-
minaries will begin at noon and
finals at approximately 5 p.m.

game at the Pitt Field House.

By MARIE HUFF

Despite being honored prior to
Monday night’s basketball game
against Villanova, four Pitt Lady
Panther seniors left Fitzgerald
Field House a little unhappy. In
the final home game of the season,
Pitt lost a nailbiter to the Villanova
Lady Wildcats, 72-67. The loss
drops Pitt’s record to 14-11 and
puts a damper on their playoff
hopes.

Lady Panthers Lose

It was quite evident in the first
half that the game would go down
to the wire. ‘The lead changed

hands six times, with neither t f_ ‘ «_
able to go on top by more than four

points. Debbie Lewis kept the Lady
Wildcats guessing, scoring on
shots from 15 feet out, or slipping
by the defense for easy lay-ups.

Lewis was able to get her hands
on the ball largely because of the
Lady Panther rebounding game.
In the first twenty minutes, Gail
Aughburns grabbed 10 rebounds
for Pitt, while Jennifer Bruce and
Carol Dugan had five apiece.

The Lady Panther defense had
their hands full with the duo of
"Nancy Bernhardt and Stephanie
Vanderslice. With Bernhardt
swishing shots from the outside
and Vanderslice working the
inside, Villanova was able to stay

one step ahead of the Lady Paﬁ 

thers. A Pitt shot at the buzzer

failed to fall, and Villanova held a

slim 34-32 halftime lead.

In the second half, it appeared as
though the Lady Wildcats were
going to embarrass Pitt. Led by
Vanderslice and Bernhardt, Villa-
nova moved to a 50-39 lead just five
minutes into the second half. The
Lady Wildcats seemed to be con-
tent to exchange baskets, but not
for long. Villanova turned Bern-
hardt loose, and the resultwas their
biggest margin of the night, 66-51.
Eight minutes of play still

‘ remained.

Pitt’s Bruce started a rally in
which Pitt outscored Villanova,
14-2, in the next five minutes. ', 2.
surge was led by reserve freshmen
guards Renee Roma and Becky
Maziarz. Roma hit a pair of
jumpers from the top of the key,
while Maziarz forced turnovers,
blocked a shot, and scored on a 22-
footer. Dugan hit a 22-footer as
well.

Bernhardt ended the Pitt skein
with a lay-up. Then Villanova
effectively stalled, despite the 30
second clock, until time ran out.
Pitt, which had only two team
fouls, could do nothing but foul
the dribbler, which only gave the
ball back to the Lady Wildcats.
Pitt, with five fouls to committ
before Villanova reached the shoot-

ing bonus, could not get the‘l5ﬂ‘._;1‘

back enough in the time

remaining.

It was quite ironic that the Lady
Panthers, who have lost several
games because of foul trouble, lost
this one because they did not have
enough fouls. "

Lewis led the Lady Panthers
with 24 points. Bruce added 14 and
Dugan 10 in the defeat. Aughburns
pulled down 17 rebounds for Pitt,
while Bruce grabbed 12. Bernhardt
led all scorers with 26 points.

Picture Georgia running
back and track star Herschel
Walker—-his blinding speed
and great acceleration not
withstanding—running in the
60-yard dash and finishing a
distant fourth in a six—man
field.

Walker was just one of many
high-caliber speed demons to
wage a losing battle last week-
end in the 75th Diamond jubi-
 lee edition of the prestigious
i Millrose Games at Madison

Square Garden.

As is the ritual, track stars,
former Olympians, potential
Olympians and anyone else
capable of travelling faster than
a speeding bullet, or leaping

over buildings in a single
bound, were invited to
participate.

And once again, world

records fell remarkably fast,
lending credence to NBC com-
mentator Charlie Jones’ des-
cription of the Millrose Games
as “the jewel of /every track
‘ } season.”
 For sortie the Millrose Games
provide track athletes a golden
opportunity to prove in head-
to-head combat that they are the
best in America. And when
world records are shattered, the
fortunate can lay claim as the
greatest in the universe.

But for others, like the
second-ranked Pitt 2-mile relay

Conover, Garland Brown and

prestigious Millrose Games this weekend at New York’s Madison Square Garden.

Terry Gallagher, this year's
meet was a chance to see exactly
how far from the pinnacle they
stand.

They easily devoured all
opponents this year and in the
process broke several Pitt
records. Their invitation to
compete in the Millrose Games
stemmed from a then NCAA-
best clocking of 7:27.7 earlier

this season.

With these credentials, the
Panther 2-mile relay team set
forth for New York to challenge
the other big boys. They found
out just how big they were after
finishing sixth out of eight
entries with a respectable time
of 7:324. Richmond won the
relay in a mind-boggling 7:24.

Panther track coach Mike
Agostinella was “pleased” with
'tt's clocking and said that
it's good enough to qualify for
the upcoming NCAA tourna-
ment.” He was disappointed
because he felt the Panthers
could have won the race.

“We ‘had the lead going into
the final man,” he explained.

“But we fell from first to sixth
in that short period. We just

couldn’t hang on.” _
the sixth-place timsh was

' not a good indication of how

well our runners performed,”
he continued. "We were in the
race all the way, and that’s say-

Psyched Lady Vols
Stun Swimmers

By scorr DELLETT

The Lady Panther swim team’s
82-67 loss Saturday to underdog
Tennessee was, according to Pitt
Coach Dave Belowich, a case of his
team’s prestigious name arriving at
Knoxville in considerably better
shape than his athletes.

The Lady Panthers, boasting
one of the East’s top ranking and a
slew of All American candidates,
have consistently prompted teams
to swim their season’s best times
against Pitt.

“With everyone up to beat us,
this puts us in the hot seat," Belo-
wich said. “But the people (on our
team) understand it. Michigan still
hasn’t swam as fast asthey did
against us and that was in
December. I saw the times for Prin-
ceton since their Pitt meet and they

are much slower than what they \

swam against us.”

Belowich said the loss to Tennes-
see was because of a “combina-
tion” of the 10-hour bus trip the

- Pitt team took to get to the meet

and the Lady Vols being “up” for
the meet.

“We were on the bus for 10 hours
and that takes a lot out of the team.
Give Tennessee credit though, they
really swam well,” Belowich said.

Despite the team’s loss, several
Lady Panthers continued to extend
their already fine seasons. After a
successful two-week tour of Europe
with the U.S. national team,
sophombre Sue Heon returnedto
competition for Pitt by scoring a
double win in the 500-and 1000-
yard freestyle. Heon also combined
with Julie Terrell, Val Murphy
and Amy Jackson to win the 400-
yard freestyle relay in 3:35.62.

Jan Ujevich also was a double
winner, taking first place in the 50-

yard freestyle and the 200-yard
breast stroke. She also took second
in the 400-yard individual medley
with a time of 1:00.43. ,.. 

The Pitt divers, in their final
competition before the AIAW-pre-
qualifying meet, swept both first-
places in the one-and three-meter
diving events. Freshman Yvonne
Johnston won the one-meter event
with a 217 score, while Holly Sluss
took top honors in the three-meter
with a 246.5 score.

Other top finishers for Pitt were:
Terrell, first in the 50-yard but-
terfly; Diana Firth, second in the
50-yard breaststroke; Murphy,
third in the 50-yard breaststroke;
and Nancy Henry, third in the 50-
and 200-yard butterfly.

The Penn State Lady Lions
edged Pitt’s women‘s gymnastics
team Saturday H0.80-139.25.
Although Penn State emerged vic-
torious, the one-point differential
tnay have set the stage for "Lady
Panther Revenge" next month at
the NCAA northeast \\'omen‘s
Gyinnastics Championships at
Pitt.

“I think we're just as good as

_.(Pn§_f‘)(‘I1n State," said Pitt Coach

Donna Sanft. “We weren‘t as hot as
we were last Tuesday (when the
Lady Panthers trounced Slippery
Rock State), but anytime we hit a
139, it’s not a bad meet.”

The Lady Panthers started out,

strong by sweeping all three places
on the vault. Senior Holly Martino
captured first place with a 9.1, fol-
lowed in second place by sopho-
more Karen Martin with a 9.0 and
senior Regina Carson in third with
an 8.9.

Leading the way for Pitt in the
uneven bars was All-America
sophomore Lisa Shirk. Although
Shirk was unable to dismount from

H the apparatus due to an ankle oper-
45- Zftitiii she is still recuperating from,

she tied for second place with an
excellent 9.05 routine.

It was Carson's dominance in
both the balance beam and the
floor exercise that chalked up the
most points for the Lady Panthers.
Her dynamic beam routine earned
an 8.85 score, good enough for a
second place.

Then, Carson with a mixture of
powerful tumbling and almost
flawless dance won the floor exer-
cise with a 9.3 score.

“Regina has a special spark-——an
air of confidence about her when
she competes which isn’t present in
practice," said Sanft.

Martin also won two third-
places on the beam and in the floor
exercise to finish third in the all-
around with a 34.65 score.

.\Iartino tied for second on the
balance beam and ended up with a
fourth—place finish in the all-
around.

Penn State, a team lacking in
depth, would not have managed to
achieve its win without some fine
individual performances. Heidi
Anderson, Penn State’s sole
remaining All-America from last
year, drove the Lady Lions to vic-
tory with three first places in the
uneven bars, balance beam and the
all-around.

The Lady Panthers’ next meet is
Wednesday at Clarion State Col-
lege. Clarion’s score last week was
138, and the Lady Panthers are pre-
paring themselves for a “very close
meet," according to Sanft.

Penn State may have slipped
away with a win last Saturday, but
Pitt is looking forward to next
month, when the Lady Panthers
will challenge the defending East-
ern Champions again at the NCAA
Regionals. As Sanft said, “We’re
going to definitely give Penn State
a run for their money.”

injuries and walked away with a
41-6 victory.

The Nittany Lions, ranked No. 1

in the East, pulled in three pins, a '

forfeit, two majors and four deci-
sions. Pitt's lone victory came at
158 pounds, when Pitt’s Jeff Jelic
pinned ‘Penn State’s Eric Brugel.

At 118 pounds, Lion Carl DeSte-
fanis took an 18-3 lead over
Panther Rich Esswein before end-
ing the match 4:27 into the match
with a pin.

Eric Childs kept the Lions rol-

It was Jelic who grabbed the only

Penn State
Wins Invite

against Eastern Collegiate Volley-
ball League foe Army and visiting
California State-Northridge.

Against Army on Sunday, Reilly
again frequently rested most of his
first team and started two fresh-
men, Adam Crandell and Scott
Jones, along with veterans Mike
Petock, Barry Goldberg and Jim
Grant in the backcourt.

Pitt turned back the Cadets in the
five-game limit, 15-3, 15-3, 13-15,
13-15, and 15-4 to win the match.

Monday night, the Panthers
faced Cal St.-Northridge, the No. 7
team in California, the nation's
hotbed for volleyball. Pitt, forced
to play without starters Bill Knuth,
their All-East middle blocker, and
outside hitter Dan O’Donnell, lost
15-13, 15-13 and 15-12.

Despite his shuffled lineup-
Reilly has also been without the
services of outside hitter Tony Zor-
tea, who is still recovering from
partially torn knee cartilage—the
Panther coach was extremely
pleased with his team’s showing
after the grueling weekend of play.

“The team was pretty fired up
because it was the first time they’ve
ever played a California team. It

«ti  «was something to play for, and we

. inrer..c_om,_ laurldry, , .centroIIy.chea_t_eg  -...rYPI N G__PROFESS1ONN_. ..S.ERV_

really played excellently,” Reilly
said. “We played three tremendous
games.”

The P_i_tt«News, Wednesday, February 17, 1982

Bill Kuth‘:

Bath Knuth and O’Donnell were ,

injured on similar type plays at the
net. Each player came down on
another player’s foot, but the sim-
-ilarity stops there. While Knuth
suffered just a slightly sprained
ankle and should not miss any
action, O’Donnell broke his ankle
and is expected to be out for six to
eight weeks, at least.

Reilly said he is considering red-
shirting O’Donnell, a junior, since
the injury will most likely keep
him out the rest of the season.

Pitt is off for two weeks now
until league conqaetition picks up
in early March. The Panthers are
hoping to move into the No. 2
notch in the ECVL behind
Rutgers-Newark, a perennial
power, by the season’s end.

within three feet of his Herculian
build.
"I hope I never see him again on

the basketball court," Chipman

said.

Atkins and smooth Bill Searles
weren't enough, however. Searles,
who scored 16 points, felt right at
home in the well-played first half.
An admitted finesse player, Searles
burned Pitt for 10 first-half points,
mostly on feathery turnaround
jumpers.

“We could have won the game if
the guards had passed the ball
inside more. With all the substitut-
ing that we did, we never got a flow
going,” Searles said after the game.

Searles’ criticism made it sound
as if it weren’t even a game. After
all, the final was 69-68, Pitt, thanks
to an Andre Williams tip-in, off a
missed Dwayne Wallace jumper
with 30 seconds left.

William’s tip-in culminated a
brilliant offensive game for the

O

     

freshman. Still plagued with pain-
ful tendonitis in his knees, Willi-
ams canned six of seven shots from
the floor and a perfect two-for-two
from the foul line.

"I can hit that turnaround in the
lane everytime. Bruce (Atkins)
wasn't jumping, so when I got the
ball, I just took it up,” Williams
said. .

Pitt, with the win, also took a
hold of the fourth spot in the East-
ern 8 and looks to be in good shape
for a first round home court advan-
tage with three of its final four
games at home.

The first is this Thursday
against Rhode Island, 8-13 and 3-7
in the Eastern 8.

“Their startingfive is as good as
any in the Eastern 8," Chipman
said of the Rams. _

So why all the losses, Rhode
Island coach Claude English?

“We do have a very good starting
five, but our bench is weak. We
tend to fade with the game on the
line,” English said. “Our guards

haven't been handling pressure
well."

Funny, if basketball was a 20 or
30 minute game, then Rhode
Island might be undefeated.
They've lost to No. 10 West Virgi-
nia in overtime and later, by just
two points. They've lost to Pitt by
three points after leading by seven
late in the game. Snakebitten all
year, English has one thing to fall
back on. (A

“We're playing right now for the
tournament. That’s when we’ll
show how good we are.”

Some feel they're as good. as
anyone in the Eastern 8.

Pitt Notes: Starting time for the
Thursday night contest is
8:05. . .Marc Upshaw leads the
Rams and is the top scorer in the
Eastern 8 with a’ 20-point aver-
age. . .With every assist, Pitt’s
Dwayne Wallace breaks his own
all-time record . . . Pitt’s Andre Wil-
liams was named‘ Eastern 8 rookie
of the week.
