City of Pittsburgh fire investi-
gators have determinedthat a
fire at a Pitt-owned building used
for student housing was deliber-
ately set. ,

The one-alarm fire, which
occurred Wednesday around
ll:00 a.m. at 305 Atwood St.,
started in the basement storage
area when two mattresses were
ignited by either a cigarette light-
er or a match, according to Pitts-
burgh fire captain Thomas

_ Hitching, who said that the
investigation has been turned
over to city police.

Occupants 1 were evacuated
from the three-story building
and no injuries were reported.
When fire officials re-'-entered the
building, acting battalion chief
Roy Pelkey pointed out several
possible ﬁre code violations,‘

-I including broken lire exit signs,
broken door knobsand faulty
smoke detectors.

“The smoke detectors didn’t
go off," Pelkey said. However,
when later tested, the smoke
alarms did work, leading Pelkey
to ask if the building mainte-
nance personnel were “playing
games with the batteries.” Pelkey
also questioned whether a miss-
ing door knob had been repaired
immediately after the fire.

“One knob -has been fixed
since we’ve been here," Pelkey
said. “The knob was broken
when I got here and now it's been
fixed. I've got enough witnesses
to show that I wasn’t having hal-
lucinations. Either they work
real fast or they're playing games
with us." '

The university’s Office of
Property Management, which
operates the building and more

than 15 others, denied those
allegations.

Property management direc-
tor Charles . Graham asked,
“How could someone replace a
door knob during the course of
the_fire? We did get a list of things

A one-alarm fire broke out Wednesday in this basement.

we should attend to, but that was
after the fire. We attended to all
of them immediately.”

When contacted later, Pelkey
refused further comment, saying
the matter was in the hands of
inspectors. One Pittsburgh fire-
fighter said that Pelkey would
not have called in fire inspectors
unless there were violations. The
firefighter also said that violators

are usually given—a 30-day grace
period to correct any violations.
The inspector assigned to the
case was unavailable for
comment.
One tenant said she com-
pla'ned to property mana ement

about security problems in the
building, including vandals

ments in the basement. I

Graham -said that he was not
aware of security problems or of
any ﬁre code violations until 7
after the fire. He added that both
campus and city police have been
alerted to the security problems
in the building.

 Parkway Construction    
Promises Headachesee"

By was cornea

Pitt vice-chancellor Jay Roling
said last night there is a possibility
that class schedules may have to be
changed due to. the traffic conges-
tion expected during the upcoming
work on the Parkway East, which
will cause Oakland to become the
major detour for parkway traffic.

The project will include the clos-
ing of a portion of the parkway
beginning at Bates Street, west-
bound toward Pittsburgh. At the
same time; otherjmajor arteries all
over the Pittsburgh area, such as the
Boulevard of the Allies, will also be
closed, making Oakland a central
point of passage to downtown Pitts-
burgh, according to Roling. He also
said that the Port Authority is con-

sidering altering ‘ bus ‘routes "around

60's Style Teach-Ins Returning

By MARTY WILLIS

In response to U.S. military in-
volvement around the world, con-
cerned faculty and staff will be
holding “teach-ins” to discuss the
,recent events in Lebanon and
Grenada.

A group of Pitt faculty members
will hold a teach-in on Wednesday,
Nov. 2, from noon to 2 p.m. in the
Kurtzman Room of the William Pitt
Union. c

The teach-in, entitled “The Crisis
in Lebanon and Grenada: Implica-
tions for Peace and Stability,” will
focus on U.S. military involvement
in the Middle East as well as in the
Caribbean region, according to Pro-

‘ fessor John Beverley of Pitt's His-

panic languages and literature
department. g

A number of Pitt faculty members
were already concerned about the
situation in Lebanon before this
week, Beverley said, but the invasion
of Grenada sparked the decision to
hold the event. A teach-in is essen-
tially a public forum in a university
setting in which teachers and spe-
cialists come together to discuss
some issue of overriding national
importance.

The purpose of the event is to raise
the level of public knowledge about
the events leading to both crises and
about the U.S. government’s foreign
policies, Pitt economics professor
David Houston said. He empha-
sized that there will be an open dis-
cussion between speakers and that
the university community is invited

I to participate. I

“I think that it's a problem for

Americans to decide: What is the

role of our government around the
world? Are we the world's police-
men? Is it proper for us to invade
sovereign nations because we see fit?

Is there a foreign policy or is it just .

what [U.S. officials] wake up and
decide to do?” Houston said, citing
some of the “very seriousquestions”
on which the teach-in will focus.

“What’s really on our minds,"
Beverley said, “is that it's precisely
these kinds of things that, in the
past, have held the danger for larger-
scale military escalations. We’re in a
really dangerous moment right now,
and it’s important that people be as
informed as possible so they know
what the stakes are."' A

Houston‘ suggested other correc-
tions Americans should make.
“What’s the relationship between

turned its attention to international
concerns at yesterday’s meeting
when board member Jeff Delmon-
tagne asked the SGB to endorse a
petition calling for‘the “complete
and immediate” withdrawalof U.S.
troops from Lebanon and Grenada.
. “We, the Student Government
Board, should make a decision
whether we are going to let them
continue on the path which led to
Vietnam,” Delmontagne said.

He said the issue concerns the

board “since we’re all of age.” The

petition will be to U.S. Senators
Heinz and Specter.

SGB President Mark Downs

.requested that Delmontagne present

the petition in writing for the board
members before they decide whether
or not to endorse it. .

Three emergency requests were
voted on at the meeting, and once
again, the question of whether or not
to fund the Writers’ Conference was
brought before the board.

“In essence, you’re saying that any
special interest group that has'cer-
tain needs can come to theboard
and ask us [for funding],” said Steve
Smith, chairman of the Allocations
Committee, who recommended not
to fund the conference.

’The committee decided. that the
Writers’ Conference is like a conven-.

‘By MICHAEL WEINMAN

A Midwest researcher isicalling
upon college students to engage in
political activism and change tax
codes to ensure their employment
upon graduation.

Students" should use their
numbers and votes to bring about
new tax legislation, according to
researcher Charles Youngblood,
president of the Full Employment
Association (F EA).

Pittsburgh hasrecently been cited
as a model city in creative tax legisla-
tion by FEA. The city, according to
Youngblood, is now using a tax sys-
tem simila‘r to what he calls Reduced
Taxes on Improvements (RTI).

- The FEA is a non-profit corpora-
tion headquartered in Provo, Utah.

According to Youngblood, the aim.

of the FEA is to “carry the message
to America on the success of RTI
domestically and abroad” in the
hopes of initiating similar legislation
nationwide.

The RTI program has been oper-
ating in Pittsburgh since 1912,
Youngblood said, and involves dif-
ferent tax bases for property and
improvements to the property.
According to the RTI proposal,
taxes on improvements should be
based on the land’s potential value,
not neccessarily on its current usage.

The FEA, he said, does not hold
that the government can or should
guarantee jobs.

“The past 100 years of socialist
experiments proved that,” Young-
blood said in a telephone interview.
“What we want is that the govern-
ment not impede our constitutional
right to a job.” The F EA. he added.
believes these impediments originate

through unfair tax basing.

One of the biggest problems cities
face in modernization is known as
the “prisoner’s dilemma," Young-
blood explained. According to this
theory, if any one land owner’s
improvement of his property results
in an increase in tax assessments on
all parties, then no one will improve
his property, thus assuring low taxes
— even if this also means no
development.

Under the RTI system, taxes
would not increase as rapidly as

“What we want
is...our constitu-
tional right to a
job."

Charles Youngblood

under most current systems. Since

RTI taxesare also based on a per-
centage of the number of improved
properties, Youngblood said, taxes
actually are reduced on each piece of
land. This practice avoids the “pri-
soner’s dilemma” which has plagued
cities such as New York City and
Los Angeles. ' _ _

Another successful user _of the
RTI tax system, according to
Youngblood, is Australia. The Aus-
tralian government provided the
nation with a forecasting of what
they thought the new taxes would be
under the RTI system. Evidently

The Pitt News, Friday, October 28, i983

A Students Urged To Change Tax.Codea

pleased with the results, Australians
put into effect the new tax method.

Youngblood and the FEA believe
that the current tax system being
used in most areas is illegal because
it violates the Fourteenth Amend-
ment to the Constitution. The FEA
interprets the “pursuit of happiness"
clause to be invalidated if one can't
be employed, and they associate cur-
rent land tax laws as hindering busi-
ness activity. Youngblood credits
Pittsburgh’s use. of the new tax sys-
tem with attracting 167 companies
(85 from abroad) to move their U.S.

corporate headquarters to Pitts-,

burgh. Youngblood feels that even
though Pittsburgh is suffering
greatly from steel layoffs, the impact
would have been devastating with-
out these corporate moves.

“Only those landowners who
stand to profit from land speculators
have come out against Reduced
Taxes on Improvements,” Young-
blood said. “.

Youngblood "sees this program as
providing a meeting ground for
businesses and employees. Through
RTI, Youngblood sees businesses
getting the tax incentives to improve
the downtown centers and enhanc-
ing economic activity through
increased employment, thus enhanc-
ing sales and income. ‘

Critics of RTI have called it ideal-
istic and have accused it of catering
to the high technology and executive
areas of growth. They cite Pitts-
burgh as a prime failure of RTI, say-
ing. that the only real winners in
Pittsburgh’s Renaissance II have
been the corporate executives that
have relocated here, saving the com-
panies money, but not providing

' increased employment.

SGB Addresses International Concern

continued from page one
row, the issue will go directly tothe
board next week. ._

The board voted. 4-1, with Stram
as the dissenting vote, to accept the
Allocation Committee’s recommen-
dation, again falling short of a
majority . -

Smith said he objected to funding
the concert because it is a duplica-
tion of Pitt Program Council events
and it is against board policy to fund
off-campus concerts (the Jazz
Seminar will be held‘ in Carnegie
Music Hall).

Stram said the board already has
a commitment to the Jazz Seminar,
since they gave the group a vote of
confidence at a prior SGB meeting.

Part of a request was met —.but
part turned down — when the board
unanimouslyivoted to give $411.50
to the Black “Action Society for a
“get acquainted” weekend.

The BAS had requested $646.20,
but the board ‘heard “two stories
which don't even pertain on both
sides” about why extra funding was
needed, Smith said. -

To date, all news on the invasion, the casualties
suffered by both sides and the evacuation of American

been a mix of statements from Pentagon spokesmen
and the sketchy notes of reporters gleaning what they

the action. .

Opinion

Midterm Blues

By MIKE ELLIOT can concentrate more fully on it.
The next afternoon, after you
have crawled out of bed, shaved
your tongue, and ingested mas-
sive doses of aspirin, you are
ready t’o start thinking about
studying. Not actually studying
mind you, just thinking about
studying. After a good 15 min-
utes of this, you are ready for the
next phase: going back to bed to
sleep off your hangover.

When you wake up the next
day, you are ready to begin mak-
ing preparations for studying.
First, you must clear off your
desk. After all, how can you
study on a cluttered desk? Then,
you go to the store and buy some
munchies — you can work up
quite an appetite studying. With
this accomplished, it is time to
get all of your notes together and
organize them on your desk, in
case you might want tostudy

- later. By now, with all of these
study preparations completed’,
and the thought of studying
firmly in your mind, you are
uptight again.

Back to Zelda’s for happy
hour; and as long as you are
there, you might as well make a
night of it —- you can always look
at your notes a couple of minutes
before class tomorrow anyway.
There you have it — a sure- fire
way to stop those Midterm
Blues.

Once again, we find ourselves
trying to prepare for midterms.
Unfortunately, most of us do not
seem to budget our study time
appropriately and as a result,
become very tense and frustrated
during these times, an affliction
known as the “Midterm Blues.”
However, if we budget our time
appropriately and reserve some
time for study breaks, we need
not ever suffer from the Midterm
Blues again.

Since most of us have several
exams at a time, we must first
divide our time equally among
the exams we are studying for.
The rest of our time should be
filled with pleasurable activities,
which help take our minds off of
the impending exams.

When developing a schedule
such as this, you must first decide
how many days you need to
study for the exams. In my own
experience, I find two days to be
a sufficient amount of time._

A typical schedule would start
by blowing off all of your classes
— after all, who can pay atten- ‘
tion in class when he is worried
about midterms? Then you get
all of your friends together and
go bar-hopping until the bars
close — this helps to relieve all of
those pre-exam jitters, so that
when you do start studying, you

In Defense of Philly

a natural and exciting rivalry
between two great cities. Phila-
delphia, as well as our own town,
has had a lot to cheer about in the
last decade, including world
championships and division and
conference titles.

Dear Editor: I

After reading Mr. Marra’s
opinion of Philadelphia and its
sports teams on Oct. 19, I must "
write in response to defend my
place of birth. Granted, I have
lived in Pittsburgh for 10 years
now and I do condsider myselfa
dedicated Pittsburgher, but I still
feel a certain loyalty to Philly
and its teams. The recent World
Series was depressing, but I
wouldn’t say that the Phils were
“whipped like dogs,” as Mr.
Marra states. On the contrary,
four of the five games were very
close and considered exciting
baseball by purists of the game.
Also, one five-game series
doesn't disprove an entire month
of excellent baseball that pro-
pelled the Phils to the National
League Championship.

I guess Mr. Marra is-just upset
that almost every year he finds‘ a
Philly team in the finals of some
sport and must root against
them. I hope he was in Happy
Valley last May when the ’76ers
crushed the Lakers for the world
championship. He probably
wasn’t, though, since his decision
was already made to attend our
finer educational institution.

Save your energy, Mr. Marra,
and stop rooting against Philly
teams because they’ll always be
there. Put more energy into root-
ing for Pittsburgh teams. Let’s go
Pitt, Steelers, Pens, Bucs . . . and,
let’s go Philadelphia sports

I must state that Philadelphi-
teams ll!

ans do not hate Pittsburgh teams
as Mr. Marra suggests. Rather,

Why Israel Exports Arms

Dear Editor:

I read with great interest the letter
submitted by Dana Reed on Oct. 26.
He presents very clear evidence to
prove that Israel sells weaponry to
some Latin American governments,
however repressive these govern-
ments may be. Without sounding
like one ‘of the “apologists" whom
Mr. Reed so obviously pitiies, I
would like to shed some further light
on Israel’s arms transfer policy.

Israel is a country in need of for-
eign currency. Foreign debt has
always been a problem, and exports
are the best way towards generating
income to meet the demands ofcred-
itors. Thecommodity with the most
international demand is armaments.
Exporting arms not. only generates
national income but also makes the
production of weapons for domestic
defense a more economical burden.
Israel’s fixed costs inherent in the
production of weaponry remain rel-
atively constant irrespective of their
export policies. This argument has
frequently been made to justify the
sale of. United States weapons
a-broad.

A distinction should be made
between the sale of arms for eco-
T urposes and t_he_grant of

 

arms for political purposes. The
United States, as we all know, gives
military aid to basically the same
countries as to whom Israel sells
weapons. The difference is the
American desire to exert political
influence.

Israel’s political posture in Latin
America has consistently been one
of support for American policy. As
Mr. Reed is certainly aware, the pro-
ponderance of evidence suggests
that the United States has actively
encouraged Israel to act as an arms
broker in Latin -America. Specifi-
cally, in countries such as Guatem-
ala where the American transfer of
arms was disallowed, the Reagan
administration has requested that
Israel take action where the United
States cannot become directly
involved. It is unsurprising that
Israel cooperates, given the impor-
tance of good relations with the Uni-
ted States to Israeli policy.

It is also no surprise that Israel
chooses to do business with Latin
American rightist governments.
Pariah states such as Israel are
unlikely to be concerned by world
opinion which is already against
them. In the eyes of Israeli decision
makers, the'Latin governments ot
the left are no better than those of
the right.

 

Most important is the absence in
Mr. Reed’s argument of any evi-
dence that a halt in Israeli arms sales
will effect any improvement in the
status quo. It is obvious to me that
an end to such shipments will have
no effect on the ability of Latin dic-
tators to suppress their citizens. This
seems to be Mr. Reed's true concern,
and his argument does nothing to
solve this problem. He must be
aware that ‘the arms transfer policies
of South Korea, Taiwan, France
and Brazil come very close to that of
Israel. One supplier would simply be
replaced by another.

In sum, Mr. Reed’s argument
rests on his belief that Israel’s arms

transfer policy is lacking in morality.

On this point, we are in near agree-
ment. But that doesn’t mean that
Israel should be singled out for hav-
ing a foreign policy unconcerned
with moral questions. In fact, the
larger culprit in the affairs of Latin
America is the United States. When
Mr. Reed can name us one country,
other than Switzerland, which
adheres to his standards, then we
can get back to criticizing Israel.
Until then, let Mr. Reed vent his
frustration over this imperfect world
elsewhere.

Computer Hours Extended  

By ERIK SCHWER

The computer center has
recently made‘ a number of
changes to help alleviate ‘the
overcrowding problems at the
Remote Job Entry (RJE) sites. .
Among the steps taken were:
extended hours for three RJE
sites and the addition of a new
VAX computer.

The addition of the VAX
ll/780 computer in July for the
fall term was done on an experi-
mental basis to determine
whether it could lighten the load
of the Dec-Systems A and B. The
new machine, designated
UCCVAXI, is currently being
used for the instruction of three
information science courses and
one industrial engineering
course, totalling approximately
300 students, according to John
Martin in a report for the Uni-
versity Computer Center’s Pitt
Programming Notes. The VAX
system can be accessed by 20
public terminals at Old Engi-
neering Hall as well as through

But The

‘The Right Moves’

By LISA LAVALLE

If I had all the right moves, I never

would have found myself at a movie“

which is a hybrid of Flashdance and
Monday Night Football (minus Howard
Cosell). Once again, we are treated to
a familiar Western Pennsylvania

scene, Johnstown, to be precise, but '

the similarities, unfortunately, don't
end there. This is a movie filled with
hard-hatted steelworkers, blue-collar

heroics, ethnicity,and of course, Iron ‘

City Beer.

All The Right Moves stars Tom
Cruise as Stef, a senior football
player at Ampipe High (fictional).
Stef has a clear set of goals: he hopes
to land an athletic scholarship and
study engineering. The way Stef sees
it, scholarship is his only alternative
to life in the grimy mills of John-
stown, and he is almost obsessive
about attaining one. -

Stef's goals are put in jeopardy

when a misunderstanding arises with
Nickerson and he is kicked off the
team. It seems that the coach doesn't
appreciate Stef's "bad attitude," espe-
cially when the recruiters are making
their rounds. -In short, Stef gets
blacklisted. Many other dismal situa-
tions are dumped into Stef's story.
His close friend, an equally-talented

athlete, turns down his scholarship to J

stay in Johnstown and marry his
pregnant girlfriend. (It's quite odd
that the couple visit Pittsburgh to
confirm the -pregnancy; don't they
have doctors in Johnstown?) Stef's
girlfriend, Lisa (Lea Thompson), a sax
player in Ampipe's band, would also

like the opportunity to go to college-

but can't afford it. Scholarships aren't
as easily available to musicians, she

complains, so (we assume), she'll stay
in Johnstown and be miserable for
the rest of her life.

All the Right Moves attempts to make
a meaningful examination of the eco-
nomic and sociological , condictions

that shape the lives of teenagers A
trapped in a dying steel town. How- it

ever, the movie is extremely elemen-
tary, and it fails to delve beneath‘ the
surface of aTV-movie plotline.

The movie was written by Michael
Kane and directed by Michael Chap-
man, an Oscar-nominated cinemato-
grapher; Chapman never should

Yet another film director has failed‘
to capture the spellbinding aura sur- .

rounding a Stepen King novel. David
Cronenberg was definitely not in the
right zone when he directed King's
The Dead Zone.

In the past, King has provided us
with a rabid St. Bernard, a woman
covered in pig's blood, a knife—happy
psychopath and a demon—possessed
Plymouth Fury. What is most unique
about King is that he takes the seem-
ingly ordinary,” safe situation or
object and twists it into a biiarre,
blood-chilling nightmare

The current King creation is the
character of Johnny Smith (with a
name like that, how much more ordi-
nary can he _get.7). Johnny has an acci-
dent and is plunged into a coma for
five years. Upon waking, he finds his
mother (Jackie Burroughs) has
become a religious fanatic, his father

PITT   PR

All The Right Movesfails terribly
because it is done with an alarming
lack of sensitivity and integrity,
because the characters are poorly-
scripted and, as if. this weren't
enough, because the performances
are dreadful.

The most disappointing effort
comes from Tom Cruise. This is not-
ably disturbing, for, before this film's
release, I considered him to be one of
the most talented young leading men
in Hollywood. Likewise, for Lea
Thompson,'whose portrayal of the
nice girl-next—door is too sickeningly

' sweet to be believable. The’ girl is dull,

(Sean Sullivan) has drastically aged
and his fiance (Brook Adams) is mar-

ried with a young son. Now the twist

— as a result of being in the coma,
Johnny has been accursed with a
power‘ which allows him, by merely
touching someone, to see that per-

son's past, present or future. The

visions, however, are nearly always
tragic happenings. And Johnny, pos-
sessing this power, discovers that he
is able to alter the future.

A (major problem with the film is
the sloppy transitions; often, espe-
cially during the first 15 minutes, the
film uses ”fade to black” to signify a
scene change. Instead of the scenes
flowing together" smoothly, they
seem to have been pieced together in
choppy fragments.

Also, the total time it takes to show
Johnny's initial accident and his
awakening five years later is a scant
five minutes. This isn't to say that his
comatose period should have been

but just long enough to foreshadow
the intended suspense and to allow
the other characters to show We some
emotional sustance. ‘

That brings us to another major

flaw, and one which is present in a  I

ters are not developed enough for the . f

FREEZE FRAME

Aztec

Frame Muses About  

Music  

Story By_Frank DiGiacomo

At first glance, Aztec Camera’s

Roddy Frame hardly resembles a

rock musician. -In fact, a second
glance confirms the first: he's a kid; a
bright-eyed, innocent-looking pixie
who, with his shy-boy mannerisms
and thick Scottish dialect, ‘looks
more like a grandmother-charmer

. gigolo than a pop star.

However, first impressions ‘are
unfounded, and while Frame exudes
a boyish, charm, anyone conversing
with. him for even a short while
quickly learns that his adolescent
frame also houses a shockingly keen

. intellect and a complementary sense

of articulation —— especially for
someone who's only 19 years old.
Intellectually, Frame is no youngs-
ter, but he is still a strange sight sit-
ting at a table in Heaven's dressing
room with his tousled page-boy hair-
cut and his freckled, coltish face
brandishing an unlit cigarette. Aztec
Camera has just finished their set at
the nightclub, and one half-expects
Frame’s mother to barrel up at any
moment to tell him that it was a mar-
velous show but that he shouldn't
smoke. However, some youthful

‘spark in the singer's eyes quickly dis-

pels any notion that he would need
his mum or anyone else to tell him
what to do.‘

Frame is a product of East Kilbride,
Scotland, where he has spent most of

A the 19 years of his life. At age 16, he

left school because he found it ridicu- I

lous and traded ‘academia for music.
Around 1979, when Britain was mis-

carrying the infant ‘punk scene,
Frame was forming Aztec Camera, a
band that, with its acoustic guitar
trappings, did not seem to fit into the
violent thrashings of the time peri-
od's musical products. Nonetheless,
the group was signed to the Scottish
Postcard label where it released sev-
eral singles that met with mixed
response. It was .not until the
summer of 1983 and the band's debut
album release, High Land, Hard Rain,
that Aztec Camera began to turn
heads. Ironically, the group's largely
acoustic sound still did not fit in with
the current glut of syntho-pop, but
this time, Aztec Camera and Roddy
Frame were deemed the critics’
darlings and a refreshing relief from
the coldness of synthesized
songsmanship.

The band's name seems to reveal
something of its nature -— a meeting
of the old (Aztec) with the modern
(Camera), but Frame tends to dismiss
this symbolism. He says, instead,
that Aztec Camera’s title arose from
the imagery of the pretension that
was around in 1979 and 1980 when
most every other band was ‘adopting
psychedelic nomenclature like The
Teardrop Explodes and Echo 8: The
Bunnymen. In this light, Aztec
Camera fits right in. "It's really quite
pretentious,” he admits "but I don't
think it really means that much. I
wouldn't care if you came to see us as
Band Number 2450 or something —
as long as you can identify us with
something.”

‘ Photos By Martha Rial

That "something," Aztec Camera’s
calling card, is a big acoustic guitar
sound that conjures up references to
Buffalo Springfield, Neil Young and
even some Joy Division (bands that
also happen tobe some of Frame’s
major influences). It is a musical
style that hearkens back to the folkie
school of thought and seems to be a
modern attempt to fall back on the
twang of tradition. However, Frame
does not see Aztec Camera as dou-
bling back to find its style. "You can't
go back to traditionalism," he
explains. "Traditionalism is some-
thing which is constant. I just want
to be seen in the light of tradition —
as part of it. Just like Chuck Berry,
Captain Beefheart, Neil Young and
even Duran Duran are seen as part of
it." _ e .
Frame also sees his Scottish back-

ground as a subtle but inherent,

influence in his songwriting and
ultimately Aztec Camera’s style. "I
think I flaunt with it a bit, and
obviously, it invariably affects cer-
tain lyrics," he says smiling with the
unlit cigarette still hanging from his
mouth. "If you come from the same
town as me, then you may have even
a deeper understanding of the lyrics
than you would if you came from
somewhere else. It's the same scene
as literature." ‘

One more universal aspect of

Frame’s music is a bittersweet sad--

ness that seems to permeate the
majority of Aztec Camera’s songs
and lyrics. RockBiII Magazine quoted

I.

5“ him as saying "That’s what makes

Camera’s Roddy  

‘<
"Fl

good art .— sadness.” While he admits
that he "must have been drunk"
when he said that, he does agree that
there is a kernel of truth in the state-
ment. "I think what I meant was that
I'm very optimistic, but I'm.also very
cynical. I believe that's the tradi-
tional recipe for romanticism," he ‘
says. "That is the flavor — what the
romantic poets are writing about.”

Frame maintains that a good song
can be totally positive, and he points
to "The Back Door to Heaven,” one of
his newest compositions, as a prime
example. "I do feel the need, how-
ever, to point out, in songs, things I
don't like as well — things that affect
me in a sad way,” he says, reiterating
his original point. "I get really disap-
pointed when I see things being com-
pletely mediocre.”

According to Frame, mediocrity
runs amok in this world and has
spread its average tendrils to taint
"95 percent of America and every '
other country I've been to." He sees
its presence in social structure and
today's youth, butstrangely enough,
not the record industry. Instead,
Frame sees the music business as -an
opportunity to be heard —— a chance
to display his wares for the listening
public} _ s ,

"The one thing about the music
industry I that's most ‘important is
that it's a business that sells music,
just like the washing machine indus-
try sells washing machines. There's
no. point in pretending it's not, or
trying to say that it shouldn't be," he
says. "I want to make records, and I
want to "have stupid lackeys with

beards taking them out to shops and

giving people free T-shirts and
things because that's what every
other band does. I wouldn't be able to
come and play here if it weren't for
ideas like that, so I want to use them
to the best of my ability."

While he feels the promotional
system can work for Aztec Camera,
Frame has a much different opinion
of how the record business measures
success. "I hate the idea of accomp-
lishment in the music industry and
the way it's treated like a sport,_
whereby, if you're number one then
your record is much better than the
one that's number two,” he says,
finally lighting the now-chewed
cigarette. "If your record doesn't get
in the charts, then it's not as good as
someone's who does. What I want to
do is make sure my record company

-_ gets kicked up the ass enough to

think that I'm as important as a Neil
Young or a Talking Head, and I think
they're starting to treat-me like that.

It's a good record — they bought it, so '

they should promote it whether it's
number one or not."

Another person who also feels that
High Land, Hard Rain is an exceptional
album is Elvis Costello, who has
made it clear in several interviews
that Aztec Camera is his choice for
best new band of 1983. The press and
the group's public relations people

Costello's comment into the prover-
bial ground. Frame realizes the mar-
ketability of such a statement, but he
also believes that Elvis was not mak-
ing small talk. "He was totally sin-
cere," he stresses, finishing his

_cigarette and snatching another from

the -pack (this one, he lights right
away). "I don't know — Ijust want to
get people out to see me. Once
they're there, they can decide

~ whether I'm some shithead that Elvis

Costello was trying to promote, or
whether I've actually got something”
to say. So get'em along. Tell them
that my stage is paved with gold. I
just want to play to people — I want
people to see me so that they can
reach their own conclusions. It's not
my fault if the promotions are taste-

less, and it's not Elvis’ fault either."
For someone who has such a realis-
tic grasp of music industry mechan-
‘ics, Frame is much more
romantically inclined when it comes
to his music. He says that music has
always been something he could turn
to for a positive feeling, and that
indeed, it does hold a certain magic
for him. "I just think that music and
lyricism are mystical in a way — it's
always been that way since I was
young. However, I don't think that

you should encourage the idea that ’

only special people can play guitars

,. because anyone can play the guitar ‘—
‘’ some people just take longer than-

others," he says breaking into a sly

‘he's some sort of child prodigy, but

then, any 19 year-old who. hates
Holden Caufield ("He's a fucking
adolescent moron,” he says of the
Salinger character) but loves Dos-
toevski would never admit to such
an idea. Instead, Frame hints that his
wisdom is a product of keeping him-
self inspired. "There’s a stage in life
when you're very open and forming,

ibut most people stop developing

when they're 21,” he says. ”I don't
think I will; I never have. Ijust keep
finding new things to inspire me all
the time. I guess you could say I'm
constantly discovering howlrich is
the tapestry of my life."

Possibly this maturation and

original ‘Aztec Camera the formed
and, consequently,.there is never any
question of his leadership. "I also
think it's much easier to dealvwith
one person as an-energy rather than
trying to organize four people,” he
says, searching for another cigarette
and finding that his box is empty.

”Besides, I know much more about ,

the lyrics, the approach of the band
and the idea behind Aztec Camera’s
being formed —- it's more beneficial
that way.” ’

Any young boy withian acclaimed’

rock-n-roll band is going to have
expectations, and Frame is no differ-
ent. In fact, he is quite intense about
his goals. Moreover, he exhibits this

smile, cigarette and all. A "You don't
have to be particularly talented to be
in a band, do you? Hopefully, though,
there is a mystical thing for others. I
see it in music and even in the world,
but it doesn't mean that I'm a wizard
or anything.”

Perhaps he's not a wizard, but

there is a maturity about Roddy A

Frame and his music that one would

I expect from a'30 year-old Elvis Cos-

tello type, rather than _a 19 year-old
kid. He doesn't necessarily feel that

inspiration that guides Frame is also

what makes him the dominant force '
‘in Aztec Camera. There is no ques- I

tion that he is the leader of this band.
‘At the start of this interview, the
other members seemed to take some
invisible hint and left the room.
Every so often, one would stray by
the conversation as if to make sure
Frame was giving the proper story,
but none of the other group members
ever said a word. He explains that
none of these musicians was in the

quiet sense of optimisticconfidence
that says, one way or the other, his

‘ ambitions will be achieved. Pres-
. ently, Frame is intent on building an

audience for Aztec Camera, and he
says that the band's once-limited cult
audience is ’ beginning to grow.

"We've kept/the art students and the '

hucksters, and now we're getting
their little sisters who come with
their autograph books and their
colorposters — I think that's great,”
he says, still looking for another

 

V I ‘Page _‘l5 
cigarette (A ‘woman in ‘the room:
' ‘gives him one and/lights it f5r _hi'm).’” *

Aztec Camera’s recent popularity

pleases Frame, but he maintains that ’ H 1

it hasn't changed his personality
much. He's aware that many
critically-acclaimed musicians, once
they gain commercial success, are-
accused of losing their essence, how-

. ever, he feels that he's not that sort of A
person. "A while ago, I got a publish--" " ~'

ing advance, and what you're sup-
posed to do with it is spend" it on
cocaine and buy yourself somebody

to love," he says. "So I bought myself ‘.

somebody to love, but I didn’t.know
what do with the rest, so I just
bought people presents. I'll do that
the next time I get an advance too. I_
don't need much for a star, eh?"
Another goal of the young singer’ 5;:

is to keep moving artistically. He‘_ ’

refuses to let his music stagnate, but .
he also plans on keeping Aztec .
Camera’s style recognizable. '’I want
to be able to keep pushing and keeps
changing — like Neil Young," he I
says, contentedly sucking on the gift-'

cigarette. "I don't think I'd be as blat-

ant or as eccentric as him — I'd strive 

/

for more continuity."

Taking this into account, and ever- .

ything else about Roddy Frame -— his ‘
age, his maturity and most of all his '

talent — it's not too hard to envy this
charming little Scottish imp (espe-
cially when the one who's doing the
envying realizes that he's two years ‘

older than Frame and doesn't have L _

halt the insight or the charming
Highland dialect of this artist.)
Somehow, Frame has found a way to
be realistic andlromantic at the same
time. Moreover, he keeps his philos- ,,
ophies simple. There's no guarantee‘
that Roddy Frame will make it in the
music world, but it doesn't seem like
it would bother him that much if he

didn't. Perhaps he sums himself up .

best when he says, "I just like to
make good records and be happy with

what I'm doing. I want to feel that, 5

every time I write a song, I've done
something successful — that I've
done something that's important.to
me and important to people in their’
bedrooms listening to me. When I
stop being happy with it then I'll stop
altogether because I don't have to do
this — I can always sell my guitars to

make. money." I I"  It

- HOW TO SURVIVE YOUR COL-
LEGE DAZE

G. Brown

New View Press

I'm somewhat skeptical of "How

.'To" books after being flooded by a

barrage of how to be everything from
a preppy to a valley girl to an MBA
student, how to flatten your stom-
ach, trim your thighs and on and on
and on... Nevertheless, G. Brown's
How To Survive Your College Daze is a
commendable attempt to help
college-bound high school seniors.
The first part of the book is partic-
ularly relevent. Entitled "Getting
There,” this section lays on the line
everything from finances to loneli-
ness — not to mention a particularly

’ honest section on why college isn't for

everyone. , ,
The rest of the book is a very frank
look at what actually goes on in the
collge scene. "A Giant Slumber
Part"y" tells all you need to know
about the social graces of drugs, sex
fraternities and skiing (not necessar-
ily in that order). "Things like the loss
of your virginity_ occur on their own
timetable. You'll probably be drunk 
and so will your partner.” Strike a
note of familiarity?
Brown also has some particularly
valid hints on ’Staying There": mak-
ing sure not to register for any classes
that start before 11 a.m., owning a
"bright yellow highlighter and break-
ing between study at Tastee-Freeze
or Pizza Hut just a few of the helpful
hints offered.
College Daze doesn't actually encour-

age delinquent behavior, it just lets us -

know everyone ‘elseldoes the same
things we're doing, makes the same

,mistakes and gets just as lonely and

G. Brown bids us a fond farewell
with these few inspiring words: "and

THE BRAIN GAME .
By Rita Aero and Elliot Weiner,
Ph.D. A

Quill

The halves of the human brain con-
trol different sections of the thinking
and reasoning process — the left
hemisphere deals with linear logic
(mathematics, verbal skills, scientific
information); and the right with
space relations and creativity (aes-
thetics, imagination). For years,
scientists have attempted to measure
the output of the brain in numbers
known as the "intelligence quotient/'5

\:\\\\§
\- W

or I.Q. The accuracy and legitimacy
of the testing procedure have always
been suspect, but the field of study
still fascinates. However arbitrary,
measurements in numbers are some-
how comforting.

Rita Aero and Elliot Weiner have
collected "27 Classic Intelligence
Tests" in a volume entitled The Brain
Game, designed as an informal home
study to "Reveal Your Unique Abili-
ties" in terms of art judgment, analyt-
ical skill, general mathematics,
memory recognition, vocabulary,
reading comprehension, matching.
accuracy and more.

The tests are neatly divided among

four subheadings: the left and right
hemispheres; "software," the ability
to synthesize information from both
sides of the brain; and "hardware,”
unlearned, instinctive intelligence.
The spiral-bound Brain Game provides
thorough instructions and tear-out
answer sheets; time limits for the
various tests vary.

A quick flip through the pages re-
veals little to get excited about
initially, but beginning with the preli-
minary 30-minute I.Q. test, the pro-
ject becomes quite engrossing.
Complete analysis of scoring follows
each section, and Aero and Weiner

 

correlate the skills used for the var-
ious tests to possible career options.
The end result yields a sort of do-it-
yourself brain profile, perhaps not
entirely accurate, but still somewhat
‘indicative of strong points. "Someone
who reads a book like The Brain Game
is demonstrating intellectual curios-
ity and that all-important motivation
which is the mark of real intelli-
gence,” explains the preface. Propa-
ganda aside, The Brain Game's concept
of "how-to" teaches and entertains
the reader willing to make ' a
commitment. '

parades, haunted houses andeother

organized activities are growing in

popularity. Mark Walker has put
together The Great Halloween Book, a

_reference and how-to "traveler’s

guide" to the holiday. '

A short history of the evolution of
All Hallow's Eve and trick-or-treat
opens the book. Sections on step-by-

included for the ambitious andlor
skilled partygoer. Walker offers sug- -
gestions for a successful party,‘ a la

ment. Loosely outlined" techniques ’

fo_r__ organizing and operating a

 

haunted house comprise the last
third of the book.

Walker is a semi-professional
magician; but his stunts and gags -
particularly those listed as approp-
riate for adult get-togethers -— do no_t
read as realistic or effective. In terms
of scope and optimism, The Great Hal-

obviously serious in intent. Walker

offers a rather likeable and light—_

THE LIGHT OF THE HOME
By Harvey Green
Pantheon '

Charles Dana Gibson's girl’

sketches seem to embody the prevail-
ing imageiof the perfect and pure
American woman of a century ago -
one with unblemished complexion,
beautiful figure, long and pinned-up
hair and tasteful dress — an image of
wealth and comfort, although not
exactly typical. _

The greater quantity of museum
artifacts from the Victorian period

'(c. 1870-1910)‘ relates more directly

to the "mainstream" middle class
woman. Most of the advice literature
and ladies’ publications were directed

at the average married-with-family g

woman; and existing diaries and let-
ters are products of the same.
Harvey Green, historian at the
Margaret Woodbury Strong
Museum of Victorian America, has
drawn up a portrait of the women of
the era in The Light of the Home —
Women were the center of the
domestic ideal, procreators whose
first obligation belonged to husband

and offspring. The entire intimate

spectrum of the lifestyle is covered in
detail — courtship, marriage, moth-
erhood, fashion, housekeeping,
health, leisure, religion and death.
The routine was rigorous, accord-
ing to strict rules of acceptable behav-
ior shaped by tradition, peers and

‘ such magazines as Godey's Lady's Book

and The Household. "The men and
women of the late nineteenth cen-

tury laidlthe foundation for the build-

ing of modern. American culture," (.1

Green explains; "their concerns,
fea-rs and expectations are very much
our own." ' '

Well-documented with photo-
graphs and footnotes, the text main-
tains interest with matter—of-fact
style. While highly specific in nature,
The Light of the Home provides an intrig-
uing glimpse of the past.

HOW TO PREPARE FOR THE

By Gregor Hartmann

Quill ’

We've all had those alphabet soup .
tests: NEDT, DAT, ACT, SAT —

taking two No. 2 pencils to adrafty 7%

hall early some Saturday morning
and reading the instructions to your-
self while the instructor needlessly
reads them aloud and tells you how to
make proper marks on the computer-
ized answer sheet. And the examples:
"Choose the word most opposite in
meaning to the first." UP — a) dog; b)
table; c) down; d) fork. Obviously "c,"
right? And then the actual test ques-

one; b) isoalloxazine; c) heptachlor; cl) _. .-. '

Yeah, we all know how it is. And ... ‘

we've always known that there's
ample fodder here for a parody of
some sort, certainly. Behold — the
Student Potential Life Achievement
Test, SPLAT for short, "designed to
measure scientifically the verbal and
mathematical skills so important for

success in life." This mock test com-' '

bines the more ludicrous aspects of all

those other tests, and Gregor Hart- ’

,mann has developed How to Prepare for
the S.P.L.A.T., a lightweight approach
to test readiness. ,
The manual has the appearance of
a "real" preparation book from the
outside (Hartmann even has an S/M
degree in education), promising
healthy laughs. But the humor inside
is in short supply. One of the chap-
ters explains "the fine art of taking

dull tests," and the SPLAT might as L,

well include itself in that select group.

"SPLAT scores are also handy for
categorizing people," Hartmann
writes. "The bright student walks
taller because of her 600, while the
unsuspected genius who pulled in a
750 can have it tattooed on her
brow.... Anyone who falls below 500
is certified stupid." Ha ’ha, right?
Hartmann combines puns, non sequi-
turs, pop-culture references and
crude sexual humor with his wry
advice and knowledge of standard-
ized examinations, and the results
ought to be funny. '

THE CHANGING ANATOMY OF
BRITAIN
By Anthony Sampson
Random House

America's overall impression of
Great Britain is somewhat distorted;
after all, we are still the bloody colon-
ials that revolted against King
George III for taxation with repres-
entation. Because both Americans
and Britons speak the same language
(on the surface, anyway), the impulse
is to feel an understanding for the
British society, when in fact the real-
ity is quite different.

Anthony Sampson’s The Changing
Anatomy of Britain explictly addresses
that problem, and furthermore,
makes it comprehensible to Ameri-
cans who may not really have the
perspective to understand the Eng-
lish. In this update of The Anatomy of
Britain (published some 20 years ago),
Sampson paints a hard but fair pic-
ture of what exactly makes Great Bri-
tain tick. British institutions and
their misadventures are related in
full detail —- ranging from the nation-
alized industries such as British Rail
to the powerful financial institutions.
Personalities are drawn in detail as
well, providing extreme insight into
why the British act the way they do
and perhaps, offering an explanation
for the industrial disease that makes
Britain a ' joke among industrial
nations.

With one caution, this book is
extremely well‘ written in the droll
Britsh style. But the caution relates

1 to the droll British style. Anyone who

is not familiar with British English (as
opposed to American English) might
find this book dull and inexcusably
boring. For those interested in pers-
pective, as opposed to mere facts on
the problems Great Britain has faced
in the last'25 years, The Changing Anat-
omy is well worth the time required to
read it.

Bridges. They're common enough
in Pittsburgh. One is different,
though, and it's located on the stage
of, the City Theatre at the corner of

. Sennott and Bouquet streets in Oak-

land where Mark Medoff’s Children Of
A Lesser’ God celebrates City Theatre's
10th anniversary ‘(complete with new

’ seats). A joint production of City

Theatre and the Pittsburgh Deaf
Theatre, Children is a play about com-

'municating. Unfortunately, com-

municating is something it doesn't do
well.

_ Medoff introduces us to James
Leeds (David Louis Jefferson), a

speech therapist at a school for the a
_deaf. It is at this school that Leeds
' becomes enamored of a young deaf-

from-birth pupil, Sarah Norman
(Debbie Krausa). Naturally, as a

relationship with Sarah by trying to
induce her into learning to speak,
something Sarah refuses because she
can't ”do it well.” Leeds’ problem is

By LINDA HENRY

The University of Pittsburgh.

Theatre opened its 1983-84 season
last weekend to alternating spurts of
laughter and gasps of indignation
induced by C.P. Taylor's Good in the
Stephen Foster Memorial Theatre.
The first U.S. performance of the
play since its New York opening, it
was the premiere event in a month-
long festival and conference of Jewish
playwrighting sponsored by the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh Department of
Theatre Arts, the United Jewish Fed-
eration of Greater Pittsburgh and the
National Foundation for Jewish Cul-
ture in New York.

‘Taylor's "play with music," dealing
with the rise of Nazism, is greatly
influenced by the Expressionistic
style of German writers in the early

A part of the century. Although writ-

ten in the late '70s, the play has a
strong sense of unity since it focuses
on a German literature professor,
John Halder, beginning around 1933.

The play takes place in Halder’s

SHOWCASE, Friday, October 23, 1933

that he continues to want Sarah to
speak, though she points out the
effectiveness of American Sign Lan-
guage — her language.

While Leeds and Sarah are going
round and round on this point, others
are starting to notice them, with var-
ying effects. Mr. Franklin (Charles
Altman), the head of the school for
the deaf, looks over the tops of his
eyeglasses at the ethical question
posed by the teacher/Plipil relation-
ship; Orin Dennis (Patrick O'Hara)
sees himself losing a friend and com-
rade in his struggle for deaf rights
with what he perceives to be Sarah's
defection to the world of the hearing;
and a spry and nymphomanical Lydia
(Karen Walkney) becomes jealous,
wanting Leeds to lavish’ his attention
on her rather than Sarah. The out-
come is that they are all watching as

Sarah leaves the school and marries ‘

Leeds. -

Medoff tries to give us everything;
the lighter side, as when Sarah, in an
Italian restaurant, teaches Leeds the
sign for veal, which A translates as

Assaultiml The

mind, and like the mind, jumps from
one thought to another in no particu-
lar sequence of time or space, yet it's
somehow logically connected.
Halder’s specialty as a professor is the

German writer Goethe, and it is by

no accident that Goethe is referred to
often as this play is a reflection of
Faust (Halder as the seeker of -truth
and Hitler in the role of Mephisto—

/ pheles). And by the end of the play,

Halder, a genuinely good man, has
given in to his self-serving pleasures
and is controlled by the forces of Nazi
power. It is a demanding script,
requiring sensitivity in technique and
a_ variety of talent. Director Gillette
A. Elvgren, Jr. has done its justice,
creating a graphic, imaginative show.

Alex Coleman handles the lead role

of John Halder like a skilled magician A

passing from one trick to another
with uninterrupted control. His, all-
American mannerisms and his child-
like struggle with reality gain our
sympathy from the start and keep it
until his final pitiful "moments on
stage, even though by.then' he has

"cow baby”; and the darker side —
Sarah's expository remarks about her
prior method of communicating sex-
ually with ”hearing boys" or, most
notably, Sarah's explosion in the

second act where, because of Leed’s

prompting, she vomits forth a deluge
of incomprehensible "words" as she
speaks for the first time onstage.
Other action takes place, also — the
introduction of an attorney (Lisa
Thompkins) to help Orin in his battle,
the renewed interest in Sarah's
mother (Gay Heit Lavi) after a sepa-
ration of eight years and Lydia’s pro-
fession of love for Leeds — but it is
hard to know how consequential this
peripheral action is supposed to_be. It
is unfocusedand doesn't bring us to
the end of the play-where Leeds, as in
the beginning, contemplates why
Sarah leaves him. ’ ‘
Medoff seemingly has chosen to
elicit response to his play via the sen-
timental manipulation that naturally
occurs when a predominantly hear-
ing audience is exposed to the deaf
experience, rather than by allowing a

  Final Solut

become a rather despicable ‘human
being, making it clear that we are to

question how these events could

have happened.

The only main character who is a
Jew in the script /is Halder’s best
friend, Maurice, played by Pitt new-
comer Mark Douglas-Joiies. It is
through him that Director Elvgren
adds‘ a Christian motif to the play:
Maurice, killed, we are to assume, in a
concentration camp nearthe end of
the play, comes back to life for Halder
in a haunting scene Douglas-Jones
plays with lyrical beauty.

The most pathetic, yet funniest
character of the play is Maria Barney
as Halder’s wife, Helen. Barney plays
this unkempt, desperate "housewife

with such tenderness you cannot -
help but love her. Her choices in por— '

trayal give more strength to Halder’s
conflicts than if she had played Helen
with total apathy. Elena Bertolino is
wonderful as Halder’s nagging
mother and Ann Marie Costa, with
the most expressionisticmake-up job
on stage, handles her dual roles as

response to be gleaned from an
unmuddled and focused, theme.

This production, directed by Marc
Masterson, however, offers a value
not inherent in Medoff’s script.
Movement on the City Theatre's
thrust stage often leaves actors,
while speaking, with their backs to
portions of the audience. While nor-
mally undesirable, one can't help but
notice the audible communication —
the only method,av'ailable to the actor
— and the ramifications of deafness
in a world all too ready to turn its
back. The production serves to
sharpen the awareness of the com-
municatory problems between the
deaf and hearing that compound the
already complicated communication
of human interaction.

Pittsburgh bridges all connect one
side to another and, to a certain

Maas,Panthers Ready“
To Squeeze Orangemen

By MARK A. SINDLER

When people mention buffet line
and Bill Maas in the same breath,
there is reason enough to make sure
the plate is ﬁlled before Pitt’s hulk-
ing defensive tackle meanders
through the various entrees. I

Maas, a 6-5, 265-lb. senior, is the
type who requires a private tailor to
find button-downs accomodating
'2 ough for. a diametrically-large

“’ neck. He possesses the kind of
strength needed to bench-press, say,
the Cathedral of Learning. '

And often in jest, this imposing,
curly-haired pillar of power is called
Bill “Mass,” as in massive.

3 So it is of some unique insight
when Maas, at a luncheon gathering
of media types earlier in the week,
offered a comment on the Panthers’
opponent tomorrow, Syracuse (3-4),

l-“kickoff scheduled for l:30_ at Pitt

Stadium. _

“Syracuse is the most physical
team I’ve faced in my'four years
here,” he said. “They’re always a hell
of a team right down to thewire.”

Maas, of course, may have been
referring to l98l’s encounter at Pitt
Stadium when the Orangemen

jumped out to a 10-0 lead before the"

Panthers put the crush on 23-10. But
more to the point, Maas was allud-

{Sing to an Orange offensive line that

rivals the. Berlin Wall. ,

The big man is tackle John Werth,
a 6-4,‘ 270-__lb. senior who is comple-
mented by others in the 230-260
range. They are people who have the
uncanny ability to open holes for
three backs who so far are piling up
around four and a half yards per
carry. 6

“They have“a stronger offensive ‘

line than Navy,” Maas said after fac-
ing Napoleon McCallum, the
NCAA’s leading _rusher, last week.

«Q “We have to definitely shut down

their running game _to win this
game.” d '

Last week was not a classic one for
a Pitt defenisve line that surrendered
its first 100-plus-yard game to a sin-
gle back (I76). -

So far, halfbacks Jaime Coving-'

ton and Harold Gayden each have

Defensive Lineman Bill Maas

358 yards (hardly impressive), but
get 4.5 on each carry. Fullback Brent
Ziegler is about 50 total yards below,
but cranks out_4.7 per handoff.

And that is what bothers a Pitt
coaching staff, one enjoying a 5-2
record, faced with its second consec-
utive game featuring potential runa-
way people.

“Going into the Navy game we
were quite aware of McCallum as a
great back,” Pitt line coach Don
Thompson said. “Pitt always plays
well against the great backs, but
Napoleon was not playing with a
great team around him. '

“It was our job to contain him.
After reviewing the films, we some-
times shut him down. But if not, he'll
gain four or five yards; he’s that out-
standing.

“We w re in the right places at
times, but with a young football .
team, we can’t, afford to do that.
Then you end up missing intensity.”

Which leads up to Syracuse’s v
backs. If they are not running the
ball, they can burn linebackers on
short lobs, both Ziegler _and Coving-
ton 2-3 in receiving with 13 and 12
receptions, respectively. '

Add that to a week off after losing
17-6 to Penn State two weeks ago in
the Carrier Dome.

“We have to play with a lot more
intensity," Thompson said after last
week's performance. “Their running
game is loaded with talent and backs
that can take the ball the distance.

“That’s where our concern lies.‘
Their passing game is really dictated

Assistant Coac

Reprimanded     -

By SCOTT DELLETT

Pitt ‘assistant football coach

. Kent Schoolfield has been repri-

manded by head ' coach. F oge

Fazio for grabbing a student

trainer during Wednesday’s
practice.

“[The coaching staff] does not
grab or hit any player or member
of the team," Fazio said. “Kent
was wrong putting his hands on
the kid.

’ “It’s a unfortunate situation
that should have never
happened.”

Schoolﬁeld was trying to g-"
the trainer, senior John Bonat
roti, off the field as the team had
a huddle around -F azio before the
start of practice, according to a
report in yesterday's Pittsburgh‘.
Press. Bonaroti refused, stating
he had to perform his duties.
Bonaroti refused, stating he had

Bonaroti was banned from the
field by Fazio as disclipinary
action over an incident last
Thursday. ~According to the
Press article, Bonaroti was dis-
rupting a team, meeting Fazio
was conducting. ‘

“He was not allowed on the
ﬁeld,” Fazio said. “Kent was sup-
posed to ask the boy to leave the
field.” . /

Patsy DiThomasson, a city
policeman and volunteer secur-
ity guard for the team, said
Schoolfield did not hit Bonaroti
with a closed fist as he and cam-
pus officer Joe Patterson tried to
keep Schoolfield away from
Bonaroti. <

“He went up and grabbed
[Bonaroti] in the front of his shirt ‘
as [Sclioolfield] came back into
reach," he said. “John and Kent
were loud-mouthing each other,
shouting profanities, though
nothing was racial.” ' t

Schoolﬁeld is a . first-year
receiver coach at Pitt, having’
previously coached at Florida
State, New Mexico State and
Temple. He is known as a tough ,
disciplinarian. Bonaroti, a senior
from Monaca, is in the second

were at Center High School.

Feld declined to comment

just have not been demanding of
ourselves enough.” “

Case in point: Two weeks ago at
the Pitt Invitational, the Lady
Panthers won three of four matches.
That may‘ sound good, and it looks
even better in black and white, but
the level of competition was similar
to that of the teams Pitt ran over
early in the season, when théivteam
won its first five tournaments.

At the invitational, Pitt allowed
each team to gain a foothold,
stretching each match to at least four
games. The spikers have lost their
last two tournaments.

Today, the team leaves for tour-
nament No. 8, the Tennessee Clas-
sic, where it will be determined
whether or not the_Lady Panthers
are out of their- mid-season
doldrums. .

Collier begins his analysis of his
team's letdown by pointing out his
small roster and the time and effort
his athletes put‘into their studies.
The coach only has 10 players on his
team, and they have maintained at
least a 3.0 QPA in the previous three

terms. Several of his players "have -

America status for their efforts this
season. These include captain Judy
Young (pharmacy), outside ‘hitter
Pat Belcher (business) and sopho-
more Sally Gillespie (biology).
Collier places some of the blame
on the team’s early charge from the
gates, when the spikers compiled a
19-2 record. Infact, the squad was
undefeated until its 13th match, los-
ing to arch-rival Penn State, of al
teams. _ B
“We may have taken our team

development for granted, figuring

19

we’d keep getting better and better,
Collier explained. “It took some
losses to kick us in the butt and get
us working harder.”

The coach believes that losing the A i

two tournaments was well-timed.
“We need to regroup and mount a
serious charge at the Big East and
the NCAAs.”i -

A factor not to be.overlooked- in

the team‘s recent inconsistencies. is‘
its‘ relative youth. Collier has no t

seniors, and holding down the most
pivotal positionpin ‘the line-up are
two players inexperienced at that
spot. ' - -

The Pitt News, Friday, October 18, 1983

Lady Spikerssihake

continued from paﬂe nineteen

The position is setting, and the
players are Judy Young and Cathy
Rupp, both juniors, who are still
learning the insand outs of setting.
In essence, they are freshmen, in
addition to the two real rookies Col-
lier starts.

_iHow Rupp and Young develop
greatly affects how the team
develops.

“They are the keys to our success,
and how close they come to master-
ing setting will determine how suc-
cessful we are,” Collier said.

Nearly simultaneous injuries to
these players several weeks ago may
have precipitated the team’s mid-
season drop-off. Collier maintains
that his setters were developing on
schedule, and their injuries hurt the
team’s development.

As a result, the spikers find them-
selves behind other programs. To
compensate, Collier has had the
men’s volleyball club come to Trees
Hall to give the Lady Panthers a
shot of the medicine they will receive
in Tennessee. Collier concedes that
it may have been a case of overkill;
the coach and his players agree that
these practices have been painful
due to the focus on defense (i.e., the
floor) but have been effective in
pumping up the players and in
improving their defense immensely

Collier hopes‘ the demanding’

practices have generated enough
intensity and confidence to put his
team in a position to win some
matches this weekend. Collier gave
his athletes a break last weekend,
not so much to let them find out
what they have missed at the f.rat
parties but to let them rest with the
intention that they come back better
after the break.

The time off and the intense prac-
tices may have given the spikers
enough bumps and bruises to carry
them -through the weekend, but they
have also generated positive ‘feelings
among the players.

“The time off helped us to recover
and put things in perspective,” Rupp
remarked. “We were in a slump, but
we're definitely coming out of it.”

Young attributes the positive feel-
ings to the hard work in practice as
well as the break’ in the’ action last
weekend. .

Middle blocker Carmen Tapia,
whom Collier says has been an effec-
tivc team leader, agrees with her
teammates.

The 5-ll sophomore commented,

“The break let us have some time to
ourselves, but we are hungry to play
again. We need to regain our confi-
dence this weekend.”

The journey South, will be the
team’s first trip in an airplane this

“It will be weird playing 

her ‘rather than beside her, but. I'm

excited about going down there,”-

Hoover said. . _-
Collier asserts that his team will

be concentrating on playing aggres-
sive, conﬁdent volleyball rather than

focusing only on winning. The conﬂ-

. dence appears to be there, but there

is also a niggling, ‘itchy suspicion ——‘
the most important question on this
midterm: “Is the slump over?...” .

The Pitt men’s cross country
team's“~’ goal for the Big East
championships, held on Saturday at
Boston College, was._to improve
upon last season's eighth-place
ﬁnish in the nine-team conference;

Though they ﬁnished eighth
again, the Panthers did improve; it is
just that the conference has
improved as much and probably
more.

For example, Todd Colas, the
Panthers’ top ﬁnisher at 30th,

‘completed -the five-mile test in

40-seco nd
last year’s

24:26.6, a 30- to
improvement over
34th-place finish.
“The Big East improved as much
as we did,” Panther coach John

. Vasvary said. “Our guys all ran

better times than they ever have.
Some of them were running
[personal records] for the first two

and three miles.”

Our first seven guys ran faster
than our No. 2 man ran last year."

The Panthers entered" nine
participants — four seniors, a junior
and four freshmen."

“It is great experience for the
freshmen,” Vasvary said. “Now they
know what the Big East is all about.
When they go back next year, they'll
know what they're up against.

“[Bill Moorhead, Garland Brown
and Colas] are looking forward to
indoor and outdoor [track] seasons.
They are more half-milers and
milers. ‘Hopefully we’ll be able to get
some good distance guys for next
year, because I think we have a
pretty good class of freshmen.

Behind Colas for the Panthers
were freshman John Thomas, 4lst
(24:58.2); Moorhead, 56th (25:29.4);
freshman John Mooney, 61st

“We finishedtogether well as a
team,” Vasvary said. “John Thomas
(the freshman from Gateway) ran
very well.”

The individual winner was
Marcus O’Sullivan of Villanova.
The winning time was unavailable.

Villanova was also the team
champ with 45 points. Georgetown
was second with 48, Providence was
third with 59 (the Friars were
without the services of Jeff Smith,
who placed second in the New York

‘ City Marathon).

Syracuse finished fourth (I19).
Connecticut was fifth (135), St.
John’s sixth (136), Boston College
seventh (156), Pitt eighth (227) and
Seton Hall ninth (263).

Intensity To Stop
Running Attack

continued from page nineteen
by what they do: Play action or boo-
tlegs with two tight ends or a power-
I.”
Between Ziegler and Covington,

up there also with 13 catches, second
with 150 total yards.

Syracuse runs an offense around
with these few — along with receiv-
ers Mike Morris, Mike Siano and
tight end Marty Chalk ~— that relies
on quick quarterback drops and
rapid dumps to any eligible receiver.

That is how the Orangeman
“found themselves as a football
team,” Thompson noted, after a blo-
wout against Nebraska (63-7) and
losses to Maryland (34-13) and Penn
State.

“They always come out with
something different,” Pitt head
coach Foge Fazio said, “and are usu-
ally successful against us in the first
quarter. So we have to be prepared
for what they’ve done different the
last two weeks.

“There will be a lot of play-
action.”

“We feel they’re going to do what

they do best: run the ball and keep it-

away from our offense,” Thompson
said. “We have to put them in long
situations and play much better on
first down than last week.”

There’s that Navy game again.
The McCallum nemesis will not long
be forgotten by a still-spurting def-
ensive line that reveals several ﬁrst-
year starters (tackle Tim Quense and
ends Chris Doleman and Bill Sapio)
and two sophomore alternating
guards (Bob Schilken and Dennis
Atiyeh).

They looked in the paper, saw Pitt
considered 21-point favorites, and
out the window went intensity. The
lesson from that mistake became
clear.

“It’s a matter of being young,
inexperienced and having to play up
to your performance level,” Thomp-
son said. “You can’t afford to be lax,
you can’t afford to be down 70 per-
cent —- they’ll get blown off.

“I hope this Navy game was a
learning experience for the players.
They were expected to win big, then
they got bit in the face. It was a
surprise for them.”

“We made a lot of mental mis-
takes and were not executing the
defense out to the end,” Maas said.
“We made far too many mistakes
defensively; nothing too big, but if
we let it go, it will be a problem.”

There is no problem in under-

,standing that Syracuse exploits its

point production primarily out of
the backs already mentioned, six
TDs between them.

It all calls for a rebound by Pitt’s
defensive line from the McCallum
fiasco.

“There’s a strong football team
coming in here Saturday,” Fazio
said, “so we’ll have to be strong
ourselves.”

GRID BITS: Fazio and his staff will
decide after the Syracuse game on
John Cummings’ possible redshirt.
He had his left collarbone broken
during Pitt’s last play against Ten-
nessee....Defensive end Tony
Woods, out for the season with a
fractured ankle and torn ligaments
suffered‘ against Navy, cannot be

redshirted....Fazio hopes to use con-‘

verted defensive back Billy Owens at
tailback tomorrow....Owens gained
50 yards on six carries in the waning
moments of the Louisville game-
....Sophomore Barry Pettyjohn will

‘start his second straight game at

right guard, alternating with
another sophomore, Bob Brown-
.....Mike Dahl, who pulled a hamst-
ring at fall camp, will not start at
that slot, though Fazio says he's
healthy....Pitt is sixth in the country
in scoring defense, allowing ll.4
points per game, is 17th in total
defense (285.3 yds./ game) and 22nd
in passing defense (155.3 yds. / game-
)....Flanker Dwight Collins, with 23
TD grabs, is still looking for the one
that will break his tie with former
Panther Julius Dawkins....Last
week, Navy held Collins out of the
statistical co1umn....Pitt has
defeated Syracuse (Pitt ahead in the
series 23-13-2) 10 straight times,
allowing only two TDs in their last
three meetings....QB John “Ace”
Congemi has gone the past three
games without throwing an
interception.

going back a ways by having Myron
Cope as one of our two “Guest
Gurus” this week.

These - days, Myron is better
known for his ice-shattering voice
on WTAE-TV and Radio; but he
also handled sports editor duties
back in 1950. Since then, he’s been a
contract writer, or special contribu-

tor, with Sports Illustrated; has,

broadcast Steeler games with play?‘

by-play man Jack Fleming since
I970 and just recently celebrated his
l0th anniversary as talk show host
on WTAE in the 7-8 p.m. slot. Cope
is also filling in for color man
Johnny Sauer on Pitt football
broadcasts. Sauer is taking the year
off after undergoing heart bypass
surgery prior to Pitt’s season.
Another Pitt News oldie-but-

goodie is our second Guest Guru,-'

Murray Chass. Chass, now in his
14th year with The New York Times,
was sports editor and managing edi-
tor here during the late ’50s, prior to

__starting out with the Associated

Press in his senior yearl

“I went to Pitt when they -had the
bad [football] teams," Chass said
recently. “But at least they didn't try
to buy their teams.” .

It seems Murray has become
savvy since his collegiate days.

For the better part of those l4
years, Chass wrote on pro football
and major ‘league baseball, though
the last seven years have been spent
primarily on-baseball coverage. He
also contributes pieces to such tab-_
loids ‘as The Sporting News and
Sport. _I

Chass, though, is one who seemed
veryreluctant to offer his “prognos-

tication skills” to The Pitt News col- '

lege football gurus. He spent nearly
15 minutes picking favorites and
spreads for us. The phone bill will
reflect your scientific thinking,
Murray.

‘ With Myron, though, the picking
process was much easier. Betting.
lines can do that. ‘ _

Now it’s on to the games we_’ve
specially picked out. Mark A.
Sindler, the “Grocery Bagger,” fig-
ures_Boston College will find victory
over Penn State since the Eagles cur-
rently have the sixth-ranked passing
offense in the nation. And Penn
State? Their defense against the pass
isn’t even ranked.

In Miami, Hurricane coach How-
ard Schnellenberger carries a 22-2
record under Orange Bowl sunshine
into their game with West Virginia.
How can you not pick a guy whose
name takes Herculean effort to
spell‘? Besides, the Hurricanes have
the third best total defense in the
nation. ‘

Though Maryland is llth in total’
offense, it may not be enough as
North Carolina enters this big ACC

matchup with the country’s third-'*F9.,

ranked total offense and seventh-
ranked total defense. Look to see
Tar Heel tracks in College Park. -

Over in Champaign, Ill., Illini
fans may break out the bubbly early
and make reservations for Rose
Bowl ‘accomodations if the home-
town favorites stick Michigan at the
stake.’ ,7

Both schools are deadlocked at
5-0 in the Big 10. And this week's Big
I0 doormat contest pits Wisconsin
in Buckeye country. Ohio State in a
walk.

Note for our faithful followers:
The Boston College game is being
played in Foxboro, Mass.’s Shaefer

-Stadium, and LSU and Mississippi

also square off in neutral territory —-
Jackson, Miss.
