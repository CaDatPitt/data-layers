Freshman conquers the

"Be cool . . . but cure.”

Enrollment rises 14%
despite higher standards

.N...E.¢°'e...'.<!!."

This year freshman enrollment
is up a significant 14 percent from
last year, which means that 2,841
freshmen are embarking on their
college careers at Pitt.

Pennsylvania residents make up
79 percent of total freshmen and
the remaining 21 percent are out-
of-state. There has been a signifi-
cant increase in the number of out-
of—state students since 1986, when
only 9 percent of students were
from out-of-state.

Pii spokesman Ken Service
says that the overall efforts of the
Student Recruitment office have
contributed to the increase in out-
of-state students. “Recruiting from
a broader geographical range,”
Service said, “is what accom-
plished the effect on student enroll-
ment.”

Some people were worried that
by placing greater emphasis on get-
ting more out-of-state students to

 

enroll at Pitt, there would be losses
for Pennsylvania students. For
instance, a decrease in admittance
of PA residents and less ‘financial
aid if more spots and money were
given to out-of—states.

This theory was disproven
when the Recruitment office
accomplished their goal of greater
geographical diversity at Pitt and
also increased Pennsylvania stu-
dent enrollment over the past two
years. The number of Pennsylvania
freshmen has risen from 2,013 last
year to 2,244 this year and out-of-
state enrollment is up from 472 to
597.

Minority enrollment has stayed
about the same since last year, with
551 total minority this year and 524
last year. Minorities compose 12
percent of Pitt freshmen.

Last school year there was
some controversy over whether
Pitt’s S.A.T. standards were high
enough, and although no official

 

Pitt moves its

Commuter

Resource Center off campus

Sall Stewart

   

The Commuter Resource Center
has been relocated in a move designed
to centralize services, provide “one-
stop shopping” for students looking
for off-campus housing, and to deter
slurnlords from preying on students.

Pitt decided at the end of May to
relocate the off-campus apartment
rental service from the former
Commuter Resource Center in the
William Pitt Union, to the office of
‘Property Management, located at 237
Atwood St.

As a result of this move, the
Teleserve Rentline, an extensive data-
base of rental units in Oakland and
surrounding areas maintained by the
Commuter Resource Center for stu-
dents looking for off-campus housing,

has been discontinued.

In a letter responding to a student
inquiry about the changes, Ken
O’Shaughnessy, director of property
management, said the Teleserve
Rentline was discontinued because a
“significant number” of landlords list-
ing their apartments through it “had
notorious reputations for leasing and
operating sub-standard, or in some
cases, uninhabitable units.”

Another reason stated in the letter
was that the listing “inadvertently
encouraged both undergraduate and
graduate students to live in off-cam-
pus rental units in a manner that was
inconsistent with the recently devel-
oped (and adopted) University of
Pittsburgh housing strategy.”

According to O’Shaughnessy, the
University and residents of the

Night of Pitt traditions
bonds freshman class

Anthon Breznican

   

Pitt Alumni shared an ‘evening of
new" and old traditions with this year’s
freshman class on Tuesday night, wel-
coming them to the university in two
ceremonies held at the Cathedral of
Learning and Heinz Chapel.

The women of the class of 2000
processed to Heinz Chapel for the
annual Lantern Night Ceremony, a 76
year old tradition symbolizing the
women’s quest for knowledge and
truth.

Freshmen men met in the
Commons Room of the Cathedral of
Learning for a new tradition known as
the Night of the Panther Ceremony, a
two-year-old annual event devised to
parallel the Lantern Night Ceremony.

Joe Cavalla, director of student
activities, organized the men for their
march from the student union to the
Cathedral of Learning.

“Sometimes people feel that tradi-
tions like these are a little bit hokey.
Maybe they are, but everybody needs
tradition, and we’re trying to get
[Panther Night] started as a long-stand-
ing tradition for Pitt,” Cavalla said.

Andrew J. Kuzneski, president of

Pitt’s Alumni Association, compared
entering this University to becoming
part of a family.

“Tonight you join a new family —
the Pitt family. Just like your own fam-
ily has traditions, so is Pitt full of tra-
ditions as well,” Kuzneski said.

Milling and murmuring, meeting
and greeting each other as they gath-
ered, both groups of freshmen
processed to the ceremonies Interim
Vice Chancellor Robert P. Gallagher
referred to as “an experience to inspire
[freshmen] well into the next century
as they enter this very hallowed insti-
tution of Pitt.”

Gallagher and former president of
the Alumni Association, J. Roger
Glunt, welcomed the freshmen men to
the Night of the Panther, reminding the
men that this ceremony represented the
gift of strength so that they can carry
on the other proud traditions of Pitt.

“You enhance the degrees that
each of us who have graduated from
Pitt already have, as freshmen years
from now will enhance your degrees
and carry on the same traditions we
celebrate tonight,” Glunt said.
“Remember: Alumni are the only per-

’ Across the Nation

.-

WASHINGTON — A long—classified
intelligence report shows that the
Pentagon, the White House, the
Central Intelligence Agency, and the
State Department were alerted in
November 1991 that chemical
weapons had been stored in an Iraqi
ammunition depot that was blown up
earlier that year by a group of
American troops.

The report was relayed by the
Joint Chiefs of Staff to American mil-
itary commanders around the world
and then remained hidden in files at
the Pentagon and other governmental
agencies even as the Defense
Department issued statement after
statement suggesting that it had no
evidence that large numbers of
American troops‘ might have been

~\exposed to chemical weapons.

The November 1991 report, which
 s marked “priority,” was never
shared with the troops themselves. The
estimated 150 American soldiers who
participated in the demolition mission
in March 1991 in the southern Iraqi
desert were informed only this spring
that they may have been exposed to a
"cloud of mustard gas and sarin, a
nerve agent. The New York Times

SAN FRANCISCO

Moving

aggressively to cut off state services to
illegal immigrants under the new
Federal welfare overhaul, Gov. Pete
Wilson signed an executive order that
would end those immigrants’ access to
benefits ranging from prenatal care
and public housing to child abuse pre-
vention programs.

That ballot initiative, denying"

state services to people who enter the
United States illegally, was approved
overwhelmingly by California voters
in 1994 but has been enjoined by court
order since then. .

Neither the new Federal welfare
act nor the govemor’s order would bar
illegal immigrants from public prima-
ry or secondary schools, as the ballot
proposition was supposed to, or from
emergency health care. But officials
said the new restrictions would cover
hundreds of other state services and
programs, including many that were
not contemplated under the initiative.

JERUSALEM — Thef long—festering
resentment that rigorously Orthodox
Jews hold against ., Israel’s activist
Supreme Court broke into the open
last week when. several religious
newspapers assailed the court’s presi-
dent as a -“new dictator” and “danger—
ous enemy.”

The fierce volley and an equally
furious report from secular politicians

Court as a central battleground in the
old and bitter struggle between reli-
gious and secular Israelis over whether
the Jewish state should be built on

Jewish or civil law. The New York,

MOSCOW — Russian and Chechen
military commanders signed an agree-
ment committing them to a military
disengagement in the ravaged capital
of rebellious Chechnya.

But the Russian official who bro-
kered the truce, Aleksandr Lebed,
remained pinned down in Moscow,
unable to secure President Boris
Yeltsin’s blessing for a broader peace
accord that is being denounced by
Russian nationalists as a sell-out.

The document was an accord to

withdraw Russian and rebel troops

from the Chechen capital, Grozny, by
Sept. 1. The pullbacks are to begin on
Wednesday, despite recent violations
of a cease—fire reached last week. The
agreement also calls for joint units to

will not be able to meet the ambitious
drug crop eradication goal it set for
this year, one government official

said.

Under heavy pressure from the
United States to adopt stringent anti-
narcotics measures, the government
had pledged to wipe out more than
100,000 acres of coca and opium pop-
pies this year.

But the official, who spoke on the

‘ ‘condition of anonymity, said unusual-

ly heavy rains and a revolt by coca
growers in Colombia’s impoverished
south had hurt the eradication effort,
which involved aerial spraying of
illicit crops with an herbicide that
washes off in the rain. Reuters

WASH__INGTON — A day after a
Cuban court convicted Robert L.

at best.

Vesco ﬂed the United States a
quarter-century ago to avoid a series
of indictments on charges of fraud and
racketeering. He spent 13 or 14 years
living in exile under the patronage of

President Fidel Castro until his arrest

last year on charges of “being a provo-
cateur and an agent of foreign special
services,” although he was eventually
convicted for fraud and “illicit eco-
nomic activity.” The New York Times

Koehler to resign as head of

School of Arts and Sciences

Dean to oversee School's reorganization
for next two years before Ieaaving

 

Peter Koehler, current dean of
the newly restructured College of
Arts and Sciences, announced his
impending resignation from the
position yesterday.

Koehler, a physics professor,
has been dean of the Faculty of Arts
and Sciences since 1986 and recent-
ly directed the restructuring of the
school after the departure of Dean
Briscoe, of the College of Arts and
Sciences, and Dean Soffa, of gradu-
ate studies.

Koehler intends to continue
with his current position as dean for
two years, after which he will leave
the position and return to the class-
room.

“When Provost Benjamin
recruited me in 1986, he indicated
that my administrative appointment
would be for an initial term of five
years,” Koehler wrote in a letter to
his colleagues in the Faculty of Arts
and Sciences. “In 1991, Provost

Henderson extended it for another
term of five years.  Earlier this
month [I had] the opportunity to
think about the other things I still
want to accomplish during the
remainder of my professional life. I
concluded that I could not hope to
achieve those other goals if I con-
tinued in this administrative capac-
ity too much longer.”

Koehler will stay on for two
years in order to maintain the struc-
ture of CAS, and has announced his
resignation at this time in order to
give the remaining administrators
ample time to find a replacement.

“Provost Maher  agreed that I
would remain as dean for two more
years in order to avoid an interrup-
tion of the implementation of the
[restructuring] at this critical junc-
ture,” Koehler wrote.

‘‘I thank Dean Koehler for his
willingness to remain as Dean to
oversee the implementation of the
restructuring of the Arts and
Sciences and the development of
the planning process,” Maher
wrote. “I _have assured him that this
important service would not be
extended beyond the summer of
1998, by which time we should be

‘able to have a new dean on board.”

Koehler said that he expects the
search for his replacement as dean
to begin "during the coming year.

“This announcement is
designed to allow plenty of time for
the administration to appoint and
prepare for a new dean,” Koehler
said. “And then I can get back to
doing what a faculty member
should be doing.”

Koehler said he will return to
teaching and research when his res-
ignation becomes effective.

“When my appointment as dean
concludes, I look forward to joining
[the faculty] as a faculty colleague
and devoting my time and energy
fully to teaching and research as a

Enrollment

tallies for freshmen scores have
been taken yet, Service said that
“the quality of incoming students
in test scores is up this year.”
Indicative of the quality of students
are the 476 students who qualified
for honors programs at Pitt.

A student had to achieve a min-
imum combined S.A.T. score of
1270 to be considered for the hon—
ors program this year. Last year the
minimum was a score of 1200, and
there has still been an increase of
100 students who qualified.

Service said that the 14 percent
increase in enrollment may be due
to “recognition, finally, that Pitt is
a pretty good educational value and
the efforts put forth by Pitt finally
are paying off.”

Pitt was

 

listed in Money

Magazine ‘s “100 Best Buys” for_

colleges, as one of three
Pennsylvania schools and the only
public school, the other two being
Swarthmore and Grove City
College.

The Office of Communications
at Pitt did its annual survey of
incoming freshmen opinions and
came up with some informative sta-
tistics. It seems that 60 percent of
the respondents think there is
indeed intelligent life somewhere
else in the universe, with 67 per-
cent of men believing compared to
only 55 percent of women.

Race relations in the US have
gotten better according to 36 per-
cent of the respondents, 27 percent
feel they have gotten worse, and
the remaining 37 percent are unde-
cided. If the presidential election
were held today, 50 percent of stu-
dents would vote for Bill Clinton
and 18 percent for Bob Dole, while
32 percent said they wouldn’t vote
for either candidate.

One last promising fact is that
eighty percent of the students
expect to be better off than their
parents when they reach their par-
ents’ age. Eighty—three percent
believe that being happy in your
job is more important that making a
lot of money.

manent members of a university.
Students come and go, teachers come
«and go, but alumni are here forever.”

Chancellor Mark Nordenberg
reminded the female members of the
freshmen class of the importance and
the history of their role in the
University.

“The foundation of Lantern Night
was laid 101 years ago when two sisters,

1 Helen and Margaret Stein became the

4_ I..--

first women enrolled in Pitt,”
Nordenberg said. “This gift of light is a
symbol of new beginning, of your
power to see in an unforgiving world,
and of your freedom to search for the
truth here at the University of
Pittsburgh.”

The lanterns carried by the fresh-
men women were lit by alumni symbol-
izing the passing on of knowledge and
truth.

Male students were given panther
pins to symbolize the passage of power
and integrity to a new generation of Pitt
students.

Nordenberg emphasizes the rela-
tionship between alumni and current
students, as well as the bond of all mem-
bers of the class of 2000.

“Remember that this night cele-
brates the collective light of all of you,”
Nordenberg said. ’

Public Affairs James V. Maher spoke of

the responsibility of the new students to
hold up the traditions of the University
while pursuing their education.

“Your success is the way in which
you develop your own social, intellectu-
al and moral prerogatives,” Maher said.
“You are all being challenged to follow
in the footsteps of alumni and faculty
who will support and instruct you at
your time here.”

Perhaps the most important part of
the ceremony was the sense of together-
ness felt by the students who attended.

“You are here to design the person
you will become,” Maher said. “Just
remember all of the other people here
tonight: students, faculty and alumni,
and know that you are not alone.”

developing a plan of action, using
three—dimensional imaging and

the accompanying tumor.

With the new plan, the patient
is moved into the line of fire of the
Gamma Knife and the surgery
begins.

Following the operation, the
patient is kept under observation
for at least four hours.

The patient is released in a day

to a day-and—a—half, barring any
further medical problems.

Since 1987, the UPMC has
been conducting operations of this
type with great success. The new
Gamma Knife, coupled with the
experience and knowledge of the
physicians, will allow further suc-
cess and improvements in neuro-
logical surgery of a highly deli-
cate nature that was unimaginable
decades ago.

Local heroes Hurl and
Blunderbuss will draw tears from nos-
talgic, smart—dressed boys and girls
when they rock the Beehive with
Empire Builder on Friday. Anyone
who is new in town should catch this
event, and get hip to what national
record labels like Third Gear and
Homestead have known all along. This
show will start at 8 p.m. at the Oakland
Beehive.

 Or, call up Paul Williams at WPTS

and ask him how to get to his party
instead. Corduroys will do the indie-
pop thing, the Space Invaders will
unleash a contemplative barrage of
sight/sound fury, and Mike Shanley’s
band Mystery Date will play a
stripped—down set. Ask Stephanie
Alarcon at WPTS about the rave that

- _ will follow the bands.

Monday, September 2

Get ready for a scary Gothic night
at the Birmingham Gallery (20 South
14th Street on the South Side) when
Faith & the Muse, Sunshine Blind,
Ichor and Malign bring their
“Apparition Tour” to Pittsburgh.
Faith & the Muse features goth legend
William Faith (formerly known by his

close friends as Bill E. Bones) of
Christian Death, Shadow Project and
Mephisto Waltz, playing with Monica
Richards of Strange Boutique fame.
Fans of dark music already know who
these cats are.

Their live performances are con-
sidered among the most impressive in
the genre, combining elements of the-
atre, Classical and Celtic music, among
other things. If you’ve seen The Crow
one too many times, and if smoking
clove cigarettes in front of the Beehive
has got you feeling gloomy, check it
out. Call 422-8864 for more info.

Everyone loves Neil Young. For
three decades now, he has been record-
ing consistently amazing records that
reﬂect the essence and spirit of North
American life. He has made a career
out of shattering audience preconcep-
tions with the release of each new
album and through his awesome live
performances. The Media Machine
invented something known as
“grunge” a few years ago, and then
they decided that they needed to invent
a “godfather” to go along with all that
grunge, so they attached an embarrass-
ing and stupid title to him.

Neil has proven to be ahead of his

;Abanclon the mash pits for a cerebral night at the Symphony!

The Pittsburgh
Orchestra is entering its second cen-
tury of making music. Like every-
thing else, symphony will probably
change over the course of the years.
The one thing that will remain con-
stant, however, is that the music they
play is the richest in the world.

There is something magical
about symphonic pieces. They have
depth that is not found in any other
music. The works of various com-
posers have a structure that can be
heard. Those who think that the
lyrics of some strung out junkie with
a guitar are "deep would find unfath-
omable oceans in Heinz hall down-
town.

If there was one concert that I
could have filled Heinz Hall with
everyone I know to hear, it would
have been when Bobby McFerrin

Symphony-

conducted the Pittsburgh Symphony

’Orchestra. The vocalist of “Don’t

Worry, Be Happy” fame is also a
conductor and grammy-winning jazz
musician. He had a set program,
including “The Sorcerer’s
Apprentice” of “Fantasia” fame, but
that didn’t stop him from adding to
the performance. ,
McFerrin’s whole approach was
one of interaction withthe orchestra
and the audience. Even though he
had a set list of pieces he was going
to conduct, he left time for improvis-
ing songs based on the names of the
audience members, scat singing jazz
with one of the bass players, and
singing songs.with the audience. He
turned first the orchestra, and then
the audience into a chorus singing
“Thus Spake Zarathustra” (you’ll

remember it, if you’ve ever seen,

200]). By far the best part of the

V performance was when he had the

audience singing “Head, Shoulders,

_Knees, and Toes.” It was the most

exercise many of those folks had in a
long time. ,

McFerrin gave the Orchestra an
extra long break before the intermis-
sion. He performed some of his
vocal works from earlier albums and
random improvisation. He also did a
vocal musical review of “The
Wizard of Oz.”

By the end, even the stodgier
members of the crowd were partici-
pating. It was not a traditional con-
cert, but by deviating from the norm,
he was trying to teach people to

. appreciate music. The last piece he

conducted was Symphony Number 1
in C Major, by Bizet. He insisted
that people did not clap between the

movements and tried to get them to
not do the coughing thing to avoid
the uncomfortable silences between
movements. The goal was to get
people to appreciate the notes by
appreciating the space between
them.

I gained more appreciation for
music from this one show than just
about anything else that I had ever
listened to.

So, having had this uplifting
experience, I shall now try to
explain how to go to the symphony.

The first thing to realize is that
Mozart can make you smarter. So, it
is perfectly acceptable to go to the
symphony to avoid studying for a
test or writing a paper.

How does this work? Well, it
seems that the music stimulates cer-

tain neural pathways. These path-
ways stay active and provide some
lasting effects. Sometimes, the
effects last only 10 minutes, but
that’s not the point. The point is that
you enjoy the benefits of greater
intelligence, which will build on
itself. Although the tests on this phe-
nomenon were conducted only with
Mozart’s piano concertos, other
classical music should work as well.
While no studies have been done to
substantiate this next claim, it is
postulated that if complex music can
make you smarter, simple, repetitive
indie rock can make you less intelli-
gent.

There are other mental effects

'l'I-IE iPI'I"I' NEWS/T

associated with the symphony. If
you are going to go, you ought to
take the excuse to dress to the nines.
How often do college students really
get to be all gussied up? Some folks
look at it as an advantage of being a
college student, but eventually the
job interviews and real world will
come. We’ll all have to wear suits
and ties at some point. It will be
good to get a little practice.

Besides this, psychologists say
that dressing smartly can help you
think smartly. Physiology and psy-
chology come into play. This could
add to that neural stimulation that
comes from the music.

Next, how can you get all

gussied up, go to the symphony, get
smarter, and not have a good meal
before or afterwards? The meal is
essential. It is important to eat well.

It is important to have culture. In
this age of multi-culturalism, one
must appreciate the music of all of
civilization, not just Seattle,
Pittsburgh or Los Angeles.

Finally, there are group dis-
counts. So form a symphony club.
Get a bunch of your friends together
to buy tickets as a group You and all
your friends will be smarter, more
cultured, and better prepared to be
well-dressed for interviews.

nights. There is also an afternoon
concerton Sundays. Heinz Hall is a
beautiful escape from the grey of
Pittsburgh winters. Tickets can be
purchased at the Box Office or by
phone.

Heinz Hall is located on the cor-
ner of Penn and Lorin Maazel
avenues downtown. It is a couple of
blocks from the stops of the 61 and
71 buses, but well worth it. Greater
intelligence, poise, and grace will
result.

Go to the symphony and give up
the mosh pits for a better, more civi-
lized life.

Live

arena-rock peers by touring with bands
too hip for his Zippo-waving crowd to
get into. Sonic Youth had this “prob-
lem” when Neil took them on board in
‘92. Social Distortion, with their nos-
talgic rockabilly punk, did not have
this problem. We’ll see if the kids and
parents who paid between $20 and $40
to see Neil can get into Jason
Spaceman’s Spiritualized when they
open up for him ‘at Starlake on
Tuesday.

Last month, former Spacemen 3
innovator Sonic Boom’s project E.A.R.
played for about 50 people at Synod
Hall. The audience was appreciative
and thirsty for more sound. Some peo-
ple balked at the $10 entrance fee.

Spiritualized represents the ﬂip side of
this‘ post—Spacemen 3 equation. They
have managed to maintain their musi-
cal integrity, while making videos and
robbing their audience blind (just kid-
ding). I read a while ago that they
shared Neil Young’s tour manager, so I
guess that explains this unlikely pair-
mg.

It also makes sense when you con-
sider the fact that Neil is responsible
for the brilliant Tonight's the Night
album, which many classic rockers
would consider to be the ultimate med-
itation on heroin and rock ‘n roll, and
Spiritualized has pretty much taken up
the task of further meditating on such
self-medication for a whole new gener-

'I'HE PI'l"l' NEWS

       

 

ation of kids. Each new record that
they put out builds on the same theme,
but they do it so damn well that it’s
hard to complain. Spiritualized really

does bathe the listener in sheer gui-‘

tar/vocal beauty, while other self-pro-
claimed psychedelic bands just wish
they do.

As if this wasn’t enough incentive,
country maniacs Steve Earl and the
Dukes are playing as well. This guy
just got out of rehab, -for goodness
sakes! It looks like he’s touring in good
company.

Hop the fence if the price ain't
right, because missing living legends
like Neil Young, Steve Earl, and Jason
Spaceman is just plain wrong.

LoIIey's Rumour Mill: Cute bands and negative vibes -

THE PI'l"I' NEWS

 

Thursday, August 29, I 99.6

dominate Pittsburgh’s mainstream rock scene

A heated summer has boiled up
some changes in the local music
scene. Political conflict between
group members have left bands like
Brownie Mary and Blindsight seek-
ing new musicians.

Brownie Mary _
Ex—BM drummer Dave Ryan and

ex—BM bassist Tim Gabriel left-

Kelsey Barber and Rich Jaques after
a dispute concerning BM’s musical
vision. BM has taken on numerous
group members that have ended ties
with musical disagreements.

Ryan has joined The Barbara
Blue Band, after some hard feelings
within the BM team. Working with

_ upscale musicians on a jazz fusion

I’!

side project takes up Ryan’s spare
time now that BM has been trying out
new members.

BM’s manager Todd Owens says
that Barber and Jaques are working
together on a CD that will feature all-
new tracks. Owens doesn’t think that
the replacement of BM’s rhythm sec-
tion is a sign of weakness, but rather
an opportunity to sharpen goals. BM
has a full schedule this fall which
they intend to use on trying out new
members. The closest show dates will
be Sept 7 for the Pittsburgh’s

Cultural Trust Event downtown, and
Sept 27 at Nick’s Fat City on the
South Side. '
Blindsight

Blindsight suffered a mysterious
loss of band members Ketan
Bakrania (Bass), Ken Culton
(Drums), and Dino Lopriato (percus-
sions) after production disputes over
their forthcoming CD. Campaigning
a spiritual renaissance, Blindsight
has ‘surprised its audience with their
recent breakup. Lead guitar and
vocalist Lenny Williams hired musi-
cians to play out the rest of the CD,
Energy?, rumored to be released in
September. Like BM, BS has experi-
enced a long history of band mem-
bers —- 11 to be exact. Williams orig-
inated BS in 1992, and its most
recent members had been together for
two years. ,

In an interview, Williams said,
“Dino, Ketan, and Ken lived a com-
plete life in Blindsight, but
Blindsight is my life. They have to
find their calling.” He believes that
the time was perfect for the band to
revamp and that a new phase will fol-
low.

“They are realizing that it’s not
their dream,” said Williams. “There

is a new magic being created.” He
still plans on playing out when he
finds a new caravan of spiritualized
musicians.

Ex—BS percussionist Dino
Lopriato says that the problems
began when Williams hired outside
producer Chip Davis to change the
way BS sounded. Lopriato feels that
Davis is trying to produce BS com-
mercially and doesn’t understand
what the music is about.

“His vibes were so negative,”
said Lopriato. “It wasn’t us.”

Lopriato said that BS was about
spreading peace and unity, but didn’t
feel that theme during the production
differences. Lopriato, Culton, and
Bakrania had a meeting to discuss the
predicament, and they all decided
that Williams’ cooperation with
Davis was wrong for the band, and
so, they left. Lopriato, Culton, and
Bakrania plan to continue playing
and possibly start their own ensemble
called Unity.

Nixon Clocks

The Nixon Clocks are still
together and are scheduled to release
a new CD in mid—September. There
will be four live tracks and four stu-
dio songs. Lead singer Barry has quit

D.O.S.E. are in a preproduction

are open for fraternity dates.

The Dharma Sons are playing
September 7 at Sullivan Hall for Pitt.
DS is two years old and has remained.
a three piece band for that time. DS

bassist Matt Dudek says that their .

and REM. DS’ live shows are one of

tunes along with a cute smile. DS are

for an all ages show.
Cloud

Cloud is the new face on the
music scene, combining two new
female vocalists, Sarah Siplik and
Megan Siegel, and members of the
old Affordable Floors, Jeff Babcock,
Kurk Botula and Ken Zenkevich.
Botula is the songwriter for the group
and chose female vocalists because it
adds a powerful element to the emo-
tiona1ly—centered material. Botula
said in an interview that his intro-
spective songs concentrate on peo-
ple’s lives and are written around the
instruments.

Lead vocalist Siplik used to sing
for a high school cover band, per-
forming at various dive bars and
loves Jesus. Backup vocalist Siegel
is a student at Pitt and a member of
Kappa Kappa Gamma. Both vocalists
were chosen from 60-70 auditions.
Cloud has only recently debuted at
the Swan Songs CD release party this
past month, but is already working
on recordings. The skills of older
musicians and the crisp voices of
new singers are selling points for
Cloud that will make them a hot
number this coming year.

PSOAS ’

Earthy rhythms and world beat
melodies are this group’s calling
card. PSOAS released their first CD

Heavy—Original Motion Picture
Soundtrack
TVT Records

Heavy is the new James
Mangold film that stars Liv Tyler,
Debbie Harry, Shelley Winters and
Evan “somebody kick my ass
please” Dando. The film opens
Friday at the Squirrel Hill Theater.
The original score for this ﬂick was
written and recorded by Thurston
Moore, so some Sonic youths will
pick this up just to hear the five
Moore tracks contained on the CD.

These tracks are good, but for
my money they just don’t justify
buying the thing. These pieces are
moody, dark and fragile. Sort of
like something Thurston might have
come up with in his spare time dur-
ing the Bad Moon Rising sessions.

_ They are quiet and sad and they do
not rock out.

There are a couple of other
decent tunes on this album. The
Plimsouls have a couple of groovy
numbers, and Ben Vaughn (who
produced the new Ween record)
lays down the law on “My Heart
Belongs To Only One,” which I was
pleased to discover is not a silly
song or a funny song, like so much
of his other work.

Thursday, August 29, 1 996’

 

Other than that, there’s some
trash by the Connells, Freedy
Johnston and several songs by
Evan. Two of these songs are taken
from the film “in character as Jeff,”
including a cover of Gram Parsons’
“How Much I’Ve Lied,” and a
Victoria Williams’ song as well. lt’s
not so much that this guy really
sucks, it’s just that after seeing his
glossy mug on every magazine
cover in the world so many times,
that I just don’t trust him, or care
enough about him to listen. Call me
apathetic.

The movie itself looks like it
might be good. It’s about some
overweight pizza cook who discov-
ers Liv Tyler’s corpse a la River’s
Edge or something, but it’s a lot
more melancholy. Dando looks like
a dork. See the movie to hear
Thurston’s music, then buy the
album if you need some more.

The last time the Panthers took
the field for a regular season game it
was against West Virginia last
November. The Mountaineers
embarrassed Pitt on national televi-

sion 21-0. That loss capped a nine-

game slide and gave the Panthers yet

»' another losing season.

The Panthers open up the 1996
season at home this Saturday against
those same Mountaineers, but these
teams are far different from the
teams that met eachother last year.

By the final game last year, Pitt
wanted nothing more than to clean
out their lockers and get as far away
from football as possible. After
starting the season 2-0, the Panthers

, vanished and finished 2-9. West

Virginia also struggled in 1995 and
the win over Pitt gave Head Coach
Don Nehlen little consolation con-
sidering his team’s sub-.500 record
of 5-6.

Despite all the talk about records
and who’s back and who’s gone, the
fact is that when Pitt and West
Virginia lock up in what is so elo-
quently dubbed the Backyard Brawl,
anything can happen. Just look back

at the 1994 meeting between the two ,

teams that saw 21 points scored in
the final two minutes of the game
before the Mountaineers finally won
47-41.

For those of you who have little
faith in the Panthers, here are some
good numbers to keep tucked away
for Saturday. Pitt leads the all-time
series 55-30-3. The Panthers have
outscored WVU 1,796-1,100 in the
88-game history between the two.
But the big stat that jumped out at
me was the fact that the Panthers
have never lost to West Virginia in a
year ending in six. Hark, the
Panthers are destined to start out 1-
0, however the game must still be
played on the field and that’s what

beats WVU

When tailback Curtis Martin
went down with an ankle injury
against Ohio University two years
ago, many Panther coaches and
fans were worried about who
would pick up the slack.

The obvious choice at the time
was sophomore Billy West. During
his freshman year, West was the
Panthers’ second leading rusher
with 244 yards and scored seven
touchdowns. With their superstar
Martin down with an injury, all the
coaching staff could do was hope
that West‘ could contribute some
solid running and just cross their
fingers and hope for the best.

West did more. than just con-
tribute some solid running, he

- dominated the'Big- East and sur-

faced as the‘lone bright spot in a
disappointing 3-8 finish.

The 5—foot-10, then 195-pound
tailback put on a show during the

111994 season and finished with

1,358 «yards on 252 carries and
scored six times. These ‘numbers
were good enough for West to be
named the Big East Offensive
Player of the Year. West also was
named to the Associated Press hon-
orable mention All—American team
and first—team All-Big East.

As the 1995 season was in the
works for the Panthers, West was
undoubtedly the top weapon inan
offense that could have been pow-
erful enough to propel Pitt to a
winning season. However, in the
season opener against Washington
State, the downward spiral for the
tailback began.

In the second quarter of the
opener, West left the game with an

unusual ligament tear in his chest.
He sat out the next three games
before returning September 30
against Virginia Tech. In the first 2
1/2 quarters against the Hokies,
West looked impressive rushing
for 113 yards. The downward spi-
ral was complete midway through
the third quarter when West went
down with a fractured leg, ending

 

West returns to lead Panthers

his season.

For any player to sit on the
sidelines and watch his team stum-
ble to a 2-9 record would be diffi-
cult, but for the player that was
supposed to lead the team it was
even harder. _

“It’s really tough to have to sit

The 1996 season may be con-
sidered the rebirth of Pitt football.
The reason for this optimism is
due largely to the incoming crop
of recruits that begin their first
season for the Blue and Gold. The
1996 class is considered by many
to the best group that Coach
Johnny Majors has brought in dur-
ing his second stint with Pitt. Most

breathe life into dead team

publications rank Pitt’s class in the
top 30 in the nation and behind
only Miami and Virginia Tech in
the Big East.

This bodes well for the
Panthers, following a number of
disappointing recruiting classes in
the early 1990s.

Leading the class are a number
of WPIAL standouts that hope to
have an immediate impact with the
Panthers. Heading the class is
quarterback Tony Zimmerman,

who was one of the most highly
regarded quarterbacks in the coun-
try his senior year at Penn
Trafford.

Zimmerman led the WPIAL in
passing yardage as a senior (2,429
yards, 190 of 331 passes, 16 TDs),
earning WPIAL AAAA Player of
the Year. Zimmerman has an

extremely strong arm and is best
suited as a drop back quarterback.
Most likely, Zimmerman will red-

Volleyball looks to reclaim Big East title

Marc Rosenberg

 

With the 1996 season opener
two days away, chemistry looks to
play the key factor for the Pitt vol-
leyball team. The youthful addi-
tions of size, strength, and most
importantly height, could put this
Big East squad in contention for
this year’s conference champi-
onship. The fun begins this week-
end with the Mizuno-Panther
Invitational at the Fitzgerald Field
House.

Last season ended the Lady
Panthers’ impressive string of
seven straight Big East champi-
onships. Last year, newcomer
Notre Dame won the conference,
finished in the top 15, and again
looks strong.

Fourth-year Head Coach Cindy

Alvear looks for a bigger, more
physical squad with 'six off—season
recruits, including 6—foot—5 hitter
Paula Zemrowski and Melissa
Alpers.
, “Zemrowski adds to this team
by the sheer fact that she’s 6—foot-
5,” said Alvear. “[Paula] is defi-
nitely going to be a physical
strength on the court.”

Another rookie with a chance
to .make an immediate impact is
Melissa Alpers. At 5—foot—ll,

Alpers may catch some teams off-
guard. “She’s a good jumper and is
already a very physical player,”
Alvear explains. “Melissa has the

potential to
get even
stronger.”
Also see-
ing action
this season
will be first-
year players
A n d r e a
Grooms, mid-
dle hitter
P e g g y
Meinhart and
Julie Cress.
Freshman
J e n i f e r
Nickels, who
broke her leg

in, March,
will not have
an impact

early on in
the 1996 cam-

paign.
A 1 v e a r
thinks the

added size
and strength
up front will
work to the

advantage of senior middle hitter
Jennie Driscoll.

A SUITE FOR LESS

“I’m hoping it allows her to be
more successful,” says Alvear.
“She was keyed on a lot last season
but may not be as much of a stand-
out this
year.”

Driscoll led
the team last
season with
464 kills, an
average of
3.65 kills-
p e r - g a In e ,
and a block
average of
1.23. She
also has

is no telling what could happen.”

Beware city slickers - the
rednecks are a-certain’!

’z$='«,‘af6°ss<>.o.a-.«».«~,,... ._

   

>

_ Scenes from last year’s Backyard Brawl will -likely be reversed as the

'96 Panthers crush the West Virginia Mountaineers.

 

(Editor’s Note: The following is a
true Pitt fan’s adaptation of one of col-
lege f00tball’s most storied rivalries —
the Backyard Brawl.)

The Backyard Brawl.

For 101 years that term has been
used for the rivalry developed by the
Pitt Panthers and the West Virginia
Mountaineers, two schools nestled in a
stretch of 90 miles connected by
Interstate 79.

The Backyard Brawl.

Remember a few years back when
Panther PA announcer Don Ireland lost
his job for a few game—time announce-
ments like “Someone with a tractor
parked outside left the lights on,” or
references about “A large group of
WVU fans being related.” Ireland
brieﬂy lost his job because of that, but
he’s back, and, as Pitt fans, we should
hope his wit is as sharp as ever this
Saturday. . .

It’s not fair to fire the guy for
speaking the truth.

The Backyard Brawl.

Over the last few years, interest in
Pitt football has diminished greatly.
The evidence is obvious: poor atten-
dance, apathetic students more worried
about punk rock than school spirit, dis-
mal. records and little national expo-
sure.

This year’s Backyard Brawlshould
be different. ESPN has chosen to cover

the game. The game is the season open-

...e-. .. ._....-..... ......_

-_- ---~.....~...u~.......‘...-...-....4.. -.._...

er. Those rednecks that are all related
and go to family reunions looking‘ for
women will be at Pitt Stadium at 7:30
p.m., rooting on the school that we, as
Pitt fans, should despise the most.

The Backyard Brawl.

Pitt leads the all-time series 55-30-
3, and it remains the longest running
rivalry the Panthers have. The teams
have met every season since 1943. It
also ranks as one of the top 10 longest
running rivalries going on in college
football. So the city slickers have a big
advantage over the Jeff Foxworthy
wanna-bes.

, Unfortunately, as Foxworthy’s
popularity rose, so did WVU’s winning
streak in the series. The Mountaineers
are 6-1-1 in the last seven games of the
series, but are 14-29 in games played at
Pitt Stadium.

The Backyard Brawl.

When Pitt and West Virginia open
the season against each other, Pitt is 5-
1,‘including a 34-3 drubbing of WVU

 

 

in 1991, which was the last
time Pitt beat the
Mountaineers.

The home team has
enjoyed only two victories
in the series since the 1986
season. Pitt thrashed a hap-
less, and pathetic, West
Virginia squad, 48-16, in
1986 at Pitt Stadium. WVU
beat an injury-ravaged 1993
Pitt team 42-21 at
Mountaineer Field, where a
friend really is a member of
the family.

The Backyard Brawl.

Curt Cignetti, Pitt’s
tight end coach and recruit-
ing coordinator, was a back-
up quarterback on West
Virginia’s 1981 Peach Bowl
and 1982 Gator Bowl teams.

Desmond Robinson,
West Virginia’s running
backs coach, was a former
linebacker at Pitt under
Head Coach Johrmy Majors
from 1975-78, playing on
FOUR straight bowlteams,

including the 1976 National
Championship team.

Hmmm, speaking of national
championships; Pitt’s won NINE —
West Virginia’s won ZERO.

The Backyard Brawl.

Johnny Majors has compiled a
181-130-10 record (.564) during his
29-year coaching career. Majors has
led teams to 16 bowl appearances. One
dark spot on his resume is a 3-4 record
versus WVU.

Don Nehlen has compiled a 167-
103—8 record in 25 seasons as a head
coach. Somehow, he’s guided those
country-lovin’ hillbillies to a 8-6-2
record against Pitt.

Let’s face it, besides the recent his-
tory (and we are talking about five
years in a 101-year-old series), Pitt has
dominated every facet of this series.
Whether it’s putting players in the
NFL, ﬁelding All-American players,
bowl victories, better tradition, fans
who date outside the family tree, cuter
cheerleaders or a better mascot, West
Virginia has spent its entire existence
in college football trying to emulate
Pittsburgh. If you don’t believe me,
then look at their uniforms. Don’t they
remind you of the Pittsburgh Steelers?

I dunno. Maybe I’ll find me a
toothless country vixen to go out coun-
try line—dancing with and then enjoy a
night of poaching farm animals while
drinking a six—pack of Bud in my 1977
Ford pickup truck, fully equipped with
a gun rack. and several items of ﬁshing
gear. ‘

THE PITT NEW$~

 

IIEHVIEWS

Off with their heads,
both of them!

The California Legislature is currently working
on putting into effect legislation mandating that
twice-convicted child molesters to be “chemically
castrated” upon their release from prison through
periodical injections with a drug that inhibits sex
drive. In place of chemical castration, offenders
would be given the option of surgical castration.
First-time offenders would also be subjected to the
same punishment should their crimes be deemed hor-
rific enough in the eyes of the court trying them. This
would be the harshest punishment ever put into law in
this country for child molestation.

This measure would countradict the edict in this
country against cruel and unusual punishment. It
would be more humane to simply execute a convicted
child molester than to start hacking away either
chemically or surgically at the body of a human
being. This gives new meaning to the cry, “Off with
their heads!” Are we really to the point in this coun-
try where we use medical punishment outside of
death for any crime?

If this legislation goes into effect, it isn’t that far
a step to cutting off the hands of thieves and reinsti-
tuting the racks. Where does it end? One has to judge
what constitutes a fate worse than death and when
have we gone too far.

This legislation is highly prejudicial as well.
There are. female child molesters as well as male.
What would be the equivalent punishment for a
female as, whether the California Legislature is
aware of this or not, you can’t take away what isn’t
there?

There is also the fact that sexual crimes including
child molestation have been proven to be crimes of
violence rather than sex. Whether a convicted child
molester is castrated or not, the basic drives which
caused them to commit the crime are mental, rather
than hormonal. When this method proves to be inef-
fective, is the next step a lobotomy? Are we ready to
turn people into drooling shadows of human beings to
prove a point? California appears ready to maim and
torture.

We also need to consider the effect of sending
castrated individuals into society. What sociological
and psychological affect would this punishment have.
It would seem that someone who has been physically
altered would have a lot of resentment and anger to
take out upon the society which has handed them
such a twisted fate. This measure is problem shifting,
not problem solving. Would the type of individual
created by such a procedure be any better than what
he was before, or would he be even worse? The inher-
ent drawbacks and prejudices in this legislation out-
weigh any possible benefits, if there are any.

Know how and why things came to be

 

I would like to welcome
everyone back. I hope you all
enjoyed your summer. Some of
us begin this year with visions
of graduation in April. For oth-
ers, graduation is beyond the
horizon. But for all of us, a
challenging year lies ahead.

As we continue to ﬁght our
individual battles, striving to
keep our grades up, we face
other challenges as well. A new

' chancellor has been appointed,

and undoubtedly, he will make
key changes in university poli-
cies. The cost of an education at
Pitt continues to rise, while the
amount of ﬁnancial aid avail-
able to us remains stagnant, and
in many cases, decreases year
by year. It is an election year,
and politicians continue to make
changes that will soon affect the
the amount of student aid avail-
able, along with welfare reform
and immigration reform.

 

For many students, these
events are mere occurrences, for
which they show little concern.
Students fail to realize that poli-
cies, whether they are made by
government or by the chancellor
of the university, will affect our
experience at the Pitt.

We must pay closer atten-
tion to the world around us. -Of
course, doing so requires com-
mitment and hard work. As stu-
dents we should make every
effort to reach academic suc-
cess. But success is much more
than having a high QPA. Please
don’t misunderstand me, acade-
mic success is very important;
however, knowledge of the
world of which you are a part is
equally important.

There was once a time when
students were courageous, will-
ing to make fight to make
change, committed to both their
studies and to making a differ-
ence. That is the reason why the
Student Government Board and
the Black Action Society were

_. ' , ' :<g.;.

::-‘-my .:~.~> 2:99  «ha as. aw»

    

created.

It is important to know and
to understand how and why
things came to be. Learn the
history of our university. For
example, you should know that
the university had an interim
chancellor until recently. This
may explain why we are still
undergoing changes in policies
and structure.

We are responsible for our
own experience. Be open to new
information. Get involved. It is
a shame that many students
leave this university having
never extended themselves.
This university has a wealth of
information and opportunities
to learn about life beyond the
classroom.

Take advantage of it. I urge
you to remember that you are
responsible for your own expe-
rience. Make it the best it can
be! Have a good year.

Janera Solomon is the current
president of the University of
Pittsburgh Black Action Society.

When the large steel doors slam closed on your life...

 

Imagine that you are stuck in a metal
box with no air coming into it, and you can-
not get out of it That is exactly how I feel
when I step into a University of Pittsburgh
elevator. Whenever the large steel doors
close with that metallic clang, do you feel the
needtowriteawil1?Ormaybeyou saythe
rosaryinthehopesthatyoumakeittoyour
room in one piece?

I have been at the University of
Pittsburgh for approximately two weeks and
have experienced this feeling at least three
times since my arrival. It might just be me,
but I’d like to know if I am going to make it

to my next class or plunge 15 stories to my

V uneventful death.

My latest experience involved an eleva-
tor in Tower C, where I was meeting a friend
of mine. The day had started dreadfully, as it
is with all entering freshmen the day before
classes start. I entered my residence hall,
stepped into the elevators, and waited for the
doors to close. To the astonishment of my
friends and I, the doors would not close, and
the guard told us that the elevator had broken
down and was being repaired When we
were done in my room, we decided to go
back to a friend’s room and hang out for a
while.

We made it uneventfully to his resi-
dence hall and pressed the button for the ele-

vator. The elevator doors opened, and four
other people and I loaded into the elevator,
under the assumption that we would actual-
ly go somewhere. Were we wrong. The
doors closed except for about two inches,
and the elevator stayed right where it was,
not wanting to move an inch, leaving the ﬁve
of us trapped inside.

By this time, I was trying everything to
attract the attention of the guards by pressing
the alarm and pounding on the door to no
avail. Finally another student reported what
was going on to the guard, and they
informed us that they were trying to reset the
elevator. Ten minutes later, they told us that
they were unable to reset the elevator, and
that a maintenance man should be with us in

Auto trafﬁc all travels one way (toward town) on Fifth Avenue.
BUT BUSES TRAVEL THE OTHER WAY, IN A SPECIAL BUS LANE.
They’re quiet. They’re fast. They’re big. They’re ‘going the “wrong
Way” on a one-way street. And those are four excellent reasons
to look both ways before you cross Fifth Avenue!

This safety reminder is brought to you by the University of Pittsburgh Police Department. I

 

about 10 minutes.

By this time, one of the girls in the ele-
vator was telling us about her asthma and
that she hopes she does not have an attack.
The other girl was lying on the ﬂoor with a
handful of clothes complaining about the
heat in the elevator. The other two people in
the elevator were resigned to keeping their
cool and waiting to get out.

I would like to say I was the same, but
then I would be lying. The truth is that I got
somadthatlspentthe 15to20minutes we
were stuck arguing and attempting to push
open the doors. This proved to be a futile
attempt at attaining freedom from the con-
ﬁnes of a sweatbox that would not let go of
us any time soon.

VV1th all this said and done, the mainte-
nance man eventually came to our rescue.
He proceeded to tell me to attempt to push
and pull some of the buttons on the elevator
in hopes that one of them would be the miss-
ing factor in our dilemma. Surprisingly, the
last button he told me to pull jarred the doors
open slightly more, and he told me to try it

‘ again. The doors slid open and released us

back to the world of the free.

Well, I might be new here, but I know
after experiencing this type of an ordeal, not
to get back in an elevator for a good while.
So me and the other four people set out on
our trek up the stairs to our rooms for a rest
that we deserved.

THE PITT NEWS

  

Silt’: all the people that makes Pitt so promising

 

I spent my first three years tak-
ing advantage of the break between
spring and fall terms to intern or
study abroad in places far from the
city that watches the Allegheny and
Monongahela join forces to quench
the thirst of the mighty Ohio. This
summer was different. I stayed in
Pittsburgh, as a student government
president ought to, and witnessed a
grand transformation. I found it to

H be much like the many Oakland
summer veterans had said to
expect
1 It is that first week of May that
‘ma-k€s you realize how different
things are going to be. After "the

- ﬂurry of activity that comes with

finals week and graduation, friends
head for home, vacation and sum-
mer jobs. They all kind of disappear
in a rush of over—filled station wag-
“ons and mini-vans driven by par-
ents who don’t quite understand
‘why their kid stayed out too late the
‘night before and isn’t finished
packing. .
And then you walk through the
quad and immediately begin to miss
the easy excuses for delaying an

;/entire day’s schedule that are nec-

~

fessary when bumping into someone
;that you haven’t seen for a couple
of days. Sure, you can spend a few
minutes ‘catching-up’ with the
security guards at the residence
hall, but the breadth of suitable
subjects is seriously limited. So
you trudge on through to the other
side of campus wondering why the
old place just doesn’t feel the same.
That’s when it dawns on you
:that the best thing about the
University of Pittsburgh is neither
the tallest academic building in the
pwestern hemisphere nor the careful-
ly groomed expanses of gray pave-
ment which provide that warm cam-
pus atmosphere. Instead, you dis-
over, the thing that makes "Pitt a
1 rich and exciting institution for
I earning, growing, and playing is
he fact that there are so many dif-
erent and interesting people to
T earn, grow and play with.
It’s not just the other students,
‘ ither. It includes everyone who
studies, teaches, works, and other-
: wise fills all the corners of Oakland
with vibrant life. They supply the
..-{energy that makes Pitt go. They are
the fabric in a human patchwork
';':1uilt that covers you in new experi-
ences and challenges every day.

:1,’ This year, more than most,

l

{promises to provide a lot of new

sthings. With changes in everything
, '’from the residents of the chancel-

 

1or’s mansion to the structure 'of the
School of Arts and Sciences, we
can all expect some excitement
along the way. It’s the kind of per-
vasive feeling that makes you to
want to see Billy West run over
West Virginia this Saturday and set
the tone for a winning football sea-
son. Or see yet another Rhodes
Scholarship attained by someone
from Pitt-. Or make the Cathedral
and William Pitt Union lawns one
in the same.

It is because of all this potential
and the promise of many surprises
that we annoy our parents by stay-
ing out late the night before they

Study aroad helps students escape the

Countless hours spent with sociology
Professor Peggy Lovell and myself, and
work in the extensive Latin American
collection at Hillman Library, had result-
ed in a solid and interesting project on
the consequences for women and their
families when the welfare state is taken
apart. As often happens, her original
research plans went awry, so she needed
to be creative and ﬂexible to make the
most of her remaining weeks in
Montevideo.

Her previous studies at Pitt had
whetted her appetite for concrete experi-
ences outside of what she calls the “bub-
ble we are living in here at the universi-
ty.” The first opportunity came in the

 

spring of 1995 when she traveled around
the world with Pitt’s Semester-at-Sea
program. In her first year, Lori had heard
about this program, whereby university
undergraduates earn academic credit for
several months of intensive on—board
courses and visits to ports-of-call and
nearby hinterlands. Persistence and ener-
gy in the sometimes taxing university
bureaucracy paid off with loans and
grants to finance her shipboard studies.
She made the most of the trip, ever
curious about the landscapes and people
so far away from and nearly unirnagin—
able in Pittsburgh. She still maintains
contact with persons she met in places as
far-ﬂung as Venezuela and India.

Working closely with her CAS advisor, ‘

in her junior year, she started studying

/I,

1

Spanish and took several courses on ,-
Latin America. Lori also decided to earn 2
the Latin American Studies certiﬁcate, .

which requires a summer of ﬁeld
research. Well-acquainted with the work-
ings of the University, she acquired
money once again for her trip to

bubble of pan 

in Latin America and in the problems of if

Uruguay, this time from the Provost’s ’

office.

The message from the Montevideo
McDonald’s brirnrned with the conﬁ-
dence of a student willing and able to use

the skills and knowledge she had 

acquired in three years of classroom

work and travel opportunities at Pitt. She .

made good use of these studying women
street vendors. Bundled up against the

Montevideo winter, she stood on the 

street comers of that once glorious city,

and interviewed adolescent, rniddle- 

aged, and elderly women who sold
almost everything from candy to leather
goods. Lori came away with tales of per-
severance and ingenuity by fonner facto-

a fonnal economy with few opportuni- I

She also came face to face with
Uruguay’s more recent brutal past in the
fonn of blown-up photographs’ of the
“disappeared.” She was swept up in a
demonstration by those seeking justice

from the military for loved ones now i
long gone, tortured and dead. This Pitt '
junior had read all about this tragedy as I

she prepared for a public policy project.
She came away from Uruguay with a
rich and passionate encounter with
another place and time. Lori deftly shift-

ed gears to connect with ordinary people '

in order to educate herself about their cir-
cumstances, thoughts, and feelings.

On her return to Pittsburgh, someone I

asked Lori if Uruguay had electricity, “as
if everyone else lives in this barbarian
time zone,” said the usually unﬂappable
young woman. Beginning her senior
year, she is now more determined than

ever to get further training and work in j 2

the ﬁeld of development, preferably at
the grassroots level. Her experiences
abroad, courses here, and her own mod-
est sensibility provide a good compass.
She doesn’t want to make everyone like
us or simply give handouts. Rather she
subscribes to the adage: “give me a ﬁsh,

I eat for a night. Give me a pole and teach ‘

meto ﬁsh, and I eat forever.” With such
energy, verve and intelligence, Lori
Frank serves as an example to students
and faculty alike with her willingness to
“get out of the bubble” through intelli-
gent use of the knowledge and resources
of this great university.

A closer look at
West Virginia

As he enters his 17th season as head coach
of the West Virginia Mountaineers, Don Nehlen
must ﬁnd a new formula for success to put
behind him a dismal 5-6 season in 1995. The
Mountaineers lost some tough games last sea-
son, including three by a total of 10 points.

West Virginia has a solid class of starters
returning on offense, including quarterback
Chad Johnston. In ‘95, Johnston threw for 2,019
on 127-248 passing and 13 TDs, but also 13
INTs. His big targets will be senior split end
Rashaan Vanterpool (34 catches, 606 yards, 3
TDs) and junior David Saunders (38 catches,
682 yards, 5 TDs), who led the team in receiving
last season.

Gone hr the backﬁeld is tailback Kantroy
Barber. His replacements will be sophomore
Curtis Keaton and redshirt freshman Amos
Zereoue. At fullback will be junior Leroy White
(42 rushes, 260 yards, 1TD).

On defense, the Mountaineers will be led by
All-American linebacker Canute Chirtis. This 6-
foot-2, 250 pound senior had 62 tackles and an
amazing ten sacks in ‘95. More experience on
the defense will come from a pair of seniors, line-
backer Bernard Russ (78 tackles, 54 solo) and
safety Charles Emanuel (63 tackles, 24 solo).

' THE prrr NEWS

 

(Editors Note: The following is a position-by—position
look at the 1996 Pitt football team. )

The Pitt Panthers are eager to rebound following a disap-
pointing 2-9 record along with an 0-7 Big East record. Last
year started with promise following opening wins against

, Washington State and Eastern Michigan. The season quickly

went downhill, hitting a low point following a 29-27 loss to
Temple, the Owls’ ﬁrst-ever Big East win.

There is hope this year though, as all six teams on the
home schedule had losing records in 1995. The home games
give the Panthers at least a chance of a winning record, even
though the away schedule is monstrous, boasting games at
Ohio State, Syracuse and Notre Dame.

On offense, the Panthers return 17 of their 38 lettermen,
including seven sﬁters. The offense will be lead by junior tail-
back Billy West (31 carries for 134 yards in only two games).
West, the 1994 Big East Player of the Year, is fully recovered
from chest and leg injuries, and is poised to become one of the
nation’s top rushers. Backup Dwayne Schulters, a juco trans-
fer, is a sparkplug who runs a 4.44 40-yard dash and should
provide a powerful 1-2 punch with West.

Redshirt sophomore Matt Lytle takes over the full time
quarterback duties after playing in three games last year (37-
71, 299 yards, 1 TD, 4 lNT'). Lytle, who edged out Pete
Gonzalez in spring drills, is a good athlete with an incredibly
strong arm.

The oﬁensive line, anchored by junior Reggie Thomas (6-
5, 280 lbs.) and junior tackle Tony Orlandini (6-5, 300 lbs.),
should be strong, returning four of ﬁve starters.

Receiving will be a major concern with an unusually thin

     

 

group. Fifth-year seniors Curtis Anderson (25 receptions for
264 yards) and Mark Butler (18 receptions for 290 yards and
one TD) must add consistency. Rock—solid redshirt_ sophomore
tight end John Jones has unlimited potential and could be the
surprise of the Panther offense.

Pitt’s defense faces a major overhaul in 1996. The
Panthers lost their top three tacklers from last year Ginebackers
Tom Tumulty, David Sumner and Jon McCray), a team that
yielded a whopping 29.9 points per game. Fortunately, the
defense plans to be more aggressive this year, featuring what
Defensive Coordinator Chuck Driesbach called a “pressure”
style of play.

The defense received a jolt when the Panthers lost
Denorse Mosley before training camp for team violations.
Nevertheless, the secondary is experienced, returning three
starters. Junior John Jenkins (team leading 4 interceptions) is
the leader. Redshirt junior Chuck Brown and rising star
Rasshad Whitmill will also return.

The defensive line is greatly improved with the switch of
bull- rushing Jason Chavis to defensive end following a red-
shirt in 1995. Fifth-year senior tackle Mike Mohring will solid-
ify the ﬁont line along with Frank Moore and Jared Miller.
Freshman stud Demond Gibson (6-4, 300 lbs.) should provide
immediate help and may supplant one of the starters.

The linebackers face a complete overhaul with only red-
shirt junior Rod Humphrey having experience.

New special teams Coach Bob Babich’s squad needs vast
improvements, especially in punt protections and kick returns.
Plmting is in the capable hands (and foot) of second-team All-
Big East selection Nate Cochran. Sophomore Chris Ferencik,
last year’s leading scorer (59 points), should be a steady place
kicker. Jenkins is slated to be the punt returner while a host of
players are vying for kick returner.

out and just watch your team from the side-
lines, especially after what an injury does to
you,” West said. “Even if they do well you
feel as if you’re not a part of it. It’s hard to
feel like you belong.”

One injury is difficult to return from, but
West is battling back from the two separate
hamperings that forced him to miss games
last year. After a disappointing year like that
it has to be difficult to come back to the
game mentally. West doesn’t feel that the
injuries will keep him from going 100 per-
cent once the opener against West Virginia
rolls around.

“When you’re around football you have
to realize that injuries are just a part of the
game,” West said. “When you think about
the types of injuries that occur, it’s surpris-
ing that there’s not a whole lot more. You
just got to get it out of your mind. It hap-
pens, but you never know when it’s going to
happen. When you train you don’t really
think about it.”

During the offseason, West rehabilitated
the fractured leg in preparation for 1996, but
he realizes that there is nothing he can do to
prevent himself from the harsh realities of
football.

“During the summer, I try to get back
and rehab my ankle,” West said. “But I’m
not trying to train to not get hurt; there is a
difference.”

West was a four—year letter winner for Ron
Pobolish and finished his high school career as
the Ohio Valley’s all—time leading rusher with

holder on the 100 meter dash (11.0). But the
most impressive numbers that West put up
were in the classroom.

A member of the National Honor Society
and a National merit Scholar, this star ath-
lete was also a hit with the books, posting a
perfect 4.0 grade point average.

West hasn’t missed a beat since coming
to Pitt and is majoring in civil and environ-
mental engineering. The combination of ath-
letic and academic success can sometimes
cause problems for student athletes. With
professional football a strong possibility for
the redshirt junior, the lure of big contracts
haven’t escaped West, but they haven’t got
him making any decisions just yet.

“I can’t jump that far ahead yet,” West
said. “I am looking forward to this season
and taking one game at a time. As far as I’m
concerned I have two years of eligibility
left.”

For the first time in a while, the Panthers
have some depth at the running back posi-
tion with the addition of juco transfer
Dwayne Schulters and fullback Chris
Schneider. This could take some of the
weight off Billy West’s shoulders,_but don’t
expect these guys to take any of West’s spot-
light away.

“Billy West is our workhorse and that’s
not going to change,” offensive Coordinator

Ken Karcher said. “He’s going to touch the ball
more than anyone else on the team. We’re going
to use the other guys in different situations but “
Billy is our man with the football.”

we need to look at a little more close-
ly.
Quarterback- Matt Lytle vs. Chad
Johnston

Lytle is relatively untested other
than two starts in ‘95, while Johnston
is the 7th leading passer in WVU his-
tory and is only four yards shy of
4,000. All the talk about a QB con-
troversy hasn’t rattled the 6—foot—4,
225—pound lefty leader of the
Panthers, and he could explode
against the Mountaineers. Until he
does get a solid game under his belt,
the nod will have to go to experience.
Advantage: WVU
Running Back- Billy West vs.
Curtis Keaton

This isn’t even a contest. West
was the Big East Offensive Player of
the Year in 1994 but was lost to
injuries in ‘95. Even with a broken
leg, West is still better than Keaton.
Look for West to run wild Saturday
and pray for a healthy finish.
Overall, Alex P. Keaton would have a
better shot at outplaying Billy.
Advantage: Pitt -
Wide Receiver- Mark Butler vs.
Rashaan Vanterpool

Butler will have to be one of the
leaders of a young, inexperienced
Panther receiving corps. He caught
18 passes in 1995 behind the shadow
of now New England Patriot Dietrich

Jells. A fractured ankle in the Blue-
Gold game could hamper him.

Vanterpool is a proven weapon in
the Mountaineers’ offensive attack
and things probably won’t change
now. The 5—foot—11, 185-pound
senior caught four balls for 59 yards
against Pitt last year, but he is noto-
rious for skipping out on classes. He
was suspended for the Miami game
in ‘95 for poor attendance. Hopefully
for Pitt, he won’t show up for the
game — fat chance. Advantage:
WVU

The Panther defense wasn’t very
good last year, plain and simple. The
losses of Tom Tumulty, David
Sumner, Zatiti Moody, Tyler Young,
Anthony Dorsett and Denorse
Mosely probably didn_’t help either.
But thank the football gods for final-
ly taking Daryl Cash away to a better
place. West Virginia wasn’t the Steel
Curtain either, surrendering 299.5
yards per game. End result,‘ this
could be a high scoring game, but
let’s look at some of the men who
will try and prevent that from hap-
pening.
Defensive End- Jason Chavis vs.
Bob Baum

Chavis sat out last year as a med-
ical redshirt but has returned for his
senior year in excellent shape and
has been impressive in fall camp.

The all—around good guy off the field
will wreak havoc on the field. Baum
doesn’t stand a chance of showing up
Chavis after missing all of spring
drills with a herniated disk and kid-

Vney problems. I have decided to

forego the obvious kidney and get-
ting the s#!t kicked out of one’s self
joke and I chose to rely on the fact
that Bob Baum sounds too much like
a used car salesman’s name to out-
play Chavis. Strange but true.
Advantage: Pitt
Linebacker- Phil
Bernard Russ

Clarke was having a productive
freshman season before suffering a
season—ending knee injury against
Syracuse. The 6 foot, 235—pounder
had 26 tackles a year ago and has
won a starting job with solid play in
fall camp.

Clarke vs.

Bernard Russ had 78 tackles in‘

‘95 and will be looked upon as a
leader for WVU on defense.
However, Russ was described by
Mountaineers’ coaches as “boister—
ous.” That’s a word that better suits a
child on Ritalin or a drunk sorority
chick than a linebacker.

Clarke has five brothers and
eight sisters while Russ has only one
sibling. Clarke will go after ball car-
riers like he went after that last
drumstick. Advantage: Pitt

 

FROM PAGE 25

Cornerback- Rashaad Whitmill vs.
Mike Logan

Whitmill possesses the size,
strength and speed necessary to dom-
inate the cornerback position, except
he hasn’t shown it yet. He must use
his 4.39 speed to take some chances
and look for some INTs in order to
give Pitt some big plays.

Logan, who hails from
McKeesport, snubbed the Panthers
coming out of high school and now
he should pay. The WVU media
guide dubbed Logan an “aggressive
defender who could knock your
block off.” Whatever, Logan couldn’t
knock my block off let alone Billy
West or monstrous Chris Schneider.
But you heard it here first, if he suc-
ceeds in knocking someone’s block
off, mine excluded, I will walk to the
next West Virginia home game
September 7 against Western
Michigan. Advantage: Pitt

This game could be the most
important one of the year for the
Panthers, the first in a string of three
straight home games. If Pitt can’t
beat WVU Saturday, it could be a
long year. My prediction may not
mean a whole lot to you and your
loved ones, but get used to it because

system.

“I’m just in there to pick up
anything I can and understand the
offense,” Zimmerman said.

Expect monstrous defensive
lineman Demond Gibson (6-4, 300
lbs.) to contribute immediately to
the defense. Gibson, who led Penn
Hills to an undefeated season and a
PIAA Quad A State Championship
last year, shouldtleave a lasting
impression on the Pitt defense,
although he plans to at least begin
the year as a reserve.

important right now,” Gibson said.

Another defensive player
expected to play this year is defen-
sive back Seth Hornack from
Burrell, PA. Hornack (5-foot—10,
180 lbs) is a feisty player who
impressed the coaches in mini
camp. He should provide depth in
the secondary.

In addition to Zimmerman,
there are several other freshmen
who may influence the Panther
offense this year. The offensive line
boasts two such players, one of
whom is the highly recruited Ben
Kopp. Kopp, from nearby Valley
High School, is extremely quick

and agile for his size (6-foot-4, 275.

lbs). He was first-team All State as
a senior as well as being named a
second—team High School All-
American by USA Today. Although
recruited by other top schools,
Kopp chose Pitt. 8

“It was close to home and I
liked the campus.” Kopp said. “The
program looks like it’s on the up-
and-up and there’s a good ‘bunch of
guys in the offensive line.”

Another freshman, Brian
Minehart, should also bolster the
depth at offensive line. Brian,
whose twin brother Jason also
joined the team, has good size (6-
foot-5, 285 lbs) and bench presses
450 pounds.

Two wide receivers hope to pro-
vide depth to a very thin receiving
corps. Andy Molinaro was an All-
State wide receiver who caught

 
 

over 1,200 yards as a senior at

Washington (Pa) H.S. Melvin
Porter, a speedster from
Shreveport, La.,. also hopes to con-
tribute-

The running back position is
home to one of the most interesting
newcomers, junior college transfer
Dwayne Schulters. Although
diminutive in size (5-foot-7, 180
lbs), Schulters is a ‘tough runner in
the Barry Sanders mold, who
understands his role on the team.

“I know this is Billy’s [West]
team,” Schulters said. “I’ll do what
I got to do to help the team. I’m
here to help him out and help the
team out.”

All of the recruits have a possi-
bility to contribute immediately. As
they learn Coach Majors’ system,
hopefully these freshmen can play
like seasoned veterans.
