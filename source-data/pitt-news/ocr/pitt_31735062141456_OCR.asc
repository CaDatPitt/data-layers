~ The Relations Committee ruled that ]

the number of couples admitted to all
Pitt dances at the Hotel Schenley this
year will be limited to 350.

"The committee also laid down the
rule that all tickets for dances, with
one exception, will be withdrawn from
sale at 6 o’clock. the afternoon of the
day of the dance. The ﬁrst College
Association dance thisyear forms the
exception and students will be- able
to purchase tickets for this affair at

. the door, if they showtheir registra-

tion cards. -
No tickets for College ‘Association

‘dances had been sold at registration

this year as plans for the Student
Union hadmade uncertain the status
of the association affairs. As a result
the Relations Committee felt that it
would be only just to give. the asso-
ciation a chance to make up for the
failure.

An entirely new organization was
planned by the Relations Committee
when it shaped a subcommittee which
will be made- up of the social chair-

‘ men of the fraternities, sororities and

activities on the campus.

This new social committee of the
Student Relations Committee will per-
form the function of supervision of the
dances and enforcementof the regu-
lations under which the affair will be
staged. . ’

According to Franklin Kallfelz, Eng.
’33, chairman of the Student Relations

‘Committee, the new group will give

‘work with, instead of to dealwith the
Since the --social chairman
of the activity which is giving the af-
fair -will be a member of the social
committee there will be constant co-
operation between the Relations Com-
mittee and the activity, and friction
will be eliminated.

The Student ‘Relations Committee
consists of: Franklin Kallfelz, Eng.
’33, chairman; John Holbrook, Eng.

‘ ’34; Jack McFarland, Dent. ’34; Eliza-
D beth Cassel, C01. ’33; Elaine Blauvelt,.

Col."34; Miss Thyrsa W. Amos, dean‘
of Women; Miss Isabel Anderson, as-
sistant to the dean of women; and
Walter Rome, assistant dean of men.
There will «be a meeting of this new-
ly organized ‘social committee next
Thursday afternoon at 4:30 o'clock at
Heinz House. All social chairmen of

-the fraternities, sororities and activi-

ties on the campus should attend. Reg-
ulations for dances will be discussed.
Miss Amos and Mr. Rome will speak.

New Welcome

For Transfers

Dean Amos Explains Need
of Different Approach

 

Women transfer students are being
welcomed to the University in a new
way this year. » Instead of going
through.-freshmen procedure, they are
being assigned to hostesses who are at
hand to help them become acquainted
with University customs and activi-
ties. Each hostess is caring for a
group of six or seven new students.

Every’Friday for the ﬁrst few Weeks
they will be entertained by some up-
perclass organization at luncheon at
the Heinz House. Friday at 1 o’clock
-the Panhellenic group i-s entertaining‘
them. Following the luncheon there

-- will be a social hour.

At the ﬁrst meeting of the transfer
group last Friday during drill hour,
Dean Amos, in her welcoming speech,
spoke on the need of creating a. dif-
ferent approach from. that used for
freshmen in introducing them to Pitt
life. .

Both groups are new to the Pitt
campus. but the former have had col-‘
lege experience elsewhere, have en-
tered activities in their former col-
lege and hardly need to go through
again the procedure of acquaintance
with college life as freshmen. To off-
stay loneliness on ‘account of their

, strangeness, as-has happened ingother

 

colleges, said Miss Amos, the trans-
fer girls are being introduced to Pitt
by the following hostesses: Jessie

Bissett, Mildred’Clark,' Mary Garber,
Nettie Gensheimer, Augusta. Herka.n-
ji, Elizabeth I-Ielss, Ruth Kosak, Ev-
elyn Mouse, June‘ ;M_i,l1.,e__r  Rebecca-

Hoover —-—-—--—— ------- -—---—-3g&1_..

First returns _in the. presidential
poll. conducted during registration-
week by the Panther, humorous mag-
azine on the campus, shows Governor
Roosevelt to be leading President
Hoover by a matter of nine votes, as
the choice of students in the Schools
of Engineering and Mines.

In a total of 516 cast -in these schools
Roosevelt polled a total of 210 votes,
with Hoover receiving a total of 201.
Norman Thomas, Socialist candidate
for president in the November elec-
tion, received only 36 votes.

Engineering students are evidently
strong for the old-fashioned conserva-
tive parties, the poll indicates. In the
entire vote cast by students» in these
schools, not one vote was cast for
Vvilliam Z. Foster, Communistic can-
didate for president.

It "is estimated by members of the
Panther staff that the ﬁnal results

‘will indicate the political convictions

of nearly 3,000 students on -the cam-
pus. -

Omega Delta Holds Highest

Record

  . -Seven-Year Scholastic

Leads Other Fraternities In
Attaining Quality Point
Average of 1.498

Although Omega Delta fraternity
failed to receive the highest scholas-
tic rating among fraternities this
year, its record during a seven-year
period extending from 1925, when
scholastic averages of fraternities. on
the campus were ﬁrst compiled, has

placed it ﬁrst among the 19 fraterni-
ties now on thecampus.’

Omega Delta has maintained a
scholastic avera.ge of 1,493 during this

. period, with ‘Pi Lambda Phi attaining

a quality point average of 1.309, stan (1-
ing second. V
Omega Psi Phi, whose scholastic
average has continued for a six-year
period from 1926, although. not a mem-
ber of Inter-fraternity Council, has
earned a quality point rating of 1.270
to ﬁnishthird in the listof fraterni-
ties; .018 points behind Omega Psi

Phi is Phi Epsilon Pi, winner this
year of the Council's scholastic trophy
with a seven-year average of 1.252.

A Delts Lead Four Years

Omega Delta has l_ed the other fra-
ternities, scholastically four of the
seven years from 1925. In 1927, ’30
and ’3l,- when this house ﬁnished sec-
ond, eighth and third. respectively.

Only three of the.§'21 fraternities,
ﬁgured in the average over the seven-
year period, liavefailed to maintain
a.C average. ~-

Sigma. Chi, with a‘. quality point
average of .971, ﬁnished nineteenth;
Sigma Pi, which last year placed ﬁrst
in the fraternity listings but because
of its removal from. the campus, was
11ot considered eligible for the trophy,
was twentieth in the ;list with a. qual-
ity point average of .9411; Phi ‘Gamma
Delta has the lowest recorded average
with a quality point standing of .9272.

Surpass Men’s Average

Fraternity scholastic averages, for
the ﬁrst time this year, surpassed the
all-men’s average, with a .028 high
quality point average. Although the
all-men's average has only been com-

‘piled since 1929, the nomfraternity

 

- A__t_tain “C” Average in
Seven- Year Period

men has exceeded this year's frater-
nity average, which was 1.275, every
year except last, when their average
was computed as 1.247. 

There has been a. steady increase in
the all-fraternity average over the.
seven-year period, as well as the low
and high average. In 1925 the all-
fraternity average was less than C,
it being recorded as .863. During this
fime fraternities. have almost doubled
their average.-

The lowest average made in 1925
was that by Sigma Alpha. Epsilon,
which recorded an average of .52.
‘The lowest average in 1932 was that
of Theta Chi, attaining a quality point
average of .93. - .

Omega Delta made the highest.
average in 1926, with a quality point

matic organization, ' will begin its
1932-33 season with a general meet-
ing in the “Y” Hut Thursday even-
ing at 8 o’clock, according to Carl
B. Cass, director of the group. Be-
cause of a misunderstanding, it was
incorrectly reported in the September
27 issue of the Weekly that the meet-
ing was to be held last Thursday.

“All students interested in any
phase of dramatic work, acting, man-
agerial or technical, are urged to at-
tend,” Cass said. “It is especially im-
portant,” he added, “that old mem-
bers of the club be present, so that
an accurate list."can be made.”

During the meeting, Cass will ex-
plain the organization of the Players
and will give instructions to prospec-
tive candidates. Tryout sheets will
be handed out also. I

president and stage manager of the
group; J. Davis Young, technical
manager; Helen Glynn, scenic mana-
ger, and Robert Barnum, electrician,
will be present to give information
concerning the different departments.

Tryouts will be held in the near fu-
ture, Cass stated, for the ﬁrst produc-
tion of the season, which will prob-
ably be “Enter Madame,” a comedy
of married life. The tentative date
for the performance of the play is
November -17, and Cass expects to
have active Work on the drama begin

taineer stadium to smother Coach
Neale’s West Virginia lads under a
barrage of touchdowns to make the
ﬁnal score in the twenty-eighth meet-
ing of the -two teams, Pitt’s nineteenth
win in the long series, 40 to 0.

The ﬁrst touchdown came within
two minutes after the opening kick-
off, when Sebastian, substituting for
Captain Reider, dashed 56 yards off
tackle for Pitt's ﬁrst touchdown. An
exchange of punts shortly after gave

,,:;’Pitt the ball in West Virginia territory
and Heller sprinted 33 yards for an-
other. touchdown.

Late in the ﬁrst quarter Weinstock
scored again for Pitt after a drive
down the ﬁeld and accounted for the
extra point. 
‘Pitt scored on-_ce again in each of
the remaining three quarters, Weisen-

 

Gelini, who had been substituted for
Luch,-adding the final touchdown just
before the game ended.

This pretty much tells the story of
the afternoon's game. Pitt’s powerful
eleven had things pretty much their
way against any defense attempted by
Coach Neale. The game for the most
part was played in West Virginia ter-
ritory.' At only one time during the
entire 60 minutes of the game, were
the Mountaineers even within seeing

-distance of their opponents goal posts. - ‘
 -A_fter VVeinstock’s touchdown in the

closing minutes of the ﬁrst quarter,
Dr. ‘Sutherland replaced his entire
team.

~A pass from-Parriott to Wilson put
the ball for the ﬁrst time in Pitt's ter-
ritory on their 14-yard line. ' Allen’s
fumble on the ﬁrst play cost the Moun-
taineers three yards, but Parriott’s
pass to Wilson for ﬁve yards gave
Neale’s boys -21. two yard gain. Covey
failed to gain‘ through center, and the
ﬁnalplay a pass over the goal line by
Parriott and incomplete gave Pitt the
ball on the 20-yard line. It was just
another march for Pitt up the ﬁeld for
another touchdown.

Accidents in the second and fourth
quarters of today’s game marred an
otherwise perfect contest. Floyd
Swartzwelder, West Virginia center,
suffered a fracture of the right leg.
Luch, Pitt backﬁeld, was carried off
the ﬁeld in the last quarter but his in-
jury was pronounced not serious by
West Virginia doctors.

Schwartzwaldei' will probably be un-
able to play in any Mountaineer game
this season, After a play in the second
quarter, the big center was found un-

BITS -=-

VVhil.e Pitt was engaged in putting
the skids under Vi/est Virginia Satur-
day, most of the Panther’s opponents
were likewise polishing their ﬁrst
game’s opposition.

With the exception of Stanford
which openedits season the same
weekend as Pitt, Duquesne whose
total for the season is already three,
and Notre Dame which defers its sea-
son opener until this week-end, Sat-
urday’s contest was the curtain raiser
for- all of ’em.

Outside of Carnegie Tecli, which ex-
perienced a little difliculty in doing
away with Geneva— and Army which
forgot that the ﬁrst letter of Furn-
man is also ﬁght, Ohio State, Penn
and Stanford had little difficulty in
putting their games “in the bag.”

The scores for the game of Pitt’s
opponents over the weekend were:

Duquesne, 26; Grove City, 0.

Army, 13; Furnam, 0.

Ohio State, 34; Ohio Wesleyan, 7.

Penn, 38; F. and M., 0.

Carnegie, 7; Geneva, 0.

Stanford, 27; Oregon, 0.

Games in which these tea.ms’Will
participate this week are: ’

-fourth quarter, the University of Pitts-

burgh frosh defeated Wyoming Sem-
inary here today, 9 to 0.

A blocked punt deep in Seminary
territory with Cumiskey of Wyoming,
recovering his own bad boot in the end
zone, where he was downed by.Franks
of Pitt, gave the invaders a 2 to 0 lead
in the middle of the ﬁnal period.

A few minutes later Malarkey, who,
with Vvood, did most of the ball toting
for Pitt, crashed through from the two-
yard line to score. Green was success-
ful with his placement for the extra
point. Until the scoring phase -of the
ﬁnal quarter both teams had battled
on a fairly even basis.

Panthers Take
On Minnesota

Schedule Big Ten Team For
I933 Football Season

Pitt will meet the University of

Minnesota. on the gridiron next year
and will play Carnegie Tech on
Thanksgiving, according to a state-
ment by W. Don Harrison, Director of
Athletics. ‘
Four other games have also -been
arranged thus far for next season’s
football ‘schedule, although the dates
have not yet been deﬁnitely ﬁxed.
Navy, Notre Dame, Nebraska, and
Washington and Jefferson will all
ﬁght it out with the Panthers next
year. A

The game with Minnesota will
mark the ﬁrst time that any Pitt team
has tangled with the Gophers in an
important branch of sports. Many
years ago, a Pitt "tennis team played
a court squad from Minnesota, but.
that stands as the only time.

The scheduling of Carnegie’ Tech
for the Thanksgiving ‘" contest is in
answer to the demands of fans
throughout; this district. Most ex-.
perts hereabouts have long’, claimed
that the Panther-’I‘artan match was
the most logical one for the holiday,
and would furnish a great drawing
card.

The Navy game will take the place
of the Army contest which will not
be staged next year. Nebraska and
Notre Dame are in line with the
games that have-been staged in the
past, especially the Nebraska game
which has become just about a. ﬁxture.

The Pitt-W. and J. rivalry was one
of the longest inthis section until it
was disrupted in 1925. W. and J. ad-
herents have long wanted it resumed
and next year Pitt will meet the
Washington school on the gridiron.

Intramural Sports Program

Begins With Basketball

The Interfraternity Council is of-
fering a silver loving cup to the win-
ner of the basketball tournament, one
of the ﬁve intramural sport contests
to be held this fall and winter.

The contests are being sponsored
by the Physical Education department
in cooperation with the Interfrater-
nity Council, and are to take place in
Trees gymnasium and the adjacent
athletic ﬁeld. The tournament also
includes basketball, tennis, mushball,
horseshoe pitching and swimming.

_ Every fraternity is expected to en- .

ter a team in each event, and other
student groups are urged to do like-
wise. There will be no expenses en-
tailed, as all the equipment is sup-
plied by the Physical Education de-
partment, and referees and umpires
will be chosen from the’ student body
and faculty.

No member of the freshman or var-
sity athletic teams will be eligible for
any sport, nor will any one not taking
physical edugation be permitted to-
play, as the purpose Of-~--13-119‘ tourna-
ment is to promote a system that
will give training to and develop
sportsmanship among those unable to
play on varsity squads.

Those who wish to enter teams in
any event must see either John B.
Dainbach, fourth ﬂoor of the Trees
gym, or Theodore Biddle, 801, Ca-
thedral of Learning.

" A quota students enrolled "in American colleges and universities be barred'
from either part-time or vacation employment seems to have drawn the
ﬁreiof many of our most prominent educators.
Princetonian has gone so far as to circulate a. petition of protest, which
' will —be signed" by ofﬁcials of the administration and leaders of student
activities and be forwarded to Washington. _ _ ’

Among the leading educators who have voiced their disapproval of the
ruling‘ are President Nicholas Murray Butler, of Columbia University;

' B. Robinson, of City College of New York; President James _L. Mcconaughy,
of Wesleyan University; Dean Christian Gauss, of Princeton University,
.and faculty _heads of New York University. ' ~

. Whilevitis probably true that, in some instances, the non-quota
lege has been used as a means of gaining entrance to this country for the
purpose of obtaining emp1oyment—-a situation made possible by reason of
the fact that many foreign students are doing‘ graduate work, and hence

H-justiﬁes such a restrictive measure.

, 1- ' _One wonders what manner of enforcement might be ‘contemplated by

sity employment bureaus in refusing to provide employment for such non-
quota; foreign students, what is there to prevent these men and women from
seeking and obtaining part-time employment on their own initiative and
without the sanhtion of university officials? Is not their native ignorance
of ‘American customs and their handicap of speech a sufficient guarantee of

protection for American labor?

Even those of us who decry any manifestations ‘of “internationalismT’ in
government policy mustadmit that good will and a better understanding
of our foreign neighbors is to be desired, if for none other than aselﬁsh
International good will—what remains of it—is certain to suffer

rush seaspn says: Today we have

. fewer fraternities than in past years.

This condition has been brought
about partlyby the fact that the Fra-

ternity Committee is desirous of pro— _ '

tecting the interests of students to
the end that weak fraternities have
been eliminated and those of stabil-
ity strengthened further. The natural
result of having fewer fraternities is
that those now in existence are cor-
respondingly stronger ﬁnancially and
have a ‘better social and moral out-
look.‘ The" advent of cooperative buy-
ing is doing_much to strengthen our
fraternities. .
