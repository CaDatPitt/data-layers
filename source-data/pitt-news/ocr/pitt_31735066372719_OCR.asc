Anxious ‘

Med Students Worry About Future   F

By LAWRENCE LEDERER

Financial aid cutbacks to gradu- '

ate students in health care profes-
sional programs will increase
health care costs, prevent people
from practicing in- lower income
areas where health care is most des-
perately needed, and make health
care graduate education available
only to , the rich, according to

second year medical student Steve‘

Hasley. -
Coordinator- for the Student
Concerns Committee (SCC), -Has-
ley and other medical and dental
school representatives met yester-
day in Scaife Hall. to examine the

Reagan Administration’s budget
cut of graduate student loans.

For those that oppose financial
aid cuts, the most effective course of
action to take, according to Hasley,
is to write senators and
representatives.

“This is highly a political situa-
tion and we must make congress
aware that there is opposition to
these cuts,” Hasley said. “We must
make our senatorsand representa-
tives aware by such things as letter
writing—every letter they receive
in Marchwill make them realize
that that could be a vote in
November——we must show the
public sentiment on this.”.

Graduate financial aid programs
slated for the federal ax include
proposals to completely eliminate
all . Guaranteed Students Loans
(GSL), National, Direct Student
Loans (NDSL), Health Profession
Student Loans (HPSL), and
National Health Service Corps
(NHSC) funding, according to a
report released by the SCC. ‘

President-elect of Pitt’s chapter
of the'American Student Dental
Association and a third year dental
student, Dave Zug said the most
important graduate aid source is
the GSL. Entitled in Pennsylvania

by this program may borrow up to .

$5,000 per year at nine percent
interest subsidized by the
government. , _

According to Zug, alternative
sources of aid are few and far
between and if one can find them,
are generally too expensive. ~

He cited two alternatives-—-the
Health Education Assistance Loan
(HEAL) program in which interest
accumulates at 19'/2 percent and is
not government subsidized, and
the Auxiliary Loan to Assist Stu-\
dents (ALAS) program at which ‘

Group Takes On   Reaganomics Issue A

gay JOHN KELLY

A new student group has been
formed on campus this semester,
and is preparing to take up Pitt’s
part in‘ a nationwide battle against
Reaganomics.

The Americans for Democratic
Action (ADA), a group dedicated to
the protection of liberal values
across the nation, has recently
founded a new branch within the
university.

This past summer, Anne Leo-
pold, a sophomore politics and
philosophy major at Pitt, interned
at the ADA office in Washington,
D.C. Here, she said, she saw the

“need across the country” for
action against the conservative
trend in government. The youth
branch of the ADA encouraged her
to work to establish a branch here
in Oakland. And three weeks ago,
the organization Creceived official
recognition from the Student
Government Board.

The increasing activities of the
ADA nationwide and the establish-
ment of a branch at Pitt have been a
direct result of Ronald Reagan’s
social and economic policies.

"The ADA,” Leopold said, “is
vehemently opposed to Reaganism
and specifically to Reagan’s stu-
dent aid policies." “-

“Reagan’s social policies, as well
as his economic ones, deem it
necessary to have a liberal group
such as the ADA,” according to
Chuck Pascal, current head of the
ADA on campus. “The ADA is the
main liberal voice in the country
right now.”

Pascal also said that he sees a
need for more, not less, student aid.
Apparently feeling that conserva-
tive economic measures are detri-
mental to the system, he said that
Reaganism is “dismantling the

.government.’—‘ As a result, be main-

tains that the ADA should be an
essential part of any campus.

rt

“Many congressmen feel that
student response to and interest in
government is minimal,” he said,
pointing out that students have
one of the lowest voting rates in the
country. “We want to prove that
these congressmen are wrong.”

To demonstrate student interest
in government, the ADA has co-
sponsored a petition to be sent to
Washington against student aid
cuts. , _

Additional group activities are
in the offing, Pascal said. Such
activities include participation in a
voter registration drive and the

In recognition of Black History
Month, Pitt’s Black Graduate and
Professional Student Caucus
recently sponsored a forum to pro-
vide students with an opportunity
to actively ‘participate and support
the national Black effort.

Entitled “Survival Strategies for

sional Student," the forum
included discussion centered
around such topics as the future
trend of affirmative action, the
need for closer ties to communtiy
organizations and the need for
strengthening math and science
proficiency. .

“The gateway to careers in
science, health related professions,
advanced sociological research and
business, for blacks is math and
calculus in particular," said Pitt
Faculty of Arts and Sciences Asso-
ciate'Dean Jack Daniel, a guest

panelist at the forum.

According to Daniel, achieving
“mathematical literacy” is an accu-
mulative process that must begin
in grade school.

“There must be more math
strengthening done during the pre-
college years, if blacks are to suc-
ceed in the professional world," he
said. “Anyone concerned with
equal opportunity in higher edu-
cation has to address this problem

produced by weak public educa-

tional systems.

' “Trying to solve it onthe college
level doesn't help all of those peo-
ple who haven‘t made it to college.
The problem must be solved early
on.”

The forum was the first step in
evaluating the situation of gradu-
ate and professional Pitt students,
according to Ernest Hairston, pres-
ident of the Black Graduate and
Professional Student Caucus.

“In the future we will be looking
at survival issues from the perspec-

"We plan to hold similar panel dis-

Leopold added that the group

Members will also be doing volun-

said. _

While admitting that the group
is still in the organizing stages at
Pitt, Pascal said that the group’s
twenty-odd committed members
will form a sound basis for a grow-
ing, effective organization, which
complement others on
campus.

“I think groups with similar
backgrounds and aims should

work together,” he said. “I don't
think that activities of organiza- -

exclusive.”

“The tuition for dental school at
Pitt, if you’re in-state is $6,400 per
year," said Zug. “First year
expenses, though, will total about
$13,000 including the mandatory
purchase of at least $5,000 worth of
instruments. This has a devastat-
ing effect on both students already
studying and applicants. i

“Because of their inability to
fitiance graduate education, the
pool of applicants is down 35 per-
cent. Llnless our legislators listen
to us, students from middle and
lower income families will not be
able to enter professional school
and thus this will have a great neg-
ative effect on the health profes-
sions in the future."

Co-chairman of the SCC for
Pitt's medical school, Tim Whit-
ney pointed out that at least 82 per-
cent of Pitt’s medical students
borrow money from the GSL pro-
gram. He said at least 50 percent of
all medical students are aided by
GSL funding.

“The high cost of medical school
combined with the problem of
obtaining loans will force students
already in school to discontinue
their training and even discourage
new applicants. If you can't pro-
duce the money out of your own
pocket or your family’s, graduate
education is highly in jeopardy.
I’m funding my own education,
and thus it is in question if I can
come back,” said the second year
medical student.

Pitt Medical Students Worry About Future

receiving a GSL (or any other) this
fall, and “it is imperative that you
write your. . .senators and repre-
sentatives within the next few
days."

The report stressed the fact that
congress will be voting on these
proposals very soon and that they
“may act with devastating results
within the next week."

“llrge your congressman to get
their colleagues to vote against the
GSL. ctits. If your senator or repre-
sentatiye is up for re-election this
vear,,remind him. . .a vote to cut
CS1... .may cost him the loss of
votes this Noveinber from you and
your family," the report continued.

 . .(;SI.'s provide the bulk of
financial aid needed each year for
your. . .education, and without
these low interest loans, meeting
the constantly rising tuition costs
will be extremely difficult, if not,
impossible."

Finally, the report said. “Despite
President Reagan’s belief that ‘the
private sector’ will fill deficits no
longer funded by the government.
this isn’t going to happen: to quote
Richard Lyman, president of the
Rockefeller Foundation, ‘If all the
foundations in the country wanted
to pick up the shortfall in student
aid, we couldn‘t do it. It is a factual
matter that we couldn’t pick up the
slack.’ ”

  Editorially

  Speaking

It’s a rare,occa§i“on when The New York Times and The
Wall Street journal agree on anything in their editorials,
especially with regard to federal budget cuts and taxes.
While the Times is usually critical of the Reagan‘eco-
nomic plan and would prefer higher taxes to combat cruel
budget cuts, the Journal tends to stand behind the presi-
dent and heed his call for additional budget cuts and lower
taxes. t ’ '

I It seems that lately, however, the newspapers are going
along with Reagan's unfounded assumptions about stu-
dent aid.

For those who didn't catch Wednesday’s editorials, the
Times’ editorial, “How Much Tuition Aid,” argued that
despite standing up to a “vociferous constituency,” the
president was hurting more than students with the student
aid cuts, but the entire nation. The journal, on the other
hand, described arguments like those in the Times editor-
ial as “scare stories,” and called the Guarenteed Student
Loan program “an example of transfer payments run
amok.”

These arguments are much of what we have heard
before. Consider the already familiar tale of the invest-
ment-wise family that borrows money not to send their
kids to school, but to make more money at the taxpayer’s
expense.

For example, in the Jounral editorial, we read about a
hypothetical Office of Management and Budget account
of a family with more business smarts than the entire Wall

' Street Journal editorial staff. In the OMB story, we read of
a family with an annual income of $100,000 and three
children in Harvard,_including one in law school, during
the 1980-81 school year..The OMB says that that family
could have borrowed $10,000 in delayed-interest principal
loans (repayment would come after graduation), invested
the money in a money market fund with a 16 percent yield,
and end up ge — trig a return almost equal to the amount
the government (i.e., the taxpayers) shelled out in interest
for the loan. '

The first thing that strikes us as unusual is the fact the
The Wall Street journal, of all newspapers, used hypo-
thetical OMB information as the lynchpin of its argu-
ment. It’s hard enough believing the OMB and David
Stockman when they’re supposed to be giving accurate
information, let alone hypothetical facts.

Secondly, if anyone at the OMB or The Wall Street
Journal happens to run across any individuals possessing
such business acumen, we’d like to know—our economics
department might just have an opening for-them.

At least there won't be loans for graduate students to

kick around anymore. '
_ The Guaranteed Student Loan program will be off lim-
its to graduates students, according to the president's
proposals. Undoubtedly, some graduate students will go
onto rosy financial futures after graduation, while the lack
of loans will inhibit those interested in the humanities and
‘finer things of life.

“Many graduate students will generally be better off
financially than most taxpayers, and need not receive sub-
sidized loans courtesy of them,” the Journal says. Tell that
one to the graduate students who are sorting mail down at
the Post Office. _

One thing both newspapers will agree on is that’the
future of the country depends on the collective efforts of its
citizens and education of all its youth is just one of those
efforts.

The Pitt News, Wednesday, February 24, 1982

Dear Editor:

I must reply to Tim Kearney’s

. column in the Feb. 17 Pitt News

(“Must We Be So Mighty?”). I
don't agree that Ronald Reagan is
a nice guy, but I certainly believe he
is on the right track. A nice guy, in

his place, wouldn't risk his politi-

cal future by cutting all the govern-
ment giveaway programs. I don’t
know what the statistics are about
federal money, but I do believe that
for every dollar that goes to helping
someone in need, 50 cents probably
goes to someone abusing the sys-
tem. The only way this country is
going to survive for future genera-
tions of “free” Americans is by
being strong, and I mean strong
militarily.

As far as El Salvador is con-
cerned, I personally believe that we

. should do whatever is necessary to

stop the spread of communism in

= this hemisphere. When people in

poor countries embrace Marxist
ideologies, they are simply grasp-
ing at straws. When you have
nothing, communist rhetoric
sounds appealing. Unfortunately,

only after it is too late do people
realize that communism is a savior
only to the party elite.

' . I As far as the registering of 18 and

19 year olds, I‘ am against this too.
It doesn’t go far enough. I believe

. that everyone should be required to

serve at least two year's for our
country. If someone is conscien-
tiously opposed to military service,
let him serve in hospitals or some
institution.
The only sobering lesson of Viet-
nam is that the next time we go to
war, we had better go -to win. If our
ancestors had felt as Kearney does,
about allowing others to conquer
us rather than fighting for our free-
dom, he might not have the right to
express his opinion in this forum.
Slowly but surely, the communist
threat is closing in on us, and
someday we all will be faced with
this decision. This country is great
because it is free. I want it no other
way.

Pitt Students for Life Back

Dear Editor

‘On Feb. 18, I met with Jeannie
Wallace of Students for Life to talk

— about a debate. One of her friends

and two of mine were also present.
A number of reasons why they did
not want to debate were discussed,
including: 1) they felt it would be
more appropriate to debate a pro-

' choice group, 2) since the Constitu-

tional Syndicalist Party (CSP) has
no formal pro-choice plank, I

could not claim to speak for CSP,\

3) as I am not well known, I could

- not draw large crowds and 4) there

was no advantage for Students for
Life in holding a debate. At one
point, I threatened to write a letter
(this one) charging them with
backing out of the debate, and from
there, the discussion went down-
hill. As a result, there will be no
debate.

The central facts are these:

0 Whatever their rationaliza-
tions (and I'm sure they can come
up with a number of logical-
sounding ones), the reality is that
they did back out of the debate.

0 A Student Government Board
member or members allegedly
advised them not to debate CSP. If
they were expressing their private
opinions, well and good, but if
they were speaking for SGBit was

an improper action. It is hoped ‘

. Out of Syndicalist Debate

that the son is and will be neutral
on such matters‘.

school life? Don’t let the midterm
blues get you down. Why not

Council (PPC)?

dents, the PPC serves as ‘a central
programming organization. Accord-
ing to a document from the offices,
the PPC is responsible for develop-
ing a balanced activities program to
meet student needs, developing
leadership abilities and encouraging
active participation. To accomplish
these goals, the council consists of
the following committees:

Pittlntramural Sports

By AMIN GHOSSEIN .

You played football and bas-
ketball in high school. A star you
weren’t, but no scrub either. Not
big-time college material, but
adequate enough,“ thank you.
Now, you’re -a freshman in col-
lege, and the thirst for competi-
tion has not left your still-strong
body.

You never really got into
sports competitively. Not that
you didn’t enjoy working up a
good sweat, but the need to
compete, to win, was never
really a part of you. You just
wanted to have some fun and
stay in shape.

The Pitt Intramural Program
can help you do both. Just listen
to Co-Director Marilyn Ross.

“We’re trying to provide life-
time activities like tennis, rac-
quetball and jogging, but we also
have competitive programs,”
Ross said.

The Intramural Program cat-
ers to the student’s needs to get
in shape (or stay in shape), with
the emphasis always being
placed on fun. Like having coed-
ucational volleyball leagues, or
recreational basketball, where
scores are not kept—just court
time is ‘provided.

But for those of you who
prefer the competitive aspects of
sports there are basketball, foot-
ball and softball leagues. The six-
man touch-football league,
which competes in the fall, has at
times been a little too
competitive. . .

“We had problems with ﬁghts
last year and we were afraid

someone might get hurt, but we
didn't have any problems this
year,” Ross said. .

The basketball league is no
less competitive. Scott Rutter, a
Pitt graduate student and a par-
ticipant in the basketball intram-
ural program and a supervisor,
explained.

“There is alot of pride among
the players, especially among
the fraternities, and sometimes it
gets out of hand. The g games,

-however, are usually competi-

tive and friendly,” Rutter said.
Basketball, football, volleyball
and softball are only some of the
sports that are a part of the
intramural program. Wrestling,
racquetball, swimming, track
and tennis are also included, in
addition to others. In other
words, your favorite sport will
more than likely be available.
“I'd say 60 percent of the stu-
dent body takes advantage of
the intramural program, with
others preferring to come up to
Trees (Hall) to engage in activi-
ties on their own,” Ross said.

Sounds nice, this intramural ‘

program. No problems, right?
Students having a good time all
the time. Wrong! Problems are
monumental for Ross.

“We don’t have the facilities
of, say a Penn State, so providing
court time for over 150 teams is
not easy. We have to fight the
University all the time,” Ross
explained.

So if the lights went out in the
stadium while yourteami was
driving for the winning touch-
down don’t blame the intramural

program——it’s not the program’s
fault.

“We have to fight with the uni-
versity to maintain the fields. We
always get complaints but when
we lack facilities and money,
there really isn’t much we can

do,” Ross lamented.

Lack of facilities or not, the
intramural program has never-
theless managed to be success-
ful. On any given ‘night, the
basketball courts at Trees Hall
are filled with games——the volley-

ball courts, too. The next day,
students talk about their games,
about their transient moment in
the sun, or their frustrations.
Competition and fun still lives
on after high school. Just play
intramurals. ' ‘

Water polo is only one of the many intramural sports available to Pitt Students.

grammed events. Setting up and
operating all of the audio and light-
ing equipment is included in their
functios.

Travel——This committee organ-
izes discount chartered trips to

' vacation areas and various histori-

cal and interesting places. Some
trips in the past have inlcuded away
football games and rides for stu-
dents during holiday breaks.

Entertainment—~This commit-
tee provides various types of enter-
tainment such as concerts, night
club acts, Coffeehouses and others.
Past programshave included per-
formances by the Amazing Kreskin,
The Second City National Touring
Company and Steve Goodman. In
March, the Silencers will perform.

~

“We try very hard to getbalanced
programming,” explained Claire

.-.{Murphy,‘ the‘ chairperson for the

entertainment committee. “We
would like the students to give us
input on what they would like _to
see,” Murphy continued.

Murphy says the PPC is “an
organization of students who put
together things to do on campus.”

The turnout of students attending
the various forms of entertainment
is “varied,” according to Murphy.

“Our biggest successes are with
programs that also appear on televi-
sion,” Murphy said.

The Second City National Tour-
ing Company and the Amazing
Kreskin are examples of programs
that “fill the house.”

The PPC is funded by money that
" allocated by the Student Govern-

} ment Board.

“Ten dollars of each student’s
activities fee is divided between
each of the PPC’s eight committees,
and we like as much feedback from
the students as possible.”

“It’s hard for 200 people (who
work in the PPC) to decide what
30,000 students want to see. We
need a lot of cooperation with the
students,” Murphy concluded.

Pittsburgh
Entertainment

‘‘I’m sure there is a lot of interest-
ing entertainment in Pittsburgh, but
how are you supposed to get to it if
you don’t have a car?” said Ann, a
sophomore at Pitt.

There is no need to feel restricted
if you don’t have a car on campus
since there are many forms of enter-
tainment available in the Oakland
vicinity. Also, PAT buses can inex-
pensively (75¢) take you to other
areas of Pittsubrgh.

United States Steel Building—
The United States Steel Building,
located at 600 Grant St., downtown,
towers 841 feet, enabling you to see
the entire Pittsburgh area from the
Top of the Triange restaurant on,the
64th ﬂoor. The building is con-
structed of U.S‘.S. COR-TEN steel
and several thousand square feet of
PPG glass. There are also shops in
the upper and lower lobbies.

“I would love to have all 30,000 .
of our students involved in activi-
ties at Pitt,” explained Andy
Smith, director of Student Activ-
ities. There is something here for
everybody.”

Student Activities, located on
the first floor of Schenley Hall, is
an organization that “advises all
student organizations.”

Keeping learning experiences
as a key objective, the staff aids
and advises students on the
implementation of student
government, Black Action
Society, student media, fraterni-
ties and sororities, Student
Union Board, Greek Week,
Black Week and many other stu-
ent organizations and activities.

“We want to provide a social
fabric for students and not just a
place where they come and go,”
said Smith.

“We - want to be outreach
oriented and find out exactly
what the students are interested
in doing,” Smith explained.

According to Smith, the Pitt
Program Council is an organiza-
tion that has a good number of
activities open for the entire stu-
dent body.

“They do approximately 175
to 190 events a year,” said Smith.
Still, that is not enough for the
whole campus so there are many
other student organizations that
also provide entertainment.

Pitt’s fraternities and sorori-
ties are examples.

“The Greeks certainly provide
a major social fabric here with
their parties and other activi-
ties,” explained Smith.

Smith feels that the students

are "concerned with their career

The kingdom formerly
brought to life and reigned by
massive Sam Clancy and ener-
getic “Tiger” Paul Auslander
now yearns for a rekindling of
the electric atmosphere that
once made Pitt’s Fitzgerald
Field House a snake pit for vis-
iting basketball teams.

During that recent era, fans
tightly packed the rather small
Field House to scream, stomp
and do anything else short of
manslaughter to help ensure a
Panther basketball victory. The
havoc forced visiting seniors to

i make freshman mistakes. Good
passers and fine shooters turned
sour. Regardless of the oppo-
nent, the Field House was usu-
ally an exciting place.

But that was the past. This
season, despite some highly-
touted freshmen, standout per-
former Clyde Vaughan and a
surprisingly fine 16-8 record,
the Panthers have only attracted
an average of 3.01 l fans per bas-
ketball game.

Massachusetts matchup drew

itt Wanted Dead or Alive

By AMIN GHOSSEIN

It’s not just a basketball game.
Basketball games are played, and a
team either wins or loses. No, this
isn’t’just a game, it’s an execution.
Call it a public lynching. A lynch-
ing of a basketball team. The West
Virginia (23-l) Mountaineers
know. all about it. Their fans are
the ones who do the lynching.

Ask South Alabama. It came
down to playing a nationally tele-
vised game in Morgantown. The
players came out to warm up a lit-
tle at 9:00 in the morning, on a
Sunday. Figured to be quiet, right?
How many college students are up
at 9:00 on a Sunday morning?
South Alabama found out when
the entire student section was filled
with rowdy hecklers. The execu-
tion starts early and doesn’t end till
defeat.

It’s killed 22 teams. The pattern
is the same, the results are frighten-
ing. It usually starts with the
Mountaineers playing a team close
for a half. But the incessant noise is
already sapping your strength.
Every turnover is magnified by
delirious cheers, every Mountai-
neer move is cause for celebration.

Then sometime in the second
half,'one of those West Virginia
clones, and there are about nine of
them, makes a steal, dunks it and
the noose is tightened. A hectic:
press doesn’t hurt either. It just:

"adds to the chaos, to the immense
tempo, to the lynching.

The Pitt Panthers (16-8) will
experience all of this firsthand
tonight at 8:00. And Pitt is about as
liked in West Virginia as bad
moonshine. The treatment will be
at its best.

‘‘I heard they got some medicine
waiting for the good doctor. I’ll be
wearing my helmet," Pitt coach
Dr. Roy/Chipman half smiling,
half frowning said.

Playoff Tickets
On Sale

Tickets for the upcoming
Eastern 8 playoffs—both
the March 2 first round
game at Pitt’s Fitzgerald
Field House, and the
March 5-6 Championship

at the Civic Arena, are on 

sale now at the Student
Union ticket office and the
Field House Ticket Office.
Tickets are $2.50 with a Pitt
l.D. and $4 or $5 for others.

The medicine they have is a West
Virginia team that has not lost in
22 games, making for the nation's
longest winning streak. But despite
the remarkable record, it is a team
that, some feel, has not been tested.
A weak schedule might be the
prime focus of criticism. After all,
the Mountaineers needed a last
second shot to beat: Youngstown
State, got taken into overtime by
Rhode Island and had to wait until
the final minute to beat St.
Bonaventure.

“West Virginia can be beat. I
don’t know if we can do it, espe-
cially down there, but they cer-
tainly can be beat,” Chipman said.

Only one team has beaten them,
however. Marshall (who?) beat
them in the second game of the

Most female gymnasts reach
their peak sometime during adoles-
cence. For them, college gymnas-
tics is often nothing but a mere
struggle to retain the level they
once had mastered. Pitt junior
Gretchen Speich however, is not
the typical woman gymnast. Her
vast improvement in her first three
collegiate seasons has demon-
strated that her potential is on the

‘erge of being fully realized.

“For a lot of teenage gymnastics
stars, their ability goes downhill
when they come to college. But for
me, I was never really that good to
begin with, so I had nowhere else to
go but up,” said Speich.

Hours of hard work and determi-
nation have transformed Speich
into one of the strongest all-around
competitors on the Lady Panther
squad. It is an ironic, but well
deserved turnaround from Speich’s
younger days when she was unsure
about her ability.

Unlike many collegiate gym-

. nasts, Speich’s training did not .

begin until the comparatively late"

e of 13 at the Monroeville Gym-

stics Club. While many young
athletes have set their ambitions on
world class competition, Speich
says she practiced diligently for the
sheer fun of the sport.

“I always enjoyed gymnastics
and working out; I really never
thought about the future,” she
said.

As a member of the Gateway

' High School gymnastics team,

Speich did learn to cherish one
aspect of competition--team
spirit.

“I’d much rather help the team’s
score than help my own. I guess I
am more of a team performer than
an individualist,” Speich said. In a
sport as individualized as gymnas-

$5, it is valuable for a team to have

an athlete as team-oriented as
Speich. .

- Speich did not plan to attend Pitt '

until the last week of summer after
her senior year. She did not want
the hustle and bustle of a city
school, so she decided upon the

a trick, but until I have the right

myself of doing the trick, I will
never learn it,” Speich said.
Obtaining a confident mental
attitude is an extremely difficult
task, especially when it is in
demand year-round. According to
Speich, preseason workouts are

Lady Swimmers Peaking

By Scott DELLETT

It is especially nice when a coach
has the opportunity to see his
swimming team peak at the right
time. Apparently, the Pitt Lady
Panther swim team is doing just
that-—it easily disposed of Syracuse
80-60, in Pitt’s last dual meet of the
season Sunday.

“We really swam well,” Pitt
Coach Dave Belowich said. “It was
a real good meet (for us).”

It was also the last meet for the
seven senior Lady Panthers, and
they went out with a bang.

Amy Jackson, who is not known
as a distance swimmer, won the
500-yard freestyle with a time of

5:09.67. The Newton Square,Pa.
native also won the 100-yard but-
terfly (58:33). Julie Terrell won the
50-yard butterfly (27:30) and also

éy LISA GRENEVICKI

Despite a freshman season that,
by most accounts, was an unquali-
fied success, Gary Groshner says he
felt “lost” last year as a starter on
the Pitt Panther men's volleyball
team.

One year and an attitude change
later, Groshner says he has “found
a place on the Pitt team,” and no
one is arguing.

Since shortly after Groshner, an
excellent all-around athlete,
arrived at Pitt and broke into the

ﬁarting lineup, Panther Coach

Ray Reilly has been calling him a
“super player.” Add another Reilly
compliment-—“He’s our strongest
outside hitter right now”-—and it’s
easy to see how a sophomore could
be named team captain on a squad
that regularly starts two or three
seniors.

Not surprisingly, the easy-
going, quiet Groshner attributes
the honor not to his ability, but
rather to a plot by his teammates.

“I’m really quiet on the court.
Other guys holler and stuff, but
when I do something, I just stay
quiet. I think that’s the main rea-
son they made me captain—to get
ye to talk more,” Groshner said.

» eilly said that Groshner’s calm-

ness on the court is anasset for any
volleyball player or team.
“Groshner has an easy-going per-
sonality and I look to him for lead-

ership on and off the court. A
player must stay cool when out on
the court,” Reilly said. “Groshner
IS good at that.”

Along with his placid demeanor,
Croshner has acquired a quiet con-
fidence that he claims was often
missing last season. His lack of
confidence sometimes hindered his
play.

“As a freshman, I felt kind of
lost. In high school, there weren’t
many good blockers and you just
killed the ball. Then I stepped into
a team that was third in the East,”
Groshner recalled. “I really got
down on myself, especially when I
got blocked.”

Not any more. Groshner says he
now goes into a game saying, “I’m
not going to get blocked and, if I
do, I don’t get down on myself."

As an outside hitter, Groshner’s
job is to spike, block shots and , in
the Panthers’ scheme of play, to
take pressure off the middle
blocker.

“If the middle is blocked off or
there is a bad pass, our setter Dave
Baird will set the ball outside,”
Groshner explained.

On such occasions, Groshner is
usually adept at spiking the ball for
a kill. Though he considers his hit-
ting strong, Groshner says his pass-
ing is the best part of his game.

“My defense is definitely my
weakness,” he said with a shrug,

“but I'm working on it and trying
to improve."

With the team off to a good start,
Groshner said he thinks the Panth-
ers have a good chance of reaching
their goal—~winning the Eastern
regional championships--and
breaking the recent Penn State and
Rutgers-Newark monopoly on the
title. In recent matches, the Pan-
thers have come close to defeating
both teams.

"We know we can beat Penn
State. We’re closer this year to beat-
ing the good teams. And, as a team
we're playing better defense,”
Groshner said.

Still, Groshner says, “To win
Easterns, we have to play better
than we ever have.” Both Goshner

and Reilly agree that the Panthers
also have to improve their mental
approach to the matches.

“We have to even out our games.
We lose when we’re ahead in a
game--we were beating Penn State
10-6 and then lost 15- I0," Groshner
said. “We play great against good
teams and lose, and we play bad
against some weak teams and
almost lose. We have to be more
consistent and play well all the
time.” «

But before the Panthers can con-

-centrate on the better teams, they’ll

be facing league foes East Strouds-
burg and George Mason, two of the

conferences weaker teams, this
weekend on the road.

Pitt has already defeated George
Mason twice this season and they
beat East Stroudsburg the three
times they faced them last year.

“We’re going to be facing two
pretty weak teams,” Groshner said.
“It gives us a chance to work on our
weaknesses."

After going from a ninth grader
who tried out for his Maplewood,
Pa.. high school team “just for the

k of it” to a two-year all state
player, it‘s obvious that Groslmer,
at least, is accustomed to eliminat-
ing a lot of weaknesses.

Ironically, Groshner‘s first love
in high school was basketball, a
sport in which he won all-state
honorable mention honors his
senior year. But not much recogni-
tion or scholarship offers for has-
ketball came along despite the
honor and Groshner, thanks to the
urging of his parents and Reilly,
came to Pitt to try out for the
Panther spikers. A year later, he has
set. his sights on winning All-East
honors.

4 “I have to thank my parents, my
' ‘friend, Coach Reilly and

I . ubby (Dave Baird). If it weren’t

for their support, I probably

wouldn’t be on the team.”
And the Panthers would proba~
bly be without Gary Groshner.

reloads the offense. Like Quentin
Freeman hitting for I2 points a
game, or Michael King at forward
hitting‘ for 15 one night. No stars,
just nine good basketball players
and a crowd that supplies them
with adrenalin. As if the opposi-
tion wasn't enough to get a team
pumped up.

Now open at
424 Semple St.

But tonight, it will be special.
Special because the team isn't Stet-
son or Youngstown State, but Pitt,
who, if it wasn't for a lane violation
call with 12 seconds to go could
have beaten the Mountaineers a
month ago at the Fieldhouse.

“My kids think they can win this
game. They're so young they might
think the crowd is cheering for
them," Chipman remarked.

jj

“We can win the game. We just
have to play hard and control the
boards," Clyde Vaughan. who was
named Eastern 8 player of the
week. said of the contest.

In the first meeting, Pitt used a
I-3-I trapping zone to keep the
bigger Mountaineers off the
boards. It's a defense that has given
West Virginia trouble.

“They don't like the 1-3-1, but
we’ll come out in the 2-3 zone then
go man to man and switch on and
off,” assistant coach Reggie War-
ford explained.

Pitt's reluctance to use the trap
zone at the start is understandable.
The defense is used to speed up the
tempo, to make teams run with
Pitt,'to make them play a step or
two faster than they can. The prob-
lem is that West Virginia's limit
hasn't been found yet.

WVU, Crowd Hoping to
Add Pitt to Victims List

Neither has Pitt’s. Chipman’5
team has parlayed youthful talent,
Clyde Vaughan and Darrell Gis-
sendanner coming off the bench,
into a surprisingly good team. It's a
team that can run with WVU and
can go eight players deep.

“We don't want to get intoarun-—
ning game with WVU, but we can
run them. I won't alter my game
plan because we're playing them.”
Chipman said.

With the knowledge that players
like Billy Culbertson, Chip Wat-
kins and Trent Johnson are on the
bench, Chipman has conﬁdence
that the wear-you-down style of
WVU won't work against his team.

The problem lies in finding
something that works against the
Mountaineers. And that is some-
thing that hasn't been done in 22

rate

ballgames.

House during both games
could best be described as dead.

Surely, the Panthers-should
draw more than a few thousand
fans per game. They have a
good young. team, spearheaded «, i
by Vaughan, who, before com-
ing to Pitt, was considered as
one of the best, if not the best of
the high school players in New
‘York.

Even in the Rhode Island
game, Vaughan’s 24 points and
I9 rebounds were not enough to
quell the yawns. Vaughan’s raw '
talent notwithstanding, the
Pittsburgh fans miss the power
and flashy play of Clancy. As in
the Frank Sinatra song, Clancy
“did it his way." He was one of
a kind.

Whereas Clancy never
reached the NBA, Vaughan
probably will. He has the shoot-
ing ability Clancy never ha<,L.x-5
But Clancy possessed the marrliih
nerisms to entice the fans to the
Field House, whereas Vaughan
so far does not.

It was something special to
see Clancy rise to great heights
for a rebound and then snateh
the ball with a force that would
have opened the‘ eyes of Aga-

or watching him
launch toward the basket with
nothing but air separating him
from an earth-trembling slam
dunk.

But even without Clancy,
there was certainly room for

excitement-——on the floor if not

in the stands-—last Thursday
when Rhode Island cut a I5-
point Panther advantage to Ill?
436 before the half. The Field
House missed feisty “'I'iger"
Paul racing up and down the
court, roaring out the letters P-
I-T-T while he emphatically
shook his fist in all directions.

When the Panthers join the
prestigious Bigiliast conference
next season, they will need a
rowdy kingdom that will
frighten visiting teams. not
silent memories of how things
used to l)e.
