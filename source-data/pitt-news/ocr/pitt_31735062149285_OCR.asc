ously announced.
fus Fitzgerald, provost, will intro-
duce the speaker.

An unforseen engagement out of
town makes it impossible for the
Chancellor to attend the ceremonies.

Fourth hour classes will be
omitted on Monday in order that
students may attend the Scholars’
Day assembly in Soldiers and Sail-
ors Memorial Hall at 11:30 o’clock.

On the afternoon of the program,
tappees and faculty advisers of the
various honorary fraternities are in-
vited to a Congregations Tea from
3:30 to 5 o’clock in the Commons
Room.

Mrs. J. K. Miller, University host-
ess and co-chairman of the affair, ex-
plained, “This tea will take the place
of the regular Wednesday tea, but I
wish to make it clear that all Uni-
versity students are invited to at-
tend.”

RIFLES T0 USHER

Plans have been made by the
Scholars’ Day committee to have
members of Pitt Riﬂes, honorary mil-
itary fraternity, serve as ushers at
the ceremony. Theodore Finney, as-
sistant professor of, music apprecia-
tion, will direct the University or-
chestra.

Aiding Durkin on the committee
are: Robert Adams, C40, Robert

University Oflicials
Approve Plaque Idea

Plans to honor Dr. John B. Suth-
erland for his 15 years of ser-
vice as coach of University football
teams by dedication of a bronze
plaque on campus were announced
today by Emil Narick, BA40, mem-
ber of the varsity squad for the past
two seasons.

The movement launched by Nar-
ick has received the approval of the

administration and the endorsement
of John Downie, BA39, president of
Student-Faculty Association, and
Dorothy Dering, C39, president of
Womens’ Self-Governing Associa-
tion. According to Narick, he will
submit his proposal to Student-Fac-

at the regular meeting of that or-
ganization next Tuesday.

It is the intention of those spon-
soring the movement to have rep-
resentatives from the alumni, facul-
ty, and student body serve as a com-
mittee to formulate definite plans
for installation of the plaque. Narick
expressed the hope that dedicatory
exercises might take place during
the Spring Festival events which be-
gin May 10. .

Narick pointed out that a similar
honor was accorded Alonzo S. Stagg
by students of the University of
Chicago when the veteran coach left
that institution several years ago.

left last Wednesday for a tour of ﬁve
universities.

First debate with
sentativcs of the University of Buf-

Grant for New

Library Boolss

An appropriation of $50 to be used
for the purchase of books for the
University library was approved by
members of Pi Tau Phi, honorary
scholastic fraternity in the College,
at the regular monthly meeting of
the group Wednesday night.

The fraternity’s g"ant, it was an-
nounced, by Howard Krell, C39,
treasurer and chairman of the book
committee, will go toward the pro-
vision of volumes on poetry and dra-
ma, which, according to library of-
ficials, are the most. needed additions
at present.

Pi Tau Phi’s action is a follow-up
to a similar appropriation, made last
year by the fraternity, in the hope
that it would become a -tradition to
be carried out in succeeding years.

Also announced at Wednesday
night’s meeting was the election of
Lea Goldstein, C39, to fill the vice-
presidential vacancy left open by the
graduation of Milton G. Lehman.

Cliiford to Give

Final Decision

On Hockey How

By Bill Mclllwain

Members of the Pitt hockey team
and collegiate hockey fans in general
were waiting today for a deﬁnite de-
cision from Ohio - Pennsylvania
league president Roy Clifford in re-
gard to the protested Pitt-Duquesne
game of last Tuesday night.

The protest grew out of a dispute
between the Panthers and referee
Terry McGovern over a goal suppos-
edly scored by Duquesne’s Bill Vance
midway in the second period. Al-
though the goal judge claimed that
the puck had not crossed the red goal
line, McGovern overruled him and
awarded the goal to Duquesne.
McSORLEY REFUSES

At the time of the argument, Pitt
led 2-1 and when McGovern refused
to listen to the Panthers’ pleas, Pitt
Coach John Mcsorley took his team
off the ice and refused to continue
the game. Mcsorley waited two min-
utes, dropped the puck in the center
of the ice, and Dick Scully carried
it in unmolested to make the score
3-2 and Duquesne city champions.

Earlier in the period, Bob Schooley
of the Panthers had taken a shot at
Duquesne’s goalie Fogarty which the
goal judge ruled no score. The Pitt
team objected and appealed to Me-
Goveren but the referee refused to
comment, claiming that the jurisdic-
tion lay with the goal judge.

Approched immediately after the
game, Mcsorley stated:

GOAL JUDGE IGNORED

“We do not recognize Duquesne as
city champions on the basis of that
game. First, we scored as clean—cut
a goal as I have ever seen, but it was
called no goal. We abided by the
goal judge’s decision.

“Then. on the second dispute, the
goal judge, although he deﬁnitely
said the puck did not go in, was ig-
nored and McGovern, who wasn’t

near the play, called it a score. They -

‘Students on Basis of Scholarship

should decide who calls the scores.
“We tried to get other officials for
the game and were promised Jack
Stewart and Happy Emms of the

AUSTIN, Texas, March 10. — A

The signiﬁcance of the survey is

Local Poll Results

Only 1 per cent of all those

opposed to compulsory tests for
veneral disease before marriage.

While the other 99 per cent
were in line with national opinion

Course For Fall

terest mainly to students who plan to
deifer specialized technical training
until after graduation from the Col-
Fcge.”

The first year of the course will
consist of a general introduction in
which the points of view, general
techniques, and orientation of the
oi*og_rain will be -‘gstablished. ‘

The periods of the world’s cultural
development will be considered dur-
ing the other three years. Thus the
study of l\/Iediterranean life. arts and
letters will be the work of the sopho-
more year. The junior year will be
devoted to a study for the modern
European aspects, from 1500 to the
beginning of the present century.
Contemporary culture will be dis-
cussed in the senior year.

Reasons for the choice of these pat-
terns are that the Mediterranean
period was of “outstanding import-
ance in the formation of the present
.:ui:1iial heri'Lage;” that during the
modern European period, the com-
mon pattern of the present civiliza-
tion took form.

The idea behind the new course,
“whicli will eml:-ody several of the
best features of the recent Survey
?ourse” is indicated by Dr. Crawford.
He hopes that the “student will learn
*=<:imething of the manner in which

the relationship between persons,
movem eizts, techniques and ideas
have tlieir outcome in progress,

tvhetter i.ntellectu.al, social, economic,
or political.”

Dr. Geise believes “the course will
eniphf.-isize that all social forces,
either for good or evil, are brought
about by individuals. However this
does not mean that the course will
follow the ‘great man’ theory of his-
toify." '

Bradford Outlines New Program

For Local Seismological Station

By Lewis Riley

University seismologist Donald C.
Bradford, who came from the Paciﬁc
coast to Pittsburgh with a true West-
ern instinct for action, has initiated
just that policy in the Univer-
sity’s long—dormant seismology sta-
tion.

Announcement of the approval of

improvement and enlargement of the
University’s seismological station was
made this week by Rufus H. Fitzger-
ald, provost of the University.
Enthusiastic over the approval of
his development program, Mr. Brad-
ford has expressed conﬁdence that

have a first—class seismological sta-
tion equal to many of the best in the
country and one of which the Uni-
versity may be well proud.”

Approval of the enlargement plans
ffollow a complete inventory of the
lUniversity’s seismological equipment,
which Mr. Bradford has found to in-
clude several pieces of “outstanding”
value in the ﬁeld.

Prompted by the belief that “such
valuable equipment should be put in-
to useful service,” Mr. Bradford
plans include (1.) instrument repair;
(2) rebuilding of the present tem-
porary vault and adjacent work
rooms (in the sub—basement of the
Cathedral), which will include a vis-
itor’s passageway leading directly to
the vault, and a separate light-tight
room for photographic recording;

(3) Installation of an enclosing

a forward-looking program for the.

glass case, which will enable visitors
to View the instruments in operation,
and a high-speed, centralized switch-
board and relay rack for the rapid

and efficient operation of the station,

and (4) a specialized seismological
library.

Upon completion of present plans,
the University station will send reg-
ular reports to 75 of the world’s out-
standing seismological stations, and
telegraphic reports of important
earthquakes to the Science Service.

The astronomical section of the
Pittsburgh Academy of Science and
Art has announced its intention of
utilizing the University station facil-
ities with a view to parallel devel-
opment of a seismological section in
the new North Side Planetarium.

McElwain, has his say on what has

In which our number one ice expert, Mr. Will

brewed into another regrettable

athletic situation concerning a University team.)

Dear Len:

As vou well know, things haven ’t been too pleasant this year in
the Pitljgburoh end of the Ohio-Pennsylvania Collegiate Hockey
A C 9' '

League. _
“never a dull moment” series.

The most. painful sore spot has been the Pitt-Duquesne
Throughout the ﬁrst three games of

the series, the officials had great dif-
ﬁculty in restraining the members of
the two teams from slaughtering each
other. There was an average of one
riot per game.

There have been several theories
as to why those ﬁghts occurred. The
most prevalent idea is that the of-
ﬁciating in the league, especially in
Pitt—Duquesne engagements, has been
no better than mediocre.
McGOVERN INCONSISTENT

The most distasteful episode of the
entire season occurred last Tuesday
when Mcsorley considered it neces-
sary for the protection of the Pitt
team’s interests to send his boys from
the ice after several apparently con-
flicting decisions by the officials. Al-
though there were several side issues
involved, the chief Pitt complaint is
based on the fact that within seven
minutes referee McGovern ﬁrst de-
clared that the goal judge was the
supreme authority in ruling on a
score, then a few minutes later, re-
futed his statement by paying no at-
tention to the goal judge’s opinion.

While a verbal storm rages over
whether McSorley should have taken
his team out of the game, there can
be no question that the conditions
making such action possible should
never have been allowed to develop.
An apparent disposition on the part
of the officials to call penalties on
Panther players and to generally ig-
nore infractions by Duquesne men
was not in evidence last Tuesday, but
it was there, or at least the Pitt team
claims it was there, in the early
games.

HORNETS PROMISED

At any rate, the bitterness of the
Panthers toward that alleged partial-
ity has reached the breaking point.
After each of the ﬁrst three Duquesne
games, players and coach alike were
more and more disgusted with the of-
ﬁciating. As a possible escape from
further trouble, someone suggested
that two members of the Pittsburgh
Hornets be drafted as officials for the
fourth clash of the Panthers and the
Dukes.

The plan met with the immediate

Conference Ties

Dr. H. Clifford Carlson’s luck-
less or hapless Panther ﬁoormen
will take to the hills for their sea-
son’s ﬁnale, Morgantown, \Vest.
Virginia. for an Eastern Confer-
ence tussle with the late-ﬂashing
Mountaineers, tomorrow evening.

Pitt’s lineup probably will feature
many combinations before the game
is over, for the Cathedral courtmen
are deﬁnitely out of the Conference
race, and Coach Carlson is more in-
terested in ﬁnding a smooth working
five than beating the West Virginians.

Possible starters are, Eddie Stra-
loski, the team’s highest—scorer and
smartest ball- ,
handler; Larry ' "
IPaﬁ’rath, erratic
sharpshooter; Sam
Milanovich, cen-
ter; George Koch-
eran, ﬂashy, scrap-
ping guard, and
frail Mel Port.

Certain to be in-

serted are: John
Pataky, Dan
Vjunovic, Al

Reeves, Jimmy 3;,
Klein, sophomores; "
Bob Johnson, ju-
nior, and Ed Law-
ry, the lone senior on the squad. Of
these mentioned only Klein and John-
son have seen much action, the for-
mer a starter in the earlier tilts and
the latter a regular all season.

Coach Elmer Ripley will undoubt-
edly rely on his most consistent out-
ﬁt——Steve Chepko, rugged, little
dribbler who doesn’t like to shoot;
big Cliff Fisher; goal—getting pivot
man, Homer Brooks; West Virginia’s
best basketballer, Harry Lothes, and
Ed ‘Ossoski or Harry Stansbury.

Incidentally, this marks the last
Conference game Pitt will ever play.
Several weeks ago the University’s
athletic department severed all con-
nections with the Eastern league, pre-
ferring a “free-lance” schedule.

Carlson

 

approval of the Panthers, and Du-
quesne Garden authorities were con-
tacted. As a result, McSorley and
assistant to the athletic director
Walter Good were deﬁnitely assured
that Happy Emms and Jack Stewart
would be the whistle blowers for the
game. Tuesday evening, these same
Garden bigwigs revealed that the
Hornet duo would not be available.
When one of these authorities was
questioned about the matter just be-
fore the game, the gentleman
chuckled and remarked:

“Oh, we just said that to play a
joke on McGovern.”

When informed of the remark, the
Pitt boys failed to see the humor in
the situation.

All this brings out, I think, the
very pertinent point that even when
a possible solution of the problem of
poor officiating has been advanced,
league heads have made no effort to
see that the suggestion was carried
out and Duquesne Garden has treat-
ed the whole affair superﬁcially,
feeling perhaps that it’s just a bunch
of college kids who really don’t mat-
ter.

LAST CHANCE

If the present jumbled situation
continues, college hockey in Pitts-
burgh seems headed for the rocks.
But no matter what the future of
Pittsburgh hockey may be, the mis-
erable handling of the Pitt—Duquesne
games is a shameful blot on local
hockey records. There is still a
chance that the divisional playoffs at
the end of this month, if conducted
properly and sensibly, may serve to
put Pittsburgh college hockey back
on its feet so far as public prestige
goes. It is, I fear, the last chance.
If the Ohio—Penn and Duquesne Gar-
den authorities do not meet their re-
sponsibilities, the problem will be
shifted to the Pitt Athletic Depart-
ment, and that would mean only one
thing, the end of local college hockey
just when it was getting out of the
experimental stage.

Sincerely yours,
BILL MCELWAIN.

Protest Ruling

(Continued from Page One)

Hornet professional team, but at 6
o’clock tonight, the Garden notiﬁed
us that the Hornets would not be
there.

. “Under the circumstances, we ab-
tsolutely protest the game and refuse
i to consider it a loss.”

Up to the moment of the ﬁnal ex-
plosion, the game has been devoid of
the usual brawls which have marked
Pitt-Duquesne games. Severe penal-
,ty calling had kept the game well
‘under control.

SCHOOLEY SCORES

Pitt scored the ﬁrst goal when Irv
Artz took a pass from Dick Friday
and whipped it in at 4:36 of the ﬁrst
period. Less than a minute later,
Duquesne’s McGill pushed in Vance’s
relay at 5:12.

Bob Schooley scored Pitt’s ﬁnal
goal at 2:36 of the second session on
a long shot from the left side of
the ice.

Occupying ﬁrst team positions are‘?

Pitt Grid Coaches We Have Never Met,
Or Doesn’t Anybody Want the Job?

Edmunds of the Phi Gams, Glenn of
the champion Phi Kaps, Young of
Phi Delta Theta, Davies of Pi Kappa
Alpha, and Don Ceferratti of Sigma
Alpha Epsilon.

Of these ﬁve Davies and Edmunds
are repeaters from last year’s team,
Ceferratti was a member of the sec-
ond team, and Glenn advanced from
the ranks of honorable mention.

The team was selected on individ-
ual ability, team play, and scoring.

Edmunds was a member of Dr.
Zehfuss’ freshman quintet of 1936-
37. Bill is a good passer and pos-
sesses an uncanny knack of being at
the right place at the right time.

Glenn was high scorer of the high
scoring Phi Kappa quintet, winners
of the Fraternity and Intramural
championships. He is an excellent
shot under the hoop and is a standout
on the defense.

Young paced the Phi Delt ﬁve
which ended behind the Phi Kaps in
the race for the fraternity title. He
is a rangy lad and a hard ﬁghter.

George Davies was a member of
the same freshman team with Ed-
munds. George is a good floorman,
a fast dribbler, and possesses a good
eye for the hoop.

Don Ceferratti played on a weak
SAE team. It was Don’s individual
brilliance that accounted for all of
his team’s victories.

Closely behind the ﬁrst ﬁve in
ability are Dick Cassiano, Bob Dan-
nies, Paldo Gonzales, Larry Katz,
and Bob Thurbon.

This five is made up of four foot-»
ballers and one track man. Thurbon
and Katz represent scoring punch,

They’re getting rather furtive
about the whole situation up on

University athletic office.

Deep in the process of selecting
a new head coach for the 1939
football season, they’re having trou-

tent on obtaining the vital informa-

had some odd folks linked with the

a result, talking to

TRAYNOR BUSY

Pie Traynor, manager of the Pitts-
burgh Pirates baseball team, cannot
be linked with the vacated football
position. While Pie has not been
seen in the athletic offices, he has
been seen at some Pitt football games.

This might make him eligible for
the position. However, it is believed
that Pie will have his hands full with
the Pirate baseball team, and there-
fore has not tossed his hat into the
Pitt football ring.

Those young fellows who consult
frequently with Frank Carver can

not be considered as likely prospects.
They’re Pitt News Sports reporters
covering beats.

Robert Machesney is another un-
likely candidate. Machesney is rath-
er busy with the Pitt News and would
hardly ﬁnd the necessary time re-
quired for the de—emphasized Pitt
Panther football team.
lVl'cNAIR SUGGESTED

Former Mayor William McNair has
not been in the Athletic offices lately,
but he might be interested. While he
has not been interviewed with regard
to the Pitt football vacancy, he should
be considered. He might be inter-
ested. and if the job were offered him,
he might accept. Anyway, it’s an
idea!

011 “Consensus
0f Student Ilpinion’

CCORDING to an official statement to the press,"
The News editorial of \Vednesda_v does not
represent a “consensus of student opinion.”

\Vc were quite surprised to hear this news. For
we have yet to hear an adverse criticism of our
stand, except that mentioned here. On the other
hand, we have heard much favorable comment,
among students, faculty, and alumni alike.

That does not mean, of course, that there is no
opposition to our stand. It does mean that if there
is any opposition it has not yet made itself heard.

\Vc, who are in the habit of making “emotional
outbursts” via the method of cold, hard logic, are
willing to throw our case before the general student
body. If it is possible to attain such a thing as
‘.consensus of opinion,” we feel that now, more
than at any other time, we represent not only the
student body, but sentiment, deﬁnitely out of the

‘ ‘ schoolboy ’ ’ class.

The Independents

Swing Into Action

TI-IE newly-formed Independent party, it appears
from an announcement in today’s News, is
swinging into action.

According to the story, publicity, organization,
and campaign heads have been appointed, and
plans have been made for a nominating convention
to designate candidates for posts to be ﬁlled in the
spring elections.

Thus, the Independents are out of the embryo
stage. Contrasted with the rather haphazard In-
dependent campaigns of previous years, the pres-if
ent group apparently means business.

Although the campus political season is still in . .

its early stages, the Independent announcement,’
comes as a welcome and healthy development. '

Available ﬁgures indicate that at present the
campus student population is divided in the follow-
ing proportion: fraternity—15 per cent; independ-
cnt——85 per cent‘. These, of course, are rough fig-
ures, which, nevertheless, indicate quite deﬁnitely
the fraternity-non-fraternity ratio.

On the other hand, we must consider the present
ratio in our student‘ governing bodies. Student-
Faculty Association includes 30 student assembly-
men, of whom 26 are members of the fraternity-
independent-dental coalition which swept every-
thing in its path last spring. Entirely fraternity
controlled are Men ’s Counciland College Associa-
tion.

Responsible for this condition is the fact that the
fraternities form a compact group, often, as was
the last last year, win other groups to their side,
and “get out the vote.” The mass of unattached
students, however, are generally disinterested,
lethargic, and inarticulate, having no definite or-
ganization to push their interests.

Such a state of affairs, of course, is not conducive
to a condition of equitable representation in stu-
dent government, nor is it an aid to the eﬁective
functioning of such government. If the Indepen-
dent party can help remedy this lop-sided situation,
all we say is—more power to them.

Public opinion must amount to something. Some
proof is found in the fact that a government
agency, the school board of \Vashington, reversed
its ﬁi-st decision and gave Marian Anderson the
riglit to use a high school auditorium for a concert‘,
after the country heard about the DAR ’s refusal to
permit the use of Constitution hall.

In The Mail

Editor, The Pitt News:

May I refer to Mr. Riley’s inadvertent and inex-
plicable error in referring to Mr. George Wharton
Pepper in last Monday’s issue. Like the report about
Mark Twain’s demise, we may hope it is greatly exag-
gerated.

Senator Pepper concluded his recognized Senate
term in 1925. Many discerning observers felt his with-
drawal to be a great loss to Pennsylvania. But Mr.
Pepper is still the most distinguished living alumni of
the University of Pennsylvania (just past three score
and ten years) rivalled only by Mr. Justice Owen J.
Pepper is still the most distinguished living alumnus of
Roberts of the United States Supreme Court, a high of-
fice by the way, which Mr. Pepper would fill with dis-
tinction. -

Active as a trustee of Penn, a participant in its
alumni and bicentennial affairs, he is a leader of the
Pennsylvania and Philadelphia bar and of the ﬁrm o

all true Pittites might well read. .
