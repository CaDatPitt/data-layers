Black groups question O’Connor’s knowledge of issues

By Julie Sabol

Asst. News Editor

Pitt Chancellor ‘J. Dennis
O’Connor left some African-
American groups wary of his
commitment to black concerns
after a meeting Monday.

The Black Action Society’s
Black Cultural Center Committee,
which organized the meeting,
was among the nine groups that
met conjunctively with O’Connor
to discuss black concerns.
According to BCCC chair Justin
Laing, O’Connor was not very
informed about their concerns.

Laing said he did not expect
O'Connor to have all the answers
right away and that he wasn't
placing any fault with the
chancellor for not, knowing.

However, O'Connor should be
making a concerted effort to
inform himself about these issues,
he said.

“We didn’t see a directed effort
coming from the president to
understand the problem,” Laing
said.

Repeated attempts to contact
O'Connor for comment were
unsuccesful.

African-American fraternities
and sororities, Kuntu Repertory
Theater, Ambassadors for_Christ

.and the Student Government

Board all sent representatives to
the question-and—answer session

with O’Connor to discuss‘

problems black students have at
Pitt and what is being done by
the administration to remedy
them. A

“The university has just not
taken the time to study the
concerns of black students,” Laing
said.

O’Connor; was unaware of
many black issues and his
responses to the questions were
ambiguous, Laing said.

“When it came to the way he
answered questions, a lot of
students were left feeling he didn’t

understand what we were talking ,

about,” Laing said. “He was trying
to answer politically rather than
honestly.” '

“Throughout the duration of
the meeting, [O’Connor] kept
saying he didn’t understand the
problems of blacks and I saw
that as a runaround. He just acted

like he didn’t understand.

Michelle Lambert said.

But some groups disagreed.

Though O’Connor could not
answer some questions
adequately, it inay have been
because such information is not
his direct responsibility, Kuntu
Repertory Theater President
Tiffany Ellis said.

“I thought he was aware of the
problems,” she said. “[His
answers] were vague, but again
he can’t deal with every issue all
at the same time so things have to
be delegated to others. Maybe
others are reporting to him. He’s
not responsible for giving the
students an answer on the spot.”

One of the main issues at the
meeting was the creation of a
Black Cultural Center. The Black

Cultural Center is something BAS

has been trying to establish on

campus for over a year, according

to BCCC member Sydney
Westbrooks. It would be both a
cultural and academic center for
all Pitt students, not just African-
American students, and members
of the community, Westbrooks
said. h A .
When BAS asked O’Connor
about the probability of the center,
he said it was “maybe” needed
and would be an “interesting
component,” Westbrooks said.
Plans for the cultural center are
continuing, and BAS is optimistic
that it will become a reality in the.
near future, she said.
“For the sake of the university,
it’s needed,” Westbrooks said.

Groups debate,

   multicultural

center at Pitt

By John Temple
Staﬂ“ Writer ‘

The pros and cons of developing a
unified cultural center were debated by
representatives from various campus
organizations at last night’s Student
Government Board Multicultural
Committee panel discussion.

Representatives from five campus
cultural organizations brieﬂy outlined their
organizations and discussed cultural issues
with the audience. g .

After hearing the Black Action Society,
the Campus Women’s Organization and
the Bisexual, Gay and Lesbian Alliance
separately bring _up the idea of cultural
centers focusing on the groups, they
represent, SGB President Gil Golden
suggested that the groups pressure the
administration together.

“It seems like nobody’s getting very far
alone,” he‘ said. “I know it wouldn’t be
ideal for any group, but wouldn’t it be
better than what we have right now?”

BAS member Justin Laing objected to
the idea, saying that a cultural center
should be for the group it is "about, not
necessarily for outsiders. “The reason for
the cultural center is not so that people
can see what black people are like but so
that black people can go there and start
researching the things that affected them
for so many years,” he said. “The thing we
are losing now is a group identity.” ' ,

But others who attended the meeting
supported the idea of a large, multicultural
center, divided into sections. One issue
everyone agreed upon is that the William
Pitt Union was not sufficient for the needs
of the groups.

One BAS member in the audience said
the union was not serving its purpose.

“This union isn’t really a union,” he said.
“It's just a place where you have offices
and go to if you have a particular thing to
do. You don’t socialize in the union.”

Five University of Pittsbu rgh law students
took a break from school last week to/
spend five days in Miami, Florida, but they
never made it to the beach.

‘Instead of vacationing in the famous
resort town, the students spent the week
interviewing Hatian refugees and assisting
them in the preparation of applications for
political asylum in the United States.

Marketa Lindt, president of Amnesty
International in the Law School,

democratic leader Reverend Aristeed. She
was just one of the thousands of Hatians

who are currently being slaughtered by ..
-the military government in Haiti which

overthrew Aristeed in September of 1991,
Lindt said.

“When they took over, the military
government started, systematically
persecuting people who were involved
under Aristeed,” Lindt said. ‘

The Pitt volunteers in Miami had to

political refugees clearly explained the
horrific treatment the people have received

Lindt said the applications were
extremely difficult for the Creole speaking
Hatians to understand so volunteers with
legal training were desperately needed.

“lOn the applications] you get the same
amount of space to fill in your name and
date of birth as you get to tell why you left
the country,” Lindt said.

Pitt to host first cultural

diversity essay contest

By Bradley Keim
For T be Pitt News

The University of Pittsburgh
Committee on Cultural Diversity

: is sponsoring an essay contest as

part of its Celebrate Diversity
Program.

The first Cultural Diversity Essay
Competition will recognize essays
that address cultural diversity or
multiculturalism. Multiculturalism
includes, but is not restricted to,
differences in race, gender, sexual
orientation, age, ethnicity and
physical or mental challenges.

The essay competition is a new
facet of Pitt’s nationally
recognized Celebrate Diversity
Program and its Cultural Diversity
Week in September.

Committee on Cultural Diversity
Chairpersonjoe Cavalla described
Cultural Diversity Week as an
opportunity for various cultural

groups to discuss their differences /

and similarities.

Cavalla, who is also Pitt’s
director of student activities, said
the week is a way for groups to
“showcase, show off, talk about
and educate people [about their
culture, and] to bring people
closer together and understand,”
Cavalla said.

Cavalla added that Cultural
Diversity Week is also a way to
keep people from being afraid of
cultural differences.

Barbara Mellix, a member of
the Committee on Cultural Diver-
sity and an assistant to the dean
of the College of Arts and Sciences,
said the essay competition is a
way for students to take part in
the dialogue on multiculturalism.

Mellix said the essay will give
students concerned with cultural
diversity a chance to “talk about
it in a meaningful way.”
Multiculturalism is a somewhat
new term, and Mellix said the
competition could be a way to
help define what it is.

Engineers week tests
Pitt staaents’ ability

By Matt Major
For the Pitt News

Representatives from the Chemical Engineering Department
were the winners in the latest Engineers Week event — the
ingenuity contest.

The contest featured six teams, each representing a different
department of the School of Engineering. The challenge posed
to each team was to transport ping-pong balls from a starting
point on one table to a receptacle on another using a machine
designed and built by the students.

The contest was an exercise in the conversion of theoretical
knowledge into practical application. “It’s a battle of the
brains,”, said Engineering Student Cabinet Assistant Treasurer
Chris Cunningham. _

The winning design featured a segmented folding apparatus.
It started out folded up, then a student pushed it over, making
it unfold rapidly, using its momentum upon unfolding to propel
the balls along a track leading right to the receptacle.

Engineers Week is sponsored yearly by the School of
Engineering and sets up friendly competition between the
various departments within the school. It is a week-long agenda
of events and contests culminating in the Engineers Week
Parade featuring ﬂoats built by the students. This is the School
of Engineering’s biggest event of the year. .

“Most professors cancel tests for the week,” he said.

. THE P1'1jlf,_1‘Tl_iW.S....1fhr,_rrsday, April, 2,1992

By Donna Pesansky
Staff‘ Writer

Every six minutes a women is raped in
the United States. Out of those, 90 percent
aredate rapes. So ‘how do women avoid
becoming a statistic?

According to Robin \X/arshaw in her
book, I Never Called It Rape, there are
several things women can do to help
avoiddate rape.

Stay away from the wrong kind of man
and the wrong place. Although rape is
never the victim’s fault, she does suggest
ways for a woman to avoid setting herself
up. _
The wrong kind of man is not easy to
identify at first, Warshaw said. He may
appear friendly and caring, but a woman
always has to be on her guard.

\X/arshaw said‘ to look out for
men who posses the following
characteristics: -

'-He is emotionally abusive through

_ insults, belittling comments, ignoring

opinions or acting sulkily or angry when
his partner initiates an action or idea.

-He talks negatively about women in
general.

OI-_le drinks heavily, uses drugs or’ tries
to get his partner intoxicated.

0 He is physically violent with his partner
or others, even if it’s just grabbing and
pushing to get his way.

-He doesn’t view his partner as an_

equal, either because he’s older or because
he sees himself as smarter or socially
superior.

According to Warshaw, a woman is just
as important as who sheis ‘with.

“An assault is most likely to happen in
an isolated spot, ‘’ she said.

Parked cars and dorm rooms are
dangerous settings, Warshaw said. For
first dates she recommended that women
insist on going to a public place, such as

a restaurant or movie theater.

“Women do not cause acquaintance
rape; acquaintance rapists do,” she said.
In order to reduce risk, anti-rape counselors
and experts have established guidelines
and behaviors women should follow.

“You have the right to set sexual limits
and to communicate those limits. Know
what your limits are before engaging in
sexual activity, and tell your partner clearly.
If you let them guess what you want, you
may get hurt,” Warshaw said.

Kathleen Kelleher of Pitt’s Counseling
Center also offered some suggestions for
women to protect themselves from date
rape.

-Stay sober. K_elleher said over half of
the date rapes committed are alcohol-
related. She said the best way for a woman
to stay in control is not to lose touch with
what’s happening around her.

-Find out about a new date. Kelleher
said a woman should double date to learn

  How to avoid becoming a victim of rape. A

about the man in a safe way. A woman
should talk about the date plans beforehand
and should not leave a bar or party with
someone she has just met. _

-Remain in control. A woman should
pay her own way or work out a way so that
the date is not interpreted as a transaction
in which she “owes” him, Kellehersaid.

-A woman should take care of herself;
Kelleher said women should take -self-
defense courses before they need them.
The Student Government Board safety
committee has offered several seminars,
and a course will be offered 'next
term.

0A woman should trust her feelings.
Kelleher said a woman should believe her

inner warning signals about a person or a

situation, then stay away.

Warshaw said women should be
assertive. She said women should ‘state
what they really want and what they are
really feeling.

Elevator p

By Gregory Rea
Staff‘ Writer‘

lt’s S p.m. on-Wednesday, and
students are slowly returning from

. class and dinner to relax in the

comforts of their own Towers
dorm rooms.

They pass the security desk
and approach the elevators only
to find that two out of the three"
elevators are out of service. The
wait begins, and 15 minutes later
12 to. 14 students jam into the car
as many others still wait outside.

“Since Christmas break there’s
been at least one broken every
day,” said Matthew Hollen, a
resident of Tower C.

This isn’t just a Tower C
problem; this problem is
indicative of every Tower.

“At least one doesn’t work every
day,” said Chad Tomshack, a
Tower B resident. “The elevators
are also slow to get to the ground
level of our tower.” .

HATR

S

“They break down at least three
times a week, occasionally even
more,” said Joseph Harms, a
resident of Tower A. “I feel bad
for someone who lives on the
18th floor. At least I only have to
walk up seven ﬂights of steps.”

The elevator system, built in -

1963, was state-of-the-art
technology at the time, but in
1992 the system is suffering the
strain of time, frequent usage and
student abuse. _

“Our rule of thumb is that two
operating cars is acceptable
during the off hours [After 5 p.m.].
If we have two cars out of service,
then we have a standing policy to
call the elevator repair company.
It doesn’t- matter why they're
down; we just call them,” said
Robert Hopkins, the interim
director of Pitt’s Housing and
Food Services.

Hopkins said the elevators
usually go down for one of three
different reasons. First, they tend

roblems de

to build up too much heat because
of the frequent use. As with many
other electrical systems, the
elevators shut down to avoid an
electrical shortage. The automatic
fail-safe system kicks in, and the
car shuts down and returns to the
lobby area.

Secondly, the electrical sensory
system goes off line. This means
that the system cannot find the

exact location of the car, and as a .

result the system shuts down one
or two cars. This also happens
during frequent—user times

The last problem is the result of
students’ abuse of the elevators.
Hitting the control panel,
disabling the call buttons, kicking
the doors and other rough
behaviors can result in the

— elevators’ shutting down.

Vandalism repairs are also very
expensive. Hopkins explained
that the minimum bill for a repair
call after five is $200 because of
overtime, transportation and other
expenses. In cases of vandalism,
the bill increases because
repairmen have to come in and
determine why the system shut
down. Often the repairs are
extensive, and on occasion the
repairs call for an entire team to
come out and work on the
elevators. ’

If the elevator stalls while
passengers are in it, the housing
office has a very specific set of
guidelines for helping students.
In most cases the students can
get out by themselves or be help-
ed by employees of the housing
office. In the case where a student

lay Towers residents

is trapped, the elevator—repair .

service is automatically called.
“Our first concern is to protect
the individual,” Hopkins said. “We
have people on the location who’
can help to get people out, and if

they can't, the service people are _

called in. In any breakdown we
automatically determine if the
service is crucial to the needs and

safety of the residence.”

Hopkins emphasized that the
elevators undergo state inspection

and numerous inspections by '

Schendler Elevators, the company
that is contracted for repairing
the Towers’ elevator system. The
inspections include visual and
operational checks, and,‘ if
necessary, repairs, adjustments
and replacements are made’ to
the system.

“We won’t go back! March for

this Saturday's march on
Washington, sponsored by the

Holly Callender, co-president
of the Campus Women’s

‘to let the nation in general and
the politicians who are running

for offices know that women and
men refuse to allow abortion
rights to be taken away.

NOW is projecting an
attendance ranging from 500,000
to 1 million men and women.

There are ﬁve buses leaving

the state has the strictest anti-
abortion laws in the country,
Callender said.

To have an abortion performed
in the state of Pennsylvania a
woman has to wait 24 hours
before it is done in case she
decides to change her mind.
During the woman's consultation
with her doctor before the
procedure takes place, the doctor
is required to inform the woman
of the embryonic development
and discuss alternative options
with her other than what she has
chosen, Callender said.

After the initial meeting with
the doctor a woman must wait 24
hours before proceeding.

“This makes it difficult for
women who aren’t from big cities
because this may entail a lot of
traveling,” Callender said.

The Pennsylvania laws also
require anyone under the age of
18 to have parental consent or to
at least notified her parents.

If a woman is married, she is i

required to have spousal
approval.

Singers ease racial tensions

By Christine Hanna

News Assistant

Dr. David Lazerson, “Dr. Laz,” and Richard Green, both
winners of New York City’s Unity Award, will be speaking
Friday night in Dining Room A in the William Pitt Union for the
Jewish student group Chabad House.

Dr. Laz, a ChasidicJew, and Green, an African-American, will
be talking about their efforts to bridge the gap between the.
Jewish and African-American communities. '

Both of the men live in Crown Heights in Brooklyn, NY
where they have seen many tensions between the two ‘groups
‘recently.

According to Sara Weinstein of Chabad House, there was an
accident where a Jewish driver hit a young African-American
boy in Crown Heights. The black community then killed a
Jewish man in revenge. A '

Lazerson and Green have been trying to heal the wounds at
the meetings of the two communities that were made mandatory
under NYC’s Mayor Dinkins’ administration. ' I .

“It is working. It has brought a lot of people together,”
Weinstein said. ' ' _

Jewish students felt it was time to address the relationship
between African-Americans and Jews, Weinstein said.

Lazerson is the director of Project CURE, Communication
Understanding Respect and Education.

This year, Dr. Laz won the John Sidnay’s Peace
Prize.

Green is the director of the Crown Heights Youth Collective.

African-Americans was also
discussed. According to Laing, 70
percent of blacks at Pitt do not
graduate in five years, compared
to approximately 40 percent of
white students.

More should be done to help
black students finish their
education, and the difference in
graduation rates, proves that
drastic changes need to occur at
Pitt, Westbrooks said.

Other issues discussed included
the low number of black faculty
members, the lack of‘financial
aid for African-American students,
the need for year-long cultural-
diversity programs and thetension
between black and white students
on campus. '

Laing said there were some
positive aspects to the meeting.

O’Connor agreed with the
student groups that there is a
need to promote cultural diversity
year round and that there is in
fact racial tension between blacks
and whites on campus. Simply
addressing the issue of the
proposed Black Cultural Center
and giving hope that it can be
approved is a success, Laing said.

The meeting‘ cannot be
classified as positive or negative,
Ellis said, simply informational.

“He knows where we're comin g

“A lot of us did get a true

Program outlines job
‘ possibilities for recent
grads in law, politics  

By Katie Kaminski
Sla_[f Writer

The job potential for college graduates
in law and politics was the topic of a panel
discussion sponsored by Pi Sigma Alpha
and the Pre—Law Society on Wednesday.

Panelist Anthony Leech, esquire, said
enrollment for law school was up 130
percent in 1991, making it very competitive
for-applicants. He said the average Pitt
Law School student has a grade—point
average of 3.3 and a Law-SAT score in the

. 84th percentile. He said law school entrance
boards weight undergraduate grades, LSAT
scores and other work experience and
activities equally.

Leech said that while getting accepted
into law school may be difﬁcult, a career

' as a lawyer is an interesting profession
because there is always something
happening. ‘ .

“When you pick up the phone, you
never know if it’s a mundane or an exotic
problem,” he said.

John Maskaly, a corporate and estate tax

‘ paralegal, said paralegals do much of the

same work an attorney does, under
supervision of the attorney. He said they
also lighten an attorney’s work load and
lessen the client's costs by assisting the
attorney in doing research and drawing
up legal paperwork.

“Paralegals are a good business
investment for law ﬁrms,” he said.

The paralegal profession is the fastest-
growing field in the United States, and it is
also a very aggressive field.

“You must be able to handle many
projects at once andbe able to work under
pressure,” he said.

“Wallﬂowers will not survive in this job.”

Brian Ripley, assistant professor of
political science at Pitt, told students
consideringgraduate school, “Grad school
is not a place to hang out unless youknow
what you want to do. To get a Ph.D. is an
investment of time and resources."

Ripley said, “Graduate school has serious
hurdles. Somewhere along the way, a
comprehensive exam must be taken, and
a degree culminates with a dissertation.”
He said that graduate school is not all
brains; it is also an endurance test.

was being persecuted because of their

visibility under Aristeed,” Lindt said.

Lindt gave an example of a man who
was politically active under Aristeed
and was warned one night while walking
home that soldiers were at his house.
The man ﬂed to the wilderness for
refugee and discovered weeks later
that his friend had been at the house
when soldiers came. The soldiers
mistakenly arrested the man’s friend in
his place. His friend was badly beaten
and then imprisoned until the soldiers
realized they were holding the wrong
man and set him free.

Scott Jeffries, a third—year Pitt law
student, said he wrote applications for
refugees who were in fear for their lives
only because they organized cqmmunity
projects to build better roads or a new
town hall.

“I talked to some people who were
just members of a church and they were
persecuted for that reason,” Jeffries
said.

He also told about people who were
arrested for listening to a radio hidden
in a man’s house which would broadcast
programs in English. These people
escaped to spend three days on a
twelve-foot boat with 50 other refugees
attempting to sail to a country where
their lives would not be threatened
because of such unjustifiable reasons
as community improvement or listening
to aradio program, Jeffries said.

The Pitt law students had to listen to
a translator tell these stories of
persecution then put them in print on
the application and hope the judicial
board would think the danger was

significant enough to allow the refugee
to stay.

Jeffries stressed the fact that the
refugees were self-sufficient working
Haitians who didn’t leave for economic
reasons as many Americans believe.

“They didn't come here because they
didn’t like it in Haiti, they came because
they feared for their lives,” Jeffries
said.

He said he prepared an application ,
for one man who was a carpenter in-

Haiti with a family and a’ proﬁtable
practice established. ’

The man told Jeffries he had to leave P ’

all that behind because soldiers were
killing young men who were not
involved in the army, these men were
assumed to be rebels scheming against

. the army.

“He had built his own house, he was
very proud of his house and he had to
leave it,” Jeffries said. '

According to Lindt, there are currently
1800 refugees who have been permitted
to enter the country and are waiting to
ﬁle applications for asylum in hopes
they will be approved for green cards.
Thousands more were never permitted
to enter the country and were sent
back to Haiti by Coast Guard screening
ships that intercedethe refugee boats,
question the people aboard and decide
to either let them into the country or
send them away, Lindt said.

She explained thatthe interview and
application process takes so much time‘
that out of the 1800 refugees waiting in

Miami, only ten have appeared before ,

a judicial board, and so far, only one
refugee has been granted a green
card. '

fMm~cbfo1~ women’s rights

On Sunday, April 5, hundreds of thousands of American
women and men will march in the nation’s capital for a
woman’s right to choose an abortion and an end to
oppression against women. The April 5 Freedom of
Choice March or March for Women’s Lives will sound an
all-out effort to mobilize pro-choice, pro-woman America.

.The National Organization for Women, along with

representatives from 520 campuses across the country,
will lead a march for abortion rights and reproductive
rights and plan the event to launch a massive campaign
to break through the glass ceiling and elect women and
women's-rights supporters to state legislatures, Congress
and even the White House.

This march is necessary. ,,

In relation to abortion rights, the Supreme Court is set
to overturn a basic freedom: a right to choose an abortion.
The Supreme Court is packed with conservative ideologues
willing to allow the "government to override a reasonable.

A person’s expectation to bodily integrity and privacy.

In relation to civil rights, the Supreme Court has gutted

.‘ civil-rights decisions guaranteeing equal opportunity for

women and minorities. Action must be taken immediately

A to prevent further injustices against women and all

oppressed peoples.

Sexual violence against women is a national epidemic.
Estimates indicate one in four women will be sexually
assaulted in her lifetime.

’ Remember that of the 435 Congressional representatives,
28, are women and another is a non—voting member. Out
of the 100 U.S. Senators, two are women. A demonstration
is called for. According to findings by USA Today, these
women, Democrats and Republicans, face frustration and
sexual harassment in the halls of the phallus. Injustice can

I be perpetrated when women are left out of the decision-
‘ making game. ‘

The Irish government’s denial of the 14-year-old,
pregnant, rape survivor's right to travel to England for an
abortion isa haunting _reminder to millions ‘of women.
Illegal-abortion advocates want to return to the days
when women risked their lives through back-alley
abortions. N o matter how often illegal-abortion advocates
misrepresent the issue, death from illegal abortion was a
reality before the Supreme Court decrirriinalized abortion
in the Roe 2/. Wade decision. T

According to Kate Michelman, president of National
Abortion Rights Action League: “The Freedom of Choice
March will demonstrate the power, determination and

diversity of America's pro-choice majority. The faces in
Washington April 3 will be faces ofpro—choice America —
grandmothers who remember the backalleys, women
who have withstood anti-choice harassment, families that
have chosen abortion, students who have faced crisis

pregnancies, men whose mothers and sisters have suffered"

and died from illegal abortion and Americans who care
about our nation’s future.”

University virgins few oz?/zlclfozr between

Some of the more impossible tasks in life include
fitting a square peg into a round hole, finding an
electable Democratic presidential candidate and
making it through college with your virginity still
intact.

Focusing on the square peg idea would make for

sexually active. When these others enter ‘into -a
relationship, they expect sex to be a part of it.
This area poses the most trouble. Odds are that
the virgin will meet someone who is sexually
active. If a relationship ensues, sexual pressure will
heighten. Soon there is a conﬂict between principles

- Most of the time,
-. , abstinence is abandoned and the

not easy, and the person’s life is

In our changing society, which
is becoming more sexually active, the number of
students who. go to college as virgins is falling. High
school is the time for most first intercourse
experiences, though others are already active in
junior high school or sooner. The sexually inactive
teenager is a rarity.

This drop in the number of teenage virgins gives
way to a self~fulﬁlling prophecy: Most people agree
there is strength in numbers. If the people around
you are having sex, it becomes difficult to stay
away. As time progresses, more teenagers will
choose to become active sooner.

In most cases, there is no immediate evidence of
a problem with sexual activity. Unless a teenager
has a friend who has been pregnant or who has
impregnated someone, there is no sense of danger
about having sex. So what about the person who
has decided not to have sex until marriage?

Unfortunately, the odds are not in this person’s
favor. There has been a natural upward movement
of marital age due to continuing education. While

the person must wait longer for marriage, there are

all sorts of physiological processes that can make
a person want to have sex. The person’s mind must
win over the desires of the body.

There is a common need for companionship
among all people. The person who wants to stay a
virgin is no different. When this person looks for
others to date, there emerges a distinct problem: An

It is almosttunfair that relationships work that
way. A virgin must search high and low to find
another virgin. Even though they share that quality,
the other complexities of "relationships must be
addressed, and there is a real good chance the two
people are not compatible. The dating pool is
awfully small for the virgin.

Is anyone at fault for makingithings so hard on
virgins? The blame could be on the virgin for
holding on to old-fashioned, idealistic notions.
Sexually active people could be blamed, for
pressuring virgins into having sex. What about the
sexually permissive college environment?

During the college years, men and women have
traditionally put away the things of childhood and
become adults --— idealistic notions fall in the face

. of scientific practicality. The facade of innocence is

stripped away, and a new person emerges.

No matter what ideas you bring with you to
college, they all fail when challenged by an amoral
intellectual. Ifyou try to hold on to your own ideas,
you have littlechance for success. In the end, most
everyone has the same ideas.

Gymnastics places fourth at ECAC meet

Pitt hosts ‘Ultimate Force’

By Tom Schneider
Stajf Writer ‘ 9

On Sunday, April five at Trees Hall, Pitt
will host the fourth annual “Ultimate Force”
physical skills exhibition. It is a yearly
extravaganza put on by the East-West
Martial Arts Club, Club President"Robert
Copechal and former Pitt football player
and Martial Arts Hall—of-Famer, Curtis
Smith. Proceeds from the event benefit
the Champions Association Inc. Youth
Programs.

The “Ultimate Force” is intended to
provide a positive example for area
children showing them the importance of
a drug—free lifestyle.

Many tickets are donated every year to
youth organizations in the area allowing

less fortunate children the chance to enjoy
the day's activities.

Several highly touted members of the
sports community will be on hand for the
event—— former Steeler Dwayne Woodruff
and John “Chief Red Eagle” Agular, a

former world champion arm wrestler, just

to name a few.

As part of the festivities, the “Ultimate
Force” will feature a martial arts
tournament, a weight lifting competition
and an arm-wrestling display which are
open to anyone who wishes to participate
in the events. .

National Karate Scholarship Program
founder Dave Wilson will offer bonds to
eligible participants in order to help them
further their education.

The main issues that the players

medical insurance. Free agency was
the main issue though. As it stands
now, there are three types of free '
agents in the NHL. The first two are
similar. If you sign with a team, the’
team that signs you has to give up
either five first round draft picks or
players of equal value in return. The
third type of free agents, the unrestricted
type, only happens when a player
turns 31. At that time, he can sign with
any team and that team doesn’t have to

Laettner! 7be count is on! Laettner,
top of the circle./Fakes lefty dribbles
right! He shoots! Goooood!!!
Goooood!!! And tbegame is over./!
Duke wins././Duke wins’! 7beBlue
Devils return to the Final Four!!
The dynasty continues./I”

As Christian Laettner’s
turnaround jumper settled
through the Spectrum's twine last
Saturday, piercing the heart of a
feisty Kentucky squad, 104-103,
the Duke Blue Devils officially
became the Duke “Dynasty" of
the '90s, according to basketball
gurusiand fans alike.

Regardless of whether they
return from Minneapolis with a

, national title or just some cheap

souvenirs and a head cold, Mike
Krzyzewski’s gallant bunch has
solidiﬁed its claim as one of the
best teams ever. With ﬁve straight
appearances in the Final Four
(six in seven years) and one title,
Coach K's hoop hounds surpass
even the best efforts of recent
years — including Indiana's three
NCAA title (1976, 1981, 1987)
and North Carolina’s 12 straight
NCAA Sweet 16 appearances.

Having said this, Duke is not a
dynasty. I t is merely a great team.

Calling Duke a dynasty is
tantamount to calling baseball's
Cincinnati Reds a dynasty in 1975
and 1976. Were they a great team?
Yes. But does their record and
consistency as the league's best
team parallel the
accomplishments of the New
York Yankees of the 1950s and
19605? No.

Same goes for football. The
Miami Dolphins made it to three
straight Super Bowls (winning
two), but next to the Packers
(five titles in the ’60s) and the
Steelers (four rings in six years in
the 705), they are merely another
great team.

Great teams contend year in
and year out. That’s Duke.
Dynasties win championships
year in and year out. In college
basketball, that’ spells U—C-L-A.
And no one else.

The flimsy use of the word
“dynasty” in recent years —
regarding teams like the Blue
Devils, UNLV and Georgetown
— is totally unwarranted. While
each of these teams are deserving
of being labeled “great,” calling
any of them (including Duke) a
“dynasty” is a direct insult to John
Wooden’s incredible Bruins.

No- one doubts the fact that the
Bruins are the best collective team

Brian
Gallagher

ever. Ten NCAA titles in 12 years,
10 straight Final Four appearances
and 88 straight wins will attest to
that. But a further look at the
incredible Wooden-led era of
hoop dominance will again
amplify why the Bruins are the
only team worthy’ of being
deemed “a dynasty.”

The Bruins were so dominant
that their losses — which were
few and far between — became
more famous than their title-game
victories. Two of the greatest
games in NCAA history involved
upsets of the mighty Bruins: Elvin
Hayes in the Astrodome and the
end of UCLA’s 88-game winning
streak at Notre Dame. It became
such a given (that UCLA never
lost), that when the Bruins finally
lost, the sports worldcame to a
screeching halt.

As for Alcindor's three years
(which included a stellar 88-2
record and three titles), there was
also the NCAA “Lew Alcindor”
rule change — the ban of the
slam dunk— due to his incredible
abilities around the hoop.

A THE Prrr NEWS, Thursday, April‘ 2, 1992

i)uke’s dominance can’t corne close to UCLAfdynast7y

doesn_’t happen everyday, only
when the game has become one-
sided due to the dominance of a
team. Now that's a dynasty!
Walton’s legacy involves an
86-4 record, the 88—game streak
and two titles. But it also involves
the greatest single-game
performance in tournament
history: 44 points (2_1-22 from the
floor) in the 1973 title game
against Memphis State. In light of
Laettner’s great Kentucky game,
Duke assistant coach Pete Gaudet
remarked that the Blue Devil
center had “a Walton game.”
Referring great efforts in 1992 to

. 20-year-old performances speaks

volumes about the magnitude of
raucous, redhead and his mighty
team. Laettner played great like
Walton; Walton was the genuine
article.

While everyone knows about
the exploits of Bill Walton and
Lew Alcindor, most forget the
fact that UCLA won five national
titles without either of them in
the lineup, including UCLA’s first
two. That’s four more titles than
any North Carolina or Duke team!
Four more than Jordan, Ewing
and any of the greats since 1975.

Among those squads was
Wooden’s first title team (1964-
’6S), which went undefeated (30-
0) with a front court of center

Fred Slaughter and forwards Keith

Erickson and Jack Hirsch. Not.

memorable names — just
champions. The same team also
boasted a great backcourt with
Walt Hazzard and future Laker
all-star Gail Goodrich, the latter
of whom led the Bruins to a 28-
2 record and their second title.
AfterAlcindor’s three-year reign
from ’6S-'66 to ’68-'69 (three titles),
Wooden continued to crank titles

out of Westwood, using players.

like Steve Patterson, Sidney
Wicks, Curtis Rowe and Henry
Bibby to nab titles in '69-'70 and
’70—’71. All became decent pro
players, but ‘together with
Wooden they were unstoppable,
going 57-5 over two years.

All of this was the work of
Wooden, who seamlessly meshed
easily five or six different squads
into the only dynasty ever in
collegiate hoops. While Coach K
has a firm grip on the moniker of
best program in the land, the
Blue Devils have miles to go
before truly approaching the “D”
word.

Let's put it this way. Duke has
climbed to the top of the
basketball world  only to find
Coach Wooden, Walton, Alcindor
and the restof the Bruins laughing
at them and holding court.
Permanently. I

0 Pitt basketball player Dominik
Dumancic has decided to transfer.

Dumancic, the six—foot, ten—inch
junior forward, will most likely enroll
at a smaller school closer to
Meadville, where he attended high
school.

Slippery Rock University and
Clarion have been mentioned as
possible choices for Dumancic, who
played in six games this season —
totalling no points and "three
rebounds. Dumancic scored a career-
high six points against Alaska-
Anchorage on December 28, 1990.

0 Dumancic’s transfer gives Pitt
another scholarship for next season
and that could be offered to recruit
Matt Varkey, a 6’4" guard from upstate
New York.

Seton Hall was recruiting Varkey
but reportedly backed off because
of his lack of quickness. Varkey
scored 41 points in the state
championship game to lead his team
to the title.  

Staying with recruiting; Big East
recruit Otis I-Ii_ll_..wil1l be visiting his
final choicesrrsofon. Hill, a 6’8" power
forward from Pleasantville, N.Y., is

‘ said to be leaning towards Syracuse,

who could use some inside help.
Since Pitt has a scholarship waiting

in for former Perry star Will Macon, it

seems unlikely that Hill would decide
.on Pitt. .

that the players wouldn't strike
on this The owners have
proposed a compensation system
where it depends upon how much
a player is signed for to determine
compensation. If a low—priced
free agent is signed, the team that
signs him gives up nothing. If a
good player is signed, number-
one draft picks are given up for
compensation. Also, the owners
have proposed that unrestricted
free agency starts after a player

~ has 10 years of NHL playing
experience.

The players originally wanted
to get rid of the entry draft, but
they later changed their minds
and proposed a six-round draft.
The owners offered a 10-round
draft, down from the current 12.
This issue, though, seems to have
been resolved in some form.

The owners have offered a
better-than-expected pension
plan to the players, The plan calls
for the players to’ receive over
$400,000 dollars a year after they
turn 63. I can’t imagine the players
turning this down. I also can’t
imagine them turning down the
medical plan. What the owners
propose is for the players to get
free medical coverage for
anything for the rest of their lives.

No,‘ free agency is no longer
the problem. Neither is the draft,
pension or insurance. The reason
that the NHL players have gone
on strike is because of hockey
cards. Yes, hard to believe, huh?
But the hockey card and

owners want to keep. The players

be split evenly. The players do.

deserve some of this money. The
owners do, too, though. In a
league pressed for money, the
$7.5 million would help. But they
do not ‘deserve all $15 million.
A strike in the NHL is the worst
possible thing that could happen
to this league. First of all they’re
in a sad financial state as it is. The
NHL makes five million a year on
its television contract with
Sportschannel America. To put
this into perspective, Wayne

Gretzky alone gets paid over $3.

million a year.

Second, and more important,
the league has a bad image
problem as it is. This will only
add to that problem. If they go on

strike, the national media, like '

ESPN who gives them little
coverage as it is, will probably
forget about them once Major
League Baseball starts.

Also as a result of the strike, all
of the progress that the players
and owners have made on free

agency and pensions will be in '

vain. Odds are all proposals made
prior to the strike will be thrown
out, and both sides will have to
start over again. .

And once more, no matter who
is right, the fans are going to be
the ones really hit hard by the
strike because if the owners lose
money on account of the strike or
not, this will just give them an
excuse to raise ticket prices for
next year to compensate for What
they lost while the players were
on strike.

Gymnastics

Continued from page 7
9.65. The middle range of scores
came in at Butkovich (9.10),
Venezia (9.25) and Brown (9.45).

Vecchio’s score placed her into
a f1ve—gymnast tie for third place

on bars”. Sharing her honor were .

Gabby Linarducci and Wendy
Chalmers of Towson State
University, and Nicole Mullins and
Amy Dowd of the University of
New Hampshire.

The other event that the Lady
Panthers had only five competitors
performing in was the floor
exercises.

Pitt has never had any problems
with displaying its power and
skill in this event. Pitt floor scored
46.45 points for its performances.
Yohman said that the scoring
here was also tighter, but it was
constantly tight. .

The Lady Panthers compete
in this event early in the
competition, so Yohman said she
feels that one of the reasons that
the scores were so tight was that
the judges wanted to leave some
room at the top for higher scores.

Top performances from Pitt

were Halovanic (8.95), Butkovich
(9.05), Venezia (9.55), Brown
(9.50) and Vecchio (9.60). Again
Vecchio found herself in a tie for
third-place honors, but this time
she was joined by Anna Dwyer
of William and Mary and Joanne
Watson of T SU.

The balance-beam event
showed what the “Dirty Half
Dozen” were made of: guts. -The
Pitt beam squad took several
falls but earned the respect of the
judges for its determination. Pitt
tallied 45.10 on the beam with
three falls counted. ‘

The Dirty Half Dozen’s scores
were Halovanic (7.95), Jung
(8.55), Vecchio (8.95), Butkovich
(9.20), Venezia (9.35) and Brown
(9.05).

Yohman said that Brown was
rushing her routine a bit and
slipped from the beam during
her dismount, landing on her
side.Brown stood up and saluted
the contorted faces of the judges,
who were still in shock over
Brown’s fall.Brown said that the
beam was a bit slippery, and
because she was rushing her fall

looked more painful than it was.
The vaulting exercise was the

only other event that the Dirty

Half Dozen were all entered in.
The Pitt vaulting squad tallied a
46.20 for their efforts.During the

-course of this season the Lady

Panthers have upgraded their
vaults, and they still plan to
upgrade them even further. Top
vaulting scores for the Dirty Half
Dozen came from; Brown (8.85),
Halovanic (9.00), Jung
(9.00),Vecchio (9.05) and
Butkovich (9.40).

Pitt’s ﬁnal vault and Venezia’s
final vault for Pitt earned her a
third-place tie with Kim Smith of
UNH. Venezia scored 9.75 on her
vault; she also unseated Lisa
Shirk’s 1984 school—record vault
of 9.65.

Taking first place in the ECACS
for the sixth year were the Lady
Tigers of TSU with a total of

191.90 points. The remainder of _

the teams are as follows: NHU
(188.90), James Madison
University (186.55), Pitt (184.10),
W&M (182.75), Maryland (182.25)
and Northeastern (180.25).

Soon she felt that Brown could
actually be a contender for
regionals as an al1—arounder if
the team did not qualify.

Although Brown goes through

her competitions, Yohman feels
that Brown can handle regionals
in her own special way.

Looking back over this season
Yohman said that Pitt could have

‘ possibly been acontender for the

regionals if it would have had
either or both Karen Jorgensen
(who is out with an elbow injury)
or Alisha Friend (who had her
tonsils taken out three weeks
ago).

“We may have been _ a top-
three seed,” Yohman said. “The
six girls we had did all they could
to keep us in there.” A

Yohman also said she feels tha
it doesn't do any good to think of
“what ifs” because the Dirty Half
Dozen did as well as they could.

“I’m really ‘proud of their
performance this year,” Yohman
said. “They-survived the season
of ’92.”

wake-up calls
forthe ’Burgh

By Brian Berger

Sbowcase Editor

Metaphorically, the Rova Saxophone

Quartet is the world's finest _bearer of

freedom. While the quad’s musical stance
is clearly’ expressed with liberty .as its
dominant tone, that same feel was shooting
like an arrow thru the Soviet Union as the
Rovsters gigged all ove_r the former
superpower during the summer of 1989.
Playing in ‘?party correct” buildings like
The Palace Of Culture And Trade Unions,
Rova brought the house down as the

neighborhood collapsed around it. Just six »

and a half years earlier Rova moved into the
Russian family as it penetrated the iron
curtain on a three—day Soviet tour
documented on l983’s Saxaphone
Diplomacy. Its latest record, ironically titled
This Time We Are Both, was recorded
duringthe uncorked summer of:’89.

_ Like a lot of today’s wonderful jazz
musicians and groups, Rova enjoys? its
largest success and fanaticism overseas,
where jazz is received ondeserved terms.
A total of 19 LPs in 15 years of existence
with shows from Yugoslavia to Holland‘
starring improv masters like Anthony
Braxton and Henry Threadgill still haven’t
slowed the San Fran-based group, as its
newest recording shows. Extending the
ranges of group improvisation, Rova makes
fantastic free movement that lives up to its
comparison as the white ying to the World

* Saxaphone Quartet’s black yang. While it's

easy to say Rova’s sound is more classically
based (European) than WSQ’s (African),
calling this classical is like calling Pat
Buchanan — “Mr. President." ,

Enough can’t be said about the Pittsburgh
New Music Ensemble, which has
jumpstarted avant-garde life back into the
once-starved Pittsburgh scene. With Over
The Edge hinting at Sun Ra, Sonny Sharrock
and the return of Elliot Sharp in the fall,‘
Pittsbu rghers have a good excuse for living
here. As these radical changes occur at
home, Rova Saxaphone Quartet will shift
the sound/ landscape abroad with bursts of
moodiness, eloquent sqounks and
controlled chaos, all in the name of the
freedom train.

On a completely lighter and warped note
is Chicago's Shrimp Boat, a band College
Media Journal fondled like a newborn so
much that one writer proclaimed them the
best band on the planet after a live
performance at 1990’s annual CMJ music
fest. The declaration is so idiotic that it
nearly describes the band’s ridiculous
sound, which expands to old, wobbled,
country-folk harmonies to avant—jazz

, textures. One thing that should be noted is

that Shrimp Boat is a band of the worst
kind, an art institute band. The members

Famous for capturing and
combining the spirits of Harlem
and South Africa with the sounds
of his trumpet, world-renowned
jazz artist Hugh Masekela is
bringing his Uptownship tour to
Pittsburgh.

Masekela will be performing
songs from his recently released
album, “Uptown,” along with his
1l—piece band tonight at Graffiti
for a special engagement.

“Uptown” loosely reflects
Masekela’s own lifelong
sociopolitical consciousness. He
mixed the South African township
jazz of his childhood with the

‘stateside rhythm-and-blues

ballads and Motown sounds that
intrigued him when he arrived in
New York in the 19605 to study at
the Manhattan School of Music.

“We'd go to the Apollo Theatre
for one dollar and sit there for 12
hours catching the whole Motown
revue," Masekela said. ,

High-tech production allows
the music to be upbeat and
dynamic, but at the same time the
tribal sounds of Africa ring
through.

American swing and bebop,
West African folk strains,
international pop and songs with
messages of brotherhood, such
as “Hold On" and Bob Marley's
“No Woman, No Cry," fill the
album with a sound of its own.

“They’re playing jazz on
standard European instruments
rather than the folk instruments
of Africa which makes the music
very interesting," Pitt jazz—voice
instructor and professional
vocalist Doretta Bartolomeo said.

Though most famous for his
trumpet-playing, Masekela is well-
known_and respected in other
aspects of music as well. Besides
playing his trumpet, Masekela
can often be found composing,
leading a band or vocalizing.

A coal-mining community 100
miles east of Johannesburg is
where he received his first taste

Masekela’s parents, also avid
music lovers, had an ‘extensive

. 

Jazz legend Hugh Masekela goes

Duke Ellington, Count Basie,
Louis Armstrong and Glenn
Miller to name a few. Masekela
said the musical turning point
for him came when he saw the

‘Uptown’

movie “Young Man With a Horn,”
which traced the struggle of Bix
Beiderbecke, a jazz musician, for
fame and fortune.

At 20, Masekela was a member of
the first black jazz band to record
an LP in South Africa, the Jazz
Epistles. Because he wanted to
continue his education but was not
satisfied with any of the schools in
South Africa, he moved to London
and later to New‘ York.

Jazz greats Dizzy Gillespie and
Harry Belafonte encouraged
Masekela to make his recording
debut in the United States. His
debut was two muted trumpet solos
on an album by vocalist Miriam
Makeba.

Clifford , Sykes, Pitt
ethnomusicology graduate student

 and History of Jazz teaching
‘ assistant, remembers the first time

he heard the sounds of Masekela.
“I was walking down a street in

I Kansas City and heard this music

that just knocked me out. I loved it.
I never heard anything like it —— it
was different than anything I’d ever
heard. That day I bought the album.
[Masekela] is an excellent trumpet
player. And, as much as possible,
he- tried to remain true to his roots

and to American jazz foundations .

Paradoxical

realities of —

Boogie Down Productions
Sex And Violence '
Jive/RCA Records

Kris Parker says that he is “rap
music” and where he and his
fellow BDP members go, “so
goes rap,” and he may be right.
Like‘ much of rap lyrics and rap
attitude in general, BDP is full of
contradictions. From the
stomping incident of P.M. Dawn
to his pro-human, anti—gangster
image, BDP’s paradoxical world
is encompassed on Sex And
Violence. By failing to define the
thin line between ideals, Kris can

come off more like a hypocrite

than theeducated teacher he
preaches to be. But like the reality

he solely bases his work in, life
too is full of contradictory images
and ideals. Thus, BDP is life and
reality in it’s simplest polar
oppositional existence.

In rap though, there seems to
be an unwritten rule that sending
contrasting messages can harm
your street respect. For Kris, the
problem lies in his past and now
omni—present sucker MC duck
down message and the idealistic
human stance that dominates his
lectures and vinyl. So people and
critics are having a hard time
deciphering what image Kris is
trying to present through lyrics.
But ironically, underneath all this
is the fact what makes a track go
is the beats, if the track is wack it

doesn’t matter what you’re saying

anyway.

But Kris has always known that '

and that’s a primary reason why
his stance is so analyzed because
he backs up his message with
beats. From the psuedo gangsta,
yet correct Criminal Minded

\ debut to “World Peace” discourse
in Ghetto Music, Kris has taken»

I A By Brian Gallagher

Staﬁ“ Writer

“Basketball is a city game. Its
battlegrounds are strips of asphalt
between tattered wire fencesor
crumbling "buildings. Its rhythms
grow from the uneven thump of
a ball against hard surfaces.
Basketball is more than a sport or
diversion in the cities. It is the

A fabric of life." — Pete Axthelm.

This quip from the late
columnist——which so eloquently
captures the passion and guts of
inner-city hoops, accompanies
the press notes to W/7z'teMen Cam’!
jump, the latest effort from
director/writer R-on Shelton (Bull
Durham, Blaze). In W/91'te»Men,
Shelton aims to capture the tone
of Axthelm’s prophesy in a '90s
hustler/fish-out-of—water llick,
merging the unpredictable, high-
flying antics of street basketball
with the celluloid—friendly (and
profitable) topic of racial tension.

Shelton’s resident “white man”
in the story is Billy Hoyle (Woody
Harrelson), a street—wise, hook-
line-and—sink,er type ballplayer
who survives on the courts with
a tattered, choirboy mug and a
decent game to boot. Hoyle
arrives from Louisiana td scam on

the inner—city pavements of Los

Angeles. It is there that he
confronts, hustles and cohorts

.with Sidney Deane (Wesley

Snipes), L.A.’s best boy of hoops.
The initial meeting of Hoyle

and Deane results in some fast-
paced ball-busting and ball-
busting, with Hoyle providing
the slick passing and Deane ﬁlling
the airways with recycled mother

slams and jabs at Boyle like “Hey! .

Slim, white, geeky Chump!” and
“Y0, Cindy Brady!” It works,
thanks mostly to the gaudy hoop
action and Snipes’ cocksure
glowing arrogance.
Unfortunately, it’s a pace than
cannot be sustained.

Shelton’s plan to create a visual
menage a trois with topics like
racism, basketball and love falls
apart soon after the first 25
minutes. What follows is a
fumbling flood of forays filled
with hoops-hustling, racial
ramblings, money troubles and
confusin g love quarrels involving
Deane and his wife, Rhonda (a
tough T yra Ferrell), and Hoyle
and his girlfriend, Gloria (a fiery
Rosie Perez). Add to that a
meaningless sideline story
concerning Hoyle’s unpaid debt
to some mobsters, and the whole
ball of yarn is unwound —-— never
to recover. The only entity that
keeps this puppy aﬂoat is the
juicy combo of basketball and
backbeats, when the street-ball
footage meets the films’ funky
soundtrack for some memorable
dribble—drive "sequences.

Harrelson doesn’t make the
final cut in yet another effort to
emerge from his innocent “Woody

Boyd/Cheers” image, which
accompanies his blond, punch-
drunk, Midwest-boy features.
Throughout the 100+ minutes of
film time, Shelton’s awkward and
aimless script tosses gritty and
raw lines at Harrelson’s Hoyle
character, mostly to no avail.

For example, following an
awkwardly sensual embrace with
Gloria, Hoyle leaves her on the
bed to take a shower. As he lifts
himself off her, he places a jar
filled with money between her
legs and promises to “put my
mouth where that money is”
when he returns.

In addition to the
aforementioned loser quote,
Hoyle numbs the ﬂick with a
plethora of “f—'- this” and “f——

thats,” most which come off as

forced and unbelievable.

Snipes survives much better,
thank you, using the same
demonstrative, royal attitude that
won him praise in noble efforts
like New jacle City and Jungle
Fever, giving his Deane character
both a heart of gold and a heart
of ﬁre. As for Perez and Ferrell,
Perez makes the most of her

perky body and voice. Her best
scenes involve an amusing
appearance on the game show
“Jeopardy” and several ‘heated
moments with Harrelson. It’s too
bad Harrelson couldn’t match the

(A quick hoop note: Snipes
and Harrelson actually do all of
the on-screen playing and excel
and hold their own with the rest
of the b-ball actors — among
whom are former Milwaukee
Bucks’ all-star Marquesjohnson.)

The concept of White Men

sassy, seductive tail of base hittin’

critically and commercially. W/bite

office success ($15 million out of

appeal of its stars (Harrelson and
Snipes) and a slick advertising
campaign. But as for on-screen
quality, it's a no—brainer.

THE PITI‘ NEWS, Thursday, April 2, 1992

 

terrain.

Like the various vocal ﬂavors
that Kris drops on Sex And
Violence, there is also a broad
range of topics, none of which
clarify Kris’ enigmatic stance.
Blasting off with a tribute to past
hip hop styles, a la freestyle lyrical
grunts through primitive
equipment, Kris and guest Freddie
Foxxx come on the sucker MC tip
with Kris boasting about the one
thing he’s always been able to
stress and convince his audience
of. — He ain’t no sell-out
commercial D]. A lot of the LP is
typical of Criminal Minded
rhetoric. Male Bragadoccio done
over simple beats with a lot of
bass. Tracks like “We In’T here,”
with its repetitive chorus
pronouncing BDP’s presence and
demand for respect, and the first
single “Duck Down”- stomping
on wanna-be rappers with its
metallic churn and ultra beat.
The other posse cut, with Freddie
Foxxx again joining in, is “Ruff
Ruff.” I've never heard anyone
say anything positive about
Foxxx’s style, but the jam still
moves courtesy of the “Spaghetti”
horn loop, and while Foxxx
certainly ain’t “the militant mack,”
Kris shows his prowess on the
mic, some’en no one can deny.

Kris again breaks new ground
lyrically on “Drug Dealer,” urging

pushers to invest in schools and
community development with
their drug-peddled money. “Build
And Destroy” is Kris’ “Jack The
Ripper” as he lashes back at X-
Clan, Poor Righteous Teachers
and others who have taken pot
shots at him on vinyl, coming
from his philosophical podium
he stresses his anti-commercial
appeal while striking back over a
lowrider bass riff. “Questions
AndlAnswers” points directly at
Kris’ conﬂicting messages as he
quips about not getting on any
covers (of mags and zines). But
why would someone with such a
strong anti—corporate feel care
about being on covers? Making
things harder to decipher is the
fact that he says on the same cut,
that all that matters is staying true
to the street. Respect is what it’s
all about and while Kris may not
care about whether he’s labeled
a hypocrite, one thing he demands
is respect.

And does Kris respect women?
Listening to past records and
lectures his tone is deﬁnitively
pro—feminine, but if you had only
heard Sex And Violence you'd
think Kris was a male chauvinist.
“Say Gal” picks up where the
Tyson/Smith trial and debates
left off with the chorus “you
creepin’ and a sleepin’ with the
stardom.. first you do the nasty..

then he raped me” —~ attacking
women who claim rape when all
they was looking for was a romp.
But with Kris, you have to look
past- the rhythmic prose and
realize that he isn’t talking about
all females, but the gold diggers
using a serious stance like rape
and molestation for individual
exploitive purposes. Using the
all hip-hop reggae ﬂavor the track
is one of the hypest on the LP
with its rasta -pulse and low
highhat.

Sportin’ a jazzy Sade loop, “13
and Good” is the wax’s second
single. Saying he just wanted to
say that policevchiefs are gay, the
tale has Kris sleeping with a 13-
year-old girl only to say she was
“good” and then have her pops
(the cop) bumrush his apartment
and proceed to make a move on
him.

The sex track on the ‘record
could beinterpreted literally as a
gay cop or metaphorically for the
police system’s incompetence.
Other fat tracks include “How

Not To Get jerked,” with a hype
drum track, and the breath control
of “Like A Throttle.”

Kris says he does concept
albums, and if that’s the case
then SexAnd Violenceis the BDP
posse’s mentality rolled into one.
With all the titles he’s given
himself over the years (teacher,
poet, community activist, etc.)
the message becomes no clearer
to the audience. But it’s out there

Sextet alive

Steve Lacy Sextet
Live at Sweet Basil
Novus/BMG Music

Soprano saxophonist Steve Lacy

' has never been one to concern

himself with fitting in. His styles

 

range from the Indian—inspired
sounds of John Coltrane to the
wilder, harmonic art/noise/sound
that emanates from bars in the
depths of Greenwich Village. For
years Lacy has held his own sound
together by keeping his sextet
virtually intact (just one personnel
change in the past 10 years). And
once a year, we on the younger
side of the Atlantic are honored
with a few performances.

This recording comes from a
July 1991 set at Sweet Basil in
NYC. The five songs on the disc
(each of them are over 10 minutes
in length) represent a vivid cross-
section of Lacy’s work as well as
the excitement and pleasure that
live music offers. A group as
tightly—knit as this sextet deserves
to be recorded live, for it is in that
setting that they can surprise even

_ themselves. A

The opener, “Prospectus,” has

a big-band-gone-haywire feel to

it. Always a soloist, Lacy shows
that all well-versed jazz groups
are only a few people away from
being an excellent big band. The
vocals, sung in French by Irene
Aebi, jump around within the
piece, but the whole sound is
reminiscent of.an older tune. The
drum work ofjohn Betsch sounds
a lot like that of Louie Bellson,
one of the mightiest_ swingers
around. Lacy and fellow sax-man
Steve Potts settle into a question-
and—answer groove, constantly
following the lead of bassistJean-
Jacques Avenel. Having two saxes
is a great advantage to the sound
of the sextet because the soloists
arelaccorded a lot of freedom,
rhythmically. The tonal piano of
Bobby Few reminds me of McCoy
Tyner, circa 1962, but it is not as
complex. Not as musically
complex, “Prospectus” is
nonetheless quite a solid song.
The second number, “The



Bath,” is a Dexter Gordondike.
song, according to the liner notes.
While Potts’ soloing does remind
me of Dex, the piece as a whole
has Monk running through it.
The staccato elements in the
melody and the brilliant laziness
are typical Monk qualities and
demonstrate the understated
value of spacing in jazz. Potts and
Lacy are two very different
players, which helps to make the
disc more interesting. Potts has a
bluesier, fuller sound, while Lacy
punctuates his solos with quick
stabs and blurted-out phrases.
“Morning Joy,” the third song,
is the other vocal cut. Once again
Aebi is echoed by Lacy, but this
song is different from a lot of
other vocal jazz tunes. In this
song, the words (in English this
time) seem to dictate the flow of
the music, rather than the other
way around. It’s an interesting

switch, and it manages to keep
the listener of f-balance. With over
16 minutes to play with,
everybody gets into the act. The
result is something like a David
Murray song recorded live: lots of
extended solo work, which
doesn’t necessarily relate to the
theme but is great anyway. The
only drawback is that Aebi does
not get a vocal solo of her own.
However her astonishing violin
solo is a quivering delight.

The best song is “The Wane,”
which comes from a set of songs
about the Vietnam War. “The
Wane” has the raw emotionality
of Coltrane’s stuff, and the

I  brooding element is one ofthe

strongest I’ve heard in a while.
Lacy and Aebi’s solos are both
chocked full of the wailing voice
that came from so many mid-
1960s efforts. Few counteracts
the emotion by carrying his
portion along with grace and
felicity.

A “Blinks,” one of Lacy’s older
compositions and one of my

personal favorites,‘ rounds out
the album. The sextet pulls out
all the stops on this one, moving

the piece along at a frenetic pace. ‘

The two sax solos dart in and out
of the rhythm section’s capable
work, and then the rest of the
group drops out to allow Few his
time alone. The pianist makes
quick work of the musical map,
establishing his own sound and
rhythm right away. Betsch finishes
with a solo of his own, and the
band exits.

Lacy’s music has long been
pegged as noisy or spacy, but it is
neither one or the other. It is both
and more. Of course, being
recorded live helps the sound of
nearly every jazz band I know.
With freedom to experiment,
Lacy’s sextet shows that it can do
most everything: swing, noise,
avant-garde and more, with
visions of Monk, ‘Trane, Blakey,
Basie and Mingus swirling about
continually. "

Soprano is such a difficult
instrument tomaster, and Lacy is
still the bestsoprano man around,
after all these years. Overall,
Bobby Few’s performance on
piano is terrific, and the chemistry
is real. These aren’t just good
players; they are good players
who have played with each other
a long time.

Budweiser gets its local rocks off

By Tonya Hurley

- Smﬂ Writer

Pittsburgh bands tuned up their guitars Tuesday
night at Graffiti ‘as Budweiser held auditions,
giving local bands an opportunity to represent

. the region for the company.

One of the bands, Room to Move, waited for
over two hours for its time to rock the house,
Pittsburgh-style.

“I am used to playing in front of crowds, but
I am more nervous about playing in front of my
colleagues,” Taylor Sinclair, the guitar player
said. "‘Since we all work, we never get to go out
and see each other.”

The funk-rock of Room to Move gave the
crowd a perfect opportunity to show the

_ representatives of Budweiser just what Pittsburgh

is made of as they danced to the song “Wrecking
Ball.” & .
Jack Thompson of Next Big T hing Productions
said that 35 bands forwarded press packages to
Budweiser in Chicago and eight of them were
selected on the basis of original music.

In the past Budweiser held the auditions in six
markets, and just recently it expanded to 24,
including Pittsburgh. The winners will be
announced in a few weeks. Once announced,
they will receive $5,000; they will do local,
public—service announcements dealing with
responsible drinking; they will have access to a
national public-relations firm, equipment from
Washburn, tour shirts, promotional aides and
national advertising support.

“After the bands perform, we will have a
question/answer session. We will ask them how

many days a week they play-, and we will answer ,

any questions they might have about the
auditions,” Terrence Schwarz, a Budweiserjudge,
said.

Room to Move will be anxiously awaiting
word from the judges. “We’ll make a new record
with the money,” guitarist Don Szejk said,

The bands that were chosen to audition

included Chill Factor International, Illuminatus, '

Nixon Clocks, Room to Move, Bill Deasy Band,
The Clarks, T orn ‘N Frayed (the winners of the
I.C. Light Rock Challenge) and Triple X. .

For most of us in Western Pennsylvania three meals a day are assured. For approximately '
200,000 of our neighbors, however, it is a luxury that doesn’t always happen. To help address this
' problem the University will again participate  the Scouting for Food campaign, a food collection .
drive sponsored by the Allegheny Trails Coucil of the Boy Scouts of America. Shortly, employees will
lains the program and a food collection bag. Students also are

You can help with this vital project by bringing nonperishable food and grocery items to the '
University from April 7 to 9, and putting them in the hampers and boxes placed at strategic locations
in most University buildings. While any canned food in good condition is welcome, there are several
types of foods which are preferred because of their nutritional value: peanut butter, chunky-type
soups, canned tuna, canned stews, calmed meats, baby formula or any complete packaged meal.

Once collected the food items will be provided to the_area’s 450 food pantriesand kitchens for
distribution to needy individuals. A growing concern with this year s campaign IS. the large number
of single mothers and frail elderly who are turning to the food kitchens and pantries for assistance.
Today, nearly 60 % of the food collected goes to help women and children.

Last year the University’s contribution was tremendous with more that 7,500 items of food
for Food effort this year will be greatly appreciated. Thank
