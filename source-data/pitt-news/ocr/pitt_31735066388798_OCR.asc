Students
learn to

“deal with

StI’€SS

By Mindy Boffemmyer
Staff Writer

Counsellor Nadine J. Snyder,
R.N., M.A., N.C.C., C.S., dis-
(Uss(‘(l various changes that can
be made to alleviate stress during
a stress management session held
Saturday at the William Pitt
Union.

"Try to design your life to yield
more day to day fulfillment,”
Snyder said. ”And break work
down into manageable units so
it’s not so overwhelming."

The indicators of stress include
an inability to concentrate, a feel-
ing of pervading doom, an upset
stomach, insomnia and muscle
cramps. They also tend to be in-
dicators of depression, Snyder
noted.

Some of the main causes of
stress among students are poor
health habits, disorganization,
procrastination, lack of commu-
nication with others and over-
scheduling, she said.

Healthy people who are able to
relax tend to be more capable of
managing stress, so modifications
in diet, exercise, sleeping habits
and relaxation techniques can be
beneficial, Snyder said.

”Eat more proteins, but in
small, lean portions, and foods

Zgccontaining vitamins A, C and B

complex. Exercise doing some-
thing you enjoy and relax tense
muscles to free your energy for
coping,” said Snyder.

Relaxation techniques dis-
cussed at the session included
deep breathing, warm baths,
massages and engaging in enjoy-
able activities.

”Don’t schedule more than
you can handle, and remember
that there's nothing wr()ng with
asking for help,” she said.

Snyder said that test anxiety
during midterms and finals could
be eliminated if students regLilat—
ed study habits throughout the
term.

”You should look at grades as
a reward for your performance
and compete with yourself to do
better. Look at them as a way to
figure out what you have learned
and what you still need to learn,”
commented Snyder.

"Create the best circumstances
that bring you the most happiness
and the most satisfaction,” she
said. ”Have an adequate amount
of pleasure and enough protec-
tion from stress in your life.”

Hardships and relationships
are portrayed in BAS play

By Marc Hopkins
Staff Writer

"Cultural pride and the beauty
of black love” was the theme,
Saturday evening in the Union as
the Kuntu Repertory Theatre per—
formed the play, Still I Rise.

The production, sponsored by
the Black Action Society, was
held in honor of Black History
Month.

Still I Rise used poetic works by
Maya Angelou and Langston
Hughes along with musical selec-
tions by artists including Natalie
Cole and Lionel Ritchie.

The play portrayed the hard-
ships black individuals face in
our society and the importance of
strong relationships.

The inspiration of Still I Rise
and its message of black relation-
ships stemmed from two books
written by Dr. Frances J. Barnes,
author of Love From Black Worn-
en to Black Men and Love From
Black Men to Black Women.

"The basis of the book [Love
From Black Men to Black Wom-
en],” said Barnes, "came from
the hostility between black men
and black women. My daughter
attended Pitt at a time when black
males wanted white females. My
daughter and a friend of hers
were upset about being re-

jected.”

One of Dr. Barnes’ orginal
poems was featured in the play.

The cast members of Still I Rise
all agreed that the play had an im-
portant message to convey.

”The play was a excellent por-
trayal of relationships between
black men and black women,"
said Rema Webb, one cast mem-
ber. ”It wasn't an alienation

against other races, there was a
message to all."

"I believe in my lines," said
Shawn Mattox, ”they really
meant something to me.”

The Kuntu Repertory Theatre
was founded by Dr. Vernell Lil-
lie in 1974 and is part of Pitt's
Department of Black Communi-
ty Education Research and De-
velopment.

Private

parties can
give funds
to Contras

By Larry Margasak

Associated Press Writer

VVASI IIN(1T( )N  The Justice
Department said private support-
ers of the Nicaraguan Contras c an
legally raise funds for the l'(‘l)(‘ls.

The Contras’ backers will have
to step gingerly, though, it they
want to avoid past mistakes that
have led to criminal charges or
made them -— both wittingly and
unwittingly --- part of the Iran-
Contra affair.

For instance, US. law would
prohibit the private bat kers from
shipping arms now in the United
States to the Contras without State
Department approval.

And the department would
have to agree before U.S.-made
arms could l)e sent from other
countries to the rebels.

Other laws prohibit the launch-

ing of private military operations

from U.S. soil and require regis-
tration of anyone operating as an
agent of a foreign entity.

Internal Revenue Service rules
say that tax—exempt charitable or-
ganizations must raise money for
food, clothing and shelter —— not
for weapons.

Private Contra backers said last
week they would try anew to
raise money for the rebels be-
cause of the IIouse’s reiec tion of
$36.2 million in aid.

”Based on my conversations
with lawyers here in the depart-
ment, it’s my untlerstanding that
there c urrently are no laws \\ltl( It
prohibit a private (iti/en from
donating money to the Coiitras,”
Justice Department spokesman
Terry Eastland said.

Last year, public relations ex-
ecutive Richard Miller and con-
servative fund-raiser Carl R.
”Spitz” Channell pleaded guilty
to conspiring to defraud the
government. Independent Coun-
sel Lawrence Walsh charged
them with illegally using a tax-
exempt foundation to raise $3
million to arm the Contras.

The government was cheated
out of tax revenue from donors,
who were wrongly told they
could deduct the funds from their
income taxes, Walsh said at the
time.

Fund raisers also have to follow
the 2()O—year-old Neutrality Act,
which prohibits the launching of
a military expedition from the
United States against a nation at
peace with this country.

PLO chief Arafat orders U.N. hostages released

S|l)( )N, lebanon Pl.() guer-
rillas Sunday surrounded a house
holding two kidnapped Sc an-
clinaviaii United Nations em-
ployees and their abcliictors, and
Pt () chief Yasser /\rafat oideiecl
the hostages freed.

lhe Palestine I ilieiation ()r-
gani/ation’s Sidon commander,
/\nwar Macli, who issued the ord-
er in this southern lebanese port
city, said his guerrillas might use
toic e to release the twc) captives.

“We shall try to gain their free-
dom with peaceful means. But if
this proves ineffective, we shall
resort to other means,” Madi told
reporters. ”We expect they will
he free in 48 hours."

Sources close to Madi said the
two captives -—- United Nations
Relief and Works Agency em-
ployees Jan Stening, 44, of
Sweden, and William lorgensen,
38, of Norway -- were being
held in a deserted hou.se that had
been enc irc led by Pl () guerrillas
near Siclon's lain el-l lilweh retu-
gee camp.

"\\'e have c leai orders from
*\t.il.tl to siorin the hideout if the
raptors tail to tree the mo cap-

 

   

tives peat etully,” said one
souic e, who spoke on condition
of anonymity.

Steniiig and lorgensen were
traveling in an UNRWA car frorii
their base in the southern tel)-
anese port of "lyre to Beirut on
l iiday when they were interc epi-
ed and kidnapped by masked
gunmen on Sidon’s southern out-
slsirts.

They were the first Scandinavi-
ans to be abducted in Lebanon.
An UNRWA 'communique
released Saturday said it had
been established that the captors‘
were Palestinians ’’acting in-
dividually without a political
motive."

Madi said the kidnappers were
”su.spicious, unruly elements
who do not belong to any or-
ganized Palestinian group. They
are in a location that is geographi-
(ally under our control."

The kidnapping of the pair of
UN. workers was l)lastecl by U.S.
officials along with the various
leaders of Americ a's European al-
lies, who have repeatedly
demanded the immediate release
oi the pair.

Inquiry into rape case

may end this week

l’lTTSBUR(Jl l  An investiga-
tion into the handling of a wom-
an's frantic plea for help to the
city's 911 emergency number is
expected to be completed early
this week, authorities said.

Police ordered the probe after
learning the woman was raped
twice by a knife-wielding as-
sailant after she called for help.
The six policemen who respond-
ed were told to investigate a bur-
glary and never knew the call had
been placed by the woman
herself.

Public safety officials said the
investigation already shows an
apparent violation in the way
civilian dispatchers relayed infor-
mation to police before sending
them to the woman's house in
the city's Point Bree/e section.

The officers, who left the scene
without trying to force their way

into the house, were never told
the woman's telephone call had
been cutoff. Police also failed to
ciuery dispatchers as to the source
of the call.

Police (Thief Ralph Pampena
said the city public safety depart-
ment’s Office of Professional
Responsibility still must complete
three or four interviews with
police and dispatchers who han-
dled the call la.st Tuesday night.

Few clues in case of

disappearance of lady

PlTTSBUR(}ll --- More than a
year after a woman disappeared,
police still are searching for clues.

Sally J. White of Pittsburgh's
Bellevue section left her home
early Jan. 21, 1987. White, who
was 29, left without taking her
purse, which contained her
wallet and credit cards. Her two
sons, aged seven and nine, were
asleep.

"We've hit solid brick walls in
the case," said police officer
Richard Czapko. ”We’ve turned
up no leads whatsoever, and
we're hoping that if there is any-
one out there with information,
they will come forward.

but officials from the Department of Aging are currently con-
sidering the problem. The only solution offered by the Coun-

cil now is an emergency fund to house some patients.

When the growing numbers of AIDS patients and the cur-
rent lack of support facilities are considered, it is obvious that
some sort of action is needed. The county, hopefully in tan-
dem with state and federal government offices, should be work-

ing with the local groups to develop a resident care facility.
While there is not an overriding demand for such housing in
Pittsburgh, planning could help to ease the problems that now

exist.

In a nutshell 

I used to say poltics was the second oldest
profession, and I have come to know that it bears
a gross similarity to the first.

DES MOINES, Ic)wa —- The tall
and grey—haired Iowan wore a Si-
mon button prominently dis-
played on her lapel. But as we
passed in the Convention Center
hallway, she smiled and flashed
open her jacket. On the lining,
there was a blue sticker revealing
a very different allegiance: ”If
only a woman were running”

Such a yearning may have
been widespread at the Women's
Agenda Conference last
weekend, but it was kept equal-
ly close to the vests of the 1,100
women who attended. This was
a coming-together party for the
women who want to have an im-
pact on the 1988 campaign.

Next fall, 10 million more
women than men are expected to
vote. The message the women
here wanted to send to the can-
didates and the country was
deliberately as deep as those
grass roots and as widespread as

the bipartisan membership of the ~

_42 national women's groups -
from Business and Professional

Women to the National Wom-

—— Ronald Reagan

en's Political Caucus — that or-
ganized this event.

It was expressed this way by
Sarah Harder, president of the
American Association of Univer-
sity Women, in her warning to
presidential candidates: ”Don’t
think of women's issues as a tiny
handful of set-asides that will
satisfy a rowdy minority.”

Indeed, in 1984, when
presidential candidates and wom-
en's groups met, there was a sim-
ple script, a short checklist of
issues and surefire applause lines.
The men had only to mention the
Equal Rights Amendment, the
Democrats had only to mention
Geraldine Ferraro, and they con-
sidered the courtship complete.

”What we found out,” said
Ann Lewis, a Democratic adviser

and longtime activist, as she-

Iooked back on 1984, ”is that not
everybody felt included. The
women working, juggling home
and a family, did not necessarily
feel well represented by the
agenda/’

Today, the agenda is more in-

a deep, distinguished, off-screen
voice says, "Before there was Pla-
toon, there was Rambo."

This was the commercial I saw
three or fc)ur times last week, ad-
vertising last night's NBC Sunday
Night Movie, Rambo: First Blood
Part 2.

Rambo: First Blood Part _’ con-
sists of Sta||one’s freeing of
American M|As from a Vietnam
prison camp while killing a few
hundred Vietnamese soldiers in
the process.

The film is filled with blood,
exploding bodies and of course,
all varieties of guns and bombs;
it was a box-office smash.

Violence has always been a
favorite pastime of our country
and the subject of Vietnam is a
Hollywood producer's wet
dream.

clusive and complicated: a com-
posite of jobs, housing, child
care, health care, education and
peace. At this meeting, the Na-
tional Organization for Women,
once the flagship of the women's
movement, was just a wing of a
larger and more moderate fleet.
The issues were geared toward

the bread-and—butter anxieties of

women, their daily concerns
were about family life, children
and the future.

”Women and men don't live in
the same economic world," ex-
plained Celinda Lake of The
Analysis Group, as she drew a
portrait of the wc)men’s vote from
her research. ”They don't work in
the same jobs, make the same
money, juggle the same roles.”
By and large, women are more
pessimistic about the future, tend
to frame larger issues in terms of
their daily lives. They are less
likely to feel that politicians are
speaking their language. In the
most general terms, she said,
”Women are looking for some-
one who understands their lives.”

DUCIIIN

It seems our society is always
looking for newer and better
methods of death and destruction
in movies. Considering that one
can only kill and maim a limited
amount of people, l’l()ll\'\\'()()(l
has set its sights on the location
of the greatest blooclbath of all —
Vietnam.

Films like Rambo, .\li.s.sing in
A\ction, ,\li.ssing in .-\ction Part _’
and .\lis_sing in xlction Part i,
seem to be based on getting even
with the one enemy that defeat-
ecl Uncle Sam.

In reality, the right response to
the Vietnam war is not revenge
but unclerstanding it as one of
mankind's mistakes -— a mistake
to be included with black slavery
and the holocaust of six million

dates have that unclerstanclingt
The five Democrats who c ame to
the conference's l’i'c-siclential to-
ruin all appeared more comfort-
able with the audience and the
issues than their preclecessors
were in I98-l.

()f the group, Paul Simon's ap-
peal was cast in the most narrow,
even dated, terms: a checklist of
Senate bills he co-sponsorecl. The
more successful messages —
notably those of Mike Dukakis
and Bruce Babbitt —- integrated
women's concerns into an essay
answer rather than a. list. Babbitt
particularly spoke in a language
that resonated with many wom-
en, ranging easily from the per-
sonal to the political.

The clear disappointment for
women at this bipartisan confer-
ence was the total absence of the
Republican candidates, who are
still, in this primary season, more
worried about the party's right
wing than about its center. As
Republican Ann Stone said un-
happily, ’’I’m afraid they thought

Hunter, Platoon, (‘om/ng llome,
andlull .\letal /acket have e\-
pressed the true pain of the war
in Vietnam. However, the public
chooses to spend more money on
violence rather than truth.

.~\meric‘a will always have a fas-
c ination with superficial war

clastsifv Rambo with I’/atoon cor-
rupts the lesson of the Vietnam
war.

Television editing will pre\ent
children from seeing the most
gory and painful deaths of Ram-

see enough to ask their parants
for a Rambo doll and permission

to see the soon to be released

The conference here marked a
very real transition for women in
American politics. Women's is-

the role of women voters in the

Wrestlers
fall short
to Huskies

By Vince Carey

Assistant Sports Editor

The Pitt wrestling team took
Bloomsburg down to the wire Fri-
day night in a 19-17 loss.

The loss put the Panthers at
7-3-1 overall and 1-2 in the
Eastern Wrestling League.
Bloomsburg improves to 8-4 an(l
2—() in the EVVL.

”l think we wrestled kind of
sloppy," Bloomsburg coach Carl
Sanders said. ’’It was good to
come out of here with a win, but
I was disappointed with some of
the intensity that our guys came
in with."

This was a meet of streaks.

The Huskies took the first three
matches to give them a healthy
9-0 lead. Then All-American Pat
Santoro (38-0) came to the mat
for Pitt, and stopped the roll.

Santoro dominated his match,
winning 24-9. With time running
out in the last period, Santoro in-
itiated two takedowns to give him

 Lady Panthers bow in
 overtime to Eagles,

prepare for Syracuse

By Matt Martin

Assistant Sports Editor

\/Vhen Boston College came to
Ht/gerald Field House to face Big
East rival Pitt Saturday afternoon,
the Eagles were prepared to play
one of the most improved teams
in the league.

The Lady Panthers had been on
a roll, winning four of their last
five games and boasting the Big
East’s Freshman of the Week for
the previous two weeks, l_orri
Johnson.

But even Johnson could not
muster enough offensive firepow-
er to defeat the Eagles as BC beat
Pitt 73-67 in overtime.

The Lady Panthers" led ()5-()3,
when B(‘ sophomore forward
Ann’ LaCombe hit a 13-foot jum-
per with si\ seconds left to tie the
game an(l force the overtime
period.

The Eagles then took it to Pitt,
outscoring them 10-2 in the over-
time period. Pitt did not score un-
til 6-foot-4 freshman center
Connie Hurt hit a turnaround
jumper with 14 seconds re-
maining.

Although the game went to
overtime, it was decided in the
first 20 minutes. The Lady Pan-
thers shot only 33 percent in the
opening period as Boston College
swept the boards, denying Pitt the
chance for second opportunities.

Pitt also committed 10 tur-
novers and 13 personal fouls in
the first half.

”They set the tempo on us ear-
ly in the ball game,” Lady Pan-
ther head coach Kirk Bruce said.
”There’s no question [that the first

half was the deciding factor in the
gamel."

”We have to play hard for 40
minutes and keep the intensity
up. But we came out a little soft,
and we just weren’t attacking in
the overtime period," Bruce con-
tinued.

The Lady Panthers trailed
39-31 at the half.

Despite Lacombe’s heroic shot
to tie the game, the second half
belonged to Pitt. Four Lady Pan-
thers scored in double figures.

JLinior forward Deidra Baker
led Pitt with 16 points and 1() re-
bounds, while Hurt finished with
12 points and four blocked shots.

Johnson and sophomore guard
lennifer Shingler each scored 10
points, and Shingler led Pitt with
seven assists.

The Eagles also had four dou-
ble digit scorers. Leslie Bjerstedt
an(l Bridget Cody each had 18
points and Lacombe and point
guard Anne ()doy scored 12
each.

The Eagles (1 1-9, 6-5) defeated
Pitt 70-44 earlier this year at
Boston College in the Lady Pan-
thers’ worst shooting perform-
ance of the year. BC held Pitt to
42 percent from the field in this
game.

”They sag — they leave their
girl on the perimeter and one
down low,” Bruce said, explain-
ing how the Eagles limited Pitt's
offense. ”The same thing was
almost true the first time around,’
he said.

But Bruce was not totally dis

heartened by the loss, Pitt's.

East defeated the West 138-133.

Dominique Wilkins, Jordan's
slam—dunk rival in Saturday's
competition that went down to
Jordan's final dunk, was barely
overshadowed again as he scored
29 for the East, which now leads
the series 25-13.

Jordan, the unanimous MVP af-
ter hitting 17 of 23 field goal
shots, was only two points shy of
the All—Star record of 42, by Wilt

Chamberlain in 1962. He more
than doubled his total of 18 in
two previous All-Star ap-
pearances.

Karl Malone led the West with
22 points, Akeem Olajuwon had
21 and Lafayette‘ Lever scored 17.

Kareem Abdul—Jabbar scored

10 points and became the all-

time leading Al|—Star scorer with
247 points in 17 appearances.
Magic Johnson had 17 points

and 19 assists for the West.

Jordan scored 18 points in the
first half as the East opened a
60—54 halftime lead.

The West, which trailed by as
many as 10 points in the first half,
got two three-point plays from
Johnson to close the deficit to
78-75 with 6:43 left in the third
quarter.

Leyland thinks good fortunes of
Pirates will continue this year

By Jim Leyland

For The Associated Press

How good can the Pittsburgh
Pirates be in 1988? Emphasizing
our strong finish in 1987 -— 27
wins in the last 38 games — it is
a question everyone in Pittsburgh
has been asking this winter.

When General Manager Syd
Thrift and I came here, our goal
was to build the Pirates into a
consistent, winning franchise. It
was a long—range thing, and we
have made great strides. In fact,
we are probably ahead of
schedule.

What Syd has done is go out
and acquire more quality ath-
letes. Take guys like Darnell
Coles, Andy Van Slyke or Bobby
Bonilla, players who are not one-
dimensional, who automatically
make a better ballclub. Now we
have to win from within. By that,
I mean we have to continue to
mature our own talent.

Doug Drabek, Mike Dunne
and Brian Fisher have been
referred to as the big three in our
rotation. Pitching coach Ray
Miller has done a great job with
these guys, but there will still be
some growing pains, and they
have to keep making progress.

The fourth starter should be Bob
Walk, who has done everything
we've asked and has taken ad-
vantage of his chances.

The fifth spot is up for grabs,
and there are a lot of people to
consider, including right-handers
Mike Bielecki and Vicente Pala-
cios and left-handers Bob Kipper
and Bob Patterson. A left-hander
would be a big help, but we'll go
with the best pitcher. Someone
has to take a step forward.
They've gotten their feet wet and
had their chances.

Jim Gott, Jeff Robinson and
John Smiley are a pretty good trio
to start off with when you talk
about your bullpen. I think Gott
has always had great stuff, and
toward the end of the season he
started believing in himself.
Robinson has been one of the
most effective relievers in the
league the past two years. These
two can pick each other up.
There will be several competing
for the other jobs in the pen, in-
cluding Barry Jones, who has
shown progress this winter.

Offensively, one of our needs
has been a right-handed power
hitter. I have a good feeling about
outfielder Darnell Coles, and if he
can play to his potential, we may

have foudd that power hitter.

Barry Bonds and Andy Van
Slyke are in left and center field.
Bonds has unlimited potential
and is solid all around. He plays
defense, can run, and hit for pow-
er. Van Slyke filled a big gap and
is one ()f the big reasons why we
made so much progress last year.

The shortstop spot is a question
mark. We'll take a look at Al Ped-
rique, Felix Fermin and Rafael
Belliard. I feel comfortable that all
three can catch the ball. I'm not
sure of their overall strength and
durability, so we will likely carry
at least two of the three.

I think Jose Lind is a blue chip-
per at second base. He's an out-
standing No. 2 hitter, he slaps the
ball around and can move the
runners up. Defensively, he has
outstanding range, probably as
good as any second baseman in
the National League.

Sid Bream has been the regu-
lar first baseman now for two
years. He suffered through a
slump last year, but he fought out
of it at the end, and I believe he
is a good defensive first baseman.

Spring training will be a con-
tinuing learning process at third
base for Bobby Bonilla. I think

It Mike LaValliere can perform
close to the way he did last year,
we would be very happy.

Mike Diaz is one of the most
valuable players in our club.

RJ. Reynolds served his play-
ing time as well as anyone last

Bloomburg’s Dave Morgan

official," Stottlemyer said. ”He
spends too much time jawing
with the referees instead of fight-
ing. It is something that he is go-
ing to have to change.”

Pitt’s Mike Rossi (18-15) was
able to turn the whole thing
around with one of his strongest
perfomances of the season.

Rossi took control of the match
in the second period on his way
to a momentum-gathering 8-4
win.

”I felt pretty confident going
into the match,” said Rossi. ‘'1 felt
him breaking down about the
middle of the second period.
That's when I knew that the
match was mine.”

Mike Tongel (23-13-1) con-
tinued the Pitt role with a strong
18-2 win.

‘'1 worked up a good sweat be-
fore the match, and that really
helped,” Tongel said. ’’I got my-
self going early and didn't let up.
I only wish that I could have done
a little more.”

Pitt won its final match of the
evening at 190 pounds. Perry

seemed that I knew what he was

The lead was short—lived as the
Huskies took the heavyweight
match and the meet with a 3-1
win.

”A loss is a loss, and it doesn’t
feel good,” Stottlemyer said. ’’I
thought that we could take one
of the early swing matches, but
the guys didn’t pull through. We
really should have won the
meet."

The Panthers are on the road
for their next two meets. On
Tuesday, they travel to Ohio to
face off against Kent State. Next
Sunday, Pitt goes to State College
to battle the Nittany Lions.

WANTED

Love
confession
from an
anthemaniac.

As you know, anthe-
maniacs like myself
just go crazy around
flowers. So what does
my Valentine send me
on Valentine's Day?
The FTD” Love Note
Bouquet!

Well, let me tell you,
when I saw those
beautiful flowers in
that fine porcelain
bowl it drove me wild.

Besides, this glorious
bouquet also came
with a note pad and
pencil with which I've
written my Valentine
every day.

And smart Valentines
know it doesn't cost
much to send us
anthemaniacs into
this flower frenzy.

Just ask your florist
to have FTD send
one for you.
