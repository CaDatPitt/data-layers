Eight Able Party-Candidatesl  
Elected to Next YeaI"s Senate 4

- By PAT POLLINO
Fiery John Vrana and his Able Party running mate, Ron Cimino,
won last Wednesday’s Student Government election with little trouble,
although a write—in campaign opposing the victor was reportedly at-

tempted. The unoﬁicial tally showed Vrana’s ’margin of victory at

about 7-1 over his closest write-in competition, whose name remained

' undisclosed.

Eight Able Party senatorsialso rode home victorious in the elec-
tion. The party ran _16 on its slate forsenatorial seats. Ten independ-
ents and ﬁve write-ins rounded out the. senatorial winners.

The able P-arty claimed ﬁve seats in the School of Liberal Arts.
Party winners were Pricilla Bijur, Joyce Diener, _Martin Engels, Bar-
bara Goodman and Bruce Martin. Independents elected were Marcia
Bernstein, Marsha Gordon, Elizabeth Lambie, Ferne Pitt, Dorothy
Scalise and Eleanor Shenesky. A

Party Seats One Engineer _, A -

Jerome Hogan was the party’s lone senator-elect in the School

of Engineering and Mines. Other seats went to James Janis, William _

King and. Phillip Phillips. .

There was ' no contest in the School of Education. Able
Party candidates‘ Kathy English and Janet McKeever copped
the two senate seats in that school. _ .

Write-in Frank Backus joins independent Howard Haberman as
senators from the School of Business Administration. Haberman had

. been the only candidate listed on the ballot in that division.

Senate positions in the Schools of Nursing and Pharmacy were
ﬁlled by write-ins. In nursing, the nod went ‘to Susan Druckemiller
and Roberta J. McIntosh; in pharmacy, it went to ‘Richard Bertin and
Gail Holroyd. . - .

The- present SG Senate will be dissolved at the end of the
term, and the new senate will begin operation in the spring term.

Vrana indicated that he and Cimino would begin working with
the present senate within the next few weeks. He believes that this
is a necessary step in effecting a successfuil transfer of duties atthe
end of the term. Operations foiﬁfall programs can then be worked
out during the summer, said .Vrana, at either periodic or regular
SG meetings. . . V A '
“Work Together” . ‘

“We,” he said, resting a hand on Cimino’s shoulder, “want to
get together with the n'ew senate, talk toseach senator individually,
ﬁnd out what they are interested in and work together’ toward those
goals.” - - -

President DeGaulle Lightly Treated

Mendes:-France Shuns Topic

‘ By Bill Niederberger

Mendes-France chose to ignore
the topic on everyone’s mind,
Charles de Gaulle, for about 35
of his slotted 50 minute talk at
Wednesday’s Midday Series in the
SU Ballroom. .

And even then he treated the
French President only obliquely,
using him asta personiﬁcation of
centralized governmental aconomic
control that Mendes-France feels
is unrealistic and detrimental to
a nation's economy.

His speech concentrated on
economic aspects of the .modern
democracy with a proliferation of
well-worked, terms like “go by our
convictions, extend the principles,
cause of human dignity.”

Great Power

Mendes-France’ maintains that
in a nation in an advanced stage
of economic development, the
power of decision cannot be put
in one hand. Today’s economic
policies are complex and the eco-
nomic decisions are 1ikewise‘com-
plex. To Mendes-France any at-
tempt to centralize economic de-
cisions ‘in one power is detri-
mental to the economy and health
of the nation. .

Eight Able Party Candidates r
Elected to Next Year’s Senate

(Continued from Page 1)

Vrana outlined a forceful stand which he hopes will ﬁnd the
approval of the newly-elected senate as representatives of the
student body. He «intends to press for an all-purpose identiﬁcation
card for students; adequate budget evaluations which meet‘ the
needs of student organizations; a judicial committee that will be
permanent and functioning, and policy-making committees com-
prised of capable students who will work with the administration.

The new president added that he will try to bring‘ the Polaris
under the authority of student publications, noting that it has been
on unsure grounds as an SG project. Vrana also will seek to institute
a concept of “victory varieties.” r ‘

SG-Sponsored Celebrations ,.

“Victory varities,” explained Vrana, “will consist of SG-spon-
sored celebrations following a number of University events — ath—"
letic or otherwise.” ’ ' ’

T Vrana earmarked “coorperation and unity in the University"

as a goal that must be realized if Student Government is to func-
tion properly. He looks hopefully forward to ‘~‘a strong Student
Government supported by other organization and — most of
all the student body.” A

A junior English writing major, Vrana is presently businessman-
ager of The 1964 Owl. He is a member gt‘ Omicron Delta Kappa,
Druids, Pi Delta Epsilon and Phi Eta Sigma. He was named Sopho-
more Man of the Year for 1962-63 and was editor of last year’s
Polaris.

Vice president Cimino is a junior in economics. He is presently
an SG senator, an SG ‘representative to the Athletic Committee

.(policy—making body of the .University’s Athletic Department), a

member of the Executive Board of Sigma Chi, a member of the
varsity football team and a 'member of Druids.

  Teachers for Deaf Sought;

There is ‘a search for -15 college graduates who want to study at
the University to become teachers of the deaf. 'R1eir ‘expenses will

teachers for deaf children.

Last year only. 50 qualiﬁed people were available to ﬁll 500
open teaching posts at the country’s schools and residential centers
for the deaf, according to Dr. Godfrey Stevens, who heads the Uni-
versity’s program in Special Education and Rehabilitation. Stevens’
department will provide the training for the candidates now being
sought.’ '

The group will enter the graduate program in September and
complete it three trimesters later in August of, 1965, earning the
'master’s degree in special education.’ Included in the training will
be a supervised teaching experiment under Dr. Samuel A. Craig at
the Western Pennsylvania School‘ for the Deaf.

Officers Elected, Moral Question  
Debated by Men’sDor1n Council

By AL JANEZIC

What began as a dinner-meeting
to elect ofﬁcers, resulted in a
lengthy moral debate at the Wed-

’nesday evening meeting of Men's

Dorm Council. -

_ Midway through a routine
meeting, a spirited discussion de-
veloped between the Council and
John Bender, assistant to the di-
rector of men’s housing, concern-

‘ ing the “open door policy” en-

: inuendos about the conduct during

forced at house parties. Bender
stated that "because of what he
termed “a million complaints and

dorm parties, the honors system
that had been in eﬁect was being

abandoned for “something work-

able.”

The new policy, he said, was
formulated after discussion with
dormitory counselors‘ and staffs of

the Dean of Men and Dean of
Women. It states that doors on the ’

ﬂoor on which a party is held must

= be completely open. Nohalf-open.

or closed doors will be permitted.
Also, persons attending parties
must remain in the lounge area of

the house until 11:30 p.m.’ Parties‘

will end at 12:30 a.m.
The questionand new policy
were discussed by Council with
numerouswsuggestions put forth.
fAmong these were going back to‘
the honors system and taking
stern action, with violators. ‘It
was pointed out that other col-
leges and ‘universities through-
out thecountry seem to have
more’ liberal policies than the
University. . '
Pete»Bijur,' speaking for Coun-
ci1,'said, “I believe that 90% of
the inuendos reported‘ are false.

. Further,‘ I propose that a com-

 

 

’. settle the‘ question.”

mittee be set up to discuss and
Bijur». ex-
plained that plans will be made
in the next week to lay the ground
rules for forming a committee, for
a reportto be given at Wednes-
day’s meeting.“ If appropriate, a
committee can be set up at that
time, he said.

Preceding the party-rules dis-

vice president when two other
nominees, Joe Centafanni and Pete

The two other officers of_the

That this attempthfailed can be attributed to one of two reasons.
The ﬁrst being that the campaign was begun too late and was too poorly ,
organized to achieve any result, and the second‘ reason being that the
student body is beginning to accept a little responsibility for the workings
of SG and didn’t want to witness another Elmer Merkowsky ﬁasco. '

For those of you too young to remember, three years ago a last
minute write in campaign was organized and carriedthrough by a group
of students trying to have some fun. A fellow named Elmer Merkowsky
was elected in a hilarious campaign which ruined SG for the entire year.
He was declaredinelligible because of grades and Richard Soboda took‘ 1
/ofﬁce by default. Withsuch support from the student body it’s no wonder
that SG was almost voted off campus at the end of that year. ‘ .;‘

independently, to, make’ decisions
with international repercussions,
and to do so with little consid-
eration for his western allies.

 His abrupt recognition of the
‘I. ,,People’s Republic of China as

‘, the legitimate government of the
Chinese people attests‘ to the
character of his ornery, unilateral
_de"cisions. . i ' "1

cal, economic, and legal reasons
.why Charles de Gaulle might
feel recognition of Communist

 China is in the interests of France.
,r.._‘Increased trade with Red China,
' “adding to the French economy IS

just one possibility. '
- Judging from the abruptness of
his decision, however, this act of
recognition was not handled in
a manner that gave any"consid—
eration to his allies, particularly
the United States.
» The State Department of the
l’American government can list
‘many reasons why the govern-
ment of Mao—Tse—Tung should not
lbe recognized. Just one of the

‘- , many is the argument that roc-

 ognition will further’ the strength
and legitimacy of the Communist
cause in southeast Asia. "

Then again, the state depart-
ment is acting only as a highly
important pressure group when
considered on a world scale. The
state department obviously has no
legal power to restrain de Gaulles
actions. ’ ' '

The questions at hand then is
not whether Red China. is ‘de-
serving of French recognition.
Rather, the important point re-
mains whether French recogni-
tion at this particular ‘moment

i "and in such an abrupt manner
 was in the interest of the inter-

national position of the western
allies. '

Even those western commenta-
tors who do favor recognition of
Red China, do not seem to ap-

4* prove of any side effects of this

act which would tend to pro-

The Gambling Man-III

In a downtown." pool hall, ‘abou‘t 7.p.m. every
night, a man who I’ll' call John Smith makes his

appearance. Mr. Smith is about '50 years old. He_ .

does. not work for a living, but he is always im-

peccably ‘dressed in the prevailing styles, and has ~

sent his two sons through college. Several years
ago, Mr. Smith retired from the highest echelon
..of the ‘gambling business, spread-making.

Gambling, like most other businessies has its f

own status system. On" the lowest rung of the
ladder is the runner, a man who is hired by a

' bookie for about $75 a week. The runner’s job is
to collect bets for the bookie, who in most cases
does not want any contact with the bettor.

The bookie is second in line. In reality, he can
be compared to a stock broker. The stock broker
handles investments on business ﬁrms, and the
bookie handles investments on various sporting
events. While most bookies show an attitude of
independence, their success or failure depends en-
tirely on the abilities of the spreadmaker.

- Mr. Smith told me “Spreadmaking is very de-
manding. You have to be ggod in order to survive.
You have to know more‘about these teams than
any ﬁve bettors- combined. The whole gambling
business depends on you.” -

The object of spreadmaking is to make the
basketball or football game theoretically even.
Most people who follow basketball know that
Pitt_ is better than Dartmouth, but knowing
whether Pitt is better than Dartmouth with 28
points is a different story. It then becomes clifﬁcult
for the bettor to pick a winner, which is exactly
what the bookies want. ‘

To anyone who has indulged in betting, it is
also obvious that the spreadmakers know more
than the' bettor. About a month ago, Louisiana
State was scheduledto play a game at Loyola of
Neworleans. Loyola of New--Orleans loses very

Maybe things have taken a turn for the better. We would like to
thing so. Because of the ease with which Merkowsky was elected three
years ago, we would like to believe that the rason for the'failure of
this year’s write in was not due to mechanical diﬁiculties on the part of
the conspirators. We would like to believe that the real reason was
that the student body is just plain sick and tired of cheap politics, incom-
petents in ofﬁce, and dirty elections.

Wewould like to believe that the matter in which the referrendum
was handled two weegs ago has taught some people a lesson. We would
like to believe that the newly elected SG is going to be the starting point
for an era of clean, responsible government in this school.

campaign and the referendum could be held ﬁrst. J = - .

That this attempt did not succeed in, a credit to the student body.
Perhaps this isthe beginning of some clear sailing for government on

The incident I have described above is; an
example of one of the spreadmakers’ favorite

tricks, false spreading. False spreading is making a '
_ small spread in a game between a’ superior team

and an inferior team. On paper, the superior team
should romp, but there are usually several factors

going against them — the oiﬁciating, injuries, etc.

The average bettor sees the small spread, thinks
the game is_a give away, and bets his moneyion
the supposedly superior team". He usually winds
up surprised and broke. A

In the past two weeks, I have been forced out
of wagering action. During this time, I have made
my own point spreads for the basketball games.

It is diﬁicult and demanding. However, due to my .

knowledge of the abilities of thevarious teams, I
have been fairly accurate. Now, if I can only colfne

Conducting, Studies

By LARRY BERNFELD

“ 3? Unfortunately, no one’ as yet has devised a
crystal ball that will predict the future accurately
and without fail.

Dr. Jiri Nehnevajsa, chairman of the University
department of Sociology, however, is presently
working on a massive methods project designed to
provide a system for predicting the most likely out-
comes of future events.

2 This study, named “Project Outcomes”, is one

..« , of the four studies which Dr. Nehnevajsa is present-

ly directing from his staff headquarters on the

‘ twelfth ﬂoor of Tower C, the male’ graduate estu-

dent’s dormitory. Project Outcomes is a study of

international scope dealing with,issues such "as the A

Cold War, and Disarmament.

-Four Studies Simultaneously

A second study deals with essentially the same
‘topics, but this time on a national scale. A third
study is oriented toward determining the impact
j\ of Civil Defense on sogjety, in such terms as its
value and organization.‘A fourth study, known as
“Project Futures” deals with the future ‘of South

American Columbia in 1970. . , .

I All four of Dr‘. Nehnevajsa’s projects have
certain. features‘ in “common. All deal with the
futures of a particular problem. The emphasis,
in each case, is'on' the alternatives through which
the problem can be resolved. Each" of the projects

. ,4 , also dealwitli the impact of special events, and
V how theyaffect people. Nehnevajsa cited as ex-
amples, the U2 incident, the Berlin Wall, and the
assassination of President Kennedy. ’ ’

Finally; all projects have the responsibility of

developing methods for studying something that
hasn’t happened yet. ‘ '

All four projects have access to 300 previous
studies done on methodsand the future. The infor-

. mation' from these studies are stored _on 400,000

in light of present developments. These potential futures have been
designed “outcomes,” hence, the name ofthe project. . ii .

I ‘ Future ‘Vary ‘

The decision maker sees that futures vary in availability; likeli-
hood" of each, anddesirability of alternatives, and their affects on
other people related to the situation. , . \

Speciﬁc crises have beeir examined in the course of the iproj-' .
ect’s_ research, and the set of futures have varied with each_issue
under study. However, Dr. Nehnevajsa stated, “the basic observa-
tions A-made upon each ‘of the possible futures remain the same

on’ System A to Predict Futurei

, imposed on the problem at hand. “We may probe

ent, we must seek to understand the future.” ‘

’ ‘Iy.”"

     
 
 

Speciﬁc or general timing may then be super-_ .

the likelihood of drifts toward communism within_
a year, or two, or ﬁve, or ever.”

Affects of Alternatives

“People expect various things to happen.” They
are diversely affected by the probabilities to the
alternatives they consider might determine a future '_ 1
state of affairs. Such alternatives vary in role‘ _
importance, degree of sensitivity with which they S‘ '
affect different individual, and limit the kinds of.‘ If
actions from which a choice will be made.

 
 

While speciﬁc solutions are secondary to the
methods for future analysis, the alternatives
within each action are signiﬁcant. “Actions im- e (

...i-ages -——'*r‘nE’r1*r'r"Nr:ws — nanay, Marchi 2. 1964 [

.0fficials, Penn

By ART FLEISCHNER

Penn State basketball coach John Egli has

., been advocating a plan whereby the game
wofild be played without officials. It would be
on the honor system, the players calling their
own fouls. Saturday night was a perfect time to put

the plan into effect.

The Panthers lost to Penn State, 78-63, before
5800 partisan fans and two partisan officials. It wasn’t
so much that the oflicials wanted Penn State to win,

--but Pitt had won earlier in the year, so why not make

" it even and nobody’s feelings would be hurt.

IAfter all, Pitt was going to the NIT and it didn’t
,make any difference if they lost one more game. They
would still have a 17-7 record. Penn State would be
14-7 with two games remaining and a chance to make
the NIT, despite all that athletic director Ernie McCoy

could do by scheduling 15 of 23 games on the road.’

Referees Stan Noszka and Tony Senapole should
make McCoy think twice about the value of playing
. . at home. It wasn’t that they became partial, they

  State R

 

just forgot about calling fouls on State for about ten
minutes in the second half.

During this time Paul Krieger, Dave Sauer and
Brian Generalovich fouled out. Ron Avillion and Tom
Malinchak also fouled out for State.

The referees controlled the game about as well
as Sonny'Liston controlled Cassius Clay.

Egli said, “I’ve never seen anybody as up for a
gameas our boys.” Egli didn_’t look at Panther coach
Bob Timmons. Timmons was up more than he was
on the bench. E

“I hate to see a game where the officials don’t
have control,” said Timmons. “West Virginia was bad
enough. One of‘ these games a year is too many. To-
night wasn’t as bad as at Morgantown, ‘but it did
ruin what could have been a good game.”

Egli, who has complained about the officiating in
the last four games between the two schools, three. of
which State lost, said with a wink, “The officiating

was all right.” .

Getting serious he added, “There’s not much more

I_can say about the referees than to get ridof them. ’

The players were a littletense in the first half and,

as a result were committing fouls.” . ’
Timmons refused to blame the officials for the loss

saying, “Penn State was more aggressive and hungrier

than we were tonight. They played good defense and

got the second and third shot. And they rebounded

better than we did.”
The loss was the first of the year for the Panthers
against a zone defense. “A major factor was the in-

ability of Dave Roman and Dave Sauer to hit from

the outside.

Timmons plans to give the team a few days rest.
Pitt has at least ten days before they play again in
the NIT. It is still not decided who its opponent will
be. Only six of the 12 teams have been selected for
the tournament. V

Theloss to the Nittany Lions probably‘ means that
the Panthers“ will not be seeded in the NIT. Their
inabilityltol win on the road this year was a major
reason. They only win ﬁve of 12 games away from
Fitzgerald ‘Field House. _

. _ During the regular season last year they won nine
if 12 on the road. The other two losses came at home.

Gym Team Defeats WVU InSeasonFinal    

By FRED BERLIN

“This -season the victories came few and far between,”
said Panther gym coach Warren Neiger. “But next year
things should be a lotdifferent.” Neiger made the com-
ment Saturday night after his squad defeated West Vir-
ginia in its ﬁnal duel meet, 57-39. ‘ V

The win was only the second of the year for_ the Panthers
as against six defeats. '

Actually the Panthers performed well enough against the
Mountaineers to have defeated a number of teams as they turned
in what proved to be .a more than adequate effort. In so doing
they swept every event except the still rings and the ﬂoor ex-
ercise.

‘ Panther .captain Ed Stim did the most individual scoring.
Competing on the side horse, horizontal bar, _parallel’"bar, and
long horse he turned in scores of 8.75, 9.15, 8.3, and 8.95,.v'respec-

“You can’t expect your sophomores to win the big

‘ ones for you,” commented‘ Penn State coach Charlie

Speidel after histeam dropped its third dual meet of
of the season Saturday night at Fitzgerald House, 19-11‘.
Hewas referring to his sophomores Joe Eremus and Eller'y;Seitz.«

Eremus, _who had an impressive 4-1 record before Satur- .
day’s match, couldn’t handle the Panthers’ Tom Bailyas Baily
continued undefeated’ at home. ‘ x '

The 157 pounders dueled in the closest match of the meet
with Baily coming out the victor, 2-0. Baily escaped from Ere-
mus at 2:30 of the final period for one .point and got the other
‘point for havirigjridden Eremus for the entire sec'6nd period.
Baily’s win gaveethe Panthers an 11-5 lead. '

Speidel’s other sophomore, Seitz, dropped his match to Ken
Barr in the 191-pound division. Seitz scored the first. takedown
"of the night for the Lions, an unusual statistic since he'was in
the eighth match of the evening. _ _ V '

The match was‘ very important for if Barr hadn't won, the
score going into the ﬁnal match would have been, 16-11‘, and
would have given the Lions a chance to tie with a pin. 2

The only pin of the meet came at a very crucial moment
for the Panthers. With the score only 11-8 in favor of the Pan'-
thers, -Lee Hall pinned Mike Gill in the 177-pound bout at 8:18. _

The .most -controversial fmatch of the night was the 167-
pound bout’ between Marty Strayer and ‘Clair Riley. The ref-
eree gave two -points to Strayer by calling stalling on Riley.
Strayer is regarded as"tl_ie best 167 pounder in the East‘ and '
Riley was wrestling thirty pounds above his normal weight.

Speidel was a little perturbed about the match since he was
hoping for a pin by Strayer. “Ithink Riley was deﬁnitely stall-
ing and I think if ‘a boy isn’t going to mix it up he shouldn’t
be out on the mat.” - -

Panther/Coach Rex Peery just laughed off the charges saying,’
“If Strayer is supposed to be thelbest in the East then its his
job_to get Riley turned over on his back.”

In the other matches Frank O’Korn ended the season un-
defeated at 137-pdunds by beating Glenn Thiel, 6-2, Mike John-
son defeated Mark Piven, 7-2, and.is undefeated in his dual
meet career. Tom Heniff was able to tie highly-rated Jay Wind-

‘ felder, 4-4, in the 123—pound match, while Dino Boni lost his

second straight at 147-pounds, to George Edwards, and Bill Beck
was beaten at heavyweight by Don McKenna.

. _ Others who followed Stim’s scoring example were Dave Mc-
K_mn1s with an 8.5 on the still rings and John Franchuk with an
8.8 on the parallel bars. Al Leonard posted an 8.95 on the long‘

horse while Jack Schwarcame through with an 8.5 in the same .

event- ’

The only decent efforts turned in for the Mountaineers were f
by Pittsburgher Jerry Spencer. Spencer, who competed. in all six

events, won two of them. ‘ ' _
Aside from Spencer’s showing,- the Mountaineers were al-

most unbelieveably poor. Looking as if -they were competing for j

the ﬁrst time, most of them seemed to be merely‘ going through
the motions. ' , . ‘

On the parallel bars,.the horizontal bars, and the side horse,
in fact. West ‘Virginia competitors fell off’ before completing their
routines. ”

Considering thevearly ‘season injuries which brought about j

the severe lack‘ of depth, the Panthers’--record wasn’t really too bad. _

Intramural Basketball Playoffs
Set to Get Underway This Wepelc

By BILL CABIN,

Intramural basketball championships
are set to begin either tonight or tomorrow
night according to assistant IM director
Tom Jones.

Titlists have been decided in all but
two of the six leagues. In the Independent
League Bruno’s Boys will meet the Drif-
ters as will the two teams tied for the lead
in the Fraternity A League, Sigma Chi and
Delta Sigma Phi, to determine winners, of
those leagues. '

In the championship. playoffs the Fraternity
A winner will meet the winner of the Frater-
nity B League, Pi Kappa Alpha, the Dorm
League winner, Winbrook, will face the In-
dustrial Engineers and the Dental League
champs, the Major Connectorsand the Inde-
pendent League winner will get byes.

The Major Connectors captured the Dental
League championship last iweek with a 56-47
defeat of the Plumbers. Although both teams
played good on offense and defense, the Major
Connectors had too much scoring power for the

Plumbers. Miles Ranck led the victors with 13.
points and Byron Justus and Gus Oakley also

had 12 and 10 points, respectively. Harold Wrig-

A RAOBE‘ BY ANY OTHER NAME

With the Commencement Day just a couple of short months
away, the question on everyone’s lips is: “How did the differ-
ent disciplines come to be marked by academic robes with
hoods of different colors?” Everybody is asking it; I mean
ever_1/body! I mean I haven’t been able to walkten feet on
any campus without somebody grabs my elbow and says, “How
did the different disciplines come to be marked by academic
robes with hoods of -different colors, hey?” ’ -' ‘

This, I must say, is not the usual question asked by colle-
gians who grab my elbow. Ordinarily they say, “Hey, Shorty,
got a Marlboro?” And this is ﬁtting. After all, are they not
collegians and therefore loaded with brains? And does not
intelligence demand the tastiest in tobacco ﬂavor? And does
not Marlboro deliver a. ﬂavor that is uniquely delicious? And
am I not short? I

But I digress. Back to the colored hoods of academic robes.’

A doctor of philosophy wears blue, a doctor of medicine wears _

lily. Tilly/7

green, 9., master of arts wears white, a doctor of humanities
wears crimson, a master of librar science wears lemon yellow.
Why‘? Why, for example, shoul a. master’ of library science
wear lemon yellow‘? _ _ /

Well sir, to answer this vexing question, we must go back to
March 14,1844. On that date the ﬁrst public library in the
United States was established by Ulrich Sigafoos. All of Mr.
Sigafoos’s neighbors were of course wildly grateful—all, that
is, excgpt Wrex Todhunter. '

Mr. Todhunter had hated Mr. Sigafoos since 1822 when both

, men had wooed the beautiful Melanie Zitt and Melanie had
f chosen Mr. Sigafoos because she was mad for dancing and Mr.

Sigafoos knew all the latest steps——like the Missouri Com-
promise Samba, the Shays’ Rebellion Schottische, and. the
James K. Polk Polka—while Mr. Todhunter, alas, could not
dance at all, owing to a. wound he had received at the Battle
of New Orleans. (He was struck by a. falling praline.)

Consumed with jealousy at‘ the success of Mr. Sigafoosh
library, Mr. Todhunter resolved. to open a competing library.
This he did, but he lured not one single patron away from,
Mr. Sigafoos. “What has Mr. Sigafoos got that I have not?’5
Mr. Todhunter kept asking himself, and ﬁnally the answer
came to him: books. . v

So Mr. Todhunter stocked his library with lots of lovely
books, and soon he was doing more business than his hated rival.
But Mr. Sigafoos struck back. To regain his clientele, he_began.
serving tea, at his library everyafternoon. Thereupon Mr.
Todhunter, not to be outdone, began serving tea with sugar
Thereupon Mr. Sigafoos began serving tea with sugar and
cream. Thereupon Mr. Todhunter began serving tea with sugar
and cream and lemon.

This, of course, clinched the victdry for Mr. Todhunter
because he had the only lemon tree in town-—in fact, in the
entire state of Maine—and since that day lemon yellow has,
of course, been the color on the robes of masters. of library
science.

(Incidentally, the defeated Mr. Sigafoos packed up his li-
brary and moved to California where, alas, he failed once more.
There were, to be sure, plenty of lemons to serve with his tea,
but, alas, there was no cream because the cow was not intro-
duced to California until 1937 by John Wayne.)
