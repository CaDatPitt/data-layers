ROTC Band Presents" . "

Annual Concert Tl1isEvening

Lockhart Directs;
Program To Include
ebussy, . Bach
By ROBERT BROWN
Following the precedent estab-
lished last year, the"University
ROTC Band will give its annual
home concert -this evening in
Carnegie IMusi_c Hall as one of
the principal features _of.Spr_ing Festi-

val Week. Lee M. Lockhart, director "

of instrumental music at the Univer-
sity, will conduct the program which

is scheduled to begin at 8:15 o’clock, «

In keeping with its tradition Osva-

riety concerts, the band wi_ll,pres_ent '

numbers that range from one of Jo-"
hann Sebastian Bach’s greatest fugues
to several of Mr. Lockhart’s arrange-
ments of campus songs and"n1ar.ches.
In addition, the group’s solo organi-
zation, the trombone quartet, will
play several arrangements of popular
tunes and melodies, with John Shir-
ley, C37, first trombonist and student
director of the band, as featured solo-
ist of the evening. Shirley will play
a. number entitled, “Atlantic Zephyrs,”
with full band accompaniment.

 Debussy Included

Other numbers scheduled on this

evening’s ~perfo"rmance" yinclude two
Debussy_ transcr.ip‘t"ions,, , “The .Girl
With the Flaxen Hair,” and the “Gol-
liwog’s Cakewalk;” “Headl_ines,” by
Colby; selections from “The Mikado,”
and a larghetto‘ movement from
Beethoven’s,second Syl‘l1'plt¢:)Il‘tyf ' A

The Bach transcription is from one
of the German masterls organ.wo_1-ks,
and is oneof the great numbers in

‘the literature of that instrument. It

is a‘ difficult work to play, with plen-
ty "of scale runs in the Woodwinds,
heavy chords for the brass, while even
the"three tubas have to struggle with
a devilish---passage of arpe'ggio's.-The
music runs on and on like a cleverly
constructed mathproblem, and ends
with a great piling-up eﬂ"ect‘"tliat is
characteristic of Bach. , _
Entirely different is the “G0lliwog’s
Cake Walk,” written by Debussy for
inclusion in his Childre'n’s Suite for

Dr. J-ame’s Explains"

Scholars-sHere A

“The University of Pittsburgh is
too specialized ever to develop“ a
Rhodes scholar,” believes Dr. Alfred
P. James, professor of history and
.University representative on the
,.Rho:des Scholarship beard.
"’ A Rhodes scholar must be an all-
aroundanagn possessing abilities above
average invscholarship, activities and

ities are chosen by a ‘board and given
scholar-ships for from one -to three
years at any En_glish_Universit-y.
“But men at metropolitan univer-
sities ﬁnd competition so keen in any
one of the three ﬁelds that they are
forced to .- specialize in-= either... activ-
ities, athletics o_r.s"cl1olars‘hip. It is too
(liﬁicult, in-fact, almost impossible, for
a man to have experience in all three.
There just. isn't time to engage-~i11
them all. Exceptioiial men manage to

ﬁelds, either activities or athletics, and
scholarship. ' ,

John Tibbey, C85, "possessed one of
the best records of any University
candidate for a Rhodes Scholarship.
But as Dr. James pointed out, he had
a—n-excellent record in scholarship and
ac-tivit;ics,_but;hi‘s atliletic record was

almost‘ n'il".’

this anyhow.) Pray that ‘it doesn't

rain. Clean your last summer’s white

money. And clear the calendar for
Spring Festival.

Collected To Finish a  .

Retail Research Bureauis

Quarters , By September

. Pittsburgh Department Stores,
Have Contributed $l8,000
For Cathedral's l9+h Floor

A total of $18,000 has been contributed by Pittsburgh depart-
ment stores for the completion of. the 19th floor of the Cathedral.
This ﬂoor will be the permanent headquarters of the Research
Bureau for Retail Training. Constru.cti0n work was begun this
week on the section, and if present plans are completed the new

rooms will be ready for occupancyé

next September.

According to an announcement
made Wednesday by Bishop Brown,
director of the Bureau, the contribut-
ing stores include: Boggs & Buhl,
Frank & Seder, Gimbel Brothers,
Joseph Horne Company, McCreery &
Company, Rosenbaum Company,
l\Ieyer Jonasson & Company, and
Kaufmann’s Department Store.

Floor Plans Completed

Floor plans for the new section of
13,124 square feet have been com-
pleted under the supervision of Gus-
talph Ketterer, interior architect of
the Cathedral. The layout includes a
reception room, a director’s office and
conference room, a mailing and mim-
eographing room, and individual of-
fices. Adjoining the elevator lobby will
be the lounge. A classroom, locker
room, library, and study room will
be the center of student activities‘.

The Bureau laboratory, furnished
with movable equipment, will be
adapted for use of moving pictures,
model window and counter displays,
fashion shows, ‘textile exhibits, and re-
search work. ‘

Bureau Endowed V

In 1923, the Bureau was perma-»
nently endowed by the merchants and
moved to the University. For nine
years it occupied a red brick_ house
on Frick Acres, one of ‘the buildings
torn down to make way for the con-
struction of Heinz Chapel. The Bu-
reau moved to its present offices on
the 11th ﬂoor of the Cathedral ‘in the
fall of 1932.

Twenty-one students, representing

eleven different colleges and universi-

ties, and eight special store students
are at present enrolled in the Bu-
reau course.

Spring Festival
(Continued from Page 1)

Pitt Riﬂes, a dart throw—-to mention
but a few.

Students are to entertain on ‘the
Varsity Night program on a stage
erected on the plaza. The program is
scheduled to begin at 9 o’clock and
run for a half hour, after which there
will be an intermission of a half hour;
the en'tertainment will then be re-
sumed until 10:30 o’clock.

The singing groups from the ZTA
and ThTA women’s fraternities; Jim
Reagan, magician; the University
trombone quartet; the Glee Club Var-
sity Quartet; and an act from the
Cap and Gown show have been signed
up.

Reviews

iword Etchingsi

By MILTON LEHMAN

We have just come upon “Word
Etchi_ngs,” annual project of the
freshman literary unit, and we are
pleased. . . ~ .

Although the 20-page publication
is rather obviously composed of bet-
'ter—than-average English themes, the
editorial selection speaks well for the
magazine. Then, too, there are poem:
that just as obviously could not come
from the English ﬁles, and they are
good. '~

“Word Etchings” may be nothiijrg
more than an indication of things to
come, but the indication speaks well
for the unit. According to the edi-
torial by Estelle Kovacs, chairman of
the unit, the group is “an organiza-
tion made up each year of freshman
womenxwho enjoy writing.”

Includes Poetry

The magazine is composed largely
of sketches, long themes, and short
iinagistic bits of poetry. “Lady Preci-
ous-Stream” by Alice Benovitz suc-
cessfully discusses little known facts
about the Chinese theater; Anne Ro-
mansky’s “Brief-Cases and Hot Pres-
sing” is a well-drawn character sketch,
although it seems to move a little
too swiftly.

Anna Colaizzi’s “Mrs. Denster,”
another character bit, brings the
reader into contact with the writer
through the use of rhetorical ques-
tions; Mary Roche’s “Little Night” is
a sensitive sketch showing a ﬁne in-
trospection. ‘

Among the other longer and short-
er sketches, all of which have a pro-
pensity for description, are Mary"
Letsche’s _. “Dark Hollow,” Charlotte
Norris’ “Roo1n Five,” Miss Kovacs’
“Character,” Mildred Akselrad’s “My
Kid Sister,” and Lillian Schreiner’s
“Dishwashing.” Elizabeth E. Foster’s
“Menus Lisus” is a splendid analysis
of one of the more prominent mem-
bers of the English department.

The poems, too, are refreshing, and
yet we may be dissatisﬁed with the
consistency of vers libre. Some might
prefer more of the rhymed and me-
tered verse—but that is‘ a matter 0
personal opinion. . '

At any rate, the performances of
Miss Foster, Ruth Fearson, Miss Ko-
vacs, and Ruth Scott are good. They
reveal an awareness for. clear cut
images. . ,

The publication was originally dis-
tributed at the freshman Mother’s

-Tea. According to Chairman Kovacs,

copies may be obtained at "Heinz
House. . .

Language Banquet

Dr. Whitford H. Shelton, head and
professor of modern languages, Mrs.
Shelton, M. A. DeVitis, associate pro-
fessor of modern languages, and Mrs.
DeVitis have been invited to attend
the annual, banquet _, .of language
groups at Seton Hill College this eve-
ning.

A committee headed by Stewart has
worked all semester on plans for the

Education Students Get
l1 Teachings.

University Group
Leads Class Sessions
Af Schenley High
By ROBERT GETTIGO
With more than half the semester
behind them, Pitt education seniors
now doing their student teaching at
Schenley high school are beginning to
wonder if teaching is quite as easy
as i't looked from the outside.
~ - One hundred and ten are enrolled
in the teaching course, which carries
eight full credits and a grade that
means a lot to high school principals.
Of these, seven men and seven women
are in physical education work, while
ten are registered in elementary
schools. Their subjects cover a wide
range. Most~ popular-—-are commei-cial~
education, with an enrollment of 34,
and history, with 28. Latin is repre-
sented by only four student teachers;
German by six.  A ‘.4; ff
; Other ﬁelds,‘ according to Dr.
George Gould, director of practice
teaching» rank as follows: English_——
23'; social .s‘c'ience—-10; French-"8;
matl1emati_cs-.—14; and seience.—'—-_2,5;.,'
 ~ Faculty '_._Supervises H i'_i
5: Faculty ineinbers from ‘the’ Univer-
sity act as ‘supe1'ViS01‘s,; and as the P.
T.’s (school of education jargon for
“practice teacl_c’_iers”_) . will sadly tell
you, they always choose the most "in-
opportune times "for their visits. V
Supervisors include. Miss Geyer’ in
English; Dr.. Hutson in history; M-r.
De Vitis. in ’n_,1,,odern , language; Dr.
Stinchcomb in Latin; Mr. Lessenberry
in Commercial-jsubjects‘; Dr. Culver
in mathematics ;. Dr.’ S. H. W,illi_ams
in science; ._Mr. Dambach in ' inen’s
physical edu'_cation~; and Miss Rearick

in women’s physical edu__cation.In ad-

dition to supervisors, student teach-
ers are rated by ‘their critic teachers,

‘of whom there are 41 this semester,‘

and by Dr. Gould himself.

Do they like it-?~-A-stto the great” -

inajority——yes! Amusing incidents
happen sometimes to take their minds
off their troubles. One student teach-»
er, well known on the campus, got a
red face soon a.fter the semester got
under way when he shot a question
at one of the more mature young
,l_ad_ies.of_h'is history class—“,What is_
the graduated income ‘tax, Miss So-
a.,I_i"d—so?" Because she wasn’t paying

attention, thebright young lady came _

back with: “I don't know, Mr. ;
what is the graduated income tax?”
; He didn.’t know. . .
Another too-bright student amazed
:.Vincent Galbreath, Ed37, beyond
words the other day when, in re-
sponse to the question, “How did
Louis XVI lose his head?”-—blurted
out, “He lost his head over a woman !”
Galbreath is still telling his friends
about that one. ~

Gould Sounds Warning;
“Practice teaching,” says Dr.
Gould, “differs from all o'ther univer-
sity courses in that responsibility is
placed squarely on the shoulders of
the student. Occasionally, a beginning
teacher ﬁnds difficulty in making this

adjustment.” ~
This correspondent, being one of
the ‘teachers himself, can verif_v this
statement, and can add a comment of

his own. For years we of the educa— '

tion group have been crabbing about
this and that teacher, and what we’d
do if we were in their place. Now
our wish has come true. And we can"t
help wondering to ourselves just
what these Schenley people must be
saying about us! .

Festival C hatter . . . -
With all this talk about'_SP1‘i_.nz‘=’
going 4on,Hwe thought we mightdas
wellchime in with our nickel_’s worth"
and do‘a"_little bit about Spring F85‘
tivals,‘ past a'r'1'd‘pre‘sent.“ ‘
‘Two years‘ ago" the Festival had
two‘ traditions; lﬁrizly it 8-lW9«Y5.
3-ai'n¢d',‘ and second, at‘ Delt was al;
ways'chai‘rVr'nan. And in 1935» '1?
ra"ii1ed‘i’.lor‘-'a‘ll‘ but a few m-inutes -—
of the entire four-day stretch. The
skies" were ‘clear "only" While the
Sweepstakes were being run.
As far as chairmen were con-
cerned, -Bob Willison, a good Delt,
But in 1936, one of these tradi-
tions was compgletvely shattered. The
weather was“pe‘rfect from Wednes-
dziy_"tln'ougl1 ‘Saturday, and “every
out—of-doors event went on as sched-
uled. Still, tradition is a hard thing‘
to break away "front. . . So Chuck,
Allcroft, also a good Delt, was chair-
man. i ' . ’
Already this year, the one re’-
maining sine qua ' non ' has“ been
thrown into discard. Louis Bearer,
a "non-fraternity inilan, no "less," has
ended the‘ Deltfdynasty" and has
p|"eparecl' the',\d'ra.y for the COP“:
to‘ put ' it Egyptologically. 1
New Twists . . . .
Every year, it" seems, the , cl1air-
man adds anew twist or two to the
program. This ti'1‘n’e‘it’s a series of
novelty races in which a leap-frog
scramble and a hoop-race have been
added to the old "standby, the three-
legged race. ‘ '
.’But we'll stick to the original
Festival "product, the 'event— for
which fraternities train months in
advance." We're referring, of
course,’_to the Sweepsithkes. "
It brings out the‘ in'here“nt. blood-
thirstiness ’ of college students, beyond
any shadow of doubt. Upsets are fre-
quent,‘ and quite often have alarm-
ing consequences. But it’s worth all
that to seetliree or four _big huskies
come tearing -"down-; the home
stretch, each man shoving? his team's.
cart foriall he’s worth. ' —

Everybody In . . .

A-They tell us every house on
campus is entering a car"this"year.
If so, it will" be unusual," since
there. have "always been i only ‘eiigiht
or ten ‘in the race.  i'n’p'as‘t
years, the course had a sharp turn .
off" Center Ayenu"e onto‘ Dithridge
Street.‘Jl'n the last two ye'ars,'thi's
has: been eliminated, and it": ‘a safe
bet that every ‘vehicle. ﬁnishes. ‘

Of "course, any one student can see .

only a small fraction ‘ofithe race;
but mass ' enthusiasm "reaches its
highest pitchiin the beribboned crowd
lining the Sweepstakes course every

Events While Piii C
Holds Track Edge

When two good track teams get to-
gether, the meet is certain to be of
the “won-by-a-nose" variety. That’s
the only prediction that may be made
about the dual m_ect_ at South Bend
Saturday when Pitt meets Notre
Dame in their annual cinder clash.

Comparing records, which is a
somewhat accurate pastime, the two
teams look approximaatcly even. Pitt.
has‘ a substantial edge in the track
events, but the Irish have a deﬁnite
superiority in the weight and other
ﬁeld events. G ~ '

Notre Dame's record this "season
shows a first place inthe Central In-
tercollegiate Cliainpionships held in-
doors this past winter. Pitt finished
fifth in the same competition. The
Panthers, however, have been going
with full’ speed ahead ‘during the cur-
rent outdoor‘ matches‘. ‘

Voting Machines
For The Future

FIVE DAYS HAVE passed since last Friday’s
elections, and there’s still speculation and dis-
cussion on the relative worth of voting by ma-
chine. ‘ '

Most of us stand by the written ballot method.
Though old-fashioned, followers of the written
system prefer to depend on, and have more con-
ﬁdence in the old method. It’s just a bit too soon
to expect the mass of voters to substitute a new,
more-mechanical system for one which has been
in effect for many generations. It just “ain't
human.”

It took a long time for the forerunners of our
modern automobile, the “gas buggy,” to take the
place of the horse and buggy. However, people
gradually built up conﬁdence and today we see.
the horse and buggy abandoned completely.

Similiarly it is with election “machines.” Some
day the written ballot will be pushed completely
into the background and accurate, speedy ma-
chines both for vote-casting and vote-counting
will take their place.

University elections are ﬁne laboratories for
educating and instructing the voter in the ma-
chine method. It was a “noble” experiment that
introduced the newer method of voting to cam-
pus elections.

THE Pt'I"I

A ' R ' T "ll '
wait eactions o - I 5
By IRVING BENNETT

This week 326 students fifoin 31 Pennsyl-
vania colleges and lll1l\’el‘Sll1lCS are awaiting
the reaction to 1'€pOl’l;S of the “legislation”
they passed during the three day liitei'collegi-
ate Conference on Goveriiiiicnt in Hari'isbui‘g,
April 9-10-ll.

At the assemblage of college students for the fourth
conference since Miss Genevieve Blatt, graduate assist-
airt in political science, and John Bracken, "34, started
the program, 95 bills were passed. At the beginiiiiig: of
the committee sessions, the Harrisbiirg Conference had
220 bills listed on its agenda.

The 95 bills which passed the pleiiary sessions repre-
sented the work of ten committees, including, educa-
'l:l0ll, finance, local government, state governnieiit, collec-
tive bargaiiiiiig, labor, natural resources, public utilities,
public assistance, and social insurance.

Among the more widely-discussed measures adopted
by the coiiference, were several arising from the collec-
tive bargainiiig committee. One bill that passed out-
lawed company unions, while another forced the nicer-
poration of labor unions. Under bargaining, a bill pro-
viding for boards for mediation successfully passed the
conference. Under the labor committee, the “House”
favorably voted on bills whichwoiild forbid the sale of
poison gases and arms to industrial companies. The
'ti'anspo1'tatioii of strike-breakers was also made a pun-
ishable offense. . _

Bills which would change the local and state adminis-
trative systems were considered. A plan for a couiil.v-
manager system passed, while bills relating to the judi-
ciary also came up for approval. Under a series of bills
advanced by the natural resources committee, extensive
plans to combat waste were stated.

Reforestation of timber land was made compulsory.
State cooperation with the national government in ﬂood
control was favoredin a bill providing for a commission.
A_nother bill by this committee concerned the use of
hydroelectric power which might be derived from dam
projects.

According to the bill, liydroelectric power gains from
such projects would be distributed, probably at whole-
sale rates to companies, which would retail the power.
Electric utilities as well as gas and water utilities were
to be well-regulated through several measures brought
up by the utilities committee.

This committee asked for the zibolislinieirt of the
Public Service Commission and the establishment of a
Public Utilities Commissioii of nine members, three ex-
perts from gas, water, and electric ﬁelds. These would
investigate for fair rates and returns, and revoke per-
l‘l1l'l.S where they saw fit.

According to measures submitted by the coiiimittee
on education, Pennsylvai1ia’s school board system would
be revamped. A changing of the age when children may
quit school for work to 18 years of age was recom-
mended. Married womlcn teachers were to be forbidden
to teach school. A system of junior colleges was also
advocated for the state.

I-#33: Bill Berg And Bob Baugiliman-————
Up and Comin' '

There is a right smart organization brewing on our
campus which has been stai'ted by about seven girls
who are quite cliarniiiig and popular. They call them-
selves the Girtie Girls, headed by Ann Boyd, Patsy
Griffith, Mercedes Shiriiig, Mary McCahill, Jane
Epping, and Kay Simon. . . .

Too Bad

Very recently Miss Ly:-la Baltz returned that lovely"
Frat pin to Bob Aschomb . . . Ray Richinan and
Estelle Kovacs also parted recently . . . whether it
will be permanent or not is hard to ﬁgure out . . .

Comment _ V
George Potts has ﬁnally hung his fraternity pin on his
steady heart throb, Mary Francis Arnold . . . John

Cheffey and Bee Abiss did a little high class muggin
in the last row of Psychology class last Mon. inori1-
ning . . . good idea to have a little fun on a rainy
day without getting your feet wet . . . we wonder
who the lovely little miss Paul Koliberger was with
at ‘the bike race last week, sitting in a box, "mind
you, having ﬂowers tossed into her lap by Torchy
Peden . . . Pitt girls again fail to make a first down
as handsome Eddie McCann goes to Tech for all his
many dates . . . He does right well over there in the
company of pretty Jerry Dunn of the Fairfax Apts.,
and a little southern ‘gal from Kemp’s hometown,
namely Jean Ware . . . too bad girls . . .

Poison Ivy

What girl friend of a well-known campus biggie is turn-
ing the tables on him by going to the Ivy Ball at
Penn instead of that Pi Lamb spring formal .' . .
Condolences to the Owl staff . . . Bill Schenck is now
chasing another PCW miss in the person of Margy
Stewart . . . John Downie is doing puhlenty of stoo-
gin for a certain Margy Watson . . . why, we can't

‘see . . . she’s pulled a good deal of the same thing be-
fore . . . and we know . . . Ben Baskin was complete-
ly ﬂoored when a Win. Penn waiter asked him if he
was a Peabody High student in reply to his request
for a table . . . Between we’uns ‘the Senior Ball coin-
mittee could have done a little better on their dance
than they are doing . . . especially with -the good sea-
son we have had in regard to campus dances . . . we
lﬁear {the band will be Bob Clayman of the Roosevelt
ote . . . '

Politics

A great deal of surprise and perhaps disappointment
arose over the Sigma Chi’s recent election .
three year man was beaten out for President by a.
one semester man which is rather unusual to say the
least . . . This bunch is moving to Ellsworth Ave.
near Miss Ellis’ ‘school for future dcbutantes. . . .

A Good Out-Look

The child labor question rises to the front in the Co-

“The golf links lie so near the mill,
That on a bright spring day
The working children can look out
And see the men at play.”

Morgantown, W. Va., (ACP)—-—I‘liotograplis of end-
chewing mulch cows instead of those of 16 lovely coeds
competing for the title of Miss West Vi.rgini:i looked
up at readers of the Shaiiipain, liuiiiorous publication
of West Virgiiiia University.

Sizzling with anger at Editor Frank Neill’s picture
substitution, females held three hectic indignation meet-
ings within the 24-hour period after the magazine was
distributed.

The whole controversy hinged on the fact that in or-
der to cast a vote for the beauty queen, a choice of one
of the 16, a student would have to purchase a copy
of the Shainpain. » ,

Editor Neill ran the cow photographs because the
coeds and their dean, Ruth E. Noer, objected to the
publication of the

Senior President,
Barbara Thomas

Ba1‘ba.1'a Thomas, called Bobby by
those who know her well enough to
call her aiiytliiiig, is one of those per-
sons who has a inillion-dollar smile.
Maybe this is the reason she made
such a popular senior class president
this year-——o1‘ niaybc it's her natural
eﬂiciency.

At any rate, .T‘.i.i.ss Thomas got

plenty of experience in l1'l€etl1lg‘-p1'e-
siding-over during tier sophomore and
junior years in I-‘anhellenic. She
:-:ei‘ved on customs committee her
soplionioire year too; and switched

tee included her naine, too, as did the
executive-comniittee of PBI.
This year, besides being Senior
SFA
ineetings, worked as a loyal member
of l\_’lortar Board, served as a senior
iiientoi‘ and -again on the executive
committee of PBI. .

And still she ﬁnds time to spend
at the ZTA house, of which she is a
member, and to sell silverware to the
seniors. Which makes a full four
years.

©Cl1iefJustice,

Ruth Shapiro

When Ruth Shapiro comes to
school these days, it’s with a judicial
look on her face. She has to be
judicial—particularly with freshman
women. You see she’s chief justice
of Senior Court.

But to get back to earlier history.
Her sophomore year, Miss Shapiro
was a Cweii, sophomore advisor to
the literary unit, a member of Wom-
en’s Debating society, a Quill Club-
ber, and a member of WCEL. She
went Thespian, too, and joined Pitt
Players, Among the many meetings
she has to attend are those of Pi Tau
Phi.

In her junior year she cli_ai-rmaiined
the Organizations Committee of
WSGA, blue-pencilled and copy-read
on the editorial staff of the Journey-
man, went to SFA meetings as one
of its most stable members, and went
on debating.

This year, besides banging the
gavel as Chief Justice, she has served
as vice-president of Women’s Debat-
ing Association, a member of Delta
Sigma Rho, honorary debating soci-
ety, and called Mortar Board-mem-
bers “sisters.”’

'>WS6A President.

Lois Follansbee

When WSGA was called to order
this year, Lois Follansbee did the call-
ing-——-but this is getting alicnd of the
story.

Lois started out her frealiinaii year
by being secretary of the social unit.
During her sophomore year she was
president of Cweiis, soplioinorc wom-
en’s hono.rai'_v zictivities fi'alei'iiil:_v, :1
ineniber of the Cusloins Coiiiiiiittcc of
the WSGA, and cliairiiinii of her cl;is:5
social committee.

She didn’t let down her junior yeiir,
when she was seciretzwy of W SGA,
and a ineinber of SFA executive coin-
mittee.

This year she ﬁnished up llCl' four
years by being WSGA
working‘ as a Mortar Board-ile, a
member of Pi Laiiibda 'l‘heta--wliicli
is the l1oiioi':u-y cduontioii fi'alc.i‘nity

That’s the advice of Hal Mohr, ace

other day revealed to a startled col-
loge audience at the University of
Southern California, probably in
greater detail than has ever been done
before, the abracadabra by which
studios create fantasy and illusion.

Believe itoi" not, but:

The locusts you saw swarming over
the mountains in one scene of “The
Good Earth” were, in reality, soaked
coffee-grounds !

The bull which narrowly missed
goring Eddie Cantor to death in “The
Kid From Spain” .actually never
came anywhere near the comedian.

The airplane scene in “Kid Mil-
lions,” where Cantor apparently is
risking his life doing dare-dcvil

in his life.
The New York harbor in “May-
timc” was a miniature.

Revelations 1

Such were a few of the amazing
revelations made public for the ﬁrst
time by three of the motion picture
industry’s top Mei-lins, who not only
can pull rabbits out of a hat, but af-
terwardf. will make ’em do a song and
dance act. ‘

Probably one of the greatest tasks
ever faced by the hocus-pocus men
was that of trying to make actors out
of gi'asslioppei‘s for “The
Earth.”

“How to make the ’liop.pei*s motion
picture conscious was a big problem,”
declared Layton, in explaining the use

Will Help You Fool Public

By HARRY COULTER, U.S.C.

HOLLYWOOD, Calif.——Do you want to be a movie magician
———onc of those fellows who is paid a big salary to make a liar

If so, study chemistry and physics and brush up on the great

of the coffee-grounds. “We found it
impossible to make them swarm
through the air in a compact group
and in the direction we wanted them
to go, even when we were able to get
them off the ground. Finally, after
much experimentation, we hit upon
the device of boiling and saturating
coﬁ’ee—grounds, which we placed in a
tank full of water. When we took
the shot, which was a distant view,
the coﬁ"ee-grounds ﬂoating in the
glass tank gave a realistic effect of
locusts swarming in the sky!”

Tcmperamental Insects

Another difiiculty in dealing with
the temperamental insects was to get
them to descend en masse upon a
grain ﬁeld and destroy it.

A rezilistic-appearing hill was built.
Behind it was set a bouncing table.
The latter was made so that anything
placed upon it was immediately
hurled into the air. It had a bush

40 feet long in the form of a ll£‘.Xll)lC
shaft, which popped the ’hoppers over
the hill into a specially-built ﬁeld of
wheat. This ﬁeld was also ilccciving.
It was constructed on the order of a
roller-top desk, with six pounds of
iieedle-g1‘ass-attaclied to the sl.'i1.:.: of
the roller. As the roller was moved,
the “wheat” disappeared, and it
looked as though the hungry “locusts"
were doing a good job of eating.
Miniatures are coming into use
more than ever before. Often entire
cities and countrysides are built —
regular Lilliputs. The scenery in back
of the foreground is often built in per-
spective and gives a perfect optical
illusion, dwindling from full-size to
a few inches in height within 50 feet.

Miniature Make-Believe

The crumbling and burning build-
ings in “San Francisco” were minia-
tures, accordingto Layton, who says
they have ceased to be just models.
They must be absolute duplicates of
the originals, exact in every detail.

“Only God can make a tree, but
wait until So-and-So gets through
with it!”

This phrase, often heard ziinong
producers and directors, is their trib-
ute to the genius of the miniature-
builder, Layton declared.

And now——would you like to bu :i
movie magician? In the days of old
Salem, such goings-on would have
merited a burning at the stake.’ In
1937, they merit the burning of plenty
of money by studio executives who
eagerly seek the services of these
modern miracle-workers.

Says Hal Mohr, in looking to the
future of the motion picture indus-
try and its bag of tricks:

“We have to get new blood some-
where, and the college man with his
wider background, has the jump on
the rest of the ﬁeld. In this business,
you can't know too much!”
