Hart wins big

Senator Gary Hart of Colorado
pulled off an upset victory last night
over front—runner Walter Mondale in
the first of the nation‘s primaries in
new Hampshire.

Mondale said that he took “a cold
shower” in the primary, which Hart
won by an impressive 12 percent of the
vote.

A get-together by local organizers
for the Hart campaign on the ground
floor of the Williarrf Pitt Union
became a surprise victory celebration
as the New Hampshire results came
in.

“We did not expect this large mar-
gin of victory,” said Hart supporter
and Pitt student Lisa Messineo. “We
were hoping to stay close, to finish a
strong second. But this changes the
whole race.

“Mondale is no longer a shoo-in.
Now Hart is the candidate to beat.”

Chuck Pascal, a Democratic candi- 1

date for state committee anda Pitt
student said, “What happened was
that Mondale was taken by surprise
by the strength of the Hart organiza-
tion in New Hampshire. When you’re
the front—runner...there‘is a tendency
to let up.”

Pascal, however, said that Mondale

.will probably still get the Democratic

nomination because of a lack of
organization by Hart in some South-
ern states. Ten primaries and caucuses
are to be held on March 13, “Super

‘Tuesday,” including four in the

South.

“He [Hart] will do okay, but he
won’t do as well as he did tonight,”
Pascal predicted.

Candidate reps draw
scant student audience

By Catherine Save]
The Pitt News

Twenty students, out of a potential 3,-
4,000 student voters attended the candi-
dates’ for_um Monday night which included
four representatives of the eight potential
presidential Government Relations Com-
mittee, a standing committee of the Student
Government Board.

The representatives spoke on student
issues such asthe draft, federal student aid
and education. Larger issues discussed
included nuclear arms control and freezing,
employment and the economy.

Each representative touched on the spe-
cific proposed programs of his candidate’s
platform.

. John Glenn was represented by Mary

“Esther Van Shura, a Glenn running delegate

for the National Democratic Convention,
Gary Hart by John Whitehurst; Ernest Hol-
lings by Jim Coletta, a member ofthe Demo-
cratic State Committee and George
McGovern by Bill Wekselman. G. Toby
Gaines, who represented Rev. Jessie Jack-
son, appeared for comment after the forum.

Van Shura described the big spending
during the late ‘60s and ’70s as the “Visa
Card Mentality."

“You must realize the hard reality you are
facing. It is your generation that has to pay
for the illusion that big spending created,”
Van Shura said. _

Van Shura said that Glenn “offers some-
thing for the common person.” She cited
Glenn’s proposed congressional scholar-
ships in math amd science. These scholar-
ships_ would be awarded to high school
students in the form of grants for hours they

_ volunteered in community service work.

On foreign policy, Van Shurasaid Glerin

Money

wants a bilateral nuclear freeze as opposed

to unilateral. “Without a bilateral agreement .

you would have an element of distrust."

Whitehurst, representing Gary Hart,
called students “king.” T

“Students have made the Hart campaign
what it is today,” .Whitehurst said.

Hart sees education as a “total proccess."
His proposed educational programs include
an American Defense Education Act
(ADEA) and Individual Training Act(lTA).
Whitehurt said, “We need to excel in science,
math and computers.” Under the ADEA,
training in these areas would be stressed.
ITA would provide re-training for profes-
sionals such as unemployed accountants.

Hart also proposes a “l5—yearjobs" pro-
gram. lndividuals out of work would be
placedin jobs in maintenance and repair of
our roads and environment. “It would take 2
million people I5 years to do this,” White-
hurst explained.

“These jobs would give people dignity as
well as help repair the country,” Whitehurst
said. O

Hart plans to “freeze production of pluto-
nium,” Whitehurst said. This would make
an impact in the nuclear arms situation, he
explained, since the United States is a major
exporter of plutonium. “Plutonium -is a
major cause of nuclear pr-.i»iiferation,”
Whitehurst added. “Hart is i-:2 favor of
STOP (Strategic Talks On Prv ..~:ntion)."

Coletta attributed Hollings‘p.;5or showing
in the Iowa caucus to inadequate media cov-

' erage. “We did not get to the media we think

he (Hollings) deserves. TV and radio gave
other candiates more attention. The media‘
could actually manipulate the election,”
Coletta said. He also pointed out that “more
money and time were spent on_ the New

‘ Hampshire primary.”

Posvar asks state for increase

By John Gambescia
The Pitt News

Pitt chancellor Wesley Posvar was among
state university officials to testify before the
Pennsylvania House Appropriations Com-
mittee yesterday in an effort to receive more
state aid to run their schools.

Posvar asked the committee for an
increase of more than 16 percent in state
funding for the fiscal year l984-85. Posvar
said that the university woud be able to hold
tuition increases to 5 percent if lawmakers
grant the university’s request for a state
appropriation of $94 million.

Governor Thornburgh, in his budget to
the legislature, only recommended an
increase of around 7 percent in assistance for
state-related schools such as Pitt, Temple
and Lincoln University. Late last week,

year 1984-85. S

Jack Freeman said that Pitt's need for the
increase is due to the significant difference
between the 16 percent increase requested by
Pitt and Thornburgh’s 7 percent
recommendation.

Ronald Cowell, a member of the House
Appropriations Committee and a Pitt grad-
uate, told The Pitt News that no firm deci-
sions would be made at the meeting. “It is
simply an opportunity for Pitt to put it’s best
foot forward and convince the appropria-
tions committees to recommend at least the
7 percent increase proposed by Thorn-
burgh," Cowell said.

Alternative solutions urged

Arms control and disarmament
groups around the world have not
accomplished much because “open
dialogue and free agreement are not
the principles most of the world
operates under," according to writer

-Les Brunswick.

“Most things in the world operate
through competition and coercion,”
Brunswick said yesterday to the Pitt

4 Arms Race Study Group. He and

Fred Lancaster, editor of the Three
Rivers Network, spoke to the group
on behalf of the New Age move-
ment, which seeks to provide alter-
native solutions to a variety of
difficult global problems.

“In spite of the fact that [arms
reduction] is a very sensible goal, the
world’s leaders and much of the
world’s population just aren't going
along with it," Brunswick said. The
reason is that most political leaders
“have fought their way to the top
through competition" and have had
little experience with open dia-

logue, he said. ‘

"“They‘re not completely caught
up in this competition and coer-
cion," Brunswick added, however.
“[President] Reagan may be for

‘  This is going to sound a little wild,
but simply present to the people at
the top a more rewarding

New Age politics, also referred to
as the transformational movement,
calls for cooperation, open dialogue
and free agreement between individ-
uals, communities and nations,
Brunswick said. He explained, how-
ever, that the movement is alarmed
and “concerned with the form of our

made boundaries," he said.

Other goals cited by the speakers
included building an ecologically
sustainable society and “a much
more balanced society, which would
aim to meet all human needs, not
just the material ones.” They de-
scribed what they see as the need for
a less centralized, more community-
oriented way of life.

“Our society at present is
extremely wasteful. Our society con-
centrates on material production.
We’re in grave danger of having our
ecosystem disastrously affected,”
Brunswick said. .

A policy of using “appropriate
technology" would help solve this
problem, he explained, in which
high technology should be used only
in cases where low- and medium-
level technologies will not work.

The speakers said that all people
need a sense of community, digni-
fied and rewarding work, self-
respect and spiritual development as
well as material items.

“You’re not just a separate ego;
you're part of an interconnected sys-
tem that does have meaning,”
Brunswick said.

After the talk, Brunswick pre-
dicted that modern society will soon
reach a point of crisis.

“ Jewish center may close

J

Wes Cotter
The Pitt News

Oakland's Jewish Community
Center on Bellefield Street may soon
move to a new facility in Squirrel
Hill. The Jewish Center is currently
housed in a building that is in need
of expensive renovation. I

Oakland Directions lnc. (ODI). a

local community group, expressed
its concern over the center’s moving
Thursday night at ODl’s monthly
meeting. Members present at the
meeting said that the expense of ren-
ovating the center’s current home is
the reason for the planned move.
. According to Helen Schlenke, an
ODI member, many of the center’s
services have already moved to
Squirrel Hill. Schlenke said that
“The heavy Jewish population of
Oakland is not utilizing this facility.
I don’t want to see a Jewish getto
forming in Squirrel Hill."

Schlenke and other members of
the group expressed an acute inter-
est in keeping the center on Bayard
Street. ODVI would like the center to
continue in its present location with
renovations that would draw people
into the center such as a noontime
exercise program for businessmen.

The Jewish Community Center
has refused to comment on the move
at the present time.

In other news:

0 Construction has started in the
basement of the Sheetz convenience
store for the sandwich shop/bar
which will open there in the near
future. Plans for the new bar were
drawn up several months ago, and a
liquor license was obtained, against
the wishs of ODI, for the shop. The
shop will be able to serve only beer
and will operate like other shops in
the area that have similar licenses.

0 The Port Authority is being peti-
tioned by ODI to move the 6| Series
of buses back to Forbes Avenue
where they were originally located
before the first Parkway construc-
tion project. The Port Authority
said they will begin to think about a
possible trial for the move in
November of 1984 when the first
step of the Parkway project is
completed.

0 Surveys for extending the
sticker parking program in the Oak-
land area are being distributed. Cur-
rently, sticker parking is limited to
central Oakland. Areas such as West
Oakland and the territory south of
the Boulevard of the Allies are areas
in want of this program.

Other communities are also inter-
ested in the program, but the city
currently has one person working on
the program. According to ODI,
outlying areas wanting this service
will have quite a wait. I

The official student newspaper
of the University of Pittsburgh.
Editorial opinions are made by a
majority of the editorial board.
Opinions expressed in columns
are those ofthe author and not of
The Pitt News staff.

Published three times weekly
from September to May; weekly
from May to early August.

Last week, the Board of Directors at Amherst College in
Massachusetts announced that this would be the last semester

during which there would be fraternities or sororities at the
well-known school.‘ The college took these measures after

— ﬁnally being firm enough to buck the archaic institutions and

admit that for all the good things fraternities do, they introduce
a much more detrimental element to a modern academic
environment. .

This university would not be remiss if it, too, eliminated
these elitist institutions. The brothers and sisters of the Greek
system have been carrying on an incestuous relationship that is
by design discriminatory and sexist.

Cheating at the university was just one of the issues that
prompted Amherst to terminate its Greek system. It has long

, been suggested that fraternities keep files of old exams so that

their brothers would have an unfair advantage over the rest of
the student body.

Fraternities have developed along race lines with predomi-
nantly and exclusively white and black fraternities. This occur-
rence only further separates blacks and whites and strengthens
racist beliefs. '

Sexism, too, seems to be an integral part of the Greek system.
Women and men are segregated, and women are even further
denigrated by being admitted to fraternities as Little Sisters.

.The entire process of hazing and the personal humiliation
through which pledges are put to join a fraternity does not
build character but, rather, instillsfear and subservience in the
pledge. It also substantiates the notion of cognitive dissonance,
which holds that the more arduous the acquisition of a goal, the
more strongly people will convince themselves that they desire
that goal.

Fraternities are separatist and self-congratulatory; the few
benefits they claim as a basis for their continuation can easily
be achieved without them or their insults to the university.

Too Soon

Government and the news media have placed themselves
back-to-back, ready to take two steps, turn and fire over the
issue of network television's use of projected election results.

The House Telecommunication Subcommittee and its chair-
man, Representative Timothy Wirth, D-Colo., heard testi.mo-
ny earlier this week from executives from all three major
networks and cable news king Ted Turner. Wirth and his
committee are attempting to convince network news executives
that projecting winners in a democratic election before the
voting has finished tears at the very heart of democracy —— the
voters‘ perceived ability to make a difference. if

The news executives, with vocal and colorful dissent from
Turner, argued that any attempt by government at limiting the
free flow of information is a violation of the press’ freedoms
under the First Amendment. P ‘

As in many conflicts with the powers that be, the issue of
whether restrictions on early projections would indeed insure a
better election have been lost amidst idle threats and journalis-
tic dogma. Both sides need to establish that the role of the news
services is to inform the voter, not use the election as an
advertising windfall. ’

Cable News Networks Turner declared the issue a profit-
driven battle to attract election-night viewers. While the press
clearly cannot allow the government to become involved in the
business of determining what is news, it can not be allowed to
package that news in a high-tech sugar-coating of moving
graphics and buzzing logos without admitting its primary
motive — ratings. Ratings that convert into advertising

revenue. ~
To deny the effects early projections have on an undecided

voter is ludicrous. Just as ludicrous is news services‘ claim that
they are merely reporting an event for the viewers’ sake rather
than gl.itterizing another election race for the benefit of the
bank accounts. -

especially through those rose-
colored glasses you must be wearing.
Let’s take off those glasses and take
a clear look at what he has done for
us. . .
He has made many budget cuts.

’ For students, he has cut outlays for

guaranteed loans by 27 percent, and
he has cut funding for other student
aid programs by 13 percent. He has
also cut food stamps, child nutrition
programs, Medicare and other
health services.

I do agree with Mr. Cotter on
world peace. Mondale probably
won’t secure it. However, under the
Reagan administration, there is an
increasing number of of nuclear mis-
siles aimed at the Soviet Union. And
vice versa. This could hardly be
called a step towards world peace.

Cotter claims employment and
the budget deficit are two of Rea-
gan‘s last hurdles, but what has he
done so far? Jimmy Carter’s budget
deficit was about $60 billion a year.
Under Reagan, the deficit has
soared to nearly $200 billion a year.

For myselfand many other Amer-
icans, prosperity was in hand four
years ago. Today, it is only a dream.

I think most readers will see
through Wes Cotter’s propaganda
and help put an end to Reagan’s
longest running role. See you at the
polls.

City’s ties to
South Africa
irrelevant

In a recent editorial, you stated
that the City of Pittsburgh should
discontinue its relationship with the
law firm Baskin and Sears because
of its representation of South
Africa.

The City of Pittsburgh does not
employ Baskin and Sears because of
its ties with South Africa, they
employ it because it is a good law
firm and it can get the job done.
Likewise, Baskin and Sears does not
represent South Africa in its legal
affairs because of South Africa's
policies, but because it has a service
to provide and South Africa has a
need for that service. To use the logic
that the City of Pittsburgh’s employ-
ment of Baskin and Sears shows that
the city is patronizing apartheid is
the same as saying a lawyer repres-
enting a murderer is in favor of
murder.

Pitt should show real X-Rated films

Last weekend proved to be quite
busy and exciting for the usually
indifferent Pitt movie-going public.
The movies responsible for this fer-
vor were “Caligula,“ Bob Guggi-
one's overblown and pretentious
pseudo-epic, and “Not a Love
Story," a feminist documentary on
pornography.

Friday night, l0 minutes before
“Caligula“ even started, there were

. two ticket lines reaching almost to

the street. I went to see this film
because I am an ardent and dedi-
cated fan of cinematic decadence
and sleaze. I was told by others who
had seen the film before that it was
loaded with much in the way of grue-
some perversity, but the “Caligula”
that they described was the X-rated
version. Pitt, either for reasons of
morality, stupidity or both,
obtained the sanitized and censored
R-rated version.

I may never have knowifhow the
X-rated version measures up, but it
would be hard to conceive of a more

tedious and boring version of this
movie than the one I saw. My disap-
pointment at the lack of choice
scenes, though, was almost mit-
igated by the behavior of the movie
audience, which was as interesting as
it was funny. Judging by their initial

raucousness and the random shouts ,

of “F--- her!” and “Penetration!,"
“Caligula" had a certain special
attraction —— sex. Explicit sex, not
the wholesome TV sitcom variety.

At any rate, at least a third of the
audience departed long before the
film had ended. It was so funny
watching how the tedium and tame-
ness of the film chilled the crowd's
hot blood and caused them to leave
in droves.

“Not a Love Story", was another
movie indeed. Shown in the Pitt
Union movie room, this feminist-
made documentary on pornography
was a standing-room-only affair,
with hundreds more, including
myself, turned away. I had no idea
that there were so many feminist-

conscious students at Pitt.

. Like “Caligula,” the promise of
explicit sex was most likely the pre-
vailing attraction here. I would sur-
mise that unlike “Caligula,” which
attracted its throngs mainly by word

of mouth, “Not a Love Story“ got ..

the crowd it did due to a two-week
long campaign in this very paper,
warning of “graphic subject matter."
These half-page ads even included a
blurb from The New York Post that
read “ ‘Not a Love Story’ strips bare
the porn world.”

Those in charge ofacquiring Pitt's
films must realize, and realize imme-
diately, that these racy teasers are
cruel and unusual for the sensation-
starved movie-going Pitt student.
How heartless to toy with the the
pressing psychological needs of
these people by showing a censored
‘X’ movie and, because of careless
logistics, denying hundreds the
chance to see real movie hardcore.

All this and cordless

Some random notes from a pen
that has threatened to sue me for
non-use:

Olf any of you doubt that one per-
son can have much impact in the
world today, take the example of T.
Boone Pickens, who started in the
oil business in the mid l950s with a
single well in the desert. Today,

almost single-handedly, he has the
fifth—largest oil corporation in the
nation, and Gulf Oil is running
scared. By the middle of March, he
stands to win about 35 million share
of Gulf, effectively controlling the
corporation, which he will have
bought at an average of $603 share.

Analysts predict that Gulf can
avoid Pickens takeover only by

allowing itself to be bought by
another, friendlier oil company. If

Atlantic Richfield — ARCO —
which informally offered to buy
Gulf last month for $70 a share, is
the company that will save Gulf,
Pickens will still stand to make $350
million or so for his efforts. That
ain’t bad.

Olf I lived in McKeesport and
knew that the county health author-
ities knew a week before I knew that
my -water had too many parasites in
it, I know only one thing —— I would
be angryenough to want to force-
feed my water‘ to those authorities.

0Do any of you consider it ironic
that, in the same week, this univer-
sity managed to reject a $2 million

grant from the Heinz Foundation
and to announce a planned tuition
hike for the upcoming academic
year? Granted, comparing the two
events is a little like comparing
apples and oranges, but fruit,is fruit

Olf you think that you ‘re confused
by the proliferation of high-tech
gadgets on the market today, take
heart, for you are not alone. A friend
of mine, who works at a local Radio

stained jeans, Morgantown accent,

“Where's those cordless phones?"
The clerk leads him to the cordless

-phone display. The guy picks one up

and asks, “What‘s the range on this
here cordless phone?"

The clerk tells him, “About a 100
feet or so."

“Well damn, I don't have no use
for one of those goldarn contrap-
tions," he says. “I don’t.cven know
anyone within a hunnert feet of

Olf that didn’t make you laugh,
perhaps Cliff Stoudt did last Sunday
in his USFL debut. Or the histrionic

The only difference in the perfor-
mances of the two is that Stoudt was
doing an impression of a profes-
sional quarterback, not a whole

asty" fans, comes a report straight
from Dean Martin’s Celebrity Roast
that a new doll is about to enter the

will be named, aptly enough, the
“Cabbage Bitch Doll."

From the Foul Line/ Mark A. Sindler

Women’s Lib and Cindy Lauper, the new woman

, In the late '70s, wheneveranyone
brought up the issue of equality for
women, I enjoyed discussing it
about as much as Superman longed
to grab some kryptonite. Pros and
cons on the now-extinct Equal
Rights Amendment always flustered
me, so I kept my distance.

Now, my head is spinning faster
than a gyroscope. Cause for this
comes from seeing Cyndi Lauper’s
latest hit, “Girls Just Want To Have
Fun,” holding strong on Billboards
Top I0 charts. Granted, Cyndi may
sing the attention-getting song with
lyrics aimed at having strong sex
appeal, but it still doesn‘t cure a

ouiit-in headache that starts pound-
ing when I’m confronted with what
is proper etiquette around endearing
females.

Recently, I discussed my dilemma
with an attractive brunette while the
two of us lounged in a Shadyside
watering hole. Coincidentally, her

M name is Cindy. She just spells it dif-

ferently. I tried to spell out my prob-
lem to her.

“Ever since Hugh Hefner exposed
glossy centerfolds in the ’50s, Ameri-
cans thought it was OK to appre-
ciate certain women as works of art,
there to prove their worth in bed and
serve for domestic purposes during
the day. Then, 20 years later, people
started getting uptight about lack of
equal pay for equal time and women

being judged solely on tight jeans»

and revealing blouses. What is a
man to do?” '

“I think it was a situational kind
ofthing,” Cindy tried to explain, sip-
ping on tequila. “It depended on
whether you were a workingwoman
behind a desk in some corporate
high-rise or a cashier in a conven-
ience store or maybe working the
line for a phone company. Some‘
girls couldn’t care less. Others felt
they were getting cheated on the
paycheck."

“But when proponents of the
ERA are trying to portray women.
equal to men? Hey, what do you
think of a lady taking a man out on
the town? Just reverse the roles."

“Do that,” Cindy threatened,

X-Rated films

films semi-weekly. They could be
show_n in Lawrence Hall or better
yet, the fieldhouse. This isn’t such a
ridiculous idea. A large, eastern
Pennsylania university I once
attended shows X-rated movies
twice a month. They were always
lively affairs, quite popular with the
student body. Plus, they brought in
big money for the student
government.

If the absence of these films is a
result of ignorance or neglect on the

part of the Pitt film procurors, then
you, the Pitt movie-going public,
owe it to yourselves and others to
alert them‘ to the need for porno-
graphy on campus. If, on the other
hand, the lack of these really popu-
lar films stems from puritanical for-
ces within the administration of the
Pitt Program Council or the admin-
istration proper, then you still are
encouraged to voice your concern
through the proper channels. The
psychological well-being’ ofan entire
university may be at stake.

Druse  

Israeli

leader predicts

end to bitter Lebanon conﬂict

By Michael Pay
The Pitt News

The “anarchy and chaos” that has
long characterized the Lebanese
conflict will end within the next six
months if religious forces unite
against the Lebanese government
and Syrian invaders, according to a
leader of Israel's Druse community.

Zeidan Atashi, chairman of the
Task Force on the Lebanese Druse
of the Israeli Druse National Coun-
cil, yesterday told members of the
World Affairs Council of Pittsburgh
that the conflict is more social than
religious in nature.

Christians, Druse and Moslems
have coexisted for 150 years in
Lebanon, he said, and because of
this, they share common interests
which will eventually unite them in

the struggle for land and civil rights”

which have been poorly distributed
under the current Gemayel
government.

Zeidan Atashi

 

The dignity that comes with land
ownership is a very important part
of the Druse religion, Atashi said,
and they won't hesitate to fight for it.

Israel, he said, originally sup-
ported President Gemayel because it
believed his government would be
Christian, stable and democratic.
Instead, the Gemayel regime has
proved to be very weak and unpopu-
lar, favoring the Phalange religion
while ignoring the Moslems, Druse
and other Christians, he said. At this
point, he said, Israel would be
pleased if any stable non-Syrian
government would appear.

Atashi added that the United
States could play a very important
role in mediating an end to the con-
flict, if it were not so supportive of
the Gemayel regime. The decision to
align with Gemayel strongly resem-
bles other U.S. foreign policy deci-
sions which ended in disaster, he
said.

Hollings is in favor of a citizen
soldiery as opposed to a mercenary
military, Coletta explained. At a
recent university rally, Hollings
stated “I want to draft each and
every one of you for the good of the
country." Coletta explained that a
draft would pull the ed ucated as well
as those out of work or just out of
high school. Such an enlightened
“citizen soldiery concept would keep
America strong," Coletta said.

Hollings' educational programs
would “influence educationiin the
country to compete with Japanese
aynd German technology.” One way
to exceed Japanese education is by
turning high school teachers into
“professionals.” Hollings wants to
do this under his proposed Program

_ of Professional Teacher. Under this
program teachers would work l2
months instead of the current nine.
They would spend the summer
months “revising curricula and
spending time on self-improve-
ment,” Coletta explained. “Teachers
would receive a $5,000 subsidy
towards their salaries. For some
teachers that‘s- a 50 percent
increase.”

Gaines, representing Rev. Jesse
Jackson, said that the Southern
Baptist minister was “radically pro-
education."

“Everyone should have a guaran-
teed right to education," Gaines
said. Students. he added, are impor-
tant to the Jackson campaign
because they have “a greater degree
of awareness and honesty."

Jackson contends that the mil-
itary is “for defense purposes and

non-specific police actions.” Gaines
cited Beirut and the Honduras as
examples of such maneuvers.
Jackson supporters consist, for
the most part, of minorities, women
and labor, but not unions, said
Gaines. Since the recession and its
vast layoffs, this previous middle
class has found itself in a lower eco-

nomic level. “Now they are looking
at things from another side," said
Gaines. “Jackson is the man they
feel can represent them.”

Gaines stressed the importance of
voting in the Pennsylvania primary.
The ballots are divided into two sec-
tions. The top section is for the can-
didates themselves, and the bottom
section lists the delegates beside the
candidates to whom they are
committed.

“Vote for the delegate in addition
to the candidate. If the delegates do
not get elected there is no reason for

Vandalism costs Pitt plenty

By Patti Sechan
The Pitt News

A message such as “Call Sue for a A

good time” scrawled across a rest-
room wall can be a very costly way
for Pitt students to exchange gossip.

According to a recent article pub-

Ilished in U. S. News & World

Report, the vandalism bill for
schools in America was $600 million
in 1983. The University of Pitts-
burgh and its students have paid a
portion of that bill.

Between August and October of
last year alone, two acts of vandal-
ism cost Pitt and its students $7,000.

The first incident occurred in
August, 1983 when vandals dam-
aged windows in the newly com-
pleted Graduate School of Business
building, Mervis Hall, at a replace-
ment cost of $2,500. The second inci-
dent involved destruction to
windows of the atrium in the refur-
bished William Pitt Union. Dam-
ages amounted to $4,500 and the
guilty students were forced to make
restitution.

Pitt's assistant director of public
safety, Jim Waters said, “Vandalism
generally runs second only to theft
as our most commonly reported
crime." Over 200 cases of vandalism
are reported annually, Waters
noted.

Waters added that due to the
nature of the crime, only about I0
percent of the vandals are ever iden-
tified. “Those who are identiﬁed end
up paying the bill," said Waters.

‘A survey...determined that the major_ity_of
the vandalism is the direct result of alcohol

consumed by students.’

-James Beavers

In the dormitories, however, the
task of identifying vandals is a little
easier. Since the institution in 1979
of dorm contracts, students have
complete responsibility for any and
all damages to their rooms.

James Beavers, the business man-
ager for Pitt's Office of Housing and
Food Services, reported that stu-
dents paid $30,000 last year in
assessed damage fees.

Unfortunately, for vandalism in
common areas, such as stairweils,
restrooms, hallways and lounges,
perpetrators aren’t as easily identi-
fied. “Vandalism in these areas
hasn't decreased and cost the univer-
sity about $40,000last year. This

translates into an additional $30 a

year per student in higher room
costs," Beavers said.

In the dorms, according to Beav-
ers, the most recurring acts of van-
dalism involve destruction of light
fixtures, “trashing" the hallways,
and writing on walls. "Depending on
what type of paint or pen is used to
write on walls, removal can be very
time-consuming and costly."

What accounts for this type of
vandalism?

“A survey of the National Associ-
ation of College and University Ser-
vices determined that the majority of
vandalism is the direct result of the
alcohol consumed by students. So, if

Medium Soft Drink for only

$1.88 plus tax
good thru 3/6/84

you solve the alcohol problem, you
can solve a great majority ofthe van-
dalism problem,” Beavers said.

On the hand, William Acker, the
assistant director of Pitt‘s Physical
Plant, said he is pleased with the
“responsible behavior" displayed by
Pitt students, staff and faculty.
“They are to be commended. In
comparison to other urban universi-
ties, Pitt’s vandalism problems are
minimal," he said.

Acker cited writing on walls as the
single most costly, nagging and
annoying problem.

In his opinion, vandalism on cam-
pus should not necessarily be
blamed on university-related per-
sons. “People outside of the univer-
sity community do not have as
vested an interest in the condition of

our buildings and therefore do not‘

seem to behave as responsibly,"
Acker said. I

“The operating budget for the
Physical Plant is about S I0 million a
year and only about $10,000 was
spent last year due to vandalism.
This represents less than one-tenth
of I percent of our total budget,""'he
said.

Acker said he favors educating
students and faculty about the cost
and damage done by smoking, eat-
ing and drinking in classroom.

.Ridesharing bypasses commuter problems

By Kathy Casey
‘The Pitt News

Pitt students are finding their
worst traffic nightmares could come
true due to Parkway construction,
but two Pitt services are looking to
ease the problem.

Ridesharing, an affiliate of the
University Health Center, sponsors
carpools and vanpools for interested

Q commuters in the Oakland area.

Program coordinator Paul Grine
said he expects an increase in the use
of the service as traffic problems
mount due to construction.

The Parkway East reconstruction
this summer will cause a flood of
traffic on Forbes and Fifth Avenues,
the main detour routes for Parkway
travelers. Other work such as the
closing, of the Baum Boulevard
bridge and restrictions on Bigelow
Boulevard will create more snarled
traffic and commuter headaches for
the rest of this year.

“We do expect, with the traffic
congestion, to be able to help a lot of

O Oakland employees

out,” said
Grine.

Ridesharing’s computerized sys-
tem works by matching applicants’
home addresses, work hours and
locations. Riders share expenses and
driving duties, cutting down on
travel costs and hassles.

The service provides two types‘ of
carpools. Participants in “Shared
Driving Carpools" alternate driving

Ridesharing is available to all
Oakland students and employees.

Grine said the program is popular
and works well. The terminal now
contains over 6,000 names, but he
said the awkward hours of many
hospital workers pose difficulty in
matching riders.

Student carpools at Pitt are
organized by the Commuter Associ-
ation (CA). Students interested in
starting a carpool fill out applica-
tions that are matched by computer
with other students who live nearby.
The students are responsible for
contacting one another, according
to CA president David Leff.

Leff said the association has no
specific plans to promote the pro-
gram during construction, chiefly
because of staff shortages. .

“Even if we had the staff, there is
not much more we can do," he said.
The association is planning ahead
for the fall term but is not very active
now.

“It would be kind oftough to start

Pitt is looking into other ways to
ease traffic problems caused by
construction.

A new transportation task force
has been formed and is working with
PennDOT on efforts to ease traffic
problems around the university.
Some other options under consider-
ation are permitting ﬂexible work
hours, encouraging increased use of
carpools and vanpools, requesting
increased bus service and changing
class schedules. No decisions on spe-
cific action have been made.

Jay Roling, assistant vice-
chancellor of public affairs, said Pitt
is planning for the long-term.

July will be the first indication of

O how construction will affect the uni-

versity, Roling explained. He said
Pitt is preparing for 1985 projects as
well asthose underway this year. ‘

“We’ll take a long look at things
and urge employees in the area to be
cooperative," he said. Roling said
small committees are being formed
to analyze the impact of schedule
changes, but no changes are planned
for the immediate future.

Coalition set against State Stores

Ten major statewide organizations, representing 1.5 million
employees, announced the formation ofthe Coalition for Store
Divestiture. Coalition leaders said they will work to “mobilize

‘grassroots citizen support” for passage of Gov. Thornburgh’s
proposal to end the 50-year-old state liquor and wine.

“The state liquor and wine monopoly has proven itself to be
inefficient, unresponsive to consumers and even corrupt,” said
John Kulik, a spokesman for the coalition. “It has delivered
poor service, high prices and counterproductive pricing poli-
cies, inadequate selection and inconvenient hours. As represen-
tatives of many industries that service people, we are all too
familiar with the responses of constant consumer complaints
that have been voiced about the LCB for years."

The coalition is planning and implementing a grassroots

ram Council and the Funny Bone

By G. Warren Mayers
The Pitt News

Why would high school students
from a predominantly upper
middle-class community listen to the
political views of two African
students?

On February.8, Pitt graduate stu-
dents Matthew Ajibero, a Nigerian,
and N. Hillman Ngunangwa, a Tan-
zanian, spoke before a group of stu-
dents at Chartiers Valley High
School in Carnegie on the topic
“American Foreign Policy in the
Third World."

Ajibero, who recently received his
doctoral degree in Library and
Information Science, and _ Ngu-
nangwa, a doctoral student in Edu-
cational Administration, were
invited to speak by David Seal, a
junior at the high school.

Seal said the idea for sponsoring
the event grew out of a conversation
at his‘ home over the Christmas holi-
day, where Ajibero and Ngunangwa
were guests. Encouragement came
from his mother, Arlene Seal, of
Pitt's Graduate and Professional
Student Organization.

This type of ‘cross-cultural com-
munication is “important to the stu-
dents because they’re to be the future
leaders of this country,” Ajibero

said. “It gives them an understand- "

ing about African countries and
could help them to ‘understand the
individual without the perceived ste-
reotypes,” he added.

Hillman Ngunangwa and David
Seal both agree with Ajibero‘s
reasoning.

“Tanzanians in the United States
feel well-received by the American
people. People who have been to
Tanzania as tourists, workers and
students can tell of the love they
received there,“ said Ngunangwa.
He said that there is a need to further
this relationship at the personal
level.

“The students who showed up for
the presentation were all part of the
advanced placement program. They
were given an opportunity to listen

and compare other ideas on Ameri-
- can and Soviet foreign policies in the
Third World," said Seal.-

“Many students do not know that
much about Africa. Courses in Afri-
can studies were phased out [at
Chartiers Valley] about five years
ago,” Seal added.

Ajibero and Mrs. Seal were both
contributing members of a 21-
person international student task
force chaired by ‘Mr. Samuel D.
Deep of the office of the Provost
that convened last February.

The panel, made up of faculty and
alumni, was charged by Provost
Rhoten A. Smith to “review univer-
sity policies and procedures regard-
ing international students and to
make whatever recommendations
that might minimize the problems
and enhance the advantages asso-
ciated with their enrollment.” ‘‘

The task force met several times
between March 21 and June 15,
1983, both as a body and in various
subcommittees. To compile relevant
data, ‘the panel considered three
_approaches to the collection of

information. First, it was considered
that “task "force members simply
examine their own collective experi-
ences and opinions for answers to
the questions." This recommenda-
tion was rejected as “useless.”

Secondly, the panel considered
gathering information from relevant
university offices through interviews
and other techniques.

Thirdly, the panelists considered
holding hearings to “intensify its
data collection effort”and to involve
outside consultants in the study.
This last recommendation was also
rejected, and the panel chose to
employ the second approach.

With its work completed, the task
force compiled and submitted a for-
mal result of its findings to the uni-
versity in October, 1983.

Several recommendations were
rendered, covering almost all
aspects of student life from housing,
advising, counseling, financial aid,
health insurance and student activi-
ties to concerns about international
student interaction with American

Computer catches criminals

A new computer system will be used to catch eople who
failed to pay City Court fines for minor criminal o fenses such
as disorderly conduct, city officials said yesterday. They said
that beginning in March, the system will begin displaying arrest

 warrants for about 1,500 people who have yet to pay their
 fines. The computer will automatically issue warning letters to
those people and tell them of possible further court action.

Authorities said that in I983 the city magistrates levied about
$300,000 fines, but only one-third of that money was actually
collected. The computer will also print out arrest warrants for
people failing to pay their fines.

Consent sought in mastectomies

According to state lawmakers, physicians should have writ-
ten consent from women before performing mastectomies.
House Democratic Policy Chairman David Wright said that he
is introducing a bill that would require consent before a beast is
removed. Wright said that women are still awakening from
surgery to find a breast or breasts removed without their
consent.

The bill would also require that women with breast cancer be
informed of alternatives to radical mastectomy, which includes
removal of the entire breast, plus underlying muscle and lymph
nodes.

" Failing freshman saved

By Bernadette Hartman
The Pitt News

The Academic Intervention Pro-
gram, a program designed to help
freshman and transfer students
whose grades fall below a 2.0 QPA
after their first term at Pitt, helps
students improve their study skills.

Mary Schmidt, assistant to the
director of advising, said that the
program was designed to “catch a
student before patterns develop.”
Schmidt was referring to poor study
patterns that may lead to a students
being put on academic probation at
the end of his first term.

A student who enrolls in the Aca-
demic Intervention Program will
meet with a counselor on a one-to-
one basis to discuss his academic
problems.

Work began on the program at
the end of the 1983 Fall Term. Joint
letters were sent out by both the
Advising Center and the Learning
Skills Center, informing the student
that the Academic lntervention Pro-
gram provides an opportunity to
“remove roadblocks to achieve aca-
demic success."

Georgine Materniak of the coun-
seling center said that the program,
which was begun on Feb. 6, I984,
has attracted approximately 60 stu-

¢ dents out of the estimated 400 who

  African graduate students
S speak to area teenagers

were sent letters. She also added that
the reason may be that some stu-
dents who do fall below the 2.0 aver-
age after the first term think they will
be able to make it up in another
term.

contmueajrom page ten
students and the community. It was
these last two items that brought
Matthew Ajibero and Hillman Ngu-

nangwa face-to-face with students at
Chartiers Valley High School.

Ajibero told the students at
Chartiers Valley that the U.S. mass
media has produced a distorted view
of the socio-political events that
occur in Third World countries.

“Many Americans believe that
Africans live in trees and are canni-

Q‘ bals and that they support Commu-

nism. This charge comes from any
dramatic or political changes in
those countries. Africans who fight
for freedom of independence are
labeled terrorists by the Western
press," Ajibero said.

Ajibero said that people should be
given the facts to enable them to
evaluate these issues for themselves
and that the real issue in most Third
World countries is not the perceived
fear of communism but how to over-
come poverty.

“We have hundreds of thousands
of people scrambling for a few
meager resources,” Ajibero said.
“Any mission to Africa from the
United States should concentrate its
efforts on helping to overcome pov-
erty and not in fighting the so-called
communists."

Ajibero further charges that
American foreign policy under the
Reagan administration has been
counterproductive to the nations’
foreign interests and has driven
Third World countries into the

tﬁoviet camp.

“Nigeria is a nonaligned free
nation with close ties to the Western
world, particularly the U.S. Nigeria
needs American technology to
develop agricultural industries,"
said Ajibero. He praised the efforts
of the Carter Administration,
former ambassador to the United
Nations, Andrew Young, the Ameri-
can Chamber of Commerce and the
United Nations Children’s Fund
(U NICE F) for contributing to closer
relations between the two nations.

9!} Hillman Ngunangwa, who also
addressed the high school students,
made similar charges against Ameri-
can foreign policy in the Indian
Ocean.

“The security of Tanzania is inex-
orably linked to the security of the
Indian. _0.9c_a.n»" Ngglnaeswa said-

Another reason Materniak gave
for such low participation in the
Academic Intervention Program
was that after experiencing aca-
demic success in high school, “stu-
dents ‘may sometimes feel
embarrassed” having to ask for help
now.

However, those students who
have taken advantage of the center
have had their fears put to rest.

Students who nave approached
the center over its 10-year history
have acheived grade points that
average between 2.5 and 3.2., Mater-

niak said.

Rosalind 0. Jones, a learning
counselor, said that the six-week
program involvestaking a student
and directing himthrough the differ-
ent skill-improvement areas of the
Learning Skills Center. These areas
include aspects of study, reading and
mathematic skills.

Maternaik said that future pro-
grams for the Learning Skills Center
will involve “more of an effort to
alert probation students as well as
students who are doing OK but feel
that they could be doing better to the
services offered by the Learning
Skills Center.”

The center is presently looking for
counselors. In order to qualify, you
must have an above-average, stable
QPA, good communication and
organization skills and enjoy work-
ing with peers. For more informa-
tion about becoming a counselor,
contact Marcia A. Wratcher, study
skills specialist, Learning Skills Cen-
ter, x5481.

“Tanzanians feel threatened by the
military actions of both the U.S. and
the Russians in that area,"‘he added.

Ngunangwa also said his country
looks to the U.S. to correct the sys-
tem of apartheid in South Africa
and to help engineer the withdrawl
of South African troops from
Namibia.

“South Africa is the only country
on earth that has legalized racial dis-
crimination. The U.S. can use its
influence, through its massive
investments in South Africa, to pres-
sure that regime to change its poli-
cies," Ngunangwa said.

He also charged that the U.S.
links the withdrawl of Cuban troops
from Angola to its policy toward
South Africa and that country’s
occupation of Namibia.

“South Africa continues its occu-
pation of Namibia in defiance of a
U.N. resolution condemning such
action,” Ngunangwa said.

How did the high school audience
respond to these ideas?

“The response was somewhat
apprehensive, or more correctly,
passive," said Seal, the llth grader
who invited the speakers. Seal
attributed the overall response to a
lack of knowledge about Africa and
to the absence ofcourses on this sub-
ject. However. Seal is no newcomer
to politics.

Seal, who is captain of the
school's soccer team, initiated a peti-
tion to get a course in Russian stu-
dies included in the curriculum. The
petition, containing 29 signatures of
students in the advanced placement
program, has been accepted by the
Chartiers Valley School Board on
the recommendation of school
superintendent Dr. Philip Boggio.

Ajibero, Ngunangwa and Arlene
Seal all support the creation of a
permanent international student
advisory board, which Ajibero said
will facilitate understanding
between Pittsburgh communities
and foreign countries.

“Pittsburgh communities are bet-
ter informed about other countries
as a result oftheir contact with inter-
national students at Pitt. What is
still needed, in my view, is a closer
relationship between foreign and
American students. The setting up
of an international task force was a
welcome development." said
Ajibero.

Jud Hilliard, campus bus driver

Jud Hilliard has been driving the campus bus between Trees
Hall and the Cathedral of Learning for 12 years and has run into
his share of confused riders. -

“I get students who don't understand how the bus runs. They
think it’s a taxi service," he said.

Freshmen are another of HiIlia'rd’s problems. “They're ‘the
ones," he said, “who ask, ‘Where does the campus bus go?’ "

The blue and gold cruiser makes 19 stops on its route, which
includes the Cathedral, Trees Hall and the corner of Bellefield

’ and Centre.

Hilliard‘s bus gets especially crowded between 2:30 and 4
p.m., when many athletes are heading to practice. _
."I‘he big ones have their own cars, but theyride once in a while

‘like the rest of them,” he says.

But the roughest part of his day is the traffic. It can make stick-
ing to a 25-minute run just about impossible. PAT buses and the
hills of Oakland trouble him most.

John Roller, ’  
newsstand operator

John Roller works his way through
college at the newsstand on the
corner of Forbes and Atwood. He has
tremendous incentive to put in long
hours at the newsstand -- he owns it.

“There, that's just the way I like it,"
he says, standing back to admire a
display case he has just filled with
current issues of Muscle, Sports Illus-
trated, Time andother magazines.

The drab gray background of his
stand is masked behind a colorful
collage of newspapers and maga-
zines that ruffle in the wind as cars
and busses pass. The busy intersec-
tion boosts Roller‘s business, which
relies on pedestrian traffic.

Roller hopes to fund his math and
science studies at Pitt in the next two
years with his profits.

Bill Jones,
elevator dispatch

Life as an elevator dispatch is not
without its ups and downs. Bill Jones
can testify to that, as he has moni-
tored the Cathedral of Learning ele-
vators since 1958.

“I meet them all before they leave,"
Jones said of his patrons. “I’ve seen
all types. Some of them are grumpy
the whole day.”

Jones, who is 66, has tempered a
sure-fire weapon for alleviating
aggravation. “When they're grumpy,
I go to the bathroom. What are you
going to do?"

His responsibility is to make sure
the elevators function at all times.

"I know myjob, and that makes it
easy,” he said. “If I get a complaint, I
ride the elevator to see what the
problem is. But I don't like riding the
elevators."

Bob Finnegan,
litter collector

All of the hot dog containers, candy
wrappers and beer bottles that Pitt
students discard in the streets of Oak-
land eventually find their way into
the aluminum garbage can of Bob
Finnegan.

For the past four years, Finnegan
has been cleaning the Oakland side-
walks every day at 6 a.m. He works
for the People's Clean Up Oakland
project, according to the smock he
wears. '

His biggest nightmare is the end of.
each term, when he says students
like to litter the sidewalks with paper
and computer cards. He has a thank-
less job, but performs his duties
diligently. _ .

'‘‘I clean up, but by 1 1:30, it’sa mess
again. They’re pretty sneaky.”

Lois Spencer,
cafeteria worker

Lois Spencer is a surrogate mom
to Pitt students who frequent the
Towers Cafeteria.

“Certain ones come in every morn-
ing, and I know what they want. But
sometimes they switch on me. lf

, they don't show up, I wonder if

maybe they oversleptf’ she said.

Spencer's day begins at 5:30 a.m.,
when she prepares the eggsand grill
for the students who choose to fry
their own. .

An hour later she begins to set up
for lunch. Hamburgers need the
most condiments. she says. The rel-
ish, mayonnaise. mustard, ketchup
and onions must all be set up by 7
a.m.. when she finally takes her

i place on the breakfast line.

Despite working around the
renowned cafeteria food all day, she
claims. ‘‘I don't eat that much here."

Irene Mincin, metermaid

The neatly-uniformed woman stands before a Ford Escort to
scrawl a ticket much like a waitress stands before a customer to
take an order. One major difference: Irene Mincin’s claim check
can’t be sent back to the kitchen if the order is overdone.

Mincin, who is from the South Hills, has been working as a
metermaid for 18 years and presides over Oakland this week.
Metermaids are only assigned to Oakland one week at a time so
they can work all areas of the city. . '

She stops in the parking lot between Carnegie and Hillman
Libraries to note a broken meter in her book. In those cases,
when a crumbled sheet of notebook paper indicates some prob-
lem with the parking meter, she always gives the benefit of the
doubt _

Mincin claims to be busiest when patrolling the Oakland beat,
where a typical day brings between 50 and 100 tickets. Pitt
registration makesfor her busiest days of the year. V

Mincin does not drive. “l don’t trust the metermaids,” she says.

Panthers to throw everything at G’town

By Scott Dellett
The Pitt News



There is never an ideal time to
play Georgetown. It is even more
difficult to face Patrick Ewing and
Company around tournament time.

The Panther basketball team has
to partake of this unenviable task of
going against the Hoyas tonight at 8
p.m. in the Capital Centre.

Georgetown, ranked second in the
latest polls, is approaching its season
peak after a loss to St. John‘s last
Tuesday night. This was evident as

lege 83-70 last Saturday.

“The fact that we came off the
road with a victory is very impor-
tant, especially after losing to St.
John’s,” Georgetown head coach
John Thompson said. “There is a
level of disappointment every time
you lose a ball game.”

 Pitt can realize what Thompson is
saying, especially after Saturday’s
one-point loss at Syracuse.

“The kids are a little frustrated,’
Panther assistant coach Joe DeGre-
gorio said. “Its going to be yery
tough. Georgetown is a cut above
the rest."

Expecting to defeat Georgetown
before the upcoming tournaments is
comparable to seeing the president
balancing the budget —— it would

3, take a Herculian effort to come
close. Still, DeGregorio remains
optimistic.

“I know we beat Villanova and S .
Johns, and they beat Georgetown}
he said. -

The associative property may not .
apply here. The Hoyas are preparing
for another trip to the Final Four.
However, Thompson‘ refuses to look
that far ahead. Instead, the Hoya
mentor has his mind on preparing
for Pitt and Syracuse on Saturday.

3 ‘‘I’m not as concerned with post-
season bargaining position,"he said.
“I think we are in a good bargaining
position. '

“The next two games are impor-
tant within themselves. Anytime we
play a ballgame, we havent com-
pleted the season. We haverit been‘
playing games that much in View ofa
post—season tournament. _

“I think a lot of times that it can be
a distraction," Thompson said. .

The Panthers can be a real nui-
sance to the Hoyas by taking a page
out of the Georgetown style book —
play aggressive defense.

“We’ve got to be very physical

with‘ Georgetown," DeGregorio

, said. “We’ve got to , use multiple
defenses. Don‘t be surprised if you
see us change defenses.”

It should come as a shock if Pitt
tries to slow the tempo a bit.

“We should run a little bit,"
DeGregorio said. “But we‘ve got to
play smart basketball. Nobody likes

. to play defense. lfyou move the ball

i around, the longer you make them
play on defense the sooner the team . . _ 7 ~ _
is going to give up." 9 - - . ,

Panthers

By Bob Bordas
For me Pitt News

You would never know that
Panther baseball coach Bobby
Lewis stood a mere five victories
away from eclipsing Doc Carlson’s
all-time record of 367 victories. Such
is not the makeup of Bobby Lewis.
Instead, he deflects questions con-
cerning that subject and attempts to
downplay his inevitable move into
the record books.

“I don't think much of the
record," Lewis said, referring to the
achievement of Pitt’s biggest winner,
Hall of Fame basketball coach Dr.
Henry Clifford Carlson. “I would
just like to get it out of the way as
quickly as possible. I think it shows
perseverance .more than anything.
[Lewis has coached 30 years com-
pared to Carlson’s 31.] And
remember, I didn't win any of those
games. Players win games. Coaches
only lose them."

Modest guy that Bobby Lewis.
But he need not be where this year's
team is concerned. Once again, it
appears that Lewis, in the manner of
an architect, has constructed a solid
squad.

The Panthers return six of the top
nine hitters from last season’s 15-1 1

team. All six ofthose guys hit .300 or
better.

“Hitting will definitely be one of
our strengths," Lewis said. “We lost
a couple of good hitters in Joe Tis-
acher and Tony LaCava, but the
bulk of our hitters is back. Hitting
will be an asset.” .

Pitt does have the sticks, and the
junior class provides much of that
punch. First baseman Tom Horcw
led the group with a .412 average.
Westwood also paced the team in
RBIs with 25 and game-winning
RBIs with four. Other .300 hitters
include Fred Galle (.38l), Ken
DiBucci (.346) and Phil Palandro
(.325).

. Attention Skier

Frank Craska.

The Panthers’ fielding hasn’t
looked too shabby either.

“We've looked p'retty good so far
in the field,” Lewis said. “We will try
to get the best infield out there that is
possible, and a lot of that will
depend on who has the hot bat. I
won't hesitate interchanging our
players."

Two guys who figure to have a
tremendous impact on the team are
two Pitt football players, Chris Jelic
and Matt Stennett. Neither will hurt
the Panthers with his batgand their
foot speed will come in handy in the
outfield and on the basepaths.

“Both Chris and Matt are bona
fide baseball players,” Lewis said.

“They both run well, hit with power
and are good competitors. They're
good athletes, and we will use that to
our advantage.”

The pitching chores fall on the
strong right arms of junior Aaron
Krause and

and 3.11 ERA last season. Not bad.

-considering he was coming off

surgery. Whereas Krause is a control
pitcher who prefers to set batters up,
Craska possesses a live fastball and
complements it with a hard curve.
He used both pitches to record a 3-2
mark and 32 strikeouts last year.

sophomore Frank N
Craska. Krause posted a 4-3 mark

bacher. Cosgrove hurt his arm,
during last season's swing through
Florida and appeared in just one
game. Lewis said that the southpaw
has rehabilitated the arm and is
throwing without pain again.

One of the few disadvantages
Lewis can see is behind the plate.
Neither Darryl Bache, who played
only one game last season, nor
Rande Bitonte, a transfer student, is
long on experience.

“Catching could be a problem if

I we have any injuries.” said Lewis.

“We’re not real deep there, and we
could hardly afford an injury to
either of our catchers.”

Pitt will once again go south to
take advantage of the Florida sun-
shine from March 16-25. The Pan-
thers will meet perennial Top I0
choice Florida State three times and
Florida A&M twice.

Lewis is a proponent ofthe annual
trip.
“Their facilities down there are
very good, and it provides us with
valuable practice time," Lewis said.
“We also face good competition,
and that isn‘t bad either. I have also
found that our players rise to the
level of their competition.”

Strong competition. Bobby Lewis
wouldn’t have it any other way. If
you’re going to break a record, you
might as well beat the best.

Pitt’s Dabkowski braces
for difficult competition

By Wes Cotter
The Pitt News

Debbie I)abkowski had com-
peted in the Junior Olympic
national competitions three years in
a row. She was a high school senior
on her last trip to the competitions.
She was frustrated. In her first two
times at the meet. she was unable to
win a medal. Her mind was made up,
she was determined to bring a medal
home from her last trip to the
nationals.

She was doing well in the meet.
but. in the middle of the competi-
tion, she tore a ligament in her knee.
At the time. she didn’t realize the
pain in her knee would eventually
send her to the operating table and
keep her from competing fora whole
year. But she wanted a medal.

Before her injury. Da'bkowski‘s
strong events were the vault and the
floor exercise. Dabkowski .was
unable to earn a medal in the vault.
but where most people would have
dropped from the competition to
avoid further injury, she ignored the
pain and competed in the floor exer-

cise. When the judges posted the
scores, Dabkowski had earned her
medal.

Her dream was fulfilled, but she
had a torn interior cruciate to show
for it. She was scheduled to come to
Pitt in the fall and compete as a I.ady
Panther in the upcoming season.
The doctor had different plans for
her. and she was forced to undergo
surgery to correct the damage to her
ligaments.

The surgery went well, but l)ab—
kowski was redshirted for her fresh-
man season and was told there wasa
possibility that her gymnastics
career might end.

“I thought it was really going to
screw things up. But Donna [Sanft.
lady gymnastics coach] was nice.
and everyone was great. I came up
everyday and did rehab to be around
the team. I watched every day to see
what everybody was doing," Dab-
kowski said.

It took her a whole season to
return to par. but she was able to
overcome the surgery and return to
top form. I)abkowski said that she
thought she would never be able to
be doing the tricks she is today.

But the surgery has left her with a
permanent reminder of her injury.
In order to compete, which involves
doing flips andjumpsthat could eas-
ily throw her knee out ofjoint, Dab-
kowski must wear a knee brace.
Dabkowski wears the brace only
when competing so that her knee
cannot move from side to side or
hyperextend.

“Ifthe doctor told me today that I
didn’t have to wear it any more. I
probably would." Dabkowski said.
“I need it mentally.“

Babbie Flock. a senior. said. "The
knees are our biggest asset. Even
though she [Dabkowski] has had
this problem. she's come back. She‘s
not afraid to do the tough moves.
She treats her brace like a part other
body."

I-‘lock was redshirted with mono-
nucleosis during the same season as
I)abkowski. The two developed a
friendship while returning to full
strength. Flock said it‘s not easy to
return after a serious injury but
Dabkowski has done a goodjob and
her scores this year reflect that.

Dabkowski has had a good season
 posting high scores in the all-
around competition. [)abkowski
has shown much improvement this
year and commented that she is very
happy with her scores. particularly
on the uneven parallel bars.

“I never thought I could score 9‘s
on the bars. I have more confi-
dence." Dabkowski said. “We lifted
earlier this season. and I feel like I’m
in better shape than I have ever been
before.”

Frank Klein. the assistant gym-
nastics coach and uneven bars guru
for the Lady Panthers, said Dab-
kowski has come back largely
because of her attitude. “It‘s a hard
thing to do. Her rehabilitation exer-
cises had to be done every day. and
she did it. its discouraging to be
lame for a whole year.“

Klein went on to say that Dab-
kowski is back to full strength and
trying some moves that carry a lot of
skill points. Klein said she is work-
ing on doing a double back ﬂip.

Away from the gym. Dabkowski
studies business and coaches gym-
nastics during the summers. She said
she is unsure about her plans but
may someday return to her home-
town of Bristol. Conn.. where she
would coach at a gymnastics school
full time.

The Pitt News

Saturday’s game between Pitt
and Syracuse provided a
resounding example of how
major college basketball officiat-
 ing has failed to keep up with the
i A development of the sport.

A mid-air collision between
Pitt’s Clyde Vaughan and Syra-
cuse guard Dwayne “Pearl”
Washington, in which Vaughan
found himself being unceremon-
iously tackled to the ground,
proved to be just another exam-
ple of poor officiating in a game
and a season filled with
mediocrity.

Officiating basketball has
never been an easyjob. Now that
the sport has developed into a
.3 hybrid of its former self, the offi-

I ciating has gotten even more dif-
ficult. The players are better
atheletes today —- quicker, fas-
ter, .stronger —- and the game has
evolved into one which is less
dependent on strategy and more
on pure athletic skill.

Washington may have tackled

BASKET
WEAVING

Vaughan unintentionally, but it
was clearly a foul that placed
Vaughan in danger.

As Vaughan went to the line to
shoot a one-and-one, Panther
head coach Roy Chipman
screamed for a techincal foul
while Washington sat down on
the Carrier Dome playing sur-
face as if to offer his own com-
ment of the play. Washington
could have been resting, but
more likely he was having fun
with the fact that hejust got away
with a ﬂagrant foul.

The inability of officials to
take early and lasting control ofa
game allows for antics such as
the ones exhibited by the Pearl.

From a courtside vantage
point, the hits and misses by offi-
cials are glaringly evident. The
only defense of the officiating

.. A Vaughan, college basketball
are fouled out by officiating

these days is that it fails on all
sides and shows no prejudice.
But if the quality of rule enforce-
ment does not improve, the qual-
ity of the sport will inevitably
suffer. I
Basketball officials need to
recognize their weaknesses in
covering a sport that has become
almost impossible to watch in its
entirety without missing critical
plays. The talent of the contem-
porary athlete has transcended
attempts at better officiating. A
new philosophy of officiating is
needed, whether it be adding new
rules, or improving the curren
officiating. ‘ *

The long-term solution might -

call for radical changes in the

sport, such as going from a five

against five game to a four

against four. Play around the

basket has made officiating
block shots and player control
fouls a dart-throwing process.
The change from two to three
officials helped brieﬂy, but now
that the rule has had time to set-
tle, it seems clear that someone
— whether it be because of bad

' positioning or laziness — is miss-

ing the calls.

By Laurie Kubli
The Pitt News

A muddled field ofaspiring cham-
pions wil appear in Jamaica, N.Y.
for the Big East conference playoffs
in women's basketball this weekend.

Sorting out the seeding is fit for
the keenest harvesters of fate, but
predicting the eventual winner may
prove even trickier.

The confusion arises from a seem-
source: win—loss
records. Ah, but everyone knows
that numbers never lie. They can,
however, make life more difficult.
This particular set of numbers has
the seeding committee scratching
their collective heads, attempting to
decide who will play whom.

Of the nine teams, six post win-
ning records, one is 4-4, and the
other two, well, probably won‘t be
heard from after the tip-off Friday
night. _

Pitt (l5—l l) and Villanova (20-6)
lead the way with 6-2 league tallies;
the Lady Panthers received the No. l
spot with a win over the Wildcats in
the teams’ first inter-conference

meeting. Never mind that it was a
three-point win in overtime gained
from a basket dropped through by
Pitt‘s Julie Callan in the last second
of regulation time.

lt was a sign of things to come -

the beginning of the Lady Panthers’
habit of granting the opposition
breathing room in the first half, only
to deflate them in the second. Pitt
can not afford to be lazy at any time
should the two teams meet again.
Villanova has achieved its record on
the strength ofpre-season rookie-of-
the-year Shelley Pennefeather’s 2 l .8
ppg and the 20 points and nine
rebounds Nancy Bernhardt rounds
up. ,
Pitt held Pennefeather to eight
points in round one. If they can
repeat that feat, a win here is within
reach. However, the Lady Wildcats
do not posses the highest winning
percentage in the conference: St.
John's does.

Tournament host St John’s (2l-5)
one of four teams with 5-3 Big East
marks, presents a sizable obstacle
for Pittsburgh. The Express came to
Pittjust a few weeks ago, and will no
doubt be anxious to avenge the l9-
point humiliation heaped upon
them by the Lady Panthers. It was
St. John's 28.6 percent field goal
shooting in the second half that dis-
solved a strong offensive unit led by
Barbara Rapp (22 points) and
Jackie Smith (I0 points). Even with
a shooting percentage that should be
much higher, the Express has a shot
at the championship.

Theonly two teams to whom Pitt
has lost are both 5-3.

Seton Hall mimicked Pitt's tac-

  
  

tics, trailing by three at the half, then
performing a dramatic comeback in
the Lady Panthers’first interconfer-
ence loss, at Seton Hall. lt is unlikely
that the Lady Pirates can do it again
on a neutral site, despite the efforts
of Gloria Bradley and Leslie Fair-
banks, who contributed 13 points
and six iebounds, and l9 points, 7
boards, and seven assists,
respectively.

Syracuse defeated Pitt solely on
adrenalin.

Three Orangewomen played in
their final game at the Carrier
Dome, which has an intimidating
atmosphere for a visiting team to
play in at any time. Pitt shot a poor
33 percent from the field while Syra-
cuse dropped just about everything
through, shooting 59 percent.

The fourth middle-ground team
at 5-3 is Providence, also defeated by
the Lady Panthers. The Lady Friars
were on a roll before coming to Pitt
where they were turned away by the
host, 8!-75. It was another case of
the Lady Panthers‘ starting out slow

and making a comeback. Newcomer,

Doris Sable led the way with 22
points at Pitt — I0-I3 from the free
throw line and 6-l0 from the field.
Three other Lady Friars scored in
double digits, too. With the expe-
rience if three seniors, Providence
cannot be counted out of this race‘.

Here are a few things that l have
been thinking about while I should

0 Marcus Dupree, the ex-
Oklahoma, ex-Southern Mississippi
student, has reportedly signed with
the New Orleans Breakers of the
' United States Football League for
five years and $5 million. Not bad
for a college dropout.

The only problem that Dupree
and the Breakers have now is getting
the USFL to bend its rule that pro-
hibits the signing of underclassmen.

problem since the rule was stretched
once before for another running
- back. You remember him. His name
is Herschel Walker.

Sports thought instead
of book work for scribe

neer to just 54, yards passing. The
Maulers will find it hard to win,
though, without scoring more
points. .

I The other football team in Pitts-
burgh is in,the news, too. Steeler
quarterback Terry Bradshaw and
Coach Chuck Noll have been dis-
cussing Bradshaw’s future, and
Terry doesn’t like what he is hearing.

Noll said recently that the arm
injury that kept Bradshaw sidelined
for all but one—quarter of last season
may keep him off of the turf this
season.

Bradshaw’s arm —~ and his feel-
ings — may be hurt, but his mouth is
in perfect working order

“He [Noll] ought to just keep his
mouth shut and pay attention to the
draft and take care of business and
not make statements about me until
he‘s absolutely certain what he is
saying," Bradshaw declared.

Pretty harsh words said to the
man who decides who will and who
will not play football for the
Steelers.

0‘ The Pitt Panthers have been
playing their best basketball in
recent memory, winning three of
their last five games. Victims of the
Panthers‘ latest spree have been

Notre Dame at South Bend and Vill-

, anova and Seton Hall at the Fitz-

gerald Field House. The two losses
have been by a total of four points,
losing to the Redmen of St. John‘sin
New York by three points and drop-

ping a ‘heart-breaker to Syracuse by

one in the Carrier Dome.

The best hope for the Panthers
may be to get Patrick Ewing to go a
few rounds with Matt “Crusher”
Miklasevich and get him to watch
the rest of the game from the bench.

0 Spring training has_ started, and
the Pirates are in the news. Pitcher
John Candelaria has been refusing
to report to. the Pirate training
camp. It seems’ that since Kent
Tekulve signed for an estimated $1 ,
million a year, Candelaria believes
that at $700,000 he is being under-
paid and wants to renegotiate his
contract.

It is very difficult to sympathize
with Candelaria; $700,000 seems to
be a reasonable sum of money for"
pitching once every four days for six
months, especially for a pitcher with
chronic back problems and arm
surgery in the past.

0 Pass interference won't be much
of a penalty in college football any

. more. A new rule has made pass

interference a l5-yardpenalty and
automatic first down except when
the penalty occurs less than I5 yards
from the line of scrimmage, in which

. case the ball is placed at the spot of

the foul. . V
Coach Howard Schellenberger of

‘national champion University of‘

Miami doesn’t agree with the new

rule and said it would alter the way '

his defensive backs play the game.

who say athletes don't go to class.
Junior guard Arvester Campbell of
the Western New Mexico Mustangs
went to class. In fact, Campbell
almost went to class too often.
This week, National Association

cleared the way for Campbell and”
the Mustangs to compete in the Dis-
trict 7 basketball playoffs. They-
ruled that Campbell was allowed to.
play even though he took the same

DuPree turns pro

Former running back for the Oklahoma Sooners, Marcus
DuPree, has agreed to a 5 year—$5 million contract with the New
Orleans Breakers of the USFL. The owner of the Breakers, Joe
Cenizaro, is trying to obtain approval from the league to sign DuPree.
The problem in signing him is that it is against USFL rules to sign
underclassman.

By Charlie O'Hara
The Pitt News

Following a Fiesta Bowl bid season, Pitt
head football coach Foge Fazio has
removed many of the doubts and questions
that one year ago surrounded his abilities as
a mentor.

Fazio and his crew recently - pulled off
what many are calling one of the top five
recruiting efforts by any program in the
country. Hisfootball team was molded into
a solid unit during the 1983 season, earning a
x . Fiesta Bowl bid and a top 20 national
\ . F ranking.

' Pitt's offense proved it could run and pass
while the defense continued itsoutstanding
tradition of power and ﬁnesse.

Not bad results from a team whose head
coach was receiving enough ﬂack from
media and fans, a year ago. to consider an
admistrative position.

In an interview withThe Pitt News, Fazio
discussed the differences that the year has
made while addressing the other facets of the
head coaching position at Pitt.

It has been a year of development for the
Pitt football program. What do you point to
as reasons for the team’s successful
campaign? A

FAZIO: There were some moments of
doubt and some uncertainties following the
’82 season, but the ’83 season proved to be
rewarding in a lot of ways. Mostly because
we didn’t have the great expectations to live
up to. There was a lot of satisfaction in the
fact that we proved that we could play with
anybody in the country. We proved that we

could take young kids, players that hadn’t
played before, and by the season’s end, say
that they lived up to their slogan: “Count on

me in ‘83.“
Guys like Tony Recchia, a walk-on pun-
ter, quarterback John Congemi, who came

in the second game [for John Cummings],
Chris Jelic, who relieved [Congemi] in the ’

Notre Dame game and victory
so many guys tnat played a big, role in our
Fiesta Bowl team.

The team had a motto of never being
satisfied. ' '

Coaches deal with freshmen every year,
and the recruiting of high school players is a
year-round effort. How much can Foge
Fazio and his staff deal with the young play-
ers as individuals?

FAZIO: I think that the coach who re-
cruited him, the assistant coach who coaches
him when he gets here and the head coach all
play a part.

I've been in every one of their homes.
Those kids, when they visited here, came to
my house. They know me and my family.

In the last two or three years, I think one
thing that we’ve been able to do is deal on a

personal basis with each one of them. Very ’

few of the freshmen have left after their first
year. Very few have had any academic diffi-
culties, either.

Everyone of our freshmen is required to
come in once a week to talk to his position
coach. This is for five or 10 minutes. Not

pg only to talk about football progress but to

discuss what is going on in the classroom.
Our position coaches has academic files on
all of the freshmen. This way, the kid can
have confidence going to the position coach.

You got a bad rap from the media as a
rookie coach. Is it satisfying for you to look
at the same people who second-guessed you

and be able to say, “Hey, you guys were 

wrong about me.”?

FAZIO: I have never wallowed in
anyone’s misfortune. l‘ve never bragged
about my accomplishments. I learned a long
time ago that football is a game, and it's like
a game of life. There are gonna be days when
you have a great day and days when you‘re

. down.

Taking that into consideration, I have a
lot of compassion for people; everyone has
to do his job.

I’ve always felt that if] ever gave anyone
an impression that I wasn’t doing myjob or
if I gave them the impression that I was a
genius, then I‘m held accountable for that.

The one thing that I’ve always said is,
“Keep in mind that we wear blue and gold
uniforms, and we don’t wear the black and
gold ones [Pittsburgh Steelers].” My kids
are still college guys. Sometimes the pressure
that is put on them is because of the media
expectations. Some kids can handle it, but
some can’t. Ijust wish that they’d remember
that these still are 19-, 20- and 21-year-old
kids who want to have fun, too.

What they say about me, I'm held respon-
sible for. -

I How does Foge Fazio measure success as
a coach?

FAZIO: I think that to measure the suc-
cess depends on the expectations you have
entering a season. The challenge is to have
your guys prepared, week in and week out.
This past season was rewarding for us
because it was team that had to beimolded.
The expectations were not that high before
the season, but we knew that we had to stick
with it every week, knowing that many of the
kids were young and inexperienced.

We have redshirted a few freshmen, which

is hard because they don't get a chance to I

travel with the team.

 Panthers’ coach discusses
the Pitt football program

redshirted. He has a great attitude towards
Pitt. In the first semester, he got a 2.8 [QPA].
He was upset with that because his goal was
to achieve a 3.0 -— a kid like that who is
wor_king.out very diligently and can’t wait
until spring practice. He is just an example
of how much the program has progressed in
the past three years.

How demanding is being a father on top
of all the duties as head football coach?

FAZIO: The one thing —— the unfortunate I

thing — is that sometimes you do slight the
kids. The good thing about the situation
here is that we live three blocks from the
stadium, so my son and daughter[Vince, I3,
and Kris, 16] come to practice all the time.
They’re at every home and away game. The
time you spend with them isn't a lot, but it's a
meaningful time. They help a great deal by
justpgetting involved.

On Saturdays during December, January
and February, Chancellor [W‘sley] Posvar
meets with the prospective athle es and their
parents who are visiting on campus for
about I5 or 20 minutes in his office. If he’s
not there, then Jack Freeman [Provost] will
meet with them. i’

Other members of our administration and
faculty have done a goodjob for us. A lot of
the guys from the faculty and the deans have

helped us. They come in and talk to these»

kids on Saturdays on their own time.‘

We'll include some of our alumni. Alumni
are not allowed to recruit off campus. There
not allowed to see a boy face-to-face off
campus. So when they [the recruits] do come
onto campus, then we’ll have Joe Massaro
[Massaro Corporation], who is an engineer-
ing ‘graduate from Pitt and a ‘very successful
businessman in the Pittsburgh area, talk to’

them. Well have some of the Golden Panth-

ers [alumni fund raisers at Pitt] come in and

What are your feelings after a superb I

recruiting year?

FAZIO: Not too many coaches talk about
recruiting, but I‘don’t think that’s right. I
think any time you put the kind of time into
something, recruiting is a year-round thing.
You watch ‘em practice, and you go to their
games in the fall.

All of the sudden, they say they’re going to ‘

your school, and then you never talk about
them again. When local kids like Dante
Wiley or Mark Brasco say they want to stay
home, that says something. If nationally-
known recruits like Charlie Gladman or
Craig Heyward say they’re coming, well,
these kids could go almost anywhere in the
country.

I‘m proud; it says so much about the insti-
tution itself. These kids are looking at a lot

Who gets involved in the recruiting of

prospective high school players?

FAZIO: Number one, our players get
really involved. Mark Bailey, Mark McIn-
tyre, John Congemi —— our players host the
kids when they make their visits and then
follow up with phone calls.

Pitt willprobably be ranked among the
top 20 in the country. What does the team
have to concentrate on in order to make

steady improvement? V » -

FAZI0: The balance that we were able to
show, especially at the end of the season
when the passing game took hold, was cer-

tainly promising. We weren’t able to make

some of those big plays.

Defazio puts
Pittsburgh on

handball map

‘By Tim Dlnger
And Bob Green
The Pitt News

Pitt may be known for having a
nationally ranked football team and
a Big East contender on the basket-
ball courts, but Pitt senior Dave
Defazio is putting the Panther name
on the map in a different way.

Defazio toppled the first-seeded
player in the finals to become the

Class-B handball champion of~

Pennsylvania, on Jan. 29 at the
Bently Club in Harrisburg.

Defazio went into the tournament
seeded fourth, and winning the
finals came as a pleasant surprise.

“It was the first time I really
played somebody that good," he
said of his victory. “It was great. I
played the best I ever did, and it was
a fantastic experience.”

A native of Erie, Pa., Defazio
transferred to Pitt this year after
attending Penn State-Behrend for
three years.

Defazio was playing in a tourna-
ment in Indiana, Pa., when he met
Tom Cornelius, president of the
Pittsburgh Handball Association
(PHA), and Cornelius told Defazio
to contact him when he got to
Pittsburgh.

It was the association that spon-
sored the trip to Harrisburg, and, for
his efforts, Defazio was named the
PHA player of the month.

Training at the City Club in Mon-
roeville and at the Trees Hall courts
at least three times a week, he is also
helped along in his efforts by his
coach, Bob Nell.

“We work out at Trees, I don’t just
work out on the courts,” said Defa-
zio. “I put a lot of time in on all
aspects of my training —— running,
lifting and, especially, working on
my upper body strength."

With the state championship
over, the 23-year-old business major
will now be looking ahead to the
regional tournament coming up at
the Franklin Club in Michigan,
where he will likely be facing some
top 20 players such as Dave Doh-
man, the fourth-ranked player in the
country.

“I’m just going to have to play the
best I can,” hesaid. “I beat better
guys at states, so I have to go in and
believe that I can beat whomever I
play, regardless of how high he‘s
ranked." V
