-7% Faculty To Debate

, by GLENDA MINSHULL

' 2 Prepared to face strong opposi-
tion to.their proposal Saturday,
the ‘Advisory Committee’ on Op-

, portunities for Women (ACWO)

. =‘-«will urge the Facu1ty’of Arts and

"Sciences (FAS) to establish a

‘A women’s studies program at Pitt. _

Objections to the proposal ap-
pear to be primarily structural
and revolve around the job classi-
fication of the programs faculty
and the program’s funding.

Dr. Jerome Rosenberg, Dean
of the FAS, hopes to fund the pro-
gram through a grant fromlthe
"National Foundation for the Eu-
dow .nent of the Humanities.

_zHowever, Dr. Marcia Landy,
Associate Professor of English
and ACWO member,‘ felt that
funding was no longer an issue
since the ACWO was assured by
I Chancellor Posvar that monies
‘i‘.§..were available to fund the pro-
1" gram without budget cuts from
other departments and existing
programs. . '

_ The proposal calls for the hir-

sions of a radical women’s liber-
ation movement under the guise
of an academic program.

Since this program would en-
compass many facets (women in

society, language and social roles, »
etc.), Landy believes it cannot be.

rigidly. structured because its

emphasis is not directed towards "

a specific department in the Uni-
versity, but is rather multi-disci-
plinary in nature. '

However, the program’s pro-
posed structure has. met with
strong opposition. from at least
one faculty member. .

Dr. Irwin Schulman, Associate
Professor, of Political Science,
although supporting the estab-
‘lishment of a women‘s studies
program,-is opposed to the speci-
fic proposal on the grounds that
"it is“not particularly well-~dr_aft-
ed.” Labeling the proposal ambi-
guous, he felt that the faculty of
the program should not be an au-
tonomous group, and that without
some definite responsibility to a
department, there would be no

way to insure the high .quality of ’

the program. The lack of account-
ability, Schulman argued, could
lead to “shoddy work.”-

If the proposal is accepted, the
program_ _will be established
through the dual approach of as-
-similating existing departmental
courses and encouraging new
courses from thesocial sciences.

The proposal _will be presented
at the FAS meeting_Saturda’y at 9

The group circulating a petition
for the impeachment of the Stu-

and members of the Social Com-
mission is currently suffering
from internal dissension as well
as external attacks.

A formal statement on the pe-
tition was presented to the Pitt
News last Sunday by Joe Forbes.
The statement listed_ Forbes as
chairman of the group.

However, the other members
of the group claim otherwise. Ac-
cording to various circulators of
the petition, the group is a rather
informal body, and is open to all

interested students. There is no‘

formal chairman, they agree.

According to Forbes, the group

made an abrupt about-face at the

_Bell Telephone of Pittsburgh
has acquired Abbie Hoff nan’s
' Steal This Book and has used its
' suggestions to apprehend Pitt stu-
dents who have not been able to
avoid the temptation ‘of a free tel‘
ephone call. —

Pitt‘ students who have pre-
viously used false credit card
numbers, or have “borrowed“
someone elses, were required to
pay the cost of those calls. Detec-
tive Charles Graham of the Cam-
pus Police said that due to the

_ great increase of false credit card

use, Bell will no longer contact
students through the Campus Po-
lice, but will prosecute.

Graham said that Bell had ar-.

ranged to meet with students, re-

' quire payment for cos-t and drop

court procedures. “But even in
some of those cases,” he said, “a

It 7 ‘$600 bill can be a hard debt to

make up.”
Since August, Campus Police-

men have atte npted to inform
students of the great cost of tele-
phone fraud.

Graham estimated, "For each

call, a student would have to first '

pay the cost of that call, an aver-
age $50 fine per call, and a court
cost of about $11. Five 25 cent
calls, when Bell prosecutes, will
cost the student approximately
$306.20. Frankly, I don't want to
see anybody have to pay that.” he
said.

“Bell could’ve begun sending
subpoenas, or just consulted a
magistrate, which would have re-

sulted in an arrest. But the cur-

rent upswing in fraudulentcalls
prompted Bell to become more
strict,” Graham commented.

"We aren't preaching or threaten-

CAS Option offers Flexibility,

Ambitious Students Plan  M(tj0rs

by EVAN PATTAK
Associate Editor

A plucky lad in the College of
Arts and Sciences is majoring in
physics. biology. psychology.
math, and computer science. I

Impossible? A few years ago it
would have been. but this ambi-
tious student has taken advan-
tage of a CAS option to design a
60-credit major in computer pro-
gramming for the sciences.

Since the initiation of the self-'

designed major program in the
CAS in-November of 1968, 43 stu-
dents have proposed and received
approval for individually-planned
majors. In addition, more than 40
proposals. are currently under
study.

Dr.’ Rae Siporin. Assistant Dean
of the College of Arts and Sci-

ences. said that she was "very

pleased" with the number of stu-
dents participating in the pro-
gram. ' ‘

"That‘s quite a considerable
number when you consider that
it's a new program, individually-
designed. individually-tailored.

C(utdid(tte.HeiI1.z Bemortns Job,

by VICKI TUTIN

The general production mana-
ger of the corporation whose ket-

. chup loses the race hopes for op-
j posite results in his campaign for
the U.S. Congressional seat of the

18th District.

Speaking before a private meet-
ing of Pitt faculty from his dis-
trict, University of Pittsburgh
Trustee John Heinz, said Wednes-

_day he hopes to strike the word

politician from the list of dirty
words of the year by being "as
specific as possible about the
kinds of things that make sense. "

. In his talk, Heinz gave top prior-
to the present scarcity of jobs.
“We cannot realistically deal with

I _ ending the war in Vietnam if there

are no jobs for veterans to return
to,” he said. “We cannot realistic-
ally reform welfare in this coun-

‘ try if there are no jobs for people

once they are removed from wel-
fare roles.” ~

To achieve this end, Heinz pro-
posed to President Nixon in Aug-
ust of this year a federal income
tax cut of five per cent in favor of
a tax reform that would eliminate
the loopholes which “plague the
little guy and make his burdens
increasingly hard to carry.“

Concerned with the problem of
_"structual” unemployment.

Heinz voiced support for the pro-
posal of a federal job bank to help
move the man to the job. Training
programs, education. subsidiza-
tions of moving expenses. he sug-
gested, are incentives to finding
people work.

“We must get the man and the
job together." he said.

Concerning the Vietnam war,
Heinz stated Congress’ setting a
date to end the war could possi-
bly weaken the President’s hand.
He said, “I want there to be a
clear understanding that no po-
litics are to be played with our
prisoners of war.”

Heinz considers the draft" lot-
tery system coupled’ with the
elimination of deferments the best
possible option at the present. He
said that a volunteer army ap-
pears feasible until one considers
that the volunteers would prob-
ably be the underprivileged. poor.
and uneducated, forced into the
service because of a lack of al-
ternatives.

The educational system would
be another target of Heinz‘ re-
forms.

“I think we should de-empha-
size the popular cognitive ap-
proach and stress a developmen-
tal approach,” he said. '

According to Heinz, restructur-
ing should begin at the bottom

with federal models for experi-
mental programs. He spoke in
favor of federal grants and loans
for post-secondary students,. both
in college and in vocational train-
ing.

Regarding social welfare, Heinz
suggested de-centralization, spe-
cifically in the labor department.
He said, “I want to see more local
input and utilization of funds."

Speaking of future priorities,
Heinz stressed the necessity to
“find answers to urban decay,
fanning out rapidly from center
cities into the suburbs.”

and it hasn‘t gotten a whole lot of
publicity." she said.

Siporin said that most of the
students who have structured
their own majors “know what
they’re about.” ‘

"It’s not for people who don't
know what they want to do." she
added. .

The program benefits students
who find that their intended ma-
jor areas of study transcend the
restrictions of a single depart-
ment. Under the guidance of a fac-
ulty sponsor, students combine
courses from a wide range of dis-
ciplines, often employing other
CAS options, such as taking as
many. as 12 non-CAS credits or en-
rolling f'or courses at other city
schools in the cross ‘registration
plan.

Five students have designed
majors in religious studies. Sev-
eral have developed majors in
computer programming. Other
self-designed major areas include
such diverse fields as advertis-
ing, architecture, and Byzantine
studies. ,

Sc(trcit'y

"We must meet the challenge_

of developing open spaces, clean-
ing up the environment and creat-'
ing new jobs and industries," he
said. '

Heinz‘ lecture, given in the SU '

Supper Room, was organized by
Dr. James Cobb, assistant profes-
sor of Chemical Engineering, in
collaboration with the Young Re-«
publicans. The meeting was to
acquaint the faculty members of
Heinz" district with his viewson
pertinent topics and to stimulate
an academic input ‘into national
government.

and, again. because of the vague-
ness of thedocument. it fails to
specify the percentage of the stu-
dent body required to participate.

Steinberg. ‘ '
Bill Markus, director of Stu-
dent Activities, said he has not
yet been approached by the peti-
tioners. If and when the petition
is brought to him. he said, he is
uncertain as to what action would
be taken. ''I‘d have to do research

Markus also pointed out that
formal charges would have to be

-filed against the accused mem-

bers, with some basis of proof a
necessity. Also, the members
would have to be permitted to of-
fer evidence in their own defense.
He noted that the trials could

Markus cited the vagueness of
the Constitution as another limit-
ing factor. Assuming the charges
are not merely founded on pers'_o_n—

perhaps the most constructive ac-

SIPORIN: “Very pleased.”

Beatrice Weinberg has design-
ed a major in dance therapy. de-
fined by. the American Dance
Therapy Association , as "the
planned use of any aspect of dance
or movement to aid in the physical
and psychic integration of the in-
dividual." ,

"It‘s a tremendously exciting
field," said Weinberg. "When

,0.-

people have problems, they can't .

always understand them. But
their bodies show them. What
dance therapy does is say, ‘Okay,
there’s the symptom—let’s un-
derstand it and let‘s get rid of it.'"

Weinberg combines courses
from the departments of speech,

physical education, and psycholo--

gy, in addition to spending be-
tween three and six hours dancing
daily. And, because the Associa-

- tion requires it of all prospective

dance therapists, she must teach
dancing to normal children for at
least. one year.

“It seems," laughed Weinberg,

"that I’m always either dancing
or trying to get some rest."

Ruth Westerman has styled a If

38-credit program in medical il-
lustrating, drawing from the
fields of biology. art, fine arts,
and physical education.

“At first,” she said, “I was in-
terested in art and biology, just
trying to get a general background
in each.” But when she tripped
over the requirements for a bio-
logy major, Westerman decided
a self-designed. major would be
more useful to her.

"If I were going to be a biology‘
major,“ she said, "I'd have to

take all the chemistry and phy-'

sics courses I wouldn’t need."

. Students planning their own ma- ”
jors must first find a sponsor .- .

from the Faculty of Arts and Sci-
ences, submit a rationale to the
CAS explaining the plan, and pre-

pare a list of courses that total at
.least 36 credits and are chosen

from at least three disciplines or
schools.

Siporin_said that the course list
was “basic” rather than final, al-

‘.

lowing flexibility for the substitu-’-$3’:

tion of new, germane courses.

_ Although a self-designed najor,
isusually approved when its plan-
ner is about to declare a major,

dents whovhave completed a tra-
ditional major but have sufficient
spare credits are also creating

-Wrtge Freeze Scored

by TOM HEIPLE
President ' Nixon’s wage-price
freeze met with a barrageof crit-
icism at a panel discussion Mon-

day night. ‘ '
The discussion was conducted
by members of the Pitt Pro-

fession Union iPPU l. a new
union that is still organizing
and seeking recognition as a

bona fide negotiating body for
salaried personnel working for
the University.

Dr. David Bramhall. profes-
sor of economics. claimed that
because there are no controls on
stocks. bonds. profits. land val-
ues. and interest rates. the effect

of Phase I is very lopsided in,

favor of the non-wage earner.
He also suggested that the freeze

has shifted the distribution of’

lI1C0.l1€ in favor of

earners.

-Bramhall said the program has
been more effective in control-
ling wages than prices because
wages are generally centralized.
'l‘he policing of prices. he
said. mostly has been left up to
the consumer.

Supposedly. according to
Bramhall. the freeze was to
have reduced une.nployment.
through’ a reduction of taxes

non-wage

on businesses that invest in capi-n

tal equipment.

Bramhall argued that .the
freeze. instead of holding down

» inflation could just be postpon-

ing it until after the controls are
lifted. assuming they will be.

He concluded that Nixon’s
new economic policy is to a
large extent “admission of the
failure of the mythical free mar-
ket system.”

Tom Quinn. of the United
Electrical Workers termed the
freeze "a very singular threat
to collective bargaining
today. We,vsee a period ahead

be in a strait-jacket."

Dr. l\/Iontgomery. of the His--
tory Department. claimed that
inflation has been caused by
"administrative pricing.“ where-
by the company sets its prices
according to how much profit

~ it wants and not supply and

demand.

Amplifying Montgomery's re-
marks. Quinn cited the auto ,in-
dustry where. he said. “the unit
labor cost hasn’t risen one cent
in 20 years. "

He also reads a part of the
Washington Calling column of
the Sunday Pittsburgh Press, in
which businessmen. for 1972.

forecast a 12-15 per cent increse
in profits.

Montgomery said the wage

increases for salaried personnel,

is a little less than the cost of
living minus the income tax.

Two studies recently released
by the University of Pittsburgh
suggest a striking relationship be-
tween the cost of higher educa-
tionand the socioeconomic level
of students.

Specifically, the studies show
that Pitt students tend to come
from families with lower in-
comes and less formal education
than their counterparts at pub-
lic universities nationally, but
that each tuition» increase at
Pitt erodes the representation of
lower economic groups in the
studentbody. ’

The studies were directed by
Diane Palmer of Pitt’s Office of
Institutional Research and Plan-

ning Studies. The first. com-
pleted this summer. compares
the socioeconomic status "of

Pitts student body aseof fall
1970 with the status of stu-
dents at other public institutions.
The second; completed October
I after data for the current term
became "available. compares
the freshman classes at Pitt from
1960 through 1971. ' .

The median family income of
the 1971 freshman class at Pitt
was $11,033. The median parent-
al income for freshmen at public
universities nationally as of fall

1970‘(the 1971 figure is not yet-

available) was $13,587.

' The Pitt freshman classes of
1964 and 1965. the last .f_resh-
men admitted before state affili-
ation. had median family in-
comes of $11,439 and $12345.

ped to $225 per term and the

median family income of enter-
ing freshnen decreased corre-
spondingly to $10903. In 1967.
median family incomes de-
creased still further—to $10.009.

Since 1968, the University
has been obliged to raise its
tuition each fall. , The ‘per-
term tuition rates for the past
four years have been $275, $355,
$425, and $485, respectively.
Median family incomes of en-
tering freshmen’ have risen
proportionately during these
years: $10,302 (1968), $10,668
(1969), $10,941 (1970), and $11,-
033 (1971).

The percentage of' students
in each freshman class who are
the first generation in their
family to go to college follows
the same general pattern as does
median family income. In 1964.
the percentage‘ of first-genera-
tion college-going freshmen at

Pitt was 49.9. By 1967. the
second state-related year. that
percentage had risen to 70.4.

But as tuition rose in 1968 and
again in each succeeding year.
the percentage of first-generation
college—going freshmen dropped.
Each tuition increase. the study
concludes. seemed to eliminate
students from families with a
marginal commitment to higher
education.

student organizations. This lack of guide-

F lines for the allocations procedure has
i’,_led to some arbitrary decisions based on

A  spurious rationalizations.

One measure that the Constitutional

‘ tency in allocations. In the absence of

specific criteria, the Social Commission

 and the Allocations Committee ha_ve'waf—

  AWS Backs Studies A

(Editor's Note—This is an open letter to Dean Jerome Ros-
enberg of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, from Cathy Ritts,
president of AWS, on the Women’s Studies proposal.)

As you. no doubt are aware, a Women‘s Studies proposal
has been prepared and will be presented before the FAS for
vote tomorrow. The Associated Women Students. as the rep-
résentative body of the undergraduate women. wishes to ex-

-about funding the Pitt Bowling Club.
-That

organization was given $214 in or-
der that a handful of members could,
well,bowl.

The funding body also balked at fin-
ancing the Hill Education Project. a
group of students that tutors underprivil-
eged children. One reason given for de-
laying and possibly denying. funds was
that the Project incurred a deficit last
year and may be fiscally irresponsible. A

In the spring. the Owl was given al-
most .$5000 to erase a deficit. Though the
grant was coupled with a plan that will
supposedly keep’the yearbook in the
black. asked an investigation of the Owl’s
fiscal responsibility.

Perhaps the —question that ‘must be
asked is not-which of these organizations
should be funded, but should any of
them be funded. Students, it seems, are
getting little return on their $24 yearly
Activities Fee.

There are many organizations they

"help support but cannot join. Without a

certain amount of expertise. they cannot
join the publications or the Debate Un-
ion. If they commute. they cannot join

 

.VIen's Dorm Council or Womenls Hous-
ing board. both of which additionally ex-
_clude members of one sex.

Or. if students expect some services
from organizations whose costs they help
underwrite. they may again be disap-
pointed. Of what benefit is the Pitt Cap-
sule 'to students not enrolled in Pharma-
cy‘? If the Glee Club promotes good pub-
lic relations for the University. why
doesn't the University foot its bill‘?

Another way of viewing student organ-
izations, apparently the prevailing view,
is as a rich, diverse network of learning
experiences for students supported by a
tax (the Activities Fee). This tax, though
it sometimes benefits individual payers,
is rather intended for the good of the
student constituency as a whole.

This formula raises additional prob-
lems. For instance. how does one define
a legitimate interest. and how many stu-
dents must share it before it is eligible
for funds? ‘

If‘ four or five“of us formed the Pitt
Bocci Club or the Pitt Yo—Yo Club. we
would have as valid a clai_m on student
funds as any. student organization.-

That these problems demand rapid
remedy may be illustrated by the Chan-
cellor’s recent approval of his student ad-
visory committee’s recommendation to
award three of the SA Commissioners
wages from Activities Fees‘.

In the spring. the social Commission
and the Allocations Committee agreed
that no salaries would be paid from Ac.-
tivities Fees. By okaying salaries for the
Commissioners. the Chancellor and his
advisory committee have circumvented
the allocations process entirely‘. ‘

  U itiversity Concerts

Editor:

. 7In. my four ‘years here at Pitt.

I have seen several student gov-

. ernments come and go. _Nearly
all of then have met with con-

siderable opposition. or at least

 very vocalopposition. »

The present Student Associa-

tion seems to be no exception. It

will not be my intention to take
sides in the current. long-run-
ning feud between the Student
Association and Pat O'Brien etc.
I simply wish to speak for my-
self. -one of the 60 percent of the

I , undergraduates that Pat mention-

ed in his articles (commuters I.

As a commuter. I have felt
and have experienced those things

‘that Pat mentioned. i.e. losing
.-an hour or more each day com-
ing to Oakland. and heading for

the nearest bus stop. For three

, years. I was no more a part of

this school than winning teams

 were.

This year. however. 1 am try-

-ing to attend some of the eyents

-. had

,

ter.

_I cannot picture going to the
Civic Arena for one, though. I
feel that my parent’s. car (and
mine, when it's running) are saf-
er parked in Oakland than they
are parked at the Civic Arena
lots.

Therefore. ‘concerts "in Oak-
land appeal to me as a commut-
er f'or two reasons: parking here
and not downtown. and. ideally.
it might give me./a chance to
meet some of the students here. '

Also. I have had to bus it many
times. But at this point. becom-
ing involved in the school and

feeling a part of the University _

community is worth the incon-
venience.

If it is decided that deficits’

for big name groups is an un-

a necessary evil, then may I sug-

gest that possibly an effort
should be made to bring in tal-
ent that is up and coming, or
new.

Last -February. C-ML? had Sea-
train in concert. The group had
their first albun released

stitutes -damage-is at best a. sub-
jective one. Following the mail-
ing of our report to the tenant
we'are available to discuss "and

Lrmded

of the group then. but I am sure
that it was much less than it is
now. eight months later.

A major objection does seem
to be the deficits incurred by
having top-drawer talent. If we
are to have big-naine talent
on campus. and considering the
conditions that Pat listed (small
seating capacities. etci. then de-
ficits are to be expected.

I don’t mind the deficits as
long as part of the deficit doesn’t
go into Lenny Klavonic’s wallet.
And as yet, no one has been able
to show that they are.

In brief. I feel that concerts
here are a must and this money
_spent on them does not bother me
personally as long as it does for
concerts and nowhere else. If

-commuters organize their free

time around local community
events. as Pat has stated they do.
then they have made a decision.

As a commuter, I have made
mine. I would like the opportun-
ity to attend Pitt concerts.

Morganand Goldberg
  Could Both Learn

Editor :

Almost every article I read in the Oct. 15th issue of the Pitt
News was well-written and informative.

I hope all our "revolutionary activists“ read Mike Simon's ex-
cellent article about the necessity of entertainment at the rally.

I especially enjoyed the intelligence shown in Even Pattak’s ar-
ticle about Lucianne Goldberg. I was at the “debate” scheduled
between Robin Morgan and Goldberg. Morgan’s speech was bril-
liant and professionally delivered. Those of us who respect her had
even more reason to do so. '

Some of us decided to listen to the "du nb sex-object" who fol-

lowed her. As Pattaks article ‘showed. she was intelligent and rea-
listic. Inall but a few respects. she is a Women's Liberationist.

".1;-.u..-..  ..

 

Certainly Morgan could teach her a, great deal. but Morgan~ 

could learn from listening to Goldberg. We women are treated as
things; and taught to be subordinate to men. But our generation of
women will never see full equality. ' ~

We have to fight for it, get some benefit for ourselves, and
more for the next generation. . "

But meanwhile. we have to live with our sexist men _and our
sexist selves. Hating my husband won't get me out ofthe kitchen.

I'd like Ms. Goldberg to know there are many» more important

elements in the Women’s Movement than hostility toward men. And .—

the people who walked out on" her should remember that we can’t
learn from our own echoes. ' I »

To those who wanted the men to shut up or even leave. I would
say. "You have become what you hate." Also. I'd like to know what
happens to the wife-beater‘s wife after the karate—trained women
leave.’ ' ’ '

Panthers: We’ll Cheer for Y

 Editor‘:

-Over the course of the past de-
cade. members of our generation,
have decried the traditional "My
country right or wrong" attitude.

Now it would appear that Dave
Havern. John Moss. and others of
the Panther football team are ad-
vocating a return to this attitude
in respect to the spectator-team
relationship.

In the Pitt-Navy game of Oct. 9.
the Panthers played against a
recognized weak team. the mid-
dies. .In three previous games.
Navy had been able to garner only
nine points while giving up an in-
credible 151 points.

Jewish Studies

"”’Progr(tnt Needed

Editor:

I recently read a flyer pertain-
ing to a program of Jewish Studies
here at Pitt. I recall that last year
there was mention of a committee
that was meeting on the subject,
and wonder why it is taking so
long to put such a program to-
gether?

What has the University been
doing about culturally educating
their Jewish students?

There_is a genuine need and de-
sire on the part of the student
body for a Jewish Studies pro.-'
gram to take immediate effect’.
Other ethnic and culture groups

/“have had complete depart nents

developed, while Jewish Studies
continues only-to be discussed.
They were not ignored—why are
we? _

The popularity of the “History
of Modern Israel” course is just
another proof that more Jewish
Study courses should be estab-
‘lished and would certainly main-

Ctain large enrollments.

As a Jewish student, I know the
demand is great and would like to
see results before it is too late for

me to take advantage of the pro-‘

gram.

Sari Silvern
CAS. ‘74

But in the first half of the Pitt-
Navy game, Navy easily obtained
35 points, almost four times as
many as in their three previous
outings combined, while yielding
only 10 points to the Panthers.

The Pitt fans. with memories
of that beautiful UCLA victory
and the fairly respectable show-
ing against Oklahoma. one of the
nations top teams. were stung.
hurt. humiliated and any one of a
hundred other emotions.

The Pantherteam they saw in
the first half was not the one they
knew. The Panthers made serious
and costly mistakes and did not
play anywhere near their capabil-
ities. The fans knew this and at

- the half, they booed their own

team.

If the disgruntled members of
the Panther team will stop for a
second, they might realize that
the fans, like the players, are also

let down by sloppy play on the-

part of the team.

Friday, October 22,

on If...

If the Panthers expect the fans
to cheer "Our Panthers. Right or
Wrong" they are going to be let
down.

The fans don't boo for respect-
able performances (and that doe-
n‘t mean just victories) but rather
they express their displeasure at

. sub-par showings.

If the fans are no longer per-
mitted to express their views vo-
cally, then football will become an
emotionless occurrence for many
people.

We, the fansysupport you in
your efforts, Panthers, and we
hope that our criticism will not
cause more anger on your part but
rather will show you that we are
concerned and involved in your
performances. Good luck in 1971.

PEACE CORPS Volunteers examine a cucumber patch in Honduras.

Recruits Sought By  
» Peace Corps, VISTA

Prospective applicants should
have their applications in be-
fore November in order to qual-
ify for the spring training
session and -by January for the
fall session. This applies to both
VISTA and the Peace Corps.

Service in VISTA is fora

4 minimum of one year. During

this time the volunteer receives
a living allowance and a month-
ly stipend of $50.00 .,paid in total
at the end of the volunteer’s ser-
vices.

Peace Corps volunteers serve
a minimum of two years and are
given a living allowance plus a
$75.00 per month salary also paid
at the end of the volunteers
service.

Though organizations have
training periods, the Peace Corps‘
is considered ‘fairly intense’
since it includes a crash course
in the foreign language that
the volunteer will be speaking.

Bell warned that both Peace
Corps and VISTA volunteers
have lost their draft deferred
status. “This unfortunately cost-
us a few applicants,” she said.
“We now determine an appli-
cant’s status before we will pro-
cess his applications.

“Some draft boards however.
allow Peace Corps and VISTA
volunteers to qualify for alterna-
tive service." she added.

“Both organizations have
changed greatly since they were
started,“ said Bell. “At first we
had a lot of people with an
emotional involvement. but with
few real skills; now we are
turning towards the more
capable volunteer. Sympathy
just doesn't help the people."

Anyone desiring more infor-
mation on the Peace Corps
should call (215)-597-2129 (col-
lect). VISTA material can be
obtained at (800 )--124-8580
(toll-free ).

Centers On Import-Export

Stugdjeat-Run Firm Organized

by STEVE LUBETSKY

A student-run corporation de-
signed to give students first-hand
business experience is presently
being organized at Carnegie-.Vlel-
lon University.

Krishnahadi Pribadi. a research
fellow at C-MU and advisor for the
project. explained that "students
will hold executive positions and
they will write the charter."

"A trio of students will be work-
ing together‘ in‘ place of a chief’
executive." he said.

Romesh Wadhwani, a graduate
student in Electrical Engineering
at C-MU and a participant in the
program, said that the idea for
the project “started with a‘ lead-

ership training seminar at Pitt
involving students, faculty, and
business leaders.”

The corporation. Wadhwani re-
marked. was formed on the pre-
mise that “education is not suffi-
cient for entrepeneurial skills.
which is what the corporation will
seek to develop."

The corporations focal "point

will be inports-exports. which.
Wadhwani explained, represents
"a-business activity not requiring
a large amount of capital. and it
insures the chances of survival,
since the failure ratefor this is
low."

The objectives of imports-ex-

ports, he said are two-fold—“to I

“White Racist Image’
 Makes LEAP alter

LEAP, a Pitt YMCA service
project which aims to help high
school students from low income
families prepare for college. is

not-‘reaching its full potential be-

cause of racial tension. according
to Jim Oppenheimer. He noted
that black volunteers are des-

perately needed to work with =

black high school students.

“ But Oppenheimer added, "At-
tempts to get black participation
have not been effective because
the YMCA does not have the trust
of the University‘s black’ com-
munity, possibly because of the
white racist image of the YMCA
nationally."

He continued, “The black com-
munity at Pitt is not interested in
white projects because many of

the white people working in them «

are insincere or liberal do-good-
ers. But if blacks get into these
projectsthey can make them a
hell of a lot more effective.”

This year LEAP is operating. in
conjunction with the Upward

Bound Program at Carlow -C,ol-.

lege. Upward Bound is a federally
funded ag_encyw,i~th a professional
staff. It aims to help students who
have the potential to go to college

but who are not making it. Volun-
teer tutor students in math, sci-
and .

ence, English. Spanish, '
French. Oppenheimer added that

black, volunteers are especially «
-needed because they can relate to

the problems of black high school
students.

At present 15 Pitt students have
volunteered. Fifteen to 20 more
are needed. Volunteers donate
about two hours a week to the pro-

gram. Along with tutoring. some '
individuals will counsel students-

in applying to and selecting a col-
lege. The project will start op-
erating-in about two weeks and
will continue until April. At pre-
sent only two blacks have volun-
teered. 1

Last year the Upward Bound
Program at Carlow worked with
58 students from-‘Schenley High
School. Students from the LEAP
' program will gain experience by
working at the Carlow project this
year. Then next year they hope to
open a similar program at Pitt.

give students a broader know-
ledge of trade, and to be relevant
to both Americans and foreigners.
There is a big demand for entre-
peneurs abroad.”

"There will be equal emphasis
on both exports and imports,"
Wadhwani commented. "Students
often find it easier to ‘deal with
imports alone. “

Activities which this area will

~ include. he said, are a market

study which would provide infor-
mation about investment risks.
and a consultancy service.

“The corporation,” Pribadi
mentioned, “will be working
closely with the local business
community. The Oakland Cham-
ber of Commerce has expressed
interest,” he said. -

Pribadi stressed. however. that
the corporation's success “de-

pends on manpower. We would -

like to have 10 to 20 students on a
part-time basis and help from
other collegesas well as C-MU."

According to Pribadi. the cor-

poration will offer several in-

centives to generate student in-

"terest. “The key benefit," he em-

phasized, “will be the experience
of running a firm." Furthermore,
student participants can receive
academic credit, he added.

“Our main problem right now
is funding,” Pribadi admitted.
“Once we have funds and a. perm-
anent staff things should go
smoothly.”

For more information, students
can contact Pribadi at 687-7622, or
621-1100, ext. 315.

’esi(lent Tuition Levy 

HARRISBURG (API — The
chairman of the Senate Appropri-

~ ations Committee predicts out-of-

state college students, now con-
sidered Pennsylvania voting resi-
dents. will soon be clamoring for

resident tuition rates at state sup-

ported schools.

"This will cost the Common-
wealth $10,637,672 next year,"
Senator‘ Benjamin R. Donolow
(D.-Philadelphia) said Tuesday,
attacking last»month's_ opinion by
the attorney general to allow col-
.lege students to vote on campus.

f‘The right to vote is the highest
privilege of citizenship,” "Dono-

low said. “So how can lesser priv-

ileges be denied?“

Peter Brown, deputy attorney
general who worked on the opin-
ion, commented later that tuition
residency requirements would not
be a problem. Schools owned or fi-
nancially related to the state of-

fer lower ,fees to residents of

Pennsylvania.

"That opinion only dealt with
student residence f'or voting pur-

poses and did not deal with tui-
tion remission,” Brown said.

He added that residency can be
established for a number of speci-
fic purposes, including welfare,

'automobile registration, and in-

heritance tax.

Donolow, who is an attorney,
said he didn’t think out-of-state
students would have any trouble

winning _a legal battle to get the

lower tuition rates. v

He said there are 11.132 non-
resident students in the state-
owned and state-related colleges.
Their tuition has been $898 to $1,-
020 higher than residents.

"Unless there is further clari-
fication of the opinion, it will have
a tremendous impact on next
year's budget,“ the senator said.

Brown said he was uncertain if
a further opinion would be need-
ed. If it is, he added, the new rul-
ing would probably be based on
the principle that parents of res-
ident students contribute through
taxes to the subsidies given to the
schools.

The book traces his conversion
t'rom conventional teaching meth-
ods to the .nulti-niedia-apocalytic-
encounter approach he now em-
ploys in Life Science 80.

But Ivan Illych may rest easy.
In describing his current teaching
techniques, the ideas behind them,
and their application to elemen-
tary and secondary education,
Shostak’s emphasis is rarely on

‘ theory, but rather discovers about
people and teaching which Shos-

tak himself _has made during his
career. '

therefore. convincing support for
any particular educational princi-

a teacher with knowledge. imag-

ject and students makes for an

Shostak writes reasonably lu-
cid prose. If it lacks something of
the dynamism the man himself
possesses. the glimpses of inci-
dents and events and people in and
out.of the classroom that have
touched Shostak's life over the
years still renders the book em-

The Bill.has no provision’-for
counseling the veteran, and he of-
ten’ lacks information aboutother
possiblesources of aid and about
school‘ admission policies. Thus,
he is not aware of many opportun-
.ities ‘that’-could make enrollment
more feasible. The possibilities
of using GED (an army exam)
scores as a high school equival-
ency, «transfferring CLEP (a home
study program) credits, or enroll-
ing in ‘the PAVE educational pro-
gramjfor veterans" thus remain
unknown and unused. .

 

  .dji1istnient Problems Trouble

The insufficiency of the GI Bill
keeps some veterans from going
to school. ‘Many veterans
that they can survive better on
the unemployment rolls. The ne-
cessity of getting -a job (in some
cases full time» to return to
school does not allow some vet-
erans full participationrin campus
activity. '

The estrangement of the veter-.
an as a student is sometimes in-.
creased by other students’ reac-
tions to his military service.

These vary from excitem_ent and »

awe to suspicion and silence. One

person may press for more war

stories while another faces him in the highlytouted environment

of “academic freedom.” Some be-- ,

accusingly. /_ _ .

  

Age is another factor that dis-

tinguishes: the veteran from fe'l-"

low students. One recently ex-
plained, “I’m too old for the
freaks, and the fraternity bit-is
too much.” The counter-culture

amovemepnt -blossomed while they
were overseas and they were not

a -part of it;' similarly, their ex-

periences have A taken them be--'
yond the image of ‘the college man “
, -as they remember it.

Many veterans also stated that

their slightly older age-created’

difficulties in dating their class-

mates they found girls hesitantto‘

go out with someone 24' or 26
years old. However, relation-
ships with women are also com-

plicated by the sexism inherent
‘in the ‘armed forces. Frequently

find _

the veterans complained that
their only contact with women
was through the USO. Red. Cross
nurses. and Playboy posters.

Upon return home. it is diffi-
cult to reconcile residual attitudes
formed in the service with the
growing,campus interest in lib-
eration and “natural“ relation-

ships. Veterans repeatedly point-I

ed out that facing women on a one-
to-one basis was initially discom-

fiting and frightening. _

ACADEMIC FREEDOM
One might wonder if the veter-
an, a product of the rigid military
system, has trouble functioning

lieve that their past experience

"enable them to better handle this
new-found freedom. One thought,

that "the service hastaught them

the sense of personalgresponsibil-_
ity" that the progressive. aca-‘

demic attitude requires.

_ Theyalso felt,more mature af-
ter their previous ‘experience,
which might help them to resist

_ the ‘heady effects of- reporting
‘only to themselves. '

.However, an opposite reaction

__to the military’s authoritarianism

is ‘found in the veteran Who real-

‘ized that he ‘_‘could” not take or-

ders any more.” Such a veteran
hoped the demands made upon a

student would not be a strain for _

him. - ' . _
Generally, any relaxation of or-

ders, regulations," and require-

ments is appreciated and respect-

_ed." One veteran who initially en-_ ’
rolled in engineering delightedly
‘viewed the department as rife

with student power and freedom.
The veteran/students service

history provides a unique vantage (

point for campus anti-war nove-

ments. Most mark the misinfor-\

mation about the war given. to the
public and students as a major
problem. The number of war atro-
cities and body-counts were cited

‘as two examples of. the discrepan-
'cies between the war as they saw
it and as others are" told of it. A I

helicopter rescue pi-lot revealed,
“During one skirmish, the num-
ber of casualities, that I saw was

as high as the administrations to-
tal." -

Those against the war hope for
a greater involvement from the
students and the veterans on cam-
pus alike. Some see the move-
ment attracting, in addition to the
large number of seriously com-
mitted students, “some faddists
and individuals with ulterior mo-
tives, conscious or. unconscious,
such as a desire to avoid the
draft.”

However, they deem any‘ in-"

 crease in student awareness ne-

cessary so the war will not be con-.

sidered_a “dead" issue by those
' in power. Some of these veterans
are slightly dubious about current
a demonstrations, and although
they see them as useful‘, they be-
‘lieve the movement may ‘need
otherjtactics to be most effective.

_There are presently two rel-
atively new organizations open to
the Pitt student who is a veteran.
One is the Veterans‘ at Pitt (VAP).
It is basically a service organiza-
-tion which works with other Pitt
groups on any special projects
which they may require help in
completing.

In -addition‘, it devotes itself to I

counseling veterans in common
problems,’ It "holds no
._political or military ties, and its
members comprise a cross-sec-
tion of all veterans. .
Their office is locatedon the
fifth floor of the Student Union.

Another organization is the

-Vietnam Veterans Against .the

War -(VVAW). In addition to their

major goal of ending the war. the

VVAW is involved in drug rehabi-
. itation for- veterans, counter-re-
cruiting at the Federal Building,
the upcoming elections, an infor-
mation center to promote aware-
ness of all benefits and programs
for vets, reaching those in the
area on active duty,and in the re-
serves, political ‘education, and
combating the sexism and racism
they see as a part of the military
complex. ‘ .

They are located above the Oak- ,

land Co-Op on the Boulevard of the
Allies.

The 1971 NCAA college loot-
ball season rambles on to its sev-
enth full_ week tomorrow, with
Notre Dame-USC. North Caro-
lina-Wake Forest.
bama. Oh.o State-Wiscon_sin.
and Florida State-South Carolina
being‘ five of the most critical
contests on the schedule.

Sparked by. the nations sting-
iest rushing defense, the punch-
less Fightin Irish will have their
hands -full with the Trojans. even
in South Bend. Last year, before
a nationwide TV audience, QB
Jimmy Jones led hisunderdog
Southern Cal squad to a s.nash-
mg 38-28 upset victory over the
eventual Joe Theisman—led Cot-
ton Bowl champs.

Despite USC‘s present 2-4 re-
cord. Notre Dane cannot afford
to underestimate Coach John Mc-
Kay's team. The only season
blemishes for Coach Ara Parse-
ghian and ND in 1964 and 1970
were created by the Trojans.

Battling to retain its 1970 ACC
crown, Wake Forest must defeat
North Carolina-to remain in con-
tention with Clemson and the.
(NC) Tar Heels, both unbeaten
in league play. A Deacon (WF)
loss would put them out of the
race, while a Deacon triumph

. _would force a three-way tie for

the runnerup spot with Duke.

Paul (Bear) Bryant‘s resurgent
Crimson Tide risk their 6-0 mark
against the explosive ‘Houston

the country are drea nily antici-
pating a "wishbone spectacular"

For the second week in a i'ow.
the Pitt Panthers seek their third
win of the season on unfriendly
grounds as they attempt to shoot
down the high flying Boston Col-

lege Eagles at Alumni Stadium

' at Chestnut ‘Hill. .\1assachuset-ts.
Coach Joe Yukica's Eagles have
compiled a 4-2 record this year.
with both losses coming on the
road. The first was a 45-14 drub-
bing at the hands of the West
Virginia Mountaineers. while
they dropped, a close 14-6 deci-
sion to Texas Tech last weekend.
Spaced in between to BC's
two defeats was a skein of four
victories. Besides WVLT. the only
other common opponent for BC
and Pitt has been Navy. The Ea-
gles smashed the Middies 49-6.
while the Panthers‘ 36-35 victory
was anything but convincing.
BC’s strength lies mainly'in
its running game with Yukica
depending on two bull-like

* backs to move the ball. Halfback

Tom Bougus, a 210 pounder, has
maintained a six-plus. yard aver-
age per carry good enough to be
in the nation’s top ten. Fullback
Bill Thomas, who tips the scales
at 230 pounds, is gaining over
four yards per clip.

If Hyde is not up to par in

ing assignment. Simon, who

    

played well against the Green
Wave, is hopeful about this
week’s game. ‘

"The attitude on the club has
been real good this week." he
said. "We've got to start build-

season."

Incidentally. this game will be
the second one in a row on‘ the
new artificial turf. Pol_\‘turf. Al-
though complaints continued
about the Orange Bowls _sur-
face of it this week. Yukica and
the Eagles have found little prob-
lems with it in Boston.

The Panthers will have little
time to worryabout the problems
of the turf-BC will present
enough of its own tomorrow. _

Coitfereitce
For Pitt?

I by VINCE Di NARDO
Dating back to its origin,in 1898, the Pitt-West Virginia
football series has grown to become one of the most intense
rivalry games in Eastern football. Player personnel has had a
habit of taking a back seat to emotion in past games.

 

 

llII|IIIlIIIIIIIIIIIllIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIlllIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIE
.||lI||||I||I|||||l||I|lIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIllIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIE

This had been particularly evidenced in the last two games

of the series. Last year, WVU was to have the better personnel,
but were outclassed by the fired up Panthers, 36-35. The reverse
took place this year, as a supposedly undermannedii WVU squad
humbled Pitt, 20-9. Despite these two thrilling games, the Pitt-
West Virginia rivalry has lost some of its glamour.

After Pitt’s one point victory last year, WVU Coach Bobby
Bowden was literally fighting for his coaching life. Only a_ vic-
tory over Syracuse silenced the head—hunting Mountaineer fans.

In years preceeding the Big Four (Pitt, West Virginia,
Penn State, Syracuse) agreement, a Mountaineer win in the Pitt
game would have meant their entire season. This year, after de-
feating Pitt, Bowden was quoted as saying that"‘this is only half
of our season.” This indicates that Penn State and Syracuse have
moved in to create an intense four way rivalry.

The Big Four has rules and regulations concerning the re-

. cruiting and the red-shirting of the schools. A Big Four school is

permitted a limit of 100 football players in a four-year period
and a unanimous vote is required to redshirt an athlete. These
sound like conference rules rather than just a friendly agree-
ment.

This brings up an interesting question: Why doesn‘t the Big
Four team up and form a conference? ‘

“This thing always creeps up,” said Athletic Director Casi-
mir Myslinski. “But right now it is a dead topic.”

Apparently, conference talks have been a big part in the an-

' nual Big Four meetings for a few years now. Now, since a four‘

team conference seems illogical, “choosing” has become a key
word in the talks. -

“We want to be ‘very selective," Myslinskiwent on to say.
“We are talking about at least a six team minimum. Army and
Navy are two teams that have always been talked about.”

Other than Army and Navy, any major independent is a
worthy possibility. Boston College has been appearing on the
schedules of the Big Four schools with a consistent regularity.
Temple and Florida State have made spotted appearances. No-
tre Dame, South Carolina, Air Force, Miami, Georgia Tech and

Tulane also must fall under the “selective” label that Myslinski ’

spoke about. _

The financial advantages of a conference will be a .najor
factor if and when one is formed. » ’

“With a conference, there would be the possibility of a play-
off and a conference championship,” Myslinski said. '

‘And, with the possibility of a bowl,bid for the winner, it
could mean as much as $250,000 to the athletic department of a
conference champion. ‘ ‘

-Because of the repeated talks and the semi—conference set-
up that the Big Four already offers", there is a‘ good chance that
a conference for Pitt is only a few years away, even though the.
talks are now dead.

Clarke sighted lack of depth on
his team and Pitt Stadiums As-
tro Turf as potential problems
in the contest.

"We don't have a great deal of
depth.“ stated Clarke. "Early in
the season we didn't have our

complete starting lineup in — four '

of our starters were missing and
that hurt us a great deal.

 big factor in the game will
also be the weather — its alright
to play soccer on the Astro Turf
on a mild day but on .a hot day
heat becomes a factor and you
have to water down the field." ‘

. The Pitt j.v. booters concluded
their season with an 8-2 victory
over Indiana Wednesday. The
soccermen ended the year with
a 4-0-1 record (the tie occurred
against high ranking Allegheny
Community College).

Soccer enthusiasts will certain-
ly be able to get their fill of enter-
tainment this week-end provided
they show up at Pitt Stadium to-
morrow for what has been affec-
tionately termed "A Soccer .\lara-
