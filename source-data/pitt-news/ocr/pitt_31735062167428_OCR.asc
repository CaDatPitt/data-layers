University

Associate Dean of Students Dr.
Herbert McGibboney will leave
the University Friday. Dr. Mc-
Gibboney was formerly dean of
men from 1965 till April of this
year when the student affairs re-
organization was implemented.

Dr. McGibboney will assume
the position of dean of students
at Lake City College, a small lib-
eral arts school of about 3,000 stu-
dents. Lake City is located about
50 miles west of Jacksonville,
Fla.

The former dean of men said,
“there are a great many people
that I will miss. I’m leaving be-
hind many friends at the Univer-
sity.”

The problem related to student
insurrections were very much on
the mind of Dean McGibboney
as he pondered his departure. “I
hope Pitt never has to be the vic-
tim of the crisis situations that
have occured at other schools.”

Dean McGibboney leaves the
University with a wealth of ex-
perience. From 1949 to 1960, he
was instructor of physical educa-
tion at the University.

In 1960, the departing associ-
ate dean of students was appoint-
ed dean of men at Slippery Rock
State Teachers College. After two
years at that post, Dr. McGib-
boney was appointed dean of stu-
dents at Slippery Rock. He served
at the post for three years.

To'Appear
On WTAE H

The Pitt News is ready and
willing to defend its position on
any issue. Editor Paul Stoller will
appear on WTAE radio’s College
Forum, 1250 on the dial, Sunday
night at 8. He will define and de-
fend the recent series of articles
which has appeared in the News
concerning police attitudes to-
ward students.

The controversy began about
two weeks ago when reporter
Peggy Allen interviewed some of
the members of the North Side
Police Force. The comments she
received from them and subse-
quently printed prompted consi-
derable criticism.

Especially critical were other
district police departments, such
as the Oakland Police Force.
Miss Allen later talked to the
Oakland Police.

Academic Cabinet States  
Recommendations on ROTC

by RISE WEINBERG

The Academic Cabinet of Arts
and Sciences has released recom-
mendations concerning the lang-
uage requirement and ROTC.

The cabinet cited several rea-
sons why languages should be en-
couraged but not required. The
basic rationals behind the study of
foreign language have been that
most college students go abroad
within five years of graduation
and that most graduate schools
require foreign languages.

The cabinet stated, “The big-
gest issue is that it is hard to ac-
cept a rationale that requires two
years of language at the Univer-
sity because a student can spend
anywhere from one week to a
year or so abroad.” And many
students will visit a country
whose language they didn’t study
even with the requirement. As
far as graduate school require-
ments are concerned, many Uni-

University Gets Mellon Grant

The University School of Med-
icine is one of 30 medical schools
in the nation that will share $10
million grant from the Richard
King Mellon Charitable Trusts
for expanding and strengthening
their medical teaching.

Ten of the schools, including
the University School of Medi-
cine, will receive $100,000 each
year for the next five years.
Twenty others will recieve $50,-
000 each year for the same per-
iod.

Dr. F. Sargent Cheever, dean
of the University Medical School
faculty, said, “We will use this
gift to meet what is possibly the

faculties, and that at the end of
the five—year period, more feder-
al and private funds will be avail-
able for that purpose.”

The letter of announcement to
the deans of the medical schools
states: ‘‘You in a y allocate t h e
grant within your discretion and
need. We hope it will help to at-
tract some of the most promising
young physicians to your faculty
as full-time teachers in medi-
cine.”

All the schools receiving grants
are private medical schools. Since
there are 45 such schools in the
US, the Mellon grant will go to
almost three-fourths of the total.

versity students do not attend
graduate school a-t all. In addi-
tion, graduate schools are re-eval-
uating their own language re-
quirements. In light of these ob-
servations, the cabinet made the
following recommendations.

JOE KOCIUBES
Chairman 0fAcademt'c Cabinet

— The foreign language re-
quirement should be shifted to a
program where culture study
would have chief emphasis. The
last term should be changed to
give the student the option of tak-
ing either a fourth unit of the
language or a subject studying
some facet of the nation’s cul-
ture. This change could be en-
acted immediately.

— As long as languages are re-
quired. they should be taught on

a pass-fail system. The reasoning
for this is that many of the in-
structors are inexperienced in
grading“, procedures and that grad-
ing the language puts undue
pressure on freshmen. During the
freshman year the pressure to ob-
tain grades for either scholarships
or just getting off to a good start
is intense. Also, a good portion
of the instructors are inexperi-
enced at teaching. Some students
have their QPA hurt by their in-
eptness to learn languages. The
students with the most difficulty
at languages are usually the ones
who have to take the full 14 cred-
its worth.

—— The cabinet feels that the
language departments should
make some effort to standardize
their teaching and grading meth-
ods.

The cabinet also cited numer-
ous reasons for changes in the
University ROTC program. First,
the program is not legally under
University control. Nor is the
ROTC department under Univer-
sity control. Also, as a training
course for military officers, the
courses place an emphasis upon
military procedure, protocol, and
organizations and not upon “hu-
manistic or political analysis of
military actions.” '

The cabinet also noted that
ROTC courses are the only ones
on campus in which outside
sources are appointing both in-
structors and prescribing official
text material.

Provincialism

One of the most disturbing trends at this University is the
deteriorating out-of-state student ratio. Slowly but surely,
the University is becoming regimented to a provincialism
that can only be detrimental to the otherwise bright future
of this institution. '

Director of Admissions Bernard J. Kobosky said Tues-
day that 2,250 freshman are coming to the University in
the fall. Out of this total. a mere 210 are non-Pennsylvania
residents. This disturbing statistic reveals that slightly less
than 10 per cent of the incoming freshman class will be out-
of state students.

The Pitt News has also learned that in a recent poll 35 per
cent of the student body cited financial reasons as a primary
factor in selecting the University as the school of their choice.
This means that many students may disregard the academic
excellence of this institution as a major factor of selection.
This statistic is the unfortunate result of both the lowered
tuition and the influx of in-state students.

Despite the endless and tiring work of the University Of-
fice of Admissions they nevertheless have failed in their task——
providing the University with a cosmopolitan student body.
But the blame should not be totally placed on Admissions.
There is a great deal of complexity to this problem.

Administrators here share this feeling of despair over the
ever increasing (65 per cent) influx of Western Pennsylvania
students. They cite the recent expansion of the State Uni-
versities in New York and New Jersey as a basis for the de-
teriorating cosmopolitan flux.

The Pitt News maintains that this argument is a by-pro-
duct of a greater problem--the deteriorating image of the Uni-
versity. This institution remains a great center of learning
with an excellent faculty, but it is most difficult to convince

’ a non-Pennsylvania resident of this fact.

We therefore suggest that the University undertake a

.massive public relations campaign to raise the image of the

University to level that it duly deserves. If this project is
implemented why worry about the competing State Univer-
sities in New Jersey or New York?

R.O.T.C.

The Student Government Liberal Arts Cabinet has issued
a number of recommendations concerning academic reform.
One of the recommendations maintains that future R.O.T.C.
courses at the University should be classified as extracur-
ricular activities.

The Pitt News believes that the Cabinet has used sound
reasoning to reach. their conclusion. The R.O.T.C. program is
not under University control. The University has no control
at all over the R.O.T.C. curriculum, and the faculty has no
right to evaluate the performance or academic sophistica-
tion of the R.O.T.C. Department.

Since the R.O.T.C. Department is controlled by Defense
Department directives, the courses offered “place an em-
phasis upon military procedures, protocol, and organizations
and not upon humanistic or political analysis of military act-
ions,” according to the Cabinet.

The cabinet felt that “in a free and open university, such
as Pitt, all courses should be conducted in a spirit of inquiry,
ROTC courses seem to be a blatant exception to this concept
of education.”

This recommendation brings to light a severe controversy.
Should the University subjugate itself to outside control of
any sort? Should the University support Professors of Mili-
tary Science.” who receive academic instructions from Wash-
ington D.C.? Is the University destroying the concept of aca-
demic freedom—a concept on which its reputation stands-—by
permitting the uncontrolled R.O.T.C. program to continue
in its present form‘?

These questions point to a very serious problem at this
University. And The Pitt News believes that the Liberal
Arts Cabinet has the most feasible solution to the‘ ROTC
situation. No student at this University should be faced with
the dire decision of taking ROTC as an alternative to Phys-
cial Education.

The Pitt News demands that ROTC be put in the correct

'perspective—a perspective that reflects the humanistic nature

of academic freedom at this institution.

He was a cab driver. and his name was Atkin-
son. that's all. “just Atkinson.” he said.

And on this day. I was late for work and hurry-
ing. I had planned to be in his cab for only five
minutes.

But just like it happens so many times to me.
Atkinson felt like talking politics. So when he pull-
ed over to the curb to let.
me out he pushed down
the meter handle, planted
his right arm over the top
of the front seat, and look-
ed straight at me.

Now he didn’t know
me; he never met me be-
fore. But he began just the
same.

“Work for the Pitt News
do you?" he asked.

“Yes. I do,” I answered.
“Well you should write

 

something about gun laws. By the way, how do _

you feel about them?” he asked again.

“I’m for them,” I said without really thinking
about the answer.

“Oh no!” he screamed. “Then don’t write any-
thing.”

“I am a sportsman, but do you really want to
know why I’m against this registration of fire-
arms?” he said, as he spit tobacco juice out the

window just in front of an oncoming automobile.
“Here‘s my reasons."

“What would happen if a guy like Wallace be-
came President. Well. I’ll tell ya. He'll get the
FBI. and he'll get the registration list of all the
guns in the country. And then he'll send out the
FBI. and they’ll pickup all the guns. Then hell
have us right where he wants us. That s.what hap-
pened in Germany under Hitler. ’ he explained.

“The whole country would be left defenseless."
he said. after another tobacco spit.

“Now there is an expression I always remem-
ber. Andgl want you to remember it. too.” he said
dramatically.

“This here country was founded by men who
stood with a Bible in one hand and a rifle in the
other. The Supreme Court took the Bible away.
And now the government is trying to take the rifle
away. And what are you left with . . . huh?”

I started to say something. but only got as far
as the “Well I think . . 

“Now listen . . . do you think the criminal is
going to register his gun. Of course, he isn’t. Even
if this law is passed, and I belong to a group that
will really fight it, there will be guns floating
around anyway, just like Prohibition.”

Again I started to say something, but remem-
bering that I would be late for work. I ducked out
the car door when he turned toward the window for
another spit.

As I left, I began to chuckle to myself about
what he said. But then I grasped it as anotherof
those all too common opinions in today’s America.

iB.A.S. Just Another Racist Group

Editor, The Pitt News

In my admittedly limited ex-
perience, and with the exception
of some of the pronouncements
of certain Nazi theorists, I can-
not recall seeing so blatantly ra-
cist a document as that produced
by the Black Action Society. This
is curious, for racism is precisely
what the document explicitly
condemns; yet this is what it
communicates in every para-
graph.

Consider: it proposes the ad-
mission of students—-by skin color,
the establishment of student quo-
tas——by skin color, the nomination
and promotion of faculty mem-
bers—by skin color, the establish-
ment of a new program the staf-
fing of which will be determin-
ed——by skin color, the addition of
professors to existing departments

LITTLE MAN

—by skin color. If the color invol-
ved were white, the authors of
the document would have no dif-
ficulty in identifying lllﬁ £l~‘llSF:
ion involved as “white racism.”
But what the document advocates
is black racism, while seeming
to condemn racism in general.

I submit that there is no such
thing as white or black (or yel-
low or red) racism; there is mer-
ely racism. This is an exceedingly
ugly thing and adjectives
of color do not improve it. It is
a crude form of collectivism: the
mental habit of lumping indi-
viduals into a group because of
certain physical traits.

It is understandable that a min-
ority that has been exploited and
persecuted because of ra c e
would, in self - defense, exhalt
that race and come to consider

it an asset, even to the point of
doing some exploitation in its
turn if the occasion arises. It is
understandable, but not commen-
dable. The victims of a prejudice
ought to learn at least this much
from the experience; not to imi-
tate the attitudes and behavior
of those who have oppressed
them.

Irrationality is irrationality, in-
justice is injustice, by whoever
committed. It is therefore most
regrettable to see the Black Act-
ion Society calling for the very
arrangements that have marked
other racist movements in the
past: quotas for students, a col-
or criterion for appointment of
new faculty, adjustment of uni-
versity courses to conform to a
particular socio—political ide-
ology. ‘

The obsession with race to the
exclusion of individual values is
nowhere so clearly revealed as
in the statement “B1ack profes-
sors in the Departments of Poli-
tical Science, etc. . would
present the Black existence from
the point of view of their respec-
tive fields of study.”

How do we know that these
Black professors would do, or
think, or teach‘? The evident as-
sumption is that their behavior
and viewpoint are predictable;
they are not individuals but sim-
ply Blacks, and all Black think
and act alike.

You cannot fight white racism
with black racism. There is a
single poison, racism, and its an-
tidote is individualism. The only
rational way to judge a man or
woman, or student or professor, is
on his or her own, personal traits
of character and achievement.

If the Black Action Society
seriously wishes to combat rac-
ism. it would do far better to
cease the obsessive harping on
the one note of skin color and
work instead for the recognition
of all persons of promise and
ability, whatever their origin and
background. .

University Chick Is Aware

by BRUCE LEVENSON

Wow! She was good looking
and from New York. Just what
this University needs more of. I
thought.

“What is Pitt like?” she asked
me.

She was one of 550 of our in-
coming freshmen who attended
orientation No. 2 this past Sun-
day through Wednesday.

"What do you like to do?” I
asked.

“Well. I want to get involved.
I want to help people.” She cared.
Groovy. “I think I should do more
for other people. I’ve been too
concerned with myself all my
life.”

And what did she want to do?
“I just want to get involved. May-
be write for the newspaper. may-
be work in the ghetto.”

There will be only 210 non-
Pennsylvania students enrolling
at the University this fall out of

2.250 freshmen. The out-of-state‘

percentage is roughly nine per
cent. Despair not! This is a full
one per cent increase over last
year’s crop of ‘$1.400 tuition peo-
ple.

“This college isn’t exactly Berk-
ley” (What a brilliant statement
I made).

“Don't people care?" she won-
dered.

“Well . . . people don't exactly
get overly concerned about things
around here."

“What do they care about
then?"

She had dark. mysterious fea-
tures —- a bronze tan, sable hair.
Walter Keane eyes - but a bright
disposition. and a sunny smile. a
look of compassion . . .

“Fraternities and sororities . . .
the Pitt student doesn’t get in-
volved in many other extracurri-
cular things." I shrugged while
putting my hands in my pockets.

“Don‘t they care about . . . prob-
lems? About the world?”

“We-ll. there are the parking
meters . . .” I laughed pathetical-
ly, and pulled my sweaty hands
out of my pockets.

Nice hot day, I thought. Oh,
those Walter Keanes!

“Aren’t there more people
around who care?” she hoped.

“Sure there are. Take a good
look around. If you want to find
those around who care, you will,”
Isaged.

Eventually she left me —- for
Fun Night at Trees Hall. But, I
knew I’d see her again.

They radiated and they probed
and they questioned . . . those
eyes, those inquisitive eyes. I
could see them through the crowd

of people.

“I‘m so discouraged.“ she weep-
ed. “I can't believe people at Pitt
are like this." (Neither can I.
baby. and I‘ve been here longer
than you.) “Why didn‘t I go to
NYU?“

That's a good question. I
thought. “Oh. but we need you
here." I blurted out. Please don‘t
leave. my God. I've been looking
for you for so long!

“What happened? I inquired.
trying not to sound alarmed.

“The girls." she sobbed. “Just
talked about the fraternity boys
that they met. And when I start-
ed talking about politics” (she
choked for a second). “One girl
told me that she was voting for
Nixon. because he’s a nice man,
and he was vice-president. . . .
And the boys. the freshmen talk-
ed about fraternities and the fra-
ternity men talked about frater-
nity.”

“Stay here.” I pleaded. “You
care and you’ll do something and
you’ll get something positive out
of your college experience. One
person that cares can make up for.
so many that don't.”

She’s staying.
And she’ll be heard from. We

need her. And more people like
her.

Will more people like her want
to come here?

Science, Engineer Foundation
Established For University

"Governor Shafer is concerned
that so many talented scientists
are leaving Pennsylvania." de-
clared Mrs. Carolyn Gibson.
Board of Education member.Mrs.
Gibson discussed the Brainpower
Program initiated recently by
Shafer in Harrisburg.

“As a result of a two-year study
conducted by the Governor. a
new Harrisburg bureau has been
established by the legislature.“
she continued. “The Science and
Engineering Foundation has been
set up.”

As explained by Mrs. Gibson,
$1.4 million dollars has been al-
located by the state legislature
for research and development
contracts.

The University's cut equalled
five Science and Engineering
contracts totaling $166,520.

Other organizations to receive
sizable grants include Carnegie-
Mellon. $162,000, and the Penn-
sylvania Junior Academy of Sci-
ence, $14,500.

This is where Mrs. Gibson
comes in. As state director of the
Pennsylvania Junior Academy of
Science, she outlined the state’s
efforts to recruit Pennsylvania
high school students interested in
pursuing a career in science.

“The aim of the program is to
locate talented young people in
the state interested in science and
get them some recognition,” the
lady went on.

“Recruitment is being made
through teachers. A series of
Workshops are being planned for
the summer as well as a series of
50 lectures. These lectures are to
encourage high school students
to get foundations and ideas in

science and then to conduct ex-
periments.”

Conscientious students w i 1 1
then present papers on their ex-
periments at meetings of the
Pennyslvania Academy of Sci-
ence.

“There will be no monetary
awards, no competition,” empha-
sized Mrs. Gibson. “The papers
shall be judged only on their in-
dependent quality. There could
be a number of first prizes in all
fields.”

Simon Sez . . .

This program along with the
contract granted to Metallurgical
and Materials Engineering dis-
cussed in a former issue of the
Pitt News, is designed to encour-
age budding scientists to remain
in Pennsylvania. While Mrs. Gib-
son's contract is aimed at students
still in the secondary level of
schooling. the Materials contract
encourages graduate students to
offer their services to the Key-
stone State.

Investigation Reveals Pandora’s Box

by MARC SIMON

After I read about the increase
in tuition for this university’s stu-
dents. I decided to investigate
the administration of this school
to find out exactly why we will
be paying an extra $100.

There was much difficulty in
getting an interview with the ad-
ministrators of the upper eche-
lon. but after I presented my
membership card in Uncle Wes-
ley’s fan club (otherwise known
as a validated ID). one of the
University’s fin e st (complete
with a beer belly) escorted me to
the thirty-second and a half floor
of the Cathedral. It was here
where I saw the wheels of the
University do their exceedingly
fine grinding.

On the thirty-second and a half
floor there are three offices mark-
ed “Butcher,” “Baker,” and “Po—

licy Maker.” Since I had just eat-
en lunch I passed by the first two
offices and went into the spacious
four by eight "Policy Maker" of-
fice. The dust flew as I closed
the door and I couldn’t see any-
one in the murky half-light of the
room. I stood around for a cou-
ple of minutes and was about to
leave when I heard a cackled
voice say. “Sit down. young man.
sit down.”

I couldn’t see who had spoken,
but I sat down anyway. I cleared
my throat to speak, but before I
could the voice croaked, “Well, I
suppose you’re here to inquire

about the raise in tuition. I sup-
pose you want to know what the
extra hundred dollars is for.”

“Yes. that’s right."

“Why you're nothing but an
undergraduate. one of the num-
bers that occupies a spot on our
computer tapes. You can be eras-
ed, you know. What makes you
think you deserve to know?"

“Well,” I said, “I go to school
here. That should count for some-
thing.”

There was a silence for more
than a few moments. I began to
get nervous and was about to
