Montgomery Out In July

by EVAN PATTAK
Feature Editor

The position of Dean of Student
Development, created only last
September is being abolished.

Bernard Kobosky, Vice Chancel-
lor for Student Affairs, said that
Dr. Charles Montgomery, pres-
ent Dean of Student Develop-
ment, would continue at that post
until July 1, when the current fis-
cal year ends. After that date, the
position will not be filled.

- Development   ost

“I’ve asked myself many times,”
he said, “whether the University
needs a Dean of Student Develop-
ment or a Dean of Students. I’ve
done a lot of soul searching on
the matter and I’ve decided

1 against it.”

Friction between Montgomery
and some of his associates and
subordinates also caused Kobosky

 

DR. CHARLES MONTGOMERY

to View the development dean pos-
ition in a new light.

“There were points of aggrava-
tion there,” admitted Kobosky,
“no question about it. I can see a

- lot of frustration.”

University Police
Arrest 2 Students

University Police, this past
weekend, arrested two students
for. drug related violations. The
arrests were made by University
Police Inspector Glenn and the
newly—appointed Assistant In-
spector Charles Brevard.

The first arrest occurred early
Saturday morning in Tower B of
the University Residence Halls.
The student was detained over-
night in Police Station No. 1 and

Aiharraigned for City Court Satur-

day morning.

Chicanos

The second arrest occurred
Saturday afternoon, when Campus
Police took into custody the sec-
ond occupant of the Tower B
room. This student was arraigned
at City Night Court Saturday eve-
ning, and bond was set at $500.

Both students face a prelimin-
ary hearing in_ the first week of
March on charges of violating the
dangerous drug and cosmetic
act. This hearing will determine
whether there is enough evidence
to hold the students for the grand
jury. A

Demand

‘ Union Lettuce

University Chancellor Wesley
W. Posvar promised Chicano stu-
dents Tuesday that he would ad-
vise SAGA Food only to purchase
United Farm Workers Organizing
Committee (UFWOC) lettuce.

CHANCELLOR Posvar views the pe-
titions of the Chicano students as
Executive Assistant Freeman and
“the Chicanos look on. The petitions
contained over 1,900 signatures
supporting UFWOC lettuce. ’

Six Chicano students presented
Posvar and Executive Assistant
to the Chancellor Jack E. Free-
man a list of over 1,900 signa-
tures of students, staff and facul-
ty supporting lettuce picked only
under a UFWOC contract.

Posvar, after viewing the peti- ,

tion, told the students, “I am com-
pletely in sympathy with your
demands, and I will have Dave
Brewer, the'Assistant Vice-Chan-
cellor of Finance, call SAGA
Foods and ask them to either buy
UFWOC lettuce, or not buy any at
all.“

Walter Panzar, a Chicano stu-
dent present at the meeting, told
Posvar and Freeman, “The Let-
tuce Boycott movement is spread-
ing to other schools; it is impor-
tant that we give the UFWOC all
the support available.” Panzar
added that since the University
was such a large “consumer” it
could make a substantial contri-
bution to the movement by buying
only UFWOC lettuce.

After the 20 minute meeting
with the Chancellor was over. Al
Estrada. another Chicano stu-
dent noted. “We did not even
have to read our prepared state-
ment to the Chancellor: all he did
was look at our petitions."

  

Abolished

The office of Dean of Student
Development was created last
September amid a massive reor-
ganization of student affairs. The
purpose of the position was to co-
ordinate some of the services of
Student Affairs and ‘ to provide
one more channel of communica-
tion between students and admin-
istration. Montgomery’s appoint-
ment was announced following an
intense scrutiny of candidates b
a search committee. ’

The departments of Student Ac-
tivities, Special Programs and
the Counseling Service were sub-
ordinated to the Dean of Student
Development. Directors of these
departments were to report di-

rectly to Montgomery, who was W

responsible to Kobosky.

Each of the directors, however,
maintained a separate, autono-
mous budget, and coordination
was sometimes hampered by con-
flicts that arose between Mont-
gomery and the three directors.

Some members of the Student

Affairs staff were reportedly mif-

fed when Montgomery moved his
office from the Student Union to
the 12th floor of the Cathedral,
feeling that this made communi-
cations more difficult. The fifth
floor of the Union houses most of
Student Affairs.

Panel Analyzes Crime Inroad   

by JUDY VOLLMER

U.S. Attorney Richard L. Thorn-
burgh, speaking on “Organized
Crime in Big Business" in a dis-
cussion Monday night, stated,
“Organized crime is big busi-
ness.“ Thornburgh explained,
"The criminal conglomeration in
a year grossed 40 to 50 billion dol-
lars in the marketing .of illegal
goods and services.“

Thornburgh, along with John
Bingler, Pittsburgh Public Safe-
ty Director, and Larry Schmidt,
KDKA newsman, spoke for the
Crime Week Symposium, spon-
sored by the Public Affairs Com-
mittee of the Student Union Board.

“All of these areas are under
study, especially under the Or-

Klavonic Named
To Advisory Council

by BOB BONN

Student Association leader Len-
ny Klavonic has been selected as
one of 15 students from across the
country to serve on a youth advi-
sory council to the Justice De-
partment. »

LENNY KLAVONIC

The committee, chaired by At-
torney General John Mitchell, is
“part of President Nixon’s pro-
posal to develop a better rapport
with youth,” according to Klavon-
1c.

ganized Crime Control Act,” the
attorney added.

The large factory is also influ-
enced by organized crime. Thorn-
burgh said, “Untold thousands of
manpower hours in factories are
diverted to gambling and book-
ing numbers. Organized crime
uses small business people to
push its wares.”

 

RICHARD L THORNBURGH
U.S. Attorney

Public“Safety Director Bingler
spoke about the organized crime
market and its effect on police.
“Organized crime takes advan-
tage of the phenomenon that it's
impossible to enforce criminal
laws that the vast majority of
citizens don‘t heartily support,”
he declared.

Bingler maintained that the
buildup of crimes drives a wedge
between police and the commun-
ity. He added, “Isolation develops

“This will be a place where we
can put our ideals, goals, and
viewpoints against those of the
government,” he continued. The
council will be expected to offer
input on federal legislation from
marijuana laws to campus unrest
to use of force during demonstra-
tions.

Youth advisory boards have
been established with the Defense
Department and the Office of Eco-
nomic Opportunity as well as the
Justice Department, Klavonic
said. “My appointment came
from the Presidents to Presidents
Conference last August that I at-
tended as a student leader.”

At that time, through meetings
with cabinet members in the Nix-
on administration, it was felt by
both sides that the establishing of
a youth committee was a necessi-
ty in achieving understanding of
the phiiosophies and actions of
government, students and citizens.

“What I would like to accom-
plish,” Klavonic indicated, “is to
provide student input in the area
of new legislation affecting indi-
vidual rights, like the no-knock
policy and lessening of marijuana
penalties, where the committee
can provide valuable information.”

The council will meet on a
monthly basis, probably in the of-
fice of the Attorney General.

into a ‘them versus us’ mentality.
The citizens see corruption before
them and lose confidence in po-
lice.” '

Outlining the role of the media
in reporting on crime, Larry
Schmidt stated, “A question that
arises is whether the police are
really fighting the toughest gang
they can locate, or if they’re
working only at the immediate
street level. Are police getting to
the roots of organized crime?”

Schmidt also commented that
the news media in Pittsburgh is
trying to locate and study the
areas where organized crime is
seen in the city, since, said.
Schmidt, “The majority can see
that the mob is here in the city and
nearby, just over the city line. “

by LEE EILS

Realizing that the tremendous
medical needs of the black com-

munity are to be best met by

training more black doctors, the
faculty of the Pitt Medical School

» has begun, in the past two years,

to recruit black medical students
from all over the country. Black

r t , students within the medical school

are concerned, however, about the

apparent lack of interest in medi-

cine on the part of black under-

I . L graduates atPitt.

,The Pitt Medical School has
graduated 10 black men in the
past 15 years (never a woman,

although one has been admitted

to the fall class). The nation’s

‘medical figures do not justify

such an imbalanced condition. As
estimated 6,000 black doctors
serve a black population of 25
million in the United States.

While one white doctor serves
every 700 whites, only one black
doctor is available for every 4,000
to.5,000 blacks. In Pittsburgh,
only two full-time physicians

and School seeks Blacks,Intéirest   

serve the upper Hill’s 24,000 in-
habitants.

‘Robert Thompson, chairman
of the Black Medical Student Al-
Iiance, a sophomore and resident
of Pittsburgh, and Morris Turner,
a sophomore, from Atlanta, Ga.,
reflect a common feeling among
black students within the medical
school. Says Thompson, “We are

concerned about the lack of black ‘

Pitt undergraduates interested in
medicine or related professions.

The medical problem in Pitts-
burgh’s black community demon-
strates the need for more black
medical students. When the Hill
District boasts a doctor-patient
ratio of one to 12,000, the prob-
lem is pressing.

Turner, who was recruited from
Morehouse College in Atlanta,
comments, “Specifically, I would
like to see more interest on the
part of black students in Pitts-
burgh. This is essential to dealing
with the problem." .

actively recruiting. black students

According to Thompson, “We
alsofeel that the school is mak-
ing a sincere effort, although
there may indeed have been pres-
sure in this area."

Neither Thompson nor Turner
could explain the apparent lack of
interest on the part of Pitt’s 700
to 800 black undergraduates.
“Maybe they're being directed
into the social sciences; I don't
know,“ replied Thompson.

The Medical College Admis-
sions Test (MCAT), an entrance
requirement at nearly every
American medical school, is view-
ed by black medical students as
an inaccurate indicator of their
ability to perform in medical
school

In Thompson’s opinion, “The V0-
cabulary and general information
areas of the test are culturally
oriented toward white middle-
class students.” According to
Turner, “The test is used to trip
us before we get off the starting
block.”

Blacks, upon entering medical
school find that the nature of the
problem changes somewhat.
Black medical students at Pitt do
get all academic and most finan-
cial help necessary. but feel that.
within the curriculum. no em-
phasis is placed upon ghetto medi-
cine which the black doctor must
practice.

nr  '_

“We have found the vast ma-
jority of the faculty readily dis-
posable to us,“ admits Thompson.
He does feel. however, that “as
more blacks get into medical
school, there are going to have to
be more programs to take the
school to the community.“

The first two years of medical
school are “preclinical,” involv-
ing the purely scientific study of
medicine, and black medical stu-
dents agree that the “clinical” or
last two years of medical school
should involve more practical
experience.

Says Turner. “There is nothing
in the medical school curriculum
which equips us to handle the
problems of the ghetto. There will
have to be more opportunity for
black medical students to partici-
pate in elective programs in the
black community. The purpose of

“this would be to make medical ed-

ucation relevant to us.

Thompson and Turner also point-
ed out that the medical schools
faculty includes only one black
preclinical member, only one

. black clinical member, and only

four black doctors in affiliation.
Again. the problem stems from
the shortage of black doctors in
the past.

Thompson and Turner empha-
sized three things in their discus-
sion of medical education for
blacks at Pitt.

There is a social responsibility”
involved. “We want to show an
individual‘s social responsibility
to the black community by being
a doctor.”

The Pitt Medical School does
seek black students. “There are

opportunities here at the Univer-

sity of Pittsburgh for blacks to do
medicine.”

The black medical student need
not feel alone at Pitt.t“There is a
black community here at the Pitt
Medical School that he or she can
relate to.”

Twenty-two blacks are current-
ly enrolled in the medical school,
and this number is expected to

grow proportionately in the future(”

Thompson underscored the de-
sire on his part, on the part of the
members of the Black Medical
Student Alliance. and on the part
of the medical school faculty to
attract more black students.

“We are really greatly interest-
ed and would like to be in touch
with any black undergraduates in-
terested in pre-med.” Such help
would include everything from tu-
toring to advising interested black
undergraduates.

The opportunity for black men
and women to study and practice
medicine is available at Pitt. The
interest needs only be shown.

A future article will deal wittfi
the problem of recruiting black
medical students from the fac-
ulty’s standpoint.

Just Why Has Montgomery’s Position Not Been More Developed?

by EVAN PATTAK
Feature Editor

Piled high atop Special Programs
Director Connie Feig’s desk is a moun-
tain of memos from Dr. Charles Mont-
gomery, Dean of Student Development.
Montgomery is Feig’s immediate sup-
erior, and one would expect some sort
of rapport to have developed between
the two. But their contacts have been
swathed in University stationery.

“We never have gotten to know each
other really well,” said Feig of her re-
lationship with Montgomery. “And
when I came to work one morning, he
was gone, moved his office to the Ca-
thedral.”

Chances are that they never will get
to know each other well. Come July 1,
Montgomery will no lpnger be Dean of
Student Development— the position is
being abolished by Bernard Kobosky,
Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs.

Though hailed as a portentous posi-
tion in September, Kobosky now be-
lieves a student development dean sup-

EDITORIAL
The Student Development Office Should -Not

Vice-Chancellor for Student Affairs
Bernard Kobosky is a gentleman. In-
stead of “firing” Charles Montgomery.
the Dean of Student Development, he
has made it impossible for him to serve
after Julyl.

“I don't want to hurt the man,“ Ko-
bosky explained Monday, while admit-
ting Montgomery could have been “a
little more open, flexible, and resilient."
Montgomery himself admitted last month
that he was “not satisfied with what
we’ve accomplished.”

Kobosky’s allegiance to administra-
tive etiquette is obvious. What is less
evident is the depth of his concern for
students.

His sensitive appreciation of Dean
Montgomery’s predicament is laudable,
but at what price chivalry? If a Dean
of Student Development, depending on
the Dean, can serve a useful purpose,
then students are about to be short-
changed. -

As originally conceived. the Dean
of Student Development was to coordin-
ate and supervise the work of the Dir-
ector of Student Activities, the Direc-
tor of Special Programs. and the Direc-
tor of the Counseling Center. His aims
were to involve students in the plan-
ning of Student Affairs projects and to
link Student. Affairs programs more
closely with academic instruction.

When Vice-Chancellor Kobosky cre-

'ated the Dean of Student Development

office last summer, he disregarded pre-
dictions that the post would prove sup-

erfluous. Kobosky is also aware that
Montgomery and his subordinates have
often times pulled in different directions
and that the relations between Montgo-
mery and certain of his colleagues have
not been characterized by warmth and
harmony.

Though dissatisfaction with the man
and his position is obviouslyrife. it
is more difficult to say which came
first or which is more potent.

Connie Feig who along with Direc-
tor of Student Activities Bill Markus
and Director of Information Service
Warren Hill is directly responsible to
Montgomery, feels that the position of
Dean of Student Development is redun-
dant.

“There's just no need for a Dean of
Student Development.“ she said. “its
traditional to have some kind of dean of
students, but they‘re doing away with
them all over the country. The job it-
self is ill—defined."

“What does he do? I suppose his job
is to discipline and to provide creative

erflous. Now, he has made an about-
face.

It is not clear whether Kobosky was
wrong last summer or is wrong now. But
Charles Montgomery’s term as Dean
of Student Development is too clouded
by other factors for reliable assessment
to be made on the basis of the past
six months alone.

Neither Vice-Chancellor Kobosky
nor the various Student Affairs Direc-
tors blame Montgomery for the Dean of
Student Deve1opment’s lack of success
over the past six months.

 

Dean Montgomery, left, with Vice
Chancellor's Aid Gary Houston.

Dean Montgomery’s decision to sep-
arate himself from those he was sup-
posed to supervise (because of conges-
tion on the fifth floor of the Student
Union) undoubtedly aggrevated a deli-
cate situation. The shift. however. was
justifiable, if imprudent.

Space will soon be available in the
Student Union, as the Counselor Educa-

leadership. but we get leadership from
students and other sources and the
concept of discipline is passe.“

Yet it was only this past summer

when Connie Feig and other responsi- .

bile administrators, faculty, and stu-
dents formed a search committee to fill
what was then considered the crucial
post of Dean of Student Development.
Why is a position that was deemed ne-
cessary then so easily written off now?

Feig admits disenchantment with
Montgomery. His style seems to be ultra
impersonal. Most of his communica.
tions are formal and written. the major
exception being a weekly two-hour staff
meeting. He and his associates are. of-
ten only vaguely aware of what the
other is doing.

Perhaps the most‘ telling incident
was Montgomery’s decision to move
his office from the fifth floor of the
Union, where most of the Student
Affairs staff is, to the twelfth floor of
the Cathedral. This action was viewed
as symbolic and symptomatic of Mont-

tion Department moves to the Cathe-
dral. And a Dean of Student Develop-
ment situated in the Student Union is
likely to function more effectively.

But there is another complication
which Kobosky cites in explaining his
decision to abolish the Dean of Student
Development. He claims that friction is
ingrained in the structure Student Af-
fairs chose a half year ago.‘

Konnilyn Feig, Bill Markus. and
Warren Hill — Student Affairs Direc-
tors -— have separate budgets and thus
financial autonomy. That Dean Mont-
gomery has found this arrangement frus-
trating is understandable. At times. he
must have felt like Laurence Peters
“free-floating apex“ with “nothing to
do and nobody to supervise."

However, the same structure exists
elsewhere and without the allegedly in-
stitutionalized friction. Robert New-
comb of Admissions and Charles Dees
of Student" Aid have separate budgets.
Like Montgomery, Ken Wenger, the
Dean of Admissions and Student Aid,
has no financial control over his subor-
dinates.

Because the same problems have not
arisen in Admissions and Student Aid.
it would seem that the fault lies not
with structure but with personalities.

In short. if Charles Montgomery can-
not be blamed for failing to inject an
elixir into the bloodstream of Student
Affairs, neither can the position he
has held be termed superfluous or un-
wieldy.

gomery’s voluntary seclusion within the
department.

“I have a sense that he‘s not relax-
ed." said Feig. "Perhaps his lack of
familiarity with the ways of a large.
urban University is a factor. "Montgom-
ery‘s prior experience is predomin-
antly with schools smaller than Pitt.

Feig can see no way to salvage the
office. nor would she like to.

“It‘s an impossible job. I doubt that
the most competent administrator could
have handled it adequately. I believe
that the creation of the position was an
earnest and sincere attempt to bring
order to Student Affairs. But it just
hasn‘t worked and there’s no reason to
continue it."

Feig stressed that none of her dis-
agreements with Montgomery were per-
sonal.

“I feel frustration rather than any
hostility." she said. As she spoke. she
flung an arm toward the Cathedral.

“It's just that he‘s over there."

Be Aboﬁshed

The Pitt News thinks the Vice-
Chancellor’s decision to ease Charles
Montgomery out of his present position
as gracefully as possible was a wise
one and no reflection on Dr. Mont-
gomery.

Dean Montgomery has time and
again demonstrated his concern. His dil-
igence, and his talent. In Kobosky‘s
words, he is "deep, sensitive, and
okay." Moreover. he has been victim-
ized by some problems beyond his con-
trol -— the Student Union space situation,
for example, and the inevitable diffi-*;
culty of coping with a brand new posi-
tion.

By the same token. though. it would
be unfortunate if the Dean of Student
Development's office were summarily
abolished. Students can profit from hav-
ing one more person to facilitate and
coordinate - to spend time overviewing
Student Affairs which the busy Vice-
Chancellor for Student Affairs simply
cannot afford.

The Pitt News suggests that the p? .

sition of Dean of Student Development
be vacated as of July 1, but we urge
Vice-Chancellor Kobosky ' to reappoint
a Dean of Student Development Search
Committee. V

In conjunction with a special com-
mittee to probe the concept of Student
Development, it should be able to de-
cide whether a new Dean of Student
Development should be appointed by
September 1.

Hard Narcotics at Pitt

by BOB GING

To use a perennial cliche, the heat is on. This past weekend the Campus Police
arrested two students in the Towers for drug related charges. Many students were
shocked by the fact that the Campus Police were involved, in a drug bust. and by
the fact that the drug bust was in the dorms. ‘

The shock is understandable if one considers two of the beliefs held by many
students on this campus. The first fallacy of many concerning campus students is
that the dormitory complex at the University is a sanctuary from normal law enforce-
ment agencies. This is not true. Any law enforcement agency, with the proper war-
rants, may and will come on this campus at any time.

The notion that the University is a sanctuary has caused an influx of hard drugs,
narcotics and such, into the University community. This problem is getting worse, and
the attention of off-campus law enforcement officials are being focused on Pitt.

This leads us to the rationale and reasoning behind the second excuse for shock.
Why did the campus police make the bust?

The Police at this University have the duty and obligation to protect the stu-
dents, and this IS the main reason for their involvement. The campus police are
aware of. and are becoming increasingly concerned about the influx of hard drugs
onto this campus, and it is their responsibility to stop them.

Some students may ask, how is making a bust protecting us. Few people can ar-
gue that the man who’s pushing the heroin, the morphine,. the dilaudid and other
drugs of this nature are doing so in the interest of the community.

The hard core narcotics pusher is either doing so because he must support his hab-
it, or because the organization he isfworking for is paying him quite a bundle to
take the risks.

Not A Police Problem

In either case. he is out for his own good. and the only way he can be succesﬂ)
ful is by getting others hooked. you and me, or maybe some of our brothers, it doesn't
matter who it is’ to the pusher.

Hard drugs, narcotics, are one of the greatest dangers which our community
faces. If you're a freak. or you're black, you probably know that everything your
movements are trying to accomplish, can easily be destroyed by hard drugs.

Come down on the campus police as hard as you like, but they are acting in the
good interest of the community. Many people will be hard in their indictment of
the campus police, but I would be inclined to believe that a bust made by the cam-
pus cops is far more preferable than a bust by city, state or federal narcotics agents,
whose only job is to bust people.

So, back to what’s going on. ‘ The campus police have “made one drug bust on
campus this year (student drug bust). It was the first and whether or not it will be
their last, remains to be seen. If for some reason, hard drugs and their suppliers
were suddenly to disappear from the campus, I would suspect that the campus pol-
ice would probably not be making any busts in the near future.

If, however, hard drugs remain on campus and increases in their exposure to the
student population continue, it would be almost inevitable that some of the small
people, the casual marijuana user, the finals week amphetamine users. and others
who are far from hardened criminals, will find themselves behind the same bars
as the narcotics pusher. I

/
Hard narcotics at Pitt are not a police problem, they are a community problem.
When people are getting hooked, they are our people. When the heat is on, it is on
us, not the police. It’s your problem, so what are you going to do?

Oakland set

For overhaul

To the Editor; The Pitt News;

How many of you remember
the last time Forbes Avenue was
closed due to major repairs re-
sulting in a “casket parade” by
the merchants? It could happen
again this year. Both Forbes and
Fifth Avenues are to be resur-
faced soon.

The city and state also intend
to exchange responsibilities of
these two major arteries because
of the connection planned for the
new Brady Street bridge.

Come and hear Colonel Bert
De Melker, Director of the City
Department of Public Works
talk about these major repairs
and help us get a written element
of time performance by the con-
tractor including the starting and
completion dates made a part of
the contract.

Let us hear. Robert Paternos-
ter, Director of the City Plan-
ning Department explain exactly
what they intend to do with
Bates Street. Oakland Avenue
and when they will make both
Forbes and Fifth Avenues one-
way streets.

Finally Anthony J. Gaeta, Dis-
trict Engineer of the Pennsyl-
vania Department of Transpor-
tation will confirm\ their plans

regarding their portion of Bates
Street below the Boulevard of

the Allies, the Oakland Cross-
town Forbes Avenue and Fifth
Avenue.

A meeting has been set for to-
day at Gustine’s, 2 p.m. and it is
open to the public. Further in-
formation will be forthcoming
on the slated changes.

Sincerely.

John Katsur, Jr.
Executive Director

The 142 Bouts

by MIKE MILLER

  

.When the fates first frowned upon the Pitt wrestling team,
-he» 142 pound class was the first to feel the blows of injuries
and bizarre circumstances and they never seemed to end. But
despite the misfortunes, the 142 pound wrestlers have man-
aged to provide the most interesting and exciting bouts at each
match this year.

73 Each of the four wrestlers who have filled the posi-
tion ‘have been ableto provide dramatic come-from-behind
victories, upsets and tight wins. I

‘Bud Smeltz won bouts by a narrow margin, and once
against Michigan, he pinned his opponent in the final sec-
n.d_s11of the match while trailing 11-3.

John"B.uzzatto has kept fans
“n the edge of their seats

matches which were ultimate-

Tonight‘s game also marks the
last time Pitt and Westminster
play a home-away series in a
season, limiting their yearly com-
petition to one game per cam-
paign’.

“They requested the change."
commented Pitt coach Buzz Ridl.
"And we were considering it at
the time. Now we only play
Penn State and West Virginia
twice a season. We should really
play Syracuse twice too, to round
out the Big Four."

Since the Cats and Titans
battled last, each team has. play-
ed two games each, adding a
pair of wins. Pitt has beaten
Lafayette» _ at home (88-72),
and Carnegie-Mellon (104-59),
while the Titans have jacked
their season’s record up to
12-9.

..“I saw them play last Satur-
day," said Ridl about the Titans.
“They beat Susquehanna and
looked impressive. They beat St.
Vincent the Wednesday before
that and those are the only games
they’ve played since we beat
them.”

Less than two weeks ago. the
Panthers traveled to New Wil-

will carry the contest locally.
The game begins at 2 :30 p.m.

usts To Bench

_ers on the squad, his distinct

lack of height (he measures
5-10) hinders his defense and
overall play.

“It’s a combination of my size
and my defensive play that”s
keeping me from playing." he
commented. "It would be fool-
ish to keep Kent on the bench
and Bill is a real good defen-
sive player that fires up the
team."

Caldwell has the unusual
nickname of Chopper‘ for a man
of his small stature. Ironically.
thename was given to him as
a result of his predecessor. Bob
Caldwell.

“He played here the year I
came and he was known by

- that nickname and because we

had the same names, everyone
started calling me it also.”

Ridl is high in praise for his
senior guard. “His adjustmentin
the past two years has been more
than a coach can expect." he
said. ‘_’I’m.sure he's been dis-

appointed that he hasn‘t played

much but hehas been very good
aboutit.“  _  ‘ m «. -

The Pitt News

Sports

Pitt's Buzzy Harrison (foreground) appears airborn against Mountaineers.

With the Panthers pouring in

10 points early in the second,

half, Westminster was forced

to run with the Cats and slowly

fell behind. The difference in
height provided too much
board strength to contend with,
in addition to some timely shoot-
ing by the Panthers.

When asked whether he
thought Westminster would again
try to slow the game down Ridl
replied, 4“I doubt it. Had they
been more successful they‘d
probably try it again. I kind of
suspect that they'll shoot more,
though. They have a good of-
fense, and they’ll probably cut
their holding onto the ball so
much.“

Ridl, who coached Westmin-
ster 12 years, is familiar with
the school and the type of bas-
ketball played there. Many of
the ballplayers who are playing
now were recruited by and were
playing while Ridl was still with
the Titans.

“They've changed
fense a bit,” indicated Ridl,
“Because of the new coach, but

  

IKE CALDWELL
Career nears end

‘Chopper‘ doesn't regret his
coming to Pitt even though he
hasn‘t played a lot. “It was nice
to play as a sophomore and I

their of-,

 

    

 
 

they have a lot of the same play-
ers, so much of the offense is
similar to when I coached.”

Gary Brown and Randy Huey.
two of Westminster's top scorers
were recruited by Ridl. Ridl
calls Brown, “an outstanding
player who always does well
against us, and Huey is a very
good shooter. ’ '~

Following tonihgt's final
home game the Panthers take to
the road for a three game stint
on foreign courts.

Penn State, West Virginia and
Georgia Tech round out the
Cats’ 24, game schedule. They
stand 13-7 to date and have won
their last two contests.

Commenting on whether it’s
undesirable to finish on the road

Ridl said, “No I don’t think so.‘

It’s as good a way as any to
finish the season. If you’ve had
any momentum built up it
might ‘be good to carry it on
the road at the end. We’ll fin-
ish pretty much the same way
next year, too.”

Kent Scott continues to lead
the Panthers .with over 15
points a game, followed by Paul
O‘Gorek, Mike Paul (who is
out for the season) and Buzzy
Harrison. Most of the Pan-
thers have seen considerable
playing time lately. expecially
in the last game against C-MU.

Tonight will be the last game
in the Field House for Billy.
Downs, Mike Riggle and Mike
Caldwell. All three are seniors.

Cubs Host
Little Titans

The Cubs will meet the West-.
minister Little Titans for the
second time this season in a pre-
liminary basketball game tonight
at the Field House.

Two weeks ago. the freshman
team whipped the Titan frosh
77-57 on" the Westminster home
court. A

Like the varsity. this will be
the final home game of the year
for the Cubs. They have only two
games left on their schedule.

Presently. the Cubs have strung
six victories in a row and have a
overall record of 10-4.

Oppose Carlow Today  

~ Top Player
Possibly Out
With Injury

Today at 4:30 p.m. in Trees Hall
Gym, Pitt’s women’s hoopsters
will host Carlow College.

In last year’s meeting of the
two teams, Pitt trounced their op-
ponents, whipping them by an ex-
cess of 30 points.

“I think it will be fairly easy to
beat Carlow," said Pitt’s coach,
Sandra Bullman. “I'm expecting
a game like Robert Morris.“

. Pitt hopes to drop Carlow from
the season schedule next year. “I'-
hope this will be the last year we
play Carlow and Robert Morris,”
stated Coach Bullman. “They are
just not in the same class as Pitt.
The girls don’t look forward to
playing these kind to teams.”

“We may even drop Carnegie-
Mellon from our schedule if they
don’t show some improvement. If
traveling expenses permit, I‘d

Dorm Intramural Wrestling

Shows Balance This Year

Intramural dorm wrestling is almost history, and
only one dorm house appears likely to win more
than one title.

That house is Mad House. Mad has one cham-
pion in the competition as of Monday, Bob Hull,
who pinned Ed Everett of Pleasure Palace in 3:52
of their championship match.

Mad will send a grappler, Trimmer, against
Stratford’s Joe Spicko in a heavyweight bout

yesterday (after Pitt News deadline). 

Besides the heavyweight division there are two
others without champions. There was no 120-
pound title bout, and there were still numerous
candidates in the 190-pound weight.

Pins were predominant in the title action that
has been completed. 1

Besides Hull’s pin for Mad in the 130—pound
competition, honors were grabbed via the fall at
160, 170, and 180. '

The 160-pound winner was Craig Evans of
Pleasure Palace. Evans stopped Mad’s Preidis at
3:17 into their bout.

Kevin Love, who will be eligible’ to wrestle
for the Pitt varsity next year, won at 170, pinning

another Mad wrestler, Jay Friedberg at 3:20. Love
was representing Bud House in the tourney.

The final pin of the competition finals followed
in the 180-pound match. O’Quinn of the House
of the Midnight Hour forced Stratford’s Nevin
Rider’s back to the mat-in the quickest pin of the
finals. The win came after 1:58 had elapsed in
their match.

Two other pairings during the finals werenot
decided by pins.

At 150, Keith Cleland of Sutherland blanked

Terry Sadler of Random, 8-0.

At 140, Ruben Stew needed two wins to gain
the title. Both victories came with relative ease to
Keystone’s only title holder. He bested Rutsky of
Sutherland, 13-5, and then toppled Bud House's
Strayer, 10-3.

Even if Mad House doesn’t win a second
championship in the heavyweight bout——and
that’s highly possible since the heavyweight op-
position, Spicko, was’a champion last year-Mad
will still show the top performances in tourney.
Mad will have at least four competitors finishing
either first or second.

CE ’s Reverse Outcom,

Of Protested Game

/In a replay of a game played earlier this season, protestedby th
Civil Engineers, the CE’s edged the Industrial Engineers, 49-:4

Friday.

The CE’s are now resting atop the Engineering League with an 
blemished 5-0 record. They had originally lost the game, butgther
versed decision keeps them undefeated with a chance of finishin‘g,th

season at 6-0.

Resuming the contest late in
the second half, the Civil Engi-
neers drew first blood. Frank Li-
kart was fouled with the score
resting at 46-46, the point at which
the original game went awry. Li-
kar converted one of two shots
from the charity strip in and one-
and-one situation. ,

The IE’s failed to score as they
attempted a fast break only to
have CE’s Mike Ring come back
with the ball and lay it up for a
field goal that iced the game.

The lost switched the Industrial
Engineers’ record from 4-1 to 3-2.
Part of the IE’s troubles center
around the fact that their high
scorer Culley was not available
for competition.
