Compulsory Chapel Wins

There is one questioiriwhich is per- ”

vading the atmosphere of the Pitt
Farm. It is daily becoming‘ evident
that some settlement about the Chapel"
question must be made ‘as soon as pos-
sible. The Pitt Weekly intends to do
all that is possible to’ get the best so-
lution of. this problem. We believe

that if the faculty and students ex-i

press themselves about it, a general
opinion of all will come about. This
general opinion should be the means
of solving the Chapel question. Our
reporter‘ has ‘asked opinions from
many men of the school, both faculty
and students,.and we will print as
many as we can. M 4 .

As Chancellor McCormick
said so emphatically in.
el one morning, /‘Something must be
done in regard to Chapel.”.We must
have either no Chapel at‘ all, or ,a full
attendance at Chapel.” Many of the

(faculty were unwilling to express

themselves about this question, which
they consider far too important to
make a passing opinion about. Profes-
sor Gibbs, who takes charge of our
chapel speakers at present and is vi-
tally concerned, said"‘I do not believe
in compulsory chapel as long as it is
a religious service. Butl would ad-
vocate two optional and one compul-
sory chapel services each week, if this
one would not be a strictly ‘religious
service as at present.” Likewise Dean
Bishop of the Engineers said, “One of
the three‘ chapel periods should be
compulsory.” If we can but get the
student bory together, they will want
to meet together often.”
Our Registrar, Dr.
told the -reporter, “I

Frost
am get-

ting to believe in one compulsory per-,

iod though there are many objections,
namely, the present chapel will hold
only half of our students. But we must
all get together.” Dr. Ullman expressed
a somewhat different view as follows:
“Chapel is entirely a student question;
it is for the students and they should
solve their own problems. I would
say that if the chapel were crowded,
the faculty should give up their places
to the students.” Dr White said, “The
solution ‘is not compulsory chapel, but
interesting chapel.”

Among the students, Arch-
er, president of the S t u d e n t
Senate said, “I would like to see one
period compulsory and two optional.
We should try it, anyhow.” B._F. Ashe,
a member of the Athletic Committee

Pitt Men Honored

Professors and Graduates on interna-

tional Chemistry Committees.

The University of Pittsburgh has
secured international recognition of

‘the excelleﬁcy of its Chemistry cours-
'es.

Several-of its professors and grad-
uates have been appointed to serve on
the most important committees of the
Ninth International Congress of Ap-

plied Chemistry, to be held in VVash-j _ .
Wooster, University of Pittsburgh, and

ington, D. 'C., and New York City,
September 4-to 13, 1912." Congress,
at the request of over 4,00 American
chemists, authorized President Taft
to invite this body of chemists to hold
its next congress in the United-States.
The offer was presented by Whitelaw
Reid and unanimously accepted. Pres-
ident Taft will preside at the open-
ing meetings in Washington on Sep-
tember 4, 1912.‘ He has shown his so-
licitude for the success of the confer-
ence by causing invitations to be sent
to all the governments of the world to
take partin the deliberation. _

Dr. Francis S. Phillips, Professor of
Chemistry in the University has been

highly honored. He has been selected ‘

as one of a committee of ﬁve nation-
authorities on “analytical chemistry."
Dr. Phillips, who is now serving his
thirty-ﬁfth year as a member of the
university faculty, is an international
authority on gas analysis.

Professor Alexander Silverman, as-
sistant professor of chemistry, has
been appointed a member of the com-
mittee on the “silicate industries of
the United States.” For a number of
years he was chemist for the Mac-
beth-Evans Glass Company, and since
his connection with the University of
Pittsburgh has acquired considerable
reputation for his researches in glass
manufacturer and as a consulting
chemist. 9

J. M. Camp, ’80, whose methods of
analysis of iron and steel developed
for the United States Steel Corpora-
tion are now recognized as standard

Ohio Wesleyan Wins4Pitt llllan Does‘

Well. .

Prof_ Fulton Gives F_leadings—‘Excel-
lent Musical Program by Miss Ruth-
erford and Mr. Wettach._

Before the largest audience that has
ever attended‘ the Orotorical Contests
at the University of Pittsburgh, there
took place last Friday evening the an-
nual Intercollegiate Oratorical .Con-
test of Ohio lWesleyan University of

Allegheny College. The contestants
_of the different institutions were, re-,
spectively, Frank J. Cartwright, ’11,
Edward A. Hirschman-, X11, Raymond
L. Archer, ’11, and Charles E. -Vogel.
The gathering was a representative
one, being composed of alumni, facul-
ty, and students of each of the contest-
ing schools. A more appreciative and
interested audience could not be found.
A remarkable feature of the evening
was .the songs and cheers given by the
Ohio Wesleyan alumni, who turned out
in force tozsee their man win.

Miss Rutherford furnished music be-7
fore and afterthe contest and cap-
tured the hearts of the audience by

her sweet rendition of the old time‘

songs.. Prof. \Vittach of Allegheny
performed several times on the piano;
His excellent solos were much appre
ciated. Prof_ Fulton of Ohio Wesley?
an University gave two exceptionally
ﬁne _readings which pleased the au-

dience immensly. Prof. Fulton "is one A
' of the past masters of the art of public

speaking in America, being at-__th,e
head of the school of oratory at Ohio
Wesleyan. 7 -

All those who listened to the ora-
tions were well paid. The contest
was close. No one was able to guess
who had won until the judges decision
was given, awarding ﬁrst place to
Ohio Wesleyan. The subjects were all
of a practical character on interesting
and important questions of the day,

The orators showed complete masteery 9

of their subjects. They showed no
hesitation. Their arguments were
well arranged, lucid, and forcible and
were Qlearly presented. The speakers
were at ease on the platform showing
training and practice The work of
the evening was a striking evidence
of the great attention which is now be-
ing paid to public speaking in the
work of the colleges The orations
given were representative of a new
type of public speaking. There was no
ﬂorid sentimental style seeking mere-
ly for oratorical effect. The orations

GREET-I NGS;

 

The new-Pitt Weekly Board‘ extends

- gneoti-ngsto the students, faculty, and

alumni‘: of. the University of" Pitts-
’bunghi‘n' this, its ﬁrst issue. The out-
going staff‘ takes with it the heartiest
congratulations of‘ the _whole student
body. Substituting 3. modern college
newspaper for the former. monthly
literary journal, the board of 1910-11
has; been wonderfully successful. Al-
though handicapped by the many ob-

,_stacles attending every new venture,

the Pitt Weekly during the last school
year has steadily advanced until now

'itt,stands in the ﬁrst rank of ‘college

pu-b1ic~ation_s. Too much praise cannot
be given the members of the retiring
board for their able and conscientious

work.

We appreciate the “glad hand” ex-
tended to us by our predecessors.
While all the members of the editorial
staff‘ are novices and may lapse from
the high standards set by the preceed-
perienced ,kzs21iya: silqYitso etaoetat
ing board, yet we trust that our ong
suxffering readers will indulgently bear
with our inexperience. '

But to make this paper successful,
it=‘is absolutely necessary that every
member of the student body and of the

_ faculty co-operate with us in securing

the news and expressing the senti-
ments and wishes of our subscribers.
-Let us have the co-operative system
.i'n~the -Pitt.W'eekly. Remember it is
your ‘paper; it is your representative,
and act accordingly. When you hear
‘a’-piece of news, turn it in. With such
a-‘spirit behind it, the paper cannot
fail to be a success.

THE COMING YEAR_

Remember that the new schooluyear
is ‘coming rapidly around. And with
it comes the new Freshman class.

‘ Howlarge this class will be, depends
‘to a. great degree upon the student

body. Let every undergraduate pledge
himself to secure one or more student
fo‘r.:Pitt. What a class we should have
next year! It would be an immense
stride toward that 2000 mark. If the
students are to do this it must be done

-immediately. High and preparatory
schools will soon be dismissed, and
their students scattered for the sum-
mer. ‘ We must get these students be-

 fore they leave school. The Senate‘ has

been accomplishing a great deal to-
‘wards securing new" men through its
reception tofthe preparatories. With
this start is should‘ not be hard" for
a loyal Pitt man to persuade the fel-
lows in his own town to come here.
Tell them about our football team‘, our
large faculty of two hundred and‘ tewn-
ty-ﬂvee mmbers, and our new build-
ings. Boost Pitt, ﬁrst, last and all the
time. That is the spirit that wins. It
is the sprt we need’ here. When each
man becomes a special advertiser for
Pitt, on the lookout for new students,
then we shall have the real Pitt spirit
—and the students. too. We hope,
therefore, that every man will seize
this opportunity to. work for his Alma
Mater;

ORBATORICAL coN'rEs'T.

 

In the words‘ of a prominent mem-
ber of our faculty, the Oratorical Con-
test was a “huge success.” The arrang-
ments for the mechaical details of the
contest were completed’ without a
hitch. The hall was~artistica;lly dec-
orated and an attractive program‘. was
arranged. The preparations made by
the students in charge of the event
were the best that have ever’ been
made at this school for like events.
The large crowd of students and fac-
ultypresent showed a pleasing atti-
tude toward this brancl; of inter-col-
legiate activity. The whole evening
showed that there is taking place in
this school a great advance along the
lines of inter-collegiate debating and
oratory. We might congratulate our-
selves upon the great interest which
was displayed in the excellent orations
delivered by the representatives of the
four competing colleges.

There was but one drawback to the
success of the evening—Pitt did not
win. But even from this disappoint-
ment we can draw consolation and
also inspiration _for next year. Our
man did his‘ best. He showed a mas-
tery bf subject, self—possession and
earnestness which should have won.
But he was handicapped by certain
conditions which he was powerless to
avert. It would be -useless to speak
of these handicaps, if they could not
be remedied. But it is not only pos--
sible to remedy them; they can be com
handicaps? In the ﬁrst place, we have

to public speaking. VVe need more

whole student body. This is being
rapidly remedied through the ad-
vanced - courses recently ‘established.
Yet classes alone will not remove this
defect in our system of public speak-
ing. We need more practice in actual
speaking such as can be secured in
cvollege in only one way—-in the clubs
and societes of the school. In the
second place, we have not suﬂicient

senting the school in our oratorical

not have this year. Another year let .

us start contests for the position of
Pitt’s oratorical representative. Let
these contests be started early in the
Then we will have a course of
training which will undoubtedly pro‘-
duce a winning orator.

’1"h‘e‘re yet remains one thing need-
ful. We must have more school spirit.
Every. student must back our repre-
sentative. When each man turns in
to work for Pitt, then will we win

from those other schools in which col’-

up our minds to win the next contest_
If we do determine to win, We will. We
need more school loyalty. And this
spirit is coming. Never before were
so many students, present at a liter-
ary contest. Next year let us make
it still better. We need inter-class
contests which will bring out the best
for the winners. But above all, we
need the support of every man in the
school. A

DOCTOR DUNCAN MAKES .
ADDRESS

Women" Learn‘ How Gems Become‘
Cheap.

 

In a lecture before the Woman's
Club * of Pittsburgh last Tuesday at
McCreery’s', Prof. Robert Kennedy
Duncan, of the department ‘of indus-
trial research, explained the mysteries
of modern science. He told how the
rarest of gems may become the most
common and cheapest of wares and
how great industries may be shattered
by the discoveries brought about by
modern scientiﬁc investigation. He
spoke of the’ many wonders worked
by the discoveroes of scientists, of -the
making of the ﬁnest perfumes from
coal tar, of the discovery of the man-
ufacture of indigo which ruined the
trade of the indigo barons, and of the
recent discovery of the secret of mak-
ing rubber. The department of indus-

trial research is a new one in co-ope-

ration with the industrial plants of the
city. _

“Many important discoveries have
been made in these departments and,
in fact, we have never made a failure,”
said Doctor Duncan. A special task
given to the department in the city is
the solving of the problem of the
smoke nuisance, for which a contribu-
tion. of eleven thousand dollars has
been made.

ORATORlCAL ASSOCIATION.

Friday afternoon the Oratorical As-
sociation comprising Ohio Wesleyan,
Wooster, Allegheny and Pittsburgh,
met in executive session. The -whole
afternoon was devoted to considering
the adoption of a new constitution.
Finally, Professor Fish, of Pitt was

elected chairman of a committee to’ A

draft a new constitution for the As-
sociation. The question oflnew col-
leges was discussed. It was voted to
hold the next inter-collegiate. oratori-
cal contest at Wooster. E

Editor Pitt'Wee'k1y:’——1n spite of the
fact that the students failed‘; to fulﬁll
their obligations in connection with

The appeal to students for help in
the decoration of the chapel for the

hour or so before the time of the con-
test, a hurried search for materials
enabled the University students to
soften the harsh appearance of the
bare walls oflthe room where the con-
test was held. The representatives
of other schools have been accus-
"'ton‘1ed to speak‘ in ﬁnely_ 'furnis-hed

would rather be in the school room.

The writer recently had a conver-
sation with the student in question
who said that the wrong impression
had been gained by the editor. He stat-
ed that although it was harder work
than school he realized it was just the
thing the students needed to ﬁt them

THE PITT

12,000‘ CHILD R E~N P LAY.

The Festival of the Pittsburgh School
Children in Schenley Park a Succes

Yesterday afternoon under the aus-
pices of the Playground Association,
12,000 Pittsburgh children took part
in a big festival of play in Schenley
Park and Forbes Field. To say that
they made merry on the beautiful
greens of Schenley Park does not ex-
press it. They’ shouted and laughed
as they romped over the green sward,
not unlike the lambs when they get
out for the first time in spring. From
one o'clock to four, the 12,000 children
played and danced and performed
drills. Then, headed by Nirella’s
band, not unfamiliar to Pitt students,
they all marched to Forbes Field.
The festival ended here with the fa-
mous Pied Piper of rHamlin drill in
which 500 of the playground children
participated. It was a great day for
the children. The festival this year

' even excelled the one held two years

ago during the convention of the Play-
ground Association in this city, when
10,000 children played and danced on
the many playgrounds laid out in
Schenley Park.

One impression comes to all who at-
tended the festival or even stopped to
think about it. Pittsburgh, with the
parks and pleasure grounds offers pos-
sibilities for usefulness almost unde-
veloped at present. Our parks should
not be mere places of beauty to please
the aesthetic sense in us, but rather
places where old and young could
meet foritheir bodily health. These
children need health and bodily de-
velopment most of all and then the
aesthetic and beautiful will naturally
grow up in them. Our parks must be
useful ﬁrst. Cleveland's parks are
well worthy of imitation. They con-
tain forty baseball diamonds, every
one of which is in useon summer af-
ternoons and holidays. In these parks

are 20 public playgrounds besides ten-

nis courts and the playgrounds around
the schools. Pittsburgh must do
something to get her schoolchildren
away from the reeking ﬁlthy streets
tosmother earth. They must be giv-
en a. chance in life by having good
health and a place to play, for “play
is the healthiest exercise.” Great
credit is ‘due to the Association. in

’its attempt to develope the resources

of our parks and give everybody the
chance for healthful recreation. Dr.
White, the head of the Psychology
department, is one of the leaders in
this movement for the welfare of the
children. He holds the oﬂicial posi-
tion of lecturer for the Playgrounds
Association.

Classical Association of Western
Pennsylvania Meets at W. & J.—in-
terestlnggProgram Rendered.

 

At the meeting ofthe Classical As-
sociation at Washington and Jefferson
college on April 29, Dr. B. L. Ullman,
rofessor of Latin in the University of

- Pittsburgh, was elected president for

the ensuling year.
to be chosen as head of this organiza-
tion, since it has as its members the
best rclassican scholars and teachers
of all Western Pennsylvania- In the
work of the Association the members
of the University take a prominent
part. «At the last meeting, Pitt was
represented by Dr. and Mrs. Frost.
Prof. and Mrs. Fetterman, Dean Frie-
sell of the Dental School, Prof. Scrib-
ner and Dr. Ullman.

The program was of great interest
and importance, consisting of a paper
on “Perspective in Classical Study and
Teaching,” by Prof Chas. E. Bennett,
of Cornell University. A noved feat-
ure in the shape of Greek music ren-
dered in the original by Prof. Wells’
of the chemistry department of W. &
J. and an illustrated lecture on the
Olympic games by Prof Allen of W.
& J. ‘After the program a very pleas-
ant reception was heldin honor of the
visiting ' members.

PRESIDENTS’ CONFERENCE

Mr. Boggs, the newly elected presi-
dent of the Y. M. C. A‘, attended the
Y. M. C. A. Presidents’ Conference at
Allegheny College, Meadeville, Pa.
The presidents of college Y. M. C. A’s.
from many states were present. The

that, by comparing the condition of
other Y. M. C. A. with our own, he
began to realize the work that we will
have to do to catch up.

GOVERNMENT RECOGNIZES
 ENGINEERS
Pitt Placed First Amo,ng_Engrne'erin,
Schools.

 

In the recent government report up-—
on education, Pitt holds the most im-
portant place. A long review of the
co-operative system is made the sub-
ject of comment by the government
evperts. Upon every side this innova-
tion has been receiving attention, un-
til our national government has rec-
ognized the progressive spirit of Pitt.
Of the many engineering schools in
this country, Pitt, according to this
'report, leads in the attempt to bring
together the theoretical and the prac-
tical. With such recognition our en-
gineering school must largely increase
in the next few years. The same
spirit which the government recog-
nized in ‘this article will lead to other

gineering construction. .

The article‘ says in short that the
co-operative plan will _enable the stu-
dent to observe in detail the methods
of production and the conduct of bus-
iness, and that, consequently, he will
be able to do his school work more ef-
fectively. Upon graduation he will
be of greater use to his employer and
further, the money consideration re-
ceived for his practical work will ro-
dinarily be suﬂicient to meet the ex-
pense of the entire course at the uni-
versity. Co-operative work may be
done, in connection with the course in
civil, electrical, chemical and sanitary
engineering. ‘*‘

Dr. B; L. Ullman was the representa-
tive of the University at the’meeti‘ngs
-of the Atlantic State held at Princeton
University, April 21-22.
that great interest is being shown by
the eastern colleges in the University
of Pittsburgh. Considerable interest
‘in the University was argused b ythe
"remarks of the outgoing president of
the Association, Prof. J. B. Hench of
Shadyside Academy. He quoted’ Chan-
-cellor McCormick as saying that the
«efforts of the trustees to raise one and
one half million dollars by next Febru-
ary are largely centered around the
college of the University.

« '“OBSTlNATE MARY.”

The Cap’ and‘ Gown to Give Their
Home Performance at the Nixon on
May -the 16th.

The members of the Cap and Gown
are working hard fortheir home pro-
duction at the Nixon on_the 16th of
May. This year, under, the leadership
of George M. Kirk, is to be the ban-
ner year. The performance promises
to excel anything that the Cap and
Gown have_done in the past, in spite
of former successes. “Obstinate Mary”
is the clever play which the Cap and
Gown have adopted this year. Many
good musical numbers have been in-
troduced- The music has been com-
posed by Lester ‘Taylor, famous by
“Hail to Pitt,” and the songs have been

contributed by McDaniel, Kirk and Ty-

ler. There will be about 15 in the
caste and twenty in the chorus. The
girls in the chorus. are sure to please.
Tonight at the Pittsburgh Athletic As-
sociation, the musical numbers of the
performance will be given. On the
15th, at Tarentum, for the beneﬁt of
the Allegheny Valley Hospital, the
club will perform the whole play. Af-
this experience, the Cap and Gown
will be at their best for the home per-
formance. The students should recog-
nize the hard work and good that the

Cap and Gown is doing for us. No one

can aﬁord to “miss ‘,‘Obst-inateb Mary.”

RECEPTION DRAWS

LARGE CROWI5 ;

 

Preparatory School Reception V Brings
Many Visitors-I-Fine Program Given
—Visitors Entertained With Dance.

 

Visiting Girls Make Hit.

Last Saturday night furnished the

surprise ofthe week. The invitations
sent out to the preparatory schools
not invited to the other receptions,
brought out a‘ crowd which ﬁlled the
chapel. In all, twenty-one high schools
were represented. _ Ofthe visitors, the
majority were girls. Indeed it looked
as if the girls of Pittsburgh and vicin-
ity were determined" to cometo Pitt
that we may have not only quality,
lbut quantity in our co-eds. The ear-
Elier part of the evening was devoted
to showing our visitors the buildings
and explaining the mysteries of the
many laboratories.
I — When all had arrived an interesting
program was-given. Miss Moldenhauer
entertained the audiencewith a pleas-
ing pianosolo. ‘

Chancellor McCormick though claim-
ing to have forgotten his stock speech
of welcome,,made a very humorous

and agreeable speech of welcome

The Professor of Coraopolis High
School respnded in a few fit and well
chsen wrds. Mr. Wettach of the Soph-
omore Class then informed us, in a
rather nervous and excited manner
how a young man went visiting in,neg-
ligee costume. A *

Following the formalprogram, re-
freshments were served, in the serv-
ing of which it is to be feared several
Freshmen got more ice cream than
was good for them. Then came danc-
ing until half past eleven, when Doc-

tor Felterman, in his character of

chaperon, ‘announced that it was time
for all good children to be in bed and
accordingly sent our visitors home.

Everyone left in the best of humor, _

hoping that the Student Senate will
hold such a reception every Saturday
night.

_TENN|‘S TOURNAMENT ON. V

Contest for Tennis Team Eliminating
Contestants.

Strong Team This Year.

Nearly all the preliminaries of the
tennis tournament have now been
played. Over half a dozen aspirants
for honor in this line have‘been elim-
inated from the contest. The excellent

weather has given the players many 3

opportunities for playing off. their

matches and it is probable that the ,

make-up of the varsity team will be
decided within the next few days_
There. is not much doubt, however,
that Mackrell, McEllroy, and probably
Wilbert are sure of their positions.

‘These men are conceded generally to

be the best players among the contest-
ants.
Summaries _

Lewis won from Camy, 6-4, 6-2.

Conrad won from Askin by default.

Sloan won from McCormick, 7-5, 6-1.

Wagoner won from Meyran by de-
fault‘. .

Grove ‘won from Patterson, 6-1, 7-5.

Crick won from Allison, 6-0, 6-0.

Stewart won from Bier, 7-5, 5-7,‘ 6-3.

The last match between Stewart and
Bier was both close and interesting,
being the only match requiring the
three sets.

The winner of the match between

McEl1roy and Conrad will meet Lewis *

for the varsity team. Sloan and Wag-
oner will play for a position on /the
varsity. Grove will play the winner of
the Haines-Wilbert match, and\Crick
will play the winner of the Mackrell-
Stewart ‘contest. The ﬁnal winners
will constitute the varsity team. It is
to be hoped thatthese matches will be
played as. soon as possible’ for the in-
ter-collegiate contests are now not far
off, and our men should have some
practice playing together before enter-
ing these. I

The team this year will be exception-
ally strong. Nearly every man on it
will be an experienced man who has
represented the University in previous

- contests. Last year our team made an

enviable record and the prospects this
year point to an even more successful-
season.
