Stiﬁ’ Questions Asked

‘.Villiam Randolph Hearst, “Ameri-

cas Nationalist Number 1," has been
sent an open letter by the Associa-
tion of College Editors, asking for a
clariﬁcation of his isolationist opin-
ions.

The leiter, signed by Francis G.
Smith, Jr.. editor of the Daily Prince-
tonian and president of the associa-
tion, subjects Mr. Hearst to the same
cross-examination to which Lord
Beaverbrook, English nationalist, was
asked to reply by Sir Norman Angeli.

Sir Norman, it is recalled, was
asked by Beverley Nichols, to draw up
a set of questions for Lord Beaver-
brook, after Beaverbrook had con-
sented to answer them. The college
editors group repeats the questions
in the letter to Mr. Hearst, but substi-
tutes the name Wil_liam Randolph
I-Hearst for Lord Beaverbrook, and
the Word America for Britain.

The questions follow:

1. Does Vvilliam Randolph Hearst
agree that if we pile on our already
shaken and disordered economic sys-
tem the further dislocations, unpay-
able‘ debts, revolutions, which we
now know arethe necessary legacy
of war and which so shook the rela-
tively sound system of 1914, that it
will probably ﬁnish off the present
order in chaos?

2. Is it Vvilliam Randolph Hearst's
general view that the" best Way to
prevent that recurrence is to continue
the old armament _competition and
decline to‘ discuss international agree-
ment or organization? If so, on what
grounds does he believe that the old
method will not produce the old re-
suit?

3. For a nation to be secure under
the competitive. principle it must be’
stronger than any possible rival. What
becomes of the rival? _ Isghe to go
without defense? ll-Iow shall defense
of each be managed under this plan
since the security of the one means
the insecurity of the other? Does
Vvilllam Randolph Hearst think that
there _is some system by which each
can be stronger than the other?

4. If, in order to be secure, Amer-
ica must make herself stronger than
a rival, does William Randolph
Hearst suggest that that rival will ac-
cept the situation and not resort to
alliance making? And if that rival
makes alliances, is America to refrain
from resorting to the same weapon?
An alliance is an arm, like a battle-
ship, or a submarine, adding to a na-
tion’s power. Are Americans to leave
this arm entirely in the hands of
prospective rivals?

5. ‘Front the time of Columbus to
‘Lindbergh there has not been a single
century in which America has -not
been drawn into the affairs of Europe.
Does William Randolph Hearst really
believe, if isolation was not possible

even in ancient times, a great
Power, a creditor nation_ such as
America in the days ofthe airplane
can continue to pursue isolationism?

Ralph Barsodi,

Plans of an all student written show

were discussed at the ﬁrst meeting of
the Cap and Gown Undergraduate
club held yesterday at 3:30 o’clock, in
Room 821, Cathedral.

The idea of a student written show
has been fostered ever since Cap and
Gown put on its ﬁrst show entitled
“ln ‘;V1ipland.” in 1908.

This year's procedure in asking for
student plans for the show will be
diii"e1'eiit than formerly. It has been
the policy of the Undergraduate club
to ask for separate skits, scenarios,
-and musical numbers, Such detached

I parts for the show, however, will not‘

jbe considered this year.

-Students interested in writing a
show should submit a complete manu-
script with all settings, scenes, and
dialogue to the office of the dean of

Manuscripts For Cap And Gown
 To Be Submitted By Undergraduates

linen, Room 801, Cathedral, no later‘,

gthan December 15,

' Mr. Theodore VV. Biddle, assistant
dean of men and member of the Grad-
uate club of Cap and Gown made the
following statement regarding student
submittances for the show:

, “Anyone interested in writing the
[show should understand that the pro-
duction of a student manuscript for
Cap and Gown is one of the highest
honors that can be awarded an under-
graduate. The Cap and Gown show,
one of the outstanding campus activi-
ties, is worth all the work that a full
. manuscript will demand, and if a stu-
dent has his show produced, he can
feel justly proud of his labors. Stu-
dents should remember that the manu-
scripts must be adapted to production
by an all-male cast and must also be

able to be produced economically.”

cause of the Student Ches-t, opening up
as it does, a larger and ﬁner concep-
ltion of society.”

War

W0 IDENTIFICATION discs,

one pending from the other
were worn about the neck of
every American soldier during the
World VVar. In case a soldier be-
came a battle casualty, one disc
was cut from its string, and the
other remained on the body. A
soldier who went without his
identiﬁcation discs was subject to
court-martial. ‘

To safeguard the identiﬁcation
system even further, the War‘ De-
partment now considers a plan to
tattoo soldiers for future wars. It
is explained that the identiﬁca-
tion discs were not infrequently
blown to pieces along with that
part of the wearer’s body from
which the tags were suspended.

In a literal sense, the new iden-
tiﬁcation scheme is pract.ica.lly
bomb-proof. It suggests tattoo-
ing the soldier on each shoulder

imand .the meaningless slaughter

inize and understand. But why must:
Ave be cool and calm and collected?‘
Why do we not recognize that war is
much closer around the corner than.-
prosperity? That we, we too, soon
will be slaughtering and being slaugh-
tered under old shibboleths of new’
phraseology? Why do we not race
through the streets shouting and cry-
ing our terror? VVhy? Because we
are not emotionally convinced. We
say: War may not come; we may
not enter it; I may not have to ﬁght;
I probably won’t be killed if I do.

But remember, the, question of war
is no longer whether but when, and
we will enter, and we will have to
ﬁght, and our hopes of safety will be
shattered. Let us face the probabili-
ties, face them clearly and honestly.
Unlikely it is that the Saar situation
will lead within the next few weeks
to war. But, be its time distance
that of months or years, it will come.
The present crisis is but another and
more violent one of the retchings
which are becoming more wracking,,
more deep, and which are leadingl
precipitously to the uncontrolled.-
vomiting of war.

See what it means, Again the pil-
lars of society wi.l make tools of
themselves. Again Christians will de-
of
other peoples. Again the press will
froth patriotism. Again the govern-
ment will plunge forth madly to per-
suade everyone to kill or to be killed
or to give money for killing. The Bi-
ble, the ﬂag, and the gun will be
placed on a table on top of which a
mad man will dance and yell hys-
terically and proclaim the cause of
the slaughter to be the preservation
of civilization. And the nation will
approve.

VVe shall denounce and make laws
against those who resist war and
slaughter and we shall call them de-
stroyers of civilization. VVe shall get

I

and hip. If so much as a mem-
ber remains, the casualty can be;
identiﬁed and given what may be}
called decent burial. 

“Basket cases,” newspaper ac-
counts point out, might cause
some confusion in the hospital. A
man who had run point-blank into
a high-explosive shell might lose
his identiﬁcation marks. But only
one soldier in about 5,000 goes to
his death this way.

So war becomes less horrible
for the Graves Registration serv-
ice.

of the first page the announcement of
a war-scare. France and Germany,
the article said, were jockeying for
excuses and for a favorable position
for throwing themselves at each oth-
er’s throats. But by morning the edi-
tors were not so alarmed. The war
story was now housed in a column on
the left of the front page and the
headlines had shrunk in size.

After the ﬁrst gasp of terror at the
thought of war, we too begin to quiet
down. Certainly we know that it is
no longer a question of whether but
when, but the actual terrifying reality
of war possibilities hits us only for
a moment; then we allow our defense
mechanisms to function. Some per-
sons probably exclaimed, “Huh, an-
other war scare.” Some probably
coolly analyzed the difficulties of the
Saar region. Others no doubt gave a
cold analysis of the rise of war from
the exigencies of the capitalistic sys-
tem.

All of the above reactions to the
threat of Franco-German war are of
importance We have had many war
scares, in many different localities
and times. Russia and Japan in the
Far East; Austria at the time of the
Dollfuss assassination; Italy and Ju-
goslavia before the recent assassina-
tions; the whole of Europe after them,
We have perpetual quarrelings over
the Saar, the Polish corridor, Ukrania,
and over practically every European
boundary.

We need to understand the situation
in the Saar, too. We need to see the
French fear of losing a large slice of
dividends, and the German happiness
in receiving it. We need to under-
stand the reasons why the Saar will
vote to become German. We need to
look at the League of Nations -as a
political offshoot of France and its
Russian and English allies.

Besides, we shall arrive nowhere if
we do not understand that war is en-
gendered not by the animal mentali-
ties of certain inferior peoples, or pri-
marily by a group of embittered muni-
tions-makers, but by the contradic-
tions and the economic battles of an
economic system, conditions which
force that economic system to anni-
hilate its citizens (greatest good for
the greatest number!) its ideas, and
itself. '

Then too, we can have little under-
standing of the setup of the next
debacle if we pay no attention to the
political allignments of Europe. We
have to look at Communist Russia
playing somewhat the same game of
ball that Czarist Russia played with
France. We have to know that Hitler
has forced England to look with new
love upon France. VVe must look for
new attitudes and alliances on the
part of Poland and certain countries
of the Little Entente, Jugoslavia par-
ticularly_ We must recognize Italy’s
hate for Jugoslavia and her probable
alliance with the likely winner of the
next war. We need to recognize the
muddled diplomacy of a Churchill-led
England which is as likely to blunder
into war now as in 1914.

 

rid of what is left of encumbering
ideas of free speech and thought and
action, and start out to rid the worl.d
of an enemy to civilization. VVe shall
have silly posters of Greek-goddess-
like liberty and beautiful smiling
soldiers. We shall have sentimental
cowardly war stories and plays. The
nation will be mad and the nation
will approve.

And in the name of civilization we
shall try to destroy with guns and
machines as many of our fellow-be
ings as possible; we shall not hesi-
tate to destroy the material housing
of our culture; 11or shall we stop to
consider the destruction of ideals,
the unhealthiness of mind, nor
the rise of demonic hopelessness and
terror—-feelings which the war will
create

Feel the horror, feel it now. Feel
it burning in your chests, your stom-
achs, Let your blood bound, your
head burn. Shout the imminence Ofl

or permanent commitments and be
guided by each circumstance as it
arises, was the method pursued be-
fore the war. Although America had
no League commitments in 1914 and
men up to the last, William Randolph
Hearst among them, proclaimed how
free their hands were, America was
drawn in, Does Vvilliam Randolph
Hearst think that America could have
kept out, that her entrance was a mis
take? " '

7. If he thinks America's entrance
was a mistake, would we have regard-
ed the victory of the Germanic pow-
ers, the creation, that is, of an heg-
emony so preponderant that America
could not have resisted any demands
that it cared to make upon Americans,
as a matter of indifference‘? If so,
why trouble about armaments at all
-~if it is a matter of indifference that
combinations, much stronger than
America, should arise?

8. If, on grounds of national secur-
ity, America cannot accept the pre-
ponderance of a foreign combination,
why should Americans expect foreign-
ers to accept theirs, especially as their
preponderance (the Allies) resulted in
imposing upon their rivals a treaty
which Mr. Hearst himself refers to as
the “Utter injustice of the Versailles
treaty?”

9. On the eve of the war, Sir Ed-
ward Grey declared that the only
possible alternative to the see-saw of
the balance of power, by which the
precarious defense of one was
achieved by the depriving of the other
of all defense, was for both to pool
their power to secure the observance
of a common rule of international
life, like arbitration of disputes, to
build up what Asquith called the com-
munity of power behind the law. On
what general grounds does ‘William
Randolph Hearst differ from that
view?

In his book, Cry Havoc, Beverley
Nichols quotes Lord Beaverbrook’s
reply,

“It would take me a great deal of
labor and time to answer the ques-
tions as they should be answered. In
the busy life I lead, I do not have the
opportunity to do so. It is too big
a proposition for me.”

The open letter has been sent to
editors to 644 editors of American col-
lege papers. Mr. [Hearst is urged in
it to reply, because:

“Yours is a tremendous influence in
America. More than any other man
you represent the power of the
press. What you believe, you have
the power to lead millions of other

Americans to believe. That is why
it is so tremendously important that
you explain and deﬁne “nationalism"
as opposed to the “internationalisn1”
embodied in the spirit of the League
of Nations, to those of my generation
who are about to believe——one way or

Yes, all these things we must recog-

Past performances this season
make the Penn State eleven slight fa-

present the State team has wiped up
their opponents in an overwhelming
fashion, taking them all by very de-

freshman team looms as one of the
best aggregations in recent years. On
the other hand, the Panther freshies
have had only an average season.
winning one, losing one, and tying
one. However, the Panthers have
shown great improvement in the past
few weeks and stand a good chance
of surprising the boys from State.

Several of the Pitt ﬁrst team play-
ers, out last week with injuries, are
back in good physical condition and
will probably start in the game to-
morrow. Patrick, regular fullback,
and Richards, tackle, have recovered
sufficiently to start. Shaw, varsity
end, and Matisi, tackle, will probably
be unable to play. _

The game is scheduled to begin at 2
o’clock, giving the Panther squad some
time to rest before the starting
whistle. The bus, carrying the play-
ers and coaches, will probably arrive

at State college a little after 10
o’clock tomorrow morning.

Panther ‘B’ Team Plays
In Morgantown Tomorrow

While their big football brothers are
at Lincoln, the Panther “B" team
journeys to Morgantown tomorrow for
their ﬁrst game of the season against
the West Virginia “B” team.

Twenty football players, with Stew-
art McAwley, assistant varsity foot-

morrow morning at 7 o’clock by bus
for Morgantown. The game is to get
under way at 12:30 o'clock.

Their opening game with Bucknell
only three weeks away, the basketball
squad is getting down to work in

Panther Runners
Start Westward

Coach Olson’s Harriers Will Run
In National Junior Classic

Trekking westward with their trek
shoes under their arms, the varsity
harriers left this morning for Indian-
apolis, Indiana, where they will par-
ticipate in the running of the Nation-
al junior cross-country meet.

The same men that swamp-ed the
Irish invaders last week are making
the trip. They are Charles Kirkpat-
rick, Sam Musico, Kenneth Wagon-
houser, Vvilliam Albright, Harold Test,
and Charles Howe. The remaining
members of the party making the
jaunt are Coaches Olson and Potts and
Manager VVilliam Dornenburg.

Facing the crack teams of Indiana,
the Melrose athletic club, and the
Meadowbrook athletic club in this na-
tional event, the runners will" be up
against the strongest array of dis-
tance nren they have-‘yet -faced. T-he
Melrose and Meadowbrook clubs are
two of the strongest in the east and
Indiana university is well-known
throughout the country for its power-
ful teams.

While the varsity is away, the
freshman hill and dalers will take
things easy until Monday morning
when they stack up against Penn
State’s strong yearlings at Schenley
Park. In itslast meet, the State team
easily trounced the Syracuse fresh-
men, This is the ﬁrst important con-
test of the fresh schedule and Coach
Olson will start his entire ﬁrst-year
outﬁt.

tional 13 to 0 victory over the Chem.
Engineers, the miners duplicated that
test Friday against the Civil Engi-
neers.

The Miners entered the game as
underdogs, l:ut unleashed a brillia-it
offense which ﬁnally netted two tou<~.1i-
downs, while they held their opp:.-11-
ents scoreless.
