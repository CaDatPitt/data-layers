Career seminars set for Sept. 30

By John Zaphyr
Staff Writer

Public relations, advertising sales,
medical ‘technology, computer
science and international business
are among the 250 fields to be
represented at Pitt’s Career Seminar
Series at the end of this month.

The series gives students and area
residents a chance to explore career

.options by talking with profession-

als from local companies and organ-
izations and with representatives
from law schools across the country.

“You can’t get this kind of infor-
mation anywhere,” said career
seminar staff member Nancy Jasie-
wicz. “During the conventional
career" development program you
don’t really get a chance to meet peo-
ple in business. You look at pam-
phlets and maybe talk to somebody
over the phone, but here you can
actually sit down and talk to some-
one in business candidly and you’ll
get to know them and hopefully they
will get to know you.”

The seminars will be held at the
William Pitt Union from 1-4 p.m.
daily Monday, September 30
through Thursday, October 3. A
special evening seminar will be held

; on Tuesday, Octoberrl from ,5-8

    

“The seminars are
very informal. Anyone
can just walk off the
street and come in.
There isn’t any dress
code and you don ’t need

g tickets to get in.” '

The four-day event is geared to a
variety of people: those who are try-
ing to decide on a college major,
need tips on job hunting, or are
thinking about a career change. The
sessions are informal, open to
anyone, and there is no admission
fee.

During the sessions, individuals
can discuss career options with pro-
fessionals to find out information
such as the advantages and disad-
vantages of various careers, the
recommended education and expe-
rience for those ﬁelds, and future
employment prospects.

The seminars are primarily
intended for the gathering of infor-
mation, but contacts for jobs can be
made and occasionally individuals
attending the seminars have found
employment.

“This seminar is not for recruiting
purposes, ’ said Jasiewicz, “but peo-
ple have_been known to get Jobs after
our seminars."

To highlight the seminars, guest
speaker ,Myles Harrington, a local
investment banker, will offer tips on
using an unconventional approach
to breaking into the competitive job
market.

PR concern

  Pitt urged to better 

  H.S. relationships

By Nancy Quick
Assistant News Editor

The advancement of education
requires an improvement in the rela-
tionship between educational insti-
tutions at the the university,
secondary and primary school lev-
els, according to Pitt President Wes-
ley Posvar. '

In an address to the Council of
Great City Schools this past week-
end, Posvar presented some of Pitt’s

solutions to this communication .

problem — a problem, Posvar said,
that makes the United States “a
nation at risk.”

“Higher education and the sectors
of primary and secondary education

- that precede it are, in some ways,

remote from one another,” Posvar
said. “Schools of education are often
sources of distrust. Reward systems
in the schools and the college cam-
puses are different and often misun-
derstood. ..We compete for public
funds, and our teachers and profes-
sors are often strangers. This has to
change, and in Pittsburgh we are try-
ing to change it.”

Posvar attributed the source of
the problem to “a generic weakness
in our basic and secondary educa-
tion, particularly in math and
science.”

“We rank last among our major
allies and adversaries in the percent-
ages of high school students taking
three years of science and math,” he
said. “Eighty-four percent .of U.S.
students take no physics and 65 per-
cent take no chemistry. All students
in the Soviet Union complete four
years of chemistry, including a full
year of organic chemistry.”

Posvar presented the recommen-
dations of a national study which he
headed on “Technical Excellence in
America,” and the university's role.

First, he stressed that the arts,
social sciences, and written and oral
expressions are of parallel impor-
tance to math and science. ,

“Putting in stronger academic
requirements quickly translates into
results,” he said. “People really do
take more courses, and they do earn
better grades, when they are told
they have to, to cross a certain

threshold.” _

Posvar also said that schools need
to add an international dimension
and not leave that aspect to colleges.
“The nature of the world economy
and its information systems man-

- date this priority,” he said.

Finally, Posvar called for action

at the local level, and pointed to the .

“Pittsburgh Public Schools Partner-

ship Program” in progress at the"

University Honors Program(UHP).
“Embraced with enthusiasm by

our students,the program is a won-

derful success,” Posvar said.
The UHP partnership program

with the Pittsburgh public schools is»
one through which a Pitt honors stu-

dent can go into a public school and
serve a function, but not as a
replacement or a teacher’s aid.
“It’s a creative endeavor in which
our students do something to enrich
the public school program,” said
Kim Watterson, honors program

coordinator of advisors. “It's some-,

thing that wouldn't be done if we -I

didn't do it.” '
Students initiate after.-school
clubs, informal interactions with
foreign students and other projects.‘
“At Reizenstein, honors students
meet with foreign students to discuss

concepts and issues on an informal '

level. They do not serve as English
tutors,” Watterson said. “In the pro-
cess of learning a new language and
trying to study other academic sub-
jects in the new language, it's nice for
a foreign student to be able to dis-

cuss other issues with someone who .

can speak his or her own language. ”

“The relationship is truly a symbi-
otic one,” said Alec Stewart, direc-
tor of the UHP. ”Both participants
benefit — public schools and univer-
sity students + and it creates an
opportunity for students to put as

.3

much back into education as they I

are currently getting out of it._” 4

Posvar supports the UHP p,ro- A

gram as an example of action at the
local level. “It is not enough to stir
up the public about the ‘Nation at
Risk’ or for people like me to chair
board studies,” Posvar ‘said. “The
need comes down to actual schools
working with actual universities in
actual communities.”

Freeman passed over
by Wisconsin system

By Dan Bates
News Editor

Pitt’s Office of Administration
disclosed Friday that Executive Vice
President Dr. Jack Freeman is no
longer a candidate for position of
president at the University of Wis-
consin System. .

The announcement came
moments before Wisconsin's board
of regents released an official state-
ment which named University of
Southern Illinois Chancellor Ken-
neth Shaw as the new president.

Shaw was reportedlyone of three

, State University President Jack Nel-

son and Freeman. Nelson was
believed to be the first choice, but he
apparently declined the position.
Forty-six-year-old Shaw will
begin his term as president on Feb-
ruary I, 1986. He will become Wis-
consin System’s fourth president.
Shaw was selected after a search
committee sifted through more than
150 applications. By last week, the
list had been narrowed to six ﬁnal-
ists, then three. '
Wisconsin will be paying Shaw up

to $100,000 to run the 26-campus _

statewide university.
Dr. Freeman would not comment
on the selection proceedings. 7 .

The Pitt News - September 23, 1985

French admit intelligence officers sank Greenpeace ship

PARIS (UPI) — The French
government admitted yesterday that
intelligence officers sank the ﬂag-

‘ ship of the Greenpeace environmen-

tal group in Auckland, New Zealand
in July of this year. Prime Minister
Laurent Fabius said the agents were
acting under government orders and
that they covered up their actions
during a recent official inquiry. He
further stated that the agents will not
be punished, although a Greenpeace
photographer was killed when the
mines sank the Rainbow Warrior.
Fabius said the government
approves of the creation of a parlia-
mentary commission of inquiry to
investigate the bombing.

Prime Minister Fabius’ statement
yesterday is the latest development
in what has become an increasingly
embarrassing scandal for President
Francois Mitterand, which has
involved high-level government
appointees. A major shake-up of the
Defense Ministry has ensued,
including the resignation of Defense
Minister Charles Henru'and the dis-
missal of the chief of French intelli-
gence, Adm. Pierre Lacoste. These
changes were announced on Friday
after President Mitterrand had ear-
lier called upon the intelligence
agency to enact “changes in the per-
sonnel and, in case of need, in struc-
ture,” according to the NYT.

The Greenpeace ‘ship was des-

piﬂ
to ram
ou cil

troyed on July 10 shortly before it
was to lead a flotilla of protesters to
the French nuclear testing grounds
in Mururora. A Portugese photo-
grapher in the ship's crew was killed
in the second of two explosions
while attempting to salvage his
equipment.

Fabius’ statement that agents will
not be punished contradicts earlier
promises that anyone found guilty
of carrying out the operations would
be held responsible. Recent events
also contradict the conclusions of an
earlier government inquiry which
found no major involvement of
high-level government officials.
Although President Mitterrand has
not been implicated in the intelli-
gence activities, Henru’s resignation
raised suspicions; Henru has been a
close associate of President Mitter-
rand for some 30 years.

Aid arrives to
Mexico City

MEXICO CITY (UPI) — U.S.
Ambassador John Gavin said in
Mexico Friday that as many as
l0,000 people died in the two devas-
tating earthquakes that struck Mex-
ico late last week. The statement was
dramatic in view of earlier estimates
which put the death-toll at around

3,000. The Mexican government has
since confirmed the deaths of more
than that number. At a news confer-
ence on Saturday at the American
embassy in Mexico, Gavin also said
the calamity caused hundreds of mil-
lions of dollars in damage. Five U.S.
citizens have been confirmed dead.
Nine are reported still missing.

Relief efforts have mounted as
planes arrive from Switzerland,
France, and Israel with teams of
doctors and specialists. Rescue
workers are employing dogs to
locate victims beneath the rubble.
The American Red Cross has asked
people not to send food and clothes
to relief agencies aiding the victims.
Officials said that money is needed
more than materials to buy neces-
sary medical supplies.

Some controversy has arisen in
the U.S. as to how to best go about
supplying relief. Texas governor
Mark White said he was shocked
yesterday to hear that a top official
in the Reagan administration is try-
ing to keep Texans from helping
Mexico. He attacked Assistant
Secretary of State Elliot Abrams’
request that San Antonio Mayor
Henry Cigneros and former U.S.
Ambassador Bob Kruger not go to
Mexico to offer help from Texans.
White said an offer of help from
Texas was warmly received by Mex-

ican authorities. -

Dollar value too
high?

NEW YORK (UPI) —- Finance
Ministers from the U.iS., Japan,
West Germany, Britain and France
met yesterday behind closed doors
in an attempt to lower the value of
the American dollar against other
currencies, especially the Japanese
yen. No statement has officially been
made about the nature of the discus-
sions and what has been concluded
as of yesterday. The hope is to lower
the U.S. trade deficit. One Treasury
Department official blames the
strong dollar on the U.S. trade
imbalance, which is heading toward
a record $150 billion this year. The
meeting came one day before Presi-

'dent'Reagan was to give a major

speech on trade .policy.

arms issues, Reagan has said he has
no plans to bargain away the future

Economy rises at

WASHINGTON (UPI) —' The
government has reported that the
nation’s economy is growing at a
mediocre pace of 2.8 percent in the
current quarter. That’s the initial
estimate of expansion of the gross
national product for the three-
month period ending Sept. 30. The
figure will be revised .a couple of
times next month as more figures
come in. But analysts said the
numbers indicate a growth rate this
year of about 2 percent, less than
half of last year’s 5.7 percent.

The Pitt News - September 23 1985

Firth addresses studentapathy as ‘

By Kathy Campbell

Staff Writer

College youth of the 1980s — the
prevailing notion has been that of
the self-absorbed yuppie, the‘ stu-
dent too career-minded to look past
the realm of the resume into political
or social involvement —— the apa-
thetic student. .

Pitt’s student profile hasn’t been
far from the national one. Whether
it’s student football, South African
divestment, or the nuclear arms
build-up, the visible reaction of Pitt
students has been less than
enthusiastic,

For Pitt’s coordinator of New
Student Affairs, Robert Firth,
addressing student apathy is his
main concern. “It just looks so hope-
less,” Firth said. “The problem of
student apathy has become a cultu-
ral phenomenon.” He explained that
although it may appear that students
on other campuses such as Harvard
are somewhat more involved,- that
may not always be the case.

Firth said he does not believe that
gathering students at a football
game (as the Student Government
attempted as one solution to the
problem of student apathy), or
encouraging everyone to join an
organization, are solutions to the
problem of apathy.

“I’m not saying don’t get
involved,” said Firth. “Activities
have their place. But pushing stu-
dents to become involved may be
more harmful than helpful.

“The idea of everyone having an

emotional tie to Pitt can be suffocat-
ing. lt’s like students trying to wear
their campus involvement like a
Brooks Brothers suit,” stated Firth.
“This ‘rah-rah’ at footbal games and
Band-Aid sort of thing can distract
attention from an individual’s very
real problems. These are not
solutions.”

According to Firth, the core of the
problem is not that students don’t
seem to want to get involved, but
that students are not thinking in the
proper manner.

“There are basically three things
that seem to exacerbate the problem
of student apathy,” said Firth. First
of all, most college students today
are first generation college students,
so they really have no idea of know-
ing what college is all about. .

Another problem is the large per-
centage of commuting students.
“Students who are commuters don’t

feel attached,” said Firth. “After a ,

few hours ofclass, most fee-l like they
want to relax. It’s toomuch trouble
to hang around for activities, so they
leave.”

Firth’s solution to this problem is
to create a base on campus for com-
muters — somewhere where they
could receive phone messages, mail
or just drop their books between
classes.

Firth suggests giving each com-
muter a desk where they could keep
books, or mailboxes. “This would be
costly,” he admitted, “but so is
20,000 dollars worth of ﬁber optics.
It’s all just a matter of what the uni-
versity wants to spend money on —

 

 
   

Da he Pitt Nes

what they feel is moreimportant.”

The final problem, according to
Firth, is that the faculty members
may not be completely committed to
teaching. ‘

“A lot of faculty members take
their classes too much for granted,”
stated Firth. “They just teach the
subject without really considering it.
They say things like, ‘You don’t
really have to come to class — just
read the textbook and you should
pass.’ A student hears this while
walking into a large introductory
class for the first time and what does
this do for him? The instructors
might think they're doing the stu-
dents a good turn, like they wouldn’t
be able to manage in any other way.

  

They think they have to make it easy
on them. That's not right.” ,

Firth believes this just turns the
students off. “There‘s no real learn-
ing in that," said Firth. “I would like
to see all of the universitv focus on
having the students involved in what
they are learning," Firth added,
pointing out that the composition
program here is one that he feels is
an ideal example of this.

As Firth explained, the composi-
tion program does not teach stu-
dents the basic ways of writing, such
as heading, body, etc. Instead, they
teach them to write what things
‘mean to them. They break the tradi-
tional forms of writing, and stress
that the most important aspect is
that the student has something to
say instead of getting everything in
its proper place.

Firth added that another aspect of
student apathy is that students look
at schoolwork as something they
have to get through.

“A student needs collegiality — a
togetherness,” said Firth. “That’s
what collegiality is all about."

In Firth‘s opinion, it takes a cour-
ageous faculty member to realize
how limited his knowledge is. They
are the ones who don't try to make
everything look easy for the students
and who encourage them to dig
deeper into the subject.

The inability to form a cohesive
college community from a huge stu-
dent body, according to Firth, is
another element contributing to stu-
dent apathy at Pitt.

At a smaller college, for example,

 

V Page 3

‘cultural phenomenon”

one student may be in a particular
class with another; the two may also
have the same advisor or Resident
Assistant, and they may be involved
in the same activities. Thus, the two
students become closer. But on a
campus the size of Pitt’s, a student
may see one group of fellow students
in a classroom, and never see those

students anywhere else on or off

campus. This prevents them from
forming a sense of community.

“The real problem is that there is
no sense of community," Firth said.
“As a part of a community, students
learn together, ask questions
together, and live together. Without
that sense, mostjust get through the
hours of classes. Other than that,
there is no collegiality.”

Firth’s personal solutions to the
problem involve summoning the
incoming students to poke at the
meaninglessness in their classes, and

_ to challenge their teachers.

He also suggested a change in the

way that students are assigned resi- .

dent assistants, mentors and advi-
sors, so that perhaps students may
share a common authority figure on
campus. Considering the size of the
campus, this would not be an easy
task. Yet Firth will continue to try.

Firth was initially an advisor
before being assigned to his present
position in I979. He has already suc-
ceeded in turning the orientation
program around by dividing the
more detailed and technical aspects
of the advising sessions from the
more social and general information
events ‘

,‘All-Star’ Immunity

When the jury handed down the decision to convict Phila-
delphia caterer Curtis Strong on cocaine trafficking charges on
Friday afternoon, Major League Baseball came out smelling
like a rose.

Prosecuting attorney J. Alan Johnson used what could have
been assembled as an all-star team to convict Strong. The sad
thing about it was that the players who comprised this all-star
team were admitted cocaine users, yet they were granted
immunity from prosecution. Strong was taken to the lockup
on Friday. The players returned to the baseball season, free to
resume their lives.

Evidently, in order to get these players to testify, the govern-
ment must have caught each one of them with their hand in the
cookie jar, so to speak. In future cases, the government should
not grant total immunity to guilty parties. Deals can be worked
out, but no that drastically. Cocaine trafficking is a crime, no
argument here, but so is possession of cocaine, and it should be
punished accordingly.

Farm Aid?

The organizers of yesterday's Farm Aid concert at the Uni-
versity of Illinois should be commended. Their intentions and

efforts raised a great deal of money for, and attention to, the .

economic crisis which is farming in the United States.

However, it seems that something was missing. The enthusi-
asm and support seemed so much stronger during the Live Aid
shows two months ago, when our country found the need to
work in the relieving of those starving in Africa.

Instead of front page stories with banner headlines, the
Farm Aid extravaganza merited just a short story on page 12
of our city's Sunday newspaper. And could there possibly be a
legitimate reason for the more than 10,000 empty seats yester-
day? Maybe the plea would have been better accepted, if it
weren’t a football Sunday. Maybe our country doesn’t want to
understand how rough the farmers’ times are.

Nothing should be said to denigrate the efforts to help the
starving in Africa and more recently the earthquake victims in
Mexico, but something more should be done for the people
here at home —— the farmers.

Food Fights

For the last five or six years,
Lothrop Cafeteria has experienced
three or four food fights a term. In
response, Pitt management has
ordered half a dozen Pitt campus
policemen to stop and/ or counter
this affliction. '

On April 2, 1985, several Lothrop
Cafeteria employees sought to meet
with Mr. Don Hughes (food service
and housing director) through their
Local No. 29 AFL-CIO business
representative. Hughes’ response
was that no purpose would be served
by meeting with these employees.

Evidently, Hughes feels no desire
to receive input from his employees
about resolving this troublesome
issue. It is important to mention here
that CMU,'Carlow College, Robert
Morris College, Duquesne U., and
Chatham College do not suffer from
this affliction and that only Pitt’s
Lothrop Hall does.

Unfortunately, this .issue proba-
bly will not be resolved until some-

~ one sustains a serious eye injury.

Also, at this time, it seems worthy to
mention that President Posvar’s 3-
year reorganization plan to remodel,
renovate and reorganize the Univer-
sity for the future should take a back
seat to this most pressing and serious

awash in controversy. I’m not refer-

here to broaden our horizons and all
that; still, I think the huge majority
of us at Pitt call it “pop,”not “soda.”
I may-be way off base here, but when

The second and not-so-major
controversy has to do with the Pitt
insignia. The old Pitt design had a
lot of character to it. You've surely
seen it around; it has a candle with
the Cathedral and the inscription

_“Lux et Veritas” (‘.‘Truth and Lux-

ury"?). It has the feel of tradition —
of things olden — about it. The
modern Pitt insignia is an embar-

i rassing blob. It even looks like it’s

embarrassed itself — the three cir-
cles look like a little face with a ter-
minal “Oh, nooo!” etched across it.
Give them a box of crayons, and the
children up in campus nursery will
come up with much more imagina-
tive and admirable designs. Again, I
may be way off base, but I have to
look at that dumb design on the

it's getting on my nerves.

The third one, I must admit, is
really non-controversy. But anyway,

more, then I looked again. By gum,
there actually are a lot of girls
around the campus wearing men’s

realizedat once that something was
amiss here. At first I thought, “Gee,
if some guy walked around with his
boxer shorts on the outside of his

send him to Penn State.” But then,
the more I thought about it, I real-

Please Clarify

I noticed Dr. Magill’s letter (Sep-
tember 20) about my column on
teachers who cannot teach and, after

reading it, had to scratch my head in

puzzlement. Dr. Magill appears to
make three points: one, he read my
column; two, he was read similar
criticism about the problem in the
International Herald Tribune; and
three, he asks, “Does Pitt need this
adverse publicity?"

Dr. Magill, what are you trying to /1

tell us?

At first, I thought Dr. Magill was
pointing out that the problem of
teachers who cannot teach is inter-
national. On second ponderance, I
thought he was accusing me of pla-
giarizing ideas from the Tribune for
my column (I, by the way, only read
the New York Times and my local
newspaper, the Lancaster New Era,

when it comes to such reading mate-

rial). Finally, I came to believe that
he was saying that the problem
should be ignored because it tar-
nishes this university’s image.

I appreciate Dr. Magill sharing
his views in the Pitt News because I
believe the problem should be exam-
ined and debated; it affects a large
percentage of the student popula-
tion here at Pitt. 1, as well as many
Pitt News readers, hope that Dr.
Magill will write again to the editor
to clarify and substantiate his opin-
ions on this matter.

Cancel Debt

All summer long, I’ve been listen-
ing to the politicians say, “We are
saddling our kids with a tremendous
burden,” etc., concerning the
national debt. They just assume that
we will gladly give them 50 percent-
plus of our lifetime earnings to pay
those who have been ripping off
government‘ all these years. They
don’t even think enough of us to ask
us how we feel about payingtheir
debt.

I hope you will publish this letter
and I hope the readers will be as
angry as I am and do something
about it. If the students of the '60s
and "705 can protest the Vietnam
War and if students can demonstrate
against South Africa then I am sure
we can organize to save our own
livelihoods.

I propose the country cancel the
debt. (I am not talking about a bal-
anced budget amendment, I am talk-
ing, cancel the debt. First things
first.) We can organize protests,
band together with other students,
educate other students about the
debt, hold marches, get publicity,
and whatever else it takes until the
debt is cancelled.

Let the politicians know who will

decide this issue.

The Pitt News - September 23, 1985

Simply Speaking/Michael Ashford  

A Process of Militarization in America

There is little that is novel in the
process many sociologists and polit-
ical scientists have termed the “mil-
itarization of the United - States.”
Having a “strong defense” is as inte-
gral a part of the American ethos as
owning a car and watching televi-
sion. And the military as a political
institution in the United States has
enjoyed a status of great power and
inﬂuence since at least the end of
World War II.

But the form the military takes in
our society and the role it plays in
our culture has been changing. This
is the process of militarization
referred to in current terms. Levels
of militarization fluctuate in any
society, and their correlation to the
likelihood of war is historically evi-
dent. Thus, we must look critically
at what is happening now: what
changes are we experiencing and
what do they mean?

The first part of the question is
easier to answer. The U.S. populace
elected a president in 1980 whose
personalfimage and rhetoric are
built around militarism. Ronald
Reagan, the gun—slinging, rugged
individualist of B—movies, told us
that “heads will roll in Washington”;
he told us that we were going to “get
tough on Communism” abroad; he
told us we could have and should

. have won in Vietnam. Most impor-

tantly, he told us we were weak and
that we needed to make sacrifices in

- order to be strong again.

The consequences of the policies
and attitudes inspired by such an
ideology are difficult to compre-
hend. We seem to have quickly for-
gotten the 400 Marines who died in
Lebanon (a sacrifice) but retain
much better the “emancipation” of
the oppressed Grenadian people.
Strong again? We’ve reduced spend-
ing on almost every social program
(sacrifice) but don’t seem to know
how to handle an “inexplicable"
projected fiscal debt of more than
$200 billion, largely accredible to
massive military outlays. I ask, “Is
this strength?”

It may seem strange that the Uni-
ted States currently has the largest
standing volunteer army in its his-
tory, until we consider teenage
unemployment rates, the costs of a
college education and federal stu-
dent loan cuts. Suddenly, what is
happening becomes frighteningly
logical.

Culture in the United States pre-
dominantly consists of images, most
of them commercially produced.
True to our enterprising spirit,
culture-conscious media—makers
capitalized on our perceived need
for sacriﬁce and desire for renewed

strength. Now we can enjoy films

like “Red Dawn” and “Rambo,”
which make militarism something
we can fit into our everyday life.
Whether these needs are imagined or
real is inconsequential; ‘we’re doing
our best to satisfy them. President
Reagan displayed his satisfaction by
transforming “Rambo” into a verb.

The signs are multifarious and
subtle. Perhaps few of us have
noticed that many of our TV heroes
are now Vietnam veterans — a
strange way to integrate an explo-
ited and alienated segment of our
adult population back into ideal
America.

These changes reflect the complex
workings of social, economic and
political forces. A renowned psycho-
historian, Lloyd de Mause, cited the
anthropological, universal ritual
rites of sacrifice, cleansing and
rebirth to explain America's sub-
conscious needs today: We’re guilty
over our relative prosperity and
have entered a long phase of sacri-
fice and rebirth, complete with real
blood.

Perhaps more convincingly, our
current infatuation with the military

stems from powerful economic for-
ces that we would rather ignore. Our
economy is frighteningly dependent
on defense industries. These indus-
tries are inextricably entwined with
our government institutions.
Because of this cooperation, which
C. Wright Mills called “the military-
industrialist complex,” our econ-
omy is experiencing a short-lived
economic growth almost imme-
diately after military outlays have
been sharply increased. Essentially,
military spending is being used as a

fiscal policy tool.

The two above analyses are con-
vincingly maintained by many
today. They, the rational economic
and irrational psychic, correspond
to produce the changes we are expe-
riencing now. Abroad, we are faced
with further threats to the interna-
tional economic stability that we so
strongly desire -that it often contra-
dicts our social and political ideals
(e.g., Central America).

lt is unlikely that any of these
institutions will change, although we

must remain optimistic. We should
at least be critically aware of how
conducive the domestic and interna-
tional situation are (both psycholog-
ical and economically) to a major
military confrontation and the dev-
astation it would wreak upon us all.
The world does look to the United

States for guidance in making its‘

own decisions, whether they “like”
us or not. If we don’t have enough
energy to write to our congressmen,
maybe we have enough energy to
avoid movies like “Rambo.”

Pitt, local merchants host picnic
to boost team community spirit

By Mark Shenilan
Staff Writer

Forbes Avenue was filled with
Panther nostalgia Saturday morn-
ing as the Oakland merchants
fielded what many would call a pre-
game tailgate party with the entire
Oakland community involved for
the first time ever.

The first daytime PITT-nic was
sponsored by the Oakland Business
and Civic Association (OBCA) in
conjunction with the University of
Pittsburgh, prior to Saturday's
game against Boston College.

Families, students, and senior citi-
zens joined the fun as a dozen Oak-
land merchants set up in front of the
Law School Building. Youngsters
impatiently waited for a free t-shirt
bearing Tony Dorsett’s number,
given away at the stadium. The Pitt
Band played, and Panther cheer-
leaders greeted those in attendance.

The event began at 10 a.m. and
ran until noon, 10 minutes before
game time. Since it was nationally
televised, the game was moved up 50
minutes from 1 p.m. to l2:l0 p.m.
The crowd arrived late and left early
to get good seats at the stadium for
the pre-game excitement.

”Everyone has this image of Oak-
land as ‘this dangerous, dirty place,
and we want to defeat‘ that image
‘and allow families and students to
have a good time," said Pitt Sports
Information intern Paul Fischer.
”We want to show the communit ,~
that Oakland is a good safe place to
go and a fun place to be with a dis-
tinct shopping area.”

As a combined effort of the uni-
versity and the merchants of Oak-
land, the PITT-nic was held to
promote community involvement
and support the Pitt football team.

Although university students
were in sparse attendance the mer-

“Everyone has this image of Oakland as this danger-

and allow families and students to have a good
time.”

Paul Fischer

Pitt Sports Information Intern

A large banner bearing the words
”Oakland, A World Within a City”
stretched across Forbes Avenue
adding community interest to the
day's events. The association sold
hats with this motto to several Oak-
land residents for $5 each.

The Dennis Painter family of
Clarion, Pa., came early and
brought a neighbor, Mike Kentley,
14, of Clarion. Painter remarked,”I
liked the first PITT-Nic and will be
back again. The night game against
Purdue added much excitement to
the last one.”

Daughter Jamie,9, liked the band
especially.

Gary Fulton, of Johnstown came
early because of the PITT.-nic. He
read about it in the Johnstown Trib-
une Democrat and was anxious to
see what it was like.

Chuck Walters, President of the
OBCA, thought the event was a suc-
cess and a step in the right direction
in getting the entire community
involved. He said, “Since the game
time was changed, many fans could
not stay as long as they would have
liked to.”

Walters commented that clowns
and entertainment were to be pro-
vided, but they could not make it.
He said the orginization is now bet-
ter equipped for the next PITT-nic
to be held in the Forbes Quad Build-
ing, prior to the Syracuse game on
November 2. He hopes more mer-
chants will see the need and get
involved.

chants were optimistic that the
PITT-nic scheduled for November
will attract more students.

The first night PITT-nic effort
was held by the newly formed
OBCA prior to Pitt's first night
game against Purdue on August 31.

Beer was served at that event, but
there was no beer to be seen on Sat-
urday. According to OBCA repre-
sentatives, the organization had
decided not to serve beer in an
attempt to cater to the many families
supporting the Panther ball club.

Food was in great abundance;
everything from foot-long subs at
Blimpie’s stand to pizza sold by
Napoli’s.

Former Steeler great Franco Har-
ris drew a large crowd in front of
Peppi’s booth. Harris, wearing a
Peppi’s apron, sliced hoagies and
entertained the local Pittsburgh
crowd.

Harris, part-owner" of Peppi’s,
said,”I think it's great that OBCA
wants to _do, something for their
community." Harris thoroughly
enjoyed himself, signing autographs
to the delight of young and old
Steeler fans alike.

WPTS provided live remote
broadcast from the event from 10
a.m. till noon.

Tom Sabol, proprietor ‘of the
Campus Store, challenged many toa
quick game of checkers. The object
was to beat Sabol and earn a refund
on the item‘ purchased from his
stock.

Davis’
premier
agma
success”

By Jim Brueclmer
Staff Writer

On Saturday afternoon, Pitt run-
ning back Brian Davis resembled
Hawkeye Pierce. What he was doing
was fantastic, but the reasons for its
necessity were not exactlythe best.
Hawkeye was forced into the busi-
ness of saving lives by the Korean
War. Davis was forced into proving
his recruiters wise by running for 100
yards in his collegiate debut by an
injury to Charles Gladman.

‘ Gladman has been a pleasant sur-
prise this season. When he left the
game on Saturday, he had already
gained 121 yards on the afternoon.
He now has accumulated 387 yards

in the first three games. How long,

has it been since a Panther back has
started a season with such promise?
But when Gladman went down with

"an injury, a cloud rose over Pitt Sta-

dium and with it came that all-
important question: “If he can’t
come back right away, can anyone
continue the success of the Pitt run-
ning game?” That question was ans-
swered in the form of a man who
wore the number 34 across his chest
and the name Davis across his
shoulders. '

After the game, Davis said, “All I
want to do is run.” A man of mys-
tery, he is not. He wanted a chance
to prove that he could carry that
load and he disappointed no one.

Said coach Foge Fazio, “I
thought Brian Davis played very
well. We said all along that he was a
great prospect.”

Actually, “prospect" is an under-

statement to what was said about .

Davis prior to his debut. He was
even com_p_ared at _great length to

Freshman Brian Davis left Mike Ruth and the rest of Boston College defense in
the dust as he led Pitt’s second half comeback on Saturday.

Pitt's all-time leading rusher and‘
former Heisman Trophy winner ‘

Tony Dorsett. It is a comparison
that Davis would like to avoid.
“Well, like I said, there's only one
Tony Dorsett.”

While he was being compared to
Dorsett, Davis claims that it is
another great back whom he favors.
“My favorite running back now is
Walter Payton,” stated Davis. While
it is at least 10 years too early to
compare their abilities, one can eas-
ily spot a similarity in their styles.

Panthers finish second

By Randy Miller
For The Pitt News

A foremost goal of Pitt men’s ten-
nis coach George Dieffenbach this
season was to better last year’s sixth
place finish in the Big East men’s
tennis championships.

Mission accomplished. The
Panthers did indeed best last sea-
son’s mark by finishing in a second
place tie with St. John’s this week-
end in Providence.

Pitt finished with 26 team points,
trailing only Boston College, who
won the -championship with 42
points. Connecticut finished fourth
(19), followed by Georgetown (l5),
Villanova (14), Providence (IO), and
Seton Hall (1). Syracuse, who does

not have a men’s tennis team, did not
compete in the tournament.

“We had tremendous improve-
ment this year,” said an elated Dief-
fenbach. “The Big East officials were
totally astonished by our play.”

Dieffenbach believed the strong
finish in the tournament attributes
to a combination of things.

“The older players have deve-
loped as they gained experience,”
Dieffenbach said. “We have a lot of
depth on this squad and have really
talented freshmen."

One freshman, Chris Peacock,
advanced to the finals in No. 1 sin-
gles before bowing to Stephen
Griffen of Boston College, 6-1, 6-3.
The Livingston, New Jersey native,
in his first college tournament upset

Junior College champion, in the first

TODAY...What happened
on the touchdown play that
beat Pitt on Saturday...see

page 9.

Davis stated that, “My running is
basically instincts," as he described
his spinning move that he put on two
BC defenders en route to his 26 yard
touchdown run. The move very
much resembles one of the many
that we have seen from Payton.

Along with his good instincts,
Davis also feels that his track expe-
rience aids in his running “a little
bit." Explaining why, he said,
“Track is supposed to keep you flex-
ible and I’m basically ’a flexible
person."

His instinctive twists and turns
netted 100 yards on 15 carries for
Davis resulting in an impressive 6.7
yard average. That's none too
shabby for a first outing. -

What impressed Davis about tha
first assignment was that on two
fourth down situations, it was he
upon whom the Panthers called. He
succeeded both on fourth-and-two
and fourth-and-one situations in
Pitt’s second touchdown drive.
“That gave confidence to me [being

Each school enters six players in
the singles tournament, with three
doubles teams. No Panther lost in
the opening round, and all Pitt dou-
bles teams earned a berth in the
finals. Two points are awarded for
each regular victory, with a consola-
tion win scoring a single team point.

Losing in the finals were Peacock
and Jeff Dadowski, Neil Meyero-
wich, Dave Johnson and the team of
Greg Campbell-Rich Monteleone.

“We knew we had the potential to
perform this well,” Dieffenbach
said. “The guys just believed in
themselves. They were really serious
about their tennis, and the hard
work they put into it paid off. We
certainly suprised a lot of people.”

years, only led 31-26 at the conclu-
sion of play on Saturday.

Boston College did hang on for
the title, but not before adetermined

their money, bringing home a

“To tell you the truth,” Dieffen-
bach stated, “our goal was to finish

But we tied them.”

tinued, “our goal is.to winthe tour-

big play    
kills
Panthers

By Bob Travers
Staff Writer

The Pitt Panthers brought back
some ugly memories of last season
on Saturday in a 29-22 upset loss at

the hands of the Eagles of Boston‘
College. With the loss Pitt’s record 4

falls to 1-2.

“I didn‘t think we played very
inspired fooball in the first half,”
Pitt head coach Foge Fazio said
after the game, “and that was our
downfall.”

The crowd of 40,922 was treated

to a Panther teamwith two person- -

alities. For two and a half quarters
Pitt played with all the gusto of an
anemic school girl, allowing a sus-
pect Boston College offense to roll
to a 2l-3 lead midway through the
third period.

It took the sparkling debut of 3.

freshman Brian Davis to finally
ignite the stagnate Panther attack. It

was a 26-yard Davis touchdown run «

that pulled the Panthers back into
the ballgame and set the stage for

two more Panther scores — a John .

Congemi dive from the two and a
looping pass to ﬂanker Chuck
Scales, who made a circus catch to
pull down the ball and put the
Panthers on top. The time remain-
ing when Scales put the Panthers up
22-21 was 4:1 l.

But then, as it did so often last
year, disaster struck. With 2:24 left,
BC had a crucial fourth and one
play. Eagle quarterback Shawn Hal-
loran faked a handoff and hit a
slanting Kelvin Martin in between
Teryl Austin and Troy Washington.
Martin avoided the tackle and went
untouched into the end zone for the
final score of the game. The call sur-
prised everyone but the BC offense.

“We worked on that play all week
in practice,” said Martin, “and today
it worked for us.”

“I _don't know how smart a foot-
ball team we are," Fazio said of the
final BC score, “but on that play we
weren't very intelligent." V

That play was a microcosm of a
problem that has plagued the Pan-
thers in all three games this year —
poor pass defense. “We have to start
to reevaluate the situation," is what

.Fazio said of the Pitt secondary.

Indeed, Halloran, who was in possi-
ble danger of losing his starting job
with another bad game, had the best
day of his career by far. Halloran"

finished the day 25 for 33 with 400 I

yards in the air.

“Shawn was sharp all day,"‘BC A

head coach Jack Bicknell said. “lt’s a

maturing process.” Bicknell added,

that the thing that pleased him most
was “being able to execute."
Halloran echoed his coach's senti-
ments when asked if he lost any con-
fidence when Pitt took a 22-21

nis and volleyball news.

 

Pitt-BC  

continued from page 7
fourth quarter lead. “No, we didn’t
lose any confidence because we were
doing what we wanted to offensively
all day,” stated Halloran. He added
that it was his opinion that “the Pitt
defense was tired by the end of the
first half.”

For Pitt in the end it was a case of
too little offense too late. In the first
half alone, Halloran had 255 yards
passing to Congemi’s 57. The Eagles
also controlled the ball in the first
half 19:30 to l0:30. In fairness to
Congemi, (who finished the day 9
for I9 and 128 yards) it must be

remembered that he was playing
with bruised ribs and a host of other
nagging injuries. He was replaced in
the game’s final series by backup
quarterback Joe Felitsky.

For Pitt the news was not all bad.
Sophomore Charles Gladman con-
tinues to impress. Against BC he
rushed for l2l yards on 17 carries
before leaving the game with a back
injury. He is expected to play next
week. And Brian Davis in his first
appearance in a Panther uniform

‘finished with 100 yards on 15 carries.

The status of quarterback John
Congemi was not determined as of
Sunday afternoon. Congemi left the
BC—Pitt game late in the fourth
quarter on Saturday.

called on]. The offensive line has
confidence in me, and I have confi-
dence in them.”

Of course, things weren't smooth
sailing from the outset. After his
initial thought of, “Hey, I'm in the
game. Let's see what I can do,"
Davis’ nerves started to get to him. It
got to the point where he vomited on
the sideline during the fourth
quarter.

The early success of both Glad-
man and Davis is going to raise the
obvious debate over playing time.
Both men have shown that they
desire to play. Coach Fazio made it
obvious that this is something that is
going to take alot of thought and
cannot be decided at this time. Glad-
man will (injury permitting) proba-
bly get a slight edge in the action
because of his experience, but per-
haps the Panthers are on the thresh-
old as another “Pony Exnress sim-

ilar to the recently graduated SMU
duo of Craig James and Eric Dicker-
son. Whatever the case, this sort of
“friendly competition" usually
results in a manner positive to the
team.

Davis welcomes the challenge.
“I’mjust here to help him make him-
self a better player. He's here to
make me a better ballplayer.”

Said Gladman,“It’s been competi-
tion the whole way.”’

Pitt's record now stands at 1-2.
With the performance of Davis on
Saturday, and Gladman’s perfor-
mance in all three games, the Pan-
thers look to improve on that

, record.

Gladman was banged up so bad
that he said, “It hurts to talk right
now.” But when asked if he would be
able to play next week, Gladman
replied, “I’ll be back.” It looks as
though the competition is paying off
already.

The Pitt News - September 23,1985.

Sport Talk

By Jim Urban

The TD-where were the defensive backs

It was a play that Foge Fazio will
see in his "sleep for a long while. It
was fourth and one at the Boston
College 49-yard line. Pitt just needed
to hold Boston College there, and
the game would be over. The
urgency of the situation was dictated
by the back-to-back timeouts that
were called, first by Boston College,
the second by Pitt.

Both teams came to the line of
scrimmage. Kelvin Martin was split
wide right, with Teryl Austin pro-
viding the coverage. Troy Washing-
ton stood in the middle ofthe field at
free safety, and Ducky Lewis was
playing right corner. The rest of the

_ defense was stacked at the line of

scrimmage.

Quarterback Shawn Halloran
took the snap, gave a great fake to
the back, then promptly dropped
back and fired a strike to Martin,
who was streaking across the field.
Martin caught the pass with Austin
on his heels, then turned on the
afterburners and outran Austin and
Washington, who blew the coverage

"o"n‘the-~ play to the end zone.

The play covered 51 yards. It was
good for six points and a Boston
College victory, their second against
two defeats. Eagle head coach Jack
Bicknell believed he caught the Pitt
team off guard.

“You do the unexpected when you
really think it has a chance,” said
Bicknell following the game. “If the
coaches guess right, you look good.
If they guess wrong...”

Pitt head coach Foge Fazio was
distraught over what happened. He
thought he had the correct defense
called, but it just wasn’t executed
properly.

“I don't know how smart of a
football team we are,” said Fazio.
“But on that last play that they
scored a touchdown on, we weren’t
very intelligent.” Fazio added, “Of
course, when you’re not, you are
going to get burned.”

Blair Capitano

Halloran’s eyes lit up when he

turned after faking the hand-off and
saw Washington coming in from the
safety position. That opened up the
middle for Martin.
’ “We changed the play two or three
times before settling on the last one,”
said Halloran. “I just wanted the
first down, but Kelvin made it
happenf’

“Shawn was sharp all day [com-
pleting 25 of 33 passes for 400
yards],” said Bicknell. “He’s more
confident now. It's been a maturing
process for him, but this is exactly
what the team needed. He stuck it
right on the money,” Bicknell added,
referring to the touchdown play.
“He was able to pull the trigger, then
Kelvin made the great catch.”

However, Martin should not have
made that catch, at least not without
paying the price.

“We told our guys to play a,three-
deep zone,” explained Fazio.
“Although the guy caught the ball,
there should have been a middle
safety sitting right there." Fazio
went on, “We were three-deep with
the corners on the outside, and we
were looking for a possible bootleg
or a drop pass to the tight end."
Fazio added, “The corner was clos-
ing in, but the middle safety should
have been right there.”

There were Pitt students, typical

' Pitt students at that, chanting, “Fire

Foge” as they headed back to the
fraternity houses next to the stadium
following the game. Fazio can call
the defense, but he can’t be expected
to make the plays, too. Pitt was in
the correct defense, but it was not
executed properly. Had Washing-
ton, the safety redshirt freshman
from Duquesne, been where he was
supposed to be, then maybe the pass
would not have been completed.
Was it Fazio who was called for
holding and_ illegal procedure penal-
ties in the first half — penalties that
resulted in third-and-long situations
and stalled Pitt drives? Fazio suf-

fered through a whole season -like
that last year and took all the heat._
He took it again on Saturday. -

“I told our squad, the team -‘was
not fired up,” said Fazio. “They were

not emotionally ready, and that’s my '

fault. I have to get them emotionally
ready.” Fazio noted, “I thought for
sure, when we got back to Pitts-
burgh we would be. [This week] we
have to go down to the [West Virgi-
nia] Mountaineers, and we better be
ready to go down there and play.”

Summing up the game, Fazio was
very frank. ~

‘‘I don't think we played very.

inspired football in the first half,”
said Fazio. “We have to play with a
lot of emotions, we have to play with
a lot of spirit, and we have to play
with confidence. We didn’t do that
in the first half. That was our down-
fall." Fazio added, “We just went
tlirough the motions, and when that

happens, you aren’t going to be very

good." . _
Of the holding penalties that ham-

pered Pitt in the first half, Fazio kept .

much the same attitude. .

“I was a little disappointed in all
the holding calls,” said Fazio. “We
had one holding call in two games,
then all of a sudden, we play an East-
ern team and we get all kinds of
holding calls.”'Fazio also pointed
out, “BC gets all kinds of holding
calls for two games, then they play
us and they have one.”

That’s what kind of a day it'was
for Pitt. Boston College caught them
at the right time. V"

“I’ve been coaching here five
years, and we’ve had some great
wins, but this was the most impor-
tant,” said Bicknell.-“This was the
best win we’ve ever had because we
were having problems this year.”

So the saga goes on. Pitt will play
West Virginia this weekend in a
game that can vault the Panthers to
success, or drop the Panthers into
another 1984 all over again.
