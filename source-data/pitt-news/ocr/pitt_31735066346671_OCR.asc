Two Hours Set
In Last Week

For Evaluation

Beginning with the spring

 

trimester, periods for review
and evaluation will be incor-
porated into the ﬁnal week
of each term.

Edison as-
sistant chancellor’ for planing,
announced last Friday that for
the spring trimester, the week will
be August 2 through August 8.

During that week each daytime
undergraduate class will meet for
one t.wo-hour period, which may

Montgomery,

be used for review, lecture, ex-
amination, discussion,
tion.

As soon as registration for the
spring trimester has been com-
pleted, a schedule of the hours
when each evaluation session will
meet will be planned. This sched-
ule shall be announced about
mid-way through the trimester.

The evaluation week will not
be included as part of anyigrad-
uate courses or any undergradu-
ate evening courses.

Plans for the evaluation week
came as a result of a study by an
administrative committee, consist-
ing of Richard Hodges, director of
the Office of Student Records, Al-
bert Martin, dean of the School of
Liberal Arts, Edison Montgom--'
ery, and Alan C. Rankin, assistant
chancellor of Student and General
Affairs.

The incorporation of ﬁnals week
into future trimester schedules
serves the dualpurpose of allow-
ing students to catch up on work
which they had neglected during
the term, and ensuring against
the possibility of a student hav-
ing more than two exams on any
one day.

For Spring Term;
More Than 1961

Approximately 916 students
have registered for the spring tri-
mester as of last Friday, accord-
ing to Anthony Athens, assistant
director of Student Records.

“This year’s amount is slightly
ahead of that for the same time
last year,” Athens said.

The breakdown of enrollment
by schools is: Liberal Arts, 312;
Education, 17; Engineering and
Mines, 511; Nursing, 22; General
Studies, 16; and Business Educa-
tion, 38. About 20 graduate stu-
dents have also registered.

Commenting on the number of

‘students registered for the cur-

rent trimester, Athens stated that
there has been a slight rise over
the enrollment of the winter tri-

niester last year. “We do not have

a completed list of the number
enrolled at present, but it will be
slightly greater than last year’s,”
he said.

 

New Student
Political Party
Gives SC Slate

By MATT SWETONIC A
A brand new political party has
been formulated in time for the
Student Government elections to
be held March 7.

The organization will be known
asthe Representative Party and
will attempt to “bring a fresh ap-
proach to SG,” by selecting for
the party slate a group of indi-
viduals who “were chosen for
their proven efficiency rather than
solely for their popularity,” stat-
ed a spokesman of the new party.

Dr. Cottam and Dr. Schulman of
the Political Science Department
here at the University have
agreed to be faculty sponsors for
the political organization.

Olofson Runs

The candidate of the Represen-
tative Party for president of SG
is Tom Olofson, and Judy De-
Thorn is the candidate for vice-
president.

According to Olofson. a junior
in Business administration “SG
can certainly be an asset to stu-
dents, faculty and the adminis-
tration. Through SG a system
of two-way communication be-
tween these groups can be set
up to increase coordination.”

Judy DeThorn was unavailable
for comment.

Deadline Extended

In other phases of the pre-elec-
tion preparations, the deadline for
petitions for individual and party.

Dr. William H. E. Johnson,
chairman of the Foundations of
Education Department at the Uni-
versity will‘ speak to a supper
meeting of the Samovar Club of
Aliquippa High School Sunday at
6 p.m. in the American Serbian
club, Aliquippa, on “The Soviet
I Saw,” a summary of his ob-
servations while in the Soviet Un-
Ion.

The Samovar Club, a group
consisting of 45 tenth, eleventh,
and twelfth graders of Aliquippa
High School, is aimed at broad-
ening the students understand-
ing of Russian culture and cus-
toms through programs of Rus-
sian music, films. and other ac-
tivities.

It is, according to Dr. John-
son, an illutsration of the grow-
ing interest in America in Rus-
sian language and culture on
the secondary school level.

Dr. Johnson was chief of the
llussian political department in
U. S. Military Intelligence during

Future Finders

For graduatingﬂseniors the University Placement Serv-
ice has become one of the most popular gathering places.
But for the underclassl majority placement offices remain
a mysterious entity somewhere on the second floor SU.'The
work done in the 10 small interviewing rooms and three
main ofﬁces, however, deserves much greater consideration
than is usually given. ‘ ,

Last year alone more than 500 ﬁrms of national repu-
tation interviewed on campus. As a result some 738 men
and women gained professional help in launching their
careers. A L I

Headed by Dr. Walter Ritenour, the placement team
devotes itself to a year—round service arranging interviews
between. students and prospective employers, maintaining
up-to—date recordsin a central office, holding career con-
ferences, following the progress of alumni and keepingclose
tab on general employment trends. _

Although it deals primarily ‘with graduates of the
schools of Liberal Arts, Business Administration and Engi-
neering as. well as various graduate programs, the Place-
ment Service will consider all students with no fees charged
to either registrant or employer.

It has been estimated that- the 891 graduates handled
yearly through the Alumni Division has saved students well
over $40,000 in employment agency fees. _

Such an impressive record cannot be easily dismissed.
Even were the results not considered, the amount. of time
required to handle ultimately 4500 students in four years
or 1100 students each year is phenomenal, especially when
the majority of those contacts are made in the four month
period between January and April.

Any students who do not yet know of the work of the
Placement Service, especially those underclassmen who
will graduate within the next year should take advantage
of the ﬁne work being done in this area.’

Reasons For Revolution

By Alberto Sichel--——‘

       

__,...-

Latin American countries are often, if not al-
ways, referred to as underdeveloped countries
where misery, illiteracy and revolutions predomi-
nate. Why should this be the case? What has
taken them so long to begin to solve their state
of instability and shame? ~ 

“Dictatorships!” This word
reminds Latins of oppression,
dishonesty and regression. Op-
pression, because during dicta-
torships there has been no free-
dom of expression at all, and the
masses of poor people have been
forced to work at. the command
of the government and upper
classes with little or no material
beneﬁt.

Dishonestly, because the government officials,
along with many upper class people, have used
the public treasury of the country to become rich;
and, in so doing, the money which should have
been delegated for public works to reduce the. mis-
ery and illiteracy of the the people has been rob-
bed by this minority, leaving the countries in eco-
nomic, moral and spiritual-debt. So hatred, revenge
and desire for liberty has driven the poor classes,
blindfolded, to follow the leadersof revolution,
only to ﬁnd, as most historic occasions prove, that
they have [helped a new group of selﬁsh people to

 

-come into power, thus repeating the same old

story of dictatorship.

Minority Exploits Farmers
A second case is found in the landowner. tra-

« dition, which has hurt immensely the development

of Latin countries since most of the land is owned
by the rich minority..Through the years, this mi-'
mority has exploited the poor farmer and his
family, even to the extent of using all his children
as free helping hands in the ﬁelds, depriving them
of the right to an education and treating them
more as servants or slavesthan human beings.

  

Castro came into the picture in 1959. He stat-
ed that the revolution had just begun and promis‘:
ed the masses equality and agrarian reform, a
new life for the people, “a future.” He went on
to conﬁscate the land owned by wealthy Cubans
and to seize all the American property in Cuba;
he did not stop there but successfully used the
U.S. as a scapegoat to justify his revolutionary
method. It would be easy, therefore, to’ understand
why the masses have followed Castro’s movement
as the way to their salvation and have praised him
as their idol.

Fidel, no matter how much a menace he may
be, has opened the eyes of both the Latin Ameri.
can countries and the U.S. to reality. The privileg-
ed minority is realizing fast that the old easy way



of oppression of the masses is coming to an end; 

that no matter how hard they ﬁght""to préve_nt
agrarian reform, it is a reality and will take place;

that the education of the people is a necessity and‘ i

must be a major goal; above all, that these rights
are either granted to the masses or—the danger of
another Cuba is iminent in Latin America. A
Working Toward Industrialization

4

As for today, some of the Latin countries, after

exiling their dictators and cabinet members, have
acquired democratic types of government which
are working toward industrializing, educating and
administering their countries with honesty, to-
ward the goal of a safe and prosperousfuture. They

' 1
,4-

have encountered, however, enormous problems in '

their programs; economic debt, Castro followers,
and a wealthy minority still opposed to the idea

' of equalit.y.

Settling these problems will take time. But so
long as the privileged classes are ready to help, so
long ‘as the governments continue to develop the
democratic ideals of social responsibility and hon-
esty, education and land reform will become a
reality. In the long run, this should help to bring
to all the people equality, prosperity and peace.

Transplanted Trees

Culture

Cauﬁon 

Just to be sure, I looked it up in the dictionary.
I’ was right, too. Webster still. defines a minstrelz
“One of a troup of musical’ performers and come-
dians, of a kind originating in the early, 19th Cen-
tury in the United States, typically, giving a pro-
gram of Negro melodies, jokes,
and impersonations, and usually
blacked in imitation of Negroes.”
Wait! Be it known that I, nor
Webster as far as I know, have
anything against any of the
above institutions mentioned.
Just a place to begin what I
think is an unfortunate trend, if
I may venture my views on
trends as I think I see them.

I can remember one bright spot in my high
school days. They had an annual thing they put
on in a theater downtown which was called a
minstrel. It was the only thing in the whole year
that really uniﬁed the student body — from foot-
ball players to Classical Club members.7 Boys who
couldn’t sing sang solos with their faces painted
black above horrible striped tails and gstiﬁ collars
on the same stage that had held an opera star
who could sing the night before. The audience
loved them.

Bye-Bye Minstrels

Then, out of the blue, somebody, no one seems
to know who, felt that somebody was being in-
sulted‘ by our minstrel. Or, not that they were, but
that they might be — or something. All kind of
vague. So the black paint was put back_in the
jars to stay, and the minstrel isn’t having min-
strels any more. i

This, in my radical little mind, is silly. It seems
that all of a sudden somebody just might get in-
sulted and there »might be trouble and we don't
want trouble and even though we have never in-
sultedanyone in the past we might this year. This
is carrying something to an extreme. What are
these people thinking about? Just because there
has been a movement for needed integration for
the past few years that’we should not sing any-
thing that Stephen Foster wrote because he used
plantation lingo ' and Negroes sang his songs? In
George Orwell’s “I984” the government employ-
ed thousandsto keep the records up to date. Keep-

“in” bute“out” as far as their political thoughts
were concerned, and in place of their names, put-
ting all the current heroes names "and pictures.

The Minstrel, is an -early form of today’s mu-
sical comedy, and although it is a little out.of
date, the lost art of the minstrel is still amusing.
When it is considered as a rich heritage, it is a
form of art as much as Shakespeare. But con-
sidered as a form of prejudice, speciﬁcally pointed
to insult somebody, it does.

-~ It really embarrasses me that someone is stupid
enough to form the second conclusion. Someone is
trying to get rid of something for the point of get-
ting rid of it. They’ve jumped on the band wagon
and. by God, come hell or high water they can’t

WALTER W. KOLAR. Director

 

By SUSANNE ECKIVIAN and
BARRY GROSS
This evening at 8:30, in 11'
CL, students and faculty have
an opportunity to see an im-
maturely written ﬁrst play
by a newcomer and an abrupt

comedy by playwright Sean
O’Casey.

“Nine Sons in a Row" comes
ﬁrst in the Theatre 11 double-

play when he was sixteen years
old.

The social director of a Cats-
kills summer resort and the girl
he loves, who has “worked” her
way through college, go through
a conglomeration of trials during
which humor and pathos often be-
come confused.

Petley Lacks Conviction
As director, Herbert Petley act-
ed too matter-of-fact and was
rarely, convincing.

Gil Lazier took full advantage

of a hefty part in his portrayal
of the cynical and untalented
“Sonny,” although the written
characterization is somewhat.
disjointed.

Linda Previtt carries her melo-
dramatic part effectively. As a
deadpan drummer and a thick-
skinned pianist, Bill Power and
Jeff Rash are perfect. Larry Hell-
er’s accent makes him seem an
Irish Jew.

Play Moves Quickly

Bill Kingsley and Raisha Sil-
berman as the leads in O’Casey’s
“Bedtime Story” started the play
off at a rapid pace, and it con-
tinued comically, superbly, and
very “Irishly” until the two part-
ed.

From then on the story de-\
generated, as plot incidents were
exaggerated until a very abrupt
end.

Gloria Engel portrays the land-
lady with a thick orogue and
slow, comic mannerism. Jeffrey
Rash, as the friend of the pious
soul who has secretly been with
a woman, allows ‘saccent to
lapse at times. The nurse and
doctor, Myra Lewinter and Cliﬁ°

been enough publicity nor enough
time for prospective candidates
to turn in their petitions.

Secondly, the Dean of Men’s
and the Dean of Women’s of-
fices have not been able to
check the QPA’s of the candi-
dates accurately since erased G
and F grades have not as ye_t__
been removed from the records.

The Senate passed that in any
future SG election or referendum,
the ballots will be kept for two
weeks in case a recount is desir-
ed. This would require a petition
of 10 percent of the voting stu-
dents. If there is no such action
within two weeks, then the bal-

lots will be destroyed and the re-

sults counted as ﬁnal.

The Senate voted to give
WPGH $300 to install a coaxial
cable so that every dormitory in
the quadrangle will be able to
receive the station’s frequency at
full strength. Richard Rauh, Gen-
eral Manager of WPGH, thanlied
the Senate for the money and
said, “We will put it to excellent
use. We intend to get to every
dorm, every room, so every stu-
dent can pick us up.” Cost of the
cable is $140; the rest of the
money will go for installation.
WPGH will submit a ﬁnal ﬁnan-
cial report to the Senate.

Jay Fingeret announced that
Bernice Kimmel has set up the
Book Exchange Committee.
“Since there is such a poor se-
lectioli of classes for the spring
trimester, there are few winter
term courses that are being re-
peated. This is a problem con-
sidering that the Book Exchange
sells books from the previous
semester in the next one.”

Fin-geret said that Miss Kimmel
will go through the catalog and
ﬁnd out how many courses will
be repeated in the spring. If
there are not enough to warrant
operation of the Book Exchange,
its activity will be postponed un-
til fall.

President Richard Sobota an-
nounced that the Alcohol Com-
mittee has received 16 replies to
the inquiries sent. to various
schools about their handling of the
alcohol problem. The committee
will meet at 7:30 p.m. on March
16 and submit a formal report to
Dr. Rankin no later than March
22. Bob Slotkin reported that IFC
has prepared a special report to
be presented at the committee
meeting.

WHAT BREEDS LOSSES?

Complete adaptation to environment means death. The essential point in all
1‘eSp(m~-‘e is the desire to control environment. -- John Dewey.

: The Dayton Flyers are one of the perennial powers in
the high-strung world of college basketball. Yet if the Fly-
ers’ wings are clipped in mid-air, a mummy-like ﬁgure can
usually be seen swaying at tree-top level on the Ohio college
campus.

It's a papier macho reproduction of Dayton’s coach, Tom Black-
bunr. Blackburn has gotten fed up with these too-frequent noose par-
ties. He has good cause for being upset. After all, Dayton has been
runner—up in the NIT post-season tournament five times in the last
decade, and they have a winning record all the time. A

Blackburn blasted the students in a- front-page story in the local
newspaper, saying, in eﬁect, that.the students‘ had a negative atti-
tude, the team had a negative attitude, and if the team was.playing
badly, “it’s just the kind of team that the students deserve.” He also
wanted to knowpwhy the football’ coach wasn’t hung in effigy for his
sterling 2-8 record. ”

At Pitt, football coach, John Michelosen, has been hung at half
mast on a few occasions, but the other coaches are completely ig-
nored by the vengeful sadists. If basketball coach Bob Timmons was
ever hung in eﬂigy, it would mark a step forward in'the sport on
this campus. It would unveil a new interest in the sport.

The Panther cagers are going to have another iwiuning season

this year, that is, they will be above the .500 mark. We should not
have tipped the balance scales so slightly. This year’s basketball
team, ﬁve sophomores or not. should have been a consistent winner.

The coach, traditionally, is always the scapegoat. We can’t really
put the ﬁnger of blame on anyone, not having extlra-sensory powers
of perception, but the shadow of guilt falls on both the coach and
the players. a .

Week after week, Timmons says “well you can give so-and—so
his 30 points, but it was Sam Schmedley who killed us with his 15
points. You don’t expect that.” If some unknown throws a wrench

in pre-game plans so consistently, wouldn’t it be logical to try and‘

cut so-and—so’s production rate, and allow for Schmedley starring
once. , A S
A Week after week, Pitt faces a zone defense. As a coach, don’t
‘ you devise some strategy to crack the set-up. Every game the
"Panthers strive to get the other team out of a zone defense, be-
cause Pitt supposedly plays better against a man-to-man defense.

Against Westminster, Pittwas hitting. from outside and succeed-
ed in_ prying the Titans out of their zone. Then Pitt was befuddled.
“We’re so used to seeing a zone,” Timmons explains. “that we" didn't
know how to play against a man-.for—man defense. So we just stood
around, still looking for the outside shot.”

Doesn’t this statement betray logic? Why do you drive them out

of a zone, if you can’t play man-for-man? Why can‘t you play man-
for-man? _ J ‘ '
I There is a theory held by one ultra—successtul basketball coach
at Wittenburg, last year’.-, NCAA small-college champs, that a coach
who can’t crack a zone defense will not teach it to his own players
because he doesn’t want to popularize the strategy.

Then Pitt loses to a l\-Tiami. of Ohio ballclub, that has been a patsy
for everyone. Everybody else used a zone to beat the Redskins. They
had a fella named Vern Benson who nobody short of lvlercury could
have stayed with, and still Pitt played him one-for—one.

“That’s‘what we play best,” Timmonsexplains. “Wedon’t know
enough about the zone (that’s enlightening) to use it effectively. We
like to play an improvised defense (as well as offense) and assign
-individual responsibility.” _ I _

Then, on the following night, he uses’ a zone against Temple
and‘ wins, even though it was a ragged zone. 7

A few more questions are raised. Why doesn’t the team know
how to play a zone? Does it really help a boy to have responsibil-
ity for an enemy player? Does it bolster hustling Tim Grgurich’s
morale when Rod Thorn and Benson score 26 and 31 points against”
him respectively? ‘ ' c

These doubtful assertion leave a fan wondering, but so do
the players themselves. The Panthers had some good young talent,
high school phenoms cultivated in winning basketball. Then they be-
gan to lose here. The coach admitted that he couldn’t get the team
“up” for a game.

What’s happened to the image of sophomore enthusiasm? Fresh
in the ranks, and they need pep talks to generate a ﬁghting spirit?
Nonsense! Pride in their own work is motivation enough, pride in
their school is a must.

But how can they really have pride in their school‘! Sure. they
haven’t been burning up the basketball ranks, and they’re not go-

 

 

 

 
 

Successful Swimmers   Splash

A

McConnell Picked To Win Free Exercise

EIGL Meet At, Army.

By SANDY RESNICK
The 35th Annual Eastern Intercollegiate Gymanstic
League Individual Championships will be held at the United
States Military Academy at West Point, New York, Friday
and Saturday. Army, 1962 ELGL team champions, will play

host to eleven teams.

Competing with Army, Navy, Syracuse, Pitt, Temple,
and Penn State will be guest teams Springﬁeld, Boston,
Southern Connecticut, West Virginia, and Massachusetts. Al-
though the participants travel in teams,_ all honors are award-

ed on an individual basis. 6

Winners are determined by add-
ing scores received in a prelim-
inary contest Friday night and
scores received _  
in the ﬁnal. 
c 0 m p e t i t ion
Saturday after-
noon. T h i s
method is used
because it ena-
bles a consist-
ant performer
to prove him-
self‘.

T e n events
will challenge ‘ '
the best gym- E. McConnell
nasts in the East plus the all in-
clusive all-around event. Along
with the six Olympic divisions of
side horse, parallel bars, free ex-
ercise, horizontal bar, still rings,
and long horse, there will be ﬂy-
ing rings, tumbling, rope climb,
and trampoline.

Pitt’s Earl McConnell is a fav-
orite to take the first place
medal in free exercise. His
nearest rivals will be Tom Se-
ward of Penn State and Corky
Voas of Syracuse. Seward,
EIGL defending free exercise
champ, suffered his only loss of
the season to McConnell. In
Pitt’siﬁrst meet of the season,‘
Voa.s bowed to McConnell 263-

completed the season unde-
feated.

\ ~Another possible Panther win-

ner may be long horse ace Bob.

Pingatore. Pingatore will have the
opportunity to show his ability
against last year's EIGL long
horse champ Greg Weiss of Penn
State and Ron Orlick of Syracuse.
IIa.ven’t Met Yet I

Weiss and Pingatore did not
compete against each other this
season; Orlick and Pingatore did.
Both men had comparatively low
scores, but Orlick edged Pinga—
tore 240-227. Against Penn State,
Orlick baggd a 280 while Pinga-
tore scored 270., I »

Again, Weiss will be the man
to beat in the horizontal bar event.
He also claims this EIGL title. Ed
Zamecnik, Panther junior, will at-
tempt to relieve Weiss of this hon-
or. Zamecnik has been the num-
ber one man on Pitt’s high bar
trio. —

Zamecnik will also be after
Weiss’ all-around division crown.
Seward is not to be overlooked in
this event either. Last year
Zamecnik had to settle for a third
place in the all—around competi-
tion because Seward ’was too
tough.

16 win over Slippery Rock on Sat- ‘
urday makes the outlook much
brighter for a victory.

‘ Coach. Carl Rees is not sure
what to think after the Slippery
Rock meet. “Because Slippery
Rock was so bad I’m not sure
what to think,” he commented. “If

our distance men come along we I

have a real good chance,” he con-
tinued.

Following along the same
lines, he stated, “Our distance
men and sprinters looked great
this past weekend. Tarkany in
the two mile, Mocnik and Ro-
binson in the mile and Hart in
the 1000 all turned in their best

i times. And Shanafett did a 5.4

in the 50.”

Joe Friend has been the Pan-
ther’s most consistent winner. On
Saturday he captured. the high
hurdles and helpedwin the mile
relay. This Saturday he will prob-
ably compete in both the high
and low hurdles and the broad
jump.

Vance Carter is Pitt’s only
other undefeated runner this sea-
son. He is expected to run the
880. This and the 440 replaces the
600 and 1000 yard run.

shattered the old record in the

will return home with more wins
than last year’s team, as they at-
ready own seven victories. The

six meets.

The most encouraging aspect of
the water campaign has been the
sterling performances recorded by
the sophomore members of the
team. Most of therecord setting
has been done by newcomers, and
if they are already better than
the oldtimers, there is no telling
what the future holds for the

By ART FLEISCIINER
Pitt’s basketball team ﬁnished the season with a 12-11

record, and while it is nothin
thing of which the school can
there were ﬁve sophomores in
experience was not disastrous.

Although there was some

tournament hid, it was evident‘.

that this year’s club was not
ready for it. A frequent expres-
sion spoken by sport’s editor is,
“They’re still a

year or t w o
a w a y.” This
certainly ‘a p-
plies to t h e

U n i v e r s 1-
ty’s hoop squad.
C o a c h Bob
Timmons com-
menting on this
y e a r ’ s team a
said, “I ‘have.
never seen a R 1
real g re at Bob Timmons
sophomore club. You don’t win
ball games, you lose them by mis-
takes. I am pleased that we had
at winning season and at least did
as well as last year’s club.”
Green This Year ’
‘He. continued with the usual,
"They were green this year and
PH exepct. more next season.” The
Panthers will be playing approxi-
mately the same teams next year
and as most were senior dominat-
ed squads, Pitt should be able to
capitalize. .
Timmons, who ﬁnished his
ninth year of basketball coach-
ing at Pitt has a 113-108 record,
a lifetime mark that corresponds
closely with the last two sea-
sons.

In comparing his two clubs of
the past two year’s, Timmons re-
marked, “This year’s team had
better spirit. They never got beat

 

g to boast about, it is some-
be proud. At times this year
the lineup; however, the in-

talk of a possible post-season

real bad and were always in the

game until the end. The boys had

more desire. And of

much better bench.”
Team Developed

Although it was not evident in
the loss to Penn State to close
out the season, thr Panthers did
develop. According to the Pitt
mentor, “The boys came along,
but I. was a little disappointed to-
ward the end of the season. Like
all sophomore teams this club was
inconsistent.”

He followed this by the deﬁ-

nition of a sophomore, "A soph-
omore is a wise,.fool.” This again
was typical _ of the team /this
year.
i>Their ‘wins over Westminster
and Temple at the Field House
and their loss to Miami of Ohio
at the same place bears this out.
It is likely that the squad has
gained the valuable experience
that differentiates. the good team
from the great one, but this can
only be proven at this same time
next year.

Thus next season should prove
very interesting if: some varsity
ballplayers who didn‘t see action
this year are able to help, if
thm. some help from this sea-
so-n’s freshman club, and if the
toys who will be returning vet-
erans next season have proﬁted
from their mistakes this year.

Rich Martin Only Second  
Matman T oF inish Unbeaten

Martin Leads Matmen
To Successful Season

By BOB SIVIIZIK
There were many outstanding individual performances
during the 1962 wrestling season, but none can surpass the

third straight undefeated sea
thers’ 123 pounder.

By ﬁnishing his dual meet
career with a 25-0 mark, the
“little guy” thus joins Ed Peery
as the only Panther wrestler to
accomplish the feat. This ‘record is
all the more outstanding when it
is realized that such greats as
Hugh Peery and Larry Lauchle
were unable to accomplish it.

Perhaps the most amazing
aspect of Martin’s record is the
-fact that he was rarely pressed to
win. On many occassions his op-
ponents were happy to avoid a
pin, realizing that they had little
chance to win-

Step Bel ‘nd

Only a step behind the record
made by Martin is the one that
John Zolikoff chalked up at Pitt
during his career. Zolikoff joins
Lauchle and Hugh Peery as grap-
plers that have lost but one
match.

Zolikoff came within five sec-
onds of matching Ed Peery and
_Martin. Against Army’s Mike

son by Rich Martin, the Pan-

Natvig last year, Zolikoff led
with ﬁve seconds when he was
pinned.

Junior Jim Harrison came
through with his ﬁrst undefeaaed
season in compiling an 8-O-1
mark. Sophomore Ken Barr also

two pins. Harrison was second
with 28 points on seven decisions,
a pin and a draw.
Daryl Kelvington had the
most shutouts, with four. Mar-
tin and Jeffries led in pins with

two apiece.

If the number of points gisin
up is any indication then Barr is
the team’s best defensive wrestler.
Ken gave up only eight points‘ in
the same number of matches.

Harrison was second in this cate- a

gory, giving up 12 points in nine
outings.

Offensively Martin again led the
team by scoring 52 points, even
though two of his matches were
cut short due to pins. Zolikoff had
42 points in eight matches and
Kelvington scored 43 in nine tests.

Nine meets saw the team en-
gage in 78 matches and come out
with a 51-20-7 record.
