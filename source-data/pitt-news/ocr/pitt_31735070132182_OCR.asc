VOLUME XCVIII, NUMBER 102

37 sick  
on CMU
Campus

KATIE LEONARD
Assistant News Editor

Food seems to have been eliminated as
the source of the recent health scare at near-
by Carnegie Mellon University; however,
oﬂicials still haven’t been able to identify the
actual cause. ‘

 "  According to Guillermo Cole, a

spokesman for the Allegheny County
Health Department, after  to 27 of the
35 patients, ofﬁcials have found no common
linkasto whereorwhatthey allateoreven
a common place that they all were at.

“We don’t suspect food as the culprit
here,” he said.

The only apparent common ground is
that they were all on CMU’s campus, but
ﬂratis aratherlarge areaforanillnesstobe
spread out, he added. '

Starting on Thursday evening between
9 and 10 p.m., students started reporting
feeling ill, according to Cole. Throughout
the night, seven people went to UPMC
Presbyterian Hospital’s emergency room
since the student health services department
was closed No one needed to be hospital-
’ because of his or her symptoms, h
said. ~

People continued to report intestinal
problems until Saturday. Problems reported
included nausea, vomiting, stomach cramps
and diarrhea. Some people also had a fever.

According to Anita Bostj ancic, an
administrative manager for Pitt’s student
health services, Pitt students have not been
aﬂected by this ongoing problem.

The health department is currently wait-
ing for results from testing to ﬁnd out more
information about the cause of the illnesses.
According to Cole, the results should be in
during the next day or so. , '

Punxsutawney Groundhog Club President Bill ‘Cooper (right) reads Phil
the Groundhog’s prediction of six more weeks of winter.

Groundhog Day, again

MICHAEL MASTROIANNI
The Pitt News

Punxsutawney, a small communi-
ty 80 miles northeast of Pittsburgh, is
a town that is connected to the world
through one day: Feb. 2, Groundhog
Day.

Apparently, the second half of
winter is decided by a furry marrnot
in the middle of rural Pennsylvania. ’

Why a groundhog, anyway?

It ‘goes back to the times of the
Roman Empire, and the Christian cel-
ebration of Candlemas, the day of rit-
ual puriﬁcation for 40 days after the
birth of Jesus Christ. The coming of
spring was predicted by the emer-
gence of hibernating animals. Bears,
badgers and hedgehogs held the
lucrative position of forecaster, but as
the tradition made its way into
America, groundhogs were chosen as
t the honored mammal.

A story in the Feb. 2, 1886 edition
of “The Punxsutawney Spirit” by the
editor Clymer Freas, ‘announcing that

“at the time of this printing, the
groundhog had not seen his shadow,”
began one of the most intense and
successful .public interest campaigns‘
in history, bringing national fame to
the unknown Pennsylvania‘ hamlet,
designating Phil the groundhog as the
official forecaster. Since then, Phil

has lobbied for an end to prohibition

in the 1930s, visited the White House
and predictedthe results of baseball
seasons. The 1993 film “Groundhog
Day,” starring Bill Murray, brought
even more interest. More than 10,000
people -attended the ceremony last
year, the 117th celebration of Phil’s
emergence. , S

A 1l8—year-old groundhog? 4

“At least that old,”. according to
William ‘Deeley, Phil’s handler of 14
years. “We don’t know what his pro-
fession was before prognosticating.”

Claiming that Phil is as-native to
Punxsutawney as anyone else, Deeley
said, “[The town] didn’t inherit Phil;

Blind man

A reaches peak

LORA WooDwARD-
Staff Writer

Outdoor enthusiasts staggered into
the David Lawrence Hall Auditorium
bundled inside parkas and overcoats to
watch 33-year-old Erik Weihenmayer, a
blind man, climb tothe highest point on
earth. I

“Farther than the Eye Can See,” a V

documentary of the ﬁrst blind man to
climb Mount Everest, had its Pittsburgh
premiere last Friday night. The Explorers

_ Club of Pittsburgh hosted the event.

Dan Rossi, a partially blind climber,
who went to Everest’s base camp with
Weihemnayer, spoke ﬁrst. ,

“[This feature] raises the stakes for
the public as far as what blind people can
do,” said Rossi, a member of the
Explorers Club, who then introduced
guest speaker Jeff Evans. ‘

“When you team up with a blind per-

son, it is almost like being a part of the

Jamaican bobsled team — people don’t
respect you right away,” said Evans, a
member of Weihenmayer’s summit team
who has climbed with Weihenmayer for a
decade. S

Evans described his ﬁrst climb with
Weihemnayer, on Mt. McKinley. When
they reached the summit, a plane circled
around them, documenting the historic
event.

“You think they will know who I
am?” Weihenmayer asked Evans.

“Yeah, man, ' you’re the only one
waving in the wrong direction,” Evans
said he replied. Jokes like this set the tone
for the lighthearted evening.

deﬁnition video format,

the age of three with retinoschisis, a rare
genetic disease that caused him to go
completely blind at 13. Weihenmayer’s
dream to climb Everest began after read-

Patients feeling better

Since there appears to’ be no common
food cause or other known source of the ill-
ness, though, the health department is not
issuing any special precautions.

Except fortwo of the 35 people who fell
ill, all were students. The two nonstudents
were CMU staﬁ‘ workers.

A Pennsylvania Department of Health
spokesman directed questions to the county
health department.

As of Monday, everyone contacted by
the health department was either fully recov-
ered or getting better, Cole said.

Anita Barkin, CMU’s director of health
services, said people should L wash their
hands well to avoid getting infected ‘by the.
virus or bacteria that is causing these illness-
es.

 
   

In Monday’s The Pitt News’ “Engineering men get all spruced up,” it was incor-

THE PITT N1-zws

Groundhog Phil predicts MAT R°‘.;5‘?..

six more weeks of winter

Groundhog, page 1

Phil inherited us.”

At four in the morning, no one
could guess the ensuing celebration
from the sight of Punxsutawney
itself. The borough was just as quiet
and dark as any other. Soon, the lights
of state police cruisers appeared
before me, reminding me more of a
highway accident than a" town holi-
day. __ 
At Gobbler’s Knob, Phil’s hang-
out just south of the town limit, jour-
nalists from across the country had
already picked spots for their cameras
and microphones. The frozen breath
of thousands of people standing in a
17-degree chill became a vaporous
haze over the stadium lights and tele-
vision vans. After a couple hours of
bad karaoke from the stage where
Phil’s burrow stood, a grand display
of fireworks lit up the sky above the
wilderness to John Williams’ scores

‘to “Star Wars” and “Superman.”

As the time got closer to 7:25
a.m., the media and the audience
began to converge on the stage, push-
ing to‘ get closer to the spot where
Phil apparently -slept through the

racket. Bill Cooper, president of the
Punxsutawney Groundhog Club,
knocked on the -door with his cane.
Deeley then reached in, emerging tri-
umphantly with Phil, the victim of a
rude awakening, in his outstretched
hand.

 The audience cheered and chant-
ed Phil’s name as Cooper chatted
with the groundhog and finally
announced that Phil had seen his
shadow and six more weeks of winter
would follow. The audience groaned
but kept their bright demeanor as they
lined up to be photographed with the
star of the show.

Nearly all small towns have an
event that defines them, setting them
apart from the hundreds of thousands
of others that seem all alike: the swal-
lows’ return to San Juan Capistrano,
Calif.; a festival for the cherry in
Traverse City, Mich.; or the moon
bow in Cumberland Falls, Ky.
Whether asking a groundhog about
the weather seems silly or not, it is
the life of Punxsutawney year round,
and they are happy to share it with the
World on this day.

Bundle up, Pittsburgh. More win-
ter is coming.

Partners make noise to help

Everest, page 1
ing climbing books in Braille.

“Dude, you want to climb Mount
Everest?” geophysicist Pasquale

Scaturro, :who had already climbed
Everest, asked Weihemnayer one day.

“Yeah, dude,” he responded.

The National Federation of the Blind,
whose main goal is to demystify the pub-
lic’s perception of blindness, funded
Weihenmayer’s expedition. The company
that produces Allegra, an allergy medi-
cine, sponsored the documentary.

Hiking to base camp with a pole in
each hand, Weihenmayer listened as his
partners rang bells and shouted com-
mands to direct him.

“That was a walk in the park,” said
Weihenmayer when he reached Everest’s
base camp at 17,500 feet. “You act like it
was some kind of big deal» or something.”

The feature reﬂects Weihemnayer’s
good spirits and sense. of humor, as
Everest looms white and ominous in the
distance.

“It’s amazing how hard Erik
[Weihenmayer] pushes himself,” one
expedition partner said.

In the last 50 years, about 1,000 peo-

ple have ‘reached the top of Mt. Everest,
Weihenmayer said, but the mountain has
taken about 200 lives. The team spent a

month and a half acclimating and prepar- '

ing for the trek.

V Dressed in a puffy, red suit on sum-
mit day, with hardly any skin showing,
Weihenmayer and his teammates started
the climb to the top. Leaving Camp IV at
26,300 feet in the middle of the night, the
team climbed through strong winds and
snow.

“Mount Everest is a place where
there is absolutely no room for error,” one
climber said. Team members at base
camp told the group to keep moving,
because they would have good weather
within the hour. The team reached the
summit on May 24,2001, surrounded by
blue skies.

“You’re on top of the world,” one
climber said to Weihenmayer.

An achievement like Weihenmayer’s
takes people’s perceptions and shatters
them, one member of his team said. But
his fellow climbers didn’t see him so dif-
ferently. “Erik [Weihenmayer] was just
another climber on the mountain,” Evans
said during the question and answer time
after the feature. ’

Check out that malfunctioning wardrobe

Short of hiding under a rock or
going on a complete media fast, it’s
been impossible to escape news of
Janet Jackson’s and Justin
Timberlake’s Super Bowl halftime hi-
jinks.

During the song, “Rock Your
Body,” at the lyrical moment
Timberlake sang, “I’m gonna have you
naked by the end of this song,”
Timberlake ripped off part of
Jackson’s top — specifically, the part
covering her right breast, complete
with large, silver, sun-shaped nipple
ornament. The action put her breast on
display‘ for the entire halftime audi-
ence to see. Granted, on television, it
looked more like a pasty, fully cover-
ing her nipple, but still shots later con-
ﬁrmed that her nipple was quite visi-
ble.

It’s possible to believe that CBS
and maybe MTV had no idea
Jackson’s breast would be making an
appearance — after all, CBS was too
timid to run a spot criticizing the pres-
ident. However, it seemed that
Timberlake and Jackson were fully
aware of what they were planning,
without a doubt. Timberlake’s timing
in relation to his lyrics, along with
Jackson’s interesting clothing choices
and ecstatic facial expression after the
revelation make it clear that the two
were in cahoots.

In a hilarious and charmingly use-

less bit of butt-covering and" double-
speak, Timberlake referred to the inci-
dent as a “wardrobe malfunction.”

, Right.

Timberlake and MTV, which pro-
duced the segment for CBS, insist the
incident was not planned, and CBS
“deeply regrets the incident,” accord-
ing to spokesperson LeslieAnne Wade.

The Federal Communications
Committee will be launching an inves-
tigation into the incident. Under cur-
rent legislation, if Timberlake and
Jackson are sued, they could face up to
$27,500 in fines each — probably far
less than either earned for the perfor-
mance. If CBS is sued, fines could run
into the millions.

Sure, it was in poor taste to reveal
a mammary gland during the tradition-
ally family-oriented halftime show.
But does the FCC really need to swoop
down and spend untold sums investi-
gating “Nipplegate?” It’s probably a
waste of time and effort. _

Maybe this display was a tiny step’
for the United States in the direction
most of the rest of .the world has
already gone, where tasteful nudity on
television is the norm. If so, it could
have been carried out with more class.

Maybe, though, this was just a
monumental publicity stunt. Take that,
former Mrs. Jason Allen Alexander
and Mrs. Guy Ritchie —- er, Britney
Spears and Madonna. »

Fists will pump wildly through the air, and bod-
ies will be moving violently through the crowd.
Sound like a riot? It’s just another stop on a
Dropkick Murphys tour.

Since 1996, Dropkick Murphys have been blow-
ing up punk music with their hard beats, guitars, and
 bagpipes.

Their punk/Irish infusion started in 1996 in
Boston, Mass. Though at first their intention was
only to play music with a few friends for fun, the
result was a sound they identified as a combination
of punk rock, Irish folk, and hardcore. They self-
produced their first few EPs, and eventually began
touring to raise money to support themselves.

After two years, they caught the attention of
Tim Armstrong — the lead singer of Rancid —-— and
his record company Hellcat Records. Armstrong’s

band mate Lars Fredriksen went on to produce

Dropkick Murphys’ major, full—length release, Do or
Die.

Do or Die lit the fuse and Dropkick Murphys’
music spread like wildfire. Establishing worldwide
recognition, they gained fans in Europe, the U.K.,
Ireland, Scandinavia, and Australia. Their, tour itin-
erary quickly changed from small venues in Boston
to Transilvania in Milan, Italy.

Their fourth full—length album Blackout is a contin-
uation of the Dropkick Murphys’ legacy. This album

It’s rather depressing around

THE PITT NEWS

Heinz pays
its “Rent”

Rent

Tues., Feb. 3 through Sun.,
Feb. 8

Heinz Hall

(412) 392-4900

The Broadway smash “Rent”
invades Pittsburgh this week, and
it’s the perfect opportunity to see
one of theatre’s most accessible
shows to date.

“Rent” is not your typical musi-
cal. Yes, it’s based on aniiopera 
Puccini’s “La Boheme”— but
there’s no chance you’ll be falling
asleepduring this rocking produc-
tion. A full band jams on drums and
guitars to various styles of music
throughout the show, playing
everything from rock» and pop to
salsa. A cast of'20-somethings
sings and dances with energy that
will promise to have you tapping

.your foot or humming by the

show’s end.

The story revolves around two
friends, Mark and Roger, who find
themselves’ in their dark, cold
apartment on Christmas Eve. They
have no heat, no power, and a dis-
gruntled landlord demanding the
month’s rent. Mark’s girlfriend
decides to leave him fora perfor-
mance artist named Joanne, while
Roger hasn’t left the apartment in
six months since the’ death of his
own girlfriend. They’re all strug-
gling to survive on the streets of
New York City while dealing_ with
issues like poverty, drugs and
AIDS.

‘Jonathan Larson first created
the Pulitzer Prize-winning show in
1996. Tragically, Larson died one
day before the show opened and
never got-to see its wild success.
After eight years, “Rent” is a living
tribute to Larson, and its universal
themes of love and death promise
to keep it running for years to
come. If you’ve already seen it or if

‘you’ve wanted to, this week is your

chance to grab a friend and check
out “Rent.”

“Rent” is running Downtown at
Heinz Hall from Feb. 3-8. Ticket
prices for Tues., Feb. 3 through
Thurs., Feb. 5 and the evening of
Sun., Feb. 8 are $50.50, $47.50,
$43.50, $35.50. Tickets for the Fri.,

THE BEST PLACE FOR PITT SPORTS NEWS

/

OE

Despite Zefﬁro’s record breaking performance, Pitt lost.

. CHILENA/SPRTS Eonda
Alyse Zefﬁro competes during a competition earlier this season.

MATT GRUBBA
For The Pitt News

Despite a school record-breaking perfor-
man/ce from senior Alyse Zeffiro, the Pitt
gymnastics team was unable to maintain its
undefeated mark in the East Atlantic
Gymnastics League, falling by a score of
195.625—l93.225 to the defending league
champion New Hampshire Wildcats in
Durham, N.H. on Saturday.

Zeffiro scored a 9.875 on the vault, sur-
passing the school record of 9.85, which was
twice tied earlier in the meet, by senior
Erika Goldberg and freshman Andrea
Arlotta. All three scores were career-highs,
as was a 9.8 scored ‘by sophomore April
Pearson, leading the Panthers (4-2-1, 231-1
EAGL) to a school-record 49.075 team score
on the vault. ,

Amanda Hall tied» her own New Hampshire

around competition, winning the meet’s
individual title with a score of 39.45. Pitt did
not have an all-around competitor in the
meet. ‘ .

Each school finished ahead of the other on
two of the apparatuses, with Pitt coming out
on top on the ﬂoor exercise in addition: to the
vault. Zeffiro ‘continued her top—notch per-
formance with a meet-high 9.9 on the ﬂoor,
tying her career-best for the third time in
four meets this season.

(3-2, 2-1 EAGL) school record in the all- ’

Zffo sets ecord in Panthers loss

But the Panthers’ undoing in the team competi-
tion would be the balance beam, where the

J Wildcats were able to gain two full points, coming

out on top in.the event by a score of 48.65-46.65.
Roslyn Singleton’s 9.775 was the best Pitt score,
but was only good enough for fifth-place on the
apparatus. Four New Hampshire gymnasts scored
over 9.8 on the beam.

Equally unkind to the Panthers were the of

uneven bars. Junior co-captain,'Leila Tait followed
up her career-best 9.9 on the previous weekend
with a 9.825, good enough for the best Pitt score,
. but only a fourth-place tie overall.

1 New Hampshire, meanwhile, scored consis-

tently and was mostly error-free throughout the

p meet, posting a 49.05 on the bars, as well as an ‘
even 49 on the vault, which was led by a ‘trio of

9.85 individual scores from Heather Moore,
Vanessa James, and Hall.

The up-and-down scoring of the Panthers made -

it impossible for them to keep “pace with the
Wildcats, and consistency prevailed in the end for
New Hampshire. Neither Pitt head coach Debbie
Yohman nor her assistants could be reached in their
offices for comment on Monday.

Pitt will try to return to the win column in a
quad-meet this Saturday at home. Ivy League
schools Brown and Cornell will travel to Fitzgerald
Field House on Saturday to provide non-league
competition, while Rutgers rounds out the field,
providing EAGL opposition, for the Panthers.

The meet is scheduled to begin at 7 p.m., and
admission is free tolPitt students with their IDs.

Men’s Swimming and Diving

NATE BERGER
For The Pitt News

Adam Vinatieri’s game winning 41-yard field
goal was not the only clutch performance this
weekend. '

Trailing the Virginia Tech Hokies, 104-103,
entering the final race, Eric Bugby, Thomas Bird,
Stephen Kilroy and Darryl Washington set a pool
record with a time of 3:02.62 in the 400-meter
freestyle relay to propel the Panthers to a 123.5-
119.5 win Saturday.

Virginia Tech (6-3), last season’s Big East run-
ner-up, maintained a double-digit lead‘ for most of
the meet until Pitt (10-2), last"season’s' Big East
champion, captured the top three spots in the
men’s 1-meter diving to pullthe Panthers within
one.

After outscoring Pitt 11.5-7.5 in the 200-meter
breaststroke, Virginia Tech, who is moving to the
ACC next year, failed to capture the first-place fin-
ish or the second- and third—place finishes it need-
ed in the final race for its last chance to beat the

5
~.

Panthers in a conference meet.

g ‘‘I think that was a big motivation for them,”
said Panthers’ coach Chuck Knoles. ‘‘It was a very
exciting meet.” .

The same cannot be said for the women’s meet,
as Virginia Tech (7-3) cruised past Pitt (6-6) 146-
96. Pitt’s Andrea Shoust, Kelli Tielking, Ryan
Redman and Kristin Brown gave the Panthers an
early lead with a pool record of 3:49:74 in the 400-
meter medley and it was all downhill from there.

Virginia Tech’s Katy Peterson set a pool record
of 2:01.62 in the 200-meter backstroke. Mason
Walsh set a pool record of 23.15 in the 50—meter
freestyle and joined. Jamie Spradlin, Emily

Guschke, and Meagan Cleary in the 400 freestyle

relay to set a pool record of 3:28.12. _

The Hokies” men splashed their way to ‘pool
records as well. Virginia Tech’s Christian Lindberg
set pool records of 20.01 in the 50 freestyle and
45.11 in the 100-meter freestyle. Gus Calado set
pool records of 1:49.94 in the 200-meter butterﬂy
and 1:40.41 in the 200-meter freestyle.

Calado and Lindberg teamed up with Kevin
Furlong and David Litchfield for a pool record of

defeats Hokies

3:20.14 in the 400 medley. I

The Hokies’ David Szabo won the 200-meter
individual medley, and set a pool record with .a
time of 1:52.74. 1 .

Pitt’s Eric Limkemann won the 500-meter
freestyle with a pool record of 4:33.65.

The Panthers left Blacksburg on a bus for

Charlottesville, where they were dominated by the 5 ~

Virginia Cavaliers on Sunday. .
The Cavaliers won 21 of 26 events en route to
a 128-108 victory for the men (9-1) and a 131-102
win for the women (6-3). ' .
Dennis Nemtsanov provided the bright spots
for the Panthers as he swept the 1- and 3-meter
diving events with scores of 335.25 and 334.95.
" Knoles felt the previous day’s emotional meet

1 and three-hour bus ride contributed to physical

fatigue and scores a little lower than he had hoped
for, but he did not consider the defeat a major dis-
appointment. _

“Right now our ‘focus is on the Big East
Championship,” he said. “Virginia Tech may have
hurt themselves though by resting for our meet.
You can’t rest twice in three weeks.”

Gambles don’t pay off
forFoX and Panthers

 

Two strong defenses are supposed
to make for a low-scoring, boring
affair.‘

But the New England Patriots and
Carolina Panthers showed that the two
squads could hook up in Super Bowl

'XXXVIII and produce possibly one of

the best Super Bowls ever.
For the majority of the first half,
both offenses were dormant, as the

Patriots seemed to lose their momen- ,

tum after eventual hero Adam
Vinatieri missed a 31-yard field goal.

New England’s Tom Brady was
able to engineer two touchdown dri-

A ves with only a few minutes remain-

ing in. the first half. Carolina
answered right back after the»~Patriots’
ﬁrst touchdown with one of its own,
but allowed New England to put a
second touchdown on the board with
under a minute left in the first half.
Even though Carolina answered back
with a field goal, this moment in the
game foreshadowed the future.

_ After watching the Panthers allow
the Patriots to score a touchdown so
quickly, it became obvious when
Carolina tied the score at 29 with 1:08
left on the clock that the Panthers
were doomed.

I am neither a New England fan
nor a Carolina fan, but it would have
been nice to see a different team win
the Super Bowl, as the Patriots have
now won the Super Bowl twice in the
last three years. So I was kind of
pulling for the Panthers.

When Carolina quarterback Jake
Delhomme hit wide receiver Ricky
Proehl around the Patriots’ 20-yard
line with ‘over a minute left’I kept say-
ing, “slow it down and run the ball or
at least go to shorter passes and use
some clock.” But Panthers’ *coach
John Fox went for it all. A couple of
plays later Delhomme and Proehl
hooked up again, this time for a
touchdown that tied the game after the
converted extra point. Fox had
already taken a gamble on the previ-
ous two touchdowns by going for the
two-point conversion instead of the’
conventional point after.

The first time Fox opted to go for

the two-point conversion, there were

' over 12 minutes left in the game. The

score was 21-16 and the two-point
conversion would have made the
score 21-18, which would have put
the game within a field goal. Well

, guess what? Carolina’s defense could-

n’t stop anybody.

Instead, Carolina missed the two-
point conversion attempt and failed to
convert again after its next touch-
down, which put it ahead 22-21.
However, New England scored a
touchdown on the ensuing drive and
was able to earn its two-point conver-
sion. -

These gambles may have put
Fox’s team in a bind, but the biggest

gamble was scoring so quickly. Fox .

has a television and has seen game
film. Brady isdrawing comparisons to
former San Francisco 49ers quarter-
back Joe Montana and former Denver
Broncos quarterback John Elway with
his ability to lead comebacks.

There is no way, ifI were a coach,
that I could have felt comfortable
leaving that much time on the clock.
New England didn’t even burn any of
its timeouts during the Panthers’ last
scoring drive. Instead,Carolina decid-
ed to burn one, which was question-
able. ,

And Panthers kicker John Kasay’s
kickoff out of bounds really put his
team in a bind, but you can’t blame
the_loss on Kasay. Carolin‘a’s defense
still had ample opportunity to stop the
Patriots, but failed to do so. i

It was very puzzling that the best
defensive line in football could not
register one sack on Brady. So, he was
able to hit several big plays down
field all game. On offense, the
Panthers’ running game. stalled and
Fox was probably guilty of sticking
with it too long-, but when.he needed
to go back to it for a play or two just

to eat up theclock he didn’t, and

that’s what cost him.

It was deja vu all over again from
New England’s first Super Bowl win
over the St. Louis Rams. Proehl
caught a touchdown pass to tie the
game, which was followed by_ Brady

driving his team down field with only‘

a few seconds left on the clock.
Vinatieri marched out on the field and
nailed the game winning kick.
Hopefully, teams are watching
and will learn from this formula; You
don’t want to give Brady any amount
of time to mount a comeback. Brady
is young, but it appears that when it is
all saidand done.he will be a great
