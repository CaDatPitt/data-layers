Body Exhumed

Dallas pathologists confirmed
yesterday that the‘ body buried in
Lee Harvey Oswald’s grave was
definitely that of Oswald. the
man accused of assassinating

I963. .

The findings. determinedin an
autopsy following a before—dawn
 exhumation ofthe body at a Fort
VI Worth. Tex.. cemetery. disprove
the theory that Kennedy was
murdered by a Russian sharp-
shooter who assumed Oswald’s
identity after Oswald defected to
the Soviet Union in I959.

The theory had been advanced
by British author Michael
Eddowes. who spent between
$l0.000 and $l2.000 for the
exhumation.

About I00 people watched the.
body reburied in a metal casket
at Fort Worth’s Rose HilliBurial.
Park shortly before dusk.

Ciwrriculum Debate Continues.

Appeal Committee Recommended

By MARY KANE

Formation ofa faculty committee.

to rule on student appeals ofthe pro-
posed curriculum requirements was
recommended by the Faculty ofArts
and Sciences and College of Arts
and Sciences councils at a joint
meeting Friday. i

Physics and astronomy professor
Edward Gerjuoy. who proposed the
amendment. said ‘the committee
would modify the standard curricu-
lum “for any student whose individ-
ual circumstances warrant such
mo_dification."

“We are proposing a fairly elabo-
rate scheme for a wide variety of
students.” Gerjuoy said. “It isonly

“appropriate that students have the
rightrto recommend substantiated
changes in their curriculum.’’,

Gerjuoy said an example ofsuch a
student would be one who had lived
in India before coming to Pittibut
would still have to take a course in a

_ non-Western culture to fulfill his

requirements.
History teaching fellow Allan
Galpern didn't believe the require-

_~\ments were too burdensome.

“Of L000 illustrations you could
have chosen. if the worst is a person
who has to take three credits in a
non-western culture. then it doesn’t
seem too onerous to me.” Galpern
said. 0 R ‘

Gerjuoy. however. said students
should have the right to modify their
curricula if they find taking a differ-

‘ ent course more worthwhile.

CAS Dean lrwin Schulman ques-
tioned what he called the “vague-
ness” of the proposal. saying he
feared it would give students a “way
out" oftaking-the proposed require-
ments. He added that “since a sub-
stantial part of my job is dealing
with students who are having trou-
yble meeting their requirements." it
might be more appropriate for his
office to handle any appeals.

Tom Cohen, a student representa-

tive to the CAS Council, said that
“students should have the right to
appeal to another body.” _

The amendment to form the com-
mittee passed l4—4. although the last
sentence of the amendment was
deleted. The last sentence had read:
“The committee on appeals is
requested to interpret the aforemen-
tioned objectives liberally. to
encourage student initiative in
attaining desirable educational
goals." Some facultyimembers had
said that the sentence was redundant

and thus unnecessary.

In another issue that dealt with
the implementation ofthe proposed
requirements. Schulman proposed
an amendment that would require
the faculty committees formed to
implement the requirements to also
evaluate the ‘new courses annually.

be submitted to student evaluation

Percent Increase in StateAid for 1982

By SETH LUBOVE

Despite having made a “pretty
persuasive ease“ for receiving a l4.5
percent increase in state support for
fiscal year i983. Pitvtgwill probably
receive approximately o percent
more than it received in fiscal year
l982. according to state Secretary of
Education Robert Scanlon.

“I think the reality ofthe situation
is more in the op_ercent rangethan in
the l4.5 percent, range,” he said‘. “lg
don‘t think the realities ofthe ‘eco-O '

nomic situation will allow it."

Scanlon cited Gov. Richard
Thornburgh‘s directive to all state
agencies that increases in budget
requests be held at o percent.

Scanlon was more optimistic.
‘however. on the possibility of medi-
cal education funding throughout
the state.

“I think we may have some chance
fora breakthrough in medical edu-
cation funding." he said.

M But he described Pitt's recommen-
dation that medical capitation per

i

student be increased to $l5.2l2 per
student from the current level of
$7.405 as “not realistic."

“We’re not in an economic envir-
onment where tha!‘s receptive." he
said. ‘

try Pitt is asking the state for $85.5

million in appropriations for fiscal.»
year I983. an increase of$l0.8 mil-
lion over this year’s appropriation.
The request breaks down into
increases of: $6 million for educa-
tion and general expenses; $4 mil-

By SETH LUBOVE

Pitt has decided to ease up on its
attempt to recoup losses from one of
the convicted defendants in a I979
investment fraud.

- “We are not pursuing the broker
from Memphis, Tenn. =(Larry T.
Lee) very strongly anymore because
court proceedings have determined
"that he is essentially assetless, and
we could spend more money in legal
fees trying to get blood out of a
stone,” said Joseph Duttonl. vice

chancellor for business and finance. .

' . He added that the university has
not entirely dropped legal proceed-
ings against Lee, “but we are not

throwing legal dollars in trying to "

pursue it because we believe there’s
little there, if anything."

Lee, a former Memphis securities
salesman who received a three-year
suspended sentence and two year’s
probation for his part in the fraud,
was one of three defendants in a trial
which took place this..luly in Hous-
ton, Texas.

N Other defendants were former
All-Pro football player Bill Howton,
50,‘ the president of the now-
bankrupt First Financial Group of
_Texas, and the company's vice presi-
dent, Vining Tower Reynolds Jr.,
40.

The two were found guilty July 24
on 24 fraud-related counts, and were

later sentenced by Judge Robert

O’Conor to five years in prison for
each count. Each man will serve his
sentences concurrently, and thus
will spend a total of ﬁve years in
prison.

Pitt was one of five institutions
that lost a total of $8 million to First
Financial Group. ‘Pitt lost $1.5 mil-
lion in Aug., I979, when it invested
in an attractive short-term package
backed by government-guaranteed
student loans that never actually
existed.

First Financial guaranteed to buy
back the loans in 60 to 90 days with

\ an ll percent interest. Instead, the

money was allegedly funneled into
secret accounts in the Cayman
Islands and Switzerland.

A possible fourth participant in
the scam, prosecutors contend, was
a precious—metals salesman from
India, Arbad “Bob" Kahn, 29 He
controlled the bank account into
which First Financial funds were

, transferred.

Ka‘hn’s bodv was found April I,
l980——one week before he was
scheduled to testify before the grand
jury—-with a .32 caliber bulletin his
chest. Howton and his two partners
are suspects in Kahn’s death.

The money Pitt invested came out
of a cash reserve derived from the
physical plant fund, Dutton said.

In I979, when the university
should have shown a total of $2 mil:

lion in interest derived from the
physical plant fund, only $500,000 in
income is present due to the SL5
million loss.

Now, the university is using three
local banks as brokers for any secu-
rities investments, Dutton said. The
money is sent to one of three custo-

dian banks—Mellon, Pittsburgh
National and Equibank~-who attest

that the investment isn’t a fraud. The
university is charged a fee by the
bank for this service, but the bank is
insured in the case of fraud.

Two savings and loans associa-
tions in the area were also losers in
the fraud:WheeIing DollaT Bank of
Wheeling, W. Va., which lost $1.75
million, and Potters Savings & Loan
of East Liverpool, Ohio. which lost

SGB Election Process Begins

By CHRIS CLINTON

The student government elections
process was kicked off at the Stu-
dent Government Board meeting
last Thursday. V

In other action, the board
declined to take "a stand on the pro-

.posed CAS curriculum reform

changes until a further study can be
conducted by the board members.

Board member Colleen Clarke
presented the new elections code,
by-laws and time schedule to the
board for their scrutiny.

Clarke said the’ elections code
remains almost the same as previous
years except for some minor
changes.

Two of the changes are: the elec-
tions will be held on two days
instead of three and candidates will
be allowed to spend $65 dollars of
their own money on campaigning
instead of the usual $60.

‘ The Board will study the code and,
vote on it at their next ineeting. If the
elections process changes are
approved, petitioning for board
positions‘ will begin on Oct. I2 and

the elections will be held on Nov. I8 '

and I9,.
In other business, Tom Cohen,

CAS Council member, presented to
__ the boardua list of i-iecnlutions con-

I.

 
 

join

inLa”w?

cerning the proposed curriculum
reform changes.

Most of the discussion of the
changes focused on the foreign lan-
guage requirements proposed by the
CAS Curriculum Reform Commit-
tee. Cohen suggested that ‘the board
recommend “a further study of the
language requirement.”

He said area high schools are not
prepared for this requirement since
many do not require two years study
of another language.

“The university has no right to
enforce these (requirements) on area
high schools,“ Cohen said. A

Board member Mark Stevens
defended the foreign language
requirement and said the board
should recommend it be kept in the
proposal.

“Foreign language (study) is_

important,” he said. “The university
is trying to make students well-
rounded byreqluiring this."

Cohen and_ Stevens could agree

. neither on the definition of, nor on-

the need for-a second language in
being “well-rounded." °

SGB president Bill Abraham sug-
gested that the board and other
interested students review the
changespoint by point before mak-
ing any type of statement of support
or opposition.

In other action. the board:

0 Approved an emergency request
from the Black Action -Society of
$864 for programs associated with
Black Week. _

0 Approved \‘ two emergency
requests for the Engineering Student
Cabinet»-one for a lecture by
Robert Malone, assistant editor of
Omni magazine and the other for an
ice skating party at Schenley Park.

0 Rejected . two emergency
requests by the Resident Student
Association for expenses for two

conferences until further informa-
tion is given by the RSA.‘

0 Approved a emergency request
by the Pitt Hockey Club_to add more
practices and games. at the Civic
Arena. P C

0 Approved an emergency request
by the Pitt Chess Club to travel to
the Pan-‘Am games. _-

_ Finally, the board heard a request

from Guy Molinari, an editor of

the ‘Pittsburgh Undergraduate
Review (a serriiannual publication of
undergraduate worké‘, for $94l.l0.
The funds will be sed to solicit
alumni contributions and to hire a
work-study student. ' »

Abraham told Molinari that since
the program is not a recognized stu-
dent organization, the board can not
help finance it. But he recommended

-that Molinari take his case before

the Media and Publications Board.

By MARY KANE

The Oakland section of Forbes
Avenue resembles a race track. with
cars. trucks and buses screaming By as
they v switch lanes. Scattered among
them are students. artfully dodging the
vehicles and having only one goal in
mind to get across the street-—-the 7-ll
c_<()invenience store on the other side.
si e.

As conspicuous as the 7-1 I store is—-
its huge neon sign is more than
distrac'tii'i'g* manager Bob Uccellino
said he still stocks the store with a spe-
cial constituency in mind. the students.

“lfl had my way. I’d make the store
a lot bigger and get rid of all the sub-
stantial stuff," Uccellino said.

That’s because it‘s the pop. candy
and juices that draw the students in,
not the meats, cheeses andbread the
store also sells, Uccellino said. And
even though it isn't even time for mid-
terms, the store “is going through an
awful lot of coffee.” he added.

So much for nutrition.

Regardless, Uccellino can’t really
always have his way with the store
because of special provisions in the
lease that 7-ll signed with, Pitt.

If you've been wondering why you
can’t get microwave foods. fountain
drinks or “slurpees.” blame it on Pitt,
not Uccellino. The manager said
because Pitt is worried about a litter
problem, it prohibited 7-1] from sel-
ling those things. ln fact. the coffee
everyone keeps goingin for was intro-
duced on a six-month trial basis,-'basi-
cally forthe same reason. Uccellino
thinks the coffee and tea passed the

test. however. because they are still
being served and the six months are up.

Students may be a blessing for the
store in the monetary sense; however.
they do cause some problems in other
ways. such as stealing.

“There's an awful lot ofshoplifting."
Uccellino said. “lt's a bigger problem
than I’d like it to be.” t .

And please don’t ask for change for

your five-spot. Uccellino emphasized“‘<'*

that the store can’t give any change
because its supply often runs out. ,1

Uccellino has a lot of things on his
mind besides nickels and dimes. As
manager, he has to worry about order-
ing supplies and merchandising. as well
as doing paperwork and keeping the
store stocked with people as -well as
food. " .

Uccellino came to Oakland 7-]! in
March. after managing a 7-l I in Law-
renceville. That was a “neighborhood
store," he said. not quite as busy as the
Oakland location. “And we're unique
because we don’t have any pet or baby
supplies,” Uccellino said.

But then again. not too many stu-
dents worry about feeding the dog and

the baby when they get back to their"

Towers room. Some of them frequent

7—ll so often. however. that they

become regulars just, like the kind
you’d see at your neighborhood store,
Uccellino said.

He and his “right arm.” assistant
manager Nancy Goldberg. don‘t seem
to mind. . . /-

“I wouldnt trade my kids for any-

...»h’

thing.” Goldberg said. “They’re a

bunch of nice kids.”

On Oct. 3 at the Carnegie

“Dungeons and Dragons" nov-
ices of all ages got together with

six enthusiasts (Randy Stone. ~

Richard Kramer, David George.
Jamie Carwile. Danny Treger.
and Eugene White) to acquaint
themselves with the rules and
philosophy of the fantasy-
inspired game better known as
D&D. »

loosely following a plot set up by
a _Dungeon Master. He controls
the environment.perhaps adding
assassins or buried treasure at
any turn. The object ofthe game
for the players is to stay alive,
although a cleric can perform a
miracle and raise the dead.

“The Dungeon Master is more‘
or less the referee ofthergame: he —

creates a fantasy curriculum that
exists only in his mind, then he
takes the people through it by

describing it to them." explained

Richard Kramﬁer.

David’George outlined the six

basic attributes ofany character:
0 Strength. physical strength,
handy for fighters.

0 l~ntelligence—— — reasoning

power, a prime requisite for
magic-users. .
0 Wisdom — judgment and
common sense, vital for clerics.
0 Dexterity speed and accu-
racy. necessary to good thieves.
.5 Constitution» fitness,
health and resistance. character-

istic of dwarves and halﬂings.

0 Charisma ~ personal mag-
netism and wit. which trolls don't
care much about, but which
innkeepers do.

To begin the game.la player
rolls the dice to determinehow
much of each characteristic he

has. For example. he might roll

high
and dexterity but low inthe other
attributes. On the basis ofthis. he

v,,migh_t decide to be a dwarf.

“While characters wander

. around in your world. they get

into lots of fights. Thats the
game. Fighting is a good form of
relaxation," George said. He
added that. although the fighting
is fun. the main focus ofthe game

- is the plot.

“Even the best-ru-n campaign
means nothing if there‘s no
meaning behind it." Stone said.
“because it can eventually get
boring with hack. slash. take the
money and run.”

A plot can be made up by the
Dungeon Master or he can base
it upon a, hovel; There are
varoius manuals (about $15) that
give explicit guidelines. You will
determine your character‘s
attributes and to decide such
things as whether you have
enough “hit points“ to kill
another character.

which currentiy handles course eval-

tor only. would be able to handle the
extra work involved in the evalua-
tion -of more courses.

Other faculty members. however.
said charging the committees with

the evaluations would overburden,

them.

"Whether or not you employ the
Center for the Evaluation ofTeach—
ing is not thequestion." (ialpern

said. ‘‘It’s whether you will overt{D<_

Michael Margolis. a political

“lt‘s better to judge a course b_v
looking at several terms." Margolis
said; i ' t

The councils eventually voted I4-
8 to subject the courses to biannual.
rather than annual. review. The
council’s vote also specified that the
courses be submitted for student
evaluation. such as those done by
the Center for the Evaluation of
Teaching.

Schulman also proposed an
amendment that would make his
appointments to the committees
charged with implementationofthe
requirements subject to consultation
with the departments and approval
of the FAS Council. This amend-
ment was approved by voice vote.

The original proposal had stated
that the dean would appoint faculty/
members to committees that would
be responsible for approving new
courses and overseein i

    

their

implementation.

Sehulman said he introduced the
amendment because some faculty
“were fearful of the possibilities“
given toone person for the appoint-
ments. He added. however. that he
believed it was “essential that some-

  Endorsem ntsl

The implementation and evaluation of the
proposed curriculum requirements is as
important as their substance. Establishing
the mechanics for doing this, however, is a
matter that is causing discussion and dis-
agreement among members of the Faculty of
Arts and Sciences and College of Arts and
Sciences councils, whose members are ana-
lyzing the proposed requirements before they
come up for a vote of the full faculty Oct. l0.

The problem seems to occur notiin theidea
of an evaluation—a1most all the members
agree that some kind of evaluation is
essential—but in the way the evaluation
should be handled. V 4

L It had been originally proposed that eval-
uations of any new courses developed in
response to the proposed requirements be
handled by the Center for the Evaluation of
Teaching (CET), which now conducts course

« evaluations, but only when‘ instructors
request‘ them.

There «are two important things about the

i .CET evaluations. First, they allow students

to evaluate the courses, because. their results
are based” na questionnaire that is given to
students concerning the course. Second, CET
course evaluations have been used to evalu-
ate honors program courses for some time
now, and they have resulted in theea-ncella-
tionof unfit courses and the continuation of
effective ones.  C _ --

The FAS and CAS councils voted at Fri‘-
day’s meeting to change the wording of an
amendment that would require new courses
to be evaluated under the auspices of the CET
to one that would subject the courses to eval-
uation such as those conducted by-the CET.
Why the change’ was made is unclear. One
member suggested that the extra work would
overburderi the CET; another wondered,
quite seriously‘,‘whether students should"be
included in the evaluation at all.

The re-wording-~~o—f...thee original amend-
ments and its eventual acceptance by the -
councils amounts to an attempt to sidestep a
difficult issue. Their endorsement of such an

_=~...,,,~igntentionally vague amendment leaves open

£6 questioning how courses will be evaluated
and whatsay students will have in the evalua-

tion. The amendment revision is a disap- --
-pointment, especially since it, comes from a

body that proelaimsitself to be solidly behind
the ideals. of a quality education and the
achievement of desirable educational goals.
It is hoped that, on Oct. 10, the ‘full faculty
will approve or reject proposals that are q
straightforward in their intentions.

The death of Stonewall Morgan
Stickney last Thursday night in a
Cathedral of Learning courtyard
sparked. an ironic series of events
that displayed the contrast between
what one is taught to do and what

' actually occurs. . _
The first woFd of something dra-

went out over the police radio men-
tioning the possible homicide or sui-
cide of an individual at the

' Cathedral. Within minutes.'several
Pitt News reporters and the campus
police arrived on the sc'ene. Shortly
afterward. at about 7:45. the televi-
sion crews arrived.‘

.ln a few hourspthe whole thing
was over. The-body was gone. the
crowds had dispersed. and the lights
and cameras had been packed away.
By I ll, p.m.. :Stickney’s death was a
prominent feature in all three of
Pittsburgh‘s network TV affiliates.

Each treatment was different and
was used to a different end.

Panthers Swarm
- » South Caroina

By JOHN ETTE HOWARD

COLUMBIA. S.C. -— Soon after
halftime and long after ABC-TV's
Keith Jackson and his golden throat
were given the rest ofthe day off, the
fourth-ranked Pitt Panthers found
themselves in a football game again.

“ And found some maturity in the

process.

For the first 35 minutes of Satur-
day’s 42-28 thumping of the South
Carolina (2-3) Gamecocks. un-
beaten Pitt, led by a tenacious defen-
sive line and a record—setting
six-touchdown performance by
quarterback Dan Marino, subdued
the Gamecocks and the 56,495 fans
in Carolina’s Williams-Brice
Stadium.

But too much. too easily. too soon
can subdue a defensive team, too.
Ask Pitt,_whose defense, except for

’ one shaky stretch in the third quar-

ter, cut through the Carolina offen-
sive line for ll sacks.

A “We got up early and we just
relaxed," admitted Pitt defensive
end Michael Woods, who at one

point in the second half recorded

three consecutive sacks of Carolina’s
beleaguered quarterback Gordon
Beckham. “After the penalty, we got
upset, and everyone let up a little
instead ofpicking it up."

The penalty Woods referred to
was a third-quarter personal foul
call on Pitt’s Phil Puzzuoli that gave
Carolina new life with Pitt leading

42-7. Puzzuoli showed Saturday
what a versatile athlete he is: he runs,
he tackles and he packs a mean right
hook, a fact that hit home often at
the expense of Carolina __offensive \
guard Cas Danielowski.

The officials. none too impressed
with Puzzuoli or his pugilistic skill,
introduced him to a Pinkerton
security guard, who efficiently
escorted Pluzzuoli to the dressing
room for the rest of the game.

Carolina. meanwhile, went on to
score the second of its four second-
half touchdowns, greatly aided on
fourth down by two costly Pitt
penalties»-~ roughing the passer and ~
interference in the end zone.

After the interference call. Caro '-
na’s Todd Berry tumbled in from l
yard out. The Gamecocks began to
fight back; Pitt Coach Jackie Sher-
rill’s team: after l l quarters offoot-
ball. was ﬁnally challenged.

“The penalties hurt us,” ‘Sherrill
said in reference to the Gamecocks‘
late scoring surge after being held to
just one first down in the opening
half. “It wasn't so much the adver-
sity as our lack of maturity (that
started Carolina's rebound). We
lacked it somewhat in the third quar-
ter. We lost our consistency. That
second half seemed four hours long
to me.” > V

In the first two quarters, Pitt
lacked very little. After a muffed
snap and a missed 25-yard field goal

Doleman Sackscarolina

By JOHNETTEW HOWARD

COLUMBIA, S.C. --— In the
shadows of Hugh Green, Ricky
Jackson and the ghost of drop
ends past. Pitt freshman defen-
sive end Chris Doleman started
his second consecutive game Sat-
urday. against the South Caro-
vlina Camecocks. with one nag-
ging anxiety.

“This week, I had my work cut
out for me. And...ldidn’t wantto
go on nationalTV and looklikea
fool.” Doleman said, laughing.

By the end ofSaturday’s game,
it was. the Gamecocks who
walked off red-faced, their quar-
terback Gordon Beckliam shell-
shocked, their offensive line
“outplayed and whipped."
according to Carolina Coach
Jim Carlen. And it was because

_ ofthe 6-6. 220-pound Doleman’s

performance...just_his third col-
legiate football game.

In the tradition ‘~ that has
rapidly become associated with

 

The scoreboardt Caolina adium sat it all.

 

his Pitt position. Doleman play-
ing from Hugh Green’s drop end
slot. shot through the Carolina
line for eight tackles Saturday.

. five of them for losses, including

five sacks of Beckham.

» When he wasn’t belting Beck-
ham to the turf, Doleman did the
next best thing---reaching out his
long. wiry arms to reject two
attempted passes. One tipped
ball fell into the arms of Panther
Rich Krayinak on the Carolina
l2-yard line, setting. up Pitt’s
second touchdown of the game.
All in a day's work, for Doleman.
who says he doesn‘t feel required
to approximate his predecessors
performances on defense.

“You just have to go out and
play yourigame; you can’t go in
figuring to play to fill anyone
else’s shoes, Doleman said. “Oth-
erwise. you won’t be the best
ballplayer you can be. l’_m just
looking to improve week to
week.” C

When he first arrived at Pitt,

\

 

despite getting the" coaches’
praise soon after camp started.
Doleman wasn’t confident he’d
see much playing time this sea-
son. Five upperclassmen, includ-
ing first-game starter Al
Wenglikowski. and two other
freshmen were in competition
with Doleman for the starting
end spot. ,

“I got a little discouraged at
camp and thought about switch-
ing back to tight end,” said Dole-
man. who had played both
offense and defense in high
school in York. Pa. “But Coach
Sherrill kept encouraging me
and told me it was coming along.
That helped."

By the first week ofthe season.
Doleman had played his way up
to the second team on the
Panther depth chart, and when
Wenglikowski went down with
an ankle sprain in the first game,

the coaches sent in Doleman.

2—4—l. No. it is not the daily‘

number. and if it were. the Pitt‘Lady
Panther field hockeyiteam certainly
wouldn”t play it. Luck has not been
on their side lately.

Despite their domination of two
out of three away games played
Thursday and Friday. the Lady
Panthers could not chalk one up in
the win column. Losses to Bucknell
and Bloomsburg State. and a tie
with Wilkes—Barre dropped Pitt‘s
season record to 2-4-1. 7

The Bucknell game. played on
Thursday afternoon. was a reunion
of sorts. Former Pitt coach Martha
Ludwig. who led the team to its best
year ever last season. is now coach-
ing the Bucknell squad.

Bucknell moved out to a 2-0 half-
time lead. and the Lady Panthers
never quite got back into the contest.
In the second half. Bucknell scored
twice to secure a 4-1 victory. Pitt‘s
lone goal came in the second half on
a slap shot by Margie Hall.assisted
by a pass from Terry Zygarowicz.

Despite the loss. Pitt’s.c"oach was
impressed by the team‘s play.

“Bucknell scored on several
breakaway plays." said Coach
Cindy 'DiGiacomo. “We weren’t

'I7n"“PiII N('u‘.s', Mmulay. ()¢'mIwr 5: I981 ’

really outplayed. Actually. I think
we were the stronger team. Theyjust
got lucky on the breakaways.“

ln their contest against Blooms-
burg State on. Friday. the Lady
Panthers controlled the entire game.
but again came out on the short end
of a 2-0 score. »»

The struggling .Lady Panther
front line could not put the ball in
the net fora score. yet had more
shots on goal than Bloomsburg
State. Bloomsburg scored both its
goals in the second half. The first
came on a penalty shot halfway
throughthe second half. and the
second came with about three min~
utes remaining in the game.

Later that afternoon Pitt battled
with Wilkes—Barre. The La_dV Pan-
thers didn‘t lose this one. but they
didn‘t win either. Once again. Pitt
had more shots on goal than the
opposition. but was unable to capi-
talize on them. Wilkes—Barre held
the lead at halftime I-0.

Five minutes into the second half.;.

senior Kim Jeffreys. who had.never
played field hockey until this year.
flipped in a shot for Pitt's only goal.
The Lady Panthers’ continued to
dominate play until the game’s end.
but theycould not pull out the win.

Coach DiGiacomo could provide

iLady‘F5anthers Drop Two

little explanation for the team’s
offensive difficulties.

“We have really played well."said
DiGiacomo. “l’m very puzzled why
the ball isn't going in the goal. lt’s
frustrating for me and the players."

According to DiGiacomo. there
are several things to remain optimis-
tic about. ‘despite the tough road
trip. Dee Dee Kantner and Sue Sha-
heen continue to play well and give
the Lady Panthers strong leader-
ship. Jessica Black.who sat out two
games with a bone fracture. had her

‘cast removed on Tuesday. Black was

used sparingly in the Bucknell con-
test. but played the duration of both
the Bloomsburg State and Wilkes-
Barre games.

Pitt‘s defense performed consist-
ently well in all three games. accord-
ing to the teams coach. “I think the
most impressive thing this weekend

was our defense.’‘ said ’DiGiacomo.
“I think we showed the East we can

play well. The defense is young, but
they’re doing great. Stella Volpe.
Debbie Madera. and Terry Zygaro—
wic7. are playing well right now.”

The Lady Panthers will have the
week off as they prepare to host the
first Pitt field hockey tournament
October 9 and I0.

Pitt’s Dee Dee Kantner has continued to soar despite her teamtsrecenttough losses
and lack of offense, according to Coacihycindy D_iGaccamo.

Pitt‘s Bill Maas also played well.

“We did a greatjob in the first half

all around offensively. defensively
and kicking,"Sherrill said. “The def-
ensive line played an excellent foot-
ball game. and Danny (Marino) and
the receivers did a great job."
i Pitt scored ifs final two touch-
‘downs ofthe game in the third quar-
ter". again through the air. Carolina
punter Chris Norman faked a punt
on fourth and 17. ran left and went

first down sticks. Pitt and Marino
went to work again on the Carolina

kins between two defenders for a 30-

On the Panthers’ next series.
Brown closed out the Pitt scoring
with an 8-yard TD reception. The
pass was Marino’s sixth TD toss of
the day. which broke Matt Cava-
naugh’s Pitt single-game mark of
five. j

Marino’s 346 yards passing was
also the second highest single-game
total in Pitt history.

Marino slightly sprained his right

away impressed with the Panthers.

“I think Pittsburgh has a finefoot-

the first half. Their defense didn't

they're just  small step behind."
Carlen said. A

Despite Pitt’s third—quarter lapse.
Sherrill came away pleased with his
team’s performance underthe pres-

the Gamecock scoring blitz in the
second half.

“I didn‘t know about our No. 4

By STEVE GUIDAS

Saturday was a day that quarter-
back Art Schlichter may long‘
remember. but it was a day that his
team. the Ohio State Buckeyes.
would soon ‘like to forget. Oklaho-
ma’s Skooners and Mississippi State‘s
Bulldogs probably don’t want to
recall what happened on Saturday.

ball teams were toppled in weekend
gridiron action.

Ohio State.~ranked No. 7. was
upset by Florida State 36-27. Des-
pite the loss. Buckeye signal-caller
Schlichter had a strong outing with a‘
record-setting 458 yards passing.

His performance broke the previous ,

Ohio State single—game. passing
record of 312 yards set by John Bor-
ton in 1952. ’
Schlichter completed 31
passes en route to his record.

last-minute loss one week ago to

State 7-7. The Sooner,s’ record now

. stands at 1-1-1.

Oklahoma took the lead in the
first quarter on a 16-yard run by
freshman Steve Sew'ell, then failed
to score for the remainder of the
contest. Iowa States only touch-
down came in the fourth quarter on
a 3-yard run by Dwayne

’Crutchfield.

lMissouri upset No. 9 Mississippi
State 14-3 in a regionally-turned-
nationally televised game. Missouri
managed to score in the first and last
quarters. The-game featured two
tough defensive teams. Missouri‘is
now 4-0 this season. .

This game. slated originally for
ABC's Midwest regional telecast.
was ultimately seen by most of the
nation after the network switched its
viewers in the East from the Pitt-
South Carolina matchup soon after

. Pitt took a 21-0 lead in the first

quarter.

The No. 1 USCiTrojans continued
their winning ways, trouncing
Oregon State‘s Beavers 56-22. Tro-
jan tailback Marcus Allen did some
trouncing ofhis own -- bteakingtwo‘
rushing records and scoring three

touchdowns.’

Allen now holds. the NCAA“

record for consecutive 2()0-yard
rushing’ games with four and the
record for total yards rushing in four
games with 925.

Two more collegiate records may
be within Allen’s reach. He could
break the record for most 200-yard
games rushing in a season (five); set
in 1971 by Cornell’s Ed Marinaro.

It's also conceivable that he could
break the I single-season rushing
record of 1,948 yards, set by Pitt’s

_ Tony Dorsett in 1976.

Second-ranked Penn State shut
out the Temple Owls 30-0 before a
sellout crowd at Beaver Stadium in
University Park. This marks the
second shutout and the second.sel1-

season for Penn State.

After a slow start. the Nittany
Lions got on track. By game‘s end.
running back Curt Warner rushed

continued from page ten
nati, Doleman got his tirst colle-
giate start.
Perhaps it's no wonder Dole-
_ man claims that the biggest dif-
ference in going from high school
to collegiate football is the whirl-
wind pace.
“The intensity ofthe game is so
much higher and requires so
much concentration in college,"
‘ Doleman said. “You don’t know
what the other team will be
doing You have to be ready in a
split second for anything they
throw at you.” -

Which is why, despite his
exceptional performance Satur-
day, Doleman-stresses he still
needs to work on the basics——
picking up offenses, working on
technique and increasing his
strength.

Although he finds college
football “more demanding,"

Doleman said-the move up in

flights of competition does have
its advantages.

“its a real change from riding
old buses, the flying to games.
lt’s fun. First you're here, then
you’re “there,” Doleman said,
laughing.

Which is what the Carolina
offensive linemen were probably
mumbling about Doleman all
‘afternoon. Though he said he
was “pretty happy” with his
game, which he called “pretty
good,” Doleman thought- the
Panthers handled themselves,
well...pretty badly in the third

quarter when Carolina, aided by

several Pitt miscues, erupted for
21 of its 28 points.

“We were ahead and we
relaxed, which is one thing you
can't do,” Doleman said “It's. the
trait of ayoung team. We knew

. the game wasn’t over, but wejust

relaxed physically.” _

ginia this Saturday, in Morgan-
town, ‘Doleman said he thinks
the Panthers’ can affordtno such
relapse. He said he‘s already
experienced the din a WVU
crowd can generate.

“I went to a basketball game
down there. They had l5,000
people, and those fans are wild.
We have to control that. We got
to get on them (WVU.) before
they get started," Doleman
offered.

“You can’t letthem "(the fans)
get too cocky,” he continued
“Against South Carolina, it got

_pretty loud there down on the
field, and the team thought they j

were going to do something. You

I can’t let them get started.”

Doleman should know. Once
he got rolling Saturday, he never
stopped coming. Just ask
Carolina. t

By PAMELA oxmo

Over the past four years,
senior Al Adelmann has seen
changes in the Pitt soccer team,
both in the players and in the
team as a whole.

As a freshman, Adelmann
looked to ex-Pitt players such as
Johnny O’Hara and Louie Nye
for guidance. O’Hara, now with-
the Pittsburgh Spirit, served as a
role model for Adelmann. To
this day, Adelmann credits
O‘Hara as being the one colle-
giate player he most admires.

“Johnny 0. was the one per-
son I really looked up. to as a
young player on the Pitt team.
He really had a lot ofskill. I don’t
think any freshman player looks
up to me like I did to Johnny,"
said Adelmann, one ofthis year's
team captains. “The skill these
players have right out of high
school is a lot better than mine
was. lfthey do look up to me, it’s
because l have more game expe-
rience than they do, not more
skill.“ ’

While Adelmann saw a big
change in his own skill during his
freshman year, he feels that the
next two years of playing were
not personally satisfying. “I
didn‘t grow as much as I should
have. There just wasn‘t anyone
like Johnny to learn from,”
explained Adelmann,

Today’s Pitt soccer team
differs vastly from ‘the team
Adelmann played gn during his
first year with Pitt.

“We played a different style of
ball. Although the style of coach-
ing has remained the same, the

“teams are deﬁnitely different

teams,” said Adelmann. “My
freshman year, the team had
more guided movement. That
team had excellent skill. They
played a slow, build-up kind of
game. Now, we have a team with
a very spirited attitude, a lot of
hustle and a real ’kill’ instinct."

deflmann a Leader,

Al Adelmann

Adelmann, who decribes him-
self as a player with “slow build- «
up" during the game, explains
the difference in h_is:.personality
on and off the field.

“There's quite a difference,”
smiled Adelmann. “Offthe field),
I’m a very reserved person and I
seldom lose my temper. ‘On the
field, it‘s a different story. l have
a big mouth out there, and I like
to control the game. We been
known to lose my temper during
the game, but I concentrate very
hard when I‘m playing.” ‘

Adelmann also gets involved
in the game when he’s not play-
ing. lt's not uncommon to see
him striding back and forth on
the sidelines, shouting i-nstruc-
tions and directing his team-
mates on the field. He never loses
his intensity. 6

As a midfielder, Adelmann’s
excellence in leadership, skill,
consistency and persistence has
helped the 1981 Pitt soccer team »
to come this far with a 6-1 season
record. Johnny 0., you‘ve influ-

' enced a real winner.

Belkin, Jacobson sixth
Among East’s Elite

c'(mIinuedfi'un1_ page eleven
Belkin and Jacobson dropped the
first set, 7-5, before rebounding to
[wrench away the match win with

0 consecutive 6-4 set victories.

The win was the highlight of the
Pitt duo‘s’ fine performance
throughout the three-day tourna-
ment. And the sixth-place overall
finish was “probably one of the fin-
est accomplishments of anybody
ever-~men or womenwin Pitt ten-
nis,” according to Pitt Coach
George Dieffenbach.

“A sixth place in the East is proba-
bly the best we‘ve (Pitt) ever done.
The girls were unseeded and upset
quite a lot of teams that were real.
real strong," Dieffenbach said. “The
more they play, the better they get. It
was a great win.“

Belkin and Jacobson opened the
competition with a 6-2, 6-0 win over
Seton Hall’s Kim Savage and Sue
Kennedy. After disposing of Wil-
liam and Mary’s Dudley and Milli-
gan, the Pitt pair thumped
Lafayette’s Judy Einhorn and Jill
Rae 6-l , 6-0. 6

“Randi and Cathy were really up
after their first two wins, and they
gained a lot of confidence.” Dief-
fenbach said.

After the three wins Friday, Bel-
kin and Jacobson stumbled in the
quarterfinal round Saturday morn-
ing, falling to Penn State’s Carol
Daniels and Susan Whiteside in
straight sets , 6-2. 6-2. Daniels and
Whitcsidc went on to finish second
in the tournament, while Belkin and
-lacobson moved on to quarterfinal

round of the consolation bracket.
, ln a close match, Belkin and Ja-

cobson pulled out a 7-6, 6-3 nailbiter V

over Penn‘s Barb Sutton and Angie
Roscli. The Lady Panthers con-
tinued to roll in the semis,‘ knocking
off Colgate‘s‘No. l team, Theresa
Besson and Joan Freedman, 6-2, 6-
2. .

In the finals, Jacobson and Belkin
fell to Syracuse’s Linda Gottlieb and
Dian Sivacec 6-l, 6-2 to take sixth
place overall in the tournament.
Dieffenbach called Belkin and Ja-
cobson’s finish “one of the high
points of the season.”

“It was the highest we’ve ever‘
placed in the East, and the tourna-
ment encompassed a lot of teams. It
was the biggest tournament of the
year in the East, going against all the
major superpowers,” Dieffenbach
said. “The team hasn’t‘ been winning
much, but Cathy and Randi have
been playing well all season.“

Buoyed by the pair's strong finish

at New Paltz, Dieffenbach is now
setting his sights on the Association
for intercollegiate Athletics for
Women nationals next spring. He’d
like to see Belkin and Jacobson win
a berth.

“They‘ve been playing together
for three years and they really know
each other well. One player sets up
the other player,” Dieffenbach said.
“They just keep getting stronger and
stronger and stronger.“

As do Pitt's hopes fora represen-

tative at nationals this spring. Dic-
fenbach is betting doubles or
nothing. M
