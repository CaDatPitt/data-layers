Ref called an ‘unnecessary roughness’

Pitt band member alleges line judge struck her before Saturday’s Pitt-Notre Dame game

A female member of Pitt’s band
was allegedly punched in the head by a
‘line judge at the Pitt—Notre Dame foot-
ball game last Saturday, and was sent to
the. hospital because of the resulting
injuries, Pitt officials said yesterday.
According to Pitt spokesman Ken
Service, a woman on Pitt’s marching
band, whose name was unavailable as of
last night, has charged a line judge at the
Saturday afternoon football game with

The University of Pittsburgh,
which last week asked the

Pennsylvania legislature for nearly
$l00 million in its 1998-99 capital-
budget request, has some big plans.
Plans as big as the Cathedral of
Learning, a convention center and a
new basic-science center combined;
to be precise. .

The budget request, as submit-
ted to the state, asks for $25 million
to construct a basic—science center,
$20 million for renovations to the
Cathedral of Learning, and $25 mil-
lion for a new convocation center.

According to Pitt spokesman
Ken Service, the requests are part
of a long-term reconstruction plan
for the University.

The request also includes $24
million for a list of building
upgrades and renovations on cam-
pus.

The science-building request
has been a long-standing University
proposal, Service said. The build-
ing —-— which Pitt officials expect
will be approximately 100,000

‘square feet‘—— would house class-
rooms, offices, laboratories and a
library.

Pitt is hoping to get a commit-
ment from the state before proceed-
ing any further with plans to build
the science center.

Service said current plans for
the center are at such an early stage

Pitt’s $100 million dream:
  to build a better campus

the Cathedral include a new fire-

simple assault.

The incident occurred moments
after the Pitt band completed its
pregame performance in front of 47,306
fans and began marching toward the
sidelines.

The line judge and three Notre
Dame football captains — who were
separated by the snaking line of band
members from the center of the field-
where the coin toss takes place —-— began
to shove their way through the proces-
sion. As the four individuals forced
themselves through the ranks, the young

that no name, location or architect
have yet been chosen for the build-
ing. He said the facility would
house some of the science programs
currently located in Allen Hall,
Thaw Hall, Old Engineering Hall
and \ the Space Research
Coordination Center.

Associate Provost Bob Pack
said the University’s science build-
ings, which are among the older
buildings on campus, are beginning
to show the wear and tear of sever-
al decades of use. He said a new
major science center has been a
“long-term need” for the campus.

The requested money also
includes plans to repair the 60-year-
old Cathedral of Learning, which
officials say doesn’t meet 1997
building standards.

The improvements planned for

suppression system, air condition-
ing throughout the building, alter-
ations to conform with the
Americans with Disabilities Act,
and extensive renovations to the
elevators. Small repairs, such as
patching holes in the plaster walls
in the building’s two staircases,
would also be made with the state
aid.

Service said the renovations
would meet both the building’s aca-
demic and administrative needs.

The $24 million that the

woman was punched in the head.

“She indicated to the Pitt police, at
the time, that the line judge was respon-
sible for that,” Service said.

“The woman was later sent to the
University of Pittsburgh Medical
Center’s emergency room, where she
was treated and released.

Service said the three Notre Dame
captains for Saturday ’s game — quarter-
back Ron Powlus, linebacker Melvin
Dansby and strong safety/kick returner
Allen Rossum —— have not been named
in the allegation.

Pitt police records show that a
report was ﬁled at the time of the attack
and that the woman will press charges.

An athletics department spokesman,
Ron Wahl, said he did not know any
details about the assault other than
“there was an incident.” He said the Pitt
police are currently investigating the
matter and Pittsburgh city police are not
involved.

Several members of the band were
contacted last night but declined to com-
ment. Athletics Director Steve Pederson
could not be reached.

Scott Kruger, a Phi Gamma Delta
pledge at MIT, died this month after he was
found unconscious in his own vomit from
an alcohol overdose.

Benjamin Wynne, a Sigma Alpha
Epsilon pledge at Louisiana State
University, died in August from alcohol poi-
soning after a fratemity “Bid Night.”

In November 1994, Attif Bhatti, a Delta
Sigma Phi brother 'at'Pitt, died on his 21st
birthday trying to do “the 21-gun salute” ——
a round of 2] shots of hard liquor.

The possibility of dying from a hard
night of dr'mkingdoesn’t cross most stu-

dents’ minds on a Friday night, but these
recent deaths are proof that it’s more possi-
ble than one may think.

“There are so many students that
drink,” said Robert Gallagher, interim vice
chancellor for student affairs. "There are
psychologically healthy students that go
through a binge-drinking phase and go on to
lead healthy lives, but those who do not
[progress] from this phase develop prob-
lems.” _

Pitt’s alcohol policy states that students
under 2] caught in the residence halls pos-
sessing or consuming alcoholic beverages
will either pay a fine or be referred to the

12-year-old girl raped in her
home while parents sleep  

Across the Nation

WAUSAU, Wis. — Her parents were sleep-
ing in a nearby room, as a 12-year-old girl
was raped in their Wisconsin home.

Police say they’re looking for a man

who entered the unlocked home and raped,

the girl in her bed. I

They say the girl didn’t scream or tell
her parents until morning —— because the
attacker threatened her.

The Wausau police chief thinks it’s log-
ical to think the attacker had some knowl-
edge of the .-victim and her family, but says
investigators don’t yet have a suspect.

SANTA MONICA, Calif. — The San
Bernardino area of Southern California has
been rocked by an earthquake with a prelime
inary magnitude of 4.0.

Seismologist Kate Hutton of the
California Institute of Technology says it
was not an aftershock to another quake.

There are no initial reports of damage.

MIAMI — There’s a court motion that’s
threatening a $300—1nillion settlement
reached by ﬂight attendants and the tobacco
industry.

lawyer Eric Olsen has asked to inter-
vene in this case, saying that the deal doesn’t
forcethe tobacco companies to admit that
secondhand smoke is deadly. He represents
a Dallas ﬂight attendant.

A lawyerfor the group of plaintiffs says
Olsen is simply trying to cash in on the $49
millionin legal fees attached to the settle-
ment. »

PACIFIC GROVE, Calif. — John
Denver’s lawyer says as far as he knows,
Denver had a valid pilot’s license at the time
of the crash that killed him. But federal
investigators say Denver’s license wasn’t
valid — because he had been arrested twice
on drunk—driving charges.

PHILADELPHIA —— The University of
Pennsylvania plans to lay off about 1'3’
white—collar employees overseeing mainte-

nance operations. University oﬂicials say the

managers will be replaced by contracted

workers from the Trarnrnell Crow

Company, based in Dallas, Texas. They say

the managers can interview for jobs at

PITTSBURGH — A man accused of

radio says it was self—defense. Dennis

Students are unlikely to be expelled for
alcohol consumption, even if they are repeat
offenders. ,

‘There is always a question if the fines
are high enough or if PEAR is effective, but
it is unwise to just dismiss students because
of drinking,” Gallagher said. '

Dr. Shirley Haberman, health—educa—
tion administrator at Student Health, says
that even though Pitt has its fair share of
drinkers, there are factors that make the
University’s alcohol consumption lower.

“Westem Pennsylvania is more conser-
vative, and Pitt’s urban location offers other
alternatives. to drinking,” explained
Haberrnan. “Also, there is little access to
alcohol in grocery stores and gasoline sta-
tions, and most bars close at 2 a.m.”

Both Gallagher and Haberrnan agree,
though, that the majority of alcohol prob-
lems occur with freshmen and in the Greek
community.

As most students know, it is somewhat
a “freshman tradition” in Oakland to show
bouncers their Pitt ID in hopes it will suffice
for a driver’s license.

Unlike bars in the past, such as Zelda’s,
that lost their liquor license because of sales
to minors, bar owners now require drinkers’

proof of age.

“Most of the time you can tell who’s
underage by the way they act,” said Eric
Rodgers, a bartender at C.J. Barney’s. “They
look away, get jittery, and giggle with their
friends.”

1 Paul Levine, who is now a senior, said
he had no problems getting into C.J.’s when
he was underage.

“I either used my fake ID or I sneaked
in through the back door,” said Levine.

While local bars try to eliminate under-
age drinkers, many fratemities are trying to

‘ improve their reputations, especially follow-

ing the recent deaths of the fraternity pledges
at MIT and LSU.

“When you think about how many stu—
dents drink, you have to wonder why more
incidents aren’t reported,” said Michael
Levenstein, president the Pitt chapter of
Alpha Epsilon Pi. “It only scents to make
the news when it happens in a fratemity or
soronty.”

Levenstein said he is proud of the way

Berardi urged students to apply early.

Daley. “But most of the time, problems at

for the project. This would bring
Pennsylvania’s contribution to slight-
ly over 80 percent of the current esti-
mated $52—million cost for the arena.

Tim Reeves, spokesman for
Governor Ridge, said Ridge has not
yet decided and that the outcome of
the current capital-budget proposals
remain to be determined.

Service noted that the money Pitt
is asking for the project is compara-
ble to what other state institutions,
such as Temple and Penn State
Universities, requested for similar
projects.

All such requests are submitted to
the state legislature, and the state
decides whether to include the fund-
ing in Pennsylvania’s capital-budget
bill. The bill is then passed on to
Governor Ridge’s office, where he
line-items certain projects for final
approval. '

Money for the proposal will be
allocated if and when the governor
authorizes the plan.

Reeves said, however, that the
Ridge administration is concerned
that letting Pitt out of the agreement
may open the ﬂoodgates for other
organizations that accepted smaller
sums and may now want more
money.

“I can’t foreshadow what’s going
to happen,” Reeves said. “We’re still
talking with the University on the
broad subject of capital-gains need.”

should be priority  

If Pitt wants to admit so many new students and
increase its enrollment, it had better start thinking about
building a new dorm.

Pitt is lobbying Harrisburg for almost $100 million
to build a convocation center and a new science build-
ing, and to renovate the Cathedral and several other
buildings. While all these changes are necessary, they
show a huge error in the University’s priorities.

You don’t build a convocation center and the
umpteenth science building if your purpose is to make
this University more attractive to students. Nobody is

going to come here only so, four years later, they can '

walk to graduation instead of driving or taking a bus.

If you want students to come and to stay here, give
them someplace to live.

This year’s freshman class is the largest ever because
more freshmen than usual enrolled after Pitt accepted
them. Many only enrolled because the housing deadline
was extended by a month, so they expected they would
have someplace to live when they got here. Pitt pur-
posefully allowed more students to move on campus
than it needed. It admitted more than it had space for.

Pitt cannot continue to do that and expect enrollment
to stay up. It will be surprising if many students don’t
transfer out after April simply because they didn’t like
the living conditions.

If students don’t leave en masse, then this housing
problem will last for several years, even if Pitt doesn’t
keep extending the housing deadline every year.

University officials need to understand the differ-
ence between quantity and quality. For people used to
equating success with dollar ﬁgures, this may not come
easily to our administrators. But if they want Pitt to be a
ﬁrst-class institution, it is something they will have to
learn.

Nuzzo goes Postal on modern video games

I couldn’t make out many of the

dropped to knees: “Kill me now!”

The assailant looked at him with-

The nine year-old put down the

The game derives its name from

The premise of this hot-selling

Global warming
is not imaginary

In the Oct. 13 issue of The Pitt News,
Paul Clark made the assertion that global
warming does not exist. The views he pre-
sents are based on an incorrect analysis of
climate change data. Let’s look at the
major evidence: Burning fossil fuels pro-
duces carbon dioxide which is known

0 without a doubt to be a cause for the green-

house effect.

He makes the false argument that sev-
eral winters ago, much of the Northeast
experienced much lower—than—average
temperatures. A distinction between
weather and climate has to made here.
Weather is what’s happening in the atrnos-
phere in a particular place and time.
Climate is the average weather that a place
experiences over time. The weather in
Pittsburgh for that January might have
been very cold, but the climate for that year
was well within the norms.

Most of the world’s scientists agree
that global change is real and a major
threat. In 1995, using the work of 2,500

    

scientists from around. the world, the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change issued a report stating that “the
balance of evidence suggests that there is a
discernible human inﬂuence on global cli-
mate.” Translation: Top researchers have
said that we are messing up the climate.
Business and industry in the United
States claim that new emission standards
would hurt them in the worldwide market,
costing them thousands of dollars in the
short-term. But current predictions show
that the major wheat-producing areas of
the U.S. will shift upwards to Canada with-
in the next 60 years, taking away a good

' share of our export market. Other effects of

global warming could be severe weather
pattern changes, ecosystem change, sea
level rise, and increased rates of disease
and famine. These effects will cost the

On the front page of the Oct. 14 edi-

over. half of the article explaining the ins
and outs of statue restoration. If this is rep-
resentative of The Pitt News, reporting for
the paper is in trouble. How about address-
ing the question as to WHY someone

Wednesday, 15 October 1997

might do such a thing? Oh excuse me, that
was covered by the quote, “some people
have nothing better to do than destroy
things.”

The celebration of Columbus Day is
worthy of discussion here. We celebrate a
man who upon being welcomed and show-
ered with gifts by the Arawak people of the
Bahama Islands in 1492 later wrote in his
log, “They do not bear arms  they would
make ﬁne servants  with ﬁfty men we
could subjugate them all and make them
do whatever we want.” Even the Harvard
historian, the most distinguished writer on
Columbus, Samuel Morison writes in his
complimentary book “Christopher
Columbus, Mariner” that “the cruel policy
initiated by Columbus and pursued by his
successors resulted in complete genocide
[of the Arawaks].”

Perhaps in a college newspaper we
should not expect reporting on controver-
sial issues over paint removal techniques.
If this is true, perhaps we shouldn’t bother
to read anything other than the Sports page

and the Police Blotter.

A witer’s plea

for more grass
on campus  

Take a look at Penn State, Florida,
Nebraska, Michigan, or any of the nation’s
top football schools, and notice the surface
on which they play. '

Grass. Football was not meant to be
played on carpet.

When the new administration took con-
trol of the Pitt football program its goal was
to bring Pitt back to the level of these
schools, and obviously a lot more goes into
that than the playing srnface.

Itwouldbeniceiftheprocesswasas .

simple as hiring Steve Pederson, having him
tearuptheturfinPitt Stadium, plantafew

seeds, and then, abracadabra, the Panthers _

are in the Top 10. It’s not that easy, but I

thinkputtingnaturalgrassinthestadium

would be a positive step in helping the pro
gram reach that status.

1 Let’s stop and envision a classic, blood-
and—guts football clash; maybe Penn State
versus Michigan, battling for the top spot in
the Big 10. .

Imagine 100,000 drunken screaming
fans crammed into Beaver Stadirnn on a
crisp fall afternoon. Picture the sea of blue
and white shirts in the stands uniting in a
deafening “We are . . . Penn State” chant as
legendary Football Coach Joe Patemo
patrols the sidelines.

The sound of the both schools’ ﬁght
songs echoes throughout the immense struc-
ture as the rush of emotion builds up and
ﬁnally climaxes when the kicker runs up to
boom a towering kickoff to start the contest.

Now imagine the same situation played
on synthetic plastic carpet. It doesn’t quite
have the same allure, does it? .

(Especially when you consider Pitt’s
chances of having a booming kickoff.)

Don’t get me wrong, a natural grass
ﬁeld isn’t going to make or break the pro-
gram, but maintaining a grass ﬁeld one of
those little things that the top-notch organi-
zations do. It’s the collection of these little
things that_creates that ﬁne margin between
the truly elite programs and everything else.

Obviously, the formula for putting
together a Top 10 team involves a lot, and it
appears that with Pederson and Walt Harris,
the right people are in place to lead Pitt back
to the top of the college football world.

But brilliant football minds and a dili-
gent work ethic can only take you so far
without top-notch talent. And the only way
to bring in the blue-chip players is recruiting.

Harris himself says that recruits buy
with their eyes. Let’s hypothesize that the
local high school phenom, we’ll call him

Cross country's Francy follows her own path

Geoff Moak

Staff Wrlter

Give Amy Francy credit for being

a honest. The senior cross country runner

doesn’t ﬁt the mold of most student-
athletes_ and isn’t afraid to admit it.

She didn’t come to Pitt because of
its athletics program, or even for acade-
mic reasons.

She liked the
Learning.

Growing up in Steubenville, Ohio,
about 45 minutes from Pittsburgh,
Francy and her family made some trips
into Oakland every so often. Francy
explained her reaction as the family car
motored through the Pitt campus.

“Coming into Oakland, I would
always see the Cathedral at the end of
Forbes Avenue, and I thought that was
so neat,” Francy said. “I said ‘I want to
go here.’ This was when I was probably
13 or 14. I didn’t know a whole lot
about Pitt. I didn’t really know a lot
about anything.”

Francy’s preference in colleges did-
n’t change over the next ﬁve years, but
her choice of sports did. Francy took the
rather. unconventional route of going

Cathedral of

‘ cross country.

from basketball to track, and then to

Her speed on the basketball court is
what got her high-school track coach’s
attention. _ .

“I went out for thetrack team in the
spring of my freshman year, and I did
well. I didn’t run long distances. I did
the 100 and 200 [meter racesj,” Francy
said. “I started running cross country
my sophomore year because my track
coach thought it would be good for me
to get some strength.”

Making a sprinter run distance
races is usually considered one step
away from Chinese water torture, but
Francy made the transition to longer
races fairly smoothly. '

“I didn’t have to push myself very
hard to do well. It was just natural,” she
said of her ﬁrst cross country season.

Still, she was a sprinter on the track.
It took an injury to a teammate in
Francy’s senior year of high school for
her to get a chance at running distance
races on the track —-— something she

_does here for the Panther track team.

“I don’t have the speed I used to
have in shorter distances,‘ like the 200
and 400, meters. My 800 [meter] time

has improved dramatically since high
school. Mymile time has dropped by
over 25 seconds,” Francy said. “I like
both track and cross country. I’m prob-
ably more talented in track.”

Her cross country times have
improved signiﬁcantly over the years as
well. Between her freshman and junior
years at Pitt, she took nearly 1:40 off
her time on the course at Franklin Park
in Boston —-— one of two sites that has
hosted the Big East championship meet.

“She continues to get better every
year,” said Dave’ Sobal,_ Pitt’s cross
country head coach. “It took a while for
her conversion from sprinting to the
longer races, but as she gets stronger, all
her races get faster each year.”

Her improvement in cross country
has made her Pitt’s top female runner
this season. Francy has run each race
faster than the last one so far this fall. In
Pitt’s ﬁrst race of the season, Francy
placed third in a meet at Kent State,
running the ﬁve kilometer (just over

5 three miles) race in 20:06. She suffered

an injury that week and missed a race,
but has come back even faster, running
her next two races in under 19:30.

The Ultimate Force IX competition
last month was only the beginning. A
bench press of over 500 pounds accom-
panied by booming grunts was only the
beginning.‘The judges’ intense scrutiny
on each competitor’s attempt was only
the beginning.

George Panzak, exercise physiolo-
gist and U.S. Weightlifting Federation
coach, wants to bring the excitement of
powerlifting competition I to the
University of Pittsburgh on a regular
basis. Panzak is currently planning the
Panther Weightlifting Club, which has
its first meeting Thursday, Oct. 23 at
8:00 p.m. on the first floor of the
William Pitt Union. .

Panzak wants to bring nationals and
the world championships to Pittsburgh,
and involve Pitt students in the various
lifting events.

“I can take the students as far as they
want to go. The students are the focus
here,” Panzak said. I

He also said the interest is here at the
University.

“I was at the Student Activities fair.
I’ve already got three full legal pads of
interested people,” Panzak said. “The
idea is if we get the students organized
then go to [Athletics Director] Steve
Pederson, that’s the key.”

Panzak explained that there is more
to the club than just lifting.

“It’s not just about getting stronger,
but also character, self—esteem. I like to
call it the student—athlete—citizen [pro-
gram],” said Panzak.

According to Panzak, the club’s

Vllednesday, 15 October 1997

 

  Call to rs for Panther lifters

structure — president, vice—president,
and the like -— also provides leadership
opportunities for students. The club will
have event—officiating openings for the
students as well.

The registered club will also provide
a competitive weightlifting team as its
own entity within the club. This beneﬁts
the more serious competitor, according
to Panzak. All levels of competition can
be offered —— including novice, interme-
diate and advanced. '

Within the levels of competition
there are three features of lifting: power-
lifting, weightlifting and bodybuilding.
This gives the athlete a chance to choose
an aspect of lifting to pursue.

Panzak wants to have sanctioned
meets for the club, with an intramural
competition possibly as early as
November. National events are held
between June and July, along with state
meets in March. All local events occur in
the fall.

In order to have a sanctioned meet,
the USA Weightlifting Federation must
approve the meet. A branch—off of the
U.S. Olympic Committee, this organiza-
tion can provide national officials and
top talent for the events — events that
would only be made possible through
the club.

Panzak teaches a weightlifting,
powerlifting and bodybuilding class here
at the University. The class currently has
12 students and meets once a week. He
is also involved with drug and alcohol
research studies currently underway at
Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic.

“A big part of the sport is scientific
training. Many people don’t realize
that,” Panzak said.

FRANCY

So far, this year is shaping up to be
the pinnacle of Francy’s running career
at Pitt. But the Panther team, on the other
hand, has struggled as a whole. It’s not
an easy situation to be in, and Francy
strained to find the words to talk about it.

“Cross country is a team sport, but
it’s made up of individuals. I wish that
we had a stronger team, but there’s noth-
ing I can do about it except try to do my
best every race. That helps put the team
ahead,” she said.

Most of the benefits Francy has
found from cross country really don’t
have much to do with running at all.

“Being an athlete is better than
being an average student. You feel you
have a purpose here,” she said. “I’ve
made a lot of friends. I don’t just mean
acquaintances, I mean people that I
know intimately. I’ve gotten to go a lot
of places that I never would have gone
to. I’ve gained time management skills.”

Her coach agrees.

“I think she could give lessons to

mom PAGE 7

anyone on campus in balancing her pri-
orities,” Sobal said.

Ironically, Francy questions her own
priorities.

Unlike most students, she says she
doesn’t see herself as a student first any-
more. Still, she has plans to eventually
go to earn a master’s degree in nursing.
If anyone has the work ethic to make it,
it’s Francy.

“She has an exemplary academic
record, and she works very, very hard at
her sport too,” Sobal said.

Francy hopes to graduate from Pitt
and then work for a few years, continu—
ing to run in a few of her favorite road
races, before going back to graduate
school.

It wouldn’t be the typical route to a
degree, much like it is not typical to
move from basketball to long-distance
running, or to base a college choice on
the size of the campus’s largest building.

In other words, it would be a route
that would suit Francy perfectly.

Runners’ first, only home meet

set for Saturday cit Schenley

Geoff Moak

Staff Writer

It’s the week that the Pitt men’s and
women’s cross country teams have been
looking forward to all season.

This ‘ Saturday afternoon is the
Duquesne Invitational cross country meet
at Schenley Park. It may be named for

- another local university, but Schenley Park

is also Pitt’s home course. Saturday’s com-
petition is the only home meet of the sea-
son for the Panthers. ,

This annual event has traditionally
been a small one. The 1997 version won’t
be huge, but it will be bigger than it has
been in the past. ,

Thirteen women’s teams and 10 men’s
teams are planning to compete. Teams will
come from as far away as ‘Montclair, N.J.,
(Montclair State University) and Buffalo,
N.Y., (Canisius College) to race.

The meet will also have a strong local

. ﬂavor. Four Pittsburgh colleges, Pitt,

Duquesne, Robert Morris and Carnegie
Mellon will be represented. Carnegie
Mellon’s men and women are both nation-
ally rarrked Division 111 teams.

The most intriguing aspect of the race
for Pitt will be racing against Duquesne’s

men. The teams have raced several times
this season, and the Panthers have yet to

ﬁnish ahead of Duquesne, but the gap has
. shrunkeach time. I

.“We have some goodteams /coming.
The weather is supposed to cooperate,”
Head Coach Dave Sobal said. “It should
be a good meet.” ’ C '

The Panthers’ last meet was at ‘Lehigh
University two weeks ago. That meet was
dorrrinated by teams that are national

championship contenders. Teams like Pitt '

were buried back in the pack. Unlike that
meet, the Panthers should be competitive
on their home turf. V

“We’ve been rounding into form as a
team. I think we could walk out of that
meet winning both races,” Sobal said.

The gun is scheduled to go off at 12:15
Saturday v afternoon for the men’s race,
with the women starting when the men fm—
ish. Both races start at the Schenley Park
oval.

After this race, the Panthers go on the
road again, traveling to Van Cortlandt Park
in New York for the Big East
Championships. That race takes place on
Halloween, and is the squad’s last event
before, NCAA qualiﬁers take place on
Nov. 15 at Penn State.

Bubba, is deciding between Pitt and Penn
State.

Chances are that Bubba watched the
Penn State—Michigan game described earli-
er. Either subconsciously or consciously, he
took note of the beautiful natural—g1ass sur-
face.

Now let’s say Bubba comes on a
recruiting visit to Pitt. When the coaches
take him around to show him the playing
facilities, Pitt’s artiﬁcial turf is not going to
have the same mystique as the nicely
groomed grass at Penn State. Nor will it do
wonders for Bubba’s knees.

A lot of factors are going to go into.

Bubba’s college decision, but those little
things are what get the big—time colleges
those few extra players that put them ahead.

Not only do recruits buy with their eyes,
but so do fans. A natural-grass ﬁeld would
create a better football setting at Pitt Stadium
(some more parking wouldn’t hurt either),
and fans would be increasingly likely to
come out and watch a game. That translates
into the more of the mighty dollar for the ath-
letics department.

In the past, the primary argument
against grass has been that there’s too much
wear and tear on the Pitt Stadium ﬁeld.
Setting football aside, men’s soccer,
women’s soccer, intramural football, intra-
mural soccer, and the Pitt Band all practice
and play on the ﬁeld.

But not many people know that tucked
neatly behind Sutherland‘Hall is the Cost
Center complex ——-, an indoor turf facility as

well as an outdoor baseball ﬁeld and two
outdoor, full-size soccer ﬁelds.

At the very least, intramural sports
could be played there. There is no reason the
band can’t also hold practices at Cost.

If the presence of both soccer teams’

would still be too damaging to a grass ﬁeld
in the stadium, then they, too, could practice
at the Cost Center. f '

It might be a sacriﬁce on the soccer
team’s behalf, but the well-being of the
entire athletics department, including the
soccer programs, depends on the success of
the football program. And if moving prac-
tices to the Cost Center means more success
for the program, they should be happy to
oblige. ‘ .
The new administration_ has excelled in
the off—the—ﬁeld work which, given the state
of the athletics department, is just as impor-
tant to resurrecting Pitt football as the on-the-
ﬁeld success.

Unveiling ‘the new uniforms was a
tremendous boost for both school spirit and
the athletics department’s check book.
Landing'Adidas and Champion to sponsor
Pitt’s athletic gear also means more cash. A
strong advertising campaign and a commit-
ment to make each game more of an “event”
have generated fan interest.

These accomplishments in such a short
period of time are very impressive. I think
spending some money to put a grass ﬁeld in
the stadium would prove to be another huge
plus for the program and take Pitt one step
closer to that elusive Top 10 status.

on us.” .

Harris admitted that the bye week
before the Temple game gave the Panthers
too much time to think about how good
they were. “With all the positive
press and attention, I think the team got a
little too wrapped up in what people were
saying about them,” said Harris.

The positive attention has declined
recently, giving Pitt a chance to concentrate
on some of its trouble spots. The kicking
game has been a focal point, and the defen-
sive line has been revamped, with tight end
John Jones switching to the other side of
the line.

Pittsburgh’s glaring weakness. in
Sat11rday’s loss was the play of the special
teams. Two kickoffs were returned for
touchdowns: the opening kick and an
onside kick late in the game. The opening
kick was meant to be a high lob over the
retumer’s head, but instead it was kicked
right at him, and after a momentary fumble
he returned it for a touchdown.

Pitt also misseda short ﬁeld goal when

the score was 14-0. This miss handed back .

the momentum to the Irish after a Pitt inter-
ception by Hank Poteat returned the ball to

   
 
 
  
  
 
   
 
  
  
 
 
 
  
  
  
  
 
   
   
  
 
 

 

the 9-yard line.

The punting average was acceptable,
but a couple of crucial miscues gave Miami
excellent ﬁeld position late in the game.

“Their deep men are some of the best
in the country, but our specialists just need
to do a better job,” said Harris. “We have to
go with them because we don’t have a
choice. They just have to try and get better.
That’s all we can hope for.”

As for the defense, the junior Jones has
voluntarily decided to switch his 6—foot-5,
240—pound frame from starting tight end to
defensive end. In ﬁve games this year, he
has grabbed ﬁve passes for 39 yards and
one touchdown.

Jones has been plagued throughout his
career by dropped passes. This was no
more evident than in the Notre Dame
game, when he dropped a sure touchdown
and another pass later in the game.

But Harris said that wasn’t the reason
for the change.

“He expressed interest in switching a
couple of weeks ago,” said Ham's. “He has
the size and the speed, and we think he can
play there. You win championships on
defense, and if he wants to move to
defense, we will let him.”

Jones’ switch to defense may have also
been prompted by the injuries to an already

thin defensive line. Defensive tackle Frank two-week hiatus of the season will be run

Moore is doubtful for the Rutgers game
with an injured left I
knee.

At the time of his
injury, Moore led all
Pitt defensive linemen
in tackles, tackles for
loss, and sacks. His
absence was evident in
Pitt’s last two games,
in which Temple and
Notre Dame trampled
Pitt’s defense for a
combined 542 rushing
yards. Yesterday "at
practice, Moore was
running sprints (in
shorts and a T-shirt) at
near full speed with lit-
tle problem.

“It hurt our defensive line to lose the
one player who is playing the best,” said

- Harris. “I don’t know when he’ll be back.

Right now we want him to get used to his
knee and to become more confident on it.”

Moore wasn’t the only one under-
dressed — the Panthers practiced in just
helmets and sweat suits, but still went
through a rigorous conditioning segment to
end practice. Harris said the team’s second

the same way as was the ﬁrst between the
Miami and Temple
games, except for
some coaches’
absence, which will
cut down on practice
time.

“We have seven
less coaches out here
right now because
they are doing recruit-
ing trips for us, so we
won’t be able to get as
much done,” said
Harris. “We are going
to work hard in these
two weeks and hope-
fully come out and
play hard, against
Rutgers.”

Hanis also spoke about freshman run-
ning back Kevan Barlow, who got some

playing time on Saturday for an injured —

Billy West. West injured his shoulder when
he was knocked hard to the turf in the
Temple game. Barlow scored a touch-
down, but also had a fumble late in the
game on a handoff rniscue. I

“Barlow did a nice job,” said Harris.
“He’s gaining some valuable experience.”
