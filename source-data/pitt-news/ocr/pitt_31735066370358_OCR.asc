Funding

shortage

looms over SGB

By Pamela Underwood
Special to The Pitt News

For the first time in years, Pitt’s Stu-
dent Government Board is facing
challenges which will signiﬁcantly af-
fect its ability to meet the funding
«demands of certified student
;organizations.

According to Dr. Terrance Milani,
associate director of Student Activities
and advisor to the Allocations Commit-
tee, “The situation this year is serious.
Total budget requests exceed the
amount of funds available for alloca-
tion by more than 212 percent.”

Speciﬁcally, the SGB receives
$300,000 in student activity fees to
allocate to approximately 125 student
organizations. Of this initial ﬁgure,
$30,000, or 10 percent, is reserved for
fall term emergency requests. These
are requests that were omitted from or
are in addition to the approved budget
requests. This reserve is also used for
those groups who did not submit an-

’ nual budgets but wish to receive fund-

ing. Of the 125 student organizations,
about 90, or 72 percent, submitted
budgets by the Feb. 7, 1986 deadline;
the other 28 percent have yet to request
funds.

Seemingly, $270,000 is available for
funding. But of this amount, $64,592
or 21.5 percent of the original
$300,000 ﬁgure must be used for
overhead expenses. These expenses in-
clude ofﬁce supplies for student
groups, student remunerations,
telephone expenses, stafﬁng for the stu-
dent organizations’ ofﬁce complex
(located on the ﬁfth ﬂoor of the
William Pitt Union) and copies for
SGB administrative purposes.

So in actuality, $205,408 or 68.5

percent of the initial $300,000 is
available to allocate to the student
groups.

Of the remaining allocatable funds,
the seven governing student groups

(those groups recognized by the vice_

president for Student Affairs) have re-

quested a total of $208,251 or 101.4

percent of the available funds.
“These groups serve large constitu-

encies and conduct programming‘

which, combined, has the widest ap-
peal to Pitt’s undergraduate ‘popula-
tion," said Jim Mumma, SGB presi-
dent. “But the SGB realizes that the
non—goveming groups, in many cases,
are better able to provide a forum for
more specialized programming to Pitt
students, and they should receive
equitable consideration during the
budgeting process.”

The non-govemance groups have re-
quested $228,038, which amounts to
approximately 11.1 percent of the
available funds. Combined, all certiﬁed
organizations have requested $436,298
or 212.4 percent of the funds available
for allocation.

And so, the attempt to balance a ‘

clearly disproportionate budget is
underway. To achieve this goal, the
Allocations Committee follows a set of
guidelines which are listed in an alloca-
tions manual, printed annually to assist
students in the development of their
budgets. The manual describes the
allocations process in detail and in-
dicates those items which can and can-
not be ﬁmded with student activity fees.
Further, it describes the criteria by
which program requests are evaluated.

‘ ‘Subsequent to the policies and pro-
cedures outlines in the allocations
manual, the Allocations Committee and
SGB must adopt additional practices to
further guide decision making in a con-

practices are decided upon after an
assessment of the SGB’s ﬁnancial situa-

As a result, certain areas of the
overall operating budget (those funding
requests which do not include in-
dividual programs sponsored by
groups) will be affected. These areas
include: advertising and refreshment
requests for recruitment programs;
organization travel expenses for con-
ventions; and expenses for trips involv-
ing large numbers of group members.

More importantly, the SGB will have
to make decisions on a high priority
basis. “Taking this year’s budget con-
straints into account, the SGB will be
forced to make decisions on a higher
level than has been done in the past,”
Mumma said. “Unfortunately, the
SGB will be forced to cut worthwhile
programsiacross the board. We en-
courage student organizations to
prioritize their programs so that we can
fund the most important and essential
events. We also encourage student
groups to _be a little more self-

responsible and begin fundraising for»

ford to fund.”

Magee raises effort to
educate the public

By Stefanie Frelick
For The Pitt News

The Department of Education at
Magee-Womens Hospital has been in-
creasing its efforts to provide educa-
tion to the public in order to fulﬁll the
total health care process.

As part of one of the largest private
nonproﬁt obstetrical facilities in the

_ United States, the education department

began 12 years ago with just -a few

' general prenatal classes.

Today it offers 25 classes on a varie-
ty of topics. Some include: Preparing
for Pregnancy, Premenstrual Syn-
drome, Menopause and Grandparent
Discussion Groups.

According to Dr. Catherine Reon,
director of the education department,
“The bulk of classes available are
pregnancy-related since a large com-
ponent of Magee’s population is
obstetrics.”

But the program does not ignore the
need to address social issues.

“With the epidemic of adolescent
pregnancies and widespread sexually
transmitted diseases, we have begun an
entirely different series,” said Reon.
“They’re bound to obstetrics but
related to social responsibility.”
Women and Sexuality and Mothers and
Sons/Daughters Making Sense Out of
Sex are a few examples. V

Some of R'eon’s duties include ap-
proving, along with a review commit-
tee, any new classes and overseeing the

class instructors — all of whom must
be registered nurses.‘

R.N. at Magee who currently attends

“With the epidemic of
adolescent pregnancies
and widespread sexually
transmitted diseases, we
‘have began an entirely dif-
ferent series. ‘ They ’re
bound to obstetrics but
related to social resp0n—'
sibility. ”

A — Dr. Catherine Reon

graduate school at Pitt, is credited with
developing six classes in the program.

‘One class open to the community
free of charge is Taking Care of Your
Body, which she created and teaches.
In it, women are taught the purposes
of examinations given by physicians.
Preventive measures and self—exams
are also stressed. Marino said she
believes that this class is important
because the loss of health care in-
surance by the unemployed has had an
impact. '

“Women who had normally gone for
routine gynecological exams now can’t
afford it,” said Marino. “But if they
are taught to monitor the state of their
body, they’ll know when to see a doc-
tor.”

She also recently started an Infant
and Child CPR class. In the past, this
topic was part of adult CPR and re-
ceived little ‘attention, ‘said Marino.
Recently, however, the department saw
a need for people to learn the anatomy
and physiology of the heart and the

Police to
replace
emergency
phones

By Jack Burkman
Staff Writer

Pitt’s Department of Public Safety is

currently in the process of replacing all
of the push-button police phones on
campus.

p For the past few weeks, all of the
outdoor phones have been bolted shut.

Despite the inconvenience, according .

to Assistant Director Walter Waters,
there is no significant cause for alarm.
He urged Pitt's employees and students
to try to cope with the temporary
problem.

“We plan to have the phones work- ‘

ing again soon. Presently, we have
several problems,” said Waters.
“We’re getting newphones and a new
telecommunications system. and we’re
in the process of getting a new com-
puter and switching over lines.”

Jan Thomas, campus police lieuten— 1

ant for ﬁnancial services, said she feels

the new phones will be well worth the '

wait.

“In the past, we have had problems
because of poor reception,” said
Thomas. “We plan to correct this by

converting the push-to-talk phones in- ‘

to ones with regular receivers, and I
think everyone will be better served by
the new system.”

During this interim, the old phones,
according to Waters, have been bolted,

instead of merely disconnected and

abandoned, in order to save time in an
emergency situation. Waters said a stu-
dent might be falsely led to believe a
push-to-talk device was functioning if
it weren’t completely covered. Waters
said he wants people to proceed directly
to pay phones until the new system can
be implemented. For now, he said he
believes they can pick up at least some
of the slack.

“If you were in another part of Pitts-

burgh, the pay phone would be the only _

alternative,” said Waters. “The city

has had problems with vandalism and

thus got rid of its police phones.”
Pay phones, however, do not appear

to be perfect substitutes for direct lines ‘ '

to the campus police, according to one
Pitt student. On the evening of Feb. 7,-
a woman was struck by a car at the in-
tersection of Forbes Avenue and Big-
elow Boulevard. Student Steve Herer,
who witnessed the accident, went at
once to the nearest push-to-talk phone.
However, he found the unit out of
order.

“We had to use a pay phone and di-
al 911," Herer said. “Things were
slowed down; and it took longer for
the police to come.”

In this case, time was not a factor
because the victim sustained only very

minor injuries. Herer said he wonders _
'- how» the delay might have affected the

outcome of a more critical situation.

In the past, according to one campus
policeman, push-to-talk phones have
proven to be quite valuable.

“The phones are sensitive,” he said.
"There have been instances where
we’ve used them to monitor fights in
the streets.”

Iraq continues eounterattack

BAGDAD, Iraq — Iraqi forces killed
1,200 Iranians in overnight fighting,
but pouring rain slowed the counterof-
fensive on the Faw Peninsula. Conﬂict-

killing or wounding 400 Iraqis, and
Iraq littering battleﬁelds with bodies of
Iranian soldiers. Iran said it halted the
attack by smashing 45 Iraqi tanks and

Reagan wants more
contra aid

WASHINGTON — President Rea-
gan fired the first shot today in his bat-
tle with Congress to lift restriction on
military aid to the Nicaraguan rebels.
The president told Republican congres-
sional leaders that the rebels cannot
fight Cuban-piloted attack helicopters
with, as he put it, “Band-Aids and
mosquito nets.” Lawmakers said the
president will ask Congress for $100
million, $30 million for “humani-
tarian” aid and $70 million for “un—
restricted” assistance that could be
used to buy weapons.

Nicaraguan rebel leader Alfonso
Robelo warned that unless the U.S.
Congress gives his resistance army

\

more aid, the fight against the San-
dinista government could turn into what
he called a “sterile war,“ which would
result in many casualties and no win-
ners. Robelo said the money would go
to beef up his contra army offensive.
Robelo said, “This year, we will make
ourselves felt in urban centers.”

During their five-year struggle
against the Sandinista government, the
rebels have been unable to take or hold
a single city or mount a major attack
on an urban center, despite the millions
of dollars they’ve received from the
United States.

Israel looks for

kidnapped troops

JERUSALEM — Israeli forces have
driven more than a dozen miles north-
ward into Lebanon, backed by war-
planes and gunboats, in search of two
Israeli soldiers kidnapped by a Leb-
anese Moslem fundamentalist group
during an ambush. The guerrilla
leaders claim they killed four Israeli
soldiers in that attack.

Israeli military sources said the
troops encountered no resistance in the
search for the soldiers, but a Moslem

official said an Israeli patrol clashed
with Moslem guerrillas near the south-
ern port city of Tyre. The officials said
there were “heavy Israeli casualties.”

Shuttle engineers
opposed launch

 
 

WASHINGTON — The Senate
panel investigating the space shuttle
Challenger’s explosion opened hear-
ings yesterday. The head of the
presidential commission investigating
the tragedy was among those who ap-
peared before the Senate subcommit-
tee on Science, Technology and Space.
Besides former Secretary of State
William Rogers. ex-astronaut and
presidential commission member Neil
Armstrong and NASA shuttle chief
Jesse Moore are also scheduled to
testify.

Rogers asked NASA to bar anyone
involved in the decision to launch
Challenger from taking part in the
agency’s own proof of the disaster. Ac-
cording to CBS news reports, that re-
quest came after engineers with the
builder of the shuttle’s solid-fuel
booster rockets said they recommended
against the launch. The reports said the

The Pitt News, February 19, 1986

engineers were worried about the ef-
fects that cold weather might have had
on crucial rubber seals in the boosters.
Challenger was launched in 38—degree
weather after a night of sub—freezing
temperatures at Cape Canaveral.

CAIRO, Egypt — Egypt’s president
has sent a key adviser to talk with Jor-
dan’s King I-Iussein. The move by
Hosni Mubarak is an attempt to iron
out the differences between Jordan and
the PLO over a formula to bring the
terrorist organization into the Mideast

peace process. Talks between Hussein‘

and PLO chief Yassir Arafat stalled‘
after the PLO refused to accept U.N.

right to exist) unless the United States
recognizes the Palestinians’ right to
self—determination.

causes and preventions of cardiopul-
monary arrest in those most vulnerable
—~ infants and children’. Only six peo-
ple at a time can enroll, and they are
required to pass a written and manne-
quin test before becoming certified by
the American Heart Association.

Reon said she thinks this class
demonstrates the responsibility felt by
the department toward its patients/
consumers.

“Once someone delivers,” she said,
“we don’t just send them home from
the hospital, but we help them obtain
the parenting skills needed to complete
that job for the next 18 years.”

While a small fee is charged for most
of the classes, some given in the com-
munity are free because they are funded
by the women’s auxiliary. Class size
ranges anywhere from six to 130 peo-
ple, depending on the nature of the
topic.

In the three years she has headed the
department, Reon has played a major
role in the addition of new classes and
said she believes it is necessary to stay
on top of current health issues, thus be-
ing able to relay them to the public in
an instructive way.

In the near future, she said the
department plans to start a class on
osteoporosis —~ the most common form

of bone disease affecting elderly
women today. This is a perfect exam-
ple of how the education department of
Magee responds to the changing needs
of its commu’nity. ,

Today more than ever, the depart-
ment believes that well-informed peo-
ple will have more control over their
health.

“Especially in light of the many
governmental changes impacting on
hospitals today,” said Reon, “people
are going to be more and more respon-
sible for their own health care. So the
more they know going into a situation.
the faster the healing process will oc-
cur.”

PPC: Awash In The
Techno-Pop Gutter

The Pitt ‘ ‘Programming’ ’ Council continues
to reaffirm its bourgeois taste for Vapid talk-
show entertainment and relentlessly forces its
crude sensibilities upon the Pitt student body.
The corridors of the William Pitt Union nigh
resound with the oafish bellow, “and, here’s
Johnny,” as the mindless prattle of the likes
of Suzette Charles and James R. Peterson
drones on and on and on. Throw-away idols
of the pop/how—to culture all! The PPC’s
crowning achievment? Comedian Jay Leno
brings his boorish talents front and center to
Soldiers and Sailors Memorial on March 17
and proudly plays the buffoon for us all.

Mass media bludgeons us into embracing the
shallow forms of entertainment somewhere
deemed worthy for consumption and the PPC
seems all too willing to oblige it. Stupefied,
we too aquiesce and feign enjoyment, and yet,
does that restlessness mask discontent? Or,
rather is it a mere nervous habit performed
ritualistically to remind us of our dormant
vigor?

Beyond the impaired imagination of the
PPC, there does exist entertainment outside
of themainstream of the techno-pop gutter —

I gifted artists, musicians and orators; men and

women of merit, ideas and talent whose in-
telligence and integrity set them apart and mire
them sadly in obscurity. The PPC could work
to benefit the student body by enhancing our
education through exposure to elevating enter-
tainment rather than the “whitebread-bland-
tedium” it seems partial to.

Restricted Library
I would like to bring attention to the
fact that this university is not permit-
ting its students their full rights and
privileges while studying on campus.
The other evening I decided to study
at the law library. When I went to the
front entrance, there was a sign which
read: “Library restricted to those do-
ing legal research.” I proceeded to the
desk and attempted to sign in, since it
was the evening. The woman at the
desk asked me if I was doing legal
research. I said that I was studying.
Well, needless to say, I was not per-
mitted to study and was asked to leave.
I have never heard of being asked to
leave a library because I wasn’t doing
research that pertains to that library. I
recognize the law professionals need to
use the library, but I wouldn’t be get-

ting in their way, since it‘s such a big
library, and I would only be taking up
one space in it. I left feeling angry,
humiliated and frustrated. I am a nurs-
ing student, and anyone is allowed to
study in the nursing library when it’s
open — there are no restrictions as to
what major you are and what you are
doing there, and it is considered a
university library. The reason that I
wasn’t at the nursing library was that
it was closed when I wanted to study.

and so I figured that I could go there
— it’s close to the residence halls, and
any time I’ve gone before, it was no
problem. I don’t take food, I’m quiet,
and it’s never so crowded that I feel as
though I’m intruding in a law student’s
work, which is necessary in that
library.

I was very angry about the situation
at hand. If any law students want to
study in the nursing library, they are
free to do so without reservation. I
don’t feel that there was any grave
mistake in a student studying in a
university library.

Beyond Aesop

The rabbit hutch was on a farm in
Sussex, under the oak tree that stood
next to Farmer Jones’ shed. There
were eight rabbits inside, three males,
two females and three young ones.
For these white rabbits, life was a
very’ stagnant existence. They were
fed as often as Jones remembered and
were never let into the barnyard. .
Even worse, every spring Jones
separated the sexes, putting the males
into a smaller cage at the back of the
shed. This was the typical pattern of
life until one July evening when Jones
forgot to padlock the hutch.

This went unnoticed until Cap’n
John. the leader of the group, pointed
it out. Still the other seven continued
to ignore it. But after much time,
(rabbits being timid by nature), Cap’n
John persuaded the others to make a
dash for freedom with him. Spurred
on by visions of sweet clover and
fresh air, the animals pushed open the
hutch door and ran off into the near-
by pasture.

Morning found them in a sunny
field with a stream running nearby.
They_ celebrated their new-found
freedom and wondered how they had
ever lived without it. They vowed to
protect their liberty and promote it in
their meadow and beyond.

Another group of rabbits, brown
ones, settled across the stream. They,
also, were fond of the white rabbits’
idea of freedom. They were led by
agsmall rabbit named Philippe. He

of friends, and there were good times
for both clans. ,

After the first frost, the brown rab-
bits were plagued by attacks from
marauding foxes. The whites watched
and waited until one day the foxes
raided their colony. After a long
assembly, Cap’n John pledged his
support to Philippe’s group and swore
to help defeat the foxes. Over that
winter many battles occurred and
many rabbits died, until the foxes
gave up and went to look for easier
prey. All seemed peaceful in the
meadow. _

But while the rabbits fought, one
brown rabbit, Marcus, saw a chance
to take control of the clan. He
gathered followers and, on the eve of
the rabbits’ victory celebration, drove
Philippe and his family into the

_ woods.

Cap’n John and his colony were
very upset by this. But after Marcus
talked to Cap’n John, the clans
became friends again. Marcus told
him what a bad ruler Philippe was,
how Marcus himself had acted out of
concern for his people in exiling
Philippe. Cap’n John forgave him and
life continued on. Occasionally,
Cap’n John would hear rumors of
brown rabbits being forced to leave
or how Marcus's friends got the best
clover. But these things were forgot-
ten. The whites reasoned that every

' group had its malcontents.

But one day Philippe came back to

asked that the people be given a
choice to pick their leader. Marcus
agreed and set the date for the next
morning. But that night Philippe
disappeared, killed by a fox, Marcus
claimed. Some brave rabbits said that
Marcus had him killed, but both he
and Cap’n John refuted this. After all,
what evidence was there?

In the morning, the brown rabbits
assembled to make their choice, now
between Marcus and Philippe’s
brother. Those for Marcus met on the
right side; those for Philippe’s
brother on the left. At first, most
were on the left. But as they saw the
size of ‘Marcus’ escorts and their
stony stares, the right side grew.
Soon Philippe’s brother was alone on
the left. While the five sentinels
chased the lone rabbit down and
trampled him to death, Marcus con-
gratulated the rabbits on their wise
choice. He promised good times
ahead. But now they must all return
home, return home to work and to
build. Prosperity through labor, Mar-
cus exclaimed, as he ate some clover
brought to him by a servant.

The white colony watched all this
from across the stream, but few were
concerned. What could ever be
wrong? After all, there was plenty of
clover on their side of the stream.

. Cap’n John was already up on the hill
enjoying the warm sun a_nd eating
some. None noticed that there were

, more brown rabbits than white ones

and Cap’n John grew to be the closest

she no longer wanted to be anywhere

blowed-up astronauts and the derailing

it wasn’t a pop song, and people were
constantly talking about it, thus magni-

The Jig Is Up For Marcos In

Usually, art imitates life. Occa-
sionally, it’s the other way around. But
in the Philippines, there seem to.be no
distinctions at all. It would take a bad

. movie about a corrupt Asian republic

ruled _by a dissolute despot to even ap-
proximate what has happened in the last
several days. Please, switch the
channel. -

But no matter what channel you
chose last weekend, there was Ferdi-
nand Marcos’, as ubiquitous as a test
pattern, giving yet another interview in
which he claimed a victory that even
he must know is not there. In the paper
and on the tube, journalists reported the
incredible: Gunmen had run into poll-
ing places and seized ballot boxes. In
some towns, the results showed that not
a single person voted for Corazon
Aquino — not even her own
pollworkers.

Goons worked the polls. More than

60 persons died in election violence. 0-

Thirty computer operators at the
govemment’s own vote—counting center
walked out, charging they were being
asked to cook the numbers. And there
were reports that government agents
had been buying votes. Even before the
election, Marcos had used the power
of incumbency to promise everything
short of the moon: lower electric rates,
cheaper rice and, maybe, a water buf-
falo in‘ every pot.

On American television, however,
Marcos would concede none of this.
Priests and nuns, he said, had held back
the voters. He said the election was
tainted, but it was the opposition and
their dirty tricks that had done it. An
unholy alliance, led by the widow
Aquino with a squad of priests and
nuns, had stolen the election. Where
the vote was low, weather was to
blame, and where the weather was
good (and nuns not muscling people),
democracy ﬂourished and Marcos

W011.

The Philippines

Enough. It was not supposed to be
this way. A U.S. government, woeﬁilly
out of touch‘, had thought that Marcos
could use the power of his ofﬁce to win
re-election. There would be corruption,
sure, but it would be almost invisible
— the voting of the dead, the manipula-
tion of the count. No one, except ex-
perts who truly knew the country, had
counted on the kind‘ of show the
American people saw on television.
The experts predicted an Aquino vic-
tory. The administration thought —
later hoped —— otherwise.

But there is no “otherwise.” The
Marcos the American people saw on
just about any channel is not someone
who can be supported as an ally. As
a people, we cannot be asked to lend
financial or military aid to someone
who is either lying or so out of touch
with his own people that he has no right
to govern. The communist insurgency
in the Philippines is both growing and

serious. The U.S. bases at Clark Field
and Subic Bay are not vital, but they
are important. Still, it would be better
to abandon them than to fight the
Philippine people in the cause of
despotism. -

The Reagan administration has a
weakness for an anti-communist with
a steely glint to his eye. This is why
the United States embraced the regime
in South Africa, thinking we could

reform it with hugs and kisses. It didn't -

work there, and it did not work in the
Philippines. It was in 1981 when Vice
President George Bush, who talks the
way Liberace dresses, ' gushed over
Marcos in a toast at the presidential
palace: “We love your adherence to
democratic principles and to the
democatic process.” Since then, the
administration has come to its senses.
It is the time to write Marcos a Dear
Juan letter.

The elections in the Philippines were
called "by Marcos to placate his

American critics. He said he believed  Al
in democracy; we said we did, too. The [. _: V '

United States urged Marcos’ opposition
to unite and participate in the election-

process. As a government, we sup- '
ported free elections and hoped, in that
way, that democracy would be revived '.

and- the communist insurgency
defeated. From the unofficial vote
count, it seemed millions of Filipinos

-thought the same._ We owe them .

something.

V The United States is a world power,
and its inﬂuence in the Philippines is
enormous. Even in the post-Vietnam

era, there are some things we can do. 3 . .

One of them is reiterate who we are as
a nation and what we believe. Marcos
insults us if he thinks that our anti-
communism is a pill that enables us to
stomach anything. As quickly as possi-
ble, President Reagan ought to make
that message clear. With the elections,
we tried to change the channel. That
failed. Now it’s time to pull the plug.

"Transcendental Variations.” Michael
Lankester will conduct and Italian
violinist Salvatore Accardo will play
Beethoven’s Violin Concerto in D ma-

jor. Rochberg will speak at Heinz Hall _

on Saturday, Feb. 22 at 7 p.m., as part
of the American Composers Forum,
which is hosted by Martin Bookspan.
Saturday night’s concert ticket-holders

. will be admitted to the lecture free of

charge.

Secondly, “Sour Cream” will per-
form on Saturday, Feb. 22 at 8:30 p.m.
at Synod Hall, 125 N. Craig St. in
Oakland. The group, from Holland,
has been described as one that looks
like rockers but plays like angels. This
trio of recorder players will feature
works from Medieval to Baroque (tech-
nically dazzling canons and other “ear-
ly” music form the core of the Sour

' Cream repertoire) — but the program

will also feature “Eclipse,” a contem-
porary composition, which utilizes the
synthesizer, written by group member
Kees Boeke.

The group uses 30 or more record-
ers and a 7—foot contrabass, which they
augment with an assortment of in-
struments that include the double bass
crumhorn or viola da gambe. The in-
formal, even theatrical, atmosphere
challenges the traditional notion of the
recorder as a sweet and somewhat
romantic instrument. In fact, their
modest rebellion against this image of
the recorder gave rise to the group’s
name: “Sour” which contrasts with the
way people usually think recorders
soundz‘ sweet.

In honor of the group’s unusual
name, the Renaissance and Baroque
Society will hold a “Sour Cream
Reception” -following the concert. Its
co-sponsor is the B—L Cream Com-
pany, Pittsburgh’s only local producer
of sour cream. All the dips, desserts
and salads served will be made with
sour cream. '

Thirdly, a truly spectacular event
will occur on Sunday, Feb. 23 at the
Carnegie Music Hall at 8 p.m. when
the renowned Mendelssohn Choir per-
forms a program entitled “The Sounds
of the Soul.” The program has been
highly acclaimed; Yevgeny Yevtu-
shenko, Ukranian “poet of the peo-
ple,” will recite his poem “Babi Yar”
in Russian prior to the Mendelssohn

Choir’s performance of Shostakovich’s
Symphony No. 13 based on the text.
Barbara Cass, executive director of
the Mendelssohn Choir, describes the
13th Symphony as a “monumental
work, the demands of which are so ex-
cessive as to make. it highly unlikely
that another performance will occur
anywhere in our lifetime.” “Babi
Yar” was ﬁrst published in 1961 in the
Soviet Union. The poem itself was
something of a thorn in the side of high
government ofﬁcials, and to have Shos-
takovich use it in his symphony, bring-
ing it even more attention, was perhaps
more than they had expected.

tion awards and unanimous critical and
public acclaim. Pittsburgh Press critic
Carl Apone described the Quartet’s
Pittsburgh debut as one of “skill, preci-
sion and spontaneity that com-
municated their joy in music."

Williams, principal cellist of the
Pittsburgh Symphony, is a well—known
performer of chamber music and has

Flake. Snow. Happy dust. These
are the street terms for a narcotic
officially known as cocaine. A drug
that has become prevalent in the of-
fice, the sports arena and the
school.

Although the media and‘televi-
sion shows such as Miami Vice por-
tray cocaineas being only available
in southern Florida, cocaine is be-
ing used. abused and sold right here
in Pittsburgh.

Initially known as the rich
man’s drug,” cocaine has become
a recreational vehicle for people of
all ages and every socioeconomic
status. An operator at a national co-
caine hotline."l—800—COCAINE."
stated. “We get calls from all kinds
of people —— from all ‘walks of life.
Sometimes they are family
members who want to know what
they’re facing, what to do. What
their color is, [or what] theirjob is.
just doesn't matter.”

According to Newsweek
magazine. the typical user is a
30-year-old white male who is
earning $25,000 a year. However,
it has become obvious that white
men are not the only users of co-
caine. Newsweek reports that use
is up among women, rural residents
and young people.

The government estimates that 25
million American citizens have
tried cocaine; 5-10 million people
use the drug at least once a month.

Dr. Arnold Washton, the co-
founder of the national cocaine
hotline, states that those estimates
are too low and that another 5,000
Americans try the drug for the first
time every day. I

Five to six million are using the
drug regularly (monthly). A study
done by the National Institute on
Drug Abuse reports that 21.6
million people had tried cocaine in
1982, compared to 5.4 million in
1974. NIDA sponsored another
study done in 1982 of 10,000 high
school graduates nationwide, that
indicated that 33percent of the peo-
ple aged 22 to 26 had at least tried
the drug once.

This is a major increase com-
pared to the 10 to 15 percent that
had admitted trying it in 1976.

Evidently, the use of cocaine is
on the rise. “It’s out there and it’s
available. I would estimate that
there has been an increase of 50
percent in the use of the drug. At
this time, cocaine is being used
more extensively than heroin,” said
Paul DiMaio of the Narcotics Divi-
sion of the Pittsburgh police.

Interestingly enough, while co-
caine use has been increasing, the
price has been going down. It was
reported in Newsweek that a world
coke glut caused the price of co-
caine to go down —— to $50 per
gram in New York City. That is
less than the street price of one of
the most popular drugs, marijuana.
“Cocaine here in Pittsburgh is go-
ing for $80 to $120 a gram,
depending on the quality,” said
DiMaio.

It is estimated that between 59
and 78 tons of cocaine entered the
United States in 1983. As reported
by The Pittsburgh Press in October
of 1985, a conglomerate had
allegedly moved over 300
kilograms of cocaine from Colom-

a five—year period. The State
Department reported in February
1985 thatcoca production had risen
bygone-third over the past year
alone. Countries such as Peru, Co-
lombia, Bolivia and Ecuador have
harvested an estimated 135,000
tons of the raw coca leaf. which
L sells for $4 per pound.

Cocaine is an alkaloid derivative 5
from the coca plant, a bush which
is grown in Peru, Chile, Mexico,
Bolivia and other South American
countries. The drug could be found
in remedies such as “Agnew’s

Powders” and “Ryno’s Hay Fever
and Catarrh Remedy.” Until 1914,
several over-the-counter drugs con-
tained cocaine. It was an ingredient
in the original Coca-Cola formula,
but was removed in 1903.

In ‘ 1922, Congress prohibited
most importation of coca leaves and
designated cocaine as a narcotic.
Although normally seen as a ﬁne
white powder, “rock cocaine” and
“coca paste” are forms of the drug
that are now becoming available on
the market.

Cocaine is a stimulant; it pro-
duces a euphoric feeling. Users feel
more energy and intense awareness

if while under the inﬂuence of the
_drug. Cocaine has been touted as
an aphrodisiac, heightening the sex-

“Initially, the cocaine does act
almost like an aphrodisiac,” ex-
plained Shelly Stewart, a counselor
at the Center for Substance Abuse.

“However, there is the possibility
that after prolonged use, it may
even cause sterility,” she said.

“You feel inspired by things —
so self-conﬁdent. Cocaine gives
you a quick feeling; it doesn’t last
very long, ” said Janine, a 22-year-
old cocaine user.

“It feels great — like this great
burst of energy. It really wakes you
up! I just about bounce off the
walls. If I had the money, I’d
become an addict and do it all the
time,” agreed Lee, a 20-year-old
sophomore.

Cocaine produces this “high' ’ ‘by
crossing the blood/brain barrier and
releasing chemicals into.the central
nervous system. Low-dosage intake

5 of the drug decreases the heart rate,

while larger doses increase the
heart rate dramatically. The user’s
pupils dilate and the muscles in the
bronchial airway relax. Peak
psychological effects will occur
within 10 minutes after intake.
When cocaine is snorted, however,
the peak effect will be reached
within 10 to 20 minutes.

Cocaine is taken in several ways.
The primary method of intake is
through the nose. Freebasing is
another method, involving smoking
the drug in its “purest" form. The
drug can also be injected directly
into the veins. Freebasing and in-
jecting the drug usually produces a
better or stronger “high.” Begin-
ning users of the drug usually in-
corporate the mirror and razorblade
method. or sniffing.

Experts have suggested that most
people begin to use cocaine for
several reasons. “I ﬁnd that in 21
years in narcotics, there is -usually
involvement with other drugs, prior
to engaging in cocaine use,” ex-
plained --DiMaio. “Peer pressure
and status are also reasons for

A beginning to use the drug.”

A cocaine hotline counselor
agreed: “Usually it is peer pressure
or curiosity that gets them started.
Also, when they have done pot or
haveibeen drinking, they think, ‘I
had no problems, so I can handle

cocaine.’ After the first time, it ,

feels good and that’s how they get
hooked,” said the counselor, who
wished to remain anonymous.

“They do it once or twice; then
just on the weekends. Before you
know it, they are awfully long
weekends,” explained the
counselor.

An article in the Chronicle of
Higher Education‘ stated that the
rise in people turning to cocaine

“I had this’ big idea that
coke was something neat.
Coke had this big thing for

me. I just had to try it. ”

Julie
A Cocaine ‘ User

might be attributed to the raising of
the legal drinking age. The article
suggested that students have turned
to-more easily obtainable drugs.

“I had this big idea that coke was
something neat. Coke had this big
thing for me —-— Ijust had to try it.
My younger brother had already
tried cocaine, and if he did it, I had

‘ to,” said Lee.

“I was 15 when I first tried co-
caine. I guess it was just to satisfy
my curiosity. I was heavily into
marijuana and I had done speed,
barbiturates and amphetamines. I
think that the main reason was that

' I was rebelling, revolting. Also, it -

was,an easy way'out,” explained

Janine.

In his interview with the Chroni- ‘

cle of Higher Education, Ronald K.
Siegel — a psychopharmacologist
with UCLA — theorized that the
drug users in the ’60s' were
“searching for meaning.” The
drug culture was alienating itself
from reality. According to Siegel,
cocaine attracts people who are
more highly motivated and career-
oriented. Cocaine is to help them
shift back into society.

The same article also suggested

that students are using cocaine as

a substitute for relationships and to

boost their ﬂagging egos and"

confidence. ‘

“I used to do coke only once in
a while. It's getting more regular
every day. When I’m really done
or I just want to be in a happy
mood, I use some. Right now, I’m
doing cocaine about once a week,”
said Lee. '

“lfl didn’t have school on my
mind, I probably would do it more:
Now, I’m being’so careful because
of school. But when it’s around, I
do it. I can't say no if it’s there,”
explained Janine.

Cocaine’s upper-echelon status
has also led many people to believe

that the drug is a “clean” or

“safe” one. “That cocaine is ‘safe’
is a misnomer,” asserted Stewart.
“It is the fastest addictive drug.
When they call it a clean drug, they
aren’t referring to its healthiness or

sanitation. When people think of '

drugs, they usually think of junkies
injback alleys. Cocaine, because of
its cost and general sophisticated
aura, is considered to be pure or
safe. It’s not,” she said.
Cocaine’s long-term physical ef-
fects are numerous.The cocaine
hotline counselor lists stomach
troubles, headaches, sinus prob-
lems and respiratory ailments
among them. Cocaine use can lead

Editor ’s Note: This article is one of a

Staff Writer

Russian-born Valerie Z. Nollan. a
professor in the Slavic department.
thinks that the United States and the
Soviet Union have a lot to learn" from
each other. and she is trying to com-
municate this through her teaching.

Although Nollan will only be

_ teaching here for one year. she knows

this school well. She was a teaching
assistant at Pitt for three years before
moving on to teach at Oberlin College
for two years. The classes she has
taught at Pitt this year include both
foreign-language literature and ﬁlm, an
honors seminar in Dostoyevsky, first-
year and third—year Russian, and final-
ly, a Soviet ﬁlm course.

This past semester. Nollan was ac-
tively involved in the Slavic Club and
especially enjoyed participating in the

,,..i..... W... ......i. 
 by battling anti-Soviet sentiments

 

fall Slavic Festival produced by the
club. The festival was a combination
of singing, dancing and poetry
readings. Nollan sees the club as “a
way ofuniting the students and giving
them a sense of Russian culture.”
Nollan comes from a Russian
background herself; both parents were
born and raised in the south of Russia.

The two countries have ‘a
great deal to learn from each
other. I think chauvinism of
either type, pro—Soviet or pro-
American, is just not
broad—mindea'.

Valerie Z. Nollan
Professor of Slavic Studies

Her mother was from Kiev and her
father was from the Caucasus. Both
were forced to work in Germany at the
beginning of World War II until 1957,
when they emigrated to the United
States. Nollan, an only child, was five
when they moved here. She visited the

Soviet Union for the first time in

November. “It. was my parents’

homeland. It was very moving,” she
said.
As part of a tour, she went to

Moscow to interview a writer. After’

writing her dissertation on his early
prose, she wanted to interview him,
and was fortunate enough to talk to five
other writers. Returning to Russia in
the spring, she will continue her inter-
viewing. On her return trip. she will
visit Leningrad and Kiev in addition to
Moscow. When asked if she would

ever want to live in Russia, she '

responded. "I wouldn’t mind living
there on some sort of academic ex-
change."

When discussing anti—Soviet sen-
timents. Nollan said she felt that "the
two countries have a great deal to learn

from each other. I thinkchauvinism of

either type, pro—Soviet or pro-
American. isjust not broad—minded."
Through her interaction with students,
she has found that “a number of
students have preconceptions and

stereotypes about studying Russian.‘

They might not be inclined to learn
more about the Soviet Union and
become more informed in the area of
Soviet studies altogether." But Nollan
is very pleased with the quality of
students she has encountered at Pitt.
"I’ve been very happy here,” she said.

Terrorism: Is there any

By Kim Ingram
Staff Writer

The terrorists used little Johnny as
a sandbag, shooting through his legs at
the police outside. His panic stricken
classmates watched him after they had,
unknowingly, volunteered him for the
job. Johnny and others like him are still
recovering from the 1974 terrorist in-
cident in Maalot, Israel.

“When terrorism occurs, everyone
is concerned with how many people
died, but the survivors who must live
with the memories. and physical and
mental impairments are often forgot-
ten.” explained Mort Bregman, presi-
dent of the Western Pennsylvania
chapter of the Association for Mental
Health Affiliation with Israel, who
visited Pittsburgh in January on a
recruiting drive. AMHAI is an
organization that is interested in the

citizens of Israel who are suffering ’

mental health problems from a previous
traumatic experience.

The Western Pennsylvania chapter of
located in Pittsburgh,
organizes tours of various hospitals in
Israel for its members. The Rebecca
Sieff Hospital of northern Israel, with
the support of AMHAI and groups like
this, is providing study and rehabilita-
tion programs for victims of terrorist
attacks in Israel.

The director of the department of
psychology at the Rebecca Sieff
Hospital in Sfad, Israel, Dr. Lionel
Davidson, lectured at the Western
Psychiatric Institute and Clinic about
the psychological effects of terrorism
on the victims of the Maalot disaster
last month. ~

This incident occurred on the third
ﬂoor of a Maalot school house where
86 children, 14 to 17 years old, and
four adults were held hostage. Ter-
rorists killed 21 people and injured 16

by shooting. Some diedjumping from
a third—story window. -

In the first 1‘/2 hours after the
takeover, the hostages were tense and
afraid to move as they were kicked,
beaten, shot and threatened. The only
adult that had remained with the
children was the school nurse. She
remembered feelings of panic followed
by self-detachment before they were
rescued by Israeli soldiers.

Almost all survivors suffered some
kind of mental problem after they were
rescued, and twelve years later most of
them are still receiving psychotherapy.
Davidson said that two or three years
after the incident, 75 percent suffered
form insomnia, nightmares, headaches
and depression. Many are showing
“remarkable recovery,” according to
Davidson. _

are not involved with the politics of ter-

rorism and have little to contribute to
the government of which they live
under, are the ones who pay." said
Lauden Anise, professor of political
science and black studies at the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh. The Vienna and
Rome attacks, the Maalot incident, and
even what is happening now in
Nicaragua with the “freedom fighters”
are examples of the innocent paying for
this world political battle.
Terrorism, an explosive issue, tends
to be examined in much the same way
by the media and the American public.
The terrorist is the “bad guy” with the
machine gun ready and willing to take
an innocent life for no reason. And
while there is no justiﬁcation for brutal-
ly killing innocent people, there is a
point at which one must look at the
issue politically, rhetorically, and more
specifically, from the terrorist’s eye.
Terrorism is an issue that has recent:

ly undergone a resurgence in the
politics, newsrooms and classrooms of
the United States and around the world.
as leaders and the public grope for
answers to confront, prevent and
ameliorate the problem and aid its
victims.

Although many are concerned with
the effects of terrorism on the sur-
vivors, there are others who feel that
to rid the world of terrorism, the causes
of terrorism must be viewed_more
seriously.

“When speaking of terrorism and the
struggle against terrorism,” said
Yugoslav Foreign Prime Minister Ralf
Dizdarevic in a New York Times arti-
cie, “one must also view the causes
that lead to it, because we believe that
by the elimination of causes of ter-
rorism the phenomenon itself can be
controlled and eliminated.”

Anise explains terrorism as an issue

 

   

justification for killing?

of politics in which the needs of cer-
tain groups are overlooked. “When

revolutionaries have no police, no I

navy. or any other instrument with
which to express and protect their per-

 

i . ,. 7,‘?

sonal rights. they must resort to another '

kind of force to accomplish this. This
means terrorism as we know it."
The word “terrorism" holds a
stereotypic meaning with‘ respect to
which country one lives in. Anise
quoted King Hussein of Jordan, say-
ing that “a person‘ will see revolu-
tionaries according to where he lives.“
He gave the example of the United
States and Israel seeing the Palestine
Liberation Organization as terrorists.
“But when members of former

Palestine see Israelis living on the land‘

of Palestine, occupying this land by
military force. while Palestinians are
living in tents in another country," said
Anise. “how do they see the U.S. and
Israel? As terrorists." -
Anise said that terrorism is a way for
some revolutionaries to show that they
have needs that are not being met.
"Now the U.S. is alerted to the prob-
lem." said Anise. "they are afraid to
use airports abroad." He explained that
terrorist groups are angered into kill-
ing because their political problems are
not considered signiﬁcant enough to
solve, and this is their way of making
the world realize this significance.
But instead of gaining results from
terrorist actions, terrorist groups usual-
ly induce anger among the American
public. A Pitt student summed up the

views of many Americans: “now is '

killing a Jewish guy or a schoolhouse
full of children going to get them what
they want?" ' A

The question is — is there any
justification in killing? Whether it be
called “freedom fighting" or “ter-
rorism,” there will come a time when
there will be “a dirty little underworld
war” to avoid a nuclear crisis, accord-
ing to Anise.

to anxiety, depression. confusion,
dizziness and fainting. There have
been links to cardiovascular and
respiratory collapses.

In Dr. Stephen J. Levy’s book
"Managing The Drugs In Your
Life," he lists perforation of the
nasal septum. inflammation of the
nasal mucosa. nasal sores and
bleeding among the negative
physical effects.

Nasal problems are caused by co-
caine particles lodging in small hair
follicles in the nose. Ifthe particles
of cocaine are lodged in the sinus
cavity. headaches and constantly
running noses are to be expected.

Freebasing is considered to be
dangerous for the respiratory
system; it constricts the blood
vessels in the lungs. Injection of the
drug can lead to abscesses. sores,
overdosing, tetanus, lung abscesses
and pneumonia.

"I’m ignorant of the long—term
effects of cocaine use. I’m living
my life now. I’m not worried about
now; I’m not thinking about my
kids or the future,” said Lee.

“I know cocaine decreases the
sperm count. I’m not really sure
what it will do to me. No one
knows much about cocaine. There
is so much literature about LSD,
though.” said Janine.

“I don’t give a shit what I’m do-
ing to my body — now. When I get
pregnant, I’m going to have exten-
sivetests to make sure that I‘m not
going to have a Down’s Syndrome
baby. I’m so scared ofthat. I don‘t
think about me; I think about my
kids. I can‘t see the effects on me,
I just worry about my kids,” said
Janine.

In addition to the physical effects
of the drug, cocaine results in
psychological problems. Mood
swings, anxiety, irritability and
depression are only a few. Depres-
sion, in particular, is a resultant
facet of cocaine use.

After the short—lived “high” pro-
duced by the cocaine, the user may

suddenly “crash.” This bone-
crushing depression often creates a
craving for more cocaine in order
to relieve the depression. Thus, a
weekend habit becomes an
addiction. I

Levy lists three elements of ad-
diction: compulsion. negative con-
sequences and the loss of control.
He states that cocaine is not
physically addicting; however. it
does create a psychological
dependence. The user will ex-
perience the desire to continuous-
ly be in the altered state produced
by cocaine. The doctor suggests
that this stems from the powerful
euphoric reaction.

It is this desire that begins to
erode other parts ofthe user’s life.
It becomes necessary to have
another hit of the drug. Experts say
that this leads the user to irrational
means to gain the money for the
drug. i.e., stealing.

“All classes and races use co-
caine. and half of them can‘t afford
it. But they’ll find a way, if they
have to sell their stereo or their
body," said Janine.

College seems to be a breeding
ground for cocaine use. Students

.use the drug to help them have "a

good time.” or ‘to relax and
recuperate from the rigors of
academia. In order to support their
habits, some cocaine/drug users are
turning to selling the drugs. In this
manner, the student makes enough
money to support his habit and he
always has the drugs when he
"needs” them.

Campuses are only a microcosm
of the drug world. Cocaine and
other illicit drugs are invading the
board room, the bedroom and yes,
the dorm room. Cocaine is a source
of immediate release and a source
of income. Experts have suggested
that the production of coca has kept
some governments going. Cocaine

; has become a multi-billion-dollar

business. But who are the victims
of the spread of “snow”? The
users, the abusers and quite
possibly, future generations. .

Pittsburgh

Staff Writer _

The American people have a history
of joining together to reach out and
work for a common goal. When that
goal is hunger relief, America has
again been called to “join together as
one.” .

The American people will, in fact,
join hands as a human chain that will
stretch across the country from New
York to Los Angeles. On Sunday, May
25. at 3 p.m. EDT, at least 6 million
people will join hands from coast to
coast for the relief of hunger that ex-
ists in our nation.

Ken Kragen, president of USA for
Africa, will serve as the national
spokesman and director of Hands A-
cross America. But this time it will take
more than Kragen and several dozen
recording artists to raise money for
African relief.

Hands Across America will involve
millions of participants, as well as
thousands of volunteers working
through offices in each of the 17 states
that the human chain will pass through.
Celebrities will also participate in the
event. Four national chairmen have
been selected: Lily Tomlin, Bill Cosby,
Pete Rose and Kenny Rogers. But, to
make this event successful, many
others will be needed. Rogers himself
proclaimed that he would stand in the

loneliest part of the desert and
challenge others to stand with him.

The idea of the event led Kragen to
describe its historical context as being
“incredible enough that we might pull
it off.”

As Kragen noted in an interview with
Ampersand, “Our objectives are two— _
fold: One. to raise $50 to $100 million
for hunger and homelessness in the
United States. Two. to send a message
to politicians and anyone in and out of
government that hunger and home-
lessness are major issues that must be
addressed now.”

This spectacular fund raiser is an un-
precedented event. Never before has
such a monumental task been attempt-
ed — gathering a massive number of
human beings to take part in an event
at one time.

“It’s going to happen," said Depu—§___.,;g
ty Press Secretary Dave Fulton from“
his Los Angeles based office. “It’s
such a unique event that a lot of
momentum will pick up as this event
gets closer to happening.

“We’re stressing the fact that it’s
an American event. It’s a participatory
and active event for millions of people
to take part in,” said Fulton. The event
is symbolic of America coming to-
gether to reach a common goal.”

Participants in the event must_ buy a

chain. Fulton explained the event’s
contribution structure, six to 10 million
people will link hands, and those peo-
ple will make contributions to be a part
of it all.

"For $10 people will receive cer-
tificates oftheir participation, $25 gets
other assorted gifts, and for $35 or
more a tee shirt is given for each con-
tribution,” said Fulton.

The money donated to the Hands A-
cross America organization is planned
to help the starving and homeless
people of our own nation. It’s been
planned that 50 percent of the funds
will be directed at program support and
development. Long-range project plan-
ning will be given 40 percent of the
donated funds, while emergency relief
assistance will receive 10 percent to be
used as soon as possible.

The route of the chain link will pass
through 25 major cities. Much of the
beginning route will run through the
southwest and through the desert
region. This has been conveniently
planned to offset adverse weather con-
ditions and the mountainous terrain of
the Midwest. The route will then run
northeast so that many of the major
northern cities can be involved.

Fulton elaborated on the reasons for
the event's winding path: “The weath-
er of the southern route inﬂuenced our
plans because of the more temperate

oins hands

climate in the sun belt. Secondly, we
wanted to hit the major cities in big
media markets, and that includes Pitts-
burgh.”

Fulton added, “Not any one city was
selected for any one reason. The key
to the event is that it’s not only a na-
tional event, but, it’s really a local event
for people of every city to get involved.
Whether they’re in Pittsburgh, Dallas,
or New York, there’s going to be cit-
izens of each city getting involved to
make this event a successful one.”

The man responsible for the Pitts-
burgh area and all of Pennsylvania is
Pat FN’Piere, the director of Medium
Press for Pennsylvania. The area he
must fill is large, and he’s well aware
of the task he must face.

“We need a minimum of 425,000
people to fill the line in Pennsylvania,”
said FN’Piere, from his temporary
downtown Pittsburgh office. “We
think both the event and the purpose are
important enough foripeople to want to
be involved. There’s no precedent for
this type of event.”

More than 6 million people will
join hands together forming a human
chain across America. To be a part of
this historical event, Hands Across
America has a toll-free ‘number,
1-800-USA-9000, available to connect
interested people with the organizers
closest to their area.

a fantastic musical event. Among this
year’s highlights was a performance by
Peter Townsend and David Gilmor.

The festival began Jan. 27 with the
MIDEM prizewinners. This concert
features the seven artists who had the
best singles of the year as chosen by

a group of international journalists. The
seven artists then vote among
themselves to pick the top three songs.
Matt Bianc of Great Britain came in
first: Fine Young Cannibals was sec-
ond; and Mai-Tai from Holland was
third. Other artists featured were John
Parr. Jennifer Rush, Opus and Jeanne
Mas.

Some other events of this year’s
MIDEM included a 20th Anniversary
Prestige Gala featuring performances
by King. Simply Red. Cock Robin.
Bonnie Tyler. Peter Townsend and
David Gilmor: a special Canadian Gala
spotlighting groups like Triumph and
Honeymoon Suite; and a French Gala
featuring Jeanne Mas and Jean-Jacques
Jacques Goldberg.

In addition to the popular music.
MIDEM included a special classical
program with concerts by the Antwerp
Orchestra. the Radia Luxembourg Or-
chestra and the Monte Carlo Orchestra.
which paid tribute to the great German
conductor Kurt Fantwangler.

MIDEM ‘86 was produced by
MIDEM, Westdentscher Rundﬁnk and
Bayerischer communications networks.
A number of the galas were transmit-
ted live via Eurovision.

they had to do.” "

By John Enright
Staff Writer

The Lady Panthers’ woes continued

"last Saturday as they lost to the St.

John’s Express 58-55 in a Big East
game at Jamaica, N.Y.'
The loss was the fourth straight for

- Pitt, dropping the team’s record to 9-14

overall and 4- 10 in the conference. St.
John’s, winning its second close game
over the Lady Panthers this season,
climbed to 17-7 overall and 10-4 in
league play.

Despite the loss, head coach Kirk
Bruce was pleased with his team’s per-
formance. “They all played well. We

had a total team effort,” said Bruce. '

“The spirit was good, and everybody
hung in there and took pride in what

The game was lost at the foul line as
Pitt shot only seven free throws com-
pared to St. John’s 25 attempts. Bruce
was obviously disappointed with this
discrepancy. “If we would have shot
a comparable number of foul shots and
made a good percentage of them, we
would have won the ball game,” added
Bruce. ,

Pitt was led in scoring by center
Jenny Tyner with 15 points, while for-
ward Sally Sheerer and guard Kim
Gannis chipped in with 10 points each.

Forward Althea Yard paced the St.
John’s attack with 15 points, and guard
Jackie Smith contributed 12 points for
the Express.

Pitt hopes to get a shot at St. John’s

in the Big East Chamionships at Boston

College next week. “We feel we can

I beat them,” said Bruce. “Maybe we

will get a shot at them in the tourna-
merit.”

The Lady Panthers conclude the‘

regular season with three consecutive
home games. The most important of
the three games is tonight at 7:30 p.m.
against Connecticut at Fitzgerald Field
House. '

Women’s basketball

The Lady Panthers are currently in
a sixth-place tie with the Huskies
(12-12 overall and 4-10 in the Big
East). The‘ Lady Panthers cannot afford
to lose because the team will be risk-
ing falling into seventh place in the
league or possibly even eighth place.

Because the Big East consists of nine

By Bob Travers
Staff Writer

It was the same old song for Pitt on
Monday as the Syracuse Orangemen
hummed to a 69-92 win over the Pan-
thers. The game was a good deal closer
than the final score indicates. Indeed,
Syracuse, you might say, whistled
through the graveyard, happy to get out
of Fitzgerald with the win.’

Pitt found itself on the low side of -

the score most of the game but was on
top as late as the 7:36 mark of the sec-
ond half with the score 55-54. It was
a tight game throughout, but as has
been a hallmark of this team all season,
the Panthers came unglued during the
closing minutes of the contest and gave
the game away.

“There’s nothing you can put your
finger on,” Pitt head coach Roy Chip-
man said of the defeat. “It was a
number of things.”

The loss drops Pitt to 5-7 in Big East
with four league games remaining. The
overall Panther mark stands at 14-9.
Despite such an underwhelming
record, some Pitt players, and Chip-
man, are not ruling out a Panther in-
vitation to the NCAA’s post-season
party.

“I think we’re still in the running for
a bid,” said Demetreus Gore, who had
22 points against Syracuse. “We went
last year with only 17 wins, and we
have 14 now with four games left. I
definitely think we can win three, if not
all four, of those games.”

Chipman echoed Gore’s , remarks.
“We’ve got a tough task ahead of us.
We’re not out of it [contention for an
NCAA bid], but I said before, we’ve
got to win at least 17 games. Coming
close against good teams like Syracuse
and St. John’s doesn’t matter,” said
Chipman.

Midway through the second half,
with the score 49-48 in Pitt’s favor,
Darryl Shepherd stepped to the free-
throw line for two shots. He missed the
first and the second. Less than a rrunute
laster Curtis Aiken took a duo of free
throws and was good on only one. To
make matters worse, with the score
54-52 Syracuse, Jerome Lane hit just
one of two shots from the line.

schools, the eighth— and ninth-place
finishers have to square off in a
preliminary game to the tournament.
The winner of this dreaded battle of the
Big East doormats has to play the
regular-season Big East Champ the
next day. This is definitely a situation

_the Lady Panthers want to avoid. A win

tonight would assure them of no lower
than a seventh-place finish.

Connecticut is coming off an 80-57
loss to current Big East leader Prov-
idence. The Huskies are led by 6-2
senior center Peggy Walsh. Walsh is
currently third in the league in scoring
at 17.5 points per game and first in re-
bounding at 12.2 rebounds per contest.
Connecticut’s other star player is guard
Tammi Sweet. Sweet, a 5-9 junior,
averages 13.1 points per game and 4.2
assists per game.

all short  again

It was during that crucial stretch of
the second half, when Pitt hit a mere
two of six from the line, that the Pan-
thers effectively lost the game.

The Panthers were good a dismal
four times in their foul shots. Free
throws cost Pitt dearly, and Chipman
could find no explanations why.

“I don’t understand that,” the Pan-
ther boss said of his team’s troubles
from the line. “I don’t know what to
attribute it to. I can’t say they weren’t
out there not concentrating. I "don’t

know what it was. But on our own .

floor, it's inexcusable.”

There were other contributors to the
Panther defeat. Charles Smith had four
fouls with 12 minutes left and watched
from the bench as Syracuse rallied
around “The Pearl” and took the game
away from Pitt. 9

“When Charles came back in after
his fourth, he couldn’t be as aggressive

as he normally is,” Gore said. “And

I think that hurt us.” .

It was not the best of nights for the
talented Smith who finished with just
nine_points and eight rebounds. What

really hurt the Panthers about those '8

stats is that eight of those points came
in the first half. Syracuse was able to
effectively eliminate Pitt’s greatest
scoring threat during the second half.
And Chipman seemed none too pleased
with Smith’s play.

‘ ‘Charles wasn’t real active,’ ‘Chip-
man commented. “He ,did a lot of

standing around, and he eally wasn’t '”

coming to the basketbal .” ' Q

In fairness to Smith, he did have 6-9 8 ‘

Wendell Alexis or 6-10 Rony Seikaly
guarding him like the bobbies watching

Buckingham Palace. With Smith taken“

out of the game, Pitt became a much
weaker team offensively.

Enter Dwayne “The Pearl” Wash-
ington and the boys. “The Pearl” spar-
kled Monday night, leading all scorers _

with 23 points and dishing out five
assists. Pitt’s guards were no match for
the illustrious Syracuse backcourt of
Washington and Rafael Addison. 0‘

“Washington has done the job for us

in the last ﬁve games,” Syracuse coach‘

Jim Boheim said. “A lot of times peo-
ple expect only miracles from him, and
occasionally he delivers, but tonight he
just played-a good, solid game.”

JOHN

PUCKEIT

By Patrick Good‘
Staff Writer

For every athlete there comes a time
when goodbyes must be said to the
sport he loves. When that athlete is a
collegiate wrestler, his time comes
much sooner. Wrestlers don’t have a
professional career to look forward to.
other than a career in the ﬁeld of study
they pursued for four or ﬁve years at
their respective colleges.

Tonight at Shaler High School, the
Nellis brothers, Kyle and Ken, will be
on opposing teams. Kyle and his
University of Pittsburgh teammates
will host Ken and Clarion University
in ﬁerce Eastern Wrestling League
competition.

Ironically, the two brothers will end
their collegiate careers, somewhat ap-
propriately, at the school where they
first established their reputations.

Kyle, a 134-pound starter for four
seasons, is a two-time state ﬁnalist, and
he won the title once to cap his senior
season in 1982. Brother Ken, now in
his fifth year at Clarion, is the Golden
Eagles’ starting 150-pounder and a
former two-time state champion for
Bob Siar’s Shaler Titans. Both wres-
tling brothers have won MVP honors
at the prestigious Pittsburgh Press
Wrestling Classic held in Pittsburgh
each year.

The two.Nellises are co—captains of
their respective teams. Kyle is Shaler’s
winningest wrestler with 127 wins, and
he is also Pitt’s all-time winningest
wrestler, having won 87 matches and
still counting. Ken is only the sixth
Clarion wrestler in history to amass
100 career wins, a feat he also accom-
plished while at Shaler.

Shaler’s coach Siar is quite proudof
his former pupils. “I have expected
them to be as successful as they’ve
been," said Siar. “I‘m not surprised
at all. They both fall into the class of
outstanding people, and they both work
so very hard. ' _

“I’ve been fortunate to have both
outstanding kids. It will be tremendous

for the two kids to come back to Shaler '

for a homecoming.”
The special homecoming for both

 

  
 

Nellis brothers wouldn’t have been
possible had Ken finished his eligibili-
ty last year. Instead. he too is coming
home to relive past memories and to
act out another, a memory both can
cherish for a lifetime.

j‘It will be fun for me now. The
competition is a lot tighter, and I’m not
sure if the year off has helped or hurt
me. People will expect a lot, but at this
level you never know what will hap-
pen.”

On the other side stands Kyle, the
youngest child of Robert and Mary
Agnes Nellis. The family includes six
boys and one girl. “I’m looking for-
ward to it,” said a smiling Kyle. “It’s
not only good for area wrestling in
general. but it will be kind of special.

“It will be an enjoyable evening for
both of us, I’m sure. It will bring back
many memories of the past.”

Pitt head coach Rande Stottlemyer,
a long-time friend of the Nellis fami-
ly, helped plan the event, partly for

 

 

Kyles benefit. "Ken's participation
wasn‘t planned. but it has rather ﬁtting-
ly worked out that way." he said.
“I'm excited for both of them." said
Stottlemyer. “it’s just great for it to
happen by accident for Ken, but it was
set up for Kyle. I‘m sure they both will
feel a little pressure going back there.”
The event’s central attraction is the
Nellis reunion at their alma mater. Kyle
has been an outstanding student, car-
rying a better than 3.1 grade point
average in Pitt’s highly competitive
electrical engineering program. The
soft-spoken Nellis is also a big truster

' in God and ﬁnds great spiritual strength

from his prayers.

“I can’t sayenough about Kyle,”
Stottlemyer is quick to say. “The kid
is a tremendous individual who earns
everything he gets. He’s done nearly
everything at Pitt but qualify for na-
tionals.”

. Nellis himself is ready to meet that
challenge. From a good talk at a Chris-

tt’s Kyle Nellis wll welcome l1lS brother  ack th  area tonight 

  

77¢-4 .-.r.;

tian Athlete Fellowship meeting. Nellis
was inspired by a quote he heard. He
follows the saying to reach his goals.
especially now as he sets his sights on
going to nationals to be an All-
America: “No reserves. no regrets. no
retreats."

"I like to live by that quote.“ said
Kyle. “I want to look back and be hap-
py with what I did. Otherwise, I’ll be
a frustrated old man.”

Ken, a three—time NCAA qualifier,
is looking to graduation in May. He’ll
receive his business management
degree five years after leaving Shaler.
He now returns along with his brother
for a last hurrah.

“I think it’s a nice way for things to
work out the way they have," Ken
said. “It‘s always difficult for me to
watch Kyle wrestle. This will be a u-
nique event, and I’m sure it will be
fun.”

Fun at least for the one who wins the

bragging rights.

Big East’s elite gatherat Trees
for conference championships

By Gary Geller
Staff Writer

A feeling of excitement is permeating
the air at Trees Hall as the University
of Pittsburgh women’s. swim team
gears up for Championship competi-
tion. The season—ending Big East
Championship is taking place at 11
am.‘ and 7 p.m. on Feb. 19-22, at
Trees Hall pool.

Preparation for this end—of—the—
season meet has been changed to let the
swimmers practice at full energy yet
also to allow for a break from the rigors
of a long swimming schedule.

“We’ve been resting a little more
and haven’t had morning workouts,”
said junior swimmer‘ Tracy Pfister.

“We’re looking to build power and
strength. ‘We reduced morning

David Belowich. “We’ve changed the
training pattern completely. We’re
really sharpening up the fine points of
races. We’re trying to train at the ‘wall’
level by mimicking the conditions of
races.”

 

<51?

Belowich summed up his feelings
about the readiness and exuberance of
his current squad during their short
break from regular season action.
“Right now, it’s a matter of getting in,
getting out and getting ready to go
fast-” _

Pitt’s competition in the past to cap-
ture the Big East Championship will be
presented by various individuals from
the other Big East teams. During the
regular season, Pitt has defeated Big
East foes Syracuse and Villanova hand-

ily. Pitt hopes to beat all of their op-
ponents and in the process, attain a high
level of competition.

“We want our level of competition
to rise to new heights,” said Belowich.
“We want to reach within ourselves to
go beyond what we’ve accomplished.”

All of the other squads will be gun-

ﬁning to dethrone Pitt from its perch

among college’s premier swim teams.
One team which will pose no threat
to the Panthers is Seton Hall. “Seton
Hall is so small; typically, they’re not
really any competition whatsoever.
They only have 5 or 6 people,” said
Belowich. A
A Syracuse swimmer to look out for

is freshman Karen Milborn, a good _

sprinter in the freestyle and butterﬂy
competitions.
' ‘ ‘She’s been on the Great Britain na-

' tional team a few times. She’ll be the

first seed in the 100-ﬂy ahead of Susan
Hickman and third or fourth in the
100-freestyle,” commented Belowich.

Another freshman, Karen Lapat,
who’s from Philadelphia, is a “pretty
good” diver, according to Belowich.
Sophomore Patty McKenna is a good
backstroker and sprint ﬂyer. Heidi
Wormbrand, a junior, will give Pitt
some competition in ‘the sprints. Two
years ago, she set theirecord in the
200-yard butterﬂy. -

Seniors Lynn Haggerty and Sallie
Cinco are solid performers in the
freestyle and butterﬂy strokes
respectively.

“We’ve had a very good competi-
tion over the last four years. I’ve got-

weekend at Trees Pool. ‘ '

ten to know these two kids as com-
petitors. They’re really classy kids, and
both are neat kids to watch,” said
Belowich. A
“In general, Boston College is a
young team, but a good team. With 22
swimmers listed on the entry, they are
one of the largest teams in terms of
numbers,” continued Belowich.
Freshman Mary Bebau “looks to be
among the top ﬁve seeds in the mile
and 500,” according to Belowich.
Also, fellow freshman Kim Ryan will
be placed among the top swimmers.
“She’ll be seeded real high in the
mile. The further she goes, the better
she gets,” stated Belowich.
Sophomores Kim Hanson and Suzy
Sullivan will compete in the sprints.
Perhaps the best match-up of the
competition will be between Tara
McKenna, a two time 100—yard breast
stroke champion in the Big East and

Pitt junior Jodi O’Neil. “She and Jodi ‘ ’

have gone head to head the past cou-
ple of years. It’s one of the best match-
ups the Big Easthas,” said Belowich.
“Connecticut doesn’t have too much
this year from the looks of things. They
have a lot of freshman. They have a lot
of people that we don't know.”

Belowich thinks Dana Redman is the
Huskies topswimmer in the 100- and
200-yard breast stroke. “She’s perhaps
their best swimmer. She's a good com-
petitor. ”

“Georgetown is really coming on.
They’re considerably improved,” con-

tinued Belowich, “they have a large
entry.”

Sophomore Elke Giebeler will be a
good performer in the distance races.
“She’ll be among the top eight in the
mile,” said Belowich.

“Villanova- has people that will
challenge us,” quipped Belowich.

-Freshman Mindy Wormbrand, the
sister of Syracuse’s Heidi Wormbrand,
is a good 200-yard butterﬂyer.

‘ ‘She’ll probably be seeded in the top
three in the 200-yard butterﬂy, top
eight in the 100-ﬂy, and seeded well
in the 200 and 400 IM,” said
Belowich.

Another freshman, Sue Schroeder,
who Pitttried to recruit, is a “good
swimmer,” said Belowich. ‘She will be
among the top eight in the 100- and
200-yard breast stroke. Sophomores
Meg Fitzgerald and Diane Dieboes are
solid performers in the backstroke and
distance events respectively.

‘ ‘Senior Lori Bukati is one of the bet-
ter divers outside of Pitt. She will
deﬁnitely be in the top eight," noted

. Belowich. Villanova also has distance

freestyler Cindy Cerami and senior
captain Carolyn Ryan, a sprinter.
The Panther’s attitude going into this
championship is one of enthusiasm.
“It’s gonna be a better competition than
ever_ before," said Belowich. “I an-

ticipate a lot of fast swimming. They’re '

excited. They’re feeling really good.
They want to swim fast.” .

The Pit‘. ;\Lcws_ Fcbruar_\i 19. 1986

Panthers gear up for fourth
consecutive Big East title

By Teresa Varley
For The Pitt News

A real test of how good a team is can
be reﬂected in how badly an opponent
wants to beat them. The better you are,
the more the other team wants to win.
This is the case of Pitt men’s swim
team.

The Panthers are three-time Big East
champions and will start to work on
number four as Pitt hosts the con-
ference championships beginning today
at Trees Pool.

The other teams in the conference are
tired of taking a back seat to the Pan-
thers and are upset-minded.

“Being the team others are shooting
at has its good points and bad,” said
head coach Fred Lewis. “I like the idea
of having them all want to be us. It's
nice. It motivates us to stay on top. It
gives them something extra to work
for. It gives them another goal and ex-
tra motivation.”

The toughest competition the Pan-
thers will face comes from Villanova
and Syracuse. Last year, the Panthers
won‘ the meet with 693 points, while
Villanova finished in a close second
with 604 points. At Villanova earlier
this season, the Panthers lost 64-49.
The Panthers do not plan on losing
twice to the Wildcats, though.

“Having lost to them gives us more
incentive to win,” said junior Rick
James, who will be a strong contender
in both the backstroke and individual
medley. “We’ve never lost to them
before that. But, this time we’re in our
own pool and we know it and I think
that will give us an advantage.”

Syracuse will also provide some
tough competition for the Panthers.
Scott Henry. a senior for the Orang-
emen, is the defending 100- and
200-yard breast stroke champ. He
defeated Donald Martin of Pitt, but
now it’s Martin’s turn to get back on
top.
said. “It will be a good race in the 100,
but I think I can win the 200.”

While Henry is sure to give Martin
a run for his money, according to
Lewis, the smart money is on Martin.

Men’s swimming

“I won’t bet against Donny,” Lewis
said. “This is his last meet at home.
He does not want to come in second.
He has a goal time and he is going to
shoot for that.”

One of the keys to a Panthers’ vic-
tory will be a strong performance from
the divers. In all of Pitt’s meets, they
have dominated opponents and are ex-
pected to do so once again.

“The divers will have to do their
normal outstanding job,” Lewis said.
“All five of them will have to come
together and score. That is where we
have most of our depth. We have five
individuals who are going to the ﬁnals
in each event. It will be hard to knock
them of .”

The divers will be led by senior Todd
Mulzet, last year’s conference Most
Outstanding Diver and one-meter
champ, and junior Jack Shuten, last
year’s three-meter champ. Those two,
along with senior Mike McCalley,

sophomore Chris Blair and freshman
Vernon Yenick. should be the top five
finishers in both events. While the
others have experience in big meets.
this will be Yenick‘s first test, and one
he is likely to pass.

“I’m pretty nervous,” Yenick ad-
mitted. “I’ve had a good season and
I think I’ll do well. I‘m not overconfi—
dent, though. I'would like to finish in
the top five. I wouldn’t mind if
somebody from our team beat me, but
I don’t want to lose to someone from
another team.”

The key to the team’s overall success
will be strong performances all around.
Lewis feels that all of the swimmers
who are in the preliminaries need to
swim in the finals for the team to win.

“Everybody has to score,” Lewis
said. “We need a lot of first places.
The guys who are swimming off events
really need to come through for us.”

One of the off events is the 400-yard
individual medley, which is not one of
the events in dual meets. Franks
Williams, last year’s champ in it, will
be looking to repeat. The Panthers will
also need strong performances in the
individual medley from distance free-
style specialists Geoff Rife and Mar-
tin Durkin.

“We are going to have to do what-
ever it takes to get first place,” Lewis
said. “We want to win.”

 

Pitt wrestlers host Clarion

By Patrick Good
Staff Writer

To this point, it has certainly been
a very good year for the Pitt wrestling
team — maybe better than many
thought was possible. Yet, tonight the
tenacious Panthers will face perhaps
their toughest challenge of this long and
grueling season. The 7-2-2 Panthers
will meet No. 3 ranked Clarion Univer-
sity (l6—0—l this season) in fierce EWL
competition before a packed house at
the Shaler High School gymnasium.

The Panthers rolled through their
early schedule producing an impressive

7-0-2 record. In the last two weeks,
however, the Panthers have dropped
matches to No. 4 Penn State and No.
9 Bloomsburg. by the combined score
of 64-17.

Despite the lopsided results from
Pitt's last two match defeats, the
meeting with Clarion places the Pan-
thers in a new light. The Panthers
traveled to compete against the two
wrestling powers. This time the Pan-
thers will be closer to home, and each
individual match puts Pitt on a more
even level with Clarion. Both schools‘
head coaches are well aware of this
situation.

Bob Bubb, 42—l6—l as Clarion coach
against EWL opponents, wants to
finish the season undefeated but knows
it will be hard to beat the underrated
Pitt team.

“I think they’re one of the tougher
teams we’ll wrestle,” said Bubb.
“They have decent balance and the key
to this match will be the matchups. It
will be our strengths going against their
strengths.’ ’

Pitt’s coach Rande Stottlemyer is
more concerned about Clarion’s
momentum as they roll into Shaler
riding a near—perfect season.

“They have the momentum coming

in,” proclaims Stottlemyer. “The first
three matches are vital to our success.
If we can stop their momentum. then
we’ve got as much a chance of beating
them as they have."
" Following the first three matchups.
the match of the night may just be at
142 pounds between Pitt freshman Pat
Santoro. 24-4 this year. and Clarion’s
Mike Cole. 30-4. Both have beaten the
other once this season, but Santoro has
recently jumped over Cole in the na-
tional rankings to ﬁfth overall. Stottle-
myer again regards this as another
match that Pitt will desperately need if
they’re to upset Clarion's bid at an
unbeaten season.

“Their ace in the hole is Mike Cole
and he’s been the stopper for -them this
season, but our stopper has been Pat.
You know who my money is on, ” said
Stottlemyer.

Most of the premateh money will be
riding on the coattails of an impressive
Clarion team. The Golden Eagles enter
the match with six starters with 20
match wins and four wrestlers ranked
in the top 10 at their weight. To offset
the strength of the Clarion lineup, Stot-
tlemyer must call upon his team to
come up with their best effort.

“I just want them to pour their hearts
out,” Stottlemyer said. “They’re go-
ing against the No. 3 team and it won’t
be easy. If our guys wrestle like they’re
capable, we’ll be in the match with
them.”

Coach Bubb knows that his team
must be ready for a tough challenge.
come match time.

“Our guys are anxious to wrestle the
match. Our kids would like to shoot for
the unbeaten record. It’s certainly a
worthy accomplishment for them. but
it won’t be easy.

“They [Pitt] have everything to gain
and nothing to lose. We have a lot of
respect for them," said Bubb.

The Pitt News, February 19, 1986

BeanoCook:Heknowsfootball

By Jim Urban
Sports Editor

How many people can say they
predicted Oklahoma would be the Na-
tional Champions for the l985—86 foot-
ball season? How many people can say
they predicted Penn State would be
playing for the National Championship
on New Year’s Day? One person can
— his name is Carrol H. “Beano”
Cook.

Cook, a 1954 graduate of Pitt, is a
color analyst for ABC Sports’ coverage
of NCAA football. Cook made his pro-
nouncement that Oklahoma would go
all the way in SPORT Magazine’s an-
nual college football preview. During
a Saturday afternoon telecast in
September, he predicted that Penn State
would play for the National Champion-
ship. Oklahoma defeated Penn State in
the Orange Bowl and fulfilled Cook’s
prophecy. ' _ -

“That doesn’t make up for picking
Tennessee and Arizona State the two

’ years before that,” laughs Cook, who

is currently waiting to see if he will
return to ABC next fall for a ﬁfth year.

Cook’s job is insecure because ABC
was recently bought by Capital Cities
and a new sports director, Dennis
Swanson, was hired. Cook is not sure
what he will be doing next fall.

“I‘m waiting to see if I’m going to
be rehired,” Cook said. “They’ve had
a big shakeup. I should know within
two weeks whether they are going to
hire me or not.”

Cook was the Sports Information
Director at Pitt in the early 60’s, but

he has had several different employers
since then, including CBS and the Civic
Arena. He would like to remain where
he is right now, but will have no regrets
if he isn’t hired back.

“I’ve had four years of it," Cook

“lfl ran Pitt, there would
be certain kids who would not
have gotten back in school for
some of the things they have
done. I can say the same for
a lot of schools across the
country. ”

— Beano Cook

said. “The biggest sin you can have is
not trying. I would hate to look-back
and wonder if I could have done it.”
As ABC’s color analyst, Cook has
been able to keep an eye on college
football, especially the Pitt football pro-
gram. The Panthers suffered through
their second consecutive mediocre
season in 1985, and head coach Foge
Fazio was fired at the end of the
season. I

“I think what has happened the last
few years in Pitt football is that there
has been a lack of discipline off the
field,” Cook said. “I think that has
been a major problem. You have to
have that discipline off the field.”

Several Pitt players had- charges
brought against them last year after

altercations with fellow students.
Quarterback Dante Wiley, who has
since transferred to Nebraska, was
ordered to pay restitution after he
allegedly beat up a student in Lothrop
Hall, and running back Craig Heyward
was forced to sit out the 1985 season
for allegedly striking another student
with a crutch.

“There were just too many in-
cidents,” Cook said. “You cannot
have that type of thing, and you have
to stress it with the athletes. Coaches
all across the country are going through
the same thing.”

Evidently, new Pitt head coach Mike
Gottfried has realized this. He currently
has two players, receivers Dexter
Hairston and Tony Williams, suspend-
ed from the team pending the outcome
of legal action taken against both

players by Pitt students. Hairston and '
Williams were involved in separate in- '

cidents on campus.

“If I ran Pitt,” Cook said, “there
would be certain kids who would not
have gotten back in school for some of
the things they have done. I can say the

same for a lot of schools across the ~

country.”

Cook has been impressed with Gott-
fried’s handling of the program since
he took over in mid—December.

-“I expect the program to turn
around,” Cook said. “They just had
a couple of bad years, that’s all.”

Cook should know. He has followed
college football for close to four
decades. He has seen it all.

“The game has changed,” Cook
said. “It is not as fun as it used to be.”

Shuten stars on springboard

By Teresa Varley
For The Pitt News

If you were to venture into Trees
Pool at the University of Pittsburgh
campus on a winter afternoon, there is
one thing you would notice immediate-
ly — the temperature. The warm attire,
which seemed a must minutes before
when you slopped through the snowy
streets. could easily be replaced with
the latest in Hawaiian fashions as the
poolside temperature is quite balmy.

But, after a few minutes of taking in
the feeling of being in paradise, or at
least a sauna bath, your attention would
most likely focus on an area of the pool
where laughter and enjoyment is a must
for all practice sessions.

It’s where some of the top divers in
the East show their stuff daily while
having fun doing 50.

Jack Shuten, a junior from
Rochester, N.Y., is one of those top
divers who enjoys mixing business with
pleasure at Pitt practice.

“The best thing you can do is joke
around when you are not on the
board." Shuten said with a smile. "If
you’re with other teammates and
you’re having fun, you tend to be more
relaxed. The more relaxed you are, the
better you are going to dive. As soon
as you start getting uptight and tense.
that‘s when the problems start."

.While some teams might look upon
a structured. well-organized practice as
being the key to the team's success, the
Panthers’ divers prefer the loose at-
mosphere that Coach Julian Krug pro-
vides. Daily practices are based on
what each diver wants to do that day.
There are no requirements. All Krug
asks of his divers is that they go out
there and do their best.

"I look at all the other teams and
how they have scheduled workouts and»
they all have to be there and don‘t have
much freedom." Shuten commented.
“Then I look at our team and notice
that our whole team is self-motivated.
11' you have too much homework to do
and you can't make it to practice. tine.
no one asks. It motivates everyone that
much more. and since we have so many
good._divers on our team. were just

forced to dive beyond what we normal-
ly would. When we’re at practice,
were there because we love the sport,
not because somebody told us we had
to be there."

Shuten is a good example of Krug’s
practice methods being successful.
Shuten won the three—meter diving
event at last year’s Big East Champion-
ships, competed on the one-meter
board at the NCAA Championships
and three-meter at senior outdoor na-
tionals. He is hoping to once again be
a winner this year at the Big East,
which will be held Feb. 19-22 at Pitt’s
Trees Pool. He would also like to im-
prove on his finish at last year’s
NCAAs.

“This year I would like to qualify for
NCAAS on both boards,” said Shuten.
his bright blue eyes aglow thinking of
the possibilities. “I don’t know what
my chances are, but I would like to
finish my college career as a two-time
All-America. ”

Krug, who has seen Shuten develop

both physically and mentally since he
has been at Pitt, believes in his diver’s
capabilities. ‘

"All indications are that Jack will
qualify for NCAAs and it is likely he
will do so in both events,” Krug said.
"He has a real shot at becoming an All-
America. He is more able to handle the
pressure now. You have to be able to
stand in a tough spot and do good
dives. It takes a good mind."

Yes, indeed. it does take a good mind
to be a diver. You have to have the
ability to block things out of your mind
when you are on the boards. According
to Shuten, any distractions in your
mind can result in your dive being
unsuccessful.

"This sport is so mind.-oriented."
Shuten said. who happens to be a
psychology major. "Half of diving is
how you deal with your mind. In the
beginning of the season. I lost a lot of
confidence in myself. It is starting to
come together right now. I have more
confidence in myself. When you stand
on the board there's a million things in
your mind. and the dominant thing in
my forehead was that I might miss the
dive. Now it is in the back'of my head

‘and I don't think about it as much."

, Shuten. who is a free-spirited person.

got serious about his diving after his
high school dropped its gymnastics
program. Prior to that. diving was
something that he did for fun since
about seventh grade. He always had an
interest in diving and said, “If you
would take me to a swimming pool, I
would always play on the diving
board.” He sat out his junior year after
a diving accident which required 22
stitches in his leg after he hit it on the
board.

When the time came to choose a col-
Iege, Shuten knew he wanted to go to

. a Division I school because of the

strong competition it offers. He went-
to the University of North Carolina-
Wilmington for a year, but transferred
to Pitt to see how far he could take his
diving.

“One of the main reasons I came to
Pitt was Julian,” Shuten said. “He is
one of the best coaches in the nation.

He was able to take me from absolute- '

Iy nothing to the NCAAs. Julian has
not only improved my diving, but has
made me grow up.“

There are a lot of adjustments that

need to be made when you go away to ‘

college and Shuten was no exception
to these. He grew up in a small suburb
in Rochester and then enjoyed life on
the beach when he was at North
Carolina. Now, living in Pittsburgh. he
has to deal with the big city. But.
regardless of the differences, the na-
tion‘s’“Most Liveable City” has real-
Iy grown on him.

“I enjoy Pittsburgh immensely,”
Shuten said. “I love living in the city.
You can be an individual. You can be
yourself and be accepted for who you
are. There are so many opportunities
here and so much to do in your free
time. I plan on staying here a couple
of years after school is over and look-
ing for a job.“

Another thing Shuten enjoys about

the city are the people. especially his ‘

teammates. They are all friends and get
along quite ,well. They are constantly
pushing each other to become better
and ultimately. they all are improving.
All it takes is watching them practice
to see how good they are. Sure. there’s
a lot of laughter and fun, but an awful’
lot of good dives are performed in be-

As I seeit

The Pitt News, February 19, 1986

By Jim Brueckner

Pitt should bring back boxing

I love all sports. Well,.almost all
of them. But there are two sports which
stand out in particular: baseball and
boxing. As you can imagine, I feel a
sudden urge around this time of year.
In fact, Ijust came from downstairs,
where I ordered my Fan Flex Pirate
coupon book. Just before typing this ar-
ticle, I picked out the games that I
would like to attend.

I’m planning on attending 18 games
this season. ‘

We, the baseball fans of Pittsburgh,
are able to attend major league baseball
on a regular basis. But the same can-
not be said of us, the boxing fans of
Pittsburgh. Why not?

I’m not asking for Hagler-Mugabi or
Holmes-Spinks, but how about up—and-
coming ﬁghters?

This city is dominated by rugged
working class people who like rough
sports. This city’s legendary support of
the Steelers is proof of that.

Bringing boxing back to Pittsburgh
would not be a complete gamble. Box-
ing was at one time very popular in the
Steel Town. It has a history here. In
fact, a part of that history involves the
University of Pittsburgh. _

Boxing came to Pitt in 1930, under
athletic director Don Harrison. He ap-
pointed Joe Orsini as coach, and the

team began training at Trees Gym. The 0

young boxers then moved to a room in-
side Gate 3 at Pitt Stadium.

At that time, the Pitt basketball team

layed at the Pitt Pavilion, a small gym

located underneath the seats at Pitt
Stadium. The boxing team usually
fought on the same nights as basketball
teams.

The central ﬁgure of the brief history
of Pitt boxing was Jack Schricker.
Schricker, who bore a fair resemblance
to Jack Dempsey, was the ace freshman
in 1930 and the head coach of the team
when it was scrubbed in 1939.

Schricker coached many ﬁne ﬁghters
during his term and was himself a two-
time l55—pound Eastern champion.

When the announcement came years
later that the program was being
dropped, it came as a surprise to many.
especially Schricker.

The university released a statement
saying that action was taken due to
“lack of ' interest.” Schricker never
bought it. He contended that it was due
to a selected part of society which felt
that too many injuries occurred in
boxing.

Schricker added that the injuries that
did occur came as a result of improper
training, not the sport itself. Hmm.
Sounds familiar, doesn’t it?

There was certainly no problem with
the lack of success.

In the last year of the program, Pitt
won its first Eastern Conference title
at the championships held at Morgan-
town, W. Va. Following that win, Pitt
entered the national championships for

the first time in Charlottesville, Va. -

Pitt boxing was on the rise when the
ax came down. It looked to get even
better. According to Schricker, “We

had four freshmen boxers who were
better in their weight class than the var-
sity regulars.”

On the professional scene, Pittsburgh
was the site of many major fights, in-
cluding its share of world title bouts.
Western Pennsylvania was fast becom-
ing an area of hot prospects. Between
July 13, 1939 and Nov.. 18, 1941, ﬁve
area boxers won world championships.
They were: Sammy Angott, Fritzie
Zivic, Billy Soose, Jackie Wilson and
one of the greatest light weights of all
time, Billy Conn.

The problem with bringing boxing
back to Pittsburgh is that too many peo-
ple will expect million—dollar gates
immediately.

Be patient, let’s start slow. How
about Pitt taking another crack at var-
sity boxing? If we can build a solid
amateur program in Pittsburgh, maybe
the pros won’t be far behind. Once Pitt
turns out a few popular amateurs, the
public would be eager to see them con-
tinue a professional career here in
Pittsburgh.

Boxing at Pitt worked once before:
there is no reason why it can’t work
again. There are no guarantees, but
then again, where would we be if
mankind had never taken any chances.
What if Branch Rickey never took a
chance on a kid named Robinson?

Let’s take a chance. Let’s turn back
the clock to the time of'Jack Schricker
and have Pitt pick up where it left off
with its boxing program.

Runners gear up for Big East . ..

By Jim Urban
Sports Editor

When one mentions the Big East
Conference, the first thing that comes
to mind is “a strong, competitive
basketball conference.” Well, no one
can argue with that statement, but that
axiom holds true for about six other Big
East Conference sports — baseball,
soccer, volleyball, swimming, tennis
and the one referred to here -— track.

“It is a lot like basketball,” Pitt track
coach John Vasvary said. “There are
a lot of good teams and a lot of good
athletes.‘ Anything can happen — you
just hope the things that happen are
good for you.”

Vasvary is hoping for a lot of good
things this weekend when he takes his
squad to Syracuse University for the
Big East Championships at the Carrier
Dome. The Panthers are a young team,
dominated by freshman and
sophomores, but they have not gone
unnoticed this season.

Sophomore Lee McRae has been
most impressive. A pure thoroughbred,
McRae holds the second fastest
55-meter time in the world this year.
An All-America both indoors and out-
doors last year, he has already qualiﬁed
for the NCAA Championships this
year. He can add another award to the
trophy case this weekend.

“Lee would definitely be a
favorite,” Vasvary said, “both in the
55-meter dash and in the 300—meter.”

McRae finished third in the 55-meter
at the prestigious Millrose Games at
‘Madison Square Garden last Friday
night. He then went to Chicago and
won the same race at the Bally Invita-
tional on Saturday. He is not alone,
however.

The other ace that Vasvary is holding
is his two-mile relay team. It also took
first at the Bally Invitational with a time
of 7:31.73. Comprised of junior Bob
Weiner, sophomore Joe Daniels, and
freshmen Thomas Boggan and David
Moore, the two-mile team has come
together recently, after an ankle injury
suffered by junior Tim Manes forced
Vasvary to insert Boggan.

Unfortunately, Manes is not the only
injured Panther. Hurdler Jason Harris
and sprinter George Iffil are both
hampered by pulled hamstrings, and
sprinter Rodney Giles is out with a
separated shoulder.

“They are nowhere near where we
would like them to be,” Vasvary said,
“not even near full strength.”

It may not be all that bad, however.
From prior experience, Vasvary knows
there -may be some surprises this
weekend. .

‘ ‘Sometimes in the past when things
like this [have] happened, I have seen
a team rally together and give a strong

effort,” Vasvary said. “We feel like
we can be in the ﬁght.”

The same goes for the Pitt women’s
track team. Despite having a young
team, coach Steve Lewis is a confident
individual.

“We are only taking three seniors
and one sophomore to the Big East
Championships,” Lewis said. “The
rest of the squad will be made up of
freshmen.”

The Lady Panther team is — so to
speak — the new kid on the block as

far as women’s track is concerned. The ‘

program has dwindled in previous
years under head coach Elbert Ken-
nedy, but Lewis has begun rebuilding.

“This is a first-team effort,” pro-
claimed Lewis. “We are taking the
biggest, strongest, most competitive
team we have ever taken to the Big East
Championship. This team is responsi-
ble for setting 17 new school records
this year.”

The Lady Panthers will be up against
some tough competition this weekend.
Lewis has watched his team make some
great strides this year, and he sees the
Big East Championships as a chance to
go one step further.

“I’m pretty optimistic,” Lewis said.
“We have come a long way, but I
would like to see us take a couple more
giant steps.” '

The team will get the chance this
weekend.

 following successful weekend

By Roy Bigler
Staff Writer

This past weekend was an extreme-
ly busy one for the men on Pitt’s track
team, as they attended a total of three
different meets. On Saturday, they
were at home with the women hosting
the Pitt Invitational; on Sunday, the
hurdlers went to George Mason
University in Fairfax, Va. to compete;
and also on Sunday, Lee McRae and
the two-mile relay team went to
Chicago to compete in the Bally meet.

The men did very well at home, plac-
ing people in amongst the top per-
formers in a large number of events.
In the 50-yard dash, Luke Gatzen and
Vernon Reed finished first and second;
in the 300-meter run, Vernon Reed‘ was
first and Bernard McCoy was second;
in the 500-meter run, Jesse Mikell and
Pete Hurley finished with the top two
spots; in the 1,000-yard run, Tery
Brookover and Bob Harvey were se-

cond and third; in the mile, Ken Pic-
ciano and Joe Ninos finished second
and third; in the high jump, Greg
Dushaw was third; in the triple jump,
Alan Tunson was second; and the mile
relay team placed first.

“We had a good meet out of those
people that stayed at Pitt, and that
helped us out,” said the men’s coach
John Vasvary. He had been resting
some people, and others were out due
to injuries which made the performance
of his men at the invitational very
important.

However, good performances were
also turned in at Bally, and at George
Mason by the people who competed at
those meets. At George Mason, Eric
Cannon placed second in the 55-meter
hurdles with a time of 7.25 seconds.
This time qualiﬁed Cannon for the
NCAA meet. He had been trying to
find the competition that would be
strong enough to push him into a good
race, but up until this time, he had not
been able to do so.

In addition to that, Lee McRae and
the two-mile relay team were able to
take another leap forward in their quest
to be the best in the nation. At the Bal-
ly meet in Chicago, McRae finished an
impressive first with a school record
in the 50-meter dash. He ran a time of”
5.70 seconds, which is consistent with
the world-class speed. he has shown
throughout the season. The two-mile
relay team also placed first in the meet
with a time of 7:31.73. This was the
first time that Bob Weiner, Thomas
Boggan, Dave Moore and Joe Daniels
had run together in quite a while.

“I was obviously very pleased with
the good performances that Lee and the
others turned in,” said Vasvary. “It
will be good for Lee’s confidence and
for the confidence of the whole team.”

The women were also in action this
past weekend, but unlike the men, they
decided to just remain at home and do
battle here. They turned in a very im-
pressive group effort that resulted in a
number of f1rst—place ﬁnishes against
some tough competition.
