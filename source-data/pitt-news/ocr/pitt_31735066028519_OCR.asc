Zelda's could lose liquor license

By Mark Gordon
Editor in Chief

The owner of Zelda’s Greenhouse, who claims his business
is in jeopardy since state police raided the bar in September,
said he wants a second chance, but state police are saying they
want his liquor license taken away. 1

Over 200 people, mostly Pitt students, were cited for under-
age drinking at’ the Bouquet Street bar Sept. 25 in what police
called one of the biggest alcohol raids in state history.

‘-‘There is no way I'can survive as a bar, especially because
the over-21 student body has turned their backs,” Barney
Silverman said in an interview with The Pitt News.

Before the raid the bar was a popular place for Pitt students,
drawing big crowds on Thursday through Saturday nights.

Sgt. Ken Jones, district office commander of the Bureau of
Liquor Control Enforcement, said if it were up to him, Zelda’s
would be shut down permanently. ’

“It’s in the hands of the commonwealth now, [but] we asked

that his license be revoked,” Jones said.

Attorneys representing the state could not be reached for
comment.

Silvermansaid he realizes Zelda’s was a prime target for the
BLCE, but there are other bars in Oakland that serve people
under 21. _

“If they were going to hit someplace, then this was the
place,” he said. “[But] the raid didn’t stop kids from drink-
1ng.”

Almost 240 people under 21 were cited that Thursday night,
when draft beers are 25 cents each. During the raid, there was
too much confusion and chaos to properly cite each individ-
ual. Police took down information so people could be cited
through the mail.

“All the citations have been issued, and some of the individ-
uals have already had hearings,” Jones said.

Silverman said he is disappointed in the low number of stu-
dents who have come into the bar since the raid.

“Ze1da’s has been here 20 years. It’s a tradition.”

Presidential hopefuls
debate the issues

By Nicole Walz «
Staff Writer

Student apathy, a multicultural
center, allocations, and improved
communication were some issues
battled out by the
Student Government Board pres-
idential candidates.

Candidates were given the
chance to make opening state-
ments as to what issues were
important to them.

“When I first came to this cam-
pus, I felt somewhat isolated,”
said candidate Janera Solomon.
Since then she has worked to
increase student retention with
the Chancellor’s office so that
others won’t feel the same way.

All candidates agreed students

needed to take amore active role
in the selection of the board and
the issues once the board is elect-
ed. In past elections, only 10 to
15 percent of the student body
has voted.

“We deal with an incredible
amount of issues, programs and
concerns,” said candidate John
Callahan. “I hope the members
sitting on the panel with me
tonight realize we are not up
there for the renumeration, not
for the publicity; we are there to
represent you.”

A student from the audience
asked about unity among the stu-
dents on campus, and candidate
Scott Dolin suggested student
organizations become more

Low proposed will
odd to police power

By Solomon Childs
For The Pitt News

At a time when the
authority of Brentwood
police is under scrutiny,
the Pennsylvania state

legislature is .consider— .

ing a bill that will give
Pittsburgh police the
power to arrest without
a warrant.

The proposed legisla-
tion states if there is
“probable cause” that a
city ordinance is bro-
ken, Pittsburgh police
officers can make an
arrest without a warrant
or even seeing the ille-
gal action.

The bill

enforcement officials
statewide to make war-
rantless arrests. It will
also give police across
the state power they did
not previously have to

arrest for the violation-

of city ordinances
“when there is ongoing
conduct that imperils
the personal security of
any person or endangers
public or private proper-
ty.” ’ -

Margaret McCormick-
Baron, assistant to
Mayor Murphy for
intergovernmental rela-
tions, said the adminis-
tration has not sought to
give the city police the
power to make warrant-
less arrests when they
didn’t witness a viola-
tion. _

“I don’t know where
that charge came from,”
she said.

McCormick—Baron
made it clear the city
will provide officers

_ expands,
arrest powers for law’

' with strict guidelines for

making warrantless
arrests, and the city will
probably require offi-
cers to have witnessed a
violation before using
their arrest powers.

The legislation, which 

barely passed in the
state Senate by a vote of

-26 to 19, now goes

before the House of
Representatives. '

City administration
has lobbied hard for this
legislature to give offi-
cers the power to crack
down on underage
drinking, public drunk-
enness, and disorderly
conduct and to_enforce a
proposed curfew on
youths under 17 years
old.

Opponents of the bill
say it infringes on the
Fourth Amendment pro-
tection against illegal
search and seizure.

Larry Frankel of the
American Civil
Liberties Union of
Pennsylvania questions
the wisdom of giving
this power during a time
when the public has lost
confidence in the police
because of incidences of
racism and corruption in
the Philadelphia and
Los Angeles police
departments.

Mark Ramirez, presi-
dent of Pi Lambda Phi,
is aggravated by the
thought of giving city
police extended arrest
powers.

“Pittsburgh police
have already abused
their power by entering
our fraternity house-

wants to give them even
more power that the consti-

the Pittsburgh police get this
power, we all have to realize

involved.

“I would extend an invita-
tion for student group presi-
dents and representatives to
speak to SGB,” Dolin said.

According to Dolin, one
way to decrease apathy is to
create a multicultural center
around which all student
organizations can rally. It
would include areas for
African-Americans, women,
Asians and other minority
groups. Solomon proposed
that SGB read the proposal
for an African cultural center
to dispel the misconceptions.

Regarding other Pitt cam-
puses and other area col-
leges, Mike Fuller said, “We
not only need to work with
them, but learn from them.”

Restructuring the alloca-
tions was also a big topic
during the presidential
debate.

“It is indeed effective, but
you can not stand back and
applaud it. You need to keep
working to makesure it
remains the best way,” said
Andy Wuertele.

_“The allocations process
may not be perfect, and, by
far, it isn’t exactly the way

we would like it to be, but it

is the fairest and most dili-
gent way to distribute money
to student organizations,”
said Callahan.

Certain groups voiced the
concern that some clubs
receive more money than
others. The Allocations
Committee bases it on the
number of students involved
in each organization. Some
candidates disagreed with
the current system.

“Any group with ten peo-
ple can get money from SGB

. certain dumb clubs get
money allocated to them,”
said Fuller.

All candidates and the cur-

rent SGB president, Julie

Crowell, encouraged stu-
dents they should get out and
vote despite bad weather.

Zelda's had its chance

Does everyone have their Kleenex handy? You’re going to need
them when you hear this. It would seem that the owner of the infa-
mous Zelda’s Greenhouse has made a heart—rending plea for help.

‘There is no way I can survive as a bar,” cried Silverman. Wring
out your newsprint, folks, we can all hear the weeping from here.
It would seem that the Zelda’s raid that took place on Sept. 25,
resulting in over 200 citations for underage drinking, has caused an
enlightening few months.

Perhaps the light got turned on for Mr. Silverrnan when he real-
ized that his establishment had been breaking the law in mass
quantity, almost as massive as the quantity of beer consumed by
underage drinkers in Zelda’s on a Thursday night. And then the
light probably got a little brighter when Mr. Silvennan realized his
liquor license is probably out the window. (Too bad the police had
the back alley blocked, or some of the people cited in September
might have been out the same one.)

Silverrnan feels that the student population has “turned their
backs” on him. After all, “Zelda’s has been here 20 years. It’s a tra-
dition.” And so, Mr. Silverrnan would like a second chance.

We think he should get that second chance. Think about it.
Where else are all the people under 21 going to go to drink?
Where else could you get drunk on cheap beer for under $1?
Where else can you finally use that library card your mother insist-
ed you have when you arrived at campus (though she probably
didn’t intend for you to use it as identification)?

Sorry, Mr. Silverman. but a second chance? We think your sec-
ond, third, and fourth chances (at least) have already proved that
you don’t deserve another one.

A new admission pass

Beginning on Nov. 27, the Towers Lobby is going to be ﬂooded
with people standing in line to get new student IDs. Everyone who
is on either a meal plan, the Choice Dollars plan or both will have
to get a new picture taken for the new IDs, which will have a mag-
netic stripe on the back, similar to the new Pennsylvania driver’s
licenses.

The rationale behind the new IDs is to make it easier and faster
for customers to purchase food with their BLOCKS or Choice
Dollars. Supposedly the magnetic stripe will make the wait in line
a little shorter, since one quick swipe is all you need.

But one quick swipe is exactly all you need. We don’t know
exactly what information that little stripe will contain, but one
thing is certain. Anyone who finds (or steals) someone else’s ID
will have a lot easier time using it. Employees of food services
barely look at ID pictures now, but at least they may have to look
at them a little closer now than they will in January.

Computerized coding on one little magnetic stripe can be a dan-
gerous thing. A criminal with a decent knowledge of computers
could have a field day with one of these cards. The university may
decide at some point to expand the cards’ usefulness to include
other data on that little stripe. So make sure you keep a close eye
on your new ID. . -

But at least you’ll have a new ticket into Zelda’s!

Anti—choice, Pro—death agree

it when I see it.” These
were the words of Supreme
Court Justice Potter Stewart.
He was referring to obscenity;
however, it struck me that the
same sort of reference could be

Ican’t define it, but “I know

made to ‘‘life.’’ The deﬁnition I

of life has become a burning
question recently because of
the red—hot dispute over abor-
tion now taking place in
Congress. The House just
passed, with a surprisingly
comfortable margin, a bill that
would make a specific abortion
procedure, known as “dilation
and extraction,” a criminal
offense punishable by up to
two years in prison. The abor-
tion technique is very rare and
is usually employed in the late
stages of pregnancy.
Essentially, the procedure
involves actually delivering the
fetus feet-first thru the birth
canal, and while the head is
still inside, the base of the skull
is pierced and the brain is suc-
tioned, allowing the head to be
removed easily. I’ll get back to
this specific issue later. What is
truly spectacular about the
abortion conﬂict in general is
the extreme polarization that
exists on each side. One might
think that such a volatile dis-
agreement between so many
people is simply irreconcilable.
Well, you’ll be pleased to know
that Denver, with his stunning
sense of reason and his remark-
able wit, is here to shed light
on this issue.

The true issues involved in
the abortion conflict are con-
siderably convoluted by the
brazen labels each side attaches
to itself and to its opponents.
Pro-abortion activists are
labelled “pro-choice” and
“anti—life,” while anti—abortion—
ists are labelled “pro-life” and
“anti—choice.” But these titles
are lies! The sole purpose of
these titles is“ to attack the
opponents directly rather than
to attack the opponents’ argu-

\ ments. But the simple (yet con-
fusing) fact is that people

   

Denver Das

involved in this debate don’t
attack their opponents’ argu-
ments, because in the abortion
conﬂict everyone agrees with
his/her opponents, in principle.
Is that nutty. or what? The
abortion conﬂict exists because
of a contradiction in two gener-
ally accepted principles; and
get this, neither principle is
freedom of choice. Rather, the
two principles that generate
this conﬂict, and that both sides
agree on, are the sanctity of life
and the right _to control one’s
own body. The latter principle
is not the same as the freedom
of choice because choice is
much more general (for exam-
ple, the right to choose to rape
someone is not a generally
accepted principle).

Again, I emphasize that
everyone (in general) accepts
both of these principles. The
sole problem is that abortion is
supported by one of these
while at the same time it is con-
tested by the other. That is,
these two tenets contradict each
other; however, there simply is
no contest between the relative
weight of these two principles.
The sanctity of human life is
among the very highest of all
human creeds. I challenge any-
one to find an instance where a
person’s right to control his/her
own body has come before
another person’s right to exist.

Unfortunately, this conclu-
sion does not adequately
resolve the abortion issue
because “life” is not well-
defined. It is not clear precisely
which characteristics of life are
sacred. How do we distinguish
a bug from a fetus? So it is not
entirely clear that the sanctity

of life is even being violated
during an abortion; however, it
is clear that the right to control
one’s body is being violated by
not allowing a person to have
an abortion. Sigh  so the
abortion debate is really a con-

-_ ﬂict due to the possible Viola-

tion of an extremely important
principle versus the certain
violation of a less important
principle. How does one logi-
cally resolve such a dilemma?
It is not clear, and that is why
there is a conﬂict today. Until
we can precisely define what is
sacred about life, the abortion
issue will remain logically
insurmountable, but that is the
only obstacle.

This all brings me back to the
recent bill passed in the House,
and it brings me back to the
words of the esteemed Justice
Stewart. Despite the‘ fact that I
cannot define life, “I know it
when I see it.” It is obvious that
a fetus in the final trimester is
“human life.” These infants
have fully functional organs; in
particular. there is brain activity
and the heart is active. When
these infants are being partially
removed from the mother. they
kick their feet and clasp their
hands. It is “intuitively clear to

the most casual observer” that-

such a baby possesses human
life. It is likewise absolutely
clear that someone who could
bring himself to stab one of
these infants in the back of the
head with scissors, open the
scissors up, insert a high—pow-
ered suction tube into the hole
and suck out the child’s brain is
nothing’ short of a cold—blooded
murderer, and two years in
prison is too good for him. The
House did the right thing, and
regardless of your feelings of
abortion in general. if you do
not agree with this decision,
either you’ve had your brains
sucked out, or you are not
human.

The Lady Panthers volleyball team
closedlout their Big East regular season
schedule last weekend notching convinc-
ing wins over Rutgers and Seton Hall.
With the victories Pitt improved its over-
all recordgto 17-8 and 10-1 in the Big
East.

It took the Lady Panthers a little under
an hour and a half to sweep Rutgers 3-0
Saturday afternoon. Pitt eased by 15-5 in
the first game, but fell behind in the sec-
ond only to fight back to a 15-13 victory.
Head coach Cindy Alvear attributed

the slip to a lack of concentration and-

motivation, but the team came back in the
third period to win 15-3.

AnneMarie Tarara led the Panthers with
13 kills and a .344 hitting percentage,
while Jennie Driscol and Sara Mitchell
each had 12 kills, hitting .133 and .500

respectively. Freshman Jessica Van Der.

Mallie filled in nicely for Sarah Mikla,
chalking up 10 kills with an efficient
.588 hitting percentage. Junior Stephanie
Dufresne was an important cog in Pitt’s
offense with 50 assists, she also led the
team in hitting percentage with .600, con-
necting on six of 10 attempts.

The win was Pitt’s fifth in a row, while
the Scarlet Knights dropped to 11-17 and
0-10 in the Big East. .

In their second game of the weekend,
Pitt squared off Sunday_ against Seton
Hall in a match that turned out to be very
similar to its first one. The Lady Panthers
played a solid first game, winning 15-6,
but again were too complacent in the sec-
ond, in which they squeezed-out a 15-13
victory; Pitt responded accordingly in the
final game, blasting the Pirates 15-1.

The game marked the return of Mikla,
who dished out 12 kills, second on the
team to Driscoll, who had 13 kills at a
.400 hitting percentage. Dufresne provid-
ed 37 assists, while Tarara added eight
kills and led the team with 12 digs. Seton

 

Hall dropped to 14-17 and 3-8 in the Big
East with the loss.

Overall, Pitt volleyball coach Cindy
Alvear was pleased with how her team
played in both matches.-

“Both matches were identical. We had
big early leads, but then we lost our moti-
vation and concentration and got compla-
cent,” she said. “We got behind in both of

xx

the second games, but we came back and
played harder.”

Going into the Big East Tournament
this weekend, Alvear was not overly wor-
ried about a lack of motivation on the part
of her team.

“The intensity will be there,” said the
third-year coach, “but there is some con-

Cross country teams run through mudin Boston

By Geoff Moak
Staff Writer

It was a busy day last
Saturday at Franklin Parkin
Boston. The Pitt men’s cross
country team ran in the
District II lC4A cross coun-
try championship race, and
the women competed in the
ECAC championship.._Earlier
in the day, the Massachusetts
state high school cross coun-

try championships were held

on the same course.

“It worked out well for
everything that was going
on,” said Pitt coach Dave
Sobal.

Seeing the high school
races actually helped Sobal
plan a strategy for his team.
One of the turns on the
course was covered with a
thin layer of mud. Most of
the runners in both the high
school and college races ran
about 15 yards out of their
way to avoid the mud. Sobal
told his team to go through
the mud, and the strategy
paid off.

“Frank [Nesko] passed
about ten people not by run-
ning any harder, but just by
running smarter,” Sobal said.
“I don’t know why every-
body else didn’t do what we
did. It was amusing to see-so
many people run so far out of

Nesko, who finished in 36th
place with a time of 31:23.
Martin McCarthy of Iona
won the race in 29:44.

As a team, Pitt was well in
the back of the pack, coming
in 17th place of 23 teams
with 465 points. Georgetown

usual distance. Still, some of
the men turned in good per-
formances.

“For Matt Samuel, it was

his best race of the year. It
was Rich Wa1sh’s best race
of-the year,” Sobal said.
Samuel ran the course in
32:56, good for 108th place.
Walsh was 127th in 33:27.
Pitt’s top finisher was Frank

same could be said of the
women. Of the 16 schools
that fielded complete teams,
Pitt was last with 424 points.
Villanova won the meet with
33 points.

Like the men, the women
had some good individual
performances.

“Stephanie Ellsworth had a
solid race,” Sobal said. “For
Melanie Ishman and Natasha

Van Reil, it was their best
race this year.”

Ishman came in 101st place
in 20:01. Van Reil was 110th
in 20:26. Ellsworth was Pitt’s
top finisher, 74th place over-
all in 19:15. Vil1anova’s
Jennifer Rhines easily won
the race in 16:34.

It’s tough to fault Pitt for
not trying. For men and
women, there were two
races, a championship race
for individuals and teams try-
ing to qualify for nationals
and a university race for less
competitive teams. The Pitt
men and women both chose
to-run at the championship
level.

“We would’ve been very
competitive in the university

_race. Frank [Nesko] may

have won,” Sobal said. “I
feel it’s always better to be
striving and pushing your-
self. Both teams can walk
away from this race with
their heads up high.”

The teams came into
Saturday’s race looking to
redeem themselves after a

not win this weekend, their

By Mike Kovak
Asst. Sports Editor

Saturday night at the Fitzgerald Field
House, Pitt’s offensive balance proved to

“be too much for the Melbourne Tigers in

its exhibition opener.

With 12 Panthers receiving playing time,
no Pitt player logged more than 29 minutes
or less than eight minutes in Pitt’s 82-76
victory.

“I wouldn’t be surprised to play a 12-

‘player rotation sometimes,” Pitt head

coach Ralph Willard said. “There’ll proba-
bly be 10 players that get significant play-
ing time.”

Starting Pitt center Gerald Jordan was
Pitt’s lone standout. In 24 minutes, Jordan
led the Panthers with 15 points and 14
rebounds, including seven offensive
boards. ‘

The game was Jordan’s ﬁrst as a Panther.

- He sat out last season after transferring

from Morgan State.

‘This game is a sign of things to come. I
should have a good season,” Jordan said.

Coach Willard envisions good things as
well.

“[Jordan] is going to be a good player,”
Willard said. “He’s going to surprise a lot
of people; not too many people know
about him.”

After Jordan, the only other two Panthers
who scored in double ﬁgures were retum-
ing point guard Jeny McCullough with 11
points and coach’s son Kevin Willard, who
contributed 10 points. McCullough also
dished out seven assists and had four
steals.

Eights were wild for forward Chad
Varga. Varga had eight points, eight
rebounds and eight shots. Varga swiped

, club, Pitt committed 23 turnovers. Every

four steals also. Jordan, McCullough and
freshman sensation Vonteego Cummings
all registered eight shots as well. Nobody
on the Pitt team took more than eight shots. _,

For the Kmart-sponsored Melbourne *
Tigers, former Seton Hall standout
Andrew Gaze took 20 shots. That is eight
more than any other Tiger. He also scored
30 points, which was 16 more than any
teammate.

Pitt had six players nail two shots apiece
and four players hit three shots. Five play-
ers drained three-point shots, with starting
two-guard Andre Alridge hitting two. The
only Panther not to score was shooting
guard Jason Maile.

Pitt did an outstanding job cleaning the
glass. The Panthers outrebounded the
Tigers 42-30, with a 21-9 advantage on the
offensive glass. For the Panthers, Alridge
and Maile were the only players not to col-
lect a board. .

The heralded freshman class displayed
collective balance, but hopefully its num-
bers will increase as tl1e'season goes on.
Cummings scored five, Michael Gill : -~ ~; 9 ~_

in eight minutes and center Mark Blount _ A   
and forward Andre Howard each drained ‘ ’  '2   ‘i
two hoops apiece for four points. . ,

“Our major focus was to get people    
playing time,” Willard said.

Nine Panthers had personal fouls, but
none had more than four. Eight Panthers
had assists. In the worst stat of the day, and
a problem that plagued last season’s 10-18

player committed at least one turnover, but
no Panther committed more than three.

“We didn’t do a lot of things well offen-
sively and defensively, but we played
hard,” Willard said.

cem about the ability to stay
focused.”

Pitt will be a lock to make
the NCAA tournament if it
walks away with the Big East
trophy as it has for the last
seven seasons. That streak
could be snapped this year by
Notre Dame, which just joined
the Big East this year and is
responsible for Pitt’s only con-
ference loss this season.

Alvear feels that a match
against Notre Dame would be
a “toss, up.” Both Pitt and
Notre Dame are balanced
teams, and the match should
be a good one.

“It will come down to who
makes the fewest unforced’
errors,” said Alvear, who plans

"Alvear felt that adding a
team like Notre Dame to the
conference was a good move.
‘‘I welcome the competition.
Adding a team like Notre
Dame can only be good,” she
said. -
And even if the Panthers do

chances are still good at get-
ting. into the NCAA tourna-
ment on account of their
strong schedule. Alvear feels
that winning one match in

solidify their position for a

average, and Tom “Brick Wall”
Barasso has a 2.94 average.

5. The Pens have played only
five home games. All teams
with more points have, you
guessed it, played more home
games. Championship teams
win on the road, just ask the San
Francisco 49ers who crushed
the overly arrogant Dallas
Cowboys on Sunday. The Pens
have earned 11 points on the
road so far this season.

6. The Penguins have the
three top scorers in the National
Hockey League. The most gift-
ed offensive player ever to play
the game, Mario Lemieux, leads
the league with 37 points.
Hmm. I’m pretty sure that
‘The Best One” has taken a few
games off as well.

Plus superstars, Jaroinir ‘‘I
like pretty girls and C.J.
Bamey’s” Jagr and Ron Francis
are tied right behind Lemieux
with 31 points.

7. As I’ve said before, and
I’m right when I say things, the
Philadelphia Flyers will not
pose a legitimate threat to the
Stanley Cup.

Why, one might ask? The
answer is painfully obvious.
The Flyers have ONE line. The
Legion of Doom is it, and that’s
that. When will Flyer fans real-
ize this?

The Penguins are the deepest
team in hockey. Lemieux, J agr,
Francis, Thomas Sandstrom,
Petr Nedved, Zubov, Markus
Naslund, Bryan Smolinski —
the list goes on forever.

Depth, unstoppability and
defense wins championships,
along with experience. The
Pens have all of these, and I’m
going to be laughing all year
long.
