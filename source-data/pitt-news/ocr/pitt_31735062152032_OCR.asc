Heart Hop
Plans Set

By Women

Men To Receive Invitations
From Coeds For Affair
At Schenley Soon

Walt Whitman said, “Stranger, if
you pa.ssing meet me and desire to
speak to me, why should you not
speak to me? And why should I not
speak to you?” This is rule one in
giving and receiving a bid to the
Heart Hop.

“If rule one is followed there need
be no regrets; but if it is not, many
sleepless nights might result because
of the knowledge that not even an
eﬁ'o1’t was made to know him or her
better.” Suc-h is the unanimous opin-
ion of the committee for the annual
Heart H-op.

Committee members for the Hop
already have things well under way.
The place will be the Schenley, the
time--February 12. The orchestra
will be selected within the next ten
days and further notices will be made
concerning the affair from time to
time.

The price of the tickets is $1.50
and members of the committee will
be selling them soon after the sec-
ond semester begins. It is customary.
since the dance is staged by the four
women’s classes to divide the proﬁts,
equally.

Barbar-a Th-omas, BA37, president‘
of the senior class, is chairman of
the dance a.nd the business manager
is lone Williams, C38. Miss Williams
is also treasurer of WSGA.

Organization, Functions

Dr. Vincent W. Lanfear, dean of

Commenting on the SFA Assembly
and Executive Committee, Dr. Lan-
fear said, “The present makeup of
the SEA constitution, providing for
the popularl.y-elected assembly and
the executive committee chosen by
the assembly, is a model for student
govermnent groups at other colleges.”

Students with ability are always

“When the election results were
announced, students knew exactly
who would receive all important ac-
tivities appointments long in advance
of their selection, simply because of
the system of campus politics.

“The organization of SFA helped
to break down that kind of control
to make room for all students with
ability regardless of their ‘connec-
tions,’ ” Dr. Lanfear said.

V\'itl1 just a little over a week left

for the 1937 Journeyman. John C.
Gerber. instructor in Englisli and
adviser to Quill Club, honorary lit-
erary fra.terni.ty, announces that
there is still room for many more
articles.

Last night at a. m_cct.i_n_g of the club.
which is sponsoring the p11b".iv:.'at.ici1,
Mr. Gerber urged of the
club and oljlierf students i.nt.er«.-..:tctl in

will be welcomed, Kenneth Houp,
 president of Quill Club and edi-
tor of this year's J ourneymanf. pointed
out at the same meeting.

“We do not wish to create the inn
pression on campus that Journey1na_n
is made up wholly of serious or the
so-called ‘high-brow’ material,” he
said. “Hu.-norous articles, poems, and
short plays have just as much place
in a publication which is representa-
tive, as Journeyman is int.e1'1dc«l to
be, of the highest type of work Uni-
versity students can produce.”

All manusc.ripts, whether in play
form, poetry or pro;-5c, must be type
written in the conventio_n.'ul style:
doul)1e-space(l on only one side of tllw
paper.

Material may be mailecl or de|.i\'-

Genus Sophus!

Dr. S. H. Williams To Speak
To Sophomores Friday

Dr. Samuel H. Williams, professor
of biology, will desert his protozoa
and butterﬂies long enough on Friday
to address sophomores who attend
their annual luncheon. The time has
been set for 12:45 o’clock at Heinz
House.

“Sophomores will prove that they
are brave when it comes to ﬁnals by
taking time out to attend the event,”
says Ann Whippo, who as social chair-
man of her class, is in general charge
of the affair.

Since the program will be centered

is L11: last day before ﬁnals, the so-
cial committee has named it the Final

All tickets must be purchased be-
fore Thursday noon. They are priced

committee selling tickets are Miss
Whippo, chairman; Mary Ruth Good-

Classics Students
Hold Roman Feast
Zllinus Field Mice

“Oh” yes, sir, our ﬁeld ‘mice are
very nice this evening. How will you
have them, broiled or roasted?”

You didn’t know that the Romans
ate ﬁeld mice? Why, when Caesar's
legions crossed the Alps they might
have taken thousands of ﬁeld mice
along to supply them with their vita-
mins A, B, D and G. '

The Classical Club is going to resur-
rect one of these Roman banquets on
February 18, at Heinz House.

The ﬁeld mice, though, are to be
left on the menu. Otherwise this
decidedly unique event will feature
all other Roman delicacies, from
“eggs to apples,” and typical Roman
entertainment.

Janet Crosby, Ed38, general chair-
man of the event, warns all prospec-
tive banqueters that a condition of
admission will be the wearing of a
toga. Mama’s best white sheet will
do nicely. Superior people may add
a purple stripe to the toga, thereby
becoming patricians.

German Exile Tells Inquiry
Of Need For Positive
Peace Program

DRAWS LIXRGE CROWD

By John Martinco

The only way to prevent aggres-
sion by an ambitious dictator is to
have a world united against him,
said Ernst 'I‘oller, exiled German
playwright, Monday before Inquiry
Forum’s largest crowd of the year.

Speaking precisely with an evident
German accent, Mr. Toller empha-
sized the need for a positive peace
program to supplant the current wide-
spread wave of negative paciﬁsm. A

"I was a religionist, an absolut-
ist, and a pacifist,” the playwright
declared, “but reality set me tight.
The moral plan of an individual is
one thing. The political and social
problem of a government is an-
other. '

~ “It is our task,” he continued,
“to avoid a situation where a world
dictator will attack freedom. ,We
must force peace on a dictator‘ be-
fore the situation results in war.
Dictators do not respect polite
words.”

Mr. Toller contested the opinion
that world paciﬁsm would be com-
plete with peace in Europe. The
state which ﬁres the ﬁrst shot, he
said,. is not necessarily the breaker
of peace. The breaker of peace is
the nation whose foundation is mili-
taristic, with a youth training pro-
gram along strict nationalistic lines.

He referred speciﬁcally to Ger-
many under the Hitler dictatorship.
The Nazi leader, the speaker point-
ed out, distorts the symbols and
words of democracy to Fit his own
meanings.

“He takes the great words of hu-
manity,” he aﬁirmed, “empties them,
and uses them for his own advantage.
Oppression at one time is called op-
pression, and at another time is called
a, requirement of the state.

“An abstract peace will not help
We will have to face realities. Peace
without social justice cannot exist.

“We must ﬁght for a world peace,”
he concluded, “where freedom rules
and where all racial groups have the
same rights. One day there will be
a real peace when the era of the
World War and militarism will seem
to us like a world of cannibalism.”

Metal Department
Receives Citation

E. A. Holbrook, dean of the
Schools of Engineering and Mines,
announces that the department of
metallurgical engineering has just
been approved by the state of New
York.

New courses and the acquisition of
new equipment, which gives the de-
partment an unusually complete lab-
oratory for the study of iron, steel
and the alloys of the different metals,
were responsible for the citation.

A large Bausch and Lomb metal-
lographic microscope is included in
the new equipment. This instrument
will magnify the structure of metals
as much as 2,000 ‘times, at the same
time photographing the enlarged
\7le'VV.

Other new equipment includes a
high frequency induction furnace,
which will enable students to melt
metals quickly.

of commercial thought, and it dorn'inated“ more

' than a" century of~‘sArnerican; thought. It stamped
our lives with the philosophy of the counting "

tlosophy but rather an ‘inadequate one’. _ It had'

no poetry connected with)‘ it,_.-.' for it‘ had, no

' ‘thought of , preparing“ the innumerable John Does

for ‘the’ ex-ig"er'ijcies o£.“a”s_upernatural' life. to «come. .

to believe in. And attaining an education is for
the greater part a “struggle, single-handedly,
against odds.” Although some colic-ridden nag

The recent (liscussioii upon the question “Should
mercy killings be legalized?” is interestiiig. ’I.‘hc protag»
onists of mercy killing point ou«t_,that a suffering patient,
absolutely incurable, would be better off dead than alive.
‘They use the familiar illustration that “putting a suffer-
ing dog to death is merciful-—wliy should it not be so
in human bei1i'gs'I” ' -

Manifoldproblems are bought out. Is the siiffering

.. m,an,_ab_soluttely" useless to the world and to himself,

better off dead than" alive? What should he the reac-

tion of the doctor who isrequested by his patient to

be put “outof misery”? ‘Is the civilization of the

highest animal, man, improved by keeping ‘alive those
who are virtually useless to theworld? ‘

In the animal king-dom,—we know, the unﬁtgcamiot
survive. They must adapt or perish. Tli_at is the Law

A Swell Movie . . .

Mo.nday’s Pitt_Bits contai-ned such
a vague pun that even*the copy read-
ers missed it, -which caused them_ to
over-estimate one ﬁgure by just
$79,920. As originally written, the
statementwas, “ ‘Spring Class,’ the
campus movie . . cost all of $80.000
(eighty dollars) to produce."

However, the period was changed

. to-a comma in the cost ﬁgure so that

it read “$80,000” (eighty thousand

‘dOll,aI“S),/ which would be a sizable
-‘amount even for a Hollywood pic-

ture. . . . Also, Mr. Elliot said the
purpose, of the ﬁlm was to determine
the value of movie making in class-
room work, and not what I previ-
ously reported. The proofreaders
and myself apologize, Mr. Elliot.
IT IS a swell ‘movie. A
