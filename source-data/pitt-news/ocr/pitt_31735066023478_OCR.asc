Pitt News Staff Writer

Charges have been ﬁled
through the campus judicial
system by Jeff Miller con-‘
cerning the controversy over
whether Student Government
Board presidential candidate
Kim Watterson had access to
his scholastic records without V‘
his permission. I

A student’s scholastic
records are considered private
and may only be released to the
individual student, according
to the Buckley Amendment.

I Speciﬁc charges in the case
have not been released to the
public also because of the

Buckley Amendment. Such
information is considered part
of a student’s scholastic record,
according to Charlene Hunter,
coordinator of the campus
judicial system.

Watterson said, however,
the “gist” of the charges are
that “I slandered Jeff and that
I solicited and received access
to his personal papers.”

Miller said that there are five
charges related to the student
code, speciﬁcally two charges
under offenses related to
oersons, two charges under
offenses related to property,
and one charge under offenses
related to the operation of the
university.

’ ial Committee,

The slander charges occured
“by allegedly generating false
information with regard to my
eligibility to be placed on the
ballot for SGB elections prior to
it being a matter of public
record,” Miller added.

The controversy began at the
end of October when Miller, a
would-be SGB presidential
candidate, was trying to place
his name on the election ballot.

Steve Fendler, chairman of
the Student Government Judic-
and Mark
Suekoff, chairman of the
Student Government Elections
Committee, discussed the pos-
sibility with \Miller on Thurs-
day, October 25, that he did not

meet the 2.5 quality point
average required of all-candi-
dated" for SGB, according to
Miller. Miller says he did not
know his QPA fell below the 2.5
requiremei .i..til Friday, Oct-
ooer 26, one day later.

Fendler said he heard the
rumor about Miller’s QPA from
Watterson "when she asked
Fendler and Suekoff about
Miller’s eligibility.

Rumors had been “ﬂying
around the office” about
Miller’s eligibility, according to
-Watterson, and some people
had approached her, inquiring.
about the situation.

“I am not the only source of
the rumor or the onlyirelayer,”

Watterson said at the time.“I’@
was probably like a domino
effect.”

Watterson said yesterday -
that there is insufficient evi-
dence to support the charges
brought against her by Miller.

“As of yet, nobody has cited
any evidence to prove what I
am being charged with,”
Watterson said.

“I feel that when everybody
is brought in to testify, and the
whole story is out, they will see
there is no evidence and that all
the charges are based on
speculation,” she added.

Hunter (acting on Miller’s

Student Government Board 79:lt"s Successes and Failures

‘ [By CINDY COHEN

. Pitt News Staff Writer

With Student Government Board‘

elections concluding today it seems
appropriate to look back on the
failures and accomplishments of
the present board.

When interviewed by ‘The Pitt

News, the majority of the board

agreed on the lack of time they had’

in office. Because ‘of the
restructuring of the election
calendar last year, the board is
serving a shorter term than other
have in the past. , _ '

“We suffered on potential
production in the sense that we
didn’t have "enough time,” 'SGB
President Stan‘ Galanski said.

“In addition to the shortened
term, as soon as they took office
they began the allocation process.

“The major shortcoming was our
inexperience,” said board member

Cindy L‘eMatteo. With allocations
comingso quickly we didn’t have
time to get used to anything.”
With the long, and often bitter
allocations process at the begin-
ning of their term in office, many
board members thought it was a
roiigh beginning. , '
“We had a lot of trouble working

together. Often we didn’t know
what each of us was doing and
there was a lot of red tape,” board
member Helen Gianella said.
“There was a lot of dissention.
Plus, there was the infighting
among the campus groups trying to
get funding,” board member '1"{‘;m
Watterson said. . . '

American Hostage s Letter From

By CINDY COHEN

Pitt News Staff Writer :

Copies of a letter allegedly
written -_by one of the American
hostages in Tehran were dis-
tributed all over the Pitt campus

. yesterday.

Signed “Kevin”, the letter says:
“We are still being held but we are
treated very“well...” The letter
gives no last name for “Kevin,”
but'is addressed to the hostage’s

family and suggests “maybe
someone or something should» tell
(convince) Carter to take care of his
American people first and not care
of some stupid Shah.”

The letter was distributed as a
press release from the Embassy of

the Islamic Republic of Iran in '

Washington. Hossein, Ava, in-
formational officer at the embassy,
said “Wereceived this release on
the telex from Tehran two days ago
and made it public yesterday.”
The hostages have now been held
for 10 days. ‘
Speculation as-to the solution of’
this crisis has ranged from military
intervention to mediation by the
Palestine Liberation Organization.
Iran’s Minister of foreign affairs,
Abol Hassan Bani-Sadr, sent a
letter to the secretary general of
the United Nations, Kurt Wald-
heim, asking for an emergency
meeting of the Security Council.

“There may even be a meeting of’

the General Assembly, ‘because

there is a climate of war

prevailing,’ ’ _ said Ava.
Bandi-Sadr’s action amost cer-'

tainly came with the iknowledge .

and approval of the Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini. During
Khomeini’s 15-year exile, he spent
months living with Bani-Sadr in’
Paris. The two are very close.
The question still unsolved is
how are the hostages going to get
released unharmed. The State
Department has now formed a
“working group” that is a "task"
force designed to deal exclusively
with the current situation. Susan
Pittman, a spokesman for the task
force said: “The paramount U.S.
concern right now is the release of
those people in the compound.”
When asked about. current
strategies, she said: “We are
pursuing every avenue.” Concern-
ing the use of the United Nations,
Pittman said: “We are interested
in studying the proposals within
the letter.”
had been contact with the PLO
about possible mediation she
replied: “We’ve been in contact
with a number of authorities.”
Pittman was asked if there had
been direct contact made with the
PLO by United. States authorities,
but declined tojuanswer, reiterating:
“We are concerned primarily with
the release of}; tho_§e hostages.

1' i.¢.'.

When asked if there,

C3 Tehran Distributed On: Campus

There’s been a’ violation of
international law.”

Pittman also commented on the
credibility of the letter that was
being distributed at Pitt. “There is
nothing we can assume but it
cannot be conﬁrmed,” Pittman

« said. The postscript on the letter

says: “I was not forced to write
anything I , have written here.
Just believe me.” The text of the
letter also voices a concern made
public by many Americans: “the
longer we stay here like this the
better chance there is for some-
thing terrible to happen.”

Dr. Manour Farhang, the Iranian
Ambassador to the U.S., is
concerned about the current
situation, Bani-Sadr has described
as “a prevailing state of war”.

Though the explanation of why
U.S.-Iranian relations have deter-
iorated is far from simple, there are
basic problems causing the current
crisis. One of the general feelings
among Iranians is that the shah is
not really sick and that Americans
are protecting him. Farhang
agreed that “many Iranians believe

this.” They believe the shah is
being protected so he can
eventually return to, power.

Hossein Ava explained the ration-
ale behind this feeling.

“We warned the U.S. not to _

accept the shah-in the country,”
’ (Continued on page 2)

After this beginning, the board
members believed they made many
accomplishments, both as a board
and personally. ~

The board members agreed that

one of the major accomplishments

of the year was cutting the SGB

budget by'$10,000. ' .
“When we cut $10.000 from last

year’s budget we helped lessen the

problem of limited funds,” board; _ ’

member Todd Park said. -

Each board member did work on 
- individual projects. "

The formation of the Academic
Affairs Committee and the campus
bus were on the top

issues of converting the campus

radio station, WPGH to open air 
FM and continuing the Food Cot-op." ‘ 
_ Galanski pointed out___that,,,ev‘en;' ‘
though some of these proposals 9' 
haven’t been finalized they are "as

“You may see next year’s board

“We started the process. There
is no more work we can do on it,
PAT has the next move,” Park
said.

The board members have learn-
ed their “bureaucratic lessons”

and want to pass them along to the

newly elected board. _.

’ “I’ve gained some valuable ties
with the administration,” Galanski
said. “I’ve learned more about
human behavior than anything
else. It's been a practicum of how
to get things done and a tool for
personal development. ’ ’

“Learning the tricks of the trade
 just as important,” Cindy De-
Matteo said. “You have to learn to
be a_politician. I know that’s a
dirty word, but it’s essential to get

‘ things done. You have to have 'a lot

of diplomacy and a lot of

‘ persistence." ’

Gianella and Park expressed
much, the same viewpoint.
Gianella advised the new board to
“stick with what you start with, in

“Stick to what you think is right.

“Also, you have to try not to be
overly sensitive.”

Another major warning to the
candidates is that they should do

several things that seem sus-

Ava said that there were other-

the major discrepancy is “with all

been five seconds of film on the’

suspicious that he is not even in the

Great American Smoke-Out Campaign

Terry Bradshaw's Use of Tob

By The Associated Press
I It’s not because Jo Jo Starbuck is
Pennsylvania chairwoman of
Thursday’s “Great American
Smoke-0ut” that she dislikes the
tobacco-chewing and cigar smoking
of her husband, Pittsburgh Steeler
quarterback Terry Bradshaw.
“Gross” is how Miss Starbuck
describes the tobacco-chewing.
“It’s something I can't handle,”
she said of the cigars. “But he
doesn’t do it around me.”
The three-time Super Bowl

- winning quarterback got hooked on

post.-game victory cigars by Steel-
ers owner Art Rooney, says his
wife, a two time Olympic skater.

“Terry knows I don’t like it. He
doesn’t do it at home though. Only
at meetings at the stadium. That's
been a big improvement.”

Although the couple apparently
has worked out a compromise on
Bradshaw's use of tobacco, Miss
Starbuck, 28, is heading up the
effort in the state to get others to
quit smoking.

As a non-smoker, she says she
doesn’t know firsthand what'it’s

like to quit. But Miss Starbuck,
four-year star of the Ice Capades,
forced her mother to kick the habit
by threatening to give up a
blossoming skating career at the
age of 18. ‘

“I couldn’t stand it all,” she said
in a recent interview with the
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. “I ‘said to
her, ‘Either you quit smoking, or I
quit skating.’

“I could see what it was doing to
her, particularly the nervous
pressure of skating competition.
She’d have a cigarette in both

hands. It was ruining her looks, her
heath and her breath as it does with
all smokers. Only they don’t want
to admit it. I think you have to get
tough with them.”

The state” chapter of the
American Cancer Society asked
Miss Starbuck to chair Pennsyl-
vania’s Smoke-Out this —year
because of her outspokenness
against smoking, a society spokes-
woman said. As a skater, Miss
Starbuck also has been active in
benefits for other cancer related

charities, said spokeswoman Caro- -
lyn Reuler.

“We also chose her as honorary
chairman because her name is
familiar to the public. We’re
especially anxious to reach young
smokers" and we felt she has great

“Also she’s an athlete and
athletes need the stamina that
smoking takes away. So she has a
natural tie-in with us,” Ms. Reuter
said.

Demonstrations Against Iran Continue Across U.S. .

By The Associated Press .
The 50,000 Iranian students in

the United States, told to report to
immigration officials or face depor-
tation, were the targets of more
demonstrations Tuesday across the
country.

Iranian flags intended to be
burned were selling like hotcakes

No Plans to

By The Associated Press

HARRISBURG Pennsylvania
Gov. Dick Thornburgh does not
foresee an immediate resumption
of mandatory fuelsaving measures
because of the cutoff of oil from
Iran.

“We have no plans as of this
moment to reimpose odd-even
gasoline rationing or any matters

for $13 each at a store across the
street from the Betsy Ross house in
Philadelphia.

“We Reserve the Right to
Refuse Service to Iranian Citi-
zens,” read a sign posted in front
of the First Edition restaurant and
disco in Oceanside, N.J.

About 200 persons chanting

“Drink your oil” watched as a
homemade Iranian ﬂag was burned ~

secretary, Paul Critchlow,
Monday night.

“We do intend to monitor the’

By The Associated Press

MISSISSAUGA, Ontario-—Most
of ._the deadly chlorine from a
wreckedrail tanker in this western
Toronto suburb had safely dissi-

pated into the atmosphere by

Tuesday. Many of the 220,000
persons evacuated began returning
home. But ofﬁcials said the danger
was not over.

Authorities said the 50,000
persons who live in a 30-square-
mile area around the wreck site
would have to spend a third night
away from home because of
continued danger of explosion and
subsequent spread of chlorine gas.

Soon after authorities gave
permission, some residents began
returning home. Most traveled in
their own car but some were given
lifts in transit buses, ambulances

. and the cars of Red Cross workers.

Workers attempting to seal

one of several wrecked in the
derailment Saturday night, said
about three-quarters of the 90 tons
of chlorine was gone.

City officials said until gas

gas into tanker trucks.

Attorney General Roy McMurty
told a news conference “a very
deﬁnite health hazard still exists
and we want to make that very
clear...we are optimistic that the

chlorine will be secured by tonight,

but unfortunately the chlorine is
not the only problem, there is a
significant problem with propane. ’ ’

McMurty was referring to a ﬁre A

near the chlorine carrier.

said

order gas rationing is still in effect.
“It is not a complicated thing,”

Critchlow said. “It can be put into

effect overnight if necessary.”

Thornburgh continues to stress
conservation, 1 Critchlow said.

“The governor and his staff have
been discussing the 4 issue. The
feeling right now is that we'll wait
and see how it goes,” he said.

 

Small anti-Iranian demonstra-
tions were staged in New York,
Grand Junction, Colo., Baltimore
and elsewhere as Attorney General
Benjamin Civiletti ordered all
Iranian students to report to
immigration officials within 30 days
to show that they are full-time
students as required by their visas.

A government official, who
asked not to be identified, said the
action was an attempt to forestall
any violence by Americans that
could threaten the lives of 60
hostages who have been held at the
U.S. Embassy in Tehran for the
past 10 days. 1

In Chicago, federal authorities
have taken three Iranians into
custody to await exclusion or
deportation hearings, authorities
said. William Skidmore, an

assistant deputy director for

deportation, refused to say whether
the incident was related,‘ to
President Carter's orders to begin
de'portation hearings for Iranian
students who are in the country
illegally. _

Meanwhile, four Iranian stu-1
dents jailed since Friday for
allegedly plotting to kidnap Minne-
sota Gov. Al Quie were released.
Ramsey County Attorney Tom’
Foley said that while there had
been good cause to arrest the four
Iranians from Mankato State
University, there was not sufficient
evidence to charge them.

At the University of Missouri in

Columbia, Mo., about 500 students ’
staged a demonstration that ended

in jeers, catcalls, shouting and d
chants aimed at Iranian students on_ .   .
campus. Two Iranians in the crowd-'
were surrounded and heckled, but

not harmed.

 “What I do about contraception is my business. After all, it's my life.

CM-BBT stands for Cervical Mucus and Basal Body Temperature-—two

CM-BBT at my Family Planning Center. The experts there were just the
kind of people I wanted to see. Professional. Knowledgeable. Straight-

Family Planning Centers offer‘ many contraceptive options, but con-

sidering my lifestyle and outlook, I decided on CM-BBT. This method

has been thoroughly researched, investigated and tested by scientists
and doctors. It is a procedure which I understand and feel cornfort- ‘

There's no medical risk involved—-and no crossed fingers.

Don't use CM-BBT without professional guidance. With the help
of my Family Planning Counselor, I learned how to detect,

has some basis in fact) in mind, they can start to
understand why some Iranians have gone to such
drastic lengths to see that the shah is brought to
justice in Iran. Appreciation of this view cannot help
"Americans condone the wrong done to the 60
hostages, but it can allow Americans to see that the
United States must be patient to gain a successful
outcome to the confrontation, since strong feelings
of hatred for the shah exist among Iranians.

Jr., Jacob J avits and Edward Kennedy, and George

“ Meariy, demonstrates that this action could help to

' ’ hold in check any push for more drastic action such
as military intervention.

If this move by the president helps to reduce
tensions in the United States over the conﬂict, Carter
should be better able to pursue the problem that.
should be his main concern—the release of the 60
Americans from the Tehran embassy. Unfortun-

I ately, American efforts in this area have become
mired in a swamp of uncertainity.

Until this weekend negotiators from the Palestine
Liberation Organization were the best hope for a
peaceful, settlement of the confrontation between
Iran and the United States, but those representatives
of the PLO have left Iran without gaining any
success. Since the failure of the Palestinians, there
has been no assertive steps by the United States to
re-establish contact. U.S. representatives enroute to
Iran were stopped in Istanbul, and Iranian attempts
to take the matter to-the United Nations have also
gone nowhere. Carter must act quickly to re-open
the stymied negotiations because every, day the
hostages remain in the embassy, the danger of some
mishap that could result in tragedy increases.

While national leaders [work toward the peaceful
solution of the crisis, Pitt studentsand everyone must
do their part by keeping calm about the situation.
Confrontation between Iranian and Aemricans at
Pitt or elsewhere can do nothing to solve the
problem. Americans must remind themselves
constantly of the Iranian view of the shah in order to
maintain a cool-headed perspective of the situation.
They must remember that the Iranian people see the
shah to be a tyrant as evil as Hitler and ‘to be the man
responsible for the torturing and killing of thousands
of Iranians.

If Americans keep this view of the‘ shah (one that

  
  

B Good First Move

, Acting with the proper mix of force and restraint,
. President Jimmy Carter yesterday suspended all oil
‘ imports from Iran in answer to Moslem students in
Tehran who are demanding the return of the shah
to Iran in exchange for 60 hostages held in the U.S.
embassy. In the face of continued failure of
negotiations over the past 10 days, Carter had no
 ‘choice but to assert strongly the American feeling
about the Iranian students’ demands, and show the
United States would rather do without Iranian oil
than surrender a sick and dying man to the Islamic
Republic of Iran. Such resolve can help convince the
Iranian government that it must .show more
flexibility in bargaining sessions, if they wish the
crisis to be solved successfully.

A more important effect of the suspension of oil
imports should be its inﬂuence on public opinion.
Emotional reactions to the seizure of the U.S.
embassy in Tehran have been strong, and many
Americans have been calling for someshow of force
by the U.S. governmen. The support Carter’s move

. _ . has received from a diverse group of national leaders,
 including Senator Frank Church, Howard Baker,

By Candidates

In the world of politics it is encouraging whenever
office seekers act to correct what they see as a wrong,
without considering what effect their step might have
on their chance to be elected. For this reason, Alan
Mele, Peter Germain and Peter M. Daloni must be
praised for their complaints against the Engineering
Student Cabinet. The three objectedto the cabinet’s
offer of $10010 the engineering department that had
the most students vote in this week’s Student-
Government Board elections. '

The three, who are candidates in the election, saw
the cabinet’s action as unethical, and a possible
violation of the Student Government election code,
so they filed a complaint with the Elections
Committee. When Mele, Germain and Daloni filed
the complaint, they were fully aware that their action
could turn the engineering students, a sizeable part of
the undergraduate population here, against them,"
but they still voiced their objections because they saw
the cabinet’s offer to be incorrect.

Such courageous behavior by the three should be
commended.

Letter .

We've been getting blitzed lately
by the Student Government Board
elections. There are signs every-
where telling you to vote for this
‘name or this face. In the Pitt News
interviews all of the candidates said
extremely similar things concern-
ing there programs. It amounts to
no choice at all. Why? Because it
excludes the student body from the
possibility of having any say in the
real policies of the University.
Whoever wins the election will be
the person who has made the right
alliances with the right groups
which will vote them in. The
majority of students don't have
much reason to even take interest
in the issues or outcomes of the
election because few real issues are
being addressed.

Recently, Pitt has been driving
out working class students by
raising tuition and other costs
every year. At the same. time,

services have gone down hill
because the staff is overworked.
This year. they received 4 % pay
raises despite an inflation rate ‘over
twice that. When one worker quits,
the University often shifts the load
to other employees instead of
hiring somebody. Think of this
when you're waiting in line at the
Ofﬁce of Student Aid and there are
only two women to take care of
students who've already waited for
fifteen minutes and have to leave
for class. Think of this when the
elevators break down and there is
no one to fix them. Think of this
when you hear about sauna baths
in the Student Union Renovation
Plan at the same time your
resources disappear from the
Reserve Book Room. Think of this
when you _see signs telling you to
vote for some name instead of
telling you to vote for a method of
dealing with these problems.

By JEFF DUROSKO
Pitt News Staff Writer
All season, everyone who knows
anyting about women’s volleyball
has been calling Pitt the number
one" team in the east. The
Pantherettes will get a chance to
prove themselves when the eastern

' regional championships _are held

here beginning tomorrow night.
Pitt opens at 7 p.m. against Rhode
Island.

« “Only one team from our region
goes to nationals and we want it
really badly,” said coach Mike
A “There’s also a pride

called number one.”

It’s been an up and down season
for the Pantherettes, as their
season to date stands at 27-18-3.
Last year’s team went 41-14 on the
season and placed 13th at
nationals. The reason for the many
losses is two-fold. First, Pitt has
been playing a much tougher

‘schedule this season and secondly,

they have been playing in-
lconsistently.

The season begin with a west
coast tour which, according to the
coach, was to strengthen the team
in all aspects of its game. However,
later in the season, Pitt was having
problems because of an emotional
down caused by the drop in the
level of competition.

During the west coast tour, Pitt
played volleyball powerhouses like
Southern California, UCLA, Hawaii
and San Diego State. And they
didn't -fare all that poorly. Pitt
defeated Brigham Young-Hawaii
once and also placed in a tie for
seventh at the San Diego Invita-
tional.

At that tournament, after losing
the first game in three consecutive
matches (to UCLA, Texas and
Fresno State), Pitt came back to
down each team in the second
game to record a tie. In a crucial
match, the Pantherettes met the
challenge of having to win by
downing Arizona.

Pitt then came back home to host
the Pitt Invitational and roared to a
convincing ﬁrst-place ﬁnish. It was
after this tournament that most of
the talk about being number one in
the east began.

Their next major victory came
the next week by winning the
Cincinnati Invitational which gave
the Pantherettes a full head of
steam going into the tough
Houston Invitational. At Houston,
Pitt could do no better than seventh
place.

It was at this point in the season '

that Pitt began its downfall of sorts.
The next major tournament was
Pitt’s own Classic where the

Pantherettes downed a strong team

from Ottawa, but couldn’t handle

' Ohio State. Hebert cited the many

mistakes by Pitt as the reason for
the loss. This was to be the tone
over the -next few weeks—mis-
takes. ' 2

Pitt placed fourth at the
Maryland Invitational against
many of the same teams they will
face this weekend, but got that one
right back, defeating the Lady
Terps the next weekend at Ohio
State. _ I

By far the most disappointing
loss of the season was handed to
Pitt just last week as Penn State
easily downed the spikers 15-5,
15-7, 15-4. .

“I lost count of the mistakes we
made,” Hebert said, following the
match. “We just got clobbered.”

According to the coach, the
Pantherettes have to rid them-
selves of those mistakes or they
won’t come close to winning the
regionals. That same Penn State

and Rutgers (third).

:‘We justhave to play well,’_’
said Hebert. “It won’t be as easy
as last year as Penn State,
Maryland and Rutgers really
improved over the season. They’re
all much more competitive.”

To win the tournament, the
Pantherettes are going to have to
improve in their blocking, accord-
ing to the coach. He said Pitt is a
hard hitting team and when
another team is blocking well, it
can force the spikers to lose their
composure. He added that Pitt has
been working on preventing this in
the last few weeks.

“To get around this problem in
blocking,” said Hebert, “we have

Pantherette Tracksters Need First-A id for Budget Cuts

By RANDY BAILEY

Pitt News Staff Writer

With the start of the indoor track_

season forthcoming, November is usually
a. time of optimism. This season,
however, the outlook is somewhat
dimmed for the Pitt women’s team.

First of all, the Pantherette cross
country team was disbanded. It was
reduced to the club level because of
budget cuts and this left Pitt women
distance ru'nners with only a few local
road races to compete in. Running as an
individual and paying your own way is
hardly conducive towards building team
spirit.

Head coach Alfreeda Goff, running the
show without a distance coach this year
because of budget cuts, “doesn’t
questionthat the money isn't there,” but
feels that “things could have been
handled better.” ‘

In a year where all non-revenue sports
were supposedly forced to take budget
cuts, one would have to question whether
the women’s basketball team has not
expanded its program. Not to mention

A the volleyball team which toured the
’ 1 West and Hawaii earlier this season.‘

Goff stated that she “can’t see why any
sports had to be cut, especially cross
country and men’s water polo.” She also
noted that the token presence of the
men’s cross country team “would have
been cut completely had it not been for a
technicality involving the basketball
teams’ association with the Eastern
Eight.” This commitment requires
participation from all eight schools in its
league championships.

The question is: why were these
inexpensive sports cut from the athletic
program when their budget'could be
covered in the cost to paint the football
ﬁeld? The problem here goes back to the
long-standing debate over revenue versus
non revenue sports. A

Many observers believe the proﬁts
from revenue sports such as football
should be used to fund all athletic
program. While supporters of revenue
sports feel they alone should determine
where their proﬁts should be used, there
is little doubt that these inexpensive
sports could be saved by removing some
of the unnecessary frills.

An example of this is the scholarship
situation at Pitt. The football team has 95

scholarship athletes, the NCAA limit.
Many of these players will never _see
action in a game. Meanwhile, Goff was
not able to give out one new scholarship
this year, the budget couldn’t support it.

Recently, the Pitt football team earned
$200,000 for the TV rights to its game
against Syracuse. The team most cer-
tainly deserved this money, although it
doesn't seem unreasonable to share this
windfall. If only 10% of those proﬁts
were. given to non revenue programs, the
three sports that were sacriﬁced by the
Athletic Department this season could
easily be revived.

Unfortunately, the problems are just
beginning, for one of those teams,
women’s track. Due to still more budget
cuts, only a maximum of 18 women can be
carried on this p year’s stripped-down
edition of the team.

0

The Pantherettes ﬁnished a strong
third out of 68 teams at the Eastern
outdoor championships a year ago.
Coach Alfreeda Goff, however, said,
“there is no way we will reach that this
year.” '

Although Pitt no longer competes in

dual meets, several members of the track
team and Goff said they feel 18
individuals are not sufficient for a major
university track team. Thus, Goff is
requiring all members of this year’s team
to be able to compete in at least two

events. While two events may not soundg,

like. such a burden, keep in mind that the
Pantherettes will only compete in large
meets this season where time trials, semi
ﬁnals and ﬁnals in each event make for a
lot of races.

Although the team does have some

outstanding individuals (sprinter Gwen ‘A

Murray has competed internationally),
there is a marked lack of depth.

Matters were made worse when several
key members of last year’s team didn't
try out this season or transferred to other
schools. “Also,” said Goff, “several
recruits were lost because we have no
cross country program.”

‘.
Although Goff said she (felt optimistic",

about her ‘girls individually, she
admitted, “We feel we will not be
successful as,a team. To me, this year is
like starting over.” '_

SHOWCASE on

’Fish’ Kicked Off By Celebrity
,BoatrideFor Charity

By IVIARIA SCIUEII.-O

At one end of the room, four or five tall
black men; dressed to various» degrees of
formal attire, talked quietly. giving out an
occasional hug or lriss to the ladies and

s’3*pausing every now and then to smile and
have their picture taken.

On the far side of the area, young
ladies and men cheerfully handed out
‘ glasses‘of champagne, 45 rpm records
and perfume samples to the multitude of.
people stepping-off the gangplank and
strolling onto the Gateway Party Liner.

Later on, in the center stage portion of

4 the crowded room, a fashion show was in

progress, the -likes of which caused more

than one guest in attendance to look up

_from her hot buffet plate and sigh,’ ‘‘I’.ve

' just got to stop eating so much...will you
look at those modelsl”

clothes and 1980 winter collections, the
focus of attention was clearly directed to
the film’s stars in attendance. ' In par-
ticular, Julius “Dr. J” Erving of the
Philadelphia 76ers, Harlem Globetrotter
veteran Meadowlark Lemon and 13-year-
old James Bond III, who didn't look old
enough to be staying up so late, stood
out. - 

. Erving, who _is realistically cast as a
professional basketball bonus baby in
“Fish,” said he enjoyed the weeks of
ﬁlming on location, and noted that the
city has changed since he was last here.
“I found Pittsburgh has changed
considerably since the early 70’s, when I

Since the formation of the band more
than a year ago, Tumblin Dice has been
winning over audiences with overpower-
ing, professional style rock’n’roll. While
they can duplicate famous bands to atee,
their originals“ contain the ingredient
rock’n’roll is all abo11t—energy. .

The band’s roots spi'6ii‘ted_\years ago
when Gary I-Ioohman, lead vocalist and
guitarist, and Bryan Bassett got together
with the idea of forming a-band. They had
differences ‘ on exactly what to do,
however, and Bassett left to tour with
Wild Cherry. Bassett, whose career in
music is about nine years old, appeared
with Wild Cherry on such shows as “Don
Kirsher’s Rock Concert” and “The Mike
Douglas Show.” ‘ ‘

Meanwhi1e,' Hohmuan played with
bands like Road Apple and Hollywood.

Years past, and the two eventually got‘ V

back together with plans of forming a new
band and started recruiting musicians.
This time around something clicked.
They met bass player Jeff Jimmerson
who already knew George Marcinko and
Jack Morzowski from local bands like

You.” Although Hohman and Bassett

write most of the songs,» the rest of the’.

band is currently developing their writing
to produce a’ more diversiﬁed and well
rounded rock style. This is . very
important for having a distinct sound.

Tumblin Dice have played frequently at
Mancini’s, the Evergreen Hotel and can
be found most likely at The Decade. The
band has spread out through performing
at two of the Agora clubs, the Palace
Theater with Jay Ferguson, and recently
the Stanley Theatre with Pittsburgh’s
own David Werner. ‘Tumblin Dice
would like to play for younger crowds,

which is a problem with Pittsburgh._

There is no place for teenagers to see
local groups since’ one must be over

such place to go was the Grove, closing
nearly five years ago. '

The future for Tumblin ‘Dice is
favorable ‘and definitely a lot to look

encouraging and exciting. The band has
plans to travel t6 Massachusetts in the

Studio 54 To Heaven

By DAVID E. STUBBS

Over the past few years the
American music scene has been
invaded by what has been i I ,
commonly known as the disco I
craze. Disco music is dance music.
It is usually fast and monorhythmic
and, unless yoir’re dancing to it,
quite monotonous. A lot of people
thinkthat disco music and discos
are the same thing. They aren_’t. A
disco is simply any place which one

-can dance to contemporary dance
music. The main reason that these
places are called discos is because
the popularity of disco music made
popular dancing big money again.

Nowhere is the difference

between disco music and a disco
more evident than in Pittsburgh;

. The true disco craze never really ’
did catch on in this city. Disco a
music is usually" synonomous with '
hustling and other related forms of
organized fast dancing. These
forms of dancing, however, are
rarely seen in Pittsburgh. The
dancers in Pittsburgh do the
funkier, free-style dances which
call for a different kind of music.

Rather than dance to traditional
disco artists like Gino Soccio or the
Village People, Pittsbu_rgh_dancers
prefer funk like the music _of Slave,
Cameo, Parliament or Pleasure.
Pittsburgh’s preference of dance
style has a lot of influence on the

kind of discos the city has.

‘ The majority of Pittsburgh’s
discos are known as ‘ ‘bar sets. ”

Barsets mean the place is ,_ -  I

4

primarily a bar with a dance ﬂoor.
The Electric Banana, Crossroads‘,
The Inferno and The Sanctuary are
prime examples of popular
Pittsburgh barset discos. These
places are usually a bit small and .
get crowded very easily. You can
have a good time in them, however,
' if you have the proper attitude and

don’t expect too much. The most
popular Pittsburgh discos, I
Reﬂections and the 2001, are
primarily bar set discos but they
arelarger than average and their
convenient locations accounts for
most of their success. 2001 is on
the North Side and Reﬂections is
located in Market Square.

V Allin all; Pittsburgh is not what. i

would be considered a major disco
town. Besidesnot being a major
marketplace for the music,
Pittsburgh doesn’t have the big
elaborate kinds of discos. Studio 54
in New York and J ason’s in Boston
are examples of this kind of place.
Opening soon, Heaven will

attempt to bring Pittsburgh into the

total disco experience. Heaven will -

be located in the former lobby of
-the Fulton building on 6th Street. It
will exhibit the ultimate in modern
architecture and design done by R.

Scott Bromley and Robin J acobsen.

Bromley and Jacobsen use'a sleek
approach to modern design. They
are best known for their designing
of Girards in Baltimore and Studio
54.
Heaven will open Pittsburgh’s

nose ‘wide with such features as a o

 

move on to even better events. Their
bouldérish, heart-pounding ’ rock’n’roll
and the vibrating glow of the, band shows , _
that rock is here to stay, especially in » '1

The music that Pittsburgh
audiences love could receive the
same reaction in Boston, T
Portland, L.A. and all the towns
in between. That’s the idea
behind records and tours. But
how does a band or musician go

“ from packing ‘cm into their
town’s clubs to national or
international “star status?”’

Very slowly. And there are as
many combinations of achieving
this goal as there are musicians
that made it. But back at the
beginning, one of the traditional
“first steps” has been to make a
 demo, or demonstration tape.

The demo is the musician’s
calling card to the outside world,
V i.e. record companies. It
guarantees a consistent
performance and sound that one
' cannot expect to duplicate in
various clubs, in every
‘performance. '

I

The demo should try to
' express, as close as possible, what

the musicians involved are all
about, and as such, the steps in .
the completion of a demo are
frought with attention.

First, the musicians have to
decide when they’re ready to do
it. Then they must determine
who they want to play with,
where they want to record, and
what music should be used on the
demo.

Once these things have been
decided the more artistic part of
the process begins. Each
musician records his part until it
sounds right. When there is more
than one musician involved in a
recording, there are many
opinions as to what “sounds

and so on. This must be done for
each song, sometimes starting all’
over from scratch. It’s an almost
endless series of listening,
stopping, making changes, and
repeating the process until the
final mix is done, and everyone
involved is satisfied with the end .
result.

This is a highly simplistic ‘ '
overview of what it takes to make
a demo, or any recording of this
nature. It is impossible to relay
the_ time, energy and dedication
to scrupulous detail involved in
the undertaking. If one has seen

’ the concentration and absorption

 
 

addition, the first decisions as to
‘studio, musicians and music may
also have to change.

So, maybe a couple of months
after the first studio session, the ’
taping is finally done. Then the
chore of listening to what has
been recorded begins. ‘This
means listening to perhaps
sixteen separate tracks with one
or more instrument on each,‘ i
cleaning up the sound, making
additions and subtractions,
listening to various mixes, _
deciding what to emphasize or "
diminish, how to fade a song out,

of nurses hovering over the
monitors and dials in an 
unit, it is no exaggeration to say
that it is the same look on the
faces of the sound engineers‘ and
musicians over the mixing board.

What does a demo mean in the
career ofa musician? What ‘
effect does it have‘? A large ,
number of musicians view._it as a
means to securing a record deal,
which is a very optimistic view
even if one doesn’t considerthe
effect the _recession is having on

/ thérecord industry.

Three members of the
disbanded group, "‘Takin’ _
Names,” Eric Leeds, Howard .
Bennett, and Mat Blistan—have
been in John Grill’s studio in

_ Shadyside since mid-April

putting together a demo of four
songs, three of which are original _
compositions.

“What we want out of this is
the experience of recording our
music, and essentially getting
feedback on what we’re doing.
We’re not looking for any record
deal out of this. That would be
nice, but we didn’t go into this
with that in mind,” said
drummer Bennet of the demo.

“It’s all part of getting to play
the music you want to play. You
just have to do it. I’m fortunate
enough to be in a band that I‘
enjoy playing with aside from
what I’m doing here (He is‘ a
member of Billy Price and the .
Keystone Rhythm Band)’. Not
very many musicians have that,”
added Leeds.

Whatever happens with a

musician’s demo can’t be
planned, but making one is—a
necessary part of his or her
schooling. , There are no
universities or musicians’ guides
to»“making it,” that do thejob.
One has,'at the very least, the
experience of recording a.final
product that the individual has
control over,, being satisfied with
the end product, and developing
an enormous amount of patience.
This could be the most valuable
trait a-musician could develop,
for as the writer Joseph Conrad
wrote,/“Art is long, life is short,
aridgsuccessv is very far away. ”

thing that he truly wants to do--run. So,
on this day he decides he is going to run
in the qualifying race for the Olympics,
for ;the second time, only this time he

Here we have it--a story of a man who

It’s also a renewed sense of self. It’s also
a story as. original as the previous
statement." “Running” has_ everything
you’ve‘ ever seen before with (almost)
everything you’d expect to happen. Not
only doesit lack originality,but it smacks
of pure banality.

What does this mean? Well, if you’ve
seen “Rocky” you’ll know that producers
Robert Cooper and Ronald Cohen did too.
In the ﬁrst scene, as Michael prepares for

room dwelling, one could almost envision
S. Stallone craking an egg into his O.J.
However, Andropolis does drink his
straight.

For varying reasons, both Rocky’s
coach and Andropolis’ coach were
decidedly fault-ﬁnding and pessimistic.

.,Perhaps the producers felt this would

build audience sympathy for this 

underdog hero--and that's, not all.

- Remember all those running scenes in
“Rocky,” vibrating with triumphant
crescendoes? Yes, those are here too. It
must be added, however, that they were
not overdone. Finally, along the same

‘Storbl leads him down a pair of
steps to center stage. Although
they try to hold back, the other
actors on the set begin to laugh
uncontrollably. After regaining
their composure, the actors return

posing for can finally be shot.

A This clowning around comes at
the endof a long day of rehearsals
at Theatre Express. The company,
formed four years ago by a group of
Carnegie-Mellon graduates, is in
the ﬁnal stages of preparation for
its upcoming fourth season.

After last year’s ‘successful
premiere season in its permanent
space at the old Plaza Rubber
Building on Baum Boulevard,
Theatre Express seems destined,
and is very determined, to have all
heads turn its way and nod
approval: An impressive publicity/
subscription blitz this fall, coupled
with the selection of ﬁve intriguing
plays, will undoubtedly establish
Theatre Express as the city’s most

V valuable alternative theatre
company. At the end of the season
only non-patrons will remain
unconvinced of this company’s
constructive diversity and
professionalism.

The season premiere on
November 29 with Arnold

the early '60s, “Dynamite

An Enjoyable Evening Of 'HMs Pinafore’ At Heinz Hall

By SCOTT MOWRY

A ‘variety of colorful splendor, lively
music and light-hearted humor high-
lighted the rendition of Gilbert and
“H.M.S. Pinafore”, last
Tuesday night at Heinz Hall.

Although inconsistent in their perfor-
mance, The Glorianna Productions
Company from New York City managed
to delight and charm their way through
one_of the most popular of the Gilbert and
Sullivan operettas. After an initially
confusing opening, the Glorianna group
gathered steady momentum —to leave

, behind a feeling of engaging and

entertaining fulﬁllment for this one and
only performance in Pittsburgh.

As with any successful ‘opera, this
“Pinafore” production appearedlto work
best when the musically strong singers
took the spotlight. Speciﬁcally, the voices
of Sara-Ann Noll in the role of Josephine
and Jocelyn Wilkes as Little Buttercup
were resiliantly clear in their delivery and
stage personality. Wilkes especially,
combined a magnetic presence and
turned in an inspiring presentation of the
rotund and large-hearted Little Butter-
cup. .,

At times, however, this production
tended to be overdone, relying too heavily
upon the silly antics of John Carle as the
eccentric, First Lord of the Admiralty, Sir
Joseph Porter. Without question, Carle
displayed a great deal of comedic ability

. and provided some of the more hilarious

interludes of the evening. B_ut like too
much of a good thing, the actions of‘ Sir
Joseph Porter were permitted to
overshadow the music, the plot and fellow
characters—most clearly apparent during
“Bell Trio” from the “Never, Mind the

act.” Featured will be the
premiere of a new two-piano score
adapted by Michael Roth for
Balcom and Theatre Express.

Jed Harris along with general
manager Caren Harder and music
director William Tumer-are the
only remaining members of the
original Theater Express company.
‘ ‘Dynamite Tonight’ ’ will be
Harris’ only acting appearance of
the season. The remainder "of his
time will be devoted to directing
T.E. ’s third and ﬁfth productions;
Samuel Beckett's ‘ ‘Endgame” and
Rainer Werner Fassbinder’s
“Preparadise, Sorry Now”

of the New York theatre scene.
With the exception of Zahn,.all
the newcomers to Theatre Express

are also newcomers to Pittsburgh.
‘ ‘It's a very scenic, lovely

place,” said Matthey. “I’m very \
happy to be with Theatre Express,
it's a very ambitious company with
capable, sensible people.” A
Perhaps the two most important
productions at Theatre Express this
year will be ‘ ‘Stage Blood’ ’ and
“Made By Two.” “Stage_Blood”
is important because it is the ﬁrst
_time any‘ company has been
granted performance rights to a
work written by "Charles Ludlam.
Harder explained that because of"
Ludlam’s strong reception by
Pittsburghers (‘ ‘Camille’ ’ and

wonders. _
Another difficulty; that hindered the

Glorianna cast was perhaps due to ‘the '

unfamiliarity with the acoustics, sur-
roundings and audience of Heinz Hall.
Consequently. the movement of the action
did not ﬂow as smoothly as it could have
given the uptempo mood of Gilbert
Sullivan’s script and song writing. .

Yet despite the ﬂaws, this production
was a joyous event, ﬁlled with some of the
most compelling aspects that remain so
rewarding in opera. Indeed, each
member of 24-person cast seemed to have
their moments’ of inspiration.

Roger Andrews as Captain Corcoraln
handled his baritone parts with a mix of
aplomb and good nature. And James
Wison playing Ralph Backstraw, al-
though a less than commanding
performer than his major role required,
displayed a melodic tenor that often rose.
above the chorus.

Perhaps the dark horse nomination of
the evening belonged ' to Richard
Crickenberger in the supporting role of
Bob Becket, whose deep bass was always
vibrant and endearing.

Most of the outstanding songs occurred
near-the end of Act I which included,
“For I Hold That on the Seas”. “A
British Tar,” “Refrain, Audacious Tar”
and “Can I Survive This Overbearing?".
The orchestration under conductor Robert

Lindstrom remained competant but not

Fine Line Theater Company 
we Fails inFeiffer’s ’Hold Me’

0
Directed by Robert Koch
Fine Line Theater Company

By JANICE SCHULER

This production has serious problems,
not the least of which is acting. It is low
budget, community theater and looks it.
But if you are a_ compulsive theater goer,
intent on going out on a Friday or
Saturday night, then it will be easy for
you to benignly neglect these major ﬂaws
in The Fine Line Theater Company’s
production of Jules Feiffer’s “Hold Me.”

Feiffer wrote a potentially funny and
enlightening series of vignettes, ‘sketches
and skits concerned with the abundance
of ironies inherent in Urbania, but the
actors lack the professional savvy and
conviction to pull it off. There are
exceptions; Anna Herbert was almost
always good, portraying among other
characters, a wife who can only fall in love
with her husband when he's away on a

. business trip and a frustrated party

addict. Robert Koch (who is also the
director. of this production) plays a_very
endearing schmuck. a father who tells his
ﬁve years old son that their relationship

- isn’t.working out, that he prefers the

company of adults, and a‘ma'n who is
pleasantly afflicted with the curse of Fred
Astaire. ' I '

- so well

Probably most of us are familiar with.
Feiffer’s’ cartoon character of the_dancer,
who celebrates the profound"and the
trivial, the 70’s, the 60’s, the 50’s,
summer, getting a tan, and turning over.
This character is used in “Hold Me” to
break up the sketches, but what worked
on‘ paper, with Feiffer’s
idiosyncratic rendering of the frazzled

‘ ~haired, big-nosed nurdly dancer, does not

translate well on the stage. And what's’
worse, it fails miserable in this
production. This has nothing to do with
Roberta Thompson’s talent as a dancer.

but proves that she is not an actress and l

is definitely the wrong performer for what
could at least have been some-charming
interludes.

Despite t_he selfconsciousness of the
actors. the low budget of the production,

'_the tacky painting on the back wall of the

set. there are sporadic moments of
preciuos comedy in this production of
“Hold Me.” Feiffer’s material has
enough strength that it withstands the
distractions that the wrong cast brings to
it. Feiffer’s message is loud and clear:

being human is chronically comic and.

loveably, silly. H
“Hold Me" runs Friday and Saturday

through November 24 at the LionlWalk._ A

Bonnie Raitt Moves Sria Iviosque VVIth Rocking Birthday Show

By MARGERY MEYERS

Bonnie Raitt
Syria Mosque
November 6, 1979

It has been said, that a greater number
of women in rock’n’roll are seen smiling,
partying, and having bad love affairs in
the public eye, one woman can be found
at home, doing her scales and exercises.
That woman is Bonnie Raitt, a true
virtuoso of guitar, and perhaps the finest
proof that women can pull off tough
rocking as well or better than their male
colleagues.

Raitt left her scales and exercises at
home, however, to make an audience in

Pittsburgh verv happy. Despite technical

problems onstage and a bland warm-up
act that relied on theatrics, she gave a
cheerful and somewhat unpredictable
performance._

A nice, tight rendition of “I Thank

You” was evidence that Raitt’s voice is -

stronger and cleaner than it ever was, and
that she could wail with the best. But

_ when she switched guitars and put on her

bottle-neck for “Three Time Loser,” the
magic was. sealed. ' Her style'is highly
polished. yet raw enough to add interest

‘and _set her apart from her blues

contemporaries.

Billy Joel

- Civic Arena

November 9, 1919 V 

Billy Joel, on the strength of his sheer
musical ability, showmanship, and
compositional talents, provided 2 hours of
first rate rock’n’ roll to a sellout crowd at
the Civic Arena last Friday night, in the
second of his two Pittsburgh shows.

From the first note to the last, Joel was
in command of the crowd, cranking out
one hit after another. He opened with the
lively, “Only the ,_Good Die Young,”
followed by “Movin’ Out,” which he
dedicated to the Pirates. Joelslowed
things down brieﬂy with the lyrical ballad
“Honesty,” before picking the tempo up

Perhaps the quietest moment at the
concert was when Raitt sang the title-cut
from her new, album, “The Glow.” She
has a remarkable ability to go from one
musical format into another without
sounding pretentious. Aside from a
shining display of her vocal range, there

sexually alluring as her album cover and
her detached, tough-girl stance indicated.

When she arrived onstage, escorted by '

four even rougher-looking musicians
whom proceeded to pound some very

again with the deﬁant “My Life.” He
continued into the familiar harmonica
lead-in of his. autobiographical _-“Piano
Man',” still one of Joel’s‘ greatest hits,
that got parts of the crowd on their feet.

Joel kept up the pace with ‘‘All for
Layna,” one of three new songs he
performed, which is slated to appear_on
his next album, due for release in early
‘February. “Layna” is a hard rocking
piece punctuated with staccato vocals that
rush together with a thumping beat,
similar to g the Cars “Just What I
Needed.” “Sometimes A Fantasy,” the
best new song, showed Joel’s increasing‘

 orientation to harder frock, highlighted by

a brief, but stinging guitar solo by David

_Brown, and Joel himself, jumpingand

grinding behind the electricorgan. “You,
May Be Right” brought Joel to the front

edge of the stage, twirling the mike

stand, and acting out the song in

near-manic mimes, driven by the deep

rifts of Doug Stegmeyer on Fender bass

guitar.

Joel’s music is_ founded on incisive
lyrics. throbbing rhythms, and polished
tones. but the cornerstone of his perfor-
mance was his straight-forward, no frills
ability to just play" the piano. He
complemented this_ with his on-stage
dynamisms, acting out and emphasizing
key lyrics in songs with his gestures, and
improvised clowning around. Joel said he
felt like an arena usher in his red jacket,
and even paused to ask fans near the
stage for their tickets. While Joel’s antics
add excitement to the concert, he always
relies . on ‘his’ music, ultimately, to
entertain. ’ ‘ .

further enhanced. - 

But beneath the sensuously cool
exterior, there seemed a vulnerable,
sensitive woman whose delicate, piercing
eyes apeared to reach every male in the
packed and sweaty Decade lounge.

_ Benatar opened her set with “If You
Think You Know How to.Love Me” that
immediately established an evening of
high pitched, rock ’n’ roll fury. Slide and
lead guitarist Neil “Spider” Geraldo was
the orch-estrator who: whipped the
Benatar hand through similar female
macho numbers like “I Need a Lover,”
“In the Heat of the Night,” “No You
Don’t” and “Heartbreaker,” the single
from the debute album which Benatar
introduced as, “you know what it isl”

and Myron Grombacher on drums laid

 

Throughout the night, songs featuring

Joel’s piano playing elicited the biggest,‘

response from the crowd. In the rapid
intro of “Angry Young Man,” as he
crouched over the keyboards, his hands a
frenzied blur. Joel showed his virtuosity
for an intricacy of rhythms. Next, a
snappy country rock instrumental had the
audience clapping their hands, and some

dancing in the aisles to the lightning

pianowork.

Joel also showed his versatility as a .

composer and singer with soft rocking
ballads like “Just the Way You Are”. and
“She’s Always a Woman to Me." Songs
like “Stiletto,” and “Zanzibar” showed
Joel’s expert use of rhythm and Latin
influences on his music. He put on dark
glasses, and lit a cigarette, stylin’ across
the stage and back to his piano, before

settling into “New York State of Mind,” a ‘

cool blues ballad highlighted by a jazzy
sax solo by Richie Cannata.» .

In honor of her thirtieth birthday, the I

audience gave Raitt flowers and a
birthday cake and they had a turn tofsing
“Happy Birthday.” Another aspect of the
concert which seemed to touch Raitt was
a nice show of anti-nuke banners. Most
of her between-song patter dealt with that ’
issue.-

The only disappointment of the concert"
was that she did not sing “Love Me Like

' These were the elements of Bill “Honky .
' Tonk” Doggett’s recent week-long

engagement at the Encore ll downtown.

“The music was spirited and fresh, yet
‘ ‘aged, like a good wine, with the expertise

and experience of time.
Doggett’s experience comes from over

‘four decades of recording and perform- ‘

O ing. He has played with some of the best
in jazz, including: Louis Armstrong,
Lionel Hampton, Count Basie, Louis
Jordan, Billie Holliday, Ella Fitzgerald,
‘Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker, Thalon-
.ious Monk and Bill Kenny and the Ink

completes the group with a strong, rich
voice that is as pleasant to the eat as
Williams herself is to the eye.

Doggett, a native of Philadephia, has
been coming to Pittsburgh on-and-off for
20 years. This was his ﬁrst appearance at

' . the Encore II (he played the Encore in
;_ 5 Shadyside

six years ago) and he
described it ‘as a “great room.” Because
of the diversiﬁed clientele, Doggett said

from night to night and stick mainly to

middle-of-the-road material.
‘ ‘We try not to overplay the public, else

you end up in the gutter,” Doggett said '

with a full smile. ,

The one song that‘ does get played
every night, however, is “Honky Tonk,”‘
Doggett’s biggest hit /from 1956. Doggett
played this tune several times during the
evening, punctuating the apparent
ending with a gravely “one more time”
before launching back into the refrain.

Throughout the evening, Doggett
declined from taking any extended solos.
Instead, musical solos were taken by
either Brooks or Moody. The bass riffs of
Moody, at least on closing night, fared
much better than Brook's sax.

A young man, Moody almost resembles
Stanley Clark as his ﬁngers quickly
moved up and down the neck and all over

the frets of his bass. At one point, he left
the stage and soloed feverishly in front of
the tables.

The evening’s spotlight, however,
seemed to shine brightest on Williams.

. Her voice was clean and dynamic, as she

moved around the small stage with the
ﬂair and conﬁdence of a professional.
Especially good ‘was “Teach Me
Tonight,” “Bitter Earth” and “Kansas
City.” Undoubtedly the best number of
the evening though was the classic “Send
In The Clowns” which Williams’ sang
twice; both times to perfection.

' Doggett and his bandrwill continue to
tour the U.S. untilspring. They will then
leave for Europe, playing around France
from April 20 through May 11.

Adam’ Makowicz has the unobtrusive
manner of any other jazz pianist. But once
he starts playing, he immediately steps
into a class all his own—or maybe one
shared by Art Tatum, Errol Garner or
Oscar Peterson.

A native of Poland, Makowicz is ~ a
recent ﬁgure on the‘American jazz scene.
His playing style and technique are
derived from both classical European and
American jazz inﬂuences. .

As solo performer at the Encore, 11
Wednesday through Saturday, Nov. 7-10,
he gave the audience a truly virtuoso
performance. His lightning‘-like changes
in "tempo and key and Garner-like

. but‘ soon he will be.

Adam Makowicz

strumming of chords brought new life to
seldom heard 30’s ballads, “My Silent

‘I.ove,” “Out of Nowhere.” His “over the

Rainbow” is easy, laid-back with an
undercurrent of blues. I I,

Makowicz’Vs own “Once Yes, Once No”
has so many variations of diverse styles
that comparisons to other ‘jazz pianists
simply cannot be made. His “Tribute to
Errol Garner” exhibits many of the‘ late
musician’s trademarks, but again, is pure
Makowicz. ,

Makowicz is not a familiar ﬁgure here,
Andthe idea of a
Polish jazz pianist ‘ does raise some
skepticism and a bit of‘ mirth, but
catching one of Makowicz’s performances

On stage, Joseph DeStio and James
Lieb play the central figures of Dr. Martin
Dysart and. Alan Strang respectively.
Strang is brought to Dysart by Hester
Saloman (Barbara Whitney) for analysis
after the boy is found to have blinded ﬁve
horses at a local riding stable.

In the process of discerning why Strang-'

attacked the animals he was so fondof,
Dysart is forced to come to terms with
some questions about himself and his
profession. In the end, Strang’s violent,
twisted passion becomes Dysart’s tor-
ment and obsession. ,

DeStio does an admirable job with the
role that was first played on Broadway by
Richard Burton. Lieb, however, comes
off better as the boy. He is totally
convincing as .the crazed youth.

always self-assured and appeared effort-
less, allowing her character to shine
through. Swanhilda is a beautiful woman

Mummenschanz
Heinz Hall
November 10, 1979

“Murnmenschanz” proved that the
imagination of children is less inhibited
than that of adults, but that even adults
can be sparked back into that magical
state of mind. There were_many children
in attendance Saturday night at Heinz
Hall and their presence was felt strongest

when their delighted laughter ﬁlled the _

dark theatre and the silence of the Swiss
mime act. .

The performance consisted of 20
separate skits which lasted from 2 to 5
minutes each. The ﬁrst 8 were ‘object’ or
‘creature’ skits. Best ' was _a silver
Slinky-like creature which tossed out to
the audience a bright orange balloon then
proceeded to" play catch, as people
bounced it back onstage.

Animals were represented in the
remaining.11 skits. of‘ the first act. Of
these, a frog, a ﬂy and a monkey were

‘ best. .

At intermission, one member of the
company delighted patrons‘ in the Grand
Lobby. He was dressed completely in
black, with a black-box head that was
ﬁxed with‘ different ‘coloured threads of
yarn. The man invited wide-eyed
children to arrange eyes and mouth with
the yarn on the Velcro surface‘ of his
‘face.’ ‘Meanwhile, another member of
the company ‘ entertained patrons who
remained in their seats. Also dressed in
black and black-box head, this ﬁgure had
the audience decorate her with pieces of
masking tape.

The second act consisted of nine skits,

depicted onaseries of tear-off note pads. ' ‘

each with two or three members of the
company. (Mark Olsen, Mark Thompson
and Claudia Weiss.) The ﬁgures were all
human-like, most with a variation on the
black-box head.‘ Best among these were
ﬁgures with eyes, nose, mouth and ears
represented by spools of toilet paper and
also , ﬁgures with eyes and mouth
expression represented by a series of
tear-off note pads.

The final skit, with Olsen and
Thompson, was perhaps the best of the
evening. ' The heads of these ﬁgures were
made of play-do-like substance which the

two continually remolded in a battle of
vanity. ’ '
Although all the skits had a playful
nature, loved by the children and
warmed-up to by adults, “Mummen-
schanz” has it’s serious side also. The
production has a sort of genesis to it; the

creatures and animals of the first act n

evolving into the various ‘human
characteristics of the second act. The
kids probably missed this aspect, but
then again, in their rediscovered
playfulness, maybemany of the adults
did too. It was a beautiful .evenin“g. .

In dealing with‘ everyday confronta-

Bertolucci (“Last Tango in Paris”), has

her concerns and involvement with him
are at a minimum due to her career and
their new life in Italy. '

Joey starts on a two-ﬁx-a-day heroine

constructs slightly out-of-context analo-

her son's birthday party and calling -for “a '

Tusk

,, Fleetwood Mac

Warner Bros. \

After a lengthy drought;
Fleetwood Mac has ﬁnally come
out with their long awaited
“Tusk.” It is a substantial letdown
to those of us who have been '

- , anxiously awaiting this release.

Although the album itself gives
special thanks to Lindsey Bucking-
ham, it is difficult to say who has
been the moving force behind the
album.

There are moments in “Tusk”
where the true talents of the 1 A
musicians are evident-as in the title
cut, “Tusk,” “Storms” and
“Never Make Me Cry.”‘ However,
most of the album is rather shallow
and the songs leave the listener
with the feeling that their money
has been wasted on a rather weak
effort by one of the foremost
groups in the recording industry.

It appears that Fleetwood Mac is
a ﬁrm believer in the idea that if
you’ve got a good thing, stick with
it! With the phenomenal success of
‘ ‘Rumors, ’ ’ there is obviously a
substantial base from which to
build.

Many of the similarities on
“Rumors” can be found on this
new record. The recording

‘ engineers Ken Caillat and Richard

Dashut who worked on ‘ ‘Rumors”
also produced and recorded
“Tusk,” along wifh Mick
Fleetwood. Some of the tracks
were actually recorded at
Buckingham’s home-based studio.
Also, the artist who did the
lettering on the previous albums
was in charge of the artwork on
“Tusk.”

Bridging Gap

By STEVE GUIDAS

Ronnie Milsap
Images ’
RCA

-Country and western performers
tend to follow one of two schools;
that of the Hank Williams style
music or that of the modern country
music that tends to coincide with
the pop charts. Few artists in the
ﬁeld are able to successfully bridge
the gap. Ronnie Milsap is one of
the few.

Milsap, blind from birth, was a
child prodigy in every sense of the
word. Having mastered the violin
at the age of seven, the piano at

‘eight and the guitar at twelve, he
later formed his own rock group,
the “Apparitions,” while in high
school. -

What followed were years of
searching for the right musical
idiom which eventually brought
Milsap back to his North Carolina
roots and country music.

Milsap’s latest album release,
“Images,” is morepthan a
showcase of his wide range of
musical talents. Both vocal and

. instrumental, it exhibits his ability
' in performing country and western

music over a diverse genre.

Songs like “Nobody Likes a Sad
Song," “Keep the Night Away"
and “Just Because it Feels Good,"
traditional country songs of
loneliness and cheating, have a rich
and mellow sound. These songs,
as well as the others that round out
the ﬁrst side of the album, “I

A ' Really Don’t Want to Know” and

"You Don’t Look For Love,” show

Clearly the most noteworthy cut
of the two record set is the title
track. It is a powerful song that is
as engaging and interesting as any
effort from this group. Other good
songs include ‘ ‘Angel, ’ ’ ‘ ‘Beautiful

“Never Make Me Cry.” “Angel”
marks the point in the music where
the group ﬁnally gets going. Until
this point, they seem to hide
behind a false facade of,intense
production. ‘

The singing of Christine McVie
and Stevie Nicks combined with the
occasional bursts of entertaining
music are really the main pulls that
keep “Tusk” from doing a
nose-dive. The best lyrics are
those written by Nicks. She has a

of country music that he grew up

In contrast to-the’ first, the
second side offers country songs
inﬂuenced by other musical ﬁelds,
such as jazz androck.

The first song, “Hi-Heel

Sneakers,” with a‘ sound of modern '

Blues, utilizes more of Milsap’s
instrumental abilities than any
other song on the album.

The following tune, “In No Time
at All, ” has a Barry Manilow style
of overproduction. Another cut,
“All Good Things Don’t Have to
End,” follows along this same line,
but to a lesser degree.

“Delta Queen” comes through
as a rodeo cowboy type of song
reminiscent of Arlo Guthrie’s
“Cherokee Princess.”

The last song on the album, “Get

western performers can get into
some funk—or at least be
inﬂuenced by it.

The main problem with this

album may be due to the success of
“Rumors. ’ ’ Since its release,
“Tusk” has had to live up to the
standards of its infamous
predecessor lest anyone think that
the grouphad burned itself out.
Add to that the length oftime and
the tremendous cost of production
and it is easy to see why there were
such high expectations and
excitement prior to its completion".

Yusef Lateef
“In A Temple Garden”
C.T.I.

In the ’50’s, Yusef Lateef was
known as one of the principal
innovators in the post bebop era,
always with a ﬂair for the L
unexpected. For example, Lateef .
was the ﬁrst to use the oboe in
mainstream jazz. Some of his more
important work contained a kind of
“Far East” type of feeling. This
attraction for eastern music was
supported by his unique use of the
ﬂute, oboe, shahnai, and soprana
sax. Lateef frequently employed
the use of an euphonium, a brass
instrument somewhat like a
baritone horn and considered by >
some to be synonomous. But soon
after this creative period i_n the
'50’, Lateef found it no longer
necessary to be overly innovative or
creative. _

“In A Temple Garden” is, to say
the least, nothing to get excited
about. Most of the tunes are
written and arranged by Jeremy
Wall, keyboardist of the popular
fusion group Spyro Gyra. For the
most part, the disc resembles
Spyro Gyra except for Lateef’s
unmistakable tone. The title track,
“In A Temple Garden,”
foregrounds Lateef’s ﬂute. The
tune has remnants of his eastern
inﬂuences. The ﬂute improvisation
is fair and Wall does nicely on the
piano. The following tune, .
“Bismillah, ” is a basic Spyro Gyra

type of tune, with the sax out front.

“Confirmation” follows as the
most electric tune on the disc. The
melody is nice and Lateef shows
that he can still do a good job of

much more thanthey have recently
shown. If Mac would concentrate
more on the quality and precision

of their product and less on the
promotion and advertisement they
would soon be back where they
were two years ago—on top.

“Tusk” does not appear '

‘destined for any immediate s

greatness but will no doubt succeed
due largely to the soft gentle style
of music which Fleetmack Mac can
create.as well as anyone and is still
in great demand. However, the
public will not continue to buy
albums of inferior quality

v regardless of the artist. Much

better things are expected from
this group in the future. How
about it, Mac?

No Changeln ’Femp|eGarden’

improvisation on the tenor sax.
“Nayaz’ ’ is no frills music and fits_
in great with the rest of this electric

' fusion. This realy tune is simply

tenor and Wall on acoustic piano.
“Jeremiah” opens the second
side with a nice piece of electronic
fusion. The melody is structured a
lot like “Conﬁrmation” with a nice
tempo change following Wall’s
solos. “J eremiah’ ’ is followed by
“Honky Tonk,” a mediocre tune.
“How I Loved You” is a short a
modern blues number featuring on
vocal and tenor sax; again, nothing
to get excited about. The disc
concludes with another Sypro Gyra
sounding tune called “Morocco” a
.nicely moving melody with Lateef
using the rough approach to tenor
improvisation atop a very smooth
feeling tune. A
Lateef has made a deﬁnite ' .

\ change from the.old days. This

album isn’t going toturn a lot of
heads and it won’t be a bog seller,
it is listenable. Jeremy Wall has
put together some/nice tunes such
as: “Jeremiah,” “Confirmation,”
and ‘ ‘Nayaz. ” Lateef’s forte on
this album is versatility. It may not
bea creative masterpiece, but it is
interesting because Lateef does a
nice job of varying his style.

Does anybody remember ,
“Autophysiopsychic?” Even with
all of this considered, the album is
really just the same ol’ Lateef. Why
great musicians like Lateef
continue to water down their _
abilities by doing average sounding
fusion is a real wonder. It isn’t
selling, it’s not impressing
anybody, and it can't be doing
much for the artists’ egos.
Hopefully there will be a
renaissance of real jazz, and
hopefully it will be soon.

Keep the Fire
Kenny Loggins
Columbia

Last year wasa big one for
Kenny Loggins, with the hit
“Whenever I Call You Friend” and

the authoring effort with Mike
McDonald that produced ‘ ‘What A
Fool Believes.’ ’ The record that
contained Loggins’ versions of
these, ‘ ‘Nightwatch, ” went
platinum-plus, and established him
as a major force in contemporary
rock. ' ,

‘‘Keep the Fire’ ’ is a suitable
title for his newest release, because
(in a few songs at least) it does just

‘ that. It’s also assuitable followup,
and is a fair progression for this

' aurally exciting artist. -

There are a few major
differences, though. This record is
more jazzy and punchy, and almost
forces the listener at times to recall
Loggins and Messina’s later work
And this is probably the album’
biggest fault. ’ '

Loggins seems to do his most
moving performances when he
writes with others. The best song
on the record, “This Is It,” is a
good example of this, co-written
with McDonald. With a few
exceptions, the rest don’t offer the
smooth melodies that characterized
‘ ‘ Nightwatch, ” particularly “Wait
A Little While.”

One tune that does approach this
style is “Now and Then,” » -
co-written with Jeff Bouchard;
other collaborations include V
“Who’s Right, Who’s Wrong” -
with Richard Page, featuring some
wispy, emotionally moving tenor
sax by Michael Brecker; the title ’ '
track, done with Loggins’ wife,
with some electronically done
background vocals; and the last of
the standout tunes is a Stephen
Bishop joint effort, titled ‘ ‘Give It

_ Half A,Cha‘nce. ” It bears close

‘ resemblance to Art Garfunkel’s

' Bishop tune on “Fate For Break-

‘ fast"-,—called “Sail On A
Rainbow.” The theme expressed
is the same as that of ‘ ‘Wait A
Little While.” >

Although Loggins is not a bad
writer, he still seems to lack
something that only other

. songwriters can give to his songs. _
Hopefully he will strengthen his

'-own material just a bit-, and his next
release will demonstrate his own ,
true potential.

_ “Conception: Gift of Love” is his

Hutcherson is the perfect example
that a truly gifted performer

‘ doesn’t have to keep changing his
style and/ or band to remain

Loggins Gets Friendly Hand On ’Keep The Fire’

a Kenny Loggins’ new album “Keep The Fire” gets by with some help

Leary, bass; and Eddie Marshall,
drums, share the composing on the
albums. Hutcherson’s vibes
contain a large amount of timbre.
Understanding thus, Hutcherson
has always used a high woodwir;.‘
soloist to add balance to the
melodic fronts of his combos.
Usually a ﬂute or soprano sax is
used to establish this balance. On

. the last two albums the ﬂutist has
been everyone’s favorite, Hubert
Laws. i

Hutcherson’s major asset is
structure. He uses just the right
balance of tight harmonies, time,
rhythm changes and variations of
tempo. To add to Hutcherson’s
record of time structuring, he has
had “Conception” produced and
arranged by band leader Cedar
Walton. Walton is a true master of
syncopation and has pulled out all
of the stops on this one.

“No Siree Bob” is an uptempo
cut featuring Hutcherson’s great
timing and harmonic
improvisiation. Cables and Laws
help make the tune a real delight.
Walton’s “Clockwise” is a smooth
ballad featuring Walton’s subtle
approach to horn section ,
arranging. Leary’s “Remember To
Smile’ ’ is a very fast tune.
Hutcheson’s solo is very quick,
light, and fresh and Cables’ solo is
comparably the same. The horn
arrangement is in the proper mood
and never overpowering.

Cables’ “Dark Side, Light Side”
is another lesson in structuring.

' The tune changes direction with

nearly every statement, yet
remains smooth. Hutcherson’s solo
- is nothing-less than a marvel and
Walton’s arrangements are once
againperfect. Leary’s “Hold My
Hand’ ’ is another mellow
composition. It’s a nice tune but a

bit overshadowed by the rest of the .

great material on this album.
Marshall's “Dreamin’ ”_ may have
possibly stolen the entire I
performance. The harmonic
structure is perfect and Cables’ and
Hutcherson’s solos give lessons in
harmonic touch. All of this is
topped off by yet another excellent
Walton arrangement. “Quiet
Fire” is a Cables tune and it closes
the set in a big band fashion.

“Conception” is an overall
listening pleasure and learning ex-
perience. Very few musicians

Ponty’s ' ’l’assion’

’Earthi_er Sound  

By WALT WATSON

A Taste For Passion
J ean-Luc Ponty
Atlantic ,_ .

J ean-Luc Ponty, as_ composer, >1
musician, and orchestrator, has
produced a landmark piece of tech-
nical and artistic prowess which

i proves you can teach an old master ‘a '

new expression. ‘ ‘A Taste For
Passion” possesses much the same
instrumentation as Ponty’s ’78
studio release. ‘ ‘Cosmic
Messenger. ’ ’ * .

The greatest difference between. .

the two albums can be found in'
theme. Where the compositional
focus of Cosmic Messenger” was
on the mysterious and the
supernatural, ‘ ‘A Taste For
V Passion” seems to be directed
toward an earthier, warmer
musical statement.
‘ ‘A Taste For Passion” opens

. with the soft, lilting ensemble piece

“Stay With Me,” where guitarist

Joaquin Lievano provides warm

melody for Ponty’s lofty, romantic

electric violin. ‘ -

“Sunset Drive” is an L.A.

‘ street-wise song that immediately
conjures up images of a late
afternoon cruise in a Porsche 924
with the sun slowly dissipating.
This image is impressed upon the
listener by Ralphe Armstrong’s
mean and bouncy bass lines, Jamie
Glaser’s hip guitar solo, Ponty’s
arrogant phrasing when it’s his
turn to open up, and most
deﬁnitely, Allan Zavod’s
sophisticated chords on _ -
synthesizer. Ponty takes great
pains in keeping the compositions
brief and to the point in order to '
maintain clear, moving musical
images.

The only possible
dissapointment on the album is
“Beach Girl.” Its apparent
commercial appeal makes it seem
cold, and..emotionless. Later‘
listenings may reveal Ponty’s -
attempt to emote a carefree,
happy-go-lucky attitude.

Side two begins with the title
track featuring Zavod playing a
rippling, rushing acoustic piano '
intoand out of the solos. Most

listeners will enjoy this cut because
of the surging surprise attack given
by percussionist Casey Scheuerell
on drums, and the way the rousing
guitar and violin solos by Lievano
and Ponty work to round out the
driving rhythms of mighty Casey.

There is a great deal of
experimenting done on this album
in regard to irregular meter (‘ ‘Life
Cycles” and “Obsession”). Or-

chestration, as on earlier albums, is 4

further explored with smooth ‘
cello-like bass lines (check out
Armstrong near the end of ‘ ‘A
Taste For Passion”), taut, agile (
harmonies (“Give Us A Chance,”__ ._
‘ ‘ Reminiscence,’ ’ ‘ ‘Life Cycles, ’ ’

‘ and “Sunset Drive”), as well as

ﬂowing ones (“Dreamy Eyes” and
“Stay With Me”). The closing
track, “Farewell, ” completes the
album’s theme, showing typical ’
Ponty sensuality. It mixes a touch
of France’scountryside grandeur,
topping it with a light, funky pulse
that leaves thelistener’s appetite

‘ » desirably whetted.

J ean-Luc Ponty is jazz/ rock
fusion’s premier violinist, proving
again as composer to be not only
capable of successfully harnessing
the naked energy of progressive
rock with the improvisation
demands of jazz, but adding an .
emotional, even romantic sense to
demand your attention. He gets
his point across with feeling and
truly has a taste for passion. ’

‘Sports Play With

  New Sound
.By GEORGE SHANER ’ /  

' Don’t Throw Stones
The Sports
Arlsta

Pop/ Rock seems to be the most ’
obvious rputgto the top for aspiring
superstars these days.

Considering the cover of The
Sports’ debut album, “Don’t

Throw Stones, ” one almost expects ’

clones of either The Cars or Cheap’
_ Trick. ' ’

It’s a pleasure then to be
surprised by a band that owes more
to Van Morrison's soul and the

’ no-nonsense sincerity of Britain’s
Pub Rock movement rather then
ill-advised attempts to recycle what '
is currently popular. Further, lead
vocalist Stephen Cummings and
company owe enough to Elvis
Costello and Graham Parker (who
they thank in the liner notes) to

’ bring home the stylistic debt both
these artists owe to ‘ ‘Van the
Man. ’ ’ 4' H

Considering The Sports’ own
music, the hottest cut here is ‘ ‘Who
Listens To The Radio,” a neat little I
rocker which sounds like Elvis ' .
Costello's “Radio, Radio,” ﬁltered
through Morrision. This can be
contrasted with “Big Sleep,” a

spacy ballad, or, “Step By Step,” a .~

Byrds’ style rocker of the sort that
is almost obligatory for a pop band
these days.

Overall though, The Sports’
biggest virtue is the possibility of ’

development. Insteadof freezing - ,

themselves in the current style,

, The Sports’ late '70s R&B sound

V should be capable of quite a bit of _ pg
stretch. ‘

With the dynamism suggested
by the group's live sleeve picture
and the unassuming melodies and
lyrics of their first album. The

Sports should have a good shot at a _ ’

promising career.

  Not Quite John, Paul , George and Ringo——But Awful Close

(Continued from page 2)
Paul McCartney clone and original cast

member (bunk 1), who sat in for two gigs
last Wednesday and Thursday ni hts. .
The dynamic magic of “Beatlemania”
is" the amazingly real sound the four
-musicians on stage are able to emulate.
Note for note, beat for beat they

reproduce that unmistakable Beatles’

aura to the concert stage and open it up to
-those of us who have only known the
music from records.

Many of the songs of “Beatlemania”

' had never been performed in a concert

setting by the Fab Four. Hearing “A Day

. in the Life” or “Get Back” or “Come

Together” or ‘‘I Am the Walrus” come
alive with such concern for authenticity
gives the Beatles’ mystique an extra bit of
timelessness.

Lacking any legitimate story line,
“Beatlemania” chronologically traces
American social history and the Beatles’
inﬂuences upon it. The show begins with
Chubby Checkers’, “Let's Twist Again”
as a “Camelot: Pre-Beatles” opening and
closes with the ﬁnale of “Let It Be” as a

Times -Square-esque sign hovers above
with the words “Beatles Break Up.”
Divided into two acts, the production
moves through nine “scenes” .of the

Artist’s conception of new “Heaven ” Disco

Beatles’ career which include; “The 351330‘ 0f each W35 the “Tripping” 509119
Coming,» “Making It," “Dropping which featured the hallucinogenic in-
out,» .6-Flower power,” -‘Bottoming ﬂuences from the Sgt. Peppers/Magical

_Mystery Tour days. The tunes, “A Day
in the Life,” “Strawberry Fields
Forever,” “Penny Lane,” “Magical

Out,” and “Moving One.”

Of all the “Beatlemania” players who
appeared in Pittsburgh, Marshall
Crenshaw" and Don Linarest from the I
opening night cast were perhpas the most
accurate Lennon/McCartney team.
Visually and vocally they captured the
essence of the duo with an almost eerie
sense of deja-vu. Crenshaw as Lennon
was especially powerful during _the
conservative “collar. and tie” days of the
show during which he handled lead vocals
on “I Want’ to Hold Your Hand,” “She
‘Loves You,” “Help,” and “If I Fell.”
Linarest picked up the pace in Act II with
his rendition of “Fool on the Hill,” .
“Michelle,”. “Helter Skelter,” “Hey
Jude,” and “The Long and Winding
Road.”

Of all the shows,’ the most ‘outstanding

the Sky with Diamonds” pulled together
the music, costuming, visuals and
lighting into one grandoise orchestration. .

The overall effect of “Beatlemania” is
one of reﬂection. The music, the faces,

from anger, disgust and horror to
fondness, awe and amazement. In
short—the show is an experience.

Most recently, the producers of
“Beatlemania,” Steve Leber and David
Krebs, once again face a $60 million‘ court

‘ﬁght, this time over television and movie’
rights. .Whatever the outcome, “Beatle-
gmania” remains a shrewd business move
and a concept that was long overdue.

1,000 square foot dance ﬂoor, a
restaurant overlooking the dance
ﬂoor, and a special dance ﬂoor for '
members. Heaven will also feature
the “Gold Room,” which is avery
plush juice and champagne bar.
Heaven will also sport one of the
most marvelous lighting systems
ever. The sound will be anything
but second rate with 1,000 watts of
power and an assortment of 32
speakers, some weighing as much
as 450 pounds.

Heaven could provide
Pittsburgh's disco scene with a

needed shot in the arm but it will
be interesting to see who will be
there. Heaven will, no doubt, be
expensive and maybe ‘a bit~too
plush’ .for the average .

, Pittsburgher. Heaven‘ is designed
to meet the taste of the upper
economic class caucasion in a
working class city where most of
the dancers are lower middle
economic class young -Black people.
Since people have spent years in
cramped bars with dance floors,
Heaven will probably freak a lot of

_ your more creative dancers out.

Just think, now people will actually

, have room to really move.
