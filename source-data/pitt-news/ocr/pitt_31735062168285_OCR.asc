Stormy Debate Precedes Vote

Senate Apprves lection Recess

by STEVE LUBETSKY

The Graduate School of.Public
Health Auditorium resembled a
battlefield on which words sub-
stituted for-weapons as ammuni-
tion. The University Senate mem-
bers approved the proposed po-
litical action recess June 19 at
their meeting but not before the
eruption of a bitter debate.

Initiating procedures was Dr.
John Townsend, physics profes-
sor, who briefly outlined the pro-

visions of the proposal submitted‘

by the Committee on Student Af-
fairs: suspension of classes on
Election Day and the day preced-
ing, excusing absences of stu-
dents who wish to participate in
campaigns the week prior to the
election; appearance of political
candidates on campus and discus-
sion of vital issues; establishment
of a Citizenship Information Cen-
ter which would provide'informa-
tion pertinent to the election.

PROPOSAL ATTACKED _

Then a showdown ignited, as
Professor" of English Dr. Law-
rence Lee, known for his contri-
butions of political essays to the
Pittsburgh Press, argued against
a recess. He claimed the “previ-
ous election campaigns have been
successful without a recess” and
predicted “the destruction of. the
University” should passage oc-
cur,

Former Student‘ Government’
President Scott Baum, in repudia- '

tion of Lee, referred to him as “a
‘professor, who having nothing
better to do, writes vague politi-
cal commentary on a semi-weekly

V basis.” Baum demonstrated that

“people lamented in the past be-
cause the University failed to as-
sume a moral standpoint” and
mentioned the universities of

-Nazi Germany as examples. He
contended _that .“the University i’

cannot live in the past because the

past will never happen again.”

Robie To

Leave Pitt



Dr. Fred S. Robie, director of
admissionsat the University, will
assume the presidency of the Jef-
ferson County -Technical Insti-
tute in Steubenville. Ohio.

His appointment, according to
the Board of Trustees of the Insti-
ture, will be effective July 1.

The school for which Dr. Robié
is leaving is» one of ten technical

institutes in .a two-year college‘

system in the State of Ohio.‘ The
'institute will graduate its first

= class at the end of June, 1970.

Dr. Robie has taught speech at
West Virginia University in Mor-
gantown, W. Va., and at Pitt.

For nine years prior to assum-

"ing administrative duties at Pitt.

he was a special agent for the

Federal Bureau of Investigation.

Dr. Robie has also served as

eetoit , of adniis

Dr. Jack Belzer, associate di-
rector of the Knowledge Avail-
ability Systems Center and pro-
fessor of Engineering, questioned
if the proposal is to satisfy the.
‘demands of all students. or only a
special interest group.

Dr. Townsendreplied that the
matter was taken up previously
at the Senate Council meeting. and
the support is overwhelming.

Scott Baum added that although
there is opposition to the amend-
ment, there is also a significant
segment of students in favor of it.
“There is no reason to question
this,” he maintained.

ALTERNATIVE OFFERED
An alternate proposal was sug-
gested which called for allowance
of voluntary political absences
Monday and Tuesday and the ex-
tension of the recess throughout

' the entire University, unlike the

original proposal which applied
only to schools with a common
calendar.

Dr. Jerome Schneewind, dean
of the College of Arts and Sci-
ences. objected on grounds that
"the original proposal was non-
coercive,“ and that “research
workers would create problems
because some would report to
their jobs, while others would
take these days off." .

Baum pointed out that “no one
cares about who cuts, and many
professors may penalize. Free
days are healthier for the demo-
cratic process because students

would be relieved from-the fear of
cutting.”

This new resolution was voted
on and defeated unanimously.

Discussion then terminated. as
faculty decided upon the original
draft by the Student Affairs Com-
mittee: it was adopted by a 76-52
margin.’

UCWR

Women

by VIRGINIA JOYCE
Associate Editor

Agitated women at the Univer-
sity have gone to the government
to protest "discriminatory hiring
practices" and the alleged firing

, of an activist employee.

The University Committee for
Women's Rights is utilizing Exe-
cutive Orders 11246’ and 11375 to
compel the University to speed up
its “equalization plan."

Both Orders. enforced by the
Office of Federal Contract Com-
pliance. expressly forbid "sex
discrimination by federal con-

- tractors." ~

They further stipulate that ‘ ‘con-
tractors with 50 or more em-
ployees and a contract exceeding
$50,000. must develop a written
plan of affirmative action to pre-
vent discrimination based on
race, creed, color, sex‘ or nation-
at origin.”

Ina Braden. president of the
UCWR. told the University Sen-
ate on June 19 that the group has
been in communication with the
Federal Board since last October.
She hinted that federal inspectors
were expected to arrive’ on cam-
pus within three weeks.

In order to avert a possible cut
in federal funding. the UCWR in
cooperation with "other women
feministsat the University” drew
up a comprehensive set of pro-
posals. —

One called for the establish-
ment of an Office to Equalize the
Status of Women under a Vice-
Chancellor to be appointed by

,Sept. 11. The budgetary alloca-

tion request nearedthe $300,000
mark. :

_ TUITION INCREASE

Vice-Chancellor of Finance Edi-
son Montgomery's budget report
preceeded the election discussion.
He revealed that a tuition increase
of 20 per cent would be forthcom-
ing for graduate and undergrad-
uate students. with even a greater
hike -in the health-centered pro-
grams.

Montgomery further acknow-
ledged the obstacle of an unheed-
ed financial gap consisting of
_$3.4-3.9 million: The state is ex-
pected, he said, to supplement
this by appropriating the Univer-

sity the funds it requires to oper- «

ate. Harrisburg’ will take action
after the first of next year, he
noted.

The Vice-Chancellor stated that
he was confident that the augmen-
tation would be enacted. but. he
added. "it depends on the outcome
of the election.“ If this additional
sum is not granted. it could pro-
duce a $320-370,000 monthly def-

the Chancellor's suggestion for a
Committee on Women’s Oppor-
tunities. The women objected to
the “advisory" capacity of the
proposed committee and its non-
funded position.

One of the most outspoken rep-
resentatives at the. Senate meet-
ing has since received her walk-
ing papers from the University
and she‘s taking her case‘ to the
Mayor's Commission on Human
Relations.

Dr. Jo Ann Gardner. former
LRDC employee, has charged the
University with: . .

—discrimination in hiring
——unequal allocation of work
—termination of employment
—the taking of retributory meas-

ures against‘ her for her Wom-
en’s Rights efforts.

Dr. Gardner is a national lead-
er in the movement and has ad-
dressed several national profes-

' sional groups on the issue of fem-

inist inequality.

The psychologist, along with
Dr. Braden, Nancy Van Vuuren,

-history instructor atvthe Univer—_
sity, and Elizabeth Scott, presi-

dent of the local Council for Wom-
en‘s Rights attended a national
conference early this monthin th
capitol. ‘

son Montgomery’s refusal to pro-_

WOMEN’S OPPORTUNITIES ‘ ‘

Other developments concerne- . .
the issue of equal employmen
and benefits for women.

Approved was a resolution foe
a Senate Committee on Facultj
Health and Welfare. A motion fog".
the institution of an Office t '
Equalize the Status of Women. 
with paid personnel,‘ was tabled. '

A proposal by Dr. Schneewin.
to implement day-care centers b - 4,
Sept. for children of students wa~ » pl
introduced to the floor. The move "
would entail an allocation of $80.; .
000. ‘

Since the attendance had dwin
died by now to less than 100, an of ,
fical count was impossible. Hovs:
ever, it was agreed to conduct 2 
straw ballot and place the motior’ ‘
on the agenda of the next meeting,
It was approved 82-0.

Extending the notion of the Uni- 
versity's state-relatedness tc. .
label it a state "agency,” the 1
women referred to the Common . 
wealth Act S 2886, subsection 2.

This provision stipulates that-
"any account dealing with the use];
of services and any minute order?‘
or decision by an agency fixing
the personal rights, privileges
duties or obligations of any per-
son or group of persons" is public 
record. - » 

No action has yet been taken by;
the University. -

CORRECTION

An error in fact was commit-
ted in the June 16 edition o
. The Pitt News in the story en-
titled “Revamping Slated in Stu-‘
dent Affairs.” It was reported in
the article that the positions of
Director of University Housing‘.
the Director of the Student ,
Health Service and the Director V;
of the Placement Service would
be reporting to the newly or
dained Dean of Student Devel- »
opment. Rather, these three :~.--
men will be reporting to the As-
sistant Vice-Chancellor for Stu-If
dent Affairs Bernard Koboslty V
In this way they will retain, ac
cording to an official source,/’a :
greater measure of autonomy
Further, The Pitt News apolo-
gizes for the typographical mis-
takes which termed the 
Dean the “Dean of.Student Gov-
ernment” and later referred?" to
‘ him as the “Dean of Student . f‘
V fair_s."—.-Virginia Joyce. V I

Student Affairs
Story Erroneous

(Editor's Note: The following letter was penned by a member of
Assistant Vice-Chancellor for Student Affairs Bernard Kobosky’s staff.
Kobosky first announced his revamping plans at a closed staff meeting
held on the afternoon of June 15. The errors that the writer refers to
in his complaint are correct. There is a correction box on page one which
clears up the problems and deciphers certain typographical errors that
I may have been confusing to the reader. The writer requested anony-
, mit due to his pos'yion on the Student Affairs staff.—V.J.)

Dear Miss Joyce:

If the story concerning the revamping of the Student Af-
fairs Area was given to you as it was printed in the June 16.
1970, edition of The Pitt News, more research should be put into
things before they are published. 4

According to information given by the Assistant Chancellor
for Student Affairs in his meeting with his staff. only the Coun-
seling Center and the activities of the Student Union will. come
under the framework of the Dean of Student Development.

, Placement. Housing. and the Student Health Service will
remain separate and will report directly to him. -

When questioned on this structure he indicated that he had
his own rationale for not making .these logical changes.

He also indicated that he had warned Mr. Vrana. the Direc-
tor of Housing. that he damn well better get along with the pro-
gram and ideas of the new Dean or the Housing operation would
V have to become part of the greater structure.

.» It would seem that a proper reorganization cannottake place.
' * because certain friendships preclude it.

These will be no new Student Union and it seems that all ac-
tivities carried ongby the Union Director and his staff will be
V placed under a Director of Student Activities. - .

». Has there been any consideration for anyone but Mr. Mark-

us in this position? Even though Mr. Kobosky led a number of

-*others to believe they would be considered when a new Dean
was chosen, the position has been filled. ' '

So have the positions of Director of Special Programs and
_ Director of Research. and Information. Is this the proper frame-
’ . work to bring in a new Dean?

. vs How can the welfare of the students really be considered
gwhen there cannot be an honest opportunity for a new man to
have a choice of the people to work with him. - y

- It would seem that the best man for the job would feel that
he should have this opportunity. that he should not have to feel “
,-that ‘he will not have a free handin his operation (as often has
been the case in all decisions coming from the Assistant Chan-
--cellor and his Executive Assistant rather than involving the pro-"
ff7per.deans and directors). . _ V _

."...'Would not a man observing these things. if he were the kind‘
 of Dean we need, refuse thepositioni’ ‘

: Where is the student involvement in all of this‘? Is the stu-

- dent welfare important to him when he sets up conditions which
might very well preclude getting the best Dean of Student De-
’ _velopment available at this point in time? "

 His predecessor was often accused of not dealing honestly
‘with students and staff and of placing friends in positions of re-
sponsibility. but is he any better.

If one is going to reorganize an area. why not go all the‘
way? Has anyone not dealt with him who has not first had to lis-
ten to his sad story of how difficult it is to be in hislposition?
_.‘;Perhaps he doesn't belong there. Has hebeen any more honest .
ffwith students than he has with his staff? . A, ’
 Having been a part of this University"-ofvaynurnber of years.

   

 

 

Campus Police Blast

 

Woman Superior  

(Editor's Note: The following
complaint was issued to the offices
of Chancellor Wesly Posvar, Vice-
Chancellor Edison Montgomery,
Charles Ray, captain of the Univer-
sity Police, police commander Lieu-
tenant Merrit and The Pitt News. It
was composed by about 20 men
in the department who labeled
themselves “Old Medium and New
Members, University of Pittsburgh
«Police/’)

Sirs;

As you no doubt already know
over 90% of the campus police
department has joined teamsters
Local 249. This was deemed ne-
cessary because the men in the
department have no say in the
policies that concern " them,
pay. fringe benefits. overtime
uniform allowance. schedules. or
shifts. a
..Pay is less than that of a jan-
itor; fringe benefits are less than
that; the yearly uniform allow-
ance is less than your monthly
cleaning and laundry bill; over-
time is run by dictator Divens

with no regard to seniority or'to .

the men who worked many. many
hours, when we were short of
personell and things were a lit-
tle sticky on campus. ‘

By and far. these are minor
and can be readly ironed out
over the bargaining table; Take a
random survey of the troops in

the field and you will find that
the biggest complaint is the dic-
tatorial policies of staff searg-
eant Divens. She has galded the
balls of even our newest men.

Her latest change of schedule
was put out on the pretext that
captain Ray felt there were men
on a job or shift too long. But
there are men on the same job
and shift as when I started (over
two years).

But she didn't fool anyone. we
all know it was done to try and
screw those she thought had any-
thing to do with organizing
the union. She didnot succeed.

In the little time I've been
here she has shifted men with
seniority dozens’ of times in or-
der to arrange a schedule for a
man going to school.

This is grossly unfair to the
older men who are the backbone
of the department. (Morepower
to the man who wants and can
get an education. We’re all for
students. Without them none of
us would have jobs).

But let’s fit the school to the
job not the job to-the school.

..Solution to jobs and shifts is
very simple. According to sen-
iority. give a man with over five
years his choice of job and shift.

With less time give him choice
ofjob and rotate shifts monthly,

any desired changes to be made
once a year.

We have men in the dept. who
have been here over two years,
completed the prescribed train-
ing and are still being paid less

..than a man or men recently

hired.

There is .no way anyone can
rationalize this because it just

causes dissent and bad feeling,n'-w
in the department. (Why should“-”‘
I do it? Joe's making more than

me).

This staff sargeant (or is it
administrative asst.) has gone
into tantrums, throwing things
from her desk and screaming be-
cause she didn’t get her way or
things didn’t suit her.

I sometimes wonder who is
the supervisor at varsity hall,
and so do a lot of other people.

Since this union thing has be-
come common knowledge she
has threatened men with loss of
jobs, benefits, shifts changes
'etc. these things have all been

reported to the N.L.R.B. and thqg‘
5“

bargaining agent. -

The only solution to your and
our main problem is to get her
out of the department before

_she does some real harm, and

causes some. really serious prob-
lems.

Zasloff Called Biased

Dear Editor: The Pitt News:

Even my intelligence was in-
sulted by the inclusion of a syn-
opsis of Dr. Zasloff's YMCA
Public Affairs Forum lecture in
the June 5 edition of The Pitt"
News. The article’ did not de-
serve even back page space.

I refer specifically to Dr. Zas-
loff's remarks concerning “the
government ‘of the United States"
has set up in South Vietnam"
which,he labelled a "narrow,-
corrupt. repressive. unpopular
military dictatorship."

' I was disappointed that a man
of such academic achievement in
the field of Political Science
would so blithely take-the al-
ready worn path of oversimplifi-
cation. . «

I spent fifteen years of my
life in Indochina because my

parents were missionaries to first
Cambodia and later, Vietnam.
I've‘ lived with those people,
speak the Cambodian language,
know the geography of the coun-
try first-hand. and I came away’
with the knowledge that "ex-
pert” opinions and broad gener-
alizations are fearfully subjec-
tive when they refer to Vietnam.

' Dr. Zasloff has reaffirmed my
belief.’ No Asian government can
be measured on-the scale that
we use on our American govern-
ment. - ’

Democracy is a theory at best
to the peasants of Indochina.
Their yardstick for government
is not democracy. not ‘even’ our
glorified “human rights." I

Their criteria is simply wheth-
er it is good. government on a
practical l level. ‘My experience

with Asian governments tells
me that the government of South
Vietnam has,neither failed mis-

erably nor achieved smashing ,—~
success. ‘ ' - 

My anger stems" not from the
fact that Dr. Zasloff obviously
knows little about Asian culture
and government, .but that as a

Political Scientist he was unable-

to assess that government in the
context of a war which is threa-
tening the existence of that na-
tion.

Dr. Zasloff seems to have ans-
wered the extremely difficult
questions which surround the
Vietnam. tragedy and then have
gathered his evidence to support

those answers. I say his .p're_—**
judice invalidates his reasoning.--I’

 Hey.‘ l'_‘I‘m a senior. ~»Gonna'

Something the great American

great American novel. A crea-
tive thing that is ever increa-
singly popular with “turned"

It's film. Moving film, “because

courses that haveanything, to

wow. I've read; enough books on
film criticism film history film
scripting. And I've‘ even read
all the books on lighting, cam-
era angles. composition cutting.

Now I want to make films —
to use the camera.. the lights. the
film and all of those books I‘ve
read. But where can I do this?
Why doesn‘t this university have
any undergraduate film cours-

by VIRGINIA JOYCE
Associate Editor

Womens’ liberation has under-
gone radical changes in the past
year, switching orientation from
the defensive to the offensive.

If the University can be proven
to be legally discriminatory to

-women, it may face a financial
crisis that would result in a loss

A.’ of honor along with funds.

The winning card in the wom-
cn's hands is the federal execu-
tive orders 1 11246 and 11375.
If its played right. the school is
in danger of losing thousands of

‘dollars in defense contract allo-
- cations.

According to the regulations.

‘any agency or organization that

,4 enjoys federal support must de-

..velop a written plan of “affirma-
tive action to prevent discrimina-

' rion based on race, creed, color,

sex or national origin."

HARVARD
The University Committee for

9 Women's Rights (UCWR). a fac-

ulty based protest group. is using
‘the precedent of Harvard Univer-
sity where $60 million has al-

ready. been withheld under the

orders.
The big question now resides in

' - what constitutes “affirmative ac-

tion." University Chancellor Wes-

ley- Posvar and UCWR President

Ina Braden certainly don’t see eye
‘ to eye on it.

The Chancellor’s reaction to the

' women’s demands is reminiscent

of his handling of black charges of
institutionalized racism prior to
the sit-in in the_Computer Center
in October of 1958.

Dr. Posvar. claiming that the
"University is opposed to all
forms of discrimination and fav-
ors equal opportunities for women
in respect both to education and
employment." has proposed the
launching of a “study" and the es-
tablishment of a non-funded “Ad-
visory Committee."

The study. organized in four
areas. will deal with educational
programs for women. career op-
portunities and admission proce-
dures. It is headed by men exclu-
sively. The final report is due
Jan. 15. 1971.

ADVISORY CAPACITY

The women come into the pic-
ture as advisors. An Advisory
Committee on Women's Oppor-
tunities. to be set up with an eight
month tenure. will be composed
of four faculty (three womenl.
four students (all women). four
employees (three women) and
four administrators (true to the
pattern. three women).

The women's resolutions are
along the same lines, but with a
much stronger tone: they want
money and legitimacy.

Their counter proposal called

for a funded Office to Equalize
the Status of Women, with no limi-’
tation date set. A second resolu-
tion treated the establishment of
a School for Interdisciplinary
Feminist Studies by September,
1970. Both measures, presented
at the University ‘Senate meeting
of June 19, were greeted by laugh-
ter in some cases and tabled with
dispatch. '
_ The rejection prompted. UCWR
member Nancy Van Vuuren. his-
tory instructor to react emotion-
ally. "-Don't you realize that the
federal government could with-
hold money from the University
if nothing is done?" she pleaded.
"Now things won't be finalized un-
til a year after they started."

This kind of placating condes- -
cension is a familiar phenomenon .

to the women and was a major
reason t'or the shift in their orien-
tation. ‘

You’re looking at something I”
you should be listening to.

 

 

THE UCWR AND sympathetic women wait in the outer office of the Chancellor to confront him with their demands
for an end to sexist discrimination here.

“LATENESS”

By the time the Senate was
ready to give at least cursory ap-
proval to a resolution dealing with
day care centers, the body of the
legislature had left.

The reasoning was "the late-
ness of the hour," but Dr. Marcia
Landy. English. pointed out that
the womens proposals had been
lowest priority on the meetings
agenda.

Feminist bitterness has been
compounded by “slaps in the
face” of the genre dished out by
President Nixon earlier in the
month. More than’ a thousand
women attended a Conference of
the Women’s Bureau in the capi-

c tol and they petitioned President

Nixon to speakbefore them,

   

His refusal. based on an earlier
committment to a Boy Scout meet-
ing. was "smoothened“ by the
substitition of a coffee hour to be
given by Mrs. Nixon.

Protesting the attitude. that
"women should handle women's
business." the Pittsburgh con-
ti_ngent. including Dr. Braden.
Elizabeth Scott. Joanne Gardner
and Miss Van Vuuren. boycotted
the coffee clatch.

In development. the Womens
Liberation movement has altered
its perspective. The concern no
longer involves the lack of wom-
en presidents. company heads and
diplomats. The context has grown
into a social-political one.

UP TO SOCIALISM
The Washington conference in-

quality, C’r7/rdcscmsio/4  

cluded among its proposals a plea
to end the wars in Southeast Asia
"for the attainment of social jus-
tice at home."

On the campus, Women‘s Liber-
ation, personified by Assistant
Dean of the College of Arts and
Sciences Roberta Salper is mov-
ing towards a socialist ideology.

Abetted by other feminists. Dr.
Salper is looking at the evils of
the "capitalist system" as the
basis for discrimination. be it ra-
cial, ethnic or sexual.

The changing direction is re-
flected attitudinally by the wom-
en agitators. They aregrowing
less and less concerned with con-
vincing men and antagonistic
women that sexist discrimination
exists; they are beginning to re-
gard it as a truth;

You will get more welcome.
more advice. and more confu-

cope with during your orienta-
tion period and during your
first few weeks here. so I‘ll
try to be very brief.

College can be very differ-
ent from high school--but it is
largely up to you to make it
so. There are very few require-
ments in the College of Arts
and - Sciences, and our new
grading policy—about which I
hope you will inform your-

 

selves-—makessit possible for you
to minimize the extent to which
you work solely for grades.

We offer an enormous range
of courses. We have a very well-
equipped library. The city offers
music. theatre. films. and many
other attractions. There are peo-
ple around who can give you
help in thinking about careers
and in deciding on courses of
study. But in the end. it all
rests on you.

Do you want to explore. to
investigate new possibilities. to
try out fields of study you never
heard of before. think through
the possibilities of careers you
have not previously contemplat-

University Commtiirtity

by CARL VAN HORN ‘

This year. "Freshman Orien-
tation" takes on a new name -
(New Student Workshop‘70.)
Workshop activity includes pan-
el discussions, lectures-. films,
and small dialogue sessions to
give new students an introduc-
tion to the academic. political
and social environment at the
University. ’ -

The central theme of the New
Student Workshop is (Alterna-
tives and Commitment — Today

(ACT)! New students are being
encouraged to find out what
alternatives are available to

them, while it is being stressed
that the commitment to seek out
opportunities must be theirs.
Since these new students. will
ACT on their own discretion in
the ‘next’ four years, thedecision
to attend any or all of the
scheduled programs is also
their decision.

  

  

\\\\\\\{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

\

We hope that new tudents
and their upperclass hosts will
not don ACT buttons and delve
into issues concerning Univer-
sity life alone. We extend an
invitation to all members of the
University community to attend
the scheduled events of the
workshop. The pwtir.-ipation of
students. ‘faculty. and staff who
have cultivated a degree of ex-
pertise about the University will
insure that the Workshop is a
microcosm of the campus envir-
onment.

With the active involvement
of the University community, the
Workshop. can best achieve its
prime goal: to provide entering
students with advance knowledge
of the -diversity of alternatives
they will face 'at the University
of Pittsburgh in 1970. \

ed. to look for friends from
groups you never ‘had contacts
with previously. to join in ac-
tivities that weren‘t available to
you‘? Or do you want to make
college into an extension of the
least appealing aspects of ‘high
school—examinations. grades.
courses chosen for you by others‘?

I hope you will take the for-
mer course of action. Universi-
ties exist in large part to explore
new areas of knowledge, and col-
leges have the function of en-
abling their students to' explore
things that are new to them.
If you don't take advantage of
this while you are in college,
you are missing what may well
be your last opportunity to do
it.

We live in times of great po-
litical tensionand social stress.
No one is unaware of the_ fact
that college campuses have
figured prominently in news-
papers in these connections. It
is important to you as citizens
and potential or actual voters to
be aware of the problems and
the alternatives. and to equip
yourselves to take a responsible
part in providing well-informed
leadership. Your college educa-
tion should help you here. but
too narrow a definition of "rele-
vance" can mislead you as bad-
ly as a total ignoring of today's
problems. It is extremely dif-
ficult to ,be sure that even the
most abstruse knowledge will
not be needed to dea-l‘with some
pressing problem in the future.

Your college education is not
meant primarily to make you

a complete expert inany field.,

Its aim" is very largely to put
you in a position from which
you can go on to learn about
the fields that interest you and
to understand their bearing on

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

  

other fields and problems. You
shouldgthus try to equip your-
self for further explorations at
the same time that you are look-
ing at particular disciplines
and areas of study for -the first
time. If these two points guide
you in your selection ofcourses.
you’ll find more than enough
to keep you busy and interested
for many terms.

..Your advisor in the College
Advising Center will be glad to
of'fer you help in selecting your
courses. Faculty members will

Posvar Welcomes Freshmen

Chancellor’s Message 

On behalf of the entire uni-
versity community. .let me ex-
tend to you a warm welcome to
the University of Pittsburgh.

Your entry into the university
is. for most of you. the most
important undertakingso far in
life. This orientation program
is planned to help you become

-acquainted with_ the University

of Pittsburgh and with many
aspects of university life.

In a university. each student
has an exciting variety of oppor-
tunities to discover more about
himself and his society. He comes
here not only to acquire skills
and knowledge. but also to de-
fine and pursue his interests. to
test his capacities. and to develop
his capabilities as fully as he
can. '

The university is, therefore,
more than a training ground for
a career. It can assist the stu-
dent in under-standing contem-
porary society, its traditions as
well as its deficiencies. It thus

provides the student with an op-.

portunity to mature in an en-

they will be wel-

vironment of intellectual stimu-  
lation. These vital years should 

develop in the student new ap-

preciation, new bases for judg-
new modes of creative-
thinking and new ways to apply . '

ment,

his energies and talents.

The social aspects of univer-
sity life are important parts of
the educational process. There

are opportunities to enjoy activ— * A

ities and fellowships that are
unique to the college setting.
And there are many possibilities
for associating with students

graphic and cultural back-

grounds.

I hope that you will savor‘,
these aspects ‘of student life, dur-' A

ing the orientation. and that you
will learn something, also. of
the deeper purposes of the uni-

versity.

The lamentations of Lawrence Lee, Pitt Pro-
"fessor of English, appear regularly in the Sunday
_’edition of_ the Pittsburgh Press.

During the past few months, Professor Lee has
labeled our schools armed fortresses and “intell-
Jectual nurseries” and likened university leaders
' to Neville Chamberlain.

This distinguished poet and academician has
compared American students to “Nazi Storm
- Troopers, demoralizers, Indians, destructors,
. ‘traitors, dynamiters, bullies” and “invaders.”
ind he has warned the people of Pittsburgh that
student involvement in our nation's political pro-
_cess can lead only to the destruction of the Un-
‘ iversities. . '
 I am not yet an established member of the
"Academic community, I suppose, nor even of the
English Department. g ‘

But I have yet to meet a Nazi Storm Trooper.
Not once have I been confronted by a demoraliz-
. er, a destructor, an invader, a traitor, a dynamit-
er. The only bullies I have known at Pitt were
assistant administrators working for the Registrar
' or behind the desk at Student Accounting.

..I went to the library to re-read Lawrence Lee’s
columns before facing the typewriter. I read them
" once and then again and again. I went home
nd had dinner and returned to read them some
, nore. Each time I stopped for a cigarette or a

cup of coffee I promised myself that I would
“ keep cool, that I would be objective, that I would
maintain an acceptable distance as any journalist’
must do.

And yet, all the while I knew it was not

nent, a kind of sadness.

“The young can accomplish nothing unless they
learn something (writes Lee). Many know nothing
unless we the living have taught them something.
Many have experienced nothing but riot and our in-
dulgence. Still, they remain discontent.”

 (Should students know only what we decide

_they should know? Can one not learn from in-

f dependent study? From personal experience?
, Should riot and indulgence erase discontent?)

;ever university — some of us remember Munich.

who has betrayed his opportunities? )

“This plan (to allow students at Pitt two days

the continuing destruction of the university."

How does student involvement in the American

come to young people are the Jaycees and the

centerfold of Playboy magazine. .

They don’t know; we no longer expect them
to know. We look aheadlto 1972 and we pray.

But ‘Professor Lawrence Lee is an entirely
different source. He is a representative of the
University of Pittsburgh, of the academic com-

by DON MARBURY
Editor

In September of 1967, 17-year-old Donald Marbury came
down from one of Pittsburgh's Black ghettos, the Hill District,
to ascend the steps of a building he had before only casually

glanced at occasionally from his bedroom window, called the.

Cathedral of Learning.

He was a freshman in the University of Pittsburgh and the
thought that a high paying job, a home in suburbia, and ever
growing eliteness and status were only four years away, was
constantly in his mind. ‘

Life was beautiful for Don. He was thinking about pledging
a fraternity like so many of the guys were doing. He was doing
a little poorly in his studies but he wasn’t worried because he
had always been on the honor roll in High School, with a mini-

mal effort, and he figured things would work out (grade-wi'se),~

the same way.

Then one day Don’ started noticing that there weren’t many
Black people on campus. In fact, he found that he could walk
around campus /for hours, through the crowds of students and not
even see a person with a deep suntan. He also noticed that the
Black people were practically all like himself. They were from
the ghetto, yes, but their parents were not on the’ welfare, and
"they too had always been on the honor roll‘ in high school. The
Black students were all either well off, above-average in intelli-
gence, or some type of athlete. ‘

/
And he wondered just who college was supposed to be for.

And Don was confused. Life was not happy. He was in
R.O.R.C. and there was a war going on which he was beginning
to dislike. His people had being excluded and mistreated in Am-
erica for centuries. He hadn’t known itbefore, but now that he
knew ‘it, he began to realize that the dilemma of Black people
in America had not changed.

Thewhite students did notreally accept him.

Don began to wonder why he had to have his girl-friend
back in the dormitories by a certain- time. He wanted to vote.
He didn’t want anyone telling him what courses would be
beneficial for him to take. He didn’t even like the ones that he
had a choice in deciding on. He saw that to be a commuter,
was not to be a real student at the University. '

He wondered what was the use of grades.
Things hav_e changed, trying not to sound" ancient, I can

truthfully say that you have things a lot better than when I was
afreshman. '

You won’t have any language requirement. You won’t have

to take your girls back to thedormitories at any prescribed
time. You won’t have the option of taking ROTC or gym. There
might even be a girl in the room next to yours in the Towers.

- You can go through four years of college, without seeing a letter
grade on your transcript. You can dress any way you want to,
without concern for fashion or social pressures. '

Black people are here in numbers enough to assure some

sort of- strength. A Black studies program has been initiated‘, one

. of the best in the nation. Black people have a sort of autonomy,

while still keeping open channels with the school. We now con-

trol our lives instead of having them carefully drawn- out for
us, just as most white students do also. I ‘A

A greatly revised grad-
ing system will be in effect
for the College of Arts and
Sciences (CAS) this fall. The
new plan, approved by the
Faculty of Arts and Sciences
(FAS) on April 9, features a
unique credit-no entry sys-
tem.

Starting in September, CAS
Students will have the option of
taking as many courses as they
wish on the credit-no entry ba-

‘ . sis. Credit for a course will be

awarded if “at least satisfactory”
work is done; otherwise, no men-
tion of the course will be made
on the student’s transcript.

The A—F letter grade system
will be retained as the students
other option.

The purpose of the new sys-
tem is to encourage students to
take courses in unfamiliar areas
without having to worry about
getting bad grades. Courses
taken under credit-no entry do
not count in the Quality Point
Average (QPA).

Departments will have the
right to decide which or how
many of their required courses

3 for a major may be taken credit-

//

no entry. Also, departments can
choose to offer some of their
courses only on a credit-no en-
try basis.

Students must decide within
two weeks after the beginning
of a term which grading system
they wish to use for each course.

The following is the test of
the FAS decision:

Whereas

The methods of evaluation
used in undergraduate courses
are of central importance in in-
fluencing the nature and qual-
ity of the education acquired by
students.

The results of evaluation.
when properly transmitted, serve
many vital purposes, such as in-
forming students of their ability
and their progress, helping facul-
ty and others to judge the stu-
dent’s potential for further work
in specific areas, and certifying
to the university the student’s
progress toward a degree; and

A certain degree of uniformity
of practice in applying methods
of evaluation and in recording

,the results is necessary both if

these purposes are to be served

and if equity in treatment of

students is to be protected;
Therefore be it enacted that

(1) Each student shall have
a transcript recording all grades
in which credit is awarded.

(2) There shall be two op-
tions for evaluations that must
be entered on the transcript: (A)
The Letter Grade System, and
(B) The Credit-No Entry Sys-
tern.

(A) Letter Grades shall be as
follows:
: Superior attainment;
: Meritorious attainment;
: Satisfactory work;
2 Barely competent work;
: Failure to do work of even
minimal competence;
: Work incomplete, for rea-
sons beyond the student’s
control;

N: Non—credit, audit; and
W: Withdrawal from course
with no penalty and no
credit.

(B) The Credit-No Entry
Grade shall be as follows:

S: Credit awarded for at least
satisfactory work done in course.
No entry shall be made for less
than satisfactory work done in
course. Courses for whish an S
is received are not counted in

trol.

may not be changed, nor may a
grade of one kind awarded for a
course be replaced by a grade
of the other kind for that course.

(6) Eligibility for mention on
the Dean‘s List shall be restrict-
ed to students who have earned
grades of A. B, C. D, or F‘ in at
least 12 credits during the term
for which the List is published.
The criteria for actual inclusion
on the List shall be established
by the Dean of CAS.

(7) While no student can be
refused the option of taking any
course on a Credit-No Entry
Basis. departments may feel that
some of their courses are of such
a nature that they should not be
graded on the letter-grade system.
In such cases, departments, may
with the agreement of the in-
structor teaching the course. re-
quest permission from CASC to
give the course solely on a Cred-
it-No Entry Basis.

(8) Departments shall have the
option of deciding which cours-
es required for a major, if any,
may be taken on a Credit-No
Entry Basis. Since one major
purpose of the Credit-No Entry
System is to encourage students
to investigate disciplines with
which they are unfamiliar, CAS

ments to allow some freedom on
this point. Students who "have

by being led to feel that they
have made no genuine progress
toward mastering the discipline.

(9) An optional method of re-
cording evaluations shall be es-
tablished to supplement the man-
datory transcript. This method
shall be called the Portfolio
Method. Each student shall be
encouraged to accumulate a vari-
ety of kinds of'evidence of aca-
demic and personal growth and
achievement. e.g.. samples of
academic work such as term
papers, reports of experiments,
paintings, or records of musical
performances: evaluations by

various members of the academic
community. or by employers and
others who may know the stu-
dent well, etc. The student shall
determine the contents of his
portfolio and shall exercise over
its transmission to anyone out-

  
 

side the College the same com-
plete control he shall have over
the transmission of his trans-
cript. The CAS shall offer as
much aid as it can to students
in maintaining portfolios.

(10) It shall be incumbent on
faculty members to award grades
to each individual student on
the basis of the work done by
that individual in that course in
accordance with the evaluation
options provided in paragraph
two.

(11) The responsibility for
dealing with infractions of the
rules governing grading policy
by any faculty member rests. in
the first instance. on the depart-
ment to which the faculty mem-
ber belongs. Where this respon-
sibility is not adequately discharg-
ed, the Dean of-FAS shall ini-
tiate such action as may seem ap-
propriate.

Role Of The University Also Questioned

Pitfalls Of Political Activity Analyzed

by DIANNE ULYON

_The realities of national and
state politics have recently chal-
lenged the University with prob-
lems peculiar to any institution

which is dependent upon public

support for its existence.

Since the Universitys finan-
cial crisis this winter, the nation-
wide reaction to the engagement
of troops in Cambodia. and the
tragedy at Kent State. members
of the University community
have become increasingly more
aware that the institution and
those who attend it cannot ig-

nore the political environment

surrounding them. Efforts by
students. faculty. and staff dem-
onstrate that this awareness is
being channeled into debates.
programs, and action supporting
individual or institutional in-
volvement in the external politi-
cal environment.

To what extent should the Uni-
versity encourage student poli-
tical activism?

Two attempts are currently be-
ing made to faciliate contact
between students and the politi-

While the University Senate
proposals indicate faculty sup-
port for student involvement in
election politics. Michael Edel-

junior in political science. are
attempting to generate support
and finances from student. fac-
ulty. and staff agencies for aca-
demic—political program for stu-
dents.

This program is divided into
three parts: 1. a student liaison
to transmit information between
Harrisburg and the campus to
communicate the actions and
attitudes of legislators and stu-
dents between these parties.

2. A student intern program
to juxtapose reading assignments
with work in the capital to give
students an academic and‘ prac-
tical knowledge about state poli-

tics. With sufficient financing
and program control students
could receive academic credit

and serve as aides to legislators
in Harrisburg for a term.

3. Lectures and teach-ins about
state politics would become reg-
ularly scheduled events through
Student Government and/or the
Student Union.

The Office of Commonwealth
Relations, the Political Science
Department. the Office for Stu-
dent Affairs and the few stu-
dents familiar with the com-
munication difficulties between
University students and Com-
monwealth legislators have ex-
pressed verbal support for the
idea. However. without adequate
funding and co-operation be-
tween the above and other areas
of the University. students will
not see Harrisburg through this
program.

..Despite all this concern and
action to encourage student parti-
cipation in the political process-
es; a significant number of stu-

dents, faculty and administrators

seem to share the view of Ber-
nard Kobosky, the Assistant
Chancellor for Student Affairs,

do think students should get po-
litically involved.” Kobosky and
others maintained that individ-
ual political involvement should
be an ongoing concern and neith-
er limited to two or three days
of intensive campaign efforts
nor conflicting with one’s other
responsibilities.

Should the University,
educational institution,

stand on political issues?

The May 8 issue of the Pitt
News reported that a mail ballot
was sent to the Faculty of Arts
and Sciences calling for:

as
take

an

. . a condemnation of ‘the
National Guard at Kent State
University‘ and a call for the
United States to ‘unilaterally
and immediately withdraw all
forces from Southeast Asia."

In addition to this ballot. the
Presidents of Student Govern-
ment and the University Senate
flew to Washington,
meet with Pennsylvanias con-
gressional delegation regarding
the above statement. These ac-
tions.- could be interpreted as an
attempt to make an institutional
stand on a political issues.

The difficulty of dealing with
this question is, as Martin Ham-
burger pointed out. “How do you
define an institutional stand?"
While Mr. Hamburgers question
has been asked by many on this
campus, many indicate they
would consider a stand approved
through the governance bodies
which jointly represent students,
faculty and staff as legitimately
representing the University.

Beyond the problem of agree-
ing on whom may issue an insti-
tutional stand for the University
is the problem of agreeing on
the appropriate issues on which
a stand might be taken. Dr. Jer-
ome Rosenberg, dean of the Fac-
ulty of Arts and Sciences, felt
that a stand must be related to
educational issues.

“I don’t think the institution
should take a stand on matters
which do not affect its exist-
ence. . . but I can see it on
the student deferment and on

POOR,

government loan and scholar-
ship programs.”

Jack Freeman, executive assist-
ant to the Chancellor, had a dif-
ferent view:

“There are some policies that
must be institutional. . . con-
struction contracts, hiring prac-
tices, admissions. . 

He indicated that on these is-
sues the University has a respon-
sibility to take a position, but
that he viewed it less than dem-
ocratic to accept a faculty vote
which does not allow the ex-

pel people who don't agree?"

Those who hesitate to support
the issuance of an institutional
stand are concerned about the
potential problems which such
action might create. As a uni-
versity receiving one—third of
its budget from state appropri-

ations. relying on federal tax-
emption. and depending on
countless numbers of federal.

state. and private dollars to fin-
ance all phases of its program-
ming. the institution could ser-

Parking in Oakland is scarce

by PAUL HENSLER

 Commuter Association President

itttittttttttttttttitttittttttttititttttttittit

While many of this year’s new
students are learning to cope
with cafeteria food’, coin laun-
dries and idiosyncrasies of room-
mates, the majority of the Class
of ’74 will be confronted with
over-priced and scarce parking,
long waits in adverse weather
for buses seemingly guided only
by some mysticism of the stars,
inadequate lounge, snack, recre-
ation and rest facilities, expen-
sive meals ‘and a multitude of
minor irritations on campus and
at home which prevent most
commuters from achieving total
integration with the university
community.

The Pitt Commuter Associa-
tion (CA) recognizes these prob-
lems and is doing something
about them.

and expensive. The Cit_v‘s meter
maids enforce parking regula-
tions with a fervor that borders
on harassment. The Commuter
Associations is alleviating the
parking problem in two ways:
creating new parking areas and
better utilizing existing facili-
ties. The Commuter Association
is now providing parking for
Pitt students‘ behind the Carne-
gie Museum at fifty cents per
day and twenty—five cents in the
evening. In the near future, the
CA will offer additional new
parking area in Forbes Field and
on the old practice fields across
from Pitt Stadium. The Commut-
er Association encourages_better
use of existing facilities by per-
iodically conducting parking sur-
veys of Oakland and posting re-
sults on a map of Oakland pro-
vided to all commuters.

The commuter who relies on
public transportation has as ‘many
problems as the student who
drives to Oakland. Bus fare is
expensive; schedules are often in-
convenient for commuting stu-
dents and there are presently
no shelter facilities near campus.
The Commuter Association is in
constant contact with the Port
Authority and together are work-
ing on reduced college student
fare passes and more convenient

have bus shelters erected on

Fall Trimester. The Commuter
Association hopes its car pool
project will further help to alle-
viate both parking and public
transportation problems in Oak-

In order to provide commuters
with good meals at reasonable
prices. the Commuter Associa-
tion is presently negotiating with
SAGA Food Service for a com-
muters meal pass for the dorm
cafeteria.

Since the commuting student
spends many hours on campus be-
tween classes, the CA is work-
ing for improved lounge, snack,
recreation and rest facilities.
The Student Union sta-f has been
very receptive and helpful to the
CA by allowing the Commuter
Association input into present pro-
graming and plans‘ for the new
union. The CA is also working
for extended snack facilities in

locker facilities for the commut-
er who wishes to remain in Oak-

Although these problems of.
commuting are
must be considered as just ele-
ments of a much larger set of
problems, irritations and frustra-
tions, both at home and on cam-
pus which prevent most commut-g

ing students from achieving the —.

envolvement with the whole
university community needed to
obtain a complete education.

The problems are not insur-
mountable. In the past several
months, the Commuter Associa-“

tion has shown that much can _
be done to make the commyut--~

ing student part of the total Iiliii-‘
versity community. But much re-
mains to be done. The Commut-
er Association can only accomp-
lish these goals with.the‘cooper—
ation and involvement of commut-
ing students.

Fighting to Save E
Earth Day’    

A April 22 marked a time of warning. We are fowling our
‘ streams, lakes, marshes. The sea is next. We are burying our-
selves under seven million scrapped cars, 30 million tons of
waste paper, 48 billion discarded cans and 28 billion bottles
’ and jars a year. A million tons more of garbage pile up each day.
I s The air we breathe circles the earth 40 times a year, and
- America contributes 140 million tons of pollutants: -90 million
' , from cars——we burn more gasoline than the rest of the world
lcombined——-15 million from electric power generation, one—third
: of the worlds total. Lead in San Diego’s air gets deposited in lay-
ers on the Pacific. LA smog may cause mass deaths by 1975.
Scientists say that if noise continues to rise at its current rate,
' I we will be stone death by the year 2000. We already consume and
waste more than any other people. By the year 2000 the popula-
”tion of the U.S. will be double that of today—400,000,000. God
 only knows how many people will be starving then and remember
) it’s the children who usually die first. We flatten our hills, fill
our bays, blitz our wilderness. Lake Erie is dead; the Mononge—
 hela, one of Pittsburgh’s great rivers, is nearly sterile; the gov-
ernment tells us we need the SST; the use of DDT is still permit-
ted in 49 out of 50 states; the jets are coming to the Everglades
and even our nearly 148 acre Duff Park is threatened with ex-
— tinction thanks to the Pennsylvania Department of Highways;
‘ and, of course, we must not forget the great environmentalist
Walter Hickel—he’s okayed the trans-Alaska oil pipeline. Oh yes,
3 don’t forget to breathe Pittsburgh’s beautiful, clean air while at
, your orientation——courtesy of our local industries including J. &
L. and U. S. Steel and others. The quality drains from our lives:
2 I am one—twenty-millionth of a swelling megalopolis. On Earth
 Day, Americans, young and old, came together for a national
T teach-in to talk about our wrecked earth- BUT, “pollution and
: babies” did not end on April 22 . . . . . Environmental Action, a
group of fired-up college kids who coordinated the teach-in", has '
er, the talk and warning has ended,

The Fight to save  
America starts now:

ticipated in Earth Day.

' Politicians came out in favor

Corporations said, "We haven't
found the answer to pollution
' yet. But we're working on it."
And the vast majority of Amer-

 icans drove to work in their own

'lions of tons of junk and wonder-

expected to shore-up the pass-

The key to the caliber of the
offense, DePasqua explained, is
the offensive line’s blocking. If
the linemen can crash the op-
posing defensemen with the fer-
ocity that the name, Panther,
implies, then the burly backs
will be “real runners.” ‘

Guards Dan Lynn (215) and
John Simpson (230). tackles
Ernie Webster (2227). and Bruce

Bob Kuziel (222i are the Pan-
thers on the renovated offensive
line. '

Simpson is the only experienc-
ed hand in the quintet. while
the coaches consider Lynn "a

' good replacement” for graduat-

ing-guard Ed Sadowski. And.
Harkiewicz will be testing his

 skills from the opposite side of

Pitt Camaro System
gned for Season

 Redesi

After about a two-month delay,
the Pitt Camaro became a reality
on the last week-end of June.

Driver Bob Fryer. a political
science major at the University,
and the rest of his “Pitt Crew"

began final preparations for the «

Blue and Gold auto’s racing de-
but in early April. but the waiting
was caused by “several unex-
pected problems." according to
Fryer.

_~"~ “To be truthful, we had to re-
design the entire front suspension
system.” he said. “We discovered
the problem from photographs.“

-1 Thanks to a photo buff’s lens,
then, the “Pitt Crew” was able to
prevent a bad start-and possibly

an end to a season before its start ’

—and the first auto on the Trans-
American series to represent a
a University hit the track.

   
   

Q12

THE PITT CAMARO and its driver, Bob Fryer, at Daytona last March, be-

Fryer took the Camaro, bear-
ing its new colors. to a track in
Warren. Ohio, where $10 gave the
crew use of the track facility for
aday. ‘

Fryer and most of the crew en-
tered the same auto (minus the
school's colors) in the Daytona
24-hour race last March—and
saw some success. The auto had
advanced to second place after
17 hours of the race before me-
chanical difficulties forced an.
exit from the competition.

Shortly after the Daytona run-
ning, the group decided to paint
the auto Pitt’s colors, and the idea
certainly showed promise for the
publicity-minded. Any “first” is
a good publicity gimmick, but
Fryer realizes that above aver-
age driving, combined with a pol-
ished performance by the crew, is
necessary if the Camaro is to be
a success.

fore the car was painted blue and gold. The Camera is the first Trans-Am
auto representing a university. There is no University money behind the
car, but Fryer is hoping for student interest in its running.

There is no University money
behind Fryer. but he is hoping
there will be an increased stu-
dent interest in the fall. One\thing
he is planning is a movie on the
Camaro‘s Trans-Am run, which
would be filmed by David Mizell.
an area photographer.

The Pitt Camaro hasn‘t been as
fortunate where money is con-
cerned as it has been with the
photographers, however. There
have been a few financial difficul-
ties in the Camaro’s short exis-
tence.

“We lost one mechanic primari-
ly because of that,” Fryer said.
“And we couldn’t buy several
pieces of equipment we wanted.
. . . We have had little financial
snags?’ '

The crew of the Camaro could
have more financial problems
when winter arrives. Fryer has
indicated that they plan to enter
the final half of the Trans-Amer-
ican series and also race in the
National Road Racing Circuit of
the Sports Car Club of America.

11th Game
Doubtful

by ED CONLEY
Sports Editor

About a month ago Pitt Athletic Director Casimir Mys-
linski told me that he thought the nation’s ADs would be
after opponents for extra football games for the 1970 season
when the ADS met at their annual convention in Houston,
Texas. '

Myslinski returned from the meeting of the National
Association of Directors of Athletics last week with the

news that the ADs were not anxious to line—up the addi-

tional games which the NCAA now permits. And for the
first time since Myslinski first hinted that he would be
interested in adding a game to the Pitt 1970 grid schedule,
the AD revealed doubt in obtaining an opponent for a Pan-
ther eleventh game. . A

“We tried to check with some schools,” be said. “But
many of them are a little hesitantabout adding a game in
the first year. I intend to get letters out to people, though.”

Myslinski has received offers from schools who want
to play the Panthers this year, ‘but many of them are small-
er schools, and Myslinski wants to be selective. He pre-
fers a school with big-time football and a grid squad that
is basically even in quality with Pitt’s.

“The only other problem,” he mentioned, “is we have

‘to fit the game into the end of our program. And most of ‘

the ‘schools are in the snowy belt like us and want to play
down South.

“We’d be playing after ‘the Penn State game,_ too—and
that would be anti-climactic ina way.”

 Anti-clim‘actic?. Sure, but no more than it would have
been in one’s thoughts a few months ago. And Myslinski
also said a few months ago that the acquisition of Astro
Turf "for Pitt Stadium could mean a home game would be

scheduled after the Penn State encounter, which is current- T

ly the fall’s finale.

Well, the Stadium appears to be getting theartificial
grass treatment. So, what’s wrong with adding a home
game? « _ V '

‘.‘We can bring somebody in,” Myslinski answered.

“That gives us much more flexibility. But we’d' have to "
have a good day. We can’t say what the weather would
‘ be like.” '

(It does indeed sound’like _there won’t. be an eleventh
game next fall. Doesn’t ‘it? _ '
‘ it as *

There isia «betterchance for the eleventh game, though,
than there is the liklihood of two other proposals taking
form. ' ' - ”’

‘Baseball coach Bobby Lewis has been talking about

fall baseball games . at_ Pitt for the past ' few years, but
the‘ mitters ‘haven’t gone beyond work-outs in the fall;
Last year, Myslinski came close to ‘being convinced of
the feasibility of a fall baseball schedule, but there isn’t
much chance for the mitters again this tall. _ '

, “Not enough teamsdschedule fall baseball,” Mys-
'-linski said. “In our particular case we have a hard time

getting practice fields. ’But I’m not saying we’re com-
" pletely keeping it out of the picture.-’ ’ i ’ P , ‘ ‘
"The other ':plan was for two soccer.-football double"

headers. at the‘ Stadium this fall, (Myslinski appears : to be

against permanent soccer and. football lining of the Astro-l
.Tu_rf. The lines would cross «in areas, and both soccer.
, and football players could be confused. I V '

As things ‘now stand at Trees Hall, most of the facilities are
open for use only from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. weekdays. The swimming

and weekends.

’ pool is the most notable exception to this rule. It is open evenings

Those of you who (want to play basketball. paddleball and hand-
ball on weekday evenings or weekends may ask why this is so.

Basically, it is because students in sufficient numbers have,
_demonostrated to the staff that they are seriously interested in usi_ng

the pool. So, instead of com-
plaining and moaning about -
Trees Hall not being open enough,
direct your energies to informing

' Dr. Peterson of your interest in

using the building.
“The best and most practical

' method of doing this is to send

a postcard‘or letter to me at 438 A
