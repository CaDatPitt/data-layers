Firemen were called in to clean out smoke from a fire in C_.J. Barney's on Monday.

Grease fire at C.J. Barney's

By Milt Klopfer
For The Pitt News

A fire in the Oakland restaurant C.J.
Barney's on Monday disrupted the
lunch-time crowd but caused no in-
juries.

According to C.J.’s manager Sam
Rothchild a grease fire started in the

» hood above a stove and remained

confined to the kitchen. _

”I pulled the Ansol system, got
everyone out and grabbed an ex-
tinguisher and went at it,” Rothchild

said. _
The Ansol system is a chemical
sprinkler system that many

restaurants have installed for similar
emergencies.

After putting the fire out, Rothchild
called the fire department. Engines
10, 11 and" 14 of the McKee‘and
Louisa Street fire station responded
to the call.

According to Lt. Rade Malkovich,
the firemen used equipment to blow
the smoke out of the restaurantand
checked the rafters to see if the fire

..disrupts lunchtime patrons

had spread there.
Fire inspector Ralph Jedrzejwski of
the City Public Safety Office said the

damage was basically in the duct—.
work and the appliances of the kitch- _

en. The chemical sprinkler system
will have to be reset before the
restaurant can reopen.

According to Rothchild, the bar
portion of the establishment remains
open. _-

”We expect to reopen [the
restaurant] in a couple of days,
hopefully by Wednesday,” he said.

— Letter to The Pitt News
Sept. 26, 1986

I wanted to see for myself.

I arrived at the police station in
Forbes Quad a little before 3 pm".
Monday. The officers on the 3-11

p.m. shift were starting to come in for -
roll call.

Shift commander James Chester
stood at the podium and read the
events" of the previous shifts.

After roll call, the officers made
their way to the communications
room to pick up their radios. From
here, it was off to the beat.

The officer with whom I was
assigned, John Kiefer, didn't come on
duty until 4 p.m., so I walked the first
hour with Officer John Shamlin.

Officer Shamlin is assigned to Post
3, the area including the Towers, the
Quad and the student union.

Before we could get’out on the
street, we werecalled to escort a lady
from the union to Thackeray Hall.

At 3:36 we were back in our
assigned area and on patrol. We
walked through the Towers and the
Quad. Nothing was happening.

I was with Officer Shamlin until
4:23, at which time I was picked up
by Officer Kiefer in car 2-1. This car
is assigned to patrol the lower cam-
pus. We are on ’’the track.”

Part of the lower campus car's
duties is to check certain buildings.
At 4:28, we checked the fine arts
building, and at 4:59 we drove by the
Forbes-Craig Apartments. Everything
looked fine. V

Once again we were back on

A patrol. Just the simple fact of driving

    Posvar meets with
NCAA committee,

 
 

to cut back on

athletic Programs

By Matthew Thornton
Staff Writer

President Wesley Posvar is attend-
ing a conference in Kagsas City to
propose changes in NCAA guidelines
for the college athletic programs.

Posvar represents the university on
an ad hoc committee of presidents
who are making recommendations
for the NCAA policy meeting in
January.

If the proposal is accepted, there
will be cutbacks in the athletic pro-
grams at Pitt.

The proposed cutbacks are: reduc-
ing the number of football scholar-
ships from 90 to 85 over the next
three years, reducing the full-time
coaching staff‘from seven to eight and
cutting the basketball and baseball
roster and season.

”I support them [the proposed cuts]
100 percent," said Pitt athletic direc-

_‘ tor Edward B,o,zik.g”The__cuts _in the 
schedules would allow the athletes _

more time for their academic pursuits
and reduce the costs in the athletic
department.”

”I also want to reaffirm the com-
mitment to Proposition48,” Posvar
said yesterday.

Proposition 48 requires that any
freshman athlete maintain a
minimum 2.0 QPA and carry at least
11 academic core subjects.

Posvar was a member of a select
committee on athletics that par-
ticipated in what Bozik called the
”real genesis of Proposition 48.”

Posvar also said a study was done
at Pitt according to the NCAA stan-
dards. The results showed that 84
percent of all gvarsity athletes
graduate. Posvar said that the gradua-
tion rate for football players was
about the same as the graduation rate
for athletes overall. Posvar compared
this to the 67 percent of all Pitt
students who graduate.

Posvar’s committee will also sub-
mit a proposal to limit the amount of
time and money a school can spend
on recruiting.

Pitt football coach Mike Gottfried
sees the cuts as detrimental to the
school and the program. ’’I’m against

around, making your presence
known, is a deterrent.

The time is now 5:05. The radio
calls for car 2-1 to go to the Forbes-
Craig Apartments to take a report.
When we arrived, we met the custo-
dian and a tenant. The tenant's apart-
ment had been burglarized. Officer
Kiefer took the report and notified the
shift commander. Commander
Chester arrived and surveyed the ex-
terior of the apartment. At this point
the two officers, along with the vic-
tim, the custodian and myself,
entered the apartment and looked for
what had been taken. ’ I
 Officer Kiefer was told to remain

all three of them [the cuts" in players,
coaches and practice time]. I hope
they all stay. the same,” he said. ’’If
there have to be cuts, I'd rather see
them _in the recruiting program.”

”With spring pract_ice, the players . Q, 

have theopportunity to improve all

Year, both individually and as a F ' 

team,” Gottfried said.

- Asked whether he thought the

spring practices cut too deeply into
the study time of the students, he
said, ”T-hose practices only amount
to eight hours a week; that still leaves,
a lot of time for classes.”

”The present cuts in the coaching  A
staff have hurt the profession in the ’
past. I feel there is a need for those V

people,” he said. ”I respect [Dr.]
Posvar and [Dr.] Bozik’s judgment,
but I think there are better places to
make the cuts,” Gottfried concluded.

“There is enormous pressure on
the teams to win," Bozik said. ’’I
think most of those pressures are
economic. It could lead to academic

problems and lowering of integrity. ‘

’’I certainly don't see those things
as problems now,” Bozik empha-s

sized._ ’’If I did, we [the administra-‘ »  

tion] wouldn't be doing our jobs.”

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, October I, I986

Daniloff freed;pre-summitmeeting in Iceland

WASHINGTON — The Soviet
Union released U.S. News and
World Report correspondent

Nicholas Daniloff Monday as part of
a ”spy swap” that includes the
release of an accused Soviet spy.

Daniloff left Moscow on a flight to
Frankfurt, then spent the day relax-
ing. Tuesday morning, he boarded a
flight to the United States and at press
time was on his way home.

Accused Soviet spy Gennady
Zakharov was released Tuesday after
pleading ”no contest” to spying
charges, a move President Reagan in-
sists was not in any way.related to the
Soviets releasing Daniloff.

Instead, Reagan said, the United
States is trading Zakharov for a Soviet
dissident, Yuri Orlov, who has been
mistreated by the Soviets over the
years, and is in poor health.

Orlov will be released sometime in
the next two weeks.

Reagan also said the Soviet’s
release of Daniloff has enabled him
to agree to a pre-summit meeting
with Soviet leader Mikhail Gor-
bachev in Reykjavik, Iceland on Oct.
11 and 12.

Many reports coming from

‘Washington seem to contradict the
‘president though. Many reporters,

quoting ”high level administration
sources,” said a deal involving

Daniloff and Zakharov was struck,
with the president refusing to public-
ly admit it.

On the ABC-TV news program
Night/ine Monday night, ABC

I reporterJohn McQuethy said that his

sources told him a deal involving
Daniloff and Zakharov was definite-
ly struck, but that President Reagan
would vehemently deny such a thing
on Tuesday morning.

Reagan also would not say whether
the United States will be receiving
any more dissidents as part of the
deal.

Israel charges

Demjanjuk

JERUSALEM — Israeli prosecutors
Monday formally charged retired
U.S. autoworker John Demjanjuk
with torturing prisoners at a Nazi
death camp and operating gas
chambers in which hundreds of
thousands of Jews were killed.

According to the 26-page indict-
ment, Demjanjuk committed crimes
”of incomparable severity” while he
was a guard at the Treblinka death
camp in Poland during World War
II, including: stabbing prisoners, cut-
ting off the ears of prisoners, whip-

ping prisoners and tearing off pieces
of flesh from live prisoners.

Demjanjuk came to America in
1952 but was found guilty of lying
about his Nazi past and eventually
had his U.S. citizenship revoked in
1981. Israeli authorities managed to
have him extradited to Israel six
months ago.

If convicted, Demjanjuk could
receive the death penalty. He will be
the first person tried in Israel on
charges of Nazi war crimes since
Adolph Eichman who was convicted
and hanged in 1962.

Heavy rains
plague midwest

OKLAHOMA CITY — Heavy rains
pounding the heart of the nation
forced scores of people in Oklahoma
and Illinois to evacuate their homes
Tuesday morning. And forecasters are
calling for more rain to hit Wednes-
day and Thursday.

Up to six inches of rain have fallen
on Oklahoma City and other parts of

the state since the weekend, and
authorities reported that several tor-
nados touched down in the south-
eastern part of Oklahoma City
Monday night.

In Illinois, flood waters have
devastated many homes and
businesses, and the governor has
declared several cities disaster areas.

Still no sign of l
deadly fugitive

WRIGHT CITY, Missouri — Hun-
dreds of heavily armed police con-
tinued one of the most intensive
manhunts in Missouri history Tues-
day, combing through the rugged ter-
rain where they believe Michael
Wayne Jackson may be hiding.

Jackson, a former mental patient

‘prone to violence, is accused of go-

ing on a three—state crime spree last
week, including the murders of three
people and the kidnappings of five
others, who have since been released
unharmed.

Police thought that they had found
Jackson's hiding place Monday night,
but a raid on an abandoned farm-
house turned up nothing.

House overrides
Reagan veto

WASHINGTON — In a major
defeat for President Reagan, the
House voted late Monday night to
override his veto of punitive
economic sanctions against the white

_ minority government of South Africa.

The’ Senate is expected to follow
suit sometime soon.

The 313-83 vote easily defeated a
last-ditch effort by the president to
sustain his veto by proposing to
toughen the limited sanctions he had
already endorsed. But, those sanc-
tions were not nearly as stringent as
those passed by the House. One con-
gressional spokesman said the sanc-
tions approved by the House take the
United States ”close to total divest-
ment.”

The battle now moves to the
Senate, where Senate Majority Leader
and Republican Senator Robert Dole
has admitted that finding the
necessary votes to sustain Reagan's
veto will be tough. In order to sus-
tain the veto, 34 Senators must vote
for it, otherwise the tough new
sanctions-bill will become law.

Will it happen again?

Police deter weekend violence

By Christopher Sepesy
Staff Writer

”Finally something is being done,”
said Mark Mazziotti about this
weekend's police" crackdown on the
”weekend war zone” on the corner
of Forbes Avenue and Bouquet
Street, so deemed because of gang
violence there on Saturday, Sept. 20.

”That weekend I saw what is prob-
ably the most violent thing I have
ever seen,” Mazziotti said. ’’I was in
McDonald's when this gang came in.
Before anyone knew it, they had two
people knocked out cold on the floor.
And the worst part about it is nobody
could do anything about it because
there were just so damn many of
them.”

Because of incidents like these last
weekend, both campus and city
police have initiated a crackdown.
This past weekend, both city and
campus police were out in force
patrolling the streets of Oakland.

”We added an additional 25 men
last Friday and Saturday,” said Pitts-
burgh police Sgt. David‘Allman. ”We
were especially concerned on Satur-
day because of the Pitt-WVU game,
but things went fine. Whether or not
they stay that way, well, only time
will tell.” .

According to Allman, the addi-
tional manpower for Oakland will
continue at least through the whole
month of October, longer if needed.
Once cooler weather sets in,
however, the crowds hanging out
usually disperse, Allman said.

Allman attributed the cause of the
previous weekend's violence to a

high school football game between
Schenley High and Taylor-Allderdice
High. After the game, the crowds, as
well as city street gangs, began pour-
ing into Oakland.

”On Fridays and Saturdays, Pitts-
burgh basically shuts down. Oakland

“_

They should stop
playing politics with
the safety of the peo-
ple of Pittsburgh.

— Sid Simon

is the happening place to be. Along
with the college crowds pouring in,
you also get the thieves, punks and
rabble—rousers,” Allman said. ”This
is not a new situation. It's just that
now it has gotten a little out of con-
trol.”

Sid Simon, owner of The Original
Hot Dog Shop, agrees with Allman
on this point.

”There is more to the story than
vio|ence,” Simon said.”This has been
going on for the past three or four
years, only now the situation is out
of control. This didn't start last week,
though.”

Simon said the police officers who
were out patrolling and who con-
tinue to patrol are doing a good job.
But, he said he is furious over the
closing of Oakland's Police Station
No. 4, which will move to Squirrel
Hill in a few weeks.

”There are nine precincts in the
city;‘ now they are cutting down to

five,” Simon said. ”Oak|and is the
hottest area in the city. It gets the third
most calls in Pittsburgh. How in the
hell can they even justify taking [Sta-
tion No.] 4 out and putting it in Squir-
rel Hill?

”Sure, the mayor lives in Squirrel
Hill, as do some of the council
members, but does this mean that the
people in‘ Oakland, including the
students, are less important?”

Simon said that what he would like
to do now is take out a full page ad
in The Pitt News to explain to the city
administration exactly how he feels.

”What I would like to let them
know is that they should stop play-
ing politics with the safety of the peo-
ple of Pittsburgh,” he said. ”One
thing you don't mess around with in
politics is law and order." ,

”The Pitt News named it and
named it right — it is a war zone.
What in the hell is wrong with them,
can't they read?”

Simon said he is convinced that the
recent bad publicity caused by the
violence is going to be detrimental to
certain businesses in Oakland.

”Nobody is going to want to come
here anymore,” he said. ”My place
[The Original] will survive. We are
basically a legend around here. But
I feel sorry for some of the other
smaller places. If this goes on, they're
not going to be able to take it.”

Simon said the violence is not be-
ing caused by students or residents
of Oakland, but by outsiders who
come into Oakland for the weekend
nights. ‘

”.|t’s not our kids, it's the ones who
come from outside of Pittsburgh
thinking they can take over the city
in a night,” he said.

Student government

board candidates  
officially begin, I

campaigning today”

By Milt Klopfer

For The Pitt News

This year's student government
election process officially begins to-
day at noon. During this week — the
petition period — potential can-
didates for Student Government
Board offices may apply to campaign.

According to its constitution, the
SGB consists of a president and eight
board members who are all elected
in an- at-large election.

The board functions as both an ex-
ecutive and legislative body whose
goals are ”to promote the concerns,
interests, needs andwelfare of all
undergraduate students of the univer-
sity,” according to the 1986-87 Stu-
dent Organizations Handbook.

Among the board's responsibilities
are the allocation of the student ac-
tivities fee, freshmen orientation and
the leadership conference.

The at-large election is a campus-
wide event conducted during the sec-
ond week in November. Every under-'
graduate student at Pitt has the right

"to vote in this election. An elections
committee, appointed by the Student .

Governmentjudiciary, runs the elec-
tion, making sure that it is fair and ef-
ficient. ‘

According to the elections commit-
tee chairman Jeff Carpenter, to
become a candidate one must pick
up and complete a petition form

packet at the Student Government{..«
Office. The packet consists of a can- ..
didate application form, a campaign - .'--'5_
staff list form, a campaign expense. -.79:-‘

form and a petition form.
The completed petition form must

have the signatures of persons who  
support the applicant’s candidacyg ‘ 

The number of signatures required for

board applicants is 100. Presidential

applicants must secure 150‘
signatures.

An essay is also required of the ap— ..
plicant, giving the reasons why he or -

she wants to hold.the particular of-

fice and what his or her goals are. . ’
The packet must be completed and .  
turned in to the Student Government’

Office by the Wednesday, Oct. 8.
The applicants who are designated '
candidates attend an o_rientation on

Oct. 20, and campaigning begins two V

days later.

According to Carpenter, it is dif- '” 
ficult to predict the applicant  
response. Last year, only two persons ‘ , 
applied for the presidency and only i

11 applied for the eight board posi-
tions. -

’’I think that [students] should run ,
if they feel they can contribute’

something to their government and
their school,” Carpenter said.

Persons interested in becoming‘
candidates or in the election itself
should contact the Student Govern-
ment Office.

Why is the SGB
so quiet at Pitt?

The current Student Government Board is gradually winding down
its year in office. The elections for the new board are fast approaching.
In a few weeks, promises to fight student apathy, vows to get Pitt
out of.South Africa and declarations that students have to be more
involved in the workings of the university, will be heard all over cam-
pus. SGB elections are run with the same tired promises every year,
and every year most of them go unfulfilled. Why is that? .

Take the current board as an example. It seems to be the most silent
one in recent years. At least the previous boards made the paper on
a fairly regular basis and gave the impression that they were actually
doing something constructive. Aside from the usual time consuming
tasks of allocation of student activity fee funds, organizing commit-
tees and resume padding, what has the current board done to make
itself noteworthy? What issues has it embraced? And what kinds of
changes has it made to address those issues?

This column is not an attack. It is simply asking questions of an
organization which is supposed to represent the students. It could
be, and most likely is, doing its job. But the students don't know that
because they haven't been informed of what it is the SGB has done
since last January. Perhaps if President Mumma called regular press
conferences with the student media, these questions would never

"have to be asked.

So SGB, take out some ads in the paper. Get some time in on the
radio station. Let us know what you've been up to. The entire stu-
dent body is waiting to see some answers and some concrete evidence
of progress.

The Daniloff case
is finally resolved

The Soviet Union released the accused spy and American journalist
Nicholas Daniloff on Monday, Sept. 29. On Tuesday, Sept. 30, the
United States released the proven spy Gennadi Zakharov. Though

« no formal charges were brought against Daniloff, Zakharov pleaded
no contest in a three-minute proceeding on Tuesday, thus admitting
his guilt. Yet he's still been released,

The Reagan administration and the Soviet Union still maintain that
there was no connection and definitely not any type of ”spy swap”
involved in the two releases. But who's kidding whom here? Is
preserving Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev’s pride more im-

- portant than telling the truth? .

_As of Tuesday, the official word was that the Soviet Union was also
releasing a number of dissident citizens such as Yuri Orlov, a human
rights activist. Also disclosed on Tuesday were official plans for a
Reagan-Gorbachev summit to be held in'Reykjavik, Iceland, on Oct.

'11 andl2, 1986.

It's extremely obvious that we traded Zakharov for Daniloff. De-
nying it just makes us look worse than we already do in the eyes
of the rest of the world. But at least we're not alone. The Soviet Union
looks just as bad. Even though the trade — that everyone keeps de-
nying — looks as if it could be very profitable for both sides. They
are getting rid of some of their dissidents, and that will lessen ac-
cusations about their human rights record. And now that the big ”bat—
tle of the wills” is over, Reagan and Gorbachev can meet for a summit
without compromising one another’s pride.

Evidently the rules of international relations dictate that a leader
must stand by his original story no matter how foolish he looks. In
this case, how foolish they look.

This situation could have escalated even further than it did if some
type of bargain weren't arranged. Is it so bad to admit it? The world
may never find out exactly what happened-between the Kremlin and
the White House over the past few weeks. But as long as Nicholas
Daniloff has returned home, the road to a summit has been made
a little more smooth, and hopefully, relations between the United
States and the Soviet Union will improve. The particulars in this matter
lose their significance. I

Bicentennial problems

Like it or not, the Pitt Bicentennial
is here. We cannot escape from the
bicentennial logo anywhere on cam-
pus. |t’s in the Book Center, stadium
and even the stationery...Sure, the
university has its right to celebrate its
200th birthday. But common sense
was lost in making Pitt's bicentennial
goods

For me, it started at the Book
Center. A week before the fall term
started, I bought some spiral- bound,
single-folder notebooks there. Of
course, they had the bicentennial
logo on them. A week later, I went
to place a regular 8‘/2 x 11 sheet of
paper in one of the notebooks. To my
disgust, the folder inside was too nar-
row to fit the sheet. Not enough
thought was put into the design. To
[the] man or woman [who's] respon-
sible, I understand that Rax is hiring
for day shifts.

Another ”bicentennialism” hit me
when I was notified of the date of my
first exam of the term. I went to write
down the note on my Pitt Program
Council Bicentennial Calendar. Sure,
the calendar looks really nice this
year with its classic black and gold
coloring and its shiny paper. Hey, it's

LETTERS

the bicentennial! But because of the
nice, shiny paper, you cannot write
on it. I've tried pencil, pen, marker
and even crayon. But alas, all of this
was to no good. I'm sure less PPC
calendars are being hung around
campus this year_ due to this
oversight.

It seems to me that these and prob-
ably other goods for‘Pitt’s bicenten-
nial were rushed into production.

No excuses

My name is Bart Miller, and I am
a white student at the University of
Pittsburgh. This letter is a rebuttal to
previous letters that offered excuses
for the violence on Oakland streets.
The simple fact is that university
students are being assaulted by black
hoodlum teenagers. Maybe students
should heed the advice of the rap
group Houdini, The freaks come out
at night, if you want to live a nice

quiet life, do yourself a favor, don ’t
come out at night. '

Lack of programs for the city's
youth along with the influence of rap
music are both poor and exhausted
excuses for the actions of these
”bums." I grew up in the same
”disadvantaged social environment”
and attended high school in a ”disad-
vantaged black neighborhood.” The
prison-school is now closed due to
declining enrollment and deterio-
rating facilities; it was over 80 years
old. Although the programs and facil-
ities in Pittsburgh's schools and parks
are inferior to most suburban.pro-
grams, one can take advantage of that
which is offered by the city. In other
words, there are many successful and
non-violent people originating from
disadvantaged environs.

Some negative reinforcement such
as a night in jail and a heavy fine
might persuade these losers to stay off
of the streets; maybe even [to] get a
part-time job. Wait, I'm sorry, I got
carried away, there are not jobs for
black youths in today's racist society.

Crime’s not a racial issue

My desk has been simply overﬂow-
ing with very angry and equally in-
flammatory letters to the editor over
this past week and a half. This
”weekend war zone” situation has
created quite the stir. People, black
and white, have seized this oppor-
tunity to make a racial issue out of
something that really doesn't have to
be that way.

The letters are virtually inter-
changeable. The format rarely varies.
It generally doesn't matter if the
writer is black or white. All of them
smack of the same racist ideas. This
is ridiculous and it is extremely
counterproductive. The fact of this
situation is: there were a few gangs
who happened to be black, who hap-
pened to assault a few students, who
happened to be white. Big deal, it
happens all of the time. Seizing this
opportunity to air your racist sen-
timents is wrong. Writing nasty let-
ters to the editor, and of course,

asking to have your name withheld, ’

is no way to improve either the local
crime rates, or racial interaction at
Pitt. This entire situation has gotten
completely out of hand. .

How can anyone make it better?
For starters, you can stop using the
exaggerated crime rates as a way to

 

PAIII. ANA1'iEiz

prove all black people are thieves,
and you can stop using the people
who do feel this way to try to prove
that all whites hate blacks. Everyone
knows that both of those examples
are prejudicial and wrong. But, there
are too many people who still believe
they are true. '
Racism is a cancer. It can and is
destroying the unity of our communi-
ty. Like cancer, it does its job very
slowly and at the same time very

' thouroughly unless it's stopped ear-

ly. If the letters from the past week
and a half are any indication, Pitt has

a terminal case.

The only way to rid ourselves of
this plague is to approach each situa-
tion on an individual basis. When
you see a group of fraternity brothers
don't think, ”they hate _me because
of my color.” When you see a group
of drunks on Forbes Avenue on a Fri-
day night don't think, ”Oh, they're
all like that.” Take them for what
they're worth — in the afore-
mentioned examples — very little.
Don't include the entirerace of the
parties involved when making your

‘own judgements and stereotypes.

Stereotyping is not wrong in itself.
We all do it to an extent. It's when
those stereotypes interfere with the
way we view the world that trouble
starts. If the students at this fine
university can straighten out their
ideas regarding racial stereotypes, I'm
sure that we can, not to sound trite,
make this a better place for everyone.
And it can happen. Everything that
happens around here does not have
to be divided along the lines of a
”Black issue” or a ”White issue.”
So please, think before you judge.
Remember that the people who do
things you consider to be wrong are
by no means representative of their
entire race — white or black.

It

Just after dinnertime the other
evening, Coffman Shenk, 95, the
world's oldest Fuller Brush man,
returned to his home near Gettys-.
burg, Pa.

Shenk, who started with the Fuller
Brush Co. in 1922, had been going
door-to—door on his "route for five
hours. He was wearing a dark blue
sat. ”Wearing proper clothes is im-
portant for any person who deals
with the public and wishes to keep
up his self—respect," he said.

Shenk’s territory is Pennsylvania's
Adams County. "He will call on
customers in the afternoon and ear-
ly evening and then spend the hours
until bedtime doing his bookkeeping.

”The job is. not a great deal dif-
ferent than it was in the '20s," he
said. ”One of the differences I do see
is that people have more money to
buy things. When I started, deliver-

ing the products was often a harder -

ta'§:3'than selling them. Because when
I came back to deliver them, a lot of
the time people wouldn't have the
money to pay for the products. You
don't see that so much now. There
is more money in circulation."
One problem remains: getting in-
side the customer's house in the first

Being an editor at The Pitt News
requires me to attend editorial
meetings. At these meetings, we
discuss several aspects of the
newspaper, such as its layout, sub-
jects for stories and mistakes we've.
made.

I left one meeting brimming with
new story ideas, but these ideas need-
ed reflection. They needed time to
ferment. Idecided that I needed to
atignd another meeting.

So I strolled over to Peter's Pub. I
thought to myself, ”Oh, I'll just stop

I in for one drink.” (l.am a compulsive

liar when it comes to Peter's.) There,
I found the inspiration I needed to get
my thoughts together and to write a
good piece of editorial columning. (If
this is to be truly good, I have to coin
at least one word — after all, Buckley
does.)

Anyway, the inspiration wasn't a
Michelob Light. It was the guy sitting
on my left at Peter's. He and I started
tfggking about Pittsburgh, the weather
and Vanna White — all things that
any person on the road to intellectual
truth usually discusses.

After the preliminaries, we moved
on to topics which needed solutions.
Little did we know that we were em-
barking on a discussion that would
take us to last call.

We talked about all of the really
important stuff in life. I told him how
I hate really tight jeans on girls, along

Q. I have been inla sexual relation-
ship with my boyfriend’ for four years.
It has been great. I do enjoy it and
feel completely satisfied, or have felt
that way until recently. For about
three months I have not been in the
mood or having orgasms. And what
makes this upsetting is that now he
tiéants us to get married.

A. In almost every long-standing
relationship there comes a time when
the sex seems to be diminishing. It's
not something to panic about. With
attention it will come back, some-
times just with a little patient waiting.
But I hear something special here —
this is happening just when he is ask-
ing you to think about a more per-
manent commitment. Sometimes this
has an inhibiting effect on the part-

always the female sex partner press-
ing the male for more commitment!
You may not be ready to make that
big decision yet.

place. From the very beginning of the
Fuller Brush Co.’s 80-year history,
that was the ultimate challenge.

”I've been here so long that getting
in the front door is fairly easy for me
now,” he said. ”My customers know
me. You try to keep yourself present-
able and polite, and you make sure
that you don't do anything in the area
that will give yourself a bad reputa-
tion.” ‘

Still, there are certain tricks that a
good Fuller Brush man uses to per-
suade a person to let him in.

”We have always offered a free gift
to the person who opens the door,”
Shenk said..”Usually it is a small
brush. It can be used as a vegetable
brush or a little scrub brush. Some
people, though, prefer a spatula.”

It has been years since the Fuller
Brush Co. limited its products to
brushes. Now the firm offers a varie-
ty of household products — too
many, in fact, for a salesperson to
carry all at one time.

”Right now, we don't carry the
sample case that we used to," Shenk
said. "You should have seen that case
— it was as big as a suitcase. Today
we carry a shoulder bag. And I do
most of my selling through a small il-

 ldage doesn't have to

lustrated brochure that. I take with
me."

One thing hasn't changed — as a
Fuller Brush man, even the oldest
one in the world, Shenk is responsi-
ble not only for taking orders but also
for getting the merchandise to the
customers once it is shipped from
headquarters. "I mail in my orders
every two weeks,” he said. ”Then,
when the products are delivered to
my house, I get in my car and take
"them to the customers."

Every Fuller Brush salesperson has
his or her own favorite product. With
Coffman Shenk, it is the feather-

me that he hates warm beer. I told
him that I hate soggy Cap’n Crunch.

We rounded a bend and zoomed’

into the area of our university and its
problems. How can our institution of
higher learning condone the Rev.
Louis Farrakhan coming to Pitt to
speak while forbidding the Greeks at
Pitt to have a charity event in the
same facility? Puzzling, isn't it? We
delved deeper. Well, we pondered,
the BAS sponsored Louis Farrakhan,
and it's the IFC and Panhellenic
Council who want to sponsor a chari-
ty pro wrestling match. Does the BAS
have so much more pull than these
other organizations? We didn't know.

Both the Greek system and the BAS
are members of the ”big five.” These
are student organizations that get the
most funding allocated to them. The
black population at Pitt is reported to
be small yet significant, and the
Greeks make up an important part of
our student population. The Greeks
aren't even asking for funding, just a
facility. So don't the Greeks have any
pull? What's really the issue here,
anyway? Are people scared of pro

wrestling? Or, do some of the univer-
sity governing boards, one in par-
ticular, just give in to the BAS
because it's the BAS? C'mon now,
the BAS is a reputable organization,
and racial bias is supposed to have
no place in our enlightened environ-

There are two things to keep in

You don't need to have glamour[ous]

’’It weighs only three or four
pounds,” he said. "I recommend it
to all my customers. It is very light
and easy to use, and it does excellent
work. It generates static electricity,
and that provides a magnetic pull to
the dirt on the carpet.

”I’ll operate it myself in the
customer's home. I don't have to get
down on my hands and knees —- the
featherweight carpet sweeper has a
wooden handle. After I've operated
it, I'll show the customer all the dirt
that has been picked up. The custom-
ers are always impressed by the dirt.”

Even though, at 95, Shenk has be-
come about as familiar in a com-
munity as a Fuller Brush man can
become, he does not always socialize
when he visits a customer. ‘

”With some of them, we'll more or
less socialize and engage in a general
conversation," he said. ”But many
people are only interested in seeing
the products I have to offer. I'll just
go into the house and show them
what I have, and they'll order, and I'll
leave, and that will be that.”

Shenk does not- work full-time
anymore, but he is proud of the
orders he brings in. ”In a recent two-

Mumma, was the person contacted
to answer some standard questions
for the survey. First of all, the paper
misspelled our illustrious leader's
name. So they called him ”Numma;”
we knew who they meant. He an-
swered questions about the student
population's favorite things to do at
Pitt and about the campus at-
mosphere in general. He answered
nobly, but I must question his
sources. An example will clarify my
point. He said that Pitt students’
favorite musical group was Genesis.
Now whom did Jim consult for this
answer? He certainly didn't ask me,

-and I was hurt. I asked around, and

Genesis came out no more popular
than anybody else, but that's OK.

So why this vicious attack on the
SGB? My friend and I didn't know
why, but just that they should do
something. Take Mr. Mumma. He
gets-to put that he was the Student
Government's president on his
resume. That, in itself, is pretty im-
pressive, especially at a major univer-
sity like Pitt. But what has he actually
done while he was at the helm?

Go back to the Greeks and their at-

One modern frustration is that '

many people have gotten out of the
habit of buying from door-to-door
salespeople. They don't trust the
whole idea.

"That's the problem," Shenk said.

”You have to make your own way,

A lot of people like to do their buy-
ing in stores; they just prefer it that
way. So you have to work hard at
making yourself accepted.

"Every Fuller Brush man more or
less creates his own image. If he's
honest and dependable and friendly,

he soon develops a stature in his,

community.‘ People don't mind let-

Shenk is reluctant to talk about
plans for the future. "At 95, it's best
not to make plans," he said. "If you
start thinking about the years to
come, you lose sight of the fact that
there might not be any.”

Nevertheless, as far as the im-
mediate future is concerned, he will
remain a Fuller Brush man.

”I’m not an expert at anything,” he
said. '’I have to work for what I get."

SGB and lobby the committee to
reverse its decision which denied the
Greeks the use of the Field House for

_by this point, and moved on to the
next issue.

This last discussion really tired us
out, so we moved to a lighter topic,
the‘ Golden Girls. What's the priori-
ty problem? We could see none.
These girls go out and have fun at
halftime during football games. I hap-
pened to get some information from
a former Golden Girl. Thefact that
she was a former Golden Girl may
have tainted her story, but I told my

bar pal anyway. I told him she».

claimed that the Golden Girls wear
falsies and .gird|es and have ‘outfits

comments about dance and twirling

them for something. I agreed. But '

who cares about such petty matters
anyway? They're out there to have a

think of more than football.

It is the way we women like men to

If that is what you have in mind, we
are talking about something else. I
take it you are feeling some resistance

‘ that she has expressed in words or by

pulling away or pushing you away.

Now, whether she is a virgin or
not, don't pressure her to go to bed.
You let her know how you feel about
wanting sex with her, and let her re-
ply to that. Listen to what she says.
She won't say it just to put up con-
ventional resistance nor to make you
feel frustrated — it will be what she
means, about what she feels, and you
have to listen to ‘that. If you love her,
and she says maybe someday, or
some night, maybe on a wedding
night, you have to be able to wait.

Retired general
calls for solution to
Arab—Israeli   conflict
via Palestinians

' By Frances Sansig

Staff Writer

Yesterday, retired Major General
Mattityahu Peled, formerly with
Israeli Defense Forces, discussed
possible strategies for an Israeli-
Palestinian proposition.

”There can be no further progress
[on Israeli-Arab relations] until the
Palestinian problem is dealt with,”
said Peled, founder of the Israeli
Council for Israeli-Palestinian Peace
in 1975.

Peled said that in 1974, the Palesti-
nians were excluded from the Israel-
Arab peace negotiations which
resulted in the Camp David accords
between Israel and Egypt.

”They weren't recognized as part
of the problem,” said Peled. He pur-
ports that the matter of a Palestinian
homeland is at the root of the Israeli-
Arab conflict.

”Our problems with the rest of the
Arab world,” said Peled, referring to
Israel, ”are not insurmountable, ifwe
can only solve the Palestinian prob-
lem.’’

Peled proposed that, in order to
resolve the Palestinian problem,

negotiations would be necessary to
regain certain disputed territories that
were taken over by Israel in the 1967
six-day war.

Peled’s proposition has. been
receiving favorable public support
since 1984, when he was elected in-

_to the Knesset Israel's governing

body.

The resettlement of the disputed
territories by the Palestinians would
have to be enforced by both the
United States and the Soviet Union,
according to Peled. ”Some people
wonder, whyvbring the Soviets in.
Nobody has to ask to bring the
Soviets in; the Soviets are there,” he
said.

Peled said that Syria, South Yemen,
Ethiopia and Libya are all within the
Soviet sphere of influence. ”Nearly
all of the'Arab nations are aligned
with the United States or with the
Soviets,” said Peled.

Peled spoke at an assembly spon-
sored by the Middle East Forum of
Pittsburgh. He holds a Ph.D. from
UCLA in Arabic studies. In addition
to his duties in the Knesset, he is a
professor of Arabic Studies at Tel Aviv
University.

fellowships.

Designed to increase the
number of underrepresented

fellowships will provide higher
education opportunities for U.S.
citizens who are American In-

Coalition for Lit

seminar addresses

By Mike Lucci
For The Pitt News

Imagine not being able to read.

Ifyou couldn't read, you wouldn't
be able to learn from a textbook, to
enjoy a novel, tohread an instruction
manual or a bank statement.

According to Alice Scales of the
School of Education, nearly 40
million people in America and one
billion in the world are illiterate. In
Allegheny County alone, there are
180,000 illiterate people. -

A seminar ‘entitled ”Literacy at
Home and Abroad: Social _and
Political Issues’’ on Monday night ad-
dressed the issue of illiteracy both in
Allegheny County and all over the
world. The seminar marked Interna-
tional illiteracy Week, which con-
tinues until Friday

Shir|eyBiggs and Mary Bruder co-
chaired the seminar sponsored by the
School of Education and the Depart-
ment of General Linguistics in con-
junction with the Coalition for Adult
Literacy.

Biggs and Bruder, along with Tom
Staszewski, president of the Coalition
for Adult Literacy, were presented
with proclamations from the

problems of illiterate  
at home and abroad  

Allegheny County Department of Ad-
ministration honoring their service to
the problems of the illiterate.

Dr. Seth Spaulding, an Interna-

tional Education Professor, spoke on C 
the international perspective of

literacy. He praised the campaign
work of UNESCO, but added that the
United States and the United

Kingdom were no longer members of 

this campaign committee.

He stressed the fact that literacy
campaigns must not be a ”flash in the
pan," but should be consistent so that
once people become even semi-
literate, they will not relapse back in-
to illiteracy.

Pittsburgh city council memberil

Michelle Madoff said she was com-_

mitted to raising money for literacy ,

campaign funds.
Madoff suggested that radio sta-

tions offer prizes to callers with the..

correct responses to questions con-
cerning correct grammatical sentence
structures.

Staszewski closed the session by
inviting all to join the Coalition for
Adult Literacy. .

Anyone can volunteer his or her
services by calling 255-1155 and tell-
ing a coalition member exactly how
he or she wants to help.

Luke Kluchko.

.He was a person of some
reknown here at Pitt as an
undergrad.

President of the student govern-
ment, dedicated brother in the
Delta Tau Delta fraternity, pretty

much an all-around good guy.

Some time last year the office of
student activities decided to create
a new graduate assistant position.

The person would work with
Greek Adviser Bridgette Guernsey,
assisting her with various ad-
ministrative tasks, and yes,
overseeing the monitoring of dry
rush.

According to Guernsey, since
Kluchko had experience with both
the student government and the

We stopped by Post 3 and picked
up Officer Shamlin, and we were off
to Arby’s. Just as we were about to
enter the building, a white Jeep
peeled out of the Giant Eagle park-
ing lot with a man chasing it with a
machete. The officers observed the
situation and called it in. Nothing had
really happened, so no immediate ac-
tion could be taken. But the officers

stayed there and watched the-

situation.

Everything seemedfine, but they
notified the city police. I thought we
were never going to eat.

Officer Kiefer and I drove around
the block and looked for the guy with
the machete. Officer Shamlin walked

Greek system, he was a natural
choice for the new position.

Since taking the post, Kluchko
has found himself in rather dif-
ficult straits.

"A lot of fraternity members still
look at him as a peer, not as a
member of the office of student
activities,” said Guernsey.

’’I get looks. I get the finger,”
said Kluchko. "That really doesn't
matter. They're not making me
any worse a person by it."

to the parking lot and checked it out.
Everything seemed back to normal.

We finally got to eat. We were out
of service for about 30 minutes. It
seemed like we were in and out of
the place.

We dropped Officer Shamlin back
at his post and went back on patrol.

We drove by President Posvar’s
house, and everything looked fine.
Every patrol car is required to go by
Posvar’s house twice a shift.

At 9:48, we called out for a
building check of fine arts. This is
when the officer checks the doors in
the building to see if they are secure.
At this time, Officer Kiefer wrote the
burglary report. It was now 10:47.

Tl-IE PITT Nisws, wednesaay, October 1, 1986

After calls to several fraternities
and a lot of "off the record” talk,
I can assume that Kluchko is not
their closest friend.

But this is not different from any
other university administrator.
Many of us have some disagree-
ments with the administration at
some point while we're students.

The difference here seems to be
the line Kluchko is walking.

He is still associated with Delta
Tau Delta because friends don't
just go away after you graduate.

'’I do things to appear I'm an
impartial person,” he said. "A lot
of people don't think I am."

Between the threatening ads in
this paper, gestures and a lot of
rumors flying around about how

We were on our way back in to the
station, when one of the guards spot-
ted an intoxicated person following
and harrassing a lady. We stopped
and assisted the guard. Officers Kiefer
and Fink followed the man off of Pitt
property.

We only had one hour to go. We
dropped officer Fink off at the
Cathedral and went out to Posvar’s
house for the last time on our shift.

-We also checked several parking lots
on our way back to the station.

The shift was over. It was time to
go home. ’ - .

As you can see, the only time spent
not doing anything was the 30
minutes for dinner break.

is Lukebeingthreatened by stormtroopers?

awful Luke Kluchko is, one has to
wonder how much it affects him
and if it would cause him to quit
the job for a more normal life.
Kluchko admits it gets to him at
times.

"It depends. Not really, well,
sometimes it slightly gets to me,
but it's part of the job," he said.

"|t's hard for him, being a
former member of a fraternity,”
Guernsey said, "just as it's hard
for me to be both enforcer and
counselor to the fraternities.”

Kluchko has managed to do
both so far and has shown no in-
tention of quitting. He said the
position lasts for two years. Judg-
ing from the talk he and I had,
he'll be back again.

Bill flips through the time
schedule book, his sweaty hands
sticking to the pages.

’’l have to choose a damn ma-
jor," he muttered as visions of his
father flashed through his mind.
He always sees his father when
he's picking classes —~— he sees that
look, the tall dark -figure slowly
shaking his head from side to side.
The look of silent disapproval.

Bill's dad wants him to do what
he wants for a' living, and even
though dad's paying the tuition
he's not going to tell Bill what to
take. -

Then, Bill looks to the bench on
his left, and sees a student
publication lying face-up to the

sun. His problems are solved.

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, October 11, 1986.

\By Rosanna Rodriguez
F3i‘The Pitt News

The position of Dean of the Facul-
. ty of Arts and Sciences entails the
2 management of a $40 million yearly
budget and leadership of 30 depart-
_ ments. After five weeks, the newly
appointed dean, Peter Koehler,
makes adjusting to this position his
main objective.

The FAS is managed well, accord-
ing to Irwin Schulman, dean of the
College of Arts and Sciences. He said
he sees no reasons for Koehler to
. make any drastic changes.

j ”Dean Koehler isa very thoughtful,
responsible and reflective person.
- That means that I don't think he w-ill
. do anything shocking,” Schulman
said.

Koehler said the lack of funding is
his major problem.

’’I think if I had found a particular
area where I found the situation to be
different than what I expected it to be,

it is [that] the leaness of operating
funds throughout the department is
really much more severe than what
i had anticipated. There is very little
flexibility,” Koehler said.

This year's budget, however, had
already been planned by former
dean, Jerome Rosenberg. Koehler
said this leaves him little room to
maneuver.

’’I am trying to create some extra
room,” he said.

Koehler said he is strongly against
the idea of unionization at the
university.

’’It would be counterproductive to
our efforts to make this a better
university,” he said. -

According to Koehler, unionization
could result ”in replacing coopera-
tion between faculty and administra-
tion with confrontation.” Secondly,
he adds,”it would make Pitt less com-
petitive in terms of attracting and re-
taining a highly talented faculty."

eter Koihler
Koehler is quick to praise the
department heads of FAS.
”l have sensed in all the depart-
ments a true desire to better

‘themselves. I don't have to tell them

that they should better themselves,”
he said. Instead, he pointed out, ’’I
think my role is to make it possible
for them to achieve these goals that
they are setting for themselves.”

College Republicans 
working to secure
success of four

state party candidates

By Christopher Sepesy

.For the Pitt News

On Monday night, College
Republicans’ President Roan Confer
urged members to continue working
for the success of Republican can-
didates.

”Though we are ahead in some of
the polls, that doesn't mean we can
get too big-headed,” Confer said.
”We still need all the help we can
get.”

In the next two months the club
will be working for the endorsement
of gubernatorial candidate Bill Scran-
ton, incumbent senatorial candidate
Arlen Specter and congressional seat
candidates Ernie Buckman and
Howard Ash. Confer said he feels
with enough work, their victories will
be secured.

Confer said that he also has plans
for the club to be involved with many
on-campus activities involving the
elections before Nov. 14. These
would include voter registration and
candidate endorsement displays.

”Our main purpose until election
day is to make people more political-
ly aware of the issues,” Confer told
the group. ”Of course we would like
them to see the republican side and
have them vote that way, but how
they vote is solely up to the in-
dividual.” ‘ '

According to Confer, the College
Republicans have recently experi-
enced a new-found popularity on
campus. Pitt's chapter has grown
from a membership of about 25 three
years ago to its present size of 350
members.

Confer said he thought that Presi-
dent Reagan’s charisma contributed
to the increase in the number of Col-
lege Republicans, but was not the
sole cause. ' _

’’It seems the American public has
found a new folk hero in Ronald
Reagan, one they feel they can
always rely on,” Confer said. ”But‘
Reagan has only set the course — it

.. is the republican ideology that the

American people are now guiding
themselves by.”

Confer continued, ”After the fiasco
of the late Carter '70s, the election
tide shifted to a more moderately
conservative position. The publichas
now seen that it has worked, and I
strongly believe they want it to stay
that way. But that doesn't mean we
don't have to work for_it to continue
on that way,” he said.

Surprise

Joe Felitsky, the Central Catholic graduate who transferred to Pitt from Notre Dame, is now Pitt's second

 

...,;;'

string quarterback. Mike Gottfried -has indicated he wants to redshirt both Sal Genilla and Larry Wanke.‘

Felitsky emerges as backup QB 

By John Enright

Assistant Sports Editor

Senior quarterback John Con-
gemi’s brilliant play this season
has put Panther coach Mike Gott-
fried in a viable situation for next
season.

Because of Congemi’s sparkling
play the past two weeks in vic-
tories against Purdue and West
Virginia, plus the return of Joe
Felitsky, Gottfried is now in a
position where he can redshirt
backup quarterbacks Sal Genilla
and Larry Wanke.

Gottfried will probably not
make that decision until the end
of the season because, in an
emergency situation, he may still

go with Genilla or Wanke. ”I -

would like to have both Genilla

fried at yesterday's media lun-
cheon. ’’I know Sal is going to be
a good quarterback here, and so
is Wanke. I don't want to lose
them a year of eligibility.” If reri-
shirted, Genilla, a 6-3 junior col-
lege All-American from San
Mateo, Ca., would still have two ‘

years eligibility remaining, while
Wanke, a 6-2 freshman from
Cleveland, Oh., would have four
years left.

But for now, Felitsky, a 6-3
junior from Pittsburgh's Central
Catholic High School, is the sec-

‘Genilla has been moved to the

scout team.

This change is all due to the
return of Felitsky, whohad missed
the majority of fall cam_p with a
shoulder injury and had been sick
for the first few weeks of the
regular season. He is now healthy,
and he mopped up for Conge i

in last Saturday's 48-16 shellack- \'\

ing of the Mountaineers.

This year's quarterback situation
has been somewhat of a surprise,
but not because of Congemi’s suc-
cess. Rather, it is due to the fact
that at the end of spring camp and
during the early part of fall camp,
Genilla appeared to be a better
quarterback than Congemi.

But when the season started
Sept. 1 against Maryland, Con-
gemi was the starting quarterback.
And from allgindications his start-
ing stature is a good thing. The
fifth—year quarterback has passed
for 917 yards and five
touchdowns in Pitt's first four
games, while ‘completing 56.2 ‘

percent of his passes. He was
named ECAC Player of the Week
for his performance against West

Virginia. .
Gottfried has obviously been
pleased with his quarterback.
"Our system fits John well. He's
smart and heady, and he makes a
lot of changes at the line of scrim-
mage and after the ball has been
snapped,” said Gottfried. ”I’m
py for him and not just the

 

”I put Sa \ahead of John in

that.

”Sal had the best ofJohn early
in spring, but then John came on.
He never came into my office and

petition has helped John become

”It was a very good game. I thought;
everybody on our team played well,’-_
and it was a team effort. We are real-if

Although the game ended in a tie,
it felt like a winning effort from Pitt_’s
point of view. ' P  ‘ i
”This may have been the best?

The Lady Panther volleyball team
returned from Florida a little burnt
and more aware of their shortcom-
ings. Now 10-5 in regular season
play, Pitt finished third, behind
Houston and Iowa respectively, in
the Florida Invitational. Host Florida
placed last. -

Pitt and Iowa battled it out Friday
night in a five-game match. Pitt's
primary offense, Denise Frawley, Sue
Hoover and Lisa Stewart, came off
the Pitt Classic playing nearly flawless
volleyball last weekend. However,
inconsistency caused them to be very
ineffective against Iowa and Houston.
The Hawkeyes emerged victorious
three «games to two (15-7, 4-15,
15-13, 8-15 and 15-5). This was a
critical loss suffered by the Lady Pan-
thers. Later in the season, this could
Cost Pitt a good seat in the NCAA
tournament. _

Houston also defeated the Panthers
13-15, 15-13, 15-3 and 15-11.

Noreen Coughlin emerged as an im-
pressive spiker in the first two
matches. She had 25 kills for the
whole tournament. The Lady Pan-

thers played their best match of the
year against Florida. Pitt took an im-
pressive three game to zero win over
Florida (15-10, 17-15 and 15-8).
Despite losses to lowa and Houston,
the Lady Panthers were able to
bounce back for the Florida game.
Noreen Coughlin, Sue Hoover,
Louise O’Shaughnessey, Kris Wexell
and Krista Ziener all turned in stand-
out performances. Hoover lead Pitt
with 41 kills; Frawley chipped in with
29. Stewart killed 22, and Coughlin
had 25. Errors are what hurt the Lady
Panthers. Pitt had 55 miscues bet-
ween these players alone.

’’It was a great tournament for us
to play in. All four teams had similar
abilities. We were all good teams
fighting for a national ranking. Even
in our losses, we learned a great
deal,” noted Collier. ”For us to be a
really good team by the end of the
season, we must play consistently as
well as outplay the others.”

The Lady Panthers travel to the
Georgetown _ Classic this weekend.
Pitt wil|’be rematched against the
Hoyas. (Pitt defeated the Hoyas in
three games on Sept. 21.) Maryland
and Howard will also try to defeat the
Lady Panthers.

Gottfried at ease
with tough press

By Bob Travers
Sports Editor

The media will always have the ad-
vantage, some say, because the last
word is always theirs. A reporter gets
a quote and is free to manipulate it
in whatever way he chooses. It may
be unethical, but the list of reporters
taking quotes out of context and
twisting the words of another for their
own purposes is a long one. And the
examples of, the press treating
somebody unfairly are too numerous
to list here.

Then there are the cases, the vast
majority of cases, in which an athlete
or coach or movie star has a mutual-
ly beneficial relationship with the
media. The press gets their stories
from him, and he gets the publicity
from them. There are more Lee
Trevinos than Steve Carltons in the

world.

Pitt coach Mike Gottfried would
count himself among that majority.
Gottfried said he has never been
treated what he would call unfairly
by the press since he became a head
coach eight years ago, but some of
his acquaintances in the coaching
field have been victims of vicious
media attacks.

’’I ‘think the worst I ever saw a
coach treated was Warren Powers at
Missouri,” Gottfried said. ”They just
didn't let up his last year there.”

Powers was hired by the Universi-
ty of Missouri in 1978 to resurrect its
floundering football program. His first
year as Tigers coach, Powers guided
his squad to an 8-4 record, including
a 20-15 win over LSU in the Liberty
Bowl. In 1979 Missouri went to the
Tangerine Bowl. In 1980, 1981 and
1983 Missouri again went to bowl
games. In 1984 the bottom fell out
of the Missouri program as the Tigers

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, October 1, 1986

Continued from page 13

-Seriously though, Iinsley sure
didn't look like he was playing his
first collegiate game at receiver
against the Mountaineers. Maybe he
should have been a wide out from
the start? Heck, that's one of the posi-
tions he played at Cooley High
School in Detroit.

Gottfried is impressed with his
latest addition to the receiving corps,
but he doesn't feel Tinsley has played
the last three years out of position.
"it's not so much that Keith was play-
ing out of position, because he did
some good things for us defensively,”
said Gottfried. ”But it is remarkable
the job he did for only playing
[receiver] for four or five days.”

How remarkable? Well, let Gott-

fried explain. ”Last Wednesday at
practice there were five pro scouts

   
  

standing near me. It was raining, and
Keith made a cut on the turf, caught
a pass and turned up field full speed.

”Somebody asked me, ‘Who is
he?’ I explained to them about Keith
"moving from offense to defense, and
every one of the scouts wrote his
name down. They said as well as he
runs and with the hands he has, he
could be projected into a possibility
of being looked at more [by pro
scouts].”

Tinsley will not start this Saturday
against the Temple Owls, but he will
definitely see playing time. Pitt's
receiving corps is thin, and with
Williams injured, the Panthers are
depending on inexperienced receiv-
ers such as Billy Osborn, Hosea
Heard and Tinsley.

But that doesn't bother Tinsley in
the least. ”The attitude of this team

has been great, and being a part of
it is great,” said Tinsley. ”That is one
of the reasons why I didn't have any
objection to playing receiver. You
just want to be a part of a great thing
when it's going.”

Tinsley’s team-oriented philosophy
hasn't gone unnoticed by his coach,
who fully understands Pitt's need for
a family atmosphere after the care-
free attitude of last year's team.
”Keith is a team player. He has had
a good attitude ever since I got here,”
said Gottfried. ’’It’s a good sign. He
was given a new role and accepted
it. He did whatever he had to do to
help us.”

Help indeed. Hopefully, Tinsley
will improve week-to-week at

went 3-7-1. Powers was fired at the
end of the season.
During his career at Missouri,

Powers was 46-36-3. Take away '

1984 and he was 43—29—2, a record
that is not outstanding, but not poor
enough to rate a firing after only one
bad year.

’’I think Warren was treated unfair-
ly throughout his career,” Missouri
Sports Information Director Bob
Brendel said. ”When he first took
over in 1978 a lot of people got a bad
first impression of him. They thought
he was aloof and distant, which
wasn't the case at all. Warren just had
a hard time getting close to people
right away. Through the years i built
a terrific relationship with him.”

Part of Powers’ problem, Brendel
said, stemmed from the fact that he
never tried to be ”one of theboys"
at media gatherings.

”A lot of times.he didn't feel like
joking with the press, and they took
thatithe wrong way,” said Brendel.

”Missouri is st-range because of all
the coverage we get,” Brendel notes.
”There are two major daily papers in
St. Louis, one in Kansas City, two in
Columbia — which is very rare for a
city of only 80,000 people — plus
our student newspapers which are
very active because of the huge
numbers of journalism students we
have here. There are at least 15
reporters at every practice.”

Such intense coverage, coupled
with Powers’ arrogant image, turned
the coach into a media scapegoat in
1984.

”When we started slipping in
1984, it seemed everybody just ex-
aggerated the negative,” Brendel
remembered. ”First impressions, be-
ing what they are, tend to last, and
Warren was never able to overcome
his image. In 1984 that hurt him.

”We had one reporter who began
every story he wrote that year with
a comment about how Powers’
predecessor lasted only seven years
and that this was Powers’ seventh
year. He just was not a flashy guy,
and he was never comfortable in
dealing with the media.”

While never getting as extreme_as
that, the Pittsburgh media openly
called for the dismissal of Pitt coach
Foge Fazio late in the 1985 season.
The team's poor record and a sizable
drop in attendance (possibly made
lower by negative news coverage) led
the Pitt Athletic Administration to fire
Fazio after the 1985 season. A few
weeks later they hired Gottfried.

”l’ve never been bothered by the
media,” Gottfried said. ”l like peo-
ple, and I don't mind at all dealing
with reporters. Actually, I wouldn't
mind being a reporter for a couple
days.”

The first-year Pitt coach said he has
found the Pittsburgh media to be
about the same as what he contend-
ed with at Kansas.

”People think that at Kansas I didn't
have to deal with the media, but they
are forgetting that Kansas City is right
there, Wichita is there, and Topeka

is there, so I'm used to dealing with _

it.”

Gottfried took in stride a Pitt News .

error in September which quoted him
as urging students to think of the Hill
District as-an optical illusion. What
Gottfried actually said ' was that
students should think of Cardiac Hill
as an illusion. ’’I never thought I'd
hear the end of it,” he said, laughing.
The difference between Gottfried’s
situation and Powers’ is ultimately
one of personality. Some will never
be comfortable while being inter-
viewed and will never look good on
TV. Gottfried has had no problems
adjusting to the glare of the Pittsburgh
media and the Kansas City media.
That fact alone can make his job
much easier. Historians have said that
Abraham Lincoln could never be
elected president today because he
didn't have good enough looks for
television, and he was awkward with
the media. That would probably
eliminate him, too, from ever
coaching college football.
