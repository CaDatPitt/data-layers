Students, professors
react to make-up days

Saturday classes could inconvenience some

Michael Macagnone and
Erin Block

It didn’t take Pitt students long
to begin complaining about the
idea of making up last week’s snow
days on Saturdays.

Less than four hours [after the ,,

news broke, students had formed
Facebook groups against the idea:
“I will not be attending make-up
class on Saturdays,” “Saturday
classes? EPIC FAIL PITT.”

Ravi Patel, a sophomore, said
he hoped the University had con-
tacted at least some students and
professors before they scheduled
the makeup days.

“It’s logical if the days were
based on student input. It would
be smart to have a two—way con-

night, but administrators didn’t
directly contact students until
almost ‘24 hours later, when Pitt

Pitt to adjust loan process

University hopes to make loan process easier for students and families

Eva Bugos
For The Pitt'News

The University said it hopes to
make the Stafford and PLUS loans
process easier for students and
their families.

An e—mail that Pitt’s Office of
Admissions and Financial Aid sent
late last month informed students
that Pitt will switch to a direct loan

program for the 2010-11 academic
year.

This means that students will
get subsidized and unsubsidized
Stafford and PLUS loans directly
from the U.S. Department of Edu-
cation, which will now serve as
the single point of contact for the
loan process, from application to
repayment. ,

Pitt students currently receive
those loans through the Federal

Family Education Loan Program, -

in which students obtain the loans
from participating private insti.-.
tutions, such as banks or credit
unions. '

The interest rates on Stafford
loans will not change.

But interest rates on PLUS loans
will decrease from 8.5 percent with
FFELP to 7.9 percent with the direct
lending program, formally named
the William D. Ford Federal Direct

snows, it

4 to 6 inches expected

Liz Navratil
News Editor

Meteorologists predict that Pitts-
burgh could receive another 4 to
6 inches of snow this week.

Charlie Woodrum, a meteo-
rologist for the National Weather
Service, said a storm crossing the
Ohio Valley should hit Pittsburgh
this afternoon, bringing 1 to 3
inches of snow during the day
and 2 to 3 inches tonight. The
snow will continue into Tuesday,
in the form of scattered show-
ers. ‘

Woodrum said this snow will
be lighter than the snow that fell
during last week’s record snow-

storm, but that it could still be

dangerous for drivers.

Temperatures will remain
below freezing, with a high of
about 30 degrees today and tem-
peratures dropping into the teens
tonight. Tuesday, the high will
probably be in the upper 20s,
meaning the snow could accu-
mulate, Woodrum said.

He said it’s possible Pittsburgh
could receive some flurries after
this storm, but that he doesn’t
think any signiﬁcant storms will
‘hit Pittsburgh soon after today’s
snowfall.

Administrators and employees     
discuss ‘essential’ personnel, snow

Workers fight wedther conditions to keep University functioning

John Manganaro
Staff Writer

Like many Pitt employees, Donna
Washington commutes to work by
riding the bus and walking Oakland’s
pedestrian—friendly streets.

But unlike  employees, Wash-
ington holds an “essential position” at
Pitt, and had to battle t:he elements and
report to campus during last week’s
snow cancellations.

Washington works as a security
guard in Towers’ lobby, monitoring
the ﬂow of student traﬂic in and out of
the dormitories. Her home is located
near Trees Hall in North Oakland, and
itusuallytakes heraboutzo minutesto
getto work. Iastweek, Mother Nature
and University policy complicated her
commute, she said, and the trip took
nearly an hour each way.

“I usually cruise down Lothrop
Street and cut along Fifth,” Washing-
ton said. “Last week I had to wrap all
the way around Oakland to get down
the hill. Lothrop was buried and the
buses were shut down.” .'

Washington managedtomakeitto
work“justafew minutes late” each day,
she said, addingthathersuperiorswere
sympathetic about their employees’ dif-
ﬁculties in reaching campus.

“Getting home from work was the
worstpart,” she said.“The PortAuthor—
ity buses weren’t even trying to get up
thehill. I had towa1kallthewayup.”

Pitt spokesman John Fedele ex-
plained why Washington and other
Pitt employees had to report to work
last week, even though classes were
canceled and more than two feet of

snow fell.

I “There are certain positions that
the Universitycannot operatewithout,
whichareconsidered essential,”Fedele
said. “The deﬁnition of essential per-
sonnel is determined at the individual
responsibility levelineach department,

include any emergencypersonnel such
aspolice, mechanical and groundstatf.
Thesearetiiepeoplewhokeeptlieheat

running, the water running, the eleva-

tors running,” Fedele said. “Some lab
technicians are also considered essen-
tial personnel”

ing down here. We’ve managed pretty
much the same way everyone else did,
just trudging along.” ‘

which is justafancywaytosaythe pro-
cess is not centralized.”

The University leaves the process
of determining which employees are
essential up to the individual depart-
ments and divisions, Fedele said. When
Pitt hires a new employee, he or she is
informed whether or not they are es-
sential personnel, depending on how
vital their position is todaily campus
operations. Ifan employee is termed
essential, then they are expected to
show up at work even during record
snowfalls.

Fedele wasn’t able to comment on
exactly how many essential personnel
thereareat Pitt, but he did describe the
types of positions typically included in
that category. ‘

“Because itis not centralized, we do
not keep track of everyone considered
essential, butingeneralthese positions

Many of the laboratories at Pitt re— I
quire 24-hour monitoring and work,’

Fedele explained. And so somelabtech-.
 and researchers who havetests
or maintenance scheduled must come
in even when the rest of the campus
isn’t open. ~ '

The last main category of essential
personnel are those employees who
work in food service. Although work-
ersinthis categoryarehiredby Sodexo
and are not technically Pitt employees,
theyareconsidered essentialto campus
operation - . .

As of press-time Sunday, neither
Dining Services nor Sodexo responded
to emails and phone calls requesting
information about the way last week’s
snow affected operations.

‘.‘We are not allowed to share spe-
ciﬁcs,” Ramesh Reddy, a manager for
SodexoinMarket Central, said. “Butthe

“The chancellor is always work-

said. “I can’t say whether or not they

buttheywere expected tokeepthe Uni-
versity functioning during the storm.

Pitt named top ‘military—friendly’ school

Military publication releases third annual guide of military — friendly universities

Tonyjovenitti
Staff Writer

FreshmanBryan Szczurisjustlike every
other Pitt student —— except he wakes
up before 6 am. every day, and when
he graduates, hewillbecome a second
lieutenant in the U.S. Army.

Szczuris acadetintheArmy ROTC
program at Pitt, and every morning at
6:30, he meetshisfellow cadets outside
Belleﬁeld Hall for an hour of rigorous
physical training.

But after 7:30 am, he is a 
— and a student

This isaway oflife forthousands of
ROTC students across the United States
at nearly every university.

Butaccordingto MilitaryAdvanced
Education —— a bimonthly publica-
tion that describes itselfas a ‘journal
of higher education for today’s ser-
vicemember” — Pitt is not like other
schools with ROTC programs.

The publication named Pitt one of
the nation’s top military-friendly uni-
versities in its third armual guide to
military-friendlyuniversities. The guide

attempts to “start representingschools
that have good attributesfor those in
military ﬁelds,” Mark Fitzgerald, the
magazine’s managing editor, said.

“Itwasbased onabunch of criteria,
suchastop academics, online programs
and veteran support,” Fitzgerald said.

Schools with ROTC programs sub-
mitted a questionnaire and a portfolio
to Military Advanced Education. Last
year, only 60 schools made thelist.Pitt
was not among those 60.

This year, more than 100 schools
were selected.

Fitzgerald said more schools re-
spondedtoti1epublication’s surveythis

year,andheattributedittotheCr.I.Bill -

passed in 2008. -

Ofthe 16 BigEastschools, the Uni-
versity ofSouti1F1oridaistheonly other
schoolthatmade the year. Penn
State University also made the list.

But Fitzgerald said this is “by no
means a comprehensive list.”

Szczur agreed.

He grewup aPittfan and always
knewhewantedto a&endPit1:. Itwasn’t
until his junioryear ofhigh school that

he started thinking about ROTC.

“I looked into the trainingand the
experience it provided me with, and I
contacted Pitt’s ROTC,” he said, “and
they got meascholarship.” .

He said Pitt’s many surrounding
resources make it a great place for
ROTC.

“We have Schenley Park and Car-
negie Mellon. Everything we need is
right here,” he said.

Major Shawn Gralinski, admissions
and enrollment ofﬁcer for Pitt’s Army

ROTC, got his undergraduate degree 1

at The Citadel —— The Military College
of South Carolina — and gothis mas-
ter’s degree at Webster University in
St. Louis. ,

“I had never been here until my as-
signment,” Gralinski said.

The Army allowed him to choose _

which ROTC program he wanted to
join. Hiswife isfromwheeling, a_ndPitI
offered the closest opening. ,
“Thereis agreatatmosphere here,”
he said. “It’s a welcoming and invit-
ing campusand city. The veterans are
treated with dignity and respect here,

and that’s not always the case [else-
where],” he said.

He served two tours of duty inlraq
— one from 2004-05 and another
from 2008-09. As.a veteran, he ﬁnds
Pittsburgh and the University “com—
foning.”

“I feel like we are welcomed no mat-
ter people’s personal opinion on the
war,” he said.

But he attributed Pitt’s success as a
military-ﬁiendlyuniversity more to the
Oﬂice ofVeterans Services.

“We have an outstanding veteran’s
affairs oﬁioe,” he said. “They are very
proactive in rnakingveterans feel wel-
come.” ‘ *

The journals briefsummary ofPitt’s

Ofﬁce ofveterans Services.

“The [oﬂice] offers military stu-

‘rangingfrom academic and ﬁnancial

aidassistanceto career counseling and
networking,” the article reported.
V “The ofﬁce helps military students

access their tuition beneﬁts, as well as
offers pre-admission counseling, to
plan long—term goals and answer ques-
tions.”

“We help [veterans] from the mo-

moment they graduate,” Ann Rairigh,

director of the Ofﬁce of Veterans Ser-

vices, said. T ’

She said the office helps veterans
process G.I. Bill beneﬁts.

instructors. Pitt spokesman John Fedele
did not say why administrators chose to
wait to inform students.

Fedele said the decision came from the
provost’s ofﬁce and that Pitt consulted
“representatives from the appropriate
constituencies” in making the decision.
He did not say whether administrators
consulted any students or student groups
before making their decision, and all calls
to the provost’s ofﬁce were referred back
to Fedele.

Fedele said that if Pitt has more snow
days, it’s possible students could make
those up on Saturdays as well, but that the
University will “address future disruptions
as they occur.”

Numerous students complained about
the dates of the make-up classes: March
27 and April 17.

The night of March 27, Pitt Program
Council will sponsor a Kid Cudi concert.
That is also the day after Greek Sing, an
event Pitt’s Interfraternity Council and Pan-

hellenic Conference hold to raise money
for the University of Pittsburgh Cancer
Institute.

Thirteen Monday classes end at 9:30
p.m. or later, according to Peoplesoft, the
program that keeps track of classes offered
each semester.

Danielle Solomon, a junior and member
of the Chi Omega sorority, asked, “Is that
a sick joke?” when she ﬁrst heard about
the make-up days. She said that it “would

Solomon said she didn’t understand the
need for the make-up days.

“I don’t think any professor’s semester
was ruined by a couple snow days,” she
said. _

Alexandra Schmidt, a senior, said she
was concerned that the April 17 make-up
day might interfere with some her ﬁnals in
Pitt’s business school. .

Fedele said students with conflicts
should work them out with their profes-
sors. Professors may also choose not to
hold classes on the make-up days and to
instead ﬁnd other ways fo make up for the

‘ missed-time.

Bryan Roberts, a doctoral student in
Pitt’s History and Philosophy of Science
department, teaches a Saturday afternoon
class. He said that he had not heard about
conﬂicts from any of his students.

“Many of the students who take Satur-
day classes have conﬂicts with classes dur-
ing the week anyway,” he said. Many of his
students work during the week, he said.

Roberts said that the missed week’s
worth of class wasn’t a huge disruption.

“We’ve shortened the time we’re spend-
ing on some material on the syllabus, but
we’ll be back on schedule in two weeks,”
he said.

She said the direct lending program
provides a more secure source of funding,
especially after the confusion that the bank-
ing crisis caused. '

Many banks either changed the terms
of their loans or dropped out of the FFELP,
forcing students to switch lenders.

Direct lending will be “much more
straightforward, much more streamlined
 and students will know that they have
one secure source of funding,” McColloch
said. '

But the ﬁnancial crisis didn’t cause Pitt to
change the loan processing system.

McColloch said a national movement
toward direct lending has started. Pitt ad-
ministrators considered the change sev-
eral years ago, she said, but they decided
to allow time for the University to adapt to

Opinions

EDITORIAL

How will you spend
your Saturday?

how college tuition translates

into each class session of each
course taken during a term. It seems
that tuition divided by the number
of class sessions gives an accurate
monetary value, around $30 in state
and $65 out of state. Then again, if a
class session is missed, a student can
still complete and earn the credits for
that course as if the absence never
happened.

Determining which is the right
view depends on personal convic-
tions and is irrelevant to the snow
day classes Pitt students can make up
on Saturdays, March 27 and April 17.
The university handed the responsi-
bility of making up missed classes to
the instructors. Only if an instructor
holds a class is it at all mandatory. If a
class is not held, then this news does
not affect a student.

If some Pitt students feel they lost
their money by missing classes, they
can make up the time if their instruc-
tors so choose. If Pitt students have
other commitments, such as pre-
existing Saturday classes or an aver-
sion to the extra attendance, they can
play hooky all the same.

On acase by case basis, the Office
of the Provost has accomplished one
of two extremes: extra diﬂiculty and
effort for students and professors or
absolutely nothing. They have done
nothing if instructors will not hold
classes on the Saturdays, as it’s still
their decision. Then again, there is
legitimate cause for concern if stu-
dents have other commitments or
classes during the scheduled Satur~
days.

Hearing this decision by word
of mouth makes it seem ridiculous,
but really, aﬁerbreaking it down, the
university has not put all students in

I t is hard to understand exactly

a lock; they have to please everyone,
those thatwant their money’s worth
including. The success of these Sat-
urdays for those with other classes
or plans simply hinge on the ﬂex-
ibility of the professors. Nothing has
changed as aspects of a class often
depend on an instructor’s qualities.

However, certain aspects of
timing cause some understandable
frustration. First, the Pitt Program
Council is hosting the thrilling Kid
Cudi concert on March 27. This will
prove to be an inconvenience to stu-
dents with night classes to be made
up that Saturday, or just classes then
in general.

April 17, the other proposed date,
is also just before ﬁnals. In fact, some
students have ﬁnals scheduled for
that day by choice of their instruc-
tors. And a class right before the
long haul week is a little less than
appealing.

Finally, and more importantly,
the decision-making process is dis-
concerting.

There should have been a simple
poll or feedback system asking stu-
dents if and when to have Saturday
classes. It is not entirely unlikely that
a simple majority of those students
that wanted these makeup sessions
prefer a speciﬁc Saturday to do so.
There needs to be more transpar-
ency and communication with these
kinds of decisions than is presently
conducted.

Making up classes during leisure
time does not sound good to anyone
— the students or the instructors.
But there are students that both want
and don’t want these classes, so a
ﬂexible decision had to be made.

Hopefully, instructors will be as
understanding as they were during
the snowstorm.

Silent hero of the past

 
  
 

. Caitlyn Christensen
Columnist

Aquarter of a century ago,J.D. Salinger
disappeared intohisNew Hampshire
home. His deathlastmonth initiateda
new discussion ofhis small collection
of works and, perhaps more preva-
lently, his famous reclusiveness.

Along with other literary herrnits
like Harper Lee, Salingerwas eminent
forhistalentas muchashewasforhis
enigma. He was a writer who didn’t
write for an audience -— he once fa-
mously called pub1ishingan“invasion
of privacy.”

What Salinger did thenwould never
ﬂy now, inatime when self—promotion
is as much a part of an artist’s success
as his talent.

Every band has a manager, every
aspiring writer an agent e a whole
industry built upon personal adver-
tising. Does an author’s work lose
potential when it is not constructed
upon celebrity?

If “The Catcher in the Rye” were
written today, it wouldn’t matter how

much it spoke to a generation of dis-
enchanted adolescents. Salingerwould
have had to run a blog and website to
get the manuscript on a publisher’s
desk.

He would have to go on booktours
and spend some time on Oprah’s couch
to get anyone to look at the thing. He
would need interviews on NPR and
the “Today Show,” an appearance on
“Larry King” and “The Colbert Re-
port”

To make any kind of money, Salin-
ger would have to sell his work to a
whole crummy slew of phonies. He
would have to make sure he wanted
it out there for the world to read and
criticize.

Salingerwould never have made it
onto the New York Times best—seller
list.

“The Catcher in the Rye” was in-
cluded in a20o5 Time magazine list of
the 100 best English-language novels
since 1923.

The success of a book that lacks
an audience makes me wonder what
genius manuscripts ﬂoat around to-
day, hidden under the mattresses of
authors too shy and insecureto expose

their inner thoughts on 'I‘witter.
Perhaps the greatest works come
from the humblest of sources.

The lessonl take from Salinger is '

to look at this new generation of self-
promoting authors and artists with a
grain of salt. A single voice can reso-
natelouderthanahandful ofmediocre
self-promoters.

If the publishing industry were
modeled more on Salinger and less
on Hollywood sensationalism, we
wouldn’t have deceptive authors like
James Frey messing with our heads.

Today, the likes of Dan Brown
and Sarah Palinlfrequently occupy
the New York Times best—seller list. If

, fame were taken off the table, artists

who invested in their work without
agenda would barely have any room
to enlighten us.

One of the ﬁrst lessons I learned
in my English writing classes is the
importance ofwritingwithamessage
tailored toward the reader:

We learn thatawork should never
be totally self-indulgent.

millions withoutageneratioh ofbrain-
washed, over—sexed teenage girls.

On the contrary, Salinger proves
that unmarketed, disconnected writ-
ing can successﬁilly tap into a social
undercurrent — in his case, issues like
identity, belonging, connection ‘and
alienation.

Then again, perhaps the discon-
nectedwriterwill neverbe able to write
about anythingbesides those issues, at
the risk ofbecoming tiresome.

In life, Salingerwasn’ttoo different
f'rorn Holden Caulﬁeld, aﬁctional char-
acter in “The Catcher in the Rye.”

According to his daughter; Mar-
garet Salinger; he suffered from post-

traurnatic stress disorder, likely from -

his time spent in the military during

/ World War H. He married twice, the

second time to awoman 40 years his
junior. . .

_ He also had an affair with an 18-
year-old when he was in his 50s.

Disconnected from his own age _

group, he formed his best relationships
with children. In letters to friend and
author Lillian Ross, Salinger referred

to the townspeople in his home of L

Cornish, N.H., as “crummy parents,
summer parents.”
Salinger could write well about
alienation because his life imitated
I will always have a soft spot for
“Nine Stories” and “Franny and Zoo-

ey” in particular. In “The Catcher in
the Rye,” Holden Caulﬁeld says, “What
really knocks me out is a book that,
when you’re all done reading it, you
wishthe authorthat wrote itwas ater—
riﬁc friend of yours.”

Salinger wrote a terriﬁc book, but
he was far too estranged to be a ter-
riﬁc friend. f

In the end, it doesn’t matter what
themanwaslike. It doesn’t even matter
if he wrote the books for me to read.

But subconsciously, Salinger was

p able to transcend his self—indulgence

to craft stories applicable to any lost,
disenchanted adult teen. He didn’tt1y
to make me worship him. He didn’t
stand on a soapbox shouting for m
to heed his call. 
For that, he has my ear more than
any celebrity author everwill have.

Legis|aturief0|' Slexting silly, inconsistent

'.:Ylo_1mg sexters are not only  -of  -also poor legislation.’

 

 

‘Mark Kozlowski
, Columnist

   

Pennsylvania deals daily with prob-
lems caused by people who have an
alternate conception of morality and
general human decency.

After all, that’s why we have pris-
ons, courts, laws and 253 jokers in
Harrisburg to create them.

Well, some members of the Gen-
eral Assembly have cooked up an-
other good one —— a necessary bill
that still manages to be silly.

The bill, like most silly bills, has
good intentions.

Last year, Wyoming County saw
a judge bar a prosecutor from ﬁling
child pornography charges against
three teens for sending interesting
photos of themselves to others on
their cell phones.

The prosecutor threatened to
charge the minors with a felony ——
child pornography—— unless they at-
tended classes to convince them that
sextingwas wrong and also went on
probation, according to Reuters.

This approach‘ has  
problem. I L

First,  pornography statutes,
. intend to protect children from be-

ing victimized by the sorts of shady

— characters who take pictures of na-

ked kids.

But in this case, the perpetra-
tors of the pornography were also
its victims. _ ‘

The crime committed was essen-

 tially a crime against oneself. Does
a this mean we should prosecute smok-

ers for involuntary manslaughter and
reckless endangerment?
Worse, felony charges simply do

not vanish.

If you are a convicted felon, even

V better, if you are a convicted sex felon

with minors somehow involved, boy,
are you hosed.
The minors would have to regis-

ter as sex oifenders. They wouldn’t
be able to live in certain places, and

colleges and employers would ﬁnd
their criminal records an interest-
ing read. .

In short, it was horrible even
to threaten these girlswith felony

charges for what amounts to child-

ish behavior. ’ -

_ Enterthestate legislature. House
Bill 2189, introduced by Rep." Seth
Grove, R-York, would make sexting
a secorid—degree misdemeanor if the
perpetrator is younger than 18.

The bill attempts to clarify a cor-

V net of the legal code: Sexting simply

wasn’t possible in the Paleolithic —
er, pre—cell phone age.

Right now, if a DA will charge
somebody with a crime, the charge
must be under a lewdness, harass-
ment or child pornography statute.

This bill does do an admirable
thing, namely, take away the power
of overzealous prosecutors.

. _The bill is also fairly clear, and the
wording leaves no doubt about what
to call, say, a 17-year-old sending pho-

‘ tos of a 6-year-old —— rightﬁilly, child

pornography.

Perhaps the bill is necessary, after
all. The clarity is to be greatly ap-
preciated. .

But that doesn’t make the bill any
less silly. There’s still that part of the
bill that makes it a crime to do things
to yourself.

The purpose of a criminal code

should be to prevent people from
harming, or potentially harming,
other people.

Can sexting harm others? Yes,
but —— though I risk my status as a
card—carrying member of the Vast
Right-W'mg Conspiracy for saying so
— Witold Walczak of the American
Civil Liberties Union has a point.

He said that if sexting_happens
without the consent of one of the
parties involved, the state can apply
harassment and stalking statues.

This bill also has a perversity.

It’s a crime to send photos of
yourself on a cell phone, but not a
crime to pose for photos that your
buddy shoots. That means whether
you are treated as a criminal or avic—
tim largely depends on who sends
the photos.

Fundamental inconsistency also
stems from age of consent.

Section3122.1 ofthe Pennsylvania
Consolidated Statutes deﬁnes statu-
tory rape as sex between someone
younger than 16 and someone more
than four years older. V

So it’s perfectly legal for two mi-
nors older than 16 to see each other

naked, provided the means of the
viewing are not electronic.

The biggest question of all is, how
much of a deterrent effect will this
bill have on undressed, unthinking
youth? After all, if the idea that a
“sext” might be broadcast to an au-
dience of thousands of people over
the Internet doesn’t scare you, why

’ would the abstract thought of arrest

do any better? 

Making something illegal does
not mean making it stop. It’s also
possible that making sexting illegal
would make it the new underage
drinking.

It’s already risqué and titillating,
and if it’s illegal, our youngjames
Dean wannabes might be drawn to
it.

Even though this bill might be
necessary to prevent the conviction
of minors on charges of felonious idi-
ocy, sexting shouldn’t be considered
misdemeanor idiocy either.

The bill might not be a bad idea,
but it’s still silly.

Families are a difﬁcult subject.

We love them, we hate them, we
need to live with them or we want
to get away from them.

But photographer Katrina M.
d’Autremont doesn’t shy away from
exposing family issues. Instead,
she lets us get up close and per-
sonal with her own family.

Photos from her exhibit “Si
Dios Quiere” (If God Wants), cur-
rently displayed at the Silver Eye

Center for Photography, explore
the dynamics of space between
relationships and generations all
within a time span of two weeks
spent in her family’s apartment in
Argentina.

In “Abuelo y Maria Esther,” a
couple sits on opposite ends of
a couch with deadpan faces as
d’Aurtemont’s face reﬂects in the
window from across the room. This
family is all in one room, but with
nothing left to say.

“Closer proximity to the people
we love can be just as complex as
distance,” she said in her artist
statement.

The Philadelphian artist won
the Silver Eye’s 2009 Fellowship
Competition, which includes a cash
award and three month exhibition
at the gallery. She competed against
186 other submissions from among

32 states.

Fellowship juror Andy Adams,
editor of Flak Photo, describes
d’Aurtemont’s photos as “a shoe-

REVIEW

A ‘Valentine’s Day’ date to quickly forget

Another “Love Actually ” imitator falls on its face.

Kieran Layton
A t3 E Editor

“Valentines Day” '
Starring: Ashton Kutcher, Jennifer Garner,

. Jamie Foxx, countless A—List stars

Director: Garry Marshall A
Warner Bros.
Grade: C—

It is wholly appropriate for the experience
of watching a ﬁlm about Valentine’s Day to be
equivalent to that of eating a box of assorted
chocolates.

Sometimes, you strike gold with a truffle or

' a caramel, but more frequently, you get slapped

in the taste buds with a disappointing butter-
cream. Or a coconut'— nothing is worse than
the dreaded coconut—ﬁlled chocolate.
Unfortunately, the aptly named — and
perfectly timed — “Valentine’s Day’~’ is more
coconut chocolate than anything else. With
an A—list cast more varied than the most ran—
domized box of chocolates and a script that

borrows a little too heavily from the superior

ensemble holiday ﬁlm, “Love Actually,” the
ﬁlm provides some basic romantic thrills while
inevitably leaving a horribly sweet aftertaste
once it’s over. ,
Weaving together the narrative’s strands of
a group of too"—pretty—for—reality Los Angeles

residents, the entire superﬁcial spectrum of '

love and romance is represented throughout
“Valentine’s Day.” Blossoming stages of a new

relationship? Check. Cutesy adolescent crush— ‘

es? Got it. Geriatric marriage that is almost too.
syrupy sweet to tolerate? You know it.

t Describing in detail the speciﬁcs of all the
characters’ stories would be doing the ﬁlm a
disservice. Much of the fun in watching the
 —— and there isn’t a lot of fun togo
around  is seeing how everyone connects
and crosses paths. Even then, however, the
contrived meet—cutes and awkward dialogue
limits the enjoyment factor severely.

. One thing “Valentine’s Day” deﬁnitely has
going for it is the cast. Think of A-listers you
would like to see in a ﬁlm, and they’re prob-
ably in the movie. Ashton Kutcher andjennifer
Garneranchor most of the movie, and Taylor

ensuring no one makes it out alive.

2) “Groundhog Day” (1993). Bill Murray
plays a Pittsburgh weatherman who, by virtue
of a snowstorm, gets stranded in Punxsutaw—
ney, Pennsylvania, and subsequently, a time
loop — one that’s eerily similar to last week’s
cycle of school cancellations. In this ﬁlm,
the cold is both an antagonist and Murray’s

saving grace — if it wasn’t for that storm,’

he might never have changed his ways and
hooked up with Andie MacDowell.

3) “The Day After Tomorrow” (2004).
Okay, so maybe this isn’t a great movie, or
even a good movie, but I’ve included it be-
cause it takes the notion of “cold as avillain”
to new literal heights — at the end of the ﬁlm
(spoiler alert, I guess)lthe cold actually chases
characters down a hallway. It’s a climax both

if,--ridiculous and compulsively entertaining,
A and, if nothing else, it certainly beats Mark

Wahlberg running away from angry wind in
“The Happening.” . A

4) “Star Wars: Episode V — The Empire
S_trikes Back” (1980). Skywalker and friends
braved many hostile planets in their galaxy-
spanning adventures, and my favorite was
Hoth, the small, bleak ice world seemingly
locked in a perpetual blizzard.‘ And as if a
face-off with an abominable snowman wasn’t
thrilling enough, Lucas sets the planet’s frigid

backdrop as the stage for the most epic battle
of the series.

6) “The Edge” (1997). There are badass
movies, and then there are movies that make
badass movies seem like “The Notebook.”
“The Edge” is of the latter variety. When a
plane carrying Anthony Hopkins, Alec Bald-
win and Harold Perrineau (Michael from
“Lost”) crash—lands into the remote slopes
of Alaska, the three men must fend for their
lives as nature closes in. Winter weather,
raging rapids and, most famously, a gigantic,
super—intelligent grizzly bear make this ﬁlm
a frigid testosterone fest.

7) “Into the Wild” (2007). An all-time
favorite of mine, Sean Penn’s true-life story
of a boy who ventures into the Alaskan wil-
derness and dies, captures the north in its
bipolar essence — both beautiful and ter-
rible. Adventurers be warned.

8) “Fargo” (1996). While the Coen Broth-
ers have had a long and illustrious career,
“Fargo” — a tale of murder in the white-
washed northern Midwest —— remains, to
me, their most memorable for three reasons:
the instantly likeable protagonist (Frances
McDormand), the wood chipper scene (watch
it), and the iconic setting. There’s something
about barren landscapes that makes for wick-
edly good camera shots. A classic.

Pitt holds on for second Big East win

_,Brittan.ey Thomas scored a career-high 22 pointscoming off the bench to lead the Panthers to a. 72-69 win. yesterday

Jamie Martina I STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER

Taneisha Harrison scored 11 points in the win against Louisville.

Torie Wytiaz
Staﬁ” Writer

Wearing pink uniforms and shoes‘

as part of the Pink the Pete event,
the Pitt women’s basketball team
secured its first home victory of
the new year.

The game served as a breast
cancer research fundraiser, and
the Panthers held on for the 72-
69 win yesterday against Louis-
ville, improving their record to
13-11 and 3-9 in the Big East.

The last time the Panthers
won at home was a 57-47 win Dec.
31 against Mount St. Mary’s.

The game opened with some
offensive struggles for both sides,
but Taneisha Harrison recorded
the first score of the game after
roughly two and a half minutes
of scoreless play.

Points seemed to ﬂow a bit
more freely after that, especially
for Pitt’s Brittaney Thomas.

Thomas turned in a 22-point
performance, which was not only
a game-best, but also her career
high. The junior’s previous high
was 18 points.

Pitt coach Agnus Berenato
praised Thomas’ willingness to
take a leadership role on the of-
fensive side of the ball.

“Thomas stepped up and
showed no fear on the court,”

Berenato said. “It really looked
like she wanted the shot.”

Thomas said her teammates
recognized her scoring presence,
as well.

“Everyone was telling me
to just take the shot,” Thomas
said. “I could feel that I was in the
ﬂow of the game so I just turned
it on.”

Despite Thomas’ stellar per-
formance, the game remained
close as the Panthers and Cardi-
nals (11-14,.3—9) played at a tied
score five times and exchanged
leads six times.

The Panthers have had diffi-

culty in closing out games, most.

recently in a three-point loss to
Georgetown, but Berenato was
determined to stop that trend.

“In practices after the George-
town game, we worked on finish-
ing,” Berenato said. “That one
possession loss to Georgetown
really hurt us.”

Yesterday, Pitt experienced
the winning side of a close game,
and Louisville suffered the de-
feat. V ‘

With just morethan one min-
ute remaining in the game, the
Panthers held a 68-67 lead over
the Cardinals, and clutch re-
bounding and free—throw shoot-
ing allowed the Panthers to close
out the contest.

Chelsea Cole and Shayla Scott

both hit two foul shots in the ﬁnal
minute of the game, and each of
those opportunities came from
rebounding efforts. ‘

Balanced scoring proved to be
important for both the Panthers
and the Cardinals, as Thomas,
Harrison and Jania Sims fin-
ished with double—digit point
totals and four of Louisville’s
ﬁve starters contributed more
than 10 points. ’

‘Forward Monique Reid led the
Cardinals with 20 points, where-
as center Keshia Hines chipped
in 17 points. .

Becky Burke and Shelby
Harper rounded out the Cardi-
nal scoring with 15 and 11 points,
respectively.

But the Panther bench, thanks
mostly to Thomas, out—scored
the Cardinal bench 26-2 in the
game. Q

The production generated
from Pitt’s bench was necessary,
especially as Shawnice “Pepper”
Wilson and Scott scored below
their scoring averages as a result
of reduced playing time because
of foul trouble.

Thomas might have led the
Panthersin scoring, but Berenato
stressed the importance of other
statistical categories in the vic-
tory.

“I was very happy to see a 13
in the assist column,” Berenato

WWVU win shows growth for young Panthers

Kyle Craig
Staff Writer

It seems unfair that Friday night’s

three-overtime Pitt-West Virginia

game only accounts for one victory
:_ the win-loss column.

However, if this young group of

Panthers can retain the lessons they

learned fromthis particular Backyard
Brawl, the Pittbasketball teamwillbe
just ﬁne heading into the ﬁmire.

Sometime between the opening
tip—off and the ﬁnal whistle three
hours later, the Panthers gained the
conﬁdence and poise of an elite bas-
ketball team and walked off the court
with a 98-95 victory.

There is no better example of in-

game growththan redshirt freshman
Travon Woodall, who came off the
bench to accumulate 12 points, seven
rebounds and six assists.

“The guy who really stood out
to me was Travon,” Pitt coachjamie
Dixon said. “He really played well. He
really playedwithin himselfand hewas
big forus in so many ways.”

A When Jermaine Dixon fouled out

of the game with 49 seconds left in
regulation, Woodall didn’t wilt under
the pressure of replacing the senior
guard. Instead, he sparked Pitfs come-
back with two conﬁdent drives to the
basket.

“[Woodall] played like a veteran
and I’m proud of him,” Jamie Dixon
said.

Listed at 5-foot-11, Woodall spent

some possessions defending West
Virginia’s 6-foot—9 forward Devin
Ebanks. While Woodall didn’tstuffthe
Mountaineer big man, he did display
resilience and grit.

“It was a tough matchup, but it’s

not the size of the player, it-’s the size ,

of your heart,” Woodall said.
Woodall’s sentimentcanbe applied
to his teammates as well. Over three

Olympics are last straw for relationship with NBC

Opting to show ice dancing instead of the USA—Canada hockey game is a mistake worthy of giving up every type of “Law £5’ Order”

Greg Trietley
Staff Writer

NBC, we need to talk.

Sometimes I like you. You give me “The
Office” and several kinds of “Law & Or-
der.” ‘

But sometimes you infuriate me. You
told the Penguins they couldn’t set up their
big—screen party in the playoffs last year
because you didn’t want local ratings to
drop.

You cut away from the second overtime
of a playoff game between the Buffalo Sa-
bres and’ New York Rangers to show the
Kentucky Derby pre-race coverage. I know
you have a thing for that shot of the sun ris-
ing over aracetrack as a man in a baseball
cap tends to the horse that made it against
all odds, but it could’ve waited.

And, NBC, when you opted to nationally
televise ice dancing over the much—antici_—
pated United States-Canada hockey game

on Feb. 21, well, that was the last straw,
i

I’m breaking up with you. Yeah, Valen-
tine’s Day was just yesterday, but what did
you want me to do? I gave you one last day
together with me, but you kept showing
video of the Georgian luger’s fatal crash
instead. .

Don’t cry, NBC! I know my sport is on
MSNBC. But how do you think my friends
who don’t have that cable network feel?
And what about Chris Matthews? You’re
so selﬁsh sometimes, always thinking of
yourself ﬁrst.

Go run offon your night of ice dancing,
skiing and women’s speed skating. Tape
delay whomever you want. Use some sen-
timental montages for that girl who hurt
herself but recovered just in time. See if
I care. I always thought the ice dancers’
choice of music was subpar. Subpar! And
their outﬁts are tacky.

But at least you’ll be able to display the
American duo’s vibrant teal get—ups in high
deﬁnition. You come in high deﬁnition at
no extra cost to most cable and satellite
plans, but MSNBCHD doesn’t. I’m stuck

extra periods the Panthers willed their way to a
victory over the No. 5 team in nation.

“We didn’t play great butwe playedwith heart.
We played with character,”]amie Dixon said.

That character was reﬂected in the play of
Ashton Gibbs, who had struggled mightily in
recent Big East contests but came alive against
Pitt’s biggest rival.

Gibbs scored 24points while knocking down
six 3—pointers, including the dramatic basket
that drew the game level with 24 seconds left in
the second half. ‘

What shouldn’t be forgotten is this team’s
youth. Gibbs is a sophomore, Woodall is afresh-

manandoutsideof]ermaineDixon,Pittdoesn’t O

rely on any seniors for a signiﬁcant amount of
minutes.

“They’ve been told for the last r1ine_ months
how young they are and how inexperienced they
are and I continue to tell them that those things
don’t matter,”Jamie Dixon said. “We’ve got to play
olderthanwhat we looklike on paper. Freshmen
can’t play like freshmen.” ,

The inexperienced critique is one that the
Panthers shouldn’t face after Friday njght’s
contest. For anyone who saw the game, it can
certainly be described as an experience.

It is an experience that most of the Pitt roster
can carry into the ﬁlture. It is a game that can be
pointed to asa deﬁning moment.

“I really feel this team, probably more than
any team we’ve ever had, is a team that can get
better,” Dixon said.

Dixon isn’t using “coach—speak” or employ-
ing a motivational tactic —— he’s stating his true
belief. The victory over West Virginia was just
another step toward Dixon’s Vision, but it was
a colossal step.

On Friday night, Pitt showed what it takes to
be considered a successful basketball program.
It takes a commitment to improvement and a
consistent unwillingness to lose.

NBC neglecting to show

watching hockey in standard deﬁnition. Do
you know how hard it is to follow the puck!?
I’m about ready to become a football fan.

And what’s all this about your reason
why you chose ice dancing over my good
friend hockey? I read that you hoped these
Olympics would lure in the casual female
viewer.ﬁrst and foremost. Really, NBC? I
can’t believe you were on the prowl when
we were still together. I know what “casual
female” means. -

; Yeah, NBC, the Kentucky Derby an
the Olympics are the two sporting events
in which women viewers outnumber male.
Sure, I’m not going to buy the Olympic
sponsors" life insurance policy or lease a
car, but I’ve bought chips and pop off of
your recommendations for years. What
about me? Am I just some Conan you think
you can kick to the curb?

And wh-at about your friendship with the
NHL‘? You two signed a prenup. Your deal
splits all advertising revenue between the
two of you. You were supposed" to grow the
game together. You can’t do that if Olympic
hockey’s on the USA Network.

The NHL took a two week break so_ you
could showcase its stars in primetime.

     

There’s no point to the stoppage if you
aren’t going to hold up your end of the
bargain. Hockey’s been good to you. I hope
you’re enjoying all that revenue the Winter
Classic keeps bringing in.

I can understand why Finland-Sweden
is on MSNBC after Canada—.United States

ends. The average dude’s four-second at-.

tention span isn’t drawn in by the stellar
cyclealong the boards by the Sedin twins.
But ﬂash SIDNEY CROSBY, AMERICA and
something like THE BLOODBATH IN B.C.———
SPONSORED BY FORD on your screen and
you havea winner. ~ ‘T

The game on Feb. 21 features two big

nations playing in the Winter Olympics’-

prerrliere sport. Ice dancing can wait; NBC,
you have 18 preliminary round games this
coming week and only one is on you — and
it’s Russia—Czech Republic.

That’s almost as bad a decision as the
acronym MSNBCHD.

have nothing to do this week, feel free to

said. “We have been lacking in that area
on the stat sheet recently.”

Pitt and Louisville, both struggling to
find success in the Big East, also shared a
tendency to turn the ball over many times
in the course of the game.

In fact, the Cardinals and the Pan-
thers occupied the bottom two spots in
the Big East turnover margin per game

Berenato attributes some of those turn-
overs to an early rush of excitement in
the Panthers.

“In the first half, we really needed to
settle down and take care of the basket-_\
ball,” she said. “I don’t know if it was the
pink shoes, but everyone was excited to
play this game.”
