Morale

Br AI. MAVRINAC A
Dr. John Oliver, professor

of history and head of the spe- - in ,
cial morale committee of the , '

University Defense council,
today described student mor-
ale as “excellent.”

He also announced that ﬁve stu- , 

dents had been chosen to assist the
committee.

Rejecting recent criticism of stu-
dent attitude within the University,
Dr. Oliver disclosed that his com-
mittee, at a special meeting last
week, has carefully investigated
the student morale problem.

He said that few students were
reported unwilling to cooperate
fully with the Pitt defense effort,
and the"committee’s sources of in-
formation were termed “the best
possible.”

’ By its report, the morale com-
mittee indirectly rejected reported
observations of poor: morale among
students and faculty members. Ac-
cording to comments from some
-students, they believed the major-
ity of men and women at Pitt were

University officials said that an
accurate estimate of student mor-
ale was very difficult to measure
because students have not been
given a chaisce to do something
towards the defense effort.

Defense training courses, ' first
aid instruction and knitting clubs
have been “well received,” they
said. ' V
‘ "Despite the apparent certainty
of the committee that morale was
high; students were invited to com-
ment through special representa-

- tives appointed by the dean of men

and dean of women.

The five students appointed
Monday were Jean Brink, presi-
dent of ‘Women's Self Government
association; Harold Byer, C42;
Jack de Benedictis, C42, editor of
the Pitt News; Ed Tait, BA42,
president of the Student-Faculty
association, and Alma Nicholas,
C43.

Students named above will meet
with the committeeto ‘supply the
members with information on mor-
ale from ‘the student viewpoint.

The closing of the 1942 Owl un-
der graduate sales campaign on Fri-
day and details of the character
sketch of the “typical Pitt girl”
were announced today by the Owl
staff.

0 Don Lingenfelter, BA44, assist-
ant circulation manager, said that
the $1 deposit on the total $3.50
price of the yearbook may be
made either at the table in the
ground floor elevator lobby, in the
Owl office, 803 Cathedral, or di-

rectly with any of the 32 under-
graduate salesmen.

Salesmen may be identiﬁed by
gold and blue .“1942 Owl Sales-
men” ribbons which they wear.

The character sketch of the. “typi-
cal Pitt girl” will be a feature of
the 1942 yearbook. “Before the
sketch can be completed,” John
Brosky, C42, editor, said, “it is
necessary to know what the typical
girl is like.” Brosky has asked men
students to submit answers to the
following questions, in a sealed
envelope, to the Owl office by Fri-
day.

Universities Adopt Shorter Courses; ‘     
56 Percent of Students Approve -1. 

The -University, which on Mon-
day annouhced that trimesters
would probably be adopted for the
duration, was not alone in its hesi-
tancy in making that decision. The
American college mind generally is
dubious over the expediency of this

issue, even though colleges and
.unive1-sities in every part of the

country are adopting the shorter
course plan.

A majority of only" 56 percent
of the American, college students
believe the speedup will benefit
the students themselves, according
to the national poll conducted last
weelc by Student Opinion Surveys
of lmerica. SOS reports that tlie
nation's students are opposed to

such. a program as a post-war, _

“What is the appearance of the
‘typical Pitt girl?’ What activities
does she engage in at school? Does
she date and how often? What
kind of a student is she? What do
other students think of her? In

short, what is her personality? The.»

answers to these questions andyany
others the students may care to add
will be appreciated by the Owl
staff," Brosky added.

Theme of the yearbook is “Hand
in Hand at Pitt,” and each of the
six sections are introduced by two-
toned photographs of hands sym-
bolic of that division.

One section is devoted to the
freshman, sophomore and junior
classes. Oﬂicers and popular\mem-
bers of each class as well as in-
formal campus shots will be in-
cluded in this section.

Any student having photographs
and information of Pitt men in
service has been requested to bring
a picture together with the name,
rank, branch of service and post of

‘ the man, to- the Owl office, 803

Cathedral. J

two-thirds of those interviewed de-
clared that after the war is over
they would rather go to school a
full four years for their degrees.

Questions and answers in the
cross—sectional poll were:

“Some colleges are shortening‘
the time to get a degree from ‘four
to three years. Do you think this
will be beneficial or not to students
themselves ?”

Millay Poems r   
ln Ihllrcd Roomy ii

Ruth R. Haun, instructor ii
speech and director of the Wom-
en's Speech association, will read"
from the verse of Edna St. Vincent-
Millay today at 4 o'clock in tho,
Alldred room on the sixth ﬂoor.

Today’s reading hour is one of
a series conducted Wednesday af-
ternoons when students may hear
‘proseand poetry read and discuss-
ed by members of the speech fac-
ulty. .

Miss Haun, a member of the
speech advisory committee for the
Pennsylvania Forensic and Music"
league and author of “So You’re -
Reading Poetry,” believes that we 2
have been fed far too long on what 
Maxwell Anderson calls a “starva-
tion diet of prose.” ~

There have been many requeits 
for readings from Miss Millay’s"
sonnets and from her verse plays.
“By many,” Miss Haun says, “Ed- — =
na St. Vincent Millay is heralded‘ ,
as the twentieth century's first lady P 
of American. poetry.” ':
