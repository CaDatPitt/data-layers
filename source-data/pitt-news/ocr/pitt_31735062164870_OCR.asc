No Danger
OfUniversity
Closing Up

Acting Chancellor Stanton C.
Crawford denied that the Univer-
sity would have to literally close
its doors in December because of
the ﬁnancial crisis.

Dr. Crawford said that the tes-
timony of Trustee Frank R. Den-
ton to the state House Appro-
priations Committee last week
that the University would have
to fold if the state appropriation
were not forthcoming “was not to
be taken literally.”

Denton’s remark has been
widely quoted in the local news-
papers and has led to specula-
tion that instruction at the Uni-
versity was in danger of being
terminated. ’

The remark was not a part
of the prepared testimony, Dr.
Crawford said, and was made
merely for emphasis.

Poll Shows

Litchﬁeld
Backing

By ALAN DISLER

University students voiced
their support for Chancellor
Edward H. Litchﬁeld in a
random poll taken Monday
by The Pitt News. The ratio
of students in support of the
Chancellor to those opposed was
four to one.

Students were questioned in
the Cathedral, the Student Union,
the Towers snack bar, and the
dormitories as to how they would
rate the administration of Dr.
Litchﬁeld.

Ken Perry, engineering and
mines sophomore, said that the
Chancellor “may not be running
according to the budget, but he
is trying to improve the Univer-
sity.” However, “he may be go-

ing about it the wrong way by‘

not staying within the budget."

Barry Weinberg, sophomore in
liberal arts,’ gave Dr. Litchﬁeld
credit for making “Pitt a respect-
ed school. I have no complaints.”

The most favorable comment
was made by Jeff Apley, liberal
arts sophomore, who said that
“Chancellor ‘Litchﬁeld has done
more for this University in ‘the
past ten years than any other
chancellor has ever done in the
past hundred.”

Other students were more cri-
tical of Chancellor Litchﬁeld’s
administration. Jim Shilliday, a
liberal arts sophomore, said that
the Chancellor had handled mat-
ters “miserably” and that Chan-
cellor Litchﬁeld’s ﬁscal policy
was less far-sighted than his oth-
er plans.

CHANCELLOR LITCHFIELD
Receives Student Support

William Phelps, III, freshman
in liberal arts, stated that Chan-
cellor Litchﬁeld has expanded the
University to a far more respect-
ed institution but has been “ex-
traordinarily irresponsible in run-
ning the University into a def-
icit.”

Robert Van Naarden, an en-
ginering sophomore, said that
the Chancellor has done a “pretty
good job in general but it’s his
own fault that the University has
gone to pot ﬁnancially. The Uni-
versity will not rot if Litchﬁeld
leaves,” he added.

Virtually all students acknow-
ledged the growth the University
has undergone under Dr. Litch-
ﬁeld. The difference in opinion
arose from the relative impor-
tance given to the ﬁnancial sit-
uation.

Thirty-four students were p‘5ll-
ed, with 22 supporting the Chan-
cellor, or 64.7 per cent; ﬁve or
14.7 per cent .against; and seven
or 20.6 per cent undecided.

Students
  Support

Chancellor  

A student petition, aimed

at giving Chancellor Edward -  
Litchﬁeld a vote of confi-

dence, is presently being cir-

culated at the University by '
members of the student body, ~
aroused by trustee Frank Den---'
ton’s speech before the state‘
House Appropriations Committee."

_ According to Donald Friedman, ‘
undergraduate spokesman for the

petitioning group, the petition

has a two-fold purpose: to ex-  
press student support for and 
conﬁdence in Chancellor Litch-  1-:
ﬁeld; and to provide positive ‘ 
publicity for the University dur-"

ing this current crisis.

In conjunction with this peti-
tion, a rally was held last night
in the quadrangle. The purpose
of this meeting was to coalesce

student support for the Ch.ancel- it 
especially from those stu- '_

lor,
dents who were not reached by
the petitions.

The group, Friedman continued, _ ,

does not believe that the Chan-

cellor is totally without fault, but  

rather wants to stress the im-

provements and contributions 1 

made by the Chancellor. The

group objects to the Chancellor's . if ”

becoming the sole bearer of the
blame of the ﬁnancial .crisis.

The petition was started by  

Robert Cunningham, LA, ’66,

Saturday night. Complementing it . 1 at 
is an open letter to the Board of " “

Trustees which was also distri-
buted. for signatures" and which

appears in an advertisement in -

Ten Year Report

University Growth Cited

(This is the second in a series of articles on the p'rog'ress_ of
the ~Unz've'rsz'ty as contained in “Report to the Community,

1955-1965.”) .

Expansion has been one of the main themes of the past
ten years at the University This has meant expansion in
faculty, in schools and in physical plant. ‘

The new buildings which have doubled the university’s
acreage include the Student Union, Schenley quadrangle,
dormitories, Book Center, and offices and The Towers dormi

tories. The University may now
house 3,400 students as com-
pared with 100, ten years ago.

The Graduate School of Pub-
lic Health, Langley and Clapp
Halls (parts of a natural science
quadrangle), Engineering Hall,
Sarah Mellon Scaife Radiation
Laboratory and Van de Graaf .ac-
celerator, newly-opened Space Re-
search Coordination Center, and
Scaife Hall, are part of the new
academic facilities.

Trees Hall pool and adjoining ,

physical education building and
playing ﬁelds complete the upper
campus. The Frick Fine Arts
Building and $11 million Ilillman
Library will complete the lower.

_ Despite insufficient space li-
brary holdings have increased by

168 (per cent in 11 years, cir_cula- _ — ‘

tion by 233 per cent, and staff by
320 per cent. The I-Iillman Li-
brary will contain space for 1,-
750,000 volumes (a 600,000 ‘book
increase) and 2,200 reader spaces.
Still, a committee reported in
February that facilities and rate
of growth of the University li-
brary were inadequate for im-
mediate and future use.

Expansion has not been only
in the area of physical plant,
however. Three schools, three de-
partments and 17 programs have
increased the University’s capaci-
ty for instruction and research.

The Graduate School of Pub-
lie and International Affairs was

Photo Clinic
Aids Youths

The University-sponsored Photo-
graphy Clinic has been training
32 high school seniors from the
tri-state area in two 16 member
sessions during the past two
weeks. The purpose of the clinic
is to develop needed imaginative
photographers for high school
publications, by teaching the stu-
dents to use their cameras to
ﬁnd an insight into human ex-
periences.

The daily three-hour sessions --

include lectures, shot assign-
ments, and darkroom work, as
well as work with University
photographers, the Photo Club,
administrators, and two profes-
sionals, Bud Harris, visual direc-
tor of the Jones and Laughlin
Steel Research Division, and
Herb Ferguson, director of the
University‘s Medical Illustration
Laboratory.

The clinic received over 40 ap-
plications, and is now in its sec-
ond week-long session. Those at-
tending the clinic are required

to return to their high schools‘

as photographers’ for their news-
papers and yearbooks during
their senior year.

Awards will be given at a con-
cluding banquet this Friday for
all-around excellence in the cate-
gories of campus scenes, por-
traits, athletics, and theatrics, in
a contest sponsored by the Divi-
sion of Public Relations.

Tech, Playhouse Cooperate

Conservatory Theater Comes to Pittsburgh .

By BERNIE McLEOD

Dressed in _a madras-red
sports shirt, the 17th cen-
tury character, Argon, furi-
ously paced the stage of the
Craft Theatre. Before him
stood Tartuffe’s messenger,

-in a pair of cut-down jeans. The

scene was an early morning re-
hearsal of Moliere’s comedy, Tar-
tuffe, the ﬁrst presentation of
the American Conservatory The-
atre, to open tomorrow, formed in
cooperation with the Pittsburgh
Playhouse and Carnegie Institute
of Technology.

In the United States, a com-
pany such as ACT is unique,
founded upon the European tra-
dition of the conservatory where
those in the theatre arts can re-
ceive formal training while per-
forming with a professional com-

pany. While at the Pittsburgh I

Playhouse from July to Decem-

 - ber, ACT will present repertory

theatre seldom practiced in our
country. Accordingly, by ‘using

both the Craft and Hamlet Street
Theatres of the Pittsburgh Play-
house, the plays can be alter-
nated every few nights, perrr1it-
ting an individual to see'ﬁve or
six new plays in one week.

Supported by a grant from the
Rockerfeller Foundation, the proj-
ect will hopefully teach the ac-
tor versatility in theatre work.
According to Production Coordi-
nator Edward Hastings, “The 75
members of the company will
present not only popular plays,
but those that give them experi-
ence in many different types of
drama.” One night an actor may
play Shakespeare (King Lear),
the next a French comedy (Tar-
tuife) .and the next a modern
drama (Tiny Alice).

While acting, the ACT’s per-
formers will take classroom in-
struction in areas such as voice,
speech training, and acting tech-
nique. In addition, I dna-ma stu-
dents at Carnegie Tech will also
beneﬁt from the theatre project

Dr. Alan Anderson and Dr. Omar Khayyam Moore,

long-time research collaborators, will be at the University -

for the fall term.

Dr. Anderson will have appointments in philosophy, the
Knowledge Availability Systems Center, and the Philosophy

of Science center.

Dr. Moore's positions are in the Learning Research and Develop-
ment Center, the Philosophy of Science Center, and a tentative social

psychologr section.

Dr. Moore, a former Yale so-
xciologist, comes to the Universi-
ty directly from the psychology
department of Rutgers. Using a
unique “talking typewriter” that
has a standard keyboard, a small
speaker, a projector and dictation
equipment, he experiments with
the intellectual capabilities of
young children. The child is left
alone with the talking typewriter
to explore and teach himself
about the workings of the ma-
chine.

Dr. Anderson, a logician and
philosopher, has authored over
90 books, articles, and reviews.
He pursued his profession at
Yale prior to accepting a posi-
tion at the University.

Dr. Anderson assisted Dr. Moore

with the original experiment on.

An Open Letter to the Board of Trustees

In terms of the ideal purpose of a university, we the students
have a greater stake in the future of Pitt than anyone else, including V  
faculty, administration, ‘and even creditors. Unfortunately, practically Q I 

  everyone, except the students and a few enlightened faculty members I‘   I 
and administrators, has overlooked this basic fact. In the present situa-
tion, however, it demands much more emphasis.

Almost everyone willagree that the primary reason a student comes a
to a university is to getan education. Admittedlythere are those who
come for a degree, with the education being of secondary importance.

I To those of us who value the education we receive, and hopefully we
are in majority, the apparently imminent change to take place here at
Pitt has all the appearances of a minor catastrophe.

years are almost unbelievable. Senator Albert Pechan said recently that
Pitt has accomplished fifty years of improvement in only ten years. Jun-
iors noticed the obvious superiority of an incoming freshman class over
their own, although only two years had elapsed. The list can go on al-
most indefinitely. The one factor that all the improvements have incom-
mo-n is that each and every one of them can be traced back ultimately
to -ChanceIlorEdward Litchfield. Although we may not always show it or
express it, we are proud of the education we are being offered here.
For the quality of that education, in all its varied aspects, we are grate-
ful to Dr. Litchfield. _ I
In view of his importance to us, we find it most unfortunate that he
must now become a sacrificial lamb on the altar-of state/aid. It is true
that in his sometimes over-zealous attempts to improve our lot, Dr. I
Litchfield has made his enemies in Harrisburg. But must politics enter
even into the area of education? Is it necessary to hand him over in re-
turn for the aid we so desperately need? Education should be more
important to the state legislators than another political scalp. You men
are obviously more versed in the ways of the world than we students
are, but we hope that your actions were not deemed a necessity based
onthe experiences you have had. There is still plenty of timefor you to
explain the situation within its true perspective: one man—even Chan-
cellor Litchfield—cannot run a university by himself entirely without the g
approval of the Board of Trustees. To put the blame on Chancellor . 
Litchfield as was done before the House Appropriations Committee   ' I
is grossly unfair. g
In light of all the aforesaid, we the students, having the most at
I stake in this matter, wish to see no further harm come to the Chancellor,
either in reputation or, more importantly, in his positionin the University.

Respectfully,

i‘ Communst -Party Line,”

   

 Unfortunately, a popular question among students, faculty, and ad-
“?"3'-‘iininistration is" “What happened to Student Government?" The answer is
'i“Absolutely nothing.” SG has failed to take any stand, failed to make any
;-ﬂstatement, failed to take any action in the name of the students. Student
Government has failed to govern.

 . In the student activities fee the SG first took a strong stand, de-

 manding that they alone be permitted. to control t_he distribution of funds
to the various organizations. As soon as the Board of Trustees approved
[._ ' a‘ slightly different version of the proposal, however, SG just folded up and
":5. died. No further action was taken.

And no action has been taken in any other area throughtout the en-

      am... si.....l...-ml     

Student involvement and independence were the keynotes of the
‘St'udent_ Government (SG) presidential election in February. The results
of theelection found a party viewed by some as too radical the overwhelm-
{ing winner. The events of this trimester have been ideal for a party and a
Mjgjovernment which loudly proclaim the rights of the students.

tire summer. The natural answer of the SG people is that they do not have
anyone on campus this‘ trimester, including Eric Stern, the president.
Stern's whole campaign was based on student participation in decision mak-
ing and in the affairs of the University generally.‘ Yet Stern has not

deemed any of the events of the summer. important enough for him to »

issue any statement.

The epitome of the SG abdication is their lack of action in the student
movement in support of Chancellor Litchfield. Student interest on the sub--
ject grew to the point where positive action from SG was definitely called

for. Members of SG have said that the students present at Thursday's

meeting were all in favor of some action favorable to the Chancellor, yet
nothing was done. ‘

V

"Student Government has become the missing link in the chain of
activities taking place on campus this trimester. Now, when it appears

that the students may finally be interested in something, is the time for

the members of SG, especially the executive, to forge that link.

means. He also fails to cite
the panel discussions before,
after, and during the cam-
paign. He neglects the pro
and con columns in The Pitt
News-, all of which expressed
numerous student views.

Besides his disregard for
student interest, the phan-
tom shows his further ig-
norance of the University by
asking professors to take an
oath. His naive request
would make the University
a vacuum, indoctrinating
students to a narrow-minded
philosophy.

Liberal education under-

scores the need to present

a myriad of different issues,
Ideas, opinions, and , con-

   

cepts. Professors fulfill the
function of presenting these
well - balanced approaches.
For instance, how can a pro-
fessor dealing with national-
ism ignore the Marxist doc-
trine?

How can any social science .

course be taught without ex-
posing communist, socialist,
democratic, and other ap-
proaches? A professor men-
tioning a communist princi-
ple or quoting a person pro-
fessing communism would,
in the phantom’s eyes, be a
communist.

Natural science and the
humanities could not be even
taught - properly .because
there are scholars who are
not adherents to the demo-
cratic principle. A scientist
from an undemocratic na-
tion could not have his work
taught in_the University. He
would be considered a non-

American, therefore his con-
tributions would undermine

the students, and the pro-
fessor wouldj  his agent.

Gin S1 Sympathy

Pitt on the Rocks
by Fred N. Frank

_ I had hoped that the conversation would not put me on
the defensive,‘ but a junior at the University becomes as
much a specialist in these matters as the average business
man when rumors spread about the affairs of Dr. Litch-
field, the Board of Trustees, and the community. .

We were standing at the bar, and it seemed like the
conversation might stay off the subject.

“Well, Fred, what’ll it be tonight. We have some good
Chivas Regal.” ' '

“No. Just some soda on ice. I’m driving tonight”

“Good, boy."

“Yea, sure.”'

“What year are you now?”

“I’m a junior at the University of Pittsburg .”

“At the University of Pittsburgh, did you say young -

man? Well shouldn't you say you were a junior. I hear your
school's closing up.” -» _

“Well, to tell you the truth, I just don’t expect it to.”

“That -heart attack of Litchﬁeld’s. Came very sudden-
ly. No one could get to the hearings with that kind of an
excuse.” ‘ L ’

“Doctors and cardio-electrograms don’t lie."-

“Y ou’ve seen them?’’

“No.”

“Neither have I.” .

“Well has your paper assigned someone to cover the
inauguration of the new chancellor. All the men at my club
say Litchfield is out for sure——and they know.”

“Yes George. Everybody knows what Litchfield is.
Tearing down buildings. Borrowing money. Running his
corporations when he should have been running Pitt. Why
the man's an egotistical maniac. Has no care what he does."

“Some people say this world _was built by egotistical
maniacs.”

“Now, now, Fred, don’t get all excited. No one meant to
insult the man. It's just the evidence is before us all. He
has simply ruined the University."

“Ruined the University. If you call ruining the Uni-
versity converting a street car school, where kids carry
their lunches in paper bags,_ into a University with out-
standing faculty, improved student body and more facilities,
then let's hope more schools will be ruined soon. Don't sup-
pose you caught Herb Stein's article about Litchfield in
the P-G.”

“Never read the Post-Gazette. Press is my kind of
paper. Anyhow, getting back to your friend Litchfield, I
hear that great physical education plant bf his costs one
dollar per square foot to maintain per day.”

“Did you ever try to figure out how much this party is
costing per square foot per hour? ~

“Money’s going everywhere except Pitt, ri_ght when it
made its problems public. People are sick of Litchfield.”

“That's probably quite true. Money can do anything
these days, even ruin a University.”

“I don’t see Pitt being ruined because Ed Litchfield’s
gone.”

“Well in the last analysis, the support of the faculty
and students is what counts. And Litchfield seems to be
getting that now.” »

“Who gives a darn about students and professors. It's
men with the money who count. P

Reader Defends
Litchfield’s Aim

Editor, The Pitt News:

It has become obvious that at
least one additional question
needs to be raised concerning the
status of various individuals with
reference to the ﬁnanéial crisis
of the University. It has been
agreed that the Board of Trus-
tees, as well as Chancellor Litch-
ﬁeld have made several errors
in judgment. Furthermore, Board
Chairman Gwilym Price has
stated ’ publicly that there is no
single scapegoat on whom the
blame can be placed for the
present situation.

Why, then, would Board Mem-
ber Frank R-. Denton, who is also.
chairman of the Budget-Audit
Committee, openly advocate the
character assassination of one
man, . Chancellor Litchﬁeld, and
in effect, shift the brunt of re-
sponsibility upon him? Mr. Den-
ton very nicely neglects to reveal

_from what position he is speak-

ing: personally, as a spokesman
for the Board of Trustees, or
could it be that he is acting as
asounding board for inﬂuential,
but narrow-minded “other inter-
ests?” ‘

Although Mr. Denton has been
chairman of the Budget-Audit
Committee only since 1963, he
has been a member of the Board
of Trustees since 1959. The con-
clusion \is that Chancellor Litch-
ﬁeld was allowed to prepare his
“unrealistic forecasts and oper-
ating budgets” without adequate
controls, which means such in-.
adequate controls were sanction- .
ed by, and arelthe responsibility
of, the Board of Trustees.

It would be almost impossible
for anyone to convince me that
one man, chancellor or not, could
be solely responsible for putting
this University $19.5 million in
debt. But, assuming the impos-
sible, I would then conclude that

ture and function of a Board of
Trustees should be ’ forthcoming.

Should Pitt lose Chancellor
Litchﬁeld as the result of a few
intelligent grown men refusing
to act as such, it would, in my
opinion, be a catastrophe of the
ﬁrst magnitude, and one that
would continue to reverberate
long after the present members
of the Board of Trustees have
departed from the scene.

Student Decries
Library Hours

Editor, The Pitt News:

Once again the University ad-
ministration has made an eco-
nomy move which affects under-
graduate and graduate students
alike. The Cathedral Library is
now closed on Sunday, and hours
have been reduced during the
week. I am quite surprised that
the students accept yet" another
reduction in library hours. The
administration explains the cut
as justified on the principle that
an insufficient number of stu-
dents were utilizing library fa-
cilities.

If the administration is truly
attempting to make Pitt a ﬁrst
class University (even under the
curfent ﬁnancial conditions), it
is difficult to understand how
the library can be operated on a
pure “cost” basis. I have often
wondered how accrediting asso-
ciations view continual reductions
in library availability.

If the administration is wor-
ried about the degree of alumni
cooperation evidenced in recent

months, it should perhaps realize
that today's students are tomor-
row’s unofficial public relations
spokesmen (telling friends and
potential students of their experi-
ences at Pitt), as well as alumni.

luctant to help the University at
this critical time, perhaps be-
cause they are aliented from the
policy-making process in which
they should rightfully have a
voice, among other reasons.

I suggest that the Student Gov-
ernment officers explore the pos-
sibility of using a small part of
the new student activities fee to
ﬁnance opening the library on
Sunday afternoons, or Friday
evenings, assuming there is suf-
ﬁcient student interest.

A  LOG: By Bill Cabiml .iii         
  Football Recruiting Falters;
  16 Freshmen Lead Squad

   Rejects   
Lead Softball Playoffs I

By GWRGE LIES

Intramural Softball has begun the first round of semi- .-
ﬁnals in a double elimination playoff for the league cham-

 

Football is the Univers-
ity’s top sport. Football
gives the University pres-

tige. Football gives the Uni-

versity money. Football is
dying at the University.
.Only 16 players have been re-
cruited for this year's freshman
football team. “We have 16 boys

"who" are receiving grants-in-aid

‘and; have already signed letters
of intent,” said assistant athletic
director Walt Cummins.

Letters of intent are agree-

'ments signed by incoming play-

ers, stating that the player can-
not go to either Penn ‘—‘-tate
Syracuse if he later dc. es 1
to come here. Penn State and
Syracuse have -imilar agree-
ments, which 1; .ibit players
from coming here  they decide
not to attend the school with
whom the letter of intent was
originally signed.

“There's still a possibility we
may get more,” said Cummins.
But it is now.-.-the middle of July
and last year's ﬁnal freshman
roster had been compiled by July
17. Last year’s frosh squad had
25 members, all receiving some
form of ﬁnancial aid.

The obvious excuse nowadays
is the University’s ﬁnancial di-
lemma. But ﬁnancial cutbacks
have not hindered recruiting.
“The football team had the same
amount of ﬁnancial .aid to work
with this year as last year,” said
Cummins. “They could have
brought in more.”

Stereotyped excuses are an ath-
letic department specialty. Fi-
nances couldn’t be blamed, so the
competition became the scape-
goat. “It’s just one of our rough-

er years," said Cummins. “Com-
petition has been rough recruit-
ing-wise.”

What the athletic department
fails to recognize is the football
team's record. In 1964, the varsi-
ty compiled a 9-1 mark. Last
spring 25 freshmen gridders were
recruited, including ﬁve from the
western part of the United States.

The main reasons for going
West were because Western Penn-
sylvania talent was being usurp-
ed by many top colleges and be-

cause of the school's increased

academic standards.
Schools from across the coun-

, try ﬁght annually for talent from

the athletically-rich WPIAL sec-
tions. Rising academic standards
have also made _it difficult for
coach John Michelosen tolﬁll his
roster from an area as small as
Western Pennsylvania.

The 9-1 record made the west-
ward move a’ success. The Uni-
versity received nationwide at-
tention for its squad’s perform-
ance, and had all-Americans Paul
Martha, Rick Leeson, and Ernie
Borghetti. It was ready-made
publicity.

This year the ‘coaching staff
had a 3-5-2 record as recruiting
publicity. In essence, they lost
some credibility as a football
power. Many high school pros-
pects had to weigh our offers
against those of schools like Syra-
cuse, Penn State,‘ Notre Dame,
and other consistent football pow-
ers.

The result of this poor recruit-
ing job are obvious. Two-platoon
football has become the norm, re-
quiring full offensive and defen-
sive squads. The frosh squad will
have 11 men on the ﬁeld with

‘Baseball Financial Aid Cut;

Lewis Recruits 3 Players

The University’s ﬁnancial dilemma has put recruiting
pressures on baseball coach Bobby Lewis. Lewis was given
three half-scholarships with which to build the nucleus of

a nine man team.

The aid has already been al-
loted to three area players: Dave
Welty of South Hills Catholic,
George McKenzie of St. Mary's
and Dave Jones, Langely High
School. Welty and Jones pitched
their teams to the Catholic and
City league championships, re-

' spectively:

,“When working with that
amount of aid I can’t afford the
luxury of making a mistake in
judging potential,” said Lewis.
“It’s hard, to say the least, to
get good players here without an
aid to offer. But even if I had
none to offer, I'd still have to

ﬁeld a team.”

McKenzie has played for two
years in the tough Greater Pitts-
burgh League. He has been a
consistent hitter against tough
pitching. Welty and Jones both
double as excellent hitters. “I
can’t afford the luxury of a one
position player any more,” said
Lewis.

ﬁve men in reserve. The result-
they’ll either get clobbered or the
freshman schedule will‘ have to
be dropped.

There are currently 20 seniors

men survive, the net loss will be
four players. However, this out-
look does not account for esti-
mates of freshmen injured, trans-
fers, or academic ineligibles. Per-
haps the football staff feels op-
timism can replace players.

Perhaps Athletic Director Frank
Carver’s ﬁnancial philosophy will
become a guideline for football.
“We’ll just have to get the maxi-
mum good out of what we get, ’
said Carver, considering a re-
evaluation of the athletic budget
and program in November.

Repercussions are too exten-
sive to follow a laissez-faire poli-
cy. The gridders play big-time
competition. Opponents include
Penn State, Syracuse, Navy, Okla-
homa, Notre Dame, West Vir-
ginia, and Southern California
All recruit on a large scale, with
20 player freshmen squads usual-
ly being a minimum.

For instance, last year's fresh-
man squad was lauded by coach
Bill Kaliden as the best since
1960. They‘ were clobbered by
Kent State which had a freshman
squad ranging from 50-70 players.
Although not all of Kent State’s
players were receiving ﬁnancial
aid, at least 30 were.

Compounding the athletic" de-
partment’s problems is a cut in
aid to other sports. Soccer coach
Leo‘ Bemis has been cut from
two full scholarships to one, and
baseball coach Bobby Lewis was
cut from three to one-and-a-half.

The athletic budget has ob-
viously been cut, but football was
spared. The department cut cor-
ners in other sports to supposed-
ly maintain our top reputation in
football. That reputation needs
more support than a 16 man
freshman squad.

_ In the ﬁrst round of t-he playoffs, Pi Lam beat Circle
K, 20-7. Harvey Katz, Mack Surrey, and Ed Zelnick hit

home runs for Pi Lam.

The Rejects scored one -run in the last of the sixth inn- .

ing, giving the Colts their fourth straight loss, 8-7. Bob
Carberry and Mike-Helmick contributed home runs to the

winner’s eight hit attack.

During the regular season, the
undefeated MBA Sweetmeats (6-
0) ﬁnished first, playing two
games less than second place Pi
Lambda Phi ('3-1).

The Counselors (6-2) ﬁnished
a strong third, while the GSPI-I
Colts, who lost their last three
games, dropped to fourth with a
mark of ﬁve Wins and three
losses.

The other ﬁnal standings were:
Circle K (3-4) and the Dent In-
lays tied for ﬁfth place; the
Dent Molars (2-4), seventh.. the
MBA Rejects (1-7), eighth;' and
Bratton’s Bruisers, ninth.

The collapse of the Colts was
the most surprising incident of
the second-half of the season.

First they met the Pi Lam on- __

slaught, losing 8-2, and getting
only four hits. Pi Lam's Zelnick
hit two home runs.

Against the ‘Sweetmeats, the
'Colts got eight hits, but strand-
ed eight runners, losing 8-1. Bill
Shanafelt hit a homer and Norm
Harriet connected for three sin-
gles, contributing to MBA’s eight
hits.

The Colts were tied with the
Counselors, 3-3 when Colt pitcher

program in urban renewal.

The School of General Studies,
started in 1961, curently offers
degree granting and informal
courses to 8,000 part-time eve-

‘ New departments created since
1955 include the Department of
Anthropology (1960), the Depart-
ment of Geology (1962), and the
Department of General Linguis-
tics (1964).

The Graduate School of Pub-
lic Health has added 11 areasof
concentration in the last decade.

Finally, sponsored research, an-
other area of the University’s
“commitment to excellence,” has

my hobby seems unusual. There
are many competitive pistol
shooters in the country,” he
added. 5

Rose began shooting without-

T formal lessons while in the Ma-

rine Corps in California. While at
Slippery Rock College he spent
much time on gymnastics, but
found “pistol shooting most sat-
isfying for personal achieve-
ment.”

On the National Marine Re-
serve riﬂe-pistol team since 1960,
he is also captain of a team
that competes throughout the
winter. Among’ other accomplish-
ments, he has been national re-
serve champion, received several
trophies, and earned the Navy
Times Award, presented by the
Navy-Marine Corp newspaper.

Rose will compete along with
other amateurs this August in
the National Pistol Champion-
ships at Camp Perry, Ohio. On
his vacation before the match,

Rose will again be on active Ma-
rine duty. During that time, he
will shoot competitively in Balti-
more; Quantico, Virginia, and In-
dianapolis.

In regards to Senator Thomas
Dodd’s (Dem.-Conn.) proposed
legislation, which would severely
restrict the sale of ﬁrearms, Rose
felt that this “will do nothing
to curtail their» illegal use.” He
suggested that stricter penalties
for crimes involving guns might
reduce the number of such
crimes.

Rose, who came to the Univer-
sity in 1962, feels that weapons
are misused because the" public
“holds misconceptions about
shooting. The TV sharpshooter
creates, in anything, a disrespect-
ful attitude toward ﬁrearms,
since he uses a gun indescrimin-
ately,” he commented.

In addition, Rose felt that
familiarity with guns may cut
down the number of accidents
that occur each year. The Na-
tional Riﬂe Association is one or-
ganization operating to educate
those interested in the safe han-
dling of guns.

Gersh<win’s Porgy and Bess

By ROBERT HOROWITZ
With the moan of the blues, the Civic
Light Opera’s production of George Ger-
shwin’s Porgy and Bess began its run at

the Civic Arena. The story of Porgy and.

Bess is not based on an actual person as
legend now has it. DuBoisHeyward wrote
this touching story about a crippled beggar
win, reading Heyward’s novel, felt it was the
vrom the streets of.Charleston and George Gersh
basis for a true “American Oper.a.”

After its world premiere in Bostbn and New
York in 1935, critics referred to it as Gersh-
win’s “Rhapsody in Black." Because of the pop-
ularity of the melodies from this opera, Porgy
and Bess reopened in New York in 1942.

Like the beginning of a fantasy, Porgy and
Bess opens with the soothing lullaby “Summer-
time” as Catherine Eason, as Clara, slowly
draws the audience into a world that is far
from "everyday life. We are drawn into an area
known as Catﬁsh Row, a Negro ghetto in the
South. It is in Catﬁsh Row where LeVern
Hutcherson as the legless Porgy falls in love
with the beautiful Bess.

In the first scenes we see strongman Crown,
as portrayed by John Mccurry, commit a mur-
der. Crown is forced to flee leaving Bess, his
dope addicted mistress. Because of her sinninx
ways, as portrayed by Martha Flowers, Bess is
not accepted by any of the women in the com-
munity. Her only hope for safety is in the pro-
tective arms of the crippled Porgy.

A month later, the community goes on a
picnic. Before they leave, Porgy announces his
love for Bess in ‘the song “Bess You Is My
Woman Now.” At the end of the picnic, Crown
returns and seduces Bess. .

The meeting with Crown causes Bess to be-
come ill, Her recovery does not mean the be-
ginning of good times. A terrible hurricane oc-
curs, wherein Clara’s husband, Jake (Gordon
Watkins), and a few of the other young men of
Catﬁsh Row, lose their lives.

It is during this storm that Porgy and Crown
have their first confrontation. That meeting
leads to the fateful ﬁght where the half-man
kills the murderous he.-man. Meanwhile, Cab
Calloway as Sportin' Life makes off with Bess.
She has dropped dope and turned to God, but
under Sportin’ Life's Inﬂuence she returned to
sin.

When Porgy hears that Bess has gone away
despite his handicap, and his devotion to the
people of Catﬁsh Row, he starts on his journey
to ﬁnd her with the song “Pm on My Way.”

The cast is led by the sensational Cab Callo-
way who brings to life the dandy dope-peddling
Sportin’ Life. His rendition of “It Ain't Neces-
sarily So” rings with the feel of a disciple of
the devil. Catherine Eason sends chills up and
down one’s spine as she sings “Summertime.”
Martha Flowers as Bess and Carol Brice .as
Maria give performances that complement the
Opera. The Civic‘Light Opera has successfully
brought out the true rhythm of America’s ﬁrst

University
Gets Grant

The Richard King Mellon Char-
itable Trust has approved a $120,-
000 grant to the University for
graduate studies in urban renew-
al and city planning.

The grant, to be paid in four
annual installments of $30,000
each, will augment a 1964 grant
to the University. The grant will
create a series of fellowships
known as the Mellon Fellowships
in City Planning and Urban Re-
newal.

The purpose of the grant, to
be allocated for faculty salaries
and fellowships, is two-fold: to
attract more capable graduate
students to the ﬁeld of city plan-
ning and urban renewal and to
increase the teaching resources
of this ﬁeld.

The additional funds will mean
a total of $50,000 per year which
the University will receive from
the Mellon Trust for the years
1965 through 1968.
