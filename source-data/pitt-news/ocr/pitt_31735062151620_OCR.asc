Subscriptions For Showing
Of Five Foreign Films
Available Today

 

 

 

Subscriptions to the ﬁve programs
which comprise the series of French
and German ﬁlms to be shown by the
Fine Arts department, may be pur-
chased at the office of the depart-
ment, Room 109, State Hall, begin-

ning today. The price for the series
is one dollar.

Approximately sixteen ﬁlms will be
shown. Programs have been arranged
for the second Thursday of . each
month, beginning in January, in the
Frick auditorium.

Of prime importance among the
many movies is “The Cabinet of Dr.
Caligari,” most celebrated of foreign
ﬁlms. Produced in Germany in 1919
and directed by Robert Wiene, it has
seldom been shown in this country,
and rarely in its entirety.

The complete version will be
shown at the ﬁrst program of this
series, January 14. It is a surrealist
picturization of the workings of the
mind of an aged inmate of an insti-
tution for the insane. The scenes
are treated in the manner of cubist
paintings, blocks and planes being
used to suggest setting and atmos-
phere.

A preview of “Spring Class,” PTO‘
duced, directed and photographed by
Philip Elliott, assistant professor of
ﬁne arts, also will be shown at the
ﬁrst program. The movie was PTO‘
duced on campus, with a cast of
University students and a certain pro-
fessor whose identity will be revealed
in the next issue of The News.

If you cannot call in person for
tickets, they will be sent upon re-
ceipt of check or money order ad-
dressed to the department ofﬁce.

E. A. Holbrook, dean of the
Schools of Engineering and Mines,
announces the formation of an ad-
visory committee to the Department
of Chemical Engineering.

The formation of the committee

carries on the policy instituted at the
University several years ago, to have
an advisory committee of prominent
men in the engineering professions
and industries, who will be available
for consultation and advice, both as
to laboratory equipment and class-
room studies.

Similar advisory boards have been
appointed for the departments of
metallurgy, mining, petroleum reﬁn-
ing and civil engineering, and others
are being formed at the present time,
Dean Holbrook stated.

The committee consists of Dr. F. W.
Adams, Mellon Institute of Industrial
Research; Dr. Eugene Ayers, chief,
Division of Chemical Research, Gulf
Research Laboratory, Harmarville,
Pa.; Dr. F. C. Frary, director of re-
search, Aluminum Company of Amer-

Seismologist Predicts

‘It Can’t Happen Here’

 

Although more than 300 earth-
quakes disturb Western Pennsylvania
each year, there is 1-ittle possibility of
a major quake in this area, Homer
M. Rutherford, University seismolo-
gist, says.

During the last year, the earth
tremors hitting Western Pennsyl-
vania if placed all together, could
have levelled Pittsburgh and the sur-
rounding cities, Rutherford claims.

On an average of ﬁve times each
week the _delicately tuned seismo-
graphs in the basement of the Cathe-
dral have_ responded to tremors of
varying intensity.

From his ﬁve years’ experience in
charting quakes for the University
station, Rutherford claims that it is
a million-to-one bet that the district
will never be visited by an earth-
quake even remotely comparable to
one as disastrous as the San Fran-
cisco quake.

Much like a pendulum, the seismo-

graph rests with its tip gently touch-
ing the ground. When the ground
begins to quiver, the pendulum be-
cause of its inertia, refuses to quiv-
er. If the ground moves slightly, the
pendulum stays still, but_traces out
the movements of the earth.

Rumblings of the earth are traced
on graph-like sheets. The story of
each quake is told in a jagged set of
lines. ‘ ,

Rutherford explained that earth-
quakes occur from 10 to 100 times
daily in some parts of the world. The
majority are of insufficient intensity
to be felt at  distances.

The University's station is the
only one in an educational institution
in the state, and is one of the few
university-maintained stations in the
country. Rutherford besides having
the distinction of heading one of the

38 seismological stations in the coun- ,,

try, also teaches regular courses in
seismology. Only seven other Amer-
ican schools offer such courses.

Treatment according to need rath-

toward the problem of criminal de-
linquency, according to Curtis A.
Williams, secretary of the Western
Pennsylvania committee on Penal

“We have been attacking the prob-

National Legion Commander
Will Address Banquet
Of Varsity Men

 

Pitt’-s 1936 varsity football team,
ranked as one of t-he nati-on’s best,
will be honored at the annual banquet
of the Varsity Letter Club to be held
Thursday evening, December 3, at
the University Club.

Noteworthy wearers of the “P” will
be present to pay homage to the most
recent batch of Pitt letter winner-s.
Chi-ef among this alumni group is
Harry W. Colm-ery, L16, of Topeka,
Kansas, who as newly elected Nation-
al Commander of the American Le-
«gi-on, will be the principal speaker.

Colmery won his letter second-bas-
ing for the Pitt baseball teams of
1913 and 1914. After graduation, he
moved to Utah. Until the war broke
out he practiced law, at which time
he became a ﬁrst lieutenant in the
Aviation Corps.

Moving to Topeka, Kansas, in
1920, Colmery b-ecame active in build-
ing up the Department of Kansas of
the American Legion. His record
having attracted state-wid-e attention,
he became in succession, Judge Ad-
vocate and State Commander of the
Legion. At the National American
Legion Convention held this past Sep-
tember in Cleveland, he was honored
by being chosen National Commander.

Concert Unit, Men’s Quartet
Also Present Program

 

Three musical organizations at the
University are busy rehearsing for a
concert engagement to be ﬁlled at
the Evans City and Zelienople High
Schools on Thursday, December 10.

Concert and advanced sections of
the ROTC Band and a section of
the orchestra will participate. In
addition one of the quartets from the
Men’s Glee Club, composed of Wil-
liam Cover, C38; Frank Engel, C38;
Warren Gottschalk, C40, and Ralph
Bergeman, EE39, will sing.

In a recent shakeup by the band
leaders, 47 men were assigned to po-
sitions in the concert unit and 39
to the advanced band. A third sec-
tion, the training band, is at present
composed of 69 men. Total instru-
mentation, including musicians and
oﬁicers, amounts to approximately
160 pieces.

Dr. Hooker Will Give
Lecture On Nervous

the regular dimier meeting of Col-
lembolae, honorary science fraternity,
tomorrow evening.

Dinner will be served at 6:30
o’clock in Room 1017, Cathedral, to
those who make reservations in Room
1009, Cathedral, today. The price is
35 cents. The lecture will be given
in Room 1001, Cathedral, at 8 o’clock.
All students interested in biology are
invited to attend this meeting.

uct, or criminal, while we should
have been concerning ourselves with
the childhood of the delinquents.”

“The individual,” he said, “is con-
ditioned from the cradle to whatever
course he takes. Society is responsi-
ble for his action-s. Therefore it
should give him the beneﬁt of the
doubt and seek to remove his social
disadvantages.”

One of the main shortcomings of
the present judicial and penal sys-
tems, he declared, is the lack of
an attempt to ﬁnd the cause for crim-
inal action. “There is too much of a
spirit of vengeance brought into
penal procedure,” he stated. “So-
ciety assumes the responsibility of
vengeance, and denies it to individ-
uals.”

Mr. Williams declared that condi-
tions in Pennsylvania prisons are es-
sentially not much better than Geor-
gia “chain gang” c~on~d.itions. Accord-
ing to him, underground dungeons
are common in Pennsylvania jails,
and there are even s-ome totally in-
sane persons within the walls of state
institutions.

Zeta Tau/llpha
Skit Wins Sing

Theta’s Take Second Place
With Mountaineer Play

By Charlotte Levy

Zeta Tau Alpha reverted to second
childhood in the prize winning skit
presented Monday night at the Pan-
hellenic Interfraternity Sing.

Dressed in short gingham dresses
with big bow ribbons in their hair,
they took the parts of fraternally
min-ded pupils in a kindergarten
class. Kay Hardy, C37, as the stern
teach-er, led the ZTA kindergarten
through their arithmetic, spelling, and
history lessons.

The ZTA’s were followed in close
competition by the Kappa Alpha
Theta’s, who won honorable mention
in a true hill-billy skit. Shot guns,
corn-cob pipes, and ragged clothes all
brought big laughs from the audience.

The criteria for judging the skits
were: originality, 35 per cent; group
spirit, 35 per cent; P015811 0f per-
forinance, 20 per cent, and musical
ability, 10 per cent.

The judges were Miss Thyrsa W.
Amos, dean of women; Carl B. Cass,
assistam; professor of English; Dr. B.
J. ‘Hovde, associate P1‘0f98-S01‘ Of his-
tory; Miss Helen P001 Rush, assistant
dean of women, and Miss Jane
Wells Shumner, instructor in physical
education.

Aided by an unusual and lucky

Dave Mackey, BA40, chairman of

his committee .gave evidence of a
large crowd for the ﬁrst freshman

Many members of the committee
have already sold their quota of tick-

claimed. Freshmen, both men and
women, were supporting the affair in
grand style.

Plans announced several weeks ago

On Friday

 

Aptitude Examination Given

By Dr. Carrol Whitmer
In Memorial Hall

Medical aptitude tests, one of the
bases of admission to the University
School of Medicine, will be given Fri-
day in the Banquet Room of Memo-
rial Hall. Dr. Carrol A. Whitmer, as-
sistant professor of psychology, will
be in charge.

Since the test is given but once a
year, all students who plan to enter
a medical school in September, 1937,
will arrange to take the test. How-
ever, it is not necessary that all pre-
medical requirements be completed
at the time the test is taken if the
requirements will be completed in
time for entrance to medical school
in the fall of 1937.

A fee of one dollar is required to
defray the expenses of the commit-
tee. This fee is payable at the Treas-
urer’s office, Room 7, State Hall, and
the receipt issued by the Treasurer
will entitle the student to admission
to the examinations.

The medical aptitude tests, which
are now one of the normal require-
ments for entrance to a medical
school, will be sent to Washington
for scorin-g._ Results are now used by
nearly all the approved medical
schools in the country as a factor ‘in
the selection of their s-tu-dents.

The test will begin at 3:30 o’clock
on December 4 and will be approxi-
mately one hour an-d 45 minutes in
length. Last year 227 students at
the University and 10,671 students
of 624 colleges throughout the coun-
try took the examination.

Cooperation between fraternities
and university authorities was stressed
at the 28th annual session of the Na-
tional Interfraternity Council, which
convened last week-end in New York.

Ways and means to build character-

and leadership in fraternity circles
through supplementary faculty super-
vision was the subject of a general
discussion in which noted educational
advisors and student representatives
participated at the Friday afternoon
meeting.

Dr. Vincent W. Lanfear, dean of
men, an-d Robert C-orl-ey, assistant
dean of men and advisor to frater-
nities, represented the University at
the conclav-e.

Hugh J. Ryan, ’16, re-presenting
Delta Sigma Phi. and Louis M.
Fushan, ’23, grand superior of Phi
Epsilon Pi, also attended as dele-
gates.

The conference has no legislative
power but is held for the discussion
of questions of mutual interest to
fraternities. Its function is purely ad-
visory. All fraternities at the Univer-
sity were represented at the confer-
ence.

This was the ﬁrst time since the middle of 1930 that the index
has passed the normal mark. Business is as good now as it was
during December, 1929, and the ﬁrst half of 1930. Neverthe-
less, it is still 18 per cent below the cyclical. peak of July, 1929.

tion at Haverford College, will talk
on “Training for Christian Leader-
ship in Public Affairs” before a gen-
eral session at the First Baptist

groups, which will discuss peace, the
cooperative movement, the church,
the state and the individual, and the
opportunity for youth. The seminar
groups will adjourn Saturday after-
noon in time to permit visiting dele-
gates to visit points of interest in
Pittsburgh.

TAP DANCING!

Annual Pitt Riﬂes’ Formal
Planned For Next Week

Another tap dance affair.

This time the tapping will be for
officers of Pitt Riﬂes, honorary mili-
tary science fraternity, and the danc-
ing will be at the Twentieth Century
Club, Friday, December 11.

Pitt Riﬂes’ dance has become an
annual tradition with military formal
dress required, but this year the
price of admission is $1.75 a couple.
The $1.7 5 rate is rather unusual, ex-
plains Chairman Al Kairys, BA39,
but then this dance is rather un-
usual, too.

At any rate, William Kunkel, C39,
is business manager, and tickets may
be purchased from the following
members of the committee:

Robert Luskin, C38; Edward Ellis,
C39; Donald Sipe, E39; James Mar-

Freshman Council
Me e ts Tomorrow

To Discuss Policy

Activities of the class of 1939 for
the year will be discussed at the ﬁrst
Freshman Council meeting of the
term tomorrow at 3:30 o’clock at
Heinz House.

Following the precedent established
last year, the Council will act as the
governing body for freshman women
and will include the chairman of each
unit, the Council representative elect-
ed by each unit, and the unit ad-
visers. The system was instituted
last year because it was felt that
members of the freshman class were
not sufficiently acquainted with each
other to vest great responsibility in
the hands of a few women.

The Council will be under the di-
rection of Mary Jane Beachler, C37,
chairman of the WSGA Organizations
Committee in charge of the freshman
units. At each meeting a freshman
chairman and secretary for the ses-
sions will be elected. One dinner
meeting and one afternoon meeting
of the Council will be held each
month.

Freshman Affair Declared
Cinch By Gay Chiseler
In Mannerly Letter

 

By Annie Oakley’s Brother

A tall, light-complexioned, hand-
some gentleman reports that he is
planning to crash the Freshman
Dance this Friday night.

In a gentlemanly letter written to
Chairman Dave Mackey, BA40. Mr.

Shean O’Reilly, otherwise known as
“Two-Eyed Reilly,” and “Slippery
Geezer,” states that he intends to
squeeze into the William Penn ball-
room without anyone putting a ﬁnger
on him. Mackey and his committee
evidently disagree with Mr. O’Reilly
in that they are putting a special
guard at all entrances.

“The matter is serious to us be-
cause it might endanger our reputa-
tion,” comments Mackey. “In his
letter to me, ‘Two-Eye’ pointed out
that he wished to attend the dance
for two reasons: to hear Tom Gentry
and his Ambassadors; and to make
good on his ﬁrst exploit in gate
crashing in Pittsburgh.”

The freshmen admit that they have
very little to work on. All that is
known about Mr. O’Reilly is his rep-
utation and a few physiological facts.
He is reputedly handsome and has an
income large enough to comfortably
support him. His accent, schooling,
habits, and home life are unknown
factors.

His technique is simple. He writes
letters to leaders of important events
telling them that he is certain that
he will get by their watchers with-
out a ticket. During 10 years he
has attended the Dempsey-Tunney
ﬁght, the Presidential Ball, the World
Series, the Death Cortege of King
George, the 1936 Olympics, and nu-
merous small fry functions that he
declines to comment upon.

This reporter thinks a great deal
of the class of 1940, but in View of
Mr. O’Reilly’s past exploits, he has
a sneaking hunch that that gentle-
man will make good his claim.

Chest Fund Drive
Sets Record

Although short of the goal of $11,-
000, the University Campus Chest
drive had reached an unprecedented
high yesterday when $9,706.35 had
been counted, according to J. G.
Quick, registrar and general chair-
man.

Almost complete returns from fac-
ulty and University employees show
contributions of $6,865.00. Among
the students, $2,412.30 had been
given by the undergraduates so far,
and $418.15 by the professional
schools, to make a total of student
donations of $2,830.45.

“Even though this is a partial re-
port, it is even now one of the ﬁnest
manifestations of social concern that
has ever been recorded at the Uni-
versity,” said Mr. Quick.

Touch Football Champs Retain Title For Second Year
With Groat To Morse Forward Netting Necessary
Touchdown For Victory Over Phi Gams

 

It may be just another cup on the mantel to the Kappa
Sigs but it means that by defeating the Phi Gams, 6-0, in a
little tougher than touch football on Trees gym ﬁeld Monday
afternoon they retained the title of Interfraternity grid champs.

Coming early in the third quarter,’x‘/‘w

the sole tally was the result of a
drive from mid-ﬁeld that opened

when Kappa Sig Moffatt intercepted
a pass from Erickson. The winning

march continued with Moffatt again

snaring a ﬂat pass of Groat’s and
being downed on the Phi Gam 10-
yard stniper. The Groat to Morris-
sey combine was good for another
pass that put the ball on the one-yard
line. Again Groat, as good as back-
ﬁeld men come in this game, tossed
a short pass, this time to Morse, for
the only score of the day. A pass
for the extra point failed.

Some Statistics

Although the Phi Gams led in ﬁrst
downs, 5-3, the Kappa Sigs completed
more passes. Seven times totaled
the number of times the champ re-
ceivers caught the pigskin while the
Phi Gams were successful on four.
The Fijis’ yardage was piled up by
runbacks and three penalties. The
losers also shone in another phase,
that of intercepting passes, for ﬁve
passes intended for Kappa Sig receiv-
ers went astray while but two Phi
Gam passes ended up in the posses-
sion of the champs.

McCutcheon on the Kappa Sig line
deserves a lion’s share of the credit
for his blocking and all around line
play rates tops in any Interfraternity
league. Bill Schen-ck, Fiji quarter-
back, shone as the star of the run-
ners-up while Ray Dimit, playing his
initial game as a halfback, showed
real speed on tw-o interceptions. One
of these interceptions of Kappa Sig
forwards in the last half minute of
play livened the game. The ﬁnal
whistle blew as the Phi Gams were
trying desperately to score on wide
sweeping plays an-d short bullet
passes.

Phi Gams Hold

An offensive drive by Groat and
the Kappa Sigs put the ball down well
within s-coring territory late In the
second quart-er. Snaring a pas-s that
Ericson intended for Sawin, Groat
used some of his knowledge of broken
ﬁeld running to good advantage an-d
eluded Phi Gams until deep in their
territory. A short pass over the line
to Summers took the ball to the Fiji
ﬁve-yard line. Shortly before the
drive was nipped, a pass with the
Kappa Sig star duo, Marty Groat and
Ed McCutcheon ﬁguring, climaxed
the offensive on the Phi Gam three.

A pass from Bill Schenck to Koh-
berger pulled the Fijis out of danger
by terminating (gr the mid-ﬁeld line.

Pitt Fins Will Hold

Extensive Tryouts
For Wate r Spree

 

Pitt Fins send out an SOS to all
women who like to swim.

Beginning tomorrow and continu-
ing for two days next week, exten-
sive tryouts for the Water Carnival
sponsored by Pitt Fins Club of WAA
will be held at Trees pool.

Plans for the carnival, which will
take place in April, will begin as
soon as the judges have picked the
winning manuscript from among those
entered in the contest, which closed
Monday. The winner will be award-
ed a ten-dollar prize at the carnival.

The schedule for tryouts is plan-
ned as follows: Floating formations
from 4:15 to 5 o'clock; diving and
stunts on Monday from 4 to 5, and
swimming formations, Tuesday at
4:30 o’clock.

Any woman student who can swim
and who knows the front and back
crawls and the breast stroke fairly
well, is eligible to try out. Miss
Jane Shurmer, instructor in physical
education, and members of Pitt Fins,
of which Eleanor Fedigan, Ed37, is
president, will oﬁiciate.

 

Students, Faculty

Smarting from two defeats at hands
of the faculty last year, the Univer-
sity Bridge Club will be out for re-
venge tonight in its match with the
faculty in Room 817, Cathedral, at
7:30 o’clock.

This year’s team is composed of
ten veterans and ten newcomers. Se-
der, Sprague, Markey, Callomon, H.
Schein, Schultz, Anderson, Rackoﬂ’,
Krasik, and Sachs are the holdovers
from last year’s team. Blum, Hart,
J. R. Friday, Levine, Goleman, Cap-

Dr. A. L. Robinson, assistant pro-
fessor of chemistry; Harold Dice,
University librarian, and Dr. James
S. Taylor, professor of mathematics,
will lead the faculty team, which will
strive for its third consecutive vic-
tory.

 

Pitt, Canton
Y Natators
Vie Tonight

Just the mention of swimming and
shivers go shivering down your tim-
bers, which means it’s cold outside.
Pitt’s varsity swimming team and the
Canton Ymermen don’t seem to mind,
however, and the Panther swim sea-
son opens with a practice meet with
the Ohioans at 8 o’clock tonight up
in the Tre-es pool waters.

Although the regular schedule for
Pat Corr’s splashers does not officially
open until January 9, the Panthers
have been busily practicing and to-
night’s dual meet begins a series of
practice meets before the season
opener with Slippery Rock.

As announced last week, the Pan-
thers will meet eight opponents, three
of them being new arrivals to Pitt's
schedule. Temple, Western Reserve,
and Ohio Wesleyan are the new ones
while Slippery Rock, Penn State,
Army, Franklin and Marshall, and
Delaware come back to splash with
the Panthers again.

The three teams not on the sched-
ule this season are Manhattan, Ohio
State, and Carnegie Te-ch. Of these
three, Pitt whipped Manhattan and
Te-ch but l-ost to the Buckeyes in
1936. The season’-s record for last
year stood at six wins and three
losses, the other two defeats coming
from Franklin and Marshall, and
Army.

Pitt Rifles Will Hold

Twenty Games Listed
On 1936-37 Cage Card

When it comes to dishing out in
grand style, let the good doctor, H.
Clifford Carlson, do the dishing. In
addition to dishing out ice cream to

his basketball players for as long
back as anyone can remember, Carl-
son has also been dishing out basket-
ball teams that have been the cream
in anybody’s cupful of basketball, if
you take your basketball in cups.

One of the reasons that those bas-
ketball teams are such a good dish is
that they have been well coached. An-
other reason is that they have always
played a schedule that hoops them in
with the nation’s best quintets.

Dr. Carlson has dished out another
savory schedule this year. As an-
nounced just recently, it includes a
string of 20 games. Ten of those
games are affairs with the Pitt oppo-
nents in the Eastern Intercollegiate
Conference, two games with each of
the ﬁve members.

In this set-up is a trip to the Mid-
west, hotbed of the country’s basket-
ball. That excursion comes right in
the beginning of the season.
western will be ﬁrst on the Panther
schedule, being played Friday, De-
cember 11. DePaul and Butler will
also be met on that trip. Another
holiday engagement for the Panthers
is Wisconsin, to be played at the sta-
dium pavilion on December 21.

Conference competition will begin
at the stadium on January 6 when
Pitt meets Temple. Carnegie Tech,
another Conference opponent, follows
on the stadium card on January 9.

Hockey Tourney
Ends Tomorrow

Champions of the women's Intra-
mural hockey tournament will be de-
cided tomorrow when Schen-Body,
leader among the non-major teams,
clashes with the winning major team
in the ﬁnal game of the hockey season
this year. The game is scheduled to
begin at 4 o’clock.

Schen-Body, captained by Feemy
Shakarian, C39, was declared winner
of the games between the non-major
teams after a hard-fought battle last
week with the Wildcats, managed by
Dot Holbrook, Ed37. Betty Cox,
E37, is captain of the victorious ma-
J0!‘ team which will compete for
championship honors tomorrow.

Final game of this brief home stand
will be played against mighty Notre
Dame on January 13.

Pitt travels to Annapolis for a
game with the Sailors on the night of
January 16. Still in the Pullmans,
the Panthers will pull into Washing-
ton January 18 for a meeting with
Georgetown.

The schedule from then on will be
as follows:

January 23, Penn State, here: Jan-
nary 30, West Virginia, here; Febru-
ary 3, Westminster, here; February
10, Duqu-esne, here; February 16,

North- '

Panthers Receive

Lambert Grid Trophy

The powerful Panther football
team received two more distinctions
yesterday morning when they were
notiﬁed that they were awarded the
Lambert trophy, symbolic of the East-
ern championship, and placed third
ranking college team among the na-
tion’s best in a poll by Associated
Press football experts.

The Lambert trophy was given to
the Panthers over such strong teams
as Penn, Yale, Dartmouth, Navy, and
Princeton. It is selected by a group
of New York sports writers with the
Panthers being the ﬁrst team to ever
receive the cup.

In national ratings the Panthers, as
a result of the loss an-d tie marring
their record, bow to Minnesota and
Louisiana State, No. 1 and No. 2 in
the nation. The ﬁnal standings in the
Associated Press poll lists Minnesota,
L. S. U., Pitt, Alabama, Washington,
Santa Clara, Northwestern, Notre
Dame, Nebraska, and Penn in the
ﬁrst ten.

This Football Business

HE STADIUM OFFICE on the De Sota Street

slope has weathered quite a storm during its ﬁrst
season in the revamped Y-hut. Athletic moguls and
young ladies on the staff hardly were settled com-
fortably in their swivel chairs until football crashed
through for a “ﬁrst and ten” that rocked everything
but the Duquesne Hilltop and a few gents along Ford-
ham Way. But we are ahead of our story.

On The Record . . .

Everyone knew Ohio Wesleyan would be side-
tracked early that ﬁrst Saturday afternoon. Then at
Columbus, Pitt hit the top, too early, against Ohio
State—for next Saturday the boys felt quite sure that
the Dukes held the only hand that might outdraw the
Panther royal flush, a “natural” at that. Clipper Smith
turned up with a wild card in George Matsik to give
the Dukes ﬁve of a “kind” and the only 1936 decision
over the Pitt machine.

Then came the smashing of an Irish jinx, followed
by another on-e of those horn-locking Ram balks. Ne-
braska, beaten only by Minnesota, was so “sure” that
it must be “Husker” day against Pitt, that Dr. Suther-
land decided that this was just the time to remind
them that cars of waving yellow corn are not the only
things that get “shocked” in early November. After
Nebraska, Tech, probably the best “beaten” team in
the country, took a terriﬁc lacing that convinced Pitts-
burgh fans, at least (and they’re usually pretty hard to
convince) that this was one of the greatest teams in
history. And, oh yes, West Virginia and Penn State
fell hard.

Polls that provide little more than weak substan-
tiation for the most ridiculous sort of arguments, place
the Pitt entry close to Minnesota. That may prove
nothing more than the fact that most people are agreed
that Pitt football is just about as top-notch as it comes.

However, it is a ﬁne tribute to Dr. Sutherland, Pitt
athletic officials, and, more important, to the boys on
the squads. Pitt has always ranked high and will
continue to rank high so long as they continue at
the present pace.

Off The Record . . .

P ITT HAS ALWAYS played clean, hard football.

Dr. Sutherland believes in precision, accuracy, and
fundamentals. He teaches his boys to play the game
on the ﬁeld according to the rules. But it does not
stop there. He develops men.

We all know at least one or two of his boys well.
They have ﬁne ideals, and are at ease socially because
of extensive travel and contacts. They are willing to
serve, cheerful in defeat, and usually possess much
more drive than most of us. When people “outside”
the University applaud their efforts, we too feel proud
in believing that we had something to do with it.

More than a regular share of accusations have been
made this year. But those on the top must expect a
continual pecking away at the very foundation of their
successes. Pitt success, on the football ﬁeld, as in
many other departments, has been built upon a ﬁrm
foundation, one that should remain as long as the
present high standard of competitive sport remains.

Husking The Husker . . .

WHEN ONE OF OUR competing college editors
makes wild and inaccurate accusations concerning
thine sportsmanship and tactics of a Pitt team, then
the accusations hit us all. Ignoring such a thing as
this is undoubtedly the best way to handle the situation
But when the press screams those accusations in bold.
black type, the situation is not so easy to ignore.

Then there was that equally ridiculous “steal” story
of the wide1y—p1.1blicized “Biggie” Goldberg that was
so vigorously denied by South Bend authorities, 1'6-
puted originators of the tale. °

Add to this that Hen-sley-O’Rielly affair late in the
Irish-Pitt game that brought Coach Layden of the
Ramblers right into the thick of things, on the ﬁeld and
throughout -the country’s newspapers. Layden later
admitted his mistake in the rule interpretation. The
referee carried out his detection of unnecessary rough-
ness on the part of the N otre Dame safety man, and the
Irish were penalized half the distance to their goal line.

There have also been investigations with most of the
emphasis being placed on the sale at the newsstand
rather than any constructive suggestion or interpreta-
tion of the existing conditions.

Considering it all in retrospect, Pitt gridmen are
still ﬁrmly entrenched in not only the front lines on
the football front, but in the various other lines that
stamp them as men in the highest sense. This 1936
squad has been truly great.

The Grindstone

The main objection to ROTC training in colleges is
that the theory behind it consists almost entirely of the
doctrine that we must be prepared. In spite of what
any ROTC man says to the contrary—that he learns
only military history or tactics so that he may “be
ready”—ask any one of them after graduation, and
he’ll proclaim to the high heavens that the United States
must be prepared. And by being prepared,_ he means
increasing the size of the army an navy,.1n spite of
the fact that it is already the largest peace-time military
establishment in our history. _

Let us see what some experts in the ﬁeld have said
about preparedness and war in general :_ .

“I went into the British army believing that if you
want peace you must prepare for war. I believe now
that if you prepare thoroughly _for war_you will get
war”—-Major-General Sir Frederick Maurice.

“We won some things from the war which were not
on the program. For example, we had a complete dem-
onstration of the fallacy of the old tradition that pre-
paredness prevents war. That is worth something”—
George Dern, late Secretary of War.

“If my soldiers would think for themselves, not
one would remain in the ranks”—Frederick the Great
of Prussia.

“Nothing has ever been decided by war that could
not be decided without it; and if decided after the war,
why not before?”—General U. S. Grant. _

“It is the business of the churches to make my busi-
ness impossible”—Field Marshal Lord Haig.

“Lord Kitchener told me he had fought with the
French in the Franco-Prussian war and had spent most
of his life in soldiering, but that he had never seen a
war out of which any permanent peace had come; and
that while ﬁghting brought out great individual heroism,
it was futile in settling great international disput.es"--
Lady Oxford, “More Memories.”

“I doubt if war ever settled anything. It unsettles
everything”-—_Napoleon I.

“I have given four years of my life to leading the
youth of Virginia to battle and to death. I want to
give the remaining years of my life to teaching the youth
of Virginia how to live”——Gen. Robert E. Lee.

“And so I say: To hell with war”—-Gen. Smedley
Butler.

Heigb-Ho

byieo...

T DOESN’T SEEM to me that it is fair enough, and I
daren’t say much because I never was very effectual
in capital letters. Let those who wish produce the
sound and fury; I ﬁnd the interlude between the clashes
of the cymbals or the sudden quiet between the ﬁrst
onslaught and the rushing fury of the gale much more
interesting. It is in that brief instant that light-tired
eyes or noise-dinned ears may relax, enjoy the momen-
tary stillness, stiﬂe a yawn, and murmur a calming
“Heigh Ho !”

About Norbert Troutman

HERE’S AN OLD, old story still going the rounds
about an old, old man, one Norbert Troutman, from
the desert of Transmania. The story, of course, just
goes the round at moments when a certain philosophic
soul, jaded by constant bombardment of an unsympa-
thetic world, plus the bitter—sweet of two mugs of ale
in a cozy back room, liberates it to an open-eared,
pretzel—munching intellect who pays for the suds.

After a preliminary dissertation on how people just
don’t understand the Communists, Communists don’t
understand the capitalists, capitalists just don’t under-
stand labor, Green can’t understand Lewis, and Lewis
just can’t understand—all with a philosophic tear or
two while peering into the depleted mugs——the sage
begins his story:

“Norbert Troutman was a simple and honest soul
who went out to the middle of the Transmanian desert
to prospect for gold. After several long, lean years
of looking under rocks and digging holes in the ground
and not ﬁnding much more than a few grams of silver
with which to buy the local Hearst Sunday paper with
the Transmanian Weekly Magazine insert, Norbert was
pretty much discouraged.

“He decided to give up prospecting for a while. He’d
go to the city, write a book about Starlight over Trans-
mania, and maybe give some lectures before some
women’s literary societies. Besides, Tessiemay lived in
the city, and Norbert thought he had a date to marry

Tessiemay.
* * 5|! *

And Then He Struck Gold

“F IRST OF ALL, he decided to bury his prospecting

outﬁt and skillet so he could ﬁnd _it if he ever
wanted to come back and take up looking for gold
again. Luck would have it, though, that just where he
dug the hole a vein of gold struck his shovel, and Nor-
bert decided to wait a while before he visited the city,
Tessiemay, and the golddiggers whose pictures he had
cut from the Transmanian Weekly and papered all over
his shack. He’d wait a month.

“Norbert waited a month. He did a good deal of
mining, but at the end of that time he discovered that
there was more gold left in the vein than he had taken
out of it. He’d dig another month before he’d go to
the city. Another month went by, and when he hadn’t
drained the Whole vein into his sacks, he decided to wait
a while longer.

“Years later Norbert was still digging away at his
gold. In the meantime, however, the Transmanian
desert began to change. The Transmanian government
built a big dam across the _Transmanian river, and what
had formerly been a trickle was now a cascade. A city
began to grow at Norbert’s doorstep.

III alt * *

Wherein More Suds Disappear

“IN THE CITY there were theaters, libraries, schools,

music halls, and all sorts of things Norbert once
thought his" gold would bring him. Tessiemay had also
migrated to the new city. But Norbert never noticed
the city, and he only thought of how Tessiemay’s hair
was like the gold he was digging when he thought
of her at all.

“The city wanted to buy his claim to build a scientiﬁc
institute, but Norbert ordered them away. Soon they
had pickets walking around the place with signs ‘Unfair
to Culture’ and ‘Down with Norbert’ written on them,
but Norbert didn’t see them. He was always looking
down at his vein of gold.”

The philosopher takes a long draught of the ale which
his friend had set up, draws the sleeve of his coat across
his lips, looks sadly at the shrinking foam, and con-
tinues:

“Then one day Norbert dies. All his life he worked
for something that was at his doorstep, and he was too
blind to see. He was worried too much about the
means than about the result.” More tears mix with the
phi1osopher’s suds as his friend takes him by the arm

and leads him to fresh air.

He Talked To Himself

By Milton Lehman
SYMPHONY OF SILENCE

Wayland F. Vaughan in his “General Psychology”
remarks, “Carlyle and Emerson are said to have passed
many an evening together in silence, smoking their
pipes, and enjoying themselves thoroughly. Friendship
and fellowship answer a profound need of human
nature.”

Carlyle and Emerson Were, of course, highly-tuned
artists. They shared genius or near—genius. Perhaps
that is the reason they could be contented in silence.
There was something within them to serve for nour-
ishment.

Today we call these people dreamers, these people
who can think without talking, who can question
without acting. But it simply isn't a part of our
makeup.

To sit quietly in a dark room, smoking a pipe or
cigarette, perhaps, and think: that is one of the most
valuable experiences we can offer ourselves. There

is something within all of us, if we take time out to
discover it.

TANGENTS AND DETOURS

John came home for the Thanksgiving recess, and
we got talking. “How’s school? Are you coming along
all right?”

“Oh, it’s all right,” he began. “But I can't help
from becoming dissatisﬁed. I guess I'm accomplishing
about as much as the average person, but something’s
wrong.

“Night work and lectures are ﬁne, I SIIPPOSG. and
I’m getting my work done. But something’s missing.
More and more every day I feel that my life is a blank.
No purpose, no reason for doing the things I do, and
no time for doing the things I really want to do.

“At times I want to be purposive, to actually line
up my aims and deﬁnitely try to accomplish them. But
there are too many detours. Dances, house Parties-all
that sort of thing is good, they say. Broadening. Now
I am broadening out so much that I am unable 130 Pin
myself down to anything. I feel that there’s much to
be done, but I ﬁnd so little time to do it.

“And then comes another string of dances. and I tell
myself I have only 9. few more years of $611001. that I
might as well have a good time while I'm therei, and
that there’s really no sense worrying already; Then
I’m oﬁ on another tangent.

“I'm afraid that unless I buckle down to Ssbfnething
real, something signiﬁcant, I'll be ﬂying of at tangents
until they tuck me into my 6 by 3 foot plot. Morbid,
isn't it?”

“I rather agree with you, John.”

"Transition House’

Steel, Other Materials Used
In Institute Undertaking

 

A “transition house,” built partly
of steel and partly of the ol-der and
more conventional building materials,
will soon be ﬁnished at Mellon Insti-
tute.

Institute officials call the struc-
ture a “research house.” The ﬂoors
are of “cellular” steel, the same type
of steel that has been used for some
time in cocmmencial buildings and
bridges. Advantages cited by scien-
tists are that the “cellular” steel
ﬂoors save construction time and
wall weight, provide a ceiling, and
are ﬁreproof and termite-proof.

Bond-ed metal, developed in the
Mellon Institute, is used to produce
unusual effects on some of the in-
terior walls. The material is a steel
sheet to which felt is bonde-d by
means of a softer metal, so that the
surface may be ﬁnished as desired.

Walls of the study and downstairs
hall are ﬁni-shed with a wood veneer.
Plastic ﬁnishes are used in the lava-
tory downstairs and in the upstairs
bathroom. Hubbelite, latest product
of research at the Institute, will be
used for window sills, porch and bath-
room ﬂoors, and wall ﬁnish in one
bathroom.

Hubbelite, invented by D. S. Hub-
bell, of the Institute, is a cement
which hardens into a synthetic stone.
A copper-covered, protected metal
will be used on the roof.

R. L. Smith, ’88, Recalls
College Days At WUP

 

Alumnus Tells Of Classes,
Sporadic Baseball Nine
Of 50 Years Ago

(Ed. Note: This is the second
in a series of articles concerning
the history of the University. Next
semester the sesquicentennial anni-
versary will be officially observed
by a ﬁtting celebration, plans for
which are already under way. »

By Milton G. Lehman, Jr.

Forty-eight years ago R. L. Smith
was graduated from the Western Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania.

Last week Mr. Smith returned to
the University to recount his story,
almost a half century old, to Mrs.
Agnes L. Starrett, assistant professor
of English, who is preparing the his-
tory of the University for the sesqui-
centennial anniversary, next year.

“Classes were quite small,” Mr.
Smith claimed. “Recitations were hel-d
in small rented rooms in a seminary
building on the North Side. You see
this was before the Western Univer-
sity moved to the new buildings on
Perrysville Avenue.”

Graduating with a CE degree from
a senior class of six in the School of
Engineering, Mr. Smith discussed the
subject “Mining Engineering” in his
term thesis. The thesis anticipated
the formation of the combined School
of Mining-Engineering seven years
later.

As a member of the Irving Literary

' Society, forerunner to Quill Club, Mr.

Smith delivered a prize oration on the
subject “Will There Ever Be An Ani-
mal Superior To Man?” “I thought
there would be at the time,” the or-
ator claimed last week. “I remem-
ber I even had a book to prove it.”
Sports at WUP, he recalled, were
rather limited. “I won't forget our
sporadic baseball nine, however,” he
said. “We played one game with
Beaver Falls, to which all students
who were not members of the team
took horns. Probably to cheer the
boys to victory. At any rate, the
team did so poorly we broke the
horns and went home disgusted.”
Mr. Smith remembered several
members of the faculty and admin-
istration from his years at college.
He particularly recalled Professor

Reid T. Stewart, Who, after 48 years
teaching engineering, is now spend-
ing his winter in Florida; “Uncle
Dan” Carhart, dean of the School of
Engineering; Professor Rohrbacher,
instructor in German and history,
and Chancellor Milton B. Goff, who
was head of the University at the
time.

“I was a farm_boy when I entered
WUP,” Mr. Smith claimed. “I had
been trained on the end of a pitch-
fork. College was a new experience
for me and brought a decided change
of atmosphere. Really, it was one of
the happiest parts of my life.”
