Ervin Committee Resumes;

Hunt Takes Stand Today

WASHINGTON -- Sen. Sam J.
Ervin Jr. will bang his gavel
against the mahogany table in the
huge Senate Caucus Room today.

‘_ resuming the Watergate hearings

that have been recessed since Aug.
7.

The committee has promised
that the rest of the hearings will be
streamlined as compared with the
first 37 days.

They‘ll run only three days a
week instead of ﬁve. The witness
list has been culled to wean out
minor testimony. And there is a
self—iinposed deadline for winding
it up -- November 1.

Live television cameras will be
on hand at least Monday. Tuesday
and Wednesday. with each of the
three commercial networks taking
one day. What they'll do after this
week hasn't been announced.

Watergate conspirator E.
Howard Hunt will be the witness
today. His testimony is expected to
complete phase one: the review of
events leading up to the Demo-
cratic headquarters break-in, the
burglary itself, and the subsequent
coverup.

Then the committee will swing
into the so-called “dirty tricks" in
the 1972 presidential campaign and
tinally the financing of campaigns.

The committee's request for the
tape recordings of Watergate-
related conversations in the White
House still is pending in the courts.

Legal moves for those tapes and
others, made by special prosecutor
Archibald Cox, are further along.
The U.S. Court of Appeals is
deliberating whether to uphold an
order by Chief U.S. Dist. Judge
John J. Sirica that he be allowed to
preview the tapes and decide what
shall go to the Watergateigrand
jury.

Hunt. a 21-year employe of the
Central Intelligence Agency until
his resignation in 1970. pleaded
guilty to conspiracy. burglary and
wiretapping in
break-in. He has since asked Sirica
to allow him to withdraw the plea.

The 55-year old Hunt has
admitted to being a crew boss of
those who broke into the office of
Dr. Daniel Ellsberg's psychiatrist.
although he was not one of the four
men who were indicted by a Los
Angeles county grand jury in the
case.

Hunt will testify before the
Senate committee under immunity
from prosecution for anything he
might say. '

Nurses at the Western Psychia-
tric Institute and Clinic (WPIC).
part of the University Medical
Center. are trying to employ the
Pennsylvania Nurses Association
(PNA) as their bargaining agent in
labor relations with the University.

According to one of the nurses,
the group first asked for recogni-
tion by PNA as their bargaining
representative in January, 1972.
At that time the administration
contested that they were not a
“proper unit” for PNA representa-
tion.

A court Hearing in July. 1973
ruled in favor ofthe nurses. but the
University contested the decision
once again.

Since then. the nurses have been
in constant court action with the
University. to gain representation
from PNA.

For the past week, the nurses
group has been conducting an
informational picket at WPIC to
make the public more aware of the
situation.

Judy Sable. leader of the group.

explained. “There are no nurses in
the Medical Center who have a
bargaining agent for their labor
problems. and this is the first
attempt at representation."
‘~ She added “The issues at hand
are such things as obtaining the
opportunity to determine policy
decision-making that concern us.
as a group of nurses."

Presently the nurses and the
University are awaiting a decision
from the State Labor Relations
Board in Harrisburg as to whether
or not the nurses’ request will be
carried out.

Sable stated “Most all of the
nurses at WPIC are in favor of
gaining PNA representation. and
our support is growing. Until that
demand for representation is met.
we will go through all of the
necessary channels for gaining the
representation that we want-."

into a single program of Freshman
Studies.

“I'd like to introduce some
coherence into the three distinct
programs since each one is a good
way for any incoming student to
begin his college career." McCorry
said. “The freshman year should
be less of a weeding-out process
and more of a time for adjust-
ment."

When asked to comment on how
the current financial squeeze will
affect his duties, McCorry said,
“lt’s tough to sell new programs to
administrations and government
agencies, but neither are these

offices cutting into existing pro- '

grams. They are holding the line

on increased expenditurers.

State—related

Schools

Forced to Borrow Funds

PHILADELPHIA AP - An appro-
priations impasse in Harrisburg
will force Temple University and
three other schools to borrow funds
at the prevailing record-high 10 per
cent interest rate.

Temple will have to borrow
between $4 million and $5 million a
month. until it receives state
funding for the current fiscal year.
tinancial vice president James
Logan said.

Logan said if the loan runs until
Dec. 31. it will cost the school about
$600,000 in interest payments.

A similar fate awaits Pennsylvan-
ia's three other state-related
institutions: the University of
Pittsburgh. Lincoln University in
Chester County and Pennsylvania
State University.

The appropriations bill for the
four universities has already
passed the Housegbut will not be
considered by the Senate until it
reconvenes on Oct. 1.

The House version calls for a 5"

per cent increase over last year.
despite a freeze on state university
spending proposed by Gov. Shapp.
The bill reported out of the Senate
Propriations Committee calls for
an increase of more than 6 per cent.

Under the provisions of the bill on
the Senate floor. Temple would
receive $52.9 million for the
I973-74 fiscal year. This is an
increase of $3.2 million over last
year.

Because it has been operating

Logan said this is standard.
however.

“We're in a perpetual borrowing
situation because we have no
surplus cash." he said. “We
borrow to meet expenses. then get
reimbursed by the state in
quarterly payments."

The first quarter payment would
have arrived at the end of
September. Its absence means
Temple will have no money to pay
the $13.5 million in debts it has
incurred since the startof the fiscal
year.

This is the third straight year
state—related universities have
gone‘ into the fiscal year without
funds. Penn State had to spend 1
million in interest payments during
the 1971-72 ﬁscal year. The school
spent $474,000 during the 1972-73
year.

One provision of the new
appropriations bill will do away
with some of the borrowing built
into the current funding system.
Under the provision. the univer-
sities will be reimbursed in
monthly rather than quarterly
installments. ‘ I

Logan estimates this systeni could
have this school over $500,000 a
year in interest payments.

law enforcement agencies. as well
as the Campus Police.

In previous years, the Legal
Awareness Committee and Cam-
pus Police ﬁled cards containing
the serial numbers of students’
valuables. This enabled the
Campus Police to positively identi-
fy stolen items.

The new project. Operation ID, is
similar to the previous one but also
involves police on the city and
county level. It is tentatively
scheduled for the end of October.

According to Tim Ging of
Student Government, the re-
gistering of valuables has a twofold
purpose. It acts as a deterrent to
theft and if an object is taken, it will
be more readily identiﬁable to
police.

The Legal Awareness Committee
will also sponsor a bike registration
program in conjunction with the
American Automobile Association
(AAA) October 15 and 16. They
will register bikes with the Campus
Police office by engraving the
student number or other identifica-
tion on the bike.

It is hoped this system will act as
a preventive measure to theft and
vandalism of personal property in
University dormitories. -

With the University Health Center bargaining for a new student
insurance this year, the Pitt News examined the present policy and
prices in comparison to a survey of private physicians.

Many of the diagnostic, pathological, and chemical tests given by the
Health Center are identical in price to those of private physicians,
because both use the Associated ‘Pathologists Laboratory, Inc. for
testing. These identical prices then will not be listed. In the second

University Health Center nurses provide free medical adive. photo by

During an interview with Dr. Joanne Robinson, director of the
Health-Center, some additional facts about the University’s Center
emerged. . 0

Dr. Robinson said, “The Health Center started out as simply a nurse
to take care of minor student injuries, but as time went on, we added a
staff of doctors and provided a variety of services. As the cost became
higher and higher. the University decided they could no longer afford
to totally support the Health Center, and so you notice the large
increase in prices.”

‘ Two years ago when the Health Center started charging for its
services, they negotiated the present policy with Blue Cross/Blue
Shield. The contract expires this year.

This policy was the first of its kind, a self-designed policy, and
covered only the services that the University designated. For example,
the policy did not cover the cost of IUD’s or of Group Therapy.

Although 17,000 students were seen by doctors in the Health Center
from September to June, only 1300 students have applied for the
$56.16 insurance policy.

The policy covers all, work done in the Health Center, as well as 80%
of the bill of services by outside doctors. “Many students seem to
unaware of this policy,” said Dr. Robinson. September 24 was the last
day to apply for that insurance.

Dr. Robinson also said that any service given to the students by a
nurse was free. I

Undergraduate
Women Propose
Year's Activities

BY LINDA SAVAGE

The Undergraduate Women’s
Union outlined proposed projects
for the year at their Wednesday
meeting.

A request was made for
volunteers to represent the UWU
on such Pitt committees as Student
Affairs Advisory Council, Provost
Advisory Council, Undergraduate
Counseling Committee, and the
Women's Center committee.

The organization is presently
leaderless and veteran members
say they would prefer that the
organization have a minimum of
leadership. _ Accordingly, plans
were made to elect 2 co-chair-
persons and a business manager at
their next meeting September 27.

Representatives from the W0-
men Studies Program explained at
the meeting the options of
self-designing or acquiring a
certiﬁcate in Women Studies.‘
However, they cautioned that these
majors are better suited for women
with “non-traditional career
goals.”

They also invited UWU members
to help publish a newsletter
including information concerning
all the campus women’s organiza-
tions.

UWU has also been involved
with planning a two day women's
organizations festival starting next
Tuesday. The festival will include
ﬁlms, discussions, seminars. and
workshops involving women-
related topics.

f C  ,A meeting is being held today between members of the student body
A and University administrators to determine the future of the $5

The proposed fee is an ineffective policy which attempts to act as a

A  deterrent to add-drop but fails to provide a solution to the problems
/ which result in add-drop.
‘Add-drop has evolved as the student's way compensating for
inefficiencies in the fegistration process. These inefficiencies include:

V assignments, course changes, and poor and/or inaccurate advising.
A According to Registrar Frank Reed: “We're doing this to stop the
is students who abuse the system." The system is in fact self-abusive.
The inadequacies of the registration process force students _to
legitimately add-drop;

The multitude of shortcomings in the system often results in what
Reed terms “abuse” of the system, but what is actually a_ necessity for
academic survival.

pp The $5 add-drop fee is an answer to the University's headache,
I I s however, it provides no solution to the students’ dilemma.

, The total system needs to be revised. The University must meet the
its needs of the students because this is its reason for being. It cannot
 continue to close its eyes to the multitude of shortcomings in systems
« ,which it has created andxto penalize students for compensating and

Faculty Rights vs.
Administrative Mandates

The question of faculty rights vs. administrative mandates has been
and continues to be a source of controversy in most academic
A. communities. in ,
In response to this conflict faculties in major universities have begun
A to develop plans for unionization, collective bargaining,and tenure
negotiations; it is not uncommon for departments to draw-up individual
constitutions. As the conflict rages, therelemerges a clear pattern of
i  self-governance within the structure of the University.
A This trend toward self-goverance is vital for departmental strength
and the academic growth which will be the logical product of that
strength. i
, Whereas an administration must. play an important role in
. ?_  ‘developing general policies, decision-making concerning specific
I in departmental needs should rest in the hands of the faculty members of
A. the department in question. ~

Individual departments are logically more sensitive to the
educational goals and functioning of their department than any central
administration can ever hope to be. _‘

The recent controversy over the chairmanship of the Black Studies
department is a case study in faculty rights vs. administrative
mandates. It is also a classic example of the ineffectiveness of

I  administrative mandates imposed contrary to‘ strong faculty
sentiments.

When Jack Daniels left his post of department chairman-last spring.
he recommended that Curtiss Porter be named his successor. Porter
had the support of the faculty, by 11-4 vote, the Pittsburgh NAACP,

 A ‘the Organization of Black Administrators, Faculty and Staff (OBAFS),
‘ C ’ and the Black Action Society. '
 Inaddition, Porter was founder of the Black Studies Department,
‘and is ﬁnely attuned to its workings and needs. I p , _‘
g  L , Contrary to expressed desires of the faculty, Dean Jerome
 i  ’ Rosenberg appointed Dr. Fela Sowande as acting department
I chairman. «
, jThe rational behind that appointment according to Rosenberg was
if I two-fold; 1--Sowande would be more ‘sensitive to administrative
policies, and 2--his appointment would end an alleged polarization
within the department. ' I
The necessity for a department to be represented by an individual
 "I'.~.; ‘ . in whose primary orientation and sensitivity lies with his department and
in not. the Administration is clear.

Rosenberg’s anxiety over what he saw as a polarization of the
department was legitimate. He was wrong, however, in assuming that
an externally imposed solution could remedy the situation- Clearly, the
only way to bring the department together would be through an

_ internal, democratic consensus as to its future direction.
 The issue has come full circle. Sowande resigned his post as acting
chairman because of pressure within the department and Rosenberg is
‘again on the verge of appointing a chairman. .
A new list of candidates has been submitted once again to the_Dean’s
_ office listing various people whom the faculty see as capable of running
the department. .
I At this point, a major source of confusion is the Administration’s
appalling lack of consistency regarding chairmanship appointments.
Referring to the appointment of department heads, Rosenberg was
pg recently quoted as saying: “Every department is different, and what
i A applies to the history department doesn’-~t necessarily apply to my
decisions concerning the Black Studies department.”

I have been worrying about the _Supreme Court
lately, even though I know that the members of the
Court are old-enough to take care of themselves.’ and
us. Mostly I worry about theirgfairly recent decision
that the First Amendment, so far as it affects

pornographic literature, ﬁlms, photographs and
, other depictions of activity thought to be outside the

scope of ordinary life, shall be applied strictly on the
basis of local standards.

It is absurd. We have a Constitution, along with its
Amendments, for the simple reason that local option
can not be trusted in certain areas. Until an
Amendment to the Federal Constitution made it
illegal, the laws enacted by almost half the States
cheerfully accepted that one human being can be the
property of another. Other States denied the right to
vote to Blacks, women, Catholics, non-land-owners,
and anyone else they happened to dislike.

V Constitutional action was taken in order to prevent

such abuses on a national basis.

The original Constitution regularized life to some
extent through the application of uniform laws and
practices for the whole country. The first ten
Amendments were added in short order, to
guarantee that the liberties which were the goal of
the Revolution would not be subject to tampering by
small-minded men in individual Staft_gs,,%  _

The first Amendment is my favoritiefiift covers the
mostvground, and seems to have been the target of a
greater variety of attacks than any other. I will quote
it in a minute, but first I would like to quote Hugo
Black. the late Justice of the Supreme Court. Mr.
Justice Black said, many years ago, “...strong
arguments are made, which almost convince me, that

it is very foolish of me to think ‘no law’ means no law.

But what it says is “Congress shall make no
law...abridging the freedom of speech or of the
press.” It says Congress shall make no law doing
that. What it means-—according to a current
philosophy I do not share-—is that Congress shall be
able to make just such a law unless we judges object
too strongly."

The good Justice would be startled and saddened if
he had survived to see this year’s crop on“ the bench
he once occupied. The new judges do not object too
strongly, or indeed, at all.‘ Congress need no longer
make laws abridging the freedom of speech or of the
press; any gang of lawmaking Killikaks can go right
ahead, with the one who can read censoring ‘books,
and the whole august body trooping off to films they
may judge worthy of exclusion.

To save you thetrouble of looking it up, I will copy
the First Amendment here, in its original form. You
may detect parts which have grown a bit worn, or
even inoperative; over the years.

“Amendment I

“Congress shall make no laws respecting an
establishment or religion, or prohibiting the free
exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech;
or of the press; or the right of the people peacably to
assemble, and to petition the Government for a

I’ redress of grievances.”

That is it. It may be the high point in the invention
of America, or at least of the ideal that America once
represented.

‘There has been some erosion. The right peacably
to assemble has been found not to include such
activities as stopping to say a prayer in the White
House. It also does not extend to such activities as
carrying ‘a sign expressing sentiments the President
does not agree with. *

Freedom of the press does not necessarily include
the privelege of staying out of jail while exeercisingj

the right. Freedom of speech extends to, but does‘

not include, private conversations, whether in person
or by telephone. * w I7

So far no religion has been established. However,
the free exercise of those which do exist has certain
limits. In general, the exercise is free so long as it‘
does not conflict with any of the functions
Government claims for itself," as in the area of health,
education, and safety. ,

The document has not changed. The 'First
Amendment still reads the way it originally did. Only
the meaning has been altered.

. This is all history, and probably well-enough
known not to need repetition here, but enough time
has passed since the Supreme Court madethe First
Amendment a matter of local optionithat some effects
can be detected. Some of the effects were painfully
predictable. Law enforcement people from all over
hailed the ruling as a great and useful tool in their
crusades to make life safe and bland for all of us,
whatever we though we might have preferred. The

There are a number of magazines currently
available which characterize themselves as “enter-
tainment for Men”. They are generally monthly
publications, printed on glossy paper and costing
about one dollar. Typically, such a magazine prints
several short stories in each issue, and perhaps a
serialization of a novel, aiong with a number of
articles dealing with such subjects as food, sex, cars,
wine, sex, travel, sex, music, personalities, and sex.
Generally there will be a dozen or so pages of
photographs of naked or nearly-naked women.

Over the years, these photographs have performed

acurious function. Until the l960’s, for instance, it V

was generallyknown that the adult human female
breast was adorned with a nipple. Still later, the
magazines coyly set about revealing the fact that, in
human females beyond the age of puberty, hair is

.found elsewhere than on the head.»

Just in the past couple of years, more progress was
made even though the best revelations had already
been made. The trend was toward more explicitness
at any cost, and it was sometimes difficult to find a
cranny that had not already been explored.

Indeed, one magazine could have easily retitled
itself The Journal of Clinical Photography.

I*am~ neutral as to whether this was good. One
frequent complaint was that the publishers had only
extended the First Amendment to include naked
women. Others complained that the mysteries of life
were taking a beating. Would-be censors, who are
now triumphant, were obliged to fume in impotent
anger.

‘Now it is changed. It took several months, because

W magazines are not thrown together on the spur of the

moment, however much some of them look it. There
is a retreat in progress; the trend towardever-greater
explicitness has probably peaked.

I do not suggest that the loss of photographs which

The implications scare me. Sex is out this week,
and maybe politics next. And then what? Legislation

Thre are enough forces at work already, trying to
make our lives bland and uniform, without

Was Sweet Ole Bill Currie an Accident?

BY DAVE MAJERNIK
Some_t_-imes it is easier to talk
with those who are famous than
with those who are not. “Could I
speak with Bill Currie, please," i
asked, calling to arrange an
interview with the sportscaster of
KDKA television and radio.
“That's me. What can I do for
you,” he answered in a quick,
no-nonsense manner. He agreed to
be interviewed. We arranged for
the day and time. Then I asked the
room number of his office. “Shit,”
he sneered, “we're lucky we have a
place to’ sit around here. Just ask
the receptionist for me."
“This is for a human interest

Collegiate athletes are just kids and
don't know anything anyway, and
the pros aren’t much older.
“People go to sports to be
entertained. I don’t see why the

» entertainment has to eliminated in

sports reporting.”

In person, the 50-year-old native
of High Point, N.C. talks just as he
does on the air, with a southern
drawl, liberally punctuating his
sentences with profanities. With-
out a microphone, however, his
voice is much softer, betraying a
carefully-concealed shyness.

newspaper reporter, working in

Appraising his two and a half
years in Pittsburgh, Currie de-
clared: “I wish I could have gotten
here sooner. This is a major
market and you get paid a lot more
money."

Currie has one son, age 27, who
is sports information directior at
UMI. two teenage daughters, and a
foster son attending Point Park
College. The sportscaster and his
wife are estranged. Of his
marriage: “I am now serving a life
sentence for my one horrible leap
into the bottomless pit."

The North Carolina danday claims
to be a good public speaker, having
made his round of the local banquet

seriously.

right, of course. Stargell does de-
serve the honor, but probably
won't get it. But why worry about
it? I'd rather get a ten dollar raise
than be voted most valuable

“I read that Bowie “the Grand
Coon" (Commissioner of Baseball)
said Hank Aaron would throw out
the first ball in the World Series.

that the great pressure to bring
women into this thing will not
result in the wholesale hiring of
women before they have the
experience."

The sportscaster believes there is
a major change in Pitt football.

“No one - Carl DePasqua, Johnny
Majors, or anyone - could have won
the way Pitt had been operating
before,” he said. “Now they have
put more money into the "football
program and are rebuilding the
facilities. In about three or four
years I expect Pitt to become the

17th Century Recordings?

Lecture Gives Details

BY MAX EVERETT

Last night, Dr. David Fuller, a
guest lecturer from the State
University of New York at Buffalo,
presented a paper to a rather small
but interested crowd in the
Rotunda of the Henry Clay Frick
Fine Arts Museum.

The title of the lecture: “Organ
Recordings of the 18th Century”
seemed, at first, a misnomer.
After all, had history misplaced
Thomas Edison? Were recordings
as we know them today possible or
even thought of in the 18th
century? Probably not. However,
Dr. Fuller did describe a system of
recording or reproducing the actual
sounds of performances given
almost two hundred years ago.

The instrument used in such a
venture was known as the cylinder
or’ barrel organ. It was a
mechanical instrument much like a
player piano or music box which,
through an intricate system of
“pin” placement could acurately
reproduce the sounds as they
would have been heard c. 1790.

The discovery and analysis of the
music of-this instrument answered
some of the questions confronting
musicologists interested in earlier
performance practices, namely
those questions concerning the
ornamentation of keyboard music.

Dr. Fuller used as an example

George Friderick Handel's organ.

concerto op. 4, No. 5 which had
been‘ “recorded" by the cylinder
organ from a performance given c.
1790. Ornaments that were

MONDAYS THRU FRIDAYS

indicated in the score were
accurately reproduced as they
would have been at that time. It
was discovered that ornaments
were used on practically every
note, a practice which 20th century
performers of Baroque music find
overdone, or at worst distasteful.

Also, any one ornament, such as
the trill or mordant- could be and
often was played differently de-
pending upon the musical context.

Dr. Fuller performed the concerto
himself on the organ in the
Rotunda, and for most of the
audience it was the first opportun-
ity to hear this music performed
exactly as it would have been in the
18th century. To our 20th century
ears, however, his performance
seemed somewhat. frantic and so
highly ornamented that the musical
line was often obscured or
completely destroyed. From a
purely demonstrative point of view,
however, it did point out some of
the differences in performance
practice between what was really
done and what modern performers
assume was done.

Dr. Fuller's lecture was part of a
series of lectures and concerts
sponsored by the University of
Pittsburgh's Music Department.
Other lectures of this sort will be
presented throughout the year and
hopefully larger crowds will attend
them, for they offer us a rare
opportunity to meet established
musicologists, composers and per-
formers and to hear thier ideas
expressed.

  “Honey"

JOHN SMITH
ARTS EDITOR

A taste of honey is, according to
the song, supposed to be a taste
much sweeter than wine. Maybe it
is. In the work of a young
lrishwoman, Shelagh Delaney,
these tastes come few and far
between, and the current Studio
Theatre production of A Taste of
Honey is a sweet offering despite
the bitterness of the story.

That sad tale deals mainly with a
young girl coming of age. In
modern, naturalistic drama, how-
ever, this is never an easy task.
Eighteen year old Joe lives with her
mother Helen in a lower class
dwelling somewhere in Britian.

In the opening scenes of the show,
we discover that Jo is a necessarily
precocious and rebellious daugh-
ter. Her mother is at the root of
this trouble. A tense, neurotic and
overbearing woman, Helen is
almost void of any motherly (or
human) feeling for her daughter.
So, the situation is one of constant
mental destruction by both of the
principals. Neither is stronger, so
neither can win. '

Enter Mr. Peter Smith, a wealthy,
loudmouth letch who asks Helen’s
hand in marriage. Needless to say,
she is more than willing to accept.
Upon hearing thisnews, .Io’s
adolescent reaction is to find a
lover for herself. He comes‘ in the
form of a black sailor who promises
her everything and leaves her
nothing save for a Woolworth’s
engagement ring and a pregnancy.

After the loss of Helen and the
lover, Joe ﬁnds Geoffry. He could
be the perfect husband--under-

standing, willing to take Jo and the
baby under his wing. Only
problem: Geoffry is a homosexual.

Except for a few tight moments,
.10 can except that, because he
provides the love she craves. With
these developments, could matters
possibly end up rosey? No. Helen
returns, kicks out weak-willed
Geoff and says she'll take care of Jo
and the baby. Until she finds out
that the baby is half black. Exit
Mom, and Jo is left onstage and in
life completely alone, save for a
baby on the way. Through the
characterization of Jo, which moves
closer and closer to Helen’s
personality, it seems as though the
cycle has completed itself.

Perhaps due to the author's
youth, or her feminitity, the men
come off as sterotypes rather than
three-dimentional characters. The
females, however, were excellently
developed.

Anne Haggarty handled the part
of Jo with much skill. This ran the
full range, calling for a dreamy-
eyed school girl, to a rebellious
snit, to the eventual disillusion-
ment and neurosis which would
overtake her as it overtook her
mother. Because the central focus
was on .10, this character had to
carry the whole dramatic weight of
the play. Ms. Haggarty did this

The role of Helen gave Carol
Gnatuck a chance to display her
talents also. She struts. whines.

and bitches her way onto the list of
top-10 heavies. Although this
strutting and bitching was just a bit
overdone in the first act, she
mellowed to a fine luster by the
later parts of the show. Hopefully,
she can start as well as she finished
opening night in future performan-
ces.

But the poor men. Not only did
they have less to say in their
somewhat unmastered British ac-
cents, but what they had to say was
of much less value. Michael
Freeman as Peter Smith was at a
disadvantage because he had to
wear a patch over one eye. It’s
amazing how the blocking of just
one eye can affect the actor’s stage
presence. At times his speech was
garbled.

Tommy LaFitte had too superfo- _

cial a part to display amazing
talents. He was the black sailor,
the Romeo. He only had to love
and leave, and that was what he
did.

Geoffrey, Michael Cline, the
homosexual had the greatest
dramatic possibilities in the work.
But he was just too wishy-washy to
be convincing. So the score stands,
partlydue to the playwright, and
maybe due to the woman director,
females 2, males 0.

Despite these flaws, A Taste of
Honey is worth seeing. It is a play
by a woman, about women, but not
necessarily for women.

Some Sophisticated Voyeurism

BY M. C. PILECKI

With the current Watergate
hearings investigating governmen-
tal buggings, a ﬂick about snooping
certainly seems topical.
King’s Court’s . latest, Extreme
Close-Up, is right on target.

Close-Up begins with TV news-
man John Norman, at ﬁrst simply a
casual voyeur enjoying the sights
afforded by the brief fashions,
doing an investiative report on
invasion of privacy. His ﬁrst stop
is a shop specializing in the sale
and rental of spy equipment--tele-
scopes, directional mikes, the
whole bit. The do-it-yourself snoop
set tempts good old family man

A John, who finally turns into a very

sophisticated peeping tom, quite
reminisent of Window Rear.

His voyeurism, at first, seems
fairly innocent, more like simple
curiosity. He has some fun trying
out the equipment, and uses his
wits [at times] to achieve his
snooping goals. So it seems like
Nothing wrong with a little
snooping, despite what John
proclaims nightly on KBLA-TV.

But soon it gets to be an
obsession. John can’t even enjoy

sex with his wife without watching
it in the mirror. Even more
equipment (for infrared snooping)
doesn’t sate him.

The audience is drawn into this
voyeurism by an effective use of
[yep] extreme close-ups, which is
quite disconcerting. The viewer
shares in the guilt of a voyeur, in
his obsession, once the “innocent
fund” is past, the soon finds
himself squirming in his seat,
hoping no one “catches” him. The
film certainly does inspire para-
noia.

James Mc Mulland, as John,
expertly portrays the subtleties of a
man torn by a socially unacceptable

obsession and his own reputable"

image. The hypocrisy of his action
is totally glossed over, and seems

to say that anyone, even the
staunchest advocate of privacy, can
and will be a voyeur without hardly
trying, so _ that it is . almost
“normal.”

Thus the film doesn’t make a
strong enough case for the right to,
privacy it is supposedly advocating.
Despite the guilt shared by John
and the audience, snooping is seen
as fun, and nowhere does it hurt‘
anyone [except for a few embar-
rassing moments for John when he
is caught].

But, as whole the ﬁlm is well
done. It turns an, entire audience
into peeping toms for an hour and
aihalf, and has them leaving with
heads constantly checking behind
them.

Opinion

Movies or Menageries?

BY DAVE MAJERNIK

The behavior of some Pitt
students at weekend movies in
Lawrence Auditorium is becoming
outrageously intolerable.

Recent weekend ﬁlm showings
have been characterized by lous
running commentaries of every
scene, shouted disapproval of a
ﬁlm, or latecomers yelling to their
friends on the other side of the
auditorium. Most often these
offenders are intoxicated.

At a film showing during
Freshmen Orientation last June,
the continuous shouting was so
loud that no one could hear the
soundtrack even though the sound
was turned all the way up.

But misconduct at movies is not
limited to just the Freshmen. Last
winter term during a performance
of a musical betweenshowings of
THE WILD BUNCH, a group of
students forced the shortening of
thatiprogram by booing, shouting
sarcatic comments, and setting off
a ﬁrecracker, although the majority
of the audience was enjoying the
show.

Just recently, during a showing of
EASY RIDER some rascal
apparently high on something,

loudly shouted his comments which
echoed throughout the auditori-
um.

Those who are not interested in '
vigwing a film or who do not like

the film being shown should just
leave the auditorium and let the
others watch in peace.

One also wonders where are the

. Campus Police --who, incidentally,

are paid $7 an hour overtime for
“working” at the movies -- when
these disturbances occur.

A police-state atmosphere at the
movies is not desireable, but police
officers could ask noisy culprits to
either shut up or get out in the
same polite, low-key fashion as
ushers do in regular movie
theaters.

Perhaps if there were better
enforcement, these disturbances
would not occur since they are
obviously perpetrated by a small
minority of students who know they
can get away with it. '

Weekend film showings are
expensive. The films themselves
cost between $300 and $500. There
is an additional expense of security
and maintenance. If ﬁlms cannot
be viewed without disturbances.
perhaps it would be best to
discontinue them, and thus save
much wasted money.

It is amazing that college
students, who are supposed to be
more sensitive to moral responsi-
bility and individual rights, are so
lax about a matter of common
courtesy and consideration for

graduate students, faculty, grad-
uate students, couples, singles over

  cats’ Comeback Falls Short   

BY "BART MACK
ASSOCIATE SPORTS EDITOR
After suffering a complete
offensive breakdown in the first
half. The Pitt Panther’s comeback
attempt fell short in the final
minutes of the game as the Cats
dropped the season home opener,
20-14. to the Baylor Bears Saturday
at Pitt Stadium.

The Bears came into the game

 

and pointed his running game at
the middle of the Pitt line.
Baylor won the toss to open the
game but elected to kick off. The
kick was short and Pitt took over at
the Panther 36 yard line. Pitt coach
Johnny Majors immediately went
to the running game but the Bear
defense held tough and the Cats

A were forced to punt the ball away.

know if that third down was going to be a pass or not. even the running '

plays produced first downs. A _

half, he gained 85 on just nine carries. Pitt had 34 plays from
scrimmage in the second half, just 22 in the first. When it cannot be
assumed that Dorsett will get the ball is when he is most effective,
because it is tough, even for a superstar, to gain yardage when the
opposition has several people concentrating him. _

Another factor in the Pitt game that needs work is the ball-snapping
on place-kicks. In the Georgia game, a Carson Long game-winning
ﬁeld goal went wide, with a low snap from center the principle cause.
Against Baylor, an extra point snap was horrible, and the attempted

I kick didn’t get three feet off the ground. Fortunately, the snapping on
punts has not been a problem.

Majors and his staff have their work cut out for them this week. The
entire defensive line needs work, and it seems that the left side was
especially vulnerable. The secondary slipped badly from the Georgia
game as well. A

It’s almost like the beginning of the season again. We know that Pitt
has many outstanding players, and that it is capable of humbling a
team as strong as Georgia, which incidently rolled over Clemson
Saturday, 31-14. We also know that an unranked Baylor team ran
almost at will against Pitt. The upcoming Northwestern and Tulane
games will answer a lot of questions. This game could be the best
thing to happen to Pitt this year, as it will teach Majors’ _r_nen to take the
games one at a time. As for next Saturday, all I can ask is that the real

Pitt Panthers take the field.

Charlie Browns :  Clings,

Set IM Pace  

BY RICK SHRUM
“The kings are alive! Long live
the kings!”

Those words will never ﬁnd a
place among the immortal works of
literature, but they accurately
describe the Charlie Browns,
four-time campus intramural club
champions.

The C.B.’s opened their season

‘last Thursday night with an

impressive 13-4 victory over Psi
Omega fraternity, and appear to be

‘ odds’-on favorites to win their fifth

straight league title.
“It looks like another successful

season,” stated C.B. John Molin- ;

ari. “We have most of our guys
back, and we know each other well,

so we have an advantage over the }

team's that have had a turnover in
talent.”

The C.B.’s unleased a fearful 17
hit attack upoin the Psi Omega’s.
Behind the long-ball hitting of Bill
Stezoski and the run-scoring
singling of clean-up hitter Jim
Little, the C.B.’s rolled up an
insurmountable 10-0 nothing lead
going into the bottom of the fourth,
and coasted the rest of the way
behind the pitching of team captain
Art Park.

The C.B.’s broke the game open
with a ﬁve-run second. Stezoski
opened the stanza with a circuit
clout. Ed Roberts and Larry Long
followed with back-to-back singles.
Park bounced into a force play, but
Roberts scored on the errant relay
to ﬁrst. Park advanced to third

when Mark Obenreiber’s grounder '

was kicked, and scored on Bob
Scuilli’s base-hit. With_runners on

. others

second and third, Little bounced
his second of three singles through
the infield, to give the C.B.’s a
comfortable 6-0 lead. Obenreiber

_ added further insult to injury to the

hapless Psi Omegas, with a
run-scoring triple in the fourth and
a three-run homer in the seventh.

Although the Charlie Browns
appear to be the class of the
intramural league again, the suffer
from the same problems that the
less-fortunate dynasty-seekers do.

“We’ve had many of the same
problems that the others have
had,” stated Molinari, without the
typical feedback of sympathy that
have gotten. “The
beginning of the fall term is an
unorganized period of almost
anyone, and out team isn’t
completely settled yet. We’ve lost
three guys because they’re on call
from the hospital.”

“We’ve had some trouble
adjusting to the larger ball (Who
hasn’t?), which is a little odd to hit
and throw. But we think we can
make the transition before the

season runs its course?’

Day Of The T ailback

BY VINCE DI NARDO

It was the day of the Tailback at
Pitt Stadium Saturday afternoon.
And. from all sides. the Baylor
Bears got the best of it.

Panther freshman--soon—to—be-
sensational Tony Dorsett delivered
a commendable performance. rush-
ing for 121 yards on 20 carries--
including a 33 yard bolt. But. the
slippery freshman was not the best
Tailback on the Astro-Turfthis day.

Baylor Senior Gary Lacy was.

Lacy came into Pittsburgh
unheralded and steamrolled out of
town with two school records, two
touchdowns, the game’s most
valuable player award, and, most
important a victory for his
underdog mates.

In bruising. unspectacular fas-
hion. Lacy laced the ‘soft’ Pitt line
a school record 39 times (which by
the way. was the same number the
whole Pitt team ran the ball).

If he was unknown to the 28.322
fans in the Stadium. his 167 yard
rushing total made a lasting
impression. In what has to be the
understatement of the young
season. the Baylor Press Guide
says that Lacy. a well proportioned
6-0. 200 pound performer. “can
play."

Gary was the leading ground
gainer for the 1972 Bears and was
honored by being picked on South
West Conference’s second team.

He cam to Baylor from Wharton
Junior College, where he was a JC
All-American performer.

In the sweaty-hot visitor's locker
room afterwards. Grant Teaff. in
his second year as the Bear head
coach, shrugged off the great
performance.

“After looking at the films. we
thought we could be successful
running against Pitt." the Baylor
major domo said. “Our game plan
was to go from tackle to tackle.
Gary is not a really great runner.
but he is a hard nosed one who did
what he was supposed to."

In the Pitt locker room, Johnny
Majors--after giving a 10 minute
dissertation on not making alihis--
identified Lacy’s performance cor-
rectly.

“He did a very fine job." Majors
said. seemingly biting his lower lip.
“Our defensive line was the softest
thing I've ever been aroundii

Lacy was all smiles after a cool
shower. And. while toweling his
tired legs (admittedly) dry, he also
pointed to the line as the
determining factor. However, Lacy
pointed to the Baylor offensive line.

“It’s a great feeling,” the
handsome Texan said, “I owe all of
it to the offensive line. They
controlled the line of scrimmage
and opened up nice big holes.
When they do that, it’s easy to run
through them,” he saidmaking a

correct analysis.

Gary scored the first of his two
TD's on Baylor's initial drive in the
first quarter. darting into paydirt
from the two. His second six
pointer from the one came midway
through the fourth stanza and
proved to be the deciding score.
But actually. it was what he did
inbetween the scores which hurt
most.

In the first drive, a 23 play, 90
yard masterpiece. he carried the
ball 17 times. picking up three
crucial first down and 66 yards. He
took the Bears out of a deep hole at
their own one with a 27 yard run
winning drive. carrying for 37
yards on 7 carries. It was this 99
yard that broke Pitt's back.

“It's a great feeling." Lacy said
once again.

Young Harriers C01)

Easy ()peI1in,2' Wilt

BY RICK SHRUM

Prior to the beginning of Pitt's
cross-country season. Coach Jim
Banner looked upon the upcoming
campaign with the optimism
reserved for a six-year-old on
Christmas morning. After all, five
of his runners were returning from
last year's successful season. and a
WPIAL Class B Champ was
entering the school. The inexper-
ience of his underclass sextet was
of little concern to the Panthers‘
successful track mentor.

Banner's optimism appears to be
well—founded. as his harriers
finished ahead of the pack in
Saturday's California (Pa.) Invita-
tional. An excellent overall
performance by the entire squad
needed to win. as five Pitt runners
finished among the first ten.

Nick Martin paced the Panthers,
with his second place finish. Bob
Steele. last year's seventh place
finisher in the IC4A meet, copped
fourth. Bob O'Neill finished sixth.
Freshman Terry Wile eighth. and
Mickey Collins tenth. The
Panthers‘ total of thirty points was
four better than runner-up West
Virginia's total. Indiana (Pa.)
finished third.

“I was very pleased with our
fellas today,” said Banner. “They
each showed a lot of pride in their

performances. At ﬁrst, I thought
we’d be hurting because our
preparation wasn't as thorough as
it is for other meets. But our guys
proved they were ready.”

Banner's squad was definitely in
top physical shape for the meet.
Each boy reported to pre-season
practice in excellent condition. The
rigorous training period. consisting
of about 100 miles of road work a
week. honed the running skills of
the team.

“We've trained pretty hard since
the beginning of practice." stated
Banner. “We wanted to go into the
season in top condition, and I
thought our boys might be a bit
tired from the week's work.
However. they showed no signs of
fatigue. and performed excellently
for an early season meet.”

The'Panthers need more than a
repeat of Saturday's victory this
weekend. as Kent State's harriers
come to town. The Golden Flashes
annually turn out fine track talent,
and should provide a stern test for
the Jungle Cats. However. if
“Banner's Babies" keep away
from the few mistakes they made
Saturday. a long day may be in
store for Kent State.
