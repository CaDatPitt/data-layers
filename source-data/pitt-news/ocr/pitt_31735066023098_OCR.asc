  Attempts Under Vlk/aygByBeII To Trace CaIIsFor Payment

By STEVE GUIDAS
Pitt News Staff Writer

There’s no such thing as a free
lunch and as far as Bell of Pennsyl-
van-ia is concerned, there is no such
thing as a free phone call, either.

To the many individuals that
recently used in-house telephones
located «on. campus to make
long-distance phone calls, Bell will

be trying its best: to collect money
owed to them.

“We have various investigating
techiques in which-we can trace a
phone call back to its caller,” said
Noah Halper, public relations
representative of Bell Telephone.

“Some of the calls won't be paid

..for, many will,” he said.

The change’ in dialing status on
the in-house phones took place

Dave-Kovach was elected General Manager of WPGH radiO by acclimation

Monday night.

Resident students ‘planning to
live on campus next fall‘must'f5.ce
the‘ annual dorm lottery Feb, 4
through the 11. The lottery will7be
held in the main Towers lobby from
10:00 am to 4:00 pm daily, except
for February 7 and February 9
when the lottery will takeplace

from 1:00 to 7:00 pm and 10:00 am.

to noon, respectively.

‘ According to Donovan Hughes,
director of the University Housing
Office, the lottery system, institut-
ed last year, is “a number selection
processto alleviate the concerns

expressed by residents for‘ the’

reapplication of on-campus hous-
ing_.. _\ «
lActually, the_process limits the
numbertof returning students who
receive applications for the 1,906
available spaces, Hughes said.
The week-long lottery, with ex-
panded drawing ‘hours, should cut
down the long lines, a major

complaint among students, that ‘

accompanied the previous method
of room selection,~he said.
“Statistically, it ' makes no
difference when a person draws the
number,” Hughes said. “Last

year, for example, the last male to
draw got the number two.”
‘The magic numbers this year are

between Land 858 for males and.

between 1 and 1048 for females,‘
according to Hughes’ assistant,

Mary Lou Noonan.

However, should a student draw

the number 2000, there is ‘ ‘no need

to panic,” sa-id Jo Ann Woodson,
director of the Office of Residence
Life.

Students with “bad numbers”

can have their names placed on a’

waiting list, she said. They are
then notifiedas cancellations
occur,

“Students should allow time for
to clean up,” she _ said,
explaining that unchosen lottery

' numbers are assigned by notifying

the ﬁrst names on the waiting list.
Also, some students are eliminated
because of missing deadlines and
therefore the list is condensed, she
added.

Noonan said that this procedure

she said, of the 350 studentson the
list, almost all were

whenever a change over in Bell
computers occured. The result was

- unrestricted use of these phones

allowing users to place a call to any
place in the world.

The problems was discovered in
December whenever Pitt was billed
for calls made on the phones earlier
that month. On Jan. 14, Bell
corrected the problem returning
the phones-. to their orginal

restricted status of on campus calls
only. ’

In the mean time, the phones
were in constant use by indivi-
duals calling relative, friends and
complete strangers throughout the
world. _

.“We ‘ goofed,” said" Halper,
“and because it is our mistake,
we’ll credit the university for

_whatever they’re billed. However,

the» students should have known it

better. They knew it wasn’t theirs
to use. They’ll get billed,” he
added.

At the present, it isn’t known
how many calls were made or what
the total cost of the calls is.
However, investigation into the
matter has already begun in the
tracing of the calls. A

and even dissertations. They also
assist students with seemingly
simple problems with grammar and
usage, punctuation form, tone and
basic organization of the paper.

In addition, the workshop can

meet the special needs of students-,

for whom English is a second
language, no matter what their
native language may be.
Instruction is mainly tutorial, but
the workshop also has free written
materials and handouts available
on everything from outlining to
footnoting, and a reference library
that students may use in the office.

 Often, tutors can refer students to

other places for information not
available in the workshop.

“Chances are, if we don’t have
they handout you need, we can draw
up one up for you on the spot,”
said Smith.

Although they do prefer that
students make an apopintment to
visit the workshop, Smith stressed
that students could visit anytime
during office hours and have an

excellent chance of getting help
quickly.

Appointments are available by
the hour or half hour, with a limit of
two hours a week by appointment,
per student. However, any
additional consultation a student
may need is available by dropping
in the ofﬁce without an appoint-
ment, Smith said.

Smith recommends that students
who intend to use the Writing
Workshop should get an early
diagnosis of their problems and
avoid last minute pleas for help.
“Students should remember that
we can help them throughout the
writing’ process and we’re usually
able to 1 solve their problems
quickly,’-’ said Smith.

Most faculty members that
Smith has encountered appreciate
‘students. consulting the workshop
prior to tllrning in their work
because “they prefer better“
papers,” and,-he ‘knows of no
faculty members who object.

Pro osal To Increase Acti

By OBIN L. LUBIC

Asst.NewsEditor _
A proposal to increase the
activities fee will be
presented to Dr. Kimbo, vice-
chancellor of student affairs,
sometime" this week, according to
Student Government Board Pres-
ident, Bill Abraham at yesterday's
SGB meeting.

“Since the proposalpto increase
the student activity fee was
approved last week I have sent a
cover letter to Andy Smith, director

‘of student affairs for him to

review,” said Abraham

Smith has reviewed the proposal
and has given it his-endorsement,
according to Abraham. Smith's
recomendation will be sent to Dr.
Kimbo who must endorse the

proposal for it to go any further
through university channels.

Abraham stated he would like to
hear student views on the
increased proposal. _

‘‘I strongly urge all students and
student organizations to send
letters or stop in at the SGB office
and tell us their views on the
increase of the student activity fee
and we will relay their views to Dr.
Kimbo,” said Abraham.

Scot Hendler,—— board member,
also expressed his’ feelings on
hearing student views on the
board’s decisions.

‘ ‘We have made the commitment
to see things through but we need
student input and support because
our decisions represent the stu-

‘dents, ” said Hendler.

Also discussed at the meeting
was the Resident Student Associa-
tion meeting where the 24 hour
task force presented their majority
report.”

V “At the RSA meeting the 24 hour

task force presented some points of

their majdrity report which the task
force rcommends action be taken
on,” said Janice Faller, board

~ member.

' The 24 hour task force. according
to Faller. recommended that the
current 24 hour ‘visitation rules
continue with a few exceptions.

“The 24 hour task force only
named two exceptions at the
meeting. The one was that guests
must leave their ID cards at the
security desks. ‘The other
exception named was that over-

Draws High Number In Lottery «

’(C0ntinued from page I)

“We do refer students to
Off-Campus Housing,” Woodson
said, but added that this office only
helps students locate available
apartments in the Oakland area.

’Noonan said that by the winter‘

term there will be approximately
150-175 withdrawals from the
residence halls. Any students
desiring to move on-campus at that

, time would be housed on a first

come-first serve” basis, she said.
If, in the middle of the summer,
a student decides not to live

contract could easily be broken,
Noonan said.
‘ ‘ ‘This is one of the ways we move
up the waiting list,” she explained.
Hughes said that he has heard

complaints about the lottery

procedure, but in general it has
met ‘with “good response.” He
also said that there are proportional
percentages of each class and that‘
the system ‘can’t be changed
“without going to the other
extreme~.~”

“We’re not interested in having
4000 of one kind of student living

on-campus,” he said. .“There are
fewer seniors in the dorms because
more seniors have their own
places. But we can’t have seniors
without having freshmen, so we
house freshmen, too.”

The Housing Office has dis-

tributed a four-page procedure list E 3

which outlines the lottery system
and lists important dates.
Woodson said that students with
problems or questions are en-
couraged to stop in at her office, in
Tower C,‘ or the Housing Office, in

_ the Towers Lobby.

Plans that appear feasible in theory do not always
pan out in practice, and this might be a good message
to Pitt administrators seeking to alter the residence
hall visitation policy.

Two proposals aimed at revamping the residence

hall visitation policy were presented to Conney
Kimbo, vice chancellor for student affairs, yesterday.
One proposal was authored by a task force of
students, faculty, andstaff. The other was written
by John Vrana, assistant.» vice chancellor of business
and finance. Vrana was a member of the task force ,
but opted to draft a proposal of his own voicing
a different philosophy as to what should be

days.

included in airevamped residence hall visitation
policy,

The task force’s plan, supported by the Inter -
Residence Board ( IRB ) , says non — resident
overnight guests may stay in the dormitories no more
than 30 days per term, with guests not permitted to

be in residence any more than three consecutive

Special sign-in procedures also would be
implemented, whereby students would be required to
leave some type of identification card, e.g. a drivers
license, at the residence hall security desk before
staying overnight.

Under Vrana’s plan, 24-hour visitation and
overnight guest privileges would be restricted for
freshmen as well as upperclassmen, who would not
be permitted 24-hour visitation on Sunday through
Thursday evenings. Vrana also proposes housing all
freshmen in -single—sex dormitories because he
believes “freshmen need time to adjust to the
academic and social pressures of college.”

Although the IRB should be applauded for seeking
to circumvent action to severely alter the dormitory

visitation policy without sufficient input from

knowledgeable students, we might also take this

opportunity-to remind Vrana that his plan suggests’

reverting back to visitation policies reminiscent of
colleges during the 1950’s. Vrana might also be

reminded that he is dealing with mature. college-aged
students, not mindless juveniles, who should not be

forced to comply with rules more stringent than those‘

imposed, by many of their parents. Implementation
of such rules would only serve to oppress students

while marring the image of the university as a
progressive institution of higher learning. ’

Vrana’s suggestion for housing freshmen in single-
sex dormitories appears rather self—defeating.

Surely, Vrana must realize that isolation is not the
answer to social or emotionalimmaturity. Students
attending an urban institution such as Pitt must soon
face the reality of having to interact with students
from diverse age groups and social mores. "

Implementation and enforcement of ~ such

visitation policies is a major problem with Vrana’,,<E__,

proposal. How ‘might the activities of 4,000 students‘

,be effectively monitored by a staff of resident

assistants and security people?

Pitt students have come to expect and for the most
part respect their right to residence hall freedom. No
matter how stringent the rules imposed by any

‘ administration, there will always be a tiny minority

of disobedient souls who must put these rules to the
test.

Pitt officials must realize the repercussions of
taking this step backward in residence hall security.
At a time when enrollment at Pitt is on the decline,
implementation ofsuch a rule is certainly not a good

public relations move. How many students are truly

interested in attending a “progressive” university
with such archaic policies? ” .

Of course, on “a positive note, the Office of
Residence Life may not be faced with the problem of
too many students /and to little housingxif students

imprisonment brought about by these,-‘proposed

somewhat ignorant of Talleyrand’s
basic idiom, for many of our
options seem to be aiming for what
our country wants-the release of
the hostages-yet the second half,
le.aving or giving the appearance of
leaving the other country satisﬁed,
is being overlooked. Iranian
perceptions are crucial, and yet this
obvious targiet of inﬂuence is not
being dealt with in a way that offers
much beneﬁt. I ’
The Iranian perception of the
United States is that the U.S. has
blatantly interfered in '' Ira_nian
affairs since the events that led to
the coup of .1953. This is a crucial
element_in Iranian perceptions. In
this light, the breaking of interna-
tional law and precedent in seizing
diplomats is not that sacrosanct, for
in the Iranian view, international
law was broken for twenty-ﬁve
years through interference. This is
not the time to judge the merit and
justiﬁability of Iranian perceptions.
What is important at this time is
that they do exist and are a major
factor that must be dealt with in the
current situation. -

Free Phone Calls NothingNew

, Your lead‘ story of last Monday -

amused me. Free long distance
phone calls were a fact of life when
I was a freshman at Pitt in 1970.
The most popular phone was in the
the
information desk. The lines got so
long. at one point ‘that a sign
appeared by the phone that read,
to 10
minutes.”

Nobody ever paid for a call, as V

far ‘as I know. It was our

understanding that the university
paid a flat rate for all its .long
distance calls, so nobody felt
dishonest doing it.

After a whileit became a test of
one’s ingenuity to find phones in
out-of-the-way places in which to
make the calls. One phone I found
was at the computer center in the
basement of Clapp Hall. But I had
to give it up. The noise from the
keypunchers and high speed
printers was so great that in order

to carry on a conversation, I had to
put a coat over my head for

My favorite phone to use was in 

the elevator at Lawrence Hall. It
was quiet and relatively private. Of
course, I used to get some pretty

wierd looks from the rare pass: I '

They say wine gets better with
time and this adage seems to.apply
to the Pitt basketball team. _In
what could be their most impres-
sive win to .date, the Panthers
easily_ handled a tough Iona squad.
75-63, Monday night at the Field

‘A House. Itwas an important win for

the Panthers, not only because the
Gaels were highly regarded, but it

"brings them one step closer to

cracking the national top twenty.
Iona came into the game with a
12-3 record, led by an hqnorable
mention all-America, and owning
victories over Texas A&M and
Long Beach State. The Gaels also
had, a near miss against then
fourth—ranked Kentucky. The only
thing’ that clicked for them

iMonday, however, was the all-

America center-Jeff Ruland-who
lived up to press clippings by
pouring in a game-high 25 points
and_ pulling down 17 rebounds.
Despite its good record and
visions of an NCAA berth, Iona is a
team with one glaring weakness; it
is painfully slow; The Gaels do not
incorporate the fastbreak because
Ruland is slow on the transition and
without him they are virtually
helpless. Pitt capitalized on this
early, and by breaking out of the
starting gate quickly, never let up.
With Pitt’s guards making numer-
ous steals and initiating fastbreaks,
the Panthers jumped out to an early
17-15‘ lead and never looked back-
According to coach Tim
Grgurich, the game was two-sided:
“I felt the first half we played great
offense and really blew them out.
We felt we couldrun on them and
we did a good job. The second half
we were very sluggish and couldn't
get untracked, but at least the

them tough.” _ ‘

of this year's Pitt team. The
Duquesne game was won with
superior defense as was the Iona
game. When Iona threatened late
in the game, it was defense that
came through once again.

With Ruland hitting for 17
first-half points and the Panthers
holding onto a nine-point lead at
halftime, Pitt fans were a little
wary of the outcome. Their worries
appeared to be well-founded as
Iona opened the final twenty
minutes with six unanswered '
points and closed the gap to 41-37-
That was as close as the Gaels got,
however, as Pitt repeatedly stole
the ball‘ and set up easy layups. V

There were two keys to Pitt’s
second-half success. First, there
was the, play of the guards Carlton
Neverson and Dwayne Wallace?
Both ended the game in double
figures-12 and llgpoints respect-
ively-and the two forced numerous
turnovers with their pressing

' ball-hawking defense.

Neverson, the underrated junior
from New York, had revenge on his
mind. “I felt we owed them from
last year so I» was really fired up.
We tried to collapse on Ruland but
he’s so good that he got his points
anyway but we shut down their
guards pretty well,” he said.
Neverson, whose defensive abili-
ties have been tested again and
again against - the rival’s top
guards, usually comes through
with good results. He force Brian
Magid, George Washington's high
scoring guard, out of the game,
virtually shut down Duquesne’s B.
B. Flenory and against Iona, he

held Kev;n Hamilton, who last year

burned Pittjfor 37 points, to a mere?
half-dozen. 
The other key to the second half '
was the performance of Sam
Clancy on Ruland. Clancy held the
Iona star to eight second-half
points and without Ruland, Iona

“The judges in each event

conferred after each routine,” said
Coach Donna Sanft. “We’ve never
seen anything like that before. It
really ﬂipped us out.”

looked helpless. Clancy said

_ afterwards, “I wanted Ruland, so I
asked the coach to give him to me.

He was throwing some elbows out
there and pushing our guys
around. Frankly I don’t like the
guy very much.”

The Gaels did make a go of it
with two minutes to go when they

The coach also said that the
judges scored the‘ gymnasts more
on difficulty than execution.

“Our routines are more con-

cerned with execution,” the coach r

said; “If we have a move that is too
difficult, we won’t put it in._ They
actually had more form breaks than
we did.”

The Pantherettes lost to Michi-
gan State 135.2-131.55, but placed
well in each individual event. yln
the all-around, S‘tate’s Bonnie Ellis
was first, scoring a 34.65. Right
behind Ellis was Pantherette Holly
Martino with a 34.45, followed by
teammate Roxanne Evans with a
33.65.

Pitt gymnasts were first in three
of the four individual events.
Martino took top honors in both the
vault and uneven bars with
identical scores of 8.75. She was
also second in the floor exercise
with an 8.5. Evans was first in the
balance beam with an 8.55.
Spartanette Ellis was first in the
floor with an 8.8. _

“The teams were tremendously
evenly matched,” said Sanft, “and
if we wouldimeet again on a neutral
floor, I'm sure we could win.”

into the _same scoring problems and
came up short, losing 134-132.15.

Besong thinks the sidehorse is
the most difficult event because it

successfully. His favorite event is
the floor exercise. in-which he is
currently working on a move known
as the “halfin-half out,” which is a

Pantherettes, Ups

‘By MARIE HUFF

Pitt News Staff Writer

 Per the first time this year, the
‘ Pantherettes will be challenging a

team less experienced than them-

, .selves when they trek to Cleveland

State tonight. The Lady Vikings
list eight freshmen on their
roster, three of which are starters.
One of the freshmen, Dianne
Foster, is averaging 11 points and
11 rebounds per game. Although
Cleveland State sports a mediocre
record of 7-8, the Pantherettes
(14-6) cannot afford to treat them
lightly. lThe Lady Vikings have

After an impressive win over Edinboro, Pitt was

  
 

w r - . t,;a- ~‘-:*-.-_

been eratic this season, but they
have upset the big favorites more
than once.

Unfortunately, Pitt has been
upset once already this year--a
79-74 overtime loss to Eastern
Michigan this weekend. The
opening ﬁve minutes saw Eastern
Michigan jump out to a 10-2 lead.
Baskets were exchanged for ‘a
while, with Eastern Michigan
maintaining their eight-point edge.
Pitt fought -back with 12:30
remaining.

In the next three minutes, Pitt
allowed Eastern Michigan just one

upset in a recent game againstfastern Michigan.

basket. Jump shots by Penny
Welsh, Gain Aughbums and Pam
Miklasevich along with two driving
layups by Debbie Lewis gave Pitt
the lead, 22-20, with nine minutes
left in the half. The Pantherettes
held on and entered the- locker
room with a 39-35 lead.

Pitt jumped out to a 10-point lead
early in the second half, but it soon
fell to one. An Eastern Michigan

steal put Pitt down by one, 49-48,
but it took just two minutes for the
Pantherettes to bounce back and
lead, 54-49. ‘

Apparently it was never meant to
be, as Eastern Michigan again took
over the lead at the 7:00 mark,
S7-S6. Pitt's defense could not stop
the Eastern Michigan shooters
after the Pantherettes had regained
a 63-59 lead, and a jump shot with

23 seconds left, knotted the score at it

65.
Overtime play was dominated by

Eastern Michigan as they rolled up.

14_ points while allowing only nine.
Lewis finished the. game with 24
points, joined by Miklasevich with
19 and Welsh with 18.

The weekend was not a total loss,
as the Pantherettes scored an
impressive win over Michigan
State, 78-56.

Soph Frankenbach Mak s Splash 

By MIKE DICHIARA
Pitt News Staff Writer ‘

The women’s swim team fea-
tures six returningall-Americas,
ﬁve swimmers and one diver. One_
of the swimmers is sophomore
Linda Frankenbach from Fanwood,
N..I. —

Last year, as a freshman, she
was .all-Anierica in, three events.
including her ‘specialties. freestyle
and backstroke. Linda set team

records in the 500- and 1650-yard
freestyle as well as in the 50-, 100-,‘-

and 200-yard backstroke events.
During last year’s Easterns and
Nationals.- she ﬁnished in the top
three in all events in which she
competed, leading the team to ﬁrst

and 12th place ﬁnishes, respec-

tivley. ,
One of her biggest thrills last
year was competing in Easterns
and Nationals. The Pantherettes
beat defending three-time cham-
pion Rutgers University in Eastern
championships. "
For Frankenbach, the win over
Rutgers was important because, as
she says, Rutgers had been the
only other school tha I considered
attending.besides Pitt. Dethroning
Rutgers was very satisfying.”
Then came the‘ national competi-
tion where the team placed 12th.
Frankenbach placed in three events

a

in helping the team ﬁnish there.
She expects a top 10 finish at this
years’ nationals at Las Vegas.
Frankenbach began swimming
when she was 11 with the local
YMCA, and later with the AAU
Central .Jersey Aquatic ’Club.
_Although her high school, South
Plains Fanwood High, didn't have
a swim team, at 14. her career
began to flourish and’ she was
named MVP of the YMCA team.
She set New Jersey state records
in the 100- and 200-yard freestyle
in‘ addition to‘ the 100-yard
backstroke, all in the samemeet.
Frankenbach recalls one mem-
orable experience which occured in
her ﬁrst YMCA meet. She didn't.
‘hear the P.A. announcer call her
name to the starting blocks. By the
time she realized this, the

-swimmers were ready to start. Her

mother, who was in the stands with
the rest of her family, noticed that
she was not on her starting
position.

As_ she recalls,- “While -I was
running to get to my position, my
mother was frantically yelling for
the race to be held up, and the

judge did stop it. So" by the time I

made it to my position, I was

shaking in front of evervone.”
Then it happened, Frankenbach

false-started twice. That would

usually mean elimination but the
judge ruled that the block moved,
so she could try again. ‘

“Now I was so nervous that tears
ﬁlled my eyes,” she said. “From
that "time on,‘ I always sit by the
announcers’ table so I can hear my
name.”

The Pantherette swimmers are
coming off a’ 10-1 season last year
as well as being Eastern champ-
ions. _, ,2 .

Despite the loss of ‘ﬁve seniors

‘and two upperclassrnen who

transferred, Frankenbach said,
“This year’s team is well-rounded.
We have stronger divers. and» I
expect we should win Easterns
again.” ‘

However, she has been kept out
of some meets-due to tendonitis in
her shoulder, as well as some other
team members competing while
not being 100 percent liealthy.

The Easterns this year are at
Penn State and Frankenbach
admits repeating as champs will be
tough.

“Competing at Penn State will
be a distinct advantage for them,”
“But we still should
win.” . _~ 2
So if Linda Frankenbach regains
her health, her optimism may be
rewarded by’ a‘ second consective
eastern championship. A
