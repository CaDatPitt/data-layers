Pitt students in Cairo will leave Egypt

Ryan Shaughnessy
For The Pitt News

The last of ﬁve Pitt students meant to
spend the semester in Cairo is sched-
uled to leave Egypt from suburbs
outside the city today. The other
four boarded a plane to Istanbul
yesterday. ‘ _{

Lawrence Feick, director of the
University Center for International
Studies, conﬁrmed that all Pitt stu-
dents in the Cairo program have left
or are planning to leave Egypt. The
ﬁve Pitt students embarked at the
end ofjanuary for their prospective
study abroad at the American Uni-
versity in Cairo, where they expected
to begin classes this week.

Mass protests and violence —
which have resulted in several dozen

deaths across the county— pushed I

.the start date for classes to Feb. 115,.
The Egyptian government shut down
communication lines late last week,

limiting communication via e-maﬂ .

and phone. Pitt students were able
to communicate using cell phones,
Feick said.

Yesterday morning, four of the
ﬁve Pitt students —all participating
in a program at American University
in Cairo —-left on a bus to goto the
airport outside Cairo, Feick said: The
ﬁfth student opted to stay and wait
until today to depart. .

The bus trip lasted about 20,
minutes and the passengers. were
reported to have safely gotten to the
airport. I

At 10 p.m. in Cairo yesterday —- 3
p.m. Eastern Standard Time — the
four students safelyboarded a plane
headed to Istanbul. Feick said that
the destination would allow for easy
travel to other airports.

Four of the students on Pitt’s
program were supposed to study
on the island of Zamalek, located
in the middle of the Nile River right
where it splits Cairo in two, and one

had planned to study in New Cairo,‘

about 40 minutes -from the extreme
violence in downtown Cairo.

Feick said that the University rec-
ognized these students as adults who
had theright to stay in the Egyp-
tian city, but impressed upon the
students and their families that the
University would like them to vol-

untarily leave- V «

' It now appears that these Pitt stu-
’ dents will not be studying abroad in
Cairo at all. How the ﬁve will ﬁnish:

their semester — once they have
safely left Cairo — is unclear.
Feick is working withjeff White-
head, the interim co—director of Pitt’s
Study Abroad Ofﬁce, and the Ameri-
can University in Cairo program co-

ordinators to safely bring these stu-
dents home or ﬁnd them alternative
Pitt—related study abroad programs
that have later start dates.

Feick said that it is not academi-
cally feasible that the students will
be able to resume the semester‘at
Pitt because classes are so far along,

but assured that the University will

work with student on an individual
basis to see what is best for them.
He mentioned that students who
do not ﬁnd a suitable a Pitt program
or other study—abroad program
mightbe able to attend a college with
a later semester start— date and then
receive transfer credits from Pitt.
Pitt UCIS follows the State De-
partment’s guidelines when imple-
menting study—abroad programs
and heeds the department’s rec-
ommendations, Feick said. The
state department last updated its
travel warning for Egypt yesterday,

.. the other end,” Roth said. 9,

recommending that “U.S. citizens
avoid travel to Egypt due to ongoing
political and social unrest.”

Feick said that the recommenda-
tion put the future of Pitt’s study-
abroad program there in doubt, at
least for this semester.

“Future Pitt students will not
go back to the AUC program until
we are conﬁdent that the situation
dies down,” Feick said. “But we think
AUC has done a great job managing
a pretty serious situation.”

Morgan Roth, a spokeswoman
for the American University in Cairo;
said that the U.S. State Department
has offered transportation for vol-
untary departure and that a number
of students have decided that they
want to leave.

Once they get to a safe haven in
Istanbul, Athens or Cyprus, it is up to
students and their families to decide
what they want to do —- whether
that involves sitting it out and wait-

ing or making other plans to go back .

to the U.S., Roth said.

Roth also said that some families
have not yet been able to contact
their children due to communication
restrictions.

“There is sporadic Internet ac-
cess and very limited e—mail access,”
Roth said. “Nobody thatl Skype with
in Cairo is Skyping. Mobile phones
are now operating, which is how we
are communicating — via text mes-
saging or calling on mobile phones.
The land lines are working so for
a while we were allowing students

to use land lines and giving them V

phone cards to call home. But we
had to restrict their calling time to
one minute, just enough time to let

- students inform their families about

what is going on.”
She added that there are less than
a dozen phones at the university for

' more than 300 students to use, but

it is the best option the school could
offer at the time. . ' .

of mind about hearing that voice on

When was the last time you
did nothing? And by nothing
we don’t mean “wasting” your
entire weekend watching “Teen
Mom” reruns. We mean actually
not doing anything.

A new website, donothing-

web users to do absolutely
nothing for two whole minutes.

down to do nothing might seem

insane to a frazzled and sleep-

deprived college student. But
with new evidence about the
Internet’s effects on our brains,
we think doing nothing might
not be a bad idea.

According to The New York
Times, “Develop_ing brains can
become more easily habituated
than adult brains to constantly
switching tasks — and less able
to sustain attention.” Essential-
ly, our multitasking is causing
us to develop attention deficit

disorder.

In addition, constantly
stimulating our brains through
multitasking could be harmful
to our productivity. Why else

‘do you think employers block '

certain websites from their
employee computers‘?“A-ccord-
ing to 24/7, Wall St., employees
with PCs spend around 20 to
22 hours a week online, and
abouta quarter of thatvtime is
spent on personal matters —
adding up to five hours of lost
productivity each.week. So it’s
easy to imagine what sites like

—‘which are among the top 10
websites blocked by employ-

ers — do to your attempts at _

studying.

There is also evidence that '

getting new updates on e—mail

and social networking sites '

gives us a dopamine kick, which
explains why we feel the need to,
log in at least every hour.
While donothingforz m-
inut‘es.com might not reverse
the “rewiring” of our brains,
we think it’s important to show
how challenging it is to do noth-

_-ing for 120 seconds. Accord-

ing to a Huffington Post poll,
78.31 percent of the site’s visi-
tors were able_to do nothing for
two minutes while 21.69 per-

cent were not. Is it even pos-,

stimulation? V _ ' ~ '

Underages stick with students

Underage drinking citations can harm students’ job prospects down the line V

Tegan Hanlon
Staﬂ’ Writer

Police sirens can kill the buzz
at any college party, but espe-
cially at ones where the guests
are younger than 21 and intoxi-
cated.

_ Besides the immediate reper-
cussions of an underage-drinking
citation and possible penalties
from Pitt, having a criminal re-
cord could hurt students’ job
searches.

“If you are looking to apply to

medical or law school and let’s
say there is someone else equal-
ly qualiﬁed, they might look at
something like that [underage] ,”
Worgul said. “That could be the
deciding factor.”

Worgul said that people have
come to him with past offenses
they need to get erased to obtain
a job. . _
Pittsburgh attorney Frank

WW.CARE

Walker, who handles under—
age cases from students at Pitt,
Duquesne, Robert Morris and
Carlow, said that a citation can
have a detrimental effect on stu-
dents’ ﬁnancial futures, as well.

“Students don_’t‘realize the
effects it has on their search for
job,” he said.

In the law ﬁeld, Walker said
summary offenses such as under—

. age citations could pose a prob-

’ lem when taking the bar exam,
which asks test—takers if they’ve
been convicted of any crimes.

“You may think in your mind
you don’t have to report it —— I
was a minor,” Walker said. “It
will appear to them if you answer
‘no’ that you were somewhat eva-
sive.” ’ .

The general consensus seems
to be that the speciﬁc employer
is the deciding factor as to how
much a college drinking citation
will affect job applicants.

Internships could lead to jobs

Gretchen Andersen
Staﬁ‘Wri ter

A good day at some internships means mak-
ing it to 5 p.m. For others, it means landing
a job.

In fact, experts and employers said the
students who turn those internships into
jobs frequently stay after 5 p.m., and put
their full effort into everything.

Internships are becoming important in
hard economic times, when job opportuni-
ties are rare. Cheryl Finlay, director of the
Ofﬁce of Student Employment and Placement
Assistance, urged students to stand out from
others by staying longer at work, or even
coming in when not scheduled. .

‘Finlay also advised students who are’
looking for a job to demonstrate teamwork‘
skills and keep a positive attitude.

“While interning, seek feedback and input
from your supervisors and co-workers so you
can improve as you go along,” she said.

Another important aspect is to remain
professional and think of the internship as
an “audition,” said Carrie Kazmerjohnston,

Employment Development Specialist in the 1

Assistance.

Although it is not guaranteed that a

networking within the company is one step
students can take to turn their internship

“Make sure you put the work in that is

Baehelor’s degree offers
broad career prospects‘

Emily Marmion
’ For The Pitt News

When Kirsten Gardner graduated from Pitt
in 2005 with an anthropology and history

- double major, she didn’t exactly land a dream

job in her ﬁeld. ‘ l _

Gardner’s ﬁrst job placed her in the trav-
el industry, where she began working as an
administrative assistant and eventually ad-
vanced to director of marketing for a travel
company. ' V '

In some ways, Gardner represents a whole
class of‘Pitt graduates: those who apply their

, degrees to areas outside their ﬁelds of study‘.

Although she is not working in a career di-
rectly related to her education, Gardner
said the liberal arts aspect of the degree she
earned helped her prepare for the profes-
sional world. .
“I came away as" a stronger communica-
tor, able to express myself clearly and work
within a team environment,” Gardner said

Heidi McFerron:

sue internships and outside-the-classroom

V experiences. Such “add—ons to your degree”
are essential to becoming a versatile prospect

for businesses, he said.

“For example, »I recommend my students
take Software for Personal Computing as an
elective,” Novosel said, adding that the His-
tory department focuses on establishing work
ethic, developing verbal and written com-
munication skills, improving research and
people skills as well as critical thinking and
problem solving. ;’

Students begin developing a profession-
al work ethic in the history department by

‘ meeting deadlines and showing up for class,

Novosel said. . -
The history department is not the only
academic branch helping its students enhance

their professional appeal by developing trans—' _

ferable skills_.

John Gareis, undergraduate adviser for
communication majors, also ‘encourages ma-
jors in his department to acquire a balanced
liberal arts degree with an emphasis on writ-

e We try to stress“, quite often that a

major does not necessarily equal a

career choice. .

in an e—mail. .

Echoing the sentiment of Pitt adminis-
trators, Gardner believes that a liberal arts
degree provides students with transferable
skills that will help them succeed in whatever
career they decide to undertake. q

p“The College of Arts & Sciences provides
the opportunity for students to pursue skill

sets that will serve them well in a variety of .

ﬁelds  The student just needs to identify
what appeals to them and ﬁgure out how to
make all the tools available work for them,”
Gardner said.

Heidi McFerron, an Arts & Sciences career '
consultant, said that although she did not have -

exact statistics, students often enter ﬁelds
unrelated to their studies at the University.
“We try to stress quite often that a major
does not necessarily equal a career choice,”
McFerron said in an e-mail. ‘
More recruiters are attending the career
fairs advertising that they are looking for

“all majors,” instead of _a few speciﬁc majors, ‘

McFerron said.

The key for students, she said, is to gain
an array of skills through internships, in-
volvement in student organizations, Work
experience, study abroad programs and vol-
unteering. A '

Anthony Novosel, an adviser in the history .
department, also advises his students to pur-

‘ ’ ' ' ' . . K . ’ . ' . ‘ . ’ . ’ . ‘ . * . ' . ’ . ' . ’ . ’ . . , , 3

4|Al

ing and teamwork skills.
. “I tell majors to think of an, occupation

by anywhere that somehow involves communica-

tions,” Gareis said.

The possible replies to this challenge are ‘

endless. Pharmaceutical sales, for example,
has recently become a popular ﬁeld for com-
munication students to go into, Gareis said.

Using the skills learned in the communi— -

cation department, a pharmaceutical sales-
man has the abilityto create presentations,
coordinate projects and explain the beneﬁts
of various products, Gareis said.

Gareis emphasizesthe importance of hav-
ing many skills, no matter what ﬁeld students
are considering. l

Both Novosel and Gareis agreed that proﬁ— ’

cient writing is a necessity. Patrick Altdorfer,

apolitical science undergraduate adviser, tells _

his students not to “shy away from writing
courses.” p _
“Everyone needs to know-how to write,”
Altdorfer said. A
The political science department also aids,
its students in developing skills that apply to
other ﬁelds. ’ .. -

Altdorfer said the key transferable skill —

advocated by his department is critical think-
ing. " '

. F “justforreadinganewspaper,youhave to

think critically,” Altdorfer said. I

Oliver Bateman

In a crummy economy like this
one, the best place to look for
a job is outside the box. With

. that in mind, we’ve decided to

give you the straight dope on a
number of emerging industries.
Although it’s unlikely that every
single one of these will fit your
special needs_, they’re all a darn
sight better than ﬂipping ham-
burger patties or mowing your
parents’ yard. '-

Unemployment: Unemploy-
ment is the fastest—growing ﬁeld

in the economy.’ Most of you have _

probably been conditioned‘ to
fear taking a job like unemploy-
ment, but consider this possibil-

ity: When you’re unemployed, you .

can sleep 24 hours a day! Try to
think of any other career where
'that’s possible. Come on, keep
trying. Bed tester? Please. Even
then, you’ve got to stay awake for

at least a few hours to tell them
what you think of that mattress. ,
Unemployment might not pay
very much, but you can’t beat the

' beneﬁts. ‘

Lottery: We’ve promoted
the lottery before, so why stop
now? No matter how you look
at it, there’s no denying that
it’s the best and easiest way to
turn $1 into megabucks. Doubt-
ers might tell you that there’s a
better chance of putting a man
on- the moon than winning the
lottery, but hey, we might have
already done that. Looklit up on
Wikipedia if you don’t believe_
us. Anyway, there are all kinds
of lotteries out there and, un-
like more challenging games like
“Go Fish” and “Angry Birds,” you
don’t need to wastetime learn-
ing complicated strategies. Just
remember: You can’t win if you
don’t play! i

Starbury apparel: It’s always

of a hot new fashion trend. We

did this when we worked for Ab-
ercrombie'8z Fitch back before

THAT’S WHAT SHE SAID

 

Stop putting offnthe internship search andyou won’tbe bored  

Caitlyn Christensen
Columnist

Unless you’ve been living under a sun-warmed
tropical rock, you’re well aware that “gloomy
winter’s come again” — to quote an extremely
not—famous Scottish song. As I was lying on
my memory-foam mattress all weekend, sur-.
rounded by my corn ﬂakes, instant Netflix and
other reasons not to go out, I thought back
to last winter and what I was doing exactly
one year ago. Then I switched off the screen
displaying the girl inhaling computer dust re-
mover on “Intervention” and started looking
up internships. H

You see, I am a person prone to easy panic,
but last winterl don’t think I panicked enough

about my future. I was blissfully unconcerned '

as I skipped along the frosty streets of South
Oakland, thinking about boys and butterﬂies
and getting a BlueMax HD light for my seasonal
affective disorder. I was the polar bear that
grumbled all winter, convinced that summer
was never going to come again. Accordingly, I
didn’t have to worry about what I was going to
do when classes let out, my friends moved away
and my dad came to fetch me home in April.
Whatl ended up doing, of course, was noth-
ing — for about the ﬁrst three days. It was

nice until I turned into an apathetic bored-
a-holic, schlepping from room to room and
complaining about the air conditioning. Sure,
in the middle of f1nal—exam week I had looked
forward to “reading” and “watching movies,”
but you can only read for so long before you
realize that it’s been a week since you’ve gone
to a party, much less done a solid day’s work.
To keep from beingacomplete waste of space, I
went back to my old job, substitute teaching.

The point of that lengthy personal anecdote
was to say: Don’tbe like me.]ust because April

seems far off doesn’t mean that it’s not going to «i

come. In fact, it comesmuch more rapidly than
seems possible. In practically no time at all,
we’ll be harrumphing over our new sunburns
and how our shorts show off ourcellulite. As a
side note,. maybe winter isn’t so bad after all.
Maybe I’m_ the only jackalope out there who
needed this advice, but here it goes anyway: It’s

It’s never too early to startthinking i
abouthow you Want to spend your

summer.

Teaching involves a lot of things I don’t
like. First of all, it means I have to go back
to middle school, a place where I spent my

' darkest adolescent days. It also means I have.

to talk to the same kind of characters who I
didn’tmuch like at 13 and still don’t really care
for — other teachers. In desperation, I applied
to a last-minute internship in Washington, D.C.
Iwon’t name the organization, but the position
was just a little better than awful. I quit and
came back to Pittsburgh and spent the summer
hanging out with my friends. It was great ﬁm,
but nothing to put on a resumé. .

jumpdown my throat. It’s a great city, and I
don’t think I could have been happier going
anywhere else for college. But. as I’ve moved
up, I’ve realized how much I sometimes want

while you realize you and your friends — God

bless them — have been holding practically the- .

same conversations for the past two months.

THE STAMATIACK

\

Earning a degree might be beneﬁcial for some, -but employers are finding grads less thandesirable

‘Nick Stamatakis

Columnist '

Think about your college diploma
hanging on your wall after you
graduate. The recession has taught
us that this piece of paperlmight be
useless, or at least a lot less valu-
able than we thought before. Hav-
ing a bachelor’s degree no longer
assures you a job. V
This is, of course, partially be-
cause of the sluggish economy. It’s
not just that college graduates can’t
- get a job —— it’s that nobody can.
'But before blaming this solely
on a weak economy, remember
what a recession actually is: a pain-
ful period of readjustment during
which companies react to market
shocks and ultimately — at least
in theory — return leaner, more
efficient and more capable of react-
ing in a new world.

This means companies typi-
callyrid themselves of 1ess-cru-
cial employees and keep the ones
needed for the company to return
to proﬁtability. So in past reces-
sions, unemployment ﬂuctuated
wildly among those without col-

‘, lege degrees,whereas unemploy-

ment among those with bachelor’s

, degrees was largely resistant_to

market ﬂuctuations.

. The college graduates were pro-
ductive enough, or at least seen as
productive enough, to merit con-
tinued employment.

But that’s no longer the case.

According to the Bureau of
Labor Statistics, since 2007, un-

A employment among college gradu-

ates has increased from 2.0 per-
cent to 4.6 percent, meaning the
college graduate of todayis twice
as likely to be out of work as the

 

college graduate of 2007. This is

the same proportional increase in .

unemployment experienced by the
general population. For the ﬁrst re-
cession in memory, employers ‘are
cutting positions at equal rates.
Things are even bleaker for
graduates younger than 25 just
entering the job market. Not only

roughly the same as the national V

average, but according to the an-
nual Recruiting Trends survey con-
ducted by Michigan State, adjusted
starting salaries of college gradu-

ates have decreased’ almost $2,000 ,

since 1998 to around $34,000.
What is odd about the dismissal

of college graduates is that compa— A

nies desperately need the creative
and innovative thinkers college is
supposed to‘ produce. With com-
petition from countries like China,
aging worlcforces, shifting markets
and an uncertainand undulating
cultural landscape, companies

. have their ultimate survival hinged ‘
on being able to quickly adapt. Yet ’

if the hiring patterns of companies

‘ .prove- anything, college students

don’t seem to be their preferred
answer. T .

The results of the ‘Michigan,

State survey in fact say that em-

College ‘diplomas aren’t always a selling point

ployers consider students pro-
duced by universities today less
qualiﬁed and less prepared than
those produced ﬁve years ago.
Other complaints are poorer
professional demeanor, less ac-
curate expectations of workload

and lower skills and competency. '

The only area where employers are
impressed with recent graduates
is resumé presentation. —
Although Career Services de-
partments "deserve a pat on the
back for this, resumé creation
will not drive the economy of to-

— morrow.

Recent graduating‘ classes

simply haven’t shown incredible '

promise.

College unemployment,
therefore, might be best seen as
a reﬂection of companies simply
streamlining in reaction to a mar-
ket shock. ' '

Pittgrads stayput or moveto east coast

Sarah Simkin
3 Senior Stajf Writer

N o matter how fantastic their four years in
Oakland might have been, more than half
of all Pitt students are ready for a change
of scenery by the time they graduate.

According to the Office of Student Em— '

ployment and Placement Assistance, 54
percent of Pitt students who found em-
ployment after graduation did so outside
of Pittsburgh and the Western Pennsyl-
vania region. Forty—four percent of the
total number of employed graduates found
positions outside of the state. '

After Pittsburgh, Philadelphia is the
second largest city for Pitt graduates. Most
graduates tend to stay on‘ the east coast.
In order, the other top cities graduates
relocate to are Washington D.C., Baltimore
and New York City.

Jacob Spears, the data coordinator for
SEPA, said that students are drawn to those
locations by “a variety of things.”

. Judy Robinson, the community service -

coordinator at the Chesapeake and Poto-
mac Pitt club, said the Washington-Balti-
more metro area is at an ideal distance for
her from Pittsburgh and its surrounding
attractions. 7 S '

‘?It is still close to home and the Stillers
([three to four and a half hours by car),”
Robinson wrote in an e—mail, adding that,

A “Living in this area means a short drive to

a big city, the beach, the mountains and
the quiet countryside.” .

As for Philadelphia,‘ Timothy Pecsenye,/‘

president of the Philadelphia Pitt Club, said
in an e—mail, “I suspect that since Philadel-
phia is in Pennsylvania, manyfnew grads
feel like it is far enough away from ‘home’
to start their new lives and careers, but yet

, not so far that they cannotvisit family and V

friends in Western Pennsylvania.”

But Spears added, “I think the most.
important thing to consider is how big of
a draw Pittsburgh is for students to stay
here to start their careers or to continue
their education.”

SEPA reports that about one—third of ’

Pitt undergraduates continue their edu-
cation, and more than half of those who

do so attend graduate programs here at *
‘Pitt. SEPA does not track where Pitt gradu-

Ron Bennett said. “A government

"employer would c_are.”

To keep citations off one’s re-
cord, Bennett advises cited stu-
dents to hire an attorney, even
though the citation process does
not normally require one.

Worgul is currently represent-

ing a Pitt student, who initially

went alone to the magistrate and
could not get the citation off the
record. The next step is an ap-
peal. V -

“A benefit of hiring an attor-
ney if you get an underage drink-
ing citation is that most attorneys
that practice in Pittsburgh sort of
know the tendencies of a lot of
magistrates,” Worgul said.

Under the law, a defendant
must wait ﬁve years before apply-
ing to have his record expunged .
if he is found guilty of ‘a crime.
Worgul advises his clients to try
to get their charges dismissed

The process comes with a lot of
paperwork. ‘

To help students avoid mag-
istrates, paperwork and fines,

a people problem. Not all college
graduates add value to their com-
panies, and now, upon revaluat-
ing hiringprocedures, companies

’don’t hire as many.

Colleges themselves are ‘not
solely to blame for the perceived

decreasing quality of graduates. .
- The decline could stem from fail-

ing primary and secondary school
systems or even from other fac-
tors, such as a decrease in stable,
two-parent households.

Buteven looking at Pitt’s struc-
ture, it is hard not to place some
responsibility on degree—granting
institutions. In the College of Arts

& Sciences’ for instance, a “broad, ~
.1iberal:education” consists of

sitting in a half dozen or so big

lectures, shovingfacts into your ’

head, taking some tests and leav-
ing. After these large introductory
classes, students specialize quickly
in a major, possibly learning the in-
tricacies of post-colonial feminist
literature or Keynesian econom-
ics, but not ever really molding the

interdisciplinary thinking skills
and problem-solving abilities re-
quired by the job markets of the
21st century.

The system instead produces
experts in speciﬁc ﬁelds who are
often quite intelligent —— good
for technical majors and good for
aspiring professors, but bad for
the rest who will likely not even be
working in their ﬁeld after gradu-
ation. '

None of this implies that col-
leges only produce mindless idiots,
and there are huge exceptions to
the mentioned trends. But the

«market now shows that, to quote

the Michigan study, just because
you have a degree, “Don’t assume
you are worth more than you are.”
A college -diploma doesn’t prove
you can-think outside the box or
solve real problems, and employ-
ers have caught on. g

It might only show that you can
write a resume. ‘ ‘

How to stand out when applying for jobs

Professionalism, asking informed questions distinguish an applicant, while poor. grammar merits a quick rejection

Anna Weldon
Staﬁ" Writer

When applying for a j ob, there are many
creative ways to stand out among a sea of
applicants. But for Marc Jampole, presi-
dent of Jampole Communications, Inc.,
one applicant only made things worse with
a not-so—funny attempt at humor.

“Somebody once wrote a news release
as the cover letter, and the news release
was that this person had just graduated
and was staying at home watching TV,”

Jampole said.

A potential employer does not want
to read about an applicant’s lazy habits,
despite their potential comedic value. Al-
though-sometimes an applicant’s humor
can be a refreshing break from a boring re-
sumé, the cover letter is not the venue.

Barbarajuliussen, the associate direc-
tor of the Career Development Office, rec-
ommended a strongly _developed. resume
for every candidate. Every application
should represent itself in congruenge with
the prospective emp1oyer’s desires.

“Do the work forthe reader to demon-
strate the match between whatthe em-
ployer is looking for and what the student
has to offer,” Juliussen said. 4 _ 7

The little things make a big difference
— especially on the resumé,Jampole said.
Applicants should proofread everything
they send into a potential employer and

b be extra wary of typos and grammatical

errors.
Jeffrey Flick, president and CEO of
BD&E — a branding and design company,
also stressed the importance of a well-
written resumé-and cover letter.
“I’ve had people e-maili-ng me looking

for a writing position, and they have had A

bad grammar,” Flick said. “It’s an immedi-

ate thing. You can’t be at this level and have '

typographical errors in your letter.”

_ But the ‘resume is just the beginning.
After an employer has found an applicant
worthy of an interview, a new host of stan-
dards emerges. Though each employer
differs, one criterion stands out for both
Flick and Jampole: professionalism.

“The biggest thing is just showing
that you have your act together and that
you’re a professional,” Jampole said. “If
you do something first-class and classic,
you will be in the top 20 percent no mat-
ter what.” '

Juliussen also recommends certain

V techniques of etiquette. For instance, ap-

plicants should arrive 10 minutes prior to
the interview and should be profession-
ally dressed.

“ [An employer] expects the candidate
to do their research and know everything
possible about-the company. -They also ex-
pect the candidate to ask good questions.

   

This demonstrates interest in the employ-
er, and again, the fact that they have done
their homework,” Juliussen said.

Certain employers ﬁnd that blogs are
an interesting way for an applicant to be"
noticed. Jampole once had an applicant
who “wrote a lot of really edgy reviews,

-using really edgy, young language,” he

that you have your act to ether and
that you’re a profession .

Hickey: Dressing professional
outside the office '  

Tracey Hickey
Staﬁ"Writer'

 

It’s no secret that many college students

composed of head-to-toe Pitt Pride sweats
or skinny jeans and ironic T-shirts — ﬁnd
transitioning to a professionalwardrobe
quite challenging. Everyone wants to dress
to impress, but a goodblacksuit can be ex-
pensive or feel too old or stuffy for someone
Who’s still schlepping a backpack around
campus ﬁve days a week. On top of that,
virtually no one is entirely sure ‘what “busi-
ness casual” looks like. V

Most students are aware of the basic
tenets of dressing for the average day at T
the ofﬁce. Short skirts — anything above
the knee is in question — and wild acces-
sories are out. Dress pants and simple,
“polished” hairstyles are’ in. But there are
a few occasions that fall somewhere be-
tween the casual and the professional —
the occasions that involve co—workers but
don’t take place atthe office, that are sup-
posedly “informal” but mayhave serious
consequences for your future employment. A
These include interviews, ofﬁce parties and
“casual” meetings over coffee.

For these instances when you’re not on
the clock, but not off the hook, here are

some Do’s and Don’ts to remember.

Employers value positive peastexperiences with alumni more than a college’s overall academic standing

Ben Labe
Staff Writer

Amid the recent proliferation of

' college ranking lists and services,

many students are concerned
about how much a _college’s rank

‘matters.

In particular, a student re-
searching this type of informa-
tion might want to know: How
much will my college’s rank affect
my employment prospects?

Whether a school’s postégrad—
uation employment rate is attrib-
utable to the school’s respective

‘reputation or to the viability of

their average candidate is a dif-
ficult problem to‘ investigate.
According to Brian Hed-
dleston of Pitt’s Office of Student
Employment and Placement As-
sistance, _a job candidate’s in-

dividual achievements are ul—.
timately more important than’ '

where he went to school.
- “The employers that I have

asked said that they never even

thought about [ranking]  They A

base it more on past success,”
Heddleston said. i c
Employers usually end up
looking for job candidates iii the
areas where job openings arise,
Heddleston said. But they also
like to recruit candidates from
schools at which they have found
successful employees before.
Rather than trusting rankings
services to tell them where the
best students are, employers

cwouldvrather rely onformer ex--

perience. _

Even so, rankings have estab-
lished themselves as an impor-
tant component of.students’ de-
cisions about where’ to apply for,
and eventually attend, college.

B] Ore, senior associate direc-
tor of Pitt’s Office of Admissions
and Financial Aid, said rankings
are useful because they are con-
ducted by third parties who can
gather and compare_data' about a
variety of institutions. Students
can then consult rankings pro-

viders to ﬁnd a more objective A

‘measure of a school’s success,
rather than relying merely on the
boasts of the school’s admissions

Since thattime, he has been waived by the

g Employers often made decisionsbetweentwo 4
candidates based on the language _they use on

their proﬁles, according to the website. Raunchy
or racist remarks sometimes led to a rejecﬁon.
The ﬁrst step students can take togevaluate
their online image is to Google their own name,
Bianco said. It’s an easy trick that potential em-
ployers use _on applicants, so it’s important that
students knowwhat will appear in a_search.
Accounts like Twitter, Facebook and even
Flickrall contribute to the image a student might

equivalent of bringing the ofﬁce into the user’s

personal space and which can cause trouble if

users post rude remarks about their job online.
“Personally, I dont havealot of co—workers [as

» friends] on Facebook,” Graham said. “Linkedln

is obviouslythe professional [site], so there’s not
aconcem there.” ' 
The ‘concern, he said, comes as more ,'‘sites
appear andtheir rules become hardto'decip_,her.
Overall, he said, what’s considered appropriate

_ “depends on the person and the culture of the

oﬂice.” _ ‘ 
Graham also advised students to “brand and

project. Bianco often advises students inher own
classes to understandthe “presence” theyproject
online. ' . ~ ‘

“Think of it as: What would you be willing to
scream rightinfront ofyourwork ofﬁce?”Bianco
said. “That’swhatyou dowithsocial media. There
are behavioral codes. Even if on paper someone
is qualiﬁed, the reality is thatwe have to live with
each other. So online you create a personality,-
and notall of our personalities at home or out
and about will be the same as our personalities
at work. But what you have to be aware of is that
social networking is a public space with public
discourse and public rhetoric.” ’

Shawn Graham, a career consultant at Carn— _,
egie Mellon, suggests that students decide ahead
' of time what they intend to do with their social-

networking proﬁle and pick and choose what

informationwill go online based on their career. A
’ goals and values. '

Grahamalso discussedthe idea of “friending’ ’
co-workers on sites like Facebook, which is the

articulated throughout all of your networking
sites.” _ ' y  T
Another basic tip from Bianco and Graham
is to do research on a potential employer’s stan-
dards — some ﬁelds mightbe more relaxed about

' what they do and don’t mind seeing online, so
' understanding a speciﬁc workforce culture is

key. .

Asforwhattopost online andwhatto exclude,
Graham advised students to use “common sense.”
Maybe posting about that fantastic  last
night isn’t the best thing to do.

Keep in mind, as well, that setting proﬁles to
“private” offers no guaranteed security or privacy

—— understanding the terms andservices of a .

social—networking site is important.

“We actually used to recommend [that you]
delete your Facebook account,” Bianco said. “But
now that seems absurd. But you do need to con-
sider the image it projects. Ask yourself: Would
I be okay bringing them into this social space?
Because that’s whatyou’re doing.” I A

employers are in the same frigid boat as you

“I knew my opportunity would be small and
slim,” Malecki said. “I knew it was going to be
hard to getalook. Iwould have given ita25 to 30
percent chance that I would have made it.”

But if Malecki’s estimationwas correct, his
chances were relatively good. The NFL Players’

Malecki said. “In the NFL, the joke is that [‘NFL?] .

means ‘not for long,’ and it’s deﬁnitely true.”
Pitt’s athletic department hopes its student

athletes will excel after college, regardless of .

whether they end up playing "professional
sports. L ‘ .

With this in mind, Pitt initiated the “Panther
Game Plan” program in 1995.

The program’s self-stated mission is to

lineman Penny Semaia  a driving force in help-

" ing student-athletes map out their futures.
Semaia, currently Pitt’s assistant athletic "

director for student life, heads what is called

- Pitt’s “Life Skills Program.” It’s his job to make

sure that student-athletes are prepared for life
after school, both on and off the ﬁeld.

“We want to make sure we have a base
process for all student-athletes,” Semaia said.
“One thing we wantall of our student-athletes
to understand is that life continues on, even
beyond the sports. How we advise them is to

Interns .-
advised to

take initiative '

Internships  6

interns wasjulia Nauer, a 2010 graduate and

now assistant buyer in women’s denim.
Nauer said a successful intern should take

initiative and always ask if there is anything

. more they can do. . .
_ “I voiced how much I wanted to stay with
the company after my internship was over to '

anyone who would listen so they knew that I
really wanted to be there,” Nauer said. “And I
gave 100 percent to every task I had to com-

I plete, even if it was something small.”

Not all interznshipshave led to jobs. In a

“recent survey of 110 students, 29 of those

students were offered a full—time job as a
result of their internship,” Johnston said.

I Some clear negative behaviors interns
should avoid include complaining, disre-

specting co-workers, gossiping and bad- A

mouthing an internship after completion,
Johnston said. -

PNC, headquartered in Pittsburgh, offers ‘

an internship ‘called PNC’s Pathways Intern-
ship Program. . . ’ ‘
PNC also looks‘for interns who can work

as part of a group and can showthey are ‘

passionate about their work, said Kristi
Milczarczyk, vice president of PNC Cam-
pus Recruiting.

“A team player who is eager and open to
learning and challenging themselves and
who can demonstrate strong quantitative
and analytical abilities will go far,” Milczarc-
zyk said. ‘ - -

Milczarczyk said PNC looks for intern-
Ship candidates with an “excellent academic
record” in addition to wanting to work in
ﬁnancial services. ~

Finlay. said that it isn’t just the intern-
ship work that counts in hiring decisions
— grades do, too. '

“Don’t forget that your grades will re-_ '

main important,” Finlay said. “You need to

maintain good grades while performing your ~

internships.” I

prepare everything fora career beyond their
sport, and if they have the opportunity [to play
professionally], We’ll face that time when it

_ comes.” . -

Semaia’s inﬂuence. reaches beyond Pitt’s
current pool of student-athletes. During one
of Malecki’s runs as a free agent, Semaia was
available to help him set up interviews for man-
agement and sales positions in the Pittsburgh
area. .

Semaia emphasizes the importance of
avoiding tunnel vision in life, no matter what

students plan on doing for a living. He says
that preparation is a critical component of
success.

“It’s all about your thinking process and
your decision-making process,” Semaia said.
“What is going to be the best outcome for you,
your family and those that you love?”

For some student-athletes, this process
yields a decision to leave Pitt prior to gradua-
tion and enter a professional league’s draft.

Just as he does with any student-atl1lete, Se-

FEATURE

White Light -Black Light merges art and science

Liz Keeney

Staff Writer

“White Light — Black Light”
Jan Tichy and Finnbogi Peturs-
son .

Now until April 3

Wood Street Galleries
412-471-5605

In discussions of art, hertz levels,
sinus waves and ground elements
don’t typically get mentioned.

c ' Now, however, new advance-
ments in technology and research
have merged with the -art world,
and through the naturally occur-
ring mediums of sound, light and
water, artists can depict a land-
scape or theme without ever hav-
ing to put paint to canvas.

To showcase these. new tech-
niques, Wood Street Galleries
will host the exhibition White

Light — Black Light, featuring .

the works of Finnbogi Peturs-
son andjan Tichy, from now until
April 3.

Although the artists have
different styles and mediums,
all their pieces share a theme
— light -—- that unites the ex-

'hibition. But the artists use this
light in quite different ways, said

curator Murray Horne.

“In the case of Finbogi, sound ,

is used to create wave patterns,

and he uses light to illuminate‘

water on the wall,” Horne said.
“Jan uses digital light, TV and
video, which has a harshness, but
is still very arresting.”
Petursson, a native of Iceland,
has been working with water and

sound off and on since the late 1

1980s, and his work reﬂects
the many years he has spent re-
searching naturalphenomena.
In his first of two’pieces in the
exhibition, “Reset,” he uses a
large pool of water, two lights
and three sound generators, re-
ﬂecting_the image of the pool of
water onto the surrounding walls
to mimic the way sound waves
ripple and meet. .

The larger of his two works,
“Reset” is based on the way hertz
levels in the human brain change
as we enter in and out of dream
stages. ’

Gradually, the generators in

the walls surrounding the pool
change levels.

“Three hertz is the state
where you go when you dream.
When youfinish dreaming, you
go to 6 hertz and you’re quiet for
a while. In this state, the brain is
completely quiet and this is the
time for the brain to resetitself.
It gets into a stillness,” Peturs-
son said. 1

' Inspired by his home in Ice-
land, Petursson uses light in a

way that imitates the stark dif-‘

ferences between seasons in the
country. _i

“Iceland in the summertime
has sunshine nearly 24 hours a
day, maybe two hours of dark-

ness, and the contrast between‘

light and dark is very exacerbat-
ed,” Horne said while discussing
Petursson’s pieces. , '

As for Tichy, instead of fea-
turing the natural light seen in
Petursson?s installations, his
three works are lit with digital
light. ‘Combining video, pho-
tography and sculpture, Tichy’s
installations depict natural phe-

nomena recreated digitally, using *

lightto illustrate the different
spaces humans occupy.
“Installation No. 6 is ap-
proaching space from an urban
perspective. The second instal-
lation explores physical space
around us, where we go through
every day. And Installation‘No.
11, from 2010, explores the open
space, the desert and the sea,”
Tichy said. '
Drawing from the many dif-

.. ferent places he has lived over the

years —- from Prague, to Israel to,
most recently, Chicago — Tichy
illustrates the landscapes around

‘ him using projection and pho-

tographs. A

Bothartists draw heavily from
their surroundings for inspira-
tion for their pieces, a practice

Petursson-believes is inevitable

with any kind of art, regardless

. of medium.

“I think with all cultural acre-

. ation, you always act as a mirror.

You see-a lot of landscape in my
pieces -— although it’s harder to
point out in-contemporary art,
but you always have a feeling of
where they’re‘ from,” Petursson
said. I
