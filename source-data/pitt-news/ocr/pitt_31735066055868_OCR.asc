A green awning over a platform with a podium, several chairs,
six shiny new shovels, and numerous pots containing ﬂowers water-
ed by the rain covered the future site of the Hillman Library at
ground ‘breaking after Commencemention Monday.

Two speakers at the ceremony at the corner of Bigelow Boule-
vard and Forbes Avenue, represented the contributing organizations.

Third Announcement

A third announcement, noting
the change in name ‘of the gradu-

ate School of Library and Infor-
mation Science, highlights the
importance which the University
attaches to its Commencement.

The NASA grant will spon-
sor a major effort to close the.
time gap, often years long, be-
tween the discovery of new
scientific information and its
actual use by business firms.
More precisely,‘ the grant will ..
enable the University to col-
lect information made during
all NASA-founded space pro-
jeets, and feed relevant know-
ledge back to nearby business
firms in need of such informa-
tion.

This phoject, according to the
Chancellor, “comprises one of the
most important elements of the
University’s new Space Center. We
also intend,” he continued, “that

Cornerstone Laid For Space
Research Coordination Center

Yesterday’s cornerstone laying for the University’s Space Re-
search Coordination Center, space headquarters building, was per-

formed by three Congressmen, two National Aeronautics and Space,

Administration (NASA) representatives and Chancellor Edward H.
Litchﬁeld. -

The space building, financed by a one and a half million dollar
grant from NASA, will temporarily house the new knowledge avail-
ability Center and will serve as the base for the University’s inter-
disciplinary space research program ‘and industrial spin-oﬁf efforts.

The Space Research Coordination Center, located next to Thaw
Hall at the intersection" of O’Hara Street, Bigelow Boulevard and
Parkman Avenue,.surrounds the natural sciences, health" and engi-
neering areas of the University.

Cornerstone Laid .

The three United States Congressmen who assisted in the corner-
stone laying were Senator Hugh Scott, Representative William‘ S.
Moorhead, and Representative James G. Fulton. Director of grants
and research contracts, Dr. Thomas L. K. Smull, and director of policy
planning, Dr. Thomas P. Murphy, represented NASA. A

of the Natural Sciences said that space studies will’ cover the

sg_e"’z — THE i§11*'r_~NEws-”-

.-Come Blo w Your Ilorn

‘ _, ' In the stiﬂing dampness of Syria Mosque Monday
morning the families and friends of over 2,500 stu-
- dents honored that day sat in the aisles and stood by
bopen windows in the top balcony to witness the com-
-‘ mencement ceremony. U . -
' For them what Lawrence Quincy Mumford said in
‘ the opening lines of his speech was true - a commence-

ment address neither adds to or detracts from the senti-

-‘merit of graduation. It is true because the very nature

of Mumford’s address, the whole disclosure of Knowl-
' edge Availability systems, meant nothing to themin
,1 light of their personal attachment to that day.

, This is not to say that the University’s pioneering
Lin this ﬁeld should not receive the highest commenda-
i‘it3,ion.’This is not to say that the four honorary degree
‘. recipients, including Dr. Mumford, are not distinguished
‘men in their ﬁeld deserving of such praise‘. , V

g _. ‘But this was not the place to emphasize the Uni-
' versity’s progress. ' g

1'-In his introductory remarks, Chancellor Litchﬁeld
 flexplained that the University traditionally attacks . an

1 area of concern at Commencement , and usually an-
/ nounces advances in program to deal‘ with it. _ ‘U V
 : ‘There are few students who are not proud of the
A’ .University in this respect. They have faith in the Chan- 
I cellor’s strides and anticipate telling their children with
pride that they went to school here duringitstransition. 

But the University should not blow its own horn. at‘?
1' . ,,Commencement. This is the time to honor the students’
' progress not the school’s. Harvard has its annual student
speaker at its graduation ceremonies, Other institutions
have prominent faculty members speak or an inspiring

‘public ﬁgure such as Sargent Shriver or ‘Barbara Ward, ,
' who spoke at a fall convocation here three years ago.

V Each of these has a challenging message, an .inspir-
‘ing message, a personal contact with the proud students
 receiving their sheep skins that day. There is no reason
by Why a Commencement speaker should fail to arrest his

‘audience — whether on the ‘Cathedral lawn or in the
L stuffy Mosque -— provided he is contracted to speak on

an appropos topic. There is no reason to avoid conven-

tion. I '
Let the students glory this time.

,Hillman Library At Ceremony

(Continued from Page 1) -
_ The representative for the Hillman family and foundation was
‘: Henry L. Hillman, son of J. Hartwell Hillman, Jr. for whom the
library is named.

 Hillman, member of the Board of Trustees of the University and
President of the Hillman Foundation, which contributed‘ over three
million dollars, said that a machine has developed which makes it
possible to reduce written material so that a “sizable library can
be carried in a brief case.”

_ The threat of new and changing technology makes “better

education the only long lasting solution” Hillman" added. The

library. will make the University more effective, give a better
education, and lead to the growth of the city, commonwealth,
and nation. _

Chancellor Edward H. Litchﬁeld said that this was “not just;
"another building” nor another> library. The Hillman Library is at
‘necessary-‘part of the academics and is “central to the whole in-
stitution and its academic program.”

_ 1' Dr. Litchﬁeld added that the library is a symbol of the renais-
‘- sance of the University begun nine years ago. ~ . '

,  Members of the platform included Mayor Joseph Barr; Mrs. Jane
_ Hartwell Hillman; Captain William Fisher, Director of Building
and Grounds for the University; Lorena A. Garloch, Associate Di-

Robie Explains Choice of PAAfor Dance Site

By VIJAY JAIN

Fred,S_._ Robie, Director "of Alumni Activities, explained his posi-,
tion in. selecting the Pittsburgh Athletic Association as the site for‘

General Alumni Associationdance on Friday. ,

Barry Gross, an alumnus of the University and former staff writer
for The Jewish Chronicle, had protested the action to ‘Robie, alleging
‘that the PAA discriminates against Negroes and Jews. I

The Chronicle story states that Louis Mason, Jr., director of the
Mayor’s-‘Commission on Human Relations was contacted, and after
checking he stated that there were no Negro members and that Jews
cannot be members now. ' , ‘ I

that to his knowledge there was a Jewish member of 'PAA,l\/Iilton
K. Susm-an a Chronicle columnist admits that he is a “Jewish
member of PAA but estates in his "column that heis “a.-holdover
from an early day before the anti-Jewish taboo was-‘quietly but.
'--firmly imposed.” I -— A
‘Dr. Edgar B.,Cale, Assist’ar.1t.Chancellor of Development who
oversees alumni activities, reiterated the Universitylpolicy issued
last year which in part: states, “The University will not affiliate with,

nor extend recognition to, any group or association having policies
whichdiscriminate against individuals because of their race, religion,
or national origin.” ' .-

The statement had been made due to alleged discrimination in
certain fraternities and sororities and in the University Club and‘ PAA
where numerous University functions were held. '

Robie admitted that an individual did call him and had oh-
"jected to PAA asvthe site of the alumni dance as.an alumni but,
“he did not state that he was a reporter for The Jewish Chronicle _
nor-did he ask my permission to quote me in a news story. I have
never met or talked with Susman.” ‘

Robie said thatin the past the‘ dance has been held at the
Webster Hall Hotel but this‘ year when the hotel was contacted it
had already been rented for the evening for _Schenley High School's
prom. - -

“There is _a scarcity of large enough places in Oakland to hold

-such affairs where alcoholic ‘beverages can _be served,” Robie- ex-

plained. He stated that he likes to have the dance near the campus
area so that alumni cantake guided tours of nationality rooms, tower

did not explore the possibility of holding -thefdanc,e_ downtown. .-
" The General AlumniI"A'sisociation,‘ he.said,' is a voluntary organi-

;. V Of all of history’s vain at-
tempts to wipe the human
race off the face of the earth

perhaps the most ridiculous
of the lot was the agony of
the monarchies known at the
time as_ the Great War and since

 1939 as the First World War.

_ No nation in Europe entered
— ‘into that conflict with a clear con-
science and every one of them
came, out of it with a shattered
generation and a dread of war
.which was to make a second glo-
bal conﬂaguration inevitable.

It-was a war of interests. It was
‘not a struggle of the democratic
'~ ‘(nations against the morally cor-
. erupt Fascist dictatorships as was
the Second World War. It was, in
short, a mess.

Germany wanted her place -in

the sun; France wanted to avenge
the Franco-Prussian humiliation
‘ -of 1871; England wanted to keep
Germany off the seas; Serbia
/wanted to set up an empire of the
-Serbs; Austria-Hungary wanted to
keep the ramshackle dual-mon-
archy from falling apart at the
seam; and Nicholas the Last of
Russia wanted to send as many
. peasants as he could off to war to
~ “keep them from shooting up his
A ' family at home.

    

No matter what the Treaty
of Versailles says, Germany
was not the only nation that
should have been blamed for
the war. They were all at fault
and each must assume its fair
share of the guilt for the mass
slaughter and destruction.

tions which emerged from the war

 I make that war the last war—for-
' ‘ ever. The story of this vain at-
' t_empt and the reason why it failed
is »..the topic of Mr. Wilson’s 1/Var
(Doubleday and Company, 517
pages, $6.95) by novelist John
Dos Passos. 2 ~

 

. Unfortunately, Dos Passos never

’ ‘does get around to saying that this
, .- is the theme of his book. I was
4, _ able to glean this important bit
‘ -I of information from the dust
jacket of the book, but then again
 cover blurbs are not usually in

the habit of knocking their au-
thors.

   

Dos Passos never seems to
be quite_sure of just what it is
that he is trying to do with his
material, and there is just
scads of it to do something with.
Sometimes it appears that he is
merely attempting to write a
simple, readible account of the
war era. If so, then there are
numerous p l a c e s throughout
where he bops the Kaiser right '
on the button. However, in other
sections he wallows in endless
and mostly useless detail, and I
would advise a box of No-Doz
and a. wet towel to keep you
awake.

B.ut_maybe that isn’t what he is
trying to do at all. Perhaps he is
trying to write a history book
which has some sort of thesis to
advance. If so, it certainly isn’t
very clear. Of course, amid all
the trivia on the _home life of

half a hundred “great” Americans

of the period, it is difﬁcult to see"

much of anything.

And -the mistakes! The man

doesn’t know the meaning of the _

word “accuracy.” In one section
he talks of tne difficulties which
an Allied force in Greece is hav-
ing with the neutralist Greek
King in contrast to the ‘troubles
which the Turkish army is giving
them. Unfortunately for Mr. Dos
Passos, there wasn’t a Turkish
soldier within ﬁve hundred miles
of this particular Allied army. The
enemy they were facing was a
Bulgarian force. ’ ‘

Again in his discussion of. the
naval battle of Jutland, he en-
ters into a nice detailed list of
the casualties on both sides and
in ﬁve out of seven cases fails
to give the co'rrect types of ships
lost by the combatants. Any-
one who would call a battleship
a heavy cruiser or a rickety old
tub a “ﬁrst-class battleship”
simply hasn’t bothered to check
his facts. .

Insigniﬁcant as these mistakes
might appear, they do cast dis-
credit on all his data and make
whatever conclusions he might ar-
rive at seem questionable.

On the other hand, perhaps Dos
Passos is not trying to write an
“accurate” history book at all.
Perhaps he is trying to present a
picture of the age of Wilson, but
I really doubt it, because no one

for hours presenting theories as
to the theme or‘ motive of the
book, but there just isn't suffi-
cient evidence to merit giving
any one of them the nod.

That’s the wholettrouble with
the book. It‘s impossible to tell
what kind ofbook it is just what
it’s supposed to be about. It’s
about Woodrow Wilson and then
again it really Isn’t; it’s about the
First World War and then again
it_’s about American politics; in
some places it reads likea novel

and then again in: others it reads-

like a doctor’s thesis in Electrical
Engineering. ‘

It is supposed to be about an
era, then what about that era?
Dos Passos never really says any-
thing. He has simply collected all
the relevant material on A_merica
in the World War One era and has
spread it sloppily on his pages
like aﬁrst grader slinging ﬁnger
paint. It has no motive, no theme.
