Greeks move to make parties safer

By Matt Groff
Staff Writer

The Inter-Fraternity Council
is taking major steps to revamp
its social policies and reassure
Greek party goers of the safety
of fraternity events. The
GAMMA (Greeks Advocating
the Mature Management of
Alcohol) and social monitoring
committees are leading the
campaign.

‘GAMMA co-chairperson
Brian Fetsko said that this is
not a new committee to the
IFC, but that GAMMA intends
to start playing a larger role in
Greek life.

“We are aiming to have one
GAMMA representative desig-
nated at each fraternity party,”
he said. “The representative
will rotate from week to week

.... -.

so the responsibility is shared.”

The GAMMA representative
will be required to stay sober
the entire night and be of
assistance to anyone who has
had too much to drink. He will
also insure that a poster with
various campus and local safe-
ty numbers is easily visible to
people at the party.

“It’s important to realize the
reps will not be policing the
party,” Fetsko said. “But if
someone intoxicated is trying
to leave a party, the reps will
call a shuttle or taxi and make
sure the person would get
home safely.”

Jason Huey, internal vice
president of IFC, recently

attended the Northeastern
Inter-Fraternity Council con-
vention and said he learned
more about GAMMA as a

national organization.

“We need to concentrate on
the fact that this program is
intended for brothers to help
each other,” Huey said. “I
think in the past it has not
been popular because it [has
been] regarded as a policing
type organization.”

The key to this program,
according to Huey, is that each
chapter must take the initiative
and make theeffort to partici-
pate. Chapters must realize
that they are responsible for
what happens at their parties.
Huey said he’d like to see a
joint program in_the near
future with the Panhellenic
Association to insure that no
awkward situations would
occur for sororities.

“It’s important that as a coin-
mittee, GAMMA’ communicates

Poll shows grad students don't shuttle

By Pete Oppelt

Staff Writer

Recent ‘statistics from Pitt’s
Department of Transportation
show that less than 3 percent of
graduate students use the newly-
instituted shuttles every day. This
has prompted graduate student
leaders. to step up their fight to
have the $30 shuttle fee abol-
ished.

Graduate and Professional
Student Association President
Steve Parks said GPSA is writing
letters and scheduling meetings
with Pitt’s administration to
appeal the fee, which will go into
effect next fall.

Parks said that GPSA proposes
that those who want to ride the
shuttles instead could buy an ID
sticker that will operate as a shut-
tle pass.

If the administration refuses its
request, Parks said the GPSA will
lobby state Rep. Ronald Cowell
(D-34) to have the $30 fee
declared a tuition hike which
would put Pitt over the allowable
state tuition increase limit. Schools
that exceed this limit are not eligi-
ble for state funds.

To avoid losing state funds, and
since graduate school tuition does
not have an increase cap, Parks
said that in this case Pitt might
raise graduate tuition to cover the

shuttle cost.

“The fee will represent the
administration shuffling off a
tuition increase on graduate stu-
dents,” Parks said.

The statistics, provided to the
GPSA by Transportation Director
john Morgan, were compiled
from counting riders from Feb. 25
to 29 and show that only about
250 of over 9,700 graduate stu-
dents use the service every day.

The GPSA has collected over
100 signatures and letters protest-
ing the shuttle fee, and one gradu-
ate student organization, the Bio-
Medical Graduate Student
Organization, is writing a waver
to refuse to pay the $30 charge.

“We are trying to get as

will take away any element of

Pitt ‘chosen
to test new

AIDS drug

By Pete Kapustynski

Asst News Editor

The University of Pittsburgh
Medical Center has been chosen
as one of three sites in the
United States to conduct testing
of a new AIDS chug, L661.

L661 belongs to a new class of
drugs that laboratory studies
have shown will halt the growth
of the AIDS virus.

The Pittsburgh Treatment
Evaluation Unit will randomly
separate the participants into
two groups. Currently, the test-
ing will combine L661 with AZT
(zidovudine) to treat one group,
while the control group will get
AZT alone. However, if separate
pharmacology studies show it is
safe to combine ddl (dideoxyi—
nosine) with L661, then both
groups will also be given ddl.

“This is a critical trial to deter-
mine whether these different
drugs given together can stop
the AIDS virus from growing.
We are very excited about the
possibility that this strategy will
work,” said John Mellors, assis-
tant professor of infectious dis-
eases and principal investigator
on the study.

The PTEU will enroll 40 indi-
viduals infected with HIV for a
24-week study. Participants must
have a CD4 cell count of less
than 250, be able to tolerate 500
mg of AZT per day, and must
have been treated with ddI for at
least six months, but not during
the past month. Participants will
have to make weekly visits to
the UPMC for monitoring.

For more information, call the
PTEU at 647-8125. All calls are
confidential.

other and divided into three
sections.

The tools of the game are the
pyramid, a plastic sphere the
size of a softball and many feet
of rope or pool ttibing to create
the circles and sections. That
part is pretty simple. But then
there are the rules.

The object of the game is to
throw the ball off the face of
the pyramid in a way so that
your opp()nent cannot catch it.
The ball cannot fall inside the
inner circle, or shoitline, or out-
side the outer circle. Each team
has a player in each section and
they cannot leave that area.
Running with the ball after
catching it is allowed, but only
in one section. Passing is
allowed of course, but it is lim-
ited.

“For a spectator, it is tough
for them to see what’s going
on, but once you step on the
court it is pretty easy to catch
on,” said the inventor, New
Yorker Mark Miller.

Trangleball was born in
Brooklyn at Miller’s music stu-
dio, when Miller bounced a ball
off a corner of a ceiling and
now, and two years later, Miller
and his partner, Frank Re’/.,
have spent around $1(),()()()
developing and marketing the
game. He sold his music studio
in New York to devote all his
time to Trangleball.

“I told my partner that we’re
going to be rich,” Miller said.

just before Spring Break last
year, Miller spoke to

CEO and President Richard
Tar’/.ian, who control much of
the Spring Break beachfront,
about getting room on the
beach to showcase his game.
Miller said he was offered 25
square feet of space, which is
only enough to encompass the
shortline.

So Miller stayed in New York,
going to Fire. Island’s Ocean
Beach last summer to display
Trangleball. With his one game

Four Pitt seniors
enjoy one last ﬂing

By Jason Hillman
Editor in Chief

A last fling. One last
party-filled week before
looking the real world in
the face.

Eileen Daniels,
Malarkey, Sandy Pogue
and Wendy Baurngartner
decided to have that last
fling on thelbeaches in
Panama City Beach during
Pitt’s Spring Break. The
four of them roomed
together in the Holiday
Inn.

“I wasn’t sure if I wanted
to go or not because I
want to save money to buy
a car and stuff,” Pogue
said. “But I thought I’ll just
splurge one last time.”

Pogue, who roomed with
Daniels and Malarkey as

sophomores and has
known both since their
first year, is a

business/sociology dual
major. On Thursday, she
saidthat the days had
“kind of blurred together.”
She estimated that she

drank the equivalent of,

three or four cases over the
course of the week.

“I was drunk every
night,” Pogue said. “But

Ann .

that’s not the best part of
it. lIt’sl just getting a tan,
hanging out with your
friends and stuff like that.
One last fling before you
graduate and go your sepa-
rate ways.”

Malarkey, a political sci-
ence major, found the trip
better than what she was
expecting.

“The partying wasn’t out-
rageous,” Malarkey said.
“No one was breaking
things or anything like
that. We just had a good
time.”

Daniels, who is a
Resident Assistant and also
majors in political science,
said Spring Break was
“everything I thought it
would be. It had the funky
contests, just like every-
thing you see in the
papers. It had all that
stuff.”

An illness, which affect-
ed many students on the
trip, caught up with
Daniels late in the week.

Baumgartner, who is also
an RA, is friends with
Daniels and was invited
along to complete the four-
some. In the nursing pro-
gram, she found it “really

Get free eye exoz ms
forjust can/medfooa,’

By Frank Porco
Staﬂ’ Writer

People are receiving eye exami-
nations for peanuts —— literally.

The Squirrel Hill Eyetique, locat-
ed at 2242 Murray Ave., is oﬂfering
eye examinations in exchange for a
can or box of non-perishable food.
The food will be donated to the
Greater Pittsburgh Community
Food Bank which will distribute it
to the needy in the Pittsburgh area.

Dr. Ellen Lebow conducts the
eye exams, which cover the gener-
al health of the eyes, visual acuity
and cataract and glaucoma testing.

According to Norman Childs,
owner of the Squinel Hill Eyetique,
the special promotion provides
people with the opportunity to do
something important for their eyes
and help the needy at the same
time.

‘‘I just realized that there are peo-
ple who haven’t had eye exams in
so long,” he said. “We had a lady in
here the other day who hasn’t had
her eyes checked in 15 years. All it
costs is a can of food, you really
can’t pass it up.”

 Response to the offer has been
1 good, but there are a lot of people
who are skeptical‘and want to
know if there is some other obliga-
K tion to the offer, Chilcls said.

“We get in here at 9 21.111. and the
phones are ringing off the hook, it’s
wild. A lot of the phone calls are
people who want to know what

the catch is, but there is none. They

just have to bring in their can, that’s '

it,” he said.

More than 150 people are
booked to receive eye exams.
Childs said he expects to book
another 100 people before the offer
ends on April 16.

Maria Brusco, who does not reg-
ularly go to the Squirrel Hill
Eyetique for eye examinations,
exchanged four cans of peaches
for an eye exam.

“It was a good exam,” she said. “I
felt the doctor spent an adequate
amount of time on me. I might
bring my children here to get a free
examination, after all,‘it is for a
good cause.”

Krista Berk, fooddrive organizer
at the Greater Pittsburgh Food
Bank, said the group decided to do
the food drive with the Squirrel Hill
Eyetique after being contacted by
an advertising agency about the
idea.

 helped them out with the
publicity for this,” she said. “We
also send people to pick up the
food but they are doing the rest of
the work.”

The Greater Pittsburgh Food
Bank is expecting to receive 500
pounds of food from Squirrel Hill
Eyetique.

According to Berk, 36 percent of
food received by the Greater
Pittsburgh Food Bank is from a
combination of food drives and
distributions from manufacttuers.

  

Pitt is the key for a student's
desire to own piece of the sky

By Judith A. Friedl
For The Pitt News

Karen Golebieski’s ambi-
tions are soaring —— in fact,
they’re lighter than air. She
wants to own her own hot air
balloon.

The 29-year-old woman is
back at Pitt to finish her edu-
cation after taking time off to
work as a crew chief for the
I.C. Light and MAC hot air
balloons.

Golebieski is pulling
together credits she acquired
during a decade of on-again,
off-again attendance at vari-
ous Pittsburgh-area colleges.
She has not yet declared her
major, but she will probably
choose liberal studies with
clusters in psychology, com-
munications and English writ-
ing or communications and a
minor in psychology.

She said she wants to get an
internship at the Carnegie
Science Center weather
department or in a television
station weather department
— somewhere where bal-

looning and weather can be
mixed — and to continue to
fly balloons.

Golebieski isn’t fazed by
the length of time it is taking
her to achieve her degree.
She recommends looking
around and trying new expe-
riences.

“Take advantage of life
while it's here and while
you’re young,” she says.
“Attend clubs and organiza-
tions; try new things.”

Always athletic and out-
doors-oriented, Golebieski
began studying ballet at the
age of 6 at the Pittsburgh

Playhouse, then went on to

study at Point Park College. Ill
health forced her to give it up
at age 13.

In 1981, she attended Penn
State at New Kensington but
had to drop out again for
health reasons. She began
again at Community College
of Allegheny. County in the
‘83-’8-4 school year, taking
psychology courses.
Transferring her psychology
credits to Pitt in the fall of

1985, Golebieski took what-
ever classes looked interest-
ing but with no particular aim
or direction.

One Friday afternoon,
Golebieski was in class when
a fellow student mentioned
he was going skydiving the
next day. Since skydiving was
something she had always
wanted to try she went with
the group. It was the start of
what she describes as “many
wonderful hours in the air.”

Golebieski joined the Pitt
Outdoors Club, later becom-
ing vice president and run-
ning the skydiving outings.

On one outing, she met a
balloon pilot who hired her
as a member of his crew. She
started working and taking
classes part time, then left
school again to become crew
chief.

The crew chief is the pilot’s
second in command and usu-
ally works with a crew of two
or three people. The crew
chiefs duties include check-
ing the weather to help select

good to get from school, away from the
city."

The four spent days basking on the beach
and the deck of the hotel and nights trying
out the various nightclubs and bars in the
area, some as far as three miles away.

"There were so many places to go,”
Malarkey said. “I didn’t think that this place
was that big, but it was huge.”

On one night, on the way to a bar called
Harpoon Harry"s, some 20 or so cars
beeped and hollered at the group. '

“Spring break is just a complete meat
market,” Pogue said. “If you want to get
laid, if you want sex, whatever you want,
you can have. It’s just a matter of how
much you want to put into it.”

Daniels agreed. “The guys are so forward
because they have an excuse to be forward
because they’re drunk all the time. It gets
old after a while.”

Baumgartner told a story of meeting a

guy on the second night. The two of them
walked on the beach at night with a full
moon above. “It was really romantic,” she
said. However, the romance ended soon
after. “He dissed me for some girl with big
t-ts. I’ll get over it. I met a lot of guys but I
wanted to hook up, really.”

The others weren’t looking for any
romance. Malarkey said at the end of the
week that she missed her boyfriend. But
she called him only once during the trip.

“\X/e’re used to summers apart,” Malarkey
said. “It’s too expensive. We don’t need to
talk every day.

All four had no regrets about the trip.

“There’s an amusement park, a grey-
hound racing track,” Daniels said.  kind
of planned on doing that stuff. But we
didn’t have to end up doing it because it
was so nice. We just hung out by the pool
and on the beach.”

“I think it was a great trip,” Malarkey
said. “I have no complaints.”

assemble and inflate the
balloon and chasing the
balloon from takeoff to
landing. Based on vari-
ables such as air tempera-
ture, passenger load and
wind velocity, the balloon
can fly anywhere from
one to 40 miles in one
hour. The flight ends with
deflating and packing
away the balloon, which
can weigh as much as 400

Golebieski got her own
pilot’s license in Arizona
in 1991, then returned to
Pittsburgh to work as
crew chief with the MAC
balloon.

In the fall of ‘91 she
returned to Pitt part time,
then decidedlto finish
getting her degree full
time.

Golebieski says there
are advantages and disad-
vantages to being a non-
traditional age student.

“Sometimes I feel
younger people have an
advantage ——- they’re
more prepared for what’s
expected of them [in
classl,” she says. But the
tradeoff is that, “I can be
more realistic. I’d like to
see more application in
classes” with less empha-
sis on pure theory.

Welfare overhaul

Two weeks after President Clinton took the oath of olfrce he had a meet-
ing with the nation’s govemors. The topic was welfare reform, and the mes-
sage conﬁmred Clinton’s promise that he was indeed a “new Democrat.”

In that speech, Clinton talked of responsibility. He said that no longer will
people be able to leech off of the American public. Two years of general
assistance and recipients would no longer receive their welfare checks. .

He promised more incentive for people to work because under the cur-
rent system idleness is encouraged Most individuals receive more money
on welfare than they would if they worked Along with the “two-year plan,”

getting tough on deadbeat fathers and programs for education and training»

are the core elements of his proposal.

But well into the the honeymoon period, were. wondering where that
new Democrat is, and, most importantly, where is his plan? At the meeting
on Feb. 2, the president swore that in two weeks a task force would be
formed to investigrte the inefficiencies plaguing the nation’s welfare system.

Yet, 42 days later, no task force has been created. It is true that many of
the expected appointees have already been meeting for weeks, but until the
task force can discuss a concrete plan with Clinton and Secretary of Health
and Human Services Donna Shalala, talks of overhaul are premature.

Reform will be difficult. Clinton and Shalala are on opposite ends of the

spectrum. Clinton is holding steadfast to his proposals. Shalala is worried

about the consequences it will have. '

Workfare instead of welfare is a good idea. But Clinton must be careful
not to divert costs associated with the old program and shift them else-
where. He has to cut them. Even with the training, what happens to moth-
ers who have multiple children and cannot get private sector jobs? Will the
government be forced to create jobs through public work programs?

While public work programs and investment decisions are good ideas in
the short r_un, welfare reform is a long-term question. Jobs cannot be created
indeﬁnitely by simply spending more, and reform can not be sustained.

As 30 percent of the women who receive welfare do so for eight years,
drastic reform is necessary. Talk of tax credits for working mothers is a good
start. The problem, however, is a dilﬁcult one; and the “move it or loose it”
idea may not be worth all the hype Clinton is giving it. ,

Security for everyone

For over three months now the Graduate and Professional Student
Association has been fighting a $30 security fee which goes mostly to the
 campus shuttle system. '

Recent statistics show that less than 3 percent of graduate students use the

- shuttles which run through the entire Oakland area. GPSA’s main beef is the

fact that all students pay the fee whether or not the shuttle covers the area
they live in.

GPSA President Steve Parks has been actively involved. He has written
letters“ and scheduled meetings with Pitts administrators with the hope of
getting the additional fee removed. Parks said that GPSA is even willing to
go so far to lobby state Rep. Ronald Cowell to get this fee declared null and
void.

The sectuity fee works along the same line as the computer fee that every
student pays. Every student pays over $100 for a fairly good computer cen-
ter and very few students use it to their full advantage. It’s called a public
good.

Parks’ suggestion that those graduate students who wish to use the sys-
tem should buy an ID sticker that will operate as a shuttle pass has some
serious ﬂaws. First of all, the fee is a security fee and not a shuttle fee. The
rest of this money will be used for more lighting and an escort service. This
is something that graduate students who study late at the library will beneﬁt
from — no matter where they live. _

Secondly, many undergraduate students commute to Pitt as well. If stu-
dents were able to choose where there money was allocated then Pitt
would have to increase its bureaucracy. If Parks thinks that the $30 is expen-
sive, then he should wait to see what kind of costs a “pick and choose” sys-
tem would result in.

Cultural center will raise awareness

A tremendous amount of
attention has been paid to the
need to revamp the -campus
environment so it reflects the
diverse multi-ethnic, multira-
cial, and multicultural popula-
tion we have here at the
University of Pittsburgh. Many
questions have been raised
with respect to terms and defi-

nitions regarding multiculturalg

rsm.

In understanding the concept
of multiculturalism, one must
understand the social context

from which the term emerged-

and the importance of the sub-
jective in our cognitive
processes. The first process is
the intra-individual (inside the
individual) with interaction
between the conscious and
unconscious. The second is the
process of inter-individual
(between two individuals) on
conscious and unconscious
levels.

Intra-individual refers to the
Freudian notion of cornpart—
mentalization — life between
what one knows consciously
and what one has never man-
aged to raise to a level of con-
sciousness.

inter-individual unconscious-
ness pertains to that which is
under your social world view
(i.e. principles structuring one’s
world view).

Society may embrace cultural
pluralism as a value yet at the
same time create institutions
which deny it. For example, on
a conscious level an individual
may state that, “I support the
right of every ethnic group to

' participate.” Yet, unconscious-

ly, they may mean, “As long as
they do it my way — like me.”

The same individual may be
unconscious to his/her feelings
of inferiority. What would hap-
pen to his/her own sense of
self if the ethnically different
were to be accepted?

On the inter-individual level,
members of the dominant
group are likely not to know
what the “other” culture is like
except on a superficial and/or

mythical level (i.e. based on
the understanding and percep-
tion that their own culture’s
conceptual system allows).

Therefore, it is very easy for
the dominant group, in its
selection of additional mem-.
bers, to pick minority members
who share a belief system.
Thus, the status quo is re-
emphasized, and only superfi-
cial changes occur. Although
Africans, womenfand Latino’
individuals become a part of
the dominant structure, only
those who think and see the
world in the same manner as
the dominant group are afford-
ed opportunities.

Depending on the social con-
text (i.e. cultural world view)
from which multiculturalism is

Keith
Davis

defined, the actions of the
group may be counterproduc-
tive in the ultimate attempts
toward: (1) taking risk in con-
fronting untruths; (2) a readi-
ness to actively engage in the
transformation of the campus
environment; and (3) providing
students with the proper
forums —fostering a respect
and appreciation for differ-
ences and a positive valuing of
such differences.

Each individual participates
in a particular world view or
philosophical bend. It is this
conceptual system that shapes
the way we see the world (and
the people within it). One such
philosophical bend is the
Eurocentric Worldview, which
embraces the acquisition of
objects. External knowledge is
considered to be the origin of
all knowledge.

The Eurocentric Worldview
is dichotomous (either/or), and
the process to achieving it is
technology. The criteria for
self—worth and identity are
external (what one owns, how
one looks, prestige). These

assumptions are the origins of
racism and are not the best to
achieve harmonious interper-
sonal relations and/or cultural
understanding. Yet,‘ this does
not mean that any person born
of European descent is racist.
However, anyone immersing
themselves into the conceptual
system of the Eurocentric
Worldview is at risk of its con-
sequences.

Evermore, this does not
mean that individuals of other
ethnic, racial and cultural back-
grounds are exempt from par-
ticipating in such a conceptual
system. For example, the emer-
gence of the American culture
is nothing more than a
Eurocentric Worldview in
which individuals from various
ethnic, racial and cultural back-
grounds participate — due to
the social context (Eurocentric)
of the American culture.

Afrocentricity places one’s
culture and moral beliefs at the
center of his/her thought
processes. Afrocentricity does
not pose a threat to multicultur-
alism; it does, lrowever‘, pose a
threat to the aspects of
Eurocentrism that dehumanize
the experiences of others.
Clearly, "Afrocentricity does not
seek to replace Eurocentrism.
The wonderful thing about
Afrocentricity is that it does not
deny others their places in
humanity. It emphasizes the
peaceful coexistence of an
endless number of cultures. E

Hence, the two buzzwords
Afrocentrism and multicultural-
ism are both comprised of
enough political jargon to start
war.

But, we must begin to exam-
ine these paradigms closely,
such that substantive outcomes
and/or positive steps are made
toward eradicating the concep-
tual systems that hinder us
from understanding, respect-ing
and valuing each other’s cul-
ture.

THE PI’IT NEWS, Thursday March 18, 1993

What are ”traaitional” values anyway?

College Republicans

Being the head of a student
organization has proven to be
more difficult than I initiallay
thought. As its leader, I want to
see the University Democrats
become a large and influential
group on this campus. To reach
this goal, a lot of time, energy
and planning has been put into
building the organizational
framework of the UDs. One

I means of finding out what can

work for us has been to observe
how other groups have done
things.

With this in mind, I recently,

attended a College Republicans
meeting. After all, outside of the
sharp ideological differences,
they’re the group that most
closely resembles ours. And I
must say, I picked a fine meet-
ing to attend.

The Feb. 22 meetingof the

‘College Republicans centered

on the issue of gays in the mili-
tary. Judging from the sizeable
crowd, it seemed self-evident
that concentrating on controver-
sial “hot-button” issues was a
sure—frre way of drawing a good
crowd and media attention.
Lesson number one had already
been learned by yours truly. As

Bill Clinton took an enormous
risk by raising the issue of gays
in the military so early in his
presidency. A recent poll by Ybe
New Yorle Times and CBS News
reveals division among the
American public on the issue of
gay and lesbian rights. Ballot
issues in Oregon and Colorado
last fall demonstrate the orga-
nizing ability of anti-gay politi-
cal forces. Some took his deci-
sion as a sign that Clinton, the
consummate hedger of bets, is
capable of making a political
miscalculation. I saw, instead, a
few signs that Clinton is capable
of being a real leader after all.

The president is undoubtedly
receiving a lot of well—meaning
advice from his handlers to dis-
tance himself from the gay and
lesbian community in order to

. preserve his reputation as a

moderate.

I hope he ignores all the
warnings and continues! to
openly promote the rights of
gays and lesbians with all the
authority and prestige of the
Oval Office. America cannot
afford to deny positio_ns of lead-
ership to gifted, capable people

’ on the basis of their sexual ori-

entation. Nor can we ask gays
and lesbians to “play along”
with our prejudice, to keep
quiet about who they are or
who they love so that we can
preserve an outmoded defini-
tion of appropriate sexual
behavior.

Is this another shrill attack on

‘ “traditional.values” by an out-

of-the—mainstream college pro-
fessor? Not really. I consider
myself a proponent of many
“traditional” values. I was raised
by Republican parents on a
Minnesota family farm. I am the
happily married father of two
small children. I vote in every
election, value hard work and
promote the virtues of educa-
tion and public service. I am an
elder at East Liberty

the meeting was called to order,
my Republican counterpart
stood up and made some brief
opening remarks. He then
launched into a self-righteous
whine—fest about the evils of
political correctness. As the vio-
lins began to play softly in the
background (to the tune of “The
Battle Hymn of the Republic,” if
I remember correctly), the CR
president chided those who
hated free speech.

With more than just a hint of
anger in his voice, he scolded
those who tore down CR ﬂyers.
Turning a blind eye to the sins
of his own members, the presi-
dent’s harsh words were only
meant for outsiders such as
myself.

Then the fun began in
earnest. David McMullin, a
Korean War veteran and admin-
istrator at Soldiers and Sailors
Hall began to speak on the
issue of allowing gay into the
military. It was already tense

when he began his initial argu—_

ment that allowing‘ gays into the
military was impractical. Shortly

. after the question and answer

session began, Mr. McMullin
asserted that homosexuality was

Presbyterian Church where my
family worships each week. For
me, a wild Friday night might
include a movie, a couple of
beers, a good book or a rousing
game of Scrabble. So why am I
so eager to promote the rights
of gays and lesbians?

First, the description I just
gave of myself could easily be
applied to many gays and les-
bians. The old, vindictive
stereotype of homosexual
promiscuity is slowly giving
way to a realistic view of gays

Ripley
and lesbians as loving partners,
nurturing parents, skilled pro-
fessionals and often devout
people of faith. A few have
even “come out of the closet”
and confessed to being
Republicans. At the risk of
sounding cliche, some of my
best friends, students and col-
leagues are gay or lesbian. The
claim that you “don’t know any
gays or lesbians” is undoubtedly
wrong. It may be the case, how-
ever, that the gays and lesbians
in your life have resigned them-
selves to silence because of a
climate of hatred, violence and
intolerance directed against
them. I am no longer willing to
contribute to that climate with
my words and actions, or with

my silence and inaction.

Second, denying the rights of
gays and lesbians hurts all of us.
America has reached the end of
the 20th century with a score of
glaring social problems and a
diminished public commitment
to the common good. Our
country needs to reward rather
than admonish people who
have brains, energy and a zeal
for public service. We need to
open the leadership positions of

began to degenerate into a
shouting match. Members of
BiGALA and CMUout respond-
ed to Mr. McMullin’s assertion
with their own countercharges.
After about five questions, it
was clear that discussing the
issue in a calm, mature manner
was out of the question. It was
at this point that the CR presi-
dent ended the Q&A session

Shawn
  McC1earn

and the meeting. V

As ‘unpleasant as the whole
affair was, it was still a reward-
ing experience. As the following
list amply demonstrates, I did
indeed leam a lot from the CRS.

When making a point, don’t
use facts. Use alarmist rhetoric

and innuendo instead. For

example, make snotty asides
about what a weenie President
Clinton is. While such state-
ments aren’t relatedto the issue
at hand, they generally reinforce

.our most powerful institutions

-’—. military command posts,
church pulpits, corporate board
rooms, network anchor desks,
govermnent ofﬁces and univer-
sity presidencies —— to people
with extraordinary talent and
ability without regard to sexual
orientation.

The current debate about
gays in the military demon-
strates the self—defeating nature
of institutional discrimination.
Anybody willing to endure the
rigors and risks of military life in
the name of public service
deserves nothing but praise and
gratitude.

Furthermore, the person with
enough guts and integrity to
say, “I refuse to lie about my
sexual orientation just to keep
my job” is, of course, exactly the
kind of person we need. When
will we stop robbing ourselves
of the leadership potential
offered by these talented peo-
ple? .

Those of us who are defined
as “straight” by society need to
gather our courage, find our
voices and speak out against
personal and institutional dis-
crimination toward gays and
lesbians. It is not our place to
coddle bigots, to counsel
patience or to engage in elabo-
rate rationalizations when it
comes to the question of funda-
mental civil rights for gays and
lesbians. _

We need to make certain that
in America any person can walk
proudly through the front door
of any institution on the basis of
character and merit without
being asked to apologize for
something as central as sexual
identity. In other words, we
ought to promote liberty and
justice for all. How’s that for a
traditional value?

of a cause. Besides, spouting off"
is much easier than thinking.
When you’re confronted with
facts that contradict your argu-
ment, wave your arms and

shout incoherent non sequitur ’

like “Tell it to the College
Democrats!!! Tell it to the
College Democrats!!!”

Whenever possible, you
ought to bait people you don’t
like by making snide sugges-
tions. A statement to the effect,
“If you BiGALA types wanna
come next time, register
Republican!!!” (for added effect,
the prez waved a stack of voter
registration forms in the air
while he was saying this) was
made at the end of the CR meet-
ing. I couldn’t think of a better
example if I tried. ’

Wrap yourself in the ﬂag and
claim to be patriotic. After
you’ve done this, prove your
patriotism by contradicting the
Constitution and attempt to shut

agree with you.

these little gems show you how
not to run a meeting.

As for those of you who are

got one word for you: Good! If

realize that before you start
pointing fingers at anyone else,
perhaps you ought to take a
look at yourselves ﬁrst. If you’re
still offended, well, it’s like an
ROTC buddy of mine said to the
CR’s esteemed president.

El Presidente, you see, was
complaining to him about how
the meeting was disrupted by
outsiders. My friend suggested
that the president should stop
complaining and deal with such
annoyances. .

He said this in one short, sim-

with: “Suck it up!”

Roll out the barrel for Evelyn and the Polka King

By Lori M. Bossert
Staff Writer

A polka musical  I didn‘t believe it either. In fact. I thought
my editor was kidding xvlit-n he gave me the assignment. I:‘t'e/yrz
and the Po//ea Kmg, playing through March 28 at the City
Theater, is full of surprises and the biggest surprise of all is just
how good a polka musical can be. ,

I have to admit, I had a less-than—positive attitude about seeing
this show. To me, polka music meant a blaring accordion and the
overly-long company picnics of my childhood. But the musicians
featured in the musical changed my mind about polka.

The show opens with a single accordion player taking his seat
on the bandstand. He smiles, takes his seat, and goes right into
the kind of music I was dreading. Steeling myself for a long night,
I hoped I at least liked the script. But then, six more musicians
entered. They tuned up and launched into what I can only
describe as ‘electric polka. It had a jazzy feel and an infectious
beat, and it didn’t quit until the show’s end. Music underscores
every beat of this show, blending the energy of the actors with
that of the band into a tender, funny play.

Henry Czerniak (Tom Ligon) is in trouble. Once known as “The
Polka King,” he is a recovering alcoholic who sleepwalks. He
remembers little, if anything, of his adult life. But something is
bothering him, and he will have to face it.

Evelyn Starkweather (Tamara Baron) is also in trouble. In one
night, she has found out that her wealthy father has embezzled
billions from his bank and that she is adopted. Wliat else do
these Very dissimilar people have in common? Much to Evelyn’s
dismay, Czerniak is her natural father.

The rest of the play follows the odyssey of this unlikely couple
as they search for Wamla, F.velyn’s natural mother. Their search
would be easier if Czerniak could remember even the slightest
detail about her, apart from the fact that she lived in a place
called Kraut Valley. As he explains to a frustrated Evelyn: “Look,
kid, I quit drinking three months ago. I’m coming off a 25-year
long blackout!”

The story of how father and daughter grow to know, accept
and love each other narrowly misses being overly sweet. It’s
saved snappy one-liners and the exaggerated situations father
and daughter encounter. Czernial<’s failing memory is jogged by
the oddest things —— most notably the Polish phrase for “give me
a beer.” Playwright john Olive has managed to mix these
extremely funny situations with real tenderness. Perhaps the best
of these moments takes place on a rooftop. Czerniak has wan-
dered out on a roof while sleepwalking. The fiery Evelyn grasps
his ankles, .wakes him and screeches “Wheres Wanda?” Horrified,
Czerniak still cannot answer her. But he softly remarks: “She
thinks about you every day  I know I would have, ifI had

Living Colour
Stain
Sony/ Epic Records

“779e dog that chases its tail will
be bu$_)i”

- Vernon Reid and Doug
Wimbis/9

Don't try to classify them.

Don’t try to group them.

Don’t try to ﬁgure them out -
you have no chance.

After a three-year hiatus, Living
Colour is back with its third studio

' release, Stain, and a new single,

“Leave It Alone."
The group has chased a new
sound —- a rougher and more

’ powerful sound — and has come

up aces.

“It’s a fatter sound, a harder
sound,” lead guitarist Vernon
Reid said.

“If you’re thinking of having a
long career in this business you’re
going to have ups and you’re
going to have downs and you’re
going to have sideways,”
Wimbish said. “This record really
stands on its own, and it fits in

with the other two records.”

Stain is a severe departure from
the group’s two previous releases,
Vivid and Time’s up On previous
releases Living Colour didn’t give
a rest from the music —— nothing
was overly strong and there were
several slow, mellow tunes.

But on its new release virtually
every song hits you square
between the eyes. Reid and lead
singer Corey Glover maneuver
brilliantly between their two crafts
— guitar and vocals — and leave
a feeling of unrest in the soul.

Fortunately, the new disc hits
right on target, with 12 new cuts
of hard-edged funk. While
approaching the most blatantly
hard music that the group has
ever produced, Living Colour
augments it with dazzling effects
and melodies, some of which are
brand new to even the band
itself.

Stain is the band’s first project
since the departure of bassist
Muzz Skillings. Vaguely defining
his reasons for leaving, Skillings
left a void in the band that was
only empty for a short time.

 

EVOLUTION

 

To PAT TRAN s‘lT. ..

- EAT IN OR TAKE om-

ACCORDING

“It’s hard  put my finger on

why Muzz left,” lead guitarist
Vernon Reid said in an interview
with Guitar World. “Anyone who
has gone through a divorce
knows that there are probably as
many reasons as there are stars in
the sky.”

Nothing is lost, however, as
Doug Wimbish, formerly with
Mick Jagger, Tackhead and the
Sugarhill Gang, picks up
admirably with strong and imagi-
native basslines to provide foun-
dation for lead guitarist Vernon
Reid’s brilliant licks.

“His lines are almost like musi-
cal tapestries,” Reid said. “He has
the ability to make you believe
that a line is continuing while he’s
going on to play something else.
It’s quite ingenious.

“Doug brings about a certain
kind of directness and a lot of dif-
ferent techniques, as far as he
deals with his instrument.”

Lead singer and writer Corey
Glover, now with a slightly
sheared head, is in his best form
since “Open Letter To A
Landlord,” mixing in an angry,
harsh voice with what is some-
times strikingly sedate yet intense.

William Calhoun retums as the
band’s drummer, pounding out
steady, sometimes startlingly
obtuse beats below the whole
scene. The four combine to
release an incredibly strong musi-
cal aura.

The theme of Stain involves 15
interwoven songs that, together,
represent a personal blemish that

A gnaws at   psyche.

“You think of something like a
stain, something that stains you,”
Reid said. “It has a kind of mass,
in effect — you can’t get it out,
you can’t get it out of your sys-
tem.”

The disc’s case, a tinted red
package with the band peering
out from beneath the disk, pro-
vides a fitting package for the
contents.

The band wastes no time with
its new material. “Go A\\';iy,"’
written by all four members,
explodes with a pounding Reid
guitar riff over Wimbish’s bass.
Glover screeches out internally
interrogative lyrics — a plead for
self-peace: ‘

“I see the starving Africans on
TV/ I feel it has nothing to do
with me/ I sent my $20 to Live
Aid/ I paid my empty conscience
to go away.”

The song is like nothing the
band has ever done before. At
times nearing a sort of heavy
metal, “Go Away” explodes from
the speakers with a definitive
sound and a sense of self-pain
and doubt.

“What is the point of suffering/
what is the purpose of joy,”
Glover  “A lifetime spent
for a dollar/ a lifetime spent twist-
ing in pain.”

Nothing on the disk matches
the opening song for sheer
power. "This Little Pig” also hits
very hard but does not capture
the same lyrical intensity.

the press. Instead of responding
to rumors and gossip with deci-
bel,-busting profanity (see Guns
N’ Roses: “Use Your Illusion II” —
“Get In The Ring”), Living Colour
maneuvers around disputes with
the press in a refreshingly calm
sense.

“Gossip buzzes around your

head like bees in a hive/ some- V

times I think that’s how you stay
alive/ Don’t you hate it when
those little facts interrupt/ So
much more fun just to make it all
up.”

The pace of the songs slides
from slow to extremely fast, with
Reid continuously repeating a
four-note riff in the chorus. It
erupts in an angry Glover tirade:

“Why don’t you mind your
own business/ And leave mine
alone.”

It dissolves into the words of an
Indian man, whose soliloquy
leads right into “Leave It Alone,”
the group’s first release off the
album.

“We must never take these
words too seriously,” the man
says. ‘_‘\X/ords are very important,
but if we take them too seriously
we destroy everything.”

“There’s no place I’m going to/
It’s the hole I’ve dug,” Glover
sings in “Leave It Alone.” “I’m not
down with this one/ and that one,
they’re much too serious/ I don’t
plan to make this a career.”

Reid’s guitar shrieks with angry
violence that compliments
Glovefs lyrics tremendously.

“We always talk about peace/
But peace is not defrned/ Tell me
what’s with all this tension/ Tell
me what we’re gonna find.”

“Bi,” one of the few mellow
songs, follows “Leave It Alone,”
providing, the first chance for a
rest from the ferocity of the music.

A song obviously about bisexu-
als, “Bi” gives the band an oppor-
tunity to speak of its opinions on
that lifestyle. The group’s parallels
with the pulls and pressures of
public life are obvious.

“I need a closet big enough to

live in/ A closet for the whole‘

world to live in.” .

There are no judgements
passed, no condemnations made.
Calhoun and Reid only dance
around the subject, without
insulting anyone practicing the
alternative lifestyle.

“My lover told me that she’s bi/
I wanted to scream, there were
tears in my eyes/ She said ‘baby,
baby, don’t you cry/ ‘cause the
one I am with you’ve been seeing
on the side.’”

“Nothingness” is the slowest
and most beautiful of Stains 13
entries. A self—escapist’s dream,
the song begins with the calm
chirps of crickets and a crash of
thunder before Reid’s haunting
guitar kicks into the lyrics describ-
ing author Calhoun’s personal
Utopia.

“Maybe there’s somewhere I
can go/Where there’s sunshine
and the wind won’t blow.”

Glovefs soft lyrics ﬂoat over a
strong backbeat provided by
Wimbish.

“Nothingness, all I have to feel
is my loneliness/Nothing in the
attic ‘cept an empty chest/And
nothing lasts forever...”

Mad Dog and Glory. all talnt, n sc-rit

Crime giy author and Academy
Award nominee Richard Price had
just enough cop inspiration after
researching Sea Qflote to squeeze
out Mad Dog and Glory and then
enlist grade-A talent and status to

assist in silver screendom. He got -

the help of the Martin
Scr)rsese/liarbara T)eFina, the
Ttalian-American/gangster‘ produc-
tion team. He got john
McNaughton, director of the criti-
cally acclaimed character—peel,
Henzy,-[’(nr1raz‘t (J A .S'er1'a/Ktl/er. He
got method—rnan Robert De Niro to
lead. He got Uma Thurman’s
breasts and Bill Mun‘ay’s Chicago
smarts. But what he actually ended
up with was his script, chock—full
of bland characters and diluted
quirk, spiced with some sort of
undercooked twist on surface traits
and a few neat production licks.
Underused talent starts with De
Niro, who plays the basically non-
descript everyday guy, ironically
tagged Mad Dog (a.k.a. Wayne,
the Chicago homicide portraiter‘).
In the midst of plain—guy/no-
female stagnation, he saves wise-
guy Frank Milo’s (Bill Murray)
head from lead. Enter a  and
uncomplicated bond between
moral and immoral. Milo, the
prophetic mobster (“I am the expe-
ditor of your dreains,” he tells Mad
Dog), is one of the only interesting
and well-acted characters in the
film. Murray doesn’t shake the
“Saturday Night Live” lounge act
schtick until the last few minutes.

Gangster Frank Milo

. 

 

(Bill Murray) warns his unlikely friend,

police officer Wayne Dobie (Robert De Niro), about love.

Milo shows his gratitude by
sending sob-story Glory (stiffly
acted by the perpetually naked,
Uma Thurman) to Mad Dog’s
apartment for a week of —— what-
ever.

‘Tin no wanior, no hero,” Mad
Dog tells Glory. But y’see, we
already have the bustin’ outta
blandness scenario with the life-
saving antics (it’s the first time Mad
Dog brandishes his grin in 15
years), and now we got the shell-
breaking, jean-crearning woman.
In the beginning of the 97-minute
film, we see meek—’n’-mild Wayne
sleeping in a fetal position, and by
the middle, he’s shed his clothes
and is a missionary (position). Mad
Dog in a Glory sandwich. Now
he’s got his chick and an ensuing

self—redemption fight scene with
Milo.

Price stocks up on stereotypical
stock supporters: Wayne’s crass
partner/pal, Mike (David Caruso)
and Milo’s milk—guzzling idiot
savant henchman, Harold
(Gooafellas gangster Mike Starr).
He creates a stale but melodramat-
ic script for a digestable
Hollywood and then has
McNau.glrton thread it like a crazy
offbeat juxtaposition of decent and
dreg. Night scenes and crisp
images stand out from the light
humor (a mobster who consults a
therapist’? Who’d’ve thought?) and
tastelessness of the love fable.

Kramer
The Guilt Trip
Shimmy—Disc

Kramer has pulled off quite a
feat with his latest album. Yhe
Guilt 'l'r1‘p not only contains 36
songs, covering six album sides,
it also remains consistent for the
most part from beginning to end.

For over a decade Kramer has
played organ and bass in several
bands like rock deconstruction-
ists Shockabilly and liongwater,
wherein he and performance.
artist Ann Magnuson combined
black humor and psychedelic
pop.

Although Kramer has collabo-
rated with other artists and
appeared as a sideman on sever-
al Shimmy LPs, The Guilt Trip
marks his first solo release. It also
brings all of his musical styles
together under one roof, from
pop music to experimental art
rock.

The opening “Overture”
sounds like “Sergeant Peppers
Lonely Hearts Club Band” if the
Beatles played the songs intro-
duction into infinity. At foru‘ rnin—
utes it could have used some
editing, but the layers of guitars
weave in and out of each other
and keep your attention. When

the song finally finishes, it
remains wedged between your
eardnuns for l1OLll‘S.

The eerie keyboard—driven
sound of “The Seven Sei’/.ures“
recalls Pink Floyd’s early psych
period when the band recorded
soundtracks for Furopean art
films. The song drones on hyp-
notically, also sounding like the
incidental music to a movie. In
fact, it might be just that since the
cover mentions a film as a “work
in progress." 1

On his past recordings.
Kiarrrers production techniques
and musical skill overshadowed
his songwriting technique. But
The Guilt 'l‘rz‘p plays up his
knack for catchy melodies and
harmonies, reminiscent of ‘60s
pop. His fragile voice recalls
icons from that decade like
folkie Tim Buckley or Floyd’s
Syd Barrett.

On many of the songs Kramer
sings the melody, adds a hamio
ny vocal and sings the melody in
a higher voice on top of it. The
layering makes the vocals sound
thicker. A comparison to the
Beatles could be made once
again, but Kramer's music winds
up sounding a lot more twisted
than a_rryth.ing the Fab Four ever

Continued from page S-2

Also included on the album is a
song entitled “Auslander,” a story
of one man’s existence in a for-
eign and hostile land; “l’ostman,"
a hard-riding tune similar to “Go
Away” and “\‘(/TFF,” an instru-
mentally dance-flavored song,
which only expands on the
band’s musical range.

“Hemp” is a very intriguing
entry. Written and performed by
Andrew Fairley, the song is noth-
ing more than a poem read over
computerized music.

“So many times I’ve touched
you, reached you, teased you/
Now fingering these veins of
lremp/ ...how quickly and gently
you will sleep.”

The disk ends with “Wall,” a
“warning” to the human race,
enjoining it to tear‘ down the bar-
riers of race, religion and ethnici-
ty that separate us all.

“We hate each other ‘cause
that’s what our parents taught
us/We hate each other for no rea-
son at all/"Hie wall between us all
must fall.”

Whether or not the groove on
this disk is what Living Colour
seeks is yet to be seen. Slightly
harder, it gives an edge that
could lead either into basic hard
rock or it could launch the band
back into the funk which
emanated from the previous two
albums.

No matter the direction, rest
assured that the dog will contin-
ue to chase its tail.

known about you.”

Ligon and Baron shine in
the principle roles. Ligon’s
Czerniak is a gentle, love-
able man who makes it
impossible not to like him
—— even when admitting that
he slept with a different girl
in every town. His character
slowly gathers the courage
to face his past and live with
his mistakes in a transforma-
tion which begins with his
very first entrance. He
works the audience like he’s
been singing polka all his
life — all in all, a stunning
performance.

Baron matches Ligon as
the spunky heroine, Evelyn.
She mixes the no-nonsense
impatience of irer character
with a real vulnerability that
can be very touching. Her
vocals are strong and mov-
ing, particularly on her
haunting “Where Do I Go

.bedecked

From Here?” She and Ligon
work very well together,

. with a good onstage rapport

and perfect comic timing.
This piece wouldn’t be
complete without a mention
of Kelly Buzalka, who plays
everything from a conserva-
tive lawyer to a crystal-
hypnotist.
Buzalka can do anything in
this show. She gives both
caricatures and characters
with an uncommon excel-
lence and manages to give
six different, believable
characters without a heart-
beat between the transi-
tions. I hope to see her in
more shows in Pittsburgh.

released. On “I’m Your Fan” he
speeds the vocals up, making them
sound like he inhaled helium.

Former Bongwater members
David Iicht (drums) and Randolph
A. Hudson III (guitars) provide
solid backing on most of the songs.
While half of the songs are instru-
mental, the playing, and some
trademark Kramer tape effects, fill
in the gaps. “My Friend Daniel” is a
driving surf rock tune where
Hudson runs all over his guitar.

By employing his answering
machine messages on “The Bosom
Friend,” Kramer lampoons music
industry moguls who try to court
musicians. A message keeps repeat-
ing during the song, “If he doesn’t
want big money from a record
company  big money from a
record company,” reinforcing the

absurdity of the statement.

But the answering machine mes-
sage on “Coda,” the final track,
brings the album to an enigmatic
and rather sad ending. Overtop a
lone organ track appears a
woman’s voice. "Your the one who
walked out,” she says. “I still want
to be your friend  that’s my choice
 call me

Kramer dedicated the album to
his wife Shannon and infant daugh-
ter Tess, so perhaps the track con-
tains a personal reference. But still,
it makes for an odd ending.

Most musicians don’t have the
creativity to write enough material
for a three-record set. Not only does
Kramer pull it off, he pulls it olf with
a great deal of skill and originality
that isn’t exhausted by the end.

PAGE 11  

By Rob Pugliese

Sports Assistant

Don’t tell Utah head coach Rick
Majerus that Pitt doesn’t belong in
the NCAA Tournament. He’s not
buying that for a second.

“I think they're very good 
They're certainly every bit as
good or better than we are and
we got a bid,” Majerus said. “I like
them better than [Texas] El Paso,
and El Paso’s beaten us twice. I
think they deserve a bid.”

Friday night at 10:35 Pitt can
demonstrate just how worthy it is
when the ninth—seeded Panthers
(17-10) meet a formidable chal-
lenge in Majerus’ Utah Utes.
Tucked away in the obscure con-
fines of Salt Lake City, Majerus
seemed unaware of the swirling
controversy clouding Pitt's tour-
ney selection.

“I don't know anything about it.
I mean were like in the land time
forgot. There’s a giant river and a
mountain range and we might as
well be in Tibet in terms of news,”
Majerus quipped. “So I don’t fol-
low it that much. I don’t really
know who is or who isn’t deserv-
ing, I don’t see the Big East that
much. It’s almost like there’s two
countries and the West is a corm-

try unto itself, especially in bas-
ketball. So I couldn’t comment
with any validity relative to who
did or who didn’t deserve a bid.”

While Majerus has seen the cur-
rent Panther squad only on ﬁlms,
he is not a complete stranger to
Pitt. Majerus coached upstart Ball
State to a 68-64 upset of the
Panthers in the first round of the
1989 NCAA Tournament. Majerus’
success at Ball State led to the
opportunity at Utah, where he has
coached the Utes to an impressive
91-23 mark in four seasons and
has cemented his reputation as
one of the game’s elite coaches.

Utah (23-6) breezed through
most of its schedule en route to
winning the regular season
Western Athletic Conference title.
The Utes rolled to a 15-3 confer-
ence mark, tying them with BYU,
but the Utes swept a pair of
games from the Cougars, winning
54-53 at Provo and 89-85 in Salt
Lake City.

Like Pitt, the Utes have slumped
of late, dropping three of their last
fo_ur games, most recently a 90-85
overtime loss to Texas El—Paso
(UTEP) in the WAC Tournament
semi-ﬁnals.

However, Utah does not
appear to be struggling. Its losses

Judgement Day

Panthers face challenge of proving themselves

at UTEP and New Mexico, two
difficult places to play, and the
WAC toumey defeat can be attrib-
uted largely to center Larry Cain’s
sprained ankle and the three-
game suspension of valuable
sixth man Darroll Wright.

And in that WAC semi-final
loss, the Utes still seemed to have
things in hand, holding an eight-
point lead with about five minutes
remaining, when Majerus picked
up a technical foul that complete-
ly swung momentum towards
UTEP.

Cain has practiced very sparing-
ly, but his ankle is improving.
According to Majerus, Cain’s
ankle is about 8() percent and
should allow him to play Friday
with an air cast. Wright has also
been reinstated, giving the Utes
scoring punch off the bench.

Utah is a well—balanced, disci-
plined team that runs a structured
offense efficiently and suffocates
opponents with a strangling man-
to-man defense. The Utes deploy
a variety of weapons on offense,
but 6—foot—9-inch power forward
Josh Grant is the center of atten-
tion.

struggled miserably for
six weeks now and has
served as a national
whipping boy for the
media this week, the Pitt
Panthers appear surpris-
ingly loose and confident
heading into their NCAA
Tournament first-round
matchup with Utah.

’ The onslaught of harsh
criticism has not spoiled
the mood of head coach
Paul Evans or his players.
If anything, they appear
to be thriving on the
whole atmosphere, defi-
antly casting aside any
negative talk and saying
they have nothing to ,
prove.

If Evans is bothered, he
is hiding it well and gen-
uinely seems amused by
the wave of criticism he
and his team have 
received. Yesterday, he '3
was firing off quips about
Utah head coach Rick
Majerus and 25-year-old
All-American forward
Josh Grant, whom Evans
said “is old enough to be
my father.”

retorted. “Here’s a guy
that’s bigger than our
whole front line.”

Evans smiled at
those who have ripped
on him, “In this city
you’re used to it. I wear
a bullet—proof vest.”

Regarding whether
Pitt deserved its NCAA
Tournament bid or not,
the Panthers had plenty
of answers for that.

“We certainly didn’t
keep Providence out. If
youlook down at the
12th and 11th seeds
that’s who kept
Providence out,” Evans
said. “A ninth seed
didn’t keep out any-

Fearless staff predicts
NCAA Tourney outcome

East Region: Hey Dam Smith, if
you don’t go to the Final Four with
this custom-made Carolina cake-
walk, shame on you. The selection
committee did the Tar Heels up just
fine; and as long as point guard
Derrick Phelps is healthy, forget it,
baby.

The other half of the bracket fea-
tures a tremendous Sweet 16 con-
frontation with sweet Nick Van Exel
and his feisty Cincy Bczrreats facing
off with Sweet Lou Roe and UMass
(John Calipari, please come back to
Pittsburgh, please). Both squads
have athletes galore. Van Exel and
UMass’ Dana Dingle make my all-
name team. The Minuteman will
wail away on the inside with Harper
Williams and Roe taking it to the
rack with reckless abandon.

Great Eight: Too much Tar Heel
size. UMass will hang tough, (a la
Mark Macon and Temple two years

ago against UNC in this game) but
Eric Montross and Carolina prevail
by five.

East Pick: Tar Heels to New
Orleans.

Midwest: Meanwhile, Indiana
got royally shafted. I’m not the
worid’s biggest Hoosier fan by any
means (just ask Brian Gallagher),
but the Hoosiers must be on the bad
side of the man upstairs with the
Devilish minefield they’ll have to
negotiate. Between Duke and
Kansas, there will be no room for
pretenders in this bracket Lucky for
Bobby Knight, “Athletes Are Us,”
also known as a dangerous
Louisville crew getting no respect,
will come along and put Indiana out
of its misery. The jayhawks roll to St.
Louis, but Duke is in “a zone” by

The Pitt News

The Pitt men’s tennis team
blew into Florida hoping to
kick off its spring season with
a bang. The team blew out
with two wins against two
tough opponents.

The final match the
Panthers played turned out to
be their best, as they edged
out Indianapolis College by
the final score of 5-4. Leading
the Panthers in the victory
was junior No. 2 seed Alex
Cobbold, who played through
a bad cold to win both his sin-
gles and doubles match.

Pitt’s top singles player,
Scott Smith, started the action
with a three-set victory in

number one singles over
Indy’s Perry Mann (7-6, 4-6, 6-
4).

Cobbold followed and
looked weary as he dropped
the first set to John Venter, 6-
0. He quickly rebounded by
winning the second set in a
tiebreaker, then sealed up the
hard-earned victory by taking
the third set, six games to
four.

“Alex was definitely a big
factor in the win, “ Pitt head
coach George Dieffanbach
said. “He played a tough
match, and the fact that he
could come away with a win
under the circumstances he
was facing  it was a definite
boost.”

Number four singles player
Jeff Campbell nailed down

Pitt’s third match victory by
defeating Indy’s Steve Klei in
straight sets (6-2, 6-3). In num-
ber six singles, David Dumpel
defeated Jarve Pheifer in
straight sets (6-4, 6-1) for the
Panthers’ fourth victory.

Pitt’s J.B. Chronister and
Effrum Garnett lost their
matches in No. 3 and 5 sin-
gles, so the Panthers held a 4-
2 lead entering the doubles
round.

Pitt’s top seeded doubles
team of Cobbold/Chronister
quickly secured thevictory for
the Panthers by defeating the
Indianapolis team of
Mann/Marc Hamm in straight
sets (6-2, 7-6).

“Indianapolis is a strong
team, and I felt it was definite-
ly our best showing over the

   

Men's tennis caps Florida trip With Win

break, “ Dieffanbach said.

The first win, a straight set
whitewashingof St. Leo’s, saw
everyone breeze through with
a victory. No. 1 seed Scott
Smith beat I.J. Esteban 6-4, 7-
6. No. 2 seed Alex Cobbold
outlasted Derrick Taylor 6-3,
7-6. James Chronister, Pitt’s
No. 3, treated St. Leo’s Jason
Horak like a landlord treats a
delinquent tenant, throwing
him out 6-2, 6-1. The bottom
three seeds also rolled, losing
a total of eight games in the
three matches.

In doubles, the duos of
Smith/Sambuchino and
Campbell/Mukherjee smacked
St. Leos in pro-set matches 8-6
and 8-1, respectively.

Pitt lost to Marquette,7-O
and Appalachian St., 9-0.

Forest in the Regional semis. (Wake
survives Acie Earl and Iowa in one

Meanwhile, Anfemee Hardaway
will close out a tremendous Career
by scoring 34 against Western
Kentucky and scaring the hell out of
everyone’s bandwagon team of the

round two. NBA teams are salivat-

but to hand the Tarheels a lubed up

the tournament. The team has a star,
a bench and can shoot the lights
out. As for Pitt, this tatm could slip
by Utah and surprise the hell out of
UK; but don’t bet on it. Stick to a
safer wager, like winning the lottery.

Southeast Pick: Kentucky

West: Will it be Michigan’ Those
over-talented, under-inspired hoop
lunatics from the land of maize blue’
Or Arizona, the best team in the
country that didn’t beat anyone?
How about Georgia Tech, always
good for an upset or two (see ACC
toumey)?

Fact is, while Arizona and
Georgia Tech — along with lovable

Vandy — seem a slight possibility to
beat the Wolverines, they won’t.
While Michigan is too big and too
talented to avoid anything less than
another trip to the Final Four, the
teams probable opponents are too
untested and to blase to take advan-
tage of Chris Webber and company
if they slip.

West Pick: Michigan

In New Orleans: As in 1991,
when Duke beat UNLY in the

the National Champion.
National Champion: Michigan
—-Brian Gaﬂagber

Let’s begin in the East regional. Did
Dean Smith die saving a family from
a ﬁre or donate a billion dollars to
charity in a past life or something?
North Carolina should walk to the
Regional Final, with only a slight
challenge with a talented but inex-
perienced Arkansas squad in the
Sweet 16.

The other regional semi-final
could feature a dynamite matchup
of Massachusetts and Cincinnati.
The UMass inside game makes the
difference against a Bearcat team
that isn’t quite what it was last year

as the Minutemen go on to take on
the Tarheels.

This is where health is a major
factor. As long as North Carolina
point guard Derrick Phelps is
healthy, and he probably is, the
Tarheels will be too much for
UMass as they roll to the final four.

East Pick: North Camlina

While Dean Smith’s crew got a
nice path to New Orleans, don‘t
expect Bobby Knight to start a fan
club for the NCAA selection com-
mittee. (Actually, can anybody see
Knight starting a fan club for any-
one? Didn’t think so.)

Instead of rewarding Knight’s
Hoosiers for being number one at
the end of the regular season, they

powers that select stuck Indiana in
the toughest region. Even without
Alan Henderson, the Hoosiers will
roll past Wright St., New Orleans
and a tough Louisville team to the
regional ﬁnal.

On the other side is a wounded
champion just getting healthy —
Duke. If Blue Devil forward Grant
Hill is anywhere near 100 percent,

Coach K’s crew will claw its way '

past Kansas into a meeting with
Indiana for entry into the ﬁnal four.

If Henderson plays, Indiana wins.
But since that is doubtful, Duke will
go on to battle ACC rival North
Carolina in New Orieans.

Midwest Pick: Duke

lot of the criticism," point guard

Jerry McCullough said. “Now I

think it’s just about having fun
and winning a couple games.

“We feel a lot of teams get
jerked out of the NCAA
Tournament each year, and this
year because of the press. They
say it was a down year for the
Big East. I feel that’s the reason,
not us. Overall I think we
proved ourselves to be an
NCAA team anybody that
don’t like it — tough.”

McCullough also had a mes-
sage for the teeth—gnashing
coming out of Providence.

“If they have something to
say, prove it to us next YQar,“
he said.

Power forward Chris McNeal
said Pitt is tuning all the static
out.

“It’s not bothering us, were
in and they're out,” McNeal
said. “If we were on the outside
looking in we’d be saying the
same thing  fortunately We’re
in and they’re at home watch-
ing us play."

McNeal might very well be
the man to matchup with
Grant, one of the nations most
dangerous players. Does that
scare him?

“They’re probably more con-
cerned about us than we are
about them," McNeal said. "It's
a good test for me. but it’s also
a good test for him, too 
checking me."

Even Pitt's pathetic shooting
woes were a cause for Evans’
humor.

“Were almost to the point
where we're gonna say, ‘hey
come down and take bad shots.
just fire them up,’ to get them
loose  I don’t know.”

That idea did not seem to
bother point guard Jerry
McCullough too much.

“I always have my confi-
dence That’s one thing I don't
think I’ll lose,” he said. “That’s
fine by me. If he’s gonna just
let us shoot, it’s no problem.
There’s no pressure on good
shots. The only thing I have to
say about that [is] as long as
everyone gets back on I) and

no one has a problem with it.
it’s fine by me.”

McCullough also relished the
thought of finally facing a’man—
to—man defense. regardless of
how stingy Utahs man—to—man
has been. The Utes have been
holding opponents to under 40
percent shooting from the
floor.

“We don't think anyone can
guard us inside or outside if
they play us man-to-man."
McCullough said. "The only
trouble we had all year was
against the zone. I think any
team that plays us man—to—man
as in UCLA and Illinois, I think
they’re gonna get beat  The
only thing that means anything
to me is they play man—to—man
and that gives us a lot of confi-
dence.” '

Even a potential second
round meeting with top seed
Kentucky didn’t faze “Ice."

“No, because Kentucky’s a
man-to-man team; and like I
said, any team that plays inan-
to—man we most definitely feel
we will beat."

THE PITT‘ NEWS, -Thursday, March-18, 192

NCAA

Continued from page 14

For any of those Pitt partisans
who think the Panthers are going
to do some damage in the tourney,
just look at the bracket. If Paul
Evans and company can find a
way past Utah, Kentucky lurks on
the Nashville horizon for the sec-
ond round.

The Wildcats will roll over Pitt
and all comers into the regional
final against Florida State. The
injury prone Seminoles will be put
out or their misery as Kentucky
gets the trip to the Big Easy.

Southeast Pick: Kentucky

Michigan powered its way to
the Final Four last year on pure tal-
ent. Despite a ye2u’s experience to
season the mix, the Wolverines

' haven’t gotten much better and are
ripe for an upset. They will find it
in the Sweet 16 against Georgia
Tech.

Forget overrated Arizona,
Vanderbilt will face off with
Georgia Tech in the Regional
Final. The Yellow Jacket roll will
continue into the Final Four.

West Pick: Georgia Tech

The Georgia Tech run will final-
ly end as it is washed away by a
stomr of Kentucky three—pointers.
Bolstered by the healthy Hill that
got them to New Orleans, Duke
frustrates North Carolina again and
goes to the ﬁnals.

In the ﬁnal, Kentuckys superior
talent and depth will overcome
Duke’s experience and heart for
the title.

National Champion: Kentucky
—Ryan Buncber

Southeast: Kentucky will come
out of the region, although Seton
Hall and Florida St. (Bob Sura has
proven that white men can indeed
jump) could" both take the
Wildcats on a good day, Keep an
eye out for Memphis St Forget Bill
Walton’s comments, Anfernee
Hardaway is the most talented
player in the country. Memphis St.
will give the Pirates (its ar-TUR—us)
a run for their money in the sec-
ond round but will fall. (Sorry
Coach Finch.)

The 12-seeded UTC Mocs could
surprise Wake Forest, but neither
will get by Acie Earl and Iowa
(Chris was a warrior and will
always be remembered). Utah
beats Pitt 84-63. (Paul, talk the
smack after the game, ‘kay?)

Southeast pick: Kentucky vs.
Seton Hall in Elite 8; UK 83,
SHU77

West: It probably tops the
NCAA in trash-talking, but
Michigan is too talented to get
knocked off in the region. Justus
Thigpen and Iowa St. will beat a
pansy UCLA team. (Jim Harrick
with a three—year extension? Better
hope that Charles O’Bannon signs
real quick.) ‘

Ifjames Forrest plays like he did
during the ACC tourney for’Ga.
Tech — Michigan still wins. Long
Beach St. will dog Illinois. The
LBS/Vandy game is intriguing.
Props go out to Billy McCaffrey —
it takes some bigtime guts to leave
that Duke program but he more
than pulled it off. Oh yeah, Jim
Rome’s fav Arizona Wildcats will

barely get by Jevon Cnrdup and
Missouri, then getbeat by Vandy.

West Pick: Michigan vs.
Vandy in Elite 8: Michigan 98,
Vandy 81

Midwest: Its become tiresome,
but without Alan Henderson
inside, its going to be very tough
for Indiana to get out of the region,
especially with Duke and Kansas
vying for the same Final Four
berth. IU will cruise past Wright
St., New Orleans and Louisville
(take Denny Crum over Eddie
Sutton in the second round) but
Duke beats them in a very good
game for the berth. Duke, by the
way, will beat a revitalized Cal and
Kansas, which have looked very
susceptible this season.

Midwest Pick: Duke vs.
Indiana in Elite Eight: Duke 76,
IU73

East: UNC’s bracket is arguably
easier than a Rick Pitino practice.
With Derrick Phelps at the point
there isn’t a better, more disci-
plined, more intimidating team in
the country. St. John’s will beat a

very young but very talented
Arkansas team (props go out to
Nolan Richardson who did a hellu-
va job in Fayetteville ). I’ll take
Manhattan (get it?) over Virginia.
Cinci will beat to New Mexico St
(sorry, Sam) and UMass (Pugs,
chill — you gotta go with Nick
Van Exel, right’).
East Pick: UNC vs. Cinci in
Elite Eight: UNC 71, Cinci 64
Final Four: UNC over Duke 79-
71. CoachKwillkeepthisteamin
the game but I like Eric Montross
over Cherokee Parks. Bobby
Hurley is pound for pound the
best player in the country —— bar
none. 4
Michigan over Kentucky 82-79.
Juwan Howard is, get this, under-
rated Chris and Jalen (Bri, get that
big bagga dope ready) are great,
but Juwan doesn't get the credit he
deserves. Tony Delk needs PT.
_I.B.’s fearless championship
pick: Despite Pugs’ bestial
remarks about Eric Montross, UNC
beats Michigan by five, 78-73.

‘I110 answer to the cut question.

Utah

Continued from page 11 .
Basleetball Times, Grant also won
his second WAC Most Valuable
"Player award this season. The
Utes’ hardworking, versatile cap-
tain averages 17.1 points on 52
percent shooting and hauls down
11 rebounds per game.

Grant is equally lethal posting
up on the low blocks as he is
popping out to drill three-pointers‘
(.426). In addition, Grant is one of
the finest free-throw shooters in
college basketball, hitting 92.2
percent on the season (95 of 103).
Quickness and outstanding pass-
ing skills round out Grant’s game,
sure to make him an NBA first-
round pick in ]une’s draft. He
needs just 43 points to eclipse the
2,000-point mark.

“He’s unselfish to a fault,”
Majerus said. “He’s just been a
pleasure to coach and the nicest
kid you’d ever want to meet.”

Grant led Utah to the NCAAs
two years ago, when the team
beat South Alabama in its opening
game and knocked off Steve
Smith-led Michigan State before
falling to UNLV in the Sweet 16
round of the Western Regional.
Grant missed the entire 1991-92
campaign with a torn patella ten-

don, but the Utes still managed 24 ,

wins and a trip to the NIT’s Final
Four.

Now Utah is back for another
NCAA run with its battle—tested
nucleus of Grant, point guard
Jimmy Soto and off guard Byron
Wilson gunning for more. Soto is‘
just 59” and might be 150 pounds
soaking wet, but Majerus
describes him as “the heart and
soul of our team.”

A Naismith Award nominee
(given to the nation’s best player
under six feet), Soto also made
first team all-WAC, averaging 13
points and 4.2 assists per contest.
He is the playrnaker, the quarter-
back for a potent offense that
averages 77 points per game on
nearly 50 percent shooting as a
team.

“He’s really quick, he’s a very

Tomorrow, Ahmad Shareef and the Panthers will be scrapping with a tournament team for

clever player. He’s a cerebral
player, obviously," Majerus said.
“He's a very good foul shooter. a
pressure player, makes good
decisions, can shoot the three.
He’s our best defender off the
ball, and he’s a good defender on
the ball.”

Majerus said Utah is the tough-
est coaching job in the country as
far as recruiting players and has
had to adapt and survive with a
very limited talent pool. But Utah
has done much more than stuyive
with its crew of castoffs. Soto, the
classic overachiever, had received
scholarship offers from just Utah
and Gonzaga, but Majerus loved
his heart and attitude and has
developed him into a dangerous
floor general.

Small forward Phil Dixon (10.1
ppg, .505 FG) is a Connecticut
castoff turned deadeye three-
point marksman, and stocky
shooting guard Wilson, another
first team all-conference per-
fonner, (12.5 ppg, 5.8 rpg) landed
in Utah after being an unwanted
Proposition 48 casualty.

It does not make for a ﬂashy,
glitzy combination, but Utah plays
together at a polished level more

talented teams cannot match.
Four of five starters hit the three-
pointer and frrst—year guard Mark
Rydalch adds another cannon off
the bench to a club that has con-
nected on 176 treys (.407). If this
contest evolves into a free-throw
shooting contest, Pitt is in trouble.
The Utes hit 79 percent as a team,
with none of its top seven players
under 72 percent.

But Majenrs praised Pitt up and
down, saying Pitt’s recent troubles
could probably be attributedito a
rugged conference schedule. He
said Pitt is a deep and talented
club and especially cited the
Panther frontline. Majerus expects
a difficult matchup with Pitt center
Eric Mobley and power forward
Chris McNeal.

“The body size of those kids is
incredible,” Majerus said. “If th'ose
are average bodies in the Big East
I’d hate to see the football teams.
Those kids have got SOm€ major
league bodies. The Utah Jazz
don’t have bodies like some of
those kids have.

“[Mob1eyl should be a career
NBA player, the low block guy.
You know he’s got just extraordi-
nary hands and a very nice touch
and he runs the ﬂoor fairly well.”
