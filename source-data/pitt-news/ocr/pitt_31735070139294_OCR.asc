The Reserve Ofﬁcer’s Training

lawn. Ninety—six cadets from Pitt,
Duquesne, Carnegie Mellon and
Point Park comprise the group
that waits for two school buses to
transport us to Ligonier’s Outdoor
Odyssey for a weekend of weap-
ons training, strategic squad exer-
cises and obstacle courses. Cadets
from Robert Morris, California

students are MS—l]Is and MS—IVs.
After graduation, the ROTC ca-
dets can enroll in three programs:
National Guard, Army Reserves or
active duty. Some students choose
National Guard and the Reserves
because they want a civilian job

and what some call “a life” after"

the ROTC, Digrutollo said.
As of Oct. 3, about 43 percent
of the 165,500 troops in Iraq came

from the Army Reserve and the

National Guard, according to the
US Department of State; '

Regardless of their choice after
college, all of these students could
face deployment once they gradu-
ate.

Digrutollo is active duty. He
said he joined the Army ROTC

try” —— the typical answer from a
cadet.

We anive later than expected. I enter the
communications bunk where Diggs sits ata

The screen door squeaks open and execu-
tive ofﬁcer Roy Beeson walks in, dispenses
coffee into a Styrofoam cup and sits down
on a metal folding chair across from me.

Two cadets carrying unarmed pistols en-
ter the bunk and give the guns to Diggs.

“You packin’?” asks Beeson.

Diggs lifts up the back of his shirt and

‘ acts like ,he’s shoving the gun into his pants

to hide it and Beeson starts singing the
acoustic version of Easy E’s “Boyz in the

Hood” by Dynamite Hack.

It’s an ironically comedic sight, especial-
ly because Beeson, like most of the ofﬁcers
at camp, has been overseas on active duty.

The cadets may take this weekend seri-
ously, but the ofﬁcers have a different per-

‘ spective. -

“It’s different. It’s a totally different envi-
ronment over there,” said Second Lieuten-
ant Mark Klenk.

. Klenk drove a fuel truck in Iraq from

‘ November 2003 to April 2004. He joined

ROTC so when he ﬁnished the program he
could enter ofﬁcer 

“You come here and we’re out in the
mountains and safe,” Klenk said while ob-
serving cadets crawling on the ground dur-
ing a training exercise.

Later, while overseeing cadets throwing
grenades at targets that look like people,
Beeson explained he was in ROTC at Le-

durnmy that looks like a woman wearing a
babushka in the face.

“I like it!” Beeson said.

“We get them out here on their time, away
from the classroom and from their friends
and all the distractions and every hour they
spend here is equal to a week spent at Pitt in

high University in 1995.

1997 as an ofﬁcer. He’s

MS—I[Is sign a contract to stay in ROTC
after their “trial run” as MS—Is-and MS-IIs
has expired. A III is contractually commit-
ted to the program, ‘while Is and HS feel less
obligation. ' T

Still, some MS—l]Is are preoccupied with
other activities they’re missing out on back
at home. a

. MS—I1I Hunter Cavey is the back—up
long snapper for Cal U’s undefeated football
team that is playing rival IUP this weekend.

“It’s a huge game. We’re both undefeat-
ed. I’m pissed because I want to be out there
with my team. I wouldn’t be playing, but I
miss it. I want to be out there,” Cavey said in
the woods during a squad tactical exercise.

Captain Jen Miller, a MS—IV from Pitt
Greensburg, organized the exercise. She
briefed the NS who would be ambushing
the HTS While they patrol the woods. .

Miller later confessed she couldn’t wait
to get home and have a few drinks on Sun-
day.

In the meantime, ofﬁcers grade Miller on
her brieﬁng.

“I want everyone to keep communicat-
ing. Check in every ﬁve minutes. Just call
me and tell me what’s going on. Don’t be an
asshole about it, but don’t be like Mr. Rogers
either,” she said.

Like every MS—IV, Miller composes her-
self throughout the weekend despite longing
for a few normal days off.

The MS-IVs organized the entire trip.

when the NS briefed Colonel John Bender
on a summary of the weekend’s activities.

One feels Bender’s presence throughout
the camp: ,

If he wanders to your group, cadets
tighten up and pay attention to every word
and action. He is the all-seeing eye and the
all—knowing mind — cadets respect him no
matter what.

When Bender walks into the cabin where
the MS—IVs prepare theirbrieﬁng, the room
hushes as if Bender sucked all the air out of
the cabin with one breath. He sits down and
the MS—IVs, nervous and stuttering, sum-
marize the weekend.

Captain~Tim Dufner, a senior MS-IV at
Pitt, explains the sleeping arrangements for
the IIIs, who are required to sleep outside.
He tells the Colonel only two men would be
staying awake on ﬁre guard that night.

Fire guard is a routine patrol of the
campsite at night. Someone must always be
awake to monitor the camp and the cadets.

Bender says he recommends 33 percent
of the IHs sleeping outside stay awake for
ﬁre guard.

But Dufner rebuts and says the night

SGB too vague on
panther project

The Student Government
Board has been facing criticism
for its decision to spend about
$60,000 on 10 ﬁberglass panther
statues — and for good reason.

The board was both hasty
and ill—informed in its decision-
making process this summer over
whether to spend what could

" range between $47,850, accord-

ing to SGB president Shady He-
nien’s estimate, and $70,000 ac-
cording to a board member who
wishes to remain anonymous, on
the panther statues.

The board plans to assign 10

randomly selected student orga- .

nizations to decorate the statues
every year.

Board members who voted
against the project — which was
intended to help build school
spirit — cite lack of student or-
ganization feedback, incomplete
research and the likelihood that
the proposal draws from some
members’ wish to leave a mark
before the upcoming elections as
their chief objections to the pan-
ther project.

According to board member
Sheila Isong, who voted against

formed of all of the facts, adding
that she’s still not sure that they
have all of the facts.

One of these facts is how ex-
actly the board plans to ﬁnance

the project and what it plans to 0

do with the panther statues after
the alumni vote ‘on the winner at
Light—Up Night.

Henien admits that the board

will use funds from the student ac-
tivity fee to cover the initial costs
of the project, but has suggested
that businesses might sponsor the
statues in the future, citing busi-
ness support of similar efforts at
Boston University.
_ We" support the decision to
have local businesses sponsor the
project — if SGB had received
investments from businesses be-
fore it agreed to pay the initial
$60,000.

It is irresponsible to cover the
project’s initial costs on the as-
sumption that businesses will pay
them back down the line. Sure,
businesses might welcome the
idea of investing in the statues,
but what if they don’t?

And even if businesses weren’t
interested, there are countless oth-
er ways SGB could have funded
the project.

asm” as part of his justiﬁcation
for ordering the statues. Why
didn’t he call on the alumni to
help fund the project? H

On the issue of what will be
done with the statues after Light-
Up Night, SGB has only said that
it hopes to put them on display
around the Cathedral of Learn-
ing and the William Pitt Union
until they are repainted the fol-
lowing year — another logistical
nightmare.

these statues.

Our last, and strongest, objec-
tion toward the SGB decision is
the large expense it is making
toward something that can be
achieved so simply.

If SGB wants to increase
school spirit, there are less ex-
pensive and vmore all—encom-
passing alternatives.

Rather than limiting only
10 organizations to getting in-
volved, why not purchase space
for a mural, which multiple stu-
dent groups could take part in
painting?

The bottom line here is

that $60,000 is a lot of money.

small budgets. j .

We commend SGB members
Isong, Alexis Chidii and Lacee

If they made this decision in

f giles howard and carolyn gerecht
 I take on the most engaging issues of the week, from the Armenian

World

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has called on
Congress to pass a resolution that labels the
Worid \/llar lera killings of Annenians as a
genocide.

Turk/.=y'stJopger\era|i/ilamedthatitvvillciittieswiththe

Sil€$2Although the genocidal crimes

% of the Turkish government are 90 years
-in the past, now is the time to set the

record straight and oﬂicially recognize
the ﬁrst genocide of the 20th century.

Some things are more important
than maintaining good relations with
an ally and the faithful representation of
history is one of these.

InArmenia, 1.5 million people per-
ished in a series of forced marches and
outright massacres deliberately planned

' by the Turkish government. By failing

to adequately recognize these events as
genocidaland, not forcing the Turkish
government to come to terms with its

V past, we risk allowing similar events to

ocxzur once again
The Turkish government has an
abysmal record of violating» the human
‘rights of minority populations  its
borders, but perhaps our involvement
in the Armenian issue would set the
stage for greater world attention to these -
more recent episodes of repression
I Now is the time for our Congress

and the Presidentto send amessageto

the Turks. Let us not allow a few air-
bases to stand in the way of justice and
historical accuracy. .

carolynzi understand the sense of

urgency that many World War I veter-
ans feel in labeling the genocide. Ire-
spect the dedication they have shown
totl1eircountry,andIadmitthatatthe
very least, they deserve this “favor” in
retum. '
However, the costs of passing the
resolution seriously outweigh the ben-
eﬁts. Our relations with Turkey would

be severely put at risk and honestly, the A

United States already has enough en-
emies. Not passing the resolution isn’t
 equivalent of believing it wasn’t a
genocide.

Already, 23 countries have recog-
nized the Armenians’ murders as such,
so surely there isn’t still much debate
going on The United States would just
beanother name on alonglist.

Of course, the atrocities were ex-
treme and terrifying for all involved
However, we must keep our priorities
straight As long as we remain socially
conscious that genocide existed then
—- and take action against the genocide
existing today in Darﬁir — there’s little
need to label the actions of Turkey with
this resolution. It’s dangerous and frank-
ly, unrealistic.

Dear Editor,

The Pitt News should cover the

loose adverts (and we can’t forget a
hefty coating of nightclub ﬂiers). I’ll
never understand how these people get

Yes, conservatives might claim
that Gore is exaggerating. But, the
issue is at least on the table.

Others believe that while Gore
does deserve credit for raising
awareness, he isn’t worthy of such
a prestigious award as the Nobel
Peace Prize, suggesting that he
back up his words. Is that a joke?

Because of Gore’s efforts,

Radiohead returns

You don’t have to pay for the most antici-

Actually, that’s not true. This isn’t the

most anticipated album of 2007 because Ra-

V diohead released In Rainbows 10 days after it

armounced that it had ﬁnished the album. The
anticipation a record label normally relies on

to create hype and more sales has been kicked ‘

to the side of the road by these industry veter-

Pitt Rep gets recruited

 

by Tony J ovenitti
Staff Writer

Director Holly Thuma has made a trium-
phant return to the Pitt Repertory Theatre to
direct “The Recruiting Ofﬁcer,” a play that
was originally written by George Farquhar
as a satire against the rigorous recruiting tac-
tics of the British ofﬁcers during the War of
Spanish Succession.

While it might be difﬁcult to ﬁnd hu-
mor in the actual text of the play, when it
is brought to life onstage, the comedy is
nonstop. The play depicts the tale of sev-
eral recruiting ofﬁcers who attempt to con
poor and illiterate young men into enlist-
ing in the army. They also work hard to
recruit the women into their beds. The
production ﬁnds its strength in the sarcasm
and physical comedy of the characters.

Lily Junker (Silvia) and Joseph J. Jackson
(Plume), the production’s leading couple,
deliver an excellent performance that keeps
the audience rooting for their love through-

out the show. Silvia even gives the play a
hint of feminism as she attempts to pass for
a gentleman and, for the most part, succeeds.

Junker and Jackson also have a terriﬁc
supporting cast at their side. Tom Chun
(Worthy) and Lauren Ann Diesch (Melinda)
successfully provide another love story that

many can relate to, where both lovers frus-
trate the other by playing hard to get. Kate
Mickere (Rose) also does an excellent job by
portraying a lustful young woman in a man-
ner that is both believable and humorous. -

The most experienced actress in the cast,
Elena Alexandratos, is a member of the Ac-
tor’s Equity Association and is a veteran of
Pittsburgh theatre. Her character, Balance, is
the mother ﬁgure of the play, and Alexandra-
tos splendidly performs this role.

But Patrick ‘Berger undeniably steals the
show. His acting is so over the top that it ﬁts in
perfectly with the satirical nature of the pro-

Warhol proves neons
for more than beer

 

by Jacob Spears
Staﬂ Wrtter

Some neon signs tell us more than

where the beer is.

In fact, a new exhibit ‘at The Andy
Warhol Museum uses neon lights to ex-
press notions of everything from violence
and sex to ‘love and death.

“Elusive Signs: Bruce Nauman Works

with Light” is a collection of neon signs '

and other artwork involving lights from
the ﬁrst two decades of the American art-
ist’s career.

Starting in the mid—1960s, Nauman’s
career has been tirelessly innovative,
mainly because he’s never conformed to
any artistic traditions and has constantly
utilized different mediums at different
points in his life;

duction. His character, Brazen, is a recruiting  

ofﬁcer, but he is extremely feminine. The au-
dience carmot help but question his sexuality,

_ yet the play never does. He even swordﬁghts

for a girl. His girlish screams and mannerisms
make his character all the more hilarious.

The protestors from the Pittsburgh Orga-
nizing Group that lined Forbes Avenue last
month will ﬁnd this play particularly arnus—

ing if not supportive of their arguments. The I

play takes an interesting stance on ethical is-
sues of military recruiting.

It is unknown whether Thuma directed .-
this play because she believes in this view of 

recruitment or because it is just a great play.
Either way, the cast and crew achieve an ex-
cellent production of this classic 18th cen-
tury play. It can be difﬁcult to follow if you
are not familiar with 18th century English,
but it is hilarious nonetheless. The company
clearly put the extra effort into this produc-
tion, and the nonstop laughs reverberating
through the theatre are proof of it.

“The Recruiting Ofﬁcef’ runs until Sun-
day, Oct. 21 in the Henry Heymann Theatre
in the Stephen Foster Memorial.

You know what they say about clowns with big hands...

In the early stages of Nauman’s fascina-
tion with neon lights, many of his works
contained several different words juxta-
posed together.

“Life, Death, Love, Hate, Pleasure,
Pain” is a large neon sign; the words in
the title are curved and run together to
make a circle. Each word takes a turn to
light up, which gives the piece a unique
cyclical movement. A

"‘Raw War” is another word piece
made of neon lights, which spells the

word ‘war,’ but each letter lights up in '

succession — sometimes spelling ‘war,’
sometimes spelling ‘raw.’

Nauman once described these neon-
word pieces as having a poetic quality.

“I think the point where language
starts to break down as a useful tool of
communication is the same edge where
poetry and art occurs,” Nauman said.

In this way, Nauman takes commonly-
used words and incorporates them into
his work to present the themes and ideas
behind the words in a striking and at ﬁrst

, confusing fashion in hopes the viewer

reconsiders the place of these words in

everyday life.

lights and proves that they can be used for more than showing what beer is available.

Pop-punk youngsters

dance into the station

 

by Anton Skerl
Staff Write/‘

Looks like the electronic pop culture has
some new kids on the block. Thankfully,
they’re cool kids, as newcomers Metro Station
burst out with some of the catchiest songs and
choruses to grace the music world in a long
time, although the experienoeitselfcanbebrief.

- The band consists of Trace Cyrus and Ma-
son Musso on vocals and guitars, with Blake
Healy on keyboards and synthesizers, rounded
out with Anthony Irnprogo on drums. Most of
the members are no older than 18. The band
decided to release its ﬁrst single “Seventeen
Forever” (sans Irnprogo; he came later) on
Myspace, then realized, to their shock, that
they had become overnight Internet celebrities.

Because of the exposure, an intern at
Red Ink discovered it, and the band is hap-
pily signed. It released its self-titled debut just
last month and is touring all over the country,
spreading a youthful presence and sound.

The songs are catchy. What really helps the
band stand out is its use of synthesizers and
keyboards that may make some ’80s enthusi-
asts shed a tear of nostalgia. Not only that, but
the band also appeals to today’s crowd thanks
to its vibrant energy that will either make your
head hop to the beat relentlessly or dance the
night away.

The versatility of the instruments is also
interesting; sometimes they’ll remind listeners
of old—school soft beat “Sonic the Hedgehog”
game tracks, while others have a nice edge. No
matter the songs’ intro, they all eventually co-
alesce to a great beat Think The Killers with
more of a punk inﬂuence and more electronics.

Here’s what’s interesting about the synthe-
sizer: It doesn’t upstage the vocals or even the
music. Instead everything ﬂows seamlessly to-
gether with the synths accentuating the vocals
nicely. That shows two things. First, the band
mates know how to work well with each other

 

and compliment their respective talents. And
second, these guys are in foraprosperous future
if they can keep this delicate balance in check.

Speaking of balance, the rest of the group
also performs well. There aren’t really a lot
of guitar solos, but the licks are ﬁm and work
well with the electronics. The vocals are also
energetic yet laid back,- making for some awe-
some harmonies that push the choruses deep
into the listeners’ minds.

And the lyrics themselves are good.
They ﬁt the songs’ moods well and remind
people of what it was like to be young and
maybe a bit stupid. That can only be ac-
complished by a group of young people
who know what it takes to go out and have
a good time and how to make it happen.

But like all good things, there are some

Courtesy Columbia / Red Ink Records

minor gripes. The lyrics themselves feel a tad
disjointed and can be lost in the airy singing,
a la “Louie Louie,” but people will probably
be too engrossed or too busy dancing to care.
As for problem No. 2, the album is too short
— it barely measures above a half hour with
more than 10 tracks. Still, what a halfhour it is.

All in all, Metro Station’s self-titled
debut is a ﬁm blend of old—school synth
with new school sounds sure to be a hit
with young crowds and people who like
a good time. All the tracks are danceable,
especially “Shakin’ It,” which should be
a staple of many dance parties to come.

If you want to round out your playlist with
something new, give these guys a try, as they’ll
remind you of what it was like to be a teen all
overagain:brieﬂftmandespeciallymemorable.

Former rock ‘11’ roll wife riffs on lovers

Many people fantasize about living the rock
‘n’ roll lifestyle. Imagine writing a hit song, ex-
periencing the thrill of performing in front of
screaming fans and making millions of dollars.

Few people, however, pause to think about
the people that inspire these rock ‘n’ rollers.
What would it be like to be a muse? Pattie
Boyd tells readers how she inspired some of
rock’s most memorable songs in her autobi-
ography, “Wonderful Tonight”

Known primarily for being the wife of two
legendary guitar heroes, George Harrison and
Eric Clapton, Boyd spent most of her lifetime
in the shadow of her famous men. The book
begins slowly, describing the muse’s early
years living in Kenya. Growing up in a bro-
ken home, Boyd had a rough time until she
emerged as one of the top fashion models in
London during the swinging ’60s.

Boyd’s life forever changed when she
met: George Harrison on theset of the Beatles
ﬁlm “A Hard Day’s Nigh ” —— Harrison pro-
posed to the model the day he met her. While
they didn’t immediately many, Boyd was
soon ﬂung into the Beatles’ madcap world of
screaming fans, drugs and smothering fame.
She learned to step out of the spotlight and
stand by her husband’s side. He was frequent-
ly distracted by drugs and women, though.

Boyd gives us plenty of juicy stories about

Staﬂ Writer

the private lives of the Beatles. Multiple Beat-
les biographers have often covered her stories,
but hearing these infamous tales from Boyd’s
point of view can be interesting, even if they
seem a little biased.

One of the sweetest parts of the book is
when Boyd describes how Harrison wrote
the hit song “Something” for her. Today,
“Something” is the most covered love song
of all time. James Brown and Frank Sinatra
recorded George Harrison’s favorite versions,
but Boyd’s favorite version of the song was
the one he played for her at their kitchen table.

Because ‘of a few years of neglect and
inﬁdelity, Boyd left the handsome Har-
rison for Eric Clapton, who had been pur-
suing her for some time. Clapton would
write beautiful and passionate letters to
Boyd. His frantic, lusty pursuit inspired
one his most popular ballads, “Layla.”

Boyd spent the next 10 years with Clap-
ton, putting up with his heroin use, alcohol-
ism and rampant inﬁdelities. She kept ﬁnding
excuses to stay in her abusive marriage until
she discovered that Clapton had secretly im-
pregnated two other women during his times
on tour.

Throughout “Wonderful Tonight” we re-
alize that rock stars like the Beatles and Eric
Clapton lived like adult children. After she

divorced Clapton in the late ’80s, Boyd real-
ized that she would actually have to pay bills.
She didn’t pay her ﬁrst electricity bill until her
late 405. Members of rock royalty never had
to think for themselves as they had employees
and “yes men” to do all their business for them.

While Pattie Boyd spent much of her life

in gorgeous mansions or vacationing with the _

rock ‘n’ roll elite, she really lived a sad exis-
tence. She lived like a‘ chﬂd, being told how to
live and stand beside her powerful husbands.
She was often lonely and turned to alcohol
and drugs for help. She rarely stood up for

herself, and her lack of conﬁdence allowed g

others to control her life.

“Wonderful Tonight” is a very interesting
read for fans of classic rock. Boyd takes us
to places that the fans and media have never
seen before. An avid photographer, Boyd ﬁlls
the book with never before seen pictures of
her rock star home life. ‘

The book is sometimes poorly written,
however, with Boyd often failing to give_
proper insight into her life. She frequently will
devote a paragraph to discussing her favorite
dress rather than telling us about more event-
ful stories, like the Beatles breakup. “Won-

derful Tonight” gives us an excellent view
into the world of rock ‘n’ roll, but it might be
a view that we’re unwilling to see.

be a moral sticking point for dedicated fans. Is
it fair to obtain something you want so badly
for nothing? Figure that out on your own time.
Some of us have an album to listen to, and
what an album it is. ‘

V The album is difﬁcult to classify at
ﬁrst. In Rainbows recalls the sound of The
Bends and Kid A the most, but only com-
paratively, as Radiohead’s sound has ma-
tured immeasurably since those two albums.
Vocalist Thom Yorke has, in fact, com-
pared the feeling on the album to OK Com-
puterfs sound, but youihear what you hear.

You’ll deﬁnitely notice more of a jazz inﬂu-
ence on the ﬁrst track, “l5 Step,” and that jazz
sound pervades throughout the album. It dis-
places the electronic and heavier guitar work
from Hail to -the Thief, but don’t mutter about
this just yet:_There is still an ebullient sense of

The sound ismellowerthan in past albums:
It is neither unsettling like  or Thief,
nor dire and even paranoid like OK Comput-

the style varying less than in previous albums.
However, in this case, it is a good

thing — the music here is fresh and enjoy-
able. There could be twice as many tracks
on this album, all sounding as similar to
each other, and listening to all of them
in one sitting would still be enjoyable.

Thom Yorke’s voice is notably more falset-
to on this album. “The Nude,” the third track
on the album, exempliﬁes this high range, and
the seventh, “Reckoner,” reiterates it at a high-
er tempo. Yorke’s voice-is strong through these

7 high notes. Past comparisons of his voice and

ChrisMartin’shaveorderedtheColdplaylead’s
voice as treading territory blazed by Yorke,
and that is obvious throughout In Rainbows.
You will never ﬁnd yourself bracing against
the possibility of Yorke’s voice cracking.

At the other end of the music, the guitars

’ still deliver heavy riffs, as in “Bodysnatch-

ers,” the second track. The guitar voice
is distorted and backed by drums that are
reminiscent of “There There,” bringing
back pleasant memories of the Thief days.
It is the hardest song on the album, which
is a little sad, but nothing to get worked up
about. Although the intensity is dialed back
on this album, there are -still good tracks such
as “House of Cards” that are softer, but gain
an edge with the opening lines “I don’t wanna
be your friend / I just wanna be your lover.”
The best song on the album is “Reckon-
er,” which combines? jazzy drumming parts, '
Yorke’s disquieting voice and traditionally
lilting guitar. There are pensive strings layered
over this, and the chillrunning down your
spine is classic Radiohead. I A
The_overall sound pushes in new direc-

‘ tions: with less effects, less twisted guitar

parts and less total sound than prior albums,
In Rainbows is minimal in comparison.
This becomes more unsettling than the

lyrics at some moments, but everything »

else about the album is outstanding. The
group has pushedin a noticeably new direc-
tion with a more thoughtful endeavor. This A
may be the best album you listen to all year, _,
and you (legally) don’t have to pay a dime.

man’s neon light era is when he started a

V series of clown depictions with lights in
the 1980s. I t~

disturbing are Nauman’s neon clowns,

ifying heavy themes such as sex and‘ war.
“Five Men Marching” is ‘a glowing
and colorful display of ﬁve neon clowns,
which are depicted as marching by alter-
nating between neon lights thatmake their
legs and arms appear to be moving up and
down, but that’s not all that is moving.
Most all of Nauman’s clowns graphical-
ly display a male organ, which transforms
from ﬂaccid to erect ‘in blinking neon.
Even more disturbing A is “Hanged
Man,” which uses a stick ﬁgure with a
clown face to imitate the children’s game

The Warhol gets all  up    

line—by—line like the game but ﬁnishes
with a limp male appendage. After this,
his legs jump up in the air and hishead
tilts to the side to signify him hanging,‘
and the clown becomes aroused once
again. ' I

Neon lights have always been used I

commercially for their seductive and al-
luring qualities. When Nauman uses them
they still retain these qualities, and when
we are immersed in a barrage of his signs
as we are here, it feels eerie. I

Accentuated by the ominous,’ buzz-
ing of the lights, “Elusive Signs” feels
like time-traveling’ to an exotic, dysto—
pian, Technicolor noir only to ﬁnd out
the world isnour own; it’s just something
we haven’t been looking at and analyzing
the way Nauman has, perhaps because its
meaning still eludes us.

Pitt interim athletic director Donna Sanft, a
former Pitt stand-out student athlete, wants to
give all Pitt students the chance to succeed.

by Jay Huerbin
CV0/rtriéutirzg Editor

Pitt interim athletic director Donna

» Sanft sometimes works from 7 a.m. to

9:30 p.m., but she wouldn’t trade her job
for anything.

“I love the University of Pittsburgh,
and I am incredibly grateful for the op-
portunities I have been given as a student,
athlete and employee at Pitt,” Sanft said.

Sanft grew up in nearby Monessen and
graduated from Monessen High School
in 1970.

She then attended Pitt and since has
made a noticeable impact both as a stu-
dent and as an administrator.

As an incoming freshman in the fall
of 1970, Sanft took part in the gymnas-

. tics program, where she was a three-tirne

captain and named Pitt’s Female Scholar
Athlete of the Year as a senior in 1974.
Although she graduated from Pitt that
year, she never-quite left.
Sanft was then hired to coach the gym-
nastics team — the same team for which
she played the season before. Her coach-

ing tenure would last 12 years, from 1974
to 1986, and was good enough for an
overall record of 82—50—l and two East-
ern Collegiate Coach of the Year awards.

Even after she stopped coaching, Sanft
stayed within the Panthers organization.
In 1987, she became the senior associate

‘athletic director for administrationand

s_till holds that position, even after being
named interim athletic director to imme-
diately replace the departed Jeff Long,
who was hired as the athletic director for
Arkansas -last month.

Currently occupying both of the above I

positions, Sanft is responsible for super-
vising student athletes’ academic eligibil-
ity and ﬁnancial aid.

She has played a big role in the pro-
fessional development within the depart-
ment and the department’s planning strat-
egies. I

Sanft is in charge of making sure that
Pitt’s athletic programs are in line with
the NCAA rules and education programs,
and she runs Panther Game Plan, which
is the life—skills program within in the de-
partment.

Pitt interim athletic director Donna Sanft, right, is 31 Pittsburgh native, and wants to keep
giving athletes like former Panther great Curtis Martin, middle, a chance to succeed.

However, one of her most remarkable
accomplishments is overseeing and staff-

the Pitt athletic department.

It’s a non—alcoholic social environ-

ment with free food, games and music ‘

held before each home football game out-

side PNC Park, for which student interest
has been rising.

Sanft’s love for Pitt causes her to strive‘
to make the best contribution to not only
the athletics department but to the entire

, University and student-life experience.

at Pitt, and although some things have

changed around the University, she still

Women’s soccer frozen

in brittle New England”

by Tony Ferraiolo

It was a rough trip to the Northeast for the
Pitt women’s soccer team, which dropped
games to both No. 17 UConn and Providence

“over the weekend.

The Panthers (6-8-0, 1-6-0 Big East) have
now lost ﬁve straight conference games.

“With the Panthers struggling, head coach
Sue-Moy Chin decidedto make a change in
net. She opted to go with Morie Kephart over
Alison Finch in both games. Finch had previ-
ously started all 12 games between the posts
for Pitt.

“We just were uying to make a change
to give another player a chance,” Chin said
regarding her decision. “[Kephart] had been

playing pretty well.”

No matter how well Kephart could have
played last weekend, the Panthers still strug-
gled. Collectively, the Panthers were outshot
23-10 in their two matches. Only one of those
10 shots was on goal, and the only score slat-
ed by Pitt came on a penalty kick.

The Panthers had been looking to rebound
from two distiessing overtime losses against.
Louisville and Cincinnati last weekend but
were unable to retum home with a victory.

“We’re obviously disappointed we didn’t
come away with at least one win this week-
end,” head ooach Sue-Moy Chin said. “And
overall we’re just disappointed we didn’t,
come away with three points.”

wants to make sure every student gets the
most out of his time.

When asked about her goals for the
department now that she is interim ath-
letic director, Sanft replied by saying that
her and the athletics department’s No. 1
priority “has always been, and will al-
ways be, the welfare of the students.”

Sanft works, hard to make sure that
athletics contribute to the experience of
the student.

‘Whether they are members of a team
or attending a Pitt sporting event, Sanft
wants to make sure that students are en-
joying themselves.

’ Sanft also believes that the coaches
at Pitt have a lot of aspirations for their
teams and are always working hard to
take make the step to improve on the na-
tional level.

While some sports are struggling and
others are on the rise, she realizes that the
public perception might be differentifrom
the internal.

,“The Pitt athletics department has en-

joyed many successes over the years,”

Sanft said, “and our future is-incredibly

bright.” A

Sanft said that she is “conﬁdent in
the abilities of our coaches and athletic
department staff as we continue to strive
for greatness in all of our programs, and I
look forward to my continued work with
all of them as we move forward.” '

In 2003, Sanft was part of the search
committee looking for a new athletic di-
rector.

Although she is no longer on that
committee, she does not have intentions
at this time to make this interim position
a permanent job. i

“At this moment, I am not looking to
be a candidate for athletic director,” Sanft
said.

Sanft says she wants to work hard and

not “skip a beat” while serving as the irifi

terim athletic director. Her goal is to con-
tinue to improve and make Pitt athletics
better.

And no matter who the next athletic
director is, Sanft wants him to walk in on
the ﬁrst day and say that the person be-
fore him did a great job.

Ce game winnable

the Huskies a 3-0 lead. Eng, who
struck ﬁrst, would also get the plea-
sure of capping the scoring.

In the 66th minute, Eng lofted
a left-footed shot from outside the
18 box that snuck its way over
Kephart, giving Eng the hat trick
and giving the Huskies a 40 vic-
tory.

UConn goalie Stephanie Labbe
posted the shutout for the Huskies
without being called upon to make
a save — none of the Panthers’ ﬁve
shots were on target. '

What seemed to be a one-sided
contest was a close match for a third
of the game, according to Chin.

“UConn’s a very good team. I
thought we played really well with
them for probably the ﬁrst 30 min-
utes of the game,” Chin added.

Providence 2, Pitt 1 I

The Panthers dropped their
second consecutive game in New
England with a 2-1 loss to Provi-
dence Sunday afternoon. VV1th the
victory Providence (3-10-1, 2-5-0)

moved past Pitt in the BigEast

standings.

The Panthers’ ﬁrst goal of the
road trip came early on against the
Friars. In the ninth minute of the
game Rachel Vecchio set up the
score. Vecchio penetrated the box
and was fouled on her nm towards
the net, drawing a whisﬂe and, as
a result, a penalty kick that Ashley
Habbel would convert.

But Providence would knock in

‘ a goal in the 44th minute, and that

would be all ﬁom the Friars.
Because with the score tied at
1-1 in the 74th minute, the Panthers
did themselves in with an own-goal
thatﬁnalized the scoring at 2-1.
Chin felt the Panthers let one
get away. _ ,
“We thought the Providence
game was very winnable game for
us,” Chin added. I
. “I felt we were a better team on
that day than they were, but they
capitalized on some of our own
mistakes. We pretty much beat
ourselves.” ' . .
