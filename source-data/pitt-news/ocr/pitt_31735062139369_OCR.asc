Practically all arrangements are

of The Pitt W'eekly. The affair will

‘be of ‘tremendous importance for the

University and for Pittsburgh in gen-

It has 3,500 members, distributed over
38 local societies. It conducts and

Mr. George Siebel, the well—known

THE PITT

WEEKLY

BIG CROWD ATTENDS CHAPEL.

CD1‘. Robinson Addressed Student on

Character Building.

At the chapel exercises on Wednes-
day last there was standing room only
because the crowd was the

moved from the room ingwhich chapel
was held._ On,account of not being
able to secure the First United Pres-
byterian Church theexercises were

. ‘ held in Room 107 Thaw Ixiall.

Dr. A.'R‘. Robinson of the Sixth

J ‘United Presbyterian Church addressed

the:-students. . He -said in part: “I
have three propositions to place be-
fore you this morning, namely: (1)
that ‘character is the best. asset a man
can have; (2) that at man does not

«cident; (3) that the church is the
best conservative agent of character
in the world to-day.

the conservation of our national re-
sources——and it is right that we should
take action along this line, but it is

.vastly more important that we take

steps t_o conserve the character of the

" . that counts these days.

“Character is not an accidental

, growth. Character building is the
’ most deﬁnite of all constructions in

the world. The home is one of the
greatest factors in the building of
‘character. Home inﬂuence sticks to
a man, more or less, during his entire

’A (life, and he cannot get away from this

‘inﬂuence entirely. Companionship is
another great molder of character. A
man is oftenijudged by the company
he keeps. But, above all, remember
character is not made by chance or

- accident. .

' “That the church is the best con-
servative agent of character there is

_ no doubt. ‘The church has been great-

ly criticized for not taking an active

part in settlement work, and perhaps .

the church has failed a little here. But
I tell you the best workers in settle-
iment and social betterment activities
are members of the church, and are in
the work because of the good inﬂu-
ence the church has had over them.
“The home that is the best home is
the home in which the inﬂuence of the

that the best men come. ‘
.“Also, it has been the inﬂuence and
power of the church that has made
it possible that the best book in the
world——_the Bible—is open to all who

i wish to read it.

“In closing, I just want to repeat
my three propositions and leave them
for you to think about: '

“(l) That character is a man’s best
asset. '

“(2) That character is not gained
by chance.

“(3)‘ That the, church is the best

BIOLOGISTS TO HAVE MUSEUM

The department of Biology of the
University will make a valuable addi-
tion to their equipment in the form
of a museum.- The cases have arrived
and it is expected to have them ar-
ranged within a week. ,,

The museum will be set up inthe
second ﬂoor of State Hall along both
sides of the hallway. The cases are
of brown ﬁnished oak with glass slid-
ing doors. They are in sections so
that more may be added with the ac-
cumulation of various specimens. This
will be a very instructive department
for any one interested in biology or
not. , ' ~

The specimens already in possession
of the instructor have long needed a
ﬁnal resting place, where they could
be displayed to advantage. Hitherto
they have been piled helter skelter on
every shelf or window sill, in every
nook and corner in the biology labora-
tory. A. great number of new and in-
teresting specimens have been re-
ceived and any others donated will be
labeled with the name of the donor
and placed in the cases. _

Every one is_invited to inspect the
museum in which there are a great
many rare specimens.

Dr. J. C. Fetterman, in introducing
the Chancellor, "compared him to a
human dynamo, and said that it was
the work of this man more than any
other which had placed Pitt on its
present basis. Dr. McCormick out-
lined the plans for the coming anni-
versary and traced the history of the
college department.

Dr. G. A. M. Dyess,~as representa-
tive of the faculty, stated that he had
always considered his interests iden-

ENGINEERS MAKE VISI'TS._

 

On Saturday, December 2, the en-
gineering freshmen made an inspec-
tion trip of the Hamilton glass fac-
tory, the Heinz pickle factory anclithe
ﬁltration plant at Aspinwall. _

An interesting feature of the two
former factories is that they have dis-
tinctly different met'hods of making
bottles. The Hamilton company ‘make
bottles by blowing the glass, while
the Heinz company makes them by
machinery. ‘

The ﬁltration plant is one of‘ the
most important and most essential
public works in Pittsburgh. It is a
great privilege to be able to visit it
and to walk in its’ subterranean cham-
bers. The students appreciated this
treat most heartily and conceded it to
be the best of the season so far.

bers'—Next Week.

The next regular meeting of the
Alumni Council will be held in Room
105 Thaw Hall on Monday, December
18, 1911,’ at 8 P. M.

Mr. Silverman, the secretary of the
association, has sent out the notices
to the different members of the coun-
cil, and it is expected that every mem-
ber will be present. The business to

ciation; report of the employment bu-
reau; and last, the consideration of
plans for the one hundred and twenty-
ﬁfth anniversary of the birth of the
University. ’

The students are indebted to the

ciation for the steps taken in the cam-
paign for the million and a half of
dollars; and for the splendid bureau
of student employment established at
the beginning of this term.

The friends of the University are
awaiting with great interest the de-
cision of the alumni regarding the
plans for the greatest celebration
“Pitt” has ever held. They promise
their hearty co-operation in as far as
possible ‘in the movement the alumni
has undertaken.

 

SENIOR CLASS MEETING.

 

The Senior class met Friday morn-
ing in the chapel. Important busi-
ness was considered and discussed,
among which was the class ‘memorial,
the commencement invitations, and
the commencement and class day pro-
grams.

Attention!

The ranks having been broken by recent gradu==
ations, eleven new men are to- be recruited from the
various classes of the University of Pittsburgh, into

a‘ -recognition of the important place
that Pitt is making for itself in the
classical world. These organizations
have never before met in Pittsburgh,

though the American Philological As- _

sociation is 42 years old and the Insti-
tute is 32 years old.

' All the day meetings will be ‘held in
Thaw Hall, in which also will be situ-
ated the Bureau of Information, etc.
At the first meeting, on Wednesday,
December 27, in Carnegie Lecture
Hall, Chancellor S. B. McCormick
will make the address of welcome. On
Thursday, December 28, the Universi-
ty will give a luncheon in the banquet
hall of the Soldiers’ Memorial. In
the afternoon a tea will be given at
the Hotel Schenley, and Dr. Holland
will give a smoker the same evening
at the University Club. Dr. Holland
is president of the Pittsburgh Society
of the Archaeological Institute.

Prof._Ullman will represent Pitt on
the program by presenting a paper on

Horace and Tuibullus at the Friday
morning session. Representatives of
Harvard, Columbia, Princeton, Penn-
sylvania, Chicago, Vassar_, Bryn
Mawr, Johns Hopkins, Toronto and
many other institutions will present
papers. M. Franz Cumont, Conserva-
teur aux Musees Royaux de Bruxelles
and Membre de l’Academic Royal de
Belgique, a scholar known the world
ov-er for his books onthe religions of
Greece and Rome, is on the program.
So is Prof. Breasted of the University
of Chicago, the famous Egyptologist.

The public is invited to attend the
meetings, especiallyithe evening ses-
sions, which will be of more general
interest. Most of the archaeological
papers will ‘be illustrated by stereop—
ticon. At the meeting on Thursday
evening, in Carnegie Lecture Hall, Mr.

Hoppin, who has just returned from

Cyrene in Northern Africa, will re-’

port on the excavations at that place.
They have been temporarily halted by
the Turko-Italian war. Before the
war began one of the corripanions of
Mr. Hoppin was killed by Arabs. The
United States Government then sent
the Chester to protect the party.
There will also be a report on the ex-
cavations at Sardis in Asia Minor.
Both lectures will be illustrated.

On Friday evening, in the same hall
there will be illustrated lectures on
excavations at Athens ‘ and Knidos.
and one on the originnand signiﬁcance
of the Pyramid Form by Prof.
Breasted. Besides paper dealing with
classical archaeology, life, languages
and literatures, there will be papers on
Egyptian archaeology and on Renais-
sance art. Copies of the complete
program may be obtained from Prof.
Scribner or Prof. Ullman.

Prof. Scribner is chairman of the
local committee on arrangements, and
the other_university members or the
committee are Chancellor McCormick,
Secretary Linhart, Dean Fetterman
and Prof. Ullman.

ABSENT SENATORS.

Complaints have recently been madei
that several of the Senators are not‘:
attending the meetings of the Student
Senate with any reasonable d_egree of
This is 3 condition which
should not be tolerated by the Senate.
If the Senate is to be an efficient body,
a full attendance is absolutely neces-
sary. No business can be transactedf
with several members absent. Toi
make this body a strong, virile organ—i
ization, it is essential that each mem—.

ber be present at everyrmeeting. ;

If the men chosen by the differentj
classes value their duties so lig'htly as?
to be absent from the meetings ofthei
organization to which they have been:
elected, they should at least have thej
courtesy and good sense to resign and]
permit their respective classes to elect
men who will not disgrace them. A
provision should be. inserted in the‘
constitution of the Senate, providing.
for the expulsion of all members ab—i

ﬁcient excuse. In case such a pro-
vision were adopted, poorly attended
meetings.of theSenate could not oc-
cur. Every man would be present at
the regular sessions—o'r he would re-
sign in favor of a man who would
fulﬁll the duties of his position.

THE DEBATERS.

Much dissatisfaction has been
.a.rouse_:d recentlyion account of the
inactivity of the debaters. Although
the subject -had been announced for

some time, no call as yet has been .

made for candidates forrthe team. Un-
less the candidates begin work im-
mediately, the advantages offered by

Editor Pitt Weekly:

~ Dear Sir:—The Pharmacy classes
are taking considerable interest in the
new student building. They 'have,the
largest enrollment in the University
and are going to make the other de-
partments hustle to keep up with
them. It has been said that when a
body of Pharmacists get together

, something 1113.5 ‘either ‘got to move or

let them through, and this spirit you
will ﬁnd predominating in the Junior
and Senior classes of the Pittsburgh
College of Pharmacy. It was sug-
gcsted not long ago by a professor of
this depalftlllellt that he thought the
proper method of going after
matter was not to ask everyman for‘
ten dollars, but to ask of" him as he
was ﬁnancially situated, which has
worked out Very successfully on sim-—
ilar occasions. Yours truly, 1
Pharmacy Student.

Dear Sir:—I am writing to find out

Dr. B. L. Ullman is taking charge of

to the work as a xvhole; Dr, Ullman

“.\lr. Siebel has worked out a isplen— .

dents it should be a. success in every

to the tableaux perfectly.” .
In regard to. other people whohav
taken an active part in the prepara-

on Dr. Dyess and Chancellor McCor-

That the students are to make the

PITT BAND
GETS START

Athletic Committ_ge,/ Alumni and Fac-
ulty Aid Band With» Encourage-
ment and Funds.

While the Pitt Band is exclusively
a student organization, the fact that
the funds and director were furnished
by the Athletic Committee, alumni
and faculty must not be lost sight of.
When Don Kirk started this organiza-
tion, he found his job an impossible
one until he enlisted the interest of
the ever—ready Pitt supporters. The
students readily acquiesced and were
pleased at the chance to start such an
organization, but, as usual, lacked the
funds. Kirk immediately took the
matter up with the Athletic Commit-
tee and the result was thatthe neces-
sary backing was furnished. Don then
went after Saul Sabad, a Junior, who
has played in many local bands and
who readily agreed to lead the new
organization:

When Al. Hamilton heard how
things were progressing ‘he made ar-
rangements with Mr. Panella, of
Pryor’s Band, and formerly of the
Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, to
act as instructor and the music played
since then has increased in quality in
leaps and bounds. This staunch alum-is
nus is always ready to help any Pitt
organization and when '~‘ he puts his
shoulder to the wheel, the wagon al-
ways moves upvthe hill.

The coat sweaters were the gifts of

Football Rules

Need Revision

Rules Permit Luck To Determine
Important Games — More Downs
Needed.

 

The rules of 1911 accomplished the
chief purpose that they were intended
to do——elimination, to a great extent,
of injuries, but they also seemed to
have weakened the game materially.
In the ﬁrst place, the defense has been
strengthened considerably at the ex-
pense of the offense, and in the sec-
ond place the game has become a kick-
ing duel which seems to put luck and
A team under the
new rules must possess a wonderful
backﬁeld to advance the ball the re-
quired ten yards in three downs espe-
cially within the scoring zone, if the
opposition has an averageamount of
defensive power. ‘

_

When the teams are evenly matched
the quarterback will try a few plays
until he sees that it is impossible to
gain the required distance, thenhe
will call the signal for a kick. Sev-
eral line and end plays will be tried
by both teams and then the game will
resort to a,_punting_ duel, each one
hoping for the other to fumble and
luck to take a hand. This sort of
playing robs the game of-its former
attractions and will probably bring
about a revision of the present rules
at the next meeting of the Rules Com-
mittee. V _ .

letic Committee +4 Student
Band Enlivens Evening-
Go od Speeches Delivered
by Thompson, Hurst and
Others

On Saturday night "the football
squad of the University was tendered

.Committee at the University Club on
Grant boulevard. The Pitt Student
Band was there in all its glory and
rendered lively selections before, ‘after
and between times, much to the en-
joyment of eighty odd who were pres-
ent. The band, by the way, was the
object of much favorable comment in
several of the speeches‘, and is un-
doubtedly one of the most popular of
the student organizations.

Burt Smyers was the toastmaster of
the evening and many of the speakers
were given quite a send-off by this
member of the Old Guard who knows
and remembers many of the pranks
indulged in by some of his classmates
that he doesn’t mind telling. Chancel-
lor McCormick delivered the first
speech of the evening and school
spirit was the gist of his talk. Fol-
lowing this, speeches weregiven by
Floyd Rose, “Cliff” Connelly, ‘Geo.
Kirk, Walter Riddle, Jake Aronson,
Dr. Friesell, Capt.-elect “Polly” Gal-
vin, Alex. Silverman, “Tillie” Dewar,
Graduate Manager Hurst, Dr. Ash-.
brook, Garﬁeld Huston, Saul Sabad,
Dr. Linhart, Alex Stevenson and
Coach “Joe” Thompson.

Coach “Foxy Joe” Thompson dwelt
at length on the splendid work that
the graduating members of- the team
have done and wished to thank Capt.
Jack Lindsay, “Tillie” Dewar, “Raz”
Quailey, and Jim Stevenson for their
support during the pas-t several years.
He also mentioned Floyd Rose, Alex
Stevenson, Manager Hurst, Al Hamil-
ton and others for their share of the

ably on the action of the‘ Athletic
Committee in appointing an Execu-
five Committee composed of ﬁve
members, among whom are Al Hamil-
ton, Burt Smyers, Joe Trees and C.
W. Friend. Coach Thompson spoke
favorably of the spirit displayed this
season by the footballiteam and
looks for next year to be the greatest
that Pitt has everseen on the grid-
iron. ‘ -
Graduate Manager .1-Iurst spoke
about the ﬁnancial side of the season

of the season was one of the most
successful. This enthusiastic worker
has already started the schedule for
1912 and it is probable that Pitt will

‘meet two teams 011 the gridiron next

fall that Pitt followers have long
wished to play. According to Man-
ager Hurst, the spirit that has made

~ the Pitt players overcome such handi-

caps at practicing at the Oval, chang-
ing grounds in the middle of the sea-
son, etc., will go into making a team
that can’t be stopped whenthe Stadi-
um .is ﬁnished. _

“Polly” Galvin, next year’s captain,
-said" he was scared to death at ’mak-
ing a speech, but did very well con-
sidering his diminutive size. Altho’
“Polly” isn’t much of a banquet hero,
every one present realized that Pitt
would have one great leader next
year. ‘,

Prof. Alex. Silverman who was in-
strumental in obtaining the Spaulding
Trophy Cup that State recently car-
ried to Center County with them, an-
nounced that he had received the
promise of another such trophy and
prophesized that Pitt would keep it in
Pittsburgh. The games will be all the
more interesting in-« the future.

Dean H. E. Friesell said that train-.
ing should start now for next fall and.

that a rest of three months should «be
the ﬁrst step in this training. He
agreed with Coach Thompson that
track and ﬁeld work was necessaryfor
football players and urged that every
candidate report at J Trees Stadium
early in the Spring. He wished to
emphasize the fact that anything a
player did to his own detriment was
also a detriment to the football team.

Hube Hans VVagner delighted all
present with a marvelous solo on a
horn belonging to one of the band and
considering the fact that the horn was
partially ﬁlled with _napkins, rolls and

‘water, the solo was in a class by it-

self. “Freshman” Graves performed
drum,’ his
tackling being especially good, and
Roy Kernohan had the band leader on
edge for fear the bass drum would be

unable to withstand his ﬁerce assaults.

The parade between halves had any- ‘

thing that Ringling ever put up
backed off the boards until -it was
broken up by the departure of one
“Auggie” Blair, who remembered that
he was a married man andlmust be
with wifey before “Curfew
tolled the knell of parting night.” Red
Smith and Blair were in deep consul-
tation during the greater part of _the
evening, but as “Auggie” was seen to
shake his head several times, it is be-
lieved that “Red” will remain with us
tillthe end of the term at least.

 

His Intentions.

“See here, Mr. Huggins,” said the
irate landlady to one of the boarders,
“you have been ﬂirting with 1113-’
daughter, and last night I saw.yo:1
kiss her. Now, I want to. know just

LAW MIDDIES IloLD _
BANQUET AND MOCK TRIAL

 

“Gentlemen of the Jury, this man is
innocent. Look into his face and as-
certain for yourself (applause). iHe
never stole a thing in his life.” Thus
did Harry Birmingham address twelve
men of his class at the annual banquet
and mock trial held at the _Fort Pitt
Hotel on last'Tuesd.ay evening. The
argument grew warm when George
.Meyer responded, trying to prove the
guilt of the prisoner. “Gentlemen;”
he said, ‘.‘I appeal to your sense of
-‘honor; ’c‘onvict_ this nianandlshow him
that he cannot steal the ‘makings’
from a man's pocket before his very
eyes and escape iunpunished.” The
jury then retired, but after long
wrangling and heated arguments on
both sides, could reach no verdict.
Consequently the prisoner was re-
leased, but not before he had received
a scathing reprimand from the judge
;and told ‘to buy his own “makings"
hereafter. After ‘the trial speeches
were made by the various members of
the class. S. G. McKees acted as
toastmaster and gave his views on
“Class Spirit.” He was followed by
William Wharton, Harold Blemonea,
W. A. Woods’, Ehrhart Schmidt and
T. B. Humphries. Russell Yost then
gave an exhibition of piano playing
that marks him ‘as an expert. The
meeting closed with a rousing “Al-

Plucked from a hidden bush,
Stolen from shadowy bower,
Only to die in an h'our—
The thief without a blush.

Torn from a mother’s breast,
Snatched to rest undeﬁled,
Gone ,to rest ever mild——
Death has won its quest.

ORGANIZATION MEETING OF
SOCIAL SERVICEASSOCIATION

As announced in the Weekly a short

. time ago, the University is to have a

new organization known as the So-

cial Service Association of the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh. -It has been de-
cided to call forthe organization meet-
ing shortly after the Christmas vaca-
tion. Ciards will be sent out to those
interested asking them to attend the
initial meeting. Already a large num-
ber of students have expressed their
desire to join. this organization.

The students to whom this organ-
ization will appeal are well marked
by Edward T. Devine in the introduc-
tion to "his new book, “The Spirit of
Social Work,” when he writes: “To
Social VVorkers, that is to every man

or woman, who in any relation of life,-

professional, industrial, political, edu-
cational or domestic; whether on sal-
ary or as a volunteer. whether on his
own individual account or as a part
of an organized movement, is working
consciously, according to his light in-
telligently, and according to his
strength persistently, for the promo-
tion of the common welfare-——the com--
mon welfare as distinctive from that
of a party or a class or a sect, or a
business interest, or a particular in-
stitution, or a family, or an individual.”

When this association gets under
way it will have a secretary who will
keep the students in touch with what

is being done in the various social and
philanthropic institutions of the city
and of the opportunities for service in
each one of them. lt is expected that
at the beginning of each university
year the association will issue a book-
let explaining its purposes and aims to
the new students.

CLASSICALS DEBATE.

Students Argue, Rights of Women at
Present and in Rome.

last Monday the feature of the pro-
gram was a debate upon the subject:
“Resolved, That the VVomen in Rome
at the Time of Cicero
Rights Than the Women of To-day
in the United States.” Misses Leh-
man and McIntosh upheld the afﬁrma-
tive, w'hile the negative speakers were
Gray Alter, ’13, and Horace Allison,
’14. The argument was marked by
much repartee; the ladies in the de-
bate were especially witty.

The debate attracted a one of the
largest crowds the Classical Club has
ever entertained and the members ex-
pressed the desire that a continuation
of the argument might take place at
the next meeting of the organization.
Several papers were also read upon
subjects of interest to the members of
the club. It was announced that the
next meeting will be held at the be-
ginning of the next term.
