Traditional

  Tap Day Held

Today at the annual Tap Day
ceremony distinguished students
received their highly deserving
recognition. The University of
,Pittsburgh displayed its formal

appreciation by honoring students
for service willingly rendered and
for outstanding scholastic ability.
Under the chairmanship of Doris
Deaktor Binstock, the 1945 Tap
Day ceremony will be remember-
ed as one of the most impressive
traditions at our university.

The dipping of the spoon rit-
ual has been a tradition at the
University of Pittsburgh for 73
ye.ars.~ Senior classes at Pitt have
publicly honored junior classes
by giving into their keeping the
historic wooden spoon, symbol of
achievement. The senior class rec-
ognizes 14 junior men and women
who have made outstanding con-
tributions to the university and
to their class through scholarship,
personality, and work in student
activities. To these persons known
as junior w-orthies, are given the
custody of the spoon. Each of the
awardees is given a box contain-
ing a silver replica of it, as,’ evi-
dence of the seniors, conﬁdence
and pride in; them. ’

Each year tap day is culminat-
ed with the awarding of the Sen-
ior Queen ritual. The Senior
‘Queen is a symbol. In choosing
one girl to receive the official
jcrown the members of the class
not only honor her as a person;
they also honor her in their own
personal attainments. They pay
tribute to her and through her to
their own ideal of what a woman
graduate of the University of
Pittsburgh should be.

"There -are many other honor-
aries on campus who select on this
. day those who have distinguished
themselves with qualities of char-
acter and. personality; for suc-
cess in academic studies and in
extra-curricular activities; and for
contribution to the life of the

, university. ‘

As dean Thyrsa Amos wrote,
“the whole rite invites one to the
life of the mind and of the spirit
to friendship, to social and civic
responsibility and to the ideals

A. of ﬁne youth. It speaks for Beauty,
Truth, an-d Goodness.’ It calls every

student to enrich life through his
own cultivation of these “Eternal
Verities.”

experience serving as background,
he entered Pitt and made a name
for himself as advertising man-
ager of the 1943 Owl, and then,
to climax it, was business man-
ager of the Pitt News in 1943-44

the past year. In addition to this
he has served on Student Con-

The Seventh War Loan Drive will be officially launched
May 14, but, for the colleges, it actually began early in April
with the advance Payroll Savings Campaign sales. By the end
of June, the nation hopes :to realize the $7,000,000,000 goal,
This drive is
the ﬁrst of two to be held this year and in both we must raise
almost as much money as in the three war loans last year.
Therefore we must greatly increase our efforts to fulﬁll this
vital home-front task. We owe an incalculable debt of grati-
tude to our ﬁghting forces; one of the most effective means of
expressing our poor thanks is through the purchase of these
bonds. It’s really a small repayment. We are merely asked
:to ﬁnance the war our men have to ﬁght. Today we see the
effects of our investment in war bonds. Germany totters on the
brink of a crushing defeat and her Nipponese ally, is slowly
following suit. But there is still a great deal to do before Japan
goes the way of her European counterpart. To relax now, even
a little, with victory so near, would be an inexcusable breach of
faith with our servicemen and women, who unfalteringly press

_ forward the issue of freedom in far-ﬂung troubled lands and

waters.

Funds are urgently needed for the making of new tanks,
guns, planes, trucks, rockets, and a host of other weapons with
which to overwhelm the foe and hasten the dawn of peace and
the return of our men. Money is required for care of the sick
and wounded and for veterans’ beneﬁts. Who could fail to
answer this appeal?

We have not suffered the ravages of war as many of the
other peoples of the earth have in the course of this conﬂict; our
country has not been devastated as many nations of Europe‘ and
Asia have been. We are serenely remote from the din of bat-
tles, the thunder of artillery, the screaming bombs, the stench
of blood and burned ﬂesh. Consequently, we sometimes tend,
not always conciously, to become complacent about the state of
thewar and irritated about our puny privations. That is just
what we must guard against! We must be ever mindful of the
burdens yet to be shouldered. There cannot be too much reiter-
ation of these points. Consider them thoughtfully.

The colleges and schools of the United States have pre-
viously shown how great a force they wield in marshalling aid
for war bond campaigns. A survey of the part played by edu-
cational institutions during the Sixth War Loan revealed some
very signiﬁcant facts regarding the value of student advertis-
ing in bond sales. 20,140,000 people were informed of that
drive by students; 11,130,000 were asked to buy bonds by stu-
dents; of these 3,180,000 were approached in no other way, and
1,595,000 bought extra bonds.in educational organizations. The
Treasury Department looks again to the universities and col-

V leges for such splendid support in putting over the top the cur-

rent Loan—and perhaps then some!

Just a week ago representatives of 46 United Nations con-
vened in San Francisco for the World Security Conference.
People the world over prayed for the success of that momentous
meeting. To give strength and meaning to our hopes, each one
of us may do 'his own personal planning for peace and -security
by buying regularly war bonds and stamps. They represent an
interest in the future, a better post-war world, a bulwark against
inﬂation now and later. 0

The photograph of the epic ﬂag-raising on Iwo Jima by a
group of Marines, with the slogan——NOW ALL TOGETHER—
is the most outstanding illustration of the Seventh War Loan.
The sight of those four men holding aloft the Stars and Stripes
on Mt. Suribachi symbolizes the united endeavor we must exert
here at home to accomplish our aims and render to the valorous
deeds of our men the heartening spirit of assurance and co-
operation.

We here at Pitt are certainly more than willing to con-
tribute toward the coming victory. The students and faculty
members of Pitt have usually responded enthusiastically in the
past to great causes. We shall not fail to heed the call this time!

NOW ALL TOGETHER!

/Qau[z4Ui@ku¢ﬂ&aw

By Deirdre Baird

(

Once upon a time a New Eng-
land girl mistook the ﬁrst mile-
stone from Boston for a tombstone,
and reading its inscription, “1 M
from Boston,” remarked, “‘I’m
from Boston’—how simple; how
suﬂ’i-cient!” Besides being an elo-
quent testimony to the smugness
of -one ‘small section,of the coun-
try, this incident is typi-cal of a
national, even international, inter-
est in tombstones.

In the ’90s there seems to have
ﬂourished a whole cult of senti-
mental travelers, who jogged
about the countryside from one
cemetery to another, copying ten-
der and uplifting expressions of
grief to preserve among the press-
ed violets in their Memory Books.
Close on their heels c-ame another
type of ghoul, shattering the
funeral silence with his raucous
laughter, and culling only the
ridiculous from the -sublime. To
the latter cl‘asrs of enthusiasts I am
indebted for this column.

There are two kinds of humor-
ous epitaphs, those which are
purposeful and those which are
accidental. To the ﬁrst classiﬁca-
tion belongs that famous rhyme
from B-ath Abbey:

“Here lies Ann Mann;

She lived. an old Maid
And she died an old Mann.”

Another old favorite is
“Here lies the body of Mary Ann,

Safe in the bosom of Abraham.
That’s very nice for Mary Ann,

But not so nice for Abraham!”

A variation of the same theme is
this whimsical couplet:

“Angus Mac-Pherson sleeps here
in the ground;

Don’t jingle money while walking
around.”

Slightly more difﬁcult to classi-
fy is the following arresting in-
scription:

“Here will lie
MR. JAMES JONES.
At present he lives and

Carries on his shoe business

at 150 Franklin Street."

But more hilarious by far are
those epitaph boners which are
patently accidental. For exam-
ple, this epitaph was inscribed
upon the tomb of a beloved mis-
sionary:

“He was shot by his attendant.
Well done, good and faithful
servan .”

On another -occa-sion, a widow
told the marble-cutter, “I want it
to say, ‘To my husband’, in an
appropriate place.” Need I explain
that when finished the stone read,
“To my husband, in an appropriate

place”? The next couplet illus-

trates a slip in logic common on

Irish tombstones:

“Here li-es John Thomas and his
children dear;

‘Two buried at Oswestry, and one
here.”

The funniest story of all, how-
ever, is about a Mr. Church, who,
in moving the remains of his four
wives to a new cemetery, got their
bones hopelessly mixed. His New
England conscience forced him to
procure new headstones, which
read:

“Here lies Hannah Church
And probably a portion of Emily.”
“Sacred to the memory of Emily

Church

Wheo seems to be mixed with
Matilda.”

“Stranger, pause and drop a
tear: '

For Emily Church lies buried here

Mixed in some perplexing
manner

With Mary, Matilda, and probably
Hannah.”

Letter To Editor

Editor’s note: We are re-print-
ing here two of the many kind let-
ters received following the edi-
torial on our late President, which
appeared in the April 18 issue.
Because that editorial was an ex-
pression of the emotions of the
average Pitt student, we feel that
all should share in its praise. And,
thanks again, to those who took
the time and bother to write the
News in regard to it.

* * *

Dear Miss Thomson:

All too frequently people read
an editorial, ﬁnd it appealing, de-
cide they ought to write a note
about it, and then do nothing
further. I have read all of your
editorials carefully. They are
deﬁnitely superior. Your editorial
on our late President compares
very favorably with those from all
over the country which have ap-
peared in the Congressional Rec-
ord.

Yours truly,
Asher Isaacs.

 

Among «the hundreds of tributes
paid to our late Pr-esident Frank-
lin D. Roosevelt, the one penned
by on-e o.f our own students, Miss
June Thomson, will, I am sure,
stand w-ell towards! the top. Of
the many which I have read, I
place that of Miss Thomson at the
head of the list. Her ﬁne choice
of words, her beauty of expres-
sion, the sincerity and depth of
her sympathy, her reaction to the

It’s the way a student has his
head bent over The Pitt News.
You see him leaning against the

bulletin board or sitting in one of .

the booths in the Tuck Shop. You
wonder how he thinks the paper
is put together, or whether he
even cares. ,
It’s a precise matter-.—getting
the paper out on schedulei; From
the editor to the cub reporter, peo-
ple work. No one sits around do-
ing nothing. In some issues, a re-
porter spends more time tracking
down a two-inch story than the
make-up editor does putting the
front page together. A reporter
has to contact busy people. He
can wait an hour for someone. He
can follow a person up and down,
ten ﬂoors of the Cathedral and see
him going around the corner and

never catch him. He has to hold

sentry outside doors, look, up
schedules, call offices. He can
start at 1 o’clock Friday and not
be able to bring the story in until
5 o’clock. ,

The editors spend all afternoon
Friday and Monday assigning and
checking news stories. Every
news story is re-read two and
three times; hours are devoted: to
writing headlines; pictures *are
measured and sent to the engrav-
/ers; ads are solicited and made up;
then copy is sent down to the prin-
ter Friday and Monday after-
noons.
columns and stories on “ga1leys”—-
sheets with printed copy for read-
ing of typographical errors. On
Tuesday, the editor and
members of the staff go down to
the printer to wait for the “proof
sheets.” These are the complete
pages of the paper, set up. Some-
times, stories have to be rear-
ranged. The editor can be with the
printers until 5 o’clock. .

And so it is that every Wednes-
day throughout the year (today is
an exception because of Spring
Festival) the students get their
school paper. It’s a strange feel-
ing to watch a Pitt News sliding
from the small pile of papers on
the stand. You see the boy or girl
fold it, and you wonder if he
knows how many, typewriters
ticked away in the eighth ﬂoor of-*
fice, how many eyes ran over
pages of copy, how many times an
editor or a reporter sat at the
phone to check the “one line he's
reading. You wonder and then
you stop wondering. You have a
class, and you exit fast.

This week we have a_ bird’s eye
View -of Pennsylvania State Col-
lege; The bird is Yyette Levine,
formerly a Pitt stud-ent, who ﬂew
into the Pitt News oﬂice to give
Us a few quick impressions of the
Penn State campus. A few ob-
servations have been contributed
by “Nate from State” Prashker,
C46.

"The center of all campus life is
the building, Old Main. It is de-
votedto the same purlposes as our
Commons room, except for the
rallies that take place at Old Main.
The Corner room, the local “inn,”
runs a close second to Old Main
in popularity as a meeting place.
The Corner room. has been c-om-
pared» to our Tuck shops, but it
has been agreed that the at-
mosphere in the Tuck shops is
much more friendly — a much
better place “to get to know peo-
ple.” (That’s heartening!)

' Since Penn State is isolated
from any large community, social
life must be conﬁned to the cam-
pus. Every Friday night, in the
Armory, informal dances "are held.
A vic provides the music. Fra-
ternities (46 of them) hold open
h'ouse every Saturday night. Then
there are big week-ends when
rformal dances are held in Recrea-
tion hall. For these dances,_ name

Wm,» ..--

I .

  
 

During the big week-ends, fra-
ternity parties and other affairs
are planned by individual groups.
Th-ose who are not interested in

dances can always go to the mov-
ies. ‘There are three movies. One
of them is -devoted completely to
Western double features. Box
lunche-s and peanuts may be eaten
between features!

As for student activities we
found that Penn State has strong
dramatic associations. There are
the Penn State players and the
Th-espians. In Old Main there is
a “Little Theater” where small
productions and rehearsals are
held. Llarger productions are held
in Schwab auditorium. Then there
are activities like Druids and Paru
Nu for athletes, and the Blue
Key, and Skull and Bones for
managers of teams and politicians.
That brings us to the political
parties. “The “Nittany” and the
“Key” are the two main parties on
campus‘. Before every election
there is campaigning —- posters,
speeches, and rallies. The night
before the election each party

That means combat telephone wires must be

laid down with every forward push. And com-

Fisher Speaks -

To Journalists

“Rewriting isn’t the soft job
that the name implies,” said Mr.
C. E. Fisher, assistant city editor
o.f the Post-Gazette, who spoke
to the journalism class last Thurs-
day.

‘Mr. Fisher listed ﬁve qualiﬁca-
tions necessary for the position
of re-write man: intelligence, in-
cluding a good memory and back-
ground; speed, the ability to type
out a story, and feed it to the
copy desk without giving it a
second glance; inquisitiveness,
spotting possible mistakes and
checking; the ability to angle a
story, giving a dull story life; and
last the ability to spell, getting the
word right most of the time, and
learning new words.

As the duties of the re-write
man, Mr. Fisher gave two: the
direction of reporters out on a
story, and the actual rewriting

An exciting feature of the cam-
paign ‘will be the awarding of
prizes to the two students who

Finance committee has planned
only two War Loan drives instead
of three. Pitt students are being
asked to contribute their share of

$7,-00-0,0=0'0,00'0-, of which $4,000,-
0=0-0,0v0~0- must be in “E” bonds
al-one. The speed of our ﬁnal
cleanup in Europe an-d the s-uc-
c-ess of the gigantic war still fac-
ing us in the Paciﬁc will depend
for the next six months upon the
success of the Seventh War Loan
drive. In the last drive, Pitt stu-
dents brought in $28,554.55 in war
bond pur-chases.

The latest frat news in general

is that several of the fraternities
have offered their houses to the
veterans club for their club meet‘-
ings until the vets have a perma-
nent meeting place. This is not
surprising in view of the fact that
a great number of veterans are
fraternity men. As was shown in
our serviceman’s edition, every
fraternity ‘on campus boasts at
‘least several vets.

This past week was the Phi Gam
work week which was in prepara-
tion for Fuoun«der’s day on May 4.
The Phi Gams are the ﬁrst frater-
nity on -campus to abolish hell
week, substituting a pledge work
week in its place.

The Delts’ Faculty Reception
with. Kappa Kappa Gamma was
held‘ at the Delt house on Friday,
April 27. It was a buffet dinner

‘ . affair with songs sung by both

frats as highlights of the evening.

Monday night all the Sigs went
to the Nixon to see Zasu Pitts in
“Ramshackle Inn.” The Sig quartet
is working on “Skyscraper Cap-
ers,” which from what I hear, is
going to be something super.

The Phi Kap’s are“ all ready for
Spring Festival. Yep, they’ve even
importing a hillbilly quartet for
the big bonﬁre Friday night.

Last Friday the SAE’s held a
dance for the Delta Zetas and
the Phi Gams. Monday night
Harry Anderson, Jim Staud, John
J acoby, and Al MacEllroy will be
initiated into the fraternity.

Eight men were initiated into
the Pi Lams last Sunday. Th-ose
honored were Fred Klein, Mar-
shal Levy, Bert Lipson, Stanley
(Joe) Pollack, Murray Zeilinger,

Schaefer.

Bob Lucchino, Bill Connolly,
Bill Wiant, James Ashtan, Sterling
Anderson, Jim Gittings, Mike Ma-
nesiotis, Al Kadar, and Lou Kish
completed hell week at the PiKA
house last Saturday night.

Last Friday the Phi Eps held a
dance in the ‘Civic Center room,
Webster hall. Ch-uck Marlyn’s
band was featured from 8:30 to
11:30 o’clock.

Spring, whether the weather
says so or not, is here according to
many women’s fraternities who
are picnicing regardless of the

Among such optimists were the
Zetas who held a picnic meeting in
‘Schenley park last Monday night.
The picnic was a success, but who
can say how‘ much business they
transacted!

Last Sunday the Thetas could be
found in South park having a pic-
nic to celebrate the initiation of
their pledges on Saturday. The
new Thetas are: Ginny Barker,
J-ackie Bowers, Gerry Collins,

Frances Crouse, Jeanne Eisman,

     

Pat Zinsser, Jo McGhee, Ginny
Riese, Lou Moore, Ann Mont-
gomery, M. C. Daum, Jayne Iams,
Patty Irons‘, Betty Jackson, and
Mary Maddox. After initiation the
chapter gave a banquet in honor
of the new members. On May 6
the girls will hold open house for
their parents.

New Tri Delt ofﬁcers are: pres-
ident, Phyllis Krelger; vice pres-
ident, D_. J . Jamison; recording
secretary, Marjorie Hamihton; cor-
responding secretary, Gloria Res-
sler; * treasurer, Lois Provan;
rushing chairman, Jean _Sch'orr;
chaplain, Vivienne Bartholy; and
historian, Elly Lynch. After Pan-
hellenic Ball the 'Tri Delts held
their traditional‘ Pansy Breakfast.
The entire chapter stayed at the
house overnight, and promptly at
7 o’clock the pledges served break-
fast to the actives.

Those TPA’s have been quite the
social butterﬂies lately. Last Wed-
nesday they held a tea dance at
their house for the PiKAs; on Sun-
day, in celebration of their
Founder’s day, April 30, Theta
Phi Alpha actives, pledges, and
alumni went to Mass, Commun-
ion at St. Paul’s cathedral, and
breakfast at the Schenley hotel.
Next Sunday they plan to initiate
six pledges after Communion
Breakfast at the Mayfair. The
new actives will be Mary Lucas,
Rosemary Dudley, Mary Ann Mc-
Quigan, Rita ‘Mary Bastyr, Cath-
erine Boyle, and Marie Adele Rea-
gan.

After the Ball, the Delta Zetas
gathered at Jackie Wilson’s home
for a- party.

Alpha. Epsilon Phi is celebrat-
ing its silver anniversary of
founding on Pitt campus with a
banquet at the Hotel Schenley on
Saturday. Many national oﬂicers,
alumnae, and honorary members
will be there for the occasion.

Recently the Kappas gave a
birthday party for their house-
mother. Last Friday they got to-
gether with the Delts to have a
Kappa-Delt tea for the faculty.

The Pitt and ‘Tech chapters of
Chi Omega were visited last week
by Mrs. Edna Earl Richardson,
their national visitor.

Beta Sigma Omicron has reor-
ganized its Mother’s club. The new
club held its ﬁrst meeting last
Thursday.

Last Sunday the Phi Sigs had a
tea dance for the Phi Eps, and re-
cently the Phi Sigma Sigma
Alumnae “let their hair down” at
a party they gave in honor of their
pledges.

Initiation for the Phi Mu pledges
took «place Monday night at the
Shadyside Presbyterian Church.

« British Captain

Interviewed By
Journalists

It’s not every day that two
members of Xylon, honorary jour-
nalism fraternity for women, in-
terview a British army captain.
Well, that’s what happened when
Carol Leffler and Signe Win-
stein heard Captain F. J . Collett,
M. C., address the Pittsburgh ad-
vertising club luncheon recently.

Stirred by the Captain’s real-
istic picture of ﬁghting in Burma,
the reporters remembered their
“nose for news” and realized that
here was a story. Tracing Captain
Collett to the British consulate,
Carol and Signe talked with him
about everything from India to
his home in Manchester, England.

At the luncheon the Captain told
of his fourteen months of combat
in Burma. The most dramatic part
of his talk was his description of
the siege of Kohima-; where his
unit was cut off and under ﬁre
for fourteen days. He was deco-
rated with the Military Cross after
his company had killed seventy
J aps with a loss of two men killed
a-nd twenty wounded. He praised
the perfect cooperation between
British ground troops and the
American air force which supplied
them. When he spoke of the Jap-
anese ﬁghting methods his voice
was grim and the muscle-s of his
face showed the intensity of his
feeling.

Later in the day, the Captain
visited the University. Asked his
-opinion of the ‘Cathedral he said,
“It’s quite wonderful. I’m looking
forward to the time when there
will be an English nationality room
among the others.”

New Books Added

ject matter present in the new

tray their sacred cause; American
Chronicle, the autobiography of
Ray Standard Baker, better known
to most readers by his nom de
plume, David Grayson; The Pri-
vate Life of the Master Race by
Bertote Brecht, -a vivid portrayal
of the spiritual horror and de-
gradation that is ‘bred by Fas-
cism; Seed of the Puritan, a n-ovel

New Program
Raises Status

Of Advisers

Iowa City, Ia.——‘(I.P.) Success
of the new program built around
the new liberal arts curriculum
depends on a comprehensive ad-
visory system, conceived to avoid
the former hit or miss method of
choosing courses, according to col-
lege ofﬁcials of the University of
Iowa.

Under the new system the ad-
viser ‘has been elevated from a
clerk in the College of Liberal
Arts who helps in ﬁlling out regis-
tration forms to a major factor in
the life of each student.

A freshman may declare his
major immediately, and an ad-
viser from the department chosen
will be assigned to him to help
plan intelligently a four-year
course best suited to his individ-
ual needs. The student who has
not yet selected a major ﬁeld
will ‘be assigned a general adviser
until he makes his decision. '’

In addition a special advisory
ofﬁce has been set up to facilitate
channeling of information from
various University services to the
adviser. When a student’s grades
go down, for example, it may be
due to ﬁnancial difﬁculty, a poor
housing situation, health or just
that the student can’t read effec-
tively enough to-keep up his class
work.

Keystone of the new program
lies in satisfying the student's
actual needs rather than in main-
taining a rigid set of requirements
that every student is expected to
fulﬁll. In addition the new sys-
tem sets up levels of competency
as a «basis for judging achievement
rather than the number of courses
taken or hours of credit earned.

Emphasis from now on will be
on moulding the curriculum to ﬁt
the individual. Goals will be
reached through increasing num-
bers of small classes, seminar
work, individual instruction, clinic
and laboratory work and teacher-
student conferences. \

was rapidly becoming as ‘big a
“character on campus” as ﬁrst
tenor, Bob Buell. Well, maybe not
quite as big.

Al claimed he hated the no-
toriety of it all: people calling on
him day and night, no privacy,
no time to philosophize, no time
for serious meditation. But don’t
let him kid you; he loved it. Just
think of it. Someone always bring-
ing him a chunk of Liederkranz

with drippings. Horw that little
rodent did beat the meat short-

plenty of new romance this week.
The dance, incidentally was a
huge success, according to the

‘Main problem of the evening
was, as usual, the curfew and
where to go after the dance. Gini
Volkay solved the problem by
holding openhouse for her Kappa
sisters and their dates. Nice for the
gals, but rough on the furniture.

From the winter quarters of the
Pitt Circus (May 2, 3, 4, 5—Re-

Something else we didn’t ﬁnd

Brown-haired, green-eyed Rita has been in this country since she

escaped with her family from Germany six years ago.

left the west side of Berlin, the section where all the big government
ofﬁces are, on April 20. 1939, the date of Hitler’s birthday.

As her family drove throughe
the streets about nine -o’clock in
the evening, the whole town was
brilliantly illuminated and thou-
sands of people were streamrng in-
to the city to hear Hitler’s ad-
dress through loudspeak-ers which
were set up at every point. Rita

 

 

still remembers the thousands of
black swastikas lining the streets
and the blac-k-garbed Gestapo
men who were swarming over the
neighborhood. Rita never heard
that birthday address. She and
her family sped away, and this
was her last glimpse of Berlin.
With a grin on her face, Rita
admits to having seen Hitler twice.
Her family was driving down Un-
ter den Linden and noticed SS
men in the street suddenly start
saluting. While they wondered,
Der Fuehrer’s sleek . jet car
streaked by with Hitler aboard.
The second time Rita saw Hit-
ler was at the Olympic games.
She was supposed to be one of
the representatives from her
school in the folk-dancing which
was scheduled. When the Nazis
discovered that her father was
Jewish she was not allowed to
participate. S-he did go to the
games, however, and heard Hitler
make a sp-eech of welcome. One
of the sights -at the games was the
miniature city that the Germans

Came across for those who
have gone across i

built near the game grounds ‘to

house the athletes. ‘Rita recalls ‘ 

gleaming rows of small white cot-

tages, all “the absolutely new-‘- I

est kind.” She remembers seeing

mans, who were very careful to‘.

associate with members of the ‘
white race only, Germans prefer-5
ably. 2 .

Rita considers her family to b
v-ery lucky. Her immediate family,
her father and mother, twin broth-
er, and herself, all escaped. Her
relatives are now scattered over
North Africa, South America, and
the United States.- Others were not
so forunate. Her grandfather Who
was eightly-four and her grand-
mother who was seventy-nine
were taken to a _ concentration
camp and were never heard of
thereafter. - i

Her family also escaped. the

worst part of the great persecu- 

tions of 193-8 when Gestapo men
went into every Jewish home and,
after beating up the men, took
them to concentration camps.
When three tough, huge Gestapo

men at least six-feet-four each,‘

strode into Rita’s home, her father
was absent. Rita thinks they must
have been too busy with other vic-
tims to return, for they never did.
The usual procedure was to break
into a home and ask for the man
of the family. If the wife refused
to give his whereabouts, she and
the children were taken to the
concentration camp. Otherwise,
just the man was taken. During‘
this period all businesses were
wrecked and looted.

Girls lead -a very different life‘ j ' 
in Germany, Rita declares. Careers ‘

do not interest them. A girl from a
respectable family does not go
out until she is about twenty. And
then, says Rita, shaking her head,
they don’t exa-ctly “go out.” Fam-
ily affairs are about the beginning
and end of social life. The Hitler
Youth organizations. are trying to
change all this. They have meet-
ings every night which the boys’
and girls’ organizations attend to
get acquainted. At all other
places girls are very heavily
chaperoned. Rita is very deﬁnitely
for “the American way.”

The idea of the Nazis and the A

German people being identical
doesn’t appeal to Rita. She feels
that only the poor, ignorant people
who had absolutely nothing really
want Hitler and support him.

tomorrow at Penn State with the

The Mitterling men have failed to

their an-cient rival.

Little is known about the Pan-
thers except that they are a green

comprise the veterans. The other
spots will be ﬁlled in by Clyde
Marsiglio at. ﬁrst, Don Delancey,

Tennis Dropped Here,
Another °War Casualty’ A

Tennis, last of the so-called

x “minor sports” at Pitt, has been

dropped.

After -weathering three seasons
under wartime conditions, univer-
sity athletic officials have decided
to abandon inter-collegiate com-
petition in the sport for this
spring.

In pre-war days, tennis, golf,
and track, together with baseball,
formed the backbone of a very
active spring athletic program.
After the declaration of war, when
all athletics were sharply cur-
tailed, the golf and track teams
managed to continue competition
for a season or two, and then
were forced to fade out because
of travel restrictions, difficulty in
obtaining equipment, inadequate
cova-cihilng, and lack of interest.
Tennis, however was a bit more
fortunate and manag-ed to hang
on until last season but now must
go the way of the others.

Tennis has a rich heritage at
this university. In the early part
of this century, when ‘we were
still W.'U.P., intramural tennis
tournaments among the men stu-
dents were held annually. Not
until 1912 did they enter into any
competition with neighboring
schools. In- that year a league was
formed with Pitt, Allegheny, Car-
negie Tech, Westminster, Wash-
Jeff, and Grove City.

Pitt won the league champion-
ship with 15 victories and 3 losses.
Since no funds had been set aside,
as yet, for maintenance of a ten-
nis team, no coach had been hired
but the aggregation was managed
by J. C. lVIacKrell, the top-seeded
netter. In the following years the

McEllroy, ran roughshod over
their opponents. The ex-Pitt cap-
tain -is now better known as Dr.
W. S. McEllroy, dean of the Uni-
versity medi-cal school. In his day
Dr. McEl1roy was rated a top net-
man and in 1914, while still in
school was runner-up in a na-
tional singles tournament.

‘In 1915 the Blue and Gold ob-
tained their first coach in the per-

then was named head coach. The
practice of having freshman ten-
nis -teams was inaugurated in 1920
and continued up until recently.
The Pan't‘h‘er teams in the late
’20s featured such tennis lumi-
naries as Dave and‘John O’Laugh-
lin, who are still rated among the
top players in this district today.

In 1930 Dr. M:cEll«roy assumed

standing netter in Pitt history.

In the late '30s the squad was
taken over by Dr. Dave O’Laugh-
lin and his teams gained consid-
erable success. One of his out-
standing men who captained the
team, was Joe Kristufek of Me-
Keesport, a highly touted district
netter. Last year the Pittmen were
handled by‘ assistant football
coach Charles “Doc” Hartwig.

Tennis has not died at Pitt. It
merely goes into hibernation till
after victory when it again ‘will
play a prominent part in Pitt ath-
letic policy.

Carlson’s Cuties Show
Up Well in Practices

By Larry Bondy
The first war-time spring bas-

ketball practice got under way at

4:30 o’clock, Monday, April 23rd
at the ‘S-tadium. A dozen players
answered Dr. Carlson’s cry and
were immediately put to work.
“Big Red” stressed conditioning
in his first workouts, with the
candidates going through the arm
and leg -exercises- of the fatigue
curve. Following through, the
boys were given a little skull prac-
tice, learning the professor’s con-
tinuities.

The doctor comes to his prac-
tices prepared: with enough plays
to keep the boys practicing all
year round. Numerous plays are
developed around one continuity
and some with two continuities.
Nate Apple, a regular from last
year’s team, believes if two con-
tinuities -can be learned that the
Panther win column will add up.

«Some members out from last
year’s Phantoms are Morrie Jacob-
sen, Nate Apple, and Ed Garnham.
Garnham saw very little action

last year but Nate Apple evened
up for ’ him. The little forward
played practically four quarters
in every contest and despite his
size he proved a big man in the
Pitt line-up.

Morrie Jacobsen, a six-footer
and a converted f-orward, saw ac-
tion in every encounter last sea-
son. Dr. Carlson used Morrie as
the starting center in most games
and would; call in Hank when the
sliding got extra tough. Morrie
and Hank teamed up in the last
Penn State battle in hopes of stop-
ping the -Staters onvtheir home
court, but the added extra Pan-
ther defensive pow-er failed. Hank
Zeller’s medical studies are keep-
ing him too busy to indulge in the
practice, while Sam Cons-entino is
out for the baseball ‘team and Carl
Michalic another player who is
still on campus expects to don -an
Uncle Sam uniform shortly and
therefore has called it quits. A
new arrival who looks good in
practice is Irv Schafer, a Taylor
Allderdice product. .

One Superman That Couldn’t Take It

In the early days of the war
when the German Army was over-
running -the Balkans and had cap-
tured the Island of Crete, one of
the German paratroopers cap-
tured by the Allies was Max
Schmeling.’

Schmeling was immediately pu.t
into a prisoner-of-war camp with
some of his Nazi buddies, Now
Max was quite a Superman, (so
he thought) in fact, better than the
average run-of-the-mill “Super-
men” and? in the camp he was
haughty and quite aloof from the
other prisoners.

For :a while Max was surly for
he had -boas-ted that no camp could

hold him. One day Max got to
talking with one of the guards,
still keeping that arrogant atti-
tude of his. Then the guard de-
cided to deﬂate this Super egoist
and asked him how he had gotten
a certain scar on his face. Before
Max could reply the guard sup-
plied his own answer——"Did you
getiit in your second ﬁght with
Joe Louis?” Schmeling became
enraged and made another dash
for freedom. The guard calmly
raised his riﬂe to his shoulder and
so ends our story.

6 The annual I-F swim and track

meets will be held as usual this
year during the Spring Festival.
The swimming meet 2 will take
place May 2 at 7:30 o’clock in
Trees gym pool. The track meet
is scheduled for the following
Thursday in the stadium at 2:30
o’clock. The Phi Delts won the
track meet last year while the
PiKA’s copped the swimming
meet.

Each fraternity will be allow-
in each of the meets except in the
relays. In these they will be lim-
ited to one team of 4 men. The
events for the swimming meet
are:

50-yard free style

50-yard backstroke

50-yard breast stroke

150-yard medley relay

200-yard free style relay

The events for the track meet
will be:

50-yard dash

100-yard dash

220-yard dash

440-yard relay

The winning team and runner
up in each event will receive the
same number of points toward the
All-Point trophy as they would
have received in football and
basketball.

The interfraternity ping pong
title has been decided with the Pi
Lams running off with the laurels.
They took it in championship style
without losing a match. The ﬁnal
standings for the rest of the fra-
ternities haven’t been announced

By Ed Citron, Sports Editor

There hasn’t been a Wo1*ld Series in Pittsburgh since 1927.
That was the last time that the pennant ﬂuttered from the ﬂag-
pole in the Oakland Orchard. It’s been a long time, eighteen
years to be exact, and despite their early slipshod performances,

this may be the Pirates’ year.

The Cards, Cubs, and Giants shape up as offering the most

opposition.

The Cards, however, have lost Walker Cooper,

peer of catchers, have Slats Marion on the bench with an ankle
injury, and are on the outs with fork-baller Mort Cooper,

twenity-ga-me winner for the 1ast¢

two years. The Giants have been
piling up wins and .they’ll count
plenty, but it’s been mainly at the
expense of the weak sisters of the
league, the Phillies, Dodgers, and
Braves. The Cubs, termed a dark-
horse in spring training, have
been clipping along in great fash-
ion un-der Chipper Cholly Grimm.
They've got Stan Hack back to
steady their inﬁeld, Billy Nichol-
son to lead the attack, and Oom
Paul Derringer again winning ball
games to round -out a fairly well-
balanced pit-ch-ing staff. But they’re
a shade below the Bucs in power
and all-around class. ‘

The Pirrates -stand an excellent
chance of winning, if they play
the kind of ball they’re capable of.
lt’s generally conceded that they’re
the best hitting club in the cir-
cuit, have about as well-rounded
pitching staff as can be found
these days, and are only a li-ttle
shy on the ﬁelding, especially at
shortstop and -second aro-und the
pivot po-st. However, their punch
at the plate counter-balances this.

Frankie Frisch has been skipper
of the Pirate ark since 1940. If the

Buccos fail to grab the pennant’

this year, it’s unlikely that they'll
t-ake one in the near future. They
are not an outstanding aggrega-
tion, but are perhaps comparable
to the American League champs
of last year, the Brownies. They’re
a one—year team . . . either they
do it this season or they’ll be
pennant-hungry for some ti-me to
come. They’re not like the Car-
dinals, young, fast, powerful, with
replacement-s always pouring in—<
they can’t come back year after
year and burn up the league.
Pittsburgh’s got to do it this year.

If the Corsairs fail to come
through, it’.s not unlikely that
there’1l have to be some scape-
goat. T-his is purely speculative,
bu-t Frankie Frish may not be
steering the Bucco craft come
1946, if .there’s no World Series
at Forbes Fi-el-d next October. And
to again give a qui-ck look at the
old crystal ball, if the “Fordham
Flash” passes out of the picture,
keep an eye on Senor Al Lopez.
He’s a possibility, IF the Pirates
ﬂounder in this year’s pennant
chase.

Veterans Nominate it

After keeping company with the
moth.balls for over a year, this
column is at last being revived.
Our aim is to infonm everyone of
the doings of the most “exclusive”
group in -the university, the en-
gineers. As, for you readers that
are engineers, keep in touch with
this column to get the real low
down on your school from those
who pretend to know.

The most important contribu-
tion from the hill to campus life
in many a moon was naturally the
Engineering and Mines dan-ce. Al-
though tentatively scheduled for
earlier in the semester it was ﬁn-
ally held at the main ballroom of
the William Penn hoctel, Wednes-
day night, April 18. Since the
dance was a midweek affair, the
attendance was not :too l-arge;
however, those attending agreed
that it was one of the best dances
of the school year. The novelty of
having two orchestras providing
continuous music proved to be
the highlight of the dance.

Chairman Tom Vasilaros and
attractive Isobel Peterson led the
dance, while Greg Betz and Jackie
Bowers went through some weird
jitterbugging steps. Other out-
standing «couples were “Handsome
Dick” Hargraves with Nancy Drol—
linger and Phil Kedizon with
Marion Donahue, while Jack
Garnham esconted. June Thom-
son. “Constant Nymph” Ferguson
