Ukranian Genocide

Ukranians Remember Famine

BY WES COTTER

ln I933, approximately 7 million
people died in the Ukraine. An easy
way for the Soviet Union to elimi-
nate the Ukrainian people — both
culturally and politically — was to
take their food away.

The genocide of the Ukrainepeo-
ple has not received much historical
attention, but a symposium held at
Pitt’s Frick Fine Arts Building Sat-
urday has helped Pittsburgh become
aware of what really happened;

The symposium, entitled “Geno-

cide in Ukraine,” was held in con-
junction with a weekend of events
aimed at calling attention to the
plight of Ukrainians. A memorial
march yesterday went from Shenley
Park to Soldiers and Sailors Hall,
where a service followed. The week-
end_’s events were held to commemo-
rate the 50th aniversary of the 7
million who died.
. The symposium featured Dr.
James Mace, a post-doctoral fellow
in history from the University of
Michigan. At a press conference Fri-
day, Mace said, “I think the
Ukraines want people to know what
happened to them.”

Mace outlined how, in l933, mil-
lions of people were forced into star-
vation through a deliberately

Blacks Making

By PAM cvoavmus

Student Government Board
(SGB) elections are just around the
corner, and voters are in for as few
surprises. ’

According to Black Action
Society (BAS) president Daryl
Davis, there are seven prospective
black candidatesmunning for SGB
offices this year so far. Candidates’
petitions must be in today by 5 p.m.

This equals the total number of
blacks that have run since 1977. The
last black elected president of SGB
was Bernie Payne in 1977, and there
have been only three blacks elected
to the board since then.

“I have definitely made an all-out
effort to get people to run,” Davis
said. The prospective candidates,
according to Davis, are a “solid

conceived famine. A million and a
half tons of grain was taken away
from the people and exported for
hard currency, which in turn was
used to further Soviet industrializa-
tion. ‘A

“If the grain wouldn't have been
exported, people wouldn't have
died,” Mace said. He went on to
explain that the Ukraine people
were non-communist and a political
problem for the Soviet government,
so they were destroyed.

Mace recalled how literally every-
thing was taken out of villages;
nearly every shred of Ukraine cul-
ture was destroyed.

J oseph Stalin, the Soviet leader at
the time, made sure that the destruc-
tion was complete, involving all pol-
itical, church and arts related
aspects of the Ukraine culture.

Dr. Bohdan Bociurkiw of
Carleton University, Ontario, and
an internationally-known expert
and author on Soviet religious pol-
icy, also spoke at the symposium.

Bociurkiw said that the Soviets
went so far as to destroy Ukraine
churches that dated back to l_l00 in

their attempt to crush Urkraine reli— ‘

gion and heritage.
Bociurkiw read accounts from
people who wrote about the tragedy

group.”‘All are very qualified, and
according to Davis, are academic
students, have leadership qualities
and belongto some type of service
organization.

The reason for more black invol-
vement this year, Davis said, was
because of his “encouragement.” He
looked forblacks who were quali-
tied for the positions and said, “Hey,
you can make a difference."

“We are definitely going to be a
force in the next election,” Davis
said.

There are three requirements for
candidates’ running for SGB posi-
tions. Candidates must have an
overall QPA of 2.5, they must have
petitions with 100 signatures if run-
ning for a board position and 150

signatures if running for president, '

and they must have one year remain-

With the exception of women,
minority representation in SGB has
been minimal in the past. No foreign
students have run for SGB in the
past seven years.

Giangarlo said that she would like

to see more participation by minor-

ity students in SGB.

“As an administrator, it is impor-
tant to see the SGB by representative
of the campus.”

These ‘ ﬁgures promise just as
much competition in the upcoming
elections as last year’s. That cam-

Could you use an extra $1,000
this weekend? It would take only
a few hours of your time, but it
could land you a job that would
last a lifetime. Even better, you
will be an international superstar
overnight. How do you make
this dream come true? It's simple.
Just prove your psychic abilities
to an inquisitive group called the
Paranormal Investigating Com-
mittee of Pittsburgh (PICP).

Founded in January of 1983,
this group has attempted to dam-
age the credibility of the world of ‘
psychic phenomena. Through‘
radio broadcasts, aired across
the nation, the Paranormal
Investigating Committee has
waged a mobile assault on the
claims of the immortal world.
Now recognized as a. leading_
investigative group, they have
issued a $1,000 challenge to
either prove every self-
proclaimed psychic is fraudulent
or help any shy person with real

Psychics Challenged to Prove Powers

supernatural powers to reveal
himself. ’

Richard Busch, founder and
chairman of the group explained
the origin of the group and how
this apathy for the “psychic”

q world grew.

“I had just seen too many tele-
vision shows with fake psychics,” ‘
Busch said. “I had read too many
stories and reports of psychics. I
just got sick of people's pro-
claiming themselves as psychics.
There had to be other people like
me around, so I began calling
[universities] and found a
number of people interested in
investigating the claims of
psychics.”

A magician-hypnotist-
mentalist, Busch said he knows
the secret behind which any fake
psychic might hide. He currently
holds the title of “Magician of
the Year” for the “International

Brotherhood of Magicians.”

This title has caused some trick
psychics to go into hiding when
the group has come to call.

Because Busch is using most psy-
chic tricks in his own act, he said ,
it’s hard to get by him using the
same materials.

Having called several universi-
ties, he was able to recruit many
professors with doctorates in.

“They aren't interested
in scientific investiga-
tions because they
themselves are not
scientific."

fields needed to aid the group
during the investigations. He was
able to get 12 active volunteers
for the committee.

Several members come from
Pitt. Among them are Dr. Mark
King, of the university's child
development center; Dr. Donald

Profile:

 Jim Raymond,
I BAS Adviser

By NANCY POPKIN

Assistant Director of Student
‘Activities James Raymond came to
Pitt from Duquesne University for
the opportunity to work with a
larger_and more diversified student
body.

At Duquesne, Raymond served as
the director of student activities and
__worked with all student groups in an
unspecialized way.

Here, he is able to work with stu-
‘dents on a one-on-one basis as the
adviser to the Black Action Society,
adviser to the Collegeiof General
St_udies students and administrator
in charge of recognizing and regis-
_tering non-Greek groups. t‘

- Raymond feels that the challenge

.,of his position is to get non-

traditional students through the sys-
tem. He believes that night students,
who come for short-term education,
and their organizations see them-
selves as separate from the rest of the
student groups. He hopes to bring
academics and organizations
together for these students and to get
more people involved.
Raymond sees the problems of

‘ black students as being similar to

those of CGS students. As a minor-
V ity. group on a predominantly white

campus, he feels black students must
realize common goals.

But, he sees a more positive racial
atmosphere at Pitt than at
‘Duquesne. The black students want
to become more involved on cam-
pus, and the student groups promote
involvement, but they aren't meeting
each other‘s needs, according to
Raymond. .

Part of the problem, he believes, is
that most student leaders are white
and that they attract people like
themselves to participate in student
organizations. He calls this mirror
involvement.

Raymond believes that if black

students learn to reach out and
change things on the campus, they
will be able to do it off campus as
well.
, “The opportunities are available
now; the door is open,” Raymond
said. “What you have to do is put
your foot in it."

He doesn’t believe campus issues,

racial or non-racial, are much differ-

ent than those when he was”an
undergraduate at Duquesne. It’s just
that“ there are continually new ways
to look at old problems."

When Raymond came to Pitt,‘he
knew Terry Milani and Andy Smith,
associate director and director of

to talk with a student.
student activities, respectively. But,
he didn't know the systemat all.

Raymond said he has had no
problems being one of the few blacks
in the Pitt administration.

“I am pleased to see so many black
faces,” Raymond said. A

He also added that the number of
foreign students, faculty and staff
also pleases him. He believes that
options are opened to fit the situa-
tion at Pitt. But, he said, there is
always room for improvement. So
far, he said, the administration has
been very receptive to new ideas and
is ready for_some changes.

One of those changes he has
undertaken will require all non-
Greek campus organizations to reg-
ister through the Office of Student
Activities instead of the Student
Government Board. Those groups
will file constitutions with Raymond
and notify him of any changes. And,
through his office, academic depart-
ments will be able to recognize these
groups. ~

Jan. 4, 1984, is the target date for
the project to be completed. Ray-
mond made similar changes in pol-
icy at Duquesne where it took
almost two years to complete.

Mace compared the Ukraine pol-
icy of 1933 to the current policy in
Poland. _ . '

The policy of destruction that was
iirected toward Ukrainian culture
also took a heavy toll on its writers.
According to Mace, there were 259
writers in l930 but onlyt36 in 1938.

“Eighty-five percent of the writers
were silenced,” Mace said, “either
shot or sent to the Gulog.”

This, coupled with stiﬂing of
information, left the Ukraine with
no recorded history from 1934 until
World War II.

“They broke the Ukrainians and
made money,” Mace said when
asked if the Soviets were successful.

One of Stalin’s policies at this time
was collectivization of farms, and
according to Mace, a million land-
holders were either sent to Siberia or
killed in the carrying out of this

- policy.

«I,

The total number of people who
died in the famine is not agreed
upon. Russian ofﬁcals have said off
the record that as many as 10 million
died,.while others, such as Mace, put

‘ Mace said-the numbers given by
authorities such . as the German
government, which had four embas-
sies_in the Ukraine, is probably more
accurate. The Germans estimated
the deaths at somewhere over 7
million. ' ' '

Both America and Great Britain
received accurate information on

S the extent of the famine but ignored

m

Marco Carynnyk, a visiting fellow
from the Kennan Institute in
Washington, D.C., said, “We were
quite well informed, but when
groups appealed for help it was an
‘alleged famine.-’ We preferred to
continue trading with the USSR...
they valued [trade] more than the

‘human life," Carynnyk said

Observations will be held all over
the country to bring attention to the
famine and its anniversary. Accord-
ing to Mace, it is one of the few
examples of genocide in the twen-
tieth century. Mace summed up the
situation by saying, “The Soviets
tried to get a final answer to this
self-assertive people within the
USSR.”

peak in the 1980s with these players.

A large portion of the criticism came from Pitt
students themselves who, for the past- three or _
four years, have seen some great football played
at Pitt Stadium. In addition, they watched Pitt in

All This  And Shadyside ll?

three bowl games in as many years — the Gator
Bowl, the Sugar Bowl and the Cotton Bowl. ‘
Needless to say, Pitt fans have been spoiled.
‘Yet, all Pitt students whoattended Saturday’s
game in Pitt Stadium should now be patting
themselves on the back for the great job they did
as the 12th ‘man. ' i
Pitt students really came out and showed their A
support for their team and shouldbe proud of the
job they did at a time when the Panthers really

. need it. After their loss to West Virginia last

week, morale had to have been low. The show of
support Pitt students exhibited Saturday must
have been a great boostfor the Panthers.

In a time when people constantly talk and write
about “the apathy of today’s college students,” it
is refreshing to see that Pitt students do care
about something, no matter if it’s a demonstra-
tion against the state of world affairs or just an
exciting football game.

Although the majority of the 1982 and 1983
bowl teams have gone on to bigger and better
things, Pitt fans showed they care about their_
team no matter who is playing or what type of
season it is.

Nobody can really say if Saturday’s crowd -
the majority of which spent the whole second half
on its feet — had an effect on Pitt__’s win. It would
be nice to think that we did, although the players
themselves did have something to do with it.

Saturday, Pitt students were at their best. They
gave support, vocalized it and showed that they

. are proud of their school.

Great job, Pitt fans!

Used to be that the best seat at the
movies in this town was 12 rows
back at the Warner Theatre. Now
that vantage point can be had as
easily as walking _ down Forbes
Avenue. The back wall of the theater
has disappeared, so have the red
velvet seats and the ornate chande-
liers. The stage curtain has been left
hanging in the rubble, covered in
lime dust and disrespect.

Old theaters die easily in the name
of urban redevelopment. Defense
for the Warner's destruction has
come in the form of big money and
the promise to replace the theater
with a shopping mall — one of those
vertical attempts at attracting
shoppers back into the city. There
has even been talk of racquetball
courts, the quiche and chablis set’s
ultimate urban playground.

Development,‘ as it’s defined these
days, requires only that you take" a
memorable structure, gut its inside
and then fill it with useless shops and
plenty of brass railings, hardwood
floors and green plants. That move-
ment is hardly reserved for the
downtown area. The disease can be
seen spreading like a‘ rash up Fifth
Avenue, and splotches of it have
broken out around Oakland.

The lower hill area of Fifth
Avenue is experiencing a particu-
larly intense phase of urban redevel-

. opment —— old store fronts are being

exchanged» for law offices, and
brassy and glassy new watering
holes have begun cropping up. Plans
call for more of the same, especially

as the DeBartolo empire begins to .

develop the area around the Civic
Arena. Along with all the cosmetic
improvements of such development
lies the problem of gentriﬁcation.
The residents of the area, mostly
poor, mostly black, can do little
more than sit and watch the tides of

Oakland is undergoing a phase of
urban redevelopment of its own, and
while the problem of gentriﬁcation
may not be as great, the motives
behind it, nevertheless, can be ques-

tioned. Oakland has, _for many,

years, played the ugly stepsister to
neighboring Shadyside —— that part
of the world where the grass grows a
little greener and the drinks are
poured a little stronger. Now, it
seems as if Oakland wants to join in
the fun, but does the slipper fit?

A good measure of a community’s
pretentions is the number of shops

 

 

devoted to useless children's gifts

and clothing, items that no conscien- .

tious parent would ever buy.
Another is the breaking of signifi-
cant price barriers, especially the $1
dollar a scoop ice cream cone. South
Craig Street, being the front line of
defense between here and the good
life, began redeveloping first, and
shoppers down there can now find
all the gifts a child would never
want, not to mention a frozen des-
sert at $1-plus a scoop. Can you

crosepown Facilities  
Until Vandals Are Caught

Dear Editor:

Once more, the students of this
university have proven them- i
‘selves unable to keep a school-

owned/student-used facility *
from being brutally damaged by
one of their own membership.
Admittedly, a small percentage
of their population may be con-
sidered criminally minded or at
least still at the level of commit-
ting childish pranks, but it only
_ takes one ofthem to do the harm.

After all the trouble and
expense that was, put into
improving the former student
union to what it is presently. it
shames me to be considered a
member of the student
population.

‘ room, as an incentive to bring

Although it may seem cruel on
the surface, the only approach to
this incident is to close down
those facilities in the union that
the majority of the students use,
including thesoon-to-open TV

forth to the proper authorities
the vandals guilty of this crime. I
assume that ‘ the honest and
blameless population could. live
without the recreation and TV
rooms until the guilty parties are
captured, charged and forced to
pay for the damage they have
caused as well as make a public
apology to the university.
I would consider this fair_ to all
concerned ‘

Recent “developments” around

There is now both a “homemade” ice

opening sometime after the first of

fashionable diners ignoring below-
zero temperatures to indulge in
double-chocolate chip.

Dorm Student Bothered

By ‘Sing-A-Longs’

Dear Editor:

First of all,‘ I would like to thank
Jason Pastrick for his letter on sor-

‘ orities who “conduct, songfests and-

sing—a-longs” in the Quad. Mr. Pas-
trick put into words what. I, my
"roommates and several other people
whom I know think and feel. We can
hear everything that goes on at those

‘ “sing-a-longs,” even with our win-

dows closed. _Where are your
manners, girls? Did you forget to
bring them with you when you came
to school?

Secondly, I realize there will be a
din created by Mr. Pastrick’s letter

' as.there was for Todd Erkel’s elo-

quent article (which I and several of
my friends thoroughly enjoyed). I
could not believe the commotion
that was caused by Todd Erkel’s
commentary. Are themembers of

' the fraternities and sororities so

as

insecure that they can not take any
criticism? And why should they be
so defensive about what Todd Erkel

wrote if there was not some truth in
it? I personally’ have _ no interest
whatsoever injoining a sorority, and
I would not allow myself to be
degraded by people who do not have
what it takes to stand on their own
two feet in college and dare to be
different. ' "

I and'many_other people are here
at Pitt to get an education, not to
listen to a group of girls singing
highly uncreative, repetitious songs
that do nothing for furthering one’s
musical education. These songs -also
hinder one’s education when it dis-
rupts their studying. So, to all soror-
ities who feel this incredible urge to
sing these songs in the Quad when
normal people are studying: Have a
heart! We do not like your singing,
and we do not want to hear it! We
would never make youendure listen-
ing to ours!

Dear Editor:
I am writing in response to Mark
Sindler’s article on October 3 in The

_ Pitt News. I am a member of the Pitt

Band and feel that I must comment
on some’ of Mark Sindler’s mislead-
ing remarks about the band. He
made some accurate observations
about the WVU fans; they really do
support their Mountaineers and
anything associated with the univer-

\ sity. Also, the WVU band is one of

the best in the country, especially
since it’s made up mostly of music
majors who receive up to three cred-
its each term for marching band.
The band also has the support of the
WVU fans, who cheer on their
Mountaineer band since it repre-
sents their university.

The Pitt Band has also become
one of the best, although‘ we have
few, if any, music majors and only
receive one half credit per term; we
march because we enjoy it, and
because it’s our way of showing our
support of the university. -

Every. halftime, the Pitt band has
a new show with different music, dif-
ferent drills and ‘different forma-

Writer Has No Loyalty To Pitt  

Dear Editor;
I would like to ‘say a few words to

one of the sports editors, Mark A.

Sindler, pertaining to his article
“From Killer Mascot To Killer Bal-
loons” that appeared in The Pitt
News on Oct. 3, 1983.

Mr. Sindler, as I read through
your article, I thought it was cute t-he
way you ‘talked about the WVU
mascot, the signs hung throughout
the stadium and the important mes-

sage to Pitt fans about the way WVU .

fans supported their team. Pitt is a
young, rebuilding team and needs
support from the students'to help
them win. - 7

But your article took on a sour
note, if you’ll pardon the pun, when
you started talking about the band.
“The Panthers were not the only
ones putting on a bad show...,”“The
marching band again paled in com-
parision tothe enemy opposition.”
According to your article, you didn’t
see the half-time show; all you saw
was the pre-game show. PUTTING
ON A BAD SHOW: maybe you
should re-read the part of your arti-
cle on loyalty! And as for your com-

Dear Editor:

This is but one of undoubtedly
many letters that have been written,
or are being written, to The Pitt
News. It concerns an article by Mark
Sindler in the Oct. 3 issue, the one in
which Mr. Sindler seemingly began
writing about the football team and
the WVU game but suddenly
changed direction and lashed out at
the Pitt Band with a full arsenal of

' verbal weapons.

What I would like to know 1S,
what kind of omniscient authority is
Mark Sindler that he can say what

‘he did. I ask you, Mark, do you

know exactly what being a band-
member involves? Do you know
about the hard work in preparing a
show (for the entertainment ever
recall seeing you at rehearsal,
marching in the freezing_rain, or at.
Pitt Stadium at 4 in the morning to ‘
travel to a football game.

tion was dull, that_ we did it too.

tions. We spend at least two hours
three nights a week and Saturday
morning to perfect these shows. This
part of our marching program is to
entertain the fans‘. The WVU pro-
gram ~(not the halftime show, as
erroneously reported by Mark
Sindler) uses the same “alignments”
each year, as most bands, including
Pitt, do. The WVU pregame goes
into a West Virginia border each
year, and the Pitt pregame goes into
a script, or longhand, -Pitt
formation.

Think about it; the Pennsylvania-
border wouldn't be too exciting or ‘

unique to look at. The script Pitt
formation is part of a tradition; it’s
something to get the fans fired up
about. If we don‘t get the response
the WVU band gets, take into con-
sideration the response of the fans to
the Pitt football team and make the
comparison ot the WVU fans’
response, and it will become more
obvious that it’s an overall effect of
West Virginia's being 100 percent
behind their university.

I would like to ask Mark Sindler

' and -the rest of The Pitt News staff

parison of the bands, you didn't care
to mention the facts. The fact is that,
in numbers, the Pitt band is march-
ing in the neighborhood of 210
members while WVU is in the neigh-

~ borhood of 350 playing members,

silks, etc. Also, you didn't mention
the fact that the Pitt band is made up’
of volunteers who gladly give their
time and effort in rallying up sup-
port for the team before the game,
after the game and, of course, during
the game. The reason I mention that
is because the Pitt band only has one
music major while the WVU band is
basically composed of music majors.

And as for your comment pertain-
ing to the script “Pitt,” “...how often
do we have to look "forward to the
same old alignment of the band
members...,’’ “It’s dull." Well, what
would you like us to spell, .Mr.
‘Sindler? “U of P,” “Oakland” or
maybe even “PSU”? Come on, Mr.
Sindler, not only are we showing the
nation that we are Pitt, but it’s a
tradition. And I didn’t hear any bad
remarks about WVU’s outline of
West Virginia in your article. )id

often. Well, Mr. Sindler, do you
know how new‘ WVU’s pre-game
show is? Maybe you should ask
around. You’ll be in for a surprise.
Besides, this just shows how much

‘ pride'and spirit you have for your

university. The script “Pitt” is a
showing of that pride, designed (suc-
cessfully, I might add) to invigorate
and excite all those associated with
the team and the university on game
day.

This letter may seem like nothing
more than an attack on a single wri-
-ter. The fact is, it is a response from
one individual to but one in what
appears to be a continuing series of
blatant acts of irresponsible journal-
ism. Were I a judge, I would be
forced to condemn The Pitt News
for first-degree yellow journalism
and premeditated antagonism and
to decree as sentence banishment
forever from the university. Not
only the band, but the football team
as well, has been insulted by Mark

Sindler’s article. They played a good
game. If, Mark Sindler, you think

And back home at.Pitt, when-we go

Proving Psychic ’s Power 5

McBurney, psychology; and Dr.

_Ezra Newman, physics and

astronomy.

The group coordinates its
efforts to one common objective,
* “to observe active demonstra-
‘ tions and to offer scientiﬁc

"explanation or validation to psy-
chics in hopes of separating truth

from fiction,” according to
Busch.

The group claims to be very
“anti-fraudulent." Dozens “of
well-known psychics have been
asked to submit to the group’s
testing but less than 10 percent
have replied, according to Busch.

“They aren't interested in
scientific investigations because
they themselves are not scien-
tific," he said.

Even those who have come

, forward often sidestep being
. called fake by claiming the panel

as a worthless composium
intended to try and draw the
members it. to the truth of psy-

This excuse holds up quite well

in the eye of the public, accord- _

ing to— Newman.

Newman said that a man
named John Taylor has a group
that is very pro-psychic. In
return, most of the resultsfrom
the group he leads tend to find
the investigated person very cap-
able of psychic phenomenon.

One of the most recent to fall
was Yuri Geller. Geller was a
nationally-known psychic who
fooled many university-
sponsored investigating commit-
tees. He was also able togain the
approval of the pro-psychic
groups. However, he soon found
himself repeating his abilities
and not being able to come up
with new powers for his mass
following.

Eventually his actions were
reproduced by notable magi-
cians, and his fame died as
quickly as it had grown. Still, he
remains a prime example of how

chic phenomenon_ the public can be overwhelmed

by a little genius and be swayed
at the whim of a common actor,
McBurney said. ‘

“People don't understand pro-
babilities and statistics; too
often, [psychics] pick a simple
answer,” he said. “Simple
answers are often wrong.”

Thus psychic materials like
zodiacs and tarot cards only

work for those who believe in -

them. If a zodiac does not fit a
day’s occurrences, often an indi-
vidual will look for any tiny thing
that might fill the space. The
belief in universal starmovement
affecting one‘s sex life is purely a
derision of a hard-up psychic try-
ing to inﬂuence theibar circuits to
explode in a mad frenzy.

Newman gave a bit of advice
for those who tend to lean
toward the world of psychic
phenomonon.

“Make skeptical inquiries, '

look at the hits and misses of the
predictors. People should be
more skeptical and not fooled by
tricks,” he said.

Night School, Right School for Students

are attending night classes. They are

7 the CGS students, the students who

come out at night.
"The College of General Studies
(CGS) was begun in I958 as the

T School of General Studies. lt was

created by the Board of Trustees in
an effort to meet the educational

' needs of adults in the community.

The majority of its students are

madeup of persons who have .

assumed work or family responsibli-

lties but at the same time wish to

pursue a higher education. I
CGS uses the same facilities as the

Program.

The majority of the students
attend school part-time, but many of
them carry full credit loads. While‘
the ages ofits students range from 17
to 70, about half of those admitted
each year are between 17 and 24.

Jan Robbins, a 21-year-old part-

time worker, carries 15 credits and is
majoring in administration ofjustice
(AJ). She feels that the CGS pro-
gram meets her needs in several
ways. .
V “The s5hool offers one of the best
A} programs in the country," Rob-
bins said, “with many of its students
actually being in the criminaljustice
system. I can also work my part-time
job in Shadyside while still remain-
ing an active student.” ’

Whether you want to be a full- or
part—time student, work toward a-
degree or job placement, orlmerely
take courses for personal enrich-
ment, CGS has a spot for you.

The college offers six study pro-
grams that are grouped in four main
areas ofconcern: 28 degree majors,
such as public administration and
legal studies; nine courses to prepare
for application to other university
schools, including elementary edu-
cation and engineering; 22 general
areas of study, such as classics and
theater arts; and ten non-degree cer-

CGS is the Student Government
Council (SGC). The SGC is com-
prised of a president’ and four
members, who are elected each year
during the winter term by full- and
part—time CGS students.

The Council advises members of
the university community on mat-
ters of student interest, coordinates
a number of student activities and
services and is responsible for the
allocation of student activity fees.

Nancy Belli, a CGS representa-
tivc, said she believes the council is
very effective in motivating the stu-
dents, even though most of their
time is spent off-campus and
commuting.

‘‘If for some students, our assis-

tance only goes as far as securing a
tootball ticket or a parking permit,
we feel we have helped them out,”
she said. “They are busy with other

things, but we still want to have

things for them when they need it.”
' There are 19 different services
offered by SGC, including a lecture
series, a notary public, parking per-
mits, a used-book exchange and an.
information line. The Council also
publishes its own newspaper, The
Night Times, and has seven officially
recognized student organizations.

-Beyond merely catering to the
working and .family class students,
CGS is also open to the rest of the
students within the university. Many
times, CAS students will take CGS
courses when the day classes are
closed or not available.“

CAS students can take as many

CGS courses as they want, but only '

up to twelve of these credits will be
counted towards the 120-credit:
requirement for graduation.

It also happens that CGS courses
are cross-listed with CAS courses;

thus, they can be registered under I

either school.

The College of “General” Studies
appears to be more speciﬁc than
most people are led to believe. Its
program is designed to accommo-
date practically every type of student
imaginable. So, ifthe sun hurts your
eyes, you can always become one of
those students who come out at
night.

 

The Sisters of
  Alpha Delta Pi  
would like to congratulate
  our new initiates

,5/Libraries Go Plastic

By CHELLE J. HRITZ

Plastic money vs. cash; that battle
took on a nevi_/_twist a few weeks back
when Hillman Library and six other
university locations introduced cop-
ying machines that require no spare
change, only a plastic Vend-a-Card.

After reoccuring breakdowns and V

other problems, the university
decided to purchase the new Xerox
system of copiers.‘ Ann Woods-
worth, associate provost and direc-
tor‘ of the university libraries, said

that several factors inﬂuenced the I

switch from the coin-operated pho-
tocopy machines to the Xerox Vend-
a-Card system. Until August, the
machines serviced by a centralized
company. There were recurrent

' complaints that the repairmen from

the company took too long to fix

them, Woodsworth said. There was
also the problem of obtaining
change.

A cost analysis led to a lease
agreement with Xerox. The library
is now leasing the new machines, so,
if they cannot be fixed by a library
repairman, Xerox will service them.

Another major issue is the price of
photocopying.

.“The cards offer competitive pri-
ces with what‘s down the street,”
said Woodsworth. “If the price of
the photocopying needs to be raised,
a coin-operated machine cannot
increase a price one-tenth of a cent.
The price would have to be increased
by five cents.”

The cost of the Vend-a—Card is an
initial 50 cents per card plus ﬁve
cents for every copy that you want to
purchase. It is estimated that the sys-
tem will pay for itself in three to five
years, according to Woodsworth.

Panthers’ Final Possession Cuts Off a

By MARK A. SINDLER‘

There was nothing pretty about it,
but Pitt quarterback John Congemi
got the job done. With 8:29 remain-
ing in the fourth quarter Saturday,
the Panthers leading Florida State
by one, Congemi took hold of a
comeback offense and smiled in the
face of a lazy clock.

The I9-play drive did not pad
Pitt’s 17-16 lead but thwarted any

FSU_ comeback hopes as the Panth- .

ers held on to hand the Seminoles
their third straight loss before 52,654
resurgent fans at Pitt Stadium.

“Just as long as we could control
the ball,” center Jim Sweeney said,
“and if we keep [FS U] off the field,
how can they score? This time it was
up to the offense to come back.”

True to the word, Pitt started
from its own 12 and slowly prodded
through the sponge of an FSU
defense that couldn’t soak up Joe
McCall short-yardage. plays. The
senior tailback picked up five first
downs on the series, including one
on an eight-yard screen.

Otherwise, McCall, out the last
three weeks with a pulled calf mus-
cle, -pulled‘ several off-tackle stunts
and right, stymieing the
Seminoles.

“On our last series, it was the
offensive line that played great,”
Congemi said, after Pitt wrapped a

tourniquet around a~two—game lois-I

ing streak and hiked its record to
3-2. 6 ’ F
Said Pitt head c_oach F oge Fazio,

"‘I guess when the line makes up its

mind, the backs canget-through the
holes.- And any time you get Chuckie
[Scales] one-on-one with anyone,
that puts a scare to a lot of people.”

The freshman tailback started his
first game on the collegiate gridiron,
taking many a punishing hit, finish-
ing the day with 35 yards on 13 car-

ries and hauling in the TD pass that ‘

put Pitt ahead to stay in the fourth
quarter.

Pitt’s final drive turned out to be
as important as that go-ahead score.

“The best defense in that case was
the offense,” said Pitt free safety
Tom Flynn.

Earlier in the game, though, an
offensive line that bulldozed FSU in

By LAURI KUBLI

Pitt volleyball coach Shelton Col-
lier refers to his team’s trip to
LaFayette, Ind. as the Rocky I expe-
rience. Although his team dropped
three matches and raised the once-
anemic loss column to five (against
19 wins), Collier maintains that the
three Top 10 teams to whom his
spikers lost would be hesitant to play
again. Like Apollo Creed, who
would not fight with the young
upstart again- V

In fact, the fourth-year coach con— _

cluded that, on the basis of his
team’s performance at the Purdue
Classic, his team will be ready to
meet these teams again — at the
NCAA Final Four.

“Ordinarily,” Collier explained,

l“l am guarded about evaluating the

capabilities of my team, but I am
now more confident than ever that
we are good enough to reach the
final four.”

The coach expanded that state-
ment: ‘‘I'm not saying qualifying for

the fourth quarter did not fit the part
— of any redeeming feature in the first.
» It looked like the Pitt ofthe past two
weeks. In the first quarter alone, the
refs saddled the Panthers with three
penalties for 35 yards —- all of which
likely led to the Seminoles’ rapid l3-
0 start from the gate.
The first score came when FSU
QB Kelly Lowery culminated a near-
five minute drive with a one-yard

. flip to tight end Tom Wheeler after_a

fake to fullback Cedric Jones.

Though not realizing it at the time,_

3:38 into the game, the Seminoles
missed a crucial score when place-

’ One may well ask how a team that
just lost three matches in one week-
end_ can discuss competing in the
Final Four in December. One. rea-
son -for Collier’s lofty confidence
level is thecaliber of the competi-
tion: Pitt lost to Kentucky (5),
=Nebraska ’ (6) and Purdue (7).
Another is_ the manner in which the
Lady Panthers lost — which was in
the true knock-down, drag-out
fashion of western-dominated
volleybragwl.

The Pitt spikers were impressive
in hitting 44 serving aces, the best at
the tournament.

“We established ourselves as one
o_f the best serving teams in the coun-
try,"’ Collier asserted. “All three of

' our opponents, who have played all
of the.Top' 10 teams in the country,
I said that we are the most intimidat-
ing team they have played all year.”

In their first match, friday at 9
p.m., the Lady Panthers locked
horns with the Purdue Boilermak-

kicker Philip Hal1’s PAT sailed we '

left. .
That did not seem to matter. On
its next series, FSU manipulated a
Pitt personal foul penalty (15 yards
from FSU’s 28), and Lowery this

time lofted a 16-yard lob to a fleet-

footed Weegie Thompson.

The flanker relied on his fingertips
as well as his 4.6 40-speed to barely
elude cornerback Troy Hill's tight
coverage a minute and a halfinto the
second quarter.

Perhaps it was a feat in itself that
the Pitt defense held the Seminoles
to 13 points in the first half, let alone
the entire game.

“At the half, we told our defense
that that TD was our fault,” Fazio
said. “Anytime you give them 15
yards, they have the momentum. We
said we gave them two TDs, so we
can still hold them.” «

Highly-touted Greg Allen pulled»

off two big l5-yard gains to post 43
yards by halftime and was comple-

mented by fullback Cedric Jones

and his 35 yards on eight carries.

Both of Allen’s infusions allotted
FSU key first downs in each of its
scoring drives.

Lowery, meanwhile, picked up
103 yards in passing on nine of 14
attempts.

Meantime, the Panthers rode an
offense with flat tires. After inflict-
ing two penalties on itself at the
game’s start, Pitt opted for a 38-yard
field goal that
shanked wide left.

Three more painful tries found the
Panthers relying on punts. The
Congemi-led brigade finally awoke
from its seemingly deep_slumber on
its fifth possession, the big play com-
ing after Congemi read a blitziand
hit ﬂanker Dwight Collins with a
27-yard passing strike.‘

After hitting McCall with two
straight completions and picking up
a three-yard scramble, Congemi
handed off to fullback Marc Bailey,

Crowd  Reaction
Spurs   P

By MARK A. SINDLER ’

There is no truth to the rumor
that the Pitt athletic department
brought in people from a West
Coast recording studio to tape a
full account of Saturday's clash
between Pitt and Florida State at
Pitt Stadium.

At least for rejuvenation pur-

poses, the thought may have
crossed the minds of a majority
of the Panthers who have lived
through two famished weeks of
no home crowd support.

No doubt the players knew
well in advance that their first
seven scheduled games would
find them at home only twice.
But no one imagined the brutal
“welcomes” they would receive
after that first home contest
against Temple.

After the week off, a Maryland
matchup beckoned. A sellout
crowd of 48,500 stuck some
amps into its throats and gave
Pitt the full treatment. Nothing,
though, absolutely nothing
could compare to an adventure

o

anthers

into the totally unknown at West
Virginia’s Mountaineer
last weekend.

Forget that the ushers had to
shoehorn more people into the
student section by 9 a.m. game-
day. Pitt quarterback John Con-
gemi, missing on several
audibles, found himself amidst a

raucous and literally ravenous

populace (64,076) that seemed to
lean more toward Roman gladia-
torial fights than Division I foot-
ball brawls.

Forget, too, that Pitt found
itself stuck with a 2-2 record,

after a ravishing start, because of '

a depletion of physical energy.

Plain and simple, road attend- J

ance slammed into Pitt more

forceful than a lineman into .

sleds.

So, with the crowd factor so A

affecting -them, the Panthers
more than welcomed a return to
the neighborly canyon called-Pitt
Stadium. They craved it- ‘

By MIKE SIBERINI

Bucknell scored three goals in the
span of 12 minutes early in the
second half to defeat the Pitt soccer
team 3-1 Saturday afternoon. The
loss was the fifth straight for the
Panthers, now 4-7 on the season.

In addition to losing the game,
Pitt also lost the services of junior
forward Sherland “Sparky” Lucke,
who suffered a broken leg seven
minutes into the contest. The injury

adds to the already sizeable list of ‘

wounded Panthers, which includes
defenders Uzumah Chibundu and
Jamie Katzin and midﬁelder Greg
Komoroski.

Pitt opened the scoring 33 min-
utes into the first half when fresh-
man Rich Burkholder volleyed a Vic
Hugo corner kick into the net.

The score remained l-0 until the
third minute of the second half when
Bucknell’s Bob Rhein scored his first
of two goals on the afternoon. Six
minutes later, Tom Karygiannis
scored the eventual game-winner,
making the score 2-1 at that time.
Rhein closed out the scoring in the
fifteenth minute.

Despite being outshot I8-8 in the
contest, Panther coach Leo Bemis
felt that the game was relatively
close. ‘

“They came out ﬁred up in the
second half, but the rest of the game
was pretty even, though they out-
shot us pretty good," he said. “We
could have had a couple more goals,
but we didn’t convert. We probably
would’ve made a different game of
it.” .

A pleasant surprise for Bemis was
the play of Hugo at wing back. Nor-
mally, the freshman plays midﬁeld,
but he was switched to fill a gap left
in the injury-riddled back line.

The result was a position which
was more attack-oriented. It was an
overlapping Hugo that applied the
initial pressure leading to the corner
kick that produced the Panthers’
only goal.

“That may strengthen our defense
as well as our transitions‘ from
defense to offense,” Bemis said of
the move. “Each game, I find a cou-
ple new players that make a good
contribution to the team.”

The Panthers enter the second
half of their season still in search of a
consistent scoring threat, which,
according to Bemis, will be a key to

the team’s success. Freshman Bob.

Howard is the team’s leading scorer
with four goals, all of them coming
in the last four games.

Bemis believes Howard is matur-
ing as a collegiate player, but he will
need thesupport from other young
players-to-offsetthe injury to Lucke.

Forcing FSU to punt once the
second half started, Pitt got started.
For good. At 10:32, Congemi hit
split end Bill Wallace for 22 yards
one play after the sophomore QB

I ran the keeper fourth-and-inches

from FSU’s 38.

On the next play, a.McIntyre_han-

doff at 10:27, though, linebacker
Ken Roe'plowe'd into Congemi’s
right side, decking him for the next
seve.ral plays..
, “The right side of my body was
open, and Roe was coming at full
tilt,” Congemi said. “When I sat
down, though, I was okay.”

While watching, sophomore
Chris Jelic stepped in, getting the
chance to have a Collins’ reception
nullified by a holding call and
sacked for six yards. -

Two plays later, Schubert made

good on a 40-yard field goal, the

score 13-10.

One series later,.Pitt pulled ahead
to stay. The seven-play, 3:07-
possession ended when Congemi

weaved a‘ 20-yard, short-side TD

pass to Scales on the first play of the
fourthjquarter. The freshman tail-
back lined up beside left tackle Bill
Fralic, ran an S-pattern and glided
past cornerback Eric Riley.

‘‘It was just a play we knew would
work,” Scales said, of the same for-.
mation that Pitt sent in during the
previous quarter’s last play.

~ Pitt had been practicing a similar
formation earlier in the week.

“We knew we were going to use
the play,” said Congemi, who passed
for 202 yards on 20 of 33 comple-
tions. “Thepattern let us read their
coverage while Bailey slanted in and
Scales went out.” ’

Both backs were part of a Pitt
backﬁeld that found itself, to a
degree, Saturday. Along with
McCall _and Mclntyre, the four
ground gainers churned out 176
yards overall while Fazio and offen-
sive coordinator Joe Moore effec-
tively used the revolving-door
method.

“That’s the type of offense we
have," Scales answered whenasked
whether he had any starting edge
over McCall based on his weekend
performance. _

“Between the two of us, there is
really no difference. [The coaches]
just let us do the job. No matter
who’s in there, we’ll be an entire
unit.”

For the first time in three weeks,

Pitt’s entire team banded together as-
, one and stood taut.

’ GRID BITS: McCall, who led all
backs with 96 yards on 18 handoffs,‘
was also near the top of Pitt’s receiv-
ing corps, grabbing eight passes for

Crowd Factor Multiplies IntoPitt Victory   

I

continued from page eleven

Tom Flynn said prior to the
Florida State contest. “It would
be nice to see the fans in our
corner from the first whistle to
the last gun against Florida

"State, which is known to have

some pretty radical fans."
Indications of similar insur-

gency appeared Saturday after

the second half began. Ten min-
utes into the quarter, FSU mov-
ing .left to right across the
newspaper page, Pitt defensive
end Bill Sapio seemingly forced a

‘fumble on Seminole QB Kelly

Lowrey after a seven-yard

. bootleg.

It need not matter who may
have recovered the ball, except
that FSU retained possession
since the officials called the play
dead, and cornerback Troy Hill
was “framed” on a holding call
resulting in 10 freebie yards for
the Seminoles.

“What Troy was‘ doing,”

. Flynn said, “was getting in front

of the receiver and holding him

' up. The guyzthought he threw the

ball [but] threw the flag.”
As if on cue, Hill started

' motioning as if in rain-dance for-

mation. With his arms upraised,

A the crowd offered its own rendi-
tion of boisterous hollering and
-booing, sending a few more

cracks through the stadium’s

structure.

“That really ﬁred the crowd
up," Flynn deadpanned. “That's
what we needed.”

No, that was ‘the correctly
prescribed medicine. Three plays
later, F SU’s line failed to pick up

a darting Al Wenglikowski

(rushend), who sacked Lowrey
for a four-yard loss and forced
FSU to punt for the fifth time.

For the remainder of the after-
noon, the noise from the crowd
of 52,654 never abated when the
Seminoles behind Lowrey took
to the field.

That took on added essence
when Pitt mounted its final stand
with eight and a half minutes to
play in the game. With every
handoff to tailback Joe McCall
or every Congemi rollout, the
fans, many of them still on their
feet, chewed into the Seminoles.

“It’s nice to be home,” Pitt
head coach Foge Fazio calmly
said after Congemi fell on the
ball and FSU fell on its face.

“Our team really stood tall
today. We’ve always been criti-
cized that our fans sit on their
hands. It shows why the players
play so doggone hard.”

Speaking on that behalf stands
no bigger or stronger an interior
lineman than tackle Bill Fralic.
Heexuded a deep sigh after the
one-point victory.

“It was a real sense of relief,”
Fralic said. “We stopped the ava-

lanche or the landslide or wha-
tever the hell 'you want to call it.”

The tumble to which Fralic is
referring is the two games prior
to Florida State. He had more
than his fill ofenemy crowds. So,
to relieve the pressure building
inside, he vented it during the
fourth quarter when he opened
holes for McCall that would
have easily accomodated a 747.’

“Those first two games we lost
by a total of nine points," Fralic
added. “We gave them away; we
could have won just as easily as
we lost." A

Accordingly, the team made
good on its intentions.

“We made a promise,” Flynn
said, “that everyone give 100 per-
cent. We played this one for
Pitt.” — A

Once the Seminoles quickly
established themselves on the
scoreboard, the Pitt defense
reverted to a better known tradi-
tion contrary to give-away play.

“We played from the bottom
of our hearts,” linebacker Troy
Benson said. “They scored two
early touchdowns. We just got
together and said we are not
going down.

“We~'knew we could shut them
down when everyone played with
their hearts.” -

‘‘It was an inspirational crowd
that really helped us, especially
our defense, which was shaky for

_ awhile,” Fazio said. “I would like
’ to thank the crowd; it’s really a

great, great feeling.
“No wonder our guys played
so darn hard.” . »

ers, who haven’t lost "on their own
court in over two years - a 23—match
winning streak. ’
“Literally, nobody in the nation
beats them at home,” Collier

‘- commented.

The Pitt players traded hard-
fought games with the Boilermak-
ers, 12-15 and 15-13, before being
knocked down in the third and criti-
cal game, 5-15. The Lady Panthers
jumped back in the game and hung
on for a 15-13 win in round four to
push the home team to a fifth and
deciding bout.

Purdue boiled Pitt in the fifth

‘ game for 12 points asrthe visitors

seemed to fall apart. Pitt pulled
together and fought to within three

_of the Boilermakers, 10-I3, before
. Purdue put its foot down to squash

the upstart Panthers 15-l0.
Despite the loss, Pitt had 20 ser-

, vice aces against the Boilermakers

— the most any team has ever scored
against Purdue. Freshman Kris
Wexell had seven of those, and jun-
ior setter Cathy Rupp aced six
serves. The match lasted a demand-
ing two hours and seven minutes.
“We will be ready to play them
again at the NCAAS,” said_ Collier..
On Saturday afternoon, Pitt met
Nebraska, and the Cornhuskers
were far afield of the Panthers, over-
powering Pitt in three games, ll-15,
9-15 and 11-15. '
According to Collier, “We play
extremely well against certain types
of teams. We had‘ trouble because
they play a style exactly like ours —
only they are, at this point, much
better at it.”
After the disappointing loss, Pitt’s

spikers got together and held a team ‘I

meeting, closed-door, without the
coach. Based on the results of the

next game, Collier thought, that .

meeting must have been valuable.
“We showed signs ofbrilliance in
dominating the fifth-ranked team in

the nation for parts of the game,”

Collier said of his team’s showing
against Kentucky. “We played one
of our best matches of the season.”
Paced by Ulana Kohutiak’s six aces,
Pitt grabbed round one from the

Lady Kats, 15-9. Kentucky beat

down the upstart Panthers, 5-15, but

Pitt overcame the top-ranked team _

in the crucial third game, 15-13.

Pitt fell hard in the final two
rounds, .6-15 and 4-15, but forcing
such a highly-ranked team to a fifth
game is a feat.

’ “In games “four and five, Kentucky V
proved why they are number five in I

the nation, but pushing them to five

games was a very big step for our A

young team,” Coach Collier said.

“Ulana Kohutiak had an out-
standing spiking match," Collier
continued. Kentucky’s All-America
and best_player led the tournament
with 17 spiking kills, and Ulana was
right behind with 16. We had 17 ser-
vice aces, and Kentucky had only
five,” Collier said.

“Ulana and Judy [Young] estab-
lished themselves as national caliber
spikers. A lot of our players saw that
they have the potential to be success-
ful at the Top 10 level,” Collier

maintained. “Carmen was impres-g ’

sive as she played like an expe-
rienced veteran in close matches.”

Collier maintains that the tourna-
ment should catapult his spikers into
the Top 20.

“We gained national respect,” he
asserted. “I feel we deserve Top 20
consideration because if we were
number 15, we would be expected to
lose closely to the fIfth-sixth- and
seventh-ranked teams, and we
pushed them to the limit.

Today, the team will" begin pre-
paring for the Final Four, according
to the coach.

“We will continue to develop our
serving and work extremely hard in.
the gym on the other aspects of our
game as well,” Collier said. “We
have a long way to go in our team
development, plus our setters were
just integrated back into the lineup. ”

z i ‘ ..The Pitt News, Monday, October 10, 1983

A ‘It just goes to show what the expe-

. rience of one can do for a group of
-others. Indeed, when’ we selected

ABC-TV’s college football analyst
and color man Beano Cook, did we
have any idea what kind of week The
Pitt News staff of college football
gurus for? '

. _ -Hark! No way.

‘Led by the Beano, the five of us
cooked up a conglomerate record of
54-21. Not bad after a week when
only one of us, “Guest Guru" Tom
McMillan, managed to peak the
double-digit mark for successful

_.picks. Yet despite all the banner glit-

ter of a successful weekend of college
football'prognostication, one ques-
tion remains in the mind.

 Gridiron Gurus

Why, oh why, did Pitt QB John
Congemi, with first-and-goal from
the three, decide to fall on the ball
and not go for some icing on the
cake? Had he opted for such an illus-
trious decision, all five of ’ us would

‘have been better off.

But, as we all know, whoTs to
argue over a win with coach Foge
Fazio? A win, damn it, is a win.
Every game, Fazio continues to
stress, is important.

As the saying goes, the Panthers
will take the win any way they can.

?\

 

But for the sake of the gurus as
well as our record, couldn’t Con-
gemi just consider jumping over the
goal line. See how easy the gurus
succumbed to the spoils of success?

Anyway, in addition to Beano’s
ll-4 mark, Charlie “The Cheese”
O'Hara and Mark A. Sindler , better

known as the “Grocery Bagger,"

came through with 11-4 records. ~

It might be said here, however,
that the Bagger will not be wearing
one on campus this week. So those
with binoculars would do better to
watch re-runs of Alabama wide
receiver Preston Gothard, with l0
seconds ‘remaining and the Tide

behind Penn State 34-28, catching a .

go-ahead TD.

As has already beenchronicled, a
referee with one ofthose white canes
ruled Gothard out of bounds, post!
poning the burial of Penn State.

Another guru, Scott “Scooter”
Dellett, came through the weekend
with a 10-5 record. Admirable, to
say the least. *

The one game that took us all for a
scoop turned out to be Nebraska at
Oklahoma State. As the 14-10 score
indicates, QB Turner Gill -and tail-
back ‘Mike Rozier must have been
out picking corn. ’

Give us a break. We all had the
Huskers by double digits.

Luckily, we didn’t double over in
laughter.

Leadership.

Some desk jobs are
more exciting than

As a Navy pilot
or ﬂight officer, your
desk can be a sophis-
I ticated combination
i of supersonic jet air-
craft and advanced electronic equipment.
But you can handle it. Because Navy
ﬂight training gives you the navigation,
aerodynamics and other technical
know-how you need.

In return, Navy aviation demands
something of you as an officer:

.....

Your path to leadership starts with
officer training that’s among the most
demanding in the military. It’s intensive
leadership and professional schooling
combined with rigorous Navy ﬂight
training. And it’s all geared to prepare
you and other college . I

This Desk Can Reach Mach 2.

     

Navy ﬂying.

The salary is exciting, too. Right
away, you’ll earnabout $18,300 a year.
That’s better than the average corpora-
tion will pay you just out of college.

And with regular Navy promotions and *
other pay increases, your annual

salary will soar to $31,100 after four
years. That’s on top of a full package

of benefits and privileges.

Before you settle down to an earth-
bound desk job, reach
