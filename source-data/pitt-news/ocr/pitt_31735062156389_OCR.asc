In a move unprecedented in re-
cent years, Interfraternijcy Coun-
cil Wednesday evening elected its
three top officers unanimously.

Elmer Shuster, pre-law student
and president of Sigma Chi fra-
ternity, copped the IF presidency
with nary a whisper of opposition.
Joe Trattner, Pi Lambda Phi, was
unopposed for the "vice-president’s
post, and Don Kettering, Delta
Sigma Phi, received unanimous ac-
clamation, for the secretary’s po-
sition. . -— ‘

opened for the offices of treasurer
and ﬁfth man did any debate.de-
velop.—_ Bill McKenna, Phi Gamma
Delta was ﬁnally elected treasurer
and .lVlel Forst, Sigma Alpha Mu,
got the fifth man’s job. -

Wednesday-’s harmony and good
will among the Greeks was a
marked contrast to the stormy and
bitter ﬁghts that have developed
at previous IF elections. V -
A ,Lu_d . Lippert, \outgoing_ prexy,
commented on the change of _atti-

Chest Auction Sale  

Helps Fund Raising’

By JIM DeWEESE

Going once! Going twice! Sold to the man with two
heads! ‘Room 132 C1 echoed to’ the chant of the auctioneer

high gear.

H’ Wednesday as the Pitt Chest fund-raising drive moved into

Tom Piemme and Lud Lippert held sway gas auctioneers

_ as Dean of Men T. W. Biddle and€

his “toss salad supreme” was.sold
to Mortar Board. Dean Biddle will
do his tossing at a dinner next
Thursday. 1 '

Services of Mr. R. A. Cunning-
ham and Mrs. Charles Elliot, both
of the dean of men’s oﬂice, went
to Sigma Alpha Epsilon Frater-
nity. It is rumored that the S.A.E.
lions need cleaning and painting.

Watch It Colonel!

_ A Cadet Colonel’s ROTC cap
went on sale and the bidding be-
came hot. Lt. Col. Ben F.’ Scott,
realizing that it was his cap, _al-
most decapitated Lud Lippert. Joe
Shuler got the cap and Lt. Col.
Scott got Joe.

Rattled by his brush with the
brass, Joe Shuler promptly began
bidding again and got himself a
feature story in the Pitt News.

Delta Zeta sorority won the bak-
ing services of Dean of Women
Helen P. Rush who pledged a cake
to the"fiighest bidder. Kappa Beta
Phi acquired the chaperone serv-
ices of Dr. John Ferguson. The
bidding on all services by faculty
members started at ﬁve dollars
and went up rapidly. 1

Means to the End

The auctioneers were not above
trickery to achieve their purpose.
A"raincoat only received bids of
one dollar so a scarf, several packs
of Chesterﬁelds, a chartruese ‘hat,
and an umbrella were added, in
turn, to go ﬁnally for $4.36.

Senior court members Isabel
Lubovsky and Adele Marraccini
have taken up their knitting
needles and will knit argyle sox
for Marshal Joe Hedges and Dan
Berger.

Notebooks, pencils, scarfs, top-
coats, hats and umbrellas all pass-
ed through the hands of the auc-
tioneers in record time as the Pitt
Chest was expanded by over $100.

'7‘ Artists Model Driftwood, Fruit,
Wine Bottles inPainting Studio

By NORM BURZYNSKI _ .

 Ingenuity is iwhat counts for a student at work in the

Fine Arts studio on the seventh floor. Occasionally an embryo.

artist will get an idea for a project from a tour of oneof the

are exhibits in the gallery, but mostly

In’ -the studio the students are'1>i—-— r
‘ .mostly on their own as what to do ‘

or make. Here is where theydon
the beret of artists and put to
practical application some of those
theories and ideas they have been
learning. ‘ P _ - _ ‘ '
 _ Art in Several Forms
'- Classes consist ‘of art work in
several forms. “Painting, design-
ing-, sculpturing, ceramics, silk
screeningf’, said Virgil Cantini,
well known enamellist and cer-
amist, “are some of the things
we’re doing now.”

The painters-are rather ingeni-

ous when it comes to selecting

_models, other than human. They
use empty wine bottles, drift- wood,

goranges, vases, dishes, and any-‘

thing else they can get their hands
on at the time. Some of the proj-
ects include fresco painting, which
 painting directly on wet plaster

walls. Most of the painters, along ‘

with students making mosaics,

-ceramic statues, and..metal animals '

plan to utilize their creations in
their homes.
A No Experience Needed"

‘To participate in the studio
classes making these creative ob-
jects, students don’t have to be ex-
perienced. Anyone interested, who
can hold a paint brush, a‘ pair ‘of
pliers,‘ or a glob of cement, may
take the studio courses. Of course
the history of art courses are ben-
eﬁcial for the potential artists and
should be tken if possible, although
they are not always necessary’ for
the studio work. . \ A

.,With such a combination of his-
tqry of art courses, the library, the
collections, the gallery exhibits,
and the studio work the ﬁne .arts
department is successful in pre-
senting the nature of art in a step
by step process. -In this manner
the department ﬁnally_achieves its
goal‘ of providing ' an essential
background for careers in archi-
tecture, teachings, and museum
work. ,

Emery Spills Dope
On Mound Stuff

By BORIS WEINSTEIN
Sports’ Editor

  

If anyone on the Pitt baseball team can relay the scoop

to awaiting bleacherites about Coach ‘Ralph Mitterling’s

pitching pupils, it’s the .catcher,—Milt Emery. --

The stocky East End catcher handled Pitt moundsmen

; throughout the 1952 season and knows their abilities and

shortcomings keenly. He supplies the dope on six pitchers

named by Mitterling as regular moundsmen this spring.

hose named are: Doc Shanafelt and Dick ‘Shannon, two
strong righthanders, who charged up the Panther staff last year.‘
Southpaw Ray Hollis, relief artist, and three newcomers, Gordy
Millegan, John Strahan, and Don Miller." _

From behind the plate, Emery throws some straight fast ones

‘concerning his hurlers. The "information, though, hits the target ﬂush

and gives an excellent rundown on Pitt’s mounders for the coming
season. —’ ‘ A  ' ‘
,“Those two guys—Shanafelt and Shannon—will be tough,” Emery
announced. "They moved up quick lastyear and by the end of the
‘season had the experience and poise needed. By college standards,
they’re tough.” Here’s what Milt says‘ about their assortments:

‘ Shanafeltegood stuff . . . has good ﬁnish on straight fast A

    

 

 

. owns. a “downer”l that breaks down and
. very easy to ‘handle.

ball with at “hop”. _ .
out . . . excellent change up delivery . .
Shannon-—good stuﬂ? 1. . . control steady .’ .  has live
‘ straight one . . conﬁdent . . overhand pitcher that comes
in feeling “soft’.’. . experience helps make’ him in clutch.
Emery continued with his pitching report by‘ sizing up, the
otherveteran pitcher-—-__Hollis. “He had a ‘great fast one “before he

‘ injured ‘ his back two years . ago. Since then _ he has ‘V changed his

style."But1-'I’ll tell you, the important thing out there ‘is guts,
poise, moxey, and the feeling that the guy up at the plate is nothing.’4’
Hollis-V-only southpaw on regular staff ' .' . . “junk” pitcher
. . .. slow hook, drop, and slider . . pitches» mostly in tight
*relief spots .' . easy ‘to handle . . smart with “cute” stuﬁ.
Now we come to the three boys who Mitterling must use to
backup his -“big three.”' “I haven’t worked. with them too long
this winter, but if they catch the spirit that is present around here,”
Emery reasoned, “they can’t miss.?’
, _Millegan—-curve ball .' fast ball
promise but it’s up to him . . good control.
Strahan—fa.ir fast pitch . . needs work to develop ﬁnish ,

FRANKE .

, Five members of Rex» Peery’s crack wrestling team will
get a chance to add more lustre to an already sparkling
season when they represent Pitt at the annual NCAA mat
tourney at State College next Friday and -Saturday.

Hugh Peery, Joe Solomon,
have been selected by Peery,,

and E1dred‘Kraemer already
with the remaining two jobs

hinging on the outcome of two elimination tryouts today.

The tryouts’ will‘ pit George‘

Matthews against Bill Kozy for the
137-pound nod and Chuck Uram

against Bob Cook in the 147-
pound class. If Uram fails, how-

ever, to trim down to this‘ class, 

he will have to battle for Solo-
mon’s 157-pound berth.

Peery - Defends Crown

Peery, Solomon, and Uram com-
peted in last year’s NCAA scram-
ble at Fort Collins, ,Colo., where
Peery easily nailed down the 115-
.pound championship. The latter
two were eliminated in quarter-
ﬁnal matches. ‘ \

Kraemer, Pitt’s iron man, ‘vill

be taking a fling at the heavy-
weight crown. An injured rib will
keep, ~ Harold Hunter, -another
heavy, from competing in the 191-
pound class. ‘
' All of the mentioned grapplers
pitched in with points to spare last
week in Cleveland to walk oif with
the 4-I championship, the, ﬁrst
Wrestling title in Pitt history.

Managers of the three remain-
ing contenders for the Intramural
championships will meet with IM
Director Leo Bemis this afternoon
at the Field House to determine
which team will "draw a bye in the
forthcoming ﬁnals of the. playoffs:
‘ _ Competing in the upcoming con-‘
tests, which will be played on the
“Field House.’ ﬂoor Monday and
Wednesday at 4:30 p.m., are the
Frosh Gridders, Varsity Hall, and
the IF championships. The. Wed-
nesday battle will be for the IM
title. ‘ '‘

Showing a 12-1 record, the Hall-
men smashed the Industrial_ En-
gineers hopes to retain its 1952'
crown in gaining a top berth, for
the playoffs. The Gridders got by
the-Pharmacy Mixers in its drive
to the top and the IF champs,
crowned last .. night, are pointing‘
for an All-Campus sweep.
