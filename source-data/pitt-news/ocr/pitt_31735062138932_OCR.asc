Program Causes the
Trouble . '

 

Owing to the unavoidable cancellation
of the concert December 24, at Warren,
Ohio, the fourth concert night of the
proposed concert tour of the Combined
Musical Clubs of the University of
Pittsburgh, and the inability of Man-
ager Don Hise to secure another town
for' Xmas Eve, the greater part of the
tour planned for the holidays has been
necessarily cancelled. The impractica-
bility of a trip with an open date is
easily seen, and it was deemed best to
call the latter part of the trip off. .

However, there will be considerable
glory, for those members of the clubs
who have been picked for the tou_r. in
the fact that two of the concerts. have
not been cancelled. Those two are Fri-
day and Saturday, December 20th and
21st. On Fridav evenina nf +his week
the clubs will stage their concert pro-

Auditorium; under the auspices of the
Glee Club of that school. Saturday
evening a similar program will be given
in Sharon, Pa., in the F. H. Buhl Club.

Reports from both cities indicate that
large crowds will turn out to the con-
certs, since the advance sale of tickets
has been favorable. Many of the Pitt
students,- who are residents of these two

Aciiou on -HONOR PLAN
cons UP NEXT mom

No further action has been taken by

the Board of Control in the matter of
the proposed honor system for. the Uni-
versity. A member of that body gave
out the following statement: ‘
' “Nothing has been done in regard to
this matter for the last few days, and
on account ‘of the examinations coming
at this time there will be nothing done
until after the ﬁrst of\the year. When
the University opens in January we ex-
pect to take the matter up with the
Faculty. We also expect toghawe the
sentiment of the students expressed on
the proposition at that time. During
the. vacation perioda careful study of
the systems that are in use in the vari-
ous colleges of the country will be made
in order that the best system possible
may be had for the University.”

As far as can be learned the Faculty
and the students are divided on the
matter,‘ of the adyisibility of installing
the honor system at the present time.
All, agree, however, that if the system
is put in, it must be a complete system
and no half-way plan will be considered.
What the ultimate result ofithe propo-
sition that has been brought ‘forward by
the Board of Control will beiremains to
be seen next month. ‘

games won was not very high.

next season. Mr. Davis claims that
the schedule that is being arranged for

DR. CRAFER GIVES HIS
VIEWS ON SOCIETY
_ “CAT” PARTIES

Engagement parties for pet cats and _

other extremes to which the ultra-rich
go in. order to display their. wealth, are
unpardonable crimes, according to Dr.

T. B. Crater, instructor in sociology at p "
the University. Dr. Crafer claims that ‘

such things as these are {the things that
stir- up the anger Of
the rich. He claims that it is the spend—_
ing of vast sums of money in an.en-

deavor to spring some unique fad that A

is hard to countenancein the face of
so much poverty; ' A
A few days ago the dailypapers had‘
an account of an engagement party for
pet cats that was given by ‘a leading
society woman Of" the East, and the
matter was called- to the attention of
Dr. Crater ‘by a -man in one of his
classes. In commenting On‘ the «affair,»

- 1 .

Dr. Crafer said in part: ‘

.

“It is just such an exhibition as that i '

which makes for strife‘ and .envy be-

tween the poor classes and the rich.. ..

That any human being should go to

such an extreme in the effort to display "
incomprehensible. '

wealth
Never

is‘ almost ,

in the days just before. the

French Revolution was there anything ~ 

attempted by the rich ...tO show their

"wealth that equals the things that are

done at the present time.

A “Consider what the money that was’ _
‘spent on that party would have done - --

for the good. of humanity if it had been

‘placed in the proper channel. The Cats g
were imported at a fabulous price——sev-_ ‘

eral thousand dollars for each one——th_e
party Cost many thousands more. ‘This

' ‘ money would have clothed and educated -

at least a dozen persons that can
scarcely exist under their present con-
dition. Is it not a crimewhen there
are so many in need_tO spend a fortune
for a party for a couple _O_f'cats?

“I think that there should be some
way’ for society at large to stop such

«outrageous exhibitions as are goingon

in‘differer'i't parts of this country at the
present time.” - v

1 ,-things that come with Christmas that it
is hard -to say: that any oneis above all

I
_~After a restof two weeks the'stu-
dents of the University ought to ‘come
back to their _various depar.trrients~ready
to make the work of the winter term
the best of the school year, The win-
ter term is the term thatthe instructors
put on all the heavy work that. is pos-

_ sible, for the reason that there are less
8 things to take the attention of the. stu-
’ dents during that period than ‘any other.

past, s_o there is more time for real‘

work. »

. To one and all The Pitt Weekly
wishes AMERRY CHRISTMAS AND
A HAPPY NEW YEAR, and that we
may all gather again at the close of the
vacation period ready for earnest work.

CHANCE FOR A HOCKEY TEAM

Weekly to have the stadium flooded and
used for a skating rink during the win-
ter imonths_is successful, there is every
reason to believe that Pitt will be rep-

teams in the college world. There is
a great amount of good hockey mate-
rial in the University and all'that is
;needed to bring out-this talent. is a place
to skate. * Since the Duquesne Gardens
closed several years ago there has been
no place that was available for hockey
aspirants. in the University- within a

, reasonable distance of the campus.*- But

if the plan to have,the stadium ﬂooded

outdoor rinks in the city within reach
of every student of the'University.

student that does not play. the ice game,
but loves to skate for exercise, is very
great, and every personconnected with
the University would receive a beneﬁt
from the proposed rink.

THE HONOR sYsTEM

There is an effort being made at the
present time to have the honor system
in regard to examination established at
Pitt. The matter has been taken up
by the Board of Control and has been
acted favorably‘ upon by that body, and
will be taken up with the Faculty of

‘the University at an early date. There

are many things that are commendable
in’ the honor system, and there “are a
few things ‘that are not so commend-
able. There are many places where the
system has worked very well and there
are «places where the system has been
a miserable failure. i ,
It would be well for those that are
working out the plan for the proposed
honor system at the University ‘to look
into all the good and the bad points (if

‘ the system before taking serious action

in the matter. It would be well to
study the system at the ‘places."that it
has worked well and at» the colleges
where it has failed, and try to find the
reason for failure, in order that _the
code that is prepared for Pitt will have
all the weak pointsleliminated. .
The honor system is a great thing
when it works-—-but far worse than no
system at all when ‘it fails. ‘ V

PITT MAY HAVE _.
' SKATING RINK

r

s

Plans are. being considered,.for tl1e
ﬂooding of Trees’ Stadium, in order
that the students of,the‘U'niversity can
have a place to skate during the winter‘
months. The matter has been taken up
with the faculty by The Pitt Weekly
and a report will be made ‘the first of
the year as to the feasibility of‘- making
a skating rink out of the stadium.

Chancellor McCormick says that the
rink would be a great thing for the stu-
dents, and that ifit is possible for the
athletic ﬁeld to be converted into‘a rink
it willibe done without doubt. How-
ever. this is a matter for those in charge
of that department of the University
activities to look after.

Director_of Athletics Miller is very
enthusiastic of the proposition. He said
that if the plan was capable of being

< carried out that it would mean that the

University would be represented .by one
of the best hockey teams in the State.
Mr, Miller feels sure that there is a
great amount of good hockey material

. in the University and that Pitt could

have a good team, if there was only
someplace han.dy where the mencould
practice.

Mr. Miller hinted further that if it
was found that the stadium could not
be used for the purpose of a rink, that
efforts would be made to ﬁnd some
other place where a rink could be made
for the use of the students. it

By the time_that the Christmas recess
is over, the students will know whether
they are to have a rink. .

It has been estimated by the mem-
bers of the Owl Board that the cost
of producing the Owl this year will
be about $1,800, and it was further
estimated that if allthe Juniors in
all the schools of the University
would agree .to pay $5.50,» this amount,

together with the ads that could be.

procured, would just about‘ cover the

cost of production. _
A motion was made and passed to

have the Owl Board call such meet-

ings as they deemed needful to in-

form the Junior class ot their plans
to publish and ﬁnance the Owl. T
‘It was decided to have the chair-
man of the Advisory Board on Stu-
dent Activities meet with the Deans
of the various schools, in order to
present the problem of Owl Board
to them and to secure the co-opera-
tion in placing the Owl on a high
plane.
' It was suggested that the repre-
sentatives of the various student ac.-
tivities be served notice‘. to be present
at the January meeting of the Advis-

ing question.

STUDENTS ARE JWORKING

. Over 100 men have been given po:
sitions during the Christmas’ season
by the Student Emplovment bureau
of the University. The men are
working in all lines of trade.

Many men made arrangements, With
the deans of the various schools to
take their exams early or to take
them in January, in order to be able
to work’ before Christmas.

Karl E. Davis is secretary of the
bureau and found places for all the
‘men that are working. The bureau
is a little over a year old.

 

During the fall of 1912, ten men were
killed as a result of playing football, but

not one of thesewas a college man.

Columbia expects to have a total regis-

“Bill” Leahy, who has played a star.

his nose, received in the Navy game. ‘

In the early part, of the contest, he
received a Hard bump on the nose but
paid no attention to it. He did not lay
off from practice a single day and played
four games following the‘injury with-
out even reporting to Team Physician.

Leahy has foungl difficulty in breath-

operation was successful and “Bill” is

SPORTING EDITOR

«KNOWS LITTLE HISTORY"

That the Sporting Editor should study

is the opinion of many. In the last

coming Pitt—Penn contest would be the
first one played between the two Insti-
tutions. Ilge‘ was wrong. , I

HAURSTI TALKS ON
* IMPORTANT QUESTION_

.Thatiever_v student that sells his stu-
dent book to some one that he is not
sure will sing and yell and root for
Pitt just as much as the student would
himself is doing a great amount of harm
to the University, is the opinion of
Laurence BL Hurst, former'Graduate
‘Manager of Ahletics.

“I tried during the entire’ time I was
in office,” said Mr. Hurst, “to put the
fellows on their honor about the matter
of athletic books, but I have found that
there are many who have taken’ advan-
tage of the book system. That is why
there were so many in thecheering
stands when every man ought. to have
been on the ﬁeld helping make” the pa-
‘rades a success.” ‘ - . .

“I think that the boys do. not realize
the good they are getting from the
books. [When I went to the University
we had to pay’ so much for the support
of the athletics of the University and
then had to pay the regular price_ of
admission to get into the games. And
they were not the kind ofgames that
are given the students now.”

If the fellows do not use a little more
discretion in .the matter of the books,
the time will soon come when every
man will have-to have a picture of him-
self in the front of his athletic book.
That would be the only way that the
people at the gate would be able to tell
whether the right party had the book
or not. I hope this will not have. to
be done,1’ —

The P. A. ,A. Clubhouse will -be the
scene of a lively fencing bout 'next Fri-
day and Saturday evenings, and Pitts-
burgh will see the ﬁrst big fencing at-
traction of her history. To Prof. G. W.
Postgate goes most of the praise’ for

ceasingly for several years in this city
to establish fencing and -renew the once
popular sport. He started his work as
instructor of the-P. A. A. team and _last
winter was elected to coach the Pitt
fencing team. O ‘ I

The Gold and Blue team was selected
from some twenty candidates by a Round
Robin tournament; in which every fencer
met ‘all, other aspirants and the ofOl1I'
having the best ‘averages were chosen
for the team. Gray, Bernard; -Roney
and Pratt defeated their opponents, and
all excepting the‘la_tteir, who is a sub-
stitute, will representthe Gold and Blue.

P. A. A. will have Holroyd, Haines
and Brown on the mat for them and
the German Club will be repr‘esen_ted~by
Meriai), Stephanus and Bernard. The
latter is afather of the Pitt fencer-and
these two should furnish. an- exciting
contest when they cross foils. Cornell
has -not sent in entries as- yet, but it is
understood that they will have a strong
team. A

The winner will be chosenin a Rsaigd
Robin tournament of 54 Bouts. on Fri
day evening 39 of these will be held
andtthe following evening the rema"-
ing 15 will be held. Those holding
Student Books will be admitted Friday
evening, but the Association has not as
yet -decided to admit the Pitt men on
Saturday night. An informal dance

day night.

Prof. Postgate believes the Pitt team
has a fair chance of winning, but makes
no boasts, as his pupils will fence some
of the best men in the country.

THE ‘PITT WEEKLY

 

_ FRESH AND‘ SOAPHS

IN LIVELY TUSWSLE

 

. , ‘
State Hall was the scene of a lively T

tilt —between Freshmenband Sophomores
on Monday afternr;on._ For a’ few min-
utes there was a real war going on. But
after a few minutes the conflict came to
an end, for the Freshies pushed the
small crowd of Sophs aside and marched
down the front steps to the street——and
that was all that caused the trouble in
the first place. .

At a meeting of the First Year Men,
held ‘on the second ﬂoorof the building.
it was decided that the old—time custom
that the Fresh must ‘make their exit

via of the basement should be broken. ‘

So down the stairs to the first ﬂoor
came all the Fresh, and made a break
for the door. At diis juncture the Sophs
tried to interfere———and the ﬁght was on.
While it lasted- it was one of the ﬁerc-
est ﬁghts that has ever been pulled off
at Pitt. But the Sophs were outnum-
bered and soon were pushed to one side

V while the Fresh marched down _to the

street. M

The Sophs swear vengeance on the
nervy Fresh, and it is likely that before
long the feud between the two classes

..

nent fund to be known as the Life

vested by the Treasurer as directed by
the entire "Executive Committee of the
Alumni Council, said committee to con-
sist of the Ofiicers of the Council and
the Chairman of each regular committee.

(3 ‘That by action of a majority of
mem rs present at any regular or
special meeting of the Alumni Council,
the interest of said fund may, if neces-
sary, be transferred to the maintenance
account of the General Alumni Associa-
tion. i

(4) That the fund proper shall at
no time be appropriated for any special
purpose except by the consent of all
living life members, and that any part
of the fund accruing throifgh demise of
life members may revert to the mainte-
nance fund of the General Alumni As-
sociation with the consent of three
