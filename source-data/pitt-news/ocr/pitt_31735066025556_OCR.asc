from AIDS but who are still living
with the disease.

The panel read, “For those
who have fallen from the tree of
life and for those who are still
holding on.”

Richard K. Smith is one who is
still holding on. He was diag-
nosed as HIV positive in 1985
and has had “bunches” of friends

affectionately to those who have

Mary Hughes handed a tissue
to a young man who was unable
to hold back his tears as he stood
over a quilt panel made for a
friend who had died of AIDS.

Three years ago, Hughes
would have needed that tissue.

When the quilt was last dis-
played in Washington, D.C.,
Hughes did not come to see it
because she had very recently
lost a friend to AIDS.

The bisexual movement is
gaining strength in the United

. States, said Loraine Hutchins, a

national bisexual activist.

“One of the most exciting
things happening to me is to see
gay student groups leading the

way by including bisexuals, not
only in the titles of the groups
but also in your programming
and your leadership,” Hutchins
said. I

“V(7hen I was in college, there
was no lesbian, gay or bisexual
movement,” she said. “When I

AIDS that “by hiding in your room and waiting
to die  don’t know the support you are miss-
ing.”

His words turned cold when the subject
changed to President Bush. “Ignorance is no
excuse, [Bush] knows what he is doing.”

Panels were made from a wide variety of peo-
ple all sharing a common thread — each panel-
maker lost someone close to AIDS.

Alan Mickel from Lexington, Ky. made his
wife a panel from the cloth of two of her
favorite dresses. His wife contracted AIDS from
a blood transfusion when she was 67 years old.

Lisa Bernard from Maryland made a panel for
her father with the help of her fathers life—long
partner Jerry Vroomau. ‘

Richard Scalessa made a quilt for his lover,
Jon Edwin Irwin, who died last summer.
Scalessa included in the panel a piece of needle-
point that Jon had been working on when he
died. Scalessa added to the panel a needle with
a piece of yarn needed to ﬁnish the work.

As of October 1992, nearly three million peo-
ple have visited the quilt, which stretches for 12-
and—a-half football ﬁelds.

Names on the quilt range from celebrities to
babies —— from performer Liberace to 3-year-old
Joshua Copeland.

When the quilt was first displayed on Oct. 11,
1987 in D.C., it was made up of only 2,000 pan-
els, and last Saturday, from 9 a.m. to noon,
almost 2,000 panels were handed in at a tent on

P the lawn.

“We have broken some

“One house had 800 women
on one list, and another house
had 1,800 people invited. If
we’re going to report that

we have to do these things.”

IFC also discussed the sus-
pension of several fraternities
from intramural activities for
failure to pay dues. The hous-
es forfeit all games until their
dues are paid — a punishment
that the IFC does not enjoy
enforcing.

Discovering America
0 Five hundred years after Columbus “discovered”
America, at least for western civilization, the
debate on the famous explorer’s legacy -for the
country has reached a peak.

The image _taught in the past — Columbus dis-
covered America, wanted to prove the world was
round and treated the native people benevolently
—— has been destroyed. That image has been
replaced by the truth that Columbus did not “dis—
cover” America, he just discovered it for western
civilization. Generally speaking, people of
Columbus’ time realized that the world was
round, and that he treated the natives he met ter-

- ribly and for his own personal advantage.

But the impact that Columbus had on the world,

especially on the United States, was tremendous.

Trying to paint Columbus as an evilrepresentative
of an evil western civilization or an angelic
explorer is too one-dimensional. He was an ambi-
tious, profit-oriented adventurer. He was a small
piece of the giant takeover of the American conti-
nent and the beginning of a noticeably spotted

- ,' history.

Today, people will get the day off for the .cele-
bration of his voyage. But, when one looks at the
impact of the voyage it is hard to be sure that a
celebration is the most appropriate response to
this anniversary. '

Accusing Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton
of all but being a Communist, Congressman
Robert Dornan from California gave an
impassioned speech questioning Clinton’s
patriotism and reasons for visiting the
Soviet Union in 1969.- Specifically, Dornan
wanted to know whether or not Clinton had
dealings with the KGB during his visit to
Moscow-. ’ — ~ ‘-

It is important to note however, that as is‘
evidencediby an empty congressional floor, very
few of Dornan’s colleagues ‘gave any weight

‘l to his speech. Oddly enough, the only person

who seemed to give these accusations any

0' validity was President Bush, who on “Larry King

Live” stressed the importance of Dornan’s criti-

" cisms.

Now picture this: Arkansas Governor Bill
Clinton standing on a podium, a Soviet Flag in
one hand and reading from Karl Marx’s
Communist Manifesto. Let’s be real. Clinton is no
communist. The only one with an identity crisis
here is Bush. At least the first time Bush identi-
fied with an historical figure, it was somebody to
be proud of — Harry Truman. Now it seems as if

, Bush has to resort to the scare tactics that can

only be associated with names like J. ‘Edgar
Hoover and Joseph McCarthy.

-Not a vote for Clinton, but against Bush

This year’s presidential elec-
tion will come down to the
economy. Family values, abor-
tion, the draft and Iran—Contra

- are mere wedge issues to a.

large portion of the population
— a ball of string for the play-
ful media. '

Bush was riding a 90—percent
approval rating after Iraq. The
economy played a-large hand
in transforming l1irr'11;into an
underdog. Carter lost the elec-
tion of 1980 not only through
his bumbling foreign affairs
policy but also because of the
dismal shape of our economy.

A‘ recession undermines the
mood of the country. Even if
the recession hasn’t hit home,
the tone of the papers and the
inferences of the media create
an untrusting and fearful atti-
tude. The layoffs occurred
therelyesterday, why not here
today? ‘

Families cut costs through
bargain shopping and delaying
the purchase of the big—ticket
items. Businesses tighten their
belts worried that tomorrow
will not get any better and may
even get worse. Consequently,
families and individuals align
.themselves with businesses and
reduce purchases. The old
adage applies: it is better to be
safe than sorry.

This, in turn, reduces con-
sumer demand, which directly
and immediately affects supply.
Less demand means less work.
If the demand for goods con-
tinues to decline, businesses
will eventually lay off workers.
As‘ soon as layoffs and pes-
simistic economic indicators
occur frequently enough to
warrant attention by the media,
the fear spreads. Will it be my
business to go bankrupt next?
Will my company lay me off
next? _ .

For one half of George
Bush’s term, towns have seen
factories close, neighbors out
of work and children struggling
to use their skills. This is what
affects voters. This is why it is

not Bill Clinton beating Bush,
but the economy.

The economy has sunk into a
third clip. The only event that
inﬂates economies is consumer
confidence. As soon as opti-
mism returns, purchases

‘increase. For all the rhetoric,

the economy has demonstrated
that the country is faced with

I “ Chuck  
Petersheim

severe times. Everyone is aware
of it, and it only makes matters

’worse to have our president

deny the obvious. A restructur-
ing of family priorities and
business strategy is occurring
and President Bush seems
unwilling to face a changing
tomorrow.

Jobless’ rates are up, profits
down. Westinghouse, along
with other large companies,
has been slashing its payroll.
IBM is forcing 40,000 people to
retire. The national debt hangs
over us — someone will have
to pay it back. The dollar has
hit an historic low; health care
is dragging both business and
individuals to their knees; inter-
est rates have been lowered so
frequently that the once-sacred
move has turned into a curious
sideshow; cities are in dire
need, asking for a jolt the fed-
eral government cannot supply;
and George Bush has refused
to step into the ordinary n1an’s
shoes.

While Bush may doubt the
seriousness of the hard times,
Americans do not. The country
knows, and while most of us
have not been on the streets
protesting, a feeling exists that
the president was wrong on
this one. Party affiliation aside,
a recession can be felt.

Bush was attempting to wait
out the storm. Recessions are
quick and necessary — a built-
in part of a ‘free market.
Expansion and austerity. He

figured he had two years until
election and the economy
would recover. .

It has not recovered, so Bush
sits in a precarious position. He
gambled that time would be
enough to remedy the ills —

, he lost. Against the expert

opinions, the economy has
stubbornly resisted the inade-
quate stimuli.

-_ Candidates win because peo-
ple are satisfied. The majority

of Americans do not involve ' ‘

themselves politically; they are
concerned about their own
lives. A robust optimistic life

will ensure an incumbent’s '

return. People don’t like
change. Stability in each indi-
vidual family wins elections.
We have been pushed into a
corner.
watched as things grew worse

instead of better, backed into a a

corner where the only chance
of victory lay in aggressive

action. We were willing to I

believe the president -— not
anymore. The status quo has
not been what we had hoped.
When your livelihood is threat-
ened and your elected leader
fails to ‘provide a safety net, it
is certain the call for change
will surface and gain momen-
tum. That momentum will not
be leading in any specific
direction except away from
President George Bush.

It is not a joke. People in this
country are suffering. Week by
week some historic record for
dismal economic performance
falls. We need leadership, not
procrastination. We need ideas,
not politics. We need a presi-
dent who can work with the
partisan Congress. We need
action in every segment of soci-
ety, and George Bush has
refused to act. Stubbornness
and archaic policies will not
work. We need change, we
need understanding, we need
attention — desperately. I don’t
know if Bill Clinton is the man,
but President Bush most cer-
tainly is not.

  SHAM-ROCKED

Notre Dame pounds Panthersfor 521 yards in 52-241ro

By Ryan Buncher

Sports Editor

Pitt football fans greeted
Notre Dame head coach Lou
Holtz with a sign reminding
him of his team’s 33-16 loss to
Stanford.

Holtz seemed amused by the
sign after the game. He said
that he wanted his team to see
it.

It is easy to laugh after your
team runs through, passes over
and beats up an opponent for
521 yards of total offense as the
Fighting Irish did to the
Panthers in a 52-21 pounding
Saturday night.

Laughter was far from Holtz’s
mind early on though, as Pitt
was able to move the ball well
on the questionable Notre
Dame defense.

“It really scared me when
they came out early and. were
able to run the football,” Holtz
said. “lA1ex] Van Pelt is an
awful good quarterback. We
just felt that-we could not allow
them to run.” V

Tim Colicchio started Pitt’s

second possession of the game

by ripping off a‘19-yard run.

. After a._ho1d.ing_C.a11 on Notre

Dame kept the drive alive, the
Panthers moved methodically
down the field.

On a Panther third-and-goal
at the three, .Notre Dame’s‘
Bobby Taylor broke up a Van
Pelt pass-‘intended for Chad
Askew, forcing Pitt to settle for
a 20-yard Sean Conleyijfield
goal. ’

The drive was costly, as
Colicchio suffered a hip pointer
which limited him the -rest‘ of
the night. The backfield depth
that Pitt "head coach Paul

Hackett had
stressed was gone.

Jermaine Williams was
already scratched from the line-
up, and Curtis Martin was, in
Hackett’s words, “a shadow of
himself.”

Notre Dame answered by
taking advantage of Pitt’s bad
tackling. Mike Miller and Lake
Dawson both broke tackles
after short receptions for big
gains, Miller for 18 yards and
Dawson for 37. Jerome Bettis
finished off the drive with an 8-
yard scoring run to the left
side.

Pitt had another long drive,
again aided by la Fighting Irish
penalty. Van Pelt threw incom-

continually

plete on third—and—19 at the 4,

Panther 11, but Notre Dame
was called for being offside.
On, thenext play, Van Pelt
found Jells for a 29-yard catch
with a personal foul tacked on
the end. Conley capped the
drive with a career-high 48-
yard field goal to make the
score 7-6.

Bettis got the Irish offense
rolling in the second quarter
with a 29-yard run. A personal
foul call on the play put Notre
Dame ,.O1.'1..the.Pitt g7.

The Panthers nearly had the
Irish stopped with a third and

15 at the 52. Mirer was able to .'

scramble away from the rush
and ﬁnd Dawson for a 14-yard

gain. Mirer took a keeper

around the right end for six
yards to convert the fourth
down play. Two plays later he
found tight end Oscar McBride
in the left corner of the end
zone for a 14-6 Irish lead.
“Tonight, a couple times we
had a better pass rush than we

./We7’l’S Crosscoiintiy wins city title J

By Jason Feuchtwanger
For’ the Pitt News

The Pitt cross country team ran
right by Duquesne at the City
Championships in what Panther
coach Jim Lear called an upset.
“They beat us at Slippery Rock
a couple of weeks ago. To come
back with this win is important
because we compete with them
for recruiting in Western
Pennsylvania,” Lear said.
' Duquesne made it a close race
by placing three runners in the
' top seven.‘ Pitt pulled out the vic-
tory by a margin of six points, 34
to Duquesne’s 28.‘ Carnegie
Mellon finished third and Robert
Morris finished fourth. ‘
, Pitt’s Carmela Mariani, an All-
American at 10,000 meters, won
the meet with a time of 18:37.

There was, however, a contro-
versy with Mariani’s win. Mariani

-might have turned before the last

' cone heading for the finish.

Lear said that it would not
have determined the outcome of
the race.

“She didn’t do it to gain an
advantage. She clearly had the
girl, [from Duquesne] beat,” Lear
said. - ,

Lear said he was happy with
Mariani’s win but added that she
hasto improve in two weeks to
compete with the top runners at
the Big East Championships.
Mariani did manage to shave over
a minute off her time from the
meet at Slippery Rock.

Pitt’s top five runners were
bunched pretty tightly. Melanie
Tshman was third with a time of
19:19, a
Judey Tracey was fifth with a
time of 19:58 and Tonia Molloy
washeighth with a time of 20:05.
Rounding out Pitt’s top five was
Natasha Van Reil with a time of
20?41. ‘ 

Staff Writer

Senior Waddle Freeman and sopho-
more Frank Nesko finished seconds
apart to lead the Pitt men’s cross
country team to victory in Friday’s
cross country City Championships.

The Panther runners overcame
Carnegie Mellon, Duquesne and
Robert Morris for their second con-
secutive city -championship. -

Free1nan’s win marked the second
time in the past two weeks that he
led all Pitt runners, having finished
first for Pitt and 19th overall at the
Notre Dame Invitational.

“I feel that we ran real pretty well
as a team, we came a long way in
practice this past week,” Freeman
said. “I consider Frank and I the
same caliber runners and had a
strong feeling during the last part of
the race that Frank and I were going
to finish one and two, and that’s
what mattered. I wasn’t worried
about who would finish first. He
showed a lot of heart by recovering-

Unknown to spectators and coach-
es at the finish line, Nesko had fallen

during the race but managed to make

up lost ground quickly.
“I was pleased by Frank’s recovery
from the fall and the strong time he

still ran,” distance coach Jim Lear

said. “Waddie Freeman did a ‘great
job also. They both ran real well,
very controlled, disciplined races. I
wasn’t concerned with who finished
first because we are trying to put up
good numbers as a team.”

Finishing in third place for Pitt and
fourth place overall was junior Mike
Lynn. First-year student Matt
Clarkson and junior Brian
McCollough rounded out Pitt’s top
five, ~

Even though the competition at this
meet was not as strong as what Pitt
usuallyfaces, Lear said that there
were still many reasons to be encour-
aged by Pitt’s performance. Two first-
year runners, Clarkson and Dennis

~ Kuntz, ran very good races and are

THE PI'IT NEWS, Monday, October 12, 1992

Durante leads Buffalo in surprise of Pitt soccer team 1-0

By Bennett Zamoff
For the Pitt News

University of Buffalo forward
Mike Durante scored on a
breakaway in the second half
yesterday to lift the Bulls past
the Panthers soccer team 1-0 at
Pitt Stadium.

The loss marked the first time
all year that the Panthers have
failed to score a goal. It was
just the second time that Pitt

i

has been defeated at home this
season.

The Panthers, who dropped
to 8-4 overall, were not without
opportunities.

They put 15 shots on goal
against Buffalo netminder Eric
Lurie to make 10 saves. But
Panther Coach Joe Luxbacher
said he felt his team’s shots
were weak ones and that his
players let too many chances
slip through their ﬁngers.

-———— 

 

“We missed chances, and we
didn’t create a lot of really
good chances,” Luxbacher said.
“I think we had 15 shots, but I

don’t remember 15 good
shots.” .
Buffalo stuck with the

Panthers every step of the way
in the first half. Neither team
could find the net, but it was
the Bulls who dominated play
with relentless hustle and
aggressive defense.

“The first half we didn’t play
strong at all,” Luxbacher said. “I
thought that physically they
were beating us to the ball 
We didn’t play well defensive-
ly. We had lapses.”

In the second half it was
more of the same. The Panthers
did have an excellent chance to
score just two and a half min-
utes into the second session,
when Panther midfielder J.L.
Gorsin set up Dean Astorino 10
yards in front of the goal.

Astorino, who scored both of
the Panthers’ goals in Pitt’s 2-0
win over Carnegie Mellon on
Wednesday, fired a header over
the oustretched arms of Bulls’
goalkeeper Lurie. The ball
bounced off the top of the
crossbar as the game remained
scoreless.

Buffalo had a chance of its
own just five minutes later
when first-year forward
Durante split right through the
Panther defense and put a shot
right on Pitt goalie Adam
Spitzer. ,

Durante.

But Durante and the Bulls
eventually prevailed with the
Niagara Falls, Ontario, native
putting Pitt away with 14:45 to
go in the game. Durante took a
pass near midfield from senior
Chris Evans and raced right
past a slew of Panther defend-
ers with a breakaway.

Spitzer came far out of the
net to challenge Durante, but
the Buffalo forward put it right
past the sprawling netminder
for the only goal the Bulls
would need.

Durante said that his team,
which defeated another Big
East club — Syracuse
University — earlier this sea-
son, was better prepared to
play the Panthers because it
played the Orangemen earlier
in the year.

“They play the same style of

play,” Durante said. “They like

to open up the field. It helped r

us by playing Syracuse first
because we were used to that
style of play  It helped us a
lot.”

had a week ago against
Maryland,” Hackett said. “Both
of their quarterbacks found
ways to escape and make big
plays. I think that really was
the tell-tale sign.” _

Holtz sent out his second

offensive unit for its next pos-

session. Lee Becton ripped off
a 27-yard run into Pitt territory.
Two plays later, backup QB
Kevin McDougal escaped a
rush_ and found Derrick Mays
for a 31-yard touchdown.

, Pitt, in an attempt to get back
in the game, tried a trick play.
It didn’t work. Cliff Moncrief

tried a receiver pass from the‘

left side, but Tom Carter inter-
cepted the poorly thrown
ﬂoater for the Irish.

Notre Dame drove 82 yards
right through the Panthers to
finish the first—half scoring.

defensive line from two yards

Call

Continued from page 7

stunned, I didn’t see it [the
penalty] Clearly. I looked at the
incomplete pass and was think-
ing about the next play.”

The crucial penalty that
Hackett did not see came with
five minutes left in the third
quarter — a quarter that Pitt
had dominated until the
untimely call. _,

On a third-and—nine play,
Mirer faded back and was
forced out of’ the pocket.
Seeing nothing open down-
field, the Notre Dame quarter-
back tried to ‘throw the ball to
his tight end Irv Smith. But the
ball fell helplessly behind Smith
for an incomplete pass. At the
same moment, Pitt outside line-
backer Dell Seagraves hit Mirer
and the yellow ﬂags ﬂew.

Amidst the sounds of jeering
Pitt fans, Notre Dame got the
automatic first down and
promptly scored a touchdown
six plays later. That made the
score 35-14 in favor of the
Irish.

The Panthers, who could

_ have gotten control of the ball

at 28-14 with the momentum
on their side, was now left
drained" after the crushing

I defensive penalty.

The penalty was questionable
because of the momentumﬂlat
Seagraves had when he went
to tackle Mirer. Could he have
stopped himself and not hit
Mirer? The officials thought he
could and made the call.

“Without that roughing—the-
passer caIl,ﬂ they had us
stopped,” Notre Dame head
coach Lou Holtz said. “Pitt

played very tough defensively.”

“I just felt they couldn’t stop
us [offensively],” Hackett said.
“If we get the ball back [with-
out the penalty], take the
momentum away, I know we
could keep it.”

Imagine the game if the
penalty had never happened.
Notre Dame would have punt-
ed, and at that point Pitt had a
good chance to score. Panther

quarterback Alex Van Pelt was '

passing well, and his offense
was moving the ball at will. If
Pitt would have scored, making
it 28-21,»it would have been
anyone’s‘ game in the fourth
quarter.

History would have been on
the Panthers’ side, too. Notre
Dame has fallen apart in the
secondhalf of big games_ the
past three seasons —— losing to
Penn State (1990), Tennessee
(1991) and Stanford (1992). The
Irish Had solid halftime leads in
each of these games and ended
up on the losing side of all
three. Pitt might have added
another name to that list if it
were not for the roughing—the-
passer penalty.

But it did not happen. The
“ifs” and “buts” did not come
through for the Panthers. Pitt
lost the momentum and Notre
Dame gained it.

Pitt lost the ball and Notre
Dame had it. Pitt lost on the
scoreboard and Notre Dame
won, convincingly too, 52-21.

“Football is a game of
momentum,” Hackett said.

“Once they [Notre Dame] g‘o:’i£'"

[the momentum] we were
cooked.”

Continued from page 8
out to make the score Notre
Dame 28 - Pitt 6.

Pitt came out ﬂying in the
second half. A suddenly hard-
hitting defense shut down
Notre Dame on three downs.

Van Pelt led the Panthers on
a 78-yard scoring drive. The
senior quarterback hit seven of
eight passes for 54 yards on the
drive,’ including a-five—yard
scoring pass to Jells.

The defense stopped the
Irish again as Mirer threw
incomplete on third down. A

.roughing call kept the drive

alive and Notre Dame took

October Zlith

advantage. Mirer took a keeper.

around the right end for 20
yards ‘and Bettis blasted for 17
yards to set up a 10-yard touch-
down run by Bettis putting
Notre Dame back in control of
the game.

After a Van Pelt interception,
Mays scorched the Pitt sec-
ondary for a 69-yard scoring
reception.

Pitt had one answer left as
Van Pelt hit Askew for an
eight-yard touchdown.

Notre Dame tacked on a 42-
yard Craig I-Ientrich field goal
and a 4—yard touchdown by
Paul Failla.
