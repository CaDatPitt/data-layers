WASHINGTON — The
Democratic—control|ed Senate
Judiciary Committee yesterday
sent Robert H. Bork’s Supreme
Court nomination to the Senate
floorwith a recommendation that
it be rejected.

The 9-5 vote came as President
Reagan vowed anew to continue
his fight for Bork’s nomination.

But chances for confirmation

‘dimmed further when a key con-

servative Democrat said, ”I must
vote no,” and a fifth Republican
senator announced his oppo-
sition.

Senate urges Bork rejection   I

Sen. Howell Heflin, D—Ala., an-

nounced his decision during the
committee debate just before the
vote. -
Hef|in’s opposition was
particularly troublesome for the
White House, which hoped for a
favorable vote from the former
chief justice of the Alabama
Supreme Court to sway other
conservative southern Democrats
to Bork’s side.

The committee roll call fell
roughly along party lines, with
GOP Sen. Arlen Specter of Penn-
sylvania joining eight Democrats
in voting against the nomination.
All five votes on the other side
were cast by Republicans.

The vote came after the com-

mittee rejected,ron an identical
9-5 roll call, a proposal to send
the nomination to the floor with

a recommendation that Bork’ be I

pected to vote later this month; ‘

Heflin said he was in a quan-

Bork was a ”conservative justice; _ .1.‘

”I’m reminded of the old say-i

According toa representative of Pitt's Gay and

march, ’’I’m glad to have the opportunity to march‘
for my rights and the rights of other lesbians and

take notice of us and our needs and realize we are
proud of what we are.” r

There are seven specific demands they are
making:

BAS to co-sponsor Jobs fair r

By Theresa Costello
Staff Writer - I

The University of Pittsburgh's
Black Action Society and the Na-
tional Society of Black Engineers
are working together to plan the
annualMinority Jobs Fair to be
held Thursday, Nov. 12 in the
William Pitt Stud_ent Union.

As part of Pitt's Annual Black
Week, the fair’s objective is to

-bring in close to 70 companies

that are looking to recru_it minori-
ty students.

”The goal of the fair is to pro-
mote minority recruitment on
campus,” said Kathleen Valen-
teen, one of the coordinators of
the event. ’’Although we have a
placement service on campus,
records show that most black stu-
dents don’t use’ it.”

VaIenteen- said it was n_ot the

V fault» of the. placement serv_ice,T_ r
-'ho.we.v'e‘r.» ‘ ’  '

  
 

NSBE and BAS split the job of
planning the fair by allowing the
NSBE to contact the technical
companies and BAS to handle the
non-technical companies.

Some of the companies sched-
uIed~are IBM, AT&T, Goodyear,
Westinghouse, Philadelphia Gas
Co., KDKA TV and Nationwide
to name a few.

Valenteen said, ”We’re hoping
for 300 to 400 students to attend
the fair. To them, we're saying,
here are 70 companies coming,
willing to recruit minority stu-
dents. To the companies, we tell
them here are the studentswi|I—
ing to apply.”

_- The fair is open to all minority
students from all the area col-
leges, not just Pitt.

According. to Valenteen, the‘

:cor'-nmittee planning thefair con-
tacted other black government

  

ed their
hatham.

  

amd Carlow. _

”Many of the BAS’members,-.' .
belong to the Greek system, and
so we've contacted minorityif 
Greeks this way,” Valenteen’

commented. I

The BAS and NSBE are not
bringing the students in unpre—_i_
pared, either. Throughout this fall

semester, they have offered semi-

nars on how to write‘ a resume I i
and other ways to help secure a .  a

job.

Later in October, a seminar is _ _
being sponsored featuring Carlfi‘ 
Hooks from Allegheny Ludlum‘
Steel on interviewing techniques, ,

”For the fair, we are advocat-
ing proper dress and for the-stu- 
dents to bring resumes,” said -» "

WASHINGTON — The Inter-

nal Revenue Service falsely-

placed a tax lien on "President and
Mrs. Reagan this year because of

3‘ ‘ 'a trainee’s miscue in Texas, the
 JRS said Tuesday.

Though the error was caught
and corrected, the phony lien re-
mains a permanent entry in the
agency's computer files, a
spokesman added. "

As reported by the Kiplinger

.'Tax Letter, an IRS official was

demonstrating the agency's elec-
tronic lien system during a sum-
mer training class in Austin,
Texas, and used the president's
name as an example despite an
IRS policy that real names, espe-

_ cially those ofV|Ps, not be used.

The demonstration itself
caused no problems. But after the
class, a_trainee, practicing what

‘ she was shown, hit the wrong

buttons on her computer ‘and
thereby recorded a tax lien
against the president at the Tra-
vis County courthouse.

IRS spokesman Rod Young
confirmed the episode and said
the agency has taken steps to see

 

there is no recurrence. He point-
ed out that the ”Ronald Reagan”
computer entry had been accom-

panied by a bogus Social Securi-

address, so the lien ”wouldn’t
have had any effect anyway.”

Soviets say U.S. plans

MOSCOW — Soviet officials
said Tuesday that U.S plans to

to defend his government's
policy.

Over the weekend, diplomats
participating in the Geneva talks
on a chemical weapons ban were
flown to the Shikhany military
base in central Russia, where they

Alas, that love and- loyalty for

Imagine. If you were to take ev-
ery single book from the Hillman
Library and set them side by side,
they would extend from the front
steps of the Library to the front
steps of the White House in
Washinton, D.C. — 236 miles of
books.

MERRITT

NEAI-E JR.

Now imagine a freshman trying

to walk from here to the White '

House, without a map. When it
comes to finding what you need
in the library, it's tough. Especial-
Iy for freshmen. Unfortunately I,
too, have been labeled ”fresh-
man,” and as all freshmen know,
we hate to look stupid.

So, as we yvalk into Hillman
Library, we just pray to God we
find what we are in search of. Of
course, there is a library guide
somewhere. But you need a
guide to find the guide — that's
efficiency for you;

Rule one. of the library states,
"Ask for help.” Rule one of the
“How not to act like a freshmen”

, handbook states, ”Never' ask for
help.”

Rule two of the library guide
states, ”Take a tour.” Rule two of
the freshmen handbook states,
”Take a look at those who take
the tours.” Back to square one, as
far as being hip goes.

Then there are the micro—fiche.
I still haven't figured out how
people can read such small print-
ing. I prefer tuna—fiche.

Pittcat. Now here is something
great. Just enter your subject, and
you get a title and location. Easy?

I'm a freshmen. Nothing’s easy.

The hunt begins. I travel
through_a maze of 15-foot-high
book shelves, in search of a book
entitled The Bush Man ofKenya.

I mumble a couple of pro-
fanities. V

The eyes of everyone there fo-
cus on me. The whispers flow
throughout the library. I hear
”Freshmen! They should be
shot!“ from two blond female
students.

I give then an injured-dog look,
but they show no -"sympathy.

There is no sympathy for the lost _

freshman.
I'm sure the Bush Man of
Kenya would have an easier time"

finding a book here than I would _

have. I say to myself, ”Swal|ow
your pride. Ask for help.’.’
Never!

Claire is somewhat of an enig-

like her husband and Claire, she
is satisfied with her life; When
her husband is unfaithful, she
tells him to move his stuff out of
the house while going to target
practice to defend herself now
that she is alone.

There are many beatiful shots

The woman Keegan is assigned

the one character in the story

that the characters are not likea-
ble. Keegan is weak. He does not

There is nothing terribly wrong
with this movie; there is just noth-

depressingly dull. It is a wholly

ing characters and an overused
storyline of the unfaithful
husband.

Maybe Ridley Scott should try
science fiction again.

Voice from

1  By Michele Kiraly

Assistant Entertainment‘ Editor

I dreamed the other night that the only
thing The Silencers wanted to talk about
in an interview was American politics.
This weird notion came over, I think, af-

b ter reading the band's polished RCA bio

which stated their political consciousness.
Luckily, though, the only speech this

1. band will make is a thank you at the end

of -a song. As vocalist Jimme O'Neill put
it, "We're musicians, not politicians.”
The band of four Scots, now transplant-

bed to London, gave a rocking perfor-

mance with Boston's Dumptruck at the

4 . Upstage last Wednesday. If you missed

it, which many folks did as the crowd
numbered only about 100, that's just your
-tough luck.

Pittsburgh was one stop on the band's
American tour that started last month and
will wind up somewhere in the South
sometime in December.

‘O'Neill, former guitarist for. the pop
band Fingerprintz, teamed up with band
member Cha Burns, a bassist, Joe Donel—
ly and Martin Hanlin to form the
Silencers. O'Neill wanted to keep the

' band all Scottish with hopes the ethnic

ties would insure similar interests.

Their main concentration was to write
good songs. They did that and managed
to avoid playing the London bar scene by
sending out some really good. demo
tapes. They had the record companies
chasing them instead of the other way
around. As O'Neill said, "We sort of in-
vented ourselves."

Silencers

A Letter from St. Paul is the band's first
release on RCA. It contains three tracks
from the original demo plus several more.

The music is emotional and atmospheric’

with long —guitar-laced introductions,
providing an uncluttered sound and
echoes of acoustic guitar. The band chose
the album title for its ambiguity; St. Paul
in the religious sense or St. Paul as the
midwestern city. They actually did
receive a fan letter from a girl in St. Paul.

Accents withstanding, these Silencers
are definitely Scottish. Don't confuse
them with a former local band by the
same name. I talked with O'Neill before
the show Wednesday.

Q: The Silencers’ music is described as
ceItic—style of rock 'n' roll with some
Blues influences. Why this combination?

A: We wanted the music to have a Scot-
tish soul to it, and we devised the guitar
sound to be part of that. The chord shapes
we use are drawn out, basically. We
change the cord by changing the bass line
and not the guitar chord. The guitar plays
the same, and that's sort of a celtic thing
to do. It was deliberate in our sound. Also,
my voice is not what we would call a rock
'n' roll voice. It's more like a folk voice.

I really started off playing folk and
blues. Our major influences are Scottish
and Irish folk music and late 1960's rock,
like the Doors and American Blues.

Q: There are outspoken political
themes in your songs, but you don't con-
sider yourselves to be activists.

A: Well, only in the sense that we are

musicians. You can touch on it as much
as you can. I'm not really politically ac-

‘ * 0 -- .,_ ,._;  ‘,_r 7.1!‘ ., ,  ‘...1,!,i’. ‘.E. v . .‘ 14;‘-

tive. The only politically active thing I've
ever done is to vote. But as a song writer,
and that's my own profession, you find
things coming into your songs that are
major issues. You can't ignore them.

I've always tried to put a sting into the
tail of those songs about what is happen-
ing. We definitely have got some things
to say. I think it's more successful if you
can say something political with a good
tune. It's not contrived; it's not something
that we thought heavily about. It just
comes naturally. _

Q: The songs offthe album seem to
have a poetic quality to them.

The lyrics I write, if you want to ap-
proach it from a poetic point of view,
which is really a celtic sort of thing to do.

After all, the Scotts and Irish are great

my writing. .

The song "Painted Moon" is actually
about the Falklands War. The line "An—
gels to the rescue" is the task force. That
hasa serious side to it, written in a poet-
ic way but not overtly political.

Q: Has‘ your songwriting changed
much since your days with Fingerprintz?

A: Yes, definitely. The Silencers’ stuff
is more melodic, more emotional. In Fin-
gerprintz, most of the song subjects be-

had a good sound. These songs are more

They're gracious, they look to be

well-suited to an LA rooftop.

Watching this video, I came up
with a few suggestions for these

other blonde should learn how to

wheezing, pot-bellied old men

Fingerprintz toured the U.S. about five
years ago. The record company we were
with was closing, so it was sort of a tour
on a shoe string. We made enough
money from the gigs just to pay for the
hotels. We're still remembered, though.
After someof The Silencers’ shows, peo-
ple come up to me with Fingerprintz al-
bums and say, can you play this? it's really

quite amazing.

For The Silencers, the radio support has
been great. ”Painted Moon" has been get-

When we begin to

come from darkness

The gay rights‘ movement was initiated in 1969 when gay
menfought the police at the Stonewall Bar in Greenwich Vil-
lage, N.Y., — refusing to be harassed and arrested in one of
the frequent police-raids on the gay bars. This historical event
began the nationwide fight against oppression of gays and
lesbians.

Since then, some steps have been made toward gay libera-
tion, but the movement has been stifled by the backlash of
homophobia stemming from AIDS and the conservative polit-
ics of the Reagan Administration.

In response to laws that have been upheld by the Supreme
Court rendering gay sex illegal and to the lack of legislation
protecting gays and lesbians in the workplace and in schools,
the gay community is again taking to the streets this Sunday,
Oct. 11, in the second national March on Washington.

In a country in which all men are said to be created equal,

gays and lesbians (roughly 25 million Americans) still hold a I

second-class citizenship that does not include the rights that
other minorites are granted. Even at the University of Pittsburgh,
gay students and faculty are not «protected by any of the dis-
claimers that promise other minorities security. ' k '

The march on Washington is a call to all people to reflect
on their values and recognize the existence, needs and inaliena-
ble rights of the gay and lesbian ‘community.

In anutshell

(editor of High -Frontiers)

And where shall

the rest be seated?

This is my fourth year at this fine university and my fourth football
season of having to put up with the Greek domination of the student
section. What gives the fraternities and sororities the right to section
off as many‘ seats as they want? If they have a contract, then I want
one too! i -

A non-Greek student would probably get thrown out of the stadi-
um for taping off all the bleachers! By the time we get there, we have
no hope of getting a half-decent seat. My boyfriend and I get there
an hour and a half before kickoff a_nd still have to take backseat to
the fraternities.

We pay just as much for our tickets as they do for theirs, and we
should have equal.opportunity to see the game from the best possi-
ble angle. If the Greeks want those seats so badly, tell them to get
thfere before the game and save the seats for themselves, like the rest
0 us do. . i i

OK, listen up. It's time for a po-
litical free-association test. Hart:

sex. Biden: plagiarism. Schroed— .

er: tears. Dukakis: tattletale. Po-
litics: yuck.
Not one of these characteriza-

tions is fair, not even the last one.

Not one of these labels says any-
thing about ideas, about govern-
ing, about the seriousness of the
post of president. But they do say
something about the campaign of
1987. As a Boston wag put it, ”In
politics, one day ‘you're a pea-

»cock and the next day you're a

featherduster.” --

This has been a breathtaking
and depressing couple of weeks.
Weeks that leave a bad taste in
the mouth. The orator of the cam-
paign trail, Joe Biden, got caught
wearing someone else’s words.
The woman who brought some
verve to the debate, Pat Schroed-
er, dropped out in tears. Now, the
squeaky-clean governer, Mike
Dukakis, has been tarnished by
his closest aide. -

Not all disappointments are
equal.‘ Not all political crimes re-
quire the same punishment. But
this is a merciless campaign; it
seems that every misdemeanor
ends up with somebody calling
for capital punishment.

On a scale of one to 10, Hart's
mistakes get aboutan eight, Bi-
den’s about a five and Dukakis’
no more than a two. But on a

was found guilty of spreading the
truth. He distributed the famous
”attack tape” that showed Joe Bi-
den doing Neil Kinnock without
credits. Call it dirty pool or hard-
ball, it was a minor offense. It

‘only entered the major leagues

when, ironically, Sasso lied about

his role in spreading that truth.

As for the governor himself,
Dukakis was guilty by as_socia—
tion, guilty of not knowing and
then, some of my colleagues say,
guilty of indecision. He didn't fire
Sasso immediately. In the instant
time frame of modern politics,
four hours of uncertainty about
dumping a man who has been
your closest aide and friend for
seven years is considered in-
decisive.

Dukakis will suffer because this
video escapade chips away at his
strongest image and self-image:
that of stiff-necked, even judg-
mental, integrity. He is being
judged against himself.. And
maybe that is the peculiar and un-
settling dynamic of this season.

Pat Schroeder likes to say that
she wasn't running for the post of
Mother Teresa. Nor is anybody

‘ "running against Mother Teresa.

Indeed, these candidates aren't
really running against anyone yet.
Except themselves.

This endless, slogging, non-
campaign isstill in its preliminary
show—and-tell phase. Not a vote
has been cast or will be cast for
four months. The main event is
13 months away.

When the voters get closer to
election day, they make real-life
decisions about the relative
strengths and weaknesses of real
people. In a two or even three-
person race, we compare flaws.
But in a sis-man race, we simply
highlight flaws. We don't get to
ask whether’ Biden’s plagiarism is
a greater sin than, say, Haig’s
militarism. We just get to watc
the plagiarism. « - A .
The end result is that nay; can-

 

crack in himself or his campaign, I‘

is found greviously wanting. He
loses to some arbitrary standard
of perfection before he even has
a chance to run against another

imperfect opponent. He is cons-_

tantly running against himself.

In this saga of sinning and 1‘

stumbling candidates, the media
has become a major player. By

presenting a haphazard sequence ’

of flaws — la_rge and small —-in
full and brutal glare, we become
an electronic screening system.‘
We run a primary of our own.

Any troubled campaign, any. can— __A

didate singed by his own or his

staff's misfire, becomesthe butt. .
of the same in-joke: Stick a fork -

in him, he's done.

Is every flaw fatal? Have we I

lost the capacity to distinguish be-
tween lethal injury — something
that disqualifies a man from the
Oval Office — and a surface
blow? If I had to triage the mis-
takes of Hart, Biden and Dukakis,
which plugs would I pull. Hart?
Yes. Biden? Maybe. Dukakis? No.

But today, every trouble draws
blood. We used to talk about
winners in politics. We used to

- focus on election day. This year,

this brutal year, we talk about sur-

vivors. Can anyone make it to . - 

election day?

ment of film and all it has to offer
more than him.

The reason I mention this is be-
cause, as I have stated, this movie
was personally enjoyable. One of
the tenets my friend holds tightly
is that realism in film is not essen-
tial. ’’If you want realism,” he
would say, ”you can walk down
Forbes Avenue any night of the
week.”

Film, though many would ar-
gue against it, is an art. It is a
medium which can express
almost any emotion, activity,
thought or abstract concept. It
has, like all other art forms, works

that are hideously bad and others-

that are exceptionally good.
Big Shots is a film that falls

somewhere in between those
. broad classifications. '

It is not—let me state this and
expound upon it later—a realis-
tic film. It is an enjoyable film that
appeals to the heart instead of the
mind. ’

I do not want to dwell on the
faults of this movie for they are
easy enough to spot. I do want to
give a, few examples and then
show why they do not affect the
feel of the story. ‘

The two heroes of the movie

A (Ricky Busker and Darius

McCrary) hot wire a $70,000
Mercedes then hide it in a garage.
Later they return to the car and
start it with no hot wiring equip-

isn't that big of a deal on screen ’

ment. The keys must. have
miraculously appeared. Busker’s
character is riding his bike peace-
fully down a suburb street one
instant and the next is pedaling
along Lakeshore Drive in down-
town Chicago. The boys carry toy
guns that McCrary’s character
bought yet one of them shoots
real bullets.

These discrepancies do not af-
fect the vicarious feelings evoked
while watching the film. I was
still overjoyed by the ending; I
was still cringing slightly when
the two boys appeared to be in
trouble; I was still laughing at the
predicaments they found them-
selves in. --~._

The subplots of the story were
quietly, rather than melodramat-
ically, resolved. Mandel kept the
camera with the owner of the
Mercedes (a ”bad”guy) for a
reasonable amount of time. A
stern but kindly man (Paul Win-
field) added to the tenderness and
quiet resolutions of the story by
helping the boys when it was
thought he might not. He was the
best of the kindly characters
sprinkled throughout the film.

I had fun at this film which is I

what I intended to do.So what if
this film is not always realistic? It
moves quickly (it is only ninety
minutes), provides excitement,
evokes laughs and promises to be
a good time.

THE Pl'|'|' NEWS

 
  
 

The quarterback problem, for
Pitt's head football coach Mike

Gottfried is certainly not a new ’
one. In these his only two seasons.

as the head coach of the Panther
team, he has had to face situa-
tions where more than once he's
had to use a passer who had
either no experience or very lit-
tle talent.

Such is the case again.

’’Sometimes I just don't know
what we're going to do," said
Gottfried. ’’But I still have a lot of
confidence in Sal, and I know he
will eventually work his way
back up to the top again.”

But, the populace opinion‘

seems to be waning.

In an unofficial poll of 30 stu-
dents/Pitt football fans conducted
by The Pitt News, 90 percent felt
that Genilla simply is not doing
the job and that Gottfried should

.consider putting in his backup

passers to try and fill this quarter-

back gap. _ S
Comments about Genilla right

now range anywhere from, "He's

one of the sorriest excuses for a
quarterback ever,” to, ”Just get
him the hell out" of there.”

None of the quarterbacks -
Genilla, Larry Wanke, Darnell
Dickerson, Kieran Scanlon or
Dean El—Attrache —— could be
reached for comments.

But there are certai n players on
the team who do not feel Genil-
la needs any special attention or
removal.

Gottfried's choices for quarterback: Sal Genilla (center), Dar-

said whoever he picks will be decided upon during this week's

”He’s doing the best he possi-
bly can right now,” said Pitt's
mainstay powerhouse player
Craig Heyward, who is literally
Genilla’s right—hand man right
now. ”l really wish some people
would get off of his back. That's
one job that can't be taken light-
ly on a football team at all. Hey,

0 How's this for a quick fix? If

Pitt (3-2) beats fourth-ranked
Notre Dame (3-0) this weekend
— which, incidentally, will be the
first time that the Panthers have
gone into a contest as the under-
dog all season — the fading bowl
picture suddenly brightens up a
whole heckuva lot for Mike Gott-
fried’s unsure squad. Representa-

Cotton, Fiesta, New(?) Peach and
Florida Citrus Bowls will all be on

what 1987 brought was a false

prophecy that finished 37 games '

out of first place, with over 100
losses.

0 If the league counts these
strikebreaker games in regular
season records, the New York Gi-
ants will be 0-3 and counting -
the first time ever that a defend-

the rest of the better franchises

deserve a better fate.

0 Here's an interesting idea for
the networks to consider while
they suffer through the strike:

lronhead

is still

looking good as
Panthers approach
the halfway point

By Sam Tallarico

' Assistant Sports Editor

For junior tailback Craig ”lron-
head” Heyward, looking back
can almost be as painful as look-
ing ahead.

”When you look at the Temple
and Boston College game, you
say, ’Why didn't Pitt win?’ Those
two games we should of won
without a doubt,” said Heyward.

”Those two losses being close

hurt the team a lot. We need this .-
one [Notre Dame] bad. This is a ‘

game we have to win if we want

to go to a bowl game,” he added.=

That statement may serve as an
added incentive to the team. Not

only do they want to win, they '
are now at a point where they

have to win. But it's not as if Hey-
ward hasn't done his part.

Heyward is ranked seventh in
the country rushing, averaging
129.6 yards per game and is 13th
overall in all—purpose yardage
with 155 a game. He is currently
eighth on the all—time Panther
rushing list with 1,943 yards.

If he can maintain his game
average, he would jump to num-
ber four, moving past Panther
greats Warren Heller, Marshall
Goldberg, Joe McCall and

Charles Gladman. And he still
has a season-and—a-half to go.
’’I love carrying the ball -
that’s myjob. Sure, I get tired. l’m
not a robot running on premium

gas, but you get your stamina. 5

You get tired until you get your
second wind,” Heyward said.

Offensively, the problem lies
with the recent downfall of quar-
terback Sal Geni|la’s perfor-
mance. He started the season off
with a bang, rolling up 633 yards
passing and six touchdowns.

However,- in the last two
games, Genilla has 210 passing,
four interceptions and no touch-
downs. While many of the fans
have given up on Genilla, Hey-
ward hasn't.

”S_al’s done an excellent job.
He just has to release the ball. I
know his confidence and his
eagerness are still there. Being a
quarterback is hard. Throwing
through defenders is real hard,”
said Heyward.

The upcoming game against
Notre Dame will be a homecom-
ing of sorts. It marks the Pitts-
burgh return of one Serafino
”Foge” ‘Fazio, former Panther
head coach from 1982-85. Hey-
ward looks forward to his brief

”lt’s a special game, playing
against your [former] head coach
and their [Notre Dame] tradi-

undefeated, if we come out with
a win, it'll mean more.”

When told that Fazio consi-
dered him the best back in the
land, the modest Heyward re-

against the defense which gives
up only 99 yards rushing per

”They come out with a basic
defense. Notre Dame has big
defensive linemen, and their line-

defense. I expect a lot from
them,” Heyward said.

ent than us. They're in the second
year of a coaching transition. If
everyone does what they are sup-
posed to do, I can't see why we
won’t win,” added Heyward.

Winning isn't something the
Panthers have seen much of late-
ly, losing two out of the last three
games. When Gottfried shoul-
dered the blame for last week's
poor offensive performance, Hey-
ward wouldn't hear of it.

”What we're worried about,
what we're concerned about is
executing. He's not out there

playing, we are. When we won '

the first two games, everyone was
relaxed.

’’All through the field we run,
but once we get inside the
20-yard line, we pass. When you
pass inside the 20, you pass for
a touchdown. We have to work
hardon patterns,” Heyward said.

Heyward realizes the incon-

sistencies this team has, and once .

it overcomes that, then the victo-
ries will come.

”We have to concentrate on
what we have to do. We have not
put a whole game together. If we
do, we can win the game,” said
Heyward.

Hammond gives soccer team young blood

By Mike Milliron

For The Pitt News

One of the most overlooked
players on the University of Pitts-
burgh soccer team is defensive
midfielder Bryan Hammond.

Sophomore Hammond started
in this position as a freshman last
year. His responsibilities are to
play man-to—man defense against
the opponent's trailing forward or
their center midfielder while try-
ing to pass the ball to his own
center and midfielder.

Pitt head soccer coach Joe Lux-
bacher praised his young player
highly. -

”Bryan is a good, solid player.
He wins the ball really well for
us,” said Luxbacher. ”Even

though we have a young team,

he's one of our more experienced
players.”

While at Trinity High School in
Washington, Pa., he was center
midfielder, and he had less defen-
sive and man-to—man duties there
than at Pitt.

Hammond feels that the transi-
tion from high school soccer to
Division 1 college soccer wasn't
that difficult for him, even though
he's playing a different position.

”It’s definitely more physical,
but I like that.” said Hammond.

Though the team is struggling
a little through injuries and a 3-4
record, Bryan maintains a good
winning-attitude. He feels that no
one, good, tackle, pass or steal
makes a game. It's thegoverall ef-
fort that counts.

,”If I feel I could have done bet-
ter in a game or didn't give 100
percent, I'll never be satisfied,”
said Hammond. ”Nothing mat-
ters except whether you do the

Strike talks resume

By Dave Goldberg

AP Football Writer

NEW YORK (AP) ~ NFL’
strike negotiations resumed
Tuesday after the union
softened its stance on free
agency, leading some players
to predict regulars would be
back, on the field this
weekend.

The talks, the first in II
days, involved only the chief

negotiators — management's
Jack Donlan and the union's
Gene Upshaw. The site was
undisclosed.

The new talks also followed
a weekend in which both
sides seemed to lose -—i own-
ers, because stadiums were
filled to just 25 percent capac-
ity rather than the usual 90
percent; players, because of
nearly 90 ‘defections

team, he's one of our more experienced players.

job or not.”

Hammond visited and was
recruited by universities like
Akron, Georgetown, Bucknell
and West Virginia. Obviously he
chose Pitt over those other
schools. ,

”I really like the administration
of justice program here at Pitt,”
said Hammond.

When he graduates, Bryan
would like to join the FBI or be-
come a private investigator.

”Everyone has to go to high

My criminology classes are excit-

Pitt is also relatively close to
Bryan's home town of

Washington.

of the games,” said Hammond.

Bryan's brother plays at IUP —
a team Pitt plays later this season.

”My parents have always
strongly supported me,” said
Hammond.

Hammond is very happy with
the way things are going for him
at the university.

”I like my classes, coach, team
and friends here at Pitt,” he said.

Luxbacher was a big influence
in Bryan's coming here as well as

- his staying here.

”I admire Coach Luxbacher’s
composure, he doesn't yell
much, and if he feels you're not
reaching your potential, he tells
you straight out,” he said.
