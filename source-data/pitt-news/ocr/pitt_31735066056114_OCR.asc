monitor the pattern closely. If they
were to see a trend or related inci-
dents, they would issue a crime alert
for the area. On Saturday between 3
a.m. and 11:30 a.m., a 1990 four-door
Jeep was stolen from the PS Lot on
Fifth Avenue and University Place.

Proposed sites

for convocation

Center reviewed

Byjack Finn

Asst. News Editor

The appearance of the Pitt campus in the year
2014 is slowly taking shape, with a site near Pitt

Stadium as a possible location for the new convoca— ‘

tion center.

The five-, 10- and 20-year master plans for cam-
pus expansion, required by the city of Pittsburgh by
next summer, were revealed yesterday afternoon at
the Senate Plant Utilization and Planning Committee
meeting.

Potential positives and negatives for the different
locations of the proposed convocation center were
reviewed by Director of Facilities Management Ana
Guzman. —

The three sites being considered by the university
are the Schenley parking lot between Forbes Quad
and the Carnegie, the OC lot adjacent to the stadium
and the practice football field near Cost Hall on the
upper campus.

“The site adjacent to the stadium is the most excit-
ing at this time,” Guzman said. “It wouldprovide
a shared concourse with the stadium and possess

' the least problems in disrupting the immediate

area.”

The convocation center could be built in
the space presently occupied by Pennsylvania Hall,
the Mineral Industrial Building and several fraternity
houses.

However, Guzman said that behind the stadium
is the favored location at this time. The center

would connect Trees Hall, the Field House and.

Salk Hall with the stadium/convocation center com-
plex.

“The concourse between the two structures could
have food vendors and other stalls that would be
available all the time,” Guzman said.

Construction of the $35 million convocation cen-

‘ ter, partially funded by the state through Project‘

Jump Start, cannot begin until a master plan is sub-
mitted to the city.

Underground and above ground sketches of the 9

center at the Schenley parking lot were shown,
along with how the construction would displace the
adjacent streets. _ '

“It is still an alternative, but it has many prob-
lems,” Guzman said.

The underground location would require the
demolition of a bridge that was buried years ago,
according to Guzman. That site could also invite
lawsuits to uphold the use of the property, as deed-
ed by Mary Schenley, for public use by the residents
of Pittsburgh. I

The practice field site posed problems with the

intern‘Heather Hines told the
Inter-Fraternity Council last
night how it could help a termi-
nally-ill child “momentarily for-
get the pain and sadness inﬂict-
ed on them and their family”
through involvement in the
Wishmaker on Campus pro-
gram.

Hines’ presentation at the

opening IFC meeting of the fall
semester urged Pitt fraternity
chapters to consider the Make-
A-Wish Foundation when
choosing a charity for philan-
thropic events.

“This is a tremendous oppor-
tunity to make a large impact on
a person’s life,” IFC President
Jeremy Weiss said.

“Individual houses can raise
moneyand hopefully provide
someone with a fond and last-
ing memory.”

According to Hines, soccer
matches, auctions and dance-a-
thons were successful Make-A-
Wish fund-raising ventures at
other colleges around
Pennsylvania, such as
Pennsylvania State University.

Hines was one of two fea-
tured speakers at the meeting.
Matt Cavanaugh, former Pitt

9 quarterback who led Pitt to the

1976 National Championship
and current tight end coach for
Pitt football head -coach John

Majors’ staff, spoke on behalf of

‘Majors and Pitt football.

“It is not just the staff and
players that win games. We
need fans to rally around the
team,” Cavanaugh said.

“Some of your fondest memo-
ries of college will be of athletic
events.”

Cavanaugh said the Greeks
are an important source of sup-
port for Pitt football and should
feel like a part of the football

community.

He said Majors and the staff ’

are interested in visiting with all
of the chapters to get to know
the members and answer any
questions they may have about
the Pitt football program.

president of IFC, said the

Pittsburgh Action Against
Rape depends highly upon the
support of its college-age vol-
unteers, who PAAR Executive
Director Molly Knox describes
as “pretty smart, pretty skilled,

‘ highly gutsy women making a

difference in their community.”

PAAR offers help for victims
of rape and sexual assault and
also provides the opportunity
to gain valuable experience by
volunteering.

“I think PAAR would not exist

without thesupport of college-
age students,” Knox said.
' “A lot of the energy over our
21 years of existence has
been provided by college stu-
dents.”

PAAR, located on Pittsburgh’s
South Side, serves 3,500 new
clients a year through its 24-
hour confidential hot" line, med-
ical and legal advocacy and

counseling programs.

PAAR has an active corps of
about 200 volunteers who
attend a 12-week, 40-hour
training program following a
preliminary interview.

According to Knox, the pur-
pose of the interview is “to
determine whether the individ-
ual has an interest in the ser-
vices that PAAR provides and
can help victims heal from the
trauma of rape and sexual
assault.”

Volunteers frequently work
as hot line counselors and sex-
ual assault prevention educa-

tors. Knox describes volunteers —

as people who want “to "work
against violence and make a
difference in the quality of life
in the community.” 9

Knox said there is no typical
volunteer.

“We don’t have such a thing.‘

I guess most of our volunteers
are looking to make a differ-
ence.

"They want to be in a place
where they can do some hands-
on work,” Knox said. “They’re
young and old  They are curi-
ous about the world and have

some real energy to make a

change.

“[PAAR is] a place where peo-
ple can learn a good deal about
empowerment,-” Knox said.
“The reality of our work is we
spend our time and energy
working with people who have
been ‘traumatized in one way or
the other e and we all l1ave
been in one way or another,”
Knox said.

Knox said she worked for 13
years with domestic violence
before her involvement at
PAAR.

“I asked my friend who did

the best women’s work in

Pittsburgh, and she said PAAR,”
Knox said.

PAAR also serves the commu-
nity through education and
training programs.

PAAR workers support vic-
tims of all ages and genders
from the hospital to the court-
room. Short- and long-term
counseling is also offered, as
well as individual and group
therapy.

Two years ago PAAR Volun-
teers raised nearly $2 million in
funds to purchase the house in
which PAAR is now located, at
81 South. 19th Street.

“lThe building is] beautiful,
it’s welcoming, it’s healing and
it’s wonderful,” Knox said. '

The PAAR 24-hour confiden-
tial hot line number is 765-2731»,
and the office number is 431-

Volunteer training sessions
are held twice a year and the
next session begins Sept. 20.

Anyone interested in volun-
teering at PAAR is encouraged
to call and set up an interview
with volunteer coordinator
Ellen Kerr at 431-5665 two
weeks before training.

well as unity between
‘black faculty and students
on this campus,” BAS
Public _ Relations

v to be a successful year for
blacks at Pitt.”

lot of students come out
and take part,” said
Oronde Sharif, BAS

activities but especially in
BAS.

It’s Carol’s first day of- college.
Her parents and younger broth-
er just pulled away in the family
car and are headed back home.
They were here since yesterday
helping Carol get situated in her
room in Tower A.

She stops to chat with another
student before going to her
room. In a few hours, she will
be eating her lunch.

Will it be in the Tower’s cafe-
teria, at the new food court in
the Student Union or at one of

. the many fast food restaurants

in Oakland? Or will Carol just
skip lunch?

Many students will have to
make these decisions. Why not
have a game plan for eating? To

moderation. One or two slices
of pizza is moderation, a whole
pie isn’t. just
as a cup of
ice cream is
moderation,
a quart isn’t.

what your goals are. Your pri-

Even with the best game plan

when you will deviate from it. ‘

Limit them to special occasions
and holidays.

The third goal, being able to
enjoy eating, is difficult for
some students.

For them, eating is often
accompanied by guilt, fear of
gaining weight and feeling they
are “bad” or out of control.
These feelings are commonly
associated with certain foods,
such as pizza, hamburgers, ice

Hundredssign up to rush sororities, fraternities pm HEMP

By Matt Groff

Asst. News Editor

With less than a week left
before rush begins, Pitt fraterni-

ties and sororities are gearing

up for what Inter-Fraternity
Council rush Chairperson
Michael Dejesus said will be a
very successful rush.

“IFC has almost 350 students
signed up for rush,” Dejesus

said. “Our goal is to reach 400 A

by the end of the week.”

Formal rush begins this Friday
for sororities and Monday for
fraternities. According to
Dejesus, Greek chapters will
now start to focus on recruiting
for their individual houses.

“Up to this point, we’ve been
putting emphasis on ‘going
Greek,” Dejesus said. “When
rush starts on Monday, the indi-
vidual activities will begin.”

Kappa Delta rush Chairperson

Jennifer Scott said her sorority is
excited about a new pledge
education program presented at
the Kappa Delta national con-
vention this summer which will
be used by chapters around the
country.

“Our new program is about
helping students better adjust to
college life,” Scott said.

She also said rushees will
have more opportunities to
become immediately involved

with the Panhellenic Council.
LuAnn Pantalo, president of
Kappa ‘Kappa Gamma, said her
sorority has been preparing for
rush by holding rush work-
shops for members. She also
said there is an advantage to the
earlier rush schedule this year.
“Since school has just started,
rush won’t be interfering with
any exams,” Pantalo said.

, questioning of

club strives

for respect

By Dan Goldberg
For The Pitt News

Gaining the recognition
and respect that any other
student group would.

— expect isthe main goal of

the Help End Marijuana
Prohibition organization
this year, according to
HEMP President Steven
Abate.

At HEMP’s opening
meeting of the year
Tuesday night, Abate said
the group encourages
the
nation’s drug laws.
According to a HEMP
pamphlet, marijuana or
hemp, is a victim of preju-
dice and misinformation.

“Up until the 1820s, you
could pay your taxes in
hemp,” Abate said.

“Even today,” he said,
“the biggest contributors
to anti-drug groups such
as Drug and Alcohol
Rehabilitation Education
are tobacco, pharmaceuti-
cal and alcohol corpora-
tions.”

Bonnie Kurtz, the
founder of Pittsburgh
National Organization to-
Reform Marijuana Laws (a
national decriminalization
group), said that 10 per-
cent of all people have an
“addictive personality,”
and if they don’t use mari-
juana, “they’re going to
find something else.”

HEMP, a Pitt group
since 1991, has published
a newsletter, sponsored
debates concerning rele-
galization and has had
field trips to decriminal-
ization conventions in
neighboring states.

For right now, Kurtz‘
said, “the most important
thing is to build a mem-
bership.” -

The 25 people who
attended the meeting
were angry that hemp,
despite all of its uses, is
illegal, while tobacco, a
drug with no documented
benefits and is known to
cause diseases, is avail-
able at virtually any time
at any place in the world.

Kurtz said marijuana is
known to help people
with AIDS, cancer, glau-
coma and other debilitat-
ing diseases because it
helps to quell nausea
and keeps the patient
from losing weight by
speeding the user’s
metabolism.

HEMP officers said they
are planning to distribute
a survey to the general
public with the intention
of finding out what the
average person thinks of
marijuana prohibition.

Game of kings, queens ‘addictive’ to students

By Rebecca Baker
Staff‘ Writer

Meticulous moves, hours of play and
intricate strategies all come together in the
name of fun for one Pitt club. “lChess] is
more of an addiction than it is anything
else,” Chess Club President Darrin Bond

i said.

“It’s the overall thought process lthat’s
addicting],” he said. “You use real life skills:
reasoning, spatial relations, math skills.”

“Chess is like basketball,” Bond said.
“We’re increasing a strength  it’s just a dif-
ferent type of exercise.”

Not only does the game sharpen one’s
logic skills, but according to Secretary
Andrew Smiley, the Chess Club is a way to
meet nice people with a common interest.

“Chess as a whole is full of good people,”
Smiley said. “It’s a great social activity for

' people who aren’t good at getting out

socially.”

If someone comes to the club with little
or no knowledge of the game, the club tries
to link that person up with someone of the
same level of skill or slightly better.

“We don’t have formal classes to teach
the game,” Chess Club business manager
Tom Martinak said. “We just divide players
into three levels: top, middle and bottom.
We found it’s the best way.”

The Chess Club became recognized as an
officially funded group at the University of
Pittsburgh in the late ‘70s, Martinak said.
The group currently has about 100 different
people who come off and on to the meet-
ing.

This semester the student government
board gave the group around $700 to
replace some of the boards ‘and pieces
which are nine and 10 years old.

“Some of our requests [such as a subscrip-
tion to Inside C/oess magazine] were

denied,” Martinak said. “But I know every-
one wants a lot of money [from 8GB], and I
know [the members] have to decide what’s
fair.”

Since Pitt prohibits the Chess Club to
compete like other university sports in offi-
cial competition, the group forms four to
five teams of about 10 players as a way to
play in. rated matches.

“One Sunday a month we sponsor a team
tournament,” said Martinak, “where we
have groups from all over the Pittsburgh
area compete.”

In official competition, players have 90
minutes to make 35 moves. “It forces peo-
ple to be serious and to take time to think
about their moves,” Martinak said “We’ve
won seven matches in the 25-year history of
the tournament. Most came in the 19805.”

To connect the majority of undergradu-
ates in the group with more advanced play-

gang aims
to clean

By Brian Lehew
For The Pitt News

' There’s a new gang in
the ‘hood. One that stays
sharp and disciplined. It’s
blazing through the city’s
parks and reclaiming
what belongs to it.

Children as young as
six have found a place
within this gang that
prides itself on hard
work, dedication and self-
respect. A

‘‘\We’re a gang  and
we want you to know all
the possibilities in this
world that are open to
you if you stay in school
and drug free,” Air
National Guard Major Jim
Lauria says to a handful of
young recruits from the
Garfield Heights chapter
of the Campfire Boys and
Girls and Sto/Ken/Rox
Boys and Girls Club.

These children have‘
joined forces with the city
of Pittsburgh, The United
Way and the Air National
Guard to
»Upper Panther Hollow

Park.

“Our kids like to volun-
teer. They"ve done work
for Adopt a Highway and
other projects,” said Boys
and Girls Club Program‘
Coordinator Bob Gruca.

But these children are
building much more than
projects. They’re building
character and learning

positive role models like
Technical Sergeant Keith
Stephens. He explains

is to stay in school and

CGS Council works to
change misconceptions

By Lisa DiMeno
For The Pitt News

The College of General Studies Student Government Council‘ is
striving to change some of the misconceptions and negative images
previously aligned with CGS. V

CGS often bears the stigma of being merely a “night-time school,”
CGS council member Deborah Vidmar said.

The council met last night and discussed its strategies for achiev-
ing the positive image the members said they feel CGS deserves.
One of the biggest steps the council is taking this semester is refor-
matting the CGS monthly publication First Degree, formerly called
The Night Times.

Changing the name is the first step the council took in improving
the image of the publication, according to council members.

“The Night Times perpetuated the idea that CGS was a night
school,” Vidmar said. .

Future plans for the publication include promoting services of
student affairs to CGS students, acknowledging academic excel-
lence and highlighting recent CGS events. ’ _, .

“Through the paper we can achieve objectives by talking about
past events that were successful, like the CGS open house,” Council
President Mary Anna Smith said.

Smith also said the initial feedback on thefirst issue of First
Degree has been very positive.

A new video has also been put together in an effort to make new
CGS students aware of the services and activities that are available
to them. B

Smith also plans on getting the message across that CGS students
are “consistently achievers” and that CGS "itself is very “service ori-
ented.”

Other topics of discussion included:

-Council plans to select a new member by Sept. 22. It is accept-
ing applications until Sept. 15.

-Plans to possibly make the CGS graduate dinner more of a cere-
mony and less like a dinner were discussed.

-Smith said she would like to get some additional times added to
the career counseling seminars.

She said the 6 p.m. to 7:15 p.m. seminars are impossible for CGS
students to attend.

Blmafoldmg, performing skits

allpozrt of leozrmrzgleozders/9z'p

By Susan Lanzendorfer
For The Pitt News

For the next few months,
194 first-yearlstudents will be
deciding who stays or goes
on a boat, who gets blindfold-
ed and who gets led around
campus, as well as perform-
ing skits in order to gain
knowledge about being a
campus leader.

As part of the Emerging
Leader program, students will
be engaging in these and
other skill-building‘ activities
for the next two semesters
under the watch of Joyce
Giangarlo, associate director
of the Office of Student
Activities.

The Emerging Leader pro-‘
gram, started in .1980 to
increase interest in Student
Government and other stu-
dent activities, began its 13th
year of instruction to first-year
students last night.“

“You make your education
by participation,” Student
Government Board President
Jacob Brody said.

Held in the William Pitt
Union Ballroom, students
were introduced to the goals

of the program and then—

broke into smaller groups led
by facilitators.

Some students had a clear
idea of what they wanted to
receive from the training pro-
gram.

“Leadership skills are neces-
sary to put my mark on the
community,” first—year student
Kristin Kenny said.

Erica Sentz joined for
another reason.

”I want to meet people, get
involved in university activi-
ties and still have fun,” she
said.

According to Maria Peluso,
graduate student assistant to
the Office of Student
Activities, the program has
proven to be successful in its
attempt to get students
involved in organizations at
Pitt. ,

She said it keeps students
involved in activities through-
out their college career.

She told students the pro-
gram will focus on “develop-
ing leadership skills and
working on yourself.”

Assertiveness, risk—taking
and trust building are just a
few of the areas to be cov-
ered by the facilitators.

Besides learning basic lead-

ership skills, Giangarlo said
students will “make a lot of
friends and get very comfort-
able at Pitt.”

Every year, the Emerging
Leader participants attend the
Meet the Candidates night for
the SGB to see how Pitt's stu-
dent election process is con-
ducted.

Giangarlo said students will
also “learn what’s important
to them and their group."

She said this gives students
a chance to discuss their
views on issues such as moti-
vation and stress management
with a group of people who
are going through the same
experiences.

According to Peluso, the
only requirements of the pro-
gram are — regular atten-
dance, participation in group
activities and each student
must join at least one of the
over 200 Pitt organizations.

The program will be held
from 6 p.m. to 8 pm. every
\X/ednesday for both fall and
spring terms.

For students interested in
participating in university life,
Peluso said, “It's well
worth the two hours every
week.”

completed by mid-1995.

The Historical Society,pro—

students and other historians
seeking documentation on
Western Pennsylvania’s social,
industrial, political and familial
history.

The need for more space has
arisen, according to Marilyn
El'WlI'1, communications director
for the society, because “there is
no central repository of
Pittsburgh history.”

The existing location on
Bigelow also lacked parking,
meeting space, adequate
restroom facilities and sufficient
research space.

_ THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, September 9, 1993

New programs planned for
the Pittsburgh Regional History
Center will include exhibit gal-
leries staffed by employees who
will wear period dress and
interact with visitors, offering
oral histories of Pittsburgh.
“Students and actors will be
hired to do research and create
their own roles,” Executive
Director John Herbst said.

The center will contain
expanded libraries, archives, a
500—seat auditorium, an ethnic
food court, as well as core and
rotating exhibits.

Among the exhibits planned
will be a logcabin, a 19505
ranch house, a trolley, an early
20th century diner and collec-
tions of artifacts of Pittsburgh
industries.

“Social history is the emphasis
here not just industrial history,”
Erwin said. The society has

acquired a three-story home in
Lawrenceville which was
owned by an immigrant work-
ing family of the early 20th cen-
tury.

“This will be an opportunity
for people to see how the work-
ers lived and give a different
perspective from the homes of
the Fricks or Hillmans,” Erwin
said.

The home will contain origi-
nal furnishings and documents
of the era that were acquired
from the owner’s daughter,
Gertrude Kins.

Kins is assisting the center by
providing an oral history.

Herbst said he feels that the
mission of the center is scl1olar—
ship first, but “there is a need to
present this in a way that is
enjoyable to everyone. Nobody
likes to just be talked to or read
to.”

Therefore, the museum will
emphasize a hands-on
approach where visitors can get
an up-close and personal View
of their heritage.

Pittsburgh architects Bohlin,
Cywinski, Jackson, Nolter and
Associates are doing the
design work on the History
Center as well as the Kins’
house.

The renovation of the old ice
company warehouse will keep
the four-foot-thick walls and
railway tracks running through
the building.

“They want us to be part of
their gang,” the children said.

But they were surprised to
learn that the military gets
involved with inner—city pro-
jects, according to Gruca.

“Short of police officers,
they’re ‘not used to seeing peo-
ple in uniform in a community
setting,” Gruca said.

It is important to Major Lauria
and fellow guards to portray an
image that counteracts the bad
examples so many adults set for
children today.

“Start changing things one‘
child at a time,” he said. “Get

that child on board, then have
him pass the baton to another
child.” .

Bob Gruca said he agrees
with Major Lauria. ‘‘'\What we
should be all about is building
good kids,” he said.

This “gang” becomes a real

asset to the city as well, which _

The residents in that area
have complained that the
wall, as it is, is too high and cre-

neighbors.

Site selection ,has been
pushed back several months

“We have looked at other

“But we are cutting new

the plan complete and inclusive
without becoming unwieldy.

Rouse said that part of the dif-
ficult and challenging process of
developing a master plan was
incorporating the needs of such
diverse constituencies as stu-
dents, residents, commercial
establishments, historic reviews
and the city itself.

“We have to figure out what
these needs will be in the near
and not so near future,” Rouse
said.

In other business:

there is a proposal from the
Faculty of Arts and Sciences to
expand the Clapp—Langley-
Crawford complex to add addi-
tional office and classroom
space as well as labs. This addi-
tion could be funded by a $6
million gift to the university.
Guzman cautioned that this was
only in the proposal stage at this
time.

-Guzman also reviewed the
physical changes to the campus
that took place this summer
including new ﬂower and tree

and renovations to the
Cathedral of Learning.

“Board proposed installation of

an outdoor clock atop a 16-foot
stand at the corner of Forbes
Avenue and Bigelow Boulevard
and a 30-foot gazebo near the
William Pitt Union was also dis-
cussed. .» K

Guzman reported to the com-
mittee that SGB President Jacob
Brody wanted identifiable
landmarks to enhance the carn-
pus.

“This way students can say
‘meet me under the clock,’ or
‘meet me at the gazebo,”
Guzman said.

Burstin

Continued from page 5
ments, Burstin says you’re -still an ideal student
for U.S. and the Holocaust, Black and Jewish
History or Jews in the U.S.

The requirements for passing her classes are
certainly unique.

For example, students in her Black and Jewish
History seminar were required last semester to
attend one of two extra—curricular activities. One
was a trip to a Sunday service at a black Baptist
church in the Hill District. The other was a
Passover seder at Temple Rodef Shalom.

Interviews are also a key factor in Burstin’s
classes. Students in her Spring 1993 Jews in the
U.S. class were required to meet and interview a
Jewish member of the Pittsburgh community and
write a term paper about the meeting. Black and
Jewish History students had a somewhat similar
experience but also had to interview an African-
American member of the community and _com-
pare and contrast both interviewees’ life experi-
ences.

“I think the interaction between the younger

and older generations is very valuable because it
gives each person a chance to really examine the
different values each age group possesses,” says
Burstin.

Perhaps the most important facet of each of
Burstin’s classes is the visitors. These aren’t the
visitors you experienced in high school, the
police officers who came to tell of the dangers of

_ drunk driving or the fire fighters that came to dis-

cuss fire safety. Burstin’s visitors are people you
pass on the street every day and don’t think

twice about, because they,don’t look any differ- ,

ent than the rest of us.

But they are.

Burstin’s visitors are Holocaust survivors.
They come to classes every semester and re-

lay their personal hells to a room full of
strangers. A 

Students have cried as they’ve listened to
Marga speak so calmly of the hatred that drove
her family from Poland.

They’ve wept with Jack as he recounts his jour-
ney through several death camps. They’ve clung
to Dora’s every word about her escape from
Hitler’s systematic extermination of her people,
and Fritz’s story of his trail on foot through sever-
al countries to reach freedom.

The goal of these visits, says Burstin, “is to
bring about a sensitivity to prejudice and anti-
Semitism in particular, racism in general and a
commitment to confront it.”

“The survivors were the greatest part of the
semester,” says Pitt graduate Lori Hyman. “My
Grandpa was a survivor, so I knew all about it
from him, but it’s a great way for people who
don’t know about it to get a better understanding
of what really, happened.”

Combating anti-Semitism and racism is a priori-
ty for Burstin.

As a board member of the Holocaust Center,
B’Nai Brith Hillel, the Urban League, the
American Jewish Committee, the Jewish Archives
and the Squirrel Hill Urban Coalition; and as a
former board member of the United Jewish
Federation, Burstin is a woman who gets things
done.

“I would love to see more priority on courses
and programs at Pitt that would make this school
a model for others across the nation,” says
Burstin. ,

“When I was in high school and college, they
didn’t teach us about the Holocaust. I would
have liked it if they did. I would like to see less
segregation and more cooperation among the
students.”

Come together

The planet Earth is really one big classroom.
Sure, universities such as Pitt can enlighten us in

numerous ways, but the true lessons in life are learned.

from our own experiences and the experiences of oth-

-€l'S.

In the Middle East, Israel, the Palestinians and neigh-
boring Arab countries have reached a crossroads never
believed possible a mere five years ago. Political rea-
sons aside, parties who have not been very willing to
even talk in the past are doing just that and more. An
end to the violence may be in sight.

Palestinian people are closer to being the master of
their -own house than they ever were under Israeli occu-
pation with proposed Palestinian self-"determination in

Gaza and the West Bank -town of Jericho. And Israel’s—.

Arab neighbors are realizing the Jewish state has the

right to exist. » E '
Although there are still many obstacles to be sur-

mounted, it is very important to point out the positive

. aspects of these new developments. America andtthe

international community should be applauding these
efforts for communication and reconciliation and sup-
porting them in any way possible.

The University of Pittsburgh can learn a great deal
from these encouraging strides.

In light of recent comments made by Black Action
Society Political Action Chair Oscar Eybers regarding
the position of bisexuals, gays and lesbians, as well as
Jewish students on campus, the time has come to step
aside and take a look from the periphery.

The University of Pittsburgh is fortunate to l1ave a very
diverse cultural landscape. But very often we talk at
each other and not to each other.

We have to be willing to listen. We all know that mis-
understanding and ignorance can lead to strife and

‘hatred. '

Just as important is the willingness to compromise.
The Israelis and Palestinians couldn’t have come as far
as they have without compromise. I

Cindy Goodman-Leib, associate director of B’nai B’rith
Hillel, extended an open invitation for dialogue to the
Black Action Society in response to Mr. Eybers’ state-
ments. Efforts need to be made to see that tolerance
wins out over intolerance. A

This attitude has been proven to work, even here at
Pitt. The Bisexual, Gay and Lesbian Alliance and the
Campus Women's Organization were in conﬂict over
the use of office space in the William Pitt Union this

' summer. Both groups realized that there is much more

to be gained by working togethertthan by being at
odds. A compromise was reached.

If we don’t open the doorsto better relations in the
future, no one will open them for us. We can all have

the ability to unlock the doors — willingness to listen,

understand and compromise.

China should host 2000 Olympics

With the selection of the site for the 2000
Olympics just weeks away, there has been a lot
of people in the U.S. that are opposed to Beijing
hosting the Games. One of the most vocal and
misinformed group has been Congress. The two
main reasons why some members of Congress
and other groups do not want to see Beijing host
the 2000 Olympics are “human rights” and arms
proliferation. ’

One has to question just how pure the U.S. has
been on these issues before it

travelling through many pairs of China, I firmly
support the Chinese governments’ population
policy. Quite frankly, China and the world in
general depend on its success.

Asia has almost 60 percent of the world’s popu-
lation, and it is time for that region to host the
Olympics again. Beijing has the facilities that it
used for the 1990 Asian Games, and the Chinese
people seem to want the world to see China as a
nation that has made progress in many areas. The

reluctance of some people to

can justly condemn another
nation. I don’t hear too many of
those same members of
Congress denouncing former
presidents Reagan and -Bush for
supplying Iraq with some of the

Tony

give Beijing the Olympics
because of its “annexation” of
Tibet and Xinjiang is a moot
point. They are as much a part
of the People’s Republic of.
China as Texas and Hawaii are 0

same weapons that enabled it to

fight Iran to a stalemate and invade Kuwait. It’s
funny how some people in the U.S. seem to col-
lectively forget some. of our own mistakes.

The second “big issue” that members of
Congress whine about is the Chinese population
policy. This policy rewards couples for agreeing
to have only one child and restricts all Han
Chinese (non—minorities) from having more than
one child. The government is not dragging preg-
nant women and forcing them to haveabortions.
Some fomis of coercion may be used, but it is the
exception. In the cities, families are monitored by
neighborhood committees, but in the countiyside
the policy is hard to enforce. How many of these
so—called experts in Congress have been to China
to check out the population situation for them-
selves. I’ve been to China three times and after

to the U.S. .

Abuse to human rights still exists in China t, but -
isolation is clearly not the way to solve the prob-
lem. The Chinese people are too proud to let the
self—righteous West bully them into following its
“New World Order” if the leadership fears that
those policies will cause internal problems.

China has*had one of the fastest growing
economies in the last decade and will be a major
economic power in Asia in the 21st century. As a
member of the nuclear club and the United
Nations Security Council,'it is simply impossible

 

‘to try and exclude China from the world in every

issue except the economy. If the U.S. tries to do
that, China can ‘surely count on Japan, Taiwan
and the European Community to fill our place.

on Sunday night. Both readings, held at the Carnegie, can be
purchased as a separate ticket.

' . The Ifinest Homemade Soups & Daily Specials I

  ITHE PITI‘ NEWS, Thursday, September 9, 1993

By Michelle Kleinsak
Staff Writer .

Director Claude Sautet’s Un Coeur en Hiver is a
depressing take’ on the rudimentary formula of
guy meets girl, introduces his best friend to girl
and an inevitable love triangle ensues.

For those of you who missed out on French
101, the title means “a heart in winter.” The heart
in question belongs to Stephane (Daniel -Auteuil),
a violin repairman who falls in love with the girl-
friend of his best friend Maxime (Andre
Dussollier), the owner of the repair shop. The
objet d’ attentione is Camille (Emmanuelle Béart),
a beautiful concert violinist.

The problem with this is that Maxime is a mat-
ried man when he meets Camille. He’s had
numerous affairs, and it takes some convincing
on his part to prove to Stephane that his fascina-
,‘ tion for Camille is not just another throw—away
 infatuation. This is hardly addressed in the begin-
 ning of the film.

 Are extramarital affairs so ordinary and com-
 monplace in modern French society that Sautet
5, overlooks it completely? Or is the fact that
 Maxime left his wife for her supposed to be pro
 of his undying love? V
I Sautet aims for the latter,,but in comparison

with Stephane’s motivations, it doesn’t seem to
wash.

Most of this story is utterly predictable, Sautet
doesn’t jazz up a hap-

to satiate all of the
Hallmark shop roman-
tics living in Holly-
wood. lnstead people
just move on with their lives much like real life.
Like I said before, depressing.

Sautet likes to pit images against each other and
see what happens. Stephaneas the unselfish
loner, living in a dark cave of a room in the violin
shop. Maxime as the extrovert who has it all. The
place he buys for Camille is bright, full of daylight
and open.

The empty, stark-white walls contrast with the
womb—1ike atmosphere of Stephane’s world.
Burying himself in work is a protective reac-
tionary mechanism where not feeling is better
than feeling and being burned.

Stephane’s ambivalence comes through in a
scene where everyone is gathered at a dining
room table discussing art. Someone says, “We live
in an era of pick-and—mix culture” where an apple
pie has as much artistic value as a Piero della

totem pole,” said Allison Hollihan, station manager.
Due to an increase in power at a station in Charleroi,
the FCC told WPTS that it had to relocate. The new
location is closer to other non-commercial radio sta-
tions like Carnegie Mellon’s WRCT 88.3 FM and inde-
pendent WYEP 91.3 FM. '

In order for the change to occur, someone has to
climb up the Cathedral of Learning tower and press a
few buttons. Around Oct. 4, the station will go off the
air for a few days while this is happening. When broad-
casting resumes, WPTS will comfortably be settling into
its new home at 92.1 FM.

In addition to the new location on the FM band,
WPTS would also like to start a new tradition by having
bands play live on‘ the air and more shows on campus
and in the surrounding area. Hollihan says, “One of our
main priorities is to bring in bands to play. This is partly
because of a lack of an all age club. Some of the bands
we’ll bring in. Some of them are in cooperation with
Manny [Theiner].” A

This will provide the chance mostlocal bands crave,
to be heard on the air playing raw to reach audiences
who can’t always get to the live shows. Several national
acts have wanted to play on the air, but due to a lack of
adequate facilities, nothing ever materialized.‘

Another item on the wish list is a CD that’s made up
of half local and half national "acts. Hollihan says, “A lot
of people ask’ about it, but because of the station

change it had to be pushed back. It’s a matter of having
the money up front, and CDs are really expensive to
print.” Expenses could run in the neighborhood of
$2,500.

Next up at ‘PTS is more diversity in music styles on
individual shows. The station already has more special-
ty programs than any other station in the area covering
everything from rap and house to metal. Hollihan says,
“A lot of students ask why we don’t play classic trax. It’s
because three other stations in Pittsburgh do, and
they’d probably listen to them anyway.” =

Everything that gets played on ‘PTS is the result of a
rotation system. All new releases that come in are
labelled heavy, medium or light. Hollihan says, “If we
get a rap record in and it’s heavy, it immediately gets
put in the heavy category.” » ‘

Every hour, spacesare slotted for four heavy cuts,
three medium and two lights cuts. There are also six
spots anihour where the DJ can play whatever he/she
wants.

You’re probably wandering how one becomes a D]
at ‘PTS. At the beginning of every semester, there are
interviews for people who want to work at‘ the station.
Interested parties are interviewed before undergoing a
training period. After the training period, the survivors
get their licenses. And remember, a license to DJ is a
privilege not a right.

Kiss
Kiss Alive 11]

. Mercury

vYou’re a Kissfan. Sure, they
laugh. Your band is exploita-
tive, corporate, derivative. The
lyrics have no socio-political rel-
evance.

There are no redeeming qual-
ities in this band. Kiss was big
during the ‘"705 dammit. You’re
in college, supposed to be

exploring your politically cor- -
_rect side.

Besides, country’s where it’s
at. P

But it’s mean out there. The
girl with the shaved head out-
side The Beehive wants you to
help her whine about bombing
warlords in Somalia. You’re

. looking at career opportunities
.at.Sunoco after graduation.
, “Shiny Happy People” won’t cut

it.

As far as the music world is
concerned, Kiss is dog food.
You never hear Kiss on the
radio.

Maketa request and they
laugh at you. Critics got bored
with Kiss bashing back when
Carter was president. Basically,
the media ignores Kiss, and you
like that.

Nothing trendy or fashionable
here. They can experience Billy
Ray Cyrus. You know what
works.

The new live album came out
last month. You were there the
day it went on sale. The guy on
the register sneers faintly while
taking apart the cassette holder.
No problem.

You’re wearing the shades,
the coat with the collar up. They
can’t know it’s you.

You get home and you’re in
your room. There’s a phone
call.-It’s your mom or some-
body.

Not now, you’re busy. Turn
the amp to 10 (loud or not at
all), pull out the Edie Brickell
dartboard and hit play.

into “Deuce.” It’s a song about a
a woman (read sex). Every Kiss
song is. “Ladies” Room,” “Lick it
Up,” “Room Service,” “Fits Like
a Glove,” “Rocket Ride.” It’s
basically 70-odd minutes of gui-
tars and sex.

If that bothers people like the
Beehive kids with shaved heads
or bleeding-heart college news-

paper types, it’s a shame ‘cause _

their opinion means a lot to
you.

Later, Simmons belts out
something about females bend-

are not impressed. Shucks. Pass

Francesca. While arguments fly
back and forth across the table
like atennjs’ ball on the disinte-
gration of distinctions between
high art and low art and the
separation of the classes,
Stephane just kicks back and
watches the game.

‘First of all, it’s hard to film a
dining room an debate without
coming off sounding really
highbrow and pretentious.

Although this particular attempt
doesn’t disappoint us, it does
represent a usually talked about
but never represented party.
Instead of having people sitting
around with a glass of burgundy
trashing the apathetic masses,
Stephane epitomizes the apa-
thetic masses. When questioned
about his resolute silence, he
says that the opinions presented

cancel each other out, so why ‘

bother having one?

Similarly, it’s hard to have a
strong opinion about this film,
especially since it’s so made for
television in its content and
approach. Un Coeur en Hiver is
entertaining but it is not a cine-
matic masterpiece, and it’s not a
healthy experience to see it if
you’re lonely or miserable.

Un Coeztr en Hiver begins its
run at the Pittsburgh Playhouse
in Oa/elana’ this Friday night.

And for your enjoyment,
Robin Guthrie managed to
obtain his own remix featuring
guess who? Could it be? Yes
folks, Elizabeth Fraser.
Regardless of the Cocteau
Twinesque version (which usu-
ally seems to find its way onto
every compilation), the song is
brilliant and just makes you
want to hold hands with the

person next to you. But there
are other songs, too.

Have you ever seen one of
those El Caminos that’s been
souped up with giant hot rod
wheels and has the big engine
sticking out of the hood? Well, if
you could do that to a song, it
just happened.

Pop Will Eat Itself revved up
Peter Gabriel’s “Games Without

Frontiers” with heavy—duty syn-
thesizer bleeps, voice effects
and some harsh guitar chords.
Not that the band did the song
too much injustice, I’m just
wondering what Pete thinks of
it all.

And seeing as it’s not the sea-
son for Christmas carols’ or the
like, I have no idea what My
Bloody Valentine was thinking
when it did “We Have All the
Time in the World.” With all due
respect, this one of my favorite
bands, but this song is just hell.
The vocals could easily be mis-
taken for Michael Jackson, and
the band’s trademark fuzzy gui-
tars got traded in for keyboard
scores‘ that Very well may be
right out of the Lawrence Welk
Show. But hey, it just goes to
show what people will do for
peace  or to get onto an
album.

The boys from Blur, on the
other hand, compensate for any
crap that crept onto this album
with their incredible cover of
Elvis Costello’s “Oliver’s Army”

my permission to be pompous,
but after hearing U2’s live,
acoustic performance of Lou
Reed’s “Satellite of Love,” Bono
has all my blessings. The man
brings divinity to this compila-
tion with an amazing falsetto
that sends the chills screaming
down even the hottest of
spines. And joining him for this
hair—raising duet is the leg-
endary velvet man himself. If
this doesn’t-make you cry, you
probably shouldn’t be listening
anyway.

So if you don’t buy this album

to catch Bono and Blur at their

best at least keep in mind that
all proﬁts generated will create
a trust fund for Northern
Ireland’s young people, and
you can buy it to help promote
peace.) '
‘ All these musicians came
together in the hopes of a bet-
ter, less violent future in the
British Isles, so why not help
out? The queen would be
proud.

—Karen Ocboa

The Mighty Mighty Bosstones
don ’t lenow bow to party
Mercury

Considering my previous
exposure to ska was limited to
an energetic local band (the
Skablins) and some old
Madness tapes, I eagerly antici-
pated this new adventure in lis-
tening pleasure. While The
Mighty Mighty Bosstones may
not know how to party, they do
know how to make party
music.

Lead singer Dicky Barrett’s
voice has all the range of David
Lee Roth’s, until he gets excited,
at which times he sounds like
the Cookie Monster on crystal
meth.

The band is paced by both a
funky bass line and horn sec-
tion as well as numerous instru-
mental ska breaks.

But the speed-metal guitar is
to blame for the incessant
pounding in your head that will
inspire you to run to the fridge
for another can of Milwaukee’s
Best.

"The songs are played tightly
and fairly consistently, and the
themes are evenly distributed
between straightforward dance
tunes (“Almost Anything Goes,”
“Our Only Weapon,” “Don’t
Know How To Party”) and the
requisite jabs at such pressing
problems as the hypocrisy of
war (“Tin Soldiers”), the impro-
prieties of police (“Illegal Left”)
and the repression of the reli-
gious right (“Holy Stroke”). But
you won’t be buying this album
for its startling insight; the lyrics
are really not the point. So turn
up your stereo, take off your
shirt, and strengthen your
friendships with your same-sex
peers by trying to knock them
on the floor with your ﬂailing
appendages.

(1991 ,9 'I3(iIII9I03C .vsba'1uti'l‘ .?.W5iVI l'l‘I<l .'>1H'l‘

THE PI'IT NEWS, Thursday, Sepiember 9, 1993

Columbia had half a mind,
they’d be marketing Gumball as
their version of Nirvana. Not
because the trio’s major label
debut provides the latest install-
ment of who-could—be—the—next-
band-to-burn—up-the-charts.

For one thing, Gumball has
Butch Vig (the bigshot responsi-
ble for making grunge palat-
able) producing and botching
up the proceeding in his vocals-
and-guitar-solos-are-the-only-
parts-of-the-song—that-matter
style. And it is probably the
greatest American rock—and-roll
band since the original Alice
Cooper group.

Guitarist Don Fleming wrote
some of underground rock’s
greatest and of course unheard
pop gems when he led D.C.’s
Velvet Monkeys in the early
‘80s.

When he movedto New York

later in the decade, he and ex-
Monkey drummer, Jay “The
Rummager” Spiegel, hooked up
with Shimmy Disc mogul
Kramer and formed B.A.L.L.
Together, they exchanged
Fleming’s pop roots for his ﬂare
for chaotic jamming. When the
band disintegrated, he and
Spiegel grabbed Pittsburgh resi-
dent Eric Vermillion and formed
Gumball. »

The songs on Super Tasty
bring together Fleming’s roots
in pop music, the kind that
ruled AM radio 20 years ago,
and his noisier tendencies.
“Accelerator,” with its obviously
overdone slide guitar, captures
the same sort of cruising care-
free attitude of his youth. And it
rocks. '

Like the aforementioned
Cooper band, the band plays
hard but writes songs with a

catchy and sometimes sensitive
bottom layer.

Fleming has the kind of voice
which sounds believable on the
fast songs but sensitive on the
slower cuts. His delivery on the
ballad-like “Marilyn” should
leave teenage girls swooning in
the aisles.

Can that Cobain chump say
that? '

As a whole, Super Tasty
might not break any new
ground, but it gives the same
old ground a new sheen. This is
loud rock and roll played with
spirit -—— a spirit that most major-
label bands don’t know where
to find. .

The only exception comes in
the last song, “Upsetters Theme
Song,” an embarrassing jam
with guitar masturbations from
Dinosaur Jr’s J. Mascis. Coming
at the end, though, the track

3
can be avoided easily.

But a listen to Super Tasty
begs a big question: after pro-
ducing notables such as
Teenage Fanclub and Sonic
Youth (okay, that was prepro-
duction), why didn’t Fleming
trust himself to produce the
album?

Butch Vig makes sure the
lyrics and guitars are audible,
but in doing so, he forgets
about the rest of the band.

As a result, the drums and
rhythm guitars lack a good deal
of kick.

Gumball probably sounds
mindblowing in concert. It
probably doesn’t spare any vol-
ume potential either. Super
Tasty indicates that to an extent,
yet it falls short because of its
lackluster, whitewashed pro-
duction.

Majors, Panthe

Johnny comes
marching home 
for first time
since 1976 0
regular season
Victory VS. WVU

Byjason Brame
Asst. Sports Editor

November 15, 1976.

A meaningless afternoon oth-
erwise, that Saturday in Pitt
football history — a 14-10 win
over archrival West Virginia —

, was the last time Johnny Majors

led a Pitt team into battle at Pitt
Stadium  n

 until Saturday night.

With 118 wins and ‘one
national championship, Majors

-, returns to the stadium where

he is in the midst of doing
again what made him a local
legend in the mid—’70s — resur-
recting the Pitt football pro-
gram. \

“This is a beautiful stadium
and there's a lot of tradition in
it,” Majors said. ' “And it’s
poignant and meaningful [to be
back], but I don’t really spend a
lot of time thinking about
Gordon Jones out there at wide
receiver or [former Heisman
Trophy winner Tony] Dorsett
running the ball.”

Any remaining thoughts of
the past washed away last
week as the Panthers made a
trip into stifling hot
Hattiesburg, Miss., coming
away with a nationally-tele-
vised. 14-10 victory over the
favored Southern Mississippi
Golden Eagles.

“I’ll be frank —— I was con-
cerned about winning a foot-
ball game this year,” Majors
said. “I don’t think [the-players]
really knew what to expect
from themselves or from their
coaches  but when we had

. our backs to the wall on a hot,

humid day, we kept fighting
back.”

‘‘I thought it was an impres-_

sive game,” Virginia Tech head

rs cautious

thought for them to go down
to Southern Miss and take it to
them down there was a heck of
a job. They improved as they

)7

went along -

 

Beamer said. “I mean no disre-
spect to Bowling Green, but

[Pitt is] stepping it up’ a level '

for sure.”

Like last Thursday, Pitt enters -

its home 0 ener short on man-

But Saturday’s game will be
much different than last week’s
— for both teams.

“There’s a big difference
between who we played last
week  Bowling Green  and
who we play this week  Pitt,”

power, as number-two tailback
Tim Colicchio and reserve
defensive tackle Eric Johnson
are questionable and most
probably out for the second
week in a row, both with
injured shoulders.

But unlike last week, now

the team -might not have the

full services of Dietrich Jells,
the offense’s only major quick-
strike threat, who sustained a

knee injury on Thursday night,

and was only upgraded to
probable late Wednesday.

Without Colicchio,' the
Panthers will once again turn to
tailback Curtis Martin to carry
the load offensively. The junior
racked up 68 yards rushing -
152 total — and two touch-
downs against the Eagles,
touching the ball every time on
the Panther’s first scoring drive
and 28 times in the game.
Despite the intense weather
conditions, Majors did not hesi-
tate to consistently give Martin
the ball.

“\Vhatever it takes to get the
game plan executed as proper-
ly as we can [will be donel,”
Majors said. “We’ll try, to get
the ball to our best people as
much as we can.” .

Jells’ absence will be more
difficult to contend with. Pitt
runs out Junior Green and
Curtis Anderson at split end,
but neither have the explosive-
ness or hands that jells pos-
sesses.

Pitt’s most devastating injury,
however, might be to starting
outside linebacker and Big East
Defensive Player of the Week,
Tom Tumulty, who spent three
days in the hospital nursing an
infected elbow. Tumulty was
released Wednesday afternoon
and attended practice, though
he did not run or exert himself.

“If anybody can make it
[back], he can make it,” Majors
said. “He’s a tough youngster
 but we won’t make him play
unless he’s ready. He meant a
lot to us the other night, and
he’ll mean a lot to us this year.

“But [if he doesn’t play], we
really don’t know who will start
there. We have no depth at
linebacker, whatsoever.”

John Ryan, who won the
starting job only days before
the opener, will get his second
start at quarterback. The red-
shirt sophomore was solid, if
not spectacular, against the
Eagles, throwing for 118 yards
and no interceptions despite
taking seven sacks.

“I was very pleased with
Ryan’s performance,” Majors
said. “His performance was
indicative of his practice  I
started him because he showed
more poise and more leader-
ship [than quarterbacks Pete
Gonzalez and Ken Fergusonl.”

With only one game and a
couple of scrimmages under
their collective belts, Majors
and his team have not had
much time to learn about one
another. -

But the head coach might
have found out more about his
team’s composure in that one

g game last week than through-

out all his preseason workouts.
For despite the predictions of
ESPN analyst Lee Corso, who
said that Pitt would turn the
ball over six times, this team
that is strikingly young — one
of the youngest in the country,
in fact went into an

Explosive offense?
Poor defense? v
Sounds like Pitt 
but it isn't. Meet /
the 1993 Hokies.

By Jack Becker
Staﬂ Writer

When the Pitt Panthers peer
out across Pitt Stadium in the
direction of the Virginia, Tech
Hokies Saturday night, they
might as well be looking into a
mirror.

Both teams had similar
records in 1992 (Pitt 3-9,
Virginia Tech 2-8-1), but the
resemblances go deeper than
that. The two teams racked up
big numbers on offense while
simultaneously surrendering an
even greater _‘amount on
defense _— a strategy that
doesn’t lead to manywins.

Virginia Tech averaged 380
yards total offense and 24.5
points per game, while getting
pounded for 405 yards and
25.6 points per game last year.
Sound anything like the
Panthers “92 season?

Similarities aside, the Hokies
view 1992 as a season’ of
missed opportunities and look
for big numbers in the single
most important category  the
win column. '

Virginia Tech held leads in
the fourth quarter in seven of
its .11 games last year —before
last-minute losses to the likes
of Rutgers, East ‘Carolina,
Louisville and Southern
Mississippi, as well as a last-
minute tie to North Carolina
State.

The Hokies are attempting to
climb out of the Big East base-
ment on the strength of the
improvement of individual
players.

“Our biggest strength right
now is quarterback Maurice
DeShazo,” Virginia Tech assis-
tant head coach Billy Hite said.
“He is such an improved play-
er. He took his lumps as a first-
year starter last year, but he’s

improved and he proved _it in

the opening ballgame [against
Bowling Greenl.”

DeShazo completed 16 of 21
for 214'yards and two touch-
downs last week against the
Green Wave. Last year he
threw for 1,504 yards and 12
touchdowns and ran for 206
yards and two more TDs.

The rest of the offense
should be more than capable
of joining Deshazo in tallying
the same type of numbers as
last year.

THE Pm NEWS, PREGAME, Thursda , Se tember 9, 1993.

l/irginid Tech mirrors

On the top of DeShazo’s
favorite target list this year will
be Antonio Freeman, who
caught ﬁve passes for 92 yards
and a touchdown against
Bowling Green.

In the backfield, Tech gradu-
ated star tailback Vaughn
Hebron to the Philadelphia
Eagles, which leaves the
Hokies with a very young
corps of runners. But the
group’s inexperience wasn’t
evident versus the Green
Wave. It churned out 256 yards
on the ground — led by
sophomore Dwayne Thomas
with 87 yards on 19 carries,
rookie Joe Swarm with 75

yards and the Tech version of
“Touchdown Tommy”
Edwards, who punched in two
one-yard TDs.

With three solid backs and a
fleet-of-foot quarterback at its
disposal, Virginia Tech is liable
to run the option — which is
exactly what it did eight times
against Bowling Green. .

“[The option] is something
we go to every now and then
to throw the defense off. It’s a
good weapon for us,”~i Hite
said. “I think it is one of the
best weapons in football per-
sonally.”

ball is less stable, but changes

The Hokies' pile-drivin' plowhorse

Center Jim Pyne has yet to give up_ a sack at Virginia Tech

By Stephen Flinn
Staff Writer

When the Panthers encounter
Virginia Tech in this season’s
home opener, Pitt’s defensive
lumberjacks will be trying to
chop down an obstacle the size
of a redwood tree when it
faces the Hokie offensive forest
led by six—foot-two-inch, 280-
pound senior center Jim Pyne

(pronounced pine).

“Their center is an All-
American candidate and is
rather large. It seems every-
body these days has especially
large centers, especially on the
teams we play,” Pitt head
coach Johnny Majors said.

Pyne holds the weightlifting
record at Virginia Tech for a
hang/clean of 401 pounds and
routinely bench presses 440

pounds while also setting a
team—high 650 pounds in the
backsquat. His pacing and out-
standing work ethic in the
weight room have earned him
the title of “Super Iron Hokie”
for the last two years. '

Pyne, originally from Milford, ,

Mass., has been evaluated by
nine preseason college football
magazines - including The
Sporting News and Football
Digest —— as being the best
center in college football. His
head coach agrees with this
notion wholeheartedly.

“When talking offensively
[about Va Tech], the first thing
that comes to mind is our cen-
ter Jimmy Pyne,” Hokie head
coach Frank Beamer said. “I

i feel he is the best center in the

country. He has started as a
freshman and has started 29 of
the 50 games in which he has
played for us since then, and
he has never been attributed
with allowing his quarterback
to be sacked.”

‘ Pyne attributes his stamina to
part hustle and part luck.

“I try to always keep my feet
moving, because when you just
stand around during or after a
play, that's when you get hit. I
have also been lucky to never
suffer a serious injury,” Pyne
said.

The incredible statistic of
never allowing a sack is also
something Pyne attributes to
both skill and luck.

“I think strength, speed, tech-
nique and knowledge of the
game has all helped me in
doing my job, and I have just
been lucky that its worked out

Fresh from a

steady outing vs.

Southern Miss,
QB John Ryan
looks to solidify
status as starter

By Cory Walborn
Staff Writer

John Ryan wasn’t going to
lie.

He was nervous before the
Southern Mississippi game and
he wasn’t afraid to say it.

But heck, he had time.

Going through all the
pregame drills and watching
the Pitt defense take the field
first, the sophomore quarter-
back had ample time to quiet
the butterflies inside his stom-
ach.

But Panther defensive end
Zatiti Moody Changed all that.

Stripping the ball free and
recovering a Southern
Mississippi fumble on the
game‘s second play, Moody
forced No. 14 to trot onto the
field earlier than expected.

Good thing. Ryan, getting
ready to take his first snap of
his first collegiate start, was
now, believe it or not, no
longer nervous.

“Getting in real quick, I
didn’t have time to be ner-
vous,” Ryan said.

And it showed. ,

touchdown and a 7-0 lead,
Ryan did, as hewould the rest
of the game, what had to be
done. The lanky six—foot-three-
inch signal—caller was _not flashy

-and did not put up great num-

bers —— he just held onto the
ball and won. A
And the game plan helped,

“If we could stick with that

win," Ryan said, “well keep

doing it.

“It was nice going into the
game’, knowing the idea of the
game plan,” Ryan added.

The game plan, to Ryan, was
to get the ball into tailback
Curtis Martins hands and hope
for the best. The  Martin
ran, the best occurred.

Using a short swing pass to
Martin over and over again, Pitt
continually gained yardage and
scored its second touchdown

“I was wondering what

Ryan said. “They just couldn’t
adjust to Curtis.

“In the past we tried to bal-

Ryan said. “But this year we

zines.

“They’re probably the most
talented team in the league 
definitely the most solid,” Pitt
head coach Joe Luxbacher said.
“They’re just so all-around 
everybody on that team works
hard, plus they have three or
four guys who are just a level
above everyone else in the
league.”

At the top of that group is
junior forward Huey Ferguson
who is from Kingston, Jamaica.
In his sophomore campaign
last year, Ferguson led the Big
East in scoring with 23 points
in conference games (47 points
overall), giving him 67 points
(22 goals, 19 assists) over his
two—year collegiate career. His
efforts earned him All-American
honors, as well as Big East
offensive player of the year.

Ferguson will lead a St.

. _john’s offensive attack that net-

ted aleague-high 26 goals in
eight Big East games last year.

Oddly enough, however, the
potent Redmen offensive unit is
not half as frightening as its
suffocating defense led by the
Big East’s top goaltender, john
Urbom. Last season, Big East
opponents managed a grand
total of four goals in eight
games against the Redmen’s
superb netminder.

In the final game of the 1992
regular season, the Redmen did
what no other Big East team
had been able to do through-‘
out the campaign — complete-
ly dominate the Panthers. Led
by first half goals from
Ferguson, Joe Navarino and
Robert DeLuca, the Redmen
humbled Pitt with a decisive 4-
1 thrashing.

That resounding victory put
the final touches on a perfect
8-0 regular season for the
Redmen.

However, St. John’s head
coach Dave Masur is the first
one to point out that the
atmosphere surrounding that
game was hardly one of wall-
to—wall intensity.

“I don’t lend too much to
that victory, because the game
really didn’t matter,” Masur
said. “Pitt already had a playoff
spot wrapped up  everyone
knew exactly where they stood,
so that game was pretty much
just to put the finishing touches

on the [reg'ularl season.”

After opening this season
with a disappointing 3-0
shutout loss to Bucknell, the
Panthers will have to pick up
their overall intensity several
notches in preparation for. the
Redmen.

“In order to beat [St. John’sl,
we are going to have to rise
above the level of play that we
showed against Bucknell,”
Luxbacher said. “We can’t let
them score a lot of goals early.
Against Bucknell, we got down

-2-0 in the first half, and we

couldn’t come back.

“We are not going to win
games [by scoresofl 4-5 or 5-4.
We need to shut them down,
and we didn’t do that [against
Bucknelll.”

extremely tough climate and
didn’t turn the ball over once.

“It could have been a thing
that just happened that night,
but over a period of time it
takes discipline and athleticism
in times of pressure [to perform
at that level],” Majors said. “But
I’m not going to try to talk
them into anything different 
[we will try to] build on the
positive.”

Nevertheless, despite the
Herculean efforts of his team,
Majors knows that football on
that level will not carry it
through the season.

“There were a lot of tremen-
dous areas  effort, attitude,
hustle, and we looked decently
organized,” he said. “But we
made "a lot of mistakes and
there’s a lot of room for
improvement. We looked pret-
ty ragged at times in our execu-
tion, but the effort was there.

“It’s. tough to tell how teams
will react [to victory], and it’s
challenging to stay hungry
every minute. It’s a challenge
every game.”

Pyne

Continued from page P-4
this way,” Pyne said.

Pyne’s athletic skills were
evident early as he was recruit-
ed by too many schools to
mention, but the most notable
schools being’: Stanford,
Michigan, Michigan State, Iowa
and Penn State. He chose
Virginia Tech not just because
of the school, but also because
of the people.

“I really liked all the people
at Virginia Tech, all the coaches
and the players. Virginia Tech
is just a great school all-around.
It was a tough decision at that
time, but a decision I am now
glad I made,” Pyne said.

Pyne’s study habits are also
evident, as he was honored on
the Entertainment and Sports
Programming ‘ Network’s
Scholastic America. He is cur-
rently a marketing major.

Though he has excelled in
the classroom, Pyne’s immedi-

ate calling is most definitely the

National Football League —
barring any majordisaster with
his health. And Virginia Tech
entering the Big East will give
Pyne more exposure when NFL
Draft day rolls. around next
yeah

“It definitely helps. I think
the Big East is a fine confer-
ence with a lot of good
schools,” Pyne said.

Another attribute that will.

boost Pyne’s stock on NFL’s
Wall Street is his assigned extra
duty to the long-snapping
chores. _ _ _

“I always long snapped in
high school, and I was the
backup long snapper here all
along, so this isn’t new to me.
It can only help when trying to
get picked by an NFL team,” he
said. ,

There is no doubt that Pyne
will see action in the NFL upon
graduating, which will make
him the first third-generation
person to play professional
football. His father, George
Pyne, III, played for the Boston
Patriots, and his grandfather,
George Pyne, Jr., played for the
Providence Steamrollers, who
later became the Chicago
Bears.

If the scouts listen to his

head coach, Pyne should be
picked relatively high in next
s'eason’s draft. ’ —

“]im’s the best I’ve ever seen.
He's tenacious. He goes after
the man and stays after him
until he blocks him,” Beamer

said.

The Panther defense will lit-
erally have its work cutout for
itself this Saturday, as it

‘attempts to face the‘ onslaught
of Jim Pyne, this Paul Bunyon
among offensive lineman.
