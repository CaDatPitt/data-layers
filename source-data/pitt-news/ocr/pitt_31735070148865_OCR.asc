New details emerge about Krangle’s emails

Byjosh Won
Staﬁ" Writer

New details from the criminal com-
plaint against Mark Lee Krangle
show he was arrested after sending
threatening emails to Pitt profes-
sors. .

Pitt police arrested Krangle
on one charge of harassment by
communication and one charge of

terroristic threats on Wednesday '

afternoon at the Pittsburgh Inter-
national Airport. ‘
According to the criminal com-
plaint, Krangle, a 65-year-old resi-
dent of Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y.,

sent three emails to current ‘and
retired ‘Pitt professors, threatening
them and claiming that the recent

bomb threats are being orches-

trated to further his cause, as out-
lined in his book, “Revolution or
Extinction.” ' -

“If you guys do not show me
supportiveness in every possible
way that your meager little aca-
demic fantasy world lives can mus-
ter, your graves will be deﬁled by
enraged citizens in the future after
you die (I hope natural deaths),”
Krangle said in an email to current
and retired professors Thomas
Kane, Donald Egolf, Jack Daniel
and Attilio Favorini.

Pitt spokesmanjohn Fedele said
on Wednesday that he was not able
to say whether Krangle’s arrest was
related to the "bomb threats that
Pitt received this semester. Since

- Krangle’s arrest, the University has

received 12 more threats, bringing
the sernester’s total to 79.

According to the complaint,
Krangle’s ﬁrst email said he was
planning to come to Pittsburgh
“for as long as it takes to get his
story covered by the local and na-
tional press.”

Since April 3, Krangle began
regularly posting public Face-
book comments about the bomb
threats.

“I swear someone told me they
were going to orchestrate this ex-
act series of threats some time ago
in order to help me to tell my story
about an America that none of you
should be proud of,” he posted on
April 6. ,

The criminal complaint states
that Krangle’s secondemail ref-
erenced the shooting at Western
Psychiatric Institute.

“Don’t try to do anything that
may involve Western Psych when I
get to town. I am not violent or cra-
zy, and that’s why Shick was put into
play. Things would get much worse
if you try to derail me. Support me
or perish,” the email said. I ‘

George Gray took a deep breath
before putting both feet on the ped-

_a1s of a unicycle outside the main

entrance of the William Pitt Union
Thursday afternoon. He lurched
forward, then teetered back and
forth before falling, laughing as
several others watched.

“It’s harder than it looks,” the
sophomore said afterward, adding
that he had already tried it about
10 times.

Gray, a member of Pi Kappa Phi.
fraternity, _was taking the Unicycle
Challenge as part of the event Pedal
for Push, a 50-hour bike—a-thon
hosted by the Pitt chapter of Pi Kap-
pa Phi fraternity. Proceeds from the
event will beneﬁt Push America, a
national organization that raises
awareness for disabilities.

As of 2 p.m. Thursday, the
second annual bike—a-thon had
raised about $300 after only two
hours, bringing the total funds
raised by the fraternity this year
to $8,600. '.

Sophomore Tim Daly, the chap-
ter’s philanthropy chair, organized
the event. He was optimistic that by
the end of the bike—a-thon at 2 p.m.
Saturday, the chapter will reach its
goal of $10,000 for the year.

Daly explained that Push Ameri-
ca, which the national organization
of Pi Kappa Phi owns and operates,
donates money to a variety of lo-
cal organizations that assists those
with disabilities. Additionally, 25
percent of the money that the
chapter raises goes toward local
organizations.

Last year the chapter organized
a much smaller bike—a-thon with
only three bikes rather than this
year’s ﬁve. Daly said the event
raised $1,200, $300 of which the
fraternity donated to United Ce-
rebral Palsy.

Though Pi Kappa Phi is hosting
the event, Daly said that all stu-
dents are welcome to participate
by donating money and riding the
stationary bicycles in half-hour
shifts. In addition to the fraternity’s
76 members, the event’s organiz-

ers invited members of sororities
to participate and advertised the
event on campus beforehand.

“I - wanted this to grow into
something that the whole campus
can get into,” Daly said. “This is by
no means something that’s strictly
Greek life or strictly P_KP.”

Freshman Mark Dai, a member»

of the fraternity, said many students’
who learned about the event while
the chapter was tabling .over the
last few weeks signed up to partici-
pate. In spite of the often subdued
mood around campus after persis-
tent bomb threats, those passing by
enjoyed the chance to stop and see
what was happening.

I “There is a lot of general mirth,”
Dai said. “People will come up and
try the unicycle.”

Daly said that with the height-
ened security measures and smaller
crowds around campus, it was still
important to hold Pedal for Push
and other events at the Univer-
sity. .

“We felt that it would be a good
way for campus to rally,” he said.

University mum on  
  finals, graduation plans

The Pitt News Staff

With the number of bomb threats

ever increasing and ﬁnals week

and graduation fast approaching,
the University has not said what
its plans are if the bomb threats
continue.

Pitt spokesmanjohn Fedele said
he was unable to comment on the
University’s plans for ﬁnals.

“It is too soon to say,” he said.
“We will have more information
down the road.”

Fedele said that the rumor cir-
culating about a mandatory policy

requiring all professors to provide
take-home exams to students ifthe
bomb threats continue is not true.

When addressing changes to
ﬁnals policies, Fedele alluded to
Chancellor Mark Nordenberg’s
April 6 statement to faculty and

' students.

“All professors are being asked
to do their best to assist their stu-
dentsin meeting their academic
responsibilities,” Fedele said. _

For spring graduation, which
is set to take place at the Petersen
Events Center on April 29, Fedele
said that is “too early to discuss
contingency plans for gradua-
tion.” ..

Freshman Myah Cummings had
just turned off the shower when
the alarms in Litchﬁeld Towers
went offat 10:11 p.m. on April 5,
forcing her and two friendsto seek
shelter in the Hillman Library.

It was the second of ﬁve evacua-
tions Towers residents would face
this semester. 1

“At least it wasn’t at 4 in the
morning,” Cummings said. Two
days before, Cummings and more
than 1,800 other Towers residents
were forced to evacuate the dorm
at 4 a.m. and could not return to
their rooms for more than two
hours.

The alarms on April 5 marked

the 24th bomb threat of the se-

mester. Since then, the number
has risen to 80. ,

Many of the threats have tar-
geted residence halls and Univer-
sity-owned apartments, forcing
residents to grab what they can
and ﬁnd a place to stay until their
buildings are cleared. This often
takes hours, depending on the
number of other buildings that

simultaneously receive threats. .
The abundance ofthreats has
created a sense of unease and
anxiety among Pitt students. On
top of the regular stresses caused
by classes and upcoming ﬁnals,
students now have to ﬁgure out an
alternate sleeping plan in the case
of an evacuation. And recently, stu-
dents have turned to the Internet
to look for places to stay. p .
Before going to bed, many resi-
dents pack extra clothes and food
into their backpacks so they can
leave quickly if the need arises. '
Other Pitt students have used
social networking sites to ﬁnd a
place to sleep. Students and others

in the Pitt community joined to-

gether to create Facebook groups
and _Google documents that pro-
vide contact information for dis-
placed residents who need a bed
and some food.

A Google document titled .“Pitt
Couch Surﬁng” has recently sur-
faced, listing more than 100 tem-

porary living options for students.

living on campus.

The document lists volunteers’
names, apartment and dormitory
addresses, living features, distance
from campus, contact information

“At least it wasn’t four in the
morning.”

and the number of evacuees each
residence can ﬁt. Some volunteers
offer extra information, letting
students know if volunteers have

pets or if there are any rules or '

requirements. Many require that
students seeking shelter carry
their Pitt ID.

Pitt alumnus Gregory Barto-
lomei is offering his apartment on
Cable Place to anyone affected by
the bomb threats.

“It’s a bad situation for every-
one, and having the security of
where you stay your nights threat-
ened is a bad thing, and we want
to do what we can do,” Bartolomei

' said.

Bartolomei has not had to host
any evacuees yet but said he under-
stands the anxiety of those living
on campus.

“The only reason I’m not wor-
ried is because I live off campus
and don’t have to worry about be-
ing evacuated in the middle of the
night,” he said.

Pitt’s crew team uses a Face-
book group to give students a place
to stay. -

Julie Hallinan, a junior with an

‘ off-campus apartment on upper

campus, hosted girls from her
rowing team last week.

“I left them my house keys be-
cause I went home for Easter, and

Students teat with emotionattvtt vtreveatettomt threats  

they stayed there on the weekend,”
she said. “I know a lot of our fresh-
man boys have been staying with
other boys on the team.”

The crew team’s executive
board decided to create a Face-
book group and send emails list-
ing addresses and numbers to the
entire team because they were
concerned for the safety of team
members.

“Crew is like my family here at
school, and it was really inspiring
and great to see the solidarity of
my team because we’re very com-
petitive on the water, but we take

care of each other off the water,” :

Hallinan said.

Sarah Halperin, a sophomore
who experienced of evacuation
when Amos Hall received a bomb
threat on April 9, also put her con-
tact information on “Pitt Couch
Surﬁng” because she wanted to
open her suite to evacuated stu-
dents.

“I was sitting there in Towers
Lobby and didn’t know where I
was going, and I was tired,” said
Halperin, who has not yet had
any evacuees stay at her place.
“I don’t want anyone else to feel
that way.” I

Opinidnizing often amounts to
nothing more than making ex— -
traordinary elaims about ordinary
events or objects. An opinion mak-

' er, professional or private, can take

February’s Obamacare birth con-
trol ﬁasco and turn it into either a
polemic about supreme religious
persecution or supreme sexist
bigotry. Maybe both positions are
exaggerated,‘ but they’re at least
supposed to make us think.

But who wants to hear more
about Obamacare? A much more
interesting topic for semi-reckless
opinionizing is America’s favorite
handheld pastime, Angry Birds.
To make things more interesting,
we can usepthe game’s older sister,
Tetris, as a foil. .

A great deal of literature has

 

already been written about Tetris’

‘appeal to a generation of players.

For its creator, Russian computer
scientist Alexey Pajitnov, Tetris
isn’t just a game, but a creative
endeavor that allows users to “take
the chaos of the -pieces falling down
in random and put them together
in some kind of ordered way.”
Other analyses of the game
are more eccentric: British mu-

sical comedy band Pig With The

Face Of A Boy took Tetris’~ theme
song and using the refrain “I am
the man who arranges the blocks,”
explained how the player repre-
sents the Russian people, buffeted
carelessly back and forth by the
winds of history through czardom,
communism and eventually faux-
capitalism. A popular CollegeHu-
mor video uses the.Tetris experi-
ence as a lesson in cruel fate, with a
heartless god hurling down pieces
we don’t need when all we want is

the human condition

the long one to score a Tetris.
But I think one of the most
negative interpretations has more

resonance: Georgia Tech professor ‘

Janet Murray theorizes that Tetris
is the “perfect enactment of the
overtasked lives of Americans.”
The game, she says, embodies the
idea that life feels like nothing
more than a to-do list we have to
keep clearing, just to make room
for more things.

But if Tetris represented yes-
terday, what can we learn about
ourselves from Angry Birds?

For one thing, we don’t live in
the work—oriented world of Tetris
anymore. Florida State University
researchers surveyed 1,100 full-
time workers in 2010 and found
that the recession has pushed
many into thinking more deeply
‘about the nature and value of their

Letters to the editor

To the Editor,

I am writing in response to the two letters that were in The Pitt News yesterday written
by Daniel Glazier and Brian Phillips. First, I would like to start by stating how Brian could
not be anymore wrong! Bomb threats are one of the few times to actually use the ENS alerts.
Everyone connected to the University needs to be aware of a potential threat so they can
avoid the area. It would be a safety hazard to have students and faculty go toward a building
with the possibility of having a bomb in it. Second, I would like to say to Daniel that the
University ofﬁcials have to make thedecisions, because that is THEIR job. The last thing
I want is for SGB to get involved with anything dealing with my safety. Can we remember
how long it took them to “handle” the Collegiate Readership Program?? Students would
only slow the decision-making process, which puts everyone at risk. I have the utmost
conﬁdence that our administration is handling the situation to the best of its abilities, and
I respect the efforts of the school and law enforcement in keeping the campus safe.

To the Editor,

I am writing in response to Mark Kozlowski’s article “Pitt’s Transgender Policy N eces—
sary.” While I disagree with many of the points Mr. Kozlowski attempts to make, I wish to
speciﬁcally express my disgust at his proposal for how resident assistants should handle
situations involving transgender residents. '

As an RA, I was shocked at the author’s proposed solution that “RAs informally make
sure that transgender students use the bathrooms of the genders with which they identify,”
despite the existence of a University policy that forbids it. Asking an RA to foster tolerance
and ﬂoor community is one thing, but suggesting that we should blatantly violate policy
is another. Violating policy puts an RA’s job in danger, a ﬁnancial risk that many RAs can-
not afford to take. Additionally, having such an “informal” policy means it would not be
consistently enforced, as different RAs would undoubtedly have different approaches to
this issue. Furthermore, this would put RAs in a position to discuss gender identity, a very
personal and sensitive issue, with residents who may not feel comfortable addressing such
a topic with their RA. 0

Solutions to this issue need to be more thought—out and policy—oriented than Mr.
Kozlowski presented. As an RA and ally of the LGBT community, I would certainly do
everything in my power (as all RAs should) to maintain a transgender resident’s right to a
safe and comfortable living space. However, asking students to risk their jobs for a tactic
that would likely fail is a deplorable idea. '

up room for more work. ‘

The shift from Tetris to Angry Birds isn’t

More and more, craziness seems to emerge
from nowhere. A

9/11, the 2008 Financial Crisis, Hurricane

ranging from personal hardship and de-
spair to broad chaos. While -in retrospect,
we might have been able to see some of the
problems coming (time will tell with the
shooting and bomb threats), there was no
probable way these things could have been
stopped.’ . .
For this world, Angry Birds is again the

better Tetris players and exercised more
foresight — keeping a space open for the
squiggly tetromino — the events listed

_e above still would have happened. In An-
gry Birds, there’s no predictability; life is-

just a series of birds being hurled at fragile
structures, and sometimes one comes out
of nowhere, taking down everything. Of
course, we can guess and plan and study
the past, but every once in a while that bird

comes shrieking in from the left, unleashing
unexpected damage.

So the next time you pick Angry Birds
over Tetris, remember that you might ac-
tually be picking chaos and spontaneous
disorder over a more controlled model of
the universe.

17, 5—6’Big East) used the offen-
sive explosion to extend their
winning streak in conference
play to ﬁve games by winning
both contests of a doubleheader
against Georgetown (15-25, 0-8
Big East) at the Petersen Sports
Complex.

Freshman pitcher Alexa Lar-
kin said that Pitt’s disappoint-
ing 0-6 start in Big East play
served as a rude awakening for
the team. '

“We got a big wakeup call and
realized we had to get it togeth-

er,” Larkin said in an interview;

“We know we have the talent
and that we’re a good team, it

was just a matter of stringing
everything together, and we’re
doing that now.”

Pitt 2, Georgetown 1.

In the first game, Pitt fresh-.
man pitcher Savannah_'King con-
cededjust one run on three hits
as she tied the school record for
wins in a season with 16.

Georgetown took the lead in
the third inning, but the Pan-
thers offense immediately re-
sponded. ‘ *

Senior Ciera Damon and‘
freshman Maggie Sevilla each
singled before Kelly Hmiel
brought both base runners home
with a two-run double that gave
Pitt the lead for good.

After the game, King said
that despite falling behind, the
Panthers remained confident
that they would earn the vic-
tory.

“We worked hard to pull that-

ﬁrst game out,” she said. “Kelly

did. a great job to get those two

runs batted in. We knew we

would come back and we did.”_
Pitt 11,_Georgetown 0

After winning the tight af-

, fair in game one of the double-

header, the Panthers made sure
that the result in game two was
never in doubt.

Leading off the second in-
ning, senior Kristen Cheese-

brew opened the scoring with

her fifth home run of the sea-
son. _-
But the Pitt offense was just
getting started.

Freshman Carissa Throck-
morton made it back—to—back
long balls with her fourth home

run and, following a walk, fellow -

freshman Carly Thea drilled her

first career home run to give Pitt

a 4-0 lead.

Panthers pick up two”  
out-of-conference wins  

By,Dustin Gabler
Staff Writer

The Pitt baseball team picked up
two wins this week over teams that
defeated the Panthers earlier this
season.

Pitt senior Anthony DeFabio
said the nonconferencewins over

' Akron and Penn State will help the
A team build momentum for a week-

end series against the Big East’s

ﬁrst—place team, South Florida. -
“We beat two quality teams this

week, which is great, especially

‘ coming off a sweep this past week-

end,” DeFabio said.
The two out-

game and picked up the win in 5.1
-innings of work. He _allowed two
runs on six hits while striking out
eight batters. ,

, The Pitt offense took advantage
of four walks and one timely single
by Roche that drove in Boo Vazquez
and DeFabio for two runs.

With two outs in the third in-
ning, three walks and a hit by
pitch brought home a third run
for Pitt. ‘ l _

Both squads plated two runs in
the sixth inning, and Leonardi was
removed from the game following
a troubling inning. Dave Yakopec
took Leonardi’s place for the Pan-
thers and ﬁnished the game.

Pitt’s season comeslto an
end at NCAA regional meet

By Dexter Gulick
Staff Writer

‘The Pitt gymnastics team sent three ath-
letes‘ to the NCAA regional meet, but the
Panthers’ season came to an end‘ when
none of the gymnasts qualified for the
NCAA national meet.

Six fullteams —- University of Florida,
Ohio State, North Carolina State, Penn
State, University of North Carolina, Kent
State — were selected to attend the re-

gional meet in Raleigh, N.C. Pitt had one «
all-around gymnast and two specialists

selected to attend the meet.

Pitt’s all-around selection, Haley
Bodenheimer, finished 17thAout of 17 gym-
nasts in the all-around competition. The
placement stemmed from an uncharacter-
istic fall in the floor exercises, in which
she scoredjust 9.100.

“After I fell on the ﬂoor, I was a little
upset because that typically doesn’t hap-
pen,” Bodenheimer said. “But I came back

strong on the vault and ﬁnished up with _

a good meet on bars and beam to top off
my freshman year at,regionals.”

The Winston—Salem, N.C., native ﬁn-
ished solidly in her other three events,
rackingup 9.825in the vault to tie for 16th
out of 42. She rounded out the night with
a 9.750 in the uneven bars and a 9.700 in
the balance beam, earning 27th and 26th
out of 42, respectively. _ '

Head coach Debbie Yohman said that
it’s hard for individual gymnasts to go to
a meet and compete without their team
present.

“Haley unfortunately started on floor
and had a fall on her last pass,” Yohman
said. “She was doing one of her better
floor routines of the year. But the -floor
was very bouncy, so I think both her and
_Katie O’Rourke put on the brakes a little
bit to clean up a little bit. I think she just
put on thebrakes a little too much.” A_ _

“But she proceeded to get back and do
an excellent job on the next three events.
She had probably the best vault of her
season.” '

In the individual competition‘; sopho-
more O’Rourke took 31st out of 42 in the

ﬂoor exercises with a 9.700. Alicia Talucci,"

competing in her last meet as a'Panther,
took 31st out of 42 in the vault with a
score of 9.775.

“The vault that I did was alot bigger,
which was what we were working on,” '

Talucci said. “I didn’t stick it —— I took a
small step, but that’s what happens when
you work on something new. But I am
really happy with how I went out. It’s bit-
tersweet because it’s my last meet, but it
was a fun meet and there wasn’t a lot of
pressure. I had a good time, and I’m glad
that I ended on a good note.”

No. 1 Florida won the meet and Ohio
State came in second, sending the two
teams to the. National Championships

from April 20-22 in Duluth, Ga.

The top two all-around contestants
not on the top two teams at regionals will

go to Georgia to compete as individuals. ‘

No individual event competitors, such
as O’Rourke and Talucci, go to the meet
unless they-win their events. ﬂ

Sam Parcnte and the Pitt baseball team beat Akron and Penn State this week.

Alex Caravella, usually a bullpen arm for
Jordano, got the start for Pitt and effectively
cooled off a Penn State team in the midst of
a six—game winning streak.

Penn State started the scoring in the top

. of the second with two runs on one hit and

an error by the Pitt defense.

The Pitt offense knotted the game up at
two in the bottom half of the frame when Ste-
phen Vranka and Oswald b'oth connected for

hits that scored ‘Mike Douglas and Vranka, g

respectively. _ _
The Panthers scored two more runs in
the ﬁfth when Soto singled to right ﬁeld,

Senior Staff ’l1otograpl1er

scoring DeFabio and Oswald.
Penn State got one run back in the sixth
inning to narrow the deﬁcit to one.
Caravella was pulled following six innings
of work. He allowed just one earned run
and two hits. .
Luke,Novosel andjoe Harvey combined

to throw three scoreless innings as the Pan- A

thers hung on for the lead.

Pitt added an insurance run in the sev-
enth inning when DeFabio singled in Derik
Wilson. ‘V ' . '

_ “I was very pleased with today’s perfor-

— mance. I think we gave them a few too many
opportunities early in the ballgame,'but we
rebounded extremely well,”Jordano said. “It

I some big hits and some big pitches. Overall

run of them all. Her towering shot hit the
press box of the adjacent soccer stadium
at the Petersen Sports Complex and in-
creased the Panthers’ lead to six runs.

“Hitting is contagious,” Hmiel said of
the rare four—home run inning. “When
you see everyone getting hits, you know
everything is coming together.”

Pitt followed up the second inning by
adding four runs in the third and one
more in the fourth as head coach Holly
Apri1e’s team built an insurmountable
lead.

That was more than enough run
support for Larkin, who recorded her
sixth victory of the season and nar-
rowly missed throwing a no—hitter.
The Hoyas tallied their only hit with

two outs in the final inning to spoil Lar-
kin’s no—hit bid.

“I wish I could’ve made one more
pitch to get that last out, but I’m still
happy with the win,” Larkin said after
the game. “Our team had so much en-

Entering the showdown riding a five-

“We’re definitely excited to take 023:

Hmiel said the Panthers need to fol-

continue their winning streak.

“The defense and pitching is there,
and we need to stay focused on hitting
by taking things once pitch at a time and
