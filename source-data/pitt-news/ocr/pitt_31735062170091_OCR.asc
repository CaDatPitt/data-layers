Students can influence and in-
novate change at the University
according to Jerry Schneewind,
Dean of the Arts and Sciences Col-
lege. He told an informal group of
about 15 student leaders that
pressure for experimentation must
come from the undergraduates be-

the impetus.

“The student must voice his
opinion or changes will be made
that he does not want,” asserted
Schneewind who prefers not to be
called Doctor (“That’s for medi-
cal people. )

SCHNEEWIND HOPES to open
the lines of communication be-
tween his office and the student
body. Anyone dissatisfied with a
particular course or instructor
should meet withthe dean.

Scott Baum, SG president, men-
tioned a general ingrained fear of
faculty and administrators that
students have which prevents
them from communicating their
thou hts 4

 

cause the faculty will not provide 1

 

Schneewind emphasized that the
students must become more ac-
tive participants in affecting
change. He cited the fact that the
power structures for curriculum
reform (Faculty Senate. Under-
graduate Council, Faculty of Arts
and Sciences Council, and the Cur-
riculum Review Committee) all
hold open meetings. “If students
came to these meetings and show-
ed genuine serious concern then
more change could be effected,"
said the Dean.

ONLY TWO student) organiza-
tions, Black Action Society and
Free University, have shown this
concern, according to Schneewind.
All student organizations — from
Young Republicans to the Greeks
— can be power sources for curri-
clum change, he feels, if they get
behind the issues.

SG Senator Lou Briskman be-
lieves that it is too difficult to get
students involved. Outside of a
small number of activists, he said,
no one knows the appropriate
channels for change. Schneewind
said that he did not know the prop-

er lines of communication either.
He mentioned a group of adminis-
trators that is presently studying
the bureaucracy in the University
to determine legitimate channels
for the information of students.

Schneewind desires more free-
dom in curriculum and bold exper-
imentation. He feels slightly ham-
pered by our. campus which he re-
ferred to as “a model of decorum
and apathy.” He chided the Uni-
versity community for being
“tense and timid from top to bot-
tom.”

THE DEAN intends to investi-
gate the feasibility of suspending
classes for several days in the\
fall to hold open meetings for the
discussion of curriculum review.

Schneewind wants innovations
to focus on smaller classes and
more individualized instruction.
He agreed with the students pre-
sent at the discussion that nearly
all requirements should be drop-
ped. Schneewind especially dis-.
likes obligation of a major. “Re-
quired courses,” he said, “are a
product ‘of the administration's
distrust of the students.”

Course evaluation, according to g
the Dean, is a potential student gf

power position. Schneewind and

the students felt that the past 

course evaluation was inadequate.

The dean. cited evaluation book-_ 

lets at other universities that have
been instrumental in voicing stu-
dent opinion and effecting change.

“WHERE DID we ever get the 
idea of four years or eight semes- 
ters as the ideal amount of time 
for an education?” Schneewin_d:_§§
wondered. He plans-to investigate 
systems that will run from three ;
to six years. This might include a 
pre-baccaulaureate term for in- 
coming freshmen who need re- 
medial work and/or a post-bac- 
caulaureate year for graduating 
seniors who desire more work in

emphasize.

ly a Teaching Fellow at the University. With his Nigerian back-

commentary .

emphasized the very positive
success of the post-revolution
government. Continuing this
emphasis in the body of his lec-
ture, he took exception to the term
and the concept of “anti-com-
munism.” He stated, “anti-com-
munism offers no positive alter-
native to problems of today. It is
merely ‘anti.”’ '

Believing that “a huge rev-
olution is sweeping the world
right now, leaving no place un-
touched,” Price sees the neces-
sity of “convincing Americans
of the necessity of an Ameri-
can revolution.”

This belief directs Prices’
attempts to break the “block-
ade of ideas” which surrounds
Cuba, and to set Cuba before
the world as an example of a suc-
cessful revolution.

Price maintained that the Cu-
ban people themselves are aware
of this position, and that they are
prepared to “step on the stage of
history and to make history.’-’

In Price’s terms, the Cu-
bans exhibit “social solidarity,”
a unified population which “sees
the aims of society and the world
as a whole as important.”

It is precisely this solidarity
which enables the Cuban peo-
ple to cope with the present cir-
cumstances of rationing, long
lines, hard work, and the Ameri-
can blockade.

Price explained the neces-

~ sity of these conditions, and com-

mented that America was not
built by workers on an eight-
hour day. He feels that such things
as rationing “eliminate dispar-
ity,” and that it is better forall to
have a little than for a few to
possess all.

Ultimately, Price feels that the
basic question concerning Cuba
is whether democracy can
exist under socialism. To this,
he answered, “Cuba is the most

democratic country on the face -
' of the earth today.” ‘

Some 75 full-time employees

adults and most with only a grade
or high -school education, are go-
ing to get an opportunity to go
to college at the University in a
program they helped design them-
selves.

The aim of the program "is to
geta ll .of the. participants into
the regular student stream after
a short period of inductory work.
Students will be able to take cour-
ses from throughout the Univer-
sity-s curriculum, although their
degree will be from the School of
General Studies.

The US "Office of Economic
Opportunity (OEO) is provid-
ing $43,000 for support of the
program in the first year, and the

The impatience of today’s uni-

in the events occuring at Cornell

few months.

CORNELL

Black students at Cornell,
by taking over the campus stu-

d ' dent center, forced the faculty

to’ rescind the diciplinary action

 1 of its judiciary against five black

students who participated in a
protest last December and Jan-
uary. The Cornell protest was
distinguished from others by the

' fact that students carried guns.

The black students armed them-
selves after a threat to their
safety by a band of white fra-
ternity men who disagreed with

. their position. -

  Trend Toward Confrontation May Lead To Fear”

The students occupied the buil-
ing for fortyeight hours. They
left peacefully after the Cornell
faculty decided to nullify judi-
cial proceedings against the five
black students. The faculty also
dicided to “create a broadly-
based body and recommend 0 the
whole community our future
course of action.” The faculty
resolution included a plea to
the students: “We hear you, we
care, we are trying to under-
stand you; and we want together
with you to do something.”

The tension at Cornell was only
slightly eased by the faculty’s
action. Panicked New York
legislators last week drew up
legislation against the students.
Many of Cornells black students
feel that the university’s racial
problems remain unsolved.

HARVARD

Harvard, in keeping with the
controntation trend, staged a
student strike which repudiated
the rights of the Harvard Corpora-
tion and closed down the univer-
sity. The strike was started by
SDS, but in the course of the strike,
several students “converted.”

Many of the converts had
previously deplored what they
called the “heavy handed rhe-
toric” of SDS publications. These

that they would draw attention
away from “general societal

Meeting With Schneewind

by DAVE TIERNAN
Editor, Pitt News

Was goin' to another stupid,
-was)e-of-time, say-alot-do-nothing,
meeting last night. SG President's
Cabinet or something. Felt obligat-
ed. Went. Then:

I couldn't believe my ears. There
seemed to be hope in this Universi-
ty at the very minute I was ready
to pack up and give it all up. I no-
ticed the others were digging Dean
$chneewind’s act, so I asked them
to give their impressions of his com-
ments. They follow. Read them,
please. Re-read the story on page

. one. There’s hope in the University.

Can you dig it?

The fallacy in the great Ameri-
can motto, “don’t stick your neck
out,” was vividly displayed to per-
haps a dozen people last night. In
a meeting with Dr. Schneewind,
the new Dean of the College, a
number of students were literally
given permission to make any
changes they saw fit within the
University. The answer, trite and
overused as it may sound, is in ac-
tion by the student body.

ELIZABETH ZICHERMAN
President, Panhellenic
Association

Now this sentence impliesmore
than is at first apparent; the key
is the phrase “student body”

' which does not mean SDS, BAS,

or any other minority, and possi-

‘bly unrepresentative, group. The

key to meeting demands is activa-
tion of that huge body of students
in the middle who aren’t demon-
strators, but do give a damn; the
students who often agree or sym-
pathize with actions of others on
campus, but who, for lack of guts
or other reasons, will not put

; themselves out on any limbs. This

   
 

is probably a fairly valid picture
of the average Pitt student, a pic-
ture which must change if this Uni-

versity intends to. Why? Because

the need for the sheer force of
numbers for any sort of effective-
ness demands it. A minority, quite
often unrepresentative, should not
go it alone. There’s only one an-
swer — wake up and become a
living part of the University. Apa-
thyis not the trend on this cam-
pus; silent concern is. This is

I what must be changed.

A SUZANN SLYMAN
President Pro Tem,
SG Senate

“If you can’t pronounce the last
name, call me Jerry. But please

, don’t call me Doctor Schneewind."

This was the first time I’d met
or heard our three—week-old tur-
tleneck-wearing dean of the Col-
lege of Arts and Sciences. For
abgut two hours; we just talked.
But unlike talking with many ad-
ministrators, this man had a very
human interest in students and
producing the type of academic

change and improvement that
would make course material
meaningful to students. We talked
of evaluating the instructors rath-
er than the courses. We talked of
giving the students the power to

- receive the type_of knowledge that

they want from the course. We
talked of doing away with a struc-
tured major, and a four year pro-
gram and requirements in genera-
al. We talked of designing courses
in community involvement. But
what is to come from talk. It was

all very interesting. Now it is the‘ It

time for any student, every stu-
dent to stand up and say, for in-
stance, “We want a department
of communication.” This is ‘all
that's needed in many cases. But
Mr. Scheewind will make it even
easier. Just drop into his office or
write him a letter, even send it
COD. We now have a man who is
interested in changing Pitt. Let’s
help by giving him our ideas and
criticisms. A small price for
change. ‘

VIRGINIA JOYCE
SG Senator

The push for student aware-
ness of the potential power they
could exert was the most signifi-
cant thing that emerged from the
discussion. One area that must be
expanded immediately is student
representation in a power vs. an
advisory position in all aspects of
relevant University Administra-
tion. Secondly, student pressure
groups must be made aware
(through the student publications
the grapevine, etc.) that they can
be effective working outside of
bogged-down bureacratic chan-
nels. Mr. Schneewind claimed to
be responsive to all forms of legi-
timate student pressure on the in-
dividual level, but especially when
demands are backed by the show
of interest and power.

The problem is to get students
aware of how far they can go in
getting rid of irrelevant courses
and incompetent professors. And
we’ll never know until we test it
out. Student lobbying, from both
an informal and a structured bas-
is, can work here if students make
use of what they have already, like
course evaluations, and work out
what they want to have, like some
control of tenure assignments. If
students realize that if they re

I repeat that the most impor-

satisfied students that, in the last
analysis, there can’t be a school
without students.

JUDITH LEWANDOWSKI

Student Government Senator

We talked about a lot of things
tonight. But mainly, we talked

g about trust. By nature hardly, by

conditioning most probably, “the
student” is a defensive individual.
He operates within a framework
of institutionalized threat. His ma-
jor concern, therefore, and a great
portion of his effort are directed
at circumventing such things as
“F’s” and poor recommendations.
Consequently, his major mode of
action is essentially non-action
even on those issues which he con-
siders important to his own wel-
fare. Skilled in such avoidance he
knows to whom not to ’say any-
thing, when not to voice an opin-
ion, and what points not to make.

This night such a.pattern was
somewhat broken down within a
small group of students. We talk-
ed to a dean about areas of major
concern to us. And this dean was
open, more than open to sugges-
tion and comment, in fact, he ov-
ertly solicited them. He presented
to us an avenue of reform in the
person of himself. In doing this he
began also to break down certain
preconcieved notions. of conflict
of interests and myths about its
necessary existence. After all, ed-
ucation is what we’re all about.

 

SCOTT BAUM

President, Student Government

In what was usually my devoid
of humanity office, there were 15
people tonight, or thereabouts. I
have attended in the past two
weeks, a dazzling array of com-
mittees, councils, and sundry
others, and this was the first
time in all this time that I have
really spoken with students. The
claim of non-representativeness
is an impossible one to disclaim
when it's essentially incumbent
upon the students to get involved.
I think we reached that conclusion
tonight. It is not easy to fight dai-
ly for the kinds of changes you con-
sider imperative in the Universi-
ty. It takes a real working know-
ledge of how the University func-
tions, and that requires work. And
yet it seems to me-that my pri-
mary concern. whether it be evi-
denced by opening meetings of the
Board of Trustees or modifying
the language requirement. -is to
open up the structure in such‘ a
way that anyone can become a part
of the change that goes on. We

The ideas presented at the
meeting with Dean Scheewind are-
n’t exactly revolutionary. They
are thoughts which have been toss-
ed around by many students dur-
ing the past year but which have
usually been voiced only in small
groups. The talk centered around

‘more student participation in edu-

cation, in joining with the profes-
sors in planning interesting and
fruitful classes; in coming to Pitt
for a meaningful education; in liv-
ing and communicating; not in
just learning from books. But stu-
dents must get out and state our
wants and needs without fear of
penalties. We must become in-
terested and act with the faculty
and administrators to make Pitt
the kind of school we want it to be
—not to be content until this end
is achieved. This next year may
see remarkable changes in man-y
policies — we must help these po-
licies reflect the interests of Pitt’s
undergraduatesu This coming
year promises to-'be an exciting
and rewarding one for those stu-
dents who care to. see changes ini-
tiated and made. ‘

A lot of good, thought provok-
ing ideas were thrown out last
night in a meeting with the new
Dean of the College of Arts and
Sciences, Dr. Schneewind. The
ideas concerned the essential rea-
son for being at the University—to
get an education and to get the
best education possible right here
and now. Both the students who
were present and Dr. Schneewind
expressed the need for sweeping
changes in curriculum, require-
ments and teacher performance,
among many others. And accord-
ing to Dr. Schneewind, there will
be changes, whether his office re-
ceives student pressure or not.
“If the students pressure, the
changes can be quicker and more
efficient," he commented, “but
there are going to be changes.”

A lot of students who attended
the meeting had done a lotof
thinking about these problems be-
forehand. For a few others. per-
haps this was the first real pon-
dering about tackling any academ-
ic reforms.

Since the final exam period of
last term. I've been home loafing.
I hadn't given much, if any.

Thursday’s meeting with Dr.
Schneewind presented the stu-
dents there with the ideas and
plans of an exciting dean. He
brought to our attention that deans
are not inaccessable —— at least this
one isn’t. He welcomes our ideas
concerning every aspect of our ed-
ucation — and had a few sugges-
tions for us as representatives of
the student body at Pitt. We had
suggestions for him, too. Plans
for course —— or better yet, evalua-
tion were brought up. Methods of
getting rid of a course, changing
the teacher, or doing just about
anything with a course were sug-
gested. Gripes were heard con-
cerning language requirements,
availability of teachers, flunking
out, and many other relevant is-
sues concerning your education.

. : .7315

The major point, I feel, that was’

brought out is that there is some-
thing you can do about your educa-
tion. You don’t have to sit back

and take everything that is thrown Q_. A

at you. If enough students are gen-
uinely concerned about an issue,
something can be done about it.
Go see the Dean, talk to your prof,
gripe to your fellow students, and
do something about it! Dr. Schnee-
wind stressed the benefits . that
can be had by airing your opinions,
getting concerned about what con-
cerns you, and his willingness to
help in any way.
JONATHAN KATES

Student Government Senator

The student need no longer fear "

his longtime nemesis, ‘the admin-
istrator. In Dr. Schneewind, the
new dean of the college, we have a
friend who understands the prob-
lems of the student and who in-
tends to do something about them.
What impressed me about Dr.
Schneewind was his sincere de-
sire to improve the quality of edu-

cation at Pitt, and his willingness /

to put this ‘as his “A-1 top prior-

wind, or for that matter any’ ad-
ministrator, cannot make any
changes by himself. The impetus
must come from the student body,
whether it be SDS, MDC, the
Greeks, or the Commuters. Its up
to YOU as a student to say some-
thing. Right now the higher-ups
are very receptive to student com-
plaints. Next month may be a dif-
ferent story. ‘

Fresh air is blowing through the

The Dean met with the masses
this evening. Not in his plush of-
fice — not in the Faculty Club but
in the Student Glovernment of-
fice. A Dean who has traveled the
corridors of the Student Union. (A
Dean actually came to see us!)
He sat among us.

We spoke as equals. He listens
and he responds. Dodging nothing.
He doesn’t run. He’s concerned.
He’s human. He will slum it with
the masses and the masses will
love him.

We spoke as old friends. The us-
ual discdmforts of such a meeting,
the clockwatching, the groping

Black Prof’s Past Sparks Course

by RICK GOLDBLUM

Mrs. Frenchie Campbell is 40,
solidly built, and has satin brown
skin. ' ‘

Mrs. Campbell is here on a short
term exchange program, arranged
by Dr. Watanabe of the YMCA,
bringing her from the English
Dept. of all-black Jackson State

I College. She has spent the past

two weeks in charge of our own
English 182, a black literature
course. I am one of her students.

I HAD BEEN TOLD by a
southern black student that teach-
ers who are products of that seg-
regated southern machine are
usually quite good, as a result
of both the high competition in-
volved in the schooling, and the
fact that education is one of the
only outlets for blacks. Mrs.
Campbell is from exactly that
type of system.

She is from Oxford, Mississippi,
which is adjacent to Faulkner’s
Yoknopotapha County, and if
your skin is satin brown there,
Mr. Faulkner has described how
you are treated.

of her analysis of the book:

ed her at the age of 13 to call
the children of the family for
whom she then worked “Mr. Jun-
ior,” and only recently allowed
her” . . . a first glimpse of equal
treatment in 1962 at an Eng-
lish Teacher's Institute.”

Mrs. Campbell usually has a
pencil in her hand as she talks,
and she draws circles and ‘some-
times heavy straight lines. When
she looks up she meets your eyes
directly.

More important than the facts
that she has worked no matter
what else she has been doing since
the age of 9, her study at
Booker T. Washington School and
Oklahoma University, and even
more important than her three
children, Mrs. Campbell told me
some things: “If what you have,”
she said, “is what you really
earn, you have within you a re-
lexation a cheater cannot get.”

2.-Seven Unearned Tallies

by ED CONLEY

 It is often better to give than to receive, but not in base-
f ball. The baseball team learned that against the Gettysburg
S College Bullets Wednesday when they lost a 9-6 decision at

 The mitters committed five errors in the game and four of them were
,.placed perfectly with a few Gettysburg hits. Seven unearned runs re-

bal1” due to the tape that was on
his finger.

First baseman Frank Gustine
relieved Niccols in the sixth.

His shoulder started to give _

him trouble an inning later, but
before he departed the first earn-
ed run for the Bullets was on the
boards when catcher Hal Keller
doubled home Don Beauman.

“We’ve got all sore arms,” Lew-
is noted. I don't know why. It’s
not from over work.”

He was able to find a'mounds—
man with a sound arm to finish
the game, though. Rich Orp-
neck retired Gettysburg in the
final three innings, giving up
four hits. However, big runs
scored in the ninth, although two of
them were unearned.

The mitters made it look like

.they.were going to come back

in their half of the ninth.With-
out those three runs in Gettys-
burg’s half they would havemade
it.

Paul Hergenroeder’s bases
loaded single highlighted the
mitters rally, driving in two of

I the inning’s three runs. The re-

ceiver had one other rbi in the
mitters’ fourth loss in eight
games.

SUMMER
. .SOFTBALL LEAGUE

Leo Bemis, director of intra-
mural sports at the University,
announced that ther will be

a Summer Softball League
during the spring session of the
third trimester.

The league is opened to
all students, faculty, and staff.
Students not enrolled in either
of the two sessions of the sum-
mer term, but who were enrol-
led in either of the first two
trimesters, are eligible to par— '
ticipate.

The slow pitch softball league
will consist of 10-man teams.
The first round champion will
be decided by the end of the
first session. ‘

All applicants must enter the
league by this afternoon.

Last year, eighteen teams
competed in the spring ses-
sion softball intramurals, in-
cluding nine graduate and nine
undergraduate teams.

wouldn’t have much difficulty
in filling it. The depth problem
which has loomed ominously
over the tracksters’ early suc-
cesses, may be painfully feld
again in tomorrow’s dual meet
with Wayne University.

“It could be a pretty tight
meet,” reflected Banner. “We’re
definitely going to have problems
in some areas. We don’t even have
a pole vaulter anymore.”

Tomorrow’s meet gets under
way at 1:30 p.m. Admission to
Wayne University comes to the Pllbllcls free.

Bryant Salter, recovering from
a heel injury sustained last March,
may be in the form which he sport-
ed in his successful indoor sea-
son this past winter. Salter has
been struggling during the young
outdoor season, and had a par-
ticularly frustrating and some-
what disappointing outing in last
week’s Big Four Track Classic.

“Bryant looked a lot better
in practice this past week,” re-
marked Banner. As far as all these
injuries are concerned, I’ve just
never seen anything like it. I’m
sure the boys will do a good job
Saturday, but we're going to have
to switch some things around.”

If the golfers think they had trouble earlier in the week,
they can consider this afternoon and tomorrow’s competition
even more one-sided.

Tuesday afternoon, the golf team played against Indiana State
(Pa.) and Kent State, in a triangular competition meet. Before the con-
test started, the golfers had never beaten Kent State and had managed
only one victory against Indiana State in the past five years. The golfers

couldn’t turn the tide and lost Others have pretty good chances,”

IS ANYBODY LISTENING TO CAMPUS

VIEWS .7 , .,

BUSINESSMEN ARE.

Three chief executive officers— The Goodyear Tire &
Rubber Company's Chairman, Russell DeYoung,
The Dow Chemical Company's President,

H. D. Doan, and Motorola's Chairman, Robert
W. Ga/vin—are responding to serious questions
and viewpoints posed by students about
business and its role in our changing society . . .
and from their perspective as heads of major

‘corporations are exchanging views through

means of a cainpusl corporate Dialogue Program

Mr. Doan:

on specific issues raised by leading
student spokesmen.

All of these Dialogues will appear in this

publication, and other campus newspapers across

the country, throughout this academic year.
Campus comments are invited, and should be
forwarded to Mr. De Young, Goodyear, Akron,
Ohio,‘ Mr. Doan, Dow Chemical, Midland,
Michigan,‘ or Mr. Ga/vin, Motorola, Franklin
Park, lllinois, as appropriate.

Here. David M_But/er, completing his studies in
Electrical Engineering at Michigan State, is

Dear Mr. Doan:

There currently is a great deal of debate
about social responsibility in today's
society. People have become much more
aware of their responsibilities which
accompany the many personal benefits

in our society. Business firms should be
just as aware of their social responsi-
bilities: firms can no longer ignore racial
injustice, the inner city, pollution of our
environment, and the many other problems
that face our society. But they would
seem to or the basis of indirect evidence. -

For example, increasing local tax revenues
is one way topromote local action in
problem solution. Why is it, then, that

an "attractive" tax base is one of the
main selling points for Chambers of
Commerce trying to lure firms to locate
in their area? The clear implication is that
firms want to bypass their obligation to
pay for the services they receive from

the community. Why should others, who
make up the remainder of the tax base,
take up slack for business? Firms benefit
from the educational system, utilities,
roads, and the many other community
services. Even more so, perhaps, than
any other single taxpayer. .

A better approach would be to see that
tax revenues are effectively utilized in the
best interest of the community. Business-
men should apply their special abilities
to the problem of creating efficiency in

‘both revenue collection and expenditure.

Business could lead rather than appear to
exploit society in this connection.

Today's student would be much more
interestedain working-_f.or:.a firm-that  .
emphasized providing constructive advice
rather than one that is quibbling over a
few extra dollars in assessments. An
active, sincere interest in society-not
just superficial action such as joining the
local Chamber of Commerce—«wouId do
much to change young peoples view of
business and its motives. Profit is a
necessary but not sufficient condition for
a firm's existence in today's society.
Students are as much concerned about
how companies utilize their resources to
shoulder a fair share of responsibility in
society as for the generation of profits.

Sincerely yours,

Dear Mr. Butler:

Let's consider your proposition—that
today's student is terribly concerned about
social responsibilities, and that profit is
not a sufficient condition for a firm's
existence in society_—from the perspective
of business’ basic objectives.

_ Business exists because it is of service to

humanity. It accomplishes this service
using the discipline of profits as a relatively
impartial measure of performance, and
through the development of the individual.
There must be a balance between these
three factors . . . an imperfect but direct
correlation.

Maximum long-term profitsis consistent
with, and cannot be achieved without,
maximum service to society. Maximum
service to society can be achieved only
through the maximum development and
release of the ability of individuals. And
maximum release of individual abilities
brings about maximum profit growth.

In the structure of our society, of the free
enterprise system, business essentially

is an economic instrument, and it can be
of service as a social instrument only
indirectly. If it charges in to straighten out
the nation's social problems, as many on‘
the campus would like to see, it will cease
to perform effectively its basic functions
as an economic instrument.

This does not mean that business is
indifferent to social problems or that it
is not working toward practical solutions.

Take industry's efforts to reduce the

..pollution of our environment, as an

instance. Many companies have been
instituting controls-over air and water
wastes at their production facilities. At
Dow Chemical, we have expended
approximately $10—million at our plants in
Midland, Michigan, alone, with an annual
upkeep cost of a million dollars.

Along with this program,.we have made

a "business" out of Environmental Control.
Research and development alone costs
$1-million annually. This program has been
made possible only through the discipline
of profit, which brings me back to my
starting point: Service to society is
achieved only through accomplishment of
our primary objective-—maximum long-
term profit growth.

To me, the social involvement from this is
quite clear. If business is to respond to

the challenge of the times, to work toward
solutions worthy of human effort and

skill, there must be value systems, and an
environment that favors highly moral,
ethical behavior This is the responsibility
of management, industry_at large, and
society as a whole. lmplicitly, there is a

questioning Mr. ‘Doan. A member of the Dean's
Advisory Committee, Mr. Butler also participates
actively in professional engineering organizations
on campus,‘ anticipates graduate studies

before developing his career.

/n the course of the entire Dialogue Program,
Stan Chess,_./ourna/ism major at Cornell, also
will probe issues with Mr. Doan; as will Mark
Bookspan, a Chemistry major at Ohio State, and

David G. Clark, in graduate studies at Stanford,

with Mr. DeYoung,' and similarly, Arthur M. '

K/ebanoff, in Liberal Arts at Yale, and Arnold

Shelby, Latin American Studies at Tulane, 1
with Mr. Galvin. . '

need for government policies and rules to
match these much improved value
systems, and to insure that industry's
efforts are of maximum benefit to all.

On this basis, let me turn your question

on taxes around. There is not a single

thriving community today whose health

doesn't come from jobs; primarily, jobs

provided by industry. 4’

Look at the impact made on any
community through a new industry moving
in. For every hundred people on its

payroll, there will be 165 newjobs
throughout the community, bank deposits
increase by over $229,000 annually and
retail salesjump accordingly.

So, Chambers of Commerce, in their
competitive efforts to promote community
growth, historically have offered tax
incentives to attract industries to their
area. I say historically because I don't 4
think this is now the paramount considera-
tion for plant re—Iocation. It simply is a
factor along with other business reasons
and aspects of community environment:
availability of decent housing and
convenient retail shopping . . . of properly
accredited schools with sufficient class-
room space. . . of churches . of
recreational facilities . . . and the whole
range of municipal services. And no
responsible business enterprise will

shirk payment of its proportionate share
of the taxes required for the supports

of its community. '

I disagree with your suggestion, however,
that it is up to business to assure
effective utilization of tax revenues. This
would attribute powers to business that
it doesn't have, smacks strongly of
paternalism, and implies a better ability
oh the part of an industrial concern to
solve the community's problems than the
community itself has.

This is not to say that individual business-
men shouldn't advise their communities
on taxes or other matters within their
personal competence and experience . .
but as private citizens with a sense of
civic responsibility, and not speaking for
a particular business entity.

What it all boils down to is that the 4*-
objectives of society's principal

institutions are well-defined. By each

continuing in its own orbit, doing what it

best can do, the social responsibilities of

the times can be met more effectively.

and society's needs better served:

H. D. Doan
