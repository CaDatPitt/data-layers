And she did it all last night in one hour. ..

Unforttmately I or Gertz, she can’t remember
most of -that hour, because it occurred during the Pitt
Program Council—sponsored show of hypnotist Ken

»Whitener. She “went under” along with 10 other Pitt

students in the Union assembly room. ' - , .
“I remember that I was in a race and I-had a

teddy bear,” she ‘said after the show. But beyond ,

those details, she admits she is clueless.
Before the show, Whitener said that he has the

- “most fun” performing for college audiences.

Although corporate events offer special‘ perks and
first class accommodations, college students like to
“have fun and tryvnew things.’.’ «. . ,

Whitener received his ﬁrst magic book at age 8,
and when he was 11, Whitener hypnotized. his first
client, a school buddy. He learned how to hypnotize
from an encyclopedia in his elementary school
library. ’

“I told him-to count to 20 very‘ slowly and at
about 12 he was out like alight,” he said. “It scared
theheck out of me because I didn’t know what wasi
going on.” ' —

Fortunately, Whitener was able- to count to

three, snap and wake up his friend; Ever since then,

he knewhe wanted to perform, and he has. ’
Whitener said he is a ﬁrm believer that laughter
is the best medicine. And he was very successful at

making his audience laugh. ' . r A
“Ladies and gentleman, welcome,” boomed the '

speakers as Whitener walked on stage with slicked
back, tliiclggray hair and a black tuxedo;

He began by explaining that hypnosis, is the
power of suggestion, a way to relax, concentrate and
use your imagination. Then he switched modes,
his audience. _ _ . .

“Before you all came,- my wife placed my busi-
ness card under seven‘ of your chairs,” -Whitener
said. He_ said those audience members with the card

from instructional to comical, by playing a joke on

would receive a ‘free T—shirt_ and CD,

The audience ‘responded immediately by pok-
ing their head between their legs and peering under
their chairs. .  ’ V I V

“Just joking,’_’ Whitener laughed. “I say stupid
things and some of you believe it.” ‘ ‘ L

Then he called those who desired to “go under”
up onto the stage. Those willing jumped up. from
their chairs and rushed the stage to- secure their place
in the spotlight. . - '

But it wasn’t that easy.

‘Professor of Poolology’ instructs

crowd of 50 in William Pitt Union

AMITY SANZONE

Staff Writer

' Christopher Fraser, a
novice pool player, chal-
lenged
Poolology” Jack White to a
short version of eight ball
yesterday afternoon.

“I was not especially ner-
vous, it was enlightening,”
said Fraser, a freshman genet-
ics and biology major.

White, an internationally
famous trick shot W artist,
brought his wit and skills to
the Pitt Program Council-
sponsored billiards exhibition
in the William-Pitt» .Union
Recreation Room yesterday.

“I never had a job. I
watched people raking leaves
one time and I got blisters,”
White said.

-White, who was born in
New York in 1932, has played

pool for 61 years. His dad"

played and his uncle was a
world champion. White joked
that his talent “might be
hereditary.”

“The ' Professor .of_

White said he is the only
player to ever be invited to
the White House. And since
pool is. his profession, he
treats it like so, carrying
around his custom pool stick
in a special black case.

Standing in a black tuxedo
and bow tie with a red hand-
kerchief poking from his coat
pocket, White held the atten-
tion of about 50 ‘audience
members at any given time
during his hour-and-a-half
show. ,

White taught audience
members some of his shots.
One man learned how to per-
form “The Queen of
England’s Favorite Trick” by

shooting a pool ball into a-

brown paper bag and into the
corner pocket without break-
ing a hole in the bag.

To the amazement of the
audience, the bag flipped.as
the ball entered, spitting-it out

‘of the other side and into the

pocket. .

He coached the student
through the complicated
shots.

“You shot it" too low, hit it
high,” White said while tap-
ping a student’s back.

“Go ahead, nice shot.‘ I’ll
tell you honestly and I’m
being straight, you do turnme

‘ on.”‘

* Adding to White’s' pool"
talent is his sense of humor.-
The audience seemed to stop?

laughing ‘only to take a breath.

“The most’ _ money I’_ve
ever made in one night was a
lot,” joked White. “I made
more money in one night in
fourhours than the president

‘has made illegally. And ‘I did,

Underthe

stars and

on the raging river  

KARA WILSON

 

Staff Writer

The Pitt Outdoors Club enjoyed
an exhilarating weekend away from

~ Oakland when it spent Friday night

camping under the stars and the

entire day Saturday white water raft- ‘

ing on the Youghiogheny ‘River.

At 5'p.m. Friday, 34 members of
he Outdoors Club eagerly gathered
in front of the Union carrying back-
packs,- sleeping bags and tents, each V
person anxious to escape city life
and indulge in the much needed ’

freshair of Ohiopyle State Park.

The atmosphere was filled with
anticipation and ' a readiness to
embark on an adventure full of new

challenges while the club waited for

the three Pitt vans_ that would drive
them to i the rapids of the
Youghiogheny.

“I love to’go on these trips,” said

sophomore Kierstin Homblette. .“It’s
T a nice way to get out of Oakland.”

When the vans arrived,‘ each per-
so'n’s.bag was hastily thrown into the_
back and the group hurried to find a.
seat to prepare for a prompt depar-
ture. _ S . »

.When each van arrived " at
Ohiopyle, students separated into

small groups and set up tents, which I

extended over’ 10 campsites.
To some, the act of setting up

I camp was an adventure in itself. The‘

sun had gone down and each group’s
tent had‘ to be. set up in complete
darkness. Many groups brought

-ﬂashlights to help in the endeavor,
. but those that did not quickly
T learned the importance of teamwork.

‘ When each tent had been
pitched, the group united to eat a
meal under the stars. Many students
made sandwiches or used stoves -to
cook soup and Various canned goods.

After dinner, the group gathered
around a campfire for warmth and
feasted on classic outdoors desserts
like roasted marshmallows and

‘s’mores while talking and getting to,

know each other.

Some students brought guitars
and serenaded the group while others
simply gazed at the star-filled sky.

“We found a clearing and just

looked at the stars,” "said sophomore
Sara -Doll. “You can’t see stars in the
city.” - " j .
The club awoke Saturday from
its night outdoors with renewed
excitement as students faced the
beautiful, cloudless day. ‘

By 11 a.m., bags were packed,

sleeping bags were rolled, and tents p A

were taken down and stored. The

club was ready to tame the wild

waters of the Youghiogheny River.
Many rafters rented a wet suit,

hoping that the suit would keep them

warm-in the river’s chilly water.

When each. person was dressed
and ready, the club divided them-
selves into six groups of rafting
teams with at least one experienced
rafter in each boat. Before embark-
ing on theirtrip, the club listened to
a safety speech aboutthe dangers of
the rapids. '

Club -members learned the

importance of keeping their feet up i

if. they fell into: the water.‘ Rather

_ than fighting the rapids, rafters who

fall out of the boat should simply let_
the rapid carry them to calmer
waters. ' ' I" ,

At 1:30 p.m., the club picked up
its rafts, carried them to the river’s
edge and began the white water
adventure. - '

During the course of the trip, the
club battled withnature ‘while being
exposed to its many beauties.

The Outdoors Club became
problem solvers when the rafts
repeatedly became stuck on top of
large rocks jutting up from the
river’s depths. <

At one point, when the rafts
encountered Dimple Rock, the most
challenging obstacle of the river, two
of the six" rafts capsized and‘ six
rafters weretossed overboard.

The swimmers followed their
given instructions and body-surfed

to calmer waters, escaping danger~

with only a few minor bruises.
At 6 p.m.,’ the exhausted club
members pulled their rafts out of the

river and prepared for the journey I

back to Oakland.

“The trip was an absolute blast,” I

said freshman Joe Gordon. “The
water was pretty chilly but once‘ your
adrenaline got pumping, ~youtcould—
n’t even feel it.” i f

on the trip home, a members

spoke excitedly about their adven-
'tures and thought that the trip was a .

huge success.
.‘‘-It’s really empowering,” said
freshman Clare Sierawski. “I felt

like I really accomplished something ,

‘this weekend.” I V V
The Outdoors Club is ‘open to

any Pitt students who want to expe- v_

rience the outdoors. The club holds
meetings.every Tuesday at 8:20 p.m.

in Room 1K56 in Posvar Hall. _

Anyone interested in joining the club
is invited to attend.

Program will provide meningitis vaccination

MARIANNA GLUSHETS

‘The Pitt News

The American College Health
Association estimates that 100 to 125
cases of meningococcal meningitis
occur annually on college campuses.
Five to 15 of those students die each
year as a result. .

There are many ways for students -

to protect themselves against the

threat of meningitis. Eating a bal-

anced diet, getting adequate sleep and

~ exercise and avoiding the excessive

intake of alcohol maximize the
body’s immune response. '
Another line of defense is, being

a vaccinated against the disease.’

VACCESS Health, a company
that provides such» immunizations,
will be conducting the Meningitis

Immunization Outreach Program on .

campus tomorrow."

The event will take place in the ,

William Pitt Union Ballroom from 1
p.m. to 7 p.m. Students must pay a
$75 fee, which can be billed to the
student’s home address or a credit
card. "In some cases, thefee may be
reimbursement by the student’s insur-
ance company. I “ S t u d e n t
Health has offered the vaccine in pre-
vious years, this yearTwe made the

‘decision to hire VACCESS because

they are better able to advertise their
service and they provide their own
experienced staff. We want to make
surernore students get this vaccine,”
said Anita Bostjancic, a business
administrator with the . University’s
Student Health Services‘. . -

7 I Meningitis is a bacterial infection
’ that causes inﬂammation of the mem- -

branes surrounding the brain and

A spinal cord. Its symptoms include

fever, severe headache, stiff neck,

Correction

In Monday’s Pitt News, Christine
Leed was incorrectly identiﬁed in
“Students, stage pro—choice counter-
protest” as Christine Reed. Also,

nausea and lethargy. The infection
can lead to permanent disabilities
such as hearing loss and brain dam-
age.
According to VACCESS Health,
approximately [10 percent of people
with meningitis die from the ‘disease.
The infect-ion is spread by direct con-
tact with infected individuals, such as
by sharing a glass or cigarette, or
kissing. It may also be spread through

the air through coughing or sneezing. i

In the past the disease was most
common among children. Lately,
however, the risk seems to be shifting
toward older children and adoles-

g . . .i -
' cents, with a rising number of out-

breaks in universities, according to

ACHA. . . «
Althoughthe reasons for this rise

are not yet fully understood, it seems

‘that college students are more sus-

ceptible because they live and work
close. to each other in residence halls
and classrooms.

Lifestyle may also be a factor.
Exposure to smoking and alcohol
increase the risk of contacting menin-
gitis. , ' ’

“Community living and eating

‘ seems to be a factor in the transmis-

sion of meningitis, while this disease
is not very common, it is very seri-
ous,” said Bostjancic.

This vaccine is strongly recom-

— mended by the Advisory Committee

on Immunization Practices for col-
lege undergraduates, particularly
those living in dormitories. I

The vaccine has an excellent
safety record. Side effects consist of

' rednesslaround the injection site. The

vaccine should, however, be deferred
during any acute illness.

There are numerous public health
agencies that serve as a resource for
information about meningococcal
disease and vaccination. For further

tests. The ladies went first by shaking out
the tension in their ﬁngers, squeezing
their hands together in front of of them
and closing their eyes, while subliminal
music played in the background.

“Your hands are superglued together.
The harder you pull the harder they seem
to stick,” Whitener said in a deep voice.
He talked rapidly and repeated his state-

_ Il'l€I1tS . V '

As the ladies fell into deep sleep,
they also literally fell backward, but the

male hypnosis contestants caught them '
before they reached the ﬂoor.

From this test, Whitener chose the
women he wanted for his show. Then it

was time for the men’s test. »,

“You need to keep your hands out of
your pockets, this is ,a family show,”

' Whitener said when the men took stage.

Astest similar to the ladies’ test was
given to the guys. And three’ of them
ended up on the ﬂoor of the stage
because Whitener made them believe

they were superglued there. ,

When they awoke from their hypnot-
ic slumber and tried to get up off the
ﬂoor, they couldn’t, ' »

“I can’t get up!” complained_ one stui

One student became angry at the
audience laughing at her. Whitener
instructed her to express her feelings.

“Stop laughing at me. Knock it off,”
she said. She also stared at the audience
with evil eyes and ﬂipped them the im-
ger.

scream at the audience in Chinese, which
she did. Then she performed tae kwon do

When heleft the stage, Whitener had
another student believing she was

ly to “Oops!  I Did It Again.” A

“I love you. Thank you very much.
Try your hardest and don’t let anybody
tell you you can’t,” said “Britney” as she
left the stage. »

’For the closing act, the three remain-

as theLord of Dance in “Riverdance.”
Their fmale included, dancing like the
world’s best female impersonators.

The three men were instructed to go
into the audience shirtless and dance
with the “three best-looking guys in the

audience.” One student even went so far
as dance with another man while rubbing
his white T—shirt around his neck.

Before snapping the students out of

“under” that they will have the best sleep
that they have ‘had in- 30 days. ‘

And all of them eventually woke up.

Leah Greenspoon, a Pitt sophomore,
said she felt really weird after waking up.-

Greenspoon said.

Gertz, on ' the other hand, didn’t
know what people were talking about

EDITORIAL

SGB needs to focus on issues
not internal squabbles

Sometimes it’s hard to avoid

getting hung up on the little things"

in life. That’s why cliches such as
“make sure you can see the forest
for the trees”.»are born into exis-
tence. It’s human —— but when you
are a group of leaders who yield
considerable power on your col-
lege campus, you really should try
to concentrate on issues of sub-
stance and sincere importance.
Sadly, our Student
Government Board is diverting its
attention from directly helping the
students so that it can settle yet
another internal squabble.
Disagreement among board mem-
bers rippled through Monday’s
meeting as board member Dave
Lander raised concerns about the
Constitutional Review Committee
that the board voted to form last
spring. Lander asserted that the
CRC was not heeding concerns
raised by the board or inviting the
board to meetings. He also chal-
lenged the allotment of funds to
pay for voting booths that the CRC
wanted to rent for an October ref-
erendum, in: which students will
have the opportunity to .vote on
whether SGB should hold elections
in the spring rather than in the fall.
By a 5-4 vote, the allocation was

‘ultimately approved.

This is certainly not the first
time that SGB has focused its time
and energy on settling disputes
related to internal procedure. When
Nick Laughlin resigned last
January, weeks of discussion, vot-

ing and plenty of bickering ensued ’ ‘ "'

before Andy Godek was finally

‘ chosen as a replacement.

Such squabbles prevent» SGB
from focusing on issues that affect
more than those students who are
directly involved with the board. In
the weeks before last year’s elec-
tions, many‘ candidates proposed
exciting and innovative plans.
Lander, for example, sought to
convince Pitt to buy more comput-
ers and introduce online class reg-
istration to the University. Board
members Sharooz Bhopti and J o’ie
Taylor’s platform included work-
ing to get more students on the
Board of Trustees, offering stu-
dents reduced~fare airline tickets
around holidays and creating a cul-
tural center in Oakland.

Before elections, talk of such

‘lofty goals" is abundant — but

months later, goals actually ful-
ﬁlled are few. When our board is
perpetually engaged in petty argu-
ments that have more to’ do with-
ego than issue, it is no surprise that
so little actually gets done.

  Area clergy right o

  support same-sex beneﬁts  

As most members of our campus communi-
ty are undoubtedly aware, the University of
Pittsburgh has been embroiled for several years in
a legal battle over proposed health
beneﬁts for the domestic partners of
lesbian and gay faculty and staff.
The conﬂict stems from a lawsuit .
ﬁled several years ago by former Pitt
writingvinstructor Deborah Henson

7 after the University  to extend health‘ben-
eﬁts to her female partner. Additional plaintiffs .

later joined Henson in her suit.

This ongoing controversy has been assource
of division and pain within our community. But
recently a group of voices offered its prescription
for healing. « - , '

'1hat group consists of ﬁve area clergy:
Rabbi Jarnes,Gibson of Temple Sinai; The Rev.
Robert Chesnut,_senior pastor at East’ Liberty
Presbyterian Church; the Rev. Harold T. Lewis,
Rector of Cavalry Episcopal Church; Father Jack
O’Malley,' pastor of St Jude Roman Catholic
Church in Wﬂmerding and the Rev. Ruth Becker,
 of the University’s own Lutheran
StudentCenter. r » . - .

Several members of the groupspoke at a
news conferenceon Sept. 28, at which they
released a statement calling for “reconciliation
between the parties involved in the lawsuit.”
Speciﬁcally, they recommended that the plaintiffs
drop their lawsuit and, in exchange, the
University extend beneﬁts to  committed
same—sex partners of ‘its employees. Both the
statement and the news conference were orga-
nized by another area minister, the Rev. Michael
Penn-Strah,’ oo-pastor of the North Side’s Open

I read with great interest Bill Schackner’s
report on the news conference for the Pittsburgh
Post-Gazette, and then I contacted Penn-Strah,

. the interfaith group’s statement
As a longtime student both of the Bible and i
I of the history of Judeo-Christian religious groups,

I was struck by the signiﬁcance of
this latest development in the
domestic partner beneﬁts controver-
 all, many other Judeo-

v sent—have opposed measures that
extend support to -same-sex couples. 8
Moreover, this opposition has also been
directed towards other kinds of r“altemative” rela-
tionships. Interracial couples and ‘interfaith cou-

_ ples have also been disrespected and disenfran-

chised by narrow—minded religious leaders.
In fact, interracial marriages were illegal in

some parts of the United States until .1967. Sadly, ..

marryChristianssupportedtl1istypeofdiscrimi-

nation, In his 1958 book “Segregation and the» 8

Bible,” Methodist minister Everett Trlson strong-
ly criticized the practice of to the Bible
in order to justify the oppnessioniof 
families. And even‘ after a 1967 Supreme Court

decision invalidated the laws against intenacral ; '

rmrnag , private  instituﬁorrs like Bob
Jones University have continued to marginalize
 couples. ' «. ’ .
I am proud or Penn-Strah and his colleagues
who I believe are carrying forward the torch held

by Tilson in the'_l950s. Yes, voices within the;
 and.Jewish communities will always ’

disagree on such issues as interracial and inter-
faith marriage, as well as on homosexual unions.
But these area clergy remind us that regardless of
our beliefs, all families should be treated with fair-
ness and  .

Michael J. .Mazza hopes that all members of our

university, community will listen carqﬁclly to the
prophetic witness of Michael Penn-Strah and his
colleagues. ‘ . .

Americans deserve more than 40 percent democracy

Currently, the Commission on

a Presidential Debates requires a presidential

candidate to  15 percent support
through a series of ﬁve national polls in order
to participate in its» sanctioned debates.
Although both John Anderson (Independent
candidate, 1980) and  Perot (1992
Independent candidate and 1996 Reform
Party candidate) never attained this level of
support, the CPD still allowed them to par-
ticipate in debates in 1980 and 1992, respec-
tively. As a result; these proved record years
forboth debate viewership-and voter turnout.
i In 1996, however, the CPD excluded
Ross Perot and" voter turnout dropped. '
Apparently we can expect the continued‘
demise of public participation this year in
our so called “democracy,” as the CPD will
exclude both Green Party candidate Ralph
Nader and Reform; Party candidate Pat
Buchanan from the presidential debates. The
CPD, we must note, is run exclusively by
Republicans and Democrats under a thin and
deceptive veil of impartiality. _ .

I realize most people won’t be dropping

reality, I ﬁnd it ﬁiglltening that 86 man}? per i

expect that less than 40 percent of the eligi-

‘two heads onthe same monster, each claim-

our citizens, we may improve the condition

in lawmaking bodies. The sooner we vote

for a third-party candidate if any Americans

Lamont does not
deserve the  
blame for season

Gene Lamont did not make the
Pirates a bad team. -

Lamont did not force Warren
Morris to hit .259 this season. Nor
did he encourage. Kevin Young.to
get on base at a clip of .311, -his
usual batting average. .

No, it is the Pirate players who
are responsible" for the abysmal
wash of a season that has dragged on
for what seems like a7 full calendar
year

Unfortunately, no one in the
Pirates management was able to
come to any of these conclusions, as
they officially announced Lamont’s
release at a press conference
Monday morning, less than 24 hours’
after the Pirates played their final
game of the season.

The team earned a meager 69-93
record this year, finishing in fifth
place in the National League Central.
Division, in a season that owner
Kevin McClatchy had predicted 90
wins. ‘ . V i

Lamont said that he didn’t antic-
ipate achieving -that high level, but
that he was still disappointed with
both the season and his firing.

He left in histypically classy
manner, refusing to blame
McClatchy for his- termination.

“Kevin’s taken -a lot of heat
because maybe he handled’ this
wrong,” Lamont said. “I don’t want
to make Kevin out to be the bad’
guy.” .

But he easily could have done
that. Local papers reported several
weeks ago that Lamont would be
fired. Some players lashed out at
management, claiming that the mat-
ter should not have reached the

Giving me one less day to give my

poise and confidence,” Davis said’.
“You can’t trick him and he does not
make many mistakes.”

. Temple trying to prepare for

Virginia Tech
.How do you get ready to face
one of the most versatile quarter-

backs in college football? Temple-

coach Bobby Wallace said it is going
to be a challenge trying to stop
Virginia Tech’s Michael Vick.
“Michael Vick is the best player
I have ever seen in my 22 years in
football,” Wallace said. “He is better
than Bo Jackson just because he has
the ball on every play. He is a great

running back at the quarterback-

position, and he can throw the ball, .

too.” A

Many people. are wondering
whether Temple can pull offanother
upset of Virginia Tech, like it did
two years ago. If that happens,__ it
may be with a new starting quarter-
back after Mike Frost nearly brought
the Owls back in the fourth quarter
last week against West Virginia.

“We needed a spark last week,
and Mike Frost gave us that,”
Wallace said. “We will evaluate him
during the week and decide then.”

Injuries slowing down Boston _
College

After last‘ week’s loss to Virginia
Tech,‘ Boston College coach Tom
O’Brien was disappointed with the
position his team is in.

“We are not where I thought we
would be at the beginning of this
season,” O’Brien said. “We are way
behind because of so many injuries.
We have had eight knee injuries this
year, most of them on the defense to
guys we couldn’t afford to lose.”

Two of those injuries were to
running back Cedric Washington
and cornerback Johnathan Ordway.

Washington had an MRI that showed

there was no structural damage to
his knee. He has two bone bruises.

said he didn’t know much about this
week’s opponent, Idaho. Now he
knows that they are to be taken seri-
ously.

— “Idaho is a better team than its
record suggests,” Nehlen said. “You

against Washington and Oregon, ,

which are two great teams.”

“This is a scarygame,” Nehlen

“He still has a problem with

Scarlet Knights looking forward
to week off ‘

Rutgers coach Terry Shea plans
on using this week’s bye to collect

the .team’s health and change its atti-

tude after a three-game losing

streak. Last week was alsotough for ,
coa'ch Shea because of the death of -

his mother. , '

“It really puts the "game in per-
spective,” Shea said. “Coaching can
absorb your entire existence.”

One of the main issues is to get

quarterback Mike McMahon healthy‘
and back on the field. McMahon has .

been bothered by an injury to his
shoulder. He should" be ready to play
after a week of rest.

. “McMahon will rest most of the
week and will do somethrowing by

S the end of the week and should be

ready by Sunday,” Shea said.

Syracuse will stick to its game

In last. week’s ‘win against

He could have more easily

‘ blamed Chad Hermansen or Aramis

Ramirez. Together with second-year
pitcher Kris Benson, these two
young prospects were considered to
be the hope of the Pirate-s season.

Unfortunately, both , were
shipped off to ‘Nashville, the Pirates’

vminor league affiliate.
Pat . Meares did _ not help

Lamont’.s -cause, either. The multi— '

million dollar shortstop hit .240 in

;462 at—bats. He also led the team. 

with 20 errors.

To fully appreciate. Meares’ —
incompetence, consider that utility_

infielder Mike’ Benjamin, who ' is
more known for his defensive abili-

ties rather thanhise bat, finished the ‘
. ‘season with a batting average 30

points higher than Meares. _
The Pirates had their bright

’ spots, too, most notably in Jason t

Kendall, Brian Gilesand Kris
Benson. ‘

While these players were all
expectedjto play well, a pleasant
surprisevwas Adrian Brown, the

speedy outfielder who tied Giles for ‘ ‘

second in teamibatting average with
a-.315 clip, behind only Kendall.

A But the majority of the surprises
for the Pirates this year were nega-
tive, and they cost Lamont his job.

‘ McClatchy and general manager
Cam Bonifay will be pressed to find
a new skipper to helm the Pirate
ship. Among the candidates being
considered forthe job are current
third-base coach Trent Iewett and
hitting instructor Lloyd McClendon.

Neither have any major-league man-

agerial experience. <

Jewett isfa legitimate choice. He

has gained the reputation of a wise,

’young baseball mind by coaching

Nashville and was promoted during
the middle of this season.

McClendon,- on the other hand, i
V should be dropped from considera-

tion before the search even begins.
He had been the batting coach

, .for the pastfour seasons, all losing
ones in which the Bucs’ inability to

hit the ball has been a major factor.

_ But realistically, the Pirates
. should get someone who has a track
record of winning. This is supposed

to be the end of a five-year rebuild-

ing program, so the ‘team simply"

cannot afford _to take the risk of an
untested’ manager.
And whoever’ the new manager

T is, let us hope thathe is half as

classy. as Gene Lamont is.
And for his ‘ sake, hopefully

Lamont will find _m'ajor-league .
