Win overstate Could Bring
Cats Lambert Grid Trophy 

By WILL HLIVKO , ‘ ,

Tomorrow’s ‘clash iwith the Nittany Lions of Penn State may
mean more than a bid to the Orange Bowl for Coach Red Dawson’s
Panthers, providing the outcome of their performance is successful.
A win for the Panthers possibly could bring the Lambert Trophy,

symbolic of Eastern grid’ supre-
macy, back to Pitt after an ab-
sence of 15 years. The last, time
the coveted award was in the
hands of the Panther was in 1937-.

Officially Opens

By ELINORE STONE .
A  bit of the dignity and
soberness of England’s House
of Commons has been recreat-
ed. here at Pitt.
~ Tonight the’University will
oﬁicially admit the,‘English ‘Room
to ‘its’ widening circle of Nation-
ality Classrooms around the great
-Commons Room.

'~_Her Royal Highness, Queen
Mary of England, has sent a\mes-
sage to the school wishing success
to the “ideals to which the English
Room isbeing dedicated” and say-
ing that the project “should make
..a dfeﬁnite contribution to the un-
derstanding between our two na-
tio_ns.”,

» The elaborate dedication, which
T begins’ at 8:30 p.m. in the Com-
‘T ‘mons Room, and then moves to the
vnew classroom,- will feature the
A ‘presentation of the symbols of the
roor,_n—-the King James Version of
' the ‘Bible, the Magna Carta and the
-. Philosophiae Naturalis Principia
Mathematica; the hanging of glass
‘medallions in the windows and the
 marking of the stone from No. 10
Downing Street.
The simply designed room is,
 essence, a reproduction of the
_House of Commons. In the words
of Mr. Francis Pray, public rela-
T tions counselor for Pitt, “com-
- ing into the room is like taking ‘
a trip‘350 years back into his-
tory.” 1

Gifts from England’s bombed

the spacious room. The ﬁreplace,
tiles and linenfold paneling of the
front wall are among the materials
rescued from the House of Com-
mons in 1941 and presented to the
University two and a half years
ago.

dispatch boxes, symbols of’ﬂ3ritish‘
officialdom and sovereignty, add a
touch of color to the surroundings.
Plans for furnishing the English
Room call for furniture like that
of the old House of Commons. Oak
benches on three sides of the room,’
with tablet arms for writing, will‘
face the center. -

The snow man is formed, and
when a hat is put on Frosty, it has
a magical effect and he starts to
dance and run. T T

Fire Batons Scheduled T

When Frosty sees the sun com-

ing out, his grin changes to a

‘frown. The sun is represented by

drum'majors Don Jackson and Bill
DeLuca twirling ﬁre batons.

Frosty sighs andisays, “I’ll be
back,” as music to Jingle Bells is
played. He slowly drifts from his
head down; the men_ end up. on
their knees and Frostyidisappears.

Coal Scuttle Presented
« Band announcer Jack Davey will
plug the sale of Christmas Seals

which begins tomorrow, at the end.
of the show. Final formation is the '

_’Beffore‘ graduating, all students
under the British educational pro-
gram must take a matriculation
exam lasting two weeks and pass
if they hope to enter college. Juan
passed of _ course and “decided to
come to Pitt to continue .his
studies, mainly because he has_.an

uncle, Mr..Bliss, instructor in his-
tory, on the University faculty.

Not sure of what‘ to expect in
America, Juan was and still is a
bitpuzzled. The little things be-
wilder him most. For example, he
ﬁnds it hard to get used ‘to drop-
ping money in . fare boxes on
streetcarsor eating cafeteria style.

People Make The Place

Beginning to feel at_home now,
however, Juan says that “the main
thing is I like the people, and‘peo-

_ South_ Africa is actually not such
a far cry from this “place” Amer-

People there use American cars
and smoke Lucky Strikes‘ and

Trattner Defeated  Vogel
In Last Tuesday’s Election
For Men’s Council Position

Joe Trattner was defeated Tuesday in his bid for a Men’s"

Council sophomore position,

PITT NEWS—Pag I

A gallery of spectators witnessed the controversial elec-
tion at the biggest turnout of council this semester.

to be apolitical freak, saw Julius
Vogel, who is virtuallytunknown,
defeat Trattner, who is considered
by some to be a power on campus.

. Bible Phrase ’

S t e v e Passamaneck stepped
forth to nominate Trattner and
rap student politics. He said “pa-
tronage is no good.” Then‘ using 3
parody on the ﬁrst psalm he con-
tinued, “Happy is the man who
hathwalked not in the council of
IF, nor stood in the way of healthy
-student government, nor sat in
the seat of a political dynasty . . .”

This brought down "the gavel in
the hand of Donald Ecker, presi-
dent _of MC, for Passamaneck to
observe the two and one half min-
ute time limit alloted to nomina-
tion speeches. , ‘

Goldstein Helps

However M o rt 0 n Goldstein,
vice—president of council, took
over where Passamaneck left off
and said, “Ability no longer seems
to, be the criterion for a job on
‘Men’s Council.” He refered to
the number of activities Trattner
had amassed and called for his
election.

Trattner supporters since Gold-
stein had nominated both victori-
ous candidates for council this se-
mester, Allan Robbins and __John
Micholein.

But Vogel’s block was not to be
outdone by the Trattner cheering
section; John Wallhausser, MC
secretary, said “Buz— Vogel is lost
in all these politics but though he
was a member of IF council for
only a few weeks he was elected
treasurer of that group. He obvi-
ously has something on the ball.”
'- Then leaving the election issue
for a moment he said, “I don’t
know who has lost more prestige
this "week, Men’s Council or Stu-
dent Congress.”

Vogel’s nomination was second-

- By Tim Kovor

WSGA doesn’t mean Women Sure‘ Give‘ All,

but it might as Well.

.The group of women whopmake up the govern-
ing body for the coed faction of the University
"have a system of operation that makes Student
‘Congress and Men’s Council look sick. I
, Perhaps WSGA is not required to make such
' momentous ‘decisions as deter— ’ ‘

mining who is to blame for the
failure of a pep rally or whether
the Pitt News is biased, but as

- . a governinghbody, they combine

their knowledge of legislature

. with that insurmountable “wom-

en’s touch” to form-an efficient,
spirited group.

To sit in on‘ one of_ their

meetings is not only instructive

but downright pleasurable. e’Il‘n the ﬁrst place, they
start off with an inexpensive meal prepared by
one of the coed groups in the 12th.ﬂoor kitchen.
The"meal is" light but good and informality of
letting loose over a hot stove is ideal preparation
for the coming meeting. Thewomen. also handle
the. K.P. duty when the dinner issover.

They'll Make’ Good Wives. Too 
V By cooking.their own meal from food- on hand
in the kitchen, they not only cut individual ex-
penses but also train’ for their role as the future
’ . home-makers‘—a phase of college education that
is particularly stressed in. all their activities.
The meeting itself can best be described by a
few apt adjectives: informal, constructiveghomey, ers.
eﬂicient, spirited, and spontaneous. Strict parlia-
mentary proceedureis not adhered to because it
is not needed. Prexy Adele Ma_rracin_i has no
gaveland —needs none. Reports are given, remarks '\
are heard, and‘ thediscussion is spirited but order-
ly. The hoarse-voieed‘ comments and bitter dis-.
cussions foundin MC and SC meetings are con-
sspicuous by their absence in WSGA. When'opin-

floor is desired, the coed gets -it by the simple
process of raising her hand. '
lnformality Does H-
Part of the success of WSGA could be attribut-
-ed to the informality and spirit of the members.-
Traditionally, women are supposed to be able to _,
think, talk, and listen while their hands are en- ‘
gaged in a rapid-ﬁre “knitone purl two” on a_
pair of argyle socks. Threeof the members were
thus’ engaged but managed to participate intelli-
gently and actively in the meeting. v _
Committee ‘reports are short and to the point  3
but usually ‘wind up with an appreciatory comment
for the aides and generally some humorous remark
—something rare in the «male legislatures. The in3- ..
ternal groups express‘ an actual interest in their: _
work rather than a desire for personal recognition-.
for an accomplished task. “Gung,Ho” seems to be"
the unwritten slogan.
Hostility and cattiness,‘ cliques and -factions,
have no place in the course of the meeting. The
repartee -and banter that bounces around. among
the. women is unusual in a legislative body, but.
here it adds a touch of ﬂavor -to the serious and
intelligent work being’ done. ' ‘
Not Perfect.,B-uf An Example  y .
The impression this column is trying to corio  
vey is not that WSGA has the ideal situation.‘ V‘.
They have their faults and they know, it; but they -' .3

under efficient management by competent lead-5
If men desire to\continue their so-called" su-
periority over the “weaker sex,” they had best obo _
serve -the feminine element at work and prepare '
to meet them on even terms. _ .

Customs-Guild Party
Set for November 25

WSGA’s annual Customs-Guild Party will be held next
Tuesday, Nov. 25, from 4 to 6 p.m. on the twelfth floor.

This party mafks the end of the mentor training period
for freshman women, and the beginning of their participa-

tionlin guilds which will intro—¢

duce them to established organi-
zations and activities on campus.

Customs Committee, under the
chairmanship of Bernice Sirota.
will provide entertainment at the

affair. Guild Advisor Joanne
Loutitt is in charge of decorations.

At the party each freshman
will be given a nametag bearing
the symbol of the guild to which
-she has been assigned-. The guilds
will then assemble and meet their
advisors, upperclass women who
are active in those activities which
the guild-s represent.

The ten guilds and their advis-
ors are: Choral, Suzanne Janos;
Heinz Chapel Hostess, Teddi Kr-
vanitas; Nationality Room Hostess,
Bea Paul; Owl Dorrie Secor; Pitt
News, Joan Houston; Pitt Play-
ers, Hazel Hallam; Twelfth Floor
Hostess, Nancy Creasy; Women’s
Recreation, Mary Jane Ruminski;
Women’s Speech, Ann Prisuta, and
YMCA, Linda Lofstrom.

All women students are invited
to attend this party. Tickets are
on sale for fifty cents on the
twelfth ﬂoor. '

Library Ain’t
What It’s Booked
Up To Be

A If the library had all the books
it doesn’t have, but is supposed
to have, it would really have
something.

According to Irene Karakis,
ﬁfth ﬂoor librarian, over 205
books “are now overdue. About
42 are one week late, 63 are two
weeks overtime, and approxi-
mately 100 have been “overdue”
for years.

Students give novel excuses
for their failures to bring books
back. They burn them, lend
them to other people, lose them
and get them stolen.

One boy complained that he
was leaning on the railing of a
bridge watching the water be-
neath, when the book fell in.
That, it must be admitted, is a
ﬁshy story, but the best of the
“current” crop.

A marshall’s job is not a hap-

This was the case last ‘Mon-_

shall, and asked how to get to
the roof of the building.

“You can’t go up there, son-

as high as anyone could go.

The boy’s face fell. He lived

The appeal is directed to both students and faculty.
Either used or new clothing will be" accepted, but children’s

clothing and shoes for persons 013*

when over 200 pounds of cloth-

Lita deVeyra, Pitt Y-cabinet

Pittsburgh committee to organize
the drive on the Tech, PCW and

city-wide appeal on the college
campuses.

Harriers Decline-NCAA Meet

Coach Carl Olson -has decided not to send
the Pitt cross country team to the NCAA
Championships in East Lansing, Mich. next
Monday because “it will keep them away

from their studies.”
The‘ Blue-and-Gold

in New York last Monday besides
four other out-of—town dual meets
during the season_andV have con-
sequently, missed quite a few days‘
of_school. _ ,

Olson feels the squad has spent’
enough time away from their
studies and .will not bother with
the NCAA. As far as he is ‘con-
cerned, the IC4A’s -in which Pitt
ended six.th,was theﬂimportant na-
tional meet for the Panthers and
not the NCAA. ' —

AMA ,Meet Last

Pitt did not attend’-the NCAA
meet in 1950 but at that time the
Panthers hadn’t made a good
showing in the IC4A’s and there-
fore did not travel to East‘ Lans-

Instead, the team will close ‘its
season with the Senior Allegheny
Mountain Association meet tomor-
row at Schenley Park at 11 a.m.

Last! year the Panthers easily‘
swept the Senior AMA, Bernie
Luterancik being the individual
winner, and they will be favorites
to repeat in tomorrow’s contest.

Luterancik Fades

The meet will also mark the
last time Captain Luterancik
wears the familiar Blue-and—G0ld
of the harriers. He has been the
Panthers most "consistent runner
this past year and the only grad-
uating member of the squad.»

ThetPanthers will be running
over their. four—mile home course
in competition for the ﬁrst time
since thepOct. 15 match with Slip-

and jayveeteams will race.

From" A Redhead
To Another  

By Bolus WEINS'I‘EIN'

 

Sports Editor:

  

Redheads aren’t at a premium here. Pitt has two of
them in its athletic brotherhood—Red Dawson and Red
Carlson. But the degree by which their tactics differ, how-
ever, is much greater than the‘ contrast in their shrinking
pompadours. - < ‘
Daws'on’s hair matches pleasantly with the rustic autumn
shades and Carlson’s topper tends to favor a winter weather
forecast—-snowy and white. --  - - -W
Their woes of gallant war-
riors off to battle contrast even
more, but the end result is about
the same. Carlson is famous for
his perennial “win ’em all” pre-
dictions. The calibre of material
doesn’t alter his -words. “They’ll ‘
still win ’em all—until they lose,”
he informs with a smile of satis-

What does Dawson say,
though? Well, he’s been in-
forming us for. two months of‘
his gridders activities using
the same phrase _as his pro-
position. The’ darn phrase
has brought results, so may-
_be ‘when the redhead repeats
that f‘his boys are working
on their ‘oifense and defense” ' _
it’stjust his way of saying “win ’em all——1intil they lose.”

_ It’s t‘ not a pessimisticiattitude, but at the same’ time it hides
much of ,D_a’.wson"s football knowledge and more speciﬁcally his keen
judgment of his proteges. .

t Earlier in the year Dawson let it be known that by no means
"was" he shooting for a national title or bowl contender. But did
he. really believe that he didn’t have one in his surprising Panthers?

I

-Maybe his message to Pitt followers actuallywas that “I think we

can win ’em all” attitude that the other redhead often speaks about.
Like many other coaches, Dawson feels a strong sense of
duty toward his players.» He’s not a “mingler” but his rela-‘
tions‘ with them are honest. An incident occurred during last
Saturday’s game that reflects his stand that coaches have a
‘dutyiof honest toward their boys. -
Dawson greeted one _of the Panther_regulars after his term of
service had expired. “You disappointed me out there today,” he
said, “but, let’s forget about it.” A ‘
