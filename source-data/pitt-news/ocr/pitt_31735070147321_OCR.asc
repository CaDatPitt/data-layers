2011 Board sworn into office

2011 Student Government Board President Molly Stieber gives her inauguraladdress during the ceremony last night.

Assistant News Editor

Shull is out. Stieber is in.

Responsibility for more than
$2 million from the Student Ac-
tivities Fund changed hands last
night in the Lower Lounge of the
William Pitt Union as president
Molly Stieber and the 2011 Stu-
dent Government Board took their
oaths of ofﬁce. ,

Chancellor Mark Nordenberg
and a handful of other Pitt admin-
istrators attended the cordial SGB

inauguration ceremony, along with
about 100 of the new Board’s fam-
ily and friends. Former elections
chair Lena Wickenden made open-
ing remarks around 6 p.m., and
by 6:24 Pittis undergraduate body
had nine new student leaders who
promised to bring further green

innovations and other projects to '

campus.

Nordenberg made a brief
speech after Wickenden, congratu-
latingthe 2010 Board on a job well
done and inviting the new Board to
work hand in hand with the Uni-
versity administration during the

coming year. _
“If snow is ﬂying and it’s the
ﬁrst week of January, it’s a pretty

‘good chance it’s SGB inauguration

night,” Nordenberg said to laugh-
ter and applause. “First and fore-
most, I want to thank the outgoing
board for its efforts to enrich the
lives of the some 17,000 thousand
students here at Pitt. I also want
the new Board to know that we are
prepared to work with you towards
a tremendous new year.”

During his speech, the chan-
cellor took time to commend the
outgoing Board on a number of

   

key accomplishments, including
launching a student civic engage-
ment month and registering al-
most 3,000 new student voters.
“For 15 years, I’ve been preach-
ing that student voter registration
is among our biggest concerns as a
University, and this Board has done
as much as anyone else to ensure
that Pitt students’ voices are heard
in the civic process,” Nordenberg
said. “I’m certain that Molly and
her colleagues will work to leave
the University a better place than
it was when they arrived.”

Ask students how they feel”

about the current state of Pitt
football and many will give you
the same response: they hang
their heads low, shaking them

‘ back and forth before .reluc-
tantly talking about it. It hurts
for students. ' «

“I think that most boys, and
increasingly. girls, use sports as
a way to tell a story about who
they‘ are,” said Robert Ruck, a
Pitt senior lecturer whose fields
include sports history and Pitts-
burgh history. _ ‘

Although Pitt students aren’t
on -the football roster, Ruck said
that students also experience
the painiand frustration that the
football team is experiencing at
this time, to a certain degree.

Pitt hired Miami University
of Ohio head coach Michael'Hay-
wood to replace Dave Wannstedt
in early December. About two
weeks later, it fired the coach
after he was arrested on a do-
mestic battery charge, to which
he later pleaded no.t guilty.

Ruckvsaid the incident can
be particularly painful for stu-
dents because people, regard-
less of whether they’re athletes,

tend to use sports to shape their

identity.

He described two ways that
people use sports to describe
who they are. They create a
sense of identity internally to

A Board member is sworn in during last night’s ceremony.

. N ordenberg also mentioned the forma-
tion of the Pittsburgh Student Government
Council, the establishment of the Green Fund
and the expansion of eBook options in the
Book Center as other signiﬁcant victories
for the outgoing Board. '

Outgoing Board members include Zacha-
ry Bombatch, David Gau,John Hasley, Kieran

» O’Leary, Laura Paiewonsky, David Petrone,
Sam Rezaeian and Stieber.
Board memberjohn Hasley was the only
2010 Board member re-elected in Novem-
~ ber. He will serve this term with new Board
members Ryan Gayman, Emily Hoover, Lau-
ren_]entleson,James Landreneau, Matthew
Riehle, Zach Weber and Alex Zimmerman.

During his farewell address, former
president Charlie Shull shared three pieces
of advice with the new Board. He said his
experiences with the Board show it is vital to
“ﬁnd direction early, exercise your resources
and remember to have fun.”

“Above all else I ask you all to always put
the students of this great University ﬁrst,”
Shull said.

Shull also offered a piece of advice to all
those who attended the formal ceremony:
“Help your Board.”

“I know these new Board members will

’ pour their hearts and souls into their work,

Green projects, phone app among Board’s plans

.SG(1”

and I know how important it is that they have
support from all of you during the tough
times,” Shull said. ‘

Shull then swore in Stieber as the new
Board president, who then swore in the new
Board members and made her inaugural
address. _

“Those of you who know me know that
I’m not often at a loss for words,” Stieber
said. “But trying to express my love for Pitt
into words is always diﬂicult.”

Stieber said she is extremely proud of the
work accomplished by the 2o1o,Board, but
that she hopes this year will prove to be the
most productive SGB year yet.

Chief among Stieber and the new Board’s
campaign promises include pledges to in-
crease the number of classes that fulﬁll
general education requirements, further
expansion andimprovement of the Univer-
sity Book Center and the publication of the
results of teacher evaluation surveys.

Other Board members promised to bring
technological advances to Pitt, including
smartphone applications for access to Pitt
shuttle schedules and locations.

The Board’s ﬁrst public meeting will take
place next Tuesday in Nordy’s Place beneath
the William Pitt Union. E

ate an identity to build social status.

. “Sport creates a sense of community ‘

that transcends class, race, religion,
gender, nationality, at least temporar-
ily,” Ruck said. “That’s more the case
in Pittsburgh. I don’t think there is any
other city that is more invested in a sport
than Pittsburgh.” - A
Ruck said the Pittsburgh community

is the best example‘ of a group of _indi-»

viduals who have developed an identity
around sports. .

Pittsburgh went from a city known for
its steel to a city known for its sports.
When the steel industry collapsed and
tough economic times ensued in the
1970s and 80s, the city’s sports team
continued to thrive. '

The Pittsburgh Pirates won two World
Series, the Pittsburgh Steelers won six
Super Bowls and the Pittsburgh Panthers
won a football National Championship in
the 19,765. The successllead to the popular
nickname “City of Champions.”

Ruck said that society is moving to-
ward an era where people spend more
time alone. But sports is a way to bring
back a sense of bonding. »

“Think about the bonding and‘cama-

raderie,” Ruck said. “The best way to
do that, I think, is when you are on a
team and you are the participant. The
second best thing is when you are root-
ing for a team of people you know and
care about.”

He said this is why he prefers college

“Unfortunately, they live in a fish-

do is not.”*

Freshman Anne Faust said that it’s
important for coaches to uphold high
standards in their position.

“The coach has to set an example for

_the players,” Faust said.
Mike Mayrosh, a sophomore who sat.
in the basement of the William Pitt Union ,

Thursday, said he hoped the incident
won’t give Pitt a bad name.

Even in light of the coaching ﬁasco,
students like junior Kristine Gulla said
that they would still attend the games
next season. V

Pitt spokesman E.]. Borghetti believes
many students share that attitude. -

“Students have been turning out for
Pittlsporting events in record numbers
over the past several years. Heinz Field

I attorney working on the case.

Pennsylvania has 90 days from the iden-

tity hearing to issue a governor’s warrant .

to extradite Akan to Pittsburgh for a trial,
she said.” "

The Allegheny County District Attorney’s
office is seeking that warrant from the gov-A
ernor’s ofﬁce to extradite Akan, spokesman
Mike Manko said. V 3

Joseph Dane, Akan’s attorney, said he
advised Akan not to waive hi’s rightto an
identity hearing, as Akan’s identity would be
an issue given the charges against him.

Dane said that he represented Akan only
for the extradition process and could not
comment on the underlying charges. Dane
said that~Akan’s family was looking into
securing representation for him in Pitts-
burgh. Akan’s family could not be reached
for comment. . ’

' A female Pitt student reported to police
on Sept. 12 that she had been sexually as-
saulted by a man who entered her bedroom
in a house on the 3300 block of Parkview
Avenue early that morning, police spokes-
woman Diane Richard said.

The victim told police that the sound
of footsteps coming up the stairs woke her
at 5 a.m., Richard said. The victim said an

unknown mantold her not to make any,

noise, under risk of bodily harm. _
The victim’s roommate heard noises and

called to check up on her, according to police I

reports. The victimjfearing for her life,
replied that she was O.K., Richard said.

The man then sexually assaulted the vic-
tim, leaving at about 7 am. Other room-
mates were not harmed. .

Police set up a perimeter to catch the
suspect but were unsuccessful.

Richard said the man entered the resi-
dence through a lower front window. The
window had a broken lock. /

Police ﬁrst spoke to Akan ﬁve days af-
ter the incident on Parkview Avenue_, Pitt
spokesmanjohn Fedele said. Police stopped

_ and questioned him as he exited a car parked

on Bates Street. During the interview, Akan
asked one of the ofﬁcers for a cigarette. Po-
lice asked him several questions, and he was
not arrested at that time. Akan dropped the
cigarette on the ground before leaving.
Fedele said that police took that cigarette
and sent it to the Allegheny County Crime

Lab, where the DNA was matched to DNA ~

taken from the crime scene. \-
On Nov. 30, Allegheny County issued

an arrest warrant for Akan. Thirteen days

later, Costa Mesa police and U.S._ Marshals

cooperated to arrest Akan in Orange ‘County,

Butler said. ‘

animals have been found dead in

Texas. Among washed-up drum fish

According to the San Francisco

blamed his arrest on former Black
Sabbath singer Ozzy Osbourne. But

Family life

A 91-year-old Pennsylvania wom-
an will finally have the dead bodies
of relatives returned to her property
after authorities took them away,
according to the Associated Press.
Having them dug up shortly after
they died, the woman had stored her
dead husband on a couch in the ga-
rage and her sister in a spare room.
The county coroner will return the
bodies to the property once a mau-
soleum is built. In light of this story,
we would like to redeﬁne the phrase,
“house of the living dead.”

Looking ahead

This week, The New York Times
reported that a highly criticized re-
search paper suggesting evidence for
extrasensory perception is about to
be published in a respected psychol-
ogy journal. To prove extrasensory
perception, or ESP, an emeritus
professor at Cornell tested partici-
pants’ abilities to “sense” random
events. Even without claiming to
wield ESP, we at The Pitt News can
reliably “sense” that today’s classes
will experience the highest atten-
dance rate_of any school day until
just before midterms.

Listen before judging

Liz Navratil
Editor in Chief

As the last few days have passed, the conversa-
tion surrounding former football head coach
Michael Haywood has changed.

No longer is he referred to as “the man ac-
cused of domestic battery.” Instead, I’ve over-
heard people around campus consistently refer
to Haywood, who pleaded not guilty earlier this
week, -as “the man who beat his baby’s mama,”
“another kind of disciplinarian,” or some varia-
tion on thosephrases. ‘

It seems that people have forgotten that
Haywood has not been convicted — he’s only
been charged, or accused.

In this there is a lesson. We pride ourselves
on living in a country where the press enjoys
relative freedom and ideally exposes us to the
great evils of society — everyone’s heard of

» Watergate or the Pentagon Papers.

But in our idealism, we . have abandoned
skepticism. This is a particularly dangerous
idea, because the American press is not as free
as it seems.]ournalists, like other citizens, are
bound by the law. -

When it comes td reporting on crime, jour-
nalists are generally protected from costly libel
lawsuits only when they report from a speciﬁc
handful of sources: police reports and court
documents or testimony.

The fair report privilege guarantees that

journalists can write about anythingin a police
report if they do so accurately and in a fair and
balanced manner.

But a police report — often the ﬁrst docu-
ment journalists use to break news — only con-
tains an account as reported by the responding
officers. These documents are not conclusions
in a legal sense. V

To offer a differing account of events, jour-
nalists must have ahandﬁil of sources conﬁrm-
ing the other sides of the story. This, however,
becomes virtually impossible when lawyers tell
their clients to shut their mouths or risk jail.

“Any statement that you make can be used
against you,” said Whitney Hughes, director
of Lawyer Referral Services at the Allegheny
County Bar Association. “Those statements
are going to come back to haunt you. It’s some-
thing that’s ingrained in you from the day you

. start.”

And even if journalists can speak to the

’ person accused of a crime or to their lawyer,

there’s no guarantee theywill be able to print the
materialjust because a reporter “gets the quote
right,” doesn’t mean they will be protected if
they print libelous material.

Thus, it becomes virtually impossible to
obtain the defendants side of a story, beyond
what is mentioned in the police report.

Haywood could not be reached for comment
and his attorney, Andre Gammage, understand-
ably declined to comment.

. . \ : . « 4 .

It’s important, however, to hold off on judg-
ment until the entire legal process unfolds.

Cynics might easily ask why they should
reserve judgment when the police report said
ofﬁcers noted that the mother of Haywood’s
21-month—old son had “dark red marks on her
neck and lower face/jaw area, a small raised
mark on her back and redness on her lower
right arm” and that the marks the officer found
on herwere “consistent” with the woman’s story

that Haywood had placed herin a chokehold.

For those cynics, I offer a few anecdotes.

I spent this past summer interning for The
Plain Dealer, the daily newspaper in Cleve-
land.

While there, I covered a story about a man
named Christopher Lathan.

Lathan’s brother, postal worker Robert La-
thanJr., went missing injanuary 2010 andwas
found dead several days later by a volunteer
search and rescue crew hired by the Lathan
family.

' Seven months later, police arrested Chris- A

topher Lathan for involuntary manslaughter
and obstructing justice.

Christopher was involved in a car accident
the day his brother went missing. The police
report said that oﬂicers did not see Robert at
the time of the crash, and Christopher made
no mention ofhim. Thatwas easy toreport im-
mediately as the police report was a protected
document. ‘

What took far longer — several hours (and
I was lucky it didn’t take days) — was tracking
down Christopher’s relatives, who, aside from
a lawyer, were the only ones we could seek for
comment when Lathan was in jail.

His relatives were infuriated. Christopher’s
wife, Tonya Swift, spoke to other news outlets.
I spoke "to his brother-in-law, who said that
Lathan told police Robert had been in the car
with him. It was only because both of these
sources spoke to the media that I was able to
tell that side of the story at all.

~ The media spent the next week asking local
law enforcement ofﬁcials for more details about
the case. One week later, acityjudge dismissed
the charges against Lathan. A man who could
have easily been viewed as a liar and an acci-
dental murderer was instantly seen as innocent
by most people. . ~

Need another example of someone treat-
ed as if they were guilty and then found not
guilty? H

’ The Associated Press reported Tuesday that
a Texas man who spent 30 years in prison for
rape and robbery was declared innocent after
DNA evidence exonerated him.

I’m not saying Haywood’s innocent. I’m not
saying he’s guilty. The point is that we don’t
know.

So to Haywood and his attorney Gammage, I
say,.when you’re ready to talk and it’s convenient

to talk, we’ll be ready to listen. I hope the rest‘
of our readers will be too. I _

Resolutions not integral in pursuit of happiness

Caitlyn Christensen
Columnist

The day after Christmas, I was sit-
ting on the couch in one of my oldest
friends’ living rooms, watchingaTV
special about sandwiches.

“I can’t believe how fast it’s go-
ing,” my friend said suddenly as, on
screen, a bun was piled with eggs
and bacon.

“How fast what’s going?” I
asked.

“I mean  our lives,” she said,
and, as though on cue, the cuckoo
clock behind us indicated afternoon.
There we were, a few days before
2011. My friend and I are only a
handful of years older than we were
when we first met, but a lot of things
are different now. At least with her. "I
can’t tell whether I’ve changed that
much, but to her it probably seems
as though I have.

As I drove away from my friend’s
house later that day, I got to thinking
about the upcoming new year, new
semester and the possibility of a new
start. Again. Just like I had back in
September. Just like I had the year

. before, and the year before that.

What’s in anew year after all?
We make resolutions and break
_them. We buy a gym membership,
but realize that we’d rather sit on
our couches than climb a speciﬁc
number of steps in a room with a
bunch of other sweating human be-
ings. We resolve to quit smoking, but
a pick up a pack because the pleasure
’ of having a 10-minute smoke break
all to ourselves outweighs the fears
of death and gum decay.‘ '
How are we supposed to change
or move on when the past is always
nipping at our heels? Particularly in
January, the month named for the
two—headed god of beginnings and
fendings; one visage turned to the
future, the other to the past.
See, I consider myself the queen
of resolution. It doesn’t take a calen-
’ dar date for me to want to change.
Almost weekly I resolve to stop

spending money wasteﬁilly, get a job,-

have more  constructive weekends.
Stop seeing that one guy. Study my
French. Shape up my act, or what-
ever. .

It never really works out, or at
least everything takes much lon-
ger than I anticipate. Maybe what
is wrong is that we’re looking for

January 7, 2011 I The PittNeWs I wWw.pittneWs.eon'1

a sudden change —— or more like a
sudden improvement. We forgetthat
even if the change does happen, we
probably won’t be much happier.
And if we are happier, the change
will be incremental.

The human condition is pretty

much one of equilibrium. Our hap-
piness might momentarily increase
when we get a promotion or do well
on our exams, but after alittle while,
maybe only a day, it’s going to bal-
-ance out to where we were before.
Hopefully that’s a state of content-
ment, but judging from the number
of Americans who want to change
something in their-lives each year
— about 100 million, according to
CNN — we have a hard time being
satisﬁed with ourselves just the way
we are. ' '

So maybe this year, we should
resolve to stop striving so hard for
the next thing in our pursuit of hap-
piness. Maybe we should resolve to
stop trying to improve ourselves so
much and be content with what we
are. It’s like this David Foster Wal-
lace quote I read in his biography
“Although Of Course You End Up
Becoming Yourself”: - a

“If you can think of times in your ‘

<

life that you’ve treated people with
extraordinary decency and love, and
pure uninterested concern, just be-
cause they were valuable as human
beings. The ability to do that with
ourselves. To treat ourselves the way
we would treat a really good, pre-
cious friend. Or a tiny child of ours
that we absolutely loved more than

’ life itself. And I think it’s probably

possible to achieve that. I think part
of the job we’re here for is to learn
how to do it. I know that sounds a
little pious .5 ’

It sounds a little pious, I think,

because we’ve-been trained to think -

that loving yourself is an act of self-
ishness or vanity. But maybe the
ﬁrst step to self-improvement is
learning how to treat yourself with
“extraordinary decency” — and
sometimes that decency involves
stopping something that harms you,
orwalking away from asituation that
doesn’t make you happy. Or maybe it
involves learning to accept that you
have ﬂaws and vices, and you enjoy

them, and you don’t necessarily want V

to change them, despite popular be-
lief that you should.

Either way, I think the new year ‘

needs to stop havingthis bionic man

connotation —— that each January
we can improve ourselves drasti-
cally, make ourselvesbetter, faster,
stronger, more pure human beings.
It’s stupid. It’s a concept that leads
only to disappointment.

So this new year, I’m resolving
to stop trying to change so much.
Because change comes anyway,
whether or not you’re working to-
ward it, whether or not it’s good. I
mean, you’ve seen it already. You
graduate from high school, and one
year you come back home and you
see your best friend. ,/You siton her
couch, right where you always sat,
when she made you watch “Spice
World” and when you lamented

about how your marching band

uniforms —— shut up — made you
look chunky. Except now your friend

is talking about getting married to I

the guy she’s been living with for the
past few months, and gas prices, and
her job. You weren’t there for the big
changeflt happened while you were

away. Besides, itwasn’t tangible. You -

didn’t see it until it was sitting there
talking to you.

MOVIE REVIEW

‘King’s Speec

Liz Keeney
Staff Writer

“The King’s Speech”

Starring: Colin Firth, Geoffrey
Rush, Helena Bonham Carter
Director: Tom Hooper

Grade: A-

As an audience member re-
marked, “You 'wouldn’t think a._
movie about a speech impediment
would be interesting.” But “The
King’s Speech,” the new ﬁlm from
director Tom Hooper about King
George VI’s struggle with a stam-
mer, is surprisinglyentertaining,
combining elegant writing with
exceptional performances and an
intimate portrayal of the British
royal family.

The ﬁlm, based loosely on a
true story, begins in 1925, when
Albert, the Duke of York (Colin
Firth) and second son‘ of King
George'V, addresses the ‘crowd
gathered’ for the Empire Exhibi-
tion at Wembley Stadium. As soon

as he opens his mouth, his awk-
ward, halting stammer painfully
familiarizes the audience with
his handicap. Moving forward in
time to the mid—1930s, we follow
Albert and his wife Elizabeth, the
Duchess of York (Helena Bonham
Carter), as they seek treatment
for Albert’s disability. Eventually

they arrive at the waiting room of '

Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush), a
speechtherapist with unconven-
tional methods that offend the
stiff prince at ﬁrst, but eventually
prove effective.

Soon, Albert’s speech progress
takes a backseat to the unfold-
ing drama,within the royal fam-
ily. Albert’s older brother David
assumes the throne after the
death of their father, but it soon
becomes apparent from his ongo-
ing relationship with American
divorcee Wallis Simpson that he is
not willing to live up to the stan-

dards of British hierarchy. Albert “

Rising local

Christina Ranalli
Staﬁ‘ Writer

Twenty-something local Chris

Laufman, who makes music un- .

der the moniker Wise Blood, isn’t
what you’d call humble — with
luck, he believes, his name will
soon be ubiquitous.

“I want to be the biggest be-
cause I’m supposed to be,” Lauf-
man said.

But despite growing attention
on music blogs and a recent inter-
view with Pitchfork, details about
the musician remain scarce.

Contrarily, Laufman’s music
is unmistakable. He combines,
stretches and layers beats and
samples from previously made
sounds and songs, then adds his
own vocals on top. The result is an

‘innovative mix of head—nodding
beats and woozy, muffled harmo-
nies. The Houston-born son of

a Baptist preacher, who turned
down Juilliard music school, sat
down with The Pitt News to de-
mystify part of his life and art
after he returned from New York
City. .
TPN: What inspires you?

CL: Going to the Carnegie Mu— '

seum, like legit. That really does
inspire me, a lot. Being around
here in my environment. Also,
books on great artists. That’s what
inspires me the most. ‘
TPN: What’s your favorite

»book? ‘ -

CL: “The Violent Bear It Away”
by Flannery O’Connor.

TPN: Interesting, because you
took the name “Wise Blood” from
one of O’Connor’s books, right?

CL: Well, that was my nickname
when I was a kid. My grandpa
gave it to me. He called me-“Wise
Blood,” and I never knew it was
a book until recently. And then I
read it, and it just ﬂoored me so I

kind of had to go by that.

TPN: The book is very reli-
gious. I also read that you were a
Catholic. Does that have any inﬂu-
ence on your music?

CL: Oh yeah, completely, be-
cause I’m doing itfor God.

TPN: What were you" going to
go to Juilliard for? _

CL: Music composition, be-

‘cause I can play viola, violin,

piano — you know, all those.
TPN: Why‘ do you create the
music that youydo? l
CL: Just because I want to do
something interesting  I don’t
like to play guitar that much any-

-more. I like to try to ﬁnd better

ways to come up with music --
more interesting ways, you know?
But sometimes it’s more difﬁcult
than others.

TPN: Why do you think cre-
ating sampled music instead of
playing an instrument is more
difficult?

CL: I don’t even. know how to
explain it. Chopping up samples is
so diﬂicult and making them go to-
gether and stretching them out for

. two-and—a—half, three minutes of

a song and having transitions take
place. You have to ﬁnd something
that matches your rhythm. It’s so
difﬁcult, creating ﬂuid movement.
It’s frustratingly diﬂicult. I’m at
the point where I have to move
away from it, maybe, because it’s

‘so mind-nurnbingly frustrating.

But when you hit something great
you know it. I celebrate, but it’s
f **king diﬂicult.

TPN: What is your process for
creating your music?

CL: Basically, I just come up
with a whole idea for a_song. It’s
all based around ideas. Like inspi-
ration and ideas are the biggest
part, you know? If you just ap-
proach a song with no idea of how
you’re going to do it or what it’s
going to be like, it’ll just ﬂounder,

 Wise Bloodtalks music, ambition

and it’ll just be a bunch of parts, ,

that don’t come together. But if
you have a solid idea — an idea is,
the point. Once you have an idea,
just run with it, you know?

TPN: A lot of your lyrics seem
to be about relationships or sexual
situations. Are they about anyone
in particular? l

CL: Yeah, yeah sort of. It’s just’ I

about vague things like when I go
out at night and I see a girl that I’m
like,"‘I’m going to go home with
that girl — I’m going to charm
her and I’m going to go home with

her.” I mean that’s what:“B.I.G. -

E.G.O” is all about. That’s what the
lyrics are all about: you’re going to
need me tonight, you know? Like
these drugs are kicking in. Like
me doing drugs and completely
getting so into it and loud. It’s all_
about that. It’s all about me be-'
ing this drunken, cocky asshole.
Which is usually what I am, ex-

is then called upon to take the throne, just
at the time when his country needs an out-
spoken symbol against the growing threat
of Nazi Germany. As the movie progresses,
we follow Albert~’s transformation from
prince to king, all the while seeing him as
an eminently relatable man.

As the narrative revolves around a speech
impediment, one or two dull moments
are to_ be expected. The ﬁlm compensates,
however, by basing Prince Albert’s unlikely
ascension to the throne on his ability to
articulate _words. The combined efforts
of scriptwriter David Seidler and director
Hooper result in a clever and enthralling
rising action, weaving the personal and
public trials of Albert seamlessly together.
Unlike other movies about aristocracy,.“The
King’s Speech” doesn’t hesitate to‘*paint an
unﬂattering picture of the royal family, but
manages to do so in a way that allows audi-
ences to relate to the characters.

What really drives the ﬁlm, though, is
the talent of the actors portraying the royal
family. Helena Bonham Carter reaffirms
her acting chops as the Duchess of York,

. and Geoffrey Rush as Lionel Logue adds a

much-needed close of hilarity. But it’s Colin
Firth as Prince Albert and the eventual King
George VI who steals the show, conveying
the king’s agony over his stammerfwith a
sweet sadness. An early Oscar favorite for

this year’s best actor, Firth abandons the '

stereotypically “charming Brit” persona
that made him famous, portraying instead a
man that is simultaneously awkward, angry

A and ashamed by his inability to perform a

basic human function.
Charmingly British, “The King’s Speech”

will be a treat for Anglophiles, offering an

intimate look at the world of British aris-
tocracy and transforming its members from

MEN’S BASKETBALL

 

Panthers look to stay perfect in Big East

Fresh off a nailbiting win over Providence, Pitt is set to host a Marquette team that has had several near—miss losses this season.

q Greg Trietley
Senior Staff Writer

It has been a basketball sea-
son of “almost” for the Mar-
quette Golden Eagles. V
They almost beat No. 1 Duke
in late November, falling 82-77.
They almost upset No. 22 Gon-
zaga, but lost by three points.
They almost knocked off'No. 24

. Vanderbilt, but couldn’t prevent

the Commodores from netting
the winning basket with four
seconds to play.

“We’ve lost.four games by a
total of 14 points,” coach Buzz
Williams said after a recent win
over West Virginia. “Did we earn
the right to beat the No. 1 team
in the’ country on a neutral site?
No. Did we earn the right to beat
Gonzaga...? No.”

As a result, the Golden Eagles
(11-4, 2-0 Big East) enteredJanu—
ary without a big-time win for
their NCAA Tournament resumé,

Pitt guard Travon Woodall (No. 1) handles the ball against Riderearlier this season. Woodal

and the road ahead won’t get any M

easier when they take on No. 5
Pitt (14—1, 2-0 Big East) tomor-
row at 2 p.m. in the Petersen
Events Center.

The Panthers would be more
than happy to continue the Gold-
en Eagles’ string of tough loss-
es against ranked opponents.
The Golden Eagles defeated
West Virginia last Saturday to
open conference play, but they,

-like every Big East team, have

a daunting schedule ahead of
them in a conference with eight
ranked teams.

“It’s an.:18—mile run and we
finished one,” Williams said.

On Tuesday, the Panthers
nearly discovered the strength
of the conference the hard way,
when they trailed Providence,
76-74, With one minute to
play. But Travon Woodall hit a
3—pointer late, and Pitt escaped
with an 83-79 win. g

“It got real tense,” Pitt red-

shirt freshman Lamar Patter-

son said in a press conference

Thursday. “No one wants to
lose, especially not to Provi-
dence away. We wanted to get
that win  Now we just worry
about Marquette.”

Woodall is the most recent
case of Pitt’s different day, dif-
ferent star mentality. It’s tough
to find a weak spot in the Pan-
thers lineup as seven Panthers
now average at least sixpoints
per contest. ;

“I got in the game because
Brad [Wanamaker] fouled out,”
Woodall said Thursday. “[Head
coachjamie Dixon] called me off
the bench, and I was just ready
to go.”

Dixon’s team is second in the
nation in rebounding and first
in assists. ‘

Marquette counters Pitt’s
attack with a balanced one of
its own. Darius Johnson-Odom,
Jimmy Butler’ and Jae Crowder

all average at least 12 points

per game, and ‘freshman Vander
Blue ‘addsalmost 10 more off
the bench.  ‘

“They’re similar to Provi-
dence in that they like to attack
off the dribble, trying to ‘get to
the rim, trying to get to the foul

A line,” Dixon said-

Marquette averages 80.8
points per-game, second in the
Big East. ‘

Crowder might be the most
impressive Golden Eagle late-
ly. Last season’s junior college
player of the year had 29 points
against West Virginia on New
Year’s Day. '

' “I said about seven weeks ago
— nobody listens to me unless
we win, I understand — that he
would end up being the heart
and soul of our team,” Williams
said. “He’s such an instinctive
player.”

Crowder is the second play-
er in two years to start for the

Ryan Samson I Staff Photographer
1 hit a 3-point shot late in the game against Provi-

dence to propel the Panthers to an 83-79 victory.

Golden Eagles out of junior
college. Johnson-Odom, Mar-
quette’s leading scorer this sea-
son, joined the team last yean
out of Hutchinson Community
College.

“It’s a tough transition,”
Dixon said. “It’s very hard for a
junior college transfer to come
in, but they’ve had guys do it and‘
come in and play and be produc- A.
tive right away.”

_Iohnson—Odom had 21 points
against West Virginia and 29
more in a win over Rutgers
Wednesday night. Woodall,
though, said that the Panthers
can slow him down if they limit
his space.

“We just have to do a good job
of bottling him up and try to al-

ter his shots,” Woodall said. ‘‘We »

have to limit his touches. That’_s,,

the best way to stop a player.”
If they do that, it could be an-

other “almost” for Marquette.I

As former Pitt head coach Michael Hay-
wood said, “Recruiting is the lifeblood
of the program.” And earlier this season,
the Panthers had a highly regarded class
of 17 athletes committed to playing foot-
ball at Heinz Field. . . \
-. But many of those recruits were im-
pressed with Dave Wannstedt and, after
Wannstedt resigned under pressure in
December, the number of prospective
recruits dropped considerably from 17
to six. . _ .
Former Pitt commit Ben Kline said
that he was first attracted to Pitt because
of “the people involved.”

“Those were some of the best people 4

I’ve ever‘ met,” said Kline, a three-star
linebacker from Dallastown, Pa. “Not
just in r_ecruiting, but in general.”

Kline has since committed to Penn
State and remains solid.with that com-
mitment,

Kyshoen Jarrett, a four-star.corner-
back, has also committed to another

school, Virginia Tech.Jarrett cited Pitt’s ’

coaching staff as the reason he originally
chose the Panthers.

“Deﬁnitely the coaching‘ staff,” Jar-
rett said. “Pitt’s coaching staff was just
great.”

But when Wannstedt resigned, at least

11 players opened up their recruiting

V process agairi. ,

. The players who remain committed
to Pitt said they do so because they were
attracted to the school’s traditions, aca-
demic support and sense of family —
qualities Pitt might use to draw other
players.. . .

“I really just liked the city. It’s a great
city,” Jarrett said. “Also, the team was
really a family.” ‘

Other recruits echoed this statement
as well, such as homegrown cornerback
Lafayette Pitts.

“There’s just a family-like feel there,”
Pitts said. O .

Although Pitts reopened his recruit-.

ment, he conﬁrmed that his hometown
team is still very much in the running.

“I like the University. It’s my home-
town, and I have always felt connected
there,” Pitts said.

Fellow Woodland Hills graduate
Khaynin Mosley-Smith, who completed
a standout season at prep school Mil-
ford Academy-, is oneof the six remain-
ing committed members of this year’s
class. - .

“My ﬁrstattraction to Pitt is the tradi-
tion,” said Mosley-Smith, a four-star de-

fensive tackle. “Pitt offers so much help _

and tutoring that other schools don’t.
“Pitt will always be in the running
for me. This is my hometown — noth-

ing comes before Pitt. I will sit down
with the new head coach and have a long
conversation.”

Running backjeremiah Bryson has, at
least for the moment, kept his commit-
ment to Pitt. The tradition, as well as the
coaching staff at Pitt, wowed him.

“I was attracted to the history of it,”
Bryson said. “That, along with the chance
to play for a great coach.”

Highly touted defensive tackle Mar-

quise Wright has begun looking at other
schools, with a list of notable colleges to

choose from, including Michigan State. g

Despite his collection of offers, he initial-
ly chose Pitt because he'was impressed
with Wannstedt and the city.

“My ﬁrst attraction to Pitt was the
coaches and the campus,” Wright said.
“Pi~ttsburgh is truly an awesome place.

- Pitt offers everythingl want. It just seems

to be'too unstable right now.”

The next Pitt coach could offer the
class some stability by bringing in players
with whom he’s developed a relationship.
The Pittsburgh Post—Gazette reported
that both Penn State defensive coordina-
tor Tom Bradley and Alabama assistant
head coach for defense Sal Sunseri met
with University officials this week. Pitt

couldn’t be, reached for additional com-

ment. On Wednesday, Pitt denied rumors
that it had hired Bradley. as its new head
coach. Multiple outlets are reportingthat
he’s still in the running. I .
Bradley has spent 33 years at Penn
State,.is one of its premier recruitersand
already has a start on some of the athletes
that Pitt will seek to recruit for 2012.
One top recruit fotj 2012 is Rushel
Shell from Hopewell in_ Aliquippa, Pa.

I Shell is a potential top-10 ‘recruit na-

tionally and could have an impact much
like Terrelle Pryor, who started a string
of other high-proﬁle commitments at
Ohio State.

Shell has developed a close relation-

ship with Bradley and is still consider-

ing Pitt. .
“[Pitt is] still one of my schools just

because it’s at home,” Shell told the Post- .

Gazette. “I still have to figure out some

things and talk to the new coach there. I’ll I

see what my relationship is with him.”

Kline also offered kind words about I

Bradley.

“I really like Tom Bradley,” Kline said.
“He’s a great coach, and he’ll do really
well there [at Pitt.]” ’

Wright echoed Kline’s statement,
saying that Bradley is_ “a great guy” and
he’ll listen to what the coach has to say
if Bradley takes over at Pitt. _

Mosley-Smith, who is still committed
to Pitt, agreed. V

“Tom Bradley is a great guy and has I

good coaching background,” he said. “I
would be happy to have him as my new
head coach.” §
