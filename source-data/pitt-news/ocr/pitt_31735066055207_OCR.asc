Pitt researcher and Libertarian candidate Harold Kyriazi knows his chances
of being elected to the Pennsylvania Senate are slim. *

 

Lisa Grzyboski
Staff Writer

It’s 9:30 a.m. on one of the cold-
est Saturdays to hit Pittsburgh this
fall, and Harold Kyriazi parks his car
in an empty lot along the Boulevard
of the Allies. Another day of door-to-
door campaigning stretches ahead of
him as he looks forward to hours of
introducing himself as the
Libertarian Party candidate running
for state Senate.

He rapidly rubs his hands togeth-
er in a futile effort for warmth.
While he may fail to combat the bit-
ter cold on his morning outings,
Kyriazi feels he has done anything
but fail throughout his campaign. At
least he has people talking about his
ideas for getting the government off
the back of the common man.

Kyriazi is the first to say his.

chances at victoryare about as good
as finding a needle in a haystack.
After all, he’s running against one of
the strongest Democrats around -
Allegheny County Democratic

Chairman Leonard Bodack. But if
the votes came in on Tuesday night
in his favor?

“It would be the greatest thrill of
my life to inject some reason into
state politics,” he said.

Right now, Kyriazi feels reason
is-the last word to describe politics
in Pennsylvania or, for that matter, in
the nation.

“I think we have a tax structure
that is indirectly killing people,”
Kyriazi said, with a look of deep
concern splashed across his face.

He said it wouldn’t bother him if
the government‘ taxed privileges it
provides to the people, but the
minute it starts taxing productive
things such.as income and invest-
ments, the government has over-
stepped its bounds. .

That is why the research associ-
ate in Pitt’s neurobiology department
moonlights as the Libertarian senato-
rial candidate every chance he gets.
He hits the streets before heading off

Experts: industrialization
and waste killing the Earth

Christal Hall
Staff Wrlter

Imagine rations on the quanti-ty
of water you can use or limits on the
number of children you can have.
Restrictions such as these might
very well happen if humans contin-
ue to deplete the Earth’s resources,
according to John Holdren.

Holdren, the director of the pro-
gram on science, technology‘ and
public policy at the John F.
Kennedy School of Government,
said humans depend on the environ-
mental resources for industrial
development. '

“The continuation of ‘business
as usual’ implies bigger increases
and damages than they think,”
Holdren said.
, Ernst Ulrich von Weizsacker,
president of the Wupperthal
Institute for Climate, Environment
and Energy in the‘ North

Rhine/Wesphalian Science Center in
Germany, agreed, saying that green-
house gasses are damaging to coun-

tries like Bangladesh. Eighty per- _

cent of the country’s climate is sub-
ject to rising temperatures. ‘

Holdren and Weizsacker, two of
the world’s leading scientists in
environmental procedure and devel-
opment, spoke at the second annual
Global Integration Lecture Monday
night. They discussed what Europe
and America can do to better man-
age and control the Earth’s
resources.

The lecture, sponsored by Pitt’s
University Center for International
Studies and the World Federalist
Association of Pittsburgh, focused
on global environmental change and
also included suggestions that
would help people to use resources
more efficiently.

“The greenhouse effect is bigger
than most people think, because

humankind is more dependent on
the environment than we think,”
said Holdren. ‘

Weizsacker co-authored the
book, “Factor Four — Doubling
Wealth, Halving Resource Use”,
which explains how to quadruple
resource productivity using existing
technological knowledge.

He gave an example of how‘ peo-
ple waste resources by talking about

the tomato industry. He said toma-
toes grown in Amsterdam are
shipped to~Moscow so they can be
flown to southern New York,
because it’s cheaper to ship them
from Moscow than it is from
Amsterdam.

He said people need to stop pay-
ing attention to personal productivi-

MARK Bs FOR THE Prrr News

Former Congressman Paul Findley said President Clinton is on the right
track toward fostering peace in the Middle East.

Speakers disagree on United
States’ policy on Palestine

Dan Sauder
Senior Staff Writer

Paul Findley has spent the last 22
years representing the interests of the 7
million Muslims who live in the United
States and want to see a Palestinian
state established. He believes U.S.
intervention in the process is critical to
a positive and peaceful outcome.

“I saw the piles of bloodshed
between Israel and Palestine, and I saw
no chance of peace without intervention
from the United States,” he said.

Findley, a former Congressman and
current author, was one of two guest
lecturers who spoke at the “Israel 
Palestine  Peace Without Justice?”
program, sponsored by the Muslim
Student Association Thursday evening.

Brother Peter Matthews Wright, a
local attorney and Muslim, also spoke
at the lecture. He replaced Brother
Hatem Bazyan, who was scheduled to
speak with Findley but had to cancel at
the last minute.

Many of those in attendance stayed
after the lecture to participate in a brief
question—and—answer period with

"Findley, Wright and other members of
the MSA.

According to Findley, peace in
Palestine will only happen with the help
of the U.S. president. Bill Clinton, he
said, is on a positive track.

“It’s the first time since Jimmy
Carter a president was fully engaged,”
said Findley, referring to the Maryland
Conference on the Middle East, at
which Clinton spent considerable time
pushing for the resulting peace agree-
ment.

Findley served in the U.S. House of

Representatives from 1961-1983, as a
representative from Illinois. During that
time, he paid close attention to the
efforts of President Jimmy Carter to
achieve peace in the Middle East.

Findley said he believes very few
congressmen have spoken out about the
Middle East. He attributed his own
defeat for re-election in 1982 partially
to his views on the Middle East, which
he said were not popular with voters.

His “involuntary” departure from
U.S. government has not stopped him
from speaking out on the Middle East.
Currently, he is working on a book
titled “7 Million Muslims: America’s
Untapped Resource.” Findley is also
Chairman of the Human Relations
Commission and the Council for the
National Interest.

Wright disagreed with Findley, say-
ing U.S. ‘policy in the Middle East runs
counter to the basic principals of free-
dom that Americans fought for against
the British in colonial times. For
instance, the Israelis often restrict
Palestinians’ access to the West Bank,
and Wright said U.S. policy favors the
Israelis.

“Things that we found violative of
basic human rights we now have no
problem with in other countries,” said
Wright.

Those whoporganized the event, the
MSA Council of Carnegie Mellon
University, West Virginia University
and Pitt, spoke optimistically of this
and future events. ’

“Next time we have an issue, there
is going to be an even bigger turnout,”
said Pitt’s newly elected MSA President
Rehan Aslam. “We’re just scratching
the surface.” '

to the lab in the morning, campaigns
during his lunch hour and after work,
and uses his weekends for prime-
time pamphleteering. Many times he
walks the 38th district alone, saying
it’s much more efficient. Sometimes
he takes a volunteer along, stuffing
the person in a car already ch_ock—full
of lawn signs, “Vote Harold ‘Kyriazi"’v
campaign ﬂiers, Libertarian litera-
ture and lists of registered voters for
practically everystreet in -Swissvale,
downtown Pittsburgh,-tthe -Northside,
Oakmont and all areas in between. _

« —“Harold’s honest, and he’s intel-

ligent, and¥he>s a"Libertarian,”-said V

Damon Hudac, a‘Pitt ‘senior who two

weekends ago"helped.Kyriazi dis-if

tribute about ‘l,'200 ﬂiers ‘i in
Sharpsburg and spent the better part"
of Saturday morning traversing the
streets and side alleys of South
Oakland.

Hudac knew about the
Libertarian Party for a while, but its
ideas about drug and- prostitution
legalization made him think twice
before joining.

Kyriazi said this frequently hap-
pens, but if people stop to think
about legalization it begins to make
sense. Libertarians believe people
have the right to do what they want,
when they want, provided they do it
responsibly without harming others.

“Libertarians just basically want
to be left alone to run their lives,”

‘ Kyriazi said, stressing when big gov-

ernment enters the scene, people lose
control of their lives.

He cited the county’s stadium tax
as a perfect example of government
ignoring the wishes of the people,
saying it “went right over the peo-
ple’s heads after they yoted against
It.” i

People are starting to accept
Libertarian ideas as viable, Kyriazi
said, a far cry from the days when a
mere mention of the word would
conjure images of Karl Marx, and his
brand of socialism in the minds of
everyday Pennsylvanians.  .

Pennsylvania has 3O,O00j-«voters

, registered as ‘Libertarians, andja little
more than 30 are running for office, ‘

with one on the ballot. for state. gov-
ernor against incumbent Tom Ridge.

“Harold looksat an election like
this as educational outreach,” .said
Tim Lloyd, Vice Chairman of the
Allegheny County Libertarian Party.
“Many people don’t know what the
Libertarian Party is. I think it takes
time, and right now we don’t have
the money for TV and radio spots.
Because we’re not offering ‘goodies

' to people, we’re not going to see

PPG come to give us loads of money,
because we’re not going to make
them rich.”

Despite the obstacles, Kyriazi
defiantly trudges on, moving from
house to house. It just may be the

, next sleepy porch that finds him a

supporter and a true—blood

Libertarian.

ty and start caring more about the
well—being of the planet. H

“According to my
knowledge, we only have one
Earth,” said Weizsacker.

The most serious environmental
problems in the Pittsburgh region
are air pollution, acid precipitation,
and soil erosion and deterioration,
according to Holdren. Globally, the
most serious problem is the deple-
tion of the ozone and ,the'stratos-
phere.

He said evidence of global
warming is surrounding us because
the climate is constantly changing.
The climate change is the most dan-
gerous global problem because it
affects all environmental conditions
and processes.

“Greenhouse gas-induced
warming is indeed the culprit for
the climate change,” said Holdren.

He estimated that by 2055, tem-
peratures will rise 10 to 15 degrees,
which could result in an increase of
hurricanes and typhoons.

He said scientists are uncertain
about the timing, magnitude and
regional distance of, the physical

school.

and biological impacts of the cli-
mate change.

“There’s no need for compla-
cency because uncertainties cut
both ways,” said Holdren. “It might
turn out better than the ‘central’
estimates, but it might be worse.”

Holdren said the solution is not
just environmental. He recommends
obtaining and maintaining five
other policies: economic, technolo-

..gy, population, international assis-

tance and international security.

“If we can stabilize population
to 8 billion rather than 12, we
would use less resources,” said
Holdren.

Weizsacker said the fallacy of
the environmental policy is that
states like Pennsylvania started
poor and clean, then gradually
became rich and dirty. He said once
rich people realized the harmful
effects of pollution, they cleaned up
the areas they lived in. But the poor
neighborhoods remained very dirty.

He said humans need to reduce
greenhouse emissions 50 percent to
80 percent by the middle of the next
century. .

“If we continue to use the Earth
the way we do, we’ll need four
Earths to live,” said Weizsacker.

Third party needed to liven up
stagnant lwo-party system

Voters will go to the polls today
to choose their governor, congress-
men and state representatives.
Political pundits predict most vot-
ers will be satisﬁed with the incum-
bents and return them to oﬂice.
Some are worried that voter turnout
will be the lowest ever, with the 18-
to 25-year-old age group being the
part of the voting population least
likely to go to the polls. ‘I

Republican and Democrat
apologists are more than eager to
blame apathy rather than blaming
the mediocrity of the candidates
offered by both parties. Voters in
the 18- to 25-year-old age group
are not turning out not because they
don’t care but because of the stag-
nating two-party political system.

The emergence of a strong
third party has not yet occurred, but
with the blurring of the lines
between Republican and ,
Democrat, that is likely to change
within the next 50 years. Ross
Perot came close in the 1992
Presidential election, garnering 24
percent of the vote. His eiforts
proved to smaller political parties,
particularly ﬂue Libertarian Party,
that the big two are losing ground.

In Pennsylvania, PegLuksik of
the Constitution Party is running in
the race for governor against

incumbent Tom Ridge, Democrat
challenger Ivan Itkin and
Libertarian challenger Ken
Krawchuk. Pollsters have predict-
ed she may get between seven per-
cent and 12 percent of the vote
today. Though she is hardly a desir-
able alternative to Ridge and Itkin,
the presence of a strong third party
and a fresh View can only help the
democratic process, not harm it as
strategists in the big two claim.
Those smug, complacent
Republicans and Democrats would
do well to remember that third
party candidates, while admitting
they can’t win, raise valid issues
that the big two parties won’t. For
example, last year, the late billion-
aire James Goldsmith and his
Referendum Party opened up the
debate on Britain’s future in the
European Union duringthe general

5 elections, a topic both the Labour

Party and Conservative Party
avoided.

Sooner or later, the Republican
and Democrat campaign money
train will stop, levelling the politi-
cal playing ﬁeld. A strong third
party will emerge and start winning
elections.

It’s in -America’s best interest‘

that this two-party mediocrity stops
soon.

Who 5 a
The award-winning creative talent
behind Broadway hits such as‘ “Ragtime,”
“Master Class” and “Love! Valour!
Compassionl,” Terrence McNally has estab-
lished himself as one of America’s most
important playwrights of the decade. But
none of these dramatic triumphs have earned
the author as much attention as his most
recent work, “Corpus Christi,” now playing at
the Manhattan Theatre Club in New York
City.

troversy stems from the fact that “Corpus
Christi” is a loose retelling of the New
Testament stories of Jesus — with the main
character, Joshua, portrayed as a gay man.
Not surprisingly, this dramatic work has
inspired outrage among some narrow-minded

individuals who feel that the Gospels are the
exclusive province of heterosexual readers. ,

Some of McNally’s attackers have gone so far
as to phone in bomb threats to the Manhattan

Theatre Club — a sad fact noted by Jess.
MICHAEL J.

Cagle in his review in the Oct. 23
issue of Entertainment Weekly.
Security demands made it neces-
sary for theater patrons to pass
through a metal detector before
seeing the show.

' Protestors have also picketed outside the
theater during performances. One of the
play’s most vocal critics has been Bill
Donohue, of the Catholic League for
Religious and Civil Rights —- a right-wing
organization whose deceptively positive
name belies much of its agenda.

Donohue continued his campaign against
“Corpus Christi” in an Oct. 18 appearance on
Fox News Channel’s “The 0’ Reilly Factor.”
Blasting McNally and his creative partners,
Donohue declared that “they took the scrip-
ture and perverted it.” He added, “Anyone
who defends this [play] needs to perform
some kind of -self-examination. What kind of
demons are inside you?”

It might be helpful to put Donohue’s out-
rage into some kind of historical perspective.
The fact is, both theologians and artists have
been creating “alternative Jesuses” since the
ﬁrst written accounts of him appeared. Even

the Gospel writers’ Jesuses are often at vari-

ance". ‘Whereas.Mark’s very human Jesus, in

frcrid of gay sus?

despair, cries out “My God, my God, why
hast thou forsaken me?” on the cross, John’s
metaphysical Jesus serenely declares, “It is
finished.” Does this make one writer wrong?
Of course not. Each interpreted and depicted
Jesus’ death in his unique manner.

One of the world’s most signiﬁcant alter-
native portraits of Jesus is that appearing in
the Qur’an, the holy book of Islam. This text
presents much information about Jesus that
conﬂicts with the image of him held by theo-
logically orthodox Christians. For example,
in the 61st Sura, or division, of the Qur’an, it
is written that Jesus predicted the prophet-
hood and ministry of his successor
Muharnrned. ' '

Just as some insecure “Christians” —— and
I should note, I don’t believe these folks rep-
resent the vast majority of Christians 

attack “Corpus Christi” today, so have some

Christians taken cheap shots at the Qur’an
over the centuries. In the preface to his excel-
lent 1955 English translation, “The Koran
Interpreted,” Arthur J. Arberry
quotes an example of such child-
ish invective; the introduction of a
1649 English version of the
Qur’an claimed that the holy book
of Islam was ﬁlled with “contra-
dictions, blasphernies, obscene speeches and
ridiculous fables.”

Another work of sacred literature that
offers an alternative portrait of ‘Jesus is the
Book of Mormon, a text known as the key-
stone of the Mormon religion. In this book,
ﬁrst published in 1830, the resurrected Jesus
is said to have visited the ancient peoples of
the Americas, where he established an ancient

a Christian Church. This scenario mightily dis-

pleased many Protestant Christian readers,
who saw in the Book of Mormon an attack (in
their own concept of Jesus. 
In his 1984 study, “Trouble Enough:
Joseph Smith and the Book of Mormonﬁ”
Ernest H. Taves shares a quote from one of
the Book of Mormon’s contemporary review-
ers. This critic, writing in the April 2, 1830,
edition of the Rochester Daily Adviser,
expressed an attitude toward this book similar

_ to that expressed by generations of Christians

  
    

g ‘_ continued on next page

Tursnmr, 3 Novmnrn 1998

From previous page

toward the Qur’an; he claimed that the
Mormon scripture was “a vile imposition
 an evidence of fraud, blasphemy and
credulity, shocking both to Christians and
moralists.”

I ‘am certainly not suggesting that
Protestant and Catholic Christians con-
vert to either Islam or Mormonism, nei-
ther am I suggesting that they .accept
McNally’s take on this 2,000 year old
story. What I am suggesting is that Jesus
—— as a historical ﬁgure, a‘ literary char-
acter and a spiritual icon --‘ is not the
exclusive “property” of heterosexual
Catholic and Protestant Christians. Jesus
belongs to all people, all faiths and all cul-
tures. And people will continue to create
their own alternative texts about or
inspired by Jesus. '

Bill Donohue and his fellow protes-
tors certainly have the right to picket
“Corpus Christi,” just as Catholics and
Protestants have the right to verbally
attack the Qur’an and the Book of
Mormon. But in our multicultural society,
might it not be more constructive to try to
really understand these alternative J esuses
and gain some insight into the communi-
ties that find something inspiring in these

portraits? How many Catholics and

Protestants have tried to engage their
Mormon and Muslim brothers and sisters
in a genuine interfaith dialogue? How

many heterosexual Christians have really’

LiIIey’s  
adventures in
the Dome

Syracuse, N.Y. —— Saturday, I received
a free physics lesson ﬁom the Carrier Dome.

After forgetting a fpw minor things in
the press box (statistics, ﬁnal summaries,
quotes, hotel keys and such), another writer
and I ﬂew back to the dome from the park-
ing lot, eager to ﬁnd the lost belongings,
write our stories and blow every last cent on
our expense accounts.

Going at top speed, we went through a
door labeled “Airloc ” I shoved the door
open and entered into a small room. Not
thinking about the label, the purpose of the
small room or anything else aside from get-
ting out of Syracuse as soon as possible, I
cracked open the second door and rounded
the corner into the ground—1eve1 labyrinth of
the stadium

My fellow writer vanished. People
started screaming. _

For those without a background in
advanced domed stadium design 5- a.k.a.
“Bubble-building 101” - I’ll keep the
physics basic: It has been scientiﬁcally
proven that by opening up both sides of an
airlock at a domed stadium, an overweight,
hurried sportswriter causes two things to
occur.

First, technically, he’ll compromise the
structural integrity of the building. Because
the dome is propped up by compressed air,
any leakage from the pressurized areas (i.e.
the hallways underneath the place, where
wind often whips through faster ~ than
Donovan McNabb rimning the option)
could mean disaster for the whle system

Secondly, the stadium security, force
will get very angry with whoever is standing
in the airlock when the doors are open. That
just happened to be the other writer, who
gave a sheepish grin to the 230-pound secu-
rity guard who stood at the irmer airlock
door.

I reached the elevator before realizing
that an important part of my two-man excur-
sion force was missing. When I returned to
the entrance, I saw him standing and ner-
vously smiling in the safety of the airlock
chamber.

Brieﬂy, the notion of blasting him out
into space crossed my mind, but unlike
every other airlock I’d seen on television or
in the movies, that feature - the red button
marked “Blast Guy in Airlock Out Into
Space” - wasn’t available at the Carrier
Dome.

After opening the door for the ﬁozen
freshman, the security guard began his lec-
ture about how crazy anyone would have to

 

Women's soccer loses, 2-0, to Mountaineers

Mario Machi

Staff Wrlter

The Pitt Panthers women’s soccer
team closed out the regular season on
Sunday with a loss at West Virginia.
However, this loss did not affect
the Panthers’ postseason fate, as
the team had already clinched the
number—six seed in the Big East
tournament.

It was senior day in
Morgantown, and WVU forward
Rena Lippa shined, scoring both of
the goals in the 2-0 win for the
Mountaineers. The game might
have been meaningless for Pitt, but
it was very important for WVU
because the win gave them a spot
in the conference tournament.

West Virginia controlled the
pace for most of the game, ﬁring
26 shots on goal compared to just
nine for the Panthers. However,
that doesn’t mean the Panthers
went without opportunity. Pitt had
seven comer kicks over the course
of the game, while WVU was only
able to attempt one.

The game was a tight defensive
matchup, tied for almost the entire ﬁrst

half. WVU’s Lippa capitalized in the 37th
minute of the half to put the Mountaineers
in the lead. The play started with a corner
kick from Tonia Deligiannis. Lippa headed
it past Pitt goalkeeper Nicole Bashor for the
1-0 lead. '

minute into the ﬁnal half, Lippa took a
cross right pass ﬁom Robyn D’Aversa and
blasted it in from 10 yards out to give the
Mountaineers the 2-0 lead That was all

‘ that W V U goalkeeper Stacy Adams need-

ed.

Helped by the strong defensive
play of her teammates, Adams was
only forced to make ﬁve saves. Her
toughest challenge came from
Pitt’s Cande Ruiz, who had four of
Pitt’s nine shots on goal. Bashor
ﬁnished with six saves for Pitt.

The Panthers will play Syracuse
Wednesday night in the ﬁrst round
of the Big East tournament, and
West Virginia will travel to South
Bend, Ir1d., to take on Notre Dame.
The other ﬁrst-round matchup has
Seton Hall taking on Boston
College. The top Seed in the tour-
nament is Connecticut, who will
have a bye in the ﬁrst round.

For Pitt, the only negative thing

CHRIS Tww\Es/ STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER

Charity McClure has helped lead the Panthers this year.

The rest of the half was scoreless, but
the Panthers were victimized once again by
Lippa early in the second half. Just over a

that came out of Sunday’s loss was
the fact that the team failed to ﬁn-
ish with a .500 record on the year.
The loss dropped Pitt to 8-10 over-
all, with a 5-6 mark in Big East play. West
Virginia ﬁnished the season 11-5-2, with a
4-5-2 record in the conference.

Siler and Brett Collins placed first
and second in the 1000-yard freestyle.
Pitt’s Blair Beal, Michael Wells and

In the individual medley, Michael
Pron, Will Eden and Craig Peterson
took the top spots. The relay freestyle
saw Jerry ‘Koller, Joshua Quinn, Elko
and Lupetin taking first.

The Orangemen, however, had dif-
ferent plans for the Panthers as they
dipped into Webster Pool Saturday
morning. Of » the 14 events, Pitt ‘only
placed first in three. The Orangemen
scored 133 points to Pitt’s 110.

Beal did manage to place ﬁrst in the
1 diving, followed by Anderson and

Wells. Anderson kept to his first place ’

in the 3 diving, and Beal came in sec—~
ond.

When Pitt headed off to the races,
Pron was the only Panther to break
through the sea of orange. He did it in a
big way, breaking a 15-year pool record
in the 200-yard breaststroke.

The women fareda little better than y

Walt ‘Harris is running out of

‘ options — and not those of the pitch-

out variety.

. With his running back corps
depleted, and coming off a game in
which his offense could not find a
way to score against’ Rutgers during
the second half, Harris made a des-
perate move by giving backup quar-
terback Matt O’Connor his first start
as a Panther Saturday against
Syracuse.

The result?
“Matt was not personally as ready
as he needed to be to handle the

he really didn’t know what- to
expect,” Harris said at a press confer-
ence yesterday.

O’Connor played admirably for a
little more than a quarter, adding a
touchdown to Pitt’s early 2-0 lead,
but two turnovers and offensive futil-
ity led to his early exit.

“He did really make a nice throw
that got us a touchdownthat probably
extended his time in the game, but he
has to do all the details of our offense
in order for our offensive football

V team to function,” Harris said.

 .Matt Lytle then took control
behind center and kept the score

_,close for much of the game. Harris
‘said Lytle will take all of the snaps

   
 

 

 

iormances this iseason

during this week’s practices and, for
now, has retaken the "starting role.

“He is as secure as he wants to
work to be, and prepare to be, and
execute to be,” Harris said.

On’ the motivation behind the
demotion of Lytle, Harris said,
“There were some little details that
he was not doing that I made empha-
sis on. It wasn’t winning ‘or losing
games directly that was the reason-
ing.”

He added, “I think the experience
last week of seeing someone else play
and having him not do well at times
and still staying in there,‘I think that

did a lot for our entire football pro-
gram, not just Matt Lytle.”

, Harris said he was proud of the
team’s overall effort to remain within
striking distance of the Orangemen
but was not satisfied with instances
of poor execution. '

“We just have to learn to not give
up the ball, like we gave up in that
game, we’ve got to learn to not turn
the ball over, we’ve got to learn that
the game is won by the team that
makes the fewest mistakes,” he said.

Harris found fault with many
individuals, partly due to the high
expectations he acquired as a player.

“I know when I played for Buddy
Ryan [at the University of the

Pacific], I tried to kill myself doing
the things he wanted me to do,
because I knew if I didn’t, I wouldn’t
see the field,” Harris said. “I put a lot
into» it, and I expect our players to be
exactly the same way.”

The Panthers will need to show
signs of immediate growth if they
hope to salvage the season. They will
need to play undefeated football for
the remaining four games in order to
be eligible for a bowl—game berth.
But Harris has more pressing con-
cerns, with a home contest against
the Temple - Owls, who upset the
Panthers last season 17-13.

"‘I forewarned [my players] that I
have a sour taste in my mouth with
regard to how we performed and how
we preparedfor Temple a year ago,”
Harris said. '

I wasn’t in the mood After all, the
Panthers hadjust dropped a heartbreaker to
Syracuse and while their bowl hopes
remained alive, a relative had given the order
to have_the1n removed from life support.

Had the airlock stayed open the entire
contest, it wouldn’t have done nearly as
much damage to the Carrier Dome as
McNabb did to Pitt’s defense with that one
play. He rarely pitched the ball to his nmriing
backs, but the threat of a pitch gave the quar-
terback more room to run He ﬁnished with
just under 100 yards on the ground, more
than any running back on either team could
muster. .

Then, midway through the fourth quar-
ter, he ﬁnally did pitch  to wide receiver

Kevin Johnson, who ran in the other direc-
tion for a touchdown on the dreaded option-
reverse play. Pitt used the option-reverse
play to score on Rutgers ', but on Saturday
the Panther version of the option ﬁzzled .

Matt O’Connor proved that he isn’t an
option quarterback, nmning the play twice
for a total of minus two yards and a fumble.
When he reached the line of scrimmage on
the second play, O’Connor actually looked
like someone who had been ejected from an
airlock while holding a football - in shock,
he immediately stopped moving, then began
pumping his anns violently, ﬁrst toward his
chest and then away from it. His two-hand-
ed grip on the ball could have crushed even
the strongest space helmet.

Finally, when his oxygen ran out, he
tried to pitch. ‘Before he could, though, a
blob of orange helmets and blue jerseys
drilled him for a 2-yard loss. The Pitt oﬁense
would ﬁnd its groove under Matt Lytle later
in the game, but McNabb could not be
stopped. . 3

And apparently, neither could the
Canier Dome. Despite the whole three sec-
onds when the airlock doors all ﬂew open at
once, no reports of disaster have surfaced

The bubble will live another day.

It’s a shame Pitt’s bowl hopes won’t.
