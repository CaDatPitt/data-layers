Noted Attorney Speaks on
' Race In Industry

Revolution-—social, economical,
and political-— as the only means
of emaiicipating the American
white workingman and negro work-
ingman from continued oppression
by the capitalist ruling class was
the theme of a talk by‘Russell
Patterson, noted negro attorney,
of New York City, before the In-
quiry Club, March 23, in 107 Alum-
ni Hall.

Mr. Patterson maintained that
the supposed inferiority of the
black man to the white man is
a myth created and kept up by
the ruling class in order to ex-
ploit Negroes in America.

The problem of the negro, he
argued, is a. social, not a racial,
one, and attempts are being made
by the white, and negro, laboring
classes to solve this problem in
spite of the interference of the
capitalists. . '

At the end of Mr. Patterson’s
talk, an open forum was held dur-
ing which several interesting ques-
tions were discussed relative to
the feasibility of new economic

Seniors Plan
Queen Ballot

Box in Heinz House Is
Ready for Opinions

'-Several important changes in the
method of selecting the Senior
Queen have been recommended by
this year's Senior Queen Commit-
tee. This committee composed of
Hilda Rubin, Ed. chairman, Harri-
et Davies, Ed., Christine Ruoff,
Col., Louise ‘Linn, Ed., and Jean
Davis, Col., was appointed by the
executive committee of the senior
class. to draw up a set of rules
that will govern the election and to
nominate the six candidates from
which the Senior Queen ,,will be
chosen on April» 13 at the annual
spring election,

The committee suggests combin-
ing some of the best features of
last year's procedure with the new
regulations which they propose.
The same system of balloting that
was created last yearwith the co-
operation. of the political science
department will be. used with the
important exception that there will
be only one election instead of two.
Each person voting will mark the
names on the ballot according to
the preferential system, placing (1)
after his first cho-ice, a (2) after
the second and so on to the end of
the list. The candidate receiving
the highest number of votes will
-become -Senior‘ Queen and the sec-
ond highest will be named Alma
Mater. Only the candidates on the
ballot will be voted for. Any bal-
lots marked with names not on
this list will not be counted.

Suggest Names Today

In order that the members of the
senior class may have an opportuni-
ty to express individual preferenc-
es before the election, a ballot box
will’~be placed in Heinz House this
afternoon. Suggestions for candi-
dates may be placed in this box
by seniorsany time up until next
Tuesday evening. The names sub-
mitted will be considered by the
committee; then they will make up
the list of six coeds from which
the Senior Queen will be chosen.

Thegqualifications which will be
considered in the selection of the
candidates are scholarship, person-
ality, character, poise and leader-
ship in activities.

J. C. Charlesworth, instructor in
political science who was instru-
mental in establishing the new
voting system last year, will assist
again this year. To him will be en-
trusted the counting of the ballots
so that the results may remain
secret until May 6, when they will
be announced at the annual Tap-
ping Assembly. A brief pageant is
being planned by the committee
for the presentation of these
awards.

Inaugurate New Football
Student-Mandger System

A new student manager plan
will receive its first trial during
the coming football season at Pitt.

Under the old plan no manage-
rial candidate ‘received an award
until the end of his junior year, and
only one freshman manager was
taken along on the trips taken by
the freshman teams. ,

The new plans provide for the
awarding of numerals to freshman
candidates on,the completion of
their first year of service, whether
they intend to return the following
year or not.

Minor letters will be awarded
to sophomores, keys to juniors,
with the regular varsity letter go-

Efforts to obtain Walter Lipp-

of the entire: convention hold that
much of the interest will be taken
out of the convention by not having
outstanding personalities clashing
on the major political issues. They
maintain that all of the publicity

Each team required an extra
period of play before it was crown-
ed champion of its division. The A.

the regulation period in their game
with Psi omega for the Dental
championship. In the extra period,
Joe Frledler, fro-sh Player Of tW0

the Dr. H. E. Friesell trophy which
goes annually to the winning team.

Ted Dailey, football letterman

‘Cage League

Tech, Temple, W. Va.,
Georgetown Members

 

Conferences and leagues seem
to be in -style this year, and the
announcement that a new intercol-
l-egiate floor league has been form-
ed does not create as much sur-
prise as is usual in such cases.

Pitt, West Virginia, Carnegie
Tech, Georgetown and Temple
comprise the personnel of the nqv
league.

Four of these schools were also
members of the late boxing confer-
ence. The formation of the new
group was nearly completed when
Gabriel Murphy, graduate manager
at Georgetown, came to Pittsburgh,
and met with the other athletic
heads who were in town for the
boxing tournament.

Since most of the schools are
scheduled to play each other dur-
ing the next season, few schedule
changes will be necessary. A hand-
some silver trophy will be given
the winner of.’ the conference.
Temple University will provide the
first trophy.

W_ D. Harrison, Pitt’s athletic
head, was elected first president
of the organization, with Harry A.
Stansbury, West Virginia athletic
head, as vice-president. Clarence
Overend, graduate manager of ath-
letics at Carnegie. was elected
secretary-treasurer.

Panther Spihers Meet

track and field men are preparing
diligently for their opening meet
with Ohio State on April 23.

Several new candidates reported
to Shea during the past week, and
from present indications, Pitt's
famed mile relay team may under-
go a change before it makes its
first scheduled outdoor appearance
in the Penn Relays on April 30.

The best swimming talent of the

More than fifteen schools have
entered teams. In the city, South

the outlying districts, Munhall,

three Erie teams, Academy High,

Junior Relay

For the high schools there will
be events in every class of swim-
ming: 40 yard free style, 100 yard
free style, 220' yard free style, 100

stroke, a fancy diving contest, and
a 160 yard relay race. For the
juniors, several relays will also be
held.

Handsome gold, silver
place winners in all events, and a
cup goes to the winning relay
team. A trophy will be awarded to
the team scoring the highest num-
ber of points. Medals will also be
awarded the winners of the Uni-

Pitt Boxers Demonstrate
Before Midland Rotarians

 

Although the regular boxing Sea‘
son ended officially with the Teph
match, the Pitt boxers continued

_ to keep in the well known “Dink-"

The latest development in this
ritual came last night when eight
of the varsity and freshman boxers
demonstrated the gentle art of self
defense, with Coach Orsini deliver-
ing words of explanation, before
an unusually large and enthusias-
tic crowd at the - Midland (Pa.)
Rotary Club. The occasion. was
one of the many smokers that
Rotaries are noted for.

Schricker Seigel, Namlick, lS'an-
ticola, Martin, Speigel, Zaiden and
Louick made the trip. -

This will probably mark the var-
sity men's last appearance this
season, although the fresh will
still carry on for the coming intra-
mural tournament.

Benefit

By JOE ORSINI I
Pitt Boxing Coach

The benefits derived from parti-
cipation in intramural athletics is a
question that lingers in the mind
of any student who is not in any
form of athletic activity. An intra-
mural program. is designed to bring
the students not engaged in any
specific sport into a better and
more spirited relationship with var-
ious sports. The one thing that has
been lacking in student activities
at many universities is the bring-
ing out of these so-called non ath-
letic members into sports. It brings ,
to the fore the important subjectsf
of physical development, Too many;
of our students do not realize the!
value of clean sport as a means
of developing the body and anoth-
er large group is monopolizing the
athletic stage and leaving scholas-
tic endeavor to a very minor por-
tion of the class. The intramural
program will attempt to regulate
athletics so that participation in
sports will not be dominated by
any specific group.

Activity Within

Intramural activity is any form
of activity within the “walls” of a
university or school. It furnishes
an opportunity for competitive
physical activity to students who
are not required to take regular
physical education. It affords those
’already required to engage in such
activity an opportunity to better
themselves. Lastly it affords each
and every student an opportunity
for team membership, and some
health maintaining, morbidity-desv
troying activity.

The necessity of improving the
national physique, of eliminating
softness, and of introducing fight-
ing spirit, is a present and future
challenge to physical educators.
The value derived from such a
program that is properly conducted
tends to improve the health, schol-
arship and general efficiency of all
those participating. The intramural
program to have any lasting result
must have the idea “Everybody in
the game.” It seems logical that
men who are not afforded a chance
in intercollegiate ’s‘ports“shou1d be
given a chance in the form of in-
tramurals.

Unless students realize what
benefits such a program as an in-
tramural one brings out, it will
find itself in the infancy stage.
Sportsmanship is the benefit that
is instilled from participation in in-
tramural activity. Without true
sportsmanship, athletics fall short

Intramural Athletics

to Students

of their possibilities. Appeal for
clean play is always evident. It
provides for clean habits and bet-
ter mental responses. It provides
for real student leaders for intra-
mural work. The positive leader-
ship of “varsity athletics” in in-
tramural work is a great stimulus.
Developing class and general col-
lege spirit is generally used. The
development of too intense a spir-
it is a danger. Then again it af-
fords one -an opportunity to play
before a crowd.
Not Advanced

Intramural athletics is not ad-
vanced as a complete system of
physical education, and in order
to do so, stimulation of such a
program is advisable. It will reach
its greatest value as a part of a
graded system of required physical
training in colleges and schools. It
will add to the more formal work,
social and moral factors, enthusi-
asm and competitive zest. This
true competitive spirit will be nec-
essary to every live American in
the coming days which will chal-
lenge our very best. The fighting
spirit which has its expression in
competitive sports is playing and
will play a real part in the future
war. College men are stepping for-
ward for leadership. It is our duty
to see that these men who will
furnish much of our fighting lead-
ership are truly and thoroughly
ready in so far as it is in our pow-
er.

Scmages
Feature Of
Grid Drills

Name Jock Sutherland
C o a c-h of All» -
North Team. _

At last the spring football squad
is finding out what real grid work
is. Despite the fact that the.,te§m
is putting on the steam, thenumber
of men reporting to practice," is, in-
creasing every d-am. Before thin!
week, the afternoons were» taken
up by light drills and calisthenics;
but now the candidates are scrim-
maging, which is not quite_ so
monotonous as other forms of
drill. At least, this is the imi-"'88-
sion of anyone watching the men
working out.

“Scrimmage is the only way a
coach or anyone can get a. line On
the actual value of the various
members of the squad,“ contends
Coach Sutherland. “Blackboard
drills, lectures and quarterback
meetings are all right ‘to find the
mental alertness of the player but
scrimmage is the one and only
way to drive home what the coach
is trying to put across, Yes,- sir,
give me real bodily contact to
teach fundamentals.

Spring Best ' —

“Spring sessions are thebest
chances a coach has to form an
opinion of the ability of the player
and other schools can abolish it if
they will, but Pitt will stick by
it. Furthermore talk on overem-
phasis by spring training is wholly
without foundation. Those fanatics
do not look at it from the‘VieW-
point of the player. ‘They forget
that these pre-season workouts
help put the players in -proper
physical condition and that they
also show the candidates who- real-
ly cannot play well that he cannot
gain a varsity berth. Of course this
latter instance is comparatively
rare, for even if the candidate has
not the ability,
the others on.”

If the fine weather holds out
and the squad continues its pres-
ent rate of development, the. length
of spring training this year will
be cut accordingly. Because the
staff has such a large squad to
work with, the team seems to be
making progress a little slower
than might be expected. The other
day there were eight teams frol-
icking about the Trees practice.

Don’ t Give Up

 

THE MODEL ' POLITICAL

Convention, about which
there has been so much ofa
ﬂurry during the past two
months, appears in imminent
danger of failure.

Delegates will meet at noon
today to decide whether or not
it shall be feasible to attempt
the meetings without the add-
ed interest that would be
created by the presence of an
outstanding political leader.
Frustrated at almost every
turn in its efforts to attract
some nationally known politic-
al ﬁgure, the committee in
charge of arrangements has ap-
parently come to the conclu-
sion that little interest will be
shown in the proceedings of
the model conclave without a
“big name” back of it.

It would be unfortunate
should the delegates give up
after so "much thought and et-
fort ha.s already been expend-

'ed on the project. The great-
est beneﬁt to be derived from
the meetings would not neces-
sarily come from what any
group of men prominent in
present-day political activities
might ‘have to say. It would
seem that the discussion, the
committee conferences, and the
complete consideration of con-
temporary issues might prove
of inﬁnitely more importance
than would any group of set
talks.

‘The model “convention” de-
serves a try. Sentiment in fa.-
vor of the project should be
greater than disappointment
occasioned by the inability to
obtain, as a guest, any prom-
inent individual.

What Do You Think ?

 

ELL, THE BOYS are at it

again and this time they
have decided to take a vote.
You, as a student are going to
have a chance next week to
decide whether or not the or-
ganization now known as Stu-
. dent Council shall continue to
exist. ’

Chalk one up for the petition‘-
ers! They submitted 300
names to Council asking for,
dissolution of that body and
there was nothing else to do
but hold a referendum.

The curious thing about it all
is, that probably any number
of students will be asked to
vote next week and will there-
by learn for the ﬁrst time that
Student Council is really a
campus activity. At any rate,
it’s interesting and not without
its amusement.

Dr. Stephan Outlines
County Relief Work

   

Dr. Frederick F. Stephan address-
ed the meeting of the Inquiry Forum
Wednesday, on the subject “The
Present Relief Crisis in Allegheny
County."

Dr. Stephan is assistant profes-
sor of sociology at‘the University
and is also director of the bureau
of social research. He is an author-
ity on the unemployment and re-
lief situation in Allegheny county.

In his talk, Dr. Stephan demon-
strated, with the aid of maps, the
types of relief carried on in the
county, He said that Pittsburgh
differs from other large cities in
that a great deal of relief is car-
ried out with the aid of private
agencies including the American
Red Cross, the Salvation Army,
theJewish Aid Society and the Vol-
unteers of America. These agencies
contribute thirty per cent of the
welfare and relief funds besides
doing a large amount of case work.

“The Allegheny County Emer-
gency Association was organized
in an attempt to secure employ-
ment for wage earners but It was
not able to carry out its program
because of the difficulty in secur-
ing jobs,” Dr. «Stephan said.

Dr. Stephan concluded his talk
by saying that the present relief
situation is a crisis in that what
relief ther has been in the past

Tennessee and Western

The return of the south-touring
debating team will revive a some-
what lagging schedule and local
speakers will meet three other col-
lege teams in debates before home

daudiences next week. On April 5,

both the University of Tennessee

and Western Reserve University
will come here. Both debates will
be on the centralized control ques-
tion. The University of Tennessee
will be met before an audience of
the Electric Light League of Pitts-
burgh. Inasmuch as Samuel Strauss
Col. '32, is a native of Bristol, a
town near Knoxville, where ‘Tennes-
see is located it is likely thathe
will be selected to meet the south-
ern team. Cyril Jacobs, Bus. Ad.
’32_ who accompanied Strauss on
the western trip is likely to be
selected as the other debater.

The Western Reserve debate is
scheduled to take place before an
audience of the Ladies Auxiliary
of the Allegheny Council Knights
of Columbus. The team for this
debate has not yet been selected.
On April 7 Colby College of
Waterville, Maine, will be here to
debate a.local team. The Colby~for-
ensicers will be in the midst of an
extensive western tour such as
that made by Men‘s Debating As-
sociation team. The debate will

“take place before the Dormitory

Club of the Downtown Y.

Two more debates will then re-
main on the card. One will be with

Coeds Defeat
US Champion

National Contest Victor
Loses Pitt Debate

 

 

The women’s debating team has
returned from an extensive south-
ern tour with the distinction of
having defeated the team from
Virginia State Teachers’ College‘
that won first place in the annual
forensic contest held last spring in
Dallas, Texas. This contest was

sponsored by Pi Kappa Delta, na-
tional honorary debatlng fraterni-
ty, and included colleges all over
the United States.

This is not consistent with the
policy of the women's debating at
Pitt. which has been for several
years to encourage nondecision de-
bates with open forum discussions
rather than judge or audience de-
cisions. i.

Coach Theresa Kahn is of the
opinion that “This victory is signi-
ficant because it proves that our
team can compete with the best
teams when competition of that
Soft is required. We favor a policy
of nondecision debates at Pitt be-
cause we feel that it encourages
the debaters to work because they
are genuinely interested in the
question. Especially has it been
proved to us on this trip that the
best teams are turned out by the
schools that follow this method."

The team spent a weekend in
Washington, visiting both houses
of congress while they were engag-
ed in active debate. From Norfolk
they traveled to New York by boat
over Chesapeake Bay. The debate
with New York University was
broadcasted over the national net-
work. .

The negative team from the Uni-
versity of West Virginia will be in
Pittsburgh on April 27. The debate
will be sponsored by the Overbrook
League of Women Voters. Pitt will
argue in favor of government own-
ership and operation of the forces

men women from the Weekly staif they decided to edit their

A monthly publication, the Fresh Script, is edited by such
fresh luminaries as Florence King, Hazel Lincoln, Bee Kop-
and Janet‘%—

Slease. Their second script is
new ‘fresh from the press, colu-
umned with up-to-date coed news,
timely feature stories, a Winchel-
lesque coumn headed “Panthericia
Pitt,” and even a poem thrown in
for good measure.

One feature. story -burlesquing
the facts of the survey history
class, was commented upon by the
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. Reading
this story we ﬁnd that the ﬁrst
centry A. D. was called the “Gold-
en Age" because a great deal of
gold was used, that Aristophanes
is .a. river in North’ East -Arabia,
and that Hellenistic Greece was
named after Helen of Troy.

The editors of the Fresh Script
hope to make their new attempt a
lasting one. To quote Helen Lay,
associate editor, “We hope that the
script will continue to be published
each year by the new freshmen
coeds. This script is a worthy ex-
periment for young journalists.”

All right, coeds, but won’t you
try not to put the Pitt Weekly out
