Dentristy school gets state aid

By Julie Shepard

Staff Writer

Pitt's School of Dental Medi-
cine is undergoing a facelift after
20 years of residence in Salk Hall.

According to Dr. Sidney Spatz,
director of clinical affairs and
‘chairman of orallandmaxilofacial
surgery,. the school's reconstruc-
tion willybe financed by a $20
million state legislative grant that
will include enlargement of the

school's physical structure and -

more technologically advanced
equipment in its dental clinic.

Spatz said the present dental
equipment in the clinic is in ”bad
shape.” He claims that it is a
”constant battle to keep things

going.”

JERUSALEM (AP) - Israeli Offi-
cials Monday challenged claims
by the Abu Nidal Palestinian ter-
rorist group that it kidnapped
eight Israelis from a yacht off the

’ heavily guarded coast of the oc-

cupied Gaza Strip-

Foreign Minister Shimon Peres
and Defense Minister Yitzhak
Rabin described the hostage-
taking claim as an attempt by
Palestinian extremists to under-

  

Spatz estimates that only 60 to
70 percent of the equipment is

working at any given time in the
clinic, and its is being used by
roughly 80 students everyday for
a variety of necessary dental
operations on actual patients.

The construction is expected to
take about 20 months. The den-
tal school and clinic will remain
open during the actual work.

”There is an additional amount
of noise and dust from the work
that we simply have no control
over,” said Spatz. ”Students must
be more aware of their time — it
is hard to tell if and when a water
line might break.”

It's really a big thing,” said a
second year dental student who
wished to have his name with-

vened Sunday in Jordan.
Increasing. uncertainty sur-
rounded the affair, with doubts
cast about the identity of the ter-
rorist group, the identities of the
reported victims, and even
whether a kidnapping occurred.
‘'1 more than doubt that it hap-
pened in the vicinity of Israel,”
Rabin told reporters at a war
memorial outside Jerusalem.

come very close to the shores of
Israel. They know what our navy

redoing its dental facilities for
well over five years. Now that the
changes are actually in effect,
they will definitely help the stu-

completed.”

The student said that the excess
noise and dust don't affect him
and his peers as much as it does
their patients.

”Many patients are already ner-
vous when they're coming in for
treatment,” he said. ”The con-

JERUSALEM — A chemistwho

 it helped uncover the 1983 Adolf
if . Hitler diaries hoax testified Mon-

day at John Demjanjuk’s Nazi
war crimes trial that it was unlike-
ly the retired U.S. autoworker
signed an SS identity card that al-
legedly bears his signature.
The witness, Julius Grant, was
called to bolster defense claims
that the document, which al-
legedly shows Demjanjuk was
trained as a death camp guard,
was forged by the Soviet Union.
Six prosecution experts have
testified that the so-called
Trawniki card was authentic.
The British-born Grant, 86, told
the court he compared Demjan-
juk’s alleged signature on the

lb ; card with 18 undisputed samples

of the defendant's handwriting

 and determined ”that common
‘authorship is unlikely.”
V ”I cannot visualize a person

who writes in the style and
character of the signature [on the

  SS card] as being responsible for

IRA admits to planting
bomb that killed 11

ENNISKILLEN, Northern
Ireland —_ The Irish Republican
Army Monday admitted planting
a bomb that killed 11 civilians
and injured 63 but said it intend-
ed to kill security forces, and the
device went off prematurely.

In a statement issued to news
agencies in Dublin, the Irish cap-
ital, the outlawed nationalist
guerrilla group said it deeply
regretted Sunday's bombing.

The statement said an IRA unit
planted the bomb with the aim of
killing British soldiers and North-

ern Ireland police but had not
triggered the radio-controlled
device.

Instead, it said, a British army
”high—frequency scanning
device" had triggered the bomb.

Caliguiri’s '88 budget
contains no taxihike

PITTSBURGH — Pittsburgh
Mayor Richard Caliguiri Monday
proposed a 1988 city budget of
$292.7 million, an increase of 3.8
percent over the current year,
with no increase in tax rates for
the sixth straight year.

Caliguiri, in his ”State of the
City” message to City Council,
said his proposed budget calls for

an estimated $1.1 million in in-,

creased fees and new fees for
users of the city's 35 swimming
pools.

The mayor said Pittsburgh city
government's financial future ”is
not bright” without tax reform to
give the city new revenue

sources. Caliguiri has long fa-'

vored an income tax on suburban
commuters working in the city.

The proposed budget calls for

PHILADELPHIA — A Charity

Kenneth L. Hawkins, Better

Goldstein said it is registered
now and a certificate has been is-

money raised from May to July.

then.” _

Lash said that the security doors
and the elevators in Holland Hall
malfunctioned

Lisa Leonard, a Pitt Freshman
living in Holland Hall, said the
building's electricity worked par-
tially through the day.

”Most of the lights were out,”
said Leonard. ”|t’s a pain in the
neck. One of the elevators didn't

work and there was no lights in
the other one.”

”The power was- on and off
about ‘five times,” said Steve
Book, a Pittjunior living in Brack-
enridge Hall. ’’It [the power]
usually came on for about 15
minutes and then went off for
about a half an hour.”

Lash said that Holland Hall's
generator broke down in the
morning, and at 12:30 p.m. the

building's back-up generator was
activated to provide power.

Lash went on to say that the
blackout was the largest one he's
seen at Pitt.

Sandi Delisio, a desk clerk at
Amos Hall, said that her building
only lost its lighting.

”A lot of the girls were talking
about buying candles,” she said.

”The biggest inconvenience
was not being able to study for
my test in the comforts of my

room,” said Book.

”A lot of people have tests and
can't study,” said Kellie Gomo-
lak, a Pitt Junior living in Brack-
enridge Hall. ”Most people don't
feel like going to the library in
weather like this.

”We just went grocery shop-
ping,” she added. ”Now we
wasted all the food [in the
refrigerator].”

The Student Health office was
alsoaffected by the blackout.

’’It was really hard to get work- ' A 

ing in there," said Glen Schneid-
er, a Pitt sophmore and CPR

instructor for the health office. ’’It 1 

was hard getting organized.” '

The Pittsburgh Theological

Seminary offers joint-degree
programs for both male and fe-
male students in many reli-
gious faiths.
' The program is designed to
allow students interested in
theology the opportunity to
study the discipline while con-
tinuing with their university
classes.

According to Ray Luber,
director of public relations for
the seminary, applicants must
be accepted by the University
of Pittsburgh as well as the
seminary.

”Our main thrust is on the

, master of divinity degree
which is the basic profession-
al degree,” Luber said.

Although almost 50 percent
of the seminary’s student body
is non-Presbyterian, the semi-
nary is basically interested in

Pitt students can
earn degree in
Theology studies

training students for the Pres-
byterian church.

A typical joint—degree pro-
gram includes the master of di-
vinity and Pitt's master of
social work. By choosing the
joint-degree program, semi-
narians eliminate a year of
study that non-joint-degree
students must take.

The Presbyterian church re-
quires each person to pass a
standardized ordination test
which is examined and ap-
proved by a local presbytery.
Students also must have a call
to serve either in a church or
an approved ministry which
has been authorized by a Pres-
byterian church. Other re-
quirements depend upon the
specific religious denomina-
tion of the student. _

The seminary is part of the
Pittsburgh Council of Higher
Education and an academic
associate with the University
of Pittsburgh. '

PHILADELPHIA’-— The popu-
lar stereotype of unwed teenage
mothers is inaccurately portrayed
because many are able to drasti-
cally turn their lives around and
not become . entrapped in
poverty, a sociologist said.

ii

T.

”The conventional wisdom
holds that virtually all teenage
mothers end up as high school
dropouts, as welfare recipients,
and are. likely to have very large
families with children who are,
invariably, experiencing" prob-
lems,” sociologist Frank Fursten-
bergjr. said in a recent interview.
”That image is really very mis-

leading.”

Furs_tenberg, a professor at the
University of Pennsylvania, and
Penn colleague and sociologist 5.
Philip Morgan and Jeanne
Brooks-Gunn from the Education-
al Testing Service, conducted a
major study that followed the
lives of more than 300 black
adolescent mothers from Balti-
more for 17 years and their
children.

The study, Adolescent Mothers

in Later Life, was recently pub-
lished by Cambridge University

Press. lt traces the group of preg-

nant teenagers from their preg-
nancies in the late 1960s until the
mid-19805, when they were in
their 305.

’’What this study shows is that
even when you take a large group
of young mothers who come
from disadvantaged mothers, the
majority of them manage to
climb out of poverty,” said Fur-
stenberg who has been involved
with the study since its beginning
in 1966. ’’It tells us a great deal
about the commitment and moti-
vation of the poor.”

The study found that about 25
percent of the women were on
welfare when they reached their
early 30s, but a quarterof the
women have incomes that place
them clearly in the middle class.

Most teenage mothers are eco-
nomically self-sufficient when
they reach their early 305, said
Furstenberg. ”They don't become

I Men Without Hats come back with pop and new souls

31?:

By Dave Zafris

Staff Writer

After some prolonged soul-
searching, Men Without Hats is
back. *

Ivan, the group's restless and
provocative singer/songwriter
and chief instigator, recently
completed a three-year global
journey of personal discovery
and brought back Pop Goes The
World, their Mercury/PolyGram
debut album.

lvan’s trip began in 1984,
when he found his world was
both bigger and smaller than it
had ever been before. Men

t~,€\l€R>’TiM€ I We NI>eR IF-mews

Without Hats had achieved inter-

. national stardom with their debut

album, Rhythm Of Youth.

The LP’s single, ”Safety
Dance,” reached number three
on the U.S. charts and the Top 10
of 20 different countries.

Success expanded lvan’s per-
spective from his hometown of
Montreal to the world at large,
but he also experienced the flip-
side — the fishbowl of fame.

When the follow-up album,
Folk of the '80s (Part III), did not
perform well commercially, bus-
iness pressures and conflicting
priorities drained the band.

In the three-year jaunt to Spain,

London, New York‘and other ci-

, ties, Ivan wrote songs painting a

more positive outlook of the
world. ‘

He came up with an uplifting
song cycle titled ”Pop Goes. the
World” and turned it into a mu-
sically complex album filled with
bouncy pop riffs and optimism._

The music blends new elec-
tronics with the sound and feel of
past influences.

Jethro Tul|’s Ian Anderson —
whose concept LP Thick As A
Brick was a pop influence —
plays flute in the dreamy ”On
Tuesday.”

Essential to the title song is a

called Jenny, as Ivan explained.

’’I was overwhelmed by the
star trip the first time. I went
through a crisis of conscience
and set out to become more
aware of the world around me.
One thing that came up for me
was the power of women. I be-
gan studying poetry and develop-
ing a new side of myself, which
Jenny represents — a person at a
young age of discovery,” he said.

The sense of childlike discov-.

ery extends to the images creat-
ed for the LP cover and the video,
‘Ivan, a former’ film student, con-
tested.

”There’s a snowman that plays
drums, and my brother Stefan
plays the role of ‘Johnny the
guitarist. They're meant to appeal
to kids, really, the way kids see
life as something non-violent,
non-sexist and non—racist.

”I think this album has a realis-
tic optimism,” Ivan said. ”After
‘Safety Dance,’ I realized what a
platform pop could be.

”Who was I to try to cure the
world, and how could I hope to
do it? You have to keep your
hopes way up, but you also have
to be aware of some of the terri-
ble things going on around us
and not be crushed by it. You
have to react to it.”

INXS: the Aussies don’t Kick anything with latest album

‘ If there's anything that can be
said about INXS, it's that they are
creative. Kick, their latest release,
follows in their pattern of not
repeating the same mood from al-
bum to album.

The album doesn't start off any-
where close to the quick pace of
Listen Like Thieves, the band's
last release. The first song on the
new album, ”Guns In The Sky,"

~ is just out of INXS’ creative abili-

ty to grasp well. INXS just doesn't
sound right singing about SDI

and nucleairi weapons, evLenVr

though they have the courtesy
not to be blatant about it.

Although ”Guns” starts the
side off slowly, ”New Sensation”
and ”Devil Inside” both get back
to the typical INXS style of deal-
ing with men and women. ”New
Sensation” is lacking a central
theme, even though it would ap-
pear to be vaguely about
”togetherness,” it never comes to
the point of what the sensation is.

”Devil Inside” is a biting
reminder that it's not supernatur-

al beings thaticauselproblems on.’ 

Earth but rather the ”devil in-
side”every person.

These songs all lead up to
”Need You Tonight,” which is
the strongest song on the album.
The song is full of subdued ten-
sion, conveyed well in Michael
Hutchence’s lyrics. The song
depicts the raw sexual energy of
a man who has been carefully
watching some woman and can't
fall asleep because of her.

"Mediate” is another song
about people causing problems
for other people. The lyrics are

cohesive attempt to define what
; needs ”mediated.”

”The Loved One” and ”Never
Tear Us Apart" are about love
relationships.s”Never” is a much
more reflective song than the up-
beat ”The Loved One.”

The title track,"Kick,” doesn't
quite live up to its namesake,
although a mid-song saxophone
solo and a trumpet player try to
lend the lyrics some of the ener-

’ gy they lack.

though it does offer some good .

material and seemingly tries to fo-
cus on the relationship of person-
to-person problems and nation-

to-nation problems, it doesn't.

quite bridge the credibility gap.

Perhaps Andrew Farriss and
Michael Hutchence were a little
wary of stuffing an album with
their view of the world, for-fear

it would turn fans off, but the mix _

offered is too weak to make a po-

. litical statement and present

songs about people.

Back in the saddle again? You
bet. Aerosmith put on a show that
took you right back into the '70s.

Sure, they have out a new al-
bum that is climbing the charts,
and sure, the album is their best
effort in over 10 years, but the
band played almost nothing from
this latest album last Thursday
night.

The electronic system, used by
both Dokken and Aerosmith did
not produce good sound. All of
the lyrics were muffled, and the
leads that were played by the
guitarists were often drowned out

"by the bass and drums. But, what

you could hear and understand
was worth the listening._
The show opened with Dok-

_ ken, a relatively new metal band.

‘r.

Vocalist Don Dokken (namesake
of the band) can, unlike a lot of
metal vocalists, sing —— and very
well at that.

Guitarist George lynch proved
that he belongs up there with the
rest of the guitar gods. The only

thing wrong with Dokken’s mus-

ic is that it could have given you
a headache for because it was too
loud.

Aerosmith took the stage at
about 9 p.m. They were a bit
sloppy again, but that only last-
ed through the first few songs.
They opened with ”Toys in the

Attic” and then played just about
anything you wanted to hear. The
only new material the band per-
formed was ”Dude (Looks Like a
Lady)/’

There were several highlights
of the evening. One was the over-
all appearance and enthusiasm of
Aerosmith who got the crowd's
attention early into the show and
kept it the rest of the night.

Steven Tyler's voice sounded
better than it has in quite some
time, as he was able to hit every
high note in ”Dream On” to his
famous raspy squeals in numbers

A such as ”Last Child.”

Musically speaking, the better
songs of the evening were ”Big
Ten lnch,” for which Tyler played
his harp, the very bluesy
”Walkin’ the Dog,” and of
course, ”Dream On.”. Never
have I seen so many cigarette
lighters lit or so many people
singing along with the song. ’

For an encore, Aerosmith
played its most well-known song.
According to Rolling Stone maga-
zine, Tyler was quoted as saying,
’’I’m really fucking tired of play-
ing that song.” He was, of course,

referring to the encore, ”Walk

This Way.”

It was a pretty good show. Aer-
osmith gave a better performance
than they gave the last time they
were here. It would have been
even better with a sound system
that worked adequately.

Saxophone ‘player Nathan Davis led the jazz fest

 

I 4-

Fine performance graces jazz seminar

By Adam Gottlieb

For The Pitt News

Last Saturday night, Pittsburgh
was given a rare treat. It was the
closing of the 17th Annual Jazz
Seminar at Pitt, and what a clos-
ing it was.

The events ended with a jazz
concert at the Carnegie Music
Hall. An all-star line up featured
the talents of saxophonists Grover
Washington Jr. and Nathan
Davis. The keyboard skills of Pa-
trice Rushen and Phillip Woo as
well the explosive trumpeting of
Jimmy Owens and Mike Moss-
man were displayed, along with

the spectacular bass playing of
Ray Drummond and the superb
drumming of Marvin ”Smitty"
Smith. .

It was definitely a milestone
meeting for jazz. Unfortunately,
an illness prevented flautist
Hubert Laws to attend.

The group was great and real-
ly worked well together, which
was obviously due to the au-
dience's response in the sold-out
hall. The group played numerous
sets, with each performer taking
his/her turn for a solo.

The standouts of the evening
were Washington with his
phenomenal rendition of ”Stella

by Starlight” and Davis’ ”El Di-
ablo.”

The group was under the direc-
tion of Davis, Pitt's own jazz
studies director, who did an ex-

cellent job of leading the group. ‘

The highlight of the evening
was Washington's presentation of
his first soprano sax to the Inter-
national Jazz Hall of Fame. Un-
fortunately, this happened during
the intermission instead of at the
end of the concert. Presenting it
at the end would have permitted
more audience members to have
seen the ceremony. It would have’
been the perfect end to a perfect
