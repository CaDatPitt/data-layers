  URGES HONOR  
PLAN }'

After Careful Consideration It
Is Recommended to‘ Faculty
and Students; Other Schools
Have Adopted It

 

There is a demand by many in the
University that the honor system that-

has been adopted in many large insti-V

tutions be put in force in our own
University. The matter has been be-
fore the Board of Control for some
time, and the announcement is made
that that body favors its adoption.
The different schools will act sep-
arately upon adopting this system.

_ Already-the faculty of one school has ,
unofhczally signiﬁed their approval of

this system. The honor rsystemof
examinations has already been.
adopted by a number of the oldest
and most inﬂuential
Yale, Princeton, Cornell, \Nisconsin,

Chicago, Penn State and VV. & J. Col-

CDCEBATERS HOLD j,BIG MEETING

The ﬁrst meeting of. those inter-'
ested in intercollegiate debate ipwas’
held Monday morning. About,30 stu-
dents have -signiﬁed their intentions
of trying for the team and more can?
didates are needed. ‘Credits are’ given
to those who make the team, ‘Ar-

rangements have been made to debate ‘

with VVooster and_Allegheny. The
question submitted is: “Resolved,_
That the Several States Should Adopt

the Principle of" Compulsory (State. ‘

Boards of Arbitration in- the Settle-
ment of All Labor Disputes.” ’ _ «

STUDENTS EARN TUITION ,

The ‘spirit of the Pitts students in’ A

making their own way through the
University is shown by the great-
number. of men who have secured
work during the Christmas holidays,
Many of these students are working
from early morning until late at night’
and in all kinds of positions. Among
the places .where the men are work-
ing are the postoﬂice, warehouses and.
many of the downtown department
department stores. This‘ growing
tendency of the students to
good deserves the greatest commend-
ation.

TIMELY ADVICE FROM
' THE REGISTRAR

for the winter term, beginning Janu-

—to take immediate steps to complete
the matter before that day andtime.
Schedules are .now ready and can, in
many ‘cases, be made up and ap-
proved by the respective Deans with-
out any delay whatever. The irregu-
lar schedules and those dependent up-
on appointment should also receive
immediate attention, as with this early
opportunity for prompt, action there
need exist little reason for procrasti-

._ nation.

In making the schedule, see that
each card for the term is ‘fully and]
correctly made out both on front and
back. Every card, when it is ultimate-
ly ﬁled, must show subjects, course
numbers, number of credits for each
course, and, on the back in the form
prepared for the purpose, theschedule
showing the subject and place of reci-
tation. Note ﬁnally, and the excep-
tion is no reason for needless delay,
that on January 3rd and 4th, the Reg-
istrar’s office .will be Open for busi-
ness, and that these willbe the only
.days of the vacation period. If it is
desired and is more convenient, pay-
ment during vacation may be made by
mail. Do not ‘fail to send or bring all
‘three cards when completing registra-
tion. . , ' t
In addition to these requests relat-
ing to the coming term, a statement
concerning the report of work already
done is in place. -As the ﬁnal day of
the term is not until the 20th inst., and
as four calendar days after the" close

are allowed for the handing in of_re-
ports, it Will be manifestly impossible

Christmas. As soon thereafter as pos-

, sible reports will, according to cus-

tom, be sent by mail. In the nieai_i—
time, with this understanding, it is
expected that all interested will be as
patient as possible and especially that
they will refrain from asking questions
about their , particular selves and

time to answer. , . , ,

This leads to one. other statement
which should be made, and concern-
ing a matter in which the students
can be of great assistance in reducing-

,that very frequent requests are made
for transcripts of complete record,
especiallyvas the end of the course ap-
proaches. The Registrar is very will-
ing to compare your records _with his
own, which process will require'muc_h
less time and labor. Please bear in
mind, therefore, that term records
every one of them. It is then a com-
paratively simple matter to check up

unnec-
essarily duplicating records already
made and intended to be permanent.
The student is hardly aware how

ter means, but. a reminder on -this
point will no doubt sufﬁce.

the-, University, Penn will play the
Blue and Gold in basket ball.‘ Th,
managerof the basket ball team .has
been in conirriuiiication with Penn for
some time in regard to a game, and
ﬁnal arrangements were _made last
week for.’ as galne to be played here
on Decembe’r,27. . This contest will be
of- great interest to every member 01
the student body, and to followers of
the ﬂoor game in this city. It will
afford an opportunity to compare the
relative powers of the Pitt and_ the
teams, as Penn ranks well
among the eastern institutions. '

It is thought by .many that this
game will be the opening wedge for
contest between the two teams in
other lines of sport. Itimay not be
longibefgre Pitt and Penn will‘do
battle on the gridiron and on the dia-
mond, as well as on the basket ball
ﬂoor. "Altogether, Manager Me-

has been able to get the Red and Blue
on his schedule. A .

THE PITT WEEKLY

WAR CORRESPONDENT
_ SENDS IN REPORT

 

‘C. D. Diamond. sophomore in the
college department of the University,
who left six weeks ago"~for“Athens to
help defend his ‘native land against the
"AU-l'l(S,iZl.11‘(l who is acting as special

correspondent for The Pitt \/Veekly,
has been heard from. "He is very
optimistic about the outcome of the

..war, and is loud in 'his praise of the

Greek armyp He says in part:
_“The idea of a Balkan confedera-
tion was conceived by the Grwk
statesman Charilaos Tricoupis about
'1884, but it remained ﬁor Eleptherios
Venizelos, the present great premier
of Greece, to be the’Cavour of the
Balkans; to unite the Balkan states
against the common foe.” He pre-
pared the Greek army and navy for
war; reorganized thoroughly the dif-
ferent divisions. The achievements
of the Greek army "and. navy are
'known through the press; military
authorities were taken by surprise; the
Greek forces showed to the world
that they are equal to the best. The
organization of the other Balkan states
was wonderful, indeed the achieve-
nients of the Christ’ian armies sur-
passed all beliefs and expectations;

. in twenty days the Greek army cap-

tured Salonica; the; Servian army all
Northwestern l\/laciedonia; the B111-
gariaiis reached near Constantinople,
and little Montenegro is besieging
the capitol of Albani:.»~’~‘-codra. ‘In

she will accept the peacr ‘l)l'&.ll“‘ isals
now she may at least keep Constai ti-

‘; nople and small part of Thrace, but

if sheginsists with the usual Turkish
clumsiness she will not only lose Con-
stantinople but also her .Asiatic pos-
sessions. ‘Indeed, thetriuniph of the
cross is -complete; the land made
glorious by the great coiiqueror-—
Alexander t-he Great——will attain lib-
erty and prosperity!’ it will be open
to progress and education. Already
the governments of the Balkan states
have sent the necessary c'ivil-authori-
ties to establish law and order out of
the Young Turks’ chaos. _ ‘
“In Greece great enthusiasm pre-
vails; volunteers came from all parts
of the world. The Greeks of the
United States contributed liberally in
man and money. Volunteers from
all the islands of the Eagean sea, for-
merlv belonging to Turkey. came to
sacriﬁce themselves for the common
mother: indeed the willingness of the
Greeks living in foreign countries sur-
prised all expectations of.tl_ie govern-
ment. Greece has more than two
hundred thriusanrl men in the Field.
all‘ drilled and equipped with the best
guns—according to the opinion of an-
thorities. There are about seventy-

camp-——magniﬁcent spectacle indeed;
soldiers are drilled on the plain: 111)

selves unfortunatebecause we did not
go to the front yet. The campaign
has been so brief and the,movemeiit
of thearmies so rapid that the _Turk
has been annihilated. So there is no
need at ptesent for reinforcements.

TNT GOMMENTS ON -
THE colon QUESTION

Through the columns of the Sun,

 

.. “ Jas.*J.,Long, the well-known sporting

editor, has made a.}imely comment
on the coach question at the Univer-
sity. . Mr. Long usually has the right.
“dope” on most matters pertaining to
athletics, and his advice may-well be
followed in many instances.

He pointed out tlie fact that Coach

' Thompson started the season under a

severe handicap as almost the entire
squad was of prep school caliber, and
that no coach in the country could
‘have put out a ﬁnished machine. He
reminded -the ones who had forgotten

, Joe’s past achievements that it was

chieﬂy due‘ to Thompson that Pitt got
‘map and another
chance was due the former Gold and
Bluestar.

Mr. Long claims that Joe is one of
the best football experts in this coun-
try and will probably be appointed to
the Rules xCommittee..t'his year. He
also states‘ that if Joe wished to take
-up coaching at another institution he
would be snapped up in short order.

‘While Mr. -Long does not -under-
stand every phase of this question, he
is conservative, has great experience,
is unbiased in the affair, and his ad-
vice should be given more than pass-

ing - notice.

FRESHMEN--NOTICE

 

All freshmen who have‘ played
basketball are requested to report for
the freshmen team at the Trees gym-
and Thursday
evenings at 5 o’clock.

NOTES FROM PHYSICAL
EDUCATION DEPARTMENT

Mr. Proven is emphasizing the fact
that all freshmen and sophomores
must attend the gym classes regu-
larly. Attendance records are taken
and anyone who is not attending will
be compelled to take ~ the work in
their junior or senior years. So, get
a hustle on, you freshies and sophs.

An Inter-University Basketball
league is to be organized by ‘Mr.
Miller within a shyortptime. It has _not
been decided whether this is to be a
-class or a department league as yet.
The latter is thought to be the best
plan as it will‘a.1low e.ach of the four
professional and each of the four un-
der-graduate schools to enter teams.
Anyman who is interested, speak to
Mr. Miller about it.

Cross-country runs for track team
candidates are to be held every Mon-

,‘ day and Thursday afternoons under

the direction’ of Captain Rosenthal.

.The course starts at State Hall, con-

tinuesithrough Schenley Park and’
back to the gymnasium, approximate-
ly a three-mile run. All track men
get busy. ’

Basket Ball Manager Sends in Good
Card—-Several Eastern Teams Will
Be Met on Trip—Penn" Will Play

M at Pitt——Play at Trees Gymnasium
on December 27th. ’

 

The" basket ball schedule which

Manager W. C. MacQuown has just
completed is the best ever arranged
for a Gold and Blue. ﬂoor team. Mac-
Quown ‘had charge of «this department
of sport last year and did well with
his schedule, considering the fact that
basket ball was not recognized by the
Athletic‘ Committee until, rather late.
The biggest game which appears on
the list this year is one with the Um-
versity of Pennsylvania at Trees gym-
nasium on December 27th. This is
the first time that Pitt has met the
big Red and Blue ﬁve and it is hoped
by many that it will be an opening

wedge for further relations in all
branches of sport. The contest will
be the ﬁrst ever played at Pitt's

splendid ‘new gymnadum and should

bring out a large crowd of loyal Pitt I

followers, even though it is sched-
uled in the ‘holidays when many will

be away from the city. «While Coach’.

Flint is a graduate of Penn and a

former basket ball captain’ and star,“

he is bending every effort to put the
Gold and Blue ﬁve in shape to defeat
the Red'and Blue and expects his
pupils to give their opponents a hard
game. Manager M.acQuown _‘is at
present tryin-g to arrange a dance in
the gymnasium after the game, but has
not yet completed his plans and there
is apossibility of the arrangement
falling through. Further particulars
of this game will appeai in the next
issue of the Weekly. * ” .
The team plays six games in Jan-
uary, of which four are at Trees gym-
nasium; twelve games in February, of
which only two are on our own floor,

which are at home. The only criti-
cism we can make on this schedule
is that we have so few games at home,
we will hardly have a chance to be-
come acquainted with our players.

The men who look best at present

.KARL E. DAVIS ELECTED
' GRADUATE MANAGER

(Continued from Page 1)
years as stenographeij and assistant

V chief clerk, and later as private secre-

‘itary to the superintendent. This
branch of work gave him excellent

experience in office _work and stenog-"

raphy yvhich proved of great value to
'him in his athletic work later.

In 1906 he entered the civil engi-
neering class and graduated in 1910
with a degree of C. E During his
four years in the University he served
as a member of the Athletic Commit-
tee for two years, held the ‘offices of
‘President, Vice President and Secre-
tary in his class, was elected ‘Athletic
Editor of the.now extinct “Courant”
four times. and was a member of the
Student Senate. Besides the work
connected with these offices, Davis did
a great deal of publicity work for the
University, and at present is chairman
of the Publicity Committee. He is a
member of the Phi Zeta Phi fraternity.

Since his graduation he has been in
thexemploy of A. R. Hamilton, who
ﬁgures prominently in Pitt athletics
and all other activities of the Uni-

versity which he has time to attend.

Davis will keep this position and also
serve as graduate manager, both of
which he believes he will be able to
handle. At present Davis is chairman
ofthe University Athletic Committee,
a member of the Alumni Council,.and
also secretary of the Student Employ-
ment Bureau. The last has been
founded for nearly two yearg and
through the co-operation of Pitt’s
many alumni and local business men,
has ‘procured many positions for stu-
dents ‘for holidays andon graduation.
It is one of the best institutions in the
University and has been the means of
many students paying their way
throu.gh school.

Outside of university work, Davis
is a member of the Press Club and
the Pittsburgh
being secretary of the Athletic Com-
mittee of the latter. While Davis has
been very prominent in “the real
work” side of athletics and in other
University activities, he “ is very
modest and retiring, which has won
him many friends. ’

His selection as graduate anager
is a ﬁtting tribute to his energy,
loyalty and value as an athletic man-
ager, and if his past performances in-
dicate anything, he will certainly
make good with a vengeance.

TWO HOUR G_YM PERIOD-

 

On ,account of the time necessary
for the students to reach the gym, it
is being considered by the faculty to
have a two hour period "instead of the
one hour period now in vogue. So
much time is taken up by the stu-
dents in going back and forth,and in
dressing that a longer period has be-
:-come necessary.

A rousing success was the verdict
of -everyone who attended the student
football banquet at the.Hotel Schen-
ley last Saturday evening. About
250 persons were present and Pitt
spirit reigned. _

‘ Dr. Walther Riddle acted as toast-
masterand created much laughter in
introducing the speakers. Chancellor
S. B. McCormick was . t'he ﬁrst
speaker and offered a few introductory
remarks. Charles Miller, Director of
Athletics, made a M brief address in
favor of accepting A. R. Hamilton’s
offer to take the team to his’farm
near Johnstown next_ year .a few
weeks before the season opens. .

“Joe” Thompson stated that the Pitt
team has to be 20 per cent. better
than State or W. -& J. onaccount of
environment. ’ I '

“Hube” Wagner gave an enthusi-
astic-talk in which he said that every
man'son the team g e every inch of

Other enthusiastic speakers were:
Dr. A. F. Judd of‘ the School of
Pharmacy, a former player; L. B.

cu-.sse'd.i '

Sec. 4. VVhen the examination is
ﬁnished the ‘student must write the
following pledge on his examination
paper and sign his name:

WEEKLY

I "‘D'R. BIBLE SPEAKS

OF CHINESE PEOPLE

“The Chinese people have anoi_ntel—
lectual capacity and power which need
not be ranked second to that of any
other people of the"/world." This sur-
prising statement was made by Dr. F.
W. Bible during ‘his talk on the
Chinese people at the student assem-
bly last Friday.

Dr. Bible has been a missionary to
China for a number of years and has
come in close contact with almost
every phase of Chinese life. His ad-
dress was both interesting and in-
structive. He said in part:

“‘There are three facts which lie at the
bottom of the question which China
presents to itself and the western
world. The people" of China are a
people of first-class intellectual power
and rank among the world’s great dis-
coverers. They are not
They have more natural resources
than any other nation and they are
the only great people capable of pro-
ducing enough food to feed them-
selves”, , ' —

In conclusion he said, “These peo-
ple who have been sleeping on these

natural resources have at last awoke
,1n the greatest movement the world

has known for over 1,000 years. T'his
movement marks the beginning of a
new era for the whole world.”

Previous to -the address by Dr. Bible
short but emphatic speeches ‘were
made by T. G. Quick, "13, on Y. M. C.
A._.work and R. H. Vl/ettacli, ’l3. on
student enthusiasm and the football
banquet. ‘ -.
