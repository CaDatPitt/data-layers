To Speak
On Crime

Bill Sands, author of My ‘
Shadow Ran Fast, will speak .
at Wednesday’s Student Un-
ion Board Midday Series at
noon at the‘ Student Union

C Ballroom. His topic will be

 ‘p.li1. in"the SU Lower Lounge.

“The Third Step,” .a discussion of
the causes and cures for crime. '

Although born of wealthy and
inﬂuential parents,‘ Sands took ‘
to crime, and at the age of 19
was sentencedto prison. One of
his cellmates was Caryl Chess-
man, a murderer‘ sentenced to
death, who became famous for
his series of reprieves which
stretched out over a ten-year per-
iod. Chessman was ﬁnally exe-
cuted despite a raging controver-
sy’ over capital punishment.

It was while Sands was in San
Quentin Penitentiary for armed
robbery that he underwent .a com-
plete rehabilitation. He under-
took a program of self- study
which eventually helped him to
earn a parole in 1943.

After his release, Sands served .
in World War II, and was sub-
sequently a night club‘ entertain-

‘ er, professional prize ﬁghter, race

car driver, pilot, jungle explorer,
and businessman. ' \

Sands, who was originally
scheduled to speak at the Univer-
sity last winter, has become well-
known for his rehabilitation of
criminals and juvenile delin-
quents. “We are prone’ to treat
criminals as we do the common
cold,” he explained, “attaching
the symptoms rather than -the
cause.”

through such periods of ﬁnancial

“When a business goes into a

explained.

the need to introduce budgetary

controls,” he explained. _
According to Dr. Kurtzman,

the University’s ﬁnancial situa-

tion received both local and na-
tional publicity because of "Penn-
sylvania’s peculiar method of ii-
nancing higher education.”
Unlike most states, private and
state schools are not strictly sep-

arate. Pennsylvania provides aidl

forprivate universities, and “it is
those state-aided schools,” here-
marked, “who send the best bar:
gainers, who are usually able to
obtain the most aid.”

“When we submitted our pecu-

‘ liar request and received a ﬁnan-

cial investigation,” he added, “the
University could not avoid public
issue. In reality, though, such
state committee investigations
are considered routine for state
schools.” ’ ,

Dr. Kurtzm-an noted that the
state realizes’ the ‘difficulties of
such a system and is awaiting
the drafting of a. new aid pro-
gram to' be submitted to the State
Council for Higher Education.

A   I int
Eager FUCHS .
Student Government (SG)
passed a bill creating a sen-
ate Appropriations Commit-
tee to allocate activities fee
funds and elected ﬁve stu-
dents to the Committee dur-

ing a three. hour meeting

Thursday evening.
The bill, passed by accala-
mationand signed by Presi-

dent Eric Stern, established

a committee of ﬁve under-
graduate students with the Vice-
Chancellor of Student Affairs as
chairman. The Vice-Chancellor
may appoint a representative to
act in her absence.

Elected to the Committee were:
Dorrie Brand, Jim Smith, Bob
Farrington, Bob Mross, and

Charles Hollander. The bill was

sponsored by Senators John Rus-
kay, Richard Shweder, Marcia
Bernstein, Gerald Rosen, Charles

Hollander, Martin Engels, and

Jim J anies.

The resolution amended a bill
that SG passed last April, giving
SG control over the allocation of
activities fee funds. The April
bill still remained legal although
President Stern had vetoed it in
favor of -a_ compromise’ with the
Student Affairs Committee later
that month. The‘veto was void
since _the bill had not been re-

turned to the senate for reconsi-

deration.

Stern did return the Appropri-
ations Committee Bill passed two
weeks .ago to the senate for re-
consideration. The bill provided

for two members of the Commit- -

tee to be selected by SG and two
by the Student Affairs Commit-
tee. It was defeated 21 to 1 after
Senator Richard Shweder assured
students that Vice-Chancellor of
Student Affairs Helen Rush was

such a committee would prob-

ably not require the approval of
the Board of Trustees.

He pointed out that the Board
had established the fee to be ad-
ministered by a special commit-
tee of students, without speciﬁca-
tion of selection. However, SG
Vice-President Hogan later com-

ﬂmented that while the Board's

resolution did not state the Com-
mittee’s composition, the original
student recommendation of the
fee, which the Board adopted,
stipulated an SG-Student Affairs-
selected Committee. There fol-

Fight for Better Society 

Liberals Form New Organization

By ALEX DTPPOLITQ

A plea for workers to radically
change society went out at
Wednesday’s organizational meet-
ing, of the New Student Left.

Ross Danielson, former editor‘
of Ideas and Figures and grad-
uate student in‘ sociology, ex-
plained to the 70 students and
observers thatthe purpose of the
meeting was to inform students
of projects underway and to re-
cruit active workers for them.
“Anyone not interested in work-
ing,” Danielson invited, “may
leave now.”

The New Student Left, Daniel. I

son said, is the left which “FDR
ushered out.” When Roosevelt
campaigned for the presidency he
said that “one third of America
is ill-housed, A ill-fed, ‘ and ill-cloth-
ed,” said Danielson, and added
that “this is still true.” -This is
the reason that “We want to
radically change society,” hesaid.
Joe Centifanti, liberal arts
(LA) junior, acting as chairman
of the meeting said that the pur-

pose of the group was “to bring

    

information together and to form
-an action committee.” The group
will maintain an informal status
and would not operate as a group
per se but would act as a clear-
ing house for Liberal activities
on and about campus.’
Individuals representing vari-
ous campus activities or with
projects to sell addressed the
meeting, soliciting support for
their projects. Mat Simon, grad-
uate student in chemistry, ex-
plained that the Students Organ-

ization Committee had organized

the Progressive Neighbors’ Union
which is attempting to _organize
community “block clubs.” The
purpose of these clubs is to serve
as pressure groups, better the
community, and bring -about
change‘ in the social and political
structure of the community.‘
Simon's group is also lobbying
in the state legislature for Sen-
ate Bill 813, which would legalize

4 rent strikes. A tenant would pay

his rent into an escrow fund un-

til the landlord’ repaired his"
building’.  3 '

  

The Union meets at’St. Paul’s
House of Prayer, 1800 Webster
Ave. every Monday evening at
7930. .

Marcie McNut, LA senior, des-
cribed the work of the two and
one-half year, old Hill Education
Project (HEP) of which she is co-
chairman. She labeled the pro-
gram a “reciprocal growth pro-
cess” in which the tutor goes into
the Hill District and the tutee
comes to the campus so that each
can gain the experience of “cer-
tain parts of another world.”
of Irv Gafﬁnkle, 1965 graduate,
urged a picket and a boycott of
the King's Court, the new Forbes
Ave. theater. The action is neces-
sary, Garﬁnkle argued because
the theater “charges $2.50 on
weekdays, $3 on. the weekend.
and has hired a non-unio pro-
jectionist.” “Three dollars is out-
rageous," he said.

“A lot of you think this is a
joke,” said Garﬁnkle indefending
his proposal, “but this is the way

forstudents to get power. It does-

Creation of an all-purpose stu-

according to Marty Engels, Stu-,7

“Enough work has been done-
so that next year there is_a very.

Engels. ’ ‘

The idea for the I.D. card orig;

A “Permanent Picketing Com- '
mittee, whether it be the theater
or Vietnam” was suggested from‘
the floor by John Ruskay, LA
sophomore. The group would be
able to supply pickets should the
need arise. A suggestion by a co-
ed to form even more cominittees
for other liberal causes was met
with agreement by Centifanti
and Garﬁnkle.

Twenty: ﬁve students signed
cards indicating a willingness to
work for the liberal goals out-
lined. These people had accept-
ed Garﬁnkle’s challenge to work
instead of being the type of stu-
dent who would “walk out of the

back and calling himself a liber-y

of sorority acceptances is being
considered by the Panhellenic
Council. When» .a proposal, is
clearly formulated, it will be de-
cided upon by the Dean of Wom-

With an increased quota larger

rector of the physical plant, be-

ity staff cannot “operate under a
policy of having one’s cake and
eating it too.” Because of the
current ﬁnancial crisis, Captain
Fisher’s staff has lost ﬁve or six
men, and “the quality of“ Uni-
versity security has naturally suf-
fered. ' .-
“However, no one has been

was no reasonable solution for
the problem.

“Salaries in our department
will remain the same,” Fisher
said, “.and increases are unlikely
at this time. The future is look-
ing good. But one never knows.
The University may recover in

take one or two years, perhaps
even more.”

“I would not be concerned if
we went state,” he added, “be—

    

cause many state schools have

fewer restrictions upon them
than the state-aided universities.

According to Dr. Kurtzman, the
Board of Trustees -feel that the
University’s problems are over
for the coming year. The Univer-

‘sity will ask for an increase in

state ‘aid next year and hope to
receive greater contributions from
the community. Our alumni sup-
port, however, is poor compared
to that of other universities.’’

In closing, he said that theVUni-
versity hopes to project a new
image to satisfy its three major
clientele: the students,—the fac-
ulty and the state and communiy.
Part of the new image would be
showing the University’s concern
with frugality, especially by keep-

ing ‘ administrative expenditures‘

at a minimum “even if we have
to give up a few parties.” Dr.
Kurtzman, did .add, however,
that the academic standards of

the‘ All-Men’s average after a
brief. period of ascendency in the

1 winter of ‘1963,

The All-Fraternity annual aver-

_-ll.» age for 1964-65 was 2.387, whle
 the All-,Men’s was 2.409. How-
"" ever, there were four fraternities

which recorded averages higher

' than 2.5 for .at least one trimes-

ter last year, and will receive
the Academic Honors award from
the‘7Dean' of Men. These were
Alpha Phi Alpha (winter), Delta

 Tau Delta (fall), Phi Epsilon Phi
' (winter), and Sigma Alpha Mu

(fall, winter).

The pledge classes did not far:
as well and only one pledge class,
Phi Epsilon Pi, was able to main-
tain a 2.5 average or better in
both the. fall and winter trimes-
ters. ' s

The Dean of Men’s Office also

having the highest chapter «aver-

Is the YF-12A the world's fastest manned aircraft?

(Maj. Daniel, a test pilot since I 954, is trmember
of the Society of Experimental Test Pilots. He
received -a B.S. degree in Aeronautical Engineering
from the University of Oklahoma. In -February
I 962, he set world class time-to-climb records in a

Capableof speeds better than 2,000 mph,
the YF-12A is the hottest aircraft around. .
Now Maj. Walter F. Daniel, test pilot for the YF-12A,
answers your questions about the world’s fastest
manned airplane and America’s Aerospace/Team.

It certainly is. On May 1 of this year the YF-12A

(formerly known as the A-1 l) reclaimed the world
absolute speed record from the USSR. It was
clocked at 2,062 mph over Edwards Air Force Base.

not Big is the YF-12A? I
The exact dimensions of the YF-12A have not been

released yet..But it's approximately 100 feet long,
with about a 50-foot wingspan. That's half again

as big as our present interceptors!

Is the Air Force training many men
5 as pilots these ‘days?

Yes, very deﬁnitely. In spite of all you hear about
unmanned vehicles, the human pilot is still very
much in the picture. As a matter of fact, the_Air
Force pilot quota is on the increase.’ I

What other kinds of jobs does the Air Force offer?

Since it's one of the world's foremost technological
organizations, the Air Force has plenty of openings
for scientistsiand engineers. There are also many
challenging and varied administrative-managerial

positions. -

Air- Force officer. The new two-year Air Force
ROTC program makes this method available to
men who have already completed, a year or two of
their college education. For college graduates, if
you did not take advantage of ROTC, you ca_n
still get started through Air Force Officer Training
School (OTS), a three-month course open to both
men and women.

Can I keep up my studies while
I’m in the Air Force?
The Air Force‘ encourages its men and women to
continue their educations. For instance, you may
qualify to study for a graduate degree during_otf-
duty hours, with the Air Force paying a substantial
part of the tuition. ”

What kind of future do I have in the Air Force?

A bright one. As we move further into the Aero-
space Age, the Air Force is going to grow even
more, important. And you can grow with it!

A Poverty War In Practice

The press has been saying that Sargent
Shriver and his “war on poverty” are in
trouble. Shriver retaliates with the claim
that the press “tends to magnify the diffi-
cultiesand ignore the accomplishments” of
the program. Shriver can defend himself by
quoting facts and ﬁgures: 600,000 children
took part in Operation Headstart; 300,000
youths are enrolled in the neighborhood
Youth Corps, etc. But how
much can we_ learnfrom
such ﬁgures? Was Operation
Headstart a success? Did it
, really help the children? The
answer can not be found in
publicized factual accounts
of the program. By its very
.nature, its results will be
hard to measure. One way to
. , answer such questions is
from personal experience. .

As an assistant teacher in a Headstart
Program this summer, I had the opportun-
ity to see how much the program helped the
children in our class. The purpose of the
eight week summer program was to better
prepare four and ﬁve year olds for kinder-
garten or ﬁrst grade.’ Many children from

 

 “disadvantaged homes” have had very lim-

lted experiences; for example, they may
have never been more than a block away
from home or may not know how to use
crayons or paints. Their lack of simple ex-
periences which most people take for grant-
ed may cause them to feel inferior when
they first come to school‘. They become
ashamed of theirignorance and react with
hostility toward the new environment. If
they fail to adjust they eventualy become
high school dropouts. The purpose of the
program was to help the children adjust to
school more easily. _

WHEN THE 15 children in our class
arrived, there were many surprises for me.

Sheltered in a middle-class environment, I 

had never known a child who did not have
decent clothes to wear to school. It really
disturbed me to see one of the boys (Don-
ald) come to school without any underwear,
with pants so baggy that he could hardly
keep them up, and a pair of sneakers (no
socks) which were too small and had only
one shoelace. And then came the time when
the same good-natured child missed school
for three days because he could not ﬁnd his
sneakers, the only pair of shoes he owned.

. It took me a while to become familiar
with the situations of 'many of -the mother-

By Nancy Fuchs

' ory is that of Robin—-a little girl who was

losing her front tooth. “Have your father
pull it out for you,” I started to say, stop-

ping myself as I realized her father was in ,

prison. “Have yourmother pull it out,” I
said instead. She did not utter a word. As
she went out, I suddenly recalled that her
mother had disappeared the weekend be-
fore. '

 

Besides Donald and Robin, Cindy re- 
mains in my mind. She was a tiny child’

with short straight brown hair, big brown
eyes, and a mouth that she rarely opened.
The teacher and the other assistant thought
she was almost non-verbal. She rarely said
a-word and would not do anything unless a

teacher took her by the hand. The other ‘

children called her “the baby” although she
‘was as old as the rest. Gradually we learned
that she did not have a father, her mother
was over-protective, and her brother, a. car-
bon copy of «Cindy, was her only playmate.
CHILDREN WHO could not put a‘sim-
ple puzzle together in the beginning mas-
tered the most difficult ones later. Donald
became enchanted with story telling and lis-
tened to ‘tape recordings of nursery rhymes
by the hour. Chuck stopped hanging on the
teacher all day and began to play with the

“me.” Clyde’s behavior improved and he set-
tled down to making puzzles and painting:

But the biggest change of all occured.1n
Cindy. Strangely enough she came alive.
during the daily toothbrushing ritual at the
bathroom. One day she suddenly started
giggling and chattering to the other girls,
admiring herself in the mirror, commenting
on all the people passing by the window, and
taking great interest in the light SW1tChe_S
and pipes in the bathroom. It was a tremen_
dous experience to see this happen to a child
who had barely opened her lips for three
weeks, never siniled, or expressed any emo-
tion. Gradually she learned to play with the
other children and do things for herself. She
still had a long way to go,_but had taken a
big step in the right direction.

The results of the ﬁrst batch of tests
were discouraging since nearly all of the
IQ’s were well below normal, but almost
everyone improved greatly on the second

set which was given the last week. Cindy’s'

score skyrocketed. _ _

The changes which we observed in the
children’s behavior - and accomplishments
~and.the improved test results made us feel
that the program: had indeedbeen a success.

Mistakes Cost,
Gridders Win

By TOM SACKS
In Saturday’s 17-15 loss
to Oregon, ‘ the Panthers
were afflicted by a simple
case of over anxiety with the

' acutest attacks coming with-

in 10 yards of the end’ zone.

Twice in the last quarter the
gridders had the ball on the Ore-
gon ' six yard line with three
downs at their disposal. One
drive was killed by a fumble and
the other by an intercepted pass.

In the second quarter symp-
toms of what was. going to strike
the gridders when under pressure.
was evident. Safetyman Tippy
Pohl had recovered an Oregon
fumble on the Duck 20. "

Kenny Lucas passed to Bob
Longo for an 11 yard gain, Bob-
by Dyer carried the hall over
right tackle down to the ﬁve.
Three plays later the Panthers
were back on the 15 yard line.
Jim Jones came in to attempt a
ﬁeld goal. The pass from center
was high and the attempt for
three points never got off the
ground.

Such mistakes combined with
the close score made for an ex-
citing game, yet also dropped
Panther spirits and’ overshadow-
ed individual performances“ ’

Senior Eric Crabtree was ‘the
standout of the game. He gained
64 yards rushing onill attempts
for a 5.8 average. He was also
at the receiving end of two pass-
es which covered 91... yards. On
three kickoff returns Crabtree
raced the ball back a total of 125
yards. ‘ ’

On those three returns only
one m.an stood between the speed-
ster and a clear ﬁeld, due to the
blocking up front.

Quarterback Kenny Lucas has
finally provided the gridders
with a potent scoring threat from
anywhere on the ﬁeld. His arm
provided the rallying point in the
first half after the Oregon line-
backers began keying on the run-
ning game, especially Barry Mc-
Knight.

Lucas gained 229 yards through
the air despite‘ only completing
12 of 29 attempts. In both scor-
ing drives a pass play had set
the. gridders up close to the goal
line. .

In the second quarter with the

“Panthers on their 20 yard line,

Lucas hooked up with Crabtree

“for a 41 yard gain. End Mitch

Zalnasky caught two more for 22
yards and a crucial ﬁrst down.
From there Dyer carried it in
on two plays.

The key play in the other
scoring drive was a 43 yard pass
play to Dyer which placed the
"Panthers on the Duck nine yard
line. Two plays later Dyer on the
halfback option tossed the ball
to Zalnasky in the end zone for-
the score.

That same Play backﬁred only
one minute later when the grid-
ders were again in scoring posi-

tion on -the Duck seven. Dyer’s
option pass _wobbled ‘right into
the hands of Oregon’s Jim Smith.

In practice the coaches had
been stacking the defense in
hopes of opening up the breaks
for the offense. The inexperi-
enced offensive line held up ade-
quately with the aid of Me-
Knight's blocking from the‘fu1l-'
back position. _

It was the defense in the third
quarter when the‘ Ducks scored
their two touchdowns that seem-

ed to fall apart. Oregon's signal '

caller, Tom Trovato, apparently
was cashing in on something his
coaches had noticed in the first
half. Trovato’s bread and butter
play during the 72 and 87 yard
drives was the quarterback roll-
out option. -

For some reason a void was

left in the Panther pass defense
on the short down and outs.
Sophomore starter Chip Rife who
was having trouble covering Ray
Palm, Oregon's best end, was re-
placed midway through ‘the third
quarter.

Anchoring down the defense
was Pohl, Jim Flanigan and left
tackle Robert Guzinsky. Pohl was
all over the ﬁeld, coming up with
one fumble and an interception.
Flanigan was stacking up the right
side of the line, making numer-
ous key tackles. Guzinsky held to-
gether the left side of the de-
fensive line.

The sophomores who started
in Saturday’s opener made more
than their fair share of mental
errors. “It gaire them their share
of experience, however,” said
coach John Michelosen.

Disaster struck the Yogi “ex-
perts" of The Pitt News. Only

rash of opening day college foot-
ball upsets. “The Log” correctly

Soccer

 

Complete domination "of the thirdquarter brought the
soccer team its opening victory, a 3-0 shutout of Frostburg
State College at heat baked Kennard Fieldilast Saturday.

In the third quarter, the booters did what they didn’1
do throughout the first half. They began to weave and shoot
the short passes to the right and left wings, instead of kick-
ing right at Frostburg’s goalie or easy enough so that the
goalie had plenty of time to stop the threat. K

Practically all the action of that period took place in

Frostburg’s half of the ﬁeld as
the soccermen really ,applied the
pressure, outshooting the opposi-
tion, 11 to 0. As the booters kick-
ed shot after shot, the Frostburg
players looked like they had giv-
en _up the cause. And from the
bench, Kenneth Babcock, Frost-
burg’s coach hollered.

“They’ve (Pitt) got everyone
down there now except they’re
fullbacks, and if you don’t watch
out, they'll have their goalie on
you.”

Two of the shots in the qua_rter
hitpaydirt. Pet Snyder, a sopho-
more right-winger, stuck one in
the nets just as Frostburg’s goalie,
senior Bob Sutton, dived‘ for the
ball. The other came on a pen-
alty shot. Coach Leo Bemis se-
lected ‘Cal Bonawitz to do the
honors and he promptly booted
the ball over Sutton’s outstretch-
ed hands in the upper right cor-
ner ofpthe nets.

With an_ assist from Dave Shaf-
fer, Gary Foertisch, another
sophomore, insured victory in the
ﬁnal stanza of play. Sneaking be-
tween ' three players, Foertsch

_ eased the ball pass the goalie for

the third score of the game.

Although the soccerzteam had
opportunities to score in the ﬁrst

, half, nobody could put that ball

in the nets. The best chance came
on a penalty shot, but Al Traun—

steiner, a left winger, who usu.a1- »

1y kicks to the right of the goalie,

We

had his attempt to the left block-
ed. ‘

After the blocked shot’, Bab-
cock, who had something to say
-after every play, turned around
to face his team and remarked,
“foranybody who could kick at
all, a penalty shot should be au-
tomatic.”

Assistant coach Bob .McNulty
attributed the booters’ slow start
to the ﬁrst game jitters, but Be-
mis blamed it on the ﬁeld condi-
tions which remained the same
throughout the game.

“In the heat and excitement of
the first game, the players found
trouble -with theldust and the
hot sun. And also, instead of us-

ing short passes, they kicked too —

much. This resulted in much of
the ﬁrst half action being played
in mid-ﬁeld,” Be‘rnis»said..

The only time Frostburg threat-
ened was in that confused first
half. And then, they were stop-
ped before they reached the goal
by the defensive fullbacks, Art
Richardson, Jim Cuddy, and Bon-.
awitz.

Richardson, who continuously
stopped opponents at the mid-
field line, booted the ball high
and far downﬁeld whenever a
Frostburg forward approached
scoring territory. Many times, he
would avert a drive;‘then lead

“Frostburg could never sustain

said Bemis. “Richardson and Cud-

and for the Frostburg players,
this became very disconcerting.”
