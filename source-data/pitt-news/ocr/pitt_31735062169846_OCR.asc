Legislative red tape in Harris-
burg and an apparent lack of com-
munication between University‘
officials and Oakland property
owners are delaying plans for
Pitt’s graduate school complex.

The Pitt News learned this re-
cently in a series of interviews

with Oakland real estate owners. 1

merchants and University author-
ities. \

Edison Montgomery, the Uni-
versity’s vice chancellor of fi-
nance, told the Pitt News in No-
vember that the block which in-

cludes Binstock s, Henry-Henry’s.
and the new McDonalds Ham-
burger store. along with the Civ-
ic Center Motel and the new
Stuckert gas station. would ‘be

.condemned soon by the General

State Authority (GSA ).

Montgomery added that plans
calledfor these buildings to be
razed by Jan. 1. 1970. He said that
the Graduate School of Library
Sciences. the School of Social
Sciences. and the School of Ed-
ucation would be constructed on
this site. But Elmer Stuckert, the
gas station owner, and Jim Deli-
gatta, McDonald’s area head.
claimed to have no knowledge of
definite plans.

   

As of last week, condemnation
notices for buildings on the grad-
uate school site had not been is-
sued. Vice Chancellor Montgom-
ery didn’t know why. “For the
life of us,” said Montgomery,
“we don’t know why they (GSA)
hasn’t sent these notices.”

Montgomery then called Hunt-
ington Martin. the University's
director of the physical plant.
Martin told Montgomery that for
the GSA to move officially and
legally, a piece of paper has to
move from the Governor’s office
to the GSA.‘

Although legislation for the
graduate school buildings has

. been approved. the piece of paper

Dec. 6, 7968, edition of The Pitt News, a Dec. 13 letter to the.FAS .,om
T‘ Provost Charles Peake, a Dean Halliday letter published in Monday's
issue, and Associate Provost J. Steel Gow’s Wednesday's statement con-

cerning ROTC.

Editor, The Pitt News A
In a statement circulated Wednesday, Associate Provost J.
Steel Gow, Jr. attempted to clarify the haziness surrounding the
recent decision by Dean David Halliday to extend ROTC cred-

it “for those students current-

. 1y enrolled in the basic course.”

The Associate Provost’s state-
ment presents the history of
events eventually culminating in

the Peake-Halliday decision. In

mid-December. according to the
Gow statement. Provost Peake de-
cided “that students presently en-
rolled in ROTC would receive
credit for both the basic and the
advanced course, in accordance
with the policy that existed at the

‘time of the entry into the pro-

gram.

 In Gow’s words, “a student who

 

entered the basic ROTC courses
in September, 1968." by defini-
tion of’ the Peake-Halliday deci-
sion. “would be authorized to
complete with credit the full four
year program." '

Before this mid-December de-
cision, Dr. Peake was reported in
the Dec. 6 issue of The Pitt News
to be reportedly upset by the Fac-
ulty of the College of Arts and

Sciences" (FAS) decision to dis-
credit ROTC. At that time, Dr.
Peake didn’t think the FAS vote
was a representative decision, ac-
cording to a reliable source.

Reacting to the Dec. 6. 1968.

page one story in The Pitt News,

Dr. Peake circulated a statement.
Dec. 13 to all the members of the
FAS. “I should like to correct the
false impression conveyed by The
Pitt News article of Dec. 6 that
the administration was planning
to ‘void’ the vote of the FAS.re-
garding credit for ROTC courses. "

The Provost. in his Dec. 13 let-
ter. repeated his affirmation of
the jurisdiction of the FAS‘ con-
cerning the elimination of ROTC
credit along the lines of the FAS
resolution. “The decision of the
FAS stands,” wrote Dr. Peake.
“and neither the Chancellor nor I
have. or had. any intention of
‘voiding’ it.” .

Nevertheless, the mid-Decem-"
ber Peake-Halliday decision was

“strictly on the grounds of equity
and fairness to our students. Ina
letter to the Undergraduate Coun-
cil, Dean Halliday reaffirmed
this position. .

“It has always been our policy
that. when changes in academic
programs are made, they are not
imposed upon a student who has
embarked on an earlier program

Louis E. Averback is the real es-
tate agent who represents the
owners of the buildings housing
Binstock’s second floor, McDon-

Card Store, and a coin laundry.

Averback called University con-
struction plans. “just a lot of con-
versation. They’ve been talking
about this for four years. They
keep threatening, but there have
been no negotiations so far.” He
added that he has heard’ nothing.

by Jim Grossman, one participant
in the program. Although he ad-
mitted to hesitancy about attend-
ing, Grossman found the lab to be
a “fascinating experience.”

Grossman observed that trivial
conversation served as a protec-
tive barrier for the individuals.
He also found intellectualization
to be another defense mechanism
frequent in conversation.

Developing a rapport with peo-
ple throughmutual trust was the
goal Grossman felt the session was
attemping to achieve. He felt that
this was a difficult aim to accom-

student events, he is entertainment chair-
man, director of finance, and a member of
the University Social Committee. His work
has brought him into contact with various
administrators, and has g iv e n him a
“sense of fulfillment.”

His greatest personal satisfaction has
come from his work as entertainment
chairman because “it’s something ful-
filling to see 3800 happy people in the
Syria Mosque. I feel that I really accom-
plished a lot by getting some really good
entertainment for our concerts. We’ll have
the Chamber’s Brothers here for Winter
Weekend and they’ll be just about the best
concert ever. When we had Dionne Warwick
for the Homecoming concert, we had come
a long way from my freshman year when
the concert was in the Commons Room.”

The small town boy who has come to the.

big city, Lenny is impressed with Pitts— -

burgh. He enjoys the city because it is

unique —— it’s unlike any other major city. ~

The one part that doesn-’t appeal to him is
the traffic. “I never knew things could be
so bad,” he explained. “Every time you
cross the street you take you-r life into
your hands.”

Besides being one of the reformers in
the social side of college life, Lenny has
worked hard on the Student Power issue
and has some very definite ideas about
student rights. “There’s lots of room for
change here. Scheuler woke up the student
body, but Pitt still has a problem, be it ath-
letic, administrative or racial. They’re try-
ing now but they can’t stop yet.”

“Students have to get involved,” he
went on. “Those people in the Cathedral
aren’t just going to give us things, we
have to make demands. We-should have
student representation on all academic
matters. We shouldn’t have to get approv-
al for everything we do. When we first!
asked power to allocate student funds,
people were horrified. Trust students with
$150,000? Never! Now no one even thinks
about it.” I

By student representation on faculty-
committees, he didn’t mean 50-50. The
committees that dealt with athletics and
social problems, however, should have a
student—faculty ratio of one to one.

He is quite happy with his time here
and will never regret coming here to
school —

that had to be done — just a job.”

“Most people who believe in
God have no clear conception of
what they mean because they
just know synonyms,” said phil-
osopher Walter, Kaufmann in a
speech given last Tuesday in
Langley Hall.

These synonyms include words
like “supreme being,”
“creator.”
God as a supreme being Dr. Kauf-
mann explained that this was a
strange concept that must be
looked at historically.’

“In the Iliad, Homer ranks the
most beautiful woman, the best

explained Dr. Kaufmann.

“There is something not re-
spectable about denying God’s
existence,” said Dr. Kaufmann.
He went on to compare the village
atheist to the village idiot and
added that “people like John Fos-
ter Dulles and Dwight Eisenhower
have in the past associated athe-
ism with Communism.”

Dr. Kaufmann stressed the
idea that the words ‘ “theism”
and “atheism” are not really ac-
curate descriptive terms. He feels
that these words are heavily
charged with emotion where the
theist is depicted as being good
and the atheist is depicted as
being bad.’

Kaufmann said, “It is a way of
not believing without hurting
mother or father or placing one-
self in an intellectually tenable
position.”

By quoting statistics Dr. Kauf-
mann revealed the hypocrisy
most Americans have in regard
to religion. He said ‘that “83% of
Americans believe that the Bible
is the revealed word of God, yet
50% of them admitted to the fact
that they had read very little or
none of it and over half couldn't
even name one gospel.”

He went on to say that “since

discussions about God occur in a-

social context against an histor-
ical background, terms concern-
ing God become heavy with child-
hood associations. By saying that
one believes one is merely de-
claring a loyalty to tradition and
atheism seems to deny the want
of sustaining a continuity of the
loyalty to one’s parents, grand-
parents, etc.”

Dr. Kaufmann believes that the
phrase “God exists” is a ritual-
ly ambiguous assertion because
God does not seem to exist like
other things do. “Exists” refers
neither to a spatial existence nor
a non—spatial existence, like

Dr. Kaufmann also rules out

Throat Stuffing

Former National Security Advisor
McGeorge Bundy once wrote that in the
university community the faculty,

 not the administration or the students,

constitutes the most influential seg-
ment of the tri-partate family.

The Bundy thesis is terribly innac-
curate at the University of Pittsburgh.

I .Like the students at this institution,

the faculty hassubmitted to the benign

C despotism of our’ seemingly techno-

cratic administration.

In May, 1968, the University’s Fac-
ulty Senate acted affirmatively on
the demands of the Black Action Soci-
ety. At that time University officials
promised quick implementation, of
the demands. The implementation was
carried out with such speed that the

:1 , BAS staged a sit-in last month at the

University’s $15 million Computer
Center. This action awakened the Uni-
versity hierarchy to “get moving.”
But faculty‘ pressure, on this issue,
was seemingly ignored or simply “out
of the pragmatic question.”

The ROTC issue, however, provides
the clearest example of faculty insig-
nificance in University governance.
In the Spring the Faculty Senate Com-

~ mittee on Organization and Proced-

ures recommended that academic
credit for ROTC courses be eliminat-
ed.

The Committee submitted their res-

I . A olution to the Academic, Cabinet of the

Arts and Sciences. The student cabinet
substantially agreed with the Faculty
Senate committee’s findings, and also
recommended the removal of ROTC

« credit.

The matter was then referred to
the Undergraduate Council. After ‘a
balanced presentation of argument the
Council voted to remove ROTC credit.
All of this faculty-student action was
deemed “unrepresentative” in ad-
ministrative "eyes.

The question of lack of representa-
tion was seemingly resolved when the
Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences

" called the first meeting of the Faculty_

of the College of Arts and Sciences

A . ’ (FAS). The FAS resolution, for all con-
 cerned, was to be the final vote and de-
' ciding factor in the ROTC controversy.

These administrative assurances

‘to the faculty were covertly altered

By HARRIS MILLER
Staff News Writer
Last week, in h-is first major press con-
ference since assuming office. President
Nixon answered a question put to him by

an interested reporter concerning the lev-

el of our nuclear strength with the word
“sufficient." This rather ambiguous word

. _ was well taken for a while. but now quite

a few high ranking Washington officials

‘are beginning to won-
.» der exactly how Mr.

at an intellectual uni-
versity would be un-
willing to accept such
a ridiculous response
from their chancellor-
-or would they? Let us

 

turn to such a univer-

sity. the University of Airplane, where,

 

when the FAS surprisingly voted 106-
84 to remove academic credit from the
ROTC program. The Dec. 4 resolution
aid: “I hereby move that this faculty
award no academic credit for ROTC
courses, except that any student cur-
rently enrolled in either a basic or ad-
vanced program may complete that
program with credit as currently
granted.” I

That resolution was summarily
weakened by the mid-December Peake-
Halliday decision, which allows cadets
now enrolled in the basic course to
take the advanced course with full
academic credit. This decision was
made about two weeks after the FAS
vote without ample consultation _of
the faculty. - »

The Peake—Halliday move prosti-
tutes the ideals of this University.
It is an administrative ruling bas-
tardizing the gist of the FAS resolu-
tion. And the decision commits this

grievous sin without even suggesting _

a faculty vote, on this very academic

‘matter. Is the status of faculty at

this University commensurate with
that of a content puppet?

This new brand of administrative
throat-stuffing is an outrage. Time
and time again, the administration
by-passes faculty rights with admin-
istrative rulings.

Associate Provost J. Steele Gow
rationalizes this latest move on the
wheel of administrative usurpation on
the basis of “fairness and equity.”
But is it fair, is it equitable to usurp
the basic right of this institution’s

faculty? Is it democratic to shove

castrating administrative ' rulings in
the faces of the faculty? ~ ‘

In this case, the administration
has gone too far. The Pitt News de-
mands that the integrity of our fac-
ulty be reaffirmed by at least putt'ing
the Peake-Halliday decision up to a vote
by the FAS. We also ask Dean Halliday
or the office of the Provost to make
public a statement of intent. '

The issue of faculty significance in
University governance is one of mo-

mentous proportions. If the adminis- '

tration keeps its clamp down on the
faculty and the students, the time is
ripe for dramatic action.

 

 

By DAVID ROSENBLUM
Staff Columnist

The funniest question I have ever been
asked was posed by the Director of Student
Publications. During a discussion she look-
ed at me and asked,

“Why don’t you believe anything the
administration tells you?”

I chuckled and answered. “Why should
I?" ..
“You mean you don't

believe ANYTHING they
say?” ’ ‘

“AS A GENERAL RULE
I try not to.”

Her question was a
particularly humorous
because she sounded so
sincere. She could not
understand my habit of
ranking every adminis- _
trative statement in the “fairy tale” cate-
gory. But I have my reasons, reasons that
have been founded upon the administra-
tion’s general tendency to lie right through
its teeth. —

 

RQSENBLUM

On December 13th of last year, Provost
Peake sent a brief letter to_ the members
of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences‘ dis-
claiming any effort by the administration
to void the faculty’s vote on ROTC accredi-
dation’. The last line reads. “The decision

of the FAS stands, and neither the Chancel- ‘

lor nor I have. or had, any intention of
‘voiding’ it.”

Then last week, in a stroke of genius,
Dean Halliday wrote a private letter say-
ing that he was extending credit to those
who were now enrolled in the basic ROTC
Courses; this went directly against the de-
cision of the faculty. Indeed, the first sen-
tence of his letter stated that he knew that
he was behaving" improperly, but because
of public pressure he was altering the de-
cision. in

AS COULD BE predicted, the adminis-
trative cover-up,came today when Steele
Gow, Associate Provost, tried to rectify
Halliday’s blunder. Gow claims that Peake
met with Dean Halliday shortly after the
faculty’s decision and they decided to alter
the decision by allowing the students now
enrolled in the basic program to receive
credit forthe advanced program. Peake’s
action was taken _so that the students now
-enrolled in the basic course would be treat-'
ed equitably.

. If this is true. then why did Peake write
that letter to the faculty members saving
that he had no intention of voidingthe de-
cision? And if the decision was so equit-
able. why did Halliday admit that he was
behaving improperly?

The ploy of using the American Legion
as a reason for extending credit is so much
bull. Dr. James Holland contacted a friend
of his who is a member of the state legis-
lature and asked him if the Legion could ex-
ert enough pressure on the legislature to
withhold money from the university. His
friend simply laughed. J

THIS ACTION WAS a first step by the ad:
ministration to unilaterally issue creditf_._§§~
back to ROTC. The faculty was never con-
sulted. The December issue of The Pitt News
intimated that the administration would
probably attempt to void the faculty’s
decision. Then came Peake’s letter, and
then Halliday’s letter, and then Gow’s
feeble excuse to cover it all up.

But the one question that keeps ringing

' in my mind is if the decision was made

in December, why wasn’t the.faculty ever
notified? V -

This is just one of m a n y instances
where the administration has been caught
with feathers on its mouth.

How can anyone expectme to trust a
Chancellor that never speaks before the A
students?

How can anyone expect me to trust an
administration that keeps files on fresﬁﬁe
man girls, files that contain everything
from their personal appearance to the peo-
ple they date?

And how can anyone expect me to trust

an administration that takes no action

even though it knows that there are FBI
agents on campus.

NO, THE TIME has longpassed when I’
could trust someone from the- administra-
tion. A person can only tolerate so many
lies and feigned ignorances. You can ac-
cuse me of being closed-minded, and you
will be right. Before I could ever believe .
anything from them. I would have to see?‘
some action; and at the moment, all I can
observe is Promised Action, and alltoo of-
ten that is just a pack of lies.

But maybe there is a change. coming.
Maybe the reversal of the faculty’s deci-
sion and the proof of campus agents was
the straw that broke the camel’s back,
Maybe there are, right now, a group of peo-
ple who are willing to put certain prin-
ciples on the line in the form of demon-
strable action.

I should like to correct the false impression conveyed 
by the Pitt News article of December 6 that the adminis- ,
tration was planning to “void” the vote of the Faculty of 
Arts and Sciencesregarding credit for ROTC courses.

I have repeatedly affirmed the jurisdiction of the 
FAS in this matter. The decision of the FAS stands, and 
neither the Chancellor nor I have, or had, any intention 
of “voiding” it.

RE: Implementation of FAS Resolution on ROTC Credits

In the absence of Provost Charles H. Peake and Dean Halli-
day, I wish to’ clarify certain aspects of implementation of the
FAS resolution on ROTC credit in the College of Arts and Sci-
ences. This appears to. be necessary to correct any misimpres-
sions that may have been created by the recent publication in the
Pitt News of a letter from Dean Halliday to members of the Un-
dergraduate Council of the College.

After the FAS adopted the resolution to end ROTC credit
toward a degree in the College, Provost Peake and Dean Halli-
day met and agreed that equity demanded that the resolution be
implemented in a manner that would not penalize -students al
ready enrolled in ROTC.- . ‘

Consultations with other FAS members confirmed that there 
-‘was sentiment, even among opponents of ROTC credit, against §
applying the resolution in way that would be retroactive in char _
acter. Provost Peake decided, therefore, that students.presently 
enrolled in ROTC would be allowed to receive credit for both 
the basic and the advanced course, inaccordance with the po
liey that existed at the time of their entry into the program.

Thus. a student who entered the basic ROTC course in Sep V
tember, 1968, would be authorized to complete with credit the 
ful-l four-year program. This decision was confirmed by the Pro '
vost in a note to Dean Halliday in mid-December, 1968.

I wish to emphasize that this interpretation was made by
the Provost shortly after the December 3 meeting of the FAS and ‘
was made strictly on the grounds of equity and fairness to our
’ ‘students. As Dean Halliday stated in another letter to the Under-

“graduate Council: "Ithas always been our policy ‘that, when
changes in academic programs are made, they not be imposed
upon a student who has embarked on an earlier program in good
faith."

Consequently, based upon these considerations and his dis-
cussions with the Provost, Dean Halliday conveyed to the._Un-
dergraduate Council the decision that Arts and Sciences students 
“currently enrolled in the basic program be permitted to contin
ue in the advanced program for credit should they wish to do so.
Students entering this fall, however, will receive no credit for the i
basic program or, should they go on, for the advanced program.”

Considerations of equity to students always have governed 
._ the University‘s practice in implementing program changes as, _
' for example, when the foreign language requirement, the course 
distribution requirement, and the undergraduate business admin- '
istration program were modified.

   
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
   
  
 
 
 
   
 
  
 

No resolution of the faculty. however interpreted, can re-
lieve the University of the moral obligation to fulfill, if feasible.
program commitments previously made to students already en-
rolled. ' i

It is most unfortunate that Dean Halliday’s note to the Un-
dergraduate Council was published without reference to other
communications that related to this matter and that would have
made the picture more clear. I trust that this memorandum will
now clarify the context in which the decision was made. Let me
reiterate, ‘then, that the method of implementation of the FAS
resolution on ROTC credit: —

(1) Is to be accomplished stricly on the grounds of equity to
students.

(2) Was decided long before any representation from organ-
izations or interests outside the University, and

      
     
 
 

    
 
 

(3) Is in no way affected or determined by any such outside
representation. Lest there be any doubt on "this point, I wish to
reaffirm the University’s long-standing -practice of deciding aca-
demic issues for itself on educational grounds.

   EDITORIAL POLICY

 

Editor, The Pitt News:

I am simultaneously chilled and
angered by the self—righteous
namecalling and innuendo of the
person in the letter by “A. Stu-
dent” who purports to be speak-
ing out against the “injustice”
perpetrated by the Black Action
Society against the white major-
ity at Pitt.

“A. Student” seems to have
trouble distinguishing BAS stu-
dents sitting-in from the non-
student teenagers who werefound
to be responsible for most of the
violence and destruction that

_took place on Wednesday. But_

‘then probably the trouble is that
all those colored people look alike.

Probably “A. Student” doesn’t
know anyone who belongs to the
BAS. He doesn’t know any black
people. That’s spelled P—E-O-P-L-E

“A. Student’s” analysis of the
Administration’s relationship to
the BAS makes me do a double-
take. I’d swear he’s complain-
ing, because the Administration
has notattempted to suppress a
legitimate student organization.

What’s that? The BAS is the
cause of allthat tension and un—_
rest? Come now, tell the whole
truth. Tell about .how restless,
and tense many whites get. when

I they see black -people together

and doing their own thing. Differ-‘
ent is dangerous. White is right.
Hush up and keep in line. .

It really sticks in my craw
when “A. ’Student” tries to hide
his blindness behind an attack
on the way black Pitt students
dress, walk, and dance. It’s a
trick that slave-owners used to
use to hide what they were do-

ing. The colored are quaint, but.
you know you can’t take “them”- .-

seriously. Funny about how that
slave-owner’s attitude hangs on.
But not very.

And finally “A. Student” is
upset at the injustice of the BAS
sit-in. It’s a fine technique to
get virtuous about the ‘unjust’
behavior of a ‘pampered’ minor-
ity.

But what about the massive in-
justice of a social system that
stacks the deck very cruelly
against a minority and then up-I
braids that minority for using
‘unjust means’ when it struggles

for its rights. And what about
the injustice of a society that,

hides from its own hangups by
belittling the minority’s human-
ity and refusing to take its’ prob-
lems seriously.

Look at both’ sides of the coin,
“A. Student” when you talk about
injustice. ’

I get the feeling that you real-
ly‘wouldn’t listen. to me, “A. Stu-
dent,” and that,if you saw. that

‘I was white, you’ would indict me

for being prejudiced against
whites, and ignore me.

3:W*********************t*Wl<*

So I guess I’m really talking to‘. H 
all those people who are still.  
open enough to listen for a little‘ '  .
while, but who are so shaken by  C
the Wednesday sit-in that they
forget the administrative inaction
that caused it and do not speak .
out firmly against the righteous. V I ii"

 

 

bigotry now showing through - 
the. rips in our student body’
clothing of gentility. ’ ‘

“A. Student” presents a thin-;
ly veiled threat of violence to
come. I ask those of you who
really believe in justice to join ‘A '
me in the self-searching neces-

‘ sary to find the compromisesin"

our own. consciences that have_
permitted us for so long to hide
from the true nature of our so-' , _
ciety. . 
And then I ask you totake ac- '
tion in your own way. How much
longer must black people be asked ,
to suffer because of ‘white. ped-.;.. 
ple’s disease. ' ' '

’t¢L'i<

Dear Mr. Galvin:

The trend on the nation's campuses is
toward greater freedom—and responsibility
—for the individual student. Whether the
action is extension of visiting hours for
women or relaxation of course
requirements, the result is the same:

a placing of greater trust in the

individual, and a growing array of

flexible alternatives for that individual.

Yet when he looks at business, and
particularly at big business, a student sees
an organization oriented to the group
rather than the individual, and to that
group's security rather than the
individual's challenge. That "group" is any
collection of administrative peers and .
immediate supervisors which meets _ .
frequently at all levels of the bureaucracy.

What began as an attempt to imitate the
highly successful "team" of technologists
has become a plodding group of
administrative bureaucrats. And whereas
the team produced, the group ponders.
But "group-think" is a strange brand

of thought indeed. Group-think places

a premium on affability rather than
creativity, and waste rather than
efficiency. Somehow, group-think
demands little or no substantive thinking
on the part of the individual. /

Lately, group-think has become
synonymous with business administration.
Some consulting firms exist merely to
sensitize the individual to.the group.

Yet administration has always been that _
aspect of business meant to appeal most
to a socially conscious college generation.
Is it any wonder then that the trend
toward individual freedom and
responsibility coincides with a growing
alienation towards business as a career?

Dear Mr. Klebanoff:

As a college student and member of
several important campus committees,
you must be aware of the importance of
individuals pooling ideas and efforts.
University-sponsored research programs
inquiring into needed social reforms. and
working out pilot projects as prototype
solutions—methods to overcome wide-
spread illiteracy in the ghettos; to
encourage self-respect through self-help,
for example—reflect team efforts. Even
actions undertaken by the dissenters and

The desire of young people for greater
individual freedom and responsibility is
not confined to the campus, but is a
characteristic of the maturing process.

It is not a phenomenon of this generation.
And it is a good thing when expressed
constructively. I

protesters on campus result from

"committee action" and not the blandish-
ments of one individual.

The concept of granting more and more

freedom to act responsibly, with

authority, is _not alien to business. ltis
fundamental. Individuals demonstrate
talents. Those talents need each other for
the attainment of composite results‘. In
the pooling there is no loss of indivi-
duality or freedom.

Business is, and must be, strongly

concerned with the individual, but since
running a business is a team effort. there
has to be group orientation, too.

In business, as in otherffields, many
decisions and actions result from
"group—think',’ meetings, which do indeed
demand substantive thinking from the ’
individual. It is my opinion that more
creative ideas come from a number of

people "thinking" together than

My question Mr. Galvin is what will

the opportunity—and incentive-—to
perform, as an individual, the kinds of
tasks he is both prepared and

anxious to perform?

Sincerely yours,
K 9.9.

Arthur Klebanoff

Government, Yale

I have attended many group-thinks but

I seldom one approaching your description.
Certainly some were unproductive . . .
but usually because of negligence in

 

separately. One person's ideas spark the
thinking of another; some people are
naturally better at conceiving the germ of
an idea than at refining it to a practical
degree. In a group-think cine draws upon
a multiplicity of talents _and viewpoints.

‘ development programs that are probing

' of our national progress. »

l

disciplining the group to adhere to the
subject. Carefully disciplined, no-nonsense
creative sessions often produce table-
bangings and heated exchanges rather
than affability . . . and out of them may
come solutions to complex problems and
decisions involving millions of dollars and -» 
affecting thousands of employees and the‘ »
public. An inefficient or conformist think
group would waste talents, manhours,

and money. A

Business is to blame for the fact that
today's college students must make a
critical choice between business and

other careers without sufficient knowledge
on which to base such a decision. .
Students daily exposed to the campus are
well-equipped with knowledge about \
teaching ; an abundance of facts on ,
medicine, government service, and many
other fields has long been available. But
business has neglected to communicate
adequately by way of personal experience.
the really significant facts about the
realities of business to the very people

it is trying to attract.

Its enormous accomplishments that have
produced the highest standards of living
in the world . . . its massive research and

into outer space and underseas. which
will profoundly affect virtually every facet
of man's life . . . _its increasing direct V
involvement in the social problems of
today, and the efforts to devise
practicable means of dealing with root
causes, not merely surface symptoms,

are all part of the daily operations

of business. a

The solutions being achieved result from
"group-think" efforts within-a ‘
corporation, oribetween a number of
businesses, or as the result of a
cooperative effort between business and
government. No one individual possesses
sufficient facts or knowledge to direct all
growth phases of a major enterprise. No
one sector of the economy has the
technical Know-how or resources to carry
the load for the continued forward thrust

Within this framework there are
"individual" selective tasks and goals
requiring "individual" responses. It is
through the intermingling of individual
talents that viable solutions to the
complex problems of today, and the-
challenges of tomorrow will be found.

Sincerely, -

Robert W. Galvin

also scored much higher than

ing their 160-152 loss to undefeat-

' The meet should prove very in-
teresting as there will be some
quite good performers in the floor
exercise event for both teams. The
varsity will show Lowell Meek,
who ‘has not been defeated this
season and in his last outing got
the highest points of any one so
far, with a 8.95.

- The Middies also have quite a
performer in John Gallagher,
who has been consistently scor-
ing in the high eights. Navy also
boasts of a gymnast named Har-
fling,-who has been scoring nines in
fthe long horse vault. Another fine
performer is Bill Mackey, whose
side horse moves have earned him
-close to 9.0 in their meets.

' Coach Warren Neiger explain-
ed his feelings of the upcoming
meet, “We’ll still be handicapped
-in that we’ll still go two events
auntil they are absolutely ready.”
Neiger hinted that Phil Lilly
‘may enter the floor exercise

fCagersDump CMU, 77-47,

by JERRY L. GRUEBEL

After running all over Car-
negie-Mellon, 77-47, Wednes-
day night, the cagers will try
out their speed on the road to-
morrow against Bucknell.

“We were on the other side,”
smiled basketball coach Buzz
Ridl, happy that his cagers were
able to play the role that LSU
found easy to do last week-end.

Cubs Roll Over Tartans

by BILL NAAB

The Panther basketball Cubs really enjoyed Wednesday
night’s contest against Carnegie-Mellon University. In addition
to winning a one-sided 89-57 ballgame, the Cubs could well
afford to occasionally walk with the ball. take off balance shots, and

give up a few easy buckets.

/ But, most of all coach Tim
Grgurich was exceptionally pleas-
ed to give his entire squad a solid
workout. “We got all our guys
in. They (the bench) work as hard
as anyone. We were glad to get
alot of them into the game in the
first half, and some did a real fine
job,” said Grgurich. I

About the only time in the
game when the game was even
close to being up in the air was
in the first seven or eight min-
utes. With 13:43 remaining in
the half, Kent Scott sank a‘ two
pointer and then Bob Cizmarik
tossed in a free throw to break a
5-5 tie into_a three point lead.

Subs Glen Wolfel and Dave
Vaughn played inspired ball in
the dwindling minutes of -the first
half and helped the Cubs to a 40-
31 halftime lead. Vaughn scored
six of the Cub’s last 10 first half
points. Dave exhibited a variety
of movesand a pretty fair hook
shot, whereas Wolfel continued
his accurate passing and tough
defensive work.

At the start of the second half,
however, Grgurich inserted his
entire first string squad. After
the 15 minute mark of the last
half, the game had been broken
into an uninteresting runaway.

At 17:42 of the second half, the
Cubs only helda .11 point edge.

Adams Predicts ‘Tough One’
 As Grapplers Tackle F €9’M

by MARTHA HARTLE V

. After a one-pogint heartbreaking loss to Maryland Tuesday
}night, the grapplers try to get back into the win column to-
morrowwhen they travel to Lancaster, Pa. to tackle the mat-
men of Franklin and Marshall College.

Franklin and Marshall was a 23-9 victim of the varsity last year,

 but coach Dave Adams does not anticipate an easy match tomorrow.
p P‘. — “You can’t tell how our kids will react after the Marylandymatch. They
  might have a setback. I anticipate atough match.”

  

 “Franklin and Marshall will
'}«”j’."be tougher than they were last
 year,” commented assistant coach
 Bob Fehrs, “simply from the

 fact that they have a lot of boys
I:   returning. And they have a real
gi-ij._:",good freshman squad with boys
1*’  who are pushing the varsity.”

 
   
 

D Included among the returning

‘ lettermen are several outstanding
 performers. John Homiak, a sen-
C”-'ior who goes at 137 or 145, was
_ runner-up in the Easterns last
ff",  .-year and he has set the Eastern
 j ‘title as his goal this season. In
  last year's match, Homiak de-
'  bcisioned Larry Cuba 11-4, but
. ’_j"f the two are not expected to face
. .  each other tomorrow since Cuba
—“  will be wrestling at 130.
  * Another boy with Eastern
_ ? jchampionship potential is 177-
 ?, pounder Dave Crikelair. Crikelair
 ‘has lost only two dual meet
1 V matches in the past two years.

»- x

 

 

Other probable starters for
Franklin and Marshall include
John Hilliard at 123, Roger Lee
at 13.0, Jestyn Payne at 137, Doug
Ward, 152, Terry Bowen, 160,
Christ Dexter at 167, Rick Mc-
Bride at 191 and Al Stone at
heavyweight.

Ward was undefeated last year
as a freshman; compiling an 8-0
mark. Bowen is‘ also .a soph. He
was 6-1 as a freshman. Stone is a
senior football player in his
first year with the grapplers.

Despite the number of return-
ees. coach Ron Gray has termed
this rebuilding year for Franklin
and Marshall. “We lost six boys
who were starters for us. This list
includes our co—captains and East-
ern champion Jim Clair. Much of

our success this year will be de-.

termined by how well our sopho-
mores come along.’L’
(Continued on Page 11)

_ But, in the -next five minutes the
frosh stretched the gap to 22
points. Steve Lewis and Kent
Scott threw in most of the points
during the hot streak. Between
them they contributed 12 of the
19 point increase. Cizmarik led
the scoring with 17 points, Lewis
had 13, Scott 11.

But it was no go for Will. He
missed three field goals attempts
and alsothree from the foul line.
Will said, “It was so funny.
Everytime I put the ball up near
the rim, a hand just came and
knocked it away.”

shot five seconds after the open-
ing tap, and the men of Ridl
were never headed. McFarland
kept his shooting eye throughout
the game, leading all scorers with
22 points.

“I didn’t even think about how
many points he had,” admitted
Ridl after the game. “But I knew
he was shooting well. ”

Ridl substituted for the junior
forward with better than 9 min-
utes showing on the clock. But
the hot-shooting hoopsters main-
tained their scoring pace.

“I’m satisfied with their play,”
said Ridl. “It was a tough game
to play. They knew they were
supposed to beat them easily, but
they kept their heads.”

The hoopsters owned a disap-
pointing, 34-28, lead at half-time,
but dominated the entire half. In.
fact, in the last 8:28, CMU man-
aged only 8 points.

The Tartans shot a miserable
25 per cent from the field, how-
ever, ,the second-half romp was
the cager’s doings.

“We stole a lot of passes,” said
Ridl, “and we ran.”

The hoopsters never looked so
quick. Mike Caldwall‘ and Bob
Petrini, in particular, led many
fast-breaks that put the hoop-
sters on the scoreboard. The two
guards maintained their recent
scoring paces — Caldwell poured

in 17 points, while Petrini chip-
ped in with 13.

But one late fast-break, execu-
ted while Caldwell and Petrini
were on the sidelines, caught the
eyes of the small Field House
crowd. Charlie Hunt grabbed a
rebound and pitched the length
of the court to Tom Withers.
Withers caught the ball, turned,
and put a jump shot through the
nets.

The play marked the official
reinstatement of the cager’s tal-
lest man. Hunt had been suspend-
ed from the team for disciplinary
reasons while the hoopsters were
down in Miami during Christmas
week.

“Charlie showed me, that he
really wants to play,” said Ridl,
“and I think he deserves an-
other chance. He's been working
out with the team regularly.”

,Hunt adds more height to the
small cager line-up. The Indiana-
bred center entered the game with
just 3:19 left to play, but Hunt
has to work his way back. He’ll
probably see more actionagainst
a bigger Bucknell five tomorrow
night.

In addition to losing the match
Tuesday night, the varsity may
have lost the services of Bobby
Kuhn again. Kuhn went into the
match Tuesday with an injured
shoulder and he re-injured it in the
march. “I don’t know how bad it
is yet,” explained Adams. “He
was in pain during the. match,
but he did a great job.”

“Bobby wouldn’t even have

hadn't been so close that we

Gary Meckley, the assistant
coach who has been controling
the underclassmen, agreed with
Banner. stating. -“We'll have some
pretty good performers. No real
outstanding stars like last year.
though.

“Our runners will be worked
pretty good,” he continued.
“They’ll run three races each.” '

The four runners who have han-
dled the load so far this season
are Dave Cobb, Dennis Schatz-
man, Dorel Wattley, and Ken
Balkey. This would normally be
the mile relay team, but this
week there is a possibility that
the quartet may enter as a two-
mile unit. Balkey will be in the
mile run, tomorrow, too. He has a
top time of 4:21 in that race. __

One of the frosh is an individ-
ual record holder, already. That‘s
shot putter John Simpson. who
tossed for «the freshman record
two weeks ago against Kent State.
Bob Sebring and Steve Fischer
(pole vaulters) and Don Parato
