\Vith tl1e blessings of the Chan-
cellor, thc Mayor of PllTSl)1ll‘;.;'ll,

tees, the ﬁr;-;t oiiicial investigation
of the University of Pittsburgh
from its athletic to its administra-
tive offices was under way today.

Acting at the request of Chancellor
John G. Bowman, who has been un-
der ﬁre from an aroused student and
alumni body, the trustees of the Uni-
versity at a twice-postponed meeting
Monday night appointed a seven-
member commitee to study what it
termed “the situation at the Univer-
sity in all its phases.”
COMMITTEE LISTED

The committee as selected by the
board includes prominent Pittsburgh
civic and business leaders: A. E.
Braun, president of the Farmers De-
posit National bank; A. W. Roberson,
chairman of the board of Westing-
house Electric & Manufacturing com-
pany; E. T. Weir, chairman of the
board of the National Steel corpora-
tion; Norman MacLeod, Pittsburgh
advertising man; Leon Falk, Jr.,
Community Fund head and member
of the Falk Foundation; Dr. E. R.
Weidlein, director of the Mellon In-
stitute of Industrial Research, and
C. W. Ridinger, president of the Iron
City Electric company.

All are members of the University
Board of Trustees.

PLANS STARTED

Mr. Braun, who is slated for the
chairmanship according to a com-
mittee spokesman, said yesterday
that organization plans were under

‘ way and that the ﬁrst meeting of the

commitee would probably be con-
vened later in the day.

Dr. -Bowman, whose request for
board action prompted the appoint-
ment of an investigating committee,
was enthusiastic about the plan when
interviewed yesterday.

Although emphasizing that the
committee was primarily a reference
committee to be concerned with the
ﬂood of protests that has poured into
his office, Dr. BO\7~.7i1ll-‘.11 admitted that
the commitee will have:—"complete
liberty to look into anything they
want to-—the more they look into 
the better, as far as I’m concerned."
‘FIREVVORKS’ DENIED

Dr. Bowman’s request for board
action plus a strong letter from
Mayor Scully, ex—ofﬁcio member of
the board, condemning the Univer-
sity’s “bad repute” are believed to
have precipitated one of the liveliest
of recent board metings, although any
“ﬁreworks” over recent activity at
the University were ﬂatly denied.

W. A. Mortenson, civilian inspec-
tor for the Pittsburgh Ordinance of-

automatic Garand riﬂe at the first
Pitt Riﬂes forum today, at 12:30
o’clock in 24 Cathedral.

In a letter read to the hoard
by City Solicitor Y\'illia1n A. Stew-
t. at present deputy ina_vor in
Scull_v absence from the city,
the )Ia_\'or told the trustees that
there were niatters “of graver
moment than simply the athletic dif-
ficulties of the University.

Mr. Scully called the board’s at-
tention to the refusal of the Amer-
ican Historical association to hold its
convention in Pittsburgh, a conven-
tion which had been sought with
“great effort and . . . expense.”

“This refusal,” the Mayor’s letter
declared, “was

the City of
Pittsburgh and
all its citizens,”
said the letter.
“It should give
us great con-
cern if We are
allowing our
University to
be in bad repute. If there is just
cause for criticism, we should . -
remove the cause.”

Pointing to alumni protests and
recent student demonstrations as in-
dicative of “a great sense of dissat-

do not feel that we, as trust'e-es,’' ’

should be worshippers of the “Great

The leter further expressed" the
Mayor’s “high personal regard” for
Dr. John B. Sutherland, former Uni-
versity head football coach, as Mr.
Scully dipped into Shakespeare to
say, "if his severence from the Uni-
\-'ersity was wrong—‘His virtues will
plead, like angels, against the deep
damnation of his taking off’.”

  Saunders. to Quit t
. Graduate Position

 Early Next Month

A year-long wave of resigna-
tions continued to spread through
the University this Week as Don
F. Saunders, executive of the Gen-
eral Ahumn

Association, an-

nounced on Moiiday his intention

.of leaving the University next
month.

Faced with terminating a twelve-
year association with the University
that has made him one of the most
popular oflicials on campus, Mr.
Saunders said, “I am sorry to leave
Pitt; I don’t think there is a finer
place in the world——but its future
certainly looks unpromising.”

V Monday’s resignation followed sim-
ilar action by Patrick J. Corr, Uni-
versity swimming coach, whose
week—end statement charged “ma-
ladministration.”

, Mr. Saunders’ resignation has been
explained as the outgrowth of the
long alumni administration feud that
same to a head last winter in the
failure of the University administra-
tion to respond to a vigorous athletic
investigation made by the alumni
committee.

Believing the controversy to in-
volve far more than athletics, Mr.
Saunders declared this week:

“Over a period of years, I have dif-
fered more and more with the admin-

Acting Secretary

Mr. Saunders’ resignation was ac-
cepted by the Alumni Council at its
meeting Monday night. William Al-
lison, editor of The Alumni Review,

erland, and nominated four candi-
dates for two vacancies on the Uni-
versity Board of Trustees.

Two of these nominees will be
elected to the Board of Trustees by
a vote of the General Alumni As-
sociation in April:

Ira R. Hill, Pittsburgh attorney,
and chairman of the alumni com-
mittee which recently investigated
the University’s athletic situation:
Norman MacLeod, advertising execu-
tive, and former president of the
General Alumni Association, who
will be a candidate for re-election to
the Board; Herbert N. Riley, H. J.
Heinz company officer, and president
of the College Alumni; and Floyd
Rose, steel executive and former
member of the varsity football team.

Wilbur D. Hockensmith, other re-
tiring member of the Board of
Trustees, will not be a candidate for

For Art.”s Sake . . .

articles on the University’s art gal-
lery, dealing with its history, ex-
hibits, and permanent works of art.

By John Brosky

Two years ago in September of
1937 and ten years after the founding
of the department of ﬁne arts in the
University, the dream of the art pro-
fessors was realized.

That dream was an art gallery
where the University and the Pitts-
burgh community would be some-
what in touch with the world of vi-
sual expression.

In the two‘ years of its existence,
the gallery, which is on the seventh
ﬂoor with the ﬁne arts library, has
grown steadily with the exhibitions
of art paintings and sculpture work.
The attendance has increased several
fold.

FKICK COLECTION

To start a permanent collection
which will always hang in the gal-
lery, original old art paintings, fres-
cos, and Russian Icons were pre-
sented to the department by inter-
ested people. With such contribu-
tions increasing every year, the Uni-
versity art gallery will be an art
center where all people having an in-
terest in art can carry on valuable
researches.

At ﬁrst, exhibitions comprised
paintings from private collections
that were lent to the art department.

Collection in Fine Arts Gallery
increases in Size, lmportance

This is the first in a series of 0-

year was the collection of 18th cen-
tury portraits belonging to Miss
Helen C. Frick.

Other exhibits last year included
the Index of American Design and a
selection of American Section of
Decorative Arts that were exhibited
in Paris in 1936.

The exhibitions this year have
varied in content and were vital art
works due to the fact that they are
circulations of famous art societies.
Principal displays were the Pitts-
burgh Artists of the 19th century, the
Russian Icons, the National Ceramic
Exhibit, and the Ceramic exhibition
of Chancellor John G. Bowman.

FRESCOS ACQUIRED

Dr. Walter R. Hovey, acting head
of the ﬁne arts department, says, “It
is ﬁne to see the attendance and in-
terest in the gallery increasing. It
justiﬁes bringing to the University
and Pittsburgh works of art.”

In the permanent collection of the
gallery are two Italian original 15th
century frescos removed from pro-
vincial churches in Italy. There are
several icons, the art which domi-
nates the Russian and Byzantium
churches.

The newest acquisition. to the col-
lection is “S. Malo,” an original
painting of Jean Julien Le Mordant,
once a blind French artist. Of great
interest are the bottles, vases, and

Czecl1o—Slovakia has falleii again. Last 1'./eel: the
will of a new European ccnquerer forced the Empless
little republic back irxto its previous state of servitude.
Czecho—Slovakia has been the pawn of European con-

the little nation surrendered its liberty wi1.h.cut blood-

leaders of their own who ruled much of central Europe.
Then Mongolian invaders, known since as Magyars,
';-rushed Slav rule with great cruelty. Again the Czech
state of Bohemia produced a dynasty of rulers capable
of resisting attaclzs from the east and establishing :4 well
organized kingdom in a loosely-knit league of nations
comprising the Holy Roman Empire. In the fourteenth

century, Cze<:h0—Sl0vakia achieved its golden age both_

culturally and politically.

In that century, Charles IV founded the University
Of rogue in Bohemia. It was here that John Huss ax-
pounded his religious ideology which under Luther be-
came known as Protestantism. When Huss was burned
-it the stake for heresy, the whole Czech state rose up to
defy the Emperor and the Pope. The Hussite wars so
xv.-‘cakezied Bohemia that she was forced into  lea?-;=.1e
with Austria and Hungary. Her sister state, Slovakia,
had previously fallen under the iron rule of I-Iungarian
l\-lagyars; to speak the Slovak tongue was forbidden by
law.

After the Napoleonic wars, the Hapsburg kings of
Austria tightened their control on the Sl«:«val~:i.:-in states.
The Empii‘e stayed intact until the l.V0:‘lcl War. By this
time the Czechs and Slovs were so anxious to free them-

Bowser picks up the football reins
with a rich background of Pitt foot-
ball. A graduate of Johnstown high
school, Bowser served overseas dur-
ing the World War and came to Pitt
in 1919. He was a member of the
freshman team, then coached by
Andy Kerr.

head coach played for Coach Pop

;When Williamston joined the Pitt

€orr’s letter

Ivlr. James Hagan.
Director of Athletics,
University of Pittsburgh.
Pittsburgh, Pa.

Dear Jim:

I herewith tender my resignation
as varsity swimming coach at the
University of Pittsburgh effective
at the end of the term of this school
year.

After twenty consecutive years
association with the University,
four as a student and competitor,
and the last sixteen as a coach, it is
with great reluctance that I am
lcrced to take the only step open
to me under the circumstances.

I have no fault to ﬁnd with the
principles underlying the policies
of the Universit_V, but I can not sit
idly by and acquiesce in the way
they are being administered.

As someone has appropriately
stated, “To hear wrongs decently
is a great virtue, but to hear them
when vigorous action would cor-
rect them is slothiulness, one of the
seven deadly-sins.”

You have placed some of us in
the position of grieving parents
whose child has been kidnaped, and
if we notify the authorities you
will harm the child. That is why up
to the present time you have been
successful either intentionally or
unintentionally. in {four efforts to
drive out those of us who have so
long‘ and faithfully served the
I.’nive:'sit;~'.

As long as I was officially asso-
ciatecl with you my voice and hands
were tied. I feel; I can be of more
service to the University on the
outside .that is what prompts me
to take this action at the present
time.

This is to assure you there is no
personal animosity in as far as you
and John Weber are concerned in
my action.

With kindest personal regards,
I am,

urday in. what would be the de-

Sorleymen is that Bob Schooley, hard
checking, high scoring wing and de-
fensem-an, will be back on the ice
after an absence of exactly two
weeks. A charleyhorse. in his right
leg has kept Bob inactive since he;

Wishing to have his team at top

strength tonight, coach John McSor-
ley rested Schooley on Monday, but;
it is doubtful whether Bob’s presence;
would have made much differencei
Snapping out of their their listless
habits developed against Fenn and
Tech, the Pitts exploded their ﬁnest
game of the year in the faces of the
Dukes.

The brilliant play of the Oakland-
ers combined with the elficient work
cl’ officials Patsy Callighan and Mike
B‘ophy, imported from Cleveland to
handle the game, made the match
the most interesting and thrilling of
the collegiate season.

Fifteen one minute penalties and-

Brophy and Callighan. the Dukes be-
ing caught in the act of breaking the
rules nine times and the Panthers six.
Each team was awarded a free shot.

The Panthers scored early in the:
xecond period and hung on to the lead 

.until nearly ﬁve minutes of the ﬁnal;

session had passed. The Dukes tiedi
the count then, and went ahead 2—1E
after almost eleven minutes of the;
frame. Two minutes later Pitt knot- a
ted it up again, but 35 seconds laterﬁ
Bill Vance had put the Dukes aheacl’
for keeps. I
Bob Lowe scored both Pitt goals]
and turned in his ﬁnest performance
this season, but without exception,
the rest of the Panthers matched or
came close to matching Bob’s ex-
cellence. Tatey Brittain, Irv Artz,
Bill Schildecker, Chuck Connick, and"
Dick Friday played like demons
while Walt Lovett, Clyde Shiring,
Pat Cusick, and Len Broido were
away above average.

In the nets for Pitt, Bud Ellis re-I
oeated his last year’s playoff efforts;
by saving on shot after shot in the‘
ﬁnal period. The ﬁnal two Du-
quesne goals would have escaped:
any goalie in the league. I
In the end. it was the near—pro-

- 0’:-lock today, according to Ruth An-

fessional play of Bill Vance, the
‘Dukes’ spectacle wearing center, that
beat the Panthers. When Vance was
off the ice, the Bluffites were just
another good team, but with Philo
in the lineup, Ellis was on the spot.

Lowe’s first score hit the cords at
1:44 of the second period after Lovett
had laid a perfect pass at his feet.
After both Friday and Scully had
missed penalty shots, the Duke ﬁnally
scored at 4:49 of the third session
when Scully flipped a loose puck into
the cage  Ellis went down to at-
tempt a save.

Vance, Foster, and McGill teamed
up on the second Duke tally at 10:48
with Vance scoring, but Pitt sent
five men down the ice and got the
goal back, Lowe batting in Artz’
pass at 12:54}. A few seconds after
the ensuing face-off, Vance took the
disc behind his own blue line, ma-
neuvered past the Panthers in cen-
ter ice, out—skatecl Friday in the de-
fense zone, and Beat Ellis at 13:29.

this team of whirling dervishes, and
their routine has made them the most
famous gym group in the country.

Featuring a series of tableaux that
calls for special bronze paint, these
perfectly trained athletes present
various phases of athletic life. Each
pose is held for three minutes and
calls for a maximum of strength,
poise, endurance, and rhythm.

In addition to these exhibitions,
the program will include individual
and team exhibitions in tumbling, on
the parallel bars, ﬂying rings, Indian
clubs, sabre combat, and long horse
leaping. Several clowning routines
will be included.

All of the group numbers on the
program were created by members of
the Springﬁeld faculty. Professor
Leslie J. Judd, team coach, Douglas
Boyea, and William Wright have
created the varkious routines.

Each aspect of the. aggenda de-
mands individual skill as well as ‘a
maximum degree of team play. Be-
hind each member of the team lies a
background of intensive training and
preparation. ‘

The appearance of this famed gym-
nastic outﬁt is due to the ecorts of
Karl Oermann, current Pitt gym in-
structor and former member of the
Springﬁeld team. Interested in form-
ing a Pitt gym team, Oermann thinks
that the appearance of Springﬁeld
will do a great deal to stir up in-
terest.

Oermann has announced that Uni-
versity students may purchase tick-
ets for the exhibition in the Athletic
otﬁce. Students will be admitted for
25 cents.

Panther to Use
Military riheirie
In 15 arch issue

A pictuxe of Dr. John Bait: Suth-
erland, suitable for framing, iormer
head football coach at the Univer-
sity, will be given with each copy
of the March issue of The Panther,
on sale Friday, according to Thomas
L. Smith, C39, editor.

This issue of the campus humor
magazine will have the Military Ball
as its theme, Smith announced. Sev-
eral articles and cartoons, in addi-
tion to the cover, will feature the an-
nual military formal dance of the
ROTC.

A swing quiz, with brain teasers
originated by Dick Kay, C41, gives
“jitterbugs” a chance to test their
knowledge of swing and to win the
prizes offered. First prize will be a
$3 check on the C. C. Mellor Com-
pany. Second prize is a 82 check on
the same ﬁrm. Additional awards of
cartons of cigarettes and recordings
will be made.

In order to set up a standard for‘
the test, it was given to Benny Good- '

man and Martha Tilton, his vocalist.

istration, particularly as it visualizes
the education process.

“I feel,” said Mr. Saunders, “that
there is little or no correlation be-
tween architecture (alluding to the
Cathedral) and education. In any
really great educational institution
the emphasis must be upon human
values—-—not things material!”

As for his sudden resignation, Mr.
Saunders said, “Inasmuch as I seem
to be out of harmony with the ideas
of the administration on education
and since I think human values
should be taken into consideration, it
is only fair to the administration that
I should resign.”

Mr. Saunders denied any trace of
bitter feeling; said he, “I think Dr.
Bowman has done a great deal of
good work and, as I have told him, I
like him personally, but I disapprove
of his policies.”

Credited with having double the
alumni rolls, Mr. Saunders has been
secretary of the Alumni Association
since 1937. He was formerly direc-
tor of University athletic publicity
from 1927 to 1930. A graduate of the
University, Mr. Saunders is a mem-
ber of Phi Kappa Psi, Sigma Delta
Chi, Omicron Delta Kappa, and the
Pittsburgh Athletic association.

Mr. Saunders will join the staff of
the American Institute of Public
Opinion at Princeton, N. J., on
April 3.

‘Get-Together’ Event

Attempting to foster a wider ac-

On this day, each junior girl will

“What’s wrong with this picture?

If you want the answer to this and

any other problem about good manners, it will pay you to attend the Men’s
Council Manners Forum, held today and every Wednesday in 208 Cathedral
at 2:3'O o’clock,” says Richard Rowse, C41, chairman of the manners project.

rassment. Good manners are an as-
set and a time saver.

Text of Saunders’ Letter

March 20, 1939.
Mr. Earl Crawford, President
General Alumni Association
University of Pittsburgh.
Dear Mr. Crawford:

It is with considerable regret that
I give you my resignation as Sec-
rotary of the General Alumni Asso-
ciation, elfective April 1, 1939. in
order that I may accept a position
on the staff of the American Insti-
tute of Public Opinion at Princeton,
New Jersey.

Through you I want to express to
the members of Alumni Council my
gratitude for the loyalty and co-
operation which they have given
me at all times during the five a.nd
one-half years I have worked un-
der their direction. I shall remem-
ber always and with the highest
regard my friends of the Council as
well as other alumni of the Univer-
sity whom I have been privileged
to know. From my experience, I
can say that the University of

Pittsburgh should be extremely
proud of its alumni body because I
am sure no other school can claim
a ﬁner group of men and women.

Our Alumni Association has made
good progress particularly in recent
years when we have had the largest
membership in the history of the
organization. However, in view of
developments at the University
which have unquestionably im-
paired the conﬁdence and the
morale of our alumni, the future
of the Association does not look
hopeful. I feel that my services to
the Association are no longer of
value because I have become in-
creasingly unsympathetic to some
policies of the University Adminis-
tration which I believe to be detri-
mental to the best interests of the
school and of the alumni.

With personal regards, I am

Yours sincerely,
(Signed) Don F. Saunders,
Secretary.
