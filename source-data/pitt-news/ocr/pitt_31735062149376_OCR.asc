Business Figures
Show Slight Drop

Three-Tenths Per Cent Decrease
Follows Prediction Of Bureau

A drop of three-tenths ofapoint in
the index of business activity in the
Pittsburgh district for the week. end-
ing May 2, climaxed over four weeks
of sharp gains in the general index,
is announced in the Weekly Summary
of the Bureau of Business Research.
This drop brought the index from
86.6 to 86.3.

The index of business activity,
which reached its highest level in the
recovery period in the four weeks
starting with the last week in March,
was expected to show some decrease
in the rapid strides which it had been
making. As a matter of fact, the Bu-
reau predicted such a slow-up would
occur. This prediction was made in
the last issue of the Bureau’s Month-
ly Review.

The Bureau also announces that
signs of curtailment in production
schedules are already in evidence in
some of the major industries of the
district.

The operating rate of the steel in-
dustry, for example, declined slightly
last week after holding for about two
weeks at the highest level since the
summer of 1930. Ordinarily, steel mill
activity reaches the spring peak late
in March or early in April. Therefore,
the decline last week was no more
than seasonal, and the trade is ex-
pecting only moderate additional cur-
tailment in the next few weeks.

Slight increases were also evident
in the industrial electric power in-
dustry, coal production and the vol-
ume of trade. Some diversion from
the general decline was noted in the
index of originating shipments and
department store sales,

The increases in originating ship-
ments was due largely to heavier
river traffic which is credited with
raising the index to 77, four-tenths
higher than it was the preceding week.

Department store sales for the four-
week period ended May 2, exceeded
the total in the same period last year
by nearly 17 per cent.

N YA Checks Available

Students doing NYA work may re-
ceive their April checks at the office
of the treasurer, Room 7, State Hall,
beginning today.

As usual, they are asked to call
promptly. V '

 

 

Campus Shy On Gossip,
But Pitt News Is Shy $1

Giving Pittpourri back to the
students cost The Pitt News $1
and proved that most of the stu-
dents don’t want it. They don’t
want the job of writing the column,
that is, not the $1. Slightly less
than 100 per cent of the undergrad-
uates passed up the opportunity to
become gossip columnists without
half a, murmur.

Several were received, however,
and of these the one submitted by
Edward Parrack, C36, was ad-
judged the best and most usable.
In winning the prize, Parrack again
proved his rversatility. He was
one—half of the champion Univer-
sity dance team, selected at a re-
cent tea dance.

When informed that he had been
awarded the $1, Parrack exclaim-
ed, “Gosh! Only $15.50 more and
I’ll be able to pay my commence-
ment fee.” ' _

entry judged second best appear

Final Meeting Today Will Present
Program For Peace Workers

 

'Kirby Page, internationally known
traveler and writer, will be featured
at the ﬁnal meeting of Inquiry Forum
today in Room 107, Alumni Hall, at
12:30 o’clock.

In speaking about “A Program for
Peace Workers,” Mr. Page will give
speciﬁc material for peace advocates
to act rather than to talk about. He
will probably present some of the dy-
namic spirit found in his book “Liv-
ing Creatively.”

fore a.t YM-YWCA meetings as
an interpreter of present world con-
ditions, is here today in connection
with the national emergency peace
campaign, sponsored locally by a
council of all peace organizations
wth chapters in the Pittsburgh dis-
trict.

[He will appear at tonight’s Com-
munity Forum with George Lansbury,
head of the British Labor Party, and
Rabbi Ferdinand Isserman, who are
touring a number of cities to launch
the emergency campaign to keep
America out of war.

A phase of the national campaign-
that should be of special interest to
students is a special school -to -be held
this summer to train students in fur-
thering the campaign. Students, fol-
lowing the training, will do “ﬁeld
work” for the duration of the sum-
mer vacation. Some will Volunteer

Quality Point Average For Graduation

To Be Gradually Raised To 1.0 By 1939

According to the deans of all un-

dergraduate schools, the requirements
for graduation from their respective
schools will be gradually raised begin-
ning in 1937.

At present, a quality point average
of .75 is necessary, with the addition-
al stipulation that for each credit or
“F” grade a deduction of two quality
points is made.

There is also a rule in all four of the
undergraduate schools that not more
than 30 credits, 25 per cent of the
credits required for graduation, in
which a grade of “D” has been receiv-
ed can be counted toward gaduation.
This is commonly known as “the D
rule.”

New requirements as adopted by the
undergraduate schools are as follows:
for students ‘graduating within the
calendar year 1937, a quality point
average of .83 will be required; .92
will be the-minimum set for those who
graduate in the calendar year 1938;
those graduating within the calendar
year 1939 must attain a quality point

Biologist Pens Survey
On ‘Radiation Effects’

Dr. George M. McKinley, instructor
in biology at the University and a
pioneer in the development of biolog-
ical research with short electric (ra-
dio) waves, is the author of one chap-
ter in the two-volume study, “Biolog-
ical Effects of Radiation.” The book
has recently been edited by Dr. B.
J. Duggar, University of Wisconsin,
under the sponsorship of the National
Research Council committee on radia-
tion.

Dr. McKinley’s chapter, “Short
Electric Wave Radiation in Biology,”
is one of 43 chapters in the 1300 page
study. The study was made because
of increasing interest in the effect of
light on living human matter and the
use of light in treating human ills.

A graduate of Pitt, Dr. McKinley
was a reporter on several western
Pennsylvania newspapers before join-
ing the Pitt faculty in 1929. He was
a member of the 29th U. S. Engineers
in France from 1917 to 1919. He holds
membership in Sigma Xi, honorary
scientiﬁc fraternity; Phi Sigma fra-
ternity; and is faculty adviser of Col-
lembolae, honorary natural science
fraternity.

Ebert Contracts
‘Dailey Double’
.For Senior Bull

Witli the Preakness coming up next
Saturday, the Senior Ball ,“bookies”
are urging students to lay their $2.50
down on the line for a “Dai1ey Dou-
ble” that is a sure ﬁre “hit.”

An inside tip reveals that Dailey
has already won the race for the pole
position on the night of May 22‘, and
along with the Schenley ball room,
will .run away with the race in the
very near futurity. In fact, there will
be no other-“starters” that night.

Dailey, whose ﬁrst name is Frank,
with his 14-piece Columbia Broadcast-
ing orchestra is now playing at the
exclusive Meadowbrook Club in New
Jersey, and is a regular feature’ in late
evergins b1'oadcasts.- . fseaasqast to
coast.

Those fancy “Mortar Board” signs,
“with due apologies to the copywrite
owners,” says Chairman Charles
Ebert, Jr., “will soon appear \n cam-
pus all done up in black and white.”
He has, he points out, reversed colors,
making the graduation cap back-
ground in white and the advertise-
ment facts in black type. “So you
see it’s all down there in black a11d
white and all you have to do to get
on a winner is to see your nearest
bookie (any member of the Ball com-
mittee),’’ Ebert concludes.

Dress To Be Summer Formal

Hal Kemp and his International
favorites will replace Dailey at the
Meadowbrook Club, when the CBS
dance outﬁt opens its regular spring
road-trip later in the month, Preced-
ing Dailey at the Club was Ozzie Nel-
son, Harriet Hilliard, and orchestra.

At last year‘s Senior Ball, Russ
Lyons and his broadcasting band were
featured at the Hotel Schenley.
Ebert’s policy this year i11 securing a
ﬁrst-rate national band has followed
precedent established by former stu-
dent chairmen of this ﬁnal major
dance of the school year.

The dress for the affair will be
strictly formal. An announcement
of when tickets Will go on sale will
be made at a later date.

A committee meeting will be held

in Room 821, Cathedral, at 3 o’clock
today.

Pre-Med Group l'Vill Hold
Annual Dance Friday Night

Pre-Meds will hold their only dance
of the year this Friday, May 15. The
affair, being held at Chartiers Heights
Country Club, will have Sid Dickler’s
orchestra playing the latest dance
tunes. Tickets priced at $1.50 a cou-
ple, may be obtained from all mem-
bers of Chi Rho Nu, honorary pre-
medical fraternity. Russell Bartruff,
C38, is chairman of the dance. Danc-
ing is from 9 to 1 o’clock.

 

 

Old To Meet New
SFA At Banquet
Tomorrow Night

Elections Of New Executive Board
Scheduled To Follow Dinner,
Farewell Talk By Harvey

Student Faculty Assembly, old and
new, will meet together for the ﬁrst
and last time tomorrow evening, as
they .dine on a “roast sirloin of beef”
dinner at the Cathedral Mansions at
6 o’clock.

At least that’s the information
gleaned at the office of the dean of
men. But the bit about the beef is
about the only thing that’s certain re-
garding the coming meeting. Elec-
tions to the new executive committee,
it is true, will be held, but results are
still far, far up in the air.

William Harvey, C36, retiring chair-
man, will have more than a few things
to say to his successors. He will
probably recommend the retaining of
most of the sub-committees which
were set up after the meeting last No-
vember, with, he says, certain revi-
sions and shiftings of responsibility.

40 comprise Governing Body

If the farewell address of Leonard
Marks. C35, president of the assem-
bly last year, is any criterion, the
new repres_entatives will have to wa.it
for quite a while before swinging into
the most important business of the
evening, that of chosing the execu-
tive committee, the body which has
a great deal of authority, and, in ef-
fect, shapes practically all of SFA's
policies,

The governing body consists of 40
members, ten from the faculty, and
15 from each of the upper two classes,
elected each year during the latter
part of April. The executive commit-
tee chosen from this group contains
six students and three faculty mem-
bers, who, for the last two years, have
been Dr. Vincent VV. Lanfear, dean of
men, Miss Thyrsa W. Amos, dean of
women, and Theodore W. Biddle, as-
sistant dean of men.

At the ﬁrst meeting of the execu-
tive committee, which will probably
be ca.lled for Wednesday, the group
will elect its chairman, who will also
act as presiding officer to SFA.

Friday Last Day,
Dixon Announces

 

 

Senior Announcements Committee
To Finish Sale This Week

 

-Friday is the last day on which or-
ders may be placed for senior an-
nouncements, Alfred Dixon, BA36,
chairman, has stated.

A stand has been placed in Alumni
Hall, where a member of the commit-
tee will be on service each school
day. Photographs may still be sub-
mitted for the book. Dixon says, and
the prize for the best snaps still holds.

Unique in its design, the announce-
ments book covered in blue leather
sells for 35 cents and with the white
cardboard back sells for 25 cents. A.
newly cut design featuring the Ca-
thedral from a novel angle adds dis-
tinction to the book, Dixon says.

The different divisions of the book
will be preceded by photographs from
those submitted for the contest. They
should contain shots of still life
around campus, buildings, lawns,
trees and such, but without people,
Included will be the names of all those
receiving degrees in June.

Orders may be placed this week
only with members of the committee,
at the Alumni Hall stand, and at the
office of the dean of men, Room 801,
Cathedral.

 

Lecture On Glass

 

Dr. Alexander Silverman, head of
the department of chemistry at the
University of Pittsburgh, will address
the Lehigh Va.lley Section of the
American Chemical Society at Cedar
Crest College, Allentown, Pa., on Fri-
day, May 15. The title of the talk will
be “Glass: One of Man’s Blessings.”

Institute Poll Asks, ‘Are Communism,
Fascism, Socialism Proper Subjects?’

 

Do you have tendencies in the di-
rection of Communism, Fascism, or
Socialism? If not, are you anyway,
anxious to uphold academic freedom
—the right _of free inquiry and open
discussion in the classroom? In
either case, you will have ample rea-
son for marking “X” on the proper
line of the ballot printed in The Pitt
News today.

The question, propo-unded by the
American Institute of Public Opinion,
is: “Should schools teach facts about
all forms of government, including
Communism, Fascism, and Social-
ism?

Answers to the question may be
dropped in ballot boxes in Alumni
Hall, State Hall, Thaw Hall, the lob-
by of the Cathedral, and the seventh
ﬂoor of the Cathedral outside The
News Office in Room 709.

Today’s poll is the last of a number
that have been conducted through
The Pitt News, in conjunction with

the American Institute of Public
Opinion. The outcome of the campus
poll will be published in The News
soon.

Answers of University students will
be sent to New York and tabulated
with those from the public-at-larage.
Results of the national survey will be

printed in the “America Speaks”
feature of the Pittsburgh Press for
May 17.

sary to leadership with a view toward increasing the
eﬂiciency of the executive bodies of all the organizations.

Activities are an important part of the University life
and have been recognized as such by members Of the
faculty, a fact which was demonstrated by the interest
shown in the open forum Thursday. The question be-
fore the group was “Resolved: That the administration
of the University of Pittsburgh, recognizing the value of
extra-curricular activities, should provide time for them
in the daily schedule.” Many of the department heads
and more prominent faculty members attended and par-
ticipated in the discussion to the point where they com-
pletely monopolized it.

Faculty Favors Activities Period

The concensus of opinion among those who spoke was
that an afternoon, or parts of two afternoons should be
set aside as an activities period. It is interesting to
note that those professors who are most friendly with
their students and have had most contact with them out-
side the classroom were most in favor of this activities
period. Anyone who has ever attempted to schedule a
meeting knows the difficulties to be met under the pres-
ent ‘system. With a special time set aside in which all
activities should meet, each group would have a better
opportunity of setting up a deﬁnite program which could
be followed without interruption throughout the year.

Then, too, this period would tend to do away with the
“big activities man” who has a hand in every organiza-
tion, and extend the beneﬁts of extra-curricular work to
more people. With all the groups meeting at the same
time, a student would be forced to concentrate on one or
two activities, giving the more timid and backward stu-
dents a chance to shine in one project. In an urban uni-
versity such as ours, students are entirely too likely to
come to classes and go home immediately afterward.
Vvith activities given a special place and included in the
school curriculum, more commuting students would have
an opportunity and incentive to get a real taste of col-
lege life.

The Institute followed the growing tendency toward
specialization and government by experts by inviting to
its sessions only those to whom oﬂices or chairmanshi-ps
have been assigned for next year. Thus a division into
small uniﬁed groups for discussion of particular prob-
lems was made possible. It sets an example which
should be followed by all other organizations and stu-
dent activities-—that of assuring success in future proj-
ects by giving those responsible for that success an op-
portunity to discuss methods of increasing their unde-r-
standing of the work and by training them to avoid the
mistakes most common to their work. WSGA seems to
take the stitch in time that saves nine.—C. A.

Because they so cordially invite relaxation, the Cathe-
dral library chairs are likely to introduce a new wrinkle
in white linen suits this spring.

New Library Books

Three books about literature are included in the new
books at the University library this week.

“The Plays and Poems of 'W- S. Gilbert” has been pub-
lished by Random House, with a sketch of Gilbert’s life
by Deems Taylor, American music critic. In this col-
lection are the complete texts of the 14 famous Gilbert
and Sullivan operas “Mikado,” “Trial by Jury,”
“The Gondoliers,” and all the rest. Also, there are the
three plays, written by Gilbert after his break with Sul-
livan, and a series of comic poems called the Bab Bal-
lads, ﬁrst published in 1869. These are illustrated with
pen—and-ink sketches by Gilbert, himself.

“Sir Philip Sidney as a Literary Craftsman” is a new
study by Kenneth Orne Myrick. In it the author under-
takes to demonstrate that this Renaissance writer was a
great craftsman, in spite of the accepted contrary belief.
Works discussed are the “Defense of Poesie,” “Arcadia,”
and “New Arcadia.” This book is Vol. XIV of the Har-
vard Studies in English.

A new biography, “George Eliot,” by Blanche Colton
Williams, has come in. In preparation for this book, the
author consulted old diaries, documents, the British Mu-
seum, and even descendents of the famous woman
writer.

H. L. Mencken’s exhaustive study, “The American Lan-
guage,” has been published in its fourth edition.
Mencken deals with the growth of the American idiom
and traces its sources in other languages. Included in
the book is a dictionary of Americanisms.

The “Cambridge Medieval Histony,” which has been
published volume by volume since 1911, is completed
with its eighth volume, “The Close of the Middle Ages,”
now in the Library. In this ﬁnal volume all phases of
the period are covered, from the Councils of Constance
and Basic to Political Theory in the Later Middle Ages
and the Renaissance in Europe.

The News Readers Have Their Say

Editor, The Pitt News:

Of course you remember the Peace
Session, the student-faculty meeting
on April 22. It was a splendid pro-
gram, we'll have to admit, and Dr.
Hovde, Dr. Clausen, Mr. Goldberg, and
Mr. Raushenbush of the senate in-
vestigation committee ﬁred us full of
oratorical tidbits on the coming war.
They made it clear to us that some-
thing must be done, if anything can
be done. before we are dragged into
the meshes of war.

I Yes, that was a splendid assembly.
But wasn't it called for a better pur-
pose than to hold an oratorical con-
test? VVeren’t the gentlemen who
prognosticated death on the ﬁeld of
the proverbial glory just a little inter-
ested in bringing about some action
on the side of the paciﬁsts before the
war begins? W'ere not the students,
threatened to destruction, more than
slightly impressed by the meaning of
the assembly?

How many of us today have thought
constructively about the suggestion of
the speakers on the 22nd of April?
More than three weeks have elapsed,
and now we have become interested
in tap day, spring festival, and gradu-
ation. But the peace assembly has
been forgotten,

Remember the assembly! Remember
the plea for peace! Remember the
threat of death! And then laugh at the
hypocrisy of such a meeting. A nicer
set of theories, a nicer grouping of
metaphors have not been heard on
campus for some time. And the stu-
dents were duly impressed. We don’t
object to the meeting. It was a no-
ble beginning. But perhaps it was
the beginning of the end.

Maybe you believe in orations. Per-
sonally I don’t. I like to see action
with speechmaking, especially speech-
making that proposes action. The
peace advocates offered us war and
urged us to work for peace. Mr.
Raushenbush claimed that we must
sit tight and each, in our individual
way, work for peace. He admitted
that something must be done and
then, strangely enough, forgot to pro-
pose that something. The other
speakers followed suit,

Let’s have another peace session
and, instead of abstract lectures, let's
hear a few concrete suggestions, The
students are interested in peace: the
assembly proved that. But the stu-
dents can’t work on platitudinous ab-
stractions. Maybe May Day and
Spring Festival is more fun. At least
it’s concrete.

MILTON G. LEHMAN, JR.

Editor, The Pitt News:

I want to commend The News for
printing last Friday, what is in my es-
timation, the meatiest edition of Pitt-
pourri this year. In case you have
forgotten, it contained absolutely noth-
ing; just a blank space in its place.
In fact it has never merited anything
but a blank space.

After all, Pittpourri should con-
cern itself with as many students at
the University as possible. Now,
when you conﬁne a column to a cer-
tain clique on campus, a few of the
fraternity boys and a handpicked
group of seniors and juniors, it is time
something were done about it.

What does this honorable column
contain anyway? Here are some shin-
ing examples. “Johnny VVl1ataguy was
seen wearing blue shoes recently . . .
yoo hoo.” Certainly is interesting
isn’t it? Or, “Joe College actually
carries Esmeralda Coed’s books after
class.” How naive.

If we can't have anything better
than that from the tripewriter of the
Pittpourri columnist, then we had bet-
ter get another writer for that col-
umn..

Superintendent Tells Seminar About Recent

‘Charge Of Light Brigade’ During Flood

By Sam Williams
Where were the light companies
when the lights went out during the
ﬂood? According to Mr. Thomas E.

Purcell, general superintendent of
power stations, they were up to their
necks in water, and it wasn't hot
water either but water at 35 degrees
with cakes of ice level with the work-
ers’ chins.

At the AE-ME seminar meeting last
week, Mr. Purcell told his graphic
story of Duquesne Light Company’s
efforts to keep power in the lines. He
told of the foresight of the company
when its plants were rebuilt in 1919
so that it could operate at a ﬂood
stage of 40 feet.

As the company makes a business
of preparing for the unexpected, it
was well aware that a ﬂood would

occur when the rate of rise of the riv- ,

er shifted from six inches an hour to
eight inches at about 8 o'clock Mon-
day evening.

The steam heating plant on Du-
quesne Way shut down Tuesday eve-
ning when working conditions be-
came impossible. The men were work-
ing up to their chins at this time.

At 7 o’clock Wednesday morning
there was 10 inches of water in the
boiler room of the Brunot Island
Plant. Because a potential transform-
er which carries 12,000 volts was
placed too low when the Reed Sta-
tion was constructed, this plant was
forced to cease operation Wednesday
morning. The Colfax plant alone re-
mained in operation.

All power ceased when the Colfax
plant failed at 4 o’clock Wednesday
afternoon. Here the workmen had
braved the icy waters all day in their
valiant effort to furnish power. One
of their greatest difficulties was keep-
ing the water condensers clear of
debris. These condensers had to be
taken apart and cleaned frequently.
When this was done the men crowded
around to get the full beneﬁt of the
warm water.

By this time, 4 o’clock, the Pennsyl-
vania-Ohio Company, the Johnstown
station, and the West Penn Spring-
dale plants were down.

Arrangements were made as soon
as possible to obtain power from
plants outside the affected area. The
ﬁrst line was brought into Pittsburgh
through Warren by the Niagara Hud-
son Power Company at 4:20 o’clock
Wednesday afternoon. Other lines
were brought in from Ohio. In some
instances row boats had to be used
to make the connections as the sta-
tions were inundated.

The light company’s troubles did
not cease when the power was hooked
in, however, for it was then necessary
to disconnect lines in the ﬂooded
areas until they could be dried out
so that no short circuits would result.
Then it was necessary to allocate

power because all demands could not
be ﬁlled. Hospitals, dairies, cold stor-
age plants, pumping stations, the tele-
phone company, telegraph system,
street lights, residential districts,
stores, and restaurants all received
lights in that order as soon as possi-
ble.

The company's employees, all re-
called immediately, were put on 24-
hour shifts and worked from ten days
to two weeks before relieved. It was
estimated that 12 million gallons of
water was pumped from the Brunot
Island Plant. All of the equipment
in the plants had to be dissembled,
wiped clean and dried. Large drying
ovens had to be constructed to per-
form this operation.

The ﬁrst turbine was put into oper-
ation at Colfax Sunday morning. Then

to further complicate matters, a truck
bearing important replacements over-
turned on the Lincoln Highway. The
equipment was so badly damaged that
it had to be replaced.

Operation returned to normal when
ﬁre hoses were used to clean the one-
fourth inch to one foot mud at the
Reed Station, and the plant was put
into operation Monday morning.

Linksmen Battle

Undefeated W& J
Team Tomorrow

Coach Devlin’s Wash-Jeﬁ' Sextet
Risks Record Against Crack
Panther Golf Outﬁt

Panther golfers will be driving
down the fairways with the undefeat-
ed Presidents of W & J tomorrow aft-
ernoon at Washington, Pennsylvania,
when the two teams exchange cracks
at par on the Nemacolin course.

Coach Jimmy 5evlin’s proteges
have been sailing along in smooth
fashion this season, having disposed
of four opponents in an easy manner.
In their last match, the Prexies drop-
per Carnegie Tech’s linksmen by an
8-1 margin.

W &. J Team Strong

Gould and Wayman will probably
take care of the top posts in the start-
ing lineup, with Gould teeing off
against Symonds, Pitt topnotcher, and
Wayman bumping into Frank Sou-
chak’s long drives.

The remaining four jobs will be
ﬁlled by Groshell, Miller, Elder, and
Butters, in that order. In the Skibo
match, these four men came through
with top-heavy scores over their Tar-
tan rivals.

Jack Vvasco, Sam Musico, Bob
Mease, and Bob Baughman, respec-
tively, will probably be named "by
Coach Snyder of Pitt to start.

Earlier in the season, the Panthers
whitewa.shed the Tartans, so that com-
parative scores would seem to indi-
cate that tomorrow’s match will be
close. The fact that W & J will be
playing over a familiar course adds a
little to the Wash-Jeff cause,

Cornell Linlzsmen

Topple Panthers

The Pitt golf team dropped its
fourth straight Eastern Intercollegi-
ate Conference match on Friday to
Cornell by a- 5-4 decision. Cornell
took three of the singles and two of
the tandem affairs to nose out the
Panther representatives.

Frank Souchak continued his ﬁne
play, scoring his sixth consecutive
victory of the season. Shooting a par
72, Souchak defeated Cornell’s second
best, Cameron, 4 and 2. -H.is medal of
72 was best for the Pittsburghers.

Pat Symonds, No. 1 star, dropped a
3 and 1 decision to Wilcox, Cornell
ace, and the No. 1 Red player teamed
with Cameron beat Symonds and Sou-
chak in the best ball svent, 2 and 1.

Panther power came to the fore in
the No. 3 and 4 position as Jack Was-
co and Sam Musico went to town.
Wasco trounced Smith, Cornell, 4 and
3, and Musico scored the most deci-
sive Pitt victory with a 6 and 5 tri-
umph over Rounday. In the best ball.
Wasco a.nd Musico scored with a 4
and 3 victory.

Rodgers ls Low Scorer

Rodgers, No. 5 starter for the Big
Red, took low scoring honors for the
day with a brilliant round of 70, two
under par ﬁgures. It was just Bob
Mease’s luck to have to face these
sub-par cracks, and he lost by a. 6
and 5 score.

Baughman, Pitt, lost to Morton, 6
and 4, a.nd the Morton-Rodgers duo
swamped Mease and Baughman, 7 and
6 in the foursome play.

On Saturday afternoon, the golfers
faced Penn State in the ﬁnal sectional
match of the conference. The winner,
probably Princeton, and runner-up of
this western section will meet two
teams from the eastern division in a
round-robin tourney for the league ti-
tle.

Considering that most of the league
matches the Panthers lost were close
ones they made a respectable showing
in their ﬁrst season of league play.

Panther Net Stars
To Meet Tartans

‘Short-Clads’ Rated As Favorites
In Wednesday’s Court Match

With a new nickname, “short-
clads,” justly titled because the Mad-
dens, Balds, and other Panther ten-
nis stars play in shorts, the netters
will match strokes with Carnegie
Tech on Wednesday afternoon at the
Stadium.

The short-clads with four straight.
match victories show promise of be-
coming one of the greatest court or-
ganizations in University history.
Only a complete reversal of form on
the part of the Pitt raqueters would
give the Tartans much of a chance on
Vvednesday, if the pace the Pitt
sextet is setting at the present time
can be used as a guide.

Not much is written about the play-
ing of Captain Joe Madden, but rec-
ords show that the elder Madden,
probably the greatest punster around
these parts, has lost very few matches,
in his two seasons as a varsity per-
former and has yet to lose an encount-
er this season.

As a sophomore, Joe, playing the
No. 2 position, won 13 out of 14 sin-
gles’ matches, dropping a closely-con-
tested encounter to Mann of Navy.
In the following season he dropped
three matches, but came out on top in
eight jousts. Adding the four victor-
ies this season, his record shows 25

triumphs and four setbacks in his
three _vear’s of play, a pretty ﬁne
showing for a lad who mixes Pitt

Players, Cap and Gown, Glee Club,
ODK, and other activities with his
court work.

Tune, ‘Let Yourself Go,’ Brings
Walter Good ‘Good’ Results

Taano, Good-u Roommates, Waiters, Track Stars"-
Now Become Penn Relay Title Holders

.By Edwin H. Beachler
To the tune of “Relax, let yourself go,” Walter Good sailed to

his ﬁrst Penn Relay title two weeks ago.

When the Gary, Indiana,

senior completed that winning jump in the hop, step, and jump, he
duplicated a. feat of his roommate, Gene Taano, Ashtabula, Ohio,

junior. And therein lies a tale.

Now the unusual part of the sto1y¢
Was not so much that the two track] a throw of 193 feet. Taano was still

aces have been rooming together for
the past three years, sharing meals,
conﬁdences, and even the same girl.
It was, however, unusual that both
boys were crowned champions on
their second attempt at a Penn Relay
title, that both boys won out on their
sixth and ﬁnaltrial, and that both
boys were managed by “the ace man-
ager in the spiked shoe game,” Mr.
Carl F. Distelhorst, No. 1 rooter of
this pair.

Today, both boys display gold wrist
watches as evidence of their victories.
It is the ﬁrst time since the days of
Everett Utterback that the awards
for individual accomplishments have
accompanied Pitt athletes on their
trip home from the games.

Distelhorst Manages

Taa.no was included in the regular
squad delegation for the Relays, but
Good was left at home until “Diz,” as
the two proteges know Mr. Distel-
horst, decided that perhaps Walter
did have a chance to win his special-
ty. So, 24 hours after the squad had
entrained for Philadelphia, the Dis-
telhorst-Good duo set out for the
Quaker City by auto.

Driving all Thursday night, they ar-
rived at the Franklin Field track a
bit sleepy-eyed, cramped, and dusty
from the al-night grind. Walter took
a few jogs around the track, returned
to his hotel room, and then “turned
in” for a few hours’ nap in prepera-
tion for the hop, step, and jump event.

Meanwhile, Taano had paced a
large ﬁeld of qualiﬁers in the prelim-
inary round of the javelin event with

a step ahead of Good later that after-
noon when he tossed the spear past
the 197-foot mark to win the title.

Taano’s roommate was in second
place when the Finnish-stylist in the
javelin hurried over to watch the last
two trials of the hop, step, and jump.
Walt held second place, and with only
one jump to go, still had to better 44
feet to win.

Hits Mark On Final Try

As Good limbered up at the runway,
“Diz” slipped up behind him and
whispered “Come on VValt, just think
of that part of the song “Come, get
together’ where you ‘just let yourself
go», relax, etc.’ ” That was precisely
what Good did as he leaped to the
second Pitt title of the day, duplicat-
ing his roommate’s feat.

‘That night, it was the “Champs’
car” that contained Messrs. Distel-
horst, Good. and Taano as it headed
East for Pittsburgh. _

Coincidental is the fact that both
boys in their ﬁrst, and only other at-
tempt in the Relays, placed second in
their respective events, Goo-d won
his runner-up title in 1934, after
“thumbing” his way all the way to
the championships. It is that kind of
stuff that makes both boys great ath-
letes.

The roommates live in the Belle-
ﬁeld Dwellings. Both athletes are
good students, and are working their
way through the University. They
are well-known to members of the
faculty, serving as waiters daily in
the Faculty dining room, 17th ﬂoor,
Cathedral.

Tracksters Meet
W. Va. Saturday

Gedwilas, Star Distance Runner,
Heads Mountaineer Threat

Coach Olson’s Pitt Panther track-
men slip over the state border into
Snake territory. .deep in the West
Virginia foot-hills, Saturday, to tangle
with the Mountaineers in the fourth
dual start of the season.

Barney Gedwilas will still be there
with all his “shootin’ irons,” as will
several others, who vividly remember
a terriﬁc 93-32 lacing handed out on
the Stadium track last year,

In that meet, Gedwilas established
a new tri-state standard in the two-
mile run with a fast 9:37.4 perform-
ance. This year, Mr. Franklyn Theri-
ault for the Panthers has been doing
things of note in the same event, and
may give the smooth-running Moun-
taineer a surprise or two.

Just whether the Olson squad has
completely recovered from the Irish
setback two weeks ago will be de-
termined before the ﬁnish of Satur-
da.y’s hostilities.

Red Tost should have his toughest
test of the season when he lines up
against Gedwilas in the mile run. The
Plumville, Pa., red head has been hav-
ing a great year thus far this season,
and a victory over Gedwilas would
provide a ﬁtting climax.

Gr-oat, Connelly Favored

Gene Taano“ is expected to walk
away with the javelin event, with
Bennett in a similar position in the
high jump. Charley Groat and Harold
Connelly rate favorites in the middle-
distance events, and if Thomas has
fully recovered from his Penn Relay
injury, the sprints should have a Pitt
man out in front.

Coach Potts’ yearling squad accom-
panies the varsity to Morgantown for
a dual engagement with the little
Mountaineer runners. The frosh
squad scored a tie in its ﬁrst start of
the outdoor campaign, deadlocking
with Altoona High track squad.

Intramural Mushball Tournament
Begins As Four Leagues Play
Opening Games Last Week

Four leagues having played their
opening games, the ﬁrst week of play
in the Intramural mushball tourna-
ment has been completed.

First group to get started was In-
dependent League D with two late
afternoon games Wednesday. In one
of these games, the Student Alliance
intellectuals showed that they are as
liberal with their basehits as they are
with their thoughts by -pacifying Kap-
pa Alpha Phi, 6-4. This was a sting-
ing upset to the bookies, for Kappa
Alpha Phi is » defending Intramural
champion.

Hanson Hits Homer

The game was won in the seventh
inning when, with two on and two
out, Roger Hanson slammed out a
home run. Bill Stark also contributed
a four-base blow- to the Alliance total.

League D's other game was a hit-
ters battle. The Civil Engineers
scored 21 runs, four more than the In-
dustrial Engineer aggregate of 17.

Greek League B's winners were Pi
Lambda Phi and Sigma Alpha Mu.
The Pi Lambs humbled Phi Gamma.
Delta, 15-4, and the Sammies turned
back Sigma Alpha Epsilon, 8-3.

Thursday, only one of the two
scheduled games in League A was
played. Phi Kappa came through

with a 7-4 triumph over Delta Tau
Delta. The Kappa Sig-Phi Delt game
was postponed.

Caesarians Undefeated

Medical League results show only
one perfect record, that of the Caesar-
ians. They beat the Ahoys, 9-6, and
the Little Potatoes, 15-4. Little Pota-
toes and Ahoys bo-th have a .500 show-
ing. Besides losing to the Caesarians,
the Little Potatoes nosed out the
Ruhesers, 2-1. The Ahoys also gained
their victory at the expense of the
Ruhesers, 7-5.

Interfraternity games will be played
tomorrow at the practice ﬁeld. In
League A at 6 o’clock, Phi Delta Theta
meets Phi Kappa and Delta Tau Delta
encounters Pi Kappa Alpha. League
0 games, scheduled for 5 o’cl-ock, have
Theta Chi bumping into Sigma Chi
and Lambda Chi Alpha playing Phi
Epsilon Pi.

ment store and were ﬁnished by the
members of the cast. Sleeping’ 13e3_“1'
ty, the heroine, will wear a white
satin gown made on P1‘111Ce-‘$3 111135
with a full skirt. Prince Charming,
who breaks the_ curse of the W1tC_=h.
will wear a typical costume, of white
breeches, a ﬂowing 03138, and 3 large
beret with a white ostrich plume. The
two comedy characters of the ballet,
the white lady cat and Puss-in-Boots,
will dance their courtship in the ears,
tails, and whiskers of regular cats.
Flower Fay and the witch will also be
suitably costumed. Ballet SOWDS 01
pastel chiffon will be worn by the
chorus.

Early Italian and modern French
songs, and early English rounds W111

Truth Of 5-Year
Prophesy Tested
By Mortar Board

Five years ago, members of the ac-
tive chapter of Mortar Board on cam-
pus decided to put some extra inter-
est into one of their meetings by mak-
ing prophecies about one another’s fu-
ture. The crystal gazing took a seri-
ous turn and at the suggestion of the
president, Hermine Ruoif, the prophe-
cies were carefully written out and
the group promised to meet ﬁve years
later and test their predictions.

Reunion pledges are seldom kept,
but the honorary fraternity met as
promised, and the results of their pre-
dictions form an interesting story in
this month’s issue of the national
Mortar ‘Board quarterly. They had
predicted marriage for Marie Brack-
man, Olive Cole, Margaret Hall, Anne
Rosenswieg, and Virginia Wickersham,
and the reunion conﬁrmed the predic-
tion. A medical career, without mar-
riage, was forecast for Elizabeth
Coopernail, but the young lady is now
managing both a profession and a hus-
band. Hermine Ruoff and Josephine
Bliley kept true to prediction by en-
tering personnel work, and the teach-
ing positions promised for Dorothy
Griffiths, Frances ‘Stewart, Alice Wal-
ton, Sarah Drum, Naoma Ericson, and
Mary Munsch proved correct.

The most challenging prophecy was
that given to Florence Luman, editor
of the 1931 Owl. “She will be living
in New York in a penthouse,” said an
imaginative seer. “She will have an
interesting and responsible position;
and she will be surrounded by famous
and fascinating people.” As training
director of Sterns in New York City,
the former editor has gained the repu-
tation, the career, and the acquaint-
ances forecast for her. Only the pent-
house remains to make the prophecy
perfect.

Scots Honor Sutherland,

tobacco. The men were so honored
for their services during the past
year on the committee.

Four Amendments Added To WSGA Constitution
In Early Sessions Of Leaders Institute

In a panel discussion considering the possible provision of a deﬁnite
time in a student's schedule for participation in extra-curricular activities,
members of Leaders Institute heard many viewpoints expressed by faculty

members who attended.

Sitting on the panel, headed by Miss Thyrsa W. Amos, dean of women,

were Dr. Charles S. Tippetts, dean of:

the School of Business Administra-
tion; Dr. Stanton C. Crawford, dean
of the College; Elmer A. ‘Holbrook,
dean of the School of Engineering
and Mines; Endicott A. Batchelder,
assistant registrar; and Theodore
Siedle, assistant professor of educa-
tion. Student members of the panel
were Ruth Anderson, C36, Ruth Sha-
piro, C37, iHelen Rose Gibson, C36.

In launching the discussion, Dr.
Crawford expressed the opinion that
too many students come to school for
activities and go to a few classes if
there is any spare time ‘left over. In
considering the values of extra-cur-
ricular activities, Mr. Batchelder
brought out the point that such ac-
tivities may give practice in the very
matters taught in the classroom. He
claimed that this has been his ex-
perience as an undergraduate at the
University. In corroboration, Dean
Tippetts said that activities give one
the necessary knack of getting along
with people.

Activities For More People

A student asked whether, since in-
dividual students cannot arrange ac-
tivities to suit their own schedules, it
was fair to ask the University to give
time for activities. Another student
suggested that a possible solution to
the present harried state of activities
participators might be to raise the
scholastic average for participation.

But to this suggestion Dean Hol-
brook voiced an emphatic negative
opinion. He pleaded for more activi-
ties for more people, with a widened
scope, and with less specialization; he
favored any move that would increase
activities participation. Mr. Holbrook
therefore would not favor any limita-
tion by a scholastic requirement.

In answer to a suggestion for the
scheduling of all activities at deﬁnite
periods each day, Mr. Batchelder ex-
plained in detail the problem that now
confronts the schedule committee in
scheduling classes for the limited
number of classrooms. The proposed
activities periods would hamper the
assignment of science laboratories,

why Chesteiﬁelds Satzlvfy.

It’s the right quantity of this Turh-
ish tohzzcco blended and cross-
hlmded with the hest home- grown
tohaccos raised in this country that
give Chesterﬁelds their mildness
and hatter taste — another reason

whose time is required by a state law.
Dr. Samuel Williams, the ﬁrst per-
son to speak when discussion was
thrown open to the audience, brought
enthusiastic applause for his sugges-
tion of devoting one afternoon a week
to activities. “We must appropriate
deﬁnite time for activities,” he said.
Dr. W. H. Shelton, head of the de-
partment of modern languages, took
the side of the parents in suggesting a
clinic to determine if a student was

“over1oaded." Both the time spent
and the student's health would be
considered.

Less Faculty Supervision

Dr. B. J. Hovde, associate professor
of history, recommended less regi-
mentation of students as far as activ-
ities are concerned, and less super-
vision of activities by faculty mem-
bers. He declared that everyone has
to get “fanatic” on a subject sooner or
later, and that the student should be

‘given free rein to make his own mis-

takes and corrections. His conclusion
was that if the student had gone
“nuts” on the wrong subject, he would
ﬁnd it out soon enough. Other faculty
members present concurred in the
opinions expressed,

In an open meeting of WSGA held
in the early part of the annual Lead-
ers Institute, four amendments were
made to the WSGA constitution. The
ﬁrst amendment required selection of
representatives of the freshman, soph-
omore, and junior classes who would
serve on the commission for the fol-
lowing year. Previously the constitu-
tion required representatives from
each class, although under the fresh-
man unit system, no member of that
class is included in the WSGA com-
mission.

Other articles acted upon were des-
ignating the vice president as chair-
man of the housing committee; pro-
viding for nomination of WSGA of-
ﬁcers; and the last brought the list of
standing committees up to date, At
the conclusion of the meeting, officers
and commission members of WSGA
for the coming year were installed.

Professors Participate
In Radio ‘Town Meeting"

participated in the Town Meeting pro-
gram over KDKA last Tuesday eve-
ning.

The subject under discussion was-
“Do oaths and salutes make good pa--
triots?” Among the barrage of tele-
phone questions that came in during
the program was, “lf oaths are so ef-
fective in preventing communism,
why not have criminals take an oath
and prevent crime?” The speakers did
not answer the question.
