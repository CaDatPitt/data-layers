Symphonetta   HereThursday

By Musicians

The Pittsburgh Symphony
Symphonetta, an ensemble of
twenty-six musicians from
the Pittsburgh Symphony Or-
chestra will return for a con-

cert in the Student Union’

Ballroom this Thursday, Oct. 23,
at 8:30 p.m. ‘

This " all—university musical
event is under the auspices of the
Student Government Association.

The Symphonetta was organized
three years ago in answer to the
demands of communities in the
Pittsburgh area where stage facili-
ties or budget limitations do not
permit the presentation of a full
symphony orchestra.

The Symphonetta is presenting
a program of classical music with
popular appeal. The selections
range from “Symphony No. 1 in C
Major” by Beethoven to “Selec-
tion from ’Oklahoma’ ” by Richard
Rogers. Included in the program
are the following: _ '

I
Wolf—Ferrari . . . . . .Overt-ure,
“The /Secret of Suzanne"

Suzanne tried to hide from her
jealous husband a guilty secret,
her fondness for cigarettes.'The
sprightly overture to the opera is
a reminder that there were days
when smoking was almost exclu-
sively a vice of masculinity.

quently arranged the prelude for
organ obligato and orchestra, and

later used it as an instrumental

Claims Governor
‘Just Innocent’

Attacking Governor Lead-
er’s qualiﬁcations for United
States Senator, Representa-
tive Hugh Scott addressed
University students last Wed-
nesday at noon in the Student
Union Ballroom.

“The Governor might spend 100
days in Senate before something
comes up that he knows about,”
he charged". “The Governer is not
so much ignorant of foreign policy
as. he is innocent,” the Republican
candidate for Senate claimed.

He stated that when Leader was
asked his opinion on FEPC, the
Governorireplied, “I have not yet
thought the matter through.”

Scott also revealed that
Leader has refused eight invi-
tations from various universities
and club groups to appear in an
open debate with him, although
Scott has been willing to attend.

When asked if the was" in favor
of the admission of Red China to
the United Nations, Scott answer-
ed .“I am against recognition of
RedeChina by the,United Nations.”
' “Red China is still at war and
has never joined ‘in the Korean
armistice.” A second reason he
gave was that “Red China still

holds many of our missionaries
and airmen , prisoners.”

Representative Scott stated, "A11 I

The recent election is proof—positiVe that 3 I1€W 133515
for party ‘organization must be established. I

The Allied Collegiates had a moderate Victory» to be
sure, but certain aspects of the election point to thefact that
the parties in their present form are not long‘ for this
campus. - ‘ _’

I For instance, quite a few fraternity men ran against
the Allied Collegiate slatewhich is supported primarily by
fraternity men. Three of these men won. There is no longer

.- the complete control of fraternity candidates that was true
in former times. ' -

,__,. Although the Allied Collegiates claim to represent

‘I “100 per cent of the student body,” this is evidently a myth,
since not one independent upperclassman was slated for this
election or last spring’s election.

It is true that the United Independents had time against
them in the formation of their slate. It is far easier for a
party with .major support from well-deﬁned organizations
to gather and campaign for candidates than for a party
which‘ must per force ‘rely upon generating enthusiasm
among individuals.

It is questionable how closely either of the parties
checked the qualiﬁcations of their candidates.

It is the suggestion of this paper that student leaders
think of the possibility of organizing parties on a more
equitable basis or abolish them.

( faction (no longer even unite_d for itself) cannot indeﬁnitely
retain power. They will have to slate on qualiﬁcations of in-
dividuals rather than proportional representation of various
groups. I ‘ ,— a 

, The UI Party members, although‘ they slated a few
Greeks, still consider themselves revolutionistsagainst the
entrenched fraternity groups. ' H

_ There are pertinent issues‘ which might be supported,
and platforms need not be pieces of clever writing, one
party mimicing the other. ‘ '

Catch A Falling   Phrase

By Joseph Ungar
Detroit has opened its gates and the new cars
are pouring out again. They are bright and shiny
and sleek, and their presence — even their antici-
pated presence — does much to make the weary

‘citizen look up and sharpen his 

senses. It is like a ﬁfth season
of‘_the year, a season of tin rat-
tling between fall and winter.

Accompanying the new cars
are new features. One boasts of 5
a “heat resistant rear window.” .
Another has an accentuated tail-
(in with a chrome—tipped point
that looks sharp enough to poke
a hole‘ throught the‘ casing of a
good-sized blast furnace. A
Increased. Ferocious Horsepower

And just about all the cars are ﬂung along by
an increased and somewhat ferocious reserve -of
horsepower, which the manufacturers insist is _a

‘safety factor, despite the testament of morticians

who always become slightly overburdened on cer-

_ tain summer week-ends.

So the cars are new and their features are strik-
ing. But the most intriguing thing about the whole
business is not the cars themselves; rather, it is
the way they are promoted by- the advertisers on
Madison Avenue. '

These men, adept at all sorts of subtle deception,
seem to revel at the opportunity to push something
that is considered really big. They become excep-

. tionally creative; sometimes at great length. They

coin phrases that have the sound of grandeur and
the substance of cotton candy.

‘It is never just a new car the advertisers speak

of. It is,‘as taken from spreads in the latest maga- '

zines, “the start of a new styling cycle,” “the spark
that ignited a chain reaction of new ideas,” or
“a new realm of Amotoring majesty.”

Numerous. "Battered Superlatives ‘

Then, to reinforce these claims, numerous but
battered superlatives are added, always 'in tripli-
cate. “Big, wonderful, beautiful” “dazzling,
enchanting, inspiring” .. . . “soft, quiet,.sure—footed”
(which sounds rather anemic compared to theother

 

two, so it has to be backed up later on with “lean,
clean, low”).

Why doesn’t anyone ever stop to ask how a car
C.a'l'1_'be inspiring? 9

After ﬁnishingwith the abstractions, the adver-
tisers turn to speciﬁcs, which are often nothing but
extended vagaries. Occasionally these vagaries are
isolated and inconsequential, arousing little thought
or confusion. '

A car is dazzling because it has an “Equipois
chassis,” or wonderful because of a “control center
instrument panel.” This doesn’t mean much but
who cares. '

However, trouble arises when the speciﬁcs begin
to reserfi-ble each‘ other, when there are attempts
to acclaim similar features of different cars. The
situation becomes puzzling. Which gives. the better
view, a “vista-panoramic windshield” or “a sweep-
ing expanse of glass?”

Do you get more leg-room with “inner _spacious-

vness” or with a “vista lounge interior?” Which

kicks up the. most dust, a “spectacular new engin ,"
a “Tempest 429 engine” or a “Wildcat engin-‘?"
The descriptive words carry scant means for
comparison. ' ' '
Forceful. but Annoying Clincllers
- Probably the most annoying parts of the ads,
however, are the forceful statements that are
supposed to serve as clinchers. Aimed at the cus-
tomers ego, they are intended to convihce him
that he will better his character, clarify his ambi-
tions, elevate his soul, or something like that,
simply by buying the car. A

Thus, one hears an_intrinsic, self—attainable at-

~ tribute in the statement, “This car provides a total-

ly new sense of mastery over time and distance.”
One feels an intuitive truth in the pitch, “Your
eyes, your heart, your good sense, tell you it’s the
car.”

And with ‘solemn glee, one sees the ladder. sur-
passing the Smiths in the phrase about this car
having been tailored for the “world’s most discrim-
inating motorists.”

Few can deny that the automobile advertisers
are hard at work. Through clever inferences, im-
pressive adjectives, and dramatic shallowness, they
are trying to build. a golden calf.

On Religious _ Issues

Edit\o‘r~, the Pitt News:

Thanks for your excellent edi-
torial in the Oct. 13 issue of the
Pitt“ News.

By all means, continue to in-
clude in a single announcement
the Tuesday noon services of wor-
ship in Heinz Chapel and in the
Hillel Lounge, along with the an-
dnouncement of Father Berkmyer’s
class in G—24 Cl. _

The “major revamping of the

‘ religious program,” for which
your editorial rightly points out
the need, is well under way.

We have the‘ Student Council of
Religious Organizations, w i t h
three representatives from each of
our 15 campus religious fellow-
ships. -

'It has made considerable head-
-way in recognizing the “religious
pluralism” of our University. Its
monthly programs, its fourttwo-
day conferences on religion, and
its entire religious emphasis seek
to honor and elicit the best that
each faith _is able to contribute to
more meaningful and effective liv-
ing.

It has no use for any watered
down common denominator of
agreement. It is bringing to our
campus very able spokesmen of
Protestant, Roman Catholic, Jew-
ish and Eastern Orthodox reli-
gions; and a number of brilliant
students of the role of religion
in education. It is making pro-
visions for other than Jewish and
Christian religions.

, Surpassingly beautiful, Heinz

Past SCRO President
Backs Chaplain. Luccock

Editor, the Pitt News: .

As past president of the Student
Council of Religious Organiza-
tions, I feel somewhat acquainted
with the problem of Chapel Serv-
ices. This problem is certainly not
new, for it along with other mat-
ters of religious programming
have been and are being actively
considered by both the University
Bo.'u'd of Religion and. the Stu-
dent Council of Religious Organi-
zations. '

Chaplain Iiuccock has partici-
pated in these comprehensive dis-
cussions and has‘ constantly co-
operated in seeking a solution to
these problems.

He, more than any other per-.
son, realizes the weaknesses in our
religious program and for that
very reason early supported the
creation of our unique Board of
Religion. _A

Now I can certainly sympathize
with your concern over calling
the Protestant services “Campus
Chapel Services.” But as to your

.immediate solution‘ of listing the
"Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish

services “in one box,” I would
simply remind you that the Stu-
dent Council of Religious Organi-

zations made this very suggestion

in writing to last year’s Editor of
the Pitt News. , . .
I am sure the Chaplain as well

as other religious‘ leaders of all in

The long range solution to this
problem is unfortunately not so
simple. Everyone will agree that
the present Chapel can be used
more effectively, and even Mrs.
Heinz last year expressed the hope
that a more varied _program take
place within the Chapel.

This wish is being implemented
today by presenting programs for
the student body in the beautiful
surroundings of Gothicart. In ad-
dition, suggestions are being
sought from “all the faiths as to
the possible use of a rotary altar,
etc.

I also share the hope that an _

answer to this problem can be
found in the very near future, but
the fact remains that not only
Chaplain Luccock, but also the
Board of Religion and the Stu-
dent Council of Religious Organi-
zations realize the need and are
and have been evaluating this and
other religious programs.

Program To Help Mentally 111
Open For Volunteer Students

‘A volunteer program for
students desiring to work
with mentally ill patients is
being formulated by the Com-

munity Service Committee of
the _YM—YWCA.

Mrs. Mary Summers, supervisor
of Volunteer Activities at Mayview
Hospital, will introduce the pro-
gram this Thursday at 4 p.m. in
119 SU.

Anyone interested in helping the
mentally ill is welcome to come.
Leading psychiatrists such as Dr.
Jack Ewalt, Massachusetts Com-
missioner of Mental health, and
Dr. Milton Greenblatt, research

director at Massachusetts Mental
Health Center, fully endorse this
program.

Dr. Ewalt has said, “I would
heartily recommend this pro-
gram to other states. Student
volunteers could do a lot to
make up for the nationwide
shortage in professional person-
nel which today is the most ur-
gent problem facing the mental-
health administrator.”

Steven Spencer, staff writer for
the Saturday Evening Post, writes,
“Certainly all of these students in
their close and sympathetic con-
tact with the mentally ill, have
acquired a depth of understand-
ing they could have gained in no
other way.”

ToI1cicAssures Victory °
With Pass Interception

Ivan Toncic’s pass interception in.the Panthers’ end zone
on the last play of the game ‘enabled the Blue and Gold. to
gain their fourth victory in ﬁve starts as they downed the
Mountaineers of West Virginia, 15-8, last Saturday.

‘ AVStadium crowd of 42,269 saw West Virginia march 93
. yards in the waning moments of play. With’ 1:15 remaining in
the last quarter, Mike Ditka punt-0'
ed out of bounds on the Mountain-
eers’ one—yard line. The Panthers
were leading 15-8. . - ‘
West Virginia, however, refused
to quit. Two consecutive passes
from Quarterback Danny Williams
to Dave Rider and Terry Fair-
banks gave the visitors‘ a first down
on the Blue and Gold 46-yard line.
A pass interference call on the
next play against Curt Plowman
gave the Mountaineers a ﬁrst
down on the 26. Chuck Simp-
son’s pass was deﬂected by John
Guzik, but Fairbanks was able
to make a diving catch of the
ball on the six.

,With four seconds remaining
‘Simpson tried to hit‘Fairbanks in
‘the end zone but Toncic came
through with his-game-saving in-
terception.

The Panther touchdowns were
registered by John Flara on a 71-
yard pass play from Toncic in the
second quarter and‘ an eight-yard
sideline pass from Toncic to Dick
‘Haley near the end of the third
period. West Virginia’s only score
came in the opening quarter on a-
three-yard keeper play by Wil-
liams. ‘ P ,

As usual, the Panthers got ‘off
to a very slow start. A fumble
by Flara on his own three set
up the Mountaineexs’ ﬁrst tally.
On second down Williams’ out-

back over right tackle was good
for the touchdown. Williams
then passed to ‘Rider for the
two-point conversion. .

Near the end of the ﬁrst hall’
the Panthers had a t.hird—down-
and-ten situation on their own 29.
Toncic then hit Flara on the W'est
Virginia 17 and the ﬂeet halfback
went, the remaining distance un-
touched. Bill Kaliden passed to
tie the game on the conversion at-
tempt. " V

The deciding touchdown saw the
Jungle Cats march 64 yards in ten
plays midway through the third
period. The big gainers were Ton-
cic’s passes to Art Gob and Haley."
With 3:58 left, Toncic hit Haley
near the sideline for the _score.
"Marty Baracca added the ﬁfteenth
point on a successful plackkick.

Toncic ﬁnishedxthe day with
ten pass completions out of 13
tries, good for" 209 yards. _ ,

The consensus among the vie-
torious Panthers after the battle
was that this was their worst team
effort of the season. “Pitt was the
team we wanted to beat most and
the boys gave it all they had, but
it just wasn’t enough,”_ commented
the 1oser’s coach, Art Lewis, in the
dressing room after the titanic
struggle. «

  Mountaineers, 35-0

By JACK’ SMITH

When the dust ﬁnally cleared at Clarksburg, W. Va., last
Thursday evening, the Panther freshmen had gained a stun-
ning 35-0 victory over West Virginia’s frosh.

The Panthers, who gained approximately 285 yards on
the ground and. 75 yards in the air, controlled the ball

Statue of Liberty
At this point Quarterback Har-
vy Yoos called the old statue of
Liberty play. The play worked to
perfection as Ed Ferdinand circled
end for Pitt's first tally.

Following exchange of

punts John Kopp recovered a -
west Virginia fumble on the
Mountaineers’ 46-yard line.
Frank Scrip, Tim McElroy, and
Ed Clark then carried to the 10.
from where Clark smashed off
tackle for the ﬁnal yardage.

A pass from Harvey Yoss to
Joe Latvis added two extra points.
All points were scored in the sec-
ond quarter.

3 TD’s in 2nd Half
Cecconi’s boys came up with one
touchdown in the third quarter
and two in the last. _ .
Touchdowns came on a one-yard
run by Mike Frasca, ‘an 18-yard
run by Len Mossor, and a 15-yard
touchdown run by Clark, his sec-
ond of the game. Ed Ferdinand
added two points on a pass, while
Len Mossor had a placement.
Other outstanding players on
‘the frosh squad were: Joe Lat-
vis, John Yaccino, Larry Vig-
nali, John Kopp, Tim McElroy,
Mark Lenz, Regis Welsh, and
Regis Coustillac
Coustillac won the Shriners’
award, which was a piece of lug-
gage, for being selected Pitt’s most
outstanding player.
After the game the referees.

the Pitt team was. All Cecconi
