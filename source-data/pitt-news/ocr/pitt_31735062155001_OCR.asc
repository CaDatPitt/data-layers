Lifting of Women’s   Curfews
Proposed by Student Leaders

Proposals to eliminate curfews for sen-
ior women and to allow senior women over
21 to live off campus were brought before
Women’s Housing Board Thursday after-
noon. Action on the proposals will follow
a panel discussion of the issues and a vote
by the women dormitory students;

Seven women student leaders proposed the
changes to the Board, which is composed of elected
representatives of undergraduate women living on
campus. The Board makes .all decisions about wom-
en’s housing regulations, subject to the approval of
Associate Dean of Women Savina S. Skewis.

The seven students argued that the suggested
changes would aid University women in developing
the’ responsibility prerequisite to assuming a posi-
tion in an unsheltered adult society.

Present Regulations

The present regulations demand that under-
graduate women not living with relatives reside in
on-campus University housing until they reach the
age of 22. Senior women must also normally be in

the dormitories by midnight on week nights, 1:30
Friday and Saturday nights, and 10:30 Sunday eve-
nings under the present system.

‘S The removal of women’s curfews, as proposed,
would be applicable only with parental permission
in cases where the senior is under 21 years of age.
It was suggested that the proposal be extended
to allow all undergraduate women over 21 to live
off campus, rather than just seniors.

The speciﬁc "stipulations of the proposal will not

be formulated, however, until after the panel dis-_

cussion, which will be open to all women students.
The participants and date for the discussion will
be set at this Thursday's Housing Board meeting.

Three of the seven women who proposed the
changes, Jane Gould, Jean Kornfeld, and Nancy
Delaney, are Junior Worthies, and a fourth, Joan
Gelfond, is the woman Senior Worthy. Of the other
three, Karen Woolf is president of Mortar Board,
the senior women’s honorary; Sue Evans is active
in Heinz Chapel Choir; and Ann Kozart is chair-
man of the Student Union Board P. M. Series and
serves on the Liberal Arts Cabinet.

rowded Rally  

Urges Sitters Under 
‘No — No Tree’ To Vote 3
For Barry Goldwater

By JACKIE KATZ and CHRIS MARTIN

A crowd of more than 6,000 cheered, applauded, and
a few booed vice-presidential candidate Hubert Horatio
Humphrey Thursday as he talked for an event-packed
hour and urged students who wanted “to sit under the
no-no tree to vote for my opponent.”

On a specially built platform on the Cathedral lawn,
the Democratic second place nominee, waved, gestured and ‘
joked under an almost ﬂawless sky.

The senator, who arrived 20 minutes late, had several inter-
ruptions. During the speech he left the platform to receive a
call from President Johnson; Goldwater hecklers caused some
fun-or; and Senator Humphrey interrupted himself to report the
World Series score, to respond to student Sylvia Shapiro who
sang “Hello Hubert” and to comment on the Goldwater 

The Presidential phone call may or may not have been to discuss
the Khrushchev resignationéenator Humphrey didn’t say. But he
was more speciﬁc about the World Series score—ﬁve to zero. Senator
Humphrey commented that he “hoped the odds are that good on
election day for Johnson and Humphrey.”

Senator Humphrey, who is known for his rapport with uni-
versity students, had this to say to his young listeners: “You
know that anyone who doesn't understand change is dead and
doesn’t know it. I want you to study ancient history, to do well
in it, to learn it, but for Heaven’s sake, don't vote it!”

100 — Man Guard Protects A
Senator; 2 Dozen Spectators 

Rumble Over GOP Placards

ByALJANEZIC

Over 100 city, county and University policemen successfully pro-
tected Senator Hubert Humphrey on Thursday afternoon, but a Uni-
versity coed and approximately 25 spectators weren't so lucky.

They were reportedly attacked by three ruffians and pummeled
about the head and body when the young men apparently became
incensed by police who grabbed their anti-Johnson placard.

According to the coed, the ruckus began when a group of Hum-
phrey supporters allowed the trio to position themselves in a prime
viewing spot, supposedly to tote a pro-Johnson sign. However, the
men unveiled a sign which read, “Jenkins, LBJ’s Profumo.”

Warned by Detective

J ohnson-Humphrey supporters then attempted to block the sign.
A plain-clothes detective supposedly saw the jockeying and warned
the threesome to remove the sign or the security police would. They

The surprise resignation of Soviet Pre-
meir Khrushchev will not adversely affect re-
lations between the United States and the So-
viet Union—say several University professors
and instructors in the Departments of History
and Political Science.

Contacted late Thursday night, ‘Dr. Carl
Beck, Dr. Daniel Cheever, Dr. James Clarke,
Dr. Richard Cottam, Richard Friedman and Irwin
Schulman, agreed that Khrushchev’s resignation was
not due primarily to his ill health or advancing age
but rather to a type of purge in the Communist Par-
ty system. .

Both Dr. Beck and Dr. Cheever believed that
Khrushchev had resigned or been asked to step down
because of a defeat or loss of prestige in the Presidium
of Communist cabinet. According to Friedman and Dr.
Cheever, Khrushchev was removed due to his insis-
tence on a meeting of Communist leaders later this
year. .

All agreed that the new two-man government in
Russia is merely an interim arrangement and that as
a two-man system has never worked before one man

Leonid Brezhnev and Alexei Kosytin, were groomed
by Krushchev, they should continue his liberal policy
and create, according to Dr. Cheever, a smoother and
less violent government in Russia than ever before.

The group believed that there will probably be no
great change in Russia’s policy toward Red China in

the long run, although in Dr. Clarke’s opinion Khrush-
chev’s removal was to try to salvage some unity in
the Communist Party. Though Mao-Tse-Tung, presi-
dent of Red China, may be pleased with the removal
of the premier, said Dr. Beck, Khrushchev’s successor’s

will not go far in repairing the China-Russia break. 

Dr. Clarke predicted a new effort to accommodate ' 

the Red Chinese. The successors, he said, may enforce
a stiffer, though not necessarily bad, policy toward the
United States. The other men, however, foresaw little
or no policy changes.

Dr. Cheever and Dr. Beck stated that the interna- 
tional unrest could cause the public to vote for Presi- A

dent Johnson in November, due to his experience in - 77‘:

The nuclear issue of this
year’s presidential campaign
is “phony,” Jack McGregor,

~ state senator from the 44th

senatorial district, told the

University Young Republi-
cans last Wednesday.

Sen. McGregor, who served

 as a delegate to this year's
National Republican Conven-

tion, said that “What Senator
Goldwater has been talking about
is already the (nuclear) policy

of the United States.” Goldwa-

ter, he noted, would use nuclear

"weapons “only if they were ﬁrst

used against us.”
According to newspaper col-

gumnist Henry J. Taylor, whom

he quoted, “. . . the NATO com-

‘mander has the power to utilize

nuclear weapons in retaliation
against an attack.”

Smears Unfortunate
‘ The state senator commented

that it’s unfortunate that .so

many smears have been against
Senator Goldwater in this re-
spect.

ord, McGregor quoted the then
Senator Johnson, in 1960, as
saying “I am not now, and nev-
er have been an advocate of civil
rights.” He, however, suggest-
ed that Johnson must have
“seen the error of his ways”
because he now supports civil
rights.

McGregor also quoted John-
son’s remark on extremism—“I
have no use for the odd b.alls of
the far left or the far right, be it
the Americans for Democratic
Action or the Ku Klux Klan.”

Extremist Concern

' McGregor suggested that if
Johnson and his supporters are
“really concerned about extrem-
ism” they should “get their own
house'in order.” This, he com-
mented, includes repudiating a
six-time Socialist candidate for
President, Norman Thomas.

McGregor praised the Republi-
can Party in Pennsylvania, which,
he said, shows that “A state.can
assume its share of responsibil-
ities and at a level closer to the
people.”

Jazz — Or is it Rock

By BARRY SHAW

The Student Union Board presented the ﬁrst of its

jazz series on Thursday night, with the Al Morell Trio.
I Morell entertained for more than two hours in the lower
lounge of the Student Union, which was set up cabaret
style, with checkered tablecloths and candles. ‘He added
- to the intimacy with short comments between works, but
the crowd that flooded the Union detracted from the

effect.

In fact, this was precisely Mor-
el1’s problem. In commenting on
the fact that Dave Brubeck and
Stan Getz had “made it” because
they went “commercial,” Morell

‘ rather bitterly admitted that he

would never “make it” because

" he 'didn’t play. their kind of

sound. His sound was, instead,
the rock and roll sound, loud,

‘-with a steady beat, but made

sophisticated because it was

— termed “jazz.”

_ Not a Jazzman
Morell was not a jazzman in

~ the sense of Brubeck, nor did

he have the Ray Charles type of
“soul” that, he needed for the
music he was playing.

ity of them fmmd him complete-
ly entertaining, although it
seemed that in actuality, his
‘greatest successes oocured when
he played the more “commer-
cial” sounds that he had com-
mented on.

“The Girl)’, a Stan Getz tune,
and a number inl three-fourth
time entitled “Tag,” all showed,
in the beginning, the cohesive-
ness of sound that characterizes
good jazz today. But even ‘these
selections soon wound up sound-
ing like the rest of the selections
Morell played -that night. Al Mor-
ell had a foot-tapping appeal to
which no one could resist, but as
jazz, it seems that he failed.

refused, saying, “Yeah? Let them
cover over.”

Four policemen did, grabbed
the sign and walked off. The
irate three then turned on the
crowd. While others nearby
scattered after" being flailed at
and thumped about the body,
said the coed, she was elbowed
in the eye. She added, “They
went wild. Literally. They beat
up at least 25 people and kick-
ed and pounded people on the
head and back. It was unbe-
lievable.”

At another spot on the Cathe-
dral lawn, however, a pro-Gold-
water supporter said he also had
trouble -— but with the police.
He claims he was carrying a
sign which said, “Walt Jenkins.
Bobby B., Billie Sol, ‘Let Us Con-
tinue’ LBJ.”

Accuses Maloney

While he was holding the sign,
he said, Assistant Supt. of Police
Lawrence J. Maloney walked up,
snatched the sign and strode
away. When one of the group
protested, he said, Maloney push-
ed him and told an aide to take
him away.

Maloney when told of the
charge, denied anyone was
pushed by any policeman. He
said that his men got a. tip that
a group of Democratic support-
ers saw the sign and were
planning to “work them over.”
To prevent a ﬁght, he said, the
police took the signs and roll-
ed them up. returning them
after the rally.

He continued, “Anything that

might start a riot we eliminate.
Similar incidents occurred dur-
ing Miller's appearance at the
Syria Mosque.” But all in all, he
said, “the students were very
orderly and enthusiastic.”
Warned of Trouble

University Police Police Capt.
Charles Ray reported that every-
thing went smoothly. But appro-
xiinately 150 city, county and
University policemen were sta-
tioned throughout the campus
area, he said, after having been
warned that “something could
happen.”

Said Capt. Ray, “There was a
man in every doorway in the
Cathedral. We had a sergeant
on the 18th ﬂoor with a two-
way radio and two men were
on the lawn with binoculars to
scan the Cathedral. We had
men on every roof level of the
Cathedral and secured Clapp
Hall.”

In addition, the city and coun-
ty had numerous men on roof-tops
with binoculars, many crouched
and unseen from the street. An
ambulance and doctor were sta-
tioned adjacent to the lawn.

Though police claimed they

didn’t,see any melees, Bill Val-'

entine, chairman of the Pitt
Young Republicans, did have a
statement. “The Pitt Young Re-
publicans as an organization had
no part in the heckling and the
placard-carrying at the rally.”

No one was arrested. And only
one young man, not from the Uni-
versity was held for questioning
after shouting insults at Senator
Humphrey.

(Continued from Page 1 )

On a more serious note, Sena-
tor Humphrey assailed the Ari-
zona senator on issues of educa-
tion, the Peace Corps, civil rights,
food for peace, and foreign poli-
cy.

On education: Senator Hum-
phrey quoted Senator Goldw.ater
as saying: “It is not the respon-
sibility of the government to pro-
vide education, but it is the re-
sponsibility of the parent.” Sen-
ator Humphrey added: “Then he
added insult to injury by saying
‘some people would be better off
without it (education).”’

On the Peace Corps: “This
bill is one of the greatest suc-
cesses of the government even
though I saw Goldwater brand
the bill as a ‘haven for beat-
niks.’ He didn’t See any hope
for the bill; he didn’t believe
in you; he voted against it-
but.how wrong he was.”

On civil rights: “The Republi-
can Party gave us Lincoln and
Lincoln gave us the Emancipa-
tion Proclamation. The 1964 GOP
standard bearer voted against the
Civil Rights Act; he repudiated
Lincoln. The purpose of the act
is to fulﬁll the national doctrine
of human equality. His vote
makes him popular with some
members of the Ku Klux Klan,
but it doesn't make him right.
Deep down in his heart he knows
he is Wrong.”

On food for peace: “Today this
program is helping to feed 100
million children in schools in

other lands. It was supported by
Eisenhower, started under his ad-
ministration, expanded under
Kennedy, and expanded under
Johnson. Everyone votes for it——
even church groups and business
organizations — but not Senator
Goldw.ater. He wants no food for
peace, no food for people.”

On foreign policy: Recalling
Goldwater's no-vote on the test
ban treaty, Senator Humphrey
said, “Thank God that better
minds prevailed; that Congress
put humanity above prejudice,

country above party. A shoot-
ing war might cause death to
millions of people but accord-
ing to the Arizonian’s book
The Conscience of a Conserv.a-
tive, we cannot make the avoid-
ance of a ‘shooting war our
chief objective. All I can say
is ‘happy landing boys.”’

“Goldwater admires the ruth-
less brinkmanship that the Ger-
mans have shown which caused
so much grief in this country.

examples of Imperial and Nazi

Germany is a person who has no
understanding of past history or

serted.

Humphrey remarked that we
should “continue our great peace-
ful plans to tame the atom and’
to explore the stars. The senator
from Arizona is not interested in
getting to the moon; he wants to
plant a bomb in the Krem1in’s
men’s room.”

Editorial: chance to Grow R

 

Seven senior women approached AWS Housing Board Thursday with one of the
most crucial proposals of the year —— to abolish hours for senior women and give

 ' them the option of living off campus.

 . The group was an elite one, women who had already shown their responsibility
' to the campus and were asking that the rest of the seniors be allowed to show theirs-

 .The group included three Junior Worthi'es, the 1964 Senior Worthy, a Phi Beta Kappa

member, the president of women’s science honorary Quax, the president of Mortar
Board, the editor of the 1964 Owl, and the chairman of the Student Union Board PM

Series.

They used the responsible channel, submitting their proposal ﬁrst to Housing
Board which serves as the main policy-making body for the Women’s dorms and as an
advisory committee to associate dean of women and head of housing Savina Skewis.
And even though the Board was generally favorable to the idea, it was the group of
seniors who urged them to take the idea back to the women i‘n the dorms and feel out
reaction before they voted for a panel discussion and referendum.

These women consider this so crucial because it’s going to be a test, a test both
of the University’s attitude toward the students and of the students’ attitude toward
themselves. Miss Skewis seemed amenable to the idea at Thursday’s meeting, but she
also holds the power to the idea at Thursday Board decision. And it would be tragic

to veto this question particularly

ter themselves.

before the women could debate and decide the mat-

For this proposal crystallizes the whole ideal the University promotes in writing
on the “development of the student as a whole person.” Twenty-one-year-old women
can vote and can marry without their parents’ consent. They should also be able to
decide what kind of living experience they want from their last year in college. Legal
responsibilities are automatically theirs; this responsibility should fall to them just

as naturally.

It must be remembered that these privileges would be optional, with the women’s

- LETTERSTO THE EDITOR

Reader Attacks Columnist, Goldwater

Agrees With
Garfinkel

Editor, The Pitt News:

To an outsider, the system of
credits and requirements of the
University is very simple. Ac-
tually, for a student who can
pick the schedule best suited to
him with the exact requirements
.completely fulﬁlled, it is very
simple. But each day that I am
here I see more clearly that this
is not the case for a great many
students.

Many will agree with me and
Irv Garﬁnkel (Pitt News, Oct. 12,
1964, p. 4) that the system should

..be modiﬁed, especially where dis-

tribution credit requirements
pose problems. The moment a
student ﬁnds it necessary to drop
or .add a course, or choose elec-
tives for the coming trimester,
he is taking a risk.

He may very easily be mislead
by different departments, or giv-
en incorrect information. Such
was recently my case. It resulted
in a great loss of time on my
part when I had run from one
office to another until my situa-
tion was ﬁnally settled. Then I
found-that the problem lay in the
.lack ‘of coordination of the sys-
tem. If a student has such a
problem with a course, he will

. normally ask his professor for

advice. His advisor may tell him
something nearly contrary to
this. and if the problem involves
credits or grades for the course,
the Oﬂice of Student Records
may have still another opinion.
Who is to say which advice to
take? In my case, nearly received
an '1'” Grade for a course be-
cause I followed advice given me
when I asked for help.

If there must be rules govern-
ing Changing courses or require-

 ,ments for distribution credits,

they should be made welhknown

Editor, The Pitt News:

Using the twisted logic upon which our‘ Gold-
waterite friends rely so heavily, Mr. Alex D’Ip-
polito has managed to equate Billy Mitchell, ex-
ponent of air power in an age of bottle ships,
with Barry Goldwater(’exponent of manned air-

craft in an age of missiles.

Piloted aircraft can be used in modern war-
fare to, among other things, mount a massive
nuclear retaliatory attack, deﬁned against at-
tacking enemy aircraft and to ﬁght “brushﬁre

wars.”

But, missiles are rapidly making bombers ob-
solete and until they can be relied upon we
are maintaining more than adequate long range
bomber forces. The Russians themselves are not

terceptor cannot defend against a missile attack.

This would seem to indicate that development
and production of more bombers and interceptors
would be only wasted.

Sen. Goldwater, then, has been concerned only
with our ability to wage and‘ all-out war. Our

ability to engage in conﬂict on a limited scale

seemsto be of little importance to him. But, of
course, his supporters will reply, Communism is
the only enemy of freedom in the world today.
Communism and communists are everywhere

the same. There is only one way to deal with

relying upon aircraft to deliver a nuclear attack,
but are emphasizing missiles. A supersonic in-

them; massive force!

The Goldwater position on this issue_ under-
scores another factor inﬂuencing conservative
thinking; ignorance of change. '

Education

tribution credits are much. too
strict) cannot give exact infor-
mation without going to great
lengths and wasting much val-

In an otherwise progressive

Requirements

‘ O O
Called too Rigid
Editor, The Pitt News:

Mr. Garﬁnkel has expressed
Very well one of the most seri-
ous academic problems of the
University—the rigidity of distri-
bution of studies requirements.

When the student must take a
course because of its number
rather than because he feels it
will be of genuine beneﬁt to him,
his education suffers. Those who
make such rigid requirements do
not take into account individual
diﬁerences nor do they give the
student credit for being able to

   

- ion of

administration of the school of
liberal arts, the Liberal Arts
Cabinet, and Student Government
should attack this problem and
solve it.

The solution is as Mr. Garﬁnkel
states, “It should be possible to
substitute a more advanced
course for the present 80's or
180's introductory courses.” Per-
haps a compromise could be
worked out, such as allowing a

student to take an advanced ,

course if he can secure the in-
structor’s permission. The fact
that in Mr. Garﬁnkel’s case, the
administration would not permit
his taking Econ 11 for distribu-
tion even with the consent of the
instructor and the department
head shows an amazing and
alarming lack of respect for and
conﬁdence in the teaching fac-
ulty on the part of the adminis-
tration.

Student Blasts

‘Modern’ Dance
Editor, The Pitt News:

It is my opinion, and the opin-
P that the

   
 
  

key “to really goo

is, to have most of the people in
attendance having fun and danc-
ing.

Are the people who are gyrat-
ing to fast dance, after fast dance,
after fast dance, doing calisthen-
ics or trying to have the “Great
Spirit” bring rain?

Over one half of the people at-
tending dances, line the walls of
the ballroom, waiting for a nice
slow dance. Wait they must be-
cause the slow dance is rarely
played.

Fast dancing is ﬁne and fun, if
it is in equal proportion to slow
dancing. When slow dances are
played, the ﬂoor is ﬁlled with
happy couples. When the fast
songs are blared out, the ﬂoor is
not quite half-full.

Why, you may ask. Maybe peo-
ple like slow dancing better than
fast dancing. Maybe most people
can’t do fast dances. Maybe some.
students have reached a point‘
where they see that the body mo-
tions in fast dances look terrible.

The musicians or disc jockey
should cater to the majority of
dancers — soft, light, low music

lovers. An equal proportion be- '

tween slow and fast dances is the
dg dances.

Current ‘News’

Editor, The Pitt News:

As a reader of The Pitt News for
the last three years, I would like
to compliment you for starting it
back on a path to interesting
reading and responsible report-
ing. '

It is a relief to see our school
newspaper is no longer an in-
strument of a few politically-
minded “liber.ators” or a sound-
ing board for egoes and social

' ends.

The responsibility of a campus
newspaper seems to be under-
stood and respected this year,
and I now can honestly say I
look forward to reading The Pitt
News.

Beat Howard, 2-0

By BILL CABIN

WASHINGTON, D. C.—The fancy dribbling .and long kicking of the Howard
University soccer team was not enough to overcome- the persistent play of the Pan-'
thers, as they downed the Bisons, 2-0, last Saturday on the rain-soaked turf of Howard
Stadium. '

“It was a strong team effort, and we persisted in breaking up their attacks,”
said coach Leo Bemis. “If they’d fake one of us, another guy would ﬁll in immediate-
ly. As a result, we broke up more of their plays and our halfbacks and linemen were
able to control mid-ﬁeld. '

Aldo Zortea broke the scoring deadlock after ﬁne minutes of the second
half, as he cut across from his right wing slot to pick up a throw-in from the left.
With six minutes remaining, Joe Meyers, who had been alternating at inside right,
scored his ﬁrst goal of the season, charging in from mid-ﬁeld to pick up George
Shimpino’s shot off goalie Cosmo Williams.

Although a constant drizzle pervaded the game, several puddles were on the

 ﬁeld, the booter’s defense played their men well. Our defense played a big part in
7;; the victory,” said Bemis.

- “Wing fullbacks Cal Bonawitz and Art Richardson played well. They didn’t
charge their men, but held off and forced them to pass, which is the only way to
play in that kind of weather. Halfback George Sommers constantly took head balls
from his man, and goalie Ken Lang drove and covered the ball well.” Lang had

eight saves.

“Pitt is much better than West
Chester,” said Howard coach Jim
Chambers, who had lost to West
Chester the week before in dou-
ble overtime 1-0. .

With the booter’s record now
4-1, hopes are high for a NCAA
play-off berth. The team will be

Undefeated Harriers

Mazurek Held
In First Half

By BOB.SMIZ1K

MIAMI, Fla.—-Charlie Tate, Uni-
versity of Miami football coach, is a
large, gregarious man with the kind
of Southern accent writers say can
be sliced with a knife. Ask him a
question and you are liable to get ten min-
utes of jokes, cliches, slaps-on-the back and
eventually an answer.

In the Orange Bowl dressing room here
Saturday night Tate was his usual affable
self. “I told my boys I was real proud of
them after the game. They’re coming along
real ﬁne.”

Across the ﬁeld stood John Michelosen:
a study in contrast. From Michelosen there
was no back-slapping and no jokes, .al-
though there seldom are. There were cliches;
but there always are. But Saturday some-
times there weren’t even answers.

Such contrasting attitudes indicate a Mi-
ami route, but the ﬁnal score was 20-20.
Charlie Tate had the .answer to this, though.
“Pitt tied us,” he said. “We sure didn’t tie
them.”

Miami sure didn’t. It took Eric Crab-
tree, looking more and more Paul Mar-
thaish every game, to tie this one for the
Panthers. It took all of Crabtree’s speed
and elusiveness to break away 67 yards
on a quick pitch to the short of the ﬁeld
to give the Panthers a tie with 4:27 left
in the game.

Mention of Crabtree’s run brought a
glimmer to Michelosen’s dead pan. “It look-
ed like he might be caught for a loss,” the
Panther coach said. “But he got to the line
of scrimmage and then got outside. He made
two nice fakes to break away. It was a tre-
mendous individual effort.”

Jim Jones was not up_ to Crabtree’s ef-

forts as he missed the extra point which

would have given the Panthers the win
after Crabtree’s score. It was his ﬁrst miss
of the season in six tries.

For a while it didn’t look like Jones
would get a chance to do any extra point
kicking. The Hurricanes had a 13-0 lead
with more than six minutes left in the ﬁrst
half.

The ﬁrst Miami score came when Andy
Sixkiller took a Pete Billey punt on his
own 29-yard-line and quickly sped through
the entire Panther team. According to Mich-
elosen, “Billey was the safetyman on the
side of the ﬁeld the play went. But I don’t

quarterback Bob Biletnikoff after the Mi-
ami speedster made a short gain.

know whether he was taken out on the
play or not.” With the large number of
blue shirts on the ground there was a good

chance Billey was one of them.

There were blue shirts on the ground
for much of the first half and they were
usually on the bottom as the Hurricance
line made shambles of the Panther for-
ward wall and‘ in turn made Fred Map
zurek look like a third-rate quarterback.

Mazurek’s total offense in the ﬁrst half
was minus nine yards. It'Wasn’t until Ken-
ny Lucas took over the team at the end of
the half that the Panthers moved in for a
score. Lucas passes to Mitch Zalnasky and
Bob Rosborough highlighted the drive with
sophomore Rosborough scoring the touch-
down on an_eight-yard-pass from Lucas.

Mazurek started getting some coopera- 0

tion in the second half and moved the team
for a third quarter score with Barry Mc-
Knight plunging over from one yard out.
Jones’ placement gave the P.anthers a short-
lived 14-13 lead. The Hurricanes scored
after the next kickoff to go ahead 20-14

and it stayed that way until Crabtree made

his clutch run.

The Panthers now have a 2-2-1 record
with Navy, Syracuse, Notre Dame, Army
and Penn State yet to play. Crabtree and
Generalovich will need more help than
they had Saturday night to do as well in
the second half of the season as they did
in the first half.

Conquer Ohio State

The harriers won their ﬁfth straight meet, outdistanc-
ing Ohio'State, 20-44, Saturday at Columbus. Only one meet,
with West Virginia in two weeks, stands between theiPan-
thers and their ﬁrst undefeated season in many years.

The runners yielded ﬁrst place. to Ohio State’s Tom

Smith, who- was clocked at 20:15 for the four mile course, ~

but monopolized the next seven places for themselves.

Damien Koch crossed second; “John Bailey, third;
Dave Eichenlaub and Don Hinchberger, fourth; Fran Shor
and Frank Handleman, sixth, and Ralph Basinski, seventh.

In last yea.r’s Ohio State meet, Bailey and Eichenlaub
tied for ﬁrst.

Coach Jim Banner must count the strong showing of
three of his sophomores—Larry Hubner, Frank Handleman
and Fran Shor—as one of the main reasons for this year’s
success story.

“I saw most of them run in high school,” said Banner.
“They weren’t champions, just good high school runners.
‘But they’ve been running further now in college and prac-

 

ed by many to be one _of the ﬁnest ever assembled at Pitt, 

couldn’t quite convince the Kent State Frosh as ‘the Little
Flashes swamped the Cubs, 50-20, Thursday night at Kent.

“It was just a nightmarish night,” said Coach Bill Kali-

den. “It’s a hard way to learn .a
lesson, but I still think we have
a good group. They may well
grow into Pitt’s best team yet.”

Kent ﬁelded 64 players in the
first year that they have done any
active recruiting in football. “We
decided to move in football this
year and I think this game shows
that we’ve made a pretty good
start,” commented Kent coach
Larry Lorton.

Within ten minutes one play-
er, Bill Blunt, a ﬁve-foot eight,
163 pound high school all-
American from Massillon, Ohio,
felt more at home in the end
zone than on the ﬁeld, scoring
three touchdowns.

His first score came on a 22
yard sweep around left end. Two
minutes later, it was Blunt in-

. a-,. Bob;.Bazylak pass

and running it back 55 yards for
the TD. Five play later, Blunt
took quarterback Ron Swartz’s
pass 31 yards to the Pitt 39. On

the next play Blunt caught a _

touchdown pass.
“That’s what happens when
you don’t have enough time to
concentrate on defense. We’re

nmning offensive plays all the
time against the varsity and
you can’t learn defense by ,
looking at the drawings.”

The Cubs’ ﬁrst tally came mid-
way through the third quarter
when Gerald Rife grabbed Mike
Elliott’s deﬂected pass for a 33
yard TD. The ﬁnal two scores
came in the fourth period when
Elliott passed 15 yards to end
Bob Longo and sneaked over him-
self from one yard out for the
closing score.
