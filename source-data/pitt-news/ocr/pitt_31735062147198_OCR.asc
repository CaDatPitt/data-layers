Weekly’s Criticism Of Cathedral
Based On False Information,

BULLETIN

According to information received
yesterday by The Pitt News from
Dr. Marion K. McKay, head of the
department of economics, the action
of tlhe AAUP which placed the Uni-
versity on its ineligible list does not
carry with it any provision dismiss-
ing any of the association’s mem-
bers who take positions with the
University_

Dr. McKay yesterday received
verification of this fact, a direct con-
tradiction of all newspaper reports
and likewise of statements appear-
ing in reprinted editorial comments
in today’s issue of The News, from
the Executive Committee of the
AAUP.

Thus the only penalty concerned
with ineligibility is that the organi-
zation will receive no new mem-
bers from the University. Dr. Mc-
Kay added that the association will
be more anxious to remove the Uni-
versity from the ineligible list than
it was to impose the charges.

By Leo Koeberlein

Relax, let your imagina.tion wander,
and read some excerpts from a cur-
rent fabrication in the January 11 is-
sue of News Week. The article is
titled: “Professors’ Group Taboos
Cathedral of Learning,” and comes
under the general heading of Educa-
tion, The excerpts follow:

1. “In the past ﬁve years 25 (facul-
ty members) have been ﬁred and 59
have resigned.”

2. “Today the Cathedral of Learn-
ing cleaves Pittsburgh’s murky sky.
Nine hundred teachers instruct 9,325
pupils on the only three completed
classroom floors, the 4th, 5th and 6th.
The pounding of air drills punctuates
I heaters
provide warmth in classrooms, some
of which are entered by gangplanks
across steel girders.”

3. “Students remember he (Chan-
cellor Bowman) forbids smoking or
wearing hats in his cathedral.”

These are only a few of the amus-
ing remarks which the author of the
article used as a background to what
he called the “moral stigma” of the
recent AAUP ruling.

Several Errors Appear

While it is hardly necessary to go
over the details to point out to inti-
mates of the campus the obvious err-
ors which the article contained, here
are some of the facts which News

‘Week attempted to review:

,1. In the past ﬁve years, two, not
25, faculty members have been ﬁred

' and 22 have resigned. Some of these

were able to secure more important
positions at schools, where such po-
sitions were vacant. Others were
graduate assistants at the University
who were appointed to the staffs of
other schools as instructors and as-

sistant professors.

2. Today the Cathedral does
“cleave Pittsburgh murky sky”—the
only true statement in the paragraph.
Where, this writer wonders, did News
VVeek get its information that only
three classroom ﬂoors are used to in-
struct 9,325 pupils. What about the
other buildings on the campus? How

Fine Arts Movies
Show Film Throes

Early Foreign Pictures Judged
Superior By Reviewer

By Robert Saffron

In nine reels illustrating the “De-
velopment of Narrative—: 1894 to
1911," the audience at the ﬁl1I1-sl1ow-
ing by the department of ﬁne arts
Monday evening saw some of the
throes in which the movies were born.

The acting, or more properly, the
emoting, was ludicro-us when it meant
to be so and some-times more ludi-
crous when it didn’t mean to. The
photography was ruthlessly realistic
and a little jerky.

“The Execution of Mary Queen of
Scots” (1893) started out as a ﬁlm for
a peep-show but was projected on a
screen in February, 1894, so that after
1895 films were commonly shown on
screens. This little drama portrayed
the execution of the queen in all its
glory, with the head rolling off and all.
The only objection to be made_ per-
haps, is that the head came off too
smoothly and unnaturally.

“Wash Day Troubles” (1895) re-
lieved the tragedy with some of the
earliest known slap-stick comedy. The
theme of a woman washing and a boy
upsetting the tub was used to good
advantage by Mack Sennett years
later.

The foreign ﬁlms‘ were distinctly
superior at this time as “shown by “A
Trip to the Moon” (1902) made by
the Frenchman, George Melies. Me-
lies, a. magician, ﬁrst made use of
stop-motion photography to produce a
gayly fantastic narrative of a trip
to the moon in a rocket. His close-
up of the rocket as it smacked into
the pie-faced moon and the moon clos-
ing up one eye as though hurt was
the best of the evening.

“The Great Train Robbery” (1903)
and “Faust” (1905) were more highly
developed in that the motion was
away and towards the camera in-
stead of only horizontally as before.
In both ﬁlms, the actors were highly
emotional, employing gestures and
contortions to leave very little to the
imagination.

“Queen Elizabeth" (1911) with
Madame Bernhardt as Elizabeth add-
ed considerably to the prestige of the
new art because of the leading lady's
fame. The picture was more a pho-to-
graphed play than a drama conceived
in terms of the cinema. Madame
Bernhardt, therefore, thought nothing
of taking a curtain call after the ﬁnal
scene in which she died.

The death was well arranged; the
queen quivered, scornfully pushed
aside a courtier who reached to hold
her_up, and then fell headlong onto a
pile of pillows at the foot of her
throne. But, on the whole, the acting
was IIIQI-‘Ci; subtle. The part of her
lover, incidentally, wa.s -taken by Lou
Tellegen, who committed" suicide a
short time ago. '

Economic Trends Outlined

At First Group X Program

In a spirited talk at the ﬁrst meet-
ing of the new Group X series, 0, W.
Mason, reader’s counselor at Carne-
gie LlbI‘alV.V, outlined the major
trends of the present economic sys-
tem, and pointed out how these trends
would affect the future employment
of the average college graduate.

Aside from being an authority on
the literature of today, Mr, Mason is
an expert on the cooperative move-
ment which he estimates will play an
important role in American history
during the next quarter century.

“The younger generation has a
tough job ahead,” he remarked. “Nev-
ertheless, I envy the youth of today,
because there is such a rich oppor-
tunity for him to open new ﬁelds and
vacations. The next 25 years will be

a kind of proving ground for every-
one.”

Mr. Mason warned the group against
taking jobs for granted. He believes
that there is still much room in what
he calls the “time-honored profes-
sions;” for example, law, the ministry,
medicine, dentistry, business and so
forth. He insisted, however, on the
college youth’s assurance that he pos-
sesses sufficient ability to “come out
on top of the pile.”

“I believe that jobs exist for the
person with adaptability. The man
with set ideas, old-fashioned notions,

and no individuality, is doomed to fail
in the high-powered competition of to-
day. Personality is a great factor in
getting any kind of job,” he said.

Again, Mr. Mason believes that
there will be found tremendous oppor-
tunity in the rural ﬁeld. It is his
opinion that there will soon be evi-
dent a back-to-the country movement.
He believes that "factories will soon
be built out of the city, and that, ﬁg-
uratively speaking, grass will grow
in many city streets. To back up his
opinion, he thinks that the city of
Pittsburgh could be effectively run
with a population of 35,000 people.

Mr. Mason is also of the opinion
that the person with two ﬁelds of
knowledge has a better chance for
success than the person with only one
ﬁeld.

“The graduate of law school who
has a working knowledge of surgery
is almost certain to land a position
with one of the law ﬁrms,” he declar-
ed. “Similarly, many ministers are
excellently schooled in social science,
philosophy, history, and other cultural
subjects, instead of merely being
graduates of a theological school.”

Next week, there will be given an-
other talk by Glenn U. Cleeton, head
of the department of industrial educa-
tion, at Carnegie Tech. The meeting
will be held in the conference room of
the new YMCA headquarters, Room
801, Cathedral. The co-chairmen of
the series are Chalmers Brown, Ed37,
and Willard Ross, C38. The meeting
will be open to all men students.

Choose Your Story Concerning Prom
From Committee’s Lengthy List

Today we're going to leave it up to
you.

After all, you shell out the three
bucks for the ticket; why shouldn’t

you have any say in what sort of
stories you are to rea.d about the Jun-
ior Prom? VVe take it for granted
that you are reading this story.

Your choice (all you have to do is
pick out what you consider most im-
portant and most likely to attract the
attention of readers, and then stick it
at the top as the lead) lies among:

1. Miss Jean Seaton will be Queen
again to Grand Monarch William
Schenck, chairman. This combin-
ation will soon be as predictable
as that of Keiser-Brown. Miss Seaton
is a senior at PCW. You will see

her picture in the next issue of The
Pitt News.

2. One of the Prom’s original car-
toons has been stolen from the ﬁrst
ﬂoor of the Cathedral. The cartoon
pictures a couple waving in vain for
taxis which were all ﬁlled with Junior
Prommers. Anyone who returns it
with an assured sale of ten tickets
wi'l be given a comp.

3. Bill Tilden himself will be an
honored guest at the Junior Prom,
bringing with him his own racquets
Bob Madden has promised to bring
him along directly after the match.

At the end of your story don’t for-
get to state that the formal dance
takes place Friday night from 10 to 2
o’clock in the Hotel Schenley Ball-
room.

Dr. Jordan Finds Astronomy
Of Writers Is Unscientiﬁc

T

Mistakes Of Coleridge,

Poe Supply Theme
For Article

If writers must make use of the
moon, eclipses, stars, they should
ﬁrst look up the facts in order that
they may avoid doing things with
stellar bodies which would turn the
youngest astronon1er’s hair grey after
the ﬁrst chapter. '

Dr. Frank C. Jordan, director of
the Allegheny Observatory, in a re-.
cent article in the Journal of the Mn-
seum of Natural History, New York,
cites some of the human, but certainly
amusing blunders that many writers
have made.

For instance, H. Rider Haggard in
“King Solomon’s Mines” Whisks :1’
total eclipse of the sun out of his lit-
erary bag of tricks to facilitate the
escape of a group of whites from a
pursuing band of savages. The hitch,
Dr. Jordan points out, is that the
eclipse
omical Hoyle: the maximum perio,dj
for any eclipse is seven minutes.

Samuel Taylor Coleridge falls foul

of Dr. Jordan’s analysis. In his “The
Rime of the Ancient Mariner” he
speaks of,

1‘
o

. . The horned moon, with one
bright star

Within its nether tip.”

According to Dr. Jordan, it is im-
possible for a star to shine between
the tips of a crescent moon for two
reasons: (1) the dark part of the
moon is that part of the surface of
the moon which is in shadow, and (2)
there aren’t any stars between the
earth and the moon and therefore
none could pass in front of the dark-
ened surface.

Make Moon Do Tricks

“Gene Stratton Porter,” continues
Dr. Jordan, “in her very delightful
n'ovels_plays fast and loose with the
moon. She can have it shining when-
ever and wherever she pleases, and it
can do strange things. At one place
in “The Harvester” the half moon is
just at the tree tops on the western
horizon, which is quite proper. But
later in the night it has risen clear
off the trees a.nd is ﬂooding the coun-
try with light. This is, of course, im-
possible, for the moon never rises in
the west. In another place it is stat-
ed that the moon every night made a
bridge of light across a small lake.
This could happen for a few nights,
but not indeﬁnitely.”

Edgar Allan Poe writes about fun-
nels of maelstroms but Dr. Jordan
corrects him with the fact that the
maelstrom forms no funnel. Poe has
a full moon shining directly overhead
in Norway on July 1 but, according
to Dr. Jordan the moon at the time
would be barely above the southern
horizon for an observer in Norway.

Dr. Jordan also has a word to say
for artists. “It always worries an
astronomer to see a painting in which
the horns of the moon are directed to-
ward the horizon, yet this is a com-
mon error. Actually they should
point away from the horizon, because
they always point away from the sun,
which is below the horizon at night.
Artists may see more than the aver-
age person, but they do not always
see the heavens correctly.”

Mendenhall Shows Slides
Of Native Life In India

Slides portraying native life in India
were shown and explained’ to mem-
bers of the Monday Freshman Club
by W. W. Mendenhall, executive sec-
retary of the University YMCA and
sponsor of the group at the regular
meeting Monday noon. The pictures
were taken by Mr. lvlendenhall while
he was serving with the British army
in India during the World War.

The luncheon meeting was the ﬁrst
held by the club since the removal
of the Y headquarters from the Y Hut
to the Cathedral, and took place in
the temporary new headquarters in
the Oakland YMCA.

‘ To Him That Hath, ’ Says
King. ‘Nuts,’ Say Others

On Monday, some of the boys
were holding a raffle for a ticket
to the Junior Prom. I11 walked
Bi-ll Schenck, chairman of the
dance, and they sandbagged him
for a dime to help make up the
quota of chances. The boys were
anxious to learn who would get to
the dance on ten cents.

When the tense moment of the
drawing came, what number should
be dra.w11 from the hat but the one
held by Schenck. Even Schenck
could hardly believe it.

But the Prom King turned back
the ticket. He ﬁgured he might
be able to get i11 anyway Friday
night.

On Cathedral’s Fourth, Fifth
Floors Nears Completion

Incorporating the last word in de-
vices for the comfort and convenience
of students, the new home of the
University library will be opened
early in the spring on the fourth and
ﬁfth ﬂoors of the Cathedral.

The fourth ﬂoor painting and ﬁnish-
ing is nearly completed. Flooring has
been installed in the reference stack
room. The shelves in the stack room

are of metal construction. Each
stack is equipped with individually
controlled lights and a folding writing
table is mounted at the head of each
row of shelves. The room is divided
into an upper and - lower ; decks of
stacks, so that all the available space
can be utilized. Additional shelves
will be- added on the Fifth Avenue and
Belleﬁeld Avenue sides.

On the ﬁfth ﬂoor work is being
rushed to complete interior decora-
tion. The periodical room, facing
Forbes Street, will contain many
current magazines and newspapers,
arranged on especially constructed
shelves around the edge of the room.
A beamed ceiling, with black and gold
trim, is included. Large davenports
and lounge chairs will be scattered
about the room.

Included in the appointments will
be a charging counter, several special-
ly constructed octagon tables, many
upholstered chairs, and-reference’ and
dictionary tables. Off the main room
will be a periodical storage room
where a complete ﬁle of all periodicals
will be kept. .

Individual Rooms Planned

The delivery room, on the Belleﬁeld
Avenue side, will be equipped to se-
cure quickly books desired by the
student. A book elevator will com-
municate with the reference stacks on
the ﬂoor below. The top of the eleva-
tor shaft will be enclosed ina'~Got‘hic
paneled cabinet. Around the elevator
will be the main desk.

Long leather lounges will be group-
ed in the center. Shelves will be in-
stalled in the pillars of the vaulted
ceiling. An unusual feature will be
the two individual study rooms design-
ed for one or two students for quiet
study.

The reference room, one of the larg-
est in the library group. will be locat-
ed on the side facing Bigelow Boule-

be a double arch. The pillars, sup-
porting the vaulted ceiling, will con--
tain spe‘ciallly ‘designed book shelves
to harmonize with the interior of the
room. Additional shelves will be
placed around the sides of the room.
Study tables will be located between
the side shelves. Lounges will be
grouped near the front and rear of‘
the room.
Cloak, Check Roomslncluded,

Between the reference room andthe
periodical room will be a cloak room»
and check room. Th‘e'i5eqi1ipinent¢~will

lic catalog room will have complete
listings of all books available to stu-
dents.

The entrances to stairways have
been equipped with new metal doors.
All ﬁfth ﬂoor library doors will be
of wood-panel construction.

The present political tendency of
the Roosevelt regime is a “groping
toward a new social system and a
new economic conception,” writes Dr.
Roger V. Shumate, instructor in po-
litical science, in an article appearing
in the latest issue of The Southwest-
ern Social Science Quarterly.

In his article on the foundations
and signiﬁcance of the New Deal,
Dr. Shumate stresses its political
philosophy as being built from a new
social system and a new economic
conception. “We must view the New
“Deal,” asserts Dr. Shumate, as “the
American counterpart though a some-
what belated one, of the post-war
revolutions that have swept over other
lands.”

Dr. Shumate dismisses the so—called
“brain trust” as exercising mythical
sway, contending that this advisory
personnel has not devised a “con-
sistent and coherent philosophy of
government.”

The article, “The Political Philoso-
phy of the New Deal,” attributes the
inconsistency of the Roosevelt pro-
gram to the stress of the disastrous
depression. “It ‘was faced by a gang
of brutal facts, not a bevy of beautiful
theories. The President knew that
his election was, at least in part, the
result of a half-blind reaction against
an economic situation that was grow-
ing intolerable. His most immediate
task was in connection with relief and
recovery, rather than the reconstruc-

medicine.

Shumate Analyzes Policies,

Significance Of New Deal

Tracing the history of the term
New Deal, Dr. Shumate follows the
stages of its progress from a cam-
paign slogan and a buoy grasped by
the unemployed through its appear-
ance as the campaign , promise of
President Roosevelt. After bé'ing ad-
vocated by the vote of the people,
the New Deal now must be regarded
as the “record of the Roosevelt Admin-
istration in action.”

The New Deal, he says, assumes
that economic and social forces can
be directed to the betterment of the
masses and it has ambitiously at-
tempted to do so through govern-
mental action. “To its fatalistic ad-
versaries,” reﬂects Dr. Shumate, "it
must appear as audacious as would
a modern Joshua in bidding the sun
to stand still.”

From a government of protection the
administration is considered as chang-
ing into a government of performance
——shifting from the negative to the
positive role in the affairs of men.

Dr. Shumate concludes with a sum-
mary of the New Deal’s-ism. It has
drifted toward collectivism, em-
phasizing collective rather than in-
dividual welfare and responsibility for
relief. He labels the present struc-
ture of the government as a New
Liberalism, a compromise between
radical a.nd conservative tendencies.

Dr. Shumate has closely observed
the Roosevelt administration, having
spent the summer of 1935 in Wash-
ington where he studied the present

tion of a social system.”

result of this action on the part of the organization
ofcollegc officials the 12,000‘ members of the group
are «prohibited from teaching there.

“A member of the-Pitt: faculty ﬁnds himself in
an unhappy.situation. A professor trying to live
up to the high standards of his profession is se-
verely handicapped by the fact that anything that
he might say in his classroom that could possibly
be construed as ‘radical’ by the administration
w.ould.result in his being ousted;

“No man is at his best when he lives haunted by
fear of being ﬁred—especially in these times. On
the other hand it is not fair to the student.

“Faculty members at Pitt are hired for only the
p_,eriod“of 'a'ye-arat a time. I Anyone who does not
conform during "the period of a. year with the so-
called.‘standards’ of the University, ﬁnds himself
twithou-t a job the following fall. Professors there
areltotcacli as the administration dict.ates——‘or
else.-’

“One redeemable feature about Pitt—if it can
pass as such—is the fact that the institution does
turn out high powered football teams. Anniver-
sity is indeed in a sad plight when outsiders hear
only of its good football team a11d its suppression-
of . academic freedom.’ ’

_ (If they have an ear to the ground down-
there- in Morgantown, they certainly must
have forgotten to take off their ear-muffs.)

On The Other Hand

The following is -a letterto the editor, re-
printed from the Pittsburgh Press. Its
"thoughts are presented here, without extra
charge, as something of a. tonicfor. misled
West Virginians and for ‘some Pennsylvanians:

“The blacklisting of I the University of Pitts-

lburgh by the American Society of University Pro-

fessors has deﬁnitely decided me to send 1ny son to
Pitt.

“Any school good enough to earn the ire of this
group, who, through their senseless blacklist-ing of
splendid institutions are only blacklisting them-
selves, is surely a safe choice.

“Chancellor Bowman should be highly flattered
by the disapproval of this ‘liberal’ group who are
indeed so ‘liberal’ that they will permit no one to
mind his own business, and so bent on so-called
freedom for theinselves that they are determined
noone else shall have any.

“The trouble-making proclivities of the profes-
sors’ current pet, Dr. Turner. are something to
give thoughtful parents pause, and only one car on
his testimony at the ‘investigatioii’ was more than
sufficient to make one wonder not how he got out
of Pitt but how in the world he ever got in.

“The investigation of our university was a dis-
grace to the city of Pitfsburgli and to the state of
_Pcnnsylvan.ia, and Representative Herman Eber-
hartcr, who sponsored it, may ﬁnd that his name
has been significantly remembered by voting pa-
rents who cling to the strange conviction that re-
ligion. proven standards and traditional American
iclcals are still important things with which to in-
culcate youth, and who may wonder why Mr. Eber-
l1a.r’r.er was so excited about their dissemination.

“So while the ‘picketing professors,’ with their
battle-cry of ‘academic freedom’ (of which in its
proper interpretation there has never been the
slightest lack at Pitt), are busy trying to make it
a little harder for themselves to get jobs, let the
parents of this city be grateful for Chancellor
Bowman, who is perceptive enough to know that
freedom of thought and its-expression is one thing,
while freedom of ‘lack of thought’ is another and
is discerning enough to know the difference.”

P r i .2: e d M'cC-uﬁiey Books
Find Way To Large
Private Stock

Ancient texts from the days when
our grandfatliers climbed up the steps
of the one-room school are being col-
looted by Dr. John A. Nietz, assistant
professor of education. Dr. Nietz’s
collection numbers over 300 volumes
collected in Pittsburgli and the VVest-
ern Pennsylvania district.

Vvorking on the assumption that
schoolmasters of the last century
tauglit what their texts contained, Dr.
Nietz began his hobby some four
years ago with the purpose of study-
ing the teaching methods of the latter
18th a.nd 19th centuries. Second hand
book stores, used furniture, and an-
tique shops have yielded up most of
the collection. Many of his friends and
students have presented him with
copies of his ancient volumes.

VVitl1in the next year Dr. Nietz
expects to take up the work of com-
piling analyses of the early secular
ﬁelds of learning through graduate
assistants of the School of Educa-
tion. “There is a distinct need for
an analytical study of the evolution
of early education, and I believe that
these texts will open wide a source
of material,” Dr. Nietz maintained.

Of interest in the collection are the
one-volume readers, of which Mc-
Guffey’s is probably the best. known.
These readers, Dr. Nietz explained,
contain the entire curriculum of the
school. The oldest original edition in
the collection is the English Reader of
1779, written by Lindley Murray. This
was the ﬁrst reader used in America,
Dr. Nietz claimed. These old readers
had a biblical stamp which is reflect-
ed in the Old New England Reader
whose rhyming alphabet condemned
the students:

often does “the pounding of air drills
punctuate lectures?” And did the
News Week’s w-riter overlook the fact
that the Cathedral is now steam heat-
ed, and did he, himself walk across a
gangplank lying over steel girders to
get to a classroom that ‘is beingvused?

3. We hardly need to say that
there aren’t any “No Smoking” signs
in the Cathedral——nor are there any
regulations whatsoever! regarding the
wearing of hats.

Quoting “Patriarch” Wright
The article in News Week began

with the statement of Frank Lloyd

Wright, “patriarch of modern archi-
tecture,” that the -Cathedral is the
“. most stupendous keep—oﬁ-the-
g”ra‘ss sign I’ve ever seen.” '

This writer has no puritanical
views as to what the Cathedral's arch-
itecture should be, but.he can under-
stand its balance and the beauty-of
its Gothic lines. As for the grass,
if “patriarch” architect ‘Wright insists
the buildings is a‘ keep-off-the-grass
sign, grass itself deserves a pretty
big sign.
' And one more thing before the. ar-
ticle in News Week is permanently
forgotten: When this writer walks
into thenew library rooms on the Ca-
thedral’s ﬁfth ﬂoor--he is willing to
take off his hat without any signs to
tell him to. And he- stands ready at
any time to tour the Cathedral with

Readers, whose ﬁrs‘; edition dates
back to 1801, are to be found in the-
collection. The ﬁrst edition has not
been found in any collection, and is
being sought by many collectors
throughout the country. Dr. Nietz has
what he claims to be one of the earl-
iest readers of the l\-'lcGufl’ey series,
one which bears the publication date
of 1836. He has managed to collect
some seven or eight of the series
within the past few years.

Among the collection is a tattered
copy of the Latin text, Erasmi Collo-
quia Selecta, which includes the Latin
Catechism and the parallel English
translation. This edition was used
in eastern schools for at least 50
years. The text originally appeared
in 1516 in Great Britain, and was later
adopted, about 300 years ago, in the
Boston Latin Grammar School. Dr.
Nietz owns the edition of 1801.

“The early readers, written with the
idea of teaching reading and speaking,
contained chiefly passages chosen for
their elocution value. VVithin the con-
ﬁnes of one thin volume the old
schoolmaster taught spelling, reading,
geography, ethics, and history. The
book formed the complete course of
education,” Dr. Nietz remarked.

Forming a considerable portion of
the collection are the Osgood Readers,
contemporary with the McGuffey
These volumes were popular
in the schools and academies of VVest-
ern Pennsylvania from the middle of
the 19th century-to the beginning of

“It is the earlier books that hold the
most fascinating interest,” Dr. Nietz
said. He pointed out his copy of the
first geography used in America, writ-
ten by one Jcdidiah Morse. The “geog-
raphy” was based entirely on the Bi-
ble, and used as its foundation the
story of the creation of the world in
six days as related in Genesis of the
Old Testament. The Book of Psalms
is frequently quoted as scientiﬁc proof
for Moi-se‘s statements.

The earlier texts are naturally the
most elusive ones, yet Dr. Nietz has
managed to capture 50 volumes whose
combined age totals nearly 7,000
years. Some of the texts are repro-
ductions of early English editions dat-
ing back to 1516 and 1564. The ma-
jority. however, belong to the Amer-
ican period from 1779 to the 1850’s.

Intramural Boxing Tourney
Starts Off With Real Bangs

Two Kayoes Feature Opening Day Of Novice Bouts;
Russ Vogel W ins 115-Pound Championship

sj

By Leonard Levison

In bouts characterized by pleritv of fast and furious iist ﬁiiigiiig,

ﬁve aspiring ﬁsticuffers demonstrated some of the ﬁner points of the
inanljr art of self-defense and opened the fourth annual Intramural
Boxing Tournament Monday at the Stadium with clean-cut victories.

Two kayoes and the v.'i11ning' of a Cll‘rll‘.ll_)lOllSlllp featured the ﬁrst
da_v’s swift-moving activity. This afternoon at 4-. o’clock the ‘tourney
winds up with a batch of titles to be lianded out.

Opening up with a two-ﬁsted siegeé‘

tliar. ‘znzd Dick Conti on the ropes be-
fore the first round was over, Russ
Vogel blasted his way into the 115-
pound championsliip. After absorbing
a great deal of punishment in the ﬁrst
round, Conti made a gallant comeback
and earned a draw in the ﬁnal round.
But Vogel’s punching earlier in the
contest won the unanimous acclaim
of both judges and the referee.
Ralph Carouso, freshman slugman,
furnished the afternoon’s biggest
ﬁair when he exploded a right hand
packed with dynamite on Bill Blair in
the ﬁrst round of a 135-pound tussle.
Jumping out of his corner with the
bell, Carouso waited scarcely 30 sec-
onds before he planted his gloved ﬁst
squarely in Blair's solar plexus. With
his breathing action almost
paralyzed, Blair went down for a
count of ten and was hardly able to

stand on his feet for a good many

minutes after he left the ring.

The other knockout was registered
by another freshman in the 135-pound
class. Herman Laub" lambasted Patsy
Zitelli to the canvas in the second
round for a count of three. When
Zitelli went down he bumped his head
on the canvas and. arose wobbling.
The bout was stopped when Zitelli
was unable to answer the bell for the
last call and Laub was awarded a
technical knockout decision.

Bill Ryan scored a victory over Tom
McKenna in the closest battle staged.
Ryan showed a. slight superiority in
the ﬁrst and second rounds, but by
the ﬁnal round both men were stag-
gering around the ring and a solid
blow would have ﬁnished the match
in short order.

Herb Turner boxed out a decisive
win over danceman Fred Kelly» in
the remaining contest. Kelly showed
an intricate piece of Cap and Gown
footwork, but Turner had the situation
well in hand and kept his man at bay
with a steady stream of left jabs.
This was another 145-pound scrap.

Mike Ianuzzi was the third man in
the ring, with Joe Kopp, and Wee
Vvillie Davies serving as judges. Box-
ing coach Jack Shricker was in full
command of the proceedings although
he only served officially as time-
keeper.

Fighters Prepare
To - Box Oranges

Panthers Face Strong Syracuse
Team On Saturday Evening

The finishing touches are being ap-
plied to the collection of jabs, hooks,
crosses, and clinches which the box-
ing team will unloose against the
Orange mittmen at Syracuse, Satur-
day night. Coach Schricker and VVillie
Davies are putting the Pitt boxers
through strenuous drills in prepara-
tion for‘ the dual meet on Saturday.

The starting lineup for Syracuse
will probably ﬁnd Frank Cimicata,
diminutive bantamweight for the
Orange, starting the first boutiof the
evening. In the 125-pound class, Al
Duke is another probable starter. The
third weight class will ﬁnd a fairly
certain start.er in Freddy Zuccaro.

Johnny Mastrella, a newcomer to the
Orange squad, and hailed as one of
the ﬁnest boxers ever to enter the
University of Syracuse is sure of a
chance to see action against the Pitt
‘mittmen in the 145-pound .division.
McGivern To Help Orange

Artie McGivern, intercollegiate
champion, although" in poor shape for
the coming bout, will be seen in the
155-pound event. Ord Fink, a hard
hitting 165-pounder, will be found in
the ring for this event.

When the light-heavyweights of the
two schools tangle, Jack Lipani will
be wearing the Orange uniform. Cap-
tain Ray Jefferies, although a light-
heavyweight, will be ﬁghting in the
heavyweight class because of a
vacancy caused by the loss of Jim
Brown to the squad for an indeﬁnite
period.

Coach Schricker is out for revenge
for the defeat last year by the Orange
boxers. The ﬁnal score of last year's
event was 6%-1%.

Swimmers Train For Initial Start
In ESA League On Friday Night

Meet Delaware Team On Friday;
Ohio State Speedsters Swamp
Varsity Mermen, 55-13

VVith the Ohio State meet a matter
of history now, Coach Pat Corr has
been sending the varsity swimmers
through stiff workouts to get them in
top shape for the Delaware outﬁt
which comes to town Friday. for a.
meet with the Panthers.

Corr never expected his Pitt team
to win the Ohio State meet, but he

hoped to get a line on the strength of
the squad from that opening competi-
tion. Since the boys have been
through the mill now, he has been con-
centrating their attention on the re-
spective events in which they were
participants.

Tom Locke and Russ Lindberg,
judged by their performance against
the topnotch Buckeye crew, are ap-
parently headed for big seasons,
while Prince. Gever, Anderson, Jones.
and the rest of the men are expected
to reach top form as the season pro-
gresses.

Red McQuillan, fancy diving expert,
has been forced to the sidelines due
to illness. and it is doubtful whether
343 will be able to participate on Fri-

ay.

The Panthers walloped the east-
erners by a 50-18 verdict last winter
and will be out to repeat on Frida.y
evening. This will be their ﬁrst meet-
ing with an Eastern Swimming Asso-
ciation team this season.

Buckeyes Win, 55-13

Ohio State's varsity swimming team
lived up to all the nice things that we
said about it. and the result was a
55-13 setback for the Pitt natators in
their ﬁrst start of the season at the
Metropolitan pool last Saturday eve-
ning. The same thin.-‘I can be said for
the Fifth Avenue high school outﬁt,
for it upset the Little Panthers by a
36 to 28 margin.

Led by Dexter \Voodford, who re-
sembles a Gar Wood speedboat in ac-
tion. and Pat Patterson, national jun-
ior diving champion. the Buckeyes
walked off with ﬁrst honors in every
varsity event. Woodford swam
anchor position on the 400-yard relay
team and took first in the 220 and
4-10-yard freestyle contests. Patterson
easily cm_)tured the diving event.

Faulkenstein in the 50-yard free-
style, Smith in the 150-yard hack-
stroke. Kessler in the 100. and Kirbert
in the 200-yard breaststroke were the
other Ohioans who aided the State
temn in monopolizing ﬁrst place posi-
tions.

For Pitt some consolation can be
gathered from the performance of
Tom Locke. sophomore star, who gave
Vvoodford probably the closest call
he’d had in the 440 event for some
time. Swimming in his first varsity
meet. Locke led throughout most of
the race only to be touched out at
the ﬁnish line. Locke also took sec-
ond honors in the 220-yard event.

The yearlings had a chance to tie

their meet by-capturing the medley re-
lay, but they failed, consequently they
had to~be satisﬁed‘ with a 36-28 de-
feat. Walt Nowotny with two ﬁrsts
led the scorers.

Panthers Go East On Third Trip;
Battle Penn State Saturday

A greatly changed Panther basket-
ball team leaves Pittsburgh Friday
morning on a weekend road tour that
shows the Panthers meeting George-
town University in Vvashington, D. C.,
Friday night, and the Penn State
Lions at State College on the follow-
ing day.

Two straight defeats on their home
door by teams which the Panthers
were supposedly to have held a jinx
over have put the Golden Cats in any-
thing but a friendly mood. The re-
verses also seem to have acted as a
tonic and wakened the boys out of
any southern trance they may have
fallen into on the New Orleans trip.

It was just two weeks ago that the
Panthers and Dr. Carlson returned
from the balmy south sporting a Sugar
Bowl Cup and an impressive record of
ﬁve triumphs and one loss on the
trip. Then, after they instructed the
South in this game of basketball, they
proceeded to take lessons on the Sta-
dium floor from the Irish and Tech.

It may be that the road trip took
more than a little out of the boys or
that it put too much conﬁdence in
them; anyway, the basketball played
in the Stadium this past week cer-
tainly looked.anything but impressive.
In both games there was a listless-
ness, an inconsistent spirit, and an
unnaturally. poor" defense on‘ the part
of the Jungle Cats.

With six days in which to rest up
for the games this week, the Panthers
aim to get back into their winning
ways once more. The Georgetown
tiltmarks the second showingof Dr.
Carlson’s boys in. an Eastern Inter-'
collegiate Conference game, the Panth-
ers having dropped the ﬁrst to Carne-
gie Tech. It has been many a moon
since the Capital City ﬁve has had
enough to down the Panthers, so a
close contest is expected in Friday
night's battle.

After Georgetown has been taken
care of, or vice versa, the Panthers
move upto State College to resume
the Panther-Lion series, Saturday
night. Last year, Dr. Carlson and his
Panthers tamed the Lions, 41-25.

This season, the State team. has
lost only one, that being last week
when the Navy ﬁve tripped them‘ in
avclose game, 36-30. They- have a
fast, clever team led. by Mike Kor-
nick, an all-around athletic who stars
in baseball, basketball and football.

This, too, will be an Eastern Inter-
collegiate Conference tilt, marking
the ﬁrst appearance of the State team
in this league.

Dr. Carlson will take the usual ten
players on the trip. These are: Cap-
tain Ted‘R0derick, Rags Radvansky,
Pete Noon, Bob Johnson, Joe Garcia,
Bill Jesko, Myles Zeleznick, Ed Spot-
o'vich, Frank Loucks, and Luke
Rowe. The Panther freshman team
will meet the State frosh in the pre-
liminary to the varsity game Satur-
day night.

Opening Meet On January 25 Precedes Senior AMA-

Card; Oden Pushes Bennett In High Jump

Just ten days from today, Coach Olson.’s entire track squad
opens the indoor campaign ag'a.inst the crack district runners in the
AMA championships, a. University-sponsored event scheduled for the

track house, January 25.
’l‘he latest word from John T.

Taylor, secretary-treasurer of the

AMA and entry chairman, indicates tli-at. a large ﬁeld of trackmen
will compete for the district indoor titles which will be at stake,

starting at 2 o’clock on this date.
‘According to the entry sheet, this
meet acts as a prelude to the Sen-
ior AMA Indoor championships which
are scheduled for February 22 in the
track house. The territory of the Al-
legheny Mountain Association of the
American Athletic Union includes
Pennsylvania west of and including
Blair County, West Virginia, a11d Bel-
mont, Jefferson and Columbiana coun-
ties in Ohio.

Entry blanks, which may be secur-
ed at 35 Vandergrift Building, must be
returned by Monday, January. 20, to
Taylor in this building. Ribbons
will be given to the ﬁrst-three place
winners.

Olson promises that the-track will
be in excellent shape by meet time
on the 25th with the following titles
due to be competed for: 50-yard dash;
300-yard run; 600-yard run; 1,000-yard
run; two-mile run; and 50-yard low
and high hurdle events. ‘

Other events on the program in-
clude: pole vault; running high jump;
running broad jump; 16-pound shot;
running hop, step andjump; and 35-
pound weight throw.-

Oden Presses Bennett

Pete Bennett, sophomore ace, has.

recently been pushed for the ﬁrst

timerin his University career by a

comparative newcomer, Oden, in the
high jump. Bennett and Oden both

are consistently craclkving-the. six-foot‘

mark, which is good‘ for an indoor
ﬁeld.

In drills during.the early part of
this week, Bennett was pushed to six-
feet two or six-feet three inches by
the up-and-coming- Oden. Bennett
rates nationally in spite of.his youth
and lack of varsity. experience. The
Bridgeville boy is accredited with a.
mark of six-feet, seven inches, a
really outstanding jump.

With the return of’ Matisi and
Avizienis Olson’s weight’ events are
bolstered up- considerably. Both’ were
members -of the varsity track squad in
1935.

Red Tost looks bestin the distance
running events. The track and cross-
country star from Plumville, Pa., has
increased the pace right where he
left off after leading the harriers
through a successful season this past
fall.

Harold Connelly,

Charles Groat,

A
T
‘James Van Kennen,

Art Thomas,
Andy Lasky, and Jack McConnell con-
tinue to dominate the quarter-milers
seeking positions on the relay quartet
that will represent Pitt in the Millrose
Invitational Games.

Sol Menaker, Dick Mason, and Ed-
gar Spitz have had no serious chal-
lengers in the sprints, with Menaker
consistently dominating with his ﬁne
pre-season form. Arvil Fleming, dash
and hurdle ace on last year’s team,
has been working out with this trio
in a majority of the workouts. Flem-
ing will be ineligible for competition
during the approaching season due to
graduation.

“It is still not too late to check in
for track equipment and tryouts for
the freshman and varsity teams,”
promises Olson. All new candidates
should report ﬁrst to the Stadium of-
ﬁce for athletic cards and equipment.

Century Club at which the group was
entertained by Miss Thyrsa VV. Amos,
dean of women a11d founder of Cwens.
The national committee entertained
the local executive committee at a
dinner at the Schenley.

Plans were formulated for the next
na.tional convention which will be
held at Miami University in October.
Grace Gerber, president of the chap-
ter at Miami, was present at the meet-
ing and helped with the arrangements.
The last national convention was held
in 1934 at the University.

Suggestions were presented for the
publication of t.he Cwen Courier, of-
ﬁcial publication of the fraternity.

During the business meeting, Miss
Amos was elected national chairman
of the ritual committee and members
of her committee include Maxine Fos-
ter, president of the chapter at Car-
negie Tech, and Mary Jane Beachler,
C38. head of the University chapter.

State, president; Rose Mar_ie Deme-
stichas. C33, vice president; Mrs.
Alice Vance of Lexington, Kentucky,
secretary—treasurer; and Rose Mary
Pierce of Carnegie Tech, national ed-
itor.

 

Eleanor Brown
Awarded Russell
Sage Scholarship

When Eleanor Brown, C36, gradu-
ates this next June, she doesn't ﬁnish
h-er book-toting. Rather she takes the
two-year scholarship, which she just
received from the Russell Sage
Foundation, and travels off to Cath-
olic University at Washington, D. C.
to enter the National Catholic Social
Service School.

Miss Brown is a sociology major
a.nd a psychology minor. In the way
of activities she lists, Cwens, junior
class ﬁnance committee, the Social
Service committee, in connection with
which she did social work, the WSGA
traditions committee, and the presi-
dency of Theta Phi Alpha, Catholic
social fraternity.

She is also a senior mentor and
senior adviser to Cwens.

In answer to the question of what.
she would take up in Washington,
Miss -Brown said: “I don’t know yet.
I'm still stunned by it'all. but I do
intend to go down there this summer
and look over the school. l’ll decide
then.”

Register This Week,
Is Advice To Students

Between Semester Vacation To Extend
From February 1 To 5, Inclusive

 

Every student who is permitted to
register should do so this week, ac-
cording to word received from the
registrar’s office yesterday.

By getting the big rush out of the
way early, the registrar’s oﬁice will
then be completely prepared to take
care of registration of new students
and “blue slippers” on February 4
and 5.

It is probable that no late registra-
tion fee will be charged for failure to
register by the end of this week, but
by giving such a long period for pre-
registration, the registrar’s office an-
ticipates few tardy registrations.

The between-semester vacation will
extend from February 1 to 5, inclu-
sive.

Dr. Blackburn VVilI Speak
To Pre-Legal Fraternity

 

Requirements which must be met
