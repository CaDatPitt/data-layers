Where to study if your
roommcite’s obnoxious

As the semester comes to a close,
last minute crammers have a few safe
havens other than their rooms to work
in during the week of April 20-26. The
University will have certain buildings
open all night for students as they study
for their exams.

The William‘ Pitt Union will keep
the main and lower floors open for stu-
dents to study all night on April 20, 21,
and 22, according to Robert Yeargers,
the Union house manager.

In order to be able to study
Monday or Tuesday nights, students
will have to fill out a registration form

with their names, social security num—_

bers, and the nights they want to study
and turn it in at the information desk.
For students who need to study all
night on other days, the Cathedral of
Learning commons area will be open
all night from April 20 to 26. In order
to enter the building after hours, stu-
dents need to use the Fifth Avenue
doors and have a valid Pitt ID to show

I to the guard on duty. Scaife Hall and

the Second Plate in Forbes Quad will

 

also be open all night for students to
study.

All the other libraries will be open
for their regular hours. If you have not
worked on your papers or programs yet
and need more time in the computer
labs, there is hope yet.

The Cathedral of Learning will
extend its lab closing time until 11:00
p.m. Monday through Thursday, and
Forbes Quad will have its computer
labs open Monday through Thursday
until 2:00 a.m. Most of the labs will be
on their regular schedules, according to

.Hillman Library Lab Consultant

William Brotman. Benedum and
Sutherland halls will keep their labs
operating on the normal schedules.
David Lawrence labs will be open
Monday through Thursday until mid-
night.

If students need a quiet place to
study all night or a lab to do their
papers or programs, they can always
find a place or lab any time of the night
to do their work.

Overall, finals week will provide
students with more time and places to
study for exams, write their papers, and
finish their programs.

_‘_Nicole Cerniglia

You don't know what you may find; why
don't you go for a study shullle ride?

   

It’s finals time again! An occa-
sion for cramming, caffeine, and late-
night study sessions. If you are
pulling any all—nighters and want to
avoid the shady dwellers of Oakland
lurking on the street, take advantage
of the new study shuttle.

“I think it’s a great idea to have a
shuttle like this. Practically every-
body studies late during finals and is
leery to walk home by themselves.
I’d be more likely to hop on the shut-
tle than bother with walking escorts,”
said Sarah Schmidt, a resident of
Holland Hall.

To accommodate the needs of Pitt
students, the Department of Parking
and Transportation is providing the
Safe—Study Shuttle.

“There hasn’t been a great
response to the walking escort ser-
vice, so we decided to try a mode of
transportation,” said Bob Harkins.
director of parking and transporta-
lion.

From April 20 to 23. the shuttle

  

will run from 7:30 p.m. until 3 a.m.

Starting at Hillman, it makes
stops at Mervis Hall, Forbes Quad,
the law school, Schenley Quad,
Lothrop Hall, Scaife Hall, Benedum,
the fraternity complexes, Sutherland
Hall, and finally at Forbes Hall.

“The point of this particular route
is to cover the libraries, computer
labs, and residence halls that are most
utilized,” said Harkins.

For those students traveling off

campus during finals week,tNorth
and South Oakland shuttles, includ-
ing the Campus Express, will run
until 3 a.m. The Van Call will also be
in effect the entire week until 5 a.m.
Pitt students can also ride PAT transit
for free with their I.D. if it’s in the
University zone, or U-zone. The U-
zone covers Oakland, Shadyside, and
Squirrel Hill. ’

The U-zone costs 50 cents after 7
p.m. Monday through Friday and all
day Saturday and Sunday to ride one
zone. A student wishing to go from
Oakland to downtown Pittsburgh
needs only to show his Pitt II). and
pay the fee.

THE PITT NEWS

Recoup a bit of your
hard-earned cash by
reselling your used books

The end is near.

As the semester winds down,
you’re probably wondering what you’re
going to do with that $60 calculus book
now that you’ve declared yourself an
English major. .

Well, you could use it to balance
out that burn leg on your desk, but
chances are that you would want to
make some money by selling it back to
the bookstore.

Selling your books back at the end
of the semester is a good way to get
some money back on books you’ll
never use again, but don’t expect to get
what you paid for them. At best, stu-
dents can get about half of the new
price for their books.

“Before I reach
my quota, I buy books
back at half of their
new price,” says Mike
Chismar of the
Campus Bookstore on
Forbes. “But once I
reach that, prices are
no longer as good.”

Getting the most 
back for your books
depends on two things.
The first is when you
sell your books back. - -- - A
Selling your books as early as possible
and not waiting until the last day that
you’re on campus will help you get a
higher resale value.

The sooner that you sell your‘

books, the better the chances are that
you’ll get a better price for them. It’s
also not good to try to sell back all your
books from the fall and spring semes-
ters at the end of the year. Even worse
is to wait to sell all of your books from
your four years at Pitt at the end of your
college career.

“If you wait until the end of the
year or when you’re finished with col-
lege, chances are pretty good that you
won’t be able to sell any of your
books,” says Chismar.

There is another factor in the equa-
tion of book resale prices —— the profes-
sors.

Buy-back prices depend on the pro-
fessors at the University. The sooner
they turn in their book orders for the
following semesters, the better prices
you as a student are able to get for your
books.

“If I know what’s going to be used
next semester, the prices are better for

 
   

book three days before the ﬁnal is to put

the students,” Chismar said. “But, if I
don’t know what books are going to be
used for next semester, prices will be
lower.”

Certain books have a better chance
of being used from semester to semes-
ter.

For example, it’s a pretty good bet
that you’re going to be able to get rid of
your hardbound psych book, but that
paperback novel for your “Literature of
Lithuanians Locked in Lavatories”
class is a different story.

“We buy back hard— and softback
books as long as they’re being used
next semester,” says Chismar.

Condition isn’t much of a factor. As
long as the cover is on the book, noth-
ing important is blacked out, and the
text is being used in the future, selling
the book should be no
problem as long as you
do it early.

This chance to recoup
some of the cost of your
education comes with
one drawback —- around
the time the buy back
starts, book theft
increases. One of the
most important things
you can do to prevent
becoming a victim of
book theft and having to
repurchase that $50

your name on the cover, keep track of
your books, and be aware of your sur-
roundings.

“Prevention is the key to not losing
your books,” says Chismar. “You
wouldn’t leave $20 lying on a table in
Hillman, walk away for 10 minutes,
and expect it to be there when you get
back, do you? It’s’the same situation
with books when it’s time to sell them
back. It’s quick money.”

If these methods of prevention
don’t work and you still fall prey to
book theft, the first thing you should do
is file a report with the Pitt Police and
give them as much information as pos-
sible. Also, ask them to put the report
out to the bookstores. But, without your
name on the book, there is little that can
be done about it.

“Without a name on the book, it’s
hard to know if it's stolen. There’s real-
ly no other way to tell,” says Chismar.

So remember, if you don’t want to
end up leveling out your desk with last
semester’s archaeology book, keep
track of it throughout the semester and
sell it early for the best price.

Cole tries to make Cafe feel like home
chenley manager is a friendly face in the Marriott crowd

 R. Abdullah

 

Abdou Cole left his home in
Gambia, in Africa, at the age of 18
on a high-school exchange program.
When he finally got to America, one
thought came to him from an

African proverb: “Those whose
bring sunshine to the life of others
cannot keep the sun from shining
upon themselves.”

Cole has since moved to
America and is still reminded of

  

 aw-M-.  - ’ - l‘ 7 * -aw---awn:-v<-woo-¢v}1'ano-aaozvv-v.~vxv~<wv~z~>>+3<-nor

that proverb.

Now, at age 34, Cole manages
the Schenley Cafe in Pitt’s student
union, and tries to use the aphorism
to do more than bring food to the
students. He tries to bring happi-
ness to them, too.

Many Pitt students have given
Marriott Food Services a bad rap. A
few say that it’s because of the
food, others say it’s the lines, and
some say it’s the people. But as
Marriott’s Food Services manager,
Abdou Cole has managed to become

Monday, April 21, 1997

 

not only someone students like, he’s
someone they admire.

Cole said growing up with 24
brothers and sisters helped him
develop a strong sense of communi-
ty. Along with his communal
upbringing, Cole said that he
learned to have a lot of patience and
gained the ability to deal with many
personalities. He says he enjoys
helping people and would rather
have a million people happy than a
million dollars.

Former Pitt student Cheston
Reisler said, “Cole has achieved a
unique relation with so many —
that is often hard to achieve — and
has addressed the needs of the
entire community.”

Due to his outstanding service
Cole has received numerous letters
of appreciation and recognition. At
the University level, Cole was nom-
inated for the chancellor’s award
last year on behalf of some Pitt stu-
dents.

Pitt graduate student Oronde
Sharif agreed. He says that Cole is
much more than just an employee.
In a letter, he stated that “Cole is an
ear, a friend, a resource, and a
brother.”

Business and political science
major Janise Smith says she appre-
ciates Cole’s concern towards stu-
dents in spite of his busy manageri-
al schedule. “Although he is a man-
ager, he’s still concerned and listens
to students problems,” said Smith.

According to Smith, Cole keeps
the communication lines open by
allowing students to voice their
concerns. Cole has no problem dis-
cussing student concerns whether
food related or personal. “Since I’m
going to be a manager [at the news-
paper] next fall, I talked with him
about different management styles
and he gave me some advice,”
Smith said.

According to Pitt Administrator
for Housing Services, Linda Perkins
she said that Cole is highly respect-
ed because he sincerely gets
involved with students.

“One time a woman wanted me
to get the recipe for a dish at the
[Black History Month] dinner. I
asked Abdou for the recipe so I
could give it to her but he took upon
himself to give her the recipe and
told her how she should prepare it,”
said Perkins.

Marriott Food Services Service
Manager, Audrey Costello has been
at Pitt off—and—on as a food caterer
since 1964. According to Costello,

.. Cous, PAGE 5

Monday, April 21, ‘I997

Cole

Cole is in tune with people and is
up-front with everyone. “He’s very
diplomatic in actions and through
his interaction with people,”
Costello said.

According to Cole, he has to
satisfy his “external customers,” or
students, as well as his “internal
customers,” the Marriott employ-
ees. Cole defines good customer
service as knowing his customers.

“Schenley Cafe is like his

home, and when someone leaves I

want them to leave happy,” Cole
said. .
Line Server for Marriott Food
Services, Ida Roebuck said Cole
hasn’t changed in the 13 years she’s
known him. Roebuck is raising her
teenage granddaughter, Brandy, and
said Cole is so interested in getting
to know his employees, he’s even
gotten to know her granddaughter.

She said Cole sends her grand-
daughter notes and
cards throughout
the school year to
encourage her to
do well.

“Cole has a
terrific personality
because he’ll give
me encouragement
when I’m having a
rough time,” said
Roebuck.

Aside from
working for
Marriott, Cole has
dedicated himself
to others less for-
tunate than him-
self. Last year he
volunteered at the
Veterans Affairs
Medical Center in
support of the “National Salute to
Hospitalized Veterans.” According
to Cole, he was compelled to volun-
teer at the VA hospital because
often times the veterans cannot
leave and sometimes receive no vis-
itors.

“I was invited over by [a friend]
to see what she did and when I saw
the Veterans up there I was
touched,” Cole said.

Theresa Cunningham, chief of
the voluntary services, said Cole’s
enthusiasm spread through the stu-
dent body.

“As a result due to [Cole’s]
efforts we had many students visit
and talk with our patients.” she
said. A

The Gambian native has also
provided his services in the commu-
nity by serving  the organizer for
Pittsburgh’s role in the
international AIDS Candlelight
Memorial and Mobilization. The
service is done annually, and its

main purpose is to remember those
that have died from AIDS.
Pittsburgh Coalition Against
Substance Abuse administrator Sam
Thompson says in addition to be-ing
the organizer, last December Cole
took the initiative to recruit 15 Pitt
students for the event. “Over the
past three years, because of
Abdou’s inﬂuence, eight of the 15
students each remained dedicated to
the cause,” said Thompson.
According to Cole, Black
History Month is another time when
he tries to bring students together.
He said programs have been held
annually for the past seven years in
the Schenley cafeteria and have
received local and national atten-
tion. The program has been reported
on in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette,
the Pittsburgh Courier, KDKA-TV,
and it came in third place this year
in the National College University

Food Services
contest. “The
[Black History
Month] program
has been educa-

and an

dents,” said Cole.

The minister
of the Northside
Institutional
Church of God In
Christ, Albert T.
Gans, said going
to Marriott’s
History
Program changed
a teen mother’s
view of life
recently. In a let-
ter to Pitt Vice-
Chancellor Jerry
Cochran, Gans said that, because of
Cole’s efforts “this young lady
wanted to know what she had to do
to go to college.”

Now, in his latest endeavor,
Cole continues to help the commu-
nity by helping to organize the
March of Dimes 10 kilometer run
and walk. The purpose of this
year’s 10—K is to raise money for
research concerning birth defects,
the high infant mortality rate, and
pregnant women with AIDS.

When asked to sum up Cole in a
sentence, Marriott employee, Ida
Roebuck said it was impossible.
“How could you sum it up for a
great person like him?” Her co-
worker Barbara Lynch says Cole is

one of the most caring individuals .

she knows.

Despite Roebuck’s statement,
she tried to sum up Cole the best
she could.

“I would be very proud to be his
mother,” Lynch said.

Many students put a lot of effort into not
doing their work. As the end of the year
approaches and ﬁnal assignments mount,
they’ll ﬁnd they have to try a lot harder to not
get the work done. _

A week ago, tomorrow seemed a long
way off, but the deadline looms: The four— or
six— or eight-page paper must be turned in.
But what if you’ve skipped a lot of classes or
haven’t read your textbook? What if you
don’t even own it yet?! A

Then you’re in trouble, but of course,
it’s not your fault. Life is hard and compli-
cated.

At least tlrat’s what your professor will
say when you get your paper back marked
with a letter from the nether regions of the
alphabet.

But it doesn’t have to be that way.
Writingﬁnalpapersinahurryis askilljust
like, say, painting a fence. In fact, the two
jobs have one common technique — use a
lot of whitewash. ‘

Here are ﬁve easy ways to write a good
paper, at the last minute, with limited knowl-
edge of the subject matter You can’t be com-
pletely ignorant about your topic, but these
methods may help conceal the ﬂaws.

1.) Your point

This sounds easy, but it’s actually the
hardest part of the process. The teacher
wants you to answer a question or defend a
viewpoint in your paper. .

Sometimes teachers give you a speciﬁc
question, while other times you are given a
general topic. Either way, the ﬁrst thing you
must do is think about what the teacher is
asking for. Once you know that, you have a
point to argue.

For example: What caused the fall of the
Roman Empire? or Discuss how the fall of
the Roman Empire might have occurred

Think back on anything you might have
read or heard in class on the topic, and try to
plug in the missing factor that will turn that
question into an answer. That’s your thesis
statement.

One thing to remember is that it doesn’t
have to be spectacular, or speciﬁc. Write
about what you know. Don’t try to guess
“what the teacher wants,” and don’t be afraid
to take a chance.

Keepinmindthatapaperis writtento
‘defend a viewpoint. If there weren’t multiple
viewpoints, there would be no need for argu-
ment.

A thesis statement: The invention of the
aqueduct caused the fall of the Roman
Empire.

Just make sure that you can support
whatever it is you’re arguing. Don’t start
something you can't ﬁnish, and make sure
you have in your ﬁrst paragraph that one
simple sentence explaining the point of your
paper. VVrth that, you have created a direction
for your argument. Now, all you have to do
is follow the path.

2.) For why or wherefore?
Don’ttrytosoundsmart.Keepyour
paper simple. A straightforward, easy-to-fol-

low argument will get you an “A” every
time.

Sometimes, when we’re not sure what
we’re talking about, we try to use big words.

three—page paper by almost half a page. But
don’t do it.

If length is your wony, then manipulate

the type font and margins when you’re ﬁn- ‘

ished. ‘

When using big words to sound intelli-
gent, the opposite often occurs. Last—minute
papers turn into jumbled messes of multiple
instances of “Therefore, as to whether...” and
“Indeed, it is clear the fact that...” We try to
mimic the rhythms of scholarly rhetoric, and

_bookT‘umtothosepages,andseeifthereis

anything you missed (or never bothered to
read) that might support your argument.
. If there’s any chance that your thesis
will work, you should ﬁnd something. When
you do, quote it. That’s the best way to stay
close to what you know, ﬁll up the pages,
and still write a legitimately good paper.
Never plagiarize, but don’t be afraid to
use other people’s arguments to support your
own. Just make sure you credit them.
Remember, you have your point. Just
pore through the book, ﬁnding anything that
remotely relates to it. Make things work.
Again, take chances. Even if a particular

passage only dimly supports your argument,

endupsounding moron- use it. Just make sure
ic. that you explain how the

For example: quote relates to your
Therefore, the aque- point. That’s called

ducts of the Romans

having been made of
lead, the water supply

for the city may well
have been contaminated
and caused many to go

mad from lead poison-

ing.

That sentence ﬂuﬂ°s
up the paper, but is dull and boring. Too
many words. Basic bad writing.

A better example would be: Many
Romans suﬁeredﬁom madness brought on
by lead poisoning because the cityis water
supply was contaminated by lead-lined
aqueducts. , _

The latter sentence is precise.
Remember, good writing is clear writing.
Clear writing should include active verbs
and simple subjects. Don’t think your argu-
ment has to be complicated to be good.

A teacher will read a straightforward
sentence as an indication that you know
what you’re talking about, and, indeed, you
will. The trick is pulling the right infonnation
ﬁorn your mind, and stating it precisely.

Take whatever kernel of information
you got from the class and narrow it down
into simple statements. By doing that,
you’ve taken the reins of your paper, and the
rest is easy.

3.) Lost-minute research

After scraping together an argument and
writing down everything that you know can
support it, you may ﬁnd you’ve only got half
a page of material.

Don’t panic. Take your information and
quickly look it up in the index of your text-

 

“putting it in context”
You have to set the
quote up before slam-
ming it down into your
Paper-

Simply explain
why you think it sup-
ports your thesis,
explain in simple terms
what the quote says, and then quote away!

An example of a quote: According to
the medical dictionary, “small doses of lead
overa long period of time can cause increas-
ingﬁts of psychosis. ”

(Then take a chance and make a con-
nection.)

Water rushing over the lead-lined aque-
ducts carried just enough of the harmﬁtl ele-
ment to slowly drive the entire population of
Rome insane. The textbook states that the
downfall of the empire began long bdore the
aqueduct came into wide use. But the
wealthy began using aqueducts long bdore
they snaked through the city.

(Then, perhaps, another chance and
another quote.)

The wealthy held all the political power
in Rome, and made almost all decisions
aﬁecting the city. As the textbook states, “The
ruling class of the Roman Empire was des-

' ignated by their wealt ”

There, you’ve just made a pretty good
argument. Keep digging through the book,
and don’t be afraid to cheat a little.
Remember, the bigger the quote, the longer
the setup. You’ll ﬁll those pages in no time.

4.) 1-2-3 structure
Now that you’ ve got your thesis, the rest

is easy. The next thing to do is plan to write
your paper in three parts.

The first is your opening paragraph.
That’s where you place your thesis statement
(either as the ﬁrst or last sentence.) The rest
of the paragraph should be setup; explain
your thesis. As a high-school English teacher
once told me, “Say what you are going to
say.” T‘hat’s step one.

Step two is the long part — ”say it.”
You’ve got to support the claims you’ve
made in the opening paragraph. Start each
paragraph in this section with a straightfor-
ward “rninitlresis,” and explain it (see Part
3.)

Here’s a good example of a string of
rninithesis topics: ‘

a.) The rulers of Rome were wealthy. V

b.) The wealthy had aqueducts before
the rest of the city.

c.) The empire began its decline before
aqueducts were widespread.

(L) The fall of Rome is often attributed
to poor leadership.

e.) The leadership was poor because the
rulers were crazy with lead poisoning.

There, you’ve said it Now comes the
third step. “Say that you’ve said it.” A ﬁnal,
wrap-up paragraph should summarize what
you said in the second step. End with your
thesis statement, but start it with a “there-
fore.”

Therefore, the invention of the aqueduct
caused the fall of the Roman Empire.

5.) Don’t screw up

Now that you’ve gone through all four
steps of writing a good last—minute paper,
don’t let stupid mistakes drop your grade.

Proofread. Make sure you cite sources. I

Manipulate the font and margins a little to
meet the page-lengtlr requirement, but make
sure you don’t go too far. Ifyou followed all
these steps, you won’t need to overdo it.

A solid argument is still a solid argu-
ment whether it’s two pages or 10 pages
long. The professor wants to know that you
know what you’re talking about.

Creating four-inch margins and over-
looking obvious spelling mistakes will indi-
cate the paper was a rush job, and may
arouse suspicion. Even if there are only the
tiniest holes in your argument, the teacher
may go back and try to ﬁnd them.

If you give yourself about ﬁve hours to
go through these steps, you should come
away with a pretty decent paper. Keep in
mind that if you had slaved over it for weeks,
you probably would get a better grade.

However, the grade you do receive may
be worth the time you blew olf enjoying the
ﬁrst warm weeks of spring, or the late nights
you spent in the bar instead of in the library.
Obviously, the more time you have, the bet-
ter your grade.

Even if you awake and ﬁnd you have
only one-half hour to start and ﬁnish a paper
or miss the deadline, there is still something
you can do. -

Go back to sleep.

Rome wasn’t built in a day, but it takes
a few hours to explain why it fell.

Stormin’ Norman lectures business students on leadership

More Nuzzo

35:

  

~, -  

Often using military metaphors, Retired
Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, the former
leader of over 800,000 allied troops in the
Gulf War compared leading an organization
to a young officer standing before an empty
tank or aircraft and ordering it to move.

Schwarzkopf attended last
Wednesday’s Pitt Ambassadors‘ Dinner and
discussed the principles that he said make
great leaders.

The key to making these systems effec-
tive is not only the leadership which com-
mands their movements, said Schwarzkopf,
but the people behind that leadership —- the
manufacturers, trainers, operators, and main-
tenance personnel. He said leaders must
never forget that these are people with
“hopes, dreams, and ambitions.”

“Only when all of these people are
involved can any of these high—tech systems
can work,” he said.

Schwarzkopf stated that getting people
to do their job — in any organization——- and
do it the best they can is the real trick of lead-
ership.

And the secret to
Schwarzkopf, is character.

“In a time of crisis, when people are
asked to pick their leader, they pick their
leader on character,” said Schwarzkopf.
“Someone who holds themselves to higher
standards.  They want to feel [their] leader
is someone special.” ‘

He said those who seek leadership
because of position or money will often ﬁnd
themselves shoved out of a “pyramidal work
force” as they approach the top of their orga-
nization’s command; structure.

“The true reward of leadership comes
from leadership itself,” he said.

that, said

Schwarzkopf offered a list of six “fun.-
damental leadership principles” which he
said can be found at the base of all success-
ful leaders and their organizations.

1) For an organization to sugejg. it must
ﬁrst admit that something is wrong and then

strive to change it.
Schwarzkopf recalled how one of his

Army units consistently earned the same
score after a banage of ﬁe1d—operations per-
formance tests each year.

He said that each year they received the
same score: 98.5 percent.

“You don’t change when you’re 98.5
percent good.”

Because of the score, Schwarzkopf said
his unit purchased the same equipment and
trained in the same manner every year. This
simply created a false sense of security and
conﬁdence within the organization, and no
incentive or motivation for it to improve.

As a corollary, Schwarzkopf added that

Norman Schwarzkopf greets Pitt students at Wednesday’s Ambassadors Dinner.

an organization has to create an atmosphere
where criticism is welcomed, listened to and
not punished.

2) Effective leaders must set clear goals.

The most important aspect of goal set-
ting, said Schwarzkopf, is making sure
everyone understands their part in accom~
plishing the organization’s goals.

When commanding the allied coalition
force in the Gulf War, he said success result-
ed because the force “had to win.” Soldiers
knew their goal —”to kick lraq out of
Kuwait”—' and their individual jobs in
accomplishing that goal.

He said this goal—oriented mindset
avoided wasted resources and energy.

“[Goals] relieve your organization of
doing a whole lot of other stuff they don’t
need to be doing,” he said.

3) Those goals must be guided by high stan-
Q
“Nobody goes to work to fail.

7

Everybody  goes to work to succeed. But
in order to succeed, they must know what the
measure of success is.”

Schwarzkopf said organizations that set
their standards at 100 percent may not
always get that, but “will score in the high
90s.” On the other hand, organizations that
set their goals at 70 percent “get just that.”

4) There must be latitude for learning in

accomplishing those goals.
Every leader has achieved his or her

position by making mistakes, said
Schwarzkopf, but has learned from them and
moved past them. Therefore, he said, it only
makes sense to expect the same from those
they are leading.

5) Leaders must reward success within the
 . .

Schwarzkopf described a military unit
which was stuck in the rut of consistent fail-
ure and poor performance. Instead of pun~
ishing them, their commander began to offer‘
smaller challenges to them.

Schwarzkopf said the unit eventually
became more capable and proﬁcient with the
successful completion of each challenge.

Ultimately, he said, the unit became
capable of doing anything it was asked to do.

“Failure is contagious, but success is
infectious,” said Schwarzkopf. '

6) Forget evegﬂing you have just read.

Well, not completely, anyway.
Schwarzkopf said to keep the aforemen-
tioned points in mind as a guideline but
always to remember the two cornerstone
rules of leadership: “When placed in com—
mand take charge,” and “Do what is right.”

Schwarzkopf said great leaders must
always listen to their hearts and do what they
know is right — not what is expected or
what will advance their careers.

This risk, said Schwarzkopf, is the risk
of being a leader.

“They're not just in the park anymore,”
says Kerzrnann. “We're being threatened.”

Kerzmarin, a. self-proclaimed “holistic
nut," says parasites are more prevalent than
the U.S. government would have Americans
believe. He says over 300 typesof parasites
-— including pinworrns, ringworms, tape-

“Hookworms can drink 1 cc [cubic cen-

According to Kerzmann, parasites are

“ ‘‘arthritic-like pains" and ‘‘leukemia-like

One book features sketches of
women wearing strap—on penises while
performing sex acts on one another.

In another book, orgy scenes from the
writings of the Marquis de Sade are
depicted in graphic detail.

And then of course there is
Madomra’s book “SEX”, an erotic free-
for-all in which androgynous looking men
and women simulate everything from a
menage a trois to rape.

This is not merchandise for sale at a
seedy, Triple-X pornography shop on
Liberty Avenue.

These books are all part of the Special
Collections Department at Hillman
Library. ’

“People come in here and are shocked
that we have these things,” said Eleanor
Ferber, who has worked in Special
Collections for 18 years.

“And to tell you the truth, a lot of us
who work here were also shocked at ﬁrst
when we saw some of the sexual stuff, but
now we’re used to it,” she added.

Pitt is rumored to have one of the
largest accumulations of pomography of
any college in the United States, a claim
which the head of Special Collections
laughingly denies. .

“That is just not true,” said Charles
Asten, who has headed the department for
25 years. i

“Because we have some controver-
sial or erotic material, people have a ten-
dancy to come here and ask ‘Where is
your pomography?’ like we have a whole
section just for it labeled ‘pomo’. No
library does.” -

Asten cautioned against labeling
something as. pornography just because it
is sexual in nature.

“You have to remember that what one
person considers pomography, another
person may consider art,” he said.

Some of the sketches included in a
book called “Sexorgies”, for example,
were done by masters like Leonardo di
Vmci and Marc Chagal.

Asten points out that the majority of
material housed in Special Collections is
non—sexual in nature.

“I could go into the stacks and pull out
thousands, actually millions of examples
of literature, history or other scholarly
books.”

“Still,” Asten admitted, “the erotic
material does seem to attract a lot of atten-

tron.

The quiet, paneled roorrr on the third
ﬂoor of Hillman which houses the Special
Collections is an unlikely setting to ﬁnd
sexually explicit material.

serve rare books and manuscripts, the
walls are lined with ‘valuable wood

scent of old paper.

However, texts like a book. signed by
Benjamin Franklin sit side by side on
shelves with more controversial works
like a book of erotic poetry by Anais Nin
or a sex manual by Doctor Ruth.

Asten says the main reason sexually
explicit materials are shelved here is to
protect them. .

“We don’t restrict access to these
materials to keep people ﬁorn viewing it,
we do it to keep it from being stolen or
defaced,” he said.

Like all material in Special
Collections, anyone wishing to view erot-
ica must request it by call number from a
department librarian.

It is not available to check out, and it
cannot leave the Special Collections room.

The lack of privacy may discourage
some people from viewing sexually
explicit material, but according to Ferber,
many more do not seem to mind.

"They used to keep Playboy maga-
zines on the fourth ﬂoor, but students were
cutting out the pictures. Now we keep
them here, so we are always getting stu-
dents asking for 
them,” said Ferber.

“One guy must
have seen every copy
we had. He was a
high school art stu-
dent, and he used to
come in and spend
hours sketching the
centerfolds.”

.It is hard to
imagine Ferber, who
is a wann, motherly
woman, ever being
comfortable looking
up a Playboy maga-
zine for a student, but she says she has seen
a lot in her 18 years with the department.

“Sometimes we’ll even have little 11-
year-old boys who come in and ask for
Playboys. Can you believe it?” she asked.

Asten says another popular attraction
is Madomra’s “SEX” book

“When we ﬁrst got Madonna’s book,
it was constantly busy,” said Asten. “It was
mostly young couples who would sit qui-
etly and look at it together.”

“Ofcourse, we don’t interview people
or ask them why they are looking at mate-
rials. In fact, it would be unethical if we
did,” he added.

There can be moments of embarrass-
ment, though.

Aslsatatatableandleafedthrough
the pages of “SEX,” an elderly man
entered the Special Collections Room.

With a beard as white as snow, he
could have been St. Nick himself.

And when he glanced over at my
table and saw the pictures of a naked
Madonna, tied up and being whipped by
two pierced and tattooed women, his
cheeks turned as red as Santa’s suit.

I must confess I, too, blushed at that

point.

But it highlighted both the diversity of
the material contained in the Special
Collections and the differing reactions to
it.

\V1th over 52,000 physical volumes,
13,000 photographs, 500,000 theatre pro-
grams and various slides, rnicrofrlrns and
recordings, there is ‘something for almost
everyone in Special Collections.

One of the most prized collections is
the Nietz Old Textbook Collection.

Donated to Pitt by Dr. John Nietz in
1957, it now holds nearly 15,000 volumes,
including some primary and secondary
school texts dating back to the 16th
Century.

“Besides Harvard and the Library of
Congress, we’re the only ones collecting
historical educational material,” said Asten
of the Nietz collection.

Theatre buffs can also browse
through the Curtis Theatre Collection.

Dr. and Mrs. Ford Curtis founded the
theatre collection in 1960, and it has since
grown to include more than 500,000 play-
bills as well as other theatre memorabilia

 It is currently
one of the largest col-
lecﬁons of New York
theatre programs out-
side of new York City,
and the material ﬁorn
the Pittsburgh theatre
dates back to 1853.

“We have people that are really into
comics who come in here and say ‘Wow,
I never thought Iwould get to see this,”’
Asten said.

Even as I researched this story, an
elderly woman with a cane hobbled in to
look up the birth and death records of a
friend’s family.

“The man is American, but he lives in
Spain now, and he wants his son to learn
about his American . heritage,” she
explained to a librarian.

Across the room, a young woman
quietly leafed through a stack of tissue-
paper thin sketches.

Today, everything is calm in Special
Collections.

However, that is not always the case.
According to Ferber, some people become
angry or offended when they ﬁnd erotic
material in Special Collections.

“Some people come in here and they
are horriﬁed when they see the sexual
material,” said Ferber. "Ihey ask, ‘Why
do you have this here? How can you work
here?’”

“But we just try to explain to them A

that some people are interested in it.”

they recruited coaches for the major sports:
basketball, track, swimming, and football.

“People forget that we had a great, cham-
pionship swirnrrring team and track 

Posvar not only worked to promote excel-
lence in athletics, but also in academics. In the
early 1970s, he instituted the Chancellor’s
Scholarship program to reward academic
merit.

“It is based on merit, not need, just like
athletics. We also started the Honors College,”
Posvar said.

“We wanted this to be a great academic
institution, and quality is the comerstone.”

9 His leadership style was based on person-
al contact and communication. When dealing
with the student unrest in the late ‘60s, he
stressed communication as vitally important.

“I would talk to them, we would share our
views, and I found in many cases,” we had
common goals.” '

One goal Posvar and the student activists
shared was an increase in minority enrollment
and participation at Pitt. In this, as in every-
thing, Posvar strove for quality.

“In terms of minorities, the key there was
totrecruit for quality, starting with deans and
faculty: minority deans, minority faculty, or
minority adrnir1istrators.”

Communication was a theme during
Posvar’s tenure. In his ﬁrst year, he began to
practice what is called in business manage-
ment circles “walking-around management.”

“In my ﬁrst year, I personally called on
every department chairman.” ‘

While Posvar could not continue to call on
every department chair every year, he prac-
ticed walking-around management to facilitate
communication throughout the University. He
also held special leadership meetings for
administrators on issues such as affumative
action and student concerns.

At the end of his" term, Posvar suffered
from poor communication with the media. He
was portrayed as leaving Pitt with a large
retirement package given by the Board of
Trustees.

"Ihe report of a generous retirement set-
tlement, the terms ‘Walkaway’ or ‘settlement,’
are completely false,” Posvar said.

The beneﬁts of participating in an invest-
ment plan with TIAA-CREF, a mutual ﬁmd
that allows Pitt employees to invest money
over time for their retirement, were what
caused this perception. A person participating
in 'I'IAA-CREF contributes part of their salary,
and Pitt contributes a percentage in addition to
salary contributions. A faculty member con-
tributing 8 percent might have the University
put the equivalent of 12 percent of his salary in
the mutual fund. A person working for 30
years at Pitt could retire at approximately his
ﬁnal salary or more in beneﬁts.

Looking back over his term, Posvar said it
was the best thing that he could have done.

“I had a number of opportunities to move
into government, for example. At every stage,
the University seemed more important. I had
no intention of staying that long,” Posvar said.
“I was having fun. I was enjoying myself. In
the University, you can create, shape the
future.”

Noteworthy news makers
get their just desserts

~ We would like to give our heartfelt appreciation to the people
who made this year so interesting. It is time to thank the movers and
the shakers: the newsmakers. ‘

We would like to thank Dean Koehler and Provost Maher for
providing the controversy of the FAS cuts to give us a hot story that
we broke long before anyone else. It was ever so nice of you guys
to provide us with such a juicy story by taking your hatchet to grad-
uate prograrns and sending the FAS into a terrorized frenzy.

Speaking of hatchets, we would like to thank Roy Kirk for
having the good sense to hang himself in the back of a police van.
What he did was heinous and despicable, and would have cost the

taxpayers a lot of money if he had stuck around and tried his luck
in the judicial system.

Johnny Majors was kind enough to win the homecoming K

game and then step down as the head coach of the football team,
giving the sports section two front-page stories. Way to go, Johnny.
We really appreciate your support.
' ' Thanks to Marriott for giving us plenty of gory food stories. If
it wasn’t the quality of the food you sewed, the current food—ser-
vice bidding gave us plenty of worthy news to print. Combine the
two, and you’ve got one heck of an editorial.

Thanks to the SGB: Their antics were more fun to follow than
the Keystone Cops’. It was really swell of you to allocate your-
selves the money to have a fancy student-recognition dinner. Hope
the food was as tasty as the stories we got out of it.

In a related note, thanks to the GRC for taking an all—expens-
es-paid vacation to Washington, D.C., on our student—activity dol-
lars. S’

We really enjoyed the rocking concerts that the PIC put on. It
was really a blast to cover them, although our ears were still ring-
ing the next day.

The drug-addled brothers at II Ad) deserve a special thanks for
showing us that frats still know how to party. It’s all fun and games

It’s been one heck of a year, and we hope that all of our notable

Third, and last, in a series of
“parting shots.”

Most of us are looking for some
sort of “ultimate truth” —— something
that you can base your life upon. Well,
I don’t mean to sound arrogant, but I
have indeed found that ultimate truth.

It is this: “For God so loved the
world that he gave his only Son, that
whoever believes in him will not per-
ish, but have etemal life.”

You probably recognized that last
statement as John 3:16, the reference
seen prominently at high-proﬁle sports
events. Sometimes I wish it weren’t
because it might cheapen the message.

The fact is, you won’t ﬁnd ulti-
mate truth in a book, an empty philos-
ophy, or a bottle. You can’t buy it in a
store, and you can’t earn enough to buy
it if you could.

No, ultimate truth is found only in
a person.

And his name is Jesus Christ.

Here’s the scoop: Remember
back in Genesis, when Adam and Eve
ate some fruit (it does not say apple)
that God had told them not to? Well,
from that point on, the human race
became separated from God and rebel-
lious toward Him. But even then, God
had a plan that would someday recon-
cile people to Himself.

At different times, He would
reveal himself to certain historical ﬁg-
ures: Noah, who built the ark;
Abraham, to whom He promised a
great nation; Moses, who would lead
that nation, called Israel, out of Egypt;
King David; and scores of prophets too
numerous to name. All through that
time, God made it clear that His
Anointed was coming.

And around 4 B.C., in a little town

ing it.

called Bethlehem, he came — origi-
nally known as Y’shua Harnashiach.
(In fact, Jesus Christ is the Greek ren-
dition.)

Before I go any farther, let me
give you a little background. Our
Jewish friends know that, in the time of
Moses, God instituted a complicated
sacriﬁcial system of atonement for

which sin was forgiven. However, God,

was in practice unapproachable, so
holy that His name wouldn’t even be
pronounced (the best English render-
ing is Yahweh).

But people, especially Israel, still
went their own way. There’s a lot of
history there, but I’ll skip it for our pur-
poses.

Anyway, we often see Christ
(who, I must add, was both God and
human) as a teacher, a preacher, a com-
forter of the aﬁlicted, and an afﬂicter of
the comfortable. He preached quite a
bit about the Kingdom of God, and that
he would come someday to bring jus-
tice and righteousness to this rotten
world. Trouble was, what was left of
Israel at that time hoped he would
overthrow Rome, which ruled
Palestine at the time, and restore
Israel’s fomrer splendor.

Instead, rejected by the Jews and
railroaded by the Romans, he ended up
on the cross of a common criminal —
which was God’s plan ‘all along. Jesus
also came for that purpose, that through
that last sacrifice (indeed, at the
moment he died, the veil of the Holy of
Holies ripped apart), God and the sin-
ful human race could be reconciled.

And then‘ when Christ arose -
controversial even today —- and
appeared to his closest disciples over
the next few months; they could not
keep silent.

That, in a nutshell, is the Christian
faith.

The campus sage finds the ultimate truth

You may ask, “What about other
religions? Isn’t there any other way to
God?” No. You see, almost all other
religions teach that if you’re good
enough and follow the rules, God may
accept you.

But with Christ, you’ve already
lost before you’ve even started.
Because of your sinful nature, you
can’t keep God’s law. (Believe me, I
tried!) However, when you come to
Christ, you take his righteousness so
that you escape the wrath of etemal
punishment.

But there’s more to being a
Christian than going to heaven. You
see, God now has a claim on the rest of
your life and demands a change of
heart and mind (called “repentance”).
A few examples: If you’re single and
sexually active, that must stop.
Drunkenness? Forget it. Bitter feelings
about others? Got to go. Obsessed with
making money? Not for long. In fact,
when Jesus said to Nicodemus that
“you must be bom again,” he really
meant that he had to change his entire
way of life in order to.connect with
God — in this life and the next.

Fortunately, God left us with three
things in order to sustain us in our rela-
tionship with Him: first, the Bible, His
written Word. Second, the Holy Spirit,
by which we can discem truth ﬁom
error. Third, the assembly of fellow
believers who can nurture and admon-
ish us in the faith. And we do have to
tell others about Christ That’s just what
I’m doing here.

I could say more, but I’m out of
space. Ifyou forget everything else I’ve
written over the last three and a half
years, remember this: .

Jesus Christ is the Truth. (And for
good measure, the Way and the Life.)

It’s not necessarily the news from‘ our news editor

When you’re a reporter, you get to talk
to people and witness events that most folks
only read about. It’s an exciting job to say
the least, and it provides you with an inter-
esting perspective on the world you live in.

But in the course of reporting stories,
there is a lot of background information that
never gets passed along to the reader.
Sometimes it’s because that info is too
graphic or obscene, and the writer must
censor himself. For instance, the reader
doesn’t need a graphic description of a dis-
membered body to know that a crime
occurred.

There’s been a lot of news this year,
and I was lucky enough to run the section
that brought it to you. But there were cer-
tain curious stories that didn’t make it into
the paper for one reason or another. In no
particular order, I’d like to take this chance
to give you some of the more interesting
ones.

1. Allocations, shmallocations!

There’s been a lot of talk about the
SGB allocating itself student money. We at
The Pitt News have been pretty hard on
them, but there’s more to the story than we
printed. The SGB has been looting even
more money from the student activities

account all year for their own personal ben-
eﬁt. . ,

President Justin DalMolin confessed
the operation to me a few nights ago in

front of the student union. “Pornography

and Jolt Cola,” he confessed with a burp —
“$2.3 million down the drain.”

2. Back to the Future

. On March 16, a young teaching fellow
in Pitt’s physics department stumbled onto
what could be the greatest discovery in the
history of mankind.

Leaning over an electron microscope,
Andrea Nacinzerb tried to explain to me
how the subatomic particles she’s been
researching can actually move backward in
time.

“At certain velocities, a combination of
tungsten and hydrogen atoms can produce
a static electricity that excites certain light
waves, and we believe it forces the particles
backward in time much the way a superno-
va creates wormholes in space,” she said.

At that time, Nacinzerb was working
on a way to harness the energy and send a
beacon backward in time. “We have a
receptor operating now,” she said. “And
when we send this device back, the sonar

.. should trigger it so we can ﬁnd out how far V

back in time it goes.”
During the interview, Nacinzerb
looked up to see an exact replica of herself

enter the office.

“Wait! I’m tellingyou, scrap the pro-
ject!” the breathless clone said.

“But why?” Nacinzerb asked herself.
“Are you from the future?”

“Yes! Your project will be a success,
but time travel will become commonplace.
Anyone can go back in time and assassinate
rulers, change the course of history, and win
millions by betting on major sporting
events!”

The present—tense Nacinzerb leapt
from her chair. “My God, I’ve got to stop
this!” With that, she rushed over to her
equipment, and began smashing the
machinery to bits. Sparks ﬂew,a and ﬂames
burst from the whining centrifuge.
Nacinzerb threw her notes into the blaze
and rushed out of the office, vowing never
to return to science.

When the ﬂames died, and the smoke
cleared, I found myself alone with the
futuristic Nacinzerb. .

“Hey, you’re still here,” I said. “Isn’t
that a paradox?”

Nacinzerb gripped her neck and pulled
the latex mask from her face. “No, it’s just
me, FAS Dean Peter Koehler,” he said
adjusting his dress and glasses. “After all
Andrea’s hard work, I just didn’t have the
heart to tell her we were cutting the pro-
gram.”

3. The Second Coming of Jesus Christ

Whether it really was the second com-
ing depends on whether you’re a Jew or a
Gentile, but no matter how you slice it, this
was one of the more interesting stories that
didn’t make it into The Pitt News.

_ We were short of space in the section
that night and had to pull the story to ﬁt in
another one about the SGB. In retrospect, I
think this was a mistake.

The next day was a Thursday, and the
story got bumped again for the police blot-
ter. By the next Monday, the story just was-
n’t newsworthy anymore, and alot of Pitt
students never heard about it.

The whole thing went down around 3
o’clock in the afternoon. There was a rum-
ble, the ground split, water turned to fire,
and frogs fell from the sky over Towers, as
The Savior rode a purple cloud onto the
Cathedral Lawn to the tune of “Sergeant
Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band.”

“I’ve come to show you the portal

leading directly to the Kingdom of A

Heaven,” the Lord said. “It’s right here in
Oakland. Just follow Me.” But as the Lord
stepped out onto Bigelow Boulevard, he
was promptly run over by a PAT bus.

“Told you they should have closed the
street,” said Bigelow Task Force Director
Jen Molluso.

Stressed student ramblingly rants about everything‘

 

It’s the end of the semester,
and I have a lot of work to do,
with almost no time to do it.
Maybe it’s the stress, maybe it’s
the lack of sleep, maybe I’m just
burned out, but whatever it is,
I’m feeling just a bit bitter and
surly. I try not to let this out most
of the time, and I really don’t
like to let my mood become
known if it might taint that of my
friends, but I’m afraid that if I
hold it in forever, if I let myself
fester, fester, fester, rot, rot, rot,
then I’ll go nuts. So, for the sake
of my own sanity, I hope you’ll
all forgive me if I rant a bit about
nothing in particular. It will
make me feel much better. And

who knows — maybe you’ll
agree with. me.
Why.is it that most of us still

have to go to two different places
to register for classes, and three
or more if we want honors class-
es or restricted classes? What the
hell is a restricted class, anyway?
Do you mean that I might not be
allowed to take that class? I’m
paying just as much as any other
Pa. resident to take classes at this

school, this public institution.
Does someone mean to say that
they might tell me no, I can’t
take the same class as this other
jamoche, when the class isn’t
even full already?

How many goddamn anti-
abortion ﬂyers am I gonna be

handed and have to throw away,

before somebody realizes that I
just don’t care and can’t do any-
thing to change things anyway?
How long will it be before
the SGB forgets about the lost
cause of Bigelow Boulevard and
looks right next door to keep the
William Pitt Union open all
night long? I’d much rather play

3-D Frogger dodging the cars on.

Bigelow if I could shoot pool at
any hour of the night with some
friends. We could use a bowling
alley, too. Not enough space in
the union for bowling lanes, you
say? Get rid of Schenley Cafe;
everybody seems to hate it any-
way. Or how about virtual-reali-
ty bowling? And instead of
bowling balls and bowling pins,
we could roll virtual atom
bombs at virtual CMU_ indie
rockers.

Why the hell aren’t there
concerts here at Pitt? Bob Dylan

is playing at IUP next‘ week. IUP,
for Pete’s sake! (Who is Pete,
anyway? Would somebody
please explain that one to me?)

What the hell are these signs
I’ve seen that say, “Oppose
homophobia, don’t wear jeans
on Thursday?” Not only do I
think that we shouldn’t be intol-
erant of others because of their
sexual preference, but I don’t
think we should be intolerant of
people because of their fears
either. If you think we should be
accepting of all people, then why
would you be unaccepting of
people who don’t feel the same
way? And it’s a ‘bit unfair to
those of us who don’t own any
pants other than jeans, too. What
are we supposed to do? This is
hypocrisy.

Another type of hypocrisy:
people who say they’re Christian
and then boycott Tom Cruise
movies because he’s a
Scientologist. Of all the people
who are supposed to be accept-
ing of others, Christians should
top the list, not to mention that
Tom Cruise has got to be the
least despicable celebrity I have
ever heard of. Intolerance of
other religions or philosophies is

the worst kind of ignorance; of
all things in a person’s life, reli-
gion is one of the most personal,
and often the most important
thing he has to hold onto.

Why does MTV now have
more half-hour shows each day
than music videos? They air that
damned “Singled Out” show 20
times a day! What the hell do I
care if Karen likes guys with hair
on their asses more than guys
without it? Where’s the music in
Music Television now? That sta-
tion was far better before
“Remote Control” ever aired and
started the downhill run toward
becoming Blind-Date
Television. ‘

I’m about fed up with peo-
ple who are too pretentious to go
for a drink at a coffee shop
because they think only preten-
tious people go to coffee shops. I
hate pretentious and judgmental
people, but I’m not going to let
them keep me out of Kiva Han,
because they have really good
Earl Grey tea, even if it does cost
way too much. And when did
that happen? When did tea and
coffee go from 65 cents to $4?

I’m sick of classes where
one’s grade is based on atten-

dance or busywork. This is sup-
posed to be higher education, not
kindergarten. We should be
judged on what we learn, and not
on how much time we spend on
the subject. If I can learn in 20
minutes by reading on my own
what the teacher spent three
weeks lecturing on because he’s
an inarticulate speaker who likes
to tell personal stories of nore1e-
Vance to me whatsoever, I don’t
think I should be penalized. If
the lectures are good and infor-
mative, I’ll probably go, though
sometimes I’m just too busy and
can’t be in three places at once.
If a teacher is too lazy to grade
actual work and just wants to
count the number of times I was-
n’t in class, he should be fired for
not doing his job of trying to
teach and to assess my learning.

Well, I’m tired and need
some sleep. But I do feel a bit
better now. I hope I didn’t
depress everybody. Thanks for
listening, and have a good sum-
mer, folks.

The Opinions Goddess shows her appreciation

Well, folks, I guess this is it. Ihave been
the Opinions Goddess for eight glorious
months, and it is time for me to stepdown
ﬁem my post and pass the mantle to my
more—than-capable successor.

I’ve thought about what I should do as
my coup de grace, and the only thing I have
the desire to do is to thank all of those people
who have made this year the long, strange trip
it has been. I won’t do the usual just-list—the—
names-and-bore-you-all-to-tears bit because
the things these people have done for me per-
sonally need to be commended and «put on the
record To do anything less would be cheap of
me and not do them justice.

First of all, I would like to thank Ben
Jackson. If it weren’t for him, I neither would
have gotten to be the O.G., nor have become
accustomed to those little glass slippers that I
love so much but that still make my feet hurt.

Perhaps I am just an ugly stepsister, but occa-

sionally, I get to be Cinderella It’s been a fan-
tastic ride, and I never would have gotten to
know all of these people who I now hold near
and dear if it weren’t for you. Thanks, Benny-
boy, for being a true friend

Kris Kissel is going to take over my cubi-
cle and the responsibilities of being an
Opinions Icon. He’s not me, but that’s proba-
bly a good thing. I know he’ll take the opin-
ions section to new, uncharted heights and
probably kick a lot of ass in the process. Also,
since he's the one who taught me how to kill
with my bare hands, I know that nothing will
come his way that he can’t handle. Good luck,
Mr. Kristian, even though you won’t need it.

The Sports Guys deﬁnitely need to be‘

sure in pissing me off, but you didn’t succeed
in getting me to hit you. You might be able to

it. Grzyboski, I must say that you have the
uncanny and indispensable talent of being
able to see the bright side of things. Hold onto
it. It will take you far. And Anne Estonilo,
keep shaking that booty. ‘

There is one per-

while, well, I’d have to ﬁll all of the space
myself, and people might get tired of that. I
think that we have seen the widest assortment
of characters pass through the opinions sec-
tion this year, and I enjoyed reading all of your
work. Thanks for all the help.

Now. for those individuals who are gen-
uinely opinions gurus in their own right.

Rick Nowlin, with his 17 years here at
Pitt, has through perseverance and the wis-
dom one gains over time rightfully eamed the
title of “Campus Sage.” Your unique perspec-
tive and versatile range added depth to the
section. I wish you great success. Your leav-
ing The Pitt News is deﬁnitely an end of an
era.

I would like to thank Mike Berquist for
being the most on—the—ball columnist of the
year. Your two or more colurrms a week
allowed me to make this year the biggest and
best opinions section this campus has ever
been fortunate enough to have the opportuni-
ty to read.

I would like to congratulate the enigmat-
ic p.r. taylor on being the MVP of opinions.
Your British charm, biting wit, and unfailing
ability to call it like you see it has gained you
a loyal following of readers and notoriety

‘ throughout the campus. You have not only

been a great columnist‘, but a faithful friend as
well. Our joint ventures have been inspira-
tional to our writing and our rather unconven-
tional philosophies. Thanks for always being
there for me even though you are as sancti-
monious as your sunﬂowers are tall. You are
as outrageous in person as you are in print. I
don’t think I could pay you a higher compli-
ment than that.

Well, folks, I think that just about covers
it. It’s a hell of a life, but I’ll miss it anyway.
Anyone who didn’t like The Pitt News and
especially the opinions section this year can
bugger off, to borrow a phrase from ms. tay-
lor. Everyone up here worked extremely hard

little eyes on this campus have ever seen
They are exceptional individuals who I am
extremely grateful to have gotten the chance
to have worked with. It’s been real, but I am

Best wishes for departing senior stars

 
    

, It seems hke the end of the year always
causes the same reaction. Freshman are
exhausted, ready to go home and pick up
where they left off eight short months ago.
Little do they know that it’s not the same

that it never will be again.

Sophomores have a little bit more lee-
way. Some of these budding adults stick
around in their Oakland apartments that
mommy and daddy spent weeks refurbish-
ing only to see the Beast come in and
destroy.

Other second—year vets will trek back
home yet again for an even tougher sum-
mer than the last.

Now, juniors are the luckiest. They are

number of reasons. One, changing that
major a third time pretty much equals suin-
mer courses. And won’t they be glad the
bill goes home.

Others want to let loose before they are
forced into becoming clean-cut, responsi-
ble members of the working community
once they become seniors. Furmy how they
know about the local bar’s special seven
days a week, though.

There are other junior genres, but the

after your ﬁrst year of higher education and almost certain to stay in the ‘Burgh for a

Micl-week series bombs

Baseball loses to Kent, WVU in 2-game homestancl

“Eric Knopsnyder

The Pitt baseball team continued

to hit well and pitch poorly in losses
last week to West Virginia and Kent
State.

Kent pounded out 17 hits and got
some help from the Pitt fielders,
who committed six errors in
Thursday’s 9-7 loss.

Pitt scored three runs in the bot-
tom of the ninth, when Steve
Dickinson hit his team—leading 10th
home run of the season. But it was
too little, too late as the Panthers
dropped their fourth straight.

Kent led 7-4 going in to the top
of the ninth and picked up what
turned out to be two very important
insurance runs on an error by third
baseman Scott Lobaugh.

Left—hander Kevin Lazeski (4-6)
went eight innings, giving up six
earned runs and 15 hits to take the
loss.

Pitt had trailed 2-0 in the first,
but tied the score when Rob Gavey
hit a one—out single to score Sam
Crowley and Lobaugh.

Kent scored three more in the
second inning and led the rest of the
way. Pitt did manage to get within a
run -in the sixth, when Chris

 
 

Delsignore and Chad Meade scored
on an error by Kent’s Sam Crea.

Pitt’s record is now 16-19, while
the Golden Flashes’ is 13-19.

West Virginia outslugged Pitt
14-11 in a four-hour, 10-minute, 11-
inning marathon, on Wednesday.

Rob Garvey went 4-5, with four
runs scored and an RBI. Garvey tal-
lied a single, two doubles, and a
triple, plus a base on balls. Steve
Dickinson went 2-5 with a two—run
home run and four RBIs.

WVU’s Jason Frushour led off
the 11th with a home run, and West
Virginia added two more insurance
runs off reliever Rob Schaffer (1-2).

The Panthers could not hit WVU
ace Chris Enochs (7-1) and went

quietly in the bottom half of the '

11th. The hard-throwing Enochs
struck out four of the nine batters he
faced to gain the win.

West Virginia got to'Pitt starter
Eric Rosing early as Josh
Williamson led off the game with a
double and later scored on a double
play.

The Panthers rallied in the sec-
ond, when Garvey led off with a
triple and scored after Dickinson
walked and Mike Isaac singled.
Chris Delsignore then hit a two-out

The Pitt News: What was your
impression of the Pitt basketball
team’s finish?

Mike Kovak: I was really
impressed with Vonteego
Cummings, especially in the Big
East tournament in the game against

UConn. You knew he was going to_

take over the game for Pitt. He was
going to dribble the ball down the
court and put the shot in. They’ve
needed a guy like that for God
knows how long. '

TPN: What’s going to happen to
Mark Blount in the world of pro bas-
ketball?

MK: That was honestly the dumbest
decision I think I’ve ever heard of.
He was just
starting to
d e v e 1 o p
into ‘ a
dependable
c o l 1 e g e
player. He
wasn’t a
star. If he’d
s t a y e d
a n o t h e r
year or two,
he’d have been an NBA number one
pick. .
Christ, he’s only 21 years old.

I do think he’d make a great cen-
ter in the WNBA. I don’t know if he
can take on Lisa Leslie, but I think
he would do good against a Rebecca
Lobo or somebody.

 

TPN: What about the future of the
program?

MK: Well, I was really optimistic
until I heard about Blount. Andre
Howard, and Issac Hawkins.

But the recruiting class is sup-
posed to be pretty good, but every-
body’s academically ineligible or
blew their knees out or something.

THE PITT NEWS

It’s going to be tough, but they
should be all right. No other team in
the Big East is going to be that much
stronger.

They’1l all be okay. Except for
Vonteego — he’s going to be the
man.
And thank God Andre Howard is
transferring. That bum hasn’t done a
damn thing. St. Joe’s is more than
welcome to him.

And Hawkins, if he wants to
leave, let him. He’s a whiner. We
don’t need any whiners up here.

'We’re a class program. We don’t

have room for him.

Yeah, we should be okay. And if
Chris Gardella can step in and bring
some quality minutes off the bench.

TPN: What was your reaction to the
controversy between Kevin Willard,
his dad, and The Pitt News sports
section?

MK: That was pretty humorous. I
was kinda happy tosee it. It was
good to see some controversy up
there. It was good to get the juices
ﬂowing.

I didn’t actually read the article.
I heard it was pretty mean.

Columnists are allowed to voice
their opinion.

[Matt] Grove had final say in
what went into .  --
the sports sec-
tion. He was
the sports edi-
tor.

It wasn’t
like Willard’s
production was
anything. You
saw how he ran
the offense. It wasn’t that spectacu-
lar.

&

 

TPN: Changing subjects, how long
will it take for Walt Harris to turn
the football program around?

 

   

e Once and Future

Mike Kovak, ex-expert ancl reigning South
Oakland sports hero, holds court with Kevin
Lilley in one final appearance for The Pitt News.

MK: I’m pretty optimistic about
football. From the stuff I’ve read, it
sounds like Harris is pretty commit-
ted. They’re going to run a kind of
West Coast-type offense with short
passes and stuff. It should be pretty
effective.

They’ve got
one of the best
backfields in
the country
with [Dwayne]
S h u 1 t e r s ,
[Billy] West,
[ C u r t i s ]
Anderson, and
[Hank] Poteat.
Wide receiver
is going to be
the position
that they’re going to have the most
problems at. They have a lot of
unproven guys, except for Jake
Hoffart. He pretty much proved
himself last year.

Hopefully, in two or three years,
we see a bowl game. Hopefully,
Harris will have the patience and get
the recruits in here.

TPN: What about this season, and
the Penn State game?

MK: They’re going to get killed [at
PSU]. Penn State’s in top three next
year, probably.

If Pitt can give them a good
game and keep it within 17 points,
that would be a really good barome-
ter for future games down the road.
If it's close, that would be nice.

Penn State’s so much better than
us, its pretty sad. But Pitt’s trying. A
competitive loss would be nice after
all of these blowouts. It would be
nice to give a ranked team a game.

Either Pitt would blow Kent out
of the water, or Pitt would get blown
out of the water. One or the other.
That’s how it usually works. It’s a
shame.

’ Monday, April 21, ‘I997

TPN: In your four—plus years at Pitt,
what was your fondest sports memo-
ry?

MK: I do have one. One singular
moment. It happened during my
freshman year.

Me and a couple buddies got
pretty lit up and went to the Seton
Hall game. They were ranked sev-
enth in the country and they had
Hurley and a couple of good players.

Two seconds left, and Garrick
Thomas, who was a freshman at the
time, was 25 feet from the hoop.

He threw up the shot. We all
kind of cringed. He was leaning to
his left, and we didn’t think it had a
chance. .

The shot went in, and we rushed
the court. I got my face in front of a
camera. That was easily my fondest
Pitt memory. That’s pretty sad, I
guess.

TPN: Now that your career here is
finished, what do you think you’ll
miss most about the University?

MK: I liked Oakland. I’m going to
be here this summer becausel don’t
want to find anything to do for a
while.

I don’t know what I’m going to
miss most. I’ll miss all the parties
and getting messed up any way I
could.

Pretty much thwarting responsi-
bility as long as possible. That’s
what I’ll miss when I’m having to
go to work,
get a hair-
cut, and that
stuff.

And, of
course, all
the fan mail
I got during
my stint at
The Pitt
News sports
section.

list is too long to elaborate on. They have —
at least they hope so — only one year left.

That leaves us with the senior class.
Granted, there are the pharmacists, the dou-
ble majors, and those of us who just don’t
have the motivation to pick up and leave yet.
However, most of the seniors will be leaving
in less than twoaweeks, and this makes me
think about what people do with their time at
Pitt.

The Annual Student Athlete Senior
Banquet last Tuesday made me think about
that even more.

I watched as the senior members of
every sport were recognized for their contri-
butions at Pitt in the realm of athletics and
received watches

A watch is nice — heck, the Athletic
Department didn’t have to give them any-
thing —— but I really wonder what was going
through their heads.

Unless you are a student athlete, and I
am not, it is impossible to understand the
responsibilities that they shoulder.

I listened as an amazing number of stu-
dents were honored for attaining 4.0 grade-
point averages.

Imagine working a full—time job ——
which is what an athlete does for his/her
sport — without getting paid, and then hav-
ing to take a demanding course load at the
same time. Throw in team meetings, friends,-
and other extracunicular activities, and that
gives these young adults little or no time to
themselves. .

Imagine doing all of this under a micro
scope known as the media. ‘

'I'HE PI'l"l' NEWS

The life of a big-time college athlete
seems like it would be all roses, but what
about the kids who aren’t big time?

What about the kids who don’t have the
full scholarships or any scholarship at all?

What is their motivation? What makes
then work their ﬁngers and minds to the
bone for hours on end just to wake up and do
it again the very next day?

As I watched parents and coaches beam
with pride as their players, sons, and daugh-
ters accepted their awards Tuesday, I began
to understand a little bit more.

It’s not about national TV to every kid. i

It’s not about Sports’ Illustrated, USA
Today, or the Pittsburgh Post—Gazette. And
it’s certainly not about The Pitt News.

These student athletes have pride.

These people do it for themselves, their

 

parents, and for the people who are irnpor—
tant to them. People like their coaches and
friends.

They don’t do it for anyone else, and
they shouldn’t.

Unfortunately, not every student gets
the most out of their education, but my hat
goes off to those who have left their mark at
Pitt.

I commend those athletes who walked

' up to the podium in the William Pitt Union

Assembly Room and shook hands with
Steve Pederson and their respective coach-
es.

Eventually their names will be forgot-
ten, and new names and faces will replace
them. I’ve seen many of these people com-
pete, and at times their performance hasn’t
been the best, but I know that this wasn’t out

 

 FROM PAGE 13

of laziness or lack of heart.

Hopefully, everyone who leaves Pitt
next week will come back someday, but I
know that isn’t the case.

These people leave behind them some- _

thing that nobody can take away from them.
They have set records that may be broken
one day. They have heard the cheers, and
many have left as champions.

As I leave Pitt for the fourth time, only
to come back very soon, I will be thinking
about those people -— both athletes and non-
athletes —— who are ﬁnished with their colle-
giate careers.

I hope that you look back and View your
time at Pitt as the best time of your lives,
because so many of you have made it the
best time for me and many, many others.

Good luck.

RBI single to score Dickinson.

Dickinson gave Pitt a 4-1 lead in
the third with his ninth home run of
the year. —

The Mountaineers exploded for
five runs with two out in the sixth.
Rosing walked the leadoff hitter and
gave up a single to catcher Jason

_ Frushour before Joe McNamee hit a

three—run home run to close the gap
to 5-4. Abe Barker, the next
Mountaineer batter, homered to tie
the game at five. Rosing then gave
up a single to designated hitter Troy
Englehart. Englehart scored on one
of reliever Jeff Sofran’s three wild
pitches to give West Virginia a 6-5
lead. Jory Coughenour came in to
finally get the third out of the
inning.

West Virginia extended its lead
to 7-5 in the top of the seventh on an
RBI single by Frushour.

Dickinson tied the score at seven
with two-run single that scored Sam
Crowley and Garvey.

 FROM PAGE 13 

The Panthers added three more
runs in the eighth, on RBI singles by
Crowley and Garvey and a wild
pitch, giving Pitt a 10-7 lead going
into the ninth.

The Pitt bullpen could not hold
the lead, however. The trouble start-
ed when WVU’s Matt Keenan
reached first after swinging and
missing a third strike in the dirt.
Williamson followed with his sec-
ond hit of the game, and Kirk Taylor
tied the game at 10 with a three—run
home run. Frushour followed with a
double and later scored on a sacri-
fice ﬂy by Englehart.

The Panthers fought back in the
bottom of the ninth with a run on a
hit batsmen, a walk, and a one-out
single by Lou Melucci.

The loss dropped the Panthers to
6-11 in the Big East, while West
Virginia improved to 13-3 in the
conference.

scored to cut the margin to one.

“That goal got us real excited, but
there was only about one minute left,
and we were still losing 8-7,” Capili
explained. “Then with only about 40
seconds left, Jodi [Bowman] scored a
real nice goal to tie it up and send it
into overtime.”

The Panthers’ good fortune ran
out as the Bobcats scored one minute
into the overtime period, giving them
the victory.

“I told our players that we had
nothing to be ashamed of. We gave it
our all and played great,” Capili
added.

Pitt rebounded from the loss with
an impressive 11-5 win over Kent
State.

“I think it shows a lot about the
character of this team,” Bowman
said. “We used the loss to Ohio U. as
motivation in the Kent State game.
We showed a lot of team unity.”

Pitt rounded up their marathon
day with a tough 8-5 loss to Buffalo
University.

“I think we were just really worn
out by the Buffalo game,” Sinor
explained. “The earlier games, espe-
cially the Ohio U. game, took a lot
out of us.”

The 2-2 performance at Sunday’s
tournament upped Pitt’s season

 

record to 5-2 and qualified them for
post-season" play. However, the
Panthers will not participate in the
playoffs because too many team
members had prior commitments.

“We got together and decided as a
team that if we couldn’t go as a team,
then we wouldn’t go,” Bowman, a
team captain, explained. “We stuck
together all year, and it wouldn’t be
the same if the team that went to
playoffs wasn’t the team that got us
there.”

Many lacrosse players hope that
their success in Sunday’s tournament
will give them a little momentum in
their quest to have their sport pro-
moted to varsity status.

“Personally, I think it would ben-
efit the University a lot to make us
varsity,” Capili said. “Most of the
other schools around here now have
varsity programs.

“A lot of girls from eastern
Pennsylvania come here to play any-
way, but Pitt’s losing out to some of
the schools that offer scholarships. If
Pitt were to offer scholarships, it
would help them even more to bring
some of the girls here.

“We have a lot of talent on our
team already. If we were to go varsi-
ty, I guarantee we would be success-
ful.”

Being Called Baby

Old men come in looking tired of man things,

call me ”baby” the same way they cal their daughters,
and I'm not offended,

because they whisper it like a lullab ,

like they are resting themselves on the word, "baby,"

it comes out as regular as their breath

and almost as soft. They play their numbers,

and the numbers I punch into the lottery machine could be

They tell me when they pla their own birthda

there's got to be a reason for them to play their own days,
and the pass fives, tens, twenties, or only two quarters
across the counter to me and say, ”that’s all, bab ”
and the ”bab ’ comes out softly on the last breath,
as they lean t eir heavily callused hands on the counter,
rest the weight of their bodies on their hands,

and wait for me to pass them their tickets,

and they don't smile, even when I do,

with an emphasis on ”care,” or ”good,”

Get on board the electronic music bandwagon

(before the next next big thing comes along and swallows it up)

Hold the bandwagon, mama, I’m a—jumpin’
on!

Anyone who has picked up a periodi-
cal lately has seen that the music industry is
attempting to unearth the “next big thing.”
It is nearly impossible to look through an
industry magazine, fan magazine, or web
music pages without reading about the
death of popular contemporary music and
the birth of electronic music as the indus-
try’s savior.

Six years ago, when Nirvana’s
Nevermind went on record store shelves,
the Seattle trio was heralded as purveyors
of the “next big thing,” no doubt to the sur-
prise of the band’s many diehard fans who
had been following them for years. A previ-
ously—underground sensation had bubbled
to the front of American popular culture.
Rather than wasting time and effort to
develop individual artists with independent
views, record—company executives took the
famous shortcut that had been so prevalent
in the past and began scouring the country
in search of the next Nirvana.

Electronic music has been called the
“next big thing.” Record companies have
issued long reports and memos stating their
mission: to jump on that bandwagon.
According to A&R people across the coun-

_ about “electronica” center

try, alternative rock is boring and over, and
this electronic thing is what they are look-
ing for.

What the industry has managed to get
a hold of is a very minute piece of the scene
moved by the need to sell as many units to
as many people with common pedestrian
tastes. The authentic DJ culture of vinyl
records and home recorded mix tapes is far
from what is happening, as is the genuine
underground music being produced on
small labels across the globe. Journalists
and television—prograrn directors
have not discovered any-
thing. They merely latch on
to what is popularly
bland, not what is necessar-
ily good. Most stories

around cartoonish bands like The Prodigy,
or artists like U2 and David Bowie, who
have both chosen to incorporate more elec-
tronics into common pop songs.

What is present, then, is not the “next
big thing” at all, but merely a new opportu-
nity to rehash stale rock formulas with dif-
ferent rhythms and soundscapes. This is not
a bad thing, but it is shamefully naive to
shove people like The Prodigy and the
Chemical Brothers alongside acts like The
Invisible Scratch Pickles, Automator,

Tom Jenkinson, and Richard James and
call them all “electronica.”
Writers become problematic when
they and other media heads champion the
more commercial acts and continue to
ignore the artists who laid the foundation
for contemporary dance music. Today, in
much the same way that Christopher
Columbus “discovered” America, critics
(and rock musicians) are discovering club
culture. Unfortunately, these people do not
- want the make the effort to adapt to music
that does not directly reﬂect their

reality; they choose to
redeﬁne foreign areas in
their own image. The hype
surrounding electronic
music whitewashes issues of
race, gender, and genre.
Most articles championing commercial
dance musicians make a point of mention-
ing a debt to black electronic groundbreak-
ers like Derrick May or Juan Atkins. As a
music fan, I am forced to wonder why these
innovators are common reference points
but never the subject of large articles them-
selves.

America has been quite successful in
attempting to destroy its own art fomis by
anesthetizing and packaging them for mass
consumption. Techno music is an

American art form, just like hip—hop, jazz,
R&B, and rock and roll. They are almost all
forms of music derived from the ingenuity
of a precious few, lost to commercialism
and incredible ignorance.

The “next big thing” limits the vantage
point of music consumers and places major
attention on the “thing” itself. Expectations
of the “thing” become too high, and the
artists and music communities buckle
under the hype. On the business end, hype
almost always equals big salary advances
and little patience to allow artists to slowly
develop street credibility and solid fan
bases. Commercial success is simply about
power and who holds the financial reins.

To thosepurists who feel the irnpend—
ing doom of a sacred subculture is upon us,
fear not. Rock will go crazy for awhile
about how hip it is to have Cabbageboy
remix their new single, then discard the
many subcultures. They will say that they
are boring and dead, or perhaps just too
abstract, and eventually the critics and
executives will retum to the area that caters
to their notions of consummate musical
authority. They will leave the world of elec-
tronic music and start fawning over plain
old rock and roll’s immaculate rebirth.

loca|°DJs keep it real

Behind a modest booth set up in the back of a club. a slight.
shorthaired DJ is setting the mood for the night. He quickly
leans his head to the headphonesresting on his shoulder, gives
the record a slight push, and slides the crossfader. The mix
comes with authority. hard and fast. The crisp drum beats rip
through the speakers at 170 beats per minute. The bass line
booms and flows below and sets the crowd off. The rumbling
bass booms seductively. mesmerizing the crowd. The frantic,
skittering drumbeats hit like a musical wave and turn the floor
into- a sea of gyrating dancers. The syncopation of the fluid
undercurrent and precise percussives create a mood that com-
pletely enraptures the listeners‘. Welcome to the jungle.

For the next few hours. Damian “dieselboy” Higgins and
other jungle DJs will educate the crowd on the newest and best
tracks that jungle music has to offer. Higgins. one of the
nation’s most sought—after Dls. will take the dancers on a musi-

-cal journey. Spinning all facets of jungle. dieselboy rarely
leaves a crowd disappointed. '

This month. steelcityjungle will make a welcome return to
Pittsburgh. The show will take place on Tuesday. April 22. at
Laga on Forbes Avenue in Oakland. Those in attendance will
see dieselboy. 1.8.7.. Farmer.Tea. and MC Sphinx.

Every other Tuesday. steelcityjungle will feature guests
from all across the world. including DJ Delmar from Jungle
Sky Records and the Koncrete Jungle crew from New York ’
City. For those who are not fortunate enough to attend. a Real
Audio broadcast will be available on the Worldwide Web the
day after the show.

De La Soul
Stakes Is High
Tommy Boy I

Stakes Is High is an album
of maturity for De La Soul.

Stakes is High is their
fourth album. Their previous
albums are 3 Feet High and
Rising, De La (Soul is Dead,
and Bulhoone Mind State.

I put the CD in the stereo
with no idea what they would

, sound like this time around. If

anything, I was expecting the
happy. goofy sound of 3 Feet
High and Rising. I was sur-
prised to hear the first track on
De La Soul’s new album. I was-
n’t sure ifl liked hearing them
with a serious hip-hop beat.

I The tracks on this album
are far away from the silly,
happy beats they used on their
debut. »

The last half of the album
is better, but the whole album is
still worth buying. Whether you
buy music for the beat or the
lyrics, there is something here
for anyone who likes hip-hop.

lt’s an awesome chill-out
album. R&B and jazz sounds
are thrown in with voices har-
monizing in the background.

\Mth lyrics like “De La

De La Soul bring their Native Tongues sound to

Graffiti May 6.

Soul is here to stay like racism”
showing a serious side to their
music and to themselves as
musicians, they are here to stay.

On the end of track 10,
country music comes on and a
guy with a Southern accent
says, “Rap it sucks. I hate it. It
just don’t appeal to me. There’s
no music in it. It’s just niggers

ChasingAmy

Directed by Kevin Smith

With Benny Afﬂeck and Joey
Lauren Adams

Writer/director Kevin Smith has
added the third, soon-to-have-a-cult-
following film to his New Jersey trilo-
gy, following Clerks and Mallrats, in
Chasing Amy. Unlike his first two con-
tributions to the big screen, Smith has
made a movie more about relationships
than about raunch. Much to the amaze-
ment of movie watchers, Smith actual-
ly pulls it off. ,

Cartoonist Holden McNeil (Ben
Aflleck) meets fellow comic-book
writer Alyssa Jones (Joey Lauren
Adams) and falls almost immediately in
love. Instead of a typical boy-meets-
girl-with—boy romantic drama, Smith
gives theaudience a boy—meets—lesbian
tragedy. Holden has to deal with being
friends with his love interest, who has
no interest in the external—plumbing half
of humankind. But after confessing his
love to Alyssa in one of screen history’s
best love-between-friends battles ever,

Alyssa surprises the viewers by retum— ’

ing the affection after originally walk-
ing otf into the rain. .

I never quite bought the love story
that Smith had worked together, but the

’ dialogue between the two is exception-

ally smooth, but even smoother
between Holden and cornic—book part-

ner Banky Edwards (Jason Lee), who
returns in a role similar to his Mallrats’
character Brodie. Crass, vulgar, and
downright hilarious, Banky never holds
back in telling Holden what he thinks of
“dykes,” “fags,” and why blowjobs are
like the Weather Channel. As expected,
Holden’s friendship/relationship with
Alyssa sparks numerous heated debates
between him and Banky, which begins
to affect their comic book, “Bluntman
& Chronic," but more importantly, tliei1'
2()-year triendslrip. Eventually. a no
liolds—hzu‘r'ed light erupts between
everyone, and only one thing will save
all the relationships --~- a rnenage fr trois.

Some points in the movie are
touching, and some are distinctly Kevin
Smith (including all the crowd—arousing
references to Clerks and Mallrats).
Somehow, the two most opposite gen-
res in film work together well, proving
that Kevin Smith can actually write and
direct a legitimate ﬂick. Fans of his
work will be pleased to see the retum of
Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob
(played by Smith himself), except that
Silent Bob is anything but.

But as you’re bitching about Silent
Bob talking too much, think about what
he’s saying. He explains what “chasing
Amy” means, leading me to believe
that this movie is a somewhat autobiry
graphical piece for Smith. The ending
isn’t what anyone will expect, but it

What the Sailor Saw

“What was I saying?” he asks.

“Something about the old man and his habits:
chewing his tongue, never using the left eye.

Is this still considered a topic of interest for you?”

She looks at him from across the table:
lead-based, rat-infested,
says, “We never talk.”

Bleeding sun, bleeds across the carpet,
the fibers of wolf hair.

“Your feet are twitching,” he says.

She looks down, shrugs.

He takes her hand, places a thumb between swollen lips.
She sighs, eyes closed, head tilted, resting on one shoulder.
He carves the bird between them, ‘

turns on wrestling.

She rises, dishes in hand.

He stands, crosses hot coals, spots a figure in white out the win-
dow.
His pupils dilate, the entire orb now black.

And the sailor, shore leave for only a day,
watches from the street,

sees the figure seeing him,

thinks of his family

and promises himself

that his eyes will never leave

the shuffling of his feet.
