§3ii.i?§.‘fJZ'§{:..i‘e 702 Honor Students

To Attend Assembly

by DON MARBURY

The only other legislation con-
cerned immediate formation of
a fund raising drive toward a me-
morial for Dr. Edward Lithch-
field, former chancellor at the
University. The bill passed.

Although out of the meeting’s
spotlight, the much-hasseled-over
Liberal Arts -Cabinet chairman-
ship was decided upon. The sen-
ate approved of SG President Ken
Schueler’s nomination of Joe Ko-
cuibes, a nomination which fail-
ed to gain senate approval two
weeks ago.

The approval of Kocuibes re-
flected none of the controversy
surrounding the issue for the past
month. Senator Dave Guydan’s
suggestion to “keep a close eye
on the Liberal Arts Cabinet” was
the only comment made in con-
nection with the decision.

In addition to hearing reports
from the Library and Weekend at
Pitt Committees. the senate re-
viewed two Allocation Commit-
tee decisions. The committees rec-
ommended that Associated Wom-
en’s Students and Ideas and Fig-
ures receive no money from their
$150 and $568 requests. respective-
ly. The senate approved of both
decisions.

Vice-president Frank Tutino an-
nounced that the last formal meet-
ing of the term would be April 3.

“The Administration. the Fac-
ulty. and the Student Cabinet of
the College of Arts and Sciences
recognizes you as an honor stu-
dent and cordiallv invites you to
attend Honors Assembly.

This is part of the invitation
that 702 students have recieved
or will be receiving within the
next few days. Each year the Uni-
versity has a program to honor
those students who have a cumu-
lative quality point average of
3.25 or higher. This year 635 stu-
dents have attained a 3.25 or high-
er. and 67 students have attained
the rating of University Scholars
by setting a 3.75 or over. I

The Honors Assembly will be
held on April 2 at 3 p.m. in the
Ballroom of the Student Union
with a reception to follow at 4
in the Supper Room. The address
at the Assembly will be given by
Dr. Dexter Perkins. professor em-
eritus of history. Rochester and
Cornell Universities and former
professor of history at the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh. His topic will
be “Search for Peace Over 50
Years.”

Israel Holds Open Forum

vant to a major urban campus.

The forum has been organized
by two faculty members of the

UNIVERSITY OF PI'l'l‘SBURGH

Friday, March 29', I968’ 

D.r.Wesley Posvarlnaugurated Chancellor  

Acceptance Speech, Dinner,

Reception Follow Ceremony

.“We shall be in the center of the transformation of the
American society,” Dr. Wesley Wentz Posvar told 1,900 fac-

ulty, students, and guests at his inauguration as the 15th chan- ,
cellor in University history, Wednesday in the Carnegie Music '

Hall. a

The inaugural program began at 11:50 a.m. with a proces-

sional that included two hundred
and two delegates from colleges
and universities from across the
nation and the world. The cere-
mony took place at noon.

The Reverend John Baiz. D.D..
r e c to r of Calvary Episcopal
Church. gave the invocation.

Salutations were offered by
representatives of the academic
community, the faculty, the stu-
dent body, and the alumni. Court-
ney C. Smith, president of Swarth-
more College, gave the salutation
from the academic community;
George L. Fahey, president of the
University Senate, from the fac-
ulty; Ken Schueler, SG president,
from the students; and James B.
Say, president of the Alumni As-
sociation from the alumni.

William H. Rea. chairman of
the Board of Trustees, conducted
the investiture.

Dr. Posvar’s acceptance speech‘
followed. In it the Chancellor
reiterated his plans for the fu-
ture of the University. “Our fore-
most concern.” he said. “is with
quality. The rate of qualitative
improvement will exceed the rate
of physical growth. We are firm-
ly committed to qualitative prog-
ressf’

After his speech, Chancellor
Posvar conferred honorary de-
grees upon four educators who
have been influential as advisers
and friends during his career. The
four and their honorary degrees
are: Charles Johnston Hitch, pres-
ident of the University of Califor-
nia, Doctor of Laws; Colonel
George Arthur Lincoln, professor
and head of the Department of
Social Sciences at the US Mili-
tary Academy, Doctor of Laws;
Don K. Price, Jr., dean of the
John Fitzgerald Kennedy School
of Government at Harvard Uni-
versity, Doctor of Letters; and
Herbert George Nicholas, Fellow
of New College, Oxford, Eng-
land, Doctor of Laws.

Chancellofs Keynote
Our foremost concern is with
quality.

Throughout this time, the rate
of qualitative improvement will

exceed the rate of physical i .

growth.

We will become more con-
cerned vIe;th our own unique
character and purpose—to know
our special strengths and to re-
force them. i

A related characteristic of the
University of Pittsburgh that we
intend to develop is its coher-
ence as a community . . . to re-
late the functions of teaching
and research to one another.

The prestige and financial re-
wards of research contracts must
not overshadow the educational
needs of students.

The meaningful issue is stu-
dent demand for the right curri-
culum and the competent teach-
er and the environment condu-
cive to education.

The ceremony was followed by

a luncheon for invited guests, cam-,

pus tours, and Faculty Inaugural

Ball in the evening. The lunch- ,

eon and the ball were both held
in the Commons Room of the Ca-
thedral.

Dr. Posvar was elected to the.‘

chancellorship by the Board of
Trustees in January, 1967. He as-
sumed office last June coming to

the University from a position as _
chairman of the Political Science "
Department and head of the So- ,
cial Sciences Division at the US 1"
Air Force Academy in Colorado ;

Springs, Colo.

The chancellor is a graduate...
of the US Military Academy at-

West Point, N. Y. He subsequent-

ly earned a B.A. and an M.A. in

philosophy, politics, and econom-
ics as the Air Force's first Rhodes
Scholar at Oxford, and a Ph.D.
from Harvard.

Audience Put On

Page 3 — THE Prrr NEWS — Friday. March 29, 1.968

Warhol Discusses ‘Stars’

Andy Warhol’s film lecture presentation “Pop Art in Action
pacity last Tuesday. Varied is the word to describe the audience. There were a few token straights
in suits or crew necks, but, primarily. the listeners were long—haired and bedizen in beads or but-
tons while many held constantly flashing cameras.
Warhol’s day-long film Starts, a few words by way 0

the enigmatic Poppa of Pop.

The film. completed seven
months ago. proved a garbled
compendium of every cinematic
trick known to man. Scenes were
speeded up or slowed down then
superimposed so two. sometimes
three separate things were hap-
pening at once. Figures were min-
utely scrutinized or shot out of
focus or multiply exposed while
the dialogue was delayed then
played back till it seemed like
four people were taling when only
one could be seen on the screen.

The title Stars is misleading for
the only recognizable person in
the film was the self-styled Su-
perstar. Nico. who cavorted and
whistled and sang as the movie
rudely jumped from one indolent
bushy-haird male to another. The
rest of Stars was a series of im-
promptu jokes (often very racy)
and extemporaneous discourse on
such varied topics as Vietnam.
Truth. Hell’s Angels. Shriners.
Santa Claus. Magic Marker pens.
psychic echology. and the Ku
Klux Klan.

After the film, Warhol and his
entourage filed out onto the podi-
um to try and explainwhat the
audience had just seen. Stars is
a “visual novel” clarified one of
Warhol’s friends who prefered to
remain “Paul”; more a plotless
home movie than a purposeful
Hollywood type of thing. The
film operates on the literal prin-
ciples of the newsreel, he added,

which runs in “stop start” fash-
10", exposing the viewer to an
endless collage of sights and
sounds.

Warhol’s second traveling com-
panion. Viva. a tumble-weed-hair-
ed blonde dressed in a glen plaid
hacking jacket and black jump
suit. then put in a plug for Andy‘s
newest movie. Romeo and Juliet,
a cowboy movie shot in Tuscon.
Ariz.. in which “the girl gets the
boy."

Both Viva and Paul aided War-
hol. who seemed loath totalk
about anything. in warding off
pop questions from the audience.
When a certain hippie asked Vi-
va if Superstar Nico went both
ways she replied. "Well 1 room-
ed with her for a year and she
never came my way." A few of the
queries were downright antago-
nistic and questioned Warhol's
sexual orientation and the serious-
ness of his film theories.

Another student asked Warhol
to comment upon The Chelsea
Girls, to which Andy replied that
it was a “comedy” and, when the
pupil complained that he saw
nothing funny in it, Viva suggest-
ed that he either watch more
closely next time or get glasses.

It was all in fun, however, both
the audience and Andy’s gang
seemed to pass a pleasant 90 min-
utes putting each other on.

Everone was treated to an hour segment of

Tuition Hike

A complaint was lodged against the Commonwealth of Penn-
sylvania “financial irresponsibility Tuesday evening by the
Student Government (SG) Senate. The Senate believes that an
impending tuition hike is in “violation of a moral obligation to
provide low-cost education for Pennsylvania residents.”

The bill recommends that the Commonwealth grant the
funds necessary to maintain the present tuition of Pennsylvania
residents enrolled at the University and that the state “adopt a
suitable fiscal structure to provide exclusive revenues to subsi-
dize higher education.” .

This fine and needed gesture on the part of SG. is not an
isolated complaint. And this from our point of view. is a for-
tunate circumstance. There are a number of state legislators who
stress the need for financial responsibility.

Senator Earnest B. Kline has offered his solution to the fi-
nancial dilemma. He has called for an Education Resources
Development Authority “to attack the fundamental. financial

r problems of all phase of education in Pennsylvania. Under this
plan. the Authority would borrow up to 500 million dollars over
the next three years. During this time. according to the Kline
plan. the Legislature would examine the aspects of the fiscal
dilemma in order to perpetuate the development of education."

The Kline plan and other plans, includingSG’s have called

for the legalization of horse racing and the establishment of a
state lottery. These ideas offer an alternative to the present fi-

I A . nancialdespondency.

We must agree with SG. Senator Kline. and all other pro-
ponents of alternatives to our fiscal dilemma. The University
and consequently the students have been emanating from the thin
financial ropes that emanate the State Capitol for some time.
‘Any tuition hike. we suggest. will be the result of the failure of
A the Commonwealth to mend its political differences and re-
solve a sound fiscal program. And we intend to use all the re-
sources of “Student Power” to fight any tuition hike.

A number of journalists and modern thinkers have recently
' stated that there is a growing feeling of a"nit-Americanism in
present day American society. These people contend that some
of the attitudes of our society have caused a number of persons.
especially those of the academic and intellectual communities.
to maintain hostile attitudes towards American beliefs and
attitudes.

This is a serious indictment of American society but it is un-
‘ ’ fortunately a truism. A great many Americans have lost pride

1 _ in their society. But this loss of pride is not due to material

hardship. Nor; is it rooted in many of our social customs. The
crux of the problem lies in this nation’s attitude towards war.

‘ 7 ' ‘And this attitude. in our view. has been the cause of our socie-

tal disquiet.

In this new era of uncompromising American military com-
mitment. the clear visions of world peace through diplomacy
and international agreement have faded into the abstract pic-
ture of the American flag placed on top of strategic Vietna-
mese hill——a conquest that nudges the American military ma-
chine an inch closer of overall military victory.

But recent events such as the Tet offensive clearly indi-

’ cate that the occupation of a strategic hill or hamlet means
next to nothing in our war of attrition. But President Johnson
has nevertheless. maintained his senseless and irrational military
commitment. He maintains this commitment even though a

great percentage of American populace rejects his position.

This irascibitity and obstinance has caused many educated
Americans to lose their faith in the traditional American way
of life. Many scholars and journalists have recently become
overtly subversive. In short. this dilemma of anti-Americanism
. has reached an intolerable level——a plateau that necessitates the
- defeat of Lyndon Baines Johnson. the gread divider of Ameri-

;‘G0 Directly To Jail...”

We were on our way to the po-
lice station. Twenty—three of us
sweated in the small compart-
ment of the police van. Our mo-
rale was high: we recited the
Pledge of Allegiance on the way
to Precinct number four and em-
phasized the phrase. “liberty and
justice for all." '

Then jail was our residence for
only an hour because Chancellor
Wesley Posvar put up bond mon-
ey and we were released. We
were told that. if we wanted. we
could go to court the next morn-
ing. And so begins my lesson of
life.

I have always had the naive be-
lief that judges and court pro-

ceedings were fair. On March 19.
1968. they apparently were not.
There was never a mention that
a lawyer would be provided if I
desired one. I was not asked to
plead "guilty" or “not guilty."

And the officers present never
remembered me being arrested
and none claimed to be that per-
son who apprehended me. The
judge. Magistrate John Seville.
asked me how the disturbance be-
gan. I told him.

~ Thd judge asked the police what
they did. They told him. He then
fined me two dollars for disorder-
ly conduct.

I being a person who had a
high regard for police officers
and judges. changed many of my
views during those two days. I
should not believethat all of Pitts-
burgh's finest are crude. but I am
finding it difficult to do other-

Truth Is Beauty

Everyone Forgets It

by BRUCE LEVENSON

The truth is the most beautiful thing in the world. The
truth is one of the most real things in the world. Reality itself

is the truth.

' The truth is losing its value. Nowadays we hear as little of the
truth as possible. We ofen hear the truth censored, manipulated. turn-

ed over. flipped around. or push-
ed aside. The truth is told only
when it is convenient. When the
truth is not told it is to obscure
a realilty that is either too hard
for the person who knows it to ac-
cept or the people he is trying to
keep it from to accept.

NON -‘ ACCEPTANCE ofthe
truth or manipulation of the truth
is running from reality — is run-
ning from the world — is not ac-
cepting the fact that the world
is not a perfect place and that
there is no such thing as a per-
fect person.

EDITORIAL COMMENT
YEAR AGO TODAY

The recent controversy over
Auxiliary Enterprises Director
John C. Langstaff’s ownership
of Your Campus Store suggest-
ed the necessity of thoroughly
re-evaluating the operation of
the University Book Center and
present alternative propojs
concerning its operation to the
Administration.

While the book centers at our
regional campuses are report-
edly accruing profits, our own
Book Center operates at a sup-
posed deficit. We are unaware
of the precise financial status
of our Book Center, however,
since a profit-and-loss state-
ment was not made available
to us. The statement was with-
held from us in spite of the fact
that a few years ago Vice Chan-
cellor for Finance Lawrence
Monnett and the the Student
Government (SG) President
John Vrana signed an agree-
ment to divide the Book Cen-
ter profits between the Univ-.
versity and SG’s share allocat-
ed for student activities.

The Monnett - Vrana agree-
ment is meaningless if the Book
Center nvever makes a profit.
This state of affairs leads us to
propose altenative plans that
would better enable the Book
C e n t e r to serve our student
body . . .

We urge SG to rise to the oc-
casion of representing th_e stu-
dents’ interest in this instance.

 

A case in ‘point is last Tuesday
night. Police Superintendent
James Slusser has denied time and
again that the police force used
any brutality in quelling the dis-
turbance. I. for one, know that
they did. All the denials in the
world will not change what hap-
pened Tuesday night.

MANIPULATION of the truth is
being carried on at the Nation-
al Government level. This is some-
thing we all know — but we don’t
much care lg We actually think gov-
ernment has a right to keep the
truth. from us. We think it is for
our own good. The only thing that
is for our won good is the truth,
good or bad. By accepting the bad
things along with the good is the
only way we can progress. If we
lie unpleasant truths away. they
will keep returning. The first step
in combating them is to admit
their existence.

An example of this is the moun-
tain of criticism that has been
heaped upon the Warren Commis-
sion Report. Any evidence that
could possibly prove the Warren
Commission wrong is locked away
in the National Archives and won’t
be available until the year 2030!
If the report critics are wrong.
why won’t the Johnson Adminis-
tration allow them to prove them-
selves wrong? Just keep. in mind
that one of George Orwell’s main
points in “1964” was ‘complete
government control of the truth.

ON YET ANOTHER level. I
see more and more of my friends
and my other contacts who almost
never tell the truth. I’m not talk-
ing about lying but just little un-
important fibs (the common term
is BS). If everthing happened to
these people that they say. then
they would all be Supermen, Wil-
lie Mays. James Bonds. and Phi
Beta Kappas. I’m sick and tired of

1 carrying on a lot of non-conversa-

tions with a lot of people.

I ONLY ASK that we all face
the truth. We all have shortcom-
ings. the world is not a perfect
place. nothing is perfect. Let us
start from there and we can strive
to make ourselves and our world
better. But the first step on the
road to improvementjis realiza-
tio --and reality is the truth. 1’

America’s
Second

Civil War

by GEORGE LIES
Associate Editor

The battle had now been rag-
ing for three days and three
nights. Fires had spread through-
our the area. Countless numbers
of persons had been killed or
wounded. More damage had

been done than

ever before in
cluding Detroit
Watts. Rochest-
e r . Cincinnati.
a n d Pittsburgh
combined.

No one believ-
ed the President’s L 
Kerner report and G. LIES
that was 16 years ago. when some-
thing could have been done.

But now it was 1984.

And America. the land of beau-
ty. was being destroyed.

      
   

SIX YEARS ago. the Americ-
can society had been split just as
the Kerner report forecasted. The
Negroes had taken over the cities:
the whites lived in the suburbs.

For six years now. the two so-
cieties have existed under separ-
ate constitutions. They have dealt
with mutual problems and mu-
tual differences through the Unit-
ed States ‘Organization. headed
by the President.

But seven months ago. the two
groups argued over the rights of
the highways; representatives
walked out of the talks. And only
two weeks ago. the military was
brought in on both sides.

BUT THE pressing problem
was to avoid a second Civil War.

The President asked to negoti-
ate with one representative from
each group.

Remembering the 1968 Kerner
Report‘s basic conclusion. that.
“Our nation is moving toward two
societies. one black. one white-
separate and unequal.” the Presi-
dent acted to sooth the wounds
created by racism’s results.

“WHY?” he asked. “Why do
you fight each other?”

“Why did you let your local
governments decay at the hands
of corrupt politicians? It was your
only hope to develop neighbor-
hood action task forces to improve
communications and services be-
tween the two groups." he said.

“My office. as you both know.
no longer has the power to con-
trol America as one undivided na-
tion.“ continued the President.
"After the Vietnam pullout in
1972. the entire country turned
on Johnson and the Presidency.
Federal government is no longer."

“THAT IS WHY I plead with
you two to save America. You
both need each other. but now
you are both suffering. You're at
each other’s throat and this is no
good." said the President.

“You both must reevaluate your
positions. Both of you must give
a little. and learn from the other.
Cooperation is America."

“That is why I plead with you.
I beg you. don't let America die."
said the President.

University of Pittsburgh

Dear Sir:

I was one of the many service-
men who attended college after
World War II. and will forever
be grateful to government for giv-
ing me an opportunity I probably
would not have otherwise been
able to afford. I have never re-
sented the Veteran's Administra-
tion for not providing me with
air conditioned quarters.

Those students who waste their
time protesting for air condition-
ing. should be spanked. given a
bowl of Pablum. and put to bed.

Those who protest in the streets.
and thus disrupt the life of the
city. should be expelled.

Those who refuse to disperse
upon police orders and pelt them
with mud balls. are hoodlums.
and should be cracked on the head
with a night stick. on the off chance
that the blow might rearrange their
brain cells in more favorable or-
der.

Test Director Hits Tiernan

March 27 , 1968
Editor. The Pitt News:

This letter is partly in reply to
Dave Tiernan’s article in the March
22 Pitt News, but mostly in praise
of the behavior of the 685 Liberal
Art Students tested in Syria Mos-
que who aided the University in
setting up norms for second-year
transfer students. Mr. Tiernan‘s
article is a bit distorted because
it does not reflect the excellent
behavior of the majority of stu-
dents taking the test.

With few exceptions. the stu-
dents approached the test in a ma-
ture manner. and in doing so. were
a credit to themselves and to the
University of Pittsburgh.

Mr. Tiernan states. that the in-
structions for the test were kin-
dergarenish. All instructions giv-
en for handing ort materials. fill-
ing out the answer sheets. collect-
ing the answer sheets. were pre-
scribed by a national test organiz-
ation. Educational Testing Serv-
ice. These instructions a r e th e
same as those given for such tests
as College Boards. Graduate Rec-
ord Exams and the Law Admis-
sions Exams. etc.

If Mr. Tiernan thinks these rules
are childish. he should» write to
Educational Testing Service and
express himself on this matter. We
at the Testing Service feel that
the rules made by Educational
Testing Service are practical and

allow for the most efficient ad-
ministration of the tests.

As to the motivation of the stu-
dents. the impression of the Test-
ing Service was that the students.
in actuality. had good motivation.
The room was quiet during the
test. and almost all students were
giving serious attention to read-
ing and answering the test items.

The "proctor“ referred to at the
end of the article who thanked the
students for their cooperation and
allowed them to leave early was
Dr. Norman Mulgrave. associate
dean of Liberal Arts.

In conclusion. the Testing Serv-
ice would like to thank the ma-
jority of students for helping us
set up standards for students to
be admitted to the University of
Pittsburgh.

Sincerely ours.

Reaccept The
Jailed Grads

March 17.
Editor. The Pitt News:

Recently the administrations of
Princeton and Yale ahd the fac-
ulty of Columbia University have
declared that those students who.
based on their personal moral con-
victions. elect to go to jail rather
than be inducted to fight in Viet-
nam will be unconditionally re-
accepted by the graduate schools
of those universities after their re-
lease.

1968

Several other leading universi-
ties are expected to make similar
declarations in the near. future.

We feel that the Office of the
Dean of the Faculty of Arts and
Sciences could perform a valuable
service to the seniors and current
graduate students of this universi-
ty if it would issue a definitive
statement of its proposed policy
regarding students whose convic-
tions preclude the possibility of
their entrance into the armed
forces.

Such a statement would be most
welcome at this time. -

  Profiles Present Major Candidates Views

In an interview with Godfrey Sperling Jr. of
The Christian Science Monitor, Former Vice-Presi-
dent Richard M. Nixon called for “a new policy
to shorten the war.” in which “massive pressure"
would be used — short of using nuclear power to end
the war.

Nixon considers the past election as denoting
great progress. However, because their election was
imperfect at this point. is no reason to “condemn
them forever to the system which they have now
elected to leave.” _

Foreign-policy objectives must creat new alli-
ances — multilateral if possible. bilater if necessary
— which would keep Germahy solidly on the West-
ern side. Foreign aid needs a complete overhaul.
“The United States should use its aid programs to
reward our friends and discourage our enemies.”

The only answer to the Communist threat. feels
Nixongis to maintain a military superiority. The
development of an anti-ballistic missile system is a
necessary invertment in peace. Economically.
“more trade with the Soviet Union should be en-
couraged. However. there should be no extension
of long—term_credit or trade in strategic items with
any country that is aiding North Vietnam.

Nixon takes a position against a tax increase. “I
believe that the provatesector is soft and uncertain.

Thus. a higher tax might produce less revenue than"

now.” .

Concerning the crisis in the cities. “first things
should come first. Something has to be done about
the poverty — to correct it.’—’ However. there can be
no progress without the rule of law. There must
be a stop to the violence. “We need national lead-
ership that will implement civil-rights legislation
already on the books. I think the President has fal-
led down in terms of leadership during this crisis."

ferences.

Kennedy

Senator Kennedy has come out in his
most decisive campaign stand to date: be-
ing against the Vietnam war. Senator Ken-
nedy advocates an immediate end to the
bombing. and a general deescalation of
the war in general. The senator also be-
lieves that the US should include the Na-
tional Liberation Front in the negotiations
which this country should be conducting
in an effort to bring peace in Vietnam.

On the subject of the draft. Senator
Kennedy recently stated that he could not
say whether or not one should or should
not evade the draft. or even completely
refuse induction. The senator said that
each person has to examine his own cons-
cience and to what he thinks is right. He

said that if he himself was called up. he
would go.

Senator Kennedy has alsokexpressed
his views on the urban problems in the

McCarthy

Eugene McCarthy. the Democratic sen-
ator from Minnesota. is battling LBJ be-
cause of “indications that the Administra-
tion has no plans for Vietnam other than
continued secalation and intensification."
McCarthy repudiates the theory of a "yel-
low peril" and feels that the best indica-
tion of any intention to change present for-
eign policy “would be the resignation of
the Secretary of State."

In a recent interview with US News
and World Report the Senator favored an
end to the bombing of North Vietnam with-
out prior conditions because such action
“is probably hardening Hanoi’s attitude
toward negotiations.“ McCarthy prefers
a cease-fire before peace talks begin. but
would be willing to negotiate while the
fighting goes on. T

The Minnesota senator thinks it "im-
possible to deny the National Liberation
Front a significant role . . through a
coalition or some other type of govern-
ment (which) is for the Vietnamese to
decide."

McCarthy feels the Senate has been
placed in an impotent role on foreign po-
licy. Despite their efforts to restrict the
Administrations actions. they have been
ineffectual.

Johnson

President Johnson. through the depart-
ment of State has indicated that our in-
volvement in Vietnam stems from “grim
lessors of the past.“ “It has been demon-
strated that retreat in the face of agression
only led to more agression and. eventually.
to total war.“ According to the Depart-
ment of State again. “A central task of our
nation must be to pursue and organized
peace in which all nations and peoples
cooperate for their mutual welfare.

The objectives in Vietnam are: to ob-
tain peace through negotiations of all par-
ties involved in the conflict. to assure the
poeople of South Vietnam that they may
determine their own future free of inva-
sion and terrorism. to help them build a
democratic political institution and prog-
ressive economy. to make US commit-
ments credible. and finally to build a co-
operative association of Southeast Asian
countries.

Concerning the draft situation. the pre-
sent administration is granting deferments
for undergraduate students. and graduate
students in the health professions only.

Mr. President Johnson is in favor of a
tax increase to stabalize the economy and
the position of the dollar.

McCarthy Offers a Choice

Students Give Power

ToMcCarthyCampaign

by DAVID BAER

“Ft. Lauderdale is out and
McCarthy is in, 40,000 stu-
dents have volunteered to
work for McCarthy over the
spring vacation.” These are
the words of David Mixner,
the national director of Students
for McCarthy, who held a news-
conference in Pittsburgh on Tues-
day, March 27.

Mixner says that Gene Mc-
Carthy is what this country has
been looking for. “Now the Amer-
ican people want a voice of rea-
son and rationale. They want a
choice. And now they have it.”
Mixner adds that McCarthy is an
“honest man, one we can believe
in.”

When asked if he was support-
ing Robert Kennedy,‘Mixner said
that he was “for Gene McCarthy
all the way." He was then asked
what he felt the differences were
in Senator McCarthy’s s-tands and
Senator iKennedy’s policies. Mix-
ner said that there were actually

quite a few differences in the
two candidates’ views. One major
difference in their views is on the

-Selective Service system, asserts

Mixner.

Kenedy feels that although he
does not agree with the present
draft system, there is very little
he can do about it, according to
Mixner. McCarthy, on the other
hand, is advocating a policy of
“selective consciencious objec-
tion.” By this he means that men
who really feel a war is morally
wrong will not have to serve.
Mixner also criticized Kennedy
because he has not articulated
a definite plan for ending the
war in Vietnam.

Mixner says that LBJ was go-
ing to have trouble getting elect-
ed. He said that the poverty pro-
gram was almost non-existent,
and that he thinks President John-
fears both McCarthy and Kenne-
dy.

Mixner said that it was student
power that was pushing McCar-
thy’s campaign. When asked what

‘Pitt News’ Review

Album Uses Hippie Culture

by JOE ANDERSON

The value of any kind of music
should not lie solely in its sensu-
ous- appeal. The sheer pleasure of
a particular sound is not necessar-
ily tantamount to the ultimate
worth or the greatest virtue that
that song may possess. If a mus-
ical work has only its emotional
effects to rely on then it soon be-
comes dull after the first few
plays. Pathos is just one of the
three aspects of a “successful”

~ song; the other... two being the

quality of expression and the
technical structure. Often these
aspects are so intermixed that
it is useless, if not senseless, to
try and separate them.

What all this is leading up to
is the latest album by the moth-
ers in invention-—We’re Only In
It For The Money (V6-5046X).
All three of the aforementioned
qualities of a “successful” song
are de-veloped_to their fullest ex-
tent on this album. Yet each of
these qualities is so intrinsic to
the record as a whole that it is
difficult to single out any one
of them. .

Take the song “bow tie daddy.”
It captures the sound appeal of
the l920’s and the 1930’s Rudy
Vallee era and yet has the tech-
nical structure and arrangement
of a rock and roll piece. Expres-
sively, it simply entreats “bow
tie daddy” not to “blow your
cool” and “just go on with your
drinkin’.”

The point to be made here is
that “bow tie daddy” works be-
cause each part of the song sup-
ports the theme of the song—a
communication’ gap exists be-
tween the young and the old. The
Rudy Vallee sound represents the
older generation while the rock
arrangements signifies the young-
er. A. mood of sardonic delight is
created by the lyrics and SW05
meaning and purpose to the mus-
ic itself. Basically this same
‘scheme is followed in the rest
of the songs on the album.

“Who needs the peace corps"
is a tongue-in-cheek look at the
hippie culture with its “psyche-
delic dungeons popping up On
every street.” “Mom and dad"
tells what happens when Parents

lose contact with their children.

  -.

 

park today . . . by the side of the
creeps she knew.” Mom and dad
killed their daughter just as
much as the cops who shot her.
Another attack on the Hippie
culture by its most ardent ad-
mirers, the mothers of invention
is “flower punk,” sung to ‘the
tune of “Hey Joe”—“Hey Punk
where you goin’ with that ﬂower
in your hand? Well, I'm goin’ up
the Frisco to join a psychedelic
band.” Another song, “let’s make
the water turn black,”‘ describes

the “creepy” world of little ken-we

ny and ronnie who, since they are
left alone during the day while
their parents work, are forced to
make their own amusement.
Kenny burns his “poots away”
and ronnie “saves his nummies
on a window in his room.”

We’re Only In It For The Mon-
ey ,is arranged as one continuous
song. In the near future Frank
Zappa, the main brain of the
Mothers, plans to score and have
the group cut a complete instru-
mental record which again will
be one continuous song called
“lumpy gravy.” A short preview
as to what “lumpy gravy” will
sound like is found in the last
song on this album called “the
chrome plated megaphone of des-
tiny.” From this song it appears
that the mothers of invention are
experimenting in the avaxnt-garde
classical style with its disjointed
sounds, mixed tapes, dissonance,
and elaborate sliding effects.

This forthcoming product of
the zappian imagination will most
likely have to be labeled the first
“classical rock” sound. But for
right now there exists We’re On-
ly In It For The Money and here
one finds the Mothers at their
inventive best.

McCarthy had going for him, Mix-
ner responded, we have money,
we have student power, and we
have the power of reason.”

When told that “students can’t
vote" Mixner noted that “they
didn-’t vote in New Hampshire.”
He said that it is the students
who are going out and getting the
votes. They are ringing the door-
bells, and speaking to the people.
Mixner said that there was “ma-
moth student support in Pitts-
burgh.” He said McCarthy was
going to stop LBJ on the first bal-
lot at the national convention,
and then win the nomination on
one of the following ballots.

Conflicting Sentiments

A free showing of Viet-
nam films will be presented

by the Pitt YWCA Thurs-
day in Dining Room A of the

Student Union from 4:00-
6 :15 p.m. The films will de-
pict both pro and anti-Vietnam
conflict sentiments.

Included in the showing will
be David Schoenbrun’s Vietnam:
How did we get in? How can we
get out? Schoenbrun, a journalist-
historian, has been an eye wit-
ness to the history of Vietnam
since World War II when Ho Chi
Minh was an ally of the United
States. A CBS correspondent for
15 years, he was the only Ameri-
can correspondent to witness the
defeat of France by the Vietna-
mese at Dien Bien Phu, and was
also Dyes-ent at the Geneva Con-
ference in 1954. He has just re-
turned from a six week trip to
Hanoi at the invitation of Ho Chi
Minh. His film is a blueprint for
action and a historical document
addressed to those who want to
see a logical presentation of the
background of the conﬂict by a

Also to be shown is the State
Department’s Why Vietnam which
makes the administration’s case
for presence there. This film
makes the points that the US
forces in South Vietnam are there
to fulfill a solemn pledge of as-
sistance against Communist Ag-
gression. The pledge resolves that
we will not surrender and we
will not retreat; that we have
learned from bitter experience
that appeasement is an invitation
to further aggres-sion, and we are
ready to negotiate a peaceful
and honorable settlement.

The British film Vietnam: the
Journal of a War, will also be
shown. Through .interviews and
narrated war footage it covers
a range of topics from the Budd-
hist revolt to the bombing and
civilian casualties.

Included in the film showing
will be “The Magician.” A mili-
tary officer interests a group of
young boys in a deserted shoot-
ing gallery; amusement turns in-
to enjoyment if the powers of
destruction — A Short Vision is
an animated film about the end
of the world. Another brief ani-
mated film, The Hole, explores
the possibility of a final, fatal
thermo-nuclear explosion in a dis-
cussion between two construction

workers. This film won the Aca- .

demy Award for Best Cartoon
Short Subject in 1962 and the
Blue Ribbon Award, American
Film Festival, 1963.

MITTERS (left to right) Dave Welty, Ken Cooke,
and Tom Smith provide much of the power for this
season’s baseball team. Welty, a pitcher, is. slated
to start against Indiana State Monday. Shortstop

Mitters Visit Indiana State

Cooke and first baseman Smith performed solidly
in spring training and hope to continue the.ir suc-
cesses in the regular season.

Welty Hnrls   Opener Monday

by JERRY GRUEBEI.

Baseball coach Bobby Lewis started ace
left-hander Dave Welty in the opening
game of the California Tournament, ex-
pected a win, and got it. With the regular season
starting Monday against Indiana State, Lewis plans
to start Welty again and get the same—-—if not bet-
ter, results.

Against Kansas, Welty lasted only five innings.
Poor support in the field led to the All-America’s
downfall. However, the mitters managed to stay
close, despite committing five errors, and went on
to win 9-8 in 11 innings.

At the time, the Panther baseballers were hand-
icapped by a lack of outdoor practice. But a week
of seven spring training games in sunny California
followed by this week’s practices in unusually warm
Pittsburgh weather should have the mitters prop-
erly prepared for the opener at Indiana State.

Another factor in Welty’s favor is that Indiana
shouldn't be as tough as the competition that the
mitters faced in Riverside, California.

“None of the competition will be tougher than
what we faced in California,” explained Lewis after
returning from the West Coast. “Some of the teams
might be as tough, but not tougher.”

As for Indiana State, however, Lewis can only

speculate. ,

“They’ll give us a good game,” said Lewis.
“They usually have strong baseball teams.”

Lewis knows one sure fact about Indiana State;
they have a tough left-handed pitcher, Jack Flapp.
And Lewis expects Flapp to be tossing against the
baseball team Monday.

‘_‘Last year, we beat Indiana’ State, 1-0,” said
Lewis. “Flapp pitched that one.”

The shutout was hurled by Don Stock, who has
since graduated.

If Welty returns to last year’s form, Indiana
State could be shutout again. Welty only surrend-
ered two earned runs last season, while compiling
a brilliant 0.33 ERA. ' .

But Welty is only human. Regardless of how
well he pitches, he can’t afford to be as poorly sup-
ported in the field as he was against Kansas.

Since that game, however, things have changed.
For one, Lewis now starts Cliff Brown at second
base, instead of Rich Mack. Mack was charged
with three errors in the spring training opener.

And the infield has improved with the playing
time they've had. Lewis was pleased with his in-
field of Rick Snyder, Ken Cooke, Cliff Brown, and
Tom Smith, from left to right, when the mitters
returned from the seven-game round-robin tourna-
ment.

Hope to Wipe Out Jinx

by MARTHA HARTLE
Coach Ben Pope’s znetters have lost ten straight match-
es to West Virginia over the past five years, but both the
coach and team are optimistic about ending that jinx
Monday when they travel to Morgantown.
“I think the boys are set to break that jinx,” said Pope. “At
least we hope to break it. We’re ready for them. The only advantage
they have over us so far has been in the weather. They got much

more practice, and that means a lo .”

The Panthers started practice March 1, but haven’t been able to
move outside until about ten days ago.

Last year, the Mountaineers
won both matches. In the home
encounter, the margin was 6-3.
But according to the coach, if his
number four man Eric Lieber-
man had been there, the outcome
could have easily been reversed.

Lieberman won’t be around for
Monday‘s match either; he grad-
uated. But a few new faces and
a couple of familiar ones will be
there.

Those familiar faces include
Bill Nichols, last year's number
one man who upset Bethany’s
Kirk Hunter and Youngstown’s
John Keil. Hunter had won 37
straight matches, while Keil was
riding an 18-match streak.

Senior Bob Salem.brier returns ’

as number two mam» and will
serve as the squad’s captain. De-
scribed by coach Pope as his most
consistent winner, Tom Stromp is
another court veteran. Last year,
as a sophomore, Stromp won 10
out of 13 matches.

New faces for the netters in-
clude John King and J. D. Lewis.
Lewis, only a'freshman, had been
ranked both first and second in
the state of North Carolina.

Overall, the coach described
his team’s strength as about the
same as last year’s, when the
netters finished ,7-5-1.

“We might improve by one or
two more possible wins. It’s hard
to tell.”

The netters would like nothing
better than to make that one
more win a jinx breaker.

Peery Looks for Golf Improvement;
West Virginia Hosts Duffers Monday

Although» the snow just
melted from last weekend’s

storm, golf season opens
Monday. The opener will be at
West Virginia.

Varsity golf mentor, Rex Peery,
feels that the season is jumping
in on him as he comments, “Yes,
it’s here already. But, we’re
ready!”

Peery looks upon the rushing
campaign somewhat optimis-tica1-
ly.

“Our boys will shoot in the
high 70's, sometimes around 73-
74.” The latter scores are the
kind that keep Peery smiling.

The four golfers who can do
his low scoring are Bill Bryan,
Jthn Delluverson, Rick Golden,
and Pete Keller. They are all re-
turning from a team that posted
a 6-8 record last year.

“We were disappointed in not hi-
getting that .500 last year,” Peery

What makes Peery think that

“We have two new golfers who
will more than make up_for,the. ,

 

ones we lost,” Peery mentions.
These additions are John Meteny
and Joe Volanski. Two others who
s-aw action in two fall practice

tom and Mike McGuire.

“Those fall trials were some-
thing new. It should help us,”
Peery says. Those practice "ses-
sions will probably benefit the
team. The long layoff during the
winter months can hurt a golfer’s
score, and all the practice he can
get is important.

The team will get all the prac-
tice it wants this week—but it
will count on their record. The
opener at West Virginia is the
first match of a home-and-home
series that will be completed at
the Panther’s ho-me course, the
Shannopin Country Club, on April
25. Last spring’s series wound up
deadlocked as each team won
their home match.

The week won't end until the
Pitt golfers are forced to compete
again. This one will be at Car-
negie-Mellon, Friday

 

 

    

matches were Henry Higgenbot-

After this week’s matches the
schedule is open for seventeen
days due to finals. But, this rest
will be the last for awhile. There
will be twelve matches played
in the month that follows. The
competition is similar to that of
last year’s and Peery knows what
schools to look for as being tough
foes.

“Ohio U. and Indiana State (in
a three-team match), Navy, and
Penn State will be the rough ones.
They have some pretty good golf-
ers,” the coach remarks.

After the opener Monday, Peery
should have some evidence as to
whether his team can battle that
competition or not. He doesn’t ex-
pect West Virginia to be as big a
threat, but he doesn’t expect an
easy time of it, either.

The coach is looking for a .500
showing. Good performances may
raise his expectations. They may
even force their coach into be-
lieving that they can go against

Tomorrow

While spring football is.
still several weeks in the
offing, spring soccer is well

under way. Although there is no I

organized practice, every Wed-
nesday most of the remaining
members of the soccer squad meet
at Trees Hall to work out.

“There are several purposes,
for having these practices,” com-
mented head coach Leo Bemis.
“First, the freshman players

don’t really get to know the up- ,

perclassmen in the fall.— These
practices develop togetherness.
We are working to build a team,

“Second, we are doing work
to improve our game skills,” con.
tinued Bemis. “And third, we're
working on conditioning, although
there’s not much we can do.
There has been some physical de.
velopment of the players.”

The team was scheduled to
scrimmage the foreign students
last Saturday, but due to the
weather the scrimmage was mov.
ed indoors. Tomorrow the squad
meets a soccer club from Car.

TERRY HOOVER
Double Winner

Mad House
Wins Dorm
Track Meet

Paced by double winner
Norm Roux, Mad House
edged Panther House to win
the dorm track and field crown
Wednesday afternoon.

Roux took first place in both
the high jump and broad jump
competitions. His leap of 5’8” in
the high jump was one inch shy
of the dorm record which he set
last year. In the broad jump, he
turn.ed in a 18’11%” performance,
which sets ‘a record since this
marks the first year the event
has been held in the dorm meet.

In the remaining field event,
Joe Curtin, representing Strat-
ford House, won the shot put with
a toss of 40’2”. 0

Mad House’s Price set the only
record in the track portion of the
meet with a 5:04 performance in
the mile. The previous record
of 5:05 was set in 1965.

Pleasure Palace won the 440-

yard relay in 52.1 seconds, edg- "

,ing Panther by .8 second. Tom
Mauro, Warren Allen, Stein and
Somple were the winning run-
ners for the Palace.

Panther House copped the mile
medley relay with a time of 4:24.

In other events, Tom Maure,
Pleasure Palace, won the 50-yard
low hurdles in 7.4 seconds while
Suther1and’s Hall won the 220-
yard dash in 26.5 seconds.

Final point totals for the meet
were Mad (44), Panther (32),
Pleasure Palace (28), Sutherland
House (16), Stratford (15), Play-
boy’s Penthouse (7), Hawthorne
House (7) and Random House
(6).

Entries are now being accept-
ed in the intramural office for
summer softball teams.

BOWLING ENDS

A bad finish and some tough
breaks along the way spelled
trouble for the varsity bowling
team this season. The keglers
finished with an 8-16 record in
the Western Pennsylvania Inter-
collegiate League.

Four regulars were gone from
last year's 21-7 team, and as a
result, the team lost seven of its
last eight games. Even then, four
of the 16 losses were by one or
two pins.

Hoover ands Top Awards at All-S ports Dinner

by ROY JACOBS
Sports Editor
Terry Hoover and Dave Welty carried most of the
heavy hardware home from last night’s All-Sports Ban-
quet, but twelve other varsity athletes were also honored

by their teams and coaches.

Hoover received two special awards—the Pitt News Sports Award
and the Charles C. Hartwig Award. The Hartwig Trophy is presented
to the student who has done the most to promote athletics at Pitt.
Hoover earned three letters in wrestling, compiling a 15-10-4 lifetime
record, and two letters in football. This past season he placed third
in the Eastern wrestling championships.

Welty was tabbed the baseball team’s most valuable player by
coach Bob Lewis, and he also received the Eastern College Athletic
Conference medal for the best combination of academic and athletic
achievement at the University. A math major, Welty maintains a
2.72 Q.P.A. Last season he led all major college pitches in strike-
outs per game, averaging 14.6.

One other special award was presented, that being the Athletic
Committee Award, given to the senior who best combines scholarship,
all-aroumd athletic ability, sportsmanship, and aptitude. The recipient
was Bob Bazylak, quarterback of the football team, who is heading
into med school after posting a 3.40 Q.P.A.

Eleven other MVP’s included:

  

  

BOB BAZYLAK

> Basketball-—Pete Smith; co-captain, cited for his total hustle.
> Cross Country—Paul Grieg; captain, owner of the school’s two-

> Track—-Roger Holly; IC4A finalist in the 600-yard run.

> Wrestling—Bruce Uunangst; undefeated in dual meet competi-

The highlight of the evening, following the presentations, was an
address delivered by Peter Carlesimo, Director of Athletics at the
University of Scranton. And an extra added attraction was the music

of the Pitt Panthers.

26 Miles in 4 Hours

Gerson To Enter  Marathon

by ART ROSENGARTEN
For most students, April
20th marks the end of fin-

als and the start of a long
vacation. To one Pitt student, that
date holds a special significance.
It’s Marathon day in Boston and
that is where junior Jeff Gerson
will be trying to earn so-me fame,
personal glory, and a bowl of
clam chowder.

“It’s something that I"ve al-
ways wanted to do,” explained
Gerson, a former Pitt harrier.
“I’ve done crazy things before,
and I am certainly going to ac-
complish this one.”

Besides the bowl of clam chow-
der which each runner gets after
the meet, Gerson has set two per-
sonal goals.

“I want to cover the 26 miles
385 yards in less than four hours
and get a certificate. Second, I
want to beat as many people as
I can," he said.

Jeff has been practicing for the
marathon since the beginning of
the semester and feels very op-
timistic about his performance.

“Even though I have never ran
that distance before-, I am very
confident that I’ll finish the race.

‘\\V

members were 179, Chris Fite;

174, Rick Sternberg; 172, Butch

Luick; and 172, Tom Smith. Stern-
berg rolled the high individual
game of 232 while Fite’s 609 was
the high three-game series for the
season.

Tomorrow the bowlers will be
rolling in an intercollegiate tour-
nament at Airport Lanes._ The
tournament consists of a team
event, ‘and a singles event. The
bowlers will be out to compen-"

1 sate for .a disappointing season.

  

JEFF GERSON
Enters Boston Marathon
“I’ve been running at the Field
House since January mostly com-
centrating on my speed work by
running three or four miles worth
of 220's,” he continues. “Today
I expect to star daily work outs

 

Take Thinclads Crown

Delta Sigma Phi and Kappa Sigma took top honors
in the fraternity track and field meet Wednesday after-

noon in the Field House.

Delta Sig racked up 501/; points to outdistance second

place Delta Tau Delta by 15 points in the league “A” meet. 5

Phi Kappa Theta finished third with 30 points, followed by Sigma
Chi (21), Zeta Beta‘Tau (20), Phi Epsilon Pi (10), Pi Lambda Pi (5)

and Sigma Alpha Mu (.2).

In league “B,” Kappa Sig too-k first place in six of the nine events
to amass 61 points. Phi Gamma Delta was a distant second with 36
markers, followed by Sigma Alpha Epsilon (31), Pi Kappa Alpha (18),
Theta Chi (16) and Lambda Sigma Rho (10).

Delta Sig picked up its margin
of victory in the two relay events,
copping first place in both with
record breaking times. The mile
medley team of Denny Ferris,

on the streets of Oakland, run-
ning about 10 miles a day.”

Gerson feels that in order to
cover the 26 miles he must over-
come a mental barrier and not a
physical one.

“I’m not going to run 26 miles
before the race, because I don’t
want to ‘psych’ myself out before
the marathon. I know that I can
cover the distance.”

Having read up on past mara-
thon runners, Jeff has formulized
his race strategy. “I’ll try to set
my own pace and attempt not to
worry about any of the other 700
racers in the field.”

Four hours after the starter’s
gun has fired, Jeff Gerson hopes
to be sitting down with a hot bowl
of chowder in one hand and a cer-

tificate in the other, just thinking ‘

of that long, restful vacation

ahead of him and the triumph be-»

hind him.

Hawks Announce Banquet,

WillAwardPookumTrophv

Due to the overwhelming
amount of requests from
alumni, the Pitt News Hawks
have announced they will hold
an All-Hawks banquet next Tues-
day at Gustine"s.

“We owe ourselves a pat on the
back for the wonderful job we’ve
done on the playing fields,” said
banquet coordinator Hobie “War-

I monger” Harris.

The Hawks finalized their plans
for a post-season banquet only
after they completed an undefeat-
ed basketball season and only af-
ter Mike “Hawk” Brourman
agreed to pay for the drinks.

“I don’t drink myself," chirped -
the Hawk, ‘.‘so I fig'.ured.I’d cre-

  

P -----will be shown,

ate some good will among the
others.”

“The only way he could create
some good will,” challenged Jer-
ry “LeRoy” Gruebel, “would be

to take a bath. Besides, Hawk's"

just after the first annual Peter
Pookum Award for athletic in-
feriority. I’ll tell you, those Sam
Huff Fair Play Awards just went
to his head.”

Reportedly. Tom “Alabama"
Sacks is flying in to deliver the
Keynote address for the banquet.
If Sacks can't make it, then high-

Charlie Mross, Polk and Gates
finished in 4:01, breaking the old
record of 4:04.4 set by Phi Gam-
ma Delta in 1966.

The 440-yard relay team of Joe
McCain, George Pribish, Jeff
Barr ‘and Ferris finished in 49.2
seconds. The old record for the
indoor race was 50.1 seconds, set "
by Phi Epsilon Pi in 1963.

Other record-breaking perform-
ances in the meet were turned
in for the mile run, 220 yard
dash and shot put. Schaas (Delta
Tau Delta) ran the mile in 4:46.8,
clipping 3.2 seconds‘ off the old
record. Smith (Delta Tau Delta)
turned in a 24.8 performance in
the 220, bettering the old mark
by .3 seconds. Sigma Chi’s Jeff
Brown broke the shot put record
with a toss of 44’1/é”. The old
record was 43’11A2”.

Rounding out the winners in
the “A” meet were Mike Patch-
er (Delta Sigma Phi) in the high
jump, Schiding (Delta Tau Delta)
in the running broad jump, Char-
lie Thompson (Phi Kappa Theta)
in the 50-yard low hurdles and
Denny Ferris (Delta Sig) in the
50-yard dash.

broad jump, high jump, 220 yard
dash, mile, 50-yard dash and 440-
yard relay in the “B” meet.

Joe Diederich paced the win-
ners in both the 50-yard dash and
220-yard dash. He also ran a leg
of the 440 relay, along with Dave
Koziel, Rich DiFillippo and Chuck
Reinsel.

John Burby won the mile for
the Kappa Sig’s in 5:18, barely
edging Joe Wendler (SAE) who
finished in 5218.1. Bill Green
won the high jump with a leap of
5’4” and Briston took the broad
jump with a 18’.

Non-Kappa Sig winners includ-
ed Steve Demase (SAE) in the
shot put with a toss of 32’41/Q";
Joe Malanowski (SAE) in the 50-
yard hurdles with a time of 7.2
seconds and Pi Kappa Alpha in '0
