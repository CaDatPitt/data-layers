Fights lngpainf
Raven Wounded
Aiding -Loyalist Forces

A University student who dreamed.

and thought he saw a- world-wide
proletarian revolution for the future,
has given his eyesight for what he
believes is an a.id to the‘ cause, par-
ticularly an aid to defeat the growth
of fascism. V .
Up behind the Morata front‘ in
shell-rocked Madrid, J. Robert Raven
lies on a hospital cot, with blinded
eyes and grenade-torn legs. I
Raven, who was injured while
taking part in a Loyalist bombing
raid on a trench heldby Rebel mili-
tiamen, was a student here from
1930 to 1934. Although no one
knows deﬁnitely how long he ..has
been ﬁghting for the Spanish Loyal-

ist cause, friends at the Unive_rsity be-

lieve he has been in Spain for at
least eight months.

The story of Raven has reached

the American press through a dis-
patch from Ernest Hemingway, writ-
ing‘ for the North A_mericanj News-J
paper Alliance, who talked with the
injured American -in Madrid.
" “How are things in America?
What do they think of us over
there?” Hemingway has reported
that Raven asked.

Hemingway Comments

When told that “sentiment has
changed a lot” and that “they are
beginning to realize the government
is going to win this war” Heming-
way reported that Raven responded:

“I’m awfully glad. You know, I
wouldn't mind any of this if I could
just watch what was going on. I
don’t mind the pain, you know. It
never" seemed important-, really. But
I was always awfully interested, in
tliingsvand I really wouldn’t-—mind- the
pain at all if I could just sort of
follow things , intelligently.

“I could even be of some use. You
know, I didn’t mind the war at all.
I did all right in the war. I got hit
once before, and I"-was back and re-
joined the battalion in two weeks. I
couldn’t stand to be away. Then I
got this.”

While at the University, Raven
limited his interest in the proletariat
cause to letter-writing to The Pitt
News in wliielrhc attacked a.colum-

nist, who favored revolution by a .

party other than the:Communist, as
a. "‘tea-time radical” and a “parlour
bolshevik.” —« ~

Although Raven was a consistent
“A” student at,the University, ﬁnan-
cial conditions made it impossible for
him to secure his final ten credits for
graduation. For three years he sup-
ported himself and two »b_roth_ers by
working 79 hours per week at the
Monteﬁore Hospital besides carrying
a full-timeeacademic schedule.

Hall Of Fame Ceremony Recognizes 20

During the past hour, predictions of extra-curricula.r lionors
at the University have gone with the wind and the expected has
made way for the unexpected in a who’s who that fooled and sur-
prised everyone from the lowly student in a distant end-zone seat
inn box seal, on the 50-yard line.

Locl<hart Leads Annual

ROTC andConccrt  
In 15th Annual Program

Reviewer Likes Rendition Ot ‘Headlines,’

Shirley's Trombone

Solo. Praises

Readings Ot Debussy Numbers

By ROBERT BROWN.

Exact
the stage of
versity ROTC -
swiiiig into its Seth home
John Philip Sousa.

In line with its policy of present-
ing every conceivable type of number
in its program, the selections ranged
from one of J. S. Bach’s great organ
fugues, transcribed for concert band",
to the Number One tune of the cur-

rent hit parade a few months back, _

i“I’ennies From Heaven.”

The band, paced through its pro-
gram under Mr. Lockhart, was at its
best in Carlton Colby’s heavily-synco-
phized “Headlines.” This is one of
the really good “human interest”
numbers in modern band literature.
Endowed wi'th a splendid brass sec-
tion, the organization built up strong
climaxes and brought out the weird
nostalgia. of the music in such a man-'
ner that the only thing missing was
the smell of printer’s ink, and was
warmly applauded by ‘the audience.

Shirley Skillful

The worst thing one can say about
John Shirley’s trombone solo is that
it has a terrible name 4- “Atlantic
Zephyrs.” It is a good number for
trombone, and; Shirley, with warm,
rich toneand sure command of his in-
stru_ment,—.along with skillful band ac-
companiment, gave it a good read-
ing. , - . _ ,

Later on the program, Messrs. ‘Shir-
ley, Hager, Patterson, and Haughton
played a trombone quartet arrange-
ment of Colby’s, “Allegro con Brio,”
and added “Pennies From Heaven”
to the accompaniment of a generous
silver offering from interested listen-
ers in the audience.

Less satisfying was the Bach num-
ber. It trips up all but the best of
organists and symphony orchestras, so

" the bandsinen can hardly be blamed

for not doing their best work on it.
iThe introduction was well done, but
the fugue was ragged in spots, and
it was only in the last few bars that
the wonderful sonority of the piece
became evident. The two Debussy
_numbers, “The Girl With the Flaxen
Hair,” and “The Golliwog’s Cake
Walk” were given better readings.

Shows Improvement

On the»whole, the band has im-
proved greatly since last year, and in
most of the concert, justiﬁed ‘their
reputation for being the outstanding
college band in the East. Mr. Lock-
hart has improved the technical abili-
ties of theplayers, and has worked
the hand up into a coordinating unit.
The group has several outstanding
i_iiembe1's who give it added Strength;
Shirley on trombone, Toerge on ﬂute,
Beal on bassoon, and Mr. Tracy on
percussion instruments, being but a‘
few. -

The concert ended with the band

‘playing famous college songs and
marches, with an arrangement of
“The Star Spangled Banner,” by Mr.
Lockhart.

Dental Instructors Convene

Seven members of the faculty of
the school of dentistry will present
papers ‘before the annual meeting of
the Pennsylvania Dental Society be-
ing held here next Tuesday, Wednes-

" day, and Thursday.

Those attending include Dr. E. G.

lrish, Pitt To Battle
Again-.--This Time

9 ‘ - -s.
It s  
Olson;Can't'.See' How.
_ Panthers Can Win, H
Bu} lsloferee Dame Worries
:  ' By LEN LEVISON V

This is getting to be a_ habit
writing about Pitt and
Notre _Dame. They’re at it
again. This time’ it’s a ‘track
meet. Tomorrow afternoon, out
in old’ Olson 'tei:ritory,- the -Panthers
will meet the Irish on the cinder-s -of
the Notre Dame -Stadium.
Tomorr_ow’s, get-together will be
the fourth bit of "athletic competition
between :the two_ schools this year.
The Panthers have -the upper hand
thus "far. They li"aiided"Notre Dame
a thorough gridiron‘ beating and split
the two-game basketball ‘series.-'

Rate Equally

Both teams are about of tliesanie
caliber on paper.‘The meet will be
one of those affairs that is decided
by just how much better than ex-
pected a few men perform. ‘

If any advantage ts g‘lV£11:_1t be‘
longs to Pitt. This is according to
the publicity departments of both
schools. From South Bend, the Irish
"send word that all they can do is
hope to make a good "showing. Frank
Carver, who handles the Pitt athletic
press releases, admits a Pitt victory,
but by a margin that will be very,
very small. “ V
' Coach Carl Olson of the Pitt
{trackers is inclined a different way.
He can't see anything but :1 Notre

;Dame» triumph. This may be over-
looked "as the typical coach’s condi—.

tion of worry. But Olsonlis not feel-
ing happy these days.
Pitt Runners’ Lend" _

Pitt’s strong line-up “of runners’
‘should do well in piling up points in
_the track events. Mason in the
sprints, Thomas in the quarter mile,

“and Woodruff in the half and mile
‘races. Olson wanted to run his Olym-
pic c-hampioii in three events, insur-
ling three firsts, but the Notre Dame

order of events would ‘not permit

that.

Notre Dame has two good sprint-
ers in Captain Bucky Jordan and

Bill Cliﬁ’-ord. They will make the,

running fast for Dick Maso'n‘.=»Eddie
Spitz, senior Pitt sprinter who ﬁn-
ished second to Peacock in the Pitt-

‘Temple meet“and‘ who-has been-run-

ning sensationally this spring, was

‘injured -in the Penn Relays and may

not be available for competition to-
morrow. ‘
Johnny Woodruif will have to run
_a' better mile than he hasrun this
season if he is to win tomorrow.
He'll be running against Gregg Rice,

fa 4:16 miler. Harold Tost, who set

a new Uiiiversity record in the two-

‘mile run against Temple two weeks
‘ago, will be running against Gene

Gormley. This should be another fea-
ture event.‘ Tost has what is known
in the locker room as “guts,” and if
he. is able to stay with Gormley up to
the last lap, he “will win. Gormley
runs the distance in 9 :38.

Field Events to Irish
it Field events have a distinct Notre

Dame ﬂavor. -,The I_rish will sweep.
the discus shot put, and hammer.

This counts up to 27 points. It will
go a long way in deciding the ﬁnal
outcome.

Olson left this morning with his
squad. Included were Spitz, Mason,
Thomas, Cooper, Routch, Zolnoski,
Leggin, Kopcc, Woodruﬂ’, Tost, Cook,
Zamborski, Ryden, Lasky, Bennett,
Oden, Radvansky, Garcia, Dines,

KClifton, and Gerrety.

The freshman track team will
meet Kiski in a_me-et at the Stadium
tomorrow afternoon. . Participating
will be the members of the Penn Re-
lay championship team,——Ohl, Fer-
rara, Lewis, and McKee. They will

- be stro_ng'ly support-ed by Johnny

Bazyk, the best weight man to come
to Pitt in years. Olson "can hardly
wait for this weight man to reach
his sophoniority so that he will be
ready for varsity competition.

_ Golf Team Plays_ Tech

At Field Club Tomorrow

. Rained out of their match with
Waynesburg Wednesday, the Pi-tt
golfers will come back into action
tomorrow afternoon in a match with
the Carnegie Tech Tartans at the
Pittsburgh Field Club.

Strongly favored to win, Pitt will
be trying to score its third straight
shut-out victory_and strengthen an
already granted district supremacy.

Tennis Teamd I
Meets Dukes’
On.Asphalt Today

Pitt’s"varsity' tennis team, rated ‘as
one of the strongest agg'regati'ons to
carry the Gold’ and Blue on the ten-
nis"courts,'wi_ll t_a_ngle'.'witli the Du-
que_s'ne_ ne'tmen_ on asphalt courts‘ at
the Bluff today, in its second dual
match of the season.  .-

Though the Bluffmen were coni-
pletely subjugated last April by way
of a 9-0, defeat in which_ they copped
only one ofthe nineteen sets played,
things ‘.will be tougher for the .Pan-
thers this season. The raiiis which
have played havoc with the scheduled
Pitt practise sessions have not been
so great a hindrance to the Dukes,

since their courts are asphalt. Also.

the courts will be much faster than
the clay courts Pitt has. played on
so far. i "

Practise On Bluff

The Panther netters practised
Wednesday "and. Thursday on the
Bluff for their only practises of the
week. The lineup Coach Dav-e
O’Loughlin will use against Duquesne

_ will be identical with last Friday’s
‘lineup against Grove City.

Bob Madden will head the list at
the number one position, with Ralph

Bald, Johnny Mogan, Irv Solow,"

Larry B_latt and Ad Hartman follow-
ing in order. The doubles teams are
Madden and Bald, Morgan and Solow,

. and Blatt and Hartinaii.

Pitt’s freshman tennis team has
not postpoiied the match with Tech
on Saturday, and the frosh are hur-
riedly preparing for their debut. All
frosh candidates must be at t.he Sta-
dium courts today at 10:45, for the
meeting which will determine who
will participate against the Tartan
yea.rlings tomorrow.

The freshmen will probably be
paced -by _Joe'..K'ristufek, city public
courts champion, in their opener. _

The varsity travels to Bethany for
its. third slated match of the sea-
son tomorrow.

Blackburn. Lawlor Meet
Mushball Sit-Down'Wii'h
' ‘ Customary Aplomb

By IRV BENNETT

It was noon la.st Saturday when
Jim Blackburn and Johnny Lawlor
set out from_.the Cathedral for the
_T1-e-es _ ﬁeld where a’_ﬁrst-year law
school mushball team was opposing
‘a’ second-year team. -

alt. was some time later that Jim
Blackburn and Johnny Lawlorcalled
for a taxi; they couldn’t ﬁnd Trees
ﬁeld. It was already the third inning
when Blackburn and Lawlor arrived
in their taxi '..at the Trees field’. The
score still stoodsclose. , -- .-

Jim Blackburn,» manager: of -the
second-year team,- hurrieclly consid-
ered his line-up, “I will go in,” he
told his team. But there were nine
men already, they ‘said. “That"s all
right,” said Jim, “thereis "a new rule
that there shall’ be ten men on-' a
musli_ball,t_eam, and Iain a utility
_ﬁ'elde_.r..” ‘Johiiny’ Lawlor"retii‘ed to
the bench ‘to ‘guide his team.

-' The - next inning, ‘- J_i-m Blackburn
made another new rule. He would -be
the ﬁrst man -up I «every inning.
Pitcher Milton Margolis a-nd _catcher

came in. .Bla-ckb-urn tapped the plate
with h-isf bat, reacly for action,_-de-
spite‘ the fact that he had just come

advised--.. Blackburn iwas Equity,

_  As  Bl'ackb.ur‘n smashed‘ out the
pitched ball, the "whole team in the
field _ sat "down. “-‘Sit-down ' strike
against Equity,”_ they declared. For
seven innings." the "sit-down against
Jim --Blackburn con-tinued, and he
-garnered liiniself ‘a triple each time.

However, with the aid of u«nipire
