By BILL

RIMMEL .

After 23 days of speculation, Athletic Director Tom
Hamilton told a press conference in his Field House oiﬁce
Monday, ‘‘It gives me great pleasure to introduce the new

head football coach at Pitt, John P. Michelosen.”

Although contract terms were not disclosed it was learn-
ed that present backﬁeld coach Michelosen was signed .to a

three-year contract.

Coach Michelosen said~that he would retain the use
of the Split T formation and would only use the single
wing‘, which he learned under 9 . .

the former Pitt great, Jock Suth-
erland, if the material at hand
proves suitable to a limited use
of that formation. 

Michelosen said 5‘I will do my
very best to ﬁeld a team well wor-
thy of a ﬁne university like the
University of Pittsburgh.”

Hamilton replied that he “felt
conﬁdent that the followers of the
team would be pleased and that
Michelosen was the best man for
the job.?’.

New Assistants Planned

When quizzed about the new as-
sistants, Michelosen replied that
he hadn’t had time to think about
it as yet and that everything was
still “up in the air.” He said, How-
ever, _that he would retain all the
present coaclies inxsome capacity.

He also said that he would need at -

least two new assistant coaches.
One, a backﬁeld coach to replace
Bob»Friedlund and a new line
coach to replace Bill Bevan. There

‘is also the possibility that a new

defensive coach will lbeadded to
the roster, but that is yet to be
decided.

When asked how he felt about
Michelosen’s appointment as the
new “head coach, Captain Ham-
ilton gave the expected reply:
“I got what I wanted and I am
very pleased,” he said.

The athletic committee met on
Saturday, decided on Michelosen,
informed the Chancellor, and he
got the appointment c l e a r e d

through the Board of Trustees-

'Monday morning.

The‘ announcement was made
ﬁrst to Michelosen and then to the
football team at lunch Monday.
The news »was made public at a
press conference soon afterwards.
After the formal press conference,
Captain Hamilton said, “he’s got ,a
good bunch of guys and I don’t see
how things could be better.”

Michelosen Experienced

Michelosen, who came to Pitt

after starring on both the football

- and basketball teams at Ambridge

High School, played freshmen ball

‘in 1934 and then moved to the var-

sity in .1935. He became the start-

ing quarterback immediately.
During his first season the Pitts
ended with a 6-1-2 record. The
next year was even better when
the season’s slate showed 8-1:-1.
That year, 1936, Pitt was selected
to play in the Rose Bowl‘ and on
Jan. 1, 1937, they defeated the
University of Washington.

During Michelosen’s senior
year he led the Panthers to an
undefeated season and was
named honorary captain at the
end of the year. In 1938, Mich-”*
elosen’s coaching career began
when he became an assistant to
Jock Sutherland.

In 1940 he followed Sutherland
to the Brooklyn Dodgers of the
National Football League where. he
became backﬁeld "coach. After the
1941 season he joined the, Navy
'and served for three years. Dur-
ing this, time he coached at Iowa

Pitt Players Don’t Always Play»

Shownhy Look Behind Scenes

By BETTY SKENDER

Tomorow night»Pitt Players will
present their second production
of the season, “The Great Big
Doorstep,” which will play
through Saturday night. Have you
ever wondered, though, what
work goes into the production of
a Pitt Play or how and when
shows are chosen?

Work ﬁrst begins with Director

Harvey Pope. Among his many 3

jobs is the choosing of Players’
productions. Plays are chosen in
the spring of the previous year by
Mr. Pope with suggestions from
staff, faculty, theater patrons, and
student members.

' Plays Grouped by Fours

-Plays are always picked in
groups of four and form the sea-
son’s bill. These four shows are
included in a four year cycle of
shows," so that during the four
year period, all styles of plays
are offered such as comedy, trag-
edy, romance, Shakespearean and
Greek drama.

‘In choosing the season’s bill,

. many factors are involved. Bal-

ancing the budget of sets and

E — costumes is most important. An-

other factor is the length of play
for effective production. A third
is the capability of students to be
cast.
Casting Competitive
Cast for plays are c h o s en
through competitive t r y o u t s.
Every undergraduate student is
eligible for the parts in a produc-
tion. When roles are cast, the

- actual work begins. The director

spends between 60 and 80 hours-
analyzing each- character so that
they may be fully understoodby
both players and audience. Then
the ‘cast as a whole spends from
three and a half to four weeks re-
heasing.‘ ’ .

One play costs no more than
$800. Rental of Stephen Foster
Memorial is-$100 and royalties,
$100. The -rest of the money is
spent on publicity and materials
for sets, such as papier-mache.
lumber, nails, furniture repairs,
and lighting.

Pitt Players members _are stu-
dent volunteers who expect noth-
ing in return for their service.

According to director" Pope, “each .

gains an opportunity to improve
his character, make new friends,
receive expertytraining of faculty,

Crew Builds Hills

Set is the latge responsibility of
Lloyd W. Welden, technical direc-
“Plays are written about
everything and every period of
time; it is our job as the stage
crew to obtain these necessities,”
said Welden. When the play calls
fora back-river shanty, as it does
in “The Great Big Doorstep,” the
crew must build it. If the set calls
for hills, the crew simulates them
with papier-mache. I

Assembling of stage sets
must be done within three
weeks of a performance. Crew
also have the responsibility of
lighting, sound effects, proper-
ties, and scenery.

Although there are many weeks
of hard work put into a Pitt Play-
ers production, few people seem
to appreciate it. The total number
of patrons during the three-day
‘run of a play has never exceeded
755.

Grippe and Cripes

By Jim Deweese

A few thoughts on the University of Pitts-
burgh. It is 535 ‘feet tall, the tallest school in the
United States and one of the tallest buildings. Why?
Several reasons, one of the foremost being that
any vantage point above the twelfth floor gives a
fair View of Forbes Field. W

Pitt has one of the best marching bands in the
nation but no ﬁeld at which they
may practice their routines: Prob-
ably because someone started the
rumor that Director Robert Ar-
thur likes to ride buses.

Heinz Chapel, located within
convenient walking distance from
the Cathedral, is one of the most
beautiful and costly buildings of
its kind in the world. And one‘
of the least attended. _

be in publications, drama, or

sion is a mature approach, for it
recognizes that women have
learned, to some extent, to con-
trol both academic and extra
curricula to achieve proper equili-

Actually the FPA, located on
the eleventh floor of the Cathe-

minded people in the Pittsburgh
area who have been organized to
promote “adult education in world

i affairs.”

Higgins guides the work of the
entire city association. He is as-
sisted by Anne Retterer the only
other full-time employee.

The FPA was founded, 25 years

One important activity oi:',FPA
is its being linked with the Univer-
sity-foreign,» students. The pro- .
grams also consists of a miniature
forum for high school students, an
annual" Pittsburgh world affairs
7 forum, and discussion groups for

both men and women.

“Pittsburgh is one ‘of the big

centers for foreign students.
Pitt and Tech are leading col-
leges in the country in the num-
ber of foreign students,” Hig-
gins emphasized. He said al-
though Pittsburghers don’t real-
ize it, this is a good propaganda
tool for showing foreigners how
goodwe are. ~ « .
FPA works with foreign stu-
dents from all five city‘ colleges—-

get as much out of their educa-
tion as possible,” Higgins said.

Students Speak
This year’s definite project of
getting foreign students out into
the community has been under-
taken by the Foreign Student
Committee of FPA. The members
have sent out material and are
making arangements for students
from abroad to give speeches to
community clubs and organiza-
tions. The committee also helped
with the annual reception for for-
eignstudents given at PCW.
Another of the nine commit-,
tees of FPA is working on the
‘world affairs forum for next
May. This forum, which is held
in a downtown hotel, always
draws a large crowd. It pre-
sents prominent \ speakers in

is stressed, members are not

The ’ Program -

THE OPEFATOR

On every American campus there are four standard ﬁxtures:

‘ No. 1 -— ivy; -No. 2 - a statue of the founder; No. 3 — Philip Morris

Cigarettes; No. 4 —- The Operator. ,

The ivy is to prevent strangers from mistaking the college for
a warehouse. The statue of the founder provides shade for necking
when the weather is ﬁne. The Philip Morris Cigarettes are an aid

to concentration when you are studious, an aid to sociability when -i

you are sportive, and a source of smoke’, rings to impress new girls
. . . And The Operatoris the man you can’t do without.
Well do I remember The Operator on my campus. He was a young

- man with a ready smile, a. quick mind, ﬁfteen complete changes. of

wardrobe, 9. six room apartment, 9. red convertible, and assorted A

, "stocks, bonds, securities, and second mortgages.

The Operator’s origins were a source of lively speculation. Some
said he was left over from the old Capone gang. Some said he was ,
Judge Crater. Some said he sprang from the brow of Zeus.

But, in fact, he was just an ordinary, student - to begin with. In‘
his ﬁrst year he studied hard, took copious lecture notes, got good
grades, and made a big reputation as a friend in need. He’d lend
you money; he’d let you copy his lecture notes; he’d write themes ‘
for you; hefd sit up all night to help you cram for an exam. All of
this was done with inﬁnite good nature on his part, and no obligation
on yours . . . The first year, that is. ‘

In the second year The Operator started to operate. He’d still let.
you copy his lecture notes - but it cost you a quarter. Sitting up to
help you cram cost.50 cents an hour till midnight, 75 cents an hour‘
afterwards. His prices for writing themes were based on a sliding
scale -— a dollar for a “C”, two for a “B”, three for an “A”. A “D”
cost you nothing, and if you ﬂunked, you got; a dollar credit on the
next theme he wrote for you. ', , A

His services expanded steadily. He added a line of cribs for
examinations. He booked bets on football games. He did a bit of
bootlegging. He ran a date bureau. He rented cars, tuxedos, non-wilt-
ing boutonnieres. , ,

But all of these were really sidelines. His main line was lending
money. At any hour of the day or night, for any amount from a dollar
to a hundred, The Operator was always ready with a sympathetic
ear and cash on the barre1head._And he rarely charged more the-'

, 150 percent interest. .

H Usury and sharp trading are practices not calculated to V.-

affection. Nobody loved The Operator. But nobody did anything
about it either . . . Because undergraduates live in a perpetual state
of need-—need of money, need of lecture notes, need of romance,
need of beer, need of something—and The Operator’ was the goose
that laid the golden eggs and, -therefore, safe. _

Nor did The Operator seek affection. .He just went his well-
heeled way, serene and carefree . . . No, not quite carefree. One
thing troubled him: a fear that some day he might graduate. Gradu-
ation, leaving school, would mean the _end of his empire..You_ can t _
run a business like that from the outside; you must be right in the
midst of things, spotting opportunities, anticipating needs, keeping
your ﬁnger on the public pulse. a

So he took great pains to stay in school, but_ never to graduate.
This he accomplished by-constantly shifting ma3ors. He would come
within a semester of getting a B.A. in sociology and then transfer
to law. When-he had nearly enough 1aw_ credits, he’d switch to
business administration. Then from business‘ admin1strati_o;ri to
psychology, from psychology to French, from French to history,
and so on, meanwhile getting cultured as all ‘get-out, rich as Croesus,
and never accumulating quite enough credits for a degree. ‘ .

Finally, of 'course,tit caught up with him. There came a semester
when no matter what he took, he had to wind up with some kind of
a degree. He looked frantically through the class schedule trying to
ﬁnd some major he hadn’t tried yet. And he found ‘one-physical
education. So, sleek and pudgy though he was from high living, The
Operator entered the department of physical ed. ' ' V

It was a mistake. Among the people he had to wrestle and box
with were some great hulking fellows who, like everybody else on
campus, owed him money- '

Their tiny foreheads creased with glee as they regarded The .
0perator’s trembling little body; their massive biceps swelled joy-
ously; their ﬂexors rippled with delight. Rumblmg happily, they
fell upon him and covered him with lumps, the smallest of which
Would have taken ﬁrst prize in any lump contest you might name.

Confused and sick at heart, The Operator dragged his battered
members home. He -knew he had to get out of physical ed; his life
was forfeit if he did not. So, unhappily, he transferred to some other

Central Catholic, Taylor Al1der-
dice, and Shaler Junior High
Schools.

course, and the following June, a beaten man in his cap and gown,
received with lifeless hands a diploma and a bachelor of arts degree
and shambled out into the great world.

I don’t know what happened to The Operator after graduation.
It’s not a bad guess that he’s serving time in some pokey somewhere.
Or maybe he was lucky and went into the advertising business. If so,
he is surely a big man on Madison Avenue today. ‘

But, as I say, I don’t know what happened to him. But this I do
know: another Operator appeared on campus as soon as this one
left, and he in turn was replaced by another, and the process goes
on endlessly. _ . , _ ~

For as long as boy students like girl students better than going
to class, as long as parents cling to the delusion thatthe allowance
they had at college is suﬂicient for their children, as long. as blood
runs warm and cash runs short, there will be an Operator operating
on every campus everywhere. . . .

Collegiate Competition Begins
For Fres11men,Cagers Tonight

_ Rougher competition is in the ofﬁng when the Panther
freshman team meets ‘Carnegie Tech’s froshl tonight in the
Skibo gym at 6:30 in a preliminary contest to the» Pitt-Tech

varsity game. , ‘
After easily handling two non-
collegiate opponents, the. Panther
cubs -will be playing against
freshmen competition for the ﬁrst
time. The Frosh have already de-
feated Westinghouse Apprentice
and Johnstown Center by c‘om-
fortable margins but the Tech
quintet should provide the locals
with a stiffer test. '

The 94-80 victory over Johns-
town was the ﬁrst in eight years
for the Frosh on the Johnstown
court.‘ The extension school has
always been tough to beat .in
their back yard.

Leading the Pittites in scoring
again was Julius Peques, 6-3

Peques hit for 27 points in the
Johnstown game to go with the
20 he collected against Westing-
house. Chuck Hursh,, 6-4 forward
from Irwin, was second with 25.

Peques looms as the outstand-

forward from Tulsa, Oakla.~

ing product of the current fresh-

men team according to Coach Carl ‘

Peterson. The Oklahoman has a
variety of shots and can hit from
outside and under the boards.
Hursh, another promising fresh-
man, decided to do some shooting,

besides rebounding, and proved

C Tonite Concerns Coach

By GENE AROIVIATORIO

_Carnegie Tech on its home court’ isn’t a pushover for
anyone but it’s a good bet that Coach Bob Timmons would

A rather be playing the Tartans
’ team. ‘
Don’t get the idea, though, that Timmons is considering-

tonight than another Big Ten

tonight’s contest a breather——in fact, it’s an understatement

to say he’s worried.

The main ‘reason for the fur-
rowed brow isn’t because of any

V big stars the Skibomen have, be-

cause they don’t have any .._ at
least none to compare with Ohio
State’s Robin‘ Freeman or Michi-
gan’s Harvey Williams. ,
Floor Big Problem

What they do have though is a
scrappy team—-especially when
they play Pitt—- and a small floor.
This is the combination the Pan-
thers wil have to reckon with if
they hope to spoil an upset bid.

The small floor is the big prob- ,

lem as Timmons comments, “We
have to figure some way to open
them up on that floor so we can
get shots.”

Who Timmons is counting on
to sink those shots is not yet sure,
seeing as how the Blue and Gold
only made 26% of their ﬁeld" goal
tries against Michigan. _

_ Zimmovan Starts

Usually a dependable set shot
from the back court, junior Joe
Fenwick has failed to hit his stride
in either of the games thus far.

Another junior, 6-3 Frank‘ Zim-
movan, whom Timmons is count-
ing on to give the team more scor-
ing punch, returns to, the starting

\

five tonight afterfailing to start
against the Wolverines. The North
Union Xcager is a rough man under
the boards and »a fine defensive
player but his shooting eye has
been off of late.

With Fenwick and Zimmovan
failing to break into the scoring
column with any significance,
most of the offensive atack has
been left up to Captain Ed Pav-
lick. The 6-3 forward has tossed
in 58 points in two contests-hit-
ting on 20 of 41 ﬁeld goal at-
tempts. - A
Frank Paces Skibos

Pacing the Skibos will be Soph
Alan Frank who dumped in 18
points against Duquesne’s Dukes
Monday night in a losing effort.

' ‘As far as that goes, neither the
Panthers nor‘ the Tartans have
had much other than losing ef-

forts. The Tartans have wonajust

one game in three starts while the
Blue and Gold will be after their
first victory in three starts.

A glance at the series record

between these two schools should

put the minds of most Panther
followers at ease, though, since
the Pittites have copped 74 "games
while the Plaidmen have managed.
to nail down only 16 decisions.

i\Everyone Happy
With .Miche|osen

By DAVE MAZER

To say that Johnny Michelosen was happy Monday would

‘ Sports Editor _

be the understatement of the year. The new football coach
‘walked around the Field House smiling, shaking hands, greet-
ing, well-wishers, and just about acting like a fellow who
found his stockin.g overflowing on Christmas morn.

And oddly enough, everyone else in the athletic family
sprouted’ this joyous atmosphere and the Panther ‘winter
sports arena bristled with action.

Michelosen had only fo
that he had been selected

und out earlier in the day
by the“ athletic committee.

The press conference, which was called together hur-

riedly at noon, caught John

by surprise just as did the

newspaper and radio people. Good things that come
as a surprise bring. more joy than usual.
“I't’s alwaysbeen my goal to someday become coach
her. ,” was"Michelosen’s reply as to how he felt in receiving
the position. “I, owe a lot to the University and I hope I can

repay some of it with a winning team,” added the former

star quarterback of the Jock Sutherland 1935-37'elevens.

Mike had revealed at the
the Split. T and when asked

conference that he .,would.use

later if this meant that the .

multiple offense would be thrown out, he said “No” but that
he wanted “the boys to master one type of offense and if 11;

worked out well, maybe some
will be added.”

other things like the multiple

As to the well-known single wing that «he helped
make famous‘ as a Panther gridder and Pittsburgh Steel-
er’s coach, Mikesaid, “At the present time, there is no

single wing “planned.”

The assistant coaches discussion came up and while he

I admitted that there is a “possibility” that_ they might come

from the pro ranks, he, said that ‘he really hadn’t given it
much thought yet because everything had just happened so
fast that‘he’hadn’t had time to think about it." ‘

Concerning the popularity of the new mentor, it was
not hard to tell from the attitude of the other members of
the staff or the players that they approvedheartily.

’” The athletic committee, the last one to approve, 

ﬁnally selected a Pitt grad

after going along ‘with two

big name coaches, Len Casanova and Red Dawson, in their

last two choices;

Now, “as the people’s cherce,” Michelosen is on his

Sig, Chi Wins Bowl Playoff Too

A- veteran of the‘ interfraternity bowling , Wars and a’
,newcomer combined to give Phi Epsilon Pi a close 2-1 win
over Phi Gamma Delta in the quarter-ﬁnals Monday. Sigma

Chi bowled over Sigma Pi  three
straight games to also remain‘ in
title? contention.

The Phi Gams copped their first
match by a meager. 18-pin margin,
but _Phi Ep roared back, paced by
Lee 'Si1verm'an’s 1'77, to tie the se-
ries at one game apiece. This
match produced the season’s high
game for ‘both quintets, 735 and
660.

In the crucial third game, the

».Epers changed the lineup which
had carried them into the playoffs,
putting in'Earl Markowitz, a new-
comer. He responded by rolling a
168 to carry the Eps into to-
~morrow’s semi-ﬁnal battle with
Delta Tau Delta. ‘

Thus, the combination of Sil-
verman, the vet, and Markowitz,

the rookie, proved too much for
the losers. George Alcott and J irn' i

Howard V were standouts in the
losing cause. ‘
Sigma Chi had little trouble
with the Sig Pi’s who were bowl-
ing without their ace kegler, Bob
Martinelli. The Sig-> Chi’s bowled

a consistent series, rolling 563,.

562, and 567. ‘

The Chi lineup remained con-
stant, featuring Bill Furrer,. Jack
Kunkle, Bob ‘Wolf, Noel Wiard,
and Jerry Peairs. Kunkle, with a
119.7 average, and Furrer, with a
119.0 mark paced the Bayard
Street bowlers. ~
