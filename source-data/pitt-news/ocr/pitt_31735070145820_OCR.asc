After receiving thousands of
RSVPs and one stern warning

E from police, the creator of a
V SempleFest Facebook event re- '
i moved the post for the annual

block party. is
A notice for the event, whic

' traditionally occurs the last Fri-

day before ﬁnals week and his-

torically produces dozens of open
container violations and under-
age drinking citations, appeared
on Facebook earlier this week.
Before being removed from Fa-
cebook last night, the event had
about 2,800 people — most of
whom were Pitt students — con-
ﬁrming that they’ll attend.
Yesterday afternoon, city po-
lice Commander Kathryn Degler
called Dominic Depasquale, the

and 328 Semple St. properties —

SempleFest would occur. Degler
told‘Depasquale he would be re-‘
sponsible for any violations that
occurred on his property,‘ so
Depasquale warned his tenants
about hosting the event.

Degler said she also spoke to
one of the Semple Street resi-
dents, but wouldn’t say which

landlord who owns the 324, 326 —

where the Facebook event said 7

one. The resident asked her if
they could still have a party. De-
gler said she told the resident,
“Sure, you can have a party, but
I’ve been to your house, and it’s
not going to ﬁt 3,000 people.” She

‘said she told the tenant that he

would have_ to be 21 if he wanted
to serve alcohol.

“I told him that he should do
what he thought was best for his
future,” Degler said.

SempleFest Facebook event deleted

The Pitt News received a Fa-
cebook message last night from
the event’s listed creator — ﬁrst
name: Semple, last name: Fest —
saying, “semplefest is not happen-
ing at my house. this is crazy.”

Andrew Huang, a Pitt student
who lives at 324 Semple St., said
later last night that he created the
Facebook event for SempleFest by
himself. He said he doesn’t con-
sider h‘im_self a SempleFest orga-

SGB holds last meeting

Board passes two resolutions, hears two requests

Carla Trinca— Conley
Stajfwri ter

Student Government Board held its
lastmeetingofthe semesterinNordy’s
Place last night to acrowd of aboutﬁve
people.

The Board passed two resolutions
that it had introduced at last week’s
meeting.

The Collegiate Housing and Infra-
structure Act Resolutionwill allow the
Boardtowrite onbehalfofPitI students
in support of a federal legislation that
would allow nonproﬁt entities to do-
natetofratemities orsororities without
affecting the entities’ nonproﬁt status.
Previous legislation did not allow non—
proﬁtsto donateﬁmdsto sororities and
fraternities, forcing the organizations
to raise their own funds to ﬁx housing
safety issues.

The Public Advertising Resolution
willrequire every student organization

that receives allocations funds for ad- _

vertisingwill havetoprint out“paidfor
by the StudentActivity Fee and allocat-
edbythe Student Government Board”
on any of their advertisements.

Board member David Petrone said
the Public Advertisement Resolution
will “increase transparency and show
students where the money is coming
from.”

The Collegiate Housing and Infra-
structure Act Resolution will have the
Boardwrite onbehalfofPitt studentsin
supportoffederallegislationthatwould
allow nonproﬁt entitiesto donate tofra—
temities or sororitieswithout affecting
the entities’ nonproﬁt status.

Board President Charlie Shull said .

that after talking with Pitt govem-

mental relations administrators, the
resolution would not alfectthe entities’
nonproﬁt status.

Molly Stieber, Board member, said
she “really supported” the resolution
and hoped that advertisements would
bring students to Board meetings.

Shull said the current phrasing of
the resolution includes formula or-
ganizations, such as the Pitt Program
Council, to participate. Formula orga-
nizations do not go through the same

allocations process as other student ' A

groups — instead, they receive a set
portion of the student activity fee,
rather than going through the alloca-
tions process.

Board member Phil LaRue said
it was “essential” to include formula
groups because they receive the larg-
est share of money from the Student
Activities Fee. A

“The choices the PPC makes shoul
beunderpublic scrutinyjustas muchas
any other organization,” LaRue said.

Shull cautioned students planning
to participate in the upcoming Sem-
p1eFest —— an unofficial, armual block
party on Semple Streetthathashistori-
crillyresultedinstudentsbeingcitedfor
underage drinldngand open container
violations.

“Not to be a Debbie Downer,”
Shull said, but “be cognizant of your
actions.”

Shull reminded students that hav-
ing an open container of alcohol on
the street counts as an open container
violation, forwhich students couldface
ﬁnes. _

If students do not follow the com-
mands of the police officers, and do
something inappropriate, Shull said,
theywill be arrested.

An article in Monday’s edition, “Informal GPSA inauguration,” incorrectly listed the school a student attends. Kim Payne represents students in
the School of Medicine’s graduate program. An article in yesterday’s edition, “Urban ﬂea market opens in Strip District,” incorrectly named the
executive director of Neighbors in the Strip. Her name is Becky Rodgers. The Pitt News regrets the errors.

Student loans to
change this summer

Health care reform makes government the primary lender

Gwenn Barney
Staﬁ” Writer

Pitt students will have to change the Way
they apply for some loans after the recent
passage of health care reform legislation.

Beginning July 1, the government will
take over the distribution of student loans,
including the most popular Stafford Stu-
dent Loan.

For Pitt students, this change means
they will now need to complete an entrance
interview and sign a Master Promissory
Note — a contract stating that they will
pay back the Stafford Loan in full —— with
the U.S. Department of Education before
receiving their Stafford Loan. Both these
steps can be completed online at www.Stu—
dentLoans.—gov.

Before the change, private lenders and
banks held theﬁresponsibility for loan dis-
tribution. The government encouraged»
lenders to provide students with loans by
granting the lenders subsidies,

Suzanne McColloch, senior associate ~

director in the Ofﬁce of Admissions and
Financial Aid, said she thinks the change
will beneﬁt Pitt students. “The processing
will be more eﬂicient and less ‘confusing
because students and ﬁnancial aid offices
will be dealing with only one lender and one
guarantee agency — the U.S. Department
of Education,” she said.

This shift in control of student loans
is based on The Health Care and Educa-
tion Reconciliation Act of 2010 passed last
month. ,

Under the new policy, all undergraduate
students will be eligible for Stafford Loans
of at least $5,500 and up to $12,500. Gradu-
ate students are entitled to loans as high as
$20,500 per year. Also, the interest rate on
these loans will not exceed 6.8 percent per
year. Students considered to be “needy”
can be awardedlower interest rates by the
lender. The lender determines need based
mostly on the student’s FAFSA forms on a
case-by-case basis.

The Congressional Budget Ofﬁce esti-
mated the national treasury will gain $60
million over the next 10 years in taking
control of student loans. The government
aims to create more and larger Pell Grants
with the money saved by "eliminating the
subsidies on Stafford Loans.‘Pell Grants
are monies awarded to students with family
incomes below $45,000 a year that do not
need to be paid back.

McColloch encouraged students to
complete the necessary processes for the
Stafford Loans as soon as possible, even
if they are not sure they will need student
loan funds for future terms. She said there
will be no cost or penalty for applying if
the entrance interview and Master Prom-
issory Note are completed and a loan ‘is
awarded.

Jenelle Pifer
For The Pitt News

On the ﬁrst Friday night in April, Bob Ziller’s
Penn Avenue studio space smelled of paint and
sawdust. The large room was chilled and dimly
lit. Its center remained empty, but alongthe walls
gigantic ﬂowers bloomed under spotlights, grow-
ing more colorful by the minute.

' The ﬂowers have been growing since July,
when Ziller, an artist from Wilkinsburg, Pa.,
founded the Pittsburgh Beautiﬁcation Project.
Foryears, he keptaweary eye on run-downbuild-
ings throughout the city. '

He decided something had to be done. Last
July, on the boarded windows of an abandoned
uptown building near the Birmingham Bridge,

Ziller decided to paint a few ﬂowers.

After receiving wood panels, paint, a studio
space and funding, Ziller founded the community
development project seeking to uplift rundown
properties by revamping their exteriors. Since
then, he has placed hundreds of Andy Warhol-
inspiredﬂower murals, mostly painted by mem-
bers ofthe community, onmorethanadozen run-
down buildings throughout Pittsburgh. Students
cansee Ziller’s  Bridge projectas they
ride the bus from Oakland to Downtown.

“As an artist, you just have these impulses to i

make something,” Ziller said. “And it’s nice to
hear the feedback. I’ve only heard good things.”

After receiving supplies from the Sproutliimd,
anonproﬁt group that sponsors-grassroots com-
munity projects, Ziller quickly saw the project’s
potential to bring the community together. He

' beganto hold painting parties open to the public

on theﬁrstFriday night of each month. Between
50 and 100 people stoppedbyto help and painted '
up to 30 panels each time. .
Ziller’s project hibernated through the cold
winter months from SeptemberuntilApril, when
hisﬂowersonce againbegan to multiplyas apart

Mike Washil, avolunteerforthe Beautiﬁcation

always been diverse. -'

Families, artists and community members
regularly attend, along with anyone from the
gallery walk who happens to wander inside.

“We have toddlers and grandparents, people
of all ages and races. People get excited, because
it’s something they can actually participate in,”
Washil said.

The event earlier this month produced aﬂow-
er with rays like the sun and anotherinpale blue
that resembled a cloud. By the end of the night
there were splatter-painted petals and stripes of
pink and yellow. '

Ziller painted the ﬁrst set of ﬂowers lastjuly
insolid colors, takinghis cue directlyﬁ'omAndy

‘ Warhol’sfamous1964sill<screeni‘Flowers.”Sir1ce

then, he has yet to paint a single petal, work-
ing instead to add only the ﬁnishing touch -—- a
background of grass. He said there are so many
people willing to help, it all seems to run on re-
mote control. ‘

“All these little kids just go wild with paint
and patterns, so it’s really firm to see. It’s much
more creative than what I had done, so it’s pretty
humbling,” Ziller said. .

, Because of the visibility of the project and
word of mouth, community development groups
and local residents now actively seek Ziller’s help
to revitalize properties in their_areas.

Rob Levkulich, a South Side resident, installed
Ziller’s panels in a property he’s ﬁxing up in Pol-
ish Hill. V 1

“Everyone loved it,” Levkulich said. “It’s a
great intermediate step before we can get win-
dows.” r

Ziller originally chose the Warhol-inspired
pattern in homage to his ﬁrst ﬂowered building
in uptown near the Birmingham Bridge. After
a ﬁiend toldhim Andy Warhol was born in the
neighborhood, the choice was easy, he said.

To Ziller, Pittsburgh is a great city in which
to be an artist, and he said he hopes to continue
to honor local talent. Admiring the work of Hill
District artist Romare Bearden, he said he hopes
to translate his collage-like style to more murals
throughout the area. ‘

Zillerwillcontinue to hold open paintingpar—
ties the ﬁrst Friday night of every month in his
studio space, located at 4810 Penn Ave.

nizer because he didn’t walk up and down
the street asking people to participate.
Huang said he “just wanted to see what
kind of hype was around it,” and that he
thinks the Facebook event was “blown out
of proportion.”

On his own Facebook Wall, Huang wrote

_ “They call me Mr. fest.”

Huang, who said he is older than 21 but
declined to give his speciﬁc age, said he
probably won’t attend SempleFest because
he has to work Friday night. He said he
included his address as a party location
because, “I guess a lot of people wanted
to do something to celebrate, so I was just
the one who made the group.”

Hesaid he consulted with the people
living at 326 Semple St., who could not
be reached for comment yesterday, before
listing their address. _ '

He“said he did not speak directly with
the residents of the 328 Semple St. ‘proper-
ty but instead spoke to one of their friends,
who told him they wanted to participate
in SempleFest. Huang did not name the
friend he spoke to. _

Pitt students Jason Ruhl and Dheeren
Padhair, who live at 328 Semple St., said
they never planned to offer their house
for SempleFest and did not initially know
that their address was on the Facebook
even for the site. Their roommates, John
Full and Erik Haupt, did not respond to
requests for comment. -

Around 6:30 p.m. yesterday, the Fa’-
cebook event. for the party disappeared
from public view.

Party pooped

Pitt ofﬁcials went onto the event’s Fa-
cebook page yesterday to warn students
about participating in the event.

Shawn Ahearn, director of communica-
tions for Student Afl'airs,,posted a picture
of a large caution sign onthe site warning
students‘ to “Celebrate. Responsibly”. be-
cause University and city police would be
watching the event, which does not have
a permit from the city. ’ .

Student Conduct Ofﬁcer Deborah Walk-‘
er, who works with the University’s Judicial
Board, posted on the site warning its. at-
tendees that “University students that are
cited'by the city and/or University police
are subject to sanctions that may include
ﬁnes, restitution, disciplinary probation

T and disciplinary suspension.” or _
City and University oﬂicials said the ’

punishments for this year’s SempleFest,
should it occur, will be the same as last
year —— when ofﬁcials warned students
that they could also appear in court if they
were caught underage drinking, breaking
open container laws or failing to disperse
from Semple Street upon police request,
among other illegalactivities. ‘ '

student leaders but said he did not know

yesterday afternoon which students they

Pitt police Commander Kathy Schreiber

said additional police would patrol the_area

this weekend, but she declined toisay how
many extra officers would work.

Fedele explained why the University
prefers to keep its plans quiet.

“If we say we’re going to place police at
this corner, this corner and this corner,

‘somebody will show up at that corner,”

he said.
A Degler said police are “not going to tol-
erate?’ the behavior that occurred at past

SempleFests; during which many students
drank alcohol and some burned objects in
the street.

“I know the college kids think that they
own the whole street, but they do not,”
Degler said. “They are visitors in our town.
There are plenty of people who do not care
for drunks screaming and yelling in their
backyard.”

Cut the salt

t your next meal, don’t ask
anyone to pass the salt.

Studies have increasingly

shown that salt ranks among the .

worst culinary culprits when it
comes to our health. We need salt
to survive, but Americans’ daily
sodium intake has reached dan-
gerous levels.

Now, the Food and Drug Ad-
ministration plans to create fed-
eral standards to limit the amount

' of salt that food manufacturers

and restaurants can add to food,
the Washington Post reports. But
this is a large-scale health issue

that’s shown chronic concerns. -

We’re already in a pinch, and it’s
time that the FDA takes action.
The U.S. government recom-
mends around 2,400 milligrams
of sodium per day. However, most
American adults consume around
double the recommended daily
value, according to the Center
for Disease Control. One in three
Americans has high blood pres-
sure. Time reports that excess
sodium contributes to as many
as 150,000 premature deaths
each year and to $10 to $24 bil-
lion in health care costs. Sodium
increases blood volume because it
attracts and holds water, accord-
ing to the Mayo Clinic. With high.-
er blood volume, the heart must
work harder to pump blood.
But all this health hullabaloo
could fall on deaf ears to a group
that’s notoriously unconcerned
about health issues yet also no-
toriously unhealthy: college
students. College diets rely on
processed foods because those
foods are cheap and require little

preparation time amid a schedule ’

that’s crammed with classes. Col-

lege students also frequent res-
taurants and takeout food. And
in attempting to deter that pesky
freshman 15, sodium, content
could be overlooked in favor of
cutting calories, sugar and fat.
If college students and oth-
ers have heard of sodium’s health
detriments, but won’t make ac-
commodations in their diets, the
FDKS ensuing regulation becomes
all the more important. Ideally,
we’d all take responsibility for
our health, but realistically that’s

not the situation, Once again, it’s ‘

in college students’ nature to al-
ways reach for the convenient and
cheap hunger ﬁxes. Some might
immediately associate regulation
with nanny government, but in
this instance, knowledge of the
dangers of salt intake has been
in the news for several years and
we’re still having problems. FDA
intervention seems one of the
only viable solutions.
Consumers shouldn’t expect
to see sodium content percent-
ages on nutrition labels paring
down anytime soon, however.
The FDA’s massive overhaul is a
10-year program. The project will
take significant effort ‘on part of

the FDA —— they’ll have to analyze

thousands of products that make
up the $600 billion food industry.
The details of how they’ll pro-
ceed have yet to be released. Sure,
we’d all like to see this process
sped up since it is a real concern,
but because food manufacturers
can add as much salt that they

like to their products, the legal

limits will be an unprecedented
and massive change. Given the

long timetable, hopefully it’ll be

done right.

While many musicians are inlfa-4 V

mous for their tour escapades -
Ozzy Osbourne chomping a1,bat’s
head off onstage, Jim Morrison
pulling his pants down during a
performance — New York-based
singer—songwriter John Brodeur
has held to a policy of relative calm
during his shows — with a few ex-
ceptions. _

“I play this one song called ‘Dy-
ing For Me,”’ Brodeur said. “And
when Iwas singing it the other night
it came out as ‘diet for me.’ I felt
like I was performing the Weird Al
version of my own song.”

‘ “Oh, and I broke a string once,

too,” he added.

Brodeur’s current tour, sand-
wiched between the release of last
spring’s album Get Through and this

. summer’s upcoming Little Hopes,

brings his unique brand of punchy
power pop to venues all along the
East Coast. , g 1

. “Brodeur said the tour experi-
ence has allowed him to do a lot
of “networking with people who

‘ ,

attend the shows’.”. ‘ ‘

“It’s sort of like Twitter, but in I

real life,” he said,'laughing.
However, it’s not always a sunny
relationship between Brodeur and
his fans. The singer—songwriter said
retaining an audience is often the

most diﬂicult aspect of the profes— '

sion.

“Coming out of a city like New
York, it was really challenging to get
some momentum going,” he said.
“I’d love to be able to keep play-
ing there every week, but it’s just
tough to get people to keep com-
ing back because there’s so much

going on-” ‘ . . I

Brodeur said that when it comes
to building a career,'long-term plan-
ning goes a long way.

_ “There are some bands and art-
ists out there where it seems like
they started .out with this formula
for success in mind,” he said, citing
the Philadelphia quintet Dr. Dog as
a band that seemed to be “thinking
ﬁve  ahead.” ° j; A V;  . 

Tharlkfully, the struggle forfliis
own.succes"s has not stiﬂed; Bro-
deur’s passion for _his-jwork. ’

' “This is something‘ that I’ve
known that I wanted to do from a
very young age. Just listening to my
parents’ records, it was something
that I naturally gravitated to and felt
a really strong emotional connec-
tion with,” he said.

Of course, Brodeur’s styleshave .

evolved a great _deal from the time

he ﬁrst picked up an instrument.

In fashion, sunglasses. in shades of gray

Some clothing choices, like sunglasses and ‘sweatpants, carry different implications for different people, says Sam

Before I begin, please don’t laugh
at me. . '

I’ve harbored this weird obses-
sion with fake glasses for the past
year. I know they go against my
anti—hipster bent, but what can I
say? I want in on the cult.

It all began in London. While
studying abroad, I spent nearly
every Friday morning perusing
Portobello Market — a huge out-
door cluster of street vendors in
Notting Hill. At the market, there
was a sunglass stand owned by

this hilarious vendor who always
wore giant plastic clown glasses.
He’d help everyone ﬁgure out
exactly which pair they should
buy — throwing frames around
the tent and giving «customers a
thumbs up or a thumbs down.

$

Once, I put on a pair of square
fake glasses and peered into one
of the stand’s tiny mirrors. I loved
them, and I waved down the own-
er for a second opinion.

“No, no,” he said. “You look
too serious in those. You look like

So what would fake glasses

‘my doctor.”

“Oh,” I said. Reluctantly, I put
them down, bought a pair of huge
tortoiseshell sunglasses and tried
to forget about my craving for fake
specs. ‘ - ' ‘

I had all but given up.on my
dream of looking like a bookish
young coed until a few weeks

: ago, when I borrowed my friend

]ustin’s pair of plastic glasses for
a day. _

- Immediately, I became re-in-
fatuated and went out to buy a pair
for myself. But thus far, they’ve
been sitting on top of my dresser

‘with the price tag still attached

($6 at Forever 21, if anyone’s in-

terested). I’m chickening out —
I’m too afraid of people making
fun of me when I wear themf
Fashion, after _all, is the most

TV SHOW REVIEW

New season continues to spread ‘Glee

Kieran Layton
A&E Editor

“Glee”

Fox

Tuesdays, 9 p.m.

 Lea Michele, Cory
Monteith

Creator: Ryan Murphy
Grade: A

About a year ag , I received a
brightly colored DVD in the mail. The
packaging suggested it was a show
abouthigh schoolkids — really super-
happy high school kids. _

And on some level, that’s what
“Glee” is- ‘a show about high school
kids who are all so blithely unaware
of awful things like genocide and the
lack ofjobs for recentcollege graduates
that you can’t help but get a little glee-
ful afterwatching it. Of course, there’s
also the singing and dancing. And Sue
Sylvester.

Now that America (and the rest of
the world) has made the singing-and-
dancing sensation of a show into one
of themost unlikely hits of this year’s
television season, only one question
remains: Has it lived up to the hype?

The answer is unequivocally yes.

Fixing what was slightly amiss in
the pilot, amping up the energy and
the humor with each episode and in-
cluding some genuine heartfelt emo-
tional content, “Glee” is a feel—good
juggernaut, one that doesn’t seem to
be releasing its grasp_on the public
anytime soon. -

In the pilot, characters like Kurt
.and"sas_sy Mercedes came across as
archetypalsupporung roles. By now,
however, they -practically steal the
spotlightwith some ofthe show’s best
songs and subplots. The episode in
which Kurt comes out'_to his father?
Emmy worthy. Mercedes’ soloinv the

sleepers get too excited, these aren’t the
kind of ‘sweatpants with “PITT” screen-

‘printed down the leg. These are made of
cashmere or high quality jersey and cut to
look like much trendier pants.

The Cut’s article detailed how the trend ' -

started (with designers Alexander Wang
and Isabel Marant) before explaining its

paradox: To‘ the untrained eye, they look

sloppy and ridiculous, but to those in the
fashion know, they look ahead of the curve.

less apt to write humor into my songs than

Perhaps the biggest change for Brodeur
has been the shift from ensemble music to
solo work. i .

“I did the band thing for a while. I think

please every eye

the thing: Even if I did muster the courage
to buy a pair, I’d be worried about how other

ing someone would cast me one glance and

person who praises your bravery to rock»
something different, there’s going to be

someone who laughs hysterically at you the .

who’s worth listening to. ‘

said, laughing. “They’re too democratic, and ‘

I can’t deal with democracy.”

— the producers have proved that they know
how to keep the show interesting and varied,
so audiences don’t tire of any one charactertoo

a glimmer of humanity which no one thought

(she could possess. The scene where she 

her sister and reads to herwas possibly the most
unexpected teaﬁerker on television this year.
The issues that existed underthepilot’s surface
have been mostly smoothed over, if not elimi-
nated entirely. There are still times in any given
episode when the dialogue becomes too cheesy,
which is saying a lot because cheese and “Glee”
go together perfectly. ,
Some numbers also totally miss their mark

and head straight into Kidz Bop territory. :‘My

Still, even with its minor setbacks, “Glee” is
one of the best hours of television you can watch
during the week. And with the show just now

no bettertime to get happywith a song, adance

Berry Wants to Work with childrenafter NFL

The administration of justice major wants to work as a probation officer to help kids, but first hopes to make an NFL‘squad ‘" ‘

Brody Engelhard

For the Pitt News

Editor’s note: This is part six of
The Pitt News’ series of proﬁles
on the eight Panthers who are
entering the NFL Draft, which
takes place this weekend in New
York.

Pitt senior Aaron Berry wants
to help troubled youths.

That wasn’t his plan when he
wasgrowing up around Harris-
burg, until he found his guide

in the game of football. _Now’he '

wants to “help out kids and point
them in the right direction.” Es-
pecially kids without football.
He is an administration of
justice major, and he hopes that
becoming a'probation officer
will allow him to get kids back

- on track.

But ﬁrst, the cornerback hopes
to land a job with the NFL.

Berry is one of eight Panthers
entering this week’s NFL Draft,
which starts Thursday in New
York.

Audie Attar of Paradigm
Sports Management is Berry’s
agent goinginto next week’s
NFL Draft. He thinks Berry will
be an attractive prospect for

. many teams in the mid—to—later

rounds. . V

Berry himself said he believes
he’ll get drafted, but even‘ if he
doesn’t, he still thinks he’ll make
a team.

“I got a shot. The draft is cra-
zy, [but] as long asgl get a chance
to go to camp, I feel I can" make
the team,” he said. “I’ve been
playing football _my whole life.
I’m ‘ready for the opportunity and
to take advantage of it.”

Although he was not invited
to the NFL Combine this year,’
Berry has been working hard to
impress scouts with his speed,
reaction time and drive.

He participated in the East-
West Shrine Game, where he
most notably had a fumble re-
covery and improved his draft
stock.

Berry measured in at 5—foot—10
and 176 pounds when he ran the
40-yard dash at a time that was
reported to be between 4.3 and
4.4 at the Panthers’ Pro Day. He
benched 225 pounds 11 times,
had a vertical jump of 37 inches
and a broad jump of 10 feet and
3 inches.

Berry has been one of the
two starting cornerbacks for
the Panthers since the 2007
season, when he started the last
nine games. After lettering as a
freshman in 2006, he saw limited
time throughout 12 games. '

Berry went on to have a break-
out sophomore season, register-
ing a team-high two intercep-
tions, ﬁve pass breakups and 19
tackles. He also ranked third in
the Big East with a 8.6 yards per
punt return average that year.

In 2008, Berry completed 41

tackles, three interceptions, 10 -

pass breakups to lead the team,
a sack and a blocked ﬁeld goal.
He received 14 punt returns with
a 5.4 yards per punt return aver-

age. He was an all-Big East Sec- V

0nd Team selection.

In his senior season, Berry ‘

had 31 tackles, one interception
and was named to the all-Big East
First Team. ‘

Berry was a shutdown corner
that covered the likes of Notre
Dame’s Golden Tate and Cincin-
nati’s Mardy Gilyard throughout
the season, as well as North Caro-
lina’s Greg Little in the Meineke
Car Care Bowl. ~

Berry claims the Meineke Car
Care Bowl as one of his favorite
moments as a Pitt player. He is
proud to be on the ﬁrst 10-win

‘ team at Pitt since Dan Marino

led the Panthers in 1981 and to

have the first bowl win for coach I

Dave Wannstedt during his ten-
ure at Pitt. — l .
If Berry can make a team in
the NFL, he thinks he can con-
tribute right away. .

“I can help a team out any way
possible, on special teams, at cor-
ner, nickelback,” he said. “I feelI
can be a productive player.” '

Stevens hits record homer

Chris Neverman I STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER

This weekend, pitcher Alyssa O’Connell ear

Torie Wytiaz
Staff Writer

Softball head coach Holly'Aprile knew that her

freshman catcher had the potential to emerge as

a premier power hitter for the Panthers. Shejust
”didn’t know that it would happen so soon.

Holly Stevens recorded three homeruns in

a three—game series against Big East opponent

- St. John’s, bringing her season total to a team— .

high nine. The previous record for single-season
homeruns for a Pit rookie was six, set last year
‘byYvette Bravo. V

“When we recruited Stevens, we hoped that
she wouldbe amajor offensive contributor,’ ’Aprile
said. “I can’t say I am surprised with her perfor-

mance this weekend, but three homeruns was

certainly abit unexpected.”

Aprilealso notedthat Stevenshasconsistently
battedinthethirdspot ofthe lineup, apositionthat
Aprile looks to forrunproduction.

Stevens helped propel the Panthers (_22-17, 6-5
Big East) to two victories overthe Red Storm (16-
23, 5-8 Big East), both by a score of 7—2.'St. ]ohn’s

avoided the sweep by defeating the Panthers in a

While the Panthers could not generate offensive
production in the ﬁnal game, runs were easy to
come by in the previous two contests.

In the opening game, the Panthers came back
ﬁom an early2—o deﬁcit, thanks to Bravo’s two—run

“We have been in so many close games this
season, so we know thatwe are well within strik—
ing distance, even when we are down two runs,”
Aprile said. “In the third inning, we made hitting
adjustments, and Bravo’s homerun was evidence
of that.”

The Panthers added ﬁve more runs to secure
the victory and take the series lead 1-0.

In the second game of the series, the offense

added a homerun to Stevens two.

“I know that this team is able to’ score runs,”
Aprile said. “Ourpitchinghas carriedusmostofthe

which is something we talk about in practice.”

As for the Panthers’ pitching, both O’Connell
and fellow junior Cory Berliner earned their 10th
victories ofthe season. ' - V

Uconnellwas recently named to the Big East

Through all of this craziness I have realized
one thing: Phoenix is awesome.

I’ll admit, I haven’t really paid much at-
tention to the Coyotes, as the only time I
ever watch them play is in their annual game
against the Penguins. The Coyotes rarely play
on Versus’ nationally televised games, and

they are not one of the six teams that NBC ‘

acknowledges for existing.

But there is something special brewing
down there in the desert. The ﬁrst noticeably
unique thing about Phoenix is the aesthetic
awesomeness of ‘a Coyote as a hockey team’s
mascot. Much like the team, a coyote can be
heard off in the distance, but it is rarely seen
until it pounces. ‘

However, the real appeal to having a coyote
as a mascot is the fact that every time Phoenix
scores a goal, a loud howl is blasted through
the arena’s speakers.

The fans have also started-a new playoff
tradition (I know, the words “playoff” and
“tradition” when in reference to Phoenix
sounds so weird). The team is facing the De-
troit Red Wings'in the ﬁrst round, and any
team that has played the Red Wings in the
playoffs knows about Detroit’s fans throwing a
dead octopus on the ice,‘a tradition that stems
way back to when it only took eight wins to
claim the Stanley Cup.

So Phoenix decided to taunt Detroit by
copying that tradition, but adding a local
twist. Since it would be pretty dangerous to
throw a cactus onthe ice, a few fans started a
campaign to throw snakes on the ice.

~- - ~~~--—.w...-... ... -...—~. -..- A

guy really wants to own a team. If the sale had
gone through, Balsillie would have moved the
team to Southern Ontario to give Canadians
a seventh NHL team.

Thankfully, NHL Commissioner Gary Bet-
tman and the board of governors rejected the
sale to Balsillie. Instead, Coyotes ownerjerry
Moyes agreed to sell the team to the NHL.

The NHL will own the team until it is stable
and will sell the team when a suitable buyer is
found (Jim, put your hand down).

Many fans thought this would be the team’s
last season in the desert and more fans started
showing up to the games. What they realized
when they got there was, “Hey, this team’s
actually good.” . V I

Phoenix stormed its way to 50 wins this
year and secured a home—ice advantage in
the playoffs.

If that story isn’t enough to warm your A

heart and make you root for the Coyotes,
then their playoff opponent should affect
your decision. .

What is Phoenix’s reward for its best sea-
son in franchise history? Why, a ﬁrst round
match-up with perennial Cup favorites the
Detroit Red Wings, of course.

All the experts were saying this was a hor-
rible draw for the Coyotes and that the Red
Wings would win in ﬁve or six games. But the
Coyotes have taken a 2-1 lead in the series.

And if all that howling, snake—throwing
and beating-the-odds crap still isn’t enough
to earn your support, then take into consid-
eration what the fans chant at games.

“Let’s go ’Yotes” is perhaps one of the cool-
est chants, ever.
