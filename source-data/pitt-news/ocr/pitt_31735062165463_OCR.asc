ff Departments Enjoy Freedouni
 "Of Determining Requirements
 F or Masters Degree Theses

The decision by the University Graduate Council last
year to waive the University requirement for masters’ theses
in all departments has had different reprocussions in the
three divisions of the Academic Disciplines. 0

Putman Jones, Dean of the Graduate Faculties, stated
that the decision was made because “some departments

 

..—

 

thought they could get better 1-e—¢

sults in research through shorter
seminar papers. This is based on
the philosophy that a repetition
of an experience’ teaches more
than a single experience however
large. _

“The council recognized that in
some areas large papers were bet-
ter and in others it was better to
emphasize quantity. They decided
that although the goal of the stu-
dent writing intelligently about
his field would be the same for
_all areas, the means of testing
this would be left up to the indi-
vidual disciplines.”

Lauﬁer Reports

Max A. Lauffer, Dean of the
Natural Sciences, reports that
candidates for master’s degrees in
that division must write a thesis
to show marked attainment in
their field and to show their
knowledge of the techniques of
investigation.

“This educational experience
is extremely important to the
student,” Lauﬁer declared.
“There is no adequate subst-
itute.”

A Bernard Adams, assistant to the
Dean of the Humanities, reports
,that they have left the decision up
to the individual departments.
“The departments that have elimi-
nated the requirement, like the
Department of. English, have done
so for two reasons.

I Not Equipped
First of all, they feel that the

studentsat this level are not yet
equipped to do such a long paper.
This should not be done until
their dissertation. Secondly, there
are just too many students in
some of the departments and there

United Fund Sets
1962 Campaign “ _
For F aculty,Sto.ff

The 1962 United Fund campaign
among the faculty and staff begins
today and runs until October 22.
The theme of the drive is “Help
Them All —— All At Once.”

Dr. Stanton C. Crawford, sec-
retary of'the University and dean
of the faculties, launched a pre-
liminary driveon September 19.
He appealed for maximum parti-
cipation of the faculty and staff.

Commending the staff for its 70
percent participation record last
year, Dr. Crawford added; “We
must strive to do even better this
year.” ,

For the added convenience of
‘the faculty and ‘staff, quarterly
donations and payroll deductions
may bearranged with the payroll
oﬂice.

Stressing the community role of
the United Fund he said, “More
than 500,000 people beneﬁtted di-
rectly from the United Fund of

twelve months. This humane work
was distributed among more than

Two well-known campus institutions which had been

 consumed by the flames of student apathy in recent years
have been given the chance for a Phoenix-like resurrection.

Students and administrators have poked the cold ashes

-of the Pitt Chest and Block P and found that, despite the

ignominious endto which each activity had come, chances

.. remained for reviving them.

Last week, Student Government voted to re-establish
the Pitt Chest, a board which would supervise and consoli-
date all charity driveson campus and decide the apportion-
ment of the collected funds. Several years ago, the Chest
had thrived at the University, buteventually its lid was
locked as a result of poor administration, squabbling be-

-tween various supporting organizations and the general
‘loss of student interest.
' have continued to carry out their own pet charity drives,

School social and service clubs

but now it is felt that the ‘proposed consolidation. would
net greater gains for agreater number of charities. .
It may be assumed that students at the University

_ have not lost any degree of charitability while the Pitt

Chest was closeted; strong leadership by SG and its ‘assist-

, ing organizations, however, will certainly be needed to as-
sure any degree of success for the difﬁcult task of reestab-

lishing it. ,
Such a cut and dry situation does not surround the pro-
posed revival of Block P, however. The defunct flash-card

‘ cheering section was ofﬁcially disbanded two years ago '4
' when the “pep committee” literally threw away their

flash-cards in a burst of perverse enthusiasm.

Participating in Block P had become a chore for too
many students. Consideration of the team had long been
abandoned and few members of the student body voiced
any concern when the section was abolished.

Jerry Whalen, director of men’s housing,’stated last
week that “feelers have been put out” to test student
reaction to the idea, but the ‘results have not ‘yet indicated

‘any appreciable degree’ of interest.

Like the Pitt Chest, Block P is available to the students
for the asking. But it is doubtful that many will be asking.

She: “Are football players animals?”

She: “I don’t know, why don’t you?” C

He: “Okay, it’s like this. See, one team kicks
off to ‘the other. This means they’re giving the
ball to the opponents so that they can have a

She: “Why, of an the two-faced--—! If they

nAid

By Jim Kleinberg

The recent cut in the foreign aid appropriation
has stirred an expected amountof editorial com-.
ment. This is largely ‘because foreign aid, as an

" issue, remains unresolved in the American mind.

Why is this so? Basically because Americans, as a
notoriously practical people, believe in getting-

_ “something”_ for money given away.

In the case of !foreign aid, eternal friendship
appears to be the expected result. This “give-
away” of. billions has not made Krishna Menon
any more~.pro—American, nor his it worked too suc-

'cessfully in Southeast Asia. The Alliance for Prog-

ress is struggling to merely keep up with the grow-
ing population of South America, and‘ in many
places there have been -embarrasing and wasteful

"mistakes. Despite these and other criticisms, I/

believe that a positive case can be_built FOR
foreign aid. ‘ i

To begin an examination of foreign- aid, one
must be aware ‘of the nature of the conflict be-
tween the West and the Communist world. VVe are .
engaged, basically, in a struggle for survival. Our
weak spots‘ are constantly being pushed, our deter-
rents tested, and our patience tried. V
Pressure Points

If a spot on our perimeter would be pushed,
too hard, or our deterrent weakened, or our pat-
ience exasperated, the world might be pushed

into a nuclear war. There\is little reason to believe ,1

the Communists will stop their pressure on these
three fronts, so we must strengthen all of them
in order to contain the imperialism of world com-

.munism.

Foreign aid is the best answer to the problem"
of strengthening these perimeters, for’ several
reasons: (1) Aid enables the country to consoli-
date capital, and therefore begin industrializing
and modernizing its. economic structure; (2) Aid
enables the country to fulﬁll some of the “rising
expectations” of its" people, in regard to housing,_
education, and standard of living; and (3) Aid can
help th A I make ‘ ' ' Y

   

  
     

161 Of, .

- Aid is the one real weapon we have in the

- economic. struggle with the Communist Movement.

Nothing-is as frightening to the Communists as
the growing prosperity of the West v— both as a

tactical threat to the Reds and as a propaganda ~

weapon against Communist claims. Nothing but
an economicallystrong Western world, with dem-
ocracy ﬁrmly entrenched, can contain the Com-
munists and cause them to forget their plans of .
world rule.
Legislators Cry "Moneyl". _ b
Yet it is the very members of our legislature
who have opposed foreign .-aid, almost" from its
inception, who cry loudest when another chunk of,
land falls under the Red banner. To “save the --
American taxpayer” from this expediture, Repre...
sentative Passman and his committee have swung.
at the aid bill with meat—axe vengeance. . -
‘ Certainly criticisms can be leveled at the aid
program. The most importantof these is a need

for far better ‘management. Waste, inefﬁciency, and

mistakes seem inevitable in any large bureaucracy,

~ yet the record of this agency of’ the government '

should. be near—spotless, which it isn’t. It seems
silly. to think that by cutting such an" enormous
slice out of the aid appropriation bill,
Fowler Hamilton will suddenly crack down ‘on
wastes and poor planning. . V i

Bettermanagement, needed and desired, will
not come about by slashing the money needed to
operate -the Alliance for Progress, the Peace Corps,

7 "What's. in a’ Name"
Receives Crit-icism

Editor, the Pitt News
I was happy to read that Mr.
Barry Gross’ suggestion in his
column “What’s in a Name?”
was “not promptedby the sel-
ﬁsh feelings of a member of a
religious minority.” Being a
member of that same minority
group, I have met some, fortun-
ately not many, who have the
. same persecution and inferiority
complex that Mr. Gross seems to
have. I I
‘I personally enjoy the Christ-
mas season, carols, trees and all,
not because I - am an “inte-
grated‘non-Christian,” but be-
cause I think I have some ap-
preciation of beauty-, be it secu-
lar or religious.
‘ If we would follow Mr. Gross’
suggestion to its logical con.-
jclusion, we would remove from

 all our museums and galleries of‘

art those works of art which

had religious motifs. We would,-

pass legislation requiring that all
temples, churches, cathedrals,
and synagogues be located un-

derground so that their religious '

symbols would not offend the

delicate sensibilities of Mr. Gross
and others of his like.

It takes a simple or irrational

_ mind to apply the Supreme

' ‘Court decision which upheld the.

separation of church and state to
the Christmas Ball, which, to
my knowledge, has never been
dedicated, to Christianity or Je-
~sus Christ. _ s

I would call Mr. Gross" atten-
tion to the fact that the Christ-
mas Ball is held around the time

.of ﬁnals when time cannot be‘

spared for frivolities. I would al-
so extend an invitation‘ to
as; Gross to participate in the Stu-

_"’ dent Union Christmas Tree Dec-

orating Party, at which four-
’ ﬁfth of the students decorating
the tree are Jewish.
' If he would study their faces,
actions, and “unconscious” close-
ly- I am sure he would not find
any of _the persecution and in-
security he seems to feel, but
rather something called toler-
.”'*ance and appreciation of beauti-

ful ritual, two things he seems

never to have experienced.

I and many ofﬂmy co-relig-
ionists are proud of our relig-
ious heritage and do not feel
the need to stand on a pedestal
and shout “Don’t Touch Me!” I
thinkthat if it would make Mr.
Gross feel more secure, the Uni-
versity should dedicate to him a
dance called the Chanukah Hop
where he could spin his Dreidel

“ﬁyon into the night..: ‘

those privileges accorded to the-

majority, I say they should be
put back into their place.
This is what should be‘ done

not only to Mr. Gross’s articles ‘

but also to his ideas. As a mem-

I’m sure Mr. Gross seems to feel
that he is being forced to cele-

to celebrate Rosh Hashanah,

Yom Kippur and numerous other
holidays of this minority be-
cause of their inclusion among

the list of events in the Polaris
Handbook.

I now'pose a question: If we
are not to force the holidays of_
one religion on members of an-
other, should we not include in
the Polaris and the list of holi-
days those holidays for Catho-
lics, Buddhists and Shintoists.

I’m sure that Mr. Gross is
irked by the “Christmas” Ball
just as much as I am by the
special dorm and classprivileges
given those other minority mem-
bers to enable them to celebrate
their ‘holidays-.

Sure those holidays celebrated
by Christians as Christmas, Ne'~.'v
Yea_r’s‘ and Easter are given off-
but is not everyone—not just
those who profess a belief in

'ther_n—but everyone given those

holidays/. If these days bring ire
to the hearts ofthose who hold
no belief in" them,’ perhaps some-
thing should be done to see that

only the believers are dismissed -

from school for these holidays

and the others" attend classes as

usual.

I move now from the religious‘

to the other a-rgument Mr. Gross
uses——that the name “Christ-
mas” keeps many-from going to
the ball. At this time I would
like to say that I feel sorry that
Mr. .Gross does not_know what

he is talking about!

I know both ‘men and women
who are most certainly not

‘members of the Christian “ma-.

jority” and yet who have no
qualms about going to a dance
called the. “Christmas Ball”.
Perhaps, unlike Mr.. Gross,
theyare open.-minded enough to
celebrate the Christmas season
as a time of joyfulness
gaity and no school. Of all the
participants at the Christmas
dance I doubt that 3 percent or
even 1 percent of these minori-
ties stopped and thought out the
religious implications connected
to the use of “Christmas” as.the
name for a dance. ‘
Mr. Gross’ is ‘also appalled by
the “pseudo—Tradition” of fore-

naming items used during the

Yuletide season with “Christ-
mas”——Christmas trees, Christ-
mas cards. Mr. Gross would
then, I presume, forcehis ideas
upon the majority and remove
from sight within the University
all" signs bearing the word
Christmasand all.items used in
celebrating this holiday.

If this would be the case we
may say farewell to the Christ-
mas trees in the ‘dorms and the
Commons Room, the4Christmas

parties and present giving that‘

accompany the Christmas season
and surely the Christmas holi-

Adays—or should I say winter

vacation?—a,ltogether. ‘

I believe in freedom but also
in respecting the majority wish.
I feel that no one has a right
to knock someone else’s religious
beliefsbecause he does not agree
with them. Each to his .own and
peace on earth, good will to men.

‘Ideas and Figures’

Editor, the Pitt News

As Business Manager of Ideas
and Figures it is my job to pro-
mote the sale of the magazine _in
‘both personal and in profession-
al outlets such as the Univer-
sity Book Center.

Last week as Iwas checking
sales at_ the center I was po-
litely informed that the maga-
zine cost them too much time
and money (to merely record
and.shelf) and therefore was not
profitable enough to warrantethe
Book Store's sale of the book.

They desired to be either the
exclusive seller of the magazine
or not to carry it at all. Ap-
-parently, the 20 percent commis-
sion which they already gain
from the little publication does“
not justify any consideration of
a completely student conducted
endeavor such as Ideas and
Figures. .

I personally feel that it is
deeply regrettable that a com-
plex organization such as the
University of Pittsburgh Book
Center cannot see its way to do
its duty. The value of a book
center is to provide any books
to students and‘ the university

community, especially t h o s e
most pertinent to the student’s
development. '

That -return of a monetary
proﬁt does not justify chopping

The Anniversary Supplement
of September 17 Pitt News car-
ried an article by Mr. ViJay
which .pointed out the
general un-concern of the Uni-
versity community for the plight
ofthe foreign students on cam-
In the main we heartily
agree with ‘_ Mr. Jain’s sugges-
tions. ‘

And in accordance‘ with this,
we would like to bring your at-
tention to the fact that the
Y.W.C.A. at Pitt is engaged in

-.an effort to provide foreign stu-

dents with “the proper Univer-
sity atmosphere where the stu-

dents are among their ‘contem---

7’

poraries . . .

The Y.W.C.A., which functions
actively in 72 countries of the
world, is a multiracial, non—de-
nominational organization. Here
at Pitt, at the prompting of our
own members and some Univer-
sity. ofﬁcials, we have aimed
several aspects of our Fall pro-
gram toward making as many
foreign students as possible
“feel at home” as part of the
student -body. _

As our first step, with the aid
of the Ofﬁce of Cultural and Ed-
ucational Ex'change, we wrote
personal letters to all of the

.women students from other coun-

tries who came to Pitt for. the

I ﬁrst time this Fall. And on Sep-

tember 22, the YMCA and
YWCA sponsored a picnic! for a
number of‘ American and for-
eign students.

Our most. ambitious venture
has been to sponsor a series
called‘ “At Home at Pitt.” We
hope to iixslucle foreign students,
American students, graduates
and undergraduates in each of
the discussion groups. (The Sep-
tember 17 Pitt News carried a
column announcing the “At
Homes”)

' There is little that we can do
in the higher echelon of Univer-
sity administration to bring
about the necessary changes in
our foreign. student situation.
However, we can and do work
at the grass roots—the student
body.

By Anita Czujko
Dr. Mario Pei, Visiting Andrew
- Mellon Professor of Modern Lan-
guages, thinks, “Latin is not dead
at all.

“Until we have a better inter-
national language, Latin, which is
almost universally known, enables
people of all cultures to commu-
nicate.”

According to Dr. Pei, Latin sup-
plies a general background for all
the Romance languages, and also
for Greek and the Slavic lan-
guages, _which have the same
structure.

Standardized English
. Dr. Pei said that English should
be standardized if it is to become
the international language. “En-
glish is the fastest-growing lan-

-said in a recent interview.

Although he teaches a survey

course of the 30 main languages
in the world, Dr. Pei modestly
states, “I speak only four lan-
guages really well: English,
Italian, French, and Spanish. I
speak Portuguese fairly w e l 1,
and stumble around in about six
others. I have only structural
knowledge of most of the lan-
guages of the world.” _

Dr. Pei was born in Rome and
came to the United States at the
age ofseven. He learned Latin,
Greek, and French inphigh school.
r Tutored Minocal ‘

After a year tutoring the nep-

hews of Minocal, president of
Cuba, Dr. Pei taught French and
Spanish in high school. He then
taught at City College of New
‘York while he took night courses
for his bachelor’s degree. After
earning his Ph.D. degree in 1937
at Columbia Unive1'sity, he joined
the faculty and has been Profes-
sor of Romance Philosophy there
since 1952.

Dr. Pei, who has traveled
widely, said “Everybody is in-
terested in languages now be-
cause everybody wants to trav-
cl. 'When I was in Hungary,
I was completery nelpless be-
cause IF, didn't know the lan-
guage then. I had a taxi driver
who knew nothing but Hun-
garian, and we had to ﬁnd a
policeman who could translate
for us.”

(Concerning his classes here, Dr.
Pei says, “I find the studentsivery
stimulating. They are intellectual-
ly curious and very alert.” ‘

Information Flow Poor

Gold Explains Lag A

“The central disease of the communications

systems

connecting business oﬁ_"1ces and ﬁeld forces is too much com-
munication, but not enough information,” according to Dr.

Bela Gold.

Dr. Gold, professor of industrial and research in the
Graduate School of Business describes the diseases in today’s

issue of the Pittsburgh Businc,ss¢

Review, published by the Uni-
versity’s Bureau of Business Re-
Search.»

He explains that those on the
bottom end of the informal pipe-
line complain of drowning in ir-
relevant material while their ur-
gent informational needs are ._neg—

-_ lected. At the other", end, he adds,

the producers of the communica-

tions feel that such complaints are

the ﬁnal proof of the recipients’
inconsistency in asking for more,
increased
flow. ‘ ~

Saturation Bombing

Dr. Gold emphasizes that satu-
ration bombing may be justiﬁable
when directed against an enemy
but not when the targetiof the in-
formational output is an ally. The
researcher suggests three -‘means of
curing communications headaches:

Sending headquarter’ person-
-nel into the ﬁeld to ﬁnd out-
what thefront line needs in in-
formation. .

, Checking to ﬁnd out -- whether
_various kinds of information reach
their targets.

“Echo-inducing” devices to trig-
ger responses, such as offers: to
send additional} material, or ques-
tions calling for ‘replies.

Dr. Gold points.‘ out that a
constructive approach to the
improvement of communications
performance must begin by re-
cognizing‘ that the effective
functioning of any complex or-
ganization requires both spe-
cialization of parts and’ integra-
tion of each into the whole.

11* E xecs’ Ulcers

‘ the definite advantage to ac-
gquire what" every executive
.tends to classify as over-in-
dulgence — ulcers. Results of a

“a study by Dr. James P. Dunn, as-

sistant professor of Epidemiology,
show that this seemingly incon-
gruous fact is true.

"Dr. Dunn was assisted by Dr.

~ 4 Sidney Cobb, formerly of the Uni-

versity and now of the University
of Michigan and by the health di-
vision of. Oak Ridge (Tenn.) Na-
tional Laboratory in this unusual
study. , .

Samples-were observed of 37':
Pittsburgh management person-
nel, primarily in the $12,000 to
$25,000 income bracket, while 34
foremen and 273 craftsmen from
Tennessee were "studied.

Peptic Foremen
Not, only did the foremen show

 consistent evidence of the “execu-

tive indulgence,” but they also
tended to have more severe mani-
festations of peptic ulcers.

After being extensively ques-
tioned, more foremen, according
to written and physical tests,
had symptoms of ulcers. The
executives and craftsmen ﬁnish-
ed as “also rans.” I

Dr. Dunn hypothesizes that per-
haps the ulcers have a definite
correlation with certain jobs or
just certain types of people. who
are more prone to one job than
another.

Intriguing Postulate

,“It is intriguing to postulate
that persons with strong depend-
ency needs might make good fore-
men, he said. These people are
easier to discipline and more sen-
sitive to criticism. '

The’ foreman, once in his new
job, may find himself emotion-
ally alone or unsatisfied. Dr.
Dunn says that he hopes to test
these possibilities in the future.

The results of this study tend

I , to indicate that there is a correla-

tion between occupation and ulcer

disease. A little observation also »

indicates that the income bracket
is lower for those with ul_cers.
Perhaps, the executive‘s stomach
is satisfied and needs no further
stimulant. ‘ S

Mrs. Butler, Custodian of the

Many past students have re-

The Major Club of the physical

Butler a surprise party in the

“I wanted to slip away like a
thief-in-the-night,” said Mrs. But-
ler at the mid-day luncheon given
her by the school of education.
Dean Paul Masoner, school of ed-
ucation, presented Mrs.’ Butler
with a watch for her many serv-

“How is the weather up

for Mrs. Butler, who would

It was difficult for Mrs. Butler
to inhibit her “Mother-Hen” qual-

‘what she did, but the manner in;

which she helped each individual.

Care of gym suits, and all
equipment and apparel were
some of Mrs. Butler's’ duties.

She also had the‘ authority to

maintain order in the gymna-

Future plans for Mrs. Butler
center around ‘her two children

. .THE STARS "ARE BRIGHTER

WACO, Texas —_- The DC-7 ‘airliner lurched forward \on
the endless runway of the ‘Waco airport at 1 a.m.. Sunday (3
1:./a.m. E.D.T.). '

if Lou Slaby, 6-3, 235-pound fullback, stared out the win-

dow,- and scowled, “The stars are brighter in Salem, Ohio
than they are in Texas.”

The composer of “Deep in‘the Heart of Texas” would
have blushed had he been in Lou’s seat. The Texas skyline
was as dark as the outlook of the ‘vanquished "Baylor Bears.

But on the plane all-signs indicated a ‘high-pitched
victory. The players achieved all «sorts of weird_ and
i = piteous so_und effects in their strife to harmonize. There

was the squealing ‘bass, tenor and several voices in
between. ' '

No one sleps eve1i‘\td ough most of the players had been
rawakefor 24 hours an were due in Pittsburgh at 7 am.

Players were talking over certain‘ plays in which they
reveled. When a team loses they don't ‘remember plays,
only the ﬁnal score.

Looking up and. down the aisle even the most naive
spectator could recognize the signs of triumph. '

Across the aisle was ‘Marty Schottenheimer, a rangy
sophomore center who played 4-1 minutes —'more than
any of his teammates. He looked like he had fought a

, losing battle’ with insomnia for a week. ” . ’

“I’ll never envy the life of a major ‘league baseball play-

early moments of the fourth quarter, fourth and one, when
Kaltenbach caught a low-charinging Bear -head—on and crack-

ed him for a yard loss. . ‘ ‘

When LaQuinta entered the melee in the last.quarter
he cut down a runner with a knee-high tackle‘ that made_
fans shudder in the 35th row. He followed up with a few
more viscious stops, giving warning of better things to
come. ~ -

 There were others who rose to the occasion: Glenn
Lehner, Tom Brown, Ralph Conrad, Ed Clark, Rick Leeson
and John Telesky, the. latter booming under the armpits of
‘the Baylor defenders like a run-away jeep.

up the Bears, insisting on ﬁrst downs rather than elapsed
time. Al Grigaliunas. matched ‘his effort against Miami.
Al held onto a 19-yard heave from Tim Traﬁcant in the
third quarter on the Baylor six, and threw a good many
brisk blocks.

  John Jenkins was superb at the other flanker until he

For Long Runs

—By JIM O’BRIEN
WACO, Tex. —— The Uni-
_versity of Pittsburgh football
team threw more blocks
than an irate bunch of kind-

night here as they under-
mindedthe Baylor Bears, 24-14.

With sycle-like 'keeness, the
Panthers ripped open holes in the
enemy’s interior line, and pull-
ing guards, ends and backs were
rolling around the ends like un-
opposed tank columns as the vic-
tors compiled a sterling 376-yard
total offense mark.

Most of the yardage was mus-
tered overland as the. Panthers

The big gainers for the Panth-
ers were Ed Clark, 86 yards, Rick
Leeson, 64, Fred Mazurek, 58, and
John Telesky, 38. -

And there was nothing dull
about the offensive drive. The
ﬁrst score was indicative of the
al1—out effort. On fourth down on
the’ Baylor two-yard line, Quar-
terback Fred Mazurek pitched
over an eight-man line to End

But he didn’t quit and neither

Rushing Goal
Except for a brief lull midway
-in the contest, the Panthers ap-
plied rush after rush on .the‘Ohio
defense, but found it stubborn.

. Both Panther scores came in
-the second quarter.- Dave Reich-
enbach dented the net with a
hard shot for his second goal of
the young season, breaking in
from his left wing position dur-
ing a rush at the goal and tally-
ing» a sharp kick to the goalie’s
/right side. 4

Moments afterwards, Corky
Cuthbert, last y.ear’s scoring ‘ace
with 13 goals, went up with -the
Bobcat goalie for a high looping
shot out of the right corner and
headed the ball past him for a 2-0
lead. "A ‘

the season, struck back with 2:30

ter forward Haynes recovered it
and blasted it quickly into.the net.

‘A t t h e halftime , strategy '
meeting, Coach Leo Bemis call-

ed for more working of the ball ,

to the wings to spread the de-

fense. This was to correct a ’

prominent‘ Pitt mistake of the
ﬁrst half in which the whole
front line had ‘been bunched,
allowing the defense to close up.

The third quarter went by with
no score,'though a pushing penalty
saved Pitt. An alert call denied
Ohio a game-tying score at that
time. With four minutes gone in
the" fourth quarter, inside left Sid
Burton ﬁred an overpowering shot
from fifteen yards out to gain the
tie. .

Regulation time ended with the
2-2 score still standing, and the
two ﬁve—minute overtime periods
served only to emphasize goalie
Ron Berthold’s value to Ohio. Pitt
carried the ball in for shot after

Junior T0111 Jeffries

Drops Out of School

VVrestling prospects for the up-
coming season have taken a sharp
turn for the worse. Coach Rex
Perry’s ace 191 pounder Tom Jef-
fries has decided to drop out of

school.

The loss of Jeffries, plus five
seniors from last year’s squad,
including Rich Martin, Daryl Kel-
vington and John Zolikoff, means
that Perry will only have three of

last year’s regulars back—Jim
Harrison, Ken Barr. and Jeff
Ware.

A strong sophomore crop will
pick up part of the slack. But
even this ﬁne group has been
weakened by the loss of Ken

Warnick, outstanding 137-
pound prospect, because of scho-
lastic difficulty.

Perry, apparently, has a tough
job ahead of him. He begins that
job today in the wrestling room
where freshman wrestling prac-
tice begins.

All frosh are welcome to come
out for the team. Wrestlers in
the upper weight class are es-
pecially in demand, he says.

Varsity practice begins in a few
weeks.

Divers Practice at Trees Hall Pool

Students Fail to Fill Trees Pool

Bob Lewis, director -of the Trees
Hall swimming pool, is hoping
that more students and faculty
will take advantage of the new
mammoth pool across from the
Fitzgerald Field House. “Every-
one who has used the new pool
has enjoyed it very much,” said
Mr. Lewis.

The pool is open daily from 8
am. to 9 p.m., Saturday 10 a.m.
to 5 p.m., and on Sunday from 1
to 5 p.m. The pool will be closed

on the days of football games and
Sundays when the Steelers are at
home. .

Closing the pool is necessary
because of the lack of parking fa-
cilities during these events. ,

The pool is entirely free of
charge, if the swimmer brings his
own suit and towel. Otherwise
the cost is ten cents apiece for
the rental of a suit and towel.
Also -.1. key will be given to the
swimmer for one of the lockers.

We would like to call

that is both consistant with
teachings of scripture.

Ellis Begins

Science Talks

on

‘I n Philosoiahy

The University’s 1962-63 Philo-
sophy of Science Lecture Series
will begin tomorrow and Wed-
nesday with two lectures on “The
Origin of Newton’s Laws'of Mo-
tion.”

The lectures will be delivered
by Brian Ellis, visiting assistant
professor and associate in the
philosophy department and a sen-
ior lecturer in the department of
history and philosophy of science
at the University of Melbourne,
Australia.

The series will include lectures
by ﬁve other philosophers and
scientists and will be free to the
public.

All lectures in the series will be
held in Scaife Hall auditorium at
8:15 p.m.

The remaining lectures will
deal with the foundations of
scientiﬁc inference, philosophy
and cybernetics, scientiﬁc infor-
mation, and language and sci-
ence.

The ﬁrst speaker, Brian Ellis,
has published several articles, in-
cluding “Has the Universe a ,Be-
ginning in Time?” and the manu-
script of his book on “Logic of
Physical Measurement” is in the
ﬁnal stages.

Mr. Ellis is the 1952 winner of
the George Murray Prize as the
most distinguished graduate in the
humanities from Oxford Univer-
sity.

S U Sounds .
Sound Better

A new sound system has been
installed in the Student Union.
According to Larry Heller, SU
Board Director, the new equip-
ment makes available more ver-
satile programming with better
sound reproduction.

The new system, installed in
the lobby, lounges, cafeteria, sup-
per room, Hunt Room, and the
Venetian Room, enables music to
be piped in or live programs to
originate in any one of the major
areas.

The new sound method is prov-
ing more satisfactory than a reg-
ular public address system, since
the speakers and microphones are
permanent. The sound equipment
is available for use by any group
using the rooms for their activi-
ties.

Cathedral Cleanup

Crashes Classes

Students have reported to The
Pitt News that construction in and
around the lower levels of the
Cathedral is making it “diﬁicult,
and even impossible at times, to
conduct classes, especially in the
ground floor and basement
rooms.”

The ‘drilling is associated with
improvements being made in the
sprinkling system. According to
Bruce" A. Allen, assistant superin-
tendent of building, the work
should be completed in about six
weeks. He said that as much
work as possible was done in Au-
gust, when there were no classes.

Providing that the weather
does not interfere with the con-
struction, the deors leading to the
courtyard should be in usein
about three weeks, Allen stated.
