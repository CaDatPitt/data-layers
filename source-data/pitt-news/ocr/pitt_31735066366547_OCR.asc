lture and Society. By George
"Peter Murdock. The University
-of.« Pittsburgh Press. 376 pp. $7.

..—.~P'rl°>ofesso*r Murdock is Andrew
[Mellon Professor of Anthropology
at the University. - --

By BILL CABIN

What is Culture? What is So-
ciety? How are they distinct?

entists have been striving to an-
swer these questions for over 150
years.

7]’ From the armchair speculation
of early theorists such as Comte
and Spencer to the systematic
wizardly of Parsons and Smelser,
the quest has continued. Intellec-
tuals have posited theories of cul-
ture change and delineated com-
«plex schemes for analyzing so-
Tcietal and cultural variables.

Amidst the ﬂurry of pompous
__..theorizing, the discipline of an-
thropology has grown to a healthy
maturity in recent years. Guiding
such growth have been ‘men like
_M_alinowski, Radcliffe-Brown,
V Kroeb'er, Kluckhohn, and a mul-
titude of others whose names are
commonplace to those in the
ﬁeld.

’ George Peter Murdock emerges
among contemporary ﬁgures as a
guiding force in the quest to de-
ﬁne society and culture and es-
tablish the credibility of anthro-
pological analysis.

i- In his most recent book, Cul-
ture and Society, he selects es-
says from his voluminous writ-

praisal of the major issues in
cultural anthropology.

» The" basic tenet of anthropo-
logy as a comparative science
runs through Murdock’s varied
essays on the topics of the na-
ture of culture, culture change,
[arid social organization.

He conveys the importance of
the comparative approach by a
blending of speciﬁc applications
"of methodology and more matter-
‘of-fact accounts of the anthropo-
logical approach:

‘the following,.true story, empha-

When a ruling Arab sheikh
recently visited a certain Amer-
can city, a matron who was the.
leader of local society gave a
ceremonial dinner in his hon-
or. When he and his retinue
arrived, they were offered cock-
tails. Being a Moslem, the
sheikh felt compelled to ob-
serve his religion’s taboo on al-
coholic beverages, at least on
so public an occasion, and inti-
mated that he would accept at
Coca Cola instead. There hap-

pened to be none in the house, _

so the butler was dispatched to
the neighborhood store.

While he was away, the
others present courteously but
uncomfortably refrained from
drinking out of respect to the
guest of honor. Later at the
dinner table, when the entree
was brought on, it was, of all
things, a roast suckling pig
with an apple in its mouth.
When the Arabs politely re-
fused servings of the abomina-
tion, the embarrassed hostess
had nothing to offer as a sub-
stitute except cold cuts. And it
was soon discovered that the
only cold cuts in the house
were ham. '

In another essay, “Waging Base-

ball on Truk,” Murdock conveys
the signiﬁcance of changing rec-
reation patterns. The natives of
Truk, he recounts, had war as”
their favorite pastime.

sizing the need for cross-cultural
research: I

   

mans, the Trukese were without _
a satisfactory replacement for
war. A new pastime was needed.

What better replacement than
the great American national past-
time of baseball—introduced by
the Japanese? Murdock lists some
of the adulterated baseball lingo
the Japanese taught the Trukese.
Among the more interesting
terms are “Caman bebby!” (Come
on, baby), “Peecha” (pitcher),
and “Faw bworr!” (foul ball).

The imposition of this ne,w=-.
form of recreation also manifest-
ed itself in song. One song, sung
to the tune of ‘‘someone’s in the
Kitchen with Dinah,” ends with
the_refrain “Maybe you go ben-
jo.”‘

Murdock’s witty commentary
on the song is: “Since the last
word is Japanese for ‘latrine,’ the
song is a way of telling the op-
posing team where they can head
in, with overtones of ‘conjuring
up a touch of dys/entery.”

‘To some such incidents may
merely serve as amusing anece-
dotes; to others they may be in-
teresting notes on the oddities of
human ‘nature; to Murdock they
are signiﬁcant examples of the
need and value of anthropologic-
al / analysis. ‘

g This variety of appeal and in-
terest makes Culture and Society
a mirror reflecting the basic im-’
ports of the anthropologist’s pur-

.ent topic, for a different reason,

 

pose: understanding the diversity
of human behavior by using the
comparative approach to derive.
generalizable rules.

The generalizable part of the
book is the result of Murdock’s
position as an anthropologists. In
each essay, he deals with a differ-

but always with the anthropo-
logical frame of reference.

Yet, this is the only pervasive
part of the book. There is no

narrow concern for one area of
inquiry as the essays cover a
variety of interests Murdock has
explored during his 34 year ca-
reer. There is not always the
same presentation; the range
varies from the almost armchair
account of the Trukese and the
Moslem to the systematic delinea-
tion of patterns in kinship, po-
litics, and the division of labor.

As such, the book serves as a
primer on major issues of anth-
l'0D010gy, a collection of inter- 7
estingl and often amusing ac- ‘
counts, a compact presentation
of the Murdock cross-cultural ap-
proach, and a series of ﬁndings
broadening the scope of social
science. V

Culture and Society is not sole-
ly for the sophisticate, not ex-
clusively for the curious reader,

and not strictly written for the
liberal arts student—it is for all.

Distribution A
Changes

. The Liberal Arts Cabinet has
submitted a proposal to James
A. Kehl, dean of the School of
Liberal Arts, revising the distri-
bution of studies requirements,
according to Michael Olsher,
chairman of the Cabinet.

Olsher said, “We hope that the
proposal was discussed and voted
on at yesterday’s meeting of the

Academic Assembly. The faculty V

is already cognizant of its con-
tents.” The Academic Assembly is

School of Liberal Arts,
' The proposal is: In order to ful-
ﬁll his distribution of studies re-
quirements, a Liberal Arts stu-
dent be required to take nine
credits in each of three academic
disciplines and that these nine
credits be dispersed among three
departments within that disci-
pline.

The Liberal Arts student is re-
quired to take an additional _18
credits’ of distribution and that

these additional 18 credits be —

taken in any of the three disci-
plines, providing the student’s
eligibility for these satisﬁes the
pre-requisite program establish-
ed by each department.

These additional 18 credits are
not to be taken in the nature of
satisfying the student’s require-
ments for his major or minor
ﬁelds of study.

With the initiation of this dis-
tribution of studies program, it
should become immediately avail-
able to all students.

In regard to upperclass distri-
bution of studies (namely the
180’s courses), an upperclass Lib-
eral Arts student be permitted
the‘ option of taking either the
180’s or the 80’s course if offered
by a department for distribution
credit. '

Tom Huck sought scientific excitement

Ohio University conferred a B.S.E.E. degree on
C. T. Huck in 1956. Tom knew of Western Elec-
\tric’s history of manufacturing development. He
realized, too, that our personnel development pro-
gram was expanding to meet tomorrow's demands.
After graduation, Tom immediately began to
work on the development of electronic switching
systems. Then, in 1958, Tom went to the Bell Tele-
phone Laboratories on a temporary assignment to
help in the advancement of our national. military
capabilities. At their Whippany, New Jersey, labs,
Tom worked with the W.E. development team on
computer circuitry for the Nike Zeus guidance sys-
- tern. Tom then moved on to a new assignment at
W.E.’s Columbus, Ohio, Works. There, Tom is work-
ing on the development of testing circuitry for the
memory phase of electronic switching systems.

politely deferred on Wednesday to Theodore

guest appearance at the University. Sacri-

Tgree weather and joined Bob Loch, director
-of the Student Union (SU), and John Smith,
iiformer vice-chairman of the SU Board, in
"a trip to the airport to escort Mr. Sorensen
?to the University.

 Plagued with the fear that we would be

Tglanced at the escalator and,recognized a
Elifamiliar face——Ted Sorensen had arrived.

V’  Quiet and unassuming, his unquench-
_7,able curiosity was immediately apparent,_as
f-he quizzed us on all aspects of the Univer-
ity, ranging from the new football coach

PKJPSIIRE Presents

P ' F Students United for. Responsible Expression (SURE) present the
most plausible platform (see story, page 1) of the three groups competing
iii_',_ the Student Government election. Their ideas, in general, are more
progressive than the tired-outcries of the Mamdani’s Pitt Progressive
Party (PPP) and concern more substantial matters than the petty, over-

All three groups deal with the problems of dormitory rules and park-
ing, evolving policies in the same general direction. The SURE platform,
however, deals with other substantial issues with plausible solutions in the
realm of student government. Mamdani and Engels deal with less sub-
stantial problems which can be lumped in the usual pile of trivial matters
student government has traditonally discussed.

_ Engels’ more profound interests are setting up a permanant file of
ests available to all students in the University library, listing all profes-
—"f.=*sors by their courses in the time schedule, rewriting the course catalogues
and a rest area for commuters on the 12th floor of the Cathedral.

_ , ‘First, these matters are not the substantive type issues to be pre-
""sented in a platform. Many can be handled by memo or phone call once
a personis in office-—-they do not require legislation. Second, there is not
9. need for all. Commuters do not, in general, want to travel up the ele-
_ vators to rest in the puritanical security of the 12th floor‘CL. Third,
vllseveral of-the platform items are already being worked on.

Both Mamdani and'Engels propose some type of discount in the Book Cen-
ter, but neglect the fact the -Pennsylvania State Legislature currently has
2. bill pending which would exempt textbooks from the state stakes text
(Senate Bill 188). J

PPP regresses by still giving prime attention to the Student Activi-
ties Fee without a thorough evaluation of the working of the present com-
mittee. They also present an all too general method for students partici-
pating in tenure and promotion deliberations on professors.
' SURE, however, presents issues which are substantial; ones which
are of direct concern to the improvement of students’ campus lifes; ones
which have plausible solutions through student government.

By Linda Goldstein

tion he felt that one could do nothing to
prevent a determined assassin from firing
a fatal shot. “I’d rather not talk about it,”
was his terse reply. ‘

THEODORE SORENSEN, the man, as-
sumed a new, intense manner when hespoke
as Theodore Sorensen, close associate of
John F. Kennedy. “People were suspicious
of all the wrong things in the 1960 elec-
tion,” he proclaimed. \“They began to under-
stand what he was really like -after he" be-
came President." , V » _

When asked to name Kennedy’s greatest
contribution, he emphasized that “John
Fitzgerald Kennedy was the author of hope

i —hope that politics in this country could

rise above the mediocre, hope that the all-
American dream for equal opportunity could
be realized. That’s what John Kennedy
gave us—hope.” .

AS A SPECTATOR for the late Presi-
dent, Mr. Sorensen thought that the ad-
dress that “probably made the most differ-

ence” was the June 10, 1965 talk_ at Ameri- ~
can University. “This was the first speech '

by an American President to ‘look beyond
the Cold War. The speech had a major ef-
fect. in bringing about the signing of the
Nuclear Test Ban Treaty,” he added.

A vital participant in the Kennedy ad-
ministration, Ted Sorensen is in a quandary
about his future. “I face a difficult decision
for I'm now at the crossroads. "Everything
Hook at appears less challenging than what
I did.” One can only hope that Theodore
Sorensen finds another challenge enabling
him to utilize the Kennedy legacy.

This is the crux of_the issue. All three groups present views of dormi-

discourses on “The Meaning
of a University” in the At-
lantic. He offers a well-arti-
culated description of what
will never be again. He traces
the historical growth of the
problem, of deﬁnition. He
speaks of the great, tradi-

tional republic of learning-

and of the rights, duties and
responsibilties of the student
therein. ' '

But his republic has been
overwhelmed. Surely he must
realizethat by clinging stub-
bornly to this vision of what
is past, he loses his chance
to have a say in what the
replacement will be.

His university, the custo-
dian of learning, is being

,/

swept away in a tidal wave’

of public interest (one hesi-
tates to use the word greed,
but it is partially applicable).

The universities need a
new ideology,‘ a new set of
beliefs and dogmas and goals
and ways of doing ,.things.
The present ivory tower ideal
is simply incompatible with
the goals and pressures and
demands of the surrounding
society.

The ﬁrst tenetof the new
ideology can be the necessity

of solving the Negro prob-

lem. The universities, using
idealistic students and sup-
posedly idealistic faculty, can
undertake to infuse doses of
valuable learning into’ the
Negro population rather than
into the middle class, from
the bottom up.

_This can be done by plug-
ging in a second tenet of the
new ideology — this one
thought up by students —

participatory democracy.”
Irving Kristol (in “What’-s
Bugging the Students” in
the Atlantic) denigrates this
pattern of student partici-

By BILL JEROME

As their ﬁrst song ended, the

nine Serendipity Singers on the

[stage of Carnegie Music Hall bow-
ed politely, not exactly in danger
of catching pneumonia from wind-
mills .of applause. Then Bryan
Sennett, the leader of the group,
came up to the microphone to
address the audience. He could
have just cupped his hand around
his mouth. Or over it.

Eyeing large blocks of empty
maroon seats, and smaller blocks
of Pitt students similarly ma-
rooned, he began to speak to the
embarrassed group. “You’re prob-
ably wonderering,” he said, “why
we invited such a select few. . .”

It was a grimly laughable open-
er to those who gathered for the
concert, which was a “benefit”
for Pitt’s Men’s Loan Funds and
sponsored by the Men’s Dorm
Council, Men’s Council, and In-
terfraternity Council.

But the Serendipity group —
ironically, -they describe their
name as “an unexpected discov-

ery of a new and happy event”—,~

did their best to prevent at least

an artistic disaster by putting

forth a spirited display of humor
and musicianship.

They deﬁne their sound -as

. “folk jazz,” which is fol_k-orient-

ed but with jazz arrangements

and instrumentation. The size of-

the group is a factor here, since
with seven male and two female
voices there are more complex
chord patterns that can be intro-
duced than with smaller folk en-
sembles. The voicing that results
from this set-up often seems more
typical of modern jazz than of
the folk idiom.

Among the songs showing off
this unique‘ sound were Soon It's
Gonna Rain, which featured
strong, moody transitions from a
major key into a minor one, and
Chilly Winds Doth Blow. In Sun-

shine Special the group used its
vocal talents to duplicate a train’s
whistle.

Instrumentally, the Singers use
fairly standard folk equipment:
steel-string guitars, 12-string gui-
tars, tenor guitars, classical gui-
tars, ﬁve-string banjo, tenor ban-
jo, string bass, tambourines, etc.

‘ These are often passed around

the group between numbers, de-
pending on the speciﬁc sound
they are about to produce and
the personal involved.

In the ‘Beatles’ And I Love Her,
for example, a conga drum was
used underneath a melody fea-
turing several changes of _key ef-
fected by the voices and guitars.
In the spirituals, Every Time .I
Feel This Way and Let Me Fly to
Mount Zion, the shout-singing
was wildly punctuated by tam-
bourines. A Western song, Boots
and Stetsons, was one of several
songs featuring crisp banjo work.

Young, Bryan Sennett, John Mad-
den, Brooks Hatch, Mike Brow-

ed and equally-talented. The con-
cert featured numerous comic
blackouts, but" the emphasis was
on the songs, one of which was
Don’t Let the Rain Come Down,
their ﬁrst hit.

Under less-than-ideal circum-
stances, the Singers put on a
totally professional show. Bassist
Bob Young said it was “the smal-
lest group we've played for, but
very nice.” He claimed his group
was unaffected by the attendance.
Perhaps they are used to per-
forming for a “select few” — in
coffee-houses and night clubs -
but crowds of coffee-house pro-

portion belong in coffee-houses,
not Carnegie Hall.

1- inexperience’ Hinders Both Teams

Wrestlers Face Syracuse
Tomorrow at Field House

By TOM SACKS, Assistant Sports Editor
With eight sophomores in the line-up the wrestling
team’s chances of upending defending E.I.W.A.champion
Syracuse in tomorrow’s 3 p.m. meet at the field house hard-

ly seem favorable.

Taking a closer look, however, the Orange is in similar
straights. Their three Eastern champs—Lou Roberts (167),

Jerry Everling (191) and Jim
Nance (heavyweight) -— have all
graduated. Tom Schlendorf, wrest-
ling at 191, will be their biggest
threat tomorrow. Schlendorf was
the runner-up last year in the
177 division at the Easterns.

Pitted against Schlendorf Sat-
urday will be sophomore Jack
Williams, who won his match
last week at Temple. “If Wil-
liams gives it all he has it could
be a really good match,” said
coach Dave Johnson. '

“But I’m afraid he’ll be gun-
shy. It’s easy when you see a"
mountain as your opponent. Over-
all Pd say Syracuse. is in about
the same position we are.”

In wrestling, the outcome of
most matches are known before
the meet even starts. The East-
ern mat powers form a close knit
group and reputations get around
faster than gossip. Tomorrow
should be a ‘different story, how-
ever. Johnson doesn’_t know much
about Syracuse and the Orange

will know even less about John- '

son’s sophomore squad.
“These kids are in really good
shape,” said Johnson. '“I’m lucky

gar ~k *

I have such an eager group to
work with. They make up for
their lack of experience with
hard work. They have to because
if they didn’t we wouldn’t be in
the running at all.”

Out of the running tomorrow
will be Dino Boni, the matmen’s
top wrestler. Boni is scheduled
for a placement exam for grad-
uate school Saturday which can’t
be reschedule.d. Said Johnson, “It

hurts but what can you do.”

As a result of Boni’s absence
the. line-up has been reshuifled.
At 123, Tony Liberati will be
wrestling. At 130 and 137, Bob
Schuchgart and Dick Shildt have

_switched places. Replacing Boni

at 145 will be Jim Rhone, who
wrestled in the 152 pound di-
vision last week.

Clair Riley has moved down
to ﬁll Rhone’s vacated spot.
Breaking into the line-up at 160
and 167 are Cliff Zolikoff and Tim
Trax, while Randy Kaylor re.-
mained in the 177 division. Wil-
liams and Terry Hoover (heavy-
weight) round out the list.‘

By ROY JACOBS

Sometimes one outstand-
ing player can lead a team to
victory‘; but is usually the
well-balanced team that wins.
And so, it was an offensively bal-
anced and defensively stingy
freshmen basketball squad that
ripped the Westminster JV’s, 81-
55, Wednesday evening at the
Field House.

“The whole team played well,”
analyzed coach Tim Grgurich af-
ter the game, “especially Albert.”
DiFrischia, who had some prob-
lems in the Cubs’ previous game
against St. Bonaventure, led

apiece to complement DiFrischia.

shot rarely and concentrated on
ball handling‘ and setting up
plays.

Wesminster seemed to rely
solely on their freshman forward
Russell Boston, who matched Di-
Frischia’s 21 points. However, the
rest of the squad could not keep
pace, contributing only 34 more
points.
