SLIS professor wins award  

V Staff Writer

By Cesca Antonelli
Staff Writer

Toni Carbo Bearman, dean of Pitt’s School
of Library and Information Science, received
the 1995 Pennsylvania Library Association
Distinguished Service Award. Bearman won
the award for her outstanding leadership and
contributions.

“She has inspired, future library and infor-
mation science leaders,” said a representative
of the Pennsylvania Library Association.

In addition to the award, Bearman has been
elected vice president/president-elect of the
Association for Library and Information
Science Education, which is an association
devoted to the advancement of knowledge
and learning in information science.

’ As dean, Bearman has extended the SLIS’
involvement in programs sponsored by the
university, broadening its scope to include
fieldss like telecommunications and archival

sciences. Since her arrival, the SLIS has
become one of the largest programs of its
kind in North America and ranks as one of the
top in the nation.

Before arriving at Pitt, Bearman was the
executive director of the National
Commission on Libraries and Information
Science, which is the agency that advises the
president and Congress on policy and plan-
ning in this field.

Bearman was also recently elected to the
Council of the American Association for the
Advancement of Science. She chaired the
AAAS’ Section T, which dealt with informa-
tion, computing and‘ communication.
Bearman served on the Board of the Greater
Pittsburgh Literacy Council and as president
of the American Society for Information
Science. In 1994, the Clinton Administration
named her the only academic and library rep-
resentative to the U.S. Advisory Council on
the National Information Infrastructure.

The Learning Skills
Center, located at 311

-WPU, is offering stu-

dents the opportunity to
be student academic
counselors and supple-
mental instructors. These
opportunities provide
good students the chance
to build their résumés,
improve their communi-
cations skills and assist
others.

Candy Streightiff, a
dual major in business
and psychology who
came’ to the Learning
Skills Center to improve
her studying skills, said,
“This place is good,
motivating, and people
took the time to under-‘
stand me. It gave me an
incentive to do better.”

Another
Christine Hamer, a
sophomore majoring in
biology, came to the cen-
ter to get help for her

-pre—calculus class. She _
said, “Since the universi-

ty is so big, it’s nice to
have the one—on-one con-
tact you get at the
Learning Skills Center.”
The center is a positive
place for both the stu-
dents providing help and
those who receive help.

MOSCOW — As top special-

painstaking review of Russia’s
eligibility for critical foreign
loans. President Boris Yeltsin
has embarked on a pre—election
promising spree that econo-

his commitment to economic
discipline.

Experts, whose assessment
may determine Russia’s access
to $9 million in Western lend-
ing, are worried that Yeltsin’s
budget-busting promises, if he
keeps them, could undermine
the country’s market reforms by
igniting inﬂation, according to

During the last two weeks,
Yeltsin has announced a range

China’s assertion that there is

The right to get out

Burning the American flag  it’s every person’s constitutional
right to destroy the symbol of the freedom that Americans have.
The Supreme Court upheld the right to do it as an expression of
free speech. If you are dissatisfied with the way things are going
here, burn the flag to ashes, and you can’t be arrested. OK, fine.
Now, however, the latest trend in anti-democracy campaigns is
far beyond flag burning or refusing to say the Pledge of
Allegiance. The newest manifestation is an anti-America
league.

The group is the brain child of one of our old friends in Libya,
Mu’ammar Qaddafi. Well, we know Mu’ ammar was never very
fond of the United States, and this just proves it. It’s OK,
though; he doesn’t have to like this country.

The troubling thing about Qaddafi’s new group is that
Qaddafi found a friend in Louis Farrakhan, an American citizen.
In a recent meeting between the two, Qaddafi promised to give
Farrakhan a large chunk of money ($1 billion) to fund a chapter
of the group in the United States.

Of course, it is just as much a person’s right in America to
belong to an anti—American league as it is to burn the American
flag. But think about it for a second. What other country in the
world would allow this kind of thing to exist? Very few places
come to mind. In some countries, political dissenters are either
deported or killed. Only the United States allows its citizens the
freedom to blatantly oppose itself.

The anti-American league also presents an interesting prob-
lem. Exactly what is the purpose of this group? Is it just a place
for a bunch of unhappy people to get together and complain?
Highly unlikely. What kinds of activities will this group partici-
pate in? Letter writing campaigns to members of Congress?
Again, highly unlikely. A group which proclaims itself (by its
very name) to be against the American Way has the potential to
be a serious threat to national security.

The point: is not that the group should not be allowed to exist.
In America, people have the right to belong to any group they
want. The point is that the group should never have to exist
within America’s boundaries. If you are that unhappy with the

” freedoms you have as a-citizen of this country, "try rrioving to
Russia for a year. If you hate it here enough to join an anti-

American league, renounce your citizenship and move to Cuba.
If you think this country is so oppressive, emigrate to China.
But don’t even -think about forming an anti-wherever league in
one of those places. You’ll most likely be shot. i

If you think it is really so bad in America that we need an
anti-America league, you are free to leave. No one is forcing
you to stay here. So get out. So long, we’ll miss you. But think
about this: how many political refugees try to escape into
America every year? If you go somewhere else and decide
maybe America wasn’t all that bad, just remember that they
might not let you leave.

hanks to the recent
. publication of Pitt’s
problems, we all know

exactly what is wrong with
this university. No more
baseless complaining .-— we
have official proof. And
we.’re not the only ones who

‘ know this now; any interest-

ed party can easily find out
how awful this place is. It’s
taking all the fun out of
whining about Pitt. '_ I

The report raises some
very serious issues that the
university simply has not
tackled. It has finally pushed
these and other problems
into the realm of public
scrutiny. The trustees decid-
ed to make this report public
from the moment they com-
missioned it, and they asked
that the report be blunt. This
was an immensely brave step
for them to take, and they
should be commended for
this at least, even if there is
little else for which to com-
mend them. A

Complaining about Pitt has
always been a popular stu-
dent pastime. Pitt sucks
because our professbrs are
awful, classes are dull, the
lines are too long, the cafete-
ria is nasty and the -city is
boring. Pitt students are
hardly atypical. This hap-
pens on campuses nation-
wide. It’s hard to say how
much of it we mean. We con-
tinue to do it, however,

‘because-everyone else is

doing it and it makes for
good small talk with people
we don’t know all that well
(or with people we do know
well but with whom we’_ve
discussed absolutely every-
thing else). It’s cool to
whine. Just don’t start
believing yourself.

Pitt has many things to
offer ifyou bother to look.
as does Pittsburgh itself. The
report mentioned this, and it
said that Pitt shouldplay
these things up more.

Rebecca
Briggs
Academically, t—he university
has some terrific programs,
and they’re not all related to
the health professions. Take
a look at the philosophy
department, second only to
Princeton. Political science
and history are ranked very
high nationally, and there are
many other, though:som«e-
times smaller, departments
that'are'extremely good. The
University Honors College is
a unique and nationally rec-
ognized asset to the universi-
ty that has not received near-
ly the amount of attention it

should.

The report mentions the
lack of communal university
pride, but the size and dis-
parate composition of. Pitt
does not allow for this. It’s
not really feasible to expect
that this can happen, and
perhaps this isn’t such a bad
thing. Pitt.c_ioesn’t have the
idyllic collegiate. atmos-
phere, buttit does have bene-
fits that other campuses
don’t. The university has
something for almost every-
one —— from the Comic Book
Club to the various Greek
organizations. Anyone can
find a niche.

Few people at Pitt can
complain about living for
four years in a bubble. The
real world hits Pitt students
from the first day of orienta-
tion whether they like it or
not. Some don’t and proba-
bly would prefer a sedate
college setting. But it is
wonderful for those who
came to college precisely to
get away from sedate set-
tings and who want to have

access to myriad cultural _

activities.

It’s a_ shame simply to stay
in Oakland, however. There
are worthwhile clubs. restau-
rants, theaters. bars and
museums all over the city.

The city has a lot of hidden

Pitt has it all, except publicity

little eateries, bookstores and ’

hang-out spots with strong
local flavor that are'fascinat-
ing to discover. The city is
not boring. Anyone who says
that it is merely needs to get

up off his or her couch and '

venture outside. Even the
accent cangrow on youif
you give it a chance.

After spending nearly four
years here, I have to say that

‘J Pitt has "prepared ‘me.w'e_ll.

My education hasn’t been

perfect, but I don’t regret my"

decision to enroll here at all.

I have received a wide vari-

ety of perspectives both from
professors and from other
students. The university and
surrounding community have
provided me with countless
opportunities to discover for

myself. who I am and what I

believe in.'The very fact that
there is no typical Pitt stu-
dent with a typical Pitt atti-
tude has allowed me to
investigate ideas freely. I
was not coerced into believ-
ing that there was a certain
way to‘ go through my four
years at Pitt or that there was

any specific Pitt thing that l- '

should be doing.

It may not be cool to szty
so, but I have loved go rag to
this university and harging
out in the ‘Burgh. it's my
hope that more people will

.understand that Pitt is ;

strong academic center in an

exciting community and _that ‘

Pitt’s administration and

trustees will understand that .
they need to capitalize on the —

many positive aspects of this
university. And I hope that
they seriously consider and
act upon the recommenda-
tions of the report so that Pitt
can come to be respected as
the great institution that it
deserves; to be. —

completed a nice put-in and
free throw to put Pitt ahead
27-25.

Nelson, subbing for JoJo
Guzman, was one of the many
bench contributors for Bruce.
He praised the Lady Panthers’
bench effort.

“Tressa Bolfert played a
solid four minutes. Julie
Fornadel played a positive

game. Missy Thompson has
been struggling but she
helped us out,” Bruce said.
Following the Panthers’
early lead, WVU continued
their aggressive defense, forc-
ing numerous Pitt turnovers.
But the Lady Panthers
endured. Following Bolfert’s
two free throws and
Guzman’s driving layup and
free throws, Pitt built a 10-

point lead at 3:58 of the first
half.

Pitt managed to lead 48-41
at halftime, despite WVU’s
holding of Pitt’s leading scor-
er, Latia Howard, to only four
points.

But Howard came out
smoking in the second half.
She started out with a pull-up
jumper followed by a put-in at
18:08 after a nice feed from
Montesano.

“I got frustrated in the first
half,” Howard said. “I missed
a couple layups. At halftime,
I decided to pick it up. I went
after it.” _

“Rock over London .
Rock on Chicago!!!” This is
the rallying cry of Wesley
Willis and you best believe he
means it. You best believe
he'll make you say “RAH!”
You best believe he’ll rock
“your mutha fuckin’ ass.”
Amen! If you haven’t heard of
him, and chances are if you're
not from Chicago you haven’t,
here’s the scoop:

Wesley Willis is one of
Chicago's most prolific, ener-
getic, enigmatic and contro-
versial artist/musicians- He’s
been praised by such luminar-
ies as Mike D, Eddie Vedder
and Spike Lee as being a
genius  but what's so great
about Wesley? Simply put, he
rocks hard. Not afraid to be
brutally honest, Willis tells it
like he sees it, or more appro-
priately, like he hears it. Much
of the Willis cannon is based
on the many evil voices he
hears in his head. Clearly an

Chicago. People began buying
his drawings and soon enough
he had a showing. Around this
time he started to record
poems and songs with a key-
board accompaniment. Almost
all of the songs were the same
pre-programmed tune and fea-
tured Willis’ penchant for catch
phrases ‘and commercial
sound bites. Justin, the bassist
of Davenport, recalls, ‘‘It was
the first or second practice I
had with Davenport  some-
body put in this scratchy boot-
leg tape, and it was amazing!

* One song started, ‘Hit me with
‘ an explosion sound right now!’

and he hit some button on his
keyboard that made a bomb
sound; most had an intro
telling what the song was
about. Davenport started quot-
ing Wesley all the time, and I
wrote him a fan letter.” One of
their favorites comes from
“Raise Some Hell”— “Jesus
will get you for listening to this.
He will lightening jolt your ass.
It will shock the shit out of you;
THINK ABOUT lT!!” Yikesl
Willis soon got a band
together to back him up —
Fiasco. They are an alterna-
metal band and add a bit of
variety to the equation. Each
song gets individual treatment
and all are guaranteed to rock

group has a CD out on Urban
Legends of some new and
updated material. Highlights
include “He’s Doing Time In
Jail” (kind of a rap number),
‘‘I’m Sorry That I Got Fat” (live)
and “Steve Albini.” The latter is
a good representation of the
typical praise song Willis is
prone to write. He’s shouted

Close your eyes and imag-
ine an American punk band
with a worldwide following.
What do you see? Old Black
Flag circa Damaged? Now try
to imagine a garage band
from Ohio that plays a lot of
shows in Belgium  maybe a
little hard to picture. But that’s
the story of Columbus, Ohio’s
New Bomb Turks.

This Sunday night, these

   

trans-oceanic geek punks
bring their stripped-down style
to Cloud 9. If you haven’t
heard of them around here,
you can be forgiven. Bassist
Matt Fleber told Option that
“we’ve never been accepted
by the rock scene in
Columbus  we were always
seen as record-collecting
geeks.” That collecting experi-
ence produceda sound that

started off and stayed hard,
fast, simple and fun as hell.
Musically, The New Bomb
Turks just lean back into their
wall-of-sound and rock. Songs
are usually three minutes or
under, and their last, most pol-
ished album was recorded in
only nine hours.

Their no-bullshit approach
to music continues lyrically.
The Turks sing about what’s
on their minds, regardless of
whether it’s offensive or not.
That’s pretty standard for
punk rock. What's not stan-
dard is not copping an atti-
tude. This band doesn’t pre-
tend to be more angry than
they are, unlike the new crop
of poppy, fake-angry punks in
Call or the “real” angry anar-
chist types around the world.
They admit to liking the
Smiths and Prince, avoid

overt politics and sing about .

mooning people. This refusal
to play the typical punk-rock
role gets some hard stares in
Europe and the U.S., but the
band doesn’t care —— they're
just in it for fun.

The Turks’ latest album,
Pissing Out the Poison on
Crypt Records, consists of
remixes of early, vital Bomb
tracks that came out on poor-
ly-mixed 7—inches at first. Now

THE PIT

TNEWS

 

you can enjoy 25 of their clas-
sics like “Pist,” “Crying in the
Beer of a Drunk Man” and
“Anal Swipe” as remastered by
Mike Mariconda. |t’s good.

Live, the Turks are insane.
You might just get yanked
onstage by singer Eric
Davidson if you stay in the
front. Be prepared to enjoy a
performance from a band who
knows how to put on a show,
because as Reber told
Keraang, ‘‘I’m a concert-goer
more than anything else.”

Also appearing with the New
Bomb Turks will be local fun
punks The Steel Miners, whose
7-inch “Excuse Me, You Can't
Park There b/w 8 Track Head”
makes me laugh every time I
see those damn lawn chairs
holding someone’s place after
a snowstorm. They_ also have a
new, soon-to-be-released
record on Get Hip entitled “Dig”
to support. It features more of
the same straightahead good-

 
 
 
  

times punk rock.

Finally, opening the show will
be Anti—Flag, “fast—kid punks”
from our very own University of
Pittsburgh. If you’ve seen them
(and you’ve had plenty of
chances), you know they kick
out a nice show too. Enjoy as
Justin Sane spits into the
crowd.

in all, Sunday night is the
night to catch a one-of—a-kind
pretension-free punk show in
Pittsburgh. If you miss the
Turks this time, you may have
to go to Belgium to see them
again.

Don't miss the New Bomb
Turks appearing with The Steel
Miners and Anti-F/ag at Cloud
Nine on Sunday Feb, 4, at 8:00
p.m. The price is only $6.00, so
you'll have enough money left
over for some Manic Panic for
the mohawk.

Beastie Boys
Aglio e O/io
Grand Royal

What’s that you say’? The
Beastie Boys, arbiters of cool
whose every release should be
heralded as opening a new
door for music, have a new
disc out and you didn’t know?
All right, stop apologizing.
Actually, it’s only an EP with
eight songs and clocks in at a
whopping 11 minutes (that’s
1:22 per song in case you
were wondering). Aglio e Olio,
though consisting of brand-
new material, is all hardcore in
much the same vein as the ‘94

reissu of their early efforts
Some Old Bu//shit (but with an

’ extra decade to practice those

three chords).

The inimitable Mike D is han-
dling the lead screaming on
this one, and borrowing a
member of the Beasties’
extended family, the man
AWOL, to free him from his
usual percussive duties. (See
also “Time for Livin”’ and
“Heart Attack Man”.) Operating
as a four-piece for the disc, the
rest of the band have appar-
ently been working out their
(formidable) hardcore muscles.
Yauch’s powerful but precise
bass drives the songs in true
hardcore fashion, while Ad-
Rock’s guitar remains all but

‘buried, save for some deliber-

ately feeble fills. Mr. Diamond’s
rantings, when declpherable,
seem to be preoccupied with
the time-honored hardcore
ethic of self—reliance and per-
sonal responsibility. On the
typically straightforward “Deal
With It,’’ he drops such wisdom
as ‘you can’t bring me / down
to a world of self-pity / not

afraid to / deal with it.” (Hey,
this stuff was never subtle.) I
think you get the picture.
Although the Beasties can’t
help throwing in the occasional
studio sound effect or goofy
voice-over, they seem to be
taking themselves (uncharac-
teristically) seriously here and
succeed in paying tribute to
their early ‘80s NYC hardcore
roots.

Though the Beasties have
been consistently incorporating
a couple of hardcore songs on
their last few albums, this is
their first (mature) offering of
nothing but. Even though the
disc, from the newly nostalgic
Beastie Boys, could be seen
as an anomaly compared to
their usual albums of ground-
breaking brilliance, Aglio e O/io
is enjoyed best when taken as
the 11 minutes of good, clean
fun it is, while also serving
rather conveniently to hold us
over until the release of The In
Sound From Way Out (an all-
instrumental album, no less)
sometime in March.

Hockey

a family to stay with, food to eat and generally took care of him. They
would have even put him through college. All he had to do in return was
play hockey, and play it well.

“We practiced at ﬁve o’clock in the morning. I went home and ate, lifted
a little, and went back,” Elliot said. “If you went to school, you wouldn’t
have a social life.”

Over 40 players anived at the Ice training camp with Elliot, but after one
week, 23 were cut.

“They treated you like you were in the army that ﬁrst week,” Elliot said.
Elliot‘ made the cut.

“They were looking for 18 players,” Elliot said. ‘

That meant an additional three players had to go, Elliot was one of them.
It was not for lack of skill or strength of will. Instead, Elliot separated his
shoulder in a game against Boston.

“I had never really been hurt before,” he said realizing how quickly and
badly players are injured. Now, he couldn’t play and the Ice sent him
home. _ ’

V “When I left, I kinda just ﬁgured that that was my chance,” Elliot said.

He returned home and decided to enroll at Pitt.

“I didn’t want to go away again,” he said. ‘

He didn’t. Elliot still lives at home and commutes to Pitt everyday.

When asked if he could still play in the IHL, Elliot said, “I don’t think I
lost my skills.” -

Elliot is a junior math major. His father and aunt are both teachers.

“I don’t see myself doing anything else,” he said, who has dressed up-in
full hockey equipment to visit his aunt’s elementary students at local
Keystone Oaks Elementary School.

Elliot said he likes kids and wants to teach on an elementary school
level. - '

Hockey might be in his future, but last year’s league MVP is not count-
ing on it. Elliot wants to find a good teaching job and get on with life, but
that won’t be until 1997. Until then Pitt fans and Pitt’s hockey team can
expect the services of Elliot. -

qualiﬁed for the IC4As. Lewis sin-
gled out the improvement in the
distance crew as one of the major
differences in the team this year.

“It starts with the people work-
ing with the kids,” said Lewis,
referring to assistant coaches
David Sabol, Mary Allison
Williams and Joanne Warner.

Sobal has managed to bring out
the best in a distance crew that in

the past has often been overshad-
owed by Pitt’s outstanding sprint-
ers.

' So far, Lewis has been pleased
with the season. “Ninety—f1ve per-
cent of the men have qualiﬁed for
the IC4As, and 95 percent of the
women have qualified for
the ECACS. The freshmen are
doing great; they have filled
up some gaps. The team is com-
plete.”

College Republicans go at it. Or how about a CW 0 versus ZBT
foulfest (no ﬂash photography, please)? The Interfraternity Council
could challenge the editorial staff of The Pitt News: The opportuni-

ties are endless.

Pick your promotion, but get people in the building. Once inside,
the games will sell themselves. Wil1ard’s fast—paced offense and
Kirk Bruce’s young and improving women’s squad are sure to hook
some fans. Whatever the record, both teams deserve campus sup-

port.
