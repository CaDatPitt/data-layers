Student
group to host
typhoon relief

   

beneﬁt dinner

Chris Puzia
For The Pitt News

In response to a storm that devastated the
Philippines earlier this month, students
and U.S. citizens are raising awareness and
supporting relief efforts — especially one
Pitt organization. “

The Filipino Students Association wants
to raise awareness and funds to provide rel
lief to the region devastated by the typhoon,
and many club members feelpersonally
involved.

On Nov. 8, Typhoon Haiyan, which is '

known in the Philippines as Typhoon Yolanj
da, surged through the country with a path
of 370 miles wide and gusts that reached 235
miles per hour. One week later, the United
Nations estimated the death toll to have
reached 4,200 people.

According to the U.N., more/than a week
after the storm subsided, at least 2.5 million
people are left without food in the Philip
pines, more than 11.8 million people have
been affected and almost 1 million have
been displaced.

president of the FSA, is Filipino and lived’

This year’s Student Govern  ment Board elece V 

tion proved that fewer candidates and less
campaigning make for a dramatically lower
voter turnout.
V Only 10 students competed for the eight
‘seats on the Board. President—elect Mike Ni-
tes ran uncontested, receiving 1,965 votes.
Only 2,520 students -—— 13.7 percent of Pitt’s

non-College of General Studies undergradu-
ates — voted in Thursday’s election. The
election saw a decrease of about 54 percent
in vdter t'(m{6iiE;“&ib£vﬁ1frorri last year’s nim-
out of about 30 percent.’ V

Aaron Gish, Elections Committee chair-
man, said before the election that rates of
voter participation had been on the rise over
the past few years. After the results were an-
nounced, he blamed fewer candidates and
a less dramatic election day for yesterday’s

low voter turnout.
“I don’t think there is a question that
fewer candidates are going to generate
‘ léss’V6tes,” Gish said. “Almost every single
aspect of the election was more dramatic
last year.”
Gish said last year’s election was “hard

interest. These factors, he said, attracted

more voters. ‘ -
“Generally after a really dramatic ye

with a lot of high tensions, fewer candidates

will run [in the next election] ,” Gish said.
Students voted online and at campus

polling stations in Market Central and Litch—

ﬁeld Towers from 8 a.m. to'8 p.m. Each non-
College of General Studies undergraduate

, student could cast votes for up to ﬁve Board

members and one president as well as vote
“yes” or “no” on three proposals, termed
“referenda,” to alter the SGB Constitution.

The majority of students who voted were
in favor of all three of these referenda. One
of these changed the wording and format of
some portions of the constitution. Another

increased the minimum GPA requirement
for the Board president and members from
2.5 to 2.75. The ballot also included a ref-
erendum that will reduce the number of
Board candidates for whom each student
can vote from ﬁve to three.-

SGB is responsible for allocatingthe $2.3

l million Student Activities Fund to student

organizations. Every non-College of General

' Studies undergraduate student pays $80

into the fund each semester. 2
The 2014 Board members, listed in th
order of highest number of votes received,

T are Ellie Tsatsos, Andrew Abboud, Bran-

don Benjamin, Graeme Meyer, Sara'Klein,

Mona Kazour, Jake Radziwon and Abby

Zurschmit.

Lauren Barney and Ron Reha were not
elected to the Board.

“It was hard fought, and I’m glad that

« my slate mates got on,” Reha said. “I’ll just

keep doing what I’m doing, I guess.”

Although Barney was on the ballot, she
did not actively campaign. V

Barney said she believed the Elections
Code was broken when Gish extended the
deadline for candidate applications after
the o_riginal deadline had passed.

“I was in silence in the campaign,” she
said, adding.that she chose to focus her
efforts on working on other SGB-related
projects instead.

Although Barney is not a member of the
Board, she has been working with Nites to
eliminate Saturday ﬁnals, an initiative she
campaigned on when she unsuccessfully
ran for_ the 2013 Board. ”

Barney said she purposely left her name
on the ballot, and would have accepted the
position if elected. '

“I worked really hard to get on the ballot,.
and I showed initiative,” she said. “I thought
I deserved to be on the ballot just as much
as anyone else.” ' 

Because Tsatsos, Abboud and Benjamirﬁ:
were the three candidates who received 
largest shares of total votes, they will be 
pointed as representatives to the University}
Senate Council. ' 

As the Board member candidate who

received the most votes, Tsatsos will receive -

the title of president pro—tempore. This”;

means that she will assume the office of SGB '

president in the event that Nites is no longer.

able or willing to fulﬁll his responsibilities.
Tsatsos said she plans to “start learning;

about how the whole process works,” so 

i can smoothly transition onto the Board. f5;

“It’s bittersweet. I’m really excited about;
the people who won, but I’m also really sad;
about the one [slate member] who lost,” '
she said. }[—.I

Tsatsos added that she is excited to serve.
asa representative to the University Senate. I
4 i “I like tovbe part of agroup, but also have
that extra say in how things go,” she said.

Abboud, who ran with Kazour and Zur— A

schmit on the Three Rivers slate, said he
was happy his entire slate goton Board.

“We’ve all put a lot of foundationalwork
in already,” he said. “I think it’s great that we
all got on and now we can work together to
accomplish these goals together.”

Benjamin said he was “thrilled” that he
and Klein were both elected.

“If it had been me and not her, it would
have been bittersweet,” Benjamin said.
“She’s one of my’ closest friends.”

The SGB Elections Committee adver-
tised the election in campus publications
and through different events. Gish said that
there were events hosted in Market Central
and the Perch. WPTS Radio and the Elec-
tions Committee also held a debate between
candidates on Nov. 12 in Nordy’s Place.

While SGB held these events to promote
the election on campus, Maddie Bank, a

‘sophomore accounting major, said she

didn’t follow the SGB campaigns and did
not vote. A  .

“If you live off campus, it’s hard to be
informed,” Bank said.

Gish said he worked to advertise the
election, but he added that the most effec-

tive way to elicit student interest is for the
candidates to address students themselves.

“By advocating for themselves, they
also increase awareness for the election,”
he said.

The candidates spent election day at-
tempting to raise awareness and persuade
students to vote by passing out ﬂyers and
small gifts such as bags of popcorn, lollipops
and beverage koozies.

Candidates also used social media to
reach out to voters. They sent out tweets
and posted Facebook statuses reminding
students when and where to vote.

The members of Pitt Gold slate took it

a step ﬁirther than most on Facebook to

garner attention.— particularly Meyer.

“I changed my birthday to today on Face-_
book so everyone is messaging me telling
me, ‘happy birthday,’ and I say, ‘Oh, just
kidding, but by the way, don’t forget to-vote
today,” Meyer said. _

Reha and Tsatsos, fellow, candidates

from the Pitt Gold slate, used the same

tactic.

Kazour, a candidate from Three Rivers
slate, said she asked students if they knew
what SGB was, and then explained where
to ﬁnd the candidates’ initiatives and how
to vote. '

“We [weren’t] trying to force it down
their throats,” Kazour said. “We [were] just
trying to make them more informed.”

While candidates maintained a high pro-
ﬁle on campus Thursday, the stakes were
lower than in previous years.

“I’d say [election day] is a lot more re-
laxed compared to last year, at least for me,”
Nites said prior to the election.

Meyer said he thinks candidates would
have had more active campaigns if there
had been more competition.

“Honestly, we have all worked hard,
but there is no sense in lying,” Meyer said
“There was less campaigning [than last
year] .” '

Radziwon said he did not participate
in the paper campaign and did not think it
made an impact on his campaign.

I “I had a lot of things going on, and doing
the paper campaign wasn’t my top priority,”
Radziwon said.

Although competition was milder than
last year, Meyer said the election was still
“anybody’s game.” I

“I am nervous,” he said before the results

were read. “I think you would be afool right
now to not be nervous.” ’,

During the election for the 2013 Student
Government Board, slates openly paired
up with other slates of three candidates in
order to create groups of six. This would
allow students to vote for a cohesive group
of six candidates on election day. '

Doﬁtas said that the FSA noticed an
increase in interest in the club after the
disaster.

“We’re really amazed that people are
willing to drop everything and help,” Doﬁtas
said. .“A lot of people have been coming to
meetings.”

Doﬁtas said the‘ club will host a ﬁ1ndrais-

group will donate the funds to the Red Cross

Doﬁtas added that the club also hopes
the dinner event will increase interest in the
FSA and encourage new members to join.
The club currently has about 20 dedicated
members who consistently attend meet-
ings, though not all of them are Filipino.

Doﬁtas said that is what she likes about
the club, because “people from different

an exclusive organization.”

She said she hopes that the upcoming

Circumcision: an unnecessary, brutal
, practice for those who can’t consent

Natalie Russell
Columnist

“Here’s this little bundle . .. First let’s
ﬁnd a sharp stone or knife and start
hacking at the genitalia,” begins
journalist Christopher Hitchens,
setting up a scenario that about 58
percent of male infants born in the
United States went thr0ughin2010.

“Because, as it turns out,” Hitch—.

ens continues, “the design isn’t that
great, and in a crucial feature, too.”

He concludes, “No morally de-'

cent person would do this if itwasn’t
for superstition.”
Infant male circumcision is a

I practice not often questioned by

new parents. It’s either divinely
warranted or it’s just something
that people do. But witnessing a
ceremony like this should cause out-
rageinany morally normal person.

Reputable studies by the World
Health Organization and the Cen-
ters for Disease Control have shown
that there is evidence of circumci-
sion preventing the contraction of
sexually transmitted diseases such
as HPV and HIV. This is reasonable,
considering there is a 44 percent

~ lower rate of HIV infection among
circumcised men.

“But doesn’tthat contradictyour
point?” you might ask.

I would answer:~no. My point
isn’t that male circumcision is al-

ways morally wrong, but that it’s a
sinister practice to inflict on non-
consenting infants.

These studies are likely as sig-
niﬁcant as they sound, but we can
rest assured that a child is not at
risk for STDs in his infancy or in
childhood. A procedure that is un-
necessary, painﬁil, traumatic and
even life—threatening should never
be inflicted on a child until he isable

to consent to the operation himself.

Alternatively, circumcision in
the late teenage and early adult years
isarelatively simple procedure that
affords safe administration of an-
esthesia, typically costs less than

$1,000 and, more -importantly, A ’

allows the person to give consent.
Accordingto Dr. AaronTobianfrom
Johns Hopkins University, infant cir-
cumcision typically costs between
$250 and $300.

But, let’s talk about hygiene —

a favorite subject of circumcision
advocates. Is there any evidence
to conclude that an uncircumcised
penis is less hygienic? It’s a popu-
lar truism, but certainly not a well-

supported one.

It’s true that an uncircumcised
penis is generally more difﬁcult to
clean compared with one that is cir-

_ cumcised. But it’s no more difficult

than proper cleaning of a woman’s
genitalia. If hygiene were a stand-
alone argument for circumcision,
there would be no reason not to cir-
cumcise the labia on female infants.

Worse than the hygiene argu-

‘ ment is reasoning backed by social
» standards, such as meshing well

socially in the locker room or em-
bodyingthe stereotypical traditions
of their fathers. No one wants their
child to be uncomfortable with his
body or outcast from his peers. But
if the cost of ﬁtting in is subjecting
an infant to torturous levels of pain
and high volumes ofblood loss, the
better choice should be obvious.
It’s unlikely that an uncircum-
cised penis will even be all that
unusual in social circumstances in
the ﬁiture anyway, since the rate of
procedures has been steadily de-
creasing.
Over the past three decades, the

rate of circumcisions performed on

newborn boys in U.S. hospitals has
dropped six percentage points, ac-
cording to U.S. government data.
The rate was 64.5 percent in 1979,
with an all-time high of 64.9 per-
cent in 1981. all-time low was

V recorded in 2007 55.4-_percent

of newborns circumcised,  more
recent ‘data.  Shown just a slight
increase at 58.3 percent in 2010.
9 Part ofthis decline has to dowith
greater publicawareness of the risks
of the procedure, but another major
driving forceis perhaps even more
telling. The federaliMedicaid pro-
gram has cutoffﬁmdingfor circum-
cisions in 18 states underthe prem-
ise that the procedure hasn’tproven
to be medically necessary. Insurers
have also increasingly limited cover-
age for infant male circumcision for
the same reason.
Maimonides, the canonized

~ Jewishphilosophenarguedthatthe

primary purpose for circumcision
was to reduce a man’s sexual desire
and pleasure. This is a likely conse-
quence, since the foreskin can con-
tain as many as 70,000 erogenous
nerve endings, which, I might add,
speaks volumes about the potential
pain of circumcision. It’s underthis
same premise that women across
the world are regularly circum-
cised -— where the clitoris, labia or
botl1 are removed —— particularly in
parts of Africa and the Middle East.
Although it has no basis in Islamic
‘texts, female genital mutilation is
commonly performed in Islamic
countries as a means of preserving
the purity and chastity of women.
If“relig'ious freedom” gives par-
ents the authority to subject their
infant children to genital mutilation,
perhaps a circumcision should be
performed on this immoral bind of
church and state. I

Recent history
against Loyola

on Panthers’
5 side

.Dave Uhrmacher
Senior Staﬁ Wrz'ter

For any team in any sport, beating an op-
ponent three years in a row is difficult. For
the Pitt women’s basketball team, that task
is even more grueling, especially when you
consider that the Panthers have failed to win
more than 13 games in any one of their previ—.
ous three seasons. _

But in the case of the Loyola Greyhounds,
Pitt has dominated for three consecutive
years. 1

Coming off its second loss in a row, Pitt
travels to Loyola (Md.) Saturday for a noncon-
ference battle with the Greyhounds. Tipoff is
scheduled for 1 p.m. at Reitz Arena.

Loyola (1-3), a member of the Patriot
League, won its ﬁrst game of the season
Wednesday night against Howard after drop-
ping the ﬁrst three regular—season contests
to Maryland, Hartford and East Carolina.

Pitt (2-2) enters the game after losingits
previous two games by a combined eight
points, a testament to the better brand of
basketball the Panthers are already playing
this season under head coach Suzie McCo-
nne11—Serio.

Senior Shane Gordon is ionizing to extend his Pitt career by clinching a-bowl berth Saturday. Sheldon Satenstein| Assistantvisual Editor

Nate Barnes
Sports Editor

Pitt football has only two chances remaining
on its schedule to become bowl-eligible at six
wins. The matchup Saturday in the Carrier
Dome at Syracuse may be the best chance
the Panthers have left to earn a bowl bid.

Pitt (5-5, 2-4 ACC) heads to upstate New
York after a loss to North Carolina at Heinz
Field, in which the Panthers came back from
a 24-point deﬁcit to ultimately lose on a punt
returned for a touchdown.

“We all know that you earn the right at
another game by winning,” Pitt head coach
Paul Chryst said. “You need six, and we’re
not at six.”

Syracuse (5-5, 3-3 ACC), also in its ﬁrst
year as an ACC member, also seeks bowl
eligibility after the Orange received a 59-3
beatdown from No. 2 Florida State last week.

“It’s abig game forboth us and Syracuse,”
Chryst said..“We’re both 5-5.”

After Saturday, the Panthers’ last game
comes against Miami, who just recently fell
out of the top—25 rankings, so picking up a
win against the Orange is paramount.

For Pitt to do so and become bowl—eligi—
ble, the Panthers need to limit the effective-
ness of a Syracuse rushing attack that racks
up nearly 200 yards per game.Jerome Smith
and Prince—Tyson Gulley lead the Orange,
and the running backs owns longest runs of
66 and 67 yards, respectively, as a testament

to their game—breaking ability.

Smith leads Syracuse with 149 carries for
706 yards and 10 touchdowns. Gulley has
rushed for 440 yards on 79 attempts and
has scored four times, as has Terrel Hunt.

,To limit Syracuse’s talented backﬁeld, the
Panthers must be strong up the middle. That
starts with senior middle linebacker Shane
Gordon, who made his ﬁrst career start at
Syracuse in 2010.

While Gordon missed a few games be-
cause of an injury, his leadership has an-
chored a defense that has shown much im~
provement since it allowed Duke to score
55 points in the third game of the season.

tallest player is 9 inches shorter than the
6—foot—11 Anderson.

“When you have Bubbles in the game, they
pay so much attention to her that it opens
up your outside game, which was the case
[Wednesday] for us offensively,” McConnell—
Serio said.

The outside—shooting prowess of the
Panthers is something they hope to carry
over from their loss to Michigan Saturday.
Pitt sank 11 of 25 attempts from beyond the
arc, one off the mark from setting a new
program record.

Following the trip the Baltimore —— Pitt’s
third road game in its past four contests —
the Panthers return home for a three-game
set. Mount St. Mary’s (on Nov. 26), Buffalo
(Dec. 1) andjames Madison (Dec. 4) will all

visit the Petersen Events Center in the next
two weeks.

McConnel1—Serio said the Panthers are
continuing to work in practice on focusing
on execution and creating plays on both sides
of the ball, something they will have to do to
stretch thewinning streak against Loyola to
four consecutive years.

“We are a work in progress and we will
get better,” McConnel1—Serio said Wednes-
day night. “We talked the last two days
about working efﬁciently on offense, and
I am proud of how that transferred over in
the [Michigan] game. Our margin for er-
ror is so small, the missed opportunities get
magniﬁed. We have to ﬁnd ways to get over
the hump and be more successﬁil down the
stretch, and I know we will.” 3

WEEKEND ‘PREVIEW

  Weekend  
slate chock

full of action“

Dustin Gabler
Senior Staff Writer

Pitt’s athletics are stretched from Syra-
cuse to Baltimore in this busy weekend,‘
and although the football and volleyball
seasons are winding down, the Panthers
enter a big weekend ﬁlled with activity.
Track and ﬁeldhosts its Blue-Gold

meet and the swimming and diving team ’

competes in one of its busiest weekends of
the year. Pitt’s wrestlers encounter their
ﬁrst real challenges, ﬁrst against a fellow
top-25 team, then in a tournament featur-
ing 1o"of the top 51 ranked teams. The
women’s basketball team will look to avoid
a losing streak that it hasn’t had since
2004 while the volleyball team is trying

to ﬁnish its inaugural ACC season strong. V

Pitt football at Syracuse _

With bowl eligibility on the line for
both schools, the Saturday matchup be-
tween Pitt (5-5) and Syracuse (5-5) has
huge implications for the Panthers, who
will face a tough Miami team in their sea-
son ﬁnale. - .

Both squads are coming off disappoint-
ing losses last week. Against North Caro-
lina, Pitt came back from a 27-3 deﬁcit to
tie the score at 27-27, but lost on a second
punt return for a touchdown. The Orange
apparently traveled to Tallahassee, but af-
ter trailing 28-0 after the ﬁrst quarter, it’s
questionable if they actually showed up.

Swimming and diving hosts Pitt Pan-
thers Invitational

Both the men’s and women’s swim-
ming and diving teams are in action this
weekend as Pitt hosts the Pitt Panthers
Invitational at Trees Pool on Friday, Sat-
urday and Sunday.

Each team is 2-2 after both beat St. Bo-
naventure and Bucknell and lost to Notre
Dame and Virginia Tech.

On the back end of the defense, senior
corner K’Waun Williams is also trying to
make the most of his ﬁnal games as a Panther.

“I’m trying to ball out,” Williams said.
“Give it everything I_ got, don’t sell myself

short and put it all down on the line.”

' One aspect of the game Saturday that
may beneﬁt the Panthers is the familiarity
Pitt already has with Syracuse, in contrast
to the number of new opponents played in
the conference this season.

“I think for some of the guys it will cer-
tainly help,” Chryst said. “For some of our
juniors and seniors and guys that have been.
up there before, it will be helpﬁil.” _

With the experience players such as Gor-
don and Williams have from their tenures
at Pitt, Chryst hopes they can shed light on

4 what to expect from the Orange.

” “We want our older players to talk to the
younger guys and tell them what kind of
game this is going to be,” Chrystsaid. “We
expect it to be physical.”

That physicality was shown last season
when the teams combined forjust 27 points
in a 14-13 Syracuse win.

Pitt fell behind, 14-0, early in that game,
and a comeback attempt fell short when
Tino Sunseri was sacked multiple times and
