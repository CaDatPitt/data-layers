Engineering
speaker advises
preparation,
self-confidence

By Sam Gresock

News Assistant

Self-confidence and interview preparation are
essential in landing that job you’ve always dreamed
about.

At least that is the opinion of Hal Greeney, who
works for the information technology firm EDS. -
l “The economy isn’t all that good, and jobs are
hard to get,” Greeney said. “But the good news is
they aren’t really that hard to get, if you know what
you’re doing.” ~

Greeney spoke about successful interviewing dur-
ing yesterday afternoon’s meeting of Pitt’s
Engineering Student Council.

As one of EDS’ college recruiters, Greeney -

has interviewed hundreds of job-seeking students
over the past several years. However, he said a stel-
lar academic record and mountains of job experi-
ence can only go so far in assuring a productive job
hunt. ' _ '

“Only about one in 30 [job candidates] comes into
the interview prepared, but that person will get the
job if they really want it,” Grinney said.

“They may have just a 3.0 QPA and little work
experience, but what they do have is they know
what the heck they’re after and they know how to
interview.

“Work on getting a job, not just getting good
grades,” he added.

Greeney said one of the best ways to prepare
for an interview is to narrow down the list of
prospective companies and to a select only a few,

, since it takes about five hours preparing for each

interview.

“You’ve spent four years and all this money [in
college] to get a career, so why spend one half-hour
preparing for an interview that’s going to give you
what you want?” Greeney asked. “You have to cen-
terin on three, four or five companies that you really
want a job with.” S l ‘ V

GPSA reiterates fee increase

)3

By Mark Gordon
Staff Writer

A brand-new newspaper
for graduate students and a
$3 increase in student activity
fees were the main issues
discussed at last night’s
Graduate and Professional
Student Association assembly
meeting. ' '

Steve Parks, GPSA presi-
dent, said, “Last year [we]
passed a resolution to raise
the fee from S7 to $10.”

The increase is necessary
"to give GPSA a budget to
continue serv-ices [such as]
free legaladvice and travel
accounts,” Parks said.

“Almost all our programs
will be in jeopardy unless we

get this fee increase, said
GPSA business manager
David Sidore. “Built into the
increase is a GSO fund that
will benefit the smaller
schools.”

The expansion of the grad-
uate student newsletter to a
monthly newspaper was
another hot topic at the
meeting. The inaugural issue
of the Advocate was eight
pages long and contained
articles on graduate student
concerns such as finding
quality housing and the diffi-
culty of getting to Oakland
during last week’s horrid
weather.

Advocate Editor—in-Chief
Elisabeth ‘ Preston said
she was very pleased with

the first issue, but she is
looking to expand the
contributions to the newspa-
per.

“What I want isia vehicle
for very diverse types of
groups,” Preston said.

Parks added, “It was truly a
great paper,” and encour-
aged new writers to come

and write to enhance the

quality of the newspaper.
Sharon Davis, the newly-
appointed GPSA resource
coordinator, was introduced
at the meeting. She said one
of her main objectives will be
to promote the Pennsylvania

Committee reviews

proposals

for former

Burger King location

By Stephen Kozarovich
Asst. News Editor

A committee of university
administrators and faculty
members are reviewing a pro-
posal that would bring a suites
hotel and meeting center to
Fifth Avenue between Bouquet
Street and Oakland Avenue.

The committee is currently
examining the proposal by
Crossgates, Inc., a developing
company located in McMurray,
Pa. The Crossgates proposal is
one of six which the university
originally reviewed and is still
considering, according to chair
of the committee James

Watters, assistant vice—chancel—
lor for Property Acquisition and
Management.

“We have a preference for
this concept,” Watters said. “But
what we’ve told [developers] is
we are not discounting any pro-
posal." -

Watters said that this is the
committees preference and not
a final decision. Currently, the
committee is attempting to
gather data and validate the
proposal.

The importance and immedi-
ate need for a hotel and meet-
ing center is not yet completely
known, according to Watters.

fun doing it.” _ .

As music filled the assembly
room, students, university
employees and others were
collecting leaﬂets and samples
from the numerous health
organizations that had set up

D table displays.

Representing the University
Counseling Center was gradu-
ate student Pam Lewis. The
Counseling Center was display-
ing information on eating dis-
orders. Lewis said, “We chose
body image because we _feel a
significant amount of college
students have eating disor-

.ders.”

One of their many objectives,

' Lewis said, was to provide stu-

dents with information on pre-
venting eating disorders.
“Hopefully we’ll ‘reach the peo-
ple and make it known that
we’re here.” A

Along with nationally known
organizations, such as the
American Cancer Society and
the National’ Kidney

. Foundation, were student-run,

health—related fraternities and
sororities.

Informing participants about
contact lens care, the Kappa Psi

Pharmaceutical Fraternity was

giving demonstrations on prop-
er lens cleaning techniques.
The Phi Delta Chi fraternity,
also consisting of pharmacy
students, was giving informa-
tion on peptic ulcers.

A representative of the
group, Jeff Fink, said that
smoking, alcohol and high lev-
els of stress are all causes of
pep-tic ulcers. “These are all

"parts of college life. Students

might think that only old peo-
ple get- ulcers, but [students

also are] at risk.” ' ~ -

To lure those in attendance
to visit their tables, most of the
organizations were offering

samples of different products. '

Many were health-related items
such as toothpaste or travel-
sized first aid kits, but some
were out of the ordinary like
the food coupons and salsa

job-hunters must step into
the interview room with their
V heads up.

“I want» to see someone
who’s excited and enthusias-
tic. You’ll have a 10 times
better chance of getting the
job,” he said.

“-If you aren’t convinced

' that you’re the best thing

since sliced bread, why
should I be?” ‘
Greeney said preparing for
an interview also requires
knowing both what one

wants to get across to the,

interviewer and how to think

, on the spot.

“If you’re ready for
that interview and you’ve
got 10 points you want to
get across, you’ll be able
to find a way to work
them all in somehow,” he
said.

Greeney said people
should not only show enthu—
siasm about themselves,
but about the company
and job they’re research-
ing as well. '

“You got that degree so
you can do what you want
the way you want to do it,”
he said. I ,

“Life’s too short to do what
you don’t want to do for very
long.”

“You don’t have to be that

‘good  just a little better

Greeney added.

New ESC President Victoria
Verbanec said Greeney’s visit
should prove beneficial to
engineering students who
need a little inspiration as

they continue their job

search.

“lGreeneyl did a really
good job ...he was very
dynamic and he had a lot of
interesting stories to tell,”
Verbanec said.

ing.”

Spec:/eing of intolerance

Twice within the past week, the Black Action Society
of the University of Pittsburgh has refused to allow The
Pitt News reporters to cover their events on the basis of
race. The first incident involved a black women
empowerment meeting. Two reporters were sent and

A both were turned away. One was told that only black

women would be allowed in the William Kurtzman
Room of the William Pitt Union where the meeting was
taking place.

The second incident involved a meeting advertised by
the BAS as a- general body meeting and forum onrthe
proposed black cultural center, an issue in which all
Pitt students have a stake. Two white reporters were
excluded from this meeting. When asked if a black
reporter would be allowed to cover the meeting,
Political Action Committee Chair Kelby Ritter said “I’d
carry her in.”

In addition, The Pitt News has quotes on record from
the Political Action Chair and the Public Relations Chair
saying that a black reporter would have been permitted
entrance to the meeting.

This is simply intolerable. No group picks and choos-
es what reporter or what race of a reporter covers their
meetings. What makes the incident truly appalling is
that this group claims to fight against racial intolerance,
yet they are propagating it through their own actions.

The same night the two white reporters were turned
away from a BAS meeting, BAS Vice-Chair Michael
Barge said in a Tolerance on Campus Seminar, “It
comes down to respect. When I treat you like I want to
be treated  that’s what it comes down to.”

Despite this invocation of the Golden Rule, one must
wonder how Barge would feel if he were told he could

A not do an adequate jobbecause he is black.

This situation is, in principle, no different than
another student group demanding that only white
males be allowed to cover their events because blacks,
women and other minorities couldn’t represent the
group properly in the press. .

The situation is only made worse by the fact the uni-
versity seems to be ignoring the issue. The non—dis-
crimination policy was clearly violated. ’ ‘

We would assume that at least one administrator
would have issued a formal statement about the exclu-
sion on racial grounds, but then maybe violation of the
non-discrimination code is not important to university
officials.

These incidents area clear violation of the universi-
ty’s non-discrimination policy. This is an obvious act of
racial discrimination What is lacking is an internal con-
sistency in BAS goals. To fight for the rights of only

' one group, while claiming to fight for equal rights, is

nothing more than racial intolerance under theguise of
racial harmony.

Censorship won't solve society's problem

In recent weeks, the major
broadcast networks and cable
stations have succumbed to
pressure from the misguided,
out-of-touch liberals in
Congress in the increasingly
ludicrous debate over televi-
sion violence. Rather than
stand up to Sen. Paul Simon,
the networks have compro-
mised, agreeing to monitor
their own programs to avoid
the threat of government inter-
vention in the matter.

Granted, some impression-
able youngsters may be prone
to emulate what they see on
television, but Simon, Attorney
General Janet Reno and their
cohorts have treated this issue
as though it is the most press-
ing social issue in America. In
an age of crack, AIDS, illegiti-
macy, gang warfare and drive-
by shootings, don’t “Walker,
Texas Ranger” and “Beavis and
Butthead” seem just slightly
innocuous? Not to these
humorless would-be censors.
They see these programs as
graphically violent and a threat
to society. ,

Using typically liberal logic,
Sen. Simon and company are

quick to blame anyone but the

criminals themselves for real-
life violence. Rather than rec-
ognize the need for stricter
prison sentences and mandato-
ry death sentences for drug-
and gun-related crimes,
Congress has pointed its finger
at the entertainment industry.
When television does inspire
its viewers to violence, it is
usually just one factor in the
situation, often alongside such
problems as a lack of parental
guidance, drugs, exposure to
crime in everyday life, etc.
Rather than attacking these
more serious issues, Congress
has attacked an easy target, as

though halting the depiction of
violent acts on television will
lead to a marked decrease in
crime.

The entertainment industry
has made itself an easy target
by caving in at the threat of
government regulation. In
doing so, the industry _has
given credibility to a group
that, in Congressional hearings
late last year, appeared com-
pletely ignorant of the pro-
grams they were targeting.

Examples of the industry giv-
ing in are appearing with con-

Michael
Gilbert

sistent absurdity.

Rather than stand up to pres-
sure to censor “Beavis and
Butthead,” MTV made itself
look guilty by bumping the
show back to 10:50 p.m. and
editing potentially “irresponsi-

ble” scenes from old episodes. ,

Some of the show’s finest

episodes have been taken com— 7

pletely out of circulation.

Panthers
stampede
Buffalo

By Ryan Buncher

Pitt men’s basketball
head coach Paul Evans
and center Eric Mobley,
good-hearted souls that
they are, let forward
Willie Cauley take
Mobley’s place in the
starting lineup as the
Panthers (12-4) visited the
University- of Buffalo, near
Cauley’s hometown of
Niagara Falls.

“Sometimes that's part 0

of Eric’s problem  he's
too nice,” Evans said.

Cauley’s start may have
also had something to do
with the fact that Buffalo
entered the contest at 5-
12 and was expected to
give Pitt no more than a
light warm-up for
Saturday night’s game
against sixth-ranked
Connecticut.

Despite getting only 15
minutes from Mobley and
zero minutes from nor-
mally-starting point guard

night was all the Panthers
got in a 97-59 pasting of
the Bulls. Cauley took

Lady hoops routes Providence, 90-72 in battle of Bi

Byjack Becker
Staff Writer

The reason the Pitt Lady
Panthers are so strong does not
ride with All-Big East
Conference performer jonna
Huemrich’s 18.2 points per
game or that they have weath-
ered a tempest of highly-ranked
opponents.

Pitt currently glides among
the conference elite because
somebody different regularly
stands up and guides the team
to victory.

The Lady Panthers shrugged
off early foul trouble with Erin
Maloy and Stephanie Petho ﬂy-
ing off the bench, scoring a
combined 56 points and lifting
Pitt to a 90-72 win over
Providence at Fitzgerald Field
House last night.

“After a win like that, I might
go back out and sit on the
bench,” Pitt Coach Kirk Bruce
said. 5

Presumably, just to keep it
warm. '

The Lady Friars (8-8, 6-5)
were left sputtering in the Lady
Panthers’ (13-3, 7-1) wake after
Pitt used a 20-3 run in the sec-
ond half that sealed the victory.

The Pitt bench again played a
crucial role in last night’s game
and nobody was as brilliant as
Maloy.

“That just goes to show the '

talent on this team,” Maloy said.
“Everybody pulls for everybody
else.”

By Keith Pompey
Staff Writer

Imagine you are at a University of Pittsburgh
basketball game. The Panthers are down by two
points and the opposing team brings the ball up
the court.

Panther head coach Paul Evans instructs his
troops to set up in the pressure
defense. That’s when Jerry McCullough steals the
show.

As “Ice” strips the ball from the visiting team’s
point guard, he races to the three-point line and
fires up a shot. It’s nothing but net, giving Pitt a
one-point lead. The Fitzgerald Field House crowd
has just erupted into a frenzy, causing the other
team to call a timeout.

As the Pitt band plays “Rock ‘n’ Roll, Part II,”
Paul Hipp, a season ticket holder since 1980,
leaps from his seat and dashes to the center of the
court.

After sprinting up and down the court, Hipp
moves his arm in unison with the beat of the
music.

At the sight of this man, one might ask, who is

this imposter?

Is he drunk?

Is he crazy?

But after hearing the chants of the crowd, “Paul
 Paul  Panther Paul  Paul  Paul  Panther

Paul," you realize that this 51-year-old Braddock
native is the one and only Field House rocker
himself.

years, has become the Panthers’ unofficial mas-
cot.

“He is so cute,” said Maria Fernandez, a sopho-
more from Greenfield.

James Matthews, a senior from Philadelphia,
added, “He gets me more psyched up than the
cheerleaders.”

Until three years ago, the only people Hipp
psyched up were the officials and the visiting
coaches.

“In other years, all I did was get on the refs and
other coaches,” Hipp said. “I hated Rollie
Massimino [former Villanova and present UNLV
head basketball coach]. He wanted to fight me
outside one night. He said, ‘Meet me outside the
game, you fat s.o.b.”’

To Hipp, just being a heckler wasn’t enough.

On Jan. 2, 1991, Seton Hall Visited Pitt. During a
timeout, Hipp jumped out of his seat when the
band struck up a catchy tune and added a new
dimension to it by swinging his arms up and
down bushwhacking style.

Now, after three years of leading the crowds,
he still doesn’t know what inspired him to do it.

“I don’t know. They just played that song one
day, and I just started doing the motions with my
hands,” Hipp said.

Since that day, with a little help from the Field
House Fanatics, Panther Paul’s antics have
become a game—day ritual.

“The Field House Fanatics saw me and made
sure I did it at the next game, which was at the
Civic Arena,” he said. “When they played that
song, they all told me to get up and do it. I just

Yooooo!!! What up my peo-
ples? (not a typo) Blakk’s back
in effect. This won’t be the typi-
cal DIT C because a lot of things
transpired since I've written last.
For example, there was a Hip
Seminar held at the

Masonic Temple. Except for the
attendance (lack of), it was a
pretty good discusion forum, in
which I was one of the panelist.
The main basis of the discussion
was the hip hop culture, rap
music and its effects on society.
Much respect goes to Vanessa
Lyles for her_ stance on the
whole “bitch—hoe” controversy.
I can’t remember everything
that was said,‘but do remember
that she had many valid points.
But the more I sit here the more
I think about how most black
women call each other "bitches’
and other derrogatory terms

faster than any male would; but
I don’t want to start that argu-
ment again.

The main topic of discussion
was Gangsta rap and its effects
on the Black community. There
was a lot of talk about how it's
basically the reason why the
community is so divided; it’s the
reason why there are guns,
drugs, broken homes and disre-
spect of self and others in the
community. After a long discus-
sion, and a couple of examples
from the audience (myself
included), it was basically
agreed that the problems stem
from the home, but the music
doesn’t help. It doesn’t really
add to the problem, but it
doesn't really help. The music,
believe if or not, is a form artis-
tic expression. The artists are
just that... artists. Most of which
do not lead the lives that they
portray on the records and
videos. This is Hollywood on
wax. You cannot hold a ficti-
tious figment of society respon-
sible for the ills that go on. It’s
true that sometimes they speak
of things that are true, but

“The Shot” was a phat intro.

skit were “Dr. I. Cube” delivers
a glock 9 tetinus shot to the
neck of “Mr. \X7hite.” “Lil’ Ass

Gee" is about a young boy _

coming up'as a gangster and
paying the consequences of
getting caught. “Cave Bitch” is
a phat joint talking about white
women scheming on him and
other brothers. “Ghetto Bird” is
also dope. “Really Doe” is also
starting to grow on me.

Overall (this is stretching it),
the album is O.K. His lyrical
style just isn’t what it used to
be. That “choppy” style of his
can be nerve racking at times
and doesn’t ﬂow like the style
of old.

Hopefully, when his contract

Dzmzbrocle Volume 5: Tommy
(In Seven Minutes)

Vital Music Records

In a time when tribute albums
are becoming a dime a dozen
(we don’t need a Hendrix trib-
ute album), this record comes as
a breath of fresh air. It functions
as both an homage to its source,
The Who’s Tornmy, and as a
parody of the tribute genre.

Side one features a reading of
the Beatles’ “You Know My
Name (Look Up the Number),”
which appeared as a B—Side to
the “Let It Be” single. The origi-
nal song showed the Fab Four’s
goofy side, which was normally
relegated to the Christmas
records. ,

The song features four distinct
parts which are interpreted here
by Fly Ashtray, Rats of Unusual
Size, Youth Gone Mad and Sea
Monkeys respectively. While
each band remains faithful to
the original section, the final
product might confuse listeners
unfamiliar with the original. It
doesn’t match the original, but
you really can’t fault it for that.

The record’s showpiece
comes on side two. Seven
bands deliver one—minute ver-
sions of. songs from The Who’s
Tonznzy, playing them just long
enough ‘(usually just one verse)
to get the point across and to

keep it amusing. Just as you get ,

used to one song, the next one
begins.

Many of the match-ups are
perfect. Among them Dogbowl
delivers a bouncy, clarinet—dri-
ven version of “Tommy’s
Holiday Camp.” King Missile’s
John S. Hall handles “Tommy
Can You Hear Me” with inno-
cent abandon. Artless manages
to throw a few bars of “The Kids
Are Alright” into the obnoxious
“Fiddle.About.” Alice Donut
performs an a cappella version
of “We’re Not Gonna Take It.”

Only the Lunachicks slow
things down when they trans-
form “Acid Queen” into “Kraft
Macaroni & Cheese Queen.” (I
hate it when bands wear their
trash culture upbringing as a
badge of hipness.) But it goes

" by so quickly it really doesn’t

matter.

It’s really rare to pay tribute to
one of the giants of music histo-
ry‘without making a fool of
yourself. Vital Music Records
has succeeded and managed to
get some cheap laughs in the

Luscious Jackson
In Search of Man ny

Grand Royal

After seeing pictures of
Luscious Jackson in CMJ a few
months ago, I had them pegged
as an indie rock band. The smil-
ing women had the bashful,.
innocent look of a band like
Tiger Trap, who play raw, fast
pop tunes.

I guess you really ‘can’t judge
a band by the way they look. It
was quite a surprise then that In
Search of Manny began with
sampled drumbeats and a
husky—voiced woman rapping
over them. Luscious Jackson —

alias Jill Cunniff and Gabrielle
Glaser — sound closer to dance

imusic than indie rock. However

the seven songs on In Search of
Manny sound more like pop
songs fused with elements of
rap rather than trying to come
off strictly as a rap band. The
packaging of the seven—song CD
throws you off as well. The two
unassuming photos of Cunniff
and Glaser are overshadowed
by the shirtless guy whose ane-
mic body appears all over the
insert. «

On first listen, Luscious

Jackson’s sound can be jarring
to the point of embarrassment.
But the CD has some moments
which merit further examina-
tion. They walk a fine line
between clever and corny, but
the women pull it off with
authority. Their breathy voices
sound convincing, and they
have good ideas about how to
experiment with styles.

The drum samples get a good
groove going on songs like “Life-
of Leisure.” The song sports a
thundering bassline and a repet-
itive clarinet which reach out
and grab you. “Daughters of the

Kaos” throws a siren sample ,

and acoustic guitar into the mix.

Ironically, Luscious Jackson
loses momentum on the songs
where they forego the samples
and become a four—piece band.
“Bam Barn” and “Satellite” are
built around simple dance
grooves which repeat ad nause-
um without any kind of hook.
It might sound good on the
dance floor, but it sounds still-a
born in the privacy of your own
home.

‘In Search of Manny sports
some high points, but in the
end it comes off half-baked. A
few of the songs would be per-
fect for your next party tape, but
I can’t imagine listening to it on

a regular basis.

St. Johnny
Speed 15 Dreaming
DGC Records

St. Johnny has come a long
way in a short time to their
major label debut, “Speed Is
Dreaming”.

Their first release, “I Love
You,” was on Ashma, their own
label. J

Then they signed to a home-
town label, Ajax Records, which
settled them into the successful
ranks with the “Go To Sleep”
seven inch.

Caroline quickly grabbed the
boys from Chicago’s streets and
had them record “High As A
Kite,” a collection of mostly new
tracks and their two previous
singles.

During their short stay with
Caroline, Sonic Youth’s
Thurston Moore called St.
Johnny -“his favorite band.”

DGC Records signed them
with Thurston’s backing. Bill
Witten, the lead singer, com-
plained about the comparison
with Sonic Youth’s sound, say-
ing, “...We.don’t sound like
them. Okay, actually we do
sound like Sonic Youth. Man...”

“I Hate Rock and Roll” and
“You Can’t Win” distinguishes
St. Johnny’s slower edge, a com-
promise between the English
shoe-gazing sounds andjsimple

rus,

pop music.

“Down the Drain”, “A Car or A
Boy?” and “Gran Mal” clearly
indicate a Sonic Youth’s
“Daydream Nation” influence.
While St. Johnny doesn’t deny
theircaffiliation with their elders,
it would be nice to hear some
more experimentation with the
songs.

“What Was 1 Suppose to See?”
begins with 20 seconds of feed-
back and a catchy guitar riff.
How nice. A little bit of the St.

Johnny and a little less of others. -

“The Devil’s Last Stand” is the
difference. Quietly using a
piano or moog during the cho-
they play a depressing
blues-like tune with Bill reﬂect—
ing on a divorced wife. (Bill’s
ex-wife lives somewhere in
Pittsburgh.) This musical atmos-
phere continues on the 16-sec-
ond instrumental, “You’re Not
My Friend.”

“Everything is Beautiful”
shows St. Johnny has some
depth with their pop tunes. If
DGC is going to have a video
for any of them, it should be this
one. _

St. Johnny has to untie the
apron strings of their mommy,
Sonic Youth. While they haven’t
left the nest yet, they have been
wandering away from home.

This is where City Theaters produc-

Women self—proclaimed underdogs while men hungry for revenge victory versus unbalanced 'Cats

By Sean Duncan
Staff‘ Writer

At last, the men’s and
women’s swimming and diving
teams are back in the friendly
confines of Trees Hall, and are
set to meet Villanova on
Saturday at noon.

Since the last home meet the
weekend of Dec. 2 (the Pitt
Invitational), the men’s and
women’s teams have taken sep-
arate directions which are
reflected in their outlooks
against Villanova.

The men’s team (6-1) is swirn-
ming with confidence and is
fully expecting a win.

“I would be lying to you if I
said we weren’t expecting a

_ win,” said men’s head coach

Chuck Knoles.

The women’s team (4-3) is
not so confident coming into
this meet against the defending
Big East Champions.

“We’re definitely the under-
dogs,” said women’s head
coach Marian Cassidy. “We’re
hoping to swim well, and if we
swim well, anything can hap-
pen.” ‘ —

UNIVERSITY STUDENTS.

The women’s team is coming
off a tough loss against Penn
State last weekend, but that
doesn’t worry Cassidy. What
worries her is there are some ill-
nesses on her small team.

“Hopefully they will come
around by the end of the week,”
Cassidy said “If we have the
guns to win the meet, we’ll wait
and see what happens.”

Although Villanova is the
defending champion, they are

very vulnerable to an upset.’

Villanova is a much smaller
team than last year.

“We lost a big class last year,”
said Villanova head coach
Chuck Horton.

“We don’t have the divers to
compete with Pitt.”

Pitt swimmer Candie Burke
feels the same as Horton.

“I’m excited about the meet,”
Burke said. »

“They pretty much crushed us
in the Big East Championships
last year, but seeing their
results, they are not

swimming nearly as fast. It
looks pretty positive from the
results.”

However, Villanova didn’t
lose all of their guns. Returning
star Lisa Flood was a NCAA
champion two years ago, along
with “other outstanding girls,”
said Cassidy. “But they are not a
deep team.”

After almost a two—month lay-
over from their own pool,
Cassidy and company are excit-
ed to be back at home again.

“We’re going to get up and
race,” said Cassidy. “We’re
going to enjoy being at our
home pool. We’re going to give
it a shot.”

“It’s always nice to swim in
our home pool,” Burke added.

The men’s swimming and div-
ing team have a little more than
competing on their minds —
they want to avenge Villanova
for defeating them in the Big
East Championships last year.

“We definitely have a score to
settle,” said captain Matt Brady.

“I’m going to swim with anger,
and I’m pretty sure that’s how
most people on the team feel.

"We’re excited to swim
against Villanova — we just
wanfto pound them into the
ground.

“Our job is to beat them by as
many points as possible.”

The reason there is some hos-
tility toward the Wildcats is
because for the first time in 10
years the Panthers, thanks to
Villanova, are not defending Big
East champs.

Ironically enough, four -weeks
before the Big East
Championships last year Pitt
clashed with Villanova in a dual
meet and won by 40 points.

Knoles likes his chances this
time around, better yet, he
expects a win.

“I’ve never lost a dual meet to
Villanova,” said Knoles. “I don’t
expect Saturday to be any dif-
ferent.”

Not only are the Panthers
swimming with emotion, but

they are clearly the better team.
Pitt has a lot of swimmers who
can swim different events com-
petitively, unlike Villanova’s
fixed lineup.

“We have a very balanced
team,” said Knoles. “They don’t
have that. They are strong in
some events and not so strong
in others.”

Plus, Villanova’s divers can’t
compete with Pitt’s so-far
unstoppable diving team.

“We don’t have the diving to
compete,” said Horton.

If things can get any worse for
‘Nova, Pitt is pumped—up to be
home.

“I’m excited,” said Knoles.
“The guys are excited. It will be
a homecoming of sorts.

"It will also be the same
pool that Villanova beat us
in.”

Last year’s loss is still fresh in
the minds of the men’s swim-
ming and diving team, and they
hope the results of Saturday’s
meet will reﬂect it. I

aging 3.4 points per game,
kicked off the Lady Panthers
run by popping a 3—pointer
that was the beginning of the
end for Providence. On the
Lady Friars’ ensuing posses-
sion, Tressa Bolfert — sub-
bing for foul-plagued Carolyn
Miller and Missy Thompson
—— poked an errant
Providence pass to Pitt guard
Carol Morton that started a
fast break.

Morton (12 assists) found
Maloy alone at the three-
point stripe once again and
Maloy burried her second-
straight trifecta.

“I was just kinda on and I
always seem to play well
against Providence for some
reason,” Maloy said. “Once I
get going I get my confi-
dence.”

“One of the key things
about Erin’s performance was
we got her the ball when she
was open. I don’t care who is
against her, she is not going
to miss very many when she
is open,” Bruce said.

“This is not something that
we’re shocked that she’s
done. E is capable of this.”

Pitt caged the Lady Friars
for the next 5:49, allowing
them only a three—pointer
from Jennifer Davis.

Providence watched the
Lady Panthers, roll along d_ur-
ing this stretch with Morton’s
coast—to—coast layup off a
steal, two three—pointers from

Jenine Joyce, four Huemrich
free throws and a Maloy
scoop-shot in the lane.

H

Chris Palmiero/The Pitt News

Stephanie Petho combined with Maloy for 36 points.

Pitt’s lead stood at 79-60
before the Lady Friars finally
scored again and cruised on
to the 18-point victory.

In the first half, the Lady
Panthers survived sour shoot-
ing from their top scorers,
Huemrich and Jill Colabrese.

Huemrich (three-of-nine
from the field) and Colabrese

(three-of-10) could not find
the basket until the second
half, but Petho dealt out 10 of
her 15 points to compensate.

With the Lady Panthers
leading 24-21, Petho scored
nine points — including a
three-pointer ——- to lead Pitt
into the locker room with a
39-30 advantage.

points and 10 rebounds.

“Willie came through and had
a great game,” Evans said. “He
hit the open shots and did a
good job rebounding.”

The three-point shot Cauley
displayed in junior college had
been absent, but he hit two—of-
three from beyond the arc last
night.

Rookie Sotiris Aggelou also
took advantage of the weak
competition to rediscover his
long range touch, hitting five—of-
seven threes on the way to a 17-
point night. V

Buffalo"s attempts to take
away Pitt’s inside game gave the
Panthers room to hit 11-of—2O

‘three-point shots.

r“lOur shootersl got good,
open three-pointers because
Buffalo doubled down and we
got it back outside to them.”

It was Orlando Antigua who
got the Panthers started, drain-
ing a three pointer and adding a
dunk to give Pitt a quick 7-2
lead. Pitt never looked back as
the Bulls only pulled within two
pointsonce the rest of the game
——- at 10-8.

Pitt built much of its 58-22
halftime edge on the three-point
exploits of Aggelou and Antigua
(three-of-four in the game from
three-point range).

“The perimeter shooting

Evans said. “We started running

It got uglier early in the sec-
ond half as Pitt quickly extend-
ed the lead to 21 on a baseline
move by Ahmad Shareef and a
three-pointer from Aggelou. By
the final minutes, the Panthers
extended their lead to  many
as 40 on two occasions —— the
first being a 87-47 bulge cour-
tesy of a fast— break bucket from
Jaime Peterson.

Peterson added to Pitt’s domi-
nance inside with 13 points and
four rebounds in only 13 min-
utes. Mobley scored only four
points, but grabbed 10
rebounds and blocked a shot in
his 15 minutes. Overall, the
Panthers enjoyed a 49-36 edge
on the boards despite the limit-
ed minutes from their two cen-
ters.

Pitt also continued to get solid
play from Shareef, who scored
10 points, grabbed five
rebounds and dished out four
assists. He joined Antigua,
Cauley, Aggelou and Peterson
in double figures.
