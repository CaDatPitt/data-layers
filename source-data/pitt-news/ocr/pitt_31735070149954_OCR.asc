 

Religion
could  
affect  

Romney

Gideon Bradshaw
For The Pitt News

Speaking at an event last Octo-
ber, a Baptist pastor who endorsed
Texas Gov. Rick Perry urged Re-
publicans not to vote for former
Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney,
saying that as a Mormon, Romney
was not a Christian but a mem-
ber of a “cult.” Perry later pub-
licly‘ disagreed with the pastor’s
statement. '

But according to a November
poll by the Pew Forum, a proj-
ect of the Pew Research Center,
the pastor is not alone. The poll
found that Romney’s membership
in the Church of Jesus Christ of

Latter-day Saints may affect his-

chances in the upcoming prima-
ries. However, should he secure
the Republican nomination, Rom-
ney’s religious afﬁliation would
probably not affect his chances in
the presidential election.

Susan Hansen, a Pitt political
science professor who teaches
how religion and politics interact,
agreed that voters’ religious be-
liefs would play an important role
in the approaching primaries. She
said that while primaries typically
have a low voter turnout, religious
voters could signiﬁcantly inﬂuence
the outcomes of the elections.

“I think you have to pay atten-
tion to who’s going to be voting,”
said Hansen, indicating the inﬂu-
ence that Christian conservative
organizations hold in Iowa. She
cited “a very large anti-gay mar-
riage group” as an example of such
an organization.‘ .

Before Tuesday’s Iowa caucus-
es, many commentators specu-
lated that Romney’s faith would
be a signiﬁcant factor for Repub-

lican voters in the state, where

 _ or on Thursday night

 by losing. “ .

Pitt has never lost four consecu-
tive games under head coachjamie
Dixon, but with Thursday night’s
84-81 loss to DePaul (10-4, 1-1 Big
East) in Chicago, the Panthers (11-
5, 0-3 Big East) did just that.

A 3—pointer by DePaul’s Moses
Morgan at the end of the shot clock
put the Blue Demons up 76-75 with
2:50 remaining in the game.

Dante Taylor answered witha
tip-in for Pitt and, after one DeP-

2012 SGB members sworn into office

Gretchen Andersen

Staff Writer

The gavel _has been passed.
James Landreneau was sworn
in'as’ the 2012 Student Govern-

. ment Board president Thursday

night by exiting president Molly
Stieber in the William Pitt Union’s
lower 1oungea;He and eight other
students will be responsible for
handling the Student Activities

Fund, which is over $2 million,_

that undergraduates pay 80 into
each semester.

More than 100 people, includ—_

ing Chancellor Mark Nordenberg
and other Pitt administrators, at-
tended the formal SGB inaugura-
tion ceremony. Students and fam-

ily members of incoming Board»

members welcomed the eight new
members; Natalie Rothenberger,
Gordon Louderback, Alex Mur-
doch, Zoe Samud2i,]ulie Hallinan,
Olivia Armstrong, Halim”Genus
and Megan McGrath.

Nordenberg congratulated the
outgoing 2011 Board members and
Stieber’s accomplishments. Nor-
denberg said SGB “led the way”
for talking about the state budget
cuts last spring with Pitt Day in
Harrisburg —— which had‘ its high-
est turnout yet -—- where students
lobbied congressmen to not slash
the higher education budget.

“I’m grateful to the 2011 Stu-
dent Govérnment Board, both
professionally and personally, for
their support,” Nordenberg said.

Nordenberg said Board mem-
bers should strive to make Pitt a

better place and that“‘building a J

better future always should be a

V priority.”

“When you are chosen to be
a student leader, for those who
elected you, you should work

. tirelessly to advance the greater

good,” he said.

Stieber welcomed'.La1_1dreneau
and the eight Board members
"while also extending gratitude
toward the outgoing SGB mem-

bers.

“It doesn’t feel like my oﬂice
anymore, and that’sa good thing,”
Stieber said.

After her farewell address,

« Stieber swore in Landreneau and

passed the gavel down to him.
Landreneau then called the new
Board members up to the podium

A and swore them in.

Landreneau, who said Thurs-
day’s inauguration was humbling,
highlighted each 2011 Board mem-
ber’s contributions and achieve-

ments. He said Stieber led with

great “patience and passion.”
Landreneau, who was elected

with 2,684 student votes — 67.

percent of the total — said he
hopes for the new Board to be
cohesive and approachable.
-“SGB has the'dual function of
allocating and focusing on indi-
vidual Board projects,” said Lan-

_ dreneau, who campaigned on the

implementation of an SGB liaison
system, a monthly campus hall
meeting and a student leader sum-

mit on campus.

Before leaving the podium,
Landreneau offered advice to in-
coming Board members to adopt
different projects that may come
along during their tenure in addi-
tion to working on their original
initiatives.

2011 SGB Board member Emily
Hoover saidshe is more excited
for this incoming Board than when
she was inaugurated last year and
added to Landreneau’s advice for
incoming Board members.

“Other student concerns
come,” Hoover said. “You must
listen to their stories. Don’t be
constrained with your projects.”

Kenyon Bonner, director of Stu-
dent Life and SGB adviser, said the
outgoing Board was “outstanding”
in accomplishing students’ goals
and staying attentive to student
needs, especially in regard to state
funding. Bonner said he looks for-
ward to working with Landreneau
and the incoming Board.

Evangelical Protestants comprise
a large power base withinthe GOP
— the group made up 60 percent
of the party’s turnout during the
2008 caucuses, according to a re-
cent article in the San Francisco
Chronicle. This proved not to
cost him the race; Romney won
the most votes, edging out former

Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum 

by only eight votes. ,
Jim Roddey, 78, chairman of
the Republican Committee of Al-

legheny County and trustee emeri— A

tus of Pitt, said he has heard only a
few instances where Republicans
have expressed misgivings about
Romney’s religious afﬁliation.
“There have been a couple
comments about it,” Roddey said.
“A few p,eople.._lM1ave* said, ‘I won’t
vote fo_ij_Rornney because he’s a
Mormon-.’l’f” ' ‘

:..a“"3

But'R'o  said he does

not considera candi_d_ate’s religious

views when voﬁngand has voted B

for Catholic,_]ewish,4Mormon and

mainline Protestant candidates,
‘has not ‘seen many voters in West-
ern Pennsylvania reject Romney as
a candidate because of religion. He
added that the issue might carry
more weight in the middle of
Pennsylvania, where voters tend
to be very conservative.

., The Pew Forurn poll also 
hat one-third ofall,Ame;r'i-“

  

rs believe that Mormons,
or members of the Church ofjesus
‘Christ of Latter—day Saints, are
a sect distinct from Christianity.
Among Evangelical Protestants,
‘a key power base within the ‘Re-
publican Party, that ﬁgure rises
to a little more than half.
Brennen Murray, 47, a member
- of the Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter- day Saints, called the view
that Mormons are non-Christians
a “misunderstanding.”

la “The Church’s name itself is the S

Church ofjesus Christ, and when
we pray, we end ourprayers, ‘in the
name ofjesus Christ,’” he said.

Murray is the president of the
4,200-member Pittsburgh stake
of the Church. Members of the
Church belong to wards, each
headed by a bishop, which cor-
respond to what other denomina-
tions call a “parish.”

A collection of wards forms a
stake — roughly analogous to a
diocese — which is headed by a
president. Presidents and all other

members of the Mormon priest-
hood are lay ministers and serve
on a voluntary basis. Murray’s
stake is one of two that include
parts of the greater Pittsburgh
area. A

Murray pointed out that visi-
tors to Mormon churches from

‘ other Christian denominations

see no difference between their
own beliefs and thebeliefs which
Mormons hold.

While the Church ofjesus Christ
of Latter—day Saints does not take
positions on political issues, the
Church encourages all members
to vote according to their con-
sciences, Murray said.

Discussing the role religion
plays in Americanpolitics, Rod-
dey pointed out that religion is
generally a larger issue for Repub-
lican than for Democratic voters.
Roddey questioned the sincerity

A of some of the candidates’ displays

of faith.

often misunderstood religion

“Some of [the candidates] do it-

as a protective mechanism,” Rod-
dey said. “They make that point so
they can appeal to the right wing
of the party.”

Hansen also said that religion

matters more to Republican vot-

ers than to Democrats. She also
agreed with the prediction of the
Pew Forum poll that whether indi-
vidual Republicans consider Rom-
ney a Christian or not, if he does
win the Republican presidential
nomination, Republicans would
overwhelmingly support him.
When Vice Presidentjoe Biden
spoke at Pitt in November, he said
it was “outrageous” that people

would cite Romney’s religion as a '

reason to not vote for him.

“I ﬁnd it preposterous that in
2011, we’re debating whether or
not a man is qualiﬁed or worthy of
your vote based on his religion,”
Biden said. I

“They are a diverse Board, with
different project ideas — a good
cross—section of the student body,”
Bonner said.

Pitt Police Chief Tim Delaney
echoed Bonner’s enthusiasm for
working with the new Board.

“Every year the Board appears
to get stronger and stronger. They
are in tune with the issues — es-
pecially the state budget,” Delaney
said. “This Board plus administra-
tion makes it easier to do my job.
We are all a partnership.”

The outgoing 2011 Student
Government Board members in-
clude Ryan Gayman,]ohn Hasley,
Hoover, Lauren Jentleson, Mat-
thew Riehle, Zach Weber, Alex

Landreneau is the only Board
member to be re-elected from the

This year’s election saw a 5
percent increase in voter turnout
from last year’s 19 percent turn-

‘a henchman’s work. According
to the San Francisco Chronicle,
police in the Fiumicino Airport
in Italy discovered ﬁve pounds

was “alluring.” Although we’re -

glad authorities apprehended the

THE MOUSTACHE COLUMN OF AMERICA

A total N eWYear’s    

 
  

Oliver Bateman
Columnist

Ah, rhere it_-comes —— a new. I

right now, anyway. What
matters is helping you devise
the greatest list of New Year’s
resolutions in the history of
mankind. Let’s start with the
most obvious category.

1) Weight: Whether you’ve
got too much of it or too little of
it, your weight needs to change.
Maybe you’re a puny shrimp who
desperately needs to hardgain
the freshman 15. Perhaps you’re
a dead ringer for the Michelin
Man but secretly aspire to the
rail-thin physique of a hip,
young singer-songwriter. Either
way, look in the nearest mirror.
Are you happy with the person

_whose likeness’ appears therein?
No, of course not. You don’t‘1ook . _

anything like all those celebrities

you know and love..Which—brings L
A - us to  V A

2) Hair: Your hair’s a hot mess.
People are talking. Do something
about it. '

3) Eyes: That color just _isn’t
working for you. Get tinted con-
tacts. V

4) Nose: Yikes. Take outsome,

‘ more student loans, and pay for‘

a rhinoplasty.
5) Personality: If you’re a real
know-it-all’, tone it down and let

other people talk. Feel like you-
’ don’t have anything interesting

to say? Wikipedia some cool new

facts about the Higgshboson and ‘

the GrandCoulee Dam that you
can slip into casual conversations
at the local coffee shop. Class
clowns and party animals ought
to take it down a notch; that act

 -~you?ve‘rtpped‘ofFfron1"hot college 

comedian Dane Cook is getting
stale. They’re not laughing at your

' more. Or our
: matter — but

a one reading this
it looks like thejoke’s on you. Shy

  akeover

 

 
 
 
  
   

jokes any-
jokes, forthat ..

hey, you’re the
column, so

boys and girls ought to put them-

- selves out there, mingle a bit and

feel unafraid to crack wise when
the moment strikes. Remember:
Nobody likes a=wallﬂower.

6) School: Man, last year was
so hectic. All that studying, all

I those exams  how on earth did

you survive? Well, our advice to
you is to take it easy next term.

‘Buy a PlayStation 3 and book a

nice long tripito Skyrim./Kick
back, eat a half—dozen $5 pizza
pies -9 an absolute must if you’re
following resolution No. 1 —— and
enjoy the show. "But what about
you slackers? Uh—oh‘, looks like
you’ll have to hit the books. Spend
some quality time at the library

with “y’6fi"r'Wii"’éless'signaliiisalileil,

attempting to read the texts you’ve

‘ purchased for all your ‘fblow-off”

and “cake” classes. That might
mean actually removing the clear‘
plastic seals and thereby halving
their resale value, but hey — the
one quality needed for resolving

all these resolutions is steely re—_

solve.

7) Relationships: Single, in a
relationship, engaged, married,
it’s complicated — regardless of

your status, you’ve got to shake I

things up for the mere sake of
shaking them up. Doesn’t it get
so darned tedious after a while?
Imagine going from being a bored,
lonely loser playing Madden 2012
in your tiny rathole of an apart-
ment to living the contented life of
a person with a signiﬁcant other
who watches your every move
and tries to sneak peeks at the
texts you’re sending to your other
sweeties. Or vice versa: ditching
your ball and chain, ﬂeeing that
domestic gulag where you’ve been
imprisoned for the last year and

getting back to a swinging single life of
playing Madden 2012 back in that awesome
studio apartment you used to rent.

8) Money: You need more of it, of course.
Otherwise, how will you pay for all of the
ﬁner things you want‘? And even if you have
enough money right now to buy some of
thoseiﬁner things, do you have enough to
buy every single one-of the ﬁner things cur-
rently availableon the planet? If you can’t
afford a rocket ship, death ray, street luge
track or solid-gold deathbed, you haven’t

reached your full potential. And even if
you can afford that junk, wouldn’t you like
to have enough money to ﬁnance the time
travel research that ‘would enable you to

‘ travel back to the year of your birth, thus

ensuring that there will never be even a

' single millisecond of your precious lifespan

where you weren’t the greatest and most
powerful person alive?

There you have it, people: a blueprint 1

for a completely new you, one that isn’t
half as lame and un—Bieberlike as the cur-

rent you. However, even if 2012 turns out

‘to be the year that you go from being gr4

to at least gr8,,perhaps even gr10 — it
won’t be enough. After all, 2013 is right
around the corner — a year away, tops —
and you’ll soon be required to reassess all
of the things that went haywire in 2012.
The same goes for 2014, 2015 and every
other year that rounds that corner. That
is, until they stop coming at all.

Ain’t life grand? We’ll take a cup of kind-
ness yet, for auld lang syne.

Panthers set for Compass Bowl

Pitt will face Southern Methodist in Birmingham on Saturday.

R] Sepich
Staff Writer

The Pitt football team will play
in the BBVA Compass Bowl on
Saturday under the direction of
an inter-im head coach and with-
out half of this season’s coaching
staff.

In the time since the Panthers
defeated Syracuse on Dec. 3 to
clinch Pitt’s second straight trip

to the BBVA Compass Bowl, f1rst- . —

year head coach Todd Graham
bolted to Arizona State, defen-
sive coordinator Keith Patterson
was‘ named interim coach for the
bowl game, and Pitt announced
Wisconsin’s offensive coordina-
tor Paul Chryst as the new head
football coach.

Pitt also lost co—offensive

coordinator and wide receivers _

coach Mike Norvell, who fol-
lowed Graham to Arizona State,
and tight ends coach Tony Dews,
secondary coach Tony Gibson and
co~offensive coordinator Calvin
Magee, who all joined the staff at
the University of Arizona.

But the turmoil of the last
month is familiar to the Pan-
thers. Pitt was also ‘coachless
when it entered last season’s
BBVA Compass Bowl. _ I

Following former head coach
Dave Wan‘nstedt’.s resignation,
Pitt hired Michael Haywood from
Miami (Ohio) and ﬁred him a

few weeks later after a domestic »

violence charge, leaving the pro-
gram without a coach. Haywood
has since entered a trial defer-
ment program, and the charges
will likely be dropped after he
completes it.

With interim coach Phil Ben-
nett leading the Panthers, Pitt
won the BBVA Compass Bowl
27-10 against Kentuckylast sea-
son. _

Now this year’s interim coach
Keith Patterson hopes the Pan-
thers (6-6, .4-3 Big East) can
-produce a similar result when
they face the Southern Methodist
Mustangs (7-5, 5-3 Conference

USA) at 1 p.m. Saturday at Legion .

Field in Birmingham, Ala.
“I told those young men I’m

going to coach, and I’m going to
prepare very hard for them,” Pat-
terson said at a press conference
following Graham.’s departure.
“We’re going to go,’and we’re go_-
ing to win. We’re going to finish
what we started.”

Senior defensive tackle Myles
Caragein said in a video on Pitt’s
website that he believes it doesn’t
matter who the coaches are —
it’s up to the players to win the
game.

“Coaches don’t go and win
games,” he said. “They put you
in good positions, but the play-
ers still need to go out and make
great plays to win the game.”

The Panthers still have quite
a bit to play for.

last time Saturday. Despite the
unprecedented coaching turmoil
they have experienced during the
last two years, a winwill ensure
that this senior class leaves hav-
ing never experienced a losing
season.

Junior quarterback Tino
Sunseri said in a video on Pitt’s
website that playing for his team-
mates and his school is all the
motivation he needs.

“Whenever you come to a
school, you come because you
love the school and the players
around you,” he said. “That’s how
my mindset is. I’m going to go
out there and compete as hard
as I can to win this bowl game.
We still have a lot to play for, and
we’re excited.”

Nix faces three

summary charges

Lauren Kirschman
Sports Editor

Pitt senior offensive lineman Lu-
cas Nix has been charged with
three summary offenses —‘crimi-

- nal mischief, disorderly conduct '

and public drunkenness — from
an incident that took place on

" Dec. 26.

Interim head coach Keith
Patterson issued a statement on
Thursday night saying that he
had just been informed of the
incident.

“Before any determination is
made on his status for Saturday’s
bowl game, I want to make sure I
have all the necessary information
about the occurrence to make the
right decision,” Patterson said.

“Lucas was not arrested and just‘

learned of these summary charges
tonight.”

Nix played in six games during
his true freshman season before

starting all 13 games as a sopho-

as a junior and began his senior
season at right guard before injur-
ing his knee in Pitt’s Sept. 29 win

He didn’t return until the
Panthers’ loss to West Virginia
on Nov. 25.

lead with 1:23 left on the
clock.

Two free throws from fresh-
man guardjohnjohnson gave Pitt
an 81-77 lead with 17 seconds left,
but Brandon Young quickly re-
sponded with a layup for the Blue
Demons. ‘

DePaul then fouled guard Isa-
iah Epps -—— a se1dom—used, re-
serve redshirt freshman — with
eight seconds remaining. With
the chance to seal the victory,
Epps missed both foul shots, and
Brandon Young drove unimpeded
to the basket for a layup and was
fouled.

He made the free throw to
bring the score to 82-81 with a
second remaining in the game.
After a failed long pass from the
Panthers, Young secured the win
and Blue Demon fans stormed the
court to savor just the second con-

ference victory for DePaul since
the 2008-2009 season.

Pitt — who led for the majority’?
of the ﬁrst half — can’t seem to
hold on to a lead this season and
allowed DePaul to crawl back into
the game in the second half.

Dixon started a new lineup
against the Blue Demons as John: .g

freshman Cameron Wright and
Talib Zanna started at center in
place of Dante Taylor.

DePaul started the game
strong, taking an early 6-0 lead,

and capitalized on Pitt’s sloppy

Panthers,

Jasper Wilson
Staff Writer

The Pitt women’s basketball team
expects a battle in the frontcourt

.,.against Syracuse on Saturday as
both teams look to earn their ﬁrst
win in Big East play.

Syracuse (11-5, 0-2 Big East)
leads the Big East in rebounds with
50.6 rebounds per game and in re-
bounding margin, grabbing 13.9
more boards than its opponents.

Pitt senior center Leeza Burdgess
said she relishes the opportunity
to test herself against Syracuse’s
frontcourt.

“It’s always a challenge,” Burd-

-gess said. “And it’s always ﬁm play-
ing good post competition and
just helping me getting better at
my game, my defense and seeing
where I am.”

Pitt head coach Agnus Berenato
knows Syracuse will come ready to

battle at the Petersen Events Cen- a

ter at 2 p.m. Pitt lost on Tuesday at
Villanova 70-62, while the Orange
are coming off a 55-44 loss to No.
10 Rutgers-.
“Last year, we had a battle up
8there at their place, and we’re deﬁ-
nitely looking to have abattle here,”
Berenato said. “[Syracuse] knows
that they’re 0-2, and we know we’re
0-2. Someone’s going to get a win.
Someone is going to get in the win
column.”
Syracuse’s strong inside pres-

Orange both looking for conference win

ence will challenge the Panthers
(8-7, 0-2 Big East), who are sixth in

the 16—team Big East in rebound-

ing with 41.3 boards per game and
12th in rebounding margin, pulling
down just 0.8 more boards than its
opponents.

The 0range’s frontcourt duo of
Iasia Hemingway and Kayla Alex-
ander, who average 15.6 and 15.4‘
points and 6.9 and 7.8 rebounds,

_ respectively, will keep Pitt’s interior

players busy.

Pitt freshman guard Brianna
Kiesel said the high level of Syra-
cuse’s interior play shouldn’t be di-
sastrous for the Panthers (8-7, 0-2
Big East). _

“Just because they’re strong in
the post doesn’t mean that our post
layers can’t dish out just as much,”
Kiesel said.

Syracuse also has weapons on

the outside. Guard Carmen 'I‘yson- '

Thomas averages 12.4 points and
8.4 rebounds.’ She’s coming off a

14-point performance against Rut-i ’

gers.

Berenato said teams often pos-
sess the ability’ to attack from any-
where on the ﬂoor in the Big East
and that she expects chaos in the
paint whenever a shot goes up.

. “Theywillgo overyourback,”Be-
renato said. “As soon as they take a
shot there will be ﬁve people clamor-
ing [for the ball]  [All ﬁve Syracuse
players]  be in the middle of the
paint. Sometimes they go over each

other’s backs. It’s unbelievable.”

Last year, Pitt lost to the Orange
69-60.

Kiesel has been Pitt’s standout
player of late, averaging a team-high
14.6 points, including a career—high
26-point performance against Vil-
lanova. ,

The freshman from Utica, N.Y.,
said growing up near Syracuse
doesn’t give her any extra incentive
to win, but she added that the team
as a whole is motivated.

“We’re all really hungry,” she
said.

Sophomore Marquel Davis is

the only other Pitt player averag- ‘

ing double ﬁgures with 11.1 points
per game and said she wants to see
her team challenge Syracuse.

“We just want them to go out and
compete,” Berenato said. “They re-
ally need to compete. We still have
problems in the beginning of the
game. That’s where we’re getting
down.” ,

Burdgess stressed the need for
Pitt tolcontrol the glass.

“We can’t allow them to get those
second-chance opportunities be-
cause the rebounds and their scor-
ing in the paint is [what they rely
on] ,” Burdgess said. “We have to take
that away and see if they can ﬁnd
another way to score without giving
them the second chances.”

The team knows what it needs to
do to get a win on Saturday. “We’re
going to_ ﬁght for everything,” Burd-
gess said. '

own production has suffered. He

but shot 5-15 from the ﬁeld and

]ohnson’s play was encouraging
. as he scored 10 points and shot 2-4

he could help fuel the Panthers’
offense in the future. .
Talib Zanna stood out in the
second half and went 8-8 from
the ﬁeld for the game, scoring

' "'16 points and grabbing seven re-

bounds.

percent from the ﬁeld.

Pitt couldn’t extend its ﬁrst-
half lead and build a comfortable
halftime advantage. Up 36-26 with
2:17 remaining, the Panthers al-
lowed DePaul to score ﬁve of the
half ’s last seven points and go into
the break with momentum.

Turnovers resulting from ill-
advised fouls and careless inbound
passes were abundant in Pitt’s play
Thursday night. Pitt sent DePaul
into the shooting bonus only seven
minutes into the second half.

The Panthers will look to
recover and pick up their ﬁrst

The Mustangs and head coach

ing season.

After a promising 5-1 start --
which included an impressive
road win against TCU — SMU
lost four of its next five games
and needed a three-point win
in the season ﬁnale against Rice

' just to make the BBVA Compass

Bowl.

While most of the teams June
Jones has coached are known for
their passing attack, this year’s
Mustangs boast one of the most
balanced offensive attacks in the
country. 1

mott threw for more than 3,000

yards and 16 touchdowns, junior
running back Zach Line rushed
for over 1,200 yards and scored
17 touchdowns, and receivers
Darius Johnson and Cole Beasley
each recorded more than 900
receiving yards and combined
for nine scores.

Saturday’s match-up will be
the sixth time that Pitt and SMU
have faced off.

The all-time series is tied at
2-2-1, but SMU fans will fondly
remember the Mustangs’ 7-3
victory over the Panthers in the
1983 Cotton Bowl, when both
programs were consistently
rated among the top 10 in the
country. ﬂ
