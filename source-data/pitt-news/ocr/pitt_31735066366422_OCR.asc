Searching For A” Unique Identity

  aGraduate Students Form Organization

More than 50 graduate ‘students
ﬁlled Dining Room A of the Stu-
dent Union Monday night at the

, ﬁrst organizational meeting of an

association of graduate students
at the University. Chaired by
Frank Kofski, graduate instruc-
tor of history, the group consider-
ed the" problems of graduate rep-
resentation on campus, the lack
of proper'intellec'tuaI atmosphere,
and the need of a social organi-
zationvoriented to the graduate.

Kofski began the meeting with
a short discussion of these prob-
lems, and tried to sum up the
feelings that." he felt prevailed
among the meetings. participants,
whom. he described as» “general-
ly appalled at the intellectual
tenor on the-campus.”

From then _ on the speakers
generally divided their remarks
between grievances resulting
from the University’s policies as
applying to graduates, and the

need to set up a social organiza-.

tion which would appeal to all
graduates in the University, in
all ﬁelds of study. ' .
The major complaints parallel-
ed those aired by the University’s
undergraduates during the. last
year. There were mentions of too
restrictive library ‘ hours. The.
prices at the. book store came un-
der attack, as several speakers
pointed out that the prices there

-are many times higher than‘any-

where else in the city. The poli-
cies concerning the dissemina-
tion of literature in the Towers
ywere also: questioned.

that the social rules in the honor
dormitories in Amos Hall, where
senior women» live, are Zcons_ider-
’ably more liberal than those in
effect in Tower C, the home of
more than 400 graduate students
and instructors. ._
‘However, ‘the problems of so-
cial organization seemed to con-
cern the graduates the most.
They emphasized the need for a
graduate lounge somewhere in
the University, a place where
graduates could meet and talk, ';
and more than anything else in-
tegrate themselves into a cohe-
sive body which would provide
them with more sense" of iden-
tity,

, With a total of 19 points, Chi

trants in the Spirit Award Contest
sponsored" by the Student Govern-
ment. The judging thus far has
been based on the pep rally of Oct.
28, the Homecoming ‘pep rally,
the Notre Dame football game,
and block ticket purchases for
the Homecoming concert.

nities: Alpha Phi Alpha, ﬁve

A somber note was injected
when a man who had been the
president of a similar organiza-
tion which had died out several
years -ago atthe University, re-«
viewed some of‘ the problems
which he had faced. Tatamount
among them seemed to be the lack
of administrative cooperation and-
lack of a meeting place. ' ’

Before adjourning, the group
setup three committees, titled
“Intellectual Conditions at Pitt,” 6
“Material Grievances," and “In-
terdepartmental Laison.” .It also
set up a provisional meeting at
9 p.m. next Monday in Dining

‘Room A in the Student Union.

By HOBART HARRIS .

The legitimacy of the Sai-
gon government became a
crucial area of discussion
during the Parliamentary
debate last Monday which
included two speakers from
Cambridge University on the top-
ic: “Resolved: That the United
States should withdraw from
Vietnam.”

Mahmood Mamdami, prime
minister in the debate, gave the
ﬁrst speech of the afternoon. His
thesis was that while the U.S.’s
basic policy in South Vietnam
was the containment of Com-
munist China, our policy of mili-
tary involvement has not accom-
plished this and cannot expect to
do so in the future. He gave three
reasons why he thought that our
involvement was wrong.

First, he pointed out that there
could —be no strong, viable govern-
ment in Saigon until the U.S.
withdraws. He observed that as

, it stands now, the U.S. has main-
tained a succession of. “puppet _

governments” in Saigon which
do not have the allegiance of the
population. And later quoted
President Eisenhower, who said
that in 1954 if free elections
could have been held in Vietnam,
80 per cent of the population
would have voted for Ho Chi

This line of argument led Mam-
dami to the stated that the Viet
Cong is the only legitimate gov-
erning body in South Vietnam.
Mamdami went on to contend
that not only is U.S. involvement
in Vietnam wrong in terms of
the desires of the Vietnamese,
but wasialso detrimental to Amer.
ican interests. He said that our

eﬁorts were just pushing Chi_

Mihn closer than ever before into

Communist Chiniafs orbit, forc-

ing North Vietnam to seek aid

and moral support from China in.

her ﬁght for South Vietnamese
liberation.

it withdrew from Algeria.”

zyv 2-1:-V ~

 

In answer to the argument that
U.S. withdrawal from Vietnam
would worsen our image, he gave
the example of France, which
gained respect “when it saw the"
handwriting on the wall and did
the honorable and moral thing-

Tuminello as ﬁrst negative
speaker, attacked Mamdami’s as-
sertions concerning the stability
of the American-supported gov-
ernments. Terrorism has made it
impossible to make any valid es-
timate of the real feelings of the
population, according to Tumi-
nello. The aid which the peas-
ants have been giving to the
Viet Cong could be largely the
result of their fear of the Viet

1 Political Initiation
I By Linda Goldstein

L Invading the smoke-ﬁlled rooms, armed only with two
University political science‘ courses and a dedication to the
-ideals ’of John F. Kennedy, I began my summer internship
with the Pennsylvania Democratic State Committee last
"May. ‘

’ Although I had been interested in politics since Ken-
"nedy’s nomination for the Presidency in 1960, my experi-
' ence had mainly consisted of serving as a
professional envelope typist and distributor

  
    
   
 
  
    
   
   
   
   
 
   
  
   
    
   
   
   
  
 
  
   
  
   
   
    
  
 

a real opportunity to view politics on a first-
hand basis. - . -
SOON AFTER I had arrived at State
Committee headquarters in Harrisburg and
met Otis B. Morse, chairman of the Demo-
   / cratic State Committee, I was given ‘my ﬁrst

extreme initiation. Matters could have been worse, though.
The local YAF organization had expected a few hundred
eople. All the unused place-settings in the room warmed
’"r'ny Democratic heart and counter-balanced the fact that I
{Was in the minority.
' ALTHOUGH IT was an effort to get through the din-
er, surrounded by enthusiastic high school YAF members
who reminisced about their days as Democrats and their
‘great awakening” by the Republican Party, the real crown-
g point of the evening was the speech by the “Outstand-
‘-g' YAF Member” who told what YAF meant to her. All
»; he self-control I possess rallied when she tenderly began
0 .describe her feelings for Barry Goldwater, but I demo-
jcratically refrained‘ from doing anything more severe than
‘wrinkling my nose. , .
Of course, that perennial rider of the YAF circuit, Ful-
on Lewis III, was there to attack such base programs as the

ar on Poverty and social security. And all the members
f the audience, which didn’t exactly resemble America’s
,..melting pot in composition, applauded fervently at his every
jutterance. No Negro was in attendance, but one high school
boy informed me that a Negro was an officer in his YAF
group and “he’s very nice.” -
C. After Lewis finallyoconcluded his speech and I was free
to flee from the confines of Conservative Anierica; all I
could do was sigh with relief that my summer would be
‘spent working with the Democratic Party, a party of action
and not of idle, unrealistic talk. I looked forward-eagerly
to dealing with a body that represented the constructive
programs of .the Democratic Party.

A Democratic State Committee in Harrisburg in the political intern-
ship program sponsored by the Pennsylvania Center for Edu-
cation and Politics.)

Alumni Director Robie

By MARK RAVENSCRAFT
Fred Robie, director of the University Alumni Associa-
tion, spoke at the last meeting of Men’s Freshmen Council.
Discussing some of the activities of the association,
Robie said that in 15 major areas from the east to the West
coast there are committees of alumni who encourage seniors
in high school to enroll at the University and assist those

r

who have enrolled. This summer
some of the alumni will help to
ﬁnd summer" employment for stu-
dents who would like work and
to earn money for their educa-
tion.

Robie explained the General
Alumni Council as a group which
has representatives from each of
the 14 separate schools within
the University. '

Robie said, “Alumniare giving

INTRAMURALS—NOT THE NFL

If the varsity football team wants some lessons in hit-

ting hard they should visit Schenley Oval some weekday
afternoon to Watch the intramural football leagues murder
' each other. Who said touch football was for girls?

There is not one play that occurs when. there isn’t an
elbow or unnecessary punch thrown. The games aren’t real
football games, but contests to see who can hurtthe other
guy the most. It seems that it is a moral victory if two or
three guys have to be carried off the ﬁeld.

Naturally, fraternity spirit runs high, and so does the
spirit in the dorms, the independents and the engineering
 leagues. This--is no excuse to send in guys to play on the
line who yell animal sounds or have rooters on the sidelines
“yelling—kill.” A

. the officiating and the intramural director Ron Mason, him-
self a referee, lets frequent violations occur which are visi-
bly infractions. The roughhousing that occurs is due to the
fact that the r'eferees can’t control the games.

In games this season players have dived at runners
passing by to tag them. This is illegal. Yet, the referees

f refuse to enforce this rule. If a guy fakes another man out

4. he still doesn’t get by because he is tackled.

The rule serves a purpose. It reduces injuries, and does

stop the game from being called tackle. Who wants to play

 football when you’re gouged, punched, elbowed, and kneed?
_ It takes the fun out of the game.

Mason should start penalizing violators and throw out
troublemakers. They’re not hard to spot. The champion-
ships for the all-campus trophy are being played and they
should not be marred by fights and illegal playing.

The fault doesn’t entir‘ely lie with the teams, but with

Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware District.
V be laid and then everything must go throughthe national chairman.”

All the. delay centers around
the selection committee’s deci-
sion to count only the games
played between qualiﬁed NCAA
schools when rating the teams
according to the Saylor Point
System./This means that the/vic-
tory (or the. loss or tie)~of an
NCAA team over a non-NCAA
team is discounted. Since the sea-
son is over for most schools, this
means that their entire schedule,
and the schedule of their op-
ponents, must be reevaluated.

“I don't know what they’re go-
ing to come up with, but it’s go-
ing to take them‘ a long time,”
said coach\Leo Bemis. “I can
see that no one, but an NCAA
Conference team should play in
in an NCAA tournament, but
now they havedrawn a ﬁne line
on who plays.

“It’s a matter of NCAA‘ regu-
lations, ‘but it’s getting rather
ridiculous when you not only
have to look at your own oppon-
ents, but who your opponents

A schedule,’,’ continued Bemis.
Under these regulations, two of .

the booters’ opponets, Frostburg

and Akron, are disqualiﬁed. (The -

soccer team has defeated both
teams.) . Also, the. classiﬁcation ' of
other schools on the boloters’
schedule may change, using the
Saylor system. '

“We may slip, but it’s my
guess that things will balance
out, and we will still be consi-
dered,” Bemis. said. “The main
question now is, ‘How many
games must count for a team to
be rated?”’ '

When Bemis ﬁrst heard of the
delay, he started to visualize next’

“We won’t know until Wednesday (today),” said Mel Lorbach, the chairman of the

“There’s-still a lot of groundwork to

is no use scheduling teams who
aren’t duly authorized members

“In the light of this, it is hard-
ly worth playing a team who
doesn’t play an NCAA schedule,”
he said. “

 Lovett Leads Cagers

In Scrimmage Opener

HOOP Page 7 pitt

In preparation for their season opener on December 1,
the Panther basketball team scrimmaged St. Vincent Col-
lege last week. While admittedly St. Vincent isn’t in the
same class as Penn State or St. J ohn’s, the Panthers played

a good game in winning 88-67.

Senior forward Bob Lovett,’ a man that the hoopsters

will be relying on all season,
scored 32 points and grabbed 10
rebounds. At the other forward
spot was last year’s frosh star
Ken Bollens who hit for 12 points
and asserted himself for nine
big rebounds.

self for nine big rebounds.

The Panther guards combined
for an overall ﬁne performance.
Larry Szykowny had 17 points to
go with Pete Smith's ﬁve stolen
passes. “Pete’s a real ﬁne‘defen-
sive ballplayer,” said coach Bob
Timmons. “Our guards are pretty
well set. We have (Stan Falen-
ski and (Roth) McNally to back
up the’ other two.”

Jim LaValley, who stands 6-6,
has a lot of potential. No one
denies this. As a sophomore last
season, he showed that he had
defensive ability. But the hoop-
sters needed oﬁensive punch
from the post’ and he couldn’t
give it.

“LaVal1ey hasn’t progressed as
much as we’d have liked,” Tim-
mons said. “He worked in a steel
mill over the summer and didn’t
get a chance to play ball too of-

ten.” Right now LaVa11ey is play- '

ing second string behind Bob
Thompson. Thompson (6-4) play-
ed forward for the freshmen
last year.

This Monday (November 22),
the varsity meets the freshmen
squad in a beﬁeﬁt game at the
Field House. Frosh coach Tim
Grgurich has the Cubs pointing
towards this one.

 

‘Key Injuries  Panther

    

. W nes ay,— ovember ,

Chances in Season Finale

Not only did Panther pride
take another blow last week-
end in California, their
chances to knock ‘ off Penn
State in the season ﬁnale al-
so took a dive with injuries
to several key players.

Mickey Rosoborough, Kenny
Lucas’ second favorite receiver,
wrenched his ankle late in the
game while covering a punt. If
Rosoborugh’s ankle doesn’t mend
in time, Bob Longo will prob-
ably see more action Saturday

than he has seen in nine games
thus far. In the few moments
that he substituted for Rosobor-
ough at USC, he caught four
passes for 50 yards.

Left tackle Bob Guzinsky is
another on the injury list with
an injured ankle. Even if he is
ready by Saturday his Ieg will
keep him out of practice for most
of the week. _ ’

Andy McGraw, who averaged
47.7 yards per —boot Saturday,
bruised his knee while tackling
Mike Garret. The injury isn’t
serious, however.

 If nothing interests you as much

as research and development. . .

consider the advantages of a career

in the laboratories of the

David Taylor Model Basin

The David Taylor Model Basin, one of the oldest government
laboratories, has grown steadily in size and responsibility and
is now concerned with design concepts for aircraft and
missiles, as well as with surface ships and submarines. Its five
major laboratories conduct basic, applied, and developmental
research in these fields:

HYDRODYNAM|CS—Hydrofoil craft, interface vehicles, novel
ship types, fluid dynamics, high-speed phenomena.

IAERODYNAMICS-Aircushion vehicles, weapon release
problems, V/STOL aircraft, aircraft performance.

STRUCTURAL MECHANlCS—Submarine and surface ship

structures, effects of underwater and surface explosions, ship ._

and personnel protection, deep-sea research vehicles.

APPLIED MATHEMATICS-—Cgmputer-aided ship and sys-
tem design, automated data processing, numerical techniques,
management data analysis.

ACOUSTICS AND VlBRATl0N—Radiated, near-field, self
and hydrodynamic noise, countermeasures, silencing devices,
‘noise transmission. «

An engineering or scientific career at the David Taylor Model
Basin offers you many advantages:

1. Because of the mission of the Model Basin, you can be sure
that you will be engaged in research, development, test and
evaluation not as a bystander, but as an active and increasingly
important participant. Whatever your discipline, you will have
the opportunity to apply it to one of the important projects in
which the Model Basin is engaged.

2. You will have the satisfaction and excitement of working
on projects that advance the state ofthe art and are ofnational
and international importance.

3. Working with you will be men whose engineering and sci-
entific achievements have earned them wide reputations in
their fields. Your contact with them will be of immeasurable
value in your own development as a professional engineer or
scientist.

4. You will work in a campus-like environment with 186 acres '

of laboratories and supporting facilities with millions of dollars
worth of equipment. For instance, the Hydromechanics Lab-

oratoryhas a Towing Basin'3/5 of a mile long, 50 feet wide,
and 20 feet deep; a Maneuvering Basin that covers 5 acres.
The Applied Mathematics Laboratory uses four high-speed
digital computers to solve engineering and logistic problems.
The ultra-high-speed UNlVAC LARC performs 250,000 compu-
tations per second. The Aerodynamics Laboratory is equipped
with nine wind tunnels, subsonic, transonic, supersonic, hy-
personic, for the testing of aircraft, missile and airborne com-
ponent models. Ten pressure tanks, and tensile and compres-
sive load testing machines are among the devices used by the
Structural Mechanics Laboratory in research on hull structures
for ships, deep-diving submarines and deep-sea research
vehicles. Mechanical generators in the Acoustics and Vibra-
tion Laboratory can produce known forces in structures rang-
ing from small items of machinery to complete ships. ‘

5. The management of the Model Basin is interested in your

‘professional development. It provides you with the oppor-

tunity to receive financial assistance and time (up to 8 hours a
week) to attend classes at one of the sixmajor universities in
the immediate area, which offer courses in virtually every
field. In addition, a number of graduate courses are conducted
at the Model Basin. Under a new program, several employees
are now engaged in full or %-time advanced academic study
and receiving full salary as well as all their expenses.

6. At the David Taylor Model Basin, you can reach the
$10,000 to $12,000 level within four years. In addition, as a
Civil Service employee, you get generous vacations and sick
leave, inexpensive life and health insurance, and enjoy the
benefits of an unusually liberal retirement program.

7. Within minutes of the Model Basin are the suburbs of
Maryland and Virginia offering excellent living conditions, un-
usual recreational facilities, and some of the best public school
systems in the country. Because the Washingtonarea is a cen-
ter for scientific research as well as for government, it boasts a
large concentration of people of intellectual and cultural attain-
ments. Washington, D. C. with its museums, art galleries,

libraries and points of historical interest is just 12 miles from

the Model Basin.

For more information about the David Taylor Model Basin and
the opportunity it offers you, see the interviewer who visits
your campus or write directly to Mr. S. DiMaria, Head, Office
of Civilian Personnel.
