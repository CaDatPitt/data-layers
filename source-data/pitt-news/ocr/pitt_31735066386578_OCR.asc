Presby purchase alters Oakland I

Byjennifer Spiro
Staff Writer

The Presbyterian University Hospital has
purchased a piece of land that will change the face
of Oakland’s business district, according to Oakland
Planning and Development Corporation.

The hospital has purchased the Iroquois Building,

 
 
  

because some people have moved out. Their lease
expired, and they chose to move. The vacancies are
there, not because nobody wants to do business
there, but because we’re holding the spaces. Existing
businesses that have to move [due to the
construction] are given first priority,” said Gleeson.

The reconstruction of the Iroquois Building and
the new medical center will beneﬁt the community,

which is located on
Forbes Avenue between
Meyran Avenue and At-
wood Street, as well as
the building’s parking
lot and the Atwood store
fronts up to and in-
cluding the post ofﬁce,
said OPDC commercial
development director
Rich Gleeson.

Several Oakland
stores, like the University
Beverage Center and
Forbes Home and Hard-
ware, had to relocate
because of this purchase.

“The reason that those

said Tony Detre, project
manager for the Iroquois
Building and facilities-
and support—services
staff associate for faculty
and staff of Western
Psychiatric Institute &
Clinic.

“The new constr-
uction is intended for
research and office space
for the hospital. It will
provide space for the
health center to grow.
The parking should help
solve problems for the
visiting retail stores, not
only stores in the

businesses are moving

is because the medical division of the University of
Pittsburgh bought that area of land,” said Gleeson.
“They are going to knock down those one-story
structures and build a medical complex and a

A parking lot.”

The existing Iroquois Building will also be
renovated, said Gleeson.

According to Gleeson, the stores which were
forced to move are receiving first priority in the
Iroquois building.

“There are vacant spaces in the Iroquois [Building]

building. There will be
50,000 new square feet of retail space for Mom and
Pop owned stores, which uphold the business
community," Detre said.

Gleeson said the OPDC is attempting to keep the
negative impact of the construction at a minimum.

“Traffic might be a negative impact, so Sennott
Street will be re-opened between Atwood [Street]
and Meyran [Avenue]. In conjunction with that will
be retail space. The majority of the parking lot will
be for the hospital itself, but there will be a number
of spaces of retailers.”

Pitt ROTC battalion, cadet 1‘€C€iV€ top honors

By Jenna Ferrara
Staff Writer

Pitt’s Army ROTC is the best medium-
sized battalion in the eastern seaboard,
and Cadet Lt. Col. Carlos Henderson, the
battalion commander, has been honored
as one of the best cadets in the country.

“We weren’t even in the running last
year,” said Lt. Col. Michael Geoghagan,
professor of military science. He credits
the battalion’s rapid improvement to
“increasing the tempo of training and
forcing the cadets to take charge of their
lives.”

“We told the MSIVs [senior cadets},

‘You're going to be second lieutenants in
a few months — now act like one. Draw
a training plan up and carry it out,’” he
said.

The ROTC program elevated the training
standards and forced everyone to meet
them, according to Geoghagan. “It sure
paid off.”

Physical training was also emphasized.
“We took PT tests every month — we still
do — and looked at individuals who
needed work, and we pushed them to
meet standards,” Geoghagan said. “That
worked real well.”

Pitt won the MacArthur Award, which is

presented yearly to the best battalion in -

Activist says staaent

each region of the Cadet Command. Pitt is
located in the first region, which
encompasses the eastern seaboard from
Maine to North Carolina.

Schools were evaluated on criteria such
as the cadets’ grade-point averages, their
scores at summer training camp and their
physical-training scores.

Pitt competed against 90 other schools
with 150 to 200 cadets. The Massachusetts
Institute of Technology was the second-
place school, and Campbell University
(NC) was third.

The United Services Automobile
Association, an insurance company for
military officers, gave Henderson a $1,000

scholarship and an engraved clock. One
cadet in each of the four regions was
awarded, said Geoghagan.

“So Carlos can say he’s one of the top
four cadets in the country," Geoghagan
said. As there are over 21,000 cadets in the
United States, “that’s not such a bad
accomplishment."

Geoghagan is proud of Carlos and his
twin brother Carl, also a cadet. “They’re
the dynamic duo," he said.

“Really, I’m proud of all the kids —
they’re not really kids; they’re young men
and women,” he said. “We're just going to
keep getting better and better."

resistance only way to stop war

By William Graves
Staff Writer

Nationwide student resistance
to U.S. militarism in the Middle

’ East is the only thing that can

stop a war with Iraq, according
to Vincent Eirene, a local activist
for peace. Eirene spoke at Pitt
last night with Indiana University
of Pennsylvania Professor Omar
Eomadfai, who is a current citizen
of Libya.

“I've stopped my war, now it's
time to stop yours,” Eirene said.

A student movement that died
down after the the Vietnam War
in 1975 must be reorganized in
order to prevent a confrontation

in the Middle East, Eirene said.
“The student movement will
be fueled by the impatience of
youth,” he said.
According to Eirene, the need

for a movement is even greater ,

now than in 1968. “This is not
Vietnam, this is World War III,”
he said.

He said that instead of reducing
production at the end of Vietnam,
munitions factories more than
doubled production. The United
States has supplied weapons to
countries all over the world since
then, according to Eirene.

“I am truly sorry. Your world is
much more sick than mine, We
have handed you a thousand

Vietnams,” Eirene said.

Students must also protest
American business, whose int-
erests, he said, are the only ones
that will profit from war and opp-
ression. According to Eirene, the
biggest obstacle to student in-
volvement in protesting against
these big business subsidies is in-
tense competition in workplaces.

“The companies that subsidize
apartheid are the very ones that
students are going to work for,”
Eirene said. “The world does not
need doctors, lawyers, or even
teachers; it needs people to fight
against poverty and militarism.”

Eomadfai stressed that a
military buildup in Saudi Arabia

could have been prevented , and
should never have happened.
The U.S. has not established
priorities, according to Eomadfai

“More important to the United
States should be our social
problems and economic
corruption,” he said.

Eomadfai said that the way in
which the U.S. got militarily
involved in the Middle East leads
him to believe the Iraqi invasion
of Kuwait was a U.S. set-up. “As
soon as Iraq went into Kuwait,
the U.S. ambassador to Iraq told
them that they had no agreement
to protect Kuwait. According to
Eomadfai, this gave Iraq full
license to set themselves up in

Kuwait. Then, he said, the United
States condemned Iraq’s actions. ”I
strongly believe that this was a
plan to destroy Iraq,” he said.

Eomadfai doubts the U.S.
government's reported concern
for the Kuwaiti people living
under Saddam Hussein.

“If they want to help the Kuwaiti
people, then why don’t they want
to help South African blacks?” he
asked.

He also expressed concern for
the hostages in Kuwait, but added
that “Palestinians have been hos-
tages for many years. Where is
their [United Nations] Security
Council? Why is there this
contradiction?”

Separation of Church and State necessary

By Mark Smith
Sta_ﬂ‘lVrlter
First Amendment, U.S.
Constitution

Congress shall make no law
respecting an establishment of
religion, or prohibiting the free
exercise thereof  (better known
as the Establishment Clause of
the First Amendment)

As the religious winter holidays
approach, one can appreciate the
above words from our First
Amendment. The Constitution’s
framers intended these words to
protect religious freedom and to
prevent government involvement
with religions. They realized that
when government becomes in-
volved with religion, it can control
religious belief or even suppress
it Most church leaders respect
the First Amendment’s wall of
separation of church and state.

The FirstAmendment prohibits
our government from supporting
or endorsing, or in other words,
establishing any one religion or
all religions. The wall of sep-
aration was considered the best
way to protect religious freedom
or freedom from religion.

Also, Article VI of the Con-
stitution supports the separation
theory by mandating that mem-

  

bers of Congress may be sworn
into office with a religious “oath”
or a non-religious “affirmation.”
Question:

Is the wall of

separation necessary? Doesn’t
it hurt religion?

Answer: No. The wall of
separation creates a standard that
all religions are treated equally
— the government has a duty to
maintain a hands—off policy.

Separation is important for a
variety of reasons. The Puritans,

who ﬂed England’s religious
persecution, established the

Massachusetts Bay Colony and

created a state-sponsored religion
Catholics, Quakers and other
religious groups were considered
heretics and could face the death
penalty. Although this example
is extreme, imposing a gover-
nrnent-endorsed religion or reli-
gions threatens the religious rights
of those not included. V

Q: Are religious displays on
public property during the
holidayseasonoonstitutional?
A: Individuals or businesses can
have religious displays; however,
when government enters the
picture, the government appears
to be endorsing religion and
violating the Establishment
Clause. In a 1989 Supreme Court
case, ACLU et al. vs. Allegheny
County, the American Civil
Liberties Union and an
interdenominational group of
citizens challenged the county’s
display of a nativity scene in the
county courthouse. The court
ruled that the display violated the
Establishment Clause; however,
it allowed a menorah erected in
front of the City—County Building,
to remain for the holiday season
because it was next to a secular
object, a Christmas tree. In the
past the court has upheld religious
displays if they were displayed
with non-religious items.

Q: Did the Supreme Court ban
school prayer?

A: No. In two landmark decisions
in 1962 and 1963, it was ruled
that the government cannot write
or sponsor prayers, Bible readings
or religious observances in
schools because schools are gov-
ernment institutions. Legislators
have attempted to circumvent
the Establishment Clause to
placate large denominations, and
in the aftermath of the court
rulings, some states mandated
moments of silence. However,
the court has interpreted the intent
of the legislators as the creation
of state-sponsored prayer and
has ruled moments of silence
unconstitutional.

Q: IfPitt receives state funding,
are religious groups allowed
on campus? Is this state
sponsorship of religion?

A: Religious organizations are
permitted to be certified with the
student government. However,
certain restrictions apply. They
cannot apply for funding for the
following: “religious retreats, ser-
vices, instruction and the like.”
Since the university maintains a
distance from all Pitt student
groups, it doesn’t appear to be in
violation of the Establishment
Clause.

considers its new location to be
better suited for its business.

“The university bought the
building we were in — the
university kicked us out — but
we needed a bigger store. We
would have moved anyway. We
tripled the size of our cooler and
doubled the floor space. Now
you can get cold beer,” he said.

According to Gary Napotnik,
owner of the Soap Opera
laundromat, the university has
treated his business very well.

“They’ve done everything they
could to satisfy our needs while

we’re trying to relocate.
Fortunately, I’ve been able to
relocate. The timing they

proposed has worked out,"
Napotnik said.

Soap Opera will be moving
from Atwood Street to Semple
Street. “I think it’s off the beaten
path, but my feelings are, once

we’re settled, people will know
where we are,” Napotnik said.

Forbes Home and Hardware,
formerly Forbes Variety, has
moved off Atwood and into the
Iroquois Building.

Store owner Dee Repic said
that the move will be proﬁtable
for the store.

“This location will be better for
us —— [Atwood] Street is dying.
We should have business here
after this building is renovated.
Business brings business,” she
said.

Other businesses, such as Job
Links, are not disrupted by the
move.

“We're not being affected by
the move. We were here only
temporarily, but we knew that
when we came in. They’ve been
very cooperative — it’s not
bothering me,” said Joanne
Fountain, a staff worker for Job
Links.

United Nations must help. ..

In 1961 Joseph Heller wrote Catch-22, a novel about
American soldiers involved in a no—win situation. Now,
this country faces this same dilemma, only on a much
more dangerous level.

At this moment the United States currently has 250,000
troops in Saudi Arabia, with 200,000 more on the way.
President Bush is attempting to send a signal to Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein by threatening military force to
get the Iraqi army out of Kuwait.

When the Iraqis invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, virtually the
entire world immediately condemned Hussein for his
aggressive actions. It attempted to shut down the Iraqi
economy with sanctions, barring all countries from doing
business with Iraq.

In all, a total of 26 nations eventually sent troops into
Saudi Arabia in an attempt to show their support for the
Saudis. Many other nations, including Germany and
Japan, sent money to aid the efforts of this peacekeeping
force.

But their efforts, compared to the one by the United
States, have been minimal. The United Nations has done
little to sanction military force under its command or by
anybody in the region. Now the United States must beg
to the United Nations to get the sanction to use its own
military force.

However, the United States would not be in this
situation had the United Nations done more to send
troops to the Persian Gulf in the first place. They have
done little more than observe as the United States has
played the role of Gulf police officer.

As the United States will soon have a total of 450,000
troops in Saudi Arabia, the other 25 nations combined will
have less than 100,000. This is a gross imbalance of troops
in a situation which involves every country in the world.

Arab nations tried to settle the conflict themselves by
sending their own multinational peacekeeping force. This
force, however, was more symbolic than powerful, with
less than 50,000 troops total — a token force against the
hundreds of thousands of Iraqi troops on the Saudi
border.

The United Nations, as a world arbitrator, must send
more troops to help the United States defend Saudi
Arabia. It needs to play a larger role in resolving this crisis,
whether peacefully or otherwise. If it does not, our
country could end up fighting virtually alone in a battle
whose consequences will affect all countries, large and
small.

The world wants to resolve this situation quickly. Yet
countries do not want to suffer the consequences should
war break out. The United Nations must combine its
forces to help the United States battle its war.

 

Be thankful for representation

On Nov. 15 representatives of
the Black Action Society stormed
out of an open meeting of the
presidential-search committee
after disrupting the forum with a
thrice—read letter and a shouting
match, led by BAS officer Justin
Laing, against Student
Government Board Piesidentjulie
Shepard. The demand, delivered
along with a thinly veiled threat
of violence, was for t_h_nee §,tu$,r_1_t§
named by the BAS to join
undergraduate Lisa Campoli on
the search committee.

Prior to this the BAS demanded
the outright resignation of
Campoli; the reasons given were
that “from our point of view only
whites and possibly white women
will have representation on the
presidential— search committee."
The BAS pointed out that Campoli
doesn’t know any members of
the BAS and so cannot represent
it or its concerns. The BAS also
brought up the fact that Campoli
is only a sophomore and that
Shepard has only been in office a
short time, to apparently
disqualify Campoli for the post
she holds.

I believe that these moves by
the BAS represent little more than
cynical power-jockeying. Looking
at the big picture, it seems
apparent that the administration’s
decision to allow one graduate

 

Rob
Lewis

and one undergraduate student
on the search committee was
justified and that Shepard’s
appointment from within the SGB
was a necessary, if politically
unpopular, move.

Many colleges and universities
conduct the searches for new
presidents and Chancellors
without any student input
whatsoever. They allow
representation by civic leaders
and business ﬁgures because of
the impact a university can have
upon a town, but they choose
not to listen to what they may
consider the immature opinions
of the students. Pitt's last search
for a leader, which began in 1965
and eventually culminated in the
hiring of Wesley Posvar, included

no students at all, whether
undergraduate or graduate, BAS
or non-BAS.

Viewed in this light, perhaps
the decision to allow student
representation on the committee
is quite progressive. And it is
evident why the decision on how
to choose the representative was
left to the SGB. It is, after all, our
elected student government and

gs su s}l11oulld have a clearer‘
viewlb t.he9lle <i§°i’f'ld’viE'€1‘§"6f”

the student body as a whole,
instead of those of a selected
special—interest group. The
decision to choose the
representative independently,
without a group of candidates
and a general election, was also,
unfortunately, a necessary one.

If nominations were accepted,
every special- interest group on
campus would have put forth a
candidate. The person eventually
selected would therefore
probably not have been a fair
representative but one naturally
biased toward the group or
interest he or she was nominated
by. The representative would be
a symbol of the divisions on
campus instead of a mouthpiece
for the concerns all students have.

Rob Lewis is a columnist for
The Pitt News.

Students treated like garbage

After having a problem with one of my professors,
I was advised to bring the matter to the attention of
the dean’s office. Since I am in [the College of Arts
and Sciences], I called their OfﬁC€ and made an
appointment to meet with a clean. I was pleased

that the dean’s office was
interested in meeting with me, a
student who had a legitimate
problem involving a course.

My appointment was with

Associate Dean Wilbur E. Deskins. After explaining
the problem several classmates and I have, he
responded with a terse “That's the way it is!” I
further expounded on the urgency of our problem,

Letters

but my words fell on deaf ears. Then, to my dismay,
he rose from his desk and headed for the door. I
then said that I thought we had not solved the

problem and that he had not heard one word I said.
He then showed me the door and said, “This
meeting is over, sonny.”

I just wanted to share this experience with other
undergraduates. It is sad to see this great university

tainted by administrators who
are unsympathetic and indifferent
to students’ academic concerns.
I feel this nonchalant attitude is
further reﬂected by allowing only

one undergraduate on the presidential-search
committee. I hope that whoever is named president
will not tolerate the callous bureaucracy that is
present in some university administrators.

It took Galileo 16 years to master

You have one night.

It seems unfair. The genius had all that time. While you have a few
short hours to learn your sun spots from your satellites before the
dreaded astronomy exam.

On the other hand, Vivarin gives you the deﬁnite advantage. It helps
keep you awake and mentally alert for hours. Safely and conveniently. So
even when the subject matters dull, your mind will stay razor sharp.

If Galileo had used Vivarin, maybe he could have mastered the solar
system faster, too.

Whether it was an expert judge
of talent or just plain ol’ hometown
favoritism, The Pitt News has
chosen the Panther basketball
team to regain the Big East
Championship for the 1990-91
season.

Pitt outdistanced Georgetown
and Syracuse in The Pitt News‘
Preseason Big ‘East Basketball
Poll. The Panthers gathered ﬁve
of the nine ﬁrSt—place votes, giving
the Panthers a comfortable edge

over the Hoyas and the
Orangemen (two first-place votes
each). Points were awarded on a
9-8—7—6—5-4-3-2-1 basis, depending
on predicted order of ﬁnish.

1) PITTSBURGH (77 points)
For Paul Evans and the Pitt
Panthers, this has got to be the
year
Three years ago Pitt was blessed
with arguably the best recruiting
class in Big East history. As

sophomores, Bobby Martin, Jason
Matthews, Brian Shorter, Darelle
Porter and Sean Miller became

‘full-time starters, and the future

of Pitt basketball looked bright
and glorious.

But it hasn’t been. Ball State
sent Pitt packing in the first round
of the NCAA Tournament in 1989,
and last year the Panthers ﬁnished
12-17 and watched the March
Madness on television.

Now they are seniors (except

Pitt preseason favorite to come out tops in Big East

for Miller, who was redshirted
last year), and it is time for the
Panthers to roar.

Shorter, an All—Big East
forward, is an inside scoring
and rebounding machine, and
when Martin has a good game
at center, he and Shorter can
dominate the baseline.

Matthews and Porter give Pitt
the best perimeter game in the
conference, andwithMillerback
to run the ﬂoor at point guard,
the offense should be explosive.

Last year, when Pitt's starting
five needed a rest, Evans gave a
long, hard look down the bench
and didn’t see much.

Only center Darren Morn-
ingstar was a constant
contributor

Pitt was a tired team that lost
a step on defense late in the
game and let a lot of leads slip
away.

This year should be different.
Freshmen Omo Moses, Ahmad
Shareef, Jermaine Morgan and
Tim Glover can fill in at guard,
and junior Antoine Jones,
sophomore Chris McNeal and
freshman Gandhi Jordan give
Pitt the bench depth it‘
desperately needs to make Pitt
tops in the Big East.

2) GEORGETOWN (69)
The Georgetown Hoyas enter
the 1990-91 Season with

expectations of being one of the
top teams in the Big East and
among the top 20 teams in the
nation.

,‘."\

Most of those expectations ride 9.
on the very high Shoulders of the

only returning starters on the Hoya
roster, 6—foot—10 center forward
Alonzo Mourning and 7-2 center
Dikembe Motumbo. Mutombo and
Mourning were the Big East Co-
Defensive Players of the Year last
season.

Mourning was a first team All-
Big East selection last year, and ‘

Mutombo made the second team.

The Hoya problem is a lack of
experience at the other Spots
because of the graduation of
Dwayne Bryant and Michael
T illmon and the transfer of David
Edwards.

The Hoyas do have two good

times last year but were

Asst. Sports Editor

Last year the .Pitt basketball
team suffered a major blow when
it lost Sean Miller for the season.
Miller’s congenital ankle condition
was slow to heal after surgery,
and there was even question as
to whether he would ever play
for the Panthers again.

Not to worry. Not only is Miller
going full speed in practice and
saying his ankle has never felt
better, he could be the healthiest
player on the team right now.

“I think Sean is the only one
here who hasn’t missed a day of
practice,” said Pitt Coach Paul
Evans, referring to Brian Shorter
(enzyme infection), Bobby Martin
(slightly sprained ankle) and Chris
McNeal (groin pull, tendinitis),
who were also in the room at the

Miller was redshirted for the
1989-90 season after having
surgery last November to repair a
partial fusion of two tarsal bones
in his left foot. As a result of years
of pounding on blacktops and
gym floors, the two bones rubbed
together and created an arthritic
condition in the ankle. Dr. Freddie
Fu grafted the two bones to
prevent them from rubbing
together.

Miller started playing again last
June but didn’t really test the
ankle until the Panthers started
practice Oct. 15.

“It feels great. I can’t' wait to
play again,” said Miller. “[The
ankle] is at 100 percent. At the
start of practice I thought it was,
but two weeks later, it still seemed
like it was getting better.”

That can only mean good things
for the Panthers. In Miller’s
absence last year, Pitt struggled
to a 12-17 record, missed the

 : postseason for the first time since

1983 and had its fewest wins

I since 1977.

Miller’s passing and long—rang
shooting last year, they just plain
missed a healthy body. The

bedraggled Panthers lost six of 

their last eight games, with only

two wins against last—place Boston 
College during that stretch to if

prevent a total collapse.

This year Miller returns to his
starting point—guard spot,
relieving Darelle Porter, who set
Pitt’s single—season (229) and
career (449) assist records while
filling in for Miller at that position
last year.

Although that move might seem
open for debate because of
Porter’s success, most agree it is
not. Porter moves to shooting
guard but will likely split time
among the two positions with
Miller and Jason Matthews.

Miller averaged 9.5 points and
5.9 assists his first two years and
is third on the the Big East’s
career three—point accuracy list.

Miller was part of Pitt’s best
recruiting class ever four years

It’s always something.

If Paul Evans doesn’t have Sean
Miller’s foot to worry about, then
he has Brian Shorter’s viral
infection to contend with. Shorter
missed the first four weeks of
practice, starting Oct. 15, and he
has seen his blood enzyme count
rise to dangerous levels on several
occasions. As a result, he has
suffered severe fatigue and is
considerably behind physically
at this early point in the season,
according to Evans.

It seems ironic that Shorter’s
immune system failed him at such
an early stage this year. It may
have been more apropos if he
had been stricken with this
infection toward the latter half of
last season when he played the
full 40 minutes on six different
occasions and at least 38 minutes
nine different times. Shorter was
one of only seven players to see
substantial action last season in a
year marked by a substantial lack
of depth up front.

Not having your top player at
100 percent at the beginning of
the season — where nearly every
major publication in the country
has Pitt in the top 20 -— is a
serious cause for concern. Add to
that the added pressure of being
picked to win the Big East as well
as going deep into the NCAA
Tournament (which everyone
involved in the basketball

' . - ‘R \- «."I" '“q1r>:'\wv 'n'w‘1.”¢_'s' 'zWn‘~.~rrA’ ‘1'$"a.'r ‘ht"‘~."

THE prrr  prrr HOOPS, November 27, 1990

Shorter fills tall order for Pan

program will tell you they never
think about), and the Panthers
may have their work cut out for
them initially.

“My tirr1ing is off with grabbing
rebounds and my leaping ability.
It’s going to take me a little while
to get my footwork back and also
my quickness off the floor,”
Shorter said.

In practices during the week of
Nov. 19, Evans said the gap
between the veterans and the
newcomers was beginning to
widen. The Pitt team of old, Miller,
Darelle Porter, Jason Matthews
and Bobby Martin, was beginning
to solidify, with one exception.

“Brian was a little tentative,
unsure of himself and what he
could do,” Evans said. “I took
him from practice and made him
do some two-step dunks just to
show him what he’s capable of
and how strong he can be." ‘

And speaking of what can be,
Shorter has been seriously
attempting to develop a perimeter
shot since last year to compliment
his already outstanding inside
game. The purpose is twofold: if
Shorter is double-teamed inside,
the perimeter shot gives him more
room to work with and also
provides the team with even more
ammunition away from the hoop.

Not only will opponents have
to deal with Shorter’s inside game,
but his offensive prowess gains
yet another dimension with
medium range jumpers.

“lt’s very important for me to

hit that shot this year because if
I can go to the next level, that has
to be part of my game. I’m not
going to be able to post up
against guys who are 6—l0 every
night and day [in the NBA].

“If I can get that shot down,
we’ve got guys who can come in
and play my position and maybe
I can do something else,” Shorter
said.

Shorter has as good a chance
making the NBA as the next
pope being Catholic. He has been
selected to the preseason All-Big
East first team by the league’s
coaches, The Sporting News, The
Big East Yearbook and Dick
Vz‘tale’s Pro/College Basketball
Annual. He currently ranks fifth
all-time in the Big East in career
scoring average.

Last year, he was one of three
Pitt players to reach the 1,000
point plateau as he led the
Panthers in scoring with a 20.6
ppg average and rebounding (9.4
rpg). These statistics carry more
weight when considering Pitt’s
12-17 record and little (no) depth
at power forward.

What is Shorter looking forward
to doing most this season? 
Sitting on the bench. Pitt will run
the full court press, the fast break,
and simply run in general as they
did a year ago. The one big
difference this season is the new
found depth in the recruiting
class which has waited to emerge.

‘No longer will there be only
seven men who play.

Brian Shorter’s game has been slowed by a virual infection since

practice started on October 15.

“We’ve got nine or ten kids
who will be playing and we go at
least that deep as of now,” Evans
said.

“I’m going to appreciate the
breathers the other guys are going
to be able to give me this year.
Playing 38 minutes a game can
really wear on you, ” Shorter said.

So, Shorter is going to get

some well-deserved rest this year,
most likely will have one of his
finest seasons en route to’ the
NBA on a team which is picked to
take it all in the Conference.
What more could this man want?

Vﬁth all the talk of Pitt’s
basketball team having its deepest
bench in years, there still remains
the problem of getting playing
time for the 17 Panther players
this year.

Three players who stand to
lose the most by Pitt's newfound
depth are sophomores Brian
Brush, Travis Ziegler and Brock
Generalovich.

Brush, a-6-foot—5 forward from
Sharpsville, Pa., made the team
as a walk-on last year and played
in 11 games. His best game of the
season was when he played 20

minutes and scored ﬁve points in
a victory over Seton Hall. Brush
was honorable mention All-State
and Mercer County Athlete of the
Year his senior year at Sharpsville
High School.

Ziegler is also a 6-5 forward
and a native of Louisville, Ky. He
is at Pitt on a basketball
scholarship and played in three
games last season. He got
honorable mention as an All-
American by Street and Smiths
after his sophomore year at
Jefferson High School but had his
junior season ruined by two
broken bones in one of his arms.
He made A11—State and Academic
All—Star as a senior.

Generalovich is a 6-1 guard
from Hermitage, Pa., who has an
academic scholarship at Pitt. He
was injured in Pitt's game against
Georgia Tech Dec. 29 and did
not return to action last season.
He captained the football and
basketball teams his senior year
at Hickory High School and was
being class president as well. He
was more highly regarded as a
football player. -

“I had more offers to play
football in college, but you have
to look at what is best for your
future,” said Generalovich. “My
future probably isn’t in pro SpOI’(S.
Iwant to go to med school here.”

Generalovich was what he

called a utility player, playing
quarterback, tight end, linebacker,
punter and place-kicker in high
school. “I played wherever the
team needed me,” he said.

The players all bring different
things to the team. Ziegler cited
his outside shooting, especially
three-pointers, as his strength.

“I think it is that I work hard,”
Brush said. “On the court I work
as hard as anybody.”

“It’s definitely not jumping
ability,” Generalovich said. “I
guess ball handling [is my
strength]. I shoot pretty well.”

Generalovich and Ziegler both
showed some frustration about
last season. “I think when the

team was down 20 in a game or
something, I should have gotten
a chance to play,” Ziegler said. “I
think I deserve a chance. All I
need is a chance to show what I
can do for the team."
Generalovich’s frustration

stemmed more from his injury 

than anything else. “It was
frustrating being hurt,” he said.
“Not being able to play, or even
practice [was tough], especially
when the team was losing.”

As for playing time,
Generalovich said, “I think my
job is to come off the bench if one

of the starters needs a blow. If ,,

Experienced Veterans hope to regain ’87—’88 success

By Linda Holley
sum Writer

Three years ago Pia produced
its first outright Big East men’s
basketball championship, going
124 under second—year coach
Paul Evans. Center Charles Smith

- was named conference Player of

the Year, and guard Sean Miller
earned Freshman of the Year.

Like that 1987-88 team, this
year’s squad is led by an
experienced group of veterans.
So if history repeats itself, 1990
will again be the Year of the
Panther. Jerome Lane, Demetreus
Gore and Smith are gone, but
Bobby Martin, Darelle Porter,
Jason Matthews and Miller have
remained from that explosive
team and are ready to challenge
opponents for another Big East
title.

“We’re going to be a team on a
mission,” said Porter, captain of
this year’s team.

Martin described this year’s
team as having a “killer attitude.”

He mentioned last year’s
disappointing season (12-17, S-
11 in the Big East) saying, “There's
a lot of paybacks to be handed
out.”

What makes this year’s team so
special?

“Experience,” said Porter,
adding that if the present team
played the team from 1987, the
“oldies” would fall. “We have a
lot of returning players, good
depth and more people we can
use coming off the bench. We
can wear a team down.”

In 1987 Pitt lacked a supportive
bench. It had Smith as a dominant
rebounder and scorer, but the
team was exhausted by the end
of the game. Few substitutes
could handle the court like the
starting ﬁve. Martin was the
leading scorer off the bench,
averaging 6.7 points.

“This year everyone is playing,”

explained Porter. “Practice is
better; there's more competition.
In 1987 we practiced with people
who didn’t play, and there was
no challenge.”

Evans said he can expect to call
on nine or 10 players to carry the
team this year.

Martin sees the team’s unity as
an added advantage this year. “In
1987 Charles and Jerome were
our friends, but I don’t think we
had that cohesive bond that
everybody has now.”

This bond could be a result of
this year’s team being the first to
include only Evans’ recruits.

His coaching style has not
changed though, said Martin and
Porter. “You do what he says or
get out. Play within the system.
That’s it.”

Preseason polls have Pitt ranked
in the top 15. In 1987 Pitt was
ranked 12th overall in preseason

polls. “I hope they’re right,” said
Evans.

“I thinkwe’re going to go further
than we did my freshman year,”
said Martin. "That was a team
with all seniors as leaders. This
year we have strong seniors and
juniors as leaders. We have a
great nucleus for a team. We just
have to stay injury free.”

Evans said injuries have been
tough on the team thus far. Brian
Shorter was out for nearly a

month, and Miller missed all of
last year.

Despite last year’s
disappointing record, Porter
doesn’t feel there is any added
pressure on the team. “It helped
us,” he said. “Now we have [our]
endurance built up.”

Evans is hoping this team can
endure. “The chemistry is good
this year. Let’s hope the rankings
are right."

McNeal anxious to play again

By Derek Willis
Sta_ﬁ" Writer

Last year, all Chris McNeal could
do for the Pitt basketball team
was sit, watch and wait. But now

~ he is ready to contribute to this

team after missing last year under
Proposition 48 ‘ guidelines

“Not playing and not practicing
was tough, definitely,” said
McNeal. The 6—foot-8, 235-pound
sophomore hopes to emulate a
teammate who also had to sit out
a year under Prop. 48, namely
Brian Shorter.

Although both play power
forward and hail from the same
school, their roles will be different,
said McNeal. “They don’t need
me to score. We’ve already got
Jason Matthews and Brian Shorter
to do that. I’m just going to
rebound and play defense off the
bench.”

McNeal beneﬁted from the
experience of Shorter, who

SQUIRREL HILL
5 min. from campus

showed no signs of rust after his
season of inactivity. “I just told
him some of the things that would
make him feel better because
sitting out is kind of depressing,”
Shorter said, “and I told him to
think of it in a positive way, to
take advantage of the weightlifting
and do the little things that will
help him in the long run.”

Comparisons between the two
players have come, and some
hold true, said Shorter. “I can see
the physical part in him because
he can go in there and sacriﬁce
his body, so I can see that much
in him about me.”

McNeal agreed but admitted
he has a long way to go to
duplicate the performance of his
teammate. “He’s so patient in the
post and can get his shot off.
Plus, he’s a lot stronger. But he’s
a senior, and when I’m a senior,
l’ll probably be like him.”'

McNeal is another player from
Oak Hill, Va., where he and

Panther freshman Gandhijordan
were teammates on a 22-2 team,
which finished 1 1th in the nation.
As a senior, McNeal averaged 15

points and eight rebounds a game

as a power player — a role he is
expected to continue here at Pitt.

“We feel that he can come in
and play the [power forward]
spot or the [center] spot. I’d put
him right there among the top six
or seven players,” Evans said.

The coaching staff is looking
for McNeal to provide quality
time as a backup to both Bobby
Martin and Shorter, something
Pitt hasn't had in recent years. “In
the past, [Martin and Shorter]
have been playing 35 to 58
minutes a game, and I think
Chris can come in for a good~15
to 20 minutes and play if we
need him to,” said assistant coach
Mark Coleman.

Hill players on the Pitt team,

jones’ versatility gives
Pitt an added feature

By Derek Willis
Staff writer

When Paul Evans went in search of new faces for the 1990-
91 season, he probably had in mind players who could add a
lot to his team by doing the complementary things alongside
the veterans on the squad. Evans might have found his man in
junior-college transfer Antoine Jones.

Jones averaged in double figures in both scoring and
rebounding last year at Allegany Community College in Maryland,
but at 6-foot-7, he can do more than just play inside.

Not a flashy player, Jones hopes to provide depth and
defense for the Panthers this year, two things which usually
translate into playing time in Evans’ book. “He’s a good
defensive player and a good offensive rebounder, so I see him
getting quite a bit of time,” said Evans.

In the Panthers’ first exhibition Jones started in place of
injured Brian Shorter and led the team in rebounds with 10 (six
on the offensive glass) while playing 21 minutes, the most of
any new player. “It was a big confidence builder,” Jones said.

With the eventual return of Shorter to the lineup, Jones’ time
at power forward will likely decrease, but he will be expected
to contribute in other ways. “I think Antoine is key,” Evans said.
“He can rebound, pass and play pretty good defense. We don’t
need five scorers out there.”

With eight new players in
uniform this year for Coach Paul
Evans, the Pitt basketball team
will present some new looks and

_ playing styles in the upcoming

season. All of this activity is due
to the presence of the five
freshmen, one junior-college
transfer and two Proposition 48
sophomores who give Evans

‘depth he has never enjoyed here

at Pitt.

The situation is clearly a stark
contrast to last year, when walk-

four starters averaged over 30

lot different and more enjoyable
for Evans this year. “It’s great I
don’t even have to yell at anybody.
I just say, ‘You go in for hirn,’” he
said.

The newfound depth should
also free up the starters to play
more aggressively and not worry
about having to stay in the entire
game. “I think Brian [Shorter] can
now play more aggressively on
the offensive and defensive
boards,” Evanssaid. “In the past
I think he’s held back a little
because he knew we needed him
out there all the time. ” The diverse
collection of talent these eight
players bring should fit in nicely,

as is evidenced by the preseason.

With four senior starters Evans
needed to bring in eventual
successors for at least three
positions: power forward,
shooting guard and small forward.
Proposition 48 sophomore Chris
McNeal, at 6-foot-8 and 235
pounds, is the heir apparent to
Shorter’s frontcourt spot.

At 6-7, junior-college transfer
Antoine Jones can play both
forward spots, and freshman
Gandhi Jordan is able to swing
between the backcourt and
frontcourt.

At shooting guard, rookie
Ahmad Shareef is a smooth player
a la Jason Matthews, while
another freshman, Tim Glover,
provides three—point range and
hustle.

Also ﬁguring in the rotation are
freshman Omo Moses, a

penetrating point guard who will
play behind Sean Miller and 6-6
local product Jermaine Morgan,
who runs well and could see
duty on the press. All of these
players saw action during the
exhibition season.

One newcomer who must wait
until the end of the first semester
is 6-10 Dominic Dumancic, a
Yugoslavian native who sat last
year under Proposition 48.
Dumancic is a European-style big
man with threeepoint range.

With this class, Evans has filled
many needs simply because there
were so many needs — a bench,
frontcourt depth, a backup point
guard and eventual successors
for the seniors. Evans recognizes
his ample depth but emphasized
the importance of playing it.
“We’ve got to get them good
minutes,” Evans said, “because

A true center would have been
helpful, but Evans is counting on
improvement from Darren
Morningstar. There is a true center
on campus, but 6-11 Eric Mobley
is sitting out this year after
transferring from junior college.

None of these players were
Top 50 recruits coming out of

Moses averaged 15 points and
nine assists his senior year at

Patrick Ewing. McNeal andjordan
were teammates at perennial
national power Oak Hill

team in the country last year, and
Jones’ team at Allegany ﬁnished
13th nationally in the junior-
college standings.

This class, obviously the best

seniors, is full of players with all-
around skills. This enables Evans
to use different combinations to
complement the obvious position
players on the team: Shorter,
Miller and Morningstar. V

While some of the new players
won’t have obvious position roles,
they will contribute through

put it, “Like Coach Evans said, we
have to play defense to get in and

Morningstar gives Pitt inside punch

By Rob Mazur

‘ Staﬁ’ Writer

Lastseason DarrenMorningstar
was used primarily as a sixth
man. He proved ineffective and
slow, often suffering humiliation
at the hands of such strong inside
powers as Syracuse's Derrick
Coleman and Georgetown’s twin
towers of Alonzo Mourning and
Dikembe Mutombo. In the two
exhibition games the Panthers
have played this year, however,
Darren Morningstar has emerged
as a force to be reckoned with,
providing the Panthers with some
new inside punch.

This miraculous transformation
did not occur without some hard
work and sacriﬁce. Morningstar,
who was criticized last year for
being too slow and overweight,
worked in the off—season to
improve his game. “I tried to
work on my game and my weight
over the summer,” said
Morningstar. “I wanted to lose
weight so that I could run the
floor better. I lost about 15 to 20
pounds. My ideal playing weight

is around 238. I'm at 245 right
now. I really just need to monitor
it and keep it under control.”
While he may have been
slowed last year because of his
weight, having to sit out a year
because of a transfer and not
having any bench to speak of did
not help the situation. “I can’t say
how much last year helped.
[Sitting] out a year and a half
because I transferred caused my
game to get rusty. Last year helped

Arne get back into playing‘ and

being able to get back into the
feel of things.”

The Panthers have added a
stellar recruiting class to this year’s
bench. With these new players
added, Morningstar’s role on the
team can change. “Everyone has
helped me raise my game. Darelle
has always gotten the ball to me.
Now the others are looking for
me. I feel that I can give us a body
inside that can play down in the
low blocks,” said Morningstar.

Coach Paul Evans also hopes
that Morningstar can become the
player that he was billed as when
he transferred here from Navy.

“We need Darren so that we can
go against the 7-footers we are
going to face this year. If we are
going to be contenders, we need
to be able to work against the big
men in the low post. Darren lets
us do that,” said Evans.

Morningstar is even getting
international recognition. Lindsay
Gaze, coach of the Melbourne
(Australia) Tigers, said,
“Morningstar is a very good
player. He is efficient, and he
knows what the game is about.”
You may wonder, “Who’s this
guy to analyze American
basketball players?” Gaze coached
the Australian national team in
international competition. He also
is the father of former Seton Hall
player, Andrew Gaze.

The Panthers’ success for the
new season depends on the ability
of Morningstar to maintain the
level of play he has shown thus
far. If he is able to contribute at
his present level, he will provide
Pitt with another inside scoring
threat to complement the existing
front line of Bobby Martin and
Brian Shorter.

Jones

Continued from page 12

Jones can get his points, too. He shot 55 percent from the
floor last year, averaging over 18 points a game, and was named
Most Valuable Player of the MarylandJunior College Tournament.
His team finished 30-6 and was ranked 13th in the nation. He
concedes, however, that the jump from junior college to the Big
East is a big one. “Here, you have seven games in a row that
are tough, where in junior college, you may have three or four
tough games and then one that’s kind of weak,” said Jones.

An honorable mention All-America his senior year at
Southwestern High School in Baltimore, Jones would not have
qualified to be eligible as a freshman under Proposition 48 and
opted for the junior- college route. It was at Allegany that he
made the transition from post—u p player to the versatile forward
he is now.

“I think my all-around skills probably will help me the most,”
Jones said. “I can pass, play defense, score, andl can play inside
or outside, and I think they’ll be a big factor.”

He already seems to have impressed his teammates with his
abilities. “Antoine is [our] Dennis Rodman,” said Bobby Martin.
“He may have a better shooting touch than Rodman, but he
finds the ball; he plays hard defense. I’m enjoying playing with
Antoine.”

On a team with four returning starters, it looks as though
Jones will be battling for minutes in a newly-crowded frontcourt.
The situation at forward doesn’t bother him, though. “I’ll just
keep working hard in practice and let Coach Evans do what he
has to do as a coach,” he said. He already might have a slight
edge, however. After the first exhibition, Evans commented on

Jones’ play, saying, “It seemed that when he was in there we
rebounded a lot better.” Traditionally, rebounding and defense
have been two of Coach Evans’ favorite traits in his players.

Martin hopes new attitude carries over to next level

By Scott Campbell
Asst. Sports Editor

If there’s one word that has
haunted Pitt forward Bobby
Martin throughout his Pitt career,
it is “potential.”

Four years ago as a senior at
Atlantic City (N.J.) High School,
college recruiters used that word
when describing Martin, often
preceding it with laudatory
adjectives like ‘enormous’ and
‘unlimited.’

Martin was a Parade and
McDonald’s All~American
selection as a senior and was
expected to make an immediate
impact on the Pitt team.

For the next three years,
however, his potential remained
just that — potential, unrealized
and untapped. The knock against
Martin was that he often
disappeared from games and let
people with less talent outplay
him.

“Bobby has the talent. He's got
all the tools; he just hasn’t put it
all together in the past,” said Pitt
Coach Paul Evans. “He hasn’t
given 100 percent all the time.”

Not that Martin hasn’t had a
successful career at Pitt. He scored
14 points against NW Missouri St.
last Friday to reach the 1,000-
point plateau and will likely finish
in the top 10 of several categories
for the Panthers by the end of the
season.

But there was always that “F”
word lurking in the rafters of
Fitzgerald Field House.

HALF FOOT

They’re using it again this year
about Martin, now a senior for
the Panthers, but for a different
reason. This time it’s coming from
coaches and scouts on the
professional level.

Although he isn’t getting any
more than honorable mention on
the zillion All-America teams
already out, Martin is drawing the
attention of NBA scouts with his
size and quickness.

Basketball Weekly has tabbed
Martin as one of the top 21 seniors
in the country who will be taken
high in the next NBA draft.

Scouts know Martin can score
and rebound, but they’re also
looking for something that doesn't
show up on any stat sheet —
intensity.

Martin admits now that he didn’t
always concentrate during his
first three years as a Panther. This
year, however, he’s on a mission
to prove the critics wrong — and
Panther fans can thank the Boston
Celtics’ Kevin McHale for it.

Martin attended a Celtics’ camp
over the summer with several
other college players. There he
often found himself assigned to
guard the 6—foot-11 McHale,
something even pro hoopsters
don’t look forward to doing.

And Martin had about as much
luck as other NBA players also
against the Celtics’ All—Star
forward. “He did everything. He
just used me,” said Martin of
McHale. “But he showed me what
it takes to get to the next level. He
showed me a lot of post moves

and gave me a mini—clinic.”

But Martin saw where he stood
in comparison to players on the
next level, and now he feels he
knows what he has to do to get
there.

“I have to improve my
consistency," said Martin. “One
night I’ll have 20 points and 10
boards, but the next night I’ll
have six points. It’s all
concentration.”

Case in point: Last year Martin
had 27 points and 20 rebounds
against Georgetown’s Twin
Towers, Alonzo Mourning and
Dikembe Mutombo, but had only
nine points and sixboards against
Providence’s Marty Conlon in the
next game.

Martin’s scoring, rebounding,
assists and blocked shots have all
increased in each of the past
three years, last year averaging
14.4 points and 8.4 rebounds per
game for the 12-17 Panthers. This
year he has set specific individual
goals for himself, but won’t say
what they are.

“Bobby now knows what it
takes to play on the next level,”
said point guard Sean Miller. “I
really think he’s ready to have an
NBA-type season. When he first
came here, he didn’t play a lot of
hoops. He didn’t live and die
with basketball, but each year his
concentration has gotten better.”

“A lot of people have told me

_Lamont Morgan is also expected

to play a key role and will possibly

The contributions of the young

3) SYRACUSE (68)

Losing a player like Derrick
Coleman would make a
considerable dent in any team.
Coleman’s strong leadership
helped make the Syracuse
Orangemen the power that they
are today. However, if any team
can make the transition smooth
after losing a player of Coleman’s
caliber, it is Syracuse.

With Billy Owens, a highly
touted prospect who has played

a quiet role thus far, and LeRon
Ellis, a veteran who transferred
from Kentucky after that program
was put on probation, waiting to
emerge as a strong force in the
frontcourt for the Orangemen,
Syracuse can retain the
dominance it has enjoyed in the
past.

Coach Jim Boeheim has
assembled a decent recruiting
class added to Owens and Ellis.

4) CONNECTICUT (46)

A year ago, anyone picking the
Connecticut Huskies to reach the
Final Four would have been
locked away.

The Huskies became the third
surprise Big East team to get that
far in four years, following
Providence in 1987 and Seton
Hall in 1989.

This UConn team is different
from those two, however, in that
the Huskies lost only two players
from last year’s 31-6 squad, while
Providence and Seton Hall lost
most of their top players.

Miller

Tate George (graduation) and

Nadav Henefeld (returned to 

Israel) are gone, but this year’s
UConn squad features four
seniors and five juniors, so clearly
the time is now for the Huskies.

All-American candidate Chris
Smith (17.2 points per game, 132
assists) and Rod Sellers (8.2 points,
5.3 rebounds) should lead the
Huskies to their third consecutive
winning season for the first time
since 1982.

Others who will see
considerable action are guards
John Gwynn (10.6 points) and
Scott Burrell (8.2 points).
Freshman Gilad Katz, a former

teammate of Henefeld’s on the .

Israeli National team, will also
see immediate backcourt duty.
— Scott Campbell

5) ST. JOHN’S (45)

As usual, the hype this year is
over Syracuse, Georgetown and
Pittsburgh, but lost in the shufﬂe

ago along with Martin, Matthews,
Porter and Shorter. As a freshman
he started 27 games and helped
the Panthers win their first outright
Big East Championship,
something they haven’t been able
to repeat thus far.

This year the Big East coaches
have tabbed the Panthers to finish
tied for third in the conference

preseason rankings, while several
magazines have picked the
Panthers to finish first in the Big
East and in the top 10 nationally.
“I’m not going to predict
anything,” said Miller. “That’s not
good for the team. We do have a
lot of talent, experience and
depth, but realistically anything
could happen. I think we have a
good chance to be up there.”

squad, which reached the second
round of the NCAA Tournament.
Those four will be expected to
provide the team with the
experience needed to be a Big
East contender.

Their main concern will be
replacing the loss of Greg “Boo”
Harvey, who won four games
with his buzzer-beating heroics
last year.

St. John’s returns seven
upperclassmen, including Malik
Sealy, Billy Singleton, Jason
Buchanan and Robert Werdann,
who should prove to be an
effective combination on the court

Sealy is expected to lead the
team in scoring, while Werdann
solidiﬁes the defense.

Lou Carnesecca, in his 23 years
as head coach for the Redmen,
has two promising recruits to
provide some depth on the bench.
Shawnelle Scott could contribute
immediately at center, and Sergio

6)VILLANOVA(41)

This year’s Villanova Wildcat
squad is moving in a new
direction. For as long as anyone
can remember, the Wildcats have
lived and died on the multiple-
defense system, but this year
Coach Rollie Massirnino is a
changed man.

“Full-court pressure system is
the way I see the game has to be
played now,” said Massimino.
And that’s just what Villanova
will do this year.

But using the press will not be
the only change for this year’s
team. Gone from last year’s 18-15
team are T om Greis and Rodney
Taylor. Despite the fact that Greis,
at 7—foot-3, was a valuable man in
the middle and Taylor, who
started 89 games in his Villanova
career, was valuable in both skill
and experience, the team will
benefit from their absence
because it will be able to run
more.

Perhaps Villanova’s strongest
point this year will be its
backcourt. Junior point guard
Chris Walker returns to control

the Wildcat attack, while junior
Greg Woodard ‘s consistent jump
shot will provide strength and
experience. Add in highly touted
redshirt freshman Lloyd Mumford
and senior Tim Muller to round
out the backcourt.

At forward, Villanova will be
paced by sophomore Big East
All-Rookie Lance Miller and junior
Marc Dowdell. Miller, who last
year averaged 8.4 points per
game, will be looked at to provide
leadership and consistency.

The center position remains
basically up for grabs and should
go to a freshman. Both Anthony
Pelle and Ron Wilson should take
the position and provide strong
play.

7) SETON HALL (30)

There’s a night-and—day
difference, says Coach PJ.
Carlesimo, between this year’s
edition of the Pirates and last
year’s, which went 12-16 (5-11 in
the Big East). Although the team
is dominated by freshmen and
sophomores, they’ve added depth

Captain ‘O’ is tossing

and experience to their squad
and are ready to get back on the
road that led them to the NCAA
Final Four two years ago.

Six-foot-9 Anthony Avent, one
of only two seniors, is expecting
an outstanding season and will
start at center for the Pirates this
year. He averaged 10.5 points
and nine rebounds last year.

The major thrust of the Pirates’
backcourt will come from
returners Terry Dehere, a 1990-
91 Big East All-Rookie selection,
and senior point guard Oliver
Taylor.

Dehere led the team in scoring,
averaging 16 points as a shooting
guard, and is expected to emerge
as one of the league’s premiere
players in that position. Both will
be pushed by freshman Brian
Caver, New Jersey’s top high
school guard last season.

First-year sophomore Jerry
Walker was sidelined all of last
season under Proposition 48 and
is the leading candidate to start at
power forward. 6

him to fit glass high-tops on his Friars’ feet.

It's clear that Providence’s time is in the future.
Eric Murdock (15.4 points per game) and Chris
Watts are the only seniors on this year’s squad.
Junior forward Marques Bragg was the only other
player to average double figures in minutes played
last year.

The success of the Friars depends on how
quickly freshmen Troy Brown, Dickey Simpkins,
Franklin Western and Tom Hall, and junior—college

9) BOSTON COLLEGE (10)
g A new day is rising in Chestnut Hill for Coach Jim
O’Brien. The Eagles’ finest recruiting class ever

combines with several experienced players to
create a young, active team with the ability and
depth to compete in the Big East

Although seniors Doug Able, Bobby Moran and
Corey Beasley are returning, it is the freshmen who
have BC fans excited. Forward Bill Curley is the
best high school player signed by Boston College
—— ever.

For the Eagles to improve, three things must
happen: their shot selection must improve; they
must get to the foul line more, and they must
commit less fouls themselves. BC had 26
disqualifications last year in a league with the six-
foul rule, twice as many as any opponent.

The Eagles are still in the building process, but
the foundation is well in place. Curley and company
will be challenging in a few years.

A major factor that will have an

The players were asked about
their goals for the season. Brush
said that he never sets goals before
the season. Ziegler responded
with a prediction. “We can win it

all,” he said. “If we don’t win the

Big East, something is wrong.”

Generalovich has an added
factor of expectation coming to
Pitt. His father was a star player at
Pitt from 1961 to 1964. "One
thing people ask me a lot is if he
pressured me to play basketball.
He never pressured me to play
basketball or any other sport for
that matter.”

Whenasked to compare himself
to his father, he said, “I never saw
him play. I've been trying to get
a hold of some films of him
playing. I have seen him play
football.

to Pittsburgh would give me the
best chance to start,” remarked
Shareef.

This year, Shareef appears
ready to contribute and stands
ready to be one of the first few
players off the bench. As for his
role on the team, Shareef noted,
‘I hope to come in and contribute
to the team effort, wherever they
need me.”

However, this year may be the
toughest as far as playing time
goes because of the Panthers’

great depth and powerful starting
ﬁve. Besides playing behind star
Jason Matthews, Shareef will most
likely have to share the
supporting role with fellow
freshman Tim Glover and
returning sophomore Brock
Generalovich.

Panther head coach Paul Evans
seems very excited about his
freshman class and its Illinois
import. “He’s athletic, runs very
well, plays pretty good defense
and is a streak shooter,” said
Evans, who added, “[Shareef 1

can get very hot.”

While playing in the Big East
this season will certainly be more
difficult than the Chicago prep-
school league, Shareef is poised
and ready for the upcoming
season.He scored two points in
nine minutes in Pitt's opener
against NW. Missouri St.

“I am really excited to play in
the [Big East] this year. My goal
for the season is to win the Big
East championship. " He feels that
his Panthers teammates are a
much—irnproved squad compared
to last year's 12-17 team.
