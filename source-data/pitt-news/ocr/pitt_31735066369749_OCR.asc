Professor,Wife Unlikely Heroes

By TODD ERKEL

A Pitt professor and his wife left
Pittsburgh two weeks ago with plans
of dropping their daughter off at col-
lege and doing a little birdwatching
afterwards. They had no plans of
returning as the heroes of much of
the nation—-including a Colorado
family who, thanks to the couple's
efforts, has been reunited with its
3-year-old daughter—but they have.

Steven Gaulin, a professor of
anthropology here and his wife Cyn-
thia got their first chance to talk to
the parents of Lori Poland, a little
girl the Gaulins discovered at the
bottom ofa secluded outhouse while
birdwatching in Denver's Stapleton
Park, located about l0 miles outside
the city.

The Gaulins did not realize it at
the time, but their discovery brought
an end to the nation-wide search for
little Lori who was abducted outside
her Sheridan, Colorado, home four
days earlier.

The couple went for help after
they discovered the child and real-
ized they could not get her out ofthe
eight-foot deep well in which she was
emersed.

“I wasn’t sure I could fit through
the hole,” Steven Gaulin said, “but if
I could, it wouldn't have done any
good because it was so deep [that] I
couldn’t have handed her up to my
wife.”

The police who received Gaulin’s
call for help immediately questioned
him as to whether this might be the
missing girl.

“I started describing the child, and
they said, ‘Is it a boy or girl?’and I
said, ‘I can’t tell that,’ " Gaulin
recounted. “[I said] it’s about two-
years or three-years-old with lon-
gish, blonde hair, and they said, ’Is it
a girl?’ and I said, ‘I’m not sure.’
Then I got the idea that they were
looking for somebody [but] even at
that point, I didn't realize it was a
kidnapping. I thought she was lost, I
just didn't know."

Now that the Gaulins have
returned home, they want to know
all they can about the condition of
the girl they discovered, and they
were anxiously awaiting their ‘meet-
ing’ with Lori‘s parents which took
place last evening via a television
satelite hookup between a local tele-
vision station and one in Denver.

“When something like this
happens, you invariably feel bound
up with the person's life in a certain

way,” Gaulin said. “We heard from
the FBI that she was in fair condi-
tion in the hospital, but then we read
on the way back that she was in
serious condition. We were con-
cerned that her condition was wor-
sening. I hear now that she is better,
but I’d like to talk to her parents
about it.”

Lori's parents are not the only
ones ready to show their graditude
to the Gaulins. The entire Denver
community wants to somehow
reward the Pittsburgh couple for
their efforts.

“Apparently there is a reward-
the FBI agents who talked to us said
that there was——but that is obviously
not why we did it,“ Gaulin said. “It
wasjust dumb luck. People say, ‘Oh,
what a heroic thing’ but there was
nothing even remotely heroic about
it. It was nothing that any normal
human being wouldn’t have done
under the same circumstances.“

The Gaulins had actually gone to
the wrong park in their search for a
Williamson Sapsucker, a bird found
in that part of the country.

“I didn‘t find the bird,” Gaulin
told a reporter at the scene, “but I
found something better. I'll have
another chance at [the bird],“ he
said. “I probably wouldn't have
another chance to save this girl.“

WPGH Edges
Toward FM

By CHRISTINA CLINTON

After nearly six years ofhoping, it
is almost certain that WPGH radio
station will become an FM station
by the Fall of 1984, according to
Larry Lunsford, Pitt‘s media
advmen

As of late Tuesday, a Federal
Communications Commission
(FCC) representative indicated to
Lunsford that FM status would be
granted to the station in the next
four to six weeks.

The same FCC representative
indicated to Lunsford that the sta-
tion‘s application passed its final
stage which was a final engineering
check by FCC engineers. Lunsford
said that because of a backlog of
FCC applications, it would take
four to six weeks before the applica-
tion is granted.

If WPGH’s application is granted,
it will be a dream come true for the
station and for student activities
officials.

The station's quest for FM status
began in the Fall of 1977 when the
station and the Student Government
Board started sending out perusal

letters, thus beginning the FCC
process.

Over the years, Lunsford said, the
station‘s personnel followed up on
its hope to become FM and applied
to the FCC to become a commercial
station on the FM dial.

Conflicts then arose with Carne-
gie Mellon University's WRCT and
Bethany College’s WBVC over
requests for the same air space,
Lunsford said. WPGI-I’s frequency
would have interfered with both of
those stations. Although Bethany is
in Washington, Pa., one of the three

stations would have had to reduce _

wattage because the three were in
conflict.

In addition, the National Associa-
tion of Broadcasters (NAB) success-
fully convinced the FCC to freeze all
of Pitt‘s requests because a television
station in Johnstown wanted tojoin
the Pittsburgh market on a cable
channel. WPGH‘s frequency would
have interfered with that.

WPGH spent nearly two years in
frozen limbo while Lunsford and
other officials at Pitt tried to get the
requests un-frozen. Experts in both

By TODD ERKEL

A campus policeman has been
terminated from the force fol-
lowing a departmental investiga-
tion into a shooting incident
involving the officer which
occurred in June.

Criminal charges against the
campus policeman, John Mar-
quez, 27, of 5535 Hobart St.,
Squirrel Hill, were dropped at a
preliminary hearing on July I5,
but the university‘s internal
investigation proceeded, result-
ing in Marquez's dismissal.

Marquez has the oppurtunity
to appeal the decision to the uni-
versity administration. lfthe uni-
versity upholds the ruling,
Marquez could then have the
matter brought to arbitration, a
move that, according to one pub-
lic safety official, would “drag on
for quite a while."

The absence of criminal
charges had no bearing on the
university‘s investigation, Walter
Waters, assistant director of
Pitt‘s public safety department
said.

Pitt Police
Officer Fired

“He could have actually been
found innocent, but if our inves-
tigation would show otherwise,
disciplinary action would still be
taken," Waters said.

Waters said he was not sur-
prised by the dropping of crimi-
nal charges but denied further
comment. The department’s
investigator assigned to the Mar-
quez case—Fran Walsh——would
not comment on the matter.

Waters did confirm that Mar-
quez's past record, which
included previous disciplinary
suspensions, was considered in
the decision. A shooting incident
involving Marquez in December,
I980, led to his suspension and a
formal protest coordinated by
Pitt’s Black Action Society.

Waters described that incident
as “dated" but said that other
minor incidents involving Mar-
quez weighed in the decision to
terminate him.

Washington and Massachusetts
were consulted to help the station.

“The NAB was too strong and we
weren't going to win,“ Lunsford
said, “so we looked for alternatives.“

The first alternative that was
devised was described by Lunsford
as a “purple cow." It was an idea that
was never done before and probably
wouldn’t be done again. Pitt
requested that WPGH be classified
as an educational station but exist
on the commercial band at 98.5.

“We amended our original appli-
cation to make the move," Lunsford
said. “Our chances were less than 50
percent; it was a precedent-setting
request and could have opened a
floodgate for other requests."

Nevertheless, Lunsford said Pitt
remained optimistic.

To assist the station in its battle,
Pitt retained Ed Perry from Dux-
bury, Mass. to help out. Perry is the
technical adviser for the Education
FM Association and the university
also employed a law firm in
Washington, D.C. .

In July of this year, Perry told
Lunsford that he expected WPGH‘s
application to be granted by the end
of the summer because Bethany and
CMU’s problems were worked out.

Throughout the whole time,
Lunsford said he remained optimis-
tic that FM status would be granted.
When plans for the student union
renovation were being made, the
new radio station was designed spe-

The Pitt News, Wednesday Aujggt 3!, I983

cifically as an FM station, he said.

Lunsford said the station’s facili-
ties have been called “one of the tin-
est FM college stations in the
country“ by people who have
inspected it.

If FM status is granted, Lunsford
said it will be in the form of a con-
struction permit. The FCC allows
stations it grants licenses to one year
to construct studios that meet FM
standards. Since WPGH has most of
the necessary equipment, that part
will be easy.

The station is currently a carrier-
current station, which means it
broadcasts through telephone

broadcast loops to the dorms and '

the student union——the only two pla-
ces WPGI-I can be heard.

If WPGH does become FM by
Fall of I984, Pitt will have to pur-
chase and install an antenna for the
top of the Cathedral of Learning and
a new transmitter. The station will
reach a radius of I5-l8 miles at an
output of 18 watts.

The initial operation costs of the
construction will be covered by
Chancellor Wesley Posvar’s budget
for equipment, Lunsford said, and
the rest will come from allocations
from the Student Publications and
Media Board.

Because the station will be consi-
dered an educational one, Lunsford
said some format change will have to
be made if FM status is granted. The
station, however, is equipped to
handle any such changes. The new

.. WPGH Eyes FM Status

sound-proof rooms will enable the
student staff to conduct live inter-
views, have readings, stage plays and
a host of other types of
programming.

Mike‘ Freshwater, General Man-
ager of WPGH, said he is not sure
how the programming will be
changed because he won't be in
charge in the Fall ofl984, but he did
say changes will be made.

“I would think they would head
towards more Top 40 and album-
oriented rock rather than the new
music we now play,” he said.

Freshwater also said if an FM
license is granted, there will be a
good chance that it would be an
unlimited license, meaning they
could be on the air 24 hours and also
during the summer.

Because of the station’s non-
commercial status, Freshwater said
there will probably be_ more news
and public affairs programming.

The staff of the station would also
increase drastically, he said.

“More people will definitely be
coming up,“ Freshwater said. “We
have better facilities than CMU.
Since we will be an open-air station,
we'll need more people because
we're getting more public attention."

Freshwater, Lunsford and other
student activities officials will just
have to wait until the official word
comes from Washington that their
FM dream is a reality.

Officer
Fired

himselfin to Pittsburgh police on
June 22. A warrant for his arrest
had been issued by city detectives
following complaints by two
South Side men, Thomas De-
Klaven, 21, of l6l9 St. Patrick
St., and Robert Dusch, 20, of 80
S. 26th St., who claimed Mar-
quez had fired a shot into the
trunk of their car following a
near collision with a car driven
by Marquez. '

The original charges of two
counts each of aggravated
assault and recklessly endanger-
ing another person and one
count of violating a city firearms
ordinance were dropped when
the two complainants decided
not to press charges.

The gun allegedly fired by
Marquez was obtained on his
commission as a Pitt policeman.
Carrying such a weapon off-duty
violates departmental policy,
according to Waters. Another
departmental charge filed
against Marquez was conduct
unbecoming an officer, Waters
said.

Marquez would have been an
officer here for five years as of
this September.

Opinion

L

Slapping Our
Hands

Pitt’s Office of Residence Life (OR L) has once again
slapped the hands of dorm students and sent them to
bed without any supper for something they didn’t even
do.

ORL’s new alcohol policy is both unfair to dorm
students over the legal drinking age of 21 and archiac.
While The Pitt News does not and should not condone
drinking by those underage, the new policies will only
prove to do more harm than good.

Students 21 and over who live in the dorms are
going to be monitored by ORL and its henchmen.
They are required to fill out an “Alcoholic Beverage
Registration Form” and are limited to a predeter-
mined amount of alcohol.

ORL also says that beer in kegs, bulk containers,
“pumpers” and in bottles is prohibited. Beer may only
be brought in cans and only 12 cans are allowed by one
person per week. This means no more dorm parties or
informal gathering since alcohol cannot be transmit-
ted from dorm to dorm by residents.

Although the administration has been working on a
new policy since last fall, the real fuss did not emerge
until after the tragic death of Pitt football player Todd
Becker last Decmber. ORL then had a real reason to
crack down on Pitt student’s drinking habits.

But it’s notjust the drinking. ORL seems to want to
change the lifestyles of students 21 and over by telling
them what they can and cannot do in regards to alco-
hol. The State of Pennsylvania trusts them enough to
permit them to drink, why can’t the University of
Pittsburgh?

It’s hard to imagine that the Resident Student Asso-
ciation (RSA) would let ORL get away with this. RSA
is, after all, the voice of dorm students and should be

"standing up for the rights of its constituents. In fact,

every dorm student over the age of 21 should be up in
arms against this policy that unfairly punishes them.

ORL should have taken more time on this issue
because it is a delicate one. They should have held an
open forum or polled students before laying down the
law so harshly.

Once again, Pitt students were given the shaft while
they were home during the summer.

The only good thing to come out of ORL’s new
policy will be Pitt’s image. Citizens of the city will
praise Pitt’s crackdown on student drinkers and say
Pitt did it for the good of all. Perhaps this was the
driving force behind ORL’s decision, but we certainly
hope it wasn't. .

This new policy will be difficult to enforce unless
ORL hires the National Guard to do it. College stu-
dents have been sneaking around with alcohol since
the beginning of time and probably won’t stop because
of one little policy.

College Tuition Hurts Middle Class

Dear Editor:

College tuitions that are so high
that they are restrictive forthe mid-
dle class constitute a comtemptible
form of discrimination based on
class because they deny the majority

of our people access to educational

opportunity and ultimately the pro-
fessions. But it is even more repug-
nant when prohibitively excessive
tuitions "a“t state-supported medical
schools present the taxpayers with
insurmountable financial barriers
that discourage their children from
even submitting applications for
admission.

The prestigious medical schools
scattered all over this great nation
have served, particularly since the
second world war, as symbols of
social mobility. The university
health centers are America's meta-
phorical brass ring. For decades the
brightest and most industrious of
our young people from poor and
middle-income families have
struggled to excel academically,
knowing that once accepted to medi-
cal school they would ﬁnd means to
pay for their education. Cities like
Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago, and
New York are particularly fortunate

in having three or more medical ‘

schools within their city limits.
Unfortunately, Pittsburgh has only
one.

Because Pitt is the only medical
school in western Pennsylvania, the
responsibilities that fall on its
shoulders are great. The administra-
tors of the University of Pittsburgh
School of Medicine, as well as its
faculty and board of trustees, have
failed completely in meeting the
most fundamental of these
responsibilities-that of keeping a
medical school education within
financial reach of all of the citizens
of Pennsylvania whose taxes sustain
the institution. If Pitt were private
like Case Western University or
Johns Hopkins we could write it off
as lying beyond the control of the
taxpayers. But because Pitt is exten-
sively state-related, the taxpayers of
Pennsylvania are in a position to
demand some answers and accoun-
tability from those in a position to
inﬂuence the cost of medical school
tuition at Pitt.

ln recent years, administrators at
Pitt have defended large tuition
increases on the grounds that they
were simply keeping up with the rate
of inﬂation. However, in 1983, with
the national annual inﬂation rate
running at about 4 percent, medical
school tuition for in-state students at
Pitt was increased by $2.000 tojust
under the $12,000 mark‘, an increase
of more than 20 percent, and five
times the rate of inﬂation. ln
announcing the increase, neither the
chancellor nor the dean of the
School of Medicine said anything
about inﬂation rates.

a

At other times, enormous tuition
increases at the medical school have
been defended on the grounds that
the legislators in Harrisburg had not
increased state grants to Pitt. But in
1983, Pitt's School of Medicine
received an increase in capitalization
grants that , amounted to tens of
thousands of dollars. Why then, in
the face of the lowest increase in the
cost of living in nearly a decade and
a windfall from the state, did tuition
jump so much at the School of Med-
icine? The taxpayers of Pennsylva-
nia and the citizens and good people
of Pittsburgh who treasure our great
community deserve some answers.

If questions aren’t raised and
answers and solutions forthcoming,
things could in fact get much worse.
In response to the overabundance of
physicians and the skyrocketing
medical costs, the federal govern-
ment is now loath to provide any
more support for the training of doc-
tors. Resources everywhere are
increasingly constrained. Appreciat-
ing this reality, administrators and
benefactors and governing boards at
most of the nation’s medical schools
are drawing up priority lists and
demanding better bookkeeping.
Men and women at these medical
schools who are sensitive to the
democratic principle of equity of
educational opportunity are actu-
ally encouraging debate about
resource useand the problems of
financing medical education.

Instead of debate and discussion
about how to balance limitless
options and limiting resources so as
to keep the medical school classes
open to more than just rich people,
Pitt’s School of Medicine is in the
midst of a mind-boggling expansion
where the sky seems to be the limit:
liver transplants, test-tube babies, a
six million dollar renovation of the
basic science departments, the pur-
chase of more electron microscopes,
brain transplants, and a multi-
million dollar nuclear magnetic
resonance facility. With all these
exciting programs, is it any wonder
that the medical scientists and doc-
tors on the faculty at Pitt ignore the
plight of students and the issue of
tuition costs? Their blind eye and
deaf car are a major reason why Pitt
is now the most expensive state-
related medical school in the coun-
try by a long shot.

With scholarships and loan sup-
port for medical students decreasing
and with the high interest rates that
prevail, there are few places students
can turn for financial assistance. It is
up to the faculty and administrators
at Pitt to join together to seek solu-
tions to the tuiton problem.

Something can be done. First, we
must demand strict control and cen-
tralization of the medical practice
plans at Pitt that bring in close to
$50 million annually -in revenues

from patient care in the teaching
hospitals of the School of Medicine.
Dr. Jack Cooper, President of the
American Association of Medical
Colleges, stated recently that pay-
ment from medical practice plans by
full-time clinical faculty members is
the most rapidly growing source of
income for medical schools. Right
now there are 16 seperate, autono-
mous and secret practice plans at
Pitt that restrict the ﬂow of profits to
the general operating budget of the
School of Medicine. The practice
plans at most American medical
schools are taxed to the extent that
5-15 percent of their net proﬁts go
directly to the dean's office where
they are applied to minimize tuition
increases.

Six liver transplants in one week is
a truly heart-warming accomplish-
ment and one of which we should all
be proud. And it will be nice to have
a 2 million dollar magnet humming
away in the basement of Presbyter-
ian Hospital, the core teaching hos-
pital of the School of Medicine. But
what impact do these costly pro-
grams have on tuition, and is medi-
cal school tuition uderwriting them?
Medical school tutions will continue
to soar unless the practice plans are

scrutinized and regulated. The prac- ‘

tice plans must contribute a greater
proportion to the operating budget
of the University of Pittsburgh
School of Medicine.

The second way to slow the rate of
increase in tuition at Pitt is to do
what other institutions do, establish
a priority list and acknowledge that
one can't do everything. The cost of
tution must be factored into the
priority list.

If Pitt balks at reforms and per-
sists in ignoring the impact of the
enormous tuition on the aspirations
of middle-class Pennsylvanians for
careers in medicine, then the state
should strike Pitt from the roll of the
taxpayer-supported institutions and
throw all of its ﬁnancial support to
the other state-supported medical
schools, Temple and Penn State,
Hershey. This would accomplish
two worthwhile goals: it would
reduce the number of physicians and
increase the per capita support of
medical students. Pittsburgh is one
of the finest cities in America. We
must see to it that its only medical
school lives up to the high standards
we demand of the city's other public
institutions.

Financial Aid

By DIANE LEFKOWITZ

Tuition is going up but the
amount of financial aid distributed
isn't. The gap between the .cost of
college and what students can actu-
ally afford is not always filled.

The Financial Aid office at Pitt,
however, is “trying to maximize the
number of sources that a kid applies
to,” said Dan May, director of the
office, “or to make available the
greatest amount of money he or she
is going to receive.”

Communicating to students
about all the aid available is confus-
ing, May said; but roughly 75 per-
cent of the Pitt students receive
some type of financial aid.

Aid is distributed through the uni-
versity and the state and federal
government in the form of various
loans, grants and scholarships. Stu-

dents can receive aid from more -

than one source, depending on the
circumstances.

Most of the student aid programs
fall under the federally-sponsored
Title IV program. In the past ten
years, over $309 million in Title IV
funding has been distributed to Pitt
through programs such as:

Pell Grant-formerly known as
the Basic Educational Opportunity
Grant, this is the only type of finan-
cial aid administered directly by the
federal government. This is consid-
ered “entitlement” for students,
assuring them of federal aid.

National Direct Student
Loan(NDSL)-based on financial
need, the five percent interest rate is
appealing to many students. Under-
graduates are eligible to borrow up
to $6,000 over a four-year period.
Graduate and professional students
may borrow up to $12,000 including
undergraduate loans.

Supplemental Educational
Opportunity Grants_ (SEOG)-
this grant was designed to help fill
the gap between family contribu-
tions and the amount of aid the stu-
dent is receiving from other
sources, and the actual college
costs. Grants range from $200 to
$1500 but may not exceed $4,000 for
four years.

Work/Study-the university

    

government to award a student the
amount of money he can earn at a
job. Pitt determines the students’
needs and sets them up in a regular
on-campus job.

Guaranty Student Loan
(GSL)-this income-based loan is the
largest student aid program in terms
of dollars and student participation.
It is also the most expensive in terms
of fiscal committment by the
government. The loan itself is
funded by private lending institu-
tions and the federal government
subsidizes the 9 percent interest.

One recent stipulation attached
to federal aid is the Solomon
Amendment, which requires stu-
dents to sign up for the Selective
Service before receiving govern-
ment aid. .

This summer, Congress said the
requirement is unconstitutional, but
the Supreme Court overrode that
decision and the law will be imple-
mented in October. As of October,
receivers of federal financial aid
have to provide a document proving
they signed up before Title IV
money is distributed.

Students who already received
disbursements of aid are required to
send a form to Pitt saying they
signed up.

The financial aid programs were
flourishing a few years ago. Money
distributed through the Pell Grant
ram went from 3.5 ' '

$7 million from 1979-81. During that
same period, the GSL program
jumped from $12 million to $25
million.

The Reagan Administration then
came into power and put income
caps on the GSLS, once distributed
unconditionally, and reduced the
effectiveness of the Pell Grant pro-
gram, according to May. Congress
has since reinstated some of the
money taken away.

“He (Reagan) cut the money out
and Congress put it back in the
budget,” May said. “What has hap-
pened in the past three years is pro-
grams have been severely capped
and gradually monies have been
restored.

Not all of that money has been
restored, as many Title IV programs
are still suffering and funds for some
are decreasing so drastically it may
result in some programs’ demise.

One such program is the NDSL,
for which federal money was
reduced by $250,000 in Fiscal Year
1983—a 20 percent decrease from
the year before. The fiscal year 1984
(FY 84) budget eliminates all federal
funding for the program.

Lending institutions will therefore
rescind money collected from loan
repayments on a “revolving loan”
basis.

The SEOG program also does
not seem to have a very bright
future. After a 22 rcent reduction

Long Looks at Short Skirts

By WES COTTER

The best part of the Valleygirl
craze for most men wasn't hearing
“fur shur” or the other spacey jar-
gon that was created; it was the
rediscovery of the female legs that
the miniskirt brought about.

The miniskirt that was a product
of the Valleygirl bit has become
fashion trend that swept the coun-
try, exposing legs everywhere it has
gone.

“Sure they wear them to catch
eyes,” said Theresa Riga, a Kauf-
mann’s salesperson and a senior at
Pitt. “They’re definitely more
exposed.”

‘‘I guess it's something different
and it helps them (those who wear
miniskirts) stand out,” said Sandy
Thompson, also a Kaufmann’s
representative. “Mostly the younger
kids wear them.”

Clementine Bulava, a salesperson
for Home’s, narrowed the buying
group further.

“Mostly the teenagers, fourteen
to eighteen, are really interested in

them,” she said. Girls wear them, 5

she said, because “they show off
their nice legs. If I were young and
had pretty legs, I'd wear them.”
Riga said the sales of miniskirts
have been going down, and the stvle

is changing a little bit. She said they
are now selling miniskirts in denim
and corduroy and coordinating
them with the Flashdance look.

Bulava also said changes are com-
ing about in the miniskirt.

“They’re not selling very well,”
she said. “They were at first, but
now they don't like printed ones and
go mostly for the solid colored
ones."

The miniskirt is a recurring
fashion that seemed to start in the
60’s and has again become popular
in the 80’s.

“I think they’ve evolved from the
60’s,” said Deborah Palomed, a
Kaufmann’s salespersn. “The ones
in the old movies look like the ones
from today, only a little different.”

She also said that girls like minis-
kirts because they’re different, com-
fortable and to wear one is to be
“with it.”

A problem with being “with it” is
that fashions change, and it looks
like a slump in sales is proving that
the miniskirt fad is fading.

“I don't think it will last long,” Riga
said.

“Yes, I think it's a fad,” Palomed
said. “I think it's dying out and I
don't think it will last more than a
few months. They won't be big in the
winter.

Thompson added that the spe-
cialty shops that sell a lot of mini’s
will change when the trend dies. But
there are some who disagree.

“They’re trendy and they’ll stick
around,” said Robin Murray, a stu-
dent at Michigan State. “They’re
dressier than jeans and I think
they’re great. I feel dressier.”

Bob Duffy, an x-ray specialist,
said, “I hope it stays. It’s the best
part of the summer. In the winter
they’re all covered up.”

Rich Frencho, a shoe salesman,
said girls wear miniskirts just to be in
fashion, and fashions do change.

“They'll stay around for a summer
or two and then we can go back to
halters and shorts,” said student
Ken Kruzka. “Fashions and fads
repeat themselves.”

The miniskirt has become quite
popular and can be seen almost any-
where and on many different builds.
Some girls are self-conscious about
their legs and others like to show
them off, but it seems that everyone
has a different way of looking at girls
who wear mini’s.

“A lot of heavy girls look terrible
Ifl them,” Thompson said. “I think if
you have the body for it, wear it.”

“If the legs are nice, so is every-
thing else, right?” Duffy agreed.

in funding, the program is in danger
of being totally eliminated in next
year’s budget.

The loss of this program would
not only be a direct loss of money to
students, but it would eliminate a
program directed toward the needs
of middle-income students.

The federal government has
enacted a number of provisions to
reduce the GSL, including doubling
the origination fee from 5 percent to
10 percent and instituting a Needs
Test for families with income over
$30,000.

The amount of the loan has been
limited to ﬁnancial need, and the
grace period for repayment of the
loan has been reduced from nine to
six months. Those provisions have
cut 30 percent from the GSL pro-
gram from FY 82 to FY 83. which
amounts to $10 million. Another $6
million cut is projected for I-Y 84.

Another program that may be in
jeopardy is the Pell Grant, which in
FY 83 awarded approximately $1.5
million less than in the previous
year—31 percent less than two
years before. Proposed program
reductions for FY 84 would result in
an additional loss of $2.6 million at
Pitt.

Current regulations for a Pen-
nsylvania Higher Education
Assistance Agency (PHEAA)
grant require all students to apply
for Pell grants. If the projected Pell
reductions come through, PHEAA
will have to alter its awarding for-
mula drastically because of a pro-
posed 8 percent reduction in
PHEAA funds.

PHEAA would be forced to shift
its awarding plan to replace Pell
money to lower income groups or
they will be forced to deny these
groups aid for essential college
costs.

In addition, the federal govern-
ment has been reducing its support
for the Work/Study program over
the past couple years. The Univer-
sity is trying to combat this by
increasing their support from 20¢. to
40¢ on the dollar.

It is projected that in FY 84, the
Work/Study program will receive
even less federalsupport than in
previous years.

j

Does this sound like a hopeless
situation to you, where only the
neediest will obtain the necessary
aid to attend college? May specu-
lates that a recovery may be on the
way.

“Reagan has this new attitude
toward education now,” he said.
“He’s concerned about education
on the grade school and high school
level, but it may pour over to the
university level. Hopefully, we’ll
maintain what we have and possibly
gain.”

To help the upperclassmen deal

with college costs, a deferred pay- .

ment plan for tuition can be made in
which the student pays a down pay-
ment of one-third and makes two
more equal installments. Call the
office of Student Loans and Special
Accounts at 624-6422 for more
information on this plan.

If you're lucky_enough that your
parents will take out a loan for your
education (and repay it!), there are
Parent Loan Plans available through
some institutions, like Pittsburgh
National Bank and Equibank.

The Pitt Financial Aid office helps
about 12,000 students receive aid
(not including the GSL) per year. It
also distributes a Financial Aid
Update sheet to 45,000 students
each year.

Counselors are on hand at the
office everyday to speak with stu-
dents, and the office handles the
actual applying each year after the
student initially applies for aid. May
encourages students to make xerox
copies of all forms, letters, etc.

In addition to the widely known
sources of aid, many organizations
and corporations award various
grants and scholarships. Informa-
tion about such aid can be found on
the ground ﬂoor of Hillrnan Library,
behind the card catalogue. Addi-
tional publications can be located in
the reference section.

With the aid available and the help
of the Financial Aid office—plus
some budgetary planning on your
part—there is a way of making ends
meet so you can afford your
education.

“Blondes with a 36-24-36 inch fig-
ure should wear them and they
should be well-toned, without ﬂab,”
Frencho said. “They know what’s
showing when they look sexy and
feel sexy.”

Murray described the kind of mini
she doesn't like.

“Mine are cute,” she said.
“They’re not leather with zippers or
studs.”

Even an attractive woman like
Murray can be selfconscious about
her legs. Before she dons her mini,
she says, ‘‘I think about it and build
up my courage.”

Another aspect of feeling self-
conscious in a mini is the amount _of
femininity the dress conveys.
Thompson said the new denim ones

aren't very feminine and described
the ones she like as “short and

)9

SCXV.

“The more you see, the better,”
Duffy said.

“Guys can see more of your legs,”
Murray said, “unlike jeans. They like
them because they’re feminine.”

Whatever kind of miniskirt people
prefer to look at and wear, it seems
that mini’s are stirring up attention
and giving the guys something to

- look at. Whether or not mini’s will

fade away like they did in the 60’s
has yet to be seen. But one thing is
certain—the Valleygirl mini has
come a long way and has become
appealing to a great number of
people-

By PEGGY FERRI

Pitt is busy exploring and dis-
cussing ways to celebrate its
bicentennial and welcome
incoming freshmen who will
graduate as Pitt’s bicentennial
class.

Plans are not ‘definite, but an
ad hoc bicentennial committee
formed by Chancellor Wesley
Posvar has been at work for the
last year researching previous
observances at Pitt and other
universities. Because not many
other institutions have cele-
brated bicentennials, there is not
much precedent to follow.

John Quatroche, secretary to
the Board of Trustees, stressed
that expense is a factor in Pitt’s
celebration plans.

“We want to minimize the use
of university hard money,” Qua-
troche said. Private donations,
therefore, and other ways of
making the celebration as cost-
free as possible are preferable, he
explained.

The bicentennial celebration
will be a year—long observance at
the university.

“Everything that happens nor-
mally at Pitt—symposiums,
Homecoming, Honors Convoca-
tion——will have a bicentennial
thrust,” Quatroche said.

Signs of Pitt’s bicentennial in
1987 have already begun spring-
ing up in Oakland.

Banners on Fifth Avenue draw
attention to the bicentennial and
welcome incoming freshmen.
The official bicentennial logo has
also been approved by the com-
mittee. The logo, however, which
uses the design of the University
Medal, will not be used officially
until the bicentennial.

In addition to these and other
observances of the bicentennial,
author Robert Alberts will write
the definitive history of the
university.

Alberts has written many arti-
cles for American Heritage mag-
azine and‘ biographies that
include that of HJ. Heinz. His
latest book, “Shaping of the

Point,” covers the history of
Point Park in downtown Pitts-

burgh. He is himselfa I930 grad-.

uate of Pitt.

The present ad hoc committee
includes: Dr. Albert Van Dusen,
vice-chancellor emeritus; Dr.
Anne Pascasio, School of Health
Related Professions; Dr. Paul
Masoner, director of the Office
of Special Programs; Dr. Ber-
nard Koperek, director of

tion Science; Lucille Crozier,

Quatroche said he expects the
actual bicentennial committee to
be selected soon. Students, he
added, will be represented in the
actual committee although the
problem of student turnover in
the Student Government Board
will have to be considered.

By CHARLIE O’HARA

The emotion has been overflow-
ing since Pitt junior star hurdler
Roger Kingdom returned from his
triumphant quest to Caracas, Vene-
zuela, where he captured the gold
medal in the prestigious IX Pan
American Games.

Kingdom singed the ll0-meter
strip of hurdles in a personal best
time of 13.44, while defeating several
of the world’s top-ranked
performers.

Among the defeated were Alejan-
dro Casanas of Cuba who was the
former arch rival of" Renaldo Nehe-
miah as wellas being ranked No. 2 in
the world in 1982. Tony Campbell of

the United States, who in 1982 was _

ranked No. 8 in the world, also fell
victim to the superior efforts of his
countryman and teammate.

For Kingdom, the victory stands
for many things.

-  “I was very excited, obviously,”



Kingdom said. “More than any-
thing, I discovered that I can run
with and beat the best in the world.
The reception that I have received
since getting in last night has been
very special. The football practice
that I attended was also quite emo-
tional. It gave me quite abit of pride
standing up in front of the team that
I was a part ofjust one year ago.”
V For Foge Fazio and the rest ofthe
Panthers, the appearance was also

quite moving.

“We’re so proud of Roger,” Fazio
said. “He has proven to our team
how it is possible to go into a hostile
arena and come out a champion.”

The hostile crowd was only one of

the obstacles which he had to over- .

Even before the first of the weekly
media get-together luncheons began
yesterday, Tennessee football coach
Johnny Majors was corralled for a
phone hook-up from Knoxville.

Christening the conversation was
‘a question detailing the mood on the
southern campus as the Volunteers
prepare to host Pitt Saturday night
at 7:30 p.m. _

“It’s been extremely, hot for the
first two weeks of practice” Majors
said.“The heat’s slowed the tempo
and practicing."

That heat will not likely abate
when the Panthers take the ﬁeld at
Neyland Stadium, before a fully-
packed house of 91,000. They are still

selling 5,000 more in standing-room. A

It seems to be as unlikely a place

as any for Pitt head coach Foge‘

Fazio to begin his second campaign,
coming on the heels of a season
when followers anticipated nothing
less than a perfect showing.

- With the season opener at Tennes-
see, though, Fazio and his generally
new staff of assistants (five in their
first year) have something to prove.
In different respects than last year.

Though not obviously porous all
around, this is a team that reveals
inexperience in more than several
glaring areas. ,

Doubts rest heavily on junior
John Cummings’ shoulders, the

1 ones that have been selected to carry

on now that Dan Marino and his .

8657 passing yards are yesteryear’s
memories. I

Cummings easily beat out sopho-
more Chris Jelic at training camp as
he completed 12 of 14 passes in the
final two scrimmages and threw
nary an interception. Of course, he
was aided along the waywhen Jelic
suffered a sprained thumb in his
throwing hand earlier on."

1

That now fully healed, question

‘still remains as to what would spur

Faziogto pull Cummings in favor of
Jelic. If at all. . ‘ .

“We haven’t played a game yet,”
Fazio said yesterday,“and right now
John is our No. 1 quarterback; we
plan on going with him. We,just
don’t know what’s going to happen
after that.” I

‘Homecoming '52 Youth Days

In that same backfield, the run-
ning game sits more solidified, but it
is far from securely established.

Senior Joe McCall, 6-1, 190 lb. All-
East candidate, played the role of

Bryan Thomas’ shadow last season _

at fullback. McCall will admit that
primarily blocking for Thomas’ 955
net yardage did not reach excite-
ment proportions.

He has since been switched, from
fullback to tailback and will be the
top man receiving Cummings’hand-
offs‘ during the regular season. Yet

-his running has been limited. Last
"season, on 85 attempts, McCall ran‘

for;3‘85 ‘yards. I ‘

wolves

Fazio’s Future Fortunes
[Or Lack Thereof], Fallible   

Aiding the offensive line’s open-
ings for McCall will be junior full-
back Marlon McIntyrei(6-l, 225),,
who beefed up by 15 pounds during
the offseason. His yardage stats
from last year ‘speak of similar
uncertainty as he piled up 246 on 65
carries. -.

(Up front, Fazio continues to

‘gleam like a-little kid who has just '2

received a red wagon on his birth-
day. Or is he? He is when you are
talking about the two oil-tanker
sized linemen -- Bill Fralic (6-5, 270
lbs.) and center Jim Sweeney (6-3,
250 lbs.), *

Some folks say the All-America
Fralic is up to 290, but once 260 lbs.

,in sheer muscle is surpassed, who’s

counting anymore? The leftwtackle
will easily hold his own in the
trenches. -

Next door to Fralic is guard Mike
Dorundo, a 6-3, 2501b. sophomore,
who is coming offa redshirt season.

When it comes to the offensive
line’s right side, a source of concern
creeps across Fazio’s mind like
stalking a moose. The
second-year coach had his sights
firmly set on right guard being filled
by the 245 lbs. of senior Mike Dahl.
Those sights were switched quickly,
though.

Dahl is still rehabilitating a pulled A

hamstring he suffered during the
second day of camp at Edinboro.
Replacing him is Bob Brown (6-4,

265 lbs.), a sophomore. But Brown is ’

currently listed as probable against
Tennessee as he nurses a turf toe,

‘come. Throughout the week of com-

petition, there had been numerous
disqualifications due to the discov-
ery of drugs that were being taken by

’ several of the competitors. In light of

this, Kingdom was

disappointed.
“Personally, I think it was quite

unfair the way they handled things.”

a bait

Kingdom said. ‘‘If they wanted to,

crack down on the drugs, why didn’t
they start at the World Champion-
ships. I think‘ it ruined the meet
myself.” '

For the track coaching staff, the
weekend’s developments provided
them with every bit of the emotion
and excitement that Kingdom him-
self experienced.

“I’m just happy for Roger,”
Coach John Vasvary said. “He has
worked very hard and come a long
way. After overcoming the early sea-
son obstacles that he has, Roger has

‘earned his way. We’re all veryproud

of him.”

In the eyes of the Panther sprint- -
and hurdle coach Steve Lewis, King-.

dom's victory didn’t come as that
great of a suprise. “This was the first

time, at that level of competition,
that I felt Roger should win,” he I
said. “The most exciting aspect sur-_‘ V '

rounding the victory is that from a

quality and technique point of view,‘ .'

there is still room for improvement.”

Continuing, “I’m super proud of
Roger. It’s a great feeling to see him
run now. I don’t care what anyone
says, I believe he is one of the top
three hurdlers in the world. The win
definitely brings him to the forefront
of the Olympic picture.”

4 On the quarterback’s receiving
end is the versatile All-America can-
didate, Dwight Collins.

At split end, Fazio plans on see-
ing more than the usual amount of
blocking out of junior Bill Wallace,
Julius Dawkins’s replacement.
Coming off a'redshirt year, Wallace
accumulated only 47 receiving yards
on four grabs in ‘8l.

Offensive coordinator Joe Moore
and tight-end coach Carmen Grosso

plan on making that ﬁnal offensive -

spot their baby this season. Once
graduated John Brown had his knee
retired in the Temple game last sea-
son, blocking has been a headache

for Moore. Lacking is hardly the
word.

The dark horse favorite early on
was Pat Schipani, 6-3, 225-lb. fresh-
man, but that changed what with a
sprained knee he suffered earlier.

vMaki'ng the most of the situation is

Clint Wilson who started in place of
Brown and hauled in 12 passes for
l02 yards’ and a TD. Defensive rdi-
nator Bob Junko is in his first year,
fresh out of Texas Christian, but
inherits a unito similar to the team
Fazio was handed in 1982. His big
playmaker, if you will, is All-
America Bill Maas at right tackle.

The past couple of year have been

_ vintage Maas years. The 6-2 , 225

senior has been in on 15 1/2 sacks, 76
tackles and assisted on 55 others
during that span.me line with Maas
will be Bob Buczkowski, a 6-5, 225
lb. tackle, and another sophomore,
Bob Schilken at guard. Depth pre-
vails there as Schilken just did edge
out Dennis Atiyeh for. the starting
spot.

Pass rushing will crack many a"

smile across .Iunko‘s broad face as
he goes with ﬁfth-year man Al
Wenglikowski, who made 46 stops
last year along with six sacks. Bill
Sapio (6-l, 2l5 lb.) came into camp
with a lock on the right end behind
towering Chris Doleman (6-6, 220
lb.). That is, until Doleman was
saddled with ‘academic problems
diagnosed about l0 days ago.

Doleman then was placed in
Fazio’s doghouse and was subse-
quentley lowered on the depth chart.
He and Sapio will likely split a lot of
time this year, with Doleman getting
the better of playing time.

At linebacking, Junk-o and Fazio
will look to Caesar Aldisert (6-4, 215
lbs.) and Troy Benson (6-2, 225 lbs.),
both juniors, as definite mainstays.

The defensive secondary is only
half as much fulfilling. Free safety
Tom Flynn, All-America honors
only inches from his grasp, and left

cornerback Troy Hill both give _,

some relief to assistant coach Dino
Folino’s otherwise worrisome
dilemmas.

Those dilemmas stem from plac-
ing Bill Callahan at strong safety
and starting Melvin Dean at the

right corner. Callahan came out of :

high school last year and 'ran for a
meek 10 yards at fullback. He has
since been switched and got the nod
over senior , Ray Weatherspoon
when the latter was demoted a team
for rule infractions at Edinboro dur-
ing camp’s first week.

Although Dean backed up Hill
last season, he mainly saw action on

-special teams and must now prove L

review sessions.

freshman stand-out Keith Tinsley
(5-11, 185 lbs.).

Kind of coming across as Pitt’s
silent minority, Fazio’s kicking duo
will perform far from such sugges-
tions. So silent are they that placek-
icker Eric‘ Schubert, a junior, was
mistakenly listed as a senior in the
press guide. Schubert comes off a

convincing season of making 11 of 21
field goals (still a soft thorn ‘in
Fazio’s side) and converting on 35 of
36 extra points".

Punting duties fall squarely on I

senior Tony Recchia’s foot after
booting 13 for a 38.3 average behind
Greg Ganzer. ‘ .
Make no mistake—the Pitt defen-
sive tradition will continue

of

unmatched once the gun is sounded
Saturday night. Only the usual
depth questions remain, as they do
each year.

’In a deeper sense, nothing too
shallow is evident on an offense that
will at times rely heavily on the

‘defense to pull this team through

nightmarish moments. The secret
lies in minimizing. such horror tales.

J.C. Pelusi, last year’s starting
middle guard, has made a impres-
sion in the Canadian Football
League. Pelusi started the first six
games at defensive end for Saskat-
chewan before an ankle injury side-
lined him last week. He should
return this Saturday night. The
Roughriders are currently l-6 and in
last place in the Western Division of
the CFL, »

Panther Poz°nters....

Pitt has won nine of its last 10
opening games. The last opener loss
came against Notre Dame in
l977....In'the only meeting between
Pitt and Tennessee, the Panthers
defeated the Vols, 30-6 before _the
10th largest crowd in the history of
Tennessee....The Panthers face five

1 I982 bowl teams in l983....The only

previous time the Panthers have
visited Knoxville was in 1980 when
Pitt handed the Volunteers a 30-6
defeat....With 91,000-plus expected
Saturday night, this will be the larg-
est crowd the Panthers have played
in front of since 1980 when in the
same Neyland Stadium over 94,000
saw the Panthers whip the Volun-
teers. That crowd was the 10th larg-

= , est ever for Tennessee....Against the

Volunteers three years ago, free
safety Tom Flynn received his first
starting assignment.....Iohnny
Majors has not forgotten about the
fertile Western Pennsylvania
recruiting grounds since his depar-
ture from Pitt in 1976. Three
members of the Vols hail from the
Pittsburgh area and all three figure
to see action against Pitt. Offensive
tackle Curtis Singer is from Ali-
quippa; center Glenn Streno is from
the ’Burgh’s Seton LaSalle High
School; and defensive back Mark
Hogan is a standout from the City

League's Brashear....Tennessee is

one of two Saturday evening games
the Panthers play this year, the other
being at Louisville on October 15.
Pitt started off the last season with

g two night games against North

Carolina and Florida State and won
them both. Pitt’s last night loss came
in 1980 against Florida State, a
defeat that tarnished their unde-

' feated endeavors.

Staff Sigm'ngs....

Linda M. Bruno and Peter C.
Frechette have been appointed
to newly-created staff positions
in the Big East conference,
according to commissioner Dave
Gavitt.

Bi‘-uno, currently assistant
director of athletics at Yale Uni-
versity, ‘has been appointed
director of championships. She
will have managerial responsibil-
ity for the operation of confer-
ence championships in seven
men’s and seven women's sports.

Frechette, a 1983 graduate of
Dartmouth College, served an
internship with the conference
this past year. He has been
appointed to the conference staff
as communications assistant.
Frechette will manage the con-
ference’s statistical service
bureaus and coordinate editorial
preparation of several confer-
ence publications. .

Bruno, 29, is a native of Pel-
ham Manor, N.Y. She earned
her B.A. cum laude at Iona Col-
lege in 1976 where she later was
awarded a master’s degree.
Before her appointment to the
athletic department at Yale in-
July, 1982, Bruno was assistant
athletic director at Iona for four
years. ’

Frechette, a Keene, N.H.

In reference to the Olympics,
Kingdom deﬁnitely has goals set in
_that direction. \

“I’m just going to work on train-
ing this fall, and hopefully, by the
time the Olympic trials come around
in June, I’ll be peaking,” he said.

The schedule for training in the
fall is basically set up.

“Initially, Roger will have some
time to cool down and relax,” Vas-
vary said. “This fall, he will work on
building strength that should aide
him during what should prove to be
a grueling schedule of meets slated
for l984.”

“Roger does have some unique
opportunities available to him over
the next two seasons. He could for-
seeably be a three-time NCAA
champion, having captured the title
earlier this summer. In addition, he
will be a strong contender for the
Olympics and other major titles to
be decided during the rest of his stay
at Pitt.”

The Pitt News, Wednesday August 31, I983

e Kingdom’s Flying Feet Ascend Pan Am Gold .

When one talks about Pitt ath-
letes and the Olympics, several
names come to mind beside
Kingdom.

In 1936, Panther John Woodruff
captured the gold medal in the 800-
meter run. In addition, there have
been two other former Panthers to
appear in the Olympics—Herb Dou-

glas in 1948 and Arnie Sowell in

1956.

In fact, prior to his trip to Venezu-
ela and the Pan American Games,

’ Kingdom made a visit, for what he

termed “inspiration”, to the Sports
Information Office where he ran
into the new Pitt sports information
director, Jim O’Brien. O’Brien is a
former sports columnist for The
Pittsburgh Press and author of the
book “Hail to Pitt."

While visiting with O’Brien for the
short time that he was in the office,
Kingdom learned of his Panther

forefathers betwixt the pages of the

Pitt sports history book.

“It was strange to me that this guy
who was in my office talking about

inspiration one week was a week:

later capturing the gold medal,"
O’Brien said.

‘‘It very exciting for me to see the
track and field team gaining such
national attention,” he said. “In a
way, one can compare the successes
of Roger Kingdom and the Pitt
track team to those of the Pitt foot-
ball revival through the Tony Dor-
sett era.”

For the rest of the story, well we
all know it ended with a national
championship in 1976. ,

V The‘ presence of commitment by
the university may be the only thing

that could stop the otherwise bright
outlook of the track and field pro-
gram at Pitt.

By all indications, the commit-
ment, whether Kingdom-related or
not, now appears to be there, as Pitt
athletic director .Ed Bozik made
quite clear at the football-Kingdom
press conference.

We will give Roger the opportun-
ity to run against the best competi-
tion that this country can offer,” he
said. “We’ll do every thing we can to
ensure Roger to win the gold medal
in the 1984 Olympics at Los
Angeles.”

Personally, I would say that that’s
quite a commitment from even me
most astute oftrack programs in the
country. .

In an effort to sum up what has
taken place in the past three days
since his heroics on Sunday, one
must consider that his feat, no mat-
ter how abrupt, is one ofthe greatest
accomplishments by any Pitt athlete
in the history of the school’s out-
standing tradition of excellence. It is
tough to acknowledge someone who
has grabbed such international

acclaim in such a short time, but in
the same respect, his accomplish-
ments or his future both as a track
star and as a football player should ‘
not be taken lightly.

 Early-Season Prognoses Speak Of Stupidity

2 word comes from their mental ward 2

By MARK A. SINDLER

One day, I scrubbed the fog from
my eyes, woke up and saw the light. I
know that’s what Moses said on Mt.
Sinai some eons ago, but just bear
with the thought for a few anxious
moments. -

Used to be that I would shudder at
the suggestion that I revel in some
pom-pom excitement that only col-‘
lege football could bring. Egadsll
The only interesting aspects I could
find from such national TV coverage
were the periodic pans to colorfully
clad coeds who “represent” their

respective universities while strut- "

ting their stuff on the sidelines.

Today, the NFL calls them cheer- I

leaders. Seems more like organized
gambling in the name of state lotter-
ies. Only here it’s called organized
sex.

Viewpoint

Anyway,—if it were football I was

    

going to treat my eyes to, time was .

when only the pro game would do.
Play-action passes and multi-
yardage aerials delighted thefrontal
lobotomy to no end.

Could never uncover that spine-
wrenching provocation while view-
ing college football. But, alas, those
primitive times are now behind us,
and yours truly has accordingly
altered the frontal lobotomy’s oper-
ation drastically.

And just as some look with bal-
looning eyes to the sideline shows
come fall, there is no escaping the
avalanche barrage of magazines and
newspapers which devote more

paper to preseason analyses on col- -

lege football than the federal
government does on details of its
fiscal budget.

I surely have not missed the
widely-ranging Top 20 predictions
and accompanying literature more
resembling gutter verbiage than
intriguing bedtime reading. A quick
glance can’t hurt anybody.

0A lot of resident patients at The ‘

Sporting News must know some-
thing that you and I don’t because

that Blair Kiel and Notre Dame will
finish No. lin the country.

Yes, paying zero attention to
Gerry »Faust’s 5-6 and 6-4-1 records
during his first two years with the
Fighting Irish, the guys with four-

‘leaf clovers will end up tops in the

nation. And Orsen Wells can run 10
miles a day without suffering cardiac
arrest.

0Every autumn, - Sports Illus-
trated fills mailboxes and newstand
racks with its special college and pro

a issue, second in demand to only its

annual gallery of ladies in bathing
suits. It has cranked Michigan to the
top of its Top 26 heap.

0Perhaps the only square bac -
bound periodical nearing respect -
bility in such matters is Street &
Smith's Official College Football
Yearbook. Nebraska’s Corn-
huskers, those well-bred farmboys
who annihilated Penn State 44-6
two nights ago, are S & S '3 favorite
to fulfill No. l expectations.

ONothing can match the hilarity
that Sportpmagazine confronts its
readers with. Please, don’t read this

with your mouth full. Right up
there, that’s no typographical error,
sits Tennessee. No. 1.

Someone do it soon, just pass the
Pepto Bismol.

OFinally, without any undue fan-
fare, your neighborhood gridiron
specialists, AP and UPI, have
selected Nebraska as numero uno.

Not surprisi_ngly, five different
schools from widely ranging parts of
the country are picked to survive
1983 and be deserving ofthe NCAA’s
revered halo in January. That’s even
leaving out picks by national TV
networks, the corner bookies, Las
Vegas’ bookies and moms weekly
card-playing club.

To be blunt, these’ Top 20 tracings
and any other “valuable” predic-
tions don’t mean squat. With only
differences not readily evident to the

naked eye, all publications that
come blaring out into the street these
days fall into an unavoidable trap
called Hype.

One will base its Top 20 predic-

tions on last season’s performances ,

and starters lost. Another will use
one team’s impending schedule as
compared to another‘s. Some com-
bine both of these boring tales with a
co'ach’s lifetime record and add a
dash of All-America as seasoning.
Another, specifically S], will pres-
ent an “edge-granting” look into
team offenses and defenses. Basi-
, cally, it will ‘tell you how its Top 20
members operate on both sides of
the line of scrimmage and who
exactly does what with the ball.
B-o-o-o-ring.
Then the trusty wire services rely
on an entirely different breed of per-

son. AP employs writers to spot its
Top 20, and UPI keeps a heavy con-
tingent of nationwide coaches on
hand to sustain its college’s best of
the best listing.

So you see, nothing at all can be
significantly gained by devouring
such morsels ofinformation. Publi-
cations obviously strive to give the
active better some secret tips and aid

the armchair quarterback in making ‘

his viewing hours more insightful,
what with the wife complaining that
he’s a cement-casted figure in front
of the tube.

Ironically, each Division I
school’s resting place for the season
ultimately depends solely on how it
plays towards season’s end against
the annual rivals. That’s when grit
matches grit and headphones match
headphones.

How can one not look forward to
them?

Pitt playing Penn State not with-
standing; there’s Ohio State at
Michigan [Nov. 19]; Texas at Texas
A&M [Nov. 26]; Nebraska at Okla-
homa [Nov. 26]; Florida State at
Florida [Nov. 26]; Alabama at
Auburn [Nov. 26 in Birmingham];
Arizona at Arizona State [Nov. 26];
and UCLA at USC [Nov. 19].

Once playing nine or 10 games and
such matchups as just mentioned,

national powers worthy of being.

given such a label can then be accu-
rately accorded proper Top 20
standing. 2 .

But all the college football hype
now?

A lot of trees died for no good
reason at all. -

Staunch Values Swallowed Away With Steroids

By MARK A. SINDLER

On many an occasion, the
elders can be heard saying that
nothing is sacred anymore.

Viewpoint

 

In the late-60s when numerous
dauntless young men, acne still
evident, fell into Vietnam's ter-
minal illness, a lot of equally
chivalrous souls onour college
campuses violently spoke out
against The Establishment. No
respect, the older folks would
point out,

Those same wise ones voiced
bewilderment towards the late-
70s as a domestically impartial
populace forwent the “Made in
U.S.A. ” trademark and swarmed
around the cheaper, in both price

and quality, Japanese know-
how.

“How could they?”, our
nation’s grandmas and grand-
daddies coldly remarked in fits of
distress. How come America
support Far East livelihood at
the expense of laid-off steel-
workers, autoworkers, all types
of workers?

Sanctity reached even lower
depths when a couple of
culturally- and mentally-
imbalanced individuals took it
upon themselves to end two dis-
tinguished lives. John Lennon,
almost three years removed from
our presence, never made it. The
pope, a couple of years ago, des-
pite some iffy moments, did re-
cover from his would be assasin’s
bullets.

The whispers were increasing
in treble and bass. Is hallowed-
ness forever dead? Do not waste

precious time over such a simple,
yet complex query. Simply look
back to the just-completed IX
Pan American Games in Cara-
cas, Venezuela.

International sports competi-
tion there closed on notes of
cheating, disgrace, disrepute,
scandal, deception, consterna-
tion and trepidation. Eleven
weightlifters and a cyclist failed
drug testing for, among other
banned substances, anabolic
steroids.

With judgment still recessed
on them, 13 American track and
field stars left in the second week
of competition for fear of reveal-
ing that, during the past half
year, they indeed were internally
administering illegal drugs.
Sophisticated testing can record
results from that far back.

Surprise should not be vented
over the fact that steroids—a
synthetic form of the male hor-
mone testosterone——flagrantly

used at the games, but that the
substances were actually tested
positive. A long time in coming it
is.

Notice has been adequately
served in time for the 1984
Summer Games in Los Angeles.
But no one can erase the ugly
graffiti on the wall that has
already appeared.

Forget that major league play-
ers here in the states use refined
powder from Brazil. Forget that
alcoholism may be running a
close second to the white stuff.
Anabolic steroids are now the
big thing. Make it required read-
ing of the writing on the wall.

In the sports that require par-
ticipants with intense muscle
strength, the scores may never be
the same. We will never know
not whether those fellows use the
bulk-increasing drug, but
whether their using it has any
effect on final outcomes.

Call it cheating. A better word
is hard to come by. Just ask some
western athletes who have
recently commented on the near
impossibility of topping other
athletes in the Eastern Bloc
countries. Not only the Russian
umbrella nations, but the Rus-
kies themselves.

Westerners say the only way is
to use steroids. It will give them
an edge. An edge, all right. But
an unfair one at that.

By posing this communistic
bias, I cannot withhold any hy-
potheses that Russians and their
neighboring counterparts have
indeed used steroidsin past inter-
national events. The possibilities
are wholly valid.

Similarly efficacious are the
words of today’s sages, older
folks who “have been there
before.” Is nothing more sacred
today?

A Pressing Need
To Look Around

By_ CHARLIE O‘HAliA

It was high noon as I entered the
Oakland room of the University Inn,
where the initial football press con-
ference of the 1983 season was to be
held. It was my chance to join the
other members of the Pittsburgh

. sports media.

The first order of business was

, what else: to grab a seat and get

ready to enjoy as well as engage
those whom I had come to consider
the experts, at least in this town. ,

At my table, among others, were
Stan Savran of Channel 4, Bob
Smizik of The Post Gazette,, Tom
McMillen also of The Post Gazette,
and our very own Mark A. Sindler,
the sports editor of The Pitt News.

After a bit of chatter concerning"

the slaughter of Penn State‘ by
Nebraska the previous evening, the
corps was ready to begin. , _

Enter the new sports intormation
director, Jim O’Brien. He made his
way to the telephone at the front of
the room, and after pulling the
necessary strings, he had Johnny
Majors, head coach of the Tennessee
Volunteers on the line.

Before the actual wrap session
between media and coaches was to
begin, there was an interim declara-
tion by O’Brien concerning the
weekend’s activities in Caracas,

Venezuela, where Panther junior
hurdler Roger Kingdom captured
the gold medal.

yesterday's media luncheon.

Among those acknowledging
Kingdom’s efforts were FogeFazio,
who has coached him in football for
the preious two seasons and decided
to give him a one-year excuse from

Various scribes gathered around Pitt ‘footba coaches oge Fazio n

football. to train for the 1984 Olym-
pic Games, athletic director Dr. Ed
Bozik, who assured everyone pres-
ent that the Pitt athletic department
was going to do everything in its

 

eisen er

- Oi JunRo‘a‘f

 

power to allow Kingdom’s dreams
tobecome reality.

After all that, we were ready to
begin.

O’Brien announced thatcoaches
Bob Junko and Foge Fazio would
be seated at the center of the table,
but moreimportantly that Myron

Cope would be given whatever seat‘?

he wished, due to his hearing, or so
he said. '

After almost every question it
seemed that Cope was given the
opportunity to ask an additional
questionor an additional wisecrack,
whichever he felt was appropriate at
the particular time.

For instance, he asked Bob Junko
what he thinks about being referred
to as ‘Junk.’ Junko rep_i_ed he’d been
called a lot worse.

Another of the more humorous
subjects of debate was the former
Illinois offensive coordinator turned
Tennessee offensive coordinator.
Cope wondered aloud if the Tennes-
see attack was going to be much like
the potent Illinois attack of ‘82,
made famous by Tony Eason.

Fazio had one wish for the Ten-
nessee squad, “last year’s blocker’s.”
(In the contest back in ‘82, the
Panthers made nine sacks out of
“Champagne Tony”).

At the close of the discussion,
A.D. Bozik’ made one more-
announcement, this one concerning
Marlon Ferguson and the chauffer
ordeal that almost lead to his dis-
qualification. Anyway, -Bozik said
that the.case was closed and that no
institutional sanction would be
given. ‘

As far as the Brozovich issue is
concerned, Bozik said that‘ the
NCAA is still under deliberation as

what will happen.

The last order of business at this
gathering of sportsnicks'was that of v
television. “Foge” and “Junk” went
into the back room for the inter-
views with the voice of the Panthers
Bill Hillgrove for WTAE-TV and
then to Dec Thompson for the
WPXI News. ’

As the room cleared, there was
only Roger Kingdom and three
eager reporters with their micro-
phones stuffed almost in the mouth
of the school’s newest star.

It was now time’ for me to leave
until next Tuesdayand the Temple
preview. I
