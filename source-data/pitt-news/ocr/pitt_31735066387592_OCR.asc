Alcohol  
Awareness
Week
begins

By Jason Hillman.
Staff Writer

Today marks the official begin-
ing of National Alcohol Aware-
ness Week, and for the past two
weeks, Pitt has held events on the
subject of responsiblity and
alcohol.

”Actually, what we do here at
Pitt doesn't line up with Nation-
al Awareness Week,” said Jon
Conlogue, assistant director of
Resident Life. ”The basic reason
for that is that we start earlier than
many schools do, and we like to
do the alcohol awareness educa-
tion earlier than most schools.”

On Oct. 7 and 8, tables were
set up in the Towers Lobby. A
variety of pamphlets were avail-
able, ranging from one on Alco-
holics Anonymous to one on a
National Alcohol Awareness Test
to one on the Will Rogers In-
stitute.

Terry Moore, a GSA in health
‘education, was also there. ’’I was
basically doing, with the Campus

‘Police, the breathalyzer demon-

stration — sort of connecting with
what blood-alcohol content
means and such."

There was also a machine
which made non—alcoholic
drinks, called ”mocktails.”

”[There’s] a machine that's
usually at the Union, and it
makes four different drinks: mar-
garitas, pina coladas, banana
coladas and strawberry daiquiris,
mixed without alcohol, and they
taste so good you can't tell the
difference," said Conlogue.

On Thursday night, the Fiji
fraternity sponsored an alcohol
awareness program in the Union.
Moore also spoke at this event,
which was open to the public,
but only a few showed up — ”10
to 12,” according to Moore.

This week, D.A.R.E. (Drug and
Alcohol Responsible Education),
headed by President Dwight Ho-
man, is planning to put a car that
was in an alcohol-related acci-
dent in front of the Student Un-
ion Monday through" Wednesday.

”It’s going to be a silent tes-
timony to what happens when
people drink and drive,” said
Conlogue.

”Very positive, for most peo-
ple, and for the kids in the Tow-
ers, too,” said Moore, on the
reaction to the alcohol awareness
movement, ”They had a lot of

UF addresses part-time faculty

By Scot Ross
Staff Writer

Driven bythe belief that part-
time faculty and librarians are
given second—class status, the
United Faculty has been organiz-
ing this group of people to
represent their professional rights.

The United Faculty, an organi-
zation of University of Pittsburgh
professors, is holding elections,
asking part—time faculty and
librarians if they wish for the UF
to represent them during collec-
tive bargaining with the universi-
ty's aministration.

According to Professor Jane
Flanders, chairperson of the cam-
paign committee, ”The issues
about which part—time faculty are
concerned can be summed up in
one phrase — professional recog-
nition.” _ 4

The part-timers play a vital role

at the university, according tothev

UF. As the number of part-time
employees increases, the group

feels that Conditions must‘ im-‘

prove, so that these instructors
can meet the rising academic

— needs of the students:

The group stated that its inten-
tions are: increasing salaries, im-
proving working conditions,
improving the attitude about part-
timers throughout the university

and creating better methods for‘

hiring and acquiring part—time in-
structors.

Also, the committee believes
that part—time faculty deserve a
say in the university's govern-
mental decisions.

Professor Philip Wion, presi-
dent of the United Faculty, said
that ”for one thing, salaries need
to be improved. There needs to
be pro-rating. People in the
department should make a
proportion of money of full-time
professors,” depending on the
percentage of classes they teach
in relation to those of the
full—time'r. '

”Salaries vary widely, ranging
from about $1,000 to $3,000 per.

course. Health benefits are avail-'

 

able on a limited basis to some
part-timers but not to [every
part—timer].”

Wion explained that poor
working conditions are inhibiting
the performance ' of the part-
timers as well. ”[Part—time instruc-
tors] need offices to meetlwith
students,” he commented.
Others need mailboxes, tele-
phone services and secretarial
aid.,He noted that students are
often unable to Contact part-
timers becausethey have no
campus phone’ listing.

The UF also argues that ”ex—
plicit criteria” for hiring part—time
employees is needed to ”prevent
arbitrary personnel decisions.”

In order to encourage the
professional development of
these instructors, the university
must ‘offer research and ‘travel
funding, as they attempt to enrich
their classrooms. As well, there
should be a.”tuition remission for
study at Pitt.” '

‘A vote is tenatively scheduled
for November. . ' ' T

disease  
§.W.‘.-‘.Zl‘ R’ B'°‘”"

Recent disclosures that the E

water supply in Oakland, and
surrounding neighborhoods such
as Squirrel Hill and Shadyside,
was contaminated with Legion-

aire’s disease has many citizens .0

concerned for their health.
While legionella pneumonia
occurs naturally in our water sup-
ply, research performed locally
by Pitt students and staff stripped
away the myth and uncertainty
surrounding the disease when an

outbreak killed 34 Legionaires at .

a convention in Philadelphia 11
years_ago. ,

”Fortunately, the bacteria can
_be detected. Research has shown
that it's prime breeding ground
are hot water tanks and humidi-

fiers, though it can also appear in .

ice chests. Once detected, a regi-
men of hot-water flushing and
hyperchlorination’usually eradi-
cates potable water of the
legionella bacteria,” said Dr. Vic-
tor L. Yu, of the university school
of medicine and VA hospital's
Department of Infectious

- Diseases.

”Even more fortunately, the

disease only affectsa small seg— T

ment of the population. Heavy
smokers, those who just under-
went transplant surgery, or those
who are ill are the most sucepti-
ble,” said Yu. ”The experts on
this disease are all from this area.

Pitt graduate students Paul Mura-

ca, Janet Stout and Ying Yee are
the people who made the break-
throughs.”

Once Legionaire’s disease is di-

agnosed, the therapy is a non-

toxic anti-biotic available any-
where. Erythromycin is best for
this, but if it is misdiagnosed, if

it appears just to be another A

pneumonia, there is a 20 percent

mortality rate. The wrong me_di-_ “

cine will not cure this,” reported
Yu.

Legionaire’s disease has been
located in hospital water sup-

plies, where it can prove fatal to -  . 

those who have just undergone
surgery due to the presence of a_
trachial tube which was rinsed in
tap water infected with the
legionella bacteria.

The disease also flourished in =

shower heads, water faucets and

‘ humidifiers. The water systems of . A A _.

THE PITT NEWS,lMond‘ay, October 19, 1987

 

MANAMA, Bahrain — The Ira-
nian missile that wrecked a U.S.-

‘ flagged tanker was ”a lucky shot"

that could have hit Kuwait's oil

_termina| complex or several other

ships in the area, U.S. military

sources said Sunday.

Kuwaiti officials lodged a for-
mal protest with Tehran. Iran's

“foreign minister virtually ac-

knowledged Iran launched the
missile Friday and hinted at more
attacks.

In Tehran, Iranian officials ac-

The four were repatriated to Iran

U.S. and Kuwaiti officials who
inspected the ship Saturday con-
cluded the missile was a Chinese-

sources said. Officials said it was
fired from Iran-held territory in
the southern Faw peninsula, 50
miles to the northeast from where
the tanker sat in Kuwaiti waters.

The blast injured 18 crew
members, blinding the American
captain and a Filipino sailor, ac-
cording to medical sources in
Kuwait. Six remained hospital-

ly chided right-wing Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir on Sun-
day, urging him to take the risk
to explore new options for peace.
”No one helps the chances for
peace by doing nothing,” Shultz
said. ”Those who are reluctant to
explore new ideas or even revisit
old ones have an obligation to
offer something different as an al-
ternative to the status quo.”
His remarks in a speech at the

-Weizmann Institute in Rehovot

were seen as a prod to Shamir,
although he did not mention the
prime minister by name.

Shultz’s mission of peace,
which began Friday, met with a
setback when a group of eight
Palestinian leaders refused to
meet him. ' _

Violent protests continued in
the Israeli-occupied West Bank
and Gaza City against Shultz’s
visit, the Arab-owned Palestine
Press Service said. A 12-year-old
boy was wounded in the protests,
the agency said.

Liquor Contol Board
considers fee increase

HARRISBURG — A new re-
quirement that the state's liquor
enforcement pay for itself may
force up some licensing fees by
nearly 350 percent, according to
a published report.

Fee increases are being consi-
dered by the Liquor Control
Board to generate an extra $17
million for licensing and enforce-
ment, The Sunday Patriot-News
reported. Current fees fall far
short of the $23 million cost of
licensing and enforcement this
fiscal year.

Anotheroption would be a -

reduction in the 12.5 percent dis-
count" that liquor licensees now
receive on their liquor purchases.

If approved by the Legislature,
new fees would be imposed on
breweries, distilleries, wineries,
restaurants with Sunday sales per-

No need to set out an
extra dish for Reagan

EVANS CITY, Pa. — When
Sheila Nagy invited President
Reagan to have dinner with her
”normal American family,” she
asked him to telephone in ad-
vance, so she'd have time to
defrost extra meat.

Saturday afternoon,’as Rea-
gan’s wife Nancy recuperated
from breast cancer surgery, Mrs.
Nagy got a phone call from the
president, not to say that he was
coming but to personally express
his regret that other commitments
prevented him from accepting
the invitation.

”But he said he and Nancy

might take us up on it some other

time,” Mrs. Nagy said.

I When Mrs. Nagy picked up the
telephone about 4:30 p.m., an‘
operator asked her to hold for the
president, she said. She was so
startled, she asked, ”The presi-

. dent of what?”

Derby Days to benefit Rehab Institute

By Stephanie Gruich

For The Pitt News

Derby Days is a National Sig-
ma Chi project to help local char-
ities. Pitt’s Sigma Chis raised
$3,000 for the Rehabilitation In-
stitute of Pittsburgh this past week

with the help of eight sororities
and their own Little Sisters.
”This year we had more girls
sign up but little participation,”
said Jeff S. Bickart, chairman of
Derby Days. Out of the nine
teams, five were really interested;
however, Bicker said, ”We raised

The Sigma Chi fraternity
held a ”first” event this year as
part of its annual Derby Days

charity event to benefit the Re-
habilitation Institute of
Pittsburgh.

Thursday night, the ”Sig-N-
Dales,” modeled after the
Chippendale dancers, per-
formed for a crowd of female
students, mostly from the var-
ious sororities on campus.

Doug Bennett, Public Rela-
tions chairman of Derby Days,
said, ”We hoped something
like this would help us raise
more money.”

Dancers stripped down to
G—strings, which were donat-
ed by Drawers, located on

Sigma Chis take it off

the ”Sig-n-dales,” said the idea

118 Meyran Ave. ‘
Craig Forrester, chairman of

for the dancers was conceived
about two months ago.

This is the seventh consecu-
tive year Sigma Chi has spon-
sored Derby Days. ”We want
the dancers to be a tradition,
though,” said Derby Days
chairman Jeff Bickart.

I In all, 28 men performed,
each with a theme outfit and
music of their choice. _
1 Several women, who asked
to remain anonymous, re-
vealed their expectations for
the show. ”We paid our $3;

we want to see some skin.”

at least 30 percent more this year '

than last.”

Craig Forrester explained,
”With the addition of Sig-N-
Dales, it was a major influence
on our increase of money. It will
happen again next year.

”Next year, it's going to be big-
ger and better,” said Forrester.

The girls had fun watching, but
they also had fun participating in
”Fun & Games” Friday afternoon
on the Cathedral lawn. ”The
games were like ones we all used
to play when we were little and
at camp,” said Bickart.

”Hire—a—Helper was also excit-
ing because it was the biggest
money raiser,” said Bickart. The
idea was to purchase a brother or
pledge, auction style, and inden-
ture the services of that person for
a day.

All teams received points
throughout the week. And in the
end, they were given awards.
This took place Saturday at
Peter's Pub. ”We split the money
with Peter's. Iron City donated all
the beer for the week,” said
Bickart.

Kappa Kappa Gamma won the
overall award as well as coming
in first in Canning, Fun & Games

This year we had
more girls sign up but
little participation. We
raised at least 30 per-
cent more this year
than last.

Conlogue said he believes
that this awareness program is
important. ”The vast majority
of situations that we deal with,
both in the residence halls,
and I'm sure, outside the resi-
dence halls from the [students]
of the university are alcohol
related,” said Conlogue‘.
”Many students come to col-
lege already having an alcohol
problem. Many students de-

they're at college.”

Course on activism

will be featured at

Temple next spring  

By Lee Mitgang

AP Education Writer

‘PHILADELPHIA —— At most
campuses, social activism is
regarded as slightly more worthy
than football or hockey but hard-
ly a serious academic pursuit.

Temple University is one that
thinks otherwise. Next spring, the
school will offer a highly unusual
course, for academic credit, titled
”Vo|untarism and Community
Organization.”

The course, which will be open
to 15 to 20 students, aims to
teach them how to succeed as so-
cial and political activists, and
will even require an internship
with one of the 400 or so
community-based volunteer or-

ganizations in the Philadelphia _

area.

The course will be taught by as-
sistant sociology professor Ron-
nie Steinberg, a self-described
”daughter of Republican par-
ents” who discovered anti-war
politics and feminism in the
19605 as an undergraduate at
Bennington College.

One guest lecturer is sure to be
Bobby Seale, the fiery Black Pan-
ther Party leader and antiwar ac-
tivist of the 1960s who is now a
50-year-old Temple graduate stu-
dent in. political science.

Temple thus joins a small but

growing number of universities
that regard voluntarism and
philanthropy as legitimate sub-
jects for academic study. And in
Temple's case, the decision also
reflects the belief that universities
must take greater responsibility
for the current state of apathy

’ among students.

Temple was one of 16 colleges
and universities awarded grants
of $15,000 each in the last two
years by the Association of
American Colleges to establish
such courses. Most are still in the
planning stages.

At least two schools are starting
such courses this fall. Harvard
University is offering an econom-
ics‘ course, ”Social Problems of
the American Economy,” ex-
amining philanthropy and volun-
tary activity. And a new political
science course at Seton Hall
University in South Orange, N.J.,
will examine the rise of founda-
tions and charities. '

_ ‘But Temple's course stands out '
V in combining academics with

real-world experience.

Programs promoting student
voluntarism and activism ”tend
to be downplayed at most
schools. They are usually run by
a non-academic unit, like the
office of student affairs,” said Lois
Cronholm, dean of Temple's col-
lege of arts and sciences. ’’I think
that's symbolic of thefact that
academic leaders tend to down-
play the intellectual content of
these activities.”

Another reason Temple is tak-
ing student activism so seriously
these days is the presence on
campus since 1985 of Seale, still
a committed and outspoken ac-
tivist who serves as a liaison for
the universityito community

, groups in Philadelphia. He lec-

tures at 25 to 30 campuses a year
and plans to be a guest lecturer
for the new Temple course.

‘Seale’ helped organize two
months of conferences at Temple
this fall exploring the current state
of social activism. A

The first such gathering took
place last week, and featured
talks by education reformer Er-
nest L. Boyer, philanthropist Ge-
orge Pillsbury, actor Elliott
Gould, defense attorney William
Kunstler, and Rennie Davis and
Tom Hayden, who were co-
defendants with Seale in the
Chicago 8 trial in 1969.

Other '60s icons, including
former New York congresswom-
an Bella Abzug and Chicago 8
co-defendents Jerry Rubin, David
Dellinger, Lee Weiner and Abbie
Hoffman, are scheduled to speak
at Temple seminars on social

   

responsibility through

November.

Who will recall  
when they've gone?

Temple University in Philadelphia will institute a class next
spring designedto teach students about college activism. The
class, fo_r -15 to 20 students, will seek to examine the intellec-
tual interests of political and social activists. Students will be
requiredto serve an internship at one of the local community
activist groupsto complete the course. ’ A '

For most of the present decade, college students have fared ‘

poorly in comparisonto.-the -politically aware students of the

late '60s and early '70s. Accusations of student apathy have

been ringing around colleges with growing intensity.
Development of the course was funded by the American As-

. sociation of Colleges to combat the falling political interest and

knowledge on college campuses. U nderstandably, they are con-

cerned today’s students will find themselves thrown into a_ world _

about which they know very little.  ‘ _ _

One has to wonder, though, whether it is possible to teach
the value of being concerned in the classroom. Hopefully, any-
one taking the class will gain more than an understanding of
the mechanics of political protest. Hopefully, they will become
more curious about the events shaping their lives, and to some
extent, their thoughts.

There certainly is much to be said for the necessity of politi-
cal dialogue on college campuses. Many of the successful pro-
tests in the past have had much of their support in the academic
commmunity. .

While there is the possibility classes such as the one at Tem-
ple will prove to be only a lifeless study of past movements,
there is a good bit of positive effect they could have.

We would all do well to study the recent past more closely
to try to understand the things happening in the government.
If Pitt were to institute such a class, any student taking it would
probably be the better for the experience.

LETTER
Finding a little

room for tolerance

A little, roofless, three-walled tabernacle. Sitting quietly. in the
shadow of the Pitt Cathedral. A place where college students meet
to pray, eat and socialize. In this 6-by—8 hut, little girls in their father's
arms look up in wonder at the fruits strung from the leaves covering
this little room, built to last for one week, in rememberance of the
tabernacles Jews lived in while wandering in thedesert.

This little structure, flimsy yet strong, is what I expected to see on
its plot of grass between Pitt and CMU when I walked there Monday
morning to pray with a friend before breakfast and classes. Instead,
it was on its side, smashed to the ground. Leaves everywhere (the
roof is made of branches laying across the top, so the stars will be
visible), decorations ripped apart. Colorful fruits smashed into the
grass. ,

We built this structure so as to allow college students, community
families and their children from CMU and Pitt (and anyone else in-
terested) to celebrate the holiday of Sukkot for one week. We only
wanted 48 square feet to rejoice in our holiday. But some other. peo-

ple don't want to allow happiness in another person's religion._

Perhaps a little more tolerance for other’s beliefs and feelings isorder.

W5 0” lY getting   more too li/3 

V Every so often, I'll rise earlyon I

Sunday morning to .get a jump on

the tail-end of the weekend. Over

breakfast, I'll flip through cable-
TV channels looking for some-
thing amusing to watch. Invaria-
bly, I settle on religious
programming. .

. . One Sunday, I watched asyn-
dicated, Qhristgian gamieshow ,
called The one -Way sh'ow‘,‘ the-

title for which, I suppose, indi-
cates that those involved with the

‘ program had indeed found the

”one way” to eternal life, or
something like that.

The show’s host, a portly and
obnoxiously happy-go—lucky
dude, presented himself in typi-
cal evangelical form, right down
to his hair, which was neatly
groomed to the point where it
looked unreal (and it very well
may have been).

. lmploring his home viewers to
read their Bibles regularly, the
host explained that if we all took

the time to put "The Word” into ‘

our heads, God would help us to
pull it back out again. To-prove
his point, he opened'the game
and proceeded to firequestions
at two teams of youngsters, none
of whom looked a day over 12
years old. I

”What New Testament person
used to be a cupbearer but turned
out to be an engineer?” the host
barked.

Without hesitation, one of the
youngsters sounded the buzzer,
got the ”go” from her teammates
and answered, quite matter-of-
factly, ”Nehemiah!”

I'll admit that secular game
shows leave a lot to be desired.
I wouldn't watch’ The New Dat-
ing Came any more than I would
have watched the old one. But a
Christian game show? Isn't this
TV fundamentalism getting a bit

‘ out of hand?

I have nothing against Bible

studies. But as I watched The .

_One Way game, I couldn't help

but wonder: Where do these kids .

one of my playmates, regardless .

of the depth of their family's reli-
gious commitment, could
respond to questions concerning
the text of the Bible as proficient-

“ Iy as the One Way kids. To me,

these kids are three parts amus-
ing and one part scary. Short of
brainwashing, I don't know how
else such rote could be achieved.

On another Sunday morning,
again I was buzzing through

channels when I landed on what I

I thought was studio wrestling. I
was wrong. I had run intothe
most ridiculous of ridiculous re-
ligious programs. Picture this: a
studio wrestling evangelist.
Dressed in typical ”Hulkma-
nia” garb, this man pranced
about the ring preaching the
Gospel to a sports pavilion
packed with people, mostly
young. He railed against every-
thing from premarital sex to rock
’n’ roll, which wasn't anything
new. So why the big crowd?
This guy, whose name escapes
me for good reason, had his
wrists bound with chains behind

Bible-spewing automatons? ~

ence between this sort of.‘ T

proselytizing — I call it psycho-
logical kidnapping — and the
supposed mind—twisting charac-

teristics of drugs and rock ’n’ roll? '

I would ‘prefer for my kids -to
look life in the eye, accept it, deal
with it and make it work for them.

‘All this evangelical nonsense is

his back. As he psychedhimself“

with heavenly banter, thus raising
the dramatics of the event to a
nauseating level, he snapped the
chains with nothing more than

the ”power of the Lord.”

_ Next, he asked those who
wanted and needed to be saved
to come forward. And like lem-
mings rushing madly toward the

just a way of evading reality. And, I
as anyone knows, you can't .

evade reality forever.

I remember a line from a‘

Cheech and Chong (those unbri-
dled heathens) album that goes
something like this: Before I
found the Lord, I was messed up
on drugs. But since I found the
Lord, I'm messed up on the Lord.’

Moderation in all things, holy
and otherwise, please.

Panthers lose Goodson for entire season

By John Enright
Editor in Chief

Pitt coach Paul Evans con-
firmed last Thursday that Mike
Goodson, last year's starting
point guard, will not play for the
Panthers the entire season be-
cause he failed to register for two

fall—semester classes needed to.

regain his eligibility.
Goodson, a 6-foot-3 junior
from Elizabeth, N.J., who aver-

aged eight points and 4.8 assists
per game last season, was origi-
nally ruled ineligible for the fall
semester because he failed to ob-
tain grades in an English class and
a mathematics course.

If Goodson had completed
those grades during the fall
semester, he would have been
able to return to the team after
eight games and would have
been ready for the Panthers Big
East Conference opener at Geor-

getown Ian. 6.

But now Goodson couldn't
play basketball this season even
if he registered for the winter
term.

”Goodson was a big loss, espe-
cially because of his defense. We
_don’t have'a guard as physical as
Mike,” said Evans.

Evans said he's heard rumors
that Goodson may transfer to
another school, but he isn't sure
that's the case. '

Evans said he hasn't talked to
Goodson in over a month.

In Coodson’s absence, Pitt will
rely on sophomore Pat
Cavanaugh and freshmen Sean
Miller and Jason Matthews,

Cavanaugh, a walk-on last
year, was given a full scholarship

after making great improvement .

this summer. He may be the

front-runner for the starting posi-

”After they scored that touch-
down in the second quarter [a
20-yard Kiel toss to Walter Mur-
ray], we knew we gavé them
some momentum,” said safety
Donnie Shell. ”We went right af-
ter them and caused some pretty

Tied at 7-7 early in the fourth

impressive 20-yard touchdown
catch by rookie regular running
back Merril Hoge. '

Two Kiel interceptions later,
the Steelers found themselves
with the football deep in Colt ter-
ritory. Traps to running backs Er-
nest Jackson and rookie Dwight
Stone trudged the Steelers to the
10, then back Chuck Sanders
swept untouched through the left
side of the defense for the game's
final score and Indianapolis’ final

Georgetown beats itt soccer team,

By Vince Carey
Staff Writer

The Georgetown Hoyas defeat-
ed the Pitt Panthers, l-0, in one
of the most exciting soccer games
of the season this past Saturday at
Pitt Stadium.

”This was a tough loss,” said
Pitt head coach Joe Luxbacher.
”We had our chances but just
couldn't get it done.”

When the whistle blew to start
the game, both teams had fire in
their eyes. There was a clash in
the middle of the field, and Pitt
ended up with the ball. They
drove down the field and pushed
into the net. However, the Hoyas
held tough and took over the ball.

Then it was time for the Pitt
defense to show what they're
made of. Georgetown took the
ball across midfield and had an
open shot ongoal. This is where
Pitt goalie lay Kapusta, making
his second start of the season,
took over. He dove to his right to
knock the ball away then jumped
up to knock it away again. The
Hoyas were turned away.

”Jay played a great game to
keep us in it,”_said Pitt playerjon
Ascher. ”We expected them to
play a good, physical game. We
moved the ball_good, but just
couldn’t take advantage of our
chances."

The defenses now took over.
Whenever either team tried to go
on an attack, they were quickly
turned away. Then with about 30
minutes left in the half, Pitt
moved the ball down the field.
They couldn't quite put the ball

-into the net, and Georgetown

eventuallyhtook control.

”We did what we wanted to do
today,” said Hoya assistant coach
Tom Graham. ”We held onto the
ball and made things happen.”

Georgetown moved down the
field and kept the pressure on for
almost the rest of the half. Fresh-
man Kapusta held tough and
didn't let anything get by him.

With about 20 seconds left be-
fore halftime, Pitt’s Erim Gude
stole the ball and ran down field.
Both of the Georgetown defen-
sive backs converged on him,
and he was able to get the ball
over to Mike Grimes. The pass
put the Hoyas in a terrible posi-
tion, but Grimes lost control of
the ball; Georgetown recovered,
and the game remained scoreless
as the half ended.

‘ ”l’m satisfied with the way the
team played,” said Georgetown
head coach Keith Tabatznik.
”We only allowed a few pressure
situations, so‘ I'm very pleased.”

The second half started out the
same as the first. Pitt moved
down the field but was turned
away. The Hoyas took the ball
away and moved down the field.

Georgetown ended up with a
sidekick. They put the ball across
the middle, and Michael Moylan
knocked it in to give his team a
1-0 lead.

”We played very good today,”
said Grimes. ”The game was
even except for one cheap goal.
We still had a lot of opportunities
to get it back though.”

The Panther offense now came
alive. They hit all of the passes
and easily moved the ball down
the field. Every time they would
get in close, ‘they would be
turned away.._ The little extra was
not/on the ball to"put it past the
goalie.   "

”This was one‘ ofthe -better

garnet. that .

Georgetown captain Andrew Lo-
gan. ”We played solid both
halves. Our defense was very
tough the whole time.”

The ball went back and forth,
with both teams trying to score.
Both goalies made a number of
big saves, to keep the score the
same.

_Then with 17 minutes left in
the game, Grimes took the ball
down the field and was heading
for a one—on-one confrontation
with the goalie. But this was not
to be because a Hoya player
jumped on his back to stop the
chance. Pitt was awarded a
penalty shot for this.

The tension grew as senior Pan-
ther Dave Moss placed the ball
on the ground for the penalty
shot. The ref blew the whistle,
and Moss tried to fake the goalie
out. He shot the ball, but John
Janenda came up with the play of
the day by diving to his right to
preserve his shutout. ‘

This was the last real

  SYRACUSE, N.Y. — The na-

 tion's college football fans saw a

man and a team make a point
Saturday -— and in a most em-
phatic way.

“I think I made a statement to-
day about my claims to the Heis-

man Trophy,” said senior

quarterback Don McPherson af-
ter' passing for three touchdowns,
rushing for two others and en-
gineering 13th-ranked Syracuse's
48-21 rout of No. 10 Penn State.

we are a legitimate football team
this year,” said Orangemen
coach Dick MacPherson.
Syracuse, playing on national
television and before a frenzied
sell-out crowd of 50,000, domi-
nated Penn State on both sides of
the ball in defeating the Nittany
Lions for the first time since 1970
and the first time at home since
1965. The win moved the
Orangemen to 6-0, the best start
since its undefeated national
championship season in 1959.
McPherson teamed with Rob
Moore on an 80-yard touchdown
pass on the first play from scrim-
mage, and by the time the start-

ers went to the bench in the third
quarter, Syracuse had built an in-
surmountable 41-0 lead, scoring
on six of its first seven posses-
sions. Penn State, which fell_to
5-2, scored three touchdowns
against the Orangemen’s
reserves.

On offense, even though Gary
Brown scored the first rushing
touchdown this season against
Syracuse, it was a similar saga for
the Nittany Lions. Penn State was
held to 76 yards total offense in
the first half and could muster just
11 first downs in the game. The
Syracuse defense recorded one
fumble recovery, three intercep-

tions and three quarterback sacks.

”They took it easy on us. It
could have been worse,” said
Penn State Coach Joe Paterno,
who only wanted to talk about
Syracuse after the game.

So impressed was the great Nit-
tany Lion coach, that hevpaid a
visit to the Orangemen locker
room. '

”You’re a great team. This was
a great win. Keep the champion-
ship in the East,” he said.

Paterno was doubly impressed
with McPherson, who ‘collected
375 yards total offense and set a
Syracuse single-game passing
record with 339 yards, breaking

“As for the Heisman, l have
shown that the voters should start
looking to the Northeast, to Syra-
cuse for a candidate,” said
McPherson, who has 1,322 yards
offense and 14 touchdowns this
season.

Lady Panther senior starter Lisa
Stewart was the most consistent
player throughout the game,
fighting hard when some of her
teammates were having trouble.

Stewart helped rally Pitt from a‘

8-11 deficit in the second game
to a 15-11 win.

Penn State toughened up in the
third game, playing solid defense.
Pitt, because of effective Penn
State blocking, began to try tip-
ping over the blockers at the net,
but the Lady Lions still ran upan
8-2 lead. The Lady Panthers
managed to stay close at 6-9 on
two aces by junior Krista Ziener.

After struggling to within three
points, 8-11, Stewart took over.
The Lady Panthers rolled off six
straight points with Stewart serv-
ing. Frawley also played an im-
portant part in the run as Pitt
came back to win the third game,
15-13.

The Lady Panthers had a strong

start in the fourth game, shutting
down Penn State offensively with
improved blocking. Senior Louise
O’Shaughnessy served two aces
to give Pitt a 6-3 lead. But the
Lady Lions once again fought
back to take a 7-6 lead.

But Frawley, who blossomed in
this game, made'key spikes, lead-
ing Pitt back into the lead, 9-7.

The game continued to waver
with Penn State scoring four
straight points to recover-the lead.
But O’Shaughnessy played
strongly, serving an ace and
teaming up with Stewart to tie the
game, 11-11. Stewart then took
over, getting her own ace giving
Pitt a 13-11 lead.

Penn State would not give up,
however, and tied the game at
14-14 after blocking a potential
match point by Frawley. The
Lady Lions took the lead, but
served out of bounds.

Later in the game O’Shaugh-
nessy connected a set with
Stewart to give Pitt a 16-15 lead

and then Stewart tipped in the
winning point.

Collier, commenting on the
O’Shaughnessy—Stewart tandem,
said, ”They’re two seniors and
they wanted it really bad and I
think they probably just looked at

each other and said ‘We're going

to make it happen’ and they did.”

Stewart was especially jubilant
about the victory. ”l loved it. This
was the first time" I ever beat Penn
State."

Stewart's performance last
night may have ‘been because
Penn State keyed on Frawley. ’’It
was challenging offensively be-

‘cause they had two blockers on

me most of the time,” Frawley
said. .

”[Penn State] blocked [Frawley]
some and she is one of our best
spik'ers and anybody who blocks
her is doing good,” said Collier.
”We started mixing it up a little
more instead of only going to
Denise."

The victory gives the Lady Pan-
thers a 25-2 recordwith the only
losses coming against Purdue and
Nebraska.

Last Friday night Pitt defeated
Houston at Fitzgerald _Field
House in what Collier called
”probably the biggest win of the
season.” The Lady Panthers
defeated Houston in five games.

In the final game Pitt was
down, 14-11, when they made‘a
terrific comeback to pull out the
win, 17-15.

players in the country,” said
McPherson. ' 4

And Syracuse proved itself one
of the nation's top teams and si-
lenced those who have been dis-
missing their unbeaten record as
a result of a weak schedule.

”We peaked out. We hit all
cylinders today,” said noseguard
Ted Gregory. "This makes us
legitimate. This shows the whole
country that we're for real.”

It took Syracuse 10 seconds to '

show Penn State how real it was
Saturday. That’s how long it took
for Moore to cover 80 yards and
give the Orangemen a 7-0 lead.

”We didn't expect them to
come so quick and jump out on
top of us like they did,” said Penn
State receiver Ray Roundtree.

Kicker Tim Vesling added field
goals of 37 and 35 yards on the
Orangemen’s next two posses-
sions to give Syracuse a 13-0 lead
at the end of the first quarter.

McPherson threw the first of
two touchdown passes to Tommy
Kane, a 29—yarder on a third—and-
goal-to-go play, to give Syracuse

, a 20-0 advantage early in the se-

cond quarter. Kane, who caught
a 27-yard touchdown pass in the
third quarter, made an acrobatic
reception, leaping over and in
front of a Nittany Lion defender
to pull down the pass in the end
zone.

McPherson scored on a 6-yard
run with 38 seconds left to extend
Syracuse's lead to 27-0 at the

Syracuse took a. 41-0 lead in
the third quarter on Kane's se-
cond TD reception and a 20-yard
scoring run by McPherson, which

' followed a mishandled punt by

Penn State.

Brown gave Penn State its first
points of the game with an
80-yard touchdown scamper late
in the third quarter.
