Residence Life Position Unfilled,
New Director Appointed By Fall

As September and the beginning
of the Fall Term nears, Pitt’s Office
of Residence Life is still without a
director because of the June
resignation of former Director Fred
Fon.seca. Assistant Director
Joanne (Gibbs) Woodson is cur-
rently serving as acting director.

Fonseca’s resignation was un-
expected and came at a bad time of
the year, according to Robert G.
Houston, executive assistant to the
Vice Chancellor for Student Af-
“fairs.

Unlike the process used , for
appointing the " new director of
‘student activities when a ,search
committee was formed to screen
and interview applicants for the
position, the Office of Student
Affairs are simply screening
applications internally, Houston
said.

“There will be no search
committee,” Houston said. “Time
is working against us.”

The Ofﬁce of Student Affairs
immediately began advertising the
opening in mid-June, receiving
applications from 45 to 50
individuals, he said.

Student Affairs will screen the
applicants, interview those surviv-
ing the initial screening and choose
a new director, Houston said.

Students will be involved in the

interviewing process, he added.

“We hope to have an appoint-
ment made by September 1,”
Houston said.

The director of the Office of
Residence Life is “responsible for
the selection, training, supervision,
and evaluation of all professional
and student resident assistant staff
and the quality of life for a

residence hall population of 4,100
students,” according to an adver-
tisement for the position in the
Chronicle of Higher Education.

Pitt Funded For Diabetes Study

By The Associated Press.

A federal grant may speed the
day when diabetics can put aside
the hypodermic needles they use
strap on an
electronic box for the life-giving
insulin their bodies lack.

The $1.1 million grant is
supporting research at the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh on a soap
bar-sized device that would deliver
insulin doses automatically through
a tiny needle imbedded under the
skin.

“The money is very gratifying to
us, but it’s only one further piece in
the puzzle,” said Dr. James Gutai,
leading the two-year-old research

. project" along with Richard K.
Olson, director of health research
at Pitt.‘

Grants also were awarded by the
National Institute of Health for
similar research at the Mayo Clinic
and the University of Minnesota.

Gutai said the Pitt project is
aimed primarily at young diabetics.

““We’re looking at child diabetics
simply because they are the ones
who have the most to gain,” he
said. A

“We know the complications are
based in part on the length of time
one has the disease. We have
children here who have diabetes at
ages 1 and 2. So there is the
prospect of reducing the complica-
tions,” Gutai said in a recent
interview.

As estimated two million Ameri-
cans use insulin to treat diabetes,
which is the leading cause of
blindness in the country and also
causes cardiovascular and kidney
damage, said Gutai, 35. an
endocrinologist.

Compared with the pancreas, a
large‘ abdominal gland that
releases insulin as needed in

normal persons to convert digested ‘

food into blood sugar for body
energy, the three-ounce device is
simple.

New Activities Director
Assumes Job Monday

By JEFF COUCH
A Pitt News Staff Writer

Pitt’s new Director of Student
acitivites Andy Smith, who has
been meeting over the past several
weeks with students and staff, will
begin his new duties next Monday,
August 13.

Smith, currently director of
student activities at Community
College of Allegheny County,
Allegheny Campus, was appointed
director by Vice Chancellor for
Student Affairs Conney Kimbo
after a three month nationwide
search and interviewing process.

Members of the student
activities staff and students

volved in the search gave Smith
“higher marks” than any other
applicants, according to Kimbo.

In an interview last month, Smith
said Pitt has an unlimited potential
and students are ‘anxious to seeithe

V student activities program grow-

«» tAft'er several weeks of talkingiwiih“ 

 

students, Smith still feels the
same.

“The last several weeks have
reinforced my feelings that the
students are interested in aving a
worthwhile student activities
program here,” he said yesterday.

“My initial impressions of Pitt
have not changed,” he added.

Smith is trying to learn about the
system at Pitt in order to facilitate
any future decisions involving
changes in the student activities
program, he said.

“I’m trying to get an overview
of what the system is here, what’s
going on, and what has gone on in
the past,” according to Smith.

Student interaction and
involvement with his staff is a high
priority, much like his policy at the
community college, where he.
worked closely with the large
commuter population.

“I have no intention whatsoever

r

to hide behind a large, well-trained ,

about anywhere, in_ any contour of .

the body,” Gutai said. “It can be
ﬁxed to the body near the waist or
strapped on the belt.”

Inside, a week’s supply of liquid
insulin in contained in a plastic bag
surrounded by a jacket of salt
water. A battery-powered micro-
computer periodically electriﬁes
the salt water to free gases that
expand the jacket, squeezing
insulin from the plastic bag.

“The system...does not have
moving parts wich can be subjected
to wear,” Gutai said.

The box is a long way from
duplicating a pancreas, he said. It
can release only pre-determined
amounts. of insulin on a ﬁxed
schedule. Thus, the unit cannot
respond to a hard-working body’s
need for more blood sugar.

More sophisticated units exist,
but they are massive compared to
the Pitt prototype and require a
trained operator, Gutai said. The
large units are widely used in
hospitals.

 

 

    

Campus Newsbriefs

About 66 local high school students are enrolled ~._. ..
two-credit computer course in Pitt’s School of Engineering.
The students qualified for the course by competing in the
1979 seven-county Math Competition.

“....this course provides both college credits and the
opportunity for the high school student to. explore, first
hand, the university environment and the demands of a
technical profession,” according to Pitts Department of
Newsand Publications. .

Unlike other universities offering similar courses, the
Pitt program (College Transition Program) allows credits
earned to be transferred to other institutions if the student
chooses not to attend Pitt.

“All of these programs have been developed in order to
create the necessary intellectual and technical stimulation
for high quality engineering students,” according to the
release.

Pitt basketball star Sam Clancy, of Pittsburgh, was
recently honored by the Allegheny County Commissioners
for his participation on the U.S. basketball team in the
Pan-American Games in Puerto Rico.

Clancy, a junior, received a Certificate of Achievement
from Commissioners Jim Flaherty, Thomas J. Foerster and
Robert N. Peirce at a special ceremony downtown last
month.

Most college students working part-time or full-time
during the summer may not be aware that they do not have
to pay federal income taxes, according to the Pittsburgh
ofﬁce of the Internal Revenue Service.

According to Thomas L. Davis, IRS District Director for
Western Pennsylvania, “Most students earn less than
$3,300 a year andvdo not have to ﬁle a tax return. But if
income tax was withheld, they have to ﬁle a federal tax
return each year to get their money back.”

Any student who expects to earn less than the maximum
income level for 1979 should ﬁle a Form W-4, the
Employee’s Withholding Allowance Certiﬁcate, with their
employer, according to the IRS.

“As an advocate of ending the draft, I see reinstatement
of registration as a big step towards reinstating the draft

Union?

What Union?  

The Pitt Office of Admissions and Student Aid has
been relocated to Bruce Hall, leaving the sixth floor
of the Student Union vacant. The relocation presents
some interesting questions pertaining to the floors
next occupants.

Who will be awarded the space on the sixth floor
and on what grounds will that decision be made?

First, let us take a look at the physical makeup of
Schenley Mall and examine its current occupants.

Most student groups are located on the third and
fourth floors of the union with each group growling
about the lack of space allocated to it. The ground
floor basically consists of recreation and large

Column

group/meeting facilities. The remainder of the
floors, with the exception of the sixth, consist of ad-
ministrative and academic offices.

To an outsider, Schenley Hall looks about as much
like a student union as the Cathedral of Learning.
How can a student union, a place supposedly
designed to house student groups, a place developed
for students to congregate in a leisurely atmosphere,
a place to present student programs, house such non
student activity oriented offices like Math,
Philosophy or the Placement Center?

There are over 100 student organizations at Pitt
with some in need of additional space and many in
need of just a little space to base their operations.
Yet, our union continues to house academic depart-
ments and administrative offices.

Those organizations that have office space must‘
work in slum-like conditions, with paint chipped
ceilings, cracks in the walls, and stifling hot tempera-
tures.

But, upon entering an office occupied by Pitt
bureaucrats or academians, one steps into another
world. In most of those offices, there are carpets on
the floors, air conditioners in the windows, fresh
paint on the walls, and ceilings that are still in one
piece.

It is fairly obvious where the University senior
staff’s priorities lie; it is certainly not with the stu-
dents. Once our tuition fees are in the coffers of the
university, we are quickly forgotten.

Students are being slowly isolated from the ad-
ministration because of less access to the chancellor,
little input in major decision making, and growing
indifference by the university to the plight of student
organizations.

Student organizations are badly in need of extra
working space. They need the sixth ﬂoor of the
union in order to expand, enhance and compliment
their operations.

With the student union rennovation project far
from being realized, the university must accomodate
students by utilizing all available space in Schenley
Hall for students and students alone.

Chip ‘Off Pitt’s Old Block’ Hubbard and KDKA

By JEFF COUCH

Without a school of A broadcast journalism, one
would think that Pitt students have little or no chance

i to land a job in the competitive market of

professional radio, especially in a market the size of
Pittsburgh. That is not the case however, and 1978
graduate Tyrone “Chip” Hubbard is a perfect
example.

Hubbard is a producer for KDKA-AM, working
behind the scenes with local celebrities like Roy Fox,
Joe Gearing, and Perry Marshall. His respon-
sibilities include screening phone calls, booking
guests and generally programming radio talk shows
to satisfy the needs of KDKA’s large listening
audience.

“In essence you (a producer) are responsible for
making those people on the air a big hit for the
audience,” according to Hubbard.

Hubbard is quick to admit that the “talent,” as
radio personalities are called in the industry, provides
the charm, charisma, and wit so important in main-
taining the listenership. 1;;

“But what a lot of ,peI,6pl‘e out there don’t know is
that their are a lot of people behind those per-
sonalities,” Hubbard added.

What is interesting about former Pitt students like
Hubbard, is that they are becoming involved in a
field which they received no educational training
while at the university. People like Hubbard, Gail
German of WTAE—TV, Bob Mayo of
WWSW-AM, Tab Douglas of WYDD——FM, and
others majored in speech, political science, English
writing, and economics and other fields having little
to do with broadcasting. .

For Hubbard and the others, WPGH Radio (Pitt’s
current carrier station) provided the practical ex-
perience, incentive, and know-how needed to work
professionally.

“If I hadn't worked at WPGH, I probably
wouldn’t have the job at KDKA; I doubt if I would
have made broadcasting a career,” Hubbard said.

“There’s a lot to say about the station and the
school since Pitt has no broadcast communications
department,” he added.

Serving as a jack-of-all trades while at WPGH,
Hubbard said he owes the station a great deal.
To show his gratitutde to the organization, Hubbard
continues to train new station members on the fine
points of working in the broadcast studios.

What positions did he hold while working at
WPGH?

“The question should be what wasn’t I (at the
station),” he said. Hubbard worked as a newscast-

‘ er, sportscaster, disc jockey, executive board mem-

ber, sports director (for four years) and co-news
director with Bob Mayo (WWSW).

Don’t expect Hubbard to remain behind the scenes
for long. He hopes to work eventually as a sports-
caster and continue hs education in New York or
California studying broadcast management.

What has Hubbard learned by becoming involved
in a field like radio?

“We (producers) don’t get much money, but the
experience more than compensates for any monetary
problems,” he said. “It’s fun.”

You would think that a guy like Hubbard would
not have a problem in the world. But he does have
one which he calls an “identity crisis. ”

Hubbard bears such an amazing resemblance to
KDKA—TV newsman Bill Proctor that he is some-
times mistaken for him.

“I remember going to the ballpark to see the

Pirates play the Mets” Hubbard said.
“I was sitting in the press box with Roy (Fox),
Mary (a friend) and Tom Kukucka of The Pitt News.
“We got up during the seventh inning stretch when
all of a sudden people began‘ waving to me and
yelling ‘there’s Bill Proctor, ‘there’s Bill Proctor.”

What did Hubbard do? He waved back, enjoying
his moments of mistaken stardom.
“I run into that problem all the time,” he laughed.

“One of these days they are going to find out that
Pm me,” Hubbard said.

If Hubbard maintains his enthusiasm, ambition
and sheer talent, Pittsburgh radio lovers can expect
to be hearing more about him in the not too distant
future and everyone will know who Chip Hubbard
really is. Perhps Pittsburghers will begin mistaking
Proctor for'Hubbard. ._ --

Letter

Reorganization Unfair to Students.”  

Your editorial of Wednesday,
August 1' was an interesting one
indeed. Not only do I agree with your
observations concerning the univer-
sities administrative reorganization
(shades of J immy.Carter’s shakeup?),
but further observations can be made.

Why must such a change occur over
the summer rather than during the
regular school year? It seems like
every major policy decision directly or
indirectly affecting students occurs
over the summer months, when the
vast majority of students are home for
summer vacation. Not only is this a
cowardly act, it is unfair to the
students who may never really hear
about these changes.

The reorganization seems to indi-
cate who is favored by the Chancellor
and who is unimportant. If true, why
punish Dr. Kimbo when he has‘ not
had a chance to come to grips with his
new job? Also,- Dr. Kimbo could not
possibly have had the time to get to
know the chancellor considering his
relatively short tenure as a vice-
chancellor.

The university senior staff, as you
refer to it, was bad enough with its old
organizational setup. Now, the
Chancellor is even more isolated from
the decision-making process.

You know, I have seen the
Chancellor four times in my two years

at Pitt. Every time‘; it£was'at a social
function -requiring his ‘appearance.
Can a man running a major university
such as ours, with such little
interaction with students, really know
what's going on around campus? How
does he know‘ what the studentsffeel
about an issue-through osmosis?

I hope this reorganization is fully
detailed, with a summation of its
implications, in the Fall issues of the
Pitt News when the remaining student
body returns. They must realize that
the wool has been pulled over their
eyes.
