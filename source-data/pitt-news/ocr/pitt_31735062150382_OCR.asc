Miss Amos was appointed dean
of women by the late Chancellor
Samuel Black 3/lcComiicl»:. In her
22-year tenure at the University,
she became known to the _thousands
dot men and women who worked
and studied at the University.

Upon learning of the death of
Miss Amos, Chancellor John G.
Bowman and Dr.'Vincent W.'Lan-
fear, dean of men, expressed "their

. sentiments in the following state-

ments: , , 
“Tliyrsa. Amos met the end of’
her life as she had always ‘lived.
She did not give up. 1n-_a_nypmb-
lem Miss Amos always, ﬁrstsought
for facts. Then with kindness,
imagination, and common‘ sense
she found what ,to_gdo. , She. _wa.s
one of_ those exceptionally rare,
women to whom thel'word regal"
applied. Her inﬂuence 'updn"lives"
is beyond «all
measuring.”—John G. Bowman.
"The death of Dean Thyrsa W.
Amos means a. great loss :to the
University, especially in the ﬁeld
of student activities. Her ideals
have been a ﬁne inﬂuence in the
rtudent life of the University for
over 20 years. The women's ac-
tivities at the University under
her direction have become well
known for their excellence far be-
yond the Pittsburgh" area.’ Her
leadership and influence are in
evidence in the majority of activi-
ties on the campus, and the loss
of this leadership will be keenly
felt by faculty members ‘and stu-
dents alike.”—Vincent W._ I.-anfear.

Students expressed deep regret at
the death of Miss Amos.

“The women of the University
have lost a great friend and ad-
viser in Dean Amos. She was kind-
ly, sympathetic, and had a keen
knowledge of the problems of the
students—both men and women—
at the University. The ‘students
and laculty alike mourn her pass-

On Senior Dlemorials:
“A Dlodern Instance”

A SCATHING COMMENTARY on world
conditions as they are and may soon be is one
proposal for a senior memorial.

At Pitt the senior class presents some orna-
ment to the University as a memorial of its
graduation. Last year the memorial was two
stained glass windows depicting springtime.
This year another stained glass set has been
ordered.

But at Colgate university a fellow named
Blackmore—Bob Blackmore, Phi Beta Kappa,
got up at the senior class beer party and made
a proposal——“too tragic for laughter, too sym-
bolic to be overlooked, too clever to be ignored."

Bob Blackmore is to be drafted in July, after
his graduation in June. He got to his feet,
pushed his beer mug back and proposed that the
senior class gift be a sum of money to erect at
a suitable occasion a ﬁtting memorial to the first
member of the "senior class killed in the war.
World War II. That’s ours.

It was quiet for a moment. ‘Bob Blackmore
grinned and sat down, gripping his beer mug.
He meant. it as_ a joke. The rest of the class
didn’t think so. V For, as columnist Jim Cleveland

wrote in the Colgate ’.vIaroon, added sugges-

tions. began pouring in,

Someone suggested that the memorial be to
the ﬁrst conscientious objector thrown in jail.
Others said it should be to all members of the
class killed. Some wanted to restrict the memo-
rial to the ﬁrst member of the class to be killed
in action, or to the ﬁrst killed in this hemisphere.
One or two thought the money. ought to be put
in_to a fund and named for the ﬁrst casualty.

Maybe it was a joke. But as a joke it was
a pretty good one.

For in that one proposal to erect at a suitable
occasion a ﬁtting memorial to the first member
of the senior class killed in the war, there is a
world of feeling. That world of feeling repre-
sents the feeling of the students of the world.
It acc_epts the situation as it is. There is no back-
ingvout-.-» There» is only a deep feeling of resig-
nation, becdfase there are no leaders and no one
talks stra.igh.t. "

Locked‘ doors are a common occurrence around the
Commonsroom. during free hours. Just for fun, we’ve
left ours unlocked. Stray couples will drift in, bounce
out as they realize someone is there. Solitary engineers
bring their lunches. Tuckshoppers have their matches
ready for the smoke. Everyone tries to be unobtrusive
in leaving.

It's safer with the doors unlocked. Bill Daufenbach

Dressing room doors have always bothered Pitt
Players and Cap and Gown. Foster memorial, where
Players produce, has interconnecting men’s and women’s
dressing rooms. Bob Grape carries keys.

Cap and Gown uses the Nixon, where light from the
dressing rooms always spills onto the stage and ruins
the effect of the settings. This year C&G had no
trouble: the dressing room lights were out, doors were
closed. The Pittsburgh Art school had a life class
across the way, and the boys thought it better if no
lights were showing on the Nixon side of Montour way.

0110- Why Bias

The Army Makes Men——

Mad, Column.ist (.3-ripcs

. . By oscan snnrnnn

Chairman of Spring.

We are against-the army. We are against the whole -

regimental set-up;
personal scapegoat.

The military life has become our
Andall because of one person;

. A We got a letter from a friend the other day. He

is one of those of whom the army is making “a man.”

All we can ‘say is that “to make a rnan of hirnmis to a

lower him‘ some five or six degrees.‘ Before he left ‘for

camp he was .inﬁ.nitely mo1T_e.f,than what we designate"
bythe term, “-a man.” He was clean, inside and_out,_

clean of mind and heart and body.
The.Letter* . _‘ A 4.
In his letter "he says‘:_, .  .- ~
“I can’t' laugh . . . Th-ere’s a new

given 1', '. . at-‘power any moron can lea?-n_‘.in avday.
And maybe‘ two" in a'million can build one.”  ,

For what they are trying to do to that one person
we condemn the entire army and its oiﬁcers andthe
bars and stripes behind it an.d The Whistle. Sure we
need an army. And when the trouble begins, those of
us who aren’t in the thick of it will be crying for the
boys in khaki to come to our rescue. We're the ones
who do the whining and complaining until something
happens. Then we scream for help.

Unilateral Inutility _

But why the unilateral inutility of the whole setup?
Why suppose that discipline is the universal answer to
the problem of four million separate temperaments?
They take our friend. He can laugh and make others
laugh, He is clean, and in his presence others are
washed. Then they take him; they put him in a group
with a coal-miner who lives by rule of the fist, a de-
pression-infant who moves only when certain buttons
in his back are pushed, and perhaps a farm-hand Whose
bodily and emotional and intellectual movements are
gross and convulsive, incapable of the minute discrim-
inations that make for richer living. They take these
four and they say, We will make men of these. The
11105‘ amazing thing is that they are all different and
we will accomplish our ends by the same method. All
of them will be hardened by The Whistle. They will
bow before it, and worship it, and march in whatever
direction it bids them march.

They are wrong. The basic corruption of their sys-
tem is its inefﬁciency. One might as well take all the
people of the world and try to make bakers of them,
perhaps only because someone has decreed that bread
is non-fattening.

The Army System

Some day we will come to realize that the army
system has two aspects. First, it is indispensable in
time of crisis; it is perhaps the most important level
in the social scheme. Second, it is absolutely useless in
time of peace; it contributes nothing constructive. It
produces nothing, tangible or intangible. It does not
even make men of its soldiers.

Later in the letter. he says:

“It’s a big item,—-mighty big. And now I know
that I’m bigger. I still want to create. I will create.
I‘m biq—bigger than death, and only smaller in life.”

He is big-and he is clean, and once he could laugh.

When Chancellor B<:==:r«'i::n so-')l<(=.
during a stutlen‘. assembly two
months ago. he told oi’ plans for a
$1,250,000 student union buildiiig‘,
plans drawn nearly 10 years ago.

Some. students closed their eyes
and pictured along‘ the Fifth ave-

nue side of the Frici: acre.-;, a build-
ing; as magniﬁcert as the‘ Cathe-
dal. But when they opened‘ their
eyes and saw nothing between them-
.sel\'cs and Fifth avenue, they sighed.
And when they th'ou,-ght‘ oi‘ class-

Astudent union ‘\§.'Ll.~a' :1 thing of
the future. tl:e’t;-.'r'fu.nn'e, l:k'~ an
H. G. Vt-"ells fantasy, they thought.

But they did not lcnow that today
"Pitt has mary union‘ activities and
the raw materials, for many more.
In fact, a few students have won-
dered if Pitt really needs a union,
at least for the present.

the director of Huston ‘nail, U:~.iver-
sity of Pennsylmmia. Pitt has all
but 13 of these union iunctioi‘:s. and
i'acili?:ies missing
t‘.-som the Pitt list. could be estab-
lished at the University. l‘~’Iz-my oi’
the remaining items on the list are
satisﬁed by bus.inesses within walk-
ing distance of the Cathedral.

The list includes alumni oﬁices.
art rooms, cafeteria. game rooms
(checkers. chess. z-and cards), con-
-.i'cren(‘e rooms, .ia-culty rooins, in or-
-mation bureau. library, locker and

Also required for a student union

leys. barber shop and beauty shop,

theater, writing room. tailor shop
and a swimming pool, not ircluded
in the Cathedral but many of which
~could always be eliminated from
-the list because oi’ local businesses
it.-onveniently located. '

Tl'1OSe who. believe that construct-
ing‘ a student union building at the
'Uni\Iersity, centering all these ac-
tivities, would be a foolish and im-
-practical endeavor, list two main
reasons for their objection:

1. Since 8.0 perxcent or ‘the Pitt‘

students co’mmut.e, a student union
building would be oi‘ no value, for
student life is, not centered about

the University ;{and’never could be. '

2. Rooms “hlready have been
-‘provided in tl1e_C'iathedi;al i'_or_ union
activities niuld other i~oon§.s could be
-ﬁnished to pl‘6Vl,dQ"1'h.3i3li$ more ad-
vantages of a union.

Advocators of a union argue that

a union building would attract stu- ._
dents to a more ;active lne at the;

University, and the Cathedral has =.

not enough ﬁnished classrooms, let ‘-

alone social rooms.

In a recent study of student union _
.-.,1dvantage\s, ,it wus'.~d.iscq\_/ered that 
University'""'studei1ts lack few of the

The ceremony here at Pitt is uni-
que among senior queen cor-ma-
tions in that it is patterned :i.f..‘t‘ei‘
the actual British crowning oi." their
rulers.

The ritual is semi-religioiis, and
the customs ol)s.e1'i.'erl can be traced
back to the eighth century,- Eng‘-
land. One of the features of the
program is the music supplied by a
vested choir. In place of the E213-
lish archbishop. the leadership of
the ceremony here is assumed by
Alma Mater, the _e,‘irl who places
second in the competition for Senior
Queen.

Anotlicr unusual aspect of the
cve‘nt is the manner in which each
other female member oi’ the senior
cl:-iss places a crown on her head at
the same moment the queen is hon-

’ ored.

The headdress of the queen 1::
more elaborate than that. worn by
the other {2,irls, but the pattern is
basically the same.

The Senior Queen is elected by
popular vote of the girls of the
_;{l'{lClll.-.'-l‘il.l]g i:.lass.
