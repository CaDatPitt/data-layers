t Ni "ht," to be held at the Car-

37

osday. evening, November 29. The
I casion is, of course, the .’_I‘wenty- v

closing dateis December 4). This
exhibition, long known throughout
art world as the -greatest exhi-
tion of its kind, and, in fact, the
ly annual international...»cross-sec-
on of’ contemporary painting in
cmerica, has been seen by more than
0,000 Pittsburghers already this
oason,-including many Pitt alumni.‘
‘Seeing the exhibit “on your own,”
waver, and seeingit under intelli-

 very different things.
Modern painting, as everyone
knows, is marked by certain extreme
eltddncies in the various schools and
agaries of Post- Impressionism,
ch to :_the. average layman are
eaningless, if not stupid. That
therein a “lunatic fringe” of quacks
 charlatans among the ‘modems
iynadmitted by all observers. I On the
ther hand, there are“ unquestionably.
ny modernists who are attacking
pillow. problems in a sincere and in-
.—-ﬂslligent way, and who have some-
thing to say that is wortha Ihearmg
mong-art lovers. The Carnegie Ex-
bitlon this year is probably more
adical in art tendencies than any
V%ot~ held here, and Director Homer
‘ gt». Gaudens justifies this on, the
ground that its aim is not to please
spopular notions of what art ought
* but to give a. truthful sum-
%mary of the dominant tendencies. of
11od&Y.in.the studios of, Europe and
America- The exhibit has about 400
aintings this year, and a valuable
hlnovation is that only 80 artists are
represented, so that groups of from
twolto‘ ﬁve paintings can be‘ shown"
roﬁ .:cach. This givessa much fair-
.  idea of each painter’s work than
could be obtained under the older

system. *

BRIDLE RAMPANT JOURNALISM

With one Mr. ‘William Randolph ..Hearstl_
deluging « the «newspaper-rea_d1n_g public with ‘
glaring Vermilion-colored headlines and _spec- '

tacular news accounts of the alleged disclosures

' in, Mexico, the college student, not to mention

the public in general, should’ use care» and in-
telligence in accepting , and] interpreting the
content of these articles.

’ Mr. Hearst and hisnewspapers, which incl-

dentally command a tremendous inﬂuence in.
modern journalism, can hardly be called con-_

servative in their journalistic standards. In

other words, they will subordinate much to the ‘
opportunity of spreading the redink and ﬂood- :
ing the page. with'“last-minute” photos, letters _.
and other data. These extreme.tendencies-and‘ 
 impressive make-ups are especially appealing .

to the “radical element’? amongcollege students
who love such discoveries and gloat over such

tidal waves as Mr. Hearst has created. ,  . 
The authenticity of these ﬂagrant accounts’

of the monkey business supposed. to have
ensued between‘ Mexico, China,: Nicaragua and
perhaps a half-dozen countries, we do not at-
tempt to estimate. The value of the facts will

i be ascertained only in time.’

Whatever their strain, however, the data on
this international entanglement niust be read

‘ wisely and with plenty of salt where the salt

is obviously necessary.‘

' THE PRIVATE LIFE OF A FRESHMAN
‘/2 column. Sunday Papers 10 cents. 
Once again Pitt as it isn’t has crept into the
town papers.
regulations. _
_ A feature writer in one of the Sunday news-
papers boldly and assuredly told just how Pitt

and Carnegie Tech are making the frosh tread L
’ the straight and ‘narrow, how council meetings
. are held weekly to punish the erring, whata
glorious one-day respite the first-year menwill

have tomorrow, Thanksgiving, and how on the
-following day they will have to-return-to the

 inquisition.

All of this would be interesting if true, and
to a Sunday feature writer is interesting any-
way. To illustrate:

.“When a freshman" commits an infraction,
he is taken before the council, which meets
weekly. Witnesses testify against him-—always
adversely——the council brings in a guilty or,
not guilty verdict, seldom the latter, and the _V
prisoner is sentenced,’ all following the pro-
zedure of a regular court trial.

“Many and varied are the penalties. A
haircut, a paddling; parade the campus with
rolled up trousers and coats reversed, accost
co-eds with marriage proposals on bended
knees and traverse the walks of the campus

, bearing humorous signs and placards.

“These are the routine sentences. But in
some cases, where especially drasticpenalties
are deemed necessary, other and more embar-
rassing tasks are imposed. ' .

“Adjudge these: A boy clad only in a
running suit, trotting up and down Fifth

ﬁfteen feet of rag tail. Or a collegian stand-
ing in Fifth.avenue* and Wood street at the
- same time of day, passing out toothpicks to
passersby. Or a freshman with reversed coat,
hoisted trouser legs and a “dink” passing out
slips of paper bearing his name, telephone
number and requests for the recipients, always
girls, to “calI_hiin up.” _ i . ‘
We sympathize with thewriter of the above.
He missed the real feature- While he was

"racking his brain for ﬁction, a s_tranger-than-

The feature that he missed is that in the

mild regulations which are hardly evident after
And he missed

 

by Student Council last spring, that they were
renovated this fall, and that they are now rele-

 gated to the status of aﬁfteenth amendment.

AWe may be wrong in believing that these

 ifacts would be interestingto the readers of the

_.Sunday press, but we do feel j ustiﬁed -in calling

   

attention to how the» Pittsburgh ‘schools are

if  beingmisrepresented to the general public, and
_we feel that by pointing out where the real

feature might lie, we will do more for, prevent-
ing such stories in the future -than by making a

‘ This time it is about freshman. '

Recen tlyfProfefss‘or:» Alexander Sil-
verman, head of the chemistry de-
partment, delivered an ‘address’, at

the Chemistry Conference ‘held in“

connection with thededication of the

chemistry-psychology building at
Wittenberg college, on “The Future

in (Qiemical Education.” Although

the sentiment presented dealt di-

rectly with one particular ﬁeld, it is

so logical, conclusive and well-

defined, that gleanings can herein be

included with advantage -to. the stu-”
dent’s conception of education at it
should beserved up. ,

_ Discussing his theory of the futures
policy of education, he says,

‘_‘Now what does this all-
mean? It means that we shall
have to forego the pleasure or
givifig a great niimbei-‘of regu-

, larly scheduled lectures, and
telling the students what we
think. It means‘ that we shall

~ ‘ have to get away from the law

of averages and study theneeds’
of individuals.’ It means that
we shall discontinue - sending
students into the world on the
invisible crutches that we have
created for them. The signiﬁcant
feature of the plan is that it will
developj self-conﬁdence in. our. _
graduates, teach them how to
search for  truth, when . we
are no “longer there to guide
them, encourage the: ‘library’
habit.-' We all know that -in in-_
dustry one should-"first-see what
has been done, before proceeding.
with plans for‘ the future. And
this system“ of education will “ de-
velop a~ self-reliance” which will
cause industry to point to our
iinstitutions of» higher learning
with pride saying “Something
has really been’ accomplished.”
Industry can use slow men; av-_‘
erage men, rapid workers,’ but

   

not sixty or_,_seventy per
centers.” * , g
Here wghave a policy as healthy

as it is .ovel:- teach, the’ college

courage the student while he. is in
college to: build his own i'oiind_ation
in such a way that he will not. feel
lost without the surveillance"of his
pmiessora when he leaves school..-j

Professor Silverinan-, in conclud-'_

ing‘, atreised the practicability of his}

theory: ,
“My auditors are probably
thinking that I am dreaming of ‘
another Utopia. Nothing of the
-sort. The plan is, thoroughly
practical and will work. The in-
stitution that realizes its value
can take the lead in education"
vxithin a decade’. All of us who
reﬂect. must see our shortcom-
ings. Let us turn over tllﬂ-I1¢W_'_
' leaf and putinto practicethosev
' plans which we know will~lni-
prove the product of our institu-
tions of higher learning. Indula ‘
try will scrap millions of dollars
worth of equipment . when ‘a
newer and better process looms
up as more ‘proﬁtable. Why
should education not discard an
"V inetﬂcient plan’ for‘ one that is:
ibettei-1” - V
Could not Professor Silvcriiiaifs

plan be attempted with resulting lin-
proveineniq over the present system .-
of ‘making-—.the, graduate an eventual_,

‘parasite instead of an independent
thinker? We should like to soothe
experiment undertaken, especially
since" the college of today is not fol-
lowing its gospel in’ producing sol!-

reliant, dynamic individuals.

A -word, however, I.b0l1t..l‘.he people
who write, particularly "those people
who compose po-EMS. .
They are angther of life’s hope-
lessly insoluble enigmas. For on a
campus that abounds in jazz, cheer-
leaders, cynics, iconoclasts, and fra-
ternity boys, those odd specimens
who travel .alone_ and sing of blue
mists" and Nan must of necessity be
misunderstood and frowned upon as
being slightly ‘_‘oiT.” Yet they per-
sist. Of course, their heads. are in “
the clouds. Perhaps, though, they
see things that are hidden from the
majority of us. . c T
' Theyare doomed as well to a hard
and lonely path to recognition. One
need but consider the more barbaric
male who chooses the gridiron, to!"
"the scene of the gloriﬁcation of his
ego. He has only to prance by
various s k i 1 I f 111 maneuverings
through _a group of somewliat
threatening opponents, pause T dra-
matically under the goal posts, -and
the vociferous cheers of thousands
of admirers are all for hiing. Surely
for all who can stand the rough. ca- _

resses of 200-pound bullnecks, this is
the way to be different. ‘
It is not so with the young poet.

His -closest approach to an hour of
triumph comes when he either timid,-
ly or‘ bragadociously produces his
carefully folded lmanuscript,’ and
then only to at conﬁdential friend,
and prays for an understanding look
in response. Should, he chance to
be discovered by any of the colic-
giate". lcynicsr, however, he is liable
to suﬁer ignominieslcomparable to
tl1ose“'experienced by Dr. Faustus
when he was carried to by the
devils.. ' . -’
4‘ Those “poetic people” must remain
a mystery to us. Being of "a more
egotistical nature, they are’ 
often bored by the mundane mean-
derings of the mass of college stu-
dents; Theiwoiiders and joys of far
oil’ dream landsconcerii them.: So,
it is only when they havepainted
in words the things they have seen,
that we know them for ,a.. moment.

  FINAL 'l‘ILT

The Pitt Freshmen defeated the
West Virginia Cubs 13-2 at Morgan-
town -last Saturday]. in. their ﬁnal
game as a Panther yearling« team
‘and have now hung up their mole-2
skins.tb‘watcli the last football snow,
of the season‘ at the -stadium} ‘tomor-j
rowafternoon. This gamewas orig,-
inally’ scheduled to be played tomor-
row -but was moved up when the
Wash,-Jeff freshmen was cancelled.
.. The Blue and Gold yearling lino-
meiidisplayed their best form of the
year when the held the driving
Mountaineers: or four straight
downs on their own one-foot line.
Four’ West Virginia line thrusts
were stopped and Anderson, ;Pitt’s
puiiting ‘fullback, s'te'pp‘ed behind‘ his
own goal to kick. On the kick-Ray
stepped’ out of bounds, giving the
losers a safety ant‘, consequently
their own’ two points of the game.

Carlson’s“bo’ys'~open‘ed up the first-

 

tjuarter with a score’ when fleebty
John Jones-‘intercepted a West ‘Vir-

ginia pass in midﬁeld andadvanced
to the Mountaineers 28-yard line be-
fore he. was stopped. After three
line thrusts’, Bill Walinchus smashed
through ‘right tackle ifoi the first
touchdown. The try ‘forpomt was

a Mountaineer’ fumble on his own
12-yard {inc and ‘diashed 88 yards for
the other home score of the game.

Coach -Carlson ‘constantly shiited
his lineup during-the encounter in
attempting to get his best working
eleven on. the ﬁeld, making ten sub-
stitutions in the sixty minutes of
play. Franklin Hood, who was hurt
in the Penn State. game, did not get
into the’ tray and his fullback job
was ably taken over by Ray Ander-
son: Anderson and Walinchus played
their best game-of the season,’ both
ripping ‘through the opposing line

made by Dr. E. B. Roberts’ of the
educational department of the West-
inghouse Electric and Manufactur-
ing company, in_ addressing the
“fourteenth ‘annual ‘meeting of the
‘association of urban universities in

Dr. Roberts discussed the desire
of . the employees of the institution

‘ he ‘represents for further education.

‘He’ commended especially the work
of - the University of Pittsburgh in
offering courses in; ..advance_d’ studies
taught by university professors
which are conducted j within the
walls of the factory itself. .

~_-It -was brought» out in the meet-
ing‘ that adopting a. common goal
