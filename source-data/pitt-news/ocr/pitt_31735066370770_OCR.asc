Pitt accepts center
from Gulf Oil Corp.

By David Zafris
Staff Writer

Pitt’s board of trustees voted
Wednesday to accept Gulf Oil Cor-
poration's donation of the Gulf
Research and Development Center
in Harmarville to the University.
The trustees approved the terms of
an agreement giving Pitt the 54-
building, 85-acre site.

Under terms specified in the
agreement, the facility will be
renamed Pittsburgh University
Research Center (PU RC) when the
University takes over in March
1986.

Qne provision enables Pitt to

begin leasing unused space at the-

facility prior to the March takeover.
“We have a number of potential
tenants eager to move in and take
advantage of the excellent facilities
at Harmarville," said Jack Freeman,
Pitt's executive vice-president. “This
provision will allow us to accomo-
date them quickly, so they will not

have to look elsewhere to meet their-

immediate needs.”

The center will also provide incu-
bator services for small companies,
transfer technology between univer-
sity laboratories and regional corpo-
rations, and contract research

Pitt, Links create scholarships for disadvantaged

By Nancy Quick
Assistant News Editor

A national community service
organization’s Pittsburgh chapter
has joined with the University of
Pittsburgh in sponsoring full -four-
year scholarships for two Pitt
freshmen.

The local chapter of the Links, an
organization comprised of promi-
nent black women throughout the
United States, raised $5,000 for the
proposed program. After Pitt
agreed to contribute twice that
amount to the fund, two full scholar-
ships were created.

funded by government or private
sources.

Trustees heard another presen-
tation that was given by the head of
Pitt’s Center for International Stu-
dies, concerning the proposed estab-
lishment of new programs in Central

Amercian, Chinese and Indian
studies.
Dr. Burkart Holzner travelled

with Pitt president Wesley Posvar to
several countries speaking with pol-
itical leaders and‘ businessmen. “We
are learning that by cooperating
region to region, lessons can be
derived and information forming
policies can be developed that could
not otherwise through governmen-
tal activity," Posvar said.

The Indian project came about
because a group of Indian-born
American scientists proposed rais-
ing an endowment of one million
dollars in support of an Indian stu-
dies program at Pitt, according to
Holzner. ‘

The trustees also passed a resolu-

-tion appointing university directors.

and alternate directors to the Board
of Bituminous Coal Research
National Laboratory. W.H. Krome
George was reappointed director,
with John Marous continuing as his
alternate.

Posvar had affirmed their interest in
a renewed effort with regard to dis-
advantaged students,” said Dr. Jack‘
Daniel, assistant to the provost.
“The Links approached us because
of our commitment to university-
community partnership."

Dr. Elizabeth Younge, chairman
of the Links’ Arts committee, agreed
with Daniel, saying, “The focus of
our organization is to better the
quality of life for black youth and
the aged.

“In this particular facet of our
program, we aim to help students of
the fine arts by offering them schol-
arships,” Younge said. “We chose
Pitt because it provided us with such
a strong partnership in education.”

Upon the recommendation of
Pitt's Senate Athletic Committee,
the quality point average require-
ment for senior athletes has been
raised to 2.0.

According to Pitt's athletic direc-
tor, Dr. Edward Bozik, there are
varying QPA and credit load stan-
dards for each year. Only the senior
year has been affected by the higher
QPA standard, originally set at 1.9.
The QPA requirements for fresh-
men, sophomores and juniors which
are respectively 1.8, 1.8 and 1.9,
remain unchanged. ‘

Bozik said he agrees totallywith

a student of the music school, will be
honored at a reception Sunday in
the Frick Fine Arts Building. Three
students from Carnegie-Mellon
University will also be recognized.

CMU was unable to support ‘the-

Links scholarship fund to the finan-

- cial extent that Pitt did. However,

partial scholarships totaling $350
each were given to these three
students.

“This money will help pay for
books and supplies, for leotards or
dance shoes,” Younge said. “It’s not
a lot, but it helps.”

To be eligible for the Pitt scholar-
ships, each student was required to
have an outstanding high school
academic record, to possess an aca-
demic interest in the creative or per-
forming arts, and to show

recommendation to raise the QPA
standard, claiming it was a “reason-
able conclusion on their part.”

Bozik explained, “Both the
NCAA and the university require
that the athletes must be making
satisfactory progress towards their
degrees.” Claiming that the 2.0
standard is “no big deal,” Bozik said,
“It’s not unreasonable that an ath-
lete that close to graduation should
not have a 2.0."

Panther head football coach F oge
Fazio said the 2.0 standard is “a
good rule” for the athletes. He said it
is a way to check that “they’re on
track.” Commenting on the athletes,
Fazio said, “They’ve worked hard
and we're sending them on their

. way. 

educational, social or economic dis-
advantage. To keep the scholarship,
both students must maintain a 2.75
QPA.

Dr. Younge explained that the
Arts Committee is only one of the
projects sponsored by the Links.
“We like to call our four-prong pro-
gram the umbrella approach,”
Younge said. “As well as the youth
fine arts program, we sponsor one
for the aged, one on national trends
for women and one on international
trends for women. We support the
NAACP, the Urban League and the
United Negro College Fund. We do
things on an elaborate scale.”

Last October, the Links spon-
sored a black celebrity auction to
raise the money for this year's
scholarships.

“I think every one of our seniors
has a 2.0 or better.” He added that
the seniors have at least 80 credits
and some have more.

Steve Apke, a junior football
player, expressed an opinion similar
to Bozik’s. He said the 2.0 standard
really doesn’t make that much dif-
ference. “Only borderline instances
might make a difference,” Apke‘
added. '

Apke also said he thinks most ath-
letes are already serious about aca-

demics and that many turn to the-

Athletic Support Services for
needed help. The Athletic Support
Services, located at 214 William Pitt
Union, provides assistance to ath-

letes having difficulty with courses;

“We wrote to Lena Horne,‘ Harry

Younge. “The money we raised at

man was out of town and unavaila-
ble for comment. However, senior
basketball player Joey David said
the higher standard might make ath-
letes take their academics more
seriously.

“Athletes are capable, but with
the lower standard, they won't work
up to their abilities,” he said. David
also said that his teammates were
aware of the rise in the QPA require-

ment. He predicted that the use.of -

the Athletic Support services‘ might
increase.

Athletic Support Services direc-
tor Paul Yuna predicted otherwise.
“I don’t anticipate any significant
change in the use of the service," he

said. ‘‘I don’t think the demand will
change because most athletes need a,‘

2.0 anyway."

WASHINGTON (UPI) — The
White House reacted coolly to the
Rev. Benjamin Weir's call for the
U.S. government to make imme-
diate “new efforts” to free the six
Americans still held by terrorists in
Lebanon. Weir was freed Saturday
by his Shiite Moslem kidnappers
after 16 months in captivity.

He warned that the Moslem
extremists may kidnap more Ameri-
cans or kill the six remaining Ameri-
can hostages if their demand is not
met. The kidnappers want the
release of 17 terrorists imprisoned in
Kuwait.

White House spokesman Edward
Djerejian said President Reagan lis-
tened intently to Weir's news confer-
ence yesterday. But Djerejian
reaffirmed the administration’s pol-
icy of refusing to give in to terrorists.
He pledged a continued emphasis on
“quiet diplomacy” to secure the hos-
tages’ release.

A Presbyterian minister, Weir
said his captors released him as a
sign of their good intentions, but he
also said they are not willing to wait
much longer.

Weir conﬁrmed that four of the 1

six hostages are alive and well. He
said be last saw them on Saturday.

He identified them as Terry Ander-
son, the Rev. Lawrence Jenco,
David Jacobsen and Thomas
Sutherland.

But he added that he had no infor-
mation on two other Americans,
U.S. diplomat William Buckley and
ailing librarian Peter Kilburn.

Trial concludes

PITTSBURGH (UPI) — The
defense attorney in a federal drug
trial said the government used
“unbelievable” testimony from
wealthy ballplayers to make his
client the scapegoat in baseball's
cocaine scandal.

Adam Renfroe said the govern-
ment has no direct evidence against
his client, Curtis Strong, who is
charged with I4 counts of selling
cocaine to major-league players.

Instead, Renfroe claimed the
prosecution used .cocaine-snorting

ballplayers to make Strong “respon- -

sible in everybody’s mind for trying
to destroy the spinal cord of Ameri-
can baseball." Renfroe said the
blame lies with the players, manag-

ers and owners, who have all the
money.

In his final arguments, Renfroe
singled out Dave Parker of the Cin-
cinnati Reds as a man whose testim-
ony should not be believed.
Renfroe‘s summation followed that
of prosecutor J. Alan Johnson, who
described Strong as a “traveling
salesman” who sold cocaine to the
players.

Johnson said Strong’s clientele
was the best a drug dealer could
have—namely, young men with
money, on the road, with time on
their hands. But Johnson also said
the players who testified about their
cocaine purchases and use were
hardly “pillars of the community.”

While Strong's case was drawing
to a close, Dale Berra of the New
York Yankees testified in another
cocaine trial in the same Pittsburgh
courthouse. Berra is one of the play-
ers who testified for the prosecution
in Strong’s trial. The former Pirate
said he bought cocaine from Robert
“Ray" McCue on three occasions.
McCue also is charged with selling
drugs to ballplayers.

United Way campaign launched

By Ingrid Smith
Staff Writer

An estimated 200 volunteers
gathered yesterday in the William
Pitt Union to officially lauch Pitt's
1985 United Way campaign.

“The United Way drive is a con-
tinuing effort of the community to
help the homeless, hopeless and less
fortunate people,” said Dr. John
Quatroche, yesterday at the cam-
paign kick—off meeting.

Quatroche, the 1985 campaign
chairman, announced that the
theme of this year’s drive is “Pitt
Care.”

“This year Pitt can demonstrate
our generosity to the community.“

According to President Wesley
Posvar, who spoke at the meeting,
there is a paradox in Pittsburgh.
Despite depression and unemploy-
ment, some institutions continue to
grow in prosperity, with the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh being one of the_
leaders. “We should pledge our-
selves to actions,” said Posvar, “not
words.” Posvar said he would like to
see Pitt strive to exceed the goal of
$150 thousand dollars.

renowned transplant surgeon,
endorsed Posvar and noted that the
University of Pittsburgh is the city’s
largest employer. “It is important to
share our prosperity with the com-
munity,” said Starzl.

The United Way Campaign is one
of the largest and most productive
charities. There are approximately
65 thousand unemployed residents
in Pittsburgh, and most of them
have never been unemployed in their
adult lives. “These are just a small
portion of people who United Way
will help,” claimed David Epperson,
dean of the School of Social Work.

Guest speaker, Foge Fazio, led
the drive with determination. “We
have a positive attitude and a stong
committment of helping the com-
munity. They help us, and we are

willing to help.”

“I hope we believe in ‘Pitt Cares’.
The university is visible to the public
not only in athletics but in medicine
and education, they watch every step
we take," continued Fazio. “When
athletes are challenged, they stand
up and face the challenge. Now, we
should stand up and face this chal-
lenge." Enthusiastically he added,
“Let's all be winners — let‘s all give
ll0 per cent.”

Quatroche said he is confident
that the university will meet its 1985
campaign goal. “We know that Pitt
people care. We encourage members
of the university family to view their
contributions as an investment to
assure that help will always be there
when it is needed by them or their
friends and neighbors.”

‘Star Wars’  

Administration officials have reported that President
Reagan will continue to push for support of his space-
based, antimissile defense program. Furthermore, they
report that he refuses to allow the. program to become a

i ' point of negotiation in U.S.-Soviet arms talks. This leads

us to ask, “Is this kind of inﬂexible attitude conducive to
real progress in containing the arms race?”

It’s highly unlikely that this unyielding stance will
affect any significant arms control agreement. What is
more likely to occur is that the Soviets will respond not
only by resisting any efforts to limit the development of
its offensive weapons, but also by launching a “Star
Wars” program of its own’(note: the Reagan administra-
tion contends that such a program is already underway in
the Soviet Union). Thus, as we see it, should President
Reagan adhere to this stance, then the success of arms
control negotiations with the Soviet Union is dubious.

Many critics claim that Reagan’s attitude on this mat-
ter will serve to exacerbate the arms race. Do we honestly
want an already enormous defense budget imposing a
further drain on America’s resources? More seriously, do
we wish to tolerate the threat to world peace and the
conditions of instability and tension that are created by
an unrestrained arms race?

Often, it seems that the Reagan administration merely

pays lip service to the improvement of ‘relations with the
Soviet Union. Yes, the U.S. should regard an adversary
possessing such imposing strength as the Soviet Union
with suspicion and exercise due caution when engaging
its officials in negotiations. But, to entirely dismiss the
possibility of achieving meaningful agreements with the

Soviet Union is not only misguided, but dangerous as
well.

Bad PR

1 recently read an article by Mat-
thew Tolbert on “Simply Speaking.”
It bemoaned some of the teaching
troubles at Pitt and criticized the
lack of clear expression by some
brilliant professors.

I wish to point out that this criti-
cism has not been confined to The
Pitt News. I was disturbed to read
about it in the International Herald
Tribune when l was on sabbatical
leave during 1984-85 in West Ger-
many. I cannot cite details for copy-
right reasons.

Does Pitt need this adverse
publicity?

Paranoia

Here’s a little story to amuse stu-
dents as they begin the school year.

The other day three of my friends
and I were strolling along in front of
the Student Union at Pitt when we
noticed a card table set up at the
corner of Forbes Avenue, across
from the bus stop near the library.
Attached to the side of it was a sign
reading “More nukes —— less kooks.”
Being rather kooky ourselves we
took up what we perceived as a chal-
lenge and approached the table to
argue our side of the matter (being
no-nukes ourselves if you‘re into
labelling people).

As a student of the Russian lan-
guage, these proselytizers believed I
qualiﬁed as a communist sympa-
thizer! “Why else would anyone
want to learn it?" the male member
of the team remarked. “Fire KGB
Profs!” another sign bellowed. The
equation between the Russian peo-
ple and the Soviet goveriiment really
angered me.

To make a long and messy story
short, we didn't leave and sat near
the table to exercise our rights of free
speech, telling all who approached
that there were at least two sides to
every story. Things got tense. First
they tried to be funny, then they
tried to be snide, then they tried to
ignore us. Finally another man
approached the table, very per-
turbed. “You know," he said, “I saw
another sign you had out earlier that
read “Proliferate weapons or Prolif-
erate AIDS." Oneof my friends was
standing near this fellow, and when
he heard this he became very irate at
the people who had coined this cruel
statement. At this point the blonde
female member of the team whipped
out a camera and took my friend's
picture. He then demonstrated the,
fallibility to which all of us human
beings are prone —— he lost his
temper and overturned the table.

   

Letters to the Editor

LaRouche-ettes (did I mention that
the name Lyndon LaRouche was all
over their literature? You've heard
of LaRouche. He’s the guy that
believes Henry Kissinger and Walter
Mondale are Commies. In fact,
anyone who doesn’t agree with him
is a Commie.) “NAZI! NAZI!
FACIST!” The male member
pointed a self-righteous finger at my
now chagrined friend. “Do you want
to be arrested?” None of us moved.
That threat hadn’t worked since the

60’s. Besides, I doubt if these folks

had a permit to be where they were;
and they had “violated" our rights of
privacy by taking our pictures with-
out our permission, certainly as
much as we had “violated” their
rights of free speech (the new refuge
of scoundrels) by exercising our
own.

They took all of our pictures. Now
I am immortalized in‘ a file some-
where,just like J. Edgar Hoover and
the FBI did with Martin Luther
King, Jr. Other interesting moments
include when I asked the male if all
people who lose their tempers are
facists, and he got all red in the face
(no pun intended) and screamed
“YES! YES! "IRRATIONAL
WILL! THAT’S HOW IT
STARTS! IRRATIONAL WILL!
TODAY 'IT’S A TABLE —
TOMORROW YOU’LL BE KIL-
LING MILLIONS OF PEOPLE!!”
(More nukes-less kooks?.) Or the
moment when a stream of black-
garbed Orthodox folk walked past
us, and the male member ofthe team
muttered “Oh no, here it comes.
Now we’re in for it” to the female
member. And a Happy New Year to
you too, brother.

So be prepared students. These
xenophobics are as bad as Moonies
who don’t tell you what they’re
really all about until you hand them
forty bucks. All they know how to
do is-attack. You can see that by
reading their literature. But I don't
want to single them out; there are all
sorts of wild and crazy groups out
there just looking for a bright, young
thing like you (and your bright,
green money). After all, the Labor
Party was just down the street.

try. It can be noted time after time
that “visibility” has been an ROTC
euphemism for a very methodical
attempt to gain academic legiti-
macy. By making themselves more
visible ROTC is testing out its public
image, the possibility of resistance to
their program and ‘ultimately the
feasibility of extending themselves
more deeply into campus life. To
borrow a term from basketball,
Pitt's current ROTC self-
promotional campaign can be
likened to a full—court press in
fatigues.

Smith says, “Today the Army can

afford to be more selective.” The‘

assistant professor of Military
Science, ,Captain Bruce Hart,
explains, “It’s a market system‘and
we’ve got one of the best deals
going.” It is true that the Army can
afford to do a great many things,
including being more selective. It is
not true, however, that ROTC is
part of a market‘ system.

The markets have been effectively
closed, and ROTC represents this
closed monopolistic, militaristic sys-
tem. Student loans, grants and other
forms of federal and state support
for education are drying up. Because
of programs like ROTC — and
campus-based military research —
students and faculty have fewer
choices. Subsequently, the credibil-
ity of -American -higher education
becomes increasingly questionable.

Recently, this intolerable situa-
tion came to a head at Temple Uni-
versity, where ROTC’s visibility was
successfully challenged. And as was
discovered, once ROTC’s visibility
is scratched on the surface, the mili-
taristic entanglement in the univer-
sity becomes clearer.

If you wish to learn more about
the incestuous nature of the
military-industrial-university com-
plex and strategies by which to pro-
mote the univerity as a place of
peace where intellectual develop-
ment and genuine choices can be
made, please contact the offices of
United Campus Ministry, 682-1051.

The Pitt News - September 20, 1985

For the Dissent/Marc Chandler _  
Conflicting Interests of Labor and Management

Thisweek the United States offi-
cially became a debtor nation for the
first time since World War I —
owing foreigners more than they
owe it. Foreign ownership of Ameri-
can factories, real estate, stocks and
bonds exeeds American ownership
of foreign assets. In part, this new
status is a culmination of long-term
secular trends that reﬂect a changing
role for the United States in the
global potitical economy. Many
people of diverse political persua-
sions have anticipated what appears
to many as the inability of the Uni-
ted States to rise to the occasion of
increased foreign competition. A
plethora of national industrial pol-
icy proposals has emerged.
Although there are differences
among them, most, if not all, share a
common core feature: a cooperative
arrangement between capital and
labor for greater productivity and
increased standard of living.

If it were not for being affected by
the "traditional historical bias of
American society, such national
industrial policy advocates as
diverse as the investment banker
Felix Rohatyn, Harvard Professor
Robert Reich and president of the
United States Steel Workers Union,
Lynn Williams, would know that
what they are really advocating is
strengthening the corporative struc-
ture, nascent at the turn of the

ognize the Pitt scholarship recip-
ients at the reception Sunday. After
the reception, all the recipients will
give stage performances. .

“This is an example of what we as

jamin said. “It is a program celebrat-
ing excellence in the arts for people
without the financial wherewithal to
support themselves — a program
that will allow them to go as far as
their talents will take them.

“After all,” Benjamin said, “that’s
what we’re here for.”

The corporative structure runs
parallel to and supplements the for-
mal and constitutional political
structure. This new structure
emerged as capitalists, farmers and
labor sought protection from the
omnipresent marketplace through
organizing. More precisely, the cor-
porative structure presupposes exis-
tence of organizations to represent
functional interests. The corporative
structure integrates the voluntarily
organi-zed interests through a system
of representation in socioeconomic
policymaking. In exchange for par-
ticipating in the corporative struc-
ture, insofar as they receive
recognition, legitimization and sta-
tus, leaders of organized interests,
especially labor, surrender their
right to criticize the framework of
the existing social order.

It seems clear that this was not an
exchange between equals. The self-
sustaining dispersals of power
through organization and counter-
organization along narrow interests
— craft unions, for example, instead
of industrial unions — serves to
undermine ‘class consciousness by
creating a status fetish. The market

_ economy and the division of society

into a class of buyers of labor power
and a class of sellers of labor power,
the ever-increasing concentration of
ownership of capital and the distri-
bution of the social product in

accordance with the marginal pro-
ductivity of producers and factors
(of production) present a strongcase
for the existence of fundamental
inequalities between labor and
capital. '
However, just as the guarantee of
legal and political equity makes the
wage contract appear as an

-exchange of equals in a massively

unequal society, the guarantee of
legal and political equity makes the
social contract appear as an
exchange of equal organized inter-
ests, despite the very real inequalities
between groups in terms of power. It
is an axiom of politics that such
asymmetrical power relations do not
engender such cooperative arrange-
ments which Rohatyn, Reich and
Williams have in mind. Instead they
beget dictation and confrontation.
All national industrial policy pro-
grams erroneously assume that capi-
tal and labor have common interests
in increased productivity and a con-
stantly growing social product. It is
thought that as long as the pie keeps
increasing, everyone will be able to
have a larger piece so that there will
not be a struggle over its distribu-
tion. But we know that many indus-
tries are plagued with excess
capacity, and that growth has its
limits. There are both joint and dis-
tributional gains reaped through
increased competitiveness and pro-
ductivity. National industrial policy

advocates pretend that there are
only joint gains. Consequently, the
distributional gains which clearly
help capital more than labor go
unacknowledged and unexamined.

For example, Lynn Williams‘
steelworkers‘ strike against
Wheeling-Pittsburgh is entering its
tenth week with no end in sight.
Wheeling-Pittsburgh recently mod-
ernized its plant, but it critically
lacks first-rate ﬁnishing facilities.
Consequently, much of Wheeling-
Pittsburgh sales come from less
refined products where price and
import competition are the stiffest.
In a good-faith effort to help their
employers modernize, Wheeling-
Pittsburgh steelworkers have
accepted cuts in wages not once but
twice since 1982. A federal bank-
ruptcy court ruled that the company
could unilaterally annul its existing
labor contract. Thus the path was
cleared for Wheeling-Pittsburgh to
cut wages and benefits by 18 percent
to $1 7.50 (subsequent union analysis
suggests that it would really be
closer to $l5.60 per hour), which
precipitated the strike. Moreover,
increased, productivity frequently
means greater unemployment, espe-
cially in what are commonly called
“smokestack industries" —— like steel
and automobiles. 
Furthermore, industrial policy
advocates assume.what they have to

if ‘         

prove; namely, that managers of
capital ought to negotiate with labor
and do it through union leadership.
Currently, 16 percent of the civilian
labor force is unionized, down from
25 percent_ in I953, its peak year.
“Replacing ,collective bargaining
with dictation and negotiation with
confrontation" is a rational policy
for capital in light of the political
climate created by the current
administration policies and the
impotence of organized labor.

Many of labor’s rights came as
concessions from the state and not
capital. Capital, organized extrale-
gally in pools and trusts before the
Sherman Antitrust Act, legitimized
the corporate form of capital organi-
zation at theend ofthe 19th century.
Labor's right to organize was not
protected until the middle of the
1930s and only after much
bloodshed. The mobility of labor
and its related right to strike remains
precarious and prone to restraining
injunction. Government workers,
like air traffic controllers, are practi-
cally denied the right to strike at all.
Capital knows no such restraints on
its mobility, as it is free to invest or
disinvest whereever it chooses,
regardless of the social implications.
Capital's current offensive is not
informed by the collaborationist
sentiment and trade union mentality
of many of the national industrial
policy advocates.

By Jeff Sewald

Reclined on a backstage sofa,
Gowan (his friends call him Larry)
looked a lot lessylike Britain's blue-
eyed soul sensation Paul Young than
he did from the footlights.

Still aglow following a thunderous

reception at the Syria Mosque as the
opening act for Tears For Fears,
Cowan playfully dodged the physical
comparisons to thegaforementioned
British vocalist and poked some fun
at the fringed, neo-caveman-style
costume he'd been wearing onstage
in support of his latest Columbia
album, Strange Animal.

”It’s supposed to be something like,
if you picked up various fabrics from
the earth and put together an outfit,
what would it look like?" explained
the 27-year-old Canadian singer with
a hoot. '

Nursing a.bottle of Perrier, Gowan
brushed at the strawberry-blond
wisps that mix with his otherwise
dark bangs and chuckled about his
current good fortune. ”An overnight
success after eight years,” he
exclaimed in a mock toast before tak-
ing a swig.

Not long after his birth in Glasgow,
Scotland, Gowan emigrated to Can-
ada with his family, ultimately set-
tling in Toronto.

While professing a genuine love for
ice hockey (as any noble Canadian
would), Gowan admitted that his
preference for music began to surface
at age seven, at which time he per-
suaded his father to buy him a guitar.

But despite all of his attendant
whining and badgering, young Larry
quickly grew tired of the instru-

New music with no borders

. By Stephen Morrison

Critics in this country and in Can-
ada have been scrambling to come up
with fresh adjectives with which to
praise Toronto's Jane Siberry.
Indeed, finding the proper way to
compliment this woman's music is
not an easy task. Her songs ring with
such inventive charm and emotional
clarity that they defy easy descrip-
tion. The critical consensus seems to

be that she is somewhere between a‘

warmer," more accessible Laurie An-
derson and a less pretentious Suzanne

Vega, but such comparisons tend to -

be misleading: Jane Siberry’s musical
vision is entirely her own.

No Borders Here, released on the
Seattle-based Windham Hill label,
appeared late last year with unanim-
ous critical acclaim. Her warm, per-

isonal style betrayed her appren-

ticeship in Toronto coffee-

houses, but the album's electronic
eccentricities belied an adventurous
spirit and a really original musical-
sensibility. You can't help but imme-
diately like her. Her voice is soothing,
crystalline and perfectly on-pitch,
with a whispering quality that makes
it impossible to sit in a room where_'T“»"'.“
her record is playing and give atten-
tion to anything else.

listeners —— you, that is — have a
chance to enjoy Jane Siberry’s unique

' sound tomorrow night at 9 p.m. at

Graffiti (4615 Baum Blvd.).

What can the people who. attend
expect to see?

”It gets pretty intense," Jane Siber-
ry says. ”There are seven people in
the band — two singers, two guitars,
bass, drums, keyboards — and we all
get into it. I think people who come

have a good time. It's a really fun

show.”

Weiss pays

By Carrie Stetler

In this 4-hour theatrical epic, our
hero is a schizophrenic, starving,
bisexual actor named Conrad Ger-
hardt. Stage struck and starry-eyed,
he leaves his native Krautstown, Pa.,
to pursue a career in the Big Apple.
Here, he copulates, starves and sings
with various lesbians, whores, male
escorts and gay policemen.‘

The dizzying, over—long  /ind
That's How The Rent Gets Paid: Part IV (or,
The Confessions of Cor/rad Gerhardt)
appeared at the Graffiti last weekend
as the second presentation of the
Pittsburgh Filmmakers’ Off-Forbes

Festival. As I understand it, Jeff Weiss .

and the Good Medicine ‘Company
have been writing and performing
this unusual and massive production
for the past 15 years. Composed of
over 200 scenes, about 25 are ran-
domly selected each time the work
runs so that every performance is
different. _

This is why  That's How The Rent
Gets Paid is performance art rather

I than just another experimental thea-
-tre piece. What the cumulative effect

of Weiss’s re-creative technique is I
won't venture to guess; at the very
least it guarantees its audience a
bizarre an_d exhaustive evening of
entertainment. a »

Playwright

By~Leslie Bennett

The first Pittsburgh Playwright
Festival continued last weekend at
the Famous Rider Cultural Center
with three short and fairly impres-
sive plays. The fe'stival's' second
group of plays, selected from eight
locally written dramatic works,
included All Good Dreamers by Coni
Koepfinger, On a Stack of Bibles, by Si
Bloom and Mitote by Maisha Baton.
Though all three plays are produc-
tions of the Famous Rider each was
produced with its own cast and direc-
tor, This made for an evening of
diverse styles for diverse interests.
The plays’ themes, however, all
seemed to tie together the ideals of

   

e we...

 And That's How the Rent Gets Paid
opens lightly enough with a senti-
mental overture performed by sin-
ger/actor/piano player Nicky Paraiso.
When this is finished, Weiss, clad in
aqua sweat pants, bounds from the
wings and hands Paraiso a set of cards
with which to introduce each scene.
”We open with Conrad I and his
mother chatting over scrapple in
Krautstown, Pa.,” Paraiso calls. With
that, Weiss leaps on stage to occupy
one of the play’s few props —- a chair.
He portrays both the mild-mannered
Connie Gerhardt and Connie's
mother. Together they have a funny,
scatological argument about toilet

 

manners.

A scene later, Weiss is in Central
Park smoking a joint with a big-
heart/ed but defensive lesbian named
Izzy Stein. Their encounter ends
abruptly enough, and thefollowing
scene features Weiss as a Finnish
homosexual who licentiously rubs his
crotch during a dirty telephone con-
versation. It soon becomes apparent
that Bjorn Zoltan, the Finnish homo-
sexual, is Conrad's murderous alter
ego. The private detective assigned to
trail the schizophrenic Conrad turns
out to be a weight-lifting closet butch

‘who winds up falling in love with _

Conrad.

Throughout the play, no more
than two characters appear onstage
at one time. In almost every scene,
they end up becoming involved in
some perversely‘ comic sexual tryst.
Then they join Paraiso at the side-
staged piano to belt out show tunes
and croon love ballads. Apparently,
they do this to break the tension of
the preceeding scenes and to com-
ment ironically on the weird and
often violent gropings of their
characters.-

Graffiti is a small, cafe-like venue
where there are few barriers, real or
imaginary, between audience and
performer. This proximity might
make the play‘s graphic and largely
homosexual love scenes more than a

 

little uncomfortable for some, but
there was such an oddly romantic
intensity about many of them that
even the most lewd did not seem very
offensive or strange. .

The first two acts of  And That's
How The Rent Gets Paid were consist-A
ently humorous and compelling
because of their break-neck pacing
and satirical wit. All of the actors
gave fine comic performances; Weiss’
was the best owing his overt sensual-
ity and convival cham. However, four

hours proved too long, and by the '

second half of the play, I was eager
for it to end.

There was too little variation "V

among the scenes, and the climax of
the play, where Conrad learns that
his institutionalized sister has just
died, gave way to uncharacteristic

of the three. Depicting an insightful
image of the Afro-American woman
in the American West during the

early 1900s, Mitate, brings together-

three black women on the porch of
the retired school teacher, ‘Miss
Yolanda, for tea and talk. A
Miss Ruth is a weary, spirit-fearing
fortune teller, and Miss Kate, who
"doesn't believe in anything she can't
ride on or eat” is a former ”buffalo
soldier” in the 38th cavalry — a posi-
tion she acquired by pretending she
was a man. .

’’I don't see where no man got no

hearted Miss Kate superbly — a
wonderful character before she even
speaks and a delight to watch and
listen to throughout. A

What is most enthralling about
Mitate, the title referring to "talk of
women” is exactly that. Their stories,
their remembrances, their dreams 
their talk is so full of life, revealing a
too often forgotten chapter of
history.

The mixture of reality and ro-
mance draws the audience effectively
and deeply into the world of these
forsaken women. According to the
playwright, western exploration for
blacks meant ”looking for a city of

gold where no white man can tell no
black man what to do." But what
could have become a didactic sermon
instead remains a sensitive portrait.

performances with the story about a
young woman's inability to cope with

begins with a voiced-over flashback
of the death of Tina's father, an event
four years prior to the time of the

play, which sent Tina (Debbie Carter) ‘

into depression and an attempted sui-
cide. The play proceeds with a series
of encounters with several of Tina's

"Seeing my film is like listening to an
opera and not knowing the language."

— Paul Glabicki

On Saturday, Paul Glabicki, a stu-

dio arts professor at the University of

‘Pittsburgh, debuted his new film,

Object Conversation (1985), at Carnegie
Institute’s film and video section. The

A film succeeded Glabicki’s Film-
~-Wipe-Film (1983), which received
eight national awards, including the
prestigious Silver Hugo Award at the
Chicago Film Festival and the Tho-
mas Edison/Black Maria Film Festival
Award.

Film-Wipe-Film is the film that Gla-
bicki was referring to in the opening
quote, and after viewing this 30-
minute animated work, I must agree
with him. This film was made over
the course of four years, and while it
would have required 40,000 separate
drawings to complete the film, he was
able, through cyclical repetition, to
utilize 15,000 drawings. While this
alone is a feat to commend, the final
film is deserving of a standing
ovation.

/ Film-Wipe-Film is a series of 100
sequences which utilize geometric
patterns to create movement, frame

- by frame, at 24 frames per second. In

other words, Glabicki had to draw a
minimum -of 10 drawings per day in
order to complete the film within
four years, not to mention having to
film each frame singularly; thus, the
labor alone that went into this mas-
terpiece was one of a disciplined pain-
ter/filmmaker, who obviously is in

love with his work.
In order to produce this work, Gla-

lbicki had to finance the film inde-

pendently, since it was verbally
impossible to describe this imagina-
tive abstraction. The film itself is a
series of geometric figures which,
like Walt Disney's Fantasia in a sense,
were choreographed to music,
although this soundtrackﬁis a well-
mixed combination of noises, various
languages and operatic pieces, unlike
Disney's use of classical orchestra-
tion. So it seems that Glabicki has
created a modern-day Fantasia, an
environment of shapes that glide, roll
and flip; but like this age of technol-
ogy and depersonalization, this film is
absent of waltzing hippos and danc-

ing fountains and is filled with
expressionless geometry and emo-
tionless lines. I imagine that Gla-
bicki’s created world is a reflection of
current society, but is this film also a
reflection of the artist's vision of an

_ ideal world?

In his newest film, Object Conversa-
tion, he expands from black and white
to color, which does add more dimen-
sion to the visuals; but like the earlier
film, he continues to create an alien
world and a complex aural environ-
ment. This 10-minute film, like Film-
Wipe-Film, is also filled with an
over-abundance of information, but
with the added use of color, he draws
the viewer's attention to various
shapes, whereas Film-Wipe-Film was

ation ‘brings color to clever images

like choosing to watch one television
program while there are 12 other
programs of interest playing at the
same time. Object Conversation's bright-
est moment is when two boxers move
up the screen and one punches the
other out, which is shown in succes-
sion — if you see something enough
times anything can become funny.
So, while Object Conversation makes
improvements on his common
theme, the film itself is no more com-
prehensible- than the first.

Glabicki does make films which are
visually stimulating, but they seem to
thrive an overly activating the optic
nerve rather than creating environ-
ments which are clever and enter-
taining. I do believe, though, that if
the images were less complex, the
films would become tedious, losing
their overwhelmingly complex
excitement.

Films of this nature are only truly
meant to create moving paintings; so
as an extension of the painting
medium, it is a remarkable tribute to
its creator. Film-Wipe-Film and Object
Conversation are both imaginative and
superbly crafted; I only wish that
they were more accessible and not
quite so dense with visuals. The
viewer never knows what to watch;
and so, many of Glabicki’s clever
images slide off the screen unnoticed.
Keep up the good work, Paul, but
don't sell your images so short by
having so many cluttered on the
screen; they are far too brilliant to
escape into our subconscious
memories.

It has been suggested to me that
perhaps I have been a little hard on
some of the acts I review. To those

who feel that way, I offer this’

response: It's a tough old world out
there, kids.

Getting down to the business at
hand: What have we got this week? A
mixed bag. You may note that I am
not making any particular effort to be
more lenient on-the stuff that rubs
me the wrong way. I can only say that
it is the reviewer's first duty to be
forthright and true to his sensibili-
ties, and I have not compromised
mine. If you don't like it, try writing
your own damn singles column. We
need writers anyway.

Bananarama: ”Do not Disturb”

I must say that I've always soft of
felt sorry for Bananarama — they
sound like eternally adrift backup sin-

gers in search of a lead vocalist. I see -

them floating through some astral
nether-world, doomed to whisper
and chant while others make music.
Poor things. They don't even attempt
to harmonize (an old complaint, I
know, but still valid).

This latest thing of theirs — song,
if you insist — is more of what
they do: the latest, up-to-the-minute,
trendy dance beat and an ingenuous
melody that they all sing in the same
register like a bunch of high school
girls at a slumber party. As such, it
works. Not a bad bit of pulsing Euro-
funk, if you happen to like pulsing
Euro-funk. And, boy, they sure look
nice.

Stewart Copeland: "Gong Rock"

Whenever The Police seemed
about to get swamped in the mire of
Sting’s intellectual musings and phi-
losophical ponderings, Stewart
Copeland always saved the day with
one of his quirky, amusing ditties like
"On Any Other Day” or Miss Gra-
denko." He was The Police's comic
relief, if you will.

Without Sting’s obsessive serious-
ness ‘to provide context, however,
Copeland's music isn't quite as
refreshing, but it is still full of charm.
”Gong R0C1<"' is more of what we
expect of Copeland — an unpredicta-
ble, jarring, anything-but-boring
percussive tour de force. It's completely
instrumental (except for the natives
hollering in the background) and is
filled with a multitude of dueling

rhythms and polyrhythms, as well as '

Copeland's trademark flanged-
guitar-playing-weird-things. There
are even (surprise!) some fiesta horns
that come in halfway through. And‘ it
all ends before it has a chance to get
stale. What will he do next?

ment’s limitations. he opted instead

" for the piano and its superior expres-

sive qualities, a fascination which
eventually led to his enrollment at
the prestigious Royal Conservatory
of Music in Toronto.

"The level of musicianship had shot
way up in the '70s. "And I had been
listening to Genesis and Yes and
knew that I wanted to delve into an
area that was a little bit foreign to
rock—n-roll, I wouldn't be scared to do
it."

The tiny lines around his mouth
that crinkle perfectly when he smiles
are proof enough that, by nature,

_ Gowan is a happy fellow. Having a

father who digs Bruce Springsteen
certainly provides a sense of security,
but the recent successes of his new.
record in Canada have those happy
lines crinkling a lot these days.

But when taking note of his self-
titled debut’s lukewarm reception in
1982, Gowan remembers being con-
fused by the fact that, while some
critics and a number of European
audiences embraced the album, sales
were nevertheless dismal.

"Some people said that the stuff
was behind the. times, while other
people said that it was ahead of the
times. I just thought it was of the
times," he said, shifting in his seat
before taking on a more serious tone.

”I kind of laugh at it now,” he con-
tinued, "but at the time, it was pretty
devastating. I thought, 'Does the
music I'm writing have nothing in
common with current tastes at all?’ "

In an attempt to reunite his feel-
ings with his talents, Gowan spent a
full year with pen and piano and
eventually emerged with a healthy
new batch of songs. '

Confident in their quality, he sent a '

Phil Collins: "Don't Lose My

what he wants. Of course, he used to

tude toward his work with Genesis is
as convincing an indictment of art-
rock as I can think of. But anyway,

Dream Academy: "Life In a North-
ern Town”

In the naturally incestuous world
of pop music, where ideas are contin-
ually borrowed, mutated, and re-
hashed, the word "plagiarism" is
rarely brought in; a case must be par-
ticularly nasty if that word is sued.
This is such a case. Any of you who
has ever heard a song by New Order
called "Your Silent Face" should have
some idea what I'm yelling about.

This song, by Dream (who?)
Academy, is not one-tenth as good as

brings

rough tape to noted British producer
Dave Tickle (of Peter Gabriel and
Platinum Blonde fame), and as the
story goes, Tickle played the tape
while cruising around in his automo-
bile with friends Tony Levin and
Jerry Marotta. Their reaction was
overwhelmingly positive.

”I'll tell you," Gowan said, "the first
couple of days Iwas in the studio with
those guys, I was pretty intimidated.

«But after a while, I was able to focus

on what a great opportunity it was,
and just let go.”

WhatTickle did was streamline the
production and discipline Gowan’s
performance. In essence, he showed
the young musician where he'd gone
astray the first time around.

"On the first record,” Gowan
recalled, "there were a lot of over-
dubs, a lot of extra parts on there that

perhaps made it difficult for the lis-

teners to take in. Dave basically said,
’You write really strong melodies,
and you perform them well. What's
all this other crap you keep sticking in
there?’ "

Tickle’s rule: simplify, simplify.

"He said, ’You can put one key-
board part on there, so makeit a good
one.”

As he tossed about the titles of
some of his headliner’s tunes —
"Shout" came out sounding like
"shoat" by way of his Canadian
accent -_— Larry Gowan shook some
perspiration from his hair and parried
additional Paul Young look-alike jabs
with some shots of his own about
Pittsburgh's less—than—successful
hockey team.

Before long, the conversation
switched back to Strange Animal, as

_ Gowan solicited reactions to his new

anything by New Order. It is brood-
ing, snivelling, pretentious junk full
of pointless political references and
cry-baby "poetry" like "As the train
rolled out of sight] Bye, bye.” I can
hear a lot of teenage girls listening to
this, saying, "Ohhh, that's beautiful,”
but next time this song comes on in
my presence, the radio goes out the
window. Phooey!

Aretha Franklin: ”Freeway of Love"

I have to be a party pooper, but it
occurs to me that amidlall the noise
and celebration over Aretha Franklin
finally getting another hit, no one
noticed that it's a crappy song. ”I'm
riding on the freeway of love"?
Gimme a break! '

This tuneless rant epitomizes the
decay of American soulmusic: Where
it was once a vibrant, vital, inventive,
passionate human outlet, soul is now

_ an irritating parody of its former self.

Yeah, aretha has aged gracefully and
she looks great and she can still sing
and I'm very happy for her. But the
fact that her comeback is based on
uninspired Top 40 drivel is no cause
for celebration.

Prince: ”Pop Life"

On the other hand, there is Prince.
It's taken a long time, but the best
song on Around the World In a Day is
finally an official hit. That means
they play it on the radio a lot, which
suits me fine. I've got my reserva-
tions about Prince like everyone else,

gold for

material. The songs "Criminal Mind"
and ”Guerrilla Soldier” were laid on
the table. The first of the two, a
former No. 1 single in Ottawa (Top 5
nationwide), is now a bona fide gold
record.‘

"I'm pretty amazed,” offered
Gowan with a laugh. "That song?
Come on. -I mean, I'm proud of it and
all, but I didn't think it wasan overtly
commercial-sounding number.”

And given terrorism’s ‘recent
return to the political fore, Gowan
was quick to explain "Guerrilla Sold-
ier,” a tune that he calls "a good old
armchair critic's version of what
happens in foreign countries."

"In North America," he said, ”the
majority of the people view the
world's conflicts through television.
It's strange, but when you see the
local guerrilla soldiers, often they
never look like killers or the do-or-die
types because, at the moment you see
them, they're fascinated by the
media. It always strikes me that
they're putting on a bit of a show, you
know, smiling and waving."

But Gowan shook his head in a
show of disapproval for openly pro-
testational or political songwriting.

"That's one of my peeves," he said.
”When rock gets too self—important.

All I know about being is a rock—n-roll,

singer, and hopefully, I hold up some
sort of mirror as a songwriter. But
I'm certainly not going to tell people
how to live. I think that gets a bit
boring."

As a performer, to be sure, Gowan
is anything but dull. His bouncy, free-
style dancing exudes plenty of the
pent-up frustration that is rock—n-
roll. His performances as Gowan, the
pop star, are a radical, however wel-
come, departure from his reserved

but there's no denying that when he's
got one, he's got one.

' "Pop Life" is full of wry observa-
tions on American culture ("What U

putting in your nose?/ Is that where '

all your money goes?") and it has a
wonderful bass hook that's_ held

together by a simple one-two, one- " "
,two drum beat so easy that even

Sheila E. couldn't play-it. The song's

message is worded with such lack of’

grace that it manges to be convincing:

"Life it ain't real funkyl Unless it's got

that pop." Hey, man, I agree.

This song seems to be so univer-

say something in its defense. While it
is a song written for a movie, a crime
for which no punishment short of
death could be suitable, it manages to
avoid most of the bovie-music cliches
inherent in the genre. It is well-
crafted, precisely timed, and the sud-
den swell of the chorus gets exactly
the goos'e—bumps-up-the-neck effect
that it was calculated to get. What I'm
saying is that this song is contrived,

Music in the '80s has seen a resur-
gence of bands brimming with fresh
ideas and youthful exuberance. Two
groups noted for their vigor and orig-

~ inality are Scotland's Big Country

and Ireland's U2. They are part of a
new breed of rock musicians whose
styles seem wholly fresh; but what is
not so obvious is that to create their
”new” sounds, they draw, con-
sciously or not, on traditional folk
music —— in this case, the Celtic music
of Ireland and Scotland.

The second Pittsburgh Celtic Festi-
val is showcasing musicians who play

Old soundsfrom across the

songs that span the venerable history
of Celtic music. This tradition still
thrives in Ireland and Scotland, and
the range and richness of these
band's repertoires offer convincing
proof. The festival consists of five
concerts that run through mid-
October at Graffiti on Baum
Boulevard.

Kinvara, a quartet of intensely tal-
ented Irish musicians, led the festival
with a breathtaking performance
Sept. 12. Their eclectic set featured
jigs, reels and affecting ballads that
demonstrated ' the remarkable voice
of Delores Keane, one of Ireland's
premier traditional singers. The jigs
were highlighted by the fiddle play-

Further performances in the festi-

Antionette McKenna, an Irish duo on
pipes, harp and vocals, Oct. 9; and
Relativity, featuring John and Phil
Cunningham of Scotland's renowned
Silly Wizard, Oct. 17.

These shows are a must for anyone
with a wee bit o’ Gaelic blood in his
veins or with an interest in Celtic tra-
dition. It may be the last chance for a
while for Pittsburghers to hear this
swirling, distinctive music first—hand.

are $7 in advance and $9 at the door.

Jane Siberry: making music withno borders

continued from page 7

Given her penchant for unor-
thodox time signatures and tricky
rhythms, one might worry that the
band may occasionally get lost. But,
she claims, ”Not at all. I have trouble
keeping up with them.”

Jane and company are now into the
second week of their first major tour,
promoting their new record, Speclcless
Sky. The album, according to Siberry,

- is an evolution in her sound but not a

departure: ”It’s like No Borders Here,
the same instrumentation. Some of
the songs might be a little more
accessible. More conventional beats.
The single has been getting airplay, a
song called ‘One More Color.’ ”

Will the album be a commercial

Momentum is something that she
certainly has. No Borders achieved
national distribution this summer via
Open Air Records, a California—based
subsidiary of Windham Hill, drawing
immediate favorable attention from
the likes of Rolling Stone, Billboard, High
Fidelity, and The New York Times, who
applauded her ”brilliant and delicate
touch." All the praise, however, has
not gone to her head.

”I don't think about it,” she says.
”You have to just take it as it comes,
one hurdle at a time. You can't let
yourself get too pre-occupied with
what they [the critics] say.

”I want to keep my music accessible .

to those people who want to hear it.
Obviously, I'd like to reach as many
people as possible. But I don't want to

Can she envision herself playing
Madison Square Garden?

”That's pretty big, isn't it?”

Jane is from Canada, remember.

Jane Siberry is definitely a per-

former to watch during the coming
year. There may be, in reality, plenty
of borders in our world, but the suc-
cess that this talented artist deserves
and appears to be heading for has no

. borders at all.

Videos: are they £1 shot in the arm or a kick in the teeth-7

By Stephen Morrison

Lene Lovich, the eccentric pop sin-
ger,, once made a rather succinct
observation. She said, ”I like to listen
to classical music because you can
make up a different story every
time.” That sentiment also holds
true, in a way, for all ojtherjmusical
forms. While some types of music,
such as folk ballads, obviously tell
stories that don't vary each time they
areplayed, the emotional effect that
one gets from a musical composition

‘is ever-changing and continuously

fresh. That's why you can hear a song
that you like over and over without
getting tired of it: the shades of aural
nuance register differently with each

. listening, and new aspects of a song

always present themselves. Music,
then, is the most subjective of all art
forms. There is no ’ ”middle—man"

between the art and the human

response. A writer needs paper and a
painter his easle, but music goes
straight into the ear and -into the
brain. It is a_ very personal experience,

yet everyone can have it. Anyone can
”have" any work of music all to
himself.

But now we have entered into the
age of ”music video” and we are pres-
ented with a whopping philsophical
inconsistency: How does one recon-
cile the very definition of music with
the rigid, unchanging set of images
that a video presents? The video,
whether we like it or not, becomes a
part of the thoughts and images that
make up the way we think about the
song and the emotion that we feel
when we hear it, even if it merely
shows the artist performing.

One argument contends that the
difficulty lies in determining the

V quality of the video. If a video is well-

[I

executed and ”appropriate, no one
could logically argue that it is still a
detriment to the song. A good video
enhances our perception of a song
while a bad video does the opposite.
Yet how does one determine the

- quality of a video? Is that not wholly

subjective? There are some obvious
criteria one could examine, such as

inventiveness, quality of production
and so on, but in the end, attempting
to separate ”good” videos from the
”bad” ones would be a frustrating and
self-defeating exercise. Do we then
declare the ”bad" videos trash and
praise the ”good" videos as art? Fol-
lowing this line of thinking to its logi-
cal conclusion, one can envision a
congressionally appointed ”Art Com-
mittee" that would declare artistic
standards and decide what artists live
or .die. Clearly, this is'not the way to
go.

Another option would be to con-
demn the entire medium, to say that
videos are decadent and have no place
in a civilized world. That, of course, is
rather insane. ' e '

The solutionliist toilook‘ calmly at ’

videos for what they are — an entity
separate from the song itself. If you
don't like the video, don't watch it.
There is no reason, simply because
the medium of video is a visual one,
that it must dictate the images that
accompany a song in the mind. We
are not, after all, computers. Human
beings are entirely capable of accept-
ing some bits of information while

rejecting others. A video does not
force a totalitarian concept of a song
upon the listener/viewer. The indi-
vidual is still left to enjoy the. song as
much, to ”have” it as much, as though
he had never seen the video.

Like television in general, music
video does not seem to be standing
the test of time in terms of establish-
ing itself as a viable art form. While it
can occasionally be brilliant, most
often it is a ”Madison Avenue pro-
duct” churned out for a consumer
society. Still, its potential for great-
ness, as well as its extreme youth,
should tell us that we need to give it
some time and some room to breathe.

Videos do not become an indissolu-

'  ble part ‘of’ the -r’n‘usic”to which they.__.
 are attached. Music is still mu'sic,'"._
' whether we like videos or not, and we V

are still free to pick and choose what
we feed into our heads. Some say that

the advent of the video age has sealed ..

the fate of the already decaying popu-‘V
lar music industry. I don't think so. It
is better to look at video as a dynamic
new medium, full of faults but full of
potential, linking arms with popular
music but not joining it at the hip.

The Pitt News - September 20, 1985

Despite 1-2 record,  
Eagles are conﬁdent

By Jim Urban
Sports Editor

Boston College made great strides
last year with Heisman Trophy
winner Doug Flutie at the helm of
the offense. The Eagles went 10-2,
their best record since 1954's 8-1,
and they capped last season with a
Esotztgn Bowl victory over Houston,

Well,{' Flutie is gone, and with him
went the easier schedule. Right now,
the Eagles are 1-2, with losses to
defending national champion
Brigham Young and to Maryland.
Head coach Jack Bicknell thinks
that even if Flutie were still there, the
Eagles would nonetheless be amisdt
tough times.

"‘I’ll tell ya, in all honesty, we
could be struggling with Doug Flu-
tie right now,” said Bicknell. “Any
coach would miss a player of that
caliber, but we got over that in the
spring. We are pretty happy with the
kids and the way they’re playing.
Some of the results of some of the
games I would like to change, but
we’re happy the way things are
going."

Bicknell returned some key play-
ers from last year’s Cotton Bowl

As I see it

Holmes may pass Marciano in wins, but not in ability

Tomorrow night could be one of
the saddest nights in boxing history.
Or it could be the night when many
of the older fight fans will finally
breathe that long-awaited sigh of
relief. Unfortunately, the former has
the better chance of happening.

In Las Vegas tomorrow, Michael
Spinks will be trying to save boxing
from yet another black eye by strip-
ping Larry Holmes ofthe IBF Heav-
yweight Championship. If Spinks is
successful, Holmes’ drive to equal
Rocky Marciano’s record of 49 wins
without a loss will be halted. It's a
record which Holmes does not
deserve to reach.

When Marciano retired and peo-
ple began to reﬂect on his career and
his record, they found it to be a life-
long great'performance. His career
is not clouded by question or doubt.
The same cannotbe said of Holmes’
career. Even if Holmes should defeat
Spinks, then go on to defeat another
opponent and retire with a record of

50-0, his achievements in the.ring_

would still in no way rival those of
the “Brooklyn Blockbuster.”

The most obvious reason to con-
sider Marciano’s unbeaten mark
more of an achievement is that it
came against opposition of far better
quality. Eleven months before he
was to win the heavyweight cham-
pionship of the world, Marciano
met Joe Louis. After he easily I(O’ed
Louis in eight rounds, fight fans
blamed it on “The Brown Bomber’s"
advancing years.

But even an aging LOUIS would
have knocked out a young Tim
Witherspoon inside of five rounds,

. yet Witherspoon was one punch

away from taking the title from
Holmes in their championship bout
just a few short years ago.

Another man who had Holmes in

Tailback Troy Stradford

champions, but he lost, in addition
to Flutie, some other players who
made key contributions.

“We got seven kids who are
seniors and in their last year,” said

‘Bicknell. “But we have eight kids

who played for their first time
against Brigham Young, their first
start. We’re experienced in some
areas and inexperienced in other
areas. We would have been more
experienced without some injuries in
some key spots, but that’s all part of
it.”

serious trouble was Renaldo Snipes.
After Snipes scored a knockdown
against Holmes in the seventh round
of their fight, only Snipes’ inexperi-
ence kept him from knocking out a
wobbly Holmes.

But that is just how Holmes has
been able to retain his title and his
unbeaten record. He has time and
again fought inexperienced and
unqualified (for a title shot) fighters.
Marvis Frazier, in all honesty,

would never even have a chance if he

fought his 41-year-old father. Yet
‘Holmes gave hirrY‘”a title shot to
boost his record closer to
Marciano’s. i

And who can forget his classic
confrontation with Gerry Cooney?
Cooney received a title shot despite
never having faced-a ranked oppo-
nent. And even sadder is the fact that
Cooney actually gave Holmes trou-
ble. Anyone who has ever seen Mar-
ciano fight or seen films of his fights
will tell you that if Cooney fought
the absolute fight of his life — if he
fought to the ultimate level of his

abilities — he would have lasted,

about eight rounds. And then Mar-
~ ciano would have knocked him cold.

Then there are the fighters who
should have been easy workouts for
Holmes, but who, unbelievably,
gave him fits. Will someone please
explain how Lucien Rodriguez and
Trevor Berbick went the distance
with a man who is supposed to be the
equal of Rocky Marciano? Rodri-
guez would have lasted two rounds
at best against “The Rock." Berbick,
who knew nothing of defense when

~ he fought Holmes, would have been

at the mercy of Marciano’s crunch-
ing fists from the outset, and could
have been counted out at any time
from the first round onward. Yet
Holmes never even threatened a
knockout in either of these fights.

Sports

Despite the two losses, Bicknell is
not panicking. In fact, he seems con-
fident, although the Eagles could
leave the Steel City with a ‘I-3
record.

“These kids have been through
some big games,” -he said. “They
KIIOW how to play, they really know

' how to practice, I’m very pleased

with their effort, and I think we’re
going to be fine."

One person who is not fine is star
tailback Troy Stradford. The senior
from Linden, N.J., was one of the
few bright spots in the season open-
ing loss to BYU. Stradford rushed
for over 100 yards against the Cou-
gars, but he has been hampered by
injuries of late.

“Troy Stradford is a great player,
and he’ll be out,” reported Bicknell.
“He’s still got some pain in the

hamstring — and the hamstring, you ,

just can’t rush it. If we pushed him to
get ready this week, he could maybe

play, and then he’d miss three more ‘

weeks.”

Quarterback Shawn Halloran
inherited the job from Flutie, and
now much of the offensive load is on
his shoulders. With the injuries at
tailback, where the top three on the
depth chart missed the Maryland
game, Halloran has had to pick up
the slack.

“In this part of the country, in our
end, there are a lot of people who
don’t think he is playing very well,”
said Bicknell, “but I think he played
very well these last couple weeks.”
Bicknell admitted, “In spots, he had

continued on page 18

Scott Frank and James “Bone-
cruncher” Smith" are two more
examples of men who would have
been thoroughly throttled by Marci-
ano. In fact, they would probably
never have gotten title shots. Yet
“Bonecruncher” gave Holmes all he
could handle.

Holmes’ best opponent was the
man he took the title from, Ken Nor-
ton. But even then, Holmes fell short
of Marciano.

When Marciano won the title, it
was in one of the greatest-ever title
fights, against Jersey Joe Walcott.
Walcott himself was better than
Holmes, and Marciano defeated
him twice in eight months. The first
came via a l3th-round knockout in
which Marciano first became cham-
pion. The winning blow was consid-
ered by many to be one of the
hardest-ever in the history of the
ring. That punchjust happened to be
an overhand right, the same punch
that a very average-hitting Snipes
used to send Holmes to the canvas.
Hmm! The second win over Walcott
was a first-round KO. That speaks
for itself.

While Holmes has ducked men
like Greg Page, Gerrie Coetzee,
Michael Dokes (when he was in
shape), Pinklon Thomas, and a
rematch with Witherspoon, Marci-
ano fought the best of his time. He
twice defeated Ezzard Charles (a
decision win in IS, and a K0 in 8),
who was also arguably better than
Holmes.

Many measure a ﬁghter’s great-
ness by his ability to defeat other
great fighters. Marciano defeated
great fighters six times — Joe Louis
once, Walcott and Charles twice
each,’ and ironically, light heavy-
weight champ Archie,Moore in his
49th and final appearance. Holmes,

Injuries, Michigan
State too much for
women Panthers

By Kellie Butt
For The Pitt News

Sometimes losses are the best
thing that can happen to a team.‘ In
the case of the Pitt women’s volley-
ball team, Coach Collier is hoping
that the recent setback will spur on
the team’s development. Collier
acknowledged, “We still have a long
way to go before we will be a really
good team. We are going to have to
develop more game experience as a
team."

Following a win over Duquesne in A

three matches, the Lady Panthers"
faced a tough squad from Michigan
State. The Spartans handed Pitt
their third loss of the season versus
six wins. The Lady Panthers started
fast and furious, jumping to a quick
13-2 lead. Michigan State snapped
and took the match from Pitt. From
there, the game was essentially the
Spartans’. Collier noted, “We
played fairly strongly, but we did not
handle the comeback storm. Michi-
gan State was playing their last
match (against Pitt) on a long Big
East tour, and I think they were just
determined to go home with a win.”

With the Duquesne and Michigan
State matches behind them, the
Lady Panthers must look ahead to a
stiff weekend schedule. They will be
playing seven matches at the Temple

tournament (Princeton and Akron ’

on Friday night; Providence, Tem-
ple and the championship matches
on Saturday) and continue playing
through Sunday afternoon.
Opening up the Big East Confer-
ence against Providence in the Tem-
ple tournament will begin another
challenge for Pitt. After the Temple
tournament, the Lady Panthers
travel to Seton Hall for a game Sun-
day morning. Following this game,
it will be on to Villanova for a Sun-

—day afternoon game.

Playing this schedule will be phys-
ically and mentally demanding

enough without other complica-

tions. However, with Kris Wexell

still out with an injury and Sally Gil- -

lespie out, some of the Panthers‘ sta-
bility has been taken away. Junior
Sue Hoover will be playing during
the weekend following a bout with a
pulled leg muscle. For at least this
weekend’s action, the Panthers will
be forced to rely heavily on the less
experienced underclassmen to
shoulderthe burden of leadership.
Reﬂecting on Wednesday's loss,
Collier stated, “Even with Lisa
Stewart and Kris Wexell out, we
should have been in a position to
win. It was a disappointing loss.”
However, the Lady Panthers can-
not stop to think about their recent
loss for too long. They have a full

slate to contend with this weekend.

By Jim Brueckner

IBFiHeavyweight hampion Larry Holmes
faces Michael Spinks this Saturday

 

meanwhile, barely escaped with
wins over Norton, Shavers and
Weaver.

One other fact that cannot be
denied is that Carl “The Truth” Wil-
liams was robbed in one ofthe worst
decisions in boxing history. Willi-
ams clearly outboxed the champion
over the first 12 rounds oftheir con-
troversial bout. He appeared to have
won at least l0, if not all, of the first
'2 rounds.

It is interesting to note that a lot of
money is to be made if Holmes can
break Marciano’s record.

The final argument is the inevita-
ble question of an actual “Holmes
vs. Marciano." True, Marciano was

small (5-10, 185 lbs.) for a heavy-

weight, but everyone was relatively '

smaller 30-40 years ago. Today, they
are closer to 280 lbs. If Marciano

would have been born 30 years later, '

he would havebeen about six feet
tall and wieghed about 200-205 lbs.

Marciano would have dismantled
Holmes in five or six rounds. If he
would have done it in one round, I
would not have been surprised.
(Remember the overhand right; that
would have been the punch).

Please, Michael Spinks, knock
out Larry Holmesand preserve the
record of an American hero -
Rocky Marciano. '

Students

invited to
another
Pitt-nic before

Pitt-BC game

There is an old saying that tells us
to stick with a good thing when we
find it. The Pitt athletic department
is apparently holding to that by
announcing the return of the Pitt-
Nic.

The successful pre-game party
that was held outside Pitt Stadium
at the Purdue game will be back for
this Saturday’s Boston College
game. Only this time, the location
has been moved to Forbes Avenue in
front of the law building.

Entertainment will be provided by
the Pitt band and Pitt cheerleaders
and the nutty Panther mascot.

The action begins at 10 a.m.

. . . to information from
the Federal government is
available to you at more
than 1,380 Depository Li-
braries across the country
You can visit any of these
libraries and use the De-
pository collection free of
charge. To ﬁnd the Federal
Depository in your area,
contact your local library
or write to the Federal
Depository Library
Program, Ofﬁce of the
Public Printer, Washington,

some bad mistakes which inexpe-
rienced quarterbacks will have, but 1
think he’s coming along, and I have
no ideas of making a change. Shawn
g Halloran’s our quarterback, and I
think he’s getting better every week.”

Pitt graduate assistant John
Brown (yes, the same guy who won
the 1982 Sugar Bowl) scouted the
Eagles and had some interesting
thoughts to offer.

“They remind me a lot of our
team,” said Brown. “There’s not a
lot of big names on the team. We're
both kind of .blue-collar teams.”

As far as Halloran is concerned,
Brown echoed Bicknell’s thoughts.

 

  Eagles are confident

“They have a pretty good quarter-
back,” said Brown. “He’s improving
every week, and he’s filling some
pretty good shoes.”

iHalloran should be comfortable
with the receiving corps, Brown
noted. “I think the strength of their
offense lies in their receivers,”
explained Brown. “This Kelvin
Martin [a 5-9 junior from Jackson-
ville, Fla.] is a very dangerous
receiver. He caught two touchdown
passes [last week], one in a crowd.”

So things have a way of changing
in a year’s time. Flutie is gone to
New Jersey, and he even got mar-
ried. Flutie is the past, Halloran is
the present, and Bicknell hopes a
victory over Pitt lies in the future.
