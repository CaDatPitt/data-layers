. By DOT HUDSON
as told to
DAVE WINTER

I don’t feel any different, and I’m disappointed!

My arm felt asleep for a couple of seconds, but
it didn’t last. You want me to tell you everything
that happened?

Well, ﬁrst I registered as a blood donor. Then»
they asked me for. my written permission from my
parents, since I’m not 21 yet, and I discovered that
I had left it in my notebook back at school.

They were sorry, but said positively that I
couldn’t give blood unless I had a note giving per-
mission, so I had to go over to Jenkins Arcade,
where my sister is a doctor, and get her to write me
a note.

Physical Checkup First

They said that was okay when I came back, so I
went to the nurse at the ﬁrst desk and she took my
pulse and temperature, . I . ".

At the next desk the nurse took my blood pres-
sure with a sphygnomon—well, you pronounce it!
She also pierced my ﬁnger and took a drop of blood
which she tested for hemoglobin in a test tube full
of blue copper sulphate. If my blood didn’t have
enough iron in it, the nurse told me, _it would have
‘bounced. back upiinstead of ﬂoating down, and they
'wouldn’t have let the donate. -.

I wasn’t reallyinervous anytime, but I did feel _

a little bit shaky when I ﬁrst laid down. But they

needle in, and I just had the dull sensation that it
was going into the vein.

I was surprised, really, because the only “pain”
I felt was the prick of the novocaine needle at ﬁrst, -
and though I winced because-I expected it to hurt,
it was no worse than the needle prick for the iron

_ test.

0nly.Takes 3 Minutes

Although registration and everything took-about
35 minutes, it only took about“ seven minutes to do-
nate my pint. Thenurse had given me a roll of
gauze that I kept squeezing, “to make your veins
big,” she said. Curious, I asked her, “Is every-

body’s blood the same color?, She said, “Just about.

It’s all veinous. _

When the bottle was full, ‘a nurse took me by the
arm (in case I felt weak, I guess) and took me out
to the snack bar. You’re not allowed to leave for

half an hour anyway, so I had some free coffee and I

donuts. 7

One of the nurses sat down and talked-with me
a minute. She said that all blood donated is on its
Way to Korea before 10 p.m. the same“night. They
deliver it by plane and helicopter, sometimes right
at the front lines orhat emergency hospitals right
behind the lines. '

Students can pledge blood for the current Stu-
dent Congress—sponsored campaign by signing a
regular pledge card at the Student Desk. Congress
still needs 252 pledges to bring a Red Cross blood-L

By JIM DICKEY

-' Pitt’s School of Nursing has
1 taken over Ellsworth Center.
" The’ Nursing School has

it been holding classes there

;regularly since ‘Sept. 26, ac-

”cording to Ruth Perkins

"Kuehn, dean of the School

“ iof*Nursing. ‘ -

Seven Hospitals Represente
Students from seven hospitals

' aiﬁliated with the University are

attending classes there. These are
Magee Hospital, Children’s Hos-

Astpital, Presbyterian Hospital, Eye
' “and Ear Hospital, Municipal Hos-
I _.'pital, Western Psychiatric Institute

and Clinic, and Falk Clinic.
— According to Dean Kuehn, this

"is only temporary until facilities

are available for the School of
iNursing in*the new Medical Cen-

The Dean went on to say that
right now a period of reconstruc-
tion is taking place at the center in
which .most of the rooms are being
re-arranged and the interior of the

- ' building is being re-decorated.

..A ‘ free bus service is furnished
by the University to carry the stu-
dents back and forth between their

" _respective hospitals.

_ Girls Happy

Dean Kuehn said that the girls
seem to like Ellsworth Center, and
that one of the reasons is that the
football team holds daily practice
on the adjoining ﬁeld. 1

Practice is also held there for
the junior varsity and the fresh-
men squads. All of the equipment
for the teams is located there ac-
cording to George Kenneth, Busi-
ness Manager of Athletics.

Fine Arts Show of French Prints
Credited With Aesthetic Appeal

The collection of French prints soon to ‘be displayed at
the 7th ﬂoor Fine Arts gallery has «an “aesthetic

appeal.” '~

Art—lovers will ﬁnd these prints
a source of information and in-
spiration, said Walter R. Hovey,
head of the department of ﬁne
arts. “We consider it one of the
most important shows in that
these prints convey more forceful
impressions than the painting,” he
added. ~ ‘

Intended to supplement the ex-
hibit‘ of French paintings at the
Carnegie art galleries, this collec-
tion is a ﬁne exhibit of quality of
impression and the artists repre-
sented. *

The exhibit will open Oct. 18.

Have ‘Spirit,
Enthusiasm

The incoming freshmaii class,
though smaller by about 150 stu-
dents, seems to have more spirit
and enthusiasm than the men who

’ entered last September.

Richard Cunningham, advisor to
Men’s Council, ' and assistant to
the dean of men, believes that
the new class is more inclined to

V . take part in fraternity rushing ~

events and 'freshman orientation
than previous classes.

Cunningham did point out that

the attendance at the MC and In-
ter-Fraternity Smokers was con-
siderably less than expected and
far below last year’s ﬁgures. Holi-
days and a full schedule of rush-
ing events were blamed for the
poor ‘ﬁgures. The MC‘ Smoker, Oc-
tober 9, drew approximately 60.

V frosh while the IF affair did ‘little

better’ with 85.

_ These facts came out at a re-
cent 'Men’s Council gneeting and
were the subject of much discus-
sion. .

Jack Burwinkle, MC president,
requested that counselors get on
the job, after the rushing events

have_ died down, and see that

freshman are attending their ori-
entation classes, and wearing their
dinks as required.
