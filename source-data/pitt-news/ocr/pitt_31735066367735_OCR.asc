Freshman Study Shows Rise

In Females, Younger Students

According to the 1960 Freshman Study, recently re-
leased bythe Ofﬁce of Institutional Planning‘, an increased

percentage of females and

younger students entered as

freshman in 1960 over the percentages in the 1959 freshman

enrollment.

Free Book Return

The main‘ library of the Uni-
versity announced that the week
of -May 22 will be set aside for
“Operation Book Return,” a plan
to encourage students to return
overdue books without paying the
usual ﬁnes. .\

The plan was instituted as the
'University’s answer to the recent
drastic legal measures taken by
public libraries, to have overdue
books returned. It was stated that
many of the overdue books are
urgently needed for use in course
and research work.

¢Montgomery, is a staff for the
Chancellor. They prepare studies
and advice‘ on education and ad-
ministrative planning.

The survey took four months
and was done by three ‘people.
They were helped by the Office of
Student ‘Records and a computer.
The computer gave statistical
calculations on information sup-
plied by the Office. “

Last year, the ﬁrst year of the
survey, hurried calculations were
right on the nose, especially con-
cerning the number of freshmen
attending the third trimester.

By. studying the characteristics
of ﬁve groups of variables: per-
sonal characteristics, educational
background, economic character-
istics, and college matriculation,
the Office was able to predict
trends in future freshman groups
and plan for them.

The 1960 freshmen showed an

Quintile Rank over the 1959

group, 5 being the top quin'tile.'
As the age of the student and

the income of his family increases,

" so does the likelihood of three-

term attendance. -

The occupational level of the
parents and the family income of
the 1960 group are higher than
those of the 1959 group. The high-
er the occupational level of the
father, the more likely the student
is to be enrolled in the School of
Liberal Arts.

J By BILL DeCARBO

Angels have been cele—
brated in literature and song

for centuries, but here at the,
University “angels” are hon-

ored by the human counter-

part of sky dwellers, the
United States Air Force.

Angel Flight, as 'the group is
called in Air Force lingo, is the
woman’s auxiliary wing of col:
lege Air Force‘ ROTC units across
the country. The organization
often works in conjunction with
Arnold Air Society, an honorary
fraternial group for Air Force
ROTC candidates. is

The University has an active
Angel Flight of 15 girls, who lend
their support to many of the
ROTC social functions. Listed
among their activities are helping
with the Military Ball, hostessing
Parents Night for the Air Force
ROTC, participating , in the
Chancellor’s Review, and parading
on Armed Forces Day.

Troop Commander

Kathy Malcolm commands the
University’s Angel Flight, and has
the rank of lieutenant colonel.
The other officers on her staff are
Executive Officer Lee Hagemeier,
Administrative Officer Carole
Kuhn, Comptroller Sally Matis,
Information Officer Alice Jones,
and Chaplain Joan Roche. They
all have the rank of captain.

Most of the girls are recent
pledges, having been admitted

around the end of March. In

September Angel Flight will be

initiating again.
, Members otherthan. the execu-
.tive’staff are: Linda McKensey,
Sandy Massimino, Sandy Cartiss,
Inez Manion, Mary Anderson,
Anna May Tawlak, Polly Schalz,
Linda Gordon, and Wanda Kind.

A little known fact is that any

female undergraduate at the Uni- ,

versity may apply for member-
ship. However, she must take her
views on why she wants to join

Angel Flight has a three-fold
purpose ,——- to advance and pro-
mote interest in the Air Force, to
obtain information about military

Few Changes

No drastic deviations from the
original plans were made in the
rooms which will be incorporated
in the new men’s dormitories
which are scheduled to be com-
pleted by July, 1963. This re-
sulted from the recent mock dor-
mitories experiment.

The four students‘ who took
part in the experiment by living
in the dormitories for a week gave

but there were some complaints.

It was found that there was
strong opposition to such things as
metal furniture, bunched sockets,
closet space and other small items.

As a result of these" various
criticisms the» furniture in one
room was changed completely
around, metal furniture was re-
moved from the other, sockets
were changed, and other minor
alterations were made.

Two different types of rooms
will be used. The basic difference;
between the two rooms is inithe‘
type of furniture and the lighting.
This will give the students a bit
of variety and perhaps enable
them to choose the room most
suitable to their individual tastes.

TILL. WE MEET AGAIN “

Seven yogi-s now I have been writing this column for the
makers of Marlboro (ligarctites, and each your when I come to
the last column of the year, my heart is gripped by the same
bittersweet feeling. I shall miss you sorely, dear readers, in the
long summer days ahead. I shall miss all you freckle-faced
boys" With frogs in your pockets. I shall miss all you pig-t.ailed
girls with your gap—toothed giggles: I shall miss you one and
all——your shining morning faces, your apples, your marbles,
your jacks, your little oilcloth satchels.

But  shall not be entirely sad, for you have given me many
a happy memory to sustain me. It has been a rare pleasure
Writing this column for you all year, and I would ask every
one of you to come visit me during the summer except there is

no access to myiroom. The makers of Marlboro Ciga.rettes,i

after I missed several deadlines, walled me in. All I have is
a mail slot into which I drop my columns and through which
they supply me "with Marlboro Cigarettes and such food as
will slip through a mail slot. (For six months now I hzive been
.liVing_on after—dinner mints.)

I am only having‘ my little joke. The makers of Murlboros
have not walled me in. They could never do such :1 cruel thing.
Manly and nuisculnr they may be, and grull and curt and direct,
but underneath they are men of great heart and sweet, com-
passionate disposition, and I Wish to take this opportunity to
state publicly that I will always have the highest regard for
the makers of Marlboro Cigarettes, no matter how my lawsuit
for back wages comes out.

I am only having my little joke.  am not suing the makers
of Marlboros for back vvages. These honorable gentlemen have
always paid me promptly and in full. To be sure, they have not
paid me in cash, but they have given me something far more
precious. ’ou would go lit!‘ to ﬁnd one so covered with tattoos  I.

I am only having; my little joke. The makers of l\l,arlb0ro.3
have not covered me with tattoos. In fzict, they have engraved
no commercial a(lVcrti.<ing; wlizitsocvcr on m_v person. My suit,
of course,  anotlicr l‘l'Izlll'f‘I‘, but even here they have exercised
taste and rcstmint. On the back of my suit, in unobtrusive
neon, they have put this fctcliiiig little jingle:

On the front of my suit, in muted phosphorus, are pictures of
the mcrnl)crs of the Mai-lboro board and their families. On my
hat is a small cigarette girl crying, “Who’ll buy my Marlboros?’3

I am only having my little joke. The makers of Marlboros
have been perfect dolls to work for, and so, dear readers, have
you. Your kind response to my nonsense has warmed this old
thorax, and I trust you will not ﬁnd me soggy if in this final
column of the year, I express my sincere gratitude.

The recent cease‘-ﬁre (?) in Laos should raise no
false hopes" in the Western world as to the softening
of the communist ‘position. Nor should this truce
let Westerners believe that another crisis area is
now no longer in danger of exploding into a con-
ﬂict of greater magnitude. , '
We have lost Laos, or if-not," are close to it. And
if one accepts the “falling domi- S
no” theory ﬁrst set forth by the
Eisenhower administration, the 
entire Southeast Asian area is in
grave danger of being lost by the
Western World.

4 The comm.unis’ts'*have‘ made
great inroads into the Western
Hemisphere.‘ They have moved
to_a position of some inﬂuence, in
‘the Middle East. "And they are
_busy -in Africa. Now, or in the II '
future, we cannot afford to lose 4 _ g g
the Southeast Asian area to the communists. Our
losses have been too great and too many to permit
us to‘ recover from such a blow.  

 

I ‘_.Yet, there‘. appe.arsifto' be -three, alternatives to

4 , follow, now. The ﬁrst isto write off the areasitlass a
' .9-bad investment, and a trooublesomie spot, not-‘worth

_. The second alternative is military intervention.‘
This would have to be aWful1—scale military move
by [the ‘United ' States, for our experience "in Laos
has showed us -that mass quantities of, weapons are
not enough to instill a ﬁghting spirit into troops
that have no desire’ to ﬁght.‘ ' ‘ A ' ’

But this is not a desirable “alternative. In the
ﬁrst place, our chances of winning suchwa limited;
war would be practically zero. Ina recent column.

During the trial.of_Dr.,Edward H. Sebastian, a" ‘-
dentist who frowned upon extractions and special-' “

ized in decayin-gs‘ white teeth, ,Defense Attorney
Louis ‘C- Glasso raised the question, I “How A did

(John) “Fridley and (Dick). Falenski get into.Pitt’s. 

Dental School?” -

~Slouched at the rear of the courtroom, I~‘mulled
over the inquiry, stirring up ‘ "C
doubts that "had persisted’ in my
Lmind ever since a‘ poison pen
letter reached‘ my desk concern-
ing my column"»“Fixing the ‘Fix’,"‘
(March 22) in which I portrayed
Fridley and Falenski as models
to be imitated ,by those ap-

Disgusted Senior wrote: “I
was under the impression that
only students of the ;highest_cali- .
ber were admitted into the Den--'— , ,
tal School. Those two only hadQfP.A.’s ‘of 2.3,
perhaps there was a-ﬁx afterall” I might addthat

 

a C grade‘ is valued as 2 points, thus a 2.3 would V”

be a little above that. . .
I ﬁled this memorandum and thought that I
would disregard it,’ but then Glasso aroused my

, curiosity. And it was Dr. Sebastian himself, who_

alibied that, “They came to me because they were
poor students and they wanted me to help them
get into Dental School.” _ ' V
C Average Needed I ’ _

Standing in the hallway away from the ears‘ of

the jury, Dr.‘ Sebastian, a plump look—alike for.

Danny ‘Thomas, remarked, “There was nothing
wrong about their getting into Dental School. You
only have to maintain a C average, and be credited
with certain courses like physics. Theygive you

0 “tests, too.”

In another corner of the corridor,'the tanned
attorney continued privately on his thesis, “I think
that the University pushed them through to avoid
embarrassment. They always did favor athletes at
Pitt. Why I remember when I went there. That
(Lou) Skladany and (Marshall) Goldberg both
never were in classes 90% of the time, and still they
were given good grades for playing football.” The
two attacked by Glasso were both All-Americans.

about trying to get__into,_Dental School. 7He’s main- 0

balance of power in Southeast Asia. Laos and
South Vietnam are in Communist China’s backyard,
The Chinese have apractically unlimited Supply
of,‘ manpower to send across their common border
with Laos or through North Vietnam into this area.

The terrain is also -unsuitable for any largei

scale military action. The area is infested with
jungle, and V a monsoon season makes military
battles as we know them impossible: for a good
manymonths of the year. A

oA1so, the mood of/the American people at the
present time is not ready for another Korea, or
what might prove to be worse. They would stand

‘ for no less than a decisive war; And Laos is no
‘place to ﬁght a decisive war. After a few months of

American military action in Laos, such a‘ venture
would be thoroughly censured» by.‘ the American
people, and all (traces of bi-partisan unity would be
lost, as they were lost in the months following the

* outbreak of.the Korean War.

_ The third, alternative I would suggest is for us

to adopt the same methods that the communists are.

using. The ﬁrst thing for us to do would be to set

up truly_democratic states in such areas as South 7

Vie_tnamV§_and_ assure popular jsupport,for.. ‘any West-

. ernu oriented ‘government, for~no guerilla actions can i
be successful without the support of_ the local_pop- ‘

u1ace.- Then we would have to ‘train guerillas and
infiltrate them into the, communist held areas. If
this were done in an effective enough "manner, we
could cause‘ the communists unmeasurable amounts
of troublein these areas.‘ But, unfortunately, this
third alternative, although -they most desirable one,

/takes time, and time, to use an old cliche, is not

on our side.  ﬂ , ,» A .

The situationjis certainly a gloomy one, and if
we’ do not'have the time to pursue the third alter-
native I have suggested, then our only move could
be direct_ military intervention, knowing full well
the consequences that eould arise from it.

claim that “when Tom ‘Hamilton was the Athletic

Director, he had a great inﬂuence ‘on the Dental.

School. If he recommended  kid, well ... . "I don’t

During a phone conversation, present AD Frank

, Carver balked," “That’s not true I don’t know of a

single person who ever got in because of us. In
fact, an athletic background may actually hinder

o a boy.” , - . -

“As far as those two boys are concerned, we

were quite surprised that’ they were accepted as 

juniors. Wepwerei amazed because we expected
them to make it as seniors. But we were never
even approached for a recommendation in their

case.”

“It's better for us if they don’t,g'_et in till later,”
Carver-,mentione'd,__ ‘_‘because they 'missed a lot of
practicgebecause of classes and the extra burden of

studies.”

Decrease in Applicants .
Well-then, exactly how did Fridleyand Falen-
ski get into'Dental School? Aside from ‘the fact
that 10 years ago the school received 6,000 appli-
cations for 83 places, and there were only 250 for
95 places 1aSt.year, Dr. William Swanson, Dean of
the Dental School gave the following information:

“They‘both scored in the top half of those who

were accepted on-the American Dental Aptitude"

“It was very encouraging to see
these two throw well,” Lewis re-

they’ll come around now.”

The victory was the Cat’s third

Golfers Lose 2 Meets

The Panther golf team traveled
to Navy on Wednesday with only
a slight chance of winning, it was
not a surprise when they absorbed
a loss. But when they came back
it was unexpected that they would
have an additional two losses on
their record.

What happened was that Navy
invited Duke to replay an earlier
rain—out on the day the Panthers
were to come. In the spirit of the
game the Cats decidedpto pit their
scores against Duke’s also.

They came out second best in
both encounters, losing to Duke,
6-1 and Navy, 5-2. Duke is an-
nually one of the countries better
golf teams and Navy ‘is always
tough‘ on their home course.

Panther trackmen turned in the
best performances Saturday
against Penn State, but the Lions
had too much depth and easily
knocked oﬁ Pitt 84% to 461/3.

The loss, the fourth for the Pan-
thers in five starts, was expected.
Nevertheless, several of the Pan-
thers surprised State by turning in
their best efforts this season. “We
do have several good perform-
ers,” Coach Carl Rees said. “What
we need now is enough of them to
compete with other big teams.”

State might have turned in a

bigger score had they the mind to,

for their sprinter, Bob Brown, had
to miss the meet due to illness in
his family. The Lions also limited
the number of men they put in
several races.

It was apparent from the be-
ginning of the meet that State
had the big punch, for in the
first race, the mile, Steve Moor-
head won it in 4:09.8 to set a
Pitt Stadium record. They swept
the event.

Pitt's tennis team will try to

‘Wednesday after absorbing their
second loss of the season at Navy.

The Middies duplicated their
feat of last year by posting an 8-1
win over the Cats. Gaining the
lone triumph for the Panthers was
unbeaten Jack Douglas. “Jack the
Gian’; Killer,” as Coach Bill Sum-
mers calls him,’ scoored a 6-3,
1-6, 9-7, win over ‘Rick Fluegel.

The winboosted the Panthers’

number three man’s record to a

sparkling 7-0.~ Douglas h as

achieved this ﬁne mark despite

being hampered with a bad
back, that caused him to miss
the Penn State match.

In doubles play Douglas’s back
was bothering him quite a bit, but
it is doubtful that even it he were

physically sound anything could .

have helped him and his partner,
Joe Brown, from taking their first
loss of the season, 6-1, 6-0.

Joe Brown, Paul Kochman and
Roger Glaser continued to mirror

records, same as the team and all

Whitman Reviews 2 Bdway Hits

By MATTHEW NE SVISKY

Modern drama was given a
modern analysis by Professor Ro-
bert F. Whitman in the Pitt Book
Center’s review’ series on Wed-
nesday, Mya 10. Two current
Broadway hits, “Beckett” by Jean
Anouilh and “Rhinoceros” by Eu-
gene Ionesco, were the subjects

of the Professor’s diagnosis.

Early in his 45 minut_e lecture,
Whitman, who studied at Cornell
and Harvard before joining the
University faculty, stated flatly
that he felt (“Rhinoceros was the
better play. It is simple, direct, ef-

fective.” ‘The Anouilh work, he
' said,‘ was
.plex ideas, none of which are
A )fully"_ developed.” A

”burdoned with com-

Whitman, ,ﬁrst discussed the

.,,'differences and similarities in the
--productions. Both plays are writ-
' rtentby foreigners, he pointed out,

and both are broadway hits. Both
are examples of avant-garde writ-

 ing, but “Beckett,” a tragedy, is
7-concerned withcharacters, while

“Rhinoceros,” an u p r o a r i o u s
*-farce, is centered around the most
crucial ideals of our lives. w

1  ,The review was neatly divid-

ed into two sections, one for

each play, and was then fol-

‘lowedrby a brief question-and-

answer period which, obviously

much to the speaker’s pleasure,

was almost entirely. concerned ’
with the Ionesco piece.

7  ‘3Beckett" was summed up as a

character study, in which plot was

‘not imparted. Two views of the
world were revealed through the

two main characters: the King,
Henry II, who lives for the poli-
tical kingdoms of earth and Beck-

 ett, who lives for the Kingdom of

God. The latter, as Archbishop of
Canterbury does not, however‘,

represent all clergy.

Eliotfs “Murder in the Cathe-
dral,” Whitman concluded. was a

as ' '
“much more worth-while piece of cause “it happens to everybody.”

drama.”

The “Rhino” production was
then reviewed. “A political and
social -message,” Whitman be-
gan. The play is a study in con-
formity, and is highlighted by
the people who turn into beasts
praising the transformation be-

The point of the play was to
motivate the audience t-o question
its individual set of values. Whit-
man added that, although it was
Ionesco, and not Anouilh, who
reached out to the public, “Ion—
esco has not made a rhinoceros of
himself.”
