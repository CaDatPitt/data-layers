Students   Re-enact

Grenada Invasion

By MARTY WILLIS

A group of about I0 “interna-
tional island liberators,” includ-
ing five‘ Pitt students, yesterday
staged a mock “invasion” of the
traffic island at Forbes Avenue
and Bigelow Boulevard, directly
across from Hiilman Library.

Wearing green army fatigues,
the group “moved in” through
the rain, shouting comical ver-
sions of military chants. In true
street theatre style, the group
proceeded to parody the U.S.
invasion of Grenada by “mop-
ping up" the traffic island with
wooden mops and’ distributing
about 100 bananas to passersby
as a symbol of the “fruits of war.”

“In a playful way, we wanted
to make people aware of some of
the absurdities in United States
policy and challenge the apathy

of the American public and also '

of Pitt students at this point in
time,“ Cindy Visnich, a Pitt
graduate student, said yesterday
after participating in the action.
“What we are concerned about
is, one, the invasion itself and,
two, how quickly everyone for-
got about what happened and
how soon the story slipped to the

back pages of the newspapers,”
she said.

The group exhorted the lunch-
time rush of onlookers to join in
the invasion, passing out ﬂyers
that read: “There is undeniable
proof that the traffic island on
the corner of Forbes and Bigelow
is a bastion of Communist
expansion. We must stop ‘this
advance. Join us in this patriotic
effort!” , ,

The ad hoc group released a
press -statement on Monday that
explained in advance the “ration-
ale" for the action: “We want to
liberate imprisoned Americans
and cease construction of a
Commie-Ruskie airstrip on that
traffic island. We want to ensure

‘democracy for all Pitt engineer-

ing students.”

Visnich contrasted the goals
and approach of the group to
those of many left-wing political

organizations, whose hard-line, '

sometimes overbearing style she
termed “boring, too.”

“We’re. not Marxists, you
know, and we’re not intellectu-
als. We're not affiliated with any
political party. We'rejust people
who are concerned about this
issue."

Dean Demands Resignation,
Claims Assistant Disloyai

By PEGGY FERRI -

A Pitt dean’s demand for a staff
member’s resignation has triggered a
war of words with the staffer’s label-
ling as'“poppycock” charges that he
is driving a wedge between the medi-
cal school and Oakland hospitals
staffed by Pitt faculty. _ j

Dr. Donald Leon called for the
resignation of ‘Dr. Robert E. Olson,
assistant dean for academic affairs,

~ on Friday, citing whatlhe termed

Olson’s “disruptive philosophy of
management.” ‘

Leon said he began to question
Olson’s loyalty to the school,
although he admitted Olson has-
accomplished much in the basic
sciences during his term as assistant
dean. -‘

V physicians or those involved_in clini-
cal work who use university facilities

Olson said he was astonished ~

when he received the request for his
resignation.

“I believe the fundamental reason
[for the resignation request] was a
change in emphasis at the university
away from the basic sciences,” Olson

said. “lt’s a question of priorities. .

[Dr. Robert] Glew’s point is a little
exaggerated.” Olson was referring to
Monday’s issue of The Pitt News,
where Glew attributed Leon’s
request for Olson’s resignation to

Pitt Plann

By NANCY POPKIN

The research team from Pitt’s
Graduate School of Public Health
formed to study Acquired Immune
Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS),hopes
to begin its study by February.

Pitt was one of five universities
contracted by the National Health
Institute (NHI) to conduct research
over the next four years that the
medical community hopes will lead
to finding both the cause of and a
cure for AIDS. ,

The research team, headed by Dr.
Charles Rinaldo, will receive yearly
allotments from the $4.36 million
contract.

The group will begin its research
by determining the lifestyles of 7,000
to 10,000 gay male volunteers
through questionnaires and by tak-
ing blood samples, which will be
kept in a bank for future use. ~

David Lyter, a fourth-year medi-
cal student and member of the
research team, said} that the questi-
onnaires will determine how many

Olson’s actions to challenge the uni-.

versity’s practice plans.

“Clinical areas _have a lot of auto-
nomy,” Olso-n said, “and the percen-
tage [of money] they contribute to
the university is very small. It should
be increased.”

a Practice plans require that a cer-

should be funneled back into the
operating budget of the university.
Leon called the claim that practice
plans played a part in his decision to
demand Olson’s resignation a “sup-
position” which ‘has no factual basis.

Olson was appointed torevitalize
the basic sciences departments,
which. include biochemistry, micro-
biology, cell_ biology, anatomy and
pharmacology. Those departments
were in astate of decline, but in his
14 months as assistant, Olson has
recruited many faculty members and
chairmen.and secured $2 million in

A funds from Sen. John Heinz.

_of the volunteers have had hepatitis
‘ 'or venereal‘ disease and will help‘to “

Leon said Pitt receives more
money from clinical departments
than most schools and it would be
“unreasonable” to ask for more than
the university is already getting. He
refused to disclose any exactifigures,

saying that he considered them
“confidential in nature.”

Olson argued that the amount Pitt
receives is well under what it should‘
be. He said he told a recent Liaison
Committee on Medical Education
task force, sent to the university for
accreditation purposes, that the

basic sciences have made a_ good  '

start but are in ‘need -"of more
resources. _ .

According to Olson’, Leorl sug-
gested taxing the practice plans to
obtain more revenue for the school
but never followed through on this.
Leon admitted he had made‘ the sug-
gestion but also called it “counter-
productive” and emphasized there
are other ways to get money he
wants that should be explored
instead. - ‘

Leon said if Olson does not resign,_
there are two options: wait until
Olson turns 65 in January and
retires or sign the termination pap-
ers, which in effect fires him.

“If the priority at Pitt has

_ changed, as I believe it has,” Olson

explained, “then there is norole for
me here.” "

‘ He said he will remaina member
of the faculty even if he does elect to.
resign his position as assistant dean.

ng AIDS Research 

characterize
Pittsburgh.
This is an important factor in the
study because the number ofcases of
sexually _transmitted diseases is

gay lifestyles in

directly related to the number of-

cases of AIDS. The incidence of
AIDS in Pittsburgh has been rela-
tively low compared to other cities,
and out of 63 cities over the size of
200,000 people, Pittsburgh rates 62
in the incidence of syphilis.

Researchers are hypothesizing
that AIDS may be-linked to the
hepatitis-B virus, a sexually
acquired infection.

The hypothesis that AIDS is‘

linked with Haiti has been discarded
by Rinaldo and Lyter. They believe
that the disease is linked to Africa,
where it has been present for a long
time. .

From now until February, the
Pittsburgh research team and the
four other contracted universities
will be negotiating the specifics of a
second study group of 2,000. The
members of this group will be picked
according to whether they identified
themselves as having any one of the

seven warning-‘ sig«nal's5of ~AID'S ‘-

swollen glands, discolored bumps,
weight loss, fatigue, fevers or night
sweating, heavy or dry cough or per
sistent diarrhea. -

The study will take 21/; years and
all of the results will be sent to NH_I
for evaluation.

A third study group will be made
up of volunteers with AIDS Related
Complex (ARC). An ARC patient
has one of the warning signs but no
outbreak of a disease or infection
that may accompany AIDS. I

Rinaldo stresses the confidential-
ity of the research. Names of volun-

* teers will not be given out — under
_ any circumstances. He said-that even

if a genuinely concerned person, a
lover or a family member of a volun-
teer, wanted to know if a volunteer
had AIDS, ‘he wouldn’t disclose

. information. He wouldn’t even con-

firm that the person in question was
participating in the study.
Clinic sites will also be set up

_discreetly, “so there won’t be any

fear of people walking through a
door,” Lyter said.

burgh and the other four universities

A Life" Flight "  

Responding To Emergencies

By JOHN GAMBESCIA

The idea of an emergency medical
service by helicopter has been ques-
tioned by many health-related pro-
fessionals, but"it makes a difference
when seconds count, registered
nurse Sandy Schoppert said.

Schoppert, coordinator of the
Life Flight Outreach Program,
spoke Monday at a presentation on
Allegheny General Hospital’s air-
borne emergency medicalservice.

Life Flight is made up of a group
of experienced emergency nurse
practioners, qualiﬁed to administer
advanced. life support techniques.
Included in their equipment is 250
lbs. of sophisticated emergency

lequipment carried by two jet

powered helicopters and a fixed-
wing twin engine aircraft.

“Our crew is ready to ‘respond
within three to five minutes to any
call’ that meets the ‘critical’ stand-
ards set down by the service,”
Schoppert said. “We will not
respond to a call that can be handled
by ground service. It would defeat

our purpose and add unnecessary
costs to the natient."

Schoppert said there are three fac-
tors to keep in mind before deciding
to contact Life Flight. First, .it is
important to consider the time ele-
ment — would the use of the service
have a direct impact on the patients
survival or recovery? Second, road
and weather conditions must be con-
sidered — would the use of ground
transportation delay the patient’s
access to medical treatment? Third,
the use of acute medical treatment

—— could care be provided for the -

patient by basic ambulance service?
Life'Flight is currently in its fifth
year of operation and averages 175
flights each month. It is accessible 24
hours a day, seven days a week and
covers a 130-mile radius with
Allegheny Hospital as its base
station. ,
“Besides responding to only acci-
dents, we also do extensive hospital-
to-hospital transfers," Schoppert
said. “Frequently, patients recog-
nized as potential donors are trans-
ferred to a trauma center for special

medical treatment,” she said. “With-
out the speed and efficiency of Life

Flight, we m_ight not have the_
number of available_donor- organs ‘

that we have today.”

-Each -patient is evaluated on an
individual basis, using the five cri-
teria that Life Flight_personnel con-

sider important enough to make an »

emergency flight. They include
trauma, head and spinal cord
trauma, burns, acute medical and
surgical disorders and high-risk
pregnancies.

Life Flight can be activated by
physicians, nurses, paramedics or
police and fire officials. Contact can
be made by calling Allegheny Gen-
eral Hospital’s operations center or
by tuning into the Hear system radio
frequencies. _ .

“It makes a difference when

Pitt Plans ;
Research

continued from page one

contracted by NHI are gathering
data from humans, other universi-
ties are using monkeys bred in cap-
tivity to test for agents of AIDS.

Monkeys are being used because
they are the closest 'animal to
humans. In addition, an AIDS-like

syndrome has been found in mon- V

keys in Massachusetts and Califor-
nia, Rinaldo said.

It is not known why AIDS is more
prevalent among homosexual men
than in the population as a whole. It
has caused a panic among gays,
especially those who are sexually
promiscuous, and the heterosexual
community.

Lyter said that there has been a
tremendous’ decline in blood dona-
tions because people are afraid

they’l1 contract AIDS from the hy- ,
.podermic needle.

The Pittsburgh Central Blood
bank has published a flyer asking
people who feel they may be at risk
of having AIDS notto donate. And
if they feel they must donate, the
banks have included a» number to
call within four hours of the dona-
tion so the bank can pull the dona-
tion. They have beeniusing the ﬂyer
since May and have gotten no calls.

The gay community is working’

closely with the research team. The
Pittsburgh Tavern Guild, an organi-
zation of gay bars and restaurants,
held a week of fund-raising for the
project, and the bartenders are help-
ing to recruit volunteers for the
study.

The Gay Community Center and

- Persad — Pittsburgh’s counseling,

educational and research agency for
sexual minorities — have also been
helpful in publicizing the project,
Lyter said. They have already
received calls from over 300 men
who want to volunteer.

Lyter hopes that once the study
gets underway, a support group will
be established in Pittsburgh so that
AIDS victims can help each other.

Lyter said that a lot ofvictims and
gay men alike feel guilty for their
sexual behavior. And many hetero-
sexuals believe that gays are getting
what they deserve for their lifestyle.

“That’s like saying that a [hetero-
sexual] deserves cancer,” one gay
man said.

Monopoly
On Truth

There is a dangerous precedent about to be set if
, Metromedia Inc. has its way with the Federal Com-
munications Commission (FCC). ‘

There is currently an FCC ruling that limits the
number of TV and radio stations one company may
own. The so-called “7-7-7” law, established 30 years.
ago, allows ownership of seven of AM and FM radio
stations each and seven television stations by any one
company. Metromedia is one of few companies that
owns the maximum number of stations, and it is using
all the power it can muster to change the law. The FCC
has enacted a public comment period, ending in
December.

The FCC is a panel appointed by the president, and
it owes no allegiance to the public, so this ruling would
be just another example of Reagan’s myopic policy
decisions.

Reagan has never pretended" to allow what’s good
for the majority to interfere with what is good for his
corporate cronies who put him in office. The FCC,
under Reagan, is becoming to the airwaves what

' James Watt was to the air. ,

The Reagan administration — from inauguration.
day —- has\catered to the interests of large corpora-
tions. If the FCC allows the wealthiest companies in
America to buy up all the news services, freedom of the

‘ press will become a fairy tale about which well read to
our children at night. .

This ruling would place the ominous power of
deciding what are to be “facts” and what is news
worthy into the hands of people whose primary motive
is profit. _

Even if a maximum of five or six companies took
initial control of the airwaves, most independent
broadcast stations would be forced out of business
through a loss of advertising. Economically risky pro-
gressive radio and TV shows would probably be too
speculative to invest in and could soon disappear from

. the media.

This type of profit taking can already be seen in
Hollywood, where companies such as Gulf and West-
ern Industries Inc. (which owns Paramount Studios)
and Coca-Cola (which owns Columbia Pictures) have
bought up the movie industry, resulting in the recent
ﬂood of low-quality ﬁlms.

When it comes to news and information, corporate
control paints an even more gloomy picture. This
scenario parallels the acceptance of the fictitious
attack in the Gulf of Tonkin that resulted in Congress’

_ allowing Lyndon Johnson unquestioned warpowers in
the Vietnam War. Events like this are the consequence
of leaving the public at the mercy of corporations with ‘
a monopoly on “truth”

Disguising Anti—|srae| Vitroil

Dear Editor: '

Dana Reed has sought to disguise
his anti-Israel vitroil in the Oct. 26
issue of ‘The Pitt News as a reply to
my letter to the editor. I use the word
disguise for he has chosen to totally
ignore the main issue of the letter
and, in so doing, is guilty ofthe most
abhorrent form of the hypocracy
decried in my letter.

Many hundreds of civilians have
been massacred in Lebanon during

the past few months. The silence sur-"

rounding these massacres has been
deafening. Those who had organ-
ized the street demonstrations at the

. time of the Sabra and Shatilla mas-

sacres have remained silent concern-
ing the massacres ofChristians prior
to lsrael’s invasion of Lebanon. The
only conclusion that I can draw
from this is that the tragedy of Sabra
and Shatilla goes" deeper than the
deaths alone. The tragedy also
includes the selective “humanitar-
ianism” and the selective “moral
outrage” of those who spoke up
then, when they perceived Israeli
involvement, yet remain silent now.
In my letter, I condemned all of
the senseless massacres that have
occurred throughout Lebanon's
short and bloody existence. The fact
that Dana Reed will not join me in
this condemnation stands as a gro-
tesque monument to the single-
mindedness of his school of critics of
Israel. The fact that Mr. Reed
chooses to bury the news of the
recent massacres of non-
Palestinians in Lebanon by seeking
to focus our attention elsewhere is
an insidious example of the desecra-
tion ofthe memory ofthose civilians
murdered at Sabra and Shatilla
upon which I focused in my letter.
Are the murders of non-
Palestinians of so little consequence
to Mr. Reed and his ilk thatthey can
not find it in their hearts to condemn
them?! Can it be that Dana Reed" will
only condemn “brutal Massacres”
when he feels that there is some
Israeli involvement?! One can draw

no other conclusion from Dana
Reed’s letter.

I stand accused of being an apolo-
gist for Israel. Mr. Reed makes a
grave error when he seeks to label
pride as apology. I am not ashamed
nor do I apologize for being aJew or

a Zionist. As a Jew, I take great-

pride in my people, my culture and
my state. _
Zionism is the national liberation

i movement of the Jewish people. I‘

need not apologize for believing in
the legitimate rights of the Jewish
people to their own homeland. The
apology must come from those who

seek to deny us that right. I need not

apologize for what Israel must do to
defend herself. The apology must
come from those who seek to des-
troy us. I need not apologize for the
unrest in the Middle East. The apol-
ogy must come from the Arab states
who, for 35 years, have refused to
recognize lsrael’s existence, let alone
sit down and discuss peace.

I need not apologize for lsrael’s
arms deals. The apology must come
from those who view these from a
double standard — one for Israel
and one for the rest of the world.

The Kahan investigation stands as
a testament to the strength of Israeli
democracy. I take great pride in the
fact that Israel held such an investi-
gation. If any apologies are to be
made, they should come from
Lebanon for the shame of an investi-
gation that they conducted.

Dana Reed’s accusation that I am
spreading misinformation and dis-
torting the truth is evidently based
soley on the fact that I did not write
what he wanted to read, for the facts
are clear to anyone who seeks to
investigate them. ,

Mr. Reed and I are all too familiar
with each other’s positions. Dana
Reed and I have exchanged our
views concerning the Middle East
situation many times on the opinion
pages of this newspaper. At times,
the incongruity of his views and the
truth has amazed me; at times, this
has amused me.

I was amused to read that the,

P.L.O. — a terrorist organization of
many factions who settle internal
disputes by assassination or, as we
have seen in Lebanon, by inter-
necine war —— is, in Dana Reed’s
words, “probably as democratic an
organization as Israel could hope to
be.” If Mr. Reed truly believes this,
he has my sympathy. In all fairness
to Dana Reed, I must point out that
he does caution his readers that this
is “not common knowledge.”

I was caught between amusement
and amazement when Mr. Reed
accused Israel of the greatest sin
imaginable (at least in Moscow’s
eyes): that of being an ally of the
United States or, in his words, “a
surrogate of the U.S." But, not to
worry, Mr. Reed reminds us that
“the Israelis are a moral people,” so,
hopefully, they will recognize this
“grave error.”

Lastly, Dana Reed has amazed
me. He has publicly taken offense at
my labelling as anti-Semitic the
statement “No people's God would
sanctify the Jews’ will towards
excessive wealth and profit" that
was made by a member of his organ-
ization in the pages of this paper.
Evidently, this is either the truth in
his mind or at least acceptable since
it was said as part of a letter criticiz-
ing Israel.

In light of our past exchanges, I
should not be surprised, I suppose,
by Dana Reed’s attempt to bury the
news of the recent massacres of non-
Palestinians in Lebanon, let alone
his failure tojoin me in condemning
them.

In closing, Icaution Mr. Reed not
to attempt to label my support for
Israel or, for that matter, the world
Jewish community's support for
Israel as apologistic. The time has
past when Jews were expected to
apologize for their existence or for
taking whatever measures are neces-
sary to defend themselves.

According to ‘Bob Robinson,

versity‘s waiting list. Two weeks
prior to the beginning of school,
I was informed by the housing
office receptionist that I would
be housed within the remai‘ifi‘ng
two weeks, without any
problems. '

On Monday, Aug. 29, two
days before classes started, I was
informed that I would not
receive housing until the winter
term. I also inquired about the
number of students given hous-
ing during the two weeks. No
additional students had received
housing. To this date, the univer-
sity has yet to provide housing

been on the waiting list since the
lottery.

I believe more accurate infor-
mation needs to be provided for
the students waiting for housing
so there is sufficient time for
them to find alternative forms of
housing. However, this informa-
tion is not made readily available
to the students. When available,
it is frequently inaccurate and
therefore forces many students
to commute or seek alternate
housing_ in an insufficient

. amount of time.

Satirical Gra

d Column

Brings Repercussions

By CHRIS sosso

Al never bothered to knock when
he wanted to talk. This time he
almost tore the door off its hinges as
he barged into my office. I looked up
from my book on politics in Altoona
only when the ashes "from his
cigarette began to burn holes in page
326.

“Now you’ve done it, Bosso,” Al
snarled. “How could you?”

“How could I what?” I asked
innocently, though I vaguely sus-
pected what was on his mind.

“You and your damned satire on
he answered,
grinding his cigarette butt into my
desk blotter. “All of my students
now think that I hate them. They
read your piece ofjournalistic doo-
doo and then accuse me ofacademic
pretentiousness and intellectual
snobbery.”

“Now wait a second, Al,” I pro-
tested. “That was a harmless spoof.
Besides, I doubt if anybody could
accuse you of intellectual snobbery.
You hate intellectuals. How could
anyone who memorizes old ‘Leave it
to Beaver’ routines be academically
pretentious?”

“Don't change the subject,” he
yelled. I hadn't seen him this per-
turbed since the Pirates dropped a
doubleheader to the Phillies.
“You’re the one who hates under-
graduates, not me. I want you to
write a public apology.”

“A whatl?"

“An apology. You started this
mess; you end it. You owe that much
to us grad students.”

“The hell I do," I snorted. “My
students know that I respect them.
Well, at least most of them. So don’t
blame me for your problems.
Besides, why would I spend six years
in grad school, with every intention
of teaching as a career, if I hated
students?”

“Because you like the money,” he
replied lamely.

“Tell me another story, daddy.”

“OK, so it isn‘t the money. You
know why you do this? Because you
can’t do anything else, that’s why.
You could have been something — a
lawyer or a doctor. Instead, you're
nothing, a bum.”

“What does that make you?"

“Don’t change the subject on me.
Its your attitude we’re talking
about. My students were perfectly
content until that column. Now they
bitch up and down about book pri-

‘ces, lectures and the exams. Hell,

they don’t even laugh at my joke
anymore." _

“Al,” I said, “nobody does."

Before he could reply, four more
grad students stormed into the
office, the strong odor of tar and
feathers trailing like skunk musk.
I‘ve since left school and joined the
Marines. Academic-life is just too
dangerous.

Soviet InterventionLimited

Dear Editor:

That Mr. Mallin’s letter to the edi-
tor, Nov. 9, supports the invasion of
Grenada is not as objectionable as is
the premise on which he bases his
case, namely, that the U.S. must
react against “world communist”
threats in Central America.

Like Lazarus rising from the
dead, “monolithic communism” is
resurrected in Mr. Mallin's scheme.
With a disturbing lack of percep-
tion, he carelessly lumps the diverse
foreign policies of such governments
as Yugoslavia, Rumania and the
People’s Republic of China into a
solid communist “whole. ” He conve-
niently overlooks Chinese condem-
nation of the Soviet invasion of
Afghanistan and the lack of enthusi-
asm shown among many East Euro-
pean regimes for this operation.

Mr. Mallin greatly overstates his
case concerning Soviet involvement
in Central America. Mr. Mallin
ignores the fact that the actual
Soviet activity has been quite cau-
tious and limited to small amounts
of economic assistance (i.e., Nicara-
gua). Given this country‘s severe
economic problems, the Nicaraguan
government has been forced to seek
aid somewhere, and the Soviet
Union is a likely alternative when
the U.S. refuses to grant such aid.
However, one must remember that
the Sandinistas receive the bulk of

its economic" assistance from the
West European nations and not
from the communist bloc.

For a number of reasons, Central
America is not a primary base of

‘Soviet operations". The U.S.S.R.
already must support the Cuban
economy to the tune of $l0 billion
per year. Given the fact that the
Soviet economy has its own severe
constraints and must maintain large
deployments of troops in Eastern
Europe, Afghanistan and along the
Chinese border, it can hardly afford
to prop up other revolutionary
governments in the Central Ameri-
can region.

Moreover, there is an enormous
asymmetry in military posture in
this region. Soviet forces stationed
in Cuba perform a deterrence func-
tion against the U.S., but they are
not an offensive threat to American
interests in Central America. Mr.
Mallin should be cognizant of these
facts before he shouts, “the Russians
are coming, the Russians are
coming."

Mr. Mallin urges a short-term
solution to a long-term problem.
Military interventions will not fore-
stall the socio—economic develop-
ments that are taking place in
Central America. The situation in
Grenada is somewhat of an excep-
tion from what existsin most of the
countries in this region. The danger
lies in a tendency for U.S. policy-

makers to generalize from this suc-

efesful operation, and determine that if I I

t is could apply for other countries
in the region. Nothing could be more
hazardous for the U.S. V.

As Latin America undergoes a-
measure of social and economic
development, demands for political

change will increase. This does not ..

mean that the U.S. should sit on its
hands while Marxist-Leninists take
power. Instead, the U.S. can effec-
tively promote democracy in such
threatened countries by supporting, -
in the early stages, the broad base of
democratic elements within the
opposition movements. Support of
moderate socialist and/or demo-
cratic parties will reduce the power
of the extreme Left. But this must
occur before the moderate elements
are forced, as a result of hostile, anti-
democratic practices of the U.S.-
supported military juntas, into the
extremist camp.

But if the U.S. (and Mr. Mallin)
continue to view Latin America
through their one-dimensional lens,
we will lose many opportunities to
diffuse Cuban influence and more
“losses” are sure to follow. In short,
its past time for the “monolithic

communist” view to be tossed back . I

into the dust-bin of history.

Coming-from high school to col-

from it -for several years. However,

According to Dr. Robert Comfort

of the College of General Studies
(CGS), themedianage of students at
Pitt‘is 28, but extremities of age can

‘I go from 16 to 65.

Reasons‘ why individuals of this
“non-traditional” nature decide to

I attend school vary, the biggest of

which, Comfort said, is profession-
alism in the working world. Individ-
uals who are already working and do
not have a degree see an education as
making them more attractive to
prospective employers.
For the 30 percent of the students
.who returned to Pitt after already
receiving a degree, another college
degree often helps in job mobility

and in making one a more valuable '

asset to an employer._

Although the benefits of a ‘college
education are numerous, there are
problems that creep up when older
students return to the classroom.

dents encounter is that there is rarely
a peer relationship that develops
between older and younger students
in the classroom.

When students see older students
in-their classes, they often become
quiet because they don’t know what
to say.

According to Larry Pollick, a 37-
year-old employee of Filmet Color
Laboratories who returned to
school for his Bachelor of Arts
degree, older/ younger student com-
munications hasn’t been a problem
for him. ’

“l’ve been in classrooms where we
had a fellow who was 72 years old,”
Pollick said. “There wasn’t any
problem.” '

Adjustment is another problem
that older students face. Getting into
the routine of taking tests, writing
papers and doing math problems
they haven’t encountered since high
school are pressures. that are some-
times hard to handle.

Additionally, many of these stu-
ents must juggle a husband or wife,
children’, housework and a job ——
and still find time to study.

Pollick is fortunate in that his wife
is 2 f’ rmer CGS stuéirent and is “tol-

\‘\‘

     
    

 

erant of all the hours I put into
school."

He has been taking two classes per
term for the past eight years and is
finally nearing his goal; he will grad-
uate this December with a degree in
speech and communications.

He said he is cheating his 2'/2-year-
old son to a certain point but will
make it up to him once he has his
degree. -

Having a young class professor is
another problem older students
must deal with. Sometimes, Aurand
said, the teacher is young enough to
be the students’ son or daughter.

On the other end of the continu-
um is the 60-year-old who knows so
much that relating his knowledge to
the class is sometimes a hard task.

year—olds can be a humiliating expe-
rience for older students, too.

One group designed specifically to
deal with these and other problems
of the older student is the Academic
Bag Ladies, in which women in their
30s and older get together over lunch
and discuss both positive and nega-
tive classroom encounters.

“To be able to sit down and relax
with women that are your own age is
a big boost,” Aurand said.

The group began last fall to
address the need for women to be
with other women who are in the
same situation. Some of the things
discussed during lunch are very like
those younger students discuss —
which course is a good one, if work-
shops can help with writing a paper.

Younger students often have trou-
ble balancing school and extra-
curricular activities, so maybe a
lesson can be learned from those
whose “homework” includes house-
work and managing a spouse and
children in addition to their college
studies. -

s Students Benefit From Interaction

by

By RON SMUTNY

More Pitt students are learning to
appreciate cultural variety by join-
ing the Intercultural House, located
on North Dithridgei Street in
Oakland.

Twice as many foreign students
live at the house than did when it
opened 13 years ago, according to

' resident director Ann Shields.

The house was designed to be a
place for black and white students to
interact,,Shields said. It was opened
in I970 by the Gertrude Stein Foun-
dation as a means of bringing cultu-
rally different students together.
Because foreign student applicants
far outnumber American ones,
Shields said the house’s profile has
shifted to the international sector.

“Having international students
here is a real healthy mirror for the
American students,” she said.
Shields added she and otherpersons
involved in operating the facility are
aiming to encourage more American
students to apply for residence.

The. Intercultural House now has

fewer formal connections with the ’
‘university, Shields said. This is

because formerly all student resi-
dents were on full scholarships or
wereinvolved in various accredited
programs. '

Now, since many of these formal
ties were dropped, Shields said she
believes that much greater equality
has been established at the house.

The house is always striving to
promote good relations between
members of all cultures, Shields
explained. The house staff is work-
ing toward this goal by sponsoring
lectures on issues relevant to stu-
dents in this mixed-culture situa-
tion. Past speakers have included

‘There is a real
need for black and
white- interaction
and the Intercultu-
"ral House provides p
that.’ "

-Brenda Smith
' 
Pitt sociology professor Rollo
Turner, who spoke on blacks and
whites together, and Pitt black stu-
dies professor Richard Blackett,

who discussed racial affairs and how
they affect students

The house and its programs are
very important because there are not
many blacks at Pitt who are doing
things for the university, according
to Shields. She said that most blacks
tend to be automatically set aside
into black affairs groups, as opposed
to areas where they could associate
with whites and others.

Project coordinator Brenda
Smith agreed that the house pro-
vides excellent interaction activities
but said she would like to see some
changes.

“They [foreign students] are there
to provide ourside viewpoints for
American students.” She said she
finds such interaction very valuable
but would like to see the percentage
of foreign students reduced to about
20 percent, the level at which it was
when the facility opened.

’ If 80 percent of the residents were
Americans — half blacks and half

‘ whites —— Smith said the two races

would get more much-needed

exposure.

“There is still a real need for black
and white interaction,” she said,
“and the Intercultural House pro-
vides that.” Smith said she would
“like to see the house play a signifi-

cant role in the ongoing racial issues

on campus.”

Piitt-Penn State:

By MARK A. SINDLER

The 90-year-old record stands at
41-38-3. And Penn State holds the
advantage, though how slim it may
be.

Yes, that time of year is here,and
only two of three expressions need
be uttered to appreciate and grasp
the robust feeling: Pitt, Penn‘State
or football.

“Penn State is the biggest game in
our life right now,” said tailback Joe
McCall, who will be searching for
his third ' straight 100-yard-plus
rushing performance on Saturday.

And with every meeting (or is it
high-intensity skirmish?) every year
comes talk of revenge of last year’s
loss.

Of last year’s blown assignment.

    

To ensure that the football
game is not affected by darken-
ing skies, kickoff for the Pitt-
Penn State contest is being
moved up to 1 p.m.

The WTAE—televised rivalry
was originally scheduled for 1:30
p.m., but in the interests of not
conflicting with dusk, the start-
irig time will be changed. Provid-
ing the play-by-play on Channel
4 is Bill Hillgrove; former Pitt
linebacker Sal Sunseri will offer
color commentary.

In anticipation of an expected
crowd topping 60,000 on Satur-
day at Pitt Stadium, a Pitt pep
rally will be held in the stadium
on Friday at 4 p.m.

Those fans wishing to attend
the event, to be joined by head
coach Foge Fazio, must enter
Pitt Stadiprr_i througi Gate 3.

    

  

A

Of last year’s blown whistle,
whether rightly or wrongly.

Of last year’s home-field
advantage.

Tangibles in each Pitt-Penn State
gathering can be stacked atop each
other and reach the moon. But it
doesn’t matter which year it is
because there are winners and losers,
and somehow, each side registers its
own reasons for surviving what is
quickly being billed as one ofa kind:
The Pennsylvania Bowl or should
we say, The Fluke Bowl.

This edition, to be published in
Pitt Stadium on Saturday after a 1
p.m. kickoff, already is different
from those in the past. Sure, both
teams are scoring about 25 points a
game, are generating approximately
200 yards rushing a game, are com-
ing along with youthful quarter-
backs and are in the midst of
winning consistently — Pitt (8-2) on
a six-game streak, Penn State (7-4)
grabbing seven of its last eight.

But either school’s national-title
aspirations aren’t susceptible to
deflation this season. The Nittany
Lions have lost several big games to
Nebraska (44-6, before a national
TV audience, no less), Cincinnati (a
14-3 lynching), Iowa (42-34, when
the offensejust couldn’t see the light
at the tunnel’s end) and Boston Col-
lege (27-17, parity has arrived)._

Two wins against Syracuse and
Rutgers were more like escapes from
burning buildings than tramplings
of destitute enemies, each coming by
a weak 11 points.

Meantime, Pitt _followers are
stunned, wide’-eyed because no one
expected eight victories by Nov. 19.
Hotshot -critics had this Panther
chapter turning a 4-7 page. It is a
team not without its problems,
emphasized over past seasons.

Before defusing Army last week,
the Panthers struggled to victory
after surviving last-minute scoring
threats from Navy and Notre Dame.
Seven seconds separated Pitt from
an ugly tie with Syracuse.

Just as 18-year general Joe
Paterno was peltedwith quarter-
backing woes earlier in the year
(using Doug Strang, Dan Lonergan
and freshie John Shaffer at one
point), two-season sergeant Foge
Fazio bore the brunt of backfield
wheel spinning as part of an offense
oftentimes caught in hashmark
potholes. _

Most importantly of all, though, a
relaxed rivalry is starting to take
shape as the Pitt-Penn State tide

   

Never A Fluke Rivalry   .

slowly rumbles to an Oakland
beachhead.

Joe Paterno offered the initial
breaker at last season’s final gather-
ing of the Curbstone Coaches gath-
ering after the Nittany Lions’ 19-10
win at Beaver Stadium.

“You guys aren’t=.going to domi-
nate us and we’re not going to domi-
nate you,” Paterno said of a rivalry
he lets the fans foster. “As soon as
everybody grows up and under-
stands that and looks forward to a
great game and walks off the ﬁeld
saying, ‘That’s a hell of a ballgame
you guys played," all of us will enjoy
it " -

Though he now assumes an easy-
way-out “taken out of context” posi-
tion, Paterno fueled the fire a bit this
year when he called Pitt’s Notre
Dame victory a “ﬂuke" in a game he
said would end differently were it
played again. 7

‘‘That’s the kind of thing [media]
people play upon,” Paterno said.
“They want to /compare people,
things, whatever. I said it might have
been a fluke; I’m not sure. I said

Spikers Gearing
For Second  
Championships

Related Story, Page 11.
By LAURIE KUBLI

Friday, the Pitt women’s volley-
ball team travels to Providence,
R.I., to defend its Big East crown.
According to coach Shelton Collier
it is the beginning of his team's
championship season, the goal being
one step higher than last year’s
achievement.

Last winter Pitt lost in the first
round of the NCAA tournament, a
Big East title their ticket there. Colli-
er’s goal now is to win the first round
and move to the second, a feat plac-
ing Pitt among the nation’s Top 16.

First, however, the Lady Panthers
must successfully hurdle several

teams this weekend. Four teams

with the best records in three games
of round robin play advance to Sun-
day's semifinals.

, Pitt brings to the island state a
27-10 mark, remarkable itself on the
surface. However, numbers tend to
conceal factors indicating the team’s
strengths.

A majority of the -defeats were
dealt by Top 20 programs. Pitt has
only defeated one, Florida State.

Confidently peering beyond the
first three matches, Collier is con-
cerned with a Georgetown meeting
in the semis. A loss there or in the
finals against seeded favorite Provi-
dence ends Pitt’s season.

“We expect to play them in the
final,” Collier said. “I’m concerned

that, with the home-court advan-

tage, Providence will have the
advantage of quite possibly having
officials from the Northeast who
have officiated Providence matches,
but not Pitt’s. '

“Play before the finals should be
academic, as we expect to win. our
matches, and we expect Providence
to win all of theirs. We have a young
team that has suffered some. disap-
pointing losses this year, and I think
the players are hungry to prove

‘themselves. I We look to Providence.

Pitt faces Boston College Satur-

day morning, with Seton Hall and
Villanova following in succession.
Then the semis and doubt.

“Everybody knows how tough it is , ’ I
to win the third match over the same ‘

team,” -Collier said. “The odds "are
against it. We may take Georgetown

blocker Lori Direntiis and junior
outside hitter Tricia O’Brien.
According to Lady Friars’ coach
Dick Bagge, freshman setter Karen
Ferreira “is doing a bang-up job."

“We will have to overcome Pitt’s
aggressive, ball-hawking play,” said
Bagge. “We need to maintain a high
level of intensity and play super
defense. I saw [Pitt] play at Penn
State, and we will definitely need to
play great defense.”

Pitt defeated the Pirates of Seton
Hall (24-24) earlier in the season at
South Orange. Part-time coach
Lucy Ticki has moved the team to a
No. 5 seeding, up from the basement
last year. . ’ i

The Connecticut Lady Huskies,
coached by Avon Abraham, are in
the-lower half of the seedings with a
15-16 mark. They will not meet Pitt
without first upsetting someone on
Saturday. '

Georgetown’s Lady Hoyas lost to
Pitt in last year’s conference cham-

pionship as well as twice this season. ,

The revenge-minded squad is seeded
third with a 16-18 record.

“The question is whether we can
overcome our difficulties, having a
depleted squad,” coach Ken Ng said.

Kohutiak: As

“Middle Hitter,
She’s Undaunted

“By MARK A. SINDLER

She looks over her shoulder, remi-
nisces about initiation rites endured
while a freshman and now just
smirks about the chamber-of-
horrors experiences.

Ulana Kohutiak, a middle hitter
on Pitt’s women’s volleyball squad,
has established herself the last two
and a half years as possibly one of
the East’s top two skilled people at
that position. Getting to this junc-
tion, however, took, in part, survi-
valistic instincts. .

After skipping down the Atlantic

‘ﬁseaboard from Canada a couple

autumns back, Kohutiak envisioned
the usual hard work that would be
necessary to decipher a starting role.
While digging for clues, she soon
found out the muddy soil hurled at
her made for more than an
unhealthy appearance.

Stabs to the back aside, an emo-
tional psyche quickly crumbled.

“I was really depressed during my
freshman year,” Kohutiak
remarked. “I was getting hammered
by my teammates and [Collier].
They singled me out, were crude and
used every possible type of way to
pick on me.”

Begging to differ is Kohutiak’s
coach of three years, Shelton Col-
lier. Differences between him and
her, he will say now, focused on
primarily developing her into the
player she is today. *

“I’m not sure ‘deserve’ is.the word
to describe it,” Collier said, referring
to the “hazing” before entering this
sorority of players. “Someof the
older players were hard on her in a
way they would be since she was
young.

“I did so since I wanted more out
of her. It made her a much better
player. Better and effective.”

Today, it is easy to see why the
team basically lives and dies. bv

Kohutiak. After sustaining torn lig-
aments in an Ohio State match in
I982’s Pitt Classic, Kohutiak grew
accustomed to passive participation
-— cheering from the sideline.

Once the nearly two-month
layover concluded, though, she
rebounded in surprising fashion,
grabbing one of three first team All-
Big East awards awarded the Lady
Panthers in their first championship
_season.

“I was shocked I was even consi-
dered," Kohutiak remarked.

This weekend, similar accolades
will be more difficult to obtain as
Pitt enters the Big East Champion-
ships with a poverty-stricken record
(27-I0) compared with host school
Providence’s (37-9).

Pitt is expected to meet the Lady
Friars in the championship round.

Ulana Kohutlak

“Ulana will receive a majority of
the sets, even more than last year,”
Collier said. '

The emphasis can be attributed to
this being a 1983 squad delinquent
of seniors and undergoing a multiple
youth movement. Kohutiak, ‘one of
four juniors, must now integrate a
leadership variable into her wicked
style of play from the inside.

“Shelton’s philosophy applies to
me and Judy [Young, setter and
team captain]. ‘Whoever has the tal-
ent or the persistence will carry the
team in that area,’ ” she said.

“Just because of this team, I want
to start developing leadership quali-
ties. It’s going to take a strong, over-
confident, powerful feeling."

“Ulana is beginning to understand
this year that she is being relied on
more than ever before," Collier said.
“She has freshmen and sophomores
playing around her and two inexpe-
rienced setters.

‘‘It’s been a quickjump from aux-
iliary player with talented players
[Diane Zack, Julie Gaul, Paula
Olsen] to now, where she is carrying
a bigger load. She's adopted more
responsibilities.”

By reaching this upper echelon,
both Collier and Kohutiak point in
unison to the fateful Summer of '82.
Kohutiak stuck to a weight program
that compensated for an absent
jump capability.’ ‘

Moreover, she trekked across the
country and played in some heavy-
duty tournaments invaluable in her
development. She spent a week in
Knoxville, Tenn., for the United
States Volleyball Association
(USVBA) zonal championships.
Finishing second out of IO there,
Kohutiak’s all-star squad headed

, north for the Ju_nior Olympic cham-

pionships in Chicago.

After finishing part of a second-
place team again there, Kohutiak
then was named the USVBA’s’East-_

'a'».'«.'\.'-."1. s";‘s'v.« 5:»; as t i.'.«. 5 we ‘L0,; an ax’. ‘

The Pitt News, Wednesday, November .I6,_l983.

-Kohutiak Now Undaun ted

ern representative in its national
championships at Santa Barbara.

“At the beginning of the tourna-
ment, Ulana wasn’t playing well and
was benched," said Collier, then an
assistant coach on the squad. “That
upset her. She came back at the end
of the tournament and came back
strong.

“From that, she returned here and
knew that anything she wanted she
would have_to work hard for.”

That squad eventually finished
third, behind UCLA and Santa Bar-
bara. But Kohutiak was just start-
ing, starting to dominate the
opposition with crushing spikes.

“I saw myself as an average player
when I first came here,” she said. “I
developed a lot of strength through
weights, doing sprints and through
hard conditioning. There’s no wayl
was going to be out of shape.”

Collier first noticed Kohutiak
when his Three Rivers Junior Olym-
pic Training Team played against a
Canadian group in summer l98l in
the city. First he sold her on school-
ing in the States, then gave his pitch
on Pitt volleyball.

'- I-6. :4‘? “- ';‘-a’'i '4 ii‘ "5 "4 't_ '5 ‘I ‘A "(‘_"h"i'n '1. Z‘ T‘ i’. |‘- -' -‘

The final sale did not entail nar-
row negotiations or intricate bar-

gaining. Kohutiak is satisfied
enough with the product.
At least that’s what Collier

observes when analyzing his former
prize recruit with Penn State’s mete-
orite hitter, Lori Barbarich, the
East’s other top ball-antagonizer.
“Lori can put the ball on the floor,

but Ulana hits it harder,” he said of .

effectiveness and efficiency —— two
criteria used in judging. “It's like
comparing a singles hitter to a
homerun hitter.”

Contrastingly, -it’s not like com-
paring a freshman to a junior, as
Kohutiak well knows. ‘

EVERYTHING YOU ALWAYS WANTED
IN A BEER. AND l.ESS.

1983.

Pitt-PSU: No

Fluke Here

contmuedfromjaage nine _
Notre Dame and Pitt have skllled
people, and they got ahead ofNotre
Dame 14-0.

“The quarterback [Steve Beuer-
lein] got a little flustered. It was an
unfortunate statement by me and
was meant not to take anything
away from [the Panthers]. It was not
meant in any way to run down the
effort they had.

“They certainly deserved to win
that day.”

Hindsight, as always, butters up
an easily-erasable past. Fazio and
several players brushed the headline
quote away, shagging the obvious:
Pitt won, period.

The matter at hand —— avenging
two straight losses to Penn State —

ohn Madden

will be approached similarly. And
the “fluke" incentive bears unlimited
potential to do so.

“They are a very good team,” Pitt
center Jim Sweeney said, perhaps
oblivious to previous indications.
“They've come a long way since the
beginning and have lost some games
they never should have: Boston Col-
lege, Iowa, Cincinnati. They could
easily have been undefeated."

“We have to be intense, have to
execute and have to force mistakes,”
said McCall, who will be looking for
his third straight I00-yard-plus
rushing performance on Saturday.

“If we do those three things, then
everything will fall into place.”

It seems a bit so simpler, yet more
complex, for Fazio.

“We’ll prepare for them like we
always do,” he said. “We must play
error-free football and be totally
prepared to go after them.”

So the fortitude is, there as Pitt;

starts counting down the hours till
launching a fairly healthy team
against one that rebounded from an
0-3 start.

Maybe the upswings both teams
are enjoying nears the only thing
that makes this upcoming game sim-
ilar, that keeps the rivalry factor,
though subtle, intact.

‘‘I’m really glad where we’re at,"
the Paterno said. “I feel dumb about
that ﬂuke thing. I hope it hasn’t
turned anything around because it’s
the kind of rivalry we want.

“Some games you, win, some you
don’t. But Foge is a great guy. We
have a lot of exciting football ahead
of us down the road wherever we
go.”

This year’s turnoff is I-279 East,
the Oakland exit not too far beyond.

.:\

Grid Bits:

As Pitt awaits an official
phone call at 6 p.m. Saturday »
from the Fiesta Bowl, the latest
possibility for Joe Paterno’s
troops seems to be an appear-
ance in the Aloha Bowl.

“I talked to the kids [Monday]
for five minutes about it,"
Paterno said. “I don’t like to talk
them about it now, but they’ve
worked hard this year and
deserve to go some place and
have fun.

“If there’s a possibility to play
a good game and have some fun,
we’ll take it. I’d just as soon have
Christmas at home; in fact it
‘would be great for the whole
coaching staff after starting so
long ago.

“But I’m here 35 years, and
[the players] are only around
four years. So if. they want [a
bowl appearance], we’ll consider
it."
’ After that, apparently drown-
ing in postseason talk, Paterno
refused to answer any more ques-
tions on Penn State bowl bids.
* 3|! * * ill

Both guard Mike Dorundo
and ﬂanker Dwight Collins are
questionable for Saturday’s
game after earlier suffering ankle I
sprains. Free safety Tom Flynn is
listed probable after suffering a
bruised shoulder and ribs in the
Army battle.

* * * III II!

Nobody, Foge Fazio included,
can predict who will be awarded
the Lambert Trophy, given to the
East’s top independent team.

“Someone mentioned it to me
last week,” Fazio said, “but I've
forgotten all about it. It used to
be a big deal when I played [late-
50s, linebacker], but I don’t
know if they still make a big
thing about it.”

Maybe it doesn’t matter if

anybody cares or not.
