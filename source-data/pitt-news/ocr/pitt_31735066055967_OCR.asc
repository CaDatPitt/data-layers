April 30.

Police entered the house at
225 N. Dithridge St. with a

possession of narcotics. The pre-

“It is my belief that the mem-

Ramirez said that the ﬁaternity

police and the University to see
the issue resolved. The members
involved have been placed on
interim suspension by the frater-

further court proceedings.

“I ‘am very confident that
with his varied background in
organizational leadership and
knowledge of traditional and

Carter will make very positive
contributions to undergraduate
education at the University,”
Provost James Maher said in
making the announcement.

Carter, who has served on
the College’s Board of Visitors
since 1993, became the dean
of the College of Lifelong

Carter, a graduate of Beloit
College who later received his
Ph.D. in Classics from
Northwestern University, was

a chosen from four or five final-

Union
campaign

Though many faculty mem-
bers agree that they need a
stronger voice on campus, at
least 60 percent of them remain
unconvinced that forming a
union is the best way to achieve
this. _

“People shared our analysis of
the problems, but-only 35 per-

proposed strategy for dealing
with those problems,” said UF
President Mark Ginsburg.

ization campaigns have failed at

week highlights
suicide prevention

By.Cale Dancho
For The Pitt News

People contemplating sui-
‘cide and their families and
friends can get help, according

, to the American. Association
of Suicidology and CON-
TACT Pittsburgh.

" May 6 through 11 has been
named Suicide Prevention
Week in Southwestern
Pennsylvania.»The aim of the
Week," a nationally promoted
event, is to make people aware
that, in most cases, suicide can
be prevented.

The first step to deter a sui-

, cidal person is "to recognize
his or her depression. The
symptoms of depression can
be seen through changes in
certain behaviors. A suicidal
person will probably talk of
death often. There can also be
changes in sleeping and eating
patterns. A person suffering

A from depression may sleep
‘ -- more or less than usual. A

' heavy eater may eat less,
whilemany others will tend to
eat more.

Another trait found in a sui-
cidal person is the tendency to

‘give personal possessions ‘

away or write a will. Usually

when giving these items away,

a suicidal person will conﬁde
in one person about his prob-
lems. When this confidant is
chosen, he or she must recog-
nize all these signs and must
act on the situation.

The first action should be to
remove any ﬁrearms from the
suicidal person’s home,
according to Betty Johnson,
R.N., director of Crisis
Intervention -at CONTACT
Pittsburgh.

“Sixty percent‘ of persons‘

who die by suicide each year
use a gun to kill themselves,”
Johnson said. “If a suicidal
person does not have a gun at
hand when he or she feels
most intent on suicide, there is
a good chance that the suicidal
crisis will wane before another
method becomes available.”
The next step in preventing
a suicide is to get help for the
troubled person. Help can be
provided by CONTACT
Pittsburgh, which has 24-hour
hotlines for Pittsburgh and
surrounding communities. The
Crisis Hotline number in
Pittsburgh is 782-4023.

Piﬂ ranks tenth in NIH funding

Pitt broke into the top ten
leading recipients of support
from the National Institutes of
Health in 1995, according to a
report compiled by the NIH
Division of Research Grants.

Pitt received $140.1 million
from the NIH during the 1995
ﬁscal year, ranking Pitt tenth
nationally among all institu-
tions receiving funds. Pitt
ranked ﬁfth among all public

grants from the NIH.

universities which received

Last year the NIH awarded
Pitt $126.1 million, ranking
them fourteenth among all

recipients.

“It clearly demonstrates the
research excellence on the part
of our faculty,” Ken Service,
Pitt’s spokesman, said. _“It also
demonstrates the national repu-
tation the university has in that
area.” '

Pitt faculty members
received more that 500 grants
from the NIH in 1995, most of
them in biomedical areas.
These grants supported

research in a variety of areas, .

including cancer treatment,

The University of Washington,
with $202.2 million, was the
leading public university.

Other western Pennsylvania
universities also received NIH
funds in 1995. Penn State

$48.5 million, and Carnegie

would constrict the diversity of
views that should thrive in an
academic environment and that
forming a union could lead to a
strike. .

The UF launched its campaign
to unionize on April 30, 1995 and
spent the academic year sending
out authorization cards to eligible
faculty members. The state labor
relations board requires that only
30 percent sign authorization
cards before an election-* can be
held for faculty members to
choose whether they want to be
represented by a union in collec-
tive bargaining. But UF leaders
said at the beginning of the cam-
paign ﬂiat they wouldn’t ﬁle for

an election unless a majority of
faculty members signed autho-
rization cards.

Authorization cards remain
valid for one year. UF leaders
could have replenished the cards
by sending them out again to sup-
porters, Ginsburg said, but didn’t
see any evidence that would justi-
fy expending more time and
energy to continue the campaign.

“I think it was a responsible,
realistic decision,” said Philip
VV1on, UF secretary.

“Most people who have sup-
ported it are disappointed and
surprised that more colleagues
haven’t joined us in this cam-
paign,” Ginsburg said. “But this
recognizes a redirection of our

energies towards some of the
same goals.”

Ginsburg said UF members
would resume the campaign
when they see more support for a
union, but in the meantime will
work on faculty issues through
governance groups such as the
Senate Council and Faculty
Assembly, and with outside
groups such as the Pennsylvania
Higher Education Coalition and
the Alliance for Progressive
Action.

- According to those who oppose
a union, the governance groups
are the more appropriate channels
to effect change anyway. But

that skin cancer is not a single
disease. It includes melanoma
and non-melanoma skin can-
cer, both having different caus-
es and predisposing factors.”

There are over 800,000
cases a year of highly curable
basal cell or squamous cell
cancers. This year alone, an
estimated 9,430 deaths have
occurred from skin cancer.

There are many different
factors that can predispose
people to skin cancer, includ-
ing excessive sun exposure.
Other risk factors include X-
ray treatment, scars related to
burns and chronic ulcers.
These cancer cells often
appear in the form of a pale,
waxlike, pearly nodule or a
red, scaly, sharply outlined
patch.

The most serious type of
skin cancer is melanoma.
Melanoma is expected to be

diagnosed in about 38,200
people in 1996. Some risk fac-
tors for melanoma include
family history of the disease,
one or more unusual moles, a
birth mole or a single, large
mole. These moles serve as
early detectors if they‘ increase
in size, change color or
become ulcerated.

Melanoma is a disease in
which cancer cells are found in
the cells that color the skin. It
can spread quickly to other

parts of the body through the.

lymphatic system or through
the blood. Depending on the
stage of the melanoma, there
are several treatments but
surgery is the primary treat-
ment for all stages.
Self-examinations should be
done periodically. One sug-
gested method involves exam-
ining the body in a mirror with
arms raised. Elbows should be
bent to look at forearms, the

tions. ,

“To set goals in stone before
I arrive would be like saying I
know everything before I get
there, and I don’t,” Carter said.
“We [the CGS faculty] need to
develop our goals and objec-
tives jointly. Right now, I have
only broad expectations.”

Some of'Carter’s expecta-
tions for the path of CGS
include increasing enrollment
and reevaluating the day-to-
day administrative process for
efficiency and effectiveness.
He will also be looking at the
organization of the College,
both internally and in its rela-
tions with the rest of the
University.

Carter hopes to study how
CGS relates to other programs
offered by Pitt, like summer
classes and supportive services
offered to students, and to fur-
ther develop those relations.

“For me, it was time to move
on and get some new blood, to
do some other kinds of things
from scratch,” Carter said.
“Pitt is a great institution to
start building at. There’s a lot
of potential because it’s a first-
rate research and academic
institution.”

Carter is the second person
named as a permanent replace-
ment for any of the open posi-
tions at Pitt. In March, Gerald
Holder was named the new
dean of the School of
Engineering after H.K Chang
resigned in February to

become the vice
chancellor/president of the
City University of Hong Kong.

Eight positions now remain
open.’ Of them, search commit-
tees are nearing completion of
the searches for chancellor and
deans of the Business School
and the Graduate School of
Public and International

‘ Affairs.

Last summer, Business
School Dean H.J. Zoffer and
Medical School Dean George
Bernier Jr. resigned. In early

September, College of Arts and

Sciences Dean Mary Briscoe,
and Dean of Graduate Studies
for the Faculty of Arts and
Sciences Mary Lou Soffa fol-
lowed. In addition, Pitt’s chief
fundraiser, Larry Weber,
resigned as vice chancellor for
institutional advancement in
October.

More recently, in February,
Senior Vice‘ Chancellor for
Business and Finance Ben
Tuchi left, as did Holder’s pre-
decessor, H.K. Chang. The
position for senior vice chan-
cellor for health sciences also
remains vacant.

No search committees have
been formed yet for CAS,
Graduate Studies or Medical
School deans, nor for senior
vice chancellors in health sci-
ences or business and finance.
According to Pitt spokesman
Ken Service, these committees
will be formed after depart-
ment restructuring is discussed
and a permanent chancellor is
named.

union supporters often point out
that decisions made by these
groups have no legal weight and
are often overlooked by the
administration. '

Many factors contributed to the
failure of the UF campaign,
including the fact that not all fac-
ulty members are directly affect-
ed by cuts in programs, and an
increased work load, even
though the university as a whole
is experiencing ﬁnancial turbu-
lence, Ginsburg said.

“It was hard to get people to
look to the common good of the
faculty,” Wion said. “Too many
groups seemed to be focused on
their particular part of the univer-
sity rather than the needs of the
faculty as a whole.”

Faculty members and students
alike also wondered whether a
much would shift the university’s
emphasis from academics to fac-
ulty salaries and beneﬁts, which
could fatten an already growing
tuition.

Ginsburg said he met with stu-

: . dent leaders and talked to stu- ‘

dents in classes to address these
concerns.

“The faculty also recognizes
financial constraints and have
argued for other means of
improving economic conditions
besides raising tuition,” Ginsburg
said.

People also wondered whether
a faculty union would increase
the likelihood of a strike. The
faculty union at Temple
University staged a strike in 1991
which preceded the defeat of a
union campaign at Pitt that year.

‘ The other failed election for a

faculty union at Pitt came in

41976.

According to Ginsburg, the Pitt
community’s search for a new
chancellor.didn’t seem to inﬂu-
ence the campaign for better or
worse. -

A more inﬂuential factor was
the negative way in which unions
are perceived in society,
Ginsburg said. Many faculty
members didn’t feel comfortable
with the idea of collective bar-
gaining, even though UF leaders
said that decisions would be
made through a democratic

process. .
“Becoming part of a group that
makes decisions

collective1y...was a little bit
unsettling to people,” Ginsburg
said. Despite UF efforts through-
out the year to make faculty more
comfortable with the idea, “many
people are not convinced.”
Relations between the adminis-

tration and the faculty went more _

smoothly this year than in years

past, but union supporters say -

collective bargaining is still nec-
essary to protect the interests of
faculty members in the future.

“The cooperative relationship '

between faculty and administra-
tion is better than it has often
been,” Wion said. “But  if that
relationship deteriorates then it’s
clearly the administration and the
trustees who have the ﬁnal say.

Opinions / Editorial

Welcome to The Pitt News

This issue marks the first issue in volume‘ 91 of The Pitt News.
This year will see a number of changes for the University and
also for the paper. At the same time,The Pitt News will continue
to serve as both a source of information for, and voice of, the
students.

The goal of this year’s editorial board is to provide students
with information that they can use during their time here at Pitt.
To do this, however, the students need to take an active role both
in University life and at the paper.

Anyone is welcome to write for any section — all they need to
do is contact the section editor. Any complaints about the paper
should be put into writing in a letter to the editor. It will then be
printed on the editorial page. All letters must include a telephone
number so that the author can be verified. Any factual errors
should be pointed out to the editors by calling the paper. A cor-
rection will run in the next paper. All of the necessary phone
numbers can be found at the bottom of this page, along with the
address for the paper. —

A word about columnists is in order at this point. Columnists’
opinions are their own and do not reﬂect the opinions of The Pitt
News. Remarks and counter-argurnents should be addressed in
letters to the editor. ‘ ‘

Protect student interests

Recently, United Faculty (UF) suspended its drive to unionize
faculty members. The people UF members were aiming to
unionize were instructors and professors here at the University
of Pittsburgh. When a majority of the faculty did not return
signed cards saying that they were in support of a union, the

. drive was suspended until UF sees evidence ‘of more support. In
- the meantime, they will look for other ways to deepen the

impact of faculty voice on campus.

The faculty are the people who are most in-touch with the stu-
dent body, more so than the administration or the trustees.
Because of this, they have an active interest in the students and
many interests are complementary, if not concomitant.
Therefore, it is in the best interest of the students if faculty
interests are represented in an effective manner before the
administration.

While most faculty didn’t support the union drive, it’s impor-
tant that they keep in mind how best to protect themselves from
the administration’s power. One reason cited by faculty for not
supporting the union was that they were afraid that too much
attention would be focused on contracts and salary and not on
students and academics. Faculty should make sure that they
have the power to protect student interests by working to pro-
tect themselves. Without a strong voice, they will be in no posi-
tion to help further student interests on campus.

Step inside Rick Now|in’s ‘mind...

Rick
Nowlin

Some random thoughts from
this overage college student:

- The anti-abortion reaction to
President Clinton’s veto of the
partial-birth abortion bill is pro-
ducing more heat than light,
which is exactly what the
Republicans had in mind when

they sent it to him in the first

place. They failed to mention
that such and other late-term
abortions are already illegal in
most states anyway. Wichita,
Kan. is home to one of six clin-
ics nationwide that performs
those types of abortions —
which is why Operation Rescue
was there three years ago.

0 I don’t understand why peo-

ple still refer to the three guys
who were caught in the Zeta
Beta Tau’s photo scandal as
pledges. In fact, they were
newly-initiated full brothers.
The fraternity, of which I am
also a brother (alumnus, to be
sure), abolished pledging on the
national level in 1989.

- Men’s hoop fans, you can
forget about Vassil Evtimov, the
Long Island prep star and
Bulgarian native that my col-
league Mike Kovak raved
about. Coach Willard had to
compete with Dean Smith for
his services, and when you have
to do that, you usually lose.
That’s why Evtimov will be
wearing blue this November —
North Carolina blue.

- Republican presidential
hopeful Alan Keyes apparently
doesn’t know how to handle
rejection. During the Georgia
primary election campaign, he
wasn’t invited to a debate at
WSB-TV in Atlanta; when he
tried to enter anyway, station
management had him arrested.
He later appeared on another
Atlanta TV station, accused
WSB of being “pro-Clinton”
and declared himself “the only
candidate who’ can beat Bill
Clinton.”

Excuse me, Mr. Keyes, but
the last time I checked, you
only had about 7 percent of the
vote - from your own party. If
you can’t beat “Ol’ One-Arm”
(which one of my co-workers, a
Republican, calls Bob Dole),
what makes you think that
“Slick Willie” won’t clean your
clock?

0 I can’t speak for others, but

this Christian wasn’t at all
offended with the Apr. 18 issue
of The Vox which declared that
“Christianity is Stupid.” To the
unenlightened, Christianity is
indeed stupid - but to those of
us who know better...

0 Don’t tell anyone, but my
former editor Erika Kendra isn’t
really the right-wing witch peo-
ple often make her out to be.

_ I’ve gotten to know her pretty

well over the past year, and I
found her to be a very sweet
person. (I dunno - maybe she
just liked me.) Oh, and here’s
another secret: She voted for
Clinton four years ago.

- I ﬁnd it amusing that local
politicians and other civic lead-
ers are trying to ﬁnd ways to
lure Pittsburghers “back down-
town.” Oh, please - they never
did come downtown to begin
with! Most Pittsburgh neighbor-
hoods and older suburbs had
their own business and cultural
districts, plus the steel mills
were, for the most part, outside
the city limits. On the other
hand, when I was growing up,
the department stores closed at
5 o’clock four days a week!

0 Another example of right-
wing hypocrisy when it comes
to “big government”: the so-
called Freemen. They refuse to
subject themselves to any
authority, resulting in the cur-
rent standoff with the FBI at
their compound outside Jordan,
Mont. However, neighbors
noted they were also ﬁrst in line
to get government water subsi-
dies to maintain their farm.
Curious?

0 More on presidential poli-

tics: Mark Elfstrand, a Clinton
critic and the host of the talk
show on which I do a regular
segment, blasted Clinton for
playing politics with the
Commerce Department, saying

the department was “safe” after

the death of Ron Brown, its sec-
retary. However, Elfstrand
didn’t mention that congres-
sional Republicans fully intend-
ed to shut Commerce down
during budget proceedings.

Why was Commerce was a
target? Because Brown, who as
DNC chairman helped Clinton
get elected (and the GOP is still
sore about that), was running it
like a top — and swiped much
of the big-business lobby, a tra-
ditional GOP constituency, in
the process. Did you notice that
the U. S. Chamber of
Commerce didn’t endorse a
candidate in the last election?
Brown had a lot to do with that.

0 I’m a little tired of people
complaining about Gov.
Ridge’s proposed 6.5 cents per
gallon gasoline tax, the pro-
ceeds of which will help to
rebuild the roads ravaged by
this past winter’s weather. In
fact, it may prove more expen-
sive in the long run without the
tax. How so? Consider this:
Your insurance premiums will
rise, either because you’ll have
to take your car in for repairs
more often or someone will sue
the commonwealth as the result
of an accident. (Remember the
“cole slaw” lady?)

0 And one last thing: If you
want to hear the greatest rock
‘n’ roll band of all time, head to
Star Lake on Jun. 8. I’m talking
about Chicago, the much-
maligned octet that has record-

ed more styles of music than.

most bands even attempt. And
when those guys are on, no one
can touch them. No one. Yes,
Dimitri, they do belong in the
Hall of Fame.Rick Nowlin is a

Reaganites were wrong -- the '80s weren't so great

Michael
Berqulst ‘

I ‘was amused a few months
. ago to see a bumper sticker
with Ronald Reagan’s face
upon it and an accompanying
caption that read: “Remember
when America had a real
President?” I had to laugh at
the bumper sticker’s attempt to
imply that Reagan was a good
president.
My amusement increased

when I happened to read a ‘

speech by George Will in his
book The Leveling Wind.
Will’s speech was a long-

winded celebration of how

wonderful the 1980s were and
what a great President Ronald
Reagan was.

It didn’t bother me that Will,
a conservative lap—dog whose
writings about Reagan border
on propaganda, actually
believed his own rhetoric.
Instead, what did bother me
was that people have actually
accepted the notion that the
1980s were an idyllic time for
America and that Ronald
Reagan was anything but a
failure as President.

Most Reaganites typically
become angry at charges that
they are the party of the rich
and privileged and that their

economic policies benefit the
rich. However, of the tremen-

dous growth in income which

conservatives boast of ’ during
the 1980s, a whopping 70 per-
cent went to America’s richest
1 percent. While most
Reaganites may argue that
every American is now well-
off as a‘ result of Reagan’s
policies , the facts of the mat-
ter are as clear as day: During
the 1980s the richest 1 percent
saw their incomes double,
while the poorest one-fifth saw
their wages and income drop
10 percent. The Congressional
Budget Office says that in
1980 the richest one-fifth of
Americans had eight times the
money of the poorest one-
fifth. By 1989 that disparity
had increased to twenty to one.
Facts don’t lie.

When asked about the tril-
lions of dollars Americans
owe in debt, Reaganites typi-
cally blame the Democrat-con-
trolled Congress for. that debt.
This argument defies common
sense. In 1985 Reagan submit-
ted a budget to Congress that

contained $588 billion in

spending. Congress appropri-

‘ated $583 billion, $5 billion

less than Reagan wanted. If
Reagan was trying to cut the
budget despite Congress’s
objections, then why is it that

Congress was doing the cut-

ting and Reagan was doing the

spending? Richard Ben
Cramer wrote in his book
What It Takes about the 1985
budget: “Reagan kept saying
the deficit was Public Enemy
Number One. But then he sent
up a budget that would have
pumped red ink up over the
window sills. It was a laugh-
ingstock!”

Reagan himself was an
incompetent leader who
lacked the ability to under-
stand the most basic concepts
of how the government works.
For example, in 1985 Senators
Barry Goldwater and Sam
Nunn came to meet with him
to discuss the effects of the
recently passed Gramm-
Rudman law’s effect on the
defense budget. The law
forced the government to
make across-the—board cuts
when Congress and the
President couldn’t agree on a
balanced budget. In their
meeting, Secretary of Defense
Casper Weinburger com-
plained about Gramm-

-Rudman’s effect upon the

defense department. When
Senator Nunn politely pointed
out that Reagan had enthusias-
tically supported Gramm-

— Rudman, the President piped

in that while he had supported

Gramm—Rudman, nobody had
ever told him that the cuts
were mandatory. The fact that
Reagan failed to grasp the
whole- idea behind a measure
to which he had lent his full
support is scary.

Stories like this.became so
common during Reagan’s
administration that Speaker of
the‘ House Tip O’Neill
remarked in sorrow: “He
knows less than any President
PVCCVCI‘ known.”

I have a question for
Reaganites: If Reagan was
really such a wonderful
President, then why is
American in such terrible
shape today?

Reagan supporters may
argue that Democrats in
Congress sabotaged his pro-
gram (an argument that I’ve
already proven is little more
than hot air) or even go so far
as to say that George Bush
betrayed the Reagan legacy. If
that is true, it is a startling
admission by the Reaganites:
that his legacy was so weak
that it didn’t even survive the
administration of a conserva-
tive Republican. '

If Reaganomics were really
so popular then why didn’t
Democrats hop onto the “me
too” bandwagon and endorse
supply-side economics much

Jousting with the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse

Ben'amin
J ac son I

The ‘90s seem to be a pretty bleak time.
After the massive, soap bubble-like
growth of the 1980s, we are now in a
decade of uncertainty and anxiety. The
generation of college students in particu-
lar is in a peculiar spot, as we are stuck in
a transitional reference frame. The follow-
ing quote of sums up the position of the
children of the ‘80s, as we’ve been called:

“What do you say, for instance, about a
generation that has been taught that rain
is poison and sex is death? If making
love might be fatal_and if a cool spring
rain on any summer afternoon can turn a
crystal blue lake into a puddle of black
poison scum right in front of your eyes,
there is not much left except TV and
relentless masturbation.” — Hunter S.
Thompson, in ‘Generation of Swine: Tales
of Shame and Degradation in the ‘80s

The generation in question is us, we
who have so many names. And while the
lessons that sex is death and rain is poison
may very well be true, it is not entirely
clear that we have learned our lesson.
Even if we have, and AIDS and environ-
mental pressures have entered our collec-
tive consciousness, no one is particularly
clear what to do about it. The only
recourse we seem to have is to whine
about it. There is either angst or igno-
rance. Ignorance, meaning that we know
the problem is there, but we choose to
ignore it and try to go on as though the
world will not change at all.

As we make the run up to the end of
this century, we face the fact that we soon
will be taking over at various levels and
trying to deal with what the previous gen-
erations have left behind. There is often
talk that we are not like our parents, and
our activism and optimism is non-exis-

tent. At the same time, the problems that
face the world today—do not admit of a
decisive, concrete nature; There is more to
learn and the solutions to the problems
being faced are more complicated. We
don’t have the ﬂashy, concrete or sexy
issues like war, civil rights, and the
prospect of an evil empire to defeat. This
is not to say that things have not always
been complicated. There are no “good

ole’ days” except in memory. Those who .

can remember earlier times will recall that
things were complicated and there were
people who were angry and hurt and
afraid.

Toward the end of the last century,
many end—of-the-world cults gathered on
mountain tops and in remote places
expecting a second coming, or the rapture
or some other apocalyptic event. They
were all sure they had God on their side.
Yet, when the appointed hour came, noth-
ing happened. ‘

The world is in much the same boat
today. It is much like the run up to New
Year’s every year. Yet, when the clock
strikes midnight, nothing really changes.
It is all the same on New Year’s day. This
is what leaves people with a Vague sense
of dissatisfaction. There is no open strug-
gle to rally around.

So, it may be true that the Four
Horsemen are on the loose: War, Famine,
Pestilence, and Death, in no particular
order. They are not the precursor of any
future, decisive event. Instead, they will
always be with us, and we will need peo-
ple who are ready to go out and joust with
them. - _

Our field of battle is everywhere. It is
outside in the rain and even in our own
bedrooms, as the quote above shows. As
we take over the messes that have been
left to us, we must realize that like it or
not, it won’t be easy. The good times
come to everyone while they are young
because their happiness is looked after.

-Being aware that what is happening all

around you can and will touch you is a
sign of maturity.

A recent study, conducted by the
National Cancer Institute suggests that
one in 92 American men ages 27 to 39 are
infected with HIV and that one in 33
black men in this same age group are

I infected. AIDS became the number one

killer of Americans aged 25 to 44 in 1993,
according to the Centers For Disease

-Control,(New York Times, Nov. 24,

1995). New plagues are popping up all
over , and the oldones are becoming
more virulent as they resist current antibi-
otics. There is plague.

War is always with us, it is just in vari-
ous places throughout the world. But if
you look at the stand off in Montana, the
drive-by shootings, and the events like
firebombings in the subways and the
Oklahoma City Bombing, war is right
here in the heartland as well.

Famine is a matter of deﬁnition. Can we
include malnourishment in with famine?
Then, even it is ubiquitous in the industri-
alized world, which should be able to feed
all its people.

Death balances ou-t the population.
There is much personal destruction going
on in people. They have the ability to
make the changes to avoid their own per-
sonal destruction, but don’t. This is not
going to turn into pontiﬁcation about how

‘to live, but self-discipline is not all that

hard.

So what do you say to a generation that
has been taught that sex is death and rain
is poison? “Wear a condom” and “have

A enough sense to get in out of the rain,”

perhaps? Well, the key is to let them know
that they will be jousting with the four
horsemen throughout their lives, and that
others have done it before.

If we are knights, we’d best sharpen our
lances and mount up — the horsemen are
riding down on us.

like the Rockefeller
Republicans endorsed the New
Deal? Also, why have so many
economists (liberal and con-
servative) studied supply-side
and have dismissed it, as
Stanford economist Paul
Krugman has, as little more
than a cartoonishly simple
gimmick. If Reaganomics
were so wonderful for every
American, than why did medi-
an family income (the index
that measures the income of
the typical American family)
slow down dramatically dur-
ing the l980s from 2.5% in the
years following World War II
to just 0.4% between 1979 and
1989?

Conservatives are in denial

and need to accept the fact that A

the 1980s were a disaster for
America. Under Reagan, the
United States went from being
the world’s biggest creditor
nation to being the world’s
biggest‘ debtor nation.
Conservatives don’t want to
admit it, but during the 1980s
the rich got richer, the poor got
poorer and America’s middle-

class watched as their living 1

standards began a slow, grad-

ual decline that continues

today.

that final class of the year.
They’re getting ready to
start their summer jobs
and making plans to hit the
beach, only to have the fun
and sun ripped away from
them again come late
August when school
begins again.

There is, however, a
growing list of tykes who
have taken their last math
tests and have theirsights
set on some different num-
bers, most of them in the
seven-figure range. You
guessed it: the time has
come for underclassmen to
skip out on their educa-
tions and make the jump to
the pros.

V During the NFL Draft
held April 20 and 21, over
20 underclassmen were
selected. Players like
Nebraska’s Lawrence
Phillips probably made the
,right decision to leave
school, but most of these
kids are having a difficult
time seeing past the huge
dollar signs to their
futures, which most likely
won’t include athletics
forever. ’

This phenomenon isn’t
only popular with the foot-
ball players. In fact, the
world of college basketball
and the path to the NBA is
being clogged by just
about anyone these days.
As of right now, the June
26 NBA Draft will have 1.6
underclassmen gracing its
talent pool. The most
notable of these sixteen
adolescents would have to
be a pair of high school
buddies in Lower Merion,
Pennsylvania’s Kobe
Bryant and Jermaine
O’Neal of Eau Claire High
School in South Carolina.

leader in catches, will be hauling in passes in Kansas City.

of this year. Saturday was set aside for the first three rounds,
and there wasn’t a name called from the University of
Pittsburgh. It didn’t take long on Sunday, though, before the
Panthers made their way into the pros.

The Panther’s all-time leading receiver, Dietrich Jells was

’ the first Pitt player taken. The Kansas City Chiefs, who had

the best record in the NFL last season at 13-3, selected Jells
with the third pick in the sixth round. ’

This speedster hasbeen timed at 4.43 in the 40-yard dash
and finished his career at Pitt with a school-record 3,003
receiving yards. Last season, Jells was selected second-team
Big East All-Conference by The Associated Press and All-
Conference and honorable mention All-American by The
F ootbal-l News.

Only eight picks later a team took its chances on a Panther
when Jeff Fisher and the Houston Oilers selected cornerback

Anthony Dorsett, Jr. This Texas native now has the chance to

dazzle the natives like his father did with the Dallas
Cowboys in the late 1970s and through the 1980s.

At 5-foot-ll and 190 pounds, Dorsett may have trouble
with some of the taller receivers in the league, but his speed
and overall athletic ability impressed scouts. Dorsett spent
two years shufﬂing positions before settling into the right
cornerback position where he picked off three passes last
season and ended with a team-high eight pass deﬂections

Defensive backs coach Tony Pierce is confident about
Dorsett’s chances with the Oilers.

“Whether you’re a first round, sixth round or free agent,
it’s all the same when you get into camp,” Pierce said.

“[Dorsett] is focused, working out hard and he’s getting tips 3

from players that have already been there to help him adjust
to the pro game.”

He had his arguably best game .of the year against a solid
Ohio State receiving corps as he intercepted two Bobby
Hoying passes and recorded seven tackles (four solo) despite
Pitt’s lopsided loss. '

Dorsett barely had time to don his Oilers cap, hug his dad
and pose for some pictures before the Cincinatti Bengals
took 6-foot-4, 240 pound linebacker Tom Tumulty with the

12th pick of the sixth Round. Tumulty anchored the Pan_t_her__

Baseball whiffs down the home stretch

By Mike Kovak
Sports Editor '

As students unwound and
relaxed after finals, the Pitt
baseball team continued its
quest to the Big East
Championships, won last
year by the Panthers in
shocking fashion. ,

Unfortunately for Pitt,
things have not proceeded
according to plan. .

The Pitt baseball team fell
from contention for a spot
in the conference postsea-
son tournament after drop-
ping both games of a dou-
bleheader to ‘conference
powerhouse Notre Dame, 8-
3 and 2-0, on April 30, in
South Bend, Ind.

The Panthers ventured to
Kent University on May 1
for a non-conference game
and left with a 5-4 rain-
shortened victory before
splitting a road doublehead-
er against the Boston
College Eagles on Sunday.
Pitt lost the first game, 3-2,
then rallied to win the final
game, 9-3. _

‘‘I knew we were officially
eliminated from the playoffs
before we played BC,” said
Head Coach Mark Jackson.
“Of course, we didn’t let
them know. But you have to
play hard regardless.”

After that series of games,
Pitt’s record stands at 24-
20-2 (9-13-0). This record
does not include yesterday’s
game at Wright State, the
final game of the season for
the Panthers, who finished
fifth out of six teams in the
American Division of the
Big East Conference.

“We didn’t play with a
sense of urgency this year.
The key is hunger,” Jackson
said. “This season was dis-
appointing according to the
goals we set at the begin-

Crew prepares for the huge Dacl Vail Tournament

By Nichole Gantshar
Staff Writer

At the Metro-Atlantics, held on the Occoquon in Virginia on May 5, the
Panthers competed against college-sponsored teams with varsity athletic

Dozens of boats will descend on Philadelphia’s Schuylkill River this
weekend to begin the Dad Vail Championships, a race begun 70 years ago

as the championship for small colleges.

“It’s the largest college regatta in the world,” said Greg Egnor, Head

Coach of Pitt’s women’s crew team.
The Dad Vail will be the last race of the Panthers’ season.

“I’m real happy with their progress,” said Egnor who is a new coach for

the team.

At the Dad Vail, the Panthers will compete with a men’s
novice 8, men’s lightweight 8, men’s varsity 8, women’s
novice 8, and a women’s varsity 4.

“The women’s varsity 4 has really been coming along,”
said Egnor about their performance at last weekend’s Metro
Atlantic Collegiate Crew Championship.

“They are ascrappy little boat that’s just rowing their
hearts out.” p .

The crew competes in the heavyweight category, but two of
the fourarowers are in the lightweight category. Of the light-
weights, one weighs 118 pounds and the other weighs -124
pounds.

Additionally, the varsity 4’s crew contains a novice rower,
freshman Mary Martin.

“It was the most competitive race of the day. We got fourth
place, an eighth of a tenth of a second off of third place,”
said Egnor. .

“To be that close a mile and quarter and see less than a sec-
ond separate the two crews  it’s very fast.” .

Egnor hopes the crew, which also includes senior Katie
Holland, sophomore Michele Mielke, senior.Maureen
McGuigan and freshman Coxswain Summer Craze, has a
chance of getting a medal at the Dad Vail Championships.
They also finished third at the Big East rowing champi-
onship.

Track competes in Big
EastChampions11ips

The 1996 Big East Outdoor Track & Field
Championships took place over the weekend and several
of Pitt’s top-notch athletes fared very well in a competi-
tion that saw the Lady Panthers finish fourth and the men
place ninth.

First of all, Pitt’s all—time track legend Najuma Fletcher
was named the women’s Most Outstanding Field
Performer after winning the high jump with a leap of 1.80
meters and the triple jump withl3.83 meters. Both dis-
tances are Big East meet records.

Fletcher was upset in the long jump by freshman team-
mate Trecia Smith. Smith outdistanced Fletcher with an
outstanding leap of 6.43 meters. Fletcher’s best jump was
measured at 6.15 meters.

The Lady. Panthers set seven different__ team bests this
year at the championships. Sprinter Ayne Allen ran a
55.67 in the 400-meter dash, good enough for fourth
place.

Jay Jones earned the only first place finish on the men’s
side of the competition. In keeping with a Pitt tradition,

‘Jones waxed the other runners in the 100-meter dash with

a scorching time ‘of 10.33. Pitt has won the event for three
consecutive years. Jones also placed second in the 200-
meter dash with a time of 21.0. ’ A p _

Their season will continue May 11 for the four-day Pitt
invitational at Pitt Stadium.

action.

This Penn Hills native is one of only six
players in modern Pitt Football history to start
the first ever game of his freshman season.
Others include Tony Dorsett, Marc Spindler,
Hugh Green, Bill Fralic and Ricardo
McDonald. Tumulty finished third on the
school’s all-time tackle list with 413 tackles. ,

In 1995, Tumulty was named to the first-
team All-Conference squad and first—team All-
Big East, as well as honorable mention All-
American by The Football News.

“The things Tom does you’ll be able to see
more on the field than you would be able to
see in the films,” linebackercoach Bob
Babich said. ‘.‘He’s a dependable player with a
great work ethic; he’s really a student of the
game. I think he’ll do well.”

Defensive tackle Mike Halapin wasn’t
selected in the seven-round draft but recently
signed a free—agent contract with the Houston
Oilers, joining Dorsett.

“It’s always good having someone from
your team alongside you,” Pierce said.v“They
will probably talk before and after practices
and always be pushing each other. It’s going
to be a plus for both of them.”

Column

from page 8

Kobe’s coming out party, huh? Kobe has said that
the success of Kevin Garnett, the 6-11 prodigy
from Farragut Academy in Chicago who played

hookie last year and had a so—so rookie year with .

the Timberwolves, had no influence on his choice.
Sure, the catchy Nike commercial Garnett starred
in with Jason Kidd, Jimmy Jackson, Eddie Jones
and Joe Smith didn’t tempt Kobe at all.

O’Neal, who is awaiting the results from his lat-
est attempt at the SAT, has said that if he doesn’t
qualify academically then he will toss his name
into the hat along with Bryant. NBA scouts have
frowned ‘upon the decisions made by these young-
sters, saying that making the jump to the pros
from high school is simply too hard. Garnett has
had difficulty adjusting his game to fit the NBA
style, and this is the same guy who a year ago was
touted as quite possibly the greatest high school
player ever. , ' '

Even if these guys did decide to make some col-
lege coach happy as alark, how long would they
stay around anyway? Georgia Tech coach Bobby
Cremins hit the jackpot in March of 1995 when he
signed New York City’s latest point guard wizard
Stephon Marbury. The 6-1 prize was regarded as
the next Kenny Anderson, if not better.

So why was Cremins back in NYC last summer
recruiting yet another point guard? He knew that

a name for himself at Tech; he would make a
name for himself with a lottery team soon enough.

Joining these fellas will be superstars Ray Allen
of UConn, Marcus Camby of UMass and
Georgetown’s Allen Iverson. These players will
make some noise in the NBA, but what makes no
sense is how some mediocre-at—best players get
the crazy idea in their heads that they will be suc-
cessful at the next level.

‘Who told Cal—State Bakersfield’s Kebu Stewart
that his game was ready for the NBA? Maybe
Dionne Warwick. What about Vitaly Potapenko of
Wright State? This seven footer couldn’t guard
David Spade let alone David Robinson. (For a
complete list of underclassmen eligible for the
draft - see the box below the story.) V

Some of these youngsters will have their dreams
come true, but what about the gritty guys like
Wake Forest’s monster center Tim Duncan? In
Duncan’s case, he would have been number one
last year or this year and will no doubt be number
one next year if he decides to stick ‘around. That’s
a big “if.”

What happens to the players who stick around
and fulfill the commitments they made to their
schools? They end up getting lost in the shuffle of
those fresh off the school bus, or Mercedes, or
whatever they maybe driving to and from class.

Scott Lobaugh registered
two of Pitt’s three hits.

“It’s been the same story
all year,” Jackson said.
“Other years we over-

year we underachieved. We
couldn’t hit with guys in

some good chances against

In the first game, Pitt’s

‘Entertainment 12
Gitbox and Joyner: Not your parents’ folk music

It seems that after the Palace
Brothers started to put out

records, the indie community

came to the conclusion that
country music was allright.
The same kids who were slant-
ed and enchanted by “slacker”
rock searched through their
parents’ record collections
looking for gems by the likes
of Merle Haggard, Hank
Williams and Johnny Cash.

, The “country is o.k.” vibe was

confirmed when Mr. Cash
recorded a brilliant album for
Rick Rubin’s American

‘Records (formerly Def Jam,

Def American), a partnership
that also ‘scored Johhny an
MTV hit, “Delia.”

Similarly, “lo-fi” became
(is?) the fashionable buzz-
word; any record with that tag
was bound to have credibility.
Lou Barlow with his first
Sebadoh record and countless
Sentridoh records gave many
the confidence to record bed-
room masterpieces with a lone
accoustic guitar and confes-
sional lyrics. One facet of the
lo-fi movement had a decisive
folk edge to it and had a cer-
tain kinship with the ‘60s folk

‘renaissance. Smog, the Mt.

Goats, and Beck all released
home recordings complete
with similar instrumentation
and urgency of a Bob Dylan or
Phil Ochs record. These artists
thankfully gave the indipen-
dent scene some much needed
diversity and encouraged

many fans to put down their

Slint records and explore other
genres.

- Brinkman Records showcas-
es some of these fine singer-
songwriters. What’s more
impressive is that the label has
put the bands on the road and
the show stops at Pittsburgh!
Of the three Brinkman bands
showcased on the tour, Gitbox
may be the most unknown.
The Dutch duo’s name comes
from an old slang term for the
guitar. Don’t be fooled, how-
ever — the guitar is not the
only instrument you’ll hear.
Their album Our Lady of the
Highway is graced with banjo,
piano, organ, among others,
played by core members Philip
Harder and Roeland van Niele,
and features the drumming of
Wilf Plum (Dogl Faced
Hermans). The songs are deli-
cate and the focus is on the
poignant lyrics. _

Joost Visser, another Dutch
sensation, might be familiar
with Bettie Serveert fans.
Visser was the guitar player
and singer for the legendary
De Artsen, which transformed
into Bettie Serveert in 1990.
He busied himself by record-
ing a solo album with solid
guitars, Bono-like vocals and
tape loops that Ajax happily
released, and worked with
Dump (Yo La Tengo’s James
McNew). His sound ranges
from Nick Drake-inﬂuenced
folk to fuzzed-out romps, all

undeniably emotional and pas-
sioniately delvivered sans pre-
tense.

To some at WPTS, Simon
Joyner is revered as the “Karl
Hendricks of Omaha.” Others
just dig his down—to-earth folk-
punk music. Hisvoice sounds
similar to Karl at times.
Strangely, it was Hendricks

Genesis P-Orridge’s hot itt top

Now that every other high
school football player is wear-
ing a Nine Inch Nails t-shirt
and bands like Ministry and
Front 242 have become staples
on the Lollapalooza circuit, it’s’
hard to remember just what
“real” Industrial music is, and
where it came from. Well, for
one thing, “real” industrial
music is seldom made any-
more. Beginning in 1975,

European bands like
Throbbing Gristle and
Einsturzende Neubauten

recorded the percussive sounds
of heavy machinery and scrap-
ing metal to create a .particu-
larly undanceable soundscape
of “music” which eventually
mutated into the techno/heavy
metal guitar—oriented so-called
Industrial music of the ‘80s
and ‘90s.

Genesis P—Orridge coined
the term “Industrial Music”
and formed Industrial Records
in 1976 in order to put out
releases by his band Throbbing
Gristle. Prior to that, the
Manchester—born multimedia
performance artist/musician
was involved in the seminal
FLUXUS art collective (whose
members included such lumi-
naries as Joseph Bueys and
Yoko Ono) of the mid—’60s.
Along with Pop Art, FLUXUS
was instrumental in changing
people’s concept of the. what

“art” is. P—Orridge also collab-
orated with William Burroughs
and Brion Gysin on the pro-
motion and publication of their

that recommended that I listen
to Joyner. Most critics com-
pare him to Smog, Palace, and
Beck (who even praised
Joyner in Rolling Stone). Not

to downplay the music, but

Joyner’s talentlies in his poet-
ic lyrics and yarn-spinning
ability. Listen to the Mt. Goats
split single he did on Sing

 

Don't miss the Electric Johnsons

Enuchs! or The Cowardly
Traveler to see what I mean.
His lyrics read like amazing
stories you accidently stumble
upon in some musty book in
the library, innocently written
and‘ delivered.

What already seems like a
killer show could only be bet-
tered by one band: Two Dollar
Guitar (Smells Like Records).
The group is comprised of
Dave Motamed (Cell, Das
Daman) on bass, Steve Shelly
(Sonic Youth) on drums, and
Tim Foljahn (Mosquito, Half
Japanese) on guitar and vocals.
Shelly and Foljahn also are
two-thirds of Thurston
Moore’s Psychic’ Hearts band!
What do they sound like? The
band puts it best: sad songs for
sad times. Man, Foljahn must
be really. bummed out. The
music is brooding, whiskey-
soaked, country—tinged, and
just plain stark. In the same
territory as Nick Cave, Foljahn
sketches drunken, dreary-eyed
vignettes with poetic grace and
a sonorous barritone. The new
record Burned and Buried is
truly one of the most brutally
honest, somber records I’ve
heard in a while.

Do not miss this chance to
hear these great bands!

The White Balloon: an exercise in cinematic simplicity

Raziah gets her goldﬁsh in Panahi’s The White Balloon.

The White Balloon
directed by J afar Panahi

The urban folk tale The White
Balloon is not a stylized, drippy piece
of filmmaking, and it doesn’t over-
whelm its story with sap-and-sob
effects. Whereas so many American
ﬁlms that deal with children work nos-
talgia (and “magical” special effects) to
tell some writer’s contrived vision of

Genesis

from page 12

authors themselves, newspa-
per clippings, James Joyce
novels, etc_., in one big
Postmodern stew.

These are just a few of the
things that Genesis got his
perverse little self into before
forming the “Hyperdelic
Techno-Collective” Psychic
TV in 1981. Since then, _
Psychic TV has released over
80 recordings featuring vari-
ous lineups and has become
legendary for their mind-
expanding live performances.
Genesis himself has been
involved in a series of lecture-
circuit tours concerning
altered states of consciousness
and mind control, collabora-
tions with Mr. Timothy Leary,
and has even wasted his time
organizing raves out on the
West Coast.

Genesis P—Orridge will bless
Pittsburgh with a very rare and
special performance this
Friday night at the Unholy
Metropol, with music by co-
conspirator Larry, Thrasher
and video projections by PTV
and Brother William of the
Process Media Lab in

This man is Very Important,
and anyone with any interest
in Experimental/Industrial

be in attendance.

enchanted yesteryears, The White
Balloon is a simple story about a pouty
little girl who gets what she wants in
the end. While this doesn’t make for
rare or exciting ﬁlmmaking (and what
could with a s1ice—of-life ﬁlm about a
seven—year-old girl), it is a competent
story told with control and without
cutesy—cliché. .

The film opens with a woman and
her seven year-old daughter, Raziah,

walking home through Tehran’s
marketplace a few hours before
the beginning of the Iranian
New Year’s festival. Raziah
wants a chubby goldﬁsh for the
celebration, but her mother
doesn’t want to give her the
100-toman note for the fish.
Raziah insists on having it, so
she sulks as her mother cleans

older brother Ali chides her and
tells her to settle for the fish
they already have. But it is New
Year’s Day, and Raziah’s a
whiner, so Mom eventually
gives in and gives her a ‘.500-
toman note.

The White Balloon then settles
into ‘Raziah’s point—of-view,
depicting her mini—travels
through the marketplace, which
is populated with adults she
can’t understand. Director
Panahi focuses on Raziah’s mixed
encounters with the older set to illus-
trate the gulf between kids and their
adults. She nearly loses ‘her money a
few times. Once a snake charmer
wheedles it away from her only to give
it back, but she
later drops the 8
note into the
street gutter
where the film

and father showers, while her ,

13

spends the rest of its time showing her
trying to get it back.

You don’t have to think very hard
about whether she’ll get the money
back; however straight the story is
played, it’s still a softie movie. With
the exception of the snake charmer, the
film’s adults (most of whom are at
work) seem a little too benevolent with
this anonymous little girl.

The White Balloon is a we1l—written
exercise in simplicity, requiring little of
its audience except a willingness to
watch a little girl get what she wants.
The film has no pretentions about its
characters or themes, so if you’re look-
ing for enlightenment, it’s not to be
found here. For the most part, the ﬁlm
avoids overwrought philosophizing,
and its only tendency to comment
makes the point that “it’s good to
remember who you are, where you
come from and what you’re worth.”
The White Balloon runs with

Pittsburgh Filmmakers at the Harris
Theater, downtown. Showtimes are Q
and 8 p.m. weekdays, with additional
screening on weekends. Call 471-9700
for more info.

EVITA

music by Andrew Lloyd
Webber

Lyrics by Tim Rice

directed by Ken Gargaro

Following the modern inﬂu-
ence of rock opera, “Evita”
highlights the life of a beauti-
ful Latin American personali-
ty, Eva Peron, who married the
president of Argentina.
Creators Lloyd Webber and
Rice were inspired by the true
life story of Eva (Sandra
Barg.man), a middle—class
Argentinian who teamed up
with Juan Peron (Howard
Elson), a fascist-politician, to
take control of Argentina in
1946-1955. Evita was an inﬂu-
ential radio figure who used
her media exposure to promote
Juan’s social image. The musi-
cal score gains its fame from
the distinct dramatic harmony
from such songs as “Don’t Cry
for Me Argentina” and “The
Art of the Possible.-”

Eva made a defarning spec-
tacle of herself when she made

the switch from grass roots to '

palace gates. This gives the
story a bitter irony that empha-
sizes the passionate forces that
are working against each other.
The narrator of the satire is
Che (Anthony Marino), an
Anti—Peronist, who adds an
acrid analysis of the aristocrat-

‘ ic corruption Eva markets to

the people of Argentina. Che
unveils the treachery and
exploitation of the Perons as
they gallivant around Europe
seeking support for their gov-
emment rule.

Gargaro is well known for
his innovative interpretations
of classicmusicals, incorporat-
ing rock’n’roll into large the-

atre performances. The moti-
vation behind the production
came from Gargaro’s fascina-
tion with the spellbinding
music that accompanies the
biography of Evita, the most
powerful woman in Latin
American History.

“Evita was champion of the
poor and her husband was a
fascist which makes for an
interesting story,” said
Gargaro. Evita’s public—rela—
tions inﬂuence made it possi-
ble for Juan, who supported
Hitler in the Second World
War, to win the first democrat-
ic election. Gargaro was look-
ing for a strong actress who
could fit Eva’s presence on
stage. Bargman captivates
audiences with her perfor-
mance and stands as a six—foot
blonde who is perfect for the
role.

Gargaro adds colorful ban-
ners to the set instructions to
emphasize the people’s revolu-
tion over the military, although
the classic appearance keeps
the audience reminded of the
impoverished mid—century
Argentina. ‘-‘Ladies Got
Potential” was added _from
original score.

Madonna will be starring as
Evita in the upcoming motion
picture version. Astonishingly,
the backgrounds of the two sex
icons are similar. Both are well
known for their fierce inﬂu-
ence over the public and sexu-
al mystique. The same
bleached hair and glamorous
physique characterize both
personalities. ,Madonna is
singing the original score. The
film’s release date has not
been announced. -

Gargaro’s version runs now
until May 11 at the Byham
Theatre, formally known as
the Fulton. Call 281-6771.

Rory Kunkle
For No Apparent. Reason
Moskeeto

Rory Kunkle, a.k.a. Fran
Smith, Jr. of the legendary
Philadelphia rock/folk/ska
group The Hooters, has put the
‘80s far behind him, as have
his bandmates.

While the band’s frontmen
Eric Bazilian and Rob Hyman
were producing Joan
Osborne’s hit album Relish,
bassist Smith and drummer
David Uosikkinen were busy
putting together S1nith’s first
solo album. The album, For
No Apparent Reason, is credit-
ed to Smith’s alter ego Rory
Kunkle and released on
Uosikkinen’s new indie label
Moskeeto Productions._It is a
hard-hitting guitar-rock album
that grabs you with the hyper-
active, ska-like chords of the
first song, “Ginny,” and never
lets-go.

At his debut performance as
Rory Kunkle in New Hope,
PA, Smith explained that “the
basic concept behind the
album is that it’s the ‘60s
meets the ‘90s,— or as I like
to say, the Beatles meet Hank
Williams, Sr.” Other influ-
ences can be heard on For No
Apparent Reason as well, from
Tom Petty ‘to the whole crop of
‘90s grunge rockers. “What
we’re trying to get is the sound
of the old together with the
new,” said Smith.

This attempt succeeds
admirably with cheerily
bizarre songs like “Prophet for
Jane” and “Generals in
Space,” which induce one to
think of Smith as a sort of
alternate—world Paul
McCartney who was able to
successfully capture the sound
of the ‘90s instead of burning
out. For all the effort bands
like Oasis put into trying to
become the -“new Beatles,”
Smith comes much closer with
the bouncing guitars and sum-
mertime lyrics of “Beat a
Path.”

The lyrics of “Reluctant
Matador-” suggest the nervous
energy of a nascent solo artist:
“Children throw their hats at
me / I feel I’ve failed them-ter-

ribly / Castanets ﬁll the air / I

hope nobody knows I’m
scared.”

The closing Cat Stevens-like
ballad, “Have a Good Life,”
was inspired by a less intimate
source. “I was watching an
episode of Cheers,” said
Smith, “the one where Diane
left the show, and there’s this
line as she’s leaving, ‘Have a
good life.’ I thought, hey, this
is supposed to be a sitcom, but
here’s this really serious, mov-
ing moment.”

For No Apparent Reason is
available in Phi1adelphia—area
music stores as well as
through mail—order (ordering
details are available at the
Rory Kunkle World Wide Web
page, accessible through
Yahoo).
