The Student Volunteer Outreach program assisted par-
ticipantsfby organizing the ninth annual volunteer fair, which '
allows students to get information on a variety of communi-
ty service organizations, all in one place. -

Held on the Wlliarn Pitt Union’s patio and lawn
Thursday afternoon, the fair brought in organizations, rang-
ing from Goodwill Industries to the Foxwall Emergency
Medical Service, that displayed posters and handed out
brochures to  students of ﬂieir services. '

“If you have  to volunteer, you certainly should,” V

Driven bythe desire to bring good, into other people’s
lives, freshman Jacob Vanzin wandered through a maze of
booths and colorful posters, interspersed with blue and gold
balloons. _

Accompanying Vanzin in his quest were other Pitt stu-

Comic rubs newspapers the wrong way

The Pittsburgh Post—Gazette, along
with 18 other newspapers — out of 34
surveyed— took a hands-off approach
to public health when it decided not to
run a “Doonesbury” comic strip that
discussed the potential beneﬁts of mas-
turbation.

In Gary Trudeau’s comic, charac-
ters discuss a recent Australian study
that found that men who ejaculated
five or more times a week — whether
masturbating or otherwise — were 30
percent less likely to develop prostate
cancer than their less explorative
peers.

According to the Hartford Courant,
Trudeau uses the word “masturbation”
and the euphemism “se1f-dating,”
directly in reference to the study. No
logs are ﬂogged, nor chickens choked,
nor meats beaten. It’s definitely more
public service than Penthouse Forum.

Newspapers have editorial discre-
tion, and they alone should be able to
control their presses. Of the 34 sur-
veyed, 13 chose to run the comic, and
three were not sure.

Still, if they refused to print
comics that contain a word readily
found in a biology book or a dictionary
because children are not equipped to
handle its ramifications,_ they were
being silly. The comics page publishes
commentary on war, politics and race.
Why not health?

And seeing that they are exposed

to‘other “dangerous” words — see Sen.
Rick Santorum’s grocery-list of no-
no’s —— shouldn’t they also hear the
good things that arise from masturba-
tion? 0 ' ‘

Trudeau certainly didn’t write a
guide to wrist—strengthening exercises.
His comic was tasteful and timely. And
if it provides a public service, all the
better.

Leaving men blind about mastur-
bation will lead to a potentially hairy
situation. The American I j Cancer
Society reports that prostate cancer is
second only to skin cancer as the most
common type of cancer afﬂicting
American men.

New Scientist magazine reported
that masturbation could help to “ﬂush
out” the prostate, one of the glands that
makes the ﬂuid found in semen.

Of course, the Post—Gazette was
not alone in its decision. Trudeau’s
syndicate, Universal Press Syndicate,
offered another comic as an alternative
to “Doonesbury.”

This was also not Trudeau’s first
time getting pulled. Some of his other
banned works were featured at this
summer’s exhibit, “Too Hot to Handle:
Creating Controversy through Political
Cartoons” at the Andy Warhol
Museum.

Masturbation shouldn’t be too hot
to handle, and it’s disappointing that so
many newspapers don’t see it that way.

Nurses, drunks confuse gender identity

I am having an involuntary
identity crisis.

Specifically: Am I a man or a
woman?

I would say that I’m the latter,
but others might not readily agree
—— including the nurse who filled
out my birth certificate the day I
was born.

I should clarify, before your
imaginations bottle-rocket, that I
am female, with all the accompany-
ing parts -and mechanisms, and that
I have no male parts sticking out
anywhere that I’ve noticed.

So what could have led a nurse,

_ a trained professional, on the day of

’my birth, to confuse the nature of
my sex?

My name.

Hello, my nameis Christian.

Isn’t that a, guy’s
name? Well, I haven’t
heard that ten times
already today.

This apparently was
such a conundrum for
some nurse, in ‘some
hospital, somewhere in
.Minnesota 22 years ago,
that she took it upon her-
self to change the name
on my birth certificate to

. lungs, but such was not the case on

the night in question.

But I was performing on stage
in a Bertolt Brecht review, playing
a dominatrix—style cabaret per-
former. «

Throughout the performance, I
sauntered around on stage with my
long hair dyed black. Dressed in
skivvies and fishnets, I balanced
atop a pair of needlepoint heels.

After the performance, I left the
theater amid a crowd of people
looking for a bar that would them in
after last call.

It was cold outside (Minnesota,
eh?) and I was going through a
stage in my life during which I
thought nothing was more haute
couture than purple suede and
lavender; fake, fur applied to a-win-

ter coat. My stage make-
- up was stillon, and my
hair done up in far too
many pins.

To my surprise, two
guys turned to me.

_ One, wearing a
wide—eyed expression,
pointed his finger and, in
his loudest drunk whis-
per, said “Look man, it’s
a man!”

Christina. _
Thanks a lot.
The formal name change I

recently had to go through to

acquire a passport was well worth
her trouble. Right.

Oh, if only the confusion had
ended there. Not the case.

All mail and phone calls are
addressed’ to Mr. Christian. In pas-
sive—aggressive protest, I refuse to
open this type of mail. And I tell the
inquiring person on the phone "that
Mr. Christian is unavailable.

I do believe there is still a cer-
tain army recruiting officer sta-
tioned in Hopkins, Minn., sitting at
his desk, calling my parents house
at regular intervals to see if their
son, Christian, is interested .in serv-
ing his country.

Their son respectfully declines
the invitation. V

To be honest, I’m used to the
confusion, and, believe" it or not,
find it amusing.

But one night, I was thrown a
bit off kilter by a couple of guys,
who were not only convinced I was
a man, but also that I was a man in

Now, I have been known to

I looked over my shoulder and
found only a wall. He was referring
to me. ’ ’

Now, as cool as I think drag
queens are — and I really do —
unfortunately, I cannot claim to be
one, no matter how much purple
leather and_ fake fur I may be wear-
ing. -
—I opened my mouth, taken

aback. I couldn’t think of a thing to-

say.

I was not a drag queen; I was a
girl.

Up until this moment, no one
had made such a claim about my
identity based on my my appear-
ance My ill—fitting name’ always
seemed to be the only issue.

It is a rather odd feeling to be
labeled as something you are not.

I’m sure others can attest to
this.

Credit card companies, sales-
people and my gynecologist take
note, I am setting the record

"straight: this Christian — drum roll,

please — is not a Mr.

BUCKLEY AMENDMENT

The Federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, commonly called the “Buckley Amendment”, is designed to
protect the privacy of students. it requires the University to comply with the following principles:

Student records are open for inspection by students upon request. Speclllc documents which students have
waived their right to inspect remain conﬁdential.

Students have a right to challenge the accuracy of records and to request that they be amended.

The institution may not release student records outside the institution without student consent, unless one of
several exceptions applies.

Requests from outside the institution for information regarding students should be documented, as should
releases of student infonnatlon.

Students have the right to ﬁle a complaint with the US Department of Education conceming alleged failures by
the University to comply with the requirements of the Buckley Amendment.

Students have a right to obtain a copy of the University policy regarding the Buckley Amendment. "it may be
obtained in 220 Thackeray Hail. .

The University may establish categories of infonnatlon known as ‘Directory infonnation" and release this
information without student consent, upon request by individuals external to the institution. Students may
request that the categories below be excluded from “Directory lnfonnation" that would be released without
student consent, upon request by a third party. . .

The University may forward education records to other educational agencies or institutions that have
requested such records and in which a student seeks or intends to enroll. _

Directory infonnation includes the following information:

Name

Address

Phone number and electronic mail address

Major field of study

Achievements, degrees, academic awards, or honors
Weight and height, ifa member of athletic teams
Participation in officially recognized activities and sports
Dates of attendance

Student's photograph

When the Oiiice of the University Registrar receives a student's refusal to permit the release of ‘Directory information," no
further disclosures are made without that student's written consent (except to parties who have legal access to student
records without written consent). Rescinding of this action can be done by the student submitting the request in writing to
the Ofﬁce of the University Registrar. Note that the following procedures apply:

1.

Students may review their education records by submitting a written request to the Record Custodlanln the
appropriate University unit. A listing of those University oiﬁces which routinely possess education records

Dickie Roberts, 8

Sitting at the bar of Fuel and Puddle a few
days ago, I was having a conversation with a’
friend about nothing in particular. At one point, I
mentioned Richard Simmons, ‘80s health guru
extraordinaire and creator of the “Sweatin’ to the
Oldies” series, in a sort of joking way, and we
laughed before moving on to the next topic.

But .a few minutes later, I felt a tap on my
shoulder. I- swiveled around on the bar stool to
see a woman standing behind me, asking, “Do
you like Richard Simmons?” '

I don’t think I have to tell anybody that talk-
ing about Richard Simmons, or, rather, being
asked if you’re a fan of the man, isn’t exactly
normal bar conversation.

Even though the woman that asked me if I
liked Simmons followed that up with something
along the lines of “Do you sweat to the oldies?,”
she had a reason for asking me about the fitness
magnate.

According to her and the man she was with,
Richard Simmons was spotted at Club
Chemistry, a dance club in the Strip District, by
their own four eyes, sweating to the sounds of
the ‘80s music that the club plays, two Saturdays
ago.
It bears reiteration — Richard Simmons was
at a club in Pittsburgh. Imagine the shock you’d
feel if you saw this guy dancing the way the
woman at Fuel said he was: intensely, maybe
grinding, in a section of the club where there’s a
handrail, his legs darting and ﬂailing about.
Then compound that shock with that of going
over to talk to him, like this woman and her guy-
friend claimed to have done, and finding out that

Assistant A & E Editor

I will talk about whenever, wherever, with

whomever. It was an interesting run-in, odd, to
say the least, but interesting nonetheless. Plus, it
was nice to have a conversation with people who
share the same enthusiasm for the decade of
excess as I do — these strangers were as excited
hearing about my recent purchase of a Member’s
Only jacket as I was when I bought it.

But I would be lying if I said the notion of
Richard Simmons prowling the club scene in the
Strip District didn’t gnaw at my mind the rest of
that night and through most of the next day.

Maybe the woman was telling a tall tale.’

Maybe she met someone who looked like
Richard Simmons and, when she approached the

poser, he fed her and her guy friend a line. Or

Needless to _

  Richard Simmons looks for chemistry inthe Strip

maybe she did see him and did have a conversa-
tion with him and he does, in fact, go clubbing in
the Strip District on a regular basis. It’s possible.
I haven’t seen him on any television programs

recently, and, to my knowledge, he hasn’t-

released any new fitness tapes in a while.

What if it was him that was at Club
Chemistry? Could Pittsburgh be turning into a
haven for — dare I say — washed-up ‘80s stars?
Hell, we have a Boy George Day here. It’s true.
City Council declared Oct. 1 Boy George Day
three years ago when the former lead singer of
Culture Club came to play a show here. He was
given the honor of having a day of his own in
Pittsburgh because he got his act together and

Web site for “Boy George” and you’ll find the
story.

But if, in fact, da ‘Burgh is becoming a place
where ‘8'Os stars are making a place for them-
selves, maybe city leaders can run with that for a
way to market our city. I

“Pittsburgh: Karaoke to your favorite ‘80s

Here’s what I propose: Any regulars of Club
Chemistry, or any club in the city, keep an eye
out for Richard Simmons. If youcan, smuggle a
camera into the club and get your picture taken
with him, or take a picture of him, whatever
works. Send it to me at The Pitt News and,
together, we’ll get to the bottom of this Case of
the Clubbing Richard Simmons.

Journalists over Baghdad

Just as the Vietnam War impacted
the music of the time, so has the war in
Iraq affected current music.

Just a short while ago, if you turned
on any cable news channel — CNN,
Fox News or even The Disney Channel
— you could expect to hear, “U.S.
troops captured the city of...” or per-
haps, “Today, Iraqi Republican Guard
forces...”

Now, just a few months later, the
news channels have pared back their

coverage of the war because, well, the

war is essentially over. Baghdad has
been captured, thus Iraq most often
makes it into today’s headlines only
when an American soldier is killed. For
the most part, the reporters have gone
home, as have many of the protesters.

If one man in Pittsburgh gets his
way, however, there may soon be .a few
more journalists in Iraq.

Vincent Scotti Eirene plans to ﬂy to
Iraq, along with a news crew from his
Web radio station, Blast Furnace Radio,
to ask for forgiveness from the Iraqi
people. In addition, Eirene plans on
filming and reporting the ongoing sto-
ries coming out of Iraq, such as the
health of the Iraqi people, that he thinks
aren’t being covered by the major
media.

What does this all have to do with
Arts & Entertainment? In order to get to
Baghdad, Eirene needs money. This

weekend, he will be holding the Music
Without Borders benefit show to raise
money for the Night Flight to Baghdad.

The Concert For Peace, as it is also
called, will feature several native
Pittsburgh performers. Eccentric jazz
singer/entertainer Phat Man Dee will be
making an appearance, as will funk-
jazz—fusion band Ouve and alternative-
rock band The Cuff. The show will also
feature Chris Serra, a new face to the
Pittsburgh music scene.

Even if you aren’t interested in
world affairs, this all—ages show has
something for everyone. And you get
the satisfaction of contributing to a
great cause while being entertained.

The Concert for Peace will take
place tomorrow, Sept. 6, at 9 p.m. Cost
is $7. For more information or direc-
tions contact the Quiet Storm at (412)
661-YELL.

 

Child stars: this is your future

Dickie Roberts, 6

roles and they’re not that funny

V when they do appear.

What makes this movie go from
a mediocre comedy. to something
actually worth seeing is the chem—
istry between David Spade‘ and the
two young actors that play the chil-
dren of the family he’s hired. Their
obvious enjoyment of the funny mis-
takes that their “adopted brother”
Dickie makes while trying to be a
kid — from sliding on a waterless
slip-n—slide to ﬂipping over parked
cars while learning how to ride a
bike — helps the audience enjoy
these mishaps as well. Andit doesn’t
hurt that Spade is at his funniest dur-
ing these family interactions.

The story is not entirely realistic,
but it’s not supposed to be. Knowing
this makes.the movie fun to watch.
Since the relationships between the
characters are what drive the plot,
some scenes fall short because what
happens next is too obvious or
slightly unbelievable, based on what
we know about those characters.
Despite these minor pitfalls, there’s
always a scene afterward that moves

the film forward again so the humor
doesn’t completely lose its momen-
tum.

There are more cameos in
“Dickie Roberts” than in an “Austin
Powers” movie, only the cameos
aren’t done by A-list celebrities, but
rather by former child stars from the

v‘,50s through the ‘90s. This is proba- A

bly more impressive to those who
actually know who these “stars” are.
Otherwise, stick around during the
credits to shed some light on the
mystery. But, even while unsure of
who these people are, the cameos
add to the movie by enhancing the
parody of life after childhood fame.
And - seeing Screech (Dustin
Diamond) from “Saved by the Bell”
with a beard is always a plus.
Overall, “Dickie Roberts” is a
funny, cute movie with plenty of
laugh-out-loud moments and only a
few dull spots. David Spade brings
his usual style of humor with a fam-
ily-film twist that, for the most part,
works. The message at the end is
really sweet, if obvious. Don’t forget
to stay for some last laughs during
the credits. This movie is definitely
not a bad way to spend an afternoon.

Harris decides not  
to start Rutherford   

RYAN WALKER
Staff Writer

The.Panthers will begin to answer two key ques-
tions this Saturday night when they open their season
againstKent State. First, how much of an effect will
Rod Rutherford’s off-the-ﬁeld incident have on the
team? And second, will Pitt ‘be able to live up to all of
the preseason expectations?

After Rutherford’s alleged altercation, thevquarter-

 back position is clouded with controversy. Harris
' announced at Thursday’s practice that Rutherford

would not start in Saturday’s game.

“I have arrived at a disciplinary decision regarding
Rod,” Harris said. “Other than announcing Rod will not
start the first game of his senior year at home, though I
do expect him to play, I will not disclose the other dis-
ciplinary actions I have taken.”

VV1th Rutherford not starting, it is likely that red-
shirt freshman Luke Getsy will make his first collegiate
start. Getsy was named the backup quarterback on
Tuesday. .

Pitt enters the 2003 season with the most preseason
recognition tl1ey’ve had since Walt Harris became head
coach in 1997. Pitt returns 18 total starters from last
year’s 9-4 team and. is currently ranked No. 12 in the
USA Today/ESPN" poll and No. 10 in the Associated
Press poll.

Harris felt that, in the past, the team was not receiv-
ing the credit it deserved, but ‘this year,that’s all
changed. . . ' g ,

The key to success for

be stopping Kent State
quarterback Joshua
Cribbs, who will attempt
to become the first player
in Division I-A history with threeconsecutive “double-

Cribbs has both rushed and thrown for 1,000 yards.

While Cribbs averaged 7.7 yards per carry last sea-

14 interceptions, completing just 48 percent of his pass-

Porter’s visit to practice should be encouraging for team

I heard the most ridiculous nrmor on the
face of this earth the other day from a friend.
He told me that the shot that was ﬁred
into the buttocks of Pittsburgh Steelers line-
backer Joey Porter late Saturday night was a

setup. He went on to explain that Porter’s «

backup, Clark Haggans, who was reportedly
with Porter earlier the night of the shooting,
had something to do with the shooting, hav-
ing been motivated by jealous rage and
wanting to take Porter’s starting position.
Haggans is rumored to be starting in
place of the injured Porter in this week’s
opener against the Baltimore Ravens. He

.will temporarily ﬁll the shoes of Porter,

which cements his alleged motive, but to

believe such an out-
landish theory is
absurd ‘

The fact that a
human" mind created
such cynical gossip
absolutely boggles my
mind. Unfortunately, in
the world of sports,
there are outsiders who .
make up these ridiculous statements and
have these theories without having a clue as
to what really goes on in sports.

I also heard that Porter should was shot

Sunday’s opener.

« What Porter and
Haggans, or any ath-
lete, for that matter, do
in their V spare time
should not impact
judgment as to where a
player and team stand
on the ﬁeld. I couldn’t care less where Porter
got shot and why he was where he was.

Personally, as a football fan, I am entire-
ly more worried about when he will retum to

Students will be required to present their Pitt ID at the check in before

But for the record, Porter _, had every
good reason to be where he was in Denver
Saturday night. His weekend trip revolved
around‘ watching his former college team,
Colorado State, play its season opener, an act
of a classy guy who has enough money to
afford such luxury.

The fact that he went to a sports bar after
the game to have a drink with some ﬁiends
is no more improper than you or me hitting
up the South Side or the Strip District for a
cocktail or seven.

It’s what we do. A

He’s young, wealthy, successful and,
most importantly, human. What Porter was
doing that night was nothing more ﬂian
many athletes, celebrities and ordinary peo-
ple do: drinking, socializing and having fun.

Porter is a classy guy. Going to see his
former college play a game is nothing short
of a class act

What is even more impressive, and
what. makes me more optimistic about his
return, is the fact that Porter showed up at the
Steelers,-' practice Wednesday afternoon.
Surprising his teammates and walking with
only a slight limp, he came to prove to the
team that he’s going to be okay and tell them
to move on and focus on this week’s game.

Such a gesture,‘an inspirational moment

fortheteam,willlifttheSteelersthisweekW

and make the team stronger as a whole.

Porter just so happened to be in the
wrong place at the wrong time, the victim of
a lot of bad luck. But the fact that he will
soon recover is nothing short of a miracle,
andonethatlthinkwillmakehimabetter
player and create a better team.

I have a funny feeling about the Steeler

‘defense shutting out the Ravens this week,

without Joey Porter. This may turn out to be
the best thing that happened to the team as
the season progresses, and the only ones

hurting from Porter’s gunshot wound will be

Pittsburgh’s opponents.

difficult, you know, because I don’t think
we’ve seen one quite as athletic‘ in the
spread offense,” Harris said. ,

Since the Panthers have not played a
game yet, they were not permitted to
scout Kent State in their season opener
last week.

“We couldn’t be at the game, we

couldn’t see the tape,” Harris said. “You

talk about a tough assignment; they
already have a game under their belt.”
Pitt’s offense still has a number of
weapons to utilize against Kent State’s
defense. Brandon Miree was a late
bloomer last season, but ﬁnished strong
with a Most Valuable Player’ perfor-
mance in the Insight Bowl. '
“We want to become a team that can

~ . be dominant at the line of scrimmage and

have a 1,000 yard rusher, and we’re
excited about having Brandon Miree as

 

   
   

our tailback,” Harris said.

Larry Fitzgerald, who pulled his
hamstring during training camp, has
fully recovered.

Playing receiver opposite him will
be Princell Brockenbrough, a junior-col-
lege transfer who redshirted last year
after undergoing knee surgery.
Brockenbrough caught 20 touchdown
passes in his two seasons at City College
of San Francisco.

The Panthers can also look to John
Mackey award candidate Kris Wilson for
offensive production. Wilson has started
in 29 consecutive contests and has aver-
aged 17.8 yards per catch in his three-
year career at Pitt.

Saturday’s game will provide the
Panthers with their first test of what
could be a memorable season.

“Our football players know what’s at
stake, and we’re gonna try to get it done
the best way we know how,” Harris said.

Van Pelt, Martin lead Panthers to win

Greatest, page 9

not matter, as Van Pelt hit Jermaine
Williams on a short swing pass, which the
backup tailback ran the rest of the way for
a 77-yard touchdown. It tied the third-
longest play in Pitt history and gave Pitt a
21-3 lead.

The next Panther drive did not take
much longer. Van Pelt underthrew Dietiich
Jells, who had gotten behind the Kent

V defense, but the sophomore wide receiver

made an outstanding catch for a 45-yard
gain.

Martin completed the drive with a 17-
yard touchdown run.

Disasters on the Kent punting team set
up two more scores. First, the Kent punter
put his knee down while ﬁelding a, snap,
giving Pitt the ball at Kent’s 11.

Vince Williams went in from the one-
yard line to make the score 35-3, Pitt.

Cliﬁ Moncrief blocked Kent’s next
punt, setting up a one-yard run by Martin
to run the count to 42-3.

Kent made a bit of a 11m early on the
ﬁrst drive of the third quarter, driving 72

yards in 15 plays and seven minutes end- .

ing in a one-yard touchdownrun by quar-
terback Kevin Shuman.

“[Kent coach Pete Cordelli should be
commended for] his ability to prepare his
team to open the second half,” Hackett
said. “He did a better job than I did. We
were not ready for the second half. His

football team clearly was ready.”

Kent drove to the Pitt 33-yard line on
its next possession, but Shuman fumbled a
botched option play and Gerald Simpson
recovered for the Panthers to end Kent’s
last scoring threat of the game.

Passes from Van Pelt to Coons for 15
yards and Jells for 41 yards set up another
Pitt touchdown, this one a Martin dive
from the one. Pitt’s ﬁnal score came on a
31-yard ﬁeld goal by Conley.

Pitt racked up the kind of numbers
expected in a game against an opponent
like Kent. Van Pelt hit on 11 of 17 passes
for 270 yards and three touchdowns.

Martin ran for 80 yards and three
touchdowns on 18 carries and caught a
pass for another score.

Tumulty was the defensive standout
before the injury, with nine tackles, all in
the ﬁrst half. His replacement, Hayes
Clark, had eight stops.

Pitt had a shaky day on special teams.
They had penalties on two punt returns,
muffed another and failed on an extra
point. They got a strong game from
Conley, the senior, walk—on kicker.

“Conley did what we hoped he would
do,” Hackett said. “The kickoffs were just
what we needed and the PATs and ﬁeld
goal‘were solid.”

Pitt won big against a team they
should beat by a large margin, but it was
not a total success, with the loss of a key
defensive player like Tumulty.
