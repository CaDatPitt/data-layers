itt group hosts conference on, Middle East

Amy Friedenberger
Staﬂ“Wri ter

For Pitt student Shafeek Jamous, the “I <3
the Middle East” conference demonstrated

that people still care about peace and that ,

goodness still exists in a world that some-
times seems too radicalized.

“I see hope,” he said during the week-
end-long event. “If we here can’t make the
change, we can at least make the hope for
change.” ' '

One Life One World One Peace, a human-
rights advocacy group at Pitt, hosted the
three—day “I <3 the Middle East” confer-
ence over the weekend at various locations
around campus. .

During a series of workshops, students

from Pitt, SUN Y Geneseo, Allegheny Col-
lege and Carnegie Mellon University relayed
personal experiences from the Middle East

and shared research projects in the hopes '

of educating those who attended about a
region that is often surrounded by stereo-
types.
Topics ranged from “terror” rhetoric to
Palestinian refugee rights in Lebanon.
Eric Reidy, the director of One Life One
World One Peace, was inspired to present
the series at Pitt after he attended the ﬁrst
“I <3 the Middle East” conference at SUNY
Geneseo.
Reidy said he was drawn to the con-

ference’s title not only because it was con- -

troversial, but because it could promote
discussion about some of the negative and
limited Middle East coverage prominent in
the mainstream media.

“There has been a profoundly disturb-
ing sentiment unleashed upon the Middle
Eastern community,” Reidy said. “We want
to move beyond that simplistic view.”

Reidy’s group had been planning the
conference since February.

Allegheny College’ student Annie Krol
did a presentation on birth-control policy
and options in modern Iran. She gained an
interest in the Middle East when she took
an introductory course on the subject. I-Ier
professor for Gender and Sexuality in the
Islamic World suggested that she take her
interest to the conference.

Pitt student Jonas Moffat conducted a
presentation called, “Queer and Loathing in
the Middle East.” He talked about his year-
and-a-half experience traveling through
Egypt, Israel and Palestinian territories.

Moffat also spoke about his experiences
at the 2006 Tel Aviv “Queeruption,” an an-
nual festival and gathering of queer and
gay men that has been held in various cities
around‘ the world.

During his travels, Moffate interviewed
gay fashion designers in Cairo for a women’s
interest magazine and worked at extrava-
gant parties for one of Egypt’s biggest party
planners.

SUNY Geneseo student Brent Siegel
talked about his time as a camp counselor
at Seeds of Peace, a nonpartisan, secular

organization based in Maine that seeks to ‘

connect people from regions in conﬂict.

“It creates this experience of living with '

people they no longer consider enemies,”
Siegel said. “You have Palestinians living
in bunks with Israelies.”

But Siegel said that the summer camp
has its difficult moments: A young camper
from Israel once walked. up to Siegel and
told him that she didn’t want her friends
in Gaza to die.

4 The conference began Friday night with
an opening discussion in the Cathedral of
Learning and a trip to the Waffle Shop on
South Highland Avenue in East Liberty.
Some attendees ate Iranian sandwiches
from the Conﬂict Kitchen, which operates
next door. '

The Conﬂict Kitchen serves cuisine from

countries in conﬂict with the United States.

It began serving Iranian food four months 4

ago and is currently making the transition
to Afghani food. ~
Kubideh, the Conﬂict Kitchen’s only
dish, is served in freshly baked barbari
bread with onion, mint and basil. The food
is wrapped in paper printed with personal

interviews with Iranian people about their .

experiences with different aspects of Ira-
nian life.

“The Conﬂict Kitchen has a greater
agenda than providing dialogue,” said Dawn
Weleski, one of the founders of the kitchen.
“It’s more political.”

Reidy said that going to the Waffle Shop
and Conﬂict Kitchen was a good introduc-
tion to the restof the conference because
it presented the idea of a country that is
misunderstoodlin an educational format.

The ﬁrst “I <3” conference took place at
SUNY Geneseo in the fall of 2009 through
the efforts of Geneseo junior Nick LaGrassa

and his work as the president of another.

Geneseo campus group, Invisible Chil-
dren. d" -
LaGrassa said he realized the impor-

social activities Friday evening.

tance of student engagement in humanitar-
ian conﬂicts-occurring in the Middle East
and other troubled areas of the world after

' a sleepless tripto Washington, D.C., for a

conference on violence in Uganda.

After almost two days without sleep and
traveling home in a car, LaGrassa realized
the magnitude of these issues and how
others like him had the ability to initiate
change. i

“We are in school to absorb knowledge
and use those resources provided to take
action,” LaGrassa said. '

By the fall of that same year, Invisible
Children started the ﬁrst “I <3 Africa” con-
ference at SUNY Geneseo. ’

“I <3 the Middle East” is the second in
the “I <3” series. ‘ '

The conferences are entirely student

' planned and presented. LaGrassa said that

the format allows for the dialogue to match
the younger generation and for students to
develop a conﬁdence in providing their own
resources to create a change.

“What I would like people to take away
is for them to move away from the textbook
and toward the podium,” LaGrassa said]

Hands off, TSA  

Flying home for Thanksgiving? Prepare to

choose between a controversial Advanced —

Imaging Technology (AIT) -screening and
a rather thorough pat down. '

. According to CNN, an increasing num-
ber of pilots and passengers are revolting
against the Transportation Security Ad-
ministration’s' full—body scanning and what
many consider intrusive pat downs.

Although the radiation emitted by the
scanners presents health concerns, some
passengers worry more about their right
to privacy. 1 "

The TSA scanners have been referred
to as “porno” scanners and,“Virtual strip-
searches” by their critics.

As for the new body searches, The Wash-
ington Post reports that “the examinations
routinely involve the touching of breasts

and genitals” and “entail a sliding hand -

motion on parts of the body where a lighter
touch was used before.” ,

Though these measures wouldn’t pre-
vent us from ﬂying, taking these safety pre-

cautions any further would undoubtedly

lead to a lowering of U.S. citizens’ quality L

of life, all because of fear. If we fear ter-
rorism so much that we are hypothetically
willingto strip down in an airport, there’s
a problem. ’ I .

' Some feel the measures have already
gone too far. Thewashington Post report-

ed that the website for a group called “We '

Wo'n’t'Fly” has received more 70,000 hits
a day since going online a week ago. Ac-
cording to The Post, it “asks passengers
to say no to scans and pat—downs and for
TSA to remove its ‘porno—scanners’ and
‘grope_rs.”’

But a USA Today/ Gallup poll ﬁnds that 78
percent of respondents‘ said they approve
of using the scanners even if the machine
compromises privacy.

' According to the TSA website, 65 major

airports currently use the AIT screening — ‘

including Pittsburgh International Airport

' and Philadelphia International Airport.

Overall, we support scan»ning.;:

A MIDWESTERN PIECE

Republicans need to

Mark Kozlowski
Columnist

The President, winning by a convincing
margin just two years ago, has lost a great
dealof popularity since those elections that
gave the party not only the White House,
but also solid working majorities in both
houses of Congress. Abuse is hurled at the
president’ daily, and his approval ratings
are sagging. The public is angry about
government spending and the culture of

Washington. The opposition, previously"
_ divided and in the political wilderness,

has made a comeback and throttled the
president’s party in the midterm elections.
While one side celebrates, the other, in a

state of shock andconfusion, retires to,

lick its wounds.

It wasn’t pleasant being a Republican
after the elections of 2006. In Novem-
ber 2008, the Republicans were further
trounced by President Barack Obama and
the Democrats. At that time, I recall many
conﬁdent predictions that this was going
to be a “permanent Democratic majority,”
that the Republicans were condemned to
become a rump party. Nobody supported
them, we were told: Latinos, women, young

folks, old folks, middle—aged folks were all
voting Democrat. The Economist said the
Republicans had lost the.West, a large base
of support, and were going to be relegated
to being a Southern regional party. This
meant possible extinction —- the Federal-
ists were a similar regionalrump party out
of touch with the American public.

But that’s not what happened. Four short
years after 2006, the situation has reversed
itself, with the Republicans ascending and
the Democrats indisarray. These last elec-
tions saw Republicans gain the most House
seats the party has hadsince the 1940s, and
a lot of these gains occurred in the Midwest,
where Republicans were largely written off
just four years ‘ago. Massachusetts elected
a Republican to the Senate in an earlier
by—election. '

Much as I am glad that the Republicans
won a smashing triumph in the House elec-
tions on Nov. 2nd and did quite well in other
races too, I am careful to note that political

power tends to be a temporary thing in _

this country.
When Republicans celebrate the inaugu-
ration of a new Congress and a Republican

speaker, they should keep this in mind. The _

GOP still isn’t popular, and the GOP estab-
lishment is disliked by Tea Party groups,
the very groupsthat helped the Republican

act likeRepublicans

sweep occur. A similar electoral triumph
‘ for the Republicans in 1994 ended with 

Bill Clinton’s re-election in 1996. I hope
A somebody whispersin the Speaker’s ear
“Remember, Caesar, thou art mortal.”

The Republicans need to get it right if
they hope to pick up more seats in 2012.
First, they should push a legislative agenda
of their own, not just act in opposition to
the president. Finding popular bills to pass
through the Houseand forcing the Demo-
cratic Senate and president to either stand
with or against them should be a priority,
as it would allow the Republicans to throw
the inevitable charge of “obstructionism”
back at the Democrats making it.

The Republicans also must not allow
themselves to be distracted with issues
that, although pressing, are not what they
were primarily elected on. A knock-down,
drag-out ﬁght over something like Don’t
Ask Don’t Tell would be bad as it would
distract from more pressing work that
needs to be done on the economy. Similarly,
arguments over things like school prayer
wouldn’t be good. Social issues in general
did not ﬁgure largely in the 2010 elections,
with the exception of health care. In the
words of Bill Clinton’s 1992 campaign: “It’s
the economy, stupid.”

A major peril the Republicans will have

to deal with is the very real possibility that
the Tea Party movement will be hijacked
by the GOP establishment. When some
of the candidates upon which the hope of
Change in Washington was resting turn
out to be typical politicians, those who
put them there, the energized Republican
base and independents, might very well
turn on them. This would have bad conse-
quences for 2012. Independents might shift
yet again, and Tea Partiers might just stay
home and sit out the next election, leading
not only to a reduced or Vanished House
majority, but a second Obama term. Long,
protracted, primary ﬁghts that might be
mounted by these semi-independent Tea
Party groups that would sap'GOP funds,
time, effort and enthusiasm would be no
less signiﬁcant a prospect.

Republicans also have to make sure to
act like Republicans. That means make an
effort to cut spending and taxes, pursue a
policy of peace through strength and turn
away from the sirens’ song of protectionism.
When they turn away from this brand name,
engage in massive spending, backroom
deals and pork-barrel projects, people get
disgusted and wonder what they’re voting
for when they vote Republican. And then
the catastrophe of 2006 repeats itself.

Songwriter pes

Larissa Gula
Staff Writer

Local songwriter Mike Stout works not
only as a musician, but also as an activist

“ and community leader.

In recent years, he’s worked on the
board with Just Harvest, an organization
that aims to end local hunger and poverty.
He’s collaborated with the Coalition Against
Offshore Drilling. And he’s gotten involved
in the attempt to bring affordable health-
care to Pennsylvania.

“I only sleep four hours a night,” he
said.

The people he works with on each proj-
ect are as enthusiastic as he is, but Stout’s
lack of sleep reveals just how much work
he is doing and how much there is to be
done with each project.

“There are dozens of people out there
willing to help,” he said. “Unfortunately,
we need hundreds.” -

Stout’s work often chronicles the stories
of people who, like him, have stood up to
authority. A

At a young age, in 1968, Stout played
anti—war and civil rights songs in New
York City, inspired by players like Bob
Dylan. When he joined the steel industry
and worked at Homestead Steel Works, he
was elected a union head grievance man.
The title wouldstay with him long after his
steel industry days because of a journalist’s
review in which he was called “the world’s
grievance man.”

“In the old steel mills people would reg- ‘

ister complaints with him and he would
take it up with management,” said Pa_ul
Carosi, a publicist with Radio Free Tunes
who assists with Stout’s music distribu-
tion online.

Stout worked in the steel industry for 20
years and used music to rally his co—workers
in the union, fighting for pensions and un-
employment beneﬁts within the workforce.
He went on to organize a benefit concert
that drew international press in an attempt
to combat foreclosures and unemployment
within the steel mill.

Stout said his experience in the industry
“affected my outlook in the sense that, as a
worker, you saw the need to see a manufac-
turing base. If it doesn’t provide decent jobs
for people, everything else goes downhill.
When you don’t have a manufacturing base
it isn’t long before you lose a center. Then
you have no jobs, and that’s what young
people will experience if things aren’t re-
versed.”

Stout went on to compose upwards of 10
new albums since then, writing in a mix-
ture of folk, rock and pop styles about his

experiences and the experiences of people
he finds interesting. He ﬁnanced the re-
cording of each album himself.

“I think 12 CDs by himself is more than
almost anyone else, even people with la-
bels,” Carosi said. “He just never quits.
He finishes one CD and writes more. And
he does it not because he’s become a big
star making money. He does it because
he believes in it all. He’s always going to
meetings and is always involved with ac-
tivities. He’s a busy guy. Even if you don’t
agree with him you have to admire [that]
he never quits.”

Stout said he writes about a mixture of
topics, but primarily creates “songs about
ordinary people we should remember.”

Carosi described those people as “he-

 

tunes about local

, roes who stoodijup for people.” And after

40 years of songwriting, the challenge isn’t
writing the music so much as telling the

. story.

“The stories are so deep and heavily
laden with facts and biography,” Stout
said. “Often it is difficult to tell as story
in a three- or four—minute song. But it’s
not difficult to write a song, so much as
the life story.”

Stout’s most recent songs focus on con-
temporary issues, such as “29 Miners Bur-
ied and Gone,” which tells of miners who
died following an explosion in the Upper
Big Branch Mine in West Virginia. He also
wrote a piece about the Marcellus Shale
environmental issue that has attracted
attention recently.

Songs that Stout writes “change my view
of Pittsburgh and American history,” Carosi
said. “Just hearing his music changed how
I look at things. If you read history, people
were protesting and people were killed, for
years. But I was taught growing up people
were loyal to their government.” ‘

Stout simply believes that people “have
to do what’s right” and that ignoring con-
temporary issues will only make problems
grow. He protested during the civil rights
movement and against the Vietnam War,
despite negative comments. . _

“Young people at Pitt have the energy
and passion, and enough brain left to go
out and change the world for the better,”
Stout said. “If you don’t now, you pay the
price later.”

Sports
Heat
won’t  
Wiﬂtiﬂe  
tis year

 

Sports Editor

LeBronJames took his talents to South Beach
to play for the Miami Heat this summer, but
those talents won’t be enough to lead his
team to an NBA championship —- at least
not this season. ’

Teamed up with fellow NBA All-Stars
Dwyane Wade and Chris ‘Bosh, the Heat were
a near’-consensus pick by most analysts to
win the league title, but if the ﬁrst few games
of this ‘season are an indication of things to
come, the Heat will come up short in the
playoffs.  . _ . ‘ ‘ ' ‘

Before the season, many wereasking
whether this year’s Heat team would chal-
lenge the 1995-96 team’s record for most
wins in a regular season after they went
72-10. , 4

But that goal is all but out the window
now, after they’re off to a pedestrian 6-4
start. ;_ ' .

Yes, the talent is there for the “Big Three”
to get hot in the postseason and win ‘a cham-

pionship, but it looks like they might be a_
year away from getting the chemistrythat

every great team needs.

Just because a team hassuperstars doesn’t
mean they’re automatically destined for
greatness. Just ask the,Cincinnati Bengals
who, after signing Terrell Owens to team up
with fellow receiver Chad Ochocinco, were a
trendy pick to make a postseason run.

V But two wins and seven losses later,
they’re looking at a top-10 draft pick this
year rather than a potential playoff push.

And when superstars don’t achieve the
success they expect, their egos come out.
You can almost set your watch to it.

James already complained that head coach
Erik Spoelstra is playing him and Wade too
much, leaving them too tired in the end of
games.

But when a team invests so heavily in
three players and comprises the rest of the
roster with players intended to essentially
take up space, why wouldn’t the coach lean
heavily on his stars?

James and Wade are accustomed to hav-
ing the ball in their hands late in games to
take the last shot, but now they seem con-
fused and indecisive in crunch time.

So far, Wade seems to be the guy to take
the shot when his team needs a basket, lead-
ing the team in scoring by a slim two points
per game overjames. _

The Heat certainly has superstars, but
they’re playing out of position.

James is essentially playing point guard,
a position where he has been effective, but

the Ospreys 95-49.

it’s not his natural position. Not only does
he have to create plays for himself, but now
he also has to create for others now as op-
posed to when he played small forward in
Cleveland.

Meanwhile, the Heat rely on Bosh to play
tough down low in the paint, though he’s
more effective facing the basket with more
of a ﬁnesse game.

So although the Heat have the talent to
raise the trophy in June, don’t count on it
for thisJune. ﬂ

After traveling to Pittsburgh having just
played Florida State in Tallahassee, Fla., at
9 p.m. the night before, the North Florida’s
men’s basketball team was at a major dis-
advantage against No. 5 Pitt.

The Ospreys (0-2) simply didn’t have
enough ﬁrepower — or energy — to knock
off the Panthers (3-0), as they fell 95-49
on Saturday.

“Obviously North Florida was in a tough

situation with the travel,” Pitt head coach
Jamie Dixon said in the post-game news
conference. “We were in a situation where
we caught them with travel. They were at a
bit of a disadvantage in that regard.”

Pitt got off to a quick start and never
looked back, leading 20-8 after only 10
minutes of action.

Five Pitt players scored in double ﬁg-
ures, led by J.J. Moore’s 19 points off the
bench. The Panthers bench scored 47 total
points 4 Moore’s big game proved an ex-
ample of that success. V

“It shows that we’re deep. Everybody

works, we see it in practice,” senior guard ’

Brad Wanamaker said in the news confer-
ence. “We know everybody can score but
we just came out today and our bench put
some big numbers up, andJ.J. showed what
he could do.”

The Panthers out-rebounded North
Florida 59-28.

The game was a homecoming for North
Florida head coach Matthew Driscoll who
got his ﬁrst coaching job at his alma mater,
nearby Northgate High School in 1988.

“It’s a special place, Pittsburgh, it really
is. The last time I was here they had just
tore down the stadium and they were just

‘making this particular [arena],” Driscoll

said.

The win marks Pitt’s 50th consecu-
tive home victory against nonconference
opponents. The Panthers’ next game is
Thursday against Maryland at Madison
Square Garden. I -

Columnist: Oliver Bateman

What Pitt News columnist Oliver Bateman
lacks in mustache he makes up for in muscle.
A Panther CrossFit enthusiast, the penman

of the Moustache Column of America ironi—_

cally likes to keep his face clean shaven.
Maybe he is afraid those pesky whiskers
will get in the way of his brawny ﬂash ﬁc-
tion and his razor—sharp wit. Whatever the
case, he hates Wikipedia, he gets his copy
in early and he always leaves his readers a
little bit more enlightened.

Local news personality: Julie Bologna
WPXI’s chief meteorologist sometimes
teaches school children about the weather,
science education and technology careers.
She’s been predicting weather since 1999,
working ﬁrst for WPXI, then a Texas tele-
vision station. She returned to the ‘burgh
and her position at WPXI about two years
ago. Even when the weather prediction isn’t
looking good, she can get you looking for-
ward to sunny days ahead. In Pittsburgh,
that takes some serious talent.

Local bartender: Gene Ney
The owner — and namesake —— of Gene’s

Place on Louisa Street graduated from Pitt
a little more than 10 years ago. Gene took
over the bar, originally called Denny’s, after
living above the place for several years. He
serves up choice brews and a steady dose of
alternative rock in one of Oakland’s most
boisterous areas. When not operating the
bar, he teaches at Carlow’s School of Busi-
ness and Technology Management.

Pittsburgh politician: Mayor Luke Ra-

Fair Share Tax ﬁasco aside, Mayor Luke
Ravenstahl has made a positive impact on

“Turn It Blue Day” for the city of Pittsburgh,
encouraging citizens to show their Panther
pride. Ravenstahl spent a year in Oakland

V as a Pitt student too, before transferring to

Washington &Jefl'erson College where he
kicked for the football team. Ravenstahl
still holds the record for the most consecu-

The Best Places

University building: The Cathedral of
Learning '

Reminding many students of Hogwarts, the
Cathedral of Learning is part of the Late
Gothic Revival in architecture and is deﬁ-
nitely the centerpiece of our campus. The
Commons Area serves as a favorite place
for students to study and also conveniently
houses a computer lab on the ground ﬂoor.
The historic landmark also features a Chick-
ﬁl-A. Come on, how many buildings on cam-
pus can say that? For a one stop shop for
food, coffee, class and studying, look no

if ‘ “further than the Cathedral.

Editors’ Pick: Heinz Chapel

Place to escape to: Schenley Park

Exams» got you down? Fight with the room-
mate? Hungover and bored? Schenley Park
is theperfect place to just get away from it
all for a while. Whether you lose yourself
while gazing at the stars over Flagstaff Hill
or hit the links fora round of golf, Schenley
offers hundreds of acres to let your mind
wander. If that just doesn’t do it for ‘you,
take a relaxing stroll around Panther Hollow
Lake or even just people watch for a minute
— everyone’s probably just as in need of a
vacation as you.

 ‘ Editors’ Pick: Panther Hollow

Place to study: Hillman Library

Hillman can barely be classiﬁed as a library.
There are lots of books, sure, but more than
stacks, this building is a forum, a coffee
shop, a nightclub and a hostel. While you

might have a hard time getting a table near
an outlet, Facebook probably isn’t aiding in
your studying anyway. And if you’re lucky,
Lady Gaga might show up during your study
session.

Editors’ Pick: Any grad school building

Place to do laundry: Towers

One day, not as far in the future as you might '

think, you won’t have the comfort of travel-
ing a mere 13 ﬂoors downstairs to load your
dirty underwear into Towers’ laundry room.
, You’ll have to walk your unment-ionables
down the street, sometimes in the snow,
and take them to the laundromat —— a place
where menin undershirts lurk to watch
young ladies bend over thewasher. At the
very least, you’ll have to walk down a rickety
set of steps into a mildewed South Oakland
basement to bleach those whites. Treasure
your Towers laundry room. Sit and watch
some TV to the comforting whir of your
University’s dryers. It only goes down from
here. .

Place to hook up: The Cathedral of Learn-

‘ Negb-Gothic architecture your thing? Yeah,
we didn’t think so.’ But readers say the Ca-

Professor Bob Atkin has a simple explaina-
tion for winning the hearts and votes of
Pitt News readers for this year’s “Best Of“
issue: “I care and it shows,” Atkin started
teaching at Pitt more than 20 years ago and
has instructed thousands of students in the
business school throughout his tenure. He

» even teaches his own recitationsfor closer 
interaction with his students. If that doesn’t

prove Atkin’s dedication, he spendshisfree
time at the University where you can ﬁnd
him day and night, usually tutoring and
talking to students.

Not every landlord will steam clean his
tenants’ carpets over Christmas break, but
not every landlord is Ron Levick. Levick

cery stores. Some say his apartments are

Schenley Quadrangle is a great place to
break up for several reasons. First of all,
it’s the perfect blend of public and private:
It’s an enclosed area that is often empty
throughout the day, but it’s also a central
campus location surrounded by eight of
Pitt’s 13 residence halls. So whether you
want your breakup to be intimate and per-
sonal or public and messy, the quad is the
place to do it. Plus, it provides you with
an opportunity to use a line that you know
you’ve always wanted to say: “We need to
talk. ‘Meet me in the quad.”

Just across the Schenley Park Bridge from
the Frick Fine Arts Building is a place that
features quiet, wooded areas, playgrounds,

gahela and more. Schenley Park is a won-
derful place to get away from the stresses
of day—to—day life by taking a walk: In the
park, it’s possible to take in sights of people
lolling on Flagstaff Hill or playing Frisbee.
As an added plus, you can alwaysobserve
the rather random outdoor statues inside
the park or listen to the percussion mu-

When the day just never seems to end and
a ﬁfth cup of coffee might put you into neu-
rogenic shock, the only place you want to
be is your bed. Sure, Soldiers 8: Sailors or
the Cathedral Lawn might be nice in good
weather, but who really wants to be run over
by a person chasing a Frisbee? Going to your
room, turning on sleep—inducing music by
The Fray, and getting some shut—eye for a
half an hour is a much better proposition.
And heck, if your little nap turns into a full-
out slumber, at least you’re in your bed.

When done in the wrong place, smoking
can be extremely boring. But that’s not the

What better way for you and your friends to

of pool? There’s no need to head out to the
bar anymore. Nordy’s Place, located on
the lower level of the Union, offers a hip
atmosphere with plenty of room so that
you’re not worried about passers-by every
time you shoot. The convenient location is
perfect for a game in between classes or at
night when you have some free time. Don’t
forget to grab a grilled cheese for charity
when FeelGood is there.

Schenley Quad is the place of residence for

a location for socializing and organizing
for the nine sororities who occupy it. A

David Lawrence is the best computer option
on campus. So bring your ﬂash drive, bring
your iPod and bring your friends for moral
support, because that unﬁnished 20—page

Just don’t BYOB. Alas, beverages, includ-

is there’s never a guest list —— assuming
you’re a Pitt student —— and it’s free entry
for girls and guys. But unless you want to

Best place to study abroad: Italy _

A Pitt student can only eat so many $5 pizzas
before his palate becomes eager for some-
thing higher-brow. All right, so studying
abroad in Italy just to eat pizza might be
extreme, but the country offers a lot more
than genuine pies. Florence’s museums make
it an art lover’s dream city. Rome’s histori-
cal signiﬁcance and volume of sights and
attractions would take this whole issue to
explain. And as for Venice, seeing police

/and taxi boats is aspectacle in itself. On

the down side, it’s common to have to pay
to use public bathrooms in Italy. That, and
it might be tough to go back to other pizzas
upon your return.

Two of Pitt’s largest lecture courses — with
enrollments sometimes topping 300 people
-- tied for this year’s title. Psychology delves
into the basics of the discipline, covering
how growing minds develop, how neuro-
logical disorders work and just generally
what makes people do what they do. History
ofjazz follows the evolution of what’s called
the most American form of music from its
beginnings as working-class tunes all of the
way up to concert music. As a plus, if you

their prices are sometimes higher, Mel-

Hours of practice and hard work has paid
off in multiple national championships for
Pitt’s cheer squad, and this year, Pitt stu-

them the best organization with Pitt spirit.
At football and basketball games, Pitt’s ever-

and rooting for our teams, even when the

Pitt’s chapter of Rainbow Alliance provides

The Pitt men’s basketball team has made its
way onto the list of the most elite basket-

ball programs in the nation. The Panthers
reached No. 4 in some 2010-11 preseason
rankings and are the favorite to win the Big
East after last year’s surprising success in
what was supposed to be a “rebuilding year.”
Guards Brad Wanamaker and Ashton Gibbs
look to lead the Panthers’ backcourt this
year, with Gary McGhee holding down the
paint as always. Once again the men’s bas-'
ketball players look to exceed the already
high expectations for them.

With sweet ﬂow and lenty of personality,
these ﬁne gents could easily have won the
category for most chill, had it been on the
ballot. A club sport since 1983, the men’s
lax team receives a much deserved nod, as
their efforts on and off the ﬁeld have earned
them the prestigious award of best men’s
club team. With any luck, they will ride out
the good vibes from this award through the
winter and into a winning spring season.

 
 
 

Two parallel streets, both one—way yet run-

fun really begins when you tell the fresh-
men to walk to the intersection of the two
streets.

It’s the song that makes wins even better

Through participation in campus Greek
events like Greek Sing, the brothers of the
Sigma Chi fraternity have donated time
and money to charitable causes multiple
times. The Children’s Miracle Network and
Huntsman Cancer Institute are just a few of

help. This past year, the brothers of Sigma
Chi took home _ﬁrst place along with the

sisters of the Delta Zeta sorority at Greek
Sing.

The sisters of Chi Omega won best sorority
for the second year in a row. Dedicated to

the raising money and awareness for the

Make-A—Wish Foundation, this sorority has
devoted itself to charitable causes, both on

Omega organization in 18 95 at the Univer-
sity of Arkansas and it has since grown to

more than 170 chapters and membership

equivalent to a medium-sized city.

It’s not surprising that students voted free
buses as the best perk that the University
offers. With nothing more than their Pan-
ther Card on them, Pitt students can go to
the Waterfront, South Side, Squirrel Hill,
Monroeville or Downtown on a lazy Sunday

Unlike Oakland’s Jester’s Court, this shop
