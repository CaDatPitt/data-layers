Assistont chancellor. ‘vows’ future protection

‘Gong’ ossoults six

Outside union building

Life as a student at Pitt is not always a lot of good times.

Based in an urban environment. Pitt comes into direct contact with
persons outside the books bought for classes. In the past year. this di-
rect contact has been increased—in the form of assaults on students.
both male and female.

History has recorded many such incidents on campus. but an inci-
dent last Friday night after a dance has sparked the student voice into
asking for more security protection on campus (see a student's state-
ment on this page).

No one has been seriously injured . . . yet. But it is literally unsafe
for a beau and his girl to walk about the campus. Administrators say

something should be done (see another statement on this page).

According to Capt. Charles Ray, superintendent of security forces.
"the security forces are being increased constantly. as able men are
available for recruitment and thus be around.“

But the question asked Friday night—by about a dozen students-
was: where was the protection when it was needed?

According to Capt. Ray six persons were assaulted by a gang out-
side the Student Union Building late Friday night. ~

He indicated that more people may have been harassed. but that
there was.no official report on them. He said two male students were
taken to the hospital; both were

To the University community:

As many ‘of you are aware. an unfortunate
incident involving an unprovoked attack on sev-
eral University students by non-students took
place in front of the Student Union last Friday
evening after a BAS sponsored dance. My of-
fice has taken steps to prevent this type of
thing from occurring in the future.

Since Friday I have met with members of
the University staff and faculty and related to
them the events of Friday evening and im-
pressed upon them the gravity of this matter.
I feel certain. after talking with many stu-
dents and staff. that they will assume more re-
sponsibility in preventing this sort of thing
from happening again. I have been informed
that the people responsible were not students
at the University. We are working with civil
authorities to see if these people can be appre-
hended.

We have met with the Campus Security
Services and have reviewed with themthe re-
ports by the students who were attacked and
criticized the lack of involvement by the Cam-
pus Security officers. I think the Campus Se-
curity Services have felt a lack of proper sup-

their function as Campus Security officers.’ ‘ 
‘ The Security Department has been assured by 
me that they can depend upon the Student Af-‘ 
fairs area for backing in whatever necessary . g. 
action they must take, and they will be expect-L  
ed to respond to any student in need os assis- A  I‘

tance .

I certainly do not condone what took place  

last weekend. I can assure you that I will per-
sonally take whatever steps that are neces-

sary to prevent this sort of thing from hap» 

pening again. I am requesting the Dean of Stu-
dents to convene the University Social Com-

mittee to review the priviledges of non-student)  A
guests in the Student Union and University . 

Residence Halls. Pending the review of these
social rules. only students and their guests,
faculty and staff shall be permitted in the resi-

dence halls and Student Union. To effect this,   .
the Campus Security Servi‘ce,s.-.T_rnay need at. 

times to ask personnel in‘-*Ifa‘ci_lities for  
their University identification cards in accord-. If 

ance with existing policy. I shall »a-'s‘k'.‘all mem- A it

bers of the University community to cooper- A
ate with them.

treated, but not admitted.

Ray said that two patrolmen
were on duty inside the Union for
the dance that night. A normal pa-
trol was on duty in the Towers, the
Quadrangle, and about the cam-
pus, he said. He did not elaborate

further.

“The men in the building (Un-
ion) were trying to clear the thing
(dance)/’ he said. “Things hap-
pen like this. It’s one of those
things that spring up.

"The incident probably eman-
ated from outside the University."
he said. "It can be duplicated
again.

“The underlying cause of these
things is the open door policy
around here. Everyone’s welcom-
ed,” he said.

However, Ray did say that
very serious consideration” by
top adminstrators may help to
change this policy. “A different
approach must be taken. The

“They're going to have to do
something to keep these damn
people (outsiders) out of buildings.
Screen these people out. The po-
licy doesn’t exist at this time."
said Capt. Ray.

“There has to be a revision. a
reversal in the open door policy
before changes can be made." he
said.

Capt. Ray agrees with the idea
of the university-community in-
terrelationship. “It’s idealistic,
wonderful,” he said. “From my
end of the stick, it’s.not working
though.”

During the summer months.
Capt. Ray had his hands filled
when a homemade bomb exploded
in a Tower B room. Also. three
University students were assault-
ed on the. Cathedral lawn by a
gang from in and around the lower
Oakland area.

Student statement decries ‘security’

At about 12:20 on Friday evening.
Sept. 5. a friend and I were attacked by
at least five blacks on the sidwalk near the
Fifth Avenue entrance of the Student Un-
ion. After about a ten minute struggle we
broke away and ran to the Bigelow en-
trance of the Union. The result of the at-
tack was not serious. I was beaten about
the head and one tried to steal my wallet.
The girl that I accompanied was thrown to
the ground but otherwise. unhurt.

When we rushed to the Union porch. I
screamed through the locked doors for a
policeman. After repeated shouts. one po-
liceman turned and walked from the Stu-
dent Union desk towards the door. He came
to the door and asked what we wanted. I
told him what had happened. He said there
was nothing he could do. I asked why.

“I don’t have a key." was the reply.
Can you get a key? No. there is only one key
to the door. Can you send some men out
then? No. My men are deployed all over the
building. clearing it out. Can you come out?

No.,I‘m in charge here and can‘t leave the .

building. After this useless discussion. we
left the porch in disgust. The girl was still
hystericallycrying. We stumbled around

to the Forbes Ave. entrance of the Union
and proceeded to walk into the building and
towards the Union's desk. We met the same
policeman at the desk. He once again mere-
ly asked us what had happened. I again told
the story and once again pleaded with him
to send some of his men out to apprehend
the men who attacked us for they were still
congregated on the sidewalk. And once
again. he said there was little he could do
and proceeded to ask me if I would fill out
a police report. I still insisted to know why
he wouldn't send any men outside. He then
told me. in a confidential tone. that he
couldn‘t send any men outside for it might

' create a riot situation. Still completely out-

raged by his attitude: I agreed to fill out a
report.

At this time, several other policemen
were now walking up and down in front of
the desk. One approached us and began to
fire questions concerning the report. I then
demanded to know what the report was
and what it would be used for. He told me
to just be quiet and answer the questions. I
refused. He threw the paper down and re-
fused to answer my questions.

gust when_two other people came to the
desk complaining that they had also been
attacked in the same manner that we had
been. I again asked the first officer I had
spoken to whether he was now going to
send some men outside. He said nothing
but proceeded to call on his walkie-talkie
for other men to come to the Union. The
important fact here is that there was a
three to four minute time lapse between
the time my girl and I first entered the
Forbes Ave. entrance of the Union and
when these two people came to the desk.
This means the officer in charge had ample
time to deploy some men outside and, at
least. pick up suspects for identification.

At this time.‘ I met another student who
told me he had also been beaten along with
his companion. This beating had occured
before the incident that involved us. After
we filled the reports out I turned and no-
ticed several more policemen standing
around. I asked two who were standing
closest to me. if any persons had been pick-
ed up for identification. The replied by
laughing at my question and strolling away.

After all these proceedings, we decided

to leave. We headed towards the ‘Forbes V

door and there we encountered a black 110- ” 

liceman. I asked him as we passed through

the door why all this was allowed to hap- '

pen. He then told us a few facts concern-

ing the BAS function that evening. V L
He said that he himself knew that more

than half of the people present at the doors

were not members of the University, that  

wine bottles were seen outside the Union,
and some of the people had drugs. He “said _
he knew these facts and I surmised that the if
other police there also knew theseifacts.
There was also a gun present among) the
attackers according to one of the girls
attacked. The black officer suggested to
me personally that I should go to Varsity
Hall and see someone with more authority
about the situation. He said he was sorry
but he was merely following orders and

could not leave his post at the door. He. 7 if

agreed with me that something could have _

been done and didn’t understand whyrit ’

hadn’t been.

‘We then left the Union and walked to

A ASRC needs support
To initiate revisions

by SANDY DeVIRGILIO
Staff News Writer

The Arts and Sciences Re-

, view Committee held the first in

a series of open meetings Wed-
nesday which propose to en-

’ gender sweeping changes in the

organization of
curriculum.

The nine-member committee,
chaired by Dr. David Bramhall,

undergraduate

g is composed of 5 faculty mem-

bers (Bramhall, David Hous-
ton, Dr. William Koerke, Dr.
Barrett Mandell, Dr. Orlando
Taylor), three students (Mike
Fabricant, Ellen Wartella, and
an as - yet — unnamed BAS re-
presentative) and a representative
from the office of the Dean of
the College of Arts, and Scien-

r ces (Roberta Salper ).

Student- faculty
Group to choose

‘$l000’ teachers  

For the first time in the his-
tory of the University, disting-
uished teachers will be reward-

ied. The College of Arts and

Sciences announced Wednesday
that four awards of $1,000 each
will be made at the end of the
Winter Term, 1969-70. The funds
will come from the Alumni,
and will be called the Alumni
Fund Awards for Outstanding
Teachers.

A student-faculty committee,
selected by the Council as soon
as possible.

Students and _ faculty are re-
quested to make nominations for
the awards. Nominations should be
accompanied by a statement of
particular factors which make
the nominee’s teaching worthy
of recognition, and should be
sent to the Dean of the College
of Arts and Sciences. . _

The awards will be presented
at the Annual banquet of the
College Alumni to be held on
May 1.

Deen Schneewind of the Col-

. lege of Arts and Sciences com-

mented, “The awards.won’t get

people to be better teachers.‘

Good teachers are good because
they’re interested in the stu-
dents, not because they're work-
ing for an award.

Schneewind believes the
awards will demonstrate CAS in-
terest in better teachers. “Per-
haps if better methods are pub-
licized, the ideas will spread
among many departments of the
college.”

By early winter term, the com-
mittee hopes to have recommenda-
tions for “major revisions” in
the undergraduate’s curricular
and extracurricular experience.
These recommendations will be
made to the Undergraduate Coun-
cil and must ultimately be vot-
ed on by the Faculty of Arts
and Sciences (FAS).

Therefore, although recom-
mendations may be made early
next term, it will take some time
for any significant changes to
take place. ‘

According to Bramhall, “The
only way very much is going to
happen in FAS is if a fairly
large movement of students take
an interest and show up by the
thousands at the FAS meet-
ings.”

To encourage student inter-
est and participation, the com-
mittee has scheduled its meet-
ingsfor noon, every other Wed-
nesday, in the SU. These meet-
ings will be completely open, as
will the hearing on specific top-

. ics planned throughout the term.

Representatives from the re-
vision committees of specific
departments are invited to
attend these meetings with the
object of exchanging and per-
haps coordinating ideas.

The committee plans to rap
with students at a mass meet-
ing which will strive not to be,
in the words of Bramhall, “a
series of speeches at people."

Dean Schneewind is willing
to suspend classes for an after-
noon so that as many students
as possible may become aware of
the committee and its goals.

One of the purposes of this
encounter, according to Man-
dell, is “to impress (upon the
students) the utter arbitrariness
of the given system. And the ut-
ter complexity of it.”

Committee members are pre-
paring briefs on the areas the
group proposes to examine.
Among these are:

-— requirements (minimum and
maximum loads, admission, QPA.
courses)

— philosophy underlying un-
dergraduate liberal arts educa-
tion

. The committee plans to post
information concern meetings,
hearings, and areas under ex-
amination on bulletin boards and
placards in the Cathedral and SU.
The next meeting, open to all
members of the academic com-
munity, is scheduled for Sept". 24.

T he Black Coalition

Monday Shutdown Possible

by MICHAEL HALEY

(Editor's note: The following story
was researched and written by a
student of the University, special
to The Pitt News.)

A group of University students
plan to have the University of
Pittsburgh shut down this coming
Monday. The group is alleged to
include members of the Students
for a Democratic Society (SDS)
and the Black Action Society
(BAS). Scott Baum. president of
Student Government. and other
concerned students.

Their plan will be coordinated
with other demonstrations spon-
sored by the Black Coalition. The

purpose of these demonstrations
is mainly to bring pressure against
the predominantly white craft un-
ions to loosen their monopoly on
jobs and to allow a much larger
share of the union membership
for black workers.

The way the group of University
students hope to close the Univer-
sity is to bring pressure against
Chancellor Posvar. They will try
to convince the faculty to petition
the Chancellor.

They also plan to recruit stu-
dents to demand that the Univer-
sity must be shut down. All of
these methods they hope will pres-
sure the Chancellor into accept-
ing their position.

Course probes military

And industrial complex

by BOB GING
Staff Writer

Innovative forces at the Uni-
versity have produced a new stu-
dent" designed course this fall.
The course, Explorations of the
Military Industrial Complex, has
been planned with maximum
student involvement in mind.

Approved by the CAS, this

A three-credit course will consist of

fifteen students and one faculty
member. Dr. Arnold Miller, as-
sistant director of the Univer-
sity Center for International Stu-
dies, who will approve all stu-
dents enrolled this term.

The material’ for the course
will be given by outside lectur-
ers, and by the students them-
selves. Among the guest lectur-
ers will be U. S. Representa-
tive William S. Moorehead, an
authority on the military—indus-
trial complex, Professor Solis
Horwitz. former secretary of
defense, and Professor Holbert
Carroll of the political science
department.

The course will be structured
to investigate the following ques-
tions:

1) what is the military - indus-
trial complex, what does it
encompass, and what are it’s
limitations?

A rally will be held on Fri-
day at noon for all students
interested in participating in
the march on Monday in sup-
port of the Black Construc-
tion Coalition. We need as
much student support as we
can get.

2) how unified is this complex,
and does it remain so at all
times?

(Continued on Page 7)

There is some speculation that
if these stdents' demands are re-

,jected this group will use more

drastic methods to guarantee that
the University is shut down. One
plan is to have those students in-
volved walk out of class. hold dem-
onstration. and try to disrupt the
work at either the University en-
gineering building or the new
WQED building.

The hope then is that there will
be a confrontation and arrests. A
more drastic proposal is to forcib-
l_v close the University. Those
concerned students will occupy
University buildings. stop work at
local construction sites, and dis-
rupt classes.

The most moderate alternative
is that those students sympathe-
tic with the black worker's de-
mands will voluntarily cut class
and join the demonstrators down-
town. This plan was supported
over forcibly shutting down the
University by Nate Smith when
questioned after a YWCA Supper
Room discussion Thursday.

All or part of these tentative
plans of action. it is assumed, will
be used if the University is not
shut down in support of the blacks.

Storaska to discuss
Female sell-protection

by SHERRI ZIPPAY
Literary Editor

With the possibility of as-
saults on women in the Oakland
area growing, Associated Wo-
men Students (AWS) will pre-
sent Frederic Storaska Sept. 24
in a series of lectures designed
for the self protection of wo-
men.

Storaska has been conducting
research on assaults on women
for six years. He has lectured to
over 100,000 women at 152 col-
leges and universities. His pro-
gram has officially save four
girls‘ lives and is reported to have
«assisted 34 girls out of assaults.

The program will give girls
an understanding. of the assault
interaction, including what
types of people assault and why
and how they do it. Storaska
will also explore what types of
environmental situations are us-
ually contributory to the as-
sault interaction and what type

of behavior from the girl usual-

mental and the most beneficial
behavior from the assaulter.

The dating situation is a ma-
jor part of the program, since
approximately 60 per cent of all
school and college age
girls who are assaulted are as-
saulted by their own dates. Every
possible situation where a girls
has been assaulted or could be
assaulted and how to prevent its
occurence will be included.

Times and places of the lec-
ture series will be announced in

  University issues

Tabor relates

University and
City problems

The essential mission of the
University, according to John Ta-
bor, Republican mayorality can-
didate, is to “provide the best ed-
ucation possible, for our people,
that can be provided” The Uni-
versity will serve as a “source of
strength” for the enterprises of
Pittsburgh, and should constantly
work to improve its “pure re-
search, to stimulate Pittsburgh’s
economic growth. ,

Tabor-, speaking in the SU Tues-
day night, presented his views on
the relationship between the city
and the University, the mayor and
the University, and John Tabor
and the University.

Tabor feels that the University
is a physical part of the commun-
ity, and that it has a relationship
as such. His rationale is that
many students how at the Univer-
sity have no college background,
and are on scholarships. These
students, according to Tabor,
have “the drive to move ahead
through education.” He feels that
one of the major roles of the Uni-
versity is to aid these students in
their goal. He contends that this
will benefit Pittsburgh, since
many of the students will live here,
raise their own economic status,
and, consequently, raise the stat-
us of the city. '

Although‘ Tabor tried in the
body of his talk, to speak about
what is relevant to University stu-
dents, it wasn't until questioned
by the audience that he revealed
his actual views on pertinent Uni-
versity issues.

A question was raised about Ta-
bor’s position on the confrontation
between the construction workers
and the Black Coalition. Tabor

said that “the situation never
should have gotten to the streets,”
that the mayor should have tried
solve the problem himself. Com-
menting on whatever violence
may have occurred, he stated,
‘‘It is wrong to reward violence
with the stopping of work.”

A commuting student explain-
ed to Tabor the plight of the com-
muter at the University (doubled
parking rates, heavy traffic, and
limited parking facilities, etc.).
The student asked how Tabor, as
mayor, would help the commuter
find a parking place. Tabor pro-
posed “additional facilities and
minimum rates” and mentioned

the remote possibility of an under— .

ground plaza.

Tabor was asked how he would
deal with campus disorders. He
stated that “peace maintenance
rests with the University. He feels
that the city shouldn’t intervene
unless requested to do so by Uni-
versity authority. However, Ta-
bor added that “the mayor’s pri-
mary duty is the safety of the
city,” and that he, as mayor,
would call in the police to main-
tain order in the city if he thought
it was necessary.

Tabor favors “either prosecu-
tion, or, more likely, a restrain-
ing order,” if a law is violated
by students.

Tabor came as politician,
Ignored relevant issues

by HARRIS MULLER
Staff Writer

One of the major issues on the
University campus is relevance.
Mayoralty candidate John Tabor
must not have known this, for his
for his speech was an exercise in
irrelevance.

Tabor, being a politician, must
be granted a few minutes to throw
out the usual politician's rhetoric.
Unfortunately for the audience
and Tabor, there seemed to be no
time within the speech when the
rhetoric ended and the relevant
discussion began. Instead of speak-
ing of issues, his time was occupied
with such flowery phrases as
“provide the best education pos-
sible for our people that can be
provided” and “the University
must serve as a source of strength
for the community.” .

Considering the apolitical na-
ture of the University student, it
was quite frustrating to hear Ta-
bor, the supposed answer to the
Democratic syndrome and the

spolitical nature of Pittsburgh,
avoid issues and dodge questions
so artfully that, at the end of his
hour, he had made no impression,
either positive or negative, on
most of the audience.

The audience took out at least
part of their frustration during
the question and answer period as
they lashed, out on specific issues.
One student questioned the com-
muter parking problem and an-
other Tabor’s reaction to any pos-
sible “campus disorder.” The re-
action from Tabor on the first
question was one of a man not well
enough informed to deal with the
issue, but yet determined to give
an answer. ’

Perhaps it is not the duty of a
man running for mayor of Pitts-
burgh to be knowledgeable of the
parking situation of the Univer-
sity, however, it definitely is not
the duty of a man running for the
mayor’s office to give a definitive
answer to a question concerning

such thing as 15 minute, short term, lunches. You
learn to wait. You take two hour lunches.”

Meursault is "an immediate sensualist,” The
Rabbi says. “Nothing is delayed. ‘I don’t care one
way or the other,’ says Meursault. ‘One life was as
good as another, and my present one suited me
quite well.’ It is the difference between the
bourgeois mentality and the absurdist mentality.”

It is the difference between living for today,
and living for tomorrow. “At 45," said Rubenstein,
“I’m not going to save up something so when I’m
decrepit and 60 I can enjoy it.”

“The people’s in the Woodstock thing . . . . sole
access to reality was what they read. All I can
do is think of it as an outsider. One‘s experience
there (meant that) it’s today that counts.”’

Dear A,

You’ve been away since April and a lot has
happened to my friends and me. Remember the
Free University? I started getting turned off to
the movement then. All those “student leaders”
and faculty playing petty power politics and look-
ing down their noses at people who didn’t
think the way they did. It opened my eyes and I’ve
been looking ever since. You may noteagree with
but I don’t mind.
* I feel comfortable with my thoughts.

what I’m going to say,

I think the best way now to improve general
conditions is to help my own specific one. I
wish everyone could feel the same way, but for
me to even advise you or anyone else to think one
particular way goes against what I believe. Let
others do what they will; I’ll do what I can. I
still care, you understand. I still contribute my
time, my nerves, and my money (at the risk of
something I
lieve in, but I won’t tell others what to do.

Perhaps the most action I’ll take in that di-
rection is communicating to people how I feel —
what my experiences are after I've done some-
-thing worthwhile or after I’ve felt that I’ve changed
“the system” for the better. People can only
they’ve experienced something. I

haven’t given up my ideals. I'm not totally dis-

people either. Interaction with other people is great,
and it’s inspirational to relate with someone else’s
mind. It keeps yours from stagnating. and I so
much want my mind to be open and fresh and free.

But I shall always keep in mind (If you’ll ex-

may end up resenting my commitments.

I’ll close now. I hope I’ve communicated to you

Tabor’s response to the second
question was, as one of his sup-

defame the name of the Press,
however, it seems that Tabor
could use more immediate
sources in order to gain some
knowledge of the University. Ta-

Freshman weekend
Spirit

by JUDY VOLLMER
Staff News Writer

University freshmen, counse-
lors, faculty and administration
members changed the usual Uni-
versity apathy towards activities
to excitement, challenge, and hap-
pening at Camp Kon-O-Kwee on
Freshman Weekend.

The campers combatted indif-
ference, mud,» rain, clammy
sheets, and damp bath houses.
Eight freshman teams equipped
with ideas, talent, and occasional
energy competed in the tradition-
al skit presentation. The victori-
ous Horny Toads highlighted their
skit with a smashing finale of
stripping to their bathing suits.

The teams competed rigorously
in sports, singing and a midnight
greased watermelon race. The
pace was fast, and team competi-
tion stiff, but an easy mood of

. not a ripple of

highlights camp

spirit kept the teams and their
counselors busy and boasting.

This 38th Annual Freshman
Camp was the first to be coed, and
guys complained about the added
hindrance of girls on the football
and volleyball teams. But their
complaints did not prevent them

from taking sufficient advantage

of the no-curfew system.

Crazy Eights, Zulus, .;_-and
Deuces battled each other in
sports, publicity, and cheering in
order to chalk up points to win the
coveted “two and one-half foot
gold engraved trophy.” Likewise,
the Student Body, the Nites, and
the Spirit of ’73 clashed in ver-
bal and dramatic warfare. But
the Horny Toads captured the cup
with their spirit, their skit, and
their most effective weapon—the
RIBBIT. Unfortunately, the “gold
engraved trophy” was disguised
as a 38-year-old battered tin pitch-
er. The name of the winning team
is to be engraved on the cup with
red magic marker.

Coach Reese “seriously” made
extremely brief and thought-pro-

voking remarks about the honor A

of winning, and the responsibilities
involved in being good sports.
When the trophy was presented
for all to admire, a freshman guy
groaned, “Man, two days of damn
hard work, and we have to win
this hunk of tinI” But the rest of
the winners were psyched enough
to_forget the physical personality
of the prize and look at its mean-
mg.

Uncle Herb Neiller, Kon-O-
Kwee Chief of Staff, provided the
cuisine and accommodations for
the pampered campers.

The weekend schedule allotted
little or no free time, and the con-
stant emphasis on team spirit and
team recognition suggested some-
thing interesting. If the intensive
activity and happy hsyteria of
Freshman Camp were transport-
ed to the Oakland campus, with
people reacting to people, the re-
sulting spirit could really shake
the University. One of the fresh-
man girls said, “I, had such a
great time just meeting and talk-

ing to people at camp that I feel  I

more at ease now on campus
since I have friends to see and
talk to. Now I’m really anxious to
meet more.”

Approximately 360 freshmen
and 68 counselors and faculty
members were excited and re-
sponsive enough to try to experi-
ence people at least for one week-
end. Camp Co—chairman Sandy
Stanko, in view of the solid stu-
dent spirit, and faculty represen-
tation, recommends the continua-
tion of coed Freshman Camp on a
larger scale.

I The chance for new students to
Involve themselves with meeting
classmates and faculty members
is a chance that Sandy will plan
for in a Freshman Camp evaluation
Theopportunity to participate in a
spirited student activity like
Freshman Camp is one to be ex-
plored. Because, if enough inter-
ested people could really feel all
of the yelling, laughing, thinking,
and learning, they could bring it
all on home and let the University
live.

DePasqua to scout Bruins in LA.

by ED CONLEY

Carl DePasqua plans to watch his Panther gridders
scrimmage for the last time this afternoon. Then, he’ll be off

to California to watch UCLA.

The Uclans will be kicking off their 1969 season a week early,
and the Panther mentor will not be just another fan out there in the

gigantic Coliseum.

I’ll be looking at everything
they’ll be doing,” DePasqua no-
ted. “We’ll have to use our bas-
ic offense against them, but we’ll
probably make some deletions,
and some additions too.”

Any change will not be a ma-
jor one, however, so the Bruins

  
 

can expect to see DePasqua
throw the promised ground at-
tack at them. But, have the Pan-
ther ball carriers satisfied their
coach in practice?

“No, they haven’t progressed
to our expected end; they haven’t
done what we’ve expected,” De-

TONY ESPOSITO (45) is battling Sophomore Lou Julian for the Pan-

ther fullback job. Running will be a major part of the team’s offense this
fall and Coach Carl DePasqua is depending on runners like Esposi-
to. The Panther will play ball controll this fall.

Aflight end

Pilconis likes challenge

by MARTHA HARTLE
Associate Sports Editor

Bill Pilconis is back with the offense and he couldn‘t be

happier, “to say the least."

And that’s not all he‘s happy about. The tall, lanky re-
ceiver put on ten pounds over the summer and is “real hap-

py with this."

“My playing weight last year was about 202, and now I’m up to

Last year as a 202 pound soph-
omore, Pilconis wound up play-
ing defensive end. “The way the
defensive end position was play-
ed last year, with the contain-
ment type defense, I was heavy
enough for the positiion. But not
now. This year, the ends are play-
ing more aggressively and tak-
ing on the blockers, not just
making tackles.”

Pilconis has been working
both at the split end and tight
end spots on offense this fall,
and he anticipates seeing more
action on the tight side. “My
heart is with split end, but tight
end is more challenging and I’d
rather play there,” he explained.

With the coaches stressing a
ball control offense, the tight
end will becalled on to do a lot
of blocking up front and Pilconis is
touted as a fine blocker. “I’m
satisfied with my blocking to
date,” he continued, “but I hope
to get much better at it. I had
a really good coach in high
school and that’s where I learn-
ed a lot about blocking.”

“We may go with a lot of tight
formations this year, with both
ends in tight,” he went on.
“Bringing both ends in tight
could definitely help keep a
ground attack moving and we
may use this quite a bit.”

Despite the accent on running
and blocking, the junior letter-
man still anticipates plenty of op-
portunities to catch the foot-
ball. "I figure on running pass

lpattersn as much as any other re-

ceiver and I think l’ll have the
opportunity for ‘as, many recep-
tions as any other. As a-team we’ll

of passing from last year but we
will pass. You need to pass to
win.

Despite the loss of wingback
Joe McCain for the entire sea-
son, Pilconis is optimistic that
the offense still has a fine corps
of receivers on hand. “We’d be
better with McCain, but the re-
ceivers are definitely good enough
to do the job.”

Their first job comes at UCLA
next weekend and it will be the
second time around the Colis-
eum for Pilconis. “You go into
the game,” explains Bill, “with
the attitude that you aren’t play-
ing UCLA. You get yourself pre-
pared for anything and you learn
what to do against certain de-
fenses, UCLA’s or anybody’s.”

Bill. PILCONIS
 _j jﬁlockijngj Ab_ility Helps L I

Pasqua answered. “We’ll have
to expose, expose in order to
progress. We’ll have to.

“We can’t go to an all-out
passing game. We can com-
plete the short pass, but we’ve
got to forget about the long ones.”

DePasqua doesn’t know
who will be tossing the passes
when the team accompanies
him to the Coliseum for next
Saturday’s opener. He will
probably have to select a start-
ing quarterback before his
scouting jaunt so that the sig-
nalcaller will be able to practice
with the first team for at least
a week prior to the game. But,
that seems highly unlikely, Frank
Gustine, Chuck Winters, and Jim
Friedl are still in the running
for the starting berth.

“It looks like I’ll have to go
with all three next week. They’-
re that close,” DePasqua reason-
ed. “The starter in the game
will be the one who moves the
offense, the one who can come
through for us.”

But the key to the success of
the Jungle Cat offense might
not be the runners ‘or the quar-
terbacks. Everything could

hinge on the performance of
the line, something that is of-,

ten referred to as the Panther’s
weakest unit.

Sophomore John Simpson,
slightly injured at the moment,
and Ed Sadowski are the best
bets to start, at guard, with Bill
Beinecke and Dennis Persin the
probable tackles. Dave Magyar
and Bob Kuziel are battling at
center.

It will be. difficult to gener-
ate any kind of an offense if

these men up front don’t come
through.

“Their progress has been
slow,” DePasqua said. “Of course,
you've got to remember that it’s
a new system for all the kids.” -

Just about everything the team  -

has done so far has been in-
volved with getting used to the
“system,” and it’s a good time
for analyzing the progress‘.

“N0. We’ve had no progress —.

in all aspects of the game," De-
Pasqua stated. ~ 3‘

There isn’t much time left‘

for adjusting, either. Next week’s
drills have to be aimed at the
opener. And, DePasqua has
found another problem setting
in.

“It’s the weather conditions,”
he mentioned. "“It’s cooled up
a little, and that’s got the guys
up a bit, but we’re going to
have to play in hot weather
out there.”

DENNIS PERSIN
Starting Offensive Tackle

Bcmncm likes switch

- by MARC SIMON

First team defensive cornerback Mike Bannan seems to
reflect the quiet confidence and determination that is be-
ginning to characterize the DePasqua regime in Pitt foot-
ball. The six—foot, 195-pound political science major is realis-
tic about the Panther past and the murderous schedule the
team will face; he won’t make any predictions about how the team
will fare, but he is far from being pessimistic about the team’s chances

this fall.

“We have the material here
to give anyone a game,” he ex-
plained. “We have great coach-
ing. We have more depth than
ever before.” Xannan feels the
team will be all right once it
gains a little more confidence in
itself and solidifies as a unit.

Bannan came to Pitt from
West Chester, Pennsylvania, as

a quarterback but was switch— ‘

ed to defense last year. “I had
never played defense before,”
he explained.

“But now,” he continued, “I
like hitting and being on de-
fense.” The most difficult
thing for him (and probably for
any defensive back) is man-to-
man pass coverage on a speedy

receiver. “It’s just you and
him,” Bannan explained. “If
you make one mistake, fifty-

thousand people can see it.”

Bannon, who hopes to give
either professional baseball or
football a try, was originally
headed for Virginia Tech when
he graduated from high school,
but was sold on Pitt by former
coach Dave Hart. Also, he wanted
the "challenge of playing big-
time football, and the schedule
here is what he wants.

Bannan admitted that the
specter of past defeats still
hangs over Panther football, but
he added that, “Everybody has
their own way of getting up
for a game. We have to forget the

past and play theggames one at‘ at A‘ .

Apathy also has lingered over
the campus during the last few
years, but Bannan feels that “the
students are basically behind
us. The press has been really
good to us this year.”

He feels that there is a new
attitude toward football here.
“There’s a lot of competition on
the team for positions, but still,
everybody’s pulling for each
other. The spirit is high.

Perhaps the new attitude of
quiet determination instead of
the old rah-rah stuff is what is
needed at the University. The
wild predictions and exiiltations of
the past are gone. Mike Bannan
is a new cornerback and seems
to have the new attitude. Let’s
hope both he and the new spirit
are successful.

Wednesday’s full slate of eight football games marked the
opening of the 1969 fraternity athletic program as well as the
yearly competition for the respective “A” and “B” League All-Sports
Trophy. The opening night of the Greek softball season also inaugurated
the new lit playing fields located behind Trees Hall.’

In “A” League action, Sigma
Alpha Mu, sparked by the Steve
.Cherry’s timely hitting and Larry
;Tarr’s flawless fielding, edged
Zeta Beta Tau, 4-2. The Sam-

" mies had to put down ZBT’s last

IEBERHAR

The Justrite pen by
Eberhard Faber is a great

- writer. Writes more and
writes better, without
blotting, smearing or
glopping. Because the
point is a slick
carbide ball.

Has many other
credentials: See-Thru
barrel that reveals
everything (like how
much ink is left)

. . . Self-cleaning ink
eraser. . . Plastic cap
that protects the point
. . .' A handy clip.

And the Justrite is
better-looking, too.

Medium point
(illustrated) just 19¢;

fine point, 25¢. Four ink
colors: Red. Blue. Green.
Black. At your

college bookstore.
