Committee, any graduate student who
has taught in the School of Arts and Sci-
ences over the past year — spring, sum-
mer or fall semesters — is eligible for
nomination. The Teaching Award Com-
mittee islone committee within the Diet-
rich School of Arts and Sciences Gradu-
ate Student Organization, a group -that
advocates the interests and concerns of

graduate students in the School of Arts_

& Sciences. Various members within the
organization may volunteer to sit on the
committee.

Grove added that undergraduates,
graduate students or faculty members
submitting nominations on the Pitt

Graduate Student Organizations website g‘

should have had at least some experience
with the nominee’s teaching within the
past year.

The deadline for nominations is Feb.
7. Nominees can then apply for the award
by March 7, and the Teaching Award
Committee will notify winners in early
April.

According to the Baranger award’s
website, it aims to raise the standards
of the graduate students’ teaching, con-
tribute to or stimulate discussions about

the quality of graduate students’ teach-

ing and prepare graduate students for
professional success in education.

Grove said she hopes the award will '

improve communication between under-
graduates and graduate students about
what makes a teacher engaging. '

“In terms of an undergraduate being
able to have a say in how their classroom
is taught or honor something that has
been done well, there are very few op-

§p9__rt_nr}Hities for that, in terms of teach- '

ing,” Grove said. “'1'his is one place where

.. undergraduate students can really have

a voice and put in their two‘ cents.”

Grove said the nominations will in-

clude a broad iﬁriety V of graduate stu-
dents from a number of different ﬁelds.

The'online submission requires I the’
graduate student’s name, department, -

email address, course taught and reason
for nomination. Submitters must also
include their email address and relation-
ship to the nominee.

“The one thing I like about the nomi- . I

nations‘ is that it doesn’t deﬁne what a
good teacher is, because that’s different
for every student on some level,” Grove
said. “Some student may want an incred-
ibly crazy teacher who is hilarious and

really fun. Another student may ﬁnd that
same person very disorganized.”

Nomination is only the ﬁrst stage in
the award process.

According to John Wenskovitch, a
computer science graduate student and
chair of the Teaching Awards Commit-
tee, once the nominations are complete,
the committee will invite nominees to
apply for the award about a week after
the submission deadline.

Wenskovitch said the application
allows nominees, to demonstrate their
teaching abilities through a portfolio
describing their teaching philosophy, a
challenge they have faced while teaching

and how they overcame it, and a piece of ,

their teaching material such as a work-
sheet or slideshow slides. Applicants
must also select and submit two OMET

The teaching award committee is
still in the process of inviting faculty
membersfor the secondary commit-
tée. Wenskovitch said faculty members

. that reviewed nominees’ applications in

previous years and the Arts and Sciences
faculty advisors have first priority on the
committee, and the rest are based on
suggestions from the Teaching Awards

' “We look for candidates  make

While the award recognizes excep-
tional teaching, it might also motivate

recipients to strive for further improve- ~

Bobby Karimi, one of last year’s win-

Fedele said if students seek help from the
Department of Off-Campus Living after they
have already signed a lease, the department
will advise students to communicate with

landlords “in a way that is clear and provides ’

arecord of the communication.” . .

Fedele also said that if property condi-
tions become dangerous or uninhabitable,
students should contact the City’s Bureau of
Building Inspection or the Allegheny County
Health Department.

Campus Living functions primarily to assist

From the mayoral seat -

~ Mayor Bill _Peduto_ is publicly shaming

landlords who have multiple code violations

in Pittsburgh, and he’s doing it with signs -

and red ink. . ' .
Peduto’s “Operation Red” is a program

that aims to improve living conditions by ‘

shaming landlords who refuse to address

' safety hazards within their rental proper-

ties by publicly displaying their names and
contact informationon large signs installed
at the sites of the properties. ’

It has been more than a year since Peduto
4 inaugurated earlier this month — passed
a law informally called Operation Red in De-
cember 2012, while he was still a Pittsburgh
city councilman representing District 8.

According to Sonya Toler, communica-
tions director for Peduto, the program targets
“the most dereiict properties in the city to
shame slum landlords into taking careof
them.” '

Toler saidthe program’s name comes from
the large red signs that Public Works employ-

ees place in front of the derelict properties. '

For concerns that need more immediate

— Toler suggests students contact the Al-

City Council members to have ‘the signs

According to Toler, the Bureau of Build: .

about the sign, which remains in front of his

days can be reduced if the property owner

of Pittsburgh, it can create an upset, irate

landlord and an adversarial situation,” ‘
Namey said.

In the case of an emergency, situation,
such as a heating problem in the middle of
winter or a gas leak, the Health Department
would respond with a prompt inspection.

After an inspection has taken place, the
Health Department would then issue orders
to the property owner to ﬁx the problem.
After the department issues orders, typically
over the phone, it will then perform a follow-
up inspection to ensure that the property
owner executed the orders.

In regard to Operation Red, Namey said
the success of the program is likely to be de-
pendent on the individual property owners.

“If a property owner cares about their
property and their tenants, I would think
that [Operation Red] may have an effect,”
Namey said. “But if there is a property owner
who doesn’t really care about either, then I
think the effects [of the program] could be
minimal.” . ,

According to Rick Swartz, executive di-
rector of the Bloomﬁeld—Garﬁeld Corpora-
tion, students who feel as if they are living
in substandard housing should document

any complaints and correspondences with
their landlords concerning those complaints.
“[Students should] be sure that at “some
point, there has been a letter given to the
landlord pointing out what the problems
are,” Swartz said.
Swartz said students should send their

' letters to their landlords by certiﬁed mail and

request a return receipt to indicate delivery
took place. A"

He added that students should then allow
timefor their landlords to respond to letters.

And in some cases, members of city
government might be most ﬁt to alleviate
a housing issue.

Toler said students can contact the may-
or’s office or the office of the City Council
representative. of their district and a staff
memberwill assist with students’ off-campus
housing issues. ' ' .

“The mayor hopes that [Operation Re ]
will compel the worst-of-the-worst landlords
in the city to clean up their act or sell their
properties to responsible property owners,”
Toler said. “When slum landlords can no
longer hide behind anonymity, they’re much
more likely to stop abusing our neighbor-
hoods.” I

In case you were _too busy following
the government shutdown or exam-
ining the intricacies of Obamacare
this past fall, you might have missed

November, a ballot stating that
porn stars had to wear condoms
in ﬁlms made in Los Angeles County
. passed with a,56 percent majority,
and just last week, an administrative
law judge ruledthat condoms are
mandatory for all adult ﬁlms made
in California.

” Obviously, the porn industry is
‘upset. They are complaining that
this new law adds unnecessary
expenses to an already ﬁnancially
precarious ﬁeld and that the law
infringes on their First Amendment
right to free speech, to express fan-
tasies in any facet they see ﬁt. As
a result, many adult studios have
moved to Las Vegas to circumvent
the law, but there is already concern
that the law will spread to Sin City,
as well, which is ﬁne by me.

Aside from theyfact that adult
performers areeight to 15 times
more likely to contract a sexually

the latest pornography news: In"

transmitted" disease than your av-
erage person and ‘all the other so-
cial, humanitarian and feminist
issues surrounding porn stars, I’
ﬁnd it problematic that condoms
are considered unsexy, that a por-
nographic escapist fantasy could
never be successful because you
added a piece of rubber into the
mix. We have to realize that adult
ﬁlms oftentimes are not watched
by adults, but by teens holed up in
theirbedrooms with chairs wedged
undertheir doorknobs. Whatwe’re
showing them is that the only cool
way to have sex is without protec-
tion — not true.

_Our country could use a good
dose of realism in its media. Sex isn’t
always sexy. It’s not always ﬁill of
candles, rose petals and black lace.
It can be messy and awkward and

just ﬂat-out weird. We romanticize
sex and itdistorts ourexpectations.

Realism isn’t always bad for en-
tertainment. Look at MTV’s “Teen
Mom,” which is the follow-up show

- to “16 and Pregnan ” and shows

the girls’ struggles to balance both
the roles of teenager and mother. A
study recently released by the Uni-
versity of Maryland and Wellesley

Keeping it real: Media should set

realistic expectations. , J

N College found that the two MTV

shows were partly behind plum-
meting teen birth rates in the United
States. MTV makes money, teens
learn how stressﬁil life is with ”.a
child and everyone walks away
happy. Score one for reality TV. . ‘
So if you’re going to show peo-

ple, speciﬁcally teens, excessive
amounts of unprotected sex, at least
show them the consequences, as
well. What’s happening off-camera
is that porn stars are contracting
STDs and then losingtheir jobs be-
cause of it, but producers are too
busy marketing sex as carefree to
bother with any of that.

, I’m not saying that everythingin
the.media has to be moralistic and

preachy and show the worst—case .

scenario for every poor decision.
What I am saying is that we need
to set more realistic expectations
in the media because we’re creating
unattainable standards that beneﬁt
nobody except for the companies
that are paddingtheir pockets at our
expense. Adding condoms to porn

. is a great way to start with these

realistic ideals. l

‘ Some companies are going out of their 

to stay grounded. Take Aerie’s new model-
ing campaign, for example.—The campaign,
called Aerie Real, features acast of totally un-

. photoshopped models with the tagline “the

real you is seity.” American Eagle, the parent
company of the underwear line, noticed that

. there was something fundamentally wrong

with the expectations we were settingfor girls
and wanted to show more realistic represen—'
tations. Not everyone’s stomach is perfectly

L ﬂat, and cellulite isn’t just something you see

on overweight people. Aerie’s campaign isn’t
.a new idea — Dove launched their Campaign
for Real Beauty back in 2004 — but this un-
ﬁltered realism issomething we need to see
more of, especially when targeting teens.
These poor representations of reality
affect all demographics, however —' not
just teenagers, HBO’s show “Girls,” starring
Lena Dunham and produced by Judd Apa-

V tow, is controversial for several reasons, one ‘
of which is the amount of skin and lackof ~

clothes that Dunham often ﬂaunts. When
a reporter saidto Dunham,-“I don’t get the

—purpose of all of the nudity on the show. 

Your character is often naked just atrandom
times for no reason,” she smartly responded,
“It’s because it’s a realistic expression of what
it’s like to be alive, I think, and I totally get
it.” Dunham is not the most ﬁt or beautiﬁil
starlet in Hollywood, but it is her uncut raw-
ness that brings a new edge to TV. Most of
us are a whole lot more similar to Dunham
than we are to Blake Lively and her Serena
van ‘der Woodsen “Gossip Girl” persona, so
why are we afraid and repulsed of this hon-

T est representation of humanity when~it’s on
‘TV? Why does it make us so uncomfortable?

There’s something very problematic about
the way we portray reality in the media.

It’s warped and twisted, melted down and
sculpted into something that only vaguely
resembles what we know as reality. Reality
can be just as‘ fun and sexy as all this fake-

ness implies, but we’re blinded to_it because _
we’re so used to things that aren’t real, that

don’t exist.- _ V
It’s not going to change overnight, but

. I applaud every step in the right direction.

Bring on the crying babies of teenage families;
the muffin tops, girls showing up to parties
in sneakers and, of course, condoms in the
porn industry. Life doesn’t get much more
real than all that. I .

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL

Kiesel’s late shot lifts

Dave Uhrmacher
Senior Staﬂ“ .Wrz'ter

The evolution of a coach and her point guard
came full circle on one play Thursday night.

After a game in which the Pitt wor_nen’s
basketball team hadn’t held a lead since
14:02 of the ﬁrst half, it snaggedan advan-

tage with just three seconds to go. Junior '

point guard Brianna Kiesel scored, giving
the Panthers a lead that would catapult them
to their second ACC victory of the season.

Pitt (10-11, 2-5 ACC) battled back and
beat Boston College on Thursday night at the
Petersen EX/ents Center in dramatic fashion,
ending the game on an 8-0 run that led to
the ﬁrst home conference win since 2011.

“I am so proud of these players,” head
coach Suzie McConnell-Serio said. “Our play-
ers continue to believe in each other, and it
ﬁnally has paid off.” , i

It was a back—and—forth bout between
Boston College and Pitt, two of the lower-
tier ACC teams, for the ﬁrst ﬁve minutes of
the contest.

Pitt grabbed an early fo'ur-point lead with
14:29 to go on a layup by senior forward Asia
Logan, but only held it for a minute and 30
seconds.

The Panthers were never able to regain

the advantage in the ﬁrst half.

MEN’S BASKETBALL

Upstart Virginia team pos

Ryan Bertonaschi
Staff Writer

The Pitt men’s basketball team might not
focus on a single offensive player in its game
against Virginia, the only team in the chase
for the ACC regular-season title without an
obvious superstar. But the Panthers are sure
to focus on a plan to work around a stingy
Cavaliers’ team defense.
The second-place Cavaliers have only
two players averaging double ﬁgures in scor-
ing. Redshirt sophomore Malcolm Brogdon

With 10:43 remaining, Boston College
made a 12-0 run to extend their lead to 28-
15 over the course of the next ﬁve minutes.

Mo_st_of the Panthers’ success came when
they were able to break the zone defense
by getting the ball inside, as they posted 10

season All-ACC Team. And not only do the
Cavaliers lack a go—to scorer, but Virginia
ranks 13th out of 15 ACC teams in scoring
at 67 points per game.

Excluding a 69-65 loss at Duke, the Cava-
liers have played an easy ACC schedule so

far, but that’s not the reason behind their

early success. -

They own the No. 1 scoring defense in the '

country, allowing a mere 56 points per game.

In the past, several coaches have beaten
the Panthers by disrupting the natural ﬂow
of Pitt head coachjamle-Dixon’s style of play.
The most notable example of this came in
2011, when Notre Dame coach Mike Brey
used his “burn” offense to grind out the
Panthers. V

points in the paint. Most of that success came

courtesy of Logan, who sank a three-point '

shot with 10 seconds remaining to cut the
Eagles’ lead to 37-27 — a score that stayed
that way headed into halftime. ‘

Logan led the way with 12 points in the

system — help-side defense -—— and for the
remainder of the season, various coaches
used Brey’s tactic to ‘stab at the Panthers.

’ On Monday, Duke coach Mike Krzyze-

wski was able to push Pitt’s National Player of ,

zone. -

. Krzyzewski assigned 6-foot—8 forward
Rodney Hood to guard~Patterson. Hood‘
denied Patterson the ball within 23 feet of
the basket, and Patterson’s 14 points came
mostly in the open court. Patterson seldom
received a pass inside shooting range, and he
was trapped at times around the perimeter,
where the bulk of Patterson’s ﬁve turnovers
occurred.

After the game, Krzyzewski credited

New Hampshire, Pitt’s gymnastics team will
hope to improve its record to 4—0 today when
it takes on North Carolina at 7 pm. in Chapel
Hill, N.C. ‘

Pitt coach Deb Yohman’s team took vic-
tories on bars and ﬂoor in the match against
New Hampshire, though it was edged out on
vault and beam. .

North Carolina is a formidable opponent
for the Panthers, ranking third in the EAGL
conference with a 3-2 overall record and a 2-1
record in conference play.

Women’s Tennis

The spring season marks the ﬁrst season
in the highly competitive ACC for Pitt tennis.
First-year coach Alex Santos and his team will
have to wait until Feb. 22 for the beginning of
conference play, though.

In the meantime, Pitt starts its season at
2 p.m. on‘ Saturday when it plays Morehead
State at home at Alpha Tennis and Fitness
in Harmar, Pa. The Panthers are led by se-
niors Kimmy Boiza, Taylor Washington and
Jocelyn Lu. Borza ﬁnished last spring with a
10-7 record in singles and a team—best record
of 14-7 in doubles.

look for different ways to free Patterson

, from defenders.

“We’ve got to do__a better job in getting
him in position,” Dixon said. “And that falls
on me.”

On Tuesday, Bennett’s team showed ev-
eryone that it is capable of disrupting the
intended play of opposing teams’ superstars.

"”’I*he Cavaliers held Notre Dame’s leading

scorer, Garrick Sherman, to just eight points.
“The majority of the time, we were in

the right positions and made Sherman see’ '
start in ACC play since the 1982-1983 season.

the trap coming, and we pulled it off,” Ben-
nett said of his team’s defensive effort after
Virginia’s game on Tuesday.

Virginia has now won four straight
games, and Brogden has emerged as one
of the most complete players in the league.

Brogden has been Virginia’s leading scor-
er in each of its past three games, checking
in with 16, 18 and 16 points — he’s setsome
personal highs, as well. .

The 6-foot—5 sharpshooter, who is shoot-
ing 39 percent from 3-point range, had a
career high in steals (5), and matched career
highs in rebounds (7) and assists (6) on Tues-

day, helping the Cavaliers achieve their best

For the ﬁrst time in schoolhistory, the
margin of victory in each of the Cavaliers’
ﬁrst seven ACC wins is at least 10 points.

This is ideal redemption for the Cavaliers,
whose case for an NCAA Tournament bid will
continue to be marred by losses to Green Bay
and Tennessee, among others. ‘ '

Include Brey among the believers in the
Cavaliers’ ability heading into their matchup
against the Panthers. _

“ [Virginia] might be the most conﬁdent

team in theleague,” Brey said in his press

way back into the game, and four straight _

points from Logan brought the deﬁcit back
to two once again. i ,,

Following Kiesel’s basket that tied the
score with 45 seconds left, redshirt sopho-
more Loliya Briggs drew an offensive foul
that proved to be the second—most important
play of the game._ ‘

With only one second separating the game
clock and shot clock, McConnell-Serio called
a timeout and drew up a play to get the ball in
the hands of her best player, Kiesel.

As the shot clock ticked away, Kiesel drove
_down the left side of the lane and lofted a run-
nerthat bounced gently off the glass and fell
through the net with just 3.1 seconds remain-
ing and the Panthers leading by two.

_ “Our go—to play was with the ball in [Kie-
sels] hands andaﬂat ball screen in the middle
of the ﬂoor,” McConnell-Serio said. “Either
way, she was getting a screen with man or
zone.” I '

“She picks-her. moments and none bigger
than tonight when she hits the game-winner,”
she continued. . 3

’ A last—second effortby Boston College fell
just short as time ticked off.

Logan ﬁnished with a team-high and
season—high 24 points.

‘Pitt returns to action on Monday, Feb. 3,
when they host Georgia Tech at 7:00 p.m.

  

The men’s and women’s track and ﬁeld teams
hope to build on astrong start when they travel
to University Park for the Penn State Invita-
tional on Friday and Saturday.

The_Pitt teams last competedjan. 25 at the
Hokie Invitational, where Brycen Spratling
scorched his competition in the 400—meter
dash with a ﬁrst—place ﬁnish and the top time
at the meet of 47.40 seconds.

Evann Thompson led the women’s team,

winning the 800—meter run in 2:12.91, a new _

personal record and season best for Pitt.

Swimming and diving

Pitt’s men’s and women’s swimming and
divingteams last competedjan. 18 when they
defeated Denison and James Madison Uni-
versity at Trees Hall Pool. The Panthers will
