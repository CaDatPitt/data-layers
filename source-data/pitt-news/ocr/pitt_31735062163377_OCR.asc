By NANCY DELANEY 
A Board of Appeals, consisting of eight faculty and ad-
ministration members, will soon have the authority to review
cases of campus parking violations and to waive or reduce

ﬁnes and tow—away fees, revealed Frank J, Callanen, Ad-
ministrative Assistant to the Assistant Chancellor of Student

and ‘General Affairs.’

Of the 190 allegedly illegally~parking automobiles that
have been towed away by the University Security Depart-

ment in the past few weeks,

_13 appeals have already been

ﬁled. Hearings-for these appealse .

will be held along strictly legal
lines, according to Callanen.-" -

To ensure that student viola-

tors involved will “have_someone

on their side,” Callanen indicated
that, in the case of undergraduate

.'students, a member ‘of the Stu-

dent Government’s Committee-on
Parking Appeals will always be
present at the reviews, and, in
the ’case of graduate students,
_Nicholas Bery, research assist-
ant to the Vice Chancellor of

be present. , _

The SG committee was es-

tablished, according‘ to presi-
dent Martinf.Landy, “to, see that
campus police don’t deal with
students unfairly,” although he
doubts that they would. “We
just want to make sure they
'don’t get ‘tow-happy’!” Landy

to an inter—faith marriage, Dr.
Rubinstein stated, “Marriage is a
risky business and when you cross
lines it is more difficult.”

V Individuals in America have

diﬂiculty in asserting ’ their

masculinity or feminnity accord-

ing to Rabbi Rubensteinand this
is one of the basic problems con-
fronted in most marriages,

An inter-faith marriage has to
-come to grips with outside pro-
blems not encouraged in marri-
ages that stay within traditional

lines. Firstly, the converted mate, I

statistically the female, has to ﬁnd
, a new place in the community. “In
six years I’ve been involved in 40
conversions,” stated Dr. Rubin-
.stein, “all of them were females.”
 ’ Children's Religion
The second and definitely the
greatest problem and area of con-
flict is deciding what to’ do with
‘the children’s religious upbring-
ing. Dr. Rubenstein feels that
there are three possible solutions.
The decision’_can be left to the
child but this solution has. un-
pleasant ramiﬁcations as the child
will be rejecting one parent no
matter which way he leans. The
parents may join the Unitarian
Church which Dr. Rubinstein
terms “the half-way house” as he
feels that socially the Unitarian
Church is Jewish for the Jews
and Christian for the Christians.
The third solution which Dr.
Rubinstein feels is the most
realistic would be a conversion‘
of one of the mates. “If you are
going to do it there is no cheap
way to cross boundaries. Do it
the real way,” he urges.

Hailperin’s_ work shows how
two great scholars of the Scrip-
tures collaborated (ﬁguratively)
over two centuries in study that
brought both Christians and Jews
a deeper understanding of the an-
cient lore and literature which
hold their common spiritual heri-
tage. Rashi and Lyra searched
the Holy Word for a deeper un-
derstanding of God and Man.

Author Hailperin has done re-
search in all major European
cities as well as Pittsburgh. His
reading knowledge of the lan-
guage of ancient manuscripts -
Arabic, Hebrew, Aramaic, Greek,
Latin —— was frequently called on
in his research. Hailperin is the
leader of the Tree of Life can?
gregation in Shadyside.

Dr. Freehof is a colleague of
the author and convinced him to
publish his work. Freehof, a fre-

Foreign Students
Frank in Appraisal

By PAT POLLINO

The crowd was disappoint- A

ing, but the discussion was

stimulating Monday at SUE

Forum Series’ “The Image of
America.”

An international panel of
students parleyed the “image”
idea to near exhaustion. Foreign
students on the panel were quite
frank in casting a shadow over
America’s self-image.

Members of, the panel were:
Blasi Nayar,
Mamdani, Uganda;_ Miguel Seyo-
via, Costa Rica; Aart Van de Laar,
The Netherlands, and Martin
Landy United States. Dr. Alex
Weidenmann was moderator.

‘ Image Expressed
Each panel member expressed

an image of America as he sees it, .

Then Landy, president of Student
Government, took America’s stand
on the matter, '

Nayar tagged Americans as
being indifferent to changes
taking place in other" parts of
the world. He declared the av-..
erage stereotyped American
doesn’t have any interest in po-
litical affairs “except when the
government interfered with his
own possessions.”

In reference to India, he at-
tacked American foreign, policy-
as completely omitting the people
of the country it deals -with. He
marked Americans as aggressive
imperialists and colonialists.» .

“Capitalism Outmoded”

“The American ideology of cap-

italism is outmoded,-” said Nayar,

in a parting blast at images forced.

upon people.

Mandani criticized Americans
as intruders in the cultures of
other countries. He said harm is
often times done in trying to ;
Americanize people. Tourists,
movies and popular music, he
noted, present the United States
as a. nation with “low moral and'\
religious standards.”

'However, Mamdani pointed out
-that the Peace Corps is doing a
great.d'eal to improve the Amer-
ican image.

Many Ways of Life

Seyovia asserted there is no
such thing as a unique concept of
an American image. He explained
that there are ‘many ways of life

INTERNATIONAL PANEL examined ‘The Image of America’ dur-

 
     

ing the SU Forum series as part of the International Week activities._
The subject was discussed exhaustively by the panel who _must re-

main unidentiﬁed due to a lapse

here, “just like there are _many
ways of life in my country.
“Images change your condi-
tions,” he said.

In choosing a somewhat differ-
ent approach torthe subject, Van
de-Laar bracketed the sources of
American image abroad into three
categories. They are: military peo-
ple, students and tourists visiting
onga temporary basis, and U.S.
agencies. ' ~ .

Students Show Understanding

“-The exchange students tend to
show a better understanding,” Van
de Laar noted. “Official policy (the
latter category) shows a lack of
consistency.” 4

According to Van de Laar,
Americans exploit other peoples
in trying to impose what they
think upon others. “But the'con-,
cept of paradise is different for
all people” he said.

Landy projected to Western Eu- _

rope many of the criticisms direct-
ed at America. He did not agree
that Americans are over—material-
istic. , I

“Materialism is‘ a part of in-

Landy concluded that many na- -

tions are jealous of us and express

their resentment simply because 
they are not willing to accept the .

U.S. as a world power.

A cross-examination followed.
and the program was culminated
with a question—and-answer,

last week’s showing of the West Virginia game is that the entire operation
isbeing ﬁnanced, organized, and staged by students here at the University

to provide a service to the student body which they would normally not

Bijur has estimated the cost'of the project. at $4500,.and is therefore
being forced to sell tickets to the ﬁeld house showing in order to cover

Student tickets are going for one dollar a piece,‘ and regular tickets
for two dollars. By selling 1,500 of each, Bijur hopes to make up the $4500

The terrible shame of the whole affair is that Bijur or anyone should

University failing to administer to the legitimate wants of the student body. 5)‘

For an opposite example, take a look at the enormous preparation
and trouble which the University went through for the Hootenanny tele-
casts earlier this term. Everything possible was done to insure that the
proper image of the University would appear from coast to coast. The
students were mere instruments of a higher cosmic purpose; to induce
millionaires to give their excess cash to the school and to convince high
school seniors that this institution is a swinging place to attend.

In that case, the University wanted something and went right ahead
and paid for it. In this second example, the students want something‘ and

‘ according to University philosophy, they should go right ahead and pay.

for it.

If students want to see their nationally ranked football team play
on TV, then they should by all means be given the opportunity — providing
the University doesn’t have to foot the bill. ’ ..

But the University should foot the bill, because it is part of its func-
tion to administer to, the wishes of its students. It should also do it if for

A no other reason than to repay the student body for havingto writhe in ‘

front of the Hootenanny cameras.

you’ll have to excuse my typing, but the shift and period keys on the typewriter don't work,

‘All-Around Man . . .

 

University   Scholar

The new-generation student is increasingly’ be-’
coming a specialist, better qualified in his narrow
. ﬁeld of endeavor_ perhaps, but little’ qualified in
anything else. , Down through the ages the most
eminent citizens of the world were those who were
well versed in several.diverse «
fields. The philosophers were,‘
also scientists, theologians and
mathematicians — they'were .,
sensitive people and artists.
They were human beings, con-
cerned with men around them ;
ﬁrst, and anything else only
after this. Now the tables seem 3
to be reversed: the concern for ~‘
advancements in sciences far
transcends the efforts of stu-
dents — the citizens of tomor-
row — to discover themselves in relation to their
fellow men. _ ,

Appreciation of arts does not mean that every
individual must be proﬁcient in one or more cre-
ative endeavors, but rather, that everyone should
be able to derive some aesthetic pleasure from
observing an artistic creation. The experience

 

_which comes out of such pleasures can be far.

more pleasurable and rewarding than even the
explorations into space or some comparable ad-
vancement in the sphere of science. Art_ isfar

more than mere pleasurable sensation — it is a .

mirror of the society and the era. The student
may learn about himself and others by pursuing
the arts.

It goes without saying that in order to be an
intelligent, thinking man, the scholar should be
well prepared in academics. But have a ﬁrm

grasp of events happening around him and some '

deﬁnite ideas about these events. This can be
I partly achieved by conversing with his peers «who

,. ‘have views perhaps contrary ‘to his own. These

  

By Viiay Jain

exchanges of ideas, indulged in with a fairtand

open mind, can broadenthee scholar’s outlook by
presenting opportunity for him to test and adjust‘

his own views, stimulate and "strengthen his own
convictions. " ,

In this respect, conversationstwith persons of
diverse cultural and ethnic backgrounds are, in
many instances, highly informative‘ and give an
international outlook to the scholars convictions
and ideas; '

Finally, having tools such as these at his dis.
posal, the scholar must form and ‘develop his own
set of values and standards. Often the average
college student feels that it ‘is degrading to con-
form or agree with anything traditional that is
said or done by-anyone anywhere at anytime.
Thus in an attempt to escape from being labelled
a conformist, he becomes a typical college con-
formist — a rebel without a cause. The scholar’s

views should be his own synthesis of all his

knowledge and intellect — -and not merely a
reaction.

Needless to say, the true scholar, as opposed,

to the‘ pseudo—intellectual, does not consider him-
self naturally superior to the restof the student
body. But at_the same time he k_nows the relative
value of the advice of his fellow students and
knows the weight that they should carry in in-
ﬂuencing his views. ,

The University realizes the value of a scholar
who is an all-around student. This was shown
at the Fall Convocation when Dr. Frederick Frank’
a dental surgeon, humanitarian, author and artist
was given an honorary doctor of ﬁne arts degree.

The facilities are available at the University
for the scholar, but the students themselves must
make up their minds to abandon their antiquated
ideas that the University is merely a-place to ob-
decide _to become true scholars and sensitive
artists; ° -

the athletic department has to pay a quarter for that seat or something like -that,

‘he wants us to think we’re getting something for nothing but every time we
buy a date ‘ticket aren’t we paying $2.50'to the athletic fund? ,

and then they only let us buy one ticket per game‘ which logically speaking
is kind of=screwy because it looks like 7they’re defeating their own purpose--—
that of making money, don’t ask me why but there’s a limited number of seats available in the student
section at the stadium and for that reasonthe date tickets are‘ limited, - 5

so why don’t they expand the ‘student section, they did it for parents weekend, as a gesture or
something, they reserved almost "700 seats

 

 

for parents to sit in, remember you got achance to use dad’s

I the point is what brings in more proﬁt for them — a $2.50 seat which can be sold, or a $4.00 seat
which might be. sold or may be empty? how many games does carver think are sellouts? the penn

and what? notre dame is an away game this year so i guess he’s willing to settle for 25,000
empty seats in hope of ﬁlling them with $4.00 ticket holders. M , 5
i hear the departments in thegred and i guess that’s pretty hard to swallow since last year

wasn’t so hot for ﬁnances either, but empty seats aren’t going to

I solve any. problems that’s for sure.

they have this youth day here when. they invite high school
kids to the game for special student rates but everybody around here
beefs because that’s like infringing on university activities, somebody
even suggested the university sell date tickets to students of other
area colleges to makemoney’ but this is sort of stupid since they
don’t even have enough to go around here.

i’m not the only one who was refused a date ticket because" of
this limited space and i think this would seem to warrant an expan-
sion of the student section, $2.50 isn’t exactly cheap but when the

students are willing to pay this price and can’t because of limits then 

it’s time to scratch your head a little, ‘

and how about those crazy id cards they gave us with the mug
shots on them, heck now you can’t even pass your id card off to
somebody when you can’t go to the game, they won’t let you just

,ﬂash your invoice, ' -

the whole mess is about as confusing as a mixed metaphor (see
what i learned in lit class), it could be resolved if a certain so-and—so
would take the initiative to expand the student section, ' '

» so what do you think carver’s thinking about these days? he
thinks about ways ‘of attacking “the pitt news” -for distributing free
lineups to‘ the students but does he realize that many of the students
who pick up lineups on friday haveto use them while listening to

‘the game on the radio because of a lack of seating space at the

stadium?

A we have a good football team and we ‘like to watch them play,
in factsome of us like to take a friend along to watch them play so
i guess i’d better get over to the student desk before the date tickets
are sold out, tell everybody i said hello, your son,

Three ‘and four o’clock classes
will be cancelled for the parade
for the first time in years. S

A no t h e r ﬁrst, the Holiday

House, the site of Friday evening’s
activities, is “the best supper club
in Pittsburgh,” accordingto Lan-
dy, an d Tony Martin, who is
scheduled to entertain, is “one of
the three most popular night club
entertainers in the country.” And
“there will be no cover charge!”
Landy added.

In addition the Queen contest
has been expanded this year to
allow non-greek organizations to
nominate candidates.

experience in network operations,
Kleinberg said,, but also the lis-
tening audience at each school
through the more varied program-

tact with contemporaries.

According to Kleinberg, adver-
tisers will have a potential audi-
ence of ﬁve thousand college stu-
dents. Advertising contracted with
the old network will be unaffected
by the revision.

Kleinberg stated that PCB will

be “tightly organized” and will

have its policies determined by
a nine-member executive board
composed of the general manager,
program director _and business
manager of each station. '

Kleinberg voiced optimism and
determination to “add another ac-
complishment not only to WPGH,
the initiator of the network re-
vision, but to the students at the
other two schools as well.”

He _said PCB will begin its

all three schools.

C h e mi s t r y E reﬂected Riﬂ:'ner’s
views and added, “Mr. Arthur has
had many oﬂfers from other bands
and big name musical organiza-
tions, but his close, personal ties
with the bands and the bandsmen

Band director Arthur, himself,
is a soft spoken man who be-
lieves in action and the ﬁnal
product, not words.

“It takes three months of mu-
sic writing, formation, and design
to plan and co-ordinate the fall
program for the Varsity March-
ing Band, “Arthur said. With
Concert Band- and Panther Band
in the fall, Director of the Bands
becomesa 12 month a year job.

Architectural Training Evident

Arthur holds four degrees which
he earned within seven ‘years. In
addition to ‘his B.A. and M.A. in
Music from_ Carnegie Institute of

he holds a B.A. and M.A. in Arch-
itecture from Penn_ State. One
look at the complicated but pre-
cise drawings of marching forma-
tions reflects the exactness of Ar-

each in charge of a specific group
on instruments. The Senior sec-
tion leader and the head of the
operations crew bring this num-
ber to ten. All drill, preparation
of footwork, and training in the
handling of instruments are the
responsibilities of the section

leaders.

In addition ‘they aid in train-
ing new members in the Band's
annual summer camp.

The Concert Band is also doing
its part to spread University good
will. Last winter term the Con-
cert Band toured the Erie-Brad-
ford area. When the band ar-
rived . at Strong Vincent High
School, according to band mem-
ber Ivan Gold, the audience gave
the band a standing ovation—be-
fore’ the program began.

The bandsmen getgno renumer-
ation for their efforts, but they
give their time and effort out of
what Senior Section Leader
Obrycki calls a strong esprite de
corp. The band is planning on
trips to the Navy and Miami
away games, but most important,
according to Arthur, “we hope to
go to one more game after Mi-
ami.” V ' ’ '

To Run for City Council

By MARCIA BERNSTEIN

Jerome J. Brozell, a 1963 graduate of the University who
feels that the “so-called New Frontier has overlooked the
city of Pittsburgh,” is_ running for the City Council on the

Republican ticket.‘

Brozell has been working with the Republican party for
a number of years. While still going to the University he

worked on the election board and

became a committee man. He had 2 _

this opportunity because of the
shortage of Republicans in Pitts-
burgh.

The party wants “new faces to
run for oiﬁces,” noted Brozell.
“They have been running the
same people but for different of-
ﬁces." He also pointed out that
there hasn’t been a Republican
elected to.a Pittsburgh city of-
ﬁce in over 30 years.

Represents a Generation

“I more or less represent a
generation that doesn’t know

 *- what a Republican in Pittsburgh

looks like.”

Brozell stressed that he wants
the city police under civil ser-
vice, as the ﬁremen are, to
“bring°up the standards of the
police department to those of
national standards.” For ex-
ample, the average education
level nationally is high school
graduation, for Pittsburgh it is
,tenth grade.

“To deal with metropolitan

problems, a policeman s h o u 1 d-

have at least a high school‘ edu-
cation. In New York City you
can ﬁnd patrolmen who have
studied sociology in college in
areas where social problems are
prominent. In Pittsburgh, you
wouldn’t ﬁnd a college graduate
walking a beat.” .
Bring Up Department Standards

Putting police department jobs
up the departments standards as
it did in the ﬁre department, ac-
cording to Brozell.

Commenting on the 30 years
of absolute power the Demo-

under civil service would bring"

 

City Council Candidate V

crats have enjoyed, he pointed
out that “the ﬁremen must deal
only with the Democrats. They
can’t play parties_ off against
one another. The‘ Democrats
take everyone for granted. For '
example, they don’t have to
answer, to Negroes for imper-
fect civil rights because they
know that the Negroes will vote
for them anyhow.”

While at the University, Bro-
zell was primarily concerned with
the William Pitt Debate Union.
A North Side commuter who
worked his way through school,
he was also vice-president of
WPDU and a member of Delta
Sigma Rho, honorary speech fra-
ternity. '

Army ROTC Releases Appointment
Of ‘New Military Science Professor E

The University’s Army Reserve
Officer Training Corps (ROTC)
has announced the appointment
of Lt. Colonel Hollis as professor
of military science.

During World War II, Lt.lCol.
Hollis served with an engineer
combat battalion in Europe, taking

_,_,_part in the Rhineland and Central

- European Campaigns. After grad-
uating Oiﬁcer Candidate School in
1942, he participated in the Berlin
Airlift. '

T h e ’ A r m y Commendation
Medal, the United Nations Medal,
the Medal for Humane Action,
and several medals for excellent
work while in Korea, Europe and
Berlin have been awarded him.

May Consider Him Bias ‘

Realizing that students may
consider him bias as a profession-
val army man, he expresses his at-
titude toward national awareness.

“The students’ attitude toward

military service is part of what
seems to be a national trend in
the thinking of many. of our
citizens." " -4

“The. average citizen today is
concerned ,. too much with himself
and matters'of self interest, and is
concerned too little with his re-
sponsibility tohis country, espec-
ially when it involves-some active
personal involvement. .

Everyone Should _ Realize It

‘‘I only wish every college stu-
dent could appreciate _the person-
al sacriﬁce and unselfishness that
is the hallmark of the dedicated,
and could realize the deep person-
al feeling of accomplishment they
derive from it.” ’

One of his hopes is that the
“consciousness of the role of the

citizen,” be discussed publically by L

the SU Forum or some‘similar stu-
dent organization. , — A

For this year, Alpha Phi Omega
(APO) service fraternity, is fol-
lowing its national board sugges-
tions to arange projects for the
University, community, and na-
tion. _

Its national service project will
be helping to organize campus
meetings . to; inform about the
Peace Corps. At the fraternity’s
national convention last December
in Kansas City, R. Sargent Shriver

Jr., Peace Corp’s director, encour-,,

aged chapters to cooperate ‘with
the service objectives of -Peace
Corp’s coordinators on college
campuses.

As a fall campus service pi‘o—.
ject, APO is registering engineers’
slide rules against loss. Also it is
helping to build the queen’s float
for the Homecoming Parade. The
chapter is investigating coopera-
tion with the Central Blood Bank
of Pittsburgh to promote a Uni-
versity blood donor drive.

Close Relationship Needed

On ‘such a project,. chapter pres-
ident David Berkowitz predicted;
“There will be a need for close
relationshipfor service in a large
University.”

run again this winter. Student
voting in the contest (at one

the ‘past two years for Children’s '

Chapter adviser Marshall’ ‘Ab-
rams believes that “some Student
Government projects could - well
be undertaken by APO.” On the
Student. Directory he thinks that,
on the basis of other chapters’
experiences, APO could offer
quicker publication. better print-
ing, more complete student identi-
ﬁcation, and organizations’ oiﬁcer
listings. '

Helped Boy Scouts '

On the community level, the
University chapter has worked
with its, brother chapter at Car-
negie Tech to repair and paint
one of the Pittsburgh Boy Scout
Council’s camps. _

Although the fraternity is not
directly connected with the Boy
Scouts, previous scout member-
ship is required for membership
in APO. " A

Recent pledge projects have
included cleaning of the Cathe-
dral and Student Union lawns
.and making a new chapter em-

that “there is -nothing to prevent ‘

membership in APO as well as
in a social fraternity.”

Alpha Phi Omega was founded
in 1925 at Lafayette, College,
Easton, Pa., by Frank R. Horton,

a Navy officer in World War-I. His '
experience with servicemen in the '

war convinced him of the need to

give college men an opportunity to.

serve college, community, and na-

lion in the tradition of the Boy’

Scouts.

Alumni of the fraternity, college i
officials, and Boy Scout executives-

form the national board of direc-
tors. The fraternity has grown to
353 chapters at American colleges

and 16 aiﬁliated chapters in the

Philippine Islands.

PAT DONNELLY
Navy Fullback

 

  _/Va vy Bwiacikss Show

 

[6aLs;;. '23, 196: ‘

Roger Staubach and the Navy offense

are not synonymous terms. Although

' Staubach leads the Midshipmen in total

offense, he has three other backs running
with him who boast an average of over
four yards a carry.

One of these backs is starting fullback,
Pat Donnelly, a 196-pound junior. Ac_-
cording V to Navy‘ coach Wayne Hardin,
“Donnelly could be the best fullback Navy
ever had." :

Donnelly isplaying to the hilt of Har-
din’s predictions.‘ After four games -he
_averaged 5.6 yards per carry, and rushed
for 230 yards.

“Somewhat of an All-American boy,’
Donnelly is president of his class and a
straight A student. ‘ "

, .

/

When Donnelly is out, Nick Markoff,
at senior from West Milﬁin, Pa., substitutes

-for him. He has rushed for 159 yards’ this

season, and is averaging 6.3 yards per
carry.

Halfback Johnny Sai teams with Don-
nelly and Staubach in the Middies’ rush-
ing attack. According to Hardin, Sai, who
sports a 45-yard per try rushing average,
“has a lot of speed and ability and could
very deﬁnitely take the pressure of Stau-
bach with some long runs.”

Flanker Ed Orr rounds out the Navy V

backﬁeld. A fourth stringer in the spring,
Orr currently leads the Midshipmen in_
pass receiving’ with_ 16 catches for 185
yards. ’

But "Navy has some standouts on the
line, too. Among them-is tackle Jim Free-

man. According to Hardin, Freeman is
one of Navy’s top tackles. “Jim appears
to be as good a tackle as we have had at
Navy,” he said.‘ “He is one of our best
linemen.” -

‘ The 6-2, 211-pound lineman started
over half of Navy’s games last year, and
made All-East for his performance against
Michigan. '

Navy is not a one-man team. Roger

fense but he is not their only back.

    Panther Schedule a
.To Get Tougher

The boys have been met and ‘beaten, now the men must
be faced, That about sizes up the Panther football team.
.Their four easiest games came at the start of the season- Now
they must facela truly rough schedule in Navy, Syracuse,

_Notre Dame, Army, Penn State and Miami. Only_ Miami ranks,

as a weak sister, but a team with George Mira on it is capable
of upsetting any ranking team. The Panthers have their work
cut out for them. ‘
J , * * * '
Leave it to Paul Martha to go one better than anyone else.
Many’ players ’ have thrown the ball into the stands after
' , . . scoring a touchdown. But Martha
topped that by heaving the ball out
of the stadium at Morgantown after
‘ his thrilling 46 yaril tguchdown run.

Martha’s heroics took.--away some
of the credit that belonged to’ his
teammates. Rick Leeson played one
of the finest college games. The all-
American. candidate picked up 86
yards in 11 carries during the after-
noon and snared three passes. Per-
~ - _  haps the coaches are planning to
Bob Smizik utilize Leeson more than they have
been. We know of no better way to open up the offense than
to let Leeson run outside with the ball -or throw them
some screen passes. ’ V

. 4 :0: =0: 1; . ,

Perhaps the ‘best example ‘ of wide-open football
shown by the Panthers this "year was when they went for
the ﬁrst down onfourth down while the ball was on the
West Virginia 18 yard line in the fourth quarter. Coach
John Michelosen said, “We had to get the ball in oper-
ating territory.” . r

    

* * *~ .

The gamble for the ﬁrst down caused Bob Prince, “The
Voice of the Pittsburgh Pirates,” to say on his post-game
television show that Chancellor Litchﬁeld sent in the play.
How ridiculous! The Chancellor has no phone to the bench
and would never consider making such a -move as Prince
suggested. ' T
‘ * * *

The" return of. Bob Long to the Panther lineup ranks as a
miraculous recovery. Michelosen had said that he doubted if
_Long would be able to play at all this season after injuring
his knee in pre-season practice. However, the senior from
Sharon moved back into action by the fourth game. He

F/RED MAZUREK
 Leads Panthers"

ROGER STAUBACI-I‘
_All-American Candidate

A battle of the nation’s top quarterbacks shapes up Sat.

urday at Annapolis where the Panther gridders face Navy _
in a battle for Eastern supremacy and a higher national .

rating.‘ '

Navy quarterback Roger Staubach is. the leading candi- 1

date for all-American honors at the signal-calling position. .

He has a string of press clippingsé

long enough to impress any critic.
These two attributes are due, in
the ﬁrst place, to ability, and in
the second place, to a good press
agent. , ; ,
Mazurek is also long_on ability,
and ‘although his statistics are not
as impressive, as Staubach’s, he
has not seen as much action as the

' Navy star. Mazurek’s press clip-

pings are in. the trash can with
the rest of yesterday’s paper. He.
doesn’t have a press agent whose
pushing him for all-American.
Lead in Olfense

Going into Navy’s game against
Virginia Military Institute last
week Staubach led the nation in
total offense and passing. He had
his poorest day of the season

against VMI gaining .148 yards

through‘ the air. but being held to
a minus one yard rushing. ‘-
Staubach’s press notices read
like they were written for
Jimmy Brown. Michigan coach
Bump Elliott said, “Roger Stau-
bach is a. great football player.
I don’t know when I've ever
seen a better one.”
Southern Methodist coach- Hay-
den Fry _ said, “Staubach is the
ﬁnest offensive quarterback I have

ever, seen in college football.”

.The. list. goes‘ on. and on.j He has

  
 

supplanted George Mira and Tom
Myers, or anyone else who ever
claimed» the title, as the nation’s
number one college‘ quarterback.
Complete 67 Per Cent

Mazurek’s credentials are not as
impressive,‘ but he hasnothing to
be ashamed of. He has completed
32 of 48 passes for 67 per cent and
417 yards. Like Staubach, he was
stopped on the ground last week, '
being held to only one yard. He
has better than a three-yard rush-
ing, average which is good’ con-
sidering the number of times he
has been thrown for a loss while
trying to pass.

The individual battle between
Mazurek and Staubach is actu-
ally only a sidelight to the game
which looms as the biggest in,
the East this year and one of the
biggest in the nation. The: Pan-
thers ‘retained their number

game with West, Virginia and
Navy stayed in the 11th spot

Actually it was a prep school that Stewart was speak-

football. Most of the Manlius graduates go to Army or
Navy, but Stewart along with other Panthers, Bob‘ Guzin-

, In the Mountaineer contest the Cubs really came alive.

'Kicking specialist,.Frank Clark,¢

started the scoring with a 26-
yard field goal in the ﬁrst quar-
ter. From that time, on the Pan-
thers were never in-any danger.
‘During the first half the Pan-
thers stayed mostly on the ground.
Electing to go for a needed ﬁrst
déwn with fourth and one on
the Mountaineer six, quarterback
Ed James kept the -ball and raced
up the middle for the score. It
was the Panthers ﬁrst touchdown
of the season and it gave them

a 10-0—halftime edge.
2‘ .

 

Change Strategy _ p
In the second half, Coach Bill
Kaliden changed his strategy

_ somewhat. “We decided to pass

off of the same type of plays that
we ran earlier,” he stated. Mix-
ing their ground and air attack
in this manner the Cubs main-
tained 'control of the game.
On the ﬁrst oﬂensive play of
the second half, halfback Bob
Dyer sprinted from the Panther
,29 to the WVU 9,_ and on the
next play Dewey Chester‘car-
ried for the score. Clark con-
verted to make it 17-0. The
ﬁnal touchdown came on a 62-

yard pass from James to Pete
Smith. ,
Kaliden has been quite pleased
with his squads performances
thus far. Even though the Navy
score was lopsided, he felt that

his team played well and he was-

very much\ satisﬁed with the WVU
batle. “We have a good group of
boys here,” he said. “We just
need more work.”
Praises Halfbacks

Kaliden singled out Chester and
Dyer for their. exceptional per-
formances so far this year. “These
two have ‘been'running extemely
well,’,’ he said. \

The Cubs will continue their
regular practice procedures this
week. Normally they play the
part of the varsity’s next op-
ponent, and so this week the
freshman will have to run Navy
plays.

Although the schedule is short ‘

all “of the players are gaining
needed experience. This has been
especially, true on offense where
the Cubs have been displaying
a wide and varied attack.

Frosh Soccermen
Top Slippery Rock
At Forbes Field

Last Friday at Forbes Field the
freshman soccer team staged a
come-from-behind effort to edge
the Slippery Rock Junior Varsity,

'3-2.

Early in the ﬁrst quarter Al
Nichtman of Slippery Rock caught
the_Panther defense out of posi-
tion and knocked in two goals
virtually unmolested. N e i t h e r
teams could muster up much of an
offense after that and at the half,
Slippery Rock maintained a 2-0
lead. '

/' However, the aroused Panthers
scored twice in the third period.
Fred Sauer scored ﬁrst and Vince
Bartolott, assisted by Sauer, tied
the game. Finally, in the ‘fourth
quarter, Roger Carlin scored the
go ahead goal on a head’ shot.

Though the score was close,
the freshmen dominated the
game. Even in the ﬁrst half they
outshot Slippery Rock 15-7. The
main problem centered around
the inability of the freshman to
take their time in shooting. I

Standout performances were
turned in by Kermit Wessner,
Bartolata, Sauer, and goalie
Dennis Schweben. Wessner, espe-
cially, stood out defensively. He
continually kicked the ball out of
Panther territory putting Sippery
Rock on the defense: Schweben
made three brilliant saves.

Sage was despondent, only being
able to stammer,” No comment.”

Unlike Smizik, Jim “Jugger-
naut” 0’Brien shows more signs
of life now thathe has climbed
to fourth place. He even took
time to explain his position be-
hind the girls. “This is my per-
verted year,” he said, “the year
to be‘behind the girls.”

Then O’Brien raised his head,
and pointed his right index ﬁnger
toward the sky. “But I shall yet
assume my rightful position,” he
said. “Smizik shall be at my left
flank, and the girls on my right
flank.” "

Marvin “Isaiah” Zelkowitz, al-
though in‘ second »place wore
sackcloth and ashes for his Pitt
News cohorts. Thus spake he unto
them: “Behold, I am in second

Basketball Starts

A new modiﬁed basketball
game has been introduced to the
Intramural Department. T h e s e
games are open to all students
regardless of house afﬁliation.
Dormitory. men can be teamed
with fraternity men, as well as
commuting students.

Three men will comprise each
team. The game is ‘played on one-
half of a basketball court either
at the Stadium gym or the Field
House. '

Contrary to regular basketball
there will be no referees. The‘
game will be played up to 21
points with a basket counting
as two points, and a foul shot one
point. A new rule is that the team
sinking a basket will be allowed
one free foul shot.

The team winning the best out
of three games will be considered
the victors. A team will consist
of a minimum of three and a
maximum of ﬁve men.

Anyone wishing to compete in
the new basketball games-should

‘send a representative to a meet-
