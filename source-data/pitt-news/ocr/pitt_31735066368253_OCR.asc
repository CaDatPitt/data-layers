Bec ker’s Death Will Affect Alcohol Policy  

the problem of alcohol in the 
dorms, the fraternity houses and 9

By (i‘..l-lR|S.TlNA CLINTON

. The death of Pitt football player.
' Todd Becker last December will

have a definite impact on the alco-
hol policy in the dorms——possibly
even a moratorium on parties-
according to Jo Ann Woodson, the
director of the Office of Residence
Life (ORL).

Woodson said she is considering
making a recommendation to Con-
ney Kimbo, the vice-chancellor for
student affairs, to put a morato-
rium on parties in the dorms until
the alcohol problem is investigated
and possible solutions are found.

Becker fell out of a third floor

window of Brackenridge Hall early I.

on Dec. 16 after attending an
unauthorized party on the sixth
floor. His death came hours before
the team was supposed to leave for
Dallas to prepare for the Cotton
Bowl.

Several unanswered questions
still surround Becker's death and
the circumstances that led to it.
One story is that Becker, who _was

banned from all residence halls fol- '

lowing an incident when he was a
freshman, was sneaked into Brack-
enridge by his teammates through
the lobby. Reports_said that he was
hiding in a group of five or six men
and was able to get intoithe dorm.

Another story is that Becker
climbed in a third floor window of
Brackenridge and obtained admis-

L sion that way. That window, near
the Towers, is almost ground_level
and all Becker would have to have
done was climb several steps and he

‘would have been adjacent to the
third floor.

Once inside thebuilding, reports

a _ . said that Becker thought he was

:c_

safe until several staff members of
ORL went to break up the party.
Friends of Becker said he was afraid
that if he were caught, he would
not be able to go to the Cotton

Bowl and would be ‘kicked off the
football team. '

‘Becker then supposedly tried to
climb -out the window that he

T climbed in, but that room was

locked so he went to another room.

G ame Reflects 
  Pitt’sSeason   

By BRIAN BALK.

DALLAS—The flow of the
game was too familiar. Pitt drives
the ball deep into its opponent's
territory. Suddenly, a misfire drops

. into the hands of a defensive back, a

flag is thrown, the ball squirts out
of the hands of a Panther tailback.
The Panther offense, once regarded
as one of the nation’s best, fails to
score when it counts.

This was the story at the 47th
Cotton Bowl Classic. The Panthers
ended their s'eason on a disappoint-
ing note, losing to Southern Meth-
odist 7-3.  P

“This exemplified completely
the way the season went,” said mid-
dle guard ].C. Pelusi, who,~along'
with frge safety Tom Flynn, led the
Panthers with 12 tackles.

One writer asked Pitt coach Foge
Fazio if the game was a “micro-
cosm” of the entire season.

“People ask if this was typical of
our season,“ Fazio said at a post-
game press conference, “We didn’t
get it in when we needed to—a yard
to go and we didn't get it in.”

ground level, thought he could
make the jump,
impact.

At this point, nobody is certain
whether Becker was coherent
enough to know what he was doing
because of the alcohol content in

his blood. The Allegheny County
Cor_o'ner’s office said Becker's alco-
hol level showed that he was
intoxicated.

Last fall, an alcohol task force
was set. tip by Kimbo to investigate

but died on

offense. The Panthers moved to the T g .3.
SMU 39-yard line. Then, on a fake " ”

punt, Panther short
Dukovich raced deep into Mustang
territory. The drive ended abruptly
when tailback Joe McCall fumbled
on the one.

It was yet another difficult game i

for the Panthers- _
The game was played in a sleet

storm. The officiating, according ’ ’ ’
to some players, was questionable; '
Pitt’s defensive unit was penalized,‘

First Pitt Undergraduate

By PEGGY FERRI '

A Pitt political science and
history student is the first Pitt
undergraduate to receive a
Rhodes scholarship, an award
given annually to academically
"outstanding students who are
also involved in sports.

David Frederick was one of

A the 32 Americans selected from

the l,183 applicants to receive

the award, nine were from Ivy
League schools. i

“There wasn’t a precedent for ~
someone from Pitt to‘ win a
Rhodes," Frederick said. “One
interviewer (for the scholar-
ship) told me that being from
Pitt probably hurt my chances
in the beginning. But my per-
formance in the‘ interviews
made up-for it."

Interviews for the Rhodes are

, known to be rigorous, but F red- ,

erick said that his first inter-
view, in Houston, “was not/
antagonistic,'_]but firm.

“They asked some pretty
bizarre questions,” he said.
“For instance, they asked me
about the political impact of
Beethoven’s music. A

“The second interview in
New Orleans was more diffi- —
cult,” Frederick said, “ because
of the procession of questions.” .
Most of the questions, he said,.

were drawn from a book review '  O A’

Originally from San Anto-

re Economic Text Books Distorted?

By PEGGY FERRI

A- columnist in The Pittsburgh
Press recently wrote that the great
majority of college economics texts
are dotted with half-truths and
falsehoods that are supplemented

. by instructors, but to economics

professors at Pitt, the claim is an
old nne.

.According to the column
(“ ‘Right’ Texts on College Eco-
nomics,"l Dec. 24), a survey of 14
college texts is now available. It is
entitled “American Economic
Texts: A Free Market Critique"

and is published by the Young.

-America's Foundation, an offshoot
bf Young Americans For Freedom,
a conservative youth organization.

 Economics professors have
freviewed 14 texts and provided
:_their comments from a free market
perspective. Among those texts
reviewed were “The Economic
;-Problem” by Heilbroner and
+Thurow and texts written by nobel
laureate Paul Samuelson.

“Samuelson has been tilted at for
some time because of his view that

‘ government does have a role and

should use that role in economics,
Dr. Jerome Wells, Pitt professor of
economics said.

“All people have a bias one way
or the other,” Wells explained,
“and there are a number of well-
financed organizations thathave

their own ax to grind.”

Choosing an economic text is
important, but fWells said that the
last thing he looks at is whether the
text is Right or Left.

“The perspective doesn't matter
as much as whether or not it is one
that presents varieties and is just a
good, well-written book,” he said.

Steele Resigns Post;

Replacement Nafned     st’

Recently elected Student
Government Board member
Mark Steele resigned from his
post Dec. 8 because of his future
career and will be replaced by
Mindy Goldberg, who finished
behind Steele in the November
elections, according to SGB
president Mark Downs.

Steele, a junior majoring in
mining engineering, accepted a
position as ‘a laboratory assist-

‘am with Consolidation Coal
Company in West Virginia and
said in his letter of resignation
that he believed that the cooper-
ative internship would offer a
rare opportunity to gain expe-

student's wants to the board.

“His ideas and insights with -
engineers will be missed,"
Downs said. “He had a lot of
ideas and viewpoints in engi-
neering because he served on
the Engineering Student
Cabinet.”

Although Goldberg was the
first alternate, she said she was
“totally surprised" by her
appointment.

“I’m really excited and glad
to have the chance to put my
ideas into action,” Goldberg
said. “I was going to.try even
without being a board member,
but now I will have a greater

rience in a laboratory setting. °P_P0"l1“ilY £0 3-CC0mP1i5h

thought his internship pro- G°ldb91"gW359dged0UtbY27 “-

ity than the Student Gov-
ernment Board," Downs said.
Some board members
expressed hope with Steele's
election because they said he
could convey the engineering

. The survey of college texts
intends to update itself every two

years. Of the books it reviewed in-

its first edition, it found that most
contained misrepresentations and
distortions.

The book, “The Economic
Problem,” was described in the
column as one so Leftist that even
the most liberal economists don’t
use it. Wells said that it is a liberal
text, but added that most econom-
ics do have a political bent and that
a person’s political perspective
depends on how well he thinks the
economy is working.

Although‘ he admitted that no
one can really be objective, Dr.
Jacob Cohen, a Pitt economics pro-
fessor, said that he considers

Samuelson very close to that and .

also as close to a “guru" as one can
get in economics.

“The attack on Samuelson is an
old one,” Cohen explained. “It has
has been going on since 1948."

Samuelson is identified. with
planned economies and fiscal pol-

icy, ideas that conflict with theii

more conservative economic ‘cir-
cles, according to Cohen.

votes in last November’s elec- '
tion. The board will now con-
sist of two females,(Goldberg
and Kathy Brown).

Although Steele will be
missed, Downs said Goldbergis
an excellent replacement.

“Economists disagree," Cohen
explained, “whenthey do, it is on

‘the basis of preference functions

and value judgementsf.’ He added
that these are differences that don’.t
have to have a conspiratorial _b§_is_i_s.
“The criteria for selecting texts,
for me, are adequacy and teachabil-
ity,” Cohen said. Occasionally pie,-
fessors also choose books that they i‘

have written, but Cohen said that;’

/

this is justified. . \ j

The Pitt Book Center carries
books and study guides that have
been reviewed in the survey. "

Cohen said that it's important
that students alwaysbe skeptical
and added that most professors
welcome and encourage debate, in
their classes. ' ‘

there is anyone attendinga .party
that is under 21, alternate beverages

is present. Woodson did not say if
that was the case with the Bracken-
ridge Dart_y.

Although the policy does not
state whetheror not kegs of beer are
allowed in the dorms, Woodson
said that is another point the coin-
mittee will consider.

If a stricter policy is _ adopted,
Woodson said she expects some
violations, but at least there will be
a refined system, as there is with the
visitation policy. "

Another issue that stemmed
from Becker's death was the blocks
that were supposed to be put on all
the dorm windows to prevent resi-
dents from throwing things out the
"windows. T he blocks prevent the
windows from opening all the way. \

“There is no doubt that being
able to say that you're a Rhodes

Applbaum said, “but you do

said. “I’m interested also in

Happy

  New Year!

The week before Christmas andNew Year’s is t

the time when citizens of our nation begin to
think about the new year and how they want it
to be different from the previous one. They
make promises to themselves to better their
lifestyles. These promises are called New Year’s
resolutions.

Researchers and doctors say that making a
resolution can put a strain on a person’s health,
both physical and mental, and bring undue
pressure into his life. Therefore, we propose
resolutions that will not cause too_much strain
and, in some ways, be fun to keep. _

So, if you haven’t make a resolution yet,
resolve:

0 Not to punch, kick, bite or yell at the next
graduate you meet from Joe Paterno’s school of
humility even if. he is bragging about the
National Championship in August.

0 Not to keep saying “he should have gone
for the touchdown” every time you see a picture
of Foge Fazio.

0 Not to put pencil marks on the walls of '7

Schenley Hall and raise Andy Smith’s blood
pressure.

0 To memorize several administrators’
names and faces so that then you see them
around campus you can say hello and make

them wonder for hours who you are and how

"an!
.- ..»2‘
I

they know you.

0» To go to a meeting of the Student Govern- —
ment Board to make sure there is really is one.

0 To go for as long as you can without being

tempted by the neon lights of the “O” (that goes

hand-in-hand with
yourself).

taking better care of

0 Not to throw your empty beer cans at the
Schenley Hall construction workers when they
start, purposefully it seems, jackhammering at
7 am. after you have been drinking all night.

0 To give up Valley Girl talk, preppy wear, ~
E.T. dolls and Tom Selleck posters.

0 To study cookbooks so that when you eat in
the Towers cafeteria you will be able to identify
what i_t is you actually are eating._

0 To go -to all your classes for a week and

make your teachers nervous.

These should be enough to get you started
and keep you on the path to a happier 1983.

Happy New Year!

The Closet Chronicles    

By RAY WUSLICH

The concept of a nuclear freeze is
so simple and such a seemingly
obvious solution that it was bound
to be embraced by Monday morn-
ing diplomats everywhere. The fact
that the arguments about it do not
even begin to address the real issues
of US-Soviet relations, let alone
arms reductions, is apparently
unimportant.

The concept of a freeze is simple.
For those who don’t know, it advo-
cates what the phrase implies, a
freeze of nuclear arsenals at exist-
ing levels. Simple, right? So simple
in fact that what our good presi-
dent has suggested about the freeze
movement must be true; it is
manipulated by communists.

You know communists, always
spreading simple slogans based on
simple ideas to steal the minds of
the people. Things like “from each
according to his ability, to each

’ according to his needs.” Clever

people, those communists.

When you consider nuclear wea-
pons, there is really nothing omi-
nous about them other than that
they are convenient. You push a
button and eliminate life. What
could be more convenient than
that? On a scale of merciful ways to
die,“ nuclear weapons would proba-
bly rank third, behind an overdose
of sleeping pills and lethal injec-
tions. The point here is that man,
in his infinite creative genius, has
created a million or so ways to com-
mit suicide. Why pick on nuclear

But there is apparently some-
thing ‘deeply disturbing about the
thought of being scorched by radia-
tion. It’ is perceived as somehow
being more terrible than being
scorched by napalm or a hot stove,
and so the thought usually produ-

ces one of two reactions, but never

both.

People, in general, either get all
riled up and demand an end to the
arms race or they shrug their

shoulders, smile and say very
sternly, “Don't bother me.” ,
When you think about it, why
would the Russians nuke us any-
way? They want our factories
because theirs don’t work as well.
They want our apple pie and our
Chevrolets, but not us. ‘
So, knowing how fiendishly

clever they are, it is a good bet that.

they would use another method of
attack, say anthrax bombs. Not
only would these nasty little devi-
ces kill our cattle, but most of our
human population as well. Never

like Neanderthal Man gazing in

fire. They know that if they start

Dear Editor:

I am writing in regard to the
recent. decision by the athletic
department to cut men’s volley-
ball and women’s field hockey
from the program. I really can-
not believe a university the size
of Pitt cannot afford to keep
these programs viable. How can
the small state schools afford
them—and softball and lacrosse
as well? How about Penn State?

It not only has the No. 1 foot-
ball team in the nation, butalso.
highly ranked men’s and
women's gymnastics, volleyball
and "swimming teams. Some-
how -it also has funds for a field
hockey team and a softball
team. It seems to me something
iswrong somewhere at Pitt.

<I . have a few suggestions
where $25,000 could be cut from
the budgetand be barely missed _
at all. Why not cut three or four
of the 60.scholarships given to
the football team? I'm sure
some of these players don't
touch _a football in competition
until their senior year anyway.
Better yet, why don't they cut
_$l"0 from each player's spending
money for the three weeks of_
Cotton Bowl preparation, in
Texas. Then. Tim Lewis and
the remainder of the school can
r rest easy, knowing our team
will play its best against SMU
instead of stumbling in from
the night before.

The athletic department cites
» flackof fan support and interest
0 in field hockey and volleyball as
‘reasons for giving them “the
ax.“ I wonder how many fans
would show up for a football
game played at 3:30 p.m. on
Wednesday or even 6:30 p.m. on

Pride Fading Fast

’_ perhaps it's better that they get

enthusiasm the team would
have if the only acknowledg-
ment for its efforts was a small
article in the back of The Pitt
News.-No lights of TV cameras
or even an article in The Press
or Post-Gazette.

\ .

How long would the football
team last if it traveled to its
games in an 18-seat van with a
stipend of $5 for dinner at
McDonalds or Burger King
afterwards? I realize the football
team brings in the most revenue

ball and field hockey teams. But

cut from the program now,
instead of being degraded
further over the next few years.

The pride I had in Pitt upon
graduation is fading fast. First,
it cuts the geography depart-
ment. Now it's the volleyball
and field hockey teams. What’s
next? Maybe the School of _
Health Related Professions
(SHRP), which Pitt threatened
my junior year. How about the
medical school, if.it's as bad as
Dr. Glew suggests?

Being an alumnus and
former field hockey player, I
was an honorary Golden
Panther. Now I find it very dif-
ficult to support a school that
treats-non-revenue and, espe-
cially, women’s sports so
poorly. 'C'mon Pitt, this is the
l980s! Bring back some of that
Panther pride.

Dear Editor: _

Your call for mandatory evalua-
tions of Pitt faculty members (edi-
torial, Nov. 22) is understandable,
but I suggest that a look at the
larger issues might make clearer
why formal evaluations of the sort
now being developed by the Office
for Evalution of Teaching (OET)
tend to create as many new
problmes as they “ solve."

Like others ‘about to occupy the
lower rungs in superior-
subordinate relationships, stu-
dents seek to avoid as much as
possible putting themselves into
situations where they will feel
repressed by something other than
a wholly benign and helpful
authority figure. How much more
beneficial it seems to be able to do
“comparison shopping” with the
campus equivalent of “ Consumer
Report.”

To begin with, the faculty who
resist such formatlization are try-
ing to avoid the same situations the
students fear. University adminis-
trators are determined to set up
such evaluation systems for the
express purpose of making admi-
nistrative determinations as to who
shall be given tenure or denied it
and who shall be given merit pay
raises or denied them.

The concept is the same one that
motivated the federal Civil Service
Reform Act of a few years ago; the
bestlway to encourage" better per-
formance is to threaten workers
with punishment and to devise
ways of collecting evidence that
well enable the adiniiiistrtors to say
to those they punish, .‘_‘g I did not do
this, you did it to yourself."

 EvaluationsNot The

The overall environment is
reflected in the methods used by the
OET in conducting formal evalua-
tions. The instructor is asked to
leave so that students will not be
influenced by his presence in the
room, just as secret ballots protect
voters from reprisals on the part of
those they vote against. With the
best of intentions, the OET merely
becomes the agent for collecting
adverse data that might be useful
for administrators.

There is precious little evidence’
v that performance appraisal sys-

tems ever have worked very well in
any organization, public or pri-
vate. The fact that “ professional
evaluators” have been at work for
many years does not mean they
have solved the problem. If a prob-
lem cannot be solved,no amount of
effort will overcome that
impossibility.

The larger problem, I suggest, is
authority itself. If teachers cannot
possibly know enough to be in
command of students, the same is
true of administrator-faculty rela-
tionships, and merely passing the
buck back and forth accomplishes
nothing. Indeed, the third leg of
the situation at the university is
reflected in the extreme reluctance
of university administrators to

Socrates; Seeing What Sells 

By STEVEPARKS

The restless crowd eagerly awa-
ited the grand opening of The
National Enquirer Hall of Fame.
Very ‘few people noticed the bare-
footed, bearded,‘ toga-clad figure

who casually strolled through the I

crowd and into the building.
Once inside, ‘Socrates stared at
the ‘walls of “Headline Alley."
Such brilliant headlines burst
forth, headlines like “Boy Sees

.Through Ears," “Burt To Wed

Loni, Sally and Dinah In Triple
Ceremony" and “Woman Raped
By UFO Alien Cries, ‘E.T. Come
Home!’ "

“Hey,” a man shouted, running
toward him. “You’re supposed to
be in the ‘Courageous Freaks of
Nature’ display!"

“I’m not a display. Ijust came to
ask some questions," Socrates
answered.

“Then fire away. And while
you're asking,‘ I'll give you the
grand tour," Pete said, leading him
to the ‘Heart Warming’ display.

“What exactly is the purpose of
your newspaper?” asked Socrates.

“We have a very weighty pur-
pose," Pete said in a serious tone.
“Our purpose is to give the public
stories that other papers are afraid
to print. Those stories make'us the
best paper in the world."

“What earth-shattering stories
have you printed lately?" Socrates
asked. ‘

"“The fact thatour government is
secretly hiding its relations with
creatures from outer space!”

“That's incredible,” Socrates
said. “What did the government
say to your charges?"

Answer

endorse wholeheartly any system of
having faculty members evaute
administrators, because the latter
see this as an attempt to subordinte
them. Top-level administrators‘
here want it understood that they,
not faculty, are responsible for eva-
luating deans.

There is no easy solution avala-
ble so long as students and admin-
istrators have somewhat different
objectives. If you want a catalog

tors want evidence that may stand

up in court when  retrenchment".

seems to require faculty dismissals.
One solution attempted in many
schools some years ago was to abol-
ish grading, but this became dys-
function] for students who
couldn't explain to gradute schools
or employershow they had done in
college.

Because there are such serious
implictions in setting up a per-
manent administrtive record of
evaluations, “ word-of-mouth," no
matter how much you may dislike
it, may be the best solution until
the larger problems are faced. I sug-
gest only that you consider the
implictions in taking a_n editorial
stance.

“But The New York Times

lines. The Washington Post

“Big deal. We outsell both of
them combined!”

“Does the number of sales make
you a better paper?” asked Socrates.

“Of course. The greater number
is always better. This country is
based on it," Pete replied with his
hand on his heart.

“just as a matter of interest,
which would you say sells more

Tales for the Weak-Minded?"

“Smut probably,” Pete admit-
ted, turning red. »

“Is Smut ‘a better magazine than

A Fact Weekly?"

“No way! I mean, what good is

it? Fact Weekly gives the people .

what they really need to survive.‘
The other isjust cheap sensational-‘“
ism pretending to be a real maga-
zine," Pete said.

“But what type ‘of stories does
that magazine print?" Socrates‘

— asked.

“Anything that might interest ‘
people, regardless of whether it"s_n

true or not. It's the lowest form of
journalism; all it is after is money."
“Yet it sellsimore than a better
paper," Socrates said. “Now, your
paper outsells some better papers,
and your stories might be consi-_
dered little sensationalism  "
5‘What?" Pete shrieked. “ ‘Mari-
lyn Monroe Speaks From The
Grave’ is solid journalism!”

. “Then if your paper outsells a '_

more factual paper," Socrates con- A
tinued, “is it really any better than
the Smut magazine?”

“Look, you're getting on my
nerves," Pete said;

“So actually, you're not really
out to inform the public, but only
to increase your bank balance!"
Socrates stated proudly.

Pete snapped his fingers to sum-
mon two Tibetan pygmy-giants

with him. :-

Ll Commuter Associa-  

When Pitt commuters walk, drive
or ride the bus onto campus today,
they will face not only a change of
classes, but another, less visible,
change: -the Commuter Affairs
Committee of the Student Govern-
ment Board has established itself as

A “ its own governance ,group——

hopefully a change for the better!

The Commuter Associationn will

_ _ be “a governance group which is a

sub-government structure that
represents the commuter popula-

. tion,” according to Terrence Milani,

associate director of student
activities.

, The association will expand on
programs offered by the old Com-
muter Affairs Committee and will

‘ add some new ‘progams and servi-

ces as well.

qr.vAccording to Florence Kerr,
secretary of the old committee, the
purpose of the committee was “to

"foster complaints from commuters

and take care of problems as best

they could.”

‘Bil-(This was accomplished through a
number of services,including the
“Commuter Bandit” program,

' -tiﬁder which money was budgeted

lfér” committee members to fill
*“e'i{pired meters around the Cathed--

_ ral and Student Union.

p.‘

P‘ ‘The “Bandit” would then leave a
note saying, “This is not a ticket.
You’ve been saved by the Commu-

. _,;_t_ero Bandit.”

 To make life easier for commu-

ters, the committee also sponsored
a‘ “free parking day” once a year
where committee members would
.fill parking meters themselves from
9 a.m. tr 4 p.m.

Before the renovation of the Stu-
dent Union building began, the com-
mittee had a stand with bus

‘ schedules in the lobby.

«Another of its projects included
-having an old PAT bus sit in front of
the Cathedral, in which a man from

A l - ‘the Port Authority answered ques-

tions and handed out bus schedules.

One of the 'committee’s more

' ‘unusual programs—one that the

Commuter Association plans to
continue——is computerized car-
pooling.

Peter Karlovich, a former Pitt stu-
dent, wrote a computer program
matching all of the Pitt commuters,

 according to their location, for car

pools.

Last winter, the committee sent
lists of people in the same area to all
‘undergraduate commuters in the
College of Arts and Sciences. It was
the students’ responsibility to get in
touch with each other.

Although there was little,

response to the program, the Corn-
muter Assocition will probably con-
‘tinue it, according to Kerr."

monthly newspaper published
exclusively for commuters.

‘‘It was very,very small,” said Pat
Guardino, assistant editor of the
Magic Bus. “We printed 6,000
copies, and'I don’t think more than a
1,000 of them were read.”

The Magic Bus dealt with prob-
lems that commuters might face and

-included a lot of satirical stories,

most of which were about the Port
Authority.

Guardino, who is currently editor
of Insights, the newsletter of the Stu-
dent Relations Committee, worked
with only one other person on the
editorial board of the Magic Bus.

“They talk about apathy a lot,”
she said. ‘‘I don’t know why people
are so apathetic.”

Student apathy seems to have
been one of the biggest problems of
the Commuter Affairs Committee.

With nearly two-thirds of the‘
undergraduate CAS students com-
muting from off-campus apartments
or other areas of Pittsburgh, accord-
ing to Milani, there were about 25
members on the committee last
semester.

“I don’t know whether that’s a
publicity. problem or “what,” Kerr
said. “l’ve noticed that some kids
have never even heard of th
committee.” '

Keer discovered the committee
through a friend and admits that “if it
hadn’t been for her, I might never
have heard about it or joined.

“(Another) large problem is not
apathy but commuting,” she said.

“It cuts down on time a lot—_

commuters have to get home, try to

beat rush hour traffic or whatever. ~

She said another reason for lack
of involvement in the committee

Finding a parking space can be a problem for. commuters._

was its association with the Student
Government Board (SGB).

“One of the reasons it isn’t so
popular is that it is a committee of
the student government,” she said.
“Student government has a stigma
around it. Because of that, some
people tend to stay away from stu-
dent government.

“I’m hoping that when it becomes
a governance group in the Winter
Term and gets more publicity,more
people will join because. it will be
more like a commuter club than
anything that has to do with the-
SGB.” '

The Student Government Board
realized last term that the Commu-
ter Affairs Committee needed to
expand its scope, and the board did
away with the committee in favor of
the Commuter Association.

“The overall purpose (of the crea-
tion of the Assocition) is to improve

the quality of campus life for the ‘

commuters,” Milani said. .

The new assocition will make sure
that commuters have fair and equal
access - to all university facilities,
according to Milani. 0‘

One advantage of the committee
becoming its own governance
group, Kerr said, is that they will
receive a larger budget with its new
status.

Kerr hopes the association will
have some activites open to all com-

 

muters, such as dances and get-
togethers.

‘-‘We really can't do anything like A

that as a committee,” she said.

The Commuter Association will
be located on the sixth ﬂoor of the
Student Union building (down the
hall from the former Commuter
Affairs Committee ofﬁce). Plans to

get its governing body established —

are underway.

There will be a board of directors-
appointed, and the members will
interview‘ and appoint officers,
according to Milani.

The Commuter Association will
work hand in hand with the Com-
muter Resource Center, a project
that is still in the developmental
stage but that should be in operation
by Fall Term of 1983.

The Center will include the duties

of the Off-Campus Housing Office _

and will coordinate various pro-
grams and services, such as.the
computerized car pooling.’

Another service the center will
provide will be an information. cen-
ter for commuters. ' * »

One of the most difficult things‘ in’
a large university such as Pitt, Milani
said, is knowing everything about

school‘ facilities. Because commu-'

ters aren’t around a lot, they ﬁnd

«

that their need for this information is ‘

greater. ‘

The Commuter Resource Center
will address and hopefully meet this
need by providing helpful informa-
tion for commuters.

‘Information concerning the Com-

The Art of Being a Commuter

During finals last term, I ran into a
friend with whom I’d lost touch in
the shuffle of school. We said our
hellos, and I noticed he seemed
extremely happy. He also was
minus the 20 lb. knapsack that was-

a previously welded to his ' back. I
asked him how he could smile in the —

midst of ﬁnals.

. He said, “I’ve raised myself from
the lowly ranks of scummuting.”
In other words, he’d moved to

Oakland, never again to be sand-\

wiched on a PAT bus between a
King Kong clone and Son of Sam’s
brother.

‘As a- commuter, I could under-
stand his elation, but I don’t think
commuters should consider them-
selves the scum of the earth, either.
There are pros and cons to living
off-campus, just as there are for
dorm and apa/rtment living.

it —— I think the situation my friend was
trying to capture in a word is that
commuters are the silent majority of

c this university who get up at 6 a.m.

for 8 a.m. classes, rely on our city’s
infamous public transportation sys-
tem, feed those metal monsters
close to four bucks a day and eat

peanut butter and jelly. in the’shad-_

owy corners of the Cathedral of
Learning.

Basically, commuting is a matter
of economics. Many commuters
can't afford to live away from home,
and many work part-time jobs to
supplement summer incomes. It

boils down to a tightly organized

lifestyles of classes, work, study and
fun on the weekends. ‘ "

Carol Edgar, a junior political
science major, arrangesher classes
around her job.

“I work to pay for school,” she
said, “so I adapt my courses to com-
plement my work schedule.” Edgar

said that she takes ﬁve r;ourses-

three days a week, works the rest of
the week and ﬁts study time in late at
night.

The worst part of commuting for
Edgar is wasting valuable time wait-
ing on buses.

“What drives me crazy,” she said,
“is waiting for an hour after school
knowing you have to get to work.
You know you could be doing some-
thing else, like studying for the test
you have the next day, but you just
stand there. You’re a prisoner of

‘ PAT.” ‘

Edgar said that she believes
school would be more fun living on-
campus because commuters are
limited in their chances to meet

‘people.

» In large classes, according to
Edgar, it is hard to branch out, and
as a result, commuters tend to settle
into small groups of friends. From
term to term, those groups are inﬂu-
enced by schedule changes, so com-
muters" are often left with a, lot of
time alone. ‘

The difficulty in meeting people is,

the fraternity and enjoys Pitt’s social
scene. He said that he prefers living
at home because it is convenient for
him to work, and he finds living on

"campus causes his life to become
too entrenched in school.

‘ “The first floor of the Cathedral looks like a refugee
camp during lunch hour. If I eat on the lawn of the”

' Cathedral, I have ants crawling on my sandwich.”

, “I hate commuting,” she’ said. “It
stinks, but I have to. Last term (the
people in the Housing Office) said
they’d put me on the waiting list.
Well, I’m still waiting.”

As far as social life for Pitt com-
muters, the opportunities to join
clubs or stay in Oakland for parties
are limited by work schedules and
transportation. Oakland is not
exactly Disneyland, so buses aren’t
a favorite mode ofinight travel.

Driving is dependent on how
much you like manuevering on the

Parkway when you are drunk or on ,

how easy it is to bid for the family
car. ‘
Dave Justus, a member of Delta

, Phi fraternity, is very involved with

Seezox photo .

“I’m sort of caught between two
things,” he said. “I don’t like the act
of commuting, but I’m glad I live at
home.”

Justus said that there were many
groups he could have joined, but he
felt" the fraternity would-provide last-
ing friendships, regardless of com-
muting, and that was important to
him.

Justus’ chief complaints of com-
muting are the aggravation of put-
ting up with a poor transportation
system that charges highly for buses
that are late, getting up extra-early
to allow for-those late buses and the
lack of places on campus where
commuters can go to relax.

“When they began renovating the
Student Union, they didn’t leave us
anywhere to eat lunch,” he said.

“They should have set some-
where aside for us. I feel guilty
brown-bagging in Burger Chef, and .
the guy that cleans the tables always
looks like he’d like to throw me out.
If I eat on the lawn of the Cathedral, I
have ants crawling on my
sandwich.”

Now that it’s cold, Justus would
be eating frozen pastrami, and
there’s still not much commuters
can do. The first floor of the Cathed-
ral-looks like a refugee camp during
‘lunch hour, as do many of the other
buildings with benches or seating
areas.

About transportation and food
expenses, Tom Fowler, a psychol-
ogy major, said that he believes
commuting doesn’t really save
money.

Fowler plans on living in an apart-
ment next fall because it will cut
down on the hassle of balancing his-
school work and the time he
devotes to his fraternity, Lambda
Chi Alpha.

He said that he also works two
jobs, and with all those activities to
keep him running, he can’t' afford to
waste ”10'or more hours a week
commuting. .

_ “I hate commuting because I lose
a lot of personal time,” Fowler said.
“If you really want to become an
integral part of campus activities,

you almost have.to live in Oakland.” I

"(lIl|\K

_\‘. 1.1

Fowler said that he was lucky as a

freshman commuter because his
fraternity contacted him after h
ﬁlled out a rush card. -

“I wouldn’t have gone to rush

week,” he said, “unless they had
told me about it. It takes a lot of
nerveto reach out, and as a fresh-
man you don’t have nerve.”

Another issue that Fowler said he
finds problems with is the lack of

freedom commuting fosters. Par-»
.ents still feed you, house you and

generally do not see you as an indi-
vidual adult.

“If you live on-campus, _you’re
more free to become an adult,” he
said. “Living at home means you are
still under your parent’sjurisdiction.
It is not bad, it simply makes it
harder to assert yourself.”

Although this may be true, com- I

muting doesn’t interfere with matur-
ity. A dorm student has some
responsibilities, but a commuter has
more.

The fact that so many commuters

' work shows that they have to give a

little extra effort in order to keep. up
their grades. - '~ +;.

With all the complaining commu- —

ters have done, there’s something
pretty important to say in support of
commuting: If they didn’t do it, they
wouldn’t be here. Without them,
Pitt just might not be here, either.

One wouldexpect the opening
home game in a new league would
promote excitement among the
players. For the Pitt Panther bas-
ketball team, it was the opposite as
they lost to Connecticut 71-67 last
night at the Fitzgerald ‘Field
House.

Head coach Roy Chipman
showed his displeasure thoughout
the game and after the game,
exploded with a verbal lashing that
shook the Panther locker room.

When he cooled off, Chipman
admitted the team seemed to be
going through the motions.

. “We were lethargic out there
tonight,” he said. “We played a ter-
rible game. We should have beat
this team on our home court.

“Nobody was prepared to play
physically or emotionally. We had
a 6-9 guy on the wing of the 1-3-1,
and the kid pumped four jump

Farmingdale. Sounds like one of
those small, hick farming com-
munities you find when you're
lost. One of those remote villages
where the homecoming queen
lookslike (or sometimes is) Farmer
_]ones' prize Holstein.

Most people would have little
interest in Farmingdale, New
York. That is, unless you're a
Panther gymnast.

This year, Fanningdale held a
special meaning for the Panthers.

There they captured second place
at the prestigious Fanningdale

It wasn't until the 15:55 mark of
the second half that Pitt came to
life. Chipman went into a man-to-
man defense—a defense used rarely
by the Panthers—to cut into Con-
necticut's 14 point lead.

“I got sick and tired of seeing
them standing around,” Chipman
said. “I wanted to find out who was
loafing and who had courage.”

The board work by forward
Trent Johnson and the defense of
George Allen brought the Panthers
out of their zombie-like state. In the
next ‘ten minutes, Pitt outscored
the Huskies -29-15 with Johnson’s
tip in of his own missed shot tying
the game at 61. I

The Panthers came down the
court seconds later with the_oppor-
tunity to take the lead, but forward
Andre Williams was called for tra-
velling before his 15-foot jumper
ripped the cords.

The Panther gymnasts tallied a

 Mustang
Victory  
.FuIfilIs

  S MU Rides Panthers’ Sad I e, 7-3  

y Mission

3‘, BARRY ZASLOFF

DALLAS—While the game was
played deep down in the Lone Star
State where SMU defeated Pitt 7-3,
Mustang fans share a common
belief that the victory was handed
down from above. They adopted a
slogan last week that-reads some-
thing like this: “SMU can't lose-
they're on a mission from God.”

Maybe they were, for some-
strange things were taking place
down in the Cotton Bowl. Temper-
atures hovered in the low 30s and
the game was played in a sleet
storm. Mother Nature was turning
the playing surface into an ice skat-
ing rink. Pitt took the last fall,
when Mustang quarterback Lance
Mcllhenny ran nine yards for the
game-winning touchdown.

There were numerous reasons to
suspect that SMU had an ample
supply of missionaries by its side.
Could Eric Dickerson, Craig James
and the Pony Express‘ backfield
have been a cover for what was
really behind Mcllhenny and the
Mustangs?

Mission: Yellow flags fell to the
turf all afternoon; most of them
landed on the Panthers. Pitt was
penalized eight times for 74 yards;
SMU twice for 30 yards.

“I don't know what happened,”
said Pitt coach Foge Fazio after-
ward. “I thought the 5 _yard face-
mask penalty was a good call
because he (Tim Lewis) didn't pull

;hi.rn (Eric Dickerson) down with
his face mask. I was disturbed
about the others, especially the
yealls in the first half. I didn’t’like
the. way they were marking the ball
either, but when things go bad,
they go bad.”

"”“Mission: With Pitt leading 3-0
'-late in the third quarter, Mcll-
‘henny was faced with_a third-and-
'l3-situation from the Pitt'29. On a
‘broken play, the Mustang quarter-
back scrambled from the pocket,
'_threw an off-balance pass down-
‘’field and connected with split end
Bobby Leach 20 yards downfield.

Three plays later, »McIlhenny
found Leach‘ again, this time for a
42-yard gain. No doubt this play
was called from above—SMU
coach Bobby Collins said as much
afterward: _

' “I’d like to say it was my idea,"
Collins explained, “but to tell the
truth, Whitey Jordan (offensive
coordinator) called it from the
press box, and I almost vetoed it.
We had second-and-21 with 54
seconds left in the third quarter,
and I argued that we could have
run another play, change ends of
the field and get the wind."-" _.

“But Whitey said Pitt was play-
ing us close, and he thought we
could get it in then. I'm glad I
didn't argue too much."

“I moved inside and then out
and took off for. the flag," Leach
said, "but when Lance let the ball
go, I lost my sense of direction. I
thought I was going to step out of
bounds. After I caught the ball, I
though it was safe to fall down.”

Mcllhenny took over_ from there,
runing the option play into the end
zone.

Mission: Pitt still had chances to
win the game. With John Brown's
miracle catch on the final play of
last year's Sugar Bowl still linger-
ing in the minds of many, Dan

~ Marino was set for Chapter Two.

The scene: Fourth-and-nine
from the SMU 37. God willing, this
year's hero would be flanker
Dwight Collins.

“Surpasses
Underdog  

  Callings

By BARRYIZASLOFF

DALLAS———Reporters huddled
around a Southern Methodist
player shortly after the Mustangs
galloped over Pitt 7-3 in the 47th
Cotton Bowl last Saturday
afternoon.

“Who's that?" one writer asked
another.upon entering the SMU
locker room. “Is he the waterboy?"

“I don't know,” the other ans-
wered. “I can't see him. He's not
tall'enough.”

That's life with Lance Mcll-
henny, SMU'quarterback. Skeptics
say he's too small to throw passes
over a defensive line. The kid isn't
quick enough. Doesn't have the
arm to play major college football.
He has worn those tags since he
came to SMU.

Mcllhenny was the other quar-
terback last Saturday, Pitt’s Dan
Marino was the subject of a lengthy
feature story splattered across the
Cotton Bowl program. Mcllhenny,

,5-ll, 195 lbs., couldn't even be

found in a section entitled, “Play-‘

ers To Watch.”

His team entered the game unde-
feated, yet it was still considereda
slight underdog. Nothing new for
McIlhenny—he's been an under-
dog since the day he tossed his first
30-yard spiral. Great kid, deter-
mined as any who has ever donned
a football jersey. Just unfortunate
he wasn't born with the physical
attributes of a quarterback.

Foge Fazio had other thoughts
before Saturday's game.
asked to evaluate Eric Dickerson,
SMU’s high-powered tailback,,the
Panther coach shifted to the subject
of Mcllhenny.

“So whether we can stop him or
not," Fazio said of Dickerson, “I
don't know. But if you concentrate
on him too much, the guy that we
feel is their leader, the guy that
keeps the drives alive is Mcllhenny.
He's a real winner out there, and he
knows how to run that doggone
offense.... He does the thingsthat
are necessary to win games ' for
them.” _

So while tailbacks Dickerson

and Craig James are stealing the‘
spotlight and running their_way to
fame, Mcllhenny has guided the
Mustangs to 11 wins this season.
‘ Saturday was no different. Mcll-
henny hadn't the gracefulness of a
swan or the bullets of Marino. Pitt
safety Tom Flynn described some
of Mcllhenny *5 passes as “ducks,"
saying that they “quacked allthe
way down thefield." 

J Butthere he was, leading SMU
downfield for a game-winning
touchdown in the fourth quarter.
On a third-and-13 from the Mus-
tang 29, Mcllhenny scrambled

from the pocket and” connected’

with Bobby Leach for a 20-yard
gain.

“I don't know where he gets that
determination," Leach said. '

After Chris Doleman tackled
Leach 11 yards behind scrimmage
on a reverse from Dickerson, Mcll-
henny found Leach 42 yards down-
field at the Pitt 20.

“Lance seems to throw deep bet-
ter than he throws short,” SMU
coach Bobby Collins said. “He’s
not known as a great passer, but if
that's the play we've got to have,
that's the one he gives us."

Three plays later, Mcllhenny

,_sprinted right, faked the option
pitch, broke a Yogi Jones tackle‘
and crossed the goal line. SMU 7,
Pitt 3. _ ‘

Sounds simple, but it wasn't.
Mcllhenny was lassoed twice in the
first quarter, once by Al Wengli-
kowski and later by Ray Weathers-

Although statistics‘ may not indi-

poon. Both times, Pitt was
penalized for unecessary
roughness.

No complaints from Mcllhenny;
he’s not the arguing sort. “They’re
aggressive. That’s their style of
play," he said in-a manner that sug-
gested he‘s not the type easily
intimidated. “That wouldn‘t go
over well in our conference...we
have a different style. I wouldn't
call them cheap shots...just real
aggressive."

the ball is thrown to you, as a
receiver, you have to concentrate
on catching it.” Compton totalled
42 yards in receptions.

The Panther defense was dedi-
cated to shutting down the Mus-
tang’s notorious option play. For
the most part, they were effective.
High-powered Mustang tailback
Eric Dickerson was held to less
than five yards a carry.

One of the few times SMU’s
option play eluded the Panther
defense resulted in a touchdown.

Mcllhenny is aggressive, too.
He’s the kind "that meets a 260-lb.
lineman head—on rather than take
the shortest path to the sideline. He
flings his body at linebackers try-
ing to open a gap for his tailback.
And he waits till the last possible
second before optioning the ball
away, sometimes exposing himself
to a hungry lineman.

In some precincts. the kid that
bleeds enthusiasm has been called a
winner. Still, he is an underdog.
He has been both since his first
start as a freshman in 1980. Texas
was the challenge. That was

Mustang quarterback "Lance McIl-
henny, cut right and scurried over
the goal line to put SMU ahead for
the first time early in the fourth
quarter, 7-3. ‘

“I got faked out,” said Flynn. “I
had a crack at him, but missed him

by three feet.”

losses this season seemed to be

trated deep into Mustang territory.

second—ranked Texas‘ against
SMU, who for so long was at the
bottom of college football.

The Mustangs beat'the Long-
horns 20-6‘ and have lost just two
games since. Mcllhenny has
absorbed the questions of size and
arm strength. He just wins and
says, “I don't care about spirals.”

He often throws" praise at the
opposition and heaps blame upon
himself. Saturday was no different.

“Their defense confused us for
most of the game,” Mcllhenny
said. “I take full blame for the two
fumbled pitches in the first half..It

SMU seven. His pass was tipped
and fell into the hands of free safety
Blane Smith.’

“I should have thrown it away; it
was my fault,” said Marino.

Then, with time running out,
the Panthers were once again

and-nine situation, Marino opted
for flanker Dwight 'Collins.
Although Collins had control of

“This was probably thesweetest
victory that I ever captured,” McIl-
henny added. “This ranks right up

years ago, the Arkansas win last

above those two because this is
something we’ve wanted for so

Panther Wrestlers

By TIM DlNGER

The Panther wrestling team

,returns to the mats against the

Youngstown State Penguins in the
home opener tomorrow at the Fitz-
gerald Field House. The l-0 Panth-

yers expect an easy match against
' , the Penguins, butwon't be looking
.A past them. -

“We're still going to have to be
prepared for this match," assistant
coach Chuck Coryea said. “They're
better than they were last year, but
then again, we're much better
also." '

‘Last year, the Panthers defeated

Youngstown 43-4.

'_“It’s the kind of match that it is

1 important that the individuals are

prepared,”. Coryea said. “They're
the kind of team that we don't

‘ really know that much about, so we

can't say where their strong or
weak spots are.”

Eyeing Penguins‘

Although the final Panther
lineup is incomplete, the coaches
have a-general idea of who will
start tomorrow.

Freshman Kyle Nellis (7-2) will
take the mat for Pitt at the I18-lb.
weight class. Nellis placed third at
the Wilkes-Barre Open tourna-
ment over winter break.

At the I26-lb. weightclass, either
sophomore Rich Esswien (3-4) or
freshman John Hnath (1-2) will
wrestle, while Panther captain Joe

Throckmortori (6-2) gets the call at _

134 lbs.

It will be either junior Craig
Richey (1-0) or freshman Gary Bol-

_ iris (2-2) at 142 lbs., and freshman -

Joe Bond (4-2)’is the likely’ candi-
date at 150 lbs. — -

At 158 lbs., sophomore Doug

Haines (4-2) will start, and at 167 I

lbs., it will be Jeff Jelic (7:2).
At 177 lbs., Frank Rich.(3-2) will
see action, and senior Kurt Karano-

(2-3) closes out the Panther lineup;

“We can't ‘overlook’ (Young-

big match coming up on Saturday
with Missouri but still have to

think about this match.
“The real meat of the season is

here, and we're really optimistic

about the next few weeks. We've
got to stay healthy and continue to
improve. Everything comes down

' to the EWL tournament at the end
"of the year, but we've got to start

The Youngstown match will
beginat 8 p.m. tomorrow night.
The Panthers then travel to Way-

come. Jan. 11, when West Virginia
comes to town.

Track Team Relishes Recent   Achievements

By CHARLIE C)'HARA

_ , Almost a month has passed since
the Pitt Panthertrack team last saw

action, but there were some out-
standing achievements during the
meet.

  
  
   

Competing against the likes of
;t eorgetown, Navy, Maryland and
organ State, the Panthers
 hieved what amounts to one of
 university's most successful
 door meets ever. They shattered
 e school records while tying, a
f"xth. Panthers qualified for the

Following the day's events, a
very pleased head coach John Vas-

Junior Totld Colas turned in the

best perfoimance by a Panther-
when he won the 1,000-meter run *

in 2:235, breaking a school record,
setting the nation's fastest time and
qualifying for the NCAA
I championships.

Senior Darren Geary took first
place in the 800—ineter run with a
time of l:52.2, which qualified him
for the IC4A championships. The

he qualified for the IC4A meet.
Although they didn't set any

pionships, several other Panthers

‘performed well. In the 1500-meter,

run, Garland Brown placed third,

,_ while Mickey Rihtarchik finished
‘fourth in the 1,000-meter run.

Mario Joyner narrowly missed

Invitational. ~

Chipman Hot At Loss;

each while Hobbs added 10. ‘
Part of Pitt's comeback can be
attributed -to foul problems that
plagued the Huskies in the second
half. Bailey and center Bruce Kuc-
zenski each had four fouls while
Larry Blucher and Mike Vaughan
had three each. . A ' «
“They had to stay away from the

‘ . action," Perno said.

Even through Clyde Vaughan
lead the Panthers in scoring as
usual with 18 points, it wasn't a
typical Vaughan performance.
Connecticut keyed on Vaughan,
taking the 6-4 junior forward out of
his game. The results were evident:
6 for 15 from the floor and a general
feeling of frustration.

“Clyde got 18 points, but he had
to work for those points," Perno
said. -

The efforts of Williams and
Johnson, who scored 16 and 13

points while grabbing.nine and
eight rebounds didn't relieve the
pressure on Vaughan. 2

“The middle was open, but they
missed alot of easy shots,_” Chip-
man said. _ - - -

The loss was not a good sign for
the-Panthers asvthey go into the
thick of the Big East schedule.

“This is not an easy place_to
play," Perno’ said. “In fact,‘ no
place in the Big East is an easy
place to play. lfeel fortunate to win
this game.”

“We should have beaten- this
team,” Chipman said. “If we can't,

_ beat Connecticut at home, then it

would be difficult to beat them up
on their home court. .
“And some games are going to be
tough even ifqwe play our best.”
If Pitt contines to sleepwalk on
the court, Georgetown, Villanova,
etc. will have a field day—-
compliments of the Panthers.

Swimmers Training   Key To Finding Success

By MARK A. SIINDLERC I

Mention the month of December

ably the first thought that comes to

four weeks ‘of vacation is usually
equated with relaxation, an oppor-
tunity_ to “make; money or the

Marina stepped back and hurled
a pass toward Collins who was cut-
' ting toward the sideline. It was a bit
underthrown, so Collins slid to the
turf. -He had it, that is until his
hands cracked the ground, which
forced the ball out of his grasp. It
was one of numerous droppe
passes of the day. i
"I don't know how may dropped
balls and how many receivers fell
when they were breaking on the
ball,” Fazio said,‘ “but that's part of
the game. I don't know if I've ever
seen, as many dropped balls and
receiver slips as I did today.”
, "We more or less just couldn't

,, hold onto the ball today,” Collins

said. “It wasn’t that we were drop-
ping the passes—we just couldn't
hold onto the ball. Today was a bad
day for us.” i
“It was exactly the type of season
we had this year,” Collins added.
. “The dropped ball at the goal line,
the interception in the end zone.
I'm happy forthem (SMU) but, on
any given dry day, we should have
won the game."

- ‘have been spending inordinate-

amounts of time preparing for the
crux of their seasons.

After engaging his team in its
first meet in November, Panther
coach Fred Lewis kept his team
here until Dec. 19 for practice and
an openinvitational. '

T The invitational, Dec. 17-19,
brought apprgoximately 1,100
swimmers to Trees Hall from states
including New Jersey, New York,
Maryland and Virginia. '

“It was a showcase of our facility
to potential recruits on the East
Coast," Lewis said. “One team
brought 115 members."

Those attending the meet were
from high schools and colleges and
swam for both schools and clubs.

After Lewis had his swimmers
doing two-a—days before the invita-
tional, he had the entire squad back
on Dec. 27. Since then, the team has
gone through drills totaling" ‘‘l8,
l9 and 20,000 yards a day.”

He continued, “We’ve had two
practices a day...two (hours) in the

morning, two and a half in the ‘

afternoon and about an hour each
day working with the weights.”
Lewis also adds that his training
schedule includes about one half-
hour of flexibility exercises, total-
ing six hours of training each day.

This intensity is needed as Lewis
prepares his squad for a big match-
up with Penn State come Jan. 15 at
Trees Pool, with several key
swimmers hurt.

Out with injuries currently are:
sophomore Greg Murphy‘ (ear
injury), freshman Donnie Martin
(mononucleosis), sophomore
Doug Condori (hyperextended
ankle) and junior Ed Bahan (flu).

All‘ have been missing from prac-
tice sessions for about a week, leav-
ling Lewis with a lot of soul
searching.

“I’m concerned,” he said.
“Swimming is training; it’s prac-
tice, involving pure conditioning.
The name of the game is staying in
shape.” ‘

“But the longer you're out, the
longer it takes to get back. This
isn't stop-and-go like some other
sports; swimming involves contin-
ual conditioningf,’ V

The Penn State team is one that

is “depth oriented," Lewis said. -

Lewis does not now know what
kind of condition his squad will be
in come Jan. 15.

“Anything (the presently
injured swimmers) do is a plus fac-
tor for us," he conceded. '

Whereas the men’s team is 1-0
(earlier winning over Kent State)
Lady Panther coach Dave Belo-

wich is currently saddling an 0-3
team that arrives home from
Puerto Rico tonight after complet-
ing its annual Christmas training.
_His predicament, needless to say, is
a deep one. I

His squad, too, is preparing for a
showdown with Penn State on Jan.
15. Despite the dismal record,
though, one of the swimmers on
whom Belowich will be counting
is Sue Heon.

She qualified for Eastern region-
als when she broke her old mark in

the 500-yard backstroke against
Syracuse with a-41:57.9 time.
Against Tennessee, Heon set a_ new

school record in the 200-yard back- "

stroke with a 2208.4 time.

When Lewis refortifies his
injured squad and after Belowich
completes some shuffling or what-
ever is needed to peak over .500, Pitt
swimming will look back at the
month of December as perhaps a
contributing factor to now-absent
success.
