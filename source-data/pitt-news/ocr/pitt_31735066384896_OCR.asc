Staff Writer

Headed by founder and execu-
tive director Donald E. Wildmon,
the American Family Association
(AFA), is organizing its members
in Pittsburgh for a September 10
kick off rally for the newly
declared Pornography Awareness
Day.-

\One of the main issues of the
day will be the movie The Last
Temptation of Christ as Wildmon

is currently organizing a nation-
wide battle against the movie.

”We're just voicing our opin-
ion Iike everybody should,” said
Clarence H. Mc Millan, President
of the local chapter of the AFA.

Mc Millan said that -around
3500 people marched to King's
Court when the local
theater started showing the
movie. He also said that the AFA
got 600 people to sign a petition,
to be given to King's Court, ob-
jecting to the film.

When asked to respond, Cine-

movie .

ma World, who owns King's
Court, said that people wanting
to see the film have a right to
attend.

Mc Millan said the biggest
problem he has with The Last
Temptation of Christ is sex. ”Sex
outside marriage is called sin,”
said Mc_ Millan and the movie
does show Jesus having sex with
Mary Magdalene.

In a news release, Mc Millan
said that Temptation ”shows Je-
sus to be a weak, vacillating trai-
tor to the Jews, aniadulterer; a

sinner; but depicts Judas as a man
of intergrity."

Since it's opening, Temptation
has recieved some favorable
reviews. Joel Siegel of Good
Morning America said the movie
‘was ”deeply felt and faith affirm-
ing.” George Anderson of the
Pittsburgh Post—Gazette said it
was ”a serious film, a work of
probing intellect and sincere
faith.” ‘

Although he hasn't actually
seen the movie, Mc Millan said

Jackson, Myers seek to end racial problemsat Pitt

By Brendan Kevenides
Staff Writer

Racial relation problems at the
University of Pittsburgh must be
attacked, according to Craig Jack-
son, president of Pitt's Student
Government Board.

Jackson further commented
that prejudice is sometimes unes-
capable and, in some circum-
stances, expedient.

”S0me racial incidents are not
unfounded," said Jackson.

He explained that, although in-
cidents such as the racially moti-
vated attack in Howard Beach,
N.Y., in which two black people

died are tragic, many events in
which whites are attacked by
blacks go unreported and un-
thought about.

’’It bothers me,” said Jackson,
"but if you say something like
that, you're called a bigot. The
door must swing both ways.”

Jackson's comments come in
the wake of a year marred by ra-
cial attacks across the nation's
campuses.

”[At Pitt] The problem, [of racial
tension] is mostly with black high
school students, the juveniles, "
he said.

Jackson said that these
problems may have arisen be-

cause the city offers no adequate
facilities for the black youths who
congregate in Oakland. He said
that, as of late, Oakland is be-
coming overcrowded with peo-
ple who simply have nothing to
do.

Celeste Myers, chairperson of
Pitt's Black Action Society, dis-
agreed with Jackson.

She said that those blacks who
attack whites simply carry the
color black and the entire race
should not be generalized.

Myers said that stereotypes
must not be allowed to develop
and that ”a line has to be drawn
about whether an incident is ra-

_ciaI or not."

She offered no further explana-
tion as to where that line should
be drawn.

Myers explained that a great
many factors contribute to ra-
cism. She said that it is sometimes
difficult for students who come
from non-segregated communi-
ties to enter the racial diversity
which abounds at Pitt.

’’It depends on how strong an
.individual’s mind is. I would
never carry any individuaI’s ac-
tions to a whole race,” she said

Jackson said that racial tensions
sometimes arise when ethnic

Board
suggests
phone
increase

By William Young

Managing Editor

If all goes well, the Student
Government Board (SGB) wants
to see campus phones installed in
all university buildings. Present-
Iy, there are no public access
campus phones in university

buildings other than the dorms

and the William Pitt Union.
According to board member
Kyle Durham, the board intends

/ to write letters to the departments

that occupy the buildings urging
them to install the phones. If that
d0esn'twork, Durham said that
the board will have to get a peti-
tion signed by students showing
the departments that there is a
need for more campus phones.

”We _have to write letters to the
departments that are the sole oc-
cupants of the building,” Durham
said, "but if that doesn't work,

we'll have to do a petition show-I ’

ing that there is a need.”
Durham indicated that part of
the reason, that campus phones
weren't installed in the past was
that she didn't think previous
SGB administrations had thought

‘of the idea. Another factor is cost,

as there is no single department
at Pittthat can install the phones,
forcing each building to pay for
the campus phones’ installment
and maintenance.

’’It’s not just something you can
go up to the administration and
say, ‘Hey, put in ‘some more
phones,’ so we have to go to each
separate department,” Durham
said. _

”Somebody has to pay [for
phone installation], and since
there's no one department that
does that, we have to go to each
of them,” Durham said.

Another important topic dis-*
cussed during yesterday's meet-

ing was the revision of the
board's constitution. The consti-
tution, last -revised in 1979,
governs and directs the actions of
the SGB and dictates proper
procedures the board. must use.

”lt’s an old constitution and
needs to be updated a little bit,”
said board member Daryl
Grecich.

The primary changes, accord-
ing to Grecich, have to do with
impeachment of Board members,
replacement of committee mem-
bers and succession to the
presidency if a president has been
removed or cannot fulfill his
term.

Explosion at lohnsto wn campusinjures twelve

JOHNSTOWN, Pa. (AP) -
Twelve construction workers
were injured yesterday when an
explosion ripped through an
aquatic center at the University of
Pittsburgh's Johnstown campus,
officials said.

Two of the workers, James
Walker, 45, and Roger Musser,
31, both of Somerset, were flown
to Mercy Hospital in Pittsburgh,
where they were in critical but

stable condition, said Mary

Jeanne Krob, director of the burn
unit.

Both were admitted with
second— and third-degree burns
over at least 25 percent of their
bodies, she said.

Atjohnstown Memorial Hospi-
tal, four workers were admitted to
the intensive care unit and one
worker was in fair condition.

Two other workers were in sta-
ble condition at Windber Hospi-

tal in Johnstown.

Three workers were treated at
various hospitals and released.

The workers, who are em-
ployees of several different con-
struction companies, were
working at the $1.5 million Za-
mias Aquatic Center around 3
p.m. when the explosion oc-
curred.

It isn’t yet known what caused
the explosion, although universi-
ty officials said a natural gas line
to the building was tested and ap-
proved just before the blast.

The state police fire marshal
was investigating.

In a 153-page set of proposed

0f the “ext debate The election is great fun now

The story says almost too much about this year's election.‘
In The New York Times yesterday, there was a description of“
the negotiations between Susan Estrich, the Dukakis campaign
manager, and James Baker, who holds a similar position in the

Bush organization.

Estrich said that the Republicans were unwilling to agree to
a televised debate late in the campaign because, she said, Bush's
managers felt he ”wouldn’t have time to recover from any mis-

takes he might make.”

"Dukakis is anxious to debate. He's trained in this line of
work,” Craig Fuller, the Bush chief of staff, said. ”It’s an area
of his expertise.” It seems that Bush used to be anxious to de-
bate, back in April, but that's all different now. ‘

Dukakis wants to have four debates between the candidates
and one debate between the running mates. Bush would like
to see two debates between the candidates and possibly one

between the running mates.

It seems ridiculous for a person, any person who would be

* president, who would assume themselves to be ready for what

many call one of the most important jobs in the world, to hesi-
tate to engage in a face-to-face debate. A president should be
sure of himself and of his command of the issues. When the
debates are debated, the only winners are the cartoonists.

Dukakis campaign was lifted from Kinnock’s primer

LONDON — Neil Kinnock, the
leader of Britain's Labor Party,
has become a pretty popular fel-
low among American Democrat-
ic politicians. First, Joe Biden
plagiarized parts of a Kinnock
speech. And now Michael
Dukakis is adapting Kinnock’s
campaign strategy in hopes that
it will work better on the western
side of the Atlantic.

As the British press has noted,
the similarities are striking be-
tween the liberal Kinnock’s failed
attempt last year to dethrone the
Conservative Party leader and
Prime Minister Margaret Thatch-
er and Dukakis’ goal to end eight
years of conservative Republican
domination of the White House.

Like Kinnock’s party, Dukakis
had lost two previous attempts to
grab power.

Like Kinnock, Dukakis has
adopted a strategy designed to re-
cast him as a centrist and not the
same liberal today as he was
yesterday.

One liberal American colum-
nist is already helping Dukakis
promote this line. James Reston

engaged in political syncretism in
a New York Times column when
he asserted, ”Mr. Bush and Mr.
Dukakis are middle-of-the-
roaders.”

In the 1987 race, Kinnock and
his friends in the British press
tried to transform his ultra-liberal
image. ‘Not an easy task. Kinnock
was the only member of Parlia-
ment rising to sing the Com-
munist anthem, ”The Red Flag,”
on the floor of the House of
Commons.

His handlers tried to bury Mr.
Kinnock’s liberal past, which in-
cluded support for scrapping Bri-
tain's nuclear defense and
suggestions that, should a foreign
power occupy British so'iI, Britain
could marshal in defense a well-
trained guerrilla force.

Conservatives buried Kinnock
with a poster showing a British
soldier with his hands raised. The
caption read, ”Labor’s policy on
arms.”

Now Dukakis’ membership in
nuclear disarmament and
”peace” groups is being publi-
cized, and at least one observer

There is relief in the air. There
is near jubilation in the press.

When the nominating process
was stumbling along, we all com-
plained that the various offerings
were simply too boring for
words. By the time the candidates
for November had been decided,
America was in a comatose state.

There was a small ray of hope,
actually a harbinger of happiness,
when the running mates were
selected. Lloyd Bensten was a
conservative, at least as conserva-
tive as many Republicans. What
would Dukakis do about the is-
sues on which the two men
differed? What would happen

here is not fooled by what he sees
as an attempt by Dukakis to pre-
tend his past never existed. Writ-
ing in the Sunday Times, British
columnist Brian Walden views
the Dukakis campaign as a type
of Labor Party road show which,
if it works for Dukakis, could be
brought back to center stage in
London.

Writing of the response to
Dukakis by the American press,
Walden sees a replay of the love
affair much of the British press
had with Kinnock: ’’Already, a
serious case of Dukakis mania
has broken out in the newspapers
and intellectual journals of the
left. It is not that Dukakis is
regarded with affection and at»
proval, but he does seem to have
found a way of winning the votes
of the gullible.”

Walden sees the goals of the
American left as identical to those

that wanted to act like a hawk but

I really was a pigeon. But he didn't

burn the American flag, at least.

Since the ice was broken with
the vice presidential jokes, the
presidential election party has
started to get lively. Michael
Dukakis says that because his
rival knew about the sale of arms
to Iran and condoned. it, his
-claims to foreign policy ex-
perience were worth very little.

of the British left: To say anything,
whether they intend to follow
through or not, to regain power.

”The Labor party is so demoral-
ized by the results of its Ieft—wing
adventure, and so eager to lay its
hands on the loaves and fishes of
office, that it may be prepared to
come to terms with capitalism,
providing it does not have to em-
brace it too openly.”

Does that describe the yearn-
ings of the left-leaning Democrat-
ic Party leadership?

Walden notes that the
Democratic party ”also fell into
the hands of the activists, and the
achievement of Dukakis has been
to rescue it for the power—seekers.
He (Dukakis) oozes moderation
and Thatcherite financial recti-
tude from every pore and, in
LLoyd Ben_sten, has selected a
running mate more conservative
than George Bush.”

Walden calls the Democratic
approach (as he called the Kin-
nock approach) ”a miserable
fraud which, if Dukakis wins, will

Dukakis is a (gasp!) liberal. Ge-
orge Bush is a (gulp!) wimp. Both
have been tagged with the ulti-
mate affront to American media-
enhanced perception: they're

Dukakis has started to wonder
out loud whether George Bush
had ties to the contras and to
Manuel Noriega that he doesn't
want to talk about. George Bush
stands next to Jesse Helms and
bemoans Dukakis for ”not allow-
ing” teachers to lead students in
the Pledge of Allegiance. (Actu-
ally, Dukakis vetoed a bill that
would require teachers to lead
the pledge, which is a slightly
different issue.)

Dukakis wants to make the
campaign one of issues, rather
than ideolo8Y, because that's
what he knows best. Bush, on the

Two Jewish leaders accuse Maximos of anti-semitism  

ALLENTOWN, Pa. (AP) ~ Two
Jewish leaders claim Bishop Max-
imos is anti-Semetic because the
Greek Orthodox leader told
parishioners in three states The
Last Temptation of Christ was
produced by ”those who first cru-
cified Christ.”

Barry Morrison, regional direc-
of the Anti-Defamation
League of B’nai B’rith, and Rab-
bi Eugene A. Wernick, head of
Temple Beth El, Allentown, said
Maximos’ letter to his diocese’s
60,000 parishioners blames Jews
for Christ's death and the film's
creation.

”We regard the bishop's state-
ment as outrageous, and it once
again raises the rejected notion
that Jews are responsible for the
crucifixion of Christ," Morrison
said.

”To blame the Jews for thefilm
is a reflection on the ignorance
and medievalism of the people
who would make such remarks,”
said Wernick.

Maximos, whose Pittsburgh di-
ocese covers most of Pennsylva-
nia, Ohio and West Virginia, said
the letter was not anti—Semitic and
apologized.

”They can take everything as
anti—Semitic,” Maximos said. ”I
love dearly and have great. Jew-

Villagers,
Israelis
drive back
guerrillas

JERUSALEM (AP) — Lebanese
villagers helped Israeli troops and
local militia drive back a Pales-
tinian guerrilla squad trying to in-
filtrate Israel Tuesday, the army
and Israel radio said. Two guer-
rillas were captured and two
escaped.

In the occupied West Bank and

Gaza Strip, Palestinians began a I

t.wo-day strike to protest deporta-

‘ tions. Arab hospital officials said

troops wounded 12 Palestinians
in West Bank clashes, 10 of them
in Nablus.

The infiltration attempt was the
17th reported since Palestinians
began rebelling against Israeli
rule nearly nine months ago.

The uprising has killed 255
Palestinians and four l,sraelis
since Dec. 8.

Israel radio identified the guer-
rillas as members of a small pro-
Syrian Palestinian faction, the
Popular Struggle Front.

A firefight broke out after Le-
banese villagers from Khalata, 24
miles north of the Israeli border,
spotted the squad walking out of
a ravine and moving across a
field, Israel radio and military
sources said.

Ten Lebanese men in the vil-
lage armed themselves and vil-
lagers summoned Lebanese
militiamen from the mostly Chris-

’tian South Lebanon Army, who

were backed by Israeli troops
from border zone patrols, the
reports said.

The army said two guerrillas I

were captured and two escaped,
one after being wounded.

Two Lebanese militiamen were
slightly wounded, the radio said.

ish friends_and I don't want to‘in-
criminate my friends and those
working here. I was just defend-
ing my faith.”

The two-page letter Maximos
issued Aug. 22 urged church
members not to see The Last
Temptation of Christ because the
film repeats the heresy that Jesus
had primarily a human personal-
ity. The letter was intended to be
read last Sunday in the diocese’s
50 parishes.

In urging parishioners to avoid
the film, Maximos cautioned
them to avoid the mistakes of the
film's producers, without naming
them.

”None of you will honor a
movie that dishonors Christiani-
ty and the leader of our faith, thus
falling in the pitfall of the
blasphemous producers,” Maxi-
mos wrote. ”By the way, you
may wish to know that these last
ones are with those who first cru-
cified Christ. They now try to do
it a second time! Who of us Chris-
tians in his or her right mind
would accept to be part of that
crime?”

521-2970

Maximos, however, denied
any -anti-Semitic intent and said
the statement was aimed solely at
the filmmakers for perpetuating
the notions of Nestorus, a 5th-
century patriarch of Constantino-
ple who taught that Christ was
primarily human. The Greek Or-
thodox Church has condemned
as heretical the 1955 novel by
Greek author Nikos Kazantzakis
on which the film is based.

”The first people who crucified
Christ made the mistake that he
was human,” Maximos said.
"That's what the sentence means,

BL%M COUNTY

nothing else."

Maximos, who has seen ex-
cerpts of the film, said he wrote
the letter under a deadline. He
said he may issue a second letter
to clarify his remarks.

The film's release this summer
led to demonstrations with anti-
Semitic overtones. About 200
fundamentalist Christians
marched outside Universal Stu-
dios in Universal City, Calif., July
16 and called on Lew Wasser-
man, chairman of Universal’s
parent company, MCA lnc., to
withdraw the film. ”These Jewish

by Berke Breathed

producers with a lot of money are.
taking a swipe at our religion,"
said R.L. Hymers Jr., the minister
who organized the protest.

Martin Scorsese, a former Ro-
man Catholic seminarian, direct-
ed the film.

Wernick said he thi_nks Maxi-
mos’ statement does not reflect
the beliefs of most Greek Ortho-
dox Church members. ”I believe
the person who issued the letter
does not speak for the many over-
whelming number of members of
his church and people who are of
good will,” he said.

UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Pitt and UNI face-off in battle of Panthers

By Vince Carey

Sports Editor

On Saturday, for the first time
in history, the Panthers of Pitt will
take on another team named Pan-
thers, this one from Northern
Iowa.

Northern Iowa made big news
a few months ago when they
hired exiled Ohio State coach
Earl Bruce to lead the squad.

”It’s kind of chaotic right now,”
Bruce said. ”I’m trying to learn
the player’s names and every-
thing. From the UNI standpoint,
it's tough when you haven't had
spring ball, but we are going to
do the best we can.”

UNI finished last season 10-4,
winning the Gateway Conference
with a perfect 6-0 record and ad-
vancing to the division 1-AA
semifinals.

”We are very inexperienced
coming‘ into this game,” Pitt
Coach Mike Gottfried said. ”We
only have 12 seniors —— they are
going to have to give us leader-
ship onand off the field for us to
be the kind of football team we
want to be.

”Northern Iowa is a well
coached football team, they have
been for a number of years. They

have experience and we are look-
ing forward to a good game,"
Gottfried said.

UNI will start 13 seniors,»in-
cluding all five offensive linemen,
with various amounts of ex-
perience.

”A lot of people got the chance
to play last season,” Bruce said
”That helps a little bit now. We
are trying to change a few things,
but you can’t change ex-
perience.”

Northern‘ Iowa is not exactly
new to Division I. Last season,
they lost to Minnesota 24-7 and
Iowa State 39-38.

"The coaching change has set
us back a bit,” Bruce said. ”I
think if Darrell Mudra [UNI
coach 1983-1987] was still here,
the guys would be a little more
prepared for the Pitt game.

’’I don't think it will be asking
quite a lot to play hard and do as
well as we possibly can against
Pitt. Knowing full well that we're
at a tremendous disadvantage
with the coaching change and
everything.”

Because of the coaching
change at UNI, Pitt really doesn't
know what they will be seeing
Saturday night.

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, September I, I988

Vikings to blossom in tough NFC Central

By Thomas Danyluk

Staff Writer

0 THE NFC EAST
Last year, the New York Giants

_ suffered the worst Super Bowl

hangover in league history. After
winning 17 of 19 games in 1986,
including an overwhelming
39-20 romp over Denver for the
NFL title, the Giants bottomed
out in '87, losing six of their first
seven and finishing 6-9. Of
course, losing all three strike
games contributed to the regular
players’ lack of momentum, but
the Giants just weren't them-
selves regardless.

And just when things started to
look up for coach Bill Parcells’
club, A||—Pro linebacker
Lawrence Taylor goes out and
spends the money he. earned
from his autobiography in cul-
tivating his old drug habit.

Still, the Giants are the most
defensively sound team in foot-
ball. Linebacker Carl Banks’ train-
ing camp holdout will keep him
off track until late September, but
Byron Hunt, Harry Carson and
Andy Headen should keep the
unit solid.

Running back Joe Morris had
an off year in 1987, rushing for
only 658 yards, compared to his
total of 1,516 from the previous
year; a revamped offensive line
should help his cause. There's
just barely enough talent here to
unseat Washington as division
champs. Prediction -— 11-5.

Talk about coming out of no-
where. Super Bowl heroes Tim-
my Smith, Ricky Sanders and

a*'‘-‘;: '§;!7__:'¢'  "'.‘ie"' ~-
x-,.--e

Doug Williams were probably
the candidates least expected to
determine the outcome of last
year's Super Bowl, in which the
Washington Redskins romped
42-10 over the Denver Broncos.
This year, teams will be looking
out for them, as the element of
surprise is no more.

Doug Williams has beaten out
Jay Schroeder for the starting
quarterback job, but whether he
can hold it remains to be seen;
Williams hasn't been the epitome
of consistency during his 10-year
career.

The addition of mega-hitter
Wilbur Marshall to the lineback-
ing corps will strengthen the
weakest link on the team. But, as
it's been proven time and time
again, the Super Bowl hangover
is just too tough to get over in
only one season. Prediction -
1 1-5 ’

The newest hoopla team in the
league is the Philadelphia Eagles.
Everyone loves Randall Cunnin-
gham's running ability (505
yards) and his rifle arm. Keith
Byars and Anthony Toney are
great players in the backfield.
Coach Buddy Ryan is shaping up
one of the feistiest defenses in
football, with anchors Jerome
Brown and Reggie White on the
line. Look for the Eagles in the
playoffs, say the forecasters.

I don't buy it. And here's why.
There is nothing even interesting

about the Eagles linebackers, and V

the team's secondary is a sham.

sack Cunningham. Any team that
has its quarterback as its leading
rusher is asking for trouble. Phil-
ly is still two years away. Predic-
tion — 8-8.

A change of scenery might just
help the Phoenix Cardinals. Af-
ter all, Busch Stadium in St. Louis
is such a drab place, one that was
never full. The artificial turf made
it all the uglier. Quarterback Neil
Lomax, as well as runners Stump
Mitchell and Earl Ferrell, will
thrive on the grass field at Sun
Devil Stadium.

The Cards were one victory shy
of making the playoffs last sea-
son, as the Cowboys bumped
them off 21-16 on the last
weekend of play. Ken Harvey, a
rookie out of California, is the
third linebacker that the Cardinals
have taken in the first round over
the last four years. The other two,
Freddie Joe Nunn and Anthony
Bell, have lamed out.

Yes, a breath of fresh air will do
the Cardinals good, even though
it's a hot one. Prediction — 7-9.

A 54-10 preseason finale loss to
the Houston Oilers has Tom Lan-
dry and his Dallas Cowboys very,
very worried. By the final warm
up game, teams that are going to
be competitive should have their
sh— together, and Dallas certain-
ly doesn't qualify. Herschel
Walker is the lone superstar in
the Cowboys backfield, so defen-
sives will have one solitary body
to concentrate on. Rookie first-
round pick Mike Irvin would
have been unnecessary had last
year's top draftee Mike Sherrard
not broken his leg twice. Steve

stir:

Pelleur has won the QB job over
old-timer Danny White.

The Cowboys are ready to bot-
tom out. Prediction — 4-12.

0 THE NFC CENTRAL

All hail the new king! The Min-
nesota Vikings will be the new
champions of the navy blue and
white division. Tommy Kramer
won the preseason battle with
Wade Wilson, last year's playoff
hero, for the quarterback posi-
tion, but we haven't seen the last
of Wilson. The Vikes bolstered
their already formidable offensive
line by drafting a pair of guards
from Arizona State, Randall
McDaniel and Todd Kalis. The
defense is fiery. The only knock
on Minnesota is its inability to
score once inside the oppositon’s
10-yard line. And it killed them
in the final seconds of their 17-10
loss in the NFC Championship.

Everyone blamed Darrin Nel-
son for dropping the fourth-down
pass at the Washington goal-line,
but six points should have been
chalked up long before it came
down to that. Coach Jerry Burns
will make sure it won't come
down to a fourth down in 1988.
Prediction — 13-3.

Things are slowly starting to
come apart for the Chicago
Bears. First, the team's best
young linebacker, Wilbur Mar-
shall, to the free agent train to
Washington. Next, running back
Neil Anderson isn't becoming the
Walter Payton clone everyone
expected him to be. Speedster
wide receiver Willie Gault

demanded more moola and was
traded to the L.A. Raiders. The

only thing that can catapult the

if rookies Brad Muster (RB), Wen-
dell Davis (WR) and Dante Jones
(LB) make significant contribu-
tions. And then there is the ques-
tion oflim McMahon's health, or

What separates the Tampa Bay
Buccaneers from the cellar of the
division is a quarterback named
Vinny Testaverde. The second-
year pro out of Miami, Fla., has
the arm to put six wins on the
slate for coach Ray Perkins. Yet,
a consistent rushing attack —— the
Bucs drafted rusher Lars Tate of
Georgia to help there —~ and
some tough defense is what
separates Tampa Bay from a
potential wild—card spot. Rookie
offensive tackle Paul Gruber is
destined to become a great one.

1978. That should also tell you
something. Prediction — 5-11.

”Everything [films] we have is
from the old staff,” Gottfried said.
”Now everything we watch, from
what Coach Bruce is saying, they
are not doing any way. The films
we have are useful for looking at
personnel, but, again, they're not
doing any of the things they did
last year."

If the coaches are having a
tough time finding out what
Northern Iowa is about, it must
be a bigger load for the players.

”Being such a young team,
plus the fact that we haven't got
too much on Northern Iowa, the
whole game could give us trou-
ble,” free safety Troy Washington
said. ”Not getting too much film
on them will be a big factor. We
really don't know what to
expect.”

Bruce said that they will try a
five man front on defense and go
to a more pass—oriented team on
offense.

UNI will undoubtedly try to get
the ball to flanker Wes Anderson
(71 catches for 791 yards in '87)
or fullback Errol Peebles (191
rushes for 830 yards).

”The thing about those Divi-
sion 1-AA schools is that they
have great skill people,” line-
backer Jerry Olsavsky said. ”_You
have to control them. You give
them one good play and you

‘ never know what might happen.”

Pitt will start an entirely new
offensive backfield this season,
with quarterback Darnell Dicker-
son, halfback Adam Walker and
fullback Dan Crossman gaining
starting nods. Gottfried expects to

I shuffle players in and out during
the game so Larry Wanke, Ronald
Redmon and Ricky Turner should
see time behind a solid offensive
line.

The line is the strongest part of
the Pitt team and will be count-
ed onto hold off UNI, no matter
what the situation.

”Chances are they won't line
up against us in a base defense,”
offensive guard Mark Stepnoski
said. ”They’l| probably give us a
lot of different looks to try to get
the advantage on us mentally.
But, at this point, we are prepared
for anything."

On paper, this game should be
a Pitt romp. But UNI could put up
a fight, especially if they pull
some unexpected surprises.

Rogers of the Detroit Lions. The
team has gone with a youth
movement in cleaning out some
of the old veterans, and it still
stinks. Quarterback Chuck Long
has been pretty much a bust, as
has defensive end Reggie Rogers,
who recorded only six tackles in
all of 1987. Rookie defensive
back Bennie Blades will greatly
improve a weak secondary. Too
bad Blades can't play every other
position. Prediction — 4-12.

0 THE NFC WEST

The San Francisco 49ers have
now lost three consecutive
playoff games, despite having the
best record in football over that
span. The most shocking was last
season's 36-24 upset to the hands
of the Minnesota Vikings.

Owner Eddie DeBartalo is los-
ing his faith in his outfit and has
indicated that heads will un-
doubtedly roll if his team doesn't
reach the Super Bowl. Head
coach Bill Walsh, who directed
the team to a 13-2 record in '87,
has one of those pleasantries
known as -a quarterback con-
troversy, and the candidates are
the incumbent Joe Montana and
football's Dan Quayle, Steve
Young. Whoever is behind
center, the Niners are still an
offensive juggernaut.

On, defense, the team is in
desperate need of linebacking,
and recent attempts to acquire
New England's Andre Tippett and
Pittsburgh's Mike Merriweather
have failed.

The 49ers can be beaten this
year, but it'll take a strong team,
baby, or they'll show you the
door. Prediction — 12-4, have
faith.

Jim Mora, head coach of the
New Orleans Saints, has quickly
become the brightest new coach
in the game. He molded a peren-
nial loser into a 12-3 playoff con-
tender in two seasons, but he
contends that ”We may be a bet-
ter football team, than we were
last year, but we might not win
as many games."

To boost a ho—hum offense,
New Orleans drafted running
back Craig ”lronhead” Heyward
and WR Brent Perriman in the
first two rounds, respectively.
Quarterback Bobby Hebert had a
solid preseason, which eases the
minds of fans who watched him
self-destruct in the Saints’ 44-10
wild-card loss to Minnesota last
year. The ”Aints" ain't no moe.
Prediction — 11-5.

Hurricanes to blow by Seminoles in upset

Like 1987, a year which saw
Miami roll to the national title,
1988 could be a year in which a
team which is not considered a
traditional ”superpower” (also
known as Oklahoma, Alabama,
Ohio State) wins the national
championship.

Florida State, seemingly every-
body’s pick, could be the best in
the nation or maybe only second
best in the state. Iowa, with a tra-
dition not to be confused with
those of Ohio State and Michi-
gan, has a solid team and a light-
weight schedule — always a nice
combination. Ditto "for Clemson.

Of course, those are only three
of approximately 10 teams which
realistically have a shot at No. 1
this year. Penn State? No way.
Pitt? Better than Penn State, but
no —— wait until 1989. West Vir-
ginia? A very tentative maybe.

With all of this in mind and a
coin in hand, I will now attempt
to pick the winners and the
scores on this first full weekend
of college football, 1988.

Southern Cal — 23, Boston
College — 10

A win by the Eagles in this odd
matchup would go a long way
toward showing that ”Eastern
football” means more than just
Pitt, Penn State and more recent-
ly, Syracuse. Talking about the
lack of respect much of the nation
has for Eastern football is a tired
practice, but, unfortunately, a
valid one.

VINCE
LONGO

South Carolina — 34, North
Carolina —' 14

Six years ago, the score would
have been reversed. Remember
when LT and KB wore the Caro-
lina (sissified) blue?

Clemson -— 28, Virginia Tech
— 10

There's not even a chance that
Virginia Tech can win this game.

Illinois — 17, Washington
State — 14

The fact that this game is even
close shows the hard times that

the Illini have come upon.

Upset of the Week:

Miami — 29, Florida State —
10

Getting tired of Miami winning
all the time? Getting tired of see-
ing the Hurricanes playing for the
national championship every
January? Get used to it. Last year,
this game was the season's best,
with the Hurricanes coming from
behind for a thrilling one-point
victory. This time, the ‘Canes will
roll.

Syracuse — 20, Temple — 10

The Orange are better than
many people think, but they will

get off to a slow start against Tem- P

ple in this battle of teams which
Pitt just can't seem to beat.
Iowa — 35, Hawaii — 14
Hawkeyes coach Hayden Fry
once said that if the Big Ten is ac-
tually the Big Two and the Little
Eight, Iowa must be one of the
Big Two. This is true.
Pitt — 31, Northern Iowa — 0

down last year against Minneso-

quarterback on its opening day
roster is taking a totally absurd
risk. And that's exactly what the
Los Angeles Rams did recently,
waiving backups Hugh Millen
and Steve Dils, which left only
starter Jim Everett. They'd better
keep Everett healthy this year, be-
cause he's practically the only
offensive threat left on the team.

Running back Eric Dickerson
was traded to the Colts last sea-
son, and wide receiver Ron
Brown quit football outright.
Don't expect Charles White, who
led the league in rushing with
1,374 yards, to do anything
meritable like that again. Rookie
rusher Gaston Green is iniurv

 

prone and might be another Keith
Byars. Prediction —— 6-10.
What hath God wrought? Or
what hath He rot? The Atlanta
Falcons died eight years ago and
have been lying alongside the
road to the Super Bowl all that
time. 1980 was the last time At-
lanta was a quality football team,

the year they went 12-4 and cap-
tured the NFC West title. This
team should fight it out with
Detroit for the rights to being the
worst in professional football.
Linebacking rookies Aundray
Bruce and Marcus Cotton are a
secure step in the right direction,
though. Prediction — 4-12.

NFL drug policy lea ves a lot to be desired  

By Dave Goldberg

AP Sports Writer

The question arose on July 26,
when Pete Rozelle suspended
Dexter Manley for 30 preseason
days for violating the NFL’s
substance-abuse policy for a se-
cond time.

What's the penalty when all it
does is free Manley from two-a-
day workouts in 90—degree heat
and humidity?

We now know the answer.

For, just as Manley returns for
the Washington Redskins’ opener
against the New York Giants —
to the applause of his teammates
and Washingtonians who
cheered his early suspension -
the Giants’ Lawrence Taylor

B leaves for the first of four regular-

season games for essentially the
same infraction.

Which leads to a very basic
question. ‘

What good is the NFL’s drug
policy if there's uneven justice for
Lawrence Taylor and Dexter
Manley, two talented young men
both in need of help? What good
is the policy if a large part of the
nation's capital gets pleasure

from that uneven justice?

Taylor, who flaunted his late-
night lifestyle even after his first
voluntary commitment to treat-
ment, richly deserves to miss four
games and the $250,000 that
goes with the suspension. He also
seems in desperate need of treat-
ment that will cure his illness.

But what does it say to the
other sick players out there if
Manley and six others got train-
ing camp off — at a loss of $500
a week — for similar infractions?
Manley as much as said that he
believed it to be OK to fall off the
wagon as long as he did it in the
off—season.

The problem stems from two
sources:

1. The mandatory preseason
drug tests are staggered — some
teams test in July, some into mid-
August. Manley, Robb Riddick
and Greg Townsend got caught
early because the Redskins, Bills
and Raiders were in the first
group; Taylor got caught later be-
cause the Giants tested Aug. 15.

2. The NFL says the 30 days-
aren't punitive, they're re-

habilitative. J

To a point, that's true — Man-
ley, Taylor and the others must
undergo treatment and check in
regularly with the league's doc-
tors. And Taylor, who wrote in
his autobiography, ”the golf
course was my detox tank,” will,
in fact, undergo drug rehabilita-
tion, according to his agent, Gary
Kovach. ‘

Giants coach Bill Parcells, who
in 1982 took over a drug-ridden
team and not only solved most of
the problem but built a. Super
Bowl winner in the process, took
the league policyphilosophically.

”They can't do it at every time
for everybody,” he said. "Teams
report to training camps at differ-
ent times. They have their vete-
rans in at different times. The
league has a problem structuring
all those things.”

Perhaps.

But the NFL could make sure
that all penalties are created
equaHy.

It could test everyone over a
two—week period in July — either
just before camp or during it —

or announce nothing until just
before the start of the season,
then mete out the suspensions so

that Manley, Taylor, Riddick,

Townsend et. al. get four games
apiece.

The league argues that it
doesn't have the resources to do
the first and that it would be ab-
dicating its responsibilities if it did
the second.

”Suppose someone turned up
dead from an overdose while we
were waiting for all the tests and
we knew he had a problem?”
asks league spokesman Joe
Browne. ”Where would we be
then?”

Still, it's self—defeating to the
program when LaVern Torgeson,
Washington's defensive line
coach, rationalizes Manley’s sus-
pension with the fact that he'll be
back for the regular season. And
linebacker Monte Coleman
exults:

’’I’m very happy. I think 30
days is a blessing for him. You
know, I don't think we're really
hurting. We'll get Dexter back
soon.”

And where was the league in
January 1987, when the Denver
Broncos removed tight end Clar-
ence Kay from a drug rehabilita-
tion program for the playoffs,
then let him go back to rehab af-
ter the Super Bowl? The answer:
it was a first offense, so no sus-
pension is involved.

Perhaps, as John F. Kennedy
said when he called up the mili-
tary reserves in the 1961 Berlin
crisis, ”life is unfair.”

But when a suspension for drug
use elicits cheers, somebody
could try to make life just a little
more fair.

Do we need larger-than-life superstars?

By Jeff Sullivan
For The Pitt News

It seems to me that today's
music audiences are suffering
from the same disease as Ameri-
ca as a whole: there's a shortage
of superstars. »We as a society
have a voracious appetite for
bigger-than-life idols. No sooner
do we build one up than we are
tearing him or her back down
again (take Sean Penn as a case
in point).

The American Dream demands
heroes. The masses of average
people need to have someone to
whom they can point and say:
”Look, you can do anything if
you put your mind to it. Where
else but America can a nobody
like that (like me) grow up to be-

come a mil|ion—dollar—a—day star
(or CEO, or whatever)?” We need
that because the sad reality of the
situation is that the vast majority
of people are living average or
below-average lives. in fact, this
must be the case; if it weren't,

these heroes couldn't exist. Think ~

about it; if every household in
America made, say, $75,000 a
year (quite a comfortable in-
come), there wouldn't be enough
of the sweet stuff to pay Bruce
Willis $5 million for his latest
movie, or a studio head that
much in a week (it happens!).

Suffice it to say that we need
heroes in huge quantities. Why
huge quantities? Because we also
need to tear down these icons, to
topple them and see their pyrite
faces melt in the flames of the

peasants’ torches. As much as we
need to see that ”anyone can
make it,” we also need to see that
these giants are ”just like the rest
of us.” Hah! When was the last
time you had to take a $750,000
loss on your racehorse stock so
that you could make money on
taxes? But still, if we can see a
Sean Penn humbled by a rogue
reporter armed with a Nikon, or
if we can slam a Boy George to
the ground with tales of heroin
addiction, we feel better.

This, I think, is the reason why
the music scene today is the way
it is. We find one-hit wonders fill-
ing stadiums and fairgrounds that
the old monsters (some would
say dinosaurs) of rock ’n’ roll
would have filled only in their
heyday. Groups like The Who,

Detail of ”Boy Looking Through a Window, Dekalb Station. NY 1984.

the Beatles, Pink Floyd, Yes and
Led Zeppelin. Nowadays, we
have Johnny-come—latelies like
Richard Marx, The Jets, Cyndi
Lauper and Madonna filling such
venues after one or two hit al-
bums (or songs). It makes me
wonder what's going on.

Can we then blame the music
industry if it finally realized that
a group does not have to produce
a constant stream of strong-selling
albums to draw mammoth
crowds? Can we fault them for
noticing that a dollop of hyper-
bole, liberally spread across the
airwaves, and a hit single or two
can fill a stadium (and their pock-
ets) just as well? Well, maybe. I
sure do. I mean, if they weren't
so quick to make the big buck or
two, maybe we wouldn't have

this endless flow of one-shot mus-
ic crammed down our throats.
Then again, making money —
not art — is their raison d’etre.

Perhaps all we really have to
blame is ourselves. If we weren't
so needy of a new musical sen-
sation every week, then no mat-
ter how hard they pushed, the
industry couldn't feed it to us. But
we are needy, and they do feed
it to us.

We must realize that the even-
tual outcome of this pattern is the
fulfillment of Andy Warhol's
prediction. He claimed that, in
the future, everyone would be fa-
mous for 15 minutes. What we
have to ask ourselves is this: Is
that really genuine fame? is that
what we want? I don't think so.

Bond fan specializes in posthumous sequels

By Matt Wolf

Associated Press Writer

BLOXHAM, England —— John
Gardner is not just a thriller writer
but also a master of a very spe-
cial art: the posthumous sequel.

At his home in this English vil-
lage west of London, the 61-year-
old author writes James Bond
novels, having picked up where
007's creator, Ian Fleming, left off
when he died in 1964.

While American writer Alexan-
dra Ripley is just beginning a se-
quel to Margaret Mitchell's Gone
With the Wind, Gardner has al-
ready turned out seven Bond
novels, each a best seller in the
United States. The most recent,

Scorpius, is in its sixth consecu-
tive week on the New York Times
best-seller list.

’’It was a challenge, a little
honor,” Gardner recalled of his
decision to accept a publisher's
offer in 1979 to write a Bond
sequeL

He had already made a name
with his books about the adven-
turer Boysie Oakes and with such
cloak-and—dagger yarns as The
Dancing Dodo and The N05-
tradamus Traitor. He had also
written two novels featuring Sher-
lock Holmes’ nemesis, Professor
Moriarty.

So when Glidrose Publications,
Bond's literary copyright owners,
offered him a shot at 007 himself,

4-

he thought, ”Why not? If I don't
do it, somebody else will.”

Gardner was then living in_

lreland as a tax exile, and already
one Bond sequel, Colonel Sun,
had been published in 1968 by
author Kingsley Amis, writing un-
der the pseudonym Robert
Markham.

Gardner first encountered
Bond while in bed with the flu in
the early 1960s, when his wife,
Margaret, brought Casino Royale
and Dr. No from the library. ’’I
was absolutely enchanted,” he
recalled. A

”Fantasy, formula, fun are the
three F's of Bond writing,” he
said in an interview.

The exploits of the suave, self-

possessed hero, a man both
dressed and licensed to kill, de-
mand a lot from a writer, Gard-
ner said.

’’I sit down to do Bond and
with-in about four days, I'm cut-
ting lines out and making it run
very fast,” he said. ”Every chap-
ter I write I have to go back and
say, ‘No, you can take two lines
out there and you can say that in
three words.’ ”

’’It has to be that tight,” he said.
”These are books to be read in an
airplane or on a beach.”

His contract calls for two more
Bond novels. Under a separate
agreement, he is writing the book
of the forthcoming License Re-
voked, the first Bond movie not

drawn directly from a Fleming
book. -

Movies, Gardner said, pose the
greatest obstacle to sequel-
writing.

”People remember the movies
far better than the books,” he
said. "There's a universal myth
that Bond drove an Aston—Martin.
He didn't, except for a very short
time in Goldfinger. He drove a
very old Bentley."

Gardner's immediate future
looks relatively Bond-free. Secret
Families, the last in a trilogy
about espionage from 1910 to the
present day, will appear next
May.

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, September l, l988

According to all informed sources, the lovely
Lola Fee is still l\/llA. As a result, I've been called
on to fill in. l'll be bringing you these few lines
of rock trash and rumor in a (futile, l'm sure) at-
tempt to fill the Lola gap indefinitely.

Locally, there's a ton o' stuff to toss around.
Pittsburgh legends, The Five, will have vinyl on
Throbbing Lobsters records soon. The Five songs
"Take Me to Tommorrow" and "Open
Casket" will appear on a Throb Lobster compi-
lation. A full compilation record. of the Five's
career should be out in time for Christmas and
may only be released in Boston and Pittsburgh.

The Cynics will be embarking on a mini,
30-day tour of the East Coast next week, includ-
ing Boston and NYC.

Big local shows on the way feature the Pleas-
ureHeads and the Heretics at the Foundry on
the ioth, the Sponges-Spuds’ reunion at Graffiti
with 6 Gun Jury and Fusebox on the 23rd.

Among the big shows, the burning question
is whether to see the Ramones at the Mosque
Ballroom or Pere Ubu with John Cale at Graffiti
on the Ql st. Which Legend does one choose?

The Alternative Jam ll is a free (over 2l ) event
for Sept. lO at Graffiti. Thin White Line will
headline the festivities, which will feature four
additional bands.

Speaking of Thin White Line, hope you caught
vocalist Bob Porter's no-mike seronode of the
crowd at the PTS orientation thing last week.
Truly amazing (as were all the bands at the
nearly rained out gig)! _

Fusebox has written and performs Wl\/lYB's
"Rock in Pittsburgh" theme song, entitled

.. Introducing

"What's it Gonna Take?" The rumor says it will
be released as a 7" benefit for Children's
Hospital at Christmas.The Affordable Floors
may perform a Christmas song for the B-side.

Other cool shows to look for include Fourway-
cross with The Garden on the l lth, the
Scrawl/Happy Flowers show on the 24th, both
at the Foundry (which is the 'burgh's under-
ground lifesaver at this point, in light of last
winter's closing of the Squirrel Hill American
Legion to bands, and, of course, the demise of
the Decade).

Oh, don't forget the Young Fresh Fellows at
the l\/letropol tonight, possibly the strangest
combination of band and club ever.

Record label-wise, llAD has opened an
American office in NYC. The long—awaited Coc-
teau Twins LP will be released through Capitol
on Sept. l9. A&l\/l is releasing Stay Alva/<e, a
tribute to Disney, featuring classics performed by
the likes of Tom Waits, the Replacements, Sinead
O'Connor and those sensitive artists Mike Stipe
and Natale Merchant.

Also on the way are full length records from
Nick Cave, the ever—evil Diamanda Galas, Billy
Bragg, former Husker Du drummer Grant Hart
and a live Smiths recording.

The original Stray Cats have reformedll

Oh yeah, if you're wondering what's up at
lOO.7, a good guess is the format fooling will
be over by C’) p.m. tonight, and they'll become
"dance—track radio" or something like thct. |t's
supposedly different mixes of pop hits. Hmmmm.

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, September I, I988

From the Village to the ’Burg, meet Ashley

Please allow me to introduce
myself. My name is Ashley
Haight. The theatre is my life. I,
myself, am not an actress by trade
(though I'd like to be, if anyone
would care to throw a few parts
my way), but I am a student of the
craft itself. Of the art of drama.

I have studied the theatre in
some depth, from William
Shakespeare to Sam Shepard. I
am, in fact, a playwright. And a
critic. Which brings me to the
purpose of my visit.

I have come from Greenwhich
Village to begin writing a column
for Showcase. The column will
be featured on a semi-regular ba-
sis (either every week or every
other week, depending upon the
Pittsburgh theatre scene). And in
it I will review the plays staged
by the Pitt theatre, as well as

those presented by local theatre
companies.

I have not yet become fully
aquainted with the area theatre.

ASHLEY
HAIGHT

Things are so much different in
New york, you know. But I did
see a few of last year’s
productions.

I had the opportunity to see a
few rather impressive plays per-
formed by the Pitt Theatre depart-
ment last season, including The
Crucible, Baby, Educating Rita,
Spring Awakening and The Mis-
anthrope.

While viewing these produc-
tions, I gathered that there is a
great deal of talent at this univer-

sity. It seems to me that a few of
these young Pitt actors and ac-
tresses show tremendous
promise.

It would not surprise me at all
to see a few of these names in
lights in the years to come. Nona
Gerard. Harry Bouvy. C.T. Steele.
Anne Louise Bannon. Ken
Roberts. Keep an eye on these ac-
tors. They have professional
talent. _

And, of course, an exceptional
production is not possible unless
shaped by an exceptional direc-
tor. Anyldirector who can forge
a noteworthy production with the

limited resources of educational
theatre deserves a round of ap-
plause.

I once directed a play called
Lady Killers within an education-
al system. It was not what one
would call ”easy.”

That directing experience was
the point in my life at which I
realized my great love for the
theatre. Unfortunately, that love
proved greater than my acting (or
directing) talent. I decided then
that I would try my hand at writ-
ing and critiquing plays. So far
that aspect of the theatre has
granted me more success.

17

I am here now to review Pitts-
burgh theatre, which, I think, is
just beginning to come into its
own. University of Pittsburgh
theatre is an important part of that
(especially due to the Three
Rivers Shakespeare Festival).

Let's see how things shape up
after auditions for the coming
season.

(Information concerning
productions to be reviewed may
be sent to The Pitt News, care of
Ashley Haight.)
