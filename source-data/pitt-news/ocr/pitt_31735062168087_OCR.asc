ProblemsDiscusse(l   Pitt PI'()l)l€IIlS., I'()b6(i 

' _by KATHY McCANN
Staff Writer‘

A ten-member panel of trus-
tees, students, and housing per-
sonnel addressed an audience
of approximately 75 persons con-
cerning the problems of student
housing, on Monday in 121
Common Facilities.

John Vrana, Director of Uni-
versity Housing, introduced the
topic by identifying the frame-
work of the di-visions of student
housing. The divisions fall into
two categories: student affairs,
including resident hall programs

and student judiciary; and fin--

ances, which are mainly con-
cerned with maintaining dorm
rates at a reasonable level.

In enumerating the main pro-
blems in University housing,
Vrana stated the primary diffi-
culty is that demand exceeds
supply. He proposed three possi-

ble remedies: 1) build new fac-~

ilities, such as the Hillside Resi-

‘ dential Complex that .will be

ready for occupancy by Fall
term 1972-1973; 2) temporarily
lease housing similar to the pre-
sent arrangement of the Koch
for graduate stu-
dents; 3) stagnate further Uni-
versity plans and “let the mark-

‘ et bear”. ~

Vrana continued that’ the qual-
ity of off-campus housingis also
of vital importance in that its
high cost-low quality aspect af-
fects the one-third of the un-
dergraduate and 97 per cent of
the graduate student bodies that
it accommodates. Another con-
cern of the housing office lies’
in maintaining security and at
the same time permitting limited

‘access for‘ students to visit each ‘

other.
The development of recreation
and "leisure space for residents

‘poses a problem that ‘will be

considered at a proposed‘ meet-
ing to discuss plans for a new
Student Union, ' I

Vice Chancellor for Student.
Affairs, Bernard Kobosky’, open- '

 

Restructuring Commission - -
Proposes Constitution.

The eight member Student
Government Restructuring
Commission has proposed a
document for an association
of students to‘ replace the
present Student Government.

The proposed constitution
stresses student involvement
in the decision-making pro-
cess of the University, and
eliminates entirely the leg-
islative function of a repre-
sentative body.

, For ‘the "complete restruc-A

ktuiing  commussuo

. Ia

ed the forum to queries from the
audience. In answer to the ex-
pense of housing for married
graduate students, John Vrana
suggested either deductions
from invoice fees or stipends as
a solution. '

~ A moderator from the Schen-
ley quadrangle expressed a de-
sire for fire drills to test evacu-
ation procedure-bet'ore the term
is completed. In reply. Donovan
Hughes, Associate Director for
Business Affairs of, University
Housing and Student Affairs. ex-
plained that the Safety Com-
mittee is in the process of sett-
ing up a new procedure and that

a drill is scheduled prior to Eas- «

ter break. _

The procedure for the recent
selection of resident assistants
was questioned, and in response,
Donna K. Smith, Associate Dir-
ector for Personnel of University
Housing and Student Affairs. re-
plied that there was “very little
change of the old procedure”.
John Vrana stated that'only 45
positions were available to the
450 applicants, and though the

_opportunity must be "a mean-

ingful experience, we realized
that we’d have to be quite sel-
ective.”

Vrana predicted that there
would be no undergraduates

John Vrana, Director of Stu-‘

year. In that year. he has faced
many problems, and has been in-
strumental in many changes.
Vrana talked to the'Pitt News on
some of these problems and

for the University of Pittsburgh,
which‘ is understandable _ since
he attended Pitt as an under-

 

 

graduate. graduate. and is now
working toward his doctorate
here. He takes his responsibili-
ties seriously; but. at the same
time, maintains a very open
channel of communications with
students.

Vrana joined the University
staff'in 1965 as Assistant to
the Vice-Chancellor of Student
Affairs. He has also served‘as
Director of Student Affairs Plan-
ning. He observed, ‘*1 learn

It was during his first few
months as Director that Saga

by BOB GING
‘ News Editor
(Editors note — In an effort to

be fair to all sides. the Pitt News
is attemptingto present the two
sides of the dispute between Lo-
cal'1199, Local 29.'The dispute
is centered around who should

represent workers in various
parts of the University. ) _
' Local 29’

On January 6, 1970, B. Mere-
dith Reid, a labor arbitrator.
handed down the ruling that
Local 29iof the Building Serv-
ice Employees Union has had
jurisdiction over workers at the
University’s Nurses Residence
since Sept. 1. and that they are
entitled to union pay. and fringe
benefits retroactive to that date.

The decision was a result of a
grievance file by Local 29.

which claimed that since Sep-’

tember 1,1969, the population
of the Nurses Residence was
composed of more than 50 per-
cent Pitt students. The union
maintained that this gave them
,the. right to represent these em-

Local 1199P attempted to
block the arbitration by seeking
a temporary injunction, but
Common Pleas Court Judge J.
Frank “McKenna refused to
grant _it. Local 1199P refused
an invitation to offer testimony
at the arbitration proceedings,
although ‘one member of that

— union did attend the hearing.

Employees who fall under Lo-
cal 29’s jurisdiction will receive
many benefits, including salary

were paid, since by being in the

Presently a Local 1199P is»
in disagreement with the deci-
sion by the arbitrator concern-"

contesting the fact that the Uni-

right to. represent workers in

peachment of an election stu-

2. The impeachment case will

bers of the University judiciary.

’ After extensively reviewing the
present student, government’s
form and function, "the Restruc-
turing Commission proposes the
following document with the
purpose of providing for the
most effective association of

. students.

.During the past -two years,
student government has been

the object of much pointed cri- ‘

ticism. the bulk ofthis directed
at the body’s
its

meaninglessness, and its

failure to represent students due

to the "pathetic voter turnouts
it experiences. Apathy has-been
the charge. most often directed
against the student body for this
state of affairs; but this is much
too simple an answer.

At present, student govern-
ment is a very highly specializ-
ed activity that in its function-
ing that not allow more than a
very few students to- relate to
it. Those activities of student
government that do affect the
entire student body, seats on
faculty councils and committees,
and social affairs, are presented
in the form of a finished pro-
duct. Students are far removed

‘from the process of how/ these
» decisions and events are turned

out, and consequently have no

experience - with which . to relate

to-‘a “student government election,

..To assume that a "centralized
student government can in any
sense represent, and on a dif-

'ferent ‘level; govern, a__ signifi-

cant number . of students is,

(Continued from Par/e 2)

we feel, both unattainable and
more importantly, undesirable.
Given the wide range of student
experiences and needs, a cen-
tralized body, and more, a legis-
lative body, is out of place at a
university.

Yet an association of students
has important functions to ful-
fill within certain areas of the
student community. And we be-
lieve that the criticisms of stu-
dent government outlined above
can be answered in certain
aspects. We feel that an associa-
tion of students has two prim-
ary fumctions: 1—To establish a
mechanism by which students
participate in the decision-mak-
ing process of the university
community, and; 2-To allocate
the monies that are collected
from students as democratically
as possible and to effectively co-
ordinate activities programming
of university-wide events. Sec-
ondary to these are the services
that such an association can fa-
cilitate.

The question of representative-
ness can best be answered that

mittees and faculty councils in
each of the schools. be directly
elected by their respective con-
stituencies and, in the case of
committees. students be ap-
pointed specifically for that pur-
pose by those who are directly
elected. This should be the ex-
tent of “student representative."

By directly electing the stu-
dent members of the University
Senate Council and by having
them appoint the committee
members; and by directly elect-
ing the academic representatives
to the Undergraduate Council by
school and having each appoint
committee members correspond-
ing to seats available in that
school, the question of repre-
sentativeness and participation
in decision-making is as ade-
quately answered as possible.

In the area of social activities
programming and distribution of
monies for such, we feel that a
much greater degree of coordin-
ation and effectiveness can be
achieved. A Social Council, con-
sisting of those students who

are directly responsible to a con-
stituency based on either a resi-
dence or academic dimension.
and those organizations with tra-
ditional social programming func-
tions, can serve as the most re-
sponsible coordinating body in
the area of social affairs.

Since a large allocation is
granted specifically for activi-
ties in the Student Union, and
since this grant must be held in
a separate account owing to its
university community, not solely
student, nature, we have includ-
ed on the Council represen-
tatives from the administration
and faculty. These two represen-
tatives will not be involved in
the approval of solely student
monies.

We have designated this body,
the one we feel combines the
greatest degree of representa-
tiveness and awareness, as the
one to approve the budget sub-
mitted to it by the Allocations
Committee. This body will not
determine program content, nor
will it in any way interfere with
the activities of organizations
except where these are of a uni-
versity-wide nature. Its respon-

sibility will be to effectively
coordinate the programming of
social activities of university-
wide nature throughout the cam-
pus.

We have effected a reorgani-
zation of existing service com-
mittees under student govern-
ment and created two new ones
to initiate endeavor in the areas
of student-oriented research to
ascertain opinion on the func-
tioning of the student associa-
tion and to work with the Office
of Program Planning and Public
Affairs to move into the areas of
trustee relationships, alumni
relationships, and a cordial re-
lationship with the State Legis-
lature.

In the amending procedure we
have sought to keep the struc-
ture as flexible and responsive
to change as possible.

In the long run, what we feel
must be changed is that Student
Government should no longer
be an activity-its responsibili-
ties are too important for that.
We realize the inherent limita-
tions in structural revision and
that structure is often only a sin-
gle variable in a complex whole.

But we feel that an association
of students based on the follow-
ing document can function effec-
tively and serve a very real and
important purpose.

A referendum of the student
body is the only means by which
such a change can be brought
about. As such, comments and
criticisms are absolutely essen-
tial. Each of the members of the
Restructuring Commission can
be reached for discussion and
we hope that discussion can be
carried on through the Pitt
News and WPGH. We feel that
such a change is an extremely
important step towards a con-
ception of a university commun-
ity and that it has been extreme-
ly rewarding for us to have play-
ed a role in its inception.

University of Chicago
Students Get No Say

  In Academic Decisions

(Editors Note: The following are excerpts from an article
that appeared in The Washington Post earlier this month, by
_. Rowland Evans and Robert Novak concerning the University
'_ of Chicago and its relationship with its students. The head-
I ” line of the article was, ( (Chicago Campus Is Like a Para-
, ,-dise, With_Confident, No-Nonsense Faculty.”
1 I CHICAGO — At one of his regular breakfast conversa-
tions with students recently, president Edward H. Levi of the
University of Chicago listened to a law student’s vigorous de-
mand that students be given a voice in determining tenure
" for professors —— that is, who shall have permanent faculty
status . . . . . . . . . . . . .
jg . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Levi’s reply was calm but firm . . . .
In brief the faculty.will continue to judge itself without help
from students.

..That single encounter between president and student
=-..jhelps explain why Chicago, with a traditionally radical stu-
dent body and surrounded by Chicago’s black slums has so
far escaped the worst of the campus insurrection.

. . . . . . . . . The basic reason is that the men who “run
the University of Chicago have decided that the business of
1 higher education is much too’ important to be entrusted to
 post-adolescents. Although Levi breakfasts regularly with stu-
dents and has formed student-faculty committees, he is dub-
ious about the value of student participation. In three years as
president, the former law professor has, made it clear that stu-
dents will not make academic decisions.

. . . . . . Compared to often outrageous classroom intimi-
dation practiced by student radicals across the country, . . . .
. the cool Chicago campus is paradise. Indeed there have been
 recent signs that the students here are turning away from
 attempts to take over the university and concentrating on
whatever national issue is in the headlines —- Vietnam, the
environment, ABM or, most recently, the Chicago conspiracy

trial. '
....This is not because the students are particularly unusual.
Faculty members confided to us that Chicago students, pro-
bably brighter and more alert than their predecessors, dislike
contemplationand vastly prefer bull sessions to study. Had
they been granted the concessions of the Santa Barbara or
MIT students, they might now be rampaging here on the
I 'midway. ‘ '
..The secret of Chicago seems to lie in the fact that the
faculty of and Levi (deeply admired by faculty, though not
by students) believe in themselves, unlike many educators
 across the country. With distinguished academicians ranging
T, from political scientist Henry Morgenthau on the left to eco-

nomist Milton Friedman on the right the Chicago faculty be-
lieves it has an invaluable product that should not be dena-
" tured by student whims. '

, ‘In an era of "rampant student-worship on the nations cam-
 puses, teachers and administrators here are unique in -one vi-
tal respect. Unlike almost every college we have visited late-
 ly, nobody here told us: “You have to listen to -the stndents;
' they have something to say.” Such academic self confidence
~may be the starting point for the preservation of the univer-
5’ sity.

Science. Vs. Religion

Or Can They Combine?

(Editor's Note: This section
is a reprint form Intelligent Life
in the Universe, a co-effort by
Russian I.S. Shklovskii and Am-
erican Carl Sagan. l

As science has progressed dur-
ing the last few centuries. areas
which were originally the ex-
clusive province of religion have
been increasingly prempted by
science. We no longer hold that
the Earth is stationary, or what
it is at the center of the uni-
verse: nor that the world was
made even approximately on Oc-
tober 23. 4004 B.C.: nor that it
was made in seven days; nor
that different species had separ-
ate creations; nor that the ori-
gin of the solar system and the"
origin of life are forever be-
yond the ken of man.

Rather. the laboratory synthe-
sis_ of life from materials which
were abundant in the early en-
vironment of the Earth seems no
more than a decade off.

One result of these encroach- '

ments by science has been that
there seems less and less for God
to do. If he creates some hydro-
gen at the beginning of the uni-
verse. and establishes the phy-
sical laws. he can then retire.

He is roi faineant. If God did
not directly make life or man.
it is. hard to believe that he will
intervene in our everyday lives.
or answer our supplications.

Yet the temptation to believe
in an Omnipotent. omniscient.

and loving God is especially
great today. The pace of world
events is out of the hands of
the ordinary individual.

Our destiny appears to be at
the mercy of forces we little un-
derstand and only perilously
control. If only there existed a
god who was concerned. with
our plight. who would give some
assurance of our survival; but
who was explicable within‘ the
framework of contemporary sci-
ence . . . .

The saucer myths represent
a neat compromise between the
need to believe in a traditional
paternal God and the contem-
porary pressures .to'accept the
pronouncements of science.

Another Jab
At Tiernan’s
Free /Speech

Former Editor, The Pitt News;
Dear David Tiernan;

Freedom of Speech needs no
definition. The term is self de-
fining and therefore discussion
or elaboration of it’s limitations
and responsibilities is meaning-
less. For this reason-I enjoyed
your editorial of March 4.

Certainly it is apparent that
you are a concerned individual.
Concerned about people looking
at you and thinking that you may
be a bit_ touched, concerned
about “husband-seekers”, “plas-
tic” hippies and of all people
your concerned about Mrs. John
Mitchell, Peggy Lee and John

Wayne,’

I to amconcerned about your
total lack of respect for individ-
ual’s rights. Quite a few indi-
viduals enjoy marriage, children,
pursuing the work of their
choice and even, the National
Football League.

I’m not defending these insti-
tutions, values or what they rep-
resent, merely the fact that peo-
the same
right to pursue or enjoy the
above or for that r‘natter what-

_ ever they please just as you en-

joy the right to write and criti-
cize what you please, resist the

draft or judge those_with “sec-

ond class” educations.

This last point leads me -to
your statement referring to the
decline of universities that ac-
comodate local students with
“second rate” educations.

What may I ask constitutes
a “second rate” education‘? Who

‘ would set the standards? Are

you referringto children educat-
ed in ghetto situated schools?
Or do only those who have_
“first rate” educations and the

assumption is that you are one '

of the chosen few, deserve a col-
lege level education‘?

- the
_tion Journal".

Finally I would like to suggest
two alternatives to your state-

ment dealing with “shitting or

getting off the pot" and the in-
ference in your editorial suggests
that you may still be shitting.

First of allyou might migrate
to Cuba and enlist as a sugar
cane cutter for this years harv-
est. During your spare time you’
could write political articles for
“Havana People’s Libera-

And when you tire of the cen-
sor’s scissors and begin to cry

-who knows. we may feel sorry

for you and send John Wayne
and the Marines to the rescue.
The second suggestion is quite
simple—getfucked. ‘

Results From  
‘Management’

Mr. Chuck Goodman
Public Relations >
Presbyterian University Hospital
Dear Sir:

-As a graduate student in the
Department of Psychology may
I take exception to you com-
ments on Local 1199, The Pitt
News, March 11 efforts to or-
ganize to the hospital workers
(and soon the University work-
ers).

' ..First of all, we hardly view

any union, much less the Local»
1199 as the establishment. It is

true that some unions, particu-

larly in industry have taken es-
tablishment like racialattitudes

v in the past. _

However, if you look closely
you will find this is often the
result of management adjusting
its racial problems with solu-
tions that penalize the worker
thus forcing him to_ ally with
management. Follow for instance
the history. of integration of
work forces not by a company
taking any loss from its profits

Ifow Our Readers See

but by directly, with much fan-
fare, laying off white workers.

Second, I would hardly call
the wife of the winner of the
Nobel Peace Prize, or his form-
er assistant a “militant racist”. I
hold that Mrs. Coretta King and
Rev. Ralph Abernathy can be

invited anywhere as sincere
servants of humanity of any
color.

Third, I agree with -your sug-
gestion that there. should be a
better way to protect employes
than a union. But in the absence
of any governmental protection
and the absence‘ of any employ-

" er e_fforts,‘unions have a history

of being the only way a worker
can improve his lot.
If this is not the case then

how else can you explain the ,

differences in salaries and bene-
fits obtained by working. men
in comparable levels of employ-
ment in union versus nonunion
shops?

Forgive the haste of this mes-
sage, and since I understand
your ~ job is not to formulate
hospital policy but ‘to interpret
it to others please help carry
the message bothways by re-
laying this response to your
statements to hospital authori-

, ties. Thank you for your atten-

tion. _

Medically Speaking, Just What Is An Abortion?

by BONNIE WOLINSKY
Special to The Pitt News

While the socio—legal aspects

f _,of abortion are extremely impor-
I ‘ ,tant, we must also be made aware
. of the medical aspects of the
. ’ problem. By clearing up some of_
' the common misconceptions about
abortions, it is hoped that they
will be able to approach this
‘problem in a more informed way.

An attempt has been made to
answer some of the most impor-
tant medical questions which

'_ many have asked:

‘Q. What is abortion?

I A. .Medically speaking, it is
the expulsion of the fetus be-
fore‘ it is viable. If this occurs
during the first three months of
_. pregnancy, it is called abortion;
' from this time until about the
20th week it is called induced
. miscarriage, and from the 20th
‘ . week to nine months, premature
delivery.

The therapeutic abortion is
’ simply one which is medically
‘justified, and may or may not
‘be legal. In the eyes of most
physicians, if a woman has had
. .:_ German measles during the first
». ‘ three months of pregnancy (the
 mprime cause of fetal deformity)
 or if there are other reasons to
; I suspect fetal deformity, or if
' her mental or physical health
will be endangered by the com-
pletion of the pregnancy, medi-
cal justification for the abortion
exists.

 

 

\

 

. l Obviously, each individual
physician must make his own
medical assessment, because

“mental or physical health” is
‘such a vague phrase covering a
' , broad area.

Q. How would a safe abortion
be performed?

" A. It would be performed in a
hospital by a qualified physi-
cian, only after the patient’s
, pregnancy has been confirmed
’ by apelvic examination.‘ .
, : While it takes about two weeks
 . for .signs of pregnancy to appear,
’ ‘ thepregnancy is rarely confirm-
ved before five or six weeks. (Wo-
men often rely on pregnancy
tests utilizing urine specimens,
and then try to seek abortions
if the results are positive. How-
ever, tests of this nature have
been known to yield both false
positives and false negatives.
" Thus, "one finds many illegal
abortions being attempted on
women who are in fact not preg-
nant atall,)

‘Once the pregnancy has been
confirmed, the practitioner will
 most likely perform a standard
' ' dilatation and curettage (“D and
C”) iflthe pregnancy has not

gone beyond the third month.

With this method, entering
j through the vagina, the doctor
will first insert a series of metal
dilatators (cone-like instruments)
of increasing size into the mouth
of the womb, thus stretching the
. cervix.

 

 

    
  
 
   
  
  
  
  
  
   
  
   
  
  
  
  
 
  
  
   
   
      
   
  
    
   

 , When the cervix is sufficiently
j_di1ated, the doctor inserts the
5’-curette, a tiny scop shaped in-
strument which is used to scrape
the walls of the uterus and re-
move the embryo. The patient
- would usually be placed under a
-general anesthesia, i.e., sodium
pentathol, during the entire op-
eration.

_ Q. How safe is a “D and C”?

operation performed by the gyne-
cologist, a “D and C” done dur-
ing the early months of the preg-

l

 

 Being the most common.

i fetus. However, with this meth-

 

nancy by a competent physician,
is safer than a tonsillectomy and
is also safer than carrying the
pregnancy to full term.

Q. ARE THERE ANY “PILLS”
WHICH THE PHYSICIAN
MIGHT PRESCRIBE TO IN-
DUCE ABORTION, AS AN AL-
TERNATIVE TO SURGERY?

A. Many physicians have been
doing research on the “morning
after pill.” A drug, '.‘F-6103,”
has been tested for the purpose
of abortion, in Sweden, and is
said to be effective as much as
two months after conception.
“F-6103” is believed to work
by interrupting the normal hor-
monal cycle of early pregnancy,

thus causing the embryo to be
expelled. -

Also being developed arepills
which operate like the female

hormone, estrogen. Taken after

intercourse. such pills act by
preventing the fertilized ovum
from being implanted in the ut-
erus.

However, such "pills" are only
in the developmental stages and
have not yet been perfected. thus
preventing their usage on any
large scale.

Q. IF THE PREGNANCY HAS

ADVANCED TO A STAGE
WHERE A “D AND C” IS NO

LONGER PERMISSIBLE,
WHAT O T H E R METHOD
MIGHT BE USED?

A. One such method would be
to inject a glucose or salt solu-
tion into the amniotic sac, thus
inducing artificial labor con-
tractions which would expel the

 

. fiber catheter.

   

od, infection and other compli-.

cations can develop, even when
this is done therapeutically.

In extreme cases, a hysterec-
tomy (surgical removal of the
uterus) could be performed, but

this would be a drastic measure,’

because the woman could no
longer bear children.

Q. WHAT ARE SOME OF THE
METHODS MORE LIKELY TO
BE USED BY THE SELF-ABOR-
TIONIST OR BY THE ABOR-
TIONIST WHO IS NOT A PHY-
SICIAN?

A. Foreign Bodies.

The foreign objects may be in-
serted by a friend or relative,
introduced by an abortionist. or

The fetus in metamorphosis.

even self-inserted. The abortion
induced by a foreign body is
thought to work by rupturing the
fetal membranes and stimulating,
uterine contraction (labor).

The most frequently used for-
eign body is the soft rubber ure-
thral catheter or the more rigid,
These catheters
can be purchased in most drug-
stores. without prescription. A
metal stylet is often used to pro-
vide rigi_dity for easier insertion
through the uterus.

An opened wire coat hanger
is often used to form the stylet.
In most cases. the catheter has
not been sterilized. and the wom-
an IS told to await the onset of
bleeding and then to seek hospi-
talization.

Many other foreign bodies have
been used by the self-abortionist, _
i.e., curtain rods. wires, um-
brella ribs. and knitting needles.

   

 

The main dangers associated
with abortions induced by for-
eign bodies are severe infection
and perforation of the uterus.

B. Douches.

Women often attempt to induce
abortions by the use of high pres-
sure douches with a solution con-
taining various chemicals, i.e.,
soap solutions (most lethal and
most common’), turpentine, pine
oil, Lysol, hydrogen peroxide,
and water.

..The prime risk involved with

this method is peritonitis, which
could lead to death. The success
rate in inducing, abortion by
douching is quite low.

Q. ARE ORAL ‘AGENTS, I.E.,
ERGOT, OR QUININE, EFFEC-

TIVE ‘AS ABORTIFACIENTS?

A. The. oral agents are probab-
ly_the least effective of the a-bor-
tificients frequently employed.
Ergot preparations are readily
obtained at drugstores, and are
often usedby women trying to
induce abortions.

However, unless the dosage
taken approaches toxic levels, er-
got IS usually ineffective as an
abortifacient.

Large doses’ of ergot taken at
a more advanced Stage of the
pregnancy could have the disas-
trous effect of uterine rupture.

As in the case of ergot, qui-
nine, strychnine, caster oil, rose-
mary, cloves, thyme, saffron, and
phosphorus, and sassafras are also
ineffective as abortifacients. un-
less ‘taken in dosages which would
endanger one’s life.

 

In closing, one can say that
illegal abortions which are either
self-induced or are induced by
abortionists who are not quali-
fied physicians, are extremely

risky, often lead to death, and‘

are often attempted on women
who are not even pregnant.

On the other hand, abortions
done during the first three
months of pregnancy, by compe-
tent physicians with adequate fa-
cilities, involve very little risk.

Church View
Ten Years

  Penitance

(Editor's Note: This discus-
sion of the position of the Cath-
olic Church on the abortion

question is reprinted from the

October 13, 1967 edition of The

Association for the Study of Ab-
ortion,Inc.

Despite the safeness, abortion
is an emotion packed equation:
a maternal life saved equals a
fetal life destroyed. Out of
deep concern for the fetus as
well as tribal survival -— men dis-
approved of abortion even be-

_. fore the Hippocratic oath.

The very first Christians called
it infalnticide; in AD 314, the
Church prescribed ten years pen-

itance for it. There after theolo- '

gians debated the point at which
the fetus is “animated” with a
rational soul and hence murder-
able.

By the twelfth century, abortion
was generally not punished by
excommunication when perform-
ed within 40 days of conception
for a male fetus and 80 days for
a female fetus, though it was
impossible then (as it is difficult
now) to fix the time of concep-
tion and ‘no one‘ ever explained
how the fetal'sex could be pre-
determined. .

Pope Sixtus'V (1585-90) made
abortion an excommunicatory
sin at any stage of development,
but this order was reversed the
year after his death by Gregory
XIV who approved excommunica-
tion only after the fetus was 40
days old.

In 1869, Pius IX reverted the
Roman Catholic Church to the
Sixtus position which holds that
ensoulment begins at concep-
tion. A

Modern Catholic clerics in-
creasingly rely on embriology
rather than ensoulment to -urge
that a newly fertilized -ovum is

virtuallya person because it con- A

tains all the ce_ll-creating chromo-
somes that a human has.

As they see it, the conceptus is
a living continuum from the
start, a life that dies only from
outside interference. In 1930, Plus
_XI made it clear that abortion is
forbidden even to save a ‘wom-

an’s life, because the fetus is "

tains substantially the same provisions except as
to the penalty which was formerly a fine not exceed-

ing $500 “and” imprisonment not exceeding.‘ three ,

years instead of a fine “or” imprisonment.

CONSTRUCTION AND APPLICATION
This section does not make actual abortion a
crime, but instead sets forth.the acts which consti-
tute an attempt to produce an abortion and makes
this mere attempt the crime.

NATURE AND ELEMENTS OF OFFENSE

It makes no difference under this section though
the substance administered or action advised not
only fails to produce the effect but has no tendency
to produce it or whether the woman was or was not
pregnant.

, Under this section, it is unnecessary thatan ac-
tual abortion occur nor isit necessary that the wom-
an actually be pregnant, so long as the defendant be-
lieved her to be and that the instruments used, drugs
administered or other means used were believed to
be sufficientto perform an abortion.

In prosecution for abortion, the court properly
charged that if it was feared that the woman involv-
ed may have become pregnant as a result of illicit
connection and an instrument was used or a drug ad-

. ministered with intent to procure -her miscarriage
if she were pregnant, then defendant could be found
guilty although the woman may not have been ac-
tually pregnant. ’

While words “abortion” and “miscarriage” are
synonymous according to the dictionary, common
usage has given the word “abortion” when used
with respect to human beings, the meaning of crim-
inal miscarriage as against natural miscarriage.

An abortion need;not be alleged or proven to con-
vict the physician of violating this section defining

offenses of administering drugs and using instru-
ments with intent to procure a woman’s miscarri-
age, though section bears heading “abortion” as
heading is not part of section.

The law does not require an actual abortion or
miscarriage for conviction.

(Editor's Note No. 2: The following information,
governing the justification and procedures for thera-
peutic abortions in Pennsylvania is taken from The
Hospital Law Manual, Health Law Center, University
of Pittsburgh, 1956.)

ABORTION: DEFINITION

Abortion——the expulsion of the product of concep-
tion before child is vianle. When this occurs during
the first three months, it is termed abortion; from

this timeto viability, immature delivery or miscar— _

riage and from the period of viability to fullterm,
premature delivery.

ABORTION, SECTION III‘

The recent statutes that specify the grounds for
a medical termination of a pregnancy usually re-
quire that the abortion be performed by a physician
licensed to practice medicine in the state in a li-
censed hospital with the :approval of a committee
of physicians. ‘

In order to avoid an influx of abortion cases from .

other states, several states have limited justified
abortions to women who have met a residency re-
quirement. ’ ’

Some statutes stating that ground for abortion

specify that the procedure must be done withina -

stated period of time after the inception of the,preg—
nancy. ~ ” ' ' ' '

The existence of therapeutic necessity is a mat} :

ter of medical judgment. The American Medical As-‘

sociation policy regarding abortion urges that con-

sultation be obtained from two other physicians and
that such operations take place only in accredited
hospitals.

HOSPITAL.LAW MANUAL, VOLUME II,
CONCENSE3 .
Under the applicable statutory provision, an

_ abortion is a crime if it is performed willfully or _-
unlawfully. The statute does not define these terms‘
nor have the Pennsylvaniacourts. It isassurned that. l
in view of the general recognition of an exception P
for the preservation of the woman’s life, an abortion . '

for such a purpose would be legal.

_ EXCEPTIONS
A womanncannot be properly convicted for com-
mitting this crime upon herself. '

 

 Abortion Relief, Not Regret  

More than ‘ 5,000 qualified’ and ,
registered psychiatrists support
liberal reform of the current laws
regulating abortions.

 According to The American
”Journal of Psychiatry, October,

1967, a poll taken of 13,000 psy-
chiatrists to which 40 per cent re-
sponded, produced an overwhelm-
ing reaction discrediting the myth
that women are psychologically
damaged by the experience of
abortion.

Seven questions were posed to
the respondents, 95 per cent of
whom signed their answers. The
results of the pollingindicated
that:

-95 per cent favored abortion
when the life of the mother is
endangered; ’

--86 -per cent in the caseof pos-
sible impairment of life;

'1 -88 per cent opted for abortions
when the mother. may suffer
mental or emotional‘ complica-
tions; .

.—90 per cent when the child may
be damaged; ‘

'-92 per cent favored abortion in
the case when the pregnancy is
the result of rape or incest for
a child under 16;

-86 per cent, in the. same situa-
tion when the girl is over 16;

‘-23.5 per cent supported abortion-
upon the requestof the mother.

  

formed the basis for the objec- ,
tions to the present-abortion reg-.

ulations.

While a number of the respon-
dents preferred improvement in

the methods of contraception and

more widespread sterilization
procedures,’ the majority of those
who answered the questionnaire
put more stock in the “human
wastage” and "the
emotional responses" of the moth-
ers.’-’

“A pregnancy -should be ter-
minated whenever.a woman is
desperate enough to seek it. no
matter what the "reasons. Too
many "women havefdied because
moral clergymen and members
of the mercenary underworld have
driven them into hands of unskill-

ed individuals.’-’ a "woman psy-'

chiatrist wrote in the. issue of The
American Journal of ‘Psychiatry.

_Dr. Rose Middleman, professor»
of Population Development at the
University and staff member of
Planned Parenthood, claimed that
“in effect, the psychological ef-
fect upon the woman undergoing
abortion is nearly all good. Most
women feel relief rather than re-
gret." -

"Many psychiatrists go out of ’

their way to help a woman out.”
she continued. Dr. Middleman ci-
ted the example of a psychiatrist
friend of hers who.-in 20 years of

V practice; had onlyseen one woman
 with , psychological» complications
,ifrom,ab'ortion.- : -

 

individual .

This case. she explained, oc-
curred when the girl was forced
into seeking a abortion by family
pressure.

According to Dr. Middleman,
the risk of death in an abortion
performed therapeutically is ex-
tremely low, statistically about
four per million, a figure lower
than the deaths resulting from
normal pregnancy. which reach-
es 250 per million.
Illegal abortions. on the other

. hand, claim 1,000 women for ev-

ery one million who seek them.

The Irony: llll Abortions Illegal, Except When Self-Induced

As Safe As Tonsillectomyi

. “There are no conditions under
which an abortion is legal in the
state . of Pennsylvania," claimed
Mrs. Patricia Miller, vice-chair-
man and co-founder of the Abor-
tion Justice Association of Pitts-
burgh.

A defendant “only needs proof

of intent against him,” she contin-

ued, '-’the law here is the most
vague in_the country.” She ex-
plained that legal, ie, therapeutic‘
abortions, can only be performed
on the assumption that there is a
lawful method of abortion in Penn-
sylvania.

 

. 

THE ‘WAY’

The procedure for acquiring a
legal abortion in Pennsylvania re-
quires that the recipient be over
21 or have the consent of parents.

- The woman in question must con-

tact a doctor affiliated with a hos-
pital that permits therapeutic
abortions to be performed.

The next step is to procure the
written affidavits of two psychi-
atrists who will. declare her for
any number of reasons “psycho-
logically, mentally, and emotion-
ally unfit to bear and raise the
child.” If she can obtain these ref-
erences, her case is considered by
a review board at the hospital.

Her application for the abortion
must include a letter from herself
stating the reasoning behind her
request and a recommendation

_ from her physician.

If she is accepted, the abortion
procedure can be performed in
two days with overall fees ranging
from $400 to $600 (including doc-
tor’s, psychiatrists‘ and hospital
fees). , - .
If she is refused. she must find
another doctor, another hospital
and another set of psychiatrists
(or pay for another set of recom-

Supplement Editor: Virginia Joyce;-, 

 

mendations). All of this must be .
done within three months, since‘ ”
hospital will not administer an‘

abortion after that time.

Mrs. Miller provided figures. 

that indicate that approximately

800 therapeutic abortions were-“El
performed in the last two years in * I

Allegheny County; the estimated
ratio of illegal to legal abortion
performed is 100 to one. ‘

‘THE ASSOCIATION
The Abortion Justice Associa-
tion (AJA) works on a four point-
plan:

-,—to educate the public by dispens-I

ing literature arranging speak-
ing engagements, etc.

—to affect the opinions of people
concerning the abortion issue.

—to refer women to competent 
physicians for medical he'lp'jf ‘_‘«,-of

. ‘they find themselves pregnant.

--to “do something” about the 
Pennsylvania laws that restrict «

abortions.

The group is composed of all—_,_?.—
types ofpeople, including Catho—  1;;
lics who, do not specifically favor. 
abortion but believe that the" law  '

restricts basic human rights.

Mrs. Miller’s personal point of A I

view does not exclude the possibil-

ity of an abortion regulation on the. A. 
books, but rather “a positive law.’ .«
that punishes the physician for re- 
fusing to either administer anl  A 1
abortion to a woman who requests. 7 

it or to refer her to a physican
who will perform it.
NOT RANK AND FILE
She further claims that it is not

the rank and file of Catholics who 
oppose abortion reform. but the -

hierarchy of the church.
Besides Mrs. Miller. the AJA

consists of Dr. Maurice_ Cerul, , 
chairman, Mrs. Jay B.‘ Schiegg 
and M. ‘P. Powell; directors in- A‘ ;‘f*§
clude Dr. Rose Middleman, Dr.   i
Nancy Holt and the Rev. Alexan-

Other groups in the'Pittsburgh

area which provide abortion coun- :  
seling are the Student Help Center  
and the Women’s Liberation of — '_ 
Pittsburgh, which can be reached ’ ' if
through Dr. Roberta Salper, ext.

HAWAII

The island-state of Hawaii ‘I ' A
leads the nation in abortion
reform laws. The legislature

there recently passed‘ new
regulations which permit wo-
men less than 3 months preg-

nant to’ obtain therapeutic

ment to forestay an influx of 

out-of-state traffic.

it will never end, just as post-

mind of the young veteran.

Srtlper Notes Content Change

by HARRIS MILLER
Staff Writer

Those students wandering in-
to the Dean of the College's
office in the Cathedral may
think that the pert young red-
head scurrying about is just an-
other woman secretary. Those
students, however, ought not
think aloud for the young lady
is neither a secretary nor just
another woman. She is Dr. Ro-
berta Salper, Assistant Dean
of the College of Arts and Sci-
ences. Assistant Professor of
Hispanic Languages and Liter-
ative, and co-founder -of the
Women’s Liberation Organiza-
tion of Pittsburgh. I

Roberta, as she‘ is called by»

students and faculty alike, re-
ceived her Ph.D. degree in R0-
mance>Lnguages from Harvard.
Her activities range from auth-
oress (she is currently finishing
a book concerning the Spanish
novelist Ramon ‘deli Valle-In-
clan) to member of a national
commission createdby the Mo-

dern Language Association that‘

will study the status of woman
in la n g u a g e departments
throughout the United States.

These activities are secondary
tothe three courses‘ she teaches,

her job as assistant dean, and

her activities in Women’s Lib-
eration.

In regard to her faculty posi-

tion in the language depart-
ment, _i Roberta . commented -that
the abolition of the
requirement would have some
deleterious effects, in that. it
would reduce the number of stu-
dents taking languages.

She added, "I think the
change will be positive though,
in the long run. There are new
methods of ‘teaching effectively
being explored as well as an
emphasis on literature in trans-
lation and comparative litera-
ture. The emphasis on literature
in translation will allow the
uninitiated student a chance to
experience‘ the literature of sev-
eral countries.”

From‘ her position in
Dean’s office, Roberta has not-
iced three major changes that
have occurred in the University
in the past two years. “There
has been a change in form,”
she stated, “in that students
feel more free in communicating
with the people in the.‘Dean’s
office.” She also specified two
changes in content. “The first
important change is the institu-
tion of the course concerning
the history and social role of
women. Courses such as_t_his
are an integral part of women’s
liberation. The second impor-
tant change that I elaborated on
before is the comparative liter-
ature program,” she conclud-
ed. .

In her third, and probably
best known role as women’s
liberation advocate, Roberta ex-
presses» herself most decisively.
“If women are going to de-
mand social and economic equ-
ality with males, then the equal-
ity must go on down the line.
Women should be required to
serve in the armed forces just
as males. ‘There should be no
alimony,” she reasoned. She

the -

went on to point out that “hav-
ing doors opened, having checks
paid, and being put on ‘pedes-
tals’ makes women more passive
and thereby more susceptible to
male domination.”

In a final point of discussion,
Roberta expressed a feeling that
is of concern to all members of
the University. “I am alarmed
by the national. tendency to
downgrade ‘the importance of
higher education in the United

Symbols Foretell Future

by NANCY RUTHER
Staff Writer

_During the Symposium on
the Occult held in the Student
Union Ballroom on March 10,
Bob Hieronomous discussed
symbolism. Hieronomous, a sym-
bolic- painter from Baltimore,
Md., began a painting two and
a half years ago which even-
tually grew into a mural for
Johns Hopkins University. '

After a short but informative”

lecture onuniversal symbols and
their historical functions, the
speaker presented a series of
slides of the vibrant mural. The
mura1’s, main themes centered
around the Apocalypse; the Hor-

oscope, particularly the Age of ,

Aquarius; and the Lord’s Prayer.
These themes were expressed in
350 diverse symbols from vari-
ous mythologies. .The rnost-pre-
valent were the Egyptian pyra-
mids, the Greek trident of Nep-
tune, the Judaic star, the ankh.

  Glee Club Experiments Friday At Music Hal

by BILL GORMLEY
News Editor

The Men’s Glee Club will pre-
sent its annual spring concert Fri-
day evening at 8:30 p.m. in Car-
negie Music Hall. Sharing the
stage with the men will be the
Pennsyngers. the University of
Pennsylvania's women’s chorus.

The performance, which is open
t'ree of charge to the general pub-
lic, is slated to mark the group.s
80th anniversary. In honor of the
occasion, the Glee Club plans to
adopt a new look, experimenting
with a lighter style after appear-
ing formally.

During the first half of the con-
cert. the men will perform in tux-
edos, as has been customary. At.
this time. they will sing such num-
bers as Poulenc's Chanson 5
Boire. Copland’s Song of the Guer-
rillas, choral hymns from the Rig
Veda, and selections from Mc-
Cord‘s Menagerie. _

After changing into more casual
attire during intermission, the
Glee Club will entertain the audi-
ence with a staged musical revue.
Hallowed traditions will be trans-
cended as members of the group

kneel beside stools, and sit re-
laxed on risers while they sing.

Stamping a distinctive Ameri-
ican flavor on the second half of
the show, the men will give their
rendition of such folk ballads as
Deep River. Shenandoah. Charlot-
tetown, and By the Time I Get to
Phoenix. The group will also per-
form traditional Glee Club favor-
ites, including Brothers. Sing on
and Hall to Pitt.

A quartet,_ quintent, and octet

will also appear during the con-

cert‘s second half. The Pitt Tunes,

a barbershop quartet. will
emerge from the Glee Club's
ranks to sing a few of George M.
Cohan's most popular numbers.
The Varsity Quintet will present
several modern pieces and an oc-
tet will perform a Bach Invention
a la Swingle Singers.

The Men’s Glee Club, oldest ex-
tracurricular organization on
campus, has progressed rapidly
over the past few years under the
direction of Philip Cavanaugh, a
member of the faculty at Pitt.

Last year. the group performed
at a number of colleges and uni-
versities, including Vassar Col-
lege, Boston University. and the

University of Virginia. N e x t
month. the men will embark on a
ten-day tour which will take them
to Washington. D. C.. North Caro-
lina. Virginia. Kentucky. and De-
troit, Mich.

In addition to traveling. the men
often perform for local organiza-
tions. On Sunday, as a humanitari-
an gesture, they sang for inmates
at Mayview Mental Hospital.
Whenever possible. the Glee Club
tries to appear on campus. as
service to the University com-
munity.

The Glee Club, which will be re-
leasing an album shortly, has been
asked to sing at the Miss Pennsyl-
vania Pageant in Hershey this
summer, singing on televisoon be-
fore a statewide audience.

The group. which hopes to ap-
pear on the Ed Sullivan Show in
the near future, is currently be-
ing considered for a State Depart-
ment sponsored foreign tour. '

Since 1890, the Men’s Glee
Club has nurtured its traditions.
The organization intends to pre-
serve its cherished customs, but
on Friday night it will attempt to
supersede past performances.

Sports Editor

The Buffalo Bills of the National
Football League have announced the
acquisition of Chuck Gottfried as
offensive line coach. Until the an-
nouncement, Gottfried was the of-
fensive line tutor for Carl DePasqua’s
Panther gridders.

The Ex—Illinois University star
guard molded a questionable line
into a decent unit during the Pan-
thers’ comeback season in 1969.

After completing most of the
schedule Gottfried said of his unit,

~33, “The guys have done a great job.

They’ve improved more than any
other line I’ve coached.” 

,..|Chuek Gottfried Heads

It will be his job at Buffalo to
help open a few more holes for per-
haps the most publicized collegiate
player ever, 0. J. Simpson. If Simp-
son finds more holes this season than
he did last fall Gottfried will pro-
bably refuse to accept the credit,
though. '

He didn’t want anything written
about him during the Panther line
improvement. “The guys have got
to have it in their hearts,” he said.

DePasqua recognized the talents
of Chuck Gottfried, however.

“He’s a good one,” the head

coach said. “We hate like hell to lose
him.
“This is the ultimate in coach-

ing—the professionals. You don’t have
recruiting and the travelling," and
there’s the money.”

Gottfried began his coaching
career at Urbana High School in
Illinois and also coached at Thorn-
ton High in the same state.

In 1951 he moved to Idaho Uni-
versity to assume his first offensive
line post, which he held for five
years.

He also coached at Army and

Cornell before coming to Pitt last‘

August. '

Gottfried was unavailable for
comment to the Pitt News as he
headed for Buffalo to get started in

One of Baseball Coach Bobby Lewis‘ biggest problems last
year developed due to the weather. A total of nine games had to
be cancelled because ‘of rainyiconditions. Again this season. the
weatherman seems to be a big factor for the diamondmen.

"I hope the weather
warm enough so we can prac-
tice on the All-purpose Fields
as soon as possible,” Lewis com-
mented. “Until the weather co-
operates, we’ll be forced to con-
tinue\ in the Trees Hall Gym."

Lewis’ most pressing problem
right now is to establish the per-
menant members of the squad.
"The competition is still very
close for many positions," he
said. '"It will be difficult to
make decisions on a lot of guys
until I’m able to see how they
perform outside,” he added.

Up until now, the mitters
have been sharpening their hit-
ting eyes by slugging wiffle
balls at the gym and hitting in
the batting cage in the Field
House. '

However, Lewis is concerned
about the skills which the team
has been unable to parctice.
"When we move outdoors, the
boys will have the chance to
work long relays and cut off
plays,’-’ Lewis explained. "Also.
we’ll have the opportunity to
drill base running and steal-
ing, things which we have not
done yet.” '

The Athletic Department has

“There are many reasons," the

that the time it had to be plan-

speakers — was during the Uni--

When spring football practice
begins Monday, Coach Carl De-
Pasqua will expect the enthusi-
asm generated from the fall sea-
son to carry-over throughout the
month of drills.

'"We hope to strengthen the
areas hit by graduation. and also
try a few different things on

both offense and defense. Actu-.

ally. we’re looking for a carry-
over (in attitude) from last fall,“
DePasqua commented.

The’two essential aspects of
the spring drills are: analyzing
the personnel not yet seen and

introducing new routines. He
intends to achieve consistency
through experimentation and
perseverence. ’

said. “Also, we’ll be working
our younger boys into some of
our weaker areas.”

One trouble spot for DePas-
qua could be the vital quarter-
back position. Dave Havern and
two freshmen, Tom Hogan and
Tom Hasbach, are currently en-
gaged in the competition for top
signalcaller... '

Havern is returning for his
junior year _of eligibility after
being bumpedaoff the squad by
mononucleosis. Joe DeLisio is
another quarterback possibility.
but is questionable because of
academics.

“We would like to come up
with quarterbacks who are lead-
ers,” DePasqua remarked. “Right
now, I suppose that Havern
might hold the edge_ since he
has a_ whole year of experience

DePasqua indicated that de-

Varsity, Cubs Combine   
l7or 2-VVeek Session

by BILL NAAB
Associate Sports Editor

The Panther hoopsters are not competing in a post-season tour-
nament and will not confront a varsity opponent until December,

 and yet Coach Buzz Ridl has been drilling his squad since the
"  .~ season’s finale two weeks ago. ‘

Ridl has been blending this past*season’s freshmen _with the
varsity Panthers in the workouts and short scrimmages. He will

‘conclude this year’s practice on

4 Friday. The past two weeks of
_‘..drilling and next fall’s pre—sea-
no son

practice will determine
which players are in what roles

 4' 1‘ when ,1970—71’s opening buzzer

sounds.

“This isn’t just practice for
practice sake,” Ridl explained.
“We’1l be evaluating player

‘against player, evaluating the

freshmen as to how they’ll work
in with the varsity, and discov-
ering whether a player is more
effective in the frontcourt, back-
court, or as a swingman.”

If Ridl has been kicking any
more energy into one particular

,’part of the game it seems that

he might be concentrating on
putting more sting into his of-

A fensive attack.

“_V_Ve’ve been trying to im-
prove our play precision and
patterns. We’ve been attempt-
ing to execute with precision,”

A Ridl said.

Defensive coaching specialist

‘ 1 ’ Fran Webster has been orienting

the frosh to the zone and switch-
ing defenses. The Cubs are not
accustomed to buckling an ene-

1. my offense within the controls

of Webster’s intricate system.

.Throughout their initial season,

the frosh utilized a single setup’,

V the man-to-man defense.

Ridl, as of yet, has not struck

- upon a quintet which is vastly

superior to any other one. He
mentioned that the first week of
post-season action has not re-
vealed any eiilightening de-
tails.

“These two weeks are impor-
tant since we can evaluate our
players without pressure,” he
stated. “During this week we
should obtain a better idea of
things, but next fall we should
really be able to tell.

There haven’t been any real
surprises so far. Those who have
been impressive arn. those
we’ve expected to look good.”

The freshmen, according to
Ridl, have shown promise. He
also indicated that the Cubs fac-
ing the best opportunity to step
into the spots vacated by sen-
iors Mike Patcher and Jerry
Causer are the long-legged
Cubs (Carl Morris, Bill Sulkow-
ski, and Buzzy Harrison).$a

Tim Grugurich, the freshmen
coach, meanwhile has not shout-
ed one-order or offered a single
suggestion during the post-season
drilling.

Instead, he has spent his
time corresponding and visiting‘
potential recruits for next sea-
son’s Cub squad. During the
evenings Coaches Ridl and Web-
ster have also been sniffling the
trail of scholastic talent at the
sites of the high school tourna-
ment contests.

Tougher
Schedule

Season - 

Next winter Buzz Ridl’s cag-.

ers will play one more game
than they played‘ this year,
but that addition won’t be the
only thing that will make the
-schedule more difficult.
Athletic Director
Myslinski has announced the
1970-1971 hoop calendar, and
it lists some pretty tough new-
comers.

The

Casimir

Panther cagers

might

have to play UCLA, the nation’s ‘

best almost every year, lately.
The Bruins are listed as one of
the four teams for December’s
Steel Bowl at the Civic Arens.

The other squads on the card
for the tournament are Duquesne
and William and Mary. -

The Cagers are certain the
will play a few other difficult
teams next year. '

Five quintets appearing in
this season’s NCAA and ‘NIT
tourneys are on the schedule.

Don’t Touch
Her F ence!

by ED CONLEY
Sports Editor

Sheila Larkin. a sophomore at Pitt. doesn‘t think of her back
yard when she hears the word “fence". as most women would.

The physical therapy student has attached herself to the ath-
letic endeavor known as fencing and, by her own admission, she’s

pretty good at it.

.She is a novice, top, having taken up the activity only last

H V831‘.

“It takes ten years to become a good fencer,” she says. “Yeah,

I feel that I’m qualified to
fence, if nothing else.”

She knows there is such a
thing as over—confidence and she
says that she doesn't possess it.
She also knows that her compe-
tition is usually more experi-
enced than her.

Last Saturday she competed
in the Women’s French Foil
division of the Classified Fenc-
ing Tournament at the Down-
town YWCA. Her sixth place
finish qualifies her for a section-
al tourney in Maryland in May
and the national title tourney in
New York City in July.

The top two finishers in the
Saturday meet were Stella Saures
of Pleasant Hills and Beth Mur-
ray of Murraysville, both exper-
ienced fencers. Miss Saures, in
fact, first competed in 1939.

“It wasn’t a question of whe-
ther she would win or not,”
Sheila said. “It was just a
question of being courteous.
Fencers are courteous.”

Considering the nice manners
of fencers, the way that Sheila
became interested in the sport is
rather strange;it wasn’t a very

1 formal thing.

sizes 30 to 36.

“One day I walked across the
California State campus (where
she was attending classes) and
there was Mr. Walter Carter (an
instructor) with his swagger
stick. I am athletically inclined
anyway and it was just a natur-
al interest.

“I was fortunate to meet and
talk to him.

Mr. Carter began the fencing
career of Sheila Larkin last
August, so Sheila must feel
tremendously gratified by her
quick progress, right?

“I just think of fencing as a
sport of conditioning,” she says,
not really making her pleasure
evident. “In a sense it prepares
you for life without really being
aware of it. It teaches your eyes
how to look, and things like
that——like drama school.”

Jim Banners’ track squad
has one more meet left in
their 1970 indoor season. This
Saturday they will travel to
Cleveland for the Knights of
Columbus meet.

The Pitt rifle team came
through when the chips were
down by beating Clarion State
in a grudge match by a score
of 1323-1312.

Earlier this season, Pitt de-
feated Clarion by 29 points.
But Clarion protested the results
to the West-Penn league office
because of alleged irregularities
in the procedures of the previous
match. So a rematch was sche-

duled.
