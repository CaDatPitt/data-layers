Peg Luksik, known as the
“Housewife from Johnstown,”
came to Pitt yesterday, proclaiming
that Pennsylvania voters want an
alternative to government as usual.

Meeting with about 20 support-
ers for a campaign rally in the
Assembly Room of the William Pitt
Union, Constitutional Party candi-
date Luksik spoke_on issues such as
abortion, education, .reform and
putting God back where he belongs
—— in the fabric of American soci-
ety.
God was worked

God, things

together pretty well,” Luksik said. .
“But when people decided to make.

man god, things began to break
down.”

“When society realized that’

Luksik is running for governor
of Pennsylvania in the general elec-
tion to be held on Nov. 3. This is
her third bid for the seat.

S Beginning her7'political career
in 1990 as a contender in the
Republican -primary for governor,-
Luksik ran against current state
treasurer Barbara Hafer, garnering
49 percent of the vote. While she
didn’t win in the primary, she did
much better than anyone, including
herself, imagined. She said this
made her realize that many
Pennsylvanians. were unsatisfied
with politics and wanted a change.

Fouryears later she tried again,
this time running for governor as
an Independent candidate, She won
13 percent of the vote, the highest
figure ‘ ever attained by an
Independent in apstatewide election
since the early 1900s. '

“The response is always very
positive because she is very articu-
late,” said Marlene Wohleber, the
southwestern Pennsylvania coordi-

~_.nator'fo'r the Luksik gubernatorial

campaign. “She is a very good
teacher and she is able to take com-.
plex issues and make them under-
standablef.’ .

Students for Life, Pitt’s pro-life
campus organization, invited
Luksik to speak, and she accepted
the offer. While less than two
dozen people attended the rally,
Luksik said the visit was worththe
effort. _

“I guess I’ve been in»(politics)
long enough to know that success
isn’t‘ in the number of people
attending,” Luksik -said. _

Researchers say new pill may
have some effect as exercise

Adam’ Woodroof

  

 

Rocky Mountain Collegian

FORT COLLINS, Colo. (U-
wire) — A new drug that would

eliminate the body’s need for exer— .

cise is being looked into after a
recent discovery by a team of scien-
tists at the University of Texas
Southwestern Medical Center at
Dallas.

The team discovered a genetic-
switch that tells muscles how to»

behave. The scientists discovered a
way.» to reproduce the molecular
events associated with exercise.
This information could someday
lead to a pill that would cause the
same molecular events to take place

in the muscles, without the aid of

exercise.

Finding a molecularpathway
that directs the development of
muscle fiber in the body, the scien-
tists discovered that the pill could
help people form either strength-
type muscles body builders have or
endurance-type muscles formed by
aerobic exercise.

Using cultured muscle cells, the
scientists traced the biochemical-

signaling mechanism that changes

the muscle fiber type from one kind
to another. ’

“We believe this pathway pro-

vides »a molecular explanation for
the important effects of aerobic
exercise in increasing physical
endurance and reducing risk for
cardiovascular disease,” said team
leader Dr- R. Sanders Williams,
chief of fcardiology and director of
the Frank M. Ryburn Jr. Cardiac
Center in a press release.

“When people go jogging, mol-
ecular events happen in the muscles
they are exercising that, both
enhance their capability to exercise
further and improve their health,”
the release said.

“We have shown both in cul-

tured cells and in animals that there,
is a signaling pathway we can mod-.

ify to stimulate or reverse what

exercise does‘ naturally,” Williams 5
said. “We believe it is possible to‘

design a drug which would have
this effect.” A ‘

Students relcile experiences of African pilgrimage

Aderonke Omotade

Staff Writer

For 12 days this summer, Colleen
Crittenden toured Africa with a group of

- Pittsburgh students.

On one of thosedays, she sat with
the ambassador of the Ivory Coast at a
cocktail party.

“I never thought I’d be attending a
cocktail party hosted by the ambassador
of (the Ivory Coast),” Crittenden said.

Crittenden, a senior biology major,

was one of ﬁve Pitt. students who trav-

eled to Africa this summer, touring key
places such as the Basilica Notre—Dame
de la Paix and Banco Forest.

Fifty—two people went ‘on the trip,
including students from Carnegie
Mellon ‘ University, Duquesne
University, Point Park College,
Westinghouse High "School and the
Pittsburgh Theological Seminary.

Chancellor Mark Nordenberg spon-
sored scholarships so Pitt students could
fund their trips, which included stops in
Ghana, Senegal and the Ivory Coast.

The Urban League of Pittsburgh-
sponsored the trip in celebration of its
80th anniversary.

While in Ghana, students toured the
slave castles atElmira, the museums of
Kwame Nkrumah, and the homes of
W.E.B. DuBois and the prime minister.
The tour also stopped in the capital city
of Accra, the city of Kumasi and the
University of Ghana.

The ﬁnal destination of the pilgrim-
age was Senegal, where the students vis-
ited the slave castle on Goree Island, the
Grand Mosque, ‘Dakar University,
Sandanga Market and_ the president’s
palace.

“It was an unbelievable experi-
ence,” Crittenden said. “I still can’t
believe that I went.”

Pitt student J onella Gavin called the I

trip a profound experience.

“When I got off the plane and knew
I was on African ground, it moved me
because I felt I was finally home,” she
said. “(The trip) dispelled every stereo-
type that had been ingrained in me since
childhood.” ‘

Gavin said she found the countries
the group visited .to be very developed,
commercialized and equipped with
modern technology.

To Gavin, the fact that stereotypes
about Africa as an undeveloped wilder-
ness are still rampant on Pitt’s campus
was made clear by the number of peo-
ple who asked her if she saw lions while
in Africa. .

Crittenden said the most memorable
part of the trip for her was the children.

“They were so innocent and happy
compared to the kids (in America),’’ she
said.

A University committee worked in
conjunction with the Provost’s office to

select the students who went on the trip.

The selection process for Crittenden
included being nominated by a faculty
member, providing a resume and col-
lege transcripts, and being interviewed
for 45 minutes by a selection committee.

Not every person who went on the
trip was chosen through this formal
process. Jack Daniel, vice provost for
Academic Affairs, also approached peo-
ple on the street and talked to them to
determine whether they would make
good candidates, according to a spokes-
woman, Adrianne Masey.

It was Daniel’s impromptu inter-
view that opened the possibility of going
to Africa for Gavin. I

 

“I was walking down the street,”
she said. “Jack Daniel was standing

‘there, introduced himself and asked if

(I) wanted to go to Africa  and the rest
was history.”

The Urban League of Pittsburgh, in
conjunction with the National Urban
League, is in the process of planning
another trip to Africa in the spring. The
excursion will be open to any student
who can provide his or her own funding.

Esther Bush, president and CEO of
the Urban League of Pittsburgh, said she
is unaware of any scholarships for the
spring similar to those Chancellor
Nordenberg sponsored over the summer.

Pittsburgh Police accident
investigators said they are going to

subpoena health records of the dri— ’

ver of a truck that crashed through a
Pitt building last week," killing an

elderly pedestrian and injuring
another.
William Fady, 83, of North

Sammie Dornin, a patrolman at

the Pittsburgh Police accident inves— -

tigation- division, said mechanical

failure of the truck was not to blame.

for the accident, which remains
under investigation.

Results of theinvestigation will
not be known for a couple of weeks,
Dornin _said.

The accident happened , at
approximately 1:20 p.m. last
Wednesday. Witnesses said the truck
was traveling along Forbes Avenue
toward the Pitt campus when it sud-

denly veered across oncoming traf— ‘

fic and onto the sidewalk. The truck
came to rest in the storeroom of Life
Uniform, at the corner of Forbes
Avenue and McKee Place.

Several people in Life Uniform
were able to jump out of the way
moments before the truck crashed
through the building’s glass facade.

The building, at 3501 Forbes
Ave., is owned by Pitt, which rents
most of the space to Life Uniform
and . Western Pennsylvania
Psychiatric Institute, according to
Pitt Spokesman Ron Cichowicz.

A damage estimate has not yet
been made.

that can sense the movement of a sin-
gle electron moving across a wire in a
manner 1,000 times faster than any
comparable device. V

“We built an electrometer using a
single electron transistor, which for
the first time has the speed and the

» sensitivity to measure the state of

solid state quantum bit before it loses
its coherence,” Schoelkopf said.

Schoelkopf’s discovery brings to-

an end a 10-year odyssey for a device
that would solve one of quantum
physics’ great mysteries: how elec-
trons move from one place to another.

“Certainly for the last decade this
has been an important general issue in
physics,” Prober said.

Because Schoelkopf’s device is
fast enough to measure the movement
of an electron across a wire, scientists
can now examine the pattern of elec-
tron motion —— whether electrons

move in “single” file or in a random’

fashion.

The device that the Yale team built
is remarkably simple.

Schoelkopf modified an" ordinary
single electron transmitter by adding a
radio wave emitter. Scientists can
detect the ﬂow of the individual elec-

Yalephysicisls solve decade-old electron mystery

tron by examining the bouncing radio
wave off of the electron. .
The Yale transistor could be the

. basis of a future generation of super-

computers known as quantum com-
puters, which exploit- the huge poten-
tial of ‘ subatomic particles. a

By building a computer based on
quantum technology, these future
supercomputers willbe at least thou-
sands of times faster than today’s
CRAY machines».

Although Schoelkopf’s ingenious
discovery will help answer a funda-
mental theoretical question, his dis-
covery also has immediate tangible

applications.

The National Aeronautics and
Space Administration is already fund-

ing two research projects which use

Schoelkopf’s transistor.

Because his transistors are much
more sensitive than ordinary ones,
NASA would be able to use the Yale
discovery to build better sensors for
X—ray, visible light and microwave

detectors used in scientific research.

The government agency is also
currently considering’ funding two
additional research projects at Yale in
similar areas.

ple that were more productive than
some rallies with over 400 people
present.

Where‘ abortion stood at the
forefront of Luksik’s campaign in
the past, this election it is joined by
such issues as upholding the right to
bear arms, school choice and return-
ing control of health care to the con-
sumer. ~

Even with the expansion of her
campaign platform, abortion quick-
ly became the topic of conversation
Monday night.

.“We’ve got a governor that trav-
els around the state giving out
money, saying that he is going to
change Pennsylvania honestly,”
Luksik said. “What I see is a gover-
nor who says he’s anti-abortion, yet
funds abortion providers.” '

She called the. right to life the
most fundamental of human rights
and something that government is
called on to protect. ~

“If government can say thatone
group of people has no rights, then
you don’t have anything,” she said.
“This is the basis for tyranny.”

Widely known as an expert in
education issues, Luksik is angry
with a recent figure that found_39
percent of Pennsylvania fourth-
graders could not read. She said the

Ridge administration’s solution is to
ﬂing money into a damaged system
instead of fixingits problems.

“If a plumber had a business
where 39 percent of his pipes
leaked, chances are no one would
invest in his business,” Luksik said.
“But this is what" Pennsylvania tax-
payers are being asked to do.”

While current state law stipu-
lates that only 24,000 signatures are
required for a third party to be

placed on the election ballot, Luksik A

filed 77,000 petition names from all
67 counties, meeting with people
throughout the state and forming a
strong volunteer base in the process.

« She has also raised $800,000 in
campaign funding, twice eclipsing
the amount gathered in her 1994
sophomore effort and burying
Democratic candidate Ivan Itkin’s
fundraising attempts almost 10 to
one, she said.

Even in the face of Gov. Ridge’s
$12 million in campaign money,
Luksik supporters remain optimistic
for their modern-day Joan of Arc.

“Most people who have been
paying attention to politics will

know who she is — more than Ivan

Pitt Police patrolman Kevin

“It was students acting like typ-

over an hour,” he said.

Many residents of McCormick
broke away from their normal activ-
ities to watch the rescue.

Because the car was stuck

between floors two and three,

medics opened both sets of doors.‘
It took approximately one hour
and 20 minutes to get the elevator
doors open on the third ﬂoor.
Medics, looking down on the
students who’d been granted a
breath of fresh air by the open
doors, told everyone to wait until

the second-ﬂoor doors were also

opened.
Finally, around 10:35 p.m., the

Republicans, Democrats mediocre;
third party no better

On Nov. 3, Pennsylvanians
will once again go to the polls to
decide who their governor and
members of Congress will be.

Incumbent Gov. Tom Ridge
looks like the heavy favorite, with
Democrat Ivan Itkin barely regis-
tering in the opinions polls, due to

‘ poor campaigning. This begs the
question: Why bother ,voting either
Republican or Democrat?

America’s current two-party
system is preposterous: The line
between Republican and Democrat
is blurred and party members hop »
back and forth between tickets.

_ Both churn out the same genetic
campaign rhetoric — ﬁght crime,
improve education, etc. -— with the
only differences lying in peripheral
issues such as abortion and school

A prayer.

Why is there such an outcry
against low voter tumout, when
Ridge and Itkin are the best either
party has to offer the electorate?
It’s easier to blame voter apathy
(particularly the “indifferent”
Generation X) than it is to criticize
the two major parties for. consis-
tently brewing a mediocre batch of
candidates.

However, in reply to the two-
party system, there have been sev-
eral third parties vying for the pub-,

have been consistent in one regard:
All of them have been as mediocre
and uninspiring as the Republicans
and Democrats. ' '
The Libertarian Party comes
off as a party that takes Democratic
social measures and mixes them
with Republican economic ideas,
with the leftovers being the only
things based on the actual doctrine

of libertarianism. The Reform.

Party is known for only one thing:
Ross Perot. ’

In Pennsylvania, as a third ‘

option for governor, voters will be
treated to the Draconian platform
of the “housewife from
Johnstown,” Constitution Party
candidate Peg Luksik. Though
many in Harrisburg predict that she
will trounce Itkin on Nov. 3 and her
message is consistent, she is no dif-
ferent from a hard-core right-wing
Republican.

Ifyou don’t want car emissions
testing, vote for Luksik. If you
believe in defending life from con-
ception to natural death, vote

. Luksik. (The hypocrisy in this

belief is that she fervently supports
the Second Amendment and the
death penalty.) ~

Nothing fresh, nothing new. If
Ridge, Itkin and Luksik are the
three top options for Pennsylvania,

is it really worth voting at all?

Nice dorm room: What's that smell?  

Last year, I lived in temporary housing for a
few weeks. My only problem with living in the
15th ﬂoor lounge of Tower C was the amount of
people who used the elevator, their destinations
and departures - for some unknown‘ reason" -
being none other than the third ﬂoor.

I would curse these people’s existence,
grumbling about their laziness and lack of per-

sonal hygiene. A few months later, I moved to _

that same third ﬂoor. I used the elevator. I’m lazy.

I probably started out thinking, “Oh, great! I
can just walk down! I don’t need to wait for the
elevators!” But after a while, I just seemed to rea-
son it out. I could either walk down two ﬂights

of stairs to the lobby, or I could stand and wait for _

one of the elevators. I believed this misuse of my
God-given lifetime was convenient. T

This basic reasoning seems to be the core
logic inevery lazy pe1son’s thinking:
convenience over personal effort.
For the sake of convenience, many
I.othrop residents have even urinated
in their dorrn-room sinks. ('Ihis is an
exaggeration; a few of the women .
have not tried it yet.) Many people believe phys-
ical ﬁtness is a part of Lothrop residents’ every-
day lives. When I moved in, I had hoped it would
be a part of mine. _

- Recently, in Schenley, I opened a line of,
communication with some pleasant females.
(Remember, communication keeps relationships
strong.) The conversation led to my explaining
that I write for The Pitt News —- as conversations
invariably do —- and they asked that I write
about the poor cleaning service at Sutherland.

— Lazy people can most often be seen on the
weekends, as ﬂiey cart bags of laundry to their

weekend, but since I’m going home ... ” When
they have to make numerous trips, the truth is
pretty obvious. These people should be pitied,
since they extend their undergarment supply
through the wearing of inside-out socks and the
omission of underwear. But lazy
people have their good points.

Lazy people, despite the nega-
tive connotation, are good for the
economy. I admit, I do not know
much about the economy. All I retain

The tenure of Student Government
Board president Alyson .Wallach was
beyond reproach until last Wednesday,
when readers of the Opinions section came
across an apology-for an article, published
the previous day, mentioning Wallach . The
editor’s apology noted explicitly that the
article was not to have been taken seriously
and explained that the piece in question was
not intendedto be a “negative article,” rais-

ing the question: Is it really editorial policy "

to refrain from printing “negative articles?”
If not, in which case The Pitt News had no

reason to defend its action, then just how

does one account for the apology?

Well, I’Ve pissed off enough authorities
that I can claim a certain measure of exper-
tise on the matter, and I imagine something
like the following sequence of events
occurred: Wallach read the article, missed
the point of it and became indignant That’s
usually where the story ends for most peo-

ple “cast in a bad light” (as the apology”

read). However, the president decided to

take action, possessing, after all, a reputa-

tion to defend and the power to defend it.
Perhaps she had ofﬁcials check their

computers for the article’s author, the unfor- A

trmate Adrian Kimble. Maybe she visited a
few high-ranking bureaucrats to express her
indignation, and those bureaucrats —— never
fond of that ﬁree speech nonsense anyway
—— took some time out of their hectic sched-
ules to ﬂex their bureaucratic muscles and
reprimand the newspaper on Wallach’s
behalf. Possibly, Wallach stormed into The

I Pitt News oﬂice and demanded to speak to

the top editors, calling for censure and, per-
chance, even for dramatic eﬁect, appearing
on the verge of tears. (I’ve seen it all too
many times — even from men!)

In the face of all ﬂiose pressuring
bureaucrats and a teary-eyed president, The
Pitt News capitulated If in fact my story
resembles what really happened, what
Wallach did constituted an abuse of her
authority. In France, ' literature targeting
celebrities or authorities deemed otfensive
is frequently censored by politicians. But
we don’t live in France.

(I’ve done a bit of research on my own
concerning just who Adrian Kimble is, and
to my surprise I’ve found absolutely noth-
ing. The oﬁcials who deal with student
records deny he was ever a student, the stu-
dent directory does not list him and no one
seems to remember him at all. It’s a case of
mysterious disappearance leading me to
unsettling speculation -— (does SGB wield

more power than we think? Does Adrian
Kimble sleep with the ﬁshes?)

Presuming (Wallach did in fact miss
entirely the humor of the article, we should
not respect her indignation for several rea-
sons. The Pitt News has no responsibility to
ﬁlter opinions for potentially offensive
material — every viewpoint is potentially
offensive, come to think of it. Even an opin-
ion advocating looking both ways before

‘crossing the street might offend someone‘

whose religion demands, upon pain of
damnation or whatever, that people cross
the street without regard for "cars. (Religions
are often more ridiculous than that)

Above all, one should ignore Wallach’s
indignation because she struggled to
become a public ﬁgure. That title carries
with ‘it not only respect, authority and
cachet on her resume, but also the possibil-
ity of public criticism and even ridicule.
Wallach apparently wants all the glory with
none of the shame.

_ Then again, perhaps it is too much to
presume that Wallach was so blind to the
humorous intentions of the author, and this
raises another disturbing possibility: maybe
Wallach did recognize the article as‘inno-
cently amusing but she decided to feign
indignation anyway. Why would she do
this? She could have decided that most Pitt

students lack- the intelligence to recognize a ,

humorous article,'in which case someone
with authority (like her) must sift out the
opinions to detemrine what is readable and

what’s too easily misunderstood. This is an -

insulting possibility, and I hope it’s not the
case. — »
But if that is not the case, then I have
to accept that Wallach (and others, too)
could not see the article for what it was -—
namely, pure jest. How can The Pitt News
avoid these misunderstandings in the
future, with blatant and obvious humor
being presenﬂy celebrated (Jim Carrey, for
example), granting that parody is better
subtle?

I suggest a ratings system for opinions
so that thosetotally devoid of a sense of
humor will be able to understand the
autl1or’s intentions clearly. Such a system
would help people like Wallach avoid the
undue indignation and tears caused by mis-
understanding ridiculous articles. Free
expression is valuable, but perhaps it is too
much to expect of people to read the opin-
ions of others and, like alcohol, appreciate
them responsibly.

bottom of the Ohio Riverif the wrong peo-/_

ple take offense to this article.

 

Go out and see
the women’s
soccer team

Pittsburgh Panther ‘women’s soc-

cer. .
Huh?

Guess what? Pitt does have a
women’s soccer team, and it is good.
I know many of you who have been

here think I’m full of a lot of stuff,’

butthis time I’m serious. Our
women’s soccer team has come to

' play this year, and this shows in its

record.

For those of you who have been
here since the‘fall of 1996 and know
or dopnot know about the storied tra-
dition of Pitt women’s soccer, bear
with me. For the rest of you, here’s a
crash course in women’s soccer histo-
ry. .
The Lady Panther soccer team
was bad, really bad. In its first year,
the team won only one game and was
not in the Big East Conference due to
a rule prohibiting first—year programs
from joining the conference.

‘Head coach Roland Sturk came to
Pittsburgh with hopes for a great pro-
gram. Those hopes were not realized
as the as the team ﬂoundered during

9 - its first few years..

Sturk brought several of recruits
with him from Colorado, but these
players could not make an immediate

impact because they were young and

inexperienced. I .

The first year, only Heather
Ferguson stepped in as a junior and
played for the Lady Panthers.

If you’ve gotten this far, you must
be wondering how the hell I knowall
of this, Well, I had the pleasure of

‘ covering the teamfor two years.

Anyway, the team“ continued to
improve and the women showed
ﬂashes of brilliance in their second
season. With their first Big East win
and a couple of good recruits, the
Lady Panthers had a shot. g

But that shot was not evident. The
team kept losing and couldn’t score.
The Lady Panthers played good
defense, but that wasn’t getting them
anywhere.

This year is a different story. The
Lady Panthers are scoring arid win-
ning —— a sigh of relief for the juniors
who came in the first year of this pro-
gram and have dug it ‘out of a huge
hole.

The team has already won ﬁve

For The Pltt News

— The Lady Panther volleyball team
“killed ‘em all” this weekend. While-away
at Harvard, the team beat all comers, win-
ning four of four games in the tournament.

The action began on Friday with
rnatchups against Harvard and St. John’s.

The team’s ﬁrst match against the Crimson ,

was its ﬁrst win in its sweep of the compe-
tition. With 13, 14, and 21 killsby Melissa
Alpers, Jenna Birkel and Marcia Thiesen
respectively, the offense did what it is
expected to do and threw in a few aces for
good measure. Alpers and Thiesen also reg-
istered double-doubles in the‘ match.

Pitt’s defense showed Harvard what a
dig was, in addition to amassing 13 blocks
to the Crirnson’s 7. Final game scores were
7-15, 15-12, 15-10 and 15-5.

The victorious Panthers then squared
off against St. John’s. This match was. a
fairly even struggle. The Panthers had 67
kills to St. John’s 63, sixaces to St. John’s
ﬁve, and 79 digs to St. John’s 89.

The Panther defense recorded six
blocks, and the team had four double-dou-
ble performances in Jessica Van der Mallie,
Peggy Meinhart, Thiesen and Alpers. Final
scores were 13-15, 15-12, 16-10 and 15-6.

On Saturday, Pitt defeated Manhattan

‘aces, 41 digs, and

College’ in three
games of 15-11, 15-3 —-z.:
and 15-10. The
Panthers had an
impressive .299 hit-
ting percentage with
43 team kills, eight

   

eight blocks. ’
Finally, the Lady
Panthers beat Brown,
a team with a 6-4
record, a .263 hitting
percentage and a sti-
ﬂing defense. Sixteen
Panther blocks to
Brown’s one were the
nucleus of an over-
powering victory. The
team recorded 34
team kills, 10 aces
and 38 digs. Thiesen
led the ‘way with
eight kills, six digs

Men's soccer loses two games during weekend 3

The Pittsburgh Panthers men’s soc-
cer team was handed its second shutout
in two games and its second Big East
loss in a row against the Providence
Friars.’ ‘ ’

‘p‘Wei didn’t play with the emotion
and intensityiwe need to play with in the
Big East,” said coach Joe Luxbacher.

The loss dropped the Panthers to 1-
2--1 in the conference and 4-2-2 overall.

Providence came out /ﬁred up in the
opening minutes of the match, penetrat-
ing the Pittsburgh zone. This’ tight offen-

sive start from the Friars -‘set the tone for

the rest of the game.

The opening goal the eventual
game- winner came at the 37 minute
mark, when Friars forward Kevin Jones
scored on a cross-ﬁeld pass.

Jones struck again, registering the
only other goal of the game for
Providence in the second half, when he

scored on a breakaway in the 46th

minute.
Though Pittsburgh didn’t tally a

score, the team had a few chances in the
contest. Phil Matilla was stopped on a
breakaway in the 35th minute. The

Panthers also registered two shots, each,

ringing off the post and crossbar but
unable to ﬁnd their way. into the net.
Friar goalkeeper Dan Pires registered
eight saves on the day.

Those were the only three shots on
goal in the whole contest for Pittsburgh,
giving Pires’ a
shutout for the
afternoon. Panther
goalkeeper Chris
Hanlon recorded
one save on only.
three shots on goal
for Providence.

“We had plenty
of time to get ready
for this game, I
don’t know where
our offense was,
our intensity level
was zero,” said
team captain Drew

Kopp.

 

Luxbacher was equally displeased with

‘yesterday’s performance, which gives

Pitt a losing record in the Big East.

"‘We played poorly _ as a team. » In
these big games our leaders need to step
it up. They didn’t do that today,” he said.

The Panthers will try to better their
Big East record at home’ tonight against
backyard rival West Virginia at 7:30 in
Pitt Stadium. -

After starting the season at 5-2, the
women’s soccer team began a two-game
road trip. The team traveled to the Air
Force Academy in Colorado and the
University of Wyoming over the weekend.

Air Force beat the Panthers 2-0 on
Friday. After stealing a Panther pass, the
Falcons got on the board with a goal from
Becky Wyfells. The Falcons scored again
on a goal by Jennie Schoeck, who scored
on a header off a comer kick. I

The trip to Wyoming was also unsuc-
cessful for the Lady Panthers. The team
fell to Wyoming 2-0 in Sunday’s game.

Katrina Morton scored the ﬁrst goal

on a bullet in the right comer of the net.
Wyoming" would score again eight min-
utes later on a goal from,Erica Campbell.
The Panthers only managed six and
seven shots inrthe two games, resulting in
a pair of shutouts. But the losses may only
be a slump, not a real concern for the team,

as the Lady Panthers have so far had a suc-
cessful offensive season.

“We haven’t played well this past
week,” said head coach Roland Sturk.

While ﬂie offense has struggled, the
defense has played well.

“I was happy with the waywe played A

defensively,” said Sturk.

The road trip may have -taken its toll
on the team. - ._ -

“We’re a young team and we lackthe
maturity to play well on the road,” said
Sturk. ' .

Seven of the first nine games have
been played on the road, so the team is
looking forward to its upcoming four-
game home stand. ’ V

The Panthers haven’t lost at home in
two tries.

The women have come out of the gate
hot, but seem to be cooling off a bit. The

team looks to reverse this trend Friday, ‘

Harris criticizes offense, but praises strong defense

David Turner

Staff Writer

Head football coach Walt Harris
had only words of praise about his
team’s defensive efforts, while criticiz-
ing the offensive squad at his weekly
press conference yesterday.

“We had a very tough football game

last week. We went down to Virginia»

Tech and played in a championship-
type atmosphere. Our defense played
extremely well — started a little slow,
but took control of the ball game,”
Harris said. “Unfortunately, our offense
was not ready to execute at the level
that you had to execute.at in order to to
play against a highly ranked defensive

football team like Virginia Tech, and we ‘

fell short.”

Harris made it clear he was proud
of the team’s defensive efforts in both
Saturday’s 27-7 loss to the Hokies and
at the Penn State game two weekends
ago. .
“Being a defensive coach in college
for ten years and a coordinator as well
during some of those years, I know you
win championships on defense. We’re

very excited about the fact that we are_

developing a defensive attitude,’ and I
appreciate the defense very, very much
because they have to be a little patient
with the offense F and sometimes play
over their heads while the offense. is try-
ing to grow up,” Harris said. ‘

_ The defensive involvement in the
near-comeback was especially impor-
tant because the Hokies had the more
physically developed squad, according
to Harris. ' -

“I believe that the inside players
from Virginia Tech, as well as the over-
all speed and quickness of their team,
really were too much for us. And yet,
we stillhad a chance. I think that’s what
I admire most about our football team

A and football players,” Harris said. “The

last two weeks we have lost, but we’ve
been in thgball game.” , *

‘ On offense, chief among Harris’
criticisms was quarterback Matt Lytle,
who was replaced by junior transfer
Matt O’Connor,early in the fourth quar-
ter. But Harris by no means put all of
the blame on Lytle for the nine total
sacks Pitt allowed. .

“We have to shore up parts of our

game in order to take some pressure off .

him. We have got to run the football a
lot better, with a lot more authority than
what we are running. Honestly, we have
to block better in pass protection, and
he has got; to do a better job of getting
rid of the football,” Harris said. “All in
all, I think that he played competitively,

he just has to improv_e his consistency.”-

Harris had ‘a harsh judgement on the
play of ‘Pitt’s backﬁeld, which‘ gained

Tennis wins three

Fred Shrayber
For The Pitt News

After its loss to Bloomsburg
University last week, what might have
seemed a questionable beginning for the
women’s tennis team became a little
brighter. The tennis team ﬁnished off its
weekend with three overpowering wins
to improve its record to 3-1.

The first win came Saturday
against Cleveland State University,
when the Lady Panthers lifted them-
selves to a convincing 9-0 victory.

The second win came from the
University of Buffalo, which left empty-
handed after its 8-1 loss. The last team
to try to outplay the Lady, Panthers,
Canisius College, also left with a score
of 8-1. ,

With these impressive scores, the
tennis team should be much more conﬁ-
dent today than it was on Friday.
Although faring well against
Bloomsburg last week, the team was
handed a 6-2 loss.

In the Bloomsburg game, Alison
Bucher won for the Panthers, along with
the doubles team of.Bucher and Lindsay
Carlson. Unfortunately, the rest of the
team lost. , .

The three wins this weekend
should provide some foundation for the
upcoming Youngstown State University

game tonight. It won’t be an easy match
for the Lady Panthers, but the team
looks more than ready to step onto the
battleﬁeld.

“This is a coachable team and they
are working very hard,” said’ coach
George Dieffenbach.

Dieffenbach "emphasized the
team’s convincing effort this weekend
and said the Lady Panthers. are prepar-
ing—for their upcoming battle. V

Dieffenbach has several reasons to
be optimistic, including the team’s num-
ber—one ranked player, Sarah Austin.
Although having the only loss. on
Sunday, she is a bright prospect for the
team. ‘

Erin Shalbrack, a senior from

‘Maple Glenn, Pa., is ranked second and

is paired with Austin in doubles match-
es. Dieffenbach is excited. about all of
his players, crediting everyone with a
good effort and a good record to show
for it. t '

Except for Austin, all the Pitt
women won their matches last weekend '
. The other Lady Panthers dominated in
a clean sweep.

The team was 11th out of 13 last
year, and Dieffenbach”s goal is to
improve at least one notch‘ this season.
With the good first four matches in
hand, the team is looking for an exciting
game and an equally exciting victory.

'I'ui:snAv, 29 SEPTEMBER 1998

HARRis

we were unlucky,’ you know? We’ve
got to make our luck. We got to make it
happen. And we had some chances. If
we were. more disciplined, we had a
chance to put the ball in the end zone
enough to probably win that football
game, because if they were having to
play to win, instead of playing keep
away from us, I think our defense
would have. done even better against
them,” he said.

Adding to Pitt’s_ offensive question
marks is senior wide receiver Terry
Murphy, who may not be able to over-
come his ankle injury in time for this
weekend’s game against Akron.

Though Harris was very critical of
his young team, he remains optimistic
about the future.

“As we improve, we will win
games,” he said.
