‘'9 i980. The Pill News WIRE SERVICE

By SETH LUBOVE

 Pitt News Staff Writer

Although Pitt’s board of trustees passed a budget this summer

<:,:,-, calling for increases in tutiton rates, further tuition hikes are possi-

ble this winter.

The trustees voted July 7 to adopt a $254.6 million operating
budget for fiscal year 1980-81 with increases in tuition rates averag-
ing around 12.5 percent. This meant the Oakland undergraduate
was paying $200 more per term for tuition. ,

But now, with the possible 10 percent across-the-board slash in
state appropriations by Gov. Thornburgh scheduled for Oct. 1, Pitt
and other Pennsylvania state-related university students can expect
to pay even higher tuitions this winter. 5 . . 

Pit_t’s budget was passed under the assumption that the universit; ’

"would receive an appropriation of $71~.069 million, a sum already
passed by the legislature but awaiting final‘ approval by the gover-
nor. But when the governer announced that an unanticipated $33
million budget. shortfall would necessitate an “abatement” of the
‘ original appropriations, _speculation centered on further tuition

hikes and belt-tightening within.the university system.
Circumstances surrounding the abatement of appropriations

have sparked «heated debate between the General Assembly and the
governor, partisan politics weighing heaiiily in the sides taken in the
argument. ‘ '

The budget deficit affecting the appropriations was created this
summer when the legislature rejected a $15 million licensing fee bill
and the Liquor Control Board reneged on an earlier commitment to
provide, $26 million through price. increases or a 10-cent-a-bottle

surchar/ge. . ‘ . ' ,_ - ,
“That would have been suicidal,” commented Daniel Pennick,

_ the controversial Democratic chairman of the state-owned liquor

board in an interview. In the center of a heavilypublicized feud bet-

- ‘ween the governor and the LCB, Pennick has been critized fre-

quently by the Thornburgh adminstration as the cause of the ap-
propriations cuts. V
_ “Basically, we have taken our gloves off and we’ve been sparring
since,” said Nick DeBenedictus, a Thornburgh press aide,
acknowledging’ the move to unseat Pennick from his position with
the nomination of several replacements. . I -
But one day after a scathing attack of Pennick by Thornburgh at
a press conference, Pennick announced a different fiscal plan to

raise the necessaryrevenues to avoida cut _in appropriations.

On Proposed Merger

By MARY KANE
Pitt News Staff Writer ‘

A merger of the day school and.
night school undergraduate student
bodies is being planned by the Stu-

. dent Government Board, according
to SGB president Bill Abraham.
' However, the night school
cabinet of the College of General
Studies opposes the merger, which
cannot take place without CGS
consent, said CGS cabinet president
Tom Hajduk. _ .

“We are opposed because we
don’t believe a singleundergraduate
student government would be able
to represent the diverse interests of
the evening stuudents,” Hajduk
said. ' . ' _ ‘

But the CGS cabinet members are

“unsubstantially opposed” to the -

merger, according to'Abraham.
“They (the CGS’ cabinet

members) are opposed to it

themselves personally, but I don’t

know at‘ this point if they have the _

feeling of the night school student
to back that up,” Abraham said.
According to Abraham, the night

school students would be better.

served if there were one body,
because then CGS students would

be permitted to participate in Pitt '
Program Council programming and L ’

otherstudent organizations.
Abraham said the SGB plans to

determine how both day and night

students feel about a merger, and if

the SGB is convinced there should ’
only be one undergraduate body, A
‘they will take the proposal to the

administration.

“.If 6000Estudents preferred mak-
ing the move, and six CGS cabinet
members opposed it, then I would
feel comfortable taking it to the ad-
ministration,” Abraham said.

But CGS cabinet member Dave
Huffner believes the night school
body does not want a merger. "

University Likelyto Cut Funding for Pitt Women 's Center

By BOB WARMKESSEL
‘ Pitt News Staff Writer.

. Pitt’s Women’s Center, a univer-

sity support service for women in
the Pittsburgh community and
students at Pitt, will not be funded
by the university after June 30, 1981,
according to Cynthia Vanda, direc-
tor of the Women’s Center.

_ Vanda said that Assistant Pro-
vost Ray Steele informed her of the

funding cutoff during the last week
of July. Steelejhowever, said in an
interview Tuesday that the
Women’s Center could possibly be

funded again, but he admitted there *

would have to be “some extraor-

' dinary turnaround in funding from

the state” in order for the university
to provide money for the Women’s
Center in fiscal year 1982, which
begins- July 1, 1981.

According to Vanda, Steele prais-

, grams and its ability to ‘raise addi-

tional funds for the center when she
and Steele met in July. However,
Vanda said, he also delivered the

news that university funding of the V

center would endnext summer.

“He said there could be no more
funding because of the state fun-
ding crunch (affecting Pitt. and
other, state-related universities),”
the women’s center director said.
She added that she does not believe
finances are the only reason that the
center’s-funding will be cut. _

“We are a low priority in their
mind,” according to Vanda. She
noted that there is no mention of
women’s support services program-
ming». in the current university
capital funds campaign.

“Maybe since the majority of
undergraduate and graduate
students are women indicates they

porting women’s needs,” Vanda

said. “.But,.othe'r thanus, there's‘

no support service here which
creates a sense of a.woman’s regain-
ing of self-image.”
Assistant Provost Steele said
Tuesday that the Women’s Center
was not singled out‘ by the universi-
\ty as a program to be cut due to in-
sufficient state funding; he said

_ nearly all’ university’ departments

and programs have faced significant
cuts. ‘He added that there is “very
little‘ fat” within the university,
which forced the university to make
an evaluation of Pitt's total mis-
sion. 

“We had to look at the units on
campus that are most central to the
university’s mission,” Steele said.
“The Women’s Center is a special
place (in the university
Community), but if I have to make

Women’s Center is peripheral to
our central mission.” He stressed
that his evaluation of the1Women’s
Center is based strictly on monetary
considerations, ‘not on the perfor-
mance of Vanda or the Women’s
Center’s programs.’

Steele commented that Vanda
and her_Women’s Center staff can
prevent the Women’s Center from
closing next summer by inititating
their own fund raising efforts. He
added that his office has provided
Vanda with a list of foundations
that she could contact about secur-
ing money for the Women’s Center.
He said the foundations included in
his list could be contacted without
interfering with Pitt's capital funds
campaign.

“She can assure her own restora-

' tion,” Steele said.
Vanda said the Women’s Center

‘documentation concerning Pitt I
students who have been introduced

to the university via the Women’s

Center, she added that many,

women have used the center as a

preliminary step to enrolling. part- ' S

The Women’s Center budget fo ‘ ’
1980-81 is $47,000, an increase of .

-$4,000 over the 1979-80 budget.

This university money is used to pay
Vanda, a part-time secretary and

three work/study students. About _

$6,500 of the budget is used for
operating expenses, Vanda said.

fraternities have _more on their
minds right now than welcoming_
the freshman class to Fall rush-
specifically, how much longer
they'll be living in their University
-leased Bellefield Street houses. This
may very likely be until April '81, if
the university carries through with
= its plans to discontinue the frater-
nities’! occupance at these houses._
In a move that the fraternities see
as a threat to their existence on
Pitt's campus, the university in-
formed the fraternities of the “need
to be vigorous in the enforcement
of the saftey procedures,” in
reference to university owned pro-
perties. This fact, along with
others, have been communicated to
the fraternities through a series of
meetings with university ad-
minstrators and letters addressed to
the fraternity presidents. I
In a July 2, 1980 letter to the

« fraternity presidents from John

Vrana, assistant vice chancellor of
business and finance, the following
regulations were set forth by the
university for continued occupance
of‘ the houses by the fraternities:

——Noperson is to live or sleep in
the basement or on the third

floor of the house. _
—The number of students living
in the house should range from a
minimum of eight to a maximum
of 14. V
—Monthly rent from
September, 1980 through April
1981 will be $80 per student bas-
ed upon the occupancy they ad-
‘vise of between eight and 14
students. For example, if eight
students are living in the house
the monthly rent will be $640 (8
‘ x $80 per student). ,. S
——No’ less than once a month the
university will inspect the house
to review safety procedures, con-
‘ ditions, and number - of oc-
cupants. ' ‘
—The university will be respon-
sible for all normal mairitenance
and repair work. As in the past,
the fraternity is obligated to pay
for utilities directly. ’
—The lease from September‘,
1980 to April, 1981 ‘will be a
, month to month lease
cancellable by the fraternity at
any timewith two weeks notice
and cancellable by the university
if the above conditions are not
met or if conditions beyond the
.university’s ‘ control force the
university to vacate. »

But health and saftey concerns
are secondary to the fraternities at
this point as they wonder where

" their members will be moving in
April - if not sooner.
“Our primary objectives were

our concern for the health and‘

saftey conditions of the "properties
-which the fraternities rent from us,
and our own ability to be able to,
from the income we earn from
them, deal with the necessary
repairs that have to -be" made,”
Vrana explained in an interview,

citing recent fires in the Oakland -
area involving the members of the
university community. Vrana is in
charge of university properties and
residences.

Vrana explained _ that the units
which the two fraternities rent, at
214 and 220 N. Bellefield Street, are
single-family residences, “‘and
through time, the conditions of the
houses have aged, and the use of the
rental properties for multiple stu-
dent kind of use has presented a
serious concern to us.”

He denied that neighborhood
complaints of fraternities influenc-
ed the university’s decision to force
stricter occupancy measures upon

the two houses.

“I’m really not aware of much
concern in that specific area,” ,
Vrana said. '

But despite offers from the in-
dividual fraternities to buy their
own houses, Vrana explained that
the university probably won’t sell
except to a ‘ buyer who was in-
terested in using the houses “for
their original purposes,” or single
family dwelling. » '

“.1 think the fraternities would
have to ask themselves a really
legitimate question if they were in-
terested in buying a house like. that,
because if they were going to use it
for something other’ than it’s
original purpose, they would have
to seek the appropriate approvals.

And they would have to do the ap-
propuate types of work that would
be required to use it as fraternity
housing. Whether it’s possible or
not I don’t know, but I would think
somebody would want to be
cautiousabout even wanting to buy
something that might not be a
possibility for the purpose that they
want to use it for,” Vrana alleged.

Hence, questions are being asked
as to why the university never ob-
tained the proper dwelling re-
quirments from the city if they were

the owners of the houses in the first

place. . _ - _ _
“As I see it, the university IS not

providing _a suitable answer for a
future housing problem that has
built up because of neglect of their
own property,” said Eric Rader,
president of Delta ‘Phi Fraternity.
Rader confirmed his fraternity
was complying to the new occupan-
cy measures set ‘by the university,
but he said Pitt has not ‘performed
any maintenance on the house.
“Since my freshman year in 1977, I
have seen the university perform
only one improvement,“ Rader ad-
mitted, citing “two pieces of
spouting”'* as the single improve-
ment he has seen performed by the
university. -

However, The Pitt News has ob-.

tained a copy of a memo dated
December 175, 1977 from Myron
Skriabut, past assistant vice
chancellor of business and finance,
to Pi Kappa Alpha and Delta Phi in
which the University reaffirmed its
commitment to ‘_‘provide ‘you very
satisfactory living quarters at these
residences. ’ ’ ' ‘
“When we first spoke during the
month of August, 1977, officers of

both Pi Kappa Alpha and Delta Phi *

indicated they were disturbed by

This rumor was untrue" then and it is
untrue now. I can assure you that
the University presently has‘ no

tive houses other than your con-
tinued occupancy of them. In addi-
tion, I see no_ such plans in the im-
mediate future.

“It has been a pleasure working

Subsequently, in responding to

offered this explanation:

ly inconsistent with what we’re say-

New Assistant Director of

‘ Residence Life Brenda Zagorac is

glad to be back in the Steel City.
Having finished a -three-year stint
as assistant director of residence life
' at Shippensburgs State College,
Zagorac, a Pittsburgh native, has
found what she considers a dream
job in Pitt’s Office of Residence
Life (ORL).

“This job is more specialized into
my exact areas of study in college
(than her ~ position at
Shippensburg),” said Zagorac, who
holds a master’s degree in college
student personnel administration
from Indiana University—Bloom-
ington. “This -is exactly where I
want to be.”

As the name of Zagorac’s degree
implies, her duties at Pitt involve
the hiring and evaluation of resi-

dent assistants and resident direc-

tors. Slie conducted her first orien-
tation of new resident assistants at

Pitt last month_in an intensive five- .

day program.

“RA’s have a great deal of
knowledge,” said Zagorac. “They
are good sounding boards for
students; they know the system. On

"most subjects or problems, I think

the RA’s are directed. enough to
handle students’ concerns.” She

 

added that they also know about
other programs in the university,
such as counseling, to which they
can refer students with academic or
social problems. .

Zagorac, 26, was hired to fill the

' position left vacant when JoAnn

Woodson, then assistant director of
residence life, was named acting
director of residence life in the sum-
mer of 1979. Woodson, who has
since become the permanent direc-

 

 

._, -no

 

 

tor of ORL, replaced former ORL
director Fred . Fonseca, -who had
resigned. Tim Snyder is the other
assistant director of residence life.
Zaorac assumed her position at
ORL Aug. 1. She said she has been
busy since her first day on the job,
but she is not complaining.
“Anyone who_ gets into this job
realizes it’s not a 40-hour-a-week
job,” said _Z_agorac, noting that RA
sessions and freshman orientation

' ~ “But I sincerely wanted to be here —

the results of your work.”
Although Zagorac said that one , _
, of her main functions is keeping in 
touch with students via the.RA’s 7 ‘ . 2
and resident directors, she does not
want to isolate herself in her office.
“I want to keep the communica-

In _P_8gé 4-.—Friday, September 5, 1980 -

By SETH LUiiov1:

Pitt News Staff Writer ‘
In the first of this two part
series (see P.N. Vol. 75, No. 1)
we learned how Wesley Posvar
arrived at Pitt, his past history,
and the‘ condition _of the univer-
sity when he arrived. In addi-
tion, we were given a glimpse in-
to his daily life—- from the den-
tist’s chair to the board room.
Although’ making the switch
from educator and head of an
academic department to top ex-
ecutive officer - in a major
university might have seemed
slightly premature to outside "
observers, Posvar is entirely
confident that the move was ap-
propriate. While he was head of
the Social Sciences Division and
‘Political Science Department at
the Air Force Academy, Posvar
claims to have had authority
over. two hundred faculty
members, “a large number of
faculty under me than most
deans.” .

In addition, there was the adjust-
ment of having military personnel
under him to the independent

civilians under him, a "problem »
'Posvar!claims never to have en-
’ countered. ’

“There was no difference
because the people that I associated
with before were all academic peo-
ple in the military. They were all
highly individualistic and I had just
as many differences of opinion and
arguments then as I do now.”

When discussing his leadership
abilities, Posvar is very confident of
his natural talents and inclinations
in. management—so_mething he
claims cannot be taught.

“I believe I’ve had certain
management skills and financial ex-
perience,” Posvar boasted in an in-

“I understand corporate
planning and finance. 1 don’t think

that being a chief executive of _an I
- ‘organization is something that can

be taught anyhow. .

“‘You either do it through your
total capacities or following your
intuition and judgment, or you
You don’t just pick out

train him to be president of U.S.
Steel.’ You pick the person who is
best qualified.” I

One of the most salient features

of Wesley Posvar’s administration
has been the extent to which
responsibilities are delegated
amongst his subordinates. This

'- persistent necessity to delegate‘ is

what Posvar calls the “classic
dilemma - of delegation.” The
answer, he explained, has to be a
“combination of the respon-
sibilities he must control and those
he must delegate.

“I delegate to the extent that -I
must. It’s impossible to run a cor- ’
poration with 8,000 employees and
a budget of $250 million by trying
to do everything yourself. I have to

.have six« or eight principal vice

presidents or deputies. .
_ “But there’s a hierarchy in any —
organization and somebody has to

be responsible. Somebody has to
make decisions and be accountable
for success or failure.” _ '

Posvar will readily, admit that his
decision is final on all matters not
brought before the board of
trustees and, for this exact reason,

’ he often ‘encourages debate on the
' decisions he makes with his staff-

“I think building ’ consensus is
very ‘desirable. It’s‘ also very
desirable to have different points of
view. But the worst weakness in
here, and I want-to make this clear,
the worst weakness -an executive ad-
ministrator can have is a" yes-man. ’
Constructive criticism is a highly
regarded commodity, and it’s one I
seek from my staff. I recruit and
appoint the best people I can find

A and I want them always to tell me

exactly what they think.”

 

And if it’s not exactly what he
had in mind? .

“Then I take it very seriously.
Sometimes I make decisions against
the advice of my staff. The most
difficult decisions aretthose that in-
volve' moral issues, that involve
choices, both of which involve some
penalty—when there’s no right or
wrong way. If you’re deciding on a
tenure appointment which is con-
troversial or the recommendatibn
of a review panel or something, it
comes down in the last analysis to

‘one human being’s judgment. And .

 

then you’re alone with your cons-
cience.’.’ ‘

As the university has expanded,
Pitt has often been referred to as a
"corporate institution, an extremely
odious term to some , faculty
members and students who_ view
themselves as the victims of a cold,
mechanized institution buckling
under the weight of a self-
perpetuating bureaucracy, especial-
ly the upper-levels of the ‘ad-
ministration. Even Posvar has

referred to the university as a cor-_

poration, but only from the point
of view of the “management aspect
of things.” But he quickly» noted
that academic decisions are an area
"he rarely intrudes in, _and that

academic freedom. is alive and thriv-‘

ing at Pitt. N . -

it’s quite different. In academic
matters, I do not have authority
from the top down. I suggest,‘ I
guide, I lead, but I don ’t control.
Basic decisions are made by the
faculty. .-.the powerful unit in any
university ‘is the faculty organized
around a set of principles. And
their recommendation about _who
gets tenure and who doesn’t, about

who gets promoted, about what‘

their courses are going’, to be—is

.vital. I very, very seldom would
question that recommendation- or
the dean’s or anyone else. '

“Academic freedom is very safe
and secure at a place like this,”
Posvar asserted. _ _

And what is his deﬁnition of
academic freedom? ’

. .“An environmentin which free "

and open inquiry and expression of
views is completely uninhibited,
subject to the single? proviso that it
not interfere with the rights of ex-
pression of other people. And that
calls fora civil environment, that is,’
a peaceful environment. ‘Anyone
canexpress any opinion here, pro-
vided that we -maintain a situation
in which no _»one can -violate the
rights of "others through violence,
through seizure, through shouting,
through locking in or itvhatever. . .
that’s a violation‘ of academic
freedom.” .-

But Posvar’s concept of ' a

\ of free

 

peaceful environment has often
been _a fleeting "utopia, especially
when the widespread campus
discontent often came right to the
frontdoor of his‘ office, shaking
him into the reality that surrounded
him. Protests and teach-ins at Pitt
were quite‘ frequent at the height of
the Vietnam conflict, Kent State
deaths, and racial controversies.
And Posvar had enteredthe scene
at the worst time, often finding
himself caught in the middle o_f an
excruciating moral tug of war'—his
obligations to protecting the rights
speech and academic
freedom, and his obligation to the
‘community to assure order on his
campus. ‘ But Posvar weathered

those years, coming out of ‘them

a slightly scratched and a lot more

compromising, grateful that he was
able to witness the important
changes in the social and political
attitudes of his students.

“Walked 1.. The Door The Same
Day”

Posvar’s chief operating officer
and close associate is Jack B.
Freeman, senior vice chancellor for
administration. Posvar and

 

(-

Freeman have worked together for -

nearly twenty years, both in the Air
Force where Freeman served. as
assistant to the deputy under
secretary of the Air Force, and here
at Pitt where they “walked into the
doorrtlte same day.”

Freeman claims “ to know the
chancellor well enough that

on his own, confident that these
decisions reflect V Posvar’s judg-
ment. ‘ Except on matters of

next to Posvar, having gained more

responsibility since last summer"

when Posvar ‘removed two vice

chancellors andtwo directors from __
"his direct: control- and had them-
report to Freeman.  .

There is \a special conciliator _
working relationship ' between
Freeman and P/osvar, an ability to
evaluate each others’ decisions and
make effective suggestions in order
to arrive at a compromise or final
decision. _ Freeman said Posvar

“makes it very clear that he does not

But beyond their working
relationship, Freeman holds a deep

_ respect for Posvar, having worked

with Posvar longer than anyone else
at Pitt. ‘Freeman claimed to have
declined many offers to hold similar
highly placed ‘positions in other
ﬁelds. -

“I admire him,” Freeman said.
“He’s a man of high moral princi-
ple,_ he has great strength of
character and is dedicated to im-
proving the quality of this univer-

- sity. I’ve seen the growth and im-

provement and change in events

under his direction. His‘role has
changed over the years as is natural
in a situation of that kind. The
demands of the job have changed.
The university is twice the size it
was in 1967 when we arrived.

“But I have the utmost regard for
his judgment, for his dedication,
for his sensitivity, for his sense of

he has a view of the University and
he shares -that view widely. I think
m_ost people know what his

. ‘philosophy about a university is.

He allows the .people who operate
the institution, levels like the deans
and _the department chairmen, to do
their job. He wants certainly to
try. . .to assess what the social
what the students’
demands are for progress and
development.

The chancellor may compromise -

in terms of one program’ over
another but there are certain things
he -doesn’t compromise on. One is
quality. T

“If there is anything that is a
hallmark of his administration it is
the absolute commitment to main-
tain quality and improve the reputa-
tion and the standing, qualitatively,
of the University of Pittsburgh.
That’s very important because it

makes you, as a graduate of this.

university, more valuable. It makes

, your experience here.‘ better,

substantively and in terms of the
credential that you carry away from
this place. And that is something
upon which ~ he is absolutely
dedicated. ’ .

“Another very important con-

- _cern he has is the moral commit-
.ment of the university to provide

moral leadership to society. Long
before there were affirmative action
requirements, this university,
within a year of his arrival had laun-
ched a major affirmative action
program to open it up. This was
essentially a lily-white university in
1967. It was his sense of social
justice that led us to undertakea
variety of programs to open this
university up to blacks. To give
them opportunities not just as

' students but affirmative action pro-

grams to hire black faculty and
staff, to give senior administrative
responsibility to black ad-
ministrators. And that was his per-
sonal commitment, nobody forced

that on him.

“So he has a strong sense of mis-
sion, of what an urban research
public university ought to be all
about in the’ last third of this cen-

, tury. -And he works very, very hard

at selling that to the facultyand the
trustees and the general public, and
in "turning that commitment into
practice in terms of the ways and
the funds that get allocated and the
kinds of programs that get approv-
ed.

“He tries‘ to exercise leade_r- -
ship—which is after all what being a
university president is really all
about. It’s not just going out and
getting money, although that’s a big
part of it. It’s not just keeping the

he would, in the opinion -of most
people, be pleased. But not totally
pleased. In all he strives for, in all
he accomplishes, Posvar is never
fully satisfied with himself or his
performance. _ But it is this deep,
personal‘ obligation to perfection
that drives Posvar every day to
work at his maximum capacity in
making ‘Pitt’ a better institution.

His role as chancellor is constant-

_ly changing, the complexities of the

job grow tremendously each year he
is here.

books balanced, although that’s an
important partof it too. It’s setting
a direction forthe institution ‘and
making sure that, in all we do, we
try to be as consistent in moving the
institution in that direction.’.’
Into the Near Future

“All members of the University
community owe him gratitude for
these achievements. I, personally,
have the obligation not only to
preserve them, but to advance
them. For the basic character of
this university, so capably enhanced
by Edward Litchfield, is forward
momentum. ” -

(excerpt from Posvar’s March l 1, I968
memorial statement on the death
of Edward Litchfield.)

Were Wesley W. ‘Posvar to look
back on these words today and ex-
amine his career at Pitt to determine
his fulfillment of this cornmitment,

and legislators that theie tax dollars
are not put to waste, soliciting
funds from the local business com-

munity and recruiting distinguished _

faculty and students. And finally,
hemust plan for the future of the
University.

It is this aspect of his job, and
those under him, that affects every
judgment or decision Posvar and
his staff make. If money is spent on
a program» now, will there be
enough for other programs in the
future or will Pitt have to solicit
funds? What are the enrollment
projections like for the next five
years? «What is going to happen to
the availability of faculty and staff?
What kind of social and political
events will happen that affect
higher education in the near future?
And, indeed, .if Posvar were to

neglect this aspect of planning for’

the future in his role as chancellor,
P-itt would most likely lose its sense
of direction._

But what does Posvar do when he

witnesses a setback, a plan goes , -

backwards, or something goes
wrong? I »
“Hepicks himself up and dusts
himself off and’ moves ahead,” -
Freeman said. “How does any

-chief executive handle such things?

If you’re going to be chief executive
you have to accept the responsibili-
ty. One thing he never shirks is the
responsibility that rests in his office.
He has_ to make-. some very tough
decisions, decisions I’m glad I don’t
have to make. I have the advantage
that when I run into a very tough
decision, I— can buck it up to Wes
and say ‘look, gee boss,_I don’t
know. how to do this.’ But he —
doesn’t have anyone to buck that
decision onto, and ‘he doesn’t
hesitate to make tough decisions.

. “He’s been through good years
and bad years. We were together at
this institution when we were on our
‘growth plan; money was easy to
come by and it was a question of
asking, ‘gee dean, what do you real-
ly need this year?’ And if he wanted
it, you gave it to him.

“Now we’re in a very different
kind of ‘posture. Now our posture
is having earned the right to call this
university a great national and
international institution, one of
high quality. The question is: ‘how
‘do you keep it there, how do you
maintain quality in a ‘periodlin
which resources are becoming
harder and harder to get, inflation
is eating you alive, and there are
lots of different kinds of forces
operating within society?”

And the answers to" these and
other questions remain limitless,
sometimes inaecessable, but never-
theless there. . And if Wesley W.
Posvar were to say he never thought
about the solutions to these ques-
tions, he would be doing a great
disservice to-his institution.

“They (the night school students)
know when they're being ripped
off,” Huffner said. “They’re a lot
more intelligent than some of the
SGB member give them credit for.”

Also, Hajduk said he had been
told by Director of Student Ac-
tivities Andy Smith that it did not
look like it was possible to merge
without the consent of both student
governments.

“I did talk with Andy, and he
made a commitment to work for a
presidential board (a board con-
sisting of the president’s of Pitt's
three student governments) instead
of consolidating student govern-

" ments, Hajduk said.

“_If he’s made another commit-
ment to Bill Abraham in the mean-
time, then I’ll just have to get back
to Andy Smith about that.” _

Smith, however, said that he will
not take an official position on the
merger until a formal proposal is
made.

He added that technically, the ad-
ministration; can approve the
merger without the consent of the
CGS. However, Smith said the ad-
ministration would not do so if the
CGS cabinet remained opposed to a
merger. C '

Smith also said he supports the
idea of research and study into the
question of a possible merger.’

“Before there ., would be any

change, there would have to be a
considerable amount of rationale
for it,” Smith said. “I have a lot of
confidence that if the evening stu-
dent cabinet were faced with a set of
circumstances that indicated that
they should_ merge, they would do
it.” . ‘
Hajduk and Huffner believe the
idea for a merger came from Smith.

“I do know that Andy Smith
came from the Allegheny campus of
the Community College of
Allegheny County,” Hajduk said.
“He was not in favor of an evening
student government on that campus
and there" was not one.”

Smith denied the idea for the
merger was his.

ll’ 0 Termination otunwanted

* By MARY KANDRAY

On the ' first floor of" the
Cathedral of Learning are some ex-
traordinary classrooms, the Na-
tionality Classrooms. The brochure
for the classrooms states it simply:
“Unique in the world, the, Na-

‘ tionality classrooms are gifts to the

University of Pittsburgh from the

ethnic groups of Allegheny,

County.” The key word here is
gifts, and not just ordinary gifts,
but unique gifts.

.¢_ ;_l‘he Nationality Rooms are not.

just ‘rooms that ,are part of an
educational complex or rooms
donated by a wealthy trustee or
alumnus of the university; they are
special, rooms donated by ethnic
groups, meaning people...—working
people...immigrants and ancestors
of immigrants;..the roots. of Pitt-
sburgh.
It all started decades ago, in the
1930s, when John G. Bowman,
then chancellor of Pitt, dreamed of
a 500-feet-plus building that was
-scoffed at until the.people of Pitt-
sburgh began getting involved and
raising funds. Soon the building
that was impossible‘ became a reali-
ty.
Bowman, realizing that Pitt-
2,;-burghers, old and ’ new, had

 

 

something more to give to the
university, asked for more. Taken
from his book, Unofficial Notes, is
an excerpt from a speech "given to
Carnegie Steel workers and their
families that relates Bowman’s idea
of the Nationality rooms: '

“You ‘came to America not to
stay. You came to make money and
then‘ go home. But most of you are
not going home, you know. You
have come to stay. And your
children are growing up to become
citizensof the United States. Tell
me something. Are we to have a
better United States or a worse one
because you came? Did you bring
some ideas or ways of living that
will make a better United States? If
so, what did you bring?”

This was virtually «all that
Bowman needed to do to ignite the
interest and ‘enthusiasm of Pitt-

_ sburgh. Many of the immigrants

who had come to work in Pitt-
sburgh’s steel mills and coal mines
were homesick for their old coun-
tries, and tellingof “what they had
brought would bring them closer to
home.” 1

Things began moving. Bowman
enlisted the aid of Ruth Crawford
Mitchell, a sociology lecturer at the
university. She knew the Pitt-
sburghers and became their friend

lor herself.

rooms. Marble from the same rock

—Pitt’s Office_ of Veteran’s Ser-
vices has -an entirely new look with
the recent hiring of a coordinator of
‘» veteran’s services, a senior secretary

A ' Don Graffius, the newly hired
» A coordinator of veteran’s services,
has taken over an office that was
previously t ffed by two veteran’s

 

 

counselors, an administrative assis-
tant and_ 10 , veteran’s work/ study

counselors, Jeffry Parker and Lin-
da Ransom, resigned during the
summer, and the administrative
assistant position was _ eliminated
-because a grant that funded the
position was discontinued, accor-
ding to Al Bowen, director of
special student services._

The. restructuring of personnel in
the veteran’s services office has
placed Graffius in charge of the of-

secretary and Sue McCombs as

welcomed by the 750 veterans ser-

needs of veterans,” Bowen said.
Under the previous office setup,
where the two veteran’s counselors
performed both administrative and
day-to-day duties of the office,
there were some problems when
consensus was needed to carry out a
task, Bowen said. As a result, some
decisions were made with con-
siderable delay, which displeased
the veterans serviced by the office.

“Without knocking the previous.’

way of doing things, I think we will
be able to do -more for
veterans,”said Bowen. “We will

better serve veterans than we did in '

the past.”

In addition to Graffius, Grainger
and McCombs, four or five
veteran’s work/study students will
be employed by the officeto make
regular deliveries ‘ to the ' city's
Veterans Administration office, to
answer telephones and to conduct
peer counseling with fellow
veterans, Bowen said.

Bowen is impressed with the en-
thusiasm of ' Graffius, 39, who
assumed the- coordinator of
veteran’s services. position Aug. 8.

Graffius -previously served in a,

similar position at Community Col-
lege ~ of -Allegheny - County——Boyce
Campus.. - " _ .

. Although Graffius ‘said the-

number of veteransto be serviced at
Pitt ‘is about double that of the

community college, he is not awed
' by that fact. 7 e ' T '

“It isn’t so much the number of

A veterans that’s important; it’s the

accuracy and expediency of getting
things done for. them,” Graffius
said. However, he admitted the job

  -Recef’?fHirin9‘s ave... Veteran '5 Services New Look       

was a challenge because of the of-

_fice’s new setup.

“I didn't moveinto a ready-mad
job,” he said. -.
' Graffius said a primary goal fo
the veteran’s services office is max-
imizing efficiency sq that veterans

attending Pitt get certified “as easi- ..

lly as possible and in a timely man-

ner.” The office serves asa liaison
between Pitt and_ the Veterans Ad-
ministration so" that veterans on
campus receive the educational

funds to which they are entitled,

Graffius explained.

The office. also services widows
of veterans, dependents of veterans
and disabled veterans enrolled at
Pitt,” he  u

Graffius, a native of Vandergrift,
Armstrong County, served in the
Army from the ages of 17 to 24. He
was stationed at several posts in the

tal United States. Later he earned

At the present time, the universi-

that finding a new residence for the

“We don’t have any other kinds
of housing space for fraternities at

in the residence halls in terms of
special programs etc. , is_ really a stu-

said.

 added that the Women’s Center is V

Steele said that the Women’s

being sensitive“specifically to the

said that many ._.of the Women’s ’

gram as services that have also been

handled by the Women’s Center. _ A

“These services have always’ been

Steele admitted that.there is not a

that would cover women's issues in
the same‘ way as the Women’s

“ Tower C Fire Results In Limited Elevator Service

By COLLEEN McDONALD

7 Pitt News Staff Writer

Residents of Tower C have had to
adjust to limited elevator\service
due to a recent electrical fire in the
1'6-story residence hall’s elevator
machine room.

The fire, which extensively
damaged the control panels for the
middle elevator and all-of the inter-

connecting wiring for the other two .

elevators, was discovered around
noon, Aug. 24,.said D.J. Green, a
Westinghouse elevator ' technician
who is currently repairing ‘ the
elevators.- .
“Sixteen years in repairing

, elevators and I wouldn’t have the

faintest idea of\what caused it,”
said Green. .
Towers cafeteria workers were

Kﬁrst to report that they smelled

something burning, according to

Donovan_Hughes, director of hous-

ing. Hughes said the smoke was ,

released from vents in the elevator
machine room and went through
the air conditioning system down

into the cafeteria.

Also in the building at the time
were resident assistants, resident
directors and desk attendants who
'had moved into Tower C Aug. 23,
said Tim Snyder, assistant director
‘of residence life.

Peggy Romancheck, resident
director of Tower C, said she smell-
ed something early Sunday morn-
ing, about ten hours before the fire
was discovered. '

“I walked into my room around

2 a.m. Sunday, and I noticed that '
‘when I opened my door, something

smelled funny. . Not ‘ a burning
smell, though, so I didn’t suspect

anything,” said Romancheck, a
12th floor Tower C resident.

The smoke was not detected,by
the smoke alarms said John Costo,
a resident assistant living on the
16th floor.

“No fire alarm sounded,” said:
Costo. “l was in my room and
_some people knocked on my door.”
on my door.”

Costo hypothesized that the fire
started Saturday night; he said
“electrical fires burn very slowly.”

I Hughes, however, said that two
of the three elevators, No. 7 and
No. 9 are now running. ,

, “There are two service teams per
shift working 24 hours a day to
repair the damage,” said Hughes,
“but the technicians are claiming
that there are still some mechanical
ﬂukes in the two elevators that are
running.”

“Up until now there, have been
manual operators in the elevators,”
added Hughes. “Our hope tomor-
row (Friday) is to pull
operators off the elevators.”

In the meantime,‘ Tower C
residents await- the return of
elevator service".' Dave Neu, a 16th
floor resident, said the only in-
convenience for him so far has been
that the elevators shut off betwen

ll p.m. and 7 a.m.

‘‘I moved in (my room) in a space
of two days and I. haven’t had much
problems otherwise,” said Neu.

John Guaragno, a 15th floor resi-
dent, said he carried‘ half of his
belongings to his room by use of the
stairway.

Another 15th floor resident,

Michael Henna, who used the par-

those .

tial elevator service during check-in,
said “I waited one time a half-hour

‘ to 45 minutes for the elevator, but

there was a lot of cooperation on
the part cf everyone.”

' “People pretty much unders-
tand,” said Assistant Director of

Residence Life Tim_ Snyder “and -

Hughes estimated that the repair
work would take somewhere
around a month to complete and
that Westinghouse Elevator Com-
pany and the University have reach-
ed a tentative agreement about the
cost of the repairs. » ‘
‘ “It’s not definitive but the
estimated cost will be around the
- figure of $100,000. In the case that
more parts are needed, the cost
could rise,” Hughes said.

. Wednesday morning to start off the

school term in an apropos way. It
began reconstructing the past by
ordering an “eggs' and cheese

ed on a roll. As my teeth struggled
through the first few bites, it all

‘ began to come backto me and sum-

to await its reconstruction after the
winter term. School was definitely
back.

crawled, I drew a monster in my
notebook while an accounting pro-

’ length analysis of a...randomly

selected corporation’s 1979 yearly
report will constitute 30 percent of
my grade. My monster soon had a
victim with wing-tippedshoes and a

briefcase. To underscore the term
paper, the professor assigned two
chapters and five problems. The
victim became more mutilated. Five
minutes after class was officially

Life in la Chronosynclastic infundibulum

By NICK ARNEI‘_T

New dorm rules may‘ descend
from the heavens, or there might be
a draft. On the other hand, Pitt's
problems in the coming year might
be less earth-shaking, ’ but they’ll

undoubtedly be complex and con-

fusing. Some old problems are un-
doubtedly hanging around—after
all, there haven’t been any signifi-
cant of unusual changes made
around the University.

Fifth Avenue is torn up, as usual.
Deafening jackhamrners and Port
Authority buses still make conver-
-sation impossible. Cardiac Hill is
just as steep as it was in the spring,
Meter maids continue to scurry
aroundthe streets with the Com-
muter Bandit staying two steps
ahead. Somehow, it seems, on the
surface, thatlittle has changed.

There are a few differences. I
have a professor who failed to zip
his fly before coming to class. Curt
Graham is no longer Chief of
Police. Neither of those seems like-,
ly to have a severe impact on my

myself that Pitt wasn’t caught in a

Wesley seems to still command the
same ship. I guess that’s good...
but I wouldn’t mind seeing a few
changes. »~’

This newspaper could use a
facelift. . . hell, it could use a new
body -behind the face. There’s hope
for change. Perhaps some of you
who freely criticize will come and
help. Hey, I used to bad-mouth the

I still do,‘now and then.)

A good newspaper could change

will it make ‘the walk up Cardiac

other areas. ' . ‘ '

ing that the folks who can get
things done are somewhere in the
middle of the adminstration.

There’s probably a maintenance
supervisor who can -accomplish
more in a day than three_vice-

yell if you aren’t satisfied? Is
anybody satisfied?

You’d look silly yelling at the
Cathedral. Worse, they’d probably
take you to Western Psychiatric In-

hospital. If this should happen to
you, call your newspaper.

Does ‘your roo/f leak? Is your
phone dead? A campus cop giving
you a hard time? Did your room-’

increase in -Student Health Fee

Becomes Effective This Term

By NOLA WERNER
Pitt News Staff Writer
A $5 increase in the student
health fee will take effect Sept. 1,

‘ according to Gary Houston, ex-

ecutive assistant to the ‘ vice
chancellor for student affairs.

The increase, which raises the fee
from $16 to $21‘ a term, is the first
since 1976, when the Student Health
Service first became fee-supported,
Houston said. _ '

- “This will hold us, for about two
years,” said Houston. “It will be

1982 -or ’83 before another «increase
is needed.”

The student health fee, required_
of all full-time non-College of
General Studies students, covers
ambulatory and out-patient care in
general medicine and certain
specialty clinics.

Houston explained , that the _

specialty clinics are opened to meet
student needs for specific services.
“If there were a signiﬁcant in-
crease in the demand for a new ser-
vice then a clinic would be opened

for it,” said Houston."

’The specialty clinics presently
available are internal medicine,
gynecology," dermatology, minor
out-patient surgery and orthopedic
consultation.

The health service fee does not
apply to elective procedures,
emergency ‘room or hospital costs.
However, it does cover lab work,
immunizations and X-rays when

they are determined to be necessary

by health service staff, Houston
said. , ~ .
Pitt runs the health. service in
order to “augment the rest of the
Oakland,” according to Houston.

The clinic, also open to part-time
students on a cash basis, handled
46,000 patient visits from
September to April last year,
Houston said. ‘

Compared to other colleges in
this area, Pitt is giving “good com-
prehensive service,” he added.

The Wellness Resource Center is

the health education component

that is also funded by the health fee.
It offers family planning, programs
in cardiopulmonary resuscitation,
weight control, stress, exercise and

- . first aid.

The center also has organizations
like the Peer Health Educators and
the Peer lnfonnation: Sexuality
and Contraception‘ Education Ser-
vices, where students are trained to
counsel their fellow students.

The student health service
budget, approximately $500,000"
this year, is completely funded by
the student health fee. 2

“All themoney goes for student
health and nowhere else,” accor-
ding to Houston.

. All increases in the fee “are
recommended by the director of
health services on a cost basis. We
use the vehicle of the Student
Health Advisory Board, who are

representatives from student. .
government, to get back to the stu- _
dent constituency,”' Houston ex-,

General Assembly do not normally
react to funding for higher educa-

propose. ‘Rather, the process of

over many months.
work for the budget appropriations
should be closely followed by
everyone who presumes to have an

of the University are, in fact,
sincere in efforts to increase the ap-

 Fans Have 11-Game Wat to ‘Sweet’New Year

By JEFF DUROSKO
H Pitt News Sports Editor
_ Amid all ‘the excitement’ of a
number one pre-season rating by -

’ two of the most respected publica-

>'i“¢"’€'
l§i§\¥i.l.4L 5. A

 

tions in .the 'country,“The New

.York Times” and “Sports 11-

lustrated,” Pitt fans are gearing up

. for another championship _season

and booking ﬂights to New Orleans
for the first of the year. There is on-
ly one thing that Panther en-

thusiasts are forgetting—Pitt has 11

regular ‘season games to win before
any talk about a holiday trip can be
thrown around.

There are 11 games to win before
any talk of championship rings and
the MacArthur Bowl can begin; 11
games of keeping the Hugh ‘Greens,

Dan Marines and Randy McMil1ans '

healthy before a Pitt fan can yell
“We’re number one” and be sure.

And those eleven games won’t be
as easy as some people think. In
fact, the Pitt schedule includes two

- other teams in SI’s top 20, plus

Johnny Majors and the Vols of
Tennessee, and the traditional rival-

. West Virginia. ‘

Here is a brief season preview of
those 11 teams and this writer’s
predictions» of the outcome of those-
11 games.

Boston College Sept. 13 at Pitt

'~ Stadium _.

The. Eagles are Pitt’s first oppo-
nent andthe Panthers haven’t lost
to BC in the last six contests. Eagle
linebacker Jim Budness is a pre-
season all-America hopeful who
coach Ed Chlebek says “couldbe

» thelbest linebacker ever to play at

Boston ' -College.” However that
doesn’t say much considering the
football history at BC. The Pan-
thers should have little, if any, trou-
ble with the Eagles and should

~record an easy victory. Look for
’ Pitt to win by at least three
, touchdowns.

Kansasrsept. 20 at
Lawrence,Kansas
Pitt makes its first visit to Kansas
in , its third-ever meeting with the
Jayhawks. Last season, the Pan-

thers opened their year with a 24-0‘

whitewashing of the J ayhawks.
Kansas returns 48 letterman but on-
ly ll starters from a 3-8 team which

‘ ﬁnished in a tie for fifth place in the

Big Eight. Pitt should again do a

number on the "Hawks and win by_

14. - . ‘
Temple Sept. 27 at Pitt Stadium

The Temple Owls are well-known
as a team which can ‘give powers
and super-powers alike fits. The
Owls have played havoc with a
number one-rated Penn State team
and a powerful Pitt team ‘in the
past. Last year, despite running off
more offensive plays and gaining
more yardage than Pitt, Temple

was defeated by the Panthers‘ 10-9 .
when Mark Schubert hit a 46-yard .

field goal with less than four
minutes remaining in the game.

The Owlswere on.their way to --

their best season ever, winning ten’
games and losing only two (to Pitt
and Penn State). included in those
10 victories was a 28-17 defeat of

"the University of California in the

Garden State Bowl, giving Temple a
ranking of 17th in both the AP and
UPI polls. However, the Owls lost
13 starters and return 29 lettermen,
including split end Gerald Lucear
who led the nation in touchdown
receptions last season with 1
Look for Pitt to calm the Owls by at
least nine. -» V .
Maryland Oct. 4 at Pitt Stadium

By the Maryland game, Pitt
should be geared up and the players
ready to take on Godzilla.
Maryland may just be Pitt's God-
zilla, as the Terps are the feature
team on an otherwise less than ex-
citing home schedule. The Terps

Pitt News Staff Writer

Q What have you found to be
the major difference between col-
lege journalism and professional
journalism? Besides the resources
available, how about your attitude
as a pro, or your degree of motiva-
tion? ,

A) No, I learned an awful lot at
the Pitt News, it gave me an oppor-
tunity to do a lot of things," you
might say it’s play acting compared

. with the real thing, but there were

some things while I was there that I
pursued probably just as aggressive-'

<.{iI’« ly as Ipursue stories now. Obvious-

1y I know howto do it a lot. better,
but that was my first real experience
with thatkind of thing. But Ithink
I have similar attitudes now; to be
objective, honest, fair, to get" to the

bottom of thestory. I will say that .
. when I started, when I worked for

the Associated Press in Pittsburgh,
which I began doing in my senior
year, I learned a lot that helped me,
has helped me today. I mean it
wasn’ta question that I learned

‘everything I knew by the time I/left

Pitt, but you learn something all the
time I think.

I remember when I was s a
sophomore. I covered student
politics and nothing much had been
done with student politics at the
paper my previouus ‘year, _my
freshman year. And I guess I did
one story and then later the editor
said do some more or that's your
beat or I asked for it—whatever it
was, I was interested in politics. I
made something out of it to the
point where at the height‘ of the
election I was doing one big story
an issue, we published twice a week

then. And I made something big .

out of it and it wo1dn’t have been

there if I hadn’t covered it that way, '

but that's sort of the way I started.
If it’s worth doing I’ll make the best
out_of it.
Q( How valuable was the ex-
perience of being a college jour-
nalist in helping you in professional
journalism? '
A) Tremendously valuable. To_
the point that if anyone asks me to-
day, somebody going to college,

' that wants to go into the newspaper

business, if he should major in jour-
nalism or what should he do, I

recommend against majoring in

" majored in journalism.

journalism. Because that was the
advice I received a long time ago
and it turned out to be good advice."
Major in some area that you’re in-
terested in and get as much ex-
perience as you can on the school
paper. My experience on The Pitt
News was invaluable.

. Q So what do you think about_a

‘ journalism school or a journalism -

major as opposed to practical ex-
perience? ‘ .
A) — You can’t learn anything-
about the newspaper business sit-'
ting _in a classroom. Whenl was at
Pitt they had 7a couple of journalism A
courses and I took a reporting
course...
' Q) Butrthey never had a major
here? - V _ - ‘ -
A) No. The courses they had—I
don’t know if they were typical of a ’
good journalism, course because ‘I

~ never had any experience anywhere

else, but I didn't learn anything. I ,
learned an awful lot about reporit-
ng,‘ wri_ting, _ layout,
m'akeup—everything. I especially

’ enjoyed, but I haven't done it for

twenty years since I left there, but I
enjoyed laying out the pages. It
gave me a chance to do something a.
little creative that I’d never done
before. I could not have asked for a
better, in effect, beginning‘ in the
business. I just think that" even
though we published twice a week
as opposed to some college papers
publishing five days a week—it was
a great experience and it helped me
an awful lot; v

Q_ Do you think that since Pitt
didn't have a joumalism major,
you_ were kind of compensating for
it by working at the Pitt News? I
_ A) No, I would not have ma-
jored in journalism. When I was in
my senior year of high school, I
talked to a man who was then a
reporter at the Post Gazette who
was editorrof the Jewish Chronicle,
A1iBlum, who advised me to major
in something else and get all the ex-
perience I could in newspaper work.
In fact, I. was interested in political
science. and even if there had been a
journalism major I would not have
I might
have taken more courses, but I
think that always, I laugh about it
now, at the time I’m not sure—I got
a B in a reporting course._ I always

' say that B kept me from graduating -

day.

Q How have you achieved the
position you ’re at today? Do you

attribute it to your perserverance ,

or to your dedication? _

A) First of all_you have to have
talent. .I think the newspaper
business is one area where
somebody can’t get something for
you. Somebody might open a door
for you, or get you a job, but you
have to produce to keep it. I've

‘always been very aggressive, _very

dedicated kind of reporter. I’ll
spend hours on the telephone track-
ing down a story, and that's impor-
tant. You have to work at the job.

You can’t sit back and wait for
things to come to you, you can’t
loaf and expect to do a good job.

Q So you think it ’s a mixture of
talent and hard work?

A) Oh yes. Some people get by’
talent alone, _but I think after a
while it begins to show and it
becomes superficial.

Q Why did you go into sports?

A) I've always enjoyed sports,
playing and seeing and covering.
And originally when I started work-
ing for the AP in Pittsburgh I was

- just a general assignment kind of

person, sports included.» But

* because - Pittsburgh is a major

league sports town I got to do a lot
of sports and the AP sports depart-
ment in New York was looking for
somebody to bring_to New York to
do baseball, and they called me and
I went. ' '
I was a little reluctant at the_ time
to specialize in sports, because I en-
joyed the variety I was doing in Pit-
tsburgh, but I ﬁgured that was a
way to get to New York and I felt it
was important -I do that because
New York was a focal point of the
communications business. And so I
got into sports,.I was in the sports
department of the AP from the end
of 1963 to through July of 1969
when I went to the Times. And
here again, the Times offered me a
job on the sports: department. At

- this point I guess it’s a very comfor-

table thing. I mean there are times
when I would like to do something
else, but it’s become something that
I’ve gotten into and I’ll probably
continue.

Q —What. does the New York
Times usually look for in a writer?
Do they look for experience?

A) » Yes, experience, accuracy,
again talent, capability of covering
a story. . _

Q So it« doesn’t matter if

someone ’s a.Harvard graduate as -

opposed to a Slippery Rock State
graduate? ,

A) I don’t think ‘so. I don’t
know about outside sports, I don’t
know what they look for. I know
within the sports department it’s
more the person and what he can do
than his background as far as where
he went to school. The people who
are on our sports staff who have

been hired recently, I can’t even tell
you where they went to school.

I sat at the table almost directly in

Khrushchev was sitting. And it was
just a very unusual experience. He

By ANNA ARLOTTA
Pitt News Sports Writer ‘

When the Pitt soccer team travels
to Akron tomorrow afternoon, the
Panthers will be seeking revenge
over the Zips for the loss of a year

‘ ago.. Last s_eason’s home opener
found the Panthers tasting bitter
defeat ‘ in the final eight seconds
when Akron cut through the Pan-
ther defense and successfully placed
the ball into the net to record a 1-0
victory.

_The year prior to that Pitt was
defeated in the same opener against
Akron in a hard fought 3-2 contest.

V .' Now Panthers will try to switch

hands and be the spoiler at the Zips
opening game.

_ -Pitt has come back to erase its
5-8-2 record of the past season and

A A will work toward making some ma-

‘jor improvments for the upcoming
year. »

Many of those improvements will
center around goal scoring. Pitt, in

3 15 games last season scored only 12
goals. The returning scoring leader
is sophomore wing Eric Tiedtke.
The problem is that his high scoring
number was two.

What the—Panthers hope to see
this time around islnot only more
goals from the foot of Tiedtke, but
also "more. scoring from a whole
crop of returning lettermen and
recruits. _ _ ~ ' '

In the four exhibition games that
the Panthers have played in the past
‘two weeks, Tiedtke has already
‘scored twice as has sophomore wing
John Pizzella. The team now is
beginning to gel on the front line all
the way back to goal where junior
Scott Thunberg will be guarding the
nets against the Zips.

Pitt opened up’ its exhibition
schedules in a contest with a local
Keystone League team—the Pitts-
burgh Soccer Club. The ‘Panthers

.were defeated 1-0. That game was
followed by another defeat to a
tough West ‘Virginia Wesleyan
squad by the score of 2-0. Success
started coming Pitt’s way Monday

rseason 

a

I.
‘l

evening when the Panthers were vic-
torious over Geneva College 3-0.
Here Pizzella scored twice with
assists to Bob Hughes and Al
Adelmann. The third mark came
when fullback Jim Hackworth took
an indirect kick that deflected off a
defender’s foot before being put in
the goal by freshman midfielder
Chris Richmond. 'In a mini game
that followed, Pitt's Gerry Wassen
powered a shot from the ‘40-yard
line‘*t_hat caught the Geneva goal
keeper off guard and became
another Pitt score.

Wednesday night the Panthers
hosted the annual Alumni game and
found. another victory 3-1.
Tiedtke’s two goals were followed
by a spectacular shot from the right
wing side by junior Al Adelmann.

_“We have to make sure that our
midfielders are scoring too,’_’ said
Bemis. “By looking at Al’s
(Adelmann) goal against the alumni

we can see that he will become a big_

scoring threat for the season.”
Defensively the Panthers are in
the process of filling the spots made
vacant by graduaton. Sweeperback
Tom Livenguth and stopper Jerry
Tomasetti are no bnger in the

defense to fill the holes‘ and stop the ‘

opposing offense.

In their position should be
freshman Don Bowmen at sweeper
and sophomore Tom Trempus at
stopper. Trempus was a starting
midfielder as a freshman last
season. The problem now_ is that
both Bowen and Trempus have
been under the weather due to the
flu. The probability of their return
for the Akron contest is unknown.

And, if they do return, the chance’

of the two playing up to par may be
questionable. Bemis has been swit-
ching people . around to see just
what combination will be the best to
make up the middle of the defensive
line. Freshmen, Rich Rebholtz and

' Scott Norton or sophomore Mike
Hrynko may be.ca1led on to do the

job. Sophomore Karl Heimbach

go places that other students can’t.

You have doors open to you that
other people don’t. I remember be-
ing on a student board that met
periodically with the chancellor,
who at the time was Edward Lit-
chfield. And I got to like him very
much. I wassvery impressed with
him, and I always resented what

happened to him at Pitt and in Pitt-
sburgh. He was a man who was try-
ing to upgrade the standards at Pitt.
Pitt was a really mediocre, lessthan

mediocre school, and he tried to
A upgrade the standards. He _rufﬂed

some people, and theythink they
got their revenge or whatever.‘ But I
just think being able to know him

and doing things like going to the '

you lots of opportunities.

I remember in the fall of "1959

when John Kennedy, the senator,
just started to run for the presiden-
cy, for the nomination. He "came to
Pitt and I remember-there was a
transit strike and he was having a
press conference at the Hilton

‘downtown, and I went down and
- covered that. And then somehow

got myself a ride with him to Pitt.
So I went up to his room while he
did some interviews, and then rode
up to Pitt with him, Pierre Salinger,
and Ken O’Donnel. I remember he
was knowledgeable of t-he Pitt foot-
ball team, but of course he was
prepped on that ‘before he came.
But it was interesting because Pitt
football at that time was not very
good. '

But that's another memorable ex- ’ /

pearience. These are things as a stu-
dent that I was able to do because I
was on the Pitt News.

Q)- What do you think your most ‘

‘the . 
“ appearance.

_ Q) What was the style of news at ,

memorable experience was at
Pitt News?

,A) The Kennedy thing probably 5 
even more than the Khrushchev
because of the fact that I was able}; 
with;-“ ;
him. ~ ‘ ii

to ride from the Hilton to Pitt

I also remember when I was  I_
cused of being responsible for hang-1' i

ing Johnny Michale Oatson in ef-S

figy. I didn’t know anything about

it until somebody woke me up 8 '

a.m. after I had been uptill four in
the morning on deadline night, and
at 8 was awakened by one of our .
photographers that Michale
Oakson had been hanged in effi1y
and he took a picture. That was; a

Tuesday morning and I" figured
we’d get it in on Wednesday’s
paper. ‘

I guess if I had to pick out one
single thing off the top of my head,
it would probably be the Kennedy

the time, did" you considerit just
basic informative information for
the Pitt community or did you put

in_- investigative stories or accuse,

people of things?

A) I certainly looked at it more
than just a newsletter, or an infor-
mation sheet for the Pitt communi-
ty. ‘ - -
.The administration didn’t like
me. A member of the administra-
mm didn’t-care too ‘much for me. I
did a column once which was made
worse by the fact that the printer
mis-read the head size and it came

writing  

out a 48 point head headline, and I
think it was supposed to get twenty

four, about academic freedom, or I i

forget what. I did some things that

stirred some people up. And ‘those

were tame’ years, -that was before
» the sixties. . -

I would like to think we were an
agressive newspaper -before its time.
I don't want to exaggerate that, but
I do think we did‘some«thir"1gs that
were out of the ordinary, not
enough probably, but within limits
of what we had in staff and person-
nel. ‘

And thensvhen I was ajunior and H

the natural i.n line to become editor,
there were a couple people who

tried to prevent me from becoming.
, editor because I was considered too

outspoken. ,They were trying to
stop me from becoming editor.
They didn’t succeed. .

-the Pant/her football squad as they
face an always tough arch-rival in
-West Virginia. Although Pitt has

- won the last four consecutive con-

,» tests, the Panthers were pushed in

‘ one of the 24 starters from the 1979

Tennessee Oct. 25 at Knoxville,
Tennessee
In the storybook game of the
season, student meets teacher.
_Jackie Sherrill was an assistant to
Johnny Majors while Majors was at
Pitt and now, the two will meet
head to head, team to team on the
field. Just four years ago, Majors
was prepping his team for what
would become a national cham-
pionship yearfor the Pitt Panthers.
Majors was called home to Ten-
nessee to begin a new winning tradi-
tion there following that season.
‘Pitt and Tennessee have never
“met, but "this game could prove to

—be a pivotal one for both teams.

Forty-four lettermanand ll starters
return from a 7-5 team which lost in
the Bluebonnet Bowl to Purdue in
Majors’ ﬁrst winning season at
Tennessee.

This could be Pitt’s biggest and
most emotional game of the season
in a stadium which seats 90,150, se-

‘cond only to Michigan’s home
field." Despite the Major’s mysti-
que, ‘huge crowd and general
strange aura which surrounds the
game, look for Pitt to win by 10.
Sorry J ohn'ny.

. Syracuse Nov. 1 at Syracuse, New.

I York

Although Pitt has won seven con-
secutive times against the
Orangemen, Syracuse has been one

' of the biggest headaches on Pitt’s
schedule for years. In the last four
years, Panther‘ squads have won by

~ scores of 28-21, 18-17, 28-20 anti
23-13 in 1976, the year of the na-
tional championship. That was
Pitt’s second closest game of that
undefeated season. Coach Frank
Maloney has
.termen, including 14" starters; seven
each on offense and defense. But,
the Orange are missing one man
which will hurt them. He is quarter-
back Bob Hurley who played games

35 returning -let-l

 

 

‘ .

with otherwise solid-as-a-rock Pitt
defense. Therefore, Pitt will win by
at least 14.
Louisville Nov. 8 at Pitt Stadium
Louisville looks like a breather
after the’ kind of schedule the Pan-
thers will be playing prior to this
game. The only other meeting bet-
ween the two schools was in 1976
when the Panthers recorded a 27-6
victory. The Cardinals have only
12 starters returning from a 4-6-1
team. Look for an easy Pitt win by

ArmylNov. 15 at West Point, New
York . . '

I

The Panthers 40-0_’ victory over
Army last year was the most
thorough pounding of any team last
year. There are 14 starters return-
ing from a 2-8-1 team which played
consistently bad after the -third
game of the season. There is not
much hope for a better showing by
the Cadets this year. Pitt will win
by at least 20. '

Hi'ghExp

Penn State Nov. 28' at University.

Park - .

What more can be said about the
Penn State game. -The Lions are
always Pitt’s toughest opponent as
Pitt is the same to State. No other
rivalry surpasses that which exists
between the two schools. It’s USC-
UCLA, Nebraska-Oklahoma and
Alabama-Auburn all rolled into
one—at least for the average Pitt
or Penn State fan.

timitstic about the upcoming
volleyball season. Take a look at

this year’s squad and at Pitt’s per-_

formance the last two years and it is
obvious.

Pitt’s “winning women” have

won the Eastern Regionals for the.

last two years and last season they
finished l3th_ in the Association-for
Inter-Collegiate Athletics for
Women with Pitt being the number
one team in the East in 1978 and

' 1979, Collier finds himself in charge

of , what he calls, “ the team to beat
in the east.”

All-American in 1977 at Ohio
State, Collier previously held the
assistant coaching jobs at the
University of Pacific and‘ at ‘his
alma mater, Ohio State. Now with
Pitt, Collier has a great deal of
talent to work with.

One’very talented Panther return-
ing to the lineup is senior Maria

acts as the quarterback of the team

Collier also has three outstanding

C

Pennick’s proposal to be an-
nounced and implemented at a
Sept. 17 press conference, would in-
crease the prices on low-cost wines
and liquor and lower prices on the
expensive items to increase the
volumes of goods sold.

According to Pennick, the plan is
not a compromise with the Thom-
burgh adrninstration.

“It is just a better way of doing
business,,to be competitive with the

'‘‘%.‘''-adjoining states,” Pennwick said,

“and also to meet our budgetary
obligations.” '
DeBenedictus gave the Thorn-

_ burgh adminstrationts view of the

plan.

“Our bottom line is that if the
plan will allow the Liquor Control
Board to live up to its earlier com-
mitments of $212 million in
revenues and taxes then they’re the
pricing experts,‘ we are in no way li-
quor pricing experts—that’s . fine
with us. But the plan is their_plan
and they'll have to implement it and

— "answer any questions to it.” ~

But there has also been a good
deal of criticism leveled at Thorn-

"iv burgh,‘ particulary from State

Auditor General Al Benedict, who
accused Thornburgh of improperly
reserving $50 million that could
have been. directed into the ap-
propriations.

the auditor general’s office con-
firmed that the governor and his

0 budget office had encumbered near-

ly $555 million from the fiscal’ year
which ended on June 30, 1980. The
encumbering of money is a book-
keeping technique to reserve money

for payment of bills that become '

due after the close of the fiscal year
in which they were incurred.
According to most accounting.
standards, encumbering. of money
is a legitimate and necessary pro-

cedure. But occasionally, a gover- ’

nor will attempt to encumber more
funds than are actually necessary.
Excessive encumbrances quickly
create a cash surplus which the

governor may designate for any _

purpose or program he so desires.
The auditor general’s office
estimated that Thornburgh has at-
tained a $50 million surplus by over-.
encumbering monies from the prior
fiscal year. But the legislature can-
not reappropriate the $50 million
until the governor ' directs the
various state agencies to lapse all ex-
cess encumbrances and uncommit-

ted funds.
“If Gov. Thornburgh were really

concerned with finding a solution to
the nonpreferred appropriation
dilemma, he could immediately
direct the state departments to lapse
all excess encumbrances and un-
committed funds. These funds

propriation by the state

legislature,” Benedict said in a-

statement. ,

DeBenedictus said the accusation
by Benedict that the governor was
improperly holding funds was
“blatantly false.” . I

DeBenedictus explained‘ that the
adminstration‘ was going to use a
“pay-as-you-go system.”

“We wanted to make sure the
money was there when contractors
forwarded their bills,” he said.

“Basically, it’s good accounting_

practice.”

Although encumbrances were
lower during the ’Shapp..adminstra-
tion, there were higher deficits in-
curred, DeBenedictus said.

“If we have a deficit, it. pays you
to keep a lower encumbrance rate,
because that way you're hiding
some of your deficits. If you en-
cumber more, your deﬁcit will be
higher. . ' ..

“I think we did some ofwhat
Benedict is saying, but in a much

more responsible manner,”

DeBenedictus added. ,

Recovery of the $33 million
shortfall through increased license
fees will be debated in the General
Assembly when they return from a
recess Sept. 15, and Pennick has in-
dicated that the LCB plans to im-
plement their new pricing plan later
in September. ‘

By WALTER R. WATSON
Pitt News Staff Writer

In an exclusive interview,
Mark McKinnon, editor of the
University of Texas student
newspaper, The Daily Texan,
offered some views concerning

his recent jailing for refusing to _

give an Austin judge unpublish-
ed photo negatives taken at a
Jan. 31 lecture inwhich 16 Mid-
dle East students, some Iranian
‘were charged with disorderly
conduct. '

‘ ‘First, ’ ’ said\tl1e' 25-year-old
Denver liberal artsxrnajor, “they
weren’t just Irania'ns on trial.
There were students from other
Middle Eastern countries
demonstrating as well. ' The
speaker was Fereydoun
Hoveyda—-he used to work as
chief_ delegate for Iran in the
United Nations. The protesters
were shouting and upset because

' Hoveyda was claiming that he

was speaking for the Iranian
government, when they were
saying that he had never been to

Iran,” McKinnon said.

McKinnon was placed in jail

; Tuesday .for refusing to give

County Court Judge Jon Wisser
negatives of pictures taken by
The Daily Texan photographers
of the demonstration. He was
released on $1000 bond pending
a hearing on a habeas corpus
petition alleging that Judge
Wisser violated the free press
provision of the Constitution by
jailing McKinnon. Today,

District Court Judge Pete Lowry
reduced McKnnon’s charges,
since 12 of the 16 defendants in
the disorderly contuct trial were
convicted without use 0 the stu-

dent newspaper's photo'A
negatives.
“The sentence ' was

withdrawn. . .because it was a
moot issue,” said McKinnon.

‘(There was not need, in other
words, to keep me in jail,
because a verdict had already
been rendered in the case. You
know, every case signiﬁcantly
affects our first amendment
rights of free press. \It’s only
been in the past few years that

A there’s been a slowdown on the

chipping away of press

_ privileges.” —
“It could have been a lot

worse,”added McKinnon, “like

“over at The Stanford Daily”.

McKinnon was referring to the

case in which Stanford Universi— .
. ty’s newspaper was searched and
seized without a subpoena for a

materials concerning a case’ for
local prosecution officials.

“We ’ were real concerned
about thatdecision, as we were
ours. I'm glad it’s over, to tell
you the truth, and I'm glad we
kept our negatives.”

“I think things are getting a
little better in the l980’s, from
just two years ago, and I'm ‘hop-

ing thatwhat we're seeing is a ~

new trend leaning toward better
consideration of news organiza-
tions.” '

There won’t be any more apples,

' _ grapes, oranges or pears in the base-

ment of the student union this fall.
The student run ‘food
co-op,which has been plagued with
financial problems;has been shut
down and will be re-evaluated, ac- '

. cording to food co-op chairman

Susan Sendler.
Formerly located in the basement
of the student union, the food co-

 

ment business office, concerning
how $6000 allocated to the co-op‘
was to be used, according to SGB
president Bill Abraham.

The food co-op and the SGB
believed the $6000 was ‘needed as a
security deposit to cover possible
defaults, and was "to be left un-‘
touched, Abraham said. However,
the student government business of-
fice had been using the $6000 in a
different way. I
“The business office thought the

.l-. '~   :’~':‘—W

$6000 was to be used to cover ven-

_ dor’s bills,” Abraham explained.

The co-op accumulated an $8000
deficit last year, according to
Abraham, and during the summer,
SGB voted to close it._But closing
down the co-op for re-evaluation is
an “historical trend,” according to
SGB member Walter Burke, who
has been working with ‘Abraham
and Sendler. ‘

“We’re looking at it now; we're
not sure what went wrong,” Burke

 

.>'

said “It (the co-op) will re-open
when it is in a stable position.”
Sendler said the co-op will

_“definitely‘ reopen” whenever the

committee forms a budget ‘and pro-
posal and brings it to the board.
Where the co-op will reopen is a
question bringing varied responses.
“I don?t think it is (the student
union) the best location for the
food‘ co-op,”
“We’ve been kicking around some
ideas , like trying to give the co-op

Abraham said. -

    

more visibility.”

.Burke said the former location of ‘ ‘

the co-op “is not acceptable to
most people. , _
“But I don’t know if getting

. I morepeople is the answer,”‘ Burke
said. Then it just gets more com-

plicated.” .

Sendler believes the student
union is the best location for the co-
op, and agrees with Burke that

more visibility might cause com- -

plications.

“The co-op was getting too big
for itself,” explained Sendler. “We
(the committee) had some
misunderstandings on how the
financial end is run.” .

The Student Government Board
(SGB) decided to to have a student
from’ the Graduate School of

acording to,.Sendler.

“We all decided it was important

Many_ of the co-op’s difficulties
resulted from a ‘misunderstanding

By JANE I-IOLAHAN .
4 Pitt News Staff Writer
As -Pitt- enters into the 1980’s, few of the idealistic programs born out of
the campus unrest of the l960"s still exist butone. .

'0

Begun in 1968, the Office of University-Community Educational Pro- - A

- grams (U-CEP) is still going strong in 1980.

There was‘ a demand at Pitt in the late l960’s for increased minority
enrollment on campus. “U-CEP,” according to Gail Austin, a counselor
who has been involved with U-CEP since its inception, “represents to an
extent a response to that demand.” ’ ' , - »

The admissions program at P.itt, due to the large numbers involved, can-

~ not look beyond SAT scores and class rank.‘ U-CEP was designed to look

beyond these statistics" and find students on the borderline. Students who
would succeed at Pitt, even if their SAT scores said they wouldn’t.,
Motivation is the major factor in choosing students to be part of U-CEP.
Besides looking at SAT scores and class rank, written self evaluations and
recommendations from high school counselors are also reviewed.
About 90 percent of the 250 students enrolled in‘:.U-CEP come from large

urban high schools, where their education may have faltered, according to 
. _ Austin.

“High schools are remiss in their responsibility to educate_ all their
s_tu_dents,” Austin alleged. _

Therefore, a student may rank in the top 10 percent of his class, but still
get low SAT scores and not be admitted to Pitt. The high school has failed
to challenge him enough,-according to Austin". .

.“The program is designed for students who under prevailing admission
criteria would not be accepted to the University of Pittsburgh,” she said.

Once accepted through the U-CEP program, students are required in
their‘ first two years to take 21 credits in U-CEP courses. Austin stresses
that these are not remedial courses. - ‘ '

“Our students are ‘suffering from the same kind of ills a lot of other
students’ are suffering from,” Austin said. » ‘

"All U-CEP ~ classes have a counterpart in the College of Arts and
Sciences. The difference is that U-CEP classes are smaller and there is
more intense counseling for students during their first year.

“The faculty has expertise in teaching our type of student,” Austin said.
U-CEP has intentionally remained small to maintain a close relatinship
with its students. When it began there were only three employees and 50
students, and today there are 250 students and 25 to 35 employees. So
while it has ‘grown it still remains small enough to keep in personal contact
with its students. , _ , '

V The U-CEP program does not deal with financial matters. Students look
for financial aid in the same places other CAS students do.

“We are not a financial aid program. Students are chosen purely on
academic backround, not economic background,” Austin explained.

Students come from all over the country, but Philadelphia has the largest
‘enrollment, with Pittsburghcoming in second. Over 2600 students have
been admitted through U-CEP ‘over the past twelve years.

After their first two years in _U-CEP,courses, students take all CAS ’

courses. U-CEP involves only their first two years. No mention is made of
the program in their transcripts. » .

“There are some students who are admitted to CAS and request to be
reconsidered for U-CEP,” Austin said. “Theyféel they need extra support
they would not normally receive.” v A '

The success rate of the U-CEP student compares with the national
average, and some have gone on to get master’s degrees and Ph.D’s and

I some have become doctors. These are people who under normal conditions

' would not even have been admitted to Pitt.

One real-world lesson you’ll learn in
school is the importance of productiv-

part of the problem is time you can’t
spend learning concepts.

A Texas Instruments professional

time more productive. And it can also
help you move into the world of a pro-
fessional. A world where knowing the
concept is only part of the solution.
Bringing out the answer requires a
working knowledge of a powerful
personal calculator.
