 Pitt Urges Appropriation Hike

BY BILL MOORE

HARRISBURG—Chancellor Wes-
ley Posvar yesterday urged memb-
bers of the Senate Appropriations
Committee to increase the amount
of money allocated to Pitt above the
$61.9‘ million recommended by
Governor Milton Shapp.

Posvar told the legislators Pitt
was a “sound investment” and
warned that if the University's
appropriation was not adequately
increased, the quality of‘ education
could suffer. He also stressed that a
further hike in tuition could
jeopardize the ability of low-income
students to attend Pitt.

Last month Shapp recommended

a minimal $1.5 million‘ increase in ,

Pitt’s state funding, after Pitt
officials had asked for a $9.1 million
increase.

The senate committee, along with
members of the state house, have
the option of increasing Pitt"s
funding, but such an increase would
necessitate a further tax hike, the

’ legislators said.

Q)

“We think we'are a tremendous
public investment,” Posvar said in
his appeal for funds. “We produce
the doctors, the lawyers, the
engineers and the industrial leaders
the state needs.” '

Posvar also stressed the impor-
tance of Pitt as a research, center
and as Pittsburgh’s largest employ-
er. .
“In three years, from 1972_ to
1975, in constant dollars, the tuition

ROTC Students Renew
Accreditation Drive

BY PETE DICKS

Pitt Air Force and Army ROTC
students began circulating student-
initiated petitions on campus this
week in a renewed effort to obtain
ROTC course accreditation for those
members enrolled in the College of
Arts and Sciences. .

Both branches of ROTC hope
5,000 students will sign the
petitions which are to be presented

at the Student Government's next.

meeting.

“The petition is wholly a student
effort; all we expect them (SGB) to
do is send a recommendation to the
Faculty of Arts and Sciences
committee on ROTC, supporting
the return of credit to ROTC,"
stated Jim Painter, a senior Air
Force ROTC student who is
spearheading the petition drive.

' “We're trying to give Student

_. Go_vernment.something to fall back

on, with three or four thousand
signatures saying, ‘Yes,
students are -for the credits or at
least they're not opposed to it,‘ "
Painter said.

ROTC lost its CAS accreditation
on‘December 3, 1968, as a result of
an FAS vote at the height of the
Vietnam War controversy. Efforts
to renew accreditation since 1968
have failed, most recently on April
14, 1975, when FAS voted 84-74
against allowing students to apply
ROTC credits to the 12 non-CAS
credit limitation.

Painter feels that Vietnam
sentiments should e no longer
control the issue: “We're not
bringing up the philosophy of the
military complex of the United
States; tha_t"s totally out of line with
what we're trying to prove here.
We're just saying we want credit
for the work we do."

Painter expressed optimism that
several thousand signatures can be
obtained. thereby demonstrating to
both SGB and FAS that a large"
proportion of Pitt students feel
_ should be given
CAS credit. -

“Students don’t seem to be
opposed to our goal; they're either
neutral about it or in favor of it.

Senate Defeats

Public Works
Job Bill

-BY DAN ROSENTHAL

An amendment that could‘

have meant an increase of up to $60
million in Pennsylvania public
works jobs was dealt a setback last
night when the House of Repre-
sentatives passed version was

defeated 56-31 by the Senate.
The “Heinz _Amendment,"

named after its sponsor, Senator
John Heinz, (R-P), would have

changed a federal allocation
formula so states would receive
equal funds on the basis of the
number of unemployed persons in
the states‘ work force. Presently,
money for public works jobs is
granted on the basis of percentage
unemployed of a state's labor pool.

Pitt Student Runs for Mayor

BY CRISHALL

A Pitt sophomore who says he's
‘ ‘completely serious’ ’ has begun his
campaign for the Pittsburgh
mayoral position to be vacated when
Pete Flaherty deserts the city for
Washington.

Jerry Zidanic, a 21-yea_r-old

' electrical engineering student from

Swisselm Park who currently
resides at 334 Atwood St., filed his
petition at the City-County Building
Monday, making him an official
candidate for the office of Mayor of
Pittsburgh. 1

“I consider myself a serious
candidate,” he said, speaking from
his- makeshift headquarters at the
“Atwood complex, ’.’ where he
resides. “And I feel I can do the job
better than anyone else who's
running.” A '

‘insisting that other Democratic‘

. candidates are ‘‘nothing but a_

bunch of high-falutin’ politicians,”
Zidanic is preparing to take a
grass-roots approach in his bid for
Pittsburgh’s highest elected office.

“I spend half my day going to
school at Pitt an-d the-other half
spinning chickens in George
Aike’n's,” he said. “I talk to
ordinary people—the students and
housewives. I know what they want
better than these guys who sit
around in offices all day.”

Others seeking the Democratic
nomination are city Councilman

.Frank Lucchino, County Controller

John Lynch and County Commis-
sioner Thomas J. Foerster.
Foerster has been endorsed by the
Democratic City Committee.

“I have no personal dislike for
any of the candidates,” Zidanic
said. “It’s,just that they're not
speciﬁc enough.-..I’m not propos-
ing anything, but what the people

CAS Credit

Currently, Pitt’s Schools of
Education, General Studies, Engi-
neering and Nursing offer variable
credit for ROTC courses. CAS is
one of a small number of the
nation's colleges that does not offer
the course credits. Approximately
300 colleges and universities
throughout the United States offer
ROTC courses.

“It's just that the kids are
getting sick and darn tired, and
they keep coming to me and sayin,
‘Why can't we get credit for a
course where 300 other universities
in the country give credit?’ ” said

Lt. Col. Goldstein, professor of
Aero Space Studies and command-
er of Pitt’s Air Force ROTC.

“I think the argument for
reinstituting credit is as strong as it

. can be. The quality of the courses,

the instructors, the whole bit, it's
just been driven into the ground;
there's°no reason why we shouldn't
be given. credit," Painter said.

way to allocate federal monies.
“Under present law." McCarthy
said. “some states receive over
$700 per unemployed person while

others receive as little as $176 per

unemployed person. ’ ’

B. Republican Rep. Bud Shuster
introduced the House version of the
amendment, which passed, 229-
158, Feb. 24.

The Heinz-Shuster formula would
have allocated approximately $270
monthly to states for every
unemployed person in a state's
labor force.

Last year, with a federal
allocation of $2 billion, Pennsyl-
vania received $80 million. If the
amendment had passed the state
could have ‘received. up to $110
million.

“The House has extended the
program though," Shuster said,
“providing funding of $4 billion. If
the amendment would have gone
through conference untouched,
Pennsylvania's piece of the pie
would have doubled to -$220
million.” ‘

Friday, March 11, 1977~THjE‘PITTjNEWS-Page 3   ’

According to McCarthy, opposi-
tion is coming from the large states
who stand to lose money if the
amendment goes through.

“New York and New Jersey
would be big losers so, of course.
they‘ don't like the thing."
McCarthy said. He said 13 states
would have lost money for jobs. 24
would have gained and 13 would
have gone unchanged.

Money. granted under the Public
Works Jobs Bill. shuster said, can
be used by a municipality as it sees
fit. “The only stipulation," he
said, "is that the money must
create jobs. That holds true
whether they repair bridges. build
a ﬁre hall or repair roads."

January unemployment ﬁgures
in Pennsylvania show of a
5,220,200 labor force. 401,100, or
eight percent were unemployed.
The only statistic available for
February as yet shows a 9.1
percent unemployment rate.

A compromise version of the
amendment will come out of

conference in the Senate according-

to McCarthy. “But," he said.
“that may take several weeks."

period of time. It forbids
discrimination against women and
has been interpreted to mean that
you don’t have to Show intent to
discriminate,‘ but rather you only
have to show the discriminatory
effect.”

She said it is for this reason that
Title VII has been effective against
employment discrimination on the

- basis of sex.

“The problem we see with Title
VII now, is that recent Supreme
Court rulings suggest they
(Supreme Court) may be heading in
the direction of making one prove
intent to discriminate, ” Doyle said.
“The Court has hinted at‘the fact
that intent to discriminate may have
to be proven. It is very difﬁcult to
prove , intent to discriminate. ’ ’

V The Pa. Human Relations Act
goes beyond Title VII. According to
the “Women and the Law”
pamphlet, “The Pennsylvania Act
makes it unlawful for any employer,
employment agency, or labor union,
prior to employment or admission to
membership to issue any notice or
advertisement relating to employ-
ment or membership indicating a
preference or discrimination based
on sex; deny or limit through a
quota system employment or
membership because of sex; ask for
or record any information regarding
the sex of‘ the applicant for
employment or membership; or‘
discriminate in any manner against
anyone because he or she has-

the Act, or has made a charge,

However, preference for a
particular sex is not considered
unlawful discrimination when sex in

Another law protecting women
from employment discrimination is
-the federal Equal Pay Act of 1963.
Basically, it states when an employe
claims ‘wage discrimination, the
person will be compared to other
employes of the opposite sex who do
basically the same work, as

  Another Tax-Credit Try

It’s that time of year again. Another senator has introduced
legislation that will make tuition paid to private secondary

schools, vocational schools and public and private institutions of

higher learning tax deductable and/or reduced by a tax credit.

Every year, sometimes more frequently, a bill like this is
introduced. And every time it fails to be passed. Usually the bill
is lost in some sort of legislative labyrinth before it can even reach
the floor for a vote.

The most recent bill was introduced by Pennsylvania Senator
Richard Schweiker and calls for up to a $1,000 income tax
deduction or up to a $250 tax credit on tuition paid.

Anyone who doubts the necessity of this bill should talk to a
college student who searched weeks for a job to raise tuition
money and is now worried about what income tax bracket he’ll
fall into and how much of his needed tax return will be eaten up
by tax due. Nearly all students are single without dependents, the
most vicious tax bracket one can be in. Many of these students
accept a lower standard of living to avoid these tax brackets. In
effect, they are being penalized for working their way through
college. 0

Or the doubters should ask parents putting their kids through
college. They are taxes as if this few thousand dollar expense were
trivial while their upper class counterparts take deductipns of the
same magnitude for business expenses.

It should be a priority of student leaders working within a
statewide’ student lobby to write congressmen involved and visit
them when feasible, to insure passage of this bill. The question

' they must pose to Senator Schweiker is not, “Will you get this bill

passed?” It is, “What new strategy will you employ that will
make sure that this bill does not follow the same route of its.

predecessors?”

strength. The statistics showed
NATO being outgunned'15,700 to
6,755, and aircraft short 3,000 to
1,700. '

Reporting future armament ratio
trends of up to 9-1 in favor of the
Soviets, “Newsweek” said it would
take the Communists just a “matter
of days” to roll’ through West

Germany and reach the‘ English A

Channel.

Because /of a strong nuclear
deterrent, and especially because of
the heavy economic interdepend-

ence between East and West"
gGermany experts

say such a
nightmare is not foreseen as very
likely.‘ In fact, super "power
behavior since the Cuban missile
crisis shows neitherlnation wanting
any nuclear confrontation.

But defense experts’ said the
swiftness and strength of Soviet
conventional forces over under-

_ manned, ill-equipped NATO gives

Russia the option to move either
conventionally or with nuclear
arms, or both. America's choice
rests mainly on a potent nuclear
arsenal.

Included in this argument is the
notion that America may be hesitant
about ﬁring its missiles in response
to an attack on Europe because of
the fear continental United States
may be plastered by Red missiles in
return. ,

However, the Soviet Union is not
my, nor should it be the nation's
immediate security concern. More
frightening is knowing that nuclear
material is becoming easily avail-
able to almost any government or
fanatical organization.

Nuclear proliferation and arms
peddling in general_is a practice all
major nations ' are guilty of
committing, including the United
States. . Prospects of having a
terrorist group like the Palestine
Liberation - Organization obtaining
atomic devicesand hurling them
around the globe is horrifying.

, Even worse is the possibility such
weapons could be used to blackmail
responsible governments into com-
mitting unjust acts. Clearly, a threat I
on a major city -cannot be passed off
as simply another adventure for the
six million dollar man to tackle.

Fortunately, the U.S. govern»
ment can take, and has taken,
steps to lesson the probability of
security threats.

In 1972, Congress passed a law
putting electronic devices and
security personnel at boarding
gates in all American airports to
protect ' against air pigacy.
Skyjacking, a federal crime punish-
able by death, has been nearly
nonexistent since, proving effective
measures can be taken.

Additional actions could include
stopping V the sale of nuclear
materials abroad, increasing the
security of our own nuclear reactors
and stockpiles, stricter screening of
American arms sales, and reaching
agreements with other powers to

_ contain the arms ﬂow.

More constructive use of the CIA,
including surveillance of people and
freight entering and leaving the
country, would also help. Such
steps do not have to include sinister,
activities such as wiretapping or
assaults on individuals, and would
help provide badly needed security.

Admittedly, not even those
actions could prevent world terror- /
ism from unleashing its "venom on

concerned‘ nations including the

United States, but those steps are
no doubt necessary. President
Carter has recognized the problem
and has promised action.

Those actions are welcome, only
because in a volatile world
dominated by probability and
chance, more security is better than
less.

J-Board member

Cooper Decision Defended

I am glad to see that the
University community is guaran-
teed a continued high level of
morality and justice now that the
Student Committee to Defend Dr.
Paul Nyden has branched out and is
ﬁnding other examples of the
“racist atmosphere” at Pitt. I refer
specifically to the letter (Pitt News
3/7/77) in which the committee
complains of the fact that a Campus
Judicial Board placed Kevin
Cooper, former BAS Chairman, on
disciplinary probation.

Since I was a member of the
Judicial Board which imposed that
sanction on Kevin Cooper, I am one
of those labeled a racist by the
committee. The Cooper hearing
was closed so no members of the

‘committee heard the seven hours of

testimony presented in the case. It
is not hard to understand, however,
why they would be unwilling to
allow a lack of information to stand

in the way of a- good, juicy racism‘

charge.

I did hear the seven hours of
testimony, so perhaps I can set the
record straight. If ever a student
was treated with kid gloves, it was
Kevin Cooper. The Board
unanimously found him guilty of an

unprovoked and altogether un-

justified attack upon three fellow
students- The attack put one
student on crutches for two days,
sent one to a hospital for treatment
and badly bruised a third. For this
attack he was put on disciplinary
probation, which is really nothing

more than a warning. It does not"

affect his status as a student and
merely requires that he not
participate in extra-curricular
activities.

- I can state unequivocally that that
is, by far and away, the lightest

sanction ever given a student for a '=

comparable offense during the
three terms I have been a board
member. For those of you who
believe_ things based on the skin
color of the persontelling you, I will
point out that the composition of the
board in the Cooper case was three
blacks and two whites. As pointed
out earlier, we were unanimous in
finding that the attack was
unjustified. _
Kevin Cooper was not a victim, he
was the perpetrator. The only

element of race in the casewas. that-

Kevin Cooper happened to be a
black man and the victims of. his
attack happened to be white. I still
hold to the perhaps quaint notion
that the skin color of the
participants is irrelevant. Ihold as a
truism that an unjustiﬁed attack by
one student upon another is never
justified because of a certain

‘permutation of the participants’
A skin color.

My impression isthat a lot of
_blacks on this campus and
elsewhere have taken the good fight
against racial inequality and turned
it into a ﬁght for unearned special
priviledges and undeserved prefer-

ential treatment. In doing so they i
_ have demeaned the memory ofé
those who died leading the good -

ﬁght. The FBI could harass, abuse
and smear Dr. King, but they could
not destroy the spirit or momentum
of that for which he was fighting. I
hope the blacks on this campus are
not successful in doing what the FBI
could not.

This type of criticism is rare. I
believe that because most white
people, especially administrators at
this University, have been intim-
idated into silence. Angela Davis is

i right. There is a new McCarthyism

on this campus. But instead of
beatin g people into submission with
the word "Communist,” people are
intimidated and coerced under

. _ threat of being labeled “racists.”

The greatest threat to racial
equality and harmony in this

"n. I _ _ _ _ . . . . . . . . . . . n.I.IJll‘.ll!'

.used as a

country is no longer white
establishmentarian intransigence.
It is that tactic of labeling any and
every white person a racist merely
because he is at the moment in an
adversarial relationship with a
person who happens to be black.
This tactic smears the name of the
individual involved, stiﬂes the free
interchange that might have taken
place (and which may have resolved
the matter) and prevents either
party from ignoring the color of the
other person’s skin.

What this will lead to is a massive
intransigence in response to what
the white populace views as a group
of people who want nothing less

than a free ride through life. They

would be wrong to see an attempt to
secure basic rights for a group long
denied them as a free ride. But they
can find isolated examples to
support that view. For instance, the
white student denied admission to a

- law school in favor of a black with

lower LSAT’s and college scores.

But by doing that they would be
doing exactly the sort of thing being
done by the Student Committee to

Defend Dr. Nyden and some blacks T

on this campus. They ﬁnd isolated
examples of racist conduct and they

extrapolate that into the broad,‘

simplistic notion thatevery organ-
ization containing more than a
minority of whites is a racist
organization. '
Am I suggesting that blacks stop
fighting racism? No, butrl am
suggesting that the word stop being
substitute for a
substantive charge of mis-
treatment based on race. I am
suggesting that deliberate use of
the word to slander those with

whom someone disagrees, be

stopped.

I suppose that the gist ofthis
letter is that in some respects the
pendulum of social change has
swung too far; so far that it is having
a counter-productive effect. ‘There
is a great deal of resentment
building up in the white population
on this campus and in our society as
a whole. Some changes will have to
be made. University officials, the
next time a group of blacks decides
to take over an office and hold

» people as hostages, take a bold step

and treat them as the equal of all
students: arrest them. If they
present a list of demands that would

be outrageous but for the fact that
the presenters happen to be black:
reject the demands and call them
outrageous. I am convinced that
then and only then will a realistic
and productive dialogue begin.
But getting back to the Student

Committee to Defend Dr. Nyden. .

That committee has made quite a
few serious charges against the

University with regard to the Nyden

affair. I know nothing about the
Nyden affair and since only a fool
speaks about that of which he knows
nothing, I express no opinion on the
affair. The Nyden Committee knew
nothing about the Kevin Cooper
case and yet it issued slanderous
public charges about that case. If
that reckless, irresponsible and
factually unwarranted charge is an
example of the way the Committee
is conducting Dr. Nyden’s defense,
then I empathize and sympathize
with the University "officials in-
volved in the Nyden case.

RA Dismissal Draws
Protest From Residents \

This letter is to express our
bewilderment and disappointment
in the dismissal of our Resident
Assistant (RA) Mike Bianco. In our
opinion, he was one of the more
congenial and helpful people on the
Office of Resident Life (ORL) staff.
Our friends, who also are Towers
residents, also comment often on
his availability and counsel, not a
quality of every RA at Pitt by any
means.

We were informed that our ﬂoor '

had difﬁculties in past years
between the RA and the residents,
and even among the residents
themselves. But these were ironed
out by Mike immediately this year.

His presence was also felt as a tutor, ‘

consultant and source of encour-
agement to us as students. All of
this tends to make us wonder-about
the selection process that goes on
for the RA at these dormitories.
The essence of the title ‘ ‘ Resident
Assistant” is immediately called to
our attention, because we, the

residents of this ﬂoor, are most
pleased with the performance of our

(‘Continued from Page 4) insistence . Qf some on the

Poor Michael. He was just trying to be friendly. Sort of a cultural exchange. How was he to know

travels to New Guinea to find out just what happened to Michael
Rockefeller in the current issue of OUI magazine. His report makes for
delightful postprandial reading. In the same issue. J. Allen Hynek. world-
renowned expert on UFOs. talks about our shy green visitors in his first-

assessment of the-latest trend in sex counseling for shut-ins. If that doesn’t,

OCHO’s the Number

BY DAVE McDONALD

If you were a loser in the
Litchﬁeld lottery and can’t ﬁnd
anyone commuting daily from
Philly, or if you're just tired of life in
the dorms, it may be time to look
into off-campus housing.

Your ﬁrst step into the Oakland
apartment world should be toward
Pitt’s Off-Campus Housing Office

_ (OCHO) located on Forbes Avenue

across from Hillman Library and
David Lawrence Hall.

OCHO maintains ﬁles on rental
listings provided by landlords,
apartment complexes and real

_ estate agencies. The ﬁles include

listings of sleeping rooms ($75-$90/
month), unfurnished one-bedroom
apartments ($130-$200), furnished
one-bedroom apartments ($150-
$235), unfurnished two-bedroom
apartments ($175-$360), furnished
two-bedroom apartments ($210-
$370) and efficiencies (one-room,
approximately $165 and two-room,
about $220). V .. ,
OCHO also has literature on
furniture rentals, sample leases and
almost anything pertaining to
renting in" Oakland. and the

surrounding area, including lists of
available roommates.

An interesting aspect of OCHO is
its complaint ﬁle. This ﬁle can help
students avoid the lemons in
landlords and apartments. Here is
what some students are saying
about the.apartments and landlords
in Oakland:

“Repairs are unheard of and
security deposits aren’t returned.”

“(The landlord) is a rude,
deceptive landlord; read everything
before you sign.”

“Place smells worse than a
three-month-old litter box. ”

“Shabby; I’ve seen better wine
cellars.”

“Apartment not ﬁt for a dog.”

“Apartment equipped with

roaches andother assorted bugs, -.

don’t waste your time!”

Along with checking the OCHO,
read the classiﬁed ads of The Pitt
News or the Pittsburgh Press. Or,
ask friends ‘about any available
places to rent. It is a good idea to
avoid using “apartment ﬁnders”
when searching'_for a place to live.
These businesses charge around
$35 for lists that are merely taken

from the daily newspapers.

‘Consumer bureaus receive com-
plaints everyday ‘on “apartment
ﬁnders,” particularly Rentex of
Pittsburgh.

After you ﬁnd an available
apartment, there are many impor-
tant things to consider and check
out before signing the lease and
moving in. Take your time and
don’t be afraid to ask a lot of
questions. Some of the questions
and inspections may include:

1) Look over the outside of the

. building. Does it look like it is

adequately and regularly main-
tained?

2) Determine if your apartment
to be has a private entrance.

3) Is there any parking available
(on street, off street or garage)?

 

4) Is there an additional cost for
deposit or a damage_fee?

5) Find out what a usual gas,
electric or water bill is, if they are
not included in the rent.

6) Talk to present and/or
previous occupants on what their
impressions are of the apartment
and the landlord. Also ask them
about any rent increases and if the
landlord is quick to respond to
repairs.

If the apartment checks out okay
up to this . point, go over the
apartment interior with your white
glove and a ﬁne-tooth comb. While
you are playing detective, make
these inspections on the apartment:

1) Check all of the appliances to
make sure they all work properly

began Sunday night with Greek
Sing and will end tomorrow with the

At noon, Monday, the chariots
rolled on Bigelow Boulevard in the
annually held chariot race. The
various ‘fraternity-sorority groups
ran against each other in paired,

1‘, timed races, with Delta Tau Delta

and Chi Omega crossing the ﬁnish
line ﬁrst. -

That night, the Greeks held Fun
Night at Trees Hall with relay races
and other competitive events. Ezra
Krieg, public relations director for
Greek Week, said, “It's just _a
spirited time where ‘people ' get
together and play some games.”
Fun Night winners were Sigma Chi,
Delta Phi Epsilon and Sigma Delta

au.

The All-Greek” mixer was held
Tuesday night at the YM&WHA on
Belleﬁeld Street, with the chugging
contest preceding it. Prospective
chuggers pushed through the doors
to compete by running heats,
chugging beer in various ways:
through straws, back-to-back with
arms hooked, and straight chug-
ging. The mixer and contest were
sponsored by Iron City beer. The
best chuggers turned out to be those
of Theta Phi Alpha, Phi Delta Theta
and Alpha Epsilon Pi; they were
awarded trophies and beer mugs. —

The week of activities rounds out
on Saturday with the formal dance

3) Open all of the windowsand

The old guard of these three
television duos, Sonny and Cher,
has built up quite a following over
the last six years.

Early California grease rockers
in the mid-’60s, the pair dropped
out of sight in the late '60s when
their single hits started to become
few and far between.

The early “Sonny and Cher

Comedy Hours" were funny. The
couple's faces were fresh, the
humor crisp and adult and Cher
emerged as an “Olive Oil” sort of
sex symbol.

But since the breakup of the
marriage and first show in ’74, a lot
has happened to the couple and

grown stale.
Sonny had a show on ABC that

ﬂopped in 13 weeks, while Cher’s

"on CBS was ready to go into_ the

toilet when they decided to get
back together and save their
careers.

On the new show, Sonny and
Cher like to joke about their divorce
and relate the supposedly funny
aspects of an estranged marital
couple working together .profes-
sionally.’ Ho, Ho, Ho. That jive
wore thin after one show.

Cher likes to cut up on Sonny’s

‘diminutive stature, while, Sonny

swats back at "Cher with barbs
about her hooked nose and
pencil-thin body. This goes on

week, after week, after week.

As a singer, Cher is still a great
grafter of all the current hits of the
day, and, their musical duets are

sometimes inspiring. The sketches '

with guests stink.

Cher always plays an exotic
ﬂoozy. Sonny is always placed in a
pizza parlor with the likes of Don
Knotts or Charo. Instead of
laughing, you more often than not
feel like ordering a pepperoni to go.

“Donny and Marie” is the prime
example of a show catered to a
middle-of-the-road audience that
would still consider Lady Chatter-

residuals from toothpaste commer-
cials could be astronomical.

What’s odd about this show is’

that not only is the humor
non-existent, but as singers Donny
and Marie have no sex appeal to
anyone above the age of 12. At
least Cher’s navel holds some
fascination for most of the men of
America.

Eighteen-year-old Donny is the i

singing heartthrob for anyone
entering puberty. A well-groomed
singing robot, he's the Pat boone of
the ’.70s. _

Marie, on the other hand, is only
16. She usually stands center stage
in hand with Donny and sings such
love ballads as “You’ll Never Find
Another Love Like Mine” and “I_
Honestly Love You.” The only
catch——brother and sister sing
them to each other. Figure that
arrangement out.

The hilarious Paul Lynde usually
puts some levity. into the comedy
bits with the dynamic duo, but
Donny and Marie aren't exactly
“The Not Ready For Prime Time

Players." Lynde deserves a better '

comedic vehicle.

On one show, Donny did a
take-off on a Fonzie-like character,
while Marie played the overtly
sexual waitress. The funniest thing
about the sketch was the contrast of
Donny’s teeth with the black
leather jacket; «

that right, honey?,” she says,

So what does he do to loosen up

Classic hat jokes from the
Captain: “What hits home runs

want. I’ll give them.”

What the people want, Zidanic
claims, is a cleaner city, streets
without giant potholes and a mayor
they can come to with their
problems. “That’s how I'll operate
if I’m elected,” he said. “I’ll spend
my day talking to people—seeing
that every person and group in
Pittsburgh gets its share of my
attention.”

Zidanic is a political outsider-
“I’ve never even taken a poli-"sci
course,” he admits—but, though
his knowledge of Pittsburgh’s

political ins and outs is limited, he -

said that won’t hurt his ability to be
mayor.

“When I get elected,” he said,
“I’ll just hire an assistant out of my

own salary, who can take care of a

lot of the bureaucratic work. I'll hire
someone who’s familiar with
Pittsburgh governmentemaybe
Mr. Foerster or Mr. (City Council-
man Richard) Givens—to do all of
the busywork.”

“That will free me to do what I
think the mayor ought to do,” he
continued. “He should go out, talk
to the people and make sure this city

, is giving them all it has to offer.”

Zidanic could offer a few concrete
proposals, but said he'saw “a
drastic need to improve the
streets.” He also said he would
“look into parking and traffic

problems. But I really couldn’t do

too -much about Pitt’s funding,” he
said.
the state and the federal govern-
ment.

“The programs I ‘would have
would cost money,” he said. “I
realize I would be spending money,
but I would make sure I had the
money to spend.

,‘ ‘And, ’ ’ Zidanic said, ‘ ‘I would do
my best not to increase taxes.”

Zidanic. along with all other
mayoral hopefuls, needed a petition
with at least 100,valid signatures to

secure a spot on the May primary‘

ballot.

“My signatures came mostly
from Pitt students,” said Zidanic,
“and they had to be registered

, Democrats and city residents. ,

“A few asked my opinions and
proposals," but most people just
wanted to know what the petition
was for before they signed.”

Zidanic said he encountered no
problems at the City-County
Building, where ‘completed peti-
tions were ﬁled. “They didn’t

' consider it a joke,” he said. “As far

as I know, they don’t give
preference to anyone. They took it
quite seriously.”

Zidanic said he wanted no link
with Pitt during the campaign.
“This has nothing to do with Pitt,
other than the fact I’m a student
here. My campaign will not be

_ Pitt-oriented. ’ ’ '

The candidate said he hopes the
campaign will not interfere with his
studies at Pitt. “The election isn’t
until May 17 and the courses I’—m
takingnow aren’t that hard. The
combination should make it a little

easier for me than it might have V

been.”
Should he be elected, Zidanic

. said, he would try to continue his

In

or two—-I’d like to stay in school.
But if school interfered with my
duties as mayor in any way. I would
quit,” he said. “Maybe I could
return after my term, or terms, are
through.

“The most I could serve would be
two terms,” Zidanic said, looking
four years into the future. “I feel
someonevshouldn't go longer than
that. If they can't get their

programs working in that time. they‘

should step aside and let someone

knows, that doesn't ‘mean they’ll
vote for him. . _ .

Asked if he was disappointedthat
Foerster was endorsed by the
Democratic City Committee, Zid-
anic laughed. “The people of
Pittsburgh didn’t endorse _Foers—
ter,’_’ he claimed. “It was‘ just an

  
   

elite group of politicians, wearing
their high-classed tuxedoes and
gowns, who got together and picked
Commissioner Foerster.

“I wouldn’t want to be supported
by them,” he said. “I want my
support to come from the average
people.”

Zidanic said he is not intimidated
by Foerster’s greater public recog-
nition and-resources. “He’s just a
big, old fuddy-duddy,” he said.

“A lot of people think my

candidacy is good,” Zidanic said.

“At first, they thought I was crazy,
but now they’re taking it seriously.
They recognize me as a candidate, ’ ’
said Zidanic, who describes himself
as “liberal, but not too much.”
Would Zidanic bet on his

. chances?

“I wish you hadn't asked that,”
he said. “Realistically speaking, I
probably don’t have much of a

‘ chance.

“But I'm giving myself enough of
a chance that I can make it. Iwant to
make it, and with that going for me,
I will.”

BY SHARON FLAKE

Seventy-one-year-old primitive

‘artist Milton Fletcher started a

career in painting ﬁve years ago,
after retiring as an executive
secretary at the YMCA is Shreve-
port, Mississippi.

He had never used a paint brush
before then. “My teacher
discouraged me against drawing
when I was a child in Yazoo,
Mississippi. She told me she didn’t
want me to learn anything,” said
Fletcher. ‘‘I told her not to worry,
because I wasn't capable of learning
anyway.” (Fletcher went to Yazoo
High School and graduated from
Rust College in Holly Springs,
Miss., in 1929.)

In an attempt to improve his
painting, which he describes as
“crude figures,” Fletcher took
courses at a recreational center in
Shreveport.

An instructor advised him not to

alter his style by taking lessons.
She bought his first painting for
$15, and was a primary factor in
launching his career.
I Fletcher paints every evening
from 7 p.m. to 12 a.m., listening to
the tunes of Bessie Smith, Glenn
Miller, Al Hirt and the original
recording of Porgy and Bess. “I’m
not a musician,” he said, “but I
sure like music.”

Spirit: ’Mann’s’ Best Friend?- ‘

BY JOAN GUBERNICK

Mann and Spirit
Studio Theatre
Directed by Beth Lott

Poor Amias Mann—not only is he
unemployed, unloved and mis-
treated, but he also manages to find
himself in the leading role of
“Mann and Spirit,” the musical
currently playing at the University
of Pittsburgh's Studio Theatre.

An original musical allegory
written by Ed Risden and Rob Plotz,
“Mann and Spirit” is the story of
Amias Mann (James DiDonato), a
lonely, illegal immigrant from
Yurania. Mann, followed by his
all-knowing‘ Spirit (Scott Mortimer),
lives in Harriet’s Hobo Haven, run
by Sister Harriet (Caryn Ronis), an
imposter faith healer who uses the
hobos in her haven as illegal tax
deductions. She is already
subsidized by the Government.

Along the way, Mann meets and

f"'‘" in love with the ﬂower
woman-——Mimi’ Kind (Shawn
Loefﬂer). who gives him the

strength to break away from evil

paintings-—a girl whose coffin ‘is I

chained to the ground, the reaction
of people at funerals or the
components of jazz music—come
from his childhood or recent
experiences.

These themes ﬁnd their way into
Fletcher’s imagery: saxaphones,
clarinets, cars, a riverboat, the
famous St. Louis Arch, cotton
pickers, cows and the faces of Louis
Armstrong, Ray Charles, Duke
Ellington, Nat King Cole and Ella
Fitzgerald.

Beverly Peteet, who teaches the
only black American art course at
Pitt, described Fletcher as one of
the best primitive artists around"
today. “lt’s remarkable and
commendable that a man could
have a complete career in one thing
and then start another,” she said.

Peteet took her class to see
Fletcher’s collection because,
“They have to go out and
experience what art, especially
black art, is really all about.”

One painting that expresses
Fletcher’s experiences in the South
and with the railroad (he was a
porter for four years) is the “Casey
Jones Wreck.” Fletcher said he
was encouraged by his 80-year-old
uncle to paint it. “I went to the
actual site where it occured and got
a real feel for the area.”

“Many times I'll take something
that I remember from childhood and

Harriet. Harriet, alarmed at losing
a tax deduction and angry at Mann,
frightens Mimi away and reports
Mann to the immigration ofﬁce.

Mann, however, with the help of
his Spirit, eventually wins back
Mimi, escapes the immigration
officers and gets a second chance at
life. Harriet is caught and arrested
by one of her hobos who is an
undercover agent for the govern-
ment. She manages. to escape,
however.

Theplay, done in three acts with
two intermissions, has 18 musical
numbers, each needing some
adjustments or tightening. Chor-
eography by Charlie Heckathome
and Nick Vukmanic did ﬁt the
music, but unfortunately the hobo
ensembles could not keep in step
with each other, ruining the effect.

There were a few good ideas,
such as a “Me and My Shadow"
routine between Mann and his
Spirit in a number entitled “There
is Someone Who Needs You”
(which seems to be the theme of the
show). A provocative bump and
grind routine 'by Sister Harriet
highlighted “Say Amen,” and an

place it in a present-day" situation.
Like I did in a painting of my
daughter’s wedding, which I set in
the church I used to go to as a boy.”

Fletcher said being a primitive
artist gives him many liberties. “I
don’t paint fast like instructors want
me to. I’m slow and messy. I don’t
use an easel either. I lay the canvas
down on the table.” A

He also polishes stones, collects
photographs and paints Christmas
cards for friends.

interpretive, moving dance solo by
Nick Vukmanic does the same for
‘ ‘There Will Come a Time. ’ ’ For the
most part, however, the ensemble’s
dancing was sloppyzb missing beats
and often dancing out of step.

Ronis was the highlight of ‘ ‘Mann
and Spirit.” With a strong, clear
voice and a saucy southern accent,
she played the conniving _ Sister
Harriet to the hilt. . _

Mary Beth Kuznik was also

amusing in her small ‘role as the
employment ofﬁcer. Her song,
“Take a Number,” was the most
entertaining number of the pro-
duction; - she seemed to enjoy
herself as the character and had the
proper voice to back it up.
- The voices of the hobo ensemble
were very weak and often
indistinguishable. Separately,
people like Loefﬂer and Mortimer
had pleasant voices but were just
not loud enough.

Costuming by Peggy Adkins was
colorful and imaginative in the
ensemble sequences, although the
group reminded one of a band of
gypsies rather than hobos.

Devilish Effects In
Pittsburgh's Faust“  

BY PAMELA EUSI

Faust
Pittsburgh Opera Company
Directed by Barbara Karp

Special effects and two great
leads secured success last night for
the Pittsburgh Opera’s fourth
production of the season, Charles
Gounod’s “Faust.”

Since Barbara Karp has entered '

the realm of Pittsburgh Opera she
has. tried to modernize the stage
production. Although some might
say she is turning Pittsburgh into
Broadway with her conceptions,
perhaps this is what the city needs
to give new plasma to a hemophiliac
stage. . '

“Faust” contained two scenes
with modern effects not including
the scenery and house frames which
were made out of blocks of bare
metal pipes. Act 1, scene I in
Faust’s study included a slide show
back through Faust’s youth with
erotic paintings and symbols
ﬂashed behind the main stage
setting.

Act III, scene l—in church where
a pregnant Marguerite goes to pray
for guidance and forgiveness—we
are involved with her mental
anguish not only through her facial
expressions but also through the
swirling colors revolving in "the
background while Mephistopheles
taunts her to despair.

This opera demands special
effects because of the nature of the

supernatural included  the story.

Therefore the spectator can revel in
the feast provided for his ears and
eyes.

As. Faust, the aging scientist
turned youth, Pierre Duval made a
credible player but his voice did not
come through. If the lead cannot be
heard from the third row, some-

‘ thing is wrong. Hisvoice registered

only in the throes of anger, hatred or

‘ extreme passion. These emotions

are not presented every second,
consequently the voice could not be
heard. When there. was an
emotional moment, Duval fared
well; more so
register—tenor heaven.

Justino Diaz as Mephistopheles
wormed his way into‘ everyone’s
heart. His characterization ﬁt just
right and his superb bass range
rounded out the perfect devil
image.

The female lead, Marguerite,

_was played by Heather Thomson.

Dramatically and vocally she ﬁt the
bill. In her solos, ducts and triosshe
stood out as a direct and exact
vocalist.

Gounod’s music and the libretto
of Jules Barbier and Michel Carre
give ﬁtting tribute to part one of the
‘ ‘Faust” written by Johann Goethe:
The story is a familiar one involving
the devil's promise of youth to an
aging scientist, Faust, if he signs a
contract with Satan. ‘

matter. A thoroughly trained artist,
skilled in the sleight-of—hand
techniques, to produce a more
realistic depiction would lose the
honesty felt in Fletcher’s work.

Fletcher’s paintings are not
accurate by any technical meaning
of the word. But they are true. As
stale or canned as it sounds, they
capture honestly an unmistakable
ﬂavor of rural South.

What is especially striking in his
work is that his scenes. are of
recognizable. smalltown subjects,
represented with the trueness. that
the new realists of the urban areas
never strike.

First, urban painters lack such
subject matter. Where in the city
would one locate a model with the
countriﬁed honesty represented in
his “Nursing Time” portrait of a
mother.

Slick city painters are beyond his
simple capturing ‘of an old couple
enjoying a swing (literally) through
their “Second Youth.” Yet‘on a
canvas only inches wide and tall,
Fletcher makes the couple and their

. experience—-husband pushing wife

on a swing—real to us with a few
sketchy black and white oil patches. .

He does the same with-his color H
landscapes of ordinary farm-life
scenes. It’s all wrong technically

A simplistic setting of trees and

possible. Joyce Brenner, scenic
designer, used wood materials and

ﬂowers and greening to highlight
park scenes to show the better side
of life.

time to work out the quirks that
were all tooevident in the material
she worked with. Perhaps as the

impatiently—unti1 his subtle
undertone penetrates over-stimu-
lated sensibilities.

But let's not. make him into an
unconscious artist whose brain
knows not what his hand does. The
man is aware he just doesn’t front
a slick cover.

How else would he compose the
striking depiction of his black and
white oil “The Men and a Beat”?
It’s a tight arrangement of ﬁgures

' and inﬂected black/white brush-

work, capturing the rough, robust
activities of the men against the
teasing of the river waves.

- Just" as striking is his poignant

depiction of hope in “There is a ’

Future,” which poses a pregnant
lady in a simultaneous state of

dejection and renewed energy.

No Longer in the Spotlight 

BY JIM FARERI

RA
Utopia
Bearsville BR 6965

If it is possible for an album to be .

epic, “RA”is. It has that
larger-than-life feel that Todd
Rundgren has always sought on his
solo LPs and past Utopia efforts.

Rundgren has been around for a
long time. . So has Utopia. But this is
a new Utopia, revitalized, ener-
gized, forging new directions that
some thought the recently not-up-
to-par Rundgren would never ﬁnd.

Utopia is sharp like it has never
been before, it is honed and trim, no
longer vocal disdaining, but vocal
embracing. And also no longer the
vehicle of Rundgren’s social
prophecies——a role some critics
believe limited previous Utopia
albums.

Rundgren has dissolved as the
center of Utopia and let sheer
cohesiveness and energy take over.
Now with four players, Utopia is

bursting through the walls with

fresh writing and recording talent.

Side one is energy.” The ﬁve

allowing the group to perform as a more cohesive unit, giving them a

sense of huge waves of energy
being captured and channeled to
the musicians’ ﬁrmly resolved
ends—complete, total, control.
Harmony vocals abound, as do
intricate shifts in time and little, but
effective, musical twists. The music
explodes. '

Side two is a pinnacle of music
achievement. “Hiroshima, ’ ’ co-
penned by Rundgren and key-
boardist R. Powell, is one of the
most stirring pieces of contemp-

.orary music one has ever heard:

pop and rock, with the grim ﬂavor of

{oriental music seeping deep within,

and the deadly undertones of
revenge. “We'll show those axis
powers/How to make an oven":

one cannot listen to “Hiroshima”
just once-—and never sitting down.

Following is “Singring And The
Glass Guitar,” whimsical “electri-

all four Utopians. At this point of
the LP, especially after hearing .
“Hiroshima,” one realized that
only Utopia has the discipline and
know-how to record such a potential

ﬁasco with such overwhelming‘

SUCCCSS.

This album is well worth the price

Thursday, March 10. 3 _ _

There seems to be only one occupation less secure than ldi Amin’s fortune-teller
—that of a coach. P .. .

“You cap’t fire the .whole team,” comes the cry in the professional ranks when a
team struggles for _a winning way. Naturally, the coach getsvthe boot.

But what does it mean when a coach gets hit with theleather despite a winning
reputation? -The Penquins canned popular Marc Boileau several years ago despite
his responsibility for the resurgence of the team and their appearance in the I975
Stanley Cup quarter-finals. Usually when a winning coach gets fired it comes from
dissension from within the organization or unpopularity with the players combined
with the management‘s unwillingness to  ' ‘ ' — i '
support him. Al McNeil was fired_ as
coach of the Montreal Canadiens several
years ago after winning the Stanley Cup
just for that reason.

Now, on a lower level, how do you

   

basketball coaches who put together very
successful I6-8 and I8-7 campaigns?

“I have no comment except "that we’re .. .
dissatisfied with their coaching,” said PAT WALl.A(,‘l'.'
Sandy Bullman, Pitt’s assistant athletic director for women’s sports, following
Friday's dismissal of Pantherette floor coaches Pat Wallace and Jean Balthaser.
Ah, well, it must be something besides their coaching, because their records in their

 

‘two-year tenure at Pitt speak for themselves. Maybe it was Bullman’s desire for a

quick national title (success spoils us all, doesn’t it?) which was the reason for the
dismissal of these and two other women’s basketball coaches-—-Jean Condo and
assistant Jan Kasnevich——in November of I975, according to the ousted Condo.
Like Wallace, Condo was also a winning coach (I0-6) who had a very legitimate
gripe in saying; “We were not given a chance to prove ourse|ves.” Apparently, the
team wasn’t given any reasons for the change either. As a scholastic coach at
Montour High School, Condo ran up a 154-39 record during an II-year period.

Kasnevich her assistant at Pitt went.8I-9 in six years as coach of the Montoun

  
  

junior varsity. In I(asnevich’s first
season as JV coach at Pitt, she directed
the squad to a 7-2'mark and taught a
number of‘-the current varsity players.
Enthusiastic about the I975-76
campaign, Condo and Kasnevich walked
into Bulltr.an’s office, saw their one-year
contracts lying on the desk ‘before them
and heard the assistant athletic director
_ H say, “As of this date. you are no longer
_ ._ 5-  I‘ employed by the University of
Jl-.A.N (. )N'l)() Pittsburgh." That's how the athletic
department does it. You win and you're gone. Condo, understandably, said she
was “shocked.” -
Now, history repeats itself. An assistant to Condo for two years and her
subsequent replacement, Wallace rolled up a 226-31 state (including a perfect 22-0 in
I975) at Lancaster Catholic High School. Her honors there inclttdcd the I974
Pcnttsylvania state title,‘two district titles, a county championship and a 62-ganlc
winning streak. She was named “Outstanding Coach of the Year" in I975 by
Lancaster County media. ' -
Last night's sound I()l-64 defeat at the hands_ol' St. .loseph‘s, to knock t_he
Pantherettes out of the Eastern Association of Intercollegiate Athletic for Women
(EAIAW) playoffs, came after the dismissals and therefore had no hearing on
Wallace's fate. It would seem her showillg against Lock Haicn. wholn the

. Tennis springing Back  

BY PIXIE SOHN_

Put away those winter 'woollies,
mittens, fleece-lined boots, and snow
shovels. ‘Get out the skimpy dresses,
tee-shirts, bunny socks and rackets.
Tennis season has returned.

This week, the women’s tennis team
begins its spring (or second) season.
They will be meeting about five schools
0r*'their schedule, including such
powerhouses as Ohio State, Maryland
and Penn State. In addition, they will be
involved
Virginia Tournaments.

‘ “We're beginning heavy practices
now," head coach Nancy Gordon said.
“We are going to be better and stronger
this year. It is essential, really-our
schedule has a lot of challenges in it.”

Setting the stage for a promising
season was the victory Pitt achieved at
the annual Saranac Cup Tournament
held February 26. By defeating
Maryland and Ohio State, the mixed
team of, Maria Paris, janet DeCostro,
Janiee Irwin, Tom Libinguth and Mike
and Harry Habbel proved they can come
up against and beat the best.

‘fIt’s a good sign for the new year,”
reflected Gordon. “The ironic twist to
the story is that Ohio State has won the
Saranac Cup the past two years while it
also has won the_Heisman Trophy. This
spring, we reserved the honors.”

The three female members of the Cup
team-—Paris, DeCostro and Irwin-also
comprise the top three positions on the
regular squad. Each has her own
thoughts on the upcoming season.

“This winter I didn’t do a lot of
practicing because of the‘ weather,”
Paris-claimed. “I've been back —at'it
about three weeks now and feel good.”

Paris who lives in Largo, Florida, also
found the weather to be one of the
causes for a case of homesickness that
had a negative effect on her game. To
cure the problem, she recently spent a

week at home to relax, think and warm-
np_

“It gave me time" to put my head
together,” she reported back in
Pittsburgh. “I’m ready to give it one
more shot. The Saranac Cup was a great
start.“ ‘ I

Paris's start was particularly
impressive as she went 6-0 in singles
play, the last two wins coming off tough,
top-eastern players.

Now is the time for the spring season
and Paris has set some personal goals‘;
one is to go to Nationals. Last fall she
qualified to go, but before Pitt will send
her to Arizona in June for this year’s
meet, she has to finish in the top four.
The second specific goal is to win either-

-the tournaments at’Middle.$tates (at
Princeton)'_ or Virginia.

particularly excited to take some
teammates along, as before she was the
sole qualifier.

According to Coach Gordon,
DeCostro showed “a lot of guts” at the

MARIA PARIS.

Saranac Cup when she fought, along
with mixed doubles partner Tom
Libinguth, for an exciting 5-3 tiebreaker
victory. Using the World Team Tennis
rule system, Janet found “heavy mental
pressure” in the scoring style.

“Our_ team was really psyched as a
whole,” DeCostro reported after the
Saranac victory. “After the win we
threw our rackets in the air and were
hugging each. other. Now the team is

Wilson photo

really willing to work hard.”
What DeCostro is looking to do this

season is to “go out and do my best"
and to “concentrate for each match.”
She, too, is looking forward to a good
showing in the tournaments and a trip to
the Nationals.

Irwin also has high hopes for the
second season. A member of the track
team, Irwin finds herself in good shape.
Next year, with the encouragement of
Gordon, who finds Irwin a “hard
worker who’s game‘ is really coming
along”, she will give up track and
participate only in tennis.

“I think I've come a long way from
last year,” Irwin stated. “I feel nervous
being number-three with little experience
I've had compared to some of the others
on the team. What this season means to
me is the experience I'll get to improve so
next year will be my best ever.”

‘ Her goals along the route of gaining
experience also include “always going
out to win.”

With these three players, plus
upcoming freshmen Pam Bachman and
Nancy Ballistrari, Pitt is building a
strong team for years to come.

“We are really getting better,” Paris
said. “By the time I'm a senior (in two
years) this team will really be built-up."

This spring season will be a tough start
for the team. The practices are hard and
the schedule demanding. Gordon's
philosophy on winning tennis is “just
hitting the ball back one more time than
your opponent.”

   Dukes Eying VMI Only  

PITTSBURGH (AP)——Duquesne is
taking them one game at a time——a
sound approach since that’s how they
got to the NCAA playoffs in the first
place.

The Eastern Collegiate Basketball
League champs play VMI in first-round
competition Saturday. Though tickled
to be there, the Dukes are not looking
beyond that contest.

“That's the same way we went into the
conference tournament,” said coach
John Cinicola. “We knew that we were

' . scheduled to play Penn State first and

that’s the only game we were concerned
about going in.”
But Cinicola could not conceal his

excitement during a meeting with
newsmen Thursday. g

“We’re elated to be going to the
playoffs. I know our players feel that
way, especially our seniors Norm Nixon,
Don Gambridge, and Don Maser. They
have been here four years and this is
their first opportunity to go to a
tournament.”

Duquesne, a Cinderella entry in this
weekend's playoff activity, finished the
season with a l5~I4 record—not exactly
the stuff of which national champions
are made. But Cinicola is proud of the
infant East Indies conferences which his
Dukes represent. ‘

“We don’t only represent Duquesne,
we represent the city of‘Pittsburgh.i And

we also represent our conference, which
I feel is going to he an outstanding
conference.

“This year, four of the eight teams are
involved in post-season tournament
play, which tells you something about
the conference."

Cinicola said he’s pleased with the

- NCAA bracket to which the Dukes have
i been assigned and, though he doesn’t

know much about VMI, his scouts
gathered as much intelligence as possible
for Saturday night's game.

“Once we found out it would be VMI,
we got on the phone and got as much
information as we could about them.
I'm just so pleased that we’re taking part
in it at all.”

Robert Morris Escortes
Rollers to End of Lane

The Pitt bowling ‘team, under first-
year captain Geoff Joseph, ended its
season by losing two out of three games
to Robert Morris College, which finished
just above the young Panthers in the
Western Pennsylvania Intercollegiate
Bowling Conference (WPIBC)
standings.

The first game was the highlight of a
dismal day‘ for Pitt. The Resident
Student Association—sponsored Panthers
came away with an 845-792 win, sparked

.by freshmen Kevin Fleischood and

Jacqui Kemp. The remainder of the day,
however, went downhill.

In the second game, the Panthers

Grapplers’ Complaints Fall Flat

be given one more chance to improve the men’s program. Who's next? Perhaps
hockey coach Lenny Barcalow who has led the Pitt icers to I9-2-I, I9-3-2, 9-7-l and
I2-5-I seasons. But the athletic department can’t get Barcalow——not until they start

paying him to win. _
They're never satisﬁed

Newspapers can’t please all the people all the time, and it's hard enough just to
please some of them. A newspaper that keeps up on everything has yet to be
printed. So they do their best and hope everything is covered as sufficiently as
possible. A

Every once in a while, we at the Pitt News sports department receive complaints
from the various sports that theirs is not covered to the fu|lest—whether the
complaintant is from the intramural department or the rifle team. For the first time,
though, the Pitt wrestling team is getting in on the act. First‘ the team's manager,
elevated to spokesman, filed an hour-long phone complaint, then Skip Bolin, the
Panthers’ undefeated grappler who is NCAA championship bound along with Bill
Bailey and Mark Stepanovich, took it upon himself to air a complaint via a smart-
aleck insult that need not be repeated here.

“If he made that type of statement I can’t say anything about it,” alibied Coach
Dave Adams. "If he did do that he's incorrect in doing it. It was poor judgment on
his part. If he had a complaint, he was wrong in doing that.”

Bolin, who is supposed to be representing the integrity of this University, just
blew it in my eyes. Bolin and I don't know each other personally and he didn’t care
to talk about the situation in a business-like manner. It reminded me of the time
Pat Livingston of the Pittsburgh Press and former Steeler Lou Michaels almost
came to blows in the Three Rivers Stadium locker room last November over
something Livingston had written. ‘

But the manager, who said he was speaking on behalf of Adams (who said. he

knew nothingof the call ‘until afterwards), was slightly more rational, but not much.
Still, I couldn't understand why Adams didn’t confront me with the gripe himself. I
ended up calling him. »
“I can’t say we’ve been overly pleased with the coverage,” he began. ‘‘It’s been
rather skimpy. Having come from the most outstanding meet in the East and having
the most outstanding wrestler (Bolin) in the meet, we expected better coverage. I
don’t begrudge any sport any coverage they can get. But we have to look out for our
own sport, too.”

Adams’ biggest complaint stems from the Associated Press article_ that appeared.

in Monday’s Pitt News. Some people forget there are things known as deadlines.
Adams was called all day long—the last call coming at approximately I0 p.m. (five
hours past our deadline)—with no answer. The manager was furious at the
supposedly erroneous AP article. I asked both gentlemen, if something so
outstanding happened at the Eastern Wrestling League championship, why couldn't
they have phoned it in like many other teams do.

Where they got the idea we should cater to them or that we should promote them, ' I

I don’t know. Cheerleading is for the Sportsvlnformation Office, not a newspaper.
Adams countered, however, “I understand because of your involvement, hockey

—

gets preferential treatment. My answer is this—where else have you ever seen a
Pitt hockey article? It’s not their fault the skaters hold club status; they don’t want

it that way. But when they failed miserably on defense in recent games, I let them .

have it, the comments disturbing defenseman Larry Gallick so much that he let me
know it. He did it business-like, not with an irate phone call or vulgar remark.

This season, the wrestling team has taken up more column inches than in recent
years, despite a mediocre record. In I974-75, the team finished the regular season 8-

4 and got 279.5 column inches. A year later, competing for space against a vastly‘

improved football squad, the matmen got 251 column inches in a great I2-4
campaign. And this past season, only 6-6 and fifth out of six teams in the Eastern
Wrestling League, their coverage by far exceeded that of past years, reaching 305.5
column inches. ‘ . ‘ . _ »

“I guess coaches are hard to satisfy anytime,” Adamsreasoned. “Of course,
players could be that way too because coaches are always pressuring the players. If
they achieve something they’d like to be recognized for it.” ‘

True, and they are. A look at Pitt ‘News issues over the Past threeyears, one finds
very little coverage outside of football, basketball and, yes, wrestling. Women’s
sports received previews here and there but results seldom appeared. Hockey was
covered adequately and I admit to being biased. But no other sport can complain-
the minor ones have been covered from soccer all the way down to bowling. Of
course, we would like to do more and also cover sports such as lacrosse, rugby
etc., but space limitations severely hamper us. '

Everyone will never be pleased. And it’s about time athletes and their coaches -

realize that. This is my last column as sports editor. I hope the new regime is as
much an advocate of the minor sports as I am. The minor sports deserve coverage as
much as football and basketball. Let’sjust hope they don’t getgreedy. I

started as they did in the first, only to see
a four-mark lead in the-fourth frame
disappear and become an eight-mark
deficit by the seventh, a‘ feat
accomplished by a Robert Morris
barrage of strikes and a Pitt cold streak
that was to last the rest of the afternoon.
The Panthers lost the game by a count of
820-720.

The third contest was a continuation
of the lackluster Pitt performance, as the
Panthers were again collared by the
Colonials, 960-787. By losing the game
and the match, the Panthers’ final
record fell to I6-54.

Even though‘Pitt’s mark was under
.500 the entire season, there were many
highlights as the Panthers played the role
of spoilers. Their biggest upset victory
of the year came when the young Pitt
squad stole two games from the
powerful Duquesne Dukes.

This season Pitt was made up of a host’ '

of freshmen. Of the six who made the
team, three of four started and the rest
were top substitutes. The remainder of
the team was comprised of.a-sophomore,
a junior and three seniors. ‘

A few of the year’s highlights were:
Jerry Villela’s 200 and Mark Suekoff’s
198 games- that helped bolster the
Panthers to a victory against league
champ St. Vincent, Al Bryce’s team-high
245 followed by Mark RandalI’s 22I.,-
Joseph’s 599 series and Steve Fendler’s
excellent 572, and Kemp’s appearance in
a WPIBC game, the first time a woman
bowled a frame in the league. _

The Panthers lacked consistency this
year. Of all the rollers, Fendler,
Suekoff, Rick Louden and Fleischood
were the most consistent. Eight of the II
team members will be returning,
however, and with their youth they will
definitely improve and possibly be
contenders in a year or two. I

first Annual
‘EAlAWMeet

The long, stuffy indoor track season‘

. comes to a climax this Saturday in

Hanover, New Hampshire, when the
Pantherettes compete in the first annual
Eastern ‘ Association for - Intercollegiate
Athletics for Women (EAIAW) meet at
Dartmouth College. _ A »

Ten Pitt athletes have qualified for
this championship meet. One
runner—Tina Spivey——also qualified,
but was injured during practice last week
and will not run. _

High jumpers Marie Ribik and Karen
Krichko have perhaps the best chance of
winning. Ribik was‘ fourth in last
season’s national AIAW meet, while

f-'\.

Krichko tied for first in the outdoor’

Easterns championship. ‘ -
In the other jumping event, Pam Shaw
_and Lisa Sciullo will attempt to win
honors in the long jump. Competing in
the half—mile event will be ‘Brenda
Chorpenning, while shotputter Carmen’
Scherich, ‘ doing very well lately in
practice, could come up with her best
throw of the year this weekend.
Counting trials, semi-fimals and
finals-, Janice Irwin may have the hardest
job of all Saturday. She will run the 440—
mile- and 880-relays all within a span of
eight hours. ,
The Pantherette duo of Michelle
I Bressant and Sue Lewis are entrants in
the 60-yard hurdles. Both did well at the
Ohio State Invitational earlier this year,
but will hve to compete against the
defending outdoor nation-al champ,
Carolyn Thompson. That pair will team
up with Maria Sciullo and Irwin in the
mile‘ relay. The 880-relay of Shaw,
Lewis, Krichko and Irwin, like the other,
Will. have to run against the likes of
Rutgers, Maryland and Morgan State.
