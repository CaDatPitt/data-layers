,,New‘Jazz Workshop Has Over 10

T7’

President of Club
Discusses History
Of ‘Improvisation’

By JUNE GRAHAM

A great composer once said,
“Don’t talk about music, just
play or enjoy it.”

Such is the purpose of the
Pitt Jazz Workshop, which
originated last semester and
now has a membership of over
100 jazz enthusiasts.

According to Webster (Dave
eisle, president, of the work-
shop, does not disagree), Jazz is

 characterized by its highly emo-

tional melodic line and its strong-
ly marked syncopated rhythms.
Dave clariﬁed the deﬁnition by
adding that the distinguishing
feature of Jazz is the improvisa-
tion of the musicians. In other
words, the Jazz musician plays
the way he feels —- emotionally.
History and Evolution

When asked about the history
and evolution of Jazz, Dave dis-
played a wide knowledge of the
subject.

*_‘../.Dave claims that Jazz is the

only truly American art form.
Music experts regard Jazz as one
of the most distinctive of Amer-
ican contributions to the musical
world, he said.

Jazz originated in the late
19th century among Negro mu-
sicians of New Orleans, but it
was not ‘fully developed until

1910.’ The word jazz itself is of -

uncertain origin.

The original Jazz ensemble was

small and composed chiefly of
’the trumpet, cornet, trombone,
clarinet, various percussion in-
struments, and occassionally the
piano and saxophone. Emphasis

V {was on the ability of the indivi-

dual player to improvise. As the
size of the ensemble grew, more
formal arrangements became nec-
essary. Jazz was not seriously or
critically studied until the l930’s.
~ An early form, known as
“New Orleans” jazz, was popu-
lar during the 20s and was

I

   

O O 0
characterized by a 3-4 beat. It
began spreading up the Missis-
sippi River to Chicago where it
evolved into “Ragtime” or jazz.

During the 30’s and 40’s
“Swing” became the topic of the
day. Swing was popularized by
such favorites as Benny Goodman,
Glen Miller, and Tommy Dorsey.

At the end of World War II
Swing moved out of the picture
and “Be Bop” became the leading
form of jazz. This was an entirely
new type of jazz with distinctive
ideas. This was the era of the
‘zoot suit” and Bop talk.

Progressive Jazz
Be Bop died down in the late
40’s paving the way for “Cool”
or Progressive jazz.

Modern Jazz, which is now
“the absolute end” is a combina-
tion of Bop, Cool, and Progres-
sive Jazz. '

The Jazz club was formed with
the idea that" since the largest
audience for modern Jazz is
found in colleges and universi-
ties, an organization was needed
at Pitt to_ create and promote an
active interest in Jazz. Clubs of

this type have been very suc-

plays professionally with a group of his own. The Jazz Club was

cessful in other universities across
the country.

Commenting on the goal of
the club, Dave stated, “Modern
Jazz - is very complex for the
beginner to understand. It is
probably one of the finest forms
of music today because of the
sincerity, warmth, and ingenuity
of the musicians. The goal of
our club is to bring a greater
appreciation of Jazz to Pitt stu-
dents.” l

Dave, who is an advertising

V major in the school of Business

Administration, e x p r e s s ed a
strong distaste for, “Rock ’n Roll.”

He thinks it is shameful the way .

pepole link it with Jazz. To him

Rock ’n Roll is “just a bunch of

trashy noise.” A ~
The first affair sponsored by the

Pitt Jazz Workshop this year, was i

after the Pitt—Oregon game.

Secretary, Edna Hill; Corres-
ponding Secretary, Pat McMo-
han; and Treasurer, Joe Sanford.

Private Plane

around with his head in the
clouds, the University of Pitts-
burgh’s progressive young
chancellor, Edward H. Litch-
ﬁeld, will nevertheless ‘be
spending much time in the high-
est atmosphere from now on.

This. will be possible now, since
the Chancellor has recently pur-
chased his own airplane. In an
effort to save time and keep ap-
pointments in the many various
cities which require his presence,
he has bought an “Apache,” twin-
engined Piper. "

The 41-year-old educator will-
fly the plane himself on occa-
sions, since he holds a private .
pilot’s license. But most of the
ﬂying will be done by Major
Leroy Smith, commander of the
Pittsburgh Air _National Guard.
Major Smith has been appointed
to the University staff, as Chan'-
cellor’s pilot and field repre-
sentative.

Dr. Litchﬁeld is , required to
make many. ﬂights to Washington,
D. C., as a result of his chairman-
ship of the Board of the Govern-
ment Affairs Institute. Also, his
recent appointment as chairman

~ of the board of»Smith—Corona, Inc.,

typewriter manufacturers, will

 take him to New York often.

You’ve been contacted by many

yourself to consider which of these

 A Clumce To Change   

Wednesday, November 7, workers for the Pitt Chest will
speak in classrooms for the purpose of obtaining contribu-
tions in the Chest’s annual drive. We hope the student re-
sponse willibe better than that of last year. It has been
pointed out in recent articles in the Pitt News that Pitt-
with better than 5,000 full-time students——collected less than
$2,800 last year. This meant a per capita contribution of 56

‘ cents per student. While we were doing such a poor job,
Tech and Chatham were collecting $1.39 and $2.00 per.

. capita, respectively. I

_ With this in mind, this year’s Pitt Chest Committee has
"set $1.50 per student as their goal. The money collected will
help to support 16 major charities which include——among
others-Care, Polio, and United Fund. Of importance also
are included such organizations as the World University
Service (help to needy students) and the Loan Fund
WSGA’s and Men’s Council fund for emergency use for the
student. »

The importance of giving to this drive should not have
to be mentioned. Perhaps if the student for a moment would
put himself in the position‘of needing to receive this money
instead of being able to give it, the picture would become a
little clearer to him. It certainly would be a shame to fall
down on the job two years in a row. V

A Timely A Tallr  
Council of Scholastic Organizations has expanded its

program to include a number of cultural events this year.
The organization is composed of two delegates from

each of the fourteen scholastic honoraries on the University '

L campus. The group includes only the scholastic achieve-

ment fraternities such as Phi Eta Sigma, John Marshall,“

-Pi Tau Phi, etc.

Sponsorship of the annual Scholars’ Day ceremonies is
the major project undertaken by the organization. But‘ the
sponsorship of this Day which honors those in the Univer-
sity who have made outstanding achievements in the aca-

In Defense ‘Of Nixon

By Harold Jacobs

If an award were given for consistent ability
to beat off attackers, Richard M. Nixon would be
the leading candidate.

Whatever the derogatory charge, Vice-President
Nixon successfully casts off the narrow-minded
whip-lashers to emerge stronger than before. Un-
flinching endurance in the race of challenge is an
admirable trait. No one can take
this away from him.

In pursuing the truth in the
Alger Hiss case, Mr. Nixon faced
opposition from a large segment
of the press corps as well as in-
difference from many influential
government leaders. It will be
recalled that former President
Truman referred to the whole
affair as “a red herring” and
even now hasn’t reconciled himself to the guilty
decision (on ‘perjury count) given by the jury. It
cannot be denied that the eventual conviction was
a victory for Nixon.

Another vicious assault that evaporated after
Nixon met it head-on concerned the 1952 expense
fund controversy. Indications are that the Amer-
ican people felt he justified himself.

More Charges Destroyed

Last Monday Pitt students were treated to an-
other lambasting of Nixon. These charges reveal
some loose thinking and need to be examined fur-
ther.

It was inferred that Nixon is both anti-Semite
and anti-Negro because he signed a lease with a
restrictive clause. This turns out to be just a lot
of emotional noise. First, the evidence is far from
sufficient to establish the charge. It would be just
as foolish to suppose Truman a Communist be-
cause he could never bring himself to believe that
Alger I-liss was guilty. Absurd, isn’t it?

Second, restrictive clauses are usually inserted

. by the seller, not the buyer. There have been cases

in the Supreme Court declaring them unconstitu-
tional, and there is reason to assert that this par-
ticular one would be declared unconstitutional if
tested in the courts. ’

Third, if isolated -bits of evidence are sufficient
to make sweeping conclusions, as was done by Mr.
Rothman, it might be concluded that Nixon is de-
ﬁnitely not anti—Semitic because he recently chang-
ed hotel reservations when he discovered the

original hotel practiced discrimination.

Nixon An Asset

Another charge passed off last Monday suggests
that nothing favorable can be found in Nixon’s
views or accomplishments. However, President Eis-
enhower identiﬁes Nixon very strongly with “the
New Republicanism.” After much disagreement,
practically all Republicans now regard Nixon as a
continually rising asset, partly because he contri-
buted “something of himself” to the Republican
program and to the campaign. How then can his
views be tagged “indeterminate and perhaps non-
existent?” In the area of accomplishments, there’s
little doubt that Nixon has been the most active
and influential Vice-Presideht in United States
history.

One comment on the Israel-Egypt dispute is
appropriate. Ike appears to be very deﬁnite‘ in his
avowals (1) that force is not the method to be
used in settling disputes, (2) that Israel, France,
and Britain have erred, and (3) that the United
States will not enter into the ﬁghting. Stevenson

' makes charges of “blundering,” but he is vague in

pinpointing administration mistakes and suggest-
ing a constructive course of action. Is this too much
to expect of a supposed leader?

 

Team. Neither

Time For A Change

By Irv Rothman

President Eisenhower stated in a non-political
speech last Thursday night that the United States
would steer clear of “involvement” in Middle East
ﬁghting. But having no doubt insured himself many
votes by the obvious, he failed to present to the
American people the fact that the United States is
very much involved in the Middle East develop-
ments.

It may be that Eisenhower has
failed to recognize that the vacil-
lating opinions and strategy of
the Dulles “missile” have pre-
vented the United States from
having any real inﬂuence over

,the participating powers.

Certainly it is difficult to be-
lieve that with ambassadors in
England and France and diplo-

matic representatives in Egypt and Israel, the United ,

States and the President could'not have known
the true developments in the Middle East nor have
sought to prevent them.

Nasser's Moves

Of one thing we can be sure—the administra_- "

tion grossly underestimated the impact of Nasser’s
moves upon our British-French allies and the
State of Israel. .

But underestimation is one of the more promi-
nent traits of the present Republican administration.

The Secretary of Health, Education, and Wel-
fare underestimated the great demand for the Salk
Vaccine‘ when it was declared successful; so gov-
ernment machinery was neither ready to properly
distribute it nor to assure its safe production.

The government underestimated the beneﬁcial
effects of the Tennessee Valley authority and tried

. - to push private power enterprise into that area

through an underhanded Dixon-Yates contract, un-
til such tactics were exposed.

The government has underestimated the intelli-

gence of the Russian government, and so has con-

V

W.

tinued massive production of arms while Russia '

gains its ends through economic assistance—a tactic
we had originally used successfully.

And the government underestimated the will of
free peoples throughout the world when it claimed
the world was at peace within -weeks before
Hungary and Poland revolted ‘against their Russian
oppressors. ’

Government Unsuccessful

But it is not diﬁicult to realize why the govern-
ment is so unsuccessful as an estimator of the world
scene. President Eisenhower is just not informed
and therefore is incapable of knowing the basic
problems so that he may offer basic leadership
in solving them.

Asked whether he thought Iceland was still /0

valuable to the NATO alliance, Ike said “I haven’t
given . . my personal attention to a study of the
proposition . . . ” When asked why Republican
leaders failed to bring to the House legislation for
economic relief to depressed areas in 15 states, Ike
replied “. . . you are telling me something now that
I didn’t know.” Asked whether the Navy would
continue to visit ports where crews must submit to
segregation, Ike replied “I don’t know.” The list is
a long one that shows lke’s ignorance of foreign
and domestic issues. ,

The Republican administration has been carry-
ing on a great deception. It is obvious that lke’s
smile, as sincere as he may be, cannot hide the
unsmiling facts of waning United States prestige in

the world caused through ignorance and compla- 

cency.

There is need for a change and Stevenson is the
man with enough courage to take the leadership
to bring it about. 0

Letters tothe Editor

Editor, the Pitt News:

Through a recent political
science project, this student has
had the splendid experience of
interviewing Mr. Eric Hass,
Presidential candidate of the So-
cialist Labor Party. In order to
supplement the other political
ideas presented in the Pitt News,

I submit the following: —
The Socialist Labor Party is
the only party of Socialism.
There may be other organiza-
tions paying lip-service to So-
cialism. But these are, in es-

sence, reform outﬁts. True So-
cialism demands the abolition of
Capitalism_-— not its reforma-
tion! Why? When one under-
stands that Capitalism is the
basic cause of wars, depressions,
and a multitude of other evils,
then the need —— the dire need-
of abolishing Capitalism be-
comes obvious. In place of out-
moded Capitalism, with its po-
litical state, will be the Socialist
Industrial Republic, based
squarely upon industry, not up-
0 n meaningless geographical

Pitt Chest

Part of Funds Go
To Loan Services

For MC, WSGA

By MURRAY A. CHASS
“From those who have to
those who need” is the slogan
of the Pitt Chest. Students in
foreign countries, though, are
not the only ones who “need.”

At one time or another a num-

ber of students right here at Pitt,
both male and female, ﬁnd them-

  selves with money problems.

 They must turn to someone for
., ielp. Two recipients of Chest
‘funds, the Loan Funds of Men’s
Council and Women’s Self Gov-
ernment Association, give this
important aid to these co—eds who
_are faced with such emergencies.
Men’s Council Loan Fund,
whose lone source of income is
the Chest, lends. money to un-
dergraduate men mainly for
emergency situations. The Loan.
Fund, started in the mid-1940’s,

originally depended on proﬁts —

received by Men’s Council’s

CHEERS for the Pitt Chest campaign are being given by the
beneﬁciaries of the drive in the cartoon above. The fund, which
has a goal this year of $3500, contributes to the charities shown
and to many more including the World University Service.

Chest accepted the responsibility
of supporting the Fund.
Last year a total of $587.50 was
received from the Chest.

‘The sister organization of this,
the Loan Fund of WSGA, works
much the same way although its
funds are available for tuition,
books, or emergencies rather
than just the latter. Sums up to
$150 are lent to undergraduate
women. From the 1955 drive,
the women’s fund was presented
with $235, or 10 per cent.

The ﬁnal 33 per cent of 51956
Pitt Chest funds will be divided

among the United Fund of Alle-
gheny County, the National Polio
Foundation, and CARE, with the
United Fund receiving theilargest
contribution.

Since Dr. Jonas Salk perform-
ed his now famous work with
polio vaccines here, men and
women at the University should
especially be interested in help-
ing the Polio Foundation.

Actually, the Pitt Chest can be
called the forerunner of the local
United Fund on a minor scale, for
Pitt students saw the need for a
single collection instead of num-
erous ones ten years ago.

LANGUAGE MADE SIMPLE: No. 1

In this day of swift international communications,
like radio, television, and the raft, it becomes increasingly

‘important for all of us to have a solid groundingin

foreign languages. Accordingly, I have asked the makers
of Philip Morris whether I might not occasionally forego
levity in this column and instead use it for a short lesson
in language.

“Of course, silly!” chuckled the makers, tousling my

yellow hair. Oh, grand men they are, the makers of _

Philip Morris, just as full of natural goodness as the
cigarettes they make. “Of course, fondboy, you may
occasionally forego levity in this column and instead use

_ it for a short lesson in language!” said the makers and

tossed me up and down in a blanket until, rosy with
laughing, I bade them desist, and then we all had basins
of farina and smoked Philip Morrises and sang songs
until the ‘campfire hadvturned to embers.

For our ﬁrst lesson in language, let us take up
French, which has often been called the lingua franca.
of France. We will approach French in a new manner,
because, to be brutally frank, the way it is taught in our
colleges is archaic and obsolete. Why all this emphasis
on grammar? After all, when we get to France does it
matter if we can parse and conjugate? Of course not!

So for the ﬁrst exercise, translate the following real,
true-to-life dialogue between two real, true-to—lif,e French-
men named Claude (pronounced Clolzd) and Pierre (also
pronounced Clohd) :

CLAUDE: Good morning, sir. Can you direct me to
the nearest monk?

PIERRE: I have regret, but I am a stranger here
myself.

CLAUDE: Is it that you come‘ from the France?
PIERRE: You have right.
CLAUDE: I also. Come, let us mount the airplane
and return ourselves to the France.
PIERRE: We must defend from smoking until the
airplane raises itself.
CLAUDE: Ah, now it has raised itself. Will you have
a Philippe Maurice?
PIERRE: Mercy.
CLAUDE: In the garden of my aunt it makes warm
in the summer and cold in the winter.
PIERRE: What a coincidence. In the garden of my
aunt too!
CLAUDE: Ah, we are landing. Regard how the air-
plane depresses itself.
PIERRE: What shall you do in the France?
CLAUDE: I shall make a promenade and see various
sights of cultural and.historica1 signiﬁcance. What shall
you do?
PIERRE: I think I shall try to pick up the stewardess.
CLAUDE: Long live the France!

Clip Call Nullifies

'Walton’s Long Run

The “new look” Panthers
almost had that “magic touch”
last Saturday afternoon at
Minnesota. That old black

magic in the form of one-yard line
jitters and give-away fumbles
forced the Jungle Cats to take the
back seat in the 9-6 contest.

A homecoming crowd of 63,000
fans watched the _OaklanderS
punch holes in the Gopher line on
two long drives in the ﬁrst half
only to be stopped on the one-yard
line. .

The ﬁrst drive started on the
Panther 43-yard line with Jim
Theodore, Corky Cost, and Ralph
Jelic grinding out yardage to the
Minnesota 17 before Corny Sal-
vaterra threw his first pass to Joe
Walton on the seven-yard marker.

End Zone Pass Fails

On the next three -plays, the
Jungle Cats moved the ball down
‘to the one-yard line.
fourth down and one, the eager-
ness of the Panthers set them back
ﬁve yards to end the threat with
an incompleted pass in the end

- 20118.

“If you at ﬁrst don’t succeed,
try, try again,” is Coach John
Michelosen’s favorite quotation.
Early in the second quarter, the
Oaklanders made their second
bid.

After recovering a Gopher fum-
ble on their own‘ 49-yard line,
Jelic returned the favor, but Cost
picked the ball out of mid air and
rambled for nine yards before the
Minnesota team could locate the
ball.

Salvaterra Fumbles

With the ground attack stalled
on the 20, Salvaterra took to the
air on third down and eight yards
to go with a pass to Walton on the
10-yard line for another ﬁrst-and-
ten. . ' ‘

Tom Jenkins and Theddore
moved the ball to the four—yard
-line before Salvaterra crossed

‘ the goal line on a keep only to

have the ball knocked out of his
hands and recovered by Bob
Cox on the one-yard marker.

With the ball on their own one,
the Gophers could only dent tkt
Panther forward wall for ﬁve
yards in two plays. On third
down, grim Minnesota fans gave
asigh of relief as the Big Ten of-
ﬁcials called the Oaklanders oﬁ—
side to give Quarterback Cox more

Losing Ills, 4-1

Two was the “magic” number,
Friday, gas -the Panther booters
ended a three game ,losing streak
against North Carolina State, 4-1.

For the second time this season
Panther center forward Sam
Hazou, a_ native Jordanian, scored
two goals; the win was ‘the locals’
second of the season; and it gave
the Oaklande-rs a perfect two-for-
two mark at home.

In bringing their 1956 record
to 2-3-1, the Panthers scored
,one goal in each period and
were never in any serious dan-
ger of losing. ' '

Coach Leo Bemis was pleased
with his team’s performance. “The
fellows hustled more than at any
time this season,” he commented.
“The halfbacks were more ag-
gressive and the line passed much
more than it has in previous
games. North Carolina State had a
good defense, but we were able to

Gophers Officially ‘
Scuttle Panthers

By STEVE BUTCHOCK
Sports Editor

 
       

 

The Minnesdta Gophers led the Panther gridders, 9-6, in the
fading minutes of the game, Saturday, when Al1—America end candi-
date Joe Walton grabbed the kickoff following Minnesota’s ﬁeld goal
on the 23-yard line.

Walton, jersey numerals obliterated by dirt, angled for midﬁeld
where the wedge was forming and the Blue and Gold linemen were
hurling desperation blocks at the charging Gophers. Suddenly the
two lines made contact as players began tumbling with thuds to the

“-4

. turf. Walton kept going.

’ The converted All-State fullback, cut diagonally across the
ﬁeld at the midﬁeld marker and angled for the right sideline,
always looking back for a teammate so he could lateral the ball.
The only thing he could see were Gophers rapidly closing in
on’ him. At this moment you wouldn’t have given a counterfeit
nickel for Joey’s chance of going all the way. The big end out-
maneuvered the Minnesota defenders, however, and scored the
potential winning touchdown.

Black on the Panther 43-yard line there was a ﬂag. It didn't
take vmuch to ﬁgure the reason. When Walton broke into the clear
the only thing that could save Minnesota was a ﬂag. The players‘
knew it and the fans knew it. Maybe the oiﬁcials even sensed it.
Nevertheless, the ﬂag was down—.—and the Panthers went down
with it. i E

The Jungle Cat players ﬁgured they got the “shaft” ongthe call» .
When they questioned the oﬁicial as to which player committed the V“
clip, he signaled that he didn’t know. Coach John Michelosen said
the penalty was called on. Vince Sorsone. “He hit him right.in the
stomach with his head and _alrnost got knocked out,” stated the de-*
jected Panther coach. Michelosen is one coach that will never con-
dem an official in public, no matter how bad the call is against his
team. But judging from his remarks you could easily ﬁgure out
that he wasn’t happy about the call. I

pack in front in the ﬁrst quarter,
the Oakland soccerites took com-
plete control. Bob Murdock, out-
side right, tied the game up, and
then Hazou, _ leading Panther
scorer‘, won it with his second and
third quarter scores.

The play of a pair of sophomores ’
came as a pleasant surprise to
Bemis. One was Lee Goodman,
Playing at inside right, Goodman
accounted for the Panthers’ ﬁnal
marker midway through the last
period on a ten-yard kick. The
other, Ron Goga, was in goal for \
most of the contest, and the losers
failed» to score .on him.
