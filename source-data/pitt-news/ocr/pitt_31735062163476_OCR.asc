Amendment Passage
f VVill Free Finances e
To Back New Loans

The passage of Amendment 1-A to Pennsy1van'i_a’s constitu-
tion will free $425,000___to back student loans through private
lending institution. _ -

' It is estimated that this initial appropriation through the
newly established Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance
' Agency may generate loans amounting to as much as $5 million
once the program is in full "swing.

According to Dr. Alan C. Rankin, assistant chancellor of
student and general- affairs, “Many students should beneﬁt, insti-
tutions of higher learning should benefit, and the state of Penn-
sylvania should benefit. by "helping to educate a greater number
of its students with potential for. higher learning.” »

Aid Students

The‘ amendment will allow many students alreadyuin college
to continue their education, which they might not have other-
wise been able to ‘do, explained Jack Critchﬁeld, Director of

Student Aid. _ '

A Even more important, Critchﬁeld feels, it will encourage
many qualiﬁed high school students to plan on college, who

‘ previously would not have even ‘considered it because of
ﬁnancial ‘inability.’ ‘

Specifically for the University, besides reducing the drop-out
problem due to insufficient funds, Everard Pinneo, Director of
Admissions, indicated that it will allow the University to grant
more loans and scholarships to incoming freshmen, provided»
upperclassmen are able to borrowunder the new amendment at A
comparable rates to those of the University loan program.

- U 0 -One Drawback

The ‘one drawback in the program, according to ‘Pinneo, is
that at present the scholarships and loans provided will not be
available to incoming freshmen, but “our hope is that this re-
striction will be lifted in the early stages of the program.”

Dr. Rankin commented on the University’s«. reaction to the
passage of the amendment that “we have recognized a need for
a state student loan program for a number of years, due to the‘
fact that the University has been unable to provide enough loan
assistance to help perspective freshmen to begin their college.

“The Pleasures of Learning.”

White is the British author of
The Once and Future King upon
which the Broadway show “Cam-

“The Pleasure of Learning,” ac-
cording to White, “is mostly about
myself. In the ﬁrst place I like
doing things, and I do them for
their own sake, not for ‘copy.’
In the second place, I do try to
verify and master my statementii
like a scholar _— i.e. before say-
ing that a knight in armour way
like a cleep—sea diver, I had been
down in the old fashioned diving .

White said that “behind my
facade as a wage-earning‘ novel-
ist there has‘ persisted for as
long as I can remember a gen-'
uine passion for learning; not
only for reading history or
translating medieval Latin, but.
for learning‘ to ﬂy airplanes, or
catch salmon--or train falcons or
plow with horses or fence with
foils or paint pictures or for
anything else which needs "the
lovely effort of learning.”

Monday, November 11, 1963

a November 22 appearance. Comedian Dick Gregory, vocalist .

Margie McCoy, and jazz pianist Vince Guaraldi are billed
for the two and a half hour show at Soldier and Sailors

Raised on relief in St. Louis,
Gregory acquired a sense of hu-
mor early. Shame at the sight
of the relief truck distributing
food was met with:: “Does every-
body get such service?” When
the family complained‘ of poverty:
“We’re broke, not poor. There’s
a difference.” _’

Margie McCoy, like Gregory,
began her career in a different
ﬁeld from the one she now prac-
tices. Miss McCoy ended her

‘dental back injury. Early in 1962,
she studied singing with Sandy
Oliver — the vocal coach of Lena
Horne, Joanie Sommers, a nd
other female jazz vocalists.

Miss McCoy then began her
new singing career in San Fran-
cisco at. McGowan’s West. This
was followed by an extended stay
at the hungry i, where she ﬁrst
appeared with _Gregory.

The musician of the show,
-Vince Guaraldi,- received his
jazz education from a variety of
sources--boogie woogie _records,
San, Francisco State College, the
Army, and jam sessions. Guar-
aldi is one of the few jazz mu-
sicians who have had a national
hit record. ,

“It’s a wild feeling,” says Guar-
aldi, ‘‘It’s like building a rocket
in your cellar and watching your
_. tie in its tail when it goes off!”
" Actually it took Guaraldi ﬁve
years and an accident to get
j, “Cast Your Fate to the Wind”
‘released as a single record. The
song‘ was put on the “B” side
of a 45 for the‘ simple reason that
it was the ideal length.

Tickets for ‘the November 22
show are available at special rate
of $1.75 to all University students,
faculty, and staff. General ticket
price for all others is $2.75. Tick-
ets are available at the SU and
CL student desks, Book Store, and
Joseph Horne’s Department Store.

This is that interesting time of the yearwhen the travel bug begins to weave his
magic spell over the student. The trimester has reached the midpoint and mid—terms are
a thing of the past.- At such a point in -the year "a general feeling of being walled in forever
overtakes the student and he longs to get away from the University picture. Maybe not a
week’s vacation to some exotic playland-in the south seas, but just a two day leave of aca-
demic absence or even a 24 hours jaunt to a ‘metropolitan hideaway. ‘If per-chance some of

I’ll just concern myself with

“How to Succeed in Business

Moving down the rung of the
Broadway ladder, I come to last
season's holdovers which con-
stitute a very small group. The
first of these is “A Funny Thing
Happened on the Way to the
Forum,” starring Zero Mostel.
I have been informed that Mr.
Mostel’s contract is coming to
an end and he will not renew.
Therefore I would ‘tell future
travellers to get on.their horses

.and write the Alvin Theatre.
‘ The show is in the great tradi-
tion of slapstick and burlesque
and no holds are barred. The
songs and costumes are well
created as are the girls in the
chorus. Plot deals with Ancient
Rome and a slave who tries to
gain his freedom. Mostel, all
300 pounds of him, is in great
form and he and _his aides help,
make the show hilarious from
opening to closing curtains. d

If you saw “Stop the ,World”
when it played at the Nixon this
year I would advise you not to
see the Broadway version since it
is the same company that appear-

they have replaced Anthony New-

highly original and unusual and
represents a different kind of

Last week, however, Interfraternity Council decided that such a project would
be a worthwhile one for the group to tackle, and announced its intentions to come

bout with an evalution booklet for the fall term of 1964. _
The booklet will deal with teaching methods, and_ course requirements in addi-

I tion to evalutions of speciﬁc courses. We would hope that in addition to advising stu-
dents from taking courses of little value or ones taught by inept professors,'the book- -

let will also push those courses and professors which offer real stimulation and en-

. lightenment. A course is not necessarily poor just because it requires a 30 page term
I; ,- paper. Some of the best are also the hardest. ‘ '

_, -The project, nevertheless, is a gigantic undertaking, and IF must be congratul-

. ated for its willingness to assume the responsibility for the publication. This is probably
the single most important project which any student organization has undertaken in.
the past few years. . _ , _

' Mark Bebko, president of IF, stated that at this point the project will be handled

K I- exclusively by fraternity members due toitheir avalibility, but that he hopes that as
‘  the-booklet begins to take shape, he wlil receive assistance from students outside the
system. It is ourjcontention that every student organization‘ on campus should offer its .

I services, in whatever capacity IF wishes to use them, for the publication of the book-
let. - _
If the ﬁrst issue is going to be ready in time for students to be able to make use

I I of its evaluations for next fall, a great deal ‘of work will have to be done in -the near

future. Such a publication cannot be a slipshod

to trust in its evaluations.

. Inquiry not Inquest

By Bernie Trufmpower 

With reference to the upcoming Forum Series, it
needs to be pointed out to both students and Dean Rush,
and dictated perhaps to some, that we as students are
not preparing to conducta public lynching ofthe Dean

of Students. We are expected to conduct an intelligent’

inquiry into the nature -of the role of
the Dean of Students-Dean of Women.
Remember that. Inquiry; Not Inquest.
Both students andadministrators have
a responsibility, if"no other, to see that
there is not a waste of good coﬁee.

to ask speciﬁc questions which will shed
light on functions of the Dean of Stu-
dents which up‘ until this time have
been termed “hard to ﬁnd out about,”

and “shady.” The questions should not‘ ‘

be of the nature,” Dean Rush, what do you deﬁne as a
mature woman, when you call us women and treat us
like girls.” The questions is asininely glib, and would
rightfully receive an asininely, glib answer. ‘

, If the students want to know", why the dean took~_a
certain action, then let, that student be free to ask about
that. “Dean Rush, isn’t is possible that you may be
prejudiced,” will not be an extremely enlightening ques-
tion. A better one would be, “Have you ever taken it
upon yourself to advise a coed withjregards to inter-
racial dating?” If the questioning is this ‘speciﬁc, the
answers she gives may Well: open some minds‘; ‘possibly
prejudice will’ be replaced by fact. ' —

  Mike Marcuse, in’ the role'of coordinator of the pro-
.'gram,'has the responsibility of maintaining a rational
tone of questioning, while at the same time he should

__ provide a means by which students may submit ques- '

‘ tions in lieu of their absence. This will curtail the foot-
stomping and at the same ‘time. offer afeeling of secur-

-: Dean Rush must answerin truth. This requires that

I she display sound faith‘ in her ability to function in her

oﬁice, she must be. equipped with answers backed by

" fact, not by ideals. She ‘must not look down upon‘her v
- audience, but at the same time she must recognize an

inquisitive mind. She must not havethe attitude that
she is speaking in her defense,’ but rather she must know
that there exists among the student body prejudiced at-
titudes toward her as an administrator which only she

' can dispell.
I = " ‘ She .must meet speciﬁc questions with speciﬁc-an-

'swers,’otherwise she runs the risk of appearing as the
Baptist minister who preaches the salvation of humanity
“while neglecting his bedridden son. The students do

 not want to see the colors of her ﬂag, instead they ask

that she show them the soles of her boots.

If these conditions are met —"— if students and ad-
ministrators display mutual respect, conduct a revealing
question and answer period, then Dean Rush will either
fortify her position as a competent dean, for which she
will command respect, or she will reveal herself as a
person with limited capabilities. To a growing number

Superstitutious readers please ﬁnd some
wood. For what is about to be put down here
will have you knocking loud and long. One of
the biggest factors in the success of the Panther

_ football team this year
has been the almost total
absence of injuries.

Perhaps it. has been
just plain luck, or it may
be due to the strict pro-
gram of exercises initi-

Wiechec, but the fact re-
mains that the Panther
starting lineup has re-
mained in tact for the
- ﬁrst seven games.

The only injury of a serious nature that has

 

occurred this season is to end Bob Long. Even‘

Long’s injury turned out better than was ex-
pected. Long was running with the ﬁrst team
in pre-season’ drills when he hurt his knee.
Coach John Michelosen said on more than one
occasion that he felt Long was ﬁnished for the

ated by trainer Frank"

year. Long, however, was back in the lineup for
the West Virginia game.

An injury in practice the following week
has sidelined Long since then, but by that time
he was demoted to the third -team.

Pre-season injuries to Ray Popp’ and Paul
Cercel knocked them off the ﬁrst team, but
they have not missed any games and have run
with the second unit all season.

The only player on the ﬁrst two teams to
miss any game time due to injuries is John
Telesky. Telesky shared the second unit full-
back job with Barry McKnight in the. West
Virginia game, but was in the game when the
Panthers needed him._ 1 ' _

The lack of injuries has to deserve a major
portion of the credit for the team’s success thus
far. This is a great deal of depth on the squad,

but there are also certain key men that the

team cannot afford to lose. r

Bod Roeder is no Paul Martha, Kenny Lucas
is no Fred Mazurek ami Ron Linaburg is no
Ernie Borghetti. _

A rash of injuries to the Panthers, similar

to the bad luck that has hit Penn State this year
could be trouble for Michelosen. Fortunately,
the Panthers have something going for them

this season.
as a: :0:

Michelosen’s plan to take the team to a se-
cluded spot the night before each away game
backﬁred at Notre Dame. The team stayed at
Elkhart, Indiana some 20 miles out of. South
Bend on Friday night.

The biggest football game of the Indiana
high school season was played in Elkhart_ Fri-
day night. The home team won, so after the
game their were speeches, a parade and much
horn-honking. The noise lasted until early in
the morning‘. The noise,.however, did not have
any effect on the players as their performance
the next afternoon indicated. ' '

Other than that the hospitality shown by
the Notre Dame people was extraordinary.
They even had a police escort for the team
bus going from Elkhart to the game and from
the game to the airport.

 Panthers Stumble, But Still Rip Irish‘

Miscues Fail to Bother Gridders

  185 Notre Dame Falls Easily,27-7  

   

By BOB SMIZIK

SOUTH BEND, Ind. -4 Losing. the ball three
times on interceptions is enough to bring defeat
to any team, but the Panther gridders did just
that here Saturday and still managed to man-
handle Notre Dame, 27-7.

In between the interceptions Paul Martha
raced 92 yards with a kickoff return, Rick Lee-
son plunged one yard ----- ~ “ A‘
for another score fol-
lowing Eric Cra.btree’s
45-yard punt return,
Fred Mazurek ran 10-
yards fora touchdown
after a 40-yard Mazu-
rek to Martha pass,
and Kenny Lucas
passed six yards ‘to
Bill Howley for a
fourth touchdown.

Mazurek threw two _
in te r ceptions an d p Joe Kuzneski
,Martha one, but the.Irish could only capitalize
on Martha’s misguided aerial. End Harry Long

‘nabbed Martha’s intended pass for Joe Kuz-

  

neski to set up a 62-yard Notre Dame scoring /

drive in the first quarter.

Kuzneski came on to grab four passes and
take over the team lead in that department.

After A the interception Martha, Mazurek,
Leeson and a powerful Panther defense took
care of the Irish.

Lucas Sits Bench

Mazurek, who did all of the quarterbacking
for the ﬁrst three quarters as Lucas sat the
bench, led the Panthers in rushing with 42
yards and completed eight of 13 passes for 111
yards. ' I

In addition’ to his thrilling kickoff return,
Martha sparkled offensively and defensively all

day. He was wide open in the ﬁrst quarter, on .

the same playvthat later clicked for 40 yards,
but this time Mazurek underthrew him.
Martha also was credited with six tackles
for the day.
Leeson got the important yardagewhen the

Panthers needed it and threw the big block on .

Martha’s touchdown. According to coach John

Michelosen, “Rick_ got the outside man who was

the last one between Martha and the goal."
Borghetti Leads Defense ‘

It was the defense that actually was the de-
ciding factor for the Panthers. Ernie Borghetti
was credited with nine tackles for the day, and
John Maczuzak and Ray Popp each had seven.

The defensive backﬁeld, led by Glenn Lehner
and Martha, held Notre Dame to only 80 yards
passing and held all-America candidate Jim
Kelly to only three receptions for 34 yards.

Notre Dame ‘coach Hugh Devore gave the 2
oﬁficials credit for part of the Panthers’ defen- _

sive work. Devore-was _referring to a play early
in the ﬁnal period when Irish quarterback John
Huarte was charged with fumbling -the ball
while back to pass. The Irish were on the Pitt
33 at the time and were moving well.
‘ Was Poor Call _
Devore said,~ “It was_,a poor call. In my
mind there was no fumble on the play. It was
intentional grounding. If they’re going to call
them that way they ought to take intentional
grounding out of the rule book.”
Devore was so incensed over the call that
he stormed onto the ﬁeld to argue with the oﬂ"1-'

, cials, a move that cost Notre.Dame ﬁfteen yards.

Devore also had praise ‘for the, Panthers.

“They’re a real strong team, one of the best in x

the country. They have a lot of speed. That
was probably. the deciding factor. They got
loose on those two long returns.” .

faced w i t h a
close match but
ran poorly, be-
cause as coach    ._
C a r 1 R e e s Eichenlaub
stated, “They didn’t have enough

desire.” ‘ A
This lack of enthusiams has
plagued the harriers all year. Ac-_

  

 

cording to Rees, “This team is
one of the best we’ve had both

potential wise, and time wise, but
as a competitive squad this is
probably one of the most de-
ﬁcient I’ve coached."

- In view of the times of the
meet. it is conceivable that the
Panthers could have been the
victors if Dave Eichenlaub,
Steve Waslo, and Larry_Robin-
son could have at least equaled
past performances.

Actually only one Panther
turned in what could be consid-
ered a good performance. John
Bailey, as was expected, was the
best performer for the Panther
squad. Placing second he turned
in a time of 22:32 for what proved
to, be the ﬁfth best time of the
Schenley Park 4.2 mile course.

In spite of the wet course, the

.._1Viountaineers . made .th_e finest,

 

  

team effort ever on the_ Pan-
thers’ home track. Roger Meador
was the individual winner" with
a time of 22:23.5 which is the
third best of the course. Team-
mate Joe Kubic,_ placing third,
had the sixth best Schenley Park
time. The team spread was a
very good 40 seconds. Of the
ﬁrst six places the Mountaineers
captured ﬁve. -

According to coach Larry Ro-

manoski of West Virginia, “This '

was our best performance this
season. We shouldigo on to "cap-
ture the Southern Conference
title.”

The freshman meet between
the Panthers and West.Virginia
was canceled.

the varsity and frosh squads is

Tom Staab~Sets Shutout Markl

Goalie Tom Staab set a career shutout record Saturday
at Schenley Oval by scoring his seventh shutout in leading
the Panther soccer team to a 3-0 win over Lock Haven. Staab —.-...
broke the mark of six set by Ron Goga in 1956-57. ‘

Staab had some anxious moments near the end of the
game, especially when Lock Haven left halfback Ed Journey

slammed in a shot. But an in-9

  
   

direct kick was indicated, and a
pass to a teammate was thus
necessary for the score to count.

Frosh Soccer Team
Sports Future Star

By HARVEY SHIPKOVITZ

Soccer coach Leo Bemis has spent an entire season looking
for a replacement for Corky Cuthbert. Center forward Cuth-
bert became the most proliﬁc scorer in Panther soccer history
last year by hitting for 15 goals during the season and setting
a lifetime record of 32 goals. '

But Bemis “never really appreciated Cuthbert. - Although he
admired Cuthbert’s scoring ability he never really considered
him a complete soccer player.

Hoop Schedule
Flavored Wtith
Foreign Touch

By ART FLEISCHNER.

A The varsity basketball team
will add a touch of inter-na-
tional ﬁavor to ‘\their 24 game
schedule this season. They
host the Peru national basket-

ball team on January 7, in an
exhibition game.

The Peru team is making a 12-
game tour of the United States
sponsored by the National Basket-
ball Federation. Two days later
the teamwill play Penn State.

Following the opener at the
Field House against Fairﬁeld Uni-
versity, ‘the Panthers will play. in
the Steel Bowl. They open against
George Washington while Du-
quesne plays Westminster. The
two winners, usually Pitt and Du-
quesne, meet for the title the
nextnight. .

The Panthers will also play in
the Los Angeles Classic Decem-
-ber 27-29. UCLA is
with Pitt meeting the Trojans in
the opening round. Other teams

Illinois and West_Virginia.
Panther coach Bob Timmons
said that this year’s schedule is
rougher than last season’s.' The

only newteams on the sched_- ,.

’’ ule are Fairﬁeld, not exactly a
basketball power, and Wiscon-
sin / \' .

This year the Panthers ‘play

Syracuse and‘ Fordham _ away,

"while they played them at home

last season. This is, however,
compensated by the fact that they
are hosting Army and Temple,
two teams Pitt played away last
season.
Of their 24 games, the Pan-
thers play 11 at the Field House
They
play Miami of Ohio at Johns-
town on December 20.

As usual, Pitt plays a home and
away schedule with Penn State,
West Virginia, Westminster and
Carnegie Tech. This season they
will also play Syracuse twice.

Phi Epsilon Pi’s potent running game and tough defense
were too much for Pi Lambda.Phi as they walloped Pi Lam
for the Fraternity. A League Football’ championship, 26-6.

About the only consolation for Pi Lam was that they
broke Phi Ep’s scoreless string by scoring on a third quarter
pass from Carl DelVi1lagio to Fred Berlin.

V Aside from that, it was all Phié

continually picked up long gains

A heads up defense, which in-

down numerous others, stopped
Pi Lam every time they got a
drive going. .
The other intramural Leagues
aren’t coming along as well as
the A League. The winner of
the Fraternity B League is still
undecided.

Phi Kappa Theta is the only
undefeated team. Theta Chi and
Delta Tau Delta have tied twice
and the winner of that game will
play Pi Kappa Alpha to decide
the winner of the losers bracket.

- Law School Leads

The Independent League is in
the semi-final rounds with the
Law School juniors the top team
in the winners bracket. The
Lawyers defeated ATP, .14-0 last
week. Now ATP. has to play Delta
Iota Delta for ‘the right to meet
the Law School for the title. Delta
Iota Delta’s only loss came at the
hands of ,Varsity Hall, in the ﬁrst
round.

The Engineering League is
ﬂoundering around and it is
doubtful whether the league,
will finish, according to assist-
ant intramural‘ director Tom
Jones. '

“The Engineers have been hav-
ing trouble getting their games
ﬁnished because it gets dark so
early now and they can’t start
their games until almost ﬁve”
Jones said. “They’ve decided to
play their games on the week-
ends to try and’ ﬁnish the league.”

I WAS A TEEN-AGE SLIITE RULE

"In 9. recent learned journal (Playboy) the distinguished board
chairman (Ralph “Hot Lips” Sigafoos) of one of our most
important American industrial corporations (the Art‘ Mechan-
ical Dog Co.) wrote a trenchantarticle in which he pinpointed
our single most serious national problem: the lack of culture
among science graduates.

Let me -hastento state that Mr. Sigafoos’s article was in no
sense derogatory. He said emphatically that the science grad-
uate, what with his gruelling curriculum in physics, math, and
chemistry, can hardly be expected to find time to study the
arts too. What distresses Mr. Sigafoos——and, indeed, all of us-
is the lopsided result of today's science courses: graduates
who can build a. skyscraper but can’t compose 9. concerto; who
know Newton’s Third Law but not Beethoven’s Fourth Sym.

 

is lzﬁsiard Mzzlio/ht/y?€cz'£//Ki

phony; who are familiar with Fra.unhofer’s lines but not with
Shelley’s. "A
Mr. Sigafoos can ﬁnd no solution to this lamentable imbal-
ance.‘ I, however, believe there is one-and a very simple one. '
It is this: if students of science don’t have time to come to
the arts, then the arts must come to students of science.
For example, it would be a very easy thing to teach poetry

‘ and music right along with physics. Students, instead of being

called upon merely to recite, would instead be required to
rhyme their answers and set them to familiar tunes—like,. for
instance, the stirring Colonel Bogey M arch, —Thus recitations
would not only be chock-9.-block with important facts but
would, at the same time, expose the students to the aesthetic

delights of great poetry and music. Here, try it yourself. You

all know The Colonel Boge-y M arch. Come, sing along with me:

Physics

Is what we learn in class.

Emsleiu _ ,

Said energy is mass.

N cwton

I s Iaigh-fol-twin’

And Pascal's a rascal. So's Boyle.

Do you see how much more broadening, how much more up-
lifting it is to learn physics this way? Of course you do. What?
You want another chorus? By all means:

. Leg/den
He made the Leg/den jar.
' Trolley
He made the Trolley car.
Currie
Rode in a surrey _
And Diesel’s a weasel. So's Boyle.

Once the student has mastered The Colonel Bogey March,

he can go on to more complicated melodieslike Death and Trans-

- ﬁgusraliion, Sixteen Tons,’and Boo-Hoo.

And when the student, loaded not only with science but
with culture, leaves his classroom and lights his Marlboro
Cigarette, how much more he will enjoy that ﬁlter, that ﬂavor,
thatpack or box! Because there will no longer be 3. little voice

. . within him repeating that he is culturally a dolt. He will know

-_-know joyously—that,he is a complete man, a fulﬁlled man,
and he will bask and revel in the pleasure of his Marlboro as a
