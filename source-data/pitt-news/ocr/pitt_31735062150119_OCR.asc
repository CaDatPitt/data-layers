Football Weekend Shaves Off with Big Pep Rally . . . No Fourth Hour

The world’s biggest, noisiest, happiest foot-
ball weekend will be touched off on campus
today after the third hour by a Victory rally and
will ﬂare through tomorrow night’s thirteen
victory (yes, that’s what we said) dances at
our specially decorated fraternity houses.

After the third hourtoday, after the 11:30
bell is sounded, the entire student body will

ﬂood from all doors of the Cathedral and head‘

for Soldier’s- Memorial Hall. Ahead of the

whole 7000 students, will march the blue-coated

band, led by sparkling Betty Toddie, co-ed ma-

0 jor. Ahead‘ of"'the'band,' men’s and women’s

fraternities-sand the Independents. will wave

» great colored banners and hoist giant placards.

State College says they ha-ve the best college spirit

in the country. We’ll show them that for shouting,

yelling, prancing, screaming, and cheering no one in the

,,,whole of this crazy, cockeyed world can make more

1 noise, can cheer leader, yell longer, and shout strong-
; :er,than the Great Pitt Student Body.

‘ ~I1,[fear,£'Ye! Hear Ye! 

When the band opens the rally. and the thousands
of students rise all over the hall to pour forth all the
melody andlife of our school under the leadership of
the combined Glee Clubs and cheerleaders’ squad,
then we will show the world that Pitt has more spirit
than the other two tank teachers colleges in and
around the City of Pittsburgh.

Quiet Please . . . But Not too Quiet

Then sleek Ben Foote will extend his chairman's
gavel over the podium and call for order, and we
hope you don’t give it to him for at least another five
minutes. Stamping and yelling, singing and cheer-
ing, show Benno what you can really give for Good
Old U N I. .

After everybody. has calmed down, and the ban-
ners and placards have ceased rattling, Ben is going

. to announce the speakers. The ﬁrst speaker _is.to be

fog-voiced, funny-faced. “Senator” Gerald Ziskind.
who canbe counted on to get down on his hands and

knees" and rip sighs and groans from the audience,

who can be counted on to raise the whole student

body from its sitting position to one of a straining,
cheering, shouting, partisan football crowd.

After the “Senator” has wrung you dry, let Betty

Sapp of the demonstration block, make you ﬁghting
happy and give you that ﬁne, ﬁghting, oomphy touch
that a high spirited girl can put in you.
_ Then watch withwhat ‘spirit the student body
.g1‘eets,the,ir coach. Watch the whole crowd rise and
cheer long _and loud, whist1ing,_ and ‘shouting, when
Charley Bowser gets up to give the "main speech: Lis-
ten well to what this expert -will tell you and ask
you to do that the team ‘can win‘ tomorrow. Above
all show him that you think he and his team are the
real thing. That’s real school" spirit.

Afterethe shouting and the cheers have died, Jack
.Brady, D. J. Bailey, he of three—hat fame, and Dan
Mash will make you chuckle up? your sleeve, laugh
out loud, and even yell like all hell, with their melo-
dramatic farce. D. J. is the villain, Jack the heroine,
and Slappy Dan completes the triangle by pretending
to be the hero. The more you laugh, the happier
you’ll be. ' i A P " ~

Wild Bill Fitchko will call the members of the foot-
ball team to- the stage amid the tumult;-, cheers should
greet the boys who have the spirit, and they need
yours to help them win. - - ~ 

All through the rally, the frets and the GD,I’s"w‘i_n
sit apart ;and the give and take of -yells from'their
opposing forces will enliven still more the greatest
pep rally "of this, or any other year; Foote has ar-
ranged a demonstration of the "banners to be car--

Modern Language Department

Flooded with War Propaganda

By Lylian Vaughn

The busy eye of European pro-
paganda agent.s has not overlooked
the University.

The department of modern lan-
guages is being swamped with mag-
azines, booklets and pamphlets from
foreign countries—-principally Ger-
many.

From Munich, via Siberia, comes
Nazi propaganda. The mass of lit-
erature is topped by a set of pamph-
lets entitled “Americaen Views.”
The pamphlets are summaries of
talks in English made over German
shortwave radio. In general, the

Senior G-.r.idders

In honor of departing senior
members of the football team, Men’s

Council will sponsor a tea dance at

Hotel Schenley on December 2, from
3 to 5:30 o’clock. '
The senior gridders will act as

1 hosts at the dance, which will fea-

Wvin Ludwig, BA4l, chairman.

articles suggest that the Americans
remain strictly neutral, citing al-
legcd wrongs co1‘n::-iitted against the
Western Hemisphere by Allied pow-
ers and recounting German benevo-
lence and justice to conquered na-
tions. With the reviews comes a
series of cartoons depicting so-
called weakness and foolishness of
the British and German racial and
military superiority.

“Geist in der Zeit,’ or “The Spirit
of the Times,’ is written chieﬂy by
men who hold" advanced academic
degrees. Its appeal is intellectual,
expounding German culture with
articles on the artistic, scientiﬁc,
and military achievement of Ger-
man people.

Not all of the propaganda received
through the mails is pro-Nazi. A
group of. free-thinking Germans,
religious leaders, and general an-
tagonists of the Nazi regime who
have been forced to leave the coun-
try and who call themselves the
“Freedom party” also sends ma-
terial to the department. Their ar-
ticles generally denounce the acts

Finale

Block to Climax Year
With ‘Best Show Yet’

To top off another successful sea-
son, Pitt’s Demonstrations Block
plans to give a perfect perform-
ance at tomo-rrow’s game. This is
the hope of Bill Morton, C41, and
Betty Sapp, C42, co-managers of
the block.

“Barring bad weather, we hope
to excel the highlights of T.ech’s
game and to display great im-
pro-vcment of the showing made at
the Pitt-Nebraska game last Sat-
urday,” says Morton.

During the second quarter of
the Penn State game, the block
will form a “P-S” on a diagonal
field. While the Pitt Band forms
the outline of the state of Penn-
sylvania at the half, the same de-
sign will be arranged by the block
with a large “S” of white paper
occupying the center.

Student from Coventry Tells Story of Failure
To Contact Reilatives Trapped in Bombed    he   

Speaking so softly that it was
often difiicult to hear her, diminu-
tive Jean Tipson, part-time student
at the University, whose home is in
Coventry, England, explained that
she had received no answer to the
cable she sent her parents and two

sisters at home.

Tears crowded the eyes of the

. dark-haired young Englishwomafl
.» as she spoke other people and of

her home town which, several days
ago, suffered the worst aerial bom-
bardment inﬂicted on any city dur-
ing the war. . . ._
Her clear white -complexion, de-
void of cosmetics, and framedin
the ﬁlmy black veil she had tied
under her chin, reminds one, para-

.-ities in

doxically enough, of the famous
English skins mentioned in make-
up advertisements. .
A Jean came to America in May,
1939,. to spend her summer vaca-
tion, but at the outbreak of hostil-
September, her parents
wired her instructions to remain.

As far as air-raid protection is
concerned, Coventry has no sub-
ways, and special shelters had to be
hurriedly constructed out of the
many wine—cellars in the lower parts
of the city. ‘

Jean feels that, in" comparison to

g the letter she received from home,

the accountsvof the bomb devasta-
tion in American newspapers are
fairly accurate.

. Her parents’ failure to reply may
be due to the fact that communica-

_ tion is probably zdelayedi since‘ -ti;

catastrophe," Shae‘ Inentionedg. .- :
“Even. if-. the people in towns

I which are aerially besieged, doreach

an air.-raid shelter, thatis no assur-
ance that 'they-will not be killed.
The shelters are only protection

“There? is:.:.nothing. that ‘can ‘save

dence of censorship in the letters

State _tomorrow the meeting will have two points
of ‘E-dgniﬁcance.

First, there will be the fact that this is an--
otlier in a long and heated series. And heat is
not far from warmth.

. Secondly, tomorrow’s will be the last home
game of a season in which the first step has been
taken towards returning to the students their
share of the sport .

Six of the scheduled eight games will have
been played at the stadium. This, we feel, is
an important move in re-establishing Pitt foot-
ball as our leading spectator sport.

Two Books 
The Spanish Civil War

For Whom the Bells Toll, Ernest Hemingway

No man is an Iland, lntire of it Selfe; every mall
is a peace of the Continent, a part of the mamei if
a Clod bee washed away by the Sea, Europe is the
lesse, as well as if a Plromontorie were, as well as
if a Mannor of thy friends or of thine owne were:
any mans death diminishes me, because I am in-
volved in Mankinde; And therefore never send to
know for whom the bell tolls; It tolls for thee.

From these lines of John Donne, Ernest Heming-
way has taken the title for his latest book. He, like
T. S. Eliot, has reached back into Elizabethan meta-
physics for better words to apply to our World, a
world this time peopled with Spanish Loyalists.

Mr. Hemingway’s premise seems to be that if truth
is as Chekhov says, “Absolute and honest truth,” then
a dead man is not really dead until you club the life
out of him, starting at the face so that the blue goo
from his smashed eyes can attract the Spanish ﬂies in
the dusty sunshine. But this is not primarily a war
horror stoiy. Dead is dead. Ice is ice and all the
Mr. Heming-
way has a way of exhausting sensually every object
he sees, living or dead. But you can see it, and you
can smell it, too. The quite average human being is
a little relieved on ﬁnishing this book to be allowed to
settle back into his superﬁcial daily quota after be-
ing led around by the nose through 471 pages of
strenuous living.

Mr. Hemingway’s Side '

And now for Mr. Hemin.gway’s side. It’s a good
thing for many subway riders to be jerked out of their
inertia and to have their noses rubbed in “dung and
death.” (T. S. Eliot: Very applicable here.) In a
manner of speaking, if you can housebreak enough peo-
ple, you may have a pretty decent world. But you
can at least show them ugliness vicariously so that
when they see it in reality, they won’t faint.

And here Mr. Hemingway really shines. There‘s
work to be done, he says. There are revolutions to be
won or lost. There’s a time for love and there’s a
time for work. Jump into both with your feet kick-
ing until you’ve won or died. If you win, get up and
start kicking something else; the world is full of things
to be kicked.

So if you’re up to it, try stringing along with Rob-
ert Jordan in his four fast days with the Loyalists.
You’ll like his crop-headed guapa, Maria, who was
raped by the Fascists.
lovers, Pilar, a lot of woman with few scruples and
plenty of devotion to the cause. You can see the re-
freshingly pure minded Anselmo who lives and dies
an idealist. But everything for a cause. This is “a
book for a cause. Phillip Lee Crittenden Jr. '

The Great Crusade, Gustav Regler A

Hemingway “made—up” a great novel about the
Spanish Civil War; Gustav Regler has recorded in his
autobiographical novel, The Great Crusade,’ the raw
material that Hemingway has used.

Hemingway says in his preface to Regler’s book,
“But there are events which are so great that if a writer
has participated in them his obligation is to try to
write them truly rather than to assume the presump-
ion of altering them with invention. It is events of
this importance that have produced Reg1er’s book.”

Regler was a writer before the Spanish‘ War. He
had fought fascism at home in Germany. Then he
left. “He had attended his country’s universities, .but
he was suddenly ashamed to hold a degree given him
by inst-itutionsthat let a Gumbel, the exposer of foul
vehmic, be spat upon,Vthat drove out an Einstein, that
cut oﬁ the world reputation of its men of learning with
low epithets.”

He went to France and to Spain. As an anti-fascist

I he was commissar of the 12th International Brigade in

Spain. He fought with the brigades in. the heroic bat-
tles of Madrid until he was wounded. ‘That is the.con-
tent of the book: the battles around Madrid: and the
men who fought them.

The Story
Thebook tells of Regler, of the brigades’ Hungarian
General Lukasz, of German Doctor Werner Heilbrunn

.who helped organize and run the Brigade’s medical
corps, of Prussian Commander Hans, and of Italian

General Pacciardi. Regler writes the battles of the
brave German, Pslish, French, and Italian brigades:
the battle of Guadalajara and the Garibaldi brigade
and the suspense of the propaganda loudspeakers and
the Abyssinian Garibaldi who wanted “Commander, I
go cut Mussolinis’ throat now?”, the massacre of the
French by the Moors, an intense battle; and the stand
of Janek and the Polish Dombrowski brigade at Ar-
ganda, against the Moors.

The Spanish Civil War is now appreciated by the
Democracies, and their imperturbable leaders. Perhaps
you democrats had better catch up on your reading.

The book is all action. I read it straight through.
You can get it in the Alldred Room. J. deBenedictis.

Athens to Hollywood

By Charles Camarata

Having come, bag and baggage, down the long cor-
ridors of history from Egypt to Athens to Florence to
London, Paris, and Berlin, culture is now making a
hasty exit from the backdoors of Europe to America.
The direction of its journey is west. Historians tell us
this is so, and the increasing number of intellectual
refugees to this country proves it. This is as it should
be, for it embraces the basic tenets of “Go west, young
man, go west.”

We hypochondriacs of the human spirit View with
satisfaction the inevitable next-stop of culture in Hol-
lywood. We await the enchantment of Beethoven en-
riched with a few bars of “Beat Me Daddy.” The
prime ballerina of the ballet we will encore with
bravoes of “Take it off!” We will tune in on poets,
playwrights, and authors who will sings their staccato
muses like Walter Winchell and who will usually be
back in a ﬂash with some more trash. The books on
our shelves will be classics on the root stems of such
noises as gaga, nerts, and ﬂoozie.

And this is all as it should be, because if culture has
seen ﬁt to come to America, it is only cricket that we
should go along with it on a “bender” to Hollywood.
Let’s call those nasty people medieval who insist that
culture had better start back-tracking in a hurry.

You’ll meet the freest of free,

Dr. Ferguson Pens

Letter of Thanks
Editor, the Pitt News:

Not that the following is of any
great signiﬁcance, yet some there
may be who will be interested to
learn that the temporarily-disabled
professor is at last out of the hos-
pital, and hopes to take over at
least one of his classes by the end
of this week.

To those students who telephoned
their condolences, or who called in

person at the sick room, or whose .
entrance was barred by hard-

hearted nurses, or who. all too gen-
erously sent. ﬂowers and cigarettes,
or who remembered the patient
with greeting cards or notes, I con-
fess myself very grateful.

Despite the intelligent services of
ten nurses it was no great fun over
at the West Penn. It’s grand to be
at liberty once more.

professor of economics.

Pitt Battles Unbeaten
Penn State i11Stadium

.Con.tinued from page one
Nebraska ﬁght. Betting odds stand
9-8, and take your choice.
Of great importance in weighing
‘the possibility of a Pitt victory is
the condition of Edgar Jones, triple-
threat leit halfback. Jones retired
‘from last Saturday's struggle with
tan injured eye, and although he’s
A slated for active duty tomorrow, his
, passing eye may yet be impaired.

Should. he be unable to return to
his old post, Jack Stetler, the bril-
liant sophomore halfbacking ﬁnd,
will again perform Jones’s chores.
In any event, the shifty yearling
will see plenty of action.

The rest of the team will be the
same gang that started the Nebras-
‘ka-_ _enc_ounter. Every member of the
starting lineup saw action in the
10-.(}}[ ﬁasco at State-“Colllege last
year-. Seven men on: the ﬁeld at
the opening kickoff play their last
game at Pitt Stadium.

Captain Ted Konetsky, a grand
tackle ‘for three years, leads his

__ mates into the fray for the last
.time in the Oakland saucer. Tiger
" Jack Benz, his tackle colleague on
N the other side of the line, also makes
‘his last collegiate appearance in

Pitltsburgh .

Other starters playing. collegiate

roles here for the last time are end
Jack Goodridge, guard Rudy Gradi-
sek, quarterback Mike Sekela, half-
back Bobby Thurbon, and fullback
George Kracum.

An air of supreme conﬁdence pre-
vails at State College. The squad
is in good physical condition, and
hopes to take the Pitt game in stride.
In many races the last hurdle is the
toughest, and so it seems tor the
Lions.

The outstanding star in the Penn

jecki, all-American candidate. No
less than six backﬁeld men must
bear watching for State tomorrow:

-354 , jJ.§a_»n Garland
The ﬁrstinfa series of .' SFA con-

, certs was launched by Alton Jones,

noted pianist, Wednesday afternoon

 in the Foster memorial. ~

--Appearing for the first time in

3 Pittsburgh, the soloist chose a di-
1 versiﬁed program
' Chopin‘,-"Hay‘dn and: Field. In the
; Chopin B—Elat Minor piano Sonata,

of — Debussy,

Mr. Jone's"'disp1ayed' his technique

:» and ﬁne musical understanding and
_. t.emperament.

, V ‘ Possessing well-
rounded robust tones, he dazzled

 the audience with the brilliant Pres-
f to movement, and the widespread
§ chords of the familiar Marche Fune-

bre. In the Haydn Variations in F

; Minor, the artist showed a feathery

lightness in touch and the variations
were set off from each other with
clarity and skill.

Alton Jones played through this
program with brilliance, ﬁne dra-
matic power and tenderness which
won the immediate approval of the
audience. The pianist also gracious-
ly offered two encore numbers, a
Bolero by Casella and the familiar
Brahms Lullaby.

]Vows.iServico Makes Big Fish
Out of Little Onos in Pitt Pond

By William~ Ollis

Small town talk: “Yes, sir, Joe
became a college fella and got into
that exclusive Greek fraternity. I
knew he’d make good.” '

Or maybe: “Gra‘cie’s one of those
honorary battery captains of the
I-‘itt ROTC.’ ,

Whenever you do something here
at the University—join a fraternity,
become a,ROTC officer, serve. on a
dance committee, take part in a
play, or some other little thing——
the folks back home know about it
by way of the hometown paper. The
local newspaper gets the news in
the form of a publicity release from
the University News Service.

The service, directed iiby Robert
X. Graham, maintains a hometown
department which sends “out news
to all local papers in Pennsylvania,
Ohio, and any other district that is
the hometown of ,a,Pitt student.

1 Thus, the people in Library, Pa.,

V, read in the South Hills News that

“Grace _*McCombs, Library student,

 ,who is a senior in the School of Ed-

Sociulitoms . . .

It seems quite ﬁtting that we
should start off with an apology to
the Delta Tau‘ Delta fraternity. We
gave them good publicity, but just a
week too“ early. Tonight at a smoker
they will entertain the Phi Gam, Phi
Delt, Phi Ep, Phi Kap, and PiKA
pledges. Next Wednesday night,
pledges from all the other fraterni-
ties will. be guests at a Delt house

. It was one big night last
Monday at the Theta. Chi house

when the actives and pledges enter- ‘
Htained their parents at dinner. Even

though the house was over-ﬂowing
with people, they still found enough
room for two after-dinner speak-
ers: Endicott Batchelder, assistant
registrar, and Wayne Weaver, alum-
nus of Pitt and officer of the Theta
Chi national organization. . . .

Much credit certainly goes to
Lambda Chi Alpha for originating
the custom of entertaining orphans
at a football game, dinner, and par-
ty each fall. With the cooperation
of their alumnus, Judge Schramm
of the juvenile court, the Lambda
Chis have carried out this idea alone
for the past few years. This year
IF council adopted the plan and
several other fraternities aided the
boys in entertaining the orphan
children .

In an attempt to bring about closer
relations between the Pitt and Tech
chapters of Sigma Alpha Epsilon,
the boys of both have planned joint

ucation at the ‘University of Pitts-
burgh, has been appointed an hon-
orary cadet officer of the Pitt ROTC

' regiment.”

Out in Illinois, the natives know
that “George Gregg, Panther car-
toonist, Oak Parkstudent at the
University of Pittsburgh, was
pledged to Delta Tau Delta, nation-
al social fraternity recently. Gregg,
sophomore in the School of Business
Administration, is the son of" Mr.
and Mrs. George R. Gregg of 940
Linden avenue.” They read it in the
Oak Leaves, local weekly.

Length of‘ the hometown stories
varies with the importance of the
event the student "is participating in
or the position he has acquired.
Some stories are only a column-
inch long; others might be two or
three column spreads with pictures.

The stories are gathered and writ-
ten by ﬁve student assistants in the
News service oﬂice: Gee Skinner,
E41; Melissa Mae‘ Gilmore, C44;
Margaret Coulson, C42; William
Patrick, C41, and William Ollis,
C43.

Thaw H all Physicists Experiment with Theories

To Improve Status of Industrial Communities

By‘ Leonard Winograd

To the average University student
who knows little. about physics,
Thaw hall is a building where en-
gineers and pre-dents attend classes
because certain subjects taught
there are required for degrees. But
behind those grayiwallsjare things
more important than lectures, ex-
ams, and student experiments.

Thaw hall every day is the scene
of experiments “which  to im-
prove the life of every American.

The physicists, Whom we have all
pictured as absent-minded scientists
puttering around in their labora-
tories with" unk_nown ‘forces, are
really‘ active,” alert workers who
solve many  practical  problems.
Throughout the United States labor-
atories, like those at Thaw hall are
developing theories which are indis-
pensable to metallurgists and engi-
neers. ‘ ;,   -:f‘.;. __  ,—

The physicsWdepartment,, headed
by Dr. Elmer Hutchisson, is":-‘making
a special‘ effort to develbp those
ﬁelds of re_search which are useful
in the industrial community. A
“physics of metals” laboratory
headed “by Dr. C. S. Smith, instruc-
tor in physics, and Dr. -‘ :__l,Vli1lard
Manning, professor of phys'i_ps, has
been established to study the elec-
tronic structure of the metals and
alloys, «creep, internal friction and
the mechanism of solid state reac-
tions.

In the x-ray laboratory under Dr.
S. S. Sidhu, physicist in charge of
the co-operative x-ray laboratory,
metal castings are tested for defects,
complex compounds areidentiﬁed
by their crystal structures and ap-

In the spectroscopic laboratory,
directed by Dr. Mary E. Warga,
physicist in charge of the spectro-
scopic laboratory, new methods are
being developed for checking the
chemical specifications on certain
alloys and for obtaining “bird’s-
eye view” analyses of faulty mater-
ials, particularly alloys, to deter-
mine the cause of the faults.

The work -of Dr‘. A. G. VVorthing,
professor of physics, on the radia-
tion of energy from heated tungsten
ﬁlaments is internationally known.

In the nuclear physics laboratory,
headed by Dr. A. J. Allen, associate
professor of physics, in cooperation
with Dr. S. J. Simmons, senior re-
search fellow in physics, artificially
radioactive. elements are .-used as
tracers incorporated in certain com-
pounds. Then the reactions of these
compounds are followed by tracing
the “tagged” element.

experiments; it is an important part
