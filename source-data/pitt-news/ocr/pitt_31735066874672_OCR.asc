Trial Area

Expanded

Dr. Jonas E. Salk, director,
Virus Research Laboratory,
will carry ﬁeld trials on his
polio vaccine to thousands of
public, parochial, and private
school children in this area
next. week. \

New tests are being con-
ducted by Dr. Salk in order to
ﬁnd out more about how_it
acts in humans, how much is
necessary for highest immunity,
when is the best’ time for booster
shots, and if it is possible to re-
duce the number of innoculations
from three to two. 9‘

The new series of vaccine tests

children from kindergarten to
eighth grade and will require
the cooperation of 28 district
schools. Dr. Salk hopes to per-
fect a test whereby one drop of
blood from an individual will
tell if, and how much, vaccine
is needed to prevent polio.

Up to now he has innoculated
15,000 children. In nationwide
ﬁeld trials more than 425,000
children throughout the iU.S. have
received the vaccine shots. These
trials are being evaluated on a
national level and the results are
expected sometime in April.

Dr. Salk headed the research
team which developed the anti-
paralytic polio vaccine that is now
being called by his name.

ecome Reality
vRevised M.C.. Program Passed A
By Student Elections Committe

BY JACK OLENDER.

The idea for recognized‘ student political parties at Pitt
has run the gamut of student government organizations and
administrative oﬂices to realization. '

The Office of the Dean of Men and the Student Elections
Committee have okayed a revised Men’s Council proposal
which will permit political parties to operate in the spring»

Potential party organizers may obtain petitions for the
organization of their parties at the Dean of,Men’s Ofﬁce and
must return their petitions by Wednesday, Mar. 2, along
with a membership list of 200 names. They are also required

the purpose of their organization
in the petiti'on.
Dues Charged

Parties may charge membership
fees of any amount up to 25 cents,
if they wish to do so. Membership
will be for the spring semester
only, since parties will be. organ-
ized at the beginning of each
spring semester and disbanded ‘at
the end of it. 0

The major function of parties

will be the slating of candidates
for male student -government
positions. (There were sugges-
tions made in Men’s Council to
incorporate women into the
party plan, but the proposal, as
passed, applies only to men
office-seekers.) '

The party system will not pre-
vent individuals from running iii-
dependent of paigty organizations,
nor will it overrule any require-
ments of the government organi-
zations concerned that all candi-
dates must petition for their of-
fices individually. ,

Political activity will be al-
most entirely student activity
with the administration playing
only a minor role. To the Stu-
dent Election Committee will go
the task of administering regu-
lations for political parties. This
committee having a membership
of representatives and advisors
from the various student gov-
erning organizations in the Uni-
versity will regulate campaigns.
examine financial reports and
penalize violations.
‘ Men’s Council and the Dean of
Men’s Office will also have a voice
in party matters. According to
Jack Hardman,_ assistant to the
DOM and advisor to Men’s Coun-
cil which sponsored the proposal,
the administration will try to keep
hands off of party politics. a

Pittsburgh Honors Fitzgerald
At ‘Man- of -the -Year’ Banquet

A
T

By IRV ROTHMAN

Chancellor Rufus H. Fitzgerald celebrated a high point
in his career when he was lauded as Pittsburgh’s Man-of-

the-Year Monday, Jan. 31.

Approximately 700 business and civic leaders attended
' the annual Man-of-the-Year dinner at the Hotel William Penn
to climax “Chancellor Fitzgerald Day.”

When he was presented the award, the retiring head

others cited as Men-of-the-Year in
individual ﬁelds. He was awarded

for sports.
Other Pittsburghers received
commendations in the ﬁelds of

literature, entertainment," medi-
cine, science, human v relations,

of the University of Pittsburgh;

credited the “remarkable develop-
ment” at Pitt to “an active and
vigorous board of trustees with an
energetic president . . . who have
given themselves unselfishly and

'"loya1ly to create herea university

with_ high academic standards and
moral integrity.”
Team Play Emphasized

He dwelton the theme of “team
play” at the University -—— one
which he had been expressing
throughout the day to students
who offered him their congratula-
tions. Monday had been declared
“Chancellor Fitzgerald Day” by
Mayor Lawrence. The'chancellor’s

office was open all day to well-

yvishers. ‘

Dr. Fitzgerald told more than
forty members of student publi-
cations that he was only a “sym-
bol of this great university.” He
credited the outstanding “team
play of all parts of the univer-
sit y —-faculty, administration, J
and students” for enabling the
growth of this university.

At the evening banquet, he
enumerated five essentials in uni-
v e r s i t y administration: (1) a
strong faculty, (2) good students,
(3) beautiful campus and build-
ings, (4) a rich content in course,
and (5) signiﬁcant research.

Linked Pitt to City

The university’s top administra-
tor was singled out by 40 civic,
religious, and business leaders for
the award for “being instrumental
in effecting a partnership in which
city and the University joined
hands, as has been done perhaps
nowhere else in the country, link-
ing the university’s development
with that of Pittsburgh.”

Future progress, Dr. Fitzger-
ald said, “will be accomplished

A through intelligent planning and
education.’ -

During his ten years as Chan
cellor of the University, construc-
tion has been completed or begun
on five major buildings costing
over 26 million dollars: plans have
been completed on five more

valued at over ten million dollars,
and three new schools have been
added to the University’s educa-
tional curriculum.

DRESSLAR M. PRUETT expects to receive his B.S. in Industrial Engi-
neering this summer-frorn Oklahoma Agricultural and Mechanical Col-
lege at Stillwater, Okla. He is president of the local student branch of

A.I.I.E. Naturally, he is interested in selecting the best job opportunity

for a successful career based on his technical training.

Don Miller answers:

 

DONALD C. MILLER received his B.S. in Chemi-
cal Engineering from Ohio State University in June
1937. During the following month he started work
with the Organic Chemicals Department of Du Pont
at Deepwater Point, N. J. Since then he has received
and given many kinds of technical training. Today
Don Miller is a general superintendent at Du Pont’s
Chambers Works-—-well qualiﬁed to answer questions
about training programs for college men.

Training has many facets in a big ﬁrm like Du Pont, Dress,
and a great deal of thought has been given to make it truly
effective. We look upon training as a very important factor
in a man’s career. We think that the best way to train a col-
lege graduate is to give him a maximum of on-the-job. re-
sponsibility in a minimum length of time. That’s the general
guiding policy at Du” Pont, Dress.
Of course, each department varies this general policy to
suit its special needs. A new man being trained for produc-
tion supervision may ﬁrst spend a year or so in laboratory
or plant development Work. 01' he may spend his training
period as a plant operator. Thus a man obtains firsthand
knowledge of his process, and establishes a bond of mutual
respect with the men he’1lbe working with on his ﬁrst .major
assignment.
A young man interested in sales is often ﬁrst assigned to a
plant or laboratory dealing with the products he will later
. sell; or he may join a group of trainees to learn selling tech-
niques right from the start.

An engineer, chemist, or other technical graduate is usual-
ly chosen for a speciﬁc job within his major ﬁeld of study.

Such a man brings specialized knowledge and skill to his

job, and he is encouraged to put them to use promptly. But
at Du Pont his experiences on the job .are supplemented
with lectures, conferences and discussion groups. In a. very
real sense, new technical employees continue training in
their specialties after joining the Company. ' t ~
To sum it all up," Dress, Du Pont’s training program is
individualized to provide a new man with speciﬁc oppor-
tunities to learn from contacts with more experienced men.
‘The prime objective of Du ‘Pont training is always kept
clearly in mind———to develop men for future advancement

L and effectiveness in the organization.

Premium Stock

A University degree is somewhat like a block of stock
in a largeicompany. As such, a great deal of thought should
be given to the relative merits of the stock both before and
after it has been acquired. 8

Stock is "a handy" thing to have but only if it pays divi-.

dends. Thesmart buyer will make sure of the value before

1 he ‘buys stock and then he willdo everything in his power
to raise the value while he holds it.

Building the value of your stock in the University of
Pittsburgh is not a diﬂicult job. Even so, far too many
students continue to refer to Pitt as a streetcar college and
complain about every thing from the soup in the tuck shops
to the nuts on the eighth ﬂoor. ,

There are more men than you realize helping to spread
the ﬁne reputation which Pitt has gained through the years.
Dr; Jonas Salk works quietly behind the closed doors of

-a laboratory. When he and his colleagues conquer polio

every family in the world will know of the University and

_4 the unpayablegdebt they owe to it.
P Under Secretary of Labor Arthur Larson left his posi- -

tion as dean of Pitt’s School of Law. to work with Presi-
dent.Eisenhower and has become one of the best liked men
in lWashington. I '

Chancellor Fitzgerald has been working in cl.ose con-
junction with the President in determining student ex-
change policies throughout the world.

These men and others are doing an immeasurable
amount of good as ambassadors for the University. Through
their efforts Pitt has gained an unshakable reputation as a

pﬁne institution of ‘learning.

Such physical improvements as the student union and

dormatori-es will not beicompleted until after many of you_

graduate but they will add greatly to the prestige which
your degree will carry in later years.

Its good business, if nothing else, to build stock in your
University. After all, you’ll have your degree for the rest
of your life. ' -

By Irv Rothman

The Formosa crisis growsgmore
critical and we are aware that
rearmament of Germany in-
creases tensions between allies
and soviet governments. - But a
tinderbox we are likely to over-
look is the Union of South Africa,
presently en-
tangled in an

policy of race
segregation.

L a s t week
the w h i t e -
controlled

began an un-

pr 0 g r am of «

total_ racial
segregation. It ‘ called for the
forced transfer of 60,000 natives
from their Sophiatown commu-
nity in‘ J ohannesberg to a new
government-sponsored Meadow-
land project.

The Union, under control of
Afrikaner Nationalism since 1948
when Dr. Francois Daniel Malan
was elected Prime Minister, has
advocated separation as the only
means to white survival in the
“Dark Continent.”

Preserves Superiority
Afrikaners, descendents of
Dutch settlers who arrived at the
Cape of Good Hope in 1652, have
‘built up the apartheid philosophy
to preserve superiority on the
continent. The negro is consid-

KDKA news-

“Pitt is one of =
our best news
sources.”
Recently this reporter sat down
and thought of no less than 50

incidents that ma-de news last‘

semester. This news meant good

public relations, outstanding

progress ‘and expansion, and

thriving mental growth.

Voice of Students Heard
First of all, what about the

 

the limit of relationships between
him and his white neighbor.
Since the Anglo—Boer War‘ of
1899 and Dutch defeat, the Afri-
kaner has attempted to - regain
power in South Africa.‘ Malan’s
victory in 1948 grounded his
roots. It has enabled present pol-
icy, being offered by armed
troops. '
Two thousand ‘ police moved
into native quarters Thursday
and compelled 150 families *to

‘leave. Approximately 110 com-

plied, the rest hid with friends.
Priest Protests:

Th e. government ﬁnds in-
creased opposition in the church,
however. Father Trevor Middle-
ton, head of the Sophiatown mis-
sion, is reaching the climax of a

long-fought battle with Minister’

of Justice» C. R. Swart. Long an
antagonist of segregative‘ poli-
cies, the missionary has taken 40
families into his quarters. With
vigor —-of faith and belief in ‘all
men’s privileges, he has stood up
against the threats of government

‘strong men.

Now the priest has committed
the unpardonable sin of housing
negro‘ families under his roof.
Violence is in the offering. Swart

has proclaimed outwardly op-' ,

position to the mission and its
purposes. It would hardly be
possible to think that a solution
can be resolved through peace-
ful means.

Sides are drawn and the Cape
of Good Hope has become a cloak
of pent-up animosity. There is
no middle ground as the white

students themselves? There are
some who ﬁnd college morethan
just a place to sit in a classroom
for a few hours. Many. students
want more than just a textbook
education. This was exempliﬁed
when Men’s Council initiated
plans for a student political party
system. The initial plan to be
tried this semester will concern
only male students, but SC is
now investigating the possibilities
for the inclusion‘ ofpwomen in the
setup. A"
Pitt Men Honored

Men in the news is ﬁne pub-
licity and Pitt had an extra large
share last semester. Duly hon-
ored was Chancellor Rufus H.

V Fitzgerald when the J u n i o r

Chamber of Commerce selected
him as the Pittsburgh Man of the
Year Awardee. Also honored by
the J.C.’s was Capt. Tom Ham-
ilton, director of Athletics. After
Hamilton coached Pitt to a 21-19
win over Navy, United Press
cited him as the Coach of the
Week.‘ A

Dr. Jonas Salk’s polio vacine
won national acclaim. It is the
ﬁrst important step toward con-

and autocratic and the negro
populous, g r 0 win g prouder,
craves for its just privileges on
the continent as humans. There
are few whites on the side of
the negro; machine-guns and
bombs’ offer strong opposition.

Revolts Expected

“Aaron, incidentally,

The Dutchmen have no ,alter- ‘

native now except to precede with
their apartheid plan. Englishmen
throughout South Africa are
more prone to accept the ideal
of a common society of black
and white despite the Mau Mau
uprisings in Kenya. (There
whites and natives have com-
bined in efforts to defeat rebel
natives who want to wipe the
white man from the land.) They
are plainly worried over the
situationfurther South. The dis-
satisfaction in the Union of
South Africa may shortly break
out into mass uprisings and open
revolt against the white man to
drive him off the continent.

‘It seems‘ab~surd to expect that
total segregation can exist. After
all, it is the negro who farms
the land, works the factories,
and mines the gold for the white
man. One must work with the
other. Father iMiddleton is show-
ing how it can be done, but his
actions are considered immoral
and intolerable to the caucasoid
community. Under irreconcilio
able terms’ set up by the Afri-
kaner, co-existence is impossi-
ble.

So Africa is a third continent
teeming with disunity that bears
our attention as well as Asia and
Eurcpe.

dreaded diseases. This year _many
Pittsbugh school children will
beneﬁt from this Pitt research-
er’s discovery.
Expansion Means Progress
Expansion in any form spells
out progress. On this campus
architects and contractors are
having their heyday. Last sum-
mer ground was broken for the

George Hubbard Clapp Hall, a:

new science building. Work has
progressed steadily. Pitt’s much

proaches you and asks the pro-

minute or two. After all, Pitt is

Government Institute Gets $75,000

F ailks/lward Grant

Students of political science at Pitt will soon reap the
educational rewards of a $75,000 grant recently received from
the Maurice and Laura Falk Foundation; '

Announcing receipt of the grant at a dinner in the Hunt
Room, Webster Hall Hotel, Feb. 4, Chancellor R. H. Fitz-
gerald and Vice Chancellor Charles B. Nutting said it will

be paid over a ﬁve-year period. c

Staff to Double

The initial contribution will be
$25,000, the remaining $50,000 be-
ing paid in amounts decreasing by
$5000 each of the following four
years. The University’s financial
the Institute of Local
Government——to which the grant

. was given-—will be stepped up an-

nually by the amount of ‘the de-
crease in the payments by the
Foundation.

The Institute will double its staﬁ
and will expand its program in the
four primary ﬁelds of activity
which include (a) in-service train-
ing and education, (b) information
and advisory services, (c) re-
search and special studies, and

(d) secretariat services for local -

government associations.

According to William G. Willis,
executive directorof the Institute,
programs in each of these ﬁelds
have been received with such en-
thusiasin that demands made on
the Institute and the performance
expected of it have overwhelmed
both its staff and its facilities. ‘

Borer Newly Appointed

At the same time, announcement
was made of the appointment of
William W. Boyer, Jr. as associate
professor of political science and
assistant tothe executive director
of the Institute of Local Govern-
ment.

Boyer, who has already assum-
ed his new duties, has for the past
several months, been administra-
tive assistant to the governor of
Wisconsin. Hejhas had previous
teaching experience at the Uni-
versities.of Florida and Connecti-
cut and at- Grinnell College, Iowa.

Commenting on the Falk Foun-
dation grant, Dr. Nutting said:
“The generosity of the Maurice
and Laura Falk Foundation will
enable the Institute of Local Gov-
ernment to conduct to the fullest
the business for which it was
established. The result will be
almost a doubling of the services
of the Institute to local govern-
ment and local oﬁ“1cials.”.

Reynolds Heads A
Social Work Plan

A« new work-study program has
been initiated into Pitt’s School of
Social Work with a newly ap-
pointed assistant professor direct-
ing the three-phase course of
study.

Miss Jean Reynolds, professional
work advisor for the Girl Scouts
of America for the past nine years,
has been apponted the new assist-
ant professor in charge of the pro-
gram. _

Miss Reynolds, formerly asso-
ciated with the YWCA, will direct
a program of study which leads to
the master of social work degree
and allows the student to obtain a
professional education while em-
ployed.

The ﬁrst phase of the work-

study plan combines part—time

work and part—time study for a
two_ year period; phase two is a
one academic year period in which
the student is enrolled for full
time professional study.
months of ﬁeld instruction is in-
cluded in the third phase.

Wilbur I. Newstetter, dean of
the School of Social Work, said
that the new program has been
developed to meet an increasing
demand for professional social
workers in an expanding ﬁeld.

THE BULL SESSION

I wonder if they still make bull sessions the way they used
to. Well do I remember the bull sessions of my own undergrad-
uate days. How cogent they were! How informative! How. the
good talk crackled and our young hearts ‘leaped and the hoiirs

sped by as swiftly as minutes!

Our discussions were always

led by Jack Femur. (Good old

Jack! I hear he’s in the extruded aluminum game now.) We
would sit cross-legged in a circle around Jack and he would ﬁll .
his pipe with his own private blend - burley, latakia, and shred-
ded coconut. The rest of us preferred tobacco, so we would light
up Philip Morris. This is a procedure I recommend without qual-
iﬁcation to everyone who prefers tobacco because Philip Morris
has the tobacco that tobacco-preferers prefer the most-‘mild
vintage leaf with a clean, cool ﬂavor that soothes and steadies,
that gladdens and enlivens and refreshes. I '

Jack would puff on his pipe and we would puff on our
Philip Morris and the bull-session would begin its meandering
journey. The talk would touch on every subject known to man...
on every conceivable thing beneath the sun, but.no matter how
far the conversation wandered, it would always return to “Topic
A.” I refer, of course, to gardening. ‘

But, as I say, the discussion would cover many subjects before \
it came to the inevitable gardening. Jack would open each session
with a provocative question of a general nature, like: “What's
the most important thing a man can get out of college?”
“Girls,” Harold Clavicle would reply promptly. (Good old
Harold! I hear he’s in the frozen lobster tail game now.)
“No, I don’t think so,” Ben Fibula would say. “I think edu-

cation is the most important

thing you get out of college.”

(Good old Ben! He’s still in school.)

“Listen, guys, I’ve got a question,” Clyde Ilium would say.
“If you could spend a week either with Ava Gardner or with
Albert Einstein, which would you choose?” (Good old Clyde! I

hear he’s in the unclaimed freight game now.)

“Albert.Einstein, of course,”

Will Mandible would say. (Good

old Will! I hear he’s in the jack handle game now.) «
“What?” Cleanth Patella would cry, astonished. “You would

-rather spend a week with Albert Einstein than with Ava

Gardner?” (Good old Cleanth! I hear ’he’s in the unclaimed

freight game with Clyde Ilium.)

“N atch!” Will Mandible would answer. ‘ “

“But why?” Sol Sacrum would ask. (Good old Sol! I hear he’s
a parking meter in Deal, New Jersey.) .

“Because,” Will Mandible would cry, “if I spent a week with
Albert Einstein, maybe I would get so smart that I would
be able to ﬁgure out a way to spend more than a week with «

Ava Gardner!” ‘

Well sir, we laughed until our little uvulas were sore and then
we went on to a host of other -topics. “Do you think it's im-

portant to join a fraternity?” Murray Tarsus would ask. (Good ,
old Murray! I hear he’s in the mica game now.)

“Only if you are a boy,” Bob Turbinate would answer. (Good
old Bob! I hear,he’s in the sheared raccoon game now. [The
raccoon, incidentally, was invented by Milton Raccoon, whose
career should be a source of guidance and inspiration to us all.
Mr. Raccoon arrived in this country in 1907, penniless and not
speaking a word of English. Today he is the Mayor of four of

our principal cities.])

4

But to get back to the bull session -“What’s the best thing
to do when the girl you are dancing with insists on leading?”
Eric Ulna would ask. (Good old Eric! I hear he’s in the ﬂutte

valve game now.)

“Hit her,w.ith a folded newspaper,” George Vertebra would
answer. “Never hit a girl with your hand. They learn to associ-
ate the hand with food, and you must not confuse them.” (Good
old George! I hear he’s in the folded newspaper game now.)

And so it Went — the talk ranging the worldsof the arts and
the sciences and the social graces, until we would climb, spent
but happy, into our little hammocks . . . I wonder if they still
make bull sessions the way they used to.

Right about now, the stereotyped student newspaper
would come out with a blazing column explaining “What’s
wrong with our basketball team?”

However, we would liketo differ from this pattern by
not telling what’s wrong but letting the students ﬁgure
this out by themselves and instead giving some suggestions
to the people who run things around here.

The carrying-out of these resolutions I do not guarantee

will improve our basketball squad; but in the light of what
has happened to date, it couldn’t do any worse. So, without
further ado, here are the suggestions:

(1) Remove all local teams from the schedule. No, not
because Geneva and Westminster beat us this year but because
if we’re going to lose, it’s better to lose to the likes of Duquesne,
Kentucky, Villanova, North Carolina State, Niagara, Dayton,
etc. You learn more by getting beat by these squads then by
dropping 12-point decisions to Carnegie Tech in Skibo Gym, a
court that is closer to intramural size than collegiate.

Also, looking at the attendance of these district squads
at the Field House, I’m sure LaSalle would draw more than
900 people on a Saturday as one of the local team’s drew a
few weeks ago.

(2) As to style of play, let’s cut out this set pattern of
no set pattern and concentrate on something. Even a ﬁgure
eight would be better than what’s going on now. The fast
break is a form of operation that is popular now and
since many other teams are using "it on us, how come we
aren’t fast breaking?

In all seriousness, sometimes I think ‘some Panthers

with the ball. Let’s see some kind of system.
Also, we’re not a tall team and while 5-8 guards sometimes
tap in ﬁeld goals, for our purposes, let’s get the rebound and
' start the ball around instead of trying to put it up again with
a tap. We’ve lost many a basket because we’ve tapped three or
four times, missed, and the opposition got the ball.

This ends the resolutions and as I stated previously, they.’

are not guaranteed to work. They are only some observa-
tions which couldn’t help but come out after watching this

Riflers Top Three
Southern Schools
In Recess Trip

Wins over the Universities of
Virginia, Richmond, and Johns
Hopkins, featured a 1000 mile trip

taken by the varsity riﬂe team
during the mid-semester vacation.

Both the win over the Univers-
ity of Virginia and that over Rich-
mond were by wide margins. Vir-
ginia, one of the top schools in
their conference, went down to
defeat 1372-1347. James Cleary led
the Pittites with a 287 as they
walloped Richmond 1400-1240.

The signiﬁcance of the trip,
however, lay not in the wins but
rather‘ in the losses. Virginia
Military Institute, top team in a
league comprised of Southern
schools, hung the first defeat on
the touring Panthers in a tri-meet
with Washington and Lee.

Georgetown, number four team

in the nation, was next and they '

won by the narrowest of margins,
1407-1399. The difficulty contin-
ued at Annapolis where the Mid-
shipmen copped the duel meet,
1436-1380. Tom Sheppard con-
tinued his ﬁne average here by
ﬁring a 284.

At the University of Maryland,
the Panthers put a real scare into
the national champion riﬂers be-
fore dropping by a mere 18 points.
Sheppard and Cleary were top
guns of this meet, both ﬁring
279’s.

Squash Team
Gets Goose Egg
On Road Trip

Coach Jim Tu1ly’s squash team
drew the short end in ﬁve matches
during their mid-semester’ road
tour through New England.

Navy, Williams, Yale, Trinity
and Army played inhospitable
hosts by dealing out defeats to the
Pitt squashers.

The team composed of Milt
Emery, Pat Hughes, Leonard
Reeves, Allan Humphries and
Barry Smith inaugurated squash
as a varsity sport at Pitt. Pre-
viously, the team had competed
on a club basis.

AN INTERESTING POINT
about this season’s basketball
schedule is that the Panther hoop-
sters do not miss any ‘classes. In
the recent 4000-mile air trip the

ized. ~
