Explains Signiﬁcance of Hygiene
of the Mouth and Digestive.
‘Systpem ‘ - ~

 

Dr. Milton Goldsmith was the speak- ’

er at the hygielfe lecture given at;

J

Tree's _gy'mnla.sium . last Wednesday.-;

All freshmen were present as welli
as several upper classmen interested
in; this ‘ﬁeld of work. Dr. Frost opened"
the meeting _by int-oducing the speak-E
er. ’ The topic chosen by Dr. Gold-
slmith was “Hygiene of the Mouth
a..nld‘Dige'stive System.” He said in‘
part: A

“We eat to’ ‘live-—=tl'here.fore it '~
not be ‘amiss «or without weight to

speak of the various processes re- 5
, quired in eating and digesting foods.
The mouth is‘ the ~ first part of the

digestive machine and the most im-

portant part, since it contains the-

teeth. The teeth are a primary fac-

E tor since, food must be well chewed

before }rea1~ digestion -can take place.‘-

’ ,,-4‘.

.-This is done  almost au“omati«'_cally
-and the salivary glands stand out

prominently in this connection. The

stomach is the last part of the sys-‘

tem of_“vdigestVion, and it is here that,
-the food . is neutralized and changed
into its ‘ﬁnial cOIIStit11el1t'S. “f This al-

‘ ternation is brought about by the ac-

tion of pepsin and. ..hy~dI‘O'Cl1lO~I‘lC acid
on the food particles. After’ sufﬁcient
modiﬁcation, the food, is wholly dais-
solved_and absorbed by the blood.”

Dr. Goldsmith also mentioned the

ﬁve different kinds of food taken in
by the _human body, na.me1y,-—pro-
carbohydrates, hydrocarbons,
salts" and water. The most import-
ant of these are proteins, for the hu-
man body . would be an utter failure

wilth.out._.their pre‘senc‘é, in some form_

or other. .
; Dr. ‘Goldsmith advised his audience
as to what sort of foods were best
to be eaten during the various seas-
ons of the year, and also the quanti-
ties in which to eat tlhem. Great
stress was laid on this lalstpoint. All
in all the contents‘ of the lecture were
of great beneﬁt to thosepresent and

might be well to suggest that others.

beside freshmen should attend in
girder to reap some beneﬁt along this
me. '

The next lecture will be given De-
cember 15» and Dr. J. I. Johnson, of
the Medical faculty, will be the speak-
91% H18 topic Will be “Hygiene of the

- Respiratory System.”

 

 

At its regular meeting on Novem-
ber 23d the Dental Faculty went, upon
record as being unanimously in favor
of the adoption of the course of Mil-
itary Instruction, Science, and Tac-
tics in the University of Pittsburgh.

It further recommended that the
course be optional, that it be institut-
ed thls year if possible, and that it
should not exceed threewhouvs’ per
week, at such time as to interfere
least with the present schedule.

The matter will shortly be referred
to the student body of the Dental
School for their consideration.

rapidly putting the ﬁnishing touches
on -their work. E’xtra’rehearsa1s are

. being held.‘

The ﬁrst concert of the year will
be given at Marsllalsea, Friday ‘even-
ing, December 17.- This will serve as
a’ “dress rehearsal” though not a “full
dress.” Every year the clubs make
this trip to the county work house,’
and their entertainment is always ap-
preciated by the inmates. One feature
of the trip is the big “feed” which the
headof the institution always pro-
vides. _ _ ‘

The personnel of the clubs has not
been determined. All candidates will
be taken to Marshalsea, and the se-
lection will depend a great deal upon
the way in which the candidates con-

Because of this rela.tionL (between stu-

be enforced through the Court-sL.f _ For
example, if the holder. of the scholar-

ship or fellowship fails to comply with,_

by the university‘ as affecting that

no claim in law for the beneﬁts of the

other hand, if he_fu1Iy complieswith
said regulations, he has a, lawfulclaim
on the university that it perform its
part of the contract. But a scholar-
ship or fellowship, carrying a mone-

tary value, is not bestowed for ser-_

vices rendered in thesame sense that
money is paid by the university, to one
of its “servan=tss’L’LL -or “em-moves” for
services rendered. The studentwho
receives a scholarship, or free tuition

is not in the shoes of the contractor,.

who enters into an agreement to build
a building for the university,-—-and
by .‘‘University’’ is to be understood
the Corporation known by the name of
the university. The Corporation con‘-
tracts with the builder and has redress
if the contract is;_not.kept.; but has the
Corporation redress, that is,’ indemnity
for injury received, if the student to
whom’ a scholarship hasbeen granted
fails to comply with university rules
and regulations? L L L

The university may expel the stu-
dent, andLtl1<atLis the end.

It -can sue the contrac't‘or'for breach
of contract. L. L LL L

If a student were to injure the prop-
erty w0f the~Corporation he would be
liable to an action by the university
for dainages, but the action does not

action would lie against .a person or
persons not in student rLela.tLionshiLp to

Expulsion of the offending student
(or the "remiss student who has been
attending because of scholarship privi-
Llege) is not the legal equivalent of a
suit for damages against a delinquent
contractor.  . L s L
~AL member of the football Lteam,

ment under a contract with a builder
is a valuable consideration.

L_lf he fails so toL“LplayL,—,_-toL do track

body.‘ But if Lhe accepts the scholar-
ship under these conditiens, has he ».a
legal? claim against the C’orpora..tion,
provided he plays regularly. trains,

and otherwise complies with the rules L

and regulations1? *-
I know of no decision of the Courts
directly to the case. . There are how-

. ever many ‘decisions as to responsi-

bility under a contract.. is the player
able to make a binding contract‘! That
is, is he of age, freeto contract, able
and willing to contract, and actually
did contract? . - L

Is he a. minor?

But does the player perform a. val-‘
uable service for the university? This
must be taken .inL‘L a legal sense. It
means does he act as an employe of
the university. That depends upon
the contract or the absence of con-
tract. If he agreed to do «a valuable

service for the university,-——say, for a L

monetary remuneration to go out
among ﬁtting schools, visit parents,
,etc., and advertise the university, and
does so, and the Corporation agrees
to pay him for the same, he performs

And. yet football sservice is such,

that, as the Chronicle Telegraph tells,
its readers, “Even for boys in the

most rugged health, football has its
perils”, and “so1'ne-‘Lmeans should «be
devised to reduce its dangers”.

Now ILLam not writing: about reduc-
ing the dangers of football. We all

Football

million dollars are paid annually ‘for

its support. Gate-money runs intothej

scores of-,1thous‘ands of -dollars, and
crowds of‘ from 82 few hundred to

many thousands; assemble to L witness
the game and to spur on the players.

The game tends always towards pro-

fessionalism. This is inevitable. But

I do not,‘ presume to write of profes-
sional football so-called. The man
who enters the professional
makes football his business, precisely
as the contractor or builder makes
‘building his business.
heknows, or -at leastis presumed to

know, what he is doing,-——the risks he_

runs, the perils of the game, and the
“means he should devise to reduce the
dangers” or to compensate him if he
is injured. He goes into training as
a means for reducing the danger; he
takes out and insurance policy. an 30-
cident policy; (or somebody does it for

him), as a possible _compensation in
caseof injury. Possibly the Assoc.ia- L

tion. underwhich he .pl“ays carries a

blanket insurance ‘for each and all»

‘men in its employ; But‘ the uni-
versity football player is not a pro-

fessionalism, or to quotethe editorial
again, he “takes pride, in emulating
the dashing deeds of his elders and
especially in the display of courage
and indifference to pain.” He is as

near a professional as possible Without

being one. . L

But “A1l’s~Well that Ends Well.”
Suppose; however, it does not “end
well! Suppose that the university

is popularly (but not legally) known

tably bestowed. / L

The Yale game only two weeks‘ off

I nd with a number of the most likely
candidates yet to report. This is the
problem that confronts Coach Flint of
the basketball team. Strenuous effonts
are being made to "get all the eligibles
f_ last year to report and to have the
‘new men to try out. , In order to make
the showing against the Easterners
thatawei shoﬂd, it is absolutely neces-
sary that the best men should report
at! once so that the team‘ may be
picked and team work be organized.
-‘The prospects for thevseason are
as good if not better than last year
‘when the Pitt ﬁve won the champion-
hip of the Intercollegiate Associa-
tion of the state. Of the members of
{the last year squad we lose three men,
Captain ‘Oclrsenhirt, “Pink” Healey,
and “Babe” Gralham. Ordinarily if a
team lost three such valuable men as
these it would look like a bad seas-
, 11 following. However with the ma-
terial that played on the ﬁrst eight
last year and with the new ..material
it looks as if the Gold and Blue
epresentatives would again make all
their competitors take their dust.

from, and if the new men can keep
fupthe pace they have shown so far,

, it certainly looks as if the last year’s

The Pitt wrestling team’ is rapidly
rounding into shape for the coming
season, which «promises to be the most
successful ever experienced by the

‘Univensity. ‘With but one -exception

everyone of last‘ year’s squad are out
for positions. In addition to these
there is a wealth of new material
from the incoming -class.

Manager Huff has completed a sched-
ule that will tax the strength. of the
team. The Lehigh and Annapolis

meets will be especially hard as both

of these institutions are represented
by exception\a1ly strong teams. One
o-f the best parts of the schedule is

N-otahing deﬁnite has been decided
about securing a coach for this seas-
on. If-‘Reinecke can be secured.i't‘ will
certainly mean. that the Blue and Gold
matmen will be in charge of one of
the best coaches in this line of sport.
His own experience in this line of
athletics has ﬁtted him admirably for
the position. ‘ _

The schedule as given out so far
is asfollows: -

The Swimming team after their
decisive win over "the P. A. A. splash-
ers are now getting into trim for the
Open Meet which is to be given by the
Pittsburgh Aquatic Club on December
17, at the downtown Natatorium. The
following night the 18th, the team will
compete in a triangular meet with the
P. A. A'.;and Carnegie Tech. This meet
will take place at the P. A. A.

 

-The swimming coach is «still looking
for. a. high class plunger. Craig and
Reilly give promilseﬂof showing real
class and may ﬁll the only weak spot
on the team. In all the other.‘ dist-
ances and events the University is
well supplied with star performers. K.
Lovejoy’-s diving in the last P.‘ A. A.
meet was about the best seen around
here for several moons. It may be pos-
sible that a number of the men will be
entered in the swimming champion-
ships this year. The fellows certainly
have the class and if they get an op-
portunity to compete again-st some of
the Eastern men they should be able
to make a creditable showing.

The Pitt swimmers will ~measure
their strength against the team repre-
senting The City College of Baltimore
and possibly against the Baltimore
Athletic Club. These teams will be

,met on the same trip in which the

Naval Academy ﬁshmen are met.

The present members of the team
are -Sweet, Swope, Ludwig, Tanny, K,
Lovejoy, F. Lovejoy, Taylor, Rock,
Gorman, Sheidle, Hillman, Craig,

France, Berryman, Carroll, Cook, God-

fry, and ‘Steimert. It is hoped that
more -candidates will come out before
the bigger meets of the year occur.

GOLD AND BLUE DEEI

Corn.el1’s refusal to meet our champ-
ionship team is about what was ex-
pected. Cornell and Pitt both had
marvelous. elevens «on the gridiron this
fall and it would have been interest-
ing to have seen them meet. How-
ever since no game had been sched-
uled at the beginning o-f the year be-
tween the two schools it is just as
well that our loyalty and pride in the
teams should be. left to upholding them
and hoping to see the two elevens
meet next fall. We think that Cap-
tain‘ Wil1=iamson’s team was the best
in the country. Cornell thinks that
their pets -had the class. But basket-
ball season is here and a‘ chance for
a championship team is bright. Let
us pull for that now and next fall we
will show the critics that our team is
the greatest ever assembled on any
collegiate ﬁeld. ‘A

Pitt has received a communication
from the Michigan Agricultural School
asking for a date on our football
schedule for next year. It is hardly
likely that a game will be given them.
I-—Io~wever since the United States au-
thorities at Washington have decided
to discontinue football at the Carlisle
Indian training school it is likely that
one of the stronger elevens in the
middle west may be met next fall.

Pitt is situated. in a rather unique
way, halfway between the big East-

'ern and the big Western teams. Many
‘look forward

to a contest between
their favorites and one of the teams
in the West. Itiwould be an inter-
esting comparison to make at the end
of the season if the Pittites would
play one of the Western Conference
teams. The members of this organi-
zation ‘always have strong teams I in
the ﬁeld and should put up a hard
ﬁght against the local elevens.

Do not forget the football banquet

‘ that is to beheld at‘_the Fort Pitt_

Hotel Saturday night. This dinner is
-an annual event given in honor of the

gridiron. It enables the student to
show his appreciation for what they
have don.e- for the school. The tax
is small, the “eats” swell, the divers-
ions .amusing, and the spirit of fel-
lowship the best to be found any-
where. Remember Saturday night at
the Fort Pitt Hotel.

BASKETBALL
SCHEDULE IS A
STRENUIIUS

Manager S. D. Flinn of the Varsity
basketball team has completed the
schedule for the Gold and Blue toss-
ers. It has been the aim of the au-
thorities. to arrange a schedule that
would include some of the strongest ,
teams in the country and one that
would also makeit possible to get a
line on the championship team of the
state. The schedule as announced
certainly is the best that has ever
been arranged for a Pitt ﬁve.

The ﬁrst game of the year that with
the Yale quintet, last year’s intercol-
legiate champions of the United
States. promises’ to be one of the most
interesting of the year. The Elis will
present almost the same lineup that
took ﬁrst honors last year. This
