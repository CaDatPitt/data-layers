Alec Stewart pinched himself hard

wasn’t dreaming. A
After all, it’s not every day the dean of

“This is an absolute delight,” Stewart
said, referring to ire monetary gift the
Honors College will receive over the next
four years. “We’re going into orbit over it.”

The $5 million gift to Pitt’s Honors
College is one part of the overall $11 mil-
lion grant Pitt recently received ﬁ'om the
Richard King Mellon Foundation.
Chancellor Mark Nordenberg armounced
the amount and the details of the multimil-
lion dollar grant during Thursday’s meeting
of the University’s board of trustees.

The grant is one of the largest single-
foundation grants ever received by Pitt.

SGB addressing student needs through surveys

Jason Gallinger
Assistant News Editor

The Student Government Board said

2 a series of surveys is helping to remedy
its persistent problem of staying con-

nected to the student body it represents.

With mail—in questionnaires, man-
on-the-street interviews and question-
naires on SGB’s Web site, surveys to

i date have covered academic issues, the
= installation of more yellow emergency

telephones on campus, and an overall
evaluation of student—govemment per-

‘L forrnance. The goal is to learn about stu-
dent concerns and interests and to use
a that information to deﬁne future SGB
projects.

“Up on the sixth floor [of the
Vlfrlliam Pitt Union], you’re not where

‘V students are walking around,” board

member Elizabeth Klein said. “It’s easy
to separate yourself from what’s really
going on.”

Students contribute to the problem
because they rarely offer SGB feedback,
she said. Student government infre-
quently draws more than 10 people to its

weekly meetings, and Klein said few
students drop by SGB offices to discuss
issues.

Klein spearheaded the survey initia-
tive, which began during the spring 1998
semester, by making it one of her elec-
tion pledges.

She and fellow
board member
Damon Hudac col-
laborate on the pro-
gram, taking poten-
tial ideas for sur-
veys to the full SGB
for review and sug-
gestions. When the
results of a survey
have been tabulat-
ed, the full board
reviews them, and a ‘_

public report is
made during regular
board meetings,

“whether it’s good
or bad,” Klein said.
“If the results

SGB member Liz Klein says a series
are unfavorable, we °f 5”"V°Y5 h°|P5 the b°°"d 5"-"Y i“
know we have to l‘°|l€h Wm‘ $'Ud9M$-

work harder,” she said.

Hudac referred to the surveys as a
job evaluation for the SGB, whose rr1is—
sion is to work for all students.

“Student government ‘could afford
to be more visible to more people than
just those who are asking for money,” he
said, commenting
that SGB is most
widely known for
the process of allo-
cating money to stu-
dent groups.

The first sur-
vey asked students
to rank projects for

student govem-
ment’s Academic
Affairs Committee.
Issues included

expanding Hillman
Library’s Sunday
hours, modifying
teacher evaluations
every semester, and
starting a service to
sell class notes for
large lectures.

Another survey offered students a
chance to list ﬁve suggestions or con-
cerns about student—govemment perfor-
mance. One student indicated that SGB
should revise the allocations process —
which SGB did after former Allocations
Committee" Chairman Gerald Klayman
was accused of embezzlement — and
better publicize events and activities.

SGB most recently polled students
in the Union, in the Towers lobby and at
the student assembly meeting in
September, asking their opinions of a
proposal to spend $3,000 of the student
activities fee to install more campus
emergency telephones. Klein said the
students were overwhelmingly in favor,
with fewer than eight students out of the
nearly 200 polled voting no.

Students have cooperated enthusias-
tically when asked to complete the sur-
veys, Klein said.

“It was such a great experience for
me to get out of the ofﬁce during ofﬁce
hours and walk around and tell people
what I’m doing,” she said.

Kids help Semester at Sea reach
out to children of the world

Janet Syphan

Staff Writer

Five-year—old Johnny Light spent
Saturday morning putting crayons in indi-
vidual plastic bags. .

He and his mother, Cathy, were among
12 families who spent the day at the
Semester at Sea ofﬁce ﬁlling plastic bags
with crayons, pink and blue yo—yos, stick-
ers, neon jump ropes and miniature magni-
fying glasses.

The bags will be given ‘to children in
Malaysia, Vietnam, Kenya and India when
the SAS ship stops at those places in the
spring.

Christine Asenjo was one of the SAS
employees who spent “Make a Dilference
Day” — a national day of helping others —
with her family. Together, they prepared
boxes of clothing and toys for students to
give to the children in the countries they
visit during SAS’ 1999 spring voyage.

On Saturday, the Semester at Sea
Donation and Service Project packed 40
boxes. It plans to pack 70 to 75 boxes before
the S.S. Universe Explorer sets sail Feb. 17.

“I thought this would be a nice day to
get the work done and that it could be a nice
staﬂ event,” said Asenjo, SAS’ the academ-
ic atfairs coordinator.

Students participating in service pro-
jects during their voyage will distribute the
boxes to children in orphanages, hospitals
and schools. The students will also take the
children on a ﬁeld trip to a place like a zoo,
or stay and play with the new toys they have
brought them.

“Service projects help students become

more connected with other people in the E

world, and I think that’s what our students
are looking for when they go on these trips,”
Asenjo said.

Each child will receive a bag of small
toys, while the larger toys and clothes will
go to the organization that takes care of the
children.

“We like to leave the kids with some—
thing that is their own,” Asenjo said.

Asenjo, the founder of the Donation
and Service Project, receives requests from
organizations around the world and tries to
ﬁnd items that will fulﬁll their needs.

“St. Joseph’s Orphanage in Malaysia
speciﬁcally asked for educational materials
for math. So we found them board games
that helped kids learn math,” she said.

An SAS alumnus donated the games
when he found out his school district
plarmed to throw them away.

“Just about everything we get comes
from alumni,” Asenjo said “We plant the
seed with them that a lot of things that go to
waste don’t necessarily have to.”

The Donation and Service Project
began ir1 1993 out of Asenjo’s home. Since
then, SAS st11dents have delivered 750
boxes of donations to 12 charities around
the world.

“In the early years, we would visit
orphanages, hospitals and clinics. Many
times, [the people there] would present us
with small gifts for coming to see them, and
we wouldn’t have anything. The students
didn’t think it was right,” said John Tymitz.
chief executive oﬂicer SAS. “Then Chris

SAS

came up with this idea”

When the project first began, Asenjo
spent hours at thrift stores looking for
clothes and toys and packed 30 boxes for
that year’s voyage without any help.

“When people started to give things,
our basement was packed,” said Asenjo’s
husband, Julian. “It got too big to handle out
of our house, and Chris was doing a lot of
things solo.”

In 1995 the Asenjo family decided to
move the project out of their home and into
a storage space Julian Asenjo’s friend
donated. Although the donations still cone»
sist of “what I have time to collect,”
Christine Asenjo said, she gets a lot of help
with packing from her colleagues and their
families.

Cathy Light, SAS assistant coordinator
for academic affairs, brought her two sons:

million is his spending will be used for in
the coming years, he did say Pitt’s current
emphasis is on investing in st1rdent—life ini-
tiatives on campus. These initiatives range
from improving campus technology both in
computer labs and in residence halls to
expanding job—placement services in the
months prior to students’ graduations.

He also said the $2 million may go
toward sustaining excellence in certain aca-
demic areas. Because Pitt cannot always
wait for senior faculty members to retire
before bringing new talent into the depart-
ments, Nordenberg said some of the money
could very well “provide salary support
during transitional periods for potential suc-
cessors to [current] department chairs,
deans, or outstanding faculty members.”

Nordenberg said this would allow Pitt
to better maintain faculty strength and qual-
ity in all academic disciplines and would
enable the University to attract some of the
most talented professors to Pitt’s Oakland
campus.

“We deeply appreciate this generous
level of support from one of the preeminent
institutions in our community,” Nordenberg

said. “In addition to the very substantial

ﬁnancial assistance that this grant will pro-

’vide, it is also tangible evidence that the

‘goals which we have set for the University
are ones that are viewed as important and
achievable by some of the most knowl-
’edgeable investors in our community.”

: The Richard King Mellon Foundation
was founded in 1947 to support organiza-
lions involved in such areas as human ser-
vices, education, medicine, and cultural

activities, said Pitt spokesman Ken Service.

In the past, Pitt has received grants
from the Mellon Foundation, he said, but
the $11 million gift is the largest ever
received from the Pittsburgh-based organi-
zation.

Michael Watson, vice president and
director of the Richard King Mellon

Foundation, said that thepfoundation’s sup-
port was inﬂuenced by several factors.

“This grant is a reﬂection of the conﬁ-
dence which the Mellon Foundation has in
the leadership of the University, as well as a
recognition of the quality and strength of
the University’s academic programs and the
critical role which Pitt plays, and must con-
tinue to play, in the ongoing health and
vitality of our region,” Watson said.

Pitt worked side by side with the
Mellon Foundation in detennining where
the grant money would be best spent,
Nordenberg said. He also said he was
pleased that Pitt and the foundation have the
same priorities.

VV1thin the coming weeks, Nordenberg
and other University administrators will
begin discussions with leaders in the areas
targeted to receive grant money.

This includes Stewart as dean of the
Honors College. .

Both Stewart and Nordenberg agree
that the money will expand academic schol-
arships, as well as course offerings. Stewart
also said that he would like to see more
money going toward undergraduate
research opportunities, stipends for visiting
faculty members who are experts in their
ﬁelds, and strong summer programs.

Stewart said the Honors College put
together a wish list with the input of current
students taking honors courses and submit-
ted it to Pitt administrators in charge of
making a priority list.

“I think our success on getting onto that
priority list is largely a result of the high
achievement of Pitt undergraduate stu-
dents,” Stewart said, citing Pitt students’
impressive record in receiving prestigious
national academic awards. “We wouldn’t
have had a prayer on making the list if it
wasn’t for our students.”

Stewart feels the $5 million will not
only “invest in what’s a pretty good student
body right now,” but will also attract solid
students to the University in the future.

“It’s an exciting time to be at Pitt right
now,” said Stewart.

According to Klein, only one stu-
dent refused to take part in the campus
telephones survey. Other students asked
questions and volunteered explanations
of why they voted for or against the pro-
posal.

“It proves to me that students aren’t
apathetic if you make the effort to reach
out [to them]‘and get involved,” Klein
said.

The number of surveys SGB hands
out varies with the issue. ‘The board
stopped just short of 200 questionnaires
when it conducted the campus tele-
phones survey because, according to
Klein, the response was overwhelmingly
in favor. ‘

Other surveys are targeted at student

groups, in which case one survey is
mailed to each organization. Later in the
semester, SGB will survey the recruiting
practices of student groups, the kinds of
programming they sponsor, and whether
they get money from the allocations
process, as the board prepares to com-
pile a student organization resource
manual.

SGB plans two more surveys after
the one for the resource manual, Klein
said, although the topics have yet to be
decided. '

Klein said she hopes the next SGB
will continue the surveys, offering at
least two every semester. At the very
least, she said the next board should pay
attention to the results now being com-
piled. V

“It’ll provide a benchmark for the’

next board,” she said.

Former Pitt
scientist wins
naﬁonal
physics award

The American Physical Society has
given an award to a former Pitt physi-
cist who has tackled some of the same
problems as Albert Einstein.

Dr. Luis Lehner received the
Nicholas Metropolis Award for 1999 in
recognition of work he did to develop a
method to model gravitational radia-
tion. His work makes it possible to
solve one of Einstein’s equations deal-
ing with black holes in space. The APS
said Lehner’s work “significantly
advances” progress in this area.

The work done by Lehner, in con-
junction with a team lead by Pitt facul-
ty member Jeffrey Winicour, is consid-
ered a “grand challenge” of physics and

, is a part of the completion of the laser

interferometric gravity observatories
that the National Science Foundation is
building in the states of Washington
and Louisiana.

Lehner said he was surprised to
receive the award because he works in
the fields of astrophysics and relativity.
The work he was awarded for deals
with ﬂuid dynamics.

His time at Pitt was beneficial,
Lehner said, because he matured as a
physicist and as an individual, due
largely to guidance from'Winicour, his

A adviser, and Dr. Roberto Gomez, anoth-

er faculty member.

Lehner, a native of Argentina, cur-
rently holds a postdoctoral position at
the University of Texas.

The Nicholas Metropolis award is
named after one of the mathematicians
involved in first using digital comput-
ers to solve complex problems in
physics.

Colt’s smart gun addresses safety
concerns, but it's still way off

For all those worried about gun
safety, Colt has taken the initiative
to release a “smart gun” —— a
ﬁrearm that can only be ﬁred by its
owner. .

The smart gun can only be ﬁred
if the shooter wears a special
bracelet with a microchip that
matches the radio frequency of the
chip on the gun. So if you’re hold-
ing the gun, and you don’t have its
matching bracelet, the hammer will
not snap down.

Colt’s new gun, which should
improve safety and prevent people
trying to defend themselves from
being shot with their own guns, wiH
also redeﬁne the gun debate. Since
it addresses issues such as child
safety and self-defense, it has
attracted praise from several sectors
of the gun-control lobby.

“The only people who oppose
or question the usefulness of devel-
oping smart guns are the extremists
at both ends of the gtm-control
debate,” said Naomi Paiss, the com-
munications director for Handgun
Control, a gun-control lobbyist
group. ‘ '

In a declining gun market, Colt
has shown some initiative in bring-
ing out the smart gun, aimed at con-
sumers’ worried about their guns
falling into the wrong hands -
their children’s or a crirninal’s.

Though Colt is not the only gun
manufacturer developing a comput-
erized gun designed to be ﬁred only
by its owner, its is the closest to
production.

Deﬁnitely a step in the right
direction, the new gun still does not
solve all the problems. VV1th the
bracelet, there is the issue of keep-
ing it separate from the gun, keep-
ing it secure or having to wear it all
the time. Not that different from the
concern over where the keys to the
gun safe should be kept.

If a burglar breaks into the
house, and you’re not wearing the
bracelet, he could storm into your
bedroom and kill you in the time
you take-to ﬁnd it, fumble for it and
slip it onto your wrist. In the process
of developing a safe gun, it seems
Colt may have forsaken conve-
nience in times when you really
need a gun loaded and ready to
shoot.

But if kids are a concern and
you’re wonied about your gun
being stolen and used by criminals
to commit crimes, Colt’s smart gun
is a good idea. Also, there is less
chance for police officers’ weapons
to be used against them.

As technology improves, guns
will undoubtedly be a lot safer.
Until then, the smart gun will suf-
ﬁce.

VV1th all of the chatter in Washington. about
the Monica Lewinsky scandal, it is-unfortunate
the American people have almost totally ignored
a real scandal: the way our two major political
parties raise their money to ’conduct political
°amPa1g11S-

As Americans, we have traditionally prided

ourselves on having a clean, corruption-free sys-
tem of politics (though this is not the case, more
often than not). The disturbing reality of modem
electoral politics is this: Money rules. It deter-
mines how many ads you can buy, it determines
how much media attention you receive, and it
determines whether you can win

Money determines who will and who will
not serve in Congress as our elected representa-
tives; who will be our mayors, our governors and
our county commissioners; and who will ﬁnd
themselves unemployed after Election Day.
Thus, campaign ﬁnance reform is an important
issue, though you wouldn’t know it by the polls
that consistently rank campaign

ticed by the public at large.

Millions are spent each year by
an alphabet-soup conglorneration
of business and industry lobbies
with acronyms like NFIB, CFA and COC, using
their money to freeze reform proposals harmful
to their interests. For example, while senators
considered whether to" impose new rules on
HMOs this summer, Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott raised almost $100,000 in just three
months from health—related groups for his politi-
cal action committee.

According to a Lott spokesperson, “Money
in politics is not insigniﬁcant. It’s an important
component to keeping and maintaining the
Republican majority.” 'lhe director of the non-
partisan Center for Responsive Politics noted of

STEP valuable
introduction to college

As a former student in the Summer
Transitional Education Program, I felt the
Oct. 20 Pitt News staff editorial was disturb-
ing. I had conre to Pitt through STEP
because of reasons beyond my control.
STEP gave me the opportunity to prove that
I can handle the college workload and live a
college life. STEP is not all about grades and
classes; STEP is about maturing and leam—
ing to live on your own and to be responsi-
ble for your own actions. .

STEP gave me the opportunity to learn
those lessons before the rest of the freshman
class arrived in the fall. The students I knew
who did not attend STEP seemed unable to
handle the load and were overwhelmed with
the whole college atmosphere. Though the
classes were not as challenging as my cur-
rent classes, the challenge of STEP was
learning how to live and learn in college.

When I told many people that I had
attended STEP, many wished they could
have, too. When they arrived in the fall,
walking around lost and confused and won-
dering what was going on, I was telling
them where to go and what to do.

IamgladPittistryingtoimproveits
image, but blaming the lack of academic
perfonnance on STEP is ludicrous, inappro-
priate and insulting. Obviously, the Editorial
Board did not attend STEP and did not wit-
ness the program’s positive contributions to
this school.

Although we were affectionately
labeled “Stupid Teens Entering Pitt,” we
have contributed positively to this university

and have learned valuable lessons that will ,

enable us to be one STEP ahead.

Evangelical Christians & KKK: separated at birth?

Dave Madden

Columnist

As an opinions writer for this publica-
tion, I’m always torn when moronic
columns get published (unless, of course,
they’re my own). At ﬁrst, I get very angry
that such stupidity can get printed, but then
I usually end up amused that such stupidity
exists. Ramesh Reddy’s beautifully loving
column (“VV1th love, homosexuality can be
cur ” from Oct. 20) is a perfect example
of the sort of writing I love to hate.

I could spend the entire column trying
to convince everyone that Reddy is an idiot,
but anyone with any intelligence can easily
identify such narrow-minded homophobia
when he sees it. What’s important is the
ease with which anyone can put his beliefs
into the media, and why Reddy and others
like him are doing a miserable job of being
taken seriously.

Throughout Reddy’s wonderfully
insightful column, he, like so many evan-
gelical Christians (from here on labeled as
“vangies”), defends every opinionated

A statement with Bible quotations. Vangies

seem to collect these like my bedroom does
dust, and they use them at every chance
they get.

' What good does a quote from the Bible
do for a guy who regards the book as a

thatGodmeantmantobewithwoman
because it says so in Genesis is just as effec-

tive of my trying to convince people they

shouldn’t do drugs because “Saved by the
Be1l’s” Jessie Spano nearly lost all of her
friends during her little caffeine-pill stint. I
wouldn’t be taken seriously, and the vang-
ies shouldn’t expect to be.

There’s a delightfully entertaining
show called “His Place” that is televised on
some local Christian public—access channel
out of Wall, Pa. The pronoun in the title is,
of course, referring to God, it being his
diner where you can come chat out your
problems over some good Christian coffee.

A good friend of mine and I are hooked
on the show. We watch it diligently, soaking
in the Christian rock acts, the acting and
most deliciously, the drama The acting on
“His Place” is very choice, and when the
operator of the diner got hit in a parking lot

«melee, I was on the edge of my seat.

I could never take seriously anything
said on “His Place” because all the charac-
ters on the show are typically backwoods
Western Pemrsylvanians. In many ways,
the show is a comedy, but the humor is so
lame, my parents wouldn’t even laugh at it.

“His Place” and all other shows on this
and similar Christian channels don’t seem
to try to be innovative or intelligent in any
way. Faith alone has helped them get
through their lives, and they must believe
that it’s all they need to spread the word.lI
personally have never seen a single vangie
who I thought had new, refreshing ideas
and spoke with respectable oratory.

Evangelical Christians seem very sim-
ilar to the Ku Klux Klan, putting on televi-

sion leaders who show a lack of worldly
intelligence. Anyone who’s read earlier
colurrms of mine knows how much I live

for the “Jerry Springer Show,” so you can I

imagine I’ve had my ﬁll of televised
Klansmen. Every time a Klansman sticks
his redneck sneer on my screen, I can’t stop
laughing no matter how hard I try.

' I’ve never seen an eloquent member of
the Klan, and consequently, I’ve never been
tempted to join (1 also don’t hate anyone
based solely on what he looks like).
Vangies and the Klan are similar in that
they’re both extremely vocal and tend to
sound completely absurd to anyone who
doesn’t believe in their respective dogmas.
The two groups are at opposite ends of the
love—hate spectrum (although ironically,
Reddy does claim to profess love for his
sinning homosexual peers — I can’t seem
to understand how).

There must be some sort of respectable
balance between devout faith and worldly
intelligence, but reading columns like
Reddy’s and watching “His Place” make
me lose all hope of ﬁnding it. The Vangies
should make this delicate balance their
immediate goal and then move on to taking
over the world. In the meantime, kids, keep
your idiotic beliefs to yourselves.

Dave Madden wishes he could be an igno-
rant homophobe or even a revolutionary
“dank urban poet, ” but you and he both
know he’ll never live up to the standards of
his fellow columnists.‘

Yander’s thoughts
on the world of
sports

I’m not going to sit here and
blow sunshine up your ass, boys
and girls, but instead, I’m going to
vent my feelings about what I
believe is wrong with sports today.

In the last few days, I’ve
noticed too many things happening
in sports that were not being dealt
with on the playing field, but
instead in a courtroom.

1. Mike T‘yson’s boxing license
reinstatement What in the
world is the Nevada Athletic
Commission thinking? It seems to
be more concerned about putting
warm bodies in boxing-arena seats
than about the safety of opposing
boxers. Tyson is sure to be an even
bigger draw after such a wave of
controversy. That makes everything
okay, right?

The NAC allowed five doctors
from Massachusetts General
Hospital to testify about what they
found from psychological testing of
Tyson. The lead doctor, Ronald
Schouten, told the commission that
Tyson is “a very complex individ-
ual with strengths not always
apparent and weaknesses that are
sometimes too apparent.”

Sure, Doc, those weaknesses
just happen to include biting human
beings. But that’s OK because
Magic Johnson is going to take care
of Tyson! -

The bottom line is that Tyson
doesn’t belong in the ring, and he
surely doesn’t belong among the
public in society. He’s a menace.
Didn’t we learn that after he raped
a woman?

2. The NBA lockout — Luxury
tax, revenue sharing, the “Larry
Bird exception.” Can we just play
some basketball? I am sick and
tired of hearing owners and players
(in any sport) complaining about
not having enough money. Only
Roger Marino can complain about
that, and that’s even suspect (I’ll
get to that later).

Apparently, the players won’t
be getting paid during the lockout.
Poor babies.

That means Patrick Ewing and
Shaq won’t be getting their $18
million and $15 million checks,
respectively. If I can wait a month

Women split two games on road trip

Laura Loner

 

For The Pitt News

The women’s soccer team split two
road games last week to make its overall
record 8-9.

Thursday, the women defeated Robert
Monis College, 6-3.

The Panthers were led by Cande Ruiz

— who had four shots, two goals and one
assist — and Charity McClure, who had
seven shots, one goal and one assist

Ruizleadstheteamwith 10goals and
26 points this year. McClure lingers not far
behind with 23 points on seven goals.

This successful offense is something the
Lady Panthers did not have in their first two
years.

  

ERIC WHlTEMAN/ PHOTO EDITOR
Cande Ruiz leads the Lady Panthers in scoring this year with IO goals and six
assists for 26 points. She scored two goals against Robert Morris Thursday.

The team had very little scoring in their
first two seasons but has made up for that
with 35 goals so far in its third season.

Brigid Handforth, Charity Kriley and
Renee Spampinato each netted one goal, and
Holly Mays added one assist.

Goaltender Nicole Bashor had one save,
and Sarah Stout had three saves but gave up
three goals. The goalies split time in the rout
of the Colonials.

The Lady Panthers tried to take their
high-powered offense to Virginia, but Old
Dominion had different ideas.

Sunday, the Lady Panthers were shut
out by the Lady Monarchs, 3-0.

Although Pitt remained scoreless

throughout the game, it did register eight
shots on goal, four comer kicks and two
saves.

Pitt is 5-5 in the Big East, its best record
ever in the conference. The women expect to
make the playoffs this year but have to wait
toseewhatelsehappenswithotherteams
before they can boast of their ﬁrst playoff
appearance.

Men lose to St. John’s and lose hope in the Big East

Sports Edltor

The Pitt men’s soccer team took its
seventh conference loss this weekend at St.
John’s.

The Panthers lost the Big East contest,
2-1, Saturday afternoon in front of 2,514
fans on a late goal by the Red Storm.

“That’s the story of our year. We have
not been able to get it done at the end,”
head coach Joe Luxbacher said.

The Panthers have lost several games
on goals in the last ﬁve minutes.

The Panthers play in arguably the best
conference in the country, the Big East,
with six teams in the top 20 nationally,
including No. 1 Connecticut.

Pitt has played all of these teams
tough, taking UConn to overtime and not
losing by more than two goals to any
ranked team. ,

‘These are not the results we have
been looking for, but they are not against
weak  Luxbacher said

The Red Storm opened the scoring
early on a goal from Ranford Champagnie.
The goal came off a penalty and was blast-
ed behind Panther keeper Chris Hanlon.

It was an indirect kick off a touch from
Danny Parkin. This goal at the 8:19 mark
gave St. John’s an early 1-0 lead

The Panthers answered just under 10
minutes later with 17:59 gone in the ﬁrst
half when midﬁelder Drew Kopp hit a blast
from 18 yards out to beat Red Storm goal-
keeper Daniel Popik

Kopp’s seventh goal of the season
came off of a pass
from Phil Matilla.
This goal gave Kopp
17 points for the year,
which leads a strug-
gling Panther
offense.

The game
remained knotted at
1 through the rest of
the ﬁrst half and dur-
ing much of the sec-
ond. Just when it
looked like the game
would go into over-
time, St. John’s came
through with the
game-winning goal.

Injuries have caused the Pitt
men’s basketball team some rough
times lately, and there is more trou-
ble to come.

Senior All-America candidate
Vonteego Cummings, who was set
to be the team’s starting guard this
year, fractured his left hand Friday
in a preseason workout.

Cummings is set to miss at least
two weeks with the injury, but he is
not the only Panther expected to
miss action early this season.

Freshman Chris Seabrooks and
sophomore Stephen Flores are
expected to miss some early games
due to injuries, but both are pro-
gressing nicely. Sophomore Attila
Cosby also has not been practicing
full speed but is expected to be
100-percent healthy for the start of
the season.

Seabrooks had surgery on his
right knee during the off—season
and has not fully recovered yet,
while Cosby has a minor foot prob-
lem. Flores broke his right thumb
and is out three to six weeks.

The injury bug seems to hit the
Panthers every year. At the begin-
ning of last season, the team had to
dress Oliver Antigua, one of its
managers, during practice and
games because it did not have
enough players to hold practice.

The Panthers had only seven
players when they played their first
game last season, and every player
except Jarett Lockhart missed a
game last year due to injury.

This season, the Panthers will
open with an exhibition game
against the California all-stars

This is a hard result to accept, accord-
ing to Luxbacher, because one of the
Panthers’ goals this year was to make the
Big East tournament, and they came up
short.

“We’ve played ﬁve teams in the top 15

The Pitt volleyball team had a big game
Saturday and defeated Rutgers in three
straight games, 15-4, 15-10 and 15-10 in
front of a crowd of 304.

VV1th the victory, the Lady Panthers
improved to 11-10 overall and 2-3 in the Big

Paula Zemrowski led the team in kills
with 16 and she also had 10 defensive digs.
Melissa Alpers racked up 10 kills, eight
defensive digs and two service aces. Lisa
Riggle contributed 38 assists, two kills, one
ace and three digs. ,

It was an impressive win for the
Panthers, as they were in control for the

majority of the match and outplayed the
Lady Knights from the beginning to the end

Unfortunately, the Lady Panthers lost

Zemrowski had another big game,
recording ﬁve career highs. She had 23 kills
on 51 attempts to go with 12 digs, ﬁve aces,

Senior Football Writer

Matt Morgan, Plum High
School senior and future Pitt
Panther offensive lineman, left his
school’s Friday night contest
against the Franklin Regional
Panthers late in the first quarter
with a lower back injury.

The 6—foot-7, 290-pound tackle
returned later in the half but spent
most of the contest on the bench.

Franklin Regional, still unde-
feated for the season, downed
Morgan’s Mustangs, 42-7.

“We kind of played him spar-
ingly,” said Plum head coach Bill

, just
Homecoming loss to the Scarlet-

Rometo, who had Morgan in the
starting offensive and defensive
lineups at the beginning of the con-
test.

Morgan, one of the 'area’s high-
est—ranked high-school prospects
according to many national recruit-
ing publications, made an oral com-
mitment to the Panthers on Oct. 17,
before Pitt’s 25-21

COLUMN

for my paycheck from Pitt, then
these guys can wait for the money
they probably don’t need anyway.
How about sending me some of that
dinero, muchachos? I need to pay a
parking ticket.

As for the owners —— shut up!
All of you. You own a business. You
knew exactly what sort of expenses
you were going to have when you
purchased the team. Let’s get the
keys out and unlock this thing.

These owners do not have it as
bad as they want you to think. Most
do not pay any sort of rent for the

FROM PAGE 8

_ buildings that their teams play in.

In some cases, their cities even. paid
for the arenas. It’s the ‘90s, after
all.

The NBA owners and players
need to realize that they’re doing a
lot of harm to the league’s reputa;
tion.

The league has been booming in
the past few years, and this lockout
has done nothing but tarnish the
NBA.

The owners are stupid for
allowing this to happen. They can’t
make any money while their players
are off making babies out of wed-
lock, can they?

3. The Penguins file for bank-
ruptcy again — Pittsburgh
Penguins owners Roger Marino and
Howard Baldwin have piled up a
$37.5 million debt over the past two
seasons, forcing the Pens recently
to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection  again.

Marino says the only solution
now is to build another arena.
Imagine the loan officer’s reaction:
“Yeah sure, here you go, Roger.

You seem to have an excellent
credit background. Oh, wait a
minute — you have just a little too
much debt than we allow. Sorry.”

Anyway, Marino accepted $12.9

million in renovations in exchange .

for extending the Penguins’ Civic
Arena lease through 2007.

Roger, you should be grateful
that you got any money for renova-
tions.

Isn’t it time we stop building
arenas. and stadiums for these own-
ers who complain about a lack of
revenue?

It’s not the public’s responsibil-
ity to financially support these
teams. Actually, we do —- it’s called
the $65 ticket. As Vinnie Barbarino
from Welcome Back, Kotter says —
“What a gyp!”

In the end, the Pens and Marino
will probably get a new arena.
That’s the kind of demented world
we live in. How does the Mellon
Bank Money Pit sound?

I guess all I want is to have my
faith restored in sports. No, not just
in sports, but in love, life and
sports. In that order please.

I do have my priorities, you
know.

Jay Yander is a columnist for The

Pitt News and hopes to find a
woman with the same priorities.
