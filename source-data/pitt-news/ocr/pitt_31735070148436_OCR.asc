Assistant News Editor

A former Pitt football player
was found guilty of simple as-
sault Monday, one year after his
arrest.

Judge Donna Jo McDaniel
sentenced Jeffrey Knox, 19, to
two years of probation in the Al-

legheny County Court of Com-

monpPleas after a Sept. 23, 2010,
arrest. '

He was found notguilty of
three other charges: a second
account of simple assault, reck-
lessly endangering another per-
son and disorderly conduct.

Knox’s lawyer Phillip DiLu—
cente said the: result was fa-
vorable because “it could have
been a lot worse than what was
charged.” '

The Pitt News reported at the
time of Knox’s arrest that police
were called to Chatham Universi-
ty’s Fickles Hall with complaints
of a man choking a woman. Ac-
cording to the complaint filed
in Pittsburgh Municipal Court,
Knox assaulted the woman after
she told him she was pregnant.

Mike Manko, spokesman for
District Attorney Stephen A. Zap-
pala Jr., said McDaniel ordered
that Knox have no contact with
the woman involved in the as-
sault case. '

Colleges Against Cancer receives awards

Joe Chilson -

For The Pitt News

Within ﬁve years of its founding,
Pitt’s Colleges Against Cancer
has grown from two to 70 mem-
bers and now holds the title of
the American Cancer Society’s
Chapter of the Year.

The American Cancer Society
awarded the student group the
status of Chapter of the Year and
the award for most online fund-
raising at their annual summit

last week at the David Lawrence
Convention Center.

Pitt beat 85 other regional col-
leges throughout Pennsylvania

_ and Ohio, including Penn State

and,Ohio State, for both of the
awards. ' P C, J _ V

Chapter president Lindsey
Dietz attributed the chapters
success at last Monday’s summit
to the explosivegrate at which
involvement in Colleges Against
Cancer has grown at Pitt.

“Pitt has done more in four
years than most chapters have

done in 10;” said Lindsay Hartwig,
Pitt’s liaison to the American Can-

‘ cer Society. “This proves this is

something that students care
about ... and Pitt has the right
leadership to make students
care.” A ‘ '

Relay for Life, the ch_apter’s
main fundraising event that takes
place every April, had 101 teams
and 1,085 participants last s_e—
mester. The event raised a total
of $113,000.The annual Relay
takes place on the Cathedral lawn
overnight, where teams formed

www.pitt.-edu/~-buckets‘!

by students take turns walking
around a set track for about 15
hours. The lawn is filled with

tents from each team, as well .

as various activities and games
to entertain the participants as
they walk to raise money to fight
cancer.

The online fundraising for.

Relay for Life comes from each
team’s account on the Relay’s
website, where members’ friends
and family can pledge money be-
fore the actual event takes place.
People can also donate money

Board denies Pitt FeelGood’s, allocations request

Tegan Hanlon
Assistant News Editor

Pitt’s FeelGood chapter did not receive its request-
ed fundingfor a conference at'Iuesday’s Student
Government Board meeting, twoweeks after the
group withdrew its original request.

Senior Alyssa Weisensee and junior Aidan
Smith requested $1,130.96 to send four students
to the Hunger Summit, which will be held in

New York City from Oct. 21 to Oct. 23. Four SGB ‘

members votedto deny FeelGood’s requestinfull,
in line with the Allocation Committee’s recom-
mendation

Board members Alex Zimmennan andjohn
Hasley voted to approve the request, while Ryan
Gayman andjames Landreneau abstained ﬁom
the vote. '

When reading the Committee’s recommen-
dation in Nordy’s Place, Allocations chairman
Michael-Bane said that the recommendation to
deny in ﬁill was made on the grounds that the
gmupwould notbringback any relevantprogram-
mingfrom the conference.

Caitlin Walker, an alumni ofboth Pitt and Feel-
Good, and nursing graduate student Tricia Selin

v said the original 0st of $450 to send one student

joined the two Pitt FeelGood representatives to
push forthe Boardtoreconsidertheir allocations
request. A granted request would allow students
to attend the Summit with 20 FeelGood chapters
ﬁ'om universities nationwide and representatives
from15 countries. ,
At the Sept. 20 Student Government Board
meeting, FeelGood requested $3,432 for nine
members to attend the New York City Confer-
ence. The Allocations Committee recommended
thatthe Board deny the request infull onthe same
grounds as 'Iuesday’s meeting. The Board voted
to reject Allocation’s recommendation and after
discussion, FeelGood withdrew their request.
The national FeelGood organization’s mis-
sion is to end world hunger, and every Thurs-
day Pitt’s chapter sells grilled cheese at Nordy’s

Place. Weisensee-said that the past four weeks ’

has brought in more donations than ever before,
earningthe club $2,353.08. p
Walker, a 2010 Pitt graduate who attended a
previous Summit, vouched for its importance.
,“It’s the reason why I’m still in Nordy’s,” she
said, as‘ she still attends the Thursday events.
Selin spoke to the Board about the efforts al-
readytakentoraisefunds forthe conference. She

      

to the Summit, which includes lodging, the con-
ference ticket and food, has been brought down
to $150.

Weisensee said that the students that the club
plans to send will help the entire club by taking

notes on the information presented by speakers '

and other universities and sharing it upon their
return. ' .

Smith also noted to the Board that next year
willmarkatransition periodforthe club, as many
of the leaders are graduating soon and the under-
classmenwill have to step up.

“[Itwill] getthe next generation of people en-
ergized about it,” he said. “You needto go and see
and hear and listen to all of these people.”

Despite the conversation between the Board
and the four FeelGood representatives, half of
the Board was left unswayed — enough to turn
down the request. ,

“You guys are almost better than this confer-
ence, in my opinion,” Board member Matthew

' Riehle said, addingthathe believes FeelGood does

a“gneat job” already. .
Weisenseesaid FeelGood will still send nine

students to the Summit, but while the club will .

Dietz said the chapter’s rapid growth '

and success in the past few years “shows
that even though college kids are busy, they
do care about important causes.”

Ashley Davis, the business manager
for Pitt’s Colleges Against Cancer, said
the chapter raised its goal this year to
$130,000, which will go to the American
Cancer Society.

“We’re on the fast track to becom-

Davis said.

American Cancer Society to fulﬁll four stra-
tegic directions: cancer education, political
advocacy, support for cancer survivors and
an annual Relay For Life, which is their big-
gest source for funds and publicity.

While Relay For Life may be the group’s
most notable event, they also raise funds
and build awareness by, holding smaller
events throughout the school year that
contribute to the grand fundraising total
at the year’s end.

This year, Pitt’s Colleges Against Cancer
will hold a “Bowling For Boobs” event in

The student group will play off the event’s

Examine drunken
Facebook habits

Seemingly innocuous drunk Face-
booking might reveal some pretty
heavy stuff.

According to a Reuters Health
study of 224 undergrads with pub—
lic proﬁles, those who published
photos and posts about excessive
drinking are more likely to be at
risk for alcohol problems. No sur-
prise there.

Interestingly, the researchers
mused upon ways universities
could combat excessive drinking
with the use of Facebook. If there’s
more than a 50 percent chance that
a student who posts about “black—
ing out” is going through alcohol
dependency, why not monitor his
or her Facebook account? They
said resident assistants could keep
an eye on their residents’ proﬁles
and report data back to the univer-
sity. Universities could also request

that Facebook implement some.

type of targeted counseling ads on
proﬁles that use binge—drinking
jargon.

But we don’t think these are vi-
able solutions.

If RAs were forced to monitor
their residents, their university
would be abusing and exploiting
the bond between RA and student.
And if students feel like they’re be-
ing targeted by their RAs — peers
who they should be able to trust
— they would be inclined to dis-
tance themselves, privatize their
Facebooks and possibly bottle up
crucial emotions.

Further, if universities threw
money into the Facebook-ad plot,
how effective would it really be?
Students would likely take an al-
cohol-dependency adjust about as
seriously as one about ﬁxing their
credit scores.

Instead, wethink the solution

lies with Facebook users them-
selves. Each proﬁle can serve as a
personal intervention: either an

intimate reﬂection on your own —

drinking or a_deeper look into a
friend’s behavior. If this=~research
means anything, it’s that a latent
problem can manifest itself in
some pretty obvious ways.

If Pitt were to consider a plan to
help — not punish — those with
alcohol problems, we think imple-
menting more staff at the Coun-
seling Center is the only efficient
solution. Pitt’s main focus should
be on the people who reach out for
help. Those people need a strong
support system, not an RA they
can’t trust or detached ads.

With this new information, Pitt
shouldn’t rush to do anything de-

structive. The only answer we can

stand behind is a better support

look at what you’ve posted in the

Have you hurt yourself or anyone

Your favorite “Moustache” columnist puts together a refreshing formula for TV excellence.

Columnist

If you’re anything like us, you
undoubtedly spend most of your
waking hours daydreaming about
_how to earn a lot of money without
doing a lot of work — or any work,
for that matter. But how, pray tell?
There’s the lottery, but only re-
ally experienced gamblers and
number-crunchers ever win that
one. What about slam-jamming
it home in the NBA? Not if you’re
under 8-foot-9. Professional Mad-
den 2012 player? Nah, you lack the
manual dexterity to “juke” all those
99-rated linebackers. Hardgain-
ing and “I-Iydroxycutting” on the
bodybuilding circuit? Sorry, friend
—— with a puny frame like yours,
expect a lifetime of brawny bullies
kicking sand into your face when-
ever you visit one of our nation’s
many splendid public beachﬁes,
So what’s left? Are you doomed
to a life without such ﬁnerthings
as imported buffalo mozzarella,
growlers of stone-groundJmilk-
weed beer and carbon offset cred-

its? No, there’s still one way to

make good on your promise: You A

can invent the greatest TV show in

the history of mankind. Sound dif- I

ﬁcult? Not in the least. In fact, we’ll
walk you through the process.
Step one: We need to pick a

plausible “high concept” — some-

thing very relatable, very now.
Let’s brainstorm for a minute.
What’s relatable and now? High
school, for one. Almost everybody
is trying to emulate those cool kids
who comprise our nation’s latest
youth movement. And what do
those cool high school kids have
that the clueless old fogeys in our
target demographic want? The lat-
est in advanced technology: iPads,
Facebook, Angry Birds, unlaced
high-top shoes, do-flags, boom-
boxes, scooters, neogshades and
so much other greatistuff. There
you have it: Our soonélto-be"stIlash
hit “The Tech Boyzz” (the second
“z” is for marketingffiumoses) is
ready for development. ,

Step two: Now it’s time to
come up with the aestheticlifor
our show. Let’s make this one ‘of-
those “documentary-style” sit-

coms that viewers seem to love
so much these days, ,except‘we’ll
give it an incredibly intrusive laugh
track that will remind out— of-touch
losers like your parents when they
need to start guffawing. No one
will ever explain, even in passing,
why the show is being ﬁlmed this
way — it’s just a vehicle for our

, cute-as-.a-button lead Tech Boy to

wink, wink, wink at the camera
and pretend to be a 16-year-old
despite the fact that he’s pushing
40. In fact, we want all of the ac-
tors playing these characters to be
industry veterans, because who
better than an established,’ middle-
aged thespian to play a horndog
teenager? We’ll give preference
to actors who have spent their ‘en-
tire careers playing such horndog
teenage roles, because that will
make their new, identical roles
easier for our realism—obsessed
viewers to swallow.

Step three: Okay, it’s time to
sketch out the dramatis personae.
Based on their preference for well-
developed characters like Charlie
Harper and that other, wimpier

guy from “Two and a Half Men,”
it’s clear that our viewers have
high expectations in this regard.
But don’t worry, because we’re
about to render our Tech Boyzz
as vividly as if they were recurring

players in the beloved daily comic .

“Gil Thorp” (or, better still, “Mary
Worth”). . _ '
The four main Boyzz are Lance,"
Dance, Chance and Rance.’ They
want the same things that we think
all kids in their age group want:
to get picked ﬁrst in gym class,
land a hot date for the prom and
have hours of downtime to play
Madden 2012. The personalities

of these kids are totally unique, V

which you’ll be able to tell from
the clothing they wear.

Rance is real cool and always
wears his favorite pair of neon

shades. Dance is also ‘extremely
cool and doesn’t go anywhere
without his favorite skateboard.
Chance is a co‘ol—as-a-cucumber
customer who wears his favorite
electronic keyboard around his
waist at all times. And Lance, the

p leader of the group, wears his ball _

cap backward andgcarries around
his favorite skateboard, Thanks to
our research in the public schools

~ of tomorrow, their language is

“with it” too. They’re always say-

. ing cool new phrases like “L-O—L,”

“O-M-G,” “S—M—H” and “L—M—F—
A-O” to one another. Imagine the
catchphrase potential!

Step four: Here’s where we’ll
need to come up with some grip-
ping stories to move»“The Tech
Boyzz” from episode one to epi-
sode 22. This can be a bit of a pain,

since it involves a modicum of ac-
tual work, but our high concept is
so good that the show will more or
less write itself.

In the ﬁrst episode, Rance will
ﬁnd himself struggling to ﬁnish
his term paper in time for the big
dance. How the heck will he do it?
The paper is about the Pilgrims —
see, that means we can rerun this
as our Thanksgiving special — and
there appears to be no way that he

can get it done. But suddenly, he

decides to use his cellular phone —
all the kids have “cellys” with which
they “hit up” one another ——, and
“hits up” Dance, who comes over
and connects his 14.4 bps MAX
modem to the _World Wide Web.
Even with Rance’s mom getting su-
per crabby about their hogging the
phone line because she needs to

call to makeher hair appointment,
they manage to use the Mosaic web
browser and the Gopher protocol
to copy and paste some facts into
Rance’s report — just in the nick
of time, too. '

In another episode, the Tech
Boyzz are at a showing of one of
those asteroid disaster movies
that are all the rage right now. The
movie is okay, but the Tech Boyzz
want to gossip about school stuff.
They try to talk in the theater, but
a jerky grown—up shushes them.
Suddenly Chance has an idea: He
uses his “celly” to send a text to
Lance. OMG! Problem solved.
Score another one for the Tech
Boyzz. , .

And the tech-themed plot lines
go on and on like that. The peda-
gogical value of the show is tre-

COLUMN

’ Courtney Strauss
For The Pitt\News

Many years ago, we might’ve gotten
off the school bus and walked into our
kitchens to ﬁnd our moms foldinglaun-
dryand engr'ossediri‘All My Children.”
Today’sﬁrst graders, however, are more
likely to ﬁnd their mothers riveted by
a “Basketball Wives” rerun. America
seems to have a t1‘ue—story complex.
_ We’re not as interested in the juicy
drama between Leo and Greenlee on
‘All My Children” now that we can

watch the Kardashian sisters go to the

grocery store. We like to watch “real”
people talk about “re ” issues on talk
shows and love to watch “real” people
live their “re ” lives on reality shows.
The problem with this is that these
shows are not real. They’re realish —
which isn’t even a real word.

andtalkshowsarecheaperto produce,
as plummeting ‘All My Children”_ rat-
ings -indicate. Why have the ratings
takenaplunge? Becausewewant“tIue”
This truthiness issue permeates
all art, including movies, music and

. books. Eleven years ago, Dave Eggers

published his memoir, ‘A Heartbreak-
ing Work of Staggering Genius.” He
presented it as “lightly” ﬁctionalized,

butthe bookwas stillaPulitzerPrize,

ﬁnalist in the general nonﬁction cat-
egory. America tends to accept tam-
pered truths as true. V

The beautifully innovative and self-
indulgent book describes Eggers’ life
at age 21 after both of his parents die,
leaving him no choice but to raise his
8-year-old brother. Eggers begins his
memoir with an acknowledgement:
Ifyou are bothered by the idea of this
book being real, you are invited to do

Pretend it’s ﬁction.” It is true. Noth-
ingistruly ﬁct1'onal. Allartisbased on
truths. ‘ ,

Dave Eggers’ screenplay “Away We

.2 , Go” could have been a “true story.” In

fact, I am fairly certain that there is
at least one thirtysomething, unwed

pregnant American couple struggling

' to live a “meaningful’.’ life (the ﬁlm’s

basic plot). Ifthe phrase “true story”
hadbeen slapped onthe movie’s promo
poster, the ﬁlm probably would have
garnered much more popularity. Why?
Maureen Murdockexplainsthiswellin
herbook, “Unreliable Truth.”Murdock
says that when one experiences some-
one’s memoir, “a relationship forms
between the reader and the author and
between the reader and her own life.”

Americans usedtoturntoartasan
escape to see glamorous, outlandishas-
pects oft1'uth.Theywantedto see Susan
Lucci portraying vixen Erica Kane as

to artfor healing and companionship.
When engagingwith media, one wants
to-be assured that his or her time was
spentwitlia“real” person and thatthe

time was used not just for enjoyment V

butalso to provide emotionalbeneﬁts,
like therapy and company. “The great-
est healing may come in knowing that
ﬁ‘orn our sufferingwe have comfort to
offer each other and that we are not, in
fact, alone,” Murdock writes.

Pitt lectiirerjetf Oaks, who taught
an autobiography class here at the
university, offers more insight on our
obsession with reality. Today, when we
wantto take abreakﬁom ourlives with
aitmediums likeTVand books, we are
likely to choose a show like “Interven-
tion” or a book like “Eat, Pray, Love.”

The Eagles dominate Division I hockey. Unfortunately,?t_hat pro-
gram plays in Hockey East and is thus irrelevant to this conver-
sation. In fact, further discussion of Boston College athletics in

general is largely irrelevant.

    

Clemson football is known for the home-ﬁeld advantgel at Memori
Stadium, located in Clemson, S.C. This advantage stems from the fact
" that no road fan has ever successfully navigated to Clemson, S.C.

 

Duke prides itself o its Ivy League standards, which explains why
‘PI _ its football program hasn’t had a winning season since 1994.

    

Starting in 1962, whenever the football program upset an opponent on
the road, the Seminole players removed some grass and added it to their
“sod cemetery” on campus. Since they have ﬁnished in the Top 5 in the
AP Poll every year from 1987 to 2000, they eventually relaxed their sod-
pulling standards to “whenever we want to destroy someone’s Astro’I‘urf.”

  
 

Maryland basketball won the national championship in 2002 but
went 7-9 in the mediocre ACC last year. Fans have also demanded
that the school apologize for the asymmetrical jersey design the

football team wore against Miami last month.

   
   

Last season, starting quarterbackjoshua Nesbitt completed 39

L __For most of this season,-the 

    

en’s_ soccer team has stlrulggled

if ,.,'}*’to' score. Sophomore Nico Wro-
 ﬁvepif the Panthers’ sev-.,
en goals, which mostly came on’

‘ dead-ball situations — not from
perfect passes or sustained off'en-
sive pressure.

A That changed Saturday when
four different Panthers recorded
their ﬁrst point of the season in
the team’s 2-1 come-from-behind

- double overtime victory over the
Syracuse Orange. A

“It took 11 players, plus the
guys that came in,” senior Ryan
Brode said after the game. "It was
really a great win.”

when the Panthers (3-6-1, 1-1-0
Big East) play the Cleveland State
Vikings (3-6-1, 1-1-1 Horizon)
Wednesday at 7 p.m. on Pitt’s up-
per campus, they will look to build

off a conference win in which they ’

scored more than one goal for the
ﬁrst time this season.

Pitt pulled even in conference
play with Saturday.’s double over-
time win after dropping its Big
East opener Sept. 23 at Rutgers,
3-1.

“[Syracuse] was a team effort,”
head coach Joe Luxbacher said
after the game. “The guys played
hard, and they’ve been playing
hard. Last week at Rutgers -

Rutgers is a very good team ——
we were inthe game and made
one mistake, and they scored the
second goal to go ahead. It’s an
evolving process.”

The Panthers are the only team
in the Big East to average under
one goal per game (0.9).

After two games against
conference rivals, Pitt will shift
gears against Cleveland State, a
nonconference opponent hailing
from the Horizon League. Like the
Panthers, the Vikings recorded
a crucial victory last weekend,
when they defeated Milwaukee
3-2 to earn their ﬁrst conference
win and snap a six-game losing
streak.

Admir Suljevic, Aaron Adkins
and Zach Ellis-Hayden scored
the goals on the road Saturday
for the Vikings. The team nearly
let a three—goal lead evaporate by
allowing Milwaukee to score twice
in the ﬁnal four minutes.

Vikings goalkeeper Brad Stuver
had eight saves in the win.

’ Pitt goalkeeper Lee Johnston
had six saves Saturday night
against the Orange to improve to
2-1-1 on the year. Johnston has a
0.76 goals-against average in six
apepeafahces this season, the low-

est of the four Panther keepers ‘

that have seen action.

Butit wasn’t the play in goal
that needed improvement, as Pitt
had réifently struggled to generate

tonight on Pitt’s upper campus.

much on offense.

That changed in the second
half against Syracuse. Freshman‘
forward Chu Chu Onyeukwu
scored the ﬁrst goal of his career
in the 52nd minute. Luxbacher
said that he wasn’t surprised that
Onyeukwu ﬁnally found the net
Saturday.

“Chu Chu had a really good
week of practice,” Luxbacher said.
“He’s a goal scorer, but he’s strug-
gled so far. This week, I thought
he had his best week of practice,
and it showed. He was dangerous
all night.” -_.

In the second overtime, Brode
scored his ﬁrst goal of the season
to win the game when he redi-
rected Ryan McKénzie’s entry
ball past Syracuse goalkeeper
Phil Boerger.

“Ryan Brode puts the team on 3‘
‘ his back,” Onyeukwu said Satur-

day after the game.

Brode led the team last season
with 43 shots, but like so many
Panthers, slumped earlier this
year. ~

“He played a great game,” Lux-
bacher said. “He not onlyscored

. the winning goal, he was winning

balls in the air  He jus/tplayed a
"great game in all aspects.” ’
Wednesday’s game marks the ‘

second of four straight games at
Ambrose Urbanic Field.Pitt be-
gan the season with a four-game
road trip. I

TENNIS

Panthers showoff new

Nathan Barnes
Staﬁ Writer

The Pitt women’s tennis team showcased their
new No. 1 doubles pair lastweek atthe Women’s ‘
Eastern College Collegiate Tournament, held
annually at the U.S. Military Academy in West
Point, NY

The pairing, made up ofsophomore Kimmy
Borza and freshman Molly Wickman, played in
the Honors consolation bracket afteran 8-2 loss
in the second round of the Top—Flight bracket
to Quinnipiac’s second—seeded doubles pair,
Michelle Dassa and Jackie Raynor. Borza and

Wickmanthenstormedthroughtherestoftheir '

competition to winthe Honors bracket and ﬁn-
ish the weekend 4-1 overall. .

“It was different playing with Kimmy, but I
had a lot of ﬁin,” Wickman said. ,“I thought we
did really well, and the match thatwe lost really
could have gone either way.”

No.1 doubles tandem  

will help us become more comfortable here.”

This year, expectations are high for the
team. After having one of their best showings
at this tournament in years, expectations are
evenhigher. ‘

With the impending move to the ACC, the
timing ofthe Panthers’ improvementcouldn’tbe
better. Although the change is afew years down
the road and might not affect every player on
the roster, the move is on the minds of players
and coaches alike. V

“I’m excited about the move. The compe-
tition there is a lot higher, and we’re going to
play the top teams every year,” Molly Wickman
said. “Especially Miami, who won the NCAA
Tennis Championship last year. That level of
competition is going to motivate us and make
us better.”

“It will be awesome. The ACC is arguably
the best tennis conference in the nation, and
that alone is going to help Pitt become a better
program,” Borza added.

It was different playing with Kimmy,
but I had a lot of fun. I thought we  
did really well.
-Molly Wickman

Borza shared similar sentiments about her"
partner.

“Itwas the ﬁrst time we had played together
in a match, but it went really well,” Borza said.
“We complement each other as players, and
we are both very intense. Also, we were able’ to
make adjustments easily as we moved on and
that really helped.” , .

‘ Last season, the Panthers ﬁnished with a
record below .500 forthe ﬁrsttime inﬁve years,
but the ﬁiture remains bright.

Borzaand fellow sophomoreJocelynLuwere
able to establish themselves early on last year,
and are now accompanied by Wickman and

herjtwinsister, Amanda. The twins from Grand V

Rapids, Mich., were both four-star recruits, ac-
cording to tennisrecruitingnet. Not only will
these two players help one another become more
comfortable on campus, but — more impor-
tantly — they will also help the Panthers win
matches. .

“It’s awesome to have my sister here with
me,” Molly said. “We’ve played and practiced
togetherfor ourwhole lives, and we bothwanted
to go to the same school. I love having her here
because we each support each other and [that]

   ,9 

Head coach George Dielfenbach added some
sentiment about the Big East.

“I appreciate all that the Big East has done for
us. We have played inthis conferencefor the ma-
jority of my tenure as coach here,” Dieffenbach
said. “But the ACC has great teams. There are
always teams and players ranked and playingfor
the national championship, and itwill be a great
move for Pitt both athletically and academically.
Mark Nordenberg and Steve Pederson have done

a great job transitioning us, and we appreciate »

their efforts greatly.”

But, before moving to one of tennis’s more
competitive conferences or even on to the of-
ﬁcial season, the Panthers had to competein

lastweek’s tournament. The tournament, which‘ A it

featured singles and doubles play split into two
tiers, gave opportunities forlower-seeded teams
to play up into the higher-seeded brackets.
Borza and Wickman won their ﬁrst match
against a doubles team from Long Island, but
then lost to the Quinnipiac duo 8-2 inthe quar-
terﬁnals. From there, the two took home 8-6
and 8-2 wins over teams from Bowdoin and
Army, respectively. In the ﬁnal game, Borza and

Panthers

enjoy late

tourney

success

Tennis 4 13

Wickman ran roughshod over their competition .

from Albany for an 8-0 victory and the Honors
bracket title.

Other Panthers enjoyed success this past
weekend, including the doubles pairing of senior

. Minh Evans and juniorKarma Parbhu, who de-

feated teams from Rhode Island and Fordham to
reach the B Doubles ﬁnal. However, they fell 9-7
in a tight match to a tandem from Seton Hall.
Sophomore Taylor Washington also reached
a ﬁnal round. While en route to the ﬁnal-match

of the D Singles bracket, Washington upset the '

top—seeded player from Rhode Island, Kathleen
Uy, with a 3-6, 6-1, 10-4 victory. Despite losing
herﬁrst set, Washington rallied inthe secondfor
aconvincingvictory and then dominated again in
the deciding third set. Although Washington did
not see much action last season, all signs point to
her stepping up in a big way this coming year.
‘fltwas great to see her get to the ﬁnals,” Dief-
fenbach said. “She competed to the very end of
the super tiebreak. She played great offensively
and defensively and with a lot of poise.”
Junior Gabrielle Catanzariti, playing in the

B Singles consolation bracket, advanced to the

’ ﬁnals with victories over players from Hofstra,

Sacred Heart and Lehigh. However, Catanzariti
fell in the ﬁnal, 7-5, 6-0, to Taysha Blessingto
of Long Island. - '

Amandawickman represented the Panthers
inthe ﬁnal round other singles bracket. She won
matches against players from Lehigh and Big
East conference mate Providence to reach the
ﬁnals, where she fell in a tough 9-7 game to an
opponent from Sacred Heart.

‘Overall, the‘ Panthers were represented in
ﬁve ﬁnal contests. Despite winning only one of
them, this performance indicates the impres-
sive progress that Pitt tennis has made in the
offseason, as well as the importance of the team’s
new addiﬁons. Additionally, the Panthers had
not enjoyed much success at West Point in the
past, let alone to the degree they experienced
this past weekend. —

“We were close on all of our draws; some of
our matches could have gone either way,” Borza
said. “But we all played well, and the way we
playedwas one of the best showings we had there
inyears.” .

“That is always a good tourney to go to,” Diet‘-
fenbach added. “It is based on individual scoring,
as opposed to team, so that takes alittle bit of the
pressure off. It was a great event. We achieved a
lot of goals there and showed a lot of promise.”
