This traditional fete is given eac

beautiful ritual in which the Queen

New System

The system of selecting the Sen-
ior Queen was a radical change from
the method used in previous years.
Heretofore, the nominating commit-
tee selected only two candidates,
who were elected by majority ‘vote
to the position of Senior Queen.

The system used this year, which
the senior women adopted due to
resolutions from last year’s chair-
man, included the provision that
two elections be held, and that the
ﬁrst be by preferential ballot. This
latter device ..make-s it possible to
nominate more than two candidates,
and ’ thereby better represent true
class opinion.

Mr. James C.
structor in Political Science, ‘super-
intended the method of voting as
well as the counting of ballots.

The winner of next week’s elec-
tion will not be announced in. the
Weekly next week, but will be
named at the annual Tap Day,
May 1.

Pitt Students
Go To Akron

Engineering Collegians’ Will
1 Inspect Huge Airship

 

Tomorrow 235 Pitt engineering
students will leave Pittsburgh via
Pennsylvania Railroad for Akron to
look over the world's largest air-
ship “U. S. S. Akron” which is now
under construction for the United
States Navy at the Goodyear Zep-
pelin Corporation of Akron. Spe-
cial arrangements for transporta-
tion’ both with the Pennsylvania
Railroad Company and the’. Akron
Bus Company have been made.

The train will leave. Pittsburgh at
8:00 o’clock and get into Akron at
11:15. From the railroad station to
the airship’s dock, bus transporta-
tion will be provided. Special ar-
rangements have also been made‘ for
luncheon and dinner at Akron. Then
at 6:10 that evening the train will
leave Akron and be back in Pitts-
bur h at 9:26.

'-s dirigible will be considerably
larger‘ when completed than the
German Graf. The Graf is 776 feet
long, canicarry 3,000,000 -cubic feet
of gas and traveling at a constant
speed of 50 miles per hour will stay
up for a distance of 6,125 miles
while the “U. S. S. Akron” is 785
feet long, can carry 6,500,000 cubic
feet of gas and traveling at a con‘-
stamt speed of 50 miles per hour
will ntay,u,p.f°’ ‘distance of 19.900.
Inside this gigantic airship could
be laid the great Woolworth build-
ing with the Washington monument
thrown in for good measure. Ten
football games could be played in-
side simultaneously. Its height is
equal to that of a. 22-story building.

Due to the necessity of inform-
ing the Pennsylvania Railroad, res-
ervations were made. last Wednes-
day with Mr. Myron Lewis, instruc-
tor in industrial engineering and in
v2h_arge of all arrangements for the
trip. The total‘ number of students
going to Akron includes six from
U-zniontown and ﬁve from Johnstown.
It is the largest excursion ever at-
tempted by either the schools
of engineering or mines, according
to ‘Dean E. A. Holbrook.

Two-Year Lapse

Honor Roll on Page 2 |

Three hundred and twenty-four
undergraduates are included on the
honor roll for the ﬁrst semester of
the present school year as released
this week by J. G. Quick, University
registrar.

Reverting to a former custom af-
ter a lapse of two years, the ad-
ministration has published the pres-
ent list of students possessing the
highest grades upon recommenda-
tion of the Personnel Council of the
University, explained Mr. Quick.

Eighteen students were granted
the designation “With highest hon-
or,” meaning that they possessed a
quality point average of 3.0.

The designation of high honor
students was given to 43 undergrad-
uates who had an average of 2.9,
2.8 or 2.7.

Two hundred and sixty-three stu-
dents were placed on the roll with
the designation of “with honor,”
meaning that they had a scholarship
average ranging from 2.2 to 2.6.

Other interesting statistics re-
vealed in the report of the registrar
showed that the College with an en-
rollment of 1,739 had 180 students
on the honor roll; the engineering

_—._.

school with 597 students placed 39.

on the roll; mines with 116 students
placed seven; school of business ad-
ministration, with a total of 686,
placed 36 students, and the school
of education with 655 students
placed 63.

In publication of the roll, Mr.
Quick called particular attention to
the signiﬁcance of the number of
credits earned byeach student. He
pointed out that this factor offered
the most accurate indication of the
ability of the students.

Engineer Enters Finals In
Bridge Design Contest

Robert M. Morris, a senior in civil '

engineering, has been chosen as one
of ten engineering and architecture
students, picked from hundreds in
United States and Canada who en-
tered, who ,will compete in the fi-
nals of a $500 contest for the best
bridge design. Morris_ and thenine
others will turn in their final com-
plete drawings to the AmericanI-n-
stitute of Steel Construction by May
1 and the winner will be announced
soon after.

Among the hundreds who com-
peted from technical schools in this
country and Canada were three
other Pitt seniors besides Morris.
They were Michael Cozza, Merle
Forst and John Maue. Nine hours
was the most time permitted to
make the preliminary sketches for
the contest. .

In picking the ten best designs,
the jury of award considered those
bridge sketches which appeared 
have the most engineering practi-
bility and architectural beauty. The
jury is composed of two leading
bridge engineers and a noted archi-
tect. Morris, as the Pitt representa-

Winning Limerick Appears In

Pitt poets have had their day!
With the publication of the winning
Limerick in the Weekly “Press”

line to fit a Limerick concocted by a
Pitt student.

The ﬁrst prize was won by David
Lewis, who, after juggling with
anspestic and iambic feet, and with
a. rhyming dictionary on his knee,
wrote the following offering: '

Pitt Poets Versify. “Boys W/ho Dress

Contest

 

Marian Brssecker who wrote the
following limerick:

“What's Up” by the Pitt Cap and Gown
Will soon be appearing in town.
when the bald-headed row

sees the "girls" in the show.

The idea of the contest was to
have a Pitt student write a funny,
catchy limerick about the current
Cap and Gown show. The winning
limerick was to be substituted by
the Pittsburgh Press i-n place of its
regular limerick. The readers of the
paper send in the last line.

With the announcement last week
that the ﬁrst prize was an entire
box of seats for the show, a number
of fraternities decided that writing
limericks would be uplifting, cultur-
ally as well as ﬁnancially. Neigh-
bors of fraternity houses suddenly

began brightening at the unusual -

silence in the neighborhood and be-
gan signing leases for another year.
And librarians were approached by
timid boys who ssked,fo_r sognething

‘to rhyme with “ccclectisism.

Great Interest Is Shown By
Fraternity Boys

 

The boys of a certain fraternity,
however, after becoming bleary-eyed
and weary of thumping out an~apes-
tic feet, resigned like brave men
and purchased seats for Tuesday
night.

The subjects of limericks entered
in the contest ranged from “boys
who sang soprano” to “girls who
chewed tobacco.” That the con-
test was taken good-naturdly by
the Cap and Gown boys is clearly
shown by the fact that some of the
Cap and Gown boys themselves con-
tributed limericks in which they
poked fun at “boys who dress like
girls.”

The ﬁrst prize was an entire box
of eight seats; the second, four box
seats, and the third, two box seats.

burgh Press aided members of the

ly by Jesse Zizmore, Col. ’31, student
complainant, will be started within
the next week, stated John Weber,

more.

Weber said that a. report of the
investigation which will include a
survey of all expenditures and as-

would be immediate reduction in
food prices if the survey shows this
action to be feasible. ‘

Zizmore said that he was conﬁ-

0 student referendum. The proposal’

     
  
  
  
    
   
   

made at a special session late yes-
terday afternoon provides for a com-
plete reorganization of the presents
Council group by enactment of a
constitutional amendment. Council
may amend its constitution by a.
two-third vote of its membership. A
referendum must be held if a peti-
tion signed by one hundred regu-'
larly enrolled students is submitted
to the governing group. 1 . ,
The plan as presented to Council
yesterday by the constitutional eomga 5
mlttee consisting of Naomi Ericson, ..
Ed. ’31; James Perifano, Dent. ’31?;
John Sterling, Eng. ’32, and Cyril
Jacobs, B-us. Ad. ’32, provides for a
council for Pitt men similar to W.
S. G. A. A joint council made up of 
representatives from the Men’s
Council and W. S. G. A. will 
formed to pass on legislation affect-V
ing bo-th men and women students.“
The Men’s Council would be com-.._>é
posed of 20 representatlves in addi-.
tion to the executive oﬂicers. Thir-
teen members would be elected at A
large and seven delegates would ’r'eip~7" ’
resent each of the undergraduate '
school-s, each school being entitledlto
one member. “
Gets First Reading ;,
The plan received its ﬁrst reading
yesterday and will be‘ submittedtp“--:
a second and ﬁnal reading at Counxf
cil’s regular meeting next Wednes-
day evening in Heinz House. A vote '
will be taken at this time and if the
measure is approved it becomes law. 
On the other hand, if a body of»
students are sufficiently interested: in I I
pressing a referendum to the plan, ﬂ
it will be necessary to stage another ,
campus vote where observers 
Council predict that it would be dc-I
feated. ' 
Although similar in structure:ft’o‘.;
the ill-fated M. S. G. A. proposal; [3,
the new plan differs in that it grants '5
equal representation to all camp-us
schools and excludes activities ifrom
representation. ;
Prominent activitiw students re"-
gard this unexpected move of Coun-
cil to show that the legislators are
determined to give up the ﬁght, and
if they cannot set up a new govern-
ment' because of student opposition,
they will resort t-o a constitutio’na.l
amendment. This procedure has not
been used during the life of the
present council. . - _

Coeds Advocate Plan

Principal advocates for the reor-
ganization of the group were the
women delegates, particularly Miss‘
Ericson, Cynthia Dean, Col. ’31, and
Anne Kovach, Ed. '32. A»dela‘ide--
Hunter, Col. ’32,’ the fourthcoed
member of council, was not present
at yeterday’s meeting. Apparentl I
convinced of the success of W. S.’ 
A. in correlating women's activities,
they are seeking to achieve the same:
end for the men. ‘

The answer? Cap and Gown’s twenty-fourth strictly male

(production,

Theater Monday, April 2 with the

County seeing ‘the premiere. After six weeks of

work under William Marlatt, director, the boys on campus learned that
, he life of a “chorus girl” isn’t all orchids and welsh rarebits after the
show. If you’ve seen prominent men on campus limping around and no-

ticed bulges in hip pockets, then
rooms to rub Sloan’s Best into bulg-

 ing calves and collapsing knees.

lVhy Debaters Leave Home

Crowcler, Spirer Recount Tales Of Romance,
Debates In Trip Through East

By WILLIAM THEIS
Professor Farris-h’8 Eastlern-debate team of Edward-T. Crowder J1;-.
Col. ’31, and Jess Spire:-,lCol. ’31, returned early this week from their
tour of the North Atlantic states with many tales of a trip which

they vow surpassed that of their brother debaters on the Western team.

I Spirer, in recounting some of the minor incidents of the tour, began
wz'th‘Ne.w York,.where last Friday and Saturday he and Crowder debated
teams  College of the City of New York and New York University.

Armed;
curiosity ‘that o.nly-months of debate
activity could have developed, the
debaters conquered the Bowery lost
themselves in Wall street and cli-
maxed the morning’s tour b invad-
ing’ Greenwich Village for unch.

There, for the price of la sand-
wich or a plate of hash, Spirer
claims that you may dine in a,cob~
webbed cellar on bare planks, while
a pajama-clad waitress comes to sit
at your side long enough to croon,
“Your order, darling?” and then
skip on to the next plank.

Easter Sunday, the following day,
Splrer and Crowder _made an early
morning tour of Riverside Drive,
and Spirer sums it up with, “mil-‘
lions of -silk toppers and twice that
number of pants that didn’t match

tional-formal morning dress of; the
well-dressed New York man.
Boston hospitality came to the
fore the next morning whenthe de-
baters arrived inthe Hub city. The
group was taken. on a tour of all
the points of historic interest in and
about the famous city. ,
Pictures of the debate party were
taken before Bunker H111 Monu-

of Harvard Universit , Massachu-
setts Institute of Tec nology, and
Radcliﬁe College was made before
the debaters.-retired to prepare for

sentatives of Boston University.’

When Spirer came to speak of the

tant look crept into his eyes and
from time to time’ he was heard to
murmur, “Dear old Christine!”

league in the debate at the women's
institution. Crowder was paired up
with Lois Smith, the second Radcliffe

a ong the lines‘ of an impromptu
speech, each of the, Pitt men having
given his material -to his partner.
It remains a question to be de-
cided between the two men as. to
who actually won the discussion.
Spirer, however, gives the most con-
vincing proof of the two‘ for_ his
claim, saying: “My girl rose, smiled.
we won the debate!”

Mrs. Parrish in Boston, where for

a time the group separated, the Par-

Walter Black Speaks

Mr. Walter Black, of the Juvenile
Court of Pittsburgh; addressed the

«E club members last Wednesday on

“The Present Depression and its In-
ﬂuence on Delinquents.” During the
course of his talk, Mr. Brown
stressed the -fact that the number
of delinquent children has increased
with the unemployment which came
with the depression. Mr. Black re-
viewed the work of the court, citing
its origin and praised the founders
of the movement for the correction
of the socially ill-advised.

“Juvenile Courts have never been
popular -among police,” declared Mr.
Brown. “That is probably because
they tend to take children out of
jails and away, from contact‘ with
the hardened criminal. The funny
thing about the whole thing is that
the «delinquent girls‘ are much worse
than the boys. By the time the
girls come into my care at the Ju-
venile Court they ane too far gone
to be helped in any constructive
manner.” .

April’ is the traditional month of
rain, the pledges of all social so-

actives with an “April Showers Par-

o’clock, ‘at Heinz House. Brilliant
rainbows and large attractive um-
brellas as-' decorations, plus small
celluloid umbrellas as favors helped
to create the wanted “wet atmos-
phere.” Entertainment consisted of
vocal and dance solos and impromp-
tu stunts. Barbara Ann Hartman,

"Den tcuzilii Rescarc/if Worleeri
  Only Woman Delegate

By ETHYI. ‘ SILVERBLATT
The only woman member on the

Council of the International Associa-

tion for Dental Research is a re-

search pathologist at the Dental
school of the University of Pitts-
burgh. Dr. Katherine Dewey is not
at all what one would expect from
the current impression. of a woman
scientist. She is ultra feminine. As
she sits in her office in Lower Dent
discussing the latest problems of
modern medicine and dentistry in
her beautifully accented voice, one
automatically places her in a. sunny
drawinﬁ room ouring tea.

Dr. ewey as had a very full
life. Born in Danzig, Germany, on
the sea, she began, at the age of six,

to attendthe Higher Girls’ School.

“One must,” says Dr. Dewey, “pay
for one’: education from the very
beginning. There are of course, some
free schools for those of a poorer
class, but these schools cover only
four years of technical work.‘ How-
ever it cannot be said that one who

has the ability has no chance”for—

higher education, for at the end of
the four years,‘ tests are given to the
students, and if any show signs of
brilliance’ they are sent on to the
Lyceum,-“if a girl, or the gymnasia, if
a boy, and then to the University, at

the expense of -the state. Education I

is standard in Germany so that a
student can transfer from one school
to another wtihout losing time. The
professors are pensioned, and since
the schools are under the same head
it matters not if'he spends two years
at one school, three at another, etc.
He does not have to spend all his

time in one school to be eligible for-

pension. Germany,” continues Dr.
Dewey, “discourages
athletics. The University requires
two semesters of athletics simply to
develop the body. Don’t you think
it is much better?”
Sails for America

After graduating from the Higher
Girls’ School Dr. Dewey went on to
a seminar for teaching. She taught
for three years and then followed a
younger brother to America. Here,
she met her husband. Their meeting
was just like in a story book. She
had read a book of his and liked it
so much, that she wished to trans-
-late it into the German and give it
to her own people. This necessitated

a number of conferences with Dr.

Dewey, her future husband, and they
came together, they liked,ft_liey loved,
and they married. -For. ﬁve years Dr.

-Dewey, just plain Mrs. Deweyjthen,

lived in .Mid.vi11.e,. Pennsylvania, with

_h.er_husb_and',. Dr. Dewey, .M.D. Her

husband was killed in an.;accide‘nt,

and her baby died. For quite a. while

she was prac_tic_ally,,,an_invalid.' It
was _then.tha.t she de_cided to take‘up
medicine as a_ rofession. Because of
her poor, healt. she went to Geneva,
Switzerland, to begin her study.
While there she climbed‘ the dung-
frau. the second highest. eak in the
world. *- From Geneva 5 e went to

Fellowship for three years, and in
1915 got an appointment as a re-
search pathologist at the College of
Dentistry at the University of II-
linois whereshe remained for twelve
years doing research work and teach-
ingpathology. Dr. Dewey has writ-
ten approximately twenty articles on
various problems of ‘dental pathology
and collaborated on a book on “The
Pathologyof the Mouth” with Dr. F
P. Moorehead. .
. Comes to Pitt

It was after this that she came to
Pitt. Dr. Dewey organized, here, a
section ‘of International.’ Association

for Dental Research which is quite

active. There are about eighteen
members of the Pittsburgh section
of which six are members of the na-
tional. Before“ being admitted to na-
tional the prospective’ member must
have "done one original piece of re-
search work and published a paper
on it. -

In the early part of August, Dr.
Dewey will be a delegate to the na-
tional annual convention in Paris,
where thirty-eight. nations will be
represented. The question up before
the group is that of the pulpless
tooth, that from which the nerve has
been removed. A prize of $1,000 and
a gold medal who can present the
best method for root canal treat-
ment. Seventeen thousand references
have already been ‘submitted.

Dr. Dewey has traveled extensive-
ly. She has visited every European
country but Greece, and hopes to see
that before she dies.

Quax Meets Today
To Elect Officers

Quax, women’s scientiﬁc frater-
nity, will meet todayat 12:30 o’clock
to elect officers for the coming year
and to close all business for this
year. Candidates for the presidency’
are Vivian Crawford, Mathematics,
and Frances Brahm, Biology. Adele
Sismondi, Zoology, has been nomi-
nated for corresponding secretary,
Alyce Chalker, Chemistry». for re-
cording secretary, and Grace Riddle,

then, it has grown remarkably; and
although it is still a local organi-

it into a national fraternity are
promising.

the completion of two years of
school, with a B average in the ma-
jor subject and a C average other-
wise. -

_ DID YOU EVER make three B's

a pencil to scribble a note home to

the expected pecuniary remunera-

  Summoning

The chemist Van Hclmont in 1609 discov-
ered an invisible substance, an emanation
from coul,'that he named “gcist,” meaning
ghost, shortened in English to gas.

Only now do its miraculous possibilities
begin toibc glimpsed.
crn industry, like a latter-day Aladdin rub-

- bing his lamp to summon a vaporous genii,
turn a valve and order this Ghost to any
one of a hundred tasks. '

From the beginning, the problem was one
of piping. When Crane Co., a half century
ago, set: itself to develop and produce the
right materials for every gas and oil purpose,
it began an incalculably valuable contribu-
tion to the solution of problems that had
held back the gas industry since the Chinese

So in the development of the natural and
manufactured gas industry, as in practically
every other industry, the Crane line of
valves, ﬁttings, fabricated piping, and
specialties have played an important part.
No matter what branch of industry you
enter, you will ﬁnd Crane materials playing
a similarly important part.

Leading Activity

PITT ATHLETIC TEAMS have long occu-
pied a conspicuous place in the world of

Pitt educational standards -are

for their progressiveness and completeness;
Pitt has an enrollment that places it twelfth

the nation’s universities, and

Pitt has an alumni that numbers among its
members some of the outstanding contributors
to modern business and aesthetic life. A

It is_only natural, therefore, that in dramatic
actlvltles Pitt is to be found among the leading

country. The Cap and Gown

Club, the annual production of which is to be
staged next week, was recently selected by a

to be one of the seven leading

college dramatic organizations.

Cap and Gown has had a continued growth
and success since its ﬁrst presentation twenty-
four years ago.

Its beginners were insigniﬁ-
it ranks as one of the major

activities of the year, combining fun, experi-
ence and opportunity for its members. .Sup-
ported by a falthfulialumni and held in high
regard by the student body, Cap and Gown "is
truly a Pitt institution.

Mr. Charles Doud-s, of the nation-

who accompanied the students, re-
marked, “Such a project is of real
signiﬁcance.”

' ‘S. Clayton Newman, Col. ’31, pres-
ident of the Y.’ M. C. A., reports:

‘ “We restricted our group to twenty

people at the request of the‘ peni-
tentiary and court officials, and it

dcubtedly one of the most instruc-
tive and important projects of the
‘Y’ this year.” '

The Pre-Dental Spring Frolic
which was held in the Hotel Schen-
ley, April 11, attracted 175 couples,

the trial enclosure shuffle, the six
tooth grind, and the spatulating
shove.

The guest list included Dean H. E.
Friesell, Dr. F. C. Friesell, Dr. John

Sahib Jack Allen, “What’s Up?”
leading femme, was the goat of a
practical joke which we cannot keep
secret any longer. At an off campus
April Fool Party recently, where
Jack was a guest, the host had wised
a neighbor to rap on the door at a
certain hour, and protest vigorously
about the noise. Of course, it was all
in fun, and after he had created suf-
ficient disturbance, the neighbor was
to yell, “April Fool.” The zero hour
came; the neighbor came. Jack took
the neighbor’s insinuations as. per-
sonal reﬂections on himself. Before
the nei hbor had time“to shriek
“April ool,” Jack had his coat off,
and sleeves rolled. Nine guests held
Mr. Allen while the neighbor, es-
caped pronto up the avenue.

“Neither the faculty club mem-

rooms in the basement of the Schen-

president of the Faculty Club, de-

“When the headquarters for the
faculty club were in the old build-
ing on top of the hill near the sta-
dium, student organizations and
faculty members held many different
social events there and at present
our temporary quarters in the

Before Bizads

Guest At Weekly Luncheon
Of Alpha Kappa Psi

 

 

The third of a series of four talks
on the general topic, “Legal Control
‘of Business,” will be given at the
weekly luncheon of Alpha Kappa
Psi, professional business fraternity
in Hotel Roosevelt, Tuesday April
21, at 12:15 o’clock, by Miles H.
Jones, instructor in business law 1n
the school of business administra-
tion. Mr. Jones will talk on“ “Legal
Control of Public Utilities.” J. ‘C.
Mcllwane, assistant school s_o1icto-r
of Pittsburgh, will act as. chairman.

At the meeting last week Mr.
Jones discussed “Corporation De-
velopment.” Reminding _the mem-
bers that in a previous talk he had
pointed out how the law has at-
tempted a difficult task of encour-
aging the development of business
within the respective states and pro-
tecting both stockho-lders and cred-
itors against a too enthusiastic and
rapid growth ofbusiness, the speak-

er cited another illustration in the"

handling of the Uniform“ Conditional
Sales Act of the State of Pennsyl-
vama.
Error Causes Indignation
Mr. Jones showed how the Act was
incorporated in the laws of Penn-
sylvania without. notice being ‘given
at the time that bailment leaseswere
included in-it. When the mistake was
discovered, business indignation rose
to a high pitch because now this
would mean that bailment leases
would have to be’ recorded and it did
not take to the length of time of the
next legislation to correct this er-
ror by amending the Act and ex-
ressly withdrawing the bailment
ease.
Asking the listeners to place them-
selves in the position of trustees of
a modern corporation which has met

with keen competition and whose
only salvation appears to enlarge

the plant and cut down the cost, the
speaker showed how the only hope
lay in a merger.

Another company is interested in
acquiring the plant ahd the trus-
tees know that if ‘they successfully
conduct themselves in the next few
monthsin a year, they will be" able
to obtain a very ﬁne exchange basis
for their stock. The one and only
result, the . speaker asserted, . would
be to run" the price’ of their stock
up on the market and so liatu-rally

they would decide to build a large

surplus.

These luncheons, sponsored by
Alpha Kappa Psi, are open to any
interested faculty members and stu-
dents. The meetings close promptly
at 1:30 o’clock. 1' The price of the
vluncheonis eighty-ﬁve cents. No ad-
vance reservationsure necessary.

ministration, and Mr. John M. Fitz.-.

Cture would be built at this location.

The excavating work, which was
started on November 5, was ﬁnished
in March and the foundation is now
being constructed. In all, 97,000
cubic yards of soil was removed.

According to the report the erect-
ing of this ediﬁce will require about
two years’ time, and the completed
building will furnish the Institute
with the means forexpanding great-
ly its research facilities and activi-
ties.in both pure and applied sci-
ences. The structure, which will be
of that type of classical Greek arc_hi-
tecture known as Ionic, will be built
of granite and Indiana limestone
and will be surrounded by 62 m-on.o-
lithic columns. The proportions of
the -building will be approximately
300 feet by 275 feet, and it will in-
clude eight working ﬂoors, four of
which will be underground.

The report also stated that the
publications by members of the In-
stitute. during the year 1930 in-
cluded one book, ﬁve bulletins, 45

research reports and 44 other pa-.
Sixteen U. S. patents and 13.

pers.
foreign patents were issued to fel-
lowship incumbents.

Throughout the year 76 industrial

fellowships were in operation. Thir-
ty-one fellowships have been in
operation for ﬁve years or more,
and of this number 18 have con-
cluded more than 10 years of work.
Three or more new fellowships will
begin operation during the early
part of the present ﬁscal year when
laboratory space is available.

Varsity Spiikers Open
Season With Ohio State

Pitt's varsity track team will open its outdoor season tomorrow after-
noon when it meets Ohio State at Columbus. Ohio State will be a favorite

to cop the meet even though

it will be without the services of George

Simpson and Dick Rockaway, two internationally known stars who repre-
sented it against the Panthers last year at the stadium. Pitt also will
compete minus several stars of last year's team, including Pete Bowen,

Ed Knobloch, Jim Jerpe and Bob Alberts who graduated

last June. In

addition, Coach Shea’s men wereo

considerably-weakened by the loss
of Bill Miller and Cornell Cooper of
last year’s yearlings who dropped
out of school due to scholastic diffi-
culties.

Everett Utterback, all-around Pitt
star, will carry the brunt of the at-
tack of the Panthers. Everett will
compete in the 100-yard dash, the
broad jump, the high jump, the pole
Valtllt, the low hurdles and the shot
pu .

Everett's specialty is the jumps,
but inasmuch as Pitt is weak in t e.
other departments, he will attempt
to perform the iron man stunt in an
effort to swing the score in Pitt's
favor. Everett ran the century in
10 flat early in the week, the best

_ he has ever done for that distance.

Vitulla. and Woodie Harris,.who

‘-ran second to Bowen in most of last

year’.-. races, will also represent the
Panthers in the sprints. Mo-nheim
will run in the quarter along with
Harris.

Jim Watkins, former P‘ R. R. star,
will be Pitt's hope in thehalf mile
Clise and Mazzei
will run with him in the latter event,

« leaving Smoyer and Caesar for the

two-mile race. Caesar covered this
distance in 10 minutes, 13 seconds in
the time trials on Tuesday.
Marshall Lewis, who was ineligible
last year, will run in the hurdles
events.‘ Linwood Thiessen, a sopho-
more, was also to have com ted but
he was declared ineligible t "s week.
Connell and McConnell will help
Utterback in the pole vault and

Lewis will compete with him in the
high jump. ‘Campi is entered in the
broad jump.

Luch, Carver and Kopnicki will be
Pitt's weightmen. Luch will throw
the hammer and discus and put the
shot. Carver will participate in the
latter two events, while Kopnicki
will conﬁne his efforts to the ljavelin
throw.

- ' Beetham
the better

Hanoverand Keller are
known Buckeye represen-
tatives.

Beetham. represented the all-
American track team which met a
picked British team last summer in
an international meet. He is the
national junior half mile champion.

Keller, although only a. sopho-
more,-showed great-form during the
past indoor season and gave Leo
Sentman of Illinois several close
races during the year. Keller may
compete in the dashes as well as in
the hurdle races.

Hanover won the mile race
against the Panthers last year in 4
minutes, 27 seconds. He is expected
to show improved form this year.

Other Ohio representatives will be
Bennett, Bloor, Teitlebaum and
Strothers, a Beaver Valley boy, in
the sprints; Dill and White in othe
2-mile race and Hockmuth in the
jumps.

’ The lone department in which the
Buckeyes have a noticeable weak-
ness is in the weights but since the
Panthers are also ‘weak here, com-

petition may be close. '

succumbed to spring fever’, ‘the’  ‘d-
man have been out on the sta um
lot, working ‘hard, perspiring freely
and probably wishing that the cool
days of autumn would soon roll
around. _

The reason for this sorry plight
of the husky football players is the
fact that Jock Sutherland, head
football coach, has been taking hap-
py advantage of the warm weather
and has ‘had the grid squad out the
last week, scrimmaging and playing
ﬁercely. ‘

Sutherland has been stressing the
fundamentals during the entire
spring practice. He has the men

racticing charging, blocking, tack-
hing and other details of offensive
and defensive play. The coach has
been spending a. great deal of time

' in drilling the players in aerial de-

fense, in which the Pitt teams of
past years have been notably weak.

Probably the most noticeable
weakness of the Pitt team at the
beginning of ractice was the lack
of a capable 'cker. As a result,
Sutherland has had several poten-

tial punters out since the beginning
of the practice, keeping them work-
ing steadily at booting the ball.
Among. these are Rocco Custri and
Zola Alpert, Baker’s understudies at
quarterback last year; “Shanty” Ho-
gan and Gelini from last year’s
freshman team; “Rip” Collins and
several others.

In one respect, Sutherland is
rather glad that the weather has
been so ‘hot. A great many of the
men, especially some of last year's
freshmen team, reported to practice
carrying a great deal of excess
weight. Lately, however, under the
rays of the hot sun, the extra pound-
age has been meltin-g away and the
men have been getting into the best
possible condition.

Despite the fact that the spring
practice is-nearing a conclusion, very
few positions -have beonclinched and
in some spots, a merry battle is be-
in‘ waged’ for the right of being
ca led a. member of the first team.
However, this is not strange, con-
sidering - the generally high calibre
of the "competing players, and it is
quite likel that a deﬁnite first team
lineup wil -not be decided upon un-
til very shortly» -before the first game
in the fall.

Loses To George D
South Golf

Dunlap Jr., Princeton student and

match Parks was only two down “and
his chances for victory were bright,
but the Princeton youth was some-
what steadier and won out. It was
raining during the day and greens
were wet, causing Parks more trou-
ble than it did Dunlap. As far as the
drivin and approaches were con-
cernedf the Pitt captain seemed the
equal of his opponent.

In order to gain the ﬁnals Parks
had to mow his way through a group
of the best amateurs in the country.
After playing in the qualifying
round with Eugene Homans, who

teur meet last year and who, since
the retirement from amateur com-
petition of Bobby Jones and George
Von Elm, is possibly the ranking si-
mon pure in the United States. Parks
met and defeated B. W. Corkran of
Baltimore. Following this, Forbes
Wilson, Yale number one man an
Maine amateur champion, was over-
come two and one. Then, in the semi-
ﬁnal round, the Pitt captain met T.
Suffran Taylor Jr.,,of Princeton, and,
after a. difficult ﬁght, came through
with a two and one victory.

The defeat of Parks by Dunlap
was the second one within a year.
Last season in the national intercol-
legiate matches, played here at Oak-
mont, Parks was downed by Dunlap.
three and two, in the quarter-ﬁna
round of the tournament. Before his
loss to Dunlap, Parks had played
brilliantly, leading the ﬁeld at the
end of the ﬁrst 18 holes of the quali-
fying round and making the third
best qualifying score.

Sam Parks Jr., captain of the

nated Parks in the national inter-

summer at Oakmont.

Frosh Netters
Vie For Berths

Jacobs, Ganger, De Witt and
Schwartz Candidates

 

The Pitt freshman tennis team is
looking forward to a succes~sful‘te.n-
nis campaign this year. As it looks
now, Pitt will have one of the out-
standing freshman tennis teams in
the country.

Last year’s frosh team had a fair
season and was unfortunate in los-

ing two of its matches. The 1930
frosh. team was made up of Bill
O’Loughlan, ranking 17th junior in
1930; Zola Alpert, Tatala, Robert
Janks, n-ow at Syracuse; Sol-ow and
J. H. Friedman. O’Loughlan, Al-
pert, Solow and Tatala are candi-
dates for this year’s varsity team.
All the members «of the squad have
had tournament experience which
will be a great help for future play.
The outstanding and most promis-
ing men who are out for the team
are: “Bill” Jacobs, former 1929 jun-
ior indoor champion, brother of “Ed-
die” Jacobs, Pitt varsity tennis cap-
tain and ranking men's player in
the United State-s; Nathan Ganger,
ranking 11th junior in tennis circles.
He will be battling with “Billie” Ja-
cobs for the number one position on
the team.
While these junior tennis stars are
ﬁghting for positions, the other par-
ticipants will have -to ﬁght it out
among themselves for the other po-
sitions. Albert Schwartz, 2;, product
from Bridgeport, Connecticut, will
compete for the third singles. Merle
Goldstein, McBride, member of the
frosh basketball team, John DeWitt
and Gannon are the other candidates
for the frosh team.
To meet the test of these stars,
James “Whitey” Hagan, assistant
athletic director of the University
of Pittsburgh, has arranged a for-
midable schedule. The schedule is
as follows:
April 25--Washington and Jeffer-
son, stadium.
May 8——Duquesn.e, stadium.
May 9-—-Washington and Jeffer-
son, Washjngton, Pa. .
May 15--Duquesne, Duke courts.
May 16-California State Teach-
ers, stadium. ..
May 18.--Carnegie Tech, stadium.

Successful Election

The distinguished thing about
the election which took place
for the women was the location
of it. There was practically
nothing out of the ordinary, or
different from other years, in
the way the votes were handled
by Senior Court. Hermine Ru-
of, Col. ’31, chief justice of the
601111. says: “Everything went
smoothly, the votes we re
counted by nine o’clock of the
same ‘day’, and we have had no
complications so far.”

But this smoothness was the
result of holding the election
outdoors on the Heinz House
boardwalk, away from the pell-
mell of Alumni Hall, and away
from the men. Votes for choices
of candidates wei-en’t disturbed
by confusion or disorder.

There was no unconsidered
hurry. or headlong decisions.
Men didn’t have the chance to
persuade or to attract. Know-
ing_ this, the women should be
satisﬁed that the new officers
are the ones who were the most
wanted for the jobs.

Mark Dance Program

At .Coed Dance Night held last
Wednesday evening in the Frick
Training school auditorium, approxi-
mately ﬁve hundred were present.

Among the unusual dances was
the Spring Song dance by Hilda Ru-
bin, Ed. ’32, in which she interpreted
a dressed llp doll of the gay nine-
ties with all bhe clever tricks of
modern dancing. Another feature
on the program was the Hungarian
Rhapsody by Adelaide Hunter, Ed.
’32, dressed in gay colors and re-
vealing every art of Hungarian
dance.‘ ‘

Coed Dance night was the ﬁrst at-
tempt ever made by W. A. A. to
hold a Spring recital, and probably
will become an annual event in the
Association’s program. The pro-
ceeds from the affair will be spent
for W. A. A. Play Day, scheduled
for May 8. ’

The committees who served for
Coed Dance night under Mrs. Fran-
ces Tracy, director, consisted of:
program, Gretchen Brooks, Ed. ’32;
tickets, Charlotte Mady, Ed. ’33;
publicity, Isabelle Murphy, Ed. ’34;
candy, Lillian Hoar, Ed. ’34; post-
ers, Elizabeth Kuhlman, Col. ’33;
costumes, Mary Kovacs, Ed. ’32;
tryouts, Jean Howard, Col. ’34;
stage managers, Elizabeth Davis,
