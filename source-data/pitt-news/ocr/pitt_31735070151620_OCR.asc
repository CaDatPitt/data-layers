Vania State Department of Edu-
cation and the U.S. Department
of Education. It was founded by
Trombetta in 2000.

According to a statement the
ofﬁce of U.S. Attorney for the
Western District of Pennsylva-
nia David Hickton released Fri-
day, Trombetta is charged with
diverting more than $8 million
from the company over a six-
year period that began in 2006.

Although the charges, if
proved true, will cast a shadow

over Trombetta and his PA Cy-‘

ber Charter School, the man and
his enterprise were still well-
respected in 2012 when Pitt’s
School of Education publicly
honored him.

In March 2012,‘Trombetta
received the School of Educa-
,tion’s Pre K-12 Educator Award
for his achievements in educa-
tion. Trombetta obtained a doc-
torate degree from the School of
Education in 2000, making him
eligible for the Alumni Awards
program.

Pitt spokesman John Fedele

would not know-

declined to comment on the al-
legations against Trombetta.
Alan M. Lesgold, dean of
Pitt’s School of Education,
presented the award to Trom-
betta on March 23, 2012. At
the time, the school had seen
no evidence that he was any-
thing but a respected educator.

. Lesgold denied knowledge of

Trombetta’s connection to any
alleged criminal ac-

include more than 10 years of
experience in Pre K-12 educa-
tion in addition to personal
achievement, public service and
a continued commitment to the
advancement of the School of
Education and the University
of Pittsburgh. '

“He seemed to be widely’
respected as a colleague by
superintendents in western

todian of the public trust, re-
ceiving public funds,” Hickton
said. “These charges reﬂect our
obligation to protect the educa-
tion of children, who are our fu-
ture, and to protect the compact

with hardworking taxpayers.”
Prence_is charged with help-
ing Trombetta in these activi-
ties. The two men allegedly
concealed where the funds were
going by falsifying

tivity when he pre-

sented the award to

Trombetta in 2012.
“We certainly

ingly give an award
to someone who did
not lead an exem-
plary ethical life,”

“These charges reflect our
obligation to protect the
education of children...”

- Trombetta cre-

source and amount
_of his income so he
could evade taxes,

Lesgold said in an
email.

Awards are issued by a small
committee that includes alum-
ni of the School of Education.
Trombetta was nominated by
department chairs and other
alumni in order to be consid-
ered. Usually, only one person
receives this award each year,
depending on the number of
nominees. V

The criteria for the award

observations at superintendent
events that Pitt tries to sup-
port,” Lesgold said.

Hickton said the state pur-
sued the charges against Trom-
betta because of the damage it
inﬂicted on Pennsylvania citi-
zens.

“As the founder and CEO of
PA Cyber, Trombetta was a cus-

according to the
indictment. . He
founded the National’Network
of Digital Schoolsin 2005 to
manage PA Cyber.‘Trombetta
served as superintendent at PA
Cyber and president at NNDS.

» He later stepped down from

his position as president in
June 2oo7. In 2003, Trombetta
co-founded the Buckeye On-
line School for_Success, known
as BOSS. In 2006, he founded

ated connected '

One20ne Enterprises with his
sister, Elaine Trombetta Neill.

In 2008, Trombetta created the

Avanti Management Group, a
for—proﬁt consulting company

. that provided education man-

agement support. -
Tronibetta retired as th
chief executive officer of PA
Cyber in June 2012. The fol-
lowing month, the FBI raided
its offices, according to Chris-
tina Zarek, a spokeswoman for
NNDS who also speaks for PA
Cyber Charter School. She said

the investigation surrounding

Trombetta’s supposed activi-
ties went public shortly after
his retirement: .

Trombetta and Prence have
been released on $50,000 un-
secured bond. Their attorneys
pleaded not guilty on behalf of
their clients at the arraignment
Wednesday morning. ChiefU.S.
Districtjudge Joy Flowers Conti
was assigned the case..

Trombetta faces a maximum
sentence of 100 years in prison
and a $3.25 million ﬁne. Prence
faces up to ﬁve years in prison
and a $250,000 fine.

ernet cable limited students’ Internet
access to as far as the cord could reach,
which in many casesis only the length of
a desk. This immobility presented an ob-
stacle to students, especially in Holland
Hall, where the bnly lounge is located on
the top ﬂoor.

Annie Yoon, a junior Studio Arts and
Biology major who previously lived in
Sutherland and Ruskin halls before mov-
ing off campus, noted that the limitations
of an Ethernet cord restricted her online
experience. .

“When my physical activity range was
limited by the length of an Ethernet cable,
it was certainly not a pleasant experience.
Sometimes, I wanted to use my laptop on
my bed or bring it to a lounge, not only
on my desk,” she said in an email. “Now
that we have Wi—Fi, I could even easily
bring my laptop to anywhere around the
campus, let it be a classroom, dining hall
or a friend’s dorm, to work on whatever

assignment I have.”
The University spent an up—front
capital cost on both equipment and in-

‘ stallation, and will additionally pay for

ongoing operational costs, Fedele said.

“The University anticipates and bud-
gets for these types of upgrades to meet
the needs of our University community,”

Fedele said.

Wi—Fi in dorms was one of Student
Government President Gordon Louder-
back’s initiatives during his 2011 cam-
paign. He noted the prevalence of Wi—Fi
at other universities.

“It was reasonable to ask because oth-
er schools have it and it allows people to
visit other peoples’ rooms and complete

classwork together and collaborate,”

Louderback said.

A He also discussed the additional ben-

eﬁts spurred by the Wi—Fi installation, in-
cluding increased ﬂexibility and mobility.

“It makes students feel more comfort-
able living in residence halls. It keeps Pitt
up with the technology that other schools
are offering,” he said. I

“The test was way too hard. Ev-

Unless you went to a very ex-

picked up this defense mechanism
sometimein middle school to jus-
tify a particularly unimpressive
grade. After the third or fourth
time, however,-your parents prob-'
ably stopped listening.

V’ These results could prove
fatal for these Common Core
standards, which have already
received their fair share of criti-
cism from commentators across
the political spectrum.

The strengthened skepticism
toward the standards themselves,
however, gmisplaces the concern.
Rather than drawing theold “un-
fair test” conclusion from the
results, parents and educators
should come to realize that now
more than ever old, st’ate—spe'c'iﬁc

Department of Education have tirelessly
defended the eiforts through their “Race
to the Top” program, which disburses fed-
eral funds to states that introduce “inter-
nationally benchmarked standards and
assessments” —— the lor°1g way of saying
“Common Core.”

But after the dismal results from New
York City’s much-publicized experiment
with the tests, some states and educators
are starting to reconsider them. Indiana
and Michigan have begun political pro-

ceduresto review their involvement in 7

the program; ‘

This possible setback would only con- ‘
tribute to the mounting discrepancies _i

between the United States’ education
system and those of the most. successful
developing countries. ‘ _
No conversation about education
reform can last long without someone
quoting the most recent statistic disap-
pointingly comparing American students’
performances to their international

peers. Ascending the educational ladder
to a position suitable for the wealthiest
nation in the world, however, requires far
more than rhetoric on high expectations
— especially when those expectations
differ drastically from school to school
and from student to student.

It would be difﬁcult to imagine how
teachers across the nation could hold
their studentsnto the same expectations
when local, state and federal govern-
ments invest in their students at such
wildly different rates. The Council on For-
eign Relations recently concluded from a
study of international education systems
that the-drastic differences in per-pupil
fuvnding. across the United States con-
tribute signiﬁcantly to the nation’s poor
student performance.

With the more limited ﬁnancial sup-
port for schools that educate poorer
students, teachers in these areas have
neither the funds nor the encouragement
to hold their students to expectations as
demanding as those for better-ﬁnanced
students.

The Common Core standards, then,
present a partial solution to this dilemma.

By holding all students to a universal and
measurable standard, educators can sup-
port teachers to maintain the highest

expectations for those students who need '

it most. By providing a curriculum de-
signed primarily for=college preparation,
teachers will be able to better clear a path
to higher education for students from
backgrounds in which that result is all
too often unexpected. And by providing
data on student success to policymakers,
the tests would — ideally — illustrate
the need for more equitable funding to
the schools that need it most.

Politicians’ recent track records when
it comes to testing and funding, however,
are no comfort to those who worry that
these test results will become another
tool for schools and governments to ﬁre
teachers and deny funds. '

In addition to adopting Common Core
standards, the Department of Education
also encourages states to implement test-
based teacher evaluations with the carrot
of federal “Race to the Top” money. Con-
sidering the deplorable performance on
these tests, schools will soon have some
newly acquired ﬂexibility to ﬁre teachers

as they see ﬁt.

By tying teachers’ futures to the results
of a rigorous and novel test, schools and
governments are only contributing to the
rising classroom paranoia surrounding
standardized tests.

Not only does this anxiety discourage
teachers from curricular creativity, but it
also mischaracterizes the Common Core
standards as a miracle cure for all the ail-
ments of any school. Test scores will not
magically skyrocket after the ﬁrst year’s
rocky introduction. Just as anything in
education, it will require years of consis-
tent effort to even marginally improve.
Firing teachers if their students’ scores
do not immediately improve will only
hinder the process.

It will take policymakers decades to
correct the inadequacies of the educa-
tion system. And though Common Core
standards are a step in the right direction,
major improvementﬁlwill require a host

- of other structural reforms. Hopefully,

through their solutions, politicians will
be able to demonstrate their own “high-
order thinking” skills. I

FlLM REVIEW

Woody Allen
returns to
his old ways

Matt Singer
Senior Sta‘/j’ lVrz'ter

“Blue Jasmine”
Directed by:
Woody Allen
Starring; Alec
Baldwin, Cate 
Blanchett

Grade: B-

After two movies set in Europe,
Woody Allen takes viewers back
stateside in his new ﬁlm, “Blue Jas-
mine.” Once there, we are invited
to watch Cate Blanchett drown her
sorrows in anti—anxiety medication
and Stoli while living in her sister’s
crummy apartment in San Francisco.
And boy, are viewers supposed to feel
bad for her. '

Or are they?

One of the most interesting
things about Allen’s latest movie
is that it’s difficult to tell how ex-
actly you’re supposed to perceive
Blanchett’s character,]asmine. She’s
every stereotype about Upper—East—
Side bourgeois made manifest. Too
stupid to realize that her husband —~
Alec Baldwin’s smooth—tall<ing Hal
— is making his millions through
a Ponzi scheme, she sips martinis
overlooking the beach, in part will-
fully ignorant of Hal’s shady deal-
ings, but also partly clueless to their
signiﬁcance.

The few snippets of Hal explain-
ingto his sonthe moral beneﬁts of al-
truism serve as an ironic contrast not
only to his thieving Ponzi scheme,
but also to the fact that his wife is
more concerned with saving face

‘Daily Show’ Correspondent
Al Madrigal discusses his early
  days in stand up.‘

John Lavanga
A£°5’E Editor

For the past two years, comedian and
actor Al Madrigal has been a contribu-
tor on The Daily Show withjon Stewart,
traveling the nation and interviewing
some of its strangest thinkers and activ-

ists. As a stand-up comedian, however,

he broaches subjects closer to home,

ranging from ‘buying a house at the”
height of the housing bubble to watching-

the magic that is gang members explor-
ing a waterfall.

Tomorrow, he’s coming to the First
Niagara Pavilion as part of the Oddball
Comedy and Curiosity Festival tour, and
he took the time to speak with The Pitt
News by phone aboutmaking his way
into the world of stand-up comedy.

TPN: You’re on a comedy megatour
right now with Flight of the Conchords,
Dave Chappelle and other big names, but
you’ve been in comedy for 15 years. How
does this differ from the early days? V

Al Madrigal: The biggest difference
is people actually want to see you.

When you first start out, you’re just
surprising people with comedy. I re-
member there was this horrible run

of gigs in the San Francisco Bay area:

where it’s called a triple run. You go
out and you do a string of bars that is
set up, and, you know, you go through

Weaverville, Calif., and you hit all these ‘V
spots. You’re in venues not suitable for

comedy and you’re going through and
surprising people with comedy. Some-
times it can begreat. Sometimes, the
basketball machine is on and there’s a

video arcade next door or a pool hall.’

It’s really night and day.
TPN: Would you say it’s harder when
you’re first starting out and trying to

surprise people, or is it harder when

you have a pressure to perform for an

audience that expects a lot from you‘?
Madrigal: Both stages pose differ-

ent problems. First, you have to prove

yourself to people who don’t know who ~

i‘ you are, and that’s a serious challenge.

But I remember Michael Richards
used to look at all ofus at The Comedy
Store who were unknowns killing and
be pissed. Be furious. Because he would
get huge, huge, huge applause. A ton of
people would go insane to see Kramer.

31 mean just out of their seats. He’s one
the best sitcom characters of all time
standing in front of you and there’s ten
rows in the place to speak of. And then
jafter three minutes he’d start eating it,
because his act wasn’t very good.

With us, you’d go up and everyone
would not react at all or give just a cour-

Atesy applause. Then you’d prove yourself

and by the end they’re clapping for you
like they were for Kramer when he ﬁrst
got up. With him it’s difficult because
you need to produce; When you’re start-
ing out  you need to introduce yourself.
You’re not under quite so much pressure
to produce quality material. But_I don’t
think it ever gets easy.

TPN: You signed a talent-holding deal
with CBS in,2oo4 and landed a role in a
show called Welcome to3The Captain in
2007. But the show only aired for five
episodes because of the writer’s strike.
Was that discouraging? ° .

Madrigal: I heard this great quote
from, I think it was from Neil Patrick
Harris who had some old executive on
[“Doogie Howser, M.D.”] tell him that,
“Riding Hollywood, it’s like you’re a
surfer and you just catch waves and
you enjoy the wave while you’re on it.”
Whether it’s Seinfeld, The Mary Tyler
Moore Show or Welcome to the Cap-
tain, just ride it for 100 episodes or five
episodes. Have a good time, then just
paddle back and go get another one. So
I’ve tried toihave that attitude.

TPN: When you go out into the ﬁeld
for The Daily Show, you get to do some
crazy things.

Madrigal: I’ve driven tanks and
swam with manatees. It’s pretty weird.

BLUE UASMINE

than giving her lower-middle-class sister,
Ginger (Sally Hawkins), the time of day.

The importance that Jasmine places on
her reputation — which sheis horriﬁed of
tarnishing — is most obvious when Ginger
comes to New York City to visit._]asmine can’t
really understand why Ginger isn’t satisﬁed
with the lavish itinerary she has lined up for
her sister. Ginger wants her sister to show her
around and take her shopping, and although
the richer half of the duo ﬁnally consents, she
frowns the whole way through. Gingefs glee
and wonder so strongly irkjasmine that it’s
clear she can’t understand or relate to anyone
who isn’t already a part of her opulent little
world.

When the roof inevitably comes falling
down on her life, Jasmine becomes the so-
cialite-tumed-pauper that deﬁnes her on-
screen character for the vast majority of the

ﬁlm. Thisessentially makes “Blue Jasmine” -

a movie about loss and dealing with picking
up the pieces after some sort of calamity. And
that’s all ﬁne and good —— but themes like that
don’t really reek of late-career Allen, whose
dilemmas can be happily resolved by tying a
happy little bow on the ending.

In fact, this movie seems Very much like
an early—career Allen and carries all the ex-
istential neuroses that come along with the
territory. It shows the fragility of stability
and howeasy it is‘ to lose everything. It’s also
an exploration of what to do when you’re at
the bottom, what to do when you meet the
boti;om- dwellers that reside there and how to
accept yourselfwhen you become one.

Jasmine gets a crash course in all those
things. _ *

Although she may sound endearing at
times, it is often hard to pity Jasmine. She
would rather devote her time and energy to
ﬁnding awealthy man to spoil her than pulling
herselfup by her bootstraps, so to speak. She’s

whiny, neurotic, chiding and condescending.
Allen has embodied all these traits in char-
acters he, himself, has portrayed during his
career, but at least he was awkwardly adorable
in doing so.

Blanchett just isn’t adorable. From the
get-go, she’s so perfectly over the top that it’s
ludicrous to look at herthe same way thatyou
would Ginger, for example, who has spent her
life working hard and tryingto ﬁnd happiness
with a suitable partner.]asmine’s character is
so well—written and so well—played that you
can’t really swallow what may seem like an
attempt to spoon-feed you prepackaged pity.

And that’s exactly the point.

You don’t feel bad for Jasmine’s inability
to live among the proletariat Instead ~— and
this is one of the most genius parts of the

‘ﬁlm — the audience feels bad with her. “Blue
jasmine” makes viewers understand the dif-
ference between empathy and sympathy, a
requisite for ﬁilly appreciating the ﬁlm. You
should empathize withjasmine because you
should know what it’s like to feel like you’re
above your conditions and that you’ve been
dragged through the dirt by rotten luck. But
you shouldn’t feel sympathy for her, because
while she’s on the ground, she’s aﬂat out crazy.

Seeing “Blue Jasmine” should produce
some sort of conversation about the very real
duality between pity and understanding, and
that’s a pretty Allen-esque concept.Jasmine’s
character is tragic, but she’s not atragic hero.

What becomes problematic, however, is
the movie’s accessibility. The dichotomy that
exists between whatyou should feel and what

you should not feel is pretty complicated, and
the lines are easily blurred. You want to pat
Jasmine on the back and encourage her one
moment, and then tell her to shut her cavalier
mouth the next. Her character demands a
humanistic conceptualizing that doesn’t just
plop her into two rigidly divided camps.

It is possible to like her. It is possible to
hate her. And it’s possible to fall right in the
middle. And there’s a good chance that the
last one is exactly what Allen was aiming for.

role of Romeo.

But the play’s cast is dodging kids and

‘dogs -for a reason. The complications created
by the play’s outdoor rehearsals are impor-
tant in helping the actors prepare them-
selves for their month of performances. Ac-
cording to Helen Meade, the play’s director
and a board member of Pittsburgh Shake-
speare in the Parks who brings experience
from both opera and theater direction, this

array of unique challenges during rehearsal
allows the actors to brace themselves with
working around an audience that controls

the dimensions of the stage through their >

choice in seating.

According to Meade, navigating the bal-
ance between stage and audience is key. She
says actors should be provided with speciﬁc

-V direction in order to remain grounded in

the scene, but “at the same time you have
to create staging that is incredibly ﬂexible,
because ultimately the audience decides
where they’re going to be for the show.”
This isn’t the only twist that outdoor
staging adds to the play. Michael Mykita,
an actor from Mars, Pa., who graduated
from Pitt in 1985 with a degree in computer
science, plays the role of Lord Capulet. He
says that the natural setting removes the
respite provided by a curtain.
‘ “Once you’re there, all eyes are on you,”
Mykita says, adding that even when off-
stage, “You’ve gotta kind of convince [the

audience] you are who you’re playing the I

whole time.”

Furthermore, the actors’ intonations
and vocal volumes must change to suit
the open environment, says Miller, who
received a year of classical acting training
at the London Academy of Music and Dra-
matic Art following his graduation from
Pitt-Johnstown.

He and co—star Danielle Powell, a se-
nior acting student at Point Park University
assuming the role of Juliet, must navigate
their moments of onstage intimacy while
ostensibly shouting their lines. “Even if it
doesn’t really feel natural to us  to be al-

most yelling at each other during all those ,

intimate and romantic scenes, we still have
to ﬁnd a balance,” Miller said.

But, according to Powell, raising the vol-
ume isn’t all bad. “I love being able to be as
loud as I want to be,” she says.

Even more crucially, the play’s ﬁght
scenes take on a newfound element of un-
predictability on the park’s hilly terrain.
Miller noted that during onstage combat,
he and his partner “have to be careful
about getting too much momentum going
downhill. Plus if it rained the day before, it’s

probably going to be a little bit slippery” -
meaning he must watch where he places his
feet, lest the faux violence get a little too real.

Still, even with all the pitfalls and haz- .

ards of an outdoor performance, the cast
expects their rendition of “Romeo and
Juliet” to be a big hit with crowds. The or-
ganic and adaptive use of the park makes
for performances that will vary based on

weather, locale and audience. As Meade puts 

it, this variation “keeps the performance
fresh in a way that you don’t see in other
productions.” I

Coming off a win against city
rival Duquesne, the Pitt wom-
en’s soccer team suffered a 2-0
loss against no. 23 Ohio State
in Columbus, Ohio, Wednesday
evening.

This game was one of three
that Pitt will play within the
next ﬁve days. Not only is this
a quick turnaround for the play-
ers, but this game was special
for another reason: It was a
homecoming for head coach
Greg Miller, who previously
coached the Buckeyes squad
for 11 seasons.

“Having recruited and
coached a lot of those kids, I
knew it would be a good contest
for us,” Miller said.

And a good contest it was.
Knowing the Buckeyes’ skill
level, the Panthers were not
surprised by the challenging
team they faced during the
game.

Ohio State’s tenacious of-
fense came out strong, im-
mediately challenging the Pitt
defense. The Buckeyes domi-
nated the first half, totaling
nine corners and eight shots.
However, Pitt junior goalie Ni-
cole D’Agostino remained cool
under pressure, only allowing
one shot to slip by and record-
ing two saves in the first half.

D’Agostino made a total of
three saves in the match.

Ohio State ﬁrst took the lead
in the 35th minute of play when

23 Ohio State

Alexis Degler headed the ball
into the net for a -1-0 lead that
extended into the second half.

Pitt freshman forward Ella
Vanhanen tried to tie the game
in the 53rd minute with a shot
on goal, but saw no success.

The Ohio State defense
stayed tight and strong, only
allowing Pitt one shot on goal
throughout the whole game.

In the second half, Ohio
State extended its lead with a
goal by senior midﬁelder Dan-
ica Wu, topping Pitt 2-0 in the
59th minute. This goal would
seal the win for OSU.

The Panthers did not want to
give up without a ﬁght, howev-
er. Pitt channeled its remaining
energy to attempt a comeback,
as three different players man-
aged to take shots. Unfortu-
nately, all three fell short.

Ohio State did not make a
comeback easily attainable for
the Panthers. The Buckeyes
played a rough game, tallying
a total of 12 fouls twice the num-
ber of fouls committed by Pitt.

With this game behind them,
there is only one thing the Pan-
thers can do: prepare for the
next opponent.

“Our first home game is
against Bucknell on Friday,
another quick turnaround.
We’re just going to get ready
for them,” Miller said.

Pitt’s record is now 1-1 and
they open their home sched-
ule against Bucknell this Friday
at Ambrose Urbanic Field at 5
p.m. I

The Pitt men’s soccer team is scheduled to
kick off its 2013 regular season with a home
contest against last season’s Horizon League
Champions, the Oakland Grizzlies, Friday at
Ambrose Urbanic Field.

Last season, Oakland compiled a regular-
season record of 11-7-1 and ﬁnished with a‘
conference record of 5-1-1. Oakland comes
into the season having lostboth the Horizon
League’s Offensive and Defensive Players of
the Year to graduation. ' I

Despite the losses, the Grizzlies ﬁnished in
a tie for secondplace in the preseason Hori-
zon League poll, trailing only Milwaukee, and
boast a very talented squad led by First-Team
All-Horizon Leaguers in midﬁelder Miche’le
Lipari and goalie Scott Messer.

In the match, the Grizzlies outshot the
Wildcats 5-4 while Central Michigan trans-
fer Sean Lewis and Eliott Tamey held the
Wildcats off the board, allowing the game-
to end in a 0-0 tie.

In the other two exhibition games against
Rio Grande and Saginaw Valley State, Oak-
land dominated. The Grizzlies outshot their
opponents by a combined 19 shots (31-12),
had four different players tally a goal and
played three different goaltenders.

_ Detroit squad.

In the preseason, the Panthers played
every single active member of their squad,
hoping to prepare some of the newcomers
for Friday night’s opener and beyond.

Projected starting net—minder Dan Lynd
had a very impressive exhibition season. The
sophomore from Penﬁeld, N.Y., helped the
Panthers to a tidy 2-0-1 record.

Offensively, senior Chris Davis andjunior
Chu Chu Onyeukwu paced the Panthers dur-
ing the exhibition season. Davis, a transfer
from Gardner—Webb, scored three times
while Onyeukwu scored key goals for the
Panthers in the ﬁnal two exhibition games.

The defense, led by senior captain John
Cordier, posted solid performances against
both McMaster and CalU, but the real story

' for the Panthers came from the midﬁeld.

After missing most of last season with
foot injuries, juniors Dan Prete and Ryan
McKenzie were both extremely impressive in
the preseason. Prete scored a goal in Sunday’s

 

win over McMaster, and McKenzie assisted
on the Panthers’ ﬁrst goal of Sunday’s win.

Key Matchup _

Oakland SR Midﬁelder Miche’le Lipari
against the Panthers’ back line.

Last season, the Panthers struggled with
turnovers and consistency within the back
line. And although the Panthers have worked
hard on tightening up and improving their
ball control, this was an area of weakness in
Saturday’s 2-2 draw against Detroit.

If the Panthers are sloppy with the ball,
look for the Grizzlies’ main weapon, Lipari, to
take advantage early and often. Last season,
Lipari tallied seven goals and three assists.

The Panthers defense must be on the
lookout for the shifty Lipari at all times.

Prediction: Pitt 3, Oakland 1

The Panthers will pick up their ﬁrst
victory of the season Friday night against
Oakland. Look for big games from senior
transfer Davis and last season’s lead goal
scorer, Nico Wrobel. M

The back line will be up for the challenge
and not turn the ball over, allowing the pair
of forwards to get into space and pressure
Oakland. I

Cross Country at Duquesne Duals

The men’s and women’s cross country
teams won’t have to travel far to start off
their 2013 schedule: The teams partici-
pate in the Duquesne Duals this week-
end. Even though the event is hosted by
Duquesne University, the course runs
through Schenley Park.

Senior Ben Kisley looks to shed some
time off last year’s 26:43 ninth—place
finish at the Duquesne Duals along with
junior Rich Addison, who ﬁnished 13th
with a timeof 27:16. Kisley and Addison

"look to become the veteran leaders for

a team that includes seven new faces.

The women’s team also has many un-
derclassmen on their roster, as well, but
the younger team members look to be
strong contenders. Cayla Del Piano looks
to expand on her freshman campaign in
her second season by ﬁnishing in the top
10 again this year at the Duals.

Sophomores Kathryn Born and Hill-
ary Boxheimer along with junior Morgan
Perry have hopes to join Del Piano in the
top 10 at this year’s event. ﬂ
