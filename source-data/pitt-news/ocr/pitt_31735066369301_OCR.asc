For Schenley

Renovaﬁons

B_y ROBIN LUBIC

Terry Milani, associate -director
of the Office of Student Activities
said that the mode of funding for
the proposed Student Union
renovation project is still un-
decided. '

‘Milani added that funding could
come from one of four sources: The
state General Services Administra-
tion, the university physical plant
funds, the university capital
campaign funds (donations) or the
Student Union fee.

Milani said that chances of
receiving funds from the state
General Services Administration
are very poor, as are the chances of
receiving money from either the
university physical plant funds, or
the capital campaign funds.

Although most people think of
Oakland and "the University of
Pittsburgh as one in the same

was not always the case. Not long

thousands of people to its theatres

University-related charges are

just one format: students

PiH's Spectrum of Political Organizations

By FRANK PHILLIPS

At Pitt there are a number of
groups reflecting all facets of the
political spectrum, from conserva-
tive ideals to left-wing ideologies.

Ted Nelson, president of the
College Young Democrats, said -the
major thrust of the organization is
to educate the student body and to
register voters. The Democrats,
with 60 members, work with the
College Republicans each year in
the voter registration drive.

‘_‘We were very pleased that we .

registered 600 voters this year,”
said Kim Borden, president of the
College Republicans. “That is the
highest figure in the last four or
five years.”

The College Republicans, a

50-member organization. has the
same goals on campus as the
Young Democrats.

“Apathy is a problem," Borden
said, “with students, studies come
first.”

“General apathy is what killed
us,” said a spokesman for the
Young Americans for Freedom.
The YAF was disbanded two weeks
ago. Their goal was to promote
conservatism,‘ freewill, and econ-
omic freedom. The problem was
two‘-fold, explained the spokesman.
No one was willing to pay the three
dollar membership fee, and since
the Panama Canal and Bakke
issues are over, the group felt there
were no issues. .

A lack of issues is not a problem
for the Young Socialist Alliance.

“We cannot stop working until
capitalist regimes do not exist
anywhere,” said member Mike
Kolak. “There has been a rise in
activism lately. Alt is a myth that
students are only concerned with
getting jobs.”

Kolak said the YSA exists to
educate the student and to provide
a vehicle to put new ideas into
practice. The YSA holds bi-weekly
classes, sells literature, and parti-

cipates .actively,on current- issues.

They are-involved in the push for
the Equal Rights Amendment, and
the anti-nuclear and divestment
movements.

“The Anti Imperialist Student
Union exists to promote third-world
1iberation,” said that group’s
president, Robert Wagner. The

AISU has held forums on liberation
movements in African nations and
Iran, and even held one on the
miners’ strike last year.

Wagner said the group also
exists as a spokesman for many of
the groups that cannot get
recognition at Pitt.

The Anti-Imperialist Student
Union allied with the YSA, the
Iranian Students Association, the

Black Action Society, and a number
of other groups to form the Pitt Out
of South Africa Coalition. The
coalition is an unrecognized group
that believes Pitt should divest
itself from companies involved in
South Africa. They have formed
picket lines, handed out leaﬂets
and collected petitions. A
spokesman said that their main
emphasis now is on educating the
public.

Wednesday. February 21. I979——Page 4Q

  Kimbo and
Sch enley Hall

Conney M. Kimbo, Pitt’s new vice chancellor for
student affairs, officially assumed his duties yester-
day. The former dean of student affairs at the
University of Missouri brings‘ very respectable
credentials to this university. Prior to holding the of-

fice of dean at St. Louis, Kimbo served as chief
student personnel administrator at that school and
earlier was dean of student affairs at Grinnell College
in Iowa.

“His experience has been on an urban campus,”
Chancellor Posvar said in announcing the appoint-
ment last December. “And he had previously per-
formed the same duties at a private institution which
makes him unusually well prepared for a university
like Pittsburgh, with its state-related, urban orien-
tation.” 

We sincerely hope Kimbo can meet Posvar’s expec-
tations, for he will find, if he already hasn’t, a great
number of areas that need improving at this univer-
sity.

There is the Pitt Union Program Council and the
changes it is undergoing, and new security measures
in the dorm area. Finally, there’s a topic of con-
siderable discussion these days—student union
renovations—and why nothing has been done so far.

At Friday’s Student Government Board meeting,
Terrence Milani, associate director of student ac-
tivities, said that plans for rennovations were
progressing. He indicatedithatrit would be Kimbo
who would make the decisions as to what extent the
rennovations would be made, and which funding
would be most feasible.

The pressure is on Kimbo, as Posvar’s newest ad-
visor, to create a first-rate institution for Pitt
students. ‘

Constant lobbying by student leaders is surely
helpful, and a Student Affairs Advisory Committee
meeting in the outdated recreation room has sym-

bolic value. But in the end, it must be assumed that

, Kimbo will be the man Posvar will be likely to listen

to.

At Friday’s SGB meeting, board member Dave
Hesidence stated that a rennovated Student Union is
“vital for the university's survival. Students get
frustrated because there is no center for commuters
on campus.” .

Kimbo should talk to these commuters. They
aren’t hard to find. They can usually be found
fighting the noise in the recreation room. He should
meet with student organizations which occupy the
cramped offices of Schenley Hall to discover where‘,
the repairs are most needed. Better still, he should
tour the building from the first floor to the top. He
probably won’t like what he sees.

Don ’t Complain to Harrisburg About Teachers in Pittsburgh

The letter by Assistant Professor
Peter Lipow in the Feb. 12 issue of
The Pitt News contains several
thoughtful and provocative state-
ments that deserve consideration.
But it contains one very dangerous
statement that needs _to be
addressed immediately: I‘ Lipow
suggests that students send their
complaints against poor teachers at
Pitt to the state legislature.

Nothing could be at the same
time more pointless and more
damaging to teaching at‘ Pitt. A
investigate a
charge_of poor ‘teaching in the
university. He cannot judge the
accuracy of the charge. Even if it is
accurate, he cannot remedy the
situation,

‘  All he can do is vote against an

appropriation for the entire univer-
Sit)?» thﬁfeh)’ Punishing more than
2,000 faculty members, 3,500
staff employees and 22,000 stu-

dents with\ smaller salary raises,

higher tuition and, ultimately, a
poorer quality faculty. Complaints
to the legislature, therefore, are
not only «useless; they are suicidal.

Where, then, can a frustrated
student turn when he feels he has
been the victim of poor teaching?
Oddly, Lipow’s letter also contains
the right answer. Write a letter to
the chairman of the department in
which the faculty member teaches.
(For non-CAS courses such as
engineering, nursing, education
and so on, write to the dean.)

It is the chairman (or the dean of
the smaller schools) who has the
responsibility for who teaches what
in the department. It is the
chairman ‘who makes all the
recommendations for faculty salary
increases, promotion and tenure.

The deans and the provost are
looking harder these days at faculty
members’ teaching records before
approving promotions. Many
chairmen are therefore hungry for
evidence on their faculties’ teach-
ing abilities. / Students’ letters
documented and signed, of course
can supply some of the raw. data the
chairmen need for making their
judgments.

A file full of letters’ from
disgruntled students cannot be

students‘ concerned with
education and its quality.

ignored by a chairman who is
recommending the promotion of a
faculty .member. (Of course,
students will want to write these
letters only after the term’s grades
are in.) »

But, let’s keep it fair. Whenever
a student feels that he or she has
observed outstanding teaching

quality in ‘a faculty member, the
student should also drop a note to
the chairman. That’s both a duty
/and a service to all students.
There’s no better way for students
to help reward good teaching and
to help the better teachers be
retained on the faculty than to let
the chairmen know who’s doing a"
good job.

Chairmen’s names and addres-
ses can be found in the front of the
faculty and staff telephone direct-
ory by looking up the name of the 1
department.

Pitt’s ‘Collective Educational Experience’

Peter Lipow’s recent letter in the
Feb. 12 edition of The Pitt News
concerning the university adminis-
tration’s stress‘ on building a
first-class research faculty with
less-than-equal concern for the
teaching competence of the faculty,
certainly begs a response from all
their

Our collective educational exper-
ience at the University of Pitts-
burgh has in the past often
prompted us to privately discuss
our suspicions that frequently the
concerns of faculty members were

centered in areas other than that of
high quality undergraduate student
education.

In light of certain facts brought
forth by Lipow, our suspicions
seem to be conﬁrmed. In fact, if
Lipow is correct, the responsibility
for the astonishing number of
negative educational experiences
we have encountered as under-
graduate students at Pitt is not
-restricted to the incompetent
instructors as individuals, but
rather to a university administra-
tive policy which apparently
willingly “.. .condones quite a bit of
teaching incompetence...’ ’ The
very possibility that the obvious

’ lack of teaching skills exhibited by

a sizable portion of the faculty may
actually be related to a university
policy is nothing less than
shocking.

As students who finance our own
education, we must now ask some
serious questions regarding the
value of the teaching services
rendered by the university. We
understand the importance of

research to the university with

. respect to prestige and the possible

income derived from research

activity’, however; do the adminis- .

trators of the university realize the
importance and prestige of a high
quality education to the student?

Do they understand that quality
education is ostensibly the service
we pay the university to provide
both as residents of Pennsylvania
(and taxpayers) and as students?
Can any student afford to pay a
university that seemingly ‘is willing
to ignore the basic importance of
the relationship between a student
and a good educator?

We appreciate Lipow’s courage
and candor in calling the problem
of research versus education to the
university undergraduate com-
munity’s attention. We hope that
other concerned persons associated
with the university, both faculty
and students, will make use of all
resources including the state
legislature in addressing this most
disconcerting university policy..

‘ Hardcore’ a Bore as Scott Evens Score

By BILL SELL
’ Pitt News Staffwriter
Hardcore
Directed by Paul Schrader
Colombia

Jake Van Horn is a simple,
god-fearing, Midwestern business-
man who lives a rather sedate life
alone with his teenage daughter.

' He is relatively happy and easy

going, until he is faced with the
reality of “Hardcpre’ ’.

George C. Scott plays the lead

role as a father frantically
searching for his runaway daugh-
ter, ‘Christy. who mysteriously
disappears during a field trip to Los
Angeles.

Not yet knowing the fate of his
daughter, Scott hires a private
detective (Peter Boyle), an obese
ill-mannered man who supposedly
is one of the best in the
business-——Boyle is unable to find
the girl but does come up with a
nice stag ﬁlm featuring Christy.

This really enrages Scott. Not
getting much help from Boyle, he

decides to head west and look for
her himself.

In the beginning of his search he
experiences nothing but dead ends.
Going to an assortment of adult
book stores and massage parlors
showing Christy's picture and
inquiring about her whereabouts,
Scott is continually refused help. It
seems that everybody “just works
here” and doesn‘t know anything.
This makes him angry, even violent
at times.

Through a strange set of
circumstances, Scott meets up with

Nikki (Seasbn Hubley) a teenage
prostitute who helps him in his
search for Christy. "

Through Nikki's connections in
the porno world, Scott finds out
that his daughter is involved with a
man by the name of Ratan, a
sado-masochist who gets his thrills
by cutting the throats of little girls
and filming it.

Again through the help of Nikki,
Scott traces Ratan to a night-club in
San Francisco. There is the. place
for the showdown and it's
anti-climatic.

Scott gives a credible perfor-
mance, but Hubley doesn't rise
above the caliber of acting in
made-for-television films on teen-
age prostitution.

“Hardcore" is a rrﬁivie filled
with exposed cleavage and little
girls ‘with foul mouths. That's
about all.

Although there are some inter-
esting scenes—Scott visiting a
brothel that accepts Master-
charge——the rest of the movie is
rather boring.

Theater

By MARK HOLAN
Pitt News Staff Writer

Alternative theater. What is
it—this unique idiom at Pittsburgh
Laboratory Theater, Theater Ex-
press and Pitt's 99 cent Floating
Theater?

According to Dr. Leon Katz,

professor of speech and theater ’

arts at Pitt and director of the 99
cent Floating Theater, alternative

, theater ‘is “an expression of the life

of it's time.”

As people and society change, so
does alternative theater. It is
continually reflecting and reinter-
preting our everyday lives.

Unlike‘ more conventional thea-
ter, such as commercial, regional
academic or community, alterna-
tive theater is not concerned with
building a cultural image Katz
said. A '

Alternative theater is nothing

if new. It is approximately‘100-year»s-

old. Yet alternative theater is
continually renewing itself and
never static.

There is a paradoxical quality to
alternative theater. On one level,

alternativetheater is in continual A

rebellion against the standards and
methods of conventional theater.

On another level, alternative
theater. is continually rebel-
ling -against itself also. It turns
against the standards it. has
created, dismissiong them as tired
and traditional. It is forever
seeking a new, untried form of
expression and creativity.

In Pittsburgh, alternative theater
has_been around since the 1920s.

One company, known as the Little .

Theater Movement, performed al-
ternative theater at the old Nixon
Theater. But alternative theater
was not readily accepted by the
public and remained obscure until
the 19605. ' H -

The radicalism and acceptance of
new ideas and change in the 19605
helped alternative theater ﬂourish
and} grow. Most of the work done
in this decade was very political.
This, of course, was not surprising,
considering that the audiences at
alternative theater productions
were mostly college students who
themselves were very politically
minded.

Alternative theater in the ’60’s
was often shocking. It was liberal

T and its use of violence and nudity;

it attacked and questioned accep-
ted standards and norms. As
audiences began to grow more
diverse, it became apparent to
many people that alternative
theater was certainly a departure
from the conventional stage.
True to its nature, alternative
theater today is not the same as it

A ' was in the "60's.

“The ’60s image is what many
people have of alternative theater
today," Katz said.

isAlive, Well and Growing in Oakland

‘s

Alternative theater in the 1970s
is “quieter, more professional,’ ’. he
said. It has developed a higher
degree of artistry and is more
aesthetic.

Two outstanding examples of
alternative theater in the ’70s in
Pittsburgh are Pittsburgh Labora-
tory Theater and Theater Express.
Katz said both are genuinely
committed to the goals of alterna-
tive theater.

Pittsburgh Laboratory Theater is
the oldest existin‘g alternative
theater company in the city. It is
approximately eight years old, and
the one company that performed
alternative theater before the city’s
recent theater renaissance, which,
according to Katz, is only about
ﬁve years old. ‘

Bill and Kate Royston, both
directors, were the founders of the
theater. They acknowledged that
at the outset it was difficult for
Pittsburghers to accept their
company and alternative theater in
general. But they knew that if their
audience grew, V so would their
company. if &

At first the audience was mostly
students. However, over the years
it has grown more diverse. This is
due in part to the city wide theater
renaissance.” ~

The directors both agreed that
today’s audience is very intelligent
and discriminating. People who
attend plays at the lab theater have
become part of what’s happening,
like part of the family. They may
not always like what is_ going on but
rather than abandoning the com-
pany, they show interest. _

“People know the actors and

others associated with the theater. ’

They write letters and voice
opinions at gatherings after per-
formances. The theater has
evolved the way the audience has

wanted it to evolve,” said Bill ‘

Royston.

One of the more recent alterna-
tive theater companies to blossom
in the city is the Theater Express.
The company was originally a
touringtroupe but has now settled
down for its first season in the old
Plaza Rubber Building on ‘Baum
Boulevard.

Caren Harder, founder and
general manager of Theater Ex-
press, cited two reasons for settling

[in Pittsburgh.

touring, we needed a home,

“You can’t be as creative while
" she
said.

Although other East Coast cities
were considered, Harder said she
felt. there was a “heightened
awareness" of alternative theater
in Pittsburgh withgood potential
for both ﬁnancial and audience
support. ‘

She reported thatiaudienccs have
been growing steadily, and that

L people are more op_en than ever to

the unexpected or atypical. She
said that Theater. Express would

like to try a range of new things,

including sound, image and move-
ment. .“It’s an exciting time to be
creating new theater,” she said.
She said that Theater Express
would like to try a range of new

things, including sound, image and
movement. ‘‘It’s an exciting time
to be creating new theater,” she
said.

That doesn’t always work, as Bill
and Kate Royston also admitted,
but it is worth the effort

nevertheless and it‘ is _part of
alternative theater. .

“Good theater begets good
theater,” said Kate Royston.
There’s certainly a substantial
offering of it in the city today and-
there probably will be even more
tomorrow.

Sha Na Na is Here to Stay

unabashed rock n roll in its
crudest form, as reproduced in this
case by the crudest of bobby-sox
rock ’n‘ rollers—Sha Na Na-_—
during five sold-out performances

at the Stanley Theatre last

‘ weekend. . .
The durable popularity of rock

‘n’ roll in general and of Sha Na Na
in particular, however unbeliev-
able; is unquestionable. “Rock '31’
Roll Is Here To Stay" sings the
10-man group just prjor to

predictable encores, and, in the

A name of Buddy Holly, who can

argue?

A show with Sha Na Na is pure
entertainment. From the opening
“sha na na’s”. of ‘.‘Get A Job’.’ to
the departing lyrics of “Goodnight,
Sweetheart," the group excites an
audience. .

The songs need no introduction

and are given none. The opening
chords of such classics as “Blue
Moon.” “‘l6 Candles", and
“Smoke Gets in Your Eyes"
introduction enough.

Each of the bands 10 members

has a unique appeal (and each
takes a turn with lead vocal). but
none quite matches the personality

of Bowser. One can only enjoy the
vocals and antics of this horse-
faced bass singer.

For a group that relies on—and
prospers from-—other artists’
oldies, Sha Na Na attracts quite a
following. Witness the cr wd,
comprised not only of near-crazed
adolescents, but their near-crazed
parents and grandparents as well.
And, oh yes, those ‘dubbed-in
screams and applause that are
conveniently spliced into the
group’s television show—they're
real in concert.

By all indications. then. Sha Na
Na is here to stay»-that is, at least
until our appetite for nostalgia and
good, fun music remains.

the evening, which was broadcast
over WPGH.

“I think it was very successful,

hurt us,” Whaley said.

“Quit while you’re ahead” was

the reason Whaley gave for

Ciney No Cindi, Unbeaten Swimmers Prevail, 58-55

By KAREN KADILAK
Pitt News Staff Writer

For the second straight year,
Pitt’s swim team (10-0) ﬁnished its
dual meet season undefeated, but
it wasn’t easy.

Trailing by four points, the
Panthers needed a victory in the
400-yard freestyle relay (the ﬁnal
event) to defeat Cincinnati’s
Bearcats, 58-55, Saturday in
Cincinnati.

It was the closest and probably
the toughest meet of the season for

Pitt, one of the few undefeated
teams in the nation.

The Panthers initially led, but a
victory in the three-meter'diving,
the next’ to last event, allowed
Cincinnati to go ahead, 55-51, and
set the stage for the decisive
400-yard freestyle relay.

“It shouldn’t have been that
close,” Pitt coach Fred Lewis said.
“We could have done better, but
we were off. We suffered from a
lack of concentration.

“We were a little slow and
complacent because we were tired.

I was happy to get out of there
(Cincinnati) with a win.”

Mickey Termin, one of the four
double winners for Pitt (Mark
Schuman, Stu Swanson and Rick
Carter were the others) led the
Panthers. According to Lewis,
Termin’s “fantastic split” in the
anchor leg of the 400-yard freestyle
relay enabled Pitt to take a sizeable
lead and win the event.

“Mickey was three body lengths
ahead of everyone else,” Lewis
said. “With a lead like that, there

was no way Cincinnati was going to
catch us. Because of Mickey, we
led the rest of the way.”

Along with Termin, swimming
on the 400-yard freestyle relay
were Tom McGinley, Bob Green-
wald, and Rick Carter.

Pitt also won the 400-yard
medley relay, prompting Lewis to
comment that a combination of the
relays and team depth helped Pitt
win its 21st straight dual meet.

SWIM NOTES: Pitt will defend
its team title in the Eastern

regional championship next week-
end at Penn State. Lewis said
Cincinnati speciﬁcally concentrated
on stopping Pitt’s All-America
candidate Jeff Trew, who ﬁnished
second in the 500-yard freestyle
and third in the 1,650-yard
freestyle. “They felt they had to
beat Jeff so they could stay even
with us and beat us in diving,”
Lewis said. “They even rested
their distance swimmers last week
so they would be ready for Jeff.”
Pitt ﬁnished first in six of the 13
events. '

Sam Clancy led Pitt with 20 points last night, but the Panthers fell to league

champion Villanova, 75-73.

Wildcats trike, Cagers Lose 75-73  

  Scoreless Minutes Cost Pitt Game

By MARIA SCIULLO
Pitt News Sports Editor V.

The team that lived by its free
throws in its last nine games died
by them last night.

The Pitt basketball Panthers,
shooting for the chance to win the
Eastern Eight title outright and
meet league cellar-dweller Mass-
achusetts in the first round of
tournament playoffs, fell to Villa-
nova on the Wildcats’ noisy Field
House court, 75-73.

Pitt, a four-point underdog,

I totally controlled the game-for 38

minutes. The»Panthers shot 53
percent in the first half to edge
Villanova at halftime, 34-31. From
then on, matters looked as if they
couldn’t get much better. Until the
ﬁnal two minutes, however, when
they couldn’t have gotten much
worse. ,
Midway through the second half,
after Pitt had missed three
consecutive layup attempts, Pan-
ther center Sam Clancy and
Wildcat guard Tom Sienkiewicz put
on a two-man show with Clancy
ﬁrst scoring from underneath the
basket, then the 6-2 Villanova point
guard popping in 12-14-foot jump
shots during a period in which
Clancy scored 11 of Pitt’s 13 points.
Both led their teams in scoring:
Clancy with 20 points and

Sienkiewicz with 26. \

With barely three minutes left in
the game and the Panthers hanging
on to a hard-eamed 72-62 lead after
a pair of Carlton Neverson
free-throws, Pitt worked its way
around the Villanova press to wear
the clock down to 1:50. Neverson

was fouled and converted one of his

(shots to bring the score to 73-64.

It was to be the last time the
ofﬁcial scorekeeper had to bother
with the running score on Pitt’s
side of the book.

Villanova stormed back with the
help of Sienkiewicz and 6-6 center
Alex Bradley to close within one
point, 73-72.
fouled by Wildcat guard Tom
Bethea but was unable to put the
game out of reach when Bradley
snagged his missed free throw.

Sienkiewicz’ jumper with 12
seconds left was the climax of the
two-minute comeback.

Pitt’s hope for regaining the
lead (and it was only the second
time the "visitors trailed) were
dashed when forward Sammie Ellis
was called for palming the ball as
the Panthers’ attempted to bring
the basketball up the full length of
the court. _

A last-second half-court shot by
Clancy was errant and the Panthers
lost their ﬁrst game after winning
nine in a row. Villanova (13-12)
wins the regular season Eastern

Clancy was then‘ ‘

Eight title while the Panthers (16-9)
must still contend with third-place
Rutgers this Friday at the Pitt Field
House. A Pitt win would assure
coach Tim Grgurich’s team of
meeting slow but safe Penn State in
the opening round of the tourna-
ment; a loss would probably mean
facing potentially-dangerous West
Virginia.

“I have nothing to criticize about
our play,” said Grgurich, “except
our free throw shooting. We
missed four opportunities to win
the game at the line.

“Sure, its a tough loss, but
we’ve been playing too well to let it
ruin things. I know our players will
bounce back because they've had a
positive attitude all along.”

PITT NOTES: Pitt’s league
record falls to 6-3...Last Saturday's
60-54 win over Duquesne was the
ﬁrst time ever that Pitt beat its.
crosstown rivals twice in one
season and within a few weeks may
haverto make it three...Again, only
two players were substituted for
Pitt last night: guards Pete
Strickland and Dave Olinger....

Wrestlers Decisioned By Nittany lions, 25-1 6

By JIM LEWIS
Pitt News Staff Writer
Penn State won seven of ten
bouts to defeat the Pitt wrestling
team, 25-16, Saturday at the Field
House.

“Penn State wrestled like they
wanted to win,” Panthers’ head
coach Dave Adams said. “And we
didn't look like we wanted to
wrestle. We let Penn State control
the match and wrestle its style."

The Lions’ lineup had been
hampered by injuries to 142-
pounder George Medina’ and
118-pounder Ray Frantz but Penn
State (2-11) was able to take wins
from 126 pounds to 158 pounds to
beat Pitt (5-9).

Panther 118-pounder Glenn
Maxwell pinned Jack Chidester at

7:05 to put Pitt in front, 6-0 but the
next Panther individual victory
wasn’t until 167, where Skip Bolin
super-decisioned Andy Bingaman,
12-4. By then, the Lions had a 19-10
lead.

Heavyweight Steve Smocharski
was the only other winner for Pitt,
pinning PSU’s Jim Sleeper at 3:15.
By then, the Panthers had clinched
their fourth loss in a row.

“We have to ﬁnd enthusiasm
and aggressiveness,” Adams said.
“Maxwell and Smocharski were
the only two guys that were
aggressive out there.”

Pitt’s only lead was a brief 6-0
advantage after Maxwell's pin, but
it was all Penn State after that. Bob
Bury ,126 pounds, decisioned Pitt’s
Jose_ Martinez, 7-3. Jim Earl, 134

pounds, pinned Glen Nacion at
7:00.

‘Geoff Brodhead, 142 pounds,
decisioned Bill Clark, 6-3. Don
Conrman, 150 pounds, super-
decisioned Mario Mancini, 10-2.
John Hanrahan, 158 pounds,
decisioned Tom Jones, 2-1. Dan

Pfautz, 177-pounds, decisioned Jim
Gordon, 12-7 and 190-pounder Sam
Sallitt decisioned Pat Connor, 11-4.

‘‘I think both teams wrestled
hard,” Lion head coach Rick
Lorenzo said. “lt’s just that today
we were more fortunate than Pitt

“If we wrestle Saturday like we
did today,” Adams said, “we’ll be
lucky not to ﬁnish in last place.”

MAT NOTES: The loss dropped
Pitt into sixth place in the EWL
with a 1-4 record...Penn State is 2-3
in the EWL...West Virginia is 0-1
in the EWL...134-pounder Jeff
Gordon, 142-pounder Steve Goule-
tas and 150-pounder Ed Bredniak
are improbable for the West
Virginia match and are question-
able for the EWL Tournament. Of
the three, Bredniak has the best
chance of returning to the_ lineup.

Spectacular individual perform-
ances by Panthers Bob Besong,
Allan Meyers and Doug Smith and
Pantherettes Holly Martino and
Bonnie Tressler contributed to
weekend wins for both the men’s
and women’s gymnastics teams.

The men set a new Pitt scoring
1‘£CQ1'd;'.in upsetting 20th-ranked
Navy, 1.98.60 - 196.85, while the
women defeated William & Mary,
128.75 - 118.40.

-“What an incredible meet,” said
men’s coach Frank D’Amico.
“Everybody did their best job in
every event.”

Besong. won the all-around,
scoring 48.95 and Doug Smith was
second with a score of 45.7-his
highest ever.

In the ﬂoor exercise, rings and
vault, Pitt took first and second
places. Meyers took first in the
ﬂoor with an 8.9 while Besong
placed second with an 8.6.

In the rings, Besong took first
(8.85).while Meyers placed second
with an 8.75.

“We really picked up a lot of
momentum after rings,” said
D’Amico. “Not only did Bob
(Besong) and Al (Meyers) place
one-two, but freshman‘ Carlos
Smith got his best rings score ever,
an 8.65, which, placed him third.”

In the vault, Meyers placed first
with a 9.0 while Besong was
runnerup with an 8.85.

Meyers turned in another strong
performance in the parallel bars,
scoring 8.7 while teammate Cem
Akisoglu placed third with an 8.15.

According to D’Amico. the side
horse team—with Mitch Spero’s
8.4-—tumed the meet around. .

“The 30 points that we scored: in
the sidehorse was our best ever and
was one of the -turning points of the
meet,” D’Amico said.

However, the final event——the
high bar—was the deciding event.

Doug Smith won that event,
scoring an 8.9 and Meyers placed
second with an 8.8

“Doug simply captured the
audience and Al did a routine that
he hasn’t been doing because of a

wrist injury,” said D’Amico. “I'd I

say that those two scores clinched
the meet.”

The Pantherettes had a few
meet-clinching scores of their own
in defeating the inexperienced
William & Mary Indians.

Martino scored the women’s first
9.0 of the season in, the vault,
giving her first place in that event.
Tressler ’placed second with an
8.45, while William & Mary
standout Jan Roltsch was third with
an 8.2.

Martino also won the uneven

Men Gymnasts Upset Ranked Navy;
Women Defeat Young William &\Mary

bars (8.25) and floor exercise (8.5)
and placed second in the balance
beam (8.1).

Roxanne Evans was second in
the unevens, tied with teammate
Myra Bachuchin at 8.15, while
Tressler was fourth with an 8.1.

‘‘It was just one of those days on
the bars,” said coach Donna

DeMarino Sanft. “There were a lot

of breaks byboth .»teams.

‘‘I was actually not very pleased
with the scoring all day.

It started out low and continued
that way throughout the meet.”

In the ﬂoor exercise, Tressler,

placed second with an 8.4 while the

0 Indians’ Roltsch was third with an

8.15.

Tressler excelled in the balance
beam with an 8.8 score, taking first
place. Behind second place Mar-
tino was Roltsch again with 7.85.

In the all-around, Martino edged
Tressler for top honors, 33.85
-33.75, while Roltsch was third with
32 points.

According to Sanft, while Pan-
therette Dawn Reimer had a rough
day due to a shoulder injury,
teammate Diane Debich had her
season highs _in -both the vault
(7.95) and floor exercise (7.25).

Sanft said the low scores that Pitt
received Saturday will be “devas-
tating to us in our quest to qualify
for nationals.”

Women Trackers Set Records at Princeton Relays

Easterns,’ said sprinter Lisa
Haupt. “We’re excited about
Eastern’s being at Princeton
because they have good facilities
and a good track.”

Individual relay teams competed
against each other and team
scoring was not kept.

0 ‘‘It’s too bad they didn’t have
team scoring because we did pretty
well,” said shot putter Carmen
Scherich. A

Marie Ribik and Peri Jude
Radecic set individual Princeton
Relays records in the high jump
and shot put. Ribik’s jump of  - 6
combined with teammate Pam

 

Gearing’s 5-6 jump was enough to
place Pitt well in front of any other
highjumping team and their
combined 11-2 height was also a
new Princeton record. Radecic and
Scherich ﬁnished second as a team
in the shot put competition.

Hurdler Leslie Palmer was
outleaned at the finish line and took
second in the 60-yard .individual
event. Also placing second were
the 880- and mile relay teams.

Haupt, Gwen Murray, Karen
Krichko and Linda Mitchell’s time
of 3:53.2 was fast enough for
second place despite the fact they
were in an “unseeded” heat. The
time is also a new Pitt indoor
record. Murray, Mitchell, Cissy

Wilborn and Palmer were part of
Pitt’s second-place 880-relay.
Wilborn placed fourth in the

individual long jump competition

and, along with Kim Green, won
second-place team honors.
Another Pitt indoor record was
set by the two-mile relay of Karen
Bradley, Maria Sciullo, Brenda
Chorpenning and Jane Strause.
Strause, running anchor leg, took
the baton in second place and
caught Georgetown’s runn'er to win
thePantherette’s heat in 9:43. Pitt
placed ﬁfth overall in the event.

Pitt returns to Princeton in three
weeks for the Eastern Association
of Intercollegiate Athletics for
Women (EAIAW) indoor cham-
pionships.

  Cold-Shooting  lvanlllerell sFinallyLockUp

By ANNA ARLOTTA

Pitt News Staff Writer
Few and far between describes

' the scoring in Pitt’s 55-48 win over

Lock Haven in women's basketball
action last Saturday. The contest
was a preliminary game played
before the near-capacity crowd that
eagerly awaited the Duquesne
men’s game to follow.

“In the ﬁrst half we were really

ﬂat,” said coach Jean Balthaser.
“This is absolutely the worst
shooting game we ever had.”

Balthaser’s statement could be
supported by ‘a look at the ﬁnal
statistics. Pitt shot 24% from the
floor (a 3% decrease from the
previous contest with Cheyney
State that ended in a 61-49
Pantherette loss.)

“Our concentration just was not
good out there," added Jean
Balthaser, “our offense became
very tentative. We got ourselves in
a slump, aided by a lack of
concentration.’ ’

The offense that was generated
by the Pantherette lineup came
from freshman substitute Tracy
Evans. Evans has been a good shot
for Pitt throughout the season and

emerged as the big factor in the
Pantherette shooting game. She
was high for Pitt with 16 points, the
only Pantherette in double figures.
Pitt was up by 22-17 in the game
until Lock Haven ran off eight
unanswered points. A basket by
freshman center Gail Aughbums
brought Pitt to within one point a
the half,” —
The Pantherettes pulled away

Victory, 55-48

early in the second half, building
up a 45-33 lead by outscoring Lock
Haven 17-0. With this 12-point lead
the Pantherette offense started to
slip away——at a rapid pace. That
lead was cut to ﬁve with one minute
remaining.

Defensively, the Pantherettes
were led by Aughburns with 13
rebounds followed by Carol Dugan
with 12.

lcers Bumed By Bowling Green in Candlelight Toumey

Pin News Staff Writer

The Pitt hockey team took
second place at the Sixth Annual
Candlelight Tournament at Lake
Vue Ice Arena last, weekend,
defeating Duquesne and losing to

Bowling Green. : . ~ '

The Panthers easily beat the
Dukes, 4-1, despite having to kill 14
minor penalties against them. Tom
Sherwin started the scoring for Pitt
on a power play goal, his sixth of
the year, at 10:22 of the ﬁrst
period.

Curt Hetz added his fourthégoal
of the season 3:45 minutes later on
a pass from Cliff Ziegler, while Bill
Gedeon notched his 11th at 4:28 of
the second period. Tom Duffy
tallied his seventh at 9:15 of the
third period to build a 4-0 lead and
coast to the championship game

against Bowling Green. _ ‘
Pitt(6-'9) had its problems in the
first two periods of the champion-
ship match, as Bowling Green
skated to a 6-1 lead. Panther Gary
Fries scored his first goal of the
season at 13:07 ”of the second
period to keep Pitt in the~contest.

The Panthers controlled the third,
period but could only score once,’
on Hetz’s ﬁfth goal at 7:56. It
wasn't enough to offset the
Falcons’ Don McLaughlin, the
tournament’s most valuable player
who scored a hat trick against the
Panthers.
