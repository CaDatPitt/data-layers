Lindsay Passodelis
For The Pitt News

Dressed in camouﬂage fatigues and combat
boots, Joe Iacono marched to honor the
memory of U.S. service men and women
who have been captured by the enemy or
whose fates have remained unknown.

“We have to keep awareness that we
still have people missing,” Iacono said.
“Once you forget, you forget, and that can’t
happen.”

Iacono, a Vietnam War veteran, was one
of about 20 veterans and family members
who attended the closing ceremony of the
31st Vietnam veterans Annual POW-MIA
Vigil 2 p.m. Sunday at the Soldiers 8: Sailors
Memorial Hall and Museum. The museum,
sponsored this year’s event, which began
at noon Saturday.

The vigil began with a show of patrio-
tism and remembrance for prisoners of
war and those officially listed as missing in
action. Members of the public took turns
bearing the American ﬂag for 15-minute
intervals, according to a statement from
Soldiers 8: Sailors Museum. I

Panther Lair pounces on ESPN source

Harrison Kaminsky and
Gideon Bradshaw
The Pitt News Staﬁ”

The Panther Lair showed its teeth Thurs— 1

day after fans on the Pitt sports news site
began to question whether a man de-

scribed in an ESPN.com article as a for-
mer Pitt football player had ever actually
played for the team.

The ESPN.com article quoted aformer
Pitt player, Joe Cosgrove, in an article pub-
lished on its site Wednesday. But some us-
ers soon noticed that there were no official

Wecirxesclay, lSept:eml.;er 25

recordsthat Cosgrove ever played for the

Panthers in a regular-season game.
Since Panther Lair users began to chal-

1enge.Cosgrove’s claims, his Facebook and

Twitter accounts have been deactivated

and his Linkedln proﬁle has been made
private. . ‘

In addition to these changes, a claim
that Cosgrove won two varsity letters
while playing Panther football has been
removed from-his Linkedln proﬁle. The
same claim has been removed from the
biography posted on the website for his

company, Pentec Health, which is based
in Boothwyn, Pa.

In ESPN’s original article, which was
published Wednesday, Cosgrove said he
stands by former Pitt head football coach
Todd Graham. —

When Pitt fans ﬁrst noticed the article,
they began to express anger at Cosgrove
for supporting former Pitt head coach Gra-

ham, who abruptly left Pitt in December
2011 to become Arizona State University’s

head football coach.

When Graham prepared to leave for
ASU, he had then-Pitt director of foot-
ball operations Blair Philbrick forward
the message to members of the football
team, informing them of his decision. This
choice not to tell his players directly has
generated widespread criticism among
college football fans, players and oflicials.

Philbrick was the director of football
operations at the University of Tulsa when

1 Graham was the head football coach there

in 2010. He ﬁlled the same capacity at Pitt
under Graham in 2011. According to his
Linkedln proﬁle, Philbrick is now cor-
porate executive coach at Pentec Health,
where Cosgrove holds the title of president
and CEO. _

When the ESPN.com article was ﬁrst
published, Pitt fans on Panther Lair, which
allows users to comment in discussion
threads, were angry over Cosgrove’s sup-
port for Graham. ‘

But their anger turned to rage as they

September 28, 2018 lThe Pitt News | vvvvvv.pittnevve.e0m

began to focus on his claim that he had
played football for Pitt. Commenters noted
that they could not ﬁnd evidence of any
former Pitt player with Cosgrove’s name.
“This led to a lot of people investigat-
ing and questioning the legitimacy of his
position as a former Pitt football player,”
Panther Lair editor Chris Peak said.
Mike Humes, a spokesman for ESPN,

said that the author of the article was in-
troduced to Cosgrove ‘on the sideline of
an ASU home game against Wisconsin.

According to Humes, Penni Graham, '

Todd Graham’s wife, and Tim Cassidy,
ASU’s director of football operations, in-
troduced the writer to Cosgrove.

ASU employees contacted by phone
Thursday would not answer questions
about Cosgrove. ASU Senior Associate

Athletic Director Rocky Harris has not

responded to an email asking for comment
on the relationship between Cosgrove and
the university.

Humes also said that the network ini-
tially checked Cosgrove’s claim that he
played football at Pitt by looking at Cos-
grove’s biography, posted on the website
for his company,“Pentec Health. In the

biography, Cosgrove was described as a
two-time Pitt football letter winner.

According to Humes, ESPN spoke with
E.]. Borghetti, Pitt’s senior associate direc-
tor of athletics, late Thursday afternoon.
During this exchange, Borghetti told the
network that there were no records to
indicate that Cosgrove ever played in any
regular-season games for Pitt football.

After ESPN spoke with Borghetti, ESPN
edited the article to reflect that Cosgrove
had only played in a 1986 spring game,
Humes said.

“It was an unfortunate oversight, and
we updated the story as soon as we re-
ceived the accurate information,” Humes
said in a statement he emailed to The Pitt
News. _

Borghetti separately told The Pitt News

that there are no records indicating Cos— -
grove ever received a varsity letter from

Pitt. ,

The only ofﬁcial record that shows Cos—
grove’s involvement with the Pitt football
team was a spring roster from 1986, he
said. But for the fall season that same year,
there is no mention of Cosgrove on any
roster. - '

Pitt spokesman John Fedele also said

the spring roster was the only record that

mentions Cosgrove as part of the football
team. .

“Thus, any time he spent with the Pitt
football program as a student—athlete
would’ve been brief,” Fedele said in an
email.

Fedele said records do indicate that
Cosgrove was enrolled at Pitt from Sep-
tember 1985 to December 1986.

Cosgrove graduated from Rowan Uni-
versity in 2000, according tojose Cardo-
na, a spokesman for the university, which
is located in Glassboro, N.].

Borghetti did not answer further inqui-
ries Thursday and Friday on the relation-
ship between Cosgrove and Pitt’s athletic
department.

But meanwhile, Cosgrove’s comments
continued to garner attention.

Peak said that as of Thursday after-
noon, the thread on Panther Lair ques-
tioning Cosgrove’s status as a former Pitt
player had more than 1,600 views.

and his assistant, Michele Perez, by phone,

The Pitt News tried to reach Cosgrove on .-

Facebook and Twitter. Both of his proﬁles
were later deactivated.

His Facebook account was deactivated
sometime after 5 p.m. Thursday. The user
did not respond to a message from The
Pitt News.

At about 9:25 p.m., a user on Cosgrove’s
Twitter account responded to a direct mes—
sage from The Pitt News that asked him to
respond ‘to accusations that were being
made against him online.

“What accusations?” the user asked in

a direct message. A '

About 10 minutes later, his Twitter ac-
count was deactivated before the user an-
swered another direct message that asked
whether he would be willing to talk over
the phone. i

But by Thursday evening, details in his
online presence that linked him to Panther
football were being edited.

 His Linkedln proﬁle and biography on

Pentec Health’s website were also amended ‘

to remove the claim that he had won two
varsity letters with Pitt football.

The settings for his proﬁle on Linke-
dIn were later changed so that users who

are not connected to Cosgrove could not '

View the page. By late Saturday afternoon,
Cosgrove’s Linkedln proﬁle no longer ap-
peared when The Pitt News searched for it.

At least six "messages left at Pentec

' Health asking for comment from Cosgrove

on Thursday and Friday went unreturned.
At least two of these messages were left
with Perez. 4

But users on Panther Lair continued to
show interest in Cosgrove.

As of Saturday, ‘four discussion threads
about him had been viewed more than
5,400 times with more than 100 replies.
These numbers were still growing at the
time of publication.

Instead of being outraged, fans on the
site were starting to react to Cosgrove’s
claim with sarcasm.

One thread titled “What’s your favorite
Joe Cosgrove moment?” mocked Cosgrove
by attributing other, patently false claims
to him. This thread had almost 700 views
and 24 replies Saturday.

“I clearly remember when he safely

landed U.S. Airways Flight 1549 in the
Hudson [River]. No one was injured,” one
Panther Lair user wrote sarcastically in a
reply to the thread. _

Peak said he thought Cosgrove was
misrepresenting himself when he spoke
to the ESPN reporter, but he was more
perplexed than angry.

“It’s just a strange story,” he said. “It’s ‘
bizarre that someone would concoct some-
thing like this. It remains kind of murky.
I’m curious to know the reaction of the Pitt
community after this comes out.’-’ I

Defending vegetarianism: Rebuttals to common arguments

Natalie Russell
Columnist

Yes, I’m avegetarian. And, no, I don’t
tell this to everyone I meet within
moments of introducing myself. The
stereotype of vegans and vegetar-
ians being overzealous hippies has
never accurately described anyone
I’ve personally met who share my
views. In fact, I’ve had more ag-
gression directed at me for my diet
than I’ve ever reciprocated toward
anyone else. Aside from being pre-
dictable and annoying, these con-
versations have made me wonder
why people ﬁnd my decision to not
eat meatso offensive or ridiculous.

So, in anticipation of these fre-
quently echoed arguments, I’ve

listed my a priori rebuttals.-

A “Your lack of meat consumption -
has a minimal — or zero -— effect
on the number of animals slaugh-
tered each year.” T

It’s true that only 5 percent of
Americans identify as vegetar-
ians and just 2 percent as vegans,
which, unfortunately, means that
our impact on the meat industry
is  But those who say the
effect is nonexistent don’t under-
stand the basic concept of supply
and demand. According to informa-
tion from the U.S. Department of
Agriculture and the U.S. Census Bu-
reau, a vegetarian saves more than
30 land animals each year. Again,
it’s not much, but it’s something.

But even ifbeing avegetarian did
have zero impact on the number of
animals slaughtered each year, not
eatingmeat is apersonal moral deci-
sion. I know that the cow that con-
tributed to the hamburger at Five
Guys has been dead for awhile now
and that the damage is done, but
that doesn’t change the fact that eat-
ingaproductthat came from aliving
animal killed ‘for my consumption

A is morally reprehensible. With that

logic, there would be no reason not
to participate in cannibalism or to
refrain from deﬁlinga dead human
body, either. It’s aboutbeing able to
live with yourselfwhen you support

protein, calcium, essential amino acids and
other nutrients most people obtain from-meat
and animal products. A grain-based diet can
account for all the nutrients necessary for
health. You just have to do your research and
pay closer attentipn to what you’re puttingin

be big help inniaking sure you’re meeting
your body"s‘}needs. » v

I .   an added"iclebate point: There are plenty

3 ofiglhhealtliy carnivorous dietsthatdon’tseem

tolilttract the animosity. Non—vegans
and non-vegetarians. are never asked about
their protein intake. There are athletes and

lifestyles on strict vegan diets. It’s difﬁcult,

sure, but not impossible.

“Evolution has conditioned us for a car-
nivorous diet.” _

This is an argument I usually hear from
students who have taken Introduction to Evo-
lutionary Theory and have, overnight, become
Darwin scholars. It’s well-known that there is
no scientiﬁc basis behind arguments such as
these. For example, men are not “naturally”
more inclined toward inﬁdelity because of
evolutionary history. The great thing about
evolution is that it didn’t stop in the caveman
era. Moreover, a study published in a2010 edi-'
tion of Social Psychology Quarterly supported

a theory that intelligent people are more likely
to adopt evolutionarily novel preferences and
values. In other words, exhibiting behaviors
similar to your ancestors is not necessarily
something to be proud of. '

We live in a world that makes it easy to
remain ignorant about immorality behind
the scenes. Individual choices won’t change
the world by themselves, but bridging the
gap in understanding can be a step toward
a public movement for real political reform.
Perhaps confronting the way wetreat animals
can also prevent callousnessin matters that
affect our own species. I

WOMEWS SOCCER
Team squanders

early lead, falls
to Virginia

Andrew Stern
Staff W riter

Pitt women’s soccer hung with top-
ranked Virginia for the early part of
Sunday afte,rnoon’s match. In the end,
however, Virginia’s talent prevailed and
led the Cavaliers to a 3-1 win.

“We knew that we didn’t match up too
well with them in terms of athleticism,
but we put together a pretty good game
plan and tried to hang in the game for
as long as we could,” head coach Greg
Miller said.

The afternoon started out promis-
ing for the home squad, as Pitt (4-5-1,
0-4-0 ACC) dominated Virginia (9-0-0,
3-0 ACC) and tallied a goal in the 11th
minute.

After gaining the Cavaliers’ side of
the ﬁeld, midﬁelder Roosa Arvas passed
to Dana DelleFemine, who was able to
stay onside and elude the Virginia back.
DelleFemine then ﬁred a perfect shot
into the back of the net.

The goal was 1—of-3 shots on goal for
the Panthers in the game and was the
ﬁrst conference score for the team.

“It happened so fast, so I was more
shocked than anything else,” Delle-
Femine said. “But my first hope was
that I was onside. After that Ijust made
sure to keep my focus and wait for the
perfect time to shoot.”

The goal gave Pitt a surprising 1-0
lead and a little bit of momentum. The
lead, however, would be short-lived, as
just a few minutes later Virginia tied
the game.

On the Cavs’ goal, junior forward
Danielle Colaprico was able to out-
dribble the Panthers’ defense and gain
a passing lane; Colaprico took advantage

Team drops two out of three matches over weekend

The women’s volleyball squad hosted the Pitt
Panther Invitational this weekend, bookend-
ing a win over Rutgers with losses to Cornell
and Morehead State.

Despite the losing record, Delaney Clesen
and Mechael Guess earned individual acclaim,
being named to the All—Toumament team for
their efforts.

The tournament marked head coach
Dan Fisher’s home debut with the Panthers,
though the results left little room for celebra-
tjon.

Cornell defeats Pitt 3-2 (15-25, 25-22, 14-

The invitational kicked off Friday mom— .

taking the ﬁrst set 25-15, Pitt squandered alate
lead in the second set, with Cornell winning
25-22. And despite its convincing capture of
the third set by a score of 25-14, Pitt went on
to lose the ﬁnal two sets and the match.

Fisher was not pleased with the perfor-
mance, saying, “It was a bad loss. We hadn’t
really had a bad loss yet, but that one was.
We were ﬂat.” ‘

juniorjessica Wynn echoed those state-
ments, remarking that the Panthers “played
beneath their level.”

Junior Kate Yeazel paced the team with 20
kills, while Lindsey Zitzke, also a junior, led
the Panthers with 25 assists. Delaney Clesen
chipped in with 15 digs added to the effort.

The evening doubleheaderwas a matchup
of former Big East foes, as Pitt faced off against
Rutgers.

The Panthers, edged out in an extremely
close ﬁrst set, lost early, 28-26. Things looked
dim for Pitt in the beginning of the second
set, as it fell to an early 14-9 deﬁcit. But the
Panthers stormed ahead, ending the set on
a 10-0 run. Sparked from the late rally, the
momentum carried the Panthers, who won
the next two sets and the match.

“Duringthat second set, we ﬁnally stepped
up,” said Wynn, who wrapped up amemorable

night with a season-high 18 kills and career-
best 23 digs. “Rutgers was ﬁghting back. We
needed to put them in their place.”

Fisher was pleased with Wynn’s perfor-
mance, saying, “Ithink shewas motivated. She
didn’t have her best game [against Cornell],
but she had one of her best games tonight
[against Rutgers] .”

When asked about the adjustments Fisher
made following the Cornell loss, Fisher said,
“We didn’t make many adjustments, we just

wanted to do some things better. Some of the
mistakes were tactical, but mainly, we just
wanted to play better.”

Virginia finished the game with 37
shots on goal, which led D’Agostino to
collect a career-high 10 saves.

“Our defense was phenomenal to-

a lot of shots, alleviating the amount of
challenging shots I had to deal with.”

The loss dropped the Panthers un-

this season. The Panthers’ challenges
won’t get much easier next game, as
the team has to face the defending na-

But Miller thinks his team will be up for
the challenge.

“North Carolina is similar in terms

“They come after you a little bit more

Morehead State Eagles.

The match was back-and-forth through-
out, but the Panthers couldn’t hold on to a 2-1

despite taking a 19-17 lead. Likewise in the
ﬁfth, the Panthers jumped out to a 5-2 lead

After yet another close match, Fisher

 

found some positives about the team’s pro-
pensity to play close games.

“We’ve lost some close matches, but we’ve
won some too,” he said. “Any time you’re com-
petitive in a match, that’s a good thing.”
