- Panthers t   Host EIG

Yale Favored to Cop
Title; Cats to Place

By 7MIKE DRAPKIN

The Pitt Wildwood Club will host the 26th annual_.East—
‘ern Collegiate Golf ‘Association tournament next weekend,
April 7-9. Approximately 100 golfers’ representing 16 Eastern
schools will participate in the tournament. V ' 7

Golf coach George Underwood stresses the fact that
Wildwood will not be open to students or faculty members

from April 6-9.
' Yale University, victor in six
out of the last seventournaments,
has been made the favorite again
this year. The University, linkmen
ﬁnished fifth last year and Coach
» Underwood-feels his squad is cap-
able of a similar, if not slightly
better performance _ this year.
p.‘ ,, Six Matches Remain
” ‘ Thus far this season the Pitt
golfers have compiled a 3-2 record
A with six matches remaining on the
schedule. ‘ 1
Coach" Underwood will enter
seven men in the tournament.
He gives Tom Treese and Ron
Dermit the bestchance among
’ the Pitt golfers to. capture in-
dividual honors in the stiff com-

petition. Trees shot a 69_ in the ‘

recent win over Duquesne.

Among the top_ contenders" re-
turning are Don Norbury of Penn,
last year’s winner, and Dick Bur-
goone of Penn State who earned
medal honors in last year’s com-
petition._ V ,

Jack ‘Nicklaus’. one of the top
amateur players in the country,
was expected to enter the tour-
nament, but he is unable to
make it. - ' ,

Thirty-six holes of medal play
will be played on Saturday to de-
terminethe low 16 scorers. The
 low scorers will then meet in
' match play Sunday and Monday

6

for individual places. The team
title will be decided by the total
of the low ﬁve scores after the
36 holes of medal play.

Tennis Hopes
Up as Season
Hits Mid-Point

With the tennis season at its
mid-point, things are looking bet-

ter for a successful season. Coach 

Bill Summers says, “The rough
part of the schedule -— Toledo,
Penn State and George Washing-
ton — is past. Maybe now We’ll
start moving against these less
powerful opponents we meet in
the last half of the year.”

Possessing a 2-6 record ‘now
(not including the
match), the Panthers will be try-
ing to take six of the remaining
eight meets. Summers will go with
his new lineup. Craig. Marshall
and Paul Ribisl have moved into
the singles play because of the
losses of Joe Valley and Ralph
Mason.

Ted Martens and Matt Zieman—
ski were elected co-captains this
year.

Injury. ' Ridden Nlitters Attempt

‘Comeback in Next 3 Contests

By JACK SMITH

Right now the Panther baseball team has more injuries‘

than a football team, and the way Coach Bobby Lewis is

switching his players around he is beginning to look like-

ffﬁ Casey Stengel.

In the next four days the‘Panthers_meet Clarion athome,
Duquesne at Forbes Field and_Bucknel1 away, trying to im-

, prove on their poor 3-7 mark. 4

’ . This has been a badseason for
Lewis’ nine. Nine is about all the
men Lewis has left. They started
out the season with a 'lack_._ of
depth. Then their hitting wou1dn’t
click. Now they are plaguednby
. injuries and the future doesn’t
look good. '
Six of the Panthers top per-
formers are hampered by in-
r «juries. The worst of them is-
second-baseman Pete Colangelo
who suffered a broken ankle last .
week. He will be out for the rest
of the season. Others ﬁlling out
the group that looks like a hos-
pital sick bay list are Ron
Maser, sore knee; Pete Suder,
charley horse; Fred -Lanning-
ham, sore groin _muscle, Bob
Conti and‘ Lauren Guthrie, sore
arms.
Suder has been playing short-
.. Etop despite his injury and is one
3’ of the few Panthers whose hits
have been ﬁnding the -holes. An-
other of the few hitters is“Corky

After a successful weekend at the Penn Relays the Pan— 1

meet victory as they travel to West Virginia on Friday.
I “No competition” is what Coach Carl Rees claimed last "
year after the Panthers clobbered West Virginia 105-21. The
Mounties brought a seven man squad to the Stadium. They
can be expected to man a 1arge1'O ' \

reach this season. Kanell, on the
other hand, only threw the dis-

his best throw.

‘As the season has progresseglv‘
the Panthers are improving. There
is little cyuestionﬂ that they will
continue to improve against the

‘Refreshingly Realistic’ ,

She is, above all else, refresh-

ly showing that a part of life
is worth having despite eventual
pain and loneliness. ‘

Her observations are fresh,
accurate, and ‘written with a
tightness of style which is wel-
come in an area of fiction where
maudlin overstatement is often
the rule rather than the excep--
tion.

At times the aristocratic in-
trigue and fear of social reper-

too accurately imagined, and the
author "seems to feel compelled to
develop this aspect to its highest
degree.

But this is a small matter when
one realizes that,‘ within the nec-
essarily limited scope which a plot
based on one short love affair

’ would afford, two characters and
