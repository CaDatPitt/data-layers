Interfraternity
Ball To Feature
Jack Miles Band

William Penn Hotel To Be Scene
On February 16 Of Annual
Affair; Price Set At $3

 

 

Jack Miles and his “band of
bands” will play for the annual In-
terfraternity ball on February 16 in
the grand ball room of the VVilliam
Penn hotel, it was announced today
by Leroy Lewis, C-34, and chairman
-of the dance.

The affair, which annually provides
the outlet for fraternity enthusiasm,
is expected to be another one of the

type which is always singled
out on the undergraduate cal-
endar. The acquisition of a nation-

ally—famous band, and the scaling of
prices down to $3 per couple is ex-
pected to provide the stimulus for one
of the largest gatherings of the sea-
son. One dollar reservation tickets
are also on sale on the campus and
may be redeemed either at the door
or prior to the dance.

Program favors will be but one of
the many features of the dance, the
committee in cha.rge promising to out-
do all predecessors in the matter of
entertainment.

The orchestra selected for this
event is directed by Jack Miles, for-
mer featured trombonist with Guy
Lombardo. The orchestra has been
heard over both national networks,
and has been featured at the Granada
cafe, Chicago, Lotus Gardens and
Golden Pheasant cafes, Cleveland, and
Hollywood Gardens, New York,

Tickets for the affair may be pur-,
chased from any of the following com-3
mittee members:

Bob Willison, Delta Tau Delta;

By BERNARD FLEMING

Before a gathering of about 250
students at VVedncsday’s inquiry
forum, Judge Eugene C. Bonniwell, of
the Municipal court of Philadelphia,
described as archaic, legislative and
judiciary units of Pennsylvania, forced
upon the state by a constitution
evolved from medieval England.
Judge Bouniwell cited Philadelphia’s
municipal court as an example of one
of the finest and most advanced courts
of justice in the world.

“This court was created from a
political move of the Republicans
when they were defeated and lost
some 4000 jobs for their constituents.
The object of the Republican machine
was to elect the nine judges of the
newly created court who were fa-
vorable to the Vare and Penrose
machine and to ﬁll the appointive
positions with party men.

CWA Men Will Finish Exterior
Stonework By February 15

 

 

VVhile professors shout above the
din of drilling tools and students
strain their ears to hear more than
the hammering of workers, construc-
tion of the unﬁnished Cathedral goes
on rap-idly.‘ Fair weather has enabled
the workmen to move more rapidly
than was expected, and it is estimated
that. by February 15 the stone work
on the lower ﬂoors will be completely
set. All of the stone needed to ﬁnish
the Cathedral is on the site now ex-
cept that necessary for the entrances,
which has been ordered for early
delivery.

Congressional enactment during the
next few days will determine
whether CWA assistance will extend
beyond February 15, the date original-
ly set for the closing of federal aid.
Work will probably start March 1 on
the unﬁnished top of the tower. Final
plans were submitted about a year
ago for the new design. which alters
the present top and parapet. A few
set will be torn away

frets will carry the sheer lines of the
building upward forty feet more, The
top, as it is now, will be an observa-
tion platform. with a. lounge room
just below.

Just 35 per cent of the work
that is being done shows from the
outside. Most of the necessary work
being done in laying steam mains,
water mains, electric cables and ma-
chinery is not visible. The building
will be heated by a plant situated be-
yond the Carnegie institute, which
heats that building, the University,
and the Mellon institute.

heard Dr. Paul H. Douglas, professor
of industrial relations at the Univer-
,sity of Chicago, speak here VVednes-
Eday afternoon at an economics sem-
Einar meeting in the Cathedral.
'; Declaring that the day of laissez-
?faire is dead and that the United
,States is entering upon an era of
{controlled capitalism, Dr_ Douglas
fcautioned, “There is grave danger that
icontrolled capitalism here may end
iup with control by the owners of in-
idustry. Industry may be enabled to
ﬁx output and to adjust prices, form-
ing a type of cartel like that in Ger-
many.”

The speaker condemned the open
price association in industry, stress-
ing its tendency to keep prices high.
He urged further protection for wage
workers and consumers and demanded
free selling prices after the worst
types of unfair competition have been
removed.

NRA May Finish In Control Of Owners
Of Industry, Douglas Warns At Seminar‘

 

“It may be one of the ironies of

history that liberals will unwittingly
give power to owners of large in-
dustries,” the Chicago professor said.
“The influence of employers, under
the new laws, may leave the economic
field for social and political ﬁelds.”

“Under the NRA,” Dr. Douglas con-
tinued, “workers are merely permitted
to organize, whereas associations of
employers is practically obligatory.
For a balanced economy, we must,
make associations of workers as
mandatory as those of employers.” ,

Chief of the Bureau of Economic‘;
Education, working under the National }
Emergency council, Professor Doug-I,
las stressed the difﬁculty of consumeri
organization in the United States. He g
pointed out, however, that 2850 con-L
sumer councils have been organized
throughout the country.

Shifting to the political ﬁeld, the
speaker emphasized,
continue as a democracy, an entire-

ly new party system must be built[

up. The present Republicans, though
now lacking effective leadership, are
likely to become the Constitutional-
ists.”

tion.

Sieg Announces
College Changes
In Requirements

 

Wider Course Selection Offered
Students; Foreign Language
Will Not Be Required

 

Three important changes in the re-
quirements for entrance to and for
graduation from the College were re-
leased yesterday to the News for pub-
lication. The purpose of these changes.
according to Dr, L. P. Sieg, dean Of
the College, and the Curriculum com-
mittee, wiich drafted the changes, is
to open to students in search of de-
grees a wider or a deeper selection of
courses.

The exact text of the new require-

ments, which take effect with the be-
Iginning of this semester, follows:
' The entrance units to the-
freshman class of the College-
shall include two years of one
foreign language, Students lack-
ing these units must take two.
years of foreign language in col--
lege for which college credit will.‘
be given upon the , satisfactory
completion of these courses.

2. Entrance requirements shall
be completely severed from grad-
uation requirements, such_action
to be interpreted as removing any
speciﬁc foreign language require-
ment for graduation (with the ex-
ception made in requirement num-
ber 1),

3. Each candidate for a degree
from the College (excepting those
pursuing one of the curricula com-
bined with a professional course)

[ shall be required so to plan his
i curriculum that upon graduation
I he will have earned twelve credits
, in each of the three existing ﬁelds
‘ of distribution in addition to the

required courses in English, i. e.,

English 1 (2), 21 (22). The re-

i quirement in Field C must in-
l elude eight credits in laboratory
‘ sciences.

The ﬁrst two of the above changes
:are self-explanatory. The third was ex-
plained by Dean Sieg as meaning that
the credits earned by students toward
their major and minor will, from now
on, be allowed to “overlap” with and
be counted as pa1't of the credits in
their respective distribution ﬁelds
(Group A, B or C). Th_is will allow
students much more freedom in the se-
lection of courses they desire, and
will tend to increase the number of
elective subjects. ,

The Curriculum committee has

worked several years on the proposed
changes and only recently completed
the list and submitted it to the fac-
Iulty for consideration. Present mem-
bers of the committee are Dr. Geb--
hard Stegeman, professor
istry; Dr, George Ellis
fessor of psychology; Miss Blossom L..
Henry, assistant professor of modern-.«
languages, and Dr. Mont R, Gabbert,_
professor and head of the department
of philosophy.

This completed report of the com-
mittee was submitted to the faculty
in ballot form, and subsequently
adopted. It was put into effect at
the beginning of this semester, and
will appear in the new College cat-
alog, which will be published in May.

Lunde; Talks To Groups

 

 

 

I
s

W. A. Lunden, assistant professor
of sociology, addressed two groups}
last week on sociological problems.
Monday he addressed the Oakmont,
junior WOnlel1’S club on the subject of
“Crime in Our Own Streets,” in which
he noted how little we actually know
of real criminality. Before the Min-,
isterizil association of Braddock, he
discussed “Sociological Change and
Contemporary Theology.” Mr. Lunden
was formerly a minister himself and
teaches a course in sociology and re-
. ligious thought,

“How’re yiili, Smitli?” George spat.
Then Smith launched into one of
his high-powered sales talks, not new
to Hicks, contending that he could in-
crease his business twofold in three;

..x.x.x.x -x-.

months if he would throw out the, '
junk on his shelves that had once :3 L ’
been “stock,” and ﬁll them with 13  3  

53335333

some quality products like those put
out by his house. And Smith probably
was right.

Hicks explained that there was no
use talking about it, that maybe his
store wasn’t up to date but that he
managed to get along all right, and
that he wasn't going to buy a lot of
stuff that he knew he couldn’t pay for. ‘

Smith set his case on the porch,

Freshman Dance
Nets High Proﬁt

$54.44 Total Is Highest Return
From Dance This Year

 

 

Final figures on the Freshman
dance, released yesterday by Chair-
man Edwin H. Beachler, C37, in-
dicate that this dance has yielded the
most -proﬁt for dances this year, a
sum of $54.44.

Beachler attributed the success of
the dance to the support of his com-
mittee and the assistance of Walter
J. Rome and William Daufenbach, as-
sistants to the dean of men.

Novel features introduced were un-
veiling the class numerals during the
grand march, and the use of revolving
lights on the dance ﬂoor.

Business Review Indicates Slight
Decline In Activity For‘Janu‘ary

Graduates Hear
Dr. Yeager Talk

Number Of Trained Men, Women
In Graduate School Landed

 

Speaking be-fore groups of graduate:
students in various education classes
January 20, Dr. William A. Yeager,
assistant director of the Teach-
ers’ bureau, Department of Pub-
lic Instruction, Harrisburg, outlined in
general the educational situation in
Pennsylvania, and discussed certiﬁca-
tion trends.

Dr. Yeager was gratiﬁed to see the
interest, enthusiasm and desire to
acquire advanced training which
teachers, supervisors and school ad-
ministrators in this vicinity show by
enrolling in graduate classes at the
University.

“it is evident that the school men
and women of the Pittsburgh district
are anxious to promote their profes-
sional interests and that the School
of Education of the University of
Pittsburgh is providing the right type
of training,” he said.

Among the groups visited by Dr.
Yeager were a large graduate seminar
and a class in educational adminis-
tration, conducted by Dr. Q. A. W.
Rohrbach; a research class of more
than 70 students, which is under
the direction of Dr. C..A_ Buckner;
a class in supervision of instruction,
which is taught by Dr, G. A. Yoakam;
a philosophy of education class, taught
by Dr. P. E. Harris; and Mr. M. P.
Chworowsky’s graduate class in the
work of the activity type school.

Reduction In Steel, Textile
Output Cause Of Reaction

 

General business activity in the
United States showed a slight reac-
tion in the ﬁrst half of January after
improving substantially from about
the middle of November to the end
of the year, according to the Pitts-
burgh Business Review, monthly pub-
lication of the University bureau of
business rese-arch.

The Review declared that the de-

cline came partly because of a re-
duction in the operating rate of sev-
eral important industries, notably the
steel industry and the textile industry,
and a decline in freight car loadings.

Electric power production increased
moderately in December, but fell
somewhat in January. Production of
automobiles showed a pronounced rise
in December, and operating schedules
were further expanded early in Jan-
uary. This increase was largely a
result of ihe ..i.n.U-‘0dac,t_ion _.1_..1.e_.vz,.
models at automoliile shows through-
out the country.

Building increased substantially in
December, total contracts awarded for
all types of construction being the
largest in any month for two years.
This, the Review pointed out, could
easily be accounted to the great in-
crease in public works and to the
CWA during the last year and a half.
There was a further gain in residen-
tial construction, the Review also
pointed out.

Retail and wholesale trade held up
moderately well in December, the long
downward trend in the dollar volume
of wholesale and retail sales being
checked during the past year.

In reviewing business conditions
during the past iyear, the Re-
view stated that ﬁnancial develop-
ments have clearly dominated the
trend of general business in the past
three or four months. These included
strengthening a large number of
banks through the selling of pre-
ferred stock to the RFC and through
the Banking act of 1933, which pro-
tects bank deposits.

Other ﬁnancial developments were
the national budget, in which it was
indicated that some .$10,000,000,000
would have to be borrowed during the
next few months and the Administra-
tlon’s monetary policy, which calls for
revaluation of the dollar.

Total farm income in 1933 was al-
most one—fourth larger than in 1932,
according to estimates of the United
States department of agriculture, in-
cluded in the current issue of the Re-
view, and, although farm incomes re-
main low in terms of prices farmers
must pay, the favorable effect of this
increase in farm income on the
market has been felt in all farm
trading centers,

WAA Develops
Award System

 

 

 

Yellow Felt Keystone With Blue
Letters To Be Given

 

Until three years ago WAA used a
system of awards for athletic activity
which proved unsuccessful and was
discarded. With the announcement of
a new sports schedule, a new system
of awards has been devised which is
planned to stimulate interest in wom-
ens’ sports and also interest in WAA.

A yellow felt keystone with blue
lettering will be given the ﬁrst year
and blue bars will be added each suc-
ceeding year,

The total number of points awarded
has been set as seventy—ﬁve, with
twenty-ﬁve being earned each sea-
son. The twenty-ﬁve points will be
credited for an average of two hours
practice per week for non majors and
four hours for major students. At-
tendance at over night hikes will be
counted as twoihours, and day hikes
will count as one.

Besides sporting activities, credit
will be given for work on committees
for social events. Committee work
will count as a two hour practice and
work on preparing four WAA
mnweons will count as one hour of

practice.

The new sports schedule became ef-
fective with the beginning of the
second semester. The schedule in-
cludes indoor baseball, ﬁfth and sixth
hours Monday and fourth and ﬁfth
hours on Wednestlay and Thursday;
basketball, fifth and sixth hours Tues-
day, Wednesday and Thursday; danc-
ing, third and fourth hours Tuesday
and second and third hours on Thurs-
day. The swimming activities will
take place on Monday and Friday.
The Monday hours will be from 1:30
to 2:30 o’clock and from 4:30 to 5
o’clock. On Friday they will be from
4:20 until 5 o’clock.

Each Monday during the ﬁfth hour
WAA will conduct an activity hour
at Heinz House with the freshman
sports unit in charge every other Mon-
day. A program of games and social
dancing has been planned. The ﬁrst
meeting Monday is in‘ charge of the
freshman unit and will be especially
for freshmen.

Inter-class basketball tournaments
are being arranged at the gym under
the direction of June Watson, Ed_34,
basketball chairman of WAA, with
Mary Lou Dowling. C37, manager of
the freshman class; Ruth Marzolf, C36,
the sophomore class; Annetta Ward-
ley, Ed35, the juniors, and Ernestine

at Heinz House January 22 at 12:30

cabinet to have a basis from which
to work.

to consider the future of the Pitt
kely mourn the graduation of his

co-captains, Russ Ochsenhirt, Charley Ilughes, and Don McCa1nant.
However, if this column can be permitted to oﬁer a suggestion, we
will suggest three men, whom we consider the cream of the present

crop of freshman cagcis. These th

ree men, in our opinion, are good

enough to make practically any college traveling squad, and are im-

proving daily. The three we have in‘:
mind are Ross Emerick, Ralph Fer-
guson, and Billy Jesko.

Emerick, in our opinion, is the
number one man of the trio, A
sure shot with an uncanny abil-
ity for retrieving the ball from
the “board” and the willingness
to cooperate with the other four
men on the floor makes this boy
one of the best prospects to come
up to Dr. Carlson in many a year.
With the capable coaching that
Dr. Carlson alone can give, We
have no doubt that Emerick will
capably fill Charley Hughes’ va-
cant position. Thank you, Swiss-
vale High,

C a r I s o n Asks Special
Courtesy To Army,
Westminster

Dr. H. Clifford Carlson, in a
statement made to the Pitt News
yesterday, expressed the hope
that Pitt fans will conduct them-
selves in a sportsmanlike man-
mer for the two remaining home
games on the Pitt schedule:

The Panther ﬂoor coach re-
marked that he is particularly
anxious for a ﬁne reception to
both the Army quintet, coming
here tomorrow night, and the
‘Westminster Titans, recently add-
ed to the Pitt card for a game
here on Wednesday, February
21. Both these outﬁts are sports-
men of the highest degree and
will merit particular good will
from the Pitt fans.

In an effort to point out the
worthlessness of the fellow who
gets his enjoyment from a basket-
ball game by booing anyone‘ and
everyone, Carlson has prepared
the following brief article on the
subject:

“B00” is the Piker’s nearest ap-
proach to a boost. He is the
brave boy who hides behind a
post or his friends, and tries to
tear down somebody. He is the
fellow who cannot do anything
himself, but continually belittles
some other person. The booer
has no courage. He has been
licked in life so often that the
only thing he knows is to criti-
cize someone, who is still trying.
The booer is the fellow, who de-
velops into an efficient wife-beat-
er and a bully of weaklings. If
that is your ambition, go ahead
and boo. In life’s game you will
hurt no one but yourself by boo-
mg.

Swimming Team
To Meet Delaware

Visitors’ First C 0 iii e r e n c e
Appearance This Year

Tonight at 8 o'clock in Trees pool
the Panther swimmers will meet the
Delaware university swimming team
in an Eastern Intercollegiate meet. It
will be the second league meet for
the Pitt team and the first for the
Delaware team, and it will be Dela-
wa.re’s ﬁrst collegiate meet of the
season.

Coach Corr will probably start the
same team that defeated Ohio State.
Herman Adlersberg and Paul Stinner
ﬁnished ﬁrst and second respectively
in the Tech and Ohio State meets,

Although Russel Lindberg is a few
seconds faster in the 220 than any
of his team mates, he will likely be
held out of the event, which will en-
able him to enter the 150-yard back-
stroke race fresh. In the Ohio State
meet, after swimming the 220, in which
he set a new pool record, he entered
the backstroke race tired and as a
result ﬁnished second. Coach Corr
will likely enter VVilliam Lewis and
Jack Denny in the 220, which will en-
able Lindberg to meet Vvilliam Croe,
Delaware backstroker, who holds sev-
eral Delaware pool records, on even
terms.

John Carik, who took ﬁrst in diving
against Tech and Ohio State, will be
given plenty of opposition by Del-
aware’s entry, Harry \Vilson. Jack
Hanna and VVillia1n Swazuk will swim
the 440-yard free style race. Russell
Lindberg and Joe Jones will swim the
150-yard back stroke event, opposed
by Bill Croe of Delaware.

The Panther breast strokers, Adlers-
berg and Sclimeiler, will meet in Len
Barker, Delaware captain, one of the
best breast stroke swimmers in the
conference. Denny and Ruhe or Mad-
den will swim the 100-yard free style
race. The Pitt relay team will be
made up of Ruhe or Madden, depend-
ing on which one swims the 100
Paul Stinner, Charles Chambers, Paul
Stinner and Jack Hanna.

The Panther swimmers set four
new district swimming records and
won three swimming meets in the
past two weeks. Carnegie Tech was
defeated in the Tartan pool on Jan-
uary 24 by a score of 52 to 20, the
Panthers took ﬁrst place in the AMA
meet on January 27 by winning two
places, and defeated Ohio State in
Trees pool on February 2, in a close

meet, 42 to 29.

Russell Lindberg, swimming his
ﬁrst year on the varsity, set three
new records, one a new Allegheny
Mountain association 50-yard record.
and two pool records. One record, the
150-yard back stroke, was made in
the Tech pool, and another record
for 220-yards free style in Trees pool.
Jack Hanna also turned in a record
breaking time in the Tech meet for
440-yards free style.

In the meet with Carnegie Tech the
Panthers won every first place except
the relay, which was won by Tech
on a disqualiﬁcation,

Panthers Topple
Dukes For Fifth
Straight Victory

Pitt Gains Fourth Conference
Win In West Virginia Tilt;
Seconds Defeat W&J

 

Finally overcoming the jinx which
had cast its spell over the Panthers
in four previous games with Dil-
quesiie’s Dukes, the Pitt basketball
gang took the Hilltoppers into camp
Tuesday night at the Stadium to
throw the city title race into a tie and
run the Panthers’ win streak to ﬁve

straight.
With Slim Wainio leading the pro-
cession, Carlson’s men rained in

enough baskets to keep out ahead of
the Dukes“ for the best part of the
game and the ﬁnal wild minute of
play found this same Wainio coming
through with the all—important two
points which meant the victory.

Clare Cribbs played his usual ba1ig-
up game and accounted for eight
points during the evening. Willie and
Charley Hughes garnered six and ﬁve
points respectively to help out the

Panther cause. Feldman and Birch
were the leading scorers for the
Dukes.

Pitt hopped away to an early lead
and maintained it at the end of the
first half, 17-13. Starting the second
half with a spurt, the Dukes pulled up
even with the Panthers at 20-20 when .
half of the second period was gone.l
Feldman and Moore put Duquesne
ahead with ﬁeld goals but after Char-
ley Hughes made good on a sensa-
tional shot from a corner, VVainio be-
gan his barrage and the game was in
for the Panthers. The seven points
he scored at this stage of the game
and the two he made in the ﬁrst half
gave him a grand total of nine and
enabled him to lead the Pitt scorers.

Victory came in a rather easy
fashion in the games Pitt played dur-
ing the examination and recess
period, the Panthers doubling the
West Virginia score to win, 42-21, and
swamping W. & J., 60-36_

West Virginia didn’t offer much
more than Joe Stydahar, towering
center, and Cribbs handled the Moun-
taineer star in a very capable man-
ner besides gathering seven points
himself. Willie Hughes was the scor-
ing star with seven ﬁeld goals, of
every variety, to his credit. Russ
Ochsenhirt was close behind with a
total of 13 points in the somewhat
drab game which gave Pitt its fourth
Intercollegiate Conference victory,

The Presidents of VVasliington and
Jefferson _weren’t even a. match for
the Pitt second-stringers who played
most of the game. Wainio was the
Panther star in this game, also, with
11 points. That the Presidents failed
to count a ﬁeld goal until after the
iirst 11 minutes of the game had gone
is an indication of the opposition they
afforded Pitt.

Plans are under way for freshman

carried out, which seems most likely,
it will assure a Pitt freshman team of
