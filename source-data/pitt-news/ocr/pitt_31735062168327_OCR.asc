Senate Council

Business, Recess, Women Mark Mete

by VIRGINIA JOYCE
Associate Editor

Chancellor Wesley Posvar drop-
ped a few bombshells at the Uni-
versity Senate Council meeting,
one of which was announcement
of the creation of a new Vice-
Chancellory.

Following a survey of 50 com-
parable universities, Dr. Posvar
reached the conclusion that Vice-
Chancellor of ' Finance Edison
Montgomery needs some help.

The help will come through with -

the addition of an administrative

position of “business officer.”
Speaking in general terms at

the July 13 "session held in the

Babcock Room on the 42nd floor.

of the Cathedral, the chief ad-

V ministrator commented that Mon-
A tgomery’s’span of responsibility

was "too large for one person.”
He hopes that the new officer
will lighten the loads of both
himself and Montgomery.

I Montgomery will retain the du-
__ ties of main budget planner and

 

CH ANCELLOR POSVAR

coordinator. Posvar, envisions that
he will have more time to become
involved in “policy decisions,” re-
lations with the University and the
faculty.

The new Vice-Chancellor. as
yet unnamed, will assist Mont-
gomery and provide _“a link with
other areas of the University“
from which the present adminis-
trator's burden excludes him.

VlCE—CHANCE|.I.OR Montgomery

‘This move is necessitated by
the growth of the administrative
services of the University in the
last. five years." explained the
Chancellor. “This institution has
grown twice as large and three
times as complex and we conse-
quently need to review our or-
ganization. "

  Student Group Fights
  e To Rescue Duff Park

bylDBlmNhl

Environmental Action at the
Universitv has announced its sup-
port of a plan to improve the pre-
sent Route 22 near Murrysville
instead of bull ing a new highway
through Duff ark, a local nature

reserve‘ and recreational area.

    

JA BAKER

The announcement, made by
group coordinator lMarc Hiller.
followed a meeting Thursday
night which was attended by rep-.
resentatives of Environmental
Action. the Pennsylvania Depart-
ment of Transportation,
Franklin -Township Park Commis-
sion, and the Roundtop Civic As-
sociation.

A total of seven alternatives "
 have been proposed by the Trans-

portation Bureau. Plan “B,” the
bypass which would take 41 acres
from the center of Duff Park, is

-apparently the favored route by

the department and’ by local resi-
dents and businessmen.

In addition. Plan "B" would re-
move 47 residences and 17 busi-
nesses. displace 165 persons. and
cost$16.718,821.

Plan  on the other hand.
which is supported by Environ-
mental Action and other local

 conservationists, _ would remove
de_nces and "36_ businesses. l_, — '-

 
 
  

 
  
 

—; and 90$

 

the ,.

Looking at these figures. Hiller

pointed out that the upgrading of I

Route 22 is superior in ‘each case
to making the new road through
the park, except for the number

of businesses that would be relo-

cated.

In a prepared statement, En-
vironmental Action members Hil-
ler, Ed Conley, and Jan Baker
said, “We are not as concerned
with the inconveniences to busi-
ness or industry that would be en-
countered with the upgrading of
Route 22. We are, however, much
more concerned about saving the
wilderness for future generations.

Business and industry can be re- .

located. Thelittle remaining wild-
erness, however, cannot.”

An opposing point of View was
presented at the meeting by Mich-
ael Stuhldreher. secretary of the
Roundtop Civic Association. a
group of residents whose homes
would be removed by some of the
alternate plans suggested by the

» Transportation Department.

According to Stuhldreher. Plan
"B" would be “the most feasible
and economical." Prime impor-
tance. he felt. should be placed on
avoiding disruption of businesses
and on allowing for the expansion
of Murrysville.

He also speculated that if the
busi

      
       
  

 
 

  
  
  
 

 nins’ Mu *

 

ED CONLEY

were removed for the new.inter-
state-type highway, most of the
local business would be diverted
to a secondary business area
along Old Route 22, which at this
time could not handle the influx of
consumer traffic.

Dr. James E. Townsend. chair-
man of the Franklin Township
Park Commission. tenaciously ar-
gued for‘ the complete preserva-
tion of Duff Park. He favored a
third route which would bypass
both the park and the present
business district.

Such a plan would carry an es-
timated price tag of over $24 mil-
lion. however. and would cut

through, forests adjacent to Duff

Park. ‘

Although conservationists and
park commission members noted
that the adjacent land was greatly
inferior to the area in Duff Park,
the Environmental Action state-
ment maintained that building a
road through that land would be
unwise. “We can ‘by no means en-
dorse any plan that would result
in the raping of any of our natural
lands,” they said. “Such would
be the case with any plan except
the proposed Plan “A!”

Environmental Action’ drew up

.a formal statement andpresented
it at an open hearing Tuesday eve- ’

'll_e. ’

    

in the Fall. Posvar set the dates
for Nov. 2-3. The movewill elim-
inate two days of the reading per-
iod before final ' examinations.
Dec. 8-9. and move classes up ac-
cordingly.

All services. including the li-
brary. administrative offices. etc.
will function as normal during the
recess. According to Dr. Posvar.
the decision directly affects only
the FAS calendar. but other
schools will have the option to fol-
low suit. .

Montgomery Named 
A Development Dean 

by EVAN PATTAK
Feature Editor

Following ten weeks of scrutin-
izing and interviewing candidates
from across the nation. Assistant
Chancellor for Student Affairs
Bernard Kobosky announced last
week the appointment of Dr.
Charles Donald Montgomery to
the newly-created position of dean
of Student Development.

‘ Montgomery’s appointment is

the culmination of a meticulous’

two-and-one‘-half month _search by
a nine-member committee select-
ed to examine all applications. In
addition‘ to interviews and person-
al recommendations, the search
committee based their decision in
part on suggestions offered dur-
ing open hearings. ‘,

Carl Van Horn, who sat on the
search committee, revealed that
Montgomery’s name was one of
four ultimately recommended to
Kobosky, who made the final deci-
sion. f‘The committee" was parti-
cularly impressed,” noted Van
Horn, “with Montgomery’s sin-
cerity and ability to relate to stu-
dents.”

Terming that ability "softechar-
isma," Van Horn related that all

‘involved in the decision-making

process were pleased with the re-
sults. ‘

of Mrs._ Schneewind and Roberta

ing three months of investigation
regarding establishment of the
center, the women submitted a‘

._proposal to Chancellor Wesley

agreed then that studenrscould be

But he injected a somber note
when dealing with the financial
aspect.

MONEY

He estimated that it would cost
in the neighborhood of $800 _per
student and could possibly drain
funds from student aid in other
areas. The Chancellor was pessi-
mistic about federal support for
the project. labelling it a “com-
mercial enterprise.“

Nancy Van Vuuren. history in-
structor and representative of the
University Committee for Wom-
en's Rights <UCWR) suggested
that “a commitment to human
needs be made.“

She was joined by Dr. Ina Brad-
en. president to the UCWR. in cit-
ing areas of University procedure
in which women are experiencing
discriminatory practices.

Mrs. Van Vuuren narrowed her
complaints down to three areas:
counselling (where women have
been stunted in career aspira-
tions, self-identities and question-
ed on their “sexual behavior“ be-
fore admission): personnel (in

which job classifications and sal- -

ary levels fail to match corres-
ponding male positions) and
placement (controlled exclusively
by men. most of whom are over

50).

.l’}>‘ A

FOUL PLAY

Dr. Braden refuted the charges
that women have a higher drop-
out rate than men in specific
areas and that they are guilty of
more absenteeism and less moti-
vation. ‘

She cited statistics. that 85-90
per cent of women graduates have
been found to be employed in
their chosen professions 10 years
after graduation.

part of University administrators
and personnel, suggesting that a
definite appartus be established
to combat discrimination. One
idea was the set up of a co-chan-
cellor or vice—chancellor.

Posvar expressed "sentivity"
to the appeals. promising that
University files would be made
accessible for inspection.

ANOTHER BOMB
The Chancellor dropped a self-
labelled “bombshell" when he

submitted a proposal to the Sen-
ate Committee on Faculty Health
and Welfare to lower the retire-
ment age to 65 from its prior lev-
el of 70.

He felt that such a move would
bring "the policies of the Univer-
sity into line with other universi-
ties.“

A report on the latest admission
figures caused a stir among the
members. It was revealed that a
total of 2.404 freshmen will be en-
tering the University in the Fall:
328. roughly 13 per cent of whom
will be black.

The figure constitutes a rise of
about 160 admittees over last
years.

Dean‘of the College of Arts and
Sciences Dr. Jerome Schneewind
expressed concern over the
"chronic room shortage.“

Posvar interjected that. despite
the figures. the University is not
operating on a quota system. “In
fact. he said." the College and
UCEP will begin recruiting low
income whites from the area for
UCEP.“

TWO ‘SCHOOLS’

Discussion on two Schools at
the University, oneoperational
and the other still in the “talk
stage" centered around minority
questions.

Prefacing that the School of
General Studies "should be consi-
dered asra highly qualified area
compatible with the other areas
here." the Chancellor criticized
the School on its “minority treat-
ment.“

“The School must devlop a poli-
cy of integrating minority mem-
bers." he said. “It must operate
 a microcosm of the University
itself.“

Dr. Posvar suggested that the
School could attain these goals
and as an end product be "self-
sufficient.“

Puerto Rico, A I

 Little United States

(Editor's Note: Michael Simon has been a reporter for the Pitt News

I for nearly two terms now. After the Winter term ended, he and one of his
’ friends as he describes in the article, went to Puerto Rico. These are his
perceptions and responses to the island.

MICHAEL SIMON
v Staff Writer

In the eyes of United States’ business, Puerto. Rico, a virtually
tax-free semi-tropical island, is a mecca for its large industries.

Puerto Ricans living in the small towns and vill_ages see the

—‘*situation with a different perspective. To them, working for the

Americans is a degrading, vicious circle. They are paid poor wages
for work in the_American—owned factories, and they then are expect-
ed to live and adjust to an imposed capitalist economic system.

In a bizarre effort to identify with the Americans, Puerto Ric-

‘ ~ ans view automobiles as status symbols. Outside of practically any

Puerto Rican home, usually a shoddy, three room concrete pre-fab,
sits several U.S. made cars, one of which might work.

They buy cars on long term credit with high interest rates
while their children are improperly dressed, poorly fed, and are liv-

‘ ing in generally filthy squalor.

In any of the large cities, San Juan. for example, immense ho-
tels and new office buildings crowd the landscape, putting on a fa-
cade of prosperity and cleanliness. Puerto Ricans living in these

 -large cities are better off’, but these people constitute a small min-
' ority of the population.‘ -

The sad fact of the matter is’ that Puerto Rico was thrust into a
life style that it wasn't ready for. People can't go from a simple
agricultural life into an industrial economic entity supported by

' $3,000.000,000 from U.S. business.

. The large Gross National Product is the result of the prosper-
ity of a wealthy minority. The average, small-town Puerto Rican is

 7 caught in a warp between two ways of life —— either try and break
‘ in on the American system without an education or proper orienta-.

tion, or starve because the old Puerto Rican agricultural way of life

A is no longer sufficient. .

We, the Americans are hated and despised with a confused but
righteous smouldering fury. The islanders do not differentiate be-
tween the American businessman and the tourist. To them, we are
a white, English-speaking cancer. ’

I know; I was in Puerto Rico. A friend and I went to a small
town to camp out on the beach. In the space of forty-eight hours,
we had one attempt on our lives and one attempted robbery. The
Americans in the town gave us a warning, stating that the Puerto
Ricans would steal us blind andput us in jail without any provo-
cation. Finally, the townspeoples' absolute refusal to give us any
help whatsoever caused our, needless to say. hasty departure.

We can't even solve. or begin to solve our own problems. yet
~ we continue to give other countries our "expert assistance“.
To rid a country of disease is good, and no doubt, some of our
‘_ aid has always had humanitarian intentions. -We are however, doing
more harm_than good with our Puerto Rican business venture.

What works t'or us may not be good for Puerto Rico. After all,
we are not gods. so why should other countries be shaped in our

But Compared To What?

by IAN MICHAEL HEISS
Contributing Columnist

This is a question often put to those who would
change the American system. People who ask or. as
the case may be, throw this question at demonstra-
tors usually follow the line of thinking set out by
the DAR award winning speaker at the Washington,
D. C., America Day rally. “Show me another coun-
try with as much’creativity. meat and potatoes,
Americans as America. and then I will think of go-
ing elsewhere.

The general gist of it is that things are better

. here in America than any other nation in the world,
and that is true. This is the land of meat and pota- _

toes and creativity, sometimes I fear in that order.
HAVING THIS truth firmly set in their mind,
the more vocal of the silent majority say—scream
—whisper' "if this was Russia they'd throw you in
jail for that." “That equals riding the buswith a

beard and a peace button; or riding the bus in a
black skin with a white girl (something you re go-
ing to be arrested for anyways ) 

Such questions ignore the characteristic pos-
sessed by all nations; that of being inhabited by hu-
man beings. One of the dominant characteristics
of Homo Sapiens is the desire to better his environ-
ment. To believe that we don‘t need social change
in America because were much more free than the
Russians is like saying you shouldn’t mind your
room smelling from fish because somebody else
sleeps in a barn full of cow manure. It is obvious
that both situations must be bettered. If we allow
ourselves to fall into the trap of thinking that being
freer than the Russians is being free, or that being
more creative than the Albanians is being creative,
then we can forget about The Great Society. -

No great society measured its perfection rela— '

tive to the imperfection of its neighbors.

Voice From the Ghetto’

  Burn Baby Burn

by RICHARD J. PALAZZI
Contributing Columnist

I'must. admit I have a little
difficulty communicating with my
peers since I came home from
the ghetto. For example. everyone
I talk to can understand the fact
that the Black man has been in-
finitely patient through all the
bullcrap we've been flinging at
him for several hundred years.
But nobody can seem to under-
stand why suddenly Negroes are
burning and looting their own
ghettos. The whole nation. in
fact, becomes surprised and scan-
dalized when such outbreaks
occur? '

Let's take an imaginary walk
through a ghetto. say. one day
after the assassination of Dr.
Martin Luther King, and take a
look at what's happening. The
walk will be very dangerous. to
say the least. We will have to be
invisible. in fact. because if we
are white we may be attacked
and beaten by a group of angry
young Blacks who watched on
television a-s we chased. beat, hos-

shot their leader to death. And
if we are black, we will ‘be chas-
ed by the national guard, bitten
by police dogs, taken to jail. or

perhaps shot by a police officer;
,just for daring to walk down the

street.

AS WE walk along, there seem
to be random patterns of indis-
criminate looting and burning.
But let's take a closer look, and
a definite, purposeful pattern
willappear.

On the left, people are clear-
ing out a three-story apartment
house. They always do that be-
fore they burn a building, not
wanting to harm any of their own
people. The residents of the build-
ing, some old and sick. are pro-
testing this eviction —— but not
‘protesting so vehemently as they
might be. They know that this
issthe only way: they can ever
rid themselves of the rats and
roaches and dirty peeling paint
and rusty broken plumbing that

remain inside the building, o,wn-*

ed by a wealthy slumlord. ‘ ‘
Next door is the grocery store

have died from bad meat. or
make up for the outrageous pric-
es they have been paying for
years and years?‘ ’

THERE goes the furniture
store across,_the street; the cheap.
furniture they have always sold at
such high prices burns fast, and

if.‘
(

takes with it the credit recordsi?

of all those people whose wages
are garnished, and of everyone
who is paying twice the suggest-
ed retail value for a television‘
(at 6% interest). 5

I can see a family burning
their own home. That's alright,
thoughjbecause they had just
missed a payment on their mort-
gage "contract”, and they knew
they would be evicted tomorrow
and left with no equity on the
exhorbitant payments they had

been making for fifteen years.

- relations director for the Council for Women's
Rights. Miss Abercrombie doeslnot feel that the
NAACP resolutions made at its recent national
3 convention were given equal coverage when the
 resolutions dealt with the subject of. women's
.s rights.)

by SUSAN M. ABERCROMBIE

The National-Convention of the NAACP, held
in Cincinnati. Ohio. June 28 to July 4, passed a

of equal rights for women. These resolutions cov-
, er internal affairs of the NAACP. civil rights of
 _ women.and programs for working women.

The National Board of Directors was directed
‘ to establish a special national committee to make
 recommendations on how the NAACP "may im-
’ prove its commitment to and ‘practice of equal
 rights for women,“ including "equitable female
«- representation on the Board of Directors.

_ On civil rights of women. the Convention re-
_ solved that the NAACP take action to implement
six specific recommendations:

‘THAT ALL Federal programs, include an
equitable number of women and men in their
staff and in the participants.

“That the Office of Federal Contract Compli-
ance guidelines on sex discrimination be expand-
- ed to include goals and timetables.“ These guide-
lines. effective June 9. 1970, unlike the earlier
guidelines relating to racial discrimination, do
jgnotiinclude any specific goals for the employment
of women by federal contractors. nor do they
 give any timetables or- time limits for theachieve-
j: ’ ment of equality of opportunity for women.

“That, Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964

The Convention noted that many women must
work in order to support themselves and their fam-
ilies, and that ‘,‘industry IS not utilizing Woman
Power to its’ maximum extent in employment."
It urged labor, industry. and the Federal Govern-
ment to work collectively and, or separately to pro-
vide day care ‘centers with quality educational
facilities for the children of working mothers and
widowed fathers: and to establish training pro-
grams and secure employment for unemployed
mothers who wish to work.’

This release is being issued because. while
the NAACP National Convention was covered in
considerable detail..the resolutions with regard
to women have been completely ignored‘by the
news media.

SAGA Services Attacked Again

Dear Editor, The Pitt News:

This letter is a rebuttal to the employee of
Saga food who defended her glorious boss and re-
ceived her well earned raise.

I am one of those people she referred to as a
“dorm rat" and I‘d like to let her in on my side

I must admit that at first glance the Saga
cafeterias (especially the Towers cafes) are very
impressive; they have _an abundance of choices,
the places are clean and orderly, the workers
wear sanitary gloves.

But, after living in the dorms for two years,
I've found that the Towers cafes to be the most
disgusting places to eat.

First of all, if the peaceful looking checkers
let you through the door, you’re lucky; these ea-

gle eyes caused one of my ‘friends’ meal tickets

to be confiscated even though she paid for it and
did not miss use it; could she help it if Saga gave
out two meal tickets with the same number?

Secondly, the service really has hit an all
time low; these charming angels in blue slop the
food on plates as though it were drek_ (Gr. for
dirt) and shove it to the “dorm rats” who meekly
pick up these messy plates and walk away.

Thirdly, this appetizing food really is dirt:
freshman year (68-69). the main food was beef,
either in the form of hamburger, el rancheros
(hamburger), salisbury steak (hamburger), or
ground beef steak (hamburger), or tough roast
beef, or g“steak" on Saturday; sophomore year
(69-70), the main food was breaded veal saturated

in grease, (4 nights a week). or what they refer
to as veal parmageon (greasey breaded veal with
cheese in tomato sauce) two nights a week and
"steak on Saturday. '

Besides that, the vegetables were hard as pet-
rified wood (the broccoli) or mushy as the week
old mixed vegetables.

I gave up on the potatoes.

The lunches are also terrible: two slices of
stale bread with BLT that fits on half of one
slice; "hot" beef sandwiches on stale bread with
tough cold beef and ice cold gravy; pizza that has
to be eaten with a fork.

Fourth, in order to get this “food” the “dorm
rats” have to wait in a 40 foot line and it isn’t
too frustrating to walk around Tower’ A and C
‘cafes with a heavy tray and not find one seat!

I would also like to defend all these "rats" for
"stealing” food from the cafe. Deviance is in the
eye of the beholder:

I paid to eat there, rather I was forced to pay
for food which I knew I wouldn’t eat (breakfast)
and if I felt like taking sugar, butter, bread. or
fruit out of the cafe, I felt justified because I
paid for many meals which I did not eat.

I am not trying to say that this “angel" in
‘blue is wrong; her bosses are wrong in the way
they organize and carry out their business.

I also have to state that I along with many
other “dorm rats" have decided to move out of
these over priced dorms and into. apartments
where we can live cheaply and eat real food.

Can You Create Life
    Knowing That...?)

Dear Editor, The Pitt News :‘

Our cities are strangling. Our
wilderness is vanishing. Our
children are starving. Our time is
running out. ,

‘ “It is hard to suppose that pen-
ultimate Western man, stalled in.
the ultimate traffic jam and slow-
ly succumbingto carbon monox-
ide, will be especially enchanted
to hear from the last survivor
that in the preceding year Gross
National Product went up by a

, record amount,” sayd John Ken-
A neth Galbreathf. ‘

Think of our cities today and
what comes to mind? One enor-

'. mous traffic jam. Could this be a

sign of the population explosion?
Many millions of people are go-
ing to starve to death before our
eyes.

“We shall be surrounded by a

A Evening: 441-

Editor, Pitt News:

At 12:05 P.M. July 13, 1970
a teletype message was received
in Pittsburgh to the district of-
fice of the Internal Revenue Ser-
vices’ Alcohol, Tobacco and Fire-
arms Division. The message per-
mitted agents to search through
public libraries for persons bor-
rowing books concerning the
manufacture of liquor, or books
on explosives. The message in
full is of public record; but here
I wish to comment on it.

The document permitted agents
finding persons ‘borrowing those
books to regard such persons sus-
pect of violating Federal laws.
But what law, right, or statute
prevents other agencies of the
government from PROBING

Campus, Security Praised

Attention Captain Ray.
Dear Sir,

I would like to commend the U

TIOW.

It seems he had been keeping an eye on three suspicious-looking’
characters, one of whom decided to leave on my motorcycle! Being sus .
picious of the hasty exit, and recognizing the other two about to drive?
away, he stopped them and obtained addresses from their drivers?" li-.

- censes. When I reported my motorcycle stolen Officer Rapp's susp ;,

cions were confirmed.

. Since the dirty crooks hadn‘t gotten away clean. they abandoned;
the bike and I found it the next day. If it hadn’t been for Officer Rapp,’s—
fast action I'd be crying in my beer, as my life savings were in the bike. '

Hats off also to the efficiency and help given by Officers Graham.

Green, Delaney, and the Sergeant.

"coaches at Pitt, is’ given a budget

fit. This past season aid was
awarded to the top two players on
the team, Tom Stromp.and Joel

Webster sites his newnessto Pitt
as one of the major reasons for

‘Now, with a year behind‘ him,
the- coach can-and should—be
familiar enough to spread the
wealth where it is deserved. '

C McKee wants indoor courts for
off—seasoii and bad weather prac-
ticing. So does Myslinski. “So does
Webster. Suchcourts are in Pitt's
long—range ‘plans. Finances, delay’
their existence. but Webster’ ex-
,pect,s' to rent indoor space "in the
near_fut'ure.“ “ V . ’ t
0 McKee thinks that; ‘rackets
shouldbe ‘supplied by the athletic.
department. This could be policy
in the future. Webster explains
that h_e takes care of “reason: ‘
able breaks,-and Myslinski thinks’
: that it would be a good idea to pro-
vide rackets for players who re-
quire them. He stipulates, though,

during the season’.,”. ‘Can _ one

‘ blame the AD_ for not wanting to

give free rackets to anyone who

for everything that they favor. In
Webster's first year, the squad
compiled a 4-10 record, compar-
ed to an 0-13 mark under Ben Pope
last spring. One would have to call
this seasona successful one. . A
‘ Most of the tennis. players were i.

in their first season of play for

Pitt, though._ and didn't realize , "

the extent of the problems before
Webste_r’s arrival.

One argument the players have
against Webster is that he is bas- J
ketball coach first,‘ tennis coach
second. Whether that’s true or not ~
isn’t' important if Webster -can .-
handle the tennis assignment. -And
Webster’ is seeking the best high
