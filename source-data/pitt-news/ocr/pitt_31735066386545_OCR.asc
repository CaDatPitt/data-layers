Alex -Haley took Pitt students and guests
down memory lane last night with a behind-
the-scenes look at how his best-selling book,

Roots, came into being.

Haley, who was born in a small town called
Henning, Tenn. and raised by his grandparents
while both his parents spent a fair amount of
time away from the home to fulfill their
teaching careers, recalled a time when he sat
on the porch with his grandmother and her

sisters listening to them reminisce.

“After they talked about themselves and

Haley said they would sit around and talk
about such people as their father’s father,
“Chicken George,” who they described as

scandalous and a womanizer.

“And they talked night after night, and I
listened night after night. And that was how
I began to ingest and learn just from hearing
the stories, the stories that were never told in
exactly the same words any night, but was

just like a loose of stories that ﬂoated from I

“And at the same time, I was picking up F
another set of stories. Henning, Tenn. was a
little Bible—ﬁlled Protestant town. Children all
went to Sunday school, and in Sunday school
we all learned biblical passages, so that by
the time I guess I was around the age of 11
or so, my head was full of stories like David

were all mixed up in there,” Haley said.
When college didn’t work out for Haley,
and his father ﬁgured that he needed to

Last January Pitt began a
pilot recycling program that
ran through the spring to
see what problems might
arise‘. According to Young,
the mock program went
rather smoothly.

Chris Weinstein, facilities
manager for Forbes Quad,
said, “In the jurisdiction of
facilities management, the
program will be phased into
more buildings over the
next four to six months.”

According to state law,
the commercial and
institutional organizations
of the city of Pittsburgh are
required to recycle the
following: high-grade office

I Continued from page 1
Haley said his father didn’t realize
that he was doing him the ultimate
favor because there was no
comparison between being a
student on a campus and being a
“fancy-free sailor.”

“A few sailors would come
around to me in a very covert
way and ask me if I would help
them write a letter to a girl. I
thought it would be kind of fun,
so I said that I would, ” said Haley.
“I would sit at a little mess table
with my 3-by-S index cards, and
my clients would literally line up.
I would interview them and say,
‘OK, what’s her name, and what
does she look like, and is there
anything that you would like
special for me to say?”’

Haley said the next morning,
when there were no dishes to
wash in the galley, he would
collect all of his information and
create some kind of creative
details to match the woman’s
characteristics. For example, if
one of the sailors told Haley that
his girlfriend had blonde hair,

Haley said he would write

something such as, her hair was
like the color of the moon
shimmering on the ocean. Later,
he was paid $1 for each of his
letters.

“I was heroic, literally heroic.
But, that was how I first got the
thought that writing might be
something for me to fiddle around
with. I then got the idea to write
stories and send them to
magazines,” said Haley.

Later, Haley began writing
articles for Readers Digest and
Playboy magazines. Playboy
allowed him to do feature stories
about inspirational role models,
such as Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
and Malcolm X.

“I did an interview on Malcolm
in Playboy and the publishing
editor read it, and he asked
Malcolm if he would be willing to
tell his life story in fuller detail.
Malcolm then asked me if I would
write the book. I was pleased,
honored and ﬂattered,” said
Haley.

Long-running Slade play performed at PPC’ dinner-theater

By Tammy Poole
Staﬁ“ W1-iter

Tuesday evening marked the
third consecutive year that the
Repertory Theater of America/
Alpha—Omega Players have
performed at the University of
Pittsburgh.

During a dinner-theater event
organized by the art committee
of the Pitt Program Council, the
AOP entertained Pitt students and
guests with a Bernard Slade
production of Same Time, Next
Year. The performers, one of three
separate touring units, consisted
of Meg McNu1ty, who played

Doris, Nathan Thomas, who
played George, and Dennis Smith,
an understudy, who played a
character by the name of Chalmer,
who served as an interrnittence
between scenes.

“When I first got the part, I was
like ‘Yeah, wow  I'm real
enthusiastic about this — a walk-
on part. Yeah,’” said Smith, while
twirling an index finger in the air.
“But I’ve been in several cases
where, after my second scene
change, there was applause every
time I came on stage. And then in
the ﬁnal scene, when Chalmer
has actually aged 25 years, there
is this major, major applause.

“It makes me believe that there
is no part too small. And I just
love that applause," Smith said,
while embracing himself.
“Especially when it is my own
private applause.”

Smith said an audience’s
response to a show plays a very
important part in sustaining an
actor’s momentum, especially
when a play is long-nrnning, such
as Same Time, Next Year, which
has just completed its 22nd
performance.

“I think the audience has a lot
to do with an actor’s motivation.
If your audience is very receptive,
then you do have a certain amount

of energy that flows whenever
you do a show. We have two
other shows to perform as well,
so you kind of get away from the
play long enough that when you
do it again, it is a new experience
and not the same show over and
over again,” said Smith

The one thing that McNulty
holds dear to her heart is the
dream to establish herself as an
actress and star on television and
in movies.

“Right now, I would love to go
back to Chicago and make a
name for myself and then branch
out to lLos Angeles] or New York,
where I can get work. I would

also love to be able to support
myself in my craft. That is my
immediate dream, ” said McNulty.
“It's really hard in acting to be
able to just act and make enough
money to live."

McNulty said the way to make
it in the acting profession is to
develop an image that is widely
recognized by viewers.

“When I was out in L.A. a
couple of summers ago, I was
talking to some actors who said
that the best thing you can do

how you are perceived by
directors and teachers and

How important is security?

When students request housing at the University of
Pittsburgh, they do so to have a sense of security. Students
who live in Lothrop Hall, however, are finding that their
security is not very tight. ..

On Monday night, a master key for the dormitory was
discovered to be missing. Since then, at least two residents
on the seventh ﬂoor have discovered that their rooms
were broken into. As well, one of those students said that
after reporting the break-in to the police, an RA told her
that rooms on the third and sixth ﬂoors had also been
robbed. .

Students in Lothrop Hall were advised to keep their
radios on when they leave their rooms to discourage any

possible burglars.

Radio, while a good form of communication and
entertainment, is not a sufficient method of security.
Students should not have to rely on this as their only
means of warding off potential threats to themselves and
to their valuables.

This ridiculous attempt to keep students safe while
police locate the missing master key is a poor substitute
for secure campus housing. ‘

Even more negligent was the fact that resident assistants
were told by a member of the campus police not to tell
students about the missing key in an attempt to keep so-
called “panic” to a minimum. As a result, many Lothrop
residents did not know about this situation until yesterday.

As a member of the public safety department, this officer
should know the importance of informing the public
about possible security threats. Yet he told the people not
to inform the residents of a building that a master key was
missing and possibly stolen. This not only increases the
worries of the residents but the workload of public safety
as well, because now someone has to patrol the areas in
question. _

Housing administrator Mary Cacali said that this
information was withheld to prevent a panic. A panic?
Hardly. At best, the students would have been more
careful. What can be expected though, from an
administrator who says that the recent thefts and the
missing key aren't related?

Unfortunately, robbery is not the most serious crime
committed on‘ this campus. Assault, rape and murder,
while not commonplace, are always a possibility. Although
students have now been warned, there is no reason to
assume that these crimes are completely out of the realm
of possibility in the dorms.

Students need to keep their minds on personal security. ~

But, if the residents of Pitt’s community are not told about
threats to their security, then there is no way that they can
adequately defend themselves against crime.

Civil Rights Bill veto necessary

Three cheers for President
Bush. A few weeks ago he vetoed
a bill that contained the words
“civil rights,” but those two words
weren’t used in the traditional
sense in this case. The veto of the
Civil Rights Bill of 1990 was a
necessary but politically
dangerous action.

The Civil Rights Bill of 1990
would have overturned six
Supreme Court decisions handed
down last year concerning job
bias. This bill was proposed by
that perennial special-interest-
group ﬂunky, Sen. Ted Kennedy
(D-Mass). Sen. Kennedy has
always catered to every whim of
minority special interest groups,
and this bill is typical of his
senseless far-left ideology. I can
only hope that someday
Massachusetts voters will remove
him from office.

What this bill would have done
is to make it practically impossible
for businesses to defend
themselves against discrimination
suits by minorities and women. It
also hiked the maximum amount
of money that could be won in a
lawsuit to $150,000. You don’t
have to possess a Ph.D to figure
out what businesses would have
done had the bill been passed.
Business reaction would be
something that the vast majority
of Americans will not tolerate:
job quotas. Of course every
minority group in this country
denounced Bush’s veto, even
though I doubt they considered
the ramifications of such a bill if
passed. In fact, this bill stood a
good chance of increasing racism
because white Americans are
beginning to resent affirmative-
action programs and to perceive
minorities as being babied. This
notion may be faulty but is
nevertheless present, as
evidenced by the near-election
of ex-Ku Klux Klan member David
Duke in Louisiana.

One thing that isn't mentioned
by opponents of Bush’s veto is
the fact that a compromise bill
was drafted by the White House

that would have lessened the
chance of job quotas, but the
Democrats in Congress would
have nothing to do with it. The
Civil Rights Bill of 1990 wasin
part _a political move by the
Democrats, considering a major
portion of Democratic voters are

. minorities, and elections were

near. Some misguided people
have suggested that the
presidential veto was a ploy to
gain the support of more white
voters. This is obviously ridiculous
because the Republican Party has
enjoyed increasing minority
support in recent elections.
Another name for this bill could
have been the Lawyer Bonanza
Bill of 1990. So many lawsuits
would have been filed —— most

Gary
Houston

probably unjustiﬁed — after this
bill became law that lawyers
would have been positively giddy
with anticipation. Lawyers would
get richer, and businesses would
simply institute job quotas to
combat lawsuits. Hiring should
be done on the basis of merit and
qualification. Hiring should not
be done by race in order to avoid
potential lawsuits. I believe that
in today's competitive world,
employers want the most
qualified people, regardless of
race. In short, it wouldn't be
good business sense. ,

A good example of the
obsolescence of some affirmative-
action programs is evident here
in Pittsburgh. In the middle ’70s
a federal judge decreed that for
every four people hired as police
officers, there was to be one
white man, one white woman,
one black man, and one black
woman. This court order was
supposed to remedy the lack of
minority police officers. Now, this
may have been necessary for a

few years to eliminate any
disparity, "but ' is this order
necessary now? A few months

ago two white men filed suit .

against the city because they were
passed over in the hiring process
in favor of two black men, even
though the white men’s scores
on the civil—service exam were
far superior. If the situation were
reversed, every minority group
in this country would - be
screaming for blood. Why should
there be a double standard?
Minorities are justified in seeking
equality, but why should reverse
discrimination be overlooked?

Affirmative-action laws and
penalties would become much
more numerous if the Civil Rights
Bill of 1990 were passed.
Democrats are relying on statistics
to justify their claims of
widespread discrimination in the
workplace. Simple statistics are
much too ﬂimsy to be used to
determine possible discrimination
because they ignore many other
factors such‘ as the makeup of the
population surrounding the
business.

I believe President Bush’s veto
was a good decision. I’m glad to
see that someone can stand up to
the sometimes ridiculous
demands of the very vocal
minority special—interest groups
that populate the political scene.
It saddens me to think that more
liberal Democrats will probably
be elected to Congress this month,
considering the illogical nature
of their reasoning, of which this
bill is a prime example. The Civil
Rights Bill of 1990 would have
distorted the meaning of the
words “civil rights.” It's depressing
to see that in today's day and age,
the words “equal opportunity”
are beginning to stand for
preferential treatment. Civil rights
are a good thing, but not when
the rights of a small segment of
society take precedence over and
infringe upon the rights of
everybody else.

According to Harris, recent
improvements in East/West
relations have also contributed
to the Soviet reaction.

“The relationship between
the United States and the Soviet
Union has been transformed
from a confrontational
relationship to one of

partnership and collab-
oration,” Harris said.

But he also said that this
trend was not brought about
solely by current Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev.
“Even though they saw Ronald
Reagan as a monster, the
policies of greater collabor-
ation between the two
countries began before
Gorbachev,” he said.

relaxing and entertaining.

“It’s a pretty good play and also
very funny. I saw the movie and

Cantor.

Julia Dopirak, a first-year stu-

THE PITI‘ NEWS, Thursday, November 15, 1990

 

Continued from page 1
the first things that Pitt will be
recycling are paper and
aluminum. Weinstein said that 40
more receptacles will be placed
in Forbes Quad. There will be
receptacles for aluminum and

“paper.

In the paper receptacles only
the following are acceptable:
white and colored papers; white
and colored envelopes with or

 

without windows; booklets and
manuals (without the shiny-
looking milar coating); greeting
cards; manilla and colored folders;
NCR and carbonless forms; soft-
colored books with white pages;
fax, telefax, and copy paper; tab
and time cards; self-adhesive
notes and envelopes; and adding
machine tape, according to
information from Browning—Ferris
Industries.

According to Karen Gierescher,
the Pittsburgh district recycling
coordinator for BFI Waste
Systems, “It is important that
people only place in the
containers what is permitted. If
people contaminate the
receptacle with a non—recyc1able
item, the BFI recycling truck
cannot take it. The university will
then have to pay for an ordinary
waste—disposal truck to come and

dispose of it. Therefore, it will
only cost the university money if
the rules are not followed."
Gierescher said, “The intent of
Act 101 was to reduce the amount
going into the landfills, and
recycling is the means by which
we can do this. Pennsylvania has
77 landﬁlls currently open, but
but by 1995 half of those will be
closed [according to projected
statistics]. The price of disposing

will rise phenomenally.”

The program in Forbes Quad
will consist of regular garbage
being picked up on Mondays,
Wednesdays and Fridays, and
recyclable trash being picked up
on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

There will be a meeting to
discuss any questions about the
recycling program on Friday at
11:15 a.m. in Room IKS6 Forbes
Quad.

Pitt hoops tries talent against team from D

By Derek Willis
Staﬂ Writer

The Pitt basketball team plays
its second and final exhibition
tonight at 8 p.m., when the
Melbourne Tigers visit Fitzgerald
Field House. The Tigers are a
touring Australian team coached
by Lindsay Gaze. If the name
sounds familiar, then you’ll
remember a certain fellow named
Andrew Gaze, who helped Seton
Hall to the NCAA tournament
championship two years ago.
Lindsay is Andrew’s father, and
just to make it a real family affair,
Andrew’s older brother Mark is a
guard for the Tigers. The youngest
Gaze will help his father on the
sidelines tonight; a blood clot in
Andrew’s shoulder will keep him
out of action.

The rest of the lineup is even
more unfamiliar than the
Marathon Oil roster, although the
Tigers do sport three Americans.
David Colbert, a 6-foot—8—inch
forward, played at the University
of Dayton and was recruited to
the Aussie team after playing in
the Continental Basketball
Association. Colbert is also one
of the team's top scorers and
rebounders and can shoot inside
or outside.

Another American is center
David Simmons, from Oklahoma
City University. Simmons is an
aggressive player prone to
fouling. The third player from the
States is Brad Pineau, a backup
center who hails from Hawaii.

With the exception of those
three and 29-year-old Mark Gaze,
who has eight years of
international experience, the rest

of the team is young, ranging in
age from 18 to 24 years. Most of
the players come from the
Australian junior national team
and have represented their
country in international play at
that level. Among the most
exciting is 6-foot-6-inch guard
Stephen Whitehead, an all-
purpose type who looks to have
a bright future —— one which
could include a stop at an
American college. Warrick

Giddey, a 22-year-old forward,

has participated in three sports at
the international level: basketball,

rugby and swimming.

Two of the younger players,
guard Dean Vickerman and
center Nick Tenner, are among
the finest junior national players
in Australia and are hoping to
make the senior national team
this year. Such is the case for Ray
Gordon, a 6-foot-3-inch guard,
and 6—foot-6-inch swingman
Nigel Purchase.

Melbourne is a high—scoring
team which excels in the areas of
perimeter scoring and transition
play. The Tigers have a successful
tradition in their country, having

reached the ﬁnals of the Australian
championships 36 out of 57 times,
but they have lost in the finals the
last two years after injuries to key
players. Coach Gaze is a veteran
of international play, having
played in three Olympic Games
and coached in four more.

In preparing for the game, Pitt
Coach Paul Evans plans to use
the same game plan that he used
in the game with Marathon Oil.
“We’re going to apply a lot of

.pI‘€SS11I'C and COflC€l'1[I'3[€ on.

defense,” Evans said, “and we’ll
try and play everyone, like we

did in the first game.” Evans also
plans to unveil some new player
combinations
successful in the team’s intra-
squad game last Saturday.

Pitt tennis players eliminated in first round of tournament  

By Kenn Gaither
Staﬁ‘ Writer

Despite two losses in two matches, Pitt tennis
players Terence Rosenthal and Jeff Mills went
down fighting at the ITCA Rolex Tennis
Championships held last weekend at Princeton
University.

The ITCA Championships represent the strongest
Division I teams in the East, such as Princeton,
West Virginia and Harvard. Eight other similar
competitions were held at the same time nationwide
in other regions.

“This was the cream of the crop of the East and
a great opportunity for us,” according to Pitt men’s
tennis coach George Dieffenbach.

Rosenthal, the No. 1 seed for Pitt, lost to Mike
Hughes of Boston College 6-0, 6-3, in the first
round.

“Hughes played an exceptional first set, and this
made Terence ’s second set better,” said Dieffenbach.

A strong second set by Rosenthal was still not
enough to defeat Hughes, who also reached the

finals of the Big East Championship this year in
September in Weekapang, R.I.

“It was a hard court, making the ball bounce
higher than I was expecting, and Hughes just
played phenomenally,” Rosenthal said.

Rosenthal was joined by Jeff Mills to represent
Pitt’s best doubles team. In first—round action they
faced Mount St. Mary’s College. A

In a‘ tough game that lasted three hours and 15
minutes, Pitt lost a closer match, 4-6, 6-4, 6-4.

Rosenthal blamed the loss on a few bad bounces
and thought they should have won.

“It was a game that could have gone either way,”
Dieffenbach added of the heart-wrenching doubles
defeat.

Despite the two losses, Dieffenbach praised his
two players. “They played their best and gave 110
percent.”

The two losses also could not sour a successful
season for the entire team. Pitt finished at 3-1.

The team resumes action on the court in February
1991 at the Pitt Invitational in the Cost Center.

Homgm’ tough: Pens sticking it to opponents on the road

Strange things are going on in Pittsburgh.
The once thought coachless Pittsburgh

‘ Penguins are actually playing defense and

are winning on the road. Last Night in
Winnipeg, behind Phil B0rque’s two goals,
then Pens knocked off the newly
uniformed Jets, 6-4. The Pens have now
allowed only 11 goals in their past four
games but more importantly, they are 7-2-
1 in their last 10 outings.

Coach Bobjohnson has the team playing
with Confidence and winning with defense.
Sure, the Pens are still getting outshot, but
rebound goals and stupid penalties aren't
as common. Johnson has to deserve a lot

- of credit, but so does the goaltending.

T om Barasso appears to be back for the
time being and Frank Pietrangelo played
spectacular in goal Tuesday night in

Minnesota in the teams 4-1 triumph.

On the subject of hot goalies, the Pens
got stonewalled by Curtis Joseph of the
Blues and Andy Moog of the Bruins, who
held the Pens’ high powered attack to only
five goals and only one point in those two

Some other thoughts from around the
N.H.L.:

The Norris Division's Chicago
Blackhawks and St. Louis Blues are ranked
one and two respectively in goals against
and are doing it in fine Norris division style
with tight

games. But the Pens
recovered from last
weeks door slam-

Brian Berger

forechecking and
strong goaltending.

rning and now own
a lO—7~2 mark on the season with a very
impressive 5-3-2 record on the road where
they never used to come home with
points.

The season has got a long way to go but
some encouraging habits in the Penguins’
defensive end are starting to crop up and
the light at the top of the parity-ridden
Patrick division is visible.

In the windy city,
goalie Eddie Belfour is the backbone
behind the Hawks success. He leads the
N.H.L. with 11 wins and an astounding
1.88 goals against average. Coach Mike
Keenan has always said if the Hawks get
consistent net play they can beat anyone.
Think the addition of Chris Chelios has
helped much?

One team that the Blackhawks might

not be able to handle is the St.Louis Blues,

who lead the Norris with 27 points and an I

impressive 7-3 road record. Goaltender
Vincent Riendeau is 8-2-1 and backup
Curtis Joseph has looked sharp every time
out and owns an admirable 2.75 goals
against in 6 starts. Oh yeah, the Blues also
have Brett Hull who leads the league with

19 goals and is the best scorer in the game ,
today, bar none. The elite in the Norris are I

no longer just prey for the Smythe
champions to trounce in the playoffs. This
is for real.

How well has the Patrick Division been
playing? Well, five teams have a record
above .500 and the always-tough—on-the-
road Stanley Cup favorite Calgary Flames
just completed a wonderful 1-2-1 stint
through the division.

The Sporting News (9th). A

Evans didn’t say that the
preseason hype affected his
Panthers’ play last year, but he
has lectured the team on the
dangers of it happening this year.

“It may or may not happen.
Maybe they’ve gotten used to
losing after last year. I don’t think
that's the case, but you never
know,” said Evans. That
philosophy is won on at least one
of Evans’ pupils.

“I'm not going to predict
anything,” said Miller. “That’s not
good for the team. We do have a
lot of talent, experience and
depth, but realistically anything
could happen. I think we have a
good chance to be up there, but

you can have a team come out of
nowhere again, like Connecticut
did last year.”

The fact that the demons in
Blanche DuBois’ closet chase her
to Elysian Fields isn’t really subject
to interpretation.

But in Tracy Ginder-
De1venthal’s interpretation of
Tennessee Williams’ A Streetcar
Named Desire, those demons (or
“ghoulies” as she refers to them)
don costumes and take their
places on stage as cast members.

This is one of several departures
taken by director Ginder-
Delventhal in her first production
for Pitt theater.

She has dropped the inﬂuence
of the sweltering New Orleans
setting upon the progression of
Blanche’s mental deterioration.

couldn’t be confused with Marlon
Brando in even the darkest of
alleys.

She has stripped away the
romance with which this
production is traditionally
portrayed and taken instead a
directly psychological approach.

In the transition the play has
lost its sexuality, its energy and a
lot of its character.

Sexual tension, traditionally
Streetcar’s raison d’etre, is
virtually non—existent in this
production.

The big scene, when Stanley
finally takes Blanche up on her
advances, is actually anti-
climactic; Blanche’s surrender is
totally devoid of passion.

downfall.

passion is key. Its lack is,
unfortunately, this production’s
most notable feature.

Sara Jane” Fleming displays a
great deal of craft with her
portrayal of Blanche. (She really
has a handle on the Southern
belle bit.) Her interaction with
Mitch (played by Jeffrey
DeVincent) is exceptional.

DeVincent’s appearances on
stage are a much-appreciated
source of energy and emotion.

Jenny Noa portrays Stella with
utter passivity. Apart from the
vague pleasure she appears to
derive from near—constant sex
with her boorish husband and an
occasional outbreak of
compassion for her sister, Stella
seems to feel nothing but
boredom. ‘

The second most memorable
feature of Pitt theater's Streetcar
is the completely gray and highly
mobile set. If nothing else, Stella
and Stanley's ever-shifting home
provides some enlightenment on
Blanche’s disorientation.

A Streetcar Named Desire will

  Metropolitan’ a

By Dmitri Ragano

Showcase Editor

Like fellow New Yorkers
Woody Allen and Spike Lee,
filmmaker Whit Stillman writes
about relationships among
members of specific ethnic/
economic/Cultural slices of the
Apple. In Metropolitan Stillman
deals with an America most of us
will never see: the elite whitebread
social circles of Park Avenue.

The film claims its characters
are from a “doomed class” —
sons and daughters of America's
ruling families which are slowly
losing their wealth to the nouveau
riche. These young men and
women of Metropolitan wear
gowns and tuxedos for debutante
parties and attend all the best
schools. 'Ihey’re the same people
immortalized in F. Scott
Fitzgerald’s books, butunlike their
counterparts of the ’20s, their
lifestyles seem watered down,
harmless. (Fittingly, Metropolitan
is like a Fitzgerald story made
harmless.)

The film starts with the
handsome Tom (Edward
Clements) entering a Park Avenue
clique whose members include
Audrey, Nick, Charlie and Jane,

,.who plays hostess to their nightly

Doomed young socialites gather to Whine and dine in Whit Stil1ma.n's debut film ‘Metropolitan.’

parties. Tom is an outsider to this
crowd. First off, he’s from the
West Side. Also, his head’s full of
strange (though shallow) socialist
ideas that make him object to
these parties in the first place.
Nick takes Tom under his wing
and convinces him to keep
attending the parties.

Tom quickly finds himself in
the midst of a love triangle.

own secret admirer —- the nice,

Tom and Audrey spend most
of their time discussing books.
Tom has opinions on all of
Audrey’s favorite authors, even
though he hasn’t read them. He
says he prefers literary criticism
to literature itself. As a friend
pointed out to me, T om’s Cliffs-
Notes knowledge of literature is
a perfect metaphor for these
people — they live their lives
based on other people’s insights
and recommendations. Tom, for
instance, is opposed to debutante
parties but goes to them anyway.

Tom and Audrey’s romance

may get a little cutesy, but what _

really pushes Metropolitan over
the top — what makes itiworth
seeing — is Eigeman’s portrayal
of Nick, the cynic of the bunch.
Sly, self-satisfied, self—parodying,
he’s the kind of guy who brings
lightness to situations just by being
there.

Nick has a hatred for the clique’s
notorious Casanova, Rick von
Slaneker. In one scene, Nick asks

Rick about his collection of old

before getting a bloody nose.

Nick adds the acerbic element
this film needs. When he’s gone,
the rest of these sheltered

fear they would in real life. Nick
exits before the film’s ending.
Consequently, the ending’s not

We’ 11 leave you reeling

Child's Play 2

By Donna Terrell
Sta_[f Writer

Thinking about seeing Cbz'ld’5 Play2? Expecting
to sit in the theater, feet tapping nervously,
watching the movie with your hand over your right
eye? Forget it.

Yes Jack, you will be very sorry Chucky is back.
The sequel to the 1988 thriller Cbz'ld’sPlay, featuring
a murderous doll named Chucky, fails to create the
suspenseful atmosphere that left audiences terrified
and entertained in the original.

The first question that comes to mind is: How the
hell does a doll that was burnt beyond recognition
come back to life? Easy. The manufacturer and
distributor of the Good Guy dolls both want
Chucky reassembled and good as new for pub-
licity purposes and to appease angry stockholders.
Couldn’t they just show the press and the
stockholders a different Good Guys doll? After all,
they all look alike. Well, you know as well as I do

that Satan works in mysterious ways. The head of
the company demands that Chucky be reassembled,
and he is.

Following the death of the two workers assigned
to put Chucky back together again, a big shot at the
company decides that there is only one safe place
for the doll — the back seat of his car. Luckily for
Chucky, the car has a phone, which Chucky uses
to find the whereabouts of Andy Barclay while the
owner of the car is in the state store. Chucky has
a copy of the file from the foster—care agency where
Andy has been living since his _ mother’s
hospitalization. How convenient!

He learns that Andy has been placed in the care
of a foster family named the Simpsons. He kills the
unsuspecting executive, then proceeds with his
plan to possess Andy’s body.

Chucky spends the remainder of the movie
pursuing Andy, while Andy tries to convince the
Simpsons that Chucky is after his soul. Andy does
find one ally. Kyle, a young woman also placed
with the Simpsons, likes Andy, but she doesn’t
believe his story until it is too late. Chucky kills Mr.
Simpson, and Andy is carted back to the foster
home.

During the ﬁnal scene, which takes place in the
toy factory where Chucky was born, Chucky finally
corners Andy and performs his demonic ritual.

I know there are some folks out there who still
want to see the movie, so I won’t tell how the movie
ends, but remember you had a fair warning.

Producers attempted to make Chucky funnier
and scarier. He is funnier and relentless, but not as
scary as in the original Cbz'ld’5 Play. We see too
much of Chucky. He is so wrapped up in delivering
his one—liners, that he forgets to be scary. We have
to settle for his foul-mouthed humor and predictable
murder scenes.

Spirituality #99 otor local bcmd

By Stacy Lebowitz
For the Pitt News

We sat in near darkness. The
only source of light came from a
ﬂaming candle in the center of
the circle, symbolic of Rusted
Root’s burning desire for political,
spiritual and musical balance.

Rusted Root has been heavily
affected by political and social
issues. It has played for a ‘ct of
benefits, including Earth Day ’90.
It helped organize a benefit to
help stop the destruction of the
rain forests. Whenever the band
plays, it invites action groups to
set up booths to help it spread
awareness.

“The majority just don’t know
what’s going on,” says drummer
Jim Donovan. One of the band’s
major goals is to propagate
political awareness by direct
action. Rusted Root doesn’t just
say it supports a cause; it goes out
and does it the best way it knows
how.

In fact, in 1987 Michael Glabicki,
the founder of the band, went to
Nicaragua to see for himself what
was actually taking place. “At the
same time as . the political
revolution, there was the cultural
revolution. Poetry was being read
on street corners. It was real alive

Local folksters Rusted Root.

with creative energy, which
started getting me aware of that
type of energy you see now in
the band.” He saw 16- and 17-
year-old soldiers carrying “a gun
over one shoulder and a guitar
over the other.” When he came
back to the United States, he
started writing music.

But the songs aren’t written
with a speciﬁc purpose in mind.
Glabicki stresses, “We don’t set
out a song to talk about the rain
forests. It just all comes up, and
you can take the lyrics several
different ways, but they’re very
uplifting."

Percussionist and vocalist Jenn
Wertz adds, “We’re all pretty much
spiritually aware people, and our
music tends to make you more
spiritually aware.”

With its tribal rhythms and
cultural sound, Rusted Root takes
you deep within your soul to the

very roots of your being. The music ‘I

Clinton, a former schoolteacher,

entered the world of comedy in

the late '70s after taking a leave of
absence from teaching to attend
the Writers Center in Cazenovia,

N.Y. During this period some of

these “radical lesbians” would go

out to nursing homes to do
readings. At one point a woman
yelled out, “Perk itup, honey!" So
she started to write narratives
about elderly women taking over
computers at Disney World and

to laugh, sol thought about doing

Clinton recalls attending aseries
of Catholic schools from 1952-69
(Our Lady of Psychological
Warfare).

At a recent performance in
Washington, D.C., Clinton talked
about “straightening” up her
apartment when her mother
visited. Then after she came out
of the closet, she would “dyken
up” her apartment by leaving
lesbian erotica out for her mother
to see. “She would sit down at the
table and say, ‘Oh, what’s this ...’”

Clinton will appear Saturday,

sponsoring three of the hippest
bands touring on the college
circuit: the Vivians, Azalia Snail
and headliners Unsane at 7 p.m.
on Monday, Nov. 19 at the William
Pitt Union Assembly Room.

“The Vivians are a godhead
quad from Cleveland featuring
the ripping vocals of Diane
Duncan, the riveting metallic
guitar of Michelle Temple, the
booming bass of Rae Martello,
the meanest assault-battery drum
 the
Vivians fucking rock ‘n’ roll,” said
WPTS music director Brian
Berger.

“IUnsanel is the loudest,
hardest, meanest, ugliest band of
all time,” said Berger about the
New York City trio that just
released a hot 7-inch on the
Seattle-based label Subpop, titled
“Streetsweeper.”

“Azalia Snail is the mind-
scattering psychedelic offspring
of the Velvet Underground and
Sonic Youth, had those bands

ever copulated,” is how

THE l?l'l'l' NEWS, Thursday, November 15. 1990

By Matthew Myers
Staﬁ" Writer

A With the runaway ﬁnancial
success of this summer's Ghost

I A and the current box-ofﬁce climb

of ]acob’s Ladder, screenwriter
Bruce Joel Rubin is sitting on top
of Hollywood. As the new kid on
Sunset Boulevard, Rubin has
ﬁnally reached a pinnacle of
victory that took 20 years to
achieve and with these big hits,
he will, like Adrian Lyne and Tim
Burton, be given the studio on a
silver platter.

But success has not changed
Bruce Rubin’s personal style; he
just gets to dine at nicer restaurants
without being recognized. A ’60s
product of the NYU ﬁlm school,
Rubin graduated from a new
generation of movie brats that
included good friends Brian
DePalma, Martin Scorsese and
Francis Coppola.

In 1969 Rubin made the
underground ﬁlm Dionysis in '69
with DePalma, and Rubin’s
success seemed certain. But while

DePalma went on to become a
major Hollywood auteur, Rubin
struggled in his Midwest home,
trying to sell screenplay after
screenplay to Tinsel Town. After
working as an editor for NBC
News, Rubin called it quits and
set off for an extensive overland
trip through Europe and Asia.

]acob’s Ladder was voted by
American Film magazine and
many Hollywood producers as
the best unproduced screenplay
in history, but Rubin watched
helplessly as it languished in
unproductive development deals
and on the desks of agents.

Finally, in 1988 Rubin’s reality
went beyond his wildest
aspirations. Not only did he sell
jacobisladder, but the screenplay
for the ﬁlm Gbost manifested
into a colossal blockbuster and
became the top-grossing film of
the summer.

Talking with Bruce is a more
than extraordinary experience,
as I did last week over the phone
from his Northridge house in
Sherman Oaks, Calif. He is not

only passionate and articulate
about his work, but he is also
well-informed about world
cultures and philosophies. Each
of his movies suggests a mind of
incredible energy and dynamic
intensity. All of his ﬁlms deal
with death and the notion that
we must examine ourselves to
truly see what lies in our real
world.

The intense visualization of
life anddeath, particularlythis
sort of “purgatorial limbo” in
bothGhost andIacob’sLadder
seemstoindicatearemarkable
authorship in your work. You
also explore these same
themes in Douglas Trumbull’s
Brainstorm, which you
originallywrote. I am inclined
to argue that you are seriously
preoccupied with the notion
ofdeath.Whatisitabout death
that scares you so much?

(Laughs) A number of people
have said that I was “death
obsessed,” and I really believe

it’s just the opposite —- that it ‘

really is a kind of “life” obsession.
And I really don’t think you can
appreciate the experience of life
unless you somehow face the
reality of its end. I think, in our
society, we deny it so totally that
I think it’s my goal in some ways,

as a writer, to try to inspire people
to confront the totality of their
life, not just that part of it that
attracts them while they’re awake.
Why did it take so long for
Jacob’s Ladder
produced? The script had been
read by virtually every major
Hollywood producer, every
major studio, all the big
agencies, and yet it has taken
almost 10 years to get it on
film. Everyone said it was the
best-written screenplay in ﬁlm
history. What factors
contributed to its controversy?
Well, number one, it’s not a
total entertainment in the
traditional sense of the word —
it’s a dark movie. It's a movie that
sort of forces you to face things
that a lot of people spend their
whole lives trying not to face. I
think it was also, in its original
conception, an incredibly
expensive movie. On the page,
anyway, it reads like a $60 million
movie. And I think every studio
looked at that and said, “Are you
kidding?” You know, [if it was]
Star Wars, maybe they would
do that, but for a movie like this?
I don’t _think they were ready to
invest that kind of money. And I
think that Carolco [Pictures] went
ahead and did it, was really very

Exclusive interview with the hottest writer in Hollywood

adventuresome in part.

What compelled you to drop
everything, as it were, and go
on this tour across the globe?

Well, I've always had a very
strong need to understand my
own metaphysical or mystical

background, and I was always 

led somehow to believe that I
would find that in the East  I
grew up in America and, you
know, it was a very materialistic
culture. It didn’t seem to address
the inner life at all. And I knew
just as a struggling writer at the
time, that there was a universe

inside me, and that nobody was _ 

teaching me how to tap into it.
And somehow, I really wanted
instruction in that way. I had
come across the whole concept
of yoga and meditation which
were thousands of years old, a
discipline whose whole goal was
to turn you inward, to explore
the inner dimension of man as

opposed to the outer world of his W ,_

creation.

And this has enabled you to
write about life in a whole
new way? H

Oh yeah, it changes everything.

It seems to be challenging
the viewer to engage in a new
way of seeing motion picture
images.

Exactly. I think that’s true. And

I'm starting to hear from peopled”

who are quite awed by it, as well
as people who hate it. And I've
always known that would be the
case because the film is kind of a
Rorschach test. You kind of see

yourself more than "the rmovie. =

People who don’t want to face

the subject that Jacob deals with, I

they’re going to hate me for
writing it. I know that they will.
I’ve experienced it before. aThey
hated Gbost too, you know, and
God knows why, but People
magazine said I should go to hell
for writing that. I don’t quite
understand whatl did that was so
terrible. Now with jacobl can
understand, you know, I can
understand people being upset.
On the other hand, I think that

anybody who has got half a mind, :

who is open to exploring realms
that they don’t normally get a
chance to see, will find Jacob a
wonderfully exciting and
challenging film 

I’m going to come right out -

and say it. What is the meaning
of that ﬁnal scene in Jacob?

What do I think it means?

Yeah.

When you get to the ‘end of the
movie, you realize you’ve just
watched an entirely different
movie than the one you thought
you were seeing, which is a huge
shocker for a lot of people. And

_ then you have to go back and re-

evaluate it. The movie you didn’t
realize you were seeing is a much

more profound work than the‘

thriller that you saw. And going
back, to me, is the essential thing
because then you have to
experience the whole idea of
what it means to be a mind that
is learning how to let go of life in
the last moments or hours of that
experience. You know, most

gm

people have no philosophy, 2-:3‘-‘T-

least not one of their own. They

tend to ado t them from when

they were in Sunday school when
they were 5 years old, or what
their parents or priests or rabbis
told them. They’re not re-
examined. They’re kind of
hanging in some sort of vague
space inside you. In the last
moments of your life, you’re
forced to come up with a
philosophy. And that’s whatjacob
in a sense is doing; not so much
philosophizing, but he’s trying to
deal with the fact that all of these
forces that he had never
considered, all of these archetypal

forces of lightness and dark, you
know, of angelic and demonic
forms, are starting to populate his
mind. Because I believe they are
buried inside the psyche of every
human being. In the old days,
you know, the shepherds used to
sit in the ﬁelds, and they would
commune with the world. Now,
shepherds sit in the fields and
listen to their Sony Walkman. It’s
a very different time and a very
different world, and I believe that
you can’t wait until the last
seconds or nanoseconds of your
life to consider these things

because I believe they all come
alive as you’re leaving this world,
and you should do what Plato
said.

Plato’s last words to his students
as he was lying on his deathbed
were “Practice dying.” And in
fact, that’s what the meditative
life is. It’s learning how to let go
before it’s taken away. Because

if you don't know how to let go
when you can’t have it anymore,
they take you out screaming and
crying, and that’s not the way to
leave this world. You should
embrace what’s coming, rather
than hang on to what’s gone.

Do you have any advice for
struggling screenwriters?
