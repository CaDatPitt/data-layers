up big doin’s to surpass all previous
efforts. There are 20 dances‘ oh the

  PICTURES SHOWN

AT ASSEMBLY

‘The students were entertained at
_last week’s assembly by the presenta-
tion of the photoplay, “Rally Around
the Flag.” The picture was ex-
hibited for the purpose -of arousing
enthusiasm and patriotic rfervor
‘among the students and all -connected
with the University.

The works of our men in the
training camps in America and the
accomplishments of the navy recruits
at different stations were portrayed
in a clear cut fashion. There were
also scenes of the aviation students
at work.

The film consisted of six reels of

interesting data. The ﬁrst part of
the picture showed in what manner
the women and children of America
may be of valuable aid to their coun-
try during the war.
scenes of the army, navy, aviation
and general war’ departments. The
last portion of the photoplay was of
American history, showing in vivid
scenes the work -of the nation
throughout its evolution.

H. J. Heinz used this ’picture for
a period of te.n days in his private
auditoriumon the North Side to en-
tertain his ‘guests and employes and
to arouse among them the feeling of
patriotism and loyalty. It will be
used Wednesday night, February 20,
at the Memorial Hall at the Foreign
Born American Citizens Reception,
under the auspices of the Pittsburgh
Chamber of Commerce. It will after-
wards be distributed to various Y.
M. C. A.’s, churches, High Schools
and educational clubs of the cityanrd

vicinity, who have undertaken to
educate the people to love Our
Country.

The picture was taken by the Bu-
reau of Commercial Economics of
Vvashington, D. C., and was pre-
sented to the University Visual Bu-
reau for distribution. It may be had
for exhibition by any club, church or
other organization that wishes" to
show it to the public. It is loaned
free of -charge and -may be secured
by applying a-t the Visual Bureau of
the Extension Department of “the

TO GIVE ‘HOME
CONCERT APR. 5

The latest success of the Musical
Clubs at the Langwood Community
Club of the EastIEnd last Friday eve-
ning proved to all -possible critics of
the Clubs that their standard this'year
is eritirely up- to the high standards
established by forme-r clu’-bs represent-
ing the University. Before a fairly
1’a'1”§e audience, both Mandolin and
Glee Clubs performed in their usual
‘form. In return they were given a
very cordial reception. Mr. Mande-
ville, of the Mandolin Club, is to be
given credit along with Manager An-
derson for considerable work in .ar-
ranging this concert. '

Readers Reynolds and Marcus’, God-
frey’s‘guitar specialties, _Yardum’s vio-
lin solos and both Mandblin iand Glee

 

. quartets scor-ed certain hits, while both

Mandolin and Glee Clubslwere appar-
ently much enjoyed at every appear-
ance. , , _ -_

It is announced that the next trip of
the ‘Clubs will be a short and free one,
to the Irene Kauf-mann Settlement
vHouse on Center Avenue, on March
-1 or 8. R

The Home Concert, the -biggest an-
nual event,- it was deﬁnitely ascertained
at a, business meeting last Mond.ay,
will -be given Friday evening, April 5,
for one night,/only, in Carnegie Music
Hall. A novel feature of this c—once~rt
will be the participation by the_Gir1s’
Glee ‘Club in rendering 'a couple num-
bers. As to whether and -when a ban-_
quet and dance would be given was
left "to the Executive -Clommittee to
ascertain. This was the s«ec«ond‘»sbusi-
ness meeting .of the year. Director
Gaul and Alumni Adviso-r Dr.  R.

utive Committee consists of H. M.

FOR ORDNANCE

Clad in khaki, -the ‘men in the
Fourth Ordnance Course will begin

 

their work, this week. The course,

which was scheduled to begin. on
M0nd3Y,' Was ‘delayed a few days on
account -ofethe. fact that the new men
were required to go to Columbus,
Ohio, in order t-o be equipped with
uniforms before reporting at Pitt.

The coursewill have 64 men, all
of whom were sent through Colum-
bus on what is known as a “depot
post.” From there they will return
to Pitt to begin work. They will
work along the same lines as the
previous, courses, doing co-operative
work three afternoons aweek in ten
of the largest concerns in thecity.

The men who have just completed
the last-course haveﬁnished all ar-
rangements preparatory to
sent to San Antonio, Texas, where
they will begin practical work in the
army ordnance department.

The ﬁfth course willbegin about
April 1st, and candidates are being
signed up now. The drill for the
men hasbeen under;the direction of
Ordnance Sergeant Edinger. Lieu-
tenant Keir, under whose direction
the ordna'nce ‘work is being con-
ducted, said that the men in the new
course may have a- ﬁeld day and
show the effective drill work that
they are able to do in the shout time
of six weeks. ‘

Owing to the appearance of several
cases of smallpox in the city during
the last few months, the city of Pitts-
burgh sent a letter to the Department
of Health of the University asking
that department to make sure that
every student was vaccinated. Th-is
letter also stated that all students

 

be vaccinated immediaitely. The
University has sent out letters con-
taining’ blanks to be ﬁlled out ‘by. the

a _scar. .. _ «
Many students have paid no; atten-
tion to these notices and few replies
have been received ‘by the. Health
Department. These letters were sent
out by the Chancellor through.«the
main ofﬁce of the University. They
must be a-ttended to -at «once and the
vaccination blanks _returned‘immed-
iately. To show that the Univers-
ity is in earnest, Dr. .E. M. Frost,
stated that students will be expelled
upon failure to return the blanks.
Vaccination is compulsory when
registering. All new stude'nts.sh~ould
report atonce to Dr. M. Frost.

this A.letter must necessarily be ﬁlled

George and, I were certainly out of
luck when we were sent abroad without
first getting our ﬂying in the States.
We would pro ably have our commis-
sions by this time had we stayed.theI'e.
By thertime we get back we should
at least be able to translate the French
on,1:lhe menus at the hotels. That is
about the first things we learned. My
two years in this language at Pitt has
helped me a great deal. . .

We are fortunate in being located at
the present time, ‘in one of ‘the best
camps in‘ 'France._ More liberty, though,
would be greatly appr_eciated. We are
thoroughly contented when we are-al-'
Alowed 'to.visit “la. ville.” . -
Later;- have been on guard for-24
hours. Great pastime, ‘that! Plenty of
time to think, and no ﬁshing allowed.

We had planned this afternoon to take?"
a long trip up to New Castle and» all ‘-
along the coast of theINorth Sea. But
it began to rain and I, thought it all
off.A I had no more than started this
1Aetter than.the pilot I was going with «
suggested that we go anyway and Are- 9
turn by night, thus getting some night
ﬂying. We had no more,ithan left the
aerodome than it began to hail. La.teA1‘~ 
it turned to snow. It was blowing aVA
regular gale, too, and the wind was‘
blowing at least 60 miles an hour with,
us goin at about 90 miles per hour.
The hai seemed to be tearing the ﬂesh ’
from your face. A - . ~ —

Lost IntClouds.

We tried ‘to get beyond the storm and‘
then above it but the clouds. were;.so
thick that we immediately became lost;
We ﬁnally gave it up as a badjob‘ and..;
returned to the.,aerodome. The air was 
so awfully bumpy that at times. I was.
thrown from the. seat.‘ The pilot I was
with spent several years at the front.
and had been chased by the Huns so
many times that he Ahas no idea of
nerves. He will go up in any kind of
-weather.‘ ‘It’s a-life that never lacks.

lnterfraternity League‘

Gets Auspicious Start

A’ Phi Gamma Delta Beats Delta

Sigma Phi 24-17 and Sigma
Kappa Downs Sigma Epsi-
lon 38-33. '

The Interfraternity League. got a
ﬂying start last Tuesday and Thurs-
day nights, when the team represent-
ing Phi Ga‘mma’ Delta, defeated the
Delta Sigma Phi team, 24 to 17, and
the Sigma Kappa Pi Five downed
the Sigma Epsilon Ffaternity, 38 to
33.

The Phi Gamma and Delta Sigma
Phi game, took place on Tuesday
night. This proved a very interest-

ing game, though it proved the for-
mer’s game all through the contest.

For the Phi Gamma Deltas, Massing-I

bau and Keister played forwards,
with Mengis at center and Hileman
and Seidle at guards. Massingbau
and Mengis starred on the scoring
end, while Seiclle proved his ability
as a guard. Hileman, who cap-
tained the Freshman Eleven last sea-
son, did his best to keep up his repu-
tation and from the reports of the
‘spectators did good work. Seidle,
the Varsity football man for the last.
three or four years, is ‘captain of the
team. For Delta Sigma Phi Jones
led his team in scoring, making four
ﬁeld goals and one foul. Captain
McCarty played a good game at
guard, and did well from the foul
line, making three out of four fouls.
Mills did well at center, making him-

self quite a handful for Mengis.

The line-up of the games follows:
Phi Gamma Delta Delta Sigma Phi

Massingbau ............ ..F .................. .. Jones
Keister .................... -.F ......  Ashbaugh
Mengiq ~C , Mills
Hileman ................ ..G..(Capt.) McCarty
Seidle (Capt) ....... .-G .................... .. Ryan

Field goals—Massingb.au, 3; Mengis,
2; Hileman, Dickey, 3; Jones, 4;
Ashbaugh, McCarty. Foul goals-
Massingbau, 6 out of 9; Jones, 1 out
of 5; McCarty, 3 out of 4; Ryan 1
out of 1. Substitutes-—-Dickey for
Keister. Referee--Eckhardt.

On . Thursday night, the Sigma
Kappa Pi team defeated the Sigma
Epsilon Five, in one of the most in-
teresting games of the season, it re-
quiring an extra ﬁve minutes to de-
cide the «contest. The two teams
fought throughout the game, with
only one or two points separating
them, until’ at the end of the contest
they stood at a tie at 32 to 32. Dur-
ing.the extra ﬁve minutes the Sigma
Kappa.men, showed the “best form
of the season and ca-ged three ﬁeld
goals while their opponents were
making but ‘one point.

The Sigma Kappa Pi men have a
team which will bear watching, sev-
eral men -of note being members.
One of the best men of the Fra-
ternity, Young, who is star player
of the Avalon Fire Company team,
was not in the game, but will play
in ‘the remaining contests- Fruit,
played a star game at guard, caging
three field goals and holding his op-
ponent to a very low score. Eek-

In a Decisive Contest

PITT FIVE LOSE ’
THREE GAMES

Pitt's invasion of the East resulted

First, Lafayette set them back in the
opening game, 37-3l,~then the Army
Five handed them a 30-22 defeat and
Lehigh capped the invasion with .a
39-26 victory. The work of Penman
on the offensive and McLaren at
guard, were the features of the trip.

Pitt was checked at the very out_-S

set of the invasion by the Eastonians
The
team. was late on arriving, due to the
train service, and they were hustled
right into the game. This will ac-
count in some measure for the poor
showing. ‘ ‘ I
At that Pitt put up a game ﬁght.
Lafayette took the lead at the start
and always managed to keep a few
points ahead of the Pit-tites. Then,
just before the whistle blew, they
tacked on a few extra goals. Ander-
son was the big gun for the Lafay-
ette Five, making a perfect record
from the foul line and caging six
ﬁeld goals ‘for a total of 27 points.
It was impossible for the Pitt guards
to stop the captain. Penman was
the leading point getter for the Blue
and Gold, with -a total of 21. ‘

has been customary in the past for
Pitt .to lose on Lehigh's ﬂoor and
-then rout them at Tree's gym, a sort
of gentleman's agreement. It would
not be at all surprising if the Panth-

lemen Five snowed them under.

»,tory Friday, for theywill be -out for
blood.

If Pitt,can capture three of the re-
maining ﬁve games, they will -have_
made a successful -closing for the
season. Considering the calibre of
-the teams’ on the schedule, this will
be a herculean task for them, Lehigh,
State, twice, W. _& J. and.Te.ch, -being
their remaining opponents. '
