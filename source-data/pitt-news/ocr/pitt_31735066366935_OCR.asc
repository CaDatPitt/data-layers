Dr. Herbert Aptheker
Denounces US. Policy

To University Audience

By DEVRA LEE DAVIS

National Director of the Amer-
ican Institute for Marxist Studies
Dr. Herbert Aptheker surprised
I a capacity audience in the Stu-
dent Union Ballroom Wednesday,
by initially agreeing with Secre-

tary of State Dean Rusk.
’ In one of his rare moments of
mirth, Secretary Rusk related
this appraisal of human nature
to the House Foreign Affairs Com-
mittee: “One-third of the world’s
population is asleep at any given
time; the other two—thirds are
awake and probably commiting
some mischief.” This was one of
the few_issues about which Dr.
Aptheker and the State Depart-
' ment would concur. 4 ‘
Reading from a prepared pa-
per, Dr. Aptheker aired the in-
4*‘/tensely controversial question of
 U. S. policy in Vietnam. In schol-
"arly fashion, he rejected admin-
istration justiﬁcation for U. S. in-

volvement.

The domino theory maintains
that if Vietnam is lost to the
Communists, Thailand, Cambodia
and Laos, will fall under Com-
munism, and the balance of pow-
er will be menacingly challenged.
Dr. Aptheker testily dismissed

 this notion, claiming that qur po-
licy has ﬂung all the dominoes
upon. the ﬂoor, losing prestige
and inﬂuence in the process, es-
. pecially by bombing North Viet-
nain. g
The claim that Chinese aggres-
sion demands U. S. action pro-
vides another rationale, which
Aptheker attempted -—’to debunk.
, Rather than give evidence that
«Q; there was not Chinese aggression’
in Vietnam,
shoe on the other foot; here “was
a case of thief calling-thief.”

He called on the audience tol

4 imagine American action if “Chi-

nese troops were stationed near ~
and Chinese ﬂeets ‘patrolled the-

American coast, while their in-
telligence aircraft/ ﬂew over the
United States.”
Another explanation for the
_, “ge.t-tough” policy is that it re-
lﬁr‘-/ﬂects the lessons of Munich and
rejection of appeasement policies,
which strength-ened and encour-
aged enemies. This reasoning is
based upon fallaeious interpreta-
tion, Dr. Aptheker maintained.
“Munich is no example of ap-
peasement. . . . Hitler" was built
up by capital interests in Ger-
many, France, England, and the
United States.” -
Aptheker challenged U. S. im-
plications that there is no popu-
lar support» for the National Lib-
, " - eration "Front. He cited the com-
 ments of_Senator Stephen Young,
in a little publicized speech, “Ac-
cording to General Westmorland
and General Stillwell, 80 per cent
of the Viet Cong are South Viet-‘
namese natives, not inﬁltrators.”
Dr. Aptheker emphatically noted
“the indigenous nature of revolu-
tions in Southeast Asia,” but did
‘ ”.agree with Secretary of Defense
-- Robert MacNamara that the war
.in Vietnam is no "longer a civil
" war. -

Aptheker put the

While Secretary MacNainaIra had

U. S. troops. He also noted that
U. S. casualities currently exceed
South Vietnam’s.

Dr. Aptheker said that certain
academicians deem anti-Commun-
ism the big base of Hitler and
Nazism; it is on this “anti-Co-m-
munism psychosis” which the
Germans were gulled, as was
most of the capitalist world. This
same anti-Communist is current-
ly being evoked to defend the

U. S. policy in Southeast Asia.

The U. S. has failed to make
public precisely what it wants in
Vietnam, according to Dr. Apthe-
ker. What is known is that proj-
ected ﬁgures
American men will die in Viet-
nam, in the nextseven years. “If
to dissent from this course is
treason, I ask that my name be
placed high on the roll of trai-
tors.”

Dr. Aptheker questioned the
meaning of victory in Vietnam.
From Senator Russell Long the
idea of victory has summoned

_such comments as: “If the United

States is going to be defeated, let
it, at least, be defeated-by a big
power.” From Vice-President Hu-
bert Humphrey, our present stance
evoked this statement: “Whether
right‘ or wrong, we are in Viet-
nam . . . and we are there.”

To ' these assessments, Dr. Ap-
theker added a reﬁnement’ of
Stephen Decatur, who said, “My
country, right or wrong." “My
country. If right, support it. If
wrong, set it right.”

The audience quelled the spor-
adic heckling of a group of high
school students who said they
were going to join Young Ameri-
can for Freedom. The formal

speech ‘was favorably received_
-by most of the audience, a fourth

of Whom gave Dr. Aptheker a
standing ovation.

Charles H. Peake predicts there will be “a strong faculty” I
in the Fall of 1966. “In addition to new permanent appoint-'}_
ments,” explained Dr. Peake, “we have several outstanding
visiting faculty professors who will be here in the fall.’_’ ’_ D _

Dr. Peake also explained that a number of “important.
appointments are still in negotiation.” When asked about,..}
the possible increase of 1,000 more students in the fall, Dr.-
Peake said that as many as 600 of them will be transfer";
students who can‘ be easily\absorbed in upper level classes. ~  F '

To meet the increased numbers of freshmen, Dr. Peake said, the
University is “planning to. make appropriate increases in the num-.
ber of teaching fellows and instructors in order to meet the demand 

at the freshmen level.” '

Commuter Bill Reveals
Transportation Data

A commuter poll, conducted by the newly-formed Com-
muter Organization last term, has revealed that the num-
ber of fares collected by -the Port Authority Transit (PAT)
system from University students would increase from 1,500
to 2,800‘ per week if rates were “signiﬁcantly reduced.”

In announcing these ﬁgures, Ron Cowell, chairmanlof

the poll committee, noted that

’ the results would be sent to PAT

officials along with similar re-
sults received in ‘commuter polls
on other campuses in the city.
The sampling also established
the fact that 75 per cent of the
500' commuters who participated
in the poll drive to school at one
time or another. The expressed
demand for better parking was
so great that the Comlmuter Or-
ganization has formed a special
committee to study, possible solu-
tions to the parking problem.

One _interesting suggestion re- '

  
    
 
  

tend class and return to the me-
ter before their time was ex-
pended. Cowell said that this
would relieve a major complaint
of commuters. '

The Commuter Organization has 1

also begun exploring the possi-
bility of setting up commuter
mail boxes to facilitate communi-
cation among commuters and be-
..tween‘commuters and campus or-
ganizations. The organization has
not decided where the boxes will
be located or how they will be
assigned to} commuting students.

-Longer Than in‘ the Past

 

. Libraries

Despite decreased enrollment
during the Spring trimester, the
University’s libraries will have
slightly longer hours during the
week than in previous trimesters.

Arthur Schell, recently appoint-
ed associate director for public
services, has authorized extended
hours in order to standardize
opening and closing times and
make the various libraries seem
more uniﬁed.

The Circulation Department,
the Open Stacks, the Reserve
Book Room, the Periodical Room,
and the Reference Room will be
open from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. Mon-
day through Thursday.

The libraries have been closed
on Sundays for the past two
spring terms and this policy will
continue. “This has nothing to do
with ﬁnancial problems,’ ’accord-
ing to Mr. Schell,

Set Hours

The libraries “base their serv-
ice on needs” and, during the
spring there is just no demand
for library service on Sundays.

Library usage during the rest
of the week is also very sparse.

For example, on the second
Saturday of this term spot checks
at ﬁve different hours revealed

from two to ten people in the

referhnce room. The periodical
room had even less use with a
maximum of eight people at any
one of the four spot checks.

The Reserve Book Room circu-
lated a grand total of 14 books,
while Main Circulation recorded
88 books and the Open Stacks
had 60 books. These numbers are
considerably lower than corres-
ponding ﬁgures for the other two
terms when hundreds of books
are circulated each day from the
various libraries.

Letters to the Editor

the editor of Th-e Pitt News. In
a marvel of twisted logic that
has overtones reminiscent of the
late Senator. McCarthy, he con-
structs the following syllogism:
“In the past campus political
groups have restricted their in-
vitations to speakers who_ are
sympathetic to their political
views. The Young Democrats
have brought in candidates‘ en-
dorsed by their party and the
Young Republicans have done
likewise.” Therefore, we are in-
vited to conclude, SFP must be a

.“Commie front group,” or else

why would it have invited Dr.
Aptheker? A s
The fallacies in this line of

reasoning (to stretch the term)
are pathetically obvious. Certain-
137“ the Young Democrats have
brought in Democrats. Does the
man , actually expect them to
have brought in Repub1icans?~But
of what relevance is this to Dr.
Aptheker and SFP? The answer
is brutally simple: none whatso-
ever. It makes absolutely no
sense to compare the Young Dem-
ocrats or Young Republicans to
SFP. The former two groups exist
solely to ‘elect candidates; nat-
urally, they insist on political con-
formity. The purpose of the SFP,
in contrast, is to present pro-
grams and other informative ac-
tivities which will win student’
and faculty adherents to the idea
of peace in general, and which
will convert them to vocal op-
ponents of the war in Vietnam
in particular.

It follows, therefore, that_SFP '

is interested in sponsoring the \‘
appearance of any sincere and

‘ well-known opponent of the war

and Vietnam, with no further,
questions asked. Although it may
pain the editor of The Pitt'News,
SFP has not functioned, as an in-
quisitorial body to poke its col-
lective nose into the personal
views of each -and every speaker;
nor will it do so in the future.
‘The organization has more im-
portant tasks at hand, even if
the editor of The Pitt News has
not.

Ah, but, The Pitt News pro-
ceeds, by inviting Aptheker with-
out issuing a non-Communist dis-

claimer, “the Students for Peace '

leave themselves open to much

The



  
 

criticism. Campus groups
will ﬁnd it all the easier to put
stereotyped labels on the peace
organization.”

Of course, they wil1—now that
The Pitt News has shown the
way by its red-baiting (the only
adequate word) of SFP! In effect,
the editor says to ‘SFP: either the
invitation to Dr. Aptheker was a
nefarious Communist plot (since,
as we all know, Young Republi-
cans present only Republican

speakers); or else SFP must en- ’

gage in an orgy of. Communist
denouncing that will be suffici-

ently vehement to satisfy the -

self-appointed judges of political
purity who inhabit The. Pitt News.
A nice pair of alternatives in-
deed! .

What makes. The Pitt News
editorial even-more odious is the
explicit claim that the newspa-
per is acting out of a fraternal
concern for the best interests of
SFP. Needless to emphasize, this

.notion is the most arrant non-

sense. If The Pitt News were gen-
uinely alarmed that “stereotyped
labels” might be. placed on SFP
for -inviting Dr. Aptheker, it
would have run an editorial con-
demning such a practice, rather
than one which encourages fur-
ther efforts in the same vein.

What’s more, to present a pic--

ture of The Pitt News as a defen-
der of SFP, as did the editorial
in question, is to indulge in a
wild ﬂight of fancy, to say the
least. Contrary to what it alleged,
The Pitt News did not defend
SFP’s -“right to’ be " an integral
part of the University activities”
when, toward_the end of last tri-
mester, this right was menaced
by a combination of adrninistra—
tion spokesman and their student-
accomplices. At best, the news-
paper straddled the issue with a
wishy-washy editorial that studi-
ously refused to take a hard-and-
fast position. More important was
what The'Pitt News did not do:
it did not point out that all the
charges against SFP were spuri-
ous, lacking the least shred of
evidence to support them; and it
did not report that only the
threat of SFP members to attend

the Administration’s hearing en T

masse and with faculty support-
ers C0mDel1ed the charges to be

. - dropped as suddenly as" they

had been invented. Given these
crucial" omissions on the part of
The Pitt News, its self-assigned
role as the protector of SFP‘ is
both curious and rather at vari-
ance with the facts.

The ﬁnal paragraph of The
Pitt News’ distorted~ assault on
SFP—and the right of free speech
—-reads as follows: “If Students
for Peace wish to be a broad
based campus activity (,) they
would be well advised. to explain
the reason for their invitations to
Dr. -Aptheker.” .

With all due respect for the
newspaper’s scrupulous concern

"for the welfare of SFP, it must
be insisted that such ‘‘explana- ‘

tion” as was necessary was pre-
sented by The Pitt News itself
in the article announcing Dr.
Aptheker’s address (a-nd was re-
iterated in this _letter). Nothing
more by Way of “explanation” is
required here, save to observe: 1)
That the decision to request Dr.
Aptheker to come to Pitt was
made at a meeting of SFP; 2)
That these meetings are open to
anyone wishing to atted them,
and 3) That if The Pittt News has
been lax in its duties of covering
them, this can in no ‘way be
blamed on SFP. '
Above all, for SFP to comply
with the wishes of the editor of
The Pitt News by making a rit-
ual denunciation of Communism
would be at once to relinquish
all the gains for free speech and
an unfettered.‘ political life that
have been recorded since the per-
iod of McCarthy. SFP could do
the students at Pitt no more

-grave disservice than to act in

such a manner.

But if within a year the new‘state relations has not solved some of
our more pressing problems then the University may be faced with multiple
resignations. For example, low level administrators enjoy the comfort
of plush offices replate with wall to Wall carpeting and expensive furni-
ture. At the sametime nationally recognized professors are cramped into
dreary holes somewhere in the Cathedral attic. *
‘ Ultimately the best thing the University could do to avert this crisis
is to remove the long developing feeling that the faculty is regarded as
a second class group somewhere close to the student level but miles be— 3
neath the administrative nobility. R
It would seem improbable that a faculty which felt part of the ad-
ministration and its decision making would desert that administration en

Through the hard work of Dr. Peake and the academic deans the Uni-
versity has been able to continue to build a strong faculty. But the real test
of- the faculty-administrative relation lies ahead and his test must be faced.

football coach, Jim Carlen, came to the land of Moun-

ty plights of that state but must have never realized Just
how far reaching that poverty was. At last Saturday’s

Stand with Parsons

Parsons College provides the entertainment for the
baseball team’s long delayedhome opener today at Leech
Farm Road at 1 :45 p.m. After eight games on the road, one
month in length, a home game may be just what coach
Bobby Lewis needs to boost the mitters’ 5-4.record. -

Last week Duquesne and Bucknell appeared in the

team’s win column,
minster dropped the mitters, 2-1.
The game was a duel between
pitchers Don Stock and Bill Kelly.

Until the sixth inning, the Ti-

tans held a 2-0 edge. In the sixth,
Dave Welty, the leftﬁelder, reach-
ed first via an error. A moment
later, he scored on third base-
man Tom Beckett’s double. The
run proved to be the only one the
mitters -were to scratch off of
Kelly. '
Stock allowed just ﬁve hits to
Kelly’s six,
bunched them in the third inning.
“We didn’t hit well against West-
minster,” Lewis said. “Our hits
were spread out and'we didn’t
get them at the right time.” '

After the Titan loss, Lewis must

players, for the next day, the mit-
ters went out and ‘raised their
batting’
quesne. They collected 12 runs on
15 hits from the Dukes, whose
record stood at 9-1.

Winning his second game of
the season, left Welty struck out
12 batters and allowed only two
hits.
‘a chance to ﬁeld when Welty
pitches,” Lewis said. “Not only
does he strike out the batters,
but he gets a lot of them to hit
back to him.”

Centerﬁeld Ferd Sauer had
four hits in the game to lead the
attack. Beckett, Welty, and pitch-
er-catcher Don Stock each had
two, while shortstop Steve Kienzl
continued his power hitting with
a home run. ‘ '

Relief pitcher Mark Zovko got
Bucknell catcher Hank Henric.k-
son to hit into a game ending
double play with the tying run
on third and the winning run on

The Bisons led 3-2 going into

THE COLLEGE PRESIDENT :
HIS CAUSE AND CURE

Oh, sure, you’ve been busy, what with going to classes, doing
your homework, catching night crawlers, getting married,
picketing—but can’t you pause for just a moment and give
thought. to that dear, dedicated, lonely man in the big white
house on the hill? I refer, of course, to Prexy.

(It is interesting to note.that college presidents are al-
ways called “Prexy.” Similarly, trustees are always called

“Trixie.” Associate professors are always called “Axy-Pixy.” '

Bursars are called “Foxy-Woxy.” Students are called
‘‘Algae.’’) -

But I digress. We were speaking of Prexy, a personage
at once.august and pathetic. Why pathetic? Well, sir, con-
sider how Prexy spends his days. He is busy, busy, busy.
He talks to deans, he talks to professors, he talks to trus-
tees, he talks to alumni. In fact, he talks to everybody ex-
cept the one group who could lift his heart and rally his
spirits. I mean, of course, the‘ appealingest, endearingest,
winsomest group in the entire college—delightful you, the
students. _

It is Prexy’s sad fate to be forever a stranger to your
laughing, golden selves. He can only gaze wistfully out the
window of his big white house on the hill and watch you at
your games and sports and yearn with all his tormented
heart to bask in your warmth. But how? It would hardly
be ﬁtting for Prexy to appear one day at the Union, clad in

an old rowing blazer, and cry gaily, “Heigh-ho, chapsl

Who’s for sculling?” -

No, friends, Prexy can’t get to you. It is up to you to get
to him. Call on him at home. Just.,drop in unannounced. He
will naturally be a little shy at ﬁrst, so you must put himat
his ease. Shout, “Howdy-doody, sir! I have come to bring a
little sunshine into your drear and blighted life!” Then
yank his necktie out of his vest and scamper goatlike
around him until he is laughing merrily along with you.
Then hand him a package and say, “A little gift for you,
s1r.” ' '

“For me?” he‘-will say, lowering his lids. f‘You shouldn’t
have.” «

  

“Yes, I should,” you will say,"‘because this is a pack of _

Personna Super Stainless Steel Blades, and whenever I
think of Personna Super Stainless Steel Blades, I think of
ou. , —

“Why, hey?” he will ask curiously.

“Because, sir,” youwill say, “though you are no longer’
a young blade, still you gleam and function. Full though
you are of years and lumps, rheumy though your endocri-nes
and ﬂaccid your hamstrings, still you remain sharp, incl.-
sive, efficacious.” ‘ ‘

‘.‘Thank you,” he will say, sobbing. -»..,

“So it is with Personna,” you will continue. “Naturall
you expect a brand-new blade to give a close, speedy shave.

' But how about a blade that’s had hard and frequent use?

Do you still expect a close, speedy shave? Well, sir, if it's a,
Personna, that's what_you’ll get. Because, sir, like you, sir,
Personna is no ﬂash-1n-the-pan. Like you, sir, Personna
ab1des.”_ , » ~ I
_ HIE Wlll clasp your handthen, not trusting himself to
spea . . ’ ‘
. “But away with gloom!” you will cry jollily. “For I have
still more good news to tell you of Personna !” r \

“How is that possible?” he will say.

“Hearken to me,” you will say. “Personna, in all its en-
during splendor, is available not only in Double Edge style A
but also in I—njector‘style!”
