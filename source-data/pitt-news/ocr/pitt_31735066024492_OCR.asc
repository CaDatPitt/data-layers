City fire department, SGB
clash at Council meeting

By Jason Hillman

and Julie Sabol
T be Pitt News

Pittsburgh Public Safety
Director Glenn Cannon called
the Student Government Board’s
testimony “irresponsible and
inappropriate” at a City Council
hearing yesterday on the
proposed removal of Engine
Company No. 14- from South
Oakland. . ,

Although 11 Pittsburgh citizens
argued to keep the fire truck,
council member Michelle Madoff
said, “We can’t do anything. We
have no power [over the fire
truck].”

“The whole things stinks of
politics,” SGB president Gil
Golden said. “Because all they
need to do is come into South
Oakland and walk down a street
with their eyes open. It doesn’t

take much. I just pointed out the
Obvious.”

During the hearing, Golden
read a letter urging Mayor Sophie
Masloff to reconsider removing
the truck, which carries water
and hoses to a fire from Engine
Company 14 located on the corner
of McKee Place and Louisa Street.
If the engine is removed, company
14 will only have a truck that
carries ladders.

“We need a rapid response
time. All the firefighters in the
world with all the ladders in the
world are not going to stop the
rapid spread of fires in Oakland
unless they have a timely and
adequate supply of water,”
Golden said.

Cannon said SGB members had
met with him before and had
never indicated that they had a
problem with the removal of the
engine. “The first we heard that

there was a problem was when
that fellow [Gil Golden], read that
letter today,” Cannon said.

“I really don’t think that
comment is entirely accurate,”

Golden said. “He had nevertalked ,

to this ‘fellow’, but if nothing
else, he knew we were
concerned. How many times do
people in my office have to meet
with him to prove we’re
concerned?”

The hearing was held in
response to a request from
Pittsburgh residents to discuss
the proposed removal of Engine
No. 14. Masloff was not present.

Council memberjim Ferlo said,
“Sophie’s choice is let the public
be damned.” »

“We’re not at ease, and we
don’t have peace of mind. I would
like to know why Oakland is
being so rejected,” Oakland

 College campusesdivided on issue of ‘hate speech’

9/’

By Gary Knapick
Senior Stajf Writer

About two years ago, a flurry of cover
stories in most of the nation’s major
newsweeklies brought to light a problem
that pits the ideals of free thought and

~ speech against the U.S. stated commitment

to equality——— the prevalence of harassment
and so-called “hate speech.”

While buzzwords like “political
correctness” may have become household
terms over the past few months, drawing
the line between freedom of expression
has long been a point of turmoil on
college campuses.

As Stanford law Professor Charles L.
Lawrence wrote in The Chronicle of
Higher Education, “Racial insults are
particularly undeserving of First
Amendment protection because the
perpetrator’s intention is not to discover
truth or initiate dialogue but to injure the
victim.”

But others question the wisdom of trying
to snuff out potentially disagreeable ideas
on campus. “After all,” argued Nat Hentoff
in an article of The Progressive, “if students
are to be ‘protected’ from bad ideas, how

are they going to learn to identify and
cope with them? Sending such ideas
underground simply makes them stronger
and more dangerous.”

These sentiments are echoed by New
York University student Barry Endick,
whose editorial in his school’s newspaper
was used by Hentoff in support of his
argument.

“We ought to examine why students, so
anxious to wield the Fourteenth
Amendment, give short shrift to the First.
Yes, Virginia, there are racist assholes.
And you know what, the Constitution
protects them, too.”

“The university can’t mandate sensitivity,”
said Pitt College Republican Jon Kurland.

“I don’t think [a code governing speech] ‘

would create sensitivity. If anything, it will
increase resentment and tension among
[campus] groups.”

As Oliver Wendell Holmes once said, “If
there is any principle of the Constitution
that more imperatively calls for attachment
than any other, it is the principle of free
thought — not free only for those who
agree with us, but freedom for the thought
we hate.” ‘

But when Voltaire said ,”I may disagree

with what you say, but I’ll defend to the
death your right to say it,” could he have
foreseen the immense impact that words
can have on the liberty and quality of life
of the victim?

According to the university's Student
Code of Conduct andjudicial Procedures,
students have crossed the lines of Pitt’s
code on harassment when they engage in
conduct that “creates an intimidating,
hostile, or offensive environment,
impeding the educational opportunities
[of others], providing that the conduct is
based on the race, color, religion, ethnicity,
national origin, race, age, sex, sexual
orientation or the marital, veteran or
handicapped status” of others.

Offenses listed in the code also include
threats, intimidations, or uses of physical
force which cause another person to be
“reasonably apprehensive” and
intimidation via telephone or other
electronic media.

Dr. Susan Rubisch-Gisler, coordinator
of Pitt’s Student Judicial System, makes a
distinction between harassment and hate
speech. According to Rubisch-Gisler,
harassment is typically geared at a specific
person, while hate speech is generally an

open attack on an entire group’s race,
religion sex, or sexual orientation.

For the most part, the University of
Pittsburgh has been spared the trials that
many colleges have undergone. Aside
from a few minor incidents, this code of
conduct has never been put to the test in
the way that the codes of other colleges
have been.

Hentoff pointed to many examples that
would su rely make our administrators feel
grateful for the relative calm that prevails
at Pitt. For instance, ﬂiers saying that
blacks “don’t belong in classrooms, they
belong hanging from trees" was once
distributed at the University of Michigan.
At Temple University, a White Students
Union with 130 members has been a
center of controversy.

At the law school of the State University
of New York at Buffalo, several women
students were the targets of several
“venomously sexist" letters. And at Penn
State University, where racial tensions
have usually run high, sparks are still
flying after PSU student Chino Wilson
wrote an editorial calling on blacks to take

up arms against whites.

Aretha Franklin reflected the
spirit of an emerging black
America in the '60s, Lewis said.
She sang “You Make Me Feel Like

interrupted it in the middle to
ask, “What the hell is a natural

Tina Turner, Lewis said, is “all

Lewis said, but the civil—rights

Iewis said

When asked her opinion of rap

Speech

Continued from page 1

“I haven't been bombarded with complaints [of harassmentl,"
Affirmative Action Director William Savage said.

Savage, who said he has dealt with four cases of harassment

. since taking office in July, warned that the low number of cases
his office may not be reliable indicators of the true severity of
the problem. ‘

Indeed, there is a small yet undeniable undercurrent of hatred
at Pitt. In commemoration of Martin Luther King Jr. Day, one
student took it upon himself to scribble “Happy Nigger Day”
inside a Tower C elevator.

Announcement flyers from groups as varied as the Black
Action Society or the Campus Women’s Organization are
routinely altered by others.

The swastika, long the emblem of misguided teenage nihilism,
appears in a variety of public places. “Die faggots” is commonly
scratched into the doors of bathroom stalls in Pitt dorms.

“I know that it happens at Pitt, and I’m ashamed of that fact,”
saidJoel Leonard, president of Pitt’s University Democrats. “But
I think that it’s a problem anywhere in today’s society. Socially,
we’re moving backwards.”

Savage said. a statement of policy in -the code of conduct
probably wouldn’t discourage acts of hatred or aggression and
that the best way to combat such tensions on campus is to
“address bigotry and bias” directly and personally.

“The most effective means is not with large groups, but in
small groups, when individuals can express their feelings,”
Savage said. .

Savage said programs like the cultural-diversity session for
new students are a step in the right direction.

Gallagher

Continued from page 2
said he intended to teach after
graduation, but then something
changed his plans.

Upon graduation, Gallagher
was awarded a scholarship for
the Harvard University master’s
program in guidance and
counseling.

He also received a three-
year NDEA Graduate Fellowship
from Rutgers University to earn a
master’s and doctoral degree in
counseling psychology.

Gallagher chose the Rutgers
fellowship and was awarded his
doctoral degree in 1968.

In 1966, Gallagher accepted a
position as a psychologist in the
counseling center at the
University of Pittsburgh. He was
promoted to the director of the
center in 1971.

Many students may have
already indirectly received
guidance from Gallagher through
his biweekly Pitt News column
“Coping On Campus.”

The Counseling and Student
Development Center consists of
three main departments:
counseling, career development
and the leaming—skills center.
Among other things, Gallagher
has helped to get funding
authorized for the learning—skills
center.

Gallagher said psychological
services have helped many
students both personally and
academically.

“Even though many students
do not feel as though they have
academic problems, many

: students report that counseling

 

helped them to do better
academically and in their careers,
even though they came into the
center for personal problems,”
he said.

Gallagherencouragedstudents
to take advantage of the services
available to them at the counseling
center,

“A lot of students think there is
a stigma attached to seeing
someone at the center, yet it is
probably one of the healthiest
things you can do,” Gallagher
said.

When talking about the center
as a whole, Gallagher said, “We
feel as though we make major
contributions to the academic side
of education, while helping
students achieve their personal
goals too." ,

In his spare time, Gallagher
said he enjoys movies, novels,
sports and the New England
seashore.

He used to‘ enjoy playing
racquetball, but has given it up
because he “can’t find anyone
that he can beat any more.” He
has also recently rediscovered
golf.

Get a life

The abortion battle continues in America, and it’s high
time it ended.

We are all familiar with the story: Some argue abortion
is murder, and others support a woman’s right to choose
a safe and legal abortion. Yet a growing number of people
fall in the “middle” on the issue — usually out of disgust
from protests at clinics or simple frustration.

At the National Press Club last week, Pennsylvania Gov.
Robert Casey warned his fellow Democrats not to endorse
“the most extreme pro-choice view.” Republicans for Free
Choice has been pressuring the Republican National
Committee to adopt a pro-choice plank similar to the one
shared by the Democratic Party.

Gov. Casey’s view misses the abortion debate by miles.
’I‘he pro-choice position is not extreme. It is founded on
cultural sensibilities embedded in the  Constitution.

Understandably, there is nothing in the Constitution
claiming a right to an abortion. But equally relevant, there
is nothing in the Constitution restricting a woman’s
decision to choose an abortion. Roe U. Wade, the 1973
decision overturning the illegal status and restriction of
abortion, put the decision in the hands ofthe people most
impacted by abortion: women.

The pro-choice view respects moral diversity. Certain
religious viewpoints bar abortion; others are silent on the
issues. Still others actively support whatever decision a
woman makes. ’l'he only way to respect everyone is to
allow individuals to follow their faiths, morals or
judgements.

In response to Gov. Casey, abortion legislation in
Pennsylvania is anything but “moderate.” Women will
die. ‘

’l'he Pennsylvania Abortion Control Act was signed into
law in 1989. Since then it has worked its way through the
federal courts. Now on appeal to the Supreme Court, the
outlook is grim; Roe v. Wade will be its victim.

’I‘he legislation is actually an extremist document. It
forces doctors to coerce women with propaganda
discouraging their decision. It asks for a 24-hour waiting
period on abortion after an appointment is set. For rural-
area women, traveling 50-I00 miles to Pittsburgh twice in
two days will not facilitate their health care.

Even more extreme is the provision requiring parental
consent for abortion services. While desirable for family
involvement in every young woman’s decision in life, this
is cruel. After an Indiana parental—consent bill was enacted,
a young woman, Becky Bell, self—induced an abortion
rather than obtain consent. Her parents now travel
throughout the country condemning consent legislation.

With the Supreme Court ready to overturn precedent,
this may not be the worst outcome. The abortion debate
must be settled once and for all. Over the past two years,
pro-choice people fought to encode the principles of Roe
in state law. In Washington and Nevada, pro-choice
initiatives won on referendum supporting safe and legal
abortion.

While it is unfortunate that basic women's rights must
be fought state by state, it will allow the majority of
Americans, who identify as pro-choice, to save women's
lives.

Posvafsfamasy world revisited

Walking across a well-travelled road, mindless of
the traffic, I beheld an incredible sight. Hoisted
upon the backs ofa multitude ofstruggling youths,
a great sedan carried a bloated monstrosity decked
with royal robes and ornate decorations; it
continuously belched out “Posvar.”

A sickening, gray hue radiated from the being’s
skin. But the glare of gold would probably blind any

fenced—in area that was not much more than a
pit. e ‘

“What was that?” ,

“Sorry, can’t talk,” chimed the first little guy. “If
we hurry, we won’t have to stand in line much
more than a day,” echoed the ‘second rather coldly.

“Wait! Why do you pay so much in this land of
Pitt? Why don’t you ask what you're paying for?

overhead. The three scurried
down the road, andl faced a man

Catching the gaze ofthe bright-
eyed old man, I found myself asking who he was.

“Posvar,” he croaked. “This land was mine, my
precious. But now someone else rules here, and I,
Posvar, I was asked to attend his
coronation.” A

He bent over towards me, crooked like a vulture,
and continued in a startled tone.

“Who has my precious? What is he doing with it?”
he asked. He raised his bushy eyebrows, burped
another “Posvar” and ordered his throng away.

Three small people overtook me; I figured them
to be guests for the inauguration of the new
president, but they seemed unhappy.

“Are you going to the grand ceremony?” I asked.

None of them knew what I was talking about.

“We go to pay our dues,” said the firstindifferently.
A companion counted money from an envelope
marked “from mommy and daddy.” The third leafed
through a pamphlet titled Tuition in Three Easy
Payments.

As we spoke, a group of lawyers dismantled a
peddler’s cart. Shirts and hats emblazoned with the
logo of the land ﬂew about.

“That’ll teach you to steal our name,” yelled a
lawyer clad in blue and gold.

Eventually the lawyers left; their pockets slowed
them ever so slightly. Down the street I noticed that
the other shops carried the symbol of the ever-
growing land’s ruler — all of them except for one

dressed in an expensive gray suit
and mounted on a great gray steed.

“I am the mouth of O’Connor. I hereby order you
to stop using the name of Pitt and inciting rebellion.
Cease and desist.” Before I could react, the man
rode away. V

“I can’t believe it!” I yelled. “Where’svthe Wizard?

Where’s the fellowship? Where’s the‘ little guy to

plunge the land of evil into destruction?”

“That Old Geezer got taken care of,” an unknown
voice spoke out.

“You mean  “ _

“He got paid off. Right now he’s doing research
for the military. He also teaches a huge class
through his assistants.”

“But he’s the greatest wizard on the planet!” I
cried. '

“Yeah. It’s a great boon to the Magic School of
Instant Recognition.”

“And the little guy?” «

“His uncle kept pestering him to go on some
crazy quest. But he said he had stuff to do. So his
uncle ended up leaving by himself. No one’s heard
a thing about him in months: But he was crazy,
always talking about elves and evil and action. Like
anyone could make a difference. You want to find
someone to change things? Don’t bother. No one
here cares about anything.”

Lady Panthers come from behind in 5- 53 victo

By Derek Willis
Sports Editor

The Pitt Lady Panthers weathered a shaky first
half and surged past Syracuse, 58-S3, last night at
Fitzgerald Field House.

Pitt raised its record to 8-12, 4-7 in Big East play,

and the Orangewomen fell to 7-13, 3-8.

With a few minutes left in the first period, Pitt
head coach Kirk Bruce took off his jacket, a bad
sign for his players. Pitt finished the half down
26-18 and shooting just 20 percent from the floor.

“I wanted to read them the riot act at halftime,”,

Bruce said. “But the things I talked about, they
weren’t crazy. Itwas just that we weren’t'hustling.”

Whatever Bruce said at the intermission seemed
to work, as renewed intensity and offensive
patience produced a second-half comeback for
the crucial win. The Lady Panthers scorched the
nets in the second half, hitting 61 percent of their
shots. At the same time, they limited Syracuse to
35-percent shooting. ’

Erin Maioy scored 15 points to lead Pitt, and her
performance was indicative of the way the game
went. Maloy missed all six of her shots before the
half, including five three-point shots. However it
was a completely different scenario in the last 20
minutes, when Maloy hit four of five treys, two of
them coming within 14 seconds of each other as
the Lady Panthers built an eight—point, second-
half lead.

“I thought we were doing the things to help
Erin in the second half,” Bruce said. “The other
team knows she’s going to be shooting threes.
We just got her open, and she was able to get her

‘feet planted.” »

Pitt wasted little time after coming out of the
locker room at intermission, cutting the eight-
point deficit down to two with 12:49 remaining.
Maioy then hit the first of her treys to give Pitt a
one-point lead. Syracuse’s Erin Kenneally, who
scored all of her 12 points in the second period,
took back the lead with a medium-range jumper
at the 12:07 mark.

But that was the final lead the Orangewomen
would enjoy. Five different Pitt players scored
the team’s next 10 points, interrupted only by two

Being in control oz priorizj/for swim team is Sullivan

By Brian Gallagher
Staff Writer

When athletes compare the
enjoyment they ‘get from
participating in their sports to
defying gravity, one gets the
impression that they have a
heartfelt passion for the sport.

Pitt swimmer Lau ra—Lee Sullivan
‘perfectly fits the profile of such

she gets from swimming" her
favorite event, the 100-yard
breaststroke.

“When I’m _ swimming
breaststroke and I’m swimming it
right, it feels like I’m flying,"
Sullivan said. “I love that feeling.
I’m looking forward to that feeling
of ﬂying through the water at Big
Easts.” _

Sullivan, a seven-time Big East
champion who specializes in the
breaststroke, will swim what is
likely to be the final meet of her
career at the Big East
Championships in two weeks.

While such eminent prospects
would cause others to “well up
inside” or getsentimental, Sullivan

is nothing short of exuberant"

when talking about it.

“Right now I’m so excited,”
Sullivan said. “No matter what I
do, I’m going to get on the block

knowing this is my last time, and
I’m gonna go all out.”

The Rochester, N.Y., native said
her ﬁnal collegiate school year
has been extremely satisfying,
due in large part to her ability to
pay attention to all phases of her

life.

“This year I’ve got it more
together because I’m focused on
school, I’m focused on swimming
and I have a good social life,”
Sullivan said. “I’m able to find
time for everything.”

This well—rounded life is
something that was missing from
her early years at Pitt, which -
like that of most students —-
Sullivan said were a bit hectic.

“My freshmen year I was so
cocky, in terms of an internal
attitude,” Sullivan said. “And my
sophomore year — while I still
had the unbeaten streak intact -
there were personal things that
made it tough.

“But this year it’s much different
than in my other years in that the
team is so much fun. And this
being my senior year, it’s so great
to have that,” Sullivan said.

“If I need people, they're there
for me,” Sullivan added, “and
that feels good.”

Though Pitt’s dual-meet record
(5-5) did not mirror previous
successful seasons, Sullivan said
she is encouraged about Pitt’s
chances as a team in the league
meet Feb. 20-23 at Trees Pool.

“After Christmas I was worried
about the team,” Sullivan said,
“but the way we swam for each
other against West Virginia [Pitt
won], I felt much better about our
chances."

The conference meet will hold
extra incentive for Sullivan, who

will attempt to recapture the 100-
yard breaststroke title, which she

held for two seasons. If that is to
happen, she will have to beat the
athlete who took the title from
her last year: Villanova’s Lisa
Flood. .

Flood, a 21-year-old
sophomore who is a member of
the Canadian National Team (and
probably Olympic team, too), is
the clear-cut favorite in the 100
breast. She recently set a Trees
Pool record in the event, and she
has been close to unbeatable all
year. Despite her opponent's
gaudy achievements, Sullivan is
not in awe of her competition.

“After the first time I swam
against her, I realized that she
wasn’t untouchable,” Sullivan
said. “This year is going to bea
differentstory. I’m not intimidated
by her title and status.”

While impressed by Flood, head
coach David Belowich said he
has no worries about Laura-Lee's
chances.

“You can’t control what
someone else does in the water,
only what you do,” Belowich
said. “Laura-Lee knows that, and
I think that when it’s meet time,
Laura-Lee can give her a race.”

Sullivan will also participate in
the 200-yard breaststroke and the
medley relay.

Winter Olympics kick off this weekend

Byjeremy Swarbrick
Staﬂ’ Writer

°It seems like just yesterday that they put out the torch in
Calgary, Alberta, site of the 1988 Winter Olympic games. Now,
four years later, they are ready to do it again — this time half way
around the world in a place called Albertville, a small, quiet town
nestled in the French Alps.lf you are an Olympic junkie, much as
myself (my friends know that only my girlfriend and the NCAA
tournament arouse this much excitement in me), then in front of
the television is where you will want to be for the next two weeks.
This year our friends at CBS will be broadcasting 116 hours of
Olympic coverage, which they so graciously paid $243 million
dollars for, over 16 days. But that is not all! If you have cable, TNT
is also adding 45 “bonus hours" of programming to supplement
even the most gluttonous couch potato’s appetite. .
Coverage of the opening ceremonies begins on CBS at 8 on
Saturday night and will run till about 11. CBS will return to
Albenville at 11:30 p.m. every night for a daily round-up show.
But even before the opening ceremonies take place, the games
will have begun. From 4 to 6 p.m. the same day, you will be able
to watch hockey and the men’s downhill—skiing and ski-jumping
practices. Get to sleep early Saturday night because it is early to
rise on Sunday morning. At 9 a.m., coverage of the men’s luge,
women’s cross-country skiing, hockey and freestyle skiing (ballet)
begins. Later in the day, beginning at 2 p.m., coverage will

resume with the men’s luge, ski jumping and women’s speed

skating. The U.S. Olympic hockey team will begin its quest to A
successfully defend its seventh-place finish, a distinction it has

earned in the two previous Games. They will take on not—so hockey
power Italy, From 8 to 11p.m., CBS will air men’s downhill skiing
and pairs figure skating.

During the weekdays, the programming schedule varies a bit
from the weekends. CBS will be airing the Olympics in the
following time slots: 7-9 a.m. and 8-11 p.m. This schedule will
continue for the entire Olympics. If your middays are free and you
have cable, TNT will broadcast from Albertville between 1 and 6
p.m. on weekdays throughout the Games. It has yet to announce
the events which it will be covering. In addition to the hockey,
skiing and ice skating, three new demonstration events have been
added to this year’s Games. '

The first is curling, which is of particular fancy in Canada and the
northern United States If you have never heard of this sport before,
do not worry. It resembles bowling and shuffleboard, only it is
played on ice. Interesting, eh? Another demonstration sport is
freestyle skiing. This competition is broken into two categories:
ballet and aerials. Youihave undoubtedly seen this event either on
ESPN or in any one of the numerous “skin ﬂicks” shot at ski resorts
that movie makers seem to think we enjoy.The ﬁnal demonstration
event is speed skiing. This is probably the craziest of all events, in
which skiers reach speeds in excess of 120 mph to see who is the
fastest. This event is a must-see. T

Syracuse free throws. Maloy
added her two three-pointers, and
Pitt led 46-35 with 7:27 left.

From that point, Syracuse
tightened up its defense and made
a charge, led by guard Karen
Zajick. Zajick, who was her team’s
leading scorer with 15 points and
five assists, scored four points in
a row. Suddenly the lead was
down) to five points at the 5:19
mark.

At that point, Pitt’sJill McElhinny
scored one basket and dished out
assists on two others to make the
lead a seemingly insurmountable
nine points. But Syracuse had
one more push. Five straight free
throws and a three-pointer by the
Orangewomen cut the margin to
52—51, with just over two minutes
left.

Forced to foul, Syracuse putjill
Colabrese on the line. The
sophomore converted two shots
to push the lead to three. After a
jumper by Syracuse center Shawn
Ziemba, Pitt guard Carol Morton
drove the baseline with 33 seconds
left, spun 180 degrees in the air
and banked home the shot for a
56-53 Pitt lead.

' Jonna Huemrich closed the
game with a pair of free throws
with 13 seconds left.

Huemrich scored 10 points and
pulled down 13 rebounds in her
37 minutes of play. She also
recorded four of Pitt’s 1] steals.
McElhinny had four points, four
assists and no turnovers for the
night. Her penetration into the
Orange’s zone defense and crisp
passing was instrumental in
keeping the Lady Panthers on
top. '

fobnson is‘ NBA All-Star game
appearance hardly magical

By George Klimis
For The Pitt News

This week has been full of
controversy, anticipation and
the like. Between Earvin
“Magic”Johnson’s appearance
in the NBA All—Star Game, the
start of the Winter Olympics
this weekend and Sean Miller’s
move into second place in all-
time Big Easteassists, I do not
know where to start.

First and foremost, this

whole Magic Johnson thing is
very confusing. Should he play
in the all—star game or not’ 1
think it comes down to a simple
question: Has Magic played
one game this season? No.
Then he should not play.
Charles Barkley, Michael
Jordan and David Robinson
have busted their butts this
season to be the best players
in the league, and as a reward
they get to play in this game.
And what about players like
Kevin Johnson and John
Stockton, whom Magic will be
starting instead of?

Sure, the fans elect the
players for the all—star game.
But using the baseball all-star
game as an example, fans have
shown in the past that they
only know how to vote for the
most popular players, not the
best ones. Even ex-Phillie great
and future Hall-of—Famer
Michael Jack Schmidt was

elected to the baseball all-star —

game after he retired, but he

did not play.

Maybe instead of Charles
Barkley calling Magic to ask
him to reconsider playing in
the all-star game, MichaelJack
could give Magic a ring.

I am not against Magic
playing in the game because
he is HIV positive. But is it fair
to other players who feel
uncomfortable playing with
someone who has the AIDS
virus? Mark Price of the
Cleveland Cavs said it best
when he noted that although
there is only a minute chance
that someone with the virus
can pass it to someone else on
the court, if someone were to
get the virus it would be one
chance too many.

On a lighter note, thank
goodness the ’92 Winter
Olympics are starting this
weekend.

What better way for sports
fans to get together and root
for the good ol’ U.S. of A? My
anticipation is great, especially
to see the U.S. men’s hockey
team open Sunday against Italy.
Maybe we will get a repeat of
the miracle in 1980 at Lake
Placid.

How sweet would it be if
our bobsled team upset the
Unified Germans and showed
those Japanese that we may
not make great cars, but we
make a mean bobsled?

And I don’t know if you’ve .

seen the latest in Olympic
events, but that speed skiing is

very exciting.

Being from Florida, I’m not too
into these wintersports, so maybe
in 1996 they can include boxing
in the Winter Olympics. And
maybe it is not too late for the site
of the ’96 Summer Olympics to
be switched from Atlanta to where
it belongs — Athens, Greece —
for the 100th anniversary of the
games.

Now back to the hardwood,
where Sean Miller continues to
show that he is one of the smartest
point guards in the country. With
eight assists against Miami, he
moved past Mark Jackson of St.

John’s. Miller now has 344 assists
in Big East play, 82 behind
Sherman Douglas of Syracuse.

Miller is the kind of point guard
National Championship teams are
made of. He is a greatballhandler,
great passer and deadly outside
shooter, and he barely misses his
foul shots. If my team had a
narrow lead with a minute to go,
I would want the ball in no one’s
hands but Sean Miller’s.

Another great thing about Miller ’
is that he rarely does stupid things,
like drive the lane against a seven-
foot giant. An example of that
would beJerry McCullough trying
to drive the lane against Alonzo
Mourning.

Hopefully Sean will teachJerry
a few things before his season
ends. And hopefully the Panthers
will play to their potential and
give Miller-one last chance in the
NCAA Tournament where he
belongs.

Sullivan  

Continued from page 7

Belowich’s confidence in
Sullivan is due in part to Sullivan's
conﬁdent attitude. It is an attitude
that Belowich can appreciate now
more than ever this season,
considering all the injuries and
departures the team has endured.

“She has a tremendous amount
of pride and faith and never looks
for excuses,” Belowich said. “Not
that her attitude wasn't good in
the past, but her presence is
really needed this year.”

Belowich said he thinks this
year's conference meet will be
Sullivan’s best opportunity to
return to the form she displayed
prior to her injury, like when she
was Big East Female Swimmer of
the Year in 1989.

"I think she’s about where she
was at her best, during her
freshman year," Belowich said.
He expressed encouragement
about her efforts recently against
Ohio University. “What impressed
me is how she split in the 400 IM.
She swam very well, basically
without breathing.”

Over the past two seasons, rest
and health have become rare for
the former high-school All-
American.Sullivan swam through
a pnful 1990-’91 campaign with a
knee injury, which required
surgery on March 1, 1991. Since
the surgery, she has spent time
rebuilding her left knee and
battling a recurring bout of
bronchitis — all kept her from
reaping the benefits of a full
taper.

Sullivan will get the chance to
rest and gain her strength back
before the meet. The combination
of tapering, shaving and health
should combine for a memorable
curtain callfor one of Pitt’s best
breaststroke specialists.

With the end of her collegiate
career just weeks away, Sullivan
said she can’t wait to get on with
the rest of her life.

“I'm so excited to get on with
the rest of my life — to be on my

own and out of school,” Sullivan *

said.
Sullivan will graduate this spring
with a degree in communications.

Wrestlers travel to Lehigh

By Rob Pugliese

Senior Sports Writer .

It will be a homecoming of sorts for three Pitt wrestlers this
Saturday, when the Panther wrestling team travels to Lehigh
University for a tri—meet with Lehigh, California University of
Pennsylvania and Drexel.

All-American Scott I-lovan, Jeff Kloiber and I)ave Connors all
hail from the Lehigh Valley. Hovan and Kloiber are from
Allentown, while Connors comes from Nazareth. 'Ihe hometown
fans will get a look at a red-hot Hovan, ranked sixth in the
nation, while Kloiber is coming offa dynamite pin that helped
propel Pitt past Bloomsburg, 21-20, last Saturday.

The Panthers should fare very well against California and
Drexel, but head coach Rande Stottlemyer said he expects a stiff
test from Lehigh.

“If they match up right with you, they can whip you,”
Stottlemyer said. “We don't match up real well in a couple of
classes.”

Stottlemyer will adjust his lineup slightly for Lehigh, with
Hovan (17-3) wrestling at 167 rather than 158 and Sean Gibbs
(16-6) moving up to 177. Both wrestlers will face tough
opponents, but Stottlemyer’s aim is to prime his wrestlers for
the IZWL and national tournaments.

Another key matchu p will be at the 118-pound weight class,
where junior Bobby Simpson looks to rebound from a tough
loss against Bloomsburg’s Tim Casey.

Simpson (3-2-1) is still searching to regain his form of two
years ago, and he said he feels it will only return with more
bouts under his belt.

With EWIs only a month away, Stottlemyer is stressing to his
wrestlers the importance of being focused. Stottlemyer said he
believes a focused Panther squad will equal three victories this
weekend.

“We’re aiming for the end, aiming for that EWL tournament,” '

he said.

Syracuse gets away with murder

-Why does it seem that

5 Syracuse has papal authority over

the world of basketball? The
Syracuse program has been under
scrutiny for some time now, so
I’m not here to conveniently join
in the bashing but to simply ask
how does it get away with all of
this?

The NCAA took away Conrad
McRae’s eligibility in December
because Syracuse supposedly had
an unfair advantage in recruiting
him. After two weeks of appeals
and whining from the SU
community, the NCAA restored
McRae’s eligibility. Big surprise
there. Most players have no prayer
of winning an appeal after an
investigation like this, but
Syracuse had no problem.

The Orange kingdom was again
filled with felicity and bliss, and
Jim Boeheim’s boys promptly
marched into the national
rankings. Weeks later, McRae
ca me back with an
unprecedented lawsuit against the
NCAA. In the $1.35 million suit,
McRae alleges that he suffered
damage to his reputation and lost
valuable national-television
exposure by having to sit out two
games. Did it ever dawn on McRae
that Marty Blake and his NBA
scouting staff have no interest in

L adies only?‘ 5 ” Weeks

Rob
Pugliese

a 6-foot, 10-inch underachiever
who produces eight points and
five boards per game? Well, OK,

he can block a couple shots

because of his leaping ability and
long arms but not because of
anything as valuable as solid
defensive positioning or anything.

We’re talking Syracuse here.

I lose sleep at night because
McRae missed out on more
opportunities to talk trash and
taunt his opponents on national
television. That’s the main reason
I watch Big Monday. Every fan
waits to see McRae’s one garbage
dunk and token blocks. His finest
asset is his penchant for
disappearing during crunch time.
Watching McRae makes Bobby
Martin look like the model of
consistency.

-The Orangemen have been
playing decent ball, but they can
attribute two conference wins
largely to poor officiating. Against
St. -John’s, their winning
possession was set up by David
Johnson’s save of a loose ball
headed out of bounds. The only
problem was Johnson’s footwas
already on the sideline, and
everyone in upstate New York
knew it. On Monday night the
Orange and Connecticut were
deadlocked at 85 with :19
remaining, when Johnson came

from behind Rod Sellers and
slapped the ball through Sellers’
hands, out of bounds. Syracuse
was awarded possession, and for
once Huskie Coach Jim Calhoun
had reason to holler.

The Orange missed two shots,
and who else but McRae went up
for a third chance. Three seconds
left, and the zebras whistled a
shaky foul on UConn. (McRae
might consider a career in the
performing arts since hoops hasn’t
worked out.) And how timely?
Not only did the refs whistle the
foul, but McRae was “injured” on
the play and had to leave the
game.

Nothing to do with the fact that
he’d lose a free-throw shooting
contest to the Nets’ Chris Dudley.
Boeheim brought in Mike
Hopkins, another weak shooter
but clutch in the late minutes. He
hit one of two, and the Orange
won 84-83. McRae’s “injury” must
not have been too severe because
he reentered the lineup after
Hopkins’ second free throw to
deﬂect UConn’s final, desperation
pass. Syracuse’s trainer could be
certified as a miracle worker after
that.

-.--With Johnson, first—year
phenom Lawrence Moten and
Adrian Autry, Syracuse could give
people ﬁts in a three—on-three
tournament. But unfortunately for
them, come March‘, it’s still five
on five, and there are too many
glaring weaknesses (no center,
no bench) for Syracuse to survive‘
the" second round of the NCAAs.

Yhree Sisters explores futility of the human condition

By Jenna Ferrara
News Editor

They’re obsessed with wanting
what they think they can't have,
and oblivious to the control they
could exert over their own lives.
They are silently foundering in
the despair they have created
themselves —— but that doesn’t
make the pain any less real.

And they want, more than
anything else, to go to Moscow.

Chekhov’s brilliant studies of
the turn-of—the-century Russian
“idle rich” are just as pertinent to
the United States of l992 as they

I were when first produced.
Accenting the rniscommunication
and desperation inherent in
human life, the Pittsburgh Public
Theater presents Three Sisters,
Corinne Jacker’s modernized
adaptation of Chekhov’s drama.

The play opens with the
birthday celebration of the
glowing, often silly Irina (Susan
Coon), the youngest of the three
sisters. The decay of the Prosorov
sisters’ household is imminent,
and they wander, bored, inside
its walls, half-expecting their fate.
“I must work,” Irina decides in
the first act, by way ofan answer.

Three Sisters is a portrait of the eternal
human problem of wanting rather than
doing. Their dreams are within reach,
but we (and they) eventually realize that
even if they had what they wanted, it
probably wouldn’t make them happy.

 ”

After playing at work for a few
years, she realizes that labor isn't
the answer either— it is physically
draining and often dehumanizing.
“There will be a time when we
will find a reason for all this,” the
middle sister Masha wails in
exhausted despair near the end
of the play.

Caryn West is appropriately
officious as Olga, the oldest
and understandably’ world-
weary sister. Nothing less than
magniﬁcent is Helena Ruoti as
dour, forthright and intricate
Masha, completely in love with
Vershinin (Kenneth Meseroll),

military commander.

Solyony is a sardonic, sneering
soldier with a weight of love in his
awkward heart, and Kevin Donovan
neatly portrays these underlying
contradictions.

Catherine Butterfield skillfully
handles Natasha's descent from
benign bumbler to evil dowager,
and Eugenia Rawls is moving as
Anfisa, the wizened, always faithful
maid, trapped as securely in her
wasted role as the Prosorovs are in
theirs.

As the kind, stodgy pedagogue
Kulygin, Larry john Meyers
demands empathy along with the
laughter that comes with his sternly
delivered lines such as “C~minus
for conduct,” to his spirited wife
Masha. Meyers’ performance, all
grace under pressure, is clearly one
of the best in the show.

William Gardner's direction is
smooth and controlled, deftly
positioning the characters to reflect
their complex relationships Laura
Crow’s costumes work well‘ with
Charles McCarry’s authentic set,
which is accented by framed
photographs, representing fading
memories, hanging over the
characters’ heads.

They are enveloped by languor,
paralyzed by inaction. Three Sisters
is a portrait of the eternal human
problem of wanting rather than
doing.

Their dreams are-within reach,
but we (and they) eventually realize
that even if they had what they
wanted, it probably wouldn’t make
them happy. '

And they never get to Moscow.

THE PITI‘ NEWS, Thursday, February 6, 1992

By Alon Orstein
Smﬂ Writer

Bugsy Siegel. The name had
ﬂitted across my consciousness
in the past. I knew the dude was
a gangsta, sounded Jewish,
probably grew up down around
Hester or Delancey Street on the
Lower East Side. Visions of
Richard Grieco, Mo Gren and
Katz Delicatessen danced in my
head as I made way to the movie
theater. I didn’t quite know what
to expect. on one side you’ve got
bad boy Warren Beatty. (Hooray
for Hollywood.) On the other,
hot pastrarni, the beautiful Annette
Bening and a slick cast of
peripherals. And Barry Levinson
in tha middle.

Flick opens on Benjamin _(don’t
call him Bugsy or he'll smoke ya)
Siegel’s gang—banging ‘round-

Manhattan circa 1940. Things take .

an interesting twist when boyz
Lucky Luciano and Meyer Lansky
send Ben out to Los~Angeles in
the hope of homing in on some
fertile West Coast operations. The
low-key New York crowd gets
more than it bargained for,
however, when the ostentatious
Siegel takes a bit too quickly to
the Hollywood glitter. Most
glaring is a turbulent love affair
with a young, arrogant actress
named Virginia Hill (Bening).
The story twists and turns

playfully for awhile around’

Benjamin's criminal exploits and
the on-again, off—again
relationship. Things come to a
head when, on an unassuming,
dusty, desert day, Siegel has a
revelation. He envisions an oasis
in the Nevada wasteland —- a
glitzy gambling resort town where
rollers of all shapes and sizes
could come and lose their money
legitimately. We bear witness to
the immaculate conception. Ahhh
 the birth of Las Vegas. From
here we follow the frenetic pursuit
of Siegel’s dream, which leads
(as all gangsta ﬂicks do) to his
eventual downfall. 0

First off, if you don’t like Beatty,
this film is obviously not for you.
He quickly falls into his trademark
emotionally wrought/naughty-

boy niche, made famous in ‘A

Bonnie And Clyde. In this role,
he assumes a weird sort of a
hybrid kind of cross between
Vincent Van Gogh and Idi Amin
that is rather alluring. Though
less ﬂat than Bening, he does
have some trouble — particularly
with the hardcore stuff. As the
vanity-stricken and vulnerable
wiseguy, Beatty scores. From
wild-eyed Las Vegas fantasies to

Two jazz vets and one
newcomer score large

Bebop and Beyond
Plays Dizzy Gillespie
Mesa/Bluemoon

Nobody plays like Dizzy
Gillespie. That's why when the
San Francisco-based group Bebop
8: Beyond decided to do a tribute
album to the Diz, it had the great
one sit in on the project and show
the way. The result is another
stunning recording from one of
the most dynamic jazz bands
around.

The first Bebop 8: Beyond
album paid respect to Thelonius

Monk by redoing a number ofhis
obscure songs. Bebop 8: Beyond
is an atypical jazz band which
can sound like a big band holding
sway or a tight trio at a sleepy bar.
The reason for this is the
arrangements by Mel Martin,
saxophonist and musical director
for B & B. For this session, Martin
decided on a variety of Gillespie
tunes and some that are not Diz’s
but sound like they are. Martin
deals out plenty of time for solos,
and the impressive chops belong
to pianist George Cables, guitarist
Jeff Vincent and Martin, himself

The inspiration and the director: Dizzy Gillespie and Mel Martin.

(and Dizzy, of course).

The arrangements for the eight-
pieee band. and Dizzy are
impeccable, considering the range
of the songs. Gillespie plays on
six of the eight tunes and sings on

THE PI'I'I‘ NEWS, Thursday, February 6, 1992 

(Do Not Disturb),” is also of the
bop variety and very lively. The
guitar of Vincent is outstanding
here and elsewhere.

The rest of the songs are also
fine, with the possible exception

all but lays out and allows Dizzy to
work his magic. One other tune
which is fun to hear is the rare

' “Diddy—Wa—Diddy. ”

' This recording is a monument to
the artistic efforts of onejohn Birks

one. Among the highlights is the
opener, “Wheatleigh Hall,” a

of the Gillespie standard, “Con
Alma,” which is a bit overdone

Gillespie, known as Dizzy, and it
certainly reconfirms his place

here. The one selection which ‘
features Dizzy’s vocals, “I Waited
For You,” was his big-band
theme some 50 years ago. Here,
Diz proves just as capable

blazing tune which is pure, fiery
bop. Next up is a medley of
Martin’s “A Night in Nazca” and
Diz’s “Manteca.” Within the large
group, the Latin sounds and

among the legends of 20th-century
music —— as if it was ever in doubt.
At 73, Dizzy.Gillespie still has what
many musicians spend years
searching for: that exquisite

Charles Fambrough
The Proper Angle
Mesa/Bluemoon

Imagine a bass player who has
toured with and written for Art
Blakey and McCoy Tyner and
also incorporated heavy Latin
characteristics into his music. The
equation adds up, somewhat, in
The PmperAngle, the first effort
from bassist Charles Fambrough.

Fambrough surrounds himself
with a tremendous supporting
cast, including Branford and
Wynton Marsalis, Kenny Kirkland
and Roy Hargrove. While the
soloing is excellent throughout,
the overall impression is one of
dryness.

Some of Fambrough’s songs,
namely “One For Honor” and
“Broski,” are great, hard, bop
tunes, but some of the others
(“Don Quixote” and “The
Dreamer?) seem to lag behind in
energy and complexity. Without
the efforts of. pianist Kirkland,
some of these songs would sound
downright boring.

Fambrough wants to capture a
Latin feel on many tunes, and his
choice of instruments accomp-

lishes this. Soprano saxophonist _

Joe Ford ﬁts nicely into the scheme
here but lacks some of the
rhythmic elements which make
Latin jazz exciting. At times it
seems that Fambrough and his
mates are uncertain of the path
they want to take.When this group
wants to play inspired music, it is
fully capable of it. The Blakey
inﬂuence is felt, but not enough.
Individually, Fambrough is a
very clean instrumentalist who
plays with a great deal of
confidence. Kirkland is also a
gem on this session; check out
the final cut, “The Tonality of
Atonement,” as an example.
Overall, this is not a bad first
effort for Fambrough. His skill
brings hope for future projects.
However his writing still seems
to lack a definitive style; he seems

The Walter Norris Quartet
Sunburst
Concord Jazz

This is the type of band you’d
want to hear on a Sunday
afternoon—— tight, emotional, but
not overbearing, with plenty of
experience playing as a unit.
Veteran piano man Walter Norris

leads this refreshing nine-song
set by being exceedingly
conscious of his fellow mates:
Joe Henderson on tenor, Larry
Grenadier on bass and Mike
Hyman on drums. Within that
circle, Henderson is the star,
although Norris is big in his own
right. For proof, check out his
solo work as part of the Maybeck
Recital Hall series.

The songs for this session are
stellar. They include three Norris

“Naima” or Parker’s “Bird,” which
keep the theme alive while
making a personal statement on
behalf of the current musicians.
Throughout this session I was
struck by the fact that the music
was so appealing without having
any displays of out—of-this—world
technical facility or frenetic
tempos. The simple fact is that
this quartet doesn’t need to
literally blow people away to
make an effect. Sure, this lacks
the raw emotional fury of a
Coltrane date, but it still swings
mightily and joyously. And that is
a very appreciable talent.

iF FOR SPRING BREAK!!

1:ceptive Wording Can Ruin YourTrip
N BE WARE

Here is a letter from a Pitt Student who took
one of those “Other Trips” last year:

I am writing this letter so that other Pitt students will become more
. informed about Spring Break trips. Last year, for spring break, myself and
r "‘ three of my friends each signed up for a trip to Daytona Beach, Florida,
? through a company called (we can’t release the name in this ad), which is
based in Canada. Through my experience I have discovered that this
“organization” is one big joke. 0

Originally our bus was to depart from the William Pitt Union, on March 2 -
Saturday — at 12:00 noon. However, I received a call late Thursday night on 0
January 31 from a man named Dave from (the same travel company), whom
I had never met. He called to inform our group that our bus was being re-

_, routed to Clarion, Pa. and that’s where we would board. We were all ticked
I I " off, but already paid our money so we made arrangements to drive to
Clarion. However, Friday, March 1, I called (the same travel company) to
check on our bus, only to find out it had already left. He assumed that I S
understood he meant Friday, when he messed up and told us March 2.

Basically, (this travel company) screwed us royally. Luckily we were able
to get the last seats on a bus to Daytona from the Pitt Program Council. All
of the people from the Pitt Program Council were teriffic and really went out
of their way to help us out. The fact that you can meet them face to face
and find out all of the details really makes planning a piece of cake.

The Pitt Program Council is going to Panama City Beach, Florida this year,
and my friends and I are already signed up. My advice to any Pitt student
who wants to take an awesome trip to Florida is to go talk to the Program
Council. The office is M-30 in the William Pitt Union or call 648-7900.

with the bass real high in the mix.
Featuring bluesy, cocky vocals
from Baiza (“I’m five years ahead
of my time”), it almost reminds
me of Little Feat — but in a
campy way.

Aside from the tight rhythm
section and Baiza’s guitar licks,
the highlight is the clean, fresh
tenor sax of veteran Steve Moss.
Moss, Baiza and Fitzer all worked
together in the mid-’80s in the
improvisational, random, spoken-
word group Saccharine Trust.
Moss and Baiza have been the
propelling forces behind UCO
since its inception.

UCO, like most jazz-based
outfits, likes to dabble in covers.
This record is no exception. In
past efforts, the group has tackled
Ornette Co1eman’s “Law Years,”
Willie Dixon’s “Mellow Down
Easy” and James Blood Ulmer’s
“Hightime.” This time UCO gets
after Ronald Shannon Jackson’s
“Small World” with vigor. A slap-
happy movin’ bass sets the rhythm
for Moss’ free tenor blowing, as
his sax weaves in and out of
Baiza’s guitar noises. UCO also
attacks multireedman Henry
Threadgill’s “Bermuda Blues,”
adding soulful ﬂavor to the cut.
The record’s third cover is from
the Max Roach saxophonist
Odean Pope catalog, “Kyle’s
Theme.”

UCO takes its sound to new
levels on its latest effort. Moving
fully into the “Downtown” scene
of avant-jazz, UCO adds a lot of
R&B ‘funk to its near-art-rock
sound. The melodic intertwining
of Baiza’s guitar and Moss’ tenor
is evident throughout, but on
tracks like “Tight Beat,” in which
Baiza rips off some Marc Ribot-
like licks and Moss follows
perfectly with his sweet tenor,
UCO shows that it can play with
any of the New York big boys.

Baiza also grabs the mike on
some cuts. “Marginal” is a head-
nodding number with Baiza

Mystical idealism and spiritualism on MTV

By Brian Berger

Sbowcase Editor

I know this used to be Rico’s
territory, but these are really
desperate times.

Plus Rico is now a night
manager, obviously on to bigger
and better thangs. "

That enormous cable network/
music—video show is also movin’

~ up, at least in concept.

MTV: Major (-label)
Television.

What’s with these new hosts
they got?

Steve Isaacs, with his blatantly
dyed black hair and desperate
need for a shower, screams MTV
sellout. _

Nirvana went to No. 1, so the
boyz at MTV said, “Hey, let’s get
someone who looks like a Seattle
grunger.”

And then there's Karen Bryant,
another member of the grunge
generation, from the opposite
race — a true symbol of the
upcoming revolution MTV subtly
promotes. .

But while I’m not particularly
fond of these individuals, I have
to give props for the image they
portray.

Hell, if Nirvana is the new Top
10, I'm with it.’

While MTV plugs the positive
in its on-air spots, urging people
to vote and preaching about the

environment, it’s still tied into_
that damnedpoppressive system

determined by advertising (i.e.
dollars and no sense).

So itremains agreatbig enigma _.

flashed across the country for all
to see — in one minute ﬂashing
a new, liberal value structure at
us and in the next conforming to
the commercial sequence.

But the bottom line is whether
or not the videos MTV plays are
A) good music, B) the video as
entertainment, C) both orD) none
of the above.

So it’s time to run down some
videos and see what the deal is.
I’m not talking specialty-show
videos or unplugged videos. I
mean the stuff it runs all day and,
in this case, all-night.

Seal: “Killer” —— This week’s
ever-heralded MTV Breakthrough
video. Seal is a large, braided
man who sounds like Lenny
Kravitz (not in voice.— in style)
and looks like Mutabaruka.

He looms large in this vid, as he
spins and dances around a whole,
big, spiritual, new-age, positive-
thinking collection of crap my
mom used to be into: Escher
paintings elevated; a big, blue
world-ball whizzing around.
Shocking enough, there's even
some Yin and Yang symbols.

It actually looks like something
out of Return Of The Jedi at times.

At others it resembles a really
bad portrayal of a P—Funk record
cover

The whole thing makes me
want to discover all of my past
lives.

U2: “Mysterious Ways” — I
don’t watch a lot of MTV, but
somehow I end up watching a lot
of this video.

It’s another in the new line of

mystical videos with its shots of
Israel, the Wailing Wall, belly
dancing and snakes. Then it has
' the nice camera work that makes
the quad look like it’s in th
mirror room at Kenn-ywoocl, but
the spirit returns and we see
snakes and Bono lying on a lot of
floors, walls and other things at
some very weird angles.
It’s so middle eastern it makes
me want to make reservations at
Ali Baba.

Michael Jackson: “Remem-

plugging the making of this video,
it’s also offering the chance to
winwa-gdate with Michael: a nice,

i intimate gathering, good for a girl
or a boy. 1 ’

He'll cook you dinner or
something. This video ranks real
low on the all—time Michael list.
It’s. only ﬁve minutes long and
really lacks the glitz and glamour
of his previous,. blown—out-of-
proportion attempts.

how to do anything creative,
Mikey saves the day with some

again wears some of the ugliest

some type of skirt that goes along
with his cake face.

Yet he still excites Iman, and
he doesn't even dance all that

THE PITI‘ NEWS, Thursday, February 6, 1992

 

Bugsy
Continued from page S-3
an assassination plot against
Mussolini, Warren’s comic stuff is
dope. But in the end, as with
many of today's lead dudes, I
found myself mixing up the
names: Beatty. No, Bugsy. No,

Beatty. Wait a second.

In Bening the relationship
crashes, despite the well-
publicized off—screen antics.
Though her basic body english is
superb, she just doesn’t have a lot
of script to work with.
Interminable outbursts and triter
machinations solidify a one-

‘ dimensional status.

A goose egg in‘
development department has the
character stale after the first act.
Late in the flick last—minute
transformations become absurd.
There is no progression in the
couple’s interaction, no
movement other than a steady
string of reiterations. Pacino and
Pfeiffer have little to fear; this
ain’t no Scarface.

Directorally speaking, Levinson
is solid. Well-shot and edited, the
film takes on a real 1azy.’40s feel.
— from the mythic Melrose sets‘
to the tawdry West Hollywood
night clubs.

Silky, long silhouettes behind
movie screens, windows and
various other dividers frame the
action nicely, forming unnerving
yet compelling veils. Supporting
stars shine through, with Harvey
Keitel as the foul—mouthed Mickey
Cohn, Ben Kingsley as the
nefarious Meyer Lansky and
{believe it or not) the return of
Elliot Gould!

So does this ﬁlm deserve the
fawning it received from the L.A.
Critics’ Circle? No. Does this film
deserve a nod at the big dance?
See ya.

Ben Siegel would have told it
like it is: basic Hollywood stuff —
fun to look at, mildly satisfying
and lots of funky filler.'Sounds
like that hot pastrami sandwich
at Katz’s.

Rock Challenge

By Tonya Hurley
For The Pitt News

The finalists for the I.C. Light Rock Challenge
’92 are waiting in the wings to rock Graffiti in
Oakland. The competition will take place over
five consecutive Fridays, starting tomorrow.
Brought to you by Next Big Thing Productions,
the finalists that will go head to head tomorrow
night are Seventh House, The Works, The
Sleeze Band and Trip Hammer.

_On Feb. 14, Chill Factor, Andrea Pearl Band,
Greg Bowman and Silver Rado will compete.
Feb. 21 will feature Nixon Clocks, The
Distractions, Groove Gurus and The Knobs
battling it out. And finally, on Feb. 28, Tom and
Frayed, Cat Ballou, Toy Pony and Total Emotion
will duke it out.

One band will be chosen each week to go on
to the finals, which will take place on March 6.
The winner will receive 60 hours in a recording

s-11  

comes to Graffiti

studio, printing and releasing of_ S00-CD and
500-cassette packages. The second-place band
will receive 30 hours in the studio. Third place
receives a gift certificate from Hollowood Music,
and fourth place gets $100 cash.

Last year’s winner was a band that is familiar
with the Pittsburgh music scene ——- Shiloh,
which now goes by the name Bill Deasy Band.
“The bands in the past have gotten a lot out of
it, like other gigs,” Dana Resciniti of Next Big
Thing Productions said.

The judges will vary from week to week. But
mainly they will come from local radio stations,
record companies or the media. The I.C. Light
Rock Challenge provides an opportunity for
local bands to show their stuff. “It gives a big
boost to the local-music scene,” Resciniti said.

This is the event of the year for musicians to
get noticed. In order to attend this rock
extravaganza, you must be 21 or older. The
competitions start at 9 pm.
