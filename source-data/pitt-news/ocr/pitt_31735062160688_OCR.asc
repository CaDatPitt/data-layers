Constitutior

238 to 69

Proposed constitution for
the Student Government As-
sociation was accepted by the
students of the University by

V a vote of 238 to 69 last Mon-
day. .

SGA will succeed Student Con-
gress as the official student gov-
.j.ng organization.

In a written statement Presi-

dent Philip Parkinson ex-
pressed the following senti-
ments.

“It is with a great deal of satis-
faction that I officially announce
that the proposed constitution of
the University of Pittsburgh SGA
has passed the student referen-
dum.

“I am conﬁdent that in years
to come this constitution will
be :1 signiﬁcant factor in the es-
tablishment of a truly strong-
and‘ totally effective student

government.

‘fThe students of the University
of Pittsburgh should be congratu-
lated for the faith they have plac-
ed in this document.” '

Under th new organization
men student will no longer elect

sentatives to SGA will fulﬁll their

IFC Considering
Dissolving Council

As Unnecessary '

BY MILLARD AMDUR

,, Art Bloom, Bus. Ad. ’59, has
proposed to Interfraternity Coun-
cil that this organization be abol-
ished at the meeting of last Wed-
nesday evening.

Bloom, IFC representative to
Student Congress, believes that
the Council of Fraternity Presi-
dents can serve in the same func-
tion as present IFC.

Implicit in such a program, is
internal election among the fra-
ternity" presidents for the L officers
of the new interfraternity govern-‘
ment. ' ‘  " "

IFC, claimed that this plan is not
necessarilythe opinion of the ex-
ecutive committee of Interfrater-

‘nity Council. Bloom is of the op-
inion that “such a program is
feasible for this year.”

An individual study is to be
conducted by the Council of Fra-
ternity Presidents in conjunction

with the executive committee of’

IFC within the next three weeks.
IF elections were moved back to
March 24 in order that the study
may be completed.

A basic change was adopted in,-

relation to IFC judiciary commis-
sion. Under the new set_up, each
fraternity is allowed to nominate
one member from any one class.
Only one member from any in-

‘sdividual fraternity is allowed to
serve on the IFC judiciary.

No proposal for the use of Pitt Stadium has been pre-

Chancellor said last week. “If they are, I don‘t know when

it will be.”

He added that he has never talked to anyone from the

“Out of This World” will be the

At 3 p.m. he will speak at the

After his speech at the Union,
there will be an informal coffee

Dr. Ley was born in Berlin,

Spring Enrollment
Shows Decrease

A preliminary report on the
spring semester enrollment
released by Dr. Charles H.
Peake, assistant chancellor
for student affairs, shows a
total net campus registration
of 14,748.

A comparison of this prelimin-
ary report with the ﬁnal report for
the spring semester of 1957 when
the campus enrollment totaled 15,-
649 shows a decrease of 901 stu-
dents, or 5.7 per cent. V‘

Dr. Peake said’ that a reduced

number’ was ’ anticipated this
spring because of the’ increase
in tuition and the general rais-
.ing of standards. ~ .

A study’ of the figures shows an
increase of 4.6.per cent in part-
time -undergraduate students this
spring ‘as ’ compared with the
spring of 1957. This larger per-
centage of part-time students,
particularly in the undergraduate
area, indicates that a number of
students are carrying reduced
course loads this semester.

Increases in full time enroll-
ment are reported in the School
of Education, 5.5 per cent; Den-

tistry, 4.7 per cent; and Public

‘all the Stadium discussion.

Litchiield, in commenting on
the decision he would have to
make when and if a formal pro-
posal is made, stated, “My de-
cision might be quick, otherwise
it could take a week to ten days,
dc) ~nding on what the proposal
is.” ‘

Continuing on the subjhct of
whether he will receive a propos-
al, the Chancellor revealed that
he is of the opinion that when
the request for use of the Stadi-,-in
actually comes it will not be for
the.Steelers alpne.

“My guess is I’ll never hear
from the Steelers. My impression
is there is more than the Steelers
involved. I think the proposal will
be for the; Stadium’s use as a
civic stadium to be used tempor-
arily until the municipal stadium
is built.” a

He does not think that the
University’s okay on the use of
the Stadium would slow down
current efforts toward construc-
tion of a City-owned ﬁeld. “We
wouldn’t give them the Stadium
if it would slow up the construc-
tion. We musn’t take action to
retard it. We need a municipal
stadium.”

Concerning the tax problemin-_

volved, the Chancellor said’ he
does not know how serious it is.
He said that lawyers are currently‘
working on the problem.

“If the Steelers rented the Sta-

dium, we’d have a tax; if it is used

as a civic stadium, a tax is doubt-
ful,” he remarked.

Litehﬁeld was asked if he
thinks the City would be willing
to go along with the University
on two items if use of the Sta-
dium is given. These are im-

’ proved ‘parking’ facilities and

sale of Bigelow Blvd.‘ between

Need Financial Backing
Chancellor Tells Alumni

By NAT MARYN

“We have asked the students to contribute, and they have
done so in the form of increased tuition,-” said Chancellor Ed-

ward Litchﬁeld in a report to the Century Club last week.
1 He said that alumni, the City, State, private and business
interests must do what the students have already done to pro-
vide the ﬁnancial backing for further improvement and ex-

pansion of the University.

Henning Webb Prentis, Jr.
Chai-rman of the Board of Arm-
strong Cork Company followed
the Chancellor’s report with an
adress on “The Stake of Business
in Higher Education.”

The Century Club is a group
of alumni who give special sup-
port to the University. They
meet annually to celebrate the

, founding of the University.

The Chancellor said that ﬁnan-
cial problems are only : part of
the difﬁculties faced oy the Uni-
versity.

Other problems include bct‘er
library facilities, an improved
Physica‘ Education Department,
better recognition of faculty ac-
complishments, lighter teaching
loads, better deﬁnition of full
and part-time instructors and a
much improved Law School...

‘‘ He also cited the varied accom-

.» plishments of the past. year which

includes $42 million advance in
“capital planning.”

This includes r-‘ny buildings
and facilities that the Univers-
ity has begun to use in the past
year and much further plan-
ning still on the drawing boards.

Also acccomplished in the past

year were the creation of new
positions and a graduate school,
and the ﬁlling of administrative
and other va-.lncies. The nine new
members 0 fthe University family
were introduced to the alumni
group.
Litchﬁeld surveyed other gen-
eral developments" of the past
year which include bringing the
faculty into the ﬁeld of admini-
strative planning and trying to
solve the problems -which the
new trimester system has cre-
ated. 
Litchﬁeld also said that the
University is working to create a
better coordination between high
school and higher education.
Another general development
of the past year has been an
increase in faculty salaries‘ of
20% and an increase of fringe
beneﬁts of 661%. This has been
done to keep present faculty
with the‘ University and to
compete for other faculty, he
said. A
He said that as a result of the
economic cycle and the present
recession more scholarships and
fellowships must be made avail-
able to enable students to get their
needed education next year.

said. Then he added, “I don’t
think one should put it on a basis
such as this. If we get it (Bigelow
Blvd.), and eventually we will
have to, we will get it on merits of
need, not trade. We will decide
the Stadium issue, too, on its own
merits.”

Since Litchﬁeld met with the
representatives of the NCAA on
Feb. 19, he has discussed the sit-
uation with quite a few people.
“Everyone I meet wants to talk
about it,” he observed.

He said that he has also met
with the chairman of the ath-
letic committee, the athletic

committee of the Board of 'l‘rus- .

tees as well as other members
of the Board, faculty groups,
and Park Martin, special con-
sultant to the Chancellor on
campus development. ,
Litchﬁeld stated that he has
Athletic Director Tom Hamilton's
opinion on the proposal, but de-
clined to reveal what it is. Hamil-
ton, it is said in local athletic cir-
cles, is against the Steelers’ use 01
the Stadium.

The Chancellor Twas asked-’

whether he thought that the man-
ner in which Mayor David Lawr-
ence brought thepproposal out in
the open immediately - hindered
the discussions and eventual de-
cision in any way. a
1 He replied that the Mayor
was right in doing this. He
said, “There are so many peo-
ple involved that it is better for
everyone to have it discussed in
the open.”
He also commented‘ upon the
recent editorials of the city news-

papers. “It’s important to know
what the public feels. We are an
integral part of this community —-
the city, county, and region. We
should not ignore opinion express-
ed in this way.”

Chancellor Litchﬁeld doubts
that th e Pittsburgh Pirates
would eventually ask to use the
stadium. “The Stadium isn’t
big enough for a Major League
"ﬁeld. You’d have to knock out
part of L the Stadium, and I
don’t think the Pirates are pre-
pared to pay the cost.”

with the same spot again this sea-
son. From all indications it will be
mainly a two team battle between
Army and Penn State. However,
the Lions will have the advantage
of competing in their own gym-
nasium. .

A crowd of 5500 is expected
to view the ﬁnals at Recreation
Hall on Saturday. “Usually ev-
ery gym event is a sell out up

The Panthers’ Tom Darling will

defending his ﬂying ring
championship that he won at Navy
last year.He has been undefeated
so far this season. Darling also
competes on the high bar and is
rated very high in that event too.

Hammond Competes
Jim Mulvihill, John Hammond,
and Don Neeld are the Blue and
Gold’s main hopes to add addi-
tional points to the local cause.
Mulvihill, if he hits on his diffi-
cult routine, stands an excellent
chance of winning the high bar.
Hammond, who underwent a
knee operation between seasons,
will compete on the rings, paral-
lel bars, and possibly in tumb-
ling. Last season he competed
in the all events, but because
of his knee, he will be unable
to do so this campaign.
/Neeld captured seven ﬁrsts in
dual meet competition this year.

for top

However, his routine may not be
difficult enough to get the nod of
the judges. Neeld is also a valu-
able man in the rings in that he
starts the ringmen on their rou-
tine.

p All-Around Event Open M

The all-around event is a wide
open affair this year. Top candid-
dates to succeed Armond Vega of
Penn State are Gar O’Quinn of
Army. Ken Morgan from Navy,
and Penn State’s two sophomore
sensations. Leo Cunningham and
Jay Werner. Skyscraper U. does
not have anyone entered in this
special event.

The all-around event requires
that each contestant take part
in six different routines. These
are free exercises, long horse,
still rings, side horse, high bar,
and parallel bar.

Lowell Meier of Syracuse is the
defending champion in tumbling.
However, he has gone down to de-
feat twice this season. Penn State’s
Dave Dulaney and Graham Cowan
both registered higher scores than
Meier in the Lion-Orange dual
meet last month.

Service Schools Vie for Side Horse

Neeld was seventh in the East-
erns in tumbling last year. Other
outstanding entrants in this event
are Mel Merrill of Army and Walt
Dodge of Syracuse. Also, Adie
Stevens of the host school is rated
near the top.

It appears as if the side horse
will be a battle among contest-
ants from the two service
schools. O’Quinn of Army is the
defending champ and his clos-
est competition sltoul-d come
from teammate Jim Hill.

The group of Middle horsemen
include Morgan, Skip Sheppard,
Lou McFarland, and Tom Kim-
mel. The side horse has been the
Blue and Gold’s weakest event of
the season and thus the Panthers
ﬁgure to be shut out once again.

High Bar Competition Tops

The high bar will probably turn

out to be the closest event on the
two day program. Mulvihill and
Darling stand a fairly good chance
of ﬁnishing one-two. Both boys
have been scoring inthe 260's and
doing it constantly lately.

Ken Cooper of Navy, Joe Bay
from Temple, and Syracuse’s
Dodge all ﬁnished in the top ten
at the Eastern in ‘the high bar
last season. Bob Degen of Army
must be given a chance since
he downed Mulvihill apvd Dar-
ling in the Panther-Army en-
counter.

Degen and Phil Mullen of Penn’

State ﬁnished in a tie "for second
place in the ECAC tourney last

highly rated.

Nittany Lion’s Bob Foht. They
ﬁnished second and third in last
year’s Easternfinals. Don Shima
and Mulvihill are the main Pan-
ther threats.

Nevertheless O’Quinn, who
serves as the Army captain, and
Dodge could very well upset
McNutt and Foht on the paral-
lel bars. Both -have hit,270
scores on their specialty this
season and each could duplicate
that ﬁgure with a flawless per-
formance.

The Panthers were able to
sweep the ﬂying rings in last sea-
son’s ECAC competition, but one

of the performers, Dave Hirst, will
not participate because of an‘ el-
bow injury that has kept him out
of action all season long. However,
Darling and Hammond along with
Tom Trcese represent Skyscraper
U. on Friday.

Darling’s closest competition
will be furnished by Werner and
Bill Giallourakis of Army. Dar-
ling has defeated both men in dual
meet action this campaign.

“O’Quinn in parallel bars and
side horse, Dulaney and Meier in
tumbling, Mullen on the rope, and
Darling on rings are my selec-

tions,” stated Neiger,
