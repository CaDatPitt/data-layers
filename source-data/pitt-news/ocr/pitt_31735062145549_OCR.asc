Investigators Condemn Druids;
Suggest Charter Withdrawal
From John Marshall Group

 

Committee Scores
National Regime
On Druid Affairs

Election Methods And
Programs Wilt Under
Student Spotlight

Scoring the local and national activ-
ities of Druids, men's national honor-
ary activities fraternity, a.nd suggest-
ing to student relations committee
that the charter of John Marshall
club, honorary pre-legal fraternity, be
rescinded, the investigations commit-
tee of student relations committee
scored decisively in the ﬁrst exercise
of its power. With this announce-
ment to the Pitt News late yesterday
afternoon, the investigations group
prepares to appear before student re-
lations committee and uphold its
stand on both issues.

condemning the
ganization of Druids,
tee revealed that:

1. Drdids were asked to take
steps toward investigation of the
national office and strengthen the
national organization by election
of capable and permanent offic-
ials. Several chapters have al-
ready been dropped, it was re-
vealed yesterday, from the nation-
al organization.

2. No return has been made to
the local group by the national of-
ﬁces in return for the amount of
dues that are annually paid into
the nationa-I offices.

3. There are no national
headquarters. and no permanent
secretary. The central organiza-
tion of the national group is un-
stable.

Following the investigation of
the local chapter of the fraternity,
the investigation group discover-
ed that:

1. The group shows no record
sequences. Officers who are in-
ducted into their positions each
year do not have previous rec-
ords.

2. The group admitted the in-
fluence of outside special interest
groups in the election to Druids.
Immediate change in this respect
is necessary, the investigators be-
Iieve.

3. The Druid program appears
not to have the cooperation of the
entire Druid group. The inves-
tigators suggested that the pro-
gram be made practical instead of
theoretical.

 

 

national or-
the com-

4. The above evidence leads
the investigating committee to
believe that Druids are losing

their honorary aspect on the

campus.

Relating to the Druid evidence, the
committee believes that the ideal be-
hind Druids is substantially sound
and worthy of recognition on
the University of Pittsburgh
campus, the group offically stated
yesterday afternoon. However, the
individual members of Druids should
realize, the group -said, their obliga-
tion to the University and to its stu-
dent body in upholding the respect
and esteem of their honorary ideal.

Following a. two-meeting investiga-
tion of John Marshall club activities,
the investigators present the following
statement to student relations com-
mittee:

“The Investigations committee rec-
ommends to Student relations commit-
tee that the John Marshall clu'b be
deprived of its title “honorary" and -be
not permitted to tap members at the
honorary tapping assembly.”

The reasons for the suggestion that
the John Marshall club charter be
rescinded are:

1. The alleged honor requirements
are not in harmony with other campus
honorary fraternities,

2. Definite proof is revealed that
any and all applicants for member-
ship to John Marshall club have at
times in the past been accepted.

3. The admission for membership
have not been made on a basis of in-
terest in pre-legal subjects and activi-
ties or on honor grades in such sub-
jects.

4. The program of this organiza-
tion is such at the present time that
it can be carried on by a mere “Club”
organization.

5. By admission, John Marshall
club has failed in its objectives, it has
not been given the cooperation of its
members, and its only ground for ex-
istence is “Discussion” on legal sub-
jects.

Members of the investigating com-
mittee are Ray McCune E34, chair-
man; John B. 'Holbrook, E34; James
Danahey, C34; and John P, Bracken,
C34.

Druids appeared before the inves-
tigations group voluntarily after
being asked to do so. The committee
had no jurisdiction over the honor-
ary fraternity since it has been char-
tered on the campus under the fr-
ternity committee of the University.

spective class. The directors of
all upper classes will select four to
six captains to organize teams large
enough to cover their
classes.

At least one worker will approach
each student with a pledge card with
complete announcement of details for
the drive, according to VVadsworth’s
plans, so that each student will be
contacted.

LAPICA

spoke brieﬂy before the Inquiry

Asked if the police knew about the:

latter three, he answered, “Of course,"
but he did not explain the extent of
knowledge among the “higher ups.”
Criticizing the voters of Pittsburgh,
the councilman said: “In some dis-
tricts the vote is but ﬁfty or sixty
per cent of the total; in others it
averages 110 per cent or more of the
total; and in both cases the foreign
element far outvotes the native.”
Answering the question whether or
not the assessments were the same
for party and independent voters in
Pittsburgh, Garland gave his typical
answer and then added: "Seven out
of the present eleven city tax as-

sessors are from the same party.”

The councilman stated that Pitts-
burgh’s future taxation policy will
depend upon the man in power but
would not say just who the man in
power is at present.

After an interesting ﬁfteen minutes
in which the students asked questions
galore with which to trip up the coun-
cilman, one ﬁnally asked: “What will
happen if ﬁve Democrats are elected?”

Councilman Garland hesitated a
moment, wiped his brow, and then
blurted out: “God forbid the election
of ﬁve Democrats to the Pittsburgh
council!” _

William N, McNair, Democratic
candidate for may r, will address the
Municipal confere e at 12:30 o'clock
in Room 315, ’ lumni hall, today.
Although Mr. McNair has chosen as
his topic “Economic Law in Munici-

students along the lines that their
questions will dir ct.

1 The Honorable John S. Herron,
Mayor, spoke y sterday to a room
packed to the doérs with interested
listeners as a prin ipal feature of the
, Municipal confere _ ce.
' Mayor Herron ;was surprised at
E Councilman Carla ’s statement Wed-
fnesday, that Pitts _ rgh ranked among
the ﬁrst of ‘the ci. es in racketeering
activities. Mr. rron assured the
audience that
tainly not in that position, and that
the police syste was effectively
working toward ‘an elimination of
racketeering and I1 its implications.

There was a. li ly student discus-
sion on the exten .of police and city
administration o er's control over
commercialized v e. The students
held that the pol e system was in-
efficient and allovsted flagrant condi-
tions to exist. Mr. Herron replied
that the city was under control, vice
at a minimum, but any student who

welcome to come to his office and the
situation would be" eliminated.

In reply to the question is “Is
Coyne the real boss of the Republi-
can organization of the state?” Mr.
Herron replied that the answer was
dependent on one’s deﬁnition of
“boss.” He answered that Mr, Coyne
is the most important factor in the
Republican organization of western
Pennsylvania.

Chest d’rive*will i"5ceive 100 per cent
lsupport by member fraternities of In-

resolutions passed by the group at a
meeting Tuesday night at the Omega
Delta house.

At the same meetingg, King Dcrr,_
D34, who was recently appointed by,
President Edward McBride, C34, to:
head a committee to draw up a pro-,
gram of Council objectives, submittc-dl
a six point outline designed to en—i
large the scope and effectiveness of§
the organization. The program wasl
adopted by unanimous vote.

W, VV. Mendenhall, director of the

the newly organized Student
Chest campaign. At the conclusion
of his talk, a resolution was passed’
pledging co-operation in the drive
by the 15 fraternities in Council. The
representatives from the individual
fraternities went on record as approv-
ing of the purpose of the campaign
and promising complete support by
their fraternities.

Fraternities ha.ve also undertaken
the duty of seeing that each frater-
nity man at the University addresses
and mails to voters in the state the
ten postal cards each student re-
ceives today urging a yes vote for
Amendment 8.

The first two points of the program
submitted by Derr’s committee are
designed to develop a more under-
standing and friendly spirit between
campus fraternities, Point one calls
for a plan to adopt bi-weekly inter-
fraternity visitations. Under it, each
fraternity will send representatives
every other week to another house
for dinner. Point two concerns the
revival of an annual pledge dinner
with the new members of each house
as guests. It is possible that the din-
ner will be included among the events
of lnterfraternity Conference week
this month.

Point three states: “Fraternity
forums should be conducted approxi-
mately once each month, at which

speakers procured by Council will
lead discussions at the individual
houses.”

The fourth point advocates the un-
dertaking of a vigorous campaign to
attract out of town high school grad-
uates to enroll at the University.

Point ﬁve suggests the -sponsoring
of a pre-rushing program to acquaint
freshmen with the fraternity system.
A smoker has been suggested as a
means of carrying out this project.

The last point suggests that a mem-
ber of the Pitt News staff be invited
to attend the meetings of Council to
report the activities and clarify the
position of Council to the student
body.

The program was returned to the
committee after its adoption for the

 

purpose of working out details in
making it practical.

Jurisdiction of student relations,

Smith Asks For Fair View
Toward Practical Politics

 

Points To Increase Value Of Student Citizenship Stated
At Municipal Conference Dinner

Judge Ralph Smith of the Court of
Common Pleas closed the ﬁrst day of
the Student Conference on Municipal
Issues “at the conference dinner with
the suggestion of a more common
Sense of view of practical politics.

Judge Smith pointed out the heces-
sity of political parties in the carry-
ing on of our government and that
any corrupt or inefficient government
is directly attriubutable to the non-
voters. The weakness of independent
parties when opposed by well organ-
ized parties and also the lax interest
of the voter were given by the Judge
as factors opposing the success of
sporadic reform movements.

“As long as the good, honest citizen
keeps his supercilious attitude toward
city politics, he should have no com-
plaint.

“I do not believe the cure for better

government lies in a change of the
form. It lies rather in the men whom
the voters and non-voters put into of-
ﬁce.

“If you have any desire to become
a factor in better government, here
is some advice: (1), learn structure
and mechanism of government, both
local and national; (2), understand
the underlying philosophy of govern-
ment; (3), learn something about
Dractical politics; and (4), be active
in politics.’’

Judge Smith gave the students
some points to question the two ma-
joralty candidates, William N, McNair
and John S. Herron, who will speak
this week. The points are, taxation,
extent of civil service, policy toward
commercial racketeering and to what
extent the city will interfere with pri-
vate life of the citizens.”

Hallock will outline the purpose of
Amendment 8, which calls for a bond

That Game Tomorrow

OLLOWING THE OVERFLOVV of enthusiasm
Foyer Notre Dame’s defeat at the hands of the
Pitt gridders last Saturday at South Bend, Pitt
students are under the impression that tomorrow’s
game with Centre college is just a “breather,” an-
) - other game to give

 ’ I the substitutes
something to do.
Impressive as Pitt
might have look-
ed at South Bend
last Saturday, the
s t o r y tomorrow
will be a long, sad
one if the team
feels that CcI1.t1“e
is going to be a
pushover. Centre
comes here tomor-
row after holding
Xavier, the crew
which held Car-
negie Tech ’s team
(which also beat
 - - --- Notre Dame) to a

‘J36 l§..SlU_Z'hf_£_'/9/-‘fl/V0 3 to 0 score.

V‘_Ve can trust Coach Sutherland and his board
of strategy not to allow the boys to get over-
confident. A defeat at the hands of Centre, not

at all impossible, would take away from Pitt what

measure of national standing it has attained since -
beating Notre Dame last week. Centre probably V

has been drilling into its players the fact that the
Pitt lads are “cocky,” that a victory over Notre
Plame was all they wanted, and that beating Pitt
would be a glorious feat for a little school like
Centre.

‘ Pitt students who are expecting a complete
rout of the Centre football team tomorrow will get
a surprise, especially if the Pitt boys make up their
minds that Centre is coming up to ﬁght and would
likenothing better than a victory over Pitt. Win-
ning over Notre Dame is good enough, and win-
ning over Centre is good enough, but an over-con-
ﬁdent student body is worse than an over-conﬁdent

. team !

Amendment 8 MUST Pass!
ODAY’S ASSEMBLY IN MEMORIAL HALL, at

which J. W. Hallock, secretary of the General
Alumni association, will speak, brings the importance

of the passage of Amendment 8 directly before the stu-
dent body of the University. It is vital that every stu-
-dent in the University attend today's assembly in View
of the fact that me welfare of millions of people in

Pennsylvania depends entirely on the passage or failure
of the measure.

In addition to its pertinent application to the Univer-
slty, Amendment 8 vitally concerns welfare agencies,
hospitals and state aided colleges and universities. Most
of the hospitals in the Pittsburgh area are desperately
in need of state funds and many of them are almost
ready to close their doors. Welfare agencies, which
have supported thousands of unemployed in the state
during the last two or three years, are faced with pos-
sible lack of funds. State-aided colleges and univer-
sities will have to shorten curricula, decrease the num-
ber of extra-curricular activities and make reduction in
teaching and administrative staffs unless the Amend-
ment is passed.

‘ Today's assembly will clearly present the facts on
both sides of the argument over Amendment 8. It should
be of vital interest to students of the University to attend
today's assembly and understand the signiﬁcance of the
proposed addition to the state constitution.

Student Chest Drive

HE STUDENT CHEST DRIVE, which opens on the
campus on Monday, November 13, in combining
the various campus funds and tag days, presents a dif-
ferent and appealing front to the students of the Univer-
sity. First, it appears to be strictly a student drive
among students for funds to be used in welfare of stu-
‘dents. Second, by combining the tag days and cam-
paigns, it does away with the strain on the services of
workers and the purses of subscribers that subsequent

campaigns and tag days might have.

,' Approximately 150 students will take part in the
campus solicitation, the Pitt News was told, and the
fact that such a great number of students are interested
in the campaign. augurs well for the success of the drive.
Lining up fraternities, campus organizations and stu-
dents individually, the leaders of the campaign are cover-
ing the ground well and are building an excellent founda-
tion for the main part of the drive, whi'ch is to come
later. ' ’

, The Pitt News heartily pledges its cooperation with
the leaders of the campaign and urges all students of
the University to devote their time and funds for the
success of the drive.

Effluvia

“A Subtle Emanation”
By Saul Weisberg

Editor's Note:—The opinions expressed in this col-
umn are the personal views of the writer and are
not to be taken to be in conformance with the edi-
torial policy of the Pitt News.

ATHER FREQUENTLY, OF LATE, I have noticed

the opinions voiced that the American student is
becoming politically aroused, The depression and its
consequent hardships are supposed to have so affected
the college boy and girl that economic problems have
assumed importance to them.

There was a time not long ago when such an awaken-
ing seemed eminently desirable. At the time, I was im-
pressed by the thought of all the accomplishments that
the students, when organized, could achieve. Lately,
however, I have been veering to the conclusion that per-
haps the student may just as well remain apathetic.
For I have realized that students’ activities could just
as easily be bad as good_ I have noticed, for instance,
that the German collegiate group seems to be heart and
soul for Hitlerism, with all its implications. And I can
see no good reason to prevent the American student
from doing the same thing.

FTER ALL, THE GERMAN STUDENTS are drawn
from the middle class of Germany, and, as a result,

it might have been expected that they would subscribe
to the doctrines of Fascism, which is propagandized as
a middle-class movement. The American students, in
the main, are also drawn from the middle" class. And
when, and if, they take a part in social affairs, they, too,

.might very logically support Fascism, or even worse, its

Hitlerized version.
It has also been stated that students might organize
for mass action against war. I am not so sure, however,
that such a mass action would result in an anti-war
campaign. Students, even today, are very generally of
a nationalistic pattern. What guarantee is there that
students will not attempt a policy of national self—ag-
grandizement, such a policy leading to war?

Furthermore, college education is not the remarkably
liberalizing influence that it is reputed to be. Last year,
the Daily Princetonian conducted a collegiate poll on the
presidential election_ The poll was reasonably thorough
and representative, and covered plenty of territory. But
the results were decisively in favor of Hoover with the
students voting almost exclusively according to time-
worn sectional prejudices. Roosevelt was supported by
the South, Hoover by the East and the Far West, and
Roosevelt and especially Thomas by the Mid-west. The
New York colleges, with what may be called their
proletarian student body, vigorously upheld Thomas and
Foster.

HE POLL DEMONSTRATED, with some clarity,

how amazingly removed from general opinion
throughout the entire country students are, It might
have been expected that persons attending colleges
would fall in line with the ideas held everywhere or
even that their ideas would be advanced. But it was
hardly anticipated that the students would prove to be
conservative. Of course, their conservatism was mainly
the conservatism of their parents and their forebears in
general.

As a matter of fact, I would still like to see the stu-
dents aroused. But let them be educated first. Let
them get a basis of information from which their atti-
tudes may flow. It will serve no just purpose to have
them follow movements or support ideas which will only
intensify the injustices and the mistakes from which We
suffer today. If they are to be active, let them have a
reason and a good reason for their activity. If they
possess such a reason, then, perhaps, they can make a
ftollectlve impression upon existing society, _a c011eCti-,-e
impression which will tend towards peace and tolerance,
not conﬂict and oppression.

Between

You, Me
And The

Lamp Post
  By Wilbur Clark

The Heinz Memorial chapel, being
erected on the campus by the heirs
of Henry J. Heinz. is to be exactly
57 feet wide, which has nothing to
do with the fact that I was going
to do a column on the International
Art exhibit, its implications and
complications, only I ﬁnd myself more

interested, for the moment at least,
in Esquire, the quarterly for men, but
recently shown on the news stands.
After all, I guess the pictures are

due to hang and be damned for some ‘

time yet and there is little possi-
bility of any one, even Florence Fish-
er Parry, saying about the exhibit
those things that I hope to express.

But this Esquire magazine. Here
we have something that is almost
a hundred per cent entertainment
from beginning to end. And it isn't
aimed at the Illumanati either. The
cover is more reminiscent of a trad-
er’s and trapper’s manual than iii-
dicitative of the quality of the period-
ical. But beneath the cover—well,
let's get on the inside,

The contents fall into seven class-
iﬁcations. Articles, contributed by
Ernest Hemingway, Nicholas Murray
Butler, Gilbert Seldes, Ring Lardner,
Jr., and Chas. Hanson Towne_ Fiction,
represented by stories of John Dos
Passos, William McFee, Manuel Kom-
roff, Morley Callaghan, Erskine Cald-
well, Dashiell Hammett, Douglas Fair-
banks, Jr., and Vincent Starrett.
Sports articles are written by Bobby
Jones, Gene Tunney, Benny Leonard
and Charley Paddock. Humor is sup-
plied by George Ade, Montague Glass,
Geo. S. Chappell, Harry Hershﬂeld,
Robert Buckner and David Munroe.
Poetry, represented by Joseph Aus-
lander and Audrey Wurdemann. The
most popular fea.ture, the cartoons,
are done by C. Alajalov, ‘William Steig,
E. Simms Campbell, John Groth,
George Petty, Nat Karson and Ty
Mahon. Photography is handled by
Gilbert Seehausen and Paul Trebil-
cock,

Considerable space is given to
fashion plates, which are interesting
even if they have no utility for we
paupers,

The second colored picture in the
magazine is a, water color_ of the
“Port of New York,” by John Dos
Passos, which if hung at the Inter-
national certainly would have taken
honorable mention,

Caldwel1’s “August Afternoon,” a.
short story, will be loudly acclaimed
by some and equally as loudly de-
nounced by other readers. The voice
here is raised in acclaim. It’s a ﬁne
piece of writing, different, and good.

The two poems, one “Exit at the
Morgue,” by Auslander, the other,
“The Lease of Lust,” by VVurdemann,
are especially entertaining. A few
lines of the latter has been haunting
me.

“Remember, be glad;
When you’re old and unloving
You’ll have what you’ve had.”

Though the entire magazine is suc-
cessful in all its details, it is the
exceptional art work that is butstand-
ing Those who have read the ﬁrst
issue will ﬁnd it difficult to wait for
the next.

“Give Me Liberty” Is
Cry Of Freshmen
As Rules End

No longer must the freshman
maiden skulk out the back door,
appear wary and peer nervously
as she sits on the benches in
Alumni hall. No longer must she
go about the campus a branded
woman, ﬂaunting her lowly state
to the multitudes.

Today marks independence day
for the women of the class of ’37.
In other words. freshman regula-
tions are over. From now on

the upperclassmen won't be able
to distinguish their inferiors,
unless, of course,._they are carry-
ing their colorful freshman theme
books. The battle cry is no longer
“Give Me Liberty or Give Me -——”

The end of regulations means
liberty to others besides the
freshmen. Those upperclassmen.
formerly regarded as hawkshaws,
demons and ogres, are now free
to smile once more. A prominent
woman, on the campus today, con-
fessed that she heard a freshman
say of her, “Doesn’t she ever
smile?” whereupon the above-
mentioned prominent woman re-
plied: “Wait, my dear, until you
too are made responsible for in-
itiating a mob of bright young
things.”

To Go On Radio At 11:30

At 10 o’clock tonight in the ball
room of the Schenley hotel, Paul
Specht’s orchestra will open the an-
nual Soph Hop with soft music to ac-
company the digniﬁed steps of the
grand march.

Anne Griffith, a senior in the School
of Education, will lead the march
with Arthur Stroyd, chairman of the
year's ﬁrst formal affair. Miss Grif-
fith is a member of Kappa Kappa
Gamma. .

The unusual programs prepared for
the dance will be distributed during
the march. Though they cannot be
called favors, the dance cards embody
a novel feature with future useful-
ness that should prove highly accept-
able to the feminine guests at the
Hop. A ﬁfteen minute interval will
take place immediately following dis-
tribution of the programs, allowing
time for them to be ﬁlled out.

The orchestra. tonight, famous for
its arrangements of classical music set
to dance tempo, comes to Pitt for the
third consecutive year with a solid
reputation. Specht has played three
Inaugural Balls in his career as a
maestro, has been featured on in-
numerable nation-wide radio hook-
ups, has invaded England successfully
on a number of occasions, and is now
resting on the laurels of a favorable
reception at the ‘Casino at. the Gen-
tury of Progress. He was booked in-
to the Panhellenic Ball last year, and
played for the Junior Prom two years
ago.

Stroyd announced late yesterday
that Specht’s music will be broadcast
from the dance tonight over WWSW
for the half hour from 11:30 to 12
o’clock.

The usual last minute splurge of
ticket buying has been taking place
since Wednesday, and the 22 mem-
bers of the committee have reported
a satisfactory return. The compara-
tively low price for the affair, $2.50
per couple, which marks the dance
as the most inexpensive Soph Hop on
record, has placed the Hop within the
means of a large percentage of so-
cially-minded students who considered
the average major dance assessments
too high.

A booth will be maintained under
the clock in Alumni hall until 5
o’clock this afternoon at which tickets
will be available. They may also be
purchased from members on the com-
mittee and in 801 Cathedral of Learn-
ing. The committee includes. Stroyd,

.g“Freshmen Will Be
Freshmen!”  

 

Oh, what a job! Finding 3-
brunette or a blonde with blue
eyes, or getting a tie for a cer- L
tain freshman boy, or matching
up pretty little freshman girls
with big bashful fellows, is no
easy task.

That’s what the Cwens had to
do at the freshman invitation
dance, given Tuesday evening.
An anxious boy without a. tie,
possessing a registration card and
a ticket, shyly asked one of the
Cwens what other requisites he
needed in order to get in, When :
she replied that there were no
others, he sobbingly begged her
to do her Cwen service by secur-
ing the tie. Promptly rushing to
Mrs. Foster, she found that that
good lady had a locked cupboard
ﬁlled with lots of “swanky” ties.

According to the name cards,
George Bernard Shaw, without
the accent or whiskers, was pres-
ent. A meek little Cwen ques-
tioned George concerning his ac-
cent and he claimed he had over-
come it with great difficulty.

The Cwens are seriously con-
sidering the idea of opening a
matching service bureau. Many
a Cwen wore o11t shoe leather
running after fellows to hitch up
to girls.

The last of the Cwen invita-
tion dances went off very suc-
cessfully, with sixty-nine couples

The Golden Panther gridders of
good old Pittsburgh should get some
sort of breather tomorrow afternoon
at the Stadium when they meet the
Praying Colonels from Centre college,
Danville, Kentucky.

It’s not that the Centre boys are
the poorest team in the country.
Among other things this year they
defeated Xavier of Cincinnati, the
same team which held Carnegie Tech
to a 3 to 0 score, by a 7 to 0 margin,
and held the strong Boston college
team, one of the strongest in the
East, to a 7 to 0 count.

Although Coach Sutherland would,
like to rest his regulars, reports from 3
Danville regarding the strength of
the Southern boys have alarmed him
somewhat, and he will probably start

most of his regulars. However, if it
is at all possible Jock will have some
of the second-stringers in there.
Ormiston, Shedlosky and Randour
should see quite a bit of action.

The Colonel to be watched tomor-
row is a gentleman by the name of
Hamilton. Hamilton, a quarterback,
is touted to be one of the best passers

in the South, The Centre team, which
will start the game here tomorrow,
will be composed of ﬁve seniors, three
juniors and three sophomores. Its
line will average 190 pounds a.nd its
backﬁeld, 170.

The southern team is coached by
Ed Kubale, who played center for the
Colonels for four years, beginning in
1921. He played on the 1924 Centre
team, the best in its history, That
was the year the Colonels defeated
Kentucky, Georgia, Alabama and Ten-
nessee on successive Saturdays,

Coach Sutherland is practically
certain to use Shedlosky and
Randour at the halfbacks. If he
goes through with his tentative plans
of early in the week, he will probably
start Timmons and Sites at the ends,
Hoel and Olejnicsak or Detzel at the
tackles, Kutz and Ormiston at the
guards, Shotwell at center, Munjas
at quarterbck and Weisenbaugh at
fullback.

Fifteen ‘thousand Western Penn-

sylvania Boy Scouts will attend to—,

morrow’s game as guests of the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh. They will oc-
cupy sections 20, 21 and 22 in the
Stadium.

The game starts at 2:00.

Clash With Kiski

Gougler To Use Same Lineup As
Last Friday's

Coach “Skip” Gougler’s freshman
eleven will meet a strong Kiski grid
team this afternoon at 2:30 o'clock
at Saltsburg. Kiski, smarting from
a defeat administered by the Carnegie
Tech Plebes, is certain to give the
little Panthers plenty of competition.

Coach Gougler, satisﬁed with the
lineup that defeated West Virginia
last Friday, intends to use the same
combination against Kiski. This calls
for Dorsey and Muzyk at the end
positions, Abrizienis and Dumils at
the tackles, Hanley and Scarfpin ﬁll-
ing the guard posts, and Treece at
center. In the backﬁeld Ifolla and
O’Nei1 will do the halfbacking, Steele
will be at the fullback position and
Quarantello will call signals.

Izzo, substituting at quarterback
for Quarantello, was the only Pitt man
to suifer an injury in last week’s
game. Late in the game, while mak-
ing an end run, he suffered a sprained
ankle.

Pitt, again captured ﬁrst place for
the fresh. Prosenik, of Pitt, ﬁnished
in third place while his teammates,
Radosevich and Beachler, followed

Meet W. Virginia

Varsity And Freshman Teams
Engage Mountaineers

By Charles Ruch

Both the varsity and freshman
cross-country teams will journey
abroad to Morgantown tomorrow to
meet the Mountaineers and the Little
Mountaineers of West Virginia uni-
versity in dual meets.

The varsity will be anxious to break
into the win column after last Satur-
day’s tough loss at Notre Dame, The
fresh will endeavor to hang up their
fourth straight victory, Just how
diﬂicult it may be for the boys to ful-
ﬁll these hopes is best stated by
Coach Olson. “Over in Schenley
Park we have the toughest course in
Pennsylvania. But that doesn’t say a
thing about the one they have down
at M.organtown. I’m rather dubious
about » the outcome of Saturday’s
tilts.”

The varsity boys making the trip
are Albright, Lawrence, Wagen-
hauser, Kirkpatrick, Musico, Cook,
Watkins, Loncher, Christman, Kopp,
and trip—manager Baker. James Potts,
assistant track coach, will have charge
of the freshman harriers and will take
with him Tost, Prosenik, Leggin, Rad-
osevich, Beachler, Pfaff, Montroll and
Shields. “"

The Dukes

Anyone who has the idea that the Duquesne game, scheduled for Armis-

tice day, is going to be a “snap” may be mistaken.

At the beginning of the

season, this column was among the ﬁrst to brand the game as a set-up.
Since that time, the Dukes have run through seven good teams, and will

ilikely enter the Pitt game undefeatediand untied.

It so happens that the neighborhood in which I live is infested
with Duquesne students, Duquesne boosters, and those who don't

know enough to move out.

Every Duke victory brings the wolf pack

closer to the scout’s domicile (house), and the cries at the present

time resemble the Highland Park zoo at meal time.

In fact the illu-

sion of a zoo is quite apt when one pieces the howlers together.
However, there is always one thing that I can fall back on to rid
myself of the pestilence, namely, offering to bet several wads of

cabbage on the outcome of the game.

This invariably reduces the

roar of the mob to a mere whisper.

The scheme of things last year ran in three distinct cycles.

When Centre college comes to town tomorrow, many an old fan, in the
student section, will think of B0 McMillen and the boys who used to upset
the best teams in the country. Personally, I always associate Centre col-

lege with Bo McMillen.

It so happens that I had the pleasure of hearing

“Bo” recite a quaint bit of poetry that had to do with a football player
who thought a freight train had hit him. My impression at the time was
that the football player in the poem was slightly balmy, and leaning to-

Centre football coaches in the past few years have done their
best to change the “Praying Colonels” into the “Preying Colonels.”
The result has been somewhat satisfactory, but the southern boys
can hardly be ranked in the same class with the Panthers at the pres-

ent time.

Remembering what Centre teams have done in the past,

and taking into account that Dr. Sutherland may start the reserves,

don't be too radical in quarterbacking the game today.

Begin Practice

Prepare For Opening Battle With
I-Ioyas, December 9

Although the football season is
just now reaching its peak, prepara-
tions for the coming basketball sea-
son are already under way. The Pitt
varsity cagers will turn out again on
Monday night to begin strenuous work
for the opening game of the Eastern
Intercollegiate conference in which

the Panthers will play host to the
Georgetown Hoyas on December 9.
This game will end a day crammed
with basketball activity for the sev-
eral hundred high school and colle-
giate coaches of the district who are
expected to attend Dr. H. C. Carl-
son’s annual cage clinic, The high
school mentors will have their session
in the forenoon while the collegiate
coaches will meet after lunch. The
Pitt team will be used in displays of
offensives and in demonstrations of
the new rules for the coming season.
Prospects for the Pitt ﬂoor season
are exceptionally bright. The team
that captured 19 out of 24 games last
season will return, man for man, with
two exceptions. One is Don Smith,
captain and star of last year’s aggre-
gation, and the other is Rocco Cutri,
dependable relief man. Don M,c—
Camant, Russ Ochsenhirt, and Char-
ley Hughes are again very much
available and will lead the team as co-
captains, Claire Cribbs and Skip
Hughes, both of whom saw consider-
able service last year, will also be on

and the Great brothers, Pete Noon,
Ted Roderick and Lefty Wadsworth,
of last year’s fresh team. It’s rather
early to be getting much of a line on
the actual strength of the new com-
bination, but the “Winemall” signs
are still very promiscuous in the var-
sity dressing room.

'Scotch Campaign Teams
Give Reports At Meeting

At the meeting of the Scottish com-

report was given on the 12 campaign
teams pledged to raise $3,600 for the
Scotch room. The teams are work-

B. Sutherland, chairman of the group.
Each team captain is an elected rep-
resentative from each lodge of the

Daughters of Scotia and the clans.
A detailed report on the recent mas-
querade dance at the Schenley hotel
was also given.

The committee for the Irish room
in the Cathedral met last Thursday
evening, October 26. This committee
is the ﬁfteenth to be organized among
the 17 nationality groups, which will
