Dannies Directs
Plan for Senior

Class Memorial

Graduates Will Leave
Flag Pole to University

The “stars and stripes” and the
‘University colors will wave from a
towering ﬂagpole high above the
Cathedral campus as a welcome‘ to
returning University undergraduates
next September. —

That is the aim of the Senior
Memorial Committee, which this
week ‘announced the memorial gift
of the University class of 1939.

Robert Dannies, BA, chairman of
thesenior Memorial Committee, ex-
pressed the sentiment of the group
this week as “the goal for this‘ year
is to raise enough money to erect a
ﬂag pole between the Cathedral and
Heinz Chapel.

Said Dannies, “There is at present
no ﬂag pole on campus. This will be
a distinctive and permanent gift.”

Present plans provide for the erec-
tion of the memorial flag ‘pole this
summer. According V to Dannies,

every senior will be personally so— V

licited next week. A surplus of
several hundred dollars in the sen-
ior treasury will reduce the expense
to each graduate to only one dollar.

, All seniors are requested by Dan-
nies t_o contribute one dollar either
through the office of the dean of men
or at the Cap and Gown return in
the Stadium on Commencement day.

Students Act
To Restore

Cut in Grant
SFA Leads: Drive

In Senate Protest P

Signing of petitions and send-

ing of postcards protesting any ‘

cut. in the University appropria-
tion marked the spontaneous stu-
dent action resulting from a pro-
posed slash of $88,000 from the
state grant to the University.

Student. Faculty Association, un-
der. Pat Cus.ick, E40, president, led
the protest by distributing petitions
in second hour classes Wednesday
and sponsoring the ground floor
booth where cards to state senators
could be ﬁlled out and mailed.

Actionpin state house of represen-
tatives boosted the committee on ap-
propriations’ estimate to $1,880,000
for the next two years as the state’s
share in University expenses. The
cut was restored upon the recom-
mendation of Republican ﬂoor leader
Robert Woodside. 1

Several unsuccessful amendments
were proposed tothe bill. Represen-
tatives Holland and Dick asked for
$1,250,000 for the University proper,
and $250,000 additional for the Med-
ical School.

Representative Al Tronzo was the
author of an amendment, also unsuc-
cessful, to change the composition of
the board of trustees of the Univer-
sity. Another clause of the amend-
ment stated that no ofﬁcial of the

’University might receive a larger

salary than the Governor of Penn-
sylvania. This rider would have the
effect of slashing the Chancellor's sal-
ary.

Regardless of the action of the House
in the appropriations matter, it was
planned to send the petitions and
postcards to Harrisburg to forestall
any attempt to slash the grant in the"
Senate» or by executive action.

 

Players   Give
‘Our Town’

“Our Town” will make its third
and ﬁnal appearance as a Pitt Players
presentation this evening at 8:15
o’clock in Stephen Foster Memorial,
according to Buell Whitehill, Players
director.

Thornton Wilder’s Pulitzer prize
winner for 1938, after being acclaim-
ed in its professional appearances,
was so well liked in the first show-
ing on campus during Spring Festival
week that the Players have arranged
for a “repeat” performance.

Tickets may be purchased today
at the ground ﬂoor booth, or at the
Foster Memorial this evening, for 50
cents, Harrison Chandler, BA39, bus-
iness manager, has stated.

Cosgrove Wins Speech Contest   
I With Clever Poetry Discussion

A
V

O By Fred S. Robie

An unusual interpretation of poe-
try described in well-chosen words
placed John Cosgrove, Ed40. at the
head of the six ﬁnalists in" the ﬁf-
teenth annual University speech con-
test last Wednesday at Foster Memo-
rial.

Opposing the present high school
system of beginning poetry study
with Beowulf and ending with Carl
Sandburg, Cosgrove proposed to re-
verse the process and “start the high
school lad with a poetry which is
real to him.”

In a diatribe against the offer of
University scholarships to German
refugees, Frank Miller, C41, de-
nounced Pitt News’ editorials as in-
consistent and unfounded to win sec-
ond place with a speech not valid
itself in evidence.

Abe Wolovitz.C’C,40, placed third
with an explanation of the interna-
tional crisis. He advanced an alli-
ance with Great Britain as the best
solution for our own national inter-
ests.

Picturing the lack of school spirit
in the University, Robert Shaw, C41,
oresented an idea for a possible

semblywto “tie faculty, students,
schoohbuildings together.”

Practical application of the prin-
ciples of progressive education and
not the principles themselves were
declared confusing and disturbing to
the nervous systems of both students
and teachersby Roberta Webb, Ed40,
in her presentation.

Declaring peace as a problem for

the people of a nation and not a
problem of government, Richard
Klemer, C39, made an appeal. for
personal pledges to sustain peace.
Judges were John C. Amundson,
instructor in history, Frederick P.
Mayer, associate professor of Eng-
lish, and Dr. Benjamin Williams, pro-
fessor of political science.

“Intellectual and academic free-

STRAYED . . A

The Quality of Mercy is not strain-
ed. Of course the removal of my
purse from the catalog room was ac-
cidental. And the return of the some

black purse to the Mai-shal’s office
was quite casual. I don't begrudge
you 75 cents, not even the new pack
of cigarettes, if they were your
brand—nll the better. But I do be-
g’:-iulge you the silver dollar, not be-
cause of its intrinsic value but its
sentimental attraction. If it pleases
God and you, return the same silver

The protest against the proposed

this protest gave unmistakable evi-

We must realize that there are
probably better ways of putting such
an endeavor across, but I do feelthat
we hayei taken the most effective’
measures possible under stress of

Gerald Ziskind, C41:

Like all the rest of the pressure
groups Pitt reacts ‘to an appropria-
tion cut. At least the students know
their interests ;now. My regret is
that last November Pitt students con-
tributed to this calamity.

No matter what you
plan to do this summer,
I chances are you’ll have
a busy time. So keep

the telephone in mind

 

. . . for work or play.

In hunting a job or licking the job, it’s a
good idea to let the tele-
phone help. The man
or woman who tele-
phones gets there first-

and gets more done in

less time with less effort.
