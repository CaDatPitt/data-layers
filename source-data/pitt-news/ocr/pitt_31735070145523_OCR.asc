in a battle of the Big East’s leading of-
fense and defense yesterday at the Pe-

“ tersen Events Center, defense won.

No. 3Vllanova came into the game
averaging a league-best 85 points a
contest, but matched its season-low
by scoring just 65 in defeat to No. 19
Pitt. The Panthers allow a league—low
61.2 points per game. ,

The Wildcats (22—4, 11-3 Big East)
lead the league in scoring thanks to
their slashingoffense and quick guard
play, which the Panthers limited.

“We were able to contain their
penetration,” Pitt Coachjamie Dixon
said.

Part ofhow the Panthers (21-6, 10-
4) accomplished this was throwing
constantly changing defensive looks
at Villanova.

 “They have guys like .[Nasir] Rob-
inson, [Gilbert] Brown, [Brad] Wana-
maker that can all guard one through
three,” Villanova guard Scottie Reyn-
olds said. ,

With guards like Reynolds, Corey
Fisher, Reggie'Redding and Corey
Stokes, Villanova also likes to play up
tempo and run the court, something
the Panthers didn’t allow the Wildcats
to do. '

“Theywere goingdeeper into their
shot clock than we were, because we
were ableto control them defensively,”
Dixon said. .
‘ But cutting down on Villanova’
penetration to the hoop wasn’t the
only way Pitt controlled the pace of
the game.

“They ran the clock, and if they
missed theywere able to get offensive
rebounds and do it all over again,” Vil-
lanova Coach Jay Wright said.""I‘hey
control the tempo.”

The Panthers out-rebounded Vil-

lanova 40-34, including 21-12 on the _

offensive glass. Gary McGhee pulled

down a game-high 10 rebounds, eight
offensive. Including McGhee, the Pan-

thers had eight players with at least ‘

two rebounds each. .

Eight Panthers also scored at least
two points. .

“The balance of this team excites
me,” Dixon said. “We ran sets for
four or ﬁve different guys down the
stretch.” * V

The Panthers were led by Ashton
Gibbs’ 21 points. He has now scored at
least20 inthree of the last four games
afterbeing held to less than 20 the four
games prior to those. 1

“We knew we couldn’t over-com-
mit to Gibbs,” Wright said. “He waits
for his shot. That’s why he hits them.
He doesn’t take many bad shots. He

knows that he is always aweapon.”
Gilbert Brown was second on the
team in scoring, netting 16 off the

' bench. Jermaine Dixon added in 10,_ l

but shot just 3-for-15 on the after-
noon.
“They were running a triangle-

and—twobnAshton and Brad, solwas ~

getting a lot of looks,” he said. “I just
wasn’t knocking them down.”

While he didn’t shoot particularly ,

well, Dixon helped the victoryin other
ways. Hefﬁnished with six rebounds,
three assists, three blocks and three
steals. '

“It’s his team,” Jamie Dixon said.
“He’s the leader. When he wants to
leave the pregame meal, we go. I'fol-
low him.”

Jermaine Dixon also had the task - ll

of being the primary defender on

’ Reynolds. The senior guard ﬁnished‘

the game with 20 points, 17 in the

“second half.

The win gives Pitt its third victory
against a top-ﬁve team this season.

The Panthers beatthen-No. 5 Syracuse *

82-72 onjan. 2', and then-No. 4 West
Virginia 98—95'in triple overtime Feb.
12. Pitt is 7-0 all—time against teams

ranked in the top ﬁve at the Petersen

Events Center. .
The Panthers are also 4-0 all-time

' whenwearingtheiralternate gold jer-

seys, which they were sporting yes-

terday infront of the 12,920 people
in attendance. It was the largest on-
campus crowd for a basketball game
inschool history. "

“The Pete just brings a different
type of atmosphere to the game,”
Brown said. ' * '

Why Susie Meistermatterse

Oliver Bateman
, For the Pitt News

The Moustache Column ofAmerica
is proud to present 

Local Legends with Susie Meis-
ter ‘

Pittsburgh — the little city that
almostdid and still might — has
served as the launching pad for the
careers of former Extreme Cham-
pionship Wrestling World~Heavy-
weight Champion Shane Douglas,
comic book publisherjim Shooter,
retired federal judge Robert'Bork,

and the jam band Rusted Root. Su-l

sie Meister, a Pittsburgh native and
multiple—time winner of assorted
duels and challenges held on the
MTV cable television network, con-
tinues this tradition of excellence.

Because Meister has achieved
such a high level of fame, the Mous-
tache Club of America arranged a
meeting with her at a local watering
hole. In these turbulent economic
times, we believe that young people
could learn much from her example.
As always, we held nothing back. We
asked her the toughest questions
imaginable, and the result was an
interview for the ages. .

Q: So you got your ﬁrst taste

   

of fame on Road Rules, a TV show
where people competed for fabulous

. prizes while driving to different 10-

cations. What was that like? Do you
ever wish that you got your ﬁrst taste
of fame on a different show, such as
the big singing contest or that one
with the sassy, tan fat girl?

A: No, but .I would watch the
people from my show take on the
fat girl and her friends. We would
probably win, since they’re not as in-
terested in strategy. They are tough,
though. That fat girl can really take
a punch.

Q: Now that there aren’t as many
jobs due to global warn1ing and what
have you, do you think that fame is

a good option for people who don’t ‘

want to work so hard?

A: Sure, but it’s harder to get
fame in 2010 than it was in 2000. I
got my fame when you didn’t have
to lower your standards. These days,
as a girl, you’ve got to be willing to
show something. It’s not something
I did or would do, but I say go for it
if fame is what you want.

Q: You’ve changed yourhair color
from blonde to dirty blonde or bru-
nette or something. The change was
so dramatic that we didn’t recognize
you. Do you think the fans will?

, A: Well, you’re not normal. I’m

pretty sure viewers will know that
I’m the same person. You stay the
same person even if you change your
hair color. I’m sorry I tricked you.

Q: How do you handle your
fame? We don’t have any of that,
but maybe some of our readers do.
We’re sure they’d like to hear your
thoughts -about it.

A: Whenever people recognize
me, they ask me the same questions.

. “Was it ﬁm?” “Was it hard?” “Are

you guys still friends?” It’s weird
that these are the only things they
want to know. I wish they wouldask
more substantial questions, like
“How did it feel to do that challenge
while wearing a microphone?” But
they don’t and they never will. The
answers to the questions they do
ask are sometimes, it depends, and
some of us are. Write those down.

Q: As far as our top celebrities
go, who is your biggest inspiration?
Who should the youthful up—and—
comers look to as a pacesetter?

A: I’ve appeared on the Soup, so

‘ I don’t have to answer this question.

It does seem that the new “We are
the World” Video is a real who’s who
of the big names, though.

Q: Do you have a favorite product
that you’d like to lend your fame to

vau.:_ at WailacelP'r1 . _  

Fame, dolphin tats, d rles of the road

by way of an endorsement deal?
A: I’m a fan of Old Spice. They

had an uphill battle with that name,

and they’ve done a great job with

_ it. I might be persuaded to endorse

Farmville, if I could ﬁgure out why
anyone would want to play a game
like that. Is this what you want to
hear? V ’ .

Q: How do you stay in peak con-
dition for your physical challenges?
Do you do CrossFit like those studs
in “3oo”?

A: I don’t work out at all, but in
spite of that I’ve never been voted
off. You have people on the show
who are 250 pounds and ripped

' or whatever, and that doesn’t help

them do most of these things. V

Q:‘How do you feel about not
having a Wikipedia entry?

A: I don’t know what I’d put on
there if I did. I have three tattoos, but
other than that I haven’t really done
anything exciting or scandalous
with my life. I don’t have a tattoo of
dolphins, so I guess you could write
thaton the page: “Susie doesn’t have
a tattoo of dolphins.” That’s pretty
rare in this day and age.

Q: Since you’ve started work on
your Ph.D., is it still possible for you
to relate to the other people on your

show? There’s that other show with
the fat girl, and she’s a total disaster-
piece. We doubt she could survive in
a Ph.D. program.

A: Do you even know who the
fat girl is? For that matter, have you
ever watched my show?

Q: Our watching or not watching
your show doesn’t matter, because
we at the Moustache Club of Amer-
ica think you’re really awesome. So
here’s one last question for you: Do
you think we’re really awesome?

A: I did this interview as a favor
to you, so yes. I’m not sure why you
get to do this, but I think it’s great
that you do. You’re a miracle to me,
you truly are.
