reports that over 100 freshmen
have enrolled in the associat_ion

‘this week. With two seminar

groups still unreported, it is es-
timated that over 90 per cent
of the class has registered with
the group.

Joseph Kelley, M42, vice-presi-
dent of the association, stated that
100 per cent membership of En-
gineering and Mines students is
the goal of the present drive, and
that this amount among members
of the freshman class is virtually
assured. Campaign for upper-
class members opens Monday. The
drive for member-ship is conducted
in the weekly department seminar
meetings of students in those
-schools. '

The association, official stu-
dent governing body for. the
schools on the hill, sponsors var-
ious social affairs throughout the
semester and regulates student ac-
tivities.

At present the group is building
a fund for the furnishing of a
smoking lounge for Engineering

With everything to gain and nothing to lose, Pitl.’s unheralded .

football aggregation enters its 1941 season tomorrow afternoon as
underdogs to a strong Purdue eleven. . ‘
However powerful the Boilermakers may be, it is doubtful whether

either Bowser or the team look to this battle with forebodings nearly a

as dire as they did last week before Vanderbilt beat Purdue.
Advance publicity from West Lafayette, lnd., did everything

but call Purdue the wonder team of the nation, and left their oppo-by
nents thinking that they were ‘invincible, but that was taken car-o_;

of by Vanderbilt. ‘

But Coach Bowser has a group of hard ﬁghting, hard blocking, and

hard tackling line to put on the ﬁeld this fall. One that doesn’t
read its opponents’ great and impressive records, nor look up to
its opponents great All-Americans, one that will be hard to stop. "

Neither Coach Elward nor Bowser has cried about the injuries A

that have befallen their teams, and this in itself is a rarity. The closest.

 “The City of Man” A Declaration
[ Fo‘r An ‘Ideal World‘Democra.cy

Democracy, as they understand
it, is in no sense the pragmatic
liberalism we have today. It is
a theoretical state that draws
from St. Augustine many of its
spiritual overtones.

The seventeen men who issued
the Declaration proceed on the as-
sumption that America will enter
the war; and that Hitler will be
defeated. Then, they declare, their
proposal can be applied: the United
States must assume world leader-
ship, and instead of remaining the
United State's of America must in-
corporate itself into the United
States of the World. For there
can be no peace as long as indi-
vidual states continue to exist;
there will be larger and more hor-
rible wars unless the world unites
in a common brotherhood.

Under a common brotherhood
we will learn to respect and un-
derstand one another. There will
be neither scepticism nor nihilism
permitted in the national philos-
ophy; Justice, a word we laugh at,
we must learn to respect and ad-
mire again.

This is only a partial outline of
“The City of Man.” It is a book

worthy of your attention; wheth-

er or not you agree with the ideas

expressed, you should enjoy it as-

Pitt Magazine Contains
Features by Sprigle, King

Pitt, official University maga-
zine, was sent to subscribers to-
day, containing articles ranging.
from a feature on reprints of old
historical letters to modern scien-
tiﬁc research and a Ray Sprigle
item on national defense.

Of greatest importance, accord-
ing to Mrs. Agnes L. Starrett, edi-
tor and assistant professor of Eng-
lish, is an article on scientiﬁc re-
search and training of future sci-
entists. it

The author, Dr. C. ‘G. King,
professor of chemistry, describes
the efforts of local groups to se-
cure and maintain r facilities for
advancing the basic sciences and
for uniting the various specialists
in different ﬁelds. The latest grant

of the Buhl foundation has made-

possible the advances and the pro-
gram outlined by Dr. King.
Tribute to Thyras W. Am-os,
late dean of women, is included
in the October issue of Pitt, with
a statement from Miss Amos fol-
lowed by a brief biography of her.
“Pittsburgh; Stock Room of a

V.

Farﬂung Arsenal" by Ray Sprigle,
staff writer of the Post-Gazette, is
the consensus of 11 reporters who
toured the industrial sections of
the nation early in June.

A new feature of Pitt magazine ‘

will be “The Olden Time,” re-
prints of old letters, journals,
pamphlets, and other material con-

cerned with the early history of
Western Pennsylvania. The title

is the same as that of an old maga-

zine, published about a‘century
ago by Neville B. Craig, a trustee
of the University at that time.
Material from the- Darlington
Memorial library will be used, sup-
plemented by other contributions
of valuable historical papers. Pic-
tures of old scenes, including a
view of the original Western Uni-
versity, accompanies the article.
Frank Carver, director of ath-
letic publicity, previews the Pitt

If you think aboutlit long long
enough, you’ll realize that people
are really taking this national de-
fense business seriously. We had
plenty of time to think about it
while waiting f.or a street-car on
a downtown corner the other day.

In the drug store window in
front of which we were standing,
there was a huge poster, on it a
picture‘ of a little boy and his
mother before a drug store coun-
ter, the little fellow gravely sa-
luting the druggist behind the
counter. -

And there was the druggist——
big fellow, to.o—saluting back. The
lines above the picture read: Mc-
Kesson Products, Home Health De-
fense.

Now that’: really getting con-
scientious about it all. ‘We fore-
see druggists all over the coun-
try, pledging themselves to so.-
lute each and every customer—-
perhaps to include a grim expres-
sion for a. sale amounting to ‘$1,
and a little heel-clicking with pur-
chase of $2 or more. ,

A roll of adhesive tape, for in-
stance, might only rate tapping the
ﬁnger to the forehead, quickly of
course, some time between wrap-
ping the package and ringing up
the sale.

We’ll all be Eagle Scouts before
we known «it.

Glamour Comes i    

W1't_hT_h1'story 

Listen, my children, and ‘you
shall hear what.the' glamour girls
are wearing this Year.

" New and nice is a dress in a
downtown department store that
is a stark white-ground plaid.
It gets an “A” for its tight bo-
dice and dirndl skirt. Plain and
beautiful, and designed to make
even the most jaundiced eye wink
in your direction. '

And an extra jacket that has
the not-so-dumb swearing by it
is a smart version of dad’s old
stand-by-——the smoking jacket. It
comes in velveteen, and has a
braid frog on the pocket.

If you have-a man the army has
ﬁled away in some draft camp for
future reference, show the old
loyal spirit. Grab a pair of these
white wool socks that carry a mili-
tary insignia in blue and red.

For those who can wear ex-
treme fashions and look drama-
tic, there are the exaggerated
snood hats, and wimples are deﬁ-
nitely good this year. lf, how-
ever, you look as though some-
one sat on you slightly in such
headgear, kindly do not indulge
in them. And dry your tears,
’cause there are hats and hats
this season. Some nifties are
those with brims faced with
feathers, and even (for a good
bit ofcash, we admit) some that
are made completely of feath-
ers, and which soften your face
[lines until you look like a movie
star.

Tweed coat excitement is surg-
ing through the stores and cam-
pus in the traditional ﬂood this

fall. Consider y,ou_rse1f .part—icu-g

 

 

larly smart if you manage to snag
a good fabric cut on dressmaker
lines, and be completely sharp in

so one that is unfurred. These coats

will go on being good for many
seasons, which is a fact to rejoice
over these tax-laden, material-
short months. "

Speaking of war, and its influ-
ence on clothes, the bandaged
look is something to seek in ‘a
dress you may be breaking the
piggy bank for soon. This line
is achieved by drapery crisscross-
ed over the hips (only, we beg,
on slender lassies) or over the
bust.

Converts to covert, grab a
street—car or Buick, as the case
may be, and get in to the down-
town department store which is
offering natural tan suits at a truly
remarkable price. The tailoringis
luscious, and the styles make
stronger wills than yours weaken
and buy.

Goody, goody for smooth shoes
that feel nice even on dog-tired
feet (pun intended). And would
you have them in calf or alligator
and cut on military lines? Or do
you prefer high—heeled draped
suedes? Consider, too, the D’or-
say cut now to be had in dress
shoes, which, Allah be praised,
make 8’s look like size 5,,no less!

For keeping-paws-warm pur-

poses, there is a good-looking?
glove that is deﬁnitely not fussy.

It has a single line of fagotting
down its black suede back, and
another runs down the thumb.

Editors Name
Fiction's Best

Dressed Gals

Everyone is familiar with the

annual newspaper listing of the
bestdressed womenin the world.

But what about the beautifully

groomed women in ﬁction? How do
they rate?

Carmel Snow, editor of Harp-
er's Bazaar, has chosen six wom-
en she considers fashion “tops”
in the world of literature. In-
cluded in Mrs. Snow’: list are the
inevitable selections——Rebecca in
Daphane duMaurier’s story of the
same name and Scarlett 0’Hara.

Although the ﬁrst Mrs. De
Winter in the duMaurier book is
never introduced to the reader,
Mrs. Snow, points .out that her
elegance is strikingly revealed in
the scene where Mrs. Danvers
shows Rebecca's wardrobe to the
second wife. The sable wrap, the
chinchilla——-“she could wear any
color, stand any shade”———gold
brocades, wine colored velvet.
She even ‘ died « dashingly, says
Mrs. Snow, in slacks and a shirt.

Scarlett O'Hara in “GWTW” is
another favorite of the well-known
fashion editor. She likes particu-
larly the dress described on the
ﬁrst page; the green ﬂowered mus-
lin which “spread its twelve «yards
of billowing material over ‘her
hoops and exactly matched the
ﬁat-heeled green morocco slip-
pers.”

Other nominations made by Mrs.
Snow are: Fluer Forsythe in Gale-
worthy’s “Forsythe Saga,” Iris
March in “The Green Hat” by
Michael Arlen, O
Gertrude Atherton’s story, “B1ack
Oxen/’, and Madame‘ Ellen Olens-
ka in “The Age of Innocencef’ by
Edith Wharton.

P In the September issue of

Oliver, professor and head of the
history department, has written
an; article outlining America’s ﬁrst

science and government.

Over a 100 years ago a society
of the Columbian institute was
organized in Washington, D. 
to. promote arts and sciences.
“So ambitious was its aim, and
so prie-eminent were its leaders,
that a brief review of this early

caused this society “whose chief M
aim was to promote a arts and.
sciences” to take the character of
a learned organization.

“However, there were a few
tangible results. A valuable min-
eral collection was assembled, cat-
alogued; a real beginning was
made in botanical and horticultur-
al work; rare specimens of trees,
shrubs and plants were collected
from all parts of the country and
used for experimental purposes,
and aided in the establishment of
the United States Naval Observa-
tory.” During the,182lO’s and the
1830’s the group kept alive an
interest in the sciences.

sonian institute.

Dr. Oliver concludes his article
by saying, “due credit should be
given to those who ﬁr-st pioneered
in the ﬁeld of applied science, and
who launched this country into a
study of its scientiﬁc and techno-
logical possibilities, rather than
let it become a poor imitation of

the literary and esthetic cultures
of the Old World.”

 by Striking Them with Lightning

7» At last a new/main bites dog
»angle———the Cathedral of ‘Learning
can strike the clouds with lighting
just as lightning can strike the
Cathedral. In a laboratory on the
roof of the building, the Westing-
house Electric and Manufacturing
Company is investigating the hab-
its of lightning. ‘ _
~ Pitt's tall building can pay back
blow for blow, according to Pro-

 ifessor Howard D. Dyche, head of

the electrical engineering depart-
ment. He says:

I Sans ‘Complications

“When lightning strikes a tree
or building, we speak of it as an
electrical discharge from the
clouds, But strangely enough the
Cathedral tests show that some-
times an electrical dist:ha.1'ge arises
from the Cathedral to strike a
cloud.” ,
, Having a vital bearing on na-
tional defense, the studies are
nowpin their third season.

It is simple enough to under-
-stand, says Professor Dyche. “All
lightning is the discharge of two
electrically charged bodies of
which the clouds can be one and
the trees, or the
ground can be the other. The point
’>‘rof origin can be in either one.
When a spark is struck, that’s what
we call lightning.

‘I Cathedral — Ideal

“These earth-bound charges
. arewhat we call ‘leader strokes,”
A hetells. "“They rise to meet the
oncoming discharge from cloud
- formations to complete the stroke.
Low or high flying clouds at dif-
ferent seasons of the year, as well
. as varyingihigh structures, seem
to determine whether the light-
ning will start from the cloud or
from the building.”
For these studies, the 530 foot
height of the Cathedral seem pref-
erable to taller structures. Tests

{show that the height seems to be

on an atmospheric borderline be-
tween very high buildings.-and the
ground.

Lightning Strikes Often

The Westinghouse investigations
have also proved the inaccuracy of
the old adage: Lightning can and
often does strike more than once
in the same place.

Pitt’s lightning trap can take
it. In»-the summer of 1939, shortly
after the apparatus was set up,

‘ the machine recorded the first com-
pletely measured direct hit in his-
. ptory, and more remarkably the ﬁrst

published last Wednesday, the BI
called the University’s news sheet
"the most professional of local
college papers.” ’

Describing the News’ new form
as “brand-new snapping tabloid
format,” the lxidex went on to
tell of the News’ somewhat shady‘
past but in very gentle terms.

The Index went on to relate
the story of last year’s editor
Ruggero A1disert’s successful cam-
paign among other college news-

.«. papers to prevent‘, editorial space

being monopolized by plugs for
certain advertisers.

In a list of University gradu-
ates, who have gotten local jour-
nalistic work the BI named an
impressive group of well-known
ex~News writers. They were:
Maxine Garrison, John Palus, Ed-
die Beacher, Leo Koeberlein ,and
Bill McElwain, who all work for
the Press; Bill Theis, now Penn-
sylvania manager for Internation-
al News service; Robert Brown,
BI business editor, now a cavalry-
man at Fort Meyer; Sidney Eigie,
now associate director of publicity
for NBC; and Norman Park, now
director, ‘of publicity for Gulf _loiL

 

Dr. Shelton I

Finds Rise

In Linguists
Dr. Whitford H. Shelton, pro-

fessor and head of the department
of modern languages, today re-

vealed a. further increase in the

enrollment in Spanish courses
when he released revised enroll-
ment ﬁgures in the modern lan-
guage department.

The amazing spurt in the num-
ber of students taking Spanish
courses became evident when he

lannounced that 46 new students

had been added to those enrolled

up to last Tuesday.

The total enrollment of the
whole department was boosted to
1036 students, an increase of 10
per cent over last year’s ﬁgures
of 952 students.

Dr. Shelton announced" that it
could not. yet be determined
whether the enrollment will re-
mainconstant, ‘or whether a fur-
ther increase will result from the
transfer of students from other
classes.

7 Two ‘theories were advanced

tremendous: increase in ~ Spanish

West gained experience in the

last few games of the season last
year when he replaced Mike Se-
kela. Reserves ,for West are

Walter Ward, and Ralph Ham-

mond.

The fullback position"will ﬁnd
Johnny Ross, capable line plunger
from Ellsworth high school. Ross
will be ﬁlling George Kracuni’s
shoes, and although he does not
have Kracum’s defensive qualities,
Ross should be able to pick up
yardage just as easily.

At the halfback position, Pur-
due will face either Stetler or
Jones on the left side, and Bill
Dutton on the right side.

, Stetler has been the sensation of
‘fall drills, and may get the nod
over Edgar Jones. Both boys are
adept at throwing the ball, and
, there is a possibility that the air

Stan Gervelis is the only vet-
eran lineman sure of a starting

and Fife's injury may be cause
for Antonelli’s starting.

Here’s What Pitt, Purdue

Have To Offer Tomorrow

For the second consecutive year,
Pitt’s ‘Golden Panthers will enter
their opening game of the season
as underdogs. Last year it was the
powerhouse Ohio State eleven, and
this year it is against the formid-
able Purdue Boilermakers.

Local interest in the ‘Panther
team runs both high and low; some
think that the Pitt team is on the
down grade a la Tech, while some
have hopes of it being the surprise
squad of the year.

With good weather, the turn-
stiles should see a capacity crowd.

The probable lineups are as fol-
lows: ' ‘ﬂu

Former Pitt Sports Editor
TaI<es Position on Press

Alex Zelenski, who succeeded
McElwain as sports editor, ex-
pressed the general campus sen-
timent when he said, “Mac was a
great guy to work for. He was
one person who not only wrote
sports, but he knew his sports. I
don't see how he can fail to be
anything but a great success on
the Pittsburgh Press."

McElwain did not, however, con-
ﬁne his talents to writing sports
alone.‘ ‘He was extremely versa-
tile, beingian excellent student,
and-quite gifted in the ﬁeld of dra-
matics. He was president of Pitt
Players and a member of Thea-
tron, honorary dramatic society.
He was tapped to ODK and was
elected to Pitt’s Hall of Fame. Mc-
Elwain was also very active in the
Independent party which he head-
ed in 1939.

Football Candidates

Freshman coach Nick Klisky
announced today that the first call
for freshmen football volunteers
will be issued Monday afternoon
and asks all candidates to report
to gate 3 of the Stadium for
equipment; eligibility and examin-
ation cards will be ﬁlled out then.

Since the abolition of freshmen
intercollegiate sports, the Panthers
enter the second year under ad-
herence to Big Ten standards. The
decision to operate under Western
Conference rules was reached by
Pitt officials two years ago. So,
look forward to
plenty of action in intra-squad
games.

Konetsky New Coach

All ﬁrst year men are urged by
James Hagan, director of athletics,
to take advantage of the oppor-
tunity of undergoing a thorough

trial. Every man out will be un-
der the watchful eyes of Kliskey,
the backﬁeld coach, and Ted

Konetsky, the new line coach. Ko-
netsky will always be remember-
ed as one of Pitt’s outstanding
men in the forward wall, who last
season ﬁnished his collegiate foot-
ball career in a blaze of glory.

In line with the freshman
sports policy, there will be no
handpicked squad, and every as-
pirant will be afforded an equal
chance to demonstrate his talent.
To further provide incoming
gridsters with opportunity to
make good, Kliskey states that the
squad will not be pared down
and every candidate will be re-
tained throughout the fall sea-
son.

After a thorough schooling in

be divided into as many teams as
are necessary to take care of
everyone. These teams will then
start playing against each other
so that the boys can put theory in-
to practice. About ﬁve or six
teams are anticipated by the coach-
es since sixty to one hundred men
are expected. Lack of high school
experience does not eliminate any
candidate, for some gridsters have
made good in their collegiate whirl
without previous experience. Frank
Kristufek attained stardom as a
tackle on the 1939 varsity machine
without any high school record.
No one would know about him to-
day if it hadn’t been for his deci-
sion to try out even though he

didn't realize then his potential’

ability.
Infra-Squad Only

The lack of freshman inter-
collegiate competition will not
hinder the Pitt teams of the fu-
ture to any great extent, it was
explained by the coaching staff.
Head coach Charley Bowser said
that three years of varsity par-
ticipation by any individual
should provide plenty of good,
hard football. The first season
should be devoted, he stated, to
getting the new players acquaint-
ed to the Pitt system of play.

Coach Bowser promises that the
new player’s efforts will not go un-
noticed by him. Pitt’s chief of
staff is vitally concerned with the
progress of the fresh squad be-
cause it is through his advice and
inspiration, with the help of his
assistants, that the men who make
up its teams now are the ones who
must be ready to step into varsity

fundamentals, the new men will positions in the near future.

extra-mild Camels, there is less nicotine. (See ‘above, right.)

Ready For

Inaugural

The panther, that brown furred
ﬁgure that stands on his head and
generally amuses the fans at foot-
ball games, will be inhabited by
Cyril J. Donoghue, Ed43, this year.

Last year’s mascot was Larry
Pierce, who held the job for a long
time. But when Pierce graduated
from medical school last year,
Donoghue was named by Coach
Ben Grady to take his place. ‘-

Cyril has promised to make an
entertaining mascot. He willrtry
to make his antics and screamls-th?:
most fascinating seen and heard at
Pitt games.

The panther suit is the four-
year-old property of the athletic
department.

At the same time that he
named the mascot, Coach Grady
listed the names of the cheer-
leaders. They are: Aldo Icardi,
C43, head cheerleader; Bill Mc-
Cafferty, C43, Buzz Yolton,
BA44, Art Clarke, E44, and
Chuck Fusco, C45.

Serving as alternates will be
Bob Miller, E43, and Ed Guiliani,
E44.

Icardi will replace Dick Sonnen-
feld, who graduated last year.
Icardi announces that the team of
cheerleaders has prepared a whole
new series of cheers and drills for
the Purdue game Saturday.

“With the proper cooperation of
the student body and the cheering
section, this promises to be a good
year,” says Icardi.

Kliskey Calls Frosh P1'ﬂ‘M<1SC0i‘ Panthers Will Equal Any
Opponent--Coach Bowser

with the suddenly rediscovered T
1'01-mation on the Panther Squad:
this season. It does not, accord-
ing to Bowser, fit in with the Pan-

the unknown in quality as well awther p1ans_

quantity, insofar as coach Charley
Bowser is concerned. He declined
to hazard any predictions on the
possible strength or weakness of
the team, other than to say that
this year’s team was particularly
hard to judge.

 

There are only four men left
from last year’s squad and only
nineteen lettermen in all. The rest
are inexperienced newcomers,
where the ﬁrst team is concerned,
who have yet to prove themselves
on the varsity.

This year's schedule which, if
names have anything to do with
it, should have more box office
appeal than the Dionne Quintup-
lets, Clark Cable, or Hedy La-
Marr in a bathing suit, brought
only the admission from Bowser
that “it is indeed a hard one, but
I feel sure that Pitt is only play-
ing teams of her own caliber.”

YES, DOROTHY VAN NUYS, and the important point
is: Camel’s extra coolness—and other Camel advantages
are in the smoke. After all,
in the smoke of the slower-burning’ cigarette of costlier
tobaccos there's more coolness, more ﬂavor, extra mild-

The coach scoffed at the reports
in the dailies that have hinted that,
judging from the lack of pre-sea-
son ballyhoo eminating from the
Hill, the Panthers must, be ready-
ing a secret attack to spring on
their unsuspecting opponents. “We
have no secrets,” he stated. “Any
one who wants to watch the team
has only to climb the hill.” Only,
Mr. Bowser. Or haven’t you ever
climbed that hill?

The only comment Bowser
would make concerning thg ,
chances of the team was that

"after two and one half weeks
of practice I think we have an
outﬁt that will equal that of any
of our opponents.”

When asked what he, himself,
expected of the team, Bowser
merely stated that “expectations
are only hopes, and, of course, we
always hope for the best.”

not even remotely connected with

erything from how the lawn is

these trees have an interesting

‘Ohio State university following
the football game in 1929. Last
July a cedar tree from Lebanon
was planted as part of the Syria-
Lebanon room dedication.

The evergreen plantings are a A

and crabapple trees add color to
the campus.

Hospital Drive

Today is the last day for pay-
ment of student hospitalization
fees, announced Dr. H. C. Carl-
son, director of Men’s Student
Health service, but added that this
applies only to students who live
in the city. A

Out-of-town students, he said,
have until October 8 to pay their
fees.

Students who did not obtain a
hospitalization policy during reg-
istration wedk may do so at eith-
er of the health service offices.

Payment of the $2.50 fee en-
titles any student to accommoda-
tion in the larger Pittsburgh hos-

pitals for a total of 21 days in the
school year.

In addition, the student may
have the use of the operating room
as often as necessary and anesthe-
sia, ordinary drugs, medications,
dressings, and routine laboratory
and x-ray service.

Dr. Lanfear
Gives Talk

At a joint meeting of the Pitts-
burgh Chamber of Commerce and
the Junior Chamber of Commerce
last night, Dr. Vincent W. Lanfear,.
dean of the School of -Business Ad-
ministration, discussed “Living
Costs and Price Control.”

Answering important questions
on the nature‘ and possibility of
inﬂation, Dr. Lanfear said that
the trend toward or from inflation
will depend upon the duration of
the war and certain adequate an-

of the

ti-inflationary measures

government.

The period from 1939 to l94l_
has been very similar to that of
1914-16, he stated, showing that
a brief increase followed by a lev-
eling off was the forerunner of

great rises in the price structure.
Citing the weak step of the ad-
ministration in placing a limit’ on
only 30 commodities, he pointed
out that the government had re-
stricted 573 such commodities by
the end of World War I.

According to Dr. Lanfear,
three anti-inﬂationary steps taken
by the administration in the last
month- are: broadening the in-
come tax base by lowering ex-
emptions; presidential veto of bill
to withhold cotton and wheat
from market; and action of the
Federal Reserveboard concerning
installment credit. A

Although not certain of the wis-
dom of Bernard Baruch’s sugges-
tion to freeze all prices, he admit-
ted, however, that unless pr.oduc-
tion can be increased immensely
and a large part of present pur-
chasing power diverted from con-
sumer demand, extreme measures
mar  :9. he. put gmto fozzce.

Devitis Reveals Feelings 
In South American States,

“There is more opposition to
US policies in South America.than
is ever permitted to be published
in any newspaper in the United
States."

So asserted M. A. Devitis, as-
sociate professor of modern lan-
guages, and authority on South
American affairs.

Devitis says that even in coun-
tries where the inﬂuence of citi-
zens of German or Italian ancestry
or birth is not prevalent, such as it
is in Argentina, there is consider-
able opp.osition to the attempt of
the Roosevelt administration to
unite all the nations of Latin
America in a solid bloc under US
against the dictatorships.

Citing the example of the tiny
but infinitely important republic
of Panama, he points to the bel-
‘ ligerent remarks of its president,
Arias, in a recent speech when he
slapped the face of the United
States by saying that Panama
wanted no interference in its ex-
ternal or internal affairs either
by forces without or within the
western hemisphere.

Remarking that after all the

Teagarden Book

“Child Psychology for Profes-

60 most outstanding education
books of”1940, was written by a
university graduate, Dr. Florence
Teagarden, professor of psych.ol-
ogy.

The announcement was made to-
day by the National Education as-
sociation. ‘

Dr. Teagarden delivered a series
of addresses and conducted con-
ferences with nurses and social
workers at Mills college, Califor-
nia, last summer.
during the pr.ogram of the annual
study conference of the Associa-

tiom For Childhood Education in.

Inferring that the president of
Panama didn't know on which
side its bread was buttered, De-
vitis asserted that the population
of Panama would starve within a’
week, were it not for the trade
which is carried on in the Ganal
Zone by the United States. A
