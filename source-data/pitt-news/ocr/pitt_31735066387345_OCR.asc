NewIDs

All current students must
have their photos_ retaken for
the new identification system
to be used beginning next
term. -

After January 1988, current
ID cards will become invalid
for all university privileges ex-
cept housing services.

The university’s primary rea-
son for the conversion is effi-
ciency.

The new, white ID cards
will have a bar code similar to
those used to price grocery
items. This bar code will even-
tually be able to interface with
other university systems such
as library computers.

The previous system re-
quired three to six weeks to
process an ID card, but now
they will be internally

WASHINGTON — President
Reagan said Monday the super-
powers still face ”difficult issues”
before reaching an arms agree-

ment, and the White House cau-_

tioned it was unlikely a missile
accord or summit date would

result from talks with Soviet For- ‘

eign Minister Edvard ‘Shevard-
nadze this week.

On the eve of Shevardnadze’s
visit to the White House, Reagan
instructed U.S. negotiators ll.)
present a new draft treaty on i; '-
termediate range forces, known
as INF. It calls for elimination of
all medium-range nuclear mis-
siles, with a range of about 600
to 3,000 miles, within three
years, and abolishing shorter-
range missiles, with a range of
about 300 to 600 miles, within
one year. -

The Soviets have proposed a
timetable of five years for dis-

mantling medium-range weapons _

and one-year for shorter—range
missiles. _
”With these new actions taken

by the United States, it is now up- »
to the Soviet Union to demon-_

strate whether or not it truly
wants to conclude _.a, treaty

 

eliminating this class of missiles,”
Reagan said in a speech to the
National Alliance of Business.
He said the proposed treaty
contained the toughest-ever
measures against cheating — a
fact the administration cited in
minimizing chances for an immi-
nent announcement on a missile
accord or superpower summit.
Reagan's speech and the new

lower the chance of accidental
war.

‘Accompanied by Shultz, Rea-
gan will confer with Shevard-
nadze in the Cabinet Room and
then meet with him over lunch.

Shevardnadze and Shultz then
will go back to the State Depart-
ment for more talks and confer
again Wednesdayand Thursday.

treaty draft set the stage for three
days of meetings between
Shevardnadze and Secretary of

be crucial to the fate of an INF

Shultz and Shevardnadze will

BAGHDAD, Iraq -— Iraq's for-
eign minister said Iran failed to
respond to a United Nations call
for a cease-fire and has asked the
visiting U.N. chief to take ”puni-
tive measures” against war foe
Iran, Baghdad Radio reported.

Both Iran and Iraq traded accu-
sations of starting new fighting
today.

U.N. Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar is seeking to get

i the Persian Gulf neighbors, at war

since September 1980, to imple- "
ment a July 20 Security Council

resolution calling for cease—fire.

He arrived in Baghdad on Sun-
day night following two days of
talks with top Iranian leaders in
Tehran, and today met with For-
ei.gn Minister Tarik Aziz.

Iraq has said it will abide by the
resolution if Iran will, but Iran has
announced no decision on the
resolution.

’ Iranian leaders told Perez de
Cuellar the United Nations had to
brand Iraq as the aggressor and
punish it before there could be
any settlement of the war. Irani-

an President Ali Khamenei em-
phasized this again on Sunday.

At the Pentagon in Washing-
ton, officials released a statement
today announcing that a new
convoy operation began Sunday,
with two U.S. Navy warships es-
corting three tankers from the
Gulf of Oman into the Persian
Gulf.

Meanwhile, another convoy of
U.S.-escorted tankers left the gulf
today after making the journey
from Kuwait in record time.

Iraq's official news agency
quoted a military spokesman as
saying Iran launched a new Offen-
sive in the Central sector of the
730-mile battlefront after mid-
night Sunday. NO details were
given.

Semester at Sea a worldly learning experience II

By Kerri Hamilton
For The Pitt News

A Semester at Sea is more than

- just another semester of college.

It's an opportunity for students to
get hands—on experience with the
problems, the people, the culture
and the issues of the world.

The voyage around the world
takes place on a ship called the
S.S. Universe. It's an 18,000 ton,
floating university. The ship is
complete with everything from
classrooms, library, bookstore
and student union to a dining
room, a hospital and several sport
facilities including a swimming
pool and volleyball court.

Semester at Sea is offered twice
a year: during the fall term from
September through December
and the spring term from January
until May.

While at sea, the student will
spend 50 percent of his or her
time on board the ship and the

' other 50 percent in the countries

of call. Port calls range from 3 to
7 days. They give the student the
opportunity to explore the
country. '

The complete voyage takes stu-
dents to 10 countries, including
Spain, Yugoslavia, the Soviet Un-
ion, Turkey, India and Malaysia.

The academic program on
board is based on the University
of Pittsburgh's curriculum. The
credits earned while on board the
ship will be put on the student's
permanent record and will be ap-
plied toward graduation.

The classes meet every day ex-
cept Sunday. The courses that the
students take on board help them

 

to become both personally and
academically ready to explore
each new culture as the ship
moves from one country to the
next.

”The benefits of taking a
Semester at Sea are numerous.
The student gains a sense of
global interdependence,” ac-
cording to Dr. Angie Yucas,
director of the Study Abroad
Office, at the University of
Pittsburgh.

Yucas said she believes that the
student receives great personal
benefits from taking this trip —
they become more self-sufficient,
and it really helpsto develop
their interpersonal skills.

”Those who participate on this
voyage get exposed to so much.
They see how countries have
military impact on one another.
They see firsthand what Third
World countries are all about.
They uncover so muchabout the
world in such a short period of
time that many students think of
their experience at sea for many
years to come,” said Yucas.

The courses offered on the ship
are carefully chosen to help en-

hance the student's learning 'ex- »

perience. The core course is
specially designed to intensify the
awareness of the student to the
world, and its many different cul-
tures and beliefs. The core course
is required of all students because
it is vital that they gain an under-
standing of the complexity of the
world, according to the guide-
lines of the program.

As well as taking the core
course, students have a wide

th

 

 

  

‘The Tl—74 offers BASIC programming

range of other classes offered
from which to choose. They offer
anthropology, biological
sciences, business, including
several international business
classes, communications and
economics, as well as fine arts,
geography, geology, history and
literature. In addition, they also
offer psychology, religous sudies,
sociology and theater arts.

”|ts curriculum is steered
toward those individuals who are
interested in any international
field. It's for anyone who wants
to become a more well-rounded
person,” said Yucas.

While on board, the students
can take part in various clubs or
organizations such as Students of
Service, Ambassador's Student
Council, Choir, Drama Club, the
student newspaper The Helm

and the student yearbook, The
Aft. There are social activities
such as dances, musical pro-
grams and fundraising events that
are organized for international
projects.

”There’s always something go-
ing on; Someti_mes there is too
much to do and not enough time
to do it all,” said Chris Smerdel,
A Pitt student who took the trip
spring term 1987. ”A lot of stu-
dents really got into working out.
This program has so much to
offer,” said Smerdel.

Semester at Sea is a once in a

‘lifetime event. ”What appealed

to me most was the different
countries we were exposed to.
There was so much variety. The
thought of it really gets my blood
pumping,” said Smerdel.

No fantasy
for woman
aﬁer 
breakup

Q‘; Since my boyfriend and I
broke up, I haven't been able to
fantasize or pleasure myself. It
has been over a year now. Is it
normal to be so upset that one
can't even daydream about sex

i for so long?

A: It shows that the relationship
really was serious for you, and
that is nothing to worry about.
The period of mourning after
such a breakup is different for
different people. Don't try to
force yourself to have pleasurable
or arousing fantasies in order to
gain sexual release because
daydreams won't come to you on
command. They are soft, self-
indulgent experiences, and they
need leisure.

DR. RUTH

WESTHEIMER .

Just give yourself a relaxing '

hour or even 15 minutes every
day, taking a bubble bath, listen-
ing to soothing music, thinking
about scenes you like or sounds
you like to hear, wearing pretty
and comfortable indoor clothes,
and so forth; read some nice and
sexy novel — in short, be nice to

yourself and let daydreams enter 8

your head as far as they want to
come. Think of some big wonder-
ful hero and dream — not of hav-
ing sex but oftraveling with him,
going places on his arm, just
generally delicious ideas.
' Q: We have been going around
together for two months. Some-
times he comes to my place,
sometimes I visit his. We have
known each other for 12 years,
and for many of those, we were
married to other people. Now we
~ are both single. He has asked me
to go on a weekend trip with
him. Would this be wise?
A: Why not? you like each
other, you are both free. This
weekend might be the beginning

of a wonderful new level of.

friendship. Take him up on it.

Hypocrisy and the

pursuit of power

How we all love a good fight. Right now, the fires‘ of ideo-
logical debate are raging all over the country, fueled by Rea-
gan's appointment ofludge Robert Bork to the Supreme Court.

The lines have been drawn, the armies briefed, the sharpened
rhetoric brought to the ready. All this, as a nationally syndicat-
ed columnist recently pointed out, for a man whose lifetime
appointment is designed to put him above the political fray.

It seems important, at this point, to remember that since his
nomination, Bork has released no public statement. Until he
has had a chance to speak on his own behalf, the debate should
center on questions concerning the validity of an ideological-
ly motivated protest, rather than the man himself, if any sem-
blance of integrity is to be maintained.

But sadly, integrity has never been a strong point of the cur-
rent president and senate.

‘The rationale behind a senatorial confirmation of presiden-
tial appointees is that of checking the balance of power within
the government. In the eyes of the liberals, the court would
be shifted too far to the right should Bork be approved. The
right, conversly, believe that Bork would be a welcome addi-
tion to a court too long in left field.

An argument has been advanced by the right—wing support-
ers of Bork, charging the libera'ls with exactly that for which
they are condemning the president. The argument goes some-
thing like this: If the liberals are opposed to.Bork because his
political and judicial convictions embrace those associated with
conservatism, they are using exactly the same reasoning em-
ployed by Reagan in Bork’s appointment — except they hap-
pen to have a different view of the possible good to come of
the appointment.

To our minds, this argument carries a lot of weight.

Which is not to say weapprove of Bork. He should be evalu-
ated by members of the senate, hopefully members who have
managed to retain‘ open minds, and a decision should be made
based on those hearings. ‘

Outcry on either side on issues such as abortion and the death,

penalty may produce some eloquent reading, but has no place
in this debate.

The senate is charged with seeing that _a fair and open-minded
person sits on the Supreme Court. Open-minded does not neces-
sarily imply any specific political leaning. It merely suggests
that a person has not made up his or her mind without hearing
all the evidence.

The evidence on Bork is far from complete, and a judgment
now is not only hypocritical, it is profoundly dangerous to the
continued freedom that each side seems to assume it embraces.

So what are ya gonna do?

I'm sure you've heard at least
some of the little quips about it.
”Ha, ha. Before long we'll have
to be parking right in front of Pos-
var’s desk,” is one that readily
pops into mind. ‘

All lightly humorous and all
jokes. Unless you have a car.

In the last few months (since
April to be exact), I have been
blessed with the opportunities of:
1. Finding out the hard way that,
while living on Bates Street, I
needed a section ”D” parking
permit. 2. Finding that even with
that permit, I could only park
there when it was not streetclean—
er day. 3. That even when it was
not streetcleaner day, if there was
a special event going on, such as
ajmajor concert at the Mosque or
what I think was a religious
revival of some sort in the area,
I still couldn't park there because
the infamous and never seen
”they” needed the space for their
dancing girls’ and trained squids’
trucks!

I have since moved from Bates

Street to the other side of town on
Melwood Avenue. Imagine the

 

 

 

CHRISTOPHER
SEPESY

sense of relief I experienced
when I found out the street was
a no‘-permit zone! Ah, blessed
day! No more phone messages
from mother doing a pretty good
impression of Lady Valhalla
screaming about another viola-
tion which I never even knew I
had!

Unless, of course, it was a day
like yesterday which CBS decid-
ed to-film a TV movie at the Luna
starring Suzanne Pleshette and
they needed the space for their

warnings from the city that they
were going to be doing this.

You know, the city has a pret-

ty good racket going here, don't, - ‘V 
they? You're allowed to be con-, A.
cerned about your car, just don't

attempt to park it anywhere
where you won't have to sell
your first-born to pay the toll, or

whereyou know it is~saf‘e~-and v if
easily accessible. I.f you do, you'll “ S

be sorry.

I wonder, do all meter—people,
perhaps because with their posi-
tion comes an inflated sense of
importance, steal away behind
trees when you park your car and
then cautiously wait for the little
red ”time expired” flag to pop
up?

It is time for the glorious city of
Pittsburgh, once and for all, to
stop the parking lottery they have
and set up a responsible system,
especially here in Oakland.

Until then, fie on meter—maids!,

When morals meet safety

Hurray for UPB (Pitt Bradford)
for installing a condom vending
machine. Their action shows that
they are health conscious and
concerned for their students. So
where is ours? '

A condom machine on our
campus is needed. We also care
about the health of our students,

’ don't we? I realize that the ad-

ministration is concerned with
what they may consider the im-
plications that a condom vending
machine brings to our campus.

I'd like to address a few that they‘

may be concerned with.

I. Condom machines en-
courage premarital sex.

Sorry. Students will have sex
anyway, condom machines or
not. However, condom machines
may encourage safer sex. But just
in ‘case you don't take my word
for that, I take‘ the example of
cigarette vending machines (like

the one in the Toyvers lobby)_. _.I
 doubt’ that ‘as I

 

‘_am lwalking“

  

LETTERS

through the Towers lobby I will
see that cigarette machine and
suddenly start smoking just be-
cause the machine is there.

That machine is there for the
convenience of students who
want to smoke. Yes, they could
walk that block to the 7-1 I to get
a pack, but the machine is there
when they want a pack. One
could argue that without a
cigarette machine present, the
walk to the corner is a deterrent
to those who wish to smoke; but
unfortunately, the absence of a
condom machine is not a deter-
rent for those who wish to have
sex. V

2. Condom machines should

not belocated in public places_
I, because itlooks bad. So where

do you put them?

« ‘..- ‘%‘:?':..-. ~

_;':;-;:,‘7,¢;,;::-__ —.  .4

question we should be asking,
not because of the presence of a

sightly but where is the machine

most successfully going to serve '

its purpose. I suggest the men's
and women's rooms at the stu-

dent union. This is not the ulti- I

mate spot, however, since the
union is not frequented by every-
one, but none of the dorms have
one public restroom.

I have to stress that the wom— ‘
en's room has a need for a con- ‘
dom vending machine, too. '

Women are concerned with safe _

sex. ‘

Ihope this letter ofconcern for _ ’

Pitt students is taken seriously by
the administration and the stu-
dents themselves. Safer sex is an
important part of life today;
without it, there. may be no

_3y Ike Shibley

Staff Writer

”/have seen the future of horror
 his name is Clive Barker.”
Stephen King

newest-member'of'the hor- ‘

féror genre to gain notoriety is
‘Clive Barker, an Englishman
who, until recently, has been a
novelist.

His writing credits include six
volumes in a series entitled Books
ofBIood. He has also completed
two novels, The Damnation
Game and Weaveworld, the lat-
ter of which should be available
in America within the next few
weeks.

Barker got his start in the realm
of horror in 1981 when he was
using horror stories ”as a diver-

_sion from ‘real writing.’ ” The sto-
ries became so lucrative that he
happily decided to make a career
of it. -

On Sept. 18 his first film will be
unveiled. It is called Hellraiser
and was taken loosely from his
own short story ”The Hell-Bound
Heart.” Barker wrote the screen-
play and directed this newest edi-

tion to horror cinema.

The movie is described by Bar-

. _l<er as a love story, and in a sense,
it is. However a more adequate
description might be a lust story,
for this is the impetus for the hor-
rible events that occur.

._The scenario is basically this:
Man unleashes demons (possibly
spawned in hell); demons kill

man; man escapes demons and 1

needs blood to regain human
form; former lover lures men for
him to kill; demons get loose and
’want man back; frantic, hair-
raising conclusion ensues.

The purpose of the preceding
scenario was to show that the sto-
ry itself is not that terrifying if
reduced to such simplistic terms.
Fortunately Barker does not tell
the story the way 1 have. He adds
much detail and much more
emotion to the basic premise. He
tells it well enough to scare the
hell out of the viewer.

 'Kisy Ashle Laurece) comes face to face with terrifying truths of the demoniclworld.
 Hell raiser .  
   The search for ultimate pleasure

The special effects crew, all 16
of them, did a remarkable job.
The trio of demons, called Ceno-
bites, were interesting if not al-
ways horrifying.

All three of them were quite
different, indicating that Barker is
unsure of what the creatures from
hell look like. One is a blob who
wears glasses; one is bald with an
oversized skull who has a hook
for a hand, and one has literally
hundreds of straight pins protrud-
ing from his countenance and
skull.

Another intriguing effect was
the body of Frank (who was the
one who released the hellish
forces that killed him) which

slowly regained human form with
each sanguine ingestion. Bones
were evident through flesh and
his entire body was constantly co-1
vered with blood.

When Julia, Frank's ex-lover,
first sees the grotesque shape that
Frank is in, he tells her not to look
at him. Despite the fact thatjulia
turns away, the audience is
forced (perhaps compelled is a
more accurate verb) to look at
him. That request is the essence
of the film. ‘

The viewer is watching some-
thing that he would rather not.
The images are horrifying. When
Frank tells Julia not to look, there
is a sudden desire on the part of

 

the viewer to heed him. Many
probably covered their eyes to
avoid the sight, but most likely,
many of them parted their two
fingers to get a glimpse. Despite
the fact that one doesnot want to
watch, the attention has been
captured, and Barker does not
release his grasp.

Most of the characters in the
filmare unsavory. Frank is selfish
and egotistical; Julia is unhappy
in her marriage and is is quite
bitchy in her disgust for her hus-
band, Larry; Larry displays such
naivete that he is not even pitied
for having married such a un-
pleasant woman.

This is not a tale in which the

Accuuncture goes atray as this Cenobite pays for leasure.

horror arises because one dreads
to see what happens to ”the good
guys” because there really are
none. Larry's daughter Kirsty is
the -closest the film gets to a
heroine, but she is not developed

' enough for the viewer to have an

affiliation with her. 2

The film is riveting because-of
the pure demonic quality of it.
Seeing the keepers of hell wreak
havoc on the material world is ut-
terly appetizing —- or unappetiz—
ing depending on your point of
view. Barker captivates the au-

' dience because of the evil in the

film, not the good.
The Cenobites are not the only

For The Pitt News

As the song goes, ”it’s been
such a long time ...” Well, it
has, and in more ways than
one.

First of all, it has been more
than 10 years since Pittsburgh
has been graced by the
presence of the band Boston.
They will play only a few dates
on their tour this year, and
Pittsburgh was lucky enough
to get two of those.

Secondly, it has been a
while since a plain old rock ’n’
roll band played in town
without all of the hype, glitter
and 13-year-old fans that many
big acts rely on today. They
came to town and put on sim-
ply one of the best rock ’n’ roll
shows the city has seen or

A heard.

If you went to hear the new
material, you heard all of it. If
you went for the older materi-
al like I did, you heard most of
that as well. From the opener
”Rock and'Roll Band,” an ap-
propriate tune for the band
and the evening, they went
into classics such as ”Piece of

Boston comes back

Mind,” ”Don’tbLook Back”
and ”More than a Feeling.”

It was here that they played
the entire Third Stage album.
They exited the stage only to
come back to a 10 minute
standing ovation.

This got the crowd going for .
the four encores that they
played, which included crowd
favorites like ”Fore-
play/Longtime” and ”Hitch a
Ride.” .

The music sounded fantas-
tic, the energy levels were
high, and the enthusiasm
among the crowd was very
evident. There were those
concerned that it just wouldn't
sound right with only two of
the original members, but
those two, guitarist and band
leader Tom Scholz and
vocalist Brad Delp, are the two
who gave Boston it's own dis-
tinctive sound in the first
place.

1 The performance was flaw-
less, and it will be a long time
before Pittsburghers will be
able to attend a rock ’n’ roll
show with as much quality as
this one had.

Easy, from Breathless directorlim
McBride, takes a different ap-
proach to the subject.

Set in New Orleans, nick-
named ”The Big Easy” for its
relaxed, always-ready-for-a-party
attitude, the film focuses on the
progessive nature of corruption.
Virtually every cop on the New
Orleans police force is involved
in the minor indiscretions which

we have come to take for grant-
ed, such as exchanging protec-
tion for money from local
businesses, or breaking traffic
laws unnecessarily.

Even our protagonist, detective
Remy McSwain (Dennis Quaid of
Breaking Away and The Right
Stuff) is guilty of being on the
take.

Although police corruption
serves as the core of the movie,
a romance between Quaid and a
repressed district attorney, played
by Ellen Barkin (Diner, Desert
Bloom), provides a tantalizing
subplot.

The film's only notable short-
comings occur toward the end
when it attempts to be an action

thriller. At this point, it lapses into
predictability and slips out of
tempo with the rest of the movie.

However, The Big Easy suc-
ceeds wholeheartedly both as a
police corruption saga and as a
realistic yet stimulating romance.
In addition, it should at long last
establish both Dennis Quaid and
Ellen Barkin as forces to be reck-
oned with in Hollywood.

THE PITT NEWS

Walker show

By Sam Tallarico
Assistant Sports Editor

It seems like only yesterday that
Pitt had cornered the market of
running backs with plenty of
potential —— Charles Gladman,
Brian Davis, Eugene Napolean,
A.B. Brown a_nd Craig Heyward.
Needless to say, only Heyward is
still here.

Gladman was ruled ineligible
for failing to cooperate with the
NCAA in regard to dealing with
sports agent Norby Walters. Da-
vis was academically ineligible
and Brown and Napolean trans-
ferred to West Virginia
University. ‘

Pitt's running back corps
looked to be in serious trouble
but there were and still are a few
young backs who are willing to

make Pitt fans forget the past and .

look forward to the future.
Adam Walker, a sophomore

from Steel Valley High School,

came ‘ off the bench in the

Brigham Young game in Provo‘

and carried three times for only
two yards, but that included
seven yards on one of the carries.
Then, just this past Saturday,
came North Carolina State.
_ Walker showed the home fans
what he is capable of doing.
Although seeing limited playing

time, Walker rushed seven times ‘

for 77 yards, four of which were
12 yards ‘or more. He runs a
4.5—second 40-yard dash and has
proven that he can play. All he
needed was the chance.

”BYU was a chance for me to
get my feet wet,” said Walker. ”I
patiently waited for a chance to
play. I gave them my answer.”

It has taken some time for
Walker to be where he is today.
As a senior in high school, he
rushed for 1,079 yards and
scored 17 touchdowns. He was
named AAA Player of the Year
and was named to the ”Big 33,”
where 33 of the best football

_ players in the state come together.

He was named to the Street
and Smith's High School All-
America team as well as All-
WPIAL, All-State, All-South and
All—Conference. He was one of
The Pittsburgh Press’ ”Finest 44"
and one of the Post—Cazette’s

Soccer team splits 1

weekend

By Vince Carey
Staff Writer

The Pitt soccer team split two
games this past weekend at the
California University tournament.

On Saturday, the Panthers lost

3-2 to Tiffin University, but on ,

Sunday, they topped California,
”Overall, the team looked
good,” said Pitt head coach Joe
Luxbacher. ”We were inconsis-
tent at times; it is something we
are going to have to work on.”

In Saturday's game, the Pan-
thers took 3241 lead into the last

10 minutes of the game only to.

scored by Mike Grimes and Dave

Luxbacher expressed disap-
pointment with the loss to a team
that he felt could have been
beaten.

”It:was a tough loss,” said Lux-
bacher. ”Our defense didn't do
the job at the end of the game.
We really should have won the
game.” '

On Sunday, the Panthers
recorded their first shutout of the
season by blanking a tough
California team, 3-0. Goals were
scored by Grimes, Moss and
Blatz. -

tive,” said Luxbacher. ”The team

Bradshaw steps in where

By Beth Froelich

Assistant Sports Editor

Pitt men's swimming will be
changing hands,‘ as Aquatic
Director Dick Bradshaw takes
over former head swimming
coach Fred Lewis’ position this
fall-

Lewis, who coached the
Panthers since 1979, and led
the team to four consecutive
Big East Championships,
resigned last spring for reasons

Lewis’ contract was not
renewed. by mutual agree-
ment. The reason for his
departure is between Fred
Lewis and the university, and
it shall remain confidential.”

Bradshaw, who will take
over the vacated position, is
no stranger to the, Pitt swim-
ming program.

Bradshaw’s career at Pitt
started in 1969 when he be-
came the assistant men's
coach. In 1971, he became

the head coachand remained’

at that position until 1981
when he was offereda full-

”When I quit coachingiin
1981, I felt. I would coach
again, but I didn't think it
would be here,” said Brad-
shaw. ”I wanted a move.”

Bradshaw, after turning the
position down’ three times
over the summer, finally ac-
cepted. .

’’I’m excited about taking

the position,” said Bradshaw. I

”I,am delighted with the new

setup. The atmosphere around —

Walker——

Fabulous 22.

Then trouble struck.

Walker took the Scholastic Ap-
titude Test and received a 650,
slightly below the required 700
needed to be allowed to compete
in Division I sports. After taking
the test for a second time, his
score jumped to 1,000.

Educational Testing Services
”flagged” his second score be-
cause such a jump is pretty rare.
He was declared ineligible for his
freshman year.

But now he's back and feels the
best of Adam Walker is yet to
come. .

’’I can still do a little better.
That run where I lost my balance
and twisted my ankle cutting
back should have been a touch-
down,” said Walker.

Walker refers to a 51-yard run
that was called back due to
penalties committed by both
sides. He lost his footing and was

eventually tracked down by the
Wolfpack. After the penalties, he
was awarded a 132-yard run. The
run was significant because it dis-
played Walker's explosive quick-
ness and speed.

”Adam will be better, and
when he gets more playing time,
he'll be fine,” said head coach
Mike Gottfried.

Walker doesn't credit himself
for his fine performance in the
game, but gives credit to the men
in the trenches.

”The line blocking was fantas-
tic. A runner is only as good as
his linemen, and they were
great.”

Walker, a finance economics
major, has one sports idol to
whom he draws a similar com-
parison.

’’I look up to Eric Dickerson [of
the Los Angeles Rams],” he said.
”He’s tall, 6-foot-3, same height
as me, and our style is similar.”

Dickerson or not, Pitt may ex-
pect big things to happen with
Walker in the future. Only time
and the coach will tell.

kind of approach. The main em-

team surprised everyone but

together. This not only saves the
budget money but brings the
team, as a whole, closer together
as a unit.” .

Bradshaw will remain the coor-
dinator of basic instruction and
the head of the Aquatic Club at
Pitt.

Bradshaw is excited to take
over the program but feels that it
is hard for a new coach to come
in and take over where another
coach left off, basically because
a new coach does not know the
range of hisathletes’ abilities.

Bradshaw feels that although
his coaching techniques and
Lewis’ differ, their training tech-
niques are fairly similar, and this
will make the adjustment easier

setting and positive feedback.”

”At the same time,” continued
Bradshaw, ”our coaching styles
—— that is, what we do in practice
— is essentially the same. This
stands to reason since I coached
Fred when he was a swimmer.”

Head women's swimming
coach David Bellowich and div-
ing coach Julian Krug both hold
high opinions of Bradshaw and
are looking forward to working
with him in the future.

”Bradshaw is a great motivator
and a real people person,” said
Bellowich. ”Coach Lewis did a
commendable job in the past,
and I don't think Bradshaw will
have any trouble picking up the
ball and running with it.”

responded well in this game. Our
defense really shut them down-
California already had two wins
this season, so they weren't a bad
team. It felt good to win.”

On the dark side this weekend,
Pitt starter Sam Lanza broke his
jaw during Saturday's game. He
may be lost for the season.

Pitt will take its 2-1 record on

the road again this week. Wed-
nesday, they play at St. Francis
University.

”St. Francis is a vastly im-
proved team this year,” said Lux-
bacher. ”They beat a tough
Geneva team last week, so we'll
have to be ready.”

”They play on natural turf,
which will be a change for us.
We'll have to work on a few
things this week in practice.
Hopefully, we'll be ready for
them.” ,
