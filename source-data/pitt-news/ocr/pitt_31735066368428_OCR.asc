Students in need of financial
aid for next fall should begin
now to apply for the thousands
of scholarships being offered by
private foundations, trade and
civic groups and other sources.

There are over 25,000 different
scholarships available, accord-
ing to the director of the Scholar-
ship Bank. Scholarships are
available from tax exempt foun-
dations that are required by law
to make a certain amount of
financial" aid available each year
in order to maintain their tax
exempt status.

The Scholarship Bank
matches students with available
aid and -sends the student a print-
out of the private financial aid
sources that appear to be the
most promising for the individ-
ual student. Each student may
receive a list of up to 50 sources '
of aid.

Most scholarships have a
value of approximately $1,000,
and many are renewed annually.
Academic major, occupational
goal, geographic preference, mil- V
itary service of the student or his
parent, employer, union mem-
bership, academic standing and
ethnic heritage can all determine
eligibility for aid.

Students who want to receive a
print-out should send a stamped,
business size self-addressed enve-
lope to: The Scholarship Bank,
10100 Santa Monica Blvd. #750,
Los Angeles, CA 90067. A self-
description questionnaire will be
sent to the student, and the appli-
cant can then receive the person-
alized scholarship information.

By PEGGY FERRI

‘Various community, social and

‘ religious groups have launched an

intensive program for non-violent

resistance in Pittsburgh coordinated

in part by Pitt Englsh professor
Liane Norman.

The program, called the River
City Campaign, plans to meet and
continue to meet every Wednesday
at noon in front of either the Rock-
well headquarters in the U.S. Steel
building or the Westinghouse build-
ing to make its presence and disap-
proval of the arms race known.

Since its beginning, the program
has been involved in a number of
activities — including handing out
leaflets, but in the future there will
be limited and separate opportuni-
ties for intensified resistance and
civil disobedience. The corporations
and police will be notified of such
demonstrations in advance.

“The campaign goes one step
beyond standard resistance,” Nor-
man said. "The idea of the program
is to resist the arms race through
persistant and non-violent means.”

As a professor, Norman said that
she feels the responsibility to make a
peaceful world for her students as
well as her children.

“My involvement rests on a per-
sonal as well as professional respon-
sibility to end the arms race,” she
said. She added that if she had been
a\ rofessor in Germany during the
wa years, she would have felt a need
to‘ speak out the same way she does
now.

The reason that 1983 is considered
by Pittsburgh peace groups to be a
critical year is that it is the year of the
first strike, according to program

_‘._-xi‘

By December, strategic weapons
planners intend to have deployed
cruise missiles in Europe. The mis-
siles are small and can be launched
from the ground, sea or air. There-
fore, they cannot be verified by any
existing means. This, the literature
says, will make arms negotiations
difficult and complex.

The concentration of concern,
however, revolves around U.S.
plans to build a number of other
weapons that are not to be used for
deterrence but for a first strike. Wea-
pons characteristic of first strike
weapons, these groups argue, make
it likely that the U.S.S.R. will adopt
a launch-on-warning system,
increasing the danger of an acciden-
tal nuclear war.

Many groups have expressed an
interest in joining the campaign,
including a group of history gradu-
ate students from Carnegie-Mellon
University.

Molly Rush, who has been
involved in working for similar
peace campaigns, said that she is

‘pleased to see students again becom-

ing involved in an issue of obvious
importance. Several colleges and
universities have also asked Rush to
speak.

She said that students from
Duquesne University have con-
tacted her about the campaign, but
she added that she hopes fraternities
and sororities might also become
more involved.

Rush is still out on bond pending
appeal for her involvement in King
of Prussia, Pa. where she and a few
others entered a General Electric
plant and damaged several missile
nose cones.

“Peace work is by ‘its very nature
frustrating,” Rush admitted. “Still, I

future. My faith goes beyond just
looking at the signs of the times,” she
explained, adding that her faith was

- more religious.

Rush said that it was out of a sense
of urgency that she and others like
Norman have joined together.

Pittsburgh, according to the cam-
paign literature, has been chosen
because it is a river city considered to
be as vulnerable as the river city of

Last-Minute
Requests
Considered
By RON BARBER

meeting of the term last night to~dis-
cuss emergency budget requests

, from student organizations. The

committee will begin next week to
consider budget requests for the
next school year.

In last night’s meeting, the com-

mittee heard a new request for funds

for the Israel Week on campus
event. This program—a week of lec-
tures, films and concerts—will be
presented by Pitt’s Masada organi-
zation in cooperation with several
community and state Jewish groups.
Last week, the Student Government
Board followed an Allocations
Committee recommendation to
deny funding for some of the week’s
religious and social programs.
Masada director Zachary Gray-
son said that his group had “restruc-
tured” those programs to separate
their cultural aspects from their reli-
gious and social aspects. The com-
mittee accepted the revised request
to fund only the cultural programs.
Allocations Committee chairman
James Shelton said that, although
this was the last formal meeting of
his group to hear emergency
requests this term, the deadline for
those_requests is not until Friday.
Any others that are received

between now and the deadline will

be handled by telephone.

Shelton said that preparations for
the upcoming budgetideliberations
have already begun and added that
he hopes that this process will run
smoothly and eff1ciently..“The most
important thing for me is effi-
ciency,” he explained. Preparations
included a series of sessions to famil-
iarize ‘committee members with stu-
dent government funding policies.

The Allocations Committee
makes decisions each year involving

“about a quarter of .a million dol-~

lars” in student activities fees,

according to Shelton, and although.

that money is actually handled by
the Office of Student Affairs, he said
the ‘Allocations Committee has
“essentially a free hand in making
decisions.”

The Greeks have Greek Week
and various other charity and
social functions. Engineers have
their week, too, with many
engineering-focused activities.
Even the pharmacy school has a_
week dedicated to its field.

Yet there is really no single
event that congregates Pitt’s
groups and organizations better
than the annual Hand-in-Hand
Festival.

“The Hand-in-Hand Festival
is one of the largest single-day
events at the university,” coordi-
nator Mark Drnach said.

Over 40 student organizations,
along with 800 student volun-
teers, devote the last Saturday in
March to a special purpose — to
better understand and helpthe
handicapped child. Approxi-
mately 400 of Pittsburgh’s sur-
rounding areas’ handicapped
children, will participate in this
year’s festival scheduled for

“Fraternities, sororities,
honoraries, nurses and other
groups get involved in the festi-
val each year," Drnach said. “All
in all, we have about 1,500 volun-
teers for the day. Everyone is
enthusiastic to aid in any way he
can."

Why would organizations
choose a day to benefit handi-
capped children above" many
other student events? According
to Drnach, one of the reasons lies
in the duration of the
commitment.

“Many charity fund raisers
may take weeks to organize and
implement,” Drnach explained.
“The Hand-in-Hand Festival
offers a one-day opportunity to
benefit the Pittsburgh commun-
ity, as well as learn about the
exceptional childs’ capabilities.”

Groups may spend from 12 to
48 hours organizing a booth or a
stage act, Drnach said. Some of

Cheating at Pitt is not on an
upswing, and in the last academic
year, only 20 cases of student cheat-
ing were brought before the Aca-
demic Integrity Board.

According to Dr. Ray Steele,
Assistant Provost, the charges that
were brought against the students
included “plagerism, submission of
the work of another student, fraudu-
lent or misrepresented research
sources, cheating on exams and
inappropriate behavior in a clinical
setting."

Also brought before the board
last year were 13 charges against
faculty members by students,which
included, according to Steele, “inac-
curate and inappropriate grading

..practices, failure to describe the

nature and requirements of the
course at the beginning of the term,
inaccurate and inappropriate advis-
ing, misrepresenting the level of a
course, and prejudicial behavior.”

Under the terms of the University
of Pittsburgh Academic Integrity
Guidelines—which were created in
1976 by students, faculty and admin-
istration at Pitt for the purpose of
providing a fair and reasonable
means for maintaining integrity
between students and faculty at the

v university—25 of the 33_ cases were

resolved. Only seven of the cases,
according to Steele, were unable to
be resolved without schoolintegrity

board action, and only one of the '

-seven was appealed beyond the

school in which the charge was

_ brought for university review.

Each of the 20 schools has its own
Academic Integrity Board, which

"includes faculty members, admini-

stration and students. When a pro-

_blem exists between a student and a

Cheating At Pitt, Not A Major Problem

resolved, either can submit the pro-
blem to the board. In the case of a
student being caught cheating by an
instructor, for example, he or she
can work the problem out with the
instructor, and if a solution cannot
be reached there, the instructor can
turn it over to the board.

If a student, on the other hand,

has a complaint against the instuctor
and it cannot be resolved between
them, the same option is open.

If a resolution is not reached
through the board, the next step is
the University Review Board, which
Steele said few conflicts ever reach.
Most problems, according to Steele,
are in fact resolved informally by the
student and the instructor, and he
recommends that students and

. .faculty attempt to settle disputes at

this level.

Steele said that when asked to rate
the guidelines as a means of conflict
resolution on a scale from one to five
(unsuccessful to very successful), the
mean response from the 20 schools
was four—eight responded with a
five ranking and four more with a
four. No school, Steele said,

' responded with a dissatisfied or
“unsuccessful” ranking or comment.

Tom Campbell of the Student
Judicial Board said that there have

been no majorproblems with cheat- A

ing in the recent past and attributed
this to the fact that “students are

more aware of, the importance .;of V

succeeding without cheating.”

Echoing this opinion, Steele said -

that students are more competitive
these days and less likely to under-
mine their own academic position by
aiding or‘ otherwise tolerating
cheaters. ’

Some members of the faculty are,
however, concerned with cheating in
their classrooms and maintain pre-
vention methods that range from

A simple to dramatic.

Frank Giarratani of the econom-
ics department admits to making
multiple versions ofthe same exam,
as many instructors do, so that a
student attempting to copyanoth-
er’s answers from a multiple choice
will end up with all the wrong
answers.

Most instructors, particularly
those with large classes, place moni-
tors in the classroom during exami-
nations, and many use different

exams with different colored paper. _
_Dr. Richard Scaglion of the _

anthropology department, who has
an unusually large number of stu-
dents to deal ‘with in the introduc-
tory class, said,“The possibilities for
cheating are huge in a class this size,
so I try to be as equally inventive as
the student.”

One of Scaglion’s methods is to
carefully monitor who enters the
class during exams with an I.D.
check.‘ Another is to plant spies and
monitors. ‘

“I have no particular system, and
I’m always changing the things I do,

I -—-Paige 3

,

but one of my favorites is a plant
that I place in my class," said Sca-
glion “During the exam, I go over
and accuse him or her of cheating,
then rip their paper up. This always
scares everyone too much to think
about cheating themselves.”

Scaglion said that he would do . I
everything in his power to prevent.

cheating in his class, and that he tries

The Hand-in-Hand Festival,
which is under the auspices ofthe
Office of Residence Life (ORL),
does not just happen — it takes
months and weeks of prep-
aration.

“Lisa (Shumaker) and I
started working on last year’s fes-
tival in March,” Drnach said,
“The staff began working early in
September. It is hard to realize

Fesﬁvaleach yean

Student volunteers ar a necessary pair‘ of th Hand-i

  Lend   A

how much work it takes to
organize the festival.”

“We are better organized this
year than we ever have been,"
Drnach said. “I think we have
learned a lot from past year’s fes-
tivals. We’re doing things a lot
differently, a lot more efficiently,
this year."

The Hand-in-Hand Festival
staff numbers over 110. Each
staff member occupies the role of
committee chair, committee
member or facilitator. The festi-
val also‘ has budget managers,
secretaries, medical directors
and photographers to lessen the
load of work.

Currently, the festival lists
nine committees in its frame-

    

Helping Hand At Festival  

work. The committees include:
activities, booths, computer,
decorations, public relations,
volunteers, institutions and
food, Each committee has a spe-
cific function, but several com-
mittees overlap in their
functions.

“Volunteer and public rela-
tions are what we call ‘mobile
committees,’ " Drnach
explained. “These committees
will help other ‘committees along
with their duties.”

A separate branch of the
Hand-in-Hand. Festival's staff
are the facilitators. The facilita-
tor’s purpose is to attend to the
physically and mentally handi-
capped children. A festival facil-
itator is required to attend six
training sessions to further his
education on exceptional child-
ren, Drnach said.

“A facilitator must be certified
in cardio-pulmonary resusita-
tion (CPR), have knowledge of
Basic sign language, know how
to handle and feed the children
and be able to recognize and
treatepileptic seizures,” Drnach
explained. “All the training
needed can be acquired in the
educational sessions.”

But what makes the festival so

Th:Pitt News, Wednesday February .16, 1983

By PATTI VISHNESKY

Poland’s reaction to the lifting of
martial law has been positive,
according "to Pitt sociology profes-
sor Zdenek Suda.-

Suda, who has worked with Pol-
ish social scientists for the past 12
years, held an intormal discussion
yesterday in the English department

A on his impressions of Poland after

the suspension of martial law.
Suda spoke of the experiences of
people he associated with in Poland.
His contacts consist mainly of social
scientists and journalists, and none
are members _of_ the Worker’s Party.

  
 

The rightist movement began with
the working class, who saw the elim-
ination of the intellectuals in power
as a way to save socialism in Poland.
The workers see the party intellectu-
als as the evil of the present regime
because they (the intellectuals) are
considered the bourgeoisie of
Poland’s class structure.

When martial law was instated,
Suda felt the lifestyle of intellectuals
in Poland had been damaged
because they had lost their freedom
of governmentalinquiry, the reason
being that the information concern-
ing the elifnination of many science

and government jobs was withheld. ,

This judgement, however, turned
out to be superficial on the part of
the liberals. Actually, it was only the
jobs of the top government officials
that were lost.

Faculty Harassmen

By ANN O'CONNOR

Faculty harassment has been a
chief concern with the Senate Com-
mittee on Tenure and Academic
Freedom.‘ :

The problem was recently pre-
sented at a Faculty Assembly meet-
ing, and as a result, it was brought to
the attention of the senate.

Barbara Shore, co-chairman of
the senate subcommittee, ‘said
faculty harassment is when faculty

Suda has not spoken with any of
the workers in Poland, but during
his visits, he has viewed the impact
that the workers have had on his
intellectual associates. He feels the
rightist movement has given them a
tremendous amount of stimulation
by increasing their chances of free-
dom from the present regime.

Poland’s fight for _
according to Suda, will be a tight-
rope walk.

;‘The chances of intellectual free-
dom will depend on how careful the
intellectuals are,” Suda said. “They
are now facing their own troops, as
opposed‘ to the takeovers in 1956
and 1968, when Hungary and Cze-
choslovakia took over.” ‘

This internal takeover is another
reason why Suda believes the Com-
munist Party in Poland hasn’t been
shaken as badly as in ’56 and ’68.

As for the political rallying in

. Poland, Suda feels the efforts have
improved over the past 20 years.
Previously, the Polish have been
seen as romantics. Now, however,
they have the potential of preserving
a greater amount uf freedom, and
the Polish Communist Party may

even break away from the confor-

mists in Poland.

Suda travelled regularly to
Poland, except during the enforce-
ment of martial law. During his last
visit, he -saw the situation as
improved from 1981, for the area in
which the regime was intruding was
lessening.

Although he cannot make predic-
tions for Poland as a nation, he
believes the movement was started
by the working class and fought by
the intellectual class. There were no
victories and no defeats—it was a
tie. A —

members are subject to unfair eva-
luations that later lead to decisions
to the detriment of the faculty
member. In the case of faculty who
have already acquired tenure, the
problems occur in negative evalua-
tions by deans and department
heads that could prevent salary
increases or lead to the assignment
of exclusively lower level courses.
Shore said that such actions
hamper faculty performance in the
classroom and that the senate’s
objective is to “resolve the interfer-
ence caused by faculty harassment.”

member chooses to share the infor-

mation, then he is allowed to exer-

cise that option. Shore said,
however, that the senate committee
does not publicize the results.
Shore said that, although there
are only about 10 complaints a year,
the senate thought the problem war-

ranted a sanction for its s’ubcommit- .

tee to expand-its responsibilities and
investigate faculty complaints. In
the past, there has been no mecha-
nism to ,deal with faculty harass-
ment, therefore the Senate Council
support became a necessity. '

Hiroshima. Pittsburgh is also the
third largest corporate headquarters
in the U.S. ’ Two corporations-
Rockwell International and
Westinghouse—have major defense
contracts for first strike weapons.

Rockwell, groups explain, makes all‘

the plutonium triggers for all the H-
bombs manufactured. It is also the
prime contractor for the MX-
missile. Westinghouse makes,
among others, guidance systems for
the Tomahawk cruise missile.

The campaign began officially on
Feb. 2 and since then Westinghouse"
could not be reached for comment
on the leafletting and peaceful dem-
onstrating that have gone on outside
of its headquarters. Rockwell Inter-
national, however, declined to com-
ment on any of the groups activities.

According to Norman, the public
response to groups who stand in
front of the two corporations has
been “impressive.”_

Norman explained that there are
three separate phases of opposition
to the arms race: lobby, protest and
resist.

Lobbying includes expressing
opinions in writing and contacting
government representatives and let-
ting them know what their constitu-
ents think, according to Norman.

Protest is the stage in which most
Americans are now—letting their
disapproval be known. —

She explained that resistance, in
which a growing number of people
are becoming involved, involves an
active non-cooperation that chal-
lenges the legitimacy of a policy.

Norman said that she would like
to see even more people involved
and the program expand.

In response to those who criticize
such actions as having little impact,
Norman used the example of a
movement started by women in Eng-
land to demonstrate their dissatis-
faction with the cruise missiles.
Those concerned expected a few
thousand women, but the crowd
grew to about 30,000 women-
enough to encircle the entire nine-
mile base. Such demonstrations,
Norman said, are just as important
for those who participate as those
who do not.

Church groups are also becoming
involved in the Pittsburgh cam-
paign, according to Rush. -

“They haven’t gotten this involved
for a while," Rush said. “Church
groups across the spectrum have
been looking deeper into the impli-
cations of the arms race and have
been realizing public concern.”

Norman agreed and added that
she would also like to see increased
tax resistance as a response to the
arms race.

The freeze movement has conser-
vative proposals, according to Nor-
man. She added that she also agrees
with statements made recently by
Pitt political science professor
Richard Cottam at a Pitt Arms Race
Study Group .meeting.He told the
group that the U.S. should explore
the different proposals being offered

. by Yuri Andropov before dismissing

them so quickly.

“The freeze movement has opened _

the issue,” Norman said, “but more
can be done. We also need to learn to
resolve problems by using different
means than the U.S. has used in the
past.”

  Positively
  Mystifying

Following the unveiling of Governor Richard

7 Thornburgh’s budget proposal—which included a

scant 1.9 percent increase in appropriations for Pitt-
tuitiori increases and budget cuts are again the subject
of many discussions at Pitt. At a recent Faculty
Assembly meeting, Professor Richard Cottam made a
remark that, under these circumstances, should be
echoed across campus.

Professor Cottam—perhaps better known for his
insights into international affairs than his expertise on
university issues—commented that, in facing tough
economic times, the university must distinguish
between programs that are central to the mission of

‘ Pitt and those begun during better days of growth in

higher education.

The Pitt News has previously examined the distinc-
tion between research and teaching as parts of the
central role of universities and has suggested thatboth
areas shareequal status as being “central” to the mis-
sion of Pitt.

The distinction Cottam makes is a different one,
which suggests that in deciding what to cut from the
university budget, some programs (including research
and teaching) maybe entitled to more protection from
the fiscal knife than others. It may be possible, along
this line of thinking, to spell out where certain pro-
grams fit——assigning values to the centrality of areas
like geography, computer science or philosophy. To
begin making that sort of evaluation now, however,
would be to ignore a part of Pitt’s mission which has
long been regarded as among the most important—'
meeting the educational and-‘financial needs of the
tri-state community. '

If that goal can be regarded as a crucial one for Pitt,
then our administration’s reactionito the Thornburgh
budget is positively mystifying. This university was
granted a funding increase which, while lower than the
inﬂation rate for last year, was much closer to parallel-
ing inﬂation than the amount requested by Pitt. In
response to that funding gap, the university promptly
announced that Pitt’s tuition would have to rise. This
can mean nothing except that Pitt’s budget is growing
faster than inflation.

In regards to all that, Pitt should remember that its
main goal as an institution is to teach and to provide
students with the necessary tools for a higher
education.

Letters To The Editor

Dear Editor:

Recently, letters have appeared in
The Pitt News making unfair and
unjustified accusations at the state
of Israel. Most recently, William J.
Coury, on Feb. 9, made statements
that need to be corrected.

Mr. Coury claims that peace will -

never come to the Middle East “as
long as Israel continues to do what-
ever it wants without regard to its
neighbor-. or allies...” What Israel

wants, rather, is to survive and what‘
Israel seeks is peace. Israel will con-. 
tinue to do whatever is necessary ’
' without regard -to its neighborsor ‘.
allies in..the search for survival and 

peace. »

It is true that ‘Israel has a strong»-
' army, but it has always been sur-
-rounded by combined Arab. armies

far outweighing her n_ii_merica1 and
material strength. Should Israel not
have as strong an army as she has,

she would be in direct threat of
annihilation. Coury suggests that
the “massacre” in Lebanon was not
Israel’s first. This is a blatant misre-
presentation of the facts. Three
hundred Moslem men, women and

children were mercilessly slaugh-
tered by Christian forces. To blame "

the Jews, with no condemnation at
all of those who perpetrated this

' massacre, reeks of Jew hatred. This

was one more horrible massacre in a
chain of massacres which have
become commonplace in Lebanon
since the arrival of the PLO. Com-
paring it to the systematic slaughter
of Jewish civilians by’the forces of
Nazi Germany isuagross distortion.

Teaching At Pitt

Dear Editor:

The recent Pitt News article on
teaching and research (“Forum,”
Feb. ll, I983) contained some fine
statements on the mission of a
research university. But it also con-
tained some statements that are
demonstrably false and in need of

implying strongly that the better a
researcher a professor is, the better a
teacher he is likely to be. (“The best

‘researchers are very often the most

effective teachers,” and “The people
who do research are more effective
in [the] c1assrom.”) It is ironic that a
competent researcher such as Dr.
Pasculle would make such dogmatic
statements without checking .the

Unfair Accusations

continue to demand that the “Zion-
ist entity” give them whatever they
desire with no cost to themselves. No
sane government is willing to com-
mit national suicide and cut its land
in two. The main problem in that
part of the Middle East is the refusal
of the Arab states, with the excep-
tion of Egypt, to recognize the legal
existence of the State of Israel in any
part of the worldSaudi Arabia, that
most moderate of feudal kingdoms,
last year called for a holy war against
the Jews. And theseare the people
Israel is supposed to submit to?
Coury claims that West Bank
Palestinians have no rights. This ‘is
another in a series of falsehoods.

Israel has in reality granted the
inhabitants more rights than they

‘had previously. Today Arabs in

" Israel have freedom of religion, free-

dom of speech and press, freedom of
assembly and freedom of move-
ment. Arab women now have the
fundamental right to vote, which
was denied them under Jordanian
law and is still denied in most Arab
countries. Would (‘oury rather have
them ‘return to the tyranny of 
previous “rulers” of the land?

Egypt and Israel are the only two
countries in the Middle East which
have moved in any way towards
peace. Let the United States pres-
sure all concerned parties to sit
down at the negotiating_table. Con-
cessions are made at that time, not
before. The problem of the Middle
East is Arab unwillingness to recog-
nize in any way the right of the Jew-
ish people to a state.

Teaching: Living Up To The Promise

continued from page eig/It

Quite a few investigators have indeed
compared students’ evaluations of teaching
effectiveness at colleges and universities with

-the research productivity of the faculty

members. The data show resoundingly that
“publishing and effective teaching do not go
hand in hand. Neither do they ordinarily
conflict. They simply are not related to each
other in any apparent way, even at the
extremes._ Competency in research and pub-
lishing signifies nothing, one way or
another, about competency in teaching."
(The quote is from Voeks, V.W., Journal of
Higher Education, 33, 1962.) Several other
studies, such as Aleamoni and Yimer, Jour-
nal of Educational Psychology, 1973; Harry
and Goldner, Sociology of Education, 1972;
and Plant and Sawrey, The Clinical Psy-
chologist, l970, come to the
conclusion. O -—

So let’s put that one to bed once and for
all. The fact that a professor does research
does not make him a better teacher. And the
reason is simply that teaching and research
involve what are to a great extent different
sets of skills. Being good at one cannot logi-
cally be expected to make a person good at
the other. — I - '

* As Dr. Alan Fisher recognized in The Pitt
News article, many professors “do not have
the ability or dedication for both,” and the
researcher who cannot teach well should not
be inflicted upon students, or, in Dr. Fisher’s
words, “forced into the classroom.” It is
these faculty members who are competent
researchers but poor teachers—and there

same

will inevitably be some~—who lead students
to jump to the opposite conclusion from that
of Dr. Pasculle: that researchers are most
likely to be the worst teachers. This is, of
course, equally wrong.

‘ In a traditional and overworked attempt
to show a connection between doing
research and teaching well, Dr. Fisher and
FAS dean Jerome “Rosenberg in the same
article invoke the old “excitement of discov-
ery” argument: that, in Dr. Fisher’s words,
“the better [the] researcher...the more excit-
ing [his] classes,” or according to Dean
Rosenberg, the active researcher “can...con-
vey to students the enthusiasm that comes
with the discovery process.” _

Well, maybe he can and maybe he can't.
Who is to say that someone who has felt an
emotion is automatically able to be articu-
late about it? Who is to say that a teacher
can’t be just as enthusiastic about knowledge
he has not personally discovered? And what
fraction of the knowledge in any given
course can possibly have been discoveredby
even the most productive researcher-teacher
anyway?

What, then, can be said about the health-
ful relationship between research and teach-
ing in a ‘university? Dean Rosenberg was
much closer to the mark when he said, “It is
to the benefit of the student to be at a univer-
sity where the research is noted.” In my own
opinion, this is potentially, although not
universally, true. But the potential benefit is
not to be found in “better teachers.” It is
more complex than that. There is indisputa-
bly more intellectual ferment going on in a

research university than in, for example, a
community college. Respectfor knowledge

and inquiry is therefore likely to rub off on

students to a greater extent at the research 4

university,‘where new knowledge is actively
‘being pursued. But the rubbing-off doesn’t
occur because the same people who are
doing the research are telling_their students
about it, whether effectively or clumsily.

It occurs because the students happen to
be right on the spot in which intellectual
history is being made. The excitement of
new knowledge is transmitted to them, not
by a professor running from the laboratory
to the classroom with “Eureka!" on his lips,
but by the best teachers‘—researchers or
not—getting excited by what they read and
hear from their colleagues about the latest
thinking in the‘ field and their having the
ability to transmit that excitement to their
students. (And until a better one comes
along, this will do as a definition of good
college teaching.)

It is the teaching talent of the faculty,
then, not the research talent—the transmit-
ters, not the sources of knowledge-—that
enrichesgthe students’ education. And the
teacher at a research university happens to
have a greater fund of “hot knowledge” at
his fingertips to transmit.

When both of these talents residein the
same person, we have the ideal, all-around
university professor: teacher and scholar.
When they don’t, and this is more often the
case, what do we do to ensure that our stu-
dents get the best teaching, a goal that is
certainly shared by Drs. Fisher, Pasculle and

Rosenberg?

First, our departments and schools should
try to hire faculty that are as close‘ to the
ideal teacher-scholar combination as possi-

ble. This, most of them already do. But when
cirsumstances dictate the hiring of an excep-
tionally strong researcher, they must imme-
diately abandon the fiction that his teaching
will take care of itself.

The second thing that should be done,
then, is evaluation. Every faculty member's
teaching can and should be evaluated regu-
larly‘by both his students and his colleagues.
Whenever such evaluations point to defi-
ciencies, the faculty member should be
strongly encouraged by his department or
school administration to work on them,
whether alone, with colleagues or with the
help of the Office of Faculty Development. I

have seen innumerable faculty members—'

strong and weak researchers alike——-improve
their teaching by working away at their
deficiencies.

Third, it must be recognized throughout
the university that good teaching is not so
much a product of inborn talent as it is of
work and time. Whether or not a faculty
member is hired primarily for his research

talent is really of secondary Importance.

What most determineshis teaching effec-
tiveness is how much work and time he puts
into it. If each and every faculty member is
given an unambiguous message by his chair-
man or clean that he is expected to devote as
much time to his teaching as is necessary to
maintain a high degree of effectiveness,
research or no research, only then will our
university live up to its promise of providing
a truly superior education—one that cannot
indeed by matched by a non-research
institution.

The Cafeteria To

7-11  

A college student can expect to
grapple with a host of difficulties
between the ages of 17 and 21, but
probably the most unexpected and
least understood of those problems
is malnutrition.

While there have been no reports
of an outbreak of scurvy or rickets
on the nation's campuses these
days and scarcely a student has
been spotted with beriberi, a large
number of students are simply‘ not
eating nutritious foods.

Without the proper diet, people
within that age group can seriously
jeopardize not only their perfor-
mance in the classroom, but their
physical and mental development as
well.

I The average student, particularly
the dormitory—dweller with a school
cafeteria meal—plan, is at the mercy
of a system that will fill him up and

bog him down with sugar, carbohy-

drates, harmful chemicals and
polyunsaturated fats.

The bill of fare on many institu-
tions’ daily menus reads like a cata-
logue of everything that should be
consumed with caution or modera-
tion, or that should not be con-
sumed at all.

Gravies, puddings, pancakes,
greasy fried meats, mashed pota-
toes, refined rice, white refined
breads and gooey desserts can be
attractive enough to people reared
on them, but their nutritional value
lies far below what nutrition experts
regard as wholesome.

To compound the problem, most
campus towns are bastions of fast-
food establishments that cater to
the ill-informed palates and restless
stomachs of people who snack for
entertainment and eat on the run.

With only these two choices at
their disposal—the low-grade
starches and carbohydrates of the
cafeteria or the greasy junk on the
streets—many students suffer from
deficiencies that are harmful, unnec-
essary and sometimes permanently
damaging.

Stress, obesity, acne, bad teeth,
stomach trouble, hypertension and
heart disease all sound like prob-
lems that take their toll on the
middle-aged, but many young peo-
ple are experiencing the same con-
ditions, and according to experts
like Jim Winer, author of “The Basic
Nutrition Handbook,” the source of
these problems is poor nutrition.

“The expedient usage of excess
technology has caused a great
decline in food quality which is daily
becoming more serious,” Winer
said. “Few people eat a balanced
diet.

“Generally, we confine ourselves
to a top-heavy meat protein diet,
rounded out with sugary boxed
cereals, desserts, french fries and
synthetic foods and colas. Devital-
ized foods, such as white bread and
overcooked vegetables, lacking nat-
ural fiber, cause digestive and intes-
tinal problems, and set the stage for
more serious illness.”

Since bread is an important staple
in student diet—one that is difficult
to avoid when it is offered in so many
ways and in such abundance on-

and off-cam ,us—students should
_ be awarﬁctly what thevre set.

ting (an not getting) while they're
eating their sandwiches, pizzas and
toast.

The most common and popular
bread is of the white, “enriched” var-
iety, which means that the impor-

tant nutrients, the bran and the
wheat germ, have been removed by
manufacturers, leaving only the
white, wotthlgss

      

5‘:-

Removal of the bran and wheat
germ facilitate better storage of the
ﬂour (since insects will only eat the
nutritional portions), and the consu-
mer is denied the -valuable amounts
of phosphorous, manganese,
copper, sulphur, iodine, ﬂuorine and
other important elements contained
in those ingredients.

The process of enriching the
bread, after over 26 essential ele-
ments are removed from the ﬂour,
according to Dr. David Reuben,
means that about one-sixth of a cent
worth of cheap, synthetic vitamins
are added to the product before
marketing.

In addition to those, a number of
chemicals are introduced to the
bread to preserve its freshness and
to make it ﬂuffier and more
attractive.

One of those chemicals is calcium
sulfate, more commonly known as
plaster of Paris, which is added to
make the dough more easily
handled in manufacturing, and
another is propylene glycol, which
prevents discoloration in the bread,
but is better known as anti-freeze.

ln tests, it caused little harm in
animals, except making them highly
depressed, according to Reuben,
the author of “Everything You
Always Wanted to Know About

pressure of school combined with
the absence of regular eating habits

is hard on the body.

Winer recommends a reliance on
the freshness of natural, rather than
canned or otherwise processed,
foods. This presents a problem to
many students, who rely on the pro-
ducts in the school cafeteria. How-
ever, many of the foods offered
there, if selected carefully, are sour-

ces of valuable nutrition.

For example, any fresh fruits or ‘

vegetables, particularly from the
salad bar, should be consumed in
larger quantities than the desserts,
pasta and fried dishes. The fiber in
these natural products will aid in
digestion in addition to providing
valuable vitamins and minerals (and
a lot less calories).

If whole wheat bread is offered, it
should be selected over the sweet,
ﬂuffy white breads and macaroni
and noodle dishes.

Products that contain whole
grains are less likely to be eaten
quickly. Since they require more
chewing, they will absorb water in
the stomach, inducing a sense of
fullness and causing the eater to
consume less food while providing
the body with vitamins and

’ minerals. I

Nutrition”

‘The average student, particularly the

dormitory-dweller with a school cafete-

ria meal-plan, is at the mercy of a system

that fills him and bogs him down with

sugar, carbohydrates, harmful

chemicals....’

Considering that much of the stu-
dent diet consists of ﬂour products
like pasta, cake, biscuits, pastries,
donuts and crackers, and that their
flour is stripped of its nutrients in the
same way that bread ﬂour is, much
of the food being consumed by the
average student is empty, fattening
calories.

Another pitfall for students—one
that is contained in nearly every pro-
cessed food on the market-—is
refined white sugar. The Federal
Trade Commission has declared
that sugar is not really good for any-

thing except ﬂavoring, but the prob- .

lem for consumers is more serious
than that.

According to William Duffy,
author of “Sugar Blues,” refined
white sugar has absolutely no nutri-
tional value and is, in fact, a “non-
food.”

The popular myth about sugar is
that it provides quick energy, but
what it actually does, upon inges-
tion, is shock the body into a tem-
porary state of diabetes. Insulin is
released from the pancreas in order
to counteract the rise in blood glu-
cose, and the body must use its
resources to process a chemical
that is providing nothing nourishing
for the body in return.

Thus, in addition to tooth decay,
sugar is responsible for illnesses and

deﬁciencies in the body that may»

rear up in such ways as depression,
low‘ resistance or hyperactivity.

The concern for good, decent
nutrition should be atop, priority

nd.

Meat should be consumed in
moderation, and the less fat, the bet-
ter. While meat is a source of pro-
tein, it contains fats that inhibit
digestion and add calories. Beans
and sprouts, if available, are a tre-
mendous source of protein, and

they are much easier to digest.

It is not impossible for students to

achieve a well-balanced diet if cau-

tion and intelligence are applied to
eating’ habits,‘ but the importance of

eating properly has been a sadly
neglected subject in a society that
encourages young people, more
than any other group eat without
discretion.

  Obesity:

A Big

Issue On Campus

Many college “students who
are overweight became that way
because of poor eating habits
they acquired while living on
campus. The Student _ Health
Service, located in Brackenridge
Hall, offers a weight reduction
program for Pitt students, free of
charge, to help them shedthose
extra pounds. "

Patty Verdi, the registered die-
tician at the Student Health Ser-
vice takes the “behavioral
approach”’ to treat weight
patients. The basic premise of
this approach is that if a student
is overweight, it’s a result of the
eating habits he has acquired, so

A Verdi works at behavior modifi-
cation, teaching students good
eating habits. 

Before a student starts on the
program, he must get a referral
from a physician or the Student
Health Center nurse to deter-
mine whether the student really
does have a weight problem.

If he qualifies, Verdi has them

j ‘fill out a nutritional history ques-
tionnaire, which asks about eat-
ing habits, food likes and
dislikes, food purchasing, prepa-
ration and lifestyle (where they
eat).

Verdi studies and analyzes
these forms to determine how
the student’s present eating hab-
its can be improved.

“I look at what they have been
eating, hopefully they are honest
and I start to eliminate anything

a balanced one,” Verdi said.

Food restriction is done
according to calories.

“It doesn’t matter when the
student eats, it’s the amount of
calories they take in a day.
Although ‘everyone is different,
on the average, I cut my patients
back about 500 calories a day,”
she said.

Verdi offers special guidelines
for weight conscious students
who eat in the cafeteria.

“It’s okay to have agsandwich
and fresh fruit for’ lunch. The
only problem with fruit is that it is
not always available in the
cafeteria or it is canned insyrup.
Students would be wise to drink
fruit juices for breakfast which
are available in the cafeteria, or
to stock up on fresh fruits and
keep them in the dorm.-

“For dinner, I give my patients
a paper with portion si_zes so

\

ounce portion size of meat that

they are allowed.”
“Fortunately, in the cafeteria

the meat is served as a standard

three-ounce serving. It’s eating ,

at restaurants where you really
have to be careful.”

“Also, at dinner, I advise stu-
dents to stay away from gravies,
sauces and casseroles because
they have hidden calories that.
the student isn’t able to figure
out. I also encourage the use of
the salad bar.” .

Verdi advises exercise for stu-
dents who want to lose weight
faster.

“If they want to, students can
do calisthenics (Calisthenics are
gymnastic-type exercises such
as jumping jacks, leg kicks,
squats, stretching and bending
exercises.) for about 20 minutes
a day in the lobby or dorms.
They can also take a walk or take
the steps instead of the
elevator.”

Verdi stresses the fact that it is
up to the student to lose weight.

“The student really has to
want to lose the weight. They
have to motivated. I’ll do every-
thing I can to give them sugges-
tions, but it’s really just a matter
of eating less.”

Ninety-five percent of all diet-

. ing Americans go through what
is called the “yoyo syndrome.”
They manage to lose weight with
a fad diet, a one-week regi-
mented diet or a physician pres-
cribed diet, only to gain lost
weight back a week, a month or
a year later.

Why is it so difficult for the I

majority of Americans to main-
tain weight loss? Part of the
answer lies in the fact that the
cause of obesity is still unknown.

“The common belief that it’s
just people overeating is not
accurate. There are a lot of
mechanisms involved in weight
accumulation, fat accumulation
and the whole problem of
obesity.

“We know many factors that
are involved, but we don't know
the specifics, which is true of a
lot of other illnesses. If we don't
know the cause of a disease, it’s
pretty hard to cure it, so we talk
in terms.of controlling weight,”
said Dr. Alphonse Cipriani.

tioner, owner and acting physi-

area. He has been supervising
the weight loss of approximately
250 patients for the past eight
years at his clinics, and is proud
of his 15-20 percent success rate
of patients maintaining their
weight loss, as compared to the 5
percent national average.

Although the factors involved
in gaining weight range from
hereditary traits and poor eating
habits to hormonal imbalances,
80 to 90 percent of the time,
Cipriani recommends a low car-
bohydrate diet to his patients.

“In the last 20 to 25 years, diet-
ing has become a very contro-
versial area,” he said. “The
American public has been inun-
dated through the media with
the thought of ‘don’t over-
consume saturated fats.’ As a
result, we’ve become cholesterol
conscious.” -

“There’s a school of thought
that I subscribe to that says that
the sugars and starches we con-
sume are much more damaging
than the fats to our arteriole cir-
culation. They cause more hard-
ening of the arteries.”

“For a patient who is over-
weight or obese, if you reduce
their body weight by letting them
eat the fats but limiting their car-
bohydrate intake, when they

lose the excess body fat, their ‘

weight reduces and their choles-
‘trol does, too.” I

Patients on the limited carbo-
hydrate diet program are
instructed to eat foods such as
chicken, fish, pork, lettuce, spin-

‘ ach, broccoli, cabbage, celery

and eggs, all of which have a zero
carbohydrate value. Cheese is
allowed, even though it has a
trace amount of sugar, to make it
easier for the patient to comply
with the diet.

Other types'of diets, such as

fad-diets, (When only one or two-

things are eaten for a time period
ranging from a couple of days to

~ if one is overweight. The military,
’ police and fire departments all

weeks.) have certain drawbacks,
according to Cipriani.

“Fad-diets can be risky if a per-
son is on them for any significant
length of time because a vitamin
deﬁciency can occur. They also
can develop deficiency states
which can lead to medical
complications.”

“For example, vitamin B is not
stored in the body. A person
who goes on a crash or fad-diet
can become depleted of his
vitamin B, which can cause med-
ical problems for him,” he said.

Cipriani also said that caloric
diets are especially difficult for
the college students who live on
campus because they are not
preparing their own. meals.

What many overweight peo—'

ple don’t realize is that being
overweight may be dangerous.
According to Cipriani, if you are
20 to 30 percent overweight, you
risk serious medical problems.
The‘risk of diabetes increases
almost 50 percent if you are 30
percent overweight.

The risk of hypertension (high
blood pressure) and coronary
artery disease increases
markedly if you are 20 to 30 per-
cent overweight, and , the life
span decreases by three to five
years. Also, the suicide rate
increases with obesity.

“Weight has other implica-
tions,” Cipriani said. “Today, we
know statistically that it’s harder
for people that are overweight to
get a job when they go out into
the job market. Most employers
discriminate against ' heavy peo-
ple because there is more absen-
teeism due to illness.

“Also, depending upon the
occupation, there is a risk factor

have weight requirements. Even
a local cheerleader was bounced
out because she exceeded the
weight limit.”

Anorexia and Bulimia

The Hidden
Nightmare

Karen Carpenter, dead at age
32, suffered from a disease so
many young women suffer from.
The young performer suffered
from anorexia nervosa—self-
starvation. Although she was
getting better, her body could no
longer handle the stress the dis-
ease had caused.

The sister disease to anorexia,
bulimia, is another serious dis-
ease that affects more young
women than we may like to
think.

Anorexia and bulimia are two
psychological eating disorders
we’ve read and heard a lot about,
but how many of us have friends
who have these diseases-
friends who either starve them-
selves or self-induced vomiting in -
order to stay thin?

Pitt is not exempt from facing
these disorders. There are many
who are suffering alone, and no
percentages can be calculated
‘because it is a‘“hidden disease”.

Judy, a pretty and popular
senior, suffers from a combina-
tion of the two diseases. Some
days she starves herself, allow-
ing only lettuce and water to
pass through her lips.

On other days, she will buy
boxes of cookies, cupcakes and
potato chips’—and binge. Latei',
feeling depressed and fearful of
gaining weight, she forces a
toothbrush down her throat until
she vomits everything she has
eaten.

According to the National
‘Anorexia Aid Society, Inc. news-
letter, anorexia is defined as the
“self-induced starvation syn-
drome.” The anorectic restricts
calorie intake, uses laxatives and
diuretics and self-induces vomit-
ing to lose “the fearful weight.”

It is a psychological disorder
because the anorectic, however
thin she may be, thinks that she
is fat and dislikes herself for it. 95
percent of the victims are
women, according to the NAAS
newsletter, and the reason why
these women suffer from the dis-
ease varies.

The young women find the
only way to handle the expecta-
tions and pressures of everyday
life is to feel they have complete
control of their bodies. In fact,
they have lost all control and
abuse their bodies in their strug-
gle to deal with problems.

The anorectic feels that she
can handle her problems if she is
thin. Physiologically, according
to the NAAS newsletter, the dis-
ease slows down vital physiologi-
cal processes. Menstrual
periods cease, body tempera-
ture lowers and there is a dis-
function of the thyroid gland.

Dr. John B. Reinhart, director
of the Division of Behavioral
Sciences at Children’s Hospital

. and professor of pediatric psy-
. chiatry at Pitt, said that ano-

rexia, like cancer, is sometimes
treatable and sometimes not.

“Teenagers, growing and
changing from little girls to
young women, are becoming
responsible for themselves,”

Reinhart said. “Sometimes, anx- -

iety and fear of sexual feelings
drive them to handle their prob-
lems through these disorders.”

He said that most people are
irrational to begin with and their
subconscious controls their way
of thinking much of the time.

» “The. 'an9recti$., . is. .sUi°.‘d‘i?“- .

   

They have to become more
mature and sure of themselves
before they can control these
disorders. When they learn they
can become intimate with some-
one without destruction to them-
selves, they're on their way to
getting better,” Reinhart said.

Few cases are seen at the Uni-
versity Health Center. Because
it is such a hidden disease, girls
are reluctant to admit to them-
selves that they have -the dis-
ease, according to Alan Mabry,
graduate student assistant at the
Counseling and Student Devel-
opment Center.

“We don’t see tomany co-eds
with these _problems because
they first have to admit they have
the disease,” he said. “We see
more bulimics than anorectics,
but they also deny the problem.”

“I believe we have more cases
of bulimia because that disease
provides the best of both worlds.
They can eat but also maintain

» their weight. We see approxi-
mately five to ten (bulimic) girls V

per year.”

Some feel that bulimia is an
expression of anger.-Mabry said
therapists differ in the treatment
of the disorder, he believes the
family is very much involved and
tries to use family counseling to
help the victims.

“Studies show that seven to
ten percent of university girls
have the disease, but I’m assum-
ing that a huge number of cases
don’t come in for help,” Mabry
said:

Kandy Miller, who is in charge
of the nurses at the Health Cen-
ter, said the students who suffer
from these disorders are usually
seen by physicians and later sent
to the counseling center.

“We see about two people
with anorexia and bulimia per
semester, but the number varies
so you really can’t state a per-
centage of students who have
the disease,” Miller said. “Some
are unwilling to receive treat-
ment, and sending them to the
gounselors is the best thing to

0.”

She said that the Health Cen-
ter provides support for them
but they need more help than
just an ambulatory center can
offer. The symptoms are physio-
logical, yet the real concerns are
the psychological symptoms
that must be treated, according
to Miller.

One way of treating the ano-
rectic relies on behavioral modi-
fication. Dr. Hsu, a specialist in
treating the two kinds of dis-
eases at Western Institute and
Clinic, said that changing the
behavior of the young women
will ready them for a normal life.

“The program I have set up
provides that the anorectic is
required to eat a minimum of
calories a clay,” Hsu said. “They
are admitted to the hospital and
under my care until they reach a
desirable weight. They are given
a certain number of caloriesper
meal, and if they refuse to eat
they are restricted to their
rooms.”

The system for the anorectic
is almost like a reward system, in
that if the patient gains a certain
amount of pounds, they are
allowed to leave their rooms. If
they gain more weight, they are
allowed to stay up later and
watch television. '

enough weight to be allowed to
leave the hospital for outside
visits.

Donna, a healthy and attrac-
tive junior who is involved in
sports and exercises every day,
watches everything she eats.

V Occasionally, she will be bur-

dened by problems and will buy
all the forbidden junk foods she’s
restricted herself from, and she
will eat these quickly.

She becomes terrified of gain-
ing weight and forces herself to
throw up.

She has become obessed with
this. Even after exercising for
two hours, she will vomit up a
sundae her friend has bought
her. After a while, Donna cannot
keep any food down.

“After I've been throwing ‘up
for a while, everything I eat
wants to come up,” she said. “I
feel sick after I eat anything-
even salads. It’s scary not being
able to keep food in my stomach.
The whole thing is scary.”

Donna used to have to force a
spoon down her throat to make
herself throw up; now the action
is voluntary. She is bulimic.

Like anorexia, ninety-five per-
cent of the victims of bulimia are
female, and unlike the starving
disease, the bulimic realizes their
eating disorders. According to
NAAS, the bingers do not “dis-
tort their body image.”

This is, however, more of a
hidden disease than anorexia.

~ Through excessive vomiting and

use of laxatives, the

body

becomes dehydrated. This may ,

cause hypokalemia-—low levels
of potassium in the body-as

well as kidney damage.

This also affects the teeth
through constant stomach acids
deteriorating the surface of the
teeth.

Treatment for the bulimic is
somewhat like the behavioral
modification procedure set up
by Dr. Hsu, but calorie intake is
limited and patients learn to eat
their food slowly and realize
each bite of food they consume.

The bulimic has trouble decid-
ing when to stop eating, espe-
cially during stressful situations,
and Dr. Hsu teaches them to eat
purposefully and carefully.

Dr. Reinhart believes that the
young women affected by ano-
rexia and bulimia can be helped
through psychotherapy, and he
stresses the importance of family
therapy as well.

“Parents of anoAre_c,_tics have to
learn to relax and‘  7
children to eat;':"'
forced to eat sorn ing, they
become obessed with notaeating
it. The parents should merely
have the child eat what he
wants,” Reinhart said.

   
 

These diseases do not just go
away. Through maturity and
self-confidence, though, the ano-
rectic or bulimic will feel more
secure and, sure of herself.

Pitt-Notre Dame: Can Arena, Panthers Pass Test?

By scorr DELLETT
' .‘

In past years, a Pitt-Notre Dame
matchup in any sport would have
been a. game of the year. But since
the Panther basketball team has
entered the Big East, tonight’s game
against Notre Dame is a slight break
from the tortures of conference play.
Nevertheless, the two teams will face
each other for the first time since the
1976-77 season at the Civic Arena.

The l2-9 Fighting Irish come into
the game with a four-game winning
streak—achieved during the longest
road trip of the year. Every game is
important to the Irish since they play
as an independent. However, Irish
coach Digger Phelps believes a team

  with as many as 1 1 losses couldbe in

the NCAA tournament in March.
“It’s hard to say how many wins it -

V will take to get a tournament bid,”

Phelps said. “You look around and
_see good teams with as many as nine
losses. This shows the balance in col-
lege basketball today.”

The Irish have come a long way in
improving last year’s .10-17 mark.
This improvement is due to the play
of several freshmen, Tim Kempton
being the most inﬂuential. The 6-9,

225 lb. forward /center is second on I
the team in scoring, averaging nearly

12 points a game, and leads the Irish
in_ rebounding, ‘pulling down ﬁve
boards per contest. His play, ‘along

‘ i_;&with freshman center Ken Barlow, ~

who’s averaging eight points and
four rebounds per game, has out last
year’s starting center, Tim Andre, on
the bench.

Notre Dame’s recent success on
the road has helped the team gain
confidence.

“We need to win on the road with

i all the younger players we have,”

Phelps said.

The addition of Barlow and’

Kempton to the lineup has benefited
another Irish player. Bill Varner, a
senior from Valley High School in
New Kensington, was forced to play
a power forward position, limiting
his effectiveness, even though he was
able to average 10 points and six
rebounds per game. This year,
although he shows signs of inconsis-
tency, Varner has finally come
around.

“Bill had his best game against

‘ North Carolina State,” Phelps said.

“He’s been up and down this year,
but now he’s playing with a lot of
confidence. ‘

“This year, he’s more of a swing
player or a small forward. He’s a
pure shooter who knows his shot
selection." ‘ ‘

Panther head coach Roy Chip-
man knows Varner will be ready for
the game.

“He’s going to be sky-high for this
game, coming back home,” Chip-
man said.

Chipman is more concerned with

, assists.

guard John Paxson. The 6-2, All-
America guard has picked up last
season’s pace, scoring 18 points‘ a
game while leading the team in

“I don't think anyone can stop
him,” Chipman said. “If you key on
him, he'll pass off the ball, and the
other kids will hurt us.

“John is a one-in-a-million per-
son,” Phelps said of Paxson, who
was also named to the Academic
All-America team. “He will be a first
round choice in the NBA.”

Paxson may be slowed down by a
sprained ankle. According to
Phelps, recovery is a day-to-day
process.

“John is not practicing today
[Monday], and I don’t think he’ll
practice tomorrow [yesterday],” he
said. “We have «to wait until Wednes-
day to find_ out his condition.”

‘Notre Dame may be a mystery
team to Pitt. Without the shot clock,
the Irish may slow down the tempo.

“I don’t know what to expect,”
Chipman said. “Notre Dame can do
a lot of different things.” ,

This game may be a slight letdown

-for Pitt, especially since the Villa-

i nova game is behind them and the

Georgetown game is coming up at

’ the Fitzgerald Field House on Sat-

urday. But Panther forward Trent
Johnson doesn’t agree with this, say-
ing the mystery of the Fighting Irish
will have the Panthers ready. »

“Notre Dame is Notre Dame,” he
said. “This is more than enough to
fire us up." .

The competition in the Big East,
which has five teams in the top 20,
will have a positive effect on the
Panthers in the last three weeks of
the season.

“By playing in the Big East, we
have become a tougher team physi-
cally, mentally and emotionally,”
Chipman _said. “That's the ' great
thing about playing in this league. ”

This game is not only a reunion of
the two teams but an important fac-
tor in determining the future of Pitt
basketball games at the Civic Arena.

6 The attendence tonight will decide if

Pitt will move any games downtow
in the future. '
“When I meet a team, I feel more
comfortable in our kitchen than
someplace else,” Chipman said.
“Our main purpose is to bring good
basketball to Pittsburgh, especially
if we put 14,000 people in the Arena.
If we put only eight or nine thousand

and we get our fannies kicked, I‘

won't be ‘too happy.”

Chipman believes playing Notre’

Dame at the Arena is a good test.

“If you can’t draw from the big-
gest alumni group in the area [Notre
Dame], then I don’t know who we
can draw from.” ‘

Since the Arena is more spread"

out than the Field House, it's possi-

. ble that the crowd—one that has

made a significant contribution in
the upset wins over St. John's and

Syracuse——may be neutralized.

Chipman disagrees with this theory.

“A crowd can be noisy if they

want to be,” he said. “Our fans’
support——particularly the
students’—has been terriﬁc for the
first time since I've been at Pitt.”

Tonight’s game will be a test in
manyways.

PITT NOTES: The series will return
to South Bend next". season, but
future games aren't scheduled yet.
Chipman would like to continue
playing the Irish.

“I like to play Notre Dame,” he
said. “The quality of the school,
players and the coach is a plus to the
program.” ‘

Clyde Vaughan remains the Big
East scoringleader, averaging 21.6
points per game. The 6-4 forward is
third in rebounding, grabbing nine
per contest....Center Andre "Will-
iams is second in free throw percen-
tage shooting foul shots at an 86.4
percent clip....Over_ 9,000 tickets
have been sold for tonight’s game as
of yesterday afternoon. This number
includes two thousand student
tickets The ﬁve-dollar and most of
the four-dollar seats have been sold,
but there are plenty of general
admission tickets available. Pitt offi-
cials are hopeful of drawing over
12,000.

BigEast Swimming Championship Run At Hectic Pace

By SCOTT DELLETT

Hectic may describe the I983 Big
East Conference Swimming and

g \ Diving Championships, ‘which starts
‘' letomorrow and runs through Satur-

day. With both men’s and women’s
competition takingplace during the
three day event, things will be very
busy around Trees Pool. Just ask
Lady Panther coach David
Belowich.

' “I’ve been so busy with this meet, I‘
haven’t been able to take care of
matters with the team," Belowich,
the meet director for this tourna-
ment, said.

“This three—day event will be a

.headache for me.”

Despite the problems ofsetting up
the meet, there should ‘be some good
teams coming into Pittsburgh. Pitt,
Syracuse and Villanova are the pre-
meet favorites to take the title. None

z of the coaches, however, are willing

to accept the tag of favorite.

“Pitt should be the favorite for
both titles,” -Syracuse men’s‘and
women’s swim coach Lou Walker
said.

Belowich refused to take this title.
“I don't want the monkey an my
back,” he said. “Syracuse beat us in
dual-meet competition — they must
be called the favorites.”

Both have their reason for giving
the other top-billing.

“Syracuse is a veteran team,”
Belowich said. They area senior-

‘ljrzjunior dominated team and they

have the experience."

The Orangewomen certainly have

. the swimmers to take the first Big

,East women’s title. Syracuse fin-
ished the dual-meet season with a
9-2-1 record, losing only to Penn

me “photos

Eastern Regional Championships.
The team is composed of a nine
swimmer nucleus.

Junior Jill Klinger and sopho-
more Sarah Wortman were two
Orangewomen to break numerous
records. Klinger has swam the fas-
test I00-yard individual medley of
the season according to Walker and
has complied outstanding times in
the 200-yard freestyle and individual
medley. Wortman has given a strong
showing in the 200-yard butterfly
and the distance freestyle events.

Other Syracuse swimmers who
have contributed are junior
freestyler-specialist Connie Sne-
deker, freshman butterflier Sallie
Cinco, freshman backstroke special-

and 2 freshman .freestvler' Lv.n'n'

Haggerty. ‘

In fact, Snedeker and Cinco are
seated first in the 200-yard freestyle
and 200-yard butterﬂy respectively.

One team Belowich is wary of is
Villanova. Last year, the Lady Wild-
cats placed sixth in the AIAW Div-

ision ll national championships. Of —

that team, l3 swimmers "return,
including four All-Americas.
“You can’t overlook Villanova;

they may be the favorite," Belowich

said.

Four Lady Wildcats are seeded
either number one ortwo in the
championships. Lisa McFadden is
placed first in the 500-yard freestyle
and second in the 200-yard freestyle.

[00-yard, butterfly and ‘second, in the

‘more 3'' nef

I00-yard” backstroke while Genny
Mulderig is ranked second in the
200-yard backstroke and the 400-
yard individual medley.

According to Walker, Villanova
should finish third, behind the Or-
angewomen and the Lady Panthers.

“We have more depth than Villan-
ova," he said. .

Connecticut, St. Johns and Bos-
ton College could finish in the next
tier of teams. The Huskies’ main
strength is in the breastroke events,
as top retur-n'ers are Leigh Anne
Delea, a junior All-‘America, senior
Sandra Wyatt and sophomore
Claire Viola. St. John’s placed sixth
in the EAIAW championships last

Eagles have three All-America

swimmers in sophomores Mary
Kennedy, Denise Callahan and
Linda Dixon.

Both Georgetown and Seton Hall
are relatively young teams and
should finish near the bottom.

Despite the Lady Panthers prob-
lems during the season, losing the
first five dual-meets, Pitt came back
and walloped West Virginia and
Kent State.

“It was frustrating not winning,”
Belowich said. “Everyone likes to
win. We had an excellent meet
against West Virgnia and a very
good meet against Kent State, and
this gives us an extremely good atti-
tude going into the Big East
championships.”

According to Belowich, the Lady
Panthers can win the championship
if everyone on the team contributes.

“We have to have everyone
score,” he said. “We need an excel-
lent effort from all 18 people.

“Jan (Ujevich) and’ Sue (Heon)
are going to win a number of events,
and Diana Firth, Wendy Morgan
and Alicia Dugan should be near the
top. But more importantly, people

like Georgie Skolsky and Laura‘-

Barber have to finish in the top six
and Cristen Zaleski and Estelle
Grant need to finish in the top 12."

Another aspect which will be

, important will be the two diving

events. The points gained in these
events could swing the difference in
winning and losing a championship.

“Diving is not big in the total per-
cent of scoring, but it is -more of a
factor in the addition of points a
swim team’s total,” diving, coach
Julian Krug said.

to work out any kinks and learn to

should be underlined. This year,

number of players who left last year.

the Panthers spent the next three

State was earlier thought to be the

By CHARLIE O'HARA

If someone had told Rick Asberry
four years ago that he would be com-
ing off a fall of rigorous training for

3,. , his. senior track season at Pitt in
‘H “K 1983, his reaction would have been

something like this: “Maybe I’ll be at

Pitt, but as for training for track in

the fall, you’re crazy!”

At the time, Asberry would have
had a good right to believe this. Four
years ago, he had just ﬁnished an
outstanding high school football
career. As a senior at McKinley
High School in Canton, Ohio,
Asberry was a Parade All-America
running back and one of the most

highly regarded players in the coun- *

try. He could have gone to any
school in the country on a football
scholarship; he chose Pitt.

After two years of frustration due

~ _ to lack of playing time and injuries,
I‘ he decided to run track.

It was a tough decision because he
hadn’t run track since his senior year
in high school. He was a junior, and
the adjustment was considered not
only difficult, but not worthwhile -
the Pant/her track program was
fizzling. .

These facts had nothing to do with
his decision. “Football demanded
too much time, and I wasn’t doing
anything productive,” Asberry said.

M‘ Asberry Changes

Midstream

thing other than football practices,
so I decided to run track."

So far this year, the team has sur-
prised just about everyone involved

and Asberry sees his senior year in a

new light.

“The new coaches (head coach
John Vasvary and assistant Steve
Lewis) have put together a real team,
not just a group of individuals, like
last year,” he said. “The ride home
from the VMI meet had an atmos-
phere that was totally different from
anything that had existed a year ago.
Everyone was excited because we
realized ‘that we could be something
as a team.”

There is definitely a mutual feel-
ing on the coaching side.

“He has been a leader since Sep-
tember,” Vasuary said. “Before
Coach Lewis arrived Rickran the
workouts.;He is respected by ever-
y_one on the team, and he has done a

very credible job. We are very fortu- ‘

nate to have Rick Asberry on this
team.” ’ ' ' -

' “Rick has been a real help to the
coaching staff,” Lewis said. “It is
almost as though he is more excited
about being a part of this team than
we, the coaches, are.”

Asberry recently qualified for the

Intercollegiate Amateur Athletic

Association of America (IC4A)

championships in the 55-meter dash .

Swimmers Go For g
First Championship

‘continued from page fifteen

Although having a squad loaded
with freshmen, Krug believes both
men's and women’s diving squad
could make a significant impression
in the championships.

“We have to be the favorite going
in because we have more depth,” he
said. “All our divers are going to
score points.

“We have some reasonable chan-
ces to have one or more champions,
but it isn’t going to be easy.”

On the women’s side, Syracuse's
Betsy Spiegel and Boston College's
Sue Bales are going to be competi-
tion to Lady Panther Yvonne John-
ston. Spiegel was the NCAA Eastern
Regional champion in 1982 while
Bales earned All-America honors.

For the men, Lester Schloen of St.

John’s and junior Mike Bowden for ‘

Syracuse, last year’s Big East Out-
standing Diver of the Year will chal-
lenge for the championship. Bowden
holds the Big East record for both
one- and three-meter diving events.

In the men’s swimming compete-
tion, the same three teams—
Syracuse, Pitt and Villa-
nova—should contend for the
championships.

The Orangemen are two-time Big
East defending champions, but they
lost Ed Lalor and Al Kitto, named
Outstanding Swimmers in the 1982
championships.

Syracuse is led by distance free-
styler Chris Black and Matt DePie-
tro, breaststroke specialist Scott
Henry and Mike Wright, who
missed last season with a back
injury. ’

“We got a strong group of
swimmers,” Walker said. We had
some real good swims.”

Villanova has ten returning letter-
men, along with three freshmen. The
Big East runner-ups in 1982 have

' defeated.“ Georgetown, 97-13 and

Connecticut, 91-21 in dual meet
action. Seniors Bob Ackerman,

Three-time Big East champion
John Trites along with 13 returning

Pittsburgh with aspirations of a

100- and 200-yard backstroke
events. '

~ St. John’s comes into the cham-
pionships with a dual-meet win over

Connecticut and returnees Brian
Dieterich and Scott Haberstroh.
Both set Big East records in the 100-
yard breaststroke and-+00-yard but-
terﬂy respectively.

Pitt is definitely a favorite to take
the championship in its first year of
competition in the Big East. The
Panthers have already been under
Big East record times in six events.
Ed Bergan set records in the 100-
and 200-yard backstroke while jun-
ior J.D. McCrillis has been-
successful in the 100- and 200-yard
freestyle.

Freshman Don Martin has pro-
vided Pitt with versatility, breaking
the Big East mark in the 200-yard
individual medley and is undefeated
_in the 200-yard breaststroke.

Also making contributions are
seniors Jerry Zaleski and Pete Boyle
and junior Geoff Emore.

If nothing else, the Big East
‘Championship should provide a les-
son in time management. It should
give swimming fans some real
excitement.

. as well as a member of the‘ 1600-

meter relay team. He holds the
school record in the 55-meter dash
(6.2) despite the fact that he is still
short on technique.

“He has been improving
technique-wise everyday,” Lewis
said. “He is performing better every
meet from the technique standpoint,
and right now he would have to be
considered one of the best sprinters
in the Big East."

Asberry has been able to do any-'

thing that the coaches have asked.
“He is the best short sprinter we
have, but he has also been there
every time we’ve needed someone,”
Lewis said. “He has run the 300-
meter run, filled in on relays and
done a credible job. He has made a
significant contribution with his
positive approach to everything.”
The only thing that upset Asberry

_,is that this is his final year of

competition.
“I really wish I could run with

as an individual (preferably) or as a
member of a relay team. As for the

team, he believes the Panthers have .

a good chance at the Big East cham-
pionships this weekend. He also sees
Pitt improving during the remainder
of the indoor season and into the
outdoor season.

Concerning this week’s trip to
Syracuse, Asberry believes a couple
of things will have to happen.

“We will all have to give every-
thing that we have,” he said. “The
best teams in the conference are
Connecticut and Villanova, and it
will take a great effort if we plan on
beating them.”

“For me, I will be facing some
pretty tough competition. Mike
Morris of Syracuse is really tough. I

, just want to be very competitive, and

hopefully things will work out.”
Lewis had some similar opinions.
“Both Mike Morris, the returning
Big East champion, and Carl Dean
of Connecticut are very competi-'
tive,” he said.i“They are the two big
guys in the conference left from last

these guys next year," he said.
“There is something special here.”
Upon entering the season, the
team came up with a motto: “We
want the seniors to feel bad about -

year, though a lot of new faces will
be present because of all the excel-
lent recruits that the Big East confer-
ence draws.”

' . leaving.” This is just the feeling that

 Asberry will have at the season’s

  

end.

Trailing by three points with only
one event remaining, the Panther
gymnastics team rallied to a 261.7-
260.6 victory over unheralded Kent

' State at the Golden-.Flash’s home
floor Saturday.

“The better team won, though
Kent State should have,” coach
Frank D‘Amico said following the
Panthers come-from-behind vic-
tory. “We were down after the first
three events (the floor exercise, the
pommel horse and the rings).”

The Panthers were led by fresh-
man Matt Pieters, who captured the
high bar (9.1) and the parallel bars
(9.1). Junior Frank Kratz won the
vault (9.6) on his way to another
all-around championship (52.95).

The other Panther victory was
recorded by freshman Marc Klafter
in the rings with a score of 8.8.

Several other Panthers also ﬁn-
ished quite respectably.

In the floor exercise, Dave Smith
was second (9.4), as was Mike Lloyd
on the pommel horse (8.85) and
Chris Femiani on the rings (8.7).

The Panthers were continually the
objects of partisanjuclging. “Usually
the judge will take off 1/ l0 or 2/ 10
of a point for a mistake, but they
were taking off one-half of a point
for every mistake we made,”
D’Amico said.

The judging may have played
havoc with the Panthers, but it
wasn’t enough to knock them out of
the competition. They showed that
when the meet is on the line, they can
come through.

Following the opening three
events, the Panthers found them-
selves on the brink of disaster. They
were failing to connect on anything.
In the vault, they had two major
breaks resulting in point reductions
that, at the time, appeared
insurmountable.

D‘Amico considered Kent State a
mystery team because he had not
only not seen any of its scores from
this year, but also the Panthers had
not competed against it in six years.

“They (Kent State) turned out to
be tough competition," he said.
“Last time we faced them, it wasn’t a
contest. Now they are almost as

good as we are."

'With the competition that the
Panthers’ have faced and will face,
this victory should definitely pro-
vide some optimism for a hobbling

more than seven or eight competi-

The victory was significant in
another respect. The Panther fresh-

man class, which D’Amico regards
as one of his best, came through in
the moment of need. Both Peters
and Klafter have been consistent all
year, but their presence was even

for three of the Panthers’ four indi-
vidual victories.

D’Amico has many times said that
it takes consistent scores over 270 to
get ranked in the top zu, and ne
believes that the Panthers would be
capable of scoring 270s if they had
freshman Kevin Garren, whose torn
ligaments may well have hurt the
Panthers’ chances of a possible top
20 ranking.

Some positive aspects emerged
from Saturday’s,victory. However,
the Panthers have their work cut out
for them as Pitt faces powers Penn
State and Ohio State. The Panthers,
so stricken with injuries, will have
both to step up in class and to win in
order to qualify for Nationals. H   4. ..

the Civic Arena at 5:45 p.m., but
third-year coach Judy Saurer
doesn't think her team has the home-
field advantage.

“We‘ve never played in the
arena—the last time was several
years ago against Maryland," she
said. “I'm sure Roy Chipman (men’s
basketball coach) will agree that
he’d rather play at the (Fitzgerald)
Field House.”

Two years ago, Pitt beat the
Hoyas at the Fitzgerald Field
House, but lost to them last vear
76-69.

“We’ll try to forget that game,”
Saurer said. “Right now, the team is
playing well. I’m sure they (her play-
ers) realize that this is an important
Big East game. We want to run the
ball, and we should do all right.

“Georgetown likes to use trapping
defenses-—full court pressure, some
man-to-man. Sometimes they play a
2-3 defense, and we have the talent
to shoot from the outside in Lori
Lewman and Stephanie Collins.”

Last week, the Hoyas squeaked
past Syracuse, who has the third best
record in the Big East, by a score of
68-66. Georgetown, coached by
Steve Hurlbut, is 7-11 overall and
1-3 in the Big East as he brings his
team to town.

In the Hoya starting lineup is
sophomore Allison Westbrooks, the
leading scorer and rebounder with
l2.5 points per game and 8.]
rebounds. At center is 6-4 Wadina
Davis, and the forwards are fresh-
man Jenny Bendeal (6.4 ppg and 6.4
rebounds) and 6-2 Diane Tolliver.
Tolliver was averaging 9.8 ppg and
5.6 rebounds before being sidelined
with an injury. She is listed as ques-
tionable for the game. Guards Lora
Gill (9 ppg, 36 assists this season)
and Cissy Babiarz (6.7 ppg, 52
assists) complete the starting lineup.

The Lady Panthers are riding a
five-game winning streak, during
which last week’s Big East Player-of-
the-Week, Jennifer Bruce, averaged
24.6 points and 14.4 rebounds per
game. The sophomore forward
scored a career—high 34 points, lead-
ing Pitt to an upset victory over
nationally-ranked Penn State this
weekend.
