Nation's homele

The sharply rising numbers of
homeless families is generating a
desperate demand for help on
the order of a natural calamity,
shelter operators say.

“We are looking into the face
of a national disaster of
unprecedented proportions,” said
Dr. Irwin Redlener, a pediatrician
who treats homeless children in
New York. “It’s an insidious
disaster, absolutely overwhelming
compared to Hurricane Hugo or
the San Francisco quake.”

Jean Demaster said she has not
had a vacancy in her Portland,
Ore., shelter for months, and
many families are in the shelter.

“We didn’t see anything like

‘ this until affordable housing

began to disappear in the last
four or five years," Demasters
said. “The only future we can see
is the federal government
restoring the housing budget.”

During the Reagan
administration, the federal
housing budget was slashed from
$52 billion in 1982 to $6.5 billion
in 1989.

In that time more Americans
estimates range from 655,000 to
three million. And, “the problem
isn’t going away,” said Rep. Bruce
Vemo (D—Minn.) who has
proposed $700 million for
emergency shelters, job training

‘, and mental and physical health

care for the homeless in 1991-92.

Emergency funding has helped
localities meet immediate needs,
but advocates are impatient with
the government’s lack of long-
range solutions.

“There’s been no serious effort
to prevent homelessness,” said
Fulton County (Ga.)
Commissioner Nancy Boxhill, a
psychologist who runs three
shelters in Atlanta. Homelessness
there is up 15 percent this year.

The American Affordable
Housing Institute is urgently
warning that many “hidden
homeless” —— 14 million people
now doubled- and tripled—up in
housing — are on the brink of
landing in the streets.

What some groups across the

country are doing:
Los Angeles: Harbor
Interfaith, among 62 programs in
the city for homeless families,
runs three shelters; executive
director David Christiansen said
he’s seen a 30 percent increase in
the number of homeless families
in the last two years. Many have
jobs but can’t afford housing.

— Phoenix: Central Arizona
Shelter Services, organized after
the homeless established a tent
city between City Hall and the
state Capitol, shelters 750 people,
including 40 families. Director
Mary Orton said the problem
escalated when the city tore down
low-income housing in an inner-
city area “to clean up the city.”
Minneapolis: Elim
Transitional Housing, the first
family-oriented program in the
state, opened in 1983 to search

ss families increase

for rental property for homeless
families. Now there are more
than 30 such programs in the
state. Most tenants can stay in
their neighborhoods and
eventually take over rental of
their unit, paying an average of
$300 a month.

—— Detroit: The Coalition on
Temporary Shelter, one of two
family shelters in the city, houses
17 families in 142 beds. “We have
husbands laid off, spousal abuse
and lots of single-parent families,”
said registration supervisor
Donald Montgomery. He noted
an increase in the number of
families needing help because
of crack use by women.

—— Cleveland: The East Side
Catholic Shelter, one of eight
family shelters in the city, houses
10 families, mostly women with
children, said co-founder Juanita
McPherson. Programs “help the
children deal with their fear and
anger” about being homeless, she
said. The shelter provides housing
for up to 14 days, counseling,
two bus tickets a day, food and
recreation programs.

— Atlanta: A study by the city’s "

Task Force for the Homeless
showed 70 percent of those calling
a 24-hour hotline were members
of homeless families. Nearly half
had jobs, and they were spending
70 percent of their income on
rent. Among 80 area shelters is
the House of Hope, with 14 beds,
now filled by members of three
families.

Male contraceptives
sign of new attitudes

By Jennifer Calabrese
Staff Writer

The development of the male
birth control pill is just one of the
signs of the changing attitudes in
our society, according to Joseph
Hall, assistant professor of
biochemistry at Pennsylvania
State University.

“With the advent of women’s
lib and a new move towards
equality between men and
women I think that a male birth
control pill will be readily
accepted once it is released,”
Hall said.

Hall began researching the
possibility of developing a male

‘ birth control about five years ago

under a $269,000 grant from the
National Science Foundation.

“At that time we used the money
to initiate stage one of the project.
This involved identifying the
proteins that effect the motility
and fertility of the sperm cells,”
Hall said.

Hall said that his research
marked a change in the approach
that earlier projects had taken
toward the development of a
male pill;

“Earlier studies concentrated on
the testes, which is the organ
where the sperm are actually
produced. We decided to focus
on the epididyis, an organ which
is attached to the testes,” he said.

“The key is the changes that
the sperm, undergo while they
are in the epididyis. While they

are in the caput region they they _

cannot move and can’t fertilize or
recognize an egg. After passing
through the

region they are capable of these
things.”

Hall said that his research is
concentrated in identifying what
compounds initiate this Change.

“Right now we are in the
beginning of stage two of the
project. We have identified several
compounds and we are currently

African nationality  
room to be dedicated

The African Heritage Classoom, the 22nd Nationality Room
to open since the first rooms were dedicated in 1938, will be
formally dedicated on Sunday, Dec. 17.

“We have been fund raising for the room since 1972. It takes
a lot of money to open a Nationality Room and involves
working for a long time,” said Ilene Kiley, staff member of the
Nationality Rooms Department. The final cost is estimated at

The dedication will begin with a private room blessing at 1:30
p.m. by Dr. J.H. Kwabena Nketia, a native of Ghana and
chairman of Pitt’s department of music.

After the blessing, an invitation-only dedication will be held
in the Commons Room. Over 1,000 donors, including university
faculty, staff and students, as well as several African ambassadors
to the United States will attend, said Maxine Bruhns, director of
the Nationality Rooms and intercultural exchange programs.

The room's architecture is styled after an Asante village
courtyard typical of Ghana, located in West Africa. The African
Heritage Classroom is located at Room 330 in the Cathedral of

“I think that the room is well-designed,” said Nketia, adding
that it adheres to Asante tradition.

Highlights of the room include the entrance door depicting
the ancient kingdoms of Africa. Inside there is a plaster hand-
sculptured frieze, with 30 forms that represent African science,

Glass display cases protect African artifacts, one of which is
a f1ve—foot traditional wood sculpture given to Pitt by the
Embassy of Malawi. It shows the process of a youth’s initiation

The room’s design features a straw-thatched rim below the
ceiling, deep red Wainscot and benches, and window screens
fabricated in intricate geometric forms.

The first public viewing of the room will be on Sunday, Dec.

T ec/analogy of the 19805 can be tracea’ to 1939 advances

Byjohn Hillkirk
©Copyright 1989, USA
TODAY/Apple College

Information Network

Ask any 70-year-old what he
or she remembers most vividly
about 1939, and the answer
might be the lingering
Depression. Or Europe being
plunged into war. Or Franklin
D. Roosevelt’s “New Deal.”

Now zoom forward 50 years
to 1989. Consider the
technologies that permeate
modern society: computers and
copiers in our offices. Microwave
ovens in our kitchens. TVs in
our living rooms. High-speed
jets for traveling.

Guess what? Every one of
those technologies appeared in
1939: The United States’ John
Atanasoff built the first computer.
Chester Carlson patented his
Xerox copier. RCA launched TV
at the New_York World’s Fair.
Germans ﬂew the first jet-
powered plane. Brits came up
with microwave technology to

detect enemy planes.

No one is sure why so much
happened at once, but 1939 was
the most important year for
technological breakthroughs in
modern times. Few of us could
make it through the day without
using a product dating back to
that incredible year.

Other years have seen similar
coincidental breakthroughs. In
1876, the car engine. and
telephone were invented within
two weeks of each other. Soon
after that, Thomas Edison’s
incandescent light bulb ﬂickered
into life. ,

As often happens, the
inventors had a miserable time
convincing people that their
ideas would work. The inventors
stuck with it though, often at

great personal expense. Here’s_

a glimpse of what a few of them

experienced:
— Atanasoff, an Iowa State
professor, spent years

performing routine math on IBM
calculators. He knew there must
be a better way. One night in

1937, he got in his car and
began driving across Iowa. He
wound up, 200 miles later, at a
bar in Illinois.

On his second drink, a ﬂash.

of genius hit him from nowhere:
Build a computer that used Base
2 — a series of “1s” and “Os” —
instead of the traditional Base
10. In'1959, his first prototype
appeared. It could only add or
subtract eight-digit numbers.

Nobody really paid any
attention.
But Atanasoffs discovery laid

the foundation for ENIAC, the
world’s first general purpose
computer, which made its debut
in 1946.

(Lightning struck twice: In the
’50s, Atanasoff approached the
Norwegian president of Timex
with another idea —— a battery-
powered watch. Ten years later,
Timex built a battery watch
factory in India.)

—— Unbeknownst to each

other, Frank Whittle and Hans
von Ohain simultaneously
developed the jet engine.
Germany’s von Ohain wanted
to get rid of the rumbling piston
engine because it destroyed the
beauty of ﬂight. The solution:
Throw the piston away and
substitute a quieter turbine
powered by liquid fuel. Britain's
Whittle, a Royal Air Force cadet,
reached a similar conclusion.
He asked the English Air Ministry
for support but was turned down
ﬂat. “Despite the threat of war,
we nearly went broke,” said
Whittle, now living in Maryland.
The world ignored the jet
engine until the late 19405. Van
Ohain said that if the British
government had backed
Whittle’s work, there might not
have been a World War 11. His
reasoning: Jet-powered planes
could have tom the Luftwaffe to
pieces.

is active in the project, explained
that the youths belong to one of
five houses that are a part of the
state—run Circle C program.

“This is a program for juveniles
withtrouble at home. We have
adopted one house made up of
eight boys, ages 12 to 16.”

The brothers became involved
in their work as an effort to offer
service to the community.

Kwame Dixon, an alumni of
the fraternity who enjoys
remaining active in its affairs,
said, “Unlike a lot of non—minority
fraternities we’re founded on
service to the community. We
would like to pay back the
community in some way for what
theyfve given us.”

The youths were not
immediately receptive of the idea
of opening up to their older
brothers, according to fraternity
member David J. Smith.

“They were a little skeptical at
ﬁrstf’ Gleaton said.

“They would try to test us to be
sure that we wanted to be there,
not that we had to be there,”
Smith added.

Recently the brothers went to
visit the house and took along
Christmas dinner and some gifts
for the boys. Smith said that
though they have to wait for
Christmas day to open the
presents, the evening went well
and members “talked to the little
brothers for a while and found
out what they wanted out of life. ”

“What we've basically done is
set it up so that they can call us or
we can call them anytime. We’re

acting as role models,” he said. .
“We’re helping them to learn how

to deal with other people by
teaching respect. We will respect
them and vice versa.”

the importance of helping the
teenagers improve their ability to
deal with other people, in their
private and social lives, during
their stay at the Circle C house
and after they return home.

“We just came in to give them
a positive feeling that someone
does care about them. They’re
not alone and there is someone
out there,” Gleaton said.

In addition to visiting the house,
a wider variety of activities
between the youths and the
fraternity is hoped to continue in
the future. A basketball
competition has been set up and
they are planning to initiate a
tutoring program.

Gleaton said, “We asked them

basketball and so we went ahead

“We’ve got a friendly rivalry

Dixon explained that he feels

youths than a house master

Still, Carlson was unable to

Luftwaffe.

Bush, former President
Roosevelt’s science adviser,
mobilized teams of scientists at
five labs — Bell Labs, Cal Tech,
Harvard, MIT and the Carnegie

Albert Einstein proposed in a
letter to Roosevelt in 1939.

engine.

seven years of intensive research

have slowed to a trickle. The
secret is to look for ideas in the
strangest of places, many of them
unknown or small. To make
giant leaps, you must consider
ideas that sound outlandish, even
faintly ridiculous —— and have
the confidence to bet your
company on them.

UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

By Thomas Danyluk
Staff Writer

Dennis Scott, in all likelihood, will
probably never have a night like he did
last night. And Pitt Panthers aren't too
thrilled that the junior forward from Georgia
Tech picked them to witness it first hand.

Scott, a 6-8 forward, pouring in a career
high 42 points on 14 of 26 shooting —
including 8-14 from three—point range —
and hit the game winning basket at the
buzzer to lead the 19th ranked
Yellowjackets to a breathtaking 93-92 win
over the 17th ranked Pitt Panther in the
opening game of the ACC/Big East
Challenge.

“Scott just put on a performance that
you won't see too often," said a
disheartened Pitt Panther coach Paul Evans,

who watched his club drop their second
game to an ACC school in three days. “He
played a great game.”

Panther forward Rod Brookin said, “He’ll
get his points. The best thing you can do
is try to contain him, which we had a hard
time doing.”

The Panthers, 2-2, dropped 100-87 to
NC State Saturday night. The win improved
the Yellowjackets to 3-0. '

At the onset, it appeared as if Pitt would
run away with the game, as the Panthers
bolted out to a 23-5 lead, and took a 53-
45 lead into the locker room at halftime.
Guard Darelle Porter’s 15 points and fiV€
assists paced Pitt in the first half, while
forward Rod Brookin tossed in an
additional 14.

“At one point I was hoping we’d just
keep it respectable,” said Georgia Tech

PAGE 7

coach Bobby Cremins. “They were playing
us real tough inside and we weren't hitting
too many outside shots.”

But the Yellowjackets, behind Scott and
guards Brian Oliver (21 points) and Kenny
Anderson (20 points), chipped away at the
Panther lead in the second half until Tech
finally tied the score at 81-81 with 6:38 left
to play in the game.

The teams exchanged leads three times.
Then with Georgia Tech leading 91-90,
Oliver fouled Panther guard Jason
Matthews with nine seconds remaining as
Matthews drove toward the basket near
the right baseline.

“I was dissappointed [Oliver] fouled
Matthews on that play,” said Cremins. “I
told him I just wanted him to force
[Matthews] to take a tough shot. If he made
it, then that’s how we’d lose."

 

TUESDAY, DECEMBER5, 1989

Panthers drop heartbreaker in ACC/ Big East challenge

Matthews, who ﬁnished with 119 points,
canned both free throws to set the stage
for Scott’s heroics.

Georgia Tech moved the ball to half
court, then called time out to set up for the
last shot ‘with :06 on the-clock.

“We tried to set up a double screen on
the right side,” said Scott. “I made my
move to the basket, and I fumbled the ball
a little bit.”

Scott regained control, and with :02
remaining fell into the key, with two
Panther draped around him, then banked
in the off—balance game winner.

“It’s a tough one to lose,” said Porter,
who turned in a brilliant performance
with 25 points, 6 rebounds and five assists.
“Hopefully, playing tough games like this
against tough teams will get us prepared

Pitt quarterback Alex Van Pelt was compared to Dan

Marino by the Irish press.

 Bubblin’ in Dublin

Ireland trip positive for teams

By Chris Bosak
Sports Editor

In preparation for a Saturday
college football game, a team
usually practices every day
duringthe week. Every day for
the players, it’s football, football,
football, with very little else on

« their minds.

Last week had to be a little
different for Pitt and Rutgers,
however. It would have been
impossible for the coaches to
keep their players’ minds entirely
on football when they were
5,000 miles away in Ireland
getting ready for the second

Emerald Island Classic.

“[The players] got out and met
the local people, and they
enjoyed it very much," said
Rutgers Coach Dick Anderson.
“That’s one of the things we
encouraged them to do when
they came here. It would be
fruitless to travel across the seas
to another country and lock

them up. We wanted to make
sure they got out. It was a cultural
advantage for them; the only
downside to the whole trip was
that we didn’t win.”

Rutgers’ practice strategy in
Ireland consisted of two light
workouts on Thursday and
Friday. They were idle last
Saturday; therefore, they had an
extra week to prepare for the
game in the states.

“Preparation was a lot
different,” said Rutgers safety
Darrin Czellecz. “We didn’t hit
with pads in practice [in Ireland].
So we didn’t hit ‘til we got on the
field with Pitt."

Scarlet Knight linebacker, Pat
Udovich, found the time in
Ireland a little distracting but
said it didn’t affect Rutgers at
game time. “Maybe I didn’t think
about the game as much off the
field as I would have, but when
we were on the field everyone
was [thinking] football. I don't
think we were loose in a negative

l/om Pelt lives up to countless comparisons

By Chris Bosak
Sports Editor

The two main sports in Ireland
are fast—paced, simple and have
limited play stop. Hurling is
similar to lacrosse, but players
hit the ball with sticks instead of
catching it. Gaelic football
resembles soccer, but players
can use their hands.

The only American football
the Irish people get to see on
television are the NFL games
broadcast two weeks after the
game is played. So the American
sports hero in a country requiring
action and seeing only NFL

games is obvious: Dan Marino.

Marino has lighted up
Scoreboards like a department
store at Christmas time in his
NFL career. For that reason, the
Irish sports fans love him and
know just about everything
about their hero.

Therefore it was also an
obvious decision on how to
promote the second annual
Emerald Island Classic between
Rutgers and Pitt; plug the new
Pitt quarterback. During the
week prior to Pitt's 46-29 victory
the media in Ireland made
countless comparisons between
Marino and Alex Van Pelt. Even

the announcer for the game
continually mentioned Marino
and Van Pelt in the same breath.

Van Pelt didn’t let the press
and the comparisons get to him,
however, and gave the Pitt
offense most of the credit for his
success.

“There was no extra pressure
[being compared to Marino]; it’s
just a compliment to our offense
as a whole, ” said Van Pelt. “When
you have pass protection like
that all year, and you have guys
like Curvin [Richards] and Adam
[Walker] and Ronald Redmon
and our receivers catching the

ball like that, it’s a compliment A

to them.”

Van Pelt didn’t let the action-
awaiting Irish fans down. He
completed 15 of 25 passes for
336 yards and two touchdowns.
He completed six passes for
gains of 20 or more yards. It was
the third time Van Pelt threw for
over 300 yards this season. No
previous Pitt freshman ever
threw for 300 yards. But in
typical Van Pelt fashion, he
shrugged the responsibility of
his success over to the players
around him. “It was the pass
protection. Any time you have
time to sit back there and have
no pressure in your face, it’s

way [in Ireland].”

Pitt didn’t have that extra week
to prepare and was coming off a
tough, last-rninute loss to rival
Penn State.

“We kept talking about focus.
We had to get focused right
away," said Pitt Coach Mike
Gottfried.

To get that focus and forget
the loss, Pitt practiced in the
states on Sunday, Monday and
Tuesday after the PSU game.
They traveled on Wednesday
and practiced in Dublin on
Thurday and Friday. Gottfried
also gave his players some time
to spend with the Irish people.

“It shows that we have a lot of
character to come to Ireland
with all the distractions and play
the way we did. On the plane
ride over, the Penn State game
was forgotten,” said Siragusa.
“The leniency that we got
loosened the players up.

“The [Irish] people treated us

See Ireland, page 10

to Marino

nice. You can just step up in the
pocket and pick out a receiver.”

With Van Pelt’s 336 yards on
Saturday, he moved into second
place on Pitt's all-time single-
season passing leader list with
2,527 yards. Marino’s 2,876 yards
passing in 1981 tops the list.

With the numbers so close
and comparisons being made
already, one might believe Van
Pelt is modeling his collegiate
career after Marino's.
Impossible.

“I've never seen him play in
college. That was before my
time watching Pitt football,” said
Van Pelt.

Utterplozces big/9 in Vegas Invite

By Geoff Moskowitz
Staff Writer

While the rest of us were
bearing negative double-digit
wind chill factors, the Pitt
wrestling team was competing in
the sunny 70-degree Las Vegas

Invitational last weekend. The-

Panthers finished 24th out of a
46-team field.

Alan Utter was the highlight of
the Panther squad. Utter finished
eighth at 142 pounds. To put this
in perspective, 340 people
wrestled in the tournament,
including several national
champions from last season. To
even place in Las Vegas, it was
necessary to win a minimum of
three or four matches.

Stottlemyer said, “Utter had a
good showing. In his final match,
Utter closed the gap on Eric
Wilson (Oklahoma State) who
pinned him previously this
season.” Utter lost the match 9-4.

 

Other Pitt wrestlers who did a
good job, according to
Stottlemyer, were Sean Mofﬁt
(126) and Steve Budman (134).
Moffit won three matches.
Budman, who also won a couple
of matches, lost 4-3 to Andy
McNaughton of Arizona State.
McNaughton ended up, in the
finals.

Stottlemyer said, “Bobby
Simpson [1 18] also looked good,
but kind of faded out towards
the end. From 150 [pounds] on
up we're pretty young. Hopefully
Iwe’veI learned some lessons
and we’ll go back to the drawing
board.”

The Panthers have the rest of
the month off, and will open
their home season against Boise
State onjan. 6 at Fitzgerald Field
House.

Stottlemyer said, “We’re going

to use the rest of the month to
practice technique. It’s possible
we may wrestle at the Midlands
Championships in Chicago at the
end of the month. Boise State
finished very close to us in Las
Vegas, and should give us a good
match. Even though there’s a lot
of time off, we don’t have much
practice time between now and
Boise State.”

Commenting on how Pitt stacks
up in the Eastern Wrestling
League, Stottlemyer said, “West
Virginia has the experience, and
Penn State has the talent.
Everyone else is reloading, and if
they're behind, it's not very far.
Edinboro is also very tough this
yean”

All things considered, Pitt fared
well in Las Vegas. Besides, things
could have been worse; the
Panthers could have wrestled in
inclement Pittsburgh.

V-ballers conclude year
at Alabama tournament

By Scott Campbell
Staff Writer

The Lady Panther volleyball
team finished its season by
going 3-1 in the Women’s
Invitational Volleyball Classic
at Birmingham, Ala., last
weekend. Pitt beat Alabama-
Birmingham (3-0), Iowa State
(34)) and Texas Tech (3-1)
before losing to eventual
champion Wisconsin (0-3) in
the semi-finals.

The WIVC, the National
Invitational Tournament (NIT)

, of volleyball, consisted of four

pools of four teams. Each team
played the others in their pool
with the winner going to the
semifinals.

The Lady Panthers were
seeded first in their pool and
second overall.

“It was a real competitive
tournament,” said Pitt Coach
Sue Woodstra. “Georgia was
ranked first overall, and they
didn’t make it out of their
pool. We wanted to end the
season on a high note, and I
think we did that." Pitt ended
the season at 32-10.

Pitt had no trouble with

-UAB or Iowa State but
stumbled a little when they

came to Texas Tech.

“It's difficult to play three
matches in one day,” Woodstra
said. “We were getting tired.”

The Red Raiders stayed close
in the first two games, but Pitt
came away with wins in both,
15-12 and 19-17. Tech took
the third game, 15-7, before
bowing out in the last game 4-
15 to the recharged Lady
Panthers. Julie Sheils led Pitt
with 12 kills against the Red
Raiders. A

Wisconsin closed out Pitt’s
season the next day, beating
the Lady Panthers 15-6, 15-12,
15-6. ‘

“They played with great
consistency — they're a good
team," Woodstra said. “They
play a tough Big-10
[Conference] schedule, so they
were ready."

Lady Panther Notes: Pitt’s
Jen_elle Lantagne and Dee
MacAuley made the 12-

member All-Toumament team. _

“When we needed a push,
}e_ne1le ‘would make a great
play to get us right back up
there,” Woodstra said, “and
Dee was so consistent, it's
amazing. At the net she did a
great job, and she was real
strong in the back row too,
which is unusual for a middle
blocker.”

Men‘s swim

team Wins

their own
Invitational

By Adam Kamras
Staff Writer

The Pitt men's swim and
diving team won 15 of 20
events en route to winning
the fourth annual Pitt
Invitational this past weekend
at Trees Pool.

7 “The team unity and
performance was the best I’ve
ever seen,” said Coach Dick
Bradshaw.

Mike Kozlina led the team
with seven victories, winning
the 100- and 200-yard
backstroke events and the 200
freestyle. He was also a
member of four victorious
relay teams: the 200 and 800
freestyle and the 200 and 400
medleys. His time of 1:33.70
in the 200 medley with Eric
Cornell, Matt Weist and Tim
Adams broke a pool record.

Of the many Panthers who
did well, Bradshaw was
extremely pleased with Matt
Weist. “IHe] had a great meet,”
he said. “His time of 2:04 [.92]
in the 200 breast was

Lady Panthers stay unbeaten with win over VCU

By Sean Hellman
Staff Writer

The Pitt Lady Panther basketball
team moved to a 3-0 record with
an 82-63 win over Virginia
(3-2) at
Fitzgerald Field House on Sunday.

The Lady Panthers were
looking to play tight defense
against a team with good outside
shooters. Head coach Kirk Bruce
felt his team did a fairly good job
against the Lady Rams.

“The defensive effort was
good,” said Bruce. “I didn’t think
it was fantastic. [But] I thought
we did a solid job.”

All—American candidate Lorri
Johnson had 24 points and Connie

Swimming

outstanding.” Weist broke a meet
record with that performance.
His victories totaled four as he
also won the 100 breast and was
a member of two winning relay
teams.

“I didn’t expect to do as well,”
said Weist. “My times dropping
this much will only push me
harder for the rest of the season.”

The closest team to Pitt was
Texas A&M, who scored 690
points to Pitt’s 1110. Matt Porter
said, “Texas A&M was tough, but

- we thought it would be a lot

closer than .it was.”

Tim Adams also had four-
victories by winning the’ 50
freestyle and being part of three
winning relay teams. .

John Sharkey and Michael
Naylor finished first and second
in both the one- and three-meter
diving events. “John Sharkey
looked really sharp,” said

‘V Bradshaw. In the one meter, Pitt

took the first five spots.

Bradshaw emphasized the
importance of Pitt’s success in
the swimming events. He knew
Texas A&M would provide the
toughest competition, and they
did not enter any divers, thus
enabling them to have 30 more
swimmers. They still only finished
first in four swimming events.

Dave Schepner, J. Kozlina, Bill
Folger and Cornell each won
two events, while T.J. Erdos and
Eric Mattson had one win apiece
for the Panthers.

Bradshaw said the 200 breast
was a super event for his team,
as they took the first four spots.
Finishing behind Weist Were
teammates Kevin’ McLaughlin,
Mattson and Brian Deiderick
respectively. Weist feels it is very
beneficial for him and his
teammates to be so competitive
in one event.

“We all support each other
and push each other to do better,”
he said.

The only team besides Pitt and
Texas A&M to win an event was
Miami, Oh., winning the 400-
freestyle relay. A total of 515
points earned the team a third-
place finish,

(Check out tomarmws Pitt News
for the women's results.)

Hurt had 13 points and nine
rebounds for Pitt. Freshman guard
Maureen McConnell had six assists
and four steals.

VCU was led by Diane Williams
with 13 points and 12. rebounds,
and Jan Warner with 12 points.

Pitt ran the fast break well,
creating points out of VCU’s
mistakes. VCU committed 19
turnovers in the first half.

The two teams began the game
battling to a 19-15 Panther lead.
Pitt then jumped on the Lady

Rams for a 15-3 scoring run to

take a 34-18 lead.
The Lady Panthers made a

similar run of 16-4 early in the 3

second half to take their biggest
lead of the game, 55-33.

It was Pitt’s defense which
caused the-offensive spurts, giving
the Lady Panthers a 39-29 halftime
lead. The defense continued to
play well through the second
half, causing the Lady Rams to
shoot only 20 percent in that half
(9 for 44) and 29 percent for the
game.

However, Coach Bruce was
not quick to praise the defensive
play after Pitt gave up only 29
points in the first half. He added
that the team will look to improve
on its defensive play. “We just felt
we gave up too many points in
the first half,” Bruce said.

The defense caused VCU point

guard Lorraine Ellison to make

Yaurhedlth coverage should he

He-althAmerica of Pittsburgh - I-‘lve Gateway Center - Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15222 -(412) 553-7300

mistakes and commit five
turnovers early in the first half.

“We always like to put pressure
on the point guard,” said Bruce.

“We pressured [them] to the
point where we made them turn
[the ball] over,” said McConnell.

McConnell said VCU was a
“different type of team” than past
opponents. “They weren't as big.
They were very patient with the
ball, so on defense, we also had
to be patient."

“We played great,” said
Johnson. “We knew we had to
beat this team. We had to bury
them. We just tried to pour it on."

Coach Bruce was able to rest
some key players from injuries

late-in the game. Guard Jennifer
Shingler played in her first game
after recovering from an ankle
injury, but did not start. She said
her ankle is still not 100-percent
better.

Johnson played with her right
knee heavily taped. She said there
is a clicking in the back of her
right leg which occurs once in a
while. But she said it's all right
and she’ll be ready for Penn State
on Wednesday night at the Field
House.

“It’s the biggest game of my
life, right now in the season,” said
Johnson. “I know they're going
to come after me.”

    thCoverage,
No Wonder It's
  Called A Check-Up.

Why does it seem like every time you go for a check-up, you end

up writing a check?
The reason, simply enough, is because your present health
coverage probably doesn’t cover things like routine physicals.
Unless you’re covered by Health/Xmerica. Unlike those other

so-called “health plans,’ ’» we completely cover periodic physicals,
mammograms, routine OB/GYN exams, and pediatric check-ups-
With absolutely no deductibles. And no bills.
After all, what good is a health plan if it doesn’t cover the
services that keep you healthy?
Of course, your doctor has a lot to do with your health.
And your peace of mind. Which is why we let you choose the

HealthAmerica doctor of your choice. And why we're affiliated with
many of the area's leading specialists and hospitals—like Magee-
Womens, Children’s, Monteﬁore, St. Francis, West Penn, St. Margaret,
Forbes, Jefferson, Sewickley Valley, North Hills Passavant,
Westmoreland, and Central Medical. .
So instead of signing your name on another check, sign up with

a new health plan. Ask your employer about HealthAmerica.

Health.

Ireland  

Continued from page 7
real well. You could see that
after the game. They mugged us;
but I think they liked us.”

The “mugging” A came
immediately after the game as
thousands of young Irish fans
stormed the ﬁeld in order to get
autographs an.d souvenirs from
the players. The enthusiasm of
the crowd was well—received by

Panther running back Curvin I

Richards, who had 93 yards
rushing along with 69 yards
receiving and three touchdowns.

“You want to show you’re
something special and get some
‘oohs’ and ‘aahs’. These fans
appreciated us more. It's a
motivation," said Richards.

Pitt quarterback Alex Van. Pelt
also felt the Irish crowd was a
welcome break from the crowds
back home. “Our fans are a little
scary. They boo us and stuff like
that, which is unfortunate. But I

‘think the fans here enjoyed the

game. These fans are better.”

Those fans may get more of an

opportunity to see American
football if the international league
that Tex Schramm is trying to
organize gets underway.
According to Gottfried, the
facilities in Ireland are already
suitable for American football.

“What might have to transpire
[in order] to help that league
would be different locker areas,”
said Gottfried. “Our locker room
here was like a club area that was
broken up. That would be about
the only thing is bigger locker
rooms. Of course I’m talking about

[a] college where they have 70
people on a team. I don't see why
that league couldn’t go. The
people was very receptive. The
crowd was excellent.”

For now, live American football
in Ireland is limited to the yearly
Emerald Island Classic. It was
announced that the classic be
continued next year. Pitt and"
Rutgers were already given the
option to play each other again in
four years.

“I’m hopeful that it will continue
and be a success,” said Anderson.

 

ACC 9

Continued from page 7
for later in the season.” .
Panther Notes: The lack of a
solid bench once again hurt the
Panthers as four players were on
the ﬂoor for 35 minutes or more.
“It seemed their philosophy was
to run the ﬂoor since they knew
we only had six guys and they’d
get tired,” said Evans.

Pitt star forward Brian Shorter 

was held to 10 points due in part
to foul trouble.

Scott, Anderson and Oliver
combined for’83 of Tech’s 93
points.
