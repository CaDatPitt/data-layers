Accuses Governor of Improperly Witholding 50 Million

Benedict maintains Governor Holding BackFunds

By Seth Luboye

Pitt News Staff Writer

State Auditor General Al
tion that Gov. Dick Thornburgh is
improperly withholding $50 million
that could be used to relieve the
state-aided universities currently in
an appropriations crisis.

Benedict said earlier this~August
that nearly $555 million from the
previous ﬁscal year ending June 30
was being held as “encumbrances,”
or money used to fund unpaid bills
from that fiscal year.

Citing figures from the past four
years, Benedict said an average
about 10 percent of the encum-
brances are eventually returned to
the treasury.

‘‘I’m saying that as the chief

fiscal officer of this commonwealth
and on statistical information
which we have garnered and glean-
ed over a periodof four of the most
recent fiscal years, we see a pattern
here which has continued to
develop and which has signiﬁcantly
increased,” Benedict said in an in-
terview.

' The Appropriations

Crisis

‘‘It’s a way a governor can deny
the fact that he has these revenues
which could be utilized for what I
consider one of the basic principles
of government and that is to pro-
vide quality education at the best

’ SGB Debates
Major Concert Funds

By MARY KANE
Pitt News Staff Writer

Should the Student Government
Board (SGB) fund major concerts
of all governance groups, or only
those who traditionally hold suc-

cessful ones?

This question came up at Friday’s _

SGB meeting, when the Black Ac-
tion Society madean emergency re-
quest for funding of a Gil Scott
Heron concert, to be held during
Black Week.

“Our initial recommendation is
not to fund it,” said Allocations

. Chairman Colleen Clarke.

However, SGB President Bill
Abraham explained that the Pitt
Program Council, which helped
fund concerts of student organiza-
tions in the past, now has its own

‘E major concert series, and has set a

I

policy of not funding other
organization’s concerts.

The allocations committee, after
meeting again with the BAS, revers-

_ ed its decision and recommended

Peace Corps Volunteers Work With TheirHearts And Hands

By JANE HOLAHAN
Pitt News Staff Writer

So you thought the Peace Corps
was dead, that it had gone the way
of campus unrest and other events
of the l960’s. Well, the Peace
Corps is alive and thriving, thank
you, and ready for the 1980’s.

Established in 1961 during the
Kennedy administration when hope
and idealism were at their height,

the Peace Corps appealed to many _

Americans who saw it as a way to
help and make a real and lasting
change in the world.

Now, in 1980, emphasis is still on
idealism and the desire to help peo-
ple, but other benefits appeal to the
career—minded students of the
l980’s.

“All things being equal,
employer would hire a Peace Corps

an

funding and the SGB approved the
funding.

Abraham said the BAS situation
brought up the question of whether
student government should fund

‘concerts of any student organi_za- «

t,ions,since these organizations, will ,

not be able to receive funding from

the PP.C.
Abraham added that he believed

I funding should be based on prece-

dent, and that only Black Week and
Greek Week haveiheld major suc-
cessful concerts in the past. '

“I don’t think we should single
out only two governance groups,”
board member Bernie Palowitch
said.

“The BAS.and the Greeks singl-
ed themselves out by holding suc-
cessful concerts,” Abraham
replied. ' A

“This limits ingenuity by the
other governance groups,”
Palowitch said. “The door should
be open.” ,

Union. today through Wednesday,

A from 9:00 to 5:00.

“There is also excellent language
training—that is one of the real
benefits career-wise,” said Me-
Carin.

Peace Corps volunteers also have
a competitive advantage in civil ser-
vice jobs, according to McCann. By
law anyone interested in being hired

by the civil service must take a civil-

service exam, but the Peace,Corps
volunteer can take it pass/fail,
while others cannot. The Peace
Corps volunteer can also be hired

even if his score falls below some-

one who was not in the Peace
Corps. Normally the highest scorer

must legally be hired.

possible price so that moreyoung
people have access to educational
institutions that truely desire to use
those institutions.”

Thornburgh has until Oct.l to

make the final decision on a 10 per- '

cent across the board slash in state
appropriations for Pitt, Penn State,
Lincoln, Temple and the other
state-aided institutions. The possi-
ble slash, or “abatement” of ap-
propriations was brought upon by a
$33 million shortfall in the state’s

1980-81 budget.

‘ According to statistics from the
Auditor General’s office, "the
money ‘lapsed,” or encumbrances
which go unspent and are returned
to the treasury, averages out to
about 10 percent of the encumbered
funds for the past four fiscal years
since 1977.

In 1977, $294 million was en-
cumbered and $26 million was laps-

ed or 8.8 percent. In 1978, encum- - .

brances went down to $264 million,
but the lapse money which went in-
to the following year’s budget
jumped to $34 million, or 13 per-
cent. In 1979, $240 million was en-
cumbered, $26 million was lapsed
for a percentage of 11 percent of the
total encumbrances. And in 1980,
$334 million was encumbered from
general and motor license funds and
$32 million was lapsed for about 10
percent.‘

This year, the governor has en-
cumbered’ $390 million from the

‘general fund and $164 million form

the motor license fund for a total of
$554 million in encumbrances, or
21 ‘/2 percent of the total amount of

expenditures for the past fiscal’
year.

_ In 1977, the amount of encum-
brances__ was only 14 percent accor-
ding to the statistics. from the
Auditor General’s office.

“There is a deceptive pattern be-
ing realized here both in the amount
of the encumbrances and the
percentage against total expen-
ditures,” Benedict said, referring to
an unrealistic inflation rate that
would be blamed by the governor's
office for the amount of enbrances’
to jump from $377 million in 1980
to $554 million in the current fiscal
year.

“You can see that it’s a method
of subterfuge by which a governor
has expediently for his purposes

squirreled this money away to make

2 Peace Corps:
Revisited

“The Peace Corps has been con-
sidered an alternative to military
service,” said McCann. During the
Vietnam War, as long as you were
in the Peace Corps, you could not
be drafted.

“The climate in the 60’s was

.totally different,” he said. “The

Peace Corps was big;” At its
height, in the late 60’s, there were
approximately 15,000 volunteers,
but today the number is down to
7,009. ’

This does not mean the Peace

Peace Corps serves in have chang-
ed.

“Ideally,” said McCann, “the
Peace Corps should work its way
out of the country.” Once a volun-

' teer has visited a country, he or she '

leaves behind knowledge A that
hopefully will make that job un-
necessary in the future.

A Peace Corps volunteer does
not- have to be a college graduate,
but advanced technical ' skills are
usually necessary. Volunteers
should be able to speak the
language of the country, and have
some skill which will help the com-
munity he or she will be working in.

Jobs vary from teaching English
to helping begin business

, cooperatives.

Brian Nerrie had a degree in

ing Filipino fish farmers improve
their yield.

Ned Strong received his B.A_.
from the Wharton school. He
organized a fishing cooperative in
Puerto Viejo in the Dominican

"Republic and helped the fishermen

develop an accounting system for
the co-op and expand the market
for fish to other villages. 0

But the Peace Corps volunteer
does more than the job assigned.
McCann was a volunteer in Samoa
for two years before becoming a
recruiter. McCann taught English,
and also got involved with building
a school library and a vegetable
garden. '

don’t have enough money for
higher education,” Benedict
asserted. ,

Emphasizing that he is making
the accusations on a non-partisan
level, Benedict said he is making
them as “a person who believes that
if the money is there, that it should
be used for these purposes. . .and
not just to make Dick Thornburgh

  SGB Discu

“If the door is open,” board
member Martin Bertocchi
countered,” then when another
group comes for funding, the only
reason we have for not funding
them is that its against precedent.
Can we afford to fund the others?
Ultimately, we have to say no.”

“Every group should have the
opportunity to come and. request
funding,” Palowitch said. . “We
should say no or yes to them all.”

Abraham said if too many groups
request funding, the SGB will be
unable to fund them.

Abraham then made a motion
“to set a policy that the only two
groups. the SGB will consider for
funding major concerts will be
Greek Week and Black Week, bas-
ed on precedent. The motion was
rejected, and Abraham said the
SGB would discuss the matter at a
later planning session.

Another matter concerning the
allocations committee was brought
up by student government advisor
Terry Milani. '

responsibility-it’s right now.”

Benedict cited political motives as
the primary cause of Thornburgh
improperly reserving the $50
million, and as the effect of a more
‘ ‘conservative society. ’ ’

‘‘It seems to me that there’s a
consistent encroachment (of our
rights) predicted on what everybody
wants to hear. Cut our taxes, we’re
paying too much taxes; money is
being wasted on this and that.

“I’ve fought welfare fraud, I’ve
fought waste and mismanagement,
but you've got to set your priorities.
We’re not against welfare; we’re
against welfare fraud. We’re not
against reasonable contributions to
higher education-we’re against
abuse, fraud, or mismanagement of

sses New Food Service,

Milani asked the board to con-
sider postponing appointment of
allocation committee members until
November.

Milani explained that when a new
SGB takes office in January, they
will be working with allocations
people who were appointed by and
operated under the previous board,
but these members now have to
work with a new board. ’

“It’s important to have the new
board play a role in appointments
to the allocations committee,”
Milani said.“ ' .

Clarke indicated that the alloca-
tions committee decided their term
would start October 1, with certain
stipulations.

Clarke said the committee wants
members from the past term to

those funds,” Benedict said.
Although ' Benedict is
acknowledging that the governor is
improperly reserving the funds
now, the Auditor General explained
that the solution to the problems
should be more long-term and
through appropriate legislation.
“My suggestion is not as much to
the governor as it is to the members

of the General Assembly,’’_

review the allocations process with
them. " .

“‘The committee feels it’s not fair
to throw new allocations members
right into budget hearings,” Clarke
said. Abraham said there was
basically a consensus among SGB
members to go ahead with an Oc-
tober term-.

In other business, food service
committee laisions Al Mele and Joe
Blazer commented on the perfor-
mance of the new food service.

“We’re pleased with the set-up,”,
Mele said. “But we have gotten
many complaints, mainly about the
length of the lines.”

Mele said complaints about the
old food service dealt mainly with
foreign objects in the food, and
complaints about the new one deal

Benedict maintained.

“I think they should implement a
new area in the fiscal code that
would put reasonable restraints and
restrictions upon the power of the
governor and his secretary of the
budget in the manipulation of tens
of millions of dollars of general and
motor license funds money.

“The fiscal code was im-

plemented in 1929. A hell of a lot of ~

things have changed in government
over the last 51 years and we really
haven’t kept pace with the degree of
sophistication (of government).

“I’m ‘not saying anybody is
breaking a law here. I’m saying that
the law does not define the true
restrictive perimeters that a gover-
nor should have in this area.

abusing a system that has not ad-

dressed itself to the revenue and ex-

penditure of billions of dollars in

“There’s a student co-ordinator
to see to it that the line moves casi-
ly,” Blazer added, “But there’s still
a lot of bottlenecks.”

In ‘addition to the food service,
the future of the student-run food
co-op was discussed at the meeting.

Bertiocchi indicated that student
union renovation plans have no
provisions for space for the food
co-op. However, Bertocchi said a
mall covering may be built from the
Litchfield Towers to a main en-
trance in the Student Union.

“This would be a good place for
the co-op,” Bertocchi said. He sug-

  Fina|ly—A New

Student Union

In the beginning, there was Schenley Hall, the
somewhat dilapidated edifice that Pitt Students have

affectionately come to know as their student union. ‘

Ah, but alas, plans werein the works to bring a

cure to this dilapidation, by way of massive renova-

tions that were to include such lavish additions as
overnight accommodations for commuters, a
nightclub for students and racquetball courts, to
name only a small part of this projected ex-
travagance._ . .
That was last year’s version of the long awaited

student union renovation project, a plan that has

been revised, re-presented and promised to Pitt

' students each and every year over the past 12‘ years.

But now, just when students had begun to accept
the grim reality of their dingy surroundings, the ad-
ministration has gone and said that this yeara slight-
ly different version of the Schenley renovations will
begin.

“We’ve had a lot of fits and starts in developing

the plans. that caused understandable skepticism
among students, but now we have a realistic program
to serve long term needs,” said Jack Freeman, senior
vice-chancellor for administration.

Freeman, along with Vice Chancellor for Student
Affairs Conney Kimbo and Director of Student Ac-
tivities Andy Smith staged a news conference for the
campus media last Thursday to unveil the proposed
renovation.

Undoubtedly, Freeman, Kimbo’ and Smith could
sense the feeling of disbelief among the general stu-

- dent body that renovations would ever actually oc-

cur.
Time and time again students were presented with
opportunities for input into the plans and discussion
as to_ what mode of funding would be the most feasi-
ble to absorb the costs of the reconstruction. .But
discussion does not repair the peeling paint on the
walls of the student union lobby nor does discussion
bring a suitable place for Pitt’s commuter to rest and
study between classes. Only action can do that.
Although we" may be-going out on a limb, The Pitt
News would like to congratulate Freeman, Kimbo,
Smith and all the others who played even a minor
role in finally bringing the student union renovations
project to pass. For the time being we offer these

congratulations cautiously, saving the wholehearted
applause for the time when the first wall is knocked
down and the first coat of paint is applied to the
withering walls of Schenley Hall. We hope these con-
gratulations are not premature.

But according to Freeman and his colleagues, bids

A will be accepted beginning April 1 and construction

should begin shortly after on the $10 - 11 million
dollar project that three classes of Pitt student have
anxiously awaited. .

Along with the detailed discussion of the project
-itself, Freeman announced that a student union fee
(to be assessed every student) would partially fund
the project. This fee however, would not be initiated
until after thebuilding is completed and in use by
students. Again, this move toward a fair and
equitable mode of funding by the administration is to
be commended.

The renovation plans are miraculously well-

I planned and detailed calling for new entrances to

alleviate congestion in the lobby and elevator areas,
notto mention a reassignment of office space to bet-
ter accommodate student organizations.

The announcement last Thursday by Freeman,
Kimbo and Smith cast a new light on the future of
student life at Pitt, a light that we hope won’t be dim-
med by more stalled or otherwise broken promises.

  11» new Publications and Media Board

By NICK ARNETT

The Student Publications and
Media Board Constitution, target
of studentcriticism in the spring, is

- now in effect. The document was

revised several times after members
of student media objected to
various provisions. Over the sum-

-t mer, a lawyer for the administration

made several minor changes and the

' document wo.n final approval by

Conney Kimbo, vice chancellor for
student affairs, ‘in early August, ‘ac-

, cording to Student Activities Direc-

tor‘ Andy Smith. Formation of the
Board was delayed. until now to
allow students to take part, Smith
said. '

“Our initial intention had been to
set up the Board by October,” he
said. “I think we’ll be able to meet
that.”

7 The nine-member Board will con-

:. ‘sist of four studentsand five non-
students. The chief executive of- _
. » ficers of the four student media will
. select two of the members and will

advise the vice-chancellor for
students affairs on his selection of
non-student members. The non-
students will be media profes-
sionals. The other two student
members will be appointed by the

I I Student Government Board, and
~ the remaining, non-student will be

the Media Adviser employed by the
administration. Larry Lunsford
now holds that position. '

“.1 would have preferred a stu-

. ~ dent majoritv Board,” Smith said, _
  \' ﬂlzjections to the proposed Con- I

. an!

stitution had centered on the power
of the Board to act as publisher

with editorial control of student '

media. Smith responded that the
Constitution allows -the Board to
“approve the Statements of Pur-
pose, Constitutions, Bylaws, and
editorial and advertising policies of
all recognized student media and"
publications.”

Article III, Section 1 of the Con-
stitution states, “The Board “shall
be delegated the authority to serve
as publisher of the recognized stu-
dent publications and media, and
will be charged with the encumbent
responsibilities and will hold. the re-
quisite authority.”

“We are not the publisher of The

Pitt News,” Smith said. “The
Pittsburgh Press and the Post-
Gazette have publishers. If they
don’t like what your write, they’ll
fire [you]. That’s not the position
of theuniversity.”

In “The Campus Press—Free-
dom and Responsibiltiy,” Duscha

. and Fisher wrote, “. . .it is fairly

well established that a.college or
university_ is’ not legallv_ the
‘publisher’ of the student publica-
tions which it sponsors, and may
not censor or otherwise unduly in-
fluence. the contents of those
publications, directly or indirectly,
insofar as they ~ are not legally
libelous or obscene and do not

threaten disruption of the universi-
ty’,s educational mission.” They
wrote that the courts have decided
that the university can inﬂuence
size, distribution, quality, or ex-
istence of student media, but not

_ their contents.

Smith—“It is not the intention of
the university, the administration,
‘ or the Board of Trustees to impact
on the content of The Pitt’News.
The Constitution of the United
States makes clear statements on
freedom of the press. Court cases
have made it clear what can and
can’t be done.”

Duscha and Fisher—-“The courts
are not willing to recognize the

Pregnancy ‘Counseling’ Questioned‘

To the Editor:

I am continually interested in the
types of advertisements the Pitt
News accepts for publication. Every -
issue seems to contain from one to
three abortion service notices from
such businesses as Women's Health
Services, Inc. and Allegheny
Women's Center.

Recently, I noticed these ads con-
tained offers for women to “learn
how your body works and take care
of it” as well as the service of
“pregnancy counseling.” My
curiosity had peaked and I decided
to be inquisitive and find out exact-
ly how valid these statements were.

I called one of the above. clinics and .-

P spoke at some length to one of the

counselors. I was nothing short of

shocked to learn’ that she was not A

knowledgeable in the area of
biological fetal development. I kept
telling myself that I was speaking
with a pregnancy counselor, but her
hesitant, unwilling agreement to
embryonic‘ facts I had obtained
from one term of Bio. ll made it
hard to believe. She tried to gain
some credibility by saying that
women- who go for abortions are
not given “biology lessons” before
the procedure, but that only served
to make me question what such pa-
tients are told._ It is a biological fact
that at eight weeks into develop-

ment, an unborn __child- possesses:-all _

of his major body systems. One
woman I spoke with said that at this
age, there was “not really much to
the child.”

These experiences lead me to
believe that we are supporting
misleading advertising. If women
want to learn about how the human
body works during pregnancy,
these clinics are certainly not the
places from which to seek informa-
tion. Moreover, what is becoming
increasingly evident is the clouding
of the abortion issue itself. Isn't it
time for all of us to own up and
take a hard look_ at what those
biological facts are saying? ‘

school as owner-publisher of the
student newspaper and thereby give
it editorial control over its
contents.”

Regarding publications boards of
the type Pitt’s administration has
established, they wrote,
publishing and financing arrange-
ment is the one found on most cam-
puses, and its vagueness has been

' the cause of so many of the pro-

blems involving the campus press
and administrators over the last few
years.”

Smith—“If there resides in peo- I

ple an inherent perception that
anything the administration might
propose smacks of over-control and
manipulation, there will always be
people who could find reason to
find it vague.” Asked if a Board
established by the administration,
with a majority of its members ap-
pointed by the administration, can
be objective, Smith replied: “Ab-
solutely. I don’t have any doubt
whatsoever. The checks and
balances on the administration and
the checks and balances on the
students are very good.” .

Smith said the Board will be
reviewed. .

“The Constitution and the Board
itself will be evaluated. We have no
intention to abridge the freedom of
the press of The Pitt News.”

regarding administrative inﬂuence

By JEFF DUROSKO
Pitt News Sports Editor

‘‘It wasn’t very pretty, but a win
is a win.”

So said head coach Jackie Sherrill
following Pitt’s 14-6 opening game
victory over Boston College Satur-
day. Fans who were looking for an
all-out offensive display by the Pan-
thers were disappointed to see
quarterback Dan Marino throw ﬁve
interceptions and the Pitt offense
fumble seven times, losing four.

When asked if he was disap-
pointed with his offense, Sherrill
said, “No question about that.
When you makeas many mistakes

as we did and get a whipping on the

line like we did, you have ‘to be
disappointed. ’ ’

Apparently, Sherrill didn’t wish
to test that line right away as he
elected to kick off when Pitt won
the toss.

On the third play of the game,
BC’s Shelby Gamble took the hand-
off up the middle and fumbled.
Pitt’s Sal Sunseri jumped on the
ball, giving Pitt a first-and-10 at the
Eagles’ 26-yard line.

After moving to the Boston Col-
lge 18, Marino faked a pass, was hit

e_ and fumbled the ball, which was

recovered by BC.

-The rest of the first period went
pretty much the same as the only
scoring threat was  John

' Cooper miss on a 45-yard"ﬁeld goal

attempt.

In the second quarter, Pitt
mounted a signiﬁcant drive when
the Panthers moved from deep in
their own territory down to the
Boston College 32 on the running of
Randy McMillan and three straight
passes completed by Marino. How-
ever, Marino passed long into the
right corner of the end zone, the
pass intended for Larry Sims. BC’s
Mike Mayok, who was selected as
ABC's defensive player of the
game, intercepted the pass to halt
the Pitt drive. ,

The Eagles couldn’t do anything

  Panther

By ANNA ARLOTTA

In a well-played overtime effort,
the Pitt soccer team recorded its
first win of the young season. The
Panthers outpowered nearby Kent
State 2-0 as they scored a goal in
each of the two ten-minute overtime
periods. Finished by sophomore
Eric Tiedtke in the first period and
Troy Norton in the second gave Pitt
the victory in the see-saw match.

Prior to Tiedtke’s goal, which

was put in the nets 48 seconds into ‘

the overtime period, both teams
had seen a scoreless game in regula-
tion time. The ball had switched
feet (soccer’s parallel to the tradi-
tional hands) a number of times,
with neither team taking total con-
trol for an extended period of time.
Both the Panthers and the Golden
Flashes tallied three shots on goal in
the first half, none of these being
successful.‘

The second half of play was quite
similar to the first except the Pan-
thers took somewhat more control
than in the previous minutes. Pitt
outshot the Golden Flashes eight to
six this half but still there were no
goals to be put on the scoreboard.

But then magic seemed to come
upon the Panthers after the over-
time period got underway. Passing
began to. gel together and in less
than one minute, Tiedtke had suc-

cessfully placed the ball in the net to

On the .first play of the drive,

score took place when Tiedtke
received a ball from the other wing
sophomore John Pizzella. Pizzella
shot the ball that deﬂected off the
crossbar before Tiedtke took con-

trol and accurately placed it past the

Kent State goalkeeper.
Shortly after that, freshman
sweeperback Don Bowen was

. awarded for his fine defensive play

with a yellow card from the referee.

game too defensively and was

By The Associated Press

BALTIMORE¢Terry Bradshaw
tossed a 24-yard touchdown pass to
Jim Smith early in the fourth
quarter to give Pittsburgh the lead
and the Steelers hung on to defeat
the Baltimore Colts 20-17 yesterday
as Donnie Shell intercepted a pass
with 3:30 remaining.

Baltimore, 1-1, moved to a first
down at the Pittsburgh three before
an incomplete pass from Bert Jones
and a holding penalty against tackle
Wade Griffin shoved the Colts back
to the 13. Shell intercepted on the
next play to seal the hard-earned
victory for the Steelers, now 2-0.

8 The Steelers took a 13-78 halftime

Trempus at stopper, played a fine
game, holding off the Golden
Flashes’ attempts to score. “The
offense played a good game Friday
night,” said Hackworth, “but I
think that the defense played
superb. And I don’t really include
myself in that because I didn’t play
up to par. Before that overtime
period, we didn’t have a total team
effort, but then when we went into
overtime we found something. We
found that we need to win, and in
order to do that, we must put
everything together. The key to
putting everything together against
Kent State on Friday was midfielder

lead on two Eleld goals of 25 and 29

yards by Matt Bahr and a 10-yard
scoring pass from Bradshaw to
Franco Harris. ,

But the Colts went ahead for the
second time,” at 14-13, early in the
third quarter on a. 15-yard TD pass

, from Jones to rookie Ray Butler.

On their next possession, the
Colts were helped by three penalties
as they moved a first down at the
Pittsburgh 5. But three running
plays gained only 3 yards, and
Baltimore had to settle for a

A1 Adelmann; he was the man that
always had the ball, he was the
key.”

Adelmann took one of those balls
in the second overtime periods and
directed it to teammate Troy ‘Nor-
ton. Norton took control of the
ball and placed it perfectly in the
nets to record his first score for the
Panthers. Again, junior goalkeeper
Scott Thunberg saw a fine game in
the nets for Pitt. Thunberg saved a
total of 9 balls against Kent State.
The Panthers’ next opponent will
visit Pitt Stadium on Wednesday
evening from nearby St. Vincent
College. Pitt last played St. Vincent

three years ago and handily dispos-
ed of the team 9-0. The competi-
tion that the new St. Vincent squad
will bring remains to be seen at 7:15
when the Panthers kickoff.

three running plays following a first

lﬁilondlayl‘,-v September 15, 1980—Page 11

Perhaps the most pressing question on campus this
week will be “What is the matter with the Panther of-
fense?” Though Pitt defeated Boston College on
Saturday 14-6, thegame was genuinely disappoint-
. ing. This is the team who was picked number one by
both Sports Illustrated and the New York Times, and
picked third in the AP poll. _

That was probably one of the problems. Preseaso
hype can be a tough thing to handle. The pressure
just seems to mount upon a team relentlessly. The
offensive team may have been suffering from open-
ing day jitters. After all, Pitt starts a sophomore
quarterback who, though he possesses a world of
potential, still has a lot to learn. Pitt has an offensive
line that did not play a game together until the season
opener on Saturday. That line is a good one but it
still has to learn to play together as a team.

It’s a tribute to the Pitt defense that the Panthers
won. The offense committed nine turnovers. They
ranged from a fumble by Marino while scrambling
one that an experienced quarterback doesn’t commit
to an interception that was in and out of the intended
receiver’s hands‘. These type of mistakes must be
eliminated quickly. There is no excuse for them and

   

  PittMust Eliminate Costly Mistakes Soon

Sideines

By MIKE DICHIARA

a “top three” team cannot afford to make them.

There were other mistakes. Having a penalty
called for too many men on the field. Several illegal
procedures were a sign of the lack of timing on the
offensive team. Even a “delay of the game” penalty

was called. These are the kinds of mistakes which kill

teams. They probably cost the Panthers at least three
touchdowns, and that’s a‘ conservative estimate.
Coach Jackie Sherrill said that he wanted to

establish an inside running game, getting away from .

finesse football. Fine, but that adds pressureto the
offensive line, and they didn’t respond. The backs
were continuously getting hit behind the line of
scrimmage so they never had a chance to gain yard-
age. '
Boston College does not have the best defense that
the Panthers face, so it is vitally important thattheir

offense start producing. Pitt has the talent to beat a
team like the Eagles by a wide margin. Sure they
won, but the number three team in the nation has to
win big.

This Pitt Panther team is definitely not overrated.
This team is one of the most talented teams, if not the
most talented team, in the nation. But they have to
prove it offensively. They were fortunate against
Boston College because the Eagles don’t have a
quality offense. Although the Pitt defense per
formed extremely well in limiting the Eagle offense,
having to cover for nine turnovers is an impossible
task against a better team. If the offensive mistakes
of this past Saturday are repeated against the likes of
Florida State, Tennessee, Syracuse, or even Temple,
the season will be even more disappointing than the
Boston College game.

The time is now to get in gear. Pitt will play a

weaker Kansas team and, although the game takes

place in Kansas, Pitt is definitely the superior foot-
ball team. If the Panthers cannot get their act
together offensively, Florida State is coming soon,
and Ron Simmons and company won’t be as accom-
modating as was Boston College.

By SCOT STONE

This weekend the Pitt women’s
volleyball squad trampled over
three teams to win the Cleveland
State Invitational Tournament.

In a best of five final match
against Cleveland State, the Pan-
therettes won three straight with
scores of 15-9, 16-14, and 15-8.

“It was a real nice tournament,”

said coach Shelton Collier. “Our-

tgam played better than I expected
t em to.” »

The close call that was an-
ticipated between Pitt and arch rival

Temple University never materializ-
ed. The Pantherettes walloped
them 15-5 and 15-10 in their open-
ing match on Friday. Collier
characterized that game as “fairly
easy.”

The most intense play occurred in
the finals against Cleveland State.
A combinationof the home crowd

and some questionable officiating,

put the pressure on our Pitt crew.

“But this inspires us,” Collier.

said, and the Pitt squad went on to
sweep the match.. .
Overall, coach Collier is very

team. His goals for them going into

the tournament were: to be the top ._
servers, to develop a quick offen-

sive attack system, and to be more
accurate in their ball control.

“We were successful in all three
categories,” he said.
definitely the best serving team
there.”

Although the Pantherettes played
extremely well as a unit, several
members of the squad racked up
some considerable ‘statistics
throughout the tournament. Maria

Perez dealt out 46 assists; captain,
Linda Stadler, and spiker, Julie
Gaul, completed»l7 kills each, while
Paula Olsen and Ellen Mangus ac-
counted for another 12 each.

Pitt played Kent State on Friday '

and suffered its only loss of the
weekend, forcing them to play the
full three-game match. The scores
were: 15-2, 5-15, and 15-9. The
Pantherettes played Kent State
again in the semi-finals and beat

them 15-10, 15-12, and 15-7, in a «.

best of five series.
This tournament was a “kind of
tuneup,” Collier said. “We are just

beginning, but we have a long way
to go.”

The team is excited with its vic-
tory and is looking forward with
great anticipation to next weekend’s
home stand-the Pitt Invitational.
Among the 20 teams that are
scheduled’ to appear, Pitt will face
the seven or eight topsquads in the
east. After Pitt, the most respected

around when McMillan fumbled at
the Pitt 35.

The Eagles tried a two-point con-
version, but Loughery threw in-
complete out of the end zone.

What ensue on the field was full
of errors as Pitt’s McMillan fumbl-
ed, Loughrey was intercepted and
Marino intercepted. Cooper at-
_ V   . . tempted another field goal from the
;:--._'-*i'-_‘__’f=._:. . : 37, but it fell way short of the

 0 ' '0 uprights.

In the most impressive offensive
play of the game, the Panthers
started from their own 30 and mov-
ed in to score 15 plays later. The
score came on another Marino to
Pryor strike from eight yards out.
Trout’s extra point went wide and
Pitt was on top 14-6.

 ' That drive was filled with third
' . and long plays, which the Panthers
completed.

The first was thrid—and-six situa-
tion when Marino passed for 14
yards to Julius Dawkins. The next‘
was thrid-and-l0 when, under great
pressure, Marino passed to Rooster
Jones who ran for 16 yards to the
BC 34. On third-and-seven from the
10, Hawkins made a great catch of
a sloppy pass to gain the first down
at the three. The next play was the
touchdown pass which ended the
day’s scoring.

“We weren’t reckless,” said

  '  ' Sherrill. “We have to be reckless.
 ' ' We have to control the game like I

  Panthers Stumble
Enroute to win  

think we’re capable of doing.” 3'

One problem that Sherrill
pointed out was at ﬂanker, where
injuries plague the Panthers.
“I have to make a decision about
flanker,” he said. “It really
disrupted us completely.’ ’
_ He said a decision would be made
sometime this week. The punting
game is another area in which Sher-
rill expressed concern. He said he
was impressed by , neither John
Ryan nor Dave Heppler. He said he
would be working Trout at punter
this week. 1.3;,

“I didn’t expect this but if it ha
to happen, I’m glad it happened
now,” said Sherrill. “Last year, we
did well in the first game it gave
everyone a false security. We got a
knot on our head the second game
(North Carolina). In the long run,
this may help us.”

“I don’t think we were overconfi-
dent,” Sherrill added, “but we
started out on the wrong track.”

When asked if Pitt will be on the ..

right track by next week’s game at
Kansas, he said, “We’d better.”

PITT NOTES; Flanker Barry Com-
pton,’who was taken out of the
game in the first quarter, underwent
knee surgery yesterday and will be _

out for at least six weeks. . .Pitt 1’

dominated the statistics with 21 first
downs to B_C’s 10 and 334 total
yards to the Eagles’ 228. . .Atten-
dance for the contest was 44,820.

Benjie Pryor Lifts Panthers to First Victory

By Amin Ghossein
Pitt News Sports Writer

When the Pirates aren’t hitting or .

just not playing well, -they look to
Willie Stargell or Dave Parker to
bring them offgthe ground. The
Steelers, when slumping, look for
their lift from Joe Greene or Lynn
Swann. The Pitt Panthers are no
different. Saturday against a tough
Boston‘College team, the Panthers
needed that special performance
from one of their players to eek out

a 14-6 win. They got it. Benjie
Pryor came through with a clutch
game as he hauled in 10 passes and
accounted for 12 of the team’s 14
points.

The Panthers came into the game
as 24-point favorites but it became
painfully obvious asthe game wore
on that the line would never even
get tested. With nine turnovers, the
Pitt offense never got in gear and it
was Pryor who came in to bail out
the sputtering attack.

The senior from Valley high
school was very enthusiastic about
his performance.

“My birthday was Thursday,” he
said, “and this is the best birthday
present I could have asked for. It’s
been a beautiful day.”

“They were giving us the short
passes. Those eight or 10 yarders
were open. The two touchdowns
were short passes like that.”

“They (Boston College) were
tough and came ready to play. They

hit very hard on defense. I'm feel-
ing it right now.”

Pryor’s performance may have
saved the Boston College game but
is_he expected to do this game in
and game out?

“I hope not,” he said. “I hope I
don’t have to do that again. We
have to establish a running game.
When Mac (Randy McMillan) starts
getting the. ball more we’ll move
better.” '

“On most plays I'm the secon-
dary receiver,” he added, “so when

we start hitting our primaries more

we’ll be alright.”

The road to the national cham-
pionship did not come to an abrupt-
halt but it did go thru a scare as
Boston College played the Panthers
tough and fought them tooth and
nail. On days like Saturday when
nothing seems to be going right it's
good to know that players like Ben-
jie Pryor are on your side.
