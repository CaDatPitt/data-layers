The questions ranged from the alien-
ation of youth to our support of Sai-

The vice-president answered all the
questions in [a lengthy manner. Du-
quesne Duke Editor George Heidekat
said that “we didn’t have time to ask
him about the draft.”.'

The editors appearing were Cheryl

A Student Power

Halpin Hits Issues  

by PAUL ST. JOHN

The second meeting of what is
referred to as Student Power ad-
vocates took place in the Cathedral
lawn Thursday evening. Barry
Halpin stated their basic views to
an enthusiastic crowd of over
three hundred concerned students.

Their basic demand is that stu-
ents have a definite say in policy
making rather than the advisory
capacity they now have. Halpin
also stated that he felt Chancellor

3'' Wesley Posvar was putting things
off and being rather condescend-
ing in hopes that the movement
dies down.

Ken Schueler, president of Stu-
dent Government, cited the recent
firing of dorm counselor Bill Pet-

erson as a recent example of how .

students have nothing to say about
matters that directly concern them
Schueler stated that in the future
the feelings of the students should
not and will not be irrelevant.
Schueler also felt that the Univer-
sity “tends to accent grades
rather than the process of learn-
"ing. Under the present system,
_learning does not take place, con-
...ditioning does; just like in ele-
mentary :schoo'., producing hom-
ogenized individuals . . . . quanti-

NEW DEVELOPMENTS AT
RANDOM

In the wake of Bill Peter-
son’s recent dismissal, Random
House is circulating a petition
requesting support of a move-
ment to rename that dormitory
Peterson Plaza.’ At their next
house meeting, a proposal to
terminate their membership in
Men’s Dorm Council will be

ous interest to black students.

The most important single pro-
blem facing our society today is,
how to achieve social justice and
wipe out "the effects of centuries
of discrimination and prejudice
against the black man in America.
The violence that has swept our
nation’s cities during the past sev-
eral -summers indicates that this
problem‘ has reached crisis pro-«
portions.‘ ‘

Recongnizing this, the Univer-
sity in the past year has been mov-
ing to put its_ own house in order
and to make whatever contribu-
tions it can to the society at large
not only to ease the crisis, but
to strike at its roots.

All perceptive studies of this
problem now identify a single,
central cause——what is called white
racism, or bigotry, much of it hav-
ng had its effect in the past, but
some of it alarmingly active in

He also feels that curfews are
inconsistent with learning and the
interrogation that is received when
late is ridiculous.

There was some comment to
the effect that the Student Pow-
er movement does not want to be
connected with the Student Gov-
ernment at all and would there-
fore, obviously, not want Schueler
to represent them.) »

Joe Kociubes, chairman of the
Cabinet of the College of Arts and
Sciences, pointed out that the
Chancellor’s last statement itself
was made without any student in-
volvement. “The problem is not
voicing our opinion,” said Kociu-
bes, “the problem is that after
listening to us they do what they
want to do anyway.’} Kociubes
also stated that the basic structure
and laws concerning policy making
must be changed before anything
else can be done so that commit-
tees of student. representatives can

After the speakers, the floor
was then turned over to anyone
wishing to speak, at which time
the existence of another student
newspaper was brought up. A]-
ternatives should be out some
time this week. It is designed to
be a student newspaper in which
anything any student has to say
can be published.

ing to overcome or compensate for
the injustices of the past,-can-true
social justice be approached; a ,_
sense of appearance of impartial- $3 .
ity is not tantamount to justice in "
race relations. ' ‘

One member of the black com-
munity says this: “For three hun-
dred years, blacks andwhites have
been playing a ballgame in Am-
erica, and they’ve completed four-;
and-one-half innings. we’ve been
cheating you, but we’re not go-
ing to do that any more. From
now on we’re going to play fiar.’,
The only trouble with this is that
the score is one hundred to noth-'
ing.” ‘ ~

It is imperative that every white
member of the_ University com-
munity understand the extent of the
black man’s grievance lest the very
efforts we made to correct injus-
tices produce resentments that in-
crease the racial tensions we are
trying to reduce. We must strive-
for empathy between white and
black people, here on this cam--
pus, in the classrooms, in our stu-.
dent activities, in the dormitor-.p
ies and in our social contacts.

One example of a “racist” pro-
cedure that we are attempting to
‘correct is in our -admissions sys-
tem._ The policy of this Universi-

ever, the fact is our means of
measuring who is “best” are im-

able circumstances; for the black.

hurdle, since they may be cul-

turally biased and not take into

Then we read in the newspapers that

time understood.

Using attitudes and tones bor-
rowed from Blow-Up, Bunuel has
filmed a life style with uncanny
grace and accuracy. But, unlike
Antonioni’s detached matter-of-
factness, Bunuel directs with an
emotion that is unique among the
new cinema obscurists. Where
Blow—Up calmly observed the pro-
blem of individual responsibility
to one’s community, Bell de Journ
passionately probes the deepest
recesses of the unconsicious.

The film is the story of a young
wife and how she represses her
desires. The beautiful French
girl is Catherine Deneuve and

her handsome husband is played
by Jean Sorel. Together they
seem to have everything: shes
lovely and blonde; he wealthy.
and kind. But because of a
naughty thing that happened to
her when whe was little and her
pysche underdeveloped, the wife
would like her sex a little rougher.

The husband, being gentle, and
kind, of course can’t accommo-
date her so she takes a daytime
job in a brothel and comes to lobe
her position. All this goes on for
quite a while; she on her back be-
hind his, loving it because you get
to meet such interesting people:

So
much so. that. by the ending you
feel as if you've seen three films.
To create such a multiplicity of
meanings. Bunuel makes frequent
use of real and illusory flashbacks.

This technique would not ordin-‘

arily create any problems were it
not for Bell de Journ’s unconven-
tional ending. The last scene
is so full of illusion and ambigui-
ty that the viewer is set free to de-
cide for himself if what he has
seen before was illusion or real-
ity. Thus, Bunuel has created a
film with at least three different
plots all depending upon how one
interprets the final scene.

Never before has a film audi-
ence been asked to supply so
much imagination, to fill in so
many blanks with "so much suc-
cess. It is the rare exception that
proves to be not only the first
but also the best. The skillful man-
ipulation of so complicated a
techniquehas produced a master-
piece. Belle de _iour has set a pre-
cedent that may never be broken.

Hindsight

, The controversy surrounding the last week’s firing of
Bill Peterson brings to light many emotionally filled ques-
tions. But the central question of the entire controversy is
not the moral and personal issues involved in Head Resident
Zabec’s decision; it is not really that Bill Peterson is and re-
mains a respected counselor. The central issue involves stu-
dent rights. And as before, the students in the dormitories
especially those residents in Random House have been treat-

" ed as if they were puppets.

Such treatment has to stop. With all that has been pub-
lished about student rights and student involvement one theme
has not sunk in—students must be allowed to make their own

fice to open their eyes. Maybe its time’ for ous housing ad-

. ministrators to alter their archaic perceptions.

We realize that is is most difficult for people to change
their perceptions. But when students in the dormitories are
the subjects to the typical paternalism that has plagued this
institution for so many years, some fundamental perceptual
changes are drastically needed.

The fate of_ Bill Peterson presents all the students at
this Universityiwith a test case. Students have never been
actively involved in decision making at the University. And
if we are to accept the dictates and attitudes of the Housing
Office, students will never have a chance to decide their

decisions. The Housing Office has failed to take cognizance
, of this fact. Maybe its time for the people in the Housing Of-

Kent Feter was standing at the
bar, and trying to tell his friend
to forget the man they buriedthat
day. Both men were drunk. _

“He’s dead,” said Kent. “So
why don’t you let him be dead.
He was a helluva man . . . . my
firend, but he’s dead. Let him be
dead.”

When men drink, it’s strange

that the truth always comes out.’

This night, it was Kent Feter‘s
turn. .

“Say friend,” he said to me. “I
don’t want to bother you, but could
you give me a ride to my truck
parked up aways. Don’t give me
an excuse if you can’t do it. I

_ don’t want that. Just say no if you
don’t want to.”

Before I said anything, he start-
ed.

“I’m not durnk, you know that

don’t you,” he said, while wast- ‘

ing his third match trying to light

a cigarette; and swaying to and
fro.

“I’ve gotta get home,” he said
and then he started thinking. He
looked straight ahead. His blue
eyes were watering. “I’ve got two‘
kids. I work hard. but . . 

His voice tailed-off in sniffles.

“I’m no dummy. You don’t think
I’m a dummy. Do ya?" he asked.
“My IQ is 151. I’m no dummy. I
was a wise guy. They kicked me

. out of high school.” ,

Then two parasites, Butch and
Kenny, sitting next to him, asked
Kent for a dollar to hnv a few
drinks. “Here take it,” Kent said,
pushing the greenback across the
wet bar. “Want another, here . . 
The one parasite took the second
dollar.

“I know what these guys are,”
he confided in me. “You’re smart,
you know what I mean. The one
poor slob; everyone goes to bed
with his wife. I feel sorry for him.
It’s a shame but what are ya goin
to do . . . .you know?”

Kent is balding slightly in front;
the rest of his hair is gray.

“I’m an archaeologist. I work
with my hands‘. I work hard. You
know, I've been married three
times. I have seven kids. two to
a colored woman. I pay more ali-
mony than you make.”

“I’m only 33 you know that,”

’ he said. The tears rolled to his

eyes. “What’s wrong with me. I’m
no dummy. I can leave anytime
I want. My birthdays in Decem-
ber; I’ll be . . . .34 . . . .yea, 34.”

Drink was getting to him.

“I’m an alcoholic. But I’m no
dummy. Am I? I don’t know why
my truck is over there. I’m just
here. Seven kids and three wives,”
he was stammering and wiping his
eyes.

Kent’s face was pale in the dim-

ly-lit room. The only protection he ‘

had against the outside world was
his thin white teashirt with the red
spot of catsup to one side.

“I’m no dummy . . . . you be-
lieve me don’t you?” his voice
echoed. >

It was truth night for Kent Fe-
ter, and in the crowed room, he
cried all alone.

Schueler Clarifies Piositionl

Editor, The Pitt News

Having never advocated — by
statement or inference— the “over-
throw of the housing office” I find

1 O‘ the .MDC View point of the Pet-

erson Case,” The Pitt News Sept.
13, to be dubious leap in logic. It

" is sufficient to point out that as of
 last Friday, the President of MDC

is at a loss of memory as to what

i " I said specifically or generally at
V Random House to warrant this ac-

cusation.
What concerns me is simply that

» ‘my views of self-government and

local autonomy for dorm students
have been seriously distorted and
misrepresented. Last ,'l‘uesday at

- Random House I spoke out in re-

sponse to these statements by the
President of MDC: “the MDC ex-

' ecutive ‘board upholds the right
.of the housing office to hire and

fire its employees . . . . . there
is nothing we can do . . . . I know
Bill Peterson was one of the best
dorm counselors we had last year
. . . . . but we don’t have all the

.facts.....’’

My reaction to this attitude is
nothing new; I am strongly in

O .favor of more student involve-

ment in the decisions which direc-
ly effect our lives. In the case of
Bill Peterson I argued that al-
though this was an employee-em-
ployer relationship, the Univer-
sity (could not completely) ignore
the feelings—whether positive or
negative—-of those students most
directly effected by the decision
to fire him. Granted, a resident
assistant has both counseling_and
custodial responsibilities. But
could the University take, issue

 
  

th

 

ct. that those‘ in-_  p
3 -- -oh», 

 

evaluate Peterson’s performance
as a counselor were the students
of Random House? Could the of-
ficers of MDC, a representative
unit of resident students, ignore
their role as a vehicle for the ef-
fective expression of the needs
and interests of the dorm stu-
dents, while merely reiterating a
legal definition of the employer’s

right to hire and fire? I took par-

ticular exception to the point of
view that nothing-could be done,
that one should be content with
the proposals for reforming social
rules, that “we don’t have the facts
from which to make a judgment,”

that the feelings of those students
in Random House were not alto-
gether important. I argued that
something could be done, that the
students of Random House had a
natural right to desire and ob-
tain involvement in the decision
to fire their counselor, and that
our condition of ignorance of the
facts was due to the present phil-
osophy under which students are
not involved in a significant and
meaningful form of self-govern-
ment in the dormitories. It is sur-
prising now that the students of
Random House feel somewhat
apathetic toward the coming
term? Doesn’t apathy result when
individuals have very little to say
about the decisions shaping their
life experiences? The decision to

- fire Bill Peterson, whether right

or wrong, was made with very
little regard for the students in

Random House, in terms of solicit-

ing theirviews and feelings be-
fore the decision or of adequate-
ly explaining. the reasons forvfir-,

For years a key student concern has been to ob-

' tain representation in University policy making

groups..Presumably, with this issue in mind, Chan-
cellor Posvar offered his program on University re-
organization. Accordingly, the Pitt News claimed a
“victory.” I f we accept the premise that students
need more representation. the the Pitt News edi-
torial was justified.

It is now time to re—examine this premise. We,
at Pitt, are represented. Student leaders do meet
with key administrators. In many cases, student

, leaders have attained the agreement of the admin-
istration on substantive reforms. Yet, few signifi-
cant changes have come from these meetings. Many
student suggestions have simply come from these
meetings. Many student suggestions have simply

been ignored. This non-act materializes as an effec- ‘

tive pocket veto.

LAST JULY, Chancellor Posvar chaired a meet-
ing of seven administrative leaders, several faculty
members and seven students (including Student
Government President Ken Schueler and myself).
Apparently, Chancellor Posvar wanted to hear a stu-
dent viewpoint. The students united around one sug-
gestion. This proposal entailed student organizations
assuming some decision making power. The admin-

Georgie m A Really Great Man

 

istration would retain a veto which would have to
be exercised publicly. -

This proposal has never been discussed public-

ly by the administration. The only statement the ‘
.Chancellor has made indicates that the decision

making power remains where it has always been—
and we get more representation. »

It is important to note that no student leaders
helped to draw up the Chancellor’s reorganization
proposal. The Chancellor has decided what the new
“representative” agencies are to be. In some cases.
he has even suggested which student representa-
tives should sit on several of the committees. Since
issuing his statement, the Chancellor has made no
request of the Student Government’ President or of
the representatives of the Student Senate for them
to discuss his statement with him (or with the Chan-
cellor’s representatives). Neither the SG President
nor the Senate were sent advanced copies of his
statement.

‘Chancellor Posvar expects his proposal for in-
creased representation to be taken seriously; yet,
there was no meaningful student representation on
this most basic issue——how are we to be represented.

If Chancellor Posvar is sincere in wanting more
student participation in this University, he will
give student organizations more than the lobbying
power we already have. As now constituted the
Chancellor’s proposal keeps all decision making au-
thority where it has always been—and we get more
representation.

  Alienated Students Dem

by BRUCE LEVEN SON
The right to hire and fire employees at this University be-
longs solely to the administration. But when this responsibility
is abused, the student body must speak out.

The student is affected in some way, no matter how large or
small, by the work of all University personnel. This places him

in a position where he is able to
evaluate. with a considerable de-
gree of fairness. the perfor-
mance and competence of an em-
ployee. Therfore. the student has a
right to express an opinion con-
cerning the appointment or dis-
missal of University employees.

If so requested, the student must
be presented with all of the facts,
concerning the hirings and firings
of personnel, in order to form a
valid opinion to express.

A little more than one week ago.
a University employee was irre-
sponsibly dismissed from his job
as the administration attempted to
hide the reasons for this action
a convinced body of students.

Sam Zabec, head resident of
Tower A, fired Bill Peterson (Ran-
dom House resident assistant) with-
out disclosing the reasons of his
dismissal to the incensed students
of that dorm. Subsequently. the
Random residents informed the
rest of the student body of this
action and demanded the release
of this information.

Zabec and Housing Director
David Ginevin refused to dis-
close the facts of the case in the
interest of Peterson. Peterson sta-
ted that he had “nothing to hide." '

At first, Peterson and Random
believed that it was an incident
involving the misuse of an ele-
vator key. an ice machine. and the
Towers cafeteria that sparked the
dismissal. Admitting that an er-
ror had been made. the residents
felt that Peterson’s punishment
was not in just proportion with
the crime committed.

‘ After continued pressure from
the dorm and other students, Za-
bec finally revealed that Peterson
was released for “having a bad

a iu e. a ecs argumen s
based on four premises: that Peter-
son did not wish to attend coun-
selor retreat this past summer, that
Peterson was late in arriving to
the bus leaving for the retreat,
that Peterson failed to attend a
meeting with Zabec and the oth-
er residents assistants, and of
course the ice incident.

The counselor retreat created a’
problem of priorities for Bill Pet-
erson. Peterson was working for
the State Attorney General of Min-
nesota. As a University law stu-
dent, this job was important to
his future. The retreat. held an-
nually, serves to train new resi-
dent assistants and discuss policy.
Since Peterson had been a resi-
dent assistant last year. he did not
need the training. Any vital dis-
cussions or changes in policy could

-have been caught up on at a la-

ter date. After weighing the
choices, Peterson chose to forego

the retreat. Peterson reversed his
decision after being informed by
Zabec that attandance was man-
datory. The Random House coun-
selor attended and participated
actively at the retreat.

Unfortunately. he was late for
the bus leaving for the retreat by
a trivial 26 minutes. Trivia1,‘con-
sidering that he had to break a-
way from his summer employ-
ment, fly halfway across the coun-
try, and pack for the retreat.

A communication gap resulted .
because of Peterson’s absence at
a meeting. The fault lies clear-
ly with Zabec, who while inform-
ing all other counselors of the
meeting, failed to notify Bill Pet-
erson. Is this evidence_of a bad
attitude? If so, whose? '

The ice incident represents an-
other breakdown in communica-
tion. Peterson, and other counsel-
ors, were not aware of this rule.
Should Peterson be held responsi-
ble for Zabec’s lack of communi-
cation with his resident assistants?

Dismissing Zabec’s assertion as
false, it is reasonable to conclude
that Peterson had an exceedingly
good attitude. Bill Peterson will
stand on his impressive record at
Random House: last year’s bowl-
ing champions. Spirit Award win-
ners, and second place finishers
as best living unit. The men of

-Random grew to admire and re-

spect their resident assistant. Out-
going dorm President Eric Erl-
baum asserts that “there is no rea-
son to accept another counselor."

ing for a change of that dorm’s
name to Peterson Plaza. Also up
for consideration at their next
house meeting is a proposal to pull
out of Men’s Dorm Council in
protest of the dismissal of Bill
Peterson.

Men’s Dorm Council President
Nick Gervase calls Peterson, “The
best dorm counselor we had last
year.” Finally, Sam Zabec him-

- self admitted to The Pitt News

that Peterson had a “healthy at-
titude” with the men of Random.

What constitutes a “bad atti-
tude?” We must assume that be-
ing disliked by Sam Zabec is the
requirement for a “bad attitude.”

Bill Peterson was paid to do a
job. His payment came in the form
of room and board. His job was
to see that the necessary forms

were filled out, the necessary ,
rules followed, that interest‘ in

Random House was high, that his
men participated in dormitory and.
University functions, and that in
some major way he was making
their residency at the University
more complete. Peterson, as the
record indicates, fulfilled the re-
quirements of his position ad-
mirably.

The varsity and freshman soccer squads scrimmaged each

;other Saturday and the coaches walked away as confident
j 5 as ever.

Coach Leo Bemis, varsity mentor, said of his team “Natural-

-_ ly we looked better. We should. We’re starting to put it all
',together.” .

He reasoned that his troop’s superiority comes from their experi-

fenc,e, the fact that they have had twice as much practice time, and
‘that they have been going through the strenuous conditioning pro-
-gram that he has set up.

But, thexfreshmen certainly did not disappoint Bemis.
, “They don’t look too bad. As a'freshman group they’ll form a good

 team,” the coach mentions.

The coach of the fresh is Pete Snyder, one of Bemis’ players from

1 last year. Snyder, who has learned a lot from his ex-coach, is also opti-
 mistic after two weeks on the job.

He states, “It’s hard to stand on the sidelines, but we have a good

group, there’s good spirit- here.” Snyder declined to mention names of
 freshmen standouts this early.

“The only individual right now is the individual team. This is

< what we talk about,” he says.

The team has fifteen members, three of who are scholarship play-

; ers. They have had only a week of practice and still have a month-
'_ long wait until their opener.

Bemis thinks that this delay gives Snyder lots of time to work

yiwith the frosh and thinks that Snyder can handle them.

He comments, “I always leave it up to the freshman coach. I’m

 _ sure»Pete’ll bring them along. ”

Snyder thinks he can, too. He’s not going to put all the stress on

 winning because these players are here to get ready for varsity play.

“You always want to win, but we’ll go equal on winning and pre-

 paring for the future,” the young mentor replies.

7 This is why the conditioning isn’t as important in the freshman

2 camp. The real hard work is being concentrated on the fundamental
.skills of the game. Most of the practice time has been taken up by
T drills, trying for closeness to perfection.

-This is what Bemis likes his freshman to do, and it’s what Snyder

.-wants them to do. Then next year those going on to the varsity will
{be able to concentrate on getting into shape without worrying about
 fundamentals.

  2   Where Is

He Now?

Where is he now? Brian Bubnis,

Bubnis, a defensive stickout two
years ago, sat out last season but
was signed as a free agent this past
spring by the Philadelphia Eagles
of the NFL. Brian was cut after
two weeks, but the Eagles placed
him on their Pottstown farm club,
where he has been described by a
team spokesman as a “stellar per-
former.”

The Eagles have suffered sever-
al injuries on the offensive _line,
and Bubnis, a guard, may be back
in the NFL before he knows it.
Also on the Firebird squad is for-

in 3:15,” he reviewed. “I knew that was
too slow for me. They were quicker than
I was. I lost by about a second. If I’d
beaten one more kid . . 

No regrets. No second-guessing. And
all things considered, no wishing he'd en-
tered the 5000 meters. Just the realization
that his 3:54.7 wasn’t quite good enough to
land him into today’s finals. ‘

Instead, Jerry’s back in Pittsburgh and
chalk all that high altitude training up to
experience. Today he’ll take a vacation
from running, but it’s back to cross-coun-
try tomorrow. Afterall, there’s Kent State
and Ohio University to beat Saturday.

And that’s what distance running and
Jerry Richey’s all about. Richey thinks
cross-country’s a lark. It’s enjoyable. So
he runs. Too many other people — and the
Pitt News and its sports editor are just
as guilty as anyone else —- tend to look at
Richey as a pair of legs wearing a Pitt
track suit. And he’s too nice a guy to com-
plain about this treatment.

Rush Attack

The word from the West
Coast is that the UCLA Bruins
in a rebuilding stage for the
1968 season. With only eight
of 22 starters returning, Coach
Tommy Prothro has his work cut
out for him.

~ With the opening game quick-
ly approaching Saturday even-
ing; Coach Prothro has this to say
about his squad, “I think we have
made progress, but we are further
away from being ready to play than
I can remember a UCLA team be
ing at this point.”

As dreary as that may sound,
there is much optimism around
the Westwood Campus that this
year’s team may prove to be a
real “sleeper.” Much of this opti-
mism is centered around the Bruin
ground game. -Besides the 1-2
punch of halfback Greg Jones and
fullback Rick Purdy, UCLA has
come up with a talented runner
in sophomore, Mickey Cureton.

Cureton, who was one of the
outstanding sophomores mention-
ed in Sports Illustrated along with
the Panthers’ Ralph Cindrich and
Lloyd Weston, is currently run-
ning at the number two spot be-
hind Jones. He also teams with
Jones as the deepmen on the kick-
off and punt return teams.

Prothro has labeled Cureton as a
phonemenal soph. “He not only
is a great runner, but is as good
a blocking back now as we’ve had
at UCLA. with the possible ex-
ception of Mel Farr,” he added.

Prothro’s talented runners may
have some trouble finding holes
to run through, as the Bruins have
lost two veteran guards from a
fairly inexperienced offensive
line. Senior Tony Steponovich’s
knee has not responded from a pre-
season operation and is lost for the
year, as is junior Ron Tretter. who

The Olympics were formed to showcase
and honor outstanding individual achieve-
ments. Only the politicians — from Adolf
Hitler in 1936 to Harry Edwards in 1968
— have spoiled the true competitiveness
of the games by trying to take some of the
individuality out of them.

In that same sense, how many people
around here have thought for the past four
months how many great things Jerry Rich-
ey was doing for Pitt? How few of us have
considered some of the tremendous per-
sonal accomplishments this young man has

Woz Gains First Team  
Status; Looks Forward ,

To “Getting] ob Done” g

by MARTHA HARTEL

John Wozniak is the forgotten man in the trio of super soph
linebackers.

, Wozniak, a 5’11”, 210 pounder from Pittsburgh, hasn’t
received the publicity of fellow sophs Ralph Cindrich and Lloyd

:Veston, but he has received a blue jersey, just like Cindrich and Wes-
on. /’

 

d for the past

  
   

“I don’t think too much about the publicity,” explained Woznial.

“I don’t mind it. I just go out there and try to get my job done.”

So far, Wozniak has done his
job. He was awarded first team
status last week at the middle
linebacker spot. “Technically,
Cindrich and I are both first
stringers at middle linebacker,”
Woz continued, “but right now I'm
actually playing behind Ralph.
But once the season starts, I think"
I'll be playing a good bit.”

At 5’11”, Wozniak is small
when compared to Weston and
Cindrich, but he doesn’t feel his
size is -a disadvantage on the
field. “I used to think about size
alot,”' continued the modest soph-
omore, “but not any more. Once
I get out on the field I don’t
think about it at all. I just get
out there and try to kill some-
body. On the field it’s all abil-
ity, not size.”

But size, or lack of it, does
bring back one memory in par-
ticular for Woz. ._“When I was be-
ing recruited in high school, Penn
State said I was too small to play
college ball. They took me off
their recruit list. I’m really out
for them this year now. I think
they’ll be our toughest oppon-
ent this year, but I’m out to get
them,” explained Wozniak.

With sophs Wozniak, Cindrich
and Weston holding blue jerseys
at linebacker, inexperience could
be a problem, but‘ Woz doesn’t
think so. “What we lack in ex-
perience, we make up in ability,”
he quipped. “There’s an excess of
ability at the spot with Ed Gallin
—Lloyd, Ralph and the rest of
us. I think we’ve got the best
linebacking crew in the nation.”

experienced letterman at center,
the two guards, and the split-tack-
le slot.

Even-with the offensive line be-
ing a big‘ question mark, Protho
still feels that he can continue his
winning ways, which have brought
him a 24-5-2 record and have put
his teams into the national ratings
three years. i _ ‘

JOHN WOZNIAK
Unheralded Linebacker

Wozniak played linebacker
and guard at Baldwin high school
where he was named to the Penn-
sylvania Big 33 squad, All - WPI
AL, and All-Western Conference.
He played linebacker last year as
a freshman, although he was tried
at guard for a while.

“I like to defend against the’

rushing game,” he commented,”
but I like the passing game much
better. I like to get into the secon-
dary and take the cleats off the re-
ceivers.”

The soft-spoken sophomore will
probably get plenty of opportun-
ities to defend’ against the pass
when the Panthers open at UCLA
Saturday night.

for a night out  
with the boys.

COMPREI-IEN’DING—-NOT SKIMMING

Anyone could skim through all those books, but Dennis reads
every word. By using the Reading Dynamics technique, he reads
over 3000 words a minute. At the beginning of last semester, Dennis
decided to read all of his class texts to improve his grades and
to have more leisure time duringthe semester. No. it wasn’t a
"cram” marathon. Dennis still had time for his personal reading
and social life. Even in his law texts, Dennis rarely falls below 1500
words a minute. His comprehension is excellent. The statistics and
details are not overlooked. Dennis Barr learned this amazing read-
ing method at the Reading Dynamics Institute.

READ, STUDY 3, 5 EVEN I0 TIMES FASTER

Most of us read at an average rate of 300 words a minute with only
average comprehension. Most Reading Dynamics Graduates read be-
tween 1000 and 3000 words a minute and many read even faster.
Reading" Dynamics will show you how to read and study 3, 5
even 10 times faster. In fact, if you don’t at least triple your reading
speed with equal or better comprehension, we will refund your
tuition.

OVER 400,000 READING DYNAMICS GRADUATES

Over 350,000 Reading Dynamics Graduates read an average of 4.7
times faster with equal or better comprehension. Evelyn Wood In-
stitutes are located in over 100 cities in the United States and
throughout the world. This is the same rapid reading course first
brought to public attention when the late President Kennedy in-
vited Mrs. Wood to teach his White House staff her amazing
reading discovery.

ATTEND A FREE DEMONSTRATION

This week in Pittsburgh, Butler and Greensburg—Free Demonstrations
of Evelyn Woods Reading Dynamics are being held in many conveni-
ent locations. Be sure and attend. This one hour could change your
entire life. You’ll see an interesting and amazing film about reading
dynamics. Hear Congressmen, Senators, Business Men praise the
rapid reading course that Dr. George Gallup said, “May one day be
taught in our Public School System.
