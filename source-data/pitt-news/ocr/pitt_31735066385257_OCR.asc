The Pitt News Presidential Election Survey

,The Pitt News re-
cently asked a ran-
dom sampling of Pitt
students how they
planned to vote in
the 1988 presidential
election. Students
were also asked
whether or not their
selection was in-
fluenced by the
”negati..ve” charges
made against both
candidates, or by the
campaigning efforts
of either the College
Democrats or the
College Republicans
on the Pitt campus.
The survey was con-
ducted in the Wil-
liam Pitt Union, the
Cathedral of «Learn-
ing and the Litchfield
Towers lobby.

News Editor

Americans have been saturated
for the past few months with cam-
paign propaganda on why and
who to vote for today in the
presidential election.

In one corner, we have George
Bush, the 64-year-old vicepresi—
dent, who has stated that his long
resume in government qualifies
him for the high office.

Across the political ring stands
Michael Dukakis, three-time
governor of Massachusetts. The
55-year-old has said that he
thinks the best days of America
are not behind the country but
are yet to come. a

Throughout the past months,
one focal point the nation has
been drawn to is the negative
publicity generated by both can-
didates via the media. The Ameri-
can public has been smacked in
the face right and left with com-

mercials and statements where
one side criticizes the other.

The campaign mudslinging has
prompted a sour attitude toward
the election by political figures
and private citizens alike.

This, coupled with the com-
plaints that the candidates are
without the charisma and back-
bone and spirit of American
presidents past, has resulted in a
lack of voter registration that
hasn't been seen since the elec-
tion of 1948.

In many instances, the people

of the United States are faced
with the dilemma of deciding
who not to choose, instead of en-
dorsing either Dukakisior Bush
with the confidence that one can
run the country.

Going into today, both parties
claimed their campaigns were
gaining momentum: Bush confi-
dent he has all but sewn up the
election; Dukakis trying to gain
ground and win one from the

Voter registration down

By Michelle L. O'Brien

Staff Writer

Today's voter turnout in Al-
Iegheny County is expected to be
almost 30 percent higher than the
projected national turnout, ac-
cording to the Allegheny County
Bureau of Elections.

Jim Scanlon, bureau director, I
estimated that 80 percent of the
county's 750,302 registered
voters will go to the polls. Elec-

ttion officials nationwide are

projecting a 52 percent turnout,
the lowest’ since 1948.

* The average turnout in Alleghe-
ny County since World War I has

‘been 83 percent, Scanlon said.

The highest county voter tumout
in general elections occurred in
1960 when 88 percent of
registered voters turned out to
help elect John F. Kennedy over
Richard Nixon.

Only 74 percent of county
voters participated inNixon’s re-
election campaign against
George McGovern.

The polls will be open from 7
a.m. to 8 p.m. tonight.

sidekick of the Gipper.

Polls taken Monday show the
Bush-Quayle ticket anywhere
from five to 12 points ahead of
Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen.

ANALYSIS

Dukakis, however, has said he
is not giving up hope, in any
sense of the word.-He, in fact, has
been running on a day—and-night

_schedu|e, claiming that he

doesn't need sleep at this point.

Also, Bush is refusing to let up
on his bid for the presidency, and
that the political tide had moved
in his favor.

That was all before today.

When the polls open, voters
will step in and tip the lever, be

it Democrat or Republican. The

choice will be for any number of
reasons. Maybe they like the fact
that Dukakis could erase the fed-
eral deficit in America as he did
in Massachusetts in the 705. Or
they may find refuge in Bush's
plan to ”continue economic poli-
cies that create jobs.” Perhaps
they feel the vice president is best

representative of their political _

ideologies. Maybe they are
scared of placing the often-
criticized Dan Quayle into the se-
cond highest-office in the land.

In fact, as not seen in recent
presidential elections, the choice
of vice presidential running mate
has been a deciding factor on
both sides.

When the Republicans found I.
Danforth Quayle, they thought
that they had a handsome, clean-
cut senator whose youthful ap-
pearance could bring an air of
freshness to the ticket. This turned

League refuses to endorse candidate

By Betty Sarafin
For The Pitt News

The League of Women Voters
recently withdrew its sponsorship
from final presidential debates,
according to national league
President Nancy M. Neuman.

’’It has become clear to us that
the candidates’ organizations aim
to add debates to their list of

.. campaign-trail charades devoid

of substance, spontaneity and
honest answers to thorough ques-
tions. The league has no intention
of becoming an accessory to the
hoodwinking of‘ the American
public,” said Neuman.

The campaigns presented their
agreement to the league on Sept.
28, with 16 pages of conditions
not subject to negotiation. The
league strongly objected to con-
ditions in the agreement that gave

unprecedented control over the
proceedings to the campaigns.
Neuman called the campaigns’
demands ”outrageous.” They
demanded control over the selec-
tion of questioners, the composi-
tion of the audience, hall access
for the press and other issues.

”The campaigns’ agreement is
a cIosed—door masterpiece,” Neu-
man said/‘Never in the history of
the League of Women Voters
have two candidates’ organiza-
tions come to us with such strin-
gent, unyielding and self—serving
demands.”

Neuman said it's unfortunate
that the American people have
no real opportunities to judge the
presidential candidates outside of
campaign—controlled environ-
m e n t s. _

”On the threshold of a new
millenium, this country remains

BROTHERS’ DUNLAP

the brightest hope for all who
cherish free speech and open de-
bate,” Neuman said. ”Americans
deserve to see and hear the men
who would be president face
each other in a debate on the
hard and complex issues critical
to our progress into the next
century.”

A final challenge to both Vice
President Bush and Gov. Dukakis
was offered by the league. ”Rise

‘above your handlers and ‘agree to

join us in presenting the fair and
full discussion the American pub-
lic expects of the League of
Women Voters debate,” said
Neuman.

The Pennsylvania league did
sponsor some debates which in-
cluded, running for Auditor
General: Bailey vs. Hafer on Oct.
25; State Treasurer: Knoll vs. En-
glish, Oct. 26; and U.S. Senate:
Heinz vs. Oignola, Oct; 18.

NSN puts its support
to Democratic ticket

By Laurie Lehosky
Staff Writer

University communities are
filled with Republicans,
Democrats, Libertarians and
Socialists who are asking the
same question: Who will win
President Ronald Reagan's
seat in the White House?

While the University of Pitts-
burgh Young Democrats sup-
port Dukakis, so does another
campus organization, the New
Student Network.

Recently, the NSN decided
to formally endorse Dukakis

V for the presidential election.

The NSN is a group of mostly
liberal students who are non-
partisan.

”The NSN endorsement is
an independent endorsement

not connected with the Young‘

Democrats,” said junior Mike
Vallor, NSN press contact.
According to Vallor, NSN
does not agree with Dukakis
on every issue, but his position
represents their issues more
closely. NSN is concerned
with issues that affect the fu-

ture of the country and’

mankind.

The issues presently of con-
cern to the group include the
decline of the environment,
the growing gap between the
rich and the poor, military in-
terventions, nuclear war and
government indifference to the
human _ rights of non-
heterosexuals and non—whites.

”NSN is non—partisan. We
are not partisan as being a
party with liberals or
Democrats,” Vallor added,
”we are being partisan with
taking one candidate over
another.”

According to Vallor,
Dukakis’ issues present a more
positive outlook.

NSN based its endorsement
on international and national
issues concerning Dukakis. In-
ternational issues that NSN
agrees with Dukakis on are
calling the designation of
South Africa as a terrorist state,
the termination of aid to the
Contra terrorists in Nicaragua,
and support for a full nuclear
test ban.

National issues of concern
are enabling qualified Ameri-
cans to afford a college educa-
tion, planning to give workers
in Massachusetts manageable
health care and supplying fed-

eral aid for 'low—income
housing.
NSN also recognizes

Dukakis for supporting the
Equal Rights Amendment.
One issue of concern is a
woman’s right to have a
choice on abortion.

”We are not trying to
present a biased opinion,”
Vallor said.

He added, ’’Although this is
a group endorsement, I don’t
agree with all of these partic-
ularly. Some are non-issues to

//

me.

Choices to be made across state

By Michelle L. O'Brien
Staff Writer

Pennsylvania voters will
choose more than the next
U.S. president when they go to
the polls today. The election
will also decide who will fill
the offices of state attorney
general, state treasurer and au-
ditor general.

" Only one of the candidates
seeking these offices is an in-
cumbent. Auditor General
Don Bailey, a Democrat who
has held the office since 1985,
is seeking re-election. Bailey
was a private attorney in
Greensburg from 1970-78 and
a U.S. congressman from
1978-82.

Bailey"'s primary competi-
tion is Republican Barbara
Hafer. She has been an Al-
legheny County commission-
er and president of the
Allegheny County Prison
Board since 1984.

Consumer Party candidate
Max Weiner, Libertarian
David Walter and Populist
Charles Redmond are also on
the ballot. '

Republican Philip English
faces Democrat Catherine
Baker Knoll in the race for
state treasurer. English is the
Erie city controller and served
as executive director of the
state Senate Transportation
Committee from 1983-4.

Knoll has been an executive
assistant in the ‘Allegheny
County Department of Ad-
ministration since 1982. She
previously served as western
regional director of the Penn-
Dot Safety Administration
from 1971-79.

The Consumer Party candi-
date is John Brickhouse of
Philadelphia. He is a former

candidate for the state Legisla-

- ture, lieutenant governor and

Philadelphia City Council.

Libertarian Thomas Radom-
ski is the fourth candidate for
state treasurer. He is the presi-
dent of a construction firm in
Montgomery County.

Democrat Edward Mez-
vinsky and Republican Ernie
Preate have been running a
close race for state attorney
general. Mezvinsky is a form-
er U.S. congressman and state
Democratic committee
chairman.

Preate has been Lackawan—
na County district attorney
since 1977. ’

One of Pennsylvania's two
seats in the U.S. Senate is also
open. Democrat Joe Vignola is
challenging two-term Repub-
lican John Heinz.

During his tenure «in the
Senate, Heinz has been a
member of the finance, bank-
ing, housing and urban affairs
committees.

Vignola, now a private attor-
ney, is a former Philadelphia
city controller and county

J commissioner.

Four Western Pennsylvania
seats in the U.S. Congress will
also be decided by today's
election. All four Democratic
incumbents are seeking re-
election.

However, no incumbent
congressman from Pennsylva-
nia has been defeated since
the 1984 primary.

In the 14th District, Repub-
lican Richard E. Caliguiri, cou-
sin of late Pittsburgh Mayor
Richard S. Caliguiri, is hoping
to oust four-term Democrat
William Coyne.

Caliguiri is the assistant
manager of a -dairy market in
Westmoreland County. He is

a former chairman of the
Libertarian Party of Penn-
sylvania. ’

Coyne was formerly a Pitts-
burgh City Councilman and
member of the state House of
Representatives.

Democrat Doug Walgren is
seeking his sixth term serving
the 18th District. He hasbeen
a member of the Energy and
Commerce Committee and
chairman of the House Sub-
committee on Science,
Research and Technology.

Walgren’s challengers are
Republican John Newman
and Populist James Bailey.
Newman is a private attorney

in Mt. Lebanon. Bailey is a re-

tired employee of the Federal
Home Loan Bank.

Also seeking his sixth term
in Congress is Democrat
Austin Murphy from the 22nd
District. .His challenger is
Republican William Hodg-
ekiss, who won the write-in
campaign for his nomination.

The most senior congress-
man from Western Pennsylva-
nia is Democrat Joseph
Gaydos, who is seeking his
seventh term serving the 20th
District.

Gaydos’ competition is
Populist candidate Richard
Wilson, a truck owner-
operator from Clairton.

No Republicans have filed
to challenge Gaydos.

Pittsburghers will also vote
on a binding referendum to
clarify a section of thecity
charter.

Under the proposed amend-

. ment,”‘acity council president

who becomes mayor, as
Sophie Masloff did upon the
death of former Mayor Richard
Caliguiri, would relinquish his
or her seat on council.

Third party candidates
become historical trivia

By Adam W. Richter

Staff Writer

Today, when the majority of
voters is casting its ballot for
either George Bush or Mike
Dukakis, some peoplewill vote
for one of five third-party candi-
dates. These candidates’ occupa-
tions range from a former U.S.
senator to a psychologist to a bus
mechanic.

Third-party candidates have al-
ways had difficulty in U.S. nation-
al elections. John Anderson, who
ran as an independent in 1980,
was the last one to fare well in the
polls, receiving about 7 percent
of the popular vote against
Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Cart-
er. The last third-party candidate
to rise to the presidency was a
member of the Whig Party in the
19th century, before the, two-
party system was prevalent.

Eugene McCarthy, who ran for 1

the Democratic presidential
nomination in 1968, is running
this year for the Consumer Party.
Although he is the third-party
candidate voters are most likely
to recognize, his campaign has
received very little publicity com-
pared to that of the Libertarians.

The Libertarian Party, with Ron
Paul as its candidate, took out a
full-page ad in Sunday's New
York Times explaining the party's
platform. The ad stated that the
Libertarians want to abolish all
government restrictions on every-

thing ranging from business regu—,

lations to drugs. In addition, this
party wants to eliminate income
tax, the IRS and all forms of so-
cial welfare and foreign aid.
Pitt students may remember the
day Edward Winn and his col-

a beer

leagues from the Worker's
League visited Pittsburgh and
tried to rally support for their so-
cialist platform. Winn, a bus
mechanic from Brooklyn, N.Y., is
running on _a platform designed
to take political and economic
power away from capitalists and
give it to the workers.

Lenora Fulani is the New Alli-
ance candidate for president.
Fulani, a developmental psychol-
ogist from New York, is the New
Alliance Party chairwoman and
ran for New York State governor
in 1986. ' -

David Duke, the former Grand
Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, is
running as the Populist Party's
presidential candidate. As they

did in the 19th century, the ‘

Populists arerunning on a plat-
form of equal rights for everyone.

In spite of the number of third
parties this year, certain familiar
faces areimissing from the elec-
tion. Forexample, both the Com-
munist and Citizen parties have
no candidates in this campaign.

In addition, Lyndon LaRouche
can no longer run due to his in-
dictment a short time ago. This
has not stopped him from at‘-

tempting to run, although his

name is not on the ballot.

In spite of the fact that there are-

seven choices on the ballot this ‘

year, the five minor parties will,
as they have in the past, get lost
in the struggle between Bush and
Dukakis. This will not change the
fact that it is improbable anyone
will hear from the this election’s
independent candidates in 1992.

College Democrats urge all to vote

By Jessica Coville
Staff Writer

As the presidential election
heads into its final hours and
minutes, the fervor intensifies
with the Young College
Democrats on the Pitt campus.

The Pitt News spoke with
George Nixon, who is a represen-
tative of the Pitt political organi-
zation, and asked him about the
general atmosphere of the group.

The Pitt News: What are the
Young College Democrats doing
in the last hours of this year's
presidential election?

Nixon: These last few days are
very important. We have a mas-
sive effort called "Get out the
vote.” We have the city separat-
ed into sections, and we're doing
literature drops all over.

We're concentrating on high
visibility. On Election Day, we'll
have signs up all over campus
and Oakland. We also have signs
that say "Honk if you're smarter
than Dan Quayle.”

We'll have a large phone bank
which will be manned by Pitt stu-
dents and Pittsburgh residents. 
those not working on the phones
 will be going door to door, see-
ing if the voters have made it to
the polls yet. If they don't have
transportation, then we will pro-
vide it for them.

The Pitt News: What is the at-
mosphere among the Young Col-
lege Democrats?

Nixon: It's been more positive
than it has been in a long time.

 

We've come from a I4 point
spread to a five point difference.

Last week's rally was excep-
tionally wonderful. [Dukakis ap-
peared at the [David] Lawrence
Convention Center on Nov. 2.]
Someone called people and told
them it was $25 a head, which
wasn't true. We don't knowvwho
called, but there were 8,000 peo-
ple in attendance, and it was very
successful.

The Pitt News: How do you
feel the campaign has been run
on the local level? on the nation-
al level?

Nixon: In Pittsburgh it couldn't
have been more successful. Oak-
land alone had the highest per-
centage of newly registered
Democrats in Allegheny County,
this largely due to the effort of the
Young College Democrats at Pitt.

On the national level, there
was a slow start. The past couple
of weeks the campaign has been
on fire. Mike Dukakis’ rise in the
polls has" helped everyone get

, more motivated.

The Pitt News: In retrospect, if
anything about the campaign
could have been changed, what
would that be?

Nixon: Well, definitely, it
would be to clear up the lies and
distortions more quickly. Get the
truth out.

The Pitt News: To what do you

attribute Dukakis’ slide in the]

polls last month? _

Nixon: [It has] probably [been]
due to campaign doldrums and
successful negative campaigning

The Pitt News: To many peo-
ple polled, the general feeling is
that there is a poor choice of can-
didates. Why do you think they
feel like this?

Nixon: Well, it's the first time
we've seen a campaign so nega-
tively run.

There have been few times in
this election that the actual issues
have been discussed. Even The
Washington Post didn't want to
endorse a candidate. I'm sure
they'll be moaning about voter
apathy after the election is over.

. The Pitt News: Who do you?

think is going to win?

Nixon: I think Michael Dukakis
is going to surprise everyone and
win. It's tight, but we're going to
do it.

The Pitt News: What are the
Young College Democrats going
to do after the election?

Nixon: The Young College
Democrats have awakened a real
sense of enthusiasm on campus,
and I see them continuing their
efforts even after the election.

I know that I'll personally try
[to] get a good night's sleep. I also
need to catch up on my studies.

The Pitt News: Is there any-
thing else? ‘

Nixon: We'd like to encourage
everyone to get out and vote.

THE PITT NEWS, Tuesday, November 8, i988

By Erik Kridle

Staff Writer

The president of the univer-
sity's Students for Bush has
predicted that George Bush
will win the presidency Tues-
day by a "landslide of the
Electoral College but not of the
popular vote.”

In an interview Sunday,
Daryl Grecich said he expects
the vice president to win the
majority of the popular vote in
at least 40 states. However, he
said, he is afraid Bush will lose
Pennsylvania to Michael
Dukakis, due to the large num-
ber of Democratic voters in
the urban centers of Pittsburgh
and Philadelphia.

Grecich_said that the nega-
tive tone of the candidates in
this year's campaign was un-
fortunate. ~

"There has always been
negative campaigning,"
Grecich said. "|t's a shame
that they have to resort to it,
but I think it is sometimes
necessary to catch the eye of
the voter."

Grecich also said he is con-
vinced that Dan Quayle‘ is a
’’well qualified" candidate-for
the vice presidency. He
claimed that the Democratic
Party's repeated criticism of
Quayle was an act of desper-

ticket.

According to Grecich, the
Democratic Party no longer
represents the best interests of
all the working classes. The
previous generation grew up
in a time when social security
and medicare were needed,
he said. The federal govern-
ment saw the need, and
hence, created new social
programs.

"Today’s voters are looking
past socioeconomic distinc-
tions and are now muchmore

ation to discredit the Bush.

Pitt Republicans look
for landslide Bush win

concerned with ideology —-
whether one is a liberal or a
conservative," Grecich said.

"A liberal is a big spender,
while a conservative believes
in cutting government.spend—
ing,” he said.

Dukakis is liberal in other l

areas than economics,
Grecich added. Dukakis’
refusal to require teachers in
Massachusetts to lead their
classes in the Pledge of Allegi-
ance "sets him apart as a
liberal.''

"The Pledge of Allegiance
isn't part of the important cam-
paign issues, but it is important

to many voters," Grecich said. ’

Grecich said Bush has a
commitment to helping aca-
demically deserving students
of meager income to attend
college.

And college enrollment has
not dropped, despite the Rea-
gan cuts in student financial
aid, he said.

"Vice President Bush sup-
ports financial aid for those
who are truly in need,"
Grecich said, "By cutting aid
to those who really can afford
college, more aid is made
available for people who can't
afford it."

Grecich also said he fears
many small companies will go
bankrupt if Congress approves
Dukakis’ proposal requiring all
companies to provide health
insurance to their employees.

"Who is he [Bush] to say
that companies must pay
health insurance for all their

employees? But that doesn't.

mean he doesn't care for the
working class in general,"
Grecich said. "George Bush is
in this campaign for the Ameri-
can people. He hears them,
and he respects them."

Grecich is a senior econom-
ics and political science major.

‘ It is important to take

the time to go vote

The time has come.

The campaigning is over. The debating is over. The
mudslinging is over. It is Election Day.

This has been one of the worst elections in our nation's
history, yet nothing is more important than today's ballot

casting.

Either Vice President George Bush or Gov. Michael
Dukakis will be the next occupant of the Oval Office, con-
trolling the direction of- this country for the next four years.
Bush, regardless of what the polls say, has not clinched
the election, and Pennsylvania is one of themost crucial
states in the election. Your vote will really have an impact.

The right to vote is the most important right that a citizen
of this country has. It is more than a right, it is a respson-
sibilty. To vote means to be involved and to have some
concern about the United States of America. Whomever
you like, whatever your leanings may be, it is your duty

t0 VOt€. ' r

Today's voting should not be a chore; skip class if you
must, but vote. If you don't, then somebody else will

choose for you.

In a nutshell...

”After seven years of charisma, maybe it’s time for some
competence in the White House.”

'— Michael Dukakis

”This election will be based on the issues, not the ads.”

— George Bush

Horton was Bush's best man

After the presidential election
is over, political, debts must be
paid. The men and women who
did the most for their Candidates
have to be rewarded. -

And so it will be after Nov. 8.

ART
BUCHWALD

If George Bush wins, there is
no doubt that the person who'll
get all the credit is Willie Horton,
the murderer-rapist who was
given a weekend furlough from
a Massachussetts prison and then
committed rape and beat up a
couple. . V

A Bush staffer said, ”We owe
Willie everything. He was prob-
ably the most important issue in
the entire election, and the can-
didate doesn't forget the people
who were there when Mr. Bush
needed them.”

”How did you find Willie?”

”The campaign was looking for
a murderer-rapist to illustrate how
soft Dukakis was on crime. Wil-
lie’s name popped up in the com-
puters, and we rushed it over to
the boss. At first, George, who is
by nature a kinder, gentler per-
son, didn't want anything to do
with it. He told us, ‘This will
make Dukakis look bad because
Willie's furlough took place on
his watch.’ But Bush's handlers

said, ’You owe it to the country
to reveal what a sleazy governor
Dukakis really is.’ ”
”That should have
George,” I said. I .
”When Bush traveled out on
the stump with the Willie Horton
issue, the crowds went wild -
and just in time. Up until then,
the candidate, had put hisiau-
diences to sleep with his plan for
the environment‘, and every time
George discussed the deficit, it
was Valium time. But as soon as
George mentioned rape and
murder and Willie Horton, he got
nothing but standing ovations.”
”-\/Vere his supporters cheering
murder and rape as anidea?”
”No, they were cheering the
fact that the governor had let Wil-
lie Horton out of the pokey,
which showed what kind of a

sold

President Mike Dukakis would.
make.  The people couldn't get I

enough of the speech.

”Supporters drove hundreds of
miles just to hear George tell
them how dumb it was to have
let Horton out of prison. We cir-
culated pictures of Willie on the
covers of programs at GOP fund-
raisers, and people doubled their
contributions.”

”Have you ever thought of hav-
ing Mr. Bush meet and thank Wil-
lie for all he's done?”

”It’s a great photo opportunity, ‘

but we decided not to do it until

after the election. Don’tforget,
besides screwing up his furlough,
Willie also endorsed Dukakis for
president from his cell.”

”Was that your idea?” I asked
the staffer.

No, Willie's. He thought of it
all by himself. I think he’s hop-
ing to be awarded the Medal of
Freedom if Bush getsginto the
White House.” _

”It’s going to be hard for the
Bush administration to find a job
for Willie now that he is back in
the pen.”

“Something will come up —
maybe an ambassadorship to a
small country that doesn’t mind
diplomats with a criminal
record.”

”Perhaps you could name a
government building after him?”

”Bush was thinking of ’The -

Willie Horton Post Office’ across
from the governor’s mansion in
Boston.  . .

’’I’m sure Willie would like

/I

‘that. You know, it’s quite possi-

ble that if Willie‘ had known he
was going to be the most impor-
tant person in the I988 presiden-
tial race, he might have gone
straight and never committed a
crime at all.” T

”That wouldn't have done him ’

any good. If he had kept clean,
no one in the Bush campaign
would have even mentioned his
name.”

This year's ’commercial’ election is a worthless one

Well, today is the day. Finally’.
The day that I thought would
never come. The day when all
the commercials, all the mud
slinging, all the propaganda
would come to an end, and you,
the great, patriotic Americans that
you all are, can finally decide
who you want_ to be your presi-
dent for the next four years or
forty thousand miles (or one fa-
tal gun shot wound). I say ”you,”
because I, a total left wing liber-
al, do not and will not vote.

”What if everyone thought that
way?” so many people feel com-

‘ pelled to ask me. First of all, who

cares what everyone thinks, and
secondly, I can only reply that I
hope and pray that someday
everyone does feel that way, and
Americans no longer have to
wade through all the BULL that
is involved with choosing a
presidential Candidate.

The worst part is that most

 

MARK .
STAF ~

voters are so confused by all of
the garbage that is pumped into
their heads from all of the politi-
cal advertising, the defamation of
one candidate by another, and
the ability of the candidates to
make themselves look totally
stupid, that they go to the polls
to choose, get this, ”The lesser of

the two evils.” In other words,
eighty percent of the voters that
are going to the polls today are
unqualified to do so since the two
candidacies have clouded the
voters’ minds with crap.

Let's face it, this is not a
presidential election, it is a beau-
ty contest. Not a contest of who
is the best man for the job due to
qualifications, since both candi-
dates have totally avoided all of
the issues. No, this election is all
about who can look better than
the other. Or, especially in this
case, ‘who can look less worse
than the other. A wise man, I for-
get who, noted, ’’If Vanna White
had a good PR man, she would
be the next president.” It is sad
how true that fact is.

It is true, at least here at the
university. I have been asking
many people around Pitt who
they are going to vote for and
why. Surprisingly, and against

many nationwide polls, Dukakis
is way ahead of Bush here at Pitt.

”Why Duke?” I ask. Unsurpris-
ingly, the popular response by
my peersis, ”Because I don't
want Bush and Quayle, especial-
ly Quayle, in office.” Hardly ever
do I hear something like, ”Well
Bush has great foreign relations.”
or, ”Dukakis is for the common,
middle-class man.” No. I hear,
”Bush is such a friendly guy and
Mike is so rigid and stem.” or,
”Dukakis is cool, and Quayle is
just a plain butthead.”

I_must admit, that I can't under-
stand why Bush would pick
Quayle. If Bush had picked any-
one else, even Woodsy The Owl,
Bush would be a shoe—in. But no.
Bush found it necessary to pick
someone that the press and the
National Comedians Association
has had a field day with. Besides,
just thinking of Bush dropping
dead, and Quayle sitting in the

Oval Office is enough to make

me take the next plane to _

Canada.

But nomatter what I do, the
election is here. And whether I
vote for Bush, Dukakis,_or start
saving money for my plane tick-
et to Canada, one of these candi-
dates, neither of whom have
proven themselves and their run-
ning mates as worthy. for the
office of the President of The
United States of America, two of
these four men are on their way

to deciding the outcome of our

future.

But some very important ques-
tions still remain. Which one of
these guys are most qualified to
hold such an important office?
Are the American people going to
the polls with education of who
is best suited to lead thiscountry

or just opinions of who is a |ess- -

erevﬂ?

juries earlier in the season, it
was expected that the Pitt (5-3)
offense would have a gaping
hole at that position; Walker

Richards has played in all
eight games so far this season,
but it was the Boston College
game (he came in when Walk.-
erwas bothered by a groin in-
jury) that opened people's
eyes. Richards carried the ball
for 202 yards against the Ea-
gles in a Heywardesque per-
formance.
’’When I came to Pittsburgh

5—foot-10, 190 pounds, said. ’’I
just wanted to play some

down, I got my chance and

The Pittwground game was
stuffed by Notre Dame in the
next game, and Richards

yards against Syracuse and
209 against Notre Dame). Yet,
Richards doesn’t feel any
pressure.

’’I just play the game,”
Richards said. ”Against Rut-
gers it was a little tough be-
cause of the rain. When the
water got into my shoes and
socks, it made everything
heavy. The cold stiffened my
muscles up, and I was a little
tired after every run.”

Still he persevered and kept
going.

Pitt offensive guard Mark
Stepnoski sees a lot of talent in
Richards and enjoys blocking
for a runner with his skills.

”He is a fast kid, and he has
the ability to make people
miss him," Stepnoski said.
”He reads the blocks real well
and takes the most advantage
of the blocks. Anytime you
_have somebody like that back

there it makes it a lot easier on
us.

’’I think every week he has
gotten a little more comforta-

That’s why he has been able
to get so many yards.”

Richards has shown» that he
can play major college foot-

a better grip on the offense ev-

field.

”When you get to play in

repetition in practice, you start
to ‘feel at home,” Richards
said. ”That’s what's happening

Just a few pieces left over from
‘a sports weekend:

0 The NBA has started its latest
campaign, and there have al-
ready been a‘ few surprises. First
of all, Joe Barry Carroll of the
New Jersey Nets returned to his
old form by scoring over 20
points. It is about time. Carroll
has had a lot of promise but has
never really lived up to it. If you
were starting an NBA team and
needed a center, he might not be
a bad choice.

Former Pitt star Charles Smith
A has started off his pro career with
the Los Angeles Clippers*‘quite
well. In a loss to Philadelphia last
Friday, Smith knocked in 15

7 points to help keep the Clippers
close. In a win against the Mia-
mi Heat Saturday night, Smith
contributed 18 to the cause.

to comedy and everything that's

Although the season is still very
young, he is proving some peo-
ple wrong.

O The NFL went topsy—turvy
again this week. There were
several upsets, the biggest being
the Cardinals’ 24-23 victory over
the 49ers.

The ’Nineiss have fallen upon a
lot of troubles this season. They
are currently 6-4 and third in the
NFC West behind the New
Orleans Saints (7-3) and the sur-
prising Los Angeles Rams'(7—3).
They are in bad shape. Quarter-
back and catalyst Joe Montana is
not at 100 percent, and there is
a lot of complaining on the club.
This doesn't look like a team on
the way to the playoffs.

for fallen Coach Mike Ditka on
Sunday. Earlier in the week, Dit-

ka suffered a mild heart attack

went out to beat Tampa Bay,
28-10.

The Bucs are not the best of
teams, and the Bears would nor-
mally beat them. But when some-
body so close to you, as Ditka is
to his players, goes down, it takes
a lot to get up for a game. The
Bears did a great job.

0 The Pittsburgh Press had the
best headline of the day on Mon-
day. They declared the Steelers’
42-7 loss to the Bengals as
”Amateur hour.” That summed
up the whole game. The Steelers
were thoroughly outclassed by
the first—place Bengals.

Cincinnati exploded for 559 to-
tal offensive yards, while holding
Pittsburgh to only 198. The Steel-
er offense was pitiful, and the
defense wasn’t much better.

THE PITT NEWS, Tuesday, November 8, 1988

Brown becomes star
‘receiver for Bengals
offense so far in '88

By Joe Kay
‘P Sports Writer

CINCINNATI — Cris Collins-
worth remembers a time not too
long ago when receiver Eddie
Brown was the talk of the Cincin-
nati Bengals.

In his fourth season, Brown is

g becoming the talk of the NFL.

Brown caught two touchdown
passes Sunday and seven in all for
a c|ub—record 216 yards in a-42-7
drubbing of the Pittsburgh Steel-
ers. The performance gave him
some impressive numbers for the

ieasonz eight touchdowns, 1,015

yards receiving and an average of
nearly 24 yards per catch.
' It's what the Bengals hoped to
get when they made Browngtheir
No. 1 draft choice in 1985 from

, Miami, Fla., where he set school
records catching Bernie Kosar’s
passes.

”When we drafted him, I can
remember them talking about
him,” Collinsworth said. ’’I can
remember how happy they all

Overe because they wanted Eddie.
Now he's finally living up to what
everybody expected of him.”

Brown had a good rookie sea-
son, catching 53 passes and eight
touchdowns with a 17.8-yard
average per reception. His aver-
age dropped each of the last two
seasons, and he caught just three
touchdowns each year.

When Collinsworth suffered a

‘leg injury in preseason, Brown as-

sumed the bulk of the receiving
duties. He had six catches for 143
yards and a touchdown in the
season opener against Phoenix, a
sign of things to come.

The 6—foot, 185-pound Brown

‘is a perfect fit for the Bengals’

high-powered offense. His speed
allows him to get open for Boom-
er Esiason’s long—range passes.
His cutting ability lets him turn
short receptions into long gains.

”Eddie is a very explosive
receiver,” said Esiason, who has
thrown eight of his 20 touch-
down passes to Brown. ”Anytime
you get a receiver with that
amount of talent on a cornerback

[in man—to-man coverage], he’s
going to have a big day.”

That's exactly what happened
Sunday. Brown burned corner-
back Dwayne Woodruff on the
Bengals’ second play from scrim-
mage for an 86-yard touchdown
catch, the third—longest pass play
in team history.

”He’s got good coverage tech-
nique,” Brown said. ”You’ve got
to give him a burst. On the long
pass, he turned the opposite way
and I had a jump on him.”

‘Brown also burned the Steeler
secondary with receptions of 41,
38 and 24 yards.

”| just wanted to have a big
day,” said Brown, who had just
one catch for a 65-yard touch-
down in the Bengals’ 17-12 vic-
tory in Pittsburgh earlier this
season. ’’I had a big day, and it
came out to be a record.”

The previous single-game club
record was 206 yards by Collins-
worth against Baltimore in 1983.
Brown topped it with a 41-yard
reception in the fourth quarter.

”The play he set the record on
was designed to go to me,” Col-
linsworth said. ”But I got jammed
and only got a yard—and—a—half
downfield.”

Collinsworth congratulated
Brown when he learned his
record had been topped.

”He was the first one to come
up to me,” Brown said. ’’It was
a good feeling for me. I’m just
looking forward to setting more
records.”

Collinsworth is ready to pass
the torch to Brown, who needs
just 116 yards to break Collins-
worth’s club record for reception
yardage in a season. He also
needs just three more touchdown
catches to top the record of 10 in
a season, shared by Collinsworth
and Isaac Curtis.

”Something tells me that's not
the last record of mine he's go-

’ ing to break,” Collinsworth said

of the single-game mark that fell
Sunday. ”They all might be
broken by the end of the season.”

Pirates name Doughty as general
manager to help improve chances

By Alan Robinson
AP Sports Writer

Larry Doughty, a low-key
player development expert
who hopes to continue Syd
Thrift’s rebuilding program
without the accompanying
front-office friction, was
named Monday to succeed
Thrift as the Pittsburgh Pirates’
general manager.

Doughty, former Cincinnati

Reds’ scouting director who —

was hired as Thrift’s top aide
last year, becomes just the
fourth Pirates general manager
in the last 32 years, following
Joe L. Brown, Harding ”Pete”
Peterson and Thrift.

Doughty’s team-player im-
age contrasts with the high-
profile, individualistic style fa-
vored by Thrift, whose three-
year tenure was highlighted by
a remarkable on-field tur-
naround but constant off-field
feuding.

Pirates President Carl Barg-
er hinted Doughty’s ”we’re-in-
this-together” attitude was as
big a selling point as his repu-
tation for being a sensible,
sound baseball man.

Doughty has been the in-
terim general manager since
Thrift’s Oct. 4 ouster.

”He had all the attributes we
were looking for in a general
manager,” Barger said. ”He is
a consummate worker who is
extremely well organized, a
team player in every respect.”

Despite the Pirates’ swift im-
provement from 104—game
losers in 1985 to money-

making pennant contenders in.
1988, Thrift’s refusal to share .

the credit for Pittsburgh's base-
ball resurgence led to his Oct.
4 firing by Barger and board
chairman Douglas Danforth.

Thrift infuriated team own-
ers by failing to consult them
on major transactions, but
Doughty said he not only
would seek approval for each
trade, he would welcome it.

”Any significant trade in-
volving a certain number of
dollars — I'll keep the number
in my head — I will seek their
approval,” Doughty said. ”I’m
a prudent man, and I'm a
reasonable person when it
comes to dollars, I'm sensible.
 They are going to be aware
of what I'm trying to do.”

Doughty’s hiring was ru-
mored for several weeks, but
Barger said the Pirates’ search
was anything but cosmetic.

”We talked to people both
inside and outside our organi-
zation, and, in every instance,
the reports were glowing,”
Barger said. "I thinkloe Brown
said it best, that he never saw
a person accepted so quickly
by an organization or earn as
much respect so quickly as
Larry did.”

Doughty, 48, shares Thrift’s
philosophy that a contender is
built with a strong farm sys-
tem, occasional trades and ex-
perienced minor—league
instruction.

’’I believe in a strong work

"ethic and putting in the time

and the energy and the effort
to get a job done right,” he
said’. ”You hire the right peo-
ple and put them in place, and
allow them the full run of their
responsibilities to build a

- championship team.”

Doughty said his lack of ex-
perience in making trades
won't be a handicap because
”knowledgeable baseball peo-
ple know of my abilties to as-
sess talent.  We need to
make a couple of trades, but
people who consider me to be
naive might be in for a sur-
prise. I don't think anybody is
going to sneak up on us.”

Doughty hopes to acquire a
more offense—oriented short-
stop, a left—handed reliever and
a right-handed hitter capable
ofdriving in runs. He said the
Pirates are willing to give up
some of their pitching and left-
handed hitting strength.

Doughty spent 17 years in
the Reds system until resigning
as scouting director in Septem-
ber 1987 after large—sca|e
budget cutbacks were ordered
by team President Marge
Schott. He was a scouting su-
pervisor and an assistant direc-
tor of scouting until being
promoted to scouting director
in 1982.

Chief Bender, a Reds’ vice
president, said Doughty is ”a
good company man, a good
organization man.

”He has a good reputation
around baseball and good
baseball associations,” Bender
said. ’’I wouldn't say he's shy.
He’s difficult to get to know
a laid—back guy. I think he’ll be
very good in contract dealing
and in trading, too. He hasall
the qualifications.”

STRESS - CULTS - INTUITION

THE PITT NEWS, Tuesday, November 8, 1988

Noll doesn't think '88.
record is indicative of

talent on Steeler team

By Alan Robinson
AP Sports Writer

PITTSBURGH —— The Pitts-
burgh Steelers haven't seen bad
times like these since the late
1960s, but Coach Chuck Noll
said Monday their 2-8 record and
a 42-7 loss to the Cincinnati Ben-
gals aren’t the result of deficient
talent.

The Steelers, whose record is
their worst since their 1969 team
finished 1-13, allowed a team-
record 559 yards Sunday to Cin-
cinnati in what Noll said was as
dismal a loss as any in his 20-year
tenure, '

But Noll, who said the Steelers
"couldn’t have beaten a grade
school team,” insisted they ha-
ven't packed it in and still have
the talent to win games.

”Everybody keeps wanting to
know what kind of talent we
have,” Noll said at his weekly
news conference. ”Sunday, our
talent wasn’t very good because
we didn't perform. When we per-
form well, our talent is excellent.
What we have to do is get good
performance, and our talent has
been fine.”

But the Steelers haven't been
getting many good performances.

They have lost eight of nine
games since a season—opening
24-21 victory over Dallas, are 0-4
against their AFC Central Divi-
sion rivals and have lost by mar-
gins of 14, 17, 20 and 35 points.

After cornerback Dwayne
Woodruff was burned repeated-
ly by Bengals’ wideout Eddie
Brown, who made seven catches
for 216 yards, Noll reportedly
told his players that perhaps more
of them should seek law degrees.

Woodruff learned last week he
passed the bar exam.

Noll wouldn’.t comment on the 

remark Monday, but admitted he
is concerned about the Steelers’
effort, or the lack thereof.

”Yeah, it is a problem,” Noll
said. "Whether, in our anxiety to
get things going, we left it on the
practice field last week. We prob-
ably had the fiercest Contact
we’ve had this year in our prac-
tice sessions.  We had three
tights.

‘'1 don't know ifthat helped us
or not. it probably slowed us
down a little bit.”

The Steelers, who play the
Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday,
have potential, ”but potential
that's not realized doesn’t do a
whole lot of good,” he said.

Noll said the Steelers won't use
the final six weeks of the season
to launch a full—scale youth move-
ment because injuries already
have forced them to use almost
every player on their 47—man
roster.

”We’re playing a lot of peo-
ple,” he said. ”The ones we
aren't playing aren't in there be-
cause they’re not ready  and
you don't want somebody, to
screw up and get somebody
hurt.”

Noll said he's not ready to
write off the season ”even though
we’re not going to win the con-
ference, because you have to live
with them for a whole season. 
Report cards aren't due until the
end of the year.”

But do the Steelers have the
character needed to repeat their
1986 late—season comeback,
when they won five of their final
nine games after a 1-6 start?

”|’l| let you know after the sea-
son’s over,” Noll said. ”Right
now, we’ve got to find out if we
can come back after something
like this [the Bengals’ loss]. We'd
had a string there where we were
playing well  this was a break
in the string.”

As he said two years ago, Noll
said the current Steelers must
play not only to win games, but
to win jobs. He hinted some
Steelers may have relaxed men-
tally after winning their jobs dur-
ing the preseason.

”Everybody has to establish
himself in the league,” he said.
”We can be a spoiler the rest of
the season  but when you're a
football player, you want to play
in this league for a long time, and
you have to want to earn respect
from your peers.” ‘

taineers continue to roll over less-
than—good opponents. This week,

Qhey beat Cincinnati 51-13. They
are rolling up the points, but,
aside from Pitt, haven't faced a
good defense. They might be un-
defeated, but they are not in the
same class as Notre Dame, USC
or Florida State.

0 Well, as usual, the Pens lost
in Philadelphia. They might
never win there again. It would
not be a bad bet. ln fact, they

Oroutine at the news conference

following the Rutgers game. It all
started when a question was

taken off the field for not wear-

When asked what Coach Mike
Gottfried said when they came
off the field, Grossman respond-
ed, ”Get your damn hip—pads

When asked about the advan-
tage of not wearing hip—pads,

ties,” Richards said earlier in the
season. ”They don't know much
about football over there. They
mostly play soccer.”

Richards has to be used to rack-
ing up so many yards by now. As
a high school senior Richards ran
for 1,159 yards and scored 14
touchdowns. He was an All—State
selection for that effort.

Although Richards has gained
a lot of his yards as part of his
natural athletic ability, he gives
most of the credit to the offensive
line.

”The reason I am able to gain
so many yards is because of what
the offensive line does in front of
me,” Richards said. ”They are
very solid and .do much of the
work.”

With the injuries that Pitt has
had to play through this season,
Richards has had to play behind

a number of different lines. At—

various times this season, Tom
Ricketts, Roman Matusz and
Chris Goetz have not been able

to play. This isn't a problem for

Richards because he feels that the
team has capable back—ups.

”There is really no effect on
me,” Richards said. ”We have
great depth on the offensive line.
The next guy can come in and
play just as well as the first guy.
So, with the line changing every
week, that doesn’t bother me at
all.”

Because of the rain during the
first half of the Rutgers game, the
Panthwers had to go mainly to the
ground game. Richards and quar-
terback Darnell Dickerson were
the whole offense (the Panthers
rushed for 384 yards). Dickerson
has faith in that offensive scheme.

”We run the ball real well,”

Dickerson said. ”We have faith
in Curvin and allthe backs.”

Richards has made a lot of
strides so far this season. With
three games left in the '88 regu-
lar season, there is no sign that he
is slowing down.

son why the Reds signed
players such as Chris Sabo, Kal
Daniels, Kurt Stillwell, Barry

”The Reds decided to go

HOUSTON —- Art Howe, who
played seven seasons for
Houston, came home as manager
Monday with a two—year contract
and a vow to return the Astros to
the playoffs.

Howe, 41, a coach for the past
four seasons with the Texas
Rangers, replaces Hal Lanier,
who was fired at the end of last
season. His only managing ex-
perience was four years in Puer-
to Rico.

”My most vivid memories as a
player here were the 1980

playoffs, probably the most excit-
ing playoff series that was ever
played,” Howe said.

’’I like the talent we have here
right now, and we hope to bring
that excitement back and go far-
ther than we did in 1980.”

Howe and Astros first base
coach Matt Galante were finalists
to become the 10th manager in
the franchise's history.

Howe said his first priority
would be to fill_ the remaining
coaching vacancies and said
former Astrosiplayer Phil Garner
would be among the candidates.

Howe named new Astros manager

Galante will remain with the
team, Howe said, and will prob-
ably move to third base. He said
Yogi Berra, also retained from the
previous staff, would serve as hit-
ting coach.

Les Moss remains as the pitch-
ing coach.

The Astros won the National
League Western Division title in
1986 with Lanier as the rookie
manager.

But the Astros faded in Septem-
ber the next two seasons and
finished in fifth place last season,
12‘/2 games behind first-place Los
Angeles.

Astros General Manager Bill

Wood stressed Howe’s player
communication skills, for which
Lanier often was criticized.

”His communication skills
checked out well with every
source, and his motivational skills
ranked high with all those we
talked to,” Wood said.

Howe left the Astros as a free‘
agent after the 1983 season and
closed out his career with the St.
Louis Cardinals.

He had a career .260 batting
average and hit a career high
.296 with the Astros in 1981.

Howe said he would continue
the aggressive style of baseball
that Lanier brought to the team.

/\/lore honors come in

for Dodgers’ manager’

after successful season

By Ronald Blum

AP Sports Writer

NEW YORK — Tommy Lasor-
da, already named manager of
the year in the National League
by the Baseball Writers’ Associa-
tion of America, now has

received the same honor for both V

leagues from The Associated
Press. I

Lasorda was the overwhelming
choice as the AP Major League
Manager of the Year for 1988 in
voting announced Monday.

The Los Angeles manager, who
led his team to the World Series
championship, received 97‘/2
points in voting by a nationwide
panel of sports writers and broad-
casters. Boston Red Sox Manager
Joe Morgan was second with
26% points, Oakland Manager
Tony LaRussa was-third with 25
points, and Detroit Tigers
Manager Sparky Anderson was
fourth with 11 points.

Lasorda said the award was
more a tribute to the Dodgers or-
ganization than himself.

’’It was just not a victory of a
World Series, it was a shining ex-
ample to all people of what you
can accomplish and what can
happen in life if you really and

truly believe in yourself.” he said.

”The thing about this World
Series, as I told the president of
the United States, it proved that
the people of this country like the
underdog. I haven't ever seen as
much interest in the World Ser-
ies as I saw this year.

”Nobody thought we had even 

a slight chance of beating the
Mets in the playoffs. Nobody
thought we could even come
close to beating them. And then
when we went into the World
Series, no one thought we could
come close to beating the Ath-
letics.” '

Los Angeles, 94-67 this year,
has won the NL West six times in

12 seasons. Two other years, the 3

Dodgers were in contention un-
til that last weekend. Lasorda has
led the Dodgers with sometimes
funny,‘ sometimes profane
motivational speeches. He acts —
and probably is — a master
motivator.

Now he's is on his offseason
schedule, giving motivational
speeches to businesses and other -.
groups. He said winning the
World Series made the offseason '
nice, but not necessarily busier.

”With me, it's been like that for
a dozen years,” Lasorda said. ”I
got a schedule that Lewis and

Clark couldn't keep up with. It ‘V

makes you feel better, knowing
that you're manager of the cham-
pionship Dodgers. The recep-
tions are that much nicer.”

THE PITT NEWS, Tuesday, November 8, 1988

(AP) ~ Colorado's football
team is back in the Top 20 for the
first time in 10 years. But the stay
could be a short one.

The Buffaloes, ranked 19th in
this week's Associated Press poll,
visit No. 7 Nebraska Saturday.
Colorado, coming off a 45-8 vic-
tory over Missouri, has lost 19 of
its last 20 games against the Corn-
huskers.

”The game we have this
weekend will determine if we
can stay in,” said Colorado coach
Bill McCartney, whose team is
7-2. ”But in the meantime, it's
great to be ranked. It means a lot
for the program.”

Washington State, 6-3 follow-
ing a 24-21 win over Stanford,
returned to the Top 20 after a
seven-year absence.

”For us to be ranked No. 20 is
good recognition for the job
we've done,” Washington State
coach Dennis Erickson said. ’’It’s

a very good thing for our ‘

program.” . .

While Colorado and Washing-
ton State moved into the\._Second
10, there were no changes in. the
Top 10.

Notre Dame remained No. 1

with a 54-11 victory over winless
Rice, receiving 42 of 59 first-
place votes and 1,160 of a possi-
ble 1,180 points from a nation-
wide panel of sports writers and
sportscasters.

Second-ranked Southern
California, which trounced
California 35-3, gained some
ground on the Irish. The Trojans,
who host Notre Dame on Nov.
26, received 15 first—place votes
and 1,122 points.

Last week, with 58 members of
the 60-man panel participating,
Notre Dame led 44-11 in first-

place ballots and 1,144-1,097 in
points.

Third—ranked Miami and No.4
West Virginia each received one
first-place vote. The Hurricanes,
who beat Tulsa 34-3, had 1,065
points while the Mountaineers,
who routed Cincinnati 51-13,
had 979.

Rounding out the Top 10 are
Florida State, UCLA, Nebraska,
Oklahoma, Auburn and
Wyoming.

Florida State, which blasted
South Carolina 59-0, received
933 points.
