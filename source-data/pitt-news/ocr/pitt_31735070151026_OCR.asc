Pitt hires
new

As the Pitt volleyball team prepares
for next season, it will do so under
a new head coach with champion-
ship experience.

just one month after leading
the volleyball team at Concordia
University in Irvine, Calif., to an
undefeated season and its ﬁrst
NAIA championship, Dan Fisher
joins the Panthers ahead of their
ﬁrst season as members of the
Atlantic Coast Conference. He re-
places Toby Rens, who spent ﬁve
years leading the Pitt volleyball
team before leaving theprogram
last month and taking a j ob at Chi-
cago State University. —

“[Rens’] contract was not re-
newed. It was a personnel decision.
We’re going to decline further com-
ment beyond that,” Pitt athletics
spokesman Ted Feeley said.

For Fisher, the opportunity to
coach in the ACC is an honor.

“The ACC is and will always be
one of the top conferences in the
nation,” Fisher said in a press re-
lease. “To be a good team in the
ACC means you are one of the best
teams in the nation. Playing in that
league will prepare our team for
the NCAA tournament.”

Fisher was the head coach at
Concordia for two years, and his
Eagles compiled a record of 75-2
under his watch. Before this year’s

Aaron Stier-Cohen

Once upon a time, Big T — or as he
is better known, Terry Milani — was
a 4oth—round draft pick for the St.
Louis Cardinals. Now, Milani, the
associate director of Student Life
and director of Student Volunteer
Outreach, spends his time running
from ofﬁce to oﬂice —— not base to
base.

Though he works in the Student
Volunteer Outreach ofﬁces, Milani’s
presence is felt throughout the Wil-
liam Pitt Union. As overseer of tlie
Student Activities Fund, Milani
works closely with the Student Or-
ganization Resource Center and

the Student Government Board to A

distribute and allocate funds.
“I’m not there to dictate what’s
going on in an autocratic way,” Mi-

‘ lani said. “I need to be knowledge-

able in what [people] do so I can help
and facilitate where I can.”

The man is generally credited
with the creation of the current SGB
allocations system, the University
Student Organization Certiﬁca-
tion program, the Graduate and
Professional Student Association,

the Emerging Leaders and Student

Development Transcript programs,
the Commuter Resource Center, the
Student Organization Resource Cen-
ter and the Pitt Program Council.

On December 13, 2012, Chancel-
lor Nordenberg recognized Milani
for 40 years of service to Pitt.

Despite his impressive list of ac-
complishments that coincide with a
busy schedule, Milani says he likes
to visit ofﬁces throughout the WPU
just to see how things are going. ,

“He does his rounds all through-
out the Union,’f said Michael Nites,
former Allocations Committee Chair
and current SGB member. “He’ll

_ walk in and just be like, ‘Where’s

Mike at?’ Then walk to the back,
and we’ll have a chat.”

Nites says these chats generally
start as business, but often diverge
into casually catching up.

“Usually, we end in chatting
about his daughter or how I’m do-
ing in school,” N ites said.

Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett’s
ofﬁce announced on Friday that
the UK—based Camelot Global Ser-
vices has won a contract to manage
the Pennsylvania State Lottery.

The corporation has promised
more than $34 billion in proﬁts
during the 20-year period of the
contract. The plan, however, has
drawn criticism from state legis-
lators, who say they were not in-
volved in the process. The Ameri-
can Federation of State, County
and Municipal Employees, the
union that represents most Penn-
sylvania lottery workers, has also
protested the deal, expressing con-
cerns about transparency and their
job security.

Jay Pagni, a spokesman for the
Governor’s Budget Oﬂice, said the
ofﬁce made the decision to look for
outside management last April in
response to a report issued by the
Pennsylvania Senate Budget and
Finance Committee.

According to the report, the
state’s population aged 60 and
over —— which was then around
17 percent — was projected to
grow to, 25 percent over the next
15 years. With a growing demand
for senior programs, for which
Pagni said the lottery proﬁts pro-
vide 75 percent of the funding, the
current lottery would be unable to
provide the needed revenue. The

state also could no longer afford slump years

_ in lottery revenue.

“At that point, we said, ‘OK. We have to
ﬁgure out how to increase the proﬁts,”’ Pagni
said. “Not only to increase the proﬁts, but
to make them stable.”

Initially, Camelot and two other com-
panies, Rhode Island—based GTECH and
Australia-based Tatts Group, all signed con-
ﬁdentiality agreements and kept their bids
closed. This, he explained, would prevent
the process from turning into a bidding war.

The other two bidders eventually
dropped out. One factor that was key to
Camelot’s ability to see the process through
was that it was willing to put up $150 million
in security, Pagni said. "

Camelot couldn’t be reached for com-
ment.

Elizabeth Brassell of the Pennsylvania
Department of Revenue added that the
company offered a letter of credit worth
an additional $50 million as part of the same
security. These sums will serve as collateral

if it fails to meet the annual minimum of 27
percent of lottery revenue going to senior
programs.

The proposal also included the addition
of the game Keno, which Brassell said will
provide an estimated $200 million in ad-
ditional proﬁts.

Brassell is uncertain when the plan will
take effect, saying that various offices of the
Corbett administration were reviewing the
contract. If it receives their approval, the
contract will go to the state attorney general.

However, AFSCME Council 13, the union
to which 175 of the state’s 220 lottery work-
ers belong, has argued that the state’s lottery
does not need the change in management.

Dave Fillman, the union’s executive di-
rector, said,,the organization has issued
a counter-proposal in which it promised
that it could return higher proﬁts to senior
programs. He pointed out that under state
management, the lottery currently puts 29.9
percent into the programs, and that the lot-
tery is already the ﬁfth-largest and one ‘of
the top 10 most efficient in the U.S.

Fillman said that AFSCME — along with
seven Democratic state legislators — has
ﬁled a lawsuit in the Commonwealth Court.

ties of Student Life, I“ had to learn from the
literal source of the information,” Gayman
said in an email. “More importantly, I real-
ized how much Terry cares about mentoring
and investing in students. Every time that we
would meet, his ﬁrst question would be, ‘Are
you keeping up with the books?”’

Nites can relate to this sentiment.

“That’s a very Terry thing to say,” he said.

Director of Student Life Kenyon Bonner
said that Milani is an integral part of Pitt his-
tory and has an important wealth of institu-
tional knowledge. ‘

“Terry is a great resource for students and
staff and provides us with unique institutional
memory from which we have beneﬁted in
many ways,” Bonner said. v

The suit contends that Keno, which would
be played in bars and restaurants across the
state as participants watched a TV monitor,
more closely resembles a gambling activity
than a state lottery.

According to Fillman, the governor did
not have authority to implement such a game
as part of the state’s lottery.

“[Governor Corbett] thinks he has the
right to bring Keno into bars and restaurants

across the state,” Fillman said. “We’re saying i

we can do that, but it has to happen [at the
legislative level].”

Fillman believed‘ that with additional
money from Keno, the current manage-
ment of the state lottery could compete with
Camelot’s offer.

Brassell disagreedwith the grounds of
the suit. She explained that Keno is classi-
ﬁed-as a “terminal-based game,” which are
standard in state lotteries.

Though Fillman said that the state named ’

Camelot as a bidder last November and an-
nounced the agreement with the company
on Friday, he believed that the state withheld
information about its plans.

“This thing has lacked transparency
since thevery beginning,” he said.‘

- Though he has a long reputation of service
to the school, Milani doesn’t like talking about
his past accomplishments. He earned a Ph._D.
in higher education from Pitt in 1979,‘ but it
doesn’t say thatnext to his online contact
information. '

“You don’t need to call me doctor,” Milani A

said. “I know I have my Ph.D.”

Milani said he tries to be as approachable
as possible while working to “make /student
life enjoyable.” That mission touches every-
thing that Milani does as overseer of the
Student Activities Fund and director of the
Student Volunteer Outreach.

“As long as it’s legal,” Milani said, “Our
thing is helping students do what they want
to do.” V '

Pagni said the Corbett administration
could not disclose a conﬁdential bidder
because it would have violated the Penn-
sylvania procurement code. He contended
that the Corbett administration had done its
best to disclose any information it couldas
early’ as possible. .

A The budget ofﬁce reviewed AFSCME 13’s
proposal, but rejected it. Pagni explained
that the union proposed to build up to $500
million in security. But, unlike Camelot,
which already had the money, the union
intended to accumulate the funds by taking
it from programs. .

Sen. John Wozniak, D-Cambria,;who
graduated from Pitt’s Johnstown campus
in 1978 with an economics degree, attended
the hearing Monday. .

He said he is one of the legislators in-
volved in the suit to prevent the contract
because of his concerns about making a
decision that involves such a large amount
of money so quickly. He stressed that he
was not necessarily opposed to the deal,
but wanted to ensure that it was right for
the state.

“I’mjust trying to slow the process down
' a little,” Wozniak said. I T ‘ ’

Sometimes that meanshelping clubs work

standards. Other times that means helping

his job description; . p _

“Its not like I put [a sign] up. there: ‘Come
talk to Terry for 20 minutes one-on- one about
service,’” Milani said. “But if a student comes
into my office lost, I do my best to help them.”

According to Bonner, Milani has spent the
past 40 years leaving a sizable mark on Pitt
for the better. ' .

“Over these 40 years, Terry has played
a major role in shaping student life at Pitt
as wellas our students’ impact on the local
community,” Bonner said. I

Bottle ban: why Pitt should eradicate

Rosie McKinley I
Columnist

Micah Toll was nominated for

A College Entrepreneur of the Year

in 2011 when he partnered with
two other engineering students to
create a hybrid electric-powered
bicycle that would enable students
to conquer the rugged terrain of
Pitt’s campus. Toll, who turned 22 a
year later, said he had known since

' he was 5 years old that mechanical

engineering would be his major.
Five months before his graduation,
he stated that he had no plans for
conventional employment and was
very committed to seeing his elec-

-tric bike company succeed.

As a society, we undoubtedly
need people like Toll in our schools.
When imaginative and innovative
people pass through schools like
Pitt’s Swanson School of Engineer-
ing and acquire a working knowl-
edge of in-demand STEM ﬁelds,
it often results in bursts of new
technology and procedures that
continually make our lives easier
and our work more productive.

This constant churning out of
problem-solving technology is
what‘ greases the economic wheel
and keeps it spinning smoothly.

This is the reason why, when stud-
ies began to show that about 40
percent of college students who
were planning on pursuing STEM
ﬁelds when entering college were
ditching the wagon, there was
cause for concern. a

In the fall of 2010, President
Barack Obama held the ﬁrst—ever
White House Science Fair, at which
he encouraged middle school pu-
pils to develop a love of science.
It would be the beginning of his
push to promote STEM education,
which included challenging col-
leges to graduate 10,000 more en-
gineers a' year and hire 100,000
new teachers with STEM teaching
degrees.

However, away from the po-
litical sphere, many students
couldn’t handle the abrupt change
from happily constructing a solar
system out of cardboard in high
school to memorizing grueling for-
mulas and attempting to beat the
curve in college. For many reasons,
numerous STEM majors ﬁnd them-
selves switching to the humanities
before their college career is over.

It is possible for a student to leave a phys-
ics class and do badly in a literature class
because they can’t write.

And though, on average, grades seem

i to be a little lower in the STEM ﬁelds than
those in the humanities, the incentivization

factor for STEM majors to migrate is mini-
mal, in my opinion, given the large number
of people the numbers suggest are moving.
There is some sort of existing incentive at
play, but the relatively higher grades in the

humanities are not the beneﬁt causing the
move, because nothing guarantees that
STEM students will pass if they switch.

Perhaps the biggest incentive that is driv-
ing STEM students to leave their ﬁelds is that
a discrepancy exists somewhere in the per-
ceived payoff of such ﬁelds. On a macrolevel,
a society beneﬁts when people graduate
with STEM degrees. But are these students
convinced of the reciprocal effect? Do they
feel they are being rewarded enough on a
micro level for the grueling preparations it
takes to get those degrees?

A 2011 CNN article showed that in that

bers suggest are moving. There is some sort
of existing incentive at play, but the rela-
tively higher grades in the humanities are
not the beneﬁt causing the move, because
nothing guarantees that STEM students will

Perhaps the biggest incentive that is driv-

ing STEM students to leavetheir ﬁelds is that
a discrepancy exists somewhere in the per-
ceived payoff of such ﬁelds. On a macro level,
a society beneﬁts when people graduate
with STEM degrees. But are these students
convinced of the reciprocal effect? Do they
feel they are being rewarded enough on a
micro level for the grueling preparations it
takes to get those degrees?. _

FILM REVIEW

Stylish mob film focuses more on humor than gangsters

“Gcmgs’rergSquod”
Directed by: Ruben
Fleischer

Starring: Sean Penn,
Ryan Gosling, Emma
Stone

Grode:B

Quinn Keaney
Staff W'rz'ter

Five cops team up to take down the Los
Angeles mob, and for once, it’s quite
funny.

With a talented cast including Josh
Brolin, Ryan Gosling, Sean Penn and
Emma Stone, Ruben Fleischer’s exces-
sively violent L.AA.—mob-versus-cops
melodrama should soar. But alas, quality
acting isn’t enough to cover up the film’s
subpar writing and underdeveloped char-
acters. Despite this, “Gangster Squad” is
sensationally stylish and ultimately very
entertaining.

It’s glaringly‘ clear from the film’s
opening scene that Fleischer is trying
to make some kind ofimpression, giving
viewers a gag-worthy shot of ruthless
mob king Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn) hav-

  IMPULSE

ing his goons pull a chained—up Chicago

mob informant in half with two cars driv-
ing in opposite directions behind the
“Hollywoodland” sign (now, simply the
iconic “Hollywood”). But by the conclu-
sion of the film, it’s not really clear what
that impression is. It’s safe to say that try
as he might, Fleischer’s “Gangster Squad-”‘

is rafar cry from-,this -decade’s version of :
‘‘'ITl1‘e_..Untouchables,?’la 1987 film with a.

- Cohen runs 1949 L.A. in the most c,or—_ _,
rupt way possible, paying offcops, judges -

gambling and prostitutes. With a ne.w‘idea”
thatwill put Cohen:/in c'ontrol'o‘f"every~

wire bet on the West Coast, it looks like
he can’t — and won’t — be stopped.
Despite his seemingly ironclad protec-
tion from the law, World War II veteran
and LAPD Sgt.]ohnVO’Mara (Josh Brolin)
is determined to take Cohen down. Street-

hen’s operation down, the depth just isn’t
there. The characters are played by some
of the best actors around right now, but
with such shallow material, they don’t
have much to work with.

They go through the motions pleas-
antly and unshockingly, and the only sup-
porting character in the ﬁlm who actually
dies is so predictable that it leaves the
viewer wondering if any thought was put
into the script at all. Ryan Gosling starts
up a secret dalliance with Cohen’s girl,
Grace Faraday (Emma Stone), but com-
pared to the actors’ white-hot chemistry
in the rom-com “Crazy, Stupid, Love.,”
they barely sizzle this time around.

More like a fantasy of “L.A. Noire”
than an actual attempt to recreate it,
“Gangster Squad” is mindless, pulpy and
fun. While lovers of the genre will find
it laughable, it at least gives everyone a
chance to once again appreciate how good
Ryan Gosling looks in a suit. I

A$AP Rocky

Grode:iA-

Rocks like: An impossibly
relevcmtiporty ploylist

Jeff‘ Ihaza A A
Staff _lWrz'ter

The ﬁrst words we hear from Rakim Mayers

_  more publicly:kno.wn;as A$AP Rocky -4- on

hisdebut album, Lo_‘tzg.Li1_7é.A$AP, come as an
inspirational decree,4as well as a testament

to where music, especially hip-hop,  during

thisvmoment in its history. ‘  :
“I thought I’d probly die in prison,” Rocky
declares in his characteristic Houston-in-

spired twang on the album’s ﬁrst and title~

track. This edict, in addition to the song’s
arresting drum loop, make for an intro as
hypnotic as “Palace,” a song off Rocky’s debut
mixtape, LiVe.Love.A$AP. On the new track,
Rocky also sings the bridge, which provides
a sharp contrast from Rocky’s verses and
somehow works, forcing listeners to sing
alongwith him, doing their best Frank Ocean
impressions.

His verse’s sentiment is fascinating. Rocky
was completely unknown a little over a year
ago; his debut mixtape Live.Love.A$AP at-
tracted the attention of hip-hop heavyweight
Drake, and, similarly to most relevant rappers
of this era, the newcomer quickly garnered
an Internet cult following.

On his debut album,A$AP Rocky mixes lyrics with other artists to create great tracks.

Rocky Welcomes listeners through inspirational album

Rocky’s ﬁxed position at the intersection
of Internet rap and the mainstream (he’s ru-
mored to have “hooked up” with Rihanna)
comes as a result of his impeccable taste.
A$AP’s detractors point to his lack of Kend-
rick Lamar-like lyrical tenacity, completely
missing his wholly unique ability to curate a
music exhibit of sorts, using his own rap to
tie it together.

Take the unlikely collaboration with Skril-
lex on “Wild for the Night,” which Rocky
performed on The Late Show with David
Letterman earlier this week. The song is the
ﬁrst legitimate electronic dance music-hip-
hop crossover —- mainly because there isn’t
a moment that feels forced. Rocky claims
that Skrillex is his friend, and the pair share
a chemistry on the track that even Kanye
couldn’t replicate in his various EDM en-
deavors.

Perhaps the album’s crowning moment

comes on “1 Train,” a posse cut featuring '

just about everyone who really matters in
hip—hop. This isn’t a song like “Mercy,” where
you have to wade through Big Sean rambling
about nonsense to get to a 2 Chainz verse that
is only ironically enjoyable. Instead, Rocky
pulls together the likes of Danny Brown,
Yelawolf, Action Bronson, Joey Bada$$ and
Kendrick Lamar to build a stream-of-con-
sciousness superverse that should go down
as one of the best rap collaborations to date.

The album as a whole feels like hanging
out with Rocky for a day, meeting all the cool
people he is somehow friends with and maybe
having lunch with Grimes before linking up
with Schoolboy Q.

Much like the changing nature of hip—hop,

Rocky is completely welcoming to outsiders.

As he says on the album’s ﬁnal track, “Sud—
denly,” “You my brother, you my kin, f*ck the
color of your skin.” 21:3’

Given that viewers are well aware of the end-
ing, the movie is hardly suspenseﬁil. But “Zero

struggled to overcome, and it does not hold
back in doing so. a,

The many torture scenes in “Zero Dark Thir-

jarring in the right way. ~

Many critics —- government—aﬁiliated an
otherwise — have attacked the ﬁlm for endors-
ing the use of t0I111t'e as an effective means of
achieving homeland security goals. Bigelow,
however, defends the torture scenes, insisting
that the movie isn’t meant to suggest that bin
Laden would not have been captured without
the depicted interrogation techniques, nor that
torture was the most important part of the pro-
cess. “Zero Dark Thirty” asserts her commit-
ment to the accurate portrayal of history, not
her political ideologies.

In a recent interview with NME Radio, David
Bowie’s longtime producer, Tony Visconti, told
the magazine that the artist formerly known as
Ziggy Stardust would not be playing any live
shows in orderto promote his upcoming album,
T/ye Nexi Dqy. According to Visconti, Bowie
is “fairly adamant he’s never gonna perform
live again.”

This will likely come as a disappointment to
any die—hard fans who hope to have one more
chance to see the thin white duke onstage in
all his glory. Perhaps they were hoping that
he’d team up with The Rolling Stones to form
some sort of music legends of yore tour. Or
perhaps Eddie Van Halen could have shown
up as a surprise guest.

The whole thing could have turned into a
nostalgia-fest forthe ages. Aging crowds would
gather in every city in order to catch a glimpse of
Mickjagger and Bowie doing an arthritic rendi-
tion of “Dancing in the Street.” Fifty—something
parents would pack arenas in tattered T-shirts
from their youths in order to cheer for the artists
and express their shock at how energetic Bowie
is for a man of his age.

Bowie is throwing all of those opportunities
away, and I would like to personally thank him
for doing so.

Nostalgic comeback tours have longbeen a
trend in the landscape of pop music, and they
make sense for a number of reasons. Groups
such as The Rolling Stones have a massive cata-
log ofbrilliant music and an older fan base will-
ing to shell out cash to see them perform. The
fans are drawn to these bands for a chance to
hear their favorite songs live once again and
to relive the days when their generation was
making the cutting-edge music of the era. It’s
awin—win situation for both parties. Nostalgia
is a natural response to changes in the musical
landscape, and it only seems reasonable to try
to relive the best moments of an artist’s career.

But as a younger fan of many bands that are
now deemed classic rock, I ﬁnd the comeback
tour phenomenon depressing. Perhaps it’s be-
cause I wasn’t there the ﬁrst time around, or
perhaps it’s because I’m living my glory days,
so I don’t have to yearn for them, but I ﬁnd
myselfwishing that the now-old_ Bob Dylans
of the world would stop putting out Christmas
albums and going on tour. For such artists, the
money that comes in for music production may

just be too good, or it’s difficult to admit when
they’ve lost it.

For Dylan, putting out Christmas In The a

Heart, a painful collection of Christmas covers,
should have been the moment of clarity. It con-
sisted of a collection of animatronic backup vo-

Chastain would be the ﬁlm’s powerﬁﬂ standout

Her delivery convincingly illustrates Maya’s
signiﬁcance among the countless exasperated

Even so, I have friends who ﬁnd themselves
looking forward to the next time Van Halen or
the only surviving members ofThe Who come to
town. They pay exorbitant prices for a chance to
see signature artists of past eras that they didn’t
live. But for those who did grow up as The Who
put out the best portion of their discography, .
this concept doesn’t seem wholly unreasonable.

It might make more sense for someone my_
age to spend their hard-earned money on music
produced by the bands and artists thatwill come
to deﬁne this era of music. To be quite honest,
I don’t really know who these bands will be.
Radiohead could be a contender, but it seems
rather contrived to point to one band or another.

There are talented young artists who have
yet to be established that will put on a better
show and have yet to write their best songs.
Instead of being nostalgic for an era you never

one has to offer?

MEN’S BASKETBALL

Panthers pull away from Villanova to earn second Big East Win

‘In Sepich
Sports Editor

It wasn’t pretty, but the Pitt
men’s basketball team earned a
much-needed win at Villanova
on Wednesday night.

After struggling offensively
for much of the contest, the
Panthers (14-4, 2-3 Big East) got
hot at the right time to end the
game on a 15-0 run and defeat
the Wildcats (11-6, 2-2 Big East)
at The Pavilion in Philadelphia,
58-43.

Pitt got an emotional boost
after learning that senior point
guard Tray Woodall would play,
despite sitting out most of the
previous game after suffering a
concussion. The team’s leader
ended the contest with eight
points, five assists and five re-
bounds.

In the game’s early stages,
Pitt continued a worrying trend
by failing to knock down free

throws. Redshirt junior forward .

Dante Taylor both made 1 of 2
foul shots, which matched the
dismal 50-percent mark from
the charity stripe that plagued
the Panthers in their overtime
loss to Marquette last Saturday.

Shots just weren’t falling for
either team, as the opponents
combined for just one made field
goal — earned by the Wildcats

—~ in the opening five minutes. '

The only player consistently
finding the net was Villanova
guard Darrun Hilliard, who
made his first three shots —
all 3-pointers — to give the
Wildcats a 13-10 lead halfway
through the first period.

But the Panthers’ offense

woke up and responded with
a 9--0 run, sparked by a layup
fromjunior guard Trey Zeigler,
a 3-pointer by redshirt sopho-
more Durand Johnson, a hook
shotby freshman center Steven
Adams and ‘two free throws by
Zanna.

Then, the momentum quickly
shifted in the Wildcats’ favor.

Villanova ended the first half
on an 8-0 run to take a 23-22
lead at intermission, with 14 of
its 23 points coming from Hill-
iard.

Johnson led Pitt with six
points off the bench in a sloppy,
defensive first half that saw both
teams record more turnovers
than made field goals.

Coming out of the locker
room, the Pitt offense struggled
like it had at the beginning of
the first half.

The Wildcats began the sec-
ond period on a 9-3 run, which
meant Villanova had out-scored
Pitt 17-3 since the Panthers led
22-15 back in the first half.

. With his team down by seven, .

Johnson kept Pitt in the game,
scoring the next five points. Zei-
gler then converted a mid-range
jump shot to level the score at
32.

The teams traded blows for
most of the remainder of the
second half, with neither squad
leading by more than three
points. .

With three minutes remain-
ing and the score tied at 43, Zei-
gler found Adams on a broken
play, and the freshman center
ﬂushed home a slam to give the
Panthers a lead they wouldn’t
relinquish. Villanova didn’t even
score again.

Zeigler, who had his best
game as a Panther since trans-
ferring from Central Michigan in
the summer, then scored back-
to-back buckets-. He finished
tied for a team-high 13 points
and grabbed six rebounds,
which was close to what he av-
eraged last season with the Chip-
pewas. Johnson also recorded
13 points off the bench for Pitt.

Johnson, Zeigler and the

 
   

rest of the Panthers’ reserves
played an important role in the
crucial away victory, combining
for more than half (31) of Pitt’s
points.

‘Villanova missed its final.

fouled Pitt players after each
miss as Adams, Zeigler, Woodall

out with converted foul shots.

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL

 St. John’s defense stifles Panthers offense in blowout victory

Dave Uhrmacher
Stqff Writer

The Pitt women’s basketball

team dropped its thirdstraight

Big East game of the season on
Wednesday night at Carnesecca
"Arena in Queens, N.Y., extend-

ing a conference losing streak
dating back to Feb. 15, 2011, to
21 games. The Panthers dropped
the contest to a previously
ranked St. John’s squad, 61-32,
falling to 0-3 in conference play
this season and 9-7 overall.

The Panthers struggled with
shooting all night, making 12 of

59 (20.3 percent) shots from the
field and a measly 2 of 9 (22.2
percent) from beyond the are. On
a night the Panthers held the op-
posing team to only 20 percent
shooting from 3-point range,
they struggled to stop the Red
Storm from other spots on the
ﬂoor. St. John’s shot 42 percent

from the field as a team.

The lone bright spot for Pitt in
this game was redshirt freshman
guard Loliya Briggs’ 10-point
performance. She converted
on three of her 10 ﬁeld—goal at-

tempts in the game — including .

one 3-pointer -— and went 3-for-
4 from the free-throw line.

St.John’s (9-6, 3-0 Big East)
certainly lived up to its billing
as a preseason squad ranked
nationally in the top 15 by the
USA Today Coaches Poll’. Senior
forward Shenneika Smith led the
Red Storm’s offensive attack,

GABLER STYLE

Pitt shouldn't worry about Dixon leaving anytime soon

Dustin Gabler
Senior Staff Wrz'ter

On Monday, the University of Southern Cali-
fornia announced it had relieved its bagketball
head coach of his duties, and, once again, Pitt
head coachjamie Dixon’s name was one of the
ﬁrst off the tongue — or keyboard —- of many
college basketball reporters. 9

But let’s be perfectly clear from the get—go,
there has been no actual evidence that Dixon
is even remotely interested in the USC job.

In fact, the only evidence that exists says he
wouldn’t be interested. Now in his 14th season
at Pitt -— 10th as the head coach — Dixon has
turned down a variety of jobs with plenty of
intriguing qualities. ' I

The ﬁrst of these is money. In 2010, both
Oregon and DePaul began making calls to big-
time coaching targets all but ready to sign a

. blank check. Both schools became fascinated

with Dixon. . .
Oregon, along with then Nike CEO Phil
Knight, offered a huge sum of money, inﬁnite
uniform combinations and an oddly designed
court to lure Dixon to the Beaver State.
DePaul, the Big East’s annual doormat, de-
cided it wanted to buy a team and went search-

I ing for a great coach. It settled on Dixon and
 linked _him to the opening in Chicago.

Instead of taking either of those offers,
Dixon signed an extension that put his salary
at approximately $1.6 million per season. Ac-
cording to Pitt’s athletic director, Steve Peder-
son, Dixon didn’t even consult him aboﬂthe
extension andraise. V 

“Jamie has never come to us,” Pedéifson
said. “He has never asked for anything‘? We
went to him and told him that we’d like him to
be the coach -here for a long time and continue
to work with him to build what’s become one
of the elite programs in college basketball.”

Exactly a week later, DePaul hired ex-
Clemson coach Oliver Purnell, who has had
much less success than Dixon, for north of
$2.1 million per year.

Dixonalso turned down Arizona, a school
with much more tradition than Pitt, in 2009.

Almost everyone but the man himselfhas
said that Dixonvdesires to return to his home
state of California. His parents still live there

and his wife, originally from Hawaii, is a USC '

graduate. With all of that said, Dixon turned
down USC in 2009. I S '

“I know how good I’ve got it at Pitt,” Dixon
said in 2o1o_.“I’m not going anywhere. This is
where Iwant tobe, afndthis is where I always
hoped to be,‘ I’m' happy to be at Pitt. I’m the
luckiest guy in the world, and I recognize it
evefy day.” ' A . ' A  -

Dan Fisher
Europe before becoming a coach. Courtesy
Concordia Athletics

played professionaiiy in

tit1e—winning campaign, the Eagles ﬁnished

the 2011 season as runners—up, and Fisher
was named NAIA Coach of the Year. In 2012,
the Eagles compiled a perfect_ record and
Fisher was once again honored with the
Coach of the Year designation. ’

The Pitt athletic administration. is look-
ing forward to the culture of winning that it
believes Fisher will bring to a Pitt volleyball
program that has made the Big East Tourna-
ment for the -past ﬁve years.

“We are very excited to welcome Dan Fish-
er to Pitt tolead our volleyball program,” said
Steve Pederson, Pitt’s athletic director. “Dan
has a proven track record as a winner and
brings a unique set of skills and background
to this position. Volleyball is important to
Pitt, and we were committed to ﬁnding a

coach to build upon the history and traditions

of this program. I am grateful to [Executive
Associate Athletic Director] Donna Satnft,
who led the search, and excited that it con-
cluded. with such a terriﬁc coach. We look
forward to working with Coach Fisher to help
him achieve great thingslat Pitt.”

Sanft agreed with Pederson and noted
that Fisher’s leadership skills will allow him
to impact his players both on and off the
court.

“Dan is a great ﬁt at this University,” Sanft
said. “He has been a winner at every level
as a player and a coach. He is.a great leader
who has high aspirations for our players,
athletically and academically. We are excited
for the future of Pitt volleyball with Dan as
our head coach.”

No Pitt players could be reached for com-
ment.

In addition to a successful two seasons at
Concordia -University, Fisher also has experi-
ence in coaching at the University of Hawaii.
From 2009 to 2011, he served as the associate
men’s-head coach and helped the teaht earn
a No. 4 national ranking in 2010.

Fisher was also able to. achieve coach-
ing success at the professional level. Injuly

' of 2012, he was an assistant coach for the

women’s gold medal—winning U.S. national
Pan—American Cup team. Fisher’s primary
duties were working with the team’s setters
and planning offensive systems and tactics.

His volleyball knowledge stems from his
time playing at the University of the Paciﬁc

— as well as ﬁve years spent playing profession-

ally in Belgium, Spain and Switzerland.-He
also spent ﬁve years on the AVP Professional
Beach Volleyball Tour.

Fisher was initially impressed with the
Pitt program and sees the atmosphere as one
in which he can succeed, both in Volleyball
and on a personal level. .

“It became clear to me throughout the
interview process what a special place Pitt is,”
Fisher said. “From my wife and my daughter,
we are all excited to make this move. I want
to thank Steve Pederson and Donna Sanft for
the work they did to make us feel at home.”

‘ the deal later fell through for a variety of
reasons, but at the time was an improvement‘
for both parties. He obviously still cares about
his alma mater.

However, like every other potential suitor,
TCU joined the large scrapheap of schools that
has failed to lure Dixon away from Pitt.

USC fans will argue that Dixon didn’t want
the job in 2009 because the Trojans were under
NCAA sanctions. But even this past Monday,

Dixon said when his name comes up for other
jobs that it is something he doesn’t even think
about. - ‘

I “I don’t really talk about that,” Dixon said.

_ “Fourteen years here, and I’ve never talked

about it. I guess its just part of it. It’s just part
of the game, I guess. I’m kind of used to it. It’s
just something we don’t really talk about or
think about too much.” '

There’s no true rebuttal to that yet. We
haven’t seen Dixon turn down a program sim-
ply because it has received NCAA sanctions.

' After the USC job is ﬁlled, we will be able to

cross another circumstance off’ our lists.

When an elite job comes along —— and I
mean truly elite — then Pitt fans can worry
about their_ coach. His success has earned him
the chance to be mentioned for the true blue
bloods of college basketball. ,

So unless Duke, Kansas, Kentucky or Indi-
ana comes calling, I feel comfortable saying
Dixon will be the head coach at Pitt for his 11th

. season come next October. Q

recording 14 points and nine rebounds.
Freshman forward Aliyyah Handford also
chipped in 11 points and six rebounds in
the victory.

An almost insurmountable lead was
built by halftime in favor of the Red
Storm, which amassed a 33-11 lopsided
score that reflected the Panthers’ poor
shooting night. Fifteen turnovers, 10 of
those coming in the first half, led to a .5
assist—to-turnover ratio, a season low for
the Panthers.

Though they lack size in the frontcourt,
the Red Storm managed to out—rebound
the Panthers by a 48-38 margin. St. John’s
also outscored Pitt in the paint 26-10 over
the course of the game.

The Panthers featured a different start-
ing lineup than normal on this night, with
sophomore forward Cora McManus mak-
ing her first career start. Junior forward
Asia Logan joined McManus in the front-
court, while freshman guards Brittany
Gordon and Loliya Briggs joined sopho-
more Brianna Kiesel in the backcourt.

After the game, Pitt head coach Agnus
Berenato was not pleased with her team’s
performance.

“When Kiesel does not score for us, we
take a step back,” Coach Berenato said.
“Asia was out of sorts tonight. She can’t
go 2—for-14. Turnovers, too — we had 10
in the first half, 15 total, and 12 of those

CORNER OF ATWOOD & BATES l 412.681.5656 3 MADMEXJSOM

came from our guards. It was our guard
play tonight, we couldn’t get the ball down
low. And now we just have to go back to
the drawing board. You can’t win games
shooting 20 percent, at any level.”

Berenato also commented on how she
did not see this disappointing loss com-
ing, following a great week of practice
and preparation by Pitt.

“We are in the best conference in the
country right now,” she said. “This year,
this is the best conference in the nation,
and we had some of our best practices and
a great shootaround prior to this game. We
started two freshmen, two sophomores
and ajunior. But it is very disappoint—
ing the way we came out and started this
game. I did not see this coming. We were
really ready for this game. But you have
to come to play in the Big East.”

Pitt will have plenty more opportuni-
ties this season to get a coveted BigaEast
victory with a two-game homestand ap-
proaching. Its next chance will come on
Saturday when the Panthers host Mar-
quette at 3 p.m. The game is scheduled
to start soon after the conclusion of the
men’s basketball game versus Connecticut
at the Petersen Events Center.

The Panthers will also have the op-
portunity to play No. 2 Notre Dame at
the Pete Wednesday, Jan. 23, at 7 p.m.
