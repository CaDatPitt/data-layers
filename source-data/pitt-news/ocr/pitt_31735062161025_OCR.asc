Foreign student loses $4,000 to con artists

By Erik Kridle
Asst. News Editor

Last week a foreign female Pitt student
lost $4,000 because she trusted a team of
con artists, according to Pitt police.

Detective Francis Walsh of ‘ the
Department of Public Safety said the victim

was walking along Bellefield Avenue when A

she was approached by two black females
carrying a sealed envelope which they
claimed contained money. They said they
had just found it on the street but hadn’t

‘ counted it yet.

The victim was then asked to hold the
fénvelope for a short time while the two
women performed “some I necessary”

errands. She was told that if she held the
envelope for a time, when the two women
returned, all three would divide up the
alleged money equally. The only stipulation
was that the student had to give the
women some of her own money.

“To ensure that the Pitt student wouldn’t
run off with the envelope of money, she
was asked to go to the bank, withdraw all
of her money, and give it to the women,”

said Walsh. “They told her that they would ,
‘return it when they came back for the

envelope. They didn’t.”

When the women hadn’t returned for
several hours, the victim grew suspicious
and opened the envelope to ﬁnd it filled
with worthless blank paper. The two

women got away with paper money

“‘Bunko artists’ prey mostly on new or
foreign students,” says Walsh. “T hey’ll
take money from anyone who is gullible
enough to believe their stories.”

According to Walsh,las_t week's incident
isknown as the -“bait and switch” technique
to law enforcement agencies, and it’s not
at all a rare occurrence.

“Beware also those who try to sell you

More often than not there will be something
wrong with the merchandise,” he warned.

Chinese Pitt students last year. However,

he says, he is not aware of any so far this

fall. _
“Sometimes a Chinese student will bring
up his experience at a meeting and warn‘
his fellow students,” hesays, “but mostly
it’s talked about on a personal basis.” _
Bing, who was robbed at gun—point
three years ago by an apparent street
panhandler, makes it a practice of giving
some change when asked for money in

hopes that the asker won’t take more

drastic measures.

“I know many other Chinese students
who do the same,” says Bing." I

’Street wit’ is focus  
of   self-defense class

By Jenifer Crook
Staff Writer .

If caught in a dangerous street
situation, even a split-second
delay in taking defensive action

could be a costly mistake, right?

At least that’s what many people
believe. ' i

But according to Curtis Smith,
‘.’itt’s self-defense. instructor, that
belief isn’t a true one.

In fact, Smith, who developed‘
the recently published “Buy
Yourself a Minute” self—defense
method, says those extra seconds
a person takes to evaluate his
situation may be the smartest
move he can make. I ‘

“A person "needs to take the
time torealize what kind of action
to take,” says Smith. A ’ ‘

“Your best weapon in danger

I is lookingalert, like you know

what’s going on. Try to diffuse an

altercation  talking, being"

aggressive and saying no to a
possible attacker,” added Smith,
who is also active with Pitt’s
Department of Public Safety.
Smith’s method, commonly
called BYAM, focuses on
acquiring “street wit,” which
means becoming more aware of
your surroundings. Smith says
that too often, Pitt students aren’t

alert enough when walking
Oakland streets. ,
“A lot of Pitt students come

A from rural areas, and they don’t

really know what’s going on,
especially freshmen. They don’t
realize that even a person just
asking them for the time can "turn
into an assault. ”‘

. According to Smith, criminals

are searching for people who
look confused or “too polite to
say no” to be their victims.

That’s why he thinks it’s
important for students to take a
self-defense class, where they’ll
learn how to avoid being an easy
target.

Smith says the BYAM method V

is superior to others currently
taught, because the course uses a
textbook along with the standard
drills. «

“Most instructors just slapin a
video tape and say, ‘OK, that's
your training film.’ That’s where
they fall short. In my class,
students get the benefit of

' cognitive learning through the

book. I actually take them through
all the phases of self—defense, so
they see it, read it, write it, and
get placed in simulated assault
situations.” I

Local protester is ignored by CMU Campus Police

By Brendan Kevenides
Staff Writer C

During the summer, Carnegie
Mellon University pursued a
contract from the United States

% Army for a computer center to
research nuclear weapons
systems, and the university’s art
department made a change in its
curriculum. Tuesday, a small band
of politicalactivists showed their
disapproval of these changes.

he protesters were distressed

‘ that the university’s art department

decided to close down its glass
studio and the computer science

department chose to pursue the a

defense contract. They want CMU
to focus its curriculum on the
liberal arts rather than on technical
research. ’

Group leader Vincent Scotti
Eirene, ‘ who is wanted by
Pittsburgh police for skipping
bond after his arrest during a civil
disobedience rally in early August,
added, “This is a move by the

university from the fine arts to the
art of death.”

According to Kyle Fisher,
director of public relations at
CMU, the university is part of a
team of research institutions
which made a proposal to the
Army for a super computer center.
The center would be used to
research nuclear weapons, but
Fisher explained that CM U would
not be involved in that classified
research.

“It is the policy of CMU not to

partake in any classiﬁed research,”
she said. S
Due to this policy, the university
has turned down a possible
managerial role in the proposed
project. Fisher explained that
CMU’s participation would
involve researching non-classified
software techniques and solving
mathematical problems.

Other institutions involved in,

the project include West Virginia
University, the University of
Colorado and a San Diego

technical firm. Fisher said that

the center will probablybe located I

at the University of Colorado as
they take the managerial role.

Assistant head of the art
department Mary Schmidt
expressed disappointment that
the departrnent’s decision to
change its curriculum would be
met with animosity.

“We are excitedly looking
forward towards the art
department’s future," she said.

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, August 31. 1989

Pittsburgh's oldest park celebrates its centennial

By Pria Bhargava
Staff Writer “

“I beg to say thatl hope to meet
your views upon the project of a
Public Park for the citizens of
Pittsburgh.”

— Mary E. Schenley, in a

-note to Edward Bigelow n 1889.

Labor Day weekend will be
“Schenley Centennial Weekend, ”
with many activities, including
balloons, a concert and fireworks,
according to Louise Brown,
director of Citiparks. ‘‘It will be a
fun-filled event for all

Pittsburghers,” she said.

Schenley Park," the oldest park
in Pittsburgh, was the key to the
sudden transformation of

Oakland into a civic center. The ,

. dramatic effect

development of the park had a
upon the
somewhat rural community of
Oakland in the 1890s, according
to Robert Braughler, spokesman
for Citiparks.

“Oakland is now the state's
third—largest commerce [area],
after Philadelphia and Pittsburgh,”
Braughler added.

The park's admirers may not
know that a love affair of its
donor shocked not only the
whole country, but England's
Queen Victoria as well. When
Mary Elizabeth Croghan, aged 15
in 1842, eloped to England from
her boarding school with 43-year-
old Captain Edward W.I. Har-
rington Schenley, she created a
national scandal.

Mary’s father, Wil1iam_Croghan
Jr., is said to have fainted after

hearing the news and irnmedi-
ately appealed to the
Pennsylvania legislature to make
him guardian of her enormous
inheritance.

Schenley Park began as 500
acres of pasture and woods called
“Mount Airy Tract,” and was
owned by Mary’s maternal
grandfather, General James
O’Hara (1754-1819), who had
willed it to Mary. Upon her father’s

death, Mary won a battle in

Pennsylvania courts to control
her own estate. Her real estate
holdings in Pittsburgh at the time
of her own death were estimated
in excess of $50 million.

By the late 1870s, a “city
beautiful movement” began to
sweep across the United States
to place urban parks in bustling,
industrial metropolitan cities.

“(This movement brought about]
the Central Park project in New
York City, and then Boston, and
Chicago —— Pittsburgh wanted
one, but thought of themselves
as a minor league,” says
Braughler.

Edward Bigelow, the city’s first
director of the public works, -was
a persistent believer in the
movement. When he learned in
1889 that a real estate agent
planned to travel to London to
convince. Mrs. Schenley to sell
the land to building developers,
he sent an attorney to see her.
When the real estate agent arrived,
the attorney had already
convinced Mrs. Schenley to
donate the land to the city.

Thus, in 1889 Mary Schenley
gave the city 300 acres of Mt. Airy
Tract with an option to purchase

intimate paths, man-made
contrivances and striking natural
vistas. In the heart of what used
to be called the Civic Center,
Schenley Park contained 456 acres
of rolling terrain accommodating
60 ﬂower beds and 230 species of
plants so creatively arranged that
it became a city showplace.

Following Mrs. Schenley’s

 gift, the city accepted Andrew

Carnegie’s second offer of a li-
brary and music hall, and a site at
the entrance to the park was used
for the building, completed in
1895 and then enlarged in 1907.
Another keystone in the park’s
development was the building
of Phipps Conservatory in 1893.

Mrs. Schenley died in 1903 at

the age of 76, surviving her

husband by 26 years, but Schenley
Park had already had a dramatic
effect on Pittsburgh by the time
of her death. Bigelow had
lavished a tremendous amount
of formality upon the park by
building English gardens, French
boulevards, Italian sculpture and
exotic plants such as Japanese
ginkgo trees.

His only obstacle inlthe park’s
development had been
Pittsburgh’s air quality. Due to

' the coke ovens in Hazelwood,

large amounts of smoke blew
past Oakland and through the
park, affecting the quality of plant
life. Environmental growth was
impaired until after World War

_ II, when air pollution began to

 
 
   
  
 
 
 
 

be more controlled.

However, physical
development of Schenley Park
continued to flourish. Bigelow
excavated 14,000 cubic yards of
rock to create Flagstaff Hill as an
amphitheater for concerts and
eventually outdoor ﬁlm events.
A man-made lake was also created
in the ravine at Panther Hollow in
1909.

That same year Forbes Field
opened across the ravine from
Carnegie Technical Schools, now
known as Carnegie Mellon
University. Forbes Field was
home to the Pittsburgh Pirates for
more than 60 years.

Braughler says that Citiparks
hopes the Centennial Celebration
will create an awareness of the
wear and tear the park has gone
through and will prompt
donations for the park’s upkeep.

certainty some of the problems
you will bring to us during the

of other problems.

Our past experience also
makes us confident that the
vast majority of you who do
come to the center will receive
the help you need, while a
smaller number may need to
be referred elsewhere.

1989 will be- remembered as
the year of the “reunion” for a
slew of bands dating back to the
’60s and ’70s. The Who had
another ’last” tour, the members
of Yes reformed as Anderson,
Bruford, Wakeman and Howe
and, not to be outdone, the oldest
bad boys of rock “n’ roll have
also decided to overlook past
personal problems and join the

L crowd.
It has been several years since

the Stones have worked together. ’

Jagger, Richards and Wood have
_all been involved in other
‘projects, but now the Rolling

Stones will kick off their American
tour on Sept. 9 in support of their

latest release, Steel’ Wheels.

It seems as though the Rolling
Stones have weathered more rock
‘n’ roll hype than any band should
ever be expected to. There was
Altamont, which the Hell’s Angels
turned into a riot, there were the
accusations of Jagger’s sexual
escapades with a candy bar and
Marianne Faithful, there were the
drug busts and the groupies and
the fights between band members,
but it always came down to the
music.

that they’ve become cliched.) and
heapings of illicit substances that
catapulted the Stones to fame
and saw them through well over
two and a half decades together.

So saying that the blues had a
rock~bastard child and named it
the Rolling Stones is an
understatement. The offspring
was much more than a bastard
child, it was a seething musical
force that broke all levels of
debauchery that rock “idols” had

‘set before them.

4 turmoil

Never before had a band's inner
been more public.
Personal problems, as ,well as
feuds among band members,
always made the press and kept
fans wondering when the Stones
would ﬁnally announce a last
tour or LP. It was almost as if
conﬂict was the only way to keep
the Stones’ monopoly of the rock
scene alive.

But whether Richards was
battling his heroin addiction and

fighting with Jagger, or Jagger

0 N E S. S IE. E L, Ws1l».i.EE—L~S 

was harassing Wood for his drug
problems, there was one point
that all critics seemed to notice;
the band played its best when
their morale was at its worst. The
more the Stones fought, the more
it fueled their musical inspiration
and created fabulous on—stage
antics.

Evidently the Stones have
decided to overlook their past
differences for the sake of

preserving their musical style. 49+

THE PITI‘, NEWS, Thursday, August 31, 1989

By Dmitri Ragano
Assistant Showcase Editor

Casualties of W/arisyet another
tale about the moral dilemmas of
the Vietnam War. Based on a true
story published in TbeNew Yorleer
in 1969, the ﬁlm concerns an
American squad which abducts
and kills a Vietnamese girl.

Michael]. Fox plays Eriksson, a
“cherry” who has just arrived in
Vietnam. No sooner does he get
there than he has a brush with
death. Eriksson gets caught in a
Viet Cong trap and is rescued in
the nick of time by Sergeant
Meserve (Sean Penn). In a second
clash, seemingly ‘harmless

«gjyvillagers turn out to be treacherous

VC. These incidents breed a
deep hatred. and paranoia in the
_squad members.

Things really go awry on the
squad’s next mission. Under order
of Meserve, the squad kidnaps a
village girl for “portable R&R”

‘and’ “keeping morale up.”

Eriksson is the only one with
enough conscience and courage
to oppose the kidnapping. The
remaining hour or so of the film
is spent resolving the conﬂict
between him and the other
soldiers led by Meserve.

No war-is-hell film is going to
be light fare, but director Brian
DePalrna seems particularly intent
em forcing the viewer to cringe at
his film or reject it completely.
DePalma made his reputation
with creepy neo—Hitchcock
thrillers ( Carrie, Dressed to Kill,
Body Double). His subsequent
work in Scarface and the
commercial hit The Untouchables
reaffirmed his status as a master

of stylized violence.

T He packs a few mean visceral
punches into Casualties of War
—— I won’t give them away, but let
me say there aren’t enough of
them. For the most part, Casualties
5} War has a stark, ever-so
desolate tone. If there’s a climax
in this film, I sure as hell can't find
it.

It’s as if every scene had just
followed a spectacular battle —
yet we never get the spectacular
battle. The tension never rises or
releases and has no cathartic
power. Ennio Morricone’s layers
of somber vocals and strings never
Qt up, giving us yet another
unneeded reminder that this is
meant to be a serious film.

And while DePalma has visual
prowess to burn, he’s not so
brilliant when it comes to scripts.
The screenplay, written by
playwright and Vietnam vet David

, R-‘.833, is bogged down with self-

 righteousness. Instead of giving

us characters, he gives us villains
and innocents. If, as the film so
redundantly suggests, there is
indeed morality even in wartime,
must it come in the form of
Eriksson’s lofty, embarrassingly
dumb speeches? A scary,
fascinating true story is made into
a dull, dimensionless morality
tale. There’s no substance behind
the images.

As Sergeant Meserve, Sean Penn
makes the most of bad lines and
aone—dirnensional character. With
his inarticulate, world—weary
scowl he manages to bring a
certain Brando—like element of
tragedy to the part. It’s the most
palpable portrayal of evil since
Dennis Hopper’s antics in Blue

Velvet.

Michael]. Fox may never shake
that teenybopper image -—— this
movie sure won’t help. His
Eriksson is ill-conceived but raises
an interesting question about the
film’s social makeup: why is
Eriksson, the only good guy,
refined and L1pper—middle—c1ass
while the other morally inferior
members of the squad are played

M as poor and working class?

Vietnam was fought and paid A

for by the lower end of this
country’s economic totem pole,
yet Fox’s hero is inexplicably
white bread. When we notice

V that Fox’s pinup face, bright—eyed.
and completely devoid of facial

hair, resembles a young Dan
Quayle the character’s
authenticity gets even more

  

troubling. I hate to say it but
Eriksson isn't a far cry from
another Fox character: the ‘gruff
but lovable Alex Keaton. Or wait,
maybe Fox is just playing him as
the .button—down Reagan Era
movie—goer, looking at the sick
soul of his country’s past and
clicking his tongue.

THE PI'I'l' NEWS, Thursday, August 31. 1989

By Jennifer Davis
For The Pitt News

The Pixies and Love and
Rockets are synonymous with
college radio and the new wave
music scene, but these two
aberrant bands have much more
than that in common. Success
came almost instantaneously for
the Pixies, probably due to their
innovative melodies and novel
lyrics. '

The Pixies, a band out of
Boston, are not actually pixies,
but consist of three men and ‘a
woman. Lead singer and founding
member Black Francis, whose
real name is Charles Michael
Kitridge Thompson IV, ditched
college after six months and a
-short visit to Puerto Rico to fulfill

his passion for rock ‘n’ roll.

His next task was to persuade
his former college roommate,Joey
Santiago, to forgo a possible
degree in exchange for a guitar.
It was Santiago who dreamed up
the group's name. Originally, he
wanted them to be called “Pixies
in Panoply," but in time the name
was curtailed.

With name in hand, these two
lads set out to find a bassist by
placing a musician’s classified ad
that described them as a “Husker
Du and Peter, Paul and Mary
band." Mrs. john Murphy, who
reverted to her maiden name
Kim Deal,- answered the ad
because she thought it was “cute.”
Although Kim arrived minus a
bass, she was the only one who

replied, so she got the position.

 Her drummer friend David
Lovering was recruited in July of
1986 to complete the roster.

The Pixies recorded a demo
tape for England’s 4AD label,‘
which turned into an eight—song
mini-album entitled Come on
Pilgrim that was released in
October of 1987. The band’s
impressive rhythm climbed the
U.K. indie charts all the way to
No. 1.

The Pixies’ next chart-climber
was Surfer Rosa, their first full-
length album released in March
of 1988. The album’s subject
matter became the focus of much
attention. Charles’ preoccupation
with God is easily noticed, as are
some of the Hispanic song titles
like “Vamos.”

The religious themes are a
reflection of Charles’ “bom again”
Pentecostal background. “I was
12, and religion came over my
entire family,” says Charles. “I
grew up exposed to a lot of
preaching and righteous rage,
and although I’ve rejected the
content of all of that, the style ht
left an impression on me. It
certainly left me f—cked up.”

The Hispanic allusions were
inspired by Charles’ sojourn in:
Puerto Rico and a primal emotion
conjured up during his
archaeological digs in Arizona.

Spin named the Pixies its
“Musicians of the Year,” as did
the U.K.’s Sounds and Melody
Maker. The hit single “Gigantic;
from Surfer Rosa brought on the
Pixies’ first headlining tour in the
U.K. and Europe.

The Pixies’ second album,
Doolittle, their first on a major
label (Elektra), is also on its way
up the music charts. Doolittle

captures the Pixies’
lightheartedness and unique
sound in every chord.

Along with the Pixies, the band
Love and Rockets has recently
exploded dnto the music scene,
but only after attaining a cult
following with the underground
success Bauhaus. Love and
Rockets was formed by the
members of Bauhaus, minus lead
singer Peter Murphy, who is
currently enjoying a solo career.

Beginning with the eerie Dream
of a Teenage Heaven in 1985, and
continuing with the blistering
Express which contains the
favorite “Ball of Confusion” in
1986, Love and Rockets continues
to display its inner euphony.

Guitarist/singer Daniel Ash and _
his clan achieved continued _ - 
success with their third album, 5 " N 
Eart/7"Sun ‘Moon, which featured
atmospheric adventure and
upbeat lyrics. For the first time,
Love and Rockets was getting
airplay on top-40 radio stations,
and as a direct result, were gaining
more intensified fans. .   pg-~

Sex, Lies and Videotape is one

of this year’s big surprises,

probably the most highly touted
American art indite since Stranger
Than Paradise. Done on a
shoestring budget ($1.2 million)
by 26-year-old f1rst—time writer/
director Steven Soderbergh, the
movie entered this year’s Cannes
Film Festival at the last minute
and ended up winning the Best
Film and Best Actor awards.
The movie is a funny, low—key
psychodrama about relationships,

and more specifically, sex, lies
and videotapes. Anyone who has
a problem with films about
yuppies, be forewarned: the four
main characters of Sex, Lies and
Videotape are all full—ﬂedged
members of the tbirtysometbing
crowd. ‘
John (Peter Gallagher) is a
cocky, philandering lawyer who
doesn’t let his frigid marriage to
Ann (Andie MacDowe1l) inhibit
his sex life. While Ann does
housework and visits her
therapist, John beds her sister
Cynthia (Laura San Giacomo).
Enter a mysterious loner,

Graham (James Spader), who rolls
into the Louisiana town where
they live after nine years of
wandering. John and Graham

were roommates in college, and»

now they couldn’t be more
different. Graham thinks John is
a liar. John doesn’t know what to

make of Graham, who never _

joined the rat race and dresses
like “the undertaker of the art
world.”

Ann is attracted to Graham.

_Much to her dismay, she soon

discovers that he is impotent and
derives sexual pleasure from
watching videotapes he's made
of women discussing their se
lives. '
Though all four players are
quite sexy, the sex of the title is
talked about more than shown.
Most gripping are the videotape
scenes, in which women pour
out tense, weird confessions to
Graham’s questions ( “What is
the most unusual location you’ve
ever masturbated in?”, “When was

etc).

The dialogue and acting give

uncanny sense of intimacy. The
four unknowns in the lead roles
are all excellent and at least three
of them — Spader, MacDowell
and San Giocomo — have the
talent and charisma to be big in
years to come. They have you
hanging on ~ every pause in
dialogue, on every eye
movement. The performances
work so well that it doesn’t matter
that the characters are types and
that they don’t seem to exist
outside the confines of the film.

The film looks good for its low
budget (though the sound isn’t A
so hot). Sometimes it’s a little too
pretty; in their jeans, button-
downs and Bundeswehr T-shirts,
the characters lookalike models
who just walked off the set of a
yuppie beer commercial.

knows how to take a good shot.

going to be a great beneﬁt to the
incoming students. According to
the course description guide, the
purpose of Freshman Studies 1 is
to “introduce new students to
university life in both its social
and academic aspects.”

Besides research methods
using the library, other topics to
be discussed will include: time
management and study skills,
AIDS and sexuality, the minority
experience, selecting courses and
majors, and roommates and living
together. A discussion format will
be utilized in the credit-no entry
course.

The ULS is “currently trying

, to recruit library staff to instruct

the classes," said Whitmore. A
large,
number will be needed to cover
the 2,300 freshmen. Whitmore
stated that the library has already
“scripted and devised a slide-
tape program on PITT CAT,”

. which will be shown to all

freshmen. There may also be
tours given and further instruction
on how to use other library
services.

PITTCAT is the university's
computer library information
network, which contains over 1
million of the 5.5 million volumes
that Pitt has. To access the files,
you can search by author, subject,
or title. The computer will then

quickly display which libraries

have the book, where the book is
located there, and if the book is
currently checked out or on
reserve. ,

New volume additions are

being added to PI’I'I‘CAT’S data A

banks each month, and in the

future PITT CAT will feature key I
.word searching. The university

has PI'I'I‘CAT terminals located
throughout the ULS libraries.

The tours will also introduce
the freshmen to INFOTRAC, a
computer system similar to
PI’_I'I‘ CAT, which is used to access
the periodical holdings of the
university. There are presently
four INFOTRAC terminals on the
ground ﬂoor of Hillman.

In addition to these help
systems, there is a library research
laboratory on the ground ﬂoor of
Hillman. This service, managed
by Computer Information
Services, can assist students in
bibliographic searches in libraries
throughout the country.

Through computer linkup

. with other libraries, it is possible

for students and faculty to get
interlibrary loans, photocopies of
material, and FAX printouts from
other institutions. Charges for
these services are usually modest,
but vary due to the policies of
otherlibraries. The media services
department, located in Hillman,
provides film and tape viewing
and recording apparatus for
university affiliates.

In response to students
Hillman will
experiment this fall‘ with
expanded hours on weekends.
On Saturday, hours will be from
9 a.m. to 7 p.m., as opposed to
the previous 4:45 p.m. closing

Twtirne. Sunday's hours will be 10

a.m. to midnight. Last year, the
library opened at noon on
Sundays.

presently undecided.

Continued from page 1
“Nobody in the department is
unhappy with this change.”

Schmidt said that three students
had signed up to take a class in
glass blowing, but added that
they found another class and are
not unhappy with the situation.

Three protesters gathered in
front of Dougherty Hall at about
noon and displayed a banner
which read, “Disarm Carnegie
Mellon.” Immediately they began
handing out leaﬂets to passing
students about their grievances.
CMU campus police showed up
shortly afterwards. They expected
no trouble from the protesters
but were there to arrest Eirene.

Eirene skipped bond after being
released from jail for blocking
the entrance to CMU’s Software
Engineering Institute on Aug. 6.
Eirene’s action on that day was to
mourn the anniversary of the

bombing of Hiroshima, Japan in _

1945. SEI is under contract with
the Defense Department to
develop computer software for
the military. ’
Despite the police presence,
CMU Sergeant William E. Ricci

expressed his apprehension
about arresting Eirene during the
protest.

“Vince wants publicity and the
university doesn’t want to give
that to him,” he said.

The officers left at
approximately 12:15 p.m., 15
minutes before Eirene was due to
arrive.

When Eirene arrived he was
not surprised at the officers’
apprehension.

“They’ll probably arrest me at
another time while I’m buying
Fritos or something,” he said.

Eirene said that when he is
arrested he will probably spend

one month in the Allegheny‘

County Jail.

’ Yesterday’s protest ,was
attended by a television crew
from the cable show Peace TV,
which airs on Pittsburgh
Community Television, cable
channel 21. The show has
interviewed Eirene numerous
times during other protests in
which he was involved.

installed mandatory self—defense
classes, says Smith. He says that
he'd also like to see that done at
Pitt. But for right now, he just
wants the class to remain available

to interested students.

“Because of some funding
problems, the self—defense class,
along with some other physical
education classes, may not be
offered for the winter term. That’s
a shame.”

The response to Smith’s class
has been tremendous, he says,
but there is room for more
students this fall, and he
encourages students to take the
course before anything happens
to them or someone they know.

“T oo often people wait for
something to happen before
doing anything about it. There's
always a degree of apathy in a
college atmosphere. Oakland is a
fun place to be, but there is crime
here, and students need to take
measures to protect themselves.”

Smith began writing “Buy
Yourself a Minute” six years ago
at the urging of students, “who
said they couldn’t find the things
I was teaching on the market.”

In addition to teaching the
BYAM method at several other
Pittsburgh area schools, Smith
also holds a fourth degree black
belt in karate and ju-jitsu, and
operates martial arts schools
throughout the area. He is a 1976
graduate of Pitt, where he played
football. '

Smith’s book is available in the
student book center for $8.
Though he encourages people to
take the course along with reading
the book, Smith says the book
alone is a useful resource.

‘“The book is very self»

explanatory. It gives you a first-
hand look at what to look for,
how to identify a dangerous
situation, and especially how to
stay away from getting into one.”

Chinese bluff in B€1]1Ilg

History is one thing that will never change. Or is it?

According to The Pittsbugb Press, it appears to be doing
just that these days in Beijing. Less than 100 days after the
massacre in Tiananmen Square, students and other eye-

witnesses are being told that what they saw did not really
occur.

Not only is the Chinese government telling them that 2

approximately 3,000 people were not murdered by the
army, but they are forcing even those who lost a family

member or close friend tolie about what happened on

that fateful June day. ‘ .

“I must lie or I will go to jail,” explained one student at
-the University of Beijing. According to her, the govern-
ment is expecting them to write a phony diary telling
where they were and what they ‘thought during the
turmoil; ’ A J I ’

_With a government such as this, it is no wonder that so
many students in China were willing to risk their lives in
order to obtain true democracy and freedom.

The government, however, has chosen to portray those
who were involved in the student movement as “counter-
revolutionaries” and “the people who do not know the
truth.” Isn’t it ironic that the country that is instructing its
people to lie would accuse anyone of not knowing the
truth? , »

What must it be like to live in a‘ country where one
cannot mourn the loss of fellow students, or even
acknowledge their deaths? * ‘

A As Americanstudents, we often take for granted our
right to fight for our beliefs. An estimated 3,000 Chinese
students died for that right, but their government will not
even allow them the honor of having died for their beliefs.

It is our duty to remind the world of what happened in
Beijing. We must not permit the Chinese government to
lie to future generations about the massacre of students
who were murdered simply for standing up for their right

d to freedom. How would we feel if it had. been our friends,

our neighbors, our teachers who had been killed? The
Chinese government may be able to silence its people
with threats of imprisonment, but we as Americans, will
not be silenced.

Jews & Catholics clash   over convent

This whole “convent contro-
versy” is really blowing my mind.

i I've been following the story for

several weeks now, and until
Tuesday,-I thought it was amus-

ingly sad. On Tuesday morning, I

I picked up my trusty copy of The
New York Times, only to ﬁnd that
it is now a front-page story,

continued in depth on page five.

Now I’m upset.

What is this “convent contro-
versy” that has everyone so en-
raged? Allow me to brief you. A
bunch of nuns, Catholic sisters. of
the Carmelite order, have been
living in a convent on the border
of the Auschwitz-Birkenau con-
centration camp in Poland for the
past five years. According to an
agreement made in 1987 between
archbishops in Poland and Jew-
ish representatives from around
the world, the convent was sup-
posed to be relocated this past
February. '

Why did they want to relocate
it? Many Jews objected to the
presence of a convent near
grounds that are symbolic of the
suffering their people endured
during the Holocaust. It is esti-
mated that over 2 million Jews
may have been put to death in
the Auschwitz—Birkenau complex
alone.

Anyway, seven ‘months later,
the Catholic Church still has not
relocated the nuns, the convent,
nor the twenty—three foot cross
that stands beside it — as they
had promised. It seems they are
having some sort of technical
difficulty with the actual reloca-
tion. And in the meantime, the
nuns are hanging _ out by
Auschwitz praying for the souls
of the victims, and the Jews are

protesting. Groups of 100 or so
are going to the convent with
signs stating, “Carmelites leave

 

Auschwitz.”

In The New York Times on
Tuesday, I read about the Roman
Catholic Primate of Poland, Car-
dinal Glemp, who made some
fairly offensive comments about
Jews in-Poland. Offensive enough
that I won't reprint them here.
Suffice it to say, the guy just made

‘things a whole lot worse.

Why was I arnusingly saddened
by all of this? It just seems silly
that a bunch of nuns could cause
this much trouble. In all my years
of Catholic school, the only thing
I ever saw a nun Cause trouble
about was my socks not being
pulled up. Admittedly, the delay
in relocating is not totally the
nuns’ fault. This is one reason
why the story is so sad. What are
Church leaders thinking? “Aloof”
is the word that T be New York
Timesused to describe the pope’s
position on the issue. And now
the Jews are scaling the walls" of
the convent and getting beaten
up by the workers. People are
saying that the nuns are praying
for the conversion of the Jews to
Christianity. Now we're looking
at a serious controversy between
two religious groups who have
lived together in peace for quite
some time. _

And that is why I am upset.

A couple of weeks ago, I was
having a cup of coffee in a diner
on the lower west side of New

York City with a friend of mine

I whom I will call Al. Al is a Polish

Jew who is completing his doc-
torate at the Jewish Theological
Seminaryof America. I asked Al
what he thought about‘ this
“convent controversy” and he said
that he thought the whole thing
was pretty stupid. I
To A], the memory of Auschwitz
and of the things that happened
to his ancestors there is one that
exists in his heart and mind. It
does not exist on a plot ofland.
Al has been to Auschwitz a few

1 times, and he can’t believe that

anyone would want to live there.
“If these nuns want to live in that

(V

godforsaken depressing place and J»

pray, they can be my guests.
Heck — not only Jews were
killed there. Right now the Jew-
ish people have an awful lot of
much larger, more pressing prob-

lems in the world to deal with‘?

than some Carmelites who are
doingtheir own thing.”

I agree with Al. This “convent
controversy” is ridiculous. It seems
that the two groups are headed
for a real disaster — as if they
didn’t have enough trouble to
deal with in the first place. The
nuns could pray for the victims
somewhere else. The Jews could
remember what happened at
Auschwit regardless of the nearby
convent. Out of the two religious

groups, one of them should be O

able to do the right thing and
“give in” to the more peaceful
solution. The fact that neither
one will do so causes this situ-

ation to escalate and escalate. v

Well, it really blows my mind.

The start of a new year... Could the day have been any worse? .

When I awoke yesterday morn-
ing, I was bright-eyed and bushy-
tailed. I was looking forward to
the startof a brand-new term.

As I made my way to the bath-
room to put my contacts into my
eyes, I noticed that my roommate
was wearing the clothes I had
planned to wear. That's okay —

I could still wear my green pants
with my orange shirt.

I then made my way into the

orange juice. I thought I saw
something moving in my juice,
so I bent closer to take a peep.
Don’t ask me how it happened,

kitchen for a wholesome glass of I

but I lost my contact in my or-

ange juice! Who cares; I’ll just

 

wink at everyone all day.

I was a little late getting to my
first class because my curling
iron broke. However, I rushed
into the lecture hall, filled with
about 200 people, and managed
to trip over a discarded banana
peel and fall ﬂat on my face. It
wasn’t too bad though; only about
half of the people laughed — the

rest just felt sorry for me.

But all in all, I think the day
went well. It could have been
worse — all of this really could
have happened!

 PITT VS. PACIFIC at PITT STADIUM SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 2, 1989, 1:30
 Pitt opens against Paciﬁc in start of 100th season

By Thomas Danyluk
Staff Writer

Pitt versus Paciﬁc, contrary to popular hearsay, is n0tPittsburgh
City Council’s way of administering sweet revenge on Mike
Merriweather for his year—long contract holdout that gave the
beloved Steelers such fits.

It sounds like a fairly plausible plot, though, doesn’t it? Talk Pitt
into scheduling the linebacker’s alma mater, a team coming off an
embarrassing 2-9 1988 campaign, and let the Panthers play
hackey—sack with its football team. The old kick ‘em while they’re
down approach.

It might irritate him a little. One thing’s for sure: the Steelers
aren’t gonna be able to do it themselves by beating the Minnesota
Vikings, Merriweather’s new team, when they meet up in late
September.

The truth is that Indian, Atlantic and Arctic are all busy this
weekend.

About the only sure threat that the Pacific Tigers present to Pitt
in this weekend’s opener is uncertainty. There was a coaching
shake—up out there after the team’s miserable showing last season.
Walt Harris is the new head coach, coming to the school from his
previous positions of offensive coordinator and quarterback
coach at Tennessee. .

New coach, new plays, new outlook — Pitt head man Mike
Gottfried isn’t quite sure what to expect from Pacific. “We’ve been
watching a lot of Tennessee film. It’s tough playing teams that are
in a situation where they have a new coach. You’re not quite sure
where they’ll be coming from.”

“Our primary assignment is to change an attitude here,” said
Harris. “Right now it’s far below the expectations of our staff.”

What Gottfried does know is that the Tigers are experimenting
with something new on both offense and defense. Offensively,
Harris is trying to install a pro—set offense with an emphasis on
trying to improve the team’s passing game. “We are a football team

By Matt Martin
Editor in Chief

Prentiss Wright charges back to the defensive side of the ball. He
has just broken through the offensive line and met the running
back head on, between other whoops and hollers, he screams,
“I’m coming for you! I’m coming for you!” at his offensive
counterpart from under his helmet, where his game goggles are
the only things visible next to an ever-growing smile.

It’s the third day of fall practice, the first with full equipment, and
Wright, a S-foot-10, 212-pound junior linebacker, is already in mid-
season form.

Wright is the self—proclaimed cheerleader of the 1989 Pitt
Panther football team, a solid bundle of energy who yearns by the
minute for one more play, one more tackle, one more hit; and his
attitude seems to be infecting the rest of his defensive teammates.

“They love it when I do that stuff,” Wright says. “When I’m not
up, they say, ‘P, what’s wrong?’ They think something’s wrong if
I’m not doing that.” ,

Wright’s emotional states are not antics or gimmicks, he says.
“I’ve always been energetic. I like to intimidate my opponent, and
if I go out on the field screaming and hollering, I do intimidate
them.” A

Wright contributed five sacks and 53 tackles — five for losses -
to l988’s 6—S squad, primarily as a reserve weak—side linebacker
and blitzing specialist. - ,’

“My favorite part of the game is blitzing,” he says. “It puts chills
in my body when I hear them call a blitz for me in the huddle.”

same thing applied to [Tom] Rick-
etts and lBurtl Grossman. None
of those three ever tested posi~
live at Pill.”

Pitt head coach Mike Gottfried
had no comment on the situ-
anon.

The other suspended players
are Matt jaworski, Sean Doctor,
and Tom Doctor of the Buffalo
Bills, the Chicago Bears’ Maurice
Douglass, Mike Arley and Keith
Uecker of the Green Bay Pack-
ers, Mark Mraz of the Los Angeles
Raiders, the Philadelphia Eagles’
Ron Solt, Keith Henderson and

Kirk was taken by the Los
Angeles Rams in the ninth round
of the NFL draft held in May. He
had 82 yards on six receptions for
the Panthers last season, but is
more valuable as a blocker. In
1986 he had four catches, one of
them a 59-yard touchdown.

designed to run the wishbone,”
said Harris. “The two offenses
are diametrically opposite. Both
are executionally orientated, but
the passing offense is much more
complex and it will take us a
while to solidify it.” Uh huh.

Oh, and he’s going into it with
a true freshman quarterback, a
kid named Dave Henigan. That
should make it all the more inter-

On defense, the Tigers are ﬂirt-

something Gottfried is quite
familiar with.

“Yeah, I used to run an eight-

give us problems because of the

Editor’s Note : Ybists part two of a two-
part series by The Pitt News. assistant
sports edtitor; lmke Rampa, describing bis
summer internship.

The US Olympic Comrnittee’s depart-
ment of Public Information and Media
Relations .is the national headquarters for
any type of information concerning the
Olympics.

Organizations from professional sports
teams, national networks such as
SportsChannel and CBS Sports, freelance
writers and children call the department
each day to have various questions an-
swered. Part of my intership duties in-
cluded answering these various inquiries,
which proved to be a bit more effort than
I had anticipated. ,

Occasionally, the questions were simple;
like a 10-year-old child asking how to get
in touch with Florence Griffith-Joyner. All
you do is give them the number of the
respective public relations agent. How-
ever, some newspapers and magazines
wanted to know such seemingly obscure
things as the order of the ﬁnish, including
times, of the 400-m relay in 1932. ,

Answering these inquirires took a bit
more leg work, which included accessing
past records and files. Sometimes, I would
have to go to an entirely different building
and dig out ofﬁcial Olympic records. Some
of these had accumulated so much dust
over the years that the storage rooms

I] looked like ancient Egyptian burial tombs.
I Sometimes, the answer would lie in a

place as convientent as this year’s Olym-
pic fact book or a colleague's or supervi-
sor’s brain.

Phone work aside, the department was

primarily busy with accessing information
concerning this year’s Olympic Festival;
the largest amateur sports competition in
the country. The Festival is held annually
except during Olympic years. This year, it
took place in Oklahoma City and received

 

substantial press coverage and massive air
time from ESPN. _

As an intern, I was assigned to different
amateur sports federations, and I was
responsible for compiling the necessary
information to be printed in the USOC’s
weekly press release. The information I
needed consisted of team designations
(N,S,E,W) for each sport, roster informa-
tion for each athlete, (height, weight,
school or club affiliation, and event or
position), and short squibs about the top

athletes in each sport.

I thought this information would be
easy to obtain from the respective sports
federations. However, I found out that like
any organization or office environment,
national governing bodies, with the ex-
ception of the well—funded sports such as
basketball, are just as disorganized and
procrastinating as a back alley insurance

I company.

The reason for this was simply money.
Some federations (judo, for one) operate
out of the president’s home and have no
official office location because they can-
not afford it. USA Wrestling is located in a
“still in the process of remodeling” office
building which contains a real estate
company and a hair salon.

These sports receive absolutely no
money from the government whatsoever.
They operate solely on the donations of
the American public. Last year, the USOC
raised over $200 million dollars in public
and private donations. Either this money
is not nearly enough to upgrade the sports
facilites and federation offices, or else it is
tied up in some area which produces no
visible improvement.

Speaking of money, the Colorado Springs
Training facility is actually an old Air Force
base which was given to the USOC on the
terms that they pay the" government one
dollara year for 99 years. Not a bad deal.
In fact, I am thinking about looking for an
apartment there sometime in the future. '

Anyway, compiling the roster informa-
tion for the weekly press releases was
somewhat difficult, due to the disorgani-
zation of the sports federations. I found
that the most helpful organizations were
very minor and less publicized sports such
as badminton and slow-pitch softball.
These sports were so starved for publicity
and a good name with anyone they dealt
with, that they employed professional
public relations agents who would do
anything I asked. As a result, their rosters
were the most complete, and their press
releases were the most timely in terms of
educating the media about their top ath-
letes prior to the Olympic Festival.

The weekly releases were sent to all of
the major media across the country. When’
anyone’ had a question or wanted further
information, they would ‘call our office
and request it.

To be honest, compiling the roster infor-
mation and typing it into the computer for

Summer sports internship more wor/e tbarz glitz

printing was extremely tedious. I left the
