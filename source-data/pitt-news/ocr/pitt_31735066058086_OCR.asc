Trustees
approve
'95 Pin
budge!

By Sam Gresock

Graphics Assistant

The University of Pittsburgh
capital budget for fiscal year
1995 was approved Friday.

Pitt’s board of trustees voted
at Friday’s meeting to accept the
$154,922,436 budget, despite
some opposition over the bud-
get’s inclusion of an $8 million
telescope project in Chile.

The cost of the Magellan
Telescope project will be cov-
ered with $5 million in private
gifts earmarked for the tele-
scope. The remaining $3 million
will be taken from the
Chancellor’s Discretionary
Fund.

Pitt Chancellor J. Dennis
O’Connor strongly defended the
telescope, calling it an “opportu-
nity of a lifetime” and denounc-
ing critics who said the $8 mil-
lion could be used for other pro-
jects such as lab upgrades and
facilities improvements.

“This particular project repre-
sents a once—in-a—lifetime oppor-
tunity for this university to stay
in the forefront of what will
become the science of the next
millennium, cosmology,”
O’Connor said. “We’re talking
about an $8 million capital

'l'|-usiees puss five-year plan

By John B. Moore

Asst. News Editor

Pitt’s board of trustees accepted the goals behind
a document outlining the university’s strategies.

“Toward the 21st Century,” a comprehensive
plan approved at Friday’s meeting, details short
and long-terrn goals for the university in an effort
to guide the school’s direction for the remainder of
the century.

One of the 10 strategies of the plan is to increase
the percentage of out-of-state students applying to
Pitt.

Objective 1.3 of the document states, “At present
16 percent of the Pittsburgh campus student body
are non-Pennsylvania residents. At the regional
campuses, approximately 3 percent of the students
come from out-of-state.”

The document, presented by the university’s
Long Range Planning Committee, suggests look-

ing beyond current traditional student sources to
identify new student populations.

According to “Toward the 21st Century,” Pitt
needs to “create an institutional recruitment and
ﬁnancial aid strategy to improve the quality and
diversity of the student body.”

By diversifying the students admitted, university
officials agreed the quality of the student body as
well as Pitt’s reputation would be enhanced.

The five—year strategy originated from
Chancellor J. Dennis O’Connor’s “call for plan-
ning” to all units within the university.

The document details nine other goals:

°Facilitate the discovery of knowledge, enhance
funded research opportunities and promote and
assist investigations.

°Serve Pennsylvania residents and those beyond
by seeking solutions to problems of human society

and condition.

Male body lound dead in Panther Hollow Friday

By John B. Moore
and Sam Gresock
The Pitt News

On Friday at 8:50 a.m., a University of
Pittsburgh graduate student found a male
body hanging from a tree near Panther
Hollow on Boundary Street.

Nancy Atkinson said she discovered
the body while looking for a parking
space in the area. .

“I turned the car around, and I saw this
guy hanging from a tree,” Atkinson said.
“My first impulse was that this was

false, some sort of Halloween prank. But
when I got out of the car  I realized
this was a real body.”

Atkinson said she realized the body
was real after seeing hair on his legs.

She also said a gold car with out-of-
state license plates with its door opened
was found on the scene along with
another car and a hose on the ground.

“He was hanging from a tree close to
the road  it was horrible,” said
Atkinson. “The most striking thing was
that I didn’t believe it was real.”

Sergeant Mikolajek from Zone 6

police said University of Pittsburgh
police had received a call at 9:07 a.m.
notifying them of a body hanging from
the tree. 3

Mikolajek said the body was of a white
male in his early 20s, and paramedics
pronounced him dead at the scene.

Rick Boyd, director of the University
of Pittsburgh’s Public Safety
Department, said the male was at
Carnegie Mellon University student.

The investigation has been turned over
to the Homicide Department of
Pittsburgh city police.

CWO continues communication in alleged assault

By Chris Kocher
For The Pitt News

Pitt’s Campus Women’s Organization will continue to cooperate
with university officials in the investigation of an alleged indecent
assault on campus, said CWO Co-President Scott Dolin at its meet-
ing Thursday.

However, CWO said it is concerned about how the assault, which
allegedly occurred at the Phi Gamma Delta (FIJI) fraternity house
on Sept. 10, might have been handled without the recent number of
news articles about the incident.

“If Scott and I and this organization had not followed up on a lit-
tle police blotter one day, this issue would not even have gone as
far as it has,” said Stephanie Sudzina, CWO co-president.

Both Sudzina and Dolin met Thursday with Leon Haley, vice
chancellor for student and public affairs, regarding the incident, and
said they are confident in his handling of the investigations.

“The punishment could possibly be very harsh to set a precedent
on this campus, to show that this behavior will not be tolerated any-

, more,” Sudzina said.

Dolin said he was originally told by the Interfratemity Council
that no social sanctions would be taken against FIJI and the other
two fraternities involved, Delta Tau Delta and Sigma Chi, but now
those fraternities would not be having social functions that week-
end.

“That’s sort of contradictory,” Dolin said. “It’s sort of like, well,
when we just requested it maybe that wasn’t good enough, but if
the papers write about it, then they have to do something.”

Dolin said he and Sudzina would meet Monday with IFC and the ‘

Panhellenic Association to discuss the incident and IFC’s investiga-
tion of it.
“If the publicity didn’t hit, a big question is whether or not any
investigation would be going on other than Public Safety’s,” Dolin

offering to pay white children
money to beat up black children
who moved into the housing

The Pitt News, Monday, October 24, 1994

There is always a big con-
troversy between the two
operating systems (OS) used
at Pitt. One is called
VAX/VMS and the other
UNIX. As Pitt students,

‘instead of Computing and

Information Services (CIS)
making that tough decision of
which OS to use for us, they
give us an option of whether
to use one or both if we
choose. As with some major
political or moral issue, every-
one has their own opinion as
to which OS is better.

Most Freshman Studies
classes introduce us to the
VMS system. It offers simple-
to-use commands that mimic
the popular IBM-PC DOS
commands. As an added fea-
ture, it is considered faster
than its UNIX counterpart.
VMS also allows you to uti-
lize the feature most students
enjoy, e-mail.

UNIX is another story. It is
my experience that, as fresh-
men become accustomed to
the computer systems and the
use of the Internet, they look
for more. There are numerous
and varied uses for both UNIX

and VMS, but if you seek
more options when it comes to
the Net, look to UNIX. Most
programs that are on VMS are
available on UNIX as well,
but in my opinion the pro-
grams on UNIX are easier to
use, more pleasing to the eye

 

and just plain better. I feel the
most glaring differences in the
OSS are the mail programs. In
UNIX the mail program is
called “pine,” and in VMS it is
called “mail.” Pine simply
puts mail to shame in many
respects, such as the use of an
address book, mailing lists and
of the easy-to-use graphic
style.

For many people, it is a

toss-up as to which OS to use.
Since VMS was what they
started out with, they still use
it. In my experience, after peo-
ple are introduced to UNIX,
they never return to VMS.

Both are good systems. If
you are a novice and don’t
intend to go any farther into
the Internet, then stick with
VMS. UND( is for the people
who like to venture into the
unknown, to see what’s out
there and aren’t afraid to try
something new.

To connect to VMS at the
“Local>“ prompt, type “con-
nect vms.” To connect to
VMS on a lab computer, type
“vms” after selecting the
“OPEN A SESSION  com-‘
mand in the menu bar of an
NCSA Telnet program. (You
can substitute vml, vm2, or
vm3 for vms.) To connect to
UNIX at the “Local>“ prompt,
type “connect unixd.” To con-
nect to VMS on a lab comput-
er, type “unixd” after selecting
the “OPEN A SESSION 
command in the menu bar of
an NCSA Telnet program.
(You can substitute unixs for
unixd.) Talk to you soon.

New computer lab opens

By Anthony Breznican
For The Pitt News

Pitt’s Learning Skills Center
serves about 200 to 250 Pitt stu-
dents with disabilities a year,
and after unveiling the new
Adaptive Computer Training
Lab they expect to be able to
help a lot more.

The center in cooperation
with the Academic Computing
office opened the two new labs
in Rooms 510 and 514 of the
William Pitt Union last
Thursday. One focuses on math,
reading and study skills instruc-
tion for students with learning
disabilities. The other assists
students with physical disabili-
ties who would not normally be
able to use a conventional com-
puter.

The different types of hard-
ware and software in the lab
cost an estimated $70,000. As
far as computers go, the lab is as
cutting-edge as it could get, said
adaptive computer specialist
Steve Tokar.

One of the people this lab will
assist is senior Susan Silliman, a

blind student majoring in com-
munications.

Aside from having a braille
printer, the lab is equipped with
a scanner that can read written
material into the computer, and
a voice synthesizer that speaks it
back to the user.

“With this scanner I can take
classroom handouts and  read
them like a regular document,”
Silliman said. “This is just
quicker and [available] when I
want to do it, rather than having
someone read it to me.”

‘The purpose of the lab is to
train the students in the use of
computers so that they can use
them not only in their course
assignments but also in the
workplace after they graduate.

“We’re enabling the students
to be much more directly active
in their own learning process,
and in many ways helping to
increase the efficiency with
which they can get those assign-
ments done,” said Learning
Skills Coordinator Georgine
Materniak.

Pitt hosts minority conference

By Erica Glasspool
.S_ta.1T Writer

Educators and students from across the nation
attended the second annual Minority Recruitment
Conference this weekend at the University of
Pittsburgh. ,

“The intent of this conference is to establish
long-term relationships with leaders in the ﬁeld of
minority education and to enhance minority repre-
sentations in our graduate and post-graduate edu-
cational programs,” said Barry Kaplan, director of
minority recruitment and retention.

The conference is one part of a large program
called Minority Education and Professional
Development Opportunities, specifically for the
recruitment and retention of minority students in
the behavioral and biomedical sciences.

The program is broken down into two cate-
gories, one concerning ethics and the other on
raising numbers in minority diversity among stu-
dents in science.

Deﬁning respectable behavior in research, from
Freud to plagiarism, falls in part of the ethics cate-
gory, said Zigmond.

“This is to insure giving people proper credit.
It’s to stop students from collecting data and
doing research and then having a professor take
the credit.”

The second part of the program helps to recruit
students and keep them at Pitt through graduate
school, post-doctorate training and then to stay on
as faculty.

“The number of minority students who make it
into college for science and then drop out is hor-
rific,” said David Burgess, chairman of biological
sciences.

Fifteen percent of the nation is African-
American, and less than one percent are faculty
members of science—related departments.

“We are way, way off and need to change this
social imperative,” said Michael Zigmond, a pro-
fessor in the Department of Behavioral
Neuroscience. ,

“If we can raise the number of minority stu-
dents, then the chance of recruiting minority fac-
ulty is even greater,” said Johanna Reed, confer-
ence coordinator.

The program’s intent is to establish long-terrn
relationships with minority educational institutes
and their leaders.

Faculty members are invited to spend a year
researching or teaching at Pitt to learn about Pitt
as an institution. The exchange of faculty mem-
bers helps to build a network of relationships.

Edward Smith is a professor of molecular biolo-
gy at Hampton University. He is planning on stay-
ing at Pitt for a year to work on research in reposi-
tory neurology and cardiovascular physiology
with two other Pitt professors.

“I think Pitt has a quality neuroscience pro-
gram, and I can give my students incentive to
come here instead of Harvard or Stanford,
because they would already have ties,” said
Smith. “Why else would they come here, if they

said.

Sudzina pointed out that
CWO’s pursuit of the truth
regarding the assault is not a
“one-woman crusade,” saying
that CWO has the support of
the Bisexual, Gay and Lesbian
Alliance and the Organization
of Minority and Female
Conservatives.

“We in no way endorse mis-
treatment or abuse of women,
and we ask thatfirm punish-
ment be given to those who
have been found guilty of com-
mitting a crime,” said Booker
Stallworth, president of OMFC,

when asked for comment. “At

the same time, we do not

endorse the behavior of such’

women that allow themselves to

be put in the way of harm.”

CWO members discussed
having a “Take Back the Night”
march in response to the
assault.

The march, held in previous
years at Pitt and at various
places around the country, lets
people unite against violence
toward women, Dolin said.
Women and men share experi-
ences as they march for safer
streets.

“It’s a really great event, but
it’s also a lot of work,” Dolin
said, and he added he hoped
that members could organize a
march by the end of the term.

Committees were also formed
to coordinate activities related
to health, pro-choice, publicity,
volunteer and safety concerns.

Budget

°From page 1
investment in the scientiﬁc project in astron-
omy for the next 50 years.”

Pitt will develop the Magellan Telescope

project in partnership with the University of

Arizona and the Carnegie Institution of

Washington.

O’Connor said the telescope, which could
begin operation within three years, could
make Pitt an intemational leader in astrono-
my research.

“We were invited to join this project over
many other institutions based on the
strength of our astronomy department. Our
astronomers need viewing time,” O’Connor
said. “If we don’t do this project, we’ve
missed the opportunity of a lifetime.”

Trustee D. Michael Fisher, a Republican
state senator from Upper St. Clair, criticized
the project, saying that the Magellan scope
“may not be the best use of university
money.” Though funding is required to
come from the discretionary fund and pri-
vate gifts, Fisher questioned the decision to
fund the Chilean telescope.

“I understand you put conditions on it,
[but] I guess I’m a little concerned,” Fisher
said.

About half of the budget is earmarked for

FY 1995 projects, with the other half cover-
ing projects that are currently in operation.
According to trustee Frank Cahouet, the
board's Property and Facilities committee
reviewed and approved all FY 1995 con-
struction projects in excess of $1 million.

Among the other main projects listed in
the budget:

‘$18 million for Western Psychiatric
Institute and Clinic’s Children and Youth
Center

°$2 million for the cell biology and physi-
ology activities in Scaife Hall

‘$1.1 million for interior building
improvement at WPIC

-$24 million, previously approved, for a
medical research facility

‘$7.12 million, previously approved, for
phase 1 and 2 renovations at Pitt Stadium.

The board also endorsed Pitt’s “Toward
the 21st Century” document, which defines
the university’s goals and missions for the
remainder of the decade. The plan consists
of 10 strategies designed to guide Pitt’s aca-
demic and research planning. V '

“The [Ad Hoc Long Range Plannin
Committee feels there is a need to revisit
and revise the mission statement of the uni-
versity,” trustee James Roddey said. “This

The Pitt News, Monday, October 24, 1994

statement was adopted almost 19 years ago
and should be modified to more clearly
reﬂect the changes which have occurred in
both the external and internal environment.”

O’Connor said the plan’s goals and. strate-
gies reﬂect a cnicial period for higher edu-
cation as the end of the century approaches.

“I think these are very critical times for
American colleges and universities,”
O’Connor said. “I think it’s absolutely
imperative that we in higher education
examine  our sense of purpose, our deﬁni-
tion and our position relative to [our] nation-
al mission.”

In other activity Friday:

Lower the drinking age

The recent alleged sexual assault at a fraternity party has
again brought to the forefront the issue of underage drinking.
The Pitt News hasa simple solution for this problem —
lower the drinking age to 18.

The philosophical arguments against a 21-year-old drink-
ing age are numerous and powerful. If at the age of 18 we
achieve full citizen status, including the right to vote and die
for our country, by what moral right can the state deny us the
right to consume alcohol?

One could argue there is a certain level of responsibility
required before we should be allowed to drink. But how can

"this level of responsibility and maturity be judged higher

than that required to participate in deciding the leadership of
our nation?

Furthermore the moral rational against having a drinking
age at all is questionable. Should it really be the role of the
state to protect us from ourselves? We say no. Of course this
is not the only reason for having a drinking age. There is a
utilitarian argument involved as well. The idea is that by
restricting the use of alcohol we are saving society from
some of the evils associated with drinking. This is an
unfounded idea. In‘ fact a drinking age of 21 may do more
harm than good.

First of all, other nations, such as Germany and France,
have no drinking age and have far fewer alcohol-related
problems than America. In these nations, people are exposed
to alcohol from a young age and learn to handle it responsi-
bly.

The restriction of alcohol to minors gives drinking a rever-
ential status in this country. The temptation and peer pressure
involved in doing something which is restricted and can be
seen as a rebellion against parental authority and society
leads many people to drink.

It is very likely minors would drink with less frequency, or
at the least more responsibly, if there were no age restric-
tions. Instead, individuals capitalize on their opportunities to
drink and often go overboard.

Furthermore, the recent sexual assault situation here at
Pitt proffers another argument against the drinking
age. Alcohol consumption by college students under 21 will
never be stopped. But since it can be difficult to get into
bars," minors who wish to drink are often ‘forced to seek out
frat parties or other private parties. These situations, as we
have seen, can often be much less safe than drinking in pub-
lic. -

The extension of drinking age privileges would lead to
a decrease in the pressure to get completely smashed
when the opportunity presents itself, and since most
sex crimes are linked with alcohol, will decrease these as
well.

While there certainly is an argument to be made for elimi-
natingthe drinking age all together, this is probably unrealis-
tic at this time. But a 21-year-old drinking age is both moral-
ly corrupt and deficient in’ its utilitarian attempts. The
dichotomy at college of those who can drink and those who
cannot is not in the best interest of this nation’s universities
and should be abolished.

Unfair letter; column

As a brother of Sigma Alpha
Epsilon, I feel that the article
titled “Frat sexual assault
offense not alarming” on Oct.
18 and the article titled
“Personal look at gay fratemi-
ty members” on Oct. 19 are
extremely unjust, unfair and in
poor taste. In the first article,
Ms. Garofalo states that frater-
nities are “supposedly philan-
thropic organizations” and that
“the general tone [of fraternity
parties] is one of alcohol-

-induced bravado, testosterone

and inflated egos desperately

1 seeking validation.” This is

unfair and just not so.

First off, all men who attend
fraternity parties are not nec-
essarily members. Second,
Sigma Alpha Epsilon, as well
as most other fraternities at
Pitt, do not claim to be philan-
thropic organizations. They
are social fraternities in which
philanthropy is one of the
many dimensions. Because of
the alleged actions of one or
two individuals, it is extremely
unfair to slander the entire
Greek system.

In the second article, Mr.
Gray states that when one
hears of a fraternity party, they
think of a “meat market.”
When parties are hosted by
fraternities, they are intended
as a time to meet with friends,
relax and unwind from the
week and have a good time.
While fraternity men do have
sex with women, I am fairly
certain that you don’t have to
be in a fraternity to have sex. I
am willing to accept the fact
that there MAY be homosexu-
als in SOME houses on cam-
pus; but to claim that there are
at least two in each house is
preposterous. In addition, it is
in very poor taste to mention
three individual houses after
he makes these claims. Mr.
Gray can do whatever he
wants with his personal life for
all I care; but that’s just it.
Keep it personal. He was

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

ostracized by his fraternity for
“coming out,” so why does he
attempt to single out others
and subject them to the same
treatment? There are homo-
sexuals in other organizations
on campus that Mr. Gray has
probably had contact with, so
why are they not included in
his article?

Finally, when am I. going to
read about the many positive
aspects of Greek life instead of
just fraternity bashing? The
majority of the fraternities par-
ticipate in charitable pro-
grams, and many student lead-
ers are fraternity members.
Why have I not read about the
fact that Sigma Alpha Epsilon
has raised over $25,000 per
year for the Western
Pennsylvania School for the
Blind or any other fratemity’s
community service projects?
About 850,000 man-hours are
volunteered by Greeks to vari-
ous organizations per year. Of
the top 50 companies in the
United States, 43 have CEO’s
who are Greek, and since
1825, only three U.S. presi-
dents have not been Greek.
These positive activities are
rarely covered. All I am ask-
ing is that if the few negative
incidents are reported and arti-
cles like Mr. Gray’s can be
printed, that the positive
events be printed as well, and
the Greek system be recog-
nized fairly.

No names

Iam writing this in response
to the editorial written by Bill
Gray about homosexuals in
fraternities. Before I get to my
point, I’d like to say that I

admire you for. being able to
be open about your sexuality. I
strongly believe in people
being able to be who they real-
ly .are and not what other peo-
ple force them to pretend to
be. r V

However, although the theo-
ry that there are homosexuals
in every fraternity is very like-
ly to be true, I feel that it was

I totally unnecessary to name

certain fraternities in which
you had personal relations
with the members. That would

. be like a guy writing an article

and naming the sororities of
which he has had personal’
relations with the girls. People
would probably see that as
degrading to women. Well,
let’s face it, homosexuality is
not the most accepted thing in
society. Granted, although I
am heterosexual, I am very
open-minded about homosex-
uality. The problem is -— most
people aren’t. I really think
that naming three of 20-some
fraternities really makes a
small number of houses be
unfairly judged by a large por-
tion of society.

I’m not trying to be preju-
dice —— I’m just being honest.
Many feelings go along with
the thought of homosexuality
— fear, ignorance, curiosity,
confusion and, yes, sometimes
even acceptance. My point is
that these groups of people
(homosexual or not) should
not be perceived this way
unless the individual of that

group decides to voice his sex- _

ual preference himself! I’m
very sorry that we live in a
world where people can’t
always be themselves. I’m
also very sorry that society
can’t be more educated to
accept all people. But since

that is not the case for right '

now, I really feel that your
article should not have includ-
ed the names of fraternities
that will now be viewed in a
different light by many people.

Saturday.

One week after Majors
announced junior John Ryan
as the starting quarterback,
following Ryan’s 433-yard
explosion against West
Virginia, Pitt’s quarterbacking
problems looked like they
were solved.

But if we’ve learned any-
thing in the Panthers’ 1-7 sea-
son so far, we’ve learned
never to assume anything.

As Ryan stood in the spot-
light and ex-starter Sean
Fitzgerald sat on the sidelines
withhis tail between his legs,

there was one person lost on -

the quarterback carousel —-
redshirt freshman Pete
Gonzalez.

But after the smoke cleared
from Pitt’s 45-7 massacre at
B1acksburg,‘Va., Gonzalez
was left standing with Ryan
and Fitzgerald nailed to the
bench.

Gonzalez accounted for the
Panthers’ only score early in
the fourth quarter when he ran
a 12-yard quarterback draw
for a touchdown. But only
after Ryan and Fitzgerald
failed in their attempts.

“I’ve been frustrated all
year,” Gonzalez said in a
postgame interview. “I’ve
been the No. 3 [quarterback]
all year. I always wanted to
stay mentally prepared.

“I made some errors, but I
did a lot of positive things at
the same time.”

Gonzalez’s positives by far
outweighed his mistakes. He
completed four of six passes
for 53 yards, as opposed to
Ryan and Fitzgerald, who
combined to complete only
eight of 19 for 77 yards and
an interception in almost three
and a half more quarters’ of
play. '

The 6-foot—l-inch quarter-
back received his chance after
the dealer, Majors, showed
Ryan, then quickly inserted
Gonzalez for one play, then
switched back to Ryan.

Later in the second quarter,
Gonzalez was shown again
for another one-play stint, and
then Ryan checked back in.

Pitt gets "whi

The Pitt football recon-
struction project took a few
giant steps backwards on
Saturday,  the Virginia
Tech Hokies whipped the
Panthers 45-7.

“They have an excellent
football team,” head coach
Johnny Majors said. “We
were whipped physically by
people who have outstanding
talent and are certainly a
well—coached team.”

Virginia Tech won the coin
toss and never looked back.
Pitt’s first two possessions,
under the leadership of John
Ryan (7 completions in 12
attempts for 65 yards and
one interception), ended
after three plays each and
two Nate Cochran punts.
Cochran’s second punt went
36 yards and was returned to
the Pitt 18. That was where
the Hokies went to work.

Maurice DeShazo (16-29,
183) threw the first touch-
down of the game, a four-
yard pass to senior Antonio
Freeman. Freeman tip-toed

as he beat Anthony Dorsett
for six points.

Two possessions later, Pitt
engineered its best drive of

the first half, as the Panthers
drove to the Virginia Tech 30
after a Billy West 21-yard
run. The Pitt drive stalled
after a delay-of-game penal-

ty, and Cochran was forced
to punt again.

Virginia Tech started its
next drive on its own 20 and
drove 60 yards in 15 plays,
which resulted in a Ryan
Williams 37-yard field goal.
Williams suffered a child-
hood injury that severed half
of his kicking foot, .but he
has still managed to be suc-
cessful for the Hokies.

After two more Cochran
punts, DeShazo and the
Hokies’ offense went to
work again. After DeShazo
hooked up with Bryan Still
for 42 yards, tailback
Dwayne Thomas took it in
from two yards out to give
Virginia Tech a 17-0 lead
with five minutes left to play
in the half.

“We just didn’t have
enough ammunition for a
strong running game, an

Pitt soccer falls in overtime -0 against No. 14 Red Storm

By Brett Fondrk
Staff Writer

So close, yet so far.
The old cliche used count-
less times to describe numer-
ous sports seasons through
the ages is the proper adage
to describe the misfortunes
of the Pitt soccer team this
year. It caught up to the
Panthers again this weekend
as they fell to the No. 14-
ranked St. John’s Red Storm
3-0 in overtime.

The Red Storm’s Ben
Hickey’s long shot off a
direct free kick proved to be
the game winner, as Pitt fell
to, 7'—7 and 1-6 in the Big
East. —

The booming shot from the
right side five minutes into
the first overtime sailed
over a diving Kirk Brodows
and found the upper left cor-
ner of the net. The goal
essentially buried the
Panthers.

“It was a career shot,” Pitt
assistant Chris Karwoski said
of the goal.

“He really cracked it.
It looked like it was on
a rope. I doubt that he
could ever hit one like that
again.”

Hickey’s shot came after a
foul was called on Pitt
forward Todd Graf. The
ensuing penalty resulted in a
direct free kick from 25

yards out.

“It was a mental lapse,”
Karwoski said.

“But I’m not pointing a
finger at Todd, he played a
great game.”

The goal seemingly took
a lot out of the Panthers,
who had played one of
the top teams in the
nation even for the first 90
minutes.

“I ‘thought that we played
really well,” midfielder Jeff
Porter said.

“We had some chances in
regulation.” ,

Dean Astorino and J.L.
Gorsin both had headers
that either missed the net or
were cleared away at the last
second. But at the end of
regulation, the teams were
tied "as they headed into the
mandatory two overtime
periods.

St. John’s scored its
next goal in the second over-
time. Carlton Carter found
the back of the net when
he shot out of a crowd in

front of the net after
Brodows had come out to
play the ball.

But Carter wasn’t finished,
as he scored again off a cor-
ner kick from the left side
with a perfectly placed head-
er.

“Kirk came out to play it
and he just beat him in the
air,” Karwoski said. “He

really skied. I‘couldn’t
believe how high he
jumped.”

Brodows had a busy day as

he faced 23 shots and had to
make 14 saves.

“Kirk played really well,”
Porter said. “He faced_a

ton of shots because they
take shots from any-
where. It’s just their style of
play.” V

And unfortunately for
Pitt, one too many of
them found the back of the
net.

It’s been the story all sea-
son long. A few tough breaks
have been the difference
between a .500 team and the
playoffs.

“We played well for 90
minutes,” Karwoski said.
“It’s just been that kind of
season. But we played so
well that everyone is still
upbeat.”

Wednesday, Pitt faces a
tough West Virginia team at
Pitt Stadium.

“We scrimmaged them last
year, and they were teally
big and physical. They are
similar to Bucknell,” he said.
“It’s going to be another
tough game.”

With four games remain-
ing, Pitt will try to salvage
the season and finish with a
winning record.

“If we win the last four,
we’re ll-7,” Karwoski
said. “Most people would
consider that t_o be a great
season.

“I think that we’ve played
good all year,” Porter said.
“But it’s been tough. A few
bounces our way and we’re
in the playoffs.” ’

§l-lokies dominate in all face

By Ed Ziegenfuss
Staff Writer

Pitt was a victim once again
as Virginia Tech exploded in
every aspect of the game to
defeat the Panthers handily 45-
7.

The Panthers entered
Blacksburg, Va., with high
h o p e s
after see-
ing their
o w n
o ffe n s e
e r u p t
against
W e s t
Virginia one week ago.
However, the only fireworks
belonged to Virginia Tech.

Offensively, Tech’s 364
yards out gained the Panthers
by 108 yards, but the game
was not that close. A lot of
Pitt’s yardage came in the
fourth quarter against the
Hokies’ second unit.

Virginia Tech rushed the ball
successfully, gaining 152
yards against an injury-

. plagued Pitt defense. Dwayne

Thomas led the Hokies with
82 yards and two touchdowns.
The longest rush of the day for-
Virginia Tech was a 19-yard
scamper by Marcus Parker.

“We are a team that is pretty
well battered up,” head coach
John Majors said. “They have
an excellent football team.
They are one of the best teams
in the country.”

In the air, Hokies quarter-
back Maurice DeShazo com-
pleted 16 of 24 passes for 183
yards and two touchdowns.

yards and downing one punt
on the Pitt one-yard line.

Defensively, Virginia Tech
was fired up and it showed.
The Hokies stymied the Big
East leading rusher Billy West
for only 75 yards. The
Panthers were held to 128

yards on the ground for the
day, six yards more than
West’s rushing average. The
only two substantial rushing
plays the Panthers could come
up with were a 38-yard run by
Chris Patton and a 28-yard
reverse by wide receiver
Dietrich Jells on a handoff
from West.

Senior linebacker Ken
Brown led the way for the
Hokies with nine tackles
including one quarterback sack
and one forced fumble.
Sophomore free safety
Antonio Banks also recorded
nine tackles for Virginia Tech.

tackles, six solo, and four for
total losses of 21 yards for the
Hokies. Semones also caused
two fumbles, both coming on
sacks.

The Hokies’ pass defense
was outstanding, as Pitt’s trio
of quarterbacks could only
throw for 130 yards. John
Ryan threw for 65 yards and
one interception, Sean
Fitzgerald tossed for 12 yards
and Pete Gonzalez racked up
53 yards passing.

The Virginia Tech defense
forced Pitt into three plays and

’ a punt seven times on the

afternoon. Nate Cochran punt-
ed 10 times for a total of 421
yards, giving him an average
of 42.1 yards for the game.
“We’re down because we
know we are better than we

‘ played,” Simpson said. “The

coaches come up with great
schemes, it’s just somehow we
can’t put it together. We have
the talent to be good.”

“We were whipped physical-
ly,” Majors said. “Our young
men fought hard, so we have a
lot of improvement to be

i made, because we do have an

opportunity to win next week.”

had thrown an interception
the previous possession.
Fitzgerald did not provide
any help to the struggling
Panther offense, as once
again it was three plays and
punt for Pitt.

After a good return by
Freeman and a five—yard
facemask penalty, Thomas
scored again from three
yards out, giving the Hokies
a 24-0 lead at the half.

“[Thomas] had some good
moves,” Pitt linebacker
Gerald Simpson said.

It was easy to see how
Virginia Tech had built up
such a big lead in the first
half. The average starting
field position for the Hokies
was their own 46, as
opposed to Pitt’s starting
average on its own 16-yard
line. Virginia Tech also out-
gained the Panthers 306
yards to 114.

“Their kicking game was a
big factor,” Majors said.
“They whipped us on the
kicking game with their
kickoffs, placement game
and their punting.”

The second half was more
of the same as Pitt continued
to struggle.

Fitzgerald, who was still at
quarterback, drove the
Panthers to one first down
and then three plays and a
punt. Cochran’s punt was
fielded by Freeman at his
own 20-yard line, and he
didn’t stop until he had gone
80 yards for the touchdown.

Once again, Pitt could
muster nothing offensively
and was forced to give the
ball back to Tech. A nine-
play, 72-yard drive was fin-
ished off by DeShazo hitting
fullback Brian Edmonds for
a six-yard touchdown strike.

Three plays later, Billy
West fumbled and Torrian
Gray" recovered for the
Hokies. On the very next
play, backup quarterback
Jim Druckenmiller threw a
21-yard scoring pass to
freshman tailback,Marcus
Parker to make the score 45-
0 Hokies.

The only offense of the
day for Pitt was delivered by

third-string signal—cal1er
Pete Gonzalez. Gonzalez
completed four of six for 53
yards. He scored Pitt’s only
touchdown on a 12-yard
scamper up the middle. The
touchdown, the first of
Gonzalez’s collegiate career,
was set up by a 38-yard run
by Chris Patton and a 28-
yard run on a reverse by
Dietrich Jells.

“My offensive line really
looked at me with confi-
dence,” Gonzalez said. ‘‘I
felt that with their confi-
dence, I could make things

Majors ﬂashed Fitzgerald until
midway through the fourth
quarter, when he brought back
Gonzalez for the rest of the
game.

With Gonzalez now tossed
in the quarterback game, it will
definitely raise the stakes and
confuse the bettors’ dilating
eyes even more, while they try

Following Gonzalez’s
touchdown, the Pitt defense
made a stand and forced the
Hokies to punt. Gonzalez
came back on and led the
Panthers on a 12—play drive
that was completed by
Cochran’s 10th punt of the
game. Cochran ended the
day averaging 42 yards on

Panthers dropped their
only game,'the second, 15-
7.

“I thought we thoroughly
beat this team,” Alvear said.
“Stephanie Dufresne, our
setter, was without question
outstanding.”

For Dufresne, who had
43 assists, it was only a mat-
ter of being focused, and
from there everything was
perfect. Or at least almost
perfect.

“We didn’t pass well
[in the second game],”
Dufresne said. “We weren’t
ball-handling very well
either.”

The disgraceful .018 team
hitting percentage of the
Mountaineers was indicative
of their play.

On the other side of
the net, it was the .555
hitting percentage of junior
outside hitter Sarah
Mikla that led Pitt to a
team total of .318 percent-
age.

“We played well overall,”
Laurie Fernandez, a sopho-
more outside hitter, said. “I
don’t think I played very
well, though I had some
good digs.”

For the Lady Panthers,
the second game was a
speed bump. It slowed
them down but didn’t

stop them, and as game
hree began, they picked
up momentum and left
the Mountaineers far
behind.

Taking a quick 3-0 lead,
Pitt started to pull away 6-1
after West Virginia called a
timeout.

It would take another time-
out to try and come back
after being down 9-2, but the
Lady'Panthers were too

strong and ended the game.

15-2.

In game four,
West Virginia rallied to
pull within one early in the
game, 3-2. It would be the
last time the Mountaineers
would score a point in the
match.

According to Alvear, it is a
goal for her team to be con-
sistent and play in a solid
rhythm.

Good, consistent play
was provided by senior
middle hitter Melanie
Gustafson, who had 12 kills
and recorded a .526 hitting
percentage. »

This is the type of consis-
tent play and teamwork
that has kept the Lady
Panthers undefeated in Big
East play.

“When we take care of our
side of the court, we are a
very, very good team,”
Alvear said.
