eds will answer the call of ‘
the road and “bum” their way
to the Heinz House to the
“Hobo Party" of the junior

fer students will be honor
guests.

The old comradeship of the
box-car will blend into the
the atmosphere of old clothes,

Inquiry,‘ Club Hears Talk A
On Nature of Progress

. ' — is
', Before the largest Inquiry 
gatheri ’
H. Gold
Sholem Temple, gave his 'views
Wednesday on the “Nature and
Meaning of Progress.” Dr. Golden-
son. ,.was introduced by J. James
Moore, Ed. '32, newly chosen pres-
ident of the club. ,

-. Goldensoafs talk revolved it-
so f around the imitations, chara-
teristics, and the aims of-p-rogress.
Substitutions for progress, said Dr.
Goldenson, are changes and‘ evolu-
tion, but neither of these is syn-
onymous with progress. ,

The three characteristics of
progress were given I as perman-
ence, universal appeal, and depth
in meaning. Things‘ which would
be considered progress should be
measured by these yardsticks,
‘said Dr. Goldenson. The present
disappointment in thd Western
world is due to the lack of ideals
which are, the motive powers of
progress.

The Inquiry Club meeting for
Wednesday, November 24, has
been cancelled due to preparations
for the Thanksgiving vacation. At
the next meeting‘ of the club on
December 2, Dr-. Bryan Hovde,
associate professor, will speak on
“The Manchurian" Question.”

Frock “Scrub Clothes’ ’
For students, to Keep
C Expense Slate Clean

Welcome ‘news for out-of-
town studedts who are living
‘in Pittsburgh, or how ‘can we
help ‘you to economize! This,
might be termed the theme of
the new “Laundry Service
Company” established for Pitt
students by Mortimer Jacob-
son and William Burman; two
freshmen in the college.

This idea. is an entirely new
one here. It took the boys, aid-
ed by Mr. Whited, head of the
Student Employment Bureau,
three weeks to organize the
system, and they are now
ready to begin business. Your
laundry will be called for, and
delivered 15 per cent cheaper
than the present "‘cash and"
carry" rates.

Experienced men have been
engaged to do the work, and
satisfaction is guaranteed, For
the .-preseiit, Jacobson and Bur-
man will confine their opera-
tions to students living close t
to the University. However .
they will expand their busi-
ness when they are equippe
to handle more work. —*

Expected to Figure
In Discussion

 

A mass meeting of all Pitt frat-
ernity women will be held in
Heinz House, next Monday, Nov-
ember 30, the fifth hour, to intro-
duce the first annual Pitt Pan-
hellenic Conference Week, as a
clearinghouse for important inter-
fraternity issues. ,

' Bid Day will probably _ figure
largely in the discussion. since
‘ several women's fraternities ques-
tinned its inauguration. The con-
ference as a whole, however, will
be devoted to more inclusive
‘problems of fraternity values and
relations. .

After the mass meeting on Mon-
day, during which the Women's
Fraternity Committee, composed
of Dean of Women Thrysa W.
Amos, Mrs. Lotte Lohstoeter,

Jliss Ellen M. Geyer, and Miss

_ O Blossom'Henry, will present their

chairmanship of Bessie Rader, Col.
'32, will meet Tuesday evening to
consider the relations of the fra-

On Wednesday, at 3:30, Scholar-
ship‘ Chairmen will convene for a

ternity officers will also meet in
groups with women from each
fraternity leading the discussions.

On Thursday, December 3, Pan-

“Pitt is probably the only Uni-
versity which has set aside a
Conference week for the discus-
sion of the Panhellenic problems
_1vhich are so vitally important to
the college student; we hope that
the Conference will accomplish so
much to better inter-fraternity re-

Says

Professor Johnson About Chinese Situation

 

“Japan is not seeking a conquest of Manchuria, ‘but a set-
tlement of the dispute there over the Japanese rights under the
treaty of 1915,” stated Roswell H. Johnson, professor of oil and
gas production, in an interview this week. Professor Johnson
recently returned from a _lecture tour of twenty-one Japanese
cities, as the representative of the American Eugenio Society.

“These Japanese rights, Professor Johnson stated, “are

now being contested by the Chi¢ -

mese, who allege that the signature
of the President of China was pro-
cured by duress and that the

treaty’s ratification by the Chinese
parliament, necessary -for its valid-
ity. was never procured, and that
on the contrary their government
has repeatedly udlenounced the
treaty.

“The Japanese, on the - other
hand, contend that the government
in question was only a provisional
government and that President
Yuan was substantially a dictator.
Furthermore, they say, the passage
of sixteen years with the Japanese
in possession makes it too late to
raise technicalities as to the adop-
tion of the treaty, especially in
view of the.verY heavy investment
of capital by the Japanese during
this period.”

Professor Johnson maintains. ‘He
is ﬁrmly convinced that the points
of difference are not far enough
apart for the countries to resort
to war for settlement, and that di-
plomacy will soon put an end to
the disagreement.

Asked why the League of Nations
has favored China, Professor John-
son replied that this was due to
Japanese soldiers leaving the rail-
road zone,- supposedly after being
provoked .-by Chinese soldiers.

Russia's entrance into the possi-
ble conﬂict Professor Johnson ruled
out as highly improbable. “The ad-
vantages to the ‘Soviet Union of re-
maining at peace are paramount
because of their intense desire to
complete their industrialization pro-

conclwdled.

Medical Candidates Take
Mental Tests Dec. 2

Chancellor John G. Bowman ap-
pointed Omar Held, personnel di-
rector in the college, as chairman
of the Mental Aptitude tests to be
given to pre-med students on De-
cember 2. Mr. Held’s appointment
came as a result of a communica-
tion from the Association of Amer-
ican Colleges recommending med-
ical tests. —

Dean L. P. Sieg and the Depart-
ment of Research in Higher Edu-
cation had charge of the work last

 

 

,year and proved very satisfactory

to the Association. The invitation
to conduct similar tests this year
came as a result of last year's
work. Mr. Held will have the co-
operation of the psychology 'de-
partment in conducting the tests.

The tests will be held in Ban-
quet Hall of Memorial Hall on De-
cember 7. The tests are to deter-
mine whether or not students have
the mental ability to enter various
medical schools throughout the
country.

While bellboys scampcred through the corridors and taxi-
cab hrakes shrieked outside, Dr. Reinhold Niebuhr, associate
editor of “The VVor1d Tomorrow,” and professor at Colum-
bia University, lounged in a Webster Hall drawing room and

condemned college students in

America as “irresponsible, de-

“Co11ege life, to American students, is four years of country

club existence’? he said placidly.¢
“College belongs to the standard

life of a certain group, it seems.
It is the standard of a thought-
less, irresponsible group of joy-
seeking students who go to col-
lege because it’s ‘just the thing’
or because all the rest pf the
‘kids\ on their block go. Irrespon-
sibility is the by-product of the
American college life, and it's
bad business.

“The younger generation in the
colleges today, is not hypocritical
because it has nothing to be hypo-
critical about. It has no standards
of anything and its frankness, so
loudly praised by tabloids and noi-
sy magazines is the result of -this
lack of moral standards. They have
nopattern of life at all. not even a
crazy one. And Heaven knows a
crazy pattern is -better than none
at all! Their pleasures are illusions
their thoughts are steeped in sens-
ual pragmatism for the gratifica-
tion of flighty desires, and! their
-studies are things‘ rather to be
avoided than pursued.

Will Seek Exchange of
Fraternity Ideas

 

The President’s Council of Pan-
hellenic Association, which con-
sists of the seventeen presidents
of the women's fkaternities on the

campus, will start their eighth
year of serving to bring about
mutual exchange of ideas among
the fraternities, at Heinz House
on November 24.

“The President’s Council rose
to meet the need for communica-
tion with the women on the camp-
us and to help solve their prob-
lems,” explains Miss Helen Rush,
assistant to the dean of women.

“Supplementing the work of the
Panhellenic Association, the Presi-
dent’s Council, which.originated at
the University of Pittsburgh, has
proven so successful that the
Council has been adopted in other
colleges throughout the country.”

The topic for the ‘first Round
Table conference of this year will
be “Manners.” The discussion will
be led by Eleanor Doescher, Ed.
’32, and Harriet Davies, Ed. '32.

Sarah Moore, Ed. ’32, at the
next meeting of the President’s
Council which will be held Decem-
ber 1 at Heinz House, will lead
a discussion on “The Ways of
Dealing with the Non-Conformists
in the Groups.” This discussion
will be given in connection with
a program planned,by Panhellenic
for Panhellenic Week.

New officers for this’ year are
Bessie Rader, Ed. ’32, president,
and Marion McCartney, Ed. ’32,
secretary treasurer. “

Two Changes Made in
Old Housing Contracts

Another step forward in the field
of student housing has been ac-
complished with the issuance of
new housing contracts. There are
two radical changes is this new
form distinguishing it from the
old: first, the contracts are drawn
up for only one year; second, a
formal certificate of approval is
given to the landlord.

The old contracts which were
continuous, did not have the ad-
vantage of keeping the bureau in
touch with the householder which
the new one-year agreements pos-
sess. The formal certificate. of ap-
proval to be displayed in the house
‘makes it easier for the student
searching for rooms.

The landlords must apply for
approved rating for t‘ ‘ following
school term on or bvtore July 1.-
Contracts have been awarded only
to renters within the limits of
Neville street to McKee place, and
Dawson street to Bryn Mawr
road.

All freshmen are now staying in
residences approved for this term.

 
  

Welcome Given Them Here’

Cadets Enthusiastic Over ‘

By Thomas B. Cummings
As the last of the four special
trains, carrying its quota of the
cadet companies, slowly puffed
out of the P. & L. E. R. R. sta-

tion early Sunday morning, and
gathering speed, quickly disap-
peared into the darkness, thous-
ands of Pittsburghers quietly Wend-
ed their way homeward after
having watched eagerly beside the
station entrance gates, from rail-
ings of the Smithfield street
bridge, corner nooks, and ordinari-
ly inaccessible places, the approach
of the 1,400 West Point cadets
from places scattered throughout
the city.

It had been a gala day for Pitts-
burgh, and a proud day for the
University, and a not-to-be-forgot-
ten day for grey-blue clad cadets.
It was the first time this year
that the entire corps at West
Point had travelled westward
from the campus of the United
States Military Academy high
above the Hudson, For some, it
was the first visit
since their matriculation months
ago. To others, the trip meant the
release, for a few hours, from ar-
duous tasks. To all of them, came
a feeling of regret for having to
leave such kindness, warmth of
welcome, and thoughtfulness as
were accorded them during their
stay in Pittsburgh.

“It will be a long time before
I forgot this week-end as guest
of the city of Pittsburgh and Pitt,”
commented Cadet Ronald Flitter,
Corporal, “M" company, before
boarding his train “You can tell
everyone that Pi has reason to
be proud, not only for having such
a splendid football team, but for

Hospitality Unequaled

Cadet William R. Smith, Cap-
tain “G” company, son of Major-
General William R. Smith, com-
manding officer at the Military
Academy, and whose home is in
Honolulu, Hawaii, guest at the
Kappa Sigma house, remarking on
the day at Pittsburgh had the fol-
lowing to say. “This is my last
year at the United States Academy
at West Point, and I have made
several trips to witness football
games. No place can equal Pitts-
burgh in its hospitality. It was
wonderful, and although we were
beaten by Pitt, our disappoint-
ment has been tempered by the
Way we have been entertained.”

"1 have been at West Point for
ove_r a year, and my trip to Pitts-
burgh is the first one outside of
the grounds for me,” remarked
Cadet Lloyd Fellenv, of San An-
tonio, Texas. “It will be hard for

.any city that may entertain us to
anywhere '

surpass your warm welcome. I am
already looking forward to next
year's grid contest, and wish you
and your team the best of luck.”

Cadet Ralph Shaw, first class-
man, Company “G” who received
his appointment to West Point in
competitive examination against
other regular enlisted men, re-
marked, “I don't believe I could
have had a better time. I am sorry
that I must leave before I have
had hardly any time to meet you,
but I do say, ‘Welcome next year
to West Point)"

Not only the cadets were enthus-
lastic over the welcome given
them during their short stay in
Pittsburgh. Lt. Colonel Walter J.

Wilson, who had charge of the

General William R. Smith, had
the following to say, “The officers
as well as the cadets of the Unit-
ed States Military Academy are
enthusiastic over the treatment,
accorded them by the citizens of)
Pittsburgh and the faculty and

students of the University of
Pittsburgh. The Wholehearted
welcome was an inspiration to

every officer and cadet in the par-
ty.”
Guests at Luncheon

From the time of detrainment
at 9:30 Saturday morning until
the last train began its journey
to West Point at 1:20 Sunday
morning, the cadets were in a con-
stant whirl of activity. Beginning
with the review parade in the
morning, through the luncheon at
the Syria Mosque as guests of the
University at noon, the maneuvers
and football game at the stadium
in the afternoon, after which a din-
ner and dance at the William
Penn Hotel,-or dinner as guests of
campus fraternities and an eve-
ning of varying entertainment,
the West Point corps had a lively
time while in Pittsburgh.

Leaving Pittsburgh, and before
arriving at West Point, the cadets
detrained at Niagara Falls where
an hour stopover was made at
noon. The corps detrained at the
United States Military Academy,
West Point, at 5:30 Sunday eve-
ning.

As the last of the special trains
was disappearing in the darkness,
four stalwart cadets, gathered on
the platform of the end coach,
doffed their military caps to the
crowd gathered on the platform
and waved farewell.’

 The Campus ,
  1 Scout Says:

' One more game and then our football predicting days will be over

for the rest of our school life. Although this may seem to be a rather

1 7early farewell, we feel that there has been more grief connected with
‘ such ob‘se_rvat.ions than reward.

 * ‘For no reason at all, we undertook the task of forecasting results
at the beginning of the 1930 football season in accordance with a pre-
cedent established two years previous to that time by the original Cam-
pus Scout. During his last year at the task, he had predicted the win-

_ ners in each of the Pitt games during the regularseason (Pitt had an
I fundefeated team) although his forecast of the post-season tilt with
A Southern California at the Tournament of Roses was something like
« I. 400 per cent wrong. '

l_.u'ck, as you'may call it, was with us for the first ‘four
,‘‘-(.games. West Virginia was beaten 16-O after a prediction of 27-
7. Western Reserve succumbed 52-0 with the prediction being.
47-0., And Syracuse fell before Pitt by the same score as that
forecast, 14-0.

‘-After that everything went blue, and predictions wentfrom

bad to worse. Two chosen victors took it on the chin and the
-game with Nebraska ended in a scoreless tie after we had
thought Pitt two touchdowns better. Raspberries ‘were ripe at
the time, and we decided that no more would the uilefull stu-
dents be presented opportunities to take advantage of well
meaning but somewhat misleading indications of future events.

.-.; Time passes and with it the inevitable start of another gridiron
 . “season which again ﬁnds me in the same familiar place in the Activities
Building. The‘ old urge returns and wit it comesvanother attempt to
. ‘foretell the results of a Pitt football ga e in advance. ~
 - ' If you are a faithful reader of this section, you will know that the
 predictions for the minor games have not been so good but those for
the first four major games were what you might call hunky-dory. The
a past two major games, however, have given me somewhat of a. head-
. ’_"”a.che. One result was due, perhaps, to a peculiar temperamental condi-
- tion in which the players entered a game; and while there was no par-
ticular excuse for the bum prediction made for the Army game last
, ’- week. We conceded the Panthers a bigger edge in the game than any
‘ other writer we know of.
7 \About the only way in which one can prove his standing is
by/figures, so we have brought back the old method in use last
year to determine our percentage. The method is simply this.
Divide the difference in the score between the two teams and
the difference predicted. Add the quotient’ to the quotient ob-
tained by dividing the number of points scored in the game into
the number predicted, or vice versa. Divide the final sum by
two and then duck. ‘

, In case this method seems somewhat compIicated,~we will
I‘II"ustrate its usae as applied to the final result of the Pitt-West
\_/_lrginia game. The final score of that game was 34-0, while
we predicted an ending of 41-7. Dividing the difference in the

score between the two teams, 34, and that predicted, also 34,
we obtain 1. We also divide the number of points scored in the
game, 34, by the number which we forecasted, 48,, which leaves
us with a, result of 1.708; and dividing this sum by two leaves
us ‘.854 or a percentage of 85.4 for that game.

' As this matter is now clear, we furnish here the ﬁgures for all Pitt
‘ gamesvwith major opponents:

. Notre Dame (13/14 plus 26/37) divided by 2 equals .816.

Penn State (34/35 plus 34/47) divided by 2 equals .847.
Carnegie Tech (8/26 plus 20-/26) divided by 2 equals .539.
Army (15/26 plus 26/27) divided by 2 equals .770.

> Adding all results together we have an answer of 4.826 and
dividing this by 6, the number of games considered, we have a
ﬁnal result of .804, or a percentage of 80.4. «Down in New York,
one of the daily papers forces its sports writers to earn their

- daily bread with predictions as to the outcome of the major

-- games each week-end. Last year, the best man had a percent-
age of 56.6. Hey, Kallfelz, how about a raise!

And since we have picked the winners for all the games
this year, we might help the Panthers’ claim to the Eastern
football championship by picking. Yale to beat the now unde-
feated, untied Harvard eleven when the two meet tomorrow
afternoon. . I

Incidentally, a Yale victory is not beyond the realms of probability.

If you look over the records‘ of the two teams to date, you will notice
a that in their battles with the same opponents, there has been very little
difference in the ﬁnal results.

Both Harvard and Yale played Army and Dartmouth. Harvard
beat both of these teams by one point margin, while the Elis played tie
games with them. On the strength of these performances Harvard
should bethe favorite to win by Barry Wood’s educated toe.

Yale, however, will enter the game in a better mental. con-
dition than its opponents. This being Eddie Casey’s first year
as head coach at the Crimson school, a great deal has been
written about the possibilities of his men going through their
entire schedule without suffering a defeat or a tie.

« The ballyhoo was started rather early with the result that
there has been a great strain upon the Harvard players who are
anxious to come through for their coach. An overwhelming
favorite over Dartmouth, Harvard barely eked out a 7-6 victory
on a forward pass in the last four minutes of play. The pass
was the third in. a series of downs, the ﬁrst two having been
incomplete. '

. ‘ ,

In its game with Holy Cross last week, Harvard scored 7 points in
the first quarter but was forced to cling closely to thisllead when its
later attempts to dent the defense of the Catholics proved ineffective.

In addition, Army, which was defeated by Harvard, 14-13, scored all
its points in the ﬁrst quarter after which Coach Major Sasse of the
Cadets substituted his second team backﬁeld for his ﬁrst string one
with the result that Harvard scored two touchdowns during the time
when the ﬁrst team backs sat on the bench, a number which proved
sutlicient to insure the Crimson a victory.

Harvard is due to fall, and Yale with two weeks of rest be-
hind it since its last game with St. John's, a minor opponent, is
a likely looking team to accomplish this end. And don't forget
that little Albie Booth and his Yale mates are eager to avenge
those Harvard two touchdown victories of the past two seasons.
Yale was the favorite in each of these games, but Barry Wood
threw two long passes over the center of the line down into
AIbIe's territory both times to score those sacred points.

Tomorrow, Albie will have his last chance to score a vic-
tory over a varsity Harvard football team. If you think his team
can't do it, you better not bet. And from this corner, we’ll
pick the Elis, 16-13. .

' Grid Title

Brilliant Play I In Army
Game Ranks Panthers
With East's Best

Pitt's conclusive 26-0 victory
over the Army last Saturday ‘sent
the Panther’s stock in the East
soaring to its highest level since
shortly after the beginning of the
season, and -set the locals in line
for honorable mention is the chase
for national honors,

Harvard, which remains the
only undefeated and untied eleven
in the East, stands together with
Pitt at the top of the list of east-
ern teams. The Crimson squeezed

 

 

out a 7-0 victory over a stubborn

Holy Cross aggregation last Sat-

urday to keep its record clean.
However, they meet their acid
test tomorrow when they cele-

brate the golden jubilee of foot-
ball relations between Yale and
Harvard by, meeting the Blue on
the gridiron. This is the last game
of the season for Harvard and is
probably the toughest, as the‘ Eli
have been developing steadily since
the beginning of the season, rested
up last Saturday, and are in prime
shape, ready to hand their ancient
rivals a classic licking.
Harvard Holds Key

If Harvard loses tomorrow, and
Pitt should win its game with
Nebraska which is very likely,
Pitt would be recognized as east-
ern champs. Even if Harvard wins
however, Pitt may be handed the
crown. The fashion in which the
Panthers demolished the Army
compared with the bare 14-13 win
the Crimson eked out over the
soldiers turns the opinion of crit-
ics to the locals.

Two major eastern elevens who
had a perfect record met with
their first defeats last Saturday,
eliminating them both from chanc-
es for the eastern crown. ‘Colgate
high-powered the rugged Syracuse
line into a submissive defeat, 21-7,
while Dartmouth’s great passing
combination of Morton and Mc-
Call and a determined Big Green
line beat Cornel, 14-0. In other
games--*N'e’w York University neu-
tralized Fordham in a scoreless
tie, and Columbia nosed out Brown,

Sectional Champs

The undefeated leaders of sec-
tional football have resolved them-
selves into Tulane and Tennessee
in the South, Harvard in the
East, Notre Dame and Northwest-
ern in the Middle West, and South-
ern Methodist in the Southwest.
On the Pacific Coast Southern
California, with an early season
defeat by St. Mary’s spotting its
record, is now generally recogniz-
ed as the strongest eleven. '

Of these elevens Harvard, Notre
Dame and Southern California are
likely to meet defeat tomorrow.
Harvard is far from a heavy favor-
ite over Yale while the Ramblers
and the Trojans come up against

VVAQRE/V HELLER

The famous forward passing duo of Heller and'Reider gave an al-
most-perfect exhibition of aerial work at the Pitt-Army game last week
in the stadium. Each scored a touchdown on a pass from the other,
while several other passes excuted by the two resulted iniong gains

for the Panthers.

Rocco Cutri, substitute Panther quarterback and Heller’s room-
mate, also held the spotlight after he had entered the ame for the

injured Hogan.

Cutri caught a pass from Heller and ran forty yards

through a broken field for the Panther’s third touchdown.

Boxers Show
At Y Forum

F i g h t e r s Demonstrate
Talk By Orsini,

 

 

Pitt’s boxers were well received
by an enthusiastic men's forum at
the Downtown Y. M, C. A. on
Tuesday night, the largest attend-
ance at a forum being present. Mr.
W. T. Rowe, of the Y. KM. C, A.,
was host to the boxers and express-
ed himself as pleased with the
showing made by the Panthers.
“Boxing, especially in the ama-
teur sense, is a fine sport, and the
Pitt boys certainly looked good to
me,” said Mr. Rowe after the
demonstrations.

.The boxers made their appear-
ance after Prof. John Dambach,
head of the department of physi-
cal education at the University
and the guest speaker of the eve-
ning, had spoken. They served as
illustrations for points mentioned
by Joe'Orsini, coach of the Pitt
team, his talk being simultaneous
with the bouts.

Five bouts were put on, each
lasting for three one and one-half
minute rounds. The fighters were
Meyer Mersky and Frank Jasper

in the 125 pound -class; Len
‘Harris and Bus Mawhinney in
the 145 pound class; Rand

Newbyfand Lew Rakita
middleweight class, Bill Evans and
Tom Passafume in the 135 pound
division, and Henry Martin and
Matty Rubbo in the welterweight
class. __

Tonight the fighters will give‘
another demonstration at a smok-
er being held by the School of
Mines in the Activities Building.

each other. The other three are
almost sure to come through the
rest of the, season successfully.
Tulane seems the likely nominee
for the Rose Bowl game New
Years Day. Tennessee can be rul-
ed out as it plays on the Pacific
Coast only a short time before
New Years. If Tulane would refuse
the probable bid, the Rose Bowl
Tournament officials might turn
to Pitt as the next candidate. ,

Five Man. Team Makes
Score of 1337

 

With the initial meet of the sea-
son scheduled with Johns Hopkins
University for next week, the Pitt
varsity rifle team has been work-
ing hard during the past few days
to polish off its rough shooting and
to give a good acount of itself in
the lid-lifter. L

So far this year, the team has
idii-splayed satisfactory form and has
produced comparatively few low
scores. Although the improvement
of the team has not been astonish-

In Final Meetl

Varsity, Frosh Squads
Tangle For the City
Championship

 

 

This afternoon at three o'clock
the Pitt varsity and freshman cross
country. teams will meet the harri-
ers of Carnegie Tech in dual meets
to be held in Schenley Park for the
city championship. The varsity
meet will be run over the regular
5%,. mile course and will be preced-
ed by the freshman race which will
be run over the regular freshman
course. These meets will ‘be the,fi-
nal ones of the season for both Pitt
teams.

The varsity meet promises to be
the best of the year. Both teams
lost to West Virginia, the only team
both have met, by approximately
the same score which indicates
that both teams are about equal in
strength. Added to this, the usual
Pitt-Tech rivalry makes the final
outcome even more uncertain.

Olise, Price Duel

Clise of Pitt and Price of Tech
are expected to stage an individual
battle for first place.

No comparisons can be made be-
tween the fresh teams, but a close
-battle is expected Fresh from a
victory over the Penn State frosh,
the Pitt frosh are determinedl not
to let a defeat spoil a good record.

The varsity barriers bowed to the
Army team last Saturday morning
‘by a score of 18-37. Northam proved
to be the star of the day. He step-
ped over the 4%.-mile course in 24:-
17 to set a new record for this
course.

=Clise Finishes Third

Although he pushed them all the
way. Clise, Pitt ace, was not equal
to the occasion and was forced to
follow both Northam and Slaidle a-
cross the finish line. Army amassed
their total by placing men first, «sec-
ond, fourth, fifth, and sixth while
Pitt men finished third, seventh,
eighth, ninth, and tenth.

ing, it has sl-own steady progres-s
and before many weeks have passed
will probably be at its peak.

At the beginning of the vear
some of the men could not master
the correct form, but under the pa-
tient instruction of Lieutenant Wil-
son and Sergeant Gunter, they fin-
aly have begun to hit consistently
high scores. The big guns of the
team have been turning in fairly
high kneeling scores.

The extent to which the team
has improved, as a whole, is shown
by the scores of this year and last.
Last year, the best score turned in
during the entire season for three
events by a five man team was
1431. La-st week, the five highest
shooters turned in a. count of 1337.
Considering how young the season
is, that total is unusually high. Wil-
son, Backen, Wuertenberger, Geier,
and Taussig compriseidl the team
that turned in the 1337 scores.

December 8 has been set as a ten-

It has been the custom in the past
few years for the Pitt winner to
‘compete with the winner of the
West Virginia University tourna-

procedure will be followed this
year. Pi Lambidia Phi, winner of the
Pitit cup two years ago, and Delta
Sigma Phi, last year’s winner,
both defeated the West Virginia
teams.

Matches will be decided on the

- The Women's Debating Associa-
tion staged its first debate of the
season Monday afternoon when
they presented a. no-decision argu-
ment on the season's subject, “Re-
solved: That the Federal Govern-
ment Should Enact Legislation
Providing for Centralized’ Control
of Industry," before the Bellevue
League of Women Voters at the
Memorial Library, Bellevue.

Marire Cornman,‘ Ed. '33, and Lo-
uise Linn, Ed. ’32, discussed the
affirmative side of the question.
while Marjorie Haﬁson, Col. '34,
and Genevieve Blatt, Col. ’33, argued
in favor of the negative. The same
squad debated before the high
school assembly at Burgettstown
yesterday afternoon. I

Popular Subject

In commenting upon the associa-
tion’s plans for this year, Gene-
vieve Blatt, Col. ’33, president, says,
“Since the subject we have chosen
for this year’s debate is of such
general interest, and is popular
among college debaters in the
South and West, we expect to use
it quite extensively. despite the
fact that the squad this year is of

companaltlvely new material.”

The Association will hold.a din-

Batchelder Honor Guard 4
At Yorktown Celebration

 

Guard of Honor to President
Hoover, Marshal Petain and Gov-
ernor Ritchie, oﬂlcer in the Y rk-
town Sesquicentennial celebra on,
and second lieutenant in the Coast
Artillery——that’s what a vacation
means to E. A. Batchelder, assist-
ant to the registrar. ‘

On his return from the recent
Yorktown celebration Mr. Batch-
elder was enthusiastic over his ad-
ventures. He was stationed at
Yorktown, Virginia, with the Reg-
ular Army and as fortunate in
taking his vacation at the time of
the Sesquicentennial Yorktown
Celebration held last month.

Frosh Cage Aspirants
Practice With Varsity

 

Freshman practice last week
consisted of long and strenuous
scrlmmages against the varsity
with some twenty-five men report-
ing each night.

Thus far Wanio, Cribbs, Brooks,
Kune, Wadsworth, and Wilson
hold the inside track. These men
have shown more than ordinary
ability in drills against the varsity.

Although scrimmages occupy
most of the sessions, fundament-
als are still being taught. The
long and hard sessions are a real
test for the fittest and most ener-
getic candidates.

Coach Zehfuss expects to turn
out an aggregation equal to those
produced by his predecessor
George Kowallis, who turned in a
record of fifty consecutive victor-
ies. He is satisfied with the im-
proved form of the, boys, but still
agrees that there is much room for

improvement. ,

came when he was appointed
among the Honor Guard to the
president of the United States. He
also served as Honor Guard to
Marshal Petain of France, Gov-
ernor Ritchie, of Maryland, and
General Pershing. During the cele-
bration he was an ofﬁcer in the
mythical British Army which re-
enacted the Battle of Green
Springs, and he was also an officer
in the sham Battle of Redoubts,
which decided the Revolutionary
War in favor of the Americans.

Twenty-ﬁve hundred troops, of
all branches of the "service, took
part in the celebration in which
were used guns of the 1781 type.
Mr. Batchelder’s regular Battery
gave an exhibition of searchlight
maneuvres at night in sighting air-
planes, and in keeping sighted
aerial targets at which machine
guns and anti-aircraft guns shot.

Mr. Batchelder is a second lieu-
tenant in the 503 Coast Artillery,
Battery A12, stationed at Fort Mon-
roe. He is also President of the
Scabbard and Blade, honorary mili-
tary science fraternity, at the Uni-
versity.

Rushing Dr. N1'ebuhr’s Address

6‘ WORLD is on the
brink of disaster and
_you college men and women
don’t give a darn.”
Somehow we irresponsible ~

'1‘ 6:00 O’CLOCK tonight,
the silence period for

the men's fraternity rushing
season will end. and approxi-
mately 200 freshmen will be

 

pledged to the various social
fraternities on the campus.

Rushing was different to the

. various fraternities on the

‘ campus than it has -been in the

,recent past with the business
conditions as they are and de-
cneased enrollment calling for
keener competition for the de- -
sired men.

Interfraternity con ii at-
tempted to limit the 7:051: of
rushing by limiting the number
of registered rushing events to
two, one-half the total origin-
ally agreed upon at the close of
the last school: year. ‘

From present reports. how-
ever, this measure flalilledl in its
purpose. Rushing extended
over a longer period this year
than it did last year; and with

fewer events scheduled and
these on practically— the- same‘
nights, more time was neces-
sarily devoted to individual
rushing which resulted in
greater costs to several fratern-
men.

The rushing period showed‘
that the rushing rules new ex-
isting appear inadequate in
places. It is difficult to pro-
hibit oontact between upper-
classmen and freshmaen for
seven weeks after the semes-
ter has started.

Perhaps, the difficulty lies_
mainly with freshmen rather
than fraternity men. Many
members of the former group
are green with regard to the
fraternity system at Pitt and
are easily impressed by so- _
called “big time" adventures
which do not actually result in

, their gaining a, true knowledge
. "of the type of men in the fra-

ternity rushing them.
‘Likewise, there are many
freshmen on the campus who
have decided upon their fra-
ternal affiliations long before
the‘ start of their freshman
year; and their contact with
otherfreshmen enables them to
have ‘inﬂuence upon them up
to the time when silence period
ends. .
Ignterfraternity council holds
its. next meeting on December
1. The results of the present
rushing season will occupy a
large measure of the discus-
sion at that meeting. It will
llklely suggest changes to the
rules, which have undergone
repeated alterations during the
past few years. The December
1 meeting will be awaited with

' interest.

Musical Organizations

ITT’.Si WELL managed
and Well directed musi-
cal organizations are in the
process of achieving a leading
position among student activ-
ities. The University Band,
the Symphony Orchestra, and
the Glee Clubs, are much on
the go. ’

[The orchestra following
weekly rehearsals since Sep-
tember, made its first appear-
ance of the year at last Mon-
day's assembly. Its popularity
was attested by the call for
encores from the large number
of students present.

The Men’s Glee Club opens
its season’ this evening. It
will sing a specially ar-
ranged program at Chancel-
lor Bowman’-3 reception for the

_ parents of freshmen at Me-
ymorial Hall. The women's club
is also quite active, planning
concerts in the Pittsburgh dis-
trict. They will sing at the
Women's Day exercises, De-
cember 4. ’

The University Band is pre-
paring for the Nebraska game
at'the stadium Thanksgiving
day, its final marching appear-
ance of the season, With 120‘
men making trips to South
Bend and State College, the
band had an enjoyable sea-
son. After Thanksgiving a
smaller group will begin prac-
tice for the annual home con-
cert, and future assemblies.
This year the band has been
under the instruction of the
military department, with a
resultant improvement in their
marching ability. This, with
the student co-operation giv-
en, has been a source of sat-
isfaction to the friends of the
band.

collegiates can't get wrought
up over Dr. Niebuhr’s indict-
ment. We’ve been told that so
often that we have gone
through the process which psy-
chologists call sensory adapta-
«tion; we can no longer respond
to “that stimulus.

In the latest issue of a na-
_tional frat1ernity’s magazine

— there is an article in which the

author, in ans or to Eidtna
Ferber"s recen A deprecation
against youth, quotes similar
criticisms which appeared in
publications of bygone genera-
tions.

Even ’way «back in 1863, this

-author points out, youth wasn't

all that it should be. An ar-
ticle in the “Monthly -Review"
of that year probably gave Dr.
Niebuhr the idea for his charge
of lack of fear. “Want- of rev-
erence is one of the common
faults of the young in,ou~r day,"
said this 1863 author. “That
it should accompany gneat self-
assurance is nothing wonder-
ful, though it is not easy to
say which is the cause or the
effect of the other.” From that
time up to the present, this ar-
ticle in the fraternity maga-
zine qu ties numerous refer-

,ences w ich indicate that the

younger generations of their
respective eras were on the
verge of catastrophic.

All of which merely indicates
that these prophets of calam-
ity stumbled into the same err-
or as Dr, Niebuhr, that of judg-

ing the entire younger genlera- ‘

tion by the general run of rah-
.rah men and women. Certain-
ly we have our young men and
women who don't give a hoot
about Germany's predlicamnent

or the Manchurian situation.
We venture to say that when
Dr. Niebuhr was a young ’im
the majority of his companions
lost little sleep over the out-
come of the Russo-Japanese
War. It is out of this group
that we get our one hundred
per cent Americans. But there
is also the group that pierces
the surface, that realizes that
there are grave problems that
will have to be solved. It is
this group that furnishes us our
leaders. There have
been these two classes; and
but for the difference, we would
have all followers or all lead-

ers.
Health Week

T UDENT S WASTE their
energy lavishly while in
college, somlevtimes paying in
later years for the extravagant
drain on health and strength.
Health Week, sponsored by the
VVomen’s Athletic Association,
has served as a reminder of
this fact during the past week.
In cooperation with many
colleges all over the country,
this organization has attempt-
ed to stimulate interest in pre-
serving health. It has pre-

sented to the campus the com- ’

monplace rules of health which
every student knows and every
student neglects.

Going without sleep, eating
irregularly, “keeping alive on
your nerve” are taken for
granted as a. part of college
life. The health departments
for men and women have tried
to show students that preser-
vation of health is as much a
duty as work in the curriculum’.
Now, by means of a campaign,
W. A. A. insists that it can be
a pleasure as Well.

Vifhile the inﬂuence of the
Health Program might be more
wide spread, it is probable that
it will grow as it is observed
year after year. Many who
do not participate directly in
any of the events have uncon-
sciously realized anew the im-
portance of good health to the
college student. Reaching be-
yond its primary interest in
physical development, the as-
sociation will. if it succeeds in
its purpose, advance as well
the quality of scholastic and

activity accomplishment at Pitt..

To Editor of the Pitt Weekly:

Attention of Pitt students
must have been drawn to the
announcement of several west-
ern university co-ed student
bodies that henceforth women
students would pay half the
cost of dates. It is certain that
social activity will be curtailed
this winter. What do the Pitt
co-eds think about the Arizona
University plan? Would Pitt
co-eds foot half the bill? If the
men struck and made no dates
with, co-eds at all, would the
girls be willing to pay?

A good argument in favor of
the girls paying is that if they
did, they would be able to dis-
criminate, going only with fel-
lows for whom they really
cared. It would give the girls
a good excuse for refusing a
date.

There is no real basis be- ‘
sides custom for men paying
and if this custom could be
broken down, it would make
for a more pleasant social sea-
son this winter. It would be

I interesting to get an expres-
sion from the Pitt co-eds on
this subject. I know everyone
would be interested if the
Weekly ran a survey.

that mule, and how he is acting today. Can't
you imagine him hitched to an ice wagon_and

English Debaters Favor
Forensics on Sports Page

Debating stories should be print-
ed on the sports page with sup-
posedly more dangerous forms of
competition, according to Stuart
Craig of Nottingham University
and John Needham of the ‘Univer-
sity of Durham, English debaters
touring this country, for “in Eng-
land it is’ the usual occurrence for
debaters to be heckled, hooted, and
even stormed off the platform by
a barrage of vegetables.‘ ' You
see the students themselves carry
on the debating activities with no
coaches or instructors on the col"-
lege faculty,” said Needham, when
interviewed several days ago.

“Before we left England,” Craig
and Needham both began at once,
“we ,were warned about American
hospitality and we found that
warning to have been justified.”

Needham drawled his reply to a
question on the November 7 debate
in deep-throated Oxfordian, “Pitts-
burgh presented the best case for
charity of any American school.
Mr. Murphy and Mr. Levin did an
excellent job.”

“In what way does American
college life differ from that in
England?” they were asked.

“We think that the outstanding

Recent Books

Dramatic Works, Novels
u Appear Next Week

New books added to the Univer-
sity Library during October center
mainly around literature and the
stage.

“The Best Plays of 1930 and 1931:
And the Year Book of the Drama
in America,” by Burns Mantle, is
the recipient of favorable com-
ments from all critics. “The Cream
of the Jesters” is a volume of the
best American wit and humor from
the pens of Will Rogers, Milt Gross
and other noted humorists.

Other books include the famous
marathon trilogy of Eugene O’Neill
“Mourning Becomes Electra”
“My Father,” a, biography of Mark
Twain by his daughter, Clara Clem-
ens; a biography, “Incredible Car-
negie," written by John K, Wrink-
le; “August," the story of a wan-
dering vagabond by the famous
Norwegian novelist, Knute Hamsuu
and the “International Encyclope-
dia ot Prose and Poetical Quota-
tions," compiled by William S.
Walsh.

“The Black Worker," by S. D.
Spero and A. L. Harris, is a de-
scription of the Negro’s new status
in industry, and R. R. Erang gives
a very distinct contribution. to the
history of ideas in his book, “Her-
der and the Foundations of Ger-
man Nationalism,” a study of pres-
ent day Germany.

These books are being catalogu-
ed and will be ready for use next
week.

 

Botany, Profs Discuss
Heredity and Eugenics

 

Dr. J. L. Cartledge, assistant pro-
fessor of botany, and Dr. P. W‘.
Whiting, associate professor of
zoology, addressed Phi Sigma, hon-
orary scientiﬂc fraternity, in the.
Carnegie Museum Cafeteria last?
week. The subject of their talks‘

concerned genetics and heredity.
Dr. Cartledge, who spends his
summer in the Carnegie lnstitu-l
tion at Cold Springs Harbor study-i
ing the problems of inheritance
concerned with the Datura plant,
spoke about his experiments. Dr.
Whiting spoke about the wasp and

brutal, but I don’t think it is. Cer-

difference of American college
life is the existence of fraternities
and their cliques. In England we
try to avoid divisions. The only or-
ganizations that even slightly cor-
respond to the fraternities are
the Union Societies to which all
students belong.” Craig was ready
to debate the relative merits of
English and American games. ‘He
said, “But don't you think football
is slow? Interest lags. Over in
England we don't make a practice
of sending in reserves when the
team is hard pressed, nor do we
allow time outs.”

Needham also joined in with,
“I had heard that football was
tainly it is no more strenuous
than Rugby.”

“But what of Pitt and Tech ri-
valry,” ,I said. Iwas on the defen-
sive. Needham was quick to agree,
“What sporting gestures! It
seems to me that such rivalry as
that which exists between Pitts-
burgh and Carnegie Institute is

the very cream of university 1ife."

“Trelawney of the ‘Wells’’’ is the
most impossible play that we have
ever seen. It could never have hap-
pened, and only the good light-
wood familiarity of the Tech Little
Theater could‘ have made it 91688-
ant all. But pleasant it was, with its
easy talk, its delightful scenery, its
very adequate casts and their re-
markably fine voices. It wouldn't
be worth the trouble at the Nixon,
but nobody should have missed it

was about when he wrote it is a
thing mystical and not for the com-
mon eye. A theme? There isn't any
theme. Consistency? There isn't a
trace of it. Trelawney herself is a‘.

a lady, now she's an actress; now
she’s the most Sushing girl in the
world, now she's so stilted that she
can scarcely accomplish one ordi-
nary word, and in the last act no-
body knows what she is—if she
happens to be anything at all. Al-
together. it’s a bad play written
well and played in the amateur
manner which is always ardent,
often gifted, and n-ever in the
least offensive. And there will be
better stuff for the Dramaat talents
