 Urges Political Action

by LOIS LEVINSON

A leader in the women's.libera-
tion movement Monday outlined
the process whereby the move-
ment is gaining political clout.

Betty Friedan, one of the heads
of the National Women’s Political
Caucus (NWPC) and author of
The Feminine Mystique, urged
male and female Pitt students to
take part in the "exploding mar-
velous movement of women." She
cited three stages of women’s lib-
eration that have taken place.

According to Friedan, The
FeminineMystique, published in
1963, awakened women’s minds
and gave voice to the “impotent
rage” they suffered. She said she
wrote the book “only to put into
words what lots of women had
been feeling. We had to break
through the feminine mystique in
our own minds so we could look at
ourselves as people in society and
to feel unguilty for wanting what
every other human being is sup-

posed to want.”

She termed the smoldering re-
sentment felt by "every woman
who was supposed to be a house-
wife and do for love what no wom-
an or man would do for pay" the
impetus for the second stage,
where women realized they need-

ed organization and commitment -

to break out of their traditional
role. This, she said, caused the
burgeoning of women’s liberation
groups beginning with NOW (Na-
tional Organization of Women),

/

BETTY FRIEDAN '

which Friedan helped organize in
1966.

The third stage, Ms. Friedan
said, began on the 50th anniver-
sary of women’s suffrage with
the nationwide strike for equality
in which over one‘ million Ameri-
can women took part. Because of
this, stated Friedan, “women de-
cided that we did have the pow-
er to confront and change the in-
stitutions and they realized the
need for political power."

Friedan claimed that male-
dominated power structure has
made small concessions, but that
“even though the House of Repre-
sentatives passed an Equal
Rights Amendment, the Senate
took it and chopped it down to
nothing.”

“All wo.nen are being deprived
of equal protection of the law
when the laws are interpreted and

administered by all male courts .

that go all the way up to the Su-
preme Court," said Friedan.

By 1976, she predicted. there
will be several women candidates
in the presidential race and the
power structure will be shared
more evenly by all.

“Admission standards must be
the same for women and men,”
she said. “There have to be child-
care centers. There has to be
equal access of women to top jobs,
and there has to be a whole new
thinking within the disciplines, re-

garding their approach to wom-I

en.”

She said that if some progress
could be made in Pittsburgh,
"which is hardly a daisy field." it
could be duplicated anywhere.

Ms. Friedan endorsed JoAnn
Gardner in her race here for City
Council. She agr.eed with Gard-
ner’s slogan “Women make poli-
cy, not coffee.”

She also characterized the Uni-

versity as “an institution that has

to change.”

When asked by a man if she
would endorse a woman who was
sexist. she replied, “Of course
not! Would you endorse a man
who was a racist?"

Friedan spoke at noon in Law-
rence Hall.

Many Graduate Schools Accept Letter-Grade

by LEE EILS

Graduate school applicants may
be surprised to learn that the ap-
pearance of pass/fail, satisfac-
tory-unsatisfactory, or credit/no
entry options on their transcripts
will probably not prove damaging.

Admissions officers at the Pitt

. "Law School, the Yale Law School,

the ‘Stanford Medical School,
Washington University's School

I of Graduate‘ Studies, Harvard’s

School of Graduate. Studies, and

l‘ - the University of Miami's School

of Marine and Atmospheric Sci-

‘ ences were questioned about the

appearance of letter-grade alter-
natives on applicants’ transcripts.

: Each admissions officer em-
phasized that verylfew or no cases
had been encountered where the
options dominated an applicant‘s
transcript or where, appearing in-
frequently, the options made the

' ~ admissions decision difficult.

Such" options have "been insti-

.- _ -tuted by many colleges and uni-
‘. .versities'- throughout the country
' as alternatives to letter grades

and as means of facilitating ex-
ploration and experimentation on
the part of the undergraduate. The
graduate admissions officers gen-
erally felt such options may be of
value when used in non-major and
non-cognate courses as a means
of experimentation and explora-
tion. -

Of course. such progressive ed-

. ucational measures may be abus-

ed, and may, in the words of Mrs.
J .. V. McFadden, ‘ admissions offi-
cer in Harvard’s' School of Grad-
uate Studies, "do a disservice to
good students."

In cases where pass/fail, S-U,
or credit/no entry options consti-
tute less than 10 or 15 per cent of
the total transcript, the options
command little or no attention un-
less all appear ', in the major or
minor area (which has never hap-
pened).

Says Professor Clyde Sommers,
chairman of the admissions com-
mittee at the Yale Law School,
“It really amounts to the equiva-
lent of no grade at all.” Professor
Sommers’ ‘sentiments are shared
by Rita McElroy, director of Ad-
missions at the Pitt Law School.
In vieyving a letter grade alterna-
tive, she claims, “We don't know
how to take it; generally, we just
pass ‘right over it.” Much of a law
school's admissions task is now
handled by the Educational Test-
ing Service which administers the
Law School Admission _ Test
(LSAT) and the Law School Data
Assembly Service (LSDAS),
which collects, distributes, and
comments on applicants’ trans-
cripts. Professional schools are
tending to adopt more uniform
admissions procedures to insure
fairness.

In cases where letter-grade al-
ternatives constitute a majority
on the applicants transcripts. ad-
missions officers contacted could
only hypothesize as they have not
yet encountered applications
where the options predominate.

Ralph E. Morrow. dean of
Washington Universitys School
of Graduate Studies, reflected a
common opinion: “We tend to
place emphasis on four major
bodies of evidence: the transcript.
letters of recommendation. grad-

uate entrance examinations, and
samples of undergraduate work.
When one or more of these bodies
of evidence does not provide
meaningful information, we are
less able to evaluate fairly and the
other bodies of evidence receive
more attention than might other-
wise be the case.

Asked whether or not they view- I

ed the institution of letter-grade
alternatives as a healthy trend,
the? admissions officers qualified
their affirmative answers. Said
Dr. Robert J. Hurley of the Uni-
versity of Miami School of Ma-
rine and Atmospheric Sciences;
“To the extent that a college edu-
cation is a learning experience af-
fording‘the student an opportun-
ity to do some sampling, it is a
good and possibly great idea. As
far as insuring a firm command of
a particular discipline’s basic
skills is concerned, it's not such a
hot idea.”

Marcia J. Taylor of the Stan-
ford Medical School, seemed most
representative in her overall ap-
praisal of letter-grade alterna-
tives. We see the pass/fail option
as offering new latitudes for the
students and the development of
undergraduate programs. How-
ever, in those instances in which
a student must or does take a ma-
jority of his courses on a pass/
fail basis. it is absolutely manda-
tory that the Admissions Com-
mittee receive very detailed in-
formation regarding his instruc-
tor‘s perception of his ability to
do course work in order that he
receive a fair hearing.

ed purpose—that_of facilitating

Constitutional Review    

by JOYCE GEMPERLEIN -

The Student Association Con-
stitution slated for review is ap-
parently a victim of procrastina-
tion.

Members of the sub-commit-
tee chosen to ‘review the docu-
ment have not yetmet to discuss
the issue.

At a meeting of the Commis-
sioners in September, it was de-
cided that the Constitution should
be either restructured or re-writ-
ten to provide for ethical, work-
able guidelines for student gov-
ernment. Nov. 16 was the date set
for a possible student referendum
on constitutional reforms. On Oct.
6, Social Commissioner Lenny
Klavonic announced the names of
those chosen to serve on the com-
mittee.

There is confusion among the
members of the sub-committee
as to who is chairman or why
there have been no meetings‘ to re-
view the Constitution.

Mar'y Huber, a committee mem-
ber, said, “I declined the chair-
manship mainly because I was on
one of those committees last year
and it was a disaster. No one has
told me of any meetings—I am to-
tally uninformed. Also, there
should be an underclassman on
the subcommittee so that some.»
one still here will be accountable
for any action taken.” .

Harris Miller, also a commit-
tee member, said that to his know-

Contrary to popular belief,
Franklin Pangborn is not “just

‘ter of fact, he never even went to
the University, yet the campus
film club has used his name for its
title, the Franklin Pangborn Film
Club. '

\ So who is Franklin Pangborn?

A representative of the club,
production and equip .nent direc-
tor Steve Savage would rather not
say. “I couldn’t explain the mat-
_ ter in a few sentences,” he stated.

Instead Savage explained the
activities of the lately-controver-
sial club, and how its functions af-

fect the student body.

“We have three main objec-
tives,” he began, “to provide the
I University with a fine compre-
‘ hensive film program; to get peo-
ple interested in making films and
giving them the opportunity and
experience to do so; and to pro-
vide the University ‘with a news-
reel-type system of communica-
tion to be shown twice a month.”

 

-Elaborating on the newsreel,
Savage pointed out that the ex-
pected length of the “short” would
be about 15 minutes and that the
first newsreel might be out by

 ‘December. “We feel that since
5'" 4 Pitt is a large University, more
 if than one or two forms of campus
 communication should be utilized
 ‘ to reach the students,” said Sav-
' P age about the newsreel.

Forastudent interested in shooting

a film, the whole learning process

~ involved is fairly short and easy.
Savage described the process:
“We start them off with a Super-8 '
camera which is “a simplified mo-
vie camera, to get experience.

SAVAGE: Fim depatment needed.

The next step involves going out
with a more experienced film club
member to carry lights and gen-
erally observe the proceedings.
As the person learns more and
more about the aspects of film
making, within a month that per-
son could be shooting 16 milime-
ter film.”

Pangborn‘s latest project, a 30
minute documentary on the stu-
dents’ relations to the Oakland
community, is,,Savage said, a stu-
dent-based attempt to deal with

V issues such as landlord problems,

street safety, and Pitt‘s expan-
sion.

The main purpose of the film,

aside from giving f'ilm-making ex-
perience, is that it will be made
f'or showing on television in or-
der to orient more than just stu-
dents to the problems of off-cam-
pus housing. Savage estimated
that if the film was aired at ama-
jor city television station it could
reach as many as a million peo-
ple. He hinted that preliminary
contacts have been made but could
not be specific.

Savage pointed out another uni-
que fact of the project, namely
that Franklin Pangborn was com-
bining forces with other campus

groups to make the film. “For in-
stance,” he began, “we have peo-
ple from two film courses; cam-
eras from the medical schools
and their advisors as well as our
own; sound men from WPGH and
the Audio-Visual Services; and re-
search help from the Off-Campus
Housing Office and the Tenants
Union.”

The budget for the documen-
tary was estimated at $4.500.
which Savage said was “bone-
cheap" for a black and white film.
"As of now." he-speculated. "the
film will be budgeted by the club.
but if an outside sponsor, such as
TV station gets interested. we
could get paid back.

Turning to a more sour note.
Savage lamented the absence of a
film department at Pitt. "We
should have instead of a film club,
a film department to afford the
expense of film making. There is
certainly enough‘ interest here to
start such a department.“ ""‘

In case any students might have
any complaints about off campus
housing or would like to partici-
pate in making the film, Savage
recommended contacting Dave
Saz or himself, at either 513 SU
or 683-5562. '

  Feminine  Mystiqiie  

°Too Tight A Girdle’

by POHLA SMITH
News Editor

For Betty Friedan, noted fem-
inist and author of The Feminine
Mystique, being liberated is like
coming out of “too-tight a girdle."

“I‘m finding myself and more
and more of the freedom to be my-
self.“ Ms. Friedan said in an in-
terview. commenting on the ef-
fects of the feminist movement on
her personal life.

Since Ms. Friedan became lib-
erated from what she calls the
feminine mystique—a myth which
she says teaches woman’s only
purpose is to be a wife and mother
‘—she finds life holds more prom-
A ise for her.

She has been considered one of
the leaders of the current femin-
ist movement since she first ad-
vised women in The Feminine
Mystique to seek personal satis-
faction outside. the home.

_ She had devoted the years since
the publication of her book to de-
veloping a new consciousness and
a revolt to the feminine mystique
of Anerican society.

The road of her campaign was
not smooth. Ms. Friedan said she
has been ridiculed and heckled in

many of the same ways as were
the early suffragettes who were
often termed man-eaters suffer-
ing from penis envy.

For instance, Monday Ms.
Friedan had a guest appearance
on KDKA’s Contact Show. To an-
nounce her appearance the station
flashed a caricature on the
screen; it showed her in a defiant
posture, baring her teeth—like a
“monster” or a “harpie” as Ms.
Friedan described it,

But in her own words, Ms. Fried-
is “not as thin-skinned" as she
once was. She noted that even
mates‘ attitudes are changing.

"Men really dig this (the fem-P

inist movement)” she said,
“they‘re seeing their own libera-
tion entailed too.”

The problem now, in Ms. Fried-
an’s opinion, is getting women to
act according to their convictions.
Women, she says, feel threatened
at, having to change their life
styles; therefore, they hesitate.

But the fear and hesitation of
putting their convictions into ac-
tion is understandable to Ms.
Friedan.

“I must say it was easier for
me to break with the myth intel-
lectually than to change _my way
of life,” she admitted.

According to Ms. Friedan, the
next phase of ‘feminist activity is

changing society through political V

action. ‘This summer she and
other leading feminists founded
the National Women's Political
Caucus which will seek to have
women represented as nominat-
ing convention delegates and as
political office holders.

-Ms. Friedan is optimistic that
this phase will be as successful as
the phase to spread consciousness
of the feminist movement. ’

”by 1972 women will be involv-
ed in many races for state sen-

ates and legislatures, and by 1976 ‘

there will be-more than one seri-

ous woman candidate for. Presi- :-
dent." -

At Arms Control Parley

Skeptics Probe SALT

by BILL GORMLEY
Editor
PHILADELPHIA — The Stra-
tegic Ar.ns Limitation Talks
(SALT) between the U.S. and
the Soviet Union may represent
a milestone. but prominent arms

specialists believe there are
many more miles ahead.
Defense analysts peppered

their references to SALT with
pessimism, at the Fifth Interna-

tional Arms Control Symposium, -

which ended Sunday.

“The SALT talks are perhaps
the most important negotiations
ever undertaken by men,” Walt
Rostow said in a keynote ad-
dress. ‘

But symposium participants
predicted a SALT accord that
would be somewhat beneficial
at best. Several argued that neg-
ative fallout from SALT may
outweigh SALT’S benesfits.And a
few cast aspersions on the So-
viet Union’s motives at SALT.

EUPHORIA FEARED

Dr. Robert Bowie of Harvard
argued that the recent Soviet
buildup in land-based Inter-con-
tinental Ballistic Missiles (IC-
BMs) may represent an attempt
to improve the U.S.SIR.’s bar-
gaining posture at SALT. Bowie
also contended that SALT might
have unfortunate _effects on U.S.
opinion, noting» the “tendency
of our democratic process to cul-
tivate euphoria.” I

Dr. Wynfred Joshua of the
Stanford Research Institute am-
plified that theme, arguing that
SALT success might induce “do-
mestic euphoria” _in the U.S.,
making it difficult to get de-
fense appropriations bills through
the Congress.

Joshua also said SALT may
encourage Israel to develop a nu-'
clear force, if U.S.-Soviet cooper-
ation weakens Israel’s confidence
that the U.S. would aid Israel,
in case of a Soviet attack.- “SALT
does not offer happy prospects
for the ‘American position posi-
tion, in the Middle East,” J0-
shua argued.

Dr. Ian Smart of the Interna-
tional Institute for Strategic Stu-
dies viewed SALT’s impact on
Europe with similar pessimism.
Smart said a SALT accord may

.reinforce European skepticism

toward the credability of the
American nuclear umbrella (U.S.

- protection). He also noted that a

SALT agreement “freezing or
prohibiting ABM systems de-
signed to protect cities” would
reduce the cost to Europe of de-
veloping an offensive capability
againstthe Soviet Union. Pre-
sumably, that would make-Eur-
opean nations more likely to

1 develop such a capability.

\.

NONPROLIFE RATION

On the brighter side, Dr.
George Quester "of Cornell ar-
gued that “the net impact of
SALT is likely to be helpful
to the Nonproliferation Treaty."

Quester noted that Israel is
tempted to develop a nuclear ca-
pacity “to intimidate Arab neigh-
bors” and that India is tempted to

do the same out of “a general
desire for prestige.”

He argued, however, that "a
super-power SALT agreement
which reduced the legitimacy of

nuclear weaponry would reduce ’

Indianland Israeli incentives for
the bomb.”

Rostow, who served as Special
Assistant for National Security
under President Johnson, observ-
ed that the U.S. "entered SALT,
in part, to prevent other nations
from obtaining arms.”

In a speech- that alarmed some
participants, Takeshi Muramat-
su of Tokyo suggested that Japan
too might soon join the nuclear
club. -

Reiterating Japan’s insistence
on China’s signing the Nonprolif-
eration Treaty as a precondition
to Japan’s signing it, /Murama-
tsu said it will be increasingly

difficult “to convince the Jap-
anese that the United States will,
without fail, protect Japan from
a challenge from China. "

According to Muramatsu, Pre-
sident Nixon‘s decision to visit

China and his failure to notify‘

Premier Sato in advance of that
decision have “spread anxiety
across Japan.” -

The conference, which attract-
ed representatives from the
RAND Corporation, the Fletch-
er School of Law and Diplomacy,
Massachusetts Institute of Tech-
nology, and other institutions,
did not appear to include a cross-
section of thinkers in the field.

Dr. Jerome Laulicht of the So-
ciology~ Department expressed
dismay at the “hardening of the
intellectual arteries” he found.
Laulichtwas appalled by think-
ing he considered Characteristic
of the late ‘50‘s and early ’60’s.

Bangla desh Slaughter

A Potential Vietnam

-4 by JOYCE GEMPERLEIN

In the opinion of the Bangla-
desh League of America, the
slaughter in Pakistan is creating
a potential Vietnam. In Pitts-
burgh, the Friends of Bangla-
desh are initiating action to alter
the United States’ position on the
situation. « -

In literature circulated by the
Bangla desh League, the concern
over Bangla desh(East Pakistan)
is depicted’ as arising from the
mass murders of citizens by the
army of West Pakistan. Robert
Norman, Associate Professor of
Urban Affairs, said that it is es-
timated that “30,000 people of
East Pakistan are slaughtered
daily and that 200,000 children
will eventually die.” ’

The Bangla deshliterature lays
much of the blame for the situ-
ation on the United States’ con-

 After reading the article “Man-

(Pitt News, October 15, 1971), I
feel it is necessary to represent
the students viewpoint to this
this situation.

First, Mr. Vrana stated that if
,the_‘mandatory food plans were
.withdrawn, the cost of housing
would rise. I fail to see the sig-
nificance between the food serv-
ices and the living expenses, and
fMr.'Vrana did not substantiate
..any reasoning for any increase.

’ .He also made reference to the
other schools that experimented
with optional foods plans. In
‘his reference he never mentioned
"which schools his office examin-
--ted, because it is evident that
{certain schools have different sit-
jnéuations. ’

"Women's Studies is not a passing fad that can be shrugged aside.

"Rather, it is a serious attempt to understand the ways in which
women have been molded through art. stifled through economics.
xploited politically, and tormented psychologically. « »
Because sexism is pervasive, Women’s Studies should be all-en-
«ompassing. It must utilize a multidisciplinary approach to learning.

 On Saturday, the Faculty of Artsiand Sciences will consider a
Women’s Studies proposal that recognizes the critical need for a
multidisciplinary Women’s Studies Program. '

if-’o,',l‘he Faculty of Arts and Sciences Council has already endorsed
‘_he_ establishment of a Woman’s Studiesprogram. Saturday s debate
will revolve around the specific form of the program.

The Advisory Council on Women's Opportunities (ACWO).
whose proposal will be considered, believes the Women's Studies
program cannotbe modeled on any existing program at the Univer-

 The ACWO has suggested hiring a “core faculty” of five femin-
ists, who would devote at least two-third of their time to the Wom-
en’s Studies program. Departments would be ‘encouraged to permit
interested faculty to participate in Women’s Studies.

The recruitment of the five feminists would be supervised by a '
{frelevant group” appointed by Chancellor Posvar in consultation with
Dean Jerome Rosenberg of the FAS. Funds would be made availa-
ble-to departments which proposed candidates acceptable to the su-
pervisory group and the department.

 ' At least one faculty member, Dr. Irwin Schulman of the Poli-
tical Science Department, has reservations about the ACWO propos-

Schulman favors a Women’s Studies program, but contends that
the ACWO proposal is an attempt to create a department through the
back door. The ACWO proposal, Schulman argues, grants Women’s
Studies too much autonomy. Women’s Studies, he contends, should
be accountable to departments, which will insist on quality.

Schulman believes Women’s Studies should be treated like any

._ He also believes that the ACWO proposal. which is likely to cost
at._lease $100,000 per year, is unrealistic. given the University‘s’cur-

._ Dr. _Schulman’s concern for academic excellence is laudable.
However, departmental leverage over the Women’s Studies program
could’ be misused; departmental decisions might reflect ideology as

;black people through the Black Studies Department.

 It is imperative that the University display a similar commit-
wment to Women's Studies, brushing aside structural and financial

complaints that deny the uniqueness and importance of a Women‘s

 

uation does not exist. ’

Within a radius of five blocks
there are enough dining spots for
every Pitt student including the
commuters. B

Another plus that Mr. Vrana
mentioned about our system is
the price. True, this would prove
economical if a student attends
all meals. There is no mention of
the percentage of students that
ear breakfast. I can't speak for
a majority but I know a.large
percentage of students. including
myself,.— who have not been to
breakfast once since September.

The nursing students now en-
joy a choice of meal plans which
range from sixteen to twenty-one
meals per week. If the manda-
tory system cannot be eliminat-
ed, why can’t all students enjoy

‘ the same privileges, and be free‘

to choose which meals we would
like to attend?

 O’Brien: °It’s Time for

Us Peasants to Revolt’

(Editor's Note: This is the third

I and last in a series by Pat O'Brien.

Beginning on Monday, Social Com-.

missioner Lenny Klavonic will be- .
gin a three-part series in response -

to O'Brien and on Pitt's entertain-
ment in general.)
by PAT O’B'RIEN
‘ President, Franklin-Pangborn
Film Club

In Part I we recorded how much
Social Commissioner Lenny Kla-
vonic was spending ($71.746 in his
own budget and $14,500 from other
groups), how he was spending it
($63,794 in concert deficits—one
correction. the extra $1,500 loss
on the BST debacle will be cover-
ed notby an additional subsidv.
but by spending $1,500 less On
Homecoming favors). and how he
got that much to spend in the first
place. ,

In Part II we explored the avail-
ability of entertainment in the
Pittsburgh area,’ and concluded
that additional attractions were
unnecessary. ’

Since the appearance of those
articles, people have approached
me, and, while not exactly doubt-
ing my veracity, have expressed
incredulity that such things could

' actually be happening.

“If they are losing as much as
you say,” they ask, “then why
aren‘t the University administra-
tors doing something about it?
Shouldn't they be stopping it?“

As. one member of the Student
Affairs staff constantly reminds
me, “Look, it’s your Student As-
sociation, not mine, pal." Unfor-
tunately, under the present ‘cir-
cumstances. this is only too true:

almost entirely to the discretion
of students, who design the me-

If students prefer concerts and

car clubs to teaching projects,
that is a student choice which

the University will support.
whether it agrees with the choice
or-not. The University intervenes
only, as itdid last summer, when
there is a complete collapse of
integrity. We can, therefore. do
with our money pretty much what
we please. '

Such a situation has turned out
to be a precarious house of cards
and the joker in the deck has al-
ready appeared. His name is Har-
old C. Sylvester, and he is a coun-
ty judge in Vermont. Some stu-
dents at the University of Ver-
mont filed suit in his court against

their school. objecting to the man-' because, Odd as it may Seem’ I

ner in which their fellow students
used the money collected as the
mandatory $21.50 per year stu-
dent activities fee.

These protesting students were

angered because their money _fi--

nanced the campus appearances
of Leonard Weinglass, Edward
Joseph, Herbert Aptheker, and
Dick Gregory. Judge Sylvester
agreed. “Few,” he said, “would
seriously contend these four par-

ticular speakers contributed any- -

thing to ‘the university campus
that could‘ be termed cultural, ed-
ucational, or recreational.”

The plaintiffs were also unhap-
py with the student newspaper. So
was Judge Sylvester. It has, he
decided, “consistently published
editorials of a radical persua-
sion” and, in general, pursued a
course of "blatant abuse of its

- rights as a free press.”

Judge Sylvester went further.
He ruled-that “expenditure and

appropriation of the student asso- -

ciation ‘fees may not be made

by ELLEN GANLEY
Night Editor

When I was a senior in high
school, my class began to receive
a supplemental study of black

history along with the tradi-
tional text in white American
history.

We all thought, in our naive
way, that this was a great addi-
tion to our history class and felt

"that our education was becom-

ing extremely liberal.

But one day, someone asked
our typical, white-female-dowag-
er-history-teacher why women
were never mentioned in our
texts. She came up with the ans-
.wer,, “Well, you know the old
saying . . . ‘there's always a wo-
man behind every great man in
history.‘ “

The tragic point of this whole
incident is that many people in
my class, both male _and female,

accepted this answer without even .

sociation?

I doubt that they could defend
$63,794 in concert deficits, on
grounds other than the decision to
spend such a sum was made by
the students themselves, grounds
that Judge Sylvester does not rec-
ognize.

Despite the present use being
made of so much activities fee
money, I support the Universitys
collection of the fee and the al-
most entirely free rein Pitt stu-
dents enjoy in spending it.

I would hope that some sensible
judge will overrule Mr. Sylvester

would rather see the Student As-
sociation squandering funds on
its own initiative than spending
them “properly" under direct
University guidance, in which
case the assessment would be a
"University" activities fee.

.My preference, however, is the
present system, but with more re-
sponsible students in command
of the Student Association.

Guaranteeing a proper alloca-
tion of student funds is only one-
function of a student government
or association. Such a body must
also minimize the effect on stu-
dents of arbitrary decisions made
by university administrators and
spur the various deans toward
academic reform. Whatever else
it does is just so much extra but
these three areas are vital.

FAS can promote social reform

‘through women’s studies

The correct answer is that wo-

men have been denied their his-

tory for hundreds of years. It has
only been within the past five or
six that women have stood up and
demanded recognition of their
history, their literature, and ev-
erything else they have given,

unnoticed, to society.

The University of Pittsbur'gh‘s
Faculty‘of Arts and Sciences
(FAS) has the power to give
Pitt women the opportunity to
learn about their history, litera-

ture, psychology. _and place in _

today's society. The Women's
Studies Proposal comes before
the FAS at their meeting on Oct.
23 for approval. or, if worse
comes to worse, disapproval.

The Women's Studies Propos-
al is very basic. It was originally
drawn up by_the Advisory Coun-
cil on Women's Opportunities and
calls for the formation of a Wo-
men‘s ‘Studies Program and the.

hiring of five"women__,to teach 1
 women‘;-s:cours'es..w   

    

There are many factors point-
ing to the need for Women’s
Studies at Pitt. Besides the av-
erage woman’s general lack of

knowledge about her past and

present, there is also the fact that
the few Women’s Studies cours-
es that have been offered at the

University have been full by
the time registration is complet-
ed. This is no small feat when
one considers that each course
is open to between 30 and 120
students.

Another point to consider is
that Pitt is not an all male in-
stitution, just as it is not an all-
white institution. When Black,
Studies courses were requested.
they were granted. Blacks were
giventhe chance to discover their
previously-invisible heritage. Why
not give women the same ‘chance?

Yes. the FAS has the power in
its hands.‘ Is the faculty of Pitt
going" to prove itself to be as pro-
gressive as we like to think it is,

’,Switch}:ioard Connects
a Person To Person ,

by DENNIS KLEPPICK

, .- Switchboard, according to vol-
unteer operator Mike'Walton, “is
.a ‘community telephone service
for the-people. We are basically a
‘_source"of information on nearly
any! subject that will meet the
needs of the people.“

  Switchboard has been providing
iﬁthis service for a year, handling
I over 20,000 calls on such diverse
 -topics as legal aid, planned par-
, enthood, drug problems and pad-
; w fcrashing.

“Even if you just want to rap,

'we’ll be glad to listen," stated

Walton.

 . “We’re here as an alternative
. to‘ the ‘so-called ‘Establishment

Institutions.’ We’re trying to pull
people together, primarily the

-,1 young and oppressed. We’re try-
. ing tohelp.”

-Switchboard in Pittsburgh is
connected with other Switch-
boards across the country in such
cities as Chicago. San Francisco,

 New York, and Boston.

‘»‘This nationwide system," stat-

; I. -ed Walton, "enables us to contact
-7 —r’..~p'arents of runaways who want to.
" go home, to find a pad for some-

one hitching across country, or to
relay news about local happen-
ings." A

Switchboard maintains a
“‘What’s Happening Board’ of
things going on around town like
concerts, rallies, recycling pro-
jects, almost everything.”

To provide these services, the
organization‘ is staffed by volun-
teers and funded by donations
from people and businesses.

“Most of the staff, headed by

‘ Bob Nelson and Peggy Galley. are

under 25. We have high school and
college students. street people
and business people like Nelson

' and Galley," said Walton.

“So you could say that we have
a wide range of experience to han-
dle any problems that come up,”
he added.

Switchboard operates from 9
a.m. to 2 a.m. Sunday through
Thursday, and around the clock on
Friday and Saturday.

Walton stated that the opera-
tors were "organized into four
shifts with never less than two
people per shift."

. Switchboard’s number is 682-
5200.

America More Beautiful

Europe Changes Youths

by JUDY DECKER

The varied. exciting and funny
experiences of 10 foreign study
scholarship recipients were dis-
cussed in a formal debriefing ses-
sion held by the Nationality
Rooms Co nmittee last week.

The ten students had traveled
and lived in many different coun-
tries, through the langesse of the
committee. ’

The most common experience
among the travelers was a change
in perception as an American.
Carl Van Horn commented that he
defended America vigorously
while in Scotland—something he
does not normally do in the U.S.

The experience gave him a new

perspective of the U.S. Karen,
Woodall's travels changed her too._

in that she no longer "runs after"

things as Americans tend to do.
but appreciates the present. con-
sidering it as important as the fu-
ture. ' I A ' A
Janice Haupt felt that she also
gained a true appreciation of peo-
ple, through her stay in Italy. And,
through a taste of Irish life,‘ Moni-

* ca Beary felt that shehad a great-

er faith in humans. Mike Saloman
summed up almost everyone’s re-
action to living in Europe in say-

ing, ‘‘I didn’t need my car, TV or .

stereo. I didn’t have to spend a lot
of moneygyet I was happier there
than here.” ' ‘

Asked whether study abroad in-
hibited experiencing European
life, all the students replied that
the study locus was necessary.

and that it allowed them to have '

many wonderful experiences that
would have_ been missed other-

wise. Barb Brannon said that’

nine-tenths of her time was really
study. for she toured museums
constantly. studying 19th century
art in Denmark and Norway. She
added that she found great hos-
pitality and received many spe-
cial privileges. summing up her
study focus as an invaluable re-
search experience.

Bev Marshall also spent much
time in study over one year. She
had the unique experience of trav-
eling as she studied, often seeing
her subject as she learned about
Greek civilization. ' '

Saloman and Van Horn received
much of their knowledge through
conversations with people. Salo-
man, who studied military strat-
egy, was able to “track down”
seven internationally famous peo-
ple in military strategy and dis-
cover their views.

‘Van Horn also talked to people.
about 150 altogether, finding infor-
mation about Catholic and Pro-
testant relations. He interviewed
approximately 40 people who
were well known for this subject,
and felt that he really found out
their attitudes. . ‘ A

Surprisingly enough, none of
the students encountered anti-
Americanism, though most of the
students , were
Americans by the Europeans. Ms.‘
Haupt said she was often spotted
in Italy as American because of
her red knee socks and red shoes.
Salomanpointed out that in Paris,
the French easily recognize

Americans, but.that other Amer-,,
icans couldn’t ‘always identify-

their. fellow countrymen.

I All of the students were:va,mazed-
-at the ‘Europeans’ .interest in

America. Ms. Beary stated that

recognized as

she received the same three po-
litical questions from almost ev-
eryone she met, being asked,
“What do you think of Nixon, the
war, and the economy?” A com-
posite feeling of the students was
that the Europeans are very po-
litical-minded, and extremely
aware of international events,
very much more than Americans-.

If given a chance, a few of the

‘students believed they would have
' done things differently. Amy Kar-

pinski decided she would have
handled oneexperience in a differ-
ent nanner: her dorm chefs ask-
ed her if she had ever tried a na-
tional dish of Spain, a rather cold,
greasy vegetable soup. Since she
hadn‘t, the chef brought her a big
bowl. Though she really didn‘t
like the ‘taste, she praised the
dish, so as to not hurt her chef's
feelings. Because of her praise,
she was served a bowl of this soup

by the chef personally for the next V

six weeks. And, much to her dis-

may, the chef stood over her and

watched her eat it ‘till it was
gone!

Each of the ten students were

impressed with the people he met, ’

visited, and stayed with. Van
Horn was impressed with the op-

Dan Hicks, °Licks’

 Bring Jiigliand Kicks

by WILLIAM M. SMITH
"Bo Dee Oh Do!"

These are the words of a ques-
tion posed by a man who lives
in a world filled with kazoos. gut
buckets, washboards. jugs, fid-
dles, guitars, combs, and tissue
paper. The man is Jim Kweskin,
one of a dying breed of jug-
band spokesmen and a propon-
ent of happiness in music.

Since the dissolution of Jim
Kweskin and the Jug Band, odd-
ly, or perhaps understandably
enough, their last live appear-

ance was right here in Pitts-

burgh (Carnegie Music Hall
1968), there has been no one to
pick/up the groove kazoo and
carry on in the happy, carefree,
jugband tradition. Until now,
thatis!

Take heart all ye lovers of
bouncing balls across silver
Screens, finger-in-the-sky truck-
in’, and white-gloved cartoon
characters, a new champion has
appeared on the long forlorn
musical scene and with him
come dancing, humming, and

, best of all,~long-awaited smiles.

He is ba1lsy~_ but beautiful,

hoarse A but{ heavenly, and this

name is Dan Hicks!

He writes these songs, see, and
plays them accompanied by a
group of two females named
Maryann Price and Naomi Ruth
Eisenberg (more affectionately
called the Lickettes . . .lwhew!),
whose vocal harmonics aptly, cap-
ture the fine 40’s quality of those
legendary Andrews Sisters, and
two other guys, Sid Paige and
Jamie Leopold. who play an ab-

surdly delightful array of instru-
ments.

The complete group is‘ called
Dan Hicks and His Hot Licks,
and their new album on Blue
Thumb records is entitled,
Where's The Money. To the
more “turned-on” audience, let’s
say that listening to this record
is like reading musical Zap Com-
ix.

Dan and the Gang played on
California Street corners for a
pass-the-hat salary and had an
earlier album released on Epic
(1969) which I suppose caught
the listening public in a non-
smiling mood. Anyway, it went
unnoticed. '

But undaunted. they have re-
turned with an album that does
nothing more than make you feel
good. As if that_.isn’t a monu-
mental achievement in itself.

I think everyone still wants
to smile. How’ can we regain
that forgotten, obsolete talent?
Dan himself seems to have the
answer when he says, “Give
your mind a rest, listen’ to my
music.” '

Oh yes, that’s not all. Re-

member that" Kweskin question? _

Well, after all these years my
curiosity has finally been sat-
isfied by who else but Dan
Hicks. The answer, “ba doop
dwee data dwiddle.”

Thanks, Dan, for. the answer
and the smiles.

Matthau Feisty, Lemmon Uneven

, “Kotch” Catches Life    C

by EVAN PATTAK
Associate Editor .

Walter Matthau is Kotch. a
delightfully feisty old man who.
to the chagrin of his son and
daughter-in-law, will not go gen-
tle into that good night.

Though Kotch chatters incom-
prehensibly on and on. the
younger couple tolerates him.
because, after all he is getting
on in years, and besides, any-
thing is permissible in Californ-
ia. ,

Non sequitur by non sequitur.
though, their patience is tested.
When the old gent begins feed-
ing their son late-night snacks
of pizza and. beer, it snaps.
Kotch is banished from their
house.

What next for the dithering
old man-Sunset acres to enjoy
those wonderful, golden years?
Not for this golden ager. Kotch
flees and lives on the road.- The
sweetest of his many sweet acts
is‘ befriending -a knocked-up
young woman who‘ is also knock-
ing about.

The girl (Deborah Winters)

about to give life and the man

who will not give it up make

an odder couple than did iMat-

thau and Jack Lemmon..who by .

the way directs Kotch.

As the spry septuagenerian.
Matthau is superb. The make-
up artists cannot quite transform
Matthau into a geriatric refugee-
with rimless glasses. baggy
pants.’ and slow.Alingering smile.
he reminded me of an expensive
LBJ. Vietnam and Hubert Hum-
phrey long-since forgotten. show-
ing his scar to a baffled but rapt
audience.

But Matthau’s old codger
needs no props. With an imper-
ial ‘strut and an unflappable self-
confidence, Kotch travels Cali-
fornia’s dusty roads doing good.

Director Lemmon exploits
Matthau‘s considerable talent-to
the fullest. Lemmon’s touch over-

. all, however, is uneven.‘

At times, _Lemmon displays
needless sympathy for Kotch‘s
advanced years. During one of
thesesaccharine scenes, as the
camera panned the old age farm.
I could hear breath being sucked

‘in all around me like a giant va-

cuum cleaner. "Oh my God.
They’re taking him to the
Home!" ’

, 197i—'rH‘E PITT 

'voking- you know, driving the"

Then again, Lemmon‘ tries it'o.i.:
capture Kotch’s gusto with things .,
supposedly terribly guffaw-pro,-_

wrong way down alone-way?
street, assemblinga crib. A A

Some critics have already hail- -
ed Kotch the ‘comedy hit of the
year. an unearned occolade.‘~-A
Kotch lacks a foil, someone to i
refine and define his indiscrim-A
inate goodness. Deborah Win- -,
ters does neither, the roles of:
Felicia Farr and Charles Aid-
man. as Kotchs' evictors are
brief not particularly significant." — ‘-7

The ‘climax, in which Kotch» 
manages to affirm life in a liter— V
al as well as a figurative sense-. I
is also maudlin and contrived. g
Fortunately, Kotch the character

(as opposed to Kotch the fi1m).U 

transcends such stagey effects to s
affirm life. ' . '

He is life. It glimmers inhis“

eyes and blossoms in his slow;-it
lingering smile. '

  Rookie 
 Roulette 

With the graduation of CharleyHall, Bryant Salter and
J.D. Lewis last spring, defensive backfield coach Ralph Jelic
knew he had a mammoth rebuilding job as spring drills open
in March. After five games of ' the 1971 season the job is

still far from completed.

“I got to camp in the fall with only one starter return-
ing,” Jelic began, referring to Junior Reggie Frye. “And
even Frye had to learn a whole new defense. Last year Pitt
played a man-to-man, but we’ve gotten away from the pro-
type defense and gone to a zone and variations on the zone.”

ﬁe.

Jelic started to mold his unit with a corps of green sopho-

~ mores and some untested veterans. Frye was the only letter-

man with any experience at-defensive half_back and when’

senior Mike Bannen opted out of the football program
moreunforseen problems arose. With a little juggling, Jelic

came up with a combination.

/

Starting Junior .Joe‘Herndon, senior Lloyd Rogers, sopho-
more Lance Wall, and Frye against the Bruins, the unit turn-
ed in a strong enough performance to brace the defensive con-

tingent. Giving up 164 yards and

ary held their own.

« ‘But by the time Oklahoma storm- .
ed into Pittsburgh and ever since,the .
alignment has rotated like a roulette -
compounded, with f
sophomore mistakes has forced Jelic ~
to shift his players continuously. T
Right now the lineup consists of Lou 3
Cecconi, Dan Rullo, and Ed Marstel- ‘_
lar, all sophomores, with Frye hang— '

“We are an inexperienced team and we’re making our.

The Pitt Soccer team will be
trying to up their record today
against the ‘Big Indians‘ of In-
diana University of Pennsylvan-
ia at Miller field in Indiana.

According to IU soccer coach
Vidvuds Celtnieks. “We're more
or less going to do the best
we can. »

*-The best might not be good
enough because of some key in-
juries tothe Indians squad.

Frank Schactko, an" inside
forward, is hurt and in Celt-
nieks’ opinion “there is a good
chance he won’t see any ac-
tion.”

Schactko is the scoring punch
for the Indians, scoring seven
out of the team‘s seventeen
goals. ’

In last Saturday's loss‘ to
Carnegie Mellon University
two more IU players
injured, fullback Frank Pfief-
fer and sophomore halfback

Denny Charlton.

“We're going to be _hurting
because.we don't have too much

. depth." the IU coach conti-nued.

But he seems to have enough
depth in’ the team to establish
a4-2 record. '

The. forward line of
"Buff" Jack, Arnie Garnikow,
Bruce Chaleff and Tom Nor-
man have been doing the job

1-9-
O

When Pitt, Penn State and West Virginia fans gather
discuss the relative merits of their school football teams, Pan-
ther boosters can always rely on Pitt’s schedule for some-
thing to brag about.

This week’s Panther foe, Boston College, is a prime ex-
ample of the roughness of the schedule. Comparatively
speaking, BC is not one of the powerhouses on the list of
Pitt opponents, yet they compiled an 8-2 record last year
(including a 21-6 win at the Cat’s expense) and presently
maintain a respectable 4-2 mark.

Panther Coach Carl DePasqua flatly stated that, “This
team is another big one for us. They have to be considered
a big one because they have a Veteran football team.”

Victories for the Eagles so _far this season were over
Temple, Richmond, Villanova, and a 49-6 smashing .of Navy,
a club Pitftwbarely got by. An opening loss to WVU and
a narrow 14-6 defeat to Texas Tech last week blemish their
record. ' .

‘The ,veterans whom DePasqua refers to reside predomin-
antly on the defensive squad. All but one Eagle from last

year’s starting lineup return. In the past five games, the

Eagle defense has proved its reliability by yielding only 30
points.

Though BC’s offense hardly comes up to the likes of
Oklahoma and Penn State, the Eagles have been moving the
ball well on the ground so far. Halfback Tom Bougus,
after waiting behind Fred Willis for two years, has taken

..,$g

over where Willis left off at the end of last fall, as he»?-

racked up over 600 yards in the last four games of this year.

The game with BC is a big one for the Panthers for
another important reason. With this season essentially half
gone, the Cats are confronted‘ with the roughest portion of
their schedule and victories henceforth will be hard to pro-
cure. '

A loss this weekend for the Panthers could be devastating
morale wise to thelgridders considering that always tough
Syracuse is next followed by powerful Notre Dame.

In order for the Panthers to return from Boston a winner
this weekend, the offense must stay away from the fumbles
and interceptions which have -proved so costly in the last
three week's.About the only department where the Panthers
have beenconsistent is in the turnover category. If BC’s de-
fense continues its past performances, the Panthers will get
few opportunities to recover if they start to flounder. '

Unfortunately, DePasqua’s club may not be anywhere
near full strength again this week. The list of injured players
encompasses nearly every position and most of the injured
are just doubtful starters for BC.

Indeed, the BC game is a big one for the Panther grid
squad. DePasqua admits that the team’s best game was
against UCLA. Anything short of that West Coast effort may
once again leave Panther fans bragging about just the team’s
schedule. -

It must be the running at day-
break on the damp sandy beach
at Wildwood, N. J.. every summer
that makes Panther guard Rick
Lozier excel. He spends his vaca-
tion time as_a lifeguard at the
shore, with a two-mile job as part
of the rigorous daily routine.

Having started at guard for
eight consecutive contests over
the past two seasons, Lozier is ac-
customed to running through
some rugged defensive linemen
as one of Pitt’s trench fighters
and ironmen. '

Redshirted in 1969 due to a se-
vere stomach virus, Rick has per-

. formed against Navy and Tu-

lane despite a broken bone in his
right hand.

“I broke it (right hand) in the
first quarter against Navy,” ex-
plained Lozier. “I didn’t know how
bad it was until it was x-rayed af-

ter the game. The cast was on for '

only five days, because I couldn’t

wear it in the Sugar Bowl.”

A member of Dave Hart’s last
recruiting effort. Lozier is some-
what disappointed with the Pan-
thers’ present 2-3 mark.

“I really think we have a good
offense this year. It’s the best
since I’ve been at Pitt.‘ For some
reason, the team is missing all
the key plays. Every decent offen-
sive drive we put together is end-

, ed by an interception or a fumble.

leads the way for fullback Lou Julian '

against Oklahoma three weeks ago. Due to iniuries to John Simpson and
Dan Lynn, Lozier has alternated between both right and left guard this

DePasqua has decided to stick,

at least for the present, with one .

quarterback.. All three‘ have the
ability, but sending one in right
off the bench in the middle of the
game sometimes stalls our mo-

_ cause of their constant stunting."

Throughout the season, Rick
Lozier has been switching back
and forth between right and left
guard. Although he insists that
the alternating during practice
does not really affect him, Rick
acknowledges that it takes a cou-
ple minutes in a game situation
to make the necessary mental ad-
justment.

With co-captain John Simpson
and Dan Lynn being nagged by in-
juries this season, Lozier and Er-
nie Webster, formerly a tackle,
are paired up as the present guard
duo. A peek into 1972 reveals that
center Bob Kuziel, whom Lozier
greatly admires, will be the only
hole needed to be filled in the in-
terior line next year.

Ringing with praise for Kuziel.
Rick exclaimed, “‘Kuz‘ is the best
center in the East. He is vastly un-
derrated. It is great having him
beside me, because I know I can
always. count on him if I need
help."-

The meat of the pigskin sched-
ule lies before the Panthers dur-
ing the remaining six weeks of
the season. Lozier is r,eadily
aware of this fact, but is rather
confident of Pitt’s1 immediate fu-
ture. '

’ f‘People_ might think I’m1kid-
ding, but we can beat Notre Dame
on Nov. 7 if we can score two
touchdowns or so against them.
They (ND) have a terrific defen-
sive line, nevertheless, we can
beat them with a super effort.

“Penn State‘s‘ shutout, over
Syracuse, 31-0, surprised me.
State probably has the East‘s
number one team. “

When the Panthers glide into
Bost0n’s Logan International Air-
port on ‘Friday afternoon, only.
victory. will be on theirminds. For
junior guard Rick Lozier, it will
be a- test for his-ethereal hopes of -

Back in 1968. when Myslinski
took the job he also indicated

‘that Pitt would not have a team

“We intend to win,” he said

Right now, it would be im-

The ice hockey season is still at
month away, but what may be-

‘come the best team in Western

Pennsylvania has been working
out at the Alpine Chalet for al-
most two weeks now.

The Pitt skaters, stocked with
plenty of .experience and an ex-
cess of possible stand—outs, are
priming for their 1971 season
which begins Friday, Nov.i5, at
Gannon College in Erie.

Some of the names and ‘faces to
look for this year are Joe Testa,
defenseman and team captain,
goalie Mark Lieberman, center
Bill Glenville, wing Denny
Browne, and defensemen Kerry
Browne and Duke Schaeffer.

Also returning from the suc-
cessful ’70 squad will be wing
Mike Kohl, centers Dave Bahnson
and Tom Lang, and defenseman
Carl Grady. All these players will
be starting for the Pitt team and
promise to form a strong nucleus.

With over 30 skaters working at
the Chalet, the team has plenty of
depth. Two of the most promising
newcomers are forward Frank
Williams and wing Fred Wilson.

' Mark Lieberman, the squad’s
veteran goalie, expresses ex-
treme optimism at the skaters’
chance to go all the way this year.

“We play very small schools
and they can’t put up the teams

. that Pitt can,” Mark commented.
Captain Joe Testa guaranteed a ,

Pitt championship by the end of
this year’s campaign.

The squad’s home opener is
against Duquesne on Nov. 7, a
Sunday.
