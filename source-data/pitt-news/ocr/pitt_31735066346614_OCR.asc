Orientation Plans
Revised, Expanded

Freshmen entering the University next fall will meet a
more relaxed orientation program, according to Dr. William

B. Crafts, Dean of Men.
In an informal interview

over WPGH, Dr. Crafts dis-

closed that future plans call for a three-day orientation ses-
sion during the summer months for students who have been

Annual ‘Ugly

lllan’ Contest

Opens Monday

Alpha Phi’ Omega’s annual
“Ugly Man on Campus” contest
begins Monday, the national serv-
ice fraternity has announced. The
contest consists ofthe judging of
photographs of grotesque or ugly
faces submitted by student or-

. ganizations on campus. ,
The contest is highlighted byf

the “Ugly Man Dance,” the pro-
ceeds of which are donated to
charity. As the result of opinion
polls of various organizations and
students at the University, Alpha
Phi Omega has selected Chil-
drens’ Hospital as the recipient
of the dance proceeds.

Unlike previous years, partici-
pating organizations will b_e di-
vided into two groups. One group
will consist of all fraternities and
the other group ‘will
include all other recognized or-
ganizations on campus, including
residence halls.

Entrants may register with
Irene'Horduhay in the Student
Union office from Monday to Feb-
ruary 23 between 9 a.m. and 5
pm.

A letter will be sent to all cam-
pus organizations, informing them
of registration and contest pro-
cedure.

¢accepted by the University and

plan to enroll here in the fall.
The students will see “a slice of
University life through tours, re-
gistration, testing, and counsel-
ing.”

“This represents quite a change
from what’s been-done before,”
Crafts said. In the traditional ori-
entation week, he commented, ev-
erything is thrown “thick and
fast” at "the student in those few
crowded daysbefore the term be-
gins. “His head reels and he gets
confused.” I

Begins in Summer

In this more relaxed orientation
program, Craft continued, the ma-
jor eﬁort will be directed earlier
in the summer. The student will
be more receptive and will have a
chance to ask questions of both
the administration and the stu-
dents here for the spring trimester.
“Through this sample visit, the
student will gain a -better pers-
pective and become oriented at his
own pace.”

Discussing o t h e r matters,

‘ Crafts feels that in the next few
years there will be a larger per-
centage of students in residence.
“There will also be a stronger
stress on professional education
based on a strong foundationeof
Liberal, Arts,” Crafts said.

In addition, “there will be a
stronger emphasis on post—second-
ary education in the local com-
munity. We have been exploring
the possibilities of -informal cours-

Exhibit Now in SU Lobby

Sane Display Depicts Atomic Blast

Pittsburgh chapter of Student
SANE is sponsoring an exhibit in
the Student Union illustrating
through photographs, posters, and
literature the effects of an atomic
bomb blast on the city of Pitts-
burgh.

The exhibit, .which began on
Monday, will run through the en-
tire week, and will be open to the
public from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.

The exhibit consists of two large
posters, one of which is a map
of Pittsburgh showing the approx-
imate damage areas of an atomic

bomb, photographs illustrating the’

eﬁects of the atom bomb on Hiro-
shima, and literature explaining
the purpose of SANE and ex-
plaining the effects of a bomb
blast on Pittsburgh.

‘Becket’ C ostumer

 

PHILIP ECK ﬁnishes ﬁtting a costume for Channa Newman, one
of the players in the forthcoming Pitt Players production of
“Becket.” Eek designed the scenery and props for last fall’s “Julius
Caesar” as well as costumes and scenery for “Becket.”

Undergraduates Vote
Today on Referendum

University undergraduates vote today on whether or not
to continue Student Government.

Ballots are marked with three possible choices: SG presi-
dent Richard Sobota’s plan for reorganization, the abolition
of student government at the University, and the Reeves-

Slotkin plan for reorganization.

» e‘ Voting stands will be open to-
day from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. The
stands are in the SU front lobby,
in the Commons Room on the ﬁrst
floor of the Cathedral, in Engin-
eering Hall, and in the Health
Professions Building.

Students will be asked to show
their invoices when they vote. The
invoices will then be marked to
show that the student has voted.

Organizations’ Positions

Student leaders have offered
their opinions on the referendum.
SU Board’s position, stated by
Sheila Rinne, places it behind So-
bota’s reorganization plan. Cam-'
pus radio station WPGH is back-
ing the Reaves-Slotkin plan, while
The Pitt News is in favor of abol-
ishing student government.

Briefly, the President’s Plan
calls for a senate-like”"‘body
composed of presidents of exist-
ing governing bodies on campus,
and presidents of cabinets re-
presenting the schools of the
University.

The Representative Plan pro-
vides that each of the six schools
of the Universiiy receive two votes
per 500 studen" and that the vice-
president of ,,‘.i.ch of the seven
governing bodi_ 2.,-on campus re-
ceive a senate if t.

 

‘Optional’ Final
Reading Week
Also Studied

If plans now being studied
by an administrative commit-
tee are approved, University
students will have a ﬁnals

week with an optional read-

ing week preceding it.

Albert B. Martin, dean of the
School of Liberal Arts, said that
the faculties of each department
are being asked their reactions to
the proposed ﬁnals week arrange-
ments. '

The administrative committee
includes Richard Hodges, director
of the office of Student Records,
Arts director Martin,
chancellor of Planning, Edison
Montgomery, and Alan C. Rankin,
assistant chancellor of Student
and General Affairs.

Chairmen Approve _

In preliminary discussions, plans
for a formal ﬁnals week have
been approved by the chairmen
of the Humanities, Education, and
Natural Sciences departments.

Also agreeing with the idea
were the faculty of the Social
Sciences division and the dean.
of the Business Administration
department.

A reading week in preparation
for the ﬁnal week would be op-
tional with each department, ac-
cording to the requirements of in-
dividual cours_es. There would be
no classes during the reading
week.

‘Optional’ Emphasized

“I think it is appropriate that
the reading week be optional,”
Martin said, “because in some
courses, the student’s presence in
the classroom is more valuable
than a week of reading in

_ P1791)‘
aration for a ﬁnal.” ~
Student Records Director

Richard Hodges worked out a
master schedule for exams. A
spot check showed that no stu- .
dent would have more than two
ﬁnal exams on one day, but
Hodges plans to run a conclu-
sive check, using IBM cards
and a computor.

Final decision on the ﬁnal ex-«

amsweek will be made in two
weeks.

This reading week would enable
the students to catch up on any
material which they had neglected
during the term. -

something more than sit around

reading poetry, he returned to
the academic World.

It is Gilbert’s opinion that his
poetry definitely benefited from
his “beatnik phase.” All of his
poems were written after a major
experience in his life and be com
siders each, “the egg you lay after
eating the corn of experie.nce.”s

‘Enfant Terrible’

As to his University career, Gil-
bert admits he was rather an “en-
fant terrible.” He attended classes
‘when he thought the lecturer
worthwhile and neglected the re~
mainder.

He remembers two semesters
when he failed every subject
and at that point he left school
for two years of travel abroad.
At the termination of his trav-
els, he returned to the Univer-
sity to complete his studies. In
all, it took him ten years to ob-
tain his B.A.

Gilbert believes the reason for
his difficulties was a too rigid
system. of education which leaves
no room for the student who cares
to receive only an education, re-
gardless of grades.

Gilbert is remembered by Pro-
fessor Edwin Peterson, of the En-
glish Department, as being, “A
young man with a great deal of
talent but a ‘take charge’ type of
individual who seemed to have
trouble adjusting to the academic
life of the University.”

Attends Travel-.
Study Seminar

Problems encountered in stu-
dent. and faculty exchanges be-
tween various countries in the
Western Hemisphere were recent-
ly discussed at a week-long sem-
inar on the Educational Travel
Program.

The seminar was sponsored by
the U.S. Council for Student Trav-
el, and the Columbian Institute
for Advanced Training Abroad.

C. Scott Kelly, assistant direc-
tor of the Office of Cultural ‘and
Educational. Exchange, attended as
a representative of the University

Council for International Educa-
tional Exchange.

“Of the 100 people who i at-
tended the seminar, 35 were
Columbians, 35 came from the
lUnited States. and the others
were from various countries,”
Kelly said. “There were no rep-
resentatives from Cuba.”

“Our biggest problem,” he ex~
plained, “is that, while Latin
American students and faculty
want to come to the United States,

few from this country want‘ to go
to Latin America.” ‘
Kelly feels that the outlook for
increased exchanges is good be-
cause of President Kennedy’s Al-
liance for Progress and “increased
awareness by the academic com-
munity of the mutual beneﬁts

Letters to the Editor I

 Students Point,

Out ‘Opportunity’

it Editor, The Pitt News:

We were interested to read Jim
I-Iufnagel’s article, “Pitt for Sale”
in the January 31 issue of “The
Jim has said very
well what many thoughtful stu-
dents have been thinking con-

icerning the role undergraduates

can play in attracting freshmen

I . to Pitt.

Jim commented that “an op-
portunity forimore explicit pro-

“ motion arises less frequently but

can be even‘ more effective.” Jim

‘article that just such an opportu-
nity will arise _in the near future.

On March 10 and 17, identical
programs are being sponsored for

S; high. school seniors who have been

./admitted to the University for
next fall. We hope to give these
an idea of the
Vacademic, extra-curricular and
“social life at Pitt. On these two
days we will welcome approxi-
mately 600 prospective freshmen
to our "University.
Jim’s “opportunity . . .” is now
available. The program being
planned offers Pitt students an

opportunity to participate in two
 ways. About 150 men and women

S G Chairman

Charges ‘Apathy’

Editor, The Pitt News:

As chairman of the Student
Government meeting to explain
the reorganization proposals I
would like to thank you for the
article publicizing our meeting.
Further, I would like to publicly
thank the freshmen senators’
publicity committe who worked
so hard for the meeting. ‘

In the past months, ;he fresh-
men senators have tried to arouse
student interest in Student Gov-
ernmem through the “‘l\/Ieetc Your
Senator” program. They have all
met with failure.

We tried a student body meet-
ing to discuss a topic of foremost
importance and had a tremendous
publicity campaign which includ-
ed 75 signs throughout campus,
lThe Pitt News article,’ WPGH,
1,KQV and WRYT advertisements.
“Still we met with failure.

So now we must face facts —
blame lies with the students. They
are apathetic and willing to sit
back and criticize Student Gov-
ernment, but they“will not take
the time to attend meetings where
criticisms can be answered by
"Student Government representa-
tives.

Students scream that Student
Government is a “do-nothing” or-
ganization. Well, also it is a stu-
dent opinion sounding board -—
and when apathyis student opin-
ion, the soundingboard will echo
the same. _ .

For a “do-nothing”, organization
I feel that it has compiled a rec-
ord for. which it can be proud.
Now it’s time the students stopped
shifting the blame and started to
live up to their responsibilities.

Foreign S-Forurni No. 7,. .:

The Devil andthe Deep

 

  
 

The atmosphere on campus is tense as the hour
of decision draws near on the fate of Student Gov-
ernment.’ These last few days have been very hectic
for the proponents of the re—organization plans;
Messrs. Reaves, Slotkin and Sobota have been
making campaign speeches and
distributing explanatory pam-
phlets to drum up last minute
support for their plans. The big
wigs in the student organizations
have stated their preferences, so
the stage is all set for me to have
my say.’ Frankly, all these de-
bates and opinions do not help
anyone; theyonly confuse us.

The easiest way to deal with
the present problem has been

 

suggested in the editorial of The

Pitt News i.e. vote NO. I, however do not advocate
this extreme measure because that would be admit-
ting defeat without even a genuine attempt to form
I new representative body which would voice our
grievances, not that they are heeded, but it does
provide an outlet for our emotions unlike the form
they take in India (of riots). With this point con-
ceded it would seem that it does not matter which
plan we vgte for, yet I. have my preference.
Favors Representation

Being a foreigner I feel obliged to show through
my actions that I am wholeheartedly in favor of a
representative form of government be it in college
or politics. Though I may not know the candidate I

vote for, or his qualiﬁcations, at least he will have i

been democratically elected by me. I do not think it
matters thatthe President’s Plan would be more
efficient and would perhaps get better response
from the administration.

Who to Blame..'

° By Viiay Jain

If I were not a" foreigner and did not dread the .

Senate Committee on Un—American 'Activities, I
might have dared to intelligently weigh the pros

and cons of both the plans. Then it would be im. '

material to me whether I chose the student gov.
ernment officials or someone did it for me as long
as they served me efficiently to the best ofttheir
ability (which is not saying much from the Sam;
ples I have seen) and would undoubtedly vote for
the President’s Plan. v 

On taking a second look at both of the proposed-
plans I have come to the conclusion that both plans,

could greatly beneﬁt from redrafting and reorgana,
izing. However, this opportunity wisely‘ was not

A offered so now we .are asked to choose between the
devil and the deep. A word of caution before you.
make your ﬁnal decision (if someone has not a1.'l
ready made it for you) please do not lose sight:
of the fact that by your vote you will not only __d,e-a

cide how you would like to be mismanaged but also
how those who come to this institution in theyears
to come will be governed. S -
Responsibilities Continues _ . ~
I feel that your responsibility does not endwith

the casting of a ballot—for one of the plans but be-» . 

gins there. Either plan cannot be successful without
student interest and participation. It is our duty to
charter the course for our senators and keep them
in leash so that they may not get side-tracked from
their one duty - to serve only us. We must form an
opposition party and “thus keep in check the activ-
ities of the senate—like body under the President"s
Plan. Only by this constant struggle can we hope to

‘get a true and effective student government and
prevent it from degenerating from within. All this V
will require time and effort. “Is it worth it?” you I

ask. I think so. . -

  A Matter of

Indifference

. Today, University students will probably vote to

' abolish student ‘government in the referendum for

V reorganization of SG. I feel rather safe in this pre-

diction, for most of the student body here is usually

indifferent to what is going on around campus, or,
even worse, never takes the time
to ﬁnd out and is in complete ig- -
norance of the facts of university
life. _ _

Perhaps a valid excuse for
this would be that there are so a
many important things occurring '
throughout the world that no- ‘
body really has time to worry I
about SG. But, of course, this is
not the case. We know what we
can expect about 30*people at a
SU forum series program. And
the same can be said of any discussion on national

or. international “affairs. \

_ We should be able to draw theiconclulsion that
interest  school affairs and national affairs is _not
incompatible. Aside fromia few isolated instances,
the students who don’t give a damn about what-
goes on on this campus usually have the same at-
titude toward national and" internatiohal events‘
that are inﬁnitely more important.

Typiﬁes Apathy

.The attitude of students toward SG is typical of
this apathy, a wordthat has been used time and‘
again about Pitt students, but not without reason.
They know that there is a student government.
And with their traditional antagonism for’ people
who are sincerely interested in work for the Uni-
versity, they feel a_ certain measure of. resentment

for SG. In most elections this antagonism is re-

ﬂected by refusing to_vote. :But the ideal oppor-
tunity is now presented these people. Instead of
not voting, they will vote no. ‘That’ll teach those
busybodysa lesson,’ or so the general consensus
on this ‘campus seems to be."

This vote ‘will probably be recorded with a

minority of the electorate giving any thought at
all to the substance of the two plans involved‘
the President’s Plan and the Representative’s Plan.

The President’s Plan‘ seems, to be an ideal one

     
  
 

 

for this University, for, in practice, it nvlolves. ,1.

By Nathan Firestone

‘informal group of student leaders, the presidents

of major organizations, making any and all the
decisions that will have signiﬁcance for the stu-
dent body. It is ideal for Pitt because having this
group who modes-tly‘ refer to themselves as the
“Gavel Club” will alleviate the student body at
large of responsibility and concern for its decisions.
To Vote or‘. . . ?

There are two ways to vote for the President’s
P13” one Way is to simply vote no. By doing that
the “Gavel Club” will naturally drift toward a re-
sponsibility for aﬁairs that are outside its realm.
The other way, of course, is to vote directly for
this proposal. By all means vote for this if you
would prefer to discharge your responsibility to
a select group of students. ‘.

But one of the plans does represent a challenge

_ to the student body, and that is the Representative’s
. Plan orwthe-proposal worked out by Ray Reaves

and Bob Slotkin. By voting" for this plan, the stu-
dent will be taking responsibility, for the decisions
of SG. Its two outstanding features call for a strong

1 executive andmore proportional representation in

the Senate. It is not a radical departure from the
Way -Studentgovérnment, is now, but it does lay the
groundwork for an effective SG that will be able to
responsibly coordinate and govern, if necessary, a
ma.l01“i’fy 0f”"studer.1t activities.

-But it has one major deﬁciency — it asks too
much. of the student body, .for it is asking Pitt stu-
dents to govern themselves through’ a representa-
tlivevsystem that works. Because under this plan,
Senators will_be required to report back to their
constituents, it means that the constituents may be
forced. to think, and that word ranks somewhere
bﬁneath the four-letter epithet in general esteem
around here. ‘

Therefore, it would be best for University stu-
dents to forget-the Bepresentative’s Plan for it re-

squirés too much intelligent considei-,atio_n to really
Work Welpl. They probablylwill vote for no student
government at all.

And sometime next.‘ September a group of stu-
dents will get together and cry, “Why is the Gavel
Club running things around here? Let’s have a
$t“de“tg°Verhment that really works and one in
which ‘W€,,the students, are represented. Don’t we

Group to Recreate

lmloiiesian Crisis

A group of University stu-
dents will decide what steps,
the Soviet Bloc nations should
take in the Berlin crisisinext
week.

They will be assuming the
roles of the various Soviet Bloc
leaders in st.rategy games design-
ed by the International Relations
Club.

Club president Charles Shaffer
said that some roles for the meet
ings are still open. He empha-
sized that students participating
need no “wealth of information”

for the games. “Most of us just op-
erate from general information

available in newspapers and ma-
gazines,” he said.

The meetings, supposedly held
in Moscow, will be discussions
led by “Khrushchev.” The play-
ers will act to situations which
include the incidents in Berlin
and Indonesia just as they think
the countries they represent
would react.

“We’re trying to acquaint inter-
ested students with the various
countries in the Soviet Bloc,”
Shaffer explained. “We’d like to
get students to come, so they can
learn from others and contribute
information.”

Sessions scheduled for this
month are February 11, 18, and
25 on the fourth floor of Bruce-
Hall. Sponsors of the Interna-
tional Relations Club are pro-
fessors Carl Beck, R. W. Cottam,
Irwin J. Schulman, and Joseph
J. Zasloﬂ of the Political Science
Department.

Last trimester the club sponsor-
ed roleplaying games for South
American countries concerning a
hypothetical uprising in Vene-
zuela.

Two Debaters

Victorious
In Jamaica

Two University debators have‘
returned victorious from a recent
trip to the University of the West
Indies in Jamaica.

The debators, Joseph Hallal and
Willis Higgins, debated the affir-

mative on the topic, Resolvedzt

That the Monroe Doctrine is Far-
cial. Hallal and Higgins won that
and also .a debate in Mandeville
with the Alumnai Jamaica Speech.
Club on the topic, Resolved: That
the Race to the Moon Leads No-
where.

Last weekend the team of Jim
Joseph, Stan Goorin, Doug Curtis
and Scott Sibert had a 4-2 record
at Marietta College. The record
gave them a third place position
in the Ohio tournament.

They debated the topic, Re-
solved: That Labor Organiza-
tions Should be Under the
Jurisdiction of Anti-trust Legis-
latoin. James Seabel, an assist-
ant director of debate, accom-
panied the debators to the tour-
nament.

The same national topic was de-
bated at Harvardrby David Mish-
elvich, Raymond Krotec, Larry
Profant and Ed Barker.

tions has been compressed intolerably. Today’s military
leaders must have help in commanding forces of awesome
‘strength. They need great quantities of information elec-
tronically transmitted, processed and displayed. This is the
challenge of command and control . . . the work of the men at
MITRE.

Formed under the sponsorship of the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, MITRE is a growing engineering
research corporation with 1,600 employees, over 600 of which
comprise the technical staff. It serves as technical advisor to
the U. S. Air Force and other government agencies and en-
gages in system design, conceptual planning, evaluation of
electronic systems and research development.

Appointments will be made principally inthe Suburban
Boston area. Openings are also available at facilities in
Washington, D. C. and Colorado Springs, Colo. Brochures

“Good psychology is also the basis of all teamwork.
And, since most of today’s business and scientific prob-
lems are too complicatedfor ‘one man’ solutions, team-
work is essential. If you want to be a valuable team player,
and a likely candidate for captain, be the person who
understands people. Learn what it takes for people to

“Bear this in mind, too. World tension, community

facts of everyday life. The more you know of human
behavior, the better prepared you will be to deal with

psychology elective into your schedule. I don’t think
you’ll regret it . . . I know I didn't.”

Haven’t Lost Yet
Peery Faces

Son In iMatch
This Weeliend

By BOB SMIZIK
Father and son will match wits
when the Panther wrestlers take

on Navy at Annapolis on Satur- 
day. Rex Peery will have the un- 

enviable task of trying to beat
his son, Ed, present Navy coach
and former NCAA champion for
Pitt.

It will be no easy feat for the

veteran mentor and his team.
Navy has a ﬁne squad, and al-
though it is doubtful that they
are as strong overall as the Pan-
thers, they possess enough good
wrestlers to spring an upset.

The top match of the day, in
what could be a preview of the
Eastern 137 pound championship,
will pit John Zolikoff against
Navy’s Mike Harmon. Harmon
was a third place ﬁnisher in last
year’s Easterns and from his win
against Lehigh’s Curt Alexander
must rate as the leading contender
for Eastern honors along with
Zolikoff. .

Daryl Kelvington will not
have an easy time getting back
on the winning ‘track. He meets
Mike McGrath, a top notch
grappler, who ﬁnished fourth in
last year’s Easterns.

Jim Harrison will have his
hands full with Pete Nelson at 167
pounds as will Ken Barr with
Tom Uber at 177 pounds. Wayne
-Laribee could also cause trouble

Rex Peery is expecting a close
match. “I don’t think the meet
will be decided until the ﬁnal two
matches,” the coach commented.

The Panthers’ number four
ranking in the nation makes them
favorites over Navy. All it takes,
however, on Navy’s part is ﬁve
wins. They have ﬁvegood men so
the match should be close. One
thing is certain, Peery will win.

JIM O'BRIEN

Sports Editor

. GRADE TIME AGAIN
Rod Thorn, the budding‘ All-American guard of West
Virginia, is trying to forget a lot of things lately. According
to his biographers, he tries to quit worrying so much about
his studies, tries to forget bad ball games, bad shots and
bad moments in general.
If Thorn had his pick of the moments uppermost in his
mind which he would like to forget, he’d probably try to erase 80
minutes of his court life in comforting amnesia. They were his
frustrating moments against Pitt’s basketball team last year when
he looked like an All-American ﬂop.
“My parents wanted me to make good grades,” Thorn said,
“and a point where it got real bad was when we played Pitt in
January at Pittsburgh. Night before I stayed up all night and
I studied for an 8 a.m. exam.

“I had never made a C in my life. I didn’t
gwant one. I was afraid I’d go to pieces. I’ve got
' so much hypertension I can stay on top for a while.
It didn’t bother me on the test, but that night I
§couldn’t dunk the ball during layup warmup and
it was the first time since high school. I didn’t tell
-the coach how I felt because I thought once the
game started I’d still have a good game in me.

“I scored eight points and was terrible.
Instead of just forgetting about it, I had the
‘ rabbit ears. From the stands, I heard, ‘You

R01) THORN couldn't hold West’s shoes.’ I thought I was
losing what ability I had. You can't ever afford another game
like that I told myself after it was over.”
Thorn couldn’t sleep nights after that, and he missed three games.
“I wasn’t that physically sick,” Thorn admitted. “What was really
the crux, I was so far behind in school and I didn’t give a damn.

“The game after one I sat out was four days later against Pitt
at home,” Thorn said. “I based all my hopes on redeeming myself
that night. I’d been in bed for nearly a week, I was down to 167.
Still, beat Pitt was my game. On the opening center jump, the ball
was tipped to me. I started down the ﬂoor and fell on my face. I
took four shots and made six points. Then I came down on the side
of another player’s foot and hurt my ankle.”

So Rod Thorn scored 14 miserable points against Pitt last
year. But his redemption plan is half way toward success. He
scorched the Panthers with 30 points at Morgantown two weeks
ago in a 88-78 win, and looked like a thoroughbred All-American.

Thorn has been sick lately, and missed the last game. His return
to Pitt may be another nightmare. West Virginia will lose tonight
and Rod Thorn will not score 15 points.

Be sure to watch the WVU pre-game drills. It’s quite a show
and see if Thorn’s dunking the ball. Could be a tip-off.

Mounties  
After No. 12 -
Against Cats

It will be a gross disaster if

_ the Panthers fall to the visit-

ing West Virginia Mountain-
eers. A setback would be the
twelfth in succession, and to-
night’s contest -seems like an
oppurtune time to end the mono-
tony.

WVU turned the trick at Mor-
gantown two weeks ago, 88-78,
for the eleventh victory, but Coach
Bob Timmons’ boys were always
in contention with a senior—less
ball club, and the Mountaineers
were only ﬁve points better at
home.

game all day.” WVU Coach

ing. “It’s very

ing when you

Rod Thorn blitzed the Panthers’
defenses last time out for 30 points
to keep the streak intact, but he
was outscored by a man who im-
pressed Coach King quite a bit——
Elrian Generalovich, who scored
WVU tub—thumper Edgar Bar-
rett describes Generalovich as .“a
burly 6-4 forward with the touch
of a violinist and the moves of a
ballet dancer.” If he can “out-
twist” Thorn tonight, the drought
may end. '

Tough Navy Team Hosts

Cat Gymnastics'Squad

Pitt gymnasts will try to better
their 4-2 season record when they
travel to Annapolis, Maryland,
this Saturday for their meet with
Navy.
~ Both the Temple" coach and the
Springﬁeld coach feel that Pitt
and Navy are about equal. The
difference of the meet may be de-
cided by Pitt’s Earl McConnell
who is not only one of the best
floor exercise men in the Eastern
League but is coming into his
own on the parallel bars.

BASKETBALL

Students who plan to attend
the Pitt-VVest Virginia basket-
ball game tonight should pre-
sent. their invoices at the Stu-
dent Desk, CL, or at the Health
Professions Building. Tickets
for the game will be issued free.

Busy Weeliend
Looms Ahead

For Swimmers

A busy weekend awaits the
Panther swimming team “with
matches against Bucknell and
Syracuse on Friday and Saturday
nights respectively. Both meets

will be held at the opposition’s 7

pool.

Last year the Panthers slapped
a 57-38 defeat on Bucknell, but
this year the Lewisburg lads are
expected to be tougher.

The Bisons are paced by two
Middle Atlantic Conference cham-
pions, Bill Wearstyne and Bill
Dorr. Dorr is expected to give
Pitt’s only unbeaten swimmer,
Steve Ganong, a tough time in the
long distance free style events,

While the Bucknell meet will be
an important test for the mermen,
it is Syracuse which is expected
to provide the stiffest competition
of the weekend. 7

Coach Ted Weber appears to
have a ﬁne squad to send
against ‘the Pittsburghers. Bob
Ohman, the top point earner
from last year’s team, Jeremy
Rosenthal, Greg Pond and Jim
Tuck are sure to give the Pan-
thers trouble.

Pitt coach Ben Grady has the
highest regard for the Syracuse
team. “They have a tough all
amund Squad,” says the mentor,

“and over all they are extremely
good)’ .

The Panthers will take impres-
sive credentials with them this
weekend. Not only do they have a
ﬁne 4-1 record following Satur-
day’s win‘ over NYU, but they
have also set seven University re-
cords thus far this year. The most
pleasant feature of the assault on
the record books is . that sopho-
mores have led the way, which
augers. well for the future.
