favorite of America's College Queens?

Actually there are many reasons. Artcarved diamond rings
 must meet traditionally high standards for color, cut, clarity _
and carat weight. Their awardwinning styles are a delight
to the eye. And, they take all of the guesswork out of buying
a diamond. Every Artcarved ring carries a written guarantee
for quality and permanent value that's recognized and re-
spected by fine jewelers from coast to coast. We think you'll

agree with America's lovely College Queens.
Stop in at your jeweler and be sure to see all the exqtiisite
Artcarvecl diamond rings-the rings you buy with conﬁdence

and wear with pride.

The Application Of Knowledge . . .‘~

Peculiar Paradox

budget?” appeared in a political science exam,

By Jim Hufiiagel

Several days ago I attended a press conference
which revealed a peculiar paradox: Students, even
though they may be both well-informed and well
educated, often lack the ability to correlate the in-
formation they have received outside the classroom
with those concepts they have learned inside.

The occasion was a special press conference
which ‘allowed the editors of
Pennsylvania college newspapers
t.o meet with Governor Law- '
rence in an unrehearsed inter-
view. .

Many of these students,
seemingly well informed on cur-
rent events, were able to raise f
issues which impressed (and oc- .
casionally frightened the Gov- 
ernor. But more than once  '
many of these same students
displayed a shameful inability to
apply their information to elementary principles
which any high school senior could have parroted
back without hesitation.

Most of the misunderstandings seemed to arise
over ﬁnancial issues, perhaps a dirty subject to all
but economics and accounting majors, but so ele-
mental, a concept insofar as general government
economics are concerned, that it leaves little lati-
tude for misunderstanding.

 

 

every one of these studentswould have taken only.
a moment to chuckle at the teacher’s naive under-

estimate of their abilities before hurridly scrawlingv.

a more than adequate explanation.
Eventually the Governor had to explain that‘
theoretically a government should Spend 01113’ 38'

much as it can obtain through taxation and that it

to lower or mollify taxes causes a decrease in the
beneﬁts it can extend.

His explanation marked a return to intelligent?"

questioning. One student asked, “If taxes cannot
be lowered, can they be modiﬁed so as to distribute’
the burden more equitably?” The question'led'
directly to the 4 per cent sales tax and implied
criticism that such a measure was unfair to those
in the lower income categories.

The Governor answered somewhat cautiously
that, yes, he did believe the sales tax may be un-
just, particularly to those living in “depressed
areas,” and that in its place he might favor a
graduated income tax. "

The Governor’s caution was justified; almost
immediately a student asked him why the gradu-
ated income tax was more equitable and implied"
that he considered the Governor’s alternative‘
notion akin to state ownership of steel mills or
“taxation without representation.” Until it was
pointed out to them that they or their parents had
been paying a graduated income tax to the federal

Webster’s New

Dictionary

 W79 bster Releases First

Dictionary In 2 7 Years

By RAISHA SILBERMAN

The release of Webster’s controversial newest edition of
the famous unabridged dictionary gives up its right to pre-
scribe correct usage for recording language in its current

state.

According‘ to a recent issue of “Business Week,” the new
dictionary could prove to be 20 years ahead of its market.

Vl7ebster’s Third New Interna-.
' tional Dictionary, the first new

Webster's in 27 years, has cost the
G. C. Merriam Co. $3.5 million
for editorial effort and typesetting
alone._

The new approach by Merriam
is considered risky and perhaps
premature, because it stirs up a
controversy between the academ-
icians, who now control the school
market, and the promoters of a
new science, that of linguistics.

Advocate Prescription

Since Dr. Johnson ﬁrst publish-
ed his famous lexicon in 1755,
have been mostly
prescriptive, establishing what is
right in meaning and pronuncia-
tion. The academicians advocate
this form.

Linguistics strives to describe
a language in its present state,
without getting into judgments
of what is correct.

Merriam is looking to a much
broader market than in the past.

Advertising expenditures, which
for a six month period have been
doubled to launch the book, are
described as “the greatest con-
centration of advertising ever

‘used by any publisher to promote 7
'5 any single book," according to

Gordon J. Gallan,
the company.

The Third New International
will be useful to a wider audi-
ence. lt records the English
language as written and spoken,
and, as its Preface states, “un-
dertakes to provide for changes
in all classes or words as mani-
fested by what people want to

read, discuss and study.”

UNUSUAL JOE BELLINO

Joe Bellino, the Navy’s super scoring torpedo of last year's
Orange Bowl club, was at the brig on lvlonday at the Curbstone
Coaches’ luncheon in the Roosevelt Hotel ballroom. Acting as the
vanguard for the 1961 edition of the Middies, the All—Amcrican
halfback assumed the press "agentfs role, and stiff-handed the ques-
tions peppered his way as if they were merely scrub tacklers.

The compact bulldozer‘ spoke very ﬂuently, wore a whimsical
grin and an impressive blue uniform, and sparkled his talk with
delightful bits of humor. “This is not a great Navy team," he re-
marked, “but it’s a darn good one.”

Bellino seemed to be hedging for a team with a 4-1 record, but

indicated that Navy hesitated somewhat before giving the Panthers
a serious look after the locals had dropped four straight. “Our
coach, Wayne Hardin, says that Pitt has the material to beat anyone
on their schedule; it’s just a
question of when they’re going to
start.”

“This was an unpredict-
able team this year. VVhy we
have 20 sophomores on our
team out of 3-1. Now that's
unusual. Why our coach had
them practice right through
weekends and holidays to
get in shape, and that’s un-
usual.

“You know. 'we don’t get the
cream of the crop like people
think. We get quantity, but not
quality. We get the third team all-
stater, not the big star. You have
to have at least a 510 on college
board scores to get in Navy, and
A V ‘ that’s real. unusual. Our boys have
to be good a ademically, and that kind of a kid .is hard to ﬁnd."

A ‘coach’ in the crowd wanted to know if it was a policy of
Navy’s to bring in “light, scrappy kids to play ball.” ‘

“That’s not a policy of the academy." Bellino sighed. “We bring
in fellas that go around 225. but they shrink once they get to school.
We do nothin’ but run and run during practice and all that excess
weight evaporates. It’s amazing to see even 185 pounders dwindle
to 150.

“I remember when I went to practice for the all-star game last‘
season how a lot of the fellas were beeﬁn’ about how ‘hard the practice
sessions were. I couldn’t understand it; I thought they were rather
easy compared to ours.”

Bellino spoke awhile about the spirit that prevails at An-

W napolis that makes Navy a great team year in and year out. “Why
our Midshipmen just won’t accept a loser, that's all. Sometimes
our band comes out and plays at practice. M

“When we lose we’re liable to get cracked in the head by some
‘A’ student who hates to lose, or slapped in the check with a slide-
rule or something. When our boys get down on the ﬁeld, we have
3,800 Middies to arouse their spirit. They won’t l.ct_us lose.”

Bellino explained that he is obligated to serve four years in the

service. “I'm going to be assigned to a destroyer leader out ot‘.‘Nor-
folk soon," he said, “and I’m not looking forward to it. I get sea sick, ,

“If our sophomores perform

Pitt‘s Bob Tarkany, individual

pointment so far this season, is
still plagued by an ankle injury

Navy has already posted a sur-
prising 4-l record to date, and the
host Panther team has the un-
enviable “under-dog” role once
again, as they put their 1-4 record
on the line. The 1-4 mark is a
glaring set of numerals, but there
are some others, perhaps more
revealing. that explain the Pan-
thers’ failures this fall.

Another more pleasant note is
that we have fumbled six fewer

89 fewer yards. Rick Leeson paces
the runners with 206 yards on 47

Paul Martha has the best average

“A cynic,” said Oscar
Wilde, “is a man who
knows the price of
everything and the
value of nothing."

We meet Cynics
occasionally, but
they begin to look
at things a little
differently after
seeing price and
value in action
together.

lf you are a cynic, let
us go to work on you.
