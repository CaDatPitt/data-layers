Continued Education pp

by IAN ISEN
A multitude of problems is faced by women wishing to

return to college to complete their education. The Office of ‘

Continuing Education for Women was established in Janu-
ary, 1964, to help integrate these women in the-University

community. .

"Mrs. Caryl M. Kline, director of the office, interviews
perspective students, and explains all the aspects of the life
they will lead at the University. She also arranges their
schedules with them so that they still have time to devote

to their families._

Mrs. Eileen Brown, one of the-

women under Mrs. Kline’s guid-
ance, stated that, “She (Mrs.
Kline) understands adult prob-
lems with children and family
bec-a-use she has lived through
this experience herself. She
helps cut obstacles down to
size.”

Mrs. Brown returned to school
after a 13-year career in theater,
which began at the Playhouse

Now a married women with two‘

children; Mrs. Brown has re-
turned to school to “do some-
thing with my spare time” and
to “give an added sense of se-
curity to my husband and fami-
ly; without whom she would
never had continued my educa-
tion.” A senior at the University,
Mrs. Brown hopes to enter law
school next fall. .

A stud-ent in elementary edu-
cation, Mrs. Margaret DeMarco

‘made Dean’s list last Winter

Trimester. A former secretary,
she is a widow with two chil-
dren. Her education here has
helped her develop a “heighten-
ed sensitivity to everything.”

Mrs. Edna Mackenzie attended
night school for several years
before coming to Mrs. Kline’s
office. As a future secondar_v
school teacher she feels that she
is needed in the community.
She explained that through ,ﬁam-
ily co-operation she can “ﬁt
more into a day-than I believed
possible.”

Another woman attaining
Dean’s List status for last Win-
ter Trimester is Mrs. Phoebe
Williams. Also a widow with
two children, Mrs. Williams com-
mutes from Washington, Pa.,
to begin a career in elementary
education. She noted that her
children feel that it is a “novel-
ty to have mom in school.”

All of the women feel that
their being in school creates a
healthy academic atmosphere
around the home.

The women stated that they
have had no trouble adjusting
to their new surroundings. Mrs.
Brown noted that “I established
a rapport with the younger stu-
dents.” By talking to them she
“ﬁnds out all about various pro-
fessors.”

All four women agreed that
"the kids have been marvelous."

MENTOR APPLICATIONS
Mentor applications can now
be picked up in the Dean of
Women’s office, 1209 CL, from
Mrs. Martin. Any undergrad-
uate woman who will have
completed 60 credits by Aug-
ust, 1968, is eligible to be-
come a mentor for the 1968-
69 school year. I

experience. When I left Wil-
liamsburg three days later, I
was sorely disappointed.

From the moment I met the
seven other student reporters
representing the United States
S t u d e n t Press Association
USS-PA I was somewhat troubl-
ed by wh-at I considered an over-
zealous and distorted search for
duplicity on the part of Pres-
ident Johnson, the man who
had inspired the conference a
year ago. While I could accept
anti-Vietnam conversation with
equanimity, other far-reaching,
unfounded criticism became ex-
tremely unpleasant.

Perhaps it all began when we
privately interviewed Dr. James
Perkins, president o-f Cornell
Univ-er-srity and chairman of the
Conference. Several of my col-
l-eagues rather crudely queried
Dr. Perkins on what President
Johnson planned to “gain” from

the conference. When Dr. -Per- I

kins replied that President
Johnson simply had a very sin-
cere interest in education that
he would like to see equalled
elsewhere in the world, the in-
questionors leaned aback, looks of
disbelief on their faces. It soon
became obvious that it was the
opinion of the questionens that
President Johnson had some
ulterior motive for convening
this meeting — the ihackeyed
“power hunger.”

Delegate

Our next interview was with
D01l8“las Cater, special assistant
to the President for education.
The same pattern arose. Again
unsatisfied with the answer to
the perennial question, the in-
quirers began to quiz Cater on ,
his beliefs concerning Vietnam,
the draft, and the House Un-
American Activities Committee.
Cater’s Pleas of his superﬁcial
knowledge on these matters
was met with an attitude rent
with the contention that Cater
is either a fool or a liar. Cater
reacted to this disrespect quite
admirably — perhaps too much
so.
The political orientation and
learning of the two officers ‘of
the USSIPA at the conference
became quite apparent when the
organization’s Edu-ca-tcionai Pro-
gram Director «began to pound
out a seven-page manifesto that
he wanted each ‘student to sign.
In essence, the paper proclaimed”
the icoriference a “failure” be-
cause the conference had no
student delegates. (All this
came after Dr. Perkins had ex-
plained to us, of his own vol-
it.ion, that students were not in-
vited as delegates because they,
quite frankly, have no exper- '
tise on theﬁissue at hand and
-because student presence would
present .a nearly insurinountable"‘
logistics problem.)

The all day conference cover-
ed topics ranging from the ethi-
cal responsibility of leadership
to management techniques.

Students who attended the
conference were favorably im-
pressed. Martin Goozh, Men’s
Dorm Council (MDC) represen-
tative to the conference, said
that it was an “excellent pm-
gram.” Other observers stated
that “the program was well
planned.

“I really enjoyed the confer-
ence,” said one participant, “it
challenged my concepts of lead-
ership and taught me a great
deal about people.” _

Jonathan Meyers, president of
Druids and organizer of the con-
ference, thought that “the pro-
gram was successful. It wiped
out the bad connotation connect-
ed with leadership conferences ,
on this campus. I

“The program «also introduced

 

l to the participants the theoreti-

cal and practical aspects of lead-
ership,” said ‘Meyers. He also
suggested that the scheduling of
another conference next term is
a possibility.

DEBATE CHANGED

The Public Parliamentary
Debate on “Resolved: That
this house condemns Israeli
occupation of Arab territory”
originally scheduled for to-
morrow has been postponed
until Dec. 5 at 3:15 p.m. in

Impressions Of A Concert

CliburnPlaysFavoriteChopin

by HOBART HARRIS

I went to see Van Cliburn
Saturday night. It was the ﬁrst
time, and I had to -admit that I
didn't know what to expect. You
tell people that you’re going to
something like that, and you
hear things, little things, anec-
dotes, stories of the time they
saw Van Cliburn, who they
went with.

Van Cliburn was playing Chop-
in, and that was the second
problem—I had heard very lit-
tle of Chopin, and I vaguely
had the feeling he wasn’t for me
—I like Beethoven. So there if
was Van Cliburn and Chopin.

What to make of it? ,
I One thing is for sure——on a

Saturday night, Sol Hurok will
never have any -worries about
covering his costs for producing
a concert with Van Cliburn ——
the Syria Mosque was packed,
except for a few seats in the
back rows of the first balcony.
Perhaps somebody’s kid was
sick, maybe somebody left his
tickets in the pockets of his
other coat. Twenty dollars down
the drain.

Van Cliburn is tall. Perhaps

Montoya, Famous Guitarist,
Performs At Carnegie Hall

The world renouned Flamencio guitarist, Carlos Montoya, will
perform at Carnegie Music Hall Saturday at 8:30 p.m.
The Flamenco excellence of Montoya has been heard in vir-

tually -every outpost of the free
world from the US and Canada
‘to Europe and the Orient.
Wherever he has gone, Montoya
-has elicited critical acclaim and
audience approbation.

Montoya has also won world-
wide acclaims for his numerous
recordings and has become the
living symbol of Flamenco mu-
sic, the world over.

He was the ﬁrst Flamenco
guitarist ever to display his ar-
tistry in a solo concert. His ad-
vanced technique, his ﬂair for
inventive innovation and his in-
ﬁntely varied repertoire repre-
sent creative playing in the full-
est sense of the word.

All seats will be reserved for

the performance. The prices will

range from $3.30 to $6.60. Tick-
ets can be purchased at Atlas
Travel Agency, Ho-rne’s, the
Book Center, and Gimbels.

as tall as six seven or  eight.

And with his tails he looks like ‘

a circus tall man. I wonder why
he took up the piano? When he
walks on stage, he must pass
through a door cut out of dinghy
light-blue panelling that lines
the back and sides of the stage.
He ﬁts under it by no more than
an inch. When architects design
their stages, do they take into
account Cliburn’s size? Perhaps
somewhere, in an architects’
book of physical standards, there
is a unit called a “Cliburn” -—
the minimum height allowable
for entrances to concert stages.

The audience applauded as he
walked across the stage, but the
applause was strange—respect-
ful but not warm—-a seeming
ccntradiction—cold applause for
someone who is about to play
Chopin.

But the concert did not begin
with Chopin — it began with
Francis Scott Key. Cliburn comes
from Texas.

We all stood up, stared at
nothing in particular, and bore
out our National Anthem in si-
lence. When it was over, people
sat down, looked at each other,
and wondered what to do. At a
ball game, we’d all cl1eer. But
at a concert? Patriotism is us-
ually a prelude to violence.

The concert began with the
Fantaisie in F minor, opus 49.
I think I had only heard it once-
or twice before; I don't even
know if I had heard the whole
thing. But I knew that I had,

and that realization alone is
worth something —- the fact that
you’re not a .total dude. It gives
you a feeling of belonging, of
sharing, of perhaps having some-
thing to say about the perform-
ance once its’ over: “Don’t you
think Serkin did it a lot better
than Cliburn did?”

The best thing about the con-
cert, however, -is the way that
the music can pick you up and
carry you away into your own
thoughts, your own feelings.
Your whole day 'passes in fI‘Or1-‘C
of you but reorchestnated, col-
ored more brightly. What Cli-
burn’s playing does to the audi-
ence is to produce a kind of
inspired daydream through a
majestic night.

Conference Hosts Scholars A Sponsor Conference

(Continued from Page 1)

.The cake’s proverbial icing
came when news arrived that
President Johnson would visit
the conference on Sunday eve-
ning and receive selected mem-
bers of the press, us included,
Immediately, comments about
politicing a n d glory - seeking
monopolized the conversation of
the USSPA officers and most. of
the student journalists. Th ey
awaited the President with a
kind of preverted anxiety en-
couraged by the USSPA offi-

‘C€lI‘S.

When the President arrived,
I was honored to meet him and
John Gardner, Secretary of
Health, Education, and Welfare.
We were advised that President
Johnson would make a short
speech after dinner. During :1
really pleasant meal, I was ap-
proached by one of my col-

1' leagues from the USSPA and

asked not only to walk out on
President Johnson when he be
gan to speak, .but also to sub-
mit my name to members of the
national networks and wire ser-
vices present. I refused and was
met with the kind of stars re-
served for anlyp the most un-
principled of apostates.

The conspiring reporters did
notvvall: out, but trouble re-
sulted nevertheless. It seems
that two USSPA representatives
claimed that several Secret Ser-
vicemen ushered them out of
the dining room when the plan
they so boldly broadcasted was
overheard. After the‘ President's
departure, -the USSPA reporters
involved in -this episode dissem-
inated to about 250 men of the
working press a rel-ease claim-
ing they were “forcibly ejected”
from the dining room. Many of
the cor‘-respondents phoned their
papers and informed them of
what -had allegedly occurred

students involved. The students’
behavior was severely admon-
ished by countless correspor»
dents from myriad journals
throughout the world.

The basic grounds for objec-

tion were best stated by a local

newspaperman who roared, ”I
walk into this conference as a
journalist and walk out of it
as a student.” It certainly was
not professional, most others
agreed. The students defended
themselves voicefully by claim-
ing that their student status
permits—even condones — their
actions.

There is a good deal to be
learned from these episodes.
First, “the USSPA is peopled
with personnel more interested
in conjuring a non-existent
story about how student opin-
ion is crushed than on reporting
clearly and factually for the 350
student newspapers it serves.
Second, a large segment of to-
day's collegiate population con-
strues its student status to be
complete license to act uncivil-
ly, rudely, and impulsively.

-Third, the concept of the Of
fice of the President of the
United States as an entity re-
gardless of who holds‘ the post
.-is completely misunderstood.
There was virtually no respect
or deference for the Office of
President, Fourth, the prospect
of humiliating our President in
front of 175 scholars from
around the world Was sanction-
ed, ‘indeed incited, by an organ-
ization that is subsidized by edu-
catlional foundations for the ex-
pressed purpose of reporting in-
telligently on academic matters
for its readership of over two
million. - “ii

The behavior of the USSPA
students was inexcusable from
the start. Most annoying is the
fact that the USSPA students
would take advantage of the lav-
ish benefits and privileges ac-
corded them by the press staff,
yet shed «the duty of being eth-

-ical reporters to -don the -role of

student activists at their con-
venience. The fact that over two

Our Pitt News correspondent’s experience with the United States

 Student Press Assodiation (USSPA) this past weekend unfortunately

was not ‘unique. The same preoccupation with politics to the neglect of

" journalistic responsibilities was noticeably evident at USSPA’s national

convention this summer. - _
All of'th.is leads to the question “What is the role of a student

1 journalist?” We disagree with those officials of US-SPA who feel they

continually have the option to disregard their responsibilities as journal-
ists and become political acﬁivitist whenever they so choose. The situation
at Williamsburg was a much more ﬂagrant violation of journalistic re-
sponsibility than USSPA’s convention as the student journalists were
reporting on an international event attended by world-renowned figures
and even the President of the United States. The students were also ac-
corded the same privieges granted to.the working process. It is lamentable
that they faltered in the face of these circumstances. .

We must seriously question the operation of USSPA and the license

its officials feel they have to make their own news and print the results

of their efforts. At this particular assignment at Williamsburg, the

 students journalists chosen were told beforehand that it would be their

responsibility to cover the conference for the national news service USSPA

s V provides.

‘VVhite Armbands

Editorial: A Lost Opportunity

USSPA officials specifically requested that the selected newspapers
send sophomores or juniors to enable the partidipating students to most
effectively utilize their experience at the Conference for their respective
newspapers. A more honest criterlion might have been the waiving’ of journ-
alistic qualifications to the fulfillment of acceptable political credentials,
such as an ‘opposition to the President of the United States and an willing-
ness to storm out of his press conference to demonstrate this opposition.

Student journalists are continually clamoring for the same privileges
accorded members of the working press. When they are granted these
rights, as in Williamsburg, it is disheartening that the unacceptable ac-

tions of a few were witnessed by not only correspondents throughout the

nation, but the leading educational figures throughout the world.
As one newspaperman remarked to one student, “I am appalled that
you could walk into this conference as a j ournallistist and walk out of it as a
student.” We concur that this rationale is totally unacceptable under any
circumstance. Unfortunately, it was sanctioned and practiced by an or-
ganization that is supposed to give guidance to the hundreds of college
newspapers throughout the country that subscribe to its services.
, Student journalists have so few opportunities such as this past
week-end’s Conference. How deplorable that they had to fumble the ball
when they finally made it to the major league.

A Symbol of Life

Douglas Stanton appar-
ently has discovered the
power of telepathy. In his
column in Monday’s Pitt
News he thrust upon us his

4 analysis of the reason why

members of the University
community have been wear-
ing white armbands for the
past two Wednesdays.
Unlike Mr. Stanton, I do
not know why the white
armbands are being worn.
But I do think that those

» who wear them do so not to

impress tliéii‘ friends 6'1‘
shock their families but be-
cause they are sincerely

- concerned about the war in
_Vietnam.

The war has escalated to
the point where there can

1 no longer be any apathy
"among thinking members of

society. Our nation’s actions
in Southeast Asia are clear-
ly endangering the welfare
and indeed the future of the
whole world. Those who

wear the armbands realize.

this danger; if they did not
they W.ould not wear the

bands. War is not a subject

for equivocation.

Mr, Stanton further as-
serts that white is the color
chosen because it symbolizes
surrender. By this logic,
then, the red in-the Ameri-
can flag means that the
United States is a satellite
of the Soviet Union. But on
more serious terms, white is
a symbol of life. The arm-
bands are a protest against
death, the death of Vi'et-
namese and the death of
Americans. Even Mr. Stan-
ton would have to agree
that killing is wrong, no
matter what the rationali-
zation behind it.

As the war drags on, says
Mr. Stanton, the issues be-
come clearer. Obviously, he
declares, the South Vietna-
mese do not want Commun-
ism. Yet, in reality, this
statement cannot be proven.
In the recent “elections”
held by the Ky regime, Com-
munists were stricken from
the ballot. Does Mr. Stan-
ton call this freedom?

by Ivan Abrams

the issue of communism
versus God knows what has
become a quagmire of stu-
pidity. The reason behind
the civil war in the south is
not a question of ideologies
but a matter of independ-
ence, of nationalism, of
freedom from foreign, espe-
cially French and ‘Ameri-
ican, domination. The Viet
Cong are peasants fighting
for the right to be free.
Whatever the political lean-
ings of their leaders, free-
dom is the primary issue.

It cannot be denied that
the Viet Cong, do, indeed,
commit attrocities, but to
say that the actions of the
United States are miniscule
in comparison is ludicrous.
The Viet Cong systematical-
ly dispose of village lead-
ers"paid by the Saigon pup-
pet government; the Unit-
ed States disposes of vil-
lages loyal to the Viet Cong.
Perhaps Mr. Stanton had

best reconsider just which,‘

side in this" war is the mass
murderer.

Towards the end of his
column, Mr. Stanton sud-
denly side tracks from the
issue of Vietnam and at-
tacks the position of what
he likes to term “Doves” on
the June Arab-Israeli war.
The peace movement, both
at the University and
throughout the nation, is
made up not of robots, but
of the living, breathing,
thinking people, all mobil-
ized around the central is-
sue of opposi'tion to the war
in Vietnam. In no group
will the members agree on
all issues. The Mideast is

‘one of these points of dis-

agreement for some indi-_
viduals.

Students for Peace will
conti'nue to sponsor the
wearing of white armbands
on Wednesday. Mr. Douglas
Stanton may find them a
symbol of surrender, but
we prefer to think of them
as a symbol of determina-
tion, and life, as an indica-
tion that we ‘who wear them
will not remain complacent
vsahile the world is destroy-
e o ..

Student Raps
S.G. President

Editor, The Pitt News:

I am interested in Student
Government (SG) and would
like to take some active part in
it. I asked -a SG senator how I
could apply for one of the S-G
committees or projects which
are open to all -students. S-he
replied that these are rarely ap-
plied for; -they are usually ap-
pointed by the president.

Attending a recent SG meet-
ing to see if I could meet “The
Great Aup‘»pointer,” I realized
that positions are not just rele-
gated to a small clique but to
th-e same person. The same per-
son is executive alss'i~sta.nt to the
president, chief «co-ordinator of
the VISA project, chairman of
the Off-Calmtprus Housing Com-
mittee, head of the SG Book
Exchange ‘ Evaluation, and in
charge -of re-evaluating Fresh-
man Orientation. Maybe this per-
son is capable of doing ﬁve ma-
jor things at once (there are
probably more I don't know of).
But isn't this a little unfair, con-
sidering that «there are other
students like myself who would
like to participate in SG and
would prdbably prove just as
capable if given the chance?

Perhaps in this instance the
president is grooming .a succes-
sor, but he is doing it at the
cost‘ Olf student involvement.
Why weren’t these positions
printed in the Pitt News, re-
questing in~tere.sted students to
apply and interview? Instead we
read about them after the ap-
pointments have been made. I
think the president has lost
sight of the punpose of student
government —— to increase stu-'
dent involvement in University
life. I am amazed that the spine-
less senate could Sit back and
consent to this restrictive, self-
P91‘ Detuating hegemony.

‘News’ Coverage

Editor, The Pitt News:

..Having been a student at an-
other large un-ivensity doing my
undergraduate years, I had ac-
quired a long-standing disregard
for student newspapers, ﬁnding
most of them poorly written and
‘boorish.

Thus, it was with great reluc-
tance that I picked up my first
copy of The Pitt News. I must
say that I have been pleasantly
surprised. So far, in my few
short months here, I have had
no reason to change that ﬁrst
impression.

On the whole, I have found
the newspaper very well-writ
ten. Most of the columns are
well-Written and even in those
infrequent moments when the
-author loses his -grip of the E.ng-
lish language, the knowledge,
enthusiasm and vigor is enough
to make up for any grlamrnatical
mistakes.

The editorials have been very
good. There seems to be a great
understanding of the problems
of the University and the steps
advised seem‘ to‘be clear and
forthright. This is a trait that is
all to infrequent on coll-ege news-

papers today, many of Which"

seem -to -compete to see who can
be the most ﬂippant.

The sports page has also been
a pleasant surprise. The writing
seems way above average. Much
of it is good enough to appear
in any daily newspaper in the
country. I would also like to
compliment them on their use
of pictures, which adds greastly
to the attractiveness of the page.

I took the time «to write this
letter because I notice that praise
seems to -be an infrequent com-
modity in letters to the editor.
I think that a good job deserves
praise, and you have done a
good job.

Opponents of Vietnam War

Attempt to Disrupt Pentagon

by PHIL SEMAS

WASHINGTON (CPS) —~ 0.1)-
ponents of U.S. policy in Viet
nam protests and demonstra-
to are shifting their tactics from
actual attempts disrupt the war
effort.

The new tactics will be tested
on Oct. 21 when -thousands of
people will gather in Washing-
ton for a protest which, for
some of th-em, will include an at-

tempt to “sit down inside the “

Pentagon .an-d stop it from work-
ing.” , .
Dave Dellinger, chairman of
the National Mobilization to End
the War in Vietnam, -emphasizes
that there will be three parts
to the _October 21 demonstra-
tion: a march, a rally, and “an
opportunity for civil "disobedi-
ence.

He says the Mobilization is a
broadly based organization with
100 groups supporting it and
the Oct. 21 protest is intended

to provide ways of protest both .

for those who wish to march
and those who, in Del1inger’s
words, “want to do more than
dissent, who want to try to stop
the war.” .

Although in the past a few
people have employed such tac-
tics -a.-s lying down in front of
troop trains and refusing to
serve in the Army, mass dem-
onstrations, such as those or-
ganized by the Mobilization on
April 15 in San Francisco and
New York, have only included
marches and rallies with num-

erous spe-ake-rs. There has been
no direct action against the
war.

On Oct. 21 there will actually
be two marches, one from the
Lincoln Memorial and the other
from the Washington Monu-
ment. The two groups will con-
verge on the south parking lot
of the Pentagon, where there
will be a mass rally.

Jerry Rubin, the full time or-
ganizer of the -demonstration,
says if there are more than
200,000 -people, there may be
two or three rallies. No. one in
the Mobilization leadership has
any idea of how many people
will be coming. The group has
made arrangements for 1,000
‘buses to bring people down from
New York City to demonsctra-
tion, however.’

Mitrakos Moved In Shakeup

by ROY JACOBS
If it had been a clear day in Morgantown Saturday,
three varsity quarterbacks and six running backs would
have had an excellent chance to improve their suntans, be-
cause all of them spent the afternoon ﬂat on their backs looking

up at the sky.

They didn’t particularly want to be there, but since football

is basically a team sport they
didn’t have much choice. The
offensive line didn’t give them a
chance to choose othezrwise. And
the linemen know it, too.

“All of .us just aren’t getting
the job done,” said veteran line-
man Tom Mitrakos. “There
shakeup this

‘ “1“""‘-43-r\ (Vr\lVVI l’I

thing.”
The change has already been
made. .
‘M-itrakos started the season
and played the ﬁrst three games

TOM IVIITRAKOS
Returns to Center

as the offense’s tight tackle.

Last season he played center
and defensive end. His sopho-
more year, he was a linebacker.
But for Saturday’s game against
Wisconsin, he's been moved
back to center.

“There’s not too much differ-
ence between any offensive line
position,” explained Mitrakos.
“I’m happy w-here I am. Or if
they move me back. I'll play
wherever it’s best for the team.”

Hopefully, coach Dave Hart’s
lineup juggling will result in an
improved offense. A constantly
failing offense kept the varsity
out of a seemingly close 150
loss Saturday. Even today, it is
a hard fact for the team to ac-
cept.

“I couldn’t believe it was so
bad until I saw the ﬁlms,-” re-
marked Mitnakos. “Maybe a lot
of it was just mental mistakes.

‘They (West Virginia) impress A

 

 

ed me as high school kids. We’ll
never meet a‘ weaker team than
West Virginia.”

But ask Frank Gustine or Jeff
Barr if the Mountaineers seen“.-

ed like high school kids. They’re.

the ones who didn’t have time
to throw. Ask Mike Razklewicz.

‘”“'* ‘"3 fiii’. *.v-he eeeld ‘en-lv

gain eight yards on ﬁve carries.

“The running. trouble was a
combination of backs and the
line,” offered Tom. “We, had an
inexperienced tailback on Sat-
urday.

“I guess We aren’t holding the
blocks long enough,” he contin-
ued. “That must be some of the
problem. Possibly the backs
aren’t getting to the holes quick
enough.”

The pass’ protection wasn’t
too solid either.

“The blitz really hurt us,
Mitrakos elaborated. “They came
around end or over the middle.
Maybe we’reli1ot familiar with
the blitz. Saturday was the worst
it’s been all year.” As discour-
aging as Saturday was, all hope
is not lost.

“We still have seven games
left,” reminded Tom. “It’s just
a matter of ﬁnding out what’s
wrong and making the changes
to correct it.

“I’d really like to win three
games this season.

“The problem is a. combina-
tion of al the factors on the of-
fense,” he continued. “Inexperi-
ence is a big factor. I’ve never
played tackle before. AndI start-
ed as a sophomore and I know
what it’s like. I can't blame the
others at all.”

Despite the loss Saturday,
Mitrakos was told by the coach-
es he was doing a good job. It
didn’t matter as much to him as
ﬁguring out what the line was
doing wrong. This week he re-
turns to his old, familiar center
spot. Maybe that’ll help do the
trick.

Afterall, the best way to get

Cats Altered Again;

RaklewiczDemotecl 

by GEORGE LIES, Associate Sports Editor
N 0 Wonder Dave Hart has problems with the Panthers;

he is coaching at two schools.

Actually, a photograph of Hart (With a “t”) appears
in the Blue Book of Collegiate Athletics under Duke University
whose head football coach is Tom Harp (with a “p”). But Hart
doesn’t need the troubles of another team  he doesn’t

know to what to do with the one
he’s got.

Early this week, however, he
tried to ease his problems. He
made three major changes in
the Panthers’ sore spot, the 0-f-
fense.

Gary Cramer moved up to
ﬁrst team fullback; Mike Rakle-
wicz was demoted. Two lineman
were switched. Tom Mitrakos
moved from the tight tackle
position to the center spot ahead
of sophomore Dave Magyar.
Senior Frank Pecman, on the
reserve team since the start of
the season, moved to the tight
tackle post. With the addition of
the 6-4, 242 pound tackle, the
Panthers’ ﬁve man line now
averages 6-3, 222.

The changes resulted from the
embrarrasing loss to West Vir-
ginia last Saturday. A perform-
-ance Hart called his “worst foot-
ball game.”

Hart summed ‘up the game,
“Our offense, particularly our
lineman, did not extend them-
selves. They missed assignments;
they didn’t strike through any-
body; they missed blocks; and
they never once picked up-"'the
blitz,” he said.

“It was just a, complete men-
tal and physical breakdown of
our offensive line,” Hart said.

In minor adjustments, sopho-
mores George Richards and Joe
Laws came off the reserve team.
Richards moved to the left line-
backer position while Laws Went
into the right linebacker spot;
both on the second team. They
replaced soph Jeff Brown, who
was listed at each spot.

Defensively, despite giving up
700 net yards rushing in four
games, Hart stays with the same
team.

In the West Virginia loss, the
defense was on the ﬁeld for 89
plays, 40 minutes playing time.
Because of the ineffective of-
fense, the defense has had a.
rough time physically. In each

game, they’ve held for about

 

 

 

three quarters.

“,We made our defense extend
irtself, and this results in more
chances of breakdown,” pointed
out Hart. _,

Hart cited Lou Parrott, Dave
Drake, and Ed Whittaker for
their _defensive line play. “Drake
has played consistently and tre-
mendously all year and Whit-
taker played his best defensive.
game,” he said.

Against WVU, the defense re-
covered [three fumbles, that
amounts to six recoveries and
one pass interception in three
games.

But the defense always gets
blamed for those 30 point losses,
though they average 73 plays a
game to the offense’s 54.

Although a day off may have
helped the Panthers, Hart has
put them through short yardage
scrimmage drills .in two prac-
tices this week. We wants them
ready for Wisconsin,- Saturday.

Saturday’s game matches very
similar teams. Both are winless,
both have a poor offense, and

both feel this game will be their ‘

ﬁrst Win.

-’I‘~he_B’adgers are having trou-
ble with first year men as are
the Jungle Cats. The oppon-
ent’s biggest threat is quarter
back J ohm Ryan, “one we must
stop,” said Hart.

Ryian prefers to run; “he's a
scrambler,” notes coach Stan
Zajdel who scouted Wisconsin.
As a passer, Ryan isn’t bad.
Last year he completed 43 of
98 attempts, with an 11 yard
passing avenage.

His main receiver Tom Mc
Cauley, who caught 46 passes in
1966 for three touchdowns.

“They're a much better foot-V,

ball team than we are even
though they are winless,” I-Iart
said.

In two previous encounters,
the Cats have Won twice. In
1937, the score was 21-0; in 1938,
it was 26-6.

. . . BUT PRIBISH was immediately snowed under by a. host of
blue-shirted Mountaineers. He finished with only 20 {yards In nine
carries, but Dave Hart still has high hopes for his sophomore tail-

back. “We just. 0011101).’ »get him out in the open,’’ Hart  .

Len Harmon: ‘Spirit on This

Team Greatest Thing Ever’

. ‘ by MIKE BROURMAN
Four times this year Len Harmon has
left the ﬁeld with head bowed. He doesn’t
intend to let itlhappen again.

Len is the goalie of the soccer team. The
booters have -an 0-3-1 record so far this year, cer-
tainly no morale booster. But, according to Len,
the spirit is high, and the team still has high
hopes for -a winning season.

Len has '-been on Winning soccer teams. He
played high school’ ball at Monongahela which-
was a VVPIAL powerhouse. As a freshman here
he saw the soccer team compile a 7-1-1 record.

77 Still, he states bluntly that this team, despite its

record has the ‘best attitude of them all.
“As far as spirit and general attitude, this
team is tremendous,” he says. “It’s the greatest

. thing I’ve experienced yet. This is the most spir-

ited team I’ve ever played on.” , A .
Last year, -the soccer team was a povwe-rhouse

-on paper. They- never played up to their poten-

tial. The team lost ‘two early games and then, as

’ Harmons says,. were “ripped apart by dissension.”

I-Ie vows that it won’t happen again.

“The big difference thispyear is teamwork and
hustle. We’re really a team. Last year we had
tremendous material, but some players just quit.

@This year, we’ve gone down ﬁghting.

“I’m disappointed in some of the scores so

it far, of course. I thought we’d win at least two

of the four games. But, we have a real good shot

at the last seven.” '

Thus far, the team has been -hurt by a lack
of scoring punch, and Len believes that a better
offense is the key to future success. “The whole
thing depends on our scoring. I think we showed
some signs of improvement last week. If the
defense continues to play as it has, and if the
offense can get a couple of goals we’ll win our
share.

‘‘It’s not that the offense isn’t trying. T-hey’re
putting out 100 per ‘cent. Their luck has to
change sometime. It can’t go on like this all
year.”

iBefore the season began, there* was some
doubt as to ‘the capability of the defense. All
three of last year’s fullback-s were gone. But Len
has nothing but praise for their replacements.

“Joe Kruth has been unbelievable in the mid-
dle. He’s the best center fullback I’ve ever play-
ed with. Mike Sch-alk is tremendously improved;
Norm Roux has done a great job for a sopho-
more.” _ I
I Harmon mentions his own play when press-
ed. “I thank God that I’Ve ‘been able to’ play the
way I have. I was ho-ping to do well. I’ve improv-
ed but I still have a lot to work on.” The statis-
tics speak somewhat differently, In four games
he -has allowed only ﬁve goals.

With a little -help from the offense, with con-
tinued good play on defense, and with Len Har-
mo-n in goal, suddenly seven in a row doesn’t
seem so far away after all.

Tough Luck
‘Hawk’ Falls,

For the “Hawk,” -glory lasted
only a week. That was how long
it took -him to plummet out of
the lead in -the Yogi covntest. And,
with the “Hawk” shot down (a
frequent occutrance), the race
suddenly become -tighrte-r than
one of Brigitte Bardot’s sweat-
ers. _

“I clipped the Hawk’s tail fea-
thers,” boasted George “Mousta-
chio” Lies to all of those unfor-
tunate enough to cross his path.
The “Moustachio” jumped into
a ﬁrst place tie with the coach-
es, one game ahead of the
“Hawk” and Linda “Beulah-”
Goldstein. Bill Lewis, picking
for the Coaches used his choice
of Duke over Army to come up
with a \10-5 mark, the week’s
best slate. , I P

Paul Killian (Players) and
Maida Gekoski (Girls) used

 
      

Coaches Soar

Navy and Indiana, respectively,
to ﬁnish with 9-6 marks, thus
leaving six of the Yo-gis within
three games of each other.
Where was the seventh? For
Jay “Flatbush” Rosenstein it
was another in a long string of
disasters. His 8-7 card still left
him below the .500 mark, and
wavering on the bring of elimin-
ation. In his frustration,. it is
rumored that “Flatbush” has
-gone so far‘ as to contact Fred
“Blood ‘n’ Guts” Frank for help.
- But “Bang,” last year's winner,
is remaining in obscurity, which
is his rightful home.

As for the “H»awk,” he Was,

fluctuating between pity and sui-
cide all weekend. “It’-s not so
much, my 7-8 .mark,’’ he cried,
‘‘it’s being tied  the “Big
Wind” that lbothevrs me. Oh! The
sorrow of it all.”

- Dorms Vie for Championship Today;
Three Remain In Each Frat League

by ED CONLEY
Three teams remain in contention in each league as
fraternity softball enters its ﬁnal week of action. In League
“A,” the survivors are Zeta Beta Tau, Pi Lambda Phi, and Phi
Epsilon Pi. The leaders in League “B” are Sigma Alpha Epsilon,

Sutherland
Playboys, In
Title Tilt

by CHARLES DWORAK

Sutherland defeated Mad
House twice Monday to cap-

&— ture the Tower B champion-

  

ship in the se-mi-ﬁnal round of
the Dorm League softball tour-
nament. They will tangle with
Playboy’s Penthouse, the Tow-
er A champions, today for the
dorm championship.

Sutherland, which went into
the semi-ﬁnal round with one
loss had to be-at undefeated Mad
House twice to get in.to the ﬁ-
als. Mad House forfeited the
regularly scheduled game. Sev-
eral more players showed up
for Mad House after the for-
feit, however, which enabled
them to play the second game.

George Deeb scattered ﬁve
hits in pitching ‘Sutherland to a
5-2 win-. Sutherland «scored a
run in the third inning, -and the
Madmen countered an inning
later with their only runs on .'-I.
triple by Don Lombaar-do. In the
bottom half of the same inning,
Bob Ceci and Don Katz homer-
ed as Sutherland scored four
times to ice the victory.

The Playboys earned a spot
in the ﬁnals last VVednesday by
beating Random, 8-1. Seymour
Adler pitched a ﬁve-hitter and
shutout Random over the last
six innings. I

The Playboys scored in the
ﬁrst and Random tied the score
in the same inning on a single
by Dennis Courson, an error,
and a sacriﬁce ﬂy by Walt Bie‘.-
eski. The -Playboys then scored
twice in the third and ﬁve times
in the fourth to break the game.
John Dragan had three -hits and
scored three runs, and Jim 11-
lion ‘had two hits and scored
twice for the Playboys.

In the other game played last
Wednesday, Sutherland entered
the semi-ﬁnals by downing Litch-
ﬁeld, 16-7. Sutherland scored six
runs in the ﬁrst inning and
coasted from there. George
Deeb led the 21-hit attack against
Litchﬁeld with four hits in ﬁve
trips, including «a ﬁrst-inning
three-run homer. Tom Bare also
homered in the ﬁrst for Suth-
erland.

Other hitting stars included
Steve Ellisor, who had four hits
and scored twice, and winning
pitcher Don Katz, who had three
hits and scored three runs. Den-
nis Cook had two hits and
scored twice for Litchﬁeld, and
losing pitcher Bill Dempler had
three hits.

8 Seek First

Hopeful of gaining their ﬁrst
victory of the season, the soccer
team is preparing to meet Slip-
pery Rock at Forbes Field this
Saturday.

Thus far, the booters have
dropped three games and tied
one. But if their injury list
dwindles a little, they stand a
chance against the Rockets.

‘At the present time, two of
the starting fullbacks, Joe Kruth
and Norm Roux, and halfback
Bob Quinlin are sidelined with
minor injuries. All are expected
to play =-Saturday. Last year in
a game marked by rough play,
Slippery Rock defeated the soc-
cer team, 3-2, by scoring three

fourth quarter goals.
$ * 3

The cross-country tea.m de-
feated Gannon Friday, 20-35, for
their fourth win against one
loss this season. Paul Greig cap-
tured his fourth ﬁrst place in a
time of 22:37 over the Sch-enley
Park course. Harriers Paul Zink,
Ken Lawton, and Jay Jensen ﬁn-
ished ‘right behind ‘Greig.

The Panther Club has an-
nounced its officers for the year,
They are: Terry Hoover (wrest-
ling -football) president; Pete
Smith (baskertball), Vice-pre~si-
dent; Dave Shidecmantle (gym-
nastics), secretary; and Joe Cur-
tin (football), treasurer.

Members of (the committee
are: Bob Racunas (golf), Ken
Bollens (basketball), John Lane

(swimming), Dave Drake (foot-;

ball), Paul Greig (track), Blain-e
Popp (soccer), George McKen-
zie (baseball), and Ken Cooke
(baseball).

Pi Kappa Alpha, and Kappa
Sigma.

ZBT earned its position by
ousting Sigma Chi last week in
“A” action. Jay Rosenstein’s
ﬁve-hitter led the winners to
their 4-3 decision. He retired the
ﬁrst 14 batters in outdueling

Dave Wiersma, the Sig Chi
pitcher
Steve Mirkin led ZBT with

two RBI’s and Jeff Heimberg
drove in the winning run with
a double in the last half of the
seventh inning.

Steve Rosenbaum’s two-hit
shut-out victory over Phi Ep
put Pi Lam into the comfort-
able position of waiting to meet
the ZBT-Phi Ep winner for the
“A” championship. Bob Black
hurled a ﬁve-hitter for Phi Ep
in losing, 2-0. The only runs
given up by.Black came in the
ﬁfth inning when Billy Siegal
rapped a pinch-hit single with
two men on base. '

In League “B,” Kappa Sig
kept alive with a .12-4 trouncing
of Theta Chi. John Briston hit
a. home run and Bill Greene
went two-for-three in leading
Kappa Sig to the victory. Larry
Lezniak was the winning pitch-
er.

Failure to hit in the clutch,
and poor ﬁelding contributed to
Theta C»hi’s downfall.

Finally, PiKa earned a berth
in the ﬁnals by smashing a
loose-ﬁelding SAE team, 14-0.
Bob Pacha, the PiKa pitcher,
threw a ﬁve-hitter in gaining
the victory. Bill Nichols hit a.
home run, as the winners scored
in all but one inning.

The losers, SAE, will face
Kappa Sig in a game to deter-
mine PriKa’s opponent in the
“B” championship game.

Freshman basketball tryouts
will be held Sunday, Oct. 15,
and Monday, Oct. 16, at Trees
Hall, according to frosh coach
Tim Grgurich. Any freshman
interested in trying out should
contact Grgurich at 683-2800,
ext. 236, for further details.
Freshman managers are also
needed. Possible applicants can
reach Grgurich at the same
number.
