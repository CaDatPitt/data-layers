UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

By Lou Grieco
Senior Staff Writer

Howard L. Ross, regional direc-
tor of the Anti-Defamation

League of B’nai B’rith, warned

area campus. police last Friday to
watch for white supremacist ac-
tivities on campus, because hate
groups are increasingly trying to
recruit young adults.

Speaking to representatives of
Pitt, Carnegie Mellon and Du-

quesne campus police forces at a

seminar on ethnic intimidation
law, Ross also told the officers
that Pittsburgh is especially_sus-
ceptible to hate groups because

of the economic hardships the

area. has faced. V

Debaters finish in nation's top 10

By Tim Fitzgerald
For The Pitt News .

The Pitt debate team consisting
of senior Carl Craver and sopho-
more Jarle Crocker ranked in the

' top 10 teams in the country in the

National Debate Tournament.

The debate was held for the last
two weeks at James Madison
University in Virginia. Craver and
Crocker made it to the final 16 in
the elimination bracket. The sec-
ond team of sophomores, Frank
Bender and Holly Johnston, held
on until the last of eight debates
before losing in the first round.

Previously, Craver and Crock-
er were ranked ninth in the coun-
try by the National Coaches
Committee. These rankings,
however, were not announced
until the end of the tournament

”The steel mills went down,
unemployment went up, and

‘ frustrations went'up,” Ross said.

”They‘re telling these kids that
the reason their parents are un-
employed is that the Jews are tak-
ingjover the country.”

According to Ross, local signs
of white supremacists include:

0 The Populist Party national
headquarters is in Pittsburgh. In
1988, former Klansman David
Duke, who recently was elected.
to the Louisiana state legislature,
ran as the Populist presidential
candidate. ‘

0 The Electric Banana,'a night-
club in North Oakland, has been
the hangout for fascist ”skin-
heads” for the past six months.

so as not to affect the compe-
tition.

In addition to team competi-

tion, judges at _the tournament

recognized individual debaters’

by awarding them points on a
scale from one to 30. Craver was
ranked as _the 12th-best speaker
in the country, with -more than
600 points.

Debate team coach Cori
Dauber is very pleased with the
Pitt squad’s performance:
”There’s no question that the four
students that competed are ex-
tremely talented and very deserv-
ing, but this was a squad effort
with many students putting in
substantial effort even after their
competitionhad ended.”

During the tournament, teams
debated against eight? of the 74

teams entered, and had to win ‘at

Neither the owners of the Elec-
tric Banana, nor Dan Waffell,
leader of the Populist Party
(which operates out of a post
office box) was available for

_ comment.

Ross said that though’! the num-

bers of people in the various hate 1

groups are small, the groups are
usually comprised of the most
radical elements. Because of this,

it to the finals. Bender and John-
ston were down three debates
when going into_the final, "or

”Their final debate was do-or-

mores, that was very exciting,”
said Dauber. '

The top 32 teams were then
picked to continue debating In
the tourna_ment. In order to ad-
vance to higher brackets, .teams
had to win each successive

Dauber said that a lot of the
other coaches at the tournament
were congratulating the Pitt
squad, but were not pleased to
find that three of the four team
members were sophomores.

 

VOLUME EIGHTY-THREE, ISSUE



Pro-choicers to rally 

in Washington, D. C.

By Brendan Kevenides
Senior Staff Writer i

At least 100 Pitt students will
join representatives from 400 col-
leges and universities from
around the country on Sunday in
a pro-choice abortion rally in
Washington, D.C. '

The rally will probably be the
largest of its kind in U.S. history,
according to Jeanne Clark, na-
tional chairwoman for reproduc-
tive rights for the National
Organization for Women. 0

These 400 schools will make
up about one-third of all of the
people expected to participate in
the rally, Clark added.

The Pitt group will be part of a
group numbering almost 1,000
from the Pittsburgh area. I

The group from Pitt will be

representing four campus organi-‘
* zations: Tlie Campusgwomen-'5
Organization, the College Young »

Democrats, the New Student
Network for Creative Social
Change and the Women's Law
Caucus. _

The marchers will be profess-

ing their outrage at the Supreme

Court's decision to hear Webster
vs. Reproductive Health Services
at the end of this month. The
Supreme Court's decision could
overturn the "1 973 case of Roe vs.
Wade which made abortion
legal.
A dec_ision in the case is ex-
pected by the end of June.
According to Stacy Finke of the
Campus Women's Organization,
college students have a large
stake in the court's decision.
”This is a big issue for our
generation. We're the ones who
are going to be affected the most
by new abortion laws,” she said.
3 ‘Also, our rights to some types of
birth control could be taken away
if Roe vs. Wade is overturned."
When asked why she thinks so
many college students will partic-

ipate in the rally, Clark said, ’’It.

is a false assessment that most
college students are conservative.
I speak at a lot of colleges, and
many students are strongly for
abortion rights.”

In response to vocal anti-
abortion protests by groups such

as Operation Rescue, the march-
ers on Sunday wish to show the
U.S. government that they
represent

Americans.

"Abortion is not a controversial 0

issue," Clark said. ’’In the polls
I've looked at, the majority of
people in this country support le-
gal abortions.” —

Finke said that Operation Res-
cue has lost sight of their cause.

”They’re supposed to be pro-"
life, yet they're bombing abortion V

clinics,” she said. .
The rally will begin Sunday

morning as participants assemble.

in the Washington Monument
area of the Mall. Entertainment

will be provided by musical"
groups such as Peter, Pauland  

Mary. , -

Participants are encouraged ‘to
,wear white.
- - From there, the march 
move down Constitution Avenue ’ -1-
to the Supreme "Court building.‘ ‘7

”We want to make a statement

to the court to keep their hands » *

off abortion rights,” Clark said.

At that point, Clark said, there’ 

will be an announcement that the

march is over and the crowd - 
should disperse and proceed to 
the west side of the Capitol

Building.

She explained’ that the an-
nouncement is simply a forrnali-r s
ty required because it is illegal to" 
formally surround the Capitol

‘Building.

At the Capitol, there will be 
speeches by national celebrities

and more entertainment.‘

. When asked to predict the at-‘
mosphere at the rally, Finke said,
”lt’s going to be positive. _'l'.he’_J

energy will be incredible.” ‘

When local groups rallied for 
abortion rights in Pittsburgh .on -‘

Jan. 22, a small but vocal group

of anti-protesters showed up. Pro- 
life groups are not expected to be ‘A 

a problem on Sunday.

”The last time pro-choieé-";
groups staged a rally in Washing-;y_
ton, in 1986, there was only ‘av '
small group of anti-protesters‘;-~.«
present,” Finke said. ”Also, pro- 7
life groups held their own rally_in' *

‘Washington on Jan. 23.”

PHILADELPHIA (AP) ~ Euro-
pean nations’ efforts to build the
world's largest trading bloc by
1992 offers new challenges and
opportunities, General Motors
Chairman Roger Smith said
yesterday. ’

”The dream is to create a new
free market — a third capitalist
power, bigger in population than
either the United States or Japan
‘— and in economic power, cer-
tainly the equal of either one,”
Smith said in a speech to the
World Affairs Council of
Philadelphia.

A united European market will
also present new challenges to
Japanese automakers, one they
are already moving to meet, the
head of the No.1 American car
manufacturer said.

The drive by the 12 member
nations of the European Commu-
nity to abolish barriers to trade
and movement among them-
selves is in some ways similar to
the American move, 200 years
ago, to establish a national mar-
ket, Smith said.

If it succeeds, he said, ”the
dream _i_s.t_o_imp_£ove _the ljving

standards of some 320 million
people by stimulating enterprise,
innovation and, of course, trade.”

Smith told the civic and educa-
tional group that the program,
known as EC92, should benefit
the United States, too.

”The EC is our largest trading
partner, and we think economic
integration will strengthen Europe
and create new opportunities for
U.S. companies — provided 
that EC-wide standards don't dis-
criminate against American
products or firms.

Bush to fill openings
with Pennsylvanians

WASHINGTON (AP) - The
Bush administration plans to fill
its remaining major transporta-
tion openings by naming a pair
of Pennsylvanians to head the
Federal Highway Administration
and the Urban Mass Transit Ad-
ministration, officials said

yesterday.

The White House has told the
Department of Transportation
and lawmakers that it intends to
appoint Thomas Larson, 60, who
was secretary of the Pennsylvania
Department of Transportation un-
der former Gov. Dick Thorn-
burgh, to be administrator of the
FHWA, according to department
and congressional sources.

Meanwhile, the White House
has told the same lawmakers and
DOT officials that Brian Clymer,
vice chairman of the
Southeastern Pennsylvania Trans-
portation Authority, will be
named to head UMTA.

Benedict tries again
for shorter sentence

WILLIAMSPORT, Pa. (AP) -
Former state Auditor General -Al
Benedict is making another at-
tempt for a shorter sentence in a
case involving public corruption
and job-selling schemes.

Benedict, who has been in the
federal prison in Loretto for a
year, claims in a motion filed in
federal court that his sentence of
six years in jail and a $20,000
fine is illegal.

The former auditor general
claims other participants in the
scheme who did more than he
did received lesser sentences.

As an example, he pointed out
John Kerr, his top aide, was con-
victed in state court on 139 felo-
ny counts and received a 2-to-5
year prison term and no fine.

lence and must be watched, es-
pecially on campus.

”University kids today are
stressed out,” he said. ”They’re
in a dog-eat-dog world, and they
are potential prey.”

Ross’ speech was part of a day-
long seminar that addressed
many different sides of hate-crime
issues. Moderator Robert A.
Clough of the Pennsylvania Hu-
man Relations Commission ex-
plained the laws concerning
ethnic imtimidation.

”Crimes of hatred have to be
dealt with because of the traumat-
ic effect on the community,”
Clough said. ”The key is to show
the community that no one, no
matter how many supporters he
has, is above the law.’’

According to state law, a crime
is considered ”ethnic intimida-
tion” if itis committed with ”ma-
licious intentions towards the
race, color, religion or national
origin of another individual or
group of individuals.” Under the
law, the seriousness of the crime
increases if it involves ethnic in-
timidation. Therefore, a crime
that is usually considered a
misdemeanor will be considered
a felony.

’’It is important that you know

and understand this law,” Clough
told the officers. ’’If my son is
black and yours is white and they
get into a fight over chewing
gum, that is not ethnic intimida-
tion. By misusing this law, you
will undermine it.”

Clough also warned the officers
not to apply he law in crimes
against homosexuals, because
they do not fall under the four
classifications of "race, color,
religion, or national origin.”
Therefore, an assault against a
homosexual can only be classi-
fied as an assault.

Clough, a large black man,
often made racially offensive
comments to emphasize "the im-
portance of the issue to the
officers. He gave examples such
as ’’I hate the lrish” and ”Blacks
are whats wrong with this
country.”

Another speaker was Maj. Ben-
jamin Brooks of the Pennsylvania
State Police Affirmative Office.
Brooks stressed the relationship
between affirmative action pro-
grams and ethnic intimidation.

”Affirmative action programs
were started to give qualified
minorities an equal chance at em-
ployment. Many people claim
that the program was designed so

THE PITT NEWS

I am a concerned member of
society — concerned that every
life be held sacred, that every one
of us be treated with equality, that
no one person's life be deemed
more or less worthy than
another’s.

Unlike the majority of Ameri-
cans, I feel that capital punish-
ment does not reflect these
concerns; it threatens society. It
lessens the value of human life
every time a human life is will-
fully taken by means of an exe-
cution. ‘

Does the execution of a crimi-
nal solve any problems for soci-
ety? The answer is an emphatic
no. It only serves to worsen the
tragedy of the loss of one life with
the taking of another. Proponents
of the death penalty claim it is’
useful in deterring crime, more
specifically, murder. However,
capital punishment has never
proven to be a successful deter-
rent to crime. Crime will always
be an unfortunate fact of life for
us, as long as we are ruled by a
government that caters to the
wealthy and neglects the poor.

Proponents of the death

penalty also claim that those an-
gered by the crime ”need’,’ -to
have the criminal executed in
order that they may feel relief in
knowing that the murder has
been avenged. We are all deeply
saddened and angered by the loss
of a life, and our sorrow and
anger is amplified when the life
is taken at the hands of a fellow
citizen — rightly labeled a'crimi-
nal. There is absolutely nothing
wrong with feeling anger. But,
from this anger stems a so—called
”need” or desire for revenge.
There is something terribly wrong
about revenge when it necessi-
tates the taking of another life. If
we are to be considered a ”civi-
lized” and moral people, then we
must not allow our psychologi-
cal, irrational need for revenge to
overwhelm our sense ofmorality.

We all want a criminal to be
punished for his act of violence.
However, taking his life is not a
form of punishment —— it is an act
of self-satisfaction. A vast majority
of Americans feels that the crimi-
nal deserves to die, and feels
satisfied that he has-been justly
punished when the execution

takes place. They are actually
pleased to see a human life end.
This is not a healthy (dare I say
sane) attitude. If we truly respect
all human life and hold each life
sacred, then how can we justify
the willful taking of a crimina|’s
life —— aren't they human, too?
People are not born with the
natural instinct to kill. There are
external factors which drive a
person to violence. One who
commits murder is usually under
the influence of drugs, emotion-
ally aroused to a fit of violence,
or mentally ill. Any of these fac-
tors may be responsible for-the
person's uncontrollable and irra-
tional behavior. A healthy, sane
individual does not commit an
act of violence without mitigating
circumstances. I do not mean to
imply that the murder should be
taken lightly; the criminal should
be punished for his crime.
However, keeping the mental
condition of these ' people in
mind, we must also realize that
they are in desperate need of
help. They need professional
care, time and patience to help
them recover. They at least
deserve the chance to become a

There is no problem with the
death penalty.

The problem is with the way
that it is being used. Right now,
the penalty is not a deterrent to
criminals because the pansies in
the justice system don't have the
wherewithal to enforce it.

With the way the system works
now, someone could go out and
kill another person who is just
walking down the street. The
killer could then wait around and
kill another person, or he could
take a tour across America, leav-
ing a trail of deadbodies behind
him.

Then, when this killer is final-
ly caught, he can go through a
long trial, and if found guilty, he
can appeal. If he loses the appeal,
he can file for another one. This
could go on forever until he final-
ly is denied an appeal, or dies of
old age.

If somebody kills in cold blood
(besides during war, of course),
he should be killed. It is as sim-
ple as that. This would success-

doesn't seem to know either. It
defines womanizing as ”to pur-

no respect for anybody. For ex-
ample, if a guy-in my office takes

Bob Hefty spoke up, ”The
whole business of courting is full

so far my mother hasn't liked any

I replied, ”People believe that

if a man has to go from woman

Bob protested, ”But if a man's

wrong with going out with a lot

1 Those against the death penalty
say that taking the killer's life will
not bring back his‘. victim or vic-
tims.- Given that this is obviously
true, answer this question:
What if a friend, maybe even
a relative, of yours was one of the
36 women that Ted Bundy bru-
tally murdered, or one of the four
that Gary‘ Heidnick kept locked
and chained in his basement be-
fore killing them and eating them,
or one of the 25 that John Wayne
Gacy killed, or one of the 12 that
David Berkowitz gunned down
on the streets of New York?
You would want the killer to
pay‘ for his crimes. Not just life in
prison. Give him death. These
people don't deserve to live. Liv-

ing would be a victory for these.

"I deal with it on a case-by-case

whole, sane person again. Grant-
ed, the victims of murder do not
get that chance. But killing the
murderer doesn't bring the dead
back to life. It does bring the toll
of unfortunate and unnecessary
deaths to two.

LYNN ULLMAN

As moral people, we know that
the taking of a life by a murderer
is wrong. But we are led to be-
lieve that the taking of a life by
the government, an execution, is
acceptable because it somehow
makes up for the first death. It
doesn't take a genius in arithmet-
ic to see that one plus one equals
two, not zero. The death of one
does not cancel outithe death of
another. ‘

Don't we call ourselves _ -a
”democratic” society, advanced
far beyond the societies of the rest

-of the world? Don't we claim to
be a civilized community where
human rights (including the right
to.live) and freedom prevail? We
are willing to threaten, and some-
times enact, war against dictator-
ships and communist societies

unforgivable action?

was very much against it and said
that I was sick for supporting
”|ega|ized murder.”

I then told her of the things that
Bundy did. ”Let'him fry,” was the
answer I received.

Right now there are over 2,000
convicted killers sitting on death
row across the United States.

Why?

Each one of them is acting as
a role model for some other sicko
out there.‘

Recently‘, the Supreme Court
heard arguments for and against
setting an age limit for the death
penalty. Right now, in most
states, anyone under the age of
18 can't be executed. Thankful-
ly, Pennsylvania .is not one of

these states.
, One case being argued is that
of Keven Stanford. At the age of
17, Stanford raped and murdered
a girlwhile robbing a gas station
in Louisville, Ky. '

The other case is Heath Wil-

I then asked Arthur Bucking-
ham, the lobbyist, ”Do certain
professions have more womaniz-
ers than others?”. .

"Of course they do. Defense
consultants are in a very high
stress business and womanizing
is the only way. they can wind
down.” ,

Roz Ripple th_ought that
womanizers should be hung.

”They serve no useful purpose,
and they're always spoiling your
fun on a Saturday night'.’-''

’’It sounds as if you're bitter be-
cause there are no messages on
your answering machine,” l_said.

’’I can get all the womanizer '

dates I, want. But I wouldn't waste
my time with a man who is inter-
ested in going to a movie with me '
one night and validating his park-
ing ticket with someone else the
next.” . .

WHAT WE ARE

  PIeasureHeads

byJoeITimuIak

Things are definitely looking
up for the‘PIeasure Heads. Since
songwriting guitarists Patty Pisu-
Ia and Debbie Cantazaro met
two years ago, they've been
held back by a constant stream
of drummers coming and going
and the lack of national recog-
nition of Pittsburgh. They've now
solidified with the rhythm section
of Smith Harper Hutchings (bass)
s

who've played in ban

together for years.

The solid lineup has let the duo
concentrate on progression.
They've had as much local ra-
dio success as a Pittsuburgh
band could have had in I988
with their four-track cassette and
their November single, "Song
For God/Clove Cigarettes." But
their new songs are going be-
yond their garage-rock roots
toward some more adventurous
arrangements. With a ton of
great music in the backs of their
heads, the Pleasure Heads are
pulling themselves up to the lev-
el of labelmates the Cynics and
the Heretics. But when will the
world take notice?

11': Your name .came from a
Birthday Party song, but your
music has a simpler continuity, a
more straightforward approach
than theirs. Can you detail any
ways that the Birthday Party has
inspired or influenced your ap-
proach or lyrics?

Patty Pisula: That's prob-
ably more me. Their music was
inspirational to me in the tension
factor. And though my songs
aren't so tense, they're really af-
fected by the style and structure
of Birthday Party son s. And a
big reason the style ogour early
songs wasn't so affected by their
songs was simply that I wasn't
as accomplished as Roland
Howard. But I've been listening
very carefully, and I've tried to
assume a little of his flavor in one
of my new songs.

1'': 50 their records are still
pretty inspirational to you?

PP: Oh yeah, but something
I happen to be listening to more
right now is the D.C. nouveau
punk stuff: Fu azi, G.|., Fire-
party, who wegl be playing with
next month. They brought punk
out of the very narrow
parameters that it has been in for
a long time. They've shown
people that it doesn't have to be
fast and completely unintelligible
and completely arrogant. It
could be appealing and affect-

ing. It can rock and have a melo- .

dy and a sense of purpose.

11': Do you think that there is
any important change in the lyr-
ics, and if so, is it a significant
one? .

PP: Yeah, I think that the
whole scene is growing up.
They're looking at some other
problems, some other issues in
life, more long—term kinds of
things.

11': At the Sonic Temple
opening, you played "Black

Hebrew" for the ﬁrst time. lt
seemed to show a big break-
through in arrangements for your
music, and it worked very well

live. Does this signify a news

direction in your songwriting?

Deb Cantazaro: I would

say so. I think the few new songs
we've written are a lot ‘different
than our old songs, and I hope
that's the direction we're going
in.
PP: Yeah, we're becoming a
lot more focused. We've had a
solid lineup for several months
now, which is something new for
us, and instead of teaching
someone old songs, we've been
able to hone our skills to develop
our new songs. I think all our
tastes are being unified into one
direction.

DC: Yeah, we're adding a
whole lot of everything. "Black
Hebrew" is a good example
because I tend to write in minor
keys and Patty tends to write in
major; and in the song it sounds
very minor-keyed, but the cho-
rus breaks in with this huge
major—keyed rock 'n' roll sound.
Now we're just combining
everything.

PP: Deb writes in very
ethereal, Mid—Eastern melodies
and intervals, and when I have
just some basic power-chords, it
makes for some interesting
songs. The whole thing is based
on trust. You have to trust your
abilities and the other people in
the band to interpret them well.

DC: I think we're a very giv-
ing band. Aside from some small
problems, we've always been
willing to try anything. I guess
we're willing to play with things
rather than just ditching them
right off.

J1’: Do you think these things
are a result of you two being
together for two years, or the
fact that the lineup is finally
solid?

PP: l'm sure it's a combina-
tion of both. I can't imagine how
far ahead we'd be if we'd all
been together for this amount of
time. A lot of it has to do with
Michael Quinlin joining the
band.

DC: Yeah, he's wonderful.

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, April 6, I989

Michael and Smith are really in-

credible together.

PP: Yeah, that's what made
Smith feel really comfortable
since they've worked together
all their lives. Michael was in the
Cynics for a while, and when he
came over to our band it really
solidified the lineup. Michael
and Smith have this rhythm sec-
tion down; it's just a fine art, I've
never seen anything like it be-
fore. And they really respect
what we do. It seems like it might
be difficult for a guy to sit down
and have to...

DC: Patty and I write most of
the songs, so it might be hard for
a guy to sit down and say, "OK,
l'm going to play this woman's
song." It's not necessarily hard,
but it's different. E

PP: It's not the standard
procedure in rock 'n' roll, but it's
so healthy that it works out. I
was worried about it, but it's
never been a problem.

JT: What are your thoughts
about the recent impact made
on independent/underground
music by women? l 'm thinking of
the Pixies, Fourwaycross,
Scrawl, Throwing Muses, Salem
66: women being part of a
group with or without men,
rather than overtly saying, like
Joan Jett, "l'm a chick doing a
man's /ob. "

PP: Well, we're not doing
a man's job; we're doing a

women's job. You mentioned _
Scrawl; I hate to ever fail to

mention that they were very in-
spirational forlmy wanting to
play. They were writing songs
aboutthings that happen all the
time in interpersonal relation-
ships all the time, but from a truly
female point of view. And they

4 don't alienate men. I could re-

late to them so clearly. We're
not overtly feminist writers, but
we are independent individuals.

DC: The thing I like about,the
underground bands is that there
is no segregation of men and
women. These things don't mat-

ter; they're all doing the same '

things in the group. All female
bands are great, but when they
push the limit, they're worse
than a macho band.

PP: Overkill is just as bad.

JT: Not to pigeon hole, the
Pleasure Heads and thereby ig-
nore your writing and perform-
ing potential, but you cover 0
Tell Tale Hearts’ song. To what
extent are you do you draw in-
spiration from garage-psych
music? T

PP: l'm a very big garage
fan, though I seem to be draw-
ing away from it now. I love the
simplicity and the rhythms. They
kind of tug at your soul; I know
why the Watusi was invented!

DC: That was the first song
we ever learned together.

PP: It's especially inspiration— '

al when you're just learning how
to play because it's simple, like

    
    

    

,' Brickell. .

the Sex Pistols, who influenced
a lot of people in the same way.
Anybody was able to do it.

11': When punk exploded, on
entire generation of kids disco-
vered the fun'of playing live with
a band. This, of course, can-
tinues today, but Pittsbur h
seems different. Do you think 0-
cal bands have fun or that the
kids who go to shows think it
would be fun to be in a band?

DC: Yeah, I think the kids
watching definitely think it would
be fun because that's how I al-
ways saw it. Ever since I started
going to shows, I've been in-
spired to pIay‘more. It was a
great incentive to keep with it,
even though I've been playing
guitar since I was fifteen.

J'I': How do you, as cons-
tants of the local musiccircuit,
rate the quality of Pittsburgh's
bands?

PP: It's like anywhere else.
There are some incredible bands
and some really sh—tty.band_s.
Now there's a big blowout in
Seattle; it's being called the new
Athens and the new Minneapo-

lis. The scene is incredible, and I

they're really showcasing their
bands. But what happened to
Pittsburgh? When's it going to

. happen here? There's a big var-

iety of great bands here, and l'm
very confident about the level of
outstanding musicianship here.
Maybe in some college in Iowa
people look at the Pittsburgh
scene like we see Seattle and
we just haven't gotten any feed-
back yet. It just seems odd that
there is so much quality here that
doesn't go very far.

J1’: /t was probably like that
in Seattle for a while before it

‘broke.
PP: And now we're finally 
hearing about it. So what hap— 

pened? Somebody tell me. They
have Sup Pop and Poplama.
We have Get Hip and some
very independent labels putting
out a lot of quality records.
There -should be clamoring go-

‘ ing on, some articles in Spinjwith

goofy captions.

11': l 'm glad you have a good
attitude about it, that you
haven't given up. You're pretty
confident about the quality of
our bands.

PP: Well, look over the past
year. We had twenty-seven
drummers who neverquite
learned our songs right and who
held us back from writing new
ones. We had very tepid feed-
back. We could have said
"Well, obviouslyit isn't work-
ing; let's hang itup." But we
didn't. ‘

DC: It has to be really hard"

before you give up. That's
something you learn all your life,
that you have to suffer before

you reap any benefits. You have

to pay your dues.
PP: Unless

Gordon Gano thinks that he
may be wanted bygthe Pittsburgh
police. Apparently he didn't no-
tice the ”Do Not Enter” sign post-
ed at a corner and just drove
down the street. He was pulled

over, warned and told that he had
better not be seen there again.

Well, even if the police depart-
ment doesn’t want him, his fans
certainly do. Over 900 people
packed the South Hills Theatre
last Saturday to see vocal-
ist/guitarist Gano and bandmates
Brian Ritchie (bass) and Victor
DeLorenzo (drums). Together
they are the Violent Femmes, one
of the most eclectic bands
around.

The Femmes had their official
start back in 1981. They would
play on street corners in their Mil-
waukee, Wisconsin home.

”We played outside on the
street because we thought it was
better than just sitting in my base-
ment or apartment rehearsing,”
DeLorenzo explained. ”We
thought it was better to go outside
and work with an audience, and
also figure out what it is about dy-
namics when you're playing
acoustic instruments together.”

As legend has it, it was during
one of their street corner perfor-
mances that they were disco-
vered. Chrissie Hynde of the
Pretenders chanced to walk by,
liked-what she saw (and heard),
and offered them the opportuni-
ty to open for the Pretenders.

For the most part, success has
been that simple for the Violent
Femmes. I

”We had no goals when we
began,” DeLorenzo said. ”The
only thing we were interested in
was playing music together.”

”No,” Ritchie argued, ”we had

MIDNIGHT

lenf

IIISS

JoonKone

a goal, kind of, to make a
record.” '

’’I put that under the heading
of playing together,” DeLorenzo
continued. "What you want to do
if you're playing music together
is get across to a larger audience,
which of course now means [via]
tapes or CD5 or records. We have
always gotten the most satisfac-
tion, the most pleasure, in just
getting together and playing our
music.”

’’It basically didn't take us that
long [compared to] most bands,
even to get our record. Although
at the time, it seemed
forever,” Ritchie admitted.

”Making the record was a
risk,” Cano said. ”The record
was done independently. Every-

’ body turned us down.”

”We had been offered a con-
tract from one label,” Ritchie cor-
rected. ”They said, ‘You guys
could be stars if you do your mus-
ic a lot differently,’ but we
wouldn't compromise.”

”By recording standards, there
was- no budget whatsoever for us.
From our perspective, it was a
tremendous financial step. The
record companies, all these peo-
ple who are supposed to know it
all, said ’No thanks’ or ‘You have

to change things,’ so we did it

ourselves,” Gano said.
Their strategy seems to'have

like

paid off. The Femmes offer some- .

thing for everybody "and ’the“"“\‘

results are uniquely refreshing.
Where else but at a Violent
Femmes show can you see mo-
hawked, leather-clad teens
stomping and clapping to a

-~ hoedown gospel tune along with

middle—aged yuppies, chanting
”Why can't I get just one screw?”
in perfect sync with the band?

Gano, who writes 95'percent
of the lyrics, credits their appeal
and success to their faith in their
collective talents. Ritchie just sim-
plifies it and attributes it to their
genius.

”We really pressed, and we

took risks. We felt very strongly ,l

about what we were doing and
we got some help when we need-
ed it,” he said.

-That help may refer to the‘

Pretenders and other industry
people, but‘just as likely, Ritchie
is referring to God. Gano, the son
of a preacher, is indeed a spiritu-
al man. Holy pictures, including

one of the Pope and one of Christ

on the crucifix, adorned their tour
bus’ walls, but Gano insists that

he doesn't intend to preach tohisi _   

fans. .

”The messages are messages-_iijﬁig I
I'm trying to get across to my- ,.T;;§ -
self,” he said. ”They’re things '.,,:-':f;;

that I had to do or had to say even

if no one hears it. Maybe some-_. _ jg  
body can find a responseto some  
of the things I've done. Personal-  ‘

ly, I need to write that song; I
need to doit. I don't just sit and
think ’What message do I want to
get out to somebody out there?’ ”

As for the musical. aspect of the
Femmes’ songwriting, the other
members contribute their respec-

» tive parts. ‘

doned quality to it that you can't

”It’s just a little term I use when
I'm doing things and I don't know
why,” says Tom Petty about the
title of the new Full Moon Fever,
his first album without the Heart-
breakers. ’’I thought the phrase
pretty well fit the circumstances
behind this album.”

Petty still shakes his head in
disbelief at the twists and turns it
took to complete his solo debut,
originally conceived in late 1987.

.The album had its genesis in a
chance meeting with George
Harrison's producer, Jeff Lynne,
at a traffic light that Thanksgiving.
Petty and Lynne met again soon
afterward at a restaurant, and
then they hooked up to kick

during the Christmas holidays.

Lynne and Petty became fast
buddies, and even faster collabo-

rators, whipping through the writ-
ing and recording of a pair of
tunes —— ”Yer So Bad” and ”Free
Fa|lin”’ —— in just two days.

’’I wasn't really planning on do-
ing a record,” Petty says. ”But the
Heartbreakers were spread out all
over the globe, and I thought,
‘Shoot, we done these in a day
each — we'll just go back and
write nine more and put out a
solo album.’ ” Like so many
other attempts at doing an instant
record, however, the project

eventually took more than a full .

year to complete.

Last summer, both Petty and
Lynne got happily sidetracked on
the Traveling Wilburys album
with pals Harrison, Roy Orbison
and Bob Dylan. Then Petty and
Lynne helped work on material
for Orbison’s comeback album,

That's the setting of C.P. Tay-

One of this production’s
greatest features isthe stage set-
ting. Pitt’s Studio Theatre is a drab
little box — perfect for this sort of
play. It enables an audience to be
a part of the production. The at-

swanky music, blaring sirens and
actors standing close enough to
touch — sends audience mem-
bers hurling back into the 40s.

The plot centers around the

and their experiences during the

girl who marries hastily at the
dawn of the war and is uncertain

Eric is a soldier who can't seem

Peggy Stott, Joyce's mother
(Lyn Fleischman), is a strict

Tom Petty goes it olone

Mystery Girl. Orbison also sat in
for some background vocals on
Full Moon Fever, while Harrison
sang backup and contributed
acoustic guitar on one track.

A different sort of time factor
also stalled the release of Petty’s
album, which was expected last
year: The nine songs Petty record-
ed totaled just 22 minutes, hard-
ly enough for an album. Petty
came up with six more songs, in-
cluding a ”mystical rocker” with
the Bangles that was never
finished to his satisfaction.

Full Moon Fever also reflects
many other influences. A
greatest—hits album by the Search-
ers, Petty says, led him to write
”Depending on You,” while the
jaunty ”You’re so Bad” owes a
solid debt to the Kinks.

Other songs popped out of odd
phrases Petty had picked up.‘The

Illinois Jacquet’s timeless tenor

Illinois Jacquet, one of the last
of the great swing—era tenor men,
is holding forth in the kitchen-
cum-dressing—room of Manhat-
tan's venerable Village Vanguard.

The saxophonist has just
finished a set that took his young
audience on a big—band guided
tour of every juke joint, dance
hall and blues dive Jacquet ever
played in along the fertile musi-
cal crescent that stretches from
Louisiana and Texas to Oklaho-

honcho Ahmet Ertegun, who
signed him up to record the
Grammy Award nominee lac-
quet’s Got It’), Jacquet has never
lost that deep blues feeling.

At 19, he burst on the scene
with the tenor gladness of Lionel
Hampton's 1942 hit ”Flying
Home,” and in 1944 he went on
to appear in Gjon Mili’s legen-
dary film short jamming the Blues
(featured throughout U2’s ”Angel
of Harlem” video).

 

cated chord changes and ballads
aligns him with the be-boppers,
even as his big four—on—the-floor
beat and earthy cry suggest the ul-
timate links between urban blues,
big—band swing and R&B.

On the set of

Equal Justice

With the recent influx of Holly-
wood filmmaking in the city,
many former Pittsburghers-
turned-stars have returned to film
their own movies or to make

cameo aonerances.

Michael Keaton, who is starring
this summer with Jack Nicholson
in Tim Burton's Batman, was a
native of Ambridge, Pennsylvania
and first began work for Mister

on, after he became so enor-

Stuck With Each Other, which

marks director George Stanford
Brown's second filming venture
in Pittsburgh. Brown, best
remembered for his role in tele-

The Neon Jungle here in 1987.

Shadow. Mike Farrell, who por-
trayed Captain B.J. Hunnicut on
M*A *S*H, came to Pittsburgh in
1987 to produce the highly ac-
claimed Dominick and Eugene
with Tom Hulce (Amadeus,
Animal House) and Jamie Lee
Curtis.

_ Veteran horror-meister George
A. Romero, who catapulted his
own career in Pittsburgh in the
late sixties with the highly in-
dependent, low-budget, drive-in
cult classic Night of the Living
Dead, also returned to his
hometown to film the experimen-

tal Monkey Shines with the aid of ~

Pittsburgh gore specialist Torn
Savini (Creepshow, Friday the
13th).

John ”Sol” Sutton, sound mix-
er on Equal Justice and a veteran
of PBS, is good friends with

Romero and says that the direc- A

tor’s choice is indicative of a lot
of filmmakers in Hollywood.
”Pittsburgh is basically used as
a generic city for these types of
films,” says Sutton. ”What a lot
of them look for is a city that
doesn't look like New York or
L.A. because everybody’s burned
out on those locales. Most peo-
ple know the buildings in New
York, and everybody has seen
L.A. That's one of the reasons
George likes Pittsburgh. Another
is the inexpensive location fees.”
The growth of Pittsburgh as a
cheap location for producers has
not only benefited the networks
and studios. Many local business-
es turn a large profit when a film
comes to town. The Vista, for ex-
ample (not a local business, mind
you, but a good local example),

housed two film companies last ‘

month and this month, turning
revenues that rival those of their

« competitors.

Metro Catering of Aliquippa,

' which feeds cast and crew daily, 

has made a -fortune catering gour— 

met dishes for L.A.’s elite.-
With two more films finished,
Pittsburgh promises to become a
major alternative ‘location for
‘low-budget Hollywood produc-

tions. Thinker Productions, lnc.,. '

a Pittsburgh independent compa-
ny, may garner more attention as
well, with its summer release of
John Ruso’s Heart_—Stopper star-
“ring Michael J. Pollard and Moon-
Unit Zappa._ "
But big-budget features are not
totally out of the question for
Pittsburgh, says Pittsburgh B Film
Bureau Director Ted Hanson.
With such films as The Deer.

Hunter, Flashdance and All the .

Right Moves, Pittsburgh may well

' have attracted some major atten-
1 tion fromtCalifornia big wigs.

”Look at Witness,” says Han-
son. “Lancaster County's Visitor's

Bureau reported 65,000 requests .

for information in 1984. jWhen

Witness came out one year later, _

requests jumped up’ to 115,000.
That is an incredible leap in in-
terest.” ' -

Could the same thing happen
to Pittsburgh? No one is certain,
but some big-league producers
have expressed a lot of interest.

Case in point: Alan Pakula re- 0

cently visited Pittsburgh to scout
locations for his film adaptation
of Scott Turow’s best-selling nov-
el Presumed Innocent. Gerry
Jenkins, Oscar-winning art direc-

tor for The China Syndrome, who .

accompanied Pakula here, says
he loved Pittsburgh and ex-
pressed great interest in the city's
history.

it's not certain, but if it happens

to come through, expect a lot of F

hullabaloo, because besides be-
mg a big film, it is also a starring

vehicle for Harrison Ford,-. .: . . . . . ‘ "I

Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre and it's leading lady 

By Cathleen S. Karlsso
Staff Writer

The lights slowly fade out. Vio-
lins in the orchestra begin to
hum. And then, dancers fill the
stage with the light, airy move-
ments of the ballet.

It is quite appealing and enter-
taining to sit back in a comforta-
ble chair, mesmerized by the
work being performed on the
stage. So much so that one tends
to forget it is actually work, which
a choreographer has spent time
developing in his mind and in
hours of practice sessions with
the dancers. Also overlooked is
that the majority of works creat-

 

ed are done so by male choreog-

raphers. Where are the women?

Dance —— dating back to the
Paleolithic Age when it was used
strictly as a means of ritual enact-
ment — has developed greatly
through the ages. Not only have
various styles come forth, but also
a dominance of male choreog-
raphers has emerged.

George Balanchine, said to
have created his own type of
ballerina with a long neck and
legs to fit his choreography, is
oneof the most highly acclaimed
choreographers of the twentieth
century. Some of his works in-
clude A ./Vlidsummer Night’s
Dream, Harlequinade, and his
version of Swan Lake.

Considering all forms of dance,

we must include other great male
choreographers Alvin Ailey,
Gene Kelly, Fred Astaire, Mark
Morris, Merce Cunningham, Art
Stone, Bob Fosse, and many
other artists whose pieces have
appeared in Vaudeville, movies,
musicals, on television and in
Broadway shows.

And yes, this list definitely in-
cludes many female artists as
well, though their names do not
seem to appear readily in one’s
mind unless you are, perhaps, a
dancer or someone greatly in-
terested in the art. Among the list,
for example, would be Twyla
Tharp, Ruth Page, Martha Gra-
ham, Agnes DeMi|le, Isadora
Duncan and Gillian Gregory.

If you are familiar with any of

9'“

THE PRESID

these women's names, can you
recall a piece they created or at
least picture a scene from it in
your mind? Probably not. Why‘ is
there this discrepancy between
knowledge of male and female
choreographers? Certainly, we
should not assume that choreog-
raphy by men is simply more
memorable than that done by
women.

Isadora Duncan is best known
for her type of abstract balletic
dances of the early twentieth cen-
tury. Despite being a leading
woman in the field of modern
dance creation, she had little for-
mal training, and therefore, pass-
ing on her style of choreography
was difficult.

sat up and took notice. ”An-

al hit. ”When I Grow Up” is just
now taking off, accompanied by
a smash-status video making the
rounds at MTV.

In between, she toured Ameri-

Billy Bragg. The two even wrote
a song together, ”Looking for a

played folk standards as a duo,

  

covering ”WilI the Circle be Un-

She's Michelle—Shocked, a na-

to write songs?

A: It was a challenge, and there
was good inspiration in Austin
where I was living. I just finally
asked myself, ”I wonder if I could
do that?”

Q: Do you still remember" any
of your first songs?

A: I do remember the first one
’cause it was really terrible. What
was it called, though... Oh, ”Hey
Mister Love.” Or something like
that. But soon after that, ’cause I
was writing in isolation, really,
and teaching myself guitar, I start-
ed writing songs that I even stand
by to this day. I used the things
that I discovered on guitar as the
source of inspiration for writing
a lyric to go with it.

Q: What is the songwriting
process like for you now?

A: Lately it's the backburner ap-
proach to songwriting; just keep

.1.

, your eyes and ears open for a
I good hook line. lt’s,focusing on

a hook line instead of looking for
a story.

I was reading the paper about
the anarchy going on right now
in Malaysia. I forget which island

country it was, but they were hav- _

ing elections and the left wing
party threatened to mow anyone
down with machine guns who
went to the ballot. One of the
politicians was quoted as saying
that this was a battle between the

 

  

ballot and the bullet, and that the
bullet must not win. So now I've
got a song started. I'm writing a
song every month, and this
month's is called ”On the Green-
er Side.” It’s to suggest that the
grass is always greener on the
greener side. Next month I'll
work on ”The Ballad of the Bal-
lot and the Bullet.” Does that do
anything for you?

Q: Yeah, it sounds good. With
inspiration being so important to
you,‘ did you find going into the
studio for the first time difficult,
or was it fun?

A: No, I wasn't quite trauma-

. tized the first time ’cause I didn't

know the extent to which I could
trust [my producer] Pete Ander-
son's taste or judgement. This
next one’s going to be great. I just
met with Pete last week about it,
and I'm really looking forward to
it. ’

We butted heads the first night
back this second time, but then
he turned around to me the next
day and said, ”You know we
didn't worry about airplay or sin-

gles when we made the last one.”

He had started thinking, ”Oh, I
get it. They've started marketing
her as a female singer/songwriter
and all this stuff.” But the material
I want to work with next isn't so
much an emphasis on that. The
working title, for example, is
”The Swing Vote.” It's to raise the
argument that swing is a feeling
and everything else is just style.
That's probably one_ of the
greatest abilities of music — to ex-
press feelings not’ just in your
head but in your body. And I
know now to trust him, now that
I think we’ve agreed on the same
thing. y

Q: The last record earned you
a grammy nomination. Does that
excite you? ' ‘

A: [laughs] It's a big deal, but
it's rather ironic, you know? I try
to be very outspoken about my
basic motive for working in the
system, which is to destroy it
from within. Then they turn
around and try to give you an
award for it! [almost giggles] But
I would love nothing more than
to claim for songwriters the
resources that have gone out to

heavy metal and dance pop.-

Q: Is it hard working with a big
label and maybe not having a lot
ofpeople there who are familiar
with your goals as an artist or an
activist?

A: Yeah. Well, I feel like I came
into it pretty pragmatically,
though. I know what their bottom
line is. If I really believe that I can
go in and change things, that
would be another matter. But I
know what I do with my money,
and my time is my business and
what they do with theirs is their
business. It's kinda like appropri-
ating, redirecting sources. Doing
that, I feel justified, somehow.
Self-righteous, even, I suppose.

Q: It must be frustrating work-
ing with such a big company.
Like in your press kit, there's a
review of your album from Pent-
house, which I wouldn't guess is
a favorite magazine of yours.

A: Or doing this Vogue photo
session. Yeah, all this stuff. But I

I guess my basic justification —

and I don't want to take justifica-
tion too far —— is to acknowledge
that I would've never signed to a
major label if I wanted to avoid
contradictions. I felt like the
resource that I was trying to claim
for this kind of music was acces-
sible. And that's why they have
mainstream media access. If I
wanted to stay a purist so much,
I - shouldn't have signed to

Polygram.

This is the first I knew of the
review in Penthouse. We'll have
to wait for that Playboy interview
offer to see what I do, I guess
[laughs].

I thought about doing a beer
commercial, too, instead of mak-
ing a video to promote that kind
of music my father turned me on
to quite early — traditional, old-
time, in—the—mountain music, fid-
dle tunes — it seems like that's
what commercials do as much as
anything. Like Levis commer-
cials. They've basically created a
renaissance of blues, just because
it's the background to whatever
it is they're selling. They get so
extreme that they just mention
the product at the very end.

I consider things and try to look
and see how much my justifica-
tions are just justifications,
though.

Q: I could see a lot of flack
coming from doing a com-
mercial.

A:' Yeah, but this is the other
thing I was thinking about:
Doesn't everyone drink beer
whether you're politically correct
or not? [laughs] I know they do
in England. I'd probably feel
stronger about doing something
for Coca-Cola than I would about
doing a beer commercial.

ic.” Do you agree with that?

A: I certainly do. I have so
much anger against what I refer
to as these self-appointed censors
of culture. Basically, these guys
feel justified in what they present
and sell and market 'cause they
say they've gone out and done
the leg work, they've listened to

"the music and they've decided
what's commercial, what's good
and what isn't. They say they
have the hardest job because
most of the music they listen to
is bad and by virtue of that, there-
fore, most of the music we can
listen to is good.

I feel like they've missed the
point completely. They've turned
things around so far that now
people play live to sell records.
Where I stand with Billy Bragg on
that is that I will always feel you
sell records to give yourself the
.opportunity to play live. But I still
curse a system that has things to

L I
such an extreme, that to feel like
music is happening, and exciting,
you have to be playing in a stadi-
um arena.

If they could've decentralized
what happened with that Am-
nesty tour for example, and had
all that happening but on a local
level, that would've been a real
change. But it's all about control.
Capitalism is killing music —
yeah, I helped Billy make a pro-
mo video and said [in an exagger-
ated drawl], "What does that
mean, Mr. Bragg — capitalism is
killing music?"

Q: What things do you want to
see yourself and other artists
doing?

A: The vision I carry and what
I would like to work towards is
working in the midlevel of
community-building activities.
Being a resource for activities and
organizations, focusing issues,
setting agendas, expropriating
resources and just getting in-
sights. Really it's that old argu-
ment —— do you change the
system by staying outside of it, -or
change it from working inside? I
haven't resolved it; that's where
I'm working right now. .

Q: What are some of the polit-
ical and social issues outside of
music that intrigue you most right
now?

A: I'm intrigued by all of them,
but when I try to focus, and that's
how you have to be effective, by
focusing your commitment,
AIDS, the issue of the homeless
and the basic commitment to rais-
ing the issue of racism are three
focuses. I really feel like the so-
lution to racism is just constantly
raising the issue so that people
have to confront it.

I've given you three focuses,
but I would like to then point out
that they all come from the point
of view of a feminist. So whether
you could say that I'm committed
to feminism or that I'm just a
feminist committed to the issues
I pointed out — that kind of int-
rigues me, expressing it like that.

Q: What made you decide to A

move to England and call your-
self an expatriot?

A: I do feel there is an alterna-
tive there. In England and Europe
is a system that honors the notion
of opposition politics. I don't feel
that way about [the United States]

While dated hepcats hang
around smoking in the city's dim-
ly lit lounges, grooving to recy-
cled bebop, jazz as an
improvisational form is being re-
born for the twenty-first century
at the Sonic Temple.

This Saturday, the Wilkinsburg
performance space will feature
avant-garde ensemble Machine
Gun, who usually gig at New
York City's premiere experimen-
tal venue, the Knitting Factory.

Although the group has been

‘ together for two years, Machine

Gun’s guitarist, Robert Musso,
has been active in sessions for
years, contributing to albums by
Ginger Baker and Tom Waits.

The recent Machine Gun LP fea-
tures Last Exit guitarist Sonny
Sharrock on most of side two,
since Musso is_ friends with Bill
Laswell and helped produce the
fourth Last Exit record.

Musso describes the sound of
Machine Gun as aggressive, free
music: ”Our music is complete-
ly improvised. The members of
the group have known each other
for a long time, so the music fits
together well. The object is not to
play jazz or rock  but to come
up with something different.”

The name for the group origi-
nated from an album, produced
in 1969 on a German free-music
label, which included avant sax-

rT1ACI|—IIl\l EgLJ I\l o

ophonists Peter Brotzmann and
Evan Parker. Machine Gun are
extending their idea of a non-
blues—based jazz form.

Because of the unusual aspects
of the music, Machine Gun at-
tract a diverse audience, accord-
ing to Musso. ”Some relate to us
as a noise band, others as a jazz
band.”

Machine Gun have stirred up
considerable interest due to a
favorable review in Spin and

opening spots for such bands as_

Living Colour and B.A.L.L. ”At
our last Knitting Factory perfor-
mance, Elliot Sharp started with
a solo computer set; then later, he
jammed with us,” Musso recalls.

Machine Gun will continue to
sharpen their improv assault with
a second LP to be released soon
on their own MU label.
However, Saturday night will be
a rare experimental and adven-
turous opportunity to see them,
because the bassist and drummer
live in Sweden and don't often
play live concerts.

Local improvisers Gus Is Gay
will be playing their third live
show after successful concerts at
the Foundry and on the air at
WYEP. On the WPTS Local Im-
ages show, bassist Tom Marinel-
li defined the main objectives of
Gus Is Gay —— ”musical conver-
sationalism,” which amounts to

Shocked

Continued from page 17
now.

I am encouraged by the fact
that we've got a Democratic Con-
gress. If I can spend some time
over here making trouble for
Bush and tying his hands up be-
hind his back, maybe Congress
can take the initiative. I'm not
sure that it'll work, but maybe.

There came a point with the
Reagan administration where I
felt like I couldn't do anyhing.
There was nothing I could do. But
I do know I'm doing a benefit in
D.C. for the Christic Institute,
which is a legal organization
which has had a lawsuit pending,
a civil one, against [Oliver] North
since 1987, and seems to me in
a lot stronger position than this
criminal case they're trying to run

on him with the justice depart-
ment. They've had subpoena
powers since I987, the same
subpoena power that resulted in
dropping some of the charges
against North in the criminal
case. So they've got the docu-
ments as well, but they're run-
ning him on a racketeering
charge.

They won the Karen Silkwood
case; that's who the Christic In-
stitute is. It's a real pragmatic ap-
proach to radical politics —-
lawyers, guns and money.

Q: Are you still a citizen of the
U.S.; do you still vote here?

A: I think the question more
than where you vote is where
you pay taxes. I pay taxes in
England.

Q: Are you as active in issues
there as you are in American
issues?

A: In a way, England's a sanc-
tuary. The socialist history there
makes it possible to kind of find
your little niche and cruise. You
know who the people that you
have something in common with
are, and you know where to find
them. I do that especially in En-
gland with the women's commu-
nity, which I feel is a lot more
organized and visible and active
than it is here. I mean it's here,
it's just not as visible. In England,
that's where I make my home,
and that's where my friends are.
I end up doing a lot of my
benefits there and orienting ef-
forts towards that. I just like hang-
ing out and entertaining the

Iallet

the way men and women choreo-
graph works because "the per-
spective is different  and how
you deal with life.''

According to‘McCu|lough, her
husband Rick, who was a ballet
master with PBT and has created
many more works than she has,
is not biased against women as
choreographers. He does not
lean toward male dominance in
a company's productions.

She explained the dominance
of male choreography over the
years as the result of tradition in
the major companies because
they are run by men. It is not the
case that men have not let wom-
en choreograph, but rather that
the women just have not always
been in the position to do it. But
McCullough says, "Now, with so

OU

 rpm

many women running. compa-
nies [such as Patricia Wilde with
PBT], there will be much more
[input by them.]”

McCullough herself will be
premiering her work Het Ander
Kant (The Other Side) with_PBT
at Benedum Center on.April 13
through 16. Her inspiration came
from a friend's experience deal-
ing with the tragedy of stillbirth.
The piece portrays a family cop-
ing with the loss of the ‘child.

"It usually takes me about two
weeks to choreograph some-
thing. - My pieces aren't very
long,'' McCullough stated, ex-

plaining that she sees ”certain.

things [within the work] clearly’’
in her head before it is created,
but basically makes it up as she
goes along. -

''I look at it as though I'm sit-
ting in the audience. The hard
part is reversing all the steps to
[make it real].”

Others of McCullough's works
include Across An Echo Void,
Seven Last Words of Christ, and
various workshop pieces for the
School of Dance in North Caro-
Iina, which is where both she and
her husband studied.

Her future plans are many and
varied. She would like to create
pieces to Strauss’ Four Last Songs
and Shakespeare's sixty-sixth son-
net, set to music by Shostakovich
— a performance which would
include a live singer.

troops, I guess, rather than
preaching to the converted.

Q: Is that where you met Billy
Bragg?

A: Mm-hm. He has a very
unique role over there that I don't
really think translates when he
comes over here. The socialist
tradition has long justified mixing
pop culture and politics. It's very
amazing seeing him try to trans-
late that to the American ex-
perience. [laughs] It's kind of
funny — like speaking a foreign
language though you're speaking
English. You're using all the lan-

guage socialists around the world
would understand, but we've
never really developed that tradi-
tion here.

Like me, he's got his commit-
ments and motivations, but I also
think he's committed to just writ-
ing good songs. My vision, I
guess, has more to do with show-
ing people how simple it is to ex-
press yourself if you have
something to say. I need three
chords, a pretty basic melody line
and roots influences that are easy
to track. That's all I need.

To an extent, DeLorenzo is ab-

Richards ishaving fun
during his first spring
drills as a Pitt Panther

By Vince Carey
Sports Editor

In a heartbreaking season for
Pitt football fans, the team having
finished at 6-5 without a bowl
game, there was one substantial
bright spot. That was freshman
running back Curvin Richards.
Richards came from nowhere
(well, actually Trinidad by-way of
LaPorte, Texas) to shatter fresh-
man records on his way to a
1,228 yard season, including
eight touchdowns.
It didn't start out that way,
though. Richards went into the
season as the third tailback on the
depth chart. Due to an injury to
starter Adam Walker during the
third game of the season and his
202 yards against Boston College
in game four, Richards became
_the No.1 guy. ' ‘
He went on to rush for over
200 yards in three games, the first
freshman Pitt runner "to accom-
plish that feat since Tony Dorsett
did it in 1973. He is fifth on Pitt's
all-timesingle season rushing list
and was named‘ The Sporting
News freshman of the year.
Through the second week of
spring drills, Richards is undoubt-
edly on top of the chart and
should be the premiere Pitt run-
ner throughout the season. Yet,
he says that hasn't changed him
at all.
”Everything is still the same
with me,” the 5-foot-10.

Liggins hoping to improve tight ends in

offense is going,” said Liggins. ’’I
always tell them to work hard
and do what they're supposed to
do right, and everything will pay
off. -
’’I’m sure if they're running the
right routes and making the right
reads on the coverages, then the
ball will be thrown to them.”
Larry Kirksey, one of Pitt's new
coaches, will take over the run-
ning back coaching duties for

"t '-;« ..~.«".z ~. .-.~':- ». *':—;.i~ . 

190—pound Richards said. ’’I
come out to practice, I still go
100 percent and do the best I can
for the team. That's what it's all
about for me. Anything I can do
for the team is what I'm going to
do.”

A few players described spring
drills as ”just something you have
to do to keep thecoaches hap-
py.” Richards, in his first spring
practice, likes what is going on.

”We do more hitting and
scrimmaging at V practice,"
Richards said. ”There are more’

game-like situations. Everything is .

at full-speed.‘We’re tackling and
running the plays just like we
would run them in a game.”

That can't be all; there has to
be something else.

”The best thing about it is that
there is no conditioning after
practice. There is no extra run-
ning after practice,” Richards said
as he breathed heavily, a result of
spending extra time running
plays.

For this season, Coach Mike
Gottfried said that he will be us-
ing more than one running back
becauseyof the depth at the posi-
tion. Richards likes the situation.

”l don‘t mind it at all. It's good
because it will give me more time
to rest. We have a lot of good“
running backs on. the team, and
they should get a chance to play
and show people what they can

La crosse team keeping $

things in perspective as
they continue to win

By Ed Kuznik
Staff Writer

The Pitt men's lacrosse team is
on an early season roll, having
won four of their first six games,
the highest midseason total that
Pitt has ever had.

The Panthers won 6-4 last night
at Pitt Stadium to improve their
season record to 4-2. Lee Stem-
ber scored two goals to lead Pitt
in their effort, while Spencer
Borisoff, Phil Preston, Harper
Watters and Steve Hudsonalso
notched -scores.

Because the win followed a
disappointing 7-1 road loss to
West Virginia» on Sunday after.-
noon, the Panthers seemed satis-
fied that -the team was on their
way to climbing up the ladder
which will lead them to respec-
tability in lacrosse circles.

”We’re doing really_well right
now,” team co-captain Orfeu
Buxton said. ”Our only problem
is that we can't play in the mud,
and that's all the other teams
seem to have. We win. athome
when the field's not a factor."

Indeed, Pitt seems to have no
trouble at all on the artificial sur-
face at Pitt Stadium, considering
both their losses have come on
the road. H

The West Virginia contest was
a good example, as an under-
manned Pitt squad hit Moun-
tain_eer territory hoping to find
playable " conditions, but
weekend rains made the field
”unbearable,” in the words of co-
captain Michael Neuman.

”A lot of people weren't able

to make that game,” Neuman
stated. ”We only had 11 people
show up — just enough to start
the game. Plus the field was just
a swamp of mud. There was no

traction and enormous puddles-

on both ends of the field.

“It was a sloppy game, and the
ball was on the ground a lot. It
was hard hitting, but there were
a lot of loose balls and just some
bad playing for that game. They
had their entire team, and they
just wore us down.”

Despite that setback, the Pan-
thers seemed tohave proved that

they can compete on the club-

levelwith more than moderate‘

' success. Besides wins over Slip-

pery Rock and John Carroll, Pitt
also got by one of the best squads
in the area: Carnegie Mellon.

”We’re 3-0 as a home team,
and_ we're looking forward to
having a couple of our players
who aren't healthy right now
back soon,” Neuman said.

”Our defense is excellent,”
Watters added. ”Right now, we
just have to work a little bit with
our midfielders in controlling the
tempo of the contest. We kind of
have to get together on the road,

The Panthers next game is

handed Pitt a loss this season.

Is it possible for Larry Brown to
leave the Spurs for the Big Ten?

Wanna hear a good one?

No, this isn't going to be a Pete
Rose gambling riddle. Or a Steve
Garvey paternity pun. Or even an
old Bud Dwyer giggler.

This one is much, much more
funny. Better sit down. Ready?

The San Antonio Express-News
reported on Tuesday that Larry
Brown, head coach of the NBA
San Antonio Spurs, ”expressed
interest” in the University of
Michigan job, which was recent-
ly and ironically vacated in a
somewhat Brownian manner by
Bill Frieder, when the Spurs were
in Detroit last.month.

Frieder, if you'll remember,
signed a contract with Arizona
State only days before his Wol-
verines were to play their first
game in the NCAA tournament,
thereby paving the way for assis-
tant Steve Fisher's unlikely jaunt
into the ‘limelight.

Fisher, in a series of moves
which could best be described as
a reverse-touche-deja-vu-holy-
mackeral-with-a-pinch-of-poetic-
righteousness, led a newly blaz-
ing Michigan team right to its first
national championship.

Oh, sorry, I almost forgot. The
punch line.

Well, the punch line, if you'll
pardon my laughter, is (ha ha
ha)... the punch line... Wanna
know what Brown said? Larry
Brown said, ”That‘is probably the
most ridiculous thing I have ever
heard.”

6 Get it? Can you imagine?! Lar-

ry Brown saying, ”that is the most
ridiculous thing I have ever
heard” to reports that he's leav-
ing his team for another job?!
That's like John'Candy saying
”What stomach rolls?”
Needlessto say, Brown is once
again disillusioned with the NBA,
where. his Spurs are floundering
away at a 19-53 pace, the fourth-
worst record in the league.
He's out of the national picture.
As a matter of fact, the general

population hasn't heard a peep
from Brown since he resigned
from the head coach's chair at the
University of Kansas — a team
that, very uncoincidentally is
now on probation for recruiting

violations — and first took the San
Antonio job a year ago.
One thing Larry Brown likes,

aside from "high-paying contracts, _

i-s the national spotlight. And it's
not yet shining in San Antonio, at
least not without 6-foot-1 1 David
Robinson, who isn't scheduled to
arrive in Texas till next season.

Brown has coached, in order,
the Denver Nuggets, UCLA (the

first program he left waddling in,

NCAA probation), the New Jer-
sey Nets, Kansas and the Spurs.

The pattern strongly suggests
that he is due to take yet another
college job (Michigan, with its
”interim” coach?), lead the team
to an appearance in a national
championship game, deny every
allegation that he might be mov-
ing on, then skip out to another
NBA stinker (the Clippers, with

i’

it

"'1 $2‘

  Greek Week Continues 

their ”interim" talent?) before the
hounds from the NCAA sniff out
more recruiting no—nos and throw
the book at the helpless program.

The most ridiculous thing I ever
heard was the story about this
turn-of-the-century guy who had
the misfortune of getting a rail-
road tie shot through his brain
and ended up living a fairly nor-
mal life, though without much of
a memory.

It turned out to be very much
the truth. Ripley's Believe-It-Or-
Not verified it. The spike and the

-man's skull are even on display
' at Harvard. ,
‘ ' But if the Brown/Michigan

report proves to be a factual ac-
count, one place you surely
won’.t read about it is in Ripley's.

In the last decade, no con-
ference has won more college
basketball national champion-
ships than the Big Ten.

Michigan State captured the
title in 1979. Indiana won it
twice, both in 1981 and 1987.
And this year, the Michigan
Wolverines won? their first
NCAA championship.

But in the last 10 years, no
conference has been a closer
runner-up than -the’Big East.

Aside from winning two na-
tional titles since its inception
in 1979 —- Georgetown won
it in 1984 and Villanova in
1985 -— 26 seconds worth of

separated the Big East Confer-

play in Major League baseball

By Mike Nadel
AP Sports Writer

MINNEAPOLIS — Supposedly,
Tommy John didn't throw hard
enough to get a major—league
offer.

OK, so he got the offer. But
he'd never make it to the majors.

OK, so he made it. But he'd
never be a consistent winner.

OK, so he won. But he'd never
recover from severe ligament
damage to his left elbow.

OK, so he recovered. But he'd

, never be a big winner again.

OK, so he had three 20-victory
seasons. But he'd never keep
pitching until his 40th birthday.

OK, so he passed 40. But, at
45, he'd surely never make it
back this season.

OK, so he made it. But he'd
never get anyone out.

OK, Tommy, enough already.
The rest of us will be all dead and
gone and you'll probably still be
pitching 'em low and outside.

/\/lost pro players like Olympic idea”

By Bill Barnard

AP Basketball Writer

Almost two-thirds of NBA‘ play-
ers think professionals should be
allowed in the Olympics, but
only 58 percent said they would
play, according to a survey by
The Associated Press.

 The majority of those opposed

to participation said the games
are better suited to‘college play-
ers and that NBA players would
make a travesty of the compe-
tition.

Others said that it would dis-
rupt their family life, or that they
doubted NBA owners would let
them play.

‘ FIBA, the international govern-

STOP!

... and think of what your life would be like if you couldn’t do the ‘following things

fooled all the experts, he's just
about outlived them all.
”People have doubted me
since I was 19 years old, saying
that I couldn’t throw hard or I
wouldn't belong in the majors,”
said the New York Yankee left-
hander, who started his 26th big-
league season Tuesday with a 4-2

victory over the Minnesota.

Twins. ”Back in '61, when I
signed, people in my hometown
were saying, ‘Who are you trying
to fool?’

”And here I am. I feel as strong
now at 45-plus as I have in the
last 10 years.”

Add the Twins to the list of
people who have been fooled by
John. They were at a loss to ex-
plain how he was getting them
out. ,

Randy Bush: ’’It looks like he
just lobs it up there, but you can't
hit it.”

Kirby Puckett: ”He didn't
throw me a strike all night. I was
just swinging away.”

Dan Gladden: ”If you ask the

ing body for basketball, is expect-
ed to vote Friday at Munich, West
Germany, to open Olympic
basketball to all professional play-
ers beginning with the 1992
Games in Barcelona.

”I would go in a heartbeat,”
said Karl Malone of-the Utah
Jazz. ”l’d pay my own ticket over
there. ‘It teed me off when the
Russians were high-fiving like
they had beaten America's best,
and I knew they hadn’t.”

A total of 185 players — 62.7
percent. — answered yes when
asked by the AP if NBA players
should be allowed in the Olym-
pics. One hundred, or 33.9 per-
cent said no; 10 had no answer
or no opinion.

Asked if they would play, 172

guys, I think they will say they
were getting themselves out.”

To be sure, John didn't get
everybody out. The Twins had 10
hits and left the bases loaded
twice.

”He’s been doing the same
thing forever,” Twins manager
Tom Kelly said. ”He ran it away,
sank it away, kept it down and
outside. We got plenty of hits.
We just couldn’t get any when
we needed them. There was a lot
of skill involved, a lot of
know-how.” '

Every time John pitches, he
reaches a new milestone.

Tuesday night, his 691st career
start moved him past Gaylord
Perry into fourth all-time and his
287th victory allowed him to
pass Robin Roberts into 20th
place. He also tied Deacon
McGuire’s record by opening his
26th season. If he was living,
McGuire would be even older
than John, having pitched from
1884-1912.

players, or 58.3 percent, said yes;
114, or 38.6 percent, said no;
and the rest, nine players, had no
answer or no opinion.

Only 139 of 295 NBA players
contacted by the AP said yes to
both questions; that is 47.1
percent. ’

Even if those who said they
wouldn't did not play, a pool of
players remains for a formidable
team.

A potential starting five would .

include Malone and Philadel-
phia’s Charles Barkley at for-
wards, 1984 Olympian Patrick
Ewing of New York at center,
Magic Johnson of the Lakers at

point guard and Portland's Clydea

Drexler at shooting guard. .

Hockey fans will see the Pens
and Flyers in playoff round two

With the Patrick Division
playoffs upon us, anything can
happen to the four teams in-
volved. This is the time of the sea-
son characterized by good, fast,
crisp hockey, entire teams with
beards and a little senseless
violence.

It is also the first time the Pen-
guins have been to postseason
play since 1982. And going into
the playoffs with a two—game win-
ning streak in the Philadelphia
Spectrum, the ’Guins are a team
on an all-time confidence high.

So, with that in mind, here are
some predictions for the playoffs

game has been played):

A few weeks ago, I thought the
Penguins were the second-worst
team in all of hockey, mainly be-
cause their only goal production
came from Mario Lemieux or a
member ofihis line. The Pens
were playing horrendous
defense, losing faceoffs and being

,, consistently beaten to the puck.

However, all that seems to
have changed. Kevin Stevens has
come into his own lately and has
turned out to be quite an offen-
sive threat.

Paul Coffey has stopped worry-
ing about scoring goals and has
concentrated on what is happen-
ing behind his own blue line.
And Coffey has done what he
does better than anyone in the

Tennis———

No.3 in the East, and [Mills and
Garrard] defeated them 7-6 in the
third set — so that's probably the
finest doubles showing in the past
25 years of Pitt tennis,” Dieffen-
bach said.

The second outstanding show-
ing was turned in by Kumar
against~Robert Morris, helping
Pitt win 5-4. .

In both his doubles match with
Maben and his singles match, Ku-
mar lost the first set, but came
back to win the final two.

”Vivek was our only player
who won both his singles and
doubles; without either of those
twovictories, we would have lost
that match,” said Dieffenbach.

The team concludes its season
next Wednesday against Mercy-
hurst, but has nine more matches
between now and then to reach

I the .500 mark.

”We go against Buffalo on
Saturday. We need to beat them
along with Mercyhurst. Those are
the key matches, but the tough-
est one will be Ohio University
on Sunday. But we're really com-
ing together as a team; we're
working hard toward our goal of
a winning season,” said
Dieffenbach.

league in recent games: deliver-
ing long passes to Lemieux,
Brown, etc.

MIKE
RAM PA

Zarley Zalapski, though small
and not very physical, has be-
come an effective defender.

The biggest problem the Pen-
guins face is getting muscled
around, out—checked and simply
taking too much of a beating by
bigger, more aggressive teams.

The Rangers are a team in tur-
moil. They lack confidence, their
coach has recently been canned
and even Phil Esposito is worried.

Enough said. Pens in 6.

Next, we have the Capitals and
the Flyers.

The Flyers are simply an ex-
perienced, tough team. Rick Toc-
chet has played his best hockey
toward the latter half of the sea-
son, finishing up with 45 goals on
the year.

Tim Kerr is a force to be reck-
oned with on the ice due to the
extremely physical nature of his
play.

Goalie Ron Hextall is the best
in the league at getting the puck
out of his own end on power
plays. He is equally adept at

keeping the Philly power play go-
ing by stepping up to nearly his
own blue line so his men won't
have to skate too far back for the
biscuit.

But mostly, the Flyers are
animals — hard-checking, aggres-
sive hockey players who consis-
tently beat teams by wearing
them down physically. Combine
this with their well-honed hock-
ey skills and you will have a team
that will take Washington and its
former convict (Ciccarelli), and
have them back in D.C. watching
Philly and the Pens squaring off
in an al|—Pennsylvania divisional
final on TV.
