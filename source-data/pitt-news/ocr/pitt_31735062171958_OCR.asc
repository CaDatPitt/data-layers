In these days of advocacy. it
is nearly impossible for media
to maintain objectivity. Our
campus media are no different.

acteristic style of delivery. and
it is often difficult to separate
to their opinion from fact.

As a public service to our
readers, the Pitt News would
like to do something to allevi-
ate this problem of objectivity.

We could stop slanting stories
I in our own paper, but that would
involve too much work.

Instead, to make students
more aware of the biases of the
various campus media, we will
I take a hypothetical news story

THE UNIVERSITY TIMES .

A spokesman for the Chancel-
lor said today that a general tui-
tion hike for the Fall Term is
“probable. ”

The spokesman, who wished to
7 remain anonymous, said that
“rising costs and an expected cut
in our allocation from the State
make a rise in tuition probable."

I The spokesman said that if en-
“> acted, the "tuition hike would

of Pennsylvania another “$50-
$75” per term. Out-of-state stu-

dents would conceivably be hit

If enacted, the tuition hike
would be the second for the Uni-
C versity in as many years.’ Last
I summer, tuition for Pennsylvania
. residents increased $40 per term.
I while out-of-state students were
assessed a $75 per term increase. I

 The spokesman said that should
the State Legislature grant the

~University sufficient funds. the

sary. “At this point," he said. “it

does not seem that the Legisla-
ture will do that.” I

The spokesman made the an-
nouncement at a news conference
I attended by all campus media.
Chancellor Wesley Posvar was
out of town at the time of the
,_ conference and unavailable for
comment.

THE PITTNEWS
Well, gang, tighten up those

money belts and remember the"

good old days. Tuition is sky-
rocketing again.

Charles Montgomery. Vice
Chancellor of Finance. announc-
ed today that a tuition raise for
the Fall Term was "almost a
surething.”

Montgomery. who asked to re-
main anonymous. said that "ris-
ing costs and an expected cut in
our allocation from the State
make a rise in tuition probable."
Though he didn't come right out
and say it. Montgomery implied
that the real reason for the tui-
tion increase was to line the
pockets of the administrative big-
wigs.

If enacted, this tuition hike
would be the second ripoff by
the State Legislature in two
years. Last summer, $40 was
squeezed out of Pennsylvania
residents, while out of state stu-

dents were bled to the tune of

70 more bucks a term.

Of course. if the Legislature
comes up with enough money
for us. no tuition raise will be
necessary. At least that‘s what
Montgomery said. But how likely
is that?

Montgomery broke the bad
newsat a press conference for
all campus media. The Chancel-
lor was out of town somewhere.
probably on a safari in Africa.

THE MAGIC BUS

In another slap at University
commuters, a spokesman for
Chancellor Posvar announced to-
day that tuition would be going
up again in the fall.

The anonymous spokesman did
not say directly how the tuition
hike would effect the Commuter
Association (CA), but he did say
that we could “expect a cut in
our allocation.” "

It figures. Everybody knows
that Pitt is predominantly a
commuter campus. and that any
raise in tuition effects commut-

ers more than any other group.
But the Legislature in Harrisburg
ignored us last year when they
raised tuition. and apparently
they are going to ignore us
again this year.

Well. we‘ve just about had it.
Commuters are no longer going
to accept these affronts passive-
ly. We're going to fight back.
Listen‘ well. Chancellor Posvar.

And speaking of the Chancel-
lor, he didn’t even have enough
courage to show at the press

‘conference and make the an-

nouncement himself. He had to
get Montgomery to do it for
him.

THE OWL

And remember your senior
year? Yes. that was the year the
Panther began to growl. The
year Lenny Klavonik was Stu-
dent Government‘ President and
the year tuition was hiked for
the second consecutive session.

Can you ever forget it? There
was Edison Montgomery. upon
the podium. Around him were
representatives of each of the
campus media. As they scribbled
furiously on their pads. they
heard Montgomery tell them
that a'tuition increase was neces-
sary because of “rising costs and
an expected cut in our alloca-
tion from the state."

Do you_remember the meals
skimped and clothes mended in

I order to save that extra $50 per

term for tuition? Or if you were
an out of stater, that extra $75?

Coarse Courses Offerred

A new series of courses. with
the accent on informality and
relevancy. will be introduced
this fall. Dr. Jerome Seawind.
Dean of the ‘College of Arts
and Sciences, announced that all
of the new courses will be taught
as interdisciplinary.

Seawind said that the courdes
would “ . . attempt to give stu-
dents different perspectives on
University life."

“‘We hope to give students,
with these new courses some
more practical ideas of the way
a university is run,” said Sea-
wind. “Many of the courses will
study campus organizations in the
hope that students will gain an
understanding of the community
they live and study in.”

Among the courses scheduled
for fall implementation are the
following: — ‘

Campus Security 80

This course will attempt to
give students some idea of how
a large. urban university is made
safe for its community. Course
will then examine such security
methods at the University. All of
the latest techniques in campus
security will be critically analyz-
ed. ‘

Particular attention will be
given to bombs and bomb threats.
All methods used by the Secur-
ity Police to detect and defuse
hidden bombs will be studied.
The very latest methods, such
as prayer and spirit exorcism
will be discussed in detail.

Texts: Though no definite text
books have as yet been chosen.
all reading material fg the
course will be available at
Jake‘s News Stand.

Prerequisites: Absolutely none.

proaches. Some of these include:
“Do you have any spare change;
I need only $.50 for bus fare,”
and for students who exhibit a

this course. no text books will
be required. However. those stu-
dents talented enough to burn
any books whatsoever will be
given extra credit.

Tests: There will be one mid-
term and a comprehensive final.

Administration 80

This course will focus on stu-
dent administration, and special
attention will be given to the
Student Association (SA). All
of the ins and outs of the Stu-
dent Association will be explor-
ed. Students should gain a great-
er understanding of how the
Commissioners reach their de-
cisions, unless the official SA

ouija board used by the Com?

missioners is considered off
limits.

Students will also be assigned
a Commissioner and required to
spend several days with him.
working at his side and learning
how he spends his time. And.
should students become bored
with pinochle. alternate assign-
ments will be handed out.

Texts: Course will employ

In a landmark decision. sever-
al key administrators met Tues-
day to drastically alter several
of the Universitys operating
policies.

The action. allegedly prompt-
ed by a particularly stirring col-
umn by Prof. Lee Lawrence of
the English Department in last
Sundays Pittsburgh Press. was
taken unanimously after about
three hours of closed-door dis-
cussion.

KEY ELEMENTS

Under the new system. CAS
students will have the option of
either maintaining a 2.0 quality
point average (QPA) or being
expelled from school permanent-
ly with a dishonorable record.

Lee Lawrence: A dramatic read-
ing on elections, the bank of
America, and the weather.

No exceptions will be made
in cases where "less than satis-
factory work" is done.

In another major
new Pitt policy will call for
mandatory attendance at all
classes, even ones for which the
student is not enrolled. Accord-
ing to CAS Dean Jerome D.

not present an excuse signed by
a doctor and their mother will
be required to spend a_ day in

», [picture just after viewing several new movies, premiering at Jake's

 

(Editor's note: Anselmo D’Ascenzo founded the Pitt News in Milan,

 lglfaly, in l873 when it was lost by then editor Dave Tiernan. Meeting later
I ‘in a German pub, D’Ascenzo and Tiernan found much in common and de-

cided to publish jointly a college newspaper. Six months later, Tiernan was

' found stabbed to death with a strand of frozen linguini.)

(Authorities removed the body of the slain editor from a late model

Studebaker found at the bottom of Hudson River. Police investigators dis-
" covered much circumstancial evidence pointing the finger of guilt to D’As-
".cenzo. No arrests were ever made, however, since automobiles were not
_ invented by I873 and the presence of the Studebaker ruined the case
,.against D’Ascenzo.

(D’Ascenzo’s career following the sensational murder of Tiernan was

A clieckiered. He became a war correspondent, covering the often barber-
_ louscampaign of Giuseppe Garabaldi and the infamous “Redshirts." Fol-
‘ lowing the war, he fled to Denmark and married the Crown Princess

'5Mariek_e, who promptly divorced him.

 (Stung by Marieke’s rejection, D’Ascenzo flung himself into work at

‘_ .‘t'he Pitt News and took to drinking heavily. Following almost lOO years
q of writing caustic editorials against the University administration and

ceaseless tippling, D’Asce'nzo’s liver became as poisonous as his pen and

 he died an unheralded death of cirrhosis.

(In this, his first posthumous editorial, D’Ascenzo views the women's

}..»liberation movement and its manifestations for the Pitt News.)

_ Women are rebelling. It’s about time. For centuries, women have
played a subordinate role in our and most every society. Demure. cau-

"__tious, dainty and loving, women have been forced to play nursemaid to

;_the.simian image of the male of the species.

" if Women have too long been viewed as merely sex objects. Perhaps
_ sex is a biological drive that inhers in us all. Perhaps it is an artifically

imposed drive created by the male-dominated society. Perhaps it is

,_‘ not a drive at all, merely the prepubescent dreams of generations of
-_ leering Sweeney’s elevating their night time fantasies to the position
_ of prime mover. .

i The women is,crying out for equality and justice. She deserves the
opportunity for procurement of jobs. She shall have it. She desires

- -the-right the right to bear children at her convenience. She shall have
-—it.. She desires freedom. She Shall have it.

. -Do we grant these things at the Pitt News? You bet your sweet ass

‘ w.e_do. ‘

Here at the Pitt News, we practice a policy of equality and justice

‘between the sexes. There are as many female editors as there are
;_male editors, as many distaff reporters as there are male reporters.
_‘ ‘Stories are assigned without bias.

r Inthis period of reevaluation for American society, we believe it

-’‘_necessary for someone to lead the way. We humbly accept this respon-
 sibility atythe Pitt News. Women at the Pitt News are hired, assigned
a and promoted in the same manner as are men.

Salute To Pittsburgh: Nyaah

by R. RICHARDSON LEAVING

Four years and I29 credits
later, it’s now time for me to say
goodbye to fair Pittsburgh. Jewel
of Appalachia.

Coming from the Boondocks
of Philadelphia (City of tarnished
historical landmarks and irritat-
ing gang wars), Pittsburgh made
a good first impression on me.
Landing at the airport and re-
velling. in the baggage claim
tussles I could sense a quicken-
ing of the pulse. This was a vi-
brant town, a town where things
happen.It was thrilling. Here I
was, one of the hard-driving
cosmopolitan Pittsburghers I‘d
always heard about.

I fought for a cab, and the
driver was nasty. I loved it. (A

‘real Pittsburgh cab driver with

a Lawrenceville accent). We
drove through the ritzy, splitlevel
suburbs of Montour and Carne-
gie, through the tunnels. and
out into the sunlight and the
famous Pittsburgh skyline. There
were the skyscrapers we‘ve all
seen. in movies, and little me
surrounded by the Golden Tri-
angle, “Financial Hub of the
World."

-Quickly ‘we sped down broad
Fifth. Avenue passing through
the quaintly remodelled Hill
District. The road was rather
lumpy in spots, however. “Does-
n’t this road need some paving?”
I asked the driver as my head
took its third shot into the roof.
“Yeah,” he said, “here in duntun
it needs fixed.”

Now I have been educated to
know that those tooth-rattling
lumps are the pride of Pitts-
burgh—its potholes. From thou-

an af-
fectionate goodbye to Pittsburgh.

Author Leaving waves

But my‘first day‘s excitement
was still not at its peak: that
came when I got my first
glimpse of the Cathedral of Learn-
ing gleaming in the sun. Spark-
ling there, an awesome tribute to
Academia. the Cathedral symbol-
ized the University and its world-
wide reputation for intellectual
supremacy. I could imagine the
scores of Nobel Prizewinners in
the Cathedral laboring at their
studies.

I must admit that there were
moments on that first day when
I feared I would not be able to
make the grade; filling the shoes
of Pitt alumni seemed a huge
task. Could 1 match the achieve-
ments (both in college and out of
it) of such great alums as: My-
ron Cope, Marshall Goldberg,
Daniel F. Mosse, and William
“Chilly Billy” Cardille?

Four years and 120 credits
later. I am saddened at the
thought of leaving. Pittsburgh
has given me a sense of the
better life. The list of improve-
ments in my life is a long one:

foamy beverages; I’ve improv-
ed my vocabulary; I’ve learned
to exist on less fresh air; and I‘ve
learned how to belch good.

But I suppose most of all
I have gotten a good education.
It has not been easy. The tough
graders here—Houston, Shostak.
and the rest—have often put the
screws to me at finals time.
But after it's all over I must
thank them for having teached
mealot.

And I should thank the stu-
dents at Pitt even more. What
they say about learning outside
the classroom is true. You
don’t learn anything outside the
classroom.

The Pitt student is a real stu-
ous mixture of different geo-
graphical backgrounds—from the
mills of Monessen to the mills
of Aliquippa; from the Polish
neighborhoods of North Side to
the Polish neighborhoods of
South Side (excuse me, Sah Sahd).
The Pitt student is real stu-
dent. When he’s attending class-
es (if he attends classes) he has
lots of fun. And when he has
fun on weekends he really
works at it.

The Pitt student has added

Not Alone in Fetish

You people deserve high praise for your penetrating exposee on
leather dusters. I am sure that I am not alone in my shocked reaction
to your story concerning Pitt‘s duster fetishists. Such perverts must be
shown for what they are: threats to the American drama. More ex-

Buck-Buckers

It’s spring and that means
were in the middle of buck-
buck season. Looking back on
our 14-10 record so far, and an-
ticipating the close of the sea-
son. 20 games away. we asked
the Panther buck-buck mentor.
Chuck Muncher to sum up his
feelings on the season so far.

When asked about the team's
leaders the coach said that there
were no real leaders and that
the buck—buckers were a close-
knit team.

“I wouldn't say that there are
any real individual standouts.
were real proud of all our boys
and I guess you could say that
we always play the very best
guys that we can."

The coach was asked about
Frank Malzone, the all-Ameri-
can candidate at head buck. The
coach expressed his hopes that
Frank would have a real good
year. “We hope that Frank will
have a real good year, and bar-
ring any injuries he’ll do real
well. He’s a hard-nosed player
with a will to win. We’re real
proud of Frank. He could start
for any one of a half dozen buck-
buck squads but I wouldn’t say
that there are any real individual
standouts I can single out, every-
one does their job.”

In last weekend's cliffhanger
against Faschist State many re-
porters saw officiating as the
mayor cause for the Pitt defeat.
In response to remarks that Fas-
cist "homered“ Pitt, Coach
Muncher said that the officials
were not to blame although some
calls were questionable.

"We were just out-manned and
out-coached. I can't blame the

officials although a few calls
could have gone either way. You
have to remember that the game
isn’t over until the final gun and
that a good defense is the best
offense. If you want it. you can
win it as long as you take the
games one game at a time and
you don't let down for the easy
ones. We were'expecting a real
battle and we got one. You know
you have to play for the win
away, because a tie is like kiss-
ing your sister. Actually the game
had no turning point. but were
real proud of our boys and there
are no real individuals on the
squad that I could single out.

The coach said the buck-buck
squad has done real well so far
this year and that he’s hoping
that, with some luck, they can
win a few more.

“We can win a few more games
this year if we have some luck,
but our buck-buck squad has
done real well so far this year,"
the coach said.

Finally we asked the coach
about freshmen on this year’s team
and the prospects that some real
fine sophs could come up next
year.

“Some real fine sophs could
come up to the varsity next year
and really help our prospects.
They’re a real fine squad, that
freshman squad, and we’re real
proud of them. But there are no
real individuals that I could single
out, and they’re a real close-knit
team that always goes for the
tie because a win is like kissing
your sister and the best offense is
a god offense and barring any
injuries I’d have to say the offi-
cials were not to blame but we’re
real proud of all our, guys.”

Pitt football recruiters have
come up with the recruiting
seasons prize catch—halfback
Jeremy Little of Chicago. Illin-
01S.

Little, who will be eight in
July. was pursued by nearly every
major football power in the na-
tion. Almost all scouts label
Little with a "can‘t miss" tag.

The four feet two. 73 pound
dynamo played offensive and
defensive halfback for the Third
Grade Coed Touch Football Team
of the Cook County Elementary
School. Little. flashy and fast de-
spite his size. dazzled onlookers
throughout the two-game season
with his agility and finesse.

Little also earned the,reputa-
tion of a hard-nosed gutsy play-
er, by never admitting that he
was “tagged” until the teacher
took the ball away from him.

Off the playing field. Litt1e‘s
achievements were nearly renown-
ed as his gridiron glory. This
year, Little was placed on his
school's Honor Roll for the third
time in as many years. Only a
“B” in spelling marred his other-
wise perfect scholastic record.

Pitt head foorball Coach Carl
DePasquale, when asked if he
thought eight-year olds were too
young to be recruited, said that
“ it's never too early to
start a boy on his football ca-
reerf‘

“Hell,” said DePasquale,
“once we teach the kid his left
from his right, he’ll latch on to
our system in no time. It’s not
that different from the one his
Coach now has been using.

Trainer Nabbed Pushing Pills

by ELLIS DEE

Recent developments concern-
ing Joe Bruzzi. a trainer for the
varsity football team have left
officials of the athletic depart-
ment in a mild state of shock.

Two days ago. campus police
nabbed Bruzzi, known to the
athletes as "Sticks." on charges’
of pushing drugs and medica-
tions to players here and at other
schools in the area.

According to a police spokes-
man. the oldest of the athletic
trainers has been using his job
at the University as a coverup fo
his illegal dealings. ‘

9

“It’s all a bum rap,’ counter-
ed Bruzzi after his release on
bond. “Those people are trying
to cut me off from my livli-
hood.” ‘

The coaches from the various
squads were incensed over the
proceedings.

Old man Adams.

known to some as the sourest
man around, summed up the
feelings of most coaches by say-
ing. “He didn‘t even let us in
on it-we could have helped him
and split the profits fairly. In-
stead. he cornered the whole
market himself.“

Athletic Director Cashimir
Sweater. perspiring profusely.
was a little hypo when we spoke
to him. “We found out that most
of the drugs sold were at other
schools and many of their athletes
benefited.“ he related.

“However, the majority of the
teams receiving the drugs never
played our teams.” he continued
in a high pitched voice. “In
fact you could say that they were
out of our league.”

The superintendent of the police
squad was pleased to say "the
undercover dope ring is now shot
to hell."

Evidence to the police was
leaked through stories that shot
putters were shooting puts. and
hurdles were tripping in races.

None of the varsity athletes
would comment on the situation.
but one pole vaulter on the track
team was overheard to remark.
“I never thought that the cops
would look for pushers that high
up."

Authorities are unable to give
an exact date for Bruzzi’s trial
in court.

An indignant Bruzzi. who is
suspended until the case reaches
the courts. expressed his feeling
sarcastically.

“You know how it is," he be-
moaned. “These things get tie
up in a lot of red tape.“ .

Hey Joe, don't you mean ad-
hesive tape? I

Grades 1-5, Inc. said that he
was glad Little had chosen to
come to Pitt.

- “Pitt is a fine school,“ he said.
“and I‘m sure that Jeremy will
do well there. Until he reaches
puberty. there’s no telling how
far he’ll go." 4

DePasquale was unable to
pinpoint Little’s reasons for
choosing Pitt over such name
schools as Notre Dame, Texas,
and USC;

“We made him an awfully
attractive offer." said DePas-
quale.“ but I really couldn't
tell you what his exact reasons
were." ‘

Little‘s parents. who read the

swayed most by DePasquale's I
promise of a Duncan Imperial _
Yo-yo and an erector set.

Little is’ the 13th Panther foot- 
ball recruit this season. Earlier  

‘this week, the Athletic Depart-

 Can’t Stand PAT’_

Transportation Shelters A Bust

Commuter Association (CA)
President Tom Gainsborough to-
day called for “radical action" on
the part of all University com-
muters to thwart what he called
a “calculated plan by the Univer-
sity to eliminate commuters."

Gainsborough’s plea was spark-
ed by today‘s unveiling of two

commuter bus shelters built at

University expense.

While campus luminaries. in-
cluding Gainsborough and Chan-

‘ cellor Posvar, looked on. the cov-

ers were taken from the bus shel-
ters. To the embarrassment of all
present. it was discovered that

THE LONG and the short of it: This bus shelter and another like it, following months of delay, were finally un-

neither of the structures was
large enough to shelter a bus.

“I’m really upset,” fumed
Gainsborough later. “After all
the delays, red tape, and every-
thing that held these shelters up,
you’d think that they’d at least be
built properly. But no, they loused
us up again.”

Gainsborough said that because
of the mistake. commuters would

have no place to park their busses‘

on campus. Gainsborough himself
drives a 71 Negley to and from
campus four or five days a week.

“Not only can we not park" he
said. "but because of it. we're

veiled, and found too short to shelter a bus.

picking up fewer and fewer fares.
We’re losing money besides wast-
ing valuable time looking for park-
ing places."

Gainsborough called upon his
fellow commuters to strike back
at the University. He urged every
commuter who drives a bus to
school to do, so tomorrow and to
park it sideways on Forbes Ave.
between Bigelow Blvd. and Bou-
quet St.

“When they get a load of the
traffic jam we cause." threaten-
ed Gainsborough. “they'll know
we mean business."

Dean is survived by a niece. Dr. Konnilyn Feig of Pittsburgh. and
two cousins. William Markus and Robert Gallagher. both of Pittsburgh.

According to Attorney Bernard Kobosky. executor of the will. there

. MICHAEL C. MILLER
Michael C. Miller. prominent Pittsburgh attorney. died today in

Mercy Hospital. after being run over by a Port Authority bus on Fifth

Miller had stepped off the curb to hail the driver when the accident’:
occurred. The bus was an express. which doesn‘t stop for anything and
didn’t stop for Miller either.

The deceased. 25 years old. resided with his parents at 121 Cam-
bridge Road in Bethel Park.

A graduate of the University of
Pittsburgh. Miller studied law at
Harvard Law School and became
partner in the law firm of Wil-

year.

Miller is survived by his par-
ents. Mildred and Charles Miller.

el Park.

Millers brief but illustrious ca-
reer was highlighted by his de-
fense of Edward Conley, accused
of more than a score of ax mur-
ders in the South Hills area. Miller lost the case.

Friends will be received today a-nd tomorrow at the Sleep Well
Funeral Home at 567 Fort Couch Rd. in Bethel Park from 2-4 p.m.
and again from 7-9 p.m.

DANIEL’ S REALTY CO.

I .

 

I Attacker Clawed
In Real Bra-Haha

Falling prey to two female ka-
rate experts. Samuel Simpleton.
newly-hired maintenance expert.
was brutally molested after mak-
ing his illegal entry into Amos
Hall.

Responsible for his capture
were Mary Orchid and Chris
Crowstream. Inspector Surelic
Homes. officer in charge. report-
ed. “A most heroic feet has been
performed on campus. It appears
that Simpleton went berserk
when he saw a bra hanging from a
window in the dormitory. The
girls that captured him should be
given the Oustanding Citizenship
Award for Bra-vary.

“It appears Simpleton entered
the dorm while the security desk
personal stepped out to relieve
himself.“ sheepishly commented
Homes.

While studying in her room,
Mary’s roommate, Chris, was
washing her delicate lingerie. She
returned to the room and placed
the clothing near the window to
dry. When asked how she felt
about the incident, Christ smirk-
ingly said, “I never thought that
my bra would make a man go
wild!”

After hanging the undergar-
ments on the window. Chris went
to the lounge to watch television.
Mary sat alone in the room——the
door unlocked.

Chris sat enjoying “Godzilla vs.
Tinkerbell“ as Samuel Simpleton
walked in the main lobby. He
climbed the five flights unnoticed
and headed toward the room.

Mary heard footsteps, but did
not bother to look up from her
work. “I continued studying.

‘ Without looking up I asked Chris

if she was finished with her laun-
dry. When she didn’t answer, I
turned around and looked toward
the door.

“That ghastly man was stand-
ing in the doorway. His eyes were
glassy and his mouth was drool-
ing. 1 opened my mouth to scream
just as he picked up Chris’ Funk
& Wagnall’s and threw it at me.“
Mary explained.

3; Hearing Mary's screams. Chris

ran to the room to find Simpleton
clutching her red bra in his hand.
Using the finesse of four years
of karate training. Chris kicked.
scratched. and bit the man un-
mercifully.

His head was bleeding profuse-
ly where Chris had bitten him. As
he writhed in pain, he clutched the
red bra to his heart.

Simpletons ex-wife. a chewing
gum factory worker. reported
later. "That SOB had a special
thing for red. He insisted that I
wear red underwear at all times.
When I refused to as he asked. he
beat me. So I left the dirty punk."

When the police arrived. Sim-
pleton was crying because the
girls had taken the bra from him.

He was given a tranquilizer to

calm him.

After securing him in the psy-
chiatric ward at Western Psych,
preliminary tests were run. Dr.
Sigdun Duerf, attending physi-
cian commented on Simpleton’s
condition.

“It appears that he owned a red
raggety Andy as a child. The doll
represented security. love. and
understanding. Because the doll
was no longer in his possession.
the color red replaced it." he said.

John Vernon. director of Hous-
ing. commented that the entire
staff felt Simpletons loss. "We
hope that he surpasses this small
difficulty and can report back to
work very soon.

WARNING!

Tomorrow morning when you
reach for that bottle of Lister-
ine stop and read the label, es-
pecially the part that says

“Kills germs on contact by mil-
|ions" Think about it. . .Do
you want something to die in
