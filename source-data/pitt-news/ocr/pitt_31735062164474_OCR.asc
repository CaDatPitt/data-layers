Al Schlosser To Speak at Tap Day 
\71-ana Reviews SG Program to Add More Meaning; 
Election Procedure Honoraries to Construct Displays

 

By JACK! KATZ
\' John Vrana, Student Gov-
ernment (SG) president, re-
viewed the procedure for
this year’s SG elections Feb.
24 at the Student Affairs
Committee meeting Tuesday.
Several changes have been

made to make voting easier -

for the students, according

to Vrana.
Rather than have .all the can-

' didates for senatorial positions
listed on one ballot, there will be
ﬁve separate ballots — one for
each undergraduate school: Lib-
eral Arts, Engineering and Mines,
Education, Pharmacy, and Nurs-

,».. ing-
‘ ‘s was initiated because
last year some students voted for
.candidates in schools other than
their own because all the candi-
dates were listed on the same
ballo ,” Vrana explained. “All of
these ballots had to be disquali-
ﬁed.”

In addition, a three man com-
mittee was formed to review any
election violations if the election
committee requests such a re-
view. The members of this'com-
mittee are Mrs. Erma Meyerson,
professor of social work’ and a
new faculty committee member
of Student Affairs; Ron Cimino,

vice-president of SG; and Faith
Leitzel, president of Associated
Women Students.

Voting will take place from
9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. Feb. 24 in
the Towers, Cathedral, Engineer-
ing Hall, and Scaife Hall. Regular
voting booths will be set up in
the Towers and the Cathedral.
Students will be required to show
a validated invoice, indicating
that they are full-time students
before they will be allowed to
vote.

Also students must sign the
election book which contains
every student's name. The book
was provided by“the Data Pro-
cessing Center.

Vrana also explained that bal-
lots will be disqualiﬁed if they
contain erasures or stray marks.
“Students can only vote for the
number allowed from their
school,” Vrana said. “For in-
stance, this year Liberal Art stu-
dents will be allowed to vote for
14 senators. If any student votes
for more than .14, their "ballot
will be disqualiﬁed."

Following the Student Affairs
meeting, the steering committee

cuss the best way to communi-

Class Time Schedule

Receives Comment

By MARSHA REHNS .

The recently published time schedule of classes for the
Spring Trimester has drawn complaints from students wish-
to attend classes during the third term. According to An-
thony Athens, assistant registrar of student records, how-
ever, the number of courses being offered is identical to or
more than last year’s offering. 7

The omission of Biology 15- from the list of spring
offerings/ raised the greatest discontent among possible
biology majors. The ﬁve—credit course is a prerequisite to
all succeeding biology courses. _

Dr. Frederick Gottlieb, assistant professor of biology,
explained that offering the course this trimester required
keeping the laboratories open from 8 a.m. until 10 p.m. four
days a week. “Offering the course two trimester in a row is

beyond human endurance,” he continued. “Last week we
had to ﬁll 8,000 Petri dishes. Be-
sides some live organisms don’t

The committee, consisting of
Harvey Lefton, Dorrie Brand, and
Lenny Schwartz, asked that the
library be open until 11 p.m.
during the week and from noon
until 10 p.m. on Sundays. At pre-

He further commented that
teaching the course would neces-
sitate bringing in a new man. An-

other science professor added
that Biology 15 is the most ex-
pensive course in the ﬁeld and
budget cuts do not permit it be-
ing offered. The course will, how-
ever, be available in the fall and

Allan Schlosser, senior political science major and a“ ‘I:
news editor of The Pitt News, will be the principal speaker . 

for Tap Day, March 3 in the Student Union Ballroom.

Schlosser, who Was also the chairman of Citizens for-Vii

J ohnson.-Humphrey, will speak on the meaning of the stu-

dent demonstration at the University of California at Berk- g 

eley. Ceremonies begin at 4 p.m.
Tap Day will have a new touch this year. Chairman Beverley

Reifman said ceremonies will be conducted more personally and  
more publically than ever before to make the day more meaningful __*~j_

and interesting.
As part of the reform, each tappee will be tapped individually

before 4 p.m. on Tap Day, with tappees to large honoraries being L 

notiﬁed by letter the day before.

The Tap Day Committee has also asked each honorary to con-
struct a display similar to the wooden key which Omicron Delta
Kappa (ODK) erects each year.

Displays will be situated along the walk leading to the Cathedral.
When all have been tapped, there names will be placed on the dis-
plays. Smaller displays will be placed in the Student Union before
11 a.m. by organizations which cannot afford the larger ones..

During the ceremonies, the Top Day Committee will give i_n- ’

dividual awards to Mr. and Miss Pitt, Senior Worthies, the OD]! Man

of the Year, the Sophomore Man of the Year, and winners of various I 

individual honorary awards. Awards for study abroad will also be
presented at that time.

Following the ceremonies, a reception in honor of the new tap-
pees and award winners will be held in the Student Union lower
lounge. Faculty, administration and the student body may attend.

The reception will be followed by a dinner for the individual
award winners.

Spring Schedule Limits Hurt  
Language Grad Assistants

The University’s assertion that
the recent budget cut would in
no way affect the academic pro-
gram seemingly has been con-
tradicted. The new Spring Tri-
mester schedule has gravely af-
fected the language department,
especially the graduate assistants.

Due ‘to the scheduling of only
one graduate course in both
French and Spanish, assistants
are prevented from utilizing the
contract for one-half residence
grants. These grants specify that
students must take two required
courses and teach two other ones,
but these conditions cannot pos-
sibly be fulﬁlled under the pro-
gram outlined for the Spring Tri-
mester.

One graduate assistant spoke
of the cut as violating “the ethi-

ﬂ cal commitment of the adminis-

ed on television programs. As

tration to help us get our degree
as long as our work is satisfac-
tory.

The outline for the Spring Tri-
mester calls for one graduate as-
sistant in French and another in

Spanish. This automatically elim-

inates some 30 assistants." Al-
though there is always a sub-
stantial drop in numbers dur-
ing the Spring trimester, one as-

sistant pointed out that “anyone .

who wanted to go this trimester
was able to do so.”

Most of the graduate assistants

had turned down two or three’

grant offers apiece in their pre-
ference for the University, even
though the University “crowds 49
assistants in an office with only
four desks and one telephone,”
an assistant remarked.

Pittsburgh Symphony

 

By JAY AZNEER
Carlo Maria Giulini, guest
conductor of the Pittsburgh
Symphony this week, has
programed this pair of con-
certs chronologically. In
keeping with this unimagin-
ative approach to program-
ming, Guilini has chosen
some very unimaginative
pieces.

The “Overture to ‘Semiramde”’
by Rossini is a very entertaining
piece of music, however, its mu-
sical content would hardly seem
to justify its popularity.

Following the Rossini is the

It has been said that Italy was
the cradle of instrumental music
and that instrumental music in
Italy has been in the cradle ever
since. Ghedini is typical of this
tradition. He was active in the
early part of this century and
like so many of his contempor-
aries, such as Alfano and Maruc-
ci, his work is pleasantry remin-
iscent of an era that had passed.
Today, in the light of musical
development in the last 50 years,

his music has the bittersweet
quality of having been written by
a man who was born too late.

of Public and International Af-
fairs (GSPIA) have been short-
ened slightly after review of its
library use. Dr. Donald Stone,
dean of GSPIA, said the aim is
to have the library most accessi-
ble when the students want to
use it.

“We aren’t justiﬁed economi-
cally to have the library open
when only one, two, or a few
persons are using it,” Dean Stone
said.

The new hours for the GSPIA
library are 8:30 a.m. to 10 p.m.
Monday through Thursday, 8:30
a.m. to 6 p.m_ Friday, 10 a.m. to
6 p.m. Saturday, and 1 to 4 p.m.
Sunday. In addition to shorten-

ing the evening hours, the Sun- .

day‘ hours were shortened.

One of the GSPIA librarians
commented that the change was
“mostly a matter of ﬁnances. We
needed more staff members dur-
ing the week days because of in-
creased circulation and we could-
n’t afford to have the library
open all the time on the week-
ends as well.”

Dean Lancour gave the reason
for the shortening of the hours
as due to Frank McGowan, li-
brary instructor at, GSPIA, going

' to Ecuador to work with the Uni-

versity project there. “We haven’t
been able to get adequate help
yet,” he said.

oer cent of those who entered
:eived their bachelor’s or ﬁrst

years. Large percentages of

ulty _is .another reason for early
dropout or transfer. According to
Iffert, “It is inescapable that
qualitatively as well as quantita-
tively, faculties are very impor-
tant agents in the "determination
of undergraduate attrition rates."

A third signiﬁcant cause for
drop outs rests with the student
who never had sufficient prepara-
tion to enter college, but had
been pressured to do so.

Data suggests, that, not only
do a large percentage of drop-
outs return to school, but drop-
ping out sometimes has been a
potentially proﬁtable experience
for the student, resulting in im-
mediate and long-term positive
eﬂfects.

In order to deal with students
for whom ‘dropping out is not
beneﬁcial, it was proposed that
.a deeper understandingofthe stu-
dent’s perception of college and
how to cope with it is needed.

The suggestion is that this un-
derstanding might be most effec-
tual in guiding those students who
have talent which has either
been uncultivated or suppressed.
An additional proposal advocated
the sharpening of admissions cri-
terion in order that more valid
matches between student and
‘university be effected.

Bartok Stays Cheerfu1Behind SU Desk

By MARSHA REHNS

“I crack a joke to make
life a little cheerier for oth-
er people. I know that if I
am a clown that I can make
friends.” This is Fred Bar-
tok to anyone who comes in
contact with him during the
18 -20 hours per week he
spends behind the Student

Union desk.

Pipe in hand, Fred succeeds in
creating his image of a jester;
yet when he came to the Uni-
versity from the J 0hI1St0W11 Cam‘
pus two years ago, he felt “very
out of it; like running around in
a maze,” He found the Universi-
ty just a mass of stone and asked
himself, “Where the hell are you
going?” He turned to speech as a
major possibly leading to a law
degree. Speech courses gave him
the opportunity to “pick up know-
ledge and say what he wanted
to on any subject.”

Fred complained that his ad-
vising had been inadequate at
Johnstown and that many trans-
fer students ﬁnd they end up
taking the wrong courses or
courses they don’t like. He also
found that cheating on campus
made it hard to get ahead.

“You are getting lousy grades
and competing with the frater-
nity foul system (test ﬁles, Da-
pers, etc.) so that in applying to
graduate school your marks don’t
show up well by comparison. Peo-
ple are so worried about getting
ahead that they don’t think it’s
wrong to cheat.

“The worst thing about the
University is too many students
without a liberal education,” he
judged and added that not enough
people take advantage of their
professors’ knowledge or of the
opportunities in Pittsburgh, such
as Carnegie Museum.

Analyzing The Situation

‘.

 By Karen Woolf

The most basic problem that faces the

University of Pittsburgh today is the ten- P

sion which exists "between the effort to
educate several thousand undergraduate
students and to educate them well. The fact
that the Psychology Department has been
forced to discount the results of an exam-
ination because of cheating is evidence that
we have failed to resolve this tension.

We must face the reality that mass edu-
cation at the college level is here to stay.
Greater and greater numbers of people will
Want college degrees in the future and from
all indications institutions of higher learn-
ing are willing, if not yet ready, to admit
those who qualify. Since mass education
is inevitable we are left with two alterna-

tives in order to resolve the tension be- .

tween mass and good education.

WE CAN IGNORE the potential of un-
dergraduate students and concentrate upon
the proven capabilities of graduate stu-
dents, or we can make a renewed effort to

: lmaintain standards of excellence for each

undergraduate. The choice, however, is not
so obvious as itappears at ﬁrst glance.
The simplest way out would be to ignore
the education of the undergraduate. A
“good education” would be removed to a
higher educational level and colleges would
continue to reflect a dominant value of

‘ American society, “easy-way-outism.” Yet

students are in large part the product of
this environment.

After all, why should the values of un-
dergraduates be any different from the
dominant values of the society, and what
assurance is there that the values of gradu-
ate students will be any different? There
is no answer to either question; only an
unsatisfactory value judgement which goes
something like, “Because they should. . . ”

It is obvious that Pitt doesn’t intend to
ignore the problem presented by undergrad-
uates who cheat. But if we don’t intend to

’ ignore cheating, what do we intend to do

about it? At the present time a variety of
actions have been taken: a failing grade;

 

a warning; referral to the Dean of Stu-
dents; and referral to the academic dean.
It is apparent that in each case the instruc-
tor was unsure of the necessary action.

The ” following are some concrete sug-
gestions:

(1) AN EFFORT should be made by in-
structors of large lecture classes to elimin-
ate true-false and multiple choice tests.
These examinations test neither the stu-
dent's ability to conceptualize nor his cre-
ativity, and they facilitate cheating.

Furthermore, machine-marked examina-
tions of this type are not absolutely neces-
sary in large lectures. Instead of three or
four multiple choice tests, the grades of
which are posted by the next class meeting
for all to see, two essay tests and a ﬁnal
could be given in lecture and the results of
the ﬁrst two could be discussed in recita-
tion or lecture.

Each student would then have the op-
portunity to keep his grade a secret and to
beneﬁt from a class discussion of the exam-
inations.

(2) A COMMITTEE composed of the
Presidents of Student Government, Associ-
ated Women Students, Men’s Council, Stu-
dent Union Board, the Editor of The Pitt
News, the academic Deans, the Dean of
Women, and the Dean of Men, should pre-
pare a deﬁnition of cheating as it occurs on
tests, in term-papers, and in laboratory
experiments.

(3) THIS COMMITTEE should decide
and publicize the action that is to be taken
when cheating has occurred. .

The above suggestions will not resolve
the tension between mass education and
good education. They may, however, estab-
lish a solid foundation for future action at
Pitt. Students who are used to taking the
easy way out are powerful enemies of good
education. While the conﬂict proves very
interesting, it is probably a never-ending
battle which ﬁames up sporadically and
soon becomes borning.

 

    
 

  
  
    
  
  

 

Coeds Defend
Senior Assts. .

‘Editor, The Pitt News:

In response to the letter in The

“Pitt News, Feb. 8, charging the

senior assistants with abuse of

=their powers, we wish to state

that the opinion of the majority
of girls does not coincide with

the complaint in the letter.

The job "of a senior assistant is

\ not easy. She acts as a guide, not

a policeman, for 62 girls. Our

I . senior assistants always have

their doors open at any hour to
hear any problems we may have.

They have never refused to
talk to anyone no matter how

,_‘ much work they have. In fact,
‘ — they do things for us, They plan
parties for us, they send us‘

ﬂowers and candy on our birth-
days, and they decorate the

A dorms for the holidays.

There is another side of the
senior assistants, which is un-
pleasant for all concerned—-dis-
cipline. Surely, girls are cam-

pused, but on our ﬂoor only six ’

campuses have been given since
September. These have been giv-
en out only after sufficient warn-
ing, and as far as the majority of
the girls is concerned, they are

‘ well deserved.

The position of the girls’ rooms
 relation to the senior assis-
tant’s does not really matter. The

If girls who live across the hall
 from the Senior assistants are
 more likely to be heard, but they
' also receive more warnings.

Wé would like to say that what

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

was printed in The Pitt News was
entirely one-sided. It was the
opinion of girls who have been
punished and deserved it.

For Psych Profs

Editor, The Pitt News:

In lieu of spending hours of
time and monumental moments
of effort in preparing new mul-
tiple choice tests and guarding
them with the proﬁciency of CIA
agents, I would commend Drs.
Orgul and Moskowitz (of Psy-
chology 80 fame) as well as their
“dedicated” graduate students
the possibility of preparing an
adequate and vaguely signiﬁcant
examination with the proﬁciency
of educators.

Cheating Not
Fault of Society

Editor, The Pitt News:

I am writing in response to
Fred Pollack’s articulate letter.
He writes that society at large is
responsible for cheating in all its
aspects. Possibly such a theory
explains the prevalence of cheat-
ing and helps us understand it. I

do not think, with all due respect a

to Fred Pollack, that it is an ade-

 

quate excuse for an individual to
use to explain his actions.

Maybe, if we were to make a
statistical analysis of success
stories most would be found to
be dependent on fraud. I think
that we would also ﬁnd a large
minority who succeeded honestly.

Contrary to Fred Pollack’s
thinking, I do not believe the an-
swer lies in a thorough investiga-
tion of society. Besides the im-
practicality, in constantly chang-
ing societies I do not think it
possible to pinpoint deﬁnite
trends let alone satisfactorily
change them. And if accomplish-
ed, who would perform the awe-
some moral task of reform?

I believe a solution (if there
is any) lies in the individual, to
be discovered through self-intro-
spection (maintaining one’s per-
spective as to one’s position in
society) rather than through com-
munal-introspection.

‘ Down at Joe’s Bar

Everybody was down at Joe’s Bar last Saturday just
sort of sitting around and talking when one of the fellas
noticed his beer glass was dirty. “Hey, Joe,” he said. “What
sa matter. Don’t ya wash your glasses anymore?”

Joe, the bartender and owner, glanced up from drawing
a beer. “We’re on an economy drive around here,” he said.
“We only Wash them every other beer, now. Have to cut
down on water and soap suds... Dirties a_lot of dish cloths,
too, washing and drying all the time. Nope. We’re just cut-

  .__.. g  .,  -down on a lotta. services, that’s
“How about your kitchen helper ?”
“Hadda get rid of him,’ said Joe.
“And Sally the cook, too. Can’t afford
to have them around.”
“Business bad, huh?”

“NOT THAT. Just that I tried to
do too much at once, that’s all. Things
were ﬁne until I decided to build the
barroom annex. But when I started
_ that I Went into thehole. I just don’t
~‘   have any more money to play around

JANEIC with, that’s all.”

The customer looked into his beer. “Guess it kinda
shocked ya, runnin’ out of money.”

“Na. I really should have expected it. You can’t expand
like I’ve been doing and not expect some trouble. And a lot
of my relatives aren’t coming around much anymore and
this hurt business. They were pretty, good spenders. I'm
not mad at anybody or blaming anyone. But it’s no fun,
I’ll tell you tha .”

“What are you going to do, close down?”

“NO. THINGS are serious, but it’s not a catastrophe.
We'll manage. We’ll just cut down on the unimportant
things, that’s all. No more sweeping under booths and bar
stools. No more changing burned out light bulbs. I figure
I’ll only wipe off the bar once a day and just keep the neon
light on for a couple of hours at night. And I won’t pay ole
Clem to shovel snow anymore. In time this ought to set me
on my feet again. Then I’ll start the annex again and maybe
hire back some of the help.”

“Is this gonna affect building your new garage?”

“No. Sue and I already had money put aside for that.
There will be no problem there. But We can’t start building
the outdoor barbecue like I’d planned. I’ll have to shelve
that.”

“How do you ﬁgure you’ll get back on your feet, Joe ?”.

“OH, MY UNCLES and brothers and I are having a.
meeting this week and We’ll think of something. We’ve
already closed my alligator farm upstate because it’s obso-
lete. But my cousin wants to ﬁnance it for awhile so I sup-
pose I’ll let him.”

“Hey, listen Joe. I’m sorry I got mad about the dirty

   

I glass. I didn't realize things Were that bad.”

“Oh that’s okay. Hey. How about taking your feet off
the brass rail. We just cleaned it last week.”

The doorbell of the old gray stone Ora-
tory rings. Almost immediately blue-eyed

  

Father Philip Walsh opens the door and
takes the mail from the box. Tradva, a
part-time dachshund, romps after the priest
with tail wagging and ears flopping. '

As they return through the modern front room 7
into the study their feet sink into the soft ‘red ‘

carpet. Father Walsh makes himself comfortable in
his rocker and resumes his discussion with a grad-
uate student in physics aboutsthe inter-faith study
committee.

Here at 4040 Bigelow Ave. ‘the new spirit of
Catholicism is being born on the University of
Pittsburgh campus. The gray uneven blocks of the
Oratory contrast their surroundings like the Ca-
thedral of Learning would contrast the downtown
Hilton Hotel if they were justa-posed. “But,” Fath-
er Walsh clarifies, - “Just like the Cathedral of
Learning, the Oratory is a symbol.”

The Oratory is a working symbol, staffed by
four priests who voluntarily follow the rule of
prayer and discipline laid down by Saint Philip
Neri of Florence in the 16th century.

The Oratory was founded in 1961 by Bishop
John J. Wright specifically to save the graduates,
undergraduates and faculties of the University,
Carnegie Institute of Technology and Chatham
College.

Other intellectual activities of the Oratory in-
clude forums, which are open to members of any

   

Taiza, France, who spoke on the Commllllicatien
of Theology.

Retreats, so named because they are a with-
drawing from worldly matters for the purpose of
introspection, provide longer periods of silence and
prayer and more concentrated discussion and,
growth, Father Walsh explains.

Now, more than any time before, the work
of university men and women will determine our
common future, Father Walsh claims. “That is why,
more than ever, a university must exist as a
place for opening towards all that concerns man
and his world,” he explains. “But one cannot long
be open to men without daily turning towards
God.”

“To understand this is to understand why
John Henry Newman conceived the idea of a. Uni-
versity Oratory, “says Father Walsh, “The future
Cardinal attempted the foundation of an oratory
at Oxford in 1865, when he was head of the 01'3-
tory of Birmingham. '

Although never realized, the idea was sim-
ple: a group of men dedicated to a life of prayer
and love and work for God and man, remaining at
one university for life . . . a place and a com-
munity with tradition and attachment deepening
through the years. Our University’s Oratory is just

 

such an undertaking.” ‘ I _

THE JACK MARIN STORY—Part II

T BOB TIMMONS was so interested in Jack Marin that he

slept in the morning the Marins came to Pittsburgh to meet
him. Timmons says that was the day the clocks were
changed for daylight savings time, and he forgot to
set the clocks back. That’s how important Jack Marin

wastohim.

Although J ack’s father Steve says Timmons never
called back, 'I‘immons says he called the next day to

BOB THHMONS
Slept in.

. invite him back to Pitts

burgh. “At that time,” Tim-
mons said, “he told me that
he was already pretty sold
on Duke.”

MR. MARIN says that it
was two weeks later before
Jack even saw Durham,
North Carolina. “It wasn’t
until then that _Jack decided
to go to Duke,” Mr. Marin
said.

“Before that,” Mr. Marin
continued, “Pitt definitely
had the inside track.”

Timmons does admit,
however, that Jack Marin

would have been an asset to ‘

the basketball team. “He’s a
real good player,” Timmons
said, “and that makes a lot
of difference. He’s a real

scoring threat, and he's a
tremendous shot. But like I

said, he was already pretty sold on Duke.”
Timmons says that it’s all history now. So is the
basketball team’s 5-11 record.

# #

THE COMPOSITE record of the ‘winter sports teams is
18-32. The wrestling team, 4-3, and the track team, 2-1, are
the only teams above .500 . . . Part of the reason for the

lack of popularity of college basketball is its treatment

in the downtown papers. One newspaper recently de-
voted two big articles to high school basketball, while

. covering the collegiate activity in one seven inch story.

In the sports program listings on the same page,

they listed a McKeesport High basketball game ﬁrst.
Three listings later they listedthe Duquesne basketball

game.

Frosh Journey to Johnstown

weeks ago. The Cubs defeated
Point Park last Monday for their
second win over them this sea-
3011.

Ken Bollens led the Cuba with
18 points in that game. Frank

’ Famularo chipped in 17-"-his sea-

son high. The team’s record is
three and eight but many people,

including the Duquesne freshman

coach, have called it “mislead-
- ins.”

Cub coach Carl Peterson has al-

’ ways said that the opposing teams

“aren’t that much better than us.
It's been as much bad luck as
anything else.”

   Seeking Second Straight Win

The. freshman basketball team trys for its second win
in a row as it travels to J ohnstown tomorrow to meet the

BOB LOVETI.‘ (22)
Fights for a. Rebound.

No. Carolina

1 1am

   

 

Coach Bob Timmons foresees no quick solution to the
basketball team’s troubles, when the hoopsters play at Wil-

liam and Mary tomorrow.

“I really do not know much about them,” said Timmons,
“because I haven’t seen them play. But they’re bigger and
stronger than us, and I anticipate trouble.”

Rebounding and a poor shoot-
ing percentage have plagued the
hoopsters all year, and the In-
dians have the talent to take ad-
vantage of these faults.

Bob Lovett leads the hoopsters
in rebounding with a 8.2 aver-
age, but his rebounding is dwarf-
ed by the tremendous height of
the Indians. Forwards Marty
Morris and Ben Pomeroy are six-

. feet six-inches each, and center

Lou Ollice is six-feet seven-inch-
es. The Indians starting quintet
also averages two-and-one-half
inches taller than the Panthers.

Although the hoopsters have
three men averaging 14 points,
the other two starters are only
averaging six points. William and
Mary. however, has four men
averaging 11 points or better, and
their ﬁfth man averages nine
points.

Morris paces the Indians with
a 16 point average, and guards

Tim Walter and Walter Wenk.-

average 12 points each. Panther
guards, however, present a scor-
ing imbalance,

“Too Deep”

For Mermen, Says Grady I
The swimming team meets powerful North Carolina

State tomorrow at North Carolina State. The swimmers
won their ﬁrst meet by defeating Syracuse Saturday, and

now have a 1-4 record.

Although the swimmers won a meet, they still lack
depth. “We’re hurting,” said coach. Ben Grady. “We just
do not have the depth this year, while everyone else is just

loaded with talent._Al1 our meets
are tough, and we face a very
strong North Carolina State to-
morrow.”

The Wolfpack boasts Atlantic
Coast Conference freestyle cham-

pion Pat Gavaghan and ACCb

backstroke champ Dick Paoletti.
Besides Gavaghan and Paoletti,
their lineup includes four out-
standing sophomores.

Sophomores’ Ron Worth, John
White, and John Harvey aid Gav-
aghan in the freestyle events,
while sophomore Rick Hillegas
swims the breaststroke. Worth
was an All-American in school.

Don Loomis, Ed. Broadhurst,
and Scott Howard give the Wolf-
pack more depth in the freestyle

events, while John Bermeulen ex-
cels in the butterﬂy.

“We can not even ﬁgure on
taking any ﬁrst or seconds this
week,” said Grady. “They’re just
too tough.” The swimmers con-
clude their season next week
against the 1964 small -college
champ Bucknell.

 
    

Tracksters
Ready for
Final Meet

The track team travels to Anna-
polis tomorrow for the ﬁnal in-
door meet of the season with
Navy, The. meet will begin at
3:30 p.m.

After losing to Army last week,
a victory over Navy would be a
major upset, since the Middies
are rated better than the Cadets.
“As usual, Navy will have a
large squad and will be stronger
in the running than Army,” said
Coach Carl Rees. “The Midship-
men have exceptional mile and
two mile runners,” continued
Rees, “our runners will have
their ﬁrst real tes .”

"By JAY ROSENSTEIN
Freshman basketball star
Ken Bollens’ only fault is
that he doesn’t shoot enough.
He excels everywhere else.

“Sometimes he’s afraid to
shoot,” said coach Carl Pet-
erson. “We want him to take
the shot after he makes his
fake, but he hesitates and
loses his advantage.”

Varsity coach Bob Timmons
voiced his conﬁdence in Bollens.
“We plan to move him into
Daryle Ruby’s spot,” Timmons
said, “He has the scoring ability
and the good inside moves we

vg, need. His rebounding is more

than adequate, his movements
are quick, and he hustles all the
tilneja

Bollens’ hustling has netted
him a /22 point game average
for the Cubs. It’s about the same
that he averaged for North Hills
High 'School where he was the
ﬁrst player in the history of the
school to score over 1,000 points
during his varsity career.

“I remember when they stop-
ped the game and gave me the
ball after that 1,000th point,” said
Bollens-. “But I never scored 30
points in any game until I got

 Gym Squad

In View of
Good Year

The gyrrmastics team has its
ﬁrst chance in many years to end
up with a winning season. As a
result, the popularity of the sport
has shown a marked increase.

The gymnasts now hold a 3-4
record with three meets remain-
ing — West Virginia, Temple and
Georgia Tech. The Mountaineers
will be the Field House Saturday,
February 20, at 2 pm

“I’d say that we have a pretty
good ‘chance of beating Tech,
West Virginia and Temple in that
order,” said coach Warren N eiger.
“We were underdogs against

‘ Navy and we beat them due to
an amazing team effort. Every
130)’ came through in his perform-
ance. I hardly remember a slip-
up.”

Bollens Paces Cub Cagers

the" 36 points against Steuben- .

ville last month. That was a big
thrill for me.” Despite his efforts
the Cubs lost, 80-66,

Peterson notes that the other
teams have been pointing to Bol-
lens. “Dave Holmes of West Vir-
ginia played him very tight. He
dogged him all over the court.”
Bollens still scored 21 points
while playing only half the game.

Echoing what Timmons said,
Peterson observes that “Bollens
is a hard worker with the right
kind of attitude. The only way he
knows how to play is with
100 per cent eﬂort. He’s very
coachable —— always wants to»
improve.”

Bollens feels that his weakness
is defense, “I give the baseline,”
he says. “Guys throw a fake and
drive right around me. Then I
have to foul to prevent the
basket.”

Peterson, however, disagrees.
“Ken’s a good defensive ballplay-
er. We wouldn’t hesitate to put
him on a strong offensive play-
er. The trouble is that in order
to be good on defense .a boy has
to be aggressive, and aggressive
players commit fouls. We can’t
afford to let Bollens get into foul
trouble.”

He has gotten into foul trou-
ble in several games and it has
hurt the Cubs. He fouled out
with ten minutes to go in the re-
cent West Virginia game.

Offensively. Bollens shows that
he has ball-handling ability, even
in leading a fast break. One prob-
lem that he does seem to have
is leaving his feet after a pass,

Timmons is . . .

crashing into the defensive man,
and drawing the charging foul.
Peterson says that with experi-
.ence Bollens will play it cooler
when the Panthers are in scor-
ing range.

“I’m looking forward to play-
ing varsity ball,” said Bollens. “I
enjoy playing the comer spot and
maybe with more fans at the
games my play could improve.”
Coach Timmons will no doubt
enjoy having the 6-4, 785 pounder
play forward many times in the
next three years.

Big Red

The wrestling team faces the ﬁrst of three Eastern
collegiate powers tomorrow when they wrestle at Cornell.
Both teams have .555 winning percentages, the Wrestlers
being 4-3, and Cornell having a 6-5 mark.

Cornell poses a young, well-balanced lineup, and its
losses have been to major powers: Lehigh, Navy, Michigan,

Penn State, and Iowa State.
Junior Jeff Stephens leads a

Cornell starting lineup having
four sophomores, four juniors,
and one senior, Stephen’s 9-2 rec-
ord in the 167-weight class in-
cludes a 3-0 decision of Michi-
gan star Rick Bay.

Mike Johnson faces Cornell
captain Neal Orr in the 130-
pound match. Orr poses a 9-2 rec-
ord, becoming Johnson’s best op-
ponent this season. ‘

The return of starters Clear-
ence Buchwald (191), Joe De-
Meo, (147). and Fran Ferraro
(177) strengthen Cornell’s attack.
All three were academically in-
eligible last semester, but wrestle
their ﬁrst matches tomorrow. Fer-
raro and Buchwald were among
Cornell’s top ﬁve wrestlers last
year.

Tomorrow

By BILL CABIN

“Cornell will deﬁnitely provide
better competition than we had
last year,” said coach Rex Peery.

“They’ve got good wrestlers in
the 191 and heavyweight divi-
sions,” Peery added in disgust.

Wrestlers Bill Bodle and Bill
Beck have won a combined total
of one match of seven in those
divisions.

The Big Red, however, have
good wrestlers in all weights, ex-
cept the 137-pound division. Tom
Heniﬁ opposes Cornell sopho-
more Bob Stock in the 123-pound
match, and Tom Baily wrestles
sophomore Mike Agone in the
157-pound match.

Gymnastics is usually thought
of as a sport of individual per-
formers. The opposite was true
last Saturday. Going into the
ﬁnal event, still rings, the Pan-
thers led by only one point, Dave
McKinnis took second and Jim
Sacco and lg Perez tied for third
to settle the meet.

“I think many of the fans went
away impressed,” said Neiger.
Sacco, who has spent ﬁve years
developing routines, feels the
same way. “Most people who
come to see a meet go away lik-
‘« ing it. Unless you watch a gym-
nastics meet you have no idea
of what it really is.”

“It’s a hard sport to under-
stand,” added Perez. “People just
don’t seem to understand all the
intricacies and hard work that
goes into each little effort. We'll
never have turnouts like Penn
State because Pitt students would
rather do something else than
