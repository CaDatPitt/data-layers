University
sponsored
event leads

to law suit

By Jack Finn

Asst. News Editor

A Pitt-sponsored seminar, featur-
ing the latest technological
advances for the disabled," resulted
in a lawsuit filed in federal court
because the event was allegedly
inaccessible to wheelchairs-

The Greentree Holida_y Inn,
Pittsburgh Rehabilitati_on Institute,
Harmarville Rehabilitation Center,
as well as the University of
Pittsburgh, are defendants in a suit
ﬁled by ﬁve delegates to the con-
ference from Washington’s Tri-
County Partnership for
Independent Living.

The five delegates, all wheel-
chair—bound, claim they were
unable to get accessible hotel
rooms. The Americans with
Disabilities Act, which took effect
on-Jan. 26, 1992, stipulates that a
public hotel such as the 207-room
Greentree Holiday Inn must have
at least seven rooms accessible to
the disabled. According to the suit,

only one room was accessible.

“Here are the people that should
be in the forefront of awareness,
yet those of us that have disabili- '
ties weren’t acknowledged,” plain-
tiff John Koval said. O

Koval said he couldn’t maneuver
his motorized scooter down the
narrow pathways of the lunch buf-
fet. “It was embarrassing as all
Hades to have to have people
move their chairs and tables to
allow me to eat,” he said.

Students, alumnae celebrate

By Christine Hanna
Asst. News Editor

Celebrating the changing role of
women in society, Pitt Chancellor J.
Dennis O’Connor joined 320 first-
year women in the Cathedral
Commons for Pitt’s traditional
Lantern Night ceremony. '

The candle changing to*a lantern
represents the changes that are
happening for women, O'Connor
said. These changes are “for the
better." Women are “free to choose
to excel,’-’ he said. ,

“By being here, you are demon-
strating your choice [as a woman]
to become an integral part of the
university,” President of the
Alumnae Council Cindi Roth said.

Roth said that even though the
ceremony has changed some

through the years, the meaning of ‘
A tradition is still the same. '

Center Ave.
eyed for new
university
housing site

By Matt Groff

Asst. News Editor

Pitt is “very close” to concluding a
deal which would provide university
housing in Shadyside for an additional
200 students, according to Dr. Ben
Tuchi, senior vice chancellor of busi-
ness and finance. ‘’

The acquisition of the apartment
complex, located at 5052 Centre
Avenue, is the most recent part of a
plan to improve Pitt housing and will
cost approximately $5.9 million.

“This summer $2.7 million was spent
on upgrading the dorms, improving
things such as the fire alarm systems,”
Tuchi said. “We plan on spending
about the same amount on improve-
‘ments next summer.”

Tuchi said this effort is in response
to increasing demand for on—campus
and university—sponsored housing.

“We are making a long-term commit-
ment to improve Pitt’s ability to recruit
and guarantee housing for longer peri-
ods of time,” Tuchi said.

The Shadyside complex would offer
luxury suite and apartment—type hous-
ing to Pitt undergraduate and ‘graduate
students, as well as faculty.

Living units will be priced compara-
bly to current Pitt dormitory costs.
James Watters, assistant vice chancel-
lor of real estate acquisition, said the
new apartment building, located by
Shadyside Hospital, is a 10-minute

, walk from Pitt campus.

The current Pitt transportation routes
will serve students at the new build-
ing, who will have the option of
reserved parking.

“Some of the apartments have three

Activities Terry Milani said that the
ceremony began when there was
both a dean of men and a dean of
women. This was one of the
women’s programs and it became a
collegiate tradition at Pitt‘, the said.

Several women said that tradition
was the reason they attended the
ceremony.

Panhellenic External - Vice
President Julie Holaren told the
participants that they are part of
Pitt’s 96th class which has included
both male and female students.

“I hope, as we show you the
meaning of Lantern Night, you will
realize we welcome you not just to
a place called the University of
Pittsburgh, but to a way of life that
will prepare you in your search for
knowledge,” Holaren said.

news.

Hyland told the women that the
first year at college can be exciting
and frightening at the same time.

She said that students must set
priorities straight and not get dis-
couraged. “You don’t have to be
the class valedictorian,” she said.
“Be the best and do the best you

can.

Women should not limit them— _

selves but find their hidden talents
and capitalize on them, according
to Hyland.

“You are our hope,” she said.
“You will open doors for the future
generation of women.”

In the rows of women,’ Hyland
said that there were future doctors,
economists and journalists. “You
do have what it takes,” she said.

‘-Pitt civilization’ explored at studentactivities fair

By Holly Callender
The Pitt News

First-year student Cathy
-Burkett said she attended the
student activities fair last night
because, “I didn’t just want to
sit in my room’ for the next four
years.”I

“This is the mecca of Pitt civi-
lization,” said First-year student

— Frank Humes, surveying the

over 100 student groups pack-
ing Forbes Quad last night.

4 Thousands of students filled
the ground ﬂoor and spilled out
onto the patio at the yearly
event sponsored by the Office
of Student Activities. The fair
housed representatives from
nearly every student organiza-
tion at the University of
Pittsburgh.

“We want to expose students
to "organizations here  to help
them make choices  and find
their niche,” said Jim Raymond,
assistant director of student
activities.

Students moved from table to

“I was active in high school,

student Creighton Moorehead
said. r

First year student Lisa Galka
said, “I want to get more
involved in the university. This
is really helpful. I didn’t know
there were this many groups.”

But not all students wanted to
join organizations. “I came here
looking for suitable mates,” said
first-year student Scott
Michener.

Benkert said, "1 had nothing

Members of Heinz Chapel
Choir carried signs declaring
“Singers wanted.” “We do this
to attract more attention to our-
selves,” said Jason Lewis.

John Ubucejo, another Heinz
Chapel Choir member said,
“About 90 percent of our
singers come from this activities
fair.”

Other student groups took a
more low-key approach to the
fair.

. “We’re here for recruitment,
to generate a mailing list,” said
Mike Fasolka of the Student
I-Ionors Activity Community.
Fasolka, a material science/lib-
eral studies major noted that
while SHAC generates a large
mailing list, only about 10 per-
cent of those who sign up stay
on as highly involved members.

“About 10 percent of Our
members. graduate every year,
so this evens things out,” said
Fasolka.

The fair canalso save the stu-
dent groups money. “This is the
best way for us to advertise,”
said ski club representative Tim

Eastley.

According to Eastley, the club
usually gets 500 to 700 names
and numbers without spending
money on advertisements.

Some university offices also

I participated in the fair.
Natalie Rosenbloom, a career‘

library staff member, represent-
ed the University Counseling
Services. According to
Rosenbloom, the counseling

_ center hopes to make students

aware of the services they have
to offer.

Jim Raymond said the fair,
held for the last four years, is
one of the highlights of orienta-
tion.

“The activities fair is becom-
ing too successful. There are
almost too many organizations
involved this year.”

According to Raymond, 148

groups reserved space for the
event. , ~

Raymond noted that even
with a 10 percent no-show,
many groups still had to be
moved to the patio area to
accommodate everyone.

Chancellor welcomes
new students oztpicmc

By Matt Serlin
Senior Photographer

, This year's class is going to be “spectacular,” Pitt
Chancellor J. Dennis O'Connor said, surveying the class of
1995' at ’-tlhepicnic he sponsored yesterday as a wrap up to
freshman orientation;
. “They look great. As a class, I think it is, if you look at the
numbers, the best class we’ve admitted. It’s certainly very,
very competitive. I think in part that's a reflection of the
increase numbereof applications that we got. It should be a
good class. It’s gonna be pretty spectacular,” O’Connor said.

Hundreds of students joined the chancellor, various admin-
istrators and mentors on the Cathedral lawn yesterday after-
noon to relax in the sun before starting classes.

“It’s nice to get food other than the cafeteria. I want classes 2

to start and get going with the studies,” first—year student Julie
Conlon said.

Other students said" they are also anxious to begin classes.

First—year student Mark‘ Frankel said he is looking forward
to them, but is going to take them, “One day,at a time.”

“I didn’t met as many people as I had hoped to meet,
because everybody was here all the time, but I hope to when
my classes start,” first—year student Heather Kay said.

Although O’Connor said the class looked spectacular, other

More than 1,500 first-year, students crowded
into the shaded half of the back Cathedral lawn
on Sunday to hear the first Freshman Convocation
at Pitt. Despite the intense afternoon heat,
Student Government Board President Jacob
Brody said the convocation would help form a
bond between students and the university.

“This ceremony is important because the uni-
versity is saying to the students, ‘We will venture
together in all endeavors, be they academic, per-

sonal or athletic,” Brody said.

Several students agreed that the service was
valuable, but also said the heat was distracting
and probably decreased attendance.

“It was hard to pay attention because it was so
hot,” first—year student Brittan Forsythe said. “But
the speakers seemed very supportive of our class
and interested in helping our careers.”

The convocation was the initial event of
Orientation ‘93 and featured Pitt Chancellor J.

bers of the university community dressed in cap

Lacie of wardrobe resulted in education C6l7”8€7”fO7” Cavalla

By Laura Zotis

For T be Pitt News

The unwieldy, larger-than-life-size
Omicron Delta Kappa key in Joe
Cavalla’s office is only one of his many
remembrances of his work as director of
student activities at Pitt and at other uni-
versities. Cavalla is also the adviser for
ODK, a leadership honor society, and he
"has has a long history of service to other
student organizations as well.

“I really enjoy the university atmos-
phere,” Cavalla said. “I feel that I can
relate to the students. It is fun to follow a
freshman through their four years here.”

ButcCavalla said it was never a
planned-out career of his to be a director
of student activities.

After graduate school,- Cavalla taught
high school for two years at which point
hereceived a letter from the Dean of
Students at his alma mater, Rider
College, saying a position was opening
in Student Activities.

“I went down ‘for the interview and it
was like going back home again,”
Cavalla said, “teaching, letter from Rider,
one thing led to another and boom I
took the job.” ,

Ironically, at the same time Cavalla
interviewed with Rider he receiveda job

offer from IBM as well.

“I chose higher education versus busi-
ness and industry  I didn’t have
enough suits to work for IBM, I would
have needed a whole new wardrobe,”
Cavalla says with a laugh.

Cavalla says he is glad he make the
decision he did.

“I enjoy most the people contact  the
interaction with people makes it interest-
ing. It’s a whole new crew every four
years, you get a new crew of people,
new outlooks, new ideas and that’s
always interesting,” Cavalla said.

A beleiver in being upfront and
straighforward, Cavalla said “what you
see is what you get with me._ I’m an hon-
est person and I tell it like it is  I’m
kind of blaze in some respects.”

A native of New jersey, Cavalla is an
alumnus of Rider College. in
Lawrenceville, N.Y,., where he also
worked as the director of student activi-
ties. After 19 years at Rider, he decided
to move to a larger school with a larger

“I love Pittsburgh!” Cavalla said. “The
people here are friendly, and they make
you feel at home. This is a good city to
raise a family in, and as a sports nut, I
love it here.

Cavalla takes a break in his office.
“This university has a lot to offer, as
does the city of Pittsburgh itself,” Cavalla
said. ”There are a lot of services and pro-
grams here.”

Historic landmark preserves music, instruments of Foster

By Mike Lyczko
Staff Writer

Music from Pitt has been heard in 31
states by an estimated 15 million people.

Dear Friends is a traveling ensemble
playing 19th-century American music
based on the Stephen Foster Memorial’s
collection. Performing in costume, its
music ranges from Civil War to Victorian-
era parlor to “immigrant” (including
Irish) music.

The group has produced a series of
cassettes, and its performances have
been packaged into six one-hour radio
programs produced with help from
WQED 89.5 FM, said Deane Root, cura-
tor of the Stephen Foster Memorial.
National Public Radio syndicated these

programs as “American Holidays with
the Dear Friends.” .

Dear Friends, formed in 1985, gets its
name from the words on a scrap of
paper (displayed in the
Memorial’s exhibit room) found in
Foster’s pocket when he died.

The Stephen'Foster Memorial, located
on the Forbes Avenue side of the
Cathedral of Learning, has a variety of
sections with many uses. The building,
constructed in honor of the 19th-century
composer from Pittsburgh, has been
judged a historic landmark by the
Pittsburgh History and Landmarks
Foundation. Foster’s songs include “Oh

Old Kentucky Home.”

Root said the unique part of the build-

Foster A

ing is the exhibit area housing the
Stephen Foster collection. The circular
exhibit room has 12 cubicles framed by
six stone archways. Within the cubicles
hang facsimiles of sheet music for
Foster’s songs. (The originals are locked
in a safe). Further along the wall, stained
glass windows depict his lyrics.

Foster’s piano, presented to the
Carnegie Museum in 1899 by a Foster
relative, is now on loan to the exhibit
area, along with a guitar made by
Foster’s publisher in the 1850s and a
19th-century accordion or squeezebox.

There are also copies of Foster man_u- '

scripts, and a cured horse’s jawbone
used as a rninstrel percussion instrument.
Two states, Florida and Kentucky, have
adopted Foster songs as their official

songs.

Among the other Foster memorabilia is
the Stephen Foster bowl, three of which
Were made in 1949 as a representation of
Americana. The original was presented
by President Harry Truman to Queen
Wilhelmina of the Netherlands.

“A federally funded appraisal in 1985
found that [the Foster collection] was
one of the three or four most important
or most significant collections of 19th-
century American music,” Root said.
“Since the exhibit area is small, we’ve
had to be real creative. One example is
our collaboration with the Western
Pennsylvania Historical Society. We
wanted an exhibit that asked, ‘What can

Cavalla is halfway through a
doctoral degree in higher edu-
cation at Pitt. “I’m really psy-
ched about finishing that pro-
gram. 1 always wanted to learn
to play the piano and get my

sight. I did it for my own per-
sonal satisfaction —— maybe it

Students at the service were
reminded of Pitt’s tradition in
academics and encouraged to
leave their own mark at Pitt.

O’Connor’s speech pointed
out historical accomplishments
of Pitt pioneers suchas the dis-
covery of a polio vaccine and
research on the composition of
the rings of Saturn. He encour-

“You are here to get an edu-

ular activities, though. That is
important. It teaches you to deal

If students do well in the
classroom,‘ they can use their
knowledge in extracurricular
activities,
according to Cavalla.

“Freshmen must make their
own choices, but there is a
plethora of things to do on cam-
pus,” Cavalla said.

“The first semester is going to
be rough, especially living on
campus. Go slow.... Find your
niche. There is a student activi-
ties fair at the beginning of the

Association President Steve
Parks said.

“But we’ll see how many grad
students actually get to live
there,” he said.

Parks said that in light of how
much undergraduate housing
exists in Oakland, more atten-
tion should be paid to the
10,000 grads to which universi-
ty housing is not offered.

Despite the 11 residence halls
on-campus, many students
agree that Pitt needs more
housing for undergrads, also.

Chris Kelly, an undergraduate
student who lived in Sutherland
Hall last year, said he is frustrat-
ed by the current lottery system
at Pitt.

“Students are penalized for
being upperclassmen,” Kelly
said. ’

“Because of my lottery num-
ber, I couldn’t even retain my
room from last term. Now I
have to stay on a waiting list to
live where I did last year.”

“Students will not be placed

ment of housing,” Watters said.
"But the department of proper-
ty management will be working
closely with housing to take
care of those displaced in the
lottery.” ,

As the deal stands, Pitt plans
to assume the building’s mort-
gage and use bond proceeds to

- cover the cost of the building.

The legal details of the sale are
still being worked out, includ-
ing arrangements with current
tenants.

Tuchi said he expects to see
students placed in the building
fairly soon.

“Pitt may be placing residents
in the building within two
months of the settlement of this
purchase,” Tuchi said.

“It all depends on how quick-

.ly we are able to work through

Alma mater Betty Levan
Metz, a member of the
Alumnae Council,
explained what exactly
the light of the lantern
symbolizes.

“You are standing
before the burning shrine
of truth, lit to symbolize
the light -which enables

‘‘It is our wish that you
will use the light, symbol-
ically, to illuminate your
path as you set out to find
your place in the
University of Pittsburgh.”

She told the women to
take advantage of all
types of experiences,
because within those
experiences lies the key
to each woman as a per-
son, a student, a friend
and a member of the
community.

Twenty flame bearers,

Metz said. that the uni-

fun, fresh opportunities
and a sense of wonder
and awe.

‘‘If this is the light you
seek, give us a pledge of
your faith and hope,” she
told them.

After this, there was a
moment of silence for for-
mer women’s dean,
Helen Pool Rush, who
founded Lantern Night.

“Go now with your
lighted lantern, symbolic
of your search for truth
and knowledge,” Roth
said.

stopped by for the free watermelon and to catch a
glimpse of the fraternities. “I really don’t want to

said.

According to Bralich, this year’s picnic was dif-
ferent. Fraternity and s_orority members (Ro Chis),

who are disafﬁliated from their organization dur-*‘'
ing rush, introduced the potential rushees to the

other members.
First-year student Kristen Pfirrmann, who
attended the picnic, said, “I came here to look at

Other students had different perspectives about
joining the Greek system.

Andrea Mikush, a transfer student who is inter-
ested in joining a sorority, said she thought in
addition to meeting people, being in a sorority or
fraternity could make connections for later in life
when you are looking for a job.

Bralich said that potential rushees need not
worry that if they sign up for rush they are bound
to the Commitment.

through the history of its
music?”

The “Pittsburgh Rhythms”
exhibit has been at the
Historical Society from June
1991 and will continue through
1994, Root said.

“lt’s a musical profile of the
city’s history or the history of a
city through its music. People
have come from ‘ the
Smithsonian, New York, all over
— to see it and get ideas.”

Root is a Pitt music professor
and teaches courses using the
Stephen Foster collection.
Faculty and students from the
history, music, art, library sci-
ence and English literature

0 departments also use the collec—~

tion.

“We also have opportunities
for volunteer work as museum
docents or internships,” he said.
A library science student’s
internship on preservation by
climate control was the back-

0 ground work that was later edit-
‘ed into grant proposals that
, brought funding for air, temper-

ature and humidity controls,
Root said. ,.
The auditorium, which makes

, H up the bulk of the building, has ,
\_several uses. . '

“Outside groups as well as
"university groups use the audi-

« torium, ” Root said.

“There is a real variety — pro-
fessional and student. The audi-
torium has a great tradition
which goes back to Gene_Kelly,

who as a student performed on‘

the stage.”

It is the mainstage for both
Pitt’s theater arts department
and the black studies depart-
ment’s Kuntu Repertory
Theater. The Three Rivers
Shakespeare Festival, a profes-
sional theater company in resi-
dence at Pitt, is also based at the
Foster Memorial.

Air Force ROTC ceremonies

have been held there, and other

professional theater companies
rent the building occasionally,
usually around December.
During the otherwise slow peri-
od of August, it is used by the
city of Pittsburgh and summer
youth programs, Root said.
Below the auditorium is a
“good multi—purpose room for
receptions, book sales, blood
drives, rehearsals and classes.
lt’s in constant use,” he said.
Although the library is not
technically -part of the Hillman

system, it is listed as a university‘

library, Root said. There are
50,000 pieces in the library.
Books on Stephen Foster
include a four—volume set writ-
ten by Deane Rootand his stu-
dent Steven Saunders. The col-
lection includes many books
about early American music, as
well as a hand—operated “Regina
Music Box.” 0
Although some have suggest-
ed that all the university’s spe-
cial collections be consolidated
at Hillman, Root said that it
makes sense to keep all the

‘Stephen Foster material in the

same place.

Newman
Oratory  
Center

The library-format materials
are cataloged on PITTCAT,
while the museum-format mate-
rials, such as objects, are docu-
mented on paper, Root said.
Anything on PITTCAT is also on
OCLC, which is the international
on-line catalog. People from all
over the world can access this,
he said.

“We collaborate with Hillman
on cataloging, shared informa-
tion, preservation, and we also
collaborate on getting grants,”
Root said. 0

The library is open 9 a.m. to 4
p.m. Monday through Friday.
Exhibit hours are the same,
including Saturday 11 a.m. to 4
p.m. and Sunday 1 p.m.-to /l
p.m. ‘

Root said weekend hours are
dependent on staffing from vol-
unteers, which include staff or
students. .

“One of the things I wanted to
do was make the Foster
Memorial accessible to the pub-

‘lic,” Root said. ‘‘I answer 1,000

requests a year from around the
world about the collection.”
Root said the only staff is a sec-
retary.

Funding for the Three Rivers
Shakespeare Festival comes
from outside but is managed
through university accounting,
according to Root.

The “Pittsburgh Rhythms”
exhibit cost $150,000, with
some funding coming from the
state, and other money coming
from private donationsand
local foundations, Root said.

Stand hehzna’ your words

Last night 320 first-year female students gathered
together for Pitt’s 75rd.annual Lantern Night ceremony.

Founded so that female alumni could show their sup-
port for the young women entering the university dur-
ing a time when female enrollment was low, the cere-
mony represents the strength of women at Pitt.

Women were not allowed to attend Pitt until 110
years after men did. Since then there have been many
changes for women and for the ceremony, but Lantern
Night still symbolizes the passing of the knowledge of
light from one generation to another. I

Pitt Chancellor J. Dennis O’Connor spoke at last
night's ceremony. .

“There will be many changes for women in the future,
changes for the better. They will be free to choose to
excel,” he said. .

If the university stands behind these changes, then an
important step should be creating a women’s study
major. .

Approximately 105 colleges in the United States have '

a women’s studies major, including Penn State,
University of Pennsylvania, Columbia University and
Harvard. Pitt does offer a women’s study certificate
which 70 students are currently working towards, but a
certificate is not enough. A major needs-to be offered
so that students can concentrate on what they're inter-
ested in, rather than have it be supplementary to anoth-
er major. — '

I Critics of the women’s studies program judge its valid-
ity and importance as a major all by itself. However,

S women’s studies classes teach a variety of subjects such

as psychology, sociology, literature and pop culture,
but they are taught from a women’s perspective which
is often left out of traditional reading material.

Studying more than one point of view which is often
male-oriented can be valuable for both men and
women. . ‘

Many employment opportunities are available with a
degree in women’s studies. Careers in medicine, poli-
tics and social work can concentrate specifically on
women’s issues. Also, a more specific program of study
can further a persons’ success in their graduate work.

With job markets and graduate programs becoming
more and more competitive, it’s ridiculous to deny a
student this major when a department already exists. It
seems that the existing program would be very easy to
expand upon. '

Designing this degreewould also beneﬁt the universi-
ty. With the growing interest in this subject and its rela-
tive inaccessibility, Pitt could attract more students.

Since 1921 the Lantern ceremony has encouraged

women to succeed at this university. At last night’s cere—_ .

mony, O’Connor promoted change. At a university
which offers a..wide variety of courses and is known for
its diversity, O’Connor should stand behind his words
a.nd support the creation a women’s study major.

Study bigotry not homosexuality

“Study Links Homosexuality to Fondness for

‘H Members of the Same Sex.” — It seems that every
time I pick up a magazine or newspaper, I am

confronted with similar headlines about a new
study claiming to find the cause of homosexuali-
ty. Some of them are almost as ridiculous as the
one I made up. Recently, we had the infamous
hypothalamus study. Then, we had anothertwins
study. There have also been studies on fetal hor-
monal levels and homosexuality. Most recently,
l’ve read about the newest scientific gaze into the
complex world of human sexuality — the X-chro-
mosome study. In this study, scientists claim to
have found new evidence show-

would not change if I could.

This may come as quite a shock to many peo-
ple who believe thatqueer people all hate them-
selves for being queer. This is not true. I am per-
fectly happy being queer. What I am not happy
with is the negative and often hateful attitudes of
many people in society towards myself and other
queer people.

The focus of scientific research should be on
those unenlightened people rather than on the
many lesbian, gay and bisexual people who sim-
ply want to live their lives.

It would be more useful to do a study of bigot-

ed people and what causes their

ing that homosexuality originates
from a gene located somewhere
on the X—chromosome.
Researchers believe that homo-
sexuality is inherited most often
from the mother.

It has always been a specula-

bigotry rather than on homosex-
uality. Maybe scientists _can find
a bigotry gene, or an intolerance
gene, much like the one for
homosexuality. I can see the
headlines now: “Scientists dis-
cover link between stupidity and

tion that domineering mothers

make their little boys queer: a.k.a. “Mama’s boys.”
But, to take this myth and research it scientiﬁcally
is preposterous. Instead of lookﬁig for the cause]
of homosexuality, maybe researchers should look
into what causes domineering mothers.

As a gay person, I really couldn’t care less
about these studies. If I feel anything, it is annoy-
ance because so many research dollars are spent
on this tiresome subject. Whatever caused me to
be who I am does not really matter to me. Even
many gay, lesbian and bisexual activists build our
civil rights movement around the premise that
homosexuality, like race and gender, is an
immutable characteristic, and therefore, not
grounds for discrimination. In plain English, “We
can’t help who we are, so would you please give
us our rights?” I

With the lack of funding for research on cures
for AIDS and cancer, as well as so many other
diseases, spending any money, public or private,
on trying to find the cause of homosexuality is
ridiculous. It disgusts me to watch people fight
thesevdiseases while scientists write about their
discoveries of the “causes? of homosexuality.

What worries me even more is the insistence by
many at the forefront of the lesbian and gay rights
movement to base our demands for equality on
such research. We don’t know if our sexuality is
caused genetically or socially, but many still
demand civil rights on the premise that we can’t
help it. This kind of thinking implies that if we
had a choice, we wouldn’t deserve our rights and
shouldn’t be asking for (or demanding) them.

Even more disturbing, it also implies that if we
had a choice we wouldn’t, or shouldn’t, choose
to be gay. It makes heterosexuality out to be the
better alternative, and therefore, clearly superior.
If I had a choice, I would choose to be queer. I

bigotry.” Brilliant. Maybe the
hypothalami of bigoted people are smaller than
those of more tolerant people. I suspect that their
entire brains are smaller.

And just where would scientists get their
human guinea pigs for such experiments? I can
picture our brave, inquisitive scientist now,
approaching people at a Klan rally, asking them if
they will participate in a study of the intelligence
levels of bigots. Maybe the scientist would even
be able to find out if the bigot had bigoted sib-
lings. Possibly one of the bigots had a domineer-
ing bigot parent. Or, maybe there was a severely-
traumatic ChllC1ltJOd experience with a liberal in
the family that made them, choose bigotry. The
scientist might even ﬁnd out if this bigotry is just
a “phase” that the bigot is passing through in
order to rebel against their overly—liberal parents.
If this all sounds ridiculous to you, then you have

some understanding of how all of these homo-_

sexuality studies sound to me. ‘ ,
America should get over its obsession with
what makes gay people gay and start worrying
about more important issues. What people need
to realize is that human sexuality is very complex.
There is no one simple “cause” for any type of
sexual behavior or orientation. We are all prod-
ucts of a complex interaction between genetics
and environment. Looking for the gene that caus-

es homosexuality is just as pointless as looking '

for the gene that causes a person to be attracted
to large-breasted women, or the gene for liking
Swedish meatballs. (Now there’s one that worries
me.) Headline: “Researchers Discover Gene for
Swedish Meatball Orientation.” “A cure is just
around the corner,” says optimistic scientist.

There’s hope for America yet.

That effect is more apparent
in games with the Panthers, a
team with a new coaching
staff and an unsettled lineup.

On Monday, . Majors
answered‘ the question that

’ has been asked most often
when he named redshirt
sophomore John Ryan as his
starting quarterback for
tomorrow night’s game in

“Ryan has made more
progress the last week or so,”
Majors said. “He’s picked up
things a little better mentally

Think_.back to the end of last year’s football
,. season. While other programs were winding
up their recruiting season, the University of
Pittsburgh was just looking to hire a coach
with enough determination and charisma to
rebuild a tradition-rich Panther program that
in recent years had been on the decline.

To accomplish this feat, Johnny Majors was
named head coach of the same program that
he had propelled to national prominence
some 20 years ago.

His first ‘problem was the obvious need for

  

Underrated rookie class targets respect  

team speed, but despite having a reputation
as a storied coach, Majors and-his newly-
assembled coaching staff only had three and a
I half weeks to recruit athletes that were being
sought after for-"a year by 5other"schools with

national recognition.

Despite Majors efforts, he felt the ‘93
recruiting class didn’t accurately reflect his

ability to recruit prospects to Pitt.

“This wasn’t a fair test, this was a makeshift,
catch—up deal,” Majors said. “[It was] a salvage
job with only three and a half weeks. We had

the least amount of time to recruit.”

Campus excited but cautious about Majors‘ return

It’s been a given, since the day former

University of Tennessee head coach

Johnny Majors was brought back to Pitt,

V that there would be a new attitude
around campus about Panther football.

It’s Johnny, right? National
Championship, right? “Back to the

‘ Future,” right?

Right. A

“Everyone I’ve talked to is a lot more
excited about [this year’s football pro-
gram than last year],” undergraduate
Keith Kolody said. “He’s a ‘new’ coach
who has already been here before, and
he’s coming back. It should be interest-
ing.” , J

ing. I

This is pretty damn exciting.

tration but I think the attitude on cam-

pus is one of expectations, one of

O’Connor said. “I think obviously the
team is working well. On the part of the
players, Ithink they're going to do
well.” ' I
“lMajors has] deﬁnitely brought a lot

of excitement to the campus and rev-
enue to the university, and I think that it
will create a lot of spirit toward Pitt
again,” senior Steve Walker said.

‘ “Whether or not they prove it this year

with a winning season [remains to be
seen], but the Pitt spirit has definitely
been woken up.”

Yes, the Pitt "spirit has been woken
up, but the big question is whether or
not a team that went 3-8 last year can
be woken up. Even the most enthusias-
tic enter the season with cautious opti-
mism.

“I think that it’s good to have a fresh
face, but they’re making ’

game they play.”

There are those who, God forbid,
care nothing for what’s going to happen
at the top of Cardiac Hill this season.

‘ They, unlike those of us who have
grown up with pennant races, football
and Midnight Madness in the fall, will
dutifully carry on with academic pur-
suits that have been pushed to the back
burners by the rest of us — at least on
Saturday afternoons anyhow. ‘

“I don’t think they’ll do that much
better than last year because you just
can’t change a team in one season,"
Smith said. “But I "think we’ll win some

mics and I don’t like football,” an
unnamed co—ed repeated.

Yeah, but 

“I haven’t thought aboutfootball that
much,” said ﬁrst—year student Patrick
Smith. ‘‘I don’t know that’ much at all.”

Nevertheless, the old downhome
Majors excitement has clearly galva-
nized the college football community -
both within the city and without.

Having been featured in newspapers
from Memphis’ Commercial Appeal to
USA Today, the College Football Hall-of-

Famer has inspired Pitt loyalty from
even the most die—hard Tennessee
Volunteers fans.

It’s believed around the country that
Majors has little talent to work with.
Those closer to the team know that is
not true, but the fact remains that the
same people who prop Majors are not
giving this team a chance to win. .

Add a vicious home schedule to the
perceived lack of talent and you have
the makings of an incredibly-futile sea-

, son.

But while such a season was intolera-

ble with a Foge Fazio or a Paul Hackett,

it’s totally different with a man who
doesn’t disguise the fact that the pro-
gram needs money, talent and leader-
ship.

Majors’ blunt realism and the fact that
he’s been around the coaching block
and was successful at every stop gives
people a little more assurance that
things are going to be alright.

Hey, who else can get away with
promising a, lawn full of undergraduates
that he wants to get to know each and
every one of them by the timethey
leave school?

Only Johnny.

The Pitt News Interview: Pitt
soccer coach Joe Luxbacher

By Jack Becker
Sla_[f Writer

When looking through the

record books of the Pitt soccer ,

team, some impressive ﬁgures

tend to follow Joe Luxbacher’s _

name like a career total 35
goals, a mind boggling seven
goals in a single game.

The Panthers’ head coach has
enjoyed success as a player, a
coach and as the author of
eight books. I

Luxbacher tells The Pitt News
of his experiences along the
long road of his career.

» Pitt News: Was last season’s
team the best team you’ve ever
coached?

Joe Luxbacher: Well it was
certainly one of the better
teams. We had much more
depth last year, we were much
deeper than in other years.
There might have been teams
in the past with more talent,
but we had the right mix of
players last year. They would
have to rank right-up there
with some of the best.

PN: What was the biggest
win you’ve been involved in as
a coach?

JL: When we beat Seton Hall
here last year -and a big win
against Connecticut as well.

PN: What was thebiggest
win you’ve been involved in as
a player?

JL: The most exciting game
was when I played against the
Italian National Army team in

_my rookie year with the

Philadelphia Atoms; We tied
them 2-2 and I scored both
goals. Every other team in the
league [North American Soccer
League] lost, but we tied them.
I was just at the right place at
the right time and to score both
goals  it was definitely a
highlight. ‘

I also scored the first goal
ever for the [Pittsburgh] Spirit.

Those had to be the two most _

exciting moments. i

PN: What was your most
rewarding moment as a coach?

JL: -When we won that 12th
game last year, which is a Pitt
record — that was the most
rewarding. We had an out-
standing group of seniors with
[Scott] Alexander, [].R.] Perdue
and all of them. After getting
thumped in their first year, and
by the time they graduated, ~
they took with them the record
for most wins in a season at
Pitt. They were an outstanding
group of men  They'll have
those memories forever.

PN: When a player leaves
your program, what do you
want him to take with him? ’

JL: For one, good memories
 like the 12 wins-last year.
These are the best times of
their lives. I want them to do as
well as their capable, work
hard and be happy with what-
ever the results.Most people
won’t make a total commitment
to whatever it is, academics,
soccer whatever. If you do
make that commitment, then I
think you’ll experience success.

PN: You’ve written a number

of books dealing with the

teaching and techniques of soc-
cer. Can you sum up the ideas
in those books and say what
you feel is the most important
aspect or technique that a soc-
cer player should know? 0

JL: I’d say that young players
need to learn the basics first.
They need to learn the basic
skills of soccer. As the player
gets older, then they can learn
to play the tactical side of the
game.But good players accept
responsibility. Good players
don’t look to a coach or some-
one else. Good players don’t
do that  they take charge.

PN: When did you begin play-
ing soccer?

JL: I didn’t play organized
until I was 14. My dad was my
first coach. I learned the most
from him. I didn’t have a coach
until college really. A

PN: Who is the best player
you ever coached?

JL: In my first year of coach-
ing, there was a guy named
Uzona Shibundu. He was

Nigerian and he was a walk—on.
He was very talented, a man
among boys. He was a leader,
the captain of the team.

PN: Did you always want to
coach?

JL: Not at all.
planned on it. I had a degree in
biological science and I

planned on going to grad .

school.I couldn’t say I love
coaching. It’s more like being a
manager. Not all of the job is
enjoyable. . .

PN: What directionis the
program headed in right now?

JL: 1 think the right direction.
The last three or four years we
have been right there. It’s a
strong, solid program. We don’t
have the quote ‘blue—chip play-
er.’ The guys you can just send
out on the field and say ‘win
the game.’ But we develop
solid players here.

In the past, when we
improved it didn’t show in the
results  Last year the results
mirrored our improvement.

Lineup all but set for '93 edition of Pitt volleyball

By Ryan Buncher

Senior Staff Writer

Ever since the second—ranked
Stanford Cardinals snuffed out
the 1992 Pitt volleyball season
in the NCAA tournament, the
focus has been on a ‘95
Panthers squad that would not
lose a single player to gradua-
tion. The lineup seemed to be
set on a team expected to win
the Big East and beyond.

“Last year was really scary,
having five freshmen come in.

_This year everyone’s back. Our

goal this year is to win the Big
East, but we’re’looking past
that,” senior All-American can-
didate Ann Marie Lucanie said.
“We think it’s a pretty secure
thing. Everyone’s pretty much
used to [setter] Annie
lMernaghl, so we can try to get
a few more plays going and
make our attacks stronger.”
Preseason has brought a few
changes. Pitt’s lone newcomer,

Laurie Fernandez, has stepped

over Pitt’s imperfect bill of
health.

“In a perfect world, every-
body’s 100 percent and you are
fully loaded,” Begor said. “I
talked to [Terry] Petit, the

Nebraska coach. I couldn’t get

in a word edgewise because all
he told me was about how beat
up and injured and sore they
were. That made me feel a little
better.” .

The positive story in the
medical department is sopho-
more defensive specialist Laura
Horvath. The five-foot—three-
inch sophomore had been a
question mark due to shoulder
problems. '

“She is 100 percent back and

‘playing really well,” Braziel

said.

One thing that did not hap-
pen in preseason was the
selection of a set starting six.
Braziel said that every player
will start at some point this

.weekend, including defensive

specialists as first—teamers.

; That group will get an early
opportunity to prove itself as
the Panthers continue their
recent practice of playing tough
opponents in their openers.

Last year, Pitt travelled to
Nebraska to face the
Cornhuskers as well as top-20
teams New Mexico and Pacific.
It lost all three matches.

“As freshmen, we were pretty
scared,” Mikla» said. “We were
playing in front of thousands
[of fans]. We were ‘pretty
embarrassed.”

Begor, who was an assistant
at Nebraska the last two years,
said he expects the
Cornhuskers to be as good as
ever despite losing some quali-
ty players.

“I think it gives us the oppor-
tunity to play some of the bet-
ter teams in the country, so
when we go to the NCAA tour-
nament, we’ll have already
played teams of that caliber,”
Begor said. "Early in the sea-
son, if you beat up on Saint
Mary’s School for the Blind,
you don’t learn anything about
yourself. You can’t make
adjustments, and you can’t
improve if you don’t learn any-
thing about yourself. If we
have a weakness, it’s going to
get exposed this weekend.”

One player who will be in
her element among top players
is Lucanie.

“I told [Lucanie] the other
day... ‘Am, I’ve recruited All-
Americans and national team
players  and you would be a
great player at Nebraska. You
would be a definite top—five
player, definite All—American,’
Begor said.

“I think that’s one of the best
things Pitt has going for them
this year. We are a very good
team, but what will separate us
from a lot of opponents is we
have a great -player. At 15-13 in
game five, you need a ball to
go down, we’ve got a player
who we know  she will get a
kill.”

SPIKES AND VOLLEYS:

Lisa Nallepa, who had trans-
ferred to Pitt from Penn State

ESPN oﬂers exposure, megozbucksfor Pittfootbozllzi

Stephen Flinn
Staff Writer

The Pitt football team has
been anxious to put to good
use what it has learned so far
from new head coach Johnny
Majors and his staff. But up
until last week, the team had
no idea it would be given the
chance to showcase its indoc-
trination into “Back To The
Future” in front of the entire
country. A

The Entertainment and Sports
Programming Network stork
dropped the big surprise on
Pitt’s doorstep last Tuesday as
the mega—sports network was
forced to find a replacement for
its Auburn/Mississippi State
game due to Auburn being
banned from television appear-
ances this year by the NCAA.

Thus, the Panthers and the
Southern Mississippi Golden
Eagles were politely asked by
ESPN if they would consider
moving their Saturday, Sept. 4,
opening game to Thursday
evening, Sept. 2, in order to be
televised nationwide on said
network. .

"We looked at what was
available to us and we were
very happy to‘ get Pitt and
Southern Mississippi,” ESPN
public relations representative

josh Krulewitz said.
“Obviously, we wanted the
game we had originally sched-
uled, but after that fell through,
we planned on this
[Pitt/Southern Mississippi]
game, and we’re happy to get
it.”

Pitt and Southern Miss gladly
obliged ESPN and agreed to
move the game to Thursday
night, leaving everybody in
Hattiesburg, Miss., ecstatic
and almost everybody in
Pittsburgh, Pa, ecstatic.

“We are very happy about
the chance to play on ESPN,”
Southern Miss PR staff member
John Cox said. “Anytime you
can get on television and
expose your program to a
national audience, it’s a big
plus. _

“The reaction by our players
has been pretty positive. And

allof‘ our fans are 100 percent

for it, too.

Pitt also seem just as ecstatic
about the chance to open the
1995 season on television
and collect approximately
$400,000.

“We were given a good
chance to open on ESPN.
Everybody’s excited about it.

Tom Tumulty said. “It’s a good
chance for us to show every-
body what we’ve learned and
the discipline we’ve developed
to play 60 minutes.”

Tumulty wasn’t the. only’

‘player to convey those senti-
ments.

But everybody in Pittsburgh
doesn’t share those same
thoughts on the matter, as Walt
Bielich, interim head of the
Golden Panthers’ Alumni
Booster Club explains.

“There are some mixed emo-
tions. Some fans are upset
because they planned the trip
to Hattiesburg several months
in advance and now they have
to change their plans. Then
there are those people who
couldn’t change their plans.

“Some. people bought non-
refundable tickets from the air-
lines. Those people are really
stuck. So some fans were ‘dis-
appointed, and we did get
some calls about it, but for the
most part, people have been
understanding of the situation.

“There are very few people
who turn down television
appearance," Majors said. "We
need the money in the worst
way. This decision had to be
‘made. ‘

“There are three «things that
can happen to us by this game

being on television, all good
for recruiting. '

First of all, we could win the
game. Second, we could lose
but play well, which would
look good to the television
audience. Thirdly, we could
lose bad, in that case, we’ll

 

show the youth of America that
we need help. I don’t think
we’re capable of playing badly
‘and winning. V
“My only concern about the
decision [to move the game]
was the inconvenience of our
fans,” Majors said.

ETA SIGMNS

By Stephen Flinn
staff Writer

Matt Cavanaugh admits it was
coincidence that he is now part
of Pitt’s coaching staff.

“After my playing days were
over, I moved to Pittsburgh last
August. ‘At that time, Paul
Hackett was Pitt’s coach and he
was also my quarterback coach
at San”Francisco when I was
with the 49ers, so I just hoped
something would turn up.
“When Coach Majors became
Pitt’s head coach, it was just by

‘dumb luck that I was in the

right place at the right time.”

It may have been by dumb
luck that Cavanaugh joined the
Panther staff, but luck had
nothing to do with the creden-
tials he earned while playing 14
years in the NFL, as well as
helping to lead the ‘Panthers to
a National Championship in
1976  as we’ll see when we
travel down that gridiron road
and take a look at Matt
Cavanaugh because, “Matt, this
is your football life.”

Matt played high school foot-
ball at Chaney High in his

hometown of Youngstown,
Ohio. Some of his strongest
attributes were already appar-
ent as remembered by his high
school coach, Ed Matey.

“He was just a great, young
kid. He started for us from his
sophomore year on. He had
unbelievable talent and ability.
Physically he was big and
strong, and he really under-
stood the game of football,”
Matey said.’

Just as important as his skills
at this time was Matt’s knowl-
edge and leadership capabili-
ties.

“When Matt walked in the
huddle, all the other players
looked up to him. They knew
what they had to do, and they
just went out and got the job
done,” Matey said. _

From high school,
Cavanaugh went on to play at
the University of Pittsburgh
under head coach Johnny
Majors. While at Pitt,
Cavanaugh passed for 3,578
yards, ranking him sixth on
Pitt’s all-time passing'ro§ter. He
helped lead Pitt to a national
championship in 1976, beating

1 H A" message from Pitts Department of Public Safety

Georgia University and winning
MVP in the Sugar Bowl.

“lMattl was an outstanding
player in Pitt football history.
He came from a great back-
ground and was a very serious,
very intelligent, very positive
individual,” Majors said.

While at Pitt, Cavanaugh was
a true leader, not a cocky kid
that can sometimes be typical
of a successful athlete, as Kim
Hall, Tower C cafeteria manag-
er at that time remembers.

“When l.was in charge of
training table, I remember Matt
very well. He always had time
to stop and chat about the
game with us. He was very
well—mannered and soft-spo-
ken. He was not a hot-shot.
But what I noticed the most
about him was that other play-
ers literally followed him
around. They looked up to him
as their leader,” Hall said.

In 1977, Matt’s final year at
Pitt, Majors left for his alma
mater at Tennessee and the
Panther helm was’ handed over
to one time Pitt assistant coach
Jackie Sherrill.

Cavanaugh broke his wrist

against Notre Dame that season 9

and missed the next three
games, but still managed to
come back and lead Pitt to a 9-
2-1 season as his head coach at
the time, Jackie Sherrill, recalls.

“With Matt we had a great
team, without him, we had a
very average team  I shudder
to think what it might have

been if [Cavanaugh] would

have been healthy the entire
season,” Sherrill said.
After graduating from Pitt in

1978, Cavanaugh wasldrafted ,

by the New England Patriots in
the second-round of the NFL
draft. Cavanaugh played with
the Patriots from 1978,to 1982.

He constantly battled Steve
Grogan for the starting QB
position at New England, but
when called upon to; be the
backup, was magnificent in his
role. So much so that current
Patriots’ Coach Bill Parcells
compared his potential backup
QB to Cavanaugh.

“I like Tommy Hodson
because he sees the field yery
well andmovesthe team just
like Matt Cavanaugh was able
to do so well,” Parcells said.

Some Patriots’ fans had noth-
ing but good things to say
about Cavanaugh. _

David Gomes, native, of

Lexington, Mass., recollects .

Cavanaugh’s days with the
Patriots. ’ .

,,“I am a die—hard Patriots fan,
and _I remember Cavanaugh

well. He may not have the arm.

strength of Grogan or Plunkett,
but he was a really good back-
up quarterback. ‘He was ‘defi-

"nitely there when we needed

him,” Gomes saidl ,

 . ' Also recollecting Ca_vana_ugh’s
_ fPatriot days is Ed Doyle man-_
 -- agerand bartenderat Cheers .
’ (Bull and Finch; Pub) in Boston- '

, “Cavanaugh was a good QB.

VI/e were disappointed’ when
‘he left. We haven’t been too-

successful since then. We have

‘so many unproven QBS now,
maybe we need him again here _
{instead of his being at Pittl,” ~

‘expressed his desire to obtain a

quarterback mature enough to
step up to the challenge of run-
ning his program.

His first choice was the most

sought-after offensive player in-

the nation —-Berwick quarter-
back Ron Powlus.

After Powlus committed to
the University of Notre Dame,
Coach Majors signed.Pedro
“Pistol Pete” Gonzalez.

During the time Gonzalez
was working out in the sum-
mer, the armchair quarterbacks
of Pittsburgh began questioning
his athletic ability, obviously
disappointed that Powlus did
not choose Pittsburgh.

But despite the constant pres-
sure, Gonzalez says that all the
comparisons between Powlus
and himself do not faze him.

“I always said [Powlus] is a
great quarterback,” Gonzalez
said. “Pitt was really interested
in him, but personally I feel
that I am better than him.

"Last season I threw for 1,500
plus yards and 17 touchdown
passes; _

"How much can you do in a
hurricane-abbreviated season
with seven games?"

Along with Gonzalez, Pitt
had still managed to give schol-
arships to 18 graduating high
school seniors by the end of
the recruiting season.

First-year placekicker Steve
Kalmanides enters the season
as the only rookie starting for
the Panthers. ~

Kalmanides, who kicked a
42-yard field goal in high
school, is not worried about
kicking on the Division 1 col-
legelevel.

“The only way for me to get A

the job done is for me to be
myself,” Kalmanides said. “lIfI
just] kick the way I have been
kicking all summer, I will be
fine.”

The area needing the most
improveinent from last year’s
team was the defensive back-

field, which gave up an aver- .

age of 191.6 yards per game
passing and 19 total passing
touchdowns in 1992.

Pitt managed to sign five of
the best high school defensive
backs, highlighted by starting
kick-off returner Denorse
Mosley.

Mosley, heavily recruited by
Florida, Florida State, Miami
and Michigan State was one of
the most sought-after defensive
back/punt returners in the
country, but chose Pitt
because of advice from his
high school coach.

“ll-Iigh school coach Mark

Kazonowitzl knows Coach

[Majors] personally and told me
if I came to Pitt and did well I

would get a lot of publicity,” -_
Mosley said. .
Mosley will not start in the

defensive backfield but will see
much action returning kick-offs
and punts — an area where he
excelled in high school, return-
ing six punts for touchdowns. ’

Other, Pitt rookie defensive
backs: ’

-Terence Binion, six-foot-
one-inch, 175—pounds.

During his junior season at
Ladue Horton Watkins High

School in Brentwood, Mo.,
Binion recorded a team-high
107 tackles, 79 of which were
solos while intercepting eight
passes. A

Binion saw his senior season
cut short by a broken arm.
Despite the injury, he~was still
named to the first team all-
Journal defensive team by the
Brentwood Citizens journal,
Brentwood’s local newspaper.

-John Jenkins, 6’-2”, 190-
pounds

Jenkins was the top defen-
sive back in the WPIAL last
season, intercepting 23 passes
at East Allegheny High School
and breaking former Panther
great Gordon Jones’ school
record. _

oKenyon Robinson, S’-11”,
200-pounds.

Robinson, who ran a 4.3 in

the 40-yard dash, possesses

incredible speed. A linebacker
in high school, Robinson was
recruited to play safety at Pitt.
Last season, Robinson was
Akron’s Defensive Player of the
Year after registering 106 tack-
les, forcing four fumbles,

deflecting two passes and regis-
tered 11 quarterback sacks.
-Michael Reece, 6’-1”, 175-
pounds
One of the best athletes on
the team, Reece is also one of

the most vocal. The St. Louis’ _

Athlete of the Year recorded 93
tackles and three interceptions
in high school, garnering hon-
orable mention All-American
honors.

Reece-is extremely vocal on
the field. Despite first-year sta-
tus, he has no problem with
talking trash on an‘ upperclass—
man.

“[I talk trash] because [my 2

teammates] are going to face it
in the game,” Reece said.

The first-year class of defen-
sive backs may not see starting

roles in the first couple of

games, but they already have

made an impact on the practice ,

field.
“I think all the freshman
[defensive backs] are great,”

Sumner said of Pitt's Class of

1997.
“They\ work hard, which
makes us work harder.”

games.  if if . I I

»“I.think I have to have a good game,”
Ryan said. “If I:go out there. and I don't
do the right things, the coaching staff
won’t hesitate to put another guy in or in
the next game think about starting
another guy.

"I. wantnto get to the point wherel
know I’m the guy  so there is no
doubt about who is going to be playing.”

Early in Pitt’s preseason camp, Ryan
said he thought it was important for the
team to settle on one quarterback. Wide
receiver Dietrich Jells expressed similar
sentiments then and Monday.

“I know I’m relieved, as a receiver, to
know there will be just one quarterback
and to know who it is before the last
minute,” Jells said.

Majors, however, hedged on the possi-
bility of playing Ferguson or Gonzalez

against Southern Miss., possibly an
attempt to leave the question of who will
play at quarterback as an open» issue in
the minds of the Golden Eagles.’

“Hopefully, that wasjust a little strate-
gy so they won’t be able to prepare, but
you never know with lMajorsl,” Ryan
said.

Majors did say that he always worried
about an opponent his team had not
faced before. In 1973, when "Majors
began his first tenure as Pitt’s head foot-
ball coach, the element of surprise was
one of the factors that allowed the
Panthers to upset Georgia.

“Southern Miss. will be better [than-

that Georgia teaml,” Majors said. “The
surprise element will not be as big a fac-
tor. We may be scrambling a bit more
with our team.” .
Jells said the new lineup and coaching
staff is a definite advantage for Pitt.
“They don’t know what to expect,”

Jells said. “I can’t say what we are going
to do, but it’s not going to be what we
did last year.”

Majors downplayed a “fear of the
unknown” on the part of Bower and the

_Golden Eagles. ‘‘I doubt they have much

fear of this unknown,” Majors said.

An outside factor that will effect both
teams will be the heat. Majors said that
playing in the evening should help, as
should the conditioning of his team. He
also talked about past games he had
coached when weather became a factor.

“Whenwe had good football players,
we did okay,” Majors said. “When we
didn't, we struggled.”

Majors said he was anxious to see
what will happen and offered up plenty
of talk about enduring whatever hap-
pens. “We’ll be around next week 
win, lose or draw  unless [Pitt Athletic
Director] Oval Uaynesl has other ideas
than I do,” Majors said.

Doyle said.

Cavanaugh was traded to the
San Francisco 49ers in 1983
and played there until 1985.
Public relations employee
Philip Green supplied informa-
tion from one of the 49.er’s
yearbooks.

“Matt was San Francisco’s
insurance policy in -case of
injury to Montana and was
solid as a rock in that capacity,”

 

. he said.

In 1986; Cavanaugh went to
the Philadelphia Eagles and
stayed in Philly until 1989. He
was again called onto be solid
in the backup QB role, this
time backing up Ron Jaworski.
He also provided a great deal

-of his knowledge of the game,

as recalled by Joe Wolley, the
Eagles head of player person-
nel.

“He was a very bright QB. I

felt he would make an out—.

standing football coach some
day for somebody,” Wolley
said.

Cavanaugh finished his NFL
playing career with the New

‘York Giants, where he arrived

in 1990. George Young, general
manager of the Giants, had
nothing but good, things to say
about Cavanaugh.

“When Matt came here, we
needed a solid, experienced
backup to work with the other
QBs. Matt was exemplary in
that role. He also helped out
the coaches tremendously. He
was a great asset, and he really
helped out the young guys,”
Young said.

Matt’s ability to someday
become a coach was also
apparent at that time to Young.

“I often thought Matt’s ambi-
.tion was to be the third base
coach with the Cleveland
Indians. He was an authority
on not only giving our signals
but figuring out the other
teams’ signals as well,” Young
said. . _
Matt retired from playing in
the NFL and took a year off to
spend some time with his fami-
ly.

Cavanaugh sees both his
experience in the NFL, as well
as his relationship with Coach
Majors, asan asset to the
Panthers. '

“I’d say it’s a combination of
both. But even though I played
for Coach Majors, I will still
have to do a good job. I’ll let
you know after this year  on
whether I enjoy coaching or
playing more. I am still in foot-
ball, and l have a chance to
teach and instill in others what
I have learned,” Cavanaugh
said. ’

Coach Majors believes
Cavanaugh is an excellent addi-
tion to the coaching staff and
reiterates what a great deal of
people who have worked with
Matt during his football career
have already stated. His posi-
tion will be tight ends coach,
and his responsibilities include
recruitingin the tri-state area.

“It's great to have [Matt] back
at the University of Pittsburgh,"
Majors said. “He’s good-heart-
ed, has a great background,
and he'll make an outstanding-
contribution to our program.”
