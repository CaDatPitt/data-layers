Dental Clinic Investigating Unique 5.
, Case Of Family VV ith ‘Rootiess Teeth’

 

By Arthur Ralsky §

The School of Dentistry today is%
investigating the case history of at
fa.mily in which three members havei
rootless teeth. 
A short time ago an 18-year-old girl 
came to the clinic of the school oni
Thackeray street to have a tooth ex-§
amined. An X-ray showed that a E
cyst was causing the pain, b11t not
roots could be seen. When the toothl
was ﬁnally extracted, it was root.less,§
as were the rest of the girl’s teeth. 
For further investigation, the girl'si
family was brought to the clinic. X-
rays showed the father's and the 14-l
year-old sister’s teeth to be 1'ootless.,l

Panthers Prance

Today To Music
Of Fran Eichler

Today is the day of the ﬁrst “Pan-
ther Prance.” Students will “prance,”
this afternoon at the Hotel Schenley
from 2:30 to 5:30 o'clock to the music
of Fran Eichler and his campus known
broadcasting orchestra.

None of the usual dance formalities
will prevail at the “Prance,” as every
second dance will be a cut-in. Pro-
grams will enable the coeds to keep
their men i11 order, but the men may
ignore programs during the cut-in
numbers.

Today's “Pra.nce” is the outgrowth
of a suggestion made in the SFA as-
sembly for a student dance with a
price that would appeal to a large
number of students. Jack Hammer-
schmidt, C35, was selected to" work
with the SPA social committee on the
project.

Chaperons named for today's affair

include Dr. and Mrs. Vincent W. Lan-
fear, Mr. and Mrs. Theodore W. Bid-
dle, Mr. and Mrs. Clyde Barton, N.
Robert Seidle, Miss Thyrsa VV. Amos,
Miss Helen Rush, and Miss Isabelle
Anderson.

The ﬁrst ﬂoor lounge and check
rooms of the hotel will be available
for use by students. Admission to the
dance ﬂoor will be by payment of 25
cents plus registration card or per-
sonal recognition.

 

Placemenl -Bureau Needs

Male, Shorthand Experts

The University Placement bureau,
according to J. C. Barton, director,
was unable to supply six men to take
responsible ‘positions with com1ner-
cial ﬁrms because no one was listed
in the bureau application ﬁles with a
working knowledge of shorthand, the
main requisite of the position.

There have been more calls, propor-
tionally, in the last six months ask-
ing for male secretaries than there
have been forany other position.

process, a bony attachment, and the
gum tissue. Cavities had been pre-
pared and ﬁlled in many of the
teeth. .,
Only one other case of rootlessi
teeth has ever been reported in dental ?
literature. This one, found in Ger-Q
many in 1920, showed a patient whose 
teeth were falling out.
Dr. Eselman, Dr. W‘. F. Swanson, as-§
sistant professor of histology and bac-;
teriology, and Dr. E. G. Meisel, pro-§
fessor of clinical dental pathology and 
radiology, recently presented papers}
on this case before the American Col-;
lege of Dentists, afﬁliated with the’
American Association for the Ad-
vancement of Science. 
The case now is being traced byl
these doctors through four generations l
of the family. There are two girls,g

34 Activity Heads
To Select Winner
Of Druid Plaque

Men '3 Sophomore Honorary Plans
Annual Award For Leading
Second Year Student

To encourage sophomore participa-
tion in extracurricular activities, and
to raise the standard of participation
of sophomores already active, the
latest project of Druids. national hon-
orary sophomore activities fraternity,
has been disclosed.

A plaque, which will hang perma-
nently in the ofﬁce of the dean of men,
Room 801, Cathedral, or in any other
room designated as activities head-
quarters, will be supplied by Druids
and on it each year will be inscribed
the name of the outstanding sopho-
more in activities, as elected by an
impartial vote coiidlicted among 34
student leaders and administration
aides.

A deﬁnite plan was proposed by Ed-
win Beachler, C37, chairman of. the
project, at the last meeting of Druids,
the meeting in which Dale Van Ormer,
E37, was ousted from office and Ernest
Rose, C37, vice president, succeeded
to the presidency. The idea was orig-
inally suggested in December.

, “To Remedy Lethargy"

It is the opinion of Druids that. in
the past sophomores have shown a
lethargic interest in activities, and it
is to remedy this condition that the
plaque idea has been adopted.

For consideration, men must be in
their third or fourth semester, must
have maintained a quality point aver-
age. of 1.0, and must have carried 12
credits each semester..

The actual election is entirely out
of Druid hands, other than the routine
work in arranging the procedure. All
activities leaders will be asked to
serve-as both a nominating and elec-
tion board, which will also include:
Dr. Vincent W. Lanfear, dean of men;
Theodore W. Biddle, assistant dean of
men; and N. Robert Seidle, assistant
to the dean of men.‘

As the nominations are submitted
by the board, a special committee
composed of two activities leaders
elected by Druids, two Druid members
elected internally, and Dr. Lanfear,
will cut the list down to ten.
names of these ten will be submitted

again to -the nominating -board of’-~34,—~

and will be elected through a system
of voting which Dr. James :“C; Charles-
worth, assistant professor of political
science, will be asked to devise or
recommend.
Leaders Tally Ballots

Tellers, in computing the ballot re-
turns, will be the president of the
Women's Self Government Associa-
tion, the president of Cwens, women's
honorary sophomore activities frater-
nity, Mr. Seidle, Lieutenant D. C.
Tredennick, assistant professor of
military science and‘ tactics, and’ the
president of the Student. Faculty Asso-
ciation. The results will be sealed
and delivered to the .. president . of
Druids, for release during Spring Fes-
tival tap-ping ceremonies. ‘

The men who will comprise the
nominating and election board, he-
sides Dr. Lanfear, Lieutenant. Treden-
nick, Mr. Biddle, and Mr. Seidle, are
those who hold the following offices:

The editors and business managers
of The Pitt News, the Pitt Panther,
and the Owl; editor, Dental Rays; the
presidents of SFA, College Associa-

Name Of New Cap And Gown Director
To Be Disclosed Soon, Says Biddle

“Within ten days," asserts Theo-
dore VV. Biddle, assistant dean of
men and chairman of Cap and Gown
production, “the University all-male
show will have a director."

Such a remark at this time last
year would have been something less
than epoch-making, for Bill Marlatt
had by then signed for his ﬁfth affair
here-, and several:-sttident skits had
already been accepted. -

But the 1935 event has not been
so fortunate. First Marlatt, pressed
by a heavy schedule in the East, wrote
that he could not come back. Then
students were invited to write scripts
for a. continuous plot. The last meet-
ing of the organization’s production
committee refused all ﬁve manuscripts
entered, declaring that the books
“lacked strong dialogue, humorous
situations, and plot build-up.”

So far had uncertainty about the
show gone that rumors of its cancella-
tion were current on campus last
week. Nothing further had been

heard from the production committee .

after its rejection of the undergradu-
ate work, and deﬁnite information re-
garding the choice of a director was
lacking until yesterday.

. ‘-‘The Graduate club has already, made
tentative plans to put on the show the
week of April 22 at the Nixon Thea-
ter,” said Mr. Biddle. Another meet-
ing of’ the club will take place in the
Hotel Schenley this evening.
Although the submitted plots of
Everett Pickering, BA35, Bernard
Zerbe, C37, Omer Kronenwetter, C35,
Herrymon Maurer, C36. and Robert
Davis, C36, will not be used in their
entirety, it is said that the book will
embody parts of the ﬁve scripts.

For B_al_l__ Friday

300 Couples Expected To Attend
Formal At Hotel Schenley

Two days remain for the sale of
tickets for Friday night’s Interfrater-
nity Ball. ,

The highlight of the Greek calendar
for the year takes place at the Hotel
Schenley from 9:30 to 2 o’clock, with
Emerson Gill's NBC and Columbia
broadcasting orchestra booked to play.
Gill is bringing along Marian Mann,
prominent torch singer on Gil1’s NBC
programs, and “Pinky” Hunter, who
achieved renown as a crooner long be-
fore Vallee and Osborn got their press
agents busy.

A special ticket-booth in Alumni
ball will be open for business from
11:30 to 2 o’clock tomorrow and Fri-
day at which regular tickets will be
on sale for $3.50 per couple. Reserva-
tion tickets, at $1.50, are also avail-
able, the remaining $2 to be paid at
the door Friday night.

The sale of tickets and reservations

will also continue until 5 o’clock Fri-

day afternoon in the oflice of the dean
of men, Room 801, Cathedral, and also
with committee members in the vari-
ous fraternity houses.

To date, an encouraging number of
fraternity and non-affiliated men have
purchased tickets, indicating that the
attendaiice will‘ probably reach: a‘ min-
imum of 300 couples, according to Mel-
vin Carnahan, BA35, Phi Delta Theta,
chairman.

No ‘information on favors was ob-
tainable from the chairman, other
than the fact that they will be about
one-third more expensive than those
distributed last year. Carnahan ex-
pressed conﬁdence that feminine pa-
trons will ﬁnd the favors attractive.
“Incidentally, they really will be dif-
ferent this time!” he insisted.

The committee includes:

Robert Willison, BA3-5, Delta Tau
Delta, business manager; VVi1liam
Dornenberg, C36, Phi Kappa; Robert,

Success For Bill
On Public Works

The huge administration program
l'01‘ 31 $4,000. 000.000 appropriation for
public works will apparently be en-
acted at the present session of Con-
gress, Dr. Frances D. Tyson, professor
of economics, intimated Monday.

The only difficulty, he said, would
be found in administering these funds,
together with a.n additional $300,000,-
000 of *Cc«ngressionally controlled
money for federal public works." Di-
recting the 3,500,000 employable un-
employed men from relief rolls to work
will present a problem to the legisla-
tors.

The economic security program,
embodying unemployment insurance
and old age pensions, will also go
through, according to Dr_ Tyson.

“Unemployment insurance,” he
said, “may take the form of a federal
subsidy to states passing laws meet-
mg minimum standards; it may also
be tied up with a. 3 per cent excise
tax on industrial pay rolls, as provid-
ed in the Wagner-Lewis bill at the
last session.”

In regard to old age pensions. Dr.
Tyson believes that efficient action
is almost inevitable, This is the re-
sult of _the wide popular support for
and Congressional interest in the
Townsend bill which he terms “ec-
onomically absurd.”

University's Resolutions
Adopted At Convention

Among the resolutions adopted b_v
discussion groups at the annual con-
vention of the Pennsylvania A.‘ss<))c1a-
tion of College Students. held at Ienn
State last week-end were several pre-
sented by the University’s delegates,
Leonard Marks, ‘C35, chairman of the
University Assembly. and Charles
Herald, C36, member of the Executive
committee. '

Two of the proposals advocated by
Marks and Herald are already in force
on the University campus. One was
the upperclassman adviser system as
a. means of freshman orientation; the
other is the elimination of all ele-
ments of ridicule and hazing in fresh-
man customs.

The Association, an organiza..tion of
student. body presidents of major col-
leges and Universities in the-State,
was addressed by John Lang, presi-
dent of the National Student Federa-
tion.

All Of Which Goes
To Show . . .

There maybe challengers to
the title, but Miss lviary Milburn,
secretary to the dean of men, is
said to know more about college
students, especially the male vari-
ety. than any other person at-
tached to the University.

Recently, in a special English
course which Miss Milburn is tak-
ing, a theme was assigned on
“College students."

When class met, there was no
theme from the well-informed sec-
retary.

“You surely know enough about
the subject, don't you?” she was
asked. “Then why no theme?”

“Too many ‘College students’
keeping me busy," she replied.
“I didn't have time.” ‘ 

Work On $500,000

Memorial Begins
With Sod-Lifting
Foster Shrin-Zr’-1‘—d_House Famous

Lilly Collection Of Exhibits
Now In Indianapolis

Completed Witliin Year

An architeot’s drawing of the
Stephen Foster Memorial appears
on page four.

 

A small broken plot of ground
at the corner of Forbes street and
Bigelow boulevard today marks
the spot where a year from now
a massive $500,000 memorial will
stand, a shrine. built by mnslc
lovers over the country in mem-
ory of Stephen Collins Foster.

Sunday afternoon on the 71st anni-
versary of the composer’s death, the
ground was broken which officially
opened work on the memorial.

Today the University checks over
last details of plans while workmen
complete lifting sod from the ground.
Actual digging of the foundation is
expected to begin by February 1, ac-
cording; to John Weber, business man-
ager of the University.

The 70-foot high limestone memor-
ial, when completed, will have a main
auditorium seating 800, a foyer 18 by
-50 and a hexagonal shrine 40 feet in
diameter.

Entire Collection Housed

The auditorium will be 68 feet
square and will have at one end an
orchestral pit and a 54-foot stage.
The shrine will contain the famous
Dr. Josiah K. Lilly collection of Fos-
ter memorials, one of the most com-
plete in the world. ‘

Dr. Lilly has the -collection at a me-
morial built in the suburbs of Indian-
apolis. He has granted the use of the
entire set which will be kept as part.
of the permanent exhibit in the‘ shrine
of the Foster Memorial.

Part of this collection is now on ex-
hibition on the third floor of State
hall. Nineteen different pieces make
up the set, outstanding among which
are three volumes of all the composi-
tions the late composer wrote. Each
song is an exact reproduction of the
original.

The F‘oster Memorial, funds for
which were raised. by the Foster Me-
morial Association in conjunction
with the national Tuesday Musical
club, will be 143 feet long and 63 feet
wide. The entrance will face Forbes
street.

Auxiliary Rooms included

In the basement of the Memorial
will be a. social room, dressing rooms
and a kitchen. Where original ﬁrst
editions cannot be obtained, photosta-
tic copies will be taken to be exhibit-
ed. permanently in the shrine.

Another -feature of the collection
will be the biography, Stephen Foster
-—America’s Troubadour, by John Tas-
ker Howard. So- complete is this
work that according to critics it
seems unlikely’ that another life of
Stephen Collins Foster will ever be
needed.

Stephens‘ Portable Melodeon, a.
small wooden piano-organ, also will
come with the Lilly collection. The
composer, it is believed, worked out
many of his compositions on this in-
strument up to the time of his death
in 1864, when he was 38 years old.

One page of Foster’s account book
lists “Receipts on Music” which il-
lustrates the ‘value of his pieces. For
“Old Folks at Home” the composer
received $1,647.46 in sales. “My Old
Kentucky Home” brought $1,372.06 and
“Old Dog Tray” a sum of $1,080.25.
the total for 20 pieces listed on the
page was $9,062.25.

Pro-Examination Holidays
Tll'O VVEEKS FR-OM TODAY a. majority of the

lTniversit.y’s deserving students will find them-
selves with a. short. inter-semester holiday. It will
be a short-enough boon after the intensiﬁed sched-
ules and headaches of examination week, but long
enough for students to get. the fumes of midnight
coffee out of the brain. 1

An interesting use of the days usually set. aside
for an inter-scmeslzer holiday is being made by cer-
tain universities, most of them in the “lost. ap-
parently; where two or three days have been allot-
ted for a pre-examination recess. Among schools
which have lately considered the plan is the Uni-
versitv of Minnesota. Students and members of
the falculitv are represented as being highly en1‘_hus-
iastic over a. program that would suspend classes
about four days before the beginning of examina-
tions. - A

The University should consider the application
of a similar recess here. Doubtlcss the suggestion
comes too late to be effective this winter, since 
fairly rigid schedule has been established for the
rlistrilnitioii of class hours throughout the semes-
tcr. But we believe a. majority of students would
warmly approve such a plan at the end of May.

For The Present

FOR THE PRESENT the intramural basketball

lea guc plan is the best that can be arranged. It
offers athletic participation to more than a hun-
drcd men who have either not the time or not the
talent for varsity basketball, and if it does not
provide for even greater participation the reason
is a. complex of lack of time, lack of equipment and
lack of playing ﬂoors.

\Ve believe with a certain arithmetical dogged-
ncss that the more students who are able to ﬁnd
;-:_,vmnasium and ﬁeld exercise this win’rc1’. the bet-
ter. Nothing would satisfy us like frcblcd phys-
ical education facilities. with innumerable basket-
ball. handball and indoor tennis courts. And there
should be at least one more swinn11in.g pool.

\Ve agree that those advantages should be defer-
red until the Uniersily is able to pay its good in-
structors what they deserve, able to bring good
men from elsewhere and to stimulate graduate
work with a number of effective fellowships.
But in the meantime, we propose the cx’ren—
sion of the intramural basketball plan. Let the
swimming pool become available to s‘lu(leni.S, and
student groups during late afternoon or evening‘
periods. Put. a few FERA lifeguards on duty if

Hearsfs ‘Red Scare’ I
HE HE-ARS’.l‘ rnuss HAS embarked upon a 2
campaign which threatens every vestige of in- 3

dependent thought and action in Anicrican c-duca-

tion.

Carried on in the name of An1c1'icanism,”
which Mr. Hearst so conveniently adopts to shield
his endeavors, it is represented as a drive to “ex-
posc communism in the s-cl1ools."’

There is grave evidence, however, that the hys-
teria is directccl. not against a single political ele-
ment. but against all dissenting tliouglii. It does
not distinguisli between faint pink and deep red.
lt classiﬁes liberals and radicals alike as “public
encInies”—’ro be invcst.igate(l, then imprisoned or
(l.vporic(l. It is a (le.libcrat.e, ruthless attempt to
stifle freedom of inquiry and expression and to im-
pose upon American education the terror which
cha.ractcrizes cduca.tion in Germany.

Thus far Mr. Hearst has concentrated his fury
at Syracuse and Columbia universities where be
assigned agcnts to spy on professors suspected of
“radical tendencies.” At Columbia‘.' his efforts
were bared by Professor Geoixge S. Counts, who .
forced a reporter to admit ili-at “tlic Hearst papers
are now stirrin,-9; up a ‘Red Sca.rc’."' These steps,
he confessed, are part. of a. nation-wide scheme, ap-
parently aimed at. the ouster of all those crlucators
who challenge the precepts of Mr. Hearst. and tho
super-patrioltic machine he svinboliz-ces.

Mr. Hearst exerts real inﬂuence in America. His
activities, however ludicrous and fantastic tlicy
may appear, reach millions of readers throiiglioiit
the country. He can, in alliance with other “1OO
per cent American” organizations, so provoke and
bcwilder the great body of American people that
independent rcsearcli and dissenting_ opinion will
be summarily banished.

Mr. Hearst is a menace to academic freedom
which stuclcnts and faculty have fought. so many
bitter struggles to preserve. Now, more than ever,
in a world fraught. with disorder and insecurity,
its preservation is most vital. Mr. Hearst declares
that he is scckiuo; to keen the mind of youth
“clean and wholesome.” We contend tliiat he is
advocating the academic goose step. ‘CV9. believe
that the economic and political facts of life should
be open to scrutiny, analysis and decision; we see
in Mr. Hearst’s policies an attempt to suppress
anv considcraﬁon of them. ‘ ,

Faced with this crusade of reaction and aware
of the disaster it forcshadows, we pledge our .force.s
to combat it. Vile condemn Mr. Hcarst’s “Red
Scare” and the supcr—pat.riot.ic devices he is em-
ploying to achieve his ends. The signatories to
this statement represent widely divcrgent., con-
ﬁicting political beliefs. 'We. are in accord, how-

String Ensemble Presents
Unusual Music For Patrons

By Herrymon Maurer ,

FRIEND OF MINE once said that it was foolish to

deprecate that which one does not understand. Per-
haps one might say that that which a normal person
does not understand ought to be deprecated. I might apply
this last maxim to painting or literature, ﬁelds in which
I pretend a Sli_L_’,'l1l'. knowledge, but my ignorance cautions
me when I think of the ﬁeld of music. Besides, we have
all been irked when a friend says, “I dcn’t know any-
lhiug about it but I know what I like.” VVe feel that our
f1'iend’s taste is poor, or sentimental, or shallow. In try-
ing to attempt a discussion of last Fridz-iy’s concert by
ihc String Symphonic Ensemislo Society of Pittslmrgh, I
sha.ll_tl1c1'efo1°c try to free myself from the prejuclices of
the ignorant, for I know nothing about music.

Only One In Country '

The nature of the String Symphonic Ensemble de-
serves comment at once, since it is the only organiza-
tion of the kind in the country. Its size enables it to
undertake compositions more complex than those writ-
ten for a string quartet. Since it is smaller than a
symphony orchestra, it is enabled to present composi-
Lions more ﬂuid. It has not the unwieldiness of the
straight symphonic group, and therefore can introduce
works of less known composers, not to speak of "those
works written particularly for a String Symphonic 
semble. .

At a rehearsal of an earlier concerl; of the Ensemble
1 was very happily introduced to a composil.ion—l forget
what it w-a:—by the composer Suk, of whom I had never
lieard, but whose. music xvas stimulating. On Friday I
was again introducecl to music by composers of whom I
knew nothing, but the music was of a dift'c1'ent sort. To
those who had a. knowledgze of music the selections
must have been intellectually stimulating; I, however.
was listening to something: v.-‘hich was quite over my
head. My -mind was stimulated, but lack of knowledge
prevented a complete enjoyment. -

The ﬁrsithalf of the program was somewhat long and
rather delicate; and my prejudices in music—-which are
without any foundation——lead me to like music which is
masculine and to the point. I felt a. little tired. I-‘Vc
heard before the intermission the Symphonic Soirituelle
of Asgar Hamerik and a Serenade by Bernard Sekles.

Painting And Music

In the second half I found more enjoynient. The
technical genius of the Italian composer, Rcspiglii, was
evident. He had drawn inspiration from three paintings
by the Renaissance artist Botticelli——Sp1'ing. the Adora-
tion of the Magi, and the Birth of Venus. Botticelli, be
it said, lived at the high point of the revival of learn-
ing. His paintings Show none of the spiritual sincerity
of Giotto. Their atinosphere, besides, is different from
the realistic atniospherc of the middle-age sculptors. In
them there is :2 grace and scnsi1.oiisnoss: there is an ap-
peal to the intellect through an opportunity for the en-
ioynieiit of tec'nni<1ue. Botticr-lli serves as a. point of
departure. Respiglii succeeded in catching the atmos-
plicre of the pa_.intinfzs and presenting it i.l1l‘Ol‘L‘-{ll the
idiom of modern music. Bocriuse of my little acquaint-
ance with the niaterials with which the composcr works,
I missed an opportunity for increased mental enjoy-
ment; for Respiyhi, like Botticelli, int.cntiona_lly pr-3-sents
this opportunity. I was irked at my inability to receive
all that the music offered.

I mcommend the String F;y1npl1onic assemble to thosn,
who delight in analysis of the way music is put to-
,:;cther, who admire the gifted 1111117111’: of a violin or 3
cello or a bassoon, who rippreciate the skill of the in-
trrpretation of "-1 compeizent conductor. The Ensemble
offers op-port.uni"cies fornew acquaintance in certain
ﬁelds of music. It offers enJ'0."m911t to T110313 W110 like
to hear music played well. Pittsburgh is fortunate in
having such a group of musicians, and fortunate are we
in having the opportunity to enjoy further concerts this

seaso1i—-to be given on March 1 and April 12."

Lloyd Reviews Joyful

Revels of Sophomores,

Freshmen In ’25

 

By Alan C. Lloyd

HE FRESHMAN THAT came to Pitt in 1925 came to a

school of pros-

pects, for that was the year of the Cathedral drive, the opening of the

Stadium, the radio broadcasts, and hopes.

They ca.me eagerly, this class

of ’29, in numbers so large that the registrar reported an increase of 500
personsfand those leading the Cathedral drive said, “In another decade our
enrollement will reach ten thousand. Let us prepare even beyond that!”

At that time the Pitt ‘Neekly was issued on‘VVe‘dnesdays and sold 0

and alumni journal of the University’

of Pittsburgh," the fo1'erunner of both:

The Pitt News and the Pittsburgh Rec-
ord; an eight-page paper. I happened
to run across the Pitt Weekly In its

the top of the page, inch i1(3a.L'illl1€:S

It was the “Official student%

road, “Pitt's New Stadiiini Awaits Sat-;

urda,v’s Opening Grid Battle.”
the load article, and found it full of
statistics, “Seventh largest in
United States bowl
acres . . gridiron .
seats . . . Bowl .
pavilion . . and baseball ﬁeld -.
for track, and tennis and handiball
courts ‘ our slogan: Push the
Panthers!" It was a. proud editor that
wrote that article.
Our Cathedral

In the second headline, I learned
that “'Cathedral*drive reopens . . .
Construction to start . . plans have

progressed through the summer.” And

they were all agog over the fact that
4-0 feet below surface there was a ﬁne
solid
the engineers reported. Happy engi-
neers! ' " ‘

In another corner I saw that there
was to be a. “Lantern Night Cere-
mony” to “honor the freshmen wo-
men.” I looked closely at a picture of
the “Bowl.” as the paper usually called
the Stadium, and drifted down below
it,‘ to across the first modern news
"Enforcement of Freshman Rules Still
Unde«_=.idod." Bearing in mind the
problem now confronting the Customs
committee of SFA, I read the article.
The issue lay in the management and
agency of discipline; of‘ the advisabil-
ity of customs nothing was said. Quot
ing the Vveekly, “The Druids, sopho-
more honorary fraternity for men, has
announced that it will 1:a.ke the respon-
sibility to bring the frosh to terms!"
And further quoting,

‘Meanwhile an unofficial self-
appointed body has’ been active
during the opening days of school
in seeing that the first-year men
are kept on an uncomfortable go
wherevertirhey show themselves on
campus . . . -

“Need for an organized cam-
paign against the insurgents that
are cropping up even this early in
the year was expressed by stu-
dents on campus." The ‘rest of
the article concerns tl1e.17 rules

for Freshmen: “Dinks ‘, .’ black
sex and ties . . songs and yells
registration cards all

assemblies no high school

football section , _ etc.” ~

These rules are all well organized,
and could be utilized even today. They
are practical and sane. The trouble
lies in their enforcement, of course,
and this was as large a {job then as to-
day. In answer t.o the problem, the
Druids. it seemed, offered to “bring the
frosh to terms!” and to keep them
“uncomfortable.” And it was in val-
iant service to this same issue that
the "unofficial self’-appointed group"
were functioning.

I wondered at the time what this
patriotic band had achieved, and I ul-
‘imately found a. reporter’s story hid-
den beneath the tame headline,
“Frosh Bow to Rule of Sophs in Rec-
ord Breaking P-ara.de." It is a face-
tious, superior, boisterous account. In
ieresting, I thought it: “The most
impressive and painful. Pitt freshman
parade in years was opened Monday
by a mob of sophomores who stam-
pedcd the “Freshies” in their class-
os.” .

Mob? Oh no, just, a conscientious,
well-moaning body which had but the
best interests of the school at heart;
11; merely unfortunate that the
hearis were har-zl.

“Herded into line, their pant-
legs rolled up, their purple lined
coats exposed, and chair blue and
gold dinks on, they were marched
in front of the Dental‘ Inﬁrmary
to run a gauntlet of sophomores.”
Truly an impressive sight. No

doubt it made every frosh thrill with
pride. As the Chane-cllor looked at
the drawings of the Cathedral that lav
before him»-the plans that would
raise the intellect of Pittsburgh-——h-3
doubtless heard the clamor and en-
joyed it.

"Twice the newcomers ran to
gauntlet while barrel staves and pad-
dles cracked and cameras clicked.”
Notice, please, the excellent stvle in
which the article is wri‘ten. “Crack-
ed” and “clicker;l" are ﬁne, connotativo
words, showing the delica.c,V of word

now wilted freshmen were herded and

This was a very good adver'i;isemen1-
for the University, and doubtless the
associates were impressed with the
dauntless spirit of the tireless sopho-
bigbrotherliness had
aided the lads through the vicissitudes
of the march.’ I do not quite under-
s‘ and what the writer had meant by
“wilted,” though.
Townsend Lloyd’s Plan

“After a review of all the Pitt yells
and a few original ones, the line was
formed again and the march resumed.
Twice again the line ran the gauntlet
while their tired and bruised bodies
were given one more ﬁnal ﬂailing and
the great parade of 19.95 was a. thing
of the past.” Boy! the writer certain-
ly got over that parade quickly. He
should not have written the article
like this. He should have written a
book, and sold it. to be produced in
Hollywood. Think what a movie it
would make. Humor! Patnos! 13-:m-.-
life! \’Vhy, with the four Marx broth-
ers in the lead roles. this would be
a sensation. Especially the fourth
time they ran the gauntlet. People
everywhere would ﬂock to see it.
Movies would do a. gigantic business.
For them, the depression would be
ovor and the management would in-
crease salaries. The reaction would
be spontaneous, and the present alpha-
bet put out of use! An editorial ac-
companied the story, saying in all
seriousness:

“We hate to think how disap-
pointed the frcsh \-vould have been
if he had not been taken out and
thoroughly spanked. ‘He was look-
ing forward to it_ He had been for
months. It was part and parcel

‘Picture-Moral ’
Drives /ire Bane
Of Journalism

By Edwin P. Banks

‘EV.-\;F’. BE IT from me to advocate a

board of censorship over the jour-
nalism industry. Far be it from me
to brand the daily n<.-wspapers and
popular magazines as immoral. But
I trust I may safely suggest that a.
certain new phase of the business is
decidedly h_vpocritica1.

A Pittslmrgli daily has begun run-
ning‘ its latest series. of pictures for
the moral ediﬁcation of the public.
Previously, this paper along with the
other local dailies had carried a sim-
ilar series, depicting the “horrors of
war.” This time the gruesome conse-
quences of crime are being revealed
pictorially.

‘Machine Guns And Orchids

of this
people

The announced purpose
series is ‘to make the good
realize that crime, my clears, does
not pay. Once more, the hundred
percent Anic-rican press is contribut-
ing a vital public service, and so on.
The readers are viewing the blood,
the little black holes, the disordered
clothes, the placid repose of the death,
and more blood. By this activity,
they are to learn that the gangster‘,
while he may have many, many
orchids for his funeral, cannot appre-
ciate lovely ﬂowers when he is
sheathing half a dozen machine gun
pellets.

1 have the suspicion that the pub-
lishers of newspapers which are fea-
turing this series, and the publishers
of the “true” detective periodicals are
not greatly interested in the moral
value of the pictures. They are
la.ug'liing up their sleeves over the
righteousblurbs they write to cap-
tion the sickening stuff.

The publishers know that the
masses have a curiosity with a morbid
twist. The people will spend their
pennies to buy these delightful photo-
,e;1'a.1)hs and shudder deliciously as
they look at them. The people are
buying.

Have you ever seen an advertise-
ment by certain companies whose
business is dedicated tothe dissemina-
tion of beauty? These companies sell
pamphlets or niagazines containing
Dh0l30g1"aD11s of ladies minus the im-
pedlm-ants of clothing. The photo-
graphs are described as entrancing
art studies appealing to the aesthetic
taste of every real lover of “thing
artistic.” "
Exposed Nudists

Have you seen a recent issue of a
periodical which “exposed” the
ﬂag!-aiit iininotrality of nudist colo-
nies? Illustrating the charges were
pictures “exposin9,"’ the buck-to-nah
lure individuals themselves. All for
the spiritual. uplifting of the readers,
of course.

But I am perfectly aware that it is
futile to protest against such sugar-
C-0a'L'ed h;Yp0crisy. - The journalism
racket will continue to be saturated
with it, because the public in general
doesn't, give a damn v.bout,it anyway.
In fact, the-chances are that they pre-
fer it as it is. Vlfatch a debutante tak-
ing a picture of a gangster putrifying
in his blood. Watch her greedy eyes,
and then hear her exclaim, “Oh, isn’t
it :1.wful.” And watch the young male
art lovers improving their aesthetic
faculty at the magazine stand.

There is a great deal of room for
forcible protest, however, against a.
much more despicable kind of journal-
istic hypocrisy. And that kind is con-
cerned with such proposals as a con-
tinued high protective tariff to safe-
guard the American workman and op-
position to trade unionism in order to

\-Vith a ﬁne chance to give Gothaui cage followers a lesson on

tloor tonight to face the Fordhani Rams in the first. game of a. sched-

p:‘O'L)ai_)ly be one of the largest crowds?
of the current season, expected to go i_

well over the 16,000 mark. I
In their game wit.h the Rams, the;
Panthers will be out to end the short!
slump which found the team drop-ping’
two of the last three games, some-
thing highly unusual for a. Carlson-
coached outﬁt. Since returning from
their second lVIid-western trip, the
team has been unable to click as
Coach Carlson would like it to do.
On the other hand, Coach Vinnie
Cavanagh has also experienced diffi-
culty in moulding a winning Fordham
ﬁve. His team has been playing in-
consistent ball throughout the season.
To date, the Rams have been unable
to play .500 ball, winning only two of
their five games. For their two vic-
tories, Fordham whipped Seventh Reg-
iment and Loyola, while dropping
games to Columbia, Navy and NY-U.
Cavanagh’s main problem t-lies'in the
fact that he has two ﬁves of almost
equal ability and so far has not found
a combination that will click together.
Fordham Five Experienced

In the ﬁve previous tilts, the Ford-
ham coach has used a varsity made
up for the most part of last season's
letterinen and reserves. At the two
forward posts are Drury, a sophomore
sensation, and Fritzche, a reserve re-
turning from last year. Drury, in the
game with Seventh Regiment, scored
16 points, and has been a standout
performer in all other games. He is
an accurate shot and an extremely
clever ﬁoorman. Young, a veteran
.t‘rom last season, holds down the cen-
ter position, while teaming at the
guard posts are Captain DePhillips
and O’Connor. DePliillips, a. senior
and lotterman, rates as the individual
high scorer on the Ram squad this
season.

Despite the inability of his present
first string ﬁve to click regularly,
Coach Carlson will stand pat on the
varsity that has started. the previous
nine games this season. Co-captains
Skippy Iughes and Clair Cribbs will
team again at I‘orwards, giving the
Panthers :1. strong combination at
these positions- Cribbs, who scored
15 points against Temple Saturday
night, now is but three points behind
Paul Birch oi‘ Duque_sne, for the city
lead in scoring. High Pete Noon
again gets the call at the pivot post,
wliil-e at guards Ross Emrick and Ted
Roderick will probably start, the
game.

The Panthers, in the game with
I‘-‘ordhain, will be out trying for their
seventh victory in 10 games to date.
Dr_ Carlsons boys have taken Buck-
hell, Iowa, Butler, Wisconsin, Tech
and Indiana for a. ride, while they
were taken by Duquesne, Northwest-
ti-T11 and Temple. The Eastern jaunt
to meet Fordham tonight marks the
Pa,nthers’ second Eastern trip within
the last six days. '

Banking. On Glass

The Panthers will be shooting
ftsainst something new in the way of
banlzboards in tonight's game as they
will be banking their shots on an all-
glass back board. The new “boards,"
recently installed, are made of glass
so as not to obstruct the view of the
cash-paying customers. The Panthers
may have to take quite a. few prac-
tice shots to become accustomed to
shooting into the spectators behind
the bankboard.

It is somewhat amusing to imagine
the prospect of co-captain Hughes

-$_a}_'ii1:;§ to_ co-captain -Cribbs, “Well,
Urlbby. old hey. if you just bank it,
against that fat gii_v’s boiled shirt over!
there to the left, it’ll go in sure.” And

Cribbs might answer, “But when
E-'0u‘re around the foul line it’s a
(-inch bucket if you plop the ball

against the beret on that blonde up
there.”

Notre Dame Comes Next
Another great battle looms up on

the ‘Panther schedule for Saturday
ﬂight, when the Fighting Irish of
N0‘il'e Dame come to town. Last year

the Panthers put an end to a lengthy
victory streak of the South Berfders
in one of the most tlirilling games
"3-‘"91’ l31'<l~3’€-Cl at the stadium pavilion.

Later Dr. Carlson took his men out
to South Bend’ and licked the Irish
on their home ﬂoor before a packed
house. That was the night when
{.‘1I£11‘19y H.11g‘l1es went down with the
é?.Tll)l‘=~"> and was kept out of the game.
Despite Cliarley’s absence, the Pan.
ihers dazzled the Notre Dame outfit
with a passing attack that was ex-
cellent plus.

.’.l_‘li-'3 iiienicry of these two defeats
still bothers M_r. George Keogan, coach
of the Irish. A Pitt follower who hap-
pened to attend several practice ses-
sions at Notre Dame during the
Christmas holidays reports that the
Irish are pointing for the Panthers
aiiove all other teams on their sched-
u e.

All of which puts a little more spice

into the lives of Carlson and his ball-
players.

Track Workouts

Great, .Kirkpa.t-rick, Bonavita. Do
Well In Weekly Tryouts

Injuries, colds. illness. and studies‘
have cropped up among members of!
the track team to slow up daily prac-
tice sessions at the track house.

Harold Connelly was put on the
shelf for a. few days as a result of an
injury to his ank.‘-.e. He expects to re-
turn to workouts sometime this week.
Several members of the team have
been siitfe1'iiig from heavy
which have hampered their rounding
into shape.

Assistant coach James Potts has
been on the sick list for the past few
days, being conﬁned to his home with
inﬂuenza. He’ll probably be back in
harness by the end of the week.
Fleming, star sprinter and hurdler,
has also been on the sick list.

Those who have been fortunate to
escape colds and whatnot have been
busy trying to prepare for their ﬁnal
exams.

In spite of these drawbacks, Coach
Olson has had several things happen
that have pleased him a great deal.
One was Bud Groat’s ﬁne showing in
the tryouts for the mile-relay team.
Croat ran the 440 in the fast time of
253.8, just a few seconds above the rec-
ord for that distance.

In trial runs for positions on the
two’ and four mile relay outﬁts,
Charles Kirkpatrick turned in a re-
spectable run of four minutes, 38 sec-
onds for the mile run. The track
house record for this distance is 4
minutes, 33 seconds, made by Ken
‘Wagenhouser last year.

Bonavita has hit the 45-foot mark
in the shot put event several times.

Mittrhen Prepare
For Orange Team

 

Schricker Puts Squad Through
Tapering-Oﬁ‘ Process

Leather has been flying fast and
furious around the ring in the stadium
as the boxers get in their last few
licks of practice before the Syracuse
match Saturday night at Syracuse,
New York.

Coach Schricker sent the entire
iast week before he started the taper-
ing-off process which will have the
boxers in the pink of condition when
they step between the ropes to face
the most adept Syracuse boxers.

Yesterday afternoon Schricker had
the pugilists going at 3, fast cup
through a somewhat reduced routine
of practice. Rounds were cut short,
as was the time given to punching the
bag and rope skipping.

Nothing is being left undone in
preparation for the ﬁrst match of the
season, for the Syracuse punchers are
reputed to have a team this year that
can compare with any of the cham-
pionship teams that have been
turned out at Syracuse in the past few
years, and in the last couple of sea-
sons Orange ring teams have been
mighty hard to beat.

W'ith three veterans of two seasons
and other experienced men on the
squad besides a wealth of material
just up from the fresh team Coach
Simmons has whipped together an-
other strong team.

Since the first freshman matches
will not take place for several weeks
Yet, any aspiring freshman has an op-
portunity to capture one of the weight
positions, advises Scliricker.

The two ﬁrst places won by Denny
in the 220 and 100-yard free style
1-aces gives him a perfect record,
for the night before in the F&M
meet he also won two first places.

VVilliam Ruhe came near breaking
the Delaware pool record in winning
the 50-yard free style race, covering
the distance in :25.2 which is only
two—tenths of a second away from the
record

George Myers, feeling much more at
ease after having made his debut as
a. varsity diver at F&M the night be-
fore, defeated the veteran Delaware
diver, Wilson, to take first place.

The Pitt relay team of Joe Jones,
Paul Stinner, William Ruhe, and Rus-
sell Lindberg had things in hand after
the second leg had been completed. By
the time the last leg was completed
the Pitt team was ahead by more than
a length of the 25-yard pool.

Coach Corr’s team is handicapped

of events. Heretofore the relay was
chalked up as eight points for the win-
ner. The rule governing the scoring
new states that the winning team will
receive ﬁve points. Inasmuch as -Corr
can muster a four-man team that can
come in ahead of any other team in
the league, the Panthers are rather
hard hit by the new ruling.

At the last two practice sessions
Corr put the swimmers through a
tough drill in preparation for the two
meets coming up this week-end. On
Friday night some of the swimmers
will compete in  Senior AMA meet
at the Metropolitan Club pool, and on
Saturday night the team will meet the
Tech Tartans. '

Five Pitt swimmers have been en-
tered in the two AMA events. Denny
and Lindberg are scheduled to swiiii
in the 22-0»-yard free style race and Joe
Jones, William Swazuk, and John Stir-
anka are entered in the backstroke
event.

ll/iatmen To Give
Free Show Today

Exhibition To Begin At 4 O’O1ock
In Stadium Dressing Room

The Pitt wrestling squad will give
an exhibition of the principles of col-
legiate wrestling today at 4 o'clock in
the stadium. Due to facilities, only
male students may attend the free
show.

The purpose of the exhibit accord-
ing to Earl Oster, wrestling coach, is
to acquaint every man in the Univer-
sity with the sport as it really is and
to nullify the rumors of “brutal sport”
as some students have branded it.

The program will include a short
and instriictive talk on wrestling in
general, several matches between
members of the squad in the various
weight-classes, demonstrations of legal
:-ind illegal holds in collegiate wrest-
ling. The ﬁnishing touch will be
added by a “Killer match” between
“Wildman” 1/Villets and any chal-
lenger on the squad. There will be
no admission charge.

Oster is calling for more men inter-
ested in the sport especially in the
125 and 175 pound class. Any man
wishing to try out for the varsity or
freshman teams is invited to attend
today’s exhibit. '

In Second Round

Pitt clashed with ex-Pitt on Mon-;
day evening at the Pittsburgh Golf}
club when Bob Madden met Billy}
O’Lai-ighlin in the second round of the
annual indoor tennis tournament with

feating the former net captain, 6-1,
4-6, 4-2.

Bob previously had advanced to the
second round through the default of
Carlton Hughes who sprained his
ankle while playing in a doubles match
on Sunday.

Madden and Broida featured the
action in thedoubles play Sunday aft-
ernoon byiscoring straight set vic-

tories over two opponents. In the
iirst encounter, the Pitt sophomore
and Broida, former Harvard player,
beat Moorliead and Murray 6-1, 6-4,
and came back later on in the after-
noon to down Coolidge and Vvright,
6-0, 6-2.

By virtue of their victories, Madden
and Broida advanced to the quarter-
ﬁnal round in doubles play.

According to an article published in
last F‘riday’s New York Times, Mad-
den was given ninth place in the Na-
tional Junior rankings for the 1934
season. Locally Bob holds the No. 5

post in the men’s division and rates
first among the juniors.

Cats Suffer First Cage
Defeat At Hands Of Owls

After six long years of trying, a
revengeful and aroused Temple bas-
ketball ﬁve turned upon its old jinx,
the Golden Panthers, last Saturday
night. in Philadelphia to chalk up
Ten1ple’s ﬁrst cage victory since the
two schools
hardwood back in 1929.
the revenge was a decisive
whipping.

In addition to Temple breaking the
Panther spell over them, the victory
was sweetened by the fact that the
Owls continued their undefeated rec-
ord and that with the victory Temple
shoved the Panther team out of ﬁrst
place in the Eastern Intercollegiate
Conference, the Owls themselves as-
suming the lead for the present.
