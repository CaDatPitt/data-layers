O’Connor proposes 6 percent tuition bi/ee

By John Temple
Asst News Editor

Locked intheir annual struggle to wring
funds from the Commonwealth, Pitt
administrators are awaiting a decision on

this year’s budget request.

The request includes tuition and state
aid hikes much higher than the governor
proposed in his budget statement last

month.

In an effort to suppress tuition rates that
are rising far faster than the inflation rate,
Gov. Robert Casey proposed that tuition
hikes be kept below the inﬂation rate or

almost no increases in state money be

igiven.

But Chancellor J. Dennis O’Connor is
proposing that Pitt be allowed to impose
a tuition hike of 6 percent, approximately
twice as much as the inflation rate, and
also be allocated 6 percent more from the
state than last year.

Pitt’s tuition hikes over the last five
years average about 5 percent per year, as
opposed to this year’s proposed 6 percent
increase. O’Connor justified the ongoing
increases, saying Pitt’s rates are increas-
ing slower than those of some other col-

With the end of the semester

the agenda for the Student
Government Board.

A report _
from Public Student
Safety Chair Government

Eberhardt stat-
ed that the

campus shuttle

routes will soon be expanded
to areas of Shadyside and
Squirrel Hill.

Absences of both board
members and government
Chairpersons over the past few
months was a concern for SGB

President Jacob Brody.
Weekly SGB meetings have
not been consistently attended
by all board members.

Brody said that giving a
report to a fellow board mem-
ber to read at the weekly

meetings is not
enough.

“People run
for office, they
are going to

  take on the
responsibility,”
Brody said. “We have to

Male CMU
student
raped near
Pitt campus

By John Temple
Asst News Editor

Approaching a man he
thought was injured, a male
Carnegie Mellon student was
dragged into the Flagstaff Hill
woods Sunday night and
forcibly raped by the man
and a male accomplice.

According to CMU Sergeant
William Ricci, the student
came out of Porter Hall at
10:50 p.m. and saw the man
lying across Frew Street
which borders the hill and
the CMU campus.

The student approached the
man, who was holding his leg
as if injured, and asked if he
needed help. The man then
jumped up, grabbed the stu-
dent, and with the help of
another man who had been
hiding, dragged him into the

park.
"The men, who were
unarmed, then forcibly

sodomized the student.

“We have the case under
heavy investigation,” said
Ricci, who added that the vic-
tim was unable to give
descriptions of the men.

According to Ricci, CMU
and city police beefed up
patrols in the park since the
January rape of a CMU female
student. In that rape, three
men forced the student into
the woods and raped her by
knifepoint.

Flagstaff Hill is located
about 100 yards away from
Pitt’s Frick Fine Arts building.

Students can comment on
profs to SGB committee

By Christine Hanna
News Editor

Are you having trouble with a professor? Do you have

‘a professor who you really like?

Students now have the opportunity to complain or
praise professors through Student Government Boards
Academic Committee’s professor complaint/compliment
forms.

Committee Chairperson Lynn Sucevic said that if one or
two complaints about a professor of a small class is
received, or many complaints in a larger class, then one
of the committee members will be a liaison between the
student and professor to get the problem solved. No
names will be mentioned.

If contacting the professor is not successful, Sucevic
said, the liaison will then go to the department chair.

“[This process is to] act in place of the student so the
student doesn’t have to worry about [later problems] with
the professor,” she said.

Greele Wee/e moves aheaa’ with Chariot Race

By Matt Groff
Staff Writer

With running, swimming, racing, basket-
ball and volleyball on tap in the remaining
days of Greek Week, the schedule looks
as if the Greeks are starting their own
summer games instead of raising money
for the Pennsylvania Special Olympics.

Greek Week, the annual week of frater-
nity/ sorority competition and fund raising,
continues today on a traditional note. The

“We’d like people to stick around and
watch what we are doing. Hopefully we

can get the interest to carry over and bring I

the public into other Greek Week events,”
Donofe said.

Wednesday night the public is invited
to watch the Greek God and Goddess
contest. This individual talent/toga com-
petition will be held in the Soldiers and
Sailors Memorial Auditorium and will
include an appearance by Miss
Pennsylvania.

CORRECTION

The Pitt News encourages its
readers to notify the paper of any
errors in stories or photographic
descriptions. Please use the
address and/or phone numbers
below or stop by the office from 9
a.m. to 5 p.m. each weekday.

Up to 21 people from each fraternity
and sorority will be representing their
respective chapters with a skit or song
presentation.

“This is definitely the highlight of the
week,” Donofe said. “Many chapters have
prepared two to five months for this night
— people take it very seriously.”

This show usually fills up the Soldiers
and Sailors auditorium, according to
Donofe, so the public is advised to pick

Pitt Greeks will hold their version
of the ancient Greek pastime of
chariot racing on Bigelow
Boulevard at 11 a.m.

“The chariots are basically made
out of wood, with wheels from
bicycles or wheelchairs,” overall co-
chairperson of Greek Week Steve

 

Pitt Union ticket office.

“It is a very prestigious honor for
the chapters who win first place,”
Boyd said. “Most houses put a lot
of effort into it.”

It will also take a lot of effort to
take first place in Saturday’s event,

Donofe said. “But we encourage people to
be creative in their chariot construction.”

The race, which is the fourth in a series
of Greek Week activities, is designed to
encourage teamwork and cooperation
between Greeks. For each chariot, three
people from separate fraternities and
sororities are matched together to com-
pete as a unit.

“Two guys will be pushing a girl for one
leg of the race and then they will switch
and two girls will a push a guy,” Donofe
said.

According to overall co-chairperson of
Greek Week Heather McCarthy, the chari-
ot race is an event primarily for fun and to
get people interested in Greek Week.

“It’s a good time because you get to see
people’s talents that you may not have
known about,” McCarthy said. “A lot of
people sing or play an instrument and get
real creative.”

According to events co-chairperson J.T.
Boyd, each competitor must have a spon-
sor who donates $125 to the Greek Week
fund. The sponsor is represented on their
toga.

“The acts are very professional, but the
crowd is excited and rooting for their
favorites,” Boyd said.

Friday night’s Greek Sing will also show
off the talents of various chapters.
However, this time the emphasis ‘will be
on teams instead of individuals.

Imagine for a moment that you are in a class using a book that
contains at least 87 errors.

This is what engineering students face when they take Math 0250 C
Linear Algebra and Differential Equations, a course taught by Dr. Three ' ' ' ‘ 0
Charles Cullen. Cullen also wrote the text book for the course, Linear tlme Eas tem Dlvlslon Ions
Algebra and Differential Equ.atr'ons— Second Edition. Come back far n10re

“The responsibility [for] the errors is mine,” Cullen said.

Cullen stated that most of the errors are relatively minor, such as
having an italicized zero printed instead of a normal zero. These
errors will be corrected for the second printing of the textbook, on
which Cullen is currently working.

But 87 errors?

“Proofreading is difficult,” said Cullen, who has written three math
textbooks to date, “especially for the author, because there is a great
temptation to read what you wrote instead of what is printed.”

“It’s just very difficult to discipline yourself to read stuff that care-
fully.”

Proofreading was difficult for Cullen’s wife, too. Cullen once tried

However, Cullen doesn’t think that the list, attached to every stu-
dent’s syllabus, is long. He said he even offers bonus points for stu-
dents who discover more errors in the textbook.

One student, who did not want to be identified, said the fact there
are so many errors is an annoyance. The sophomore engineering
student said that he is constantly ﬂipping papers around while doing

the homework. ~ Seats at Level 2 - Club Box

“I know of no mathematical book that I ever taught from or stud-

ied from that did not contain some errors,” Cullen said. .= Bus 1ea"reS frOm    

The textbook for the class, commonly called Calc. 25, is also used  ' ' T -r - - * ,-
at Community College of Allegheny County, which had two profes- ( partlclpants niust take provlded transportatlon)

sors contributing to the book, and the University of Minnesota. It was TlCk€tS OI]  HOW    
used at John Hopkins University last year. \ _‘ , , 7

Cullen began writing this textbook about 30 years ago, when Pitt’s (“’h’f3C}‘~Or money Order 
School of Engineering wanted to incorporate the linear algebra   for more  
course and the differential equations course into one. ‘

“It tumed out at the time that there wasn’t a suitable textbook,” he
said. He then began to develop a set of class notes, which he later
compiled and made it into a textbook.

When Cullen began teaching Calc. 25, he had to write a section
each day. The students would get the class notes, but Cullen remem-
bers that there would be days he would be teaching the class as a
teaching assistant would be running the notes off a ditto machine at
the same time.

Cullen is currently working on his fourth textbook, which is about
numerical analysis.

“It’s such detailed work to make it as accurate as possible,” he said.

Zoffer to work with undergrads

By Rebecca Baker
Staff Writer

Katz Graduate Business School Dean I-1.].
Zoffer never intended to have an administra-
tive career.

“I like administrating, but I love teaching,”
he said. “I look forward to going back to
teaching when I finish my administrative
goals.”

Along with creating a major new curricu-
lum in the graduate business school to raise
its rank, one of Zoffer’s goals is to install an
undergraduate business school at the
University of Pittsburgh.

but it doesn’t give undergrads a degree,” he
said. “[T he dual major program] lacks credi-
bility. We need to respond to legitimate aca-
demic needs with those in the common-
wealth.”

Zoffer said that the new business school
would be a unit of the graduate business
school and that he would become its dean.

“It will be funded by donations from cor-
porations, student tuition and alumni,” he
said. However, the undergraduate school is
not a whimsical project for the business
department or the university.

“There’s a definite customer demand for
it,” he said. “We haven’t gotten any more

than our fair share.”

SGB

Continued from page 1
Members of Pitt’s administra-
tion will be on hand to
address student concerns.

A Town Meeting will bring
students and SGB together on
April 6.

After last night’s meeting
board members talked about
their own projects.

Tony Moody encouraged
students to donate out—of-print
books during finals week.

Moody explained that stu-
dents can bring all textbooks
that are no longer worth any-
thing on trade-ins to the
“Bridge of Knowledge,” which
will be set up on the walkway
between Forbes Quad and the
Towers. '

“You can’t get any money
for the books, and some [stu-
dents] just throw them away
or put them in a box,” Moody
said. “Students in other coun-
tries will have the opportunity
to use these books.”

An AIDS seminar for stu-
dents is scheduled for April 7,
and Tara Munkatchy has been
involved in the plans.

“It’s for students who have
questions,” she said. “It’s
mainly to raise awareness.”

Free condoms will be
passed out at the seminar.

Munkatchy said she also
wants a scholarship booklet
she has been working on
ready for printing over the
summer. The booklet, which
will inform Pitt students on
the type of financial aid avail-

able to them, should be ready
for incoming students in the
fall.

Member Brian Bolton said
he is hoping to involve Pitt
students in tutoring programs
at local elementary schools.
He is also planning a racism
workshop.

Along with board members
Moody and August Imholtz,
Joe Foner has been investigat-
ing the use of cubicle office
space by student organiza-
tions throughout the year.

The trio had originally
planned on the possibility of
creating additional cubicles.
After checking back records,
Foner said they discovered
that out of the 44 cubicles on
the fifth floor of the William
Pitt Union, 14 of them had not
been used throughout the
entire school year.

“We can’t really kick them
out but there will be a black
mark on their record when it
comes time for renewing their
lease,” he said.

Computerized opinion sur-
veys are also in the works,
according to Foner. He has
tentative plans on a survey
where students could com-
ment on campus issues
through the computer labs.

Brody said that the end of
the school year does not mean
the end of work.

“We’re winding down to the
end of the semester,” he said,
“but I’m here all summer, still
doing stuff for the students.”

It‘ sGreek Week

In comparison to most universities the size of Pitt, the percentage
of students in fraternities or sororities is small —— around 10 percent.
But just because they are small in number does not mean they can’t
make a difference.

Greek Week is an annual event in which the Greek Week board
decides upon the charity which it wishes to represent. This week,
the Pitt Greeks will be participating in a number of athletic events
trying to raise money for the Special Olympics.

Most non-Greeks don’t understand what it means to be a mem-
ber of a Greek organization. Clichés like “I don’t have to buy my
friends” or “you lose all sense of independence” are frequently stat-
ed by those who don’t belong to a fraternity or sorority.

But those statements are hardly fair. Sure there are some ques-
tions concerning Greek life, but what institution is not blemished?
To be a member of a Greek organization also means being a part of
your community and learning how to help those who cannot help

themselves.

There is a lot at stake for the various fraternal organizations tak-
ing part in this worthy event. The winner will take home a trophy
and the distinction of having been named Greek Week champions.
Those who don’t take first place will wait anxiously until the next
year, when they will get their shot once again.

In this event, however, there are no losers. And both Greeks and
non-Greeks should show their support for this event. Community
activism and friendly competition are what will make a difference
in this world. The Pitt Greeks are doing all they can and we salute
them.

Please go away

Republicans could find something to be happy about — at least it
wasn’t Ross Perot. Well, things have changed and the little man
with the big ears is in the news once again. We wish he would just
slmt up.

Perot is trying to reassert himself on the political stage. Sunday
night, NBC broadcasted a Perot address that he called the first
“national referendum on government reform." In it he talked of
Congress's inability to lead and the presidencys failure to respond
to the wishes of the American public.

In this day and age when messiahs are popping up left and right
throughout the nation. Perot, like his counterpart David Koresh,
envisions a bright future for his followers. Also like Koresh, he is a
big nutball. Spewing rhetoric about how much he cares about
America, and about his millions of “volunteers,” Perot has attempt-
ed to remain in the public eye. His methods, however, are gim-
micks; and the American people should not be fooled.

His post-card size questionnaire in TV guide is ridiculous.
“Should America eliminate foreign lobbyists completely — no
loopholes — and make it a criminal offense,” reads question num-
ber 10. Question six asks if the government wants to raise taxes,
should it lead by example and cut spending?

While increased participation by the American people is a good
thing, it will take more than a questionnaire to solve the ills facing
this country. Ross Perot’s re-emergence is nothing more than a self-
righteous whine fest. If he really wished to help America he would
provide the country with the details that he says Congress is unwill-
ing to supply.

He had an important message for the American people that no
doubt would have been neglected had Perot not entered the presi-
dential race. But time has shown us that he was the wrong man to
carry it, and he has turned the American electoral process into a cir-
cus. It’s time to listen to the bearded lady sing, Ross, and close up
the tent.

Korea's deadly nuclear‘ ni

scenario of a nuclear

holocaust seemed a fright-
ening possibility. During the
decades we termed The Cold
War, the United States and
the Soviet Union hurtled
toward each other in a race
that seemed bound to end in
the utter destruction of
mankind. But now The Cold
War is over, and the night-
mare of a nuclear holocaust
has come to an end.

Or has it?

On March 12, North Korea
became the first ,nation to
renege on the Nuclear
Nonproliferation Treaty. In
so doing, North Korea has
not only added to suspicion
that it has or will soon have
a nuclear device but has
added concern over other
countries reneging on the
agreement. This could
severely damage the security
of East Asia and the world
and cause the nuclear night-
mare to return stronger than
ever.

It has long been suspected
that North Korea was devel-
oping a nuclear device. The
country only signed the
treaty in 1985 and still
refused to allow inspections
until May 1992. Chemical
evidence obtained in these
inspections shows that North
Korea has been producing
material for a bomb since at
least 1989. It is widely
believed that Korea is very
close to achieving its goal;
and former Secretary of State
Eagleburger has said he
believes such a weapon has
already been built. This,

Just a few years ago, the

combined with reports that
North Korea is close to fin-
ishing a missile that could
strike as far away as Japan,
is unnerving to say the least.

With North Korea in pos-
session of nuclear weapons,
the entire security of East
Asia is at risk. Northern
aggression toward our South
Korean ally could embroil
the United States into a sec-
ond Korean War. In addi-
tion, the security threat
which japan feels from the
situation may cause it to
build its own nuclear
weapons. Though China has
been on the side of the
United States in pushing
North Korea to give up its
quest for the bomb, the
Chinese would hardly feel

Mike
Brittingham
happy with two more
nuclear powers and. a
stronger U.S. presence in the
region. Tensions could rise,
bringing a deterioration of
U.S.—China relations and a
new arms race in Asia.

In addition, if North Korea
is successful in pulling out
of the treaty, other nations
may follow suit. Iraq and
Iran would be more than
happy to throw off the
chains the treaty imposes.
Such deterioration of the
treaty could result in wide-
spread development of
nuclear weapons, making
the nuclear scare of The

Cold War seem like a minor
glitch in the otherwise

ghtmare

friendly relations of the
world’s superpowers.

What can be done to halt
such a disastrous conse-
quence? Very little, actually.
History has shown again and
again that no nation is oblig-
ated to follow the guidelines
of a treaty. If it were. the
past few centuries would
have been peaceful. The
weakness lies not in the
treaties but in the system
itself. “As long as the world
remains anarchical and
nations remain sovereign.
there will be little that can
be done to enforce such
treaties without force.

What can be done and
what must be done are for
the United States and its
allies to join with China in
order to force North Korea,
through force or diplomacy,
to follow the guidelines of
the treaty. If the most pow-
erful nations of the world
are united in the common
cause of keeping nuclear
weapons from spreading, the
nuclear wannabes of the
world may be compelled to
give up their dangerous
quests. Success is far from
certain, but only a strong,
united effort could possibly
manage to keep the nuclear
genie in its bottle. If the
genie gets loose, the peace
and security of the world
will surely be shattered and
our happy days in the sun
will be over. And our night-
mare will have just begun.

Murphy led a group of three
strong performers, as the Pitt
men’s track team concluded
its season at the Eastern
Championships (IC4As) at
Harvard University.

Murphy concluded his suc-
cessful first year by sprinting
to a third-place finish, with a
time of 7.46 seconds, in the
55—meter hurdles. Murphy
was coming off the high of
being crowned Big East
Champion in the 55—meter
hurdles two weeks earlier.

Senior Brian Whitley ran
his last collegiate race in the
200 meter and came away

Murphyhurdles to third in IC4As

with an eighth-place finish
with a time of 21.91.

“In a very competitive field,
he did a great job,” Pitt head
coach John Vasvary said.

Whitley improved on his
time of 22.36, which was
good enough for a fourth-
place finish at the Big East
Championships.

Suffering from injuries
throughout his career, junior
pentathlete Tim Flanders
reinjured his Achilles tendon
during the high jump compe-
tition and couldn’t even run
in the 1,000 meter, which
Vasvary said is one of his bet-
ter events. ,

“He was definitely in a
position to score. He had a
fifth or sixth [place] locked

up and could have finished
even higher, but that’s the
nature of the sport,” Vasvary
said.

Flanders finished third in
the Pentathlon at the Big East
Championships.

The Pentathlon also con-
sists of the shot put, 55—meter
hurdles and long jump.

Georgetown won the meet,
rising to the top of a field of
84 colleges and over 1,400
athletes in the biggest indoor
IC4A meet ever.

The outdoor track season
will begin next weekend for
the Panthers —— who will not
take the entire team to the
meet — when they travel to
the Alabama Relays at the
University of Alabama.

Now at full strength, the Penguins are charging back to the top spot in the NHL.

With Mario Lemieux close
to the top of his game, the
Penguins have won six in a
row to regain their number-
one standing in the NHL.

The Penguins have already
set team records for most
wins and points in a season;
and with a win tonight,
they’ll be two short of the
coveted 100-point plateau.

But beware, regular season
success doesn’t always trans-
late into postseason glory.
The Rangers led the NHL in
points last season and were
toppled by the Pens in the
second round of the playoffs
last year. Chicago was
embarrassed the year before
by Minnesota in the first
round of. the playoffs.

A main reason these teams
faltered is overconfidence.
The Blackhawks were a
superior team to Minnesota,
but they underachieved
when it counted. Last year,
the Rangers were cocky in

thinking they would have an
easy time beating Pittsburgh
(minus Lemieux).

The two-time champion
Penguins must not get over-
confident. They can’t go into
the playoffs with the “we’re
the champions and you’re
not” mentality, thinking that
other teams will fear them
just because they’re the
champs.

Some teams also coast
once they run up a high

Clark

point total, and they never
regain their regular season
form in the playoffs. At the
moment, it doesn’t seem as if
the Penguins will have to
worry about this.

-The Penguins reinstated
defenseman Bryan Fogarty

last week and assigned him
to their top minor league
team in Cleveland. Fogarty
had been in alcohol rehabili-
tation.

Not to sound coldhearted,
but Fogarty will never recov-
er from his drinking prob-
lems. This wasn’t his first
bout with drinking problems.
During his career in Quebec,
he spent time in alcohol
rehabilitation. Even the
death of ex-teammate and
roommate John Kordic, who
abused just about every-
thing, wasn’t enough to keep
Fogarty from drinking.

At least Fogarty has admit-
ted (time and again) to his
problem and he has shown
the desire to get help. But if
that treatment hasn’t helped
by now it never will, which
is a shame for the talented
ex—number-one pick of the
Nordiques.

case against racism

By Mike Johns
Staff Writer

In today’s society, there
are a lot of stereotypes con-
cerning African-American
athletes.

Jimmy “the Greek”
Snyder, a well-known for-
mer sports analyst said that
African Americans were
bred during slavery to be
outstanding athletes.

Al Campanis, the former
general manager of the L.A.
Dodgers, said during a live
interview on “Nightline”
with newscaster Ted

’ Koppel, “African Americans

ics and racism in and out of

‘athletics. He also speaks out

on how he deals with
racism, and the number—one
things African—American ath-
letes should get out of col-
lege. He also explains how
African Americans have to
be a lot better than their
white counterparts when it
comes to receiving highly

coveted positions like com-

pany president or NFL quar-
terback.

Pitt News: Were you pre-
pared for life after profes-
sional athletics?

Dwayne Woodruff:
Definitely. When I was
drafted in ‘79 by the Steelers

ety as a Whole. There is no ques-
tion there is racism in profes-

in sports, and besides, they
already dominate most of
professional sports anyway.
If they were in the front
offices there would be noth-
ing for the whites to do in
professional sports.”

Recently, Marge Schott,
owner of the Cincinnati
Reds, reportedly stated, “I
would rather have a trained
monkey than a nigger work-
ing for me.”

Also, Schott stated that
she made some of these
jokes while in the presence
of other owners, and they
also made similar com-
ments. Major League
Baseball’s hiring practices of
minorities is shameful. How
can African Americans who
play for Schott and other
owners who feel like she
does feel that they can be
treated fairly?

There are many profes-
sional athletes who truly
destroy any negative mis-
conceptions about African-
American athletes.

One such athlete is
Dwayne Woodruff, who
played for 11 years with the
Pittsburgh Steelers. In 1989,
his final full season, he was
the only active Steeler to
have played on a Super
Bowl Championship team.
Woodruff played in 141
games and started 104. He
retired in 1990 and is now a
successful attorney/sports
agent with the law firm
Meyer, Darragh in
Pittsburgh.

In an interview for The
Pitt News, Woodruff tells his
thoughts on such issues as
life after professional athlet-

that was the day that I start-
ed plann_ing to retire.
Having the responsibility of
having a family, I thought it
was necessary to start
preparing myself for life
after football, because pro
football doesn’t last that
long. I was fortunate to play
the many years that I did,
but going to law school [at
Duquesne University] and
getting my degree while I
was still playing prepared
me for my profession out-
side of professional football.
PN: Does racism occur in
sports more so now than in
the past?

DW: Racism is prevalent in
society, and sports is a
reflection of society as a
whole. There is no question
that there is racism in pro-
fessional sports. Just as there
is no question that racism
exists in our society in busi-
ness ‘as a whole. It is always
something that if you’re
non-white that you’re going
to have to deal with.

" Those that survive and
continue on deal with it,
and you have to face the
fact that it is there. There are
those that don’t think racism
is there, that America has
come so far that there is no
more racism. There is still
racism, but I don’t think it is
more now than in the past. I
think we'are on the right
track, but were just moving
down that track very slowly.

effects "of racism in your
professional career?

way. There are always obsta-
cles that you must face all
along. It just depends on how
ready you are to overcome that
obstacle. I was fortunate
enough to be raised by a moth-
er and father that informed me
that there would be obstacles
that I would have to face
because of my color —— not
only in sports but in anything
in life that I wanted to do.
Racism never had a negative
effect on me or on what I
wanted to accomplish in life.
PN: As an ex—professional ath-
lete and now as an attorney,
what did you feel about the
remarks that Marge Schott
allegedly made?

DW: There isn’t any place for
comments like that. I saw an
interview with her and she said
that she made some of those
comments off the cuff and jok-
ingly. I don’t think that is a jok-
ing matter. That is something
that does not have a place in

Thoughts like that are what
breeds the violence, the dis-
content and the problems.

PN: As an African American
who played professional ath-
letics, were you shielded from
racism that other African
Americans who don’t have
celebrity status receive?

DW: 1 don’t think I had to go
through a lot of the harsh reali-
ties of life because I did play
professional sports.
Professional athletes, especial-
ly African-American profes-
sional athletes live in a world
somewhat shielded from harsh
realities.

You can walk into a store
and be treated with some type
of respect. You can go places
and the doors will be opened
for you as it should be. Where
a lot of those times those doors
would be closed. It is impor-
tant for the African-American
athlete to realize why all those
doors are being opened for
him.

Why are you being treated
the way that you are, and how
long that is going to last? Are
those same doors going to be
opened for you when you can’t
play anymore or if you hap-
pened to get injured and your
career ends? It is important to
realize what types of people
you are dealing with and how
and why you obtained some of
the success you obtained up

. until that point.

PN: What would be the num-
ber one thing that an African-
American student athlete
should get out of college?

DW: The number one thing
that a student athlete should
get out of college is an educa-
tion. We talk about the oppres-
sion and all the obstacles that
are going to be in front of
African-American athletes that
you need an education
because one day professional
athletics will be over. The one
thing that I found, to keep you
in a position that you demand
respect and that doors contin-
ue to still be open to you, is an
education.

They can take everything
else away from you. They can
take away your opportunity to
play athletics, but one thing
that they cannot take from you

is an education. If you’ re
going to go to college you
want to definitely come out
educated. This holds truer if
you have an opportunity to go
school on a scholarship where
there is a free education for
you.

PN: You had a very good rela-
tionship with the media. It
seems that if an African-
American athlete is controver-
sial the media is very conde-
scending toward him no matter
how great of a player he is.
DW: Yes, it is definitely true.
There are some in the media
that I like andthere are some
that I don’t like. It is important,
especially for A frican-
American athletes, that they’re
not only role models in a way
[whether that be right or
wrong] but they also have an
opportunity to spread a posi-

 

tive message and to be able to
[tell others] that you not only
have to have an education but
you have to be able to know
the right things to say and to
work with the media. The
media can spread your mes-
sage like a forest fire. They can
also spread the negative things.

If you watch the news
tonight, there are going to be
stories about murderers and
robbers and criminals, and
there are going to be pictures
of them. And — guaranteed —
the majority of the pictures are
going to be of African-
American individuals. There is
something wrong with that.
The majority of crime in
America doesn’t involve
African-American individuals,
yet if you were foreign to this
country and watched television
in America for the first time
you would think that all crime

There is a reason for every-

African-American athletes to
realize what they’re saying,
why they’re saying it and what
kind of effect it is going to
have. The way society is today
it’s very important to say what
you really mean and be able to
back it up.

PN: Is it just a coincidence that
in the NFL if you are an
African-American quarterback
you are either a superstar
[Warren Moon, Randall
Cunningham] or you’re not the
starter?

SUMMER 1993

Pens

Rangers in the playoffs,
expect numerous run-ins
with Lemieux and the newly
acquired Esa Tikkanen.
Tikkanen is one of the most
annoying players in the NHL
and the former Selke finalist
(for best defensive forward)
will no doubt shadow
Lemieux.

Lemieux has won these
contests before, but being
shadowed and harassed for a
round can take a lot out of
player. This would be a true
test of how close Lemieux is
to 100 percent.

-Lemieux has moved back
into second place in the NHL
scoring race with a torrid
week of scoring. In the last
three games, Lemieux has
scored nine goals while set-
ting up three others.
Heading into last night’s
game, Lemieux was under 10
points behind Pat LaFontaine
of Buffalo. If Lemieux can
win the scoring title (which
won’t be as easy as some of
the media is saying), there

should be no doubt that he
should be MVP.

Even if he finishes second
in the scoring race, Lemieux

still should win the Hart
Trophy.

-Why won’t it be as easy
as some sports announcers
say it will be for Lemieux to
win the scoring title?

. LaFontaine passed up

Lemieux because Lemieux
couldn’t play. Thus, he

wasn’t putting points on the

board. Now, Lemieux must
pass up somebody who is
playing.

If Lemieux scores three
points in a game and
LaFontaine scores two,
Lemieux has made up only
one point.

If it were December or
January, Lemieux would be
able to blow past
LaFontaine, but there’s only
a few weeksleft in the sea-
son. Still, if you like a race,
this will be a good one.

coincidence. You can take a
number of a things in life, not
only being a African-
American quarterback. There
are all kinds of professions 
if you’re African American, to
achieve that type of status
you have to be that much
better than your white coun-
terpart. That is something
blacks need to realize.

You have African
Americans as presidents of
companies and professional
quarterbacks. It is getting bet-
ter. African Americans as
quarterbacks come in and
can do so many things on the
field. They are so fast and do
great things.

A lot of coaches say “great
athlete” and want to put him
in another position because
he is talented in those areas
too and they have someone
else to throw the football. But
even that image is being torn
down with Moon and

Cunningham and Vince
Evans. Colleges are using
black quarterbacks [Florida
State's Charlie Ward], and
eventually you will see these
players in the pro ranks as
quarterbacks. It is just anoth-
er thing to overcome.

PN: Art Shell got the head
coaching job with the Raiders
largely because he was one
of the greatest Raiders ever.
Maybe if he wasn’t he
wouldn’t have gotten the
opportunity just coming up
through the coaching ranks.
Last year, did Joe Green get a
legitimate shot of becoming
the head coach of the
Pittsburgh Steelers?

DW: I’m not quite sure if he
was a real candidate or not. I
know the Rooneys quite
well; I don’t think there was
any reason to interview Joe if
they didn’t think he could do
the job. We had a lot of black
candidates here [Pittsburgh]
that deserve to have the

opportunity to become a NFL
head coach.

Joe Green [was] on that list,
even though he lacked some
experience, but so did Shell,
and he is doing a great job
with the Raiders. Tony
Dungy [defensive coordina-
tor, Minnesota Vikings] was
here and I thought he was
ready to be a head coach in
the NFL. Those are just two
African-American candidates
that were on this team that I
played with. So I am sure that
there are many others out
there that would be great NFL
head coaches.

Knowing Joe and the
Rooneys, I believe he got an
interview because he
deserved it and not to inter-
view Joe would be a travesty
for the Pittsburgh Steelers.
The fact that he didn’t get
hired wasn’t racism. They
went out and hired a great
replacement for Chuck Noll
in Bill Cowher.
