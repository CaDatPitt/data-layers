The Black Action Society has started a
campaign to discourage black students
from enrolling at Pitt.

“Because of academic, political, social,
cultural and faculty deficiencies at the
University of Pittsburgh, we cannot
recommend this institution for black people
any longer,” said a letter signed by over
200 black students.

Justin Laing, chairperson of the BAS
political-action committee, said Pitt is not
a comfortable place for black students.
The letter, which originated in the political—
action committee and was supported by
the steering committee, encourages black

Peace protesters get

students to attend all-black schools instead.

“We feel that as the representative of I

black people at this institution, we need to
warn those who would come here about
our situation and not let them be fooled by
the university’s wide propaganda
program,” Laing said.

The letter will be sent to various high
schools, and members of the BAS will
speak at high schools about the statement.
The BAS has also contacted various media
sources.

The BAS said the following conditions
contributed to the release of the statement:

-Academic problems, evidenced
because seven of every 10 black students
that enter Pitt will not graduate with a
degree.

-A cultural and social environment that

0A “dangerously low” level of black
faculty. Three percent of the faculty is
African—American.

oThe university “refusing to
acknowledge their mistake” in not allowing
the BAS to put a student on the presidential—
search committee.

“These conditions have existed for a
very long time, but when we organized for
the presidential-search committee and we
went and we marched about that, the
university would refuse to respond,” Laing
said. “Putting someone on that committee

would have been an important but
superficial move. Changing things like
faculty, retention, the lack of cultural
activities for African—American people is
harder. If you can’t change something on
the presidential—search committee, we
would be foolish to believe that we can
change some of these other issues that are
much more fundamental.” "

Laing said student support for the
statement has been overwhelmingly
positive.

“So far it has been above 95-percent
positive. Students read it, they understand
it and they say ‘Yeah, I wouldn’t come
back here either, and I wouldn’t want
anyone else to come back here,”’ Laing

reduced sentences

By Eric Hoch
Staﬂ“ Writer

Comparatively light sentences
were given to 31 people arrested
last month during three acts of
civil disobedience. The sentences
were pronounced in traffic court
on the South Side.

A compromise worked out
between District Attorney Sandra
Hoppter, Mike Healey and other
defense lawyers lowered the
charges from misdemeanor
offenses to summary offenses.
The people, some of them Pitt
students, were sentenced to
perform 16 hours of service work
at the Rainbow Kitchen and to
pay the $48.50 court costs. After
these sentences have been carried
out, the charges will be expunged
from the students’ police records.

“I encourage you to do this,”
saidjudge Moria Harrington. “You
don’t want your record to remain
with the police. It could hurt you
in the future. It can come back to
haunt you later.”

CGS student government

V Kitchen

Healey said that similar cases
in which civil disobedience was
involved prevented the
defendants from getting into too
much trouble.

“In defending a case where
civil disobedience is involved, an
old historic, unwritten defense is
used called the ‘justification
defense.’ Its legal status is unclear,
but it considers whether a crime
is done in order to prevent a
greater wrong. Today was a
compromise for everybody, and
this way, the people can get this
off their record," Healey said.

Hoppter was unavailable for
comment due to city—court duties.

Bob Anderson of the Rainbow
said mandatory
community service has been done
at the kitchen in the past. _

“A lot of these people volunteer
more after their required hours,”
he said.

Pitt student William Pettit, who
was sentenced yesterday, said
that the group expected such a
sentence and accepted it.

supports faculty union

Pitt faculty should unionize,
according to a statement released
by the College of General Studies
Student Government Council last
Thursday.

The text reads: “The CGS
Student Government endorses the
unionization of faculty members
at the University of Pittsburgh. It
is believed that collective
bargaining between faculty and
administration would promote
teamwork among and between
these two bodies, thus enhancing
the overall quality of education
and the reputation of the
university.

“In regards to equitable
treatment of faculty, the CGS
Student Government believes

unionization would decrease
partiality in decision-making
within the university."

Kevin Novak, judicial-affairs
director said, “CGS Student
Council is a little older than the
typical student, and they have all
dealt with unions with their own
employment. So they have a little
more basis for [determining] what
benefits can be reaped from
unionization and what negatives
can result."

According to the statement, the
letter is the consensus only of the
government council, and CGS
students were not surveyed for
their opinions.

Activiszpredicts repeal
of last apartheid laws

By Milt Klopfer
Senior Suﬁ‘ Writer

  
 

 
 

Apartheid is nearly at an end, said Donald Woods, a journalist
and anti-apartheid activist.

“Now we can realistically contemplate the repeal of the last
three apartheid laws out of an original 317,” said Woods.
“Apartheid is not at an end, but it is in its terminal stages. We
can at last see the end of the road."

Woods spoke last night in the William Pitt Union. He
predicted that a new democratic constitution for South Africa
would be likely by the end of the year. “What an exciting time
to be witnessing,” he said. “The human race is working itself
forward all the time.”

Recent trends towards democratic reform in Eastern Europe
and China, according to Woods, were all part of an unstoppable
urge for freedom, which is taking place even now in South

“Most of the people within South Africa have brought about
the developments today fully as much as those on the outside,”

’/lxiom’ wins
College Bowl,-
All-stars go

to regionals

By Andrea Guilfoy
Slajf Writer

Although it was the winning
team in last night's College Bowl,
Axiom of Choice will not be
going to the regional tournament.

Instead, a team made up of two
graduates and two
undergraduates will represent Pitt
on an all—star team.

Joe Cavalla, director of student
activities, said that Pitt usually
sends the winning team to
regionals, but this year it had to
consider another alternative. Two
of the teams in the semifinals
consisted of all graduate students,
and the other two teams were all
undergraduates.

According to Cavalla, the
regional tournament only allows
the winning team to have two
graduates. The other two
members‘ have to be
undergraduates.

After considering various
options before the game the teams
agreed to combine the best
graduates and undergraduates to
make an all—star team.

“I'm glad we’re going with an
all-star team because any time
you go to the regionals, you’re
always playing against an all-star
team, and the competition gets
really tough," said Michael Young,
captain of Axiom of Choice. “It
will make for a much stronger
team."

Young was chosen as one of
the graduate students for the all-
star team. This is his fourth time
playing in the re gionals. The other
graduate on the team is Keith
Parsons from the history and

' philosophy of science
department.

undergraduates on the team, said

Complaints about dorms, blotter btgbligbtfomm

By Andrea Barczykowski
sum Writer

Resident assistants and other
students were - given the
opportunity to raise questions
ranging from housing and food
to the university policy of de nying
access to police reports at the
annual Open Forum sponsored
by the Resident Student
Association.

One subject of discussion was
the new university policy which
prohibits campus police reports
from being made available to the
public.

According to Walt Waters,
assistant director of public safety,

the" university is not legally.

required to adhere to the Freedom
of Information Act or the
Pennsylvania Right to Know Act.

“That information doesn’t have
to be given out,” Waters said.

He said the city will not accept
the reports for any serious crimes
on campus. 8

He said, “If a student is arrested

rape [or], I’d hate to say, homicide,
the city police won’t accept our
records.”

Waters said the reports are held
because of moral responsibilities
to students.

“We are not letting anyone have
the names of the individuals -
the victims. If a person takes too
many sleeping pills and gets taken
to the hospital, it is not necessary
for people to know that,” he said.

Another matter discussed was
the new policy which ' bans
smoking in all university
buildings. According to resident
assistants, many students who
reside in the dormitories are upset
with this new policy.

“I'm a smoker. What we’re
looking at is a philosophy that
very few people can argue against.
It just doesn’t make sense. We’re
not saying you can’t smoke. You
just can’t smoke in our buildings,”
said William Harmon, vice
president of student affairs.

Creating a smoking ﬂoor for
people who live in the dorms

According to Jo Ann Woodson,
director of the Office of Residence
Life, “A smoking ﬂoor would not
be in line with the policy.”

Problems in the residence halls
were discussed, especially the
increased burglaries in the dorms
during school breaks. Some
students said that recent thefts
have occurred in which secured
doors were unlocked and then
re-locked by the thief.

According to Waters, this
indicates that the thefts are an
inside job.

“I really can’t say too much.
This is the first time in about four
or ﬁve years that incidents similar

[to this] have occurred,” Waters ,

said.

He said special precautions will
be taken over spring break
because of the robberies during
the winter break.

“We will add patrols to the
dormitories. Hopefully, with the
resident assistants and myself we
can keep itunder control, " Waters
said.

the insufficient cleaning of the
bathroom on weekends. “ O n
the weekends we have a limited
staff. The trash is our main priority.
One person cleaning the
bathroom is not feasible. We try
to do the greatest good for the
greatest number of people. We
have people available for
emergency situations,” said Bill
Robinson, associate director of
housing and food services.
Some said that not all
emergency requests were taken
care of immediately.
Robinson said, “A breakdown in

communication probably
occurred.”
Robinson offered an

explanation for the heating
problems in the dorms.

“We try to walk a fine line
when we turn the heat on or off.
Sometimes we hit it, and
sometimes we don’t,” he said.

Harmon also discussed the
limited space in the dorms.

“A proposal has been developed
to construct residence halls at the

Kuwaiti student says internal problems plague country

By Renee Crespy
Stajf Writer

Racism and corrupt leadership
endanger Kuwait more than the
war in the Persian Gulf, a former
resident of Kuwait said Monday
at a Pittsburgh Students for Peace
meeting. -

Ravish Momin, now a freshman
at Carnegie Mellon, lived in
Kuwait City but moved to the
United States when his father got
a job there and was granted a
work permit to live in the United
States.

Momin said the image some
people have of Kuwait as a rich

top of the hill. We want to get to
a point where we can provide
on-campus housing for all
students who want on-campus
housing,” Harmon said. ‘i

Harmon is also concerned with
the attractiveness of any new
buildings.

“I will not support anything
that goes higher than seven ﬂoors.
It must be an attractive building.
It must be competitive with other
buildings,” he said.

Mary Cacali, associate director
of housing and food services,
said a committee was developed
to improve the food served in the
university cafeterias.

“We work very closely with the
Student Advisory Committee.
They’re supposed to bring your
complaints to us,” she said.

Telefact’s funding for the next
three years was also discussed.

“lTelefactl gives you something
by which to make a comparison.
What we’re doing is establishing
what might be a library. I don’t
think that’s a waste of funds,”
Harmon said.

Harmon said T elefact has been
successful.

“We had a question on if
Lithuania imports its condoms or
makes them themselves. We had

the answer right there,” he said. .

nation is inaccurate. Most Kuwaitis
are lower to middle class and
aren’t powerful enough to
overcome the rich, he said.

“The rich population consists
of only a very small ratio, but they
can manipulate others,” said
Momin. “The rniddle—class people
in Kuwait are not happy with the
way they are treated.

“We would have actually been
happier with [Iraqi President]
Saddam Hussein. All this talk
about President Bush freeing
Kuwait is nonsense because we
were never free,” said Momin. “I
don’t approve lofl George Bush's
foreign policy or what he is doing

at all.”

Momin declined to comment
on his feelings about Saddam for
fear of people’s reactions.

Momin said racism and other
problems in Kuwait that aren’t
related to the war need more
attention.

“There is a lot of racism in
Kuwait. The rich people want to
be like Europeans or Americans,
and racism runs high. My mother
was from Saudi Arabia, and my
dad was from Iran, so I was
discriminated against. I don’t want
to go back there because of all
the racism,” said Momin.

“If you are an Arab or from any

other ethnic group and you speak
out against your leader, they will
kill you. We don’t have any fancy
equipment like electric chairs,
but they will just hang you or
shoot you on the spot,” said
Momin.

“Stuff like cutting people’s
hands off if you steal really does
happen there —— it is not
something you just read about.”

Momin doesn’t want to stay in
America because he feels that
Americans are apathetic and
unfeeling.

“I don’t want to stay in America
because people are very apathetic
here. They just don’t care what

happens,” said Momin.

Since the war has broken out,
Momin hasn't been able to get in
touch with friends or relatives in
Kuwait.

“I have family and friends over’

there, but. we haven’t heard

anything —— nothing at all. It’s A

terrifying,” said Momin.

Momin said if he were in Kuwait 

during the invasion, his family
would have left the country befo
the war started. ~

“I probably wouldn’t have been
there. My dad would have saw
the trouble building up and got
us out of there,” said Momin.

Woods

Continued from page 1
he said.

Woods is the subject of the
1987 motion picture Cry
Freedom. Exiled from his native
South Africa for,13 years, Woods
recently returned and was
impressed by the strength of the
South African blacks after years
of oppression.

“In the [black] townships, in
spite of the suffering, poverty
and the air practically crackling
with anger, these people are the
most upbeat people in the whole
world,” he said. Despite such
signs of hope, Woods said he
believes South Africa still has a
long way to go before it becomes
truly free and equal for all.

“You cannot say to people who

have not had their civil rights for
350 years, ‘Oh boy! Next Tuesday,
we’re all equal,”’ he said.

Woods said that economic
sanctions against South Africa
should be continued until the
oppressed, the blacks led by
Nelson Mandela, say they should
be lifted. '

“You’ve got a lot of white
people running around saying
that South Africa has done well
and must be rewarded by lifting
sanctions,” he said. “Only when
the blacks tell [the world] that
they should be lifted should they
be lifted.”

Woods spoke about the days

“absurd and horrible” time of

apartheid law concerning
bathrooms. According to this law,
for every 15 workers of the four
racial groups, blacks, whites,
Asians and mulattos, a separate
toilet must be built in the
workplace.

“Racists, for some strange
reason, are obsessed with
plumbing arrangements,” he said.

With two sexes, this
theoretically makes it necessary
to have eight differentbathrooms.

“You would end up with this
tiny little factory with this
conglomeration of toilets,” he
said.

“His sense of humor and
compassion were obvious to
every person in listening range,”
said Karl Parker, a sophomore

biology major. “He is dedicated
soundly in body and spirit.”

“I think it was great,” said South
African Flora Mosaka-Wright, a
graduate student in the School of
Education. “I was very impressed;
his humor was great. I think he
was very genuine about
conditions in South Africa.”

Steven Sutherland, an exiled
South African professor in the
English department, was less
enthusiastic.

“I don’t really like Donald
Woods, but I do respect him,”
Sutherland said. “He paints a more
rosy picture than I would paint.”

Woods was presented with an
honorary membership in Pitt’s
Student Publication Board, which
sponsored the event.

said. Students have been
signing the statement for a
week and a half, and Laing
said he hopes to get 350
signatures.

“We hope to reach as many
people as possible,” Laing said.

While student support may
be great, one Pitt administrator
disagrees with the BAS

" SlZ3.[€lTlCl’1[.

Associate Provostjack Daniel
said that he agrees with the
points in the letter that refer to
faculty, academics and cultural
and social problems, but he
does not support the point
about the presidential-search
committee.

“There, I don't find myself in
complete agreement with
them. I do not believe that the
presence of one African—Amer-
ican student on that search
committee would have made a
significant difference. For me,
it would be much more
important forAfn’can-American
students to interview all
presidential candidates when
they come to campus,” he said.

Daniel said he “has to
disagree” with the idea of
discouraging black students to
come to Pitt.

-“African-American people
cannot refuse to participate in
any major social institution. As
I said many times, there is a lot
wrong with our criminal justice
system, but because there is a
lot wrong, we cannot refuse to
be lawyers and judges. There
is a lot wrong with our
economic system, but because
there is a lot wrong with our
economic system, we cannot
refuse to;-become entre-
preneurs. if-here is a lot of
racism andisexism in the mass
media, but because there is a
lot of racism and sexism in the
mass media, we cannot refuse
to own mass media. There is a
lot wrong with the University
of Pittsburgh when it comes to

A African-Americans in general.

But we cannot refuse to
participate,” Daniel said.
Daniel said he is not being
critical of BAS; he just has a
different view. “I will
encourage African American
students to come here. This is
a great university. It has
tremendous resources. I want

“ 

Segregation is when somebody takes you
and says, ‘sit over here. ’ Separation is
when you look around and you say, ‘I am
not doing very well here, so I am going to
go over here and do something on my

own. ’

—Justin Laing

 ”

African—American stu-dents to
come here and benefit from
those resources,” Daniel said.

“African-American tax dollars
go into this university. African-
American blood, sweat and
tears have gone into this
university. There are too many
African—Americans who have
worked too hard to get as far
as we have [gotten] today. So
we have too much equity‘ in
the University of Pittsburgh.
We cannot refuse to participate.
The resource is too great to
throw it away,” he said.

Laing said the BAS’s
argument is two-sided. “Argu-
ment one is the power of black
schools regardless of the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh, and the
University of Pittsburgh makes
this even worse,” he said.

“We really want to turn
people on to the black college.
It is ‘simple economics. If you
take your money and put it out
of your community and into
somebody else’s, their commu-
nity gets richer and stronger,
and your community gets
poorer. So if you put it in black
colleges, you help to strengthen
yourselﬁ” Laing said.

Laing said that blacks do
better at all-black schools.

“At black schools, we
graduate at twice the rate we
do at white schools. Black
students report that as far as
social environment, they find
it twice as good as they do at
white schools. They are more
liable to be proud of the school
they go to and enjoy
themselves,” Laing said.

The letter said there is “severe
campus segregation” at Pitt.

“Everyone knows where the
black people and the white
people are,” said Laing. “Black
people are” in certain sections
of the lobby, certain sections
of the [cafeteria]; they go certain

places on weekends, and so
do white people. They have
their certain places, too. The
whole school is segregated.

“Those whites who say, ‘I
have a lot of black friends, or I
have some black friends’ —-
most of those black friends, if
you ask them, ‘But do your
black friends have black
friends?’ They say, ‘No.’ So what
do they have there? People
who aren’t accepted in the black
community itself,” said Laing.

Laing said the black schools
promote separation, not
segregation.

“Segregation is when
somebody takes you and says,
‘Sit over here.’ Separation is
when you look around and
you say, ‘I am not doing very
well here, so I am going to go
over here and do something of
my own,”’ Laing said. “I think
Stokely Carmichael once said,
‘We are not trying to destroy
your house; we are just trying
to build our own.’

“Our real goal is not
integration, anyway. Integra-

tion is this general idea that we a

all are one — we all are the
same people. It has not even
come close to being worked,
and I haven't met an
integrationist yet who has a
program for putting all the black
masses into white America.
There just isn’t enough room.
When‘you integrate anyway,
you end up losing your culture
and everything else,” he said.

Laing added that if the
University of Pittsburgh is the
only place a black student can
afford to go, it would be better
to attend Pitt than to not get a
college education.

“We. feel that it is extremely
necessary for black people to
enroll in institutions, but we
would rather them go to black
schools,” he said.

The following is the text of theletter
released by the Black Action Society

Black students, we would like to make one thing perfectly clear: In today's
society college, for better or worse, is necessary, and by no means should
one forego it if given the chance. If for various reasons a student has one

option then without question one must take this option. That said, we will now ‘

move into our discussion of the University of Pittsburgh and how we feel it is
ntl failin black people. _

prgsuee ft’) the gfollowing academic, political, social, cultural and faculty

deficiencies at the University of Pittsburgh, we cannot recommend this

institution for black people any longer. _ _

1. Academically — For a variety of reasons, black people are not thriving
at the University of Pittsburgh scholastically. This can be evidenced by the
abominable graduation and retention rate. For every .10 black people that
enter this institution of higher learning, almost seven will not graduate with a
degree from the University of Pittsburgh. _ _ _

2. Culturally & Socially — The social and cultural environment at IS so
lacking that we do not feel as though it comes anywhere near providing the
type of nurturing environment that will allow the majority of our community to
succeed. ° , _ ,

3. Faculty — The number of black faculty at the university is dangerously
low. Only three percent of the faculty is black, and unless one is a. black-
studies major, the chance ofdevelopingthe type of mentor-student relationship
that is very instrumental to success when one sees oneself as a minority is
very small. I 7 _

4. Politically —— In November 1990, the black student populationbegan an
intensive campaign to place more students on the presidential—search
committee. We were especially interested in a student that could directly
represent our interests. This committee was so heavily laden with trustees,
faculty, etc., and only one student as to throw into serious question the idea
that the student is a prominent concern of the school. However, after various
forms of protest including a march that drew over 200 people the university
refused to acknowledge their mistake.

Herein lies the political deficiency. When black people organized and
expressed quite clearly their desire for the very reasonable cause of helping
to choose their future president, they were without hesitation rejected. ,
Because of this we do not believe that we would be reasonable to think we
have the political powerto changethe morefundamental problems mentioned
earlier.

Another problem is the severe campus segregation. Despite the fact that
the Black Action Society clearly went out [of] its way to show that the issue
affected everyone, and despite widespread claims from the white community
that the decision was unfair, there were less than five whites at the march to
protest the present makeup of the presidential-search committee. We believe
that in the present climate this is indicative of the prevalent attitude in the
white community, which is this: If we believe it's a black thing, then we refuse
tolunderstand. *

It is because of these academic, political, social, cultural and faculty
deficiencies at the University of Pittsburgh that we cannot recommend this
institution for black people any longer.

We believe that black schools should be seriously investigated. Jacqueline
Fleming, author of Blacks in College, has shown quite clearly in her very
thorough study, Blacks in College, that blacks do twice as well in_ every
measure that was applied — whether it be academic, social or cultural. it is
important to note that not only do blacks graduate at a rate twice that of white

" schools but that they do just as well when applying for grad schools and jobs

when they graduate. We also believe that going to blackschools directly
relates to the Persian Gulf war, and we will explain that next.

Once again, as we know, there are exceedingly high numbers of blacks in
the military force deployed in the war in the Persian Gulf. We believe this has
nothing to do with allegiance to the Red, White and Blue and everything to do
with lack of Green in our community. Because of the lack of gainful
employment for black people, the military absorbs too many of our young
brothers and sisters. The reason this is, is because we do not support nor
create institutions to take care of our own (93 percent of our $300 billion Gross
National Product goes outside our community), so our people go to others for

‘ help, and because we cannot employ them, they will die disproportionately,

again. -

However, if we would begin to support institutions like the black schools,
not only would our students achieve higher in academic, social and cultural
measures, but the black school could produce more graduates, who in turn
could produce more jobs‘, which in turn could literally save lives. This would
allow us to save our people so they could ‘help save our community instead
of the government using our people to save them money.

Wrestlers drop final dual match of season to Mountaineers

By Bob Maselli * 3
Sta_[)" Writer

It was a tough end to a dismal season; the
Panther wrestling squad lost its ﬁnal dual match
of the season 32-9 to Eastern Wrestling League
opponent West Virginia University.

The “Senior Night” excitement halted quickly
as the 12th—ranked Mountaineers took to the mat
and didn’t give the Panthers a victory until the
sixth match. .

“I think we got out-fought,” said Panther Coach
Rande Stottlemyer. “This team is the best [West
Virginia] team we’ve ever met.”

The Panthers had a scary moment in the 134-
pound weight class when freshman Mike Michalec

was flipped over by WVU’s Matt Blair. Michalec,

landed on his head and snapped his neck,
sending gasps and shrieks throughout Fitzgerald
Field House. The match was stopped, and the
trainers attended to Michalec for about five
minutes. Pitt was forced to forfeit the match.

“It’s one of those things where you’re not sure
what to do,” said Stottlemyer. “We had to be
careful with it.”

The Mountaineers are ranked high in the nation
partly because three of theirwrestlers are nationally
ranked. 1

Scott Collins (142 pounds) is ranked No. 1 in the
country. Mark Banks (167) is ranked No. 4.
Dominic Black (190) is ranked No. 3. All won
their matches, 7-3, 10-2, and 23-8, respectively.

' The only bright spots on the night for Pitt were

Scott Hovan (158) and Perry Miller (heavyweight).

Hovan, 24-2 on the season, dominated his
opponent from the get-go. Hovan’s aggressive
style earned him a pin with eight seconds
remaining in the second period. Hovan attacked
his opponent like a hungry dog attacks his dinner.
WVU’s Dave Onorato, no sloucher with a 24-8
record, played the part of Alpo and had nowhere
to run.

In the heavyweight matchup, Miller (17-6-1)
met up with Charles Davis (15-10) in an exciting
duel. Miller immediately took control of the
match in the first period, leading 4-0. But soon
after that, Davis took the upper hand and made
the score 4-3. The next two. periods would prove
important for Miller, as he controlled Davis and

ended up with the win, 8-3.

Both Hovan and Miller, who have wrestled well
all season for the Panthers, figure to be highly
ranked in the Eastern Wrestling League
Championships at Penn State on Friday and
Saturday, March 1 and 2.

“Scotty and Perry again wrestled well and have
shown that they're the best. Scotty is the best in

the nation," Stottlemyer said. ~

He reﬂected on the tough dual-meet season but
is looking towards the future. ,

“We’re almost done,” said Stottlemyer. “I think
the guys realize that we're at the end of the line.
It didn’t seem like a long season until Saturday,
but when we lost to Clarion, it hit us. What we’ve
wanted to do all along is get our men to the EWLS

and NCAAs..”

Staff Writer

Every team has that one person that it V

can count on to come through when the
pressure is on. The Lakers have Magic
Johnson; the Kings have Wayne Gretzky;
the Red Sox have Wade Boggs, and the
Pitt wrestling team has Scott Hovan.
Over the course of this season, Hovan
has compiled a 24-2 record, including a
victory last ‘night over West Virginia’s
Dave Onorato. More importantly to the
team, Hovan is 12-1 within the Eastern
Wrestling League. _
In last night’s match, Hovan exploded

on Onorato, who came intothe match _

with a 24-7' record, and eventually pined
his opponent in the second period.

is a tough kid. I was pretty motivated
recently. I’ve really been focusing on the
national championship.”

Panther wrestling Coach Rande
Stottlemyer explained his junior
sensation’s gift. “Scott came out there
with the eye of the tiger tonight. He
didn’t let up for a second.”

Besides being an exceptional wrestler,
Hovan is also extremely active when he
is not on the mat. He can often be seen
shouting encouragement and suggestions
to his teammates while they are wrestling

and is not afraid to tell them how to gain
an advantage or achieve points.

“I don’t do it to be a leader. I do it to
help the guys out. I want everyone to be
as successful as I am because that will
make the team better.”

Hovan, who is ranked fifth in the
nation, has slowly become a better
wrestler over the course of the season.
After missing two matches because he
failed to make weight, he has returned
with a new sense of team spirit and
leadership. '

He said, “I’m in better shape now, and ._

my mental attitude has been better.”
Stottlemyer has also seen the change
in his star wrestler. “He’s as good as

anyone out there. He’s only got three
matches to win in the Eastern Wrestling
League tournament and five in the NCAA
tournament, and he can win it all.”

West Virginia Coach Craig Turnball
was also impressed with the Panther
junior. “I’ve never seen him look better.
He came out firing and reallyimpressed
us. He’s definitely a national contender.”

As for Hovan, the goal is simple. “I
want to be the national champion. That’s
what I’ve been working for the whole
season,” he said. _,

Fortunately for Hovan, the waiting is
almost over. He’ll get his chance in the
EWL Championships on March 1 and 2
at Penn State.

Injuries plague Big East Conference

By Derek Willis
Sta_[fWriter

College basketball has been hit
hard by injuries this year, and the
Big East is no exception. Just
think how this season might have
been if these players had been
healthy for the entire year: Alonzo
Mourning of Georgetown; Bobby
Martin, Brian Shorter and Darelle
Porter of Pitt; Billy Singleton of
St. John’s; and even Steve Pikiell
of Connecticut.

Pikiell has been hurt for about
five years now, but if he’s healthy,
he could provide UConn with a
capable, if unspectacular, point
guard.

Don’t underestimate the effect
Singleton’s injury had on St.
John’s. Sure, it allowed the
Redmen to find minutes for
promising freshman Shawnelle
Scott, but Scott isn’t nearly the
post defender or hard worker
that a healthy Singleton is. One

ANALYSIS

sure sign of injury is foul trouble,
and Singleton has been limited
by fouls since hurting his knee
last month.

The losses at Pitt have been
substantial, although the Panthers’
depth has helped to fill the gap.
Even though Porter has started
all but one game and seen a lot of
action, he has been hampered on
defense and less explosive on
offense. The days of Porter
dunking over Mourning are over,
at least for now.

There is a reason why Porter
has become a more prolific (and
consistent) three-point shooter:
His quickness has been reduced,

which is affecting his penetration
skills. He has been forced to
become a perimeter threat.
Mouming’s six—week layoff hurt
Georgetown then, and it is still
hurting them. The Hoyas, as a
team, are about a month behind
in terms of offensive development
and consistency. In order to
develop an offense, you need the
players which are to be primary
options to be healthy.
Georgetown will still play great
defense becauseJohn Thompson
demands man-to-man skills of all
his players and also the simple
presence of two shot—blockers.
Offensively, however, the Hoyas
will struggle, especially when the
guards aren’t shooting well.
And now Syracuse freshman
Adrian Autry is sidelined with a
broken toe. Although the injury
is not serious, the effect on the
Orangemen could be. Autry is

Pens hammer Sabres

By Brian Berger
Staff Writer

Coach Bob Johnson has tried various methods — from satellite
dishes to unorthodox practice routines —— in the past few weeks
to improve the Penguins’ performance, but one thing he need not
tamper with is the team’s home effort.

Last night at the Civic Arena, the Pens dropped the Buffalo
Sabres 6-3 in dramatic fashion as a plethora of Pens shined infront
of the sold-out arena crowd.

Mario Lemieux continued to reclaim hockey’s throne by setting
up Mark Recchi’s 31st goal of the season. Lemieux picked
defensemen Greg Brown’s pocket behind the Buffalo goal,
swooped in on goaltender Darren Puppa, shot, got his own
rebound and spotted Recchi all alone. The Pens led 1-0 after a
sluggish first period. I

The second period was devastating for the Sabres; their defense
was caught out of position time and again, and the Pens were able

‘ to cash in four times, leading 5-1 after two.

The Pens chipped in their second goal with the Sabres a man
down by utilizing their power-play talent beautifully. Mario threw
the puck high at the blue line to Paul Coffey, who returned the
favor.

Then Lemieux took two strides towards Puppa and fed Kevin
Stevens, who banked home his 28th goal off the right post in what
might have been one of the prettiest goals the team has scored all

Salary cap needed to curb escalig contracts

Imagine the Washington
Pirates, the Miami Pirates, the
Jacksonville Pirates or maybe
even the Tampa Bay Bucs instead
of the good old Pittsburgh Pirates.

This could happen very soon.
Baseball salaries are escalating
out of control, and the Bucs don’t
have the bucks to keep up.

The team has already begun to
lose talent to free agency this
year with the departures of first
baseman Sid Bream and inﬁelder
Wally Backman.

R. J. Reynolds doesn’t count
because he went to Japan, and
Rafael Belliard doesn’t count
because he is, well  Rafael
Belliard. J

Then again, the Braves will pay

J him $450,000 this year —— more

than I’ll ever make in 10 years (or
the rest of my life), so I doubt he
cares if I think he doesn’t count.

Bobby Bonilla and Barry Bonds
both lost in arbitration. Bonilla
will only make $2.4 million this
year (poor baby), and Bonds will
have to settle for a measly $2.3
million. (That must hurt. How
will he ever survive?)

The point is, if they continue to
play as they did last year, the
Pirates won’t be able to afford to
keep them when they become
free agents.

Remember, the Bucs lost $7
njlillion in a year of record
,,_,,_;af7§tendance. This was because they
 to pay $11 million in collusion
‘damages.

That is real fair. This team never
signs high-priced free agents
when collusion isn’t going on.
Without the collusion damages,
the profits still wouldn't be
enough to pay just Bonds and

Bonilla alone for the ’91 season. I

The Pirates will continue to
lose talent until they get to the
point where they are no longer
competitive. As the Bucs’ losing
years in the mid-1980s proved,
Pittsburgh will not support a

Three Rivers Stadium may exist minus the Pirates in the future if the Bucs can't keep up with escalating salaries.

losing baseball team. Actually,
Pittsburgh won’t support a
winning one either, as evidenced
by the empty seats in Three
Rivers Stadium during last year’s
playoffs and even the regular
season.

The owners, crying about a
lack of support, will proceed to
dispatch what is left of the team’s
talent in a “rebuilding effort.”
The results of this can be seen by
looking at the sad state of the
Houston Astros. A team in this
condition will become available
for sale, and the new owners will
almost definitely move the team.

The search for a solution to
Pittsburgh’s problem leads to a
bigger problem for major league
baseball. The ridiculous spiraling
of baseball salaries must be
stopped. Soon after the 1989

season ended, Kirby Puckett
became the first player to get a
contract paying $3~ million per
season. Now, barely over a year
later, 35 major leaguers make at
least that much.

Roger Clemens and Jose
Canseco have contracts that will
pay them over $5 million in the
near future. Canseco’s contract
led teammate Rickey Henderson,
the second $3 million man after
Puckett, to complain that he is
worth more than three-fifths of
Canseco. He is, but both salaries
are too high. ,

The higher salaries get, the less
competitive baseball will become
because the richest teams buy up

all the talent. Besides, who wants
to see all these mediocre
millionaires?

The players are not totally to
blame. Who can blame a guy for
getting as much as he can? Who
would actually turn that money
down? They are the ones who
will suffer if something is done to
change things.

A salary cap is the only solution,
no matter how much the players
will scream, cry, etc. There must
be a limit so that teams of lesser
financial resources such as
Pittsburgh, Seattle and Houston
can afford to pay their players.
Some allowances will have to be
made for teams that already have
huge payrolls, but things can’t be
allowed to go further.

Mark McGuire’s new contract
brings the Oakland A’s team
payroll, the highest in the major
leagues, to $35 million, so set that
as the limit. Keep it there until

team payrolls start to even. out,
and then raise it gradually as the
NBA does with its cap.

Fay Vincent will have to be the
initiator. His biggest mistake as
commissioner has been letting
things get this far. Something
should have been done long ago,
but Bart Giamatti didn’t have
enough time in office to establish
himself and do it, and Peter
Ueberroth seemed more
concerned about his image than
doing anything for the good of
baseball.

Vincent has done a great job as
commissioner, and he may be in
a strong enough position to get a
salary cap established.

A salary cap will only slow the
growth of salaries, but it is the
best solution .available. Even
though the NBA has one, Clyde
Drexler will be making $8 million
for one year when his current
contract runs out.

This is very distressing to a fan
of the old “Six Million Dollar
Man” television show. Does that
contract mean that Drexler is
better than Lee Majors? Any team
that pays these extravagant
salaries under a cap will just
restrict its ability to pay its other
players

Salaries also won’t grow as
fast in baseball because there are
so many more players on a
baseball team than a basketball
team.

‘Seasoned’ goalie anchors hockey club

Byjohn Labriola
Staﬂ" Writer

Most of the members of Pitt’s hockey club speak
of Mark D’Amico, one of the Panthers’ goaltenders,
as the old man on the team.

D’Amico, 33, has been tending Pitt’s goal for the
past three years and doesn’t mind being the oldest
member of Pitt’s team. “I like [playing for Pitt], and
just playing at all is fun,” said D’Amico. “Playing
with people younger than me means that I don’t
have to get old right away.” .

D’Amico and the Pitt hockey club traveled to
Bowling Green, Ohio, last weekend to compete
against one of their most challenging adversaries:
the Bowling Green Falcons.

Although the Panthers skated away from the
two-day competition with two losses under their
belts (13—7 on Friday and 8-5 on Saturday), they
made a strong showing against a competitor with
better skills than Pitt.

“I was really proud of the way we played,” said
D’Amico. “We’re feeling pretty good right now. We

are happy with the way we played, and we think

9 that it was really a good experience for us.

“A lot of the younger guys on the team now know
that there are a lot of people out there that play
hockey a lot better than we do. We know that. In
order to play with people like that, we’ve got to
play together.”

' D’Amico said that the Falcons should have
“blasted” the Panthers harder than they did, but the
scores did not show how well the Panthers played.
“We stayed with them, and everybody played well
together, which is something that we hadn't been
doing lately, and I think that’s something that’s
going to make us a whole lot better as a team.”

Throughout his time with Pitt, D’Amico has seen
many changes in the team. He had been with the
team for one year in 1980 when he was an

undergraduate. He returned to the team in 1988 I

when he began working towards a doctorate in
biology. One of the major changes in the team was
the addition of Mark Uknis to the Panthers’ coaching
staff.

For the Pitt News

The Pitt women’s swim team faces its biggest
challenge of the season as it travels to Princeton, N.J.,
for the NCAA Eastern Regional Championships.

After consecutive weeks of stiff competition —- first
in the Big East championships and then last weekend
in the Pennsylvania Open-— the Lady Panthers should
be well-prepared for the type of swimming that is
expected this year at the championships.

To make it to Easterns, the swimmers had to equal

‘Women's swimming gears 1/Lpf0rEastern Regionals

meet. If a swimmer qualified for any one event, she could
swim in another event by equaling last year’s 36th-place
finish. Until this year, a swimmer only had to qualify in
one event to have the option of participating in any
event.

“There will be a lot less confusion now at Easterns,”
said assistant coach Chris Chorornankis.

“The events should run a lot more smoothly. I know
our swimmers are really looking forward to this
championship, and this is what the whole season is
geared for. The team should do pretty well on the overall
score,” said Choromarkis.

and divers, Pitt will be well represented with 13
swimmers and two divers. By event, the Lady Panther
swimmers are listed below.

Backstroke: Janine Atiyeh, Jennifer Burns.
Breaststroke: Candie Burke, KarinMasa1, Suzi McManus,
Laura—Lee Sullivan.

Butterﬂy: Noelle Berry, Kara Moxie, Julie Rocks.

season.

Pittsburgh’s other three goals were the result

T of hard, diligent work by the forwards. Phil

Borque scored a shorthanded goal -— a rarity for
the Pens. Bob Errey threw a wicked body check
into Brown, then planted his body in front of the
net and whacked a Gordie Roberts flip shot in
to the net. JaromirJagr netted his 20th goal of the
seasonas he poked a Recchi pass by Puppa,
who was nowhere near the play.

Bryan Trottier scored not only his sixth goal
of the season, but also the Pens sixth and final
goal midway through the third period to preserve
the Penguin victory. Tom Barrasso played well
between the pipes, turning away 35 Buffalo
shots en route to his 18th victory of the campaign.

The Penguins host Toronto at the Igloo on
Thursday, then head out on a (YIKES!) ﬁve-
game, eight-day road trip on Friday that begins

_in New Jersey and ends in Calgary. The Pens

have lost five straight on the road and eight of
their last 10, as well as giving up 50 road goals
in that span.

Much of this is because of the Pens’ inefficiency
in killing penalties on the road, a tendency to get
behind early and an ability to give up two or
three goals in a very short span. This is crunch
time, and this road trip could turn the page
forward or backward; if they come home empty-
handed, they are going to find themselves at
Philly, at New Jersey and at the New York late
in‘March. These will be must—win games that will
determine whether the Pens will be able to host
a playoff game in April.

Coach Johnson made an interesting comment
last week when asked about the physical play in
the Patrick Division (for example, Philly vs.
Washington last week, in which 300 penalty
minutes were dished out). He had an idea how
to stop that rough stuff: three power—play goals.
Three to nothing, just like that.

Hockey
Continued from page 9
“Weiused to run [the defense
with] some of the players taking
some of the responsibility from
Coach Bele so he would be able
to run the offense,” said D’Amico.
“It’s kind of hard to do both at
once, and he used to do that.”
D’Amico said that with Uknis
working the defense, Bele is able
to keep a closer eye on the game.
“It’s always good to have two

people watching you rather than
one,” said D’Amico.
Goaltender is one of the
toughest positions in hockey.
D’Amico was injured several
times during his career at Pitt. “I
get hurt a lot, it seems,” said
D’Amico, jokingly. “Maybe it’s
because I'm a little bit older.
Playing with these young guys, I
guess I’m a little more fragile
now — a little less limber.”

Bowl

Continued from page 1
he is excited about the
competition and thinks it will be
a lot of fun.

“I think the fact that because
we have both grads and
undergrads, there’s a good mix,
and it will represent the
university,” said Lewis.

Al Rosenthal was the other
undergraduate that made the
team, but he may give his Spot to
one of the alternates because the
tournament conflicts with his
spring-break plans.

Rosenthal said the all—star team
is a good idea. “You want Pitt to
do well, and all those other

schools have a1l—star teams. So in »

order to have a good shot Pitt
should do the same.”

Pete McClure, director of
recreation for the Pitt Program
Council, Said the all-Star team
was chosen based on the number
of correct and incorrect answers
of each player. The numbers were
tallied, and the strongest players
were chosen. ' ,

Two alternates were Selected.
Christopher Hitchcock is the
alternate for the grads, and
Michael Petro is the alternate for
the undergrads.

“Overall the College Bowl was
very successful, and everyone
seemed to enjoy themselves. It
really went smooth,” said
McClure.

The regional tournament will
be held at Pitt this year. Teams
from throughout the region will
come to compete in the William
Pitt Union.

According to Cavalla, during
regionals there will be five

simultaneous games throughout

the union, and they will be played
in a round-robin format. The team
with the most wins will advance
to the national tournament—— the
highest level of College Bowl

play.
