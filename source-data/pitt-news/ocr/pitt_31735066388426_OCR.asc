University requires liability
insurance for clothing makers

By Lisa R. Pugliese
Staff Writer

The University of Pittsburgh is requiring
all manufacturers of Pitt clothing to obtain
$1 million worth of liability insurance.

“[$1 million] is the minimum amount [of
insurance] that is acceptable,” said Bill
Richter of Pitt's licensing department.

According to Richter, the new liability
insurance is specifically targeting the
sporting-goods industry, covering such
Pitt items as sweatshirts, T-shirts and
baseball caps.

Richter stated that the addendum comes
in response to such problems as non-
ﬂame-resistant T-shirts and poisonous dyes

which may damage the skin. He added A

that instances such as these, although

infrequent, must be- taken into
consideration by sportswear
manufacturers.

“This society is lawsuit-happy,” said
Richter. “[Pitt] is protecting itself against an
admitted extreme.

“We’re«. talking about the worst—case
scenarios," he said.

Requiring manufacturers" to‘ ‘obtain
liability insurance is intended to bring Pitt
up-to-date with many other universities,
which already require _mam,'ifacturers of
clothing with university logos to be insured.
It also is used as protection for the
university, so that Pitt may not become
liable for a problem incurred by purchasing
Pitt clothing through an outside
manufacturer.

“It is absurdlfor manufacturers] not to
have [liability insurancel," said Richter.

Richter said there are approximately
800 companies which are licensed to
print ‘Pitt products. He ‘added that

‘approximately 80 percent of those

companies already have the required
insurance. -

‘ “I am responsible’ for policing [Pitt]
products nationwide,” said Richter.

Charles Bonasorte, an'Oakland T-shirt
vendor, is claimin g that Pitt's new insurance
policy is putting many small manufacturers
out of business because they cannot afford
the yearly‘ costs. ‘ ’

Bonasorte added that a few of the
printers he deals with cannot meet the
new demands laid down by Pitt.

“I’m not saying Pitt [has handed down
the addendum] ‘because of me, but they
are trying to capitalize, and they want the
monopoly,” said Bonasorte. - 8 4

Bonasorte also claimed that larger
sporting-goods manufacturers such as
GEAR and STARTER will not sell to him
because of Pitt. — ' '

, “Their salesmen have told me that they
already have a quality customer in the
area,” said Bonasorte.

According to Richter, the new insurance
requirements involve a minimal cost to
the manufacturers. \

“[Pitt] can make the case that they are
doingsmall businesses aserviceby making
them aware of the rights allotted to them
[by insurance companiesl," said Richter.

Faculty optimistic about proposed salary increases

By Donna Terrell
Stat)‘ Writer

The promise of a 7.5-percent
increase in the salary pool has
faculty members looking forward
to the 1991-92 school year with
guarded optimism.

Last fall Pitt's administration
announced that one of the top
priorities for the fiscal year 1992
budget would be increasing the
faculty salary pool by 7.5 percent.

“Pitt has never announced its
intentions so early. This is the
first time salaries were such a
high priority," said Donald
McBurney, who co-chairs the
faculty senate budget—policies
committee. McBurney said he is
hopeful the university will keep
its promise but realizes that the
the difficulties the university is
facing with state appropriations
may affect salaries.

Faculty members are also

concerned about how the
increased salaries will compare
to the median salaries of other
American Association of
Universities professors.

“It is still too early to tell exactly
how much closer this will bring
Pitt to the AAU median,”
McBurney said. He said the
actions of other universities have
to‘ be taken into account, but he
assumed that the budget
difficulties most states are

Gay bashing increases on’ campuses

By Megan Bertino
Sta_[)"W1'iler

At 12:45 a.m., on a Tuesday last February, Jeff,
a student at Carnegie Mellon, stood in front of
his dorm on Forbes Avenue waitingfor a cab to
take him to Pegasus, a gay bar on Liberty
Avenue. -

Because it was an unseasonably warm night,
Jeff was not wearing a coat to cover up his
“queer clothes." His cut-off denim shorts, black
stockings and women's blouse made him easily
identifiable as homosexual to the gang of males
approaching him.

From a distance, Jeff heard them talking
among themselves about the “faggot” on the
corner. Jeff nervously checked his watch,
regretting he had earlier declined a ride from
friends because he wanted to study before he

went out. »

As the gang of five males approached, Jeff
nervously looked up and down the street, but no
cab was in sight. The males surroundedjeff, and
one asked why he was “wearing pantyhose."
Was he “some kind of fag?” H

Although Jeff was openly homosexual within
the gay community, he was too frightened and
intimidated to answer. The same male shoved
Jeff and yelled, “I’m talking to you, homo.”

At this point Jeff became so frightened he
began to cry. One of the males told Jeff he
wanted his shirt so he could “give” it to his
mother.” Another told Jeff to give him the shirt.
Terrified for his safety, Jeff gave him the shirt.
The same‘ male told Jeff to get his “fucking
pantyhose off.” Reluctantly, Jeff began removing
his shorts and stockings when a car approached

experiencing may help close the

Even if the gap between Pitt
and the AAU schools does not
decrease, faculty members are
considering the salary-pool
increase as a move in the right
direction, according to McBurney.

Since 1986 a joint faculty-
administrative committee has
been trying unsuccessfully to
close the gap in salaries. Between
the fiscal years 1988-89 and 1989-

90, the gap increased by $100 a
year

Some faculty members‘ think
the university should establish a
new system to allocate funds.

“Because salary increases are
based on merit,” McBurney said,
“there may be lip service from

faculty members who want cost-i ‘

of—living increases considered. We

need both.” 8

Rather than starting all over
again for the 1991-92 school term,
the new steering committee of
the Black Action Society has
decided to build on what has
already been done, according to
chairperson Marta Effinger.

“Right now we are working to
implement a lot of the things that
the 14-point plan talked about,”
Effinger said. _

Effinger, along with new deputy
chairpersonJustin Laing, said the

“It is the direction that BAS is
going,” Efﬁnger said. '

Laing said, “All the 14 points
say is that the university needs to
be reformed.”

Along with continuing to
implement the 14-point plan, BAS
plans to institute a lot of the
programs that were discussed by
last year’s administration.

The university recognizes,
respects and appreciates
professors who do outstanding
jobs in teaching and research.
However, some faculty members
think the university places too
much emphasis on research when
distributing rewards and deciding
who gets tenure or professorship.

Provost Donald Henderson said
that all decisions regarding
rewards and promotions are
based on merit. Henderson said
research, along with teaching and
service, are part of a professor’s
job and that anyone who does
not devote time to each is “out of
line with university policy.”

Chemistry professor Toby
Chapman, who co-Chairs the
Faculty Senate educational

policies committee, sees things
differently.
“There is very little, if any,

Compensationlfor extra efforts in
teaching. Teaching anything more
than the absolute minimum
required for undergraduate
education is not considered
criteria for compensation.”

He said that under the current

system “teaching becomes a sort '

of punishment — heavy work
loads for which there will be no
compensation.”

Du ring the 1989-90 school year,
the Working Group on Status
and Recognition of Teaching, a
task force made of university pro-
fessors, presented a list of recom-
mendations to the Faculty Senate
educational policies committee.

The group concluded that
“proper balance within’ the
university’s combined mission of
research and teaching never will
be achieved unless teaching

mance receive substantial weight
in the important professional
evaluations affecting the lives of

individual faculty members.”

According to the committee,
changes in the current system of
evaluation must come from top-
level administrators. The
committee report stated, “It is not
possible to legislate that the
university afford greater status
and recognition for teaching. A
comrriitrnent must come from the
academic administration led by
the president, the provost and the
vice president for the health
sciences and must be in the form
of tangible actions.” The task force
also recom—mended that an office
of teaching be set up with levels
and staff equivalent to the research
ad-ministration. Chapman said he
thinks Henderson believes more
should be done to reward
undergraduate teaching, but he
doesn’t know how it should be
done.

Development shut down.
Objections from faculty members
saved the office, which was
established to improve teaching.

Psychology professor Mark
Strauss said problems surface
because people tend to think
teaching and research oppose
each other. Strauss said he would
prefer teachers who are active in
research “because they have the
most recent data and are more
likely to be excited about
communicating the results of their
research.” He warned that
professors who are not active in

the research community exper- .

ience burn out from continuously
teaching the same information.
Strauss said the current‘

university system places greater ‘

emphasis on research than on
teaching, which puts pressure on
faculty members who know that

research and scholarly activity ’

are the greatest criteria for
promotions and other rewards. ’ I

Utilities chair discuss

By Beth Kovaly
Stajf Writer

Public Utility Commission
Chairperson William H. Smith
discussed issues ranging from
energy conservation and
pollution control to increased
telephone services last Friday at a
breakfast lecture in the William
Pitt Union.

His speech, “The Pennsylvania
PUC: Today and Tomorrow,”
focused on issues the electric-
utilities industry will be battling
in the ’90s, including the Federal
Clean Air Act’s pollution-control
standards, the role conservation
plays in the increasing demand
for electricity and the hazards of
electromagnetic ﬁelds.

Through 1990 there have been
61,468 jobs created and $840
million invested in the electric

industry, according to Smith. Also, .

$115 million has been saved in
utility bills, he said. Large users,
such as school districts, can save
money buying directly from
suppliers at a discount. Also,
according to Smith, utilities-have
successfully encouraged larger
companies to take over smaller,
troubled ones;

Smith spoke about the extended

areas of telephone services as 1

well. “We’ve expanded our Link-
Up-America program to make
the installation of telephone
services even more available to
those with limited financial
resources. There is also an
ongoing investigation on the
uncollectible balances of the
pooh"

Another phone program is the
new, complimentary 900-number
blocking service. “However,”
Smith said, “we’ve just approved
a new 900 service. It’s called Dial-
A-Prayer for atheists. You call,
and no one, answers.”

On _a serious note, Smith
discussed a system benefiting
hearing- and speech-impaired cu-
stomers for only 8 cents a month.

A program being used by
Pennsylvania utilities is called
Demand Side Management,
where both the customer and the
utility company are asked to
conserve. For the utilities,
however, there must be some
incentive provided for their lost
revenue, he said.

“This program should ensure a
full and timely recovery of direct
program costs and lost revenue,”
Smith said. “But lost revenue. is
not the main concern. It must be
cost-effective and justified in terms
of benefits. Consider the

“[Pitt’s licensing] program is

environmental benefits for future
generations.

“Utilities are expectedto rely
on DSM to ensure that future
generations’ energy supplies are
adequate. The process must be
understandable to be fully
operative. The administration has
to keep it simple and straight-
forward, “ he added.

Smith discussed the recent
regulations by the FCAA to control
pollution standards in coal plants.
The FCAA has two goal dates for
this reduction: by 1995 and 2000.
The integration of these pollution
standards, Smith said, may greatly
increase the cost of electricity in
the years ahead, unless the most
cost-efficient ways of improving
the coal plants can be put into
effect.

“Our preliminary figures
estimate a cost of nearly $2 billion
over the next 10 years. We want
to know what these costs will
mean to the rate payers and when
[they will take effect]. The PUC
will ultimately judge these
strategies. We must try to assure
that every option will be given
full consideration. This will
include rate—payers, utility-stock
holders, and affected industries
and their employees. And there’s

Moving onto environmental
issues, Smith recalled a time when
Pitt football had been tagged the
“Slumbering Giant of the East.”

“We have a new slumbering
giant," he said. “I’m talking about
the electromagnetic field.”

The National Cancerilnstitute
has failed to show conclusive
evidence of a connection between
the EMF and health hazards for
humans, he said. However, there
does seem to be a connection of

Smith said it should be a subject
of growing interest. “There is
concern about the EMF being put
out by these big power lines. And
yet, some of the studies suggest
that if electromagnetic fields are
dangerous, that may be the least
of the danger because all these

“That doesn’t excuse me as a_ 

utility regulator. I still have to
look at what’s happening with
transmission lines. All I’m saying
is, we’ve got a problem here, we

think, although the experts don't - 

all agree.”
Smith said, “Scientists are not

able to tell us what is a safe level. » 17‘-

But on the assumption that it’s
dangerous, we’ve got to do
something. One thing we can do
is make the [transmission] poles

“If students are not aware of
everything that is going on, then
that might lead them to not

" participate,” Effinger said.
_ “Hopefully, when the commun-

ication lines open up, more
students will get involved.”

BAS feels it is necessary to talk
with students to ﬁnd out if the
administration's plans and ideas
are the same as the students’.

With this goal in mind, Effinger
plans to bring the students’ and
the administration’s ideas together
in the hopes of incorporating
programs that will be of interest
to black students.

To get more black students

involved on a regular basis with
the administration's activities, BAS
is planning weekly updates and
monthly tribal meetings.
Another major plan that BAS
has for the upcoming school term
is to put black students in

‘positions of power in the

university.

According to Laing, “We have
someone -involved with Pitt
Program Council, and we are
working to get someone on the
‘Student Government Board.”

This year has taught BAS that it
is important to get in on things
from the very beginning, Laing
said.

“We have established a lot of

connections,” Laing said, “so
that before anything gets started,
we find out about it.

“For example, we are working
on the very ground—level stages
of how the next dorm isvbeing
built and the level of black
participation in that,” Laing said.

This coming term, BAS will
have a community outreach
committee, which will get the
community involved in some
BAS programs.

Effinger feels that having a
greater network with the
community will benefit the
organization tremendously.

Effinger said, “When we have
problems and need support, we

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, April 17, 1991

can look to the community for
some examples, since they have
a better understanding of the
structure of the city of Pittsburgh.”

BASICS chairperson Ricardo
Washington would like to develop
a Black Unity Council that would
bring all black organizations on
campus together.

To help improve the retention
rate of black students, BAS will
also try to implement a study

group.

All of the BAS’s plans will be
worked on over the summer so
that when the fall term begins
everything will be in place.

Effinger said she hopes that
graduating steering-committee
members, along with other black
students who are leaving the
university, will remain committed
to the African-American com-
munity.

Efﬁnger said, “Because you are
not involved with BAS anymore
or because you are not on the
steering committee anymore or
because you are no longer a
student at Pitt —_ that doesn’t
mean your work stops or that
commitment should stop. It
should be an ongoing process for
you to develop your community
as well as yourself.”

THE PIT!’ NEWS, Wednesday, April 17, 1991

Bashing

Continued from page 1
and the gang ran off, leaving
Jeff standing half-naked on
Forbes Avenue.

What happened to Jeff is not
an isolated incident. Anti—gay
sentiment and gay-bashing
incidents are on the rise
throughout the United States.
In 1990 a record—high 1,588
incidents of harassment and
violence were reported to gay
agencies in New York, San
Francisco, Los Angeles,
Chicago, Boston and St. Paul: a
42-percent increase over 1989,
according to the National Gay
and Lesbian Task Force.

Kevin Berrill of NGLTF
speculated that because of
victim apprehension about
“coming out” and fear of police
abuse, 1,588 is only “a fraction
of the episodes that occurred
in these cities last year.”

The increasing rates of anti-
gay incidents are alarming to
the gay community, according
to Berrill.

“Widespread and growing
anti-gay attacks across this

country are a form of domestic A

terrorism intended to drive us
back into the isolation and
self-hatred of the closet,” he
said.

No area of society is protected
from anti-gay sentiment, not
even the college campus, which
has traditionally been thought
of as a place of free thinking,
choice and diversity.

In 1989, 1,411 anti-gay attacks
were reported to the NGLTF
from 34 college campuses
nationwide.

Because of the high number
of incidents reported in 1989,
NGLTF conducted a survey of
gay students on the campuses,
including Pennsylvania State
University, Yale and Rutgers.
Of the students surveyed, 40 to
70 percent reported being the
victims of verbal harassment
on campus; 16 to 26 percent of
the students reported being
threatened with violence on
campus.

Three to 5 percent of the
students polled reported they
had been the targets of physical
harassment on campus.

Melissa Smith, co-president

of the Bisexual Gay and Lesbian

Alliance at Pitt, said the
increased anti-gay activity at
Pitt may be the result of the
increased visibility of BiGALA.
However, she said the increased
visibility helps to unite the gay
community.

“Unity is powerful. There is
power in numbers,” said Smith.
“I believe, in the long term,

lvisibility] will create positive

change, but right now I believe
with visibility there is going to
be a backlash with higher rates
of gay bashing than in recent
years.”

Smith also said that Pitt creates
an unfriendly environment for
gay students.

“My girlfriend and I would go
everywhere in the city holding
hands; the toughest thing for
me to do was walk through
campus holding her hand,”
Smith said.

As co-president of BiGALA,
Smith has received harassing
phone calls from anti-gay
individuals.

One caller left the following
message on the BiGALA
answering machine: The caller
first said “fags” several times,
then added, “All gays must
fucking die. Do you understand
what you people do? lt’s
immoral, disgusting and against
all laws of morality and religion.
You guys are sick; you’re
assholes. Why don’t you just
stop andfucking be normal

people?” The caller made more .

harassing comments before
hanging up.

Other campuses have been.

the targets of more serious
events. ‘

In March 1990, at the
University of Delaware, a chalk
outline of a body with raw meat
splattered at the head was found

' outside a university building.

Next to the display was written,
“Another dead faggot.”
According to NGLTF, a group
called the Homophobic
Liberation Front claimed
responsibility for the incident. ,

rejected a faculty senate resolution
calling for cost-of-living indexes
to be considered. Although last
year's salary increase came very
close to the cost-of-living increase,
the system of rewards based on
merit vs. cost-of-living increases
remains a “sore point” with faculty
members, according to
McBurney.

Provost Donald Henderson said
the decision to consider the cost-
of-living increase has not yet been

made.
Associate Provost Elizabeth
Barager said the university was
aiming for a more satisfactory
salary—distribution policy but does
not foresee a change in the
traditional policy of rewards based
solely on merit in the near future.

man suspected of raping a
university student last October.
The mock trial was held to

university theater students. The
jury was randomly selected from
the audience members, who were
mostly female.

Europe has decided to reward South Africa for moves
it hopes will end apartheid. Unfortunately, those moves
will not end this ‘type of rule; rather, they are merely
attempts to make the government look good on the
international front. A '

After months of negotiations and bickering in the South
African government, President F. W. de Klerk has moved
several laws, which will give blacks in the country more
rights, through the country's parliament. For this, the
European community has decided to lift its economic
sanctions. against South Africa.

The Bush administration, however, is not quite as
enthusiastic. Washington has officially announced that it

will not lift any sanctions against South Africa until all
political prisoners are freed and until the country ‘repeals ’

all laws which classify people by race. '
South Africa’s three main exports, gold coins, iron and
steel, will cause the prices of each of the metals -to
plummet. With more surplus on the market, many
countries will more easily be able to purchase them.

The Europeans will not be able to sell military weapons V
to South Africa, though. That will not happen until the .

United Nations, which passed a resolution to this effect,
says that South Africa has changed enough to be treated
as an official country.

Unfortunate as it is, it all boils down to one key element:
money. Europe’s economy as a whole has come to a halt
and is on the verge of a recession. These repealed
sanctions will not only bring cheaper prices for those

imarkets but will also allow Europe to export back to

South Africa, bringing even more money into those-

economies.

South Africa, however, has done "nothing to warrant this
gift from Europe. Blacks are still not permitted to vote.
The new laws, which may be passed in July, still do not
give the blacks of the country equal rights.

This is not to say that South Africa has not done some
things for blacks in that country. Many of the laws which
former President P. W. Botha stood firmly behind have
fallen by the wayside.

Some political prisoners, most notably Nelson Mandela,
have been released from prison. Mandela’s organization,
the African National Congress, once considered by the
South African government to be a terrorist organization,
has been legalized. The new laws to be considered injuly
were unheard of only a few years ago.

But until apartheid is abolished and universal suffrage
is instituted, these sanctions should remain in effect.
Otherwise, many more laws may not be repealed at all.

NEXT!

-For about the past week or
so, the media have been busy
alternately condemning/giggling
over the Kitty Kelley expose of
Nancy Reagan.

Does anybody really expect
anything more from a woman
whose chief contribution to
society was that fatuous “Just Say
No To Drugs” campaign?

I bet Nancy thinks we can put
an end to poverty by-telling the
homeless to buy a house.

Furthermore, Nancy Reagan
supposedly smoked pot and
carried on with Frank Sinatra.
The former allegation I find
unbelievable, for nobody ' as
uptight as she is could have ever
gotten stoned. Maybe if someone
had closed her mineral water with
LSD a couple times, the world
would be a more pleasant place
(or maybe that would just account
for her White House astrologer/
consultant).

right, perfect even  in a hellish,
bad—karma kind of way.

The following story is based on
the accounts of four of the six Pitt
 athletes who left the Pitt baseball
  team during the 1991 season
‘B because of actions by Coach Mark

 ’ Jackson. Four other players who

are currently members of the
team and feared reprisals spoke

and their comments supported
the evidence given by the ex-
players.

Attempts were made to get in
touch with Coach Jackson — in
order to hear his side of the story
— but he ignored numerous
phone messages and refused to
comment during an office visit.

One week before the start of
the 1991 Pittbaseball season, first-
year head coach Mark Jackson
announced an upcoming
scrimmage with Allegheny
Community College (Md.).

After the announcement,
redshirt junior Don Carpenetti
approached Jackson with a
scheduling conflict. Carpenetti’s
Environmental Biology class was
having a mandatory weekend
field trip, and he simply couldn't
f ., miss it if he wanted to pass the‘
class. ’

“When I told Coach Jackson
about the field trip, he wouldn’t
even look at me," said Carpenetti,
a walk-on pitcher from Nicholson,

 I Pa. “It was obvious, though, that

he was annoyed.”

One week later, Carpenetti,
who ﬁgured on receiving plenty
of playing time during a nine-
game road trip to Florida, was
benched.

“I planned on talking to him at
the end of the Florida trip,” said
Carpenetti, “but he made this big
speech to the team on who would
get to play. Uacksonl said playing
time would be based on good
grades, running drills and [weight]
lifting."

“Well, I'm always first or second
in all of the running drills, I’ve put
over 50 pounds on my bench
press (in the off-season);and I've

been on the athletic honor roll
several times. If I'm not going to

on the conditions of anonymity, .

play, who is?I figured at this point,
I didn’t want to play for a
hypocrite.” -

Carpenetti, who had a 0.00
earned-run average and an 8-1
record as a starting pitcher during
his senior year at Lackawanna
Trail High School, claimed that
Jackson doesn’t allow his players
to have schoolwork as a priority.
Baseball always comes first.

“Anybody who takes academics
seriously has a problem with
Coach Jackson,” said Carpenetti.
“He has a rule that you have to
come to all games. If you have a
class at the same time that is
mandatory, it doesn’t matter. You
have to go to the game.”

After returning from the Florida
road trip in which Pitt went 2-7
against predominantly Division
II and NAIA schools, Carpenetti
decided thatbaseball at Pittwasn’t
fun anymore and it was interfering
with his education, so he decided
to leave the team.

“I went up to Coach Jackson’s
office, and when I started to talk
to him, he wouldn’t look at me at
all. He just stared at his desk," he
said. _

Carpenetti said he’s talked to
most of the players on the team,
and a majority of them have
expressed interest in quitting.

“_A lot of guys would quit if they
weren't on scholarship,” said
Carpenetti. “Many of them are
sticking out the year because they
want summer classes paid for by
the athletic department.”

Rich Yuskas, a junior first
baseman from Waterbury, Conn.,
recently left the team because
Jackson didn’t allow him to make
a road trip with the team to play
the University of Connecticut,

which is near his hometown.

Yuskas claims thatJackson has
lost control of his team.

“The players are hating him
more and more,” said Yuskas,
who played in the competitive
Atlantic Collegiate Baseball
League last summer and hit close
to .300. “He has to be more
personable with his players
because right now his team hates
him. You just can’t have that."

Carpenetti said the players also

dislikejackson because he doesn’t
care about their health.

“Coach Jackson simply burned
out our pitching staff,” said
Carpenetti. “He would make our
pitchers throw many days in a
row, ready or not. Recovery time
is an individual thing for pitchers.
I could throw two or three days in
a row and be all right, but there
are some players on the team that
couldn’t.”

“Some players need a fewdays’
rest before they can throw hard
again, . but he -structured his
workouts around the hitters and
disregarded the pitchers’ health,”

said Carpenetti. “You could tell ‘

him you didn’t feel healthy
enough to throw, but he would
force you or threaten you with a
lack of playing time.”

Such overuse occurred during
games as well.

Relief pitcher Dennis Terzich
played in ﬁve straight games
during Pitt’s trip to Florida, and he
is now hindered by a strained
right rotator cuff and tendinitis in
his right elbow. ‘

Ron Rojtas, a redshirt
sophomore pitcher from Munhall,
Pa., had to leave the team a few
weeks ago because of arm
problems, the result of being
overworked by Jackson.

“When I came in this fall, I told
Jackson that I had arm surgery in
the past, and I had to rest my arm
occasionally. Jackson said that
[we’d] take it slow,” said Rojtas.

According to Rojtas, however,
once the season started, Jackson
began misusing his pitchers.

“We had three scheduled
doubleheaders in a row,” said
Rojtas, who was given a tryout
with the Pittsburgh Pirates during
his senior season at -Steel Valley
High School. “And Jackson then
switched a single game to a
doubleheader. We had 11 pitchers
with no scheduled rotation.
Pitchers never knew when they
were going to be called on, so we
always had to warm up and be
ready.”

“Jackson finally called us
together and told us we had no
balls and no pride," said Rojtas.
“He doesn’t know what it is like to

pitch with a sore arm. He never
pitched [in college]. It’s a lot
different than just throwing with

a sore arm. Pitching takes a lot“
more out of you.” ‘ .

Rojtas refused to quit the team,
however, even though he knew
his arm was constantly tired.

“I took his lecture personally,”
said Rojtas. “I pitched when I
could, and I pitched when I
couldn’t. I had to because he
made you feel embarrassed if you
complained.”

Eventually, Rojtas saw a doctor
about his arm problems and was
diagnosed with three major
ailments. Rojtas suffered from a
rotator-cuff impingement

(shoulder), ~bicipial tendinitis‘

(shoulder) and lateral
epicondylmitis of the elbow. All
of these are from overuse.

And Rojtas blamed Jackson for
his injuries.

“He knew when Icould pitch
and when I shouldn’t, but he
pressured me to throw anyway,”
said Rojtas. “I needed three days
of rest in between pitching if I

’ only pitched a few innings. If I

pitched more, I needed four days
off.”

“Once in practice [during recruit
weekend], I pitched 80 pitches

Jason Billings/The Pitt News

and had a day off,” said Rojtas.
“Jackson then needed a pitcher to
throw to hitters (so the recruits
could see batting practice), and
he told an assistant coach to get
me up andget me out there. But

I couldn’t throw any more.”

Rojtas decided that he needed
to talk to Jackson about quitting,
but Jackson broke three
appointments, including. a
scheduled meeting at 10 a.m.
Finally, Rojtas had enough.

“I tried to meet with him three ‘
times [on the same day] face to
face,” said Rojtas, who transferred
to Pitt from Scottsdale Community
Junior College in Arizona. “And
all I wanted to do was askfor

‘ ITIOFC I'€S[. If a CO3Ch can’t make

time for a player when he is
contemplating quitting, then the
coach isn’t doing his job.”

Rojtas said that Jackson once
got up in front of the team and
told the players that if they didn’t
like his coaching, then they could
“get the fuck out.” Jackson then
proceeded to tell the team that he
was going to have a good team,
and only a handful of the players
would be a part of it.

“This is the only team he has,”
said Rojtas. “You can’t say that

Pitt-PSU: A raw deal or are better suns on the horizon?

Well, it has happened again. The
immortal “king” of college football, the
one person every sports reporter goes to
for answers, has bestowed his wishes, thus
ending one of the most intense rivalries in
college sports. To some people, this was
even bigger than the birth of Christ.

Joe Paterno has chosen not to extend the
contract between Pitt and Penn State. Thus,
the two teams will never play again

(effective in 1993).

There are many reasons why this is a
great loss to the football community as
well as to the cities and schools involved.
In financial terms, it will definitely hurt
Pitt. Obviously, the Pitt-Penn State matchup
brings big bucks to the local Pittsburgh
merchants, hotels, restaurants and to Pitt in
general. Penn State won’t be affected,
because almost every game sells out.
This is usually the only game at Pitt that
sells out each season. In the last two
meetings at Pitt (’87 and ’89), Pitt Stadium

sold out with 56,500, and 57,158,
respectively. For some people, this is the
only game they come to. They take off
work, buy tickets for the whole family,
buy sweatshirts for the whole family —
not to mention food. That’s big money
that the university will be losing.
Secondly, this is as big a rivalry as any
in the world of sports. Obviously Paterno
doesn’t agree. He is throwing away 98
years of tradition and a game that is
eagerly anticipated by millions of fans

If you are from Pennsylvania, you know _
that the biggest part of the Pitt-Penn State
matchup is the fighting with your friends
when you were growing up. It was fun to
try to outdo your friends who liked the

behind us.

In 1992 the Pitt-Penn State football series
will end, but Pitt fans will still have several

In this ever-changing world nothing
ever stays the same, so why should
everyone place so much emphasis on the
Pitt-Penn State rivalry? One reason that
comes to mind is the fact that the rivalry
is a tradition, and central and western
Pennsylvania seems to be hell-bent on
traditions. But we have to put Penn State

It might be hard to live without the
series because hatred of Penn State — or
of Pitt for that matter— is seated deep in
the fans of both teams. We should follow
the words of William Wordsworth: “...
and grieve not, but only find strength in
what lays behind ..."

OK, OK, everyone doesn’t have to get
all choked up about the end of the Pitt-
Penn State football game. Pitt has a great

' deal number of opportunities..

John Labriola

The Panthers are a part of the newly
formed Big East football conference and
will basically be competing against the
same teams as in its past seasons, with the
added bonus of not dealing with PSU.

In the Big East, Pitt fans will be able to
see the Panthers go up against teams like

Boston College, Miami, Rutgers, Syracuse,

Temple, Virginia Tech and West Virginia.

Speaking of West Virginia, not only does
Pitt have a cross-state rivalry with PSU, but
it also has to deal with the Backyard Brawl
every season. With the absence of Penn
State, the Panthers can concentrate more
on the brawl. The Pitt-WVU series began in
1895, and within its 95 years Pitt has
dominated the series, holding a 54-266
advantage. In time, this series should prove

to be as big as the Pitt-Penn State
rivalry. It is already the biggest
rivalry in the new Big East
conference. '

Several other good points about
the end of the 98-year-old series:
Pitt fans will never have to drive
three hours across the state to be
pelted in the head by rolls of toilet
tissue and other things thrown by
Penn State fans.

By far, the best part about the
end of the series is that we’ll never
have to see Joe Paterno at Pitt

~ Stadium again, and we’ll never

have to see him run across Beaver
Stadium’s field and yell into a Pitt

‘ coach’s face, “You are a disgrace

to collegiate athletics.” Granted,
Paterno is a excellent coach, but
his personality needs some work.
One thing that will be sorely
missed will be the Pitt-Penn State
blood drive because this was a
great help to the Central Blood
Bank, as well as a shining moment
in collegiate athletics. We can
always try to start a new blood
drive with West Virginia, but it

wouldn't be the same.

Don't worry about Pitt fans
having to learn new words to the
victory song; you will always be
able to hear P—E—N-N-S-T SUCKS
when you’re in the stadium. As
the Led Zeppelin song says, “The
Song Remains the Same.”

edge. It’s just a matter of time.”

Erik Mertens, a redshirt fresh-
man from McMurray, Pa., said
Jackson never communicates with
his team.

“He never talks to his players,
and when he does, he doesn’t
look at you,” said Mertens, a three-
time WPIAL Section 7 All-Star at
third base. “Half the time you get
the feeling that he doesn’t care.
He’s just not a people person.
He’s simply a terrible commun-
icator.”

One of the biggest complaints
of the ex-players is Jackson’s lack
of compassion for his team.

“Some of the time when the_

team loses a game,” said Mertens,
“Jackson makes the guys practice
at 6 a.m. the next morning. Then
he’ll let the players who have an 8
a.m. class out at 7:55 a.m. After
showering, they’re already 20
minutes late for class. So don’t tell
me 'he’s concerned about
academics.”

“He’s more interested in putting
on a show for recruits than staying
loyal to his players,” said
Carpenetti. “His attention isn’t

 

centered on the players here.”

“He didn’t give the players who
have been around a chance to
play,” said Yuskas. “He hasn’t
given the guys with experience a
chance to use their experience.
Coach Jackson is looking to the
future while disregarding the
present. And the players don’t
like it.”

Pitt players aren't the only ones
who disagree with Jackson’s
methods.

Earlier in the year, the Pitt team,
led by Jackson, was involved in a
bench—clearing brawl with Rollins
College (Fla.). Fred Battenﬁeld,
the s ports-information director for
Rollins, said, “I' don’t expect
[Rollins] to play Pitt in baseball as
long as Coach Jackson is there.”

Jackson was also involved in a
shouting matchwith an assistant
coach from the University of
Indianapolis during Pitt’s 8-6 loss
on March 5.

“After we threw a Pitt player out
at second base, one of our players
yelled something like ‘Keep
sending them so we can keep
throwing them out,”’ said Bob

Tremain, the head coach of
Indianapolis. “Jackson took
offense and stormed out onto the
field and started bitching at our
ﬁrst—base coach, who had nothing
to do with it. It was very
unprofessional.”

Rich Spear, the head coach of
Duquesne, whose team was also
involved in a tight with Pitt earlier
this season, said that even though
an incident occurred between
Duquesne and Jackson’s team,
he didn’t think it would mean the
end of the Pitt-Duquesne rivalry.

Carpenetti spoke on the major
difference betweenJackson, who
led Pitt to a 12-21 record this
season, and last year’s head coach
Bobby Lewis, Pitt’s coach for the
last 36 years.

“There are different
perspectives at work here. Coach
Lewis is right on schedule.
