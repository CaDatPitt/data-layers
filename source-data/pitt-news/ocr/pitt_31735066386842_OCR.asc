Recent changes in the
student housing application
process have caused
some Pitt students some frus-
tration.

University
to purchase

apartment

By Stephen Kozarovich
Asst. News Editor

A new computerized lottery
and priority for younger Pitt
students reﬂect Pitt’s attempt to
create a fair housing system
and address Pitt’s “chronic
housing shortage,” according
to Director of Housing Services
Bob Hopkins.

Pitt’s current housing short-
age is ‘no secret to Pitt junior
Danielle Elias.

“And it’s becoming even
worse,” Elias said. “I just don’t
understand why they can’t deal
with it. I live five hours away. I
need housing. I can’t commute
like a lot of people.

“Why can’t they build a new
dorm?”

Instead of a new “dorm,”
how about an apartment build-
ing?

“[Pitt] is currently in the
process of purchasing an
apartment building on Centre
Avenue in North Oakland near
the busway,” Hopkins said.
“It’s a delightful contemporary
apartment building.”

According to Hopkins, the
building will be a 24-hour
security building that will be
equipped with all the essen-
tials that university residence
halls normally provide.

Pitt is buying the building to
provide extra space for stu-
dents interested in housing.
But, in order to live in the new
block of apartments next year,
students must not be allowed
to live in the residence halls.

Yes, student lottery numbers
must be invalid for the student

to be valid. More specifically, ,;

the building will be used as an ,

overflow to the residence halls,

not as a university apartment

building like those on Oakland

I expected to have my
first choice, but that’s not the
case.”

Elias said she is upset
because of a new change to
the application process that
assures campus housing to all
current first—year students.

The term “assure” comes
from Bob Hopkins, director
of Housing Services. According
to Hopkins, all incoming

housing, and current first-
year students are “assured"
housing.

The difference is that the
seniority rule, which gives pri-
ority to upper-class students in
choosing their housing, will no
longer be in effect. Pitt is plac-
ing priority on providing cam-
pus housing for younger stu-
dents.

could increase if those students

campaigns
at Pitt for
governor
elections

By Mark Gordon
Staff Writer

Promising to make Pennsylvania a bet-
ter place to live, State Senator Mike
Fisher spoke to the College Republicans
last night, outlining his campaign for
governor in the 1994 election.

“I want to turn Pennslyvania’s prob-
lems into results,” Fisher said. He added
he can do that by focusing “on the econ-
omy, crime and education,” while main-
taining his guarantee to downsize the
state government.

CR President Eric Lurie said he was
very excited about Fisher’s appearance.

“lFisherl really has a shot at winning
this race,” Lurie said. “The economic cli-
mate in this state has to be improved.”

The only way that this can be done,
according to Fisher, is to lower taxes
across the board, including tax breaks for
businesses. He said the breaks will
enable businesses to lower prices, creat-
ing a more competitive marketplace.
However, Fisher stressed the need for
more Pennsylvanians to get employment.

No more worries offnzzy television, cable is /oere

By Matt Groff
Asst. News Editor

The annoying sounds of early morning
drilling and workers’ voices in the hallways
have been a bittersweet experience for
Sutherland Hall residents this week.

“It will be worth it. Having cable means
we’ll be going from two channels to hope-
fully 40,” said Mike Raymond, a Sutherland
Hall resident who did not hesitate to admit
he is a couch potato.

After months of anticipation, workers are
in the process of running cable to each
individual bedroom in every residence hall
on the Pitt campus. According to Housing

. and Food Services Director Bob Hopkins,
‘ Amos Hall is already wired and activated

for residents to use.
“Because of where our room is located, it

is impossible to get a decent picture,” Amos
Hall resident Karen Miller said. “Now we’ll
be able to watch TV without constantly fix-
ing the antenna.”

According to Hopkins, installation per-
sonnel are now focusing on Sutherland.

“There have been a series of minor glitch-
es which prevented us from making our tar-
get date, Feb. 15 [for Sutherland],” Hopkins
said. “We are waiting for a final answer
from [Tele—Communications Inc.], but we
hope to have Sutherland’s cable activated
March 1 or soon after.”

At this point, some residents think the
rumors about cable are too good to be true.

“I’ll believe it when I see it,” Sutherland
Hall resident Mary Gerst said. “I know they
installed the cable wires, but from what I
can see, I think the decision is still up in the

2111'.

Hopkins said TCI will wait for every
room in Sutherland Hall to be hooked up to
cable before any individual ports are acti-
vated. Sutherland Hall has had cable in its
television lounges since it opened in the fall
of 1992, but many residents are upset with
the fact that it has taken this long for cable
to come to the rooms.

“They told us we were going to have it at
the beginning of the year,” Sutherland Hall
Resident Student Association President
Michalene Posel said. “People who live in
Sutherland have to pay more than any other
dorm, so we should have things like cable
and voice mail first.”

According to Hopkins, dormitories will
be offered “expanded basic service,” which
includes all channels T CI offers except pre-

mium channels such as Cinemax and HBO.

Student Health advises for chilling temperatures

As temperatures plummet like
they did last week, students
should be aware of injuries
from cold. Frostbite is a local-
ized cold injury caused by
exposure to freezing tempera-
tures. Body parts that are
exposed are most often affected
(ears, nose, cheeks, ﬁngers and
toes). '

Frostbite is classified as super-
ficial or deep. Superficial injury
involves the skin and subcuta-
neous tissue. The first warning
sign may be intense pain in fin-
gers or feet. The injured area
becomes white, waxy, soft and
numb. Upon thawing, the area
becomes flushed and painful.
Large blisters may develop
within 24 hours and last for
about 10 days. Throbbing pain
may last for several weeks and
the affected area may be sensi-
tive to heat and cold for

months.

Deep frostbite causes injury
to the skin, subcutaneous tis-
sue, muscle, tendon and neu-
rovascular structures. The
injured part is hard and solid
and remains  
cold, mottled 
and blue or gray  A
after thawing.
Edema occurs in
the entire area
and may take
months to re-
solve.

mild soap or detergent and
water and cover with a sterile

—Avoid injury to the thawed

—Avoid use of alcohol and

Proper medical attention is
absolutely necessary for any but

parts with one or several layers
of insulating clothing —
body, arms, legs, feet and face.
Wear a hat or covering

amount of heat is lost through

as wetness destroys insulating
power. Avoid wearing
tight clothes or shoes as this
can restrict blood flow, slow

injury.

BiGALA publishes second newsletter

By Robin Senor
Staff Writer

The Bisexual, Gay and
Lesbian Alliances second issue
of its newsletter, The Pride
Pages, is now available around
campus.

BiGALA produced their first
newsletter last December.

“It is a very big outreach
effort, but we still really
need help writing it,” Bi-
GALA co-President Sacha
Layos said at last night’s meet-
ing.

Member Chris Koch said that
any writing related to gay, les-
bian or bisexual issues is wel-
come.

“I just need people to write
articles, poems, whatever.
Some people do coming-out
stories. The next issue is com-
ing out on March 20,” Koch
said.

In other issues, BiGALA
members said they are hoping
to be involved in the
Youth Forum, sponsored by
the Human Relations
Commission.

“A couple of members from
BiGALA are going to speak in
a forum in front of the city
council. People will come
in and talk about their experi-

some say in what goes on
in public schools, we might
be able to get some outreach

programs started,” Layos
said.
Members also discus-

sed what they would like
to see happen in BiGALA
in the upcoming semester.
One of the most impor-
tant things, they said, is
starting a straight BiGALA
meeting.

“‘\Y/‘e want people to know
that you don’t need to be

the old system of picking

That way, she said,
she can blame herself if
she gets an invalid num-
ber.

According‘ to Hopkins,
the computerized lot-
tery system is the same as
any other computerized lot-
tery system and is just as
fair.

“Statistically, this is a
much fairer system,”
Hopkins said.

"Each student has the
same chance as every other
student.”

The computer selecting
system eliminates the prob-
lems of wasted time and one
person picking for a group,
Hopkins said.

In the past, Housing
Services has received a lot
of complaints about

the time spent by stu-
dents waiting in line to pick
their numbers, Hopkins
said.

Computerizing the lottery
also takes away the problem
of a single person trying
to pick numbers for se-
veral people, which
Hopkins said was a common
occurrence.

“This is a totally random
assignment," Hopkins said.
"The chances are the
same for every student
no matter when they come.
Not like when we had the
lines."

Housing Services worked
with the Resident Student
Association last year to find
out student input, according
to Hopkins.

“Students have to believe
in the integrity of the lot-
tery," Hopkins said. “They
don’t have to like the
results.”

PERSPECTIVE  

PAGE 5

THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 3, 1994

Out with old, in with the new

There have been some changes in the student hous-

ing applications process. Next year’s incoming class.

and this year’s first-year class are both guaranteed on-

-campus housing for next year. What this means is that

there are only 515 beds left for the upper class.

These are to be distributed by means of a new coin-
puterized lottery. The housing department says this sys-
tem is statistically more fair than the one used in previ-
ous years.

The upper class students have been misled. They are
no longer getting the fair access to housing that they
had before the changes.

There is no longer any seniority for these students. In
previous years, sophomores, juniors and seniors drew
lottery tickets for housing. Of the students who had
valid lottery numbers, seniors were given first choice,
then juniors, then sophomores.

Bob Hopkins, the Director of Housing Services said
that Housing is trying to focus on younger students to
help in the transition to college life. He also said this
policy comes in part from student reaction to polls con-
ducted last year by the Resident Student Association.

Incoming students should be guaranteed housing for
their first year. They don’t have the opportunity of the
previous year to find housing. They also have a large
adjustment from high school to ‘college and need the
chance to meet people in a structured setting.

The university draws students in and then tells them
they will be housed for only the first two years.
However, after more than two years, it isn’t feasible to
transfer from one school to another. Therefore, stu-
dents are stuck in the system and are faced with few
options. The university is not showing concern for
those students it knows won’t leave. '

Competition for. apartments will be earlier and more
intense. Students will begin looking for apartments
sooner and students will have to make the decision of
whether to wait to see if their lottery ticket is valid or
find an apartment and sign a lease they can’t get out
of. Out—of-town students are particularly stuck.

The university has purchased a building on Centre
Avenue. Originally it was intended primarily for gradu-
ate students, but now is to be offered to undergradu-
ates to help absorb the overﬂow from the on-campus
housing. It seems that all students, from this year’s
sophomore class up to graduate students, are being
shafted by these changes.

Students who have spent their time on this campus
and paid their tuition and room and board deserve a
fair shot at campus housing. While the university can-
not be expected to guarantee housing for every class
(though they have said this is one of their goals), they
should not guarantee housing for sophomores at the
expense of the junior and senior classes.

If The Pill i'\’ew.s‘ said the world was coming to
an end, would you believe it?

What is it that the leadership of The Pill News
Editorial Board is trying to prove? And why is it
that The Pitt News is always quick to attack stu-
dent groups on campus that are trying to make
constructive strides? As a victim of one of these
editorial attacks of The Pitt News I take my stand
— the buck stops here!

Who really likes The Pill News? If a poll were
taken of the campus community, I am almost
certain that the majority of students on this Cain-
pus would agree that The Pill News is being run
by individuals who believe that they can bully
groups or other individuals into believing the
way that they do. The Pitt News has a history of
conflicts with black folks on this campus, and

they have carried their tradition of misrepresen-

tation and slander to the level of a sinister and
wicked art form.

Led by Julie Sabol, a woman who has become
extremely unpopular for her practice of printing
half-truths and whole lies, again

beliefs. But what The Pill /\’ez('s didn‘t quote me
as saying at the Tolerance On Campus seminar
is that the Black Action Society has often been
misunderstood and misrepresented by The Pill
News and other groups on campus. Some ele-
ments of The Pill News editorial staff represent
the epitome of disrespect and undiversity here at
the University of Pittsburgh. -

The disrespect of The Pill Nezvs is manifested
in the way that, on Jan. 23, a white male was
sent to write a story on an all black women’s
event. Doesn’t The Pill News have any ethics?
Only an insensitive and disrespectful editor
would send a male REPORTER toa women’s
summit where sensitive issues were being dis-‘
cussed.

On another occasion on Jan. 25 the insensi-
tive, disrespectful The Pill News reporters tried to
argue their way into a Black Action'Society
General Body Meeting which is designed to dis-
cuss issues which are of importance to BAS
membership. Despite the fact that they were not

objective. The article written in
the editorial section of The Pitt
News on Jan. 27 should be looked on with
extreme skepticism. It was not written objective-
ly. It was only one sided. .

I was quoted as saying “It comes down to
respect. When I treat you like I want to be treat-
ed  that's what it comes down to.” The author
of this article went on to explain that “Despite
[my] invocation” of the “Golden Rule," it must
wondered how I would feel if I were told that I
couldn’t do an adequate job because I was
black. In this article the author puts his own evil
twist on what I said in order to try and press his
or her own agenda.

First of all, I did make that statement concern-
ing respect. it is my belief that the problem here
at the university is a lack of respect on the part
of some individuals for other groups of diverse

for their news distortions.

Students, faculty and administrators here at
Pitt, the Black Action Society is not by any
means racist. We are like any student group —
we are trying to make a constructive change. It
just so happens that the Black Action Society’s
mission is to address the. needs and concerns of
black students.

Since we are not the Student Government
Board or part of the larger Pitt administration,
we don’t pretend to try and meet all students
needs. And I leave this word of advice to all
other student groups: Beware of The Pitt News
Editorial staff —— If they lynch us today. they'll
lynch you tomorrow.

Michael S. Barge
BAS Vice Chairman

BAS as racist as the Klu Klux Klan

The Black Action Society, as a student organization, funded by student fees, must be disbanded.
Not only for the obvious discrimination-policy rules they have broken, but also for the apprehensi-
ble organization they have become. BAS leaders in the past have attacked The P1'ttNews, simply
because some of the editor names “look” Jewish and because they felt too many BiGALA representa-
tives were editors. They have also attacked the Jewish community at large in the past. Now, they
want their meetings closed, because some material might be offensive, and they would not want
anyone to know their true agenda — and who supports it. This is much like the Klu Klux Klan,

except BAS isn’t wearing black robes and masks, yet.

then we are talking
about a large number of
women form different cultures, back-
grounds, and ethnicitie. These are
women with different goals and expec-
tations for their lives, women with dif-
ferent political agendas and women
with different understandings of what it
is to be a feminist. The pop-culture def-
inition of a feminist is a man-hating les-
bian who is fanatical about politically-
correct speech and spends her free time
filing sexual harassment suits. This view
easily dismisses feminists and it is,
therefore, the one that the predominant-
ly male media has put forth. This is not
what a feminist is. In fact, there is no
simple definition of what a feminist is
or what the feminist agenda is. The
most basic feminist agenda is equality
for women, a critical approach to male-
constructed paradigms and the right to
choose whatever lifestyle a woman
wants for herself. This is not to the
exclusion of men. I believe that men
who believe in these basic things can
be feminists. How this agenda is
defined and acted upon is open to
wide interpretation. Feminism is a big
tent under which women and men of
radically different views reside.

If I had to divide feminism into easily
discernable factions, I would choose the
divisions that some social scientists
have described. There are garden-vari-
ety feminists who believe in the basic
tenet of feminism. There are social fem-
inists who believe that capitalism is the
evil and want to see socialism instituted
and finally, there are radical feminists
who believe that patriarchy is the evil
even to the point of seeing the nuclear
family as a small patriarchy. Across the
spectrum of these three groups you find
anti—choice and pro-choice feminists;
anti-pornography and anti—censorship
feminist; etc. Sweeping generalizations
of feminism are simplyia misunder-
standing of the true nature of feminism.

I acknowledge that I am using the
rhetoric that supports my arguments,
but this rhetoric represents the true con-
flict. The debate on abortion, among
everyone, is not about whether to abort
fetuses. I have never met a person who
said, “I want to see unborn fetuses
aborted.” The debate is about choice. I
am pro-choice and although I don’t

their will to carry chil-
dren or subject them to dangerous,
back-alley abortions? What if they don’t’
have money for prenatal care? In this
case we are condemning both mother
and child to poor health and endanger-
ing their lives. Ah, it will be a return to
the days when a women feared death
in childbirth or by illegal abortion.
Those were the days.

But, even with sex education and
contraception, I would still support
abortions for women who were raped
or victims of incest. These women do
not deserve to be violated once again
by carrying the children of rapists.

A return to the good old days is what
some people want. The good old days
were when men were men and women
were doormats. When I think of my
grandmother and the fact that she never
had a choice about what to do with her
life, I am appalled. She was told that
she couldn’t be anything but a house-
wife. Perhaps that is what she wanted
for her life, but how will we ever know?
She never got the chance to choose.

I am fully supportive of women who
want to stay home and raise children if
it is their choice. But, when a society,
education system and ecomonic system
tell women that they are breeders who
aren’t smart enough to be doctors,
lawyers, etc. Then, there is no choice. I
am a radical feminist, but, there are
many factions even within that subset. I
am also against censorship of porn (but
not kiddie porn and snuff films). I
believe that it is up to the individual to
choose whether of not they want to
consume porn. To go even further, I
believe that women can use porn as a
way to sexual autonomy. Women can
become aggressive, ask for what they
want and even use pron for its tradi-
tional use: masturbation.

As you can see, any attempt to draw
broad strokes when it comes to femi-
nism is impossible. This means that
each woman and man must become
educated and decide where they stand
on each issue. It is an insult to women
to believe that our beliefs, both political
and personal, could be easily compart-
mentalized.

POINT

...or friendly fire

There are two stories in the news last
week that I must comment on. They are
the Lorena Bobbitt trial and the anniver-
sary of Roe v. Wade.

First, let me start off by saying that I
feel the Bobbitt trials received too much
media attention as is, and

lence. They champion those who make
the so called choice for abortion, yet
never act when these women are
maimed — both physically and mentally
— by male abortionists, who make mil-
lions off of women’s bodies. They claim
they want government to

I really hate to give them
any more. Having said
that, I’d really like to dis-
cuss the strange phenom-
enon which arose during
the trial. The feminists

stay out of their womb,
yet struggle to get legis-
lated funding of abortion
(which, by the way, kills
more female babies than
males due to sex selec-

began placing this
woman in front of the
media as the patron saint for their agen-
da — a fine example for women every-
where. Surprisingly, it worked. and Ms.
Bobbitt got off on the defense that she
acted on an uncontrollable impulse.

As local disc jockey Jim Quinn point-
ed out, this is the same defense often
used by rapists. “I couldn’t control
myself.” I

The second story which caught my
eye was the celebration of the anniver-
sary of Roe 12. Wade by pro—abortionists.

Here on campus, and around the coun—_

try, people applauded the right to kill
the innocent in the name of women’s
rights (or female power). But how pow-
erful are a people who can only
demonstrate their power on the weak
(in fact, the weakest)?

Both of these stories are typical of the
feminist agenda today. They attempt to
show the woman as powerful, but in
reality do the opposite. Thinking over
the issue, I guess the point I’m really
trying to make is that the modern femi-
nist agenda has failed women and by
no means represents the majority of real
feminists.

The feminist movement today has lost
touch with the real issues for which
feminism was founded. Issues such as
the right to vote, equal pay for equal
work and tough penalties for rapists
and assaulters of women have really
fallen by the wayside.

Today"s feminists are dominated by
issues like government-sponsored abor-
tions, what I call “neo-sexual harass-
ment," and political correctness. In
other words, today’s feminists are more
about the liberal agenda than women
(as pro_ven by their love for Ted
Kennedy and Bill Clinton).

Not only do I believe that feminism is
not aiding women, but I propose that it
is actually detrimental to most women.
The radical feminists tell us that our
morality and God are dead, and then
get angered at the degradation and
exploitation of women in pornography.
They claim that men and women are
equal, but thenask for special privi-
leges. They tell us that the traditional
family is outdated and the father’s role
is useless, and then wonder why most
single mothers live in poverty and vio-

tion). They want women
to be strong, or so they
say, but continue their portrayal of
women as weak, feeble and incompe-
tent.

In addition to that, the modern leftist,
radical feminist agenda dismisses every-
one who disagrees with them, like me,
as chauvinist. Well, let me put. their
minds to rest. I am a chauvinist and
proud of it!

By chauvinist, I mean that I believe in
the ideals of chivalry. That code, the
chauvinist code, taught men to protect
those who were physically weaker than
themselves -— male or female, so they
were harsh with those who took advan-
tage of women.

The chauvinist code stated that
women were different than men —— bet-
ter, special and on a higher plain than
males. Therefore, women were respect-
ed.

When American men followed the
chauvinist code, there was less need for
a woman to worry about “date rape” or
cmde comments (which have now been
incorporated into sexual harassment),
because men had respect for women
unmatched by political correctness. For
example, I grew up learning that
women were different from men, and
whereas under certain circumstances it
might be appropriate to strike another
male, I was taught NEVER to strike a
female. And despite what many femi-
nists say, most men who believe this
don’t feel superior to women.

Neither male nor female is superior,
but they are decidedly different. Men
and women were designed in every
way to complement the other. I don’t
have the hips, pain tolerance or lower
body strength needed in order to give
birth, and women don’t, by nature, have
the shoulders, biceps and upper body
strength needed to do hard manual
labor.

I’d also like to say that I’m also a fem-
inist. I have a mother and sisters, and I
care about them deeply. I Want to see
women paid what they deserve, and
rapists taken off our streets. But today’s
radical feminism has failed my sisters,
failed my sisters, and my mother and
women as a whole.

Women's hoops improve to 15-3 with Win

Lady Panthers obliterate 1

By Ryan Buneher
Asst. Sports Editor

The Pitt women’s basketball team had
never beaten the Miami Hurricanes
before this season. Last night, as the
Lady Panthers went for the season
sweep in Miami, they had to do some-
thing they had not done all season.

“We haverrt had to come back from a
double-figure deficit and win a game,
and we did it,” Pitt head coach Kirk
Bruce said.

The Lady Panthers rebounded, shot,
defended (you get the point) from a 12-
point second-half disadvantage to win
59-53, raising their record to 15-3, 9-1 in
the Big East. Miami is now 7-12, 4-7 in
the conference.

Pitt dug itself a hole by not scoring a
pointfor nearly four minutes at the
beginning of the second half. Miami took

advantage by extending a 32-26 halftime

edge to a 38-26 bulge. Carolyn Miller
ended the Lady Panther drought with a
layup with 16:10 remaining in the game.

Pitt erased the deficit with an 11-0 run
of its own. Two free throws by Jonna
Huemrich put the Lady Panthers up 41-
40 with 9:08 remaining. Miami could do
no better than to tie the Lady Panthers
the rest of the way.

“We started making a few shots
inside,” Bruce said.  picked up up
on the defensive end of the floor. We
switched up defenses from man-to-man
to zone. They started missing some shots
and we started to rebound. That helped
the comeback because we started getting
some easy possessions.”

The Lady Panthers smothered the
Hurricanes on defense in the second
half, holding Miami to six-of-26 (23 per-
cent) shooting from the floor. While Pitt's
defense was better than usual, the
offense was far below what it has been
this season.

Pitt missed its normally potent three-
point shooting. The Lady Panthers, who

Senior Jill Colabrese, the team’s num-

Wennington NBA ’s new dunkmaster

Dateline Duncanland:

Surprise, surprise.

Look who’s still among the
NBA’s best —— the Chicago
Bulls.

Minus one guy named
Michael Jordan, the Bulls boast
the fifth-best record in the NBA
(30-11) and are one game
behind Eastern Conference
leaders New York and Atlanta.

How can the Bulls still be one
of the best without His Airness?

I have a two-word answer for
that.

Bill Wennington. Yeah, that’s
right, Bill Wennington.

With a crippled Bill
Cartwright in the middle,
Wennington has assumed a lot
of the responsibility at center.

The NBA journeyman who
has been out of the league for
two years has finally found his
first niche since his heyday at
St. _]ohn’s.

Averaging 8.4 points per
game, you’re probably saying,
“What's this guy talking about
-— he’s a bum.”

Since Wennington’s minutes
have increased, so have his

scoring and rebounding output.
In several games, Wennington
has gotten double figure points
and rebounds. He can hit the
jump-shot, and he can dunk.Oh
man, can he dunk.

Recall: The Christmas night
game between the Bulls and the
Orlando Magic. A classic match-
up Shaq vs. Wennington. In
tha6t game I, along with half of

Sean
Duncan

the country, witnessed one of
the best dunks in history —- and
no, it wasn’t by Shaq.

Here’s the scenario: B.j.
Armstrong pulled up for a
jump-shot. The ball ricocheted
off the back Iron, but wait, here
comes Wennington barrelling
down the lane. Wennington
jumped and caught the ball in
mid-air a little inside the dotted
circle with his body angled and
did a tomahawk dunk over the

NBA mid-season awards out, Hakeem wins

whole Magic team — reminis-
cent of jordan’s “kiss the rim”
dunk.

So, as the All-Star weekend is
just around the corner, you can
take Shawn Kemp or Harold
Miner in the slam dunk contest
—— I’ll take Wennington
(although his past scrub status
didn't merit an invite).

All—Star weekend marks the
middle of the NBA season. So
let’s see how the personal
awards fare this far.

MVP: Sorry Patrick Ewing; I
know he has been waiting in
line for a while, and finished
second or third in past votings.
His 25.2 point per game aver-
age, fourth in the league, is very
impressive, and without Ewing,
the Knicks would be pretty
sorry. But like in the years past,
he has to take 21 back seat —
just like his teams always do.

David Robinson is posting his
best season with a 27.8 scoring
average, and the league’s third-
best blocked shot total, but he
will be sitting right next to

For the Pitt News

The men’s swimming and div-
ing team will get back into
action tonight at 6 p.m. against
the No. 10-ranked Ohio State
Buckeyes in Columbus. Pitt (7-1
overall — 3-0 in the Big East) is
coming off an extremely
impressive win over Big East
rival Villanova. Both the swim-
mers and divers dominated en
route to a 162-79 blowout.

Will the Panthers be able to
swim with the same intensity
and purpose tonight as they did
on Saturday afternoon? Head

coach Chuck Knoles doesn’t see
why not.

“Ohio State is in a position
that the University of Pittsburgh
would like to be in as far as
ranking is concerned, they are
consistently in the Top 20,”
Knoles said.

“We’ve made some great
strides in the four years since
I’ve been here ——- trying to ele-
vate the program to that level ——
we get a little closer to them
every year, and I think that a lit-
tle bit of pride is at stake here.

stronger team than we are — it
would definitely be a phenome-

there and win. The chances of
that happening are not very
great, although we'll give them
a race. But most importantly it
gives us the opportunity to
compete with a team at the
level that the University of
Pittsburgh would like to be at
within one to two years.”

Senior captain Zach
Economos feels that Pitt needs
to maintain the drive they had
against Villanova and also, “step
it up to the next level for this
meet.” He also added, “We
would like to be confident, but
anticipate a hard time, yet we
still remain optimistic.”

Even though many people are
counting the Panthers out of
this one, those same people
would not be surprised if they

THE PI'IT NEWS,Thursday, February 3, 1994

kept it a competitive meet.

“I am familiar with the Ohio
State team," said junior captain
Matt Brady.

“They are fast, strong and
deep, but definitely not unbeat-
able. I think we have a very
good chance to win. The
Villanova win was important
because it was a conference
win, but Villanova is not
ranked. Beating Ohio St. would
help us crack the Top 25.”

On the diving side of things,
senior captain Sean Braud said,
“It is well within the realm. If
we beat them, we will all be
diving extremely well."

However, Ohio St. has one of
the top divers in Division I. He
is sophomore Yoshimora
Sakata. Sakata was also chosen
as an alternate on the 1992

Swimmers see in Ohio 51‘. what they hope tohecome

Japanese Olympic diving team.

“His work ethic is amazing,”
said Braud, who dove with
Sakata in Florida over the sum-
mer. “He is in the top five in the
one, three and ten meter dives,
and with his exception we
should definitely be able to win,
because we all dive well under
pressure.”

With the end of the regular
season rapidly approaching, the
team definitely looks like they
are in position to recapture the
Big East title which was taken
away last year by Villanova after
nine consecutive years on top.
With the exception of the loss to
Penn St. on Jan. 8, the team has
won all their meets with ease,
and even though they lost to the
Nittany Lions, it was only by
four points.

Continued from page 1
Cable will be included in room
and board costs, and no indi-
vidual contracts will be neces-
sary.

Hopkins said TCI is sched-
uled to move on to
Bruce, McCormick and Forbes
halls after Sutherland. TCI
will be sending two
teams of installers when work
begins on these residence
halls. He stressed that all on-
campus residences, including
fraternity houses, will be
hooked up in the coming
months.

“Much of this process
depends on the availability
of existing lines,” Hopkins
said. “Buildings that need
more work for installation

will be ﬁnished during the sum-
mer.” -

Even though Sutherland Hall
resident Craig Hinden said he
expected cable a long time ago,
he said he is glad to be in a res-
idence hall which is almost
completed.

“There’s always somebody in
the lounge watching something
other than what we want to
watch,” Hinden said. “Now we
can stay in our room and get a
clear picture.”

Tower B resident Gretchen
Bucher said she is not surprised
Tower B will not be getting
cable any time soon.

“What can we expect? It’s the
Towers, and we seem to be the
last to get everything,” Bucher
said.
