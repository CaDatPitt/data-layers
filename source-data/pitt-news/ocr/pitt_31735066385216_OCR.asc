Dukakis  

By Lou Grieco
Staff Writer

Jesse Jackson Jr., son of the
former presidential candidate,
warned students that their civil
rights would be in danger if Vice
President Bush is elected, and en-
couraged them to vote for
Michael Dukakis at the William
Pitt Union yesterday.

”The generation of the '80s
must accept our chaIlenge,” Jack-
son said. ”You owe it to those
who fought for your right to
vote.”

Jackson defended liberals, call-

O. ing 19th-century slave owners

men of ”traditional values with a
superiority comp|ex.” He also
called the men who wrote the
Constitution conservative, be-
cause they denied women and
blacks the right to vote.

Student apathy at the Universi-
ty of ‘Pittsburgh was cited as
perhaps the most important issue
facing the university at the Stu-
dent Government Board’s ”Meet
the Candidates” presentation
held last night.

The fact that there is a single
SGB presidential candidate has
been, attributed to apathy, among
other things. Because of the situ-
ation, write-in candidates will be
allowed on Election Day, but

Apathy major issue discussed at SCB candidate night

these people were not permitted

to take part in last night's’

meeting. g
”Apathy is a severe problem on
this campus,” said board candi-

. date Robin Dionne.

Candidate Julie Shepard said
that it is important for students
not only to study, but to get in-
volved with the university in ord-
er to get the most out of their
college experience.

”I believe a major task facing
the board this year is to try to
combat the rise of student apa-
thy,” said candidate C. Harper

Waters.
Perhaps the solution to this
problem most agreed upon by

the candidates is to increase the

quality of communication be-

tween the board and students.
Some solutions mentioned last

night were to increase the promo-
tion of SGB-sponsored events,
such as the SGB talk show on
WPTS, and to make information
about student organizations avail-
able immediately to incoming
freshmen.

Kent Baldauf, who is running
uncontested for SGB president,
said, ”I believe the single most
important quality [an SC B] presi-
dent must possess is experience.”

Balduaf, a junior, presently
serves on the SGB as president
pro tem. He is also a member of
the University Senate Committee

on Student Affairs. Last year, he
served on the SGB’s allocations
committee.

At the presentation, each of the
10 candidates present were al-
lowed to give a short speech. Af-
ter all of the candidates were
finished, the special interest
groups present were permitted to
question the candidates.

Questions ranged from how
the SGB could help smaI|—interest
groups such as the Pitt Water Ski
Club attain notoriety to how the
board could assist in alleviating
current dormatory problems.

In 1969, only one college in
the United States offered a pro-
gram of courses concerning
women and related issues.
Now there are over 500 simi-
lar programs, 26 of which offer
doctorates.

Since its inception in 1972,
the Women’s Studies Program
at the University of Pittsburgh
has grown from five course
offerings and threecore faculty
members to nearly 80 courses
taught by over 50 professors
from different departments
throughout the university.

”|t’s really an exploding area
in academics,” said Carol
McAllister, interim director of
the program. The course offer-
ings of Pitt’s WSP range from
history and literature courses
to anthropology and physical
education classes.

Students can complete an
undergraduate certificate or a
graduate minor in the pro-
gram. Many students also par-
ticipate in women's studies
courses which are cross-listed
with other departments to
satisfy general education or
elective requirements.

Approximately 30 students
are currently pursuing the pro-

gram certificate, McAIIister
said.

In addition to teaching, WSP
has three other functions.
McAIIister said the most im-
portant is sponsoring programs

related to gender, race and na-
tionality issues.
The WSP works to bring

Pitt Women's Studies Program offers alternative education  

speakers, seminars and work-
shops to the university.

WSP faculty also engage in
research in their respective
fields. WSP sponsors the
Research Associate Program to
enable researchers who are
completing work in women's
studies or related fields to use
university facilities such as
computers and library materi-
als to complete their projects.

McAllister said WSP is also
interested in improving the sta— —
tus of women as a whole in
the university and the commu-
nity. A WSP task force has
reported to Provost Rudolph
Weingartner a plan ”to inte-

grate gender, race and nation-
ality into the university
curriculum as a whole.”

Female students make up
the majority of enrollment in
the program.

”MaIe enrollment is very
low, but I wish it was higher.
Women's studies isn't just ad-
ding women, it's more like ad-
ding and stirring. This
produces a whole new set of
questions about women and
men and their relationships,”
McAllister said.

”We have made a more ex-
plicit commitment to relate to

minorities,” McAlIister said.

Kidnappers release videotape of hostage Anderson.

BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -
American hostage Terry Ander-
son, in a videotape released Mon-
day by his kidnappers, read a
statement that accused the Rea-
gan administration of blocking
his release and urged the next
president to do more.

President Reagan denied inter-
fering with efforts to free Ander-
son, and his chief spokesman,
Marlin Fitzwater, denounced the
tape as ”a cynical attempt” to in-
fluence the Nov. 8 election.

Copies of the two—minute,
35-second tape were delivered to
two Western news agencies in
Beirut four days after Anderson,
41, marked his fourth birthday in
captivity.

Statements from the pro-Iranian
Islamic Jihad, which holds Ander-
son, accompanied the tapes.

”On the occasion of Terry An-
derson's birthday and in response
to your letters, and according to

his desire to send you a record-
ed message, we hereby enclose
with this statement the recorded
message on videotape,” the kid-
nappers said.

Bush, Quayle taunt
Dukakis’ liberal cry

The Republican ticket of Ge-
orge Bush and Dan Quayle snick-
ered Monday at Michael
Dukakis’ late campaign declara-
tion of liberalism in the race for
the White House. Dukakis was
running as heir to a great
Democratic tradition of ”caring
government” as he struggled to
gain ground.

”Miracle of miracles,” taunted
Bush, who has waged a
campaign-long effort to depict
Dukakis as a liberal outside the
mainstream. Quayle said he was
glad the Massachusetts governor

had resolved his politica
tity crisis.”

Dukakis invoked the names of
Roosevelt, Truman and John F.
Kennedy as he campaigned in
California, saying those
Democrats stood for ”caring
government and caring political
leadership. That's the kind of
president I want to be.”

Public polls continued to show
Bush and Quayle as the solid
leaders in the race over Dukakis
and running mate Lloyd Bentsen,

Walesa vo ws to fight
closing of shipyard

WARSAW, Poland (AP) — An 7

infuriated Lech Walesa vowed

Monday to fight government
plans to close down the Lenin
shipyard, the site where the
Solidarity trade union was born.
The state-owned shipyard in
Gdansk is being closed down
Dec. 1. It is the first big industri-
al plant to be singled out for
closure by the month-old govern-
ment of Prime Minister Mieczys-
law F. Rakowski, who has
pledged to get rid .of unproduc-
tive and inefficient enterprises.

The decision was announced
while the shipyard was closed on
the eve of All Saints’ Day and

‘caught many workers and

Solidarity activists by surprise.
The yard reopens Wednesday.

A longtime foe of Solidarity,
Rakowski took office Sept. 27
with a pledge to restructure
Poland's aging industrial base
and get the economy moving. In

an interview with the BBC, he
said the decision ”has nothing to
do with Solidarity.”

’’In New York Ha-rbor stands
not the statue of conservatism,”
Jackson said. ’’It. took them [liber-
als] years of winning and losing
struggles, but they never lost sight
of what side they were on.”

He said that conservatives mis-
lead the public through their use
of language. Jackson said that
”poor people steal, rich people
embezzle. Just big words mean-
ing the same thing.”

Jackson added the ”states’
rights” movement as an example
of using language to cover up
conservative movements. He said
that people like former Sen. Bar-
ry Goldwater tried to use states’
rights to avoid following civil
rights legislation.

”Those who liberate invest in
people. That's why we defeated
Judge Bork, and that's why we
must defeat George Bush,” He
said.

Jackson, said that the candi-
dates’ television commercials did
not answer the lquestionsof the
public. He called the vice presi-
dent's commercials ”Bush Lite
commercials. High on calories,
low on substance.”

He also attacked Bush for sup-
porting apartheid in South Africa,
running pictures of a black man
in anti—Dukakis commercials and
for calling his father ”a Chicago
hustler.”

’’I’m not even sure that Dan
Quayle knows that Nelson
Mandela is in jail,” Jackson said
of the senator's qualifications for
vice president.

Jackson echoed Sen. Bentsen’s
comment that Sen. Quayle was
”no Jack Kennedy,” because
Kennedy was a war veteran who
ran unsuccessfully for the
presidency in 1956.

”QuayIe inherited from the top
down what Kennedy worked for

BROTHERS DUNLAP

from the’.bottor'n‘up'..'Da_n Quayle
ducked the Vietnam War, which
coming from a hawk sounds pret-
ty chicken to me,” Jackson said.

Jackson defended Dukakis’
lack of passion, saying that
”presidents provide programs,
not passion.

He also told the crowd not to
be ”more upset than Jesse Jack-
son is” about Dukakis’ not select-
ing him as a running mate. He
said that Dukakis supports many
programsthat will benefit blacks.

Jackson said that voters should
not listen to the polls. He cited
the 1960 election as an example,
when Kennedy won by less than
one vote per precinct.

When asked about his father's

political future, Jackson said,’

”Right now we're running for
cover, trying to get Dukakis
elected.”

THE PITT NEWS

By Ed Kuznik
Staff Writer

Pitt's men's soccer team ended
a disappointing season yesterday

' by bowing to Indiana University

of Pennsylvania, 2-0, at Pitt
Stadium.

lUP’s Rich Whitmore was the
Panther killer on the afternoon,
scoring two unassisted goals on
Pitt breakdowns in the second
half. Brian Connell made eight
saves to record the shutout and
thus lower Pitt's overall record to
6-8-1 (1-3 in Big East compe-
tition). ‘

”I think this is very disappoint-
ing,” Pitt coach Joe Luxbacher
said of his squad’s play. ”We did
not play well at all. We only have
four or five guys doing the job.
We played well but couldn't
score goals  that's‘ the story of
our season.”

Indeed, yesterday afternoon's
contest epitomized Pitt's frustra-
tions for the year. The Panthers
had their fair share of scoring
chances, especially in the second
half, but could not get on the
scoreboard for one reason or
another.

The first occurred with about

40 minutes left in the contest,"

when Pitt's Scott McCurry put a
low-skimming shot that deflected
around and in Connell’s arms
and came close to bouncing free
to a wide-open Panther.

I _App_[o_xirnat_ely five__ minutes
later, Pitt freshman striker Mike
Laus broke free down the right
sideline and fed a perfect cross-
field pass to teammate Sam Lan-
za. But alas, the senior could not
one—time the ball into the net, as
his shot rocketed harmlessly over
the top of the cage. Laus would
later miss a scoring chance him-
self, this time on a rebound.

At the 31:29 mark, Whitmore
finally broke the scoring drought.
After McCurry made a great
defensive play, manning the front
ofthe net and stopping an Indi-
ana shot that was ticketed for the
back of the net, the IUP sopho-
more waited on the right side of
the net to drill the eventual win-
ning goal.

Whitmore then put the finish-
ing touches on the Panthers by
taking advantage of a mistake
from the opposition. Dan Libera-
ti, the closest Pitt player to the
ball on the play, explained: ”My
sweeper called me off; it was just
a breakdown in communi-
cation.”

The setback brought to a con-

, clusion a grueling 1988 Panther

campaign, as Pitt was plagued
with the inability to score key
goals when they had to all year.
This was not a team that was a
prime candidate to finish the sea-
son with a losing mark.

”The first thing I'd like to say
is that, coming in, I was really op-
timistic,” Liberati said in the lock-
er room after the game. ”We had
some good freshmen coming in,
and I thought we had things go-
ing for us. But for some reason
we just didn't gel. We got caught

in a rut.

“In my opinion, we should
have only lost three or four
games, not eight. We lost a lot of
close games this year because of
a breakdown. Today was a good
example’.

”But we did have a fair season.
Everybody gave 1 10 percent un-
til the end.”

Jon Ascher, who along with
Liberati and Lanza, was co-
captains, had similar feelings.
”We were all pumped up when
the season began. But midway
through the season, we had a
couple of breakdowns and

couldn't seem to get on track.” ‘

The senior defenseman also
stated that he did not want to

place the blame for the sub-par

season solely on an offense
which never could grab their ad-
versaries by the throat.

”Dan and I wanted to come in
and do well defensively. We're
like a family here. But there were

a couple of breakdowns here and
there. We just gave up some
goals that we shouldn't have
given up.”

The defeat not only marked the
end of another fall sport, but it

also meant that eight Panther
careers have concluded. Besides
the three captains, Mark Hen-
dricks, John Osberg, Chris Rid-
ing, Matt Segedy and Jeff Vargas

are all upperclassmen.

”Now you have to look for-
ward to going on to bigger and
better things in life,’’ Ascher said.

’ Barkley may be the best» player in

I

Just a few pieces from a sports
weekend: .

0 After watching the Philadel-

.phia 76ers and the Houston
Rockets face off at the Civic Are-
na last Saturday night, there is no
doubt in my mind that Sixers’ for-
ward Charles Barkley is not only
the most exciting player in the
NBA, but the best.

He has the ability to take the
game to another level, sort of like
Julius ”Dr. J” Erving did for so
many years. Now, there may be
arguments for Michael Jordan,
Larry Bird or Magic Johnson, but
Barkley can do everything on the
court. Jordan is a master scorer,
so is Bird. Johnson was the same
type of player as Barkley, but that
was three years ago.

Barkley has the ability to run
the floor, fire up the crowd and
his teammates, bang the boards,
score, dish out assists and com-
pletely control every facet ofthe
game. One look at last season's
stats (951 reboundsgan average

of-28.3 points a game, 103‘

blocked shots and a 59 percent
clip at the free throw line) prove
how good he really is. Like him
or not, Barkley is the best player
in the game today.

0 There was an interesting
matchup during the basketball
game. The Rockets’ starting guard
Eric ”Sleepy” Floyd and Sixers’
backup David Wingate both

played for Georgetown Universi- ~

ty. Granted, they played at differ-
ent times (Floyd graduated in
1982 and Wingate graduated in
1986), but they do share the same
backround.

Both players were very in-
strumental in the Hoyas’ game-
plan and were considered top
prospects coming out of college.

Floyd has been more influen-
tial in the pros. He was a starter
for the Golden State Warriors
since coming into the league and
last season was traded to the
Rockets. He is expected to play
a big part in Houston's success

this season.

’’I have a positive outlook this
season,” Floyd said. ’’I think we
have a very good team, and I

   

VINCE
CAREY

think we can win it.”
As far as his old school is con-
cerned, Floyd thinks Georgetown

-will be tough to beat.

”They look really tough,"
Floyd said. ”They’ll be one of the
favorites to win it.”

0 Well, everything is pretty
much back to normal in the NFL.

The Cleveland Browns (a
favorite to win it all) shot down
the upstart Cincinnati Bengals on
Sunday. With Bernie Kosar back
in control of the offense, the
Browns will once again win the
AFC Central and make it back to
the AFC championship game.

0 How about them Rams? They
look like a legitimate team this
season. With a 7-2 record, the
Rams are tied with the New
Orleans Saints for the Western-
division lead.

This Sunday they traveled to
the Bayou to play the Saints, and
everybody counted the Rams out.
Led by a strong defense, L.A.
manhandled New Orleans to win
the game 12-10. They sent the
Saints reeling out of first place.

0 San Francisco quarterback
Steve Young looks like he may be
able to live up to his promise af-
ter all. Young is another BYU
quarterback who set all kinds of

graduate school. Not playing soc-
cer is not the end of the world.
It's just unfortunate that-, we
couldn't have had a winning
season.”

who, up until now, hasn't done
much on the pro level.

Against the Vikings on Sunday, ‘

Young took things into his own
hands in the fourth quarter with
a brilliant TD run to win the
game. If Joe Montana sits out too
long, he might just lose his job.

0 I don't know how many peo-
ple out there were’ rooting for
West Virginia to lose this
weekend, but they did look damn
good. They totally thrashed an
outmanned Penn State and se-
cured themselves in the Nation-
al Championship picture.

I don't think it will happen.
They will lose their final game to
Syracuse in Morgantown. Book
it.

0 The Penguins are on a roll
right now. But they were on a roll
this time last year. After living in
Pittsburgh for three years, I am in-
clined to think that they will falter
again this season.
