A  Mann I Notes

Budget Shift

Two black-robed speakers at
the Commencement ceremonies
of the Graduate School of Bus-
iness discussed two important
changes in attitude before a large
audience gathered in the Com-
mon Facilities Building to see
their sons, brothers, husbands and

" boy friends receive long-awaited

degrees.

-Robert E. Kirby, Chairmen of
the Board of Visitors, revealed.
one innovation when he announced

that the colors of the School

had been ‘changed from drab to

.l L sapphire blue.

The second guest at the Gradu-

. ation talked on a much broader

plain. Maurice Mann, Assistant
Director of the U.S. Bureau of the
Budget, told his listeners that‘ in
the last five years 3/4 of the nation-
al budget spending has shifted to
an emphasis on human and social

_ resources.

The Nixon administration as-
sumed office with a backlog of
dissatisfaction with economic
conditions, said Mann. The escala-
tion of the war in Viet Nam and
a situation of serious infla-
tion, combined with tremendous
pressures for social change for-
ced the President and his co-
horts to re-evaluate budgetary
priorities, continued the Mann.

“There were limited resources
and a lack of response from gov-

ernment institutions. The presi-

dential election was the test of
these conditions,” he went on.

According to Mann, the new
government set as its goals
economic prosperity with price
stability. This means provid-
ing economic opportunity and
social welfare programs with a
wider sharing policy.

,“But the economy needs re-
straint. We must restructure pri-
orities, and the allocation of re-
sources. After all, time is money.,”
closed Maurice Mann.

 l Meteorite Discovered-

Prof. Probes‘Asieroid Field

discovered this summer what sci-
entists believe to be the sixth
largest meteorite ever recorded.

The discovery of the estima-
ted 18-ton object was made at
Campo Del Cielo, a meteorite
field located in the semiarid
plains known as the Gran Chaco,
about 600 miles northwest of
Buenos Aires.

The meteorite is still embedded
in about 15 feet of ground at the
site, is roughly triangular in
shape, approximately four feet
thick. -

Dr. Cassidy led the first sci-
entific expedition to the Campo
del Cielo eight years ago, when he
was with Columbia University's
Lamont Geological Observatory,
three months
every summer in Argentina ex-
amining the area, funded by the
National Science Foundation.

Dr. Cassidy reportedthat the
area is filled with meteorites. “I
had thought in 1962 when I first
began the profect,” he said,
“that it would be strictly a one-
summer project, but when we got
there we found three new era-
ters and discovered that in some
areas we couldn’t search more than
a few seconds with the detectors
without finding a new meteorite.
We got 500 specimens from a
sampling" of much less than one
per cent of the central area.”

The discovery of the meteor-
ite is important, because of what
scientists can learn about
asteroids and their relationships
to the atmosphere, according to
Dr. Cassidy, and he says that a
great deal of work remains to be
done at Campo Del Cielo.

Dr. Cassidy, 41, who holds a doc-
torate in geochemistry from Penn
State, has visited most of the me-
teor craters in Australia on a
Fulbright Fellowship, has done

meteoritic research in Thailand,

and has studied the large Aouel-
loul meteorite crater in the Wes-
tern Sahara.

A professor at the University for
two years, he is also part of the
three-man team from the Univer-
sity that will be studying lunar
material brought back by the Apol-
lo 11 astronauts.

He hopes, funds permitting, to
be able to go back next summer
to study his newest and largest
find, but he eventually wants to
see the University in Resistencia,
Argentina, gradually take over
the project.

“I also hope the Argentines
will make a national park of the
meteorite field,” he said, “and
I also would like to see my me-
teorite either remain in its site
or stand in a museum just next to
the crater.”

Brom hill To Define’

by HARRIS MILLER
Staff News Writer

Many changes have occurred
within the College of Arts and
Sciences during the past year,
but perhaps one of the most sig-
nificant has been largely ignor-
ed. Last spring, the Arts and
Sciences Review Committee, un-
der the direction of Economics
Professor David F. Bramhill, was
formed.

The first objective of the com-
mittee, according to Bramhill, is
for “the committee to agree to
hold open hearings.” He pointed
out that although the commit-
tee consists of five faculty mem-
bers and himself, the committee
will try to communicate, and
to exchange information.

“The primary problem the com-
mittee has to deal with,” explain-
ed Bramhill, “is what a university
education is about.” In Bramhill’s
opinion, “the CAS is not to turn
out a professional with a high
skill. Where many people com-
plain that they do not want a doc-
tor who did not have enough study
of medicine, or that they do not
want an engineer who designed
his own courses, they do not
realize that they are not discus-
ing a liberal arts education.”

Some specific problems that
the committee will deal with

COME SEE!

  

 

David f. Brahmill
include organization of the CAS,

requirements, grades, the distinc 
tion between curricular and extra- ‘ ‘5

curricular activity, and the eco-
nomic problems related to all
changes.

Bramhill stated that he hopes to
put out a report on these areas
before the beginning of March.
He would like to see, “a lot
more options and responsibility
open to undergraduates. He is in
favor of a “pass-no credit” sys-
tem.

“Ideas in education, “according
to Bramhill, “are changing. Learn-
mg -isn’t simply an injection of
knowledge; it is involvement. The
world has changed a lot since
World War II, and students expect
a different type of education.”

“Education should, and 'is,” L

stated Bramhill, “being shifted
to something people could care a
lot about.”

Create a script that places four
teenagers on Fire Island for the
summer, throw in a dash of breast
exposure, add a joint of grass,

sprinkle lightly with smidgens of

homosexuality, “birdicide,” mig-
gings, and flowing obscenities,
then ice the entire collage with a
nifty rape scene for a slam—bang
climax, and you’ve got yourself
one helluva movie about the trou-
bled youth of today, right? Wrong.

Frank Perry's Last Summer
seems to be an attempt to explain
some of the reasons for today’s
young being rebellious and dis-
gusted with “establishment” val-
ues, but the effort fails miserably.
Mr. Perry has totally bypassed
the youth of the sixties and sub-
stituted kids left over from the
forties and fifties; in short, freaks
they ain’t. —

Briefly, Last Summer tells of
three teenagers, a horny «insensi-
tive boy, a horny insensitive boy
speckled with sensitivity, and an
exhibitionist-oriented girl with a
154 IQ‘who gets her kicks by re-
moving her top, killing trained
seagulls, and getting Puerto Ri-

f cans drunk and mugged on an em-

pty stomach. Hmmmn.

These three form a triumvirate
whose bond is cemented by a de-
vastating game where each mem-
ber must tell a “major truth”;
you know, a “major truth” like
the time you gave your cousin a
sandwich made out of crackers,
cream cheese, and snot. Really
folks, its in the script. E 

They do all kinds of fun things
to show how representative they
are of the “youth.” Sandy, the lead-
er of the three, coins phrases lke
“that’s a bunch of crap” and “go
suck your mother’s tit.” (That’s
new?) Dan, the horny insensitive
guy, buys prophylactics (that’s
new?) fondles Sandy’s,breast in a
highly unerotic sequence that
takes place in a movie house
(that’s new?), and procures a
whole joint for all three to share
(that’s sort of new).

The unfortunate things about
the grass scene are that (1) he has
to get it from his parents, and (2)
all three get stoned after two tokes
on a first high, surely a new rec-
ord. Peter, the Henry David Tho-
reau of the group, just wants to be
an aquanaut. A what?

Enter Rhoda, a plump, wire-

toothed 17 year old psychoanalyst
from Cleveland who disrupts the

happy troika. She plays the truth

grave, much worse than snotting
up a sandwich), falls in love with

and Sandy hold her down. By the
way, after threatening to give the
audience an extended look at her
mammaries for the entire pic-

ture, Sandy finally does, and it’s

one, of the biggest downs on record.

Clearly, Eleanor Perry's script
suffers from too much shock and
too little accuracy. These kids are
not kids, they’re just the vicious
part of the older generation wait-
ing to growup. This movie is not
an inside look at today’s youth, at
least not the lovers of Woodstock;
these four are the future divor-

.cees, sex neurotics, and members

of the Duquesne Club.

One _plus for the movie, how-

Reflections
The Trash Pile
by DAVE TIERNAN
Editor, The Pitt News

There were once three little children playing in an al-
ley with many tall buildings on either side of it. The chil-

dren had found bits and pieces of paper, wood, oily cloth

and other combustable materialnwhich had been discarded
from the. buildings. They toiled for hours putting the trash
into a pile, then went in search of some matches.

If one were to ask an administrator on this campus
what I do in my spare time, I’d bet he’d _say I spend it look-
ing for matches. He would tell you that I helped build a
trash pile that could explode at any minute. What he would-
n’t tell you is that he was one of the ones who threw the
trash out the window.

The trash pile ( I call it that because every bit of ad-
ministrative double—talk I got differed in fact) about WhlCl’l
I am speaking is the .little scuffle in front of the Student Un-
ion last Friday night. Some University students were
roughed up by some non—students, while the Campus Police
were nowhere to be found. A full report will be forthcoming

' in Friday's paper, but the point I would like to talk about is

the ,.attitude of the administration toward the situation
here on campus.

In the first place, they feel that by either hushing up the
incident on Friday or by ignoring it. the after-effects will
go away. It was for this reason that they made it virtually
impossible to have a factual story in this issue.

“We're sitting on a powder keg here,” I heard repeat-
ed several times. They feel that just because the assaultors _
on Friday were reported to have been local black high
school students, there is going to be some big reaction. By
whom, I wonder?

The real problem is the fact that the Campus Police
were not there to aid the students. The administration said _
there would be an investigation and that the security force

' would be improved in both quantity and quality in the fu-

ture. It probably will. and we may even get through the

4 next year with a minimum of incidents like those last Fri-

day. But what’s this "powder keg" attitude? This idea that
if The Pitt News doesn't publicize things. they won’t be-
come problems? '

In the first place. ask anyone who has placed any kind
of an annoucement in the paper how many people read it
from cover to cover? Not too many.’ Oh sure. we could
write unoffensive headlines, as one administrator suggest-
ed. But we’ve got to report it. If we have all the facts. it
makes reporting the true story much easier. This was one
of the major criticisms of the paper last year——that we
didn’t present the facts from both sides of the story. It's
hard when you get no cooperation from those that know
them all.

In the second place, it doesn’t-take a genius to look
around the campus and see that there are more black stu-
dents here this year than there were last year. But I have-
n’t seen any more racism (maybe even a little less in some
cases) than was present last year. And if there is going to
be trouble, it won’t be avoided by hushing things up.

This all brings us back to the kids and the pile of trash.

If we didn't have to play in the alley with old rags and
discarded bits of paper (in other words. if we had the

. facts) we could spend our. time working with something

constructive instead of looking for matches.

by SCOTT BAUM
President, Student Government

The students in this country, whether we ac-
knowledge it or not, are in a crisis situation. In
April of 1968, James Rector was killed at Berke-
ley, running from police, while participating in a
non-violent demonstration to save a patch of green
from being ‘ﬁconcretized. ” The demonstration follow-
ed a number of thwarted attempts to go through
channels of the University to save the park. When
15,000 some odd students marched on Sacra-
mento to protest the actions of the Alameda Coun-
ty Sherrif’s office, Reagan’s response to the press
about the march was “They didn’t tell me any-
thing.”

Police can come on to our campus and beat
us; state legislator’s can pass repressive laws ap-
plicable to us; the state can cut our funds at will;
and we have yet to acknowledge that we are in a
crisis situation.

This crisis cannot be dealt with by_Student
Governmentas we know it. Student Government
by definition is a creature of delegated author-
ity, essentially work handed to it by administra-
tions‘ that didn’t want to do the work. No new
power was created when Student Government was
begun, and the power still remains in the hands of
a stiff hierarchy-first the administration, then the
Chancellor, then the Board of Trustees, then the
State Legislature, and then finally the Governor.
Student Government’s power of decision making can
be cut at any one of these points and there is
nothing working withingthe structure that we can
do.

Power is only created when we move out of

“the structure and take action. The /force of the

action and the people acting and their ideas cre-

 

SGNot T... 

-var

ate the power. Thus Student Government is con-
strained by the structure it is committed to and can-
not create new power. Any form of dependence
on the administration for authority or for finances
or for anything else vitiates any power Student
Government may have and precludes students work-
ing with administrators as equals. .

Students are a class-a subculture. They are also
niggers. The question what do students want,
which is asked of me frequently by administra-
tors, faculty, and trustees is vaguely reminiscent
of the “what do these people want” line that
was common particularly during the civil rights
movement, and still is when people talk about
black peoples and their demands on white America.

What I want, and that's the only person I can
speak for, and what I think Student Government
should be dedicated to, is the creation of a max-
imum of “living space” at this institution, so that
people can determine what their goals and needs
are and fulfill them. So that they can create a life
style of their own and grow in any way they de-
sire. To avert stupid questions, that does not mean
that people can steal and kill when they feel up
to it. It means that they can structure their own
lives as they see fit, live as they are comfortable,
take the consequences for all their actions them-
selves, educational, social and political.

Student Government, now, cannot create that
living space. It cannot do what it promises every
year because it hasn’t the power to do it and
that must be acknowledged by the people it
“represents.” I can't do it, and will never be
able to, with our Student Government.

But more thinking and talking is still neces-

sary, there is more to be said; much more, and it
will be said.

Attention Freshmen! Are You:

-—1)Wondering if you’ll ever be
able to find your classes? Just
because the German Department
moved your German I class three
times.

——2) Thinking maybe you won’t
get through the course, even if
you find the class?

.—3) Worrying that you’ll never
get a correct invoice, an I.D. card,
and/or a valadation certifi-
cate? '

—-4) Etc., Etc., Etc.

Well, add one more to the
list — namely, what activities are
you going to join, now that you’re
here.

To help you decide, the Acti-
vities Fair on Monday and Tues-

day featured exhibits by a few
(i.e. very few) of the organiza-
tions on campus. You could have
joined the Chinese Language
and Cultural Club for tea or
watched the Annual American

other enthusiastic enterprises
were out to lunch. -

Other Side of the Grape Boycott

(Editor's Note: See Interview, page (5. )
by FRANK DON ATELLI

Very few issues of recent times have been
more important but less understood than the con-
troversy over California grapes. Important because
if successful in unionizing grape pickers, all agri-
cultural workers would be in danger of becoming

part of a closed shop union. Less understood be— 1

cause Cesar (Caesar?) Chavez and his United
Farm Workers Organizing Committee (UFWOC)
have succeeded in convincing clergy, housewives,
students, and store owners that he is the savior
of the grape workers. Under a smokescreen of half-
truths and fabrications, he has obsecured the real
issue of the struggle, namely compulsory union-
ism. ’

First, let us examine the “issues” of Chavez.

WAGES: The UFWOC claims that most of the
workers’ earnings are below the poverty line.
“Feed hungry children,” they urge. In truth, grape
pickers in California are the highest paid in the
country. The going base wage is $1.65 per hour
PLUS BONUSES. This is a misunderstood part of
the workers’ income. In addition to base pay,
workers receive 171/2 cents per box that they pack.
Fast pickers average eight or nine boxes per hour.

WORKING CONDITIONS: “Workers live in
squalid. poverty.” says a UFWOC handout. Cal-
ifornia farm workers, in truth. are covered by
more protective laws than farm workers in any
other state including: worl-:.man's compensation.

child labor laws, disability insurance. wage col-.

lection law. etc. The vast majority of the workers
live in spotless labor camps paid for by the grape
owners. An entire month's food will cost the work-
er only $30.00

MIGRANT WORKERS: According to one boy-
cotter: "TheMigrant farm system in the.United
States. and California in particular. is deplorable.
The Mexicans and blacks live in colonies . .  In
reality. nine out of ten grape pickers live in the
country they work in, and 73% have lived in the
same country for over 5 years. The official AFL-
CIO magazine. The Federalist, concedes that this is
“an almost totally domestic work force. “

STRIKE: All that can be said of the “massive
walkouts” claimed by Chavez is that they haven't

occurred. Over 5,000 grape pickers from the De-
lano area have been regularly picking grapes since
Cesar Chavez's was called.

After the smoke has cleared and Chavez’ ba-
loney has been ground, we come to the real issue
in the dispute ——- compulsory unionism. Indeed, the
reason a boycott has been promoted instead of
a strike by the grape workers themselves isbe-
cause the workers won’t co-operate. The very people
that Chavez seeks to dominate are the ones that
most sternly reject him. After three years of ef-
fort and the expenditure of $10 million, fewer
than two per cent of the California farm workers

A have joined UFWOC, a far cry from the 30 per

cent needed to force a union election. The farm
workers know the hazzards of unionism. They know
that after farm workers were unionized in Hawaii,
employment fell. by/50 per cent.

If the workers don’t support Chavez, and if the
growers don’t support Chavez, then where does
Cesar get help. His support comes from a variety
of sources for a variety of reasons. Organized la-
bor, more specifically the AFL-Cio and the United
Auto Workers (UAW), seeking ever to extend their
closed shop dictatorship, lavishly finance Chavez to
the tune of $120,000 per year. I

Support comes from other sources. Clergy have
fallen hook, line. and sinker. for Chavez. Organiza-
tions such as the Catholic Bishops of America solid-
ly endorse the boycott. Finally. the new left sees
eye to eye with Chavez. Their reasons are a mys-
tery. but then again, anything the new left does
now a days is a mystery.

And then there is one more reservoir of
support thegovernment. Having failed to con-
vince the workers with persuasion, Chavez is seek-
ing compulsory unionization by law. And here is
the crux of the controversy. Bill S.8, recently in-
troduced in the Senate. when stripped of its
flowery language. is designed to FORCE the grape
workers to join a union that they have voluntarily
rejected. Apparently, the sponsors of the bill
(Teddy, McCarthy, McGovern. Muskie. Javitz (a
Republican?). among others( feel that if the work-
ers don't know what's good for themselves. thev
will have to be told. Such is the plight of individ-
ualism in an increasingly collectivist society.

Conservative
Views Stated

By Pitt YAF

by JIM MARGITAN
Feature Editor

There’s a new organization on
campus. They believe in freedom
and student rights and are against
the draft and powerful Federal
government. They’re the Young
Americans for Freedom (YAF ). a
basically conservative group with
600 chapters and 55,000 members
nationwide.

Founded in 1960, the beliefs of
YAF are listed in ‘The Sharon
Statement." This statement lists
beliefs in political and economic
freedom, state rather than feder-
al government supremacy, and a
free economy. Since their found-
ing, they have been strongly
against the draft and in favor of a
volunteer army. To accomplish
this, they support the Goldwater
billi (S 503) rather than burning
draft cards, which, according to
Frank Donnatelli, Pitt chairman,
arouses Congressional anger and
actually hinders abolishment of
the draft. ,

Working together, YAF, Young
Republicans, and the SU Board
have succeeded in obtaining Wil-
liam F. Buckley, Jr., the well-
known conservative writer and
speaker, to give a lecture here on
Oct. 20. Donnatelli further ex-
plained, “We hope to be able to
have more conservative speakers
here and to even arrange debates
between the liberals and conser-
vatives. Our chief goal for this
year anyway is to engage in dia-
logue and to make ourselves
known on campus.”

He went on, “When many peo-
ple hear the word ‘conservative’
they think of us as a bunch of re-
actionaries supporting kings and
queens and empowers. This just
isn't so. We believe in our pres-
ent form of government. Further-
more, we have’ no connections
with the John Birch Society and we
don’t ‘purge members who don’t
agree with all our stands. Since
the advent of Wallacism, we seem
to be more and more of moderates.

Although they are activists,
they are against building take-
overs. In the event that such an in-
cident did shut down the Universi-
ty, Donnatelli explained the ac-
tion that YAF would take, “We
have had a battery of lawyers
working through the summer and
they have prepared legal briefs
that can be used to prosecute ei-
ther the students for violation of
civil rights or the University for
violation of contractual rights.
We hope it doesn‘t come to this.
but we’re ready if it does. It was
done at Penn State so we stand a
pretty good chance."

He also explains that YAF has
testified before many govern-
ment committees and is working
through these legislative chan-
nels to accomplish tl'ieir objec-
tives. Furthermore one—sixth of
the members of Congress are on
their advisory board. He feels that
this way they can get much more
done than by destroying buildings.

ll." there is any one quote to sum
up YAF"s opinion. it is their first
belief listed in the Sharon State-
ment. “We as young (ronserva
tivcs. believe that foremost
among the transcendent values is
the llldlVldUai'.\‘ use of his God-
given free will. whence derixes his
right to be free from the l‘(3_\'.[I‘l(.'-
Lions of arbitrary force. "

Free SUB Concerts

Saxons

by SHERRI ZIPPAY
Literary Editor

Somewhere along the folk-rock
spectrum. the Saxons (Dan Gog-
gin and Marvin Solleyi strike a
new vibration. The duo take con-
temporary songs and write some
of their own satires. presenting
them in a "modern baroque"
style.

The Saxons performed at a Stu-
dent Union Board free concert
Friday. They appeared at the Pitt
Coffee House last year. Combine
Marvin Solley‘s baritone and Dan
Goggin’s unique (and totally unex-
pected) three octave counter ten-
or, and add to this the unusual
sounds of a homemade harpsi-
chord and you have the basic ele-
ments of the Saxons.

“We try to make our material
informal without .making it too
folksy,” Dan said. “The college
circuit is the best for our type of
music.”

Vi-b rote

 

Dan Goggin and Marvin Solley, the Saxons.

. “We’re anti-war and anti-Nix-
on, but we’re not bitter,” Marvin
explained. “We try to cross the
gap between folk and classic mu-
sic.”

The Saxons write much of their
own music and experiment with
novel arrangements as well as
romantic ballads. One of their
pieces, “A Tribute to Lyndon
Johnson,” presents satire in the
form of an oratorio. complete

with strains from the “Hallelujah!

Chorus.”

Frosh To Scrimmage

Next Week-Quinter

by BILL NAAB
Coach Bill Quinter’s grid-iron Cubs are duplicating varsi-
ty procedures. Both the freshmen and the varsity teams have
been practicing on the same all-purpose fields, working on a power

offense.

Quinter appeared pleased with the present set-up. “They (the

control everything should work
out pretty well.”

The quarterbacks seem to have
found a real good target, any-
way. Sophomore Steve Moyer
has been catching passes like
there’s no such thing as an in-
completion.

“Moyer’s a well-disciplined
ball player, DePasqua assured,
indicating that he has been no-
ticing the rest of the squad, de-
spite the crowd of quarterbacks.”

Cubs) st.ill feel part of the team,
but are also working separately,”
he remarked. The squad met for
the first time on Thursday and
after three days of condition-
ing they are now learning the
basic fundamentals.

‘‘There’ll be more contact every-
day now,” said Quinter. He also
incicated that he is aiming to
shape the freshmen players into
a unit, unlike Cub squads of
the past. '

Simpson Sizes Up Job}.

by MARTHA HARTLE
Associate Sports Editor
With Carl DePasqua stressing ball control this fall, the of-
fensive line will be the key to much of the success or fail-
ure of the ground game. And as the unheralded members of
the offensive unit, the ‘linemen haveperhaps the most im-

posing job.

“Playing offensive line is not
too complicated, except in cer-
tain situations,” explains guard

John Simpson. You have to block ‘

differently for different defenses.
You have special blocks and you
really have to time your blocks
with the backfield so the back hits
the hole at the right time. You
have to coordinate line play with
the backs who will be cutting in
the hole.”

Simpson is one of the many
new faces on the offensive line
this season and although only a
sophomore, he is currently hold-
ing down a starting spot on the
line.
star, he’s big at 6’l”, 230, and
quick.

“My size is one reason I’m on
the offensive line,” he continued.
“Against the teams we play, you
need big linemen.” Although he

has good size, Simpson admits -

that he’ll have to go up against
much bigger defensive men.

“I’ll be playing across from
several All-Americans so I’ll
talk to the coaches and see how

I should block them. You have - A

to know something about a guy to
block him. If you’re not as strong,
you do things to compensate for

A highly touted all-Ohio.

Pass blocking is different from
blocking on a line play as well
“On a pass play, you usually
have to hold a block for four sec-
onds.. This gives you time for the
receivers to make their cuts and
for the quarterback to set-up.”

Simpson wasinjured last week,
but he says it’s only a slight in-
jury and he’ll be back in action
soon. With UCLA only ten days
away, he’s needed.

If you’re quick, you get on the
mark before him and if your
back can coordinate, a split—sec-
one block is long enough to let

“LeRoy”TeIIs New Yogi
  Group-—“No Ch

by I. PICKUM
The Yogi situation was becoming so deplorable that it was

even evident to Jerry “LeRoy”

Gruebel. Something had to be

done. and "LeRoy" knew that he was the man to do the some-

thing.

“Out! he yelled. And. of course. everyone of the unwanted left.

"First. Jacobs. Then. Lies. And, finally. the worst of them all—“Bubba”

Rosengarten, the guy who thought that he was the one who should be
telling others to leave because of his top ranking among the Yogis.

"I’n number one. now. and no-
body tries to argue. right?" Le-
Roy asked when he gathered the
new replacements for the upcom-
ing year. "Of course!" he an-
swered for them.

After a few moments of silence
Dave “GI” Tiernan decided to say
a few kind words about himself
and some slightly less complimen-
tary ones about the guy giving the
orders.

“Then, "GI” screamed, “What
kind of army is this? Talk about
unjust rule. Talk about no-vote de-
mocracy. Talk about unnecces-
sary wars? Talk abou . . 

The others walked into another
room and let “GI” discuss the war

 

strategy for this year’s Yogi sea-
son without a listener because as
"LeRoy" said, “If you argue,
you're out! "

Soon LeRoy recovered from the
shock of discovering that there
was someone who thought that he
could be wrong. “I am the one who
returned with the best record,
right?” LeRoy murmurred until
he finally decided that his troops
understood.

As soon as LeRoy left to go
somewhere the ‘trouble began,
without poor “LeRoy’s” know-
ledge.

gan to speak. “Let ‘LeRoy’ have
