_ Commends  
Student Demonstrators
For Conduct on Campus

Dr. George K, Brown, dean of student welfare of Car-
negie Tech commended University students who demonstrat-
ed on the Tech campus Monday morning for their orderly

“It was a very orderly crowd,” he stated. “The opera-
tional department here found no appreciable damage was

bad feelings on the part of Tech’s
student body. Everyone took the
demonstration in the spirit with
which it was made —' good clean
fun.”

Pitt students were barred from
entry at a few of the Tech build-

 ings, but Dr. Brown feels the stu-

dents considerately abided by the

7 restrictions.

Commenting on the organization

 

r _ti‘ck-. : «

of the rally, he stated, “I did
notice thatthere were a few fel-
lows wearing ‘P’ sweaters who
seemed to control the mob.”

However, Dr. Brown mentioned
one fault he considered as serious.
“My main concern was a young
man who drove his car
campus lawns, endangering the
student body of both campuses.L’_’

Dean of Students at the Uni-
versity, William Swartzbaugh and
police captain Charles Ray _re—
ported that_ there has been no
damages at the University that
can be linked t_o Monday’s demon-
stration.

Dr. John Geise, new vice chan-
cellor in charge of student affairs,
will decide who will pay the $120
bill charged for tlie use of. Soldiers
and Sailors Memorial Hall.

Robert Cleveland, president of
Carnegie Tech Student Congress
echoed the comments of Dr.
Brown. In his opinion nothing
negative will come out of "the ‘in-
vasion’ of Tec_h’s campus. Tech
students will not return the visit.

“I was quite impressed by the

spirit of the rally,’’ he remarked.
The display was ﬁne and deﬁnite-
ly in order because the_exciting
game played on Saturday war-
ranted it.”
» “There have been times in the
past when "such demonstrations
have gotten "out of order. I am

ledge n,o,harm was done to the

"I9 Trimster Ruslt  

The latest letter on the trimester ﬁlls us in on some of
the details, ‘but-vagaries and inequities still exist. .

In the ﬁrst place, the new plan under which ‘everyone
will meet on the trimester calendar next year discriminates
against undergraduate juniors, seniors, and whatever grad-
uate students are affected. \ ‘ »

It seems quite odd, also, th‘at"although the letter sent
to faculty members explicitly stated that all the schools
would have to make the adjustment to the. trimester calen-
dar, no such deﬁnite statement is possible concerning some
of the graduate and professional schools.

It certainly appeared, although not deﬁnitely stated last
Spring, that juniors and seniors in school year, 1959-60,
without the option of attending the third trimester, would
attend two normal semesters. ' , \

Now it seems that next year’s juniors and seniors will
have the disadvantages of the trimester plan without the
so—called advantages. For these people will be out of school
in April with no chan'ce,of taking the third trimester even
‘if thev so desire.‘ - .

iWhat would one do, out of school in April, planning to
continue schooling in September. Full—t.ime work opportuni-

ties are always very limited to that period of ‘the year for .

college students and they probably will do substantially
nothing.

_ As a matter of fact, since these students will not bereg- I
istered in school after the end of the “Winter” trimester in

April. it is doubtful that they can even take out books from
our library to spend some time proﬁtably.

The problems of faculty members still remain in the
new report. It continues to be'most illogical that a faculty
member makes an increase of only one-third in salary for
teaching‘ the third trimester, when he is performing one
and one—half times as much work. ‘. — =

' We have seen no mention of funds available for increas-
ed numbers of faculty members using the third trimester
for research. \ . ‘ 4

We have not seen any report on how student activities
will be handled during -next year’s third trimester. Will the
Pitt News publish without any junior or senior staff mem-
bers? Will the Debate‘ Union meet "without their executive
committee of predominantly junior-‘sor seniors?

Will there be any student government, not that it Ihakes
too much difference as things stand now? ,

Answers to these and many other pressing problems
should be forthcoming _infthe._very near future. It again ap-
-pearsthat we are rushingfiinto a trimester program still

without the proper groundwork. «

Opportunist _At- Work

   

., ‘ T

Tricky Dick Ont TheA4arc|1

By Millard Amdur

Vice President.Richard Nixon is quite a sauve
and talented politician. Unfortunately, Mr. Nixon
is still “an_opportunist who works both sides of
the street,” as Nation Magazine recently termed
him. _

The Vice President in his appearances during
the -campaign was quite solici-
tous“ to the voters. He told the
people at that time that they
should be acquainted with every
facet of foreign policy.

He concluded with words
preserved by the press. for. ‘pos-
terity to ponder (and they will),
“Therefore the people are en-
titled to know where their re-  ‘ ‘ .

spective representatives -in Congress,‘and particu-" \

larly their representatives in the Senate, stand on
any parts of our foreign policy which are. in
controversy.”

This took collosal gall and assumed a naivete
of the public unparalleled in‘U.S. history. It is not
that what he said during "the campaign is not
good policy, it "is merely not Mr. Nixon’s _policy
as demonstrated by his cries ,a few weeks previous.

When the information leaked out that letters
to the White, House were running four to one

against the Administration policy on Quemoy,

Nixon, intimatedat the time that the voters were
not sufficiently well—informed to deal ‘with such
matters‘. ‘ '

Mired in Mud . , .

If they were .not, we, might ask the smooth
Mr. Nixon, who is to blame? “Herblock,’i’ the
noted cartoonist, recently pictured Nixon mired

in mud with the caption reading something like ‘

“It’ll be different‘ when I’m number one man.”
Let’s hope the U.S. never has to ﬁnd out how dif-
ferent it would be? ‘

Blood, Man, Blood

The War Craze

By Joseph Ungar
Radioactive fallout, a note-
worthy creation, is something
understood by few, feared by
many. and discussed by almost

 

store news stand carries a full
barrage of so—called men’s mag-
azines which reek with
War II gore. And the very num-
ber of these magazines attests

The November 13 edition of the Reporter Maga-
zine features'an_article entitled “Nixon for Nixon,”
which presents another side of the Vice President,
the public relations veneer, very important to the
successful politician of today.

It seems that Nixon tries to get quite chummy
with the press crowd. He deals familiarly with
press problems and often tells members of the
press (‘Keep asking me that question,_I’ll try to
play no favorites.” -

Reporter Cater claims that the veep uncon-
sciously falls into “the lingo of the publicity boys,”
For instance, he always_refer‘s to his speaking en-
gagements as “appearances,” typically a press

word.
In talking about rival Rockefeller, Nixon with
great sincerity claims, “All of us current national
ﬁgures will be helped by developing other national
ﬁgures.” ' ‘

Hard Role vs. Soft Sell ' ‘

Nixon often gears his speeches to the audience

involved (sometimes even contradicts himself). "

To the lunch hour crowd in Hartford Connecticut,
he played the hard role, “I’l1 rest my case on this,
If you agree that the three propositions I am going
to lay down represent your position . . .”

To a high school crowd, the soft sell, calm and
digniﬁed. When he speaks to outdoor amphitheater
audiences, “all stops are pulled.” One illustration,
even better words to tell you what I think about
it.”

» The press has one device that is used at all
times with Nixon, “the minifon,” (a small -re-
corder), In the past, there has been much bicker-

ing over what Nixon did or did not say. ‘

And so we have the picture of the_ sly oppor-
tunist, now setting his sights quietly b’u’t efﬁciently
toward 1960..Watch his statements, his antics, his
stylistic perfection. He might be our next President.

It is a type

than the atomic variety. Itarises
from no speciﬁc weapon, rather
from,-the presence and personal-

ity of all weapons and" military »

elements in general. It arises in

a complex wayfrom our con— .

stant preoccupation with the
possibility of’_and preparation
V for war. ' ’

Before going further, one must

emphasize that this is, to be sure,
a vital‘preoccupation. After all,
e the Russian threat is not imag-
inary. '
‘ But it is, nevertheless, a pre-
occupation'that should be seen
in its proper perspective-—not as_

something grand and glorious but ‘
_as a necessary “evil”. And here ‘

is the point.

The concept of war, due to its ,_

unfortunately prominent ‘position
in«modern society, often smacks
more of popularity than of deg-
redation. For in many ways we
are using war to entertain our-
selves.
Gung-ho Battles
Hardly a month goes by with-
out the appearance of a new
“gung-ho” screen thriller. The
latest is called “Tarawa Beach-
head”. According to ‘billings, it
depicts “the bloodiest battle the
US.‘ Marines ever fought”. A
great attraction. Come to our

to their popularity.

The cover illustrations typical-
ly show some tough machine-
gunner who stands at the edge
of a foxhole with bleeding

cheecks and gnashing teeth and_

ﬁres into an advancing troup of
sinister Japanese.‘ The picture is
‘well - established;
changes. ‘ ‘

Some of the headline features
from a random sampling of this
month’s virile supply———“Blood-
bath on the Dunes of Death”,
“Bloodbath on Mindanao”, “The
Bloody Battle With Japs an_d
Crocodiles at Tenaru”.

Rugged Toys ,

Even certain children’s toys
are becoming ‘grossly effected.
Department stores carry all
kinds of bold plastic replicas,
from a “Sensational Remco Bull-
dog Tank”, which brandishes a
foot long rocket—launcher and
ﬁres shells, to a rugged, self-
propelled Howitzer consisting of
138 parts and a miniature com-
bat crew of six. In an expanding

It was sort of tragic to hear

_passage in “The Long March”,

1 Travels to Nebraska

Ditka, Plowman to Start Against Huskers;
F B Tossup Between Cunningham, Riddle
By LARRY HAGGERTY. § _

The bowl-seeking Panthers of John Michelosen Wlll put
their»New. Year’s Day aspirations right on the line when they
meet Nebraska tomorrow at Memorial Stadium 1n'.L1nc01n.
A crowd of 25,000 will be on handfor the 3 p.m., Plttsbllrgh

time, kickoff.

It will belthe ﬁfth road trip

date. Currently they are only 50-
50 on foreign ﬁelds, losing to Syr-
acuse and Michigan State and de-
feating UCLA and Minnesota.
Oddsmakers have made the Panth-
ers a lopsided 22-point favorite to
gain their sixth win of the season.

Thus far Skyscraper U. has Yet
to lose*‘~a game at Lincoln although
the Panthers played in scoreless
ties in 1928, 1930, and 1932. The

i Jungle Cats captured last year’s

 

. cuse,

tiltat the Stadium 34:-O.
One Upset Only ‘

~Nebraska upset, Penn State in
their opener, 14-7, but has found‘
the going tough in the last few
games. The Cornhuskers possess
a 2-6 record. Their other winlwas
over Iowa State while losses were
to Purdue, Kansas State, Syra-
Colorado, Missouri,. and
Kansas.

Nevertheless, Michelosen isn’t
taking the game lightly. “It’s al-
ways tough towvin in Lincoln,”
Michelosen said. ‘‘I don’t care
what anybody says, I know that
for a fact.”

The Jungle Cats came out of
the Notre Dame game in good
physical shape. End Art Gob, who
was taken to Mercy Hospital for
observation, is expected to play
on Saturday. The only doubtful
‘player is Fullback Bob Stark, who
was hurt at Michigan State and
has missed the -last four games.

Soph Takes Over

Stark‘s spot on the second unit
has been handled by Sophomore
Jim Cunningham. Cunningham
was one of the surprise starters
in the Notre Dame game when
Fred Riddle came up with a slight
sprained ankle.

Besides throwing the key

« block which enabled Bill Kali-
den to score the winning touch-
_ down in the last eleven seconds,
"the 5-foot ll-inch, 205-pounder
from‘ Connellsville gained 35
yards on ten carries and caught

’"—‘’one. pass for seven yards.

“He likes to play,” declared

:.XBackﬁeld Coach Vic Fusia. “He

has the power and good speed and
will play"more and more.” For the
season Cunningham has gained 60
yards on 20 attempts, grabbed two
passes for 32 yards, one a touch-
down reception, and returned two
punts 48 yards. '
To Start Again"
For the second straight week

for the Blue and Gold it to

Michelosen will start Mike Ditka
at left end and Curt Plowman
at right. halfback. The starting
position at fullback is a tossup at
the moment between Riddle and
Cunningham. ‘ ,

If Gob doesn’t start, his posi-
tion in the’lineup at right end
will be held down by either Joe
Pullekines or Ron Delﬁne. Other
starters will be Tackles Ken
Montanari .and Bill Lindner,
John Guzik and Ed Michaels at
the guards, while the. center slot
will be taken care ofrby Don
Grafton.

Rounding. out the backﬁeld will
be left Halfback Dick Haley and
either Ivan Toncic or Kaliden at.
quarterback. Toncic may not start
since he has been hampered by a
stiff neck lately.

Eight-game statistics show that
Riddle and‘ Haley lead the ground
gainers with 256 and 234,yards,

respectively. Toncic leads the pas-

sers with a .631 percentage while
Ditka has caught 12 passes to lead
there. Haley leads in scoring with
32 points.

F orIC4A Run
In Nl/Monday

The cross country team will

make its last appearance of the _

1958 season when they travel to
New York for the ICAAAACcham-
pionships on Monday. C
The harriers, who made a strong
showing last week as they came
through to down New York Uni-
versity, 22-38, will be trying for
a performance like that in the
1955 IC4A meet. In that season,’
under coach Carl Olsen, who is
retiring in February, the "Panthers
won their ﬁrsttitle since 1924.
The meet will, as usual, be
run over the ‘Van Courtland
course. The harriers will leave
today and practice on the" course
Saturday. , .
The harriers "will be counting
heavily upon‘ the performance of
Ron Rush. Rush who placed sec-
ond in last Saturday’s meet against
NYU will be the harriers biggest
threat.

With only two games remaining
on the schedule the Panther boot-

Victory in nine attempts Saturd_ay,

Thetas Drop One
To Brackenridge,
In Quarter F inals

Another close game in the wo-
men’s volleyball tournament was
seen in the quarter ﬁnals as
Brackenridge came. through to
beat Kappa Alpha Theta, 23-2,2.

Brackenridge, an independent
team composed of girls living at
at the women’s dorms, was led by
their captain, Sue Hills. Lori Leh-
ner captained the losing Thetas.

‘Delta Zeta forfeited their game
to Chi Omega, iwhich puts
the Omegas in the semi-ﬁnals of
the consolation tournament. Their
opponent in that game which will
be played Tuesday, Nov. 18 will

be the Cheri Amies, an indepen-

and Gold are fresh off their 2-0
shutout victory over Ohio State.
Scoring the two goals for the
Panthers last Saturday were Bob
McNulty, his ﬁrst point of the sea-
son, and Bob Murdock, his second.
This will be theﬁrst meeting
between the Panthers and the
Bob Cats from Ohio U. A win
for the Blue and Gold would
insure the Panthers of tying
their worst season record which
was 1956 when they won only
three games.

The “scoreless” Panthers were
ﬁnally able "to put some punch
into the offensive line last Satur-
day; and if they can continue to
improve they will havean excel-
lent chance to turn a dismal sea-
son into a just under .500 one.

Only Two Games
Keep Yogis From
Complete Accord P

The only thing that could be
heard in the Yogi den last night
was the roaring laughter of
those inimitable prognosticators.
They were having a jolly good
time, and why not? For once
they are in almost complete
agreement, disagreeing on only
two games, Duke-Wake Forest
and Penn-Columbia.

They must be cautioned, how-
ever. Hearsay has it that a con-
ple of the Yagae made their se-
lections this week under new
methods. - Now maybe they’re
picking them as to the number
of cavities each team’s players
have in their animal mouths.

for the Women’s Volleyball Team.
