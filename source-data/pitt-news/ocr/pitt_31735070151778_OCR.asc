Pitt Computing Services can only offer free
tablets and inﬂatable obstacle courses once
a year, but the new technology proﬁled at
Wednesday’s Love Your Computer kickoff
event is available year—round. I

- This year’s event promoted several new
technologies and service locations avail-

student computing services, said the event
was “aimed toward informing new students
about Computing Services.”

This year, Rhoades said, students should
not need to carry ﬂash drives ever again.
Instead, Pitt students can utilize 25 GB of
online storage space accessible from any-
where with an Internet connection. Box, at

Students engage with veterans and anniversaryof Sept. 11

Raechelle Landers
Staff Writer

Andrew Cunningham felt honored to
kick back with U.S. veterans for the first-
ever Sept. 11 Memorial organized by Pitt
students and the Southwestern Veterans’
Center. V

“It’s’one thing tolsalute before a ﬂag V

and meditate in prayer for the thanks
and well—being of our veterans, and it’s
another thing to actually meet them and
convey this gratitude,” Cunningham said.

Cunningham, a junior philosophy and
history major, said that he was especial-
ly-touched by a veteran who expressed
overwhelming gratitude at how often he

. menced at 2:15 .p.m.

is recognized for his time in the military.
In honor of the 12th anniversary of
Sept. 11, a group of about 20 students cel-
ebrated a memorial event organized by
the Student Civic Engagement Council.
The council organized the event ifrcoop-.
eration with veterans’ center Volunteer
Coordinatorljohn Ayers. The students
traveled to the Southwestern Veterans’
Center, located near Highland Park, at
1 p.m. to play games with residents and
participate inthe memorial service.
Students sat with the veterans as they
played bingo, helping them fill: their
cards asithe vets collected a dollar for
every win. The memorial service com-

~ “I think everyone shed a fewtearsl

.when some of the veterans were giving

their testimonials,” said Mona Kazour,
co-director of the Student Civic Engage-
ment Council. .‘ _ V
Rich Adams, commandant‘ of the
Pennsylvania Department of Military and
Veteran Affairs, welcomed the audience
to the posting of the colors, a military
tradition. Adams then introduced the
Westview VFW 2754,color guard. Gospel
singer DeNese Booker performed ‘:The
Star-Spangled Banner,” adding another

, note of patriotism to the ceremony.

Cunningham said that he viewed the
ceremony as a way to express gratitude

I to the veterans on behalf of a larger com-

munity. b _
“I wanted to honor them by being

there, to showthem that Pitt, the com-“

munity and Americans everywhere are

_ blessed to have such heroes,” said Cun- .

ningham. ' _

Dylan Nestor, a junior chemical'en-
gineering major at P_itt,_~said that he at-
tended the event to honorthe victims
of Sept. 11. ' v .

After hours of swapping stories with V
the veterans, students indulged in des- .
jserts at the conclusion of the service. '

“It was the first time the -site had ’

done anything to remember 9/11,” Ka-
zour said. “Maybe it’ll be a tradition for
the future.” I

’ ‘ noff recalled, he decided to compile video

r

snippets about comments on Israel.

“Israel was on my mind, and I felt so
bad. Everyone’s always beating her up '—_ '
my poorlsrael,” he said. ‘

After Nesenoff’s son had ‘managed to
receive press passes for both to attend
the May 2o10Jewish Heritage Day at the
White House, Nesenoff decided that it '
would be a good place to ask for comments

a about Israel.

In addition to the high-proﬁle political
ﬁgures they saw during their visit, includ—‘
ing Bill Clinton and Joe Biden, Nesenoff
recognized journalist Helen Thomas.

Taking the opportunity to begin his
project, Nesenoff asked Thomas on cam-
era if she had any comments on Israel, to
which she responded, “Tell them to get
the hell out of Palestine.”

~ Nesenoff said that he knew he had to
do something with the controversial state-
ment that he had just recorded.

“I thought I should do something with
it, put it online,’? he said.

CHANCELLOR

phen Tritch said the diversity in professional
experience among the members of the Chan-
cellor Search Committee “will be a valuable
asset in the ongoing search.” '

Thus far, Tritch has been communicating-

with the University community through writ-

- ten updates, according to Pitt spokesperson

Ken Service. With the addition of a website
devoted to the chancellor search, students
can learn more about each of the commit-
tee members, as well as other information
relevant to the search. _

However, the names of potential contend-
ers‘ will be kept quiet, according to Service.

“Mr. Tritch has explained on two occa-
sions that ‘the need for conﬁdentiality for
the candidates is essential to attracting the
very best candidates,” Service said. V

Tritch also announced the scheduling of
14 search forums, which will be held at Pitt,
the University’s four branch campuses and in
cities across the country. The ﬁrst forum will
be held on Sept. 18 at 3 p.m. in the William

Pitt Union Assembly Room, where public can »

provide their own insight into the search.

History always remembers its great

In November, two candidates

tower in the history of New York
City as one of the mostdynamic the
metropolis has ever seen. Between
extensive building projects foraris—
ing population and a campaign to
ban oversized soft drinks, hehas at-
tracted ample praise and criticism.

But as New York loses its vet-
eran mayor, Pittsburgh will gain a
fresh one in Bill Peduto. To improve
the city, Peduto must learn from
Bloomberg’s greatest successes —
and greatest mistakes. Speciﬁcally,
he should follow in Bloomberg’s
steps toward sustainability with
the construction of a better bicycle
infrastructure. At the same time,
however, he must be careﬁil‘ not to
allow the types of uncontrollable
construction that have led to the

At ﬁrst glance, New York and

' Pittsburgh shareveryfewcommon- ‘

alities. New York City’s gargantuan
population of 8.3 million dwarfs

-Pittsburgh’s intimate 306,211. But b

beneath the drastically differing

‘ skylines, both share a similar story

of deterioration andvregeneration.
Beginning in the 19705, employers
in both cities ﬂed en masse, taking

much of the population with them. ,
-Starting inthe 1990s, however, both
A cities have rebounded by attracting

investment and young profession-
als to drive a 21st-century service
economy. ’ e _

It is only ﬁtting, then, that the
only mayor New York City has
elected in thisvmillennium should
become the poster child forthis'sto-

' ry of urban redevelopment, which
is afamiliar one to cities across the _

United States. ' -

The mayor of Pittsburgh could
begin by reading Bloomberg’s
construction craze asfa caution-
ary tale. Although the latter over-
saw the construction, of 40,000
new buildings in the city during
his term, he also saw low—income

  

Y communities squeezed out of their
neighborhoods bylthe associated
cost increases.

. Nowhere was this more clear
than in Williamsburg, a Brooklyn
neighborhood once home to low-
income families and artists thatwas
transformed into upscale housing
and waterfront space after extensive

r rezoning. This gentriﬁcationforced
residents —— many of whom had
economic and familial roots in the
area —— out of Williamsburg and its
surrounding neighborhoods.

Rezoning and construction to
, attract higher spending and higher-
income residents became the hall-

marks of the‘Bloomberg adminis— .
\ tration’s attitude toward housing.

One canonly hope that itwill notbe
so for our next mayor of Pittsburgh.
This is especially pressingforthe
Steel City, ‘considering the parallel
trends in housing price and poten-

fatter paychecks from successﬁil ﬁrms.
The loss of Pittsburgh’s characteristically
low cost of living threatens much of what
makes thecity appealing. Affordable rents
enable the city to not only attract sizable ar-
tistic and student populations but also en-
able those residents to live side—by-side with
low—income families, in neighborhoods such
as Lawrenceville and East Liberty. _

A higher cost of living means a less at-

      

tractive city to these valuable populations, -

and less livable neighborhoods for working

families.
Peduto, unlike Bloomberg, must realize

the economic possibilities available to a city ’

that actively maintains low—cost housing.
Rather than rezoning low-income hous-
ing and offering unsuccessﬁil incentives
for developers to maintain affordable units
-5 which Bloomberg unsuccessfully irnple—
mented — the mayor must actively pursue
more units zoned for low—rent properties.
Relying on the market to maintain the cost of
living that made Pittsburgh an econorriically
viable location proves simply unsustainable.

For sustainable ways to attract and.main- .

tain investment and interest, however, Peduto

would be wise to take a page from Bloom—
berg’s book.

Bloomberg’s extensive bike—lane construc-
tion and creative bike—sharing programs both
garnered wide acclaim and present a sustain-
able solution, in every sense of the word.

Despite vocal opposition, Bloomberg
managed to increase bicycle use among New
Yorkers by 225 percent by expanding the
bicycle infrastructure to a record—breaking
500 miles. _

VIfPedut'o wants to maintain the educated,
dynamic population within the Pittsburgh
city limits — rather than losing them to the
surrounding Allegheny County suburbs -

bike lanes present themselves as affordable
and safe alternatives to a car—dependent sub-
urban lifestyle. A

Not only could this help relieve the city of
its many public-transportation and parking
woes, but it also happens to be pretty good
for the environment.

Clearly, the problems — and solutions —
that present themselves to New York City are
common to countless American cities, and
Pittsburgh is no exception.

We can only hope, however, that the future
mayor of Pittsburgh won’t count 24—ounce
pop containers among those problems.

Stajj’ Writer

There are parts of western Ireland that are
stunningly beautiful, attracting the atten-
tion of tourists from around the world.
Connemara is one of those exquisitely
mystifying areas. ’ I
But for the year-round residents of such
place — where economic opportunities are
scarce and the granite—riddled land makes
farming apainfully difﬁcult task —— the loca-
tion paints a much different picture.
These are the circumstances that in-

spired Martin McDonagh’s “A Skull in ’

Connemara,” a perversely dark comedy to
be presented by the Pittsburgh Irish and
Classical Theatre. The show will run from
Sept. 12 to 28 at the Charity Randall Theatre
in Oakland. A

' “The play’s roots are based in a kind of

poverty and also a kind of communal village

spirit,” Alan Stanford, producing artistic

director of the Pittsburgh Irish and Clas—
sical Theatre, said. According to‘Stanford,
the region’s poverty is also the source of
its people’s resilience. “The people are as
rugged and as tough and as relentless as
the landscape they live in.”

The play’s story revolves around a local

gravedigger named Mick Dowd — played '

by actorjames I_<eegan,— who is_ forced to
disinter the bones of his deceased wife. Ru-
mors resurface about Dowd’s culpability in

her death, causing calamity to ensue within

the small village.
, “Everybody is sort of watching your
business, and you are the news, whatever

is happening in your life,” Keegan said in

regard to the villagers portrayed in the play.
In a place as sparsely populated as
Connemara, people can be very-blunt about

McDo'nagh’:s play features nﬁif ,

their suspicions. “There is a-kirld of will-
ingness inthe Irish character to take other
Irishmen to task for who they"are and what
'they’ve done,” said Keegan.
“There is a kind. of vengefulness and, at ‘

times, a pettiness.” . y . ’ ‘A

T McDonagh’s play captures that phenom-
enon, properly blendingthe modern with a

: traditional Irish representation. The play-

wright is no stranger to morbid comedy

' —.—‘ onthe contrary, he thrives on it. Though

many may«§not recognize the playwright’s
name, his work directing and writing the
award—winning ﬁlm “In Bruges” helped
him gain notoriety as one of the premiere
masters of bitterly dark humor, managing
to balance wit and grit with ease. '
“ [A Skull in Connemara] has this beauti-
ful style, but it also has this sort of nastiness
and casualness of common people in a con-
temporary setting,” Martin Giles, director '

or PICAT“

M raéters. Photo Co

‘A Skull in Connemara’ displayswest |reland’s dark humor  

of the play, said. Giles prais'esMcDonagh for
portraying characters with an “unﬁltered
lens,” seeing them forwho they are — their
faults on full display.

Although the play takes on a serious mat-
ter, it is still a comedy — and a dark comedy
at that. But in thewords of Stanford, “All
comedy is dark,” because we rarely laugh

' at ourselves." “We laugh at other people,”

he said, before adding: “Because they are
in trouble.”

As the ‘story unfolds, Giles said the char— I

actérs are seen as both “incredibly stupid”
and “incredibly articulate — in a lot of ways
like Shakespeare clowns.” This feature is one
of the ways thatM.cDonaghpaints a picture

REVIEW

Pittsburgh rocker Nic Lawless
shows off his polish, versatility

  on newest release

Shawn Cooke
F or The Pitt News

Nic Lawless and His 

 Young Criminales
L Sunless
_ Grade: B

A name like N ic Lawless can evoke a dan-

« gerous brand of listener expectations.

Harkening back to a_ time when punk
implied serious troublemaking, a sen-
sational alias may raise a few eyebrows

within the now hyper—image-conscious

scene. Such is the case with Mr. Lawless.
However, on Sunless, Lawless shows

_ that he is capable of far more than some

old-school punk hellraising. While the
name works to reﬂect his erratic stage
presence, it does little to convey the
smooth versatility displayed on the band’s
ﬁrst full—length album. Throughout the
album, the Pitt student briskly transi-
tions between dirty garage punk and
old—fashioned surf pop, often blending
the two subgenres into a familiar, infec-
tious sound. b

On his self-titled debut EP, Lawless
specializedin ultra-fuzzy lo—ﬁ with nearly
unintelligible lyrics. Delightfully messy,
the songs felt like they were banged out
in the smallest basement or garage imag-
inable. Tinges of the sunny garage punk
found on Sunless were present back then,
but the evolution is undeniable. Cleaner,
leaner and more thoroughly polished, the
songs on Sunless sizzle and punch with a

stark increase in production value. Two

tracks —- “911” and “Hi Way” —— appear
on both releases, yet bear little sonic re-
semblance. The searing distortion" and
muted sneer from the Nic Lawless EP has
been replaced with a far more streamlined
vocal and instrumental track that would

album. p S - .

Not coincidentally, Lawless cites Ju-
lian Casablancas as a primary inﬂuence,
along with Iggy Pop and The Velvet Un-

' derground. He proudly exhibits stylistic
tics from each artist throughout the re— .

lease, yet they sometimes feel awkwardly
isolated. The album’s front half features
some of the more glaring homages to Law-
less’ inﬂuences. Not only does “9‘11” fea-
ture some signature Casablancas moans
and croons, but it also displays the catchy
and taut guitar riff-work associated with,
well, every Strokes song ever. On the next
track, “LoVe Like Death,” Lawless and
the Criminales give their best Iggy and
the Stooges impression, complete with
howls, screams, and a barreling guitar
line. As a garage punk rock band in 2013,
it’s nearly impossible to maintain any
degree of originality. However, a shape-
shifting track-by—track commitment to
various rock archetypes can prove to be

Thinking of skipping leg

-Strengthening your legs will payoff long term. Ben Brownlee | Staff Photographer

Katie Martin
For The Pitt News

In the ﬁtness community, there is a_run—

ning joke: If you have skinny legs, you’ve
deﬁnitely been skipping out on leg day.

In fact, many gym goers seem to avoid

it like the plague. People, (mostly men),
run around thetgym with enormous up-
per body muscles," yet they have legs like
Spongebob Squarepants. Often called
chicken legs, you’ll ﬁnd them anywhere

vtherefs a gym. . :

Why are they skippinglout on leg day?
Dom.Mazzetti, You'i‘ube celebrity and
broscience master, puts it best: “Leg
day is the worst. It’s hard, it’s painful
and it’s not arms, or chest, or shoulders
or even back. You’re probably still sore
from your last leg workout, which was
your first leg workout.... And your last
leg workout.” ’ '
Don’t let-thishappen to you." _
Ou-t of the hundreds of muscles in

the human body, the’ legs, which include"-

the gluteus rnaximus, quadriceps and
hamstring muscle groups, are some of
the strongest. They make up the power-

      day? Thinkagain

 

generating center for running, jumping, .

walking, Olympic lifting, power lifting
and virtually any activity you perform
in everyday life.

If you were to try andpipick up one end
of a couch or table using only your arms
and back, the possibility of injury is high
because those muscles aren’t as strong.
But by engaging your hamstrings and

_ the rest of the posterior chain, you can

lift that couch and not have to _hobble
around like you’re 81. Your gluteus maxi-
muis, more commonly known as your
butt, is the largestmuscle in the body.
Along with your hamstrings, your glutes
are primarily responsible forholding

the rest of your massive frame upright,

and erect. '

Erica Dobos, Olympic Lifting coach
at CrossFit Shadyside, says that without
proper leg strength, attempting either of

the two Olympic lifts —— either a “snatch”
4 or a “clean and jerk” — can be a disaster.

“What I’ve noticed in people who
don’t have good lower—back or leg
strength is that they collapse forward

Live and let die: Whylwe  
don’t I need International
Cassette Store Day d

I John Lavanga
A€°3’E Editor

Last Saturday was International Cassette
Store Day.,I know this not because I hap-
pened to speak to someone who was ex-

cited about Cassette Store Day, nor because i

I participated in Cassette Store Day, nor
because I intentionally run a dragnet across
the depths of reddit looking for things that
I might ﬁnd to belentirely irrelevant (I’d
probably discover somethingifar more in-

» teresting and possibly more disturbing if

I went that route). Though I hold a large,
warm place in my heart for dead and dying
mediums —— I’m writing for a newspaper, £6:
god’s sake —— even I can’t bring myself to
embrace the cassette tape so readily.

I know that Saturday was International 0

Cassette Store Day because of my addiction
to petty, useless online news. And in the
lead up to Cassette Store Day, g_,ews«outlets
from across the web began to put together
articles all centeredon’ the return of the
compact cassette. Topped with predictable
question titles like “Can cassette tapes be

' cool again?” or “Why would anyone buy

a cassette tape?” These articles appear to
delve into a strange alternate realitywhere,
to quote Mark Coleman’s piece on CNN.
com, “there’s a sizable, and growing, subset
of consumers who lust for musical objects
that they can hold in their hands (and their
hearts), as well as their ears,” and this subset
decided that the cassette tape — with its
poor sound quality, variance in playback
speed and all of the other frustrations that
come with it — was the best bang for their
nostalgic buck. I N .

I understand the appeal of such articles.
It’s nice to drum up a story taking a quick
trip‘ down memory lane. It’s fascinating to

explore the music medium of an era and -

how it deﬁned theirpop culture. The mix
tape as a symbol of budding ’8os love is
pretty adorable, and there’s no harm in a
little reminiscing. However, the time of the

I cassette tape is past, and I think we’d all.be

better off if we just let that old medium rot

, in its shallow, unmarked grave. ‘

Let us assume for a moment that all of
these articles are on to something. Rumors
of the cassette" tape’s death 'have'been greatly

exaggerated. The growing throngs ofvinyl .

collectors around /the country are  to

eagerly drop theirsearch fora mintrjelease ’

of Bruce, Springsteen’s “Greetings from As-

bury Park, N.J.,’7 and will instead their

focus to_7get_ting their hands on thefcassette
version;of“TunnellofLove.”All willihail the
cassette, and the local hipster population
will take tostrutting up and down the street
with old walkmans they stole from their
parents’ garages.‘ For anyone who harbors
a deep love of music, there arefew things
that could be worse than this;

What must be kept in mind when the
cassette tape is discussed is that, while vinyl

records have always held a special placeinl
 the hearts of millions, no one ever really fell
_ in love with the cassette tape. Vinyl records

came with beautiful album art and boasted

sound quality that still makes modern au— ,

diophiles swoon. Cassette tapes came in
ﬂimsy plastic packaging and ﬂattened out
the nuances of the music. Different cassette

players would play at different speeds. Some V

would eat your tapes. But cassettes stuck

around, not because they were well liked, '

but because they were cheap, accessible and
egalitarian. It’s no easy task to press your

down vinyl, but compiling a mix tape was an .

innovative process of sharing music that
rewrote the rules and put power in the hands
of the consumer in an entirely new way.

In the classic music—geek ﬂick “High Fi-
delity,”John Cusack, who lives in the year
2000, discusses the art ofrnaking a mix tape
at length. But he owns a record store and it’s
made apparent that the true magic of music
can be found on vinyl. The only tapes in
sight are the ones he plans to turn into mix’
tapes and a homemade recordingby a punk
duo. It’s a great way _to highlight the role of

Ballroom of the Union.)

205 pounds for countless reps but can’t
lift one end of a sofa, it doesn’t seem like
your fitness is very functional.
Perhaps the aversion to leg day is
because of aesthetics. If you take a look
at trending male celebrities_like Liam
Hemsworth or Ryan Reynolds, they all
seem to have several things in common:
rock hard abs and the chiseled pecs of a
god._]acob Hughes, a 2012 Pitt graduate,
said that people like to work harder on

the parts of their bodies that people see.

“I feel like a lot of it comes, down to
the fact that not many people see your
legs in the course of the day, and work-

. ing your upper body allows you to show

off that work. I also think that people

correlate big biceps with being strong, ‘
which can be the case, but I personally

have friends with bigger chests and arms
than I do, who I can still out-lift because
I have stronger legs.” ' '

But it’s not only theimefn who miss '

out on leg day. Women do, too.

‘:Girls skip it because they most like- -
ly don’t know what exercises todo, or
because they don’t want to havebulky .

legs,” says Dobos.
But that seems to be changing. There’s
a movement in the women’s health and
ﬁtness community driven by the mantra
“Strong ismthe New Skinny,” which is
determined to change the stereotype
that women must be thin to be attractive.
, Hailing from Iron Sport Gym in Gle-
nolden, ,Pa., Dana Rygwelski is ranked
6th in the nation in her class of female
lifters in the squat.,In her opinion, what

people don’t understand is that the ben-

efits of lower body exercises, especially
squatting, extend beyond your butt;
quads, and hamstrings. 1
“Your legs are your foundation and
your ass is the engine fo_r everything.
But what they don’t know ‘is that by

squatting, you will also addlmuscle and"

definition to your back and arms,” she
said in an email. '

In fact, the squat, one of the most
fundamental movements in life (think
aboutltow you sit into a chair), should
bethe first addition to any leg workout.
Done often enough, this movement can
dramatically increase your leg strength.

_ So, make this week count: Squat heavy,
squat often and. squat properly. Grab ‘a a

buddy and head up to the Pete._ After

all, friends don’t let friends skip leg day.

exhausting for theduration of an album.
Luckily, Nic Lawless and His Young
Criminales conﬁdently swagger into the

1 album’s second half with their catchi-

est and most self-assured tracks. Brim-
ming with ideas, the album’s midsection
contains some genuinely exciting garage
punk _— not just “for a Pittsburgh band,”

but for a band from any of the nation’s
major indie hubs. The album’s title track g

stands out as a deﬁnitive turning point,
cranking the collective energy up to 11.
Lawless howls and wails similarly to pre-
vious tracks, but with a conviction and
style that is solely his own. Though “Sun—
less” and “Black Girls” only amount to
two and a halfiminutes, they are a jolting
transition into the band’s ﬁnest tracks
to date. V

. Instead of devoting entire songs

L as tribute to a particular artist’s style,

Lawless begins to merge them all into a

fully—formed and uniﬁed sound. “Walk”

is a driving centerpiece, brimming with

feedbackand multi-layered guitar ﬁlls. it
1 On “Darlings,” the opening bars cruise

through a nonchalant funk jam before
promptly swerving into a dynamic punk

freak— out, replete with a wildly infectious .

bass groove. .
Sure, everything still sounds familiar,
but that doesn’t have to be a derogatory

" slight. Bands like Tame_Impala, Foxy-

gen, and Savages also artfully embody
a different era and sound, but are rarely
given the negative distinction of “retro.”
When Lawless strays from imitation and

about who is most responsible for
the team’s newfound success this
year. '

If they did, some names would
immediately be thrown around:
Andrew McCutchen, A.]. Burnett,
Jason Grilli. Newcomers Francisco
Liriano, Mark Melancon and Rus-
sell Martin might be cited, as well.

But none, not even MVP can-
didate McCutchen, deserves as

veteran manager, Clint Hurdle.

Hurdle, currently in his third
season with the Pirates, is no
stranger to turning around fran-
chises. He began his managerial
career with the Colorado Rockies
in 2002, inheriting a team with
a bevy of talent on offense but
no pitching rotation of whichto
speak. ‘

The lack of quality arms earned

career, and Colorado’s patience
paid off as, in his ﬁfth year, he led
the organization to its ﬁrst World
Series appearance in 2007.
Nevertheless, Colorado ﬁred
' Hurdle a year and a half later.
After a one—year stint as the
hitting coach for the pennant-
winning Texas Rangers in 2010,
Hurdle was hired as the next man-
, ager of the Pittsburgh Pirates, a
' lowly organization with little rea-

son for optimism besides a young
McCutchen.

Hurdle immediately brought a
sense of optimism to the city that
hadn’t seen a baseball team with
a winning record since George H.
W. Bush was ﬁnishing up his ﬁnal
year in office. ’ .

In 2011, the Pirates were in
ﬁrst place in their division as late
as July 19 before suffering a late-
season collapse. The 2012 season
proved to be yet another step in
the right direction, remaining
over .500 ‘until a mid-September
collapse.”

But 2013 has been different.
After another offseason of shrewd
maneuvers, Hurdle seamlessly in-
tegrated the-team’s new acquisi-
tions of Liriano, Melancon and
Martin into his depth chart.

It’s no coincidence that all

_three rebounded signiﬁcantly

from substandard performances
the previous season upon their
arrival in the Steel City. Hurdle
and his staff had their ﬁngerprints
all over the turnarounds of these
key components of the team’s run.
Historically, baseball mangers
have not been thought of as having
nearly as strong an effect on team
success as do football or basket-
ball coaches. However, beginning
with Oakland Athletics General
Manager Billy Beane and Tampa

managers have increased their
impact signiﬁcantly by becoming

Tonight, the Pitt women’s soccer
team (4-1-1) hosts the Boston Col-
lege Eagles (3-2) at Ambrose Ur-
banic Field in the Petersen Sports
Complex. The game will mark the

‘ﬁfth time the schools have faced

each other but only the ﬁrst time
that the two schools have ever met
in a conference game.

Matchup History

Boston Collegeleads the all-
time series 5-0 and has outscored
Pitt by a stark 12-2 margin in those
games. The last meeting between
the teams took place ‘in 2004,
almost 10 years ago, when the
Eagles defeated the Panthers 4-1.

Pitt enters tonight’s contest '

with an overall record of 4- -1 and

Bucknell (3-0), Central Michigan
(1-0) and Toledo (1-0)." The Pan-
thers tied Robert Morris on the
road, 1-1, but fell to Ohio State 2-0.,

The Panthers have yet to al-

low a goal at home this season, 5

outscoring their opponents 5-0.
Pitt goalie Nicole D’Agostino has
accomplished four shutouts so far

this year and allowed just three‘

goals in six starts. A ' '

The Eagles have been inconsis-

of the season thus far came last
weekend when the Eagles’ defeated
Ohio State-, 1-0, thanks to alate
goal off a comer kick. 5

' Although the win against Ohio’

State improved the team’s record
to 3-2, the team has" had some
head-scratching moments this
season — the most notable be-
ing a 1-0 losslto former Big East
member UConn..

In the ﬁrst game of the sea-

FOOTBALL

Pitt’s offensive line looks to reach potential in 2013  

Nate Barnes
Sports Editor

Pitt head coach Paul Chryst identiﬁed
winning the line of scrimmage as an as-
pect of football that would leadto success.;j"_7
That theory held true as FSU controlled 4
the line of scrimmage for most of its 41-13
victory on Labor Day.

But theman playing behind the line
of scrimmage and commanding Pitt’s of-

« fense that day was impressed with the way’.

his offensive line protected him.

“I think our offensive‘ line did a great
job,” said Tom Savage, Pitt’s starting
quarterback. “Our tight ends, running‘

‘backs did a phenomenal job of picking I
" up blitzers.”

Savage took the blame instead -— in

7 direct contrast to what a certain former

three-year starting quarterback would

say — for the two sacks ‘and two inter-

ceptions he threw against the Seminoles. _
“I take full responsibility,”lSavage’ said.

12:30PM

‘‘I gotta get the ball out quicker sol don’t
have to take those sacks.” I

Now, _over a week later, the offensive
line looks to build of that ﬁrst perfor-
mance and continue to improve after

being one of few bright spots in Pitt’s
'ACC opener. ‘ .

Redshirt junior guard Matt Rothera
has seen a lot now in his fourth year at
Pitt, after he was recruited to play for
Dave Wannstedt, played under Todd Gra-
ham and is now a bona ﬁdestarter in his
second year under Chryst. For Rotheram,
the takeaway from the Florida State game
was not as much about what was, but
what could be. - _

“I just think our potential is amaz-
ing,” Rotheram said. “This is the most
potential I’ve seen on an offensive line
We played on here, and it’s exciting.” 2

That potential was on full display on

— theﬁrst drive of the game, when the Pan-

thers scored on a four-yard pass from

Savage to Manasseh Garner to cap a nine-

play, 80-yard drive.

“There’s times in the Florida State’

game when we were out there and I could
feel it. I could feel that we’re going to be
A good team, I could feel it on the ﬁrst
drive,” Rotheram said. “I was like, ‘Wow, if
we can put it together like this, move the

ball, run the ball, protect the quarterback,

it could really be special.”’

What happened on that ﬁrst drive was
special, as Pitt opened a 7-0 lead on the
nation’sINo. 11-ranked team.

”‘ But as the game moved on, the Semi-
noles won out with a run that saw them
score 28 unanswered points. On the of-
fensive line, Rotheram attributed a great
deal of Florida State’s defensive success

- to lapses on the Panthers’ behalf.

Flanking the offensive line is a trio of
talented tight ends that saw signiﬁcant
playing time last week. Garner, ].P. Holtz
and even true freshman Scott Orndoff
will play an integral role  Pitt’s offense
this season. ..-2

And an integral part of that role is
blocking. . t

“The tight end position requires a lot
of blocking,” Garner _said. “So that’s al-

‘ ways going to be something that you can

always get better at.”

For Garner, who recorded Pitt’s ﬁrst
score as a member of the ACC, the build-
ing block for improvement is a funda-
mental one.

“I felt like we’ve gotta come out there
physical, number one.” Garner said. ‘V
“That’s just a part of the game.”

From there, Garner says the key to

. continue improving during 2013 is ex-

ecution.

“We’ve got to execute our blocks, we’Ve

gotta make the reads and the adjustments 2
_ that are required,” Garner said. “That’s

just somethingl know we can continue to
get better at throughout the season with
the different defenses that we will face.”

Garner’s faith will have a chance to
improve itself, as will the desire of R0-
theram, who couldn’t have picked a better
way to start 2013' when it comes to the
matchup of Pitt’s offensive line against
Florida State’s defensive line.

“We want to play good players. I want
to be recognized as one of the best guards

‘in the country, so I want to play the best

defensive line in the country,” Rotheram
said. “I think all of our guys, they. want
everybody’s best shot, too. They want to
play good players.” ' ’

When it comes to giving other teams
their best shot, the Panthers should refer
heavily-to their ﬁrst drive of 2013 as a
good place to start. "
V “If we do our job, if we do our part
and everybody does their assignments, it
should go the way it did the ﬁrst drive,”
Garner said. “That’s how it’s supposed
to be.” 3
