FOOTBALL

Savage leads
Pitt to upset
win behind

offensive line

Nate Barnes
Sports Editor

Tom Savage made his name nationally known
in September when he threw for 424 yards
and six touchdowns in Pitt’s high—scoring
win at Duke. Even NFL.com senior analyst Gil
Brandt went as far as to compare Savage to
three—time Super Bowl winner Troy Aikman.

Since Savage has averaged just 183.6 pass-
ing yards per game and thrown ﬁve touch-

downs against three interceptions in ﬁve

games, matters were complicated by an of-
fensive line that allowed Savage to be sacked
29 times — not to mention other various
hits — entering Friday’s game against Notre
Dame. '

But Saturday, behind an offensive line
playing possibly its best game of the year,
Savage delivered his best performance in
recent memory, leading Pitt to a 28-21 upset
victory over then—No. 24 Notre Dame.

“They were incredible,” Savage said of his
pass blockers. “They won this game for us.”

Savage was sacked just once Saturday

when Prince Shembo came off the edge for
a sack fumble.

Molly has developed a reputation as an
ubiquitous, often-abused and sometimes
deadly staple of the modern electric dance
music scene. But the most dangerous part
of the drug, according to experts, might
be that what the Molly concertgoers and
music fans are popping isn’t really Molly.

That means many who think they’ve
tried Molly probably haVen’t. Instead,
they’ve most likely injested some form of
the drug laced with a contaminant, such

' as heroin or an amphetamine. Molly, in its

untainted state, is rare.

Although many individuals who use the
drug might not know that they’re ingesting
possibly adulterated Molly, the effects of

  Pitt office hosts events to celebrate Veterans Day

A Abbey Reighard
Staff Writer

Bryan Adams survived a bullet wound
in Iraq, but struggled with normal life
when he came home. Last week when
he spoke at Pitt, he told others how they
can get help.

“I was in a dark, dark place, and it

wasn’t until I had that support at the

hospital that I could start to ﬁx things,”
Adams said last Monday at his talk.
Adams’ talk was one of three events
over these past two weeks coordinated
by Pitt’s Oﬂice of Veterans Services. The
program provides support for veterans
and military students transitioning to
student life and using government and
University tuition beneﬁts. Along with
Adams’ talk, the ofﬁce will hold two more
events this week in honor of Veterans Day.
These three events are part of what the

oﬂice is referring to as Veterans Week.
There are more than 400 veterans

I and students using veterans’ beneﬁts for

school. This past year, 142 new vetera
students enrolled at Pitt. 4 '

Ryan Ahl, director of the Pitt Ofﬁce of
Veterans Service who served two tours
in Iraq in 2004 and 2009, said that he
hopes that Veterans Week will inform
students at Pitt about veterans on cam-
pus and communicate the difficulties of
transitioning to life on a college campus
after active duty. A

This Veterans Day will mark the thir
year that Pitt has conducted the National
Remembrance Roll Call, which will be
held this year in Heinz Memorial Chapel
from 10 a.m. to noon today.

The names of Pennsylvanian service
men and women who died while serving

in Iraq or Afghanistan will be read for ‘

the ﬁrst hour of the event, and for the
second hour, participants will be able
to write thank you cards for individuals
currently serving overseas.

Speakers at the event will include G.
Reynolds Clark, vice chancellor for com-
munity initiatives and chiefof staff at
Pitt; John McCabe, president and CEO
of Soldiers 8: Sailors Memorial Hall; and
Staff Sgt. Paul Kantner of the U.S. Marine

_Corps, who was named 2013 Outstand-
ing Student of the Year in the College of

General Studies.‘

Throughout the day, members of the
Pitt Oﬂice of Veterans Services and vol-
unteers will collect donations for the
Wounded Warriors Project, an organiza-
tion that providesﬁnancial assistance to
wounded veterans and their dependents.

As part of Veterans Week, the Office of
Veterans Services will also sponsor a talk

by Pitt alumnus Bryan Bender, author of
the book “You Are Not Forgotten,” which
was published last month. The talk will
take place Tuesday fromls p.m. to 8 p.m.
in the O’Hara Student Center.

Bender’s book follows the true stories
of two American servicemen: Maj. George

Eyster V of the U.S. Army and Capt. Ryan ‘

McCown, a Marine Corps pilot.
McCown was killed during World War

II. Eyster sets out on a mission to New

Guinea to ﬁnd McCown’s remains and

‘ bring them home more than 60 years

after he was shot down in 1944.

To kick off Veterans Week, the Oﬁice of
Veterans Services sponsored Adams’ talk.
Pitt’s chapter of Active Minds, a mental
health advocacy group, sponsored the
event.

Club holds snowboarding competition on Cathedral Lawn

Luke Raber
For The Pitt News

The spontaneous roar of a crowd emanated
from the Cathedral lawn this past Friday
night.

About 150 people surrounded the
brightly lit, roped—oif section of the manu-
factured slopes by the log cabin from 7 to 10
p.m. for the Pitt Intercollegiate Snowboard
Team’s ninth annual Railjam.

Before the event, the team’s members
unloaded truckloads of fake snow from
U-Hauls to create the paths and set up two
different rails for the riders to choose from:
one kinked and one diagonal. This allowed
for a larger variety of tricks to choose from.
Riders lined up at the top of the slope and
took turns performing their best tricks on
their rail of choice.

The “railjam” is a common type of com-
petition forpreseasen sn.owb~0arding events
because it doezsnft require a lot ref snow,

which allows for the use of artiﬁcial snow.
It consists of a customized urban environ-
ment, similar to that of a skate park, in
which handrails are set up on a small slope,
and a path of snow is placed under them.
The contest was sponsored by Rome
Snowboard Design Syndicate, a company
based out of Waterbury, Vt., and was part of
its Parknado series, a string of exhibitions
held before the East Coast snowboarding
season starts. Red Bulland Seven Springs

Ski Resort, located about an hour southeast ‘

of Pittsburgh in Champion, Pa., also spon-
sored the event.

After a brief warm up, the roughly 25
contestants were divided into two groups
and faced off to see who could impress the
four judges. The judges were Rome Snow-
board representative Tom Dickey, Seven
Springs terrain park supervisorjeremy An-
derson and Seven Springs assistant terrain
park manager Sean Conne11y.’ -

The top 10 riders advanced to a ﬁnal
round where they put their best tricks on
display.

Jason Anderson, who won this year’s
rail jam, received a free Rome snowboard,
along with boots and bindings.

A D] played music and armounced op-
portunities for riders and attendees to win
free gear from sponsors. Challenges ranged
from being the ﬁrst person to name Mariah
Carey’s birthday to landing difficult tricks.
Attendees were also entered into a raffle if
they included a Parknado hashtag on an
Instagram or Twitter post of the event.

Contestants included students from
snowboarding teams at other schools’ such
as West Virginia University and Penn State
University, but were mostly composed of
the Pitt team’s members.

According to Alex Turnshek, the presi-
dent of the team, Pitt Intercollegiate Snow-
board was established in 2000 and is made

up of Pitt undergraduates, graduates and
faculty. About half of them are snowboard-

ers, and the other half are skiers. The club A

charges $30 in dues annually.

The team meets once a week throughout
the academic year, and when they aren’t
riding the slopes, members get together for
barbecues and other events so that riders
can meet each other.

The team is offering three big trips this
year. In December, members will head to
Killington, Vt., and in January to Quebec
City and Stowe, Vt.

Several riders said these trips are the-
highlight of their experience in the orga-
nization. , .

“My favorite memory of being in the
club is deﬁnitely the trip, Quebec City espe-
cially. Once, about ﬁve of us were caught in

MDMA

Gateway Rehabilitation Center. The center
is an organization dedicated to the preven-
tion, treatment, education and research of
substance abuse and alcoholism with sever-
al locations in southwestern Pennsylvania.
Capretto said that of the about 65 per-

cent of individuals at the center who are un-
der the age of 30, two—thirds admit to having
tried Molly —- that’s about 40 percent of all
the individuals he sees. And although most
of these individuals are in rehabilitation for
other drugs and state that Molly isn’t their
drug of choice, the common refrain is that
Molly is readily available at raves, parties
and electronic music concerts.

Molly and the body

Molly supposedly earns its name from
the molecule of pure MDMA it’s said to
contain. It’s supposed to be the clean—cut
form of MDMA, meaning that it contains no
contaminants — just 100 percent MDMA.

MDMA stands for 3,4-methylenedioxy-
methamphetamine and is considered to
have empathogenic effects, such as in-
creased empathy and prosocial feelings.

MDMA has become somewhat synony-
mous with the vernacular. However, Ec-
stasy isn’t necessarily MDMA: It’s MDMA
that is, more often than not, mixed with
a contaminant. Ecstasy, since it isn’t pure
MDMA, is easier for users to come across
than actual Molly. ~

Karl Williams, the Allegheny County
medical examiner, said his lab in Pitts-
burgh’s Strip District processes all of the
drugs seized by police in the county.

Williams said that a much larger amount
of the area’s MDMA—based drugs have been

. some form of contaminated MDMA, which

means they aren’t Molly.

However rare legitimately pure Molly is,
it’s nevertheless in hot demand right now
because of its effects. _

It affects the brairfs neurons that use
serotonin — which regulates mood, aggres-
sion, sexual activity, sleep and sensitivity
to pain —— to interact with other neurons.
Molly binds to the serotonin transporters,
generating excessive amounts of serotonin
in the synaptic space in two ways. First, by
binding to transporters, Molly prevents
serotonin from being picked up and moved
out of the synapse. Second, these transport-
ers can continue to bring in more serotonin,

activating a greater number of receptors.

“If your body had 100 units of serotonin
it was going to slowly release over the next
month [and] you take some Molly, it re-
leases 75 of them in the next [few] hours,”
Capretto said. “That feels pretty good, but
when you come down, you have to take more
and more. You’re running this deﬁcit of
serotonin.”

Using and coming down from Molly has
been described to the rehabilitation center
director as “Ecstasy on a Friday and Satur-
day” and then “suicide on Tuesday.”

“That can be an addictive quality,” Ca-
pretto’ said. “That’s not a fun way to feel,
so a quick way to get out of that is to do
more Molly.”

Ronald Cowan, of Vanderbilt Univer-
sity’s Cowan Lab, said that continued use of
Molly, Ecstasy or any other MDMA—based
drug could have permanent, long-term ef-
fects on the brain’s ability to produce and
regulate serotonin. Cowan’s lab, which has
primarily studied Ecstasy for more than a
decade, produced studies that found that
prolonged abstinence from Ecstasy—1ike
drugs — such as Molly —— can allow certain
parts of the brain to recover. Yet for those

individuals who continue to use such drugs, ‘-

permanent damage of the serotonin system,
such as the transporters, can occur in the
neocortex.

Such studies indicate that certain parts
of the brain that help transport serotonin
can be permanently damaged. Cowan said
that because of serotonin’s role in a wide
range of psychological functions, such dam-
age could have far-reaching consequences‘.

“Serotonin has a role in a vast range of
things, such as sleep-wake cycle, mood,
body-image perception, anxiety, depres-
sion, memory, sex drive and others,” Cowan

’ said. “It has a really, really broad role in

the brain, and if you lower the serotonin,
you can affect all of those to some degree.”

In the course of its studies, the Cowan
Lab looked at college students who had
reported moderate use of Ecstasy. The re-
searchers found that MDMA increases the
number of serotonin receptors, but has a
harmﬁil effect upon serotonin axons, the
part of a neuron that carries information
over long distances.

Cowan said that his lab is very convinced
that every time you take a hit of Ecstasy, you

are losing part of your serotonin system.

Cowan also said he has seen little evi-
dence to suggest that Molly is anything dif-
ferent from Ecstasy, so the effects of Molly
on the brain are relatively similar to the
effects of Ecstasy.

Molly and electronic music

The music scene most commonly associ-
ated with Molly is electronic dance music,
or EDM. This association is compounded
each time there is a Molly-induced death
at an electronic music festival. The two
deaths at the August Electric Zoo music
festival in New York City were attributed to
lethal overdoses of MDMA-related drugs.
In 2010, after an attendee of Electric Daisy
Carnival suffered from delusions after tak-
ing Ecstasy, she fell to her death from the
27th ﬂoor of her Las Vegas hotel.

This says nothing of the scores of con-
certgoers who are arrested for narcotics
possession at concerts such as Ultra Music
Festival, Bonnaroo and the aforementioned
Electric Zoo and Electric Daisy Carnival.

  

According to Tucker Vento, a Pittsburgh
DJ and producer, the recent rise in popular-
ity of EDM has caused many more concert-
goers to become interested in the drugs,

" which are typically available at shows and

events. The music’s shift into the main-
stream has opened up a previously small

“You might be out of luck in a small
town, but ﬁnd yourself at an electronic
music festival, and it’s hard not to notice
the people milling about the crowds asking
if you want to meet their friend Molly,” he
said in an email.

Vento said that Molly’s emergence as

subculture to a slew of new fans who ap-
propriate the culture in a way that sees the
drugs as the more important aspect of the
electronic music scene.

He said that while the drugs have always
been around, it’s only recently that their
use has become so prevalent. Now, they’re
easier to obtain than ever.

  

a vogue drug brings people to raves and
electronic music concerts who otherwise
wouldn’t have attended." This, mixed with

EDM’s increased notoriety, has exposed‘

many new young people to this drug.
Capretto says that Molly is in high de-

mand right now not only because of its ‘

media attention, but also because buying

it is easy. A capsule of Molly can go for as
little as $20 to $30 at a show or nightclub,
said Capretto. A

Each capsule typically contains one hit.
However, concertgoers are known to ingest
multiple doses throughout the course of
their “roll,” which is the colloquial name of
the duration for which a user experiences
the effects of the drug.

Now that these drugs are chic, as Vento
described them, the previously contained
culture of electronic music has found itself
ﬂooded with individuals who recklessly
consume MDMA drugs, increasing the
demand, market and number of people
making and selling MDMA-related drugs
and the clean—cut Molly. With the increase

VETERANS

Adams spoke to more than 30 people
gathered in the William Pitt Union Ball-
room about his struggles with post-trau-
matic stress disorder after serving in Iraq
from 2004 to 2005.

Representatives from Talk About It, a
mental health advocacy group, and Pitt
Vets, a veterans advocacy group, also at-
tended the event.

Adams suffered a gunshot wound to
the leg during a patrol in Tikrit, Iraq,
in 2004.

He said that for the ﬁrst month after
he returned home, he received a lot of
support from his friends and family.

But Adams felt frustrated and irritable

as he tried to adjust to everyday life.

He worked at Home Depot and then
Sears. He was ﬁred from both jobs.

“I couldn’t deal with the managers. I
couldn’t deal with the customers,” Ad-
ams said.

Adams said he became sad, anxious,
irritable and found that he couldn’t toler-
at_e being in crowded places. He couldn’t
relate to anyone about the way he was
feeling.

He tried attending community college
in Massachusetts with a friend who had
served in Iraq with him, but left because
he was disinterested in his classes and
often found himself distracted from his
work.

After Adams attended a group therapy

session at a veterans’ hospital and heard
the stories from fellow veterans, he de-
termined that he had PTSD.

Adams called his parents and opened
up to them about his disorder and about
how he had been feeling since he came
home.

Adams now shares his story with oth-
ers because he believes that the struggles
of soldiers as they transition from mili-
tary duty need to be addressed.

“If you’re dealing with something and
you’re not talking about it, how are you
helping? These stigmas are bringing us
down,” Adams said.

Sophomore and former active-duty
Marine Matt Hannan, president. of Pitt
Vets, said that Adams"story is similar to
that of many service men and women.

“We all have different reasons for serv-
ing, but we can relate to each others’ ex-
periences. I wanted Bryan [Adams] to

know that he is not alone,” Hannan said.

chase. As a result, pure MDMA — actual
Molly —— is becoming harder to procure.

Mike Manko, a spokesman for the Al-
legheny County district attorney’s ofﬁce,
said that while the rate of seizure with the
use of Molly and other forms of MDMA has
increased, it’s are nowhere near the rates
of seizure associated with more dangerous
drugs such as cocaine or heroine.

SNOWBOARD

a white-out blizzard for about an hour only
to have it clear up to a sunny sky with fresh
powder runs in front of us,” Turnshek said.
The more experienced members do not
always limit themselves to the slopes.
According to Christopher Keiper, a ﬁfth-
year Pitt senior who has been part of the
organization since his freshman year, the
riders are always looking for new spots such
as handrails, ledges and walls in Pittsburgh
on which to do tricks when there is enough
snow. _
“We’ve found some gems around the city,
mostly handrails and more creative stuff
in some of the parks. I hit that doubled-up
handrail on the ﬁfth side of tower’s patio
when we got all that snow my freshman year.
I had to wait for a red light so no cars would
hit me landing [on] Fifth,” Keiper said.
According to Keiper,~When looking for an
urban snowboard spot, aside from a good

. snowfall, riders need either a good slope

to help them build speed before hitting a
rail, or there needs to be somewhere to tie
a bungee cord so that riders can pull them-
selves to gain speed.

Not only did the riders in the contest
provide great entertainment for the crowd,
but they also made many people excited for
snowboarding season.

Pitt juniorjasonjandrew who attended
the rail jam said the event helped him “real—
ize that winter isn’t always awful.” He also
enjoyed the chance to watch the snowboard-
ers’ skills. V

“I love the fact that it isn’t even boarding
season yet and these guys are trying tricks
on their ﬁrst rail of the season that I wouldn’t
even try on my last,” Jandrew said. I

Manko made it a point to stress that just
because the media is paying more atten-
tion to MDMA-related drugs does not mean
that their use is only a recent occurrence,
regardless of the hype surrounding recent
related events.

Vento said that he thinks that this atten-
tion feeds into a cycle: More people want the
drug when there’s more attention paid to
it, which attracts more people to the manu-
facturing and selling of the drug. And, he
said, “As with any high-demand product,
you get knockoffsz”

 

“So now you have a lot of people doing
irresponsible things in even more irrespon-
sible quantities, and you have drugs that
are tainted with who -knows-what,” Vento
said, adding that such a recipe could cause
the death of concertgoers.

Cowan said that deaths from these sorts
of drugs are very rare, as researchers be-

. lieve that thousands of young people use

them every weekend, and the amount of
deaths isn’t proportional to the amount
of suspected consumption. While people
do occasionally die from MDMA-related

7

drugs, Cowan said that it is usually because
of contaminants, which are believed to have
caused the Electric Zoo deaths last August.

Williams’ lab’s ﬁndings attest to how
frequently Molly knockoffs are laced with
a contaminant. Out of all the MDMA sei-
zures his crime lab has seen, hardly any
of them have produced pure, clean-cut
MDMA, meaning that these drugs aren’t
Molly: These seized drugs are part MDMA
and part something else.

“We’re just plain not seeing pure
MDMA,” Williams said. I

Tired Twitter accounts cheapen

webs

Sophia Al Rasheed
Columnist

As Twitter shares rose above 70 per-

cent after its initial public offerings

late last week, speculation over the
consistency of 'I‘witter’s growth has

become a concern. The numbers in-
dicate the success and popularity of
the website, but some investors are
worried thatthe momentumwill be
difficult to maintain. The company
did spike in its number of users in
2011, but this increase isn’t likely
to continue, as Twitter has failed
to gain a following as strong since.

But for a much more impor-
tant aspect of the website —— the
creativity and quality of Twitter’s
content — this lack of growth is a
good thing.

It might not appear so at ﬁrst,
but those who have been with Twit-
ter since before the recent increase
in popularity are aware that Twitter

is anartform, andthe recent expan-
sion and increase in users has only
cheapened this effect. The sale of
Twitter stock in hope of expanding
the company’s number of users is a
classic example ofﬁnancial and per-
sonal gain interrupting a precious,
and slowly decreasing, art form.

A little clariﬁcation: If you don’t
consider 'I‘witter an art form, then
you probably use it in the incorrect
way. What distinguishes Twitter
from other networking sites lies
 the content that surrounds
it. In order to have a successﬁ1lac—
count, you’re conﬁned to writing
tweets that are worth posting—- ba-
sically, tweets thatwill be of interest
to everyone else. This sounds odd,
considering social media usually
screams “Look what I did! Look at
me!” but when you View success-
ful Twitter .accounts, you will see
that they pander to their audience.
Whether your tweets come in the

te’s intended use

form of retweeting a news article,
serve as an outlet for your politi-
cal views — the tweets during the
2012 presidential debates were a.
goldmine —- or, most commonly,
provide other users with comedy,
you need to take your followers
into account. Bragging about ac-
complishments or  about
your day, which is what many users
incorrectly use Twitter for, are not
a good use of the canvas.’

Now the problem with the spike
inpopularity is that many new users
do not adhere to these guidelines
that maintain the quality of tweets
and choose instead to contribute
ﬂashy or naggingtweets. Orworse,
some misused tweets provide are-
peat of current personas and jokes:
for example, the ﬁve separate “She
Ratchet” accounts that thrive on
these repetitive jokes and have
managed to acquire a huge follow-

ing despite their lack of authenticity. Many
of the accounts that have contributed to the
million—user increase last year are .simply re-
peating jokes that have already been made
or personas that have already been taken.

_You’ll likely ﬁnd “female problems” and “The

Hangover” character Alan Garner accounts
—— commonly referred to as parody accounts
— to tweet the same line such as “I would
rather break my ﬁngers than make two trips
to get my groceries.” ‘

What surged Awkward Girl to popular-
ity in the ﬁrst place was the ability for her
to appeal to a wide audience of people, and
this was accomplished through her distinct
understanding of the awkwardness ofbeing a
20—somethinginalarge college setting, atask
that isn’t easily accomplished by everyone. It
takes talent to create a genuinely entertain-
ing account and requires actual experience.

Twitter as a company might hope to have
its number of users grow, but the quality of
the website internally rests on a select few
who can contribute to it and a select amount
of tweets to keep material from being cheap-
ened or becoming repetitive. In this case, it’s
essential for quality to reign over quantity.I

Panthers show

multiple looks

on defense in
big Win

Ryan Bertonaschi
Staff Writer

Pitt men’s basketball’s defense took a step
from the norm during Friday night’s 88-55
season-opening win over Savannah State
when, on several occasions, head coach
Jamie Dixon revealed a few fresh modes
of attack.

Dixon typically resists change on de-
fense, employing a strict half-court, man-
to-man set. But college basketball has
evolved since Dixon took over in 2003:
More fouls are called, more zone is played
and fewer points are recorded.

Thus spawned the evolution of Dixon’s
defensive philosophy.

On Friday, point guards James Robin-
son andjosh Newkirk put extended pres-
sure on Savannah State’s point guards.
The two picked their men up well past
the half-court line and into the Tigers’
end of the court.

Newkirk said the three- quarters ﬂoor
length pressure was no coincidence, rath-
er, a strategy imposed by Dixon.

“We just want to disrupt their offense
by picking them up,” said Newkirk, a
freshman, who had 11 points and four
assists in 24 minutes of play. “We just want
to take some time off the clock so they
won’t get into their offense as easy.”

Because center Talib Zanna -- who
will return next game, according to Dixon
— served a one-game suspension for vio-
lating team rules, junior Rutgers transfer
Derrick Randall made the start against Sa-
vannah State and held his own defensively.

After the game, Randall said Dixon
taught him a lot of the defensive hedging

Vinopal turns tide with three forced turnovers

FOOTBALL

Ray Vinopal intercepted Tommy Rees twice in the fourth quarter and forced a fumble. Ben Brownlee | Staff Photographer

Ryan Bertonaschi
Staff Wrz'ter

Four years into his college career, Ray
Vinopal is still in the midst of many
beginning stages of his development..

This season marks the 5—foot-10,
200-pound free safety’s first full cam-
paign as a starter, andit just so happens
that Pitt’s defensive coordinator and
safeties coach, Matt House, is midway
through his first year as well.

Vinopal, a redshirt junior, is regu-
larly spotted chasing down opposing
running backs and receivers who burst
into the open field, and has been seen as
the defense’s scapegoat during multiple
games this season.

During Saturday’s 28-21 win against
Notre Dame, he was the subject of heavy
scrutiny in the first half of play, particu-
larly after getting beat down the ﬁeld
on a 38-yard pass play from Tommy
Rees to tight end Ben Koyack, the cor-
nerstone play in Notre Dame’s second
touchdown-scoring drive.

On the play, the Fighting Irish fooled
Pitt’s secondary with a play-action fake.
While Vinopal took off for running back
George Atkinson III, Koyack continued
toward him.

Once Vinopal realized Rees still had
the ball, it was too late.

“I thought I had to ﬁll in the run
gap,” Vinopal said. “It wasn’t very good

eye discipline. I tried to recover, and he
made a play.”

Like any athlete faced with adversity
in the early minutes of a game, Vinopal
stressed the importance of resilience.

“Forget it and move on,” he said.
“That play’s not going to help us win
the game anymore.”

At the time of the touchdown, Vino-
pal was unsure of how\ short — or long
— it would be until this resilience would
pay dividends. It took hours until the
third play of the fourth quarter, when
the Irish had threatened to regain the
lead. -

the majority of Savage’s passing yards, and

B Street noticed the improvement from his

“I think he was just being patient,” Street
said. “Hewas conﬁdent in himself, and the

Coach Chryst did a great job ofdialing it
up. Everything just came together tonight.”

But everything started on‘5‘the line of

play necessary to help Pitt score its biggest
victory of the 2013 season.

“I thought that he made some big throws.
I thought he competed when they weren’t
there,” Chryst said. “He got some positive
yards, he protected the ball.” '

In addition to his passing, Savage ran
eight times for 28 yards to ensure the
Panthers kept gaining positive yardage in
contrast to taking drive—killing sacks and
forcing his offense into down—and—distance
situations.

Of course, Chryst wants his quarterback
to throw the ball, and Savage stepped up to
this challenge the best he has in nearly two
months. And, as the center of attention in
each huddle, Savage became the leader a
team expects from a quarterback.

“He competed, and that rubs off,” Chryst
said. “He put himself out there and made
some really good throws.”

As for Savage’s evaluation of himself Sat-
urday, he didn’t wax poetic about anything
he did. The end result was all that mattered
for a senior at his third school in ﬁve years.

“I probably should get down a couple
more times and slide,” Savage said. “Other
than that, I’m just happy we won.” 3

skills he exhibits today.

Hedging breaks up the offensive ﬂow
of the pick—and-roll. During a hedge, the
defending big man steps out to tempo-
rarily cover the ball handler off a screen,
giving the ball handler adequate time to
recover from the screen and get back to
his man.

Dixon has always placed a high level of
emphasis on defensive hedging. Similar
to extending pressure on point guards,
hedging takes time off the clock, slowing
the game’s pace.

      

“Since day one he taught me how to
hedge,” said Randall of Dixon. He said
learning Dixon’s system of hedging is an
ongoing process. “I just got to get there
quicker andgput my hands up. I’m just

‘so anxious to jump out and just be on

defense. I got to learn from all the fouls
I [sometimes pick up] .”

Another way for Pitt to kill time while
on defense" is by playing zone. Dixon spar-
ingly used a two—three zone Friday, al-
though he said there is more to come.

“We will be playing more zone,” Dixon
said. “We zoned during some [out—of—
bounds plays]. We did a little bit of trap-
