VOLUME EIGHTY-SIX, ISSUE s 

Brackenridge to house Greeks

By Heather Gahres
For The Pitt News '

Starting next fall, Brackenridge
Hall will house seven fraternities
and a sorority.

Greek adviser Bridget Guernsey
said, “The plan was offered to all
of the fraternities who do not
own or have a house already.
There were 11 fraternities who
were eligible. Most groups have
not been able to find adequate
housing or a place to put their
letters because of the
communities.”

The North Oakland community
has been pushing for years to get
rid of unzoned fraternity houses.

Guernsey said, “Any time we can
alleviate community problems,
we’ll try our best to do it.”

Pi Kappa Phi secretary Eric
Scerbo said, “We need something
to call our official home. A place
in Brackenridge would be a great
way to have a place on campus
where we could hang out
between classes and hold social
functions.”

The offices of Student Affairs,
Housing, and Residence Life have
been working collectively on this
project. This hall's policies will
be similar to those at sorority
housing in Amos Hall, where
sorority members who do not
live in the hall can enter with a

special pass.

No official number of floors
have been set aside yet for the
fraternities. “Right now, two or
three fraternities will be sharing
floors with one another, but we
hope by the fall of '93 that each
group will have its own ﬂoor,”
said Guernsey.

According to interim director
of housing Robert Hopkins, no
more than five floors in

" Brackenridge will be given to the

fraternities.

“Having these ﬂoors open to
the fraternities would not be
possible without the new
dormitory. Adding those 600 beds

Watered-down Right
to Know bill pushed

in state legislature

By Jenna Ferrara
News Editor

A bill which would allow Pitt to reveal only the salaries of its
highest—paid employees was introduced by the state Senate
Education Committee chair yesterday.

The Higher Education Fiscal Disclosure Act is a scaled—down
version of a bill passed 202-] in the state llouse last year that
would require Pitt and other state-related universities to disclose
their financial records.

The new bill, proposed by Sen.James Rlioades (R.—Schuylkill),
does not require these schools to divulge information about
research contracts and pension plans. It also does not mandate
that they answer questions from the public about their finances,
as the original bill had required.

The legislation was discussed in the senate last night,
Rhoades’ staff said yesterday.

Rep. Ron Cowell (D.—Wilkins) introduced the original
legislation passed by the House last year. Cowell was unavailable
for comment.

But Cowell has said he is confident his original bill will pass
“sooner or later. We’re going to prevail.”

His bill was passed amid public outcry about former Pitt
President Wesley Posvar’s $5.3 million retirement package.

The new legislation would affect Pitt and Temple, Lincoln
and Penn State universities, all schools that receive 10 percent

Western Psyc/9 studies suicidal tendencies of Prozac users

By Robyn Petrella
For T be Pitt News

Western Psychiatric Institute & Clinic is
investigating the side effects, such as
suicidal tendencies, often associated with
the use ofthe anti-depressant drug Prozac.

Controversy surrounding this drug has
forced many health-care professionals to
re-evaluate the effects of prolonged use.

According to Dr. James Perel, director of
pharmacology at WPIC, the Prozac trials

are only reaffirming what many in the

health-care world know: depressed
patients on any medication often
contemplate suicide.

Most depressed patients have thoughts
of suicide when they begin to feel better
as a result of their medication. Perel
explained that this phenomena occurs
because before taking the drug, patients
are too lethargic to consider suicide. These
results were the same among patients on
Prozac or tricyclics, he said.

Perel said most practitioners prescribe
Prozac because it’s much safer than other

anti-depressant drugs. A patient cannot
overdose on Prozac, and Prozac doesn’t
cause heart disease and hypertension like
many other anti-depressant drugs, Perel
said.

According to Perel, the benefits ofProzac
outweigh the disadvantages.

The small percentage that did have side
effects with Prozac and either attempted
or committed suicide said they were victims
of a medical experiment, according to
Perel.

Perel, who is also a professor of

psychology and neuroscience at the
University of Pittsburgh, said the benefits
ofusing Prozac far outweigh the defects of
the drug. Perel said the allegations brought
against Prozac have been discredited by
clinical trials.

The current Prozac trials revealed no
distinct correlation between the drug and
suicidal tendencies, he said.

The statistics also showed that patients
on Prozac with suicidal tendencies had
attempted suicide before, according to
Perel.

Cavalla oversees V

By Susan Swiderski
For T be Pitt News

Walk into Room 140 of the William Pitt
Union, and you are entering the domain of
Joe Cavalla, the director of Student Activities
and the William Pitt Union. The space is as
much a part ofhim as the pipe he has smoked
for 15 years.

Cavalla completed his graduate and
undergraduate work at Rider College in New
Jersey. He taught high school for two years
before returning to Rider as the director of
student activities and the union.

“I was the director of activities there for 20
years. In fact, the multi-purpose room in the
union at Rider is named after me,” Cavalla
said. “It was a nice honor for 20 years of
work.”

The former director of student activities
here, a friend ofCavalla’s, told him about the
opening at Pitt.

“We knew each other in New Jersey. One
day I got a call, and one thing led to another.
I applied and got the job. That was five years
ago.” Cavalla said.

Right now he is involved with computerizing
the Student Activities Office, looking for
ways to fund future improvements in the
union and supervising the ongoing task of

“I truly enjoy working in the college/
university atmosphere,” Cavalla said. “I could
just sit in my office and shufﬂe papers, but
that wouldn't be me. It is the contact with the
students that makes this job so enjoyable. I
feel very proud when a former student calls

ast diversity of S

tudent Activities

to let me know they made it. Hopefully I had
a little something to do with their development
and success.”

Cavalla himself is a student again. He is in
the doctoral program of higher education
and administration at Pitt.

“It was something I always had in the back
of my mind, I wanted to see what it was like
and if I could do it. I’ve had the on—the-job
training for 25 years. Now I want to learn
about why I’ve done the things I’ve done.
Plus, it’s so accessible. All I have to do is cross
the street,” Cavalla said.

Outside of the University, Cavalla is an avid
sports buff who enjoys following the
basketball and baseball career of his 15-year-
old son and bowling with his wife of 25 years.

Growing up in New Jersey has made the
shore a favorite spot and he and his family
travel to the East Coast beaches every summer.

And smoking his pipe is another favorite
activity.

“I enjoy smoking my pipe. It just seems to
fit into the educational setting like those little
tweed caps. And before the smoking ban,
people always knew where to ﬁnd me!”

The pipe, like the position, fits Cava1la’s
personality perfectly.

“I truly enjoy this setting. I have had the

Winter Carnival gets cool response

By Heather York
For The Pitt News

Food, fun and slime were part
of the sparsely attended Winter
Carnival held in the William Pitt
Union last night.

The carnival was part of the Pitt
Program Council’s Meltdown ’92
celebration, which continues
tonight and tomorrow.

Last night’s festivities featured
games and food booths made by

various campus groups. Students
tried their luck and sampled treats
purchased with PPC tickets, which
cost 25 cents each.

“This is a great chance for
organizations to get involved with
students and get more publicity,”
said Shari Bienstock, a PPC
committee member selling tickets
at the carnival.

help organizations raise some
money,” Pitt student Jennifer

CGS to worle on recruitment

The College of General Studies Student Government Council
wants to work on a student-recruitrnent internship plan that
could help the school’s enrollment problem, but the program still
must be approved by Pitt President J. Dennis O’Connor.

Kusbit said.

In honor of the festivities the
Kurtzman Room is decked with
balloons, an igloo and giant
penguins. -

One highlight of the evening
was homemade slime, concocted
by the American Chemical Society
for four tickets.

The unique brew was similar
to slime sold in plastic containers
in toy stores.

“It’s a great meditation tool,”
said society member Bill Sikora.

Sigma Chi and Lambda Chi
Alpha both gave away condoms
as prizes. ~

“It’s a great opportunity to save
money on condoms,” said Sigma
Chi brother Ari Palitz.

“This is a great way for students
to see the different activities to
get involved in," said student Lori

Cafeteria rat succumbs

By Christine Hanna
stag" Wﬁter

Last week Pitt's Tower A cafeteria had a special visitor —-— a rat.
The vermin was spotted by Pitt student Christopher Mumola.

According to General Manager of Dining Services Roger Bosse,
there was a rodent in the cafeteria, but the problem has been
taken care of.

Bosse said Pitt contracts out all pest control to Orkin, which
comes in once a week. As soon as the rodent was observed,
Orkin was immediately called in.

“After a visual inspection Orkin laid down traps and tracking
powder. Then they did a complete inspection of the entire facility
and found no droppings or signs of nesting. It was their
professional opinion that this was an isolated incident and as
Orkin mentioned to me, a stray,” Bosse said.

The rat could have entered through a pipe, which has now
been sealed off, Bosse said.

Mumola said, “One of the workers ended up smashing it with
a broom handle and killing it.”

Bosse confirmed that the rodent was killed in that manner.

“I think the whole organization through housing and food
service is a professional organization, and we do maintain high

 

Prishack. “And the brownies are
great!”

The plan focuses on enabling students to earn credits within
the SGC and the internship program by giving community
presentations to recruit CGS students.

According to council President Marcie Roberts, O’Connor
V wants to see more enrollment statistics before the plan can_
progress.

Roberts also said admission criteria to the Alumni Association’s
new Blue and Gold Society is unfair to CGS students. The criteria
include leadership qualities and working for the society a
minimum of 10 hours a week.

“The lO—hours—per—week work schedule will discourage CGS
students because most are non—tradiu'onal and have other
responsibilities.” Roberts said. “It’s hard to prove that you are a
leader, work at least 10 hours a week and still do everything else
you need to do.”

' The Alumni Association will look into the matter, according to
See CGS, page 5

Sizemore fosters dea

By Lisa Tylak

S¢a_[7' Writer

The comment on the teacher-
evaluation form read, “You’re
loud and biased, and it makes us
interested in your class.”

This remark was meant for
Barbara Sizemore, a professor in
Pitt's black studies department,
who laughed heartily as she read
it. .

“’Ihey call me intimidating,”
she said and explains her
“intimidation” as active efforts to
get her students to argue about
their ideas with her in class.

She admits that her energy for
the debate sometimes scares
them.

But Sizemore said she manages
to let them know she cares about
them, which is what is really
important to her.

‘‘I know all of my students
personally because they are
people. I teach people. I don’t
teach subjects,” she said. Si’/emore
is known for her activism in issues

of racial equality and equal
opportunity in education.

“I believe all children can learn,”
she said. She is concerned about
children that others ignore, such
as minorities or those with
learning disabilities. She describes
herselfas a mentor for her students
who come up against any
problems.

“I have an open-door policy. I
have 114 students this term, and
any one of them can come to me
with any problem.”

While Sizemore shows obvious
affection for her students, they
share that affection with her first
love: teaching.

Since she was raised an only
child in a house full of adults, she
admits that she looked forward
to school as a child.

“School was actually my favorite
place. I liked school, and I still
do,” she said.

She graduated from North-
western University with a degree
in classical languages in 1947,
and she received her master’s in

elementary education from the
same school in 1954. She has
taught every grade level from
kindergarten to college
throughout her career.

She began teaching in Chicago,
where she stayed until 1975, when
she left to become the
superintendent of schools in the
District of Columbia Public School
System.

At that point she encountered
the first real stumbling block of
her career. She was dismissed
from her position in 1975, because
of differences between her and
the new school board.

“I’m not a person who’s easily
defeated,” she said. But another
defeat soon followed when she
lost her campaign for an at—large
seat on the city council.

Things turned around for her
in 1977 when she came to Pitt as
an associate professor in the
Department of Black Community
Education Research and
Development.She became a full
professor in 1989.

She sees the black studies
department as more professional
now than it was when she arrived
here.

She calls her colleagues in the
department “producers” who all
strive to accomplish different
thingd and hopes to see the
department expand to include a
graduate program.

Throughout her career she has
written 20 chapters in books and
19 articles in journals. She has
also published a book about her
experience as superintendent of
schools in D.C., called The

Some students who do not

V belong to Greek organizations

said the program is unfair and is
making university housing even
more inaccessible to them.

“I think there is such a housing
problem already that taking five
floors for Greeks discriminates
against students that aren't
Greek,” said sophomore Bev

. .. Schwartz.

First-year student Mike Metrik

- said,3“lt’s not bad because it gives

the fraternities a meeting place,
but it is also depriving
upperclassmen of the suites that

they deserve."

Senior Todd Pinkney said the

university should also be trying
to find housing for black
fraternities. “If they're going to
do things for fraternities, I'd like
to see them do something for the
black fraternities. They don't have
anything.”
_ The contracts will originally be
set for one year. “We’re using the
first year to get the fraternities to
buy into the idea, and also to see
what their needs are," said
Guernsey. After the one-year trial
period, the university would want
the fraternities to sign three—to-
five—year contracts.

The fraternities will have to
fulﬁll certain housing obligations
in order to move into
Brackenridge.

“The fraternities will be
expected to fill their floors. If
they cannot fill the floor, the
fraternity will have to pay for the
cost of the beds not being used,”
said Hopkins.

The fraternities will also have
to follow Residence Life and
Housing regulations. “The
fraternities are not a unique entity,
and therefore all regulations will
apply since they are not living in
private housing, but university
housing," said Hopkins.

The brothers of Delta Phi voted
unanimously not to take a floor
in Brackenridge. Delta Phi Vice
President Robert Bruggeman said,
“We didn't want to go back under
the university housing policies,
like the hassles of signing people

in and out. We also would rather
buy a house than spend money
remodeling Brackenridge.”

For the first year, Brackenridge
will not be remodeled. “After the
first year, the fraternities will be
able to remodel. However, they
would have to OK all renovations
through housing and pay for the
changes themselves,” Guernsey
said.

This plan could also increase
the numbers of students entering
rush. “We would be right there
on campus where most of the
freshman guys will be,” Scerbo
said. “I think it will also provide
better communication between
IFC members, since we will be
closer together, and the
fraternities will be in three primary
areas: on thehill, in Brackenridge,
and in North Oakland."

There are still some concerns
about the plan, such as fears that
the university will back out on
the arrangement. “Our 17,, guys
are depending on us getting a
ﬂoor in Brackenridge for their
housing.” said Scerbo.”Some of
them may not pick numbers in
the lottery, or start looking to find
a nice apartment, because they
are relying on this floor.”

Another concern is security.
The fraternities are worried that
someone may come on their floor
and destroy fraternity property.
“We want a_ security system to
prevent other fraternities and
independents from getting ‘onto
our floor. We want this for both
security and privacy," said Scerbo.
The security system the fraternities
want would allow students to get

off of the elevator only on their
floor with the use of keys. The
fraternities would like the security
system to be installed by fall.

Hopkins said that it is more
likely that the security system
would resemble that of the
Towers, with security doors
between the floors and the
elevators, and limited access to
floors through the stairwells.

“If the fraternities are worried
about an outsider getting-‘i?r'ito"’
Brackenridge, that is what security
is for. If they are worried about
an insider destroying something
on their ﬂoor, that is what the
Judicial Board is for," Hopkins
said.

Seven of the 11 eligible
fraternities have shown .interest
in the housing proposa so far.
These seven include Pi Kappa
Phi, Phi Sigma Kappa, Sigma Phi
Epsilon, Kappa Sigma, Sigma
Alpha Mu, Lambda Chi Alpha,
Alpha Epsilon Pi and the one
sorority, Theta Phi Alpha.

The offices are trying to
coordinate a tour of the hall for
the prospective fraternities. No
exact deadlinehas been set for
applying for space in
Brackenridge, but they hope to
have the housing contracts signed
before spring break. ’

There will be a period of
evaluation after the first year.
Hopkins’ outlook is positive. “We
think itwill provide a good service
and hopefully create a positive
relationship between the
fraternities, our organization and
the campus, much like Amos
Hall has.”

StARcompiles racism questionnaire

By Alissasmith
For The Pitt News

In an effort to become an
organization dedicated to action,
Students Against Racism is
compiling a questionnaire geared
toward people with racist
thoughts and actions.

The group will meet next
Wednesday at 8:30 p.m. in the
William Pitt Union to discuss the
survey’s content, which was not
specified further.

StAR had distributed a survey

last year asking questions directed-

to victims of racism, but only a
few of the surveys were returned.

“Many of the freshmen on my
ﬂoor don’t understand each
other’s different religions and
cultures.”

She said the problem came
from students being too
intimidated by their ignorance of
differences and being afraid to
ask about them.

Solanko thought the survey
would be a good way to begin
education and involvement in
stopping racism.

StAR is also working on a project
to create buttons and T-shirts
displaying their logo.

The group plans to set up tables
in the Towers lobby and the

Acting Presidentjoe Babinsack

He also encouraged more

ship positions in the organi-
zation.

He distributed a “Call to Arms,”
which urged students to “Be

anything to get some attention
on the matter. Together, though,

State Rep. Ron Cowell’s amendment to Pennsylvania's
Right to Know law had passed the house almost

‘ unanimously, and Pitt students, faculty and staff breathed

a collective sigh of relief. Last fall they presented Cowell
with 3,600 signatures on petitions supporting the opening
the financial records at state-related universities.

4 The bill was passed in the wake of revelations that
former Pitt President Wesley Posvar had received millions
of dollars in a retirement settlement that made students
paying out-of-state tuition gnash their teeth in pain.

But if Cowell’s bill passes the senate, we thought, maybe
administrators would never receive another $3.3 million
retirement package — ever again.

Maybe “golden parachutes” would be a thing of the past
like the Burger Chef that used to be in the Cathedral of
Learning. ‘

But the chair of the senate Education Committee decided
he could vastly improve on Cowell’s bill —— by taking the
teeth out of it. The morally idealistic document that was the
Cowell bill might be gutted and skinned if this new version

I of the Right to Know act passes.

Under Sen. James Rhoades’ bill proposed in the senate
yesterday, only the highest-paid employees at Pitt would
have to divulge their salaries.

Public inquiries for financial information could be
rebuffed with a “We don’t have to tell you,” from the frosty
receptionist at the front desk. ‘

State-related universities wouldn’t have to reveal
individual salaries. Only “median and mean” salaries by
academic rank and job classification would be public
knowledge. Pension plans and research contracts would
be kept from the public as well.

Rhoades is sending a clear message: even if these
universities receive state money, they are still to be treated
like private institutions. State-related institutions don’t
need to be completely financially accountable to the

' taxpayers that fund them, according to Rhoades, “our

friend in Harrisburg.”

Administrators have traditionally acted the same way,
according to Cowell. Pitt was public when it needed
money from the state and private when it came time to
reveal sensitive information.

“Every time Chancellor Posvar came to us, he said, ‘[Pitt]
‘is a public institution, and you need to give /us more
money,”’ Cowell said.

Cowell knew last fall that the senate was hostile to his
House Bill 1075. “The Senate has not been helpful to our
cause,” he told a crowd at Pitt in October. I-lis prophecies
have come true.

The state senate should not approve the Higher Education
Fiscal Disclosure Act proposed by Rhoades. The
overwhelming public support for the Cowell bill and the

-202-1 vote passing it in the House are testimony to that.

occasional joke. Do not, I repeat,
DO NOT assume that the material is factual or
intended to inform. Thank you, and have a good
day.

You know, some people have no sense of tact.
I'm not just talking about your Aunt Hildegarde,
who tells you that your QPA couldn't get you a job

' in an Alaskan salt mine. The person I'm referring to

is Yoshio “If the shoe ﬁts, eat it” Sakurauchi, a

member of the Japanese parliament. Last week he

called Americans “laz'y" and “poorly qualified.”
Who? Us?! Surely you can't be serious!

I am serious, and don’t call me — oh, never mind.
Anyway, yes, he really said it. You can check
Sunday’s Pittsburgh Press if you don’t believe me.
I saw it right before I went to the comics page.

As you might expect, this statement caused a lot
of grief across the country. Some contractors in
California cancelled contracts with Japanese firms,
and an Illinois gas-station owner put in his two
cents by offering a two—cent discount to American
car owners. Strangely, though, no‘Mazdas have
been returned for Pintos.

Not wanting to jump on the bandwagon of Japan-
bashing, I decided to look into what Sakurauchi
said, starting with definitions of “lazy” and “poorly
qualified.” -

According to Websters New World Dictionary,
“lazy" is another word for “sluggish,” which is
another word for “slime—dripping.” This just proves
that Sakurauchi is dead wrong. The only American
workers who drip slime tend to run for public
office.

“Poorly qualified” was difficult to find. I looked
up “poor,” and it said “unfortunate.” Webster's
deﬁnes ‘‘qualified'’ as “ﬁt.” In other words, Sakurauchi
called Americans “unfortunately fit." I think the
translators screwed up somewhere along the way.

The U.S. Department of Labor Statistics also felt
offended by Sakurauchi. Arthur Neef of said
department claimed that laziness “is not something
we can measure with statistics." Actually, it is, if you

sleep, V stands for hours of TV
. watched, B is the number of
beers consumed and T represents the time spent
sleeping, drinking beers and watching TV when
you should be in class or at work. Divide that whole
mess by 24, the number of hours in a day, and there
you have the Sloth Quotient — SQ, which stands
for just how lazy someone is. Take that, Arthur
Neef. _ .

The average American sleeps about four hours,
watches about four hours of TV a day, drinks, on
average, four beers a day and misses, let’s say, four
days of work in a month. (The SQ is easier to figure
out if you only use one number for everything.) So
if we plug all of this into the formula, the SQ turns
out to be 7.6. Not bad, eh?

Compare that to the Japanese, though. They
sleep about four hours (I'm guessing —— this is not
a fact), don’t watch much TV at all (besides, it's not
American TV, so it doesn't count) and don’t drink
beer. (If you've ever had Japanese beer, you know
why.) With all of these zeros, the SQ turns out to be
less than nothing. '

This is all well and good, but what the heck can
we do about it? ’

There are a few options, actually. First of all, we

could simply nuke the Japanese back into the stone H"

age. The problem with this, besides the subsequent
death and destruction, is that the last time we tried
this we rebuilt them. Depending on who you listen
to, this is how our problems started in the first
place.

Our best bet, if you ask me, is to raise their Sloth
Quotient. We need to start exporting more sitcoms
and more Old Milwaukee.

Maybe Tokyo should get a football franchise
when the World League of American Football
(WLAF) expands. The White House should make it
a national priority to get the Japanese to watch
more TV and concentrate less on their work.

Anyone catch the Super Bowl on Sunday?

It seems as though the
foundation that Paul
Hackett has tried to build
for Pitt football is a bitshaky.
Emphasizing academics
and a team concept, which
were not prevalent during
the Mike Gottfried era,

Dere
Willis

Hackett has produced
results. He has made
progress. But ‘there have
"also been setbacks. ,

Recently, two Pitt
assistants left the staff for
NFL coaching jobs.
Defensive coordinator Fred
von Appen and special

teams/receivers coach Jon ‘

Gruden were both Hackett

’ appointees, and Gruden

had only been at Pitt since
‘ last spring.

While Pitt has been long-
known for producing both
NFL-caliber players and
coaches, this is not a great
sign for the program. Von
Appen was a volatile coach
at Pitt. Much has been said
and written of his
relationship with players
like Keith Hamilton, who
left to go to the NFL while
von Appen was still here.

Perhaps the biggest
impact will be felt in
recruiting. Both coaches, as
well as I-Iackett, have
connections to the
professional game. Most
high—school players want
to get the chance to play in
the pro ranks‘ and will
usually give a good listen
to a school with a coaching
staff that can help them.
This is whatenables schools
to get rather large amounts

In Pitt’s case, one star

Hockey mozuls/lllegloeny College, 9-]

By John Labriola
Staﬁ” Writer

The hockey team of Allegheny College was
an hour late for its game with Pitt on Sunday,
and it might have been better for the team if
it hadn’t come at all. The Panthers
outnumbered and outplayed the Gators,
winning 9-1.

Sunday’s competition took place at Golden
Mile Ice Center in Monroeville, the home of
Pitt’s hockey team. Faceoff for the competition
had been set for S p.m., but the Gators did not
arrive at the rink until 6 p.m.

“There was a rnix-up in the starting time,”
Gators captain Eric Hagan said. “All year our
schedule has said 6 p.m.”

According to the official schedules that
Michael Kaleina, the commissioner of the
Western Pennsylvania College Hockey
Association, mailed to all media outlets, the
time of faceoff was set for 5 p.m.

Unfortunately, being late was only the tip
of the iceberg for the Gators: They still had to
deal with the Panthers on the ice. The Pitt
squad was ready to go when the Gators

Lady Panthers fe pressing style

By Rob Mazur  a
Sports Editor _

 

When the Georgetown Hoyas
and the Pitt Lady Panthers met for
the first time last season, the Lady
Panthers ran away with a 20-
point win, 8S~65.

However the Hoyas changed
their entire offensive style
between meetings and rebounded
for an 80-72 revenge when they
met later in the season. _

That change in offensive style
late last year has allowed
Georgetown to jump out this

record, 7-1 in the Big East. Their
lone loss came at the hands of the _
powerful Miami Hurricanes,
currently riding the nation’s
longest winning streak at 17
games.

According to Hoya head coach
Patrick Knapp, the switch from a
basic work—'the—clock—for-a-shot
offense to a more aggressive run-
and—press style has done more
than create turnovers. It has
allowed the Hoyas to expand
their offense. '

“After we switched styles last
year, we started to win more
games,” Knapp said. “It’s allowed
us to‘do more things offensively.”

The goal of the run-and-press
style that Georgetown uses is to
create a turnover, score and then

arrived at the rink.

“We were fooling around on the ice,” Ed
Gregorchik said. “We were running through
some drills because we had already paid for
the ice time."

The competition only lasted for one hour
and was curtailed at 7 p.m. In that time
period, the teams were able to play two
complete periods and the start of a third.

The Panthers had two main advantages
over the Gators.

First, they had had an hour to warm up.
Second, they also had a seven-man. Pitt had
20 hockey players suited up to play, while
Allegheny only had 13.

The Panthers led the Gators in every aspect
of the game — right down to the Panthers’
most glaring fault: penalties. The Pitt team
gathered nine penalties, while the Gators had
five whistled against them. ~

The only shining point for the Gators’ team
was their goaltender. The Panthers assaulted
him with 57 shots and netted nine.

“Although they are weak defensively, they
have a very good goaltender,” Pitt captain
Dave Koval said. “When you’re shooting two

or three at him at a time, he’ll stop a few of
them. But sooner or later you’re going to get
one by him. Their goalie was excellent. Fifty:
seven shots and we only scored nine goals."

The Gators may have had trouble readjusting
to the ice.

“Now they have all of their big goons
back,” Koval said. “A lot of their players have
just rejoined them because most of their team
plays football during the first semester.”

The Panthers were able to hold the Gators’
goons to one goal. Since the West Virginia
game two weeks ago, the Panthers have been
playing as a team. '

“We’ve really gelled since the WVU game,”
Koval said. “I think our attitude has changed
since we went down to their building and
came away with a [4-4] tie when we should
have won.

“We still have a lot of individuals who are
always going to play good. It's just that the
team attitude is a lot better,” Koval added.

The Pitt hockey team will be taking on the
Duquesne Ice Dukes this Friday night at the
Civic Arena. Faceoff is set for 7:30 p.m.

try to get another turnover before
the other team has a chance to
catch its breath.

Another thing the run-and-press
style has allowed them to do isto
become more team-oriented. Last
season stellar guard Kris Whitfill
averaged 22 points a contest. The
player with the second—highest
average was fellow guard Tricia
Corace with 11. .

Whitfill’s numbers have
dropped off slightly this season.
She currently averages about 17
points a game. However forward
Leni Wilson has helped pick up
the slack, raising her average to
15 a game, up from five points a
game a year ago.

“All of our players contribute
this year,” Knapp said. “We’re
not looking to any one individual
to contribute the offense. We've
won games where Kris takes 11
shots in the entire game, and
we've won games where she
takes 18. She understands that
she’s part of a team, and she
understands her role on the team.
She’s improved her defense, and
she’s playing even better defense
than a year ago.”

Lady Panther head coach Kirk
Bruce said that while he realizes
Whitfill may not be scoring like
she was a year ago, his team still
can't rest easy.

“She really lit us up [for 38

points] down there a year ago,
but she hasn't been putting up
those numbers,” Bruce said.
“However as a team they’ve been
real effective.”

One difference between the
current Pitt squad and
George town ‘s team is experience.
Georgetown returns all five
starters from a year ago. Of those
starting live, only one (sophomore
guard Niki Reid) is not a junior or
a senior. On the other hand,
forward/center jonna I-Iuemrich
is the only Pitt starter returning
from a year ago. The rest have
either graduated, left school or
been out with injuries.

Knapp said he sees having

mostly juniors and seniors as a
distinct advantage.

“We're basically a team of
upperclassmen,” he said. “All of
our players contribute. The
younger players realize that the
older ones share the experience,
and if they work hard in practice
and bide their time, they'll get
their chance. It also pushes our
older players when they see the
younger kids working hard.”

The Georgetown attack should
give the Lady Panthers the biggest
problem in the one position that
has been a sore spot all year:
guard. '

Gymnastics and hockey mix in New England

' DURHAM, N.H. — Oh, my God! Was it cold!
The weekend in New England, which I felt
would be more or less just another quick
hop up to New Hampshire for a women's-
gymnastics competition and then a quick
hop back to Pittsburgh, turned out to be a
very interesting time.

The trip went from a cold morning in
Pittsburgh to an even colder mid-morning in
Boston, Mass., to a still colder afternoon in
Durham, N.H.

I'm talking about the kind of cold that
makes you want to just crawl under a nice,
warm comforter with a good book and just
veg out for a few hours.

The Pitt women’s gymnastics team
competed in New Hampshire this past
weekend with none other than the University

V of New Hampshire and Northeastern

University.
Although Pitt’s team didn't place first or
break any school records, it was a pretty

‘ interesting time.

The Lady Panthers went into this
competition with a pretty laidbark attitude.
Although they performed strongly, they didn’t
let the fact that they were there to compete
drag their spirits down.

When the team arrived in Boston, we had
the opportunity to meet the Pittsburgh Bulls
Major Indoor Lacrosse team, which was in
town to play against Boston. We also met

John Labriola

the assistant coach of New Hampshire’s ice-
hockey team.

Jeannie Vecchio, one of the Lady Panthers’
team captains, managed to have the
gymnastics team invited to Saturday night’s
hockey game against Northeastern, an
incident that would turn out to be a real

experience.

Most of Pitt’s gymnasts had never been to
a collegiate hockey game — or any hockey
game for that matter. Although they are very
big football fans and attend all ofPitt’s home
games, they didn't know too much about
hockey. They learned extremely quickly.

I, personally, as well as most of the people
that were sitting around us, found the Lady
Panthers to be a fresh breath of air to
hockey. During the game we were seated
with most of the parents from the UNH
team. Both the parents and myself have

been to an uncountable number of hockey
games, whether they were pee—wee
hockey, high-school hockey, collegiate
or professional, these 11 girls made the
game twice as interesting.

No matter who it was that had the
puck, no matter who it was that was
winning, the gymnasts cheered for
violence.

Whenever anyone would be checked
into the zone where we were sitting, the
girls would scream and yell for every and
all hits.

Most on the penalty calls were renamed
by the gymnasts as well. When a holding
penalty was assessed, the gymnasts called
it a hugging penalty, because guys aren’t
supposed to hug during a game.

A roughing penalty became a mugging
penalty. There were a few other things
that they renamed that turned my face
red and made my side hurt because I was
laughing so hard.

One of Pitt’s first-year athletes, Mikie
Myers, looked at UNH’s mascot, a light
blue wildcat, and yelled, “Look! lt’s an
alternative cat!”

Rugby football club seeks to gain support of school

By George Klimis
Staff Writer

The scrum — the moment in
rugby when the forward packs
from two squads face off to take
possession of the ball. Eight men
from each team bind together,
putting their heads on their
teammates hips, gripping jerseys,
wrapping their arms around the
next. guy and digging their cleats
into the turf, ready to clash with
the other team and push them
back from the line of scrimmage.

The University of Pittsburgh
Rugby Football Club seems to be
in a constant scrum for recognition
from the university, and
sometimes the team feels as if it
is getting pushed backward.

Pitt’s rugby club organized in
the fall of 1990 for the first time in
seven years. The club had been
"suspended indeﬁnitely by the
university in 1983 after Pittsburgh
police found several teammates
playing rugby on the Cathedral
lawn, using stolen human cadaver
heads as game balls.

Despite that event, the current

 

rugby team is trying to get a fresh
start on campus with new players
and a new coach, Tom Miller.

“We want to get off to a fresh
start with brand new people,”
said Miller, who in his first season
as coach led the Panthers to a 4-
0 record.

Miller said he feels that the
events in 1983 should not be
blamed on the current team.

“I wasn’t in Pittsburgh back
then. Neither were most of the
players,” he said.

The team is funded completely
by the players. It gets little or no
help from the university to pay
for uniforms, equipment or
transportation to road games.

“This isn’t allthatunique,” Miller
said. “Most college rugby teams
do not get much support from
their universities.” Miller said he
realizes that Pitt is a larger campus
and that it is not privately funded.

“I am not dismayed about the
money,” Miller said. “What I am
dismayed about is that we don't
have a field.”

Rugby at Pitt is a club sport
right now, but the team -has

expressed hope that it will
eventually become a varsity sport.
Seeing as the team does not even
have a playing field, varsity status
could be a long way off. “How
can we get to be a nationally
ranked team without support from
the university?” Miller said.

The team practices on the
Cathedral lawn and often has to
compete with other students who
play there.

Another big problem with
having to share the Cathedral
lawn is that the hard surface is

not good to practice on.

“I have never had so many
players complain of ankle injuries
and shin splints in all my
experience in rugby,” Miller said.

According to Miller, Pitt rugby
is not the only club sport fighting
for a field. The men’s lacrosse
team and several women’s sports
are also without fields. The
university went to the city for
fields, but after Miller talked to
Reggie Young, head of Citiparks,
Miller found that the city gave
nothing to Pitt.

Miller, who coached two All-
Americans at Haverford College,
said he feels that Pitt has
enormous potential. “We went
undefeated last fall,” Miller said.
“I think we can play with
nationally ranked teams and do
well.”

However, without university‘

support, the members’ potential
may not be realized.

“That’s the tragedy: to work
hard and not get support and to
not see the full potential of
someone,” Miller said.

Miami brings slow-down style to Fitzgerald Field House

 

By Derek Willis
Sports Editor

just a few notes on the
upcoming Pitt-Miami game and
the rest of the Big East:

Pitt vs. Miami: The Panthers
are looking to break a four-game
losing skid, while Miami is looking
to stay in the building until
halftime, at least. It may not be
that bad for the Hurricanes, but it
sure isn't great.

Since entering conference play,
head coach Leonard Hamilton
has installed the ugliest slow-
down offense ever. Aside from a
huge upset ofSt. John’s, it has not
proved to be very effective. In
their last game, a 60-40 loss to
Georgetown (boy, that had to be
the ugliest game ever), the
Hurricanes shot an anemic 30.8
percent from the field and made
just six of 18 free throws.

,. Surprisingly enough, they actually

shot worse against St. John’s, a
45-42 victory. U-(3-l.-Y is the sort
of idea I’rn trying to get across
here.

Not that Miami will always be

' this way. Hamilton is just stalling

for time and hoping to avoid
monumental blowouts in his first
Big Iiast season. 'l'he Hurricanes
do have a legitimate team, but it
is devoid ofexperience and short
on talent.I lamilton employs a 10-
man rotation, which in a slow-
down game should keep
everybody fresh. However
freshness does not equal shooting
ability in this scenario, and that’s

 

  
    
   
  
 
   
 

where Miami suffers. Leading
scorerjerome Scott averages just
1] points while playing over 35
minutes a game. In addition, there
are no other players who currently
average double figures in scoring.

Scott is a senior swingman who
can play at either guard spot and
at small forward occasionally.
Scott is a fairly effective three-
pointshooter, but he is limited by
his responsibility to rebound; he
ranks third on the club in that
category.'I'he rest of the team are
generally poor shooters. The only
one who makes more than halfof
his shots is forward Hammie
Ward. Unfortunately for the
Hurricanes, Ward only shoots
three times a game on the average.
Several players can score,
however. First—year forward
Ochiel Swaby is the best three-
point shooter (48 percent) and
also does a decent job at the foul
line. Swaby is not exactly a
selective shooter, and for his size
(6—feet, 8-inches), he absolutely
refuses to rebound.

Since the offense is not stellar,
the emphasis has to lie on the
other end. Defensively, the slow-
down style does shock some
opponents and almost always
disrupts their game plans. 'Ihe
Hurricanes will foul a lot, and
they limit their opponents to just
/I3-percent shooting from the
floor. A few players to watch:
Swaby, Scott, Anthony and Pat
Lawrence and 7-3 Constantin
Popa. Talk about tall.

Anyone who enjoyed watching

J. Dennis O’Connor

President

the Pitt-Georgetown game last
week will also like this one.
Hamilton uses plenty of
substitutions, has almost no
offensive continuity and will be
very stubborn in his slow-down
game. Should be an ugly one.

Around the Big East: What is
it with this Seton Hall team? The
more I see them, the more
confused I get. One thing I can
say: It is a much better club with
Arturas Karnishovas in the lineup,
especially defensively. Still, head
coach P.}. Carlesimo needs a
slashing-type forward who can
ignite an offense. P.]. is making a
pitch for Baltimore high-school
star Donta Bright but will likely
finish behind Ohio State or
Maryland in that race. The Hall
already lost All-American forward
Rodrick Rhodes from Jersey City
to Kentucky. ‘

Villanova also continues to
puzzle me. The ‘Cats are talented,
I suppose, but they also play far
beneath themselves on occasion.
The senior leadership of players
like Marc Dowdell and Chris
Walker is extremely overrated.
Calvin Byrd is good, but when
will he get solid minutes?

When the Panthers look for
holes to fill for next season, one
they will have to shore up is the
outside shooting. Someone who
could shoot off the dribble could
be invaluable to that team. Pitt
has been pretty quiet during
recruiting season, but it is making
noises about Quincy Lee, a 6-4
guard from New Jersey.

opportunity it provides. Certainly
students who decide to begin
their medical careers at Pitt would
be justifiably upset if some of the
better instructors picked up and
left before they got there. No one
would say anything if those
students wanted to go someplace
else because of that kind of
situation.

In fact, most people would
probably be surprised if those
students did not choose to go
elsewhere.

It is the same way with high-
school students who happen to
be excellent athletes. The dream
of being a nurse or doctor is
replaced with the dream of
playing professional sports. Often
in sports, as in academia, an
important factor is the quality of
teaching at the school.

Natural talent, whether it be
athletic or intellectual, is great,
but it can always be improved
through quality instruction. And
the quality of instruction is a big
factor in many athletes’ decisions.
They want to be coached by a
person who will ' help them
achieve their goals and has the
personal commitment to the

 

student-athlete.

Generally, most teachers I know
aren’t in it for the money. Call
them crazy, but what really
matters to them is the teaching
part, to which they feel a certain
responsibility.

Sure, I’m idealistic, but
wouldn’t it be a solid step in the
right direction for Hackett to be
able to guarantee incoming
student—athletes that the reason
they chose Pitt will still be there
when they come?

In recruiting, Pitt needs all the
help it can get. In Pennsylvania,
‘it has to compete with Penn State,
Notre Dame and Syracuse for the
top prospects annually. Even
Pittsburgh’s backyard is an area
of fierce competition for players
who, in years past, would be
considered Pitt property, so to
speak.

In one such instance, Penn
Hills High School lineman Barry
Tielsch recently signed to play at
Penn State.

In some recruiting circles, this
was considered a fairly big coup
for Nittany Lions head coach Joe
Paterno because of the proximity
of Pitt to Tielsch’s home and the
excellent reputation Pitt enjoys

linemen.

It might be a question of
stability. When you look at Pitt
and Penn State, you see two very
different programs. Paterno is the
very model of stability, while
Hackett’s first two full years at Pitt
have been marred by
suspensions, defections and a
revolving door of assistant
coaches.

If Paul Hackett wants to win at
all costs, that's one thing. But that
is not the case, as he has
demonstrated.

Still, there has to be a certain
feeling of stability within the
program, or else it has little
credibility among players. College
is a time that most students want
to enjoy and remember for the
rest of their lives. Coaches should
endeavor to produce a
community feeling for their
athletes and make them conﬁdent
that they can excel on and off the
field.

Not only would this be
beneficial in athletic terms, but it
would help to bridge the gap
between the athletic program and
the rest of the university
community.

 
 

    
  
  
   

Hoyas

the other former starters, Maureen
McConnell, a two—year starter at
point guard, quit school due to
personal reasons. Then
sophomore jenine Joyce had to
take a redshirt this year.

While first-year point guard
Carol Morton has been a
surprising contributor for Pitt this
year, she is also second in the Big
East in turnovers with 4.6 a
contest.

The Georgetown style of play
could take its toll on the
inexperience in the Pitt backcourt.
Bruce said he understands this,
though, and knows what his team
has to do if it is to come out on
top.

“We have to stay with their
press,” Bruce said. “We have to
score off of the press break,
however, because they don’t just

press then fall off into a half-court
defense. They continue to trap
and pressure the ball. That will
be the key. We probably will end

up shooting quicker than we : l ’

normally do, but we’ll have to do
that in order to have a chance."
One thing that the Lady

Panthers and the Hoyas share is I

the need to operate as a team.
Their reasons, however, are very
different. Georgetown needs to
operate that way because of its
offensive sets. Pitt needs to play
that way in order to survive.
Off-season losses have"

dwindled the Pitt ranks down to E

a mere 10 players.

Nagging injuries to Lisa Fessler,
Turia Ransom and Tiffany Fingers
have limited their effectiveness
and playing time, often leaving
Bruce with only seven healthy
