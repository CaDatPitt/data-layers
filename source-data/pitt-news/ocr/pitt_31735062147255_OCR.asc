Pittsburgh Fogs Don’t Bother
A Young Lady From London

 

Miss Margaret Turner, Practicing Architect In England,
Leaves Today After Visit To University Campus

 

“l’ve heard a lot about the South.
I’1n sorry I haven't seen m11ch of it,”

says G. Margaret Turner of London,
who leaves for home tonight after a
two-day visit to the University cam-
pus.

Miss Turner, a practicing architect
in England and graduate of Liverpool
and London Universities, arrived
here Monday night from New York.
She has beeristaying at the Kappa
Alpha Theta house, where she and
Housemother. Cooper, also British,
have discussed the Thames fogs pro
and con.

“This has not been my first visit to
Pittsburgh,” said the young lady in a
decidedly English accent which she is
certain she has lost. “A party of us
arrived here in August, and some pa-
per or other took our picture on the
roof of the Downtown YMCA, of all
places.” -

“Yes, I know about the Cathedral of
Learning and the view from Mount

Washington,” she anticipated. “We
don’t learn much American history at
school, so that I had to learn here
about the three rivers and General
Braddock.”

“War seems rather close
doesn’t it?” Miss Turner inquired,
changing the subject. “You always
think it can happen only to the next
fellow until it strikes you. But may-
be we'll stay out. I suppose you would
call that the good old British policy
of ‘muddling through.’ ”

“But what about our campus?"
asked your reporter, who has to get
in some connecti‘on~with the Univer-
sity with every interview.

“Oh, I like it very well,” Miss Tur-
ner replied. “I suppose‘ that every
visitor praises and marvels at your
Cathedral, "but I've been impressed,
like everyone else. -

“I ‘sat in on’ a few classes today,”
she added, with a perceptible quoting
tone. “It’s novel hearing you talk so
possessively of our poets."

Registration Total
Is Now 8,0l3

Including registrations of Sat-
urday, October 5, the total enroll-
ment of the University stands at
8,013, according to John G. Quick,
University registrar.

The ﬁgure represents an in-
crease of 366 over the one of last
year, that mark being 7,647.

A ﬁgure of 1,500, indicated in a
headline of Monday's issue of
The News as the increase in the
enrollment over last year, was
erroneous.

Panther October
Issue Features
Glassford Story

“Laughs From the Football Field”
will form a major part of laughs in
the October issue of the Pitt Panther,
according to Russell Connolly, C36, ed-
itor. ihe magazine will show its
ﬂashing yellow and black cover com-
bination around the campus next VVed-
nesday.

William “Biff” G-lassford, star var-
sity football guard, is the author of
the piece which gives,‘ some insight in-
to the funny side of't‘oo'tball. Advance
notices indicate that Paul “Bomber”
Shaw, sophomore end, provided a
large percentage of the humorous in-
cidents which Glassford has compiled.

Other articles in the coming num-
ber include “You Can Never Tell,” by
Ruth A. Nickel, C37; a bit of political
dialogue in very light vein, by James
Donoghue, C38; and some sort of
treatise by Al Bert, C36, on the new
insurancerwrinkle adopted by the Uni-
‘ ersity football ticket agencies to pro-
tect customers against inclement
weather.

“The magazine will have more car-
toons than a Mickey Mouse produc-
tion,” suggested Connolly. “Also,
there will be all the regular features,
including more gathered gossip by the
mysterious Panther Prowler.” No one
has as yet discovered the identity of
the author of the Prowler column, and
thus no one has collected the year's
free subscription. The chase is still
on.

News Style Show
Voting Continues

 

Manager Tumpson Demands Polls
Keep Open Despite Full Boxes

The department of building and
grounds, according to good authority,
is contemplating action against Ellis
H, Tuinpson, BA36, business manager
of The Pitt News.

The department has been forced to
work overtime lately taking care of
numerous ballot boxes posted about
the campus by Tumpson for the elec-
tion of models for the coming News
Fall and Winter Style Show.

The boxes have caused plenty trou-
ble inasmuch as they: constantly re-
quire emptying. Expecting surcease
this week in view of the closing of
balloting, the department’s morale
took a decided upward trend. _

Tumpson now comes through with
an announcement that balloting will
continue through today——absolutely
the last day.

“Haven’t you got enough ballots as
it is?” asked a department attache
Friday. “Those boxes have been
filled up every day with nominations.”

Tumpson’s rejoinder was that the
balloting at present, even though it
is up in the high ﬁgures, is too close.
The more ballots, the greater should
be the differentiation among the
leaders, he stated.

I nominate for models at The
Pitt News Fall Style Show:

Our Dancing Ladies

" OEDS WILL DANCE with coeds tonight at what is
1 ‘, ostensibly known as the “Cloed -Prom.” It's a pretty
nice -gesture on the part of the women to show that they
can -get along without the men and have a roaring good
time doing so. - ' —

While to "the outsider the affair gives off a faint impres-
-siouof a premature Halloween party, there is little doubt
‘but ‘that the occasion furnishes a lot more to freshmen

~a»nd."u'pperclassI'nen than a chance to knock the tar out

of papa’s gray felt -hat. .

Somehow we feel that the women at Pitt are shown
the time of their lives as. undergraduates. -And though
this one affair sends fathers and brothers and rather
-slitghﬁtly-built uncles to the wardrobe in search of suitable
‘suits for the. girls, and ‘though a ‘pair of suspenders may
-p'uzzle—.——i‘f not hang—a coed and though rugged taxicab
drivers may swoon at the sight of red-tinted cheeks

above slightly large blue shirts, if-the women enjoy the ,

dance and become ‘better acquainted—and the chorus
seems predominantly in the afﬁrmative—then let it con-
tinue.

. A contemporary college editorial writer has pointed
out- that “the picture of girls dancing together appeals
to us as much as an egg sandwich without an egg.”
The fellow goes on to suggest an all-male dance in re-
taliation.

Jus't,to provide one good shudder for the day, it might
pay to consider a Pitt all-male dance. The sight of an
Industrial Engineer doing a fox trot with a Chem Spe-
cial, or a Schoolof Mines sophomore Waltzing with an
Aeronautical Engineer freshman is impossible to focus
with a clear head. No, there will be no Pitt all-male
dance tonight or any other night. And there will be no
one maimed in the rush to the refreshment counter.

All the women ought to have a great time at their
-Prom. And if some of the freshman girls decide that
they would rather go to the Soph Hop with that smooth

Editorial Of The Week I
Advice To The Rush-Worn

From “The Daily Trojan"

 

ECAUSE at this time of year everyone on and off

campus is laden with inside information and advice
on the rushing and which-one—to-accept situation, the
Daily Trojan proffers its bit to the problem.

_By this time, rushees should have their choice narrow-
ed down to three or four groups in which they think they
would ﬁt and to which they think they have it good
chance of receiving a bid. Time should not be wasted
by -a rushee on a fraternity in which he deﬁnitely is not
interested; for neither does a fraternal group wish. to
spend time with unfavorable prospects.

One invitation to a dance or a luncheon date at a
Greek-letter house is not sufficient to become well-ac-
quainted with any group. In fact, it is comparatively
simple for a fraternity man to give a hearty welcome to

a ﬁrst-time luncheon guest. It might be surprising to
see the “cordial” fraternity man in class the following
day. Members of houses are also astonished at times
when their “nugget” of a rush party turns out to be a
“dummy” on campus.

Baird's Manual, available at any library, should be
secured to investigate the national ratings of the Greek-
letter organizations. It catalogs the histories, dates of
founding, chapter rolls, rules of governing and addi-
tional information on each national fraternity in an im-
partial manner. National name alone should not entirely
sway a rushee’s choice, for campus rating is important
and often varies from the national status.

Beware of “typed" houses—four years is a long time

« "to hear about only one line of endeavor and achievement.

A well-balanced group is to be desired. Choosing a
-group w-hichtwil-l stimulate as well as receive new per-
.-sonality to good, advantage is important.

School Of Education Compiles

Su1°_v_ey_ Of Wellesley System

Changes Recommended
In Massachusetts
2 Town’s Plant

Climaxing a summer of intensive
investigation into the school system of
Wellesley, Massachusetts, the staff of
the School of '-Education recently is-
sued its report.

Invited by the board of education of
the New England town to aid in re-
organizing its school system, the
committee under the direction of Dr.
Charles E. Prall, dean of the School of
Education, is distributing a 147-page
booklet to the citizens of Wellesley.

Actual work on the survey was done
by Dean Prall and members of the
School of Education faculty last May.
During the summer, a statistical analy-
sis of the ﬁndings was completed and
arranged in booklet form. The pur-
pose of distributing the booklet to
citizens of the town, is to obtain their
reactions to the proposals of Dean
Pral1’s committee, with a view to re-
organizing the same.

Each of the eight chapters, begin-
ning with an analysis of the existing
school plant at Wellesley and going
through from a proposed building
program to an analysis of operating
costs of the \Vellesley schools, is
ﬁlled with signiﬁcant data presented
in readable and attractive style.

W'hile certain changes in the edu-
cational organization of the school
system are recommended by the sur-
vey committee,.the greatest immedi-
ate need is shown to be the revamp-
ing of the present school plant. This
will involve the renovation and re-
modeling of certain existing buildings,
the building of new schools located

- ‘ so as to more effectively serve the

community, the redistricting of the
pupil population, and the immediate
building of a new junior-senior high

. school. »

“I believe the survey will prove
worth while and quite helpful to
Wellesley,” said Dean Prall in com-
menting upon his committee’s work.
‘‘It is an unbiased report,” he con-
tinued, “-for each of the chapters is

' prepared by specialists who, after in-

vestigating the situations themselves.
bave ‘presented their ﬁndings and
their recommendations without bias or
prejudice and with only such direc-
tion as to make possible a. uniﬁed re-
port." -.

Dean. Prall was assisted in the
actual work at Wellesley and in the
preparation of the report by Dr.
Anthony M. Goldberger, professor of
education; Dr. G. A. Yoakarn, pro-
fessor of education and director of
courses in elementary education; Dr.
Robert V. Young, associate professor
of education; Dr. Percival W. Hutson.
associate professor of education and
sociology; Dr. Chester A. Buckner,

professor of education, and head of-

the division of professional educa-
tion; Dr. Carl D. Morneweck, assist-
ant professor of education; Dr. Wil-
liam A. Yeager, professor of educa-
tion, and Mr. S. H. Jones, a11 authority
on buildings, who at present is as-
sisting Dr. Buckner in planning the
Cathedral rooms.

Little Washington Puts On Fine Show
For Pitt Followers Going To Game

That Pitt-W. & J. game Saturday
certainly put a lot of color into V.7ash-
ington, Pa. Celebrations were preced-
ing the game ‘-for several days, ac-
cording to the natives.

 

The main hotel of the town featured
some very tricky menus on Saturday.
For one dollar you could get-“Chicken
Halibut Steak, Saute, Meuriere, Jock
Sutherland,” of “Fried Half Spring
Chicken, Co'u‘n't'ry Style, Bobby La-
Rue.”

Not to slight the local boys, “Cream-
ed Calf Sweetbreads with Ham in
Cassolette, Paulekas" was being offer-
ed for one dollar, while “Braised
Swiss Steak, Bordelaise, [Hank Day"
was not by a long sight so tough as
Mr. Day's line.

 

Dex Very, the referee, showed up
only a few minutes before game time,
due to knicker trouble. As he pre-
pared ‘C0 dress for the ﬁeld at the
hotel, Mr. Very discovered to his con-
sternation that he had neglected to
bring along the regulation white
pants. He had just about decided to
go out and referee this thing in a.
bathrobe when the hotel manager
came along, saw his plight, and pull-
ed a pair of fairly white knickers out
of the moth balls.

 

Hot dogs were sold from paper box-
es and by the time the young vendors

reached consumers in the stands the
Wiener sandwiches were -as cold as
some of the spectators’ feet.

 

Townsmen around the little city are
among the most affable warriors im-

aginable. State police didnt get much
chance to view the game, what with
minor outbreaks of ﬁghting happen-
ing almost constantly. ,.

One of the most congenial fellows
stood out among the b_attlers and smil-
ing offered to take on "anyone in the
place.

 

When littler Boy Scouts are made,
they'll probably join the Washington
troop. Whether the age restrictions
there are different from those in Pitts-
burgh, it was not learned. Some of
the uniformed little fellows who did
the ushering were so small that you
could group ﬁve or six of them into
a. pup tent and have enough room left
to swing a lasso. But the lads were
very efficient, none the less.

 

The prize package of them all was
delivered by one of the VV. & J. fresh-
man program vendors, who evidently
had not heard clearly about his
school’s retrenchment policy in the
matter of subsidizing athletes. This
lad went roaring through the stands
with an armful of books and his sole
line of chatter was: “Names. num-
bers, and salaries of all the players.”

It somehow seems odd that a fellow‘ O
up in New York can sit down to his‘

typewriter and pick out an all-time
football team for a University in Pitts-

burgh.
That. is precisely what George
Trevor, football writer of the New

York Sun, has done. The all-time Pan-
t..er aggregation is the ﬁrst of a series
to be selected by Trevor. The Pitt
News presents that writer's selections
as the opinions of one man and as a
basis for perhaps some interesting
controversy on the subject of all-time
Pitt stars.

Joe Donchess, who was doing some
very capable playing at end for the
Panthers when most of the present
undergraduates were getting into the
games on 25-cent tickets, is awarded
one end berth. Donchess excelled as
a. defensive player and allowed few
plays to travel far around his position.
Joe “Muggsy” Skladany. 0111)’ l’-W0.
years away from Alumni Hall and way-
stations, is awarded the other terminal
post. The “Baby-Faced Assassin," as
Skladany was sometimes called, did
just about everything an end could be
expected to do except cut the grass
and usher fans to their seats. Dr. Hu-
bert Wagner and Pat Herron, old-

. timers, get the second team places at

ends.

Claude Thornhill, now coach at
Stanford, was a standout performer
at tackle on the famed 1916 team.
“Tiny,” he was called, and he weighed
a mere 220 pounds. Mike Getto, All-
American in 1928, rates the other
tackle position. Mike was a good-
looking boy who also looked very’
good in the line and in the opposing
backﬁelds. Ralph Chase and Bill
Kern, now assistant varsity coach,
were the nominees for second team
berths at the tackles.

Dr. John B. Sutherland, head Pan-
ther coach, is the same John Suther-
land whose ﬁne play won him ‘all
kinds of honors at guard for Pitt.
“Jock” got off from a standing start
on his football career, but he came
forward with a rush that stamped him
as one of the best Pitt linemen in his-
tory-.- Ray Montgomery, for whom
likewise many undergraduates of to-
day sent cheers -rolling’ out of the kid
sections, is awarded the other guard
post. Ray was a-veritable destroyer

Gibby Welch, who was probably
every Pittsburgh boy's hero at some
time or other, gets the second half-
back post. Welch had some very

. great days, although there are many
, who will tell you that a trim-looking

halfback named Jimmy Hagan, now
graduate manager of athletics at ‘the
University, had a lot to do with
Gibby’s success. The late Jimmy De-
Hart is the second choice for that po-
sition.

George McLaren, a fullback- who
rode through, over, and between op-
posing l-inemen back in the lVarner
era at Pitt, gets the fullback place on
the all-time aggregation. McLaren
drilled opposing defenses with con-
siderably more destruction than he
now drills molars in his Pittsburgli
dental office. lsador Weinstock, who
donned his cap and gown only last
June and now plays for the Philadel-
phia Eagles professional team, falls
in line behind McLaren at fullback.

Both Getto and Donchess, it may be
added, are now employed as assistant
coaches. Getto is at Kansas Unive_r-
sity and Donchess is at Dartmouth.
“Muggsy” Skladany retired from pro-

Panther Eleven Prepares
For Mountaineer Invasion

West Virginia To Present Well-Balanced Team Saturday;
Emmett Moan, Soph Flash, Heads Backﬁeld List

Two up and eight to go is the way the Panther record looks at
this early date in the season as the Pitt football team prepares for the
third trap on the schedule against the West Virginia Mountaineers at
the Stadium next Saturday afternoon.

Victories over \Vaynesburg and VV&J have given the Panthers a
good start, but the eight opponents still to be met all have gridiron
grudges that they hope to settle with Pitt before the present pigskin

The West:

season comes to an end.
Virginia team, victory-less since 1928,
would like nothing better than to in-
.sert a little tragedy next Saturday in-
to the Panther camp.

Although held to a scoreless tie by
West Virginia VVesleyan team in their
-opening game, the Mountaineers dem-
onstrated last Saturday against Dav-
is and Elkins that they have “some-
thing on the ball.’’

Leading by a one touchdown margin
going into the ﬁnal quarter, the Tall-
man-coached eleven got hot and scored
twice to give them a clean-cut 20-0 vic-
tory. Two of those six-pointers came
as a result of forward passes, and the
statistics for the game show that
Vvest Virginia completed ﬁve out of
-seven p_asses during the game.

Emmett Moan, brilliant sophomore
halfback, threw both of the scoring
passes, the ﬁrst going 35 yards into
the waiting arms of Glenn Carder, the
-other being taken by Gene |Hester. Ac-
cording to advance notices, the Mount-
aineers intend to use the forward pass
weapon as often as possible on Satur-
day.

Coach Tallman, in his second year
as varsity coach, has had to rely main-
ly on sophomores and juniors this sea-
son to form his ﬁrst-string eleven. In
last Saturday’s starting lineup Tall-
man used but four seniors to ﬁll regu-
lar posts, the other seven players be-
‘ingveither juniors or sophomores.

While Coach Tallman may make a
few last-minute changes in the start-
ing lineup, it is expected that he will
use mainly the same team that started
a'ga‘ins‘t Davis & Elkins.

Herbert Barna, junior, and Angelo
Onder, brother of the former Pitt
guard, will likely start at the terminal
positions. Gene Hester, who caught
one of the touchdown passes last Sat-
urday, may edge out one of the above-
mentioned players for the starting as-
signment.

At the left tackle post, the Panther
linemen will see a very familiar face.
Big Joe Stydahar, who has been a con-
stant nemesis to both football and
basketball teams at Pitt for the past
two seasons, is winding up his third
year as a varsity regular. His run-
ning mate is Sam Mawhinney, another
veteran of two seasons.

Dave Volkin, a sophomore, and Carl
Hall, junior letterman, hold down the
guard posts, while the other member

of the center rio will be Oley Hedrick, '

a ﬁrst year luminary.

Backs Are Plentiful

Coach Tal1man’s starting backﬁeld
quartet against the Scarlet lHurricane
was made up of Bob Kyle, at quarter,
Glenn Carder and Red Gocke, at
halves, and Joe Za-leski at fullback.
However during last Saturday’s strug-
gle, Tallman made frequent substitu-
tions among the backs, using a pair of
sophomore speed stars, Moan, and
Isaac, for the halfback replacements.

Moan especially will‘ bear watching
in the coming games because of his
brilliant play against Davis and Elk=
ins. Leo ‘Fizer, another sophomore,
saw plenty of service at fullback, top-
ping off his day's work with a 21-yard
run for the .third Mountaineer touch-
down. .- .

While there were still a few ﬂaws
to be found in -the Panther’s perform-
anceagainst the Presidents, the im-
provement shown in ’Saturday’s en-
counter was very noticeable and the
West Virginia game will offer an op-
portunity of putting on a dress rehear-
sal prior to the Notre Dame game on
October 19.

Virtually every Panther player who
made the trip to Washington got in
the game. The work of the sopho-
mores contributed a lot to the Panther
success at W. & J. With the excep-
tion of Rector’s plunge for a six-point-
er, every other point was made by a
ﬁrst-year player. Patrick's 22 points,
as a result of three touchdowns, a
ﬁeld goal, and an extra point, together
with his eight tallies against Waynes-
burg gives him a commanding lead for
district scoring honors. While not
classiﬁed "as a sophomore, Johnny
Wood is playing his ﬁrst season of var-
sity competition. He and sophomore
Johnny Dollgert got together for the
ﬁnal six points, Dougert tossing 9.’ lat-
eral to Wood/for t-he score. , _ ,

At quarterback Michelosen did a
nice piece of work at directing the
plays, and Frank Souchak spilled
many a President during his after-
noon’s work.

The Pitt eleven will probably lineup
against the Mountaineers with the
same team that started against Wash-
Jeff.

Boxers Begin Training
Drills In YMHA Gym

Facing the hardest schedule ever
arranged for a Pitt boxing team, the
1935-36 mittmen began pre-season
drills yesterday in their new head-
quarters at the YM-YWHA well-
equipped gymnasium.

According to Head Coach Jack
Schricker the 50 aspirants compose an
enthusiastic and promising squad. It
will be a week or more before the
boys ‘don the gloves and engage in
actual work-outs. At present they
are merely loosening up those muscles
and drilling in fundamentals.

The 145-pound and 165-pound divi-
sions constitute Schricker’s greatest
problem-. Minus the services of
Veterans Bernie Spiegal and hard-
hitting Joe Kopp, the pugilistic
H1911?-01,’ Will have to groom new men
for these important varsity positions.

Fraternity Men
To ‘Rush’ Again
In Panther Run

Greeks will “rush” Friday in the
Panther Run in order to ﬁll that
empty spot on the mantle with another
shining cup and also to carry Alpha
Beta’s colors past No Man’s Land.

Martin J. Feely, Director of intra-
mural athletics, announces tnat both
individual awards and a team trophy
will be presented to the leaders in this
opening event on the Intramural pro-
gram.

The race will start promptly at -1
c’c1ock, VVLLU. the runners lining up
for the mile climb at the taxi stand
on Bigelow Boulevard and Fifth Ave-
nue. Originally, the course circled
the Cathedral before passing up Bigo-
low Boulevard. However, this ﬁrst
half mile has been cut so as to
shorten the race for the novice coin-
petitors. A

At the red light near the foot of
State Hall hill, the course takes a
sharp turn to the left, continuing up
De Sota Street to the Y Hut. Here,
the route leaves the streets for the
path leading to the Dental School at
the horseshoe curve on University
Drive. ‘ 

For the ﬁrst time during the run,
the hill-climbers hit the down-grade
trail to ﬁnish on the Alumni Hall
ramp. The entire ‘race covers ap-
proximately one mile and a quarter.

Entry blanks have been mailed out
to all fraternity groups. Individual
entries should be turned in to Feely
athis '-I‘rees Gymnasium office. An
entry blank appears on another part
of this page.

Touch Football Entries Duc

VVith Touch Football opening Mou-
day, Feely urges the groups to ﬁle
team entries, immediately, either in
Room" 801-, Cathedral, or in his Tree’s
Gymnasium ofﬁce.

Greek entries will be handled
through the Interfrat.ernit_v Athletic
committee composed of Harry Zinsser,
Med:-‘,8, and William Housel, C37.

‘Watching Pitt Foes

W'ith but one exception, all future
Pitt football opponents this season
came through their respective tests
last week-end with victories. The
fact that two of these teams engaged
each other made a clean sweep im-
possible.

Notre Dame and Carnegie Tech
fought it out on the Stadium ﬁeld,
with the Irish coming from behind in
the second half to win, 14-3. Tech
led at the half by virtue of Kopcsak’s
field goal, but the Notre Dame attack
started to click in the third period
and that meant the ball game..

West Virginia showed considerable
improvement over the. form shown in
its opening game by -overpowering
Davis and Elkins, 20-0.

Penn State came through on a last-
minute play to score the touchdown
which defeated Lebanon Valley, 12-6.
The Lions looked very tame and
frightened until a fourth-quarter rally
saw them 'tie the game and ﬁnally
forge ahead.

Fordham continued merrily on its
way by smacking out a 19-0 victory
over Boston College.

Army brought its guns in range
for the ﬁrst time this season to knock
over William and Mary, 14‘-'0. It is
reported that the Army boys had a
much tougher time of it than they had
anticipated.

Nebraska's Cornhuskers whipped
Iowa State, 20-7, to score their ﬁrst
triumph in the Big Six conference
this season.» Sam Francis, big Husker
fullback, stole some of the show from
Lloyd Cardwell, but that .worthy
came through with a 51-yard touch-
down run to keep up his average.

Southern California's Trojan war-
horse snapped out of its ‘ﬁrst game
canter and galloped to a 19-7 victory
over College of the Paciﬁc. The Tro-
jans were behind, 7-6, at the half,
but superior power ﬁnally won the
day.

Milligan’s Light, Fast Yearlings
Prepare For Tech Battle

Coach Mike Milligan’s frosh eleven
will open the 1935 season playing the
Carnegie Tech plebes in the Tech
bowl at 10 »o’clock Saturday morning.

Aiming to get off to a fast start,

Mike Milligan, who replaced “Skip”
Gougler as coach of the freshman
grid team,will present his -strongest
lineup. With an average ofbut 177
pounds, the little Panthers will pre-
sentone of the lightest frosh teams
in IPi'tt"s history. _ '
, At the terminal posts, Coach Mil-
ligan_ will use ‘Charles Fleming, 159-
pound kgwingman _, from New Castle,
and Fabian Hoffman, 175-pounder,
from Pittsburgh. A pair of husky
boys will hold down the tackle posi-
tion in Ben Asuntch, 190-pound star
from Wilkes Barre, and Bi-ll M.erkov-
sky, 187, former Scott High School
star. Two 180-pound men hold down
the guard posts in Stephen Petro,
Johnstown, and Walt Ra.skoski, New
Castle. At the pivot position will be
Bob Dannies, 185-pounder from Wan-
watosa, Wisconsin.

The starting backﬁeld is light but
shifty, averaging but 175 pounds.
Heading the list of ball carriers is
Marshall "Goldberg, triple threat back
from Elkins, West Virginia, 165
pounds. Teaming up with Goldberg,
at the other halfback post is Hal
Stebbins, 178, former Williamsport
High School star. Signal calling will
be done by Clement Cambul, who tips
the scales at 174 pounds. _ John
Chickerneo, 185-pound star from War-
ren, will‘ handle the fullback duties.

Meet ‘Scotty’, The Gentleman
Who Gets l__(_'_<:1_1_i°_‘Gym’ Basket

Knives, Carving Form Chief Hobbies For Popular
Custodian Of Towels, Shirts, And Shorts

By Edwin H. Beachlcr
All the ‘gym boys‘ know “Scotty,”

but few know him as Mr. John Scott;

yet this Mr. Scott is the same
“Scotty" who handles all the boys’
baskets, gym equipment, and even

their candy bars.

Between handing out footballs, run-
ning for baskets, distributing equip-
ment, and acting the salesman.
“Scotty" takes great pleasure in re-
calling his past experiences. “Scotty"
at one time was a school teacher in
a “little red school house” in one of
the rural districts in northern Penn-
sylvania, later worked in a steel mill
in Pittsburgh, and came to the Uni-
versity as custodian when the Trees
Gymnasium was opened.

Besides taking great pride in his
work, “Scotty” also has a peculiar
fascination for knives. Just to feel
the tug of his 35-year-old Dcarhorn
as it swings back and forth in his
shiny blue serge gives him the urge
to Whittle something. Today, the
Dearhorn handle is worn smooth, per-
haps due to whittling.

“Scotty” also has another hobby,
that of carving. Now to carve a vio-
li11 (he has completed three of these)
he likes toruse the white knife given
to him by a son. It was a product of
the Yosemite valley. Only recently,
he pulled it out from behind the sec-
ond row of lockers after a year's ab-

sence. » -

even carved the ﬁngerboard and scroll
and peg-box.

“Scotty” possesses a total of ﬁve
knives. XVith these he has produced
three violins, several necklaces turned
out on single pieces of wood, and one
caged ball from a solid block. His
turning blocks are the ﬁnest of their
kind, he proudly exclaims.

An 80-year-old violin is played by
a son who performs in the Allegheny
High School orchestra. Olive. his
eldest daughter, who was just 16
years old last March, is a sophomore
in the College with a "B" average.
A son nine years of age is the young-
est, and another daughter is in grade
school in Allegheny.

“Scotty’s” chief ambition at the
present time is to curve a viola and
to add to his knife collection.

WSGA To Open
Meetings To All
Women Students

Commission To Publish Agenda;
Women Of Faculty Invited
To November Gathering

IVVSGA commission meetings will
be hereafter open to all women stu-
dents on campus, Ruth Anderson,
C36, president of the association, an-
nounced today.

The new policy of open meetings
was decided upon at a recent meeting
of the VVSGA commission, governing
body of Women’s activities. As an-
other innovation in WSGA meetings
this year, an agenda, patterned after
that of SFA and containing all points
of interest to be discussed by the
commission, will be issued previous to

the meetings and will be posted on
the VVSGA bulletin board.

To interest more women on the
faculty in the activities of the organ-
ization and to encourage them to use
their voting privileges as members of
VVSGA, the commission will entertain
women faculty members and admin-
istration officers at an informal din-
ner. The dinner will precede the
regular meeting of the commission on
Thursday, November 16, in the Heinz
House.

After a lapse of two years, Officers’
Night will be resumed this year ac-
cording to Miss Helen P. Rush, as-
sistant to the dean of women and fac-
ulty adviser of WSGA. Oﬂicers, chair-
men, and committee members of
campus organizations will meet on
Tuesday evening, October 16, to dis-
cuss student activities. Separate
meetings will be held for men and
women. ,

The next meeting of the commission.
the ﬁrst to which all women students
and faculty members have been in-
vited to attend, will be held on No-
vember 16 in the Heinz House.

Watkins I Evades
Fall Hay Fever
In Bermuda Trip

Ralph J. Watkins, director of the
Bureau of Business Research, re-
turned Saturday to the University
from Bermuda. The trip was an at-
tempt on the director’s part to avoid
his annual case of hay-fever. l\Ir.
Watkins stated that he had a very
pleasant voyage, led a simple life and
that the trip was successful from the
hay-fever viewpoint. He was accom-
panied by his wife and two-and-a-haltl
year-old son.

Concerning life on the island, VVat-
kins said it was comparable to the
slow easy life of the southern states
in the past century. Food must be
imported and as a result the cost of
living is rather high. Watenmust be
obtained by catching the rain water
in specially constructed cisterns on
the roof of each house. To increase
the purity of the water the roof is
made of coral stone and white-
washed. Some of the leading hotels
have laid off whole ‘hillsides 111 a
similar manner. The rainfall aver-
ages about 50 inches a year,_thereby
making this method convenient for
the natives.

Tourist trade is the main business
on the island, and flourishes chieﬂy
in the winter. Transportation is an
experience in itself, claims Dr. Wat-
kins. Only government automobiles
are- allowed on the -island, making it

 

 

1iecessary',fo"rIthe residents to travel ,-

either by bi_cycle_or carriage-

Dr. Watkins‘ ’p-robably thought he
returned -too soon, when snow fell here
Sunday‘ afternoon. '
