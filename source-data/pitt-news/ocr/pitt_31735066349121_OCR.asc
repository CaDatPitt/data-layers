Cost-Cut Plans Implemente

BY GENE GRABOWSKI

Five of 13 cost-cutting recom-
mendations for Pitt made public
recently by the Governor’s Man-
agement Review Team are in either
partial or total implementation,
according to an ofﬁcial response
made by the Chancellor’s office
yesterday.

The Chancellor’s response, in
the form of a press release, said
Pitt was already in the process of

2 reorganizing the physical plant and _

purchasing departments, reducing
costs of copying services and of the
University Press, and minimizing
lighting costs.

According to the review team’s

ﬁndings made public last week, V.

total savings for the University
after full implementation of only
these ﬁve recommendations would
amount to $492,000.

The Chancellor’s release, how-
ever, said the ﬁgures given by the
review team were approximations.

“We believe the dollar, ﬁgures
assigned in the study are rough
estimates,” the release said.
“(The ) represent in some cases,

     

goals rather than immediate dollar
savings.”

The Chancellor’s statement did‘

not say to what extent any or all of
the implemented suggestions were
being carried out.

Two of the review team’s
recommendations are dependent
upon negotiations between Pitt and
a third party or separate corpora-
tions, the release also said.

The merging" of Pitt’s Titusville
campus with Clarion State
College's Venango campus and a
reduction in storehouse inventory

—offering a savings totaling
$300,000, according to the review
team’s study—were cited as the
items under discussion between
Pitt and other parties.

The review team’s remaining
recommendations for improved
dormitory security, the establish-
ment of a University consulting
service corporation, the implemen-
tation of a University Health
Services corporation, and the
formation of a steering service
committee to monitor Pitt’s com-

RSA Eyes Security

BY JENNY SCHUELER

A new dorm-security plan
involving a no-escort-for-residents
policy, student marshals and
structural changes was approved
tentatively by the Resident Student
Association (RSA) atits meeting

That furry little fellow you sometimes see scurrying along
the lawn behind the Cathedral was caught savoring a bit of food”by
Pitt News Photo editor Rich Wilson. I

Livewire: Ombudsman Solves Problems  

Monday.

The plan is a modiﬁcation of one
proposed by Student Government
Board member Chip Hubbard.

Under the plan, a resident of the
Towers who wished to visit a friend
in another Tower would enter the
building upon telephone conﬁrma-
tion from the room he intended to
visit. Non-residents still would

‘have to be escorted and residents

would be prohibited from signing
in anyone they did not know.

“This will be stated as a’ deﬁnite
policy,” RSA chairperson Marty
Doerﬂer said, though he added
there is no way of enforcing it at
present. _

The duties of student marshals
would include assisting security
"desk personnel and checking ﬁre
extinguishers and safety equip-
ment. Student marshals would
patrol the halls on a rotating basis
to check security locks on stairwell
doors and report suspicious per-
sons. ., A
“What’s beingsuggested is a
constant flow of motion,’ ’ RSA Vice
Chairperson Tamar Baum said.
She added that a student marshal
could be “jumped” and therefore
marshals would be required to
work in pairs.

Doerflerdiscussed the possiblity
that student marshal jobs could be
funded through the Work-Study
Ofﬁce. “The problem is, if you’ve
got a test to study for they can’t
make you come to work,” he said.

Another alternative ‘ was the

For Oakland ‘Mess’

Br GREG RINGELING

Area businessmen have no
knowledge of the 2,000-name
petitions calling for cleanup of litter
on Oakland sidewalks collected by
the South Oakland Citizens Council
(SOCC). ‘

Most agreed there is a litter
problem stemming from the
fast-food shops, but few felt that a

Change  

of funding through either source
have not been worked out.

Alex Nuccetelli, McCormick Hall
representative, said he will draw
up a proposal for structural
changes to present to the Security
Committee of the Office of
Residence Life. 

Changes proposed are separate

entrances to Towers A, B and C

from the main Towers lobby, with a
security desk at each entrance.
Nuccetelli said the individual

Towers’ lobbies, used to get to the‘

cafeteria, allow non-residents en-
trance to the buildings.
He also propsed using the locked

Kﬁre doors outside the cafeteria as

entrances. directly from the street,
as well as a passage_ from the
mailroom to -the main Towers
Lobby. Nuccetelli said he would
like to see the main lobby or street
entrances be the only way into the

— cafeteria.

“As it stands now, the buildings
are still open 14 hours a day. Any
Tom, Dick or Harry can come
walking in and walk right out
again,” Nuccetelli said.

Another aspect of the plan is
guest passes for non-resident
visitors. The pass would be an
alternative form of identiﬁcation
for visiting non-students. Whether
students still would have to be
escorted or whether the pass would
allow them to move freely was not
decided at the meeting.

door between Towers B and C be

BY GEORGENE KALEINA

Students wrestling-with problems resulting from the
University’s bureaucracy have an outlet through which to
release their frustrations and possibly obtain a solution.

Gripes ranging from regis_tration to late fees have been
handled through the University Ombudsman Leland
Deck’s ofﬁce. Even though it isonly a one-man ofﬁce,
Deck h_as had favorable results with many students.

P ‘_‘I have seen about 1,500 students this term,” Deck said.
“Of this number, I resolved at least one problem of about
60% of them.” . . . . . ‘

Deck said‘ he could not help about 20% and ‘tried and
failed with the other 20%. .

Deck maintains an unstructured‘ office. with no records‘

and he feels it is because of this that he can help the
students. ‘‘I have no written authority from above and I
operate without instructions’ and restrictions,” Deck said.‘

“I think the lack of instructions and restrictions enables me ,.

to move more freely for the students.”
Deck said any student can approach him with .a problem
and if there is any chance to help the student he’ll try.
“The big problem with helping the students is not with
the students. but with the interpretations of the rules,”

Deck said. “University employes are doing‘ their job with a -

set of written instructions and they feel they can’t bend to
any individual.” ' ' ' ’ 2 ‘ _
“It is my job to see if something can bedone to help with

”_v'.-the individual problem,” Deck said. . ,
M Deck has access to records and information that students ‘
, cannot see. “Because of this, Ican help students who get

an unequitable treatment in an organized institution" that is
run by written instructions,” Deck said. “I have never
been turned down for facts." - ’

Deck .views himself not as counselor but as an —
A “ambassador”-or‘a‘ “ﬁxer-upper” for the students. “Ican

go to the head of the department to ﬁnd out _.what went

unlocked was discarded.

“Can we legitimately violate
Tower B’s security this way?”
Doerﬂer asked. He said if students
could enter freely through the door,
they would not need telephone
conﬁrmation to enter the other
tower.

“People coming through unes-
corted would defeat the purpose of
the security desk,” added Andy
Levino, a Tower B representative.

The proposed security plan
added that campus police patroling
of Towers’ halls should continue
and that the security ID pass ‘for
Tower residents should be elimin-
ated.

Subject to changes in wording,
the dorm-security plan will be
finalized by the RSA this week and
submitted to. the Office of
Residence Life. ‘

In other action, the RSA afﬁrmed
its opposition to moving the pinball

machines from the main Towers’
lobby to the individual lobbies. of
Tower A, B and C.

“We don’t care to supervise the
pinball machines,” Brackenridge
Hall representative Wayne Goet-
lich said. “It’s not our responsi-
bility.’’

Other RSA members cited the
security risks of having the pinball
machines in three poorly super-
vised places and said there have
been complaints about noise and
non-residents using the machines.

Doerﬂer said discussions with
Director of Residence Life Fred
Fonseca had produced no results.
“Mr. Fonseca stated his decision
would not be reversed without
intervention from his superiors,”
Doerﬂer said. _

RSA Communications" Coordin-
ator Bill Voharas proposed taking
the matter directly to the Student
Affairs Advisory Committee

(SAAC).

The drive has received the-
support of the Chancellor’s ofﬁce,
Student Government, Black Action
Society, and the Panhellenic
Society, he said.

Friday night a kick-off dance,
sponsored by IFC and the Resident
Student Association, is scheduled
in the Student Union Ballroom.
Riefenstahl said students will be
admitted to the disco-type dance by
contributing a food item worth 50
cents or more at the door, along
with a free ticket, available at the
Student Union Ticket Ofﬁce and
the main Towers lobby.

A $200 award has been offered
by the IFC to the group collecting
the highest monetary amount of
food. Reifenstahl said for a group
to win the $200, which will be
drawn from the IFC budget, they
must turn in the food on Thursday,

“These services have been and

that total implementation of these
latter recommendations will be
infeasible.”

Two of the review team’s

the release noted. Computerized
student health accounts and

been in effect since summer.

According to the review team’s

 artistic centers of the United States and Canada, including Joseph

. Letter

  The Right-to-Cho

~*Sabrina Sigal’s October 1 letter

‘ . attacked a previous pro-life article

(“Murder by Any Other Name,”

--  September_ 24) for alleged non-
.-factual presumptions—well, it cer-,

tainly could not have contained"

~more misinformation than several

recent letters to the Pitt News.

To begin with Sigal’s letter, no
medical authority has ever denied

. that the unborn child is alive;

rather, the semantic quibbling

'7 arises ‘over what constitutes a

human being. But that is no longer
an issue, for the Supreme Court
has made it quite clear that
humanness is a question of

j- geography: once a child takes that

magic voyage ex utero, the United
States government will condescent
to accept that the baby is a human
being. I further suggest that Bill
Kalman (October 10) investigate
recent psychological and biological
‘literature on the prenatal period of
life. The unborn child is indeed
“experiencing” the world of the
womb, as prenatal memories amply
demonstrate—you have to be alive

, to perceive. However, if we accept

Linda Zingarelli’s contention
"(October 13) that the baby is only
human after the 12th week, then
what are we to make of the current
legal situation which allows a
physician to kill the nine-month-old
child while the mother is in labor?
' Whenever the continuation of a

'womam

pregnancy endangered the life of a
the ancient right of
self-defense made abortion’ legal!
even before the high court's
decision in Roe v. Wade. That
decision, incidently, is very much
like the Dred‘Scott decision of over
a century ago: the courtsimply
deﬁned a portion of the human race
as non-persons so that they could
be treated as chattel.

Further, birth control is not
inconsistent with the pro-life

position. It is quite one thing to-

prevent conception and the begin-
ning of a human life; it is quite
another to kill a human being once
that life has begun. Siga1’s allusion
to the Talmud is indeed unfortun-
ate, for apparently she has not read

.the whole text. It is the Sanhedrin

which unequivocally states that the
human being is ensouled at
conception. Moreover, the great
Alexandrine Jewish philosopher,
Philo, said the unborn child is “like
few other “logical” beliefs.

Finally, if Dan Mulholland has
no right to freely express his ideas
because he is a male, then Kalman
has pre-ernpted his own argu-
ments. As for Zingarelli’s
argument that “logical thinking’ ’ is
a criterion for humanness, then I
suggest that the vast_majority of
‘the people on this planet are not
human. Concerning her “better
dead than unwanted” philosophy,

perhaps Zingarelli should talk to

If nothing else, the Bicentennial
has provided television with an
excuse to produce a whole series of
specials and spectaculars designed
to capture the American mind. But
there is one major network (which
will remain anonymous) that is
outproducing the others. Somehow
this network has gotten hold of a
time machine and has sent a
prominent sports producer (and
crew) back to 1776 to ﬁlm an
historical spectacle, the Battle of
Trenton. —

The time is Christmas morning,
1776. The producer is busyptry-ing
"to find a way to get hisvcameras
across the Delaware to film
Washington himself stepping out
onto the Jersey shore.

General Washington, however, has
other ideas.

“I’m sorry, Mr. A, but I cannot
give you any boats for your
contraptions. I need them all to
transport my men. Just what do
those things do anyway?”

“They take pictures, General.
We are going to preserve you for
posterity. Now how about if they
just ride along with some of your
men. It will be a little crowded, but

the ghost of Joseph McCarthy for a
a statue lying in a sculptor’s
workshop, requiring nothing more
than to be released into the world.”

The pro-life position is relatively
simple: it is no more just ‘to
discriminateon the basis of age
and size than it is for sex, race,
religion or class. The unborn child-
is biologically alive, and unques-
tionably homo sapiens. Those who
wish to introduce other criteria for
humanness, or the relative value of
human beings, can join the ranks of
all the other racists, sexists and
sundry bigots of history—they will
be in the famous company of Hitler
and present federal government of
the United States. If it is not
genocide, then why are more black
children being murdered than
white? Simple: it is easier (and
more expensive) to kill the poor
than feed them. As usual, the
government does not attack the
disease of poverty, but rather its
victims. In refugee camps around
the nation, frightened and con-
fused Vietnamese’ women are being
coerced into submitting to the

destruction of their unborn children

because we all know how danger-

ous these non-WASP foreigners

might be. When are the anti-life
people going to realize that the
right--to-choose is quickly becoming
the order-to-kill? —

This question settled, the pro-

gram opens with a drum role and a"

commercial for Bicentennial beer.
Scene 1: The camera pans the
ﬂotilla crossing the river. Cut to a
closeup of Washington’s boat.
Producer: — “Hold everything;
Now General, what kind of pose is
that being slouche_d against the
back of the boat? Is that how you
want future generations to remem-
ber you?”
A “But it’s cold, and very windy!”
“Never mind that, you should be
standing at‘ the front of the boat
striking a regal pose. Brave the
wind, put your hand in your coat

“Never mind. Just turn these
boats around and let’s try it

again.”

Producer: “Okay, let’s stop once
more. Look, General, this whole
operation went too smoothly. How
do you expect people to believe the
whole crossing took place without
some kind of accident? Now why
don’t we have those two boats
rammed and capsized by chunks of
ice.”

“Sir, I am a general. This is my
army. We have just completed a
successful crossing and we are due
in Trenton by sunrise. How can I

carry on my war if you keep

“I’m sorry, General, but that
just doesn’t cut any meat with me.

fought without hardships. Think of

Letter

The ﬂotilla

In the October 22 issue of the Pitt"
News, an obviously ignorant
person wrote in about how Pitt’s’
“Golden Girls” didn’t look very
impressive on the football ﬁeld.

Is this person an expert in the art
of dancing or baton twirling?
Anyone who has ever twirled a
baton, who watches the girls
perform, knows that the routines
are extremely difficult. Larry Cervi
demands a great deal from these
girls and they do the best they can.

What else can be asked of them?
As former high school majorettes,
we can appreciate the talent of
Pitt’s majorettes. We, too, were at
tryouts and there is no doubt in our
minds that Jacqueline Scott was by
far the best qualified for the
opening.

cameras get several great actions‘

shots of boats capsizing, and of
attempted rescues. Sixteen men
are killed. Camera focuses on first
boats touching shore.

Producer: “All right, all right,
stop the action. General, how can
you let half your army come ashore
before you? Now I want your boat
to be the ﬁrst to land. And try to be
a little more inspiring. Give us a
dramatic quote, like McArthur’s ‘I
shall return.’ Remember, you will‘
be seen by millions of Americans.

“l’1l tell you what, General.
We’ll make it easierfor you. Just
have all your boats row back to a
point about 20 feet from the shore.
Then, the only thing you’ll have to
do‘ over is the landing, with you
stepping out first.”

General steps out and mutters
“Let’s get going, dammit.” The

them at various poses. A scout
rides up to Washington. ‘

“Excuseme, General, but ‘I’ve
just spotted several hundred
Hessians marching in this direc-
tion. They’ll be here in less than an

“But how did they find out
where we are or what we were

General, but I sent one of my men

Right to Strike—
A Needed Evil

It was with great irritation that I
read Cal Ritchey’s article con-
demning the American Federation
of Government Employes for its
recent requests for the right to
strike and for independent (of
Congress) consideration for cost of
living adjustments.

. Ritchey’s remarks are indicative
of an ignorance not only of the facts
surrounding the federal employ-
ees’ efforts to get their recom-

mended raises, but of the nature of

negotiation.

The President's pay compara-
bility panel was established in
order to make analyses of changes
in the cost of living, and the
resultant changes in the pay
practices of industry. These
analyses were to be used in
determining each year’s cost of

living adjustment for the federal
employes.

During 1974, for example, the
panel concluded that the cost of
living had increased to roughly
12%. When making their recom-
mendation to the Congress, how-
ever, they opted for a lower figure,
7.22%, so that the raise would not
be “inﬂationary.” The President
lowered this recommendation to
5%, so that is what was
implemented. This year, as Ritchey
points out, the board recommended
8.66%, and the adjustment that
was given was 5%.,The effect of
these reductions on the buying
power of the federal employes has
been signiﬁcant at all levels.

As to Ritchey’s assertion that
giving the federal employes the
right to strike would preclude “real
negotiations,” I suggest that he
review the meaning of the word
“negotiation.” In order to have
true negotiations, both sides must

. have a point of strength from which

to bargain. The government
employes" have only one, at
present, and that is the voting bloc.

ﬁllIIllllllllllllllllllllllll

Ritchey termed this “blackmail,"
but without it, the employes have
no strength whatever.

The right to strike is a needed
evil. Whether “management” is
Ebenezer Scrooge, or the Presi-
dent, employes can never be
treated justly when their advance-
ment comes at the unilateral whim
of management.

Where Heroes Still Triumph

and chatted with the two bigger
men over a cup of coffee. It seemed
like backstage at the theatre.

Next came the
Waldo von Erich and Baron Mikel
Scicluna, whom the fans detest and
boo endlessly. Von Erich, the
European champion, was smiling
pleasantly. I asked myself, “Why
does he look so nasty during the

match?” Ileft that unanswered for.

I began to wonder if the German
helmet and swagger stick he sports
during matches were in the valise
he was carrying. ,

Meanwhile Scicluna, from the
Isle of Malta, was already in a bout
with a coffee machine that wouldn’t
take his quarter. I thought he was
going to smash the machine to
pieces. Undoubtedly he could have.
But he calmly kept trying, gave up
and, smiling at an usher, walked
away, pufﬁng on his pipe.

A re_al sponge for knowledge, I
had to explore further. Isnuck past
the guard and into the locker room.

That turned out to be a no-no,_

     
    
        

however, and I got bounced right
away. “You no allowed in here,”

‘ said Miller with his Italian accent.

“I give you ticket for you to sit, so
you sit.”

As Ihead for my seat through the
.Arena’s make-shift protective tun-
nel for visiting hockey players, I
wondered if 600-pound “Hay-
stacks” Calhoun was going to fit
through without widening it.
Maybe they led him through

_ sideways.

While awaiting the opening
match, I observed the crowd. To
put it bluntly, there were a lot of
strange-looking people. A wrest-
ling crowd is comparable to that of
a carnival—a lot of weirdos. Maybe
I was one of them.

The ﬁrst bout put “Fabulous”
Frank Monte against Manuel Soto.
Monte became “Fabulous” when
he dyed his thick hair and matching
beard from black to gold. Down for
the count when the bell rang,

~ Monte claimed he was the victor

and received a round of jeers when
he finally got up.

 

The most difficult thing about
wrestling matches for “Haystacks”
Calhoun is squeezing through the
protective tunnel to reach the ring.

DeFazio pinned “The Mad Execu-
tioner,” who is listed as being from
Parts Unknown, in the .second
event though The Executioner tried
to slug DeFazio with the ringside
announcer’s microphone. DeFazio
grabbed the mike and banged his
masked opponent’s head against it
and the bout was all over. As The
Executioner was leaving the ring,
he was attacked by a man from the
crowd who was carted away by
four policemen. I figured it was
part of the show. . I

Calhoun outweighed Mulligan
by 326 pounds. It seemed the two

ring than in, and, as a result, both
were disqualiﬁed, but not before
Calhoun was bloodied by a severe
cut—was it real?—on his forehead

missing—the smile he wore in the

Sammartino with his swagger stick
when the match began, but
Sammartino rebounded to take
control.

Then with Sammartino lying ﬂat
on his back, von Erich attempted. to
jump on him from the very top
turnbuckle. But he'didn’t expect
Sammartino to move, and when he
landed, he severely wrenched his
knee. Sammartino worked over the
knee until submission. He once
again had defended his title and
the crowd loved it. It seemed no

Buggsie McGraw, an ex-convict
considered one of the most
dangerous men in the world. He
once crawled underneath the ring,
stuck his head out and started
barking, so you can see the sort of
character he is. Television an-

nouncer Vince McMahon, Jr., once '

said .McGraw possessed “the body

And there's George “The

body also resembles a gorilla’-s. He
often wags his tongue while
screaming at the crowd and once
chewed up a turnbuckle and spit
the padding all over the ring.
McMahon often says he and
McGraw are “notplaying with a

Steele is actually a physical
education teacher in a suburban
Michiganhigh school. .
But not everyone in pro wrestling
is a villian. Known as “The Living

Legend,” Sammartino is one of the"

world’s most beloved athletes.
With an enormous following, he
has held the World Wide Wrestling
Federation title for 10 of the last 13
years. Many people think it will be
a miracle, ‘though, if he survives
through the end of the year.

Born in Abruzzi, Italy, Sammar-

tino has adopted Pittsburgh as his-

hometown. Because of his vast
popularity and drawing power.
Sammartino earns $100,000 per
year in pro wrestling, andhigh
ﬁve-ﬁgure salaries for his oppon-
ents are not unusual.

Elton John Fills
Album with
  Top-4OHits

BY TOM WASELESKI

Ro_ck of the Westies, Elton _John.
MCA Records, MCA-2163.

Elton John has really bit the dust
this time. , After a string of
artistically depraved albums, Rock
of the Westies does practically
nothing to recapture the musician’s
former self.

His last album, Captain Fantas-
tic and the Brown-Dirt Cowboy,
was an autobiographical sketch on
how tough it is to make it to the top.
Rock of the Westies shows us how
easy it is to slide back to the
bottom.

The record reeks of Top-40 music
that’s only thinly veiled by
five-minute time lengths and
supposedly rich lyrical characteri-
zations. This stuff’s for the
teenies, where I suppose he
supposes the money is these days.

It’s hard to believe this guy once
sang about madmen and highways
and social pariahs.’ Now he takes to
the disco sound and all the cornball
lyrics that allow you to be removed
enough to dance, only dance to his
stuff.

Speaking of “Philadelphia Free-
dom,” the first single off this
album is “Island Girl,” a mundane
tune that’ll be wearing away the
gym ﬂoors in high schools and
junior highs all across the country.

A real joke is the album opener,
“Medley (Yell Help, Wednesday
Night, Ugly).” What most.
songwriters call a change in time,
Elton John calls a medley. He
should know better. ,

eye around and around. When the
manipulation breaks off at the
canvas’ edge, one is left staring at
the museum wall.

Perhaps the most intriging of the
optical illusions is created by Babe
Shapiro’s “Some Heartwork.”
From a “head on” perspective,
varying degrees of dusky tones
regress towards the center of— the
work. The artist then switches to

From an angle, the ~— window
becomes elongated, forming a door

This work seems to be a favorite
fascination among viewers. Even
the museum guards join in pointing
out its peculiar perspective quality.

Garfunkel Back in

BY TOM WASELESKI

Breakaway, Art Garfunkel.

Col bia, PC 33700.

 

 

 

Since Paul Simon and Art
Garfunkel split in 1970, in much the
same way the Beatles did, at their
peak, rumors have ﬂown as to
when the reunion would come (as
if indeed it would).

If recent activities of the
estranged duo can serve as any
indication of what lies ahead, we
might expect that reunion in no
time at all. When both release
their latest solo albums on the
same day, cut a single as “Simon
and Garfunkel” that appears on
both albums, and turn up at each
other’s concerts to do a short spot
of their stuff from the good ol’
days, it’s hard to tell if there’s any
split at all.

While most fans anxiously await
total reconciliation, ie, an. album
with both of them the whole way
through, others may be content

With associations thus blocked, the
mind is left to wonder—what else is
there then?

Though the bulk of the show
consists of paintings, the few
sculpture pieces hold their own.
Sam Ogden’s untitled shiny steel
band performs a sculptural dance.
The piece is simple but alive with
movement. It would dance off its
marble stage were it not tightly
anchored.

Sound and action are stimulated
by Katzen’s untitled two-piece
ﬂoor sculpture. Partly rolled slabs
of iron are seemingly suspended in
the act of rumbling across the
exhibition_ ﬂoor. The size and

organic qua_lity of its material

 

further ‘evoke mighty power and
eruptibility.

An interesting contrast is pro-
vided by Harry Bertola’s “Dande-
lion.” The work is large (eight feet
tall) butstands as light as air in" its
full, feathery bloom. The seeming
softness of the sculpture invites
tactile examination as visual

observation belies its steel .Con- J

struction. .

. This is a living collection. A few
of the works are soiled from serving
as ofﬁce decor. Instead of spoiling
the pieces, the ﬁngermarks serve
as intimate proof of living
interaction. .

The pieces are singularly exhi-
bited in ofﬁces around Pittsburgh.
For a time, they have been
gathered together for public
viewing.

The public needs to have its
senses vibrated from the exciting
input.

with the way things are now. After
all, there’s twice as much material
being put out, and almost all of it is
good.

‘Garfunkel’s latest, Breakaway, is
a tremendous followup to his ﬁrst
solo record, the sugary and at times
archaic Angel Clare.

Produced by Richard Perry
(mastermind behind Carly Simon
and Ringo Starr masterpieces), the
album is sophisticated in its layers
of instrumentation. Sometimes
bold and brassy, other times sleek
and stringy, Perry has another
winner on his hands. '

A Stevie ~ Wonder song, “I
Believe (When IF all in Love It Will

- Be Forever),” opens the album

with a good example of Garfunkel’s
seriousness this time around.
Bearing no soulful mark on it, just
the essence of Wonder’s ability to
capture elegant melodies, the song
lets Garfunkel’s voice pass through
like sunlight on crystal. An
‘arrangement of piano, both
straight and electric, and smooth
strings leads Artie along till some
warm female voices and a
Harrison-type guitar bring this to a
strong ﬁnish. .
The title cut is backed by
Graham Nash, David Crosby and
Toni T ennille, as if it would make a
difference—their voices blend so
homogeneously that it doesn’t. A
good song .just the same.
Two haunting pieces, “Waters of
March” and “99 Miles from LA,”
take us back to the Sixties a bit.

‘Godspell’ Bursts with  

Joyous Creativespirit

BY DAVID ASHLEY

Godspell, the immensely suc-
cessful rock musical in its ﬁfth year
on Broadway, is the current
offering of Camelot Productions at
the Plaza Theatre in Bloomﬁeld.
The play, conceived by John-
Michael Tebelek with music by
Stephen Schwartz (both,, inciden-
tally, graduates of_ Carnegie-
Mellon Univeristy), dramatizes
what the author considers the
central’ aspects of Christ's message
as reported by the apostle
Matthew, with some borrowing
from the gospels of Luke and John.

The word “Godspell” is the Old
English form of “gospel” and was
selected intentionally by Tebelek to
characterize a work that he hoped
would “weave God's spell over the
audience.”

Bill ‘Castellino starring as Jesus
in Camelot Production’s Godspell,
playing in Bloomfield.

New LP

thoughts along a-riverbank sung in
near monotone; the latter, written
by Hal David and Albert Ham-
mond, sounds good when alone on
a rainy night—Garfunkel runs over

' like warm syrup.

The album has its share of
schmaltz, too, in “Rag Doll” and
“Disney Girls.” Like a child’s
lullaby, they’re simple, pretty and

immediately likable, though Gar-.
funkel would never survive with an ‘

albumful of this stuff. It’s one side
of his music his fans have come to
accept; they can at least be grateful
he uses this . sort of material in
moderation. - '

The high point of the album is
definitely “My Little Town,”
written by Paul Simon, performed»
by Simon and Garfunkel (ahhh, but
it’s true). There’s a bit of the old

Simon social fervor that comes

through in this comment on
America’s small towns; not biting,
not ﬂag-waving, just a 1970’s
version of Paul Simon that’s
nonetheless effective: “Nothing
but the dead are dyingback in my
home town...” -

Garfunkel shines on “Lookin”
for the Right One,” a warm and
easy piece that’s typical of his best
stuff. No one else could’ve done
this better.

(But the real soaker, as far as
Artie’s platinum voice goes, is “I
Only Have Eyes for You,” one of
those moon-June-spoon tunes of
yesteryear. Released as a single,

Tebelek’s motivation in produc-
ing Godspell is worth noting.

had been working on my master’: ‘ “g

thesis at Carnegie Tech’s School of
Drama,” he recalled. “I put it
aside to go to the Easter vigil
service at the Anglican Cathedral
in Pittsburgh. It was snowing, and I
was aware of the proper setting for
a tremendous religious experience.
But the people in_ the Church
seemed bored, and the clergymen
seemed to be hurrying to get it over
with. I left with the feeling that,
rather than rolling the rock away
from the Tomb, they were piling
more on. Iwent home, took out my
manuscript and worked it to
completion in a nonstop frenzy.”

, The end result of this burst of

creative energy was a rock musicgaklwi‘

that utilizes as expressive mediaL_,"

dance, pantomime, music-hall rou-
tines, sight-gags, magical tricks
and soft-shoe shufﬂes to get across
what Tebelek considers the central
message of Christianity—love for
one’s fellow man and joy at being
part of God's creation. This view of
Christianity is currently fashion-

able and this partially accounts for

the enthusiastic reception Godspell

received at the performance I

attended. .

In many ways it was a strange
experience to observe staid middle-
aged clergymen eagerly receiving a
savior that not only wears sneakers ,,
and is made up as a clown, bur
excels in party tricks and keeps
order with. a whistle. Yet the
Christ-ﬁgure portrayed in Godspell
is capable of showing’ real emotion,
inducing deep sorrow and exhibit-
ing genuine grief.

The production at the Plaza,
produced and directed by Jerry
Communale and Nancy E. Sumner,
is ﬁrst rate. Imaginatively directed
and almost ﬂawlessly executed,
from the moment the cast of eight
spill onto the stage dressed as so
many Raggedy Anns, one is carried
along by their spirit and energy.

Bill Castellino is a marvelously
expressive Jesus who can show ir.»

his face what many actors fail to. ,

communicate in their lines. Lee
Gantt, in the dual role of John the
Baptist and Judas Iscariot has a
strong, compelling voice and gives
a thoroughly convincing perfor-
mance that comes across with style
and grace. There is no doubt that
the very talented cast is genuinely
enthusiastic about what they are
doing, and to become part of this
enthusiasm is almost unavoidable.

The set is very simple, consisting
of just two trestles and a plank, but
the action and visual impact the
cast generates is so complete in
itself that these props could in no
way be considered inadequate or
even inappropriate.

The instrumental backing pro-

vided by a four-piece band dimly~;”-g

visible behind a screen backstage S
does full justice to a score that
includes many ﬁne numbers like
“Day by Day,” and.“By My Side.”
The music is wide--ranging in
emotional impact and intelligently
complements the script, which

consists of the dramatic rendition '

of familiar New Testament para-
bles ‘and lessons presented in
burlesque form.

The ﬁrst act opens "with a
“Tower of Babble” as each player
representing various philosophers
from Plato to Sartre recites extracts
from their respective works. The
result, of course, is pure confusion,

».

which is quickly replaced by the

simplicity of the Gospel passages.

The first act culminates with an

val” to share conversation and
wine with them and help‘ break
down the barriers that serve to shut
Off the performers from the

Judas is permitted to take part in.
Godspell is not an intellectual

' "Unlike, for example, Jesus Christ

Superstar, it does not attempt to
question or analyze the role,

the literal meaning of the Nazar-
ene’s teachings.

Its style is unorthodox, some
might say meretricious, but its
peculiar strengh lies in its ability to
simply allow Christ’s philosophy

with its central theme of love and,

redemption to shine through. It is
a joyful message done joyfully.
It is also a child’s view of heaven

‘anda child’s view of God’s love for

sincerely, it works, creating perfect
harmony between style and sub-

heaven is probably the clearest,
and the dramatic attempt ‘to
re-enter childhood through simpli-
fication, play and a happy
spontaneity makes perfect logical
sense.

The repitition of the chorus line,

what we came to expect from John

almost T.V jingle-type melody that
was driven into our brains. Those
songs popped up on the street, in

Other than “Bullet,” which

courses as melodramatically as

consists largely of chintzy rockers.
John buries his flashy piano, his
key to early success, beneath a
layer of twangy guitars, and all that
comes out on top is his voice, which
was never much to write about
anyway.

How long he thinks he can put
this kind _of material out is up to
him and his teenies. There comes a

   

time, though, when serious critics
wonder if they’re reviewing a

just because his albums make it to

BY JIM LEWIS

In every life, a little rain must
fall.

But for Pitt Soccer Coach Leo
Bemis, it’s a downpour.

It’s bad enough the Pitt soccer
team has to play today’s foe-tough
Lock 'Haven—on the opponent's
home ﬁeld; but what’s worse,
Panther high scorer Al Jutca
probably will miss the game
because of torn knee ligaments
acquired in Pitt’s 2-0 victory over
Grove City.

“The game against Lock Haven
should have been a toss-up game,”
Bemis said as he looked over the
statistics, “but” right now it’s a
question mark.”

Indeed, the statistics demand a
toss-up; both teams shut out
Edinboro, both teams beat Indiana
2-0, and both teams lost to Slippery
Rock, 1-0.

Defensively, Pitt and Lock Haven
are the same—strong and stingy.
While the Lock Haven defense has
helped its team to a 9-1-1 record,
the Panther defense has given up
only 11 goals in 11 games.

Pours on Booters   I

As a matter of fact, both teams
are so close in ability that the
winner of Wednesday’s game will
be determined by the potency of
each team's offense.

Which is where the loss of Jutca
comes in.

‘‘I had a feeling that, with Jutca
in the lineup, we had reached the
point where we had the conﬁdence
to win our last three games,”
Bemis said dejectedly. “But now.
it’s questionable what we can do.”

Bemis now has to ﬁnd someone
who can take Jutca’s place at
center and score some goals for the
Panthers. That will be rough—it’s
not every day you can replace an
eight-goal scorer.

Things deﬁnitely look glum for
the 5-4-2 Panthers offensively.
Noah had a better chance against
the ﬂood, perhaps.

Perhaps not.

Bemis points his umbrella to a
few good alternatives to solve his
problem.

(1) Put right wing John Curley,
who certainly is quick and skilled
enough, at center and replace him
with another winger, probably
sophomore Bob Graham. This
could work, especially since Gra-
ham is not foreign to goal-scoring.
He has one goal in the limited time
he has played.

(2) Use freshman Mark Nigh as

a replacement for Jutca. This also.

would work, considering that Nigh
is a good ball-control player (maybe
the best on the team) and has
scored a goal in his injury-riddled
season. .

(3) Use backup center Ted
Miller, a junior who has scored a
goal in his ﬁrst action of this season
in the win over Indiana.

Either‘ way, Bemis will have an
offensive line that knows how to

well at the moment, the sun is
showing promise of peeping
through the clouds at Lock Haven.
At least, Bemis hopes that's so.
It's questionable what we can do
against Lock Haven now,” Bemis
repeated, “but no matter what,
we'll show up.” .
They sure will; the Panthers will
come double barrel at Lock Haven.
First the Pitt .lVs, the same JVs
who got 49 shots on goal to Grove
City's ﬁve in a 2-1 obliteration of
the Wolverine .IVs, will play Lock
Haven’s future heroes. Second,
the Pitt varsity team, a team much

better than its 5-4-2 recor-.z<‘“'=':_

indicates, needs two wins out of its
last three games (all on the road) to
be assured of a winning season,

Of course, that feat will be
difﬁcult; the Panthers hope to
ﬁnish out the season a winner by
taking two, possibly three, victor-
ies. But three games against tough
competition (Lock Haven, West

PITTSBURGH AP-—Quarterback
Terry Bradshaw jogged on his
injured left knee and did some

passing Tuesday as the Pittsburg'l?7f:‘-._

Steelers prepared for Sunday’s
showdown with the Cincinnati
Bengals.

“It felt pretty good. I think it will
be okay,” said Bradshaw, who
strained tendons in the knee during

n-...\JC, causing players to go
“referee-shopping.”
Penalties are counted as plays, at
least in the beginning of the game.
‘The referee, recognizing the
unfairness of some of the rules,
decides to change them in the
middle of the game, decreeing that
15-yard penalties will count as
plays, but ﬁve-yarders will not.
No line of scrimmage markers

are used, though a rag would work‘

fine. When the line referee
wanders downﬁeld to watch an
incomplete pass, it’s anybody’s
guess as to where the line of
scrimmage was.
2?» On a 60-yard ﬁeld, 15-yard
penalties are awarded for major
infractions, the equivalent of over
25 yards on a regulation ﬁeld. r

If a kickoff goes out of bounds,
the receiving team has the
incredible option of taking the ball
at midﬁeld.

Extra points count as plays, even
though in regulation football the

clock never runs.

Kickoffs count as plays, even
when kicked over the endline.

The referees get so confused
deciding whether a play counts as
one of the 20 in a half (26 in the
second) that he can’t distinguish
between play-counting and down-
counting, with some pretty ridicu-
lous results (see second para-
graph).

The above occurrences all took
place in a game in which the
officials received an “average”
rating from the referee supervisor.

ANSWER: As if you ,hadn’t
already guessed, it’s_ Pitt’s Intra-
mural Football program.

The IM ofﬁce has made a radical
change in the football program this
year, switching from a timed game
to play-counting. '

“We evaluated this method, and
discussed it with the captains,”
said IM director Leo Bemis. “It’s
an easier way to deal with the
problems we have.” ‘

Bemis cited excessive costs as a
principal reason for dumping the

clock method. “Stopwatches cost
$30 to $35 apiece, and they break if
you drop them once,” he ex-
plained.

Bemis emphasized that adjust-

.ments will be made to ease the

inequities created by the system.
The number of plays will be
increased, he said, because more
plays than originally decided upon
can be run in each time period
allotted to a game.

IM ofﬁcials receive a rule book
and a lecture. No exam is given at
Pitt, contrary to what is done at
other schools. Bemis said there
wasn’t enough time to give such an
exam, and there would be no
replacements available for those‘
who flunked.

He did add that those ofﬁcials
who are “out of it” will be weeded
out. Bear in mind that the officials
who worked the game in question‘
received an “average” rating from
the supervisor. '

I left the Arena with a funny

I thought to myself.,Did I actually .

enjoy the brutality, the ruthless-

ness and the blood of the exhibition ‘ I

I had just seen? You bet I did. _

It doesn't matter to me how _

believeable pro wrestling is. What"
does matter is that I was
entertained, I laughed and I had
fun. So the next time someone asks
me if I think pro wrestling is real or
fake, I'm just going to say, “What

difference does it make?”
