Pitt researchers to test new AIDS drug

By Pete Kapustynski
For The Pitt News

A new drug, Stavudine, is currently
being evaluated by Pitt researchers for its
treatment of HIV infection and the AIDS
virus. I

The Pitt Treatment Evaluation Unit at
Pitt’s Medical Center is participating in a
multicenter clinical evaluation of
Stavudine, or D4T.

Preliminary clinical testing seems to

show that Stavudine may increase the -

number of immune cells in the blood for
a longer period of time than Zidovudine

(AZT) or dideoxyinosine (DDI), according
to the producer of the drug, Bristol-Meyrs
Squibb.

Phase one testing of Stavudine has
already been completed. Phase one testing
involves clinical trials of dose ranging and
toxicity, Assistant Professor of Medicine
Division of Infectious Diseases Deborah
McMahon said.

Dose ranging determines what dosage
of the drug produces an effective level of
the drug in the bloodstream and is tolerated
by the patient, she said.

McMahon said phase one testing also
involves the study of any resulting toxic

side effects that may occur with use of the
drug.

Dr. John Mellors, Assistant Professor of
Medicine Division of Infectious Diseases
said that PTEU will compare other
treatments with Stavudine to measure its
relative effectiveness.

“In this phase of testing, D4T will be
compared to the current standard of
treatment, which is AZT,” Mellors said.

Researchers will be testing on individuals
who are infected with the HIV virus and
who have been undergoing treatment with
AZT for the past six months, according to
McMahon.

City cites university fraternity

“It will be a randomized clinical trial of
700 patients at various sites around the
country, of which Pitt is one,” Mellors
said. “The testing started in May and will
continue for 14 months.”

Mellors said volunteers are needed for
this study and though currently only 10
individuals are enrolled, they are hoping
for 20 to 30 more.

Anyone who is interested in participating
in this study or any other HIV§related
study is asked to call for more information.

houses for building violation

By Pete Kapustynski
Staff Writer

Pitt fraternities and sororities were hit
with massive building code violations
after an inspection initiated by the
Pittsburgh‘ City Council.

Calling Oakland houses tinderboxes,
Pittsburgh City Council member Michelle

Madoff initiated a task force to investigate _
_ substandard housing.

“Oakland is an accident waiting to
happen,” Pittsburgh City Council President
Jack Wagner said. He cited the serious
problems with large numbers of
substandard housing units, the proximity
of numerous hospitals and the removal of
the fire truck from the Oakland ﬁre house.

Madoff said she proposed the
investigation after requesting a report on
building code violations of fraternity and
sorority houses in Oakland.

According to the report given to the city
council on June 10, all 31 fraternity and
sorority houses in Oakland had at least
one building code violation.

Violations ranged from exit signs having
burned-out bulbs to no smoke detectors
in bedrooms or basements, ﬂammable
and explosive materials in houses, illegal
electrical splices and taps in basements.

In response to the report, Madoff said
she would rather see students “moved to
alternate housing than being carried out
[on stretchers after a firel.”

But some fraternity members are
skeptical of the investigation.

Michael Mangin, who is in charge of
the Delta Sigma Phi house which received
20 violations, said the house was inspected
by the health department and the fire

department in January and February.

“We are inspected twice a year for
health and fire violations. They found
nothing wrong in the last inspection.”

Mangin said fraternity members living
in the house were surprised by the sudden
inspection and have not yet been notified
of any violations. “When we are notified,
we will fix everything on the report,”
Mangin said.

Jeremy Weiss, president of Pi Lambda
Phi, whichalso received 20 violations,
said, “We weren’t worried about [the
inspection] at all. [The violations] Came as
a big surprise to us. We were just inspected
four months ago for fire insurance, and
we passed with a clean bil1.’f

Weiss said the residents were unaware
that some of the things cited were actually
violations. “We had no idea you couldn’t
keep cans of paint in the basement. I don’t
know of any house that doesn’t have cans
of paint in their basement.”

Weiss said his fraternity has taken steps
to correct the problems. “Everything on
my list, with the exception of the fire-
escape window, has been corrected so
far. The window has been ordered and
paid for. Once it’s installed, we’re going to
request a new inspection.

“Believe me, there is no one in this city

that wants this house to burn down less -

than we do,” Weiss said. “As soon as we’re

informed of these violations, we’ll be

more than willing to make the repairs.”
Violations were also listed for Amos

Hall, which houses 10 sororities at Pitt.
Violations included light fixtures not

working, cover plates missing or broken

and tub or shower stalls that have peeling

Business School

 

By Jason Hillman
Managing Editor A _

Paul J. Prokop Jr. was named
the new director of development
for the Joseph M. Katz Graduate

School of Business on Mon-

day.

Prokop, a Pittsburgh native,
has worked for Pitt since 1988 as
director of the Katz school’s
Associates Program, director of
development for international
programs and director of
continuing education at Pitt’s
Johnstown campus.

“Well, I’m very pleased to have
this appointment,” Prokop said.
“It’s a real milestone in my career,
and I’m honored to‘ have this
position at this institution. It is a
remarkable opportunity for me
to try to facilitate the further
growth and development of the
Katz school.”

"Prokop is responsible for the
Katz school’s capital—giving
efforts, the annual giving fund
and the corporate gift-matching
program. Right now Prokop is
awaiting the decision concerning
the proposed development of an

undergraduate business school,
which would have a major impact
because of possible plans to raise
resources to support that

J program.

The Katz school’s 18-year-old
Associates Program, a corporate

- relations program with 200 firms

and organizations participating,
will continue to be overseen by
Prokop.

He said he is also working on
a large number of funding
initiatives, including seeking
funds to endow professorships

. and to fund the various institutes

and centers. _

After working for several years
at Pitt-Johnstown, Prokop said
he is glad to be back in Pittsburgh.
“Being a Pittsburgh native, it’s
very appealing to me to come
back here so that my family and
I could take advantage of all the
benefits that the Pittsburgh region
offers.”

Prokop graduated from St.
Vincent ‘College in Latrobe, Pa.,
with a degree in psychology and
received an M.A. in industrial/

organizational psychology from

George Mason University.

“[The degree] has actually been
very useful. Industrial psychology
teaches you about organizational
development. As a development
professional, that’s really what
I’m all about, providing the Katz
school with critical resources that
it needs to achieve its goals,”
Prokop said.

“As a behavioral scientist, you
acquire an understanding of
human motivation and of
organizational structure and
process and that’s all directly
relevant to the work that I
do.”

 

 

THE PI'IT NEWS, Wednesday, June 24, 1992

 

Pitt 's first woman vice-chancellor dies at 94

Helen Pool,R»ushv .

A legendary figure at the
University of Pittsburgh, Helen
Pool Rush, the first woman vice
chancellor of the university, who
served the institution through
eight chancellors and over 50
years, died yesterday at
Presbyterian University Hospital.
She was 94.

“In her magniﬁcent career at
the university, Helen Pool Rush
served women students, served
all students —— with her warmth,
her wisdom and her great capacity
of caring for others. This university
was a community, a home for her
for more than 70 years. And she
made this place, for many
thousands of others_, a more
enlightened community of
learning and a better home. By
the merit of her work, by the.
quality of her life, she was a true
and loving educator,” Pitt
Chancellor J. Dennis O’Connor
said.

From her graduation in 1919
until her retirement in 1970, Miss
Rush served Pitt students in
various capacities. She was named

Dean of Women in 1942 and
became Dean of Students in 1961.
In 1965 she was appointed Vice
Chancellor of Student‘ Affairs.

She originated Pitt traditions,
including Lantern Night, the
ceremony for first—year women
students and Mortar Board, a
senior women’s honorary
organization. Rush is also
responsible for forming Quo
Vadis, the voluntary guide group
for the Nationality Rooms at the
Cathedral of Learning. She was
the ﬁrst Director of Heinz Chapel,
and in that capacity helped many
hundreds of Pitt alumni plan their
chapel weddings.

In 1976 the Nationality Rooms
Program established the Helen
Pool Rush Travel ‘and Study
Abroad Scholarship Endowment.
Over the years it has sent 16
undergraduate men and women
to such diverse countries as
Norway, Russia, Tunisia and
China. _

In 1964 she was named

Family House provides home environment for long term illness patients

Edward Goldhahn
For T be Pitt News

“Home away from home” is

the motto which life-threateningly '

ill patients, their families and a
volunteer staff live by each day at
Family House. I

First opened in 1983, Family
House provides all the comforts
of home for patients awaiting
transplants and medical treatment
for other life-threatening illnesses,
according to Family House
Executive Director Mary Lou
McLaughlin. “Everyone here helps
each other out. You just can’t go
through this on your own. It
helps to have someone to eat
with, laugh with, cry with,”
McLaughlin said.

According to McLaughlin,
Family House offers a
comfortable, affordable and
accessible place to live for patients
and their families. “Patients can
stay here for $20 a day rather
than $2,500 a day in intensive
care, having a better quality of
life with their families, sitting on

the porch or in the backyard,”
she said. P

Family House resident Ken
Varner said it is the only place in
the world where he can live
comfortably outside of intensive
care. Varner’s heart is being
pumped by the most
technologically advanced heart-
assistance device in the world
while he awaits a transplant. The
device is called Novacor. It is
implanted into the pelvic area
and assists the heart’s main
pumping chamber. It hooks up
to a computerized piece of
equipment which weighs over
400 pounds and is wheeled
around with Varner wherever he
goes. ’ r

Although it sounds restricting,
the_ Novacor allows Varner
freedom that other patients
awaiting heart transplants" will
never have, he said.

“I feel very fortunate to have
the Novacor, and being able to
stay here [at Family House] is like
icing on the cake,” Varner said.

Family House’s convenient

McLaughlin said.

Varner said he and his family,
which includes his wife and 9-

in West Virginia to live at Family

Family House operates with
the help of private donations.

in 1984, the tournament raises

I don’t think any other city besides

there such a caring community
of people who sincerely care
about the quality of other people's

Staff Writer

Designed to help students, staff
and faculty meet the challenges
and responsibilities of college
learning, the Learning Skills

Students can improve the
quality of their academic
performance, as well as utilize
their time more wisely and

independent learner, according

, to coordinator of the Learning

Skills Center Georgine Materniak.
The Reading Component of
the LSC is designed to increase
one’s vocabulary, one’s ability to
comprehend and retain non-

efficiency ‘rate and one’s
confidence in mastering college
reading assignments, she said.
One course offered through
the Reading Component is the
Effective Reading Program. The
Effective Reading Program is a
small group workshop that meets

for two hours, once a week for
six weeks. According to
Materniak, this is beneficial to
the student who prefers a

In addition to the small group
workshops, the Reading
Component also offers

_individualized programs.

For the individual who already
has effective reading skills but
would like to increase his or her
reading rate, the Reading
Component offers a program in
speed reading.

The LSC Speed Reading
program has been specifically
designed for an academic
environment.

“That program was designed
and put together by our reading
specialist so that we would know
that it was specifically geared for
academic type reading,”
Materniak said.

The course includes methods
of adjusting one’s reading rate
when encountering difficult
material, improving eye

The Pittsburgh Lesbian, Gay,
Bisexual Pride Committee
announced its plans to form a
local committee to go to the 1993
March on Washington for
Lesbian, Gay and Bi Equal Rights
and Liberation at a town meeting
Monday night in the William Pitt
Union.

The national march on
Washington is scheduled for April
26, 1995.

Pride celebrations are held in
the month of June in recognition
of the June 1969 New York
Stonewall Riots in which the
police raided the Greenwich
Village Stonewall Inn, a gay bar,
according to the Pittsburgh Pride

. Guide.

According to the Pride Guide,
“homosexuals with flamboyant,
unconventional lifestyles,
including transvestites, known
as street queens,” frequented the
Stonewall Inn. The Pride Guide

History of physical therapy exploredin

By Heather Gahres

Asst. News Editor

Films, interviews and photos
from the past 60 years combined
together to present the history of
physical therapy at the video

premiere of “Teaching the Hands,

that Heal: The History of Physical
Therapy in Western
Pennsylvania” this past weekend.

“[The program] has allowed us '

each to step back a little bit and
reﬂect on our own lives and
school. We are part of a very rich
history and proud tradition,”
director of Pitt’s physical therapy
department Rosemary Scully said.
-The video shows the history of
teaching physical therapy in
Western Pennsylvania, beginning
with the D.T. Watson Hospital
and continuing to the transition
to the University of Pittsburgh.
“David Thompson Watson, an
attorney for the United States
who negotiated the Alaskan
boundary dispute, donated his

calls the raid the birth of the
modern gay movement.

The town meeting for the march
on Washington was held as part
of a series of events for Pride
Week, June 18 to 27. All of the
Pittsburgh Pride Committee-
sponsored events are signed for
the hearing impaired and
accessible to the physically
challenged.

The Pittsburgh City Council
recognized Pride Week in its
Tuesday meeting. The city council
proclaimed Saturday June 27
“Lesbian/Gay/Bisexual Pride
Day” in the city of Pittsburgh. It
also recognized and saluted pride
in the Lesbian/Gay/Bisexual
community in Pittsburgh.

“Over the past two decades,
the rich ethnic, social and cultural
heritage of our city has been
further enriched by the
emergence of the gay/1esbian/
bisexual community which has
become more visible and active
in creating and promoting rights
and opportunities for sexual

home outside of Sewickley to be
used as a home for children 3-16,
especially those who are crippled
or deformed, “ master of
ceremonies for the event Robert
Osborne said. ’

Interviews of past alumni and
physical therapy directors of D.T.
Watson and Pitt were combined
with photos from the 19303 to
the present to make the video,
Regina Vitti, physical therapy
administrative affairs coordinator,
said.

Former director of physical
therapy at D.T. Watson Mary
Elizabeth Kolb described what
the treatment center was like.

“It was a beautiful 150—acre ,
estate for the school and home of 1

crippled children. We had a
greenhouse and 75 acres in farm
land. The classroom was the_old
billiards room in the mansion,”
Kolb said.

Supreme error

Cross burnings, racial epithets, gay bashings, rape and
organized hate—group violence are epidemic for
disenfranchised people in the United States. Fighting hate
crimes has been a priority for civil rights proponents, but
action may be stymied.

On Monday in R.A.V. v. St. Paul, the Supreme Court

Hate-crime legislation is not a new invention. As part of a
19503 civil rights movement, hate crimes were addressed, as
was school desegregation. In the late 1950s, Pennsylvania
passed the Ethnic Intimidation Act, adding penalties for
criminal activity for which the motivation is the victim's-race,
religion or ethnic background.

At issue in the court’s decision was St. Paul’s adoption of
an ordinance barring cross burning and swastika displays
that arouse “anger, fear or resentment” for reasons of race,

Shakespeare Summer

Steel/City traces history of Pittsburgh laborers

- By Michelle Kleinsak

Staff Writer

Sitting in Mellon Square ﬁlling
my stomach with lunch, I watched
the light rays refract off the Alcoa
Building, showering the man-

 made environment with sunlight.
Taking in this visual plethora of

steel and concrete, I found it
hard to imagine the time when
the sky hung so heavy and black
that day easily passed into night
and nobody knew the difference.

By now we have all heard how
gas lamps once lit Pittsburgh
streets at 3:00 in the afternoon so

' that men could find their way

home through the smog and soot.
For most of my generation this is
legend, yet we know it to be fact
— through documents, history
classes, paintings and vocal
testament. Pitt theater professors
Gillette Elvgren and Attilio
Favorini explore all of these
sources to bring Steel/City to the

, stage as part of the Three Rivers A

Shakespeare Festival.

Steel/City relishes Pittsburgh’s
industrial history and diverse
ethnic culture. The play, a
docudrama with musical bits
thrown in here and there, probes
the relationship between the
development of industry and the
development of the city. ,

The scope is divided into three
acts with each act showing the
various catalysts that alter this
relationship. The first act
establishes the discovery and
growth of Pittsburgh from frontier
town to Iron City. Its socialist

tendencies ask us to ponder
whether a city is conceptually
created from a commitment to
the common good.

The act provides a history lesson
spanning the time from the
Whiskey Rebellion of 1794 to the
infamous trial of MayorJoe Barker.
(For those of you who aren’t up
on your local history, Barker was
a racist mayor who actually

managed to get elected while in
jail.)

It was around this time that
Andrew Carnegie moved to
Pittsburgh from his native
Scotland and began to emerge as
a major financial force in the city.
Carnegie is portrayed with dollar

East meets West in TRSF's adaptation of Hamlet's Ophelia

By Robert Penman
Staff‘ Writer

Shakespeare’s Hamlet meets 13th-
century Japanese theater in the Three
Rivers Shakespeare Festival’s bold
reworking of this literary pillar of Western
culture, Ophelia.

The script itselfis an original adaptation

.of Hamlet which focuses on.Ophelia and '

the events that surrounded her up to the
time of her death.

According to director Jonah Salz, he
used the traditional noh style, derived
from Zen Buddhist theater, of focusing on
a single character from a well—known
story to create Ophelia’s battle with her
subconscious and her coming to terms
with her untimely death.

The drama is a memory play that takes
place 23 years after Ophelia’s death. The
cast is narrowed to Ophelia, Hamlet,
Polonius, Laertes, a gravedigger and a
priest. The noh players include Ophelia’s
ghost, a drummer, a cellist and a
personified representation of Doubt.

Despite the years that have passed
since Ophelia’s death, the play aptly
recreates the tension .and energy of the
events in Shakespeare’s Denmark. Salz
weaves American and Japanese players
together to create a mood that is bizarre
and riveting.

The sparse set contains nine tombstones

on which the characters rest when they are
not part of the scene. The back of the stage
is raised where Ophelia’s ghost spends
most of the drama looking into a full-
length mirror.A second mirror is hung
across the set into which characters peer to
see accurate representations of themselves.
The mirror images also give the graveyard
spirits an extra dimension, making them
less transient and more tangible.

The costumes linger ‘between noh and
Elizabethan styles, with Ophelia’s ghost in
traditional noh dress and Ophelia in
traditional Shakespearean dress.

Ophelia’s ghost‘ undergoes subtle
costume changes in the second act that
indicate she has indeed come to an
understanding within herself.

The role of the ghost is unusual in that
it moves mysteriously around the set and
occasionally makes calls in Japanese. The
metamorphosis that runs through Ophelia’s
soul portrays a bold mixture between the
greatest piece of fiction in the English
language and a culture, language and
religion that have been —— with the
exception of lingual similarities to Korea’s
and T ojo’s bold Pacific military campaigns
— parts of a society so small that it could
be housed along the New Jersey Turnpike
and a people isolated from any ripples of
European civilization.

The role of the drummer adds another
element of Japanese ascetic but is also

challenging. Mitsuharu Agemizu sits on
the raised portion of the stage and follows
the drama with heartbeating thumps and
chilling Japanese calls. The characters
appear not to acknowledge the percussion

.but follow its rhythms and cues. His role

is obscure; however it is a strong catalyst
in the building of the crescendotoward
the play’s denouement.

The most engaging character in the
show is Doubt. Played by Kinneret Noy,
she serves as a liaison between Ophelia
and her ghost, helping Ophelia explore
her lack of inner conviction and ego
deficit. Doubt slinks around the stage

unnoticed by the characters. Noy’si

character plays fabulously against Candice
Brown—McDonald’s confused and passive
Ophelia. They recite lines together and

play off one another with perfect timing.

Doubt, unlike our lady Ophelia, is not a
passive character. She is a strong creature
who actively seeks answers, aiding
Ophelia’s haunted soul in her quest for
eternal slumber. —

Another striking performance is given
by Dawn Alden, who plays Queen
Gertrude. Given many of Claudius’s lines,
she becomes the queen whom Ophelia

‘ recognizes through her abstnise ﬁlter rather

than the character created by Shakespeare.

Alden’s interpretation is brilliant; her
stage presence undeniable. She
convincingly plays the Queen of Denmark

with self-assurance and conducts her
magistrate with meet sensibilities.

Kevin McDonald’s role as Hamlet
sometimes pales against Alden’s strong
performance, and this is unforgivable.
However one exception is the scene when
he and Ophelia aurally duke it out over
her alleged fealty toward him and their
intimate disposition. McDonald barks out
a hardcore “Getthee to a nunnery, woman!”
with a facial visage and ocular stare that
could dispatch any formidable villain
straight into a concentric circle in the far
reaches of Dante’s Inferno. Perhaps
Director Salz ought to play up McDonald’s
intensity and portray Hamlet as more of a
hothead.

Along that line, McDonald and David
Fielding perform an; unforgettable
graveyard scene in opening the second
act. Fielding, who plays the gravedigger
and, ironically, the only living character,
gives the viewer a hilarious reconstruction
of Ophelia’s demise and revels in his dirt-
nap detail of literally burying the cast.
Rarely does one see such grim and
terrestrial humor on stage.

In closure, this is a performance not to
be missed despite its minor shortcomings,
some of which will most likely be shaken
off after one or two performances. Last
year’s dry interpretation of Othello pales
when compared with this bold attempt to
bridge such different cultures.

Casondra Sobieralski
For The Pitt News

It’s summertime and you're only
taking a class or two. With minimal
academic structure in your life,
your imagination is free to flow
with the balmy breezes.

How can you channel all the
creative energy you are feeling?
You could lie on Flagstaff Hill
and seek shapes in the cottony
clouds  or you could spend
your spare time learning new
means of expression at The
Pittsburgh Center for the
Arts. -

This summer The Center is
offering 73 adult classes and
workshops. Most instruction is in
the two- and three—dimensional

visual arts, but there will also be‘

classes in the areasvof dance,
acting and ﬁtness. ,

Two—dimensional art classe_s
include calligraphy, drawing,
painting, photography and
printmaking.

Painting students can choose
from oil, acrylic or watercolor
classes. Photography enthusiasts

. can enjoy the benefits of

exceptional technical facilities.
Both intaglio (etching, engraving,
drypoint) and seriography
(silkscreen) techniques are on
the list of printmaking
classes. I

The Center is offering a
multitude of three-dimensional
classes, many of which are not

available at Pitt. Eco—enthusiasts
can learn to craft handmade paper
from accumulated stacks of mail.

You can also “reconnect with
the earth” by shaping cool, muddy
clay in a sculpture or ceramics
class. Ceramicists can take
advantage of summer weather
and do raku firing outside.

If you are interested in jewelry,
you can learn lost wax and metal
fabrication processes.

in a woodworking class you
can make furniture for your
apartment or dorm.

Through creative skills you,

learn in a fibers or surface-
finishing course, you can turn
that hideous couch from Great-
Aunt Edna into a personalized
work of art. '
Outside the realm of visual
arts, The Center offers classes

such as Latin-style and ballroom

dancing.

With the current wave of
filmmaking in Pittsburgh, why
not take Acting for the Camera? If
your interests -lean toward
alternative health and fitness,
there are classes in T’ai Chi and
Yoga for you.

Instructors at The Center are
professional artists from the area
who actively exhibit their own
work. Many are members of The
Associated Artists of Pittsburgh
and other guilds.

Some, such as Carnegie—Mellon

professor Herb Olds, teach at

universities.

make his $400 million deal
withJ.P. Morgan, who, by the
way, is portrayed in a rather
tongue-in—cheek manner as
an octopus snatching up as
many companies as he can
with his appendages. This
scene closes out the 19th
century and thrusts us forward
into a steel pensioner’s picnic
in 1975. .

The third and final act is
probably the most dramatic
and the least documentary in
style. A slew of immigrants
talk about the good old days
and the bad old days, and
very often they disagree about
which days fall into which
category. Here we see the
“grass is always greener”
theory in practice. Characters
speak of how they dreamed
of coming to America to
escape the conditions in their
homeland, yet after enduring
the conditions in this country
some of them wish they had
never left home in the first
place. Listening to each
person’s story, no matter how
ethnically» or racially
individualized, you get a sense
that they are all part of the
same common denominator.

Elvgren’s direction shows
this familial bond, especially
in the picnic scenes, and the
use of stylized violence in the
Homestead strike scene is
particularly effective. _

Seana Kate Livingston lights
the stage as Veronica with her
powerful rendition of “Soho
on Saturday Night.” One of
the most memorable moments
of the show occurs in the
third act when Thelma Henry,
played by Rerna Webb, belts
in a soulful, sultry voice
“Things Ain’t What They Used
To Be.” If historical drama
isn't your bag, the whole show
is worth it just to hear her sing
this song.

Overall, .S‘teeVCz'ty provides
some interesting glimpses into
the. lives of the people who
built this town. If you are not
from the area, it might do you
well to check it out and find
out more about the city you
live in. If you are from here,
you might‘ learn something
new anyway.

Pitt spending records show lack of gender equity

By Ryan Buncher
Asst. Sports Editor

Despite being much less than the amount
originally reported, the $5,412,400 spent
by Pitt on operating -expenditures for

men’s athletics in the 1990-91 school year

is the largest amount of funds spent of all
schools listed in a recent article in The New
Yorle Times.

Pitt spent $250,006 on women’s athletics,

‘ only 6.8 percent of the total amount spent

on operating expenditures. That is the
largest discrepancy on the list, which does
not include every school in Division I
since some refused to respond.

Among the programs included, Louisiana
State University was second in men’s
[expenditures with $2,848,651, but they
spent $663,399 on women’s sports, 18.9
percent of the total. No other program

spent under 10 percent of its total on
women’s sports, Georgia Tech being the
closest with 13 percent. /

The figure listed in Sunday’s Times was
$6,170,295. Assistant Athletic Director/
Public Relations Larry Eldridge said that
the total was a mistake and that the
information submitted by the university
was incorrect and provided the corrected
figures.

These included $1,659,195 that was
used for upkeep of Pitt Stadium and
$1,098,700 .in coaching salaries. .

The chart was originally run in The
Chronicle of Higher Education. Doug
Letterman, senior editor for athletics of
the Chronicle, said that he compiled the
information from a survey which the
NCAA asked schools to fill out last summer.

The operating expenditure category
included money spent on travel, meals,

uniforms, equipment, officials and lodging,
all things related "to the playing of the
games." Stadium maintenance was not to
be included, and coaches’ salaries were a
separate category.

Eldridge also said that the amounts
listed for scholarships were wrong. He
said $1,936,275 was spent for men and
$547,747 for women, as opposed to
$1,668,308 and $59,281 respectively listed
in the Chronicle. Based on the revised
numbers, 77.9 percent of the total
expenditures was spent on men’s
recruiting. '

According to the figures supplied by
Eldridge, 93.5 percent of the money spent
on recruiting went toward men’s sports.

Vanderbilt had the lowest percentage of
funds for women’s sports with 6.2, and
Oklahoma State, Wake Forest, Georgia
Tech and Oregon also spent less than 10

percent on their men’s teams.

4 The overall money spent on athletics at
Pitt totaled $7,494,858, with $6,450,375
going to men’s teams. The program has 11
men’s teams and eight women’s
teams. -

At a university which has 51.8 percent.

men in its overall population, 78.1 percent
of the athletes at Pitt are men.

This brings up the question of ‘gender.
equity at Pitt. Under NCAA rules, each,

athletic program must provide the same
opportunities for female athletes that it
does for males. - ‘

“Much of the history behind this is from A

budgets designed under the ‘past
administration,” Eldridge said.

Current Athletic Director Oval Jaynes is
still recovering from bypass surgery and

was not available to comment on the -

report.

Former Georgetown star Alonzo Mourning should be taking his Ewing-like skills to ‘Charlotte.

O'Neal tops talent—laden NBA draft

By Brian Berger

and Rob Pugliese
For The Pitt News

It’s plucking time again as
the National Basketball
Association holds its annual
draft, and this season’s crop is"
indeed bumper. With a bushel
of underclassmen declaring
their independence, 1992’s pool
will go down as the deepest in
at least a decade, with every
team (with a selection)

~ balancing its future in hopes of

landing a contributor. Here are
our intrepid picks:

1. Orlando Magic— Shaquille
O’Neal, 7—feet, 1-inch, L.S.U.

_ The Shaq daddy will make

Orlando, Ju mp!Ju mp! Besides,
who else are you gonna take?
2. Charlotte Hornets —
Alonzo Mourning, 6-10,
Georgetown. A better scorer
than Ewing in a similar stage in
his career, a better intimidator
than Motumbo, a better Hornet
franchise and a lot more hats
for the team to sell.

3. Minnesota Timberwolves
— Christian Laettner, 6-11,
Duke. C.L. Smooth is a winner
heading to a plagued franchise.
He truly is the great white
hope. -

4. Dallas Mavericks —Jimmy

‘ Jackson, 6-6, Ohio State. Our

feeling is that double] is a bit
overrated as the fourth
selection, but the Mavs are
already committed. His ball-
handling is suspect, as is his
jumper. Still he’s a tremendous
athlete who is extremely clutch.
5. Denver Nuggets —
Laphonso Ellis, 6-8, Notre
Dame. Word has it that the
Nuggets won’t even entertain
offers for this selection anymore
because they love the smooth
Ellis. An outstanding leaper
whose stock has risen after a
banner senior season and
impressive rookie camps, he
resembles.

6. Washington Bullets ——-
T o_m Gugliotta, 6-10, NC State.

Bullets management has»

already grouped him with Larry

Bird. He is an outstanding all-
around performer who can play
three positions and has excellent
outside range and passing ability
7. Sacramento Kings —Adam
Keefe, 6-9, Stanford.

Homegrown product who is a

monster on the boards and can
score. The "Kings were the clear
losers of the lottery, landing this
low pick. A good bet is that they
will trade this selection (and
possibly Mitch Richmond).

. 8. Milwaukee Bucks—-Harold '

Minor, 6-5, USC. Another lottery
loser, heavy speculation has the
Bucks dealing Dale Ellis for
anything, Jay Humphries for
anything and maybe even this
pick for anything.Baby Jordan
(Miner) is the logical choice
here, but the Bucks are slow
and old and it may take them
years to catch up to Miner's
talents.

,9. Philadelphia ’76ers —— Walt

Williams, 6-8, Maryland. No Moe
Charles, but things may be Moe
better in Philly as the Sixers

New soccer recruits
could turn losing 
program around

By Brian Gallagher
Senior Sports Writer 3

Any sports team that finishes last in league play looks to the future
as a time of improving. In collegiate sports, the future comes in the
form‘ of new recruits — athletes who bring a fresh combination of
enthusiasm and talent to a losing program.

The goal: to build the foundation for a winning team.

The above description applies in spades-to the Pvitt-soeeer-pregraw-———,

After finishing the 1991 season as cellar dwellers of the Big East
conference, going 0-6-2 in league play, the Pitt soccer program
needed a strong recruiting. class. It needed somebody  or rather,
some bodies. —

Well it got some bodies, some very talented soccer—playing bodies
in the form of the soccer class of 1996, according to head coach Joe
Luxbacher. ,

“-On paper, this may be overall the best recruiting class in terms of:
numbers and depth,” Luxbacher said. “Of the six recruits we really‘:
went after, five of them are coming. That’s a very high percentage.”

Leading the latest class of Pitt soccer recruits is Todd Graf from Mt.
Lebanon High School. Graf was an attacking midﬁelder for Mt. Lebo,
where he garnered all—state and all-‘WPIAL honors. . ’

‘‘He’s definitely one of the premier players in the WPIAIj',’7"‘
Luxbacher said, adding that Graf also won MVP honors at an indoor
tournament over the winter and is currently playing for the 19-and-
under Beadling club team. _

Also heading the class of recruits set to wear Panther blue and gold
are forward Dean Astorino of Upper St. Clair and goalkeeper Adam
Spitzer from Marlboro (New Jersey) High School. An all-WPIAL
striker, Astorinowas the leading scorer for his school and led them
to the state finals. Currently playing for the Beadling club team, he
is described by Luxbacher as “a good goal scorer.”

Others in the recruiting group'that the Panthers’ eighth-year coach

describes as “some of the best players in this area” are all—WPIAL

midfielder Jeff Porter from Penn—Trafford, Ringgold High School
midfielderJ.L. Gorsin and midfielder Keith Hoetzlein of Bethel Park
High School. .

While most of his recruits tallied their share of honors and statistics‘
during high school, Luxbacher said he takes such overpublicized
entities with a grain of salt, preferring rather to focus on the
intangibles.

“I’m not a big statistics person," Luxbacher said. “Statistics only tell
you so much. Personally, I think they're overrated. You look at how
a guy performs. He might not be the fastest or biggest, but if he gets
it done, he gets it done.”

Luxbacher added that all his recruits have the potential to be ' A

successful at Pitt, but it doesn’t necessarily mean they’re going to
"come in right away and start. 5 _
“It’s a big step coming to the Big East, but these are still players that
have played at a high level, so they should help.” ~
Luxbacher said he expects 10 to 12 new players — including
several walk-ons —— along with 20 returning players.
“The team is pretty much set, except for maybe two or three players
here or there that we’re not absolutely sure are coming or not.
“We don’t keep that many. Pitt dresses 24 players,” Luxbacher said,

Mo'money means mo’ violence in pro sports

' Violence and sports. The words
go hand in hand . '. . or I should
say,‘ fist in face. '

Since human beings started the
jsyogriewhat juvenile yet totally

,:"<__é_7:,‘jr‘».‘i_4}ivl'arating experience of

’there has always been an

environment of potential violence

ebbing from arenas and stadiums

everywhere.

It’s a possible hazard of
competition. But it never got out
of hand. Especially in professional
sports . . . at least_ until this
spring.

From the smashmouth tactics
in the NBA playoffs to the
mindless mound—charging antics
of major league baseball, the
sports world has hit a new low on
the sportsmanship meter. It’s
violently out of control.

Boxing and auto racing, ok.
They own the rights to violence
as we know it in athletic
competition today. With cars
blazing within inches of each

other around brickyards at 225
‘ miles per hour, the word “fender-

bender” just may pop up once in
a while.

But baseball and basketball?
Say it ain’t so.

Well, it is so. Just think back
and recall the highlights of any
ESPN Sportscenter in the past
eight weeks. The evidence is
overwhelming.

Nothing but brawls in baseball,
followed by violent action in
basketball, and a return to more

mound wrestling. Why? It all T

points to one thing, money.

NBA — No Babies Allowed!

safe to watch an NBA playoff
game — with the Detroit Pistons

it.

In the midst of a five-game
slugfest with the true bullies of
‘ball, the Pistons, Patrick Ewing
and company found that it was
possible to beat an over-the-hill,
semi—talented group of

Brian
Gallagher

Motowners by fouling more,
elbowing harder, and talking
louder. They also found it possible
to warm the cockles of both the
national media and all
bandwagon Bulls haters alike.
When the Knicks met the
defending champion Bulls for a
second round blood bath, the
attention of “caveman hoops”
totally drowned out the other
Eastern conference series
between the Cavs and Celtics,
which featured classic playoff
basketball; full of skill and fire —

minus the trash.

And while slickster Pat Riley
and crew received their long-
deserved ouster at the hands of
the two-time NBA champs,
smashball is alive and kicking in
the Big Apple and the NBA. The
Knicks showed the basketball
world that if you can’t beat a
talented, clean team, you can try
to maul ‘em. It got the Knicks to
a seventh game. It gave the NBA
a bloody lip.. _

And in this corner . . .

With the NHL side-stepping
the art of fighting for a mostly
civil (sans Adam Graves and
Shane Courson) Stanley Cup final,
some sport had to step up to fill
the void and satisfy the lust of
bloodthirsty fans. That sport is
baseball.

In an ever—increasing trend —
which by no coincidence parallels
the ridiculous rise in player
salaries — mock bench-clearing
brawls have become a veritable
tradition for our national pastime.

date with wrestling, a fine, and a

The’ latest ﬁasco involved Fred

Money. . .That’s whatl
Want '

In a high—speed activity
like hockey — which involves
passionate, muscle—bound
Northerners flying and
bodychecking around a
piece of ice enclosed by
glass and wood — physical
contact is not only expected,
it is encouraged and enjoyed
by loyal fans of the
sport.

But in a high—flying activity
like basketball — which
entertains fans with brilliant
displays of grace, agility,
and coordination via
mediums such like the Karl
Malone thunder dunk, a
Mark Price ‘three, and the

" David Robinson rejection —

hockey—like bullying antics
such as blatant fouls with
the intent to injure are not
encouraged and accepted .
. . until now.

And in a precision-perfect
sport of baseball — where
Roger Clemens strikeouts,
Mark McGuire three-run
dingers, and diving catches
by Andy Van Slyke make it
the quintessential attraction
of sports purists everywhere

 —vhot—headed debates and

scrums at the mound over a

no-no . . . until now.

Unwarranted violence has
become almost as much a
given in basketball and
baseball as free throws and
intentional walks. J

Money is the only reason.

It changes everything — it
makes the civil unrest, the
aggressive goonish, and the
goons cheap—shot artists.

When words like
contracts, renegotiation, free
agency and endorsements
ﬂowing out of locker rooms
like champagne after
winning a championship,
tension saturates every
inning and period of even
the most meaningless
game.

One stray pitch to the
head, one hard fall on the
back, and a lucrative career
can end.

So with tension over
careers and livelihoods
permanently emblazoned in
the corporate minds of
catchers and stoppers alike,
it’s not likely to end

It won't end until a semi-
rational control of the money
flow in major sports take
place. Unfortunately that is
about as likely as the Cubs
and Indians meeting in the
World Series.

With attendance and
popularity in basketball and
baseball better than ever,
and the players holding up
the owners for all they can
get, there is simply no end
in sight in the greedy sprint
to the bank. . . as well as the
short tempers between the
white lines.

Champs reshufﬂed after expansion draft

By Jim Clark
Slajf Writer

Three members of Pittsburgh’s
two Stanley Cup teams are now
going to be playing their hockey
elsewhere. Goalie Wendell Young
and defenseman Peter T aglianetti
were selected by the Tampa Bay
Lightning in last Thursday’s
expansion draft, while free agent
defenseman Gordie Roberts
signed with Boston on Friday.

Of the three, Young may be the
one missed most. In his four
seasons with the Penguins he
was a competent backup and
third goalie. His departure leaves
the Pens with only two NHL-
caliber goalies: Tom Barrasso and
Ken Wregget. If both can stay
healthy, Young will not be missed.
If either gets injured or if Barrasso
holds out, a goaltending problem
may arise. The Penguins have no
minor leaguers with any NHL
experience. Bruce Racine hasn’t
been overly impressive in his
four seasons at Muskegon
(Pittsburgh’s minor league

affiliate). Muskegon’s other two
goalies, Rob Dopson and Alain
Morrisette, only have two years
of minor league experience.
The losses of Roberts and
Taglianetti are less likely to affect
the Pens. Both (especially
Roberts) have played well in
their two seasons here, but
neither rates higher than a fifth
defenseman on this team. Roberts
is going to be 35 in October, and
over the years he’s,lost a step or
two, which could be deadly for a
defenseman. With the exception
of the last few games in the
Washington series, he really
didn’t have a great playoff year.
T aglianetti was a key member
of the Pens’ first Cup-winning
team, but injuries kept him out
the second half of the 1991-92
season, and he missed all of this
year’s playoffs. In his two years
here he’s suffered a collapsed

lung, foot injuries and back '

surgery. At 29 and coming off

surgery, one has to wonder how

effective he’s going to be.
Unlike their situation at goal,

the Penguins have a surplus of
defensemen. Veterans Jeff
Chychrun and Grant Jennings
might fill in the gaps. The Pens
also have Bryan Fogarty, Todd
Nelson, Jamie Heward and Paul
Laus in the minors. Any of them
might be able to step into the
Penguin lineup next season.
-The Penguins also made
some additions to the roster last
week. . They drafted
Czechoslovakian center Martin
Straka with their first—round
selection in last Saturday’s entry
draft. The 5-foot-10-inch, 178-
pound center was the 19th overall
"pick in the first round.

11

 

According to TbeHocleeyNews,
Straka is one of the fastest players
in this year’s draft. He is a skilled
player who netted 23 goals and
24 assists in 36 games last season
in his homeland.

Straka is expected to start next
season with the Pens, which
could be crucial since veteran
centers Bryan Trottier and Jiri
Hrdina are both contemplating
retirement.

The Penguins selected
defensive defensemenwith their

THE PIT!‘ NEWS, Wednesday, June 24, 1992

“so it's going to be very
competitive. We lost guys who’ve
contributed for four years, like
Nick [Liberatil, Tim lSobelmanl,
but I do think that some of the
guys we’ve recruited will be able
to ﬁll in for our losses and
contribute.”

lntLiberati and Sobelman the
Panthers lost two of last year’s
most important team assets.

Sobelman was a steady force
in goal all season, while
midfielder Liberati provided Pitt
with both skill and inspiration
and according to Luxbacher
was “the heart and soul of the
team.”

While Luxbacher admits both
will be missed, there’s plenty of
hope on the horizon.

“I think we have some people
who can step in — people who
maybe were in the shadows last
year — to make their mark.”

Included as some players
Luxbacher said he hopes will
“make their mark” and raise their
game another level are Eric Prex,
junior midfielder Ted" Noethling,

senior captain }.R.Perdue, »
. goaltenders Kirk Brodows and

Dan Martino and junior forward
John Lopus, who the Pitt coach
said he feels will improve when
given more responsibility as a
team leader.

“John is a very talented player
who played on and off last year,”
Luxbacher said. “He has the
ability to be a very good player.

“Put into that role of
responsibility— as someone who

Wis I more than a player, off the

—“‘béric'l'1‘lilling’in for somebody —

I think he’ll respond; maybe
better than some other players
that we lost.”

Most of the returning Panthers
are spending the summer playing
24—and-under club soccer in the
Pittsburgh area.

Other players, like Prex, last
year’s leading scorer as a first-
year athlete, are participating in
the same Beadling program as

BEEHIVE

this year’s recruits.

It is time spent playing in the
summer leagues that provides
returning players with the best
opportunity for improvement,
according to Luxbacher.

“Your improvement is going to
be‘ made in the off-season,”
Luxbacher said. “The players all
have a summer program they’re
supposed to follow.”

He added that those not
working in the off—season may
find themselves out of playing
time.

“The competition is so
competitive that if they don’t do
lsummerworkoutsl, they’re going
to slide behind someone else.”

Despite the last—place finish a
season ago, Luxbacher contends
that “down through the lineup” it
was the strongest team he’s had
at Pitt.

He added that the difference
between the elite and the not-so-
elite was not very much. A

Evidence in the form of close-
but-no-cigar league games
support this contention. Pitt lost
to league champ Seton Hall, 2-1,
and was beaten in overtime by
Villanova by the same margin.
Both games were on the road.
The Panthers also tied Big East
runner-up St. John’s, 1-1.

“We’re not that far away,”
Luxbacher said. “It’s not like we’re
getting beat 4- or 5-0 by the top
teams. We're not.

“But that little difference is a
big difference in terms of making
it up," he added.

The formula for making up that
difference in the coming year is
the combination of talented
players and consistent team play.

“You need talent,” Luxbacher
said. “You can’t do it with mirrors.

“With our team, it has to be a
collected effort. Without a big-
gun player who can decide a
game, we have to work well as a
unit. If we get everyone working
on doing the little things better,
we'll be right there.”

Pens

Travis Thiessen. In the
fourth round, offensive
defenseman Todd Klassen
of Canada was drafted.
Rounding out the top five
was goalie Philippe
DeRouville, another

‘Canadian.

°Last year’s first overall
pick in the draft, Eric
Lindros, has finally been
tradedbyQuebec. To which
team he is dealt is Still
undecided.

Quebec supposedly
traded Lindros to the
Philadelphia Flyers on
Saturday morning. At that
time, the New York Rangers
must have made Quebec
an offer they couldn’t refuse,
because the Nordiques then
decided to send Lindros to
New York.

Philadelphia cried foul,
so an arbitrator has been
called in to decide which
team gets him. If it’s the
Flyers, Ron Hextall, Steve
Duchesne, Mike Ricci, Rod
Brind’Amour, draft picks
and anywhere from $8
million to $20 million could
go to Quebec.

If the deal is made with
the Rangers, John
Vanbiesbrouck, Sergei
Nemchinov, Tony Amonte
and possibly Norris Trophy
winner Brian Leetch would
be sent to the Nordiques,

«along with draft picks and

cash. All these players are
just speculation though,
because the NHL will not
release the names of the
trade candidates.

The real question is if
Lindros is worth that much.
He will be a star in the NHL,

.but not a star of the Mario

Lemieux/Wayne Gretzky
class. At best, he will be
more of a Mark Messier/
Kevin Stevens kind of
player. That kind of player
is great to have on a team,
but not at the price Quebec
is asking.

 
 

NBA

land the coveted Wizard who
slips way down in the draft,
courtesy of the above team’s
myriad of troubles. Williams’
handle is amazing, as is his quick
release and deadly range. He
should start at small forward and
excel under new coach Doug
Moe’s passing system.

10. Atlanta Hawks —- Todd Day,
6-8, Arkansas. Last year the Hawks
traded their point guard so they
could move up to land Stacey
Augmon (an all-rookie team
selection). This year they move
this pick to land BJ. Armstrong
from the Bulls — one of many
rumors that have been circulating.
If they don’t make a deal, the

Hawks would love to see Walt’

still around but will opt for the
“full-throttle gazelle,” who seems
to have put his past behind him
and could be an impact player.

11. Houston Rockets — Malik
Sealy, 6-8, St. John’s. Even with
the massive trade rumors that
have been swirling regarding
nearly everyone and the Rockets,
all indications point to their need

for a slashing small forward, and‘

sleek Malik ﬁts that description.
12. Miami Heat — Clarence
Weatherspoon, '6-7, Southern
Mississippi The Heat need help
on the boards, and Spoon is a
wide-body who can stick the 15-
footer as well; Some teams love
him, others are disinterested.
13. Denver Nuggets — Robert
Horry, 6-9, Alabama- Another
gazelle who should combine with
Ellis and Motumbo to give Denver
one of the quickest and most
athletic frontcourts in the league.
He needs to eliminate bad shots
but can stick a jumper and is a
great shot-blocker and leaper.
14. Indiana Pacers — Don
McLean, 6-10, UCLA. The Pacers
have the worst pick in the draft
and are desperately trying to
unload it. Derek Harper and
Randy White from Dallas for
Michael Williams and this pick
seems likely, but the Pacers have
to sign Williams soon to do it. If
not, the Pacers draft the sweet-
shooting McLean to add frontcourt
depth and scoring punch.

15. LosAngeles Iakers— Bryan

Stith, 6-5, UVA. The Lakers need
a lot of scoring help and might
choose Tracy Murray, but the
feeling here is that Stith is a
grinder. and a clutch performer
who can rebound and score in
bunches.The Lakers, too, are in
the Monty Hall Zone, looking to
make a deal. Also, we have the
emergence of the Anthony Peeler
crime report. From here on, every
team would like his skills but not
his left jab.
16. Los Angeles Clippers —
Doug Christie, 6-6, Pepperdine.
A risky pick because of his shaky
knee, but he’s played well in the
camps and his stock has risen.
He’sa pure shooter who can
score inside and out and had a
huge senior year.
17. Seattle Supersonics —
Byron Houston, 6-5, Oklahoma
State. Plummeted like the ruble
after measuring in at 6-4 and had
a poor camp performance. Seattle
covets big boys like this, and
Houston has a ferocious mean
streak and a soft touch.
18. San Antonio Spurs — Lee
Mayberry, 6-2, Arkansas. Trade
rumors swirling here as well, as
the Spurs may finally be
disgruntled with the “tender” Rod
Strickland.‘
19. Detroit Pistons — Tracy
Murray, 6-8, UCLA. The Pistons
need scoring, and Murray can
light ‘em up. 3
20. New York Knicks, —
Anthony Peeler, 6-4, Missouri. A
perfect head case for aspirin city.
He has great range and scoring
ability and improved defensively
in a super senior season.
21. Boston Celtics — Elmore
Spencer, 7-1, UNLV. A near clone
of Robert Parish (minus the
baseline turnaround jumper). The
Celts are old up front, and
Spencer’s fresh legs are for hire.
22. Phoenix Suns — Sean
Rooks, 6-10, Arizona. Now
Barkley’s team, the Suns are
smiling and smelling silver but
need depth up front. Rooks can
score but not rebound; Sir Charles
will‘handle that. I
23. UtahJazz—— Oliver Miller, 6-_
10,'Arkansas. Three hogs go in
round one as the Jazz add a lot of
prime beef with the shot-blocking
Miller. The Jazz needs a real
small forward to move forward
but chooses the Miller for his size
and hopes he pans out as Mark
Eaton’s heir.
24. Golden State Warriors —
Marlon Maxey, 6-8, UTEP. MVP
at the Portsmouth Classic and
has bumped himself into the first
round. Big—time rebounder and
monster dunker. Can’t shoot but
can bang.
25. L.A. Clippers , — Randy
Woods, 6-0, LaSalle. Pure stroker
whom the Clips just love. Never
saw a shot he didn’t like.
26. Portland Trailblazers --
Terrell Lowery, 6-3, Loyola-
Marymount. Another gunner who
seems like he’s been in college
forever, but Portland might trade
its entire frontcourt in exchange
for Akeem.
27. Chicago Bulls —— Hubert
Davis, 6-3, North Carolina. A
smooth shooter who can’t shoot
off the dribble. Georgia Tech
guard Jon Barry might go here as
the obvious replacement forjohn
Paxson.

Joseph Usher, a sophomore
from Savannah, had a problem.

He couldn't ﬁgure out why his
pre~calculus graduate teaching
assistant kept talking about
“Zaire” in his math class.

Within a week, Usher ﬁgured
outthat his Oriental GTA‘was
saying “zero.” '

Many university faculty
members and the dean of the
graduate school said students

 

 

and GLAS.

“It’s been a problem for many
years,” said Marshall Darley, the
graduate coordinator for the
botany department. Darley, who
has been with the department
for 21 years, said his department
tries to combat the problem by
only hiring GLAS with very high
TOEFL scores, a test of English
proficiency for international
students.

After two Phi Delta Theta
pledges beat a_‘ lion’ with a
manhole cover March 19, one of
the UF students said he received
a beating himself— but not from
