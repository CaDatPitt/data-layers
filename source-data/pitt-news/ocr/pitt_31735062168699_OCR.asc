Critcl1fieldDoubts That

Out Of State Ratio
Will Be Maintained

“We’ve been doing everything
we possibly can to maintain last
year’s out-of-state students per-
centage (30 per cent), but we’re
not going to do it,” announced
Jack B. Critchﬁeld, University
dean of admissions.

WRITERS WANTED

The staff of the Pitt News
invites all those interested in
working on the newspaper staff
to meet in 411 SU tonight or
Wednesday night between 8:30
and 9:30. Students who have
never worked on a publication

before are encouraged to visit »

the_ news ‘room at these times

applied to Pitt after Feb. 1, and
by this time this year, we’ll -have
no room.” ‘

He stated that there has been

an increase in applications from .

in-state students but no increase
in out-of-state applications.

At this time last year, accord-
ing to Critchﬁeld, the Admissions
Office had received 2,450 applica-
tions, whereas this year over 4,-

.700 applications have been re-

ceived. There is an approximate
maximum of 1,700 places in Lib-
eral Arts and 300 in Engineer-
ing to be ﬁlled in the freshman
class. Six hundreds applications
have ‘already been accepted, as

honors admits, all of whom are _

in the upper 10 per cent of their
high school class.

Critchﬁeld stated that applica-
tions are still being received at
the rate of 100 to 125 a_day and
that 2,800 requests for housing
have been received. This has cre-
ated “a real problem,” said
Critchﬁeld. _

He stated that “everyone wants
to maintain out-of-state student
enrollment, but we are handicap-
ped by a lack of dorm space. If
we gave all our dorm space to
out-of-state students, We’d be
denying admission to better qual-
iﬁed Pennsylvania students.”

“We are trying," he continued,
“as best we can to select students
who will be good for Pitt, who
will participate in extra-curricu-
lar activities and be enthusiastic
about Pitt. It’s easy to predict a
student’s ability to succeed, but
difficult to predict attitude-wise
and motivation-wise whether he
will succeed. ‘

“We are trying,” Critchﬁeld
concluded, “to be selective in
every possible way.”

Pitt Pharmacologists
Investigate New Drug

Two investigators from -the
University's Department of Phar-
macology in the School of Phar-
macy recently showed the abil-
ity of the drug phenforrnin hy-
drochloride to protect the lives
of experimental animals subject-
ed prolonged exposurepiat a _sim-
ulated 29,000 feet altitude.

Results of the experiments were
reported by Dr. Joseph‘P. Buck-
ley, professor of pharmacology,
and Dr. Robert  Powell, cur-

rently assistant professor of phar-_

macology at the University of
Cincinnati’s School of Pharmacy.
The report was presented at the

_annual_meeting of the American"

 

 Unger andsadow, pub-V-

In the experiments, the ani-
mals were exposed _to a low-
oxygen environment for one hour
each dayfor two to three weeks.
During the period, the drug pro-
tected the animals from 1ow-oxy-
gen, tension of high altitudes by
maintaining a near-normal arteri-
ai blood pressure. The drug also
maintained a near-normal oxy-
gen, carbon dioxide, and acid-
base balance in the arterial blood.

' The experimental work ‘has car-
ried on for the past two and a
half years under the National
Aeronautics and Space Adminis-
tration grant and was suggested
by scientiﬁc papers by Steiner,

Ardrev’s New Views

 About Vietnam, World
 Startle Entire Nation

by MIKE KELLER
We don’t stand a Chinaman’s chance of winning in Viet-
nam. Jews don’t exist. Gentlemen prefer bonds. Sex isn’t
everything. These are just a few of the striking ideas pro-
ferred by ex-playwright Robert Ardrey in his new book,
The Territorial Imperative. Ardrey has turned his attention

6%‘ 17

from Broadway theatre to the human drama, and his in
and interesting book is raising eyebrows and uproar from Wines-
burgh, Ohio, to Aku Aku. _

‘ Basing his book on the most recent ﬁndings of the “new” bio-
logy, Ardrey declares that man, like other animals, is acting out a
part written in his bones by’ evolution. All life, says Ardrey, is driven
by the “territorial imperative”—the instinctive need to “gain, main-
tain, and defend the exclusive right to a piece of property.” Drawing
from hundreds of studies of such animals as the Uganda kob and the
Planarian worm, the howler monkey and the satin bowerbird, Ardrey
concludes that real estate is more important to man than anything-—

‘. .even sex. “How many men have you known,” asks Ardrey, “who

died for their country? And how many for a woman?”
According to Ardrey, the “territorial imperative” is a major

. cause of war, which arises chieﬂy from “the failure of an intruding
_power correctly to estimate the defensive resources of a territorial

defender.” The landlord almost always wins. Even in the jungle, vic-
tory goes to the righteous rather than to the strong. Unless the in-

‘ . truder is willing to make fantastic sacriﬁces to overcome the proprie-

tor’s inherent advantages, he will probably only accomplish the op-

5 posite of his objectives: since “hazard increases amity,” ..the Arab
‘League acutally strengthens Israel, and U. S. intervention only re-

inforces the Viet Cong. . ~
The Territorial Imperative is an explosive and"”thought-proVok-
ing book. With extinction just around the comer, we cannot ignore

Theories Compare

  Animals and Humans

In Evo1ution’s Chain

by PRISCILLA ALVARDADO .
Konrad Lorenz's On Aggression is one of the most talk-
ed -about non-ﬁctional books in recent months. In his excit-
citing narrative, Lorenz presents several new theories about

animal and human behavior, based on his observations and\
experiments with animals and their aggressive instincts.

Lorenz reminds us that evolution is not a process which has
occurred, but rather a process which is occurring. Is man the link
between lower animals and a more highly evolved human being?
Aggression in most animals rarely.becomes lethal. Lorenz suggests
this is due to inhibiting mechanisms which prevent one individual
from killing another.

What has happened to man, the highest rung on the evolutionary
ladder, that he apparently has the smallest degree of this inhibition
that exists among animals? Lorenz says that aggression is essential

_ to survival, but man has misused this potentially protective and crea-

tive drive, developing bigger, faster, more-effective ways of killing,
which we all know could end in almost total annihilation of the
human race. The great hope, of course, is that these same mental
creative powers could be channeled constructively.

Lorenz is trying to shed some light on the development of be
havior in animals and humans through which a greater understand-
ing of why man is aggressive could lead him to a new attitude of
how to use and direct his aggression. Rather than being the only
group that has notdeveloped inhibiting mechanisms against aggres-
sion, would.n’t man prefer to be known as the only species that was.
able to predestine his own evolution through thoughtful considera-
tion of how to protect and preserve the human race? This presents
a tremendous responsibility to the present generation, but also a‘
great and exciting challenge. Whether man will accept this challenge
is_ debatable; to reject it is unthinkable!

its question. Whether we can sub-

er morality without territory is
possible, may well be the cru-

cial issue of our time.

Harris’ call -for students to send
their draft cards back to their
local boards in protest. against
the war.

While the moderates try to add
further signatures to their letter,

?‘be noted that some of us

’ here are pessimistic concern-
ing the future of Pitt. The
"recent utterances of Dean
of Admissions Jack Critch-
-ﬁeld (see page one) some of
‘us feel bodes ‘ill for Alma
Mater.

Critchﬁeld has said that

: lier denials, the ratio of out-
' of-state students will most
likely not be maintained af-
ter all, that preference will
now be given to state resi-
dents. Mother Pitt, we must
remember, has got to tend
-to her own state’s chillun
first, and maybe, just maybe,
afew foreigners can sneak
_in the back way.

The rationale for this phil-
-osophy is simply that Pitt
“owes something” to Penn-
Jsylvania. Indeed Pitt does,
;but is it necessary for the
University to academically
prostitute itself and be trans-
--formed into a service station
for the mass education of
underprivileged Pennsylvani-
ans? Couldn’t it have been

          
    
         
        
      
     
      
        
    
       
     
   
 
          
    
      
    

   
 
 

say, 10 to 20 per cent of each
-freshman class be composed
5 of such people at the present
in-st_ate_ tuition? Did Pitt
have to sacriﬁce virtually all
.out-of-state students to sati-
‘ate the demands of the Com-
‘monwealth?

_ NO GREAT institution of
-higher learning merely ca-
_ters to the area it -happens
-to, be in. A great university
has a commensurately great-
fer obligation to the nation,
and a cosmopolitan student
body is essential. V

sonable complaints that the soap box was silent. In years past candidates
 have scurried about getting their petitions signed and talked to their

V with these two candidates representing divergent view points, campaign de-

it bates could easily degenerate into series of personality ‘attacks.

On a college campus of this stature it should be superfluous to say

“ that political campaigns should be centered on issues not people. But the

experience of last year’s presidential debates show that a warning is need-

So that no one can say there were no issues, The Pitt News would like
to throw out these topics for discussion: -

i > Role of the Non-Resident: How can Student Government break down
barriers between non-residents and dorm students? The Commuter Asso-
ciation, begun this year, has been generally ineffective in organizing stu-
dent opinion, yet the recent changes in the cafeteria services have the non-
residents excited. Leadership is badly needed in this area.

 The Demise Ahead ‘

Out-of-State Doom

' by Alan Disler

al predilection for devil the-
ories, but I fear that aca-
demically pernicious motives

. account for Pitt’s new state-

relatedness. What follows is
a product of ,,my own fertile
imagination, with no real
evidence to support it, but is
rational and deserves, I feel,
to be expressed.

The state aid which is
called for under the new sys-
tem mainly goes towards
making up the difference be-
tween the stari/dard $1,600
tuition, and the $450 in-state
tuition.‘ It would stand to
reason, then, that the more
in-state students the Univer-
sity enrolls, the more guar-
anteed income the Universi-
ty receives.

THE LESS out-of-state
students, the less money paid
out in scholarships, or rath-
er, the less money credited
as scholarships. Also, there
would be no bother of de-
layed payments through the
tuition plan, if_ virtually
everyone was paying on only
$450 a year tuition. The Uni-
versity would receive more
instant cash with a great
predominance of state-subsi-
dized Pennsylvania students.

It is interesting, also, to
note that before, he was ap-
pointed acting chancellor, Dr.
Kurtzman was Vice-Chancel-
lor for Finance, and charged
with getting the University
out of the red. Also, Dr.
Kurtzman was instrumental
in ironing out the state-re-
latedness system with the
legislature last summer.

Rumor has it that the
$100 a term out-of-state fee
will be eradicated next year.
Aside from .-the fact this
wretched fee should have
been done away with last
year, it doesn’t look like that
in the future there will be
many out-of-staters for this
reduction to appease.

or cooperate with other major student organizations "such as Men’s Dorm

Council, Interfraternity Council or Associated Women Students. It has
often been argued that nine autonomous student organizations exist on

this campus; is this an evil to be cured?

 

 

> SG and The Administration: This topic is often a bone of contention.
but something that is rarely openly discussed. It would be of moment to
hear the candidates articulate their feelings as to where cooperation ends
and submission to administrative control begins. Likewise it would be im-
portant to hear how what means they would employ _do express their dis-
agreement with administrative decisions.

> Activities Fee Allocations: In the past year arguments were heard
on the one side that students were not competent to decide which organ-
izations deserve funds. Others argued that students could do the job and
that in fact -there was too much administrative control of activities fee dis-

tribution. Either through platforms or speeches the presidential hopefuls

should state their opinion on this subject. ,

When Ruskay and Frederick meet head on we hope that the issues
cited above will be debated. Some will try and talk personality under the
guise of discussion of qualification. But mastery of subject and public

stands are in the final analysis the most crucial qualifications. We are sure

that a simple discussion of issues will ‘make the voter’s choice quite clear.

  Behavior at Film

Editor, Pitt News:

In the past many people from
the Oakland area have come to
Ciapp Hall on Friday nights to
see the free Student Union mo-
vies. In order to assure the ad-
mission of more Pitt students,
last Friday night, at the showing
of Tom Jones, SU members at-
tempted to check for ID cards.
By the conclusion of the early
show a few hundred students
had crowded up against all the
exits and had forced their way

into the hall before anyone left.‘

At the front doors, the students,
pushing and shoving and acting
like wild mob, trampled people
in their mad rush for seats.
Quite a few "students enjoyed this
deﬁance of order by shouting in
unison, “Go! Go!,” to the peo-
ple ﬁghting their way. through
the doors. If an emergency such
as a ﬁre had developed, very
few of us would have been able
to get out.

We feel your safety and com-.

fort comes ﬁrst and ask for your
cooperation in the future.

Poor Cafeteria
Service Attacked

Editor, Pitt News:

Soon, all of us will be talking
about New Year’s Resolutions. I
have one suggestion for Pitt:

The other day I was waiting
in the jammed cafeteria line for

a cup of hot chocolate. The man.

ahead of me had books in one
hand and his wallet "and a cup
of coffee in the other. He almost
reached the cash register. Poor

‘man! He spilled coffee all over

the ‘floor. ' '
When he asked the woman be

Ahindthe counter for a reﬁll, he —

said, “What kind of cafeteria is
this? Can’t_ you even offer peo-
ple trays?” ‘

,The:; suite  

 

yelled to someone in the, back
room, “There’s a man moaning
about trays. Would you please
satisfy him and get him a tray?”

Now here is my question: Do
you have to be scowled at and»
be called a moaner because you

ask ’for a tray? It wasn’t always I

like that. I remember when there
were traysand turkey sandwich-
es ‘available at 6:15. I've been at-
tending evening classes at Pitt
for three years. i

I work, so I must rush to
school ,hoping to ﬁnd a sandwich
before 6:30. Last week at 6:15,
there salomi sandwiches were on
the shelf. The grill had been
turned off.

On down the line were a few
dried-out pieces of peach pie and
paper plates of hard. cookies
Many studentswere in the cafe-
teria. It was hard to ﬁnd a seat.

As I sipped my dinner—hot
chocolate and three cookies —-- I
wondered what kind of sit-in or

nose.

“I don’t think it had any effect
on Cuba,” said Johnson. “It look-
ed. like he got beat bad, but he

, wrestled well. He made some real
good moves. "I was surprised-to
see Milone at 130, but it really
didn’t matter.” ,

Milone scored all his points in
the second period, getting -Cuba
in a predicament, near the very
end. Larry escaped=.'ea.rly'in the
third period, but he couldn’t
score anything‘ else.

The ﬁnal member of TeInple’s

' lightweigh trio was sophomore
Dave Pruzanski at 137. He wast-
ed little time, pinning Bill Welli-

er 16 seconds before the end of _

the ﬁrst period.

The wrestlers’ ﬁrst win didn’t’
come until the 177 match when
Al Traunsteiner, who moved up
from 167, decisioned Roy Resav-
age, 5-4.

“Al did a, real good job,” said
Johnson afterwards. “He was
hustling all the way. That was
the only way he won—by hus-
ﬂing.» .

Traunsteiner managed to over-
come Resavage’s 3-0 lead by es-
caping midway through the sec-
ond period and then taking Re
savage down shortly before the

close of the period. Al scored his »

winning points early in the last
period with a reversal, then held
on to win after Resavage es-
caped with 1:45 remaining.

The only other. Win for the
wrestlers was provided by Terry
Hoover in the 191 class with a

6-3 decision over Bob Reistrom. '

Coach Johnson felt Hoover look-

. ed “pretty good, but I "wish he

had moved a little better.”

Johnson probably was referring
to the third period when Hoover
was having difficulty maneuver-
ing with Reistrom after the Tem-
ple wrestler had escaped with
2:54 left in the match. In that
remaining time no points were
scored.

Probably the closest match of
the afternoon was the Jim Rhone-
Eci Reinoso hookup at 160, with
Reinoso taking an 8-6 decision.

A big controversy centered
around a technical violation call-
ed on Rhone midway through the
ﬁrst period for slamming, giving
Temple one point.

“The one point didn’t make
any difference in the match,” ex-
plained Johnson. “It’s just that it
was a. ﬁve point move by Rhone.
Besides the takedown, he had the
guy on his back for an easy pin.”

At, any rate, Rhone and the
others will need all the ﬁve point

moves they can. get _when they

Expects Better Things Ahead I

by GEORGE LIES
It was well past midnight before Len Kalata, a disap-
pointed basketball player, went to bed. In his mind, he was
replaying Saturday night’s Syracuse game over and over
again. The images were mostly missed opportunities.

Now In Open, Kal

Yet this meat packer’s son from
Allentown Central Catholic feels
there are better things to come.
And despite the Panthers’ last
two losses, there was evidence
that he may be right. For the
team had played ﬁne control bas-
ketball and had shot better than -
50 per cent from the ﬂoor each
night, but its record was still in
the red.

Maybe it was sophomoric ‘opti-
mism but before the Christmas
vacation Kalata had said, “I think
we’ll come back _in the second-

, half of the year because we have - ~

improved in our last two games
(Rutgers and Duquesne).”

The team has improved, there
is no doubt, but they seemed to
condense everything into the ﬁrst-
half of each game. And in the
ﬁnal ‘20 minutes of the game . . .
“we all stood around,” said Kala}-
ta, “all ﬁve of us.

“We just seem to take it easy
when we have a lead,” he said.

Without saying it in words,
Kalata probably had been think-
ing about the 16 point lead that
had vanished in the last eight
minutes against William and ,
Mary and about the numerous
half-time leads the Panthers had
blown. ‘ ,

Intrying to come-up with awin-
ner, Timmons has made changes
and one change involved Kalata.

Previously on the basketball
ﬂoor, he found problems with
taller and stronger forwards. Ka-
lata has an instinctive eye for the
nets, but he had trouble getting
in the open" and he had trouble
under the boards with the big
fellows. .

Then Timmons moved the 6-3,
175-pounder to a guard position
and Kalata started to shoot reg- '
ularly and now averages about
13 points a game. Saturday night,
he hit on six of eight ﬁeld goal
attempts." ’

“They muscle him under the

boards,” Timmons said, “and so

« — CIVIL ENGINEERS -—

I worked him in at guard. Kalata

doesn’t have the strength neces-

sary to go against the taller boys.
. He uses ﬁnesse to score. And if
he gets that step on his defender,
he’ll go because he has that
quickness.”

To ﬁnesse or not is one thing,
but Kalata uses a most unortho-
doxsmeans to score. He uses a
sort-of-two-handed - over-the-head-
semi-jump-shot, tilting his body
but not his hands in the direc-
tion of the wind.

He doesn’t have a set pattern
but if the wind blows in the right

‘direction, Kalata’s shooting is

something to watch.-

IT’S A NORTH WIND THAT BLOWS N0 G001)

Crushed between the twin millstones of January
weather and ﬁnal exams,-you are saved from total ‘des-
pair, poor devils, only by the knowledge that winter vaca-‘
tion will soon be here. ,

Where will you go this year? Will it be Florida again,
or are. you tired of jails ? Then how about Puerto Rico?

A most excellent notion, say I. A balmy and bounteous -
island with long white beaches and blue, blue skies and’
green, healing seas. And, most pleasant of all, the warm - -

and gracious people of Puerto -Rico! You don’t even have
to know Spanish to communicate with this friendly folk.
Just learn three simple phrases and you'll get along
splendidly: “Buenos dias” which means “Good morning,"

“Gracias” which means “Thank you,” and “Que sera 

sera” which means “Your llama is on my foot.”

4 _ In order to help you enjoy the fabled land of Puerto .
Rico. it would be well for me to supply a bit of historical A
background. (It‘would also be well for me to say a few ‘

words about Personna Super Stainless Steel Blades be-

cause the makers of Personna Super Stainless Steel ‘

Blades pay me to write this column and they are inclined.
to sulk if I omit to mention their product. Of course, they
don’t stay gloomy long, for they are kindly, cheery men
fond of Morris dancing, spelling bees, and temperance

punch—ﬁne, upright types, as true and gleaming and -

durable as the blades they make. And if you've tried
Personna’s, you know how true and gleaming and durable
that is !‘And if you haven't tried Personna’s, poor devil,
you’ve cheated both your purse and face, for Personna’s
last and last, shave after luxury shave, close, clean, nick-
less, hackless, tugless, gougeless, scratchless, matchless.
Personna Super Stainless Steel Blades come in Double
Edge or Injector style and are made only by the makers
of Personna Super Stainless Steel Blades.)

But I digress. Back to the history of Puerto Rico. The-
island was discovered by that popular discoverer Chris-
topher Columbus. Incidentally, considering’ Columbus’
popularity, it’s odd we know so little about him. What do
we really know? Only this:

He was born in Genoa on August 25, 1451, the son of
Ralph T. Columbus, a knee-cymbal vendor, and Eleanor
(Swifty) Columbus, a low hurdler. He was an only child,
except for his ﬁve brothers and eight sisters. From early
childhood he was an avid reader and spent all his waking
hours immersed in a book. Unfortunately, there was only

one book in Genoa at the time—Care of the Horse by ‘ ’ 
Aristotle—and after 18 years of reading Care of the"

Horse, Columbus grew restless. When rumor reached
him there was another book in Madrid, off he ran as fast

as his little fat legs would carry‘ him.

Disappointment, alas, awaited him there. The only book
in Madridwas Cuidar an Cdballo, which proved to be noth-
ing more than a Spanish translation of Care of the Horse.

Then one day ‘Columbus heard from a. traveller that
there were millions of books in India, and -he was in-
stantly ablaze to set sail. Off he ran on his little fat legs
to the court of Ferdinand and Isabella (Columbus, though
more than six feet tall, was plagued with little fat legs

all his life) and, as we all know, _he persuaded the Span- ' I
ish rulers to outﬁt him with three stout ships, the Flopsy, I

the M opsy, and the Cottontall, and the rest is history!

Rico. So get packed and get going! You’ll love it! Stroll the
beaches, swim the coves, breathe the fragrance, of hibiscus
and bougainvillea. And remember always that the friendly
Puerto Ricans are delighted to show you their customs,

teach you their language. Why, I’ll wager you'll soon know "

far more Spanish than the three basic phrases. You'll know
“H asta la m'sta”which means “See you later.” “Por favor’’
which means “Please,” and “El tren se paré en las esta-
cion” which means “Your llama has eaten my passport”,

  p Students Boycott, Picket
In “Food Price” War

WASHINGTON, D. C. (CPS) — Taking a hint from
last fall’s housewives’ boycotts of supermarkets, students
-have begun to demand power to determine the cost of food

San Francisco held successful boycotts of their campus serv-
ices last month to protest rising prices.

After weeks of negotiations with
cafeteria administrators, Hunter
students broke off talks with the
charge that “the cafeteria man-
agement appears to hold the stu-
dents in contemp .”

They claimed that the food
service, supposed to be a. non-
proﬁt organization, was actually

_ operating at a proﬁt and was
if’ charging higher prices than at

other New York City college cafe- _

terias.“ The cafeteria supervisor
explained that her hamburgers
cost more than those at nearby
City College of New York be-
cause the CCNY hamburgers
:. ‘ weigh less. A
I ‘“ Nevertheless, after three days
of boycotts against the cafeteria,
the students were given across-
the-board price reductions, and
the administration agreed to sub-
sidize any ﬁnancial loss the cafe-
‘ teria might incur. A student-fad
ulty “Kitchen Cabinet” was also
formed to recommend new price
scales, to examine the cafeteria
books, and to keep track of food
. service policy.
L “We ‘are actually running our
, own cafeteria,” committee mem-
’ ber A1 Handel said. “This was
our ultimate goal—to have stu-
' dents determine cafeteria prices
and policy.”

Cafeteria directors at San Fran-
cisco State College faced a two-
front battle, as students protest-
ed a 15 per cent increase in food
prices and a union of student
cafeteria employees demanded a

Nursing School
H Receives Grant,

 
 

Last month the University's
School of Nursing received a $15,-
750 grant from the US Depart-
ment of Health, Education and
Welfare to provide instruction in
nutrition improvement in patient
care. '

A series of workshops will be
conducted here from March
through July for hospital dieti-
cians and other interested per-
sons.

sistant professor of nutrition, and

hike in hourly wages. ‘

The employees got their raise,
but students carried out a Nine-L

clay Students for a Democratic’

Society-led boycott when the cafe-
teria’s governing board refused
to accept their demands for a 20
per cent price reduction. During
the boycott, called “90 per cent
effective” by its leaders, an asso-
ciation of married students’ wives
and the California Committee to
Legalize Abortion sold food in
the union which undercut the
cafeteria prices. “

Despite a subsequent “interim”
10 per cent cut in prices, stu-
dents continued the boycott until
the Christmas recess. a

- In an unofficial vote, students
also demanded majority repre-
sentation on the food service's
managing board. At present, the
board inchides ﬁve students, two
faculty members, and three ad-
ministrative representatives. ‘

Since the end of Christmas va-
cation, students have been eating
at the cafeteria, While the boy-
cott committee ‘seeks to organize
an official vote on the organiza-
tion of the cafeteria’s managing
board. The cafeteria management
is conducting a study of prices,
student attitudes, and possibil-
ities for change.

Last year,

thousands of
lawyers, bankers,

accountants , 
engineers, doctors  
and businessmen

went back to

college.

And not inst for
the football games.

. We’d like to clear up what appears to be a

misunderstanding. It is somewhat popular

‘on campus to decry a business career on

the grounds that you stop learning once

you start working for Cliché Nuts & Bolts.

That idea is groundless.

We can’t speak for Cliché, but we can
for ourselves—Western Electric, the man-
ufacturing and supply unit of the Bell Sys-
tem. 6 out of 10 college graduates who have
joined us over the past 10 years, for exam-
ple, have continued their higher education.

How’re these for openers:

W.E.’s Tuition Refund Plan lets em-

ployees pursue degrees while work-

ing for us. Over 6 thousand have at-
tended schools in 41 states under
this plan. We refund more than $1
million in tuition costs to employees

a year.

-To name another program: advanced

engineering study, under the direc-

tion of Lehigh University, is con-
ducted at our Engineering Research

Center in Princeton, N. J. Selected
employees are sent there from all
over the country for a year’s concen-
trated study leading to a master’
degree. ’ _ '
You get the idea. We’re for more learn-
ing in our business. After all, Western
Electric doesn’t make buggy whips. We
make advanced communications equip-
mcnt. And the Bell telephone network will
need even more sophisticated devices by

.the time your ﬁfth reunion rolls around.

The state of the art, never static, is where
the action is. ’

At Western Electric, what’s happening
is the excitement and satisfaction of con-
tinued doing and learning. If this happens

you’re aiming for, check us out_. And grab
