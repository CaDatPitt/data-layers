Greek night draws

Staff Report

Within 15 minutes, herds of
chattering girls had filled the Lower
Lounge, browsing Pitt’s Various
sororities during the women’s‘ night
of Meet the Greeks.

The event yesterday night,
sponsored by the Panhellenic
Association, gave interested girls
the chance to see what each sorori-
ty had to offer. 

“They give you a good idea of
the community service they do and
what they’re about,” sophomore
Randi Birge said as she looked at

displayed their pictures and Greek

letters at the individual tables that

had been decorated with balloons.
Early into the night, Alison

McBee, president of Theta’ Phi

Alpha, acknowledged that there had
already been a good turnout.

“Usually, in the spring, it’s
slow,” McBee said, “but this event
was well-publicized.”

Fraternity and Sorority Life
Coordinator Anita Triggs said that
this event works for the women.

Freshman Shellyann O’Meally
agreed with Triggs.

“I think women, especially

freshman women, want a place to

belong,” O’Meally said about the

Cathedral confuses people, county monitors asbestos

HALI FELT
‘ Staff Writer

_ Gone are the days when one could easily slip out
the door of a classroom to use a restroom on the third

ﬂoor. ‘Gone are the days when one could get from the V

ground ﬂoor of the Cathedral of Learning to any of the
ﬂoors immediately above it. And gone are the days
when one did not have to truck one’s freezing—cold,
humanities-major self up an almost vertical hill.

The Cathedral is under construction.

Anne Marie Carey, a customer service representa-
tive for the College of General Studies on the fourth
ﬂoor, said that people constantly come up to -her, ask-
ing how to get around in the building. I

“We must answer that question 50 times a day. If
you just want to get to certain rooms on the third ﬂoor,
you can use these doors,” Carey said, pointing to the
doors to the right of the front desk. “But if you want to
get to [Room] 320, you have to go all the way
around.”

The construction is an inconvenience that has

caused some students a little exasperation. Rebecca
Sheetz, an English writing major, said that getting to
class has become quite a pain.

“Say you’re trying to get to the third floor. Yougo
all the way up a stairway, only to find that that door is
blocked off. Then you have to go back down, find
another stairway, go up, and hope that it’s open. I hate
that,” Sheetz said, “especially when I’m tired and late
for class.” i ,

The construction on the second and third ﬂoors is
being done to install air. conditioning, temperature
controls and sprinklers, and to update the electrical
system in 49,c1assrooms and various ofﬁces, said Cliff
Vankirk, the; superintendent oflthe project. .

Vankirk said that all the existing ceilings and parts
of walls on the two ﬂoors have to come down, and that
the partition walls and sealed-off doorways are neces-
sary because the ceilings and walls contain asbestos.-

Asbestos is a ﬁbrous, heat—resistant mineral. used

to insulate, strengthen and ﬁreproof things like paint

and plaster. But it becomes dangerous when airborne
and can cause an increased risk of lung and chest can-

\

 

cer, as well as the lung condition asbestosis. Because
of these risks, there are strict rules that companies
must adhere to when removing the material.

And because of that, Vankirk said, the county has
to come and approve the air quality of the space.

' Dan Demoise, from facilities management, said
people have definitely had problems getting around in
the building. One disabled professor, he said, could
not get to his classroom on one of the ﬂoors under
construction during the first week of classes because
of the partitions.

Vankirk said steps have been taken to make sure
that all of the classrooms not currently being worked
on are accessible to everyone. ‘

Both Carey and Demoise simply wondered why
people weren’t informed before the construction
began. - . .

“It’s an inconvenience, I know,” said David
Gieraltowski, a supervisor with facilities management,
“but people will be happy when the AC goes in.”

Samuel Lewis, a French and film major, agreed.

“You gotta" do what you gotta do,” he said

THE PITT NEWS

Students get fair-ly good
practice with recruiters

CHRISTINE CLAUS
Staff Writer

With graduation looming over
many students’ heads, causing wor-
ries about entering the r_eal world,
any job leads are helpful.

Yesterday’s “Opportunities II
Job Fair” gave many students the
chance to speak with recruiters and
learn about various job opportuni-
ties around Pittsburgh. I

“This summer, we have a lot of
companies that are actively pursu-

' ing employees,” said Erin‘Bridgen,

special events and marketing coor-
dinator,for Career Services. .

Whether students were interest-
ed in engineering, the medical field,
the armed forces or management,
there was a_ representative ready
and waiting to~talk to them about
their futures.

“Students get to experience
talking to the recruiters and pre-
senting themselves profes’sionally,”
Bridgen said. “It lets students know
what they have to offer [a compa-
ny].”

It also allows students to get

comfortable speaking with
recruiters for the future..

“I think the job fair is a great
opportunity for students not only
looking for a job, but internships as’
well,” Bridgen said.

. Many students were dressed to
impress in suits and smiles, with
resume copies in hand.

“As long as you put yourself out
there, are prepared and are good at
a job, you can’t go wrong,” electri-

cal engineering major Brian Berke

said, ,

Open minds and the willingness
to try something new can help stu-
dents find their niches in today’s
job world. ' ‘ I

“Fm willing to try anything,”
Berke said. “We’ll see what comes

up.”

Career Services sponsored the
event, with the help of the ‘Blue &
Gold Society and Pitt’_s Alumni
Association. ,

“It’s a.way for the alumni to
keep in contact with Pitt, [as well
as] a networking event,” said
Krystle Williams, Blue & Gold
Society member.

event’s success compared to the low
turnout for the fraternity event on
Tuesday. “[Boys are] kind of sim-
ple, not to say anything negative,
but they like to kick back [and]
chill with the guys. Girls want more
of a close-knit community.”

, Senior Lindsay Woods, the cur-
rent president of the Panhellenic
Association, said she attended Meet
the Greeks when she was a "fresh-.
man. She added that the event has
changed since she first attended
because of more stereotypes associ-
ated with the MTV show “Sorority
Life.” ' _

“It’s different now — girls’ are
coming into Meet the Greeks with
more stereotypes,” Woods said. “If
girls came out, maybe their impres-
sions would be a little bit differ-

97

ent. ~
Overall, the sororities seemed
satisfied with the event. The overall
attendance reached about 80 girls.

i “I’m really happy that so many
girls came out. It looks like recruit-
ment"'i’s going to go really well this
semester,” said Sarah Cvammen,
the vice president of recruitment for

‘Delta Phi Epsilon.

, In addition to the interested
independents, Pitt men’s basketball
players Chevon Troutman and Toree
Morris, self-proclaimed members of
the -fraternity “Phi Slamma J amma,”
decided to check out Meet the
Greeks. ,.

“These girls are ' hot, man,”
Troutman said as he gazed around
the room.

Greg Heller-LaBelle and Lauren
Unger contributed to this report.

 

 

In Tl1ursday’s story, “Few tum out to meet ﬂue Greeks,” fraternities Lambda Chi Alpha .
and Phi Sigma Kappa were misidentiﬁed. The Pitt News regrets the errors. ’ '

Senate right to tablered meatlabeling 3

As part of a massive, $373 billion
spending bill approved in the U.S.
Senate yesterday, Congress decided to
table an issue near to the hearts — and
stomachs — of American consumers.

The Senate decided to delay a law
requiring country—of-origin labels on
red meats, according to a Reuters
report, for two years. But that is not
enough — the issue should be tabled
indeﬁnitely.

Two recent food crises have drawn
attention to the way food is treated and
handled: a Holstein cow that tested pos-
itive for mad cow disease, and a Beaver
County hepatitis A outbreak linked to
tainted green onions. The Holstein was
from Canada, the onions from Mexico.

Yet labeling red meats with their
nation of origin will only superﬁcially
inform people — these labels won’t
specify what the country’s standards
are, though all beef should, presum-
ably, be U.S.» Department of
Agriculture approved. Nor will they do
anything but create more food para-
noia, which might sour the public to
perfectly safe food from other coun-
tries. ~

With all the information, and mis-
information, that people are being bom-
barded with, the last thing we need is
food xenophobia. The fact is that mad
cow disease — bovine spongiform
encephalopathy — is far more of a dan-
ger to cattle than to humans. Fewer

I

than 100 cases of variant Creutzfeldt-
Jakob disease, which is human BSE,
have been reported worldwide; none of
those occurred - in the United States.
Labeling red meat as to which country
it comes from will do nothing to pre-
vent VCJ infections, which occur
because of BSE. And as the meat indus-
try recently realized, disease does not
respect national borders.

Moreover, given the public’s per-
sistent ﬁckleness, are we ready to hinge
some small nation’s economy on what
the American people think is the danger
of the day?

Many small meat manufacturers
backed this bill, saying that it would
boost their sales, while" the larger cor-
porations cite the labels as being too
costly. Both sides have a point, and one
that can be satisﬁed easily.

If the small manufacturers want
meat to be labeled with country-of-ori-
gin labels, then they should do so vol-
untarily. If large companies don’t want
to, then they shouldn’t have to. Both of
these could occur without unnecessary
lobbying and legislation.

Rather than feeding paranoia, the

government is already doing its job by
providing real, substantive information
the kind available at
www.hhs.gov/news/facts. The public
will make better decisions with the
whole storyavailable, not just a simple,
slapped-on label.

Pitt community is livingMLK’s dream

NEWSMAKER
K. Chase Patterson, Black Action Society

So often in the black community, we
ﬁnd ourselves so focused on faults and short-
comings, that we forget to praise our people
for their willingness to sacriﬁce for the suc-
cess of our community.

I believe that any individual who comes ,

to a university and devotes a large amount of
his or her time to bridging the gap that the
institution has left between cultures and
communities — while maintaining their

class work — should be commended.

People like Adolph Sims, Brian Kelly,
Charis Jones, Dulani McLaurin, Jesse
Horstmann, Lauren Williams,
Liz Culliton, Vanessa Gerideau
and so many others sacriﬁce
that which they came to this
institution for, to guarantee that
those who come after them
have a better chance for social"
and academic success.

So I believe that these few
are among those paving the
way toward accomplishing the dream. Each
of these individuals had something to do
with making this one of Pitt’s most news-
worthy Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Days. We
have been featured on KDKA and WPXI;

articles have been written in The Pitt News '

and the New Pittsburgh Courier. We are lay-
ing the golden bricks on the road tow
accomplishing King’s dream '

On Jan. 19, Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity
and the Black Action Society successfully
mobilized more than ﬁfty people, of diﬁer-
ent colors, of different backgrounds, and\ of
different beliefs. 'Ihis, to me, seemed like the
dream of, “black men and white men, Jews
and gentiles, Protestants and Catholics,” was
coming true.

Not one of them sang the song “we
have overcome,” but instead “we shall over-
come,” understanding that we are still in a
struggle to accomplish Dr. King’s dream.

To people on
the outskirts:
Live the
dream and

t \
step up.

Many of ﬂiem understand and are  to I

cope with the reality that this utopian dream
may never come true, but, as long as we con-
tinue to ﬁght and struggle toward change, we
will be productive.

So when they proclaimed, “we’re living A

King’s dream,” they were right, because
King’s goal was to motivate people toward
making these corrective changes, and we
 So we were not lying when we said, “we
are living the dream,” because there were so
many facets to the hopes and desires of this
great man, if one is accomplished, then
change has been made. ’
On Saturday, the Black
Action Society hosted an entire
day dedicated to the legacy of
King. On Sunday, the brothers of
'  Kappa Alpha Psi  host-

and, BAS and the brothers of
APA closed out a weekend full of
events with the candlelight vigil.

, This is corrective change.

For so much 'of'my life, I have followed
the teachings of King, and have realized that
I never stop learning from him. leaders on
campus and in the community are only as
strong as those who support them. We must
begin to support our black leadership here at
Pitt, in the community; we mustjoin hands.
If there are people reading this column who
believe they can be catalysts for change in
issues of ‘interracial dating, then program a
forum. If you believe you can encourage
people to participate with groups that are
comprised largely of another race, then do
so. Ifyou want black and white fraternities to
host joint events, then join one. To all of
those people standing on the outskirts of
change, I say, live the dream and step up.

The benefits of eating lunch with Holden Caulfield

When I think about my early days of reading, I writing a new program?

wonder if it was my love for reading that
isolated me or if my love for the written
word blossomed out of the isolation I
already felt. For children, there is an
acceptable level of literacy. Beyond
that, any excessive literacy makes one a
sure-fire target for bullying.

It was only late in high school and
college that I began to experience a cer-
tain amount of popular appreciation
attached to my love for books. Society
began to affirm my love for Graham

“Why should I have to take General
Writing?”

“What use is a W course, anyway?”

I hear these refrains all the time
from my friends and acquaintances who
study engineering, physics, computer
science or mathematics. . ’ -

This idea is affirmed culturally
across the United States. My parents cer-
tainly didn’t support my literary endeav-
ors, at first.

“Pick a useful, practical major,” my
mother encouraged me, “like computer

Salinger.

Even in college, though, this love
for reading sometimes draws criticism, especially
from those whose talents lie in the scientific and
mathematic areas.

“Oh, an English major? What are you going to

do with that? Anyone can be an English major,” said
my ex—boyfriend — the “ex” is there for a good rea-
son. -
Or one of my other favorites, as said by an old
friend, who studies computer science and physics,
“English major? English majors are just self-perpet-
uating. The only thing you can do with an English
major is teach other people to be English majors.”
They see reading as something valuable, but
only for its practical application. In Benedum Hall,
a sincere interest in literature is seen as a frivolous
waste of time. After all, why read the book when
you can see the movie —— and spend all the timeyou
saved studying for your next engineering exam or

science.”

All of society clamors for a quick
helping of entertainment: condensed books,
abridged versions, movies, 30-minute sitcoms.
Students in high school complain about being force-
fed the classics. What is the value of “The Grapes of
Wrath,” anyway? And what is with the turtle and the
diner scenes? If a reader doesn’t get it in the first
reading, then it must be useless or outdated.

And.it can always be made into a movie. Then
people can sit in comfortable chairs while they
shovel grocery—bag—sized containers of popcorn into
their mouths and have the director tell them what the
important parts of the book are.

It angers me to hear people decry the value of
literature; it bothers me to see the plot of “The Lord
of the Rings” be reduced to a paragraph or two.

It is literature that allows us to experience
another person’s point of view in a way that no
movie ever can. Literature unlocks the mind of the

characters and lets the reader in. This is the differ-
ence between “The Hours,” the movie, and “The
Hours,” the book. This is why the movie was just
two hours of entertainment for me, but the book
changed my life.

Part of the value of literature is that it gives
readers the chance to change their perspective by
seeing life from other people’s point of view, read-
ing the characters’ thoughts, knowing their emo-
tions, and following the story to the final page.
Through this, the reader may experience emotions
and thoughts that she has never encountered before.

The reader may also encounter emotions and
thoughts he has experienced or is experiencing and
suddenly feel a little less alone. Perhaps advanced
literacy won’t win any popularity contests, but that
doesn’t matter, because it makes the need for such
things nonexistent. Literacy makes a reader more
independent and lessens the need for outside
approval. It develops the coping mechanisms need-
ed to deal with whatever rejection or isolation may
be encountered —— I highly recommend the final
pages of “Gone With the Wind” after any breakup.

There is solace in personal writing and the writ-
ing of others: I can learn about 19th century Russia
or how it feels to be the ostracized prince of
Denmark; I can read about people just like me, who
sat seemingly alone at lunch, but who were never
really alone. There was always Holden Caulﬁeld,
Scarlett-O’Hara or Samwise Gamgee to keep us
company. ’

“Ho-Tep” a lot of fun, espite struggles

DANTE A. CIAMPAGLIA
A&E Editor

“If you’re going to see one Elvis
vs. a mummy movie this year,” direc-
tor Don Coscarelli chuckles about
his film “Bubba Ho-Tep” before
quickly turning serious. “No, honest-
ly, one of the things we don’t
acknowledge in the advertising is
thatit’s a film that’s very serious in a
lot of respects.”

This is an obvious means of
deterring people from writing off the
film as a silly, campy exercise. Most
wouldn’t read the synopsis of»
“Bubba Ho-Tep” and think that it had

some seriousness to it. Two old guys ‘

who think they’re_ Elvis and John
Kennedy fighting a mummy in a
nursing home isn’t"exact1y- “Terms of
Endearment.” —But. Coscarelli wants
audiences to know that it’s more than
a cheap, comedic horror movie.

“It’s got some silly stuff that
pretty much anyone can enjoy,” says
Coscarelli, “but it deals with other
topics like aging and death and rest
homes that you won’t get in other
movies.”

And with such content in the
film, the fight to get it made and out
there for people to see was a struggle

for this director whose previous
works include “Phantasm” and
"&Beastmaster.”

Originally a short story by Joe
Lansdale, Coscarelli came across
“Bubba Ho-Tep” in a small



horror/sci—fi bookstore because one
of the guys working there said
Lansdale’s work had “a high body
count.” “Bubba Ho-Tep” doesn’t
have the body count, but it attracted
Coscarelli all the same, thanks to
numerous elements in the story, like
the relationship between Elvis and
Kennedy, and the way Lansdale
explained the “whole latter part of
the Elvis myth.”

“It just seemed to me that the
reason there were so many Elvis
sightings after Elvis was gone was
that the fans couldn’t accept the offi-
cial record of how he died,”
Coscarelli says. “The «King wouldn’t
go out that way. And this story ‘pro-
vided away to kind of sum up the
guy’s life and give him ashot at
redemption.” . --

But as a director like Coscarelli
knows, wanting to make a project
and actually doing it are two differ-
ent things. He was faced with a story
that seemed too eccentric for mass
audiences,va tight budget and diffi-
culties in finding resources to make
the film. But, as directors also know,
there are times when luck strikes,
and their seemingly unfilmable pro-
jects get made.

This was such a case. And
Coscarelli is quick
to point to the

’ biggest gift his film
received — the par-
ticipation of Bruce
Campbell.

“We had this
question of who we
were going" to getto
play Elvis that we_
could afford who
would want to do

this,” says
Coscarelli. “We got
Bruce Campbell,

and he rose to the
occasion and gave a
fantastic perfor-
mance that I cer-
tainly didn’t know
that he had in him. I
certainly knew he
could handle the
physical comedy
. . aspects of it. But
eaily on, it became apparent that
Bruce was going to be able to make
this wor .” ~ - E

And because Campbell was on
the project, a group of effects people
from Sony Animation came onto the

theater in droves.

Coscarelli
also points to the
relationship
be t w e e n

Campbell and
Ossie _ Davis,
playing John

Kennedy, as a
positive force for
the film —— if the
two leads in a
film with only
two leads don’t
get along,,' after
all, the film is
doomed to fail-
ure.
“Bruce and
Ossie had a
bond,” Coscarelli
says. “Ossie
.keeps his
counsel, but you
‘could see when
he arrived on the
set and » Bruce
came swinging
down the hall
wearing that fat
suit and Elvis
gear ‘Hey
baby, what’s up?’
he’s in that Elvis
shtick ———-Ossie
would light up.
The two of them

ﬁlm to work on the mummy effects.
They wanted to work on the film
because Campbell was involved.
More_,.importantly, though, Coscarelli
was able to get his audiences.

Bruce Campbell is a cult figure
in modern movies. Starring in films
such as “Evil Dead,” ,“Evil Dead 2”
and “Army of Darkness,” and in tele-
vision shows like “The Adventures
of Brisco County, Jr.,” he has culti-
vated the status of B-movies star
extraordinaire. His autobiography is
even subtitled “Confessions of a B-
Movie Actor.” I ’

He’s content in this role because,
like anything that falls into the realm
of “cult,” there is a fan base that fol-
lows his every move and supports his
every venture. “Bubba Ho-Tep” is no
exception._ Coscarelli points out that
“there’s a big Bruce fan base” and
that, when they opened the film in
Dallas, it sold out numerous times
because these fans descended onthe

really had a great
- V rapport.”
Despite some difficult trials and

‘tribulations —— like an advertising

snafu in Dallas where none of the ads
for the film made it into newspapers,
in addition to the budget and
resource woes — Coscarelli places
this film high. on the list of his
favorite works.

“It’s one of my favorites. My top
three. would be the original
‘Phantasm,’ which was such a great
experience. Here we are 25 years
later, and I’ve made some of the
great friends of my life on that film,”
Coscarelli says. “I did this other
movie that very few people have
seen — called ‘Kenny and Me’ —
when I was a kid, and that’s a real
nice movie. But, boy, this ‘Bubba
Ho-Tep,’ it’s a fun movie to watch
with audiences. A ,

‘‘It’s something that I’m really
proud of. I think it’s got some lasting
value, and people seemtto really like

it.”

THE PITT NEWS

1877 has come to an end

At the end of November, due to
problems with its core members and
a lack of funds, Project 1877
closed. The “radical community
space” that housed the Pittsburgh
lndependent‘Media Center, a free
store, and numerous other projects
and community events, was also
one of the few medium-sized
venues in Pittsburgh that hosted all-
ages concerts.

Founded by 21-year-old activist
Branden Dudek, Project

named for an uprising of Pittsburgh
steel workers that occurred in that
year when their already low wages
were out once more. The entire city
rose in protest, the National Guard

_ was called in, and, more than 60

people were killed.

One of the main problems with
1877, according to Toni Bartone,
who has done work there, was that
it lacked focus, was too ambitious
and tried to juggle too many pro-
jects at once. The folks at 1877
tried to maintain a free store, food
distribution, a ‘zine library and host
all sorts of classes, as well as put on
art, dance, performance art and
music shows, all in a space that was
too small.

Bartone also mentioned how
much those who put together 1877
admired the Mr. Roboto Project, an

‘alternative’ venue in Wilkinsburg,

for its focus, organization and

longevity. She said that when the

1877 organizers encountered a

1877.
» opened in April of 2003 and was

problem, “We would ask ourselves,
‘what would Roboto do?”’ and said
that the fact that Roboto focuses on
only a few things, namely music
and a ‘zine library, is probably one
of the things that has made it so
successful. _

When, asked if rumors that the
owners of the space 1877 rented
tried to drive them out by increas-
ing the rent dra atically in order to
put in a hip art gallery like the oth-
ers that are popping up in the Penn
Avenue arts corridor, she said, “The
rent is definitely higher than it was
five years ago,” but that the con-
spiracy theories are unfounded. ‘

To the question of whether or
not there are plans to re—open 1877
in the future, she responded that,
“Nothing is concrete right now,”

but that there is still free food dis-.

tribution going on, and that people
still meet and work on projects they

started at 1877, and may reconvene

in the future. The Pittsburgh
Independent Media Center is also
alive and well. ‘

The demise of Project 1877 is
only a part of a general trend in
Pittsburgh. Club Laga’s future is
precarious, Metropol closed a few

months ago,‘and rumblings of the.

opening and closings of small and

midsize venues echo through the

city. The future ofsthe music scene
and the cultural landscapein gener-
al in Pittsburgh is uncertain.

Forget going to the comedy clubs when you play l—Ninja

I-Ninja

Developed by Argonaut
Games

Published by Namco
Playstation 2, GameCube, and

Xbox
7iX'7i‘r'7L‘r

One recent trend in video gam-
ing that I’m_ thankful for is the
quantity of good, technically sound
games that actually have a sense of
humor. “Disgaea: Hour of
Darkness” set the tone, “Mario and
Luigi: Superstar Saga” exemplifies
it, and “I—Ninja” hits it home.

As a ninja named — appropri-
ately —— Ninja, you square off
against the forces of O-Dor and
their minions — called the Rankz
— who have been wreaking havoc
all over your island. (Rankz, as in
odor? Rankz, as in “rank and file”?
It, takes alcommendable effort to

 pun twice at the same time.) You

trek through several themed stages,
each with a handful of levels and
sub-missions, preparing for the
final confrontation. ‘It sounds like
standard fare, but there’s nothing
“standard” about this experience.
For one thing, each level is
beautifully unique. Perhaps you

have to roll a giant eyeball down a

ramp while negotiating pits and Furthermore, after you’ve finisheda

moving platforms. Perhaps you
have to command a giant robot in a
boxing match against a sea monster.

- Perhaps you have to man a gun tur-

ret and shoot down battleships. I

ments and still have leftovers. The

level, youcan go back through and
complete it again, this time with a
qualifier, such as. a time limit or a
kill‘ count-. .

The graphics do their job, and
are neither spectacular nor inade-
quate. The same goes for the music,
but you’re not going to be listening
to the music. You’re going to be lis-
tening to the characters talk. You’re

going to listen to your Sensei —
whom you accidentally decapitated
at the beginning of the game —-
blather inspirational messages and
give you the low-down on each
level, or you’re going to “Ssh!” him
if you feel he’s getting too wordy
and annoying. You’re going to shout
a battle cry when you jump into the
fray, and you’re going to feel disap-
pointed after you run out of oppo-
nents and you hear poor Ninja
shout, “Must  kill  more stuff!”

If there’s one stumbling block,
it’s the controls. Three-dimensional‘
platformers are notoriously tough to
handle, and all of the tricky moves
that I—Ninja,ﬂaunts make getting

around in the game a task of pure‘

skill. While grappling and sliding
down pipes don’t take much getting
used to, tasks suchas running
across walls will give youitrouble
deep into the game.

Despite being a one—player
experience, “I-Ninja” is as enjoy-
able to watch as it is to play.
Featuring intricate attention to
detail, a classic formula and a funny
streak a mile wide, “I-Ninja” is the
“Young Frankenstein”
gaming. Mel Brooks would be
proud.

Fully restored Chaplin classic winds its way into Pittsburgh

Modern Times

Starring Charlie Chaplin

Directed by Charlie Chaplin
aaaa

Back in the ‘30s, when the citizens of industrialized
nations were feeling alienated by ﬂie monstrous increases in
the mechanization in industry and, most dramatically, war-

fare, two ﬁlms attacked the subject on each side of the ’

Atlantic.

In France, Rene Clair created “A nous la liberte,” a ﬁlm
about how assembly line capitalism can make or break you,
but is ultimately an awful beast But a few years later in
America, Charlie Chaplin thrust his Tramp character into the
world of streamlined production and specialization in
“Modern Times” and created one of the classics of world cin-
ema.

Now, this landmark comedy about society in the
depressed ‘30s has been completely restored and is march-
ing its way, red ﬂag held high in the air, into Pittsburgh
Filmmakers’ Regent Square Theater. 7

Even if someone has never heard of the ﬁlm or
of Chaplin, chances are that they have seen the
indelible image of the ﬁlm —- the Tramp wind-
ing his wrench anound nuts and bolts while
being chewed through the massive gears of a
machine. As classic — and obviously, critical of

‘30s assembly line production — as the image is,
the ﬁlm is much more than this.

While the Tramp works on the assembly line for a good
portion of the ﬁlm, there is also a commentary on the work-
ers’ movements that happened during this period

When the Tramp loses his job, he walks through the
street andnotices aﬂag——aredwarningﬂag—fall offthe
back of the truck. \V1th his heart in the right place, he rushes
to the item, picks it up and waves it high to get the truck ‘dri-
ver’s attention. At that exact moment, a legion of angry

workers turns the comer, on a collision course with the v

Tramp and his ﬂag. Oblivious to the crowd behind him, the
Tramp walks towards the tiuck, still waving the ﬂag‘, and it
now looks like he’s leading the march. The authority ﬁgures
take none too kindly to this and break up the march, busting
him for leading it. I .
This is a funny moment in the
ﬁlm —— we always

  
 
  
 
 
 
 
   
  
 

_ seem to like
reveling in the

r*’i- 

Tramp’s misfortune — but it also shows how ramshackle
Chaplin sees such marches as and how brutal he ﬁnds
authority ﬁgures, like police.

Contrasted with this political commentary is the

romance between the Tramp and a lady worker. It’s touching
and sweet, as most Chaplin. romances are — see “City
Lights” for more evidence of this. The scene where the
Tramp, as a department store guard, lets his love interest in
after hours so they can have the luxurious ﬁee-for—all they ‘so
desperately long for, is hilarious and romantic.

Also notable in this ﬁlm is that it’s generally silent,
despite being made well after the advent of sound. There are

4 a few moments of dialogue —.the Tramp actually sings at

one point, allowing audiences to hear him for the ﬁrst time
— and synched-up sound, but it’s mostly silent. Yet, the
power of the ﬁlm isn’t lost. Rather than focusing on dialogue,
we’re able to watch the ﬁlm and absorb Chaplin’s ideas and
genius. Ifthe ﬁlm were in total sound, some of the charm'and

power of the ﬁlm would be lost

Few ﬁhrrs can balance comedy, drama, social satire and
social criticism‘ well. Chaplin does it to perfection in
“Modern Times” —— in a 90-minute silent ﬁlm, no less. It’s
always a treat to see such classic, but it’s a rare pleasure to
see one on a big screen with restored picture and sound ele-
ments. Don’t miss it during its limited Pittsburgh engage-
ment.

“Modem Tmes” will be pkzying at Pittsburgh Filmmakers’
Regent Square Yheaterﬁom Jan. 23 through Jan. 29. For
 more information, call (412) 681-5449.

Panthers prepare 
to go to Syracuse

MATT SORTINO
Staff Writer

After suffering their first loss of
the season on the road against N0. 4
Connecticut Monday night, the
schedule doesn’t get any easier for
the No. 9 Panthers and first-year head
coach Jamie Dixon. _

Pitt (18—1 overall, 4-1 in the Big
East) will travel to New York tomor-
row night for a Big East showdown
with defending national champion
Syracuse (13-2, 3-1). The two teams
are currently in second and third
place, respectively, in the conference
standings.

Following a non-conference
schedule that received national criti-
cism, Pitt gave the Huskies all they
could handle despite falling short on
freshman Antonio Graves’ last-sec-
ond three-pointer. Despite dropping
from the ranks of the unbeaten, the
Panthers finally earned some respect
from the critics, but to the Panthers,
respect is no substitute for winning.

“Overall, we knew we had a

tough schedule,” said Dixon. “The
order’ in which we play these teams
doesn’t matter, either way,-it’s going
to be tough.” -

.Pitt, led by guard Carl ‘Krauser,

will try to avoid losing two games in _

a row to the Orangemen, dating back
to last year. ‘Krauser, who has
emergedfrom Brandin Knight’s shad-
ow this season, is one of four Pitt
starters averaging more than 10
points per game. ,

Krauser (15.7), Julius Page
(13.6), Jaron Brown (12.6) and fresh-

Panthers off to one of the best starts
in school history. .

“It’s unbelievable,” said Krauser.
“If you look all the way down from
the freshman up to the seniors, we
have guys that can play at different
levels. I think we are going to be bet-
ter [than last year].”

Syracuse will counter with four

of its own starters who average dou-
ble digits in the scoring department.

It’s hard to.imagine, but just four
years ago, the Pitt women’s basketball
team actually made it to the Women’s
National Invitational Tournament.
Under then—head coach Traci Waites,
the Panthers looked to be in good

~ shape, with Pittsburgh native Brooke

Stewart, Florida point guard’ Laine
Selwyn and up-and-coming center
Mandy Wittenmyer. _

However, the Panthers suffered
setbacks over the next three years and
had a combined 29-53 record, result-
ing in a disappointing senior class of
Selwyn, »Wittenmyer and Stewart.
Along with the disappointing class
came the firing of Waites. A

This summer, the Panthers hired
Agnus Berenato from Georgia Tech.
An unknown name to you and me,
Berenato came to Pitt as a, well-
respected coach not only from the
Atlantic Coast Conference, but also on‘
a national level. She had taken a
Yellow Jackets program that was down
in‘ the dumps and made them a legiti-
mate program, taking them to the
NCAA Tournament last season.

Coming into Pitt this season,
Berenato knew she would have a chal-
lenge. She had only one returning
starter in Amy Kunich, who was the
only returning player that averaged
more than five points the previous sea-
son. Haley Harguth left the team for
personal reasons, so Berenato was left
with — literally — a team of fresh-
men. . '

Last year, practices under Waites
consisted of the five starters against a
practice squad of male players, so the
few returning players hadn’t even
practiced since high school. ,

Berenato made it clear that this
was no easy task ahead of her, and she
made it publicly known that, while she
wanted to win every game, itwas like-
ly Pitt would not win a Big East game
all season, let alone make the Big East
Tournament. 1 _

After a slow start to the season, the
girls started to respond to their relent-
less coach. Heading into last. week,
Pitt had a ‘2-2 record in the conference.
No one expected Pitt to have even two
wins in the conference, but behind
great coaching and new leadership
from forward LaToya Kincaid, who is
averaging 16 points per game, the
Panthers had some hope.

Pitt lost its next two games to No.
21 Miami and, on Wednesday, to No.
23 Virginia Tech.‘ But don’t look too
deeply into these losses. You would

think an undermanned, undersized
, team like Pitt would have no chance

against these two teams, but that’s
where people are dead wrong.
Pitt lost at Miami by, only nine

points and Wednesday "by only '10. In ,

both games, Pitt had opportunities to
win. Everyone is giving the Pitt men’s
team respect after losing to
Connecticut Monday, ‘but the same
exact type of respect should be given
to the women. '

Pitt is no longer a pushover.
Berenato has gotten the most out of
what she has. After Wednesday’s loss
to the Hokies, Berenato said, “If you
asked me at the beginning of the sea-
son, I would never have said we would
have two conference wins. I would
have said probably none.”

Even Berenato is impressed by
‘what she has been able to accomplish
with her young team. Their record is 6-
10 (2-4 in the Big East). But the games
coming up are winnable games. Pitt
now stands 12th in the conference, and
as stated before, 12 teams make the

conferenceitournament. So as of today, 

Pitt would reach its goal of making its
own conference tournament. _ »

Saturday, Pitt will travel to St.
John’s, who is 13th in the conference.
This is a game Pitt ‘must win in order
to make the tournament, and the fol-
lowing Saturday‘ at home, Pitt will take
on West Virginia, a team it lost to ear’-
lier in the season, but had a lead late in
the second half, only to ‘see the
Mountaineers come back. This. is

Panthers will try to bounce back at the CarrierDome
     ,   -        é

  
  

    

Men’s basketball, page 9

The Orangemen are led by junior Hakim Warrick,
who averages 20 points per contest.

Sophomore guard Gerry McNamara, who
played a key role in the Orangemen’s title run last
season, hurt his groin in Tuesday’s loss to Seton
Hall. If McNamara is unable to play Saturday, the
Orangemen will look for Billy Edelin to pick up
the slack.

On the season, Edelin is averaging more than
15 points per game and leads the team in assists,
with 84. The Orangemen’s home floor inside the
Carrier Dome is known as one of the toughest
places to play in the country and marks the second
straight game that the Panthers will play in front of
a large and loud crowd.

“I think we are going to be comfortable going
down to Syracuse,” said Krauser. “UConn had a
really loud crowd, and I think playing in front of
crowds like that, we like it, and we will adjust to
it.” ‘

A year ago, the Panthers and the Orangemen
split the two-game series, with the home team win-
ning each time. The Panthers won at the Petersen’
Events Center 73-60, behind Julius Page’s 25
points and Chevon Troutman’s 23.

Less’ than two weeks later, the Orangemen won
a game for the ages at the Carrier Dome, '67-65.
With less than a second remaining and the Panthers
trailing by two, Jaron Brown lofted a pass to
Brandin Knight, who nailed a 45-footer, which,
after review, was deemed after the buzzer.

players like Brandin. Knight, Julius‘

to Pitt women’s basketball. It is

nowhere near UConn or Notre Dame

_ This team - deserves a ‘lot of
respect. They play with so much heart
and passion. No matter what the score,
they never give up. Credit Berenato

bright future for Pitt women’s basket-
ball. A 1
