  F_ormerly‘.a Missionary‘. in Java

 

_  ago we received a‘ letter from Rev. B».  Archer, Col.
‘_:”_}eVrintendent off the North. Sumatra Missionof the M. E. Church.

recounted some ‘of his interesting"

;,r1e,ncVes1 since leaving the United States. We have been trying to

distance of about 40 ‘miles. In this
ﬁeld our most‘ serious limitation is not
‘alack of open doors, but. a lack "of
funds. ‘ (Thus the decreasein" mission
receipts this year in the 1 home land,
gives us a.great_deal of-. concern.) ‘ All’
our preaching places are partly self-
‘supporting -and our plan"is to ‘make
;them.m_ore so". Wehave requests now
from new centers asking ‘us to send
them a preacher and they’ will ﬁnd a
part of his support locally if the Mis-‘
sion. could provide the bala/nc‘e, but
‘we’ have had to .tell them to wait, as
all our funds ; have been allocated.

District, A where .Mr_.‘ ;Got_ts‘chall is the’
missionary in charge.‘ x.’I‘he eastern
part of this district is ‘pretty well set
tled, but the western section is quite
‘primitive, being mostly jungle. The
people living‘. there are“-largely pagan‘
Bataka and, A. as yet, have scarcelybeen
touched by_ the blight of Islam. The
Government is new constructing a
road through: this.‘ section,..w_hich will
throw the country open to' the inﬂu-.
ences from the coast and also make it‘
_possible for the people. of the west to
movefin and develop the land. ‘ When
this country is so opened the .-;mission-
aries of Islam will make their way ‘in
.amon‘g._the natives. We are now. at-
tempting to establish ‘a line of schools
and ‘churches in this ‘section, _which
will ﬁend to cut ‘off,‘th_‘e advance of
'Moh‘a1nmedanism and enableius to win“
the‘p‘eople~ to Christ.‘ J We ‘ have‘ cc‘-
cupied three places‘ in‘this ‘region al-
ready with schools andjcliurches and
expect to open others as soon as funds,
are? available. } '_ 1 1 . ‘
Last June ‘I spent about ten days‘in-
Ashan visiting ‘our work. Three days
of that ..time"were‘ spent in the jungle,

Gottschall ‘and. I_ travelled ‘by motor-_
cycle to the ‘end"of theiroad at“a place
called. SVI-Ioetapadang. _ “There “We se-
cured ‘two; nativeboys to ‘help’ carry

‘two. hours after. dark, »having’,_..been‘_ de-

We were drenched, as it. had“ been

some ‘of the streams and, at times.

Trying to make one’s way» through a

is bad enough, but/to”go ‘througVh._bY~
"night is not exactly a pleasure trip. ‘
The.‘ only light we had was from small
can‘dl_es',’ which the rain Vlcolntinually
extinguished. However, we ﬁnally Val‘-'
r.ived“at the.‘ school “ and rwere‘ kindly
received b.y‘the‘native‘teacher. and the
