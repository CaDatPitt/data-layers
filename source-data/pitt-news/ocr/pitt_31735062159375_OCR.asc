TUESDAY, NOVEMB ER 22, 1949!

Little Bimbo Cecconi twists away for a long gain on a punt return in Saturday’s game.

Goalposts F all to Fans  
A fterPanther Victory

The Pitt front was quiet on Saturday following the 10-0 conquest of
Penn State. Although a predominately high school crowd»managed to tear
down both Stadium goal posts, enthusiasm for the win quickly waned.

 

Cops Probe

  JugAf f air

Oakland police and the parents
of Marjorie iloman were searching
today for witnesses to the throwing
of a wine bottle in the student sec-
tion of Pitt Stadium during Satur-
day’s football game. E

The half-gallon jug struck the
Pitt coed on the head and shattered,
inflicting a severe scalp wound-
Friends from PiKA fraternity carried
the injured girl to nearby Presby-
terian Hospital, then pointed out

MARJORIE HOMAN'
Gene Selling, a phys ed junior, as
the thrower of the bottle.

Spectators sitting near Seiling
confirmed the identification at the
game, but as yet have failed to re-
port to police to positively identify
the man at a hearing. He was re-
leased Sunday on a $2500 bond
pending l»-larjorie’s release from the
hospital, where she is making a
quick recovery.

The popular Tri-Delt sophomore
was sitting some twenty rows from
Seiling’s seat when the bottle struck
her. Although several hundred stu-
dents saw the jug shatter on‘ her
head, only a few claimed to have
seen it thrown. None of these ap-
peared at No. 4 Police Station

Marjorie’s parents, Mr. and Mrs.

- Paul J. Homan' of 518 Tingley Ave.,
Bellevue, are trying to locate the

' witnesses before i,Seivling’s hearing.

Five sororities and one fraternity
held post—game open houses. In
the evening over 350 couple s
crowded into the Schenley Hotel
for the Grand Finale dance. ‘Chair-
man Marie Homisak estimated that
about 50% of those attending were
from Penn State.

During the fifth hour Friday Pitt
rooters turned out in the Soldiers
and Sailors Memorial to pay tribute
to the nineteen graduating seniors
on the football team.

Woody Wolf, Panther broadcaster,
emceed the rally. During his ac-
colade of everything Pitt, Wolf
pinned another verbal medal on the
Varsity lelarching Band.

As the band stormed on stage
he mused, “As usual the band’s in
good shape. They haven’t lost a
foo“‘lball game sinceI’ve been broad-
casting these last eleven years.”

He rambled on to pay tribute to
"thekidswho fouryears ago started
the battle to take Pitt to the

heights.” Called to the mike, Guard 

Bernie Barkouskie summed up the
general feelings of the nineteen
seniors with his brief "1 really
enjoyed playing here -at Pitt.l wish
I had four more years to go.’,’

Wolf himself led a final cheer
for the gridders to close the rally.

Congress Backs
Two Dances for  

Commons

Student Congressgyesterday climbedfrom beneath a maze of

parliamentary procedure to come out in favor of a senior dance
next spring and a Christmas dance next year in the Commons Room

of the Cathedral.

To Dick Kovar’s original motion that Congress favor a Com- ;
mons Room dance next,Christmas was added the amendment that
a senior dance also be planned for this coming spring.

Kovar originally introduced the motion to Congress two weeks
ago, intending to hold the dance next month.

He based his reversal on the fact that the dance would con-
flict with the school calendar and that approval for the measure
would be requiredfrom the Board of Trustees and the University

administration.

He explained that permission to
use the Commons Room for a formal
dance must come not only from the
deans of men. and women and the
Chancellor, but primarily from the
Board of Trustees.

After asking Congress to drop
any idea“ of holding a Commons
Room dance this year, Kovar pro-
posed that a committee be formed
to work on the idea for next Christ-
mas from now to June. He said that
the atmosphere of the room with its
blazing Yuleilogs lends itself to
an occasion of this kind.

Dave Fox added that the cost of
decorations for such a dance would
be at a minimum, since evergreen
trees and boughs are already in
place at Christmas.

An amendmentto Kovar’s motion
to have the "juniors sponsor a
senior dance” was defeated.

Flora Diemert, Congress presi-
dentfpointed outrhat many dances
fail because "too large of a group
is catered to, rather than just a
small group” such as the senior
class.

That the senior women’s class
is definitely making plans for a
graduation dance on Commencement
Day and is considering holding it
in the Commons Room was brought
out by Betty Bolger, president of
WSGA and representative to Con-
gress.

Kovar, again taking the floor,
pointed out that, as the motion
reads, thatCongress "favor” and
not "sponsor” the dance, it is of
little importance who sponsors it.

The motion passed favoring a
graduation dance this spring and a
Christmas dance next year _in the
Commons Room.

Kovar was named chairman of the
committee which Congress hopes
will eventually secure permission
to hold the dance in the Commons
Room. ‘

Answers to a poll on the ques-
tion of football subsidization were
tabulated by Campus Opinion, a
student poll run by the Pitt News.

Seventy-two per cent of students
favored subsidization of players
and 28 per centwere against it.

"Do you believe athletes should
be paid outright salaries?" was the
second question on the list. Again
the students answered yes this
time by a ratio of two-to-one.

A fo rtunate M isca nriage

Student Congress was talking last week about benefits, con-

5 tests,'and so on, to help the Pitt

Chest Fund reach its goal, some-

thing it didn’t come close to accomplishing in its recent school

 - wide drive. This is a rather sad reflection on the entire Pitt
  family.

The drive missed its target by some $2400, or roughly 25 per

cent. This marked the first time

since the scheme’s venture sev-

'eral semesters ago that the drive has fallen short.
While a failure to meet the requests of charity shouldn’t be

why the Chest wasn’t filled to

- alibied off,it is nevertheless, easy now to look back and surmise

the brim. The clustering of the

/I many charities into a single campaign was the basic motivation
 for the inauguration of the Chest system. It seemed to serve the
 Diurpose well when conducted once a semester. But this year the

committee was forced, by university ruling, to shoot the works with
just one drive spanning the entire school year.
’ Apparently, that carried a good thing a little too far. For, with

’ only one crack instead of two, the committee naturally had to

jump its goal. And it was jumped out of reach. As expected, many
students had a wary eye'on the rocky economic picture when the
Chest envelopes were passed around. A

I But, with all this, you can’t get away from the results of a
little mathematics. The goal -- $8600. Approximate student body

included in drive --

t amount, need have come from only 25 per cent of the students,

the same figure, percentage-wi se, of which the drive miscarried.

Underaheadline “Panthers Don't ,

There is good coffee in the Cathedral. A blend that is served
at the Faculty Club is reported to have a very fine flavor and
succulent goodness. This coffee, by the way, is one of the brands
Viiss Cramblet deriounced as not pleasing to the student palates.

The same agent who contributed the above fact also said that

at the dinner where he tasted the
FC Brew, the general opinion seem-
ed to be that the TS coffee was no
good. However, no one would be
quoted.

We’re still waiting for that taste
test that We were promised by Miss
Cramblet. We're also still waiting
to find a ham sandwich from that
charming lady's domain that con-
tains some ham that can be seen;
Just as a test we forked out two
bits the other day and what did we
get--an edging of fat, a little bit of
ham, and a grease spot where the
bread had soaked most of the meat
up.

They called it home-baked ham,
but they don't say what home it's
baked in. The only pig that has a
ham small enough to cut one of the
Tuck Shop slices from is a guinea

Just remember, dear hearts and
gentle students, that every item in
the Tuck Shops must carry itself,
and if they have to gag you with
that special blend of coffee for
eight cents (Miss C. claims this
barely pays for the sugar and
cream) or starve you with their hot
d’ouerve sized meat on regular size
bread, each item will do just that.

But we mustn’t go on like this.
The Misses Cramblet and Skewis
know what’s best for students and
have only their interests at heart.

The Rummy Reviewer

There was nothing very new
about the Cold Turkey issue of the
Panther. The fact of the matter is
that if the Panther staff had no ex-
change magazines, there would
have been no Panther. Much of the
humor (?) was from other publica-
tions. This is O.K. but you have to
draw the line somewhere, and the

boys seem to have forgotten to.

About the best section in the

book was the Campus Candids. Even
that contained some pretty low
ones. Afteriall, the staff should
have some respect. We eagerly
await the next issue, which the
magazine boys are now working on
behind locked doors (to keep com-
plainants out).-

Penalty of Fame

We pause briefly in this epistle
to beat the long roll as we ponder
the fate of one News managing edi-
tor. He read the story of the Delta
Tau Delta fraternity brother (he’s
one, too) and campus newspaper
managing editor who met--shall we
say-an untimely end.

This News managing ed was
last seen sulking behind one of the
columns in the Commons Room,
trying to think up a way to ease
the minds of the outraged puritans
whose toes he has trod on in his
Commons Room Dance campaign.
He can’t afford to make enemies,
you know.

Just the same, we have a com-
plete obituary typed up, so if any-
thing does happen, we can scoop
the IF-Etin.

Time Out

It behooves us to say something
about the football team. Maybe
they didn’t win ’em all, like Doc
Carlson’s basketballers are going
to do, but personally we have never
seen a team with more heart and
more downright refusal to quit.

Parting Thought

We leave you with this parting
thought for Thanksgiving: If you
have nothing else to be thankful
for at least be thankful that you
don’t have to drink Tuck Shop (ugh)
coffee for four whole days ina row.

pointed out that the only two inde-
pendents, Lou Cecconi (who re-
signed be ore the election rumpus

 was ever known) and Bob McKowen,
‘ were members of the unconstitution-

ally elected group.
“Was IF waiting until the Inde-

 pendents had died as a political,
"organization before they called for
‘ a re-election?” he wanted to know.

It was his view that IF was Wait-
l'ng for the moment when they could

i unseat the two independents and
«refill their positions with frat men.

Ray Maher is president of IF

‘-Council.

There has also been talk of a

trol of Congress. ;

letter to the board of_deans express-
ing disapproval of the one-hour
victory rallies, or if it has been
split because the group supposedly
led by Maher is after the guiding
reins in Congress is an unaswer—
able question now.

Those who believe that the split
has been caused by the second of
these reasons also have no kind
words for Maher.

To their way of thinking, Maher,
when he first discovered the in-
validityof the elections last sum-
mer, didn’t think it through far
enough. That is, Maher felt that all
of Congress would be out and/or
the officers would be out too.

As it was, only five Congress
members were considered uncon-
stitutionally elected and parlia-
mentarian authority placed the
choice of a re—election and the re-
election entirely in the hands of
Student Congress.

Expounding the theoryof Haher’s
opponents even further, they felt
that Maher was waiting for the op-
portune moment to release his in-
formation’ and then take over

The "opportune moment” seemed
to be when Maher and his "group”
had been publicized over their plan
to protest to the board of deansthat
one hour for a victory rally was not
enough.

In actuality both these reasons
seem ridiculous. IF holds such a
predominance in Congress that two
independents could offer no effect-
ive competition. T

Also Congress, while split on
some issues, agrees on more.

Maher graduates this June. If
he weren’t and should run for an-
other office this Spring,it would be
interesting to note what effect
these stories would have upon his
chances.

The Pitt students demonstrated
their ignorance to forty odd thou-
sand spectators when they cheered
because Bill Bye, a member of op-
posing team, was injured. They
actually cheered to see a man hurt
on the playing field. Just how ill-
mannered, how barbaric, can agroup
of supposedly intelligent students
become? ‘

We could take a lesson in foot-
ball etiquette from the Penn stu-
dents. When Jimmy Joe Robinson
was helped from the playing field,
‘the Penn cheering section went all
out to show their appreciation for
a fine football player. ‘

Our trouble is just a matter of
timing. Why not cheer as the player
leaves the field, not when he is
injured. Why not practice the com-
’mon decency, the good manners,
that is inherent in all of us.

We have the enthusiasm,
show it at the proper time.

The campus seems to be bubbling
over with comments about the Tuck
Shop coffee; but as yet I haven’t
heard any remarks about the bad-
tasting water that one drinks out
of the fountains throughout the
cathedral.

I sit through a very dry history

lets

class, and history can get dry,

day just waiting to get to a water
fountain to relax my arid throat.
Class finally ends and I rush out
to the fountain hoping to soothe
the dry feeling that I developed in
history class. Hopefully I wait
my turn in line for water, but as I
waitl become thoroughly discouraged
at the grim looks on the faces of
those drinking. My turn comes. But
in view of the previous wrought
faces I realize that there must be
something drastically wrong "with
the H O and anxiety leaves me. I
no longer am as enthused as I had
been about getting a drink. llaving
nothing to lose I turned the handle
and to my amazement I not only
gota warm bath -- without atowel --
but I tasted something that pro-
bably could be used for an experi-
ment in a chemical lab. One could
hardly classify the potent liquid

, as water. That stuff simply is not

fit to drink. -

It seems that the water tastes
more like Tuck Shop coffee and
that’s paying no compliment in
either case. I doubt if there is a
place in the cathedral where one
can get a nice, cool, refreshing,
drink of water. As yet, I haven’t
found one. If anyone knows of such
a place would they please run an
ad — in the Pitt News.

Triple Musical Treat

 The Winter Wonderland, IF’s main ball, Dec. _9, at the William
Penn Hotel, features a triple attraction in the music line. Three

big name bands have been signed up for the dance.
Johnny Long and his Orchestra, already famous in Pittsburgh
fortheir engagements at the Stanley Theatre and at Carnegie Tech,

During the successful five hour
program at the Chancellor’s Recep-
tion Friday evening, parents ‘of
this fall's freshmen received an
opportunity to learn just what col-
ledge life at Pitt means to their
sons and daughters.

The program for the 29th annual
Reception was divided into three
parts; a speaking and musical pro-
gram in the Commons Room early
in the evening, guided tours of the
Cathedral, including visits to the
Fine Arts department, the University
library, the Nationality Rooms and
other classrooms on the first three
floors, and the Blue Tuck ‘Shop;
and the Chancellor’s and Deans’
reception line in the Commons
Room, followed by refreshments.

Speakers for the beginning pro-
gram were Chancellor Rufus H.
Fitzgerald, Miss Helen P. Rush,
dean of women, Theodore W. Biddle,
dean of men, and the deans of the
undergraduate schools. Musical
selections by Mary Emma Hirsch
and Thompson Lieper, students in
the College, introduced the parents
to the Pitt Medley. Frederic Lotz’;
university organist, provided the
intorductory organ music.

While the Men’s Glee Club sang
their arrangements under the direc-
tion of Colin C. Sterne, the parents
were divided into three groups for
tours, some going to the seventh
to visit the libraries, then walking
down until they reached the Blue
Tuck Shop. Another group went
around the Commons Room to see
the Nationality Rooms while the
third group met the Chancellor

The three hundred students who
acted as aides for ghe evening re-
presented honorary organizations
on campus, SCIIIOI IHCDCOIS, upper-
class counselors, and other student
leaders.

“Caste,” the Players’ second production of the season, is a

unique one in many ways.

The most popular of T.W. Robertson’s plays, when first pro-

duced in 1867, marked the beginning of modern realism" in the
theater. It also began the idea of road companies. A 
In one of the first performances of “Caste,” a practical joker .

stole the wig which George D’Alray
was supposed to wear. Because of
the wig, the actor who played the
part of George had shaved his head.
In one of his entrances, George
wore a hat which was made to fit
the wig. The hat, without the wig
or hair, came down over George's
eyes. Two of the other characters

‘ who were on the stage at the same

time almost broke the scene by
laughing.

The play, which will be produced
Dec. 15, 16, and 17,‘is theistory of
two young ballet dancers and their
troubles with the more socially-con-

scious members of the C35?-_
Bill Bode, associate director,

has stated that the play could easily
turn into an old fashioned meld’-
drama. The Players, however,’ will
attempt to present the comedy so
as to convey the same purpose that
the author wished to convey when
he wrote it. , A

"Caste” is described by Harvey T
J. Pope, director, as a romantic
comedy of manners and morals. It~V
will serve to acquaint Pitt»..stud.~. nts /
with period setting and acting.

Tickets will be available at the
Student Desk for $1.

CHINELSE T

A chemist by trade,Dr. Murphy spoke to a crowd of about 250
students last Thursday morning in Stephen Foster Memorial on,

“Opportunities for Careers in Tech-
nical Journalism.” He was intro-
duced by Dr. Robert R. McGregor,
head of the Pittsburgh branch of
the American Chemical Society. The
ACS student affiliate group spon-
sored the talk.

Dr. Murphy believed that science
students with high English ratings
have many opportunitiesfor careers
in technical journalism.

In his speech, he said, "The ex-
plosion of the atomic bomb brought
home the impact of the physical
sciences onthe social sciences to-
day...there is a great demand for
technically-trained people in tech-
nical journalism --trade magazines,
house organs, and particularly the
industrial advertising field.”

Since 1942 Dr. Murphy has been
director of the news service of the
ACS and editor of three of the fore-
most chemical journals in the U.S:
“Industrial and Engineering Chem-

istry,” "Chemical and Engineering
News,” and "Analytical Chemis-
try.”

"Lagoon of Decision” is a diary

form, eyewitness story he wrote

about the Bikini atom bomb. Of the
atomic explosion he says simply,
"It staggered the imagination.”

The beer signs? The purpose of
that research on rare gases, prin-
cipally neon, was a development of
railroad warning signals. Ne on light-
ing was proposed because of its
fog-penetrating quality. The beer
signs and the widespread modern
use of neon advertising came about
indirectly.

Improved Sight Skills

By 3103 THOMAS

There are some people in this world who can glance at a num-
ber like 937495026 for one three-millionth of a second and see
right away that it IS 937495026 and NOT 937495027.

Finding and improving such skills in a person is a sideline of
one of the lesser known branches of the University, the Reading

Laboratory on the
floor of the Cathedral.

For the better part of 10 years
the staff of the reading laboratory
has been aiding the people ofPitts-
burgh to improve their reading
speed and comprehension. Under
the guise of courses marked
“General Education 122,” the
lab holds Tuesday evening classes
in reading improvement as well as
two classes MWF mornings.

The classes are billed as "im-
proving comprehension, speed,
and vocabulary” in reading. Two
credits are given forone semester’ s
work. ,

Dr. G. A. Yoakam, head of the
education department, is in nom-
inal charge of the- reading lab. Dr.
H. B. Knipp, however, has im-
mediate supervision over its acti-
vities. Laboratory instructors are
David L. Clelland and Josephine
Tronsberg.

During the spring semester last
year, Clelland conducted a read-
ing experiment in conjunction with
the writing of his doctor’s thesis.
In it l85’freshmen and sophomores
were subjected to a battery of
reading tests covering all phases
of reading and seeing skill.

Following the tests the volun-
teers were tried on four varieties
of training methods to improve
speed and comprehension of read-
ing. The results have not yet been
announced, but students who aided

twenty-sixth

‘in the experiment have reported im-

mediate results in faster reading
and better‘vision.

During a given year the staff of
the Reading Lab gives reading aid
to about 175 Pittsburgh school
children, according to Dr. Knipp.

General education 122 trains
evening school and regular ses-
sion students.

Chem E Profs
Read Papers

Dr. Kuo-tsung Yu and Dr. James
Coull, of the University's Chemical
Engineering department, will pre-
‘sent papers for discussion at an
engineers convention scheduled for
Pittsburgh.

The American Institute of Chem-
ical Engineers will sponsor its for-
ty-second annual meeting at the
William Penn Hotel, December 4
through 7. we I

Among the technical papers cov-
ering subjects of general interest
to engineers which have been in-
cluded in the program will be a
special series covering Atomic En-
ergy, Phase Equilibria, Disposal
of Industrial Wastes, and the In-
dustrial Training of Young Engi-
neers.

The choice of Pittsburgh as the
site of the national meeting pro-
vides an opportunity for the nation's
chemicalengineers to inspect many
of the industrial plants and acquire
first-hand knowledge of the varied
industrial operation for which Wes-
tern Pennsylvania is World-famous.

Pitt’s sedate ground game added
a few frills on Saturday and the Pan-
tliers romped over Penn State, 19-0,
in the season’s finale for both
teams.

Though Mike Milligan said after
the game that nothing new had been
added to the Pitt attack, the- man-
in—motion and lateral pass never
showed to better advantage than
it did against the Lions.

Lou Cecconi got the first Jungle
Cat drive underway when he inter-
cepted a State pass on his own
five and returned it to the 21. He
then passed to Armand DiFonso
who was in motion for a first down
on the State 46.

A first down advanced the ball
to the Lion’s 35, and then Carl
DePasqua sliced through center
and lateraled to Cecconi on the
27 who ran for a touchdown with
four minutesleft in the first quarter.

Though Pitt threatened several
times after that, it wasn’t until
late in the third quarter that the
Panthers scored again.

Depasqua set up the TD by fak-
ing a deep reverse to Paul Chess
and then passing to Chess along
the sidelines. The Pitt wingback
sped to the Penn State 8 for a gain
of 5'7 yards.

Cecconi on the next play, be-
hind fine blocking, ran for the score.

Four Panther
Await Word from Pros

After figuring prominently in
Pitt’s 19-0 victory over Penn State,
jimmie ‘Joe Robinson, Bimbo Cec-
coni, Bob‘ Plotz, and Bernie Bar-
kouskie are awaiting further word
from Philadelphia about playing
professional ball for the Eagles
following graduation.

They have not been officially
drafted by the Eagles as erroneous-
ly reported in Friday's Pitt News.

Received Queries

I-Iowever,each of the four players
has been the recipient of a letter
indicatingthat the Eagles are inter-
ested in knowing their future foot-
ball plans.

Bob Plotz said, "They wrote
that our names are on a list, but
there's nothing certain about being
drafted."

Bimbo Cecconi added,» “The
letters are just ‘feelers’ to letius
know that we have been considered
by the Eagles as draft choices.”

Won’t Plague State

Although the draft status of the
four is uncertain, one thing is cer-
tain. Being seniors, this quartet
of Panthers won*t be around next
year to plague Joe Bedenk and his
Lions when they come to the Stad-
ium.

In the dressing (room, Bedenk
singled out Cecconi as "the dif-
ference” between Pitt and State.
He said, “With the exception of
Cecconi, the teams were evenly
matched. He made the big difference
between the two clubs when it
came to offense." .

Rogel Praises Pitt

State’s offense was hampered
somewhat when Fran Rogel was
injured midway in the second quar-
ter. Rogel, who dented the Blue
and Gold line for substantial gains
early in the game, said that Pitt’s
forward wall was as strong as in
the past.

Lefthanded passer Owen Dough-
erty, who had a poor day hitting

Grid Stars

receivers, said that the Pitt line
never gave him a chance to get
set to throw.

Quatse Befuddled

All of this explains why Dr.
Jesse Quatse found it hard to pick
the outstanding lineman of the day.
When asked, Quatse raised his
arms in an all-embracing gesture
and said, "They were all outstand-
ing.”

The one State player who was
singled out by the Panthers for
his play in the game was Chuck
Drazenovich, Lion Quarterback.
Nick Bolkovac said, “He's the
best blocking back I've been hit
by all year."

Mounties Tell
B ill Reynolds

He Has Packard

Bill Reynolds has been "given"
a Packard convertible by the Daily
Athenaeum, West ‘Virginia student
newspaper.

Perhaps a bit irked that Reynolds,
a topflight West Virginia high school

ball player should go toPitt, McClure.

wrote:

"Pitt overwrought--about a maga-
zine article claiming they gave
Bill Reynolds a Packard conver-
tible for sentimental reasms.”

Sentimental reasons or not, Bill
is still using his shoe leather to
go to football practice. The con-
vertible is news to him.

Frosh Meet
J V’s Today

The Pittfrosh, fielding their first
intercollegiate football team since
1938, ended their four-game season
last Friday by bowing to a hepped-
up West Virginia freshman team,
14-7. '

This loss gave ‘the Panther first-
year men a record of two wins and
two losses. They will have another
chance, however, to better that
mark unofficially when they meet
the junior varsity at the Stadium at
3 p.'m. today.

The Panthers lost their finale in
a bitter cold at Mountaineer Stadium
before a crowd oﬁiaabout 800 fans.

A long injury ist weakened the
Pitt team. Frank Guadagnino, hard-
driving fullback who has scored in
every frosh tilt, was only able to
play one set of downs.

Eugene Dolfi, regular tackle, and
Joe Schmidt, quarterback, did not
make the trip. At least three other
frosh played the game with bad

fact that Radnor had just driven
‘the big fella practically into the

3 Nomellini plenty of trouble all after-
’ noon.
I He had the jump on Nomellini

It seems that everybody agrees

   that Nomellini did not play an out-

standing game and on defense he
plays head-on with the center, if
that means anything. I do not know
Len Radnor personally but I just
like to see the guy get a little cre-
dit when he certainly deserves it.

boys and downtown reporters,but
there are ways for us to compen-
sate, at least partially, for that
shortcoming. For example, Pitt
News football writers spend long
afternoons throughout the fall at-
tending grid practice sessions.
Downtown writers, under pressure
of more torrid deadlines, cannot do
so.

Since we are not able to spot at
a glance a good Pitt team from a
poor Pitt team, we look hard and
long and then form whatever con-
clusions appear to be safe.

_ Stop Around

Now then, Harry, as to your mus-
ing over whether we ever “watch
line play at all,” I should like to
assure you that we occasionally
give it a glance. In fact, we even
know the shape and color of a foot-
ball. ’

However, we are not quite sure
what people mean when they talk
about “single wing.” Would you
mind stopping by the office some-
time and explaining it to us?

Pitt then waited until the final
minute to give the crowd of 44,571
its biggest thrill of the day.

Bimbo faded back from his own
41 and looped a longpass to Jimmy
]oe'Robinson on the State 25. Rob-
inson caught the ball behind the
Lion’s secondary, juggled it for
‘the next ten yards, and then legged
it into the end zone.

Nick Bolkovac’s conversion after
the second touchdown rounded out
the scoring.

Penn State threatened to score
only once in_the ball game. It drove
to the Panther S in thefinal period,
but Cecconi intercepted a Bill
Luther pass behind the goal line for
a touchback.

In fact, any chance that the lion’s
held’ for an upset was lost when
Fran Rogel was forced to leave
the game because of a leg injury
in the second quarter.

-- By DAVE POLLOCK

 

gnashing of teeth had subsided
after Saturday’s grid games, it was
revealed that Will Doerge had bested
his fellow yogis in the battle of
wits (of one kind or another.)

Humbly brushing off all acknowl-
edgements of his superior forseeing
ability, Wallopin’ Will was heard to
remark, "I owe it all to inside
dopeﬂ’

The other yogis had to agree.
They’ve been saying all season
that Doerge seemed to be doped
inside. He was graciously crowned
by his fellow yogis in a gay cere-
mony, the Frustrated Four showing
no signs of bitterness. They had
been wanting to crown him all year.

That they gave him a loaded
cigar and a crown lined with glue
should not be taken as any indi-
cation that their admiration for his
achievement was not genuine.

Sir John Megella, dean of the
sports staff,had no regrets on being
bested by one game for the yogi

comment, however, and was last
seen admiring the view from the
Coroapolis bridge.

The crusading sports editor, M.
Sidney Kopleman, who was defend-
ing his yogi crown, could not be
reconciled to the fact that he fin-
ished third. He and Laughing Boy
Stan Skirboll, who edged Dave Pol-
lock (the yogi brother we don’t
talk about) for fourth place, were
seen drowning ﬁieir sorrows in
Hindustan hootch.

Pollock was nonchalant through
it all, probably because he had

In Hands of Independent Loop

Paradoxically enough, a fraternity
has helped the independents win
out over the fraternities again in
IM football. ~

Psi Omega, a dental frat which
won the title in the Independent

ALeague,downed PiKA, the IF cham-

pion, last Friday, 19-6, to keep the
All-Campus crown in the hands of
the Independent League.

The victors, outplayed by PiKA
in the early moments, had to come
back with two touchdowns in the
second half to win. This was ach-
ieved primarily through the sharp
passing of Joe Stewart who found
the unfavorable weather conditions
quite to his liking.

PiKA broke the ice in the first
quarter when Ronny Livingston
tossed 35 yards to Marty Kohr in
the Psi Omega end zone. However,
that was the only score for the fra-
ternity champs as the Psi O’s pulled

down the curtain on their opponents’

scoring. From there cn in the accur-
ate arm of Stewart filled the air
with deadly passes that accounted
for the three PsiOmega touchdowns.
