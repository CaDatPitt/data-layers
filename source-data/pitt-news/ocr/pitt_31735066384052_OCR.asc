The Dithridge Street fraternities,
of which there are four, are located
along one side of a tree-lined street
in a middle-class neighborhood of
apartment-dwellers and
established, home-owning
residents. Despite the clash of
lifestyles, Dithridge Street Greeks
appear to enjoy fairly amicable
relations with neighbors.

The Dithridge Street fraternity
closest to campus is Pi Lambda Phi,

well-represented by both its recent

owth and its omnipresent spokes-

 man, ﬁfth-year brother Ezra Krieg.

Pi Lambda Phi has accomplished
aturnaround for the better since the
early 1970’s when Pitt fraternities
were on the decline and the Pi Lams
were leading the way. This year’s
pledge class of 23 is the largest in
Pitt’s Greek system, and those who
join the 27 current brothers will
become part of one of Pitt’s most
visible and active houses.

Krieg, a past president of Pi
Lambda Phi, came to Pitt from
Massachusetts as a “country boy”
and said the move was somewhat
depressing. “I needed something
more than what the Towers had to
ffer, ” Krieg said. “I needed some
rivacy, something bigger, possibly

“Star Wars”.

   
 

some greenery. What I needed was
ahome. Pi Lambda Phi offered me a
home; they understood my needs,
and they gave me a chance to get
away.”

Pi Lams say they place an
emphasis on academics, though
they ﬁnd time to have frequent
times together, whether at a “little
sister” dinner or a house party,
which usually takes place weekly.

The Pi Lams also are interested in
intramurals—everyone who
practices gets a chance to play—and
they assist neighbors by shoveling
snow, policing littered sidewalks
and working for an annual food
drive.

Pi Lambda Phi moved to its
current address in 1916. Sixteen
members live at the house, which is
usually relatively clean. The
basement is paneled and features a
large dance area and a bar. A
pinball machine, washer and dryer
also occupy a part of the basement.

The ﬁrst floor has a pool room and
a large living room. An adequate
kitchen faces a spacious parking lot.

Pi Lambda Phi’s pledge fee is
$120; rent and dues are $80 monthly
and non-residents pay $150 yearly.

Phi Delta Theta, a handful of
houses from Pi Lambda Phi, boasts
of its “no-hazing” policy. “We

LSC—A Boost

ByJ0HNWANCHAN LSC last year received an Exxon

grant to implement a training
program that combines study skill
techniques with peer counseling.

This is the philosophy of the
successful Learning Skills Center
(LSC), a division of the University
Counseling and Placement Service.
The recently expanded LSC pro-
vides free services to all University
students and employees to help
them master effective learning
techniques as well as improve
academic preformance.

Located on the ﬁfth ﬂoor of the
 dent Union, LSC is under the
gidance of Dr. Susan Schiller,
coordinator, and Georgine Mater-
niak, assistant coordinator. There
also is a trained staff that includes a
reading specialist, an athletic
academic counselor and student
academic counselors (SACs), who
are trained in peer counseling.

  

“We have always believed that
peer counselors can be very
effective models of appropriate and
effective learning techniques and
attitudes,” said Schiller. “There-
fore, student to student counseling

actualizing our philosophy.”

The 18 SACs are given 20 hours of
training in study skill techniques.

“I believe the SACs are effective
because peers can relate to the
common problems that students
experience with studying," Said
Materniak. “They have ‘the
advantage of knowing appropriate

methods that can result in -increased
understanding and retention, more

were formed from a local fraternity
on the basis that we would have no
hazing,” vice president Gary Foster
said.

The currently chartered Phi Delta
Theta has been on campus less than
a decade. The original Phi Delts lost
their charter here in the early
1960’s, and the current fraternity
was formed from a small fraternity
after a nine-year absence.

Phi Delta Theta has one of the
strongest national fraternities, and
the local afﬁliate has

grown

considerably since the Phi Delts
returned to Pitt. There are 30
members, 20 of whom live at the
house, and 10 pledges this term.
The Phi Delts are active in
intramurals, community service
and even commuter service——the
“commuter bandit” is a Phi Delt

are planned.

The initiation fee at Phi Delta

and per person rent $300 each term.

Next door to Phi Delta Theta is
Alpha Epsilon Pi, whose house is
not adorned by fraternity letters
because of a housing ordinance.

AEP is not a large fraternity, nor
is it a well-established one. But is it
trying to make a go of it at Pitt.

Ripping Off- Run The Risks

By PATTY TASCARELLA
Pin News Staff Writer

How much can be lifted from the
Towers cafeteria without detection
by the checkers, and what happens
to someone if they get caught?

Certainly, almost everyone can
cite tales of people packing gym
bags, suitcases and even bowling
ball cases full of cafeteria surplus
and escaping undetected. while
other people have gone before the
Judicial Board for sneaking a bagel.
Those unfortunates are rumored to
have been ordered to work it off in
the cafeteria as checkers, who have
to catch other cafeteria thieves.

Checkers have the authority to
stop someone leaving the cafeteria
only if the person is carrying food
out in the open. They can ask the
suspect to empty out or open
handbags and other apparatus but
cannot force him to do so. Cafeteria
staff workers also have the authority
to question a student if they catch
him hiding something away for
later, or to tip off the checkers to do
so.
To test the effectiveness of the
cafeteria security, a Pitt News
renorter made arrangements with

cafeteria manager Ted Kokladis to
intentionally be caught stealing, or
at least give the staff every
opportunity to retrieve the stolen
goods by carrying the item in full
view of staff, students, and
checkers.

The heist included a quart jar,
ﬁlled with milk from the cafeteria’s
dispensers (there was no move to
conceal the container in a ﬁve-

minute trek between milk machine
and a table), a breadstick protrud-
ing from a pocket, half-a-dozen
cookies nestled in the hood of a ski
jacket, a handbag filled with sugar
and Sanka packets, two bagels and a
salt and pepper shaker set.

Following the agreement with

Kokladis, the reporter held a hoagie
when leaving the cafeteria.

 Lizzy’

Trying To Change Image  

By M. PATRICK MONAHAN
and  McCALL
Pitt News Staff Writer,-s
Thin Lizzy “spread the word”
Tuesday night, before a small but
enthusiastic crowd at the Stanley
Theater, that “the boys were, back
in town.”

Thin Lizzy, a band that consists
of two lrishmen from Dublin, a
Scotsman from Glascow and an
American from Los Angeles,
played a tough and aggressive
brand of rock ’n’ roll, which
meshed perfectly with their rough,
yet romantic attitude toward music.

The small crowd was a deﬁnite
surprise. The band has had several
popular selling albums, “Jail-
break,” “Johnny the Fox” and
their newest, “Bad Reputation,” to
their credit.

After the concert, Thin Lizzy’s
leader, vocalist and bassist Phil
Lynott, a striking Irishman with
thick black hair and a devilish grin,
said “the band would rather have a
small crowd that was with them,
rather than a large one that just
comes and sits on their hands”
throughout the show.

“We’re a loud and aggressive
band, primarily,” Lynott said,
“but as far as slipping in a ballad
now and then, we’re deﬁnitely
capable of that.”

What makes one think Thin Lizzy
barely has scratched the surface of
their potential is the way they work
a crowd into a festive spirit through

driving rock, ﬁlled with lyrical
1 _ imagery and intelligent themes.

This is something, most so-called
“punk rock hands,” a category
Lizzy is so often placed into, can’t
even come near.

The mistake in classiﬁcation is
not totally unexplainable; Thin
Lizzy is a cocky band onstage.

Led by the lithe Lynott, the band
seems like one happy band of
mates, letting the music rip
through the hall to release their
own primal frustrations, along with
the audience's.

Lynott leading the mayhem from
center stage, ﬂanked by the band’s
two gritty lead guitarists, 20-year-
old Brian Robertson from Glascow
and Sctoo Gorham, the tall
American with the ﬂowing waist-
length hair. Drummer Brian
Downey, a polite Irishman, is
the anchor of the band with his
timely beat-keeping terse but ﬁery
solos.

The performance was a rock ’n’
roll gang, with their songs of the
street life of young people and
interesting, ancient celtic ballads of
war and love.

Thin Lizzy opened hot and heavy
with “Soldier of Fortune,” and
kept the steam on with versions of
“Jailbreak” and “Johnny.”

Other highlights of this impres-
sive hard rock arsenal was their
AM hit of 1976, the autobiographi-
cal “The Boys are Back in Town,”
“Massacre,” “Opium Trail” and
“E-merald. ”

On the quieter side were “I’m
Still in Love With You,” “Dancin’
in the Moonlight,” a snappy song
with Van Morrisonish vocals from
Lynott, and “Don’t Believe a
Word,” a song that made it to the
English Top Ten.

Lynott made it clear that the
band has had trouble reaching the
level of popularity in the United
States that they have in England.

“For a band with seven albums
to our credit, we just haven’t
toured America enough to build up
the following who would know us as
a touring and exciting band
onstage,” Lynott said. “This is
something we deﬁnitely want to
portray as the heart of Thin Lizzy,
as we have done in England.

“What’s prevented us from
doing it was personal problems

such as me catching hepatitis from ,

too much high living; Brian getting
his hand severed in a barroom ﬁght
in London and other misfortunes
we’ve encountered in the last few
years.”

sive, buy Lynott also said the

, Poetry Readings Held

By MARTHA H. GARVEY

Last night, poetry came alive.
Michael Waters, a poet from Ohio,
gave a reading in Room 501 of the
Cathedral.

Waters began a series of readings
that will, according to English
professor Ed Ochester, “take
poetry out of the anthology and
bring it alive.” Ochester, with
professors Paul Zimmer of the
English department and Anthony
Petrosky of the School of Education,
has invited younger (under 40)
poets to come and read. Other poets
scheduled are Carol Muske (Nov. 3)
and Siv Cedring Fox (in January).

Ochester described the series as
“very various.” He said all the

poets will come from either the
Midwest or the Northeast because
“we couldn’t afford a very large
travel allowance.”

The money for the series has also
come from various sources. The
series is being sponsored by the
English department, the School of
Education, the College of Arts and
Sciences and the Pennsylvania
Council on the Arts. Ochester
stressed that the series is not
speciﬁcally for Pitt students, and
encourages persons in and out of
the university to attend.

“One of the uses of the readings

.is to show what younger writers are

doing right now,” he said. “What
I've wanted for a long time. . .is
readings by younger writers, no

stars. These are all good people and
good readers.”

Waters, a participant in last
night’s readings, is an instructor at
Ohio University, associate editor of
The Ohio Review and a poet-in-the-
schools for the Ohio Arts Council.
He has published work in American
Poetry Review and Rolling Stone as
well as locally in Rapport and Three
Rivers Poetry Journal.

Carol Muske, the next scheduled
poet, has taught at the Women's
House of Detention on Riker’s
Island, organized a poetry series for
the Bronx Council on the Arts and

served as an assistant editor of ’

Antaeus magazine. Her book,
Camouﬂage, was published by the
University of Pittsburgh Press.

Fonda: Dedicated To Acting and Politics

By NANCY J. WINTNER

In Fred Zinnemann’s version of
“Julia,” there’sthe line, “there’s a
perfect time in every woman’ s life. ’ ’
Jane Fonda, who portrays Lillian

gellman in the ﬁlm, said that her

‘perfect time” has arrived.

In Fred Zinnemann’s version of
“Julia,” there’s the line, “There’s
a perfect time in every woman’s
life.” Jane Fonda, who portrays
Lillian Hellman in the ﬁlm, said that
her ‘ ‘perfect time’ ’ now has arrived.

“I have had several lives,’’

\I\. _  .'
.-»; A
. ,

Fonda, 39, said over a mid-after-
noon lunch. “It’s just that this one
will continue for a while. It’s a
pretty perfect time in my life, in so
far as the blending of political
beliefs, work and my family. It
makes it more thorough than it has
been before.”

Fonda was in Europe for ﬁve
months when ﬁlming “Julia,” and
she only spent ﬁve weeks of that
time with her family. Due to the
strain it imposed on her family,
Fonda said, “I’ll never do it again.
That’s why so many families break
up.

“My children have to come

    

Political activist and actress Jane‘Fonda is seen with Vanessa Redgrave in a
scene from the new movie “Julia,” which is opening in Pittsburgh next week.

ﬁrst,” she added. “That’s why this
national speaking tour I'm going out
on is only two days a week. It leaves
too much of a burden on my
husband. Kids must be secure,
stable and have a sense of their own
identity. Idon’t want to do anything
that would be a strain on family
relations.”

Fonda has come a long way since
those days when she portrayed the
Farrah-Fawcett image in
“Barbarella,” a science ﬁction sex
comedy the actress says was the
ﬁrst of its kind. “Barbarella” is
scheduled to be re-released in
Pittsburgh next week.

“I hope people enjoy it,” Fonda
said. “When you consider some of
the shows being shown today
(which, by the way, I’m totally
against), “Barbarella” is very
tame. _

“I have no regrets about making
it,” she added. “I have done so
many silly things that if I regretted
all of them, I would be paralyzed.”

One of Fonda’s recent pictures,
“Fun With Dick and Jane,”
gorssed $20 million. She said she
thoroughly enjoyed making the
movie.

“It had real, nice, funny people in
it,” she said. “It showed I hadn’t
lost my sense of humor. It was
perfect timing for a comedy when
political activism can make you look
ugly.”

But Fonda said her political
activity only helped to improve her
acting. Without it she said, she
couldn’t have portrayed such a

powerful character as Lillian in
“Julia.”

‘ ‘My acting career is much better
now,” she said. “Our (ﬁlm star,
Vanessa Redgrave and Fonda)
overlapping political careers, and
our friendship in real life, added
much depth to the ﬁlm.”

Asked how her father, Henry
Fonda, viewed her political acti-
vism, Fonda said, “The moment I
maried Tom Hayden I was okay.

“My dad saw a lot of good people
destroyed and manipulated by
communism,” she continued.
“And he thought I was being
manipulated. One year I’m in
‘Barbarella’ and the next year, all

- hell broke loose.

“Also, my father was a veteran
who fought in a war with meaning.

It was hard for him to become
accustomed to an anti-war
movement.”

Fonda said, though, it was

“extremely important” that her
father understood her motives.

“If my father didn't under-
stand,” she added, ‘ ‘there would be
a whole section of people in this
country who wouldn't understand.
And if these people don't under-
stand, you can’t build a
movement.”

Besides “Julia,” Fonda will play
the lead in “Coming Home,” a
movie about the wife of a Marine
captain who becomes involved with
a paraplegic Vietnam veteran.

The movie, based on an idea of
Fonda’s, will be released in
February. Her other ﬁlms include

I

“Comes A Horseman, ’ ’ with James
Caan, “China Syndrome,” current-
ly in pre-production for next year
and “A House Divided,” a
revolutionary ﬁlm featuring all
three Fondas: Henry, Jane and
Peter.

Speaking informally before a
theater arts group at Stephen
Foster, Fonda answered questions
pertaining to entertainment, lend-
ing speciﬁc advice to students
interested in acting.

“In the screen actors’ ﬁeld,” she
said, “there is 90 per cent
unemployment. All I can say is,
become active participants in drama
programs and get as much
experience as you can. Because if
you go to a big city such as New York
without any experience, without
any techniques or conﬁdence in
yourself, it can be lethal.

“Find out who the major casting
directors are, set up interviews, and
have professional pictures taken,”
she added. “Don't just send them
(the casting directors) sloppy
pictures that may have been taken
by your friends, but good picttires
that reﬂect your dramatic ability.”

Fonda also suggested ways to
become a producer such as getting
actively involved in directors’
training programs.

Before venturing downstairs to
the theater’s social hall for a wine
and cheese party in her honor,
Fonda told the students that her
make-up person was “the ﬁrst

J oel’s Erratic New Album

By PHILIP SCALAMOGNA
Piu News Sratt‘ Writer
Billy Joel
The Stranger
Columbia

Billy Joel’s latest album, “The
Stranger”, wavers between good
and bad. Some cuts show real talent
while others do not. The lyrics
range from the poetic to the inane.
Generally however, the album is not
bad, showing Joel’s potential in
music.

On the first side, “Movin’ Out”
plays well, but the lyrics are
puzzling and blank in meaning.
“He’s tradin’ in his Chevy for a
Cadillac...Andif he can’t drive with
a broken back...At least he can
polish the fneders’ ’ is an example of
lyrics that certainly are beneath the

singer’s potential.

“The Stranger” has much better
lyrics, expressing the
people’s true feelings: “We all
have a face that we hide away
forever. And we take them out and
show ourselves when everyone has
gone/’

The following out, “Just the Way
You Are,” displays rich vocals by
Joel and a nice bluesy alto sax by
Phil Woods.

The last song on the ﬁrst side,
“Scenes From an Italian Res-
taurant,” is the best song on the
album and probably one of the best
Joel has done. His piano keeps up
with the changes in tempo. The
lyrics ﬂow easily, telling the story of
a young couple as they go together
and split apart.

Student Government Programming
Committee, which sponsored
Fonda’s appearance, the actress
discussed the $2.8 million law suit
she ﬁled a few years ago against the
CIA, FBI, Bureau of Narcotics,
several banks and Richard Nixon.
She filed the suit in reaction to a
“conspiracy” to harrass and
intimidate her for her anti-war
efforts.

Her bank transactions were
investigated, her ‘phones were
hugged, her mail was illegally
opened and she was followed
everywhere.

“And I never did anything
illegal,” Fonda said during the cab
ride to the airport. “They amassed
this information and made me look
like something I’m not.

“It made me understand that

when vou’re dealing with the
government, you have to expect to

be viewed as the enemy.”

A Washington Post article
indicated that government lawyers
did not think Fonda’s constitutional
rights were violated by the
investigations.

“Thinking of what the govern-
ment’s like, it doesn’t surprise me
at all they feel this way. They aren’t
going to admit my rights were
violated—that’s an admission of
guilt.”

It will be along time, possibly six
years, before the case reaches court
because of the legal procedures
involved, she said.

‘ ‘What was done to me is only the
tip of the iceberg,” she added.
“The reason I’m suing is so CiVil or
class action suits such as this will
probe further into government
agencies used to undermining our
democratic rights. Hopefully, this
suit will make it hard enough for
them not to do it again.”

The best cuts on the second side
are “Only the Good Die Young”
and “She’s Always a Woman".
The former selection has a nice beat
and decent vocals by Joel, the latter
cut_ is a well composed ballad.
J oel’s vocals are excellent here, rich
and ﬁlled with feeling. His piano
provides a nice, soft background to
the song.

“Get it Right the First Time”
sounds decent, but displays, once
again, ridiculous lyrics such as
“I’ve gotta get it right the first time.
. .That’s the main thing. . .I can’t
afford to let it pass. . .You get it
right the next time that’s not the
same thing.”

As for the remaining selections,
“Everybody Has a Dream” and
“Vienna,” they don’t stand out in
any particular way, but on the
whole, they’re not bad.

“The Stranger" certainly shows
Joel’s talent both as a musician and
a writer despite its rough spots. If
he continues to progress the way he
does on this album he should
develop into a very good artist.

many girls as I could and general
all-out raving. And after a while, it
just took its toll.

“Now, I guess I’m trying to
strike a balance and not always
chase a type of ‘fool’s gold’ form of
happiness,” Lynott continued.
“Because as you get older, you
learn, and we’re just trying to
communicate that to other people
in our mus1c.”

As for the “punk rock” idea,
Lynott feels Thin Lizzy is not a
punk band per se. He said he
thinks it’s healthier to have kids
listening to punk bands, whose
members say and sing about what
they feel, rather than the sugar-
coated, emotionally lacking and
commercially programmed pomp of
a Donny and Marie Osmond.

Opening for Thin Lizzy was
Graham Parker and Rumour, an up
and-coming rock band from Eng-
land. Parker’s set was well-
received, although the crowd was
unfamiliar with his music.

Brown said quietly upon receiving the game ball after the
Panthers trounced Navy, 34-17. Brown, pressed into a

Scots Absorb Boaters’
Scoring Onslaught, 6-0

By JEFF DUROSKO

Pitt’s soccer team kept their

NCAA playoff hopes alive by_

dumping a young Edinboro club
Wednesday night at Pitt Stadium
6-0. The victory puts the Panthers
record at 5-4-1.

The Scots were never really in the
game as the Panthers held a 3-0
halftime advantage, adding three
more goals in the second stanza.

“Edinboro is a young and
inexperienced team. It was clear
that we had much more depth,” Pitt
coach Leo Bemis said. “I didn’t
want to run the score up—besides,
many of the backup players gained
valuable game experience.” he
added.

Despite winning handily, the
Panthers may have lost sophomore
fullback JerryTomassetti for
tonight’s _ game with a badly
wrenched knee. However, Tom
Kunkle did an excellent job ﬁlling
his shoes in the second half.
Standout Marty Moyer didn’t play
against Edinboro after straining
tendons in his ankle against
Youngstown State last Friday, but
should return to action tonight.

“To be considered for the _

playoffs, we’ll have to win all oflour
remaining ﬁve games,” Bemis
stated. “If we can bump off Penn
State, our chances will improve
drastically, and, the way the guys
have been playing lately, I think I
can see light at the end of the
tunnel. We’ve been able to move
the ball better, have had good
defense, our momentum is growing
and spirit is high.”

The Panthers will play their last
home game tonight at 7 p.m.
against Grove City, the defending
Western Pennsylvania Collegiate
Champions.

“We expect a real good ball
game,” Bemis stated. “They beat
us last year 3-0 and our fellows
remember that. They're a hustling
ball club, but on paper, we're
close.”

starting role in place of injured Tom Brzoza, helped his
team rack up over 500 total offensive yards against the
Middies’ pride and joy, their defense.

By KAREN KADILAK
Pin News Staff Writer

Pitt football player Walt Brown
calmly approached head coach
Jackie Sherrill and offensive line
coach Don Boyce shortly before the
opening kickoff of Saturday's game
between Pitt and Navy at Pitt
Stadium.

Informed he was going to start in
place of the injured Tom Brzoza at
center only a couple minutes
before, Brown has a few words to
say to the two Panther coaches.

“I just told them they didn’t
have to worry about anything,” the
junior center recalled at a practice
this week. “I thought they might
be worried about the way I felt,
since I was starting for the ﬁrst
time. I told them not to be
concerned. Everything was going
to be okay.”

Indeed, everything was as Brown
ﬁlled in admirably for Brzoza, who
sprained his ankle in the Panthers’
34-17 win over Navy and still
remains questionable for tomor-
row’s game against Syracuse at Pitt

Stadium.
But there still was some doubt as

to whether Brown could do as ﬁne a
job as he did. First, it was a new
experience for him. He never had
started before in his three-year
career at Pitt. Second, he was
replacing Brzoza—a guy many
consider to be the best center in
college football today. The pres-
sure was on and Brown knew it.
“I was real nervous during the
week,” Brown said. “I seemed to
have thought about the game more
than I usually do. I was definitely

more excited than I ever was for a
game. It was just a different

feeling.

’s All Right 

“All during the week,” Brown
continued, “I kept on wondering
whether I was going to start or not.
Whether Tom was going to be
ready or not. You're bound to be a
little apprehensive. And I was.”

So was Boyce, but for different
reasons. The offensive line coach
knew Brown could play, having
seen his superb snaps in punting
and kicking situations. He knew
Brown had the ability, but whether
he could handle the new pressure
and do well starting was a different
story.

“It was the first time he 

starting,” Boyce said in explaining
the situation. “That, and the fact
that I hadn’t really seen Walt
center the ball all that much since
fall camp.

“We always knew he had the
talent,” Boyce continued. “It was
just a matter of his getting the
experience. That’s why I didn’t
know what to expect from him
Saturday.”

In retrospect, what Boyce saw
impressed him. Brown proved he
could do the job offensively.

“There’s no question that Walt
gained conﬁdence out there Satur-
day,” Boyce pointed out. “If we

:

have to use him against Syracuit,

which we might have to do if
Tommy’s ankle is still sore, I won’t
be as worried.

“Walt showed he could play,”
Boyce said enthusiastically. “And
when you consider that the Navy
nose guard (Brown's primary
responsibility Saturday) was in on
only three defensive plays all
afternoon, you know he did a good
job.”

Swider ls Philosophical

By KAREN KADILAK
Pin News Snail Writer

Former Pitt punter Larry Swider
doesn’t admit to being into
philosophy, but when discussing
his recent tryout with the St. Louis
football Cardinals and his latest
ﬂing with the National Football
League, the former Panther does a
bit of philosophizing.

“I see the light at the end of the
tunnel,” Swider, now a part-time
assistant coach at Pitt, said before
a recent practice session at Pitt
Stadium. “And it makes me happy.
Someone has ﬁnally showed an
interest in me.”

It was a philosophical and happy
Larry Swider who sat—strangely
not among books on Aristotle and
Plate, but booklets containing
football plays that lay scattered

xsq.

 

along the long table-—discussing
his future in football.

Rejected by the Minnesota
Vikings and by the Denver
Broncos, who drafted him in the
seventh round of this year's annual
player draft in May and then cut
him midway through the presea-
son, Swider said he is optimistic
about playing pro football in the
future.

“I see the light at the end of the tunnel,” former Pitt pun- Cardinals of the National Football League. “Someone has

ter Larry Swider said of his latest tryout with the St. Louis finally showed an interest in me.”

Wilson photo

 

If not this year, then next. And it
could very well be with the
Cardinals, who were impressed
with the one-day kicking show
Swider put on during his tryout
several weeks ago.

Swider impressed the  3%
staff with the hang time (time the A

ball is in the air) and distance he
got on his punts.

In fact, if it weren’t for the
Cardinals wanting to go for
experience over Swider’s inex-
perience, the likeable punter may
be playing for the Cardinals right
now. But instead of signing Swider.
the Cards signed Duane Carrell,
who has had NFL experience with
the Los Angeles Rams and New
York Jets.

There’s still a chance SW" 9:

may be called this season, ju's Est}

former teammate Carson Long was
brought up by the Buffalo Bills
recently. Also, the Pittsburgh
Steelers could be in the job market
for another punter, considering
problems Bobby Walden has been
having of late.

g But, not wanting to build a false
sense of hope, Swider has his
sights set on next year. He ﬁnally
feels wanted.

“I’m a Cardinal rooter now for
sure,” Swider said enthusiasti-
cally.

It is a happy Larry Swider .
walking around these days. It  ~

be an even happier one when he
gets that chance to play pro
football, “that light at the end of
the tunnel."

Friday, October 21, 1977-—THE PITT NEWS—I’age 13

Fun rip Van-quished

This week’s column comes to you from Penn
Hills, Somerset, Breezewood, University Park,
Maryland and many other locations somewhere
along the way.

Trying to write or study while traveling for
considerable lengths of time in a car, bus or van
can be an exasperating experience. This
weekend, the women’s cross—country team has

 

squeezed 10 persons into the blue van shared by
several Pitt teams, including the water polo and
golf squads.

The destination is the University of Maryland
and it shouldn’t take longer than four or five
hours to get there (but no one will bet on it).

During the first hour everyone jokes around,
figuring there’s ample time to study later. Even
so, text- and notebooks are brought out and the
van is silent...for about 10 minutes. Suddenly,
FM radio music blares from the speakers and,
eventually, a group discussion on homecoming
begins.

The van hasn’t even reached the turnpike when
someone asks, “Are we there yet?” Head coach
Alfreeda Goff sighs and nudges, the accelorator
down a fraction of an inch. '

As miles and hours pass, the radio reception
becomes fuzzy and somehow the clearest station
is one playing “doctor’s office” music. It may
very well put everyone to sleep, but a least it’s
not distracting to those trying to read.

Becky, who has been sleeping throughout the
trip so far, awakes and reads an Organic
Chemistry book. Conversely, a few others put
away their study materials to catch up on some
lost nap time.

When given the choice, most people would

  

much rather sleep than study, but after Jenny.
the lone senior on the team, smiles and announ.
995 10Ud1Y that “we are students first, then
athletes,” it is apparent that no one is giving us a
choice. Back to the books.

Studying is more or less out of the question

once the team reaches University Park, because
the focus of attention becomes practice, the meet
and, especially, dinner. The meet is run smoothly
and undefeated Maryland sweeps the first five
places—which is demoralizing, to say the least.
1 After a typical on-the-road lunch at Arby’s,
the return to Oakland begins. Now, the
motivation to study seems greater, but so are the
distractions. Alexandria station WXRA radio is
broadcasting the Navy‘ football
game—therefore, those wishing to hear the game
and study at the same time are half-concentrating
on both.

I am attempting to write, a feat made difficult

while the van rumbles down the highway, when-

Pitt scores its first touchdown.(cheers and scat-
tered applause).

“Well, I’ll tell you,” says Navy announcer
Pete Larson, “Sometimes it’s better if you let
your opponent score first, because then your
defense digs in and won’t give up any more...”
Pitt scores again. (More cheers).

This time Larson refuses to comment, so his
partner grumbles after the ensuing kickoff
“Don’t they (the Pitt band) know they’re not
supposed to play when the other team has the
ball? It’s not right!”

Shortly after a Panther fumble, WXRA fades
out, replaced by the Boston College-WVU game
and then Penn State-Syracuse.

A voice from a back seat groans, “Do we have
to listen to football? Come on, play some
music!” The coaches oblige and switch stations.

Familiar buildings and landmarks are
gradually appearing; Oakland is not far away
now. Within half an hour, the van eases its way
up through Forbes traffic. Not everyone accom-
plished as much schoolwork as she would have
liked; I didn’t. At least, as you can see, I did
finish my column.

Pitt News Staff Writer

With their attitude problems
hopefully a thing of the past, Pitt’s
water polo team travels to Indiana
this weekend to face the top teams
from the Midwest.

It will be a journey into unknown
territory for Pitt, as the Panthers
never have played in Indiana's
pool. Nor have they faced any of
the other teams before, except for
the host Hoosiers, who were

ated in the Pitt Invitational.
George

will make the trip. In all probability
he will return to the starting
lineup. On the other hand, starter
Butch Silva has been suspended
indeﬁnitely.

In the early rounds, the Panthers
will meet Illinois and Purdue.
Illinois has a tradition of ﬁne water
polo teams; its 1974 squad was
among the nation’s best. The
Boilermakers feature a stingy
defense, led by the goalie from the
national team of Argentina.

thers will face this weekend
relies on overall team speed in
driving to the goal, Pitt will switch
to a zone defense in an effort to
eliminate the advantage in quick-

gﬁince virtually every team the
n

ness. The zone is designed to
function much like the infamous
basketball “amoeba defense,”
putting pressure on the ball as soon
as it is advanced into the offensive
zone.

“Teams like Indiana just drive to
the goal constantly,” head coach
Miguel Rivera explained. “This

zone will make it easier on us _

physically, and will keep us out of
foul trouble. It will also beneﬁt
Steve (Feller) because their shots
will come from the sides, which are
easier for him to handle.”

For the ﬁrst time in weeks, the
Panthers will ﬁeld a healthy squad;
Mike Mere’s cut has healed and
several other players have recov-
ered from the flu.

Pitt will be looking to Luis Tore
and Barry Ford to increase their
scoring output during the remain-
der of the season. To date, Toro
has concentrated on getting the
ball to the open man; he now will
be asked to look to the goal as well.
Ford was one of Pitt’s most
consistent scorers last year, but
thus far has failed to equal that
production.

One of the biggest surprises of
the season has been the return of
senior Mike Schoﬁeld. Schoﬁeld, a
member of last year's squad who

temporarily left the team because
of academic difficulties, now is
providing the Panthers with the
hard, accurate shooter they have
been lacking. In his ﬁrst full
weekend of competition, Schoﬁeld,
a Pittsburgh native, led the team in
goals. He registered eleven goals
in thirteen shots.

“Mike should be able to help us
a lot down the stretch,” Rivera

observed. “He hustles, works hard
in practice and plays intelligent
polo. His strong arm makes him a
scoring threat from anywhere,
especially in the smaller pools.”

The Panthers, coming off a ﬁne
showing at Cornell and a week's
worth of impressive practices, need
to avoid the mental errors that have
plagued the team this year.

The Pitt women's cross country
team lost a tough dual meet to the
University of Maryland last
Saturday, despite Becky Falck.
Brenda Chorpenning and Maria
Scuillo placing well in the meet.

The match was held on the
university’s golf course in College
Park, Maryland. The facilities are
excellent and the three-mile course
was in good condition.

“The Maryland team was very
good,” Diane Wiegel, a freshman
runner, said. “They have many
good runners and have recruited
some excellent freshmen.”

Pitt was hurt when it lost two
runners. Therese Walton, a fresh-
man starter, sustained an injury and
was unable to compete. This was a
blow to the team because Walton is

the number-two runner, usually.. 

ﬁnishing one or two places behind
Falck. Kathy Paczkowski quit the
team because the four hours of daily
practice interfered with her partici-
pation on the basketball team.

This saturday, the Pantherettes
will host an invitational meet in
Schenley Park at 11 a.m. A team
from Penn State, along with other
teams from the state, will compete.
The Pantherettes will have the
advantage of knowing the course
well. but the meet should be
challenging for the team-
especially if Walton is still unable to
participate.

Future Hockey Funding?

BYJIMPANE
Pitt News Staff Writer

Chancellor Wesley Posvar has
promised the Pitt Hockey Club a
spot on next Thursday’s Athletic
Department meeting agenda to
discuss future plans for club
funding.

The promise, the best the club
has received as to University
funding in its six-year history, was
made at Wednesday’s Student
Affairs Advisory Committee
(SAAC) meeting. At that meeting
Hockey Club president Alex
Sanchioli presented the committee
with a three-year plan concerning
joint funding by the Athletic
Department and Student Govern-
ment. '

Sanchioli said he was forced to
go to SAAC with the proposal when
he recieved no response from the
University Athletic Committee
about the issue.

Student Government has been

the sole source of funding for the

Hocke Club in the past, allotting a
reported 58,000 this year, but
according to Wednesday’s SAAC
agenda, Student Government feels
it “cannot afford to fund the
Hockey Club at a level that would
allow them to compete with other
teams of similar caliber...We fully
support the hockey team in its
efforts to gain University support
and we feel it would be a
tremendous waste of athletic ability
and ambitious desire to not allow
the team to develop further.”
The club’s proposal calls for a
joint venture by Student Govern-
ment, which would supply approx-
imately S7,200 per year, with slight
annual increases, and the athletic
department, which would allot
$87,000 over the three-year period,
according to Student Government
Board member Chip Hubbard.
“How far the club gets on this
proposal depends a lot on how well
they present their proposal and

board,” Hubbard added.
club has proven that they are ready
to go varsity, and the athletic
department should seriously con-
sider the request.

how much sway (athletic director
Casmir) Myslinski has on the
committee,” Hubbard said.
Wednesday’s meeting with SA-
AC, according to Hubbard, was
primarily to bring the issue before
Posvar and, though he didn’t
commit himself, Posvar “seemed

very receptive” to the idea.

Another Student Government
Board member, Dave Hesidence,
was quoted as saying “the Hockey
Club shouldn’t be punished for
being as good as they are.”

“That’s the opinion of the entire
6lTVhe

_ “The club could be in serious
trouble if they don’t,” Hubbard
said. “They may even have to
disband.”

Pantherettes Do Without Starter

By CINDY NATALI

Nightmares of losing a number -
one player plague‘ all coaches at
some point. And nightmares, like
dreams, sometimes come true.

Pitt’s women's tennis team still
squeezed out a 6-3 victory over
Indiana University,(Pa.) last
Tuesday minus its number-one
player and two other key netters.

With top singles performer Maria
Paris in the hospital, Nancy
Bellestreri sidelined with a knee
injury and doubles player Ber-
nadette McNally also out, rookie
talents helped Pitt throttle the
Indians for the second time this
year.

“It was tough match and they
played very well,” said assistant
coach Erma Pytka. ‘ ‘The absence of
some major players couldn't shake
the team’s conﬁdence.

“We were optimistic about the
match, but we didn’t know it was
going to be such a good win.”

Rookie Jennifer Mullan turned in
the best win of the day and was
dubbed “star of the evening” by
Pytka. Playing her first singles
match for Pitt, she beat Sue Danjou
in two sets, 6-4, 6-1. Mullan played
in one doubles match earlier this

season and Pytka felt Tuesday’s
contest was “a good win for her.”

Janis Irwin played especially
well, according to Pytka. She edged
out B.C. Cinelli with a 7-5 ﬁnal set
after splitting earlier sets, 6-3, 2-6.

The Pantherettes dropped two
singles matches and the ﬁnal
doubles contest. Moving into the
number-one position, Jan DeCostro
downed Sally Moore in straight
sets, 6-1, 6-2. Pam Bachman held
out for three sets befor losing 2-6,
7-5, 6-4, to Cheryl Mistrick. A
strong 6-0, 6-2 win decided the
number-four match with Pitt’s Jan
Brownstein defeating Sally Bissell.
Leis Moses lost to Paula Spinelli,
6-2, 6-1.

The ﬁrst doubles duo of DeCostro
and Bachman overpowered Danjou
and B.C. Cinelli, 6-3, 6-2. After
dropping their ﬁrst set, 0-6, Irwin
and Brownstein bounced back to
win 6-3, 6-3. Mullan and Moses
dropped their match with Maryann
Collie and Spinelli, 6-1, 7-5.

“It’s hard losing your number -
one player,” stated Pytka, “but all
of the girls played well.
Maria(Paris) and Nancy
(Bellestreri) will both be out for the
entire season, however, Ihope they

will be recuperated for practice in
April.”

The team visits Robert Morris
College for the ﬁnal match of the
season Tuesday.

Cincinnati Defender To Appear
Before NFL Commissioner Rozelle

By The ASSOCIATED PRESS

CINCINNATI (AP) — Defensive
back Mel Morgan of the Cincinnati
Bengals was notiﬁed Thursday to
ﬂy to New York for a Monday
Hearing with National Football
League Commissioner Pete Ro-
zelle. ‘

The request came after Rozelle
viewed ﬁlm involving an incident
which occured in Mondays nation-
ally-televised game at Pittsburgh.
Morgan delivered a forearm to the
face of Steeler receiver Jon
Stallworth, who had caught a pass
and was running with the ball.
Stallworth suffered a mild concus-
sion but returned to the game.

Morgan was called for unsports-
man like conduct and a I5-yard
penalty was levied against the
Bengals. Morgan said he will meet
with Rozelle at ll a.m. Monday.

Prior to the season,‘ Rozelle

issued a strong warning to NFL
players emphasizing that excessive
violence will not be tolerated. His
statement came in the aftermath of
the George Atkinson-Lynn Swann
incident last year that ended up in a
$2 million slader suit.

Atkinson, a cornerback for the
Oakland Raiders, gave Swann,
Pittsburgh’s premier wide recei-
ver, a concussion after throwing a
forearm to the head. He lost his
Suit against the Steelers and their
coach Chuck Noll.

Morgan, a second-year safety
out of Mississippi Valley College,
said he expects to be ﬁned or
suspended. He said he regrets the
action, adding that the blow
“wasn’t intentional. It was just a
reﬂex. I was surprised at myself.”

Mike Brown, assistant general
manager of the Bengals, said he
would not pre-judgethe controver-
sy.’ “We would understand and

accept the commissioner's decis-

ion.”

“The violence issue is at the
forefront and we don’t disagree
with action to prevent unnecces-
sary violence. We aren’t pleased
that our team is involved,” he said.

It is the ﬁrst time in the Bengals’
10-year history that a Bengal has
been called before the commis-
sioner, Brown said.

Five plays after Morgan's incident,
Bengals’ tight end Bob Trumpy
was felled by a blow from
Pittsburgh’s Mel Blount. Trumpy
was temporarily knocked unconsci-
ous and complained of loss of
memory.

No penalty was called. “I was
going after the ball,” said Blout.
“I didn’t even see Trumpy. Ithink
when the league ofﬁcials see the
play, they'll pardon me just like
they did Nixon.”

Swimming Season Nearing;
Tankers To Work On Skills

By ANGELA VAVITHES

Pitt’s men's swimming team was
ﬁrst in the East last year, and when
you’re the defending champion, you
can’t afford to make mistakes. And
this year, coach Dick Bradshaw
doesn’t intend for his swimmers to
make any.

Swimming season doesn’t begin
until December, but a swimmer
can’t afford to wait to start
preparing for upcoming meets. The
Pitt swimmers will have to be
especially prepared this season,
which will begin in a difficult dual
meet with North Carolina, a top
Southern team that Pitt never has
competed against before.

competed against before. This meet
will give the swimmers and coaches
a good idea of what areas need more
work.

Pitt began getting ready as soon
as school started and they work
every day on the various aspects of
swimming, ranging from ' _'
work to build endurance to strok .3’
and breathing techniques.

Bradshaw is very happy with the
way his team looks.

“We’re stronger than we were
last year and I feel we have more
potential,” he said. “We weren't
weak -in anything last year, but
we’ve added more depth to some of
the areas that needed it.”

Bradshaw also was excited about
the way the freshmen team
members are shaping up. As far as
recruiting is concerned, this was the

“most successful year in  

swimming history,” according to”

the athletic department.
‘Among the 10 freshmen are four

Yankee ’s Jackson In

A Dodgers’

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

NEW YORK(AP) - If Reggie
Jackson's crystal ball had forecast
the tumultagand tension of the 1977
Yankees,‘ he would have been
wearing Dodger Blue in the World
Series.

“If I had known what kind of year
it was going to be, I would have
gone to San Diego or Los Angeles,
probably Los Angeles,” said
Jackson Thursday. Do you think I
would have come here? I wouldn’t
wish that on anybody.

“I never really talked to the
Dodgers. I didn’t give them that
courtesy. I should have. But
Steinbrenner was around all the
time and put too much pressure on
me."

Jackson was referring to George
Steinbrenner, the owner of the
Yankees whose super selling
jog-and $2.9 million check for five
years-grought last year’s free-agent
prize to New York.

Steinbrenner’s reward for
signing Jackson and supporting him
through his season-long crises was
that he now owns the best team in
baseball, courtesy of Jackson and
his teammates’ six-game victory
over the Dodgers.

J ackson’s rewards are more
vicarious.

“My triumphs are not home runs
and RBI and cars,” said Jackson,
whose three consecutive homers in
Game 6 won him the Most Valuable
Player Award and a car from Sport
Magazine. “My thrills come from
others.”

Jackson said his thrills come from
seeing his sister, Tina Jones, light
up after Reggie gave her the Series
car as a gift or seeing Tina’a baby,
Alesandra, ﬂash a toothless smile.

' 7
Unrfonn .

The emotions Jackson feels from
his summer of stress and strain are
relief and peace. -

It was ironic that the same
magazine that gave Jackson a car
started him on a very lonely road

last spring, quoting him as saying: _

“I’m the straw that stirs the drink.
It all comes back to me.”

That remark was a dig at
teammate Thurman Munson, the
Yankee captain and the American
League’s Most Valuable Player in
1976. Munson never was able to
forgive Jackson.

“If I had it to do all over again, I
would never have met the guy from
Sport in a bar and talked about some
of the things we talked about,”
Jackson said.

With the alienation from his
teammates and Jackson's frustra-
tion taking hold, he isolated himself
further by refusing to shake their
hands after a homerun. Then he
almost got into a ﬁst ﬁght with his
manager, Billy Martin, during a
nationally televised game in
Boston.

But those controversies were
temporarily swept under the table
by Jackson’s hot bat in September,
which drove the Yanks to the AL
East crown, and his powerful
performance of ﬁve homers, 10 runs
scored and a .450 batting average in
the Series.

The Yankees now respect Jack-
son’s baseball ability, something
he’s been ﬁghting for all along.
And to this proud, sensitive man,
that’s more important than any car
or award.

“On my tombstone, Iwant it to be
written that ‘He was respected and
liked,”’ Jackson said. “Respect
me, like me if you want to. But
respect me first.”

ByTHEASSOCIA'l‘ED rnnss

NEW YORK(AP) - It should ‘have
been the happiest moment of Billy
Martin’s life, his ﬁrst world
championship as a manager, but the
peppery little skipper of the New
York Yankees was having trouble
rising to the occasion.

“I’m not trying to be subdued,”
Martin said Thursday in the wake of
the Yankees’ ﬁrst world title in 15
years. “I’m just ﬂat cut tired, but
nobody believes me.”

Although 1977 produced a World
Series triumph after 1976 ended in a
disapjpointing four-game sweep at
the hands of the Cincinnati Reds,
Martin insisted that the just-
completed baseball season was
“3,000 times tougher than last
year.”

The reason, of course, was the
perpetual turmoil surrounding the
Yankees during which Martin was
almost ﬁred on ﬁve separate
occasions, only to surface as the
world champion manager with a
vote of conﬁdence from manage-
ment plus a hefty bonus and a
swanky automobile. g

It would seem that all Martin has
to worry about now is the Billy Loes

Martin hashad to live with over the
years isthat he couldn't win two in a

He managed the Detroit Tigers to

into the 1975 season. But now
Martin has proved he can win two in
a row-pennants at least, although it
remains to be seen if the Yankees
can repeat as world champions.
Each ﬁring followed a clash with the

PHILADELPHIA(AP) - Reggie
Leach and Bill Barber each scored
two goals as the Philadelphia Flyers

Clarke tallied a goal and_ three
assists and winger Don Saleski

scored his sixth goal of the season,
‘high in the NHL and ran his point

Placed On
Mail Ballot

(Continued from Page I)
departments will eventually be
housed in the Cathedral of
Learning.

Professor G. Alec Stewart,
director of the University Honors
Program (UHP) gave an update on
that program.

Stewart explained, that as an
intial start, 20 courses will be
offered this winter term as honors
courses to undergraduates with a
QPA of at least 3.25, or, with
permission of the insturctor.

Stewart said this was only the
beginning of the UHP, explaining
that in the future he hoped an
honors degree for undergraduates
could be offered.

tion.” he said. “Now they'll have a
helluva time ﬁnding a reputatiorrfor
me, won't they. I'll be ‘ 

Abraham Lincoln-ﬁnd out whatlbfeis

drinkingandgiveittotheoth
managers." 

Part of the problem is Martin’:
insatiable desire for victory.

“Winning hasbeen everything to
me,” he said. “I’ve lived it. I
preach it. I don't turn it on and oﬂ
like a clock. But it’s different as a
player and as a manager.

“As a player you’re out there
doing your part and helping your
team. But as a manager, you’re up
there at bat with every player, and
as a manager you've got so many
other things you’re doing-as you
read this summer.

“There were timeslwasaslow as
aperson can get. But I never walk
out on Yankee fans. This may sound
strange, but I'm a great lover of
Jesus Christ. When I get down I go
to church, light a candle and come
back strong.

But while Martin and the
Yankees came back strong, the
feeling probably also will persist
that every kiss-and-makeup session
is just the calm before another
storm. Not every pain has been
relieved.

“The World Series always makes
up for a lot of thing, but it won't
close all the wounds,” Martin said.
“There are wounds in me you can
drive a truck through.

“It started right from spring
training. It was altogether
different. Last year, everybody left
me alone to do my thing. This year,
everybody was maddling. I think I
run a helluva spring training camp,
no matter what anyone says.”

But for now, everything is calm,
cool and collected. Whether there

will be a next headline-making '

chapter is anybody’s guess,
“Peaches and harmony.” Billy
Martin said. “I like it.”

Swimming Coach
Bradshaw Hopes
To Cut Mistakes

(Continued from Page 14)

Jeff Treu from Shaler High School,
was all-State for three years and
state champion in ﬁve events for
three years. His specialty
freestyle and he also swims the
sprints and distance events.

Mickey Termin, from Central
Dauphin East High School in
Harrisburg, also is a freestyler,
swimming middle-length events
such as the 200- and 500-meter
freestyles.

A Pennsylvania state champion
sprinter named Tom McGinley
came to Pitt from Bishop Hobin
High School in Wilkes Barre and
swims the 50-and 100-meter
freestyle. —

A name likely to pop up a lot is
Stewart Swanson. He comes from
Sarasota High School in Sarasota,
Fla., and specializes in the
backstroke and distance freestyle.

He’s an all-American in both 4

strokes and also is ranked 10th in
the world.

In addition to these fine
freshmen, 15 other swimmers from
last year will be competing this
season. With all of this talent,
Bradshaw feels that the toughest
competition this season will be the
social life on campus and the
individual member’s morale.
