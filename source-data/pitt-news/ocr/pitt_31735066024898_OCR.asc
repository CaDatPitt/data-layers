Needleman charges

unanimously cleared

By Megan Bertino
Editor in Chief

Dr. Herbert Needleman was
unanimously cleared of charges
of scientiﬁc misconduct by the
panel that heard testimony from
Needleman and other
researchers in April.

According to Needleman, he
recently received a letter that
confirmed the panel’s find-
ings but the decision is not
final. ’

Jerome Rosenberg of Pitt’s
Office of Research Integrity said
Needleman will have until June
1 to respond to the letter. The
panel’s findings and
Needleman’s comments will then
be forwarded to Pitt’s
Department of Health Sciences
and from there will be sent to
the National Institutes of Health
in Washington, D.C., for a final
decision. —

Until the NIH reaches a

investigation will stay under strict
conﬁdentiality rules.

Needleman said he opposes
the confidentiality rules because,
“I believe in openness.” He also

said he would like his name _

cleared rapidly and widely.

Rosenberg said he could
“neither confirm nor deny”
Needleman’s remarks, but he
expects some announcement will
be made once the NIH ﬁles its
report.

Claire Ernhart of Case Western
Reserve University, the principal
researcher to testify against
Needleman, said she would not
comment on the matter until
she receives a full NIH
report.

Needleman became the center
of controversy early last semester
when the NIH asked Pitt to
investigate claims that he

Neighborhood groups have begun copying Los Angeles gangs

depicted on television, city police said.

Last week there were four drive-by shootings patterned after the Los
‘Angeles gangs. Pittsburgh Police Sgt. John Linn said gangs in
Pittsburgh are just neighborhood groups and are not organized

enough to be real gangs.

— “There are no organized gangs in the city of Pittsburgh. [The groups
in Pittsburgh] are more like a neighborhood thing and call themselves
a gang,” Linn said. “[The groups] would like the prestige of being a

gang.”

The shootings took place in the Homewood—East Liberty area. Three
youths were shot by four men in a Honda Accord on Susquehanna
Street, Homewood, at 9:25 Tuesday evening. Ten minutes later,
another man was shot standing on a street corner in East Liberty by

three men in a Honda Accord.

At 12:55 a.m., a woman was shot in the right leg on Wilner Drive,
East Hills, by two men in a black Buick. Then at 3:30 a.m., a man was

Presby and Montefiore improperly disposed medical waste

Byjulie Sabol

News Editor

Presbyterian University and Montefiore
Hospitals admitted that they illegally mixed
medical waste with regular garbage, but
Manager of Presby’s environmental health
and safety office JoAnna Shimek said the
problem had been corrected for over a
yean

“The incinerator ash problem is old; it
has been cleared up for many, many
months,” Shimek said. “Our ash is being
handled according to the state guidelines.”

The recent questioning arose as part of
an-inquiry brought about by someone
who asked what was happening at the
hospitals, Assistant Deputy Director for
environmental health services Wilder
Bancroft said. '

“It wasn't being hidden at any time. The

situation was remedied at the end of
1990,” he said. “It came up as a part of
another inquiry that occurred as a result of
someone asking what was happening at
the hospitals.”

Health services found out about the
violations through a 1990 survey, Bancroft
said. _

“We found the two hospitals had a
practice of incinerating the waste and then

mixing the residue with the same
containers as the trash. Under state
regulations they aren't allowed to do that;
they must be separated,” Bancroft said.

Under state law, medical and other
waste must be both treated at the site at
which it’s produced and then separated
from other garbage. -'

The hospitals were sanitizing the
waste but not separating it from other
trash.

Bancroft said there are two manners of
treating medical waste, incineration or

. sanitization in an autoclave. The leftovers

from both processes, ash from incineration
and the medical items from the sanitization
method, must be specially bagged and
then sent to a permitted landfill
authorized to take the waste, Bancroft
said.

Shimek said the hospitals had been
unaware of the change in guidelines which
required the separation; as soon as they
became aware of them, they immediately
stopped the disposal.

“Both hospitals were notified [of the
violations] at the time and have
discontinued the practice,” Bancroft said.

No fines or punishments were issued to
the hospitals for their actions. “We just
ordered them to comply with the
regulations and they did — they were

willing to cooperate,” Bancroft said.

Both the hospitals and Bancroft said the
public “was not at danger during the
violation period because the first step of
the disposal process was properly
followed. ,

“The regulations are designed to permit
regulatory agencies to track the waste and
make sure all proper precautions have
been taken.

The public was not really at danger;
there was not any violation of the treatment
of the waste  The waste was being
properly treated and rendered safe.

The technical requirement they failed
on was to keep the waste separate,”
Bancroft said.

“It’s not our intent to cause any harm to
the environment. We cooperate with all
regulatory agents; we have nothing to
hide here," Shimek said.

Katz, FAS clash over undergrad business school

By Heather Gahres
Asst. News Editor

The Katz Graduate School of
Business and the Faculty of Arts.
and Sciences are still on opposite
sides regarding the possibility of
an undergraduate business
school.

“[The Katz Graduate School of
Business] proposed to restructure
the undergraduate business
program to better serve students
seeking a career in business,”
Director of Undergraduate
Programs Edward Palascak said.

The plan would allow day and
evening students to specialize in
different areas of business, such
as accounting, finance,’ marketing
and general management, he
said.

“The general management
degree would allow students to
concentrate on international
[business], management systems,
human administration, small
company administration and
management information,”
Palascak said.

Some of the new required
courses proposed are
Management and Informational
Systems, Ethical Analysis of
Management Decisions and an
International Business course,
Palascak said. “The proposal
also includes specialty labs
linked to three courses that will
help students develop key
managerial skills,” Palascak said.

The proposal is not new to the
faculty; it was discussed by FAS
last November when it then
spoke out against it, Dean of
FAS Peter Koehler said.

“Do we still need such a
program in today’s world, when
people are changing jobs so
frequently? And should la
student's] education be broader
than a narrow professional
training to allow adaptability?”
Koehler said of the proposal.

KGSB Dean H.J. Zoffer said
the University of Pittsburgh
needs a BS/BA. The
undergraduate business school
would make Pitt comparable to
other schools, he said.

“An arts and science degree
often is not what employers are
looking for,” Zoffer said.

Zoffer said that when looking
at the proposal people should
question whether or not
undergraduates at Pitt should
have the option of a business
degree.

Koehler said the proposal
points out the positive aspects of

' the BS/ BA but seems to disregard «

its cost. The proposal would mean
hiring additional faculty and
would increase the burden of
certain departments, Koehler
said.

“If [the proposal] would take
place, the impact would be
severe, especially in departments
like English writing and foreign
languages who are already having
difficulty. It would make arts and
sciences a service school to
provide basic requirements for
professional schools,” Koehler
said. .

‘FAS had also criticized the
proposal due to an already

existing problem of lack of space A

for classrooms and offices.

Palascak said the university
would address those space issues
if the proposal was passed by the
Board of Trustees. He said there
was a proposal to build a new
building for the proposed school.

The funds would come from
donations, Palascak said. “We
would mount a capital campaign
to raise resources from individual
donors and institutions for the
undergraduate business college.”

The remaining revenue would
be in tuition. The undergraduate
business school's tuition would
be similar to that of the School of
Engineering.

“The current proposed tuition
[for the undergraduate business
school] is 13 percent higher than
the current CAS and CGS rate but
substantially lower than the tuition
rates for the Schools of
Engineering, Health Related
Professions, Nursing and
Pharmacy,” Palascak said.

The new degree would bring
approximately 1,000 new students

Nationality rooms director recognized for achievements

By Casondra Sobieralski
For The Pitt News

Awarded for her tireless efforts,
service and leadership in the field
of intercultural exchange and
understanding, Pitt Director of
Nationality Rooms and
Intercultural Exchange Programs
E. Maxine Bruhns recently became
the second woman ever to receive
The World Affairs Council of
Pittsburgh’s Glick Award.

"Besides coordinating, planning,
overseeing, designing and
fundraising for Pitt’s nationality
rooms, Bruhns works in
conjunction with 34 ethnic
committees in the city, such as
The Gaelic League. She also
arranges scholarships and faculty
grants for summer studies abroad.

This summer she has enabled
22 Pitt students to travel to locales
as diverse as Africa, Israel and
Taiwan. Because her position
requires an intimate knowledge
of foreign cultures, Bruhns’s career
affords her the excitement of
overseas travel as well.

She has visited Israel, Armenia,
Siberia and Africa. While in these
distant lands, she said she
surveyed their study—abroad
programs. ‘

Before coming to Pitt, Bruhns

and her husband lived in Lebanon,
Austria, Viet Nam, Iran, Greece
and Africa. Having experienced

the excitement of living abroad, I

Bruhns said she knew she did not
want to settle into a sedentary
desk job involving numbers and
raw data.

Maxine Bruhns received an award for her dedication to‘ cultural understanding.

Initially coming to Pittsburgh
because her husband wanted to

pursuehis Ph.D. at Pitt, Bruhns _

acquired her career position in
1965 on a part-time basis. The
directorship was opening at the
time, and she was there with her
international experience to fill it.

She has held it ever since.

When Bruhns is not working
at the university, she said she
enjoys folk dancing, photo-
graphy and “getting back to
nature.” Enthralled with animals,

Second, find a way to study
abroad or to gain international
experience in other ways. Look

for universities with strong~

international programs and
corporations that promote
relations with other countries.
Right now, for example, there is
much corporate growth potential
in Asia, she said.

Third, be aware of world events
and international political
climates. You do not want to end
up in the midst of unrest unless
you are prepared to handle such
situations, she said.

Overall, maintain a perspective.

on personal relations, she said.
Respect others; respect their
lifestyles. “Keep listening to
people until you understand, [and
you will begin to] see differences
as wealth,” Bruhns said.

Bruhns is in the 27th year of
her directorship, and she said
she plans to continue her career
for several years. In the future
she said sheintends to complete
Austrian, Japanese and Indian
rooms.

She said she would eventually
like to develop rooms to represent
new immigrant groups such as
the Vietnamese.

She added that she would like
to see more
involvement with the nationality
rooms locally.

Stujfed Quayle

With the economy in trouble, college graduates facing

the worst job outlook in recent memory, racial tensions

mounting and a polarization of wealth in America, Vice
President Dan Quayle leaves political discourse “Lost in
Space.” In a new twist, popular television shows can enter

“The Twilight Zone” of politics.

Commenting on the Los Angels riots, Quayle blamed a
“poverty of values” for the violence, looting and destruction.
This assessment is true, but it is his own adrninistration’s
lack of values in question.

The Vice President chimed, “Marriage is a moral issue
that requires cultural consensus and the use of social
sanctions. Bearing babies irresponsibly is simply wrong.”
He then chastised Murphy Brown, a single mother on
television. Quayle, out of touch as usual, said if families
just instill “values” in their children, social problems will
end. '

It must be understood that the Bush administration is
speaking, not just Quayle.

His amazing analysis begs the question, “Who instills

. the values?” Single mothers or fathers, same-sex couples '

with children or even good friends can make a loving,
caring family. Love is the ingredient. Anyone who watches
“Who’s the Boss,” “The Cosby Show” or “The Simpsons”
knows that — this should include Dan Quayle.

Quayle’s allegiance to a male-female nuclear family is
foolhardy. If Murphy Brown, Carol Brady, Tony Masselli
or June Cleaver can make a home loving for a child, that
character should be supported all the way for family
choices. , I

‘Economic devastation destroys family values — Quayle

should be familiar with this fact.

Restructuring of the U.S. economy has resulted in the
elimination of jobs for more than 20 years — those

I hardest hit by the reshuffle have been marginal peoples,

particularly people of color. No matter how you look at
the picture, Republicans have dominated the White
House since 1968 with only a four-year gap. The Vice
President should be a little more familiar with the
economic scene.

In an election year when Bush’s record as President is
more than questionable, it is understandable that he
would want to divert attention to a nice, vague debate on
“family values.” Similar tactics helped Bush win the
election in 1988. “Family values” joins smoke-screen
issues such as Willie Horton, being a card-carrying
member of the ACLU and the Pledge of Allegiance.

Ronald Reagan asked America in 1980, “Are you better
off?” When diverse families are struggling with one or two
incomes to just get by, the same question will plague the
current administration. No matter how much Quayle,
Bush or the rest of the placated Republican right whines
about “family values,” reception will not improve.

Love will not leeep us together

Memories of my high school -
teachers are filled with visions of

Mr. Shrivelprune and ,Ms.
Fuddyduddy. Hour after hour the
class would sit and listen to
lectures given by these people
who were old enough to be relics
from the Middle Ages and were

boring enough to put even the.

most attentive of students to sleep.

Where was Pamela Smart when I -
V was in high school?

In 1990, Pamela Smart was a
school teacher from New
Hampshire who had an affair with
her sixteen—year-old student and
eventually convinced him to
murder her husband. Surely Mrs.
Smart would have been a better
teacher, or at least a much fonder
memory, than Ms. Fuddyduddy.
She was young, attractive, plotting
to seduce her students to kill her
husband; what else could a high
school ask for?

And talking about lasting
memories, on the talk show circuit,
a student who claims to have
received genital herpes from his
art teacher is now suing for
damages.

It seems as if the Pamela Smart
case has brought forth more
people claiming to have engaged
in sexual relationships with their
teachers, or other people in
positions of authority. A Harvard
student committed suicide after
having an affair with his
psychologist, a professor at the

university. Ms. Fuddyduddy never
did these things.

These cases raise questions
concerning the morals of present
day America

If two adults engage in sexual

activities willingly there are not .

any problems, but what happens

. if the relationship stems from a

doctor/ client situation? If a doctor
betrays the trust the patient has

  Dave
Buder

given him or her by engaging in
sex, even if the patient is a
consenting adult, -.the doctor’s

license to practice should be‘

revoked.
The doctor/patientrelationship

usually occurs when the patient is l

in need of some kind of medical
attention, thus leaving the patient

“vulnerable. If the doctor breaches

this trust by making (or accepting)
sexual advances he or she often
makes the patient’s condition
worse, as in the case of the Harvard
student.

This defeats the entire purpose
of the patient’s going to the doctor
in the first place. The Harvard
student had definite problems ._.
this is why he sought the help of
a professional.

For the professional to start a
sexual relationship only

compounds the patient’s
problems, making him or her
worse off than before (and also
out a lot of money).

Professionals who betray this
trust should face stiff punishments,
because there is no reason for this
type of behavior‘ to be taking
place.

The fact that Pamela Smart had
her husband murdered is bad
enough, but it is the way she
plotted his murder that shocked
people. Seducing your students
is not the best way to murder
your husband.

I realize that each of these »

professions has a strict code of
ethics and that they are expected
to be upheld, but those who
break these codes should face
severe penalties

Professionals who violate client
trust are making things worse for
those who are seeking their help.
Any report of professional
misconduct should be treated as
seriously as if it ended in a fatality.

Let's look and see where these
people are today. Pamela Smart’s
teenage lover is in jail, the Harvard
profes'sor’s boy toy is dead,
another student I has herpes...,
maybe I was better off with Mr.
Shrivelprune and Ms.
Fuddyduddy

I sympathize with D.avid
Fincher, the director of Alien3.
Not only has he never directed a
feature ﬁlm before (he is mostly
known for directing music videos
and TV commercials), but his
first attempt is a sequel to a
sequel, which several potential
directors quit or were fired
from because of script
disputes.

Poor guy. It’s a long jump from
Madonna to Sigourney Weaver.

Fincher also had to deal with a
couple of facts. One, that the first
movie, Alien, directed by Ridley
Scott, was a classic science ﬁction
horror movie. Two, the second .
movie, Aliens, directed by ﬂashy
James Cameron, was a classic
sci-ﬁ adventure-action flick. It is
a tough act’ to follow, and
unfortunately, this follow—up is
anything but a classic.

Not that Fincher didn’t try. But
it is hard not to judge it against its
predecessors, (which I did) and

Shrieky clean. The extraterrestrial is back, but howbd is it?

I Alien3 lurks in the shadow of predecssors

 

  

 

 

there it failsto meet the standard
by a wide margin.

Alien3 quickly begins where
Aliens left Off. During
disconcerting opening credits,
interspersed with five -second
action bites and the first bit of the
movie, we discover that Warrant
Officer Ripley (Sigou rney Weaver,
of course) has crash landed on
Fiorina 161, a mostly abandoned,
lice infested, maximum security
work correctional facility. It is
inhabited by a small-group of
prisoners who found religion and,

Fincher had a huge budget to
use for his cinematic debut. The
sets are large and imposing and
are brilliantly designed. The
cinematography is inventive, as
shown by the interestingly
dissonant opening credits. Fincher
is willing‘ to try different things
with his cameras.

But the movie never reaches
out to the viewer. As people are

predictably killed off one after
-another, there are very few
-instances where you can tell who

was killed when. Unlike the first

all the characters well enough
that we cared when they became
alien puppy chow, most of the
prisoners on this planet are simply
movie meat. With their bald
heads, I couldn’t tell one from
another.

Weaver was as good as ever,
which is no surprise. But what

was with that alien? At first, it was

kinda scary, but during most of
the movie I didn’t even tremble.

A major reason is because the
tension level is fairly low. The
situation for Ripley and the
never

drastically. In Aliens, the situation
of the characters was in an almost
constant flux, almost escaping,
almost being destroyed, that kept
the tension level high and
exciting. Instead of being scary,
Alien3 just ended up being gross
and disgusting. There is an
autopsy and a death by exhaust
fan that are gory beyond
necessity.

The hastily rewritten ending is
probably the worst part of the
movie, and the climax is hard to
follow and simply doesn’t make
sense. Fincher seems to try to

imitate Cameron’s directing style,
and although he does a passably
good job, imitations don’t make
good movies. This shows,
especially at the end.

Alien3 simply could not stand
out from its brethren. It is without
a doubt the runt of the litter, even
though it compares favorably to

other 're'ce’nt”sci‘-fi ‘movies, like”

Total Recall (although I wasn't
fond of that either). .

. Being such a fan of the first
two, I don’t regret seeing Alien3.
But unlike the first two, I don’t
plan to see it again.

TRSF’s Midsummerlsfor kids of all ages

By Megan Bertino
Editor in Chief

‘A Midsummer Nights.Dream may be a '

little above the comprehension of most
kids, but the Three Rivers Shakespeare
Festival’s children’s adaptation of the show
includes enough slapstick and one-liners
to amuse audiences of all ages. '
The show is performed by only four

‘actors, Barbara Stuart, Barbie Williams,

Jeffrey DeVincent and David Fielding,
who slip behind the back curtain or, in
Fie1ding’s case, change their garb in
front of the audience to play other
characters.

While in some cases the change of
costume and character is amusing, the
audience, predominantly children under
the age of ﬁve, seemed confused and
disoriented as Fielding went from narrator
to town caller to Lysander before their
very eyes.

The shortened and watered-down
version, or as the narrator explains “the
40-minute version,” of the play carefully
avoids any reference to characters’ past
sexual behavior and greatly diminishes
the roles of some of the play’s
most famous characters, particularly
Puck.

The fairy scenes themselves are reduced,
most noticeably the scene in which Titania
fawns over an unpleasantly transformed
Nick Bottom. She quickly expresses her
enchantment without a single kiss to his
ﬂoppy ears.

Stuart, who plays Puck, is comical as

. she sneaks around Oberon, King of the
Fairie,. but her famous character is only”

give about three minutes of stage time,

. making the role becomes more confusing

than amusing to the audience.

Snout, played by Williams, is not
introduced until the ﬁnal scene in which
he . portrays the Wall in Thisby and
Pyramus. While Williams’s comical
overacting brought some of the loudest
jeers from the audience, the Wall was
confusing without any prior reference or
explanation.

Other scenes pertaining to Tbisbyinclude
only Bottom, played by DeVincent, and
Francis Flute, played by Fielding. While
the scenes are narrowed to just these two
characters, they are the most endearing in
the show. Fielding truly steals the show
with his comical and convincing portrayal
of the elderly Flute.

But he is closely rivaled by DeVincent,
whose portrayal of Bottom rendering
his dramatic role as Pyramus is out-
standing.

DeVincen expertly overacts and
amusingly plays the prolonged
traditional Shakespearean death
scene.

As the narrator explains in his
introduction, the shortened version still
contains 1,000 lines of text which move at
a phenomenal pace, sometimes making it
difficult to understand the dialogue. The
narrator often summarizes scenes in
advance, but I doubt a viewer would

be able to follow this fast—paced
adaptation without having read the
play.

Other quick one-liners which modernize
the script are added. The narrator explains
that the four lovers wandering in the
woods are about to encounter fairies by
telling the audience they have entered the
Goblin Zone, followed by “Twilight
Zone” hums from Fielding and
DeVincent.

The four players make unusual
Shakespearean actors, wearing sweatpants
and black sneakers as the basis for thrift-
shop shawls and robes that allow for their
character changes.

The least likely costumes are those of

the fairies. Oberon’s mask is the most

plausible, while Puck and Titania look

strange with blue faces that lack_

feature distinction. Bottom and Flute wear

amusing townspeople garb that
makes them appealing to the
audience. A

This show, directed by Mark Kittlaus,

was adapted for high-school audiences.
Another version, directed by Gillete
Elvgren, was adapted for elementary-
school audiences. The players took the
show on the road from January to April
and performed in 110 schools in the tri-
state area.
A Midsummer’s Night Dream is
playing at The Pit every Saturday at 11
a.m. through August 1. Ticleets are

Actor debuts

in Two Gents

By Julie Sabol
News Editor

For Laura Ann Worthen the theater
has not only changed her lifestyle,
it’s changed her attitude as well.

“I never thought I would be an
actress. I went to Brown for pre-
med and didn’t get an A in chemistry,
but I did get cast in the first play I
auditioned for, so I took that as a
sign,” Worthen said with a satisfied
smile. “I was sort of shy and had
found this outlet that made me feel
not shy. I always learned by
performance.”

Worthen, who abandoned the
idea of a career in the medical ﬁeld
to pursue one in the theater, now
teaches in Pitt’s theater arts
department. Her performance as
Julia in the Three Rivers Shakespeare
Festival's Two Gentlemen Of Verona
marked her debut to local audiences.

“By my second year at school, I
decided to follow through with a
career in theatre arts. After that
everything kind of fell together,”
Worthen said. “I love being an
actress. I’m crazy about it,” she said.

Crossing the country in order to
get the roles she wanted, Worthen

said she has learned to adapt to
different situations and has
consequently defined her role as
an artist more clearly.

“I would go insane if I didn’t
have an ability to adapt relatively
quickly. I have an ability to say,
‘Oh this is my home now.’ _If you
don’t have this, you would lose
part of your soul,” Worthen said.

“I form myself to fit into the
qualities that are already present
 my personal life has definitely
had to take a back seat,” she

 

’ said.

She also had to give up some of
the control in her life for a more
unstable lifestyle.

“You don’t really control your
own career; the few who can do
it with money,” she said.

Worthen views acting as a
complex field, more than just
getting up on a stage and
performing lines.

“The times are gone where you
can just be an actress. In the '40s
and ’50s you could do this, but it’s
a much more diverse world now,”
Worthen said.

Though many actors live for
performance night, Worthen said
she is just the opposite. To
Worthen,.rehearsal is much more
enjoyable than the actual
performance.

“Ifl could only be in rehearsal
I’d probably be pretty happy,”
she said. “I like the constant
change. I’m constantly on my
toes to correct or clarify.”

rehearsal also relates to her love
for teaching. “I like teaching
because it’s not about results, it’s
about how you get to the place,”
XX/orthen said.

“You are an artist first who then
spends a given amount oftime in
a day mentoring young artists,”
she said.

To get her mind off daily
pressures Worthen turns to her
garden. '

“It’s one of those things I spend
two hours and look at my watch
and think it’s been only 10
minutes. Johnny Appleseed, I
like to think of myself)’ she
said.

As well as an actress and
gardener, Worthen considers
herself a feminist.

“Someone_ told me I gave a
feminist reading of Julia and I
was very happy that my feminism
had become subliminal, that I
don’t have to access it anymore,”
she said.

"I have noticed that woman
actors are much less empowered
than male actors,” she said.

“This is due to the educational
system and the tradition-
al beliefs many Americans have.

"When men are aggressive
they’re good, but when women
are they’re bitches,” Worthen
said.

Feminism is not only part of
her acting life, it’s part of her
personal life as well.

“I’m a feminist and I’m trying
to do it on all fronts,” she
said.

Pens come back to stun Blackhawks 5-4in game one

By Ryan Buncher
Asst. Sports Editor

Redemption was the operative word
for the Penguins as Mario Lemieux scored
the winning goal with 13 seconds left for
a 5-4 victory over the Chicago Blackhawks
in game one of the Stanley Cup Finals.

The Penguins made enough mistakes
to fall behind 3-0 in the first period and 4-
1 in the second last night at the Civic
Arena. The power play looked terrible.
They lost too many face-offs. They
continually ﬁred long shots on Blackhawk
goalie Ed Belfour as he handled them
with ease. Worst of all, Mario Lemieux
was making mistakes as he tried too hard
to make everything perfect.

The game-winning goal came on as

power play. It was set up by Ron Fr-ancis_’
.winning a face—off and Belfour’s giving
up a rebound on a long shot by "Larry
Murphy. Redemption came as Lemieux
grabbed the rebound and went top-shelf

over a fallen Belfour. _

Early on it was Belfour who kept the
game scoreless as the Penguins came out
strong.

The Penguins were ﬂying high after a
sweep of the Boston Bruins in the Wales
conference ﬁnals and were bolstered by
the return of winger Bob Errey from a
separated shoulder. Much like the Bruins,
the Blackhawks seemed unable to handle
the speed of the Penguins.

Then the Penguins made a mistake.-

Chicago was able to get some offensive
pressure after a ‘turnover by Pittsburgh’s
Shawn McEachern. Then a holding penalty
by Gordie Roberts of the Pens gave the
Blackhawks a power play. Brent Sutter
won the draw forthe Hawks then took out
Francis, allowing Chris Chelios to cut in
and blast a shot through Pittsburgh
goaltenderT om Barrasso for a 1-0 Chicago
lead.

After shutting down a Penguin power

to 2-0 on a goal by Michel Goulet. Chicago
defenseman Steve Smith nailed Jaromir
Jagr with a check along the boards in the
Penguin end, forcing aJagr pass to go right
to Goulet.

_ Less than a minute later it was suddenly"
3-0 Chicago. A scrambling Pittsburgh

defense was unable to clear the rebound
of a Cheliosshot from danger, and Dirk
Graham shot it into an open net. The
Blackhawks were on exactly the kind of
roll that allowed them sweep the Edmonton
Oilers in the Campbell Conference Finals.

The Penguins were able to pull within
two goals late in the period. They were

' struggling on another power play when

Phil Bourque swooped on a ‘loose puck
behind the Chicago net, charged out in
front and fired the puck" past
Belfour. —

The Penguins got no closer for the ﬁrst

10 minutes of the second period, and only -

strong‘ goaltending by Barrasso kept the
Blackhawks from extending their lead.

They ﬁnally did just that after Lemieux
made a costly error. He gambled and
charged to double-team Steve Larmer

with Ulf Samuelsson. Larmer passed the ”

puck to a wide—open Sutter, who ringed
a shot off the right foot of Barrasso for a

4-1 lead that seemed to take the Penguins ,

out of the game; ‘

Just after being shut down on another '
. power play, the Pens got back in the

game. Rick Tocchet tipped a long shot by

Paul Stanton over Belfour’s left shoulder. .,

Then the Penguins got lucky. Lemieux
went behind the net on a two—on—two

break and threw the puck toward the net. .

It bounced off the right knee of Belfour
and into the, net to bring the Penguins
within one. \

From that point until late in the third
period, the Blackhawks clamped down
defensively to protect their one-goal lead.
The Penguins have a knack for producing
great individual efforts‘ in such situations,

Pittatbletics braces
for alumni backlash

By Brian Gallagher.

Stajf1Vrz'ter

When the University of
Pittsburgh football program is
confronted with rules violations,
one is likely to think that the
presence of several roadblocks
on the road to a fresh start is all
but guaranteed. ' 9

For heavily sanctioned schools
like the University of Maryland
and Southern - Methodist
University, that was precisely the
case. Among the unavoidable
potholes impeding these two
schools were not only probation
and sanctions but also recruitment
difﬁculties, lower ‘revenue and
lack of alumni support.

One of these probable potholes
—\ alumni support —— threatens
to rear its ‘ugly head ﬁrst. But
surprisingly,rif reaction at Pitt is
half as positive as it was at a rival
Big Eastschool, this impediment
won’t be as sinister as it first

. appears.

Syracuse University, which
admitted 13 apparent rule
violations by its basketball
program to the NCAA in February
1991, followed the same in—house
confession-like inquiry as that of
Pitt football.

. While Syracuse ofﬁcials handed

the results of their in-house

inquiry to the NCAA around
Valentine’s Day 1991, over 15
months later a verdict or response

' by NCAA‘ enforcement is still

“£2

1!’

pending.
With the shadow of the axe

lurking over the Carrier Dome_

for a season and a half now, one
would think the threat of such
doom would have an effect on
support of Orangemen hoops.

But that is simply not the case. ‘

Contributions by alums and ticket
sales for both basketball and

‘ football are on pace to equal or

surpass totals for 1991, according
to Joe Szombathy, director of the
Orange Pack, the Syracuse
University athletic alumni
association.

.“We have pretty loyal fans,”
Szombathy said. “We’ve sold
5,000-6,000 more [football] season
tickets than last year. Most of
those seats — the best seats —
require contributions. And we’ve
received those contributions.

“That fact [continued support]
is a tribute ‘to what kind of fans
we have here [at Syracusel.”.'

While Szombathy admitted that
the strong football ticket sales
can be!‘ attributed to the
anticipation of “having a strong
team and  an ‘attractive home
schedule,” he stated that such a
factor doesn’t explain the fact
that alumni contributions or
reactions have yet to do an about-
face. ' c‘ _

“I can state emphatically that
no, we have not seen any negative
reaction to the allegations,”
Szombathy said. “Our fundraising
for this ﬁscal year will equal that
of last year.” ,

He added that the only apparent
anger or backlash in the reactions
of alums and fans comes in

_ response to false allegations in

the media as well as the inordinate
length of the NCAA investigation.

“Golly, our fans and followers
were more upset withthe false
allegations that surfaced in
newspaper reports than the actual
violations,” Szombathy said. “In
fact, there's more anger with the
waiting [for a ruling] than the
actual rules infractions.”

V Among the infractions revealed. .

in the inquiry of the'Orangemen
basketball program are giving
players cash, free meals and free
legal advice.

While not much has changed
in regard to recruitment and
support from alums, Szombathy
said everyone at Syracuse will be
more than relieved when the
decision is finally handed down.

“Boy, [the NCAA] sure know
how to string things out. It seems

play, the Blackhawks expanded theirlead

like we ’ve been under the NCAA’s ‘

eye forever. I hope Pitt doesn’t
have to wait this long,” Szombathy
said.

Bumbling Buccos lose 9 of 10, fall out of first place

By Tom Schneider
’Sta_ﬁ"W1‘iter

California dreamin’?

Right now the Pittsburgh
Pirates are California screamin’,
as teams from the West Coast

‘have been wreaking havoc on
the defending National League
Eastern Division champions,
allowing them one victory in
their last 10 games and letting
the St. Louis Cardinals take first
place in the East.

The losing skid started at the
tail end of the ‘Pirates’ last
homestand, when they suffered
a three-game sweep at the hands
of the San Diego Padres. The
Bucs then left for the Coast,
where they have so far been
swept in three games by the
Giants at Candlestick Park, lost
two of three tothe last-place Los

Keep a step ahead.

     

Angeles Dodgers and been stifled
by the Padres in the first game of
a three-game set at Jack Murphy
Stadium in San Diego.

Is this the same team that got
off to the fastest start in baseball,
with 14 wins in the first 18 games
of the season? Well, at the plates
they look the same, but on the
mound they look vastly different.

The Pirate starting rotation,
which was so dependable during
the first month of the season, has
gone sour throughout this West
Coast skid, a fact punctuated
with a horrible performance by
the usually ﬂawless Zane Smith.
Monday night against San Diego,
Smith gave up three home runs,
including a gargantuan upper
deck shot by Gary Sheffield, as
the Padres held off a late-inning
Buc rally to win the game 7-6.

The only positive aspect of this

game was that the Pirate bullpen
didn’t give up a single run in
almost four innings. Scoreless
innings have been hard to come
by for the Pittsburgh relief staff
lately, especially for Stan Belinda
and Roger Mason.
After Bill Landrum was released
before the season began,
everyone expected Belinda to
become the Pirates’ full-time
stopper. And through the first
few weeks of the season, he
proved that he could withstand
the pressure by quickly earning
six saves. Then Pirate manager
Jim Leyland started to platoon
Belinda and Roger Mason in
various situations. This misguided
game of “Guess the Stopper”
didn’t help either of the pitchers.
Both Mason and Belinda have
choked when called upon to pitch
during the past 10 games. This

fact was most apparent in the
second game of the Los Angeles
series, when both men combined
to successfully blow a three-run
Pittsburgh lead in the bottom of
the ninth inning to lose the game
and spoil a fine pitching
performance by Vicente Palacios
in his first start of the season.
In this game, Mason was called
upon in the ninth with the Bucs
leading 4-1 to close the door on
the Dodgers. He left shortly after
getting one batter out while
allowing one run to score and
leaving two men on base. The
fate of the Pirates now rested on
the shoulders of Stan Belinda,
who was brought in to face first
baseman Eric Karros. After
running the count full, Belinda
served up a fastball that Karros
promptly deposited into the left-
field seats, giving the Dodgers

home run Belinda gave up in as
many appearances.
The Pirate bats have not
suffered at all during this losing
. streak however. center fielder
Andy Van Slyke continues his
incredible performance at the
plate, remaining among the
league leaders in batting average
(.362), hits (54), runs scored (28)
and doubles (14). Barry Bonds is
looking for another MVP award
as‘ he has raised his batting
average to .503 after going 4-for-

league-leading 12th home run.
Before T uesday’s late game at

behind the first-place Cardinals

third-place New York Mets.

maneuvered by three Blackhawks
and fired a backhander by Belfour

- to tie the game with just over five

minutes left.

Chicago had a chance to win as
Mike Hudson cut through two
Penguins to draw a hooking call
on Murphy, but the Pens were
able to kill the power play. Just as
Murphy returned to the ice,
Lemieux charged the net and
drew the penalty on Smith which
set up the game-winning goal.

The Pen-guins head into game
two Thursday night with a 1-0
series lead. The Pens stole a win
in a game they should have lost,
just as they did in game one
against the Bruins. Pittsburgh just 
seems to forget the things that
win sometimes, but the team has
the talent to find redemption for
such sins. ‘

The eighth university student to contract

after a 15-day battle with the disease.

Robin Troupe, the third student to die
from the disease, battled against

caused by the Neisseria meningitides
bacteria.

Troupe was one of over 18,400 university
students vaccinated against men-

by the summer of 1993 and may cut nearly
1,000 more by 1995.

Fifty million dollars in budget cuts is just
the beginning.

The loss of millions of dollars more is
almost certain to mean more staffers out of
work, more programs out of com-
