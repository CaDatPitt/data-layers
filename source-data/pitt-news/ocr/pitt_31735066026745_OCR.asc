Pil-I Iries to erase deficit

By Paul Kogut
For The Pitt News

To erase a $5.7 million
budget deficit, officials at the
University of Pittsburgh are
delaying or eliminating a
number of construction
projects, equipment purchas-
es, service contracts and
hiring, a university official
said.

The delays and elimina-
tions, or “corrective action,”
are necessary to balance the
university’s budget before
the end of fiscal year 1995
on June 30, said Ben Tuchi,
Pitt’s senior vice chancellor

“It’s not possible to say the
deficit will be erased unless
these actions are taken,”
Tuchi said.

“Our goal is to come out of
fiscal ‘95 with a balanced
budget, and, as of right now,
the expectation is that the
budget deficit will be zero by
June 30,” according to Tuchi,
who sits on the school’s
University Planning and
Budgeting Committee
(UPBC). The UPBC is
chaired by the provost and
advises the chancellor on a
broad range of financial
issues.

Tuchi declined to name the

contracts and hiring that
would be delayed or elimi-
nated over the next few
months.

First, he said, he must noti-
fy the managers who will be
affected by the cutbacks

before he can release their

names for publication.

Besides that, the list of
managers who will be affect-
ed may grow or shrink as the
June 30 deadline approaches,
Tuchi added.

The university’s financial
officers “will constantly be
doing estimates on overhead,
sales, ' services, tuition,
rentals, etc. to see if there are

Pennsylvania’s Republican legislators are
proposing a new state law that would make
proving incidents of rape easier for sexual
assault victims.

At Pitt’s College Republicans meeting last
night, State Senator Melissa Hart said the
Pennsylvania legislature will pass a new law
within the next month that will allow for rape
convictions, “with less evidence of physical
force.”

Currently, Pennsylvania law requires evi-
dence of physical force to prove allegations
of rape. But according to Hart, this is often a
problem for victims because there is not
always visible-evidence of physical abuse in
rape cases.

According to Hart, women don’t always
physically resist acts of rape out of fear that

they might sustain greater injury, or even
death, if they fight back. These women do
not always have signs of “physical evidence”
on their bodies after rapes occur. Oftentimes,
neither do women who are raped at knife-
point or gunpoint.

Because of the current legislation’s reliance
on physical evidence to prove rape, sexual
assault cases become “he-said-she-said
arguments a lot of the time,” said Hart.
Under the new “No Means No Law,” the
“she-said” side will carry more weight in the
courts.

Under the “No Means No” proposal, men-
tal coercion, threats of violence" and use of
weapons can all conceivably be used to prove
that a rape occurred.

According to Hart, this proposal will great-
ly affect college campuses, where,” situa-
tions of sexual assault probably happen

Dean
attends
G-7
forum

By Anthony
Breznican
Staff Writer

Imagine having almost
any information ‘you
could want worldwide at
your ﬁngertips. .

Representatives from
the world’s seven leading
industrial countries got
together for a conference
in Brussels, Germany
earlier this month to dis-
cuss a global information
society that_ could bring it
to you.

Traditionally the G—7
Conference consists of
government employees
only, but this year 50 pri-
vate sector representa-

tives went along, includ- _

ing Toni Carbo Bearman,
dean of Pitt’s School of
Library and Information
Sciences.

The representatives

participated in discus—.

sions on the development
of the network’s structure

and regulation of its a

framework.

The discussions helped
to form the Chairman’s
Summary which includes
ideas on promoting com-
petition and investment,
providing open access to
other networks and
ensuring security and
property rights for mate-
rials.

“This is meant to be a
diverse type of network,
just as there are diverse
types of transformation
systems to get around the
world,” Bearman said.
“You can take a pay
highway or small back
roads. Take a train or ﬂy,
etc. There are many dif-
ferent alternatives, and I
think that's one of the
strengths of this.”

One of the main objec-
tives of the summary is
to make the information

_ accessible to the widest

range of people possible.
“|_"The network] allows
a much wider dissemina-
tion of information, and
as you have new ideas
you can share them and
people can critique them
almost like an informal
discussion group at a cof-
feehouse,” Bearman said.

OTTAWA — Canada warned
yesterday that it was pre-
pared to seize a second
Spanish vessel fishing in a
disputed area off the coast of
Newfoundland.

The Spanish vessel moved
intoa rich fishing zone on
Tuesday, despite warnings
from Canada that it will seize
any vessel found fishing
there. «

Last Thursday, Canadian
patrol boats fired shots at and
seized another Spanish ves-
sel, claiming that it was
depleting the number of fish
through illegal fishing prac-
tices. ‘

The seizure infuriated the
European Union, which froze
formal contacts with Canada.

WASHINGTON — U.S.
Attorney General Janet Reno
asked Congress yesterday for
more money to help fight

At a Senate Appropriations

chaired by Gramm, Reno
asked for a 20 percent
increase in the Justice
Department’s budget inorder

to hire more federal agents,
and provide grants to local
law enforcement agencies.

Gramm and other

WASHINGTON — Despite

Poorer schools that may not
have the money to purchase
quality materials for their class-
rooms are one example of the‘
possible educational benefits of
the various photographs, maps
and texts that would be avail-
able on the network, said
Bearman.

“It would help tremendously
in the research process, and in
acquiring and ﬁnding the infor-
mation we need,” Bearman
said. 4

People with disabilities that
would hinder their ability to go
out and gather educational or
informational materials would
beneﬁt too, she said. ,

“Think of the power you
could give them to compensate
for many of their disabilities, to
gain access to information that
they normally couldn’t get

because they’re homebound,”

Bearman said.

Bearman said eventually the
network’s abilities could be so
far reaching that many students
would not have to physically be
in a classroom to learn the
material they need.

“This allows much better dis-
tance education,” she said.
“Instead of reading a text book
or a couple of articles you can
surf the Internet and get [the
same] information, and newer
documents.”

The network will also allow
users to collaborate around the

world much the way the

Internet does now.

“You could write a paper with
somebody in China and Italy at
the same time,” Bearman said.

The idea of open accessibility
to all information has its conse-
quences though.

“Some information should be
kept private, like medical

' records. There are important

questions related to protection
of privacy and intellectual prop-
erty,” said Bearman.

The possibilities of the pro-
posed network are still in the
development stage, but the G-7
Conference helped to tackle
some of the problems that could
aid the network’s evolution.

“We need what is referred to
as a' broader band-width,”
Bearman said.

smaller less-deve1oped'coun-
tries are very important to the
development of the network.

Another problem is educating
people on how to gather the
information, she said.

“A lot of people don’t know
how to use the new technolo-
gy,” Bearman said. '

While much of the network is
still in development, Bearman
said she believes progress is
being made.

“We have lots of pieces of it
already. The Internet is a very
big part of this of course,” she
said. “We’re talking signiﬁcant

Budget

°From page 1

any other deficiencies that
have to be overcome by cor-
rective action, or to see if
there are any unforeseen
increases that would assist us
in solving our problems,” he
said.

University officials already
have had two unexpected
savings in fiscal 1995 that
could be used to help balance
the budget.

The university has saved
about $1.3 million in
health insurance premiums,
said James Holland, a mem-
ber of the UPBC and presi-
dent of the University
Senate. About $700,000 in
utilities were also saved
because of the “relatively
mild winter,” according to
Tuchi. 0

According to Tuchi, action
in other areas will be
taken, but he declined to
comment on it further,
saying, “It’s just little bits
and pieces.” It will account
for “roughly a couple
hundred thousand dollars [in
balancing the budget,]” he
said.

The budget deficit was
formally announced to
the UPBC at the groups’ Jan.
12 meeting, said Philip
Wion, a member of the com-
mittee. '

At that meeting, Tuchi
blamed more than half the
deficit, about $3 million, on

an unexpected shortfall in
enrollment. This spring, the
university has 32,591 full
and part-time students. That
number is considerably lower
than what the university’s
budget-makers had anticipat-
ed.

Another $900,000 of the
budget gap can be attributed
to the costs linked with the
university’s early retirement
program, Tuchi said.

Jeffrey Liebmann, the aca-
demic planning associate for
the Office of the Provost,
said,i“The university is fac-
ing a potential deficit,‘ and it
is the role of the UPBC to
help the university avert that
deficit.”

However, Wion, also a
chair of one of the UPBC’s
three subcommittees, said the
UPBC makes “only recom-
mendations” to university
officials; it does not write
formal policies on financial
issues. That is left up to the
chancellor and vice chancel-
lors. '

“It’s manageable,” Holland
said about the deficit. “It will
be in balance [by the end of
the current fiscal year.]
We’re not talking crisis
here.”

But Holland said enroll-
ments at universities across
the nation have been in
decline.

“I certainly hope it’s a tem-
porary one,” Holland said.

Casinos require caution

The city of Pittsburgh could be receiving up to $22 million
in new revenues a year, if the state legislature were to legalize
riverboat gambling. According to the Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette, a report by Gaming Consultants Group said this
money would drop if Ohio and West Virginia were to open
gambling houses of their own. Still, the group suggested in its
report that Mayor Murphy should lobby the legislature for a
15 percenttax on the casinos’ profits.

Allowing casino gambling in Pittsburgh may help the city.
It should go through provided that it does not create the kind
of situation it is easy to see in other gambling cities: decadent
opulence immediately adjacent to abject poverty. Pittsburgh
is a post-industrial city caught in an identity crisis. Because it
is in ﬂux in terms of what will be its future economic base,
city planners must be very careful with what solutions they
seek to Pittsburgh’s economic woes.

Mayor Murphy’s economic director, Stephen Leeper, was

— quoted in the Post-Gazette as.saying thatthe riverboat casi-

nos weren’t being considered as the solution to the city’s
problem. He alsosaid there were no plans to raise city taxes
to pay for roads and other services for the casinos, should
they be approved. Instead, he said any money gained from
casino revenues would be used for economic development.

This would be the best use for any increased revenue
gained from having. riverboat casinos anchored along
Pittsburgh’s rivers. Also suggested was using the funds to
lower taxes. Nevertheless, gambling should not be used to try
to turn Pittsburgh into a carbon copy of Atlantic City. Many
other cities, such as Detroit, Mich., are considering allowing
casino gambling. There will be competition in the future, so
the city government, nor the people of Pittsburgh, should
count on the arrival of riverboat.casinos as a wellspring of
new jobs.

Still, if when balanced against all other social and econom-
ic factors, casinos can be used to bring the city some extra
revenue without destroying other economic and social options
in the city, then casinos should be allowed into Pittsburgh.

Awareness must be raised

'8 Recently at Gateway High’ School several students were «found
handing out racist ﬂiers calling for the hunting of minorities.
According to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, four students had dis-
tributed 50 to 100 ﬂiers last Thursday morning before they were

confiscated. '
In response, the school district is working in conjunction with

the local chapter of the NAACP to heighten awareness about

racial issues. With suspicions about outside involvement with the
ﬂiers, it is important to get community groups involved with pre-
venting further incidents of this kind.

Because education raises awareness, it also raises tolerance.
Students at the high school level live in a more insular environ-
ment and can thus be easily inﬂuenced within it. It is important
to reﬂect on the true purpose of an education which is to provide
students with the capacity to question the ideas they confront.

Affirmative action won '1‘ promote racial hannony

brought the
debate on afﬁr-
mative action
back to the
front of the
national news

    

Columnist
Ton
Dic ensheets Described by
many as one of
the key “wedge” issues in the
r1996 presidential campaign,
the public is getting an early
preview because of events on
both coasts.

The first is the debacle on
the campus of Rutgers
University after President
Francis Lawrence uttered these
now infamous words: “The
average SAT for African
Americans is 750. Do we set
standards in the future so we
don’t admit anybody with the
national test? Or do we deal
with a disadvantaged popula-
tion that doesn’t have the
genetic, hereditary background
to have a higher average?” Of
course, upon hearing of his
remarks many minority stu-
dents accused him of being a
“racist.” What is ironic about
this is that Lawrence is one of
the left-wing radicals who has
long advocated legislated
racial quotas such as affirma-
tive action. But now he is
being turned on by those
whom he sought to help just
because he mentioned the fact
that blacks score, on average,
lower than other groups such
as whites and Asians.

This incident just proves my
point that affirmative action
has so balkanized America
along racial line_s that “politi-
cally correct” blacks and
Hispanics will never allow
white males, no matter how
liberal, to be a member of their
group. This sort of groupism
and, interestingly, self-
imposed segregation clearly
demonstrates that the “multi-
culturalism” and “political cor-
rectness” on college campuses
today is not in reality about

coverage.»

inclusion, but is about exclu-
sion.

As for the future of
Lawrence, he helped to create
this politically correct, racist
world which has engulfed our
college campuses and should
pay accordingly for it. He is
now seen as just another
“white-oppressor male.” I have
no sympathy for him, for it is
white, preppy liberals like him
that help to perpetuate the
stereotype of all white males
being racist, . sexist
Neanderthals. Have a nice
retirement Lawrence.

The second case that is
going to ensure that affirma-
tive action remains a key issue
of politicians, columnists and
the public is Ca1ifomia’s Civil
Rights Initiative, which will
likely be on the ballot in 1996.‘
This state constitutional
amendment will be voted on in
a referendum and the early
predictions are that it will pass.
The main part of the amend-
ment states that public agen-
cies will be prohibited from
using “race, sex, color, ethnici-
ty, or national origin as a crite-
rion for either discriminating
against, or granting preferen-
tial treatment to, any individ-
ual or group in the operation of
the state’s system of public
employment, public education,
or publicécontracting.” This
just sounds like common sense
to me or anyone else who sup-
ports the 1964 Civil Rights
Act.

Not only do I think that the
California initiative will pass,
but I also think that many
states will follow their lead.
Much to the chagrin of the rad-
ical Left, issues such as affir-
mative action are not only a
movement by “angry white
males” as is being portrayed in
mainstreammedia, but is a
grassroots effort to return to
the American work ethic
which rewards people for their
hard work and sacrifices.
Being bom with dark skin or
with breasts simply doesn’t
qualify. ' e

j nist for The Pitt News.

In the ﬁnal analysis there are
three types of people/groups
who support affirmative
action: a) those that have a
vested interest in perpetuating
the “victimization” of blacks
such as Jesse Jackson and the
NAACP; b) those that think
blacks and Hispanics are
genetically inferior to whites
and Asians. It is interesting
that the very same liberals who
accuse Charles Murray of
being a racist because of his
book, “The Bell Curve”, are
staunch supporters of affirma-
tive action. This is not only
ironic, but hypocritical as well
since, at least in education,
affirmative action was clearly
founded on the belief that cer-
tain minorities need to be
given lower qualifying stan-
dards than whites or Asians to
enter university. Then there is
c) —- those who advocate
reverse discrimination to “get
even” for what happened in
the past.

I certainly count myself
among those who denounce
the atrocities of the slave trade,
but there are several things
that need to be pointed out.
First is the indisputable fact
that Africans sold their fellow
brothers and sisters into slav-
ery, but I don’t hear that part
of the story being told.
Secondly, it is absurd to expect
the present generation to suffer
for things that happened gener-
ations ago. lt’s not going to
work. The people who are liv-
ing today were never slaves
and they are entitled to no

more rights or privileges than i

the rest of us.

Until America is a color and
gender blind society we will
never have racial harmony. For
this to happen, affirmative
action must be abolished. The
government should ensure
equal opportunity, not equal

outcome, otherwise they are i

just legislating a new and dif-
ferent form of racism.

Lewis was

on_e_in a
million

Columnist very
Tom _ now
, Schneider and

again.-—— and

it doesn’t happen too often
— someone comes around
who can enrichother lives
simply by taking part in
them.

Someone who makes us
forget everything we’ve ever
learned about the cruel‘
harshness of society and the
overwhelming selfishness of
its inhabitants. Bobby Lewis
was one such person.

Lewis was involved with
the University of Pittsburgh
in a number of capacities for
nearly 50 years, 36 of those
as Pitt’s head baseball
coach. He died in his home
on Feb. 22, not yet two
years after his official retire;
ment as Pitt’s assistant ath-
letic director.

What Lewis left behind
was the legacy of an illustri-
ous career during which he
taught all those he came in
contact with an unforget-
table lesson about honor,
morality and the true nature
of athletics. ‘

Bobby Lewis was the liv-
ing antithesis of the modern
day coach. Coaches who
will sacrifice anything --
players, family, friends, or
their integrity — for a win-
ning team. To Bobby Lewis,
these coaches were not win-
ners at all.

Not to say that he himself

‘ wouldn’t be found guilty of
being a little single-minded
in his approach to coaching.
Ask anyone who knew him
and they’ll tell you -— Lewis
dedicated his entire coach-
ing career to one thing -
his players.

Listening to Bobby Lewis
talk about the players he
coached over the span of his
career was like hearing a
proud father chronicling his
son’s latest accomplish-
ments. When reminiscing
about teams from the past,
Lewis rarely talked in terms
of runs, hits and errors. To
‘the contrary, the numbers he
spoke about more often were
those of grade point aver-
ages and graduation rates.

To Bobby Lewis, these
were the things that mat-
tered more than wins and
losses.

That doesn’t mean that
Lewis’ players 'and teams
didn’t find some consider-
able success on the field.
Two of his teams, in fact,
made it to the NCAA play-
offs (l959 and 1963), and in
1968, the Panthers finished
16-9 and received an invita-
tion to the Riverside (Calif.)

By Michael Kovak

The Pitt Lady Panthers
reached the semifinals of the
Big East tournament after
defeating St. John’s in the
opening round, 73-67, on
March 4 at Walsh Gymnasium
in Seton Hall. I

Pitt’s next opponents were
the unstoppable Lady Huskies
of Connecticut, who claimed
the Big East tournament
championship.

Pitt fell victim to Rebecca
Lobo and UConn for the third
time this season, 95-63, as did
all opponents who faced them.

“Connecticut is unquestion-

try,” head coach Kirk Bruce
said. “If they stay healthy, I
give them a 95 percent chance
of ‘winning it all.’’ *

Pitt finished their season
with a 17-11 record, but failed’
to make the NCAA or the NIT
postseason tournaments.

“It was betw_een us,
Villanova and Massachusetts,”
Bruce said on missing the
NIT. “The team wasn’t all that
disappointed by not making
the NIT.” ‘ ‘

Before their prelude with
Connecticut, the Lady
Panthers never trailed in their
opening round match up
against St. John’s.

After a 2-2 tie to start the
game, Pitt went on a 9-2 run
to open up a 13-4 lead. Pitt’s
largest lead of the first half
came with 1:35 left when cen-

ably the best team in the coun- _

Shallow Grave

Directed by Danny Boyle

With Kerry Fox, Christopher Eccleston
and Ewan McGregor

Because few moviegoers can actu-
ally identify with the narratives of, say,
Psycho, Blood Simple or Vertigo (and
those who can relate would most likely
rather eat Danny Boyle than watch his
film), for a psycho-drama to really work
the plot-point punches have to roll
bang-bang quick or else we’ll all
scratch our heads and question the
script, “Would that really happen?”
Unless, of course, a character is marig-
inalized and made crazy, then anything
goes. With no loonies then, Shallow
Grave relies on John Hodge’s vertigi-
nous, yet tight, narrative to tell a dark
story of death, psycho-paranoia and
dementia. As if it were the Coen broth-
ers working on a Hitchcock script,
Boyle's film incorporates both realism
and surrealism into one coherent, ten-
sion-driven whole that stretches bound-

aries with enough restraint to make the,

improbable seem plausible.

Shallow Grave begins with three flat-
mates Alex (Ewan McGregor), David
(Christopher Eccleston) and Juliet
(Kerry Fox), who are of the more cul-
tured-than-thou_ hyper-professional
sort, in search of a fourth roommate.
After turning down several potentials,
the three decide on Hugo —- a shady
yet interesting sophisticate. When they
discover Hugo dead and his suitcase
full of money (a narrative gimmick
which propels’ the rest of the story), the
three decide to keep the money and

bury Hugo — but are soon caught in a .

web of backstabbing, murder, inspec-
tors, thugs and their own psycho-para-
noia. When the three draw straws to
determine who should cut the hands

and feet off Hugo (so the body can’t be
identified), and the stodgy lawyer David
loses, the film is at its most Dahmer-ish
as we watch him saw and saw away at
raw bone.

Although primarily a plot-driven film,
Shallow Grave is fairly atmospheric
and moody with its focus on only these
three characters, their decisions and
the careful color scheme of the flat (ice-
blue, green, yellow and black). With
high contrasts in lighting, se|f-con-
scious camerawork (lots of kinetic
zooms, acute low and high angles),
expressionistic props and long-shots

A scene from Danny Boyle's paranoid psycho-thriller Shallo Grave.

that dwarf the three in their flat,
Shallow Grave is a highly watchable
piece of macabre filmmaking. Boyle
sprinkles the screen with all the accou-
terments of psycho-drama — the spi-
raling staircase, enormous spatial
dimensions, even a flashlight on
David’s face from below — to give the
film its highly stylized ambience.
Without taking the easy way out, and
allowing an external character to clean
up the mess the script creates, Shallow
Grave allows its three characters to
resolve their conflicts without the help
of the inspectors who have caught onto

their scheme. It's a good thing the

script was written that way‘, too, «A 

because such a carefully woven story
would be ruined with a cop-out ending.
Instead, we’re in receipt of a smart,
well-told story that that will fall nicely
into a Hitchcock, Coen brothers tradi-
tion. ‘

Shallow Grave opened at The Flex
Theatre, South Side, last Friday and

will continue to run through March 30. ,

Showtimes are 7:30 and 9:30 daily,
with 2 and 4 pm matinees Sat. and
Sun. Call 381-2200.

Tales From Memphis

ﬁsesrgeﬁfl’ by Bob Pomeroy

One definition of rock and roll: “White red-
necks trying to play black music,” or so suggests
Robert Gordon in his new book It Came From
Memphis. (Faber: Faber, $23.95) Early rock and

roll was the product of racial and cultural collision, ’

blacks and whites sharing the same nightclubs and
recording studios, throwing off sparks while build-
ing a bridge between cultures. The sparks mani-
fested in music and exploded from a segregated
American South. Memphis was built on this kind of
collision and Memphis gave birth to the beast.
Gordon’s book, which he'll be in town to promote
at Borders Bookstore, Saturday, March 18 at 7:00,
focuses on an early generation of Memphis rock-
and-roll audience, a crowd who he calls the “wit-
nesses.” By gathering the stories of long-time
music industry renegade Jim Dickinson, the Mar-
Keys, and many more musician/luminaries, It
Came From Memphis sketches a digressive history
of lesser-known Memphis music. The witnesses
recall a racially and culturally liberated night life
across the river in the West Memphis clubs of the
late ‘50s. They came up listening to the sonic may-
hem of radio legend Dewey Phillips (who blew off
playlists and devised his own Top 10, spinning
blues, R&B and hillbilly music, on his program
“Red, Hot & Blue.”) Fortunate enough to drink
whiskey and play with bluesmen such as Furry
Lewis and Fred McDowell, this generation, for
Gordon, inherited Delta Blues and “codified rock
and roll culture.” They organized the famous
Memphis Delta Blues Festivals of the late ‘60s
when their own City Hall would not. The idea of

music as the means to tear a hole,
even if it’s a small one, in the fabric of
institutional racism, has_a tradition in
Memphis.

Pop culture is disposable culture,
tossing Nirvana CDs in the trash with
used burger wrappers in a perpetual
search for more novél-seeming goods.
The next big thing is always built on
diluted variations of deeper, more
enduring musical traditions. Corporate
record companies, in their efforts to
sell us as much standardized McPop
as we’ll swallow, won't touch the likes
of Furry Lewis or Big Star, and would
have you and me ignore the original
art that remains largely unrecognized
in shadow of their sales.

“Banned, Bootlegged, and Forgot” is -
the name that Gordon, also a docu-
mentary filmmaker (credited with the
award-winning film, All Day and All
Night,) gives to the video presentation
that accompanies his appearance this

5atUFdaY- The h0Ur-long Pmgram f9a'BIuesman Furry Lewis shows his colors in 1970. A

tures stepped-on video footage of

Dewey Phillips’ wild ‘50s TV show,The Pop Shop,
along with performances by Panther Burns, some
“blues oddities” and the Cramps. Gordon said he
hopes the affair will be interactive, drawing
response from the audience to the music and per-

sonalities appearing in pixel-vision. Picture the

response that the image of Lux Interior, doing his

thing while a news anchorman plugs a band called _

the Klitz, might provoke in the swank surroundings
of Borders Bookstore.

Gordon's visit comes Saturday, March 18, 7 in
the p.m. at Border's Books in the South Hills and
it's fer free.

What the hell is up with the
indie rock community these
days? Who knows. Royal Trux
went major. Guided By
Voices released a box set of
out-o-print records from the
‘80s and got a four-star review
for their new LP, Alien Lanes ,
in Flolling Stone (it would have
been five if Butch Vig would

have produced it).
Indie rock is huge.
Its stars are flying
their colors in
Entertainment Weekly.
Jeepers! With just a touch of
e|itism(sic), |et’s look at some
recent seven-inch singles that
feature bands not in super-
market periodicals.

A fast-growing favorite of
PTS disk jockeys is Blonde
RedHead’s new offering. The
single “10 feet high” b/w
“VaIentine” is offered by the

fine folks at Smells Like
Records and it melts my heart.
A single word sums up this
record: sexy. Weather she
whispers, croons or screams,
Kazu makes yr blood boil. This
single will make you forget any
weak Kim Gordon comparison.
Her favorite musicians/singers
range from Billie Holliday to
the Palace Brothers, and Kazu
has listened and learned a few
tricks. The band as a whole
delivers well-phrased, dynamic
music that is equally mysteri-
ous and rockin’. The B side is
a loose, dreamy acoustic look
at love, or something.

If l’ve heard anything about
the band 18th Dye it’s that
they grow on you. I've heard
comments like “I didn't like
them at first, but now...” quite
frequently at the radio station. I
dare say that their latest single
demands an immediate opin-
ion from the listener after the
first listen. Whoahhl The sin-
gle, “PIay w/You” b/w “Gout

S.F” and “F” is a hot platterll
O.K. the buzz: Steve Albini
produced the A sidell I openly
admit I’m skeptical when I hear
that phrase, but the man has a
knack for tight, precise recod-
ing technics and a killer drum
sound. It works well here
because 18th Dye has a styl-
ishly intense drummer. To
some, the song “Play w/You”
sounds broken. I can sympa-
thize with this interpretation.
However, what you may hear
is a snarling bass/drum groove
and vocals interrupted by gui-
tar skronk, then presto: one
hell of a chorus. In fact, I’m
humming it right now. It is by
far the most intense song in
their catalog. Not to downsize
the B side, it’s good too. “Gout
S.F” and “F” remind me slightly
of the Pixies, and are very
palatable for all. Quirky pop
with a noisy tendency...Yum.
This brings me to the latest
Karl Hendricks Trio single,
“Coming in September.”

  

Sometimes I think this is one
of the finest Karl songs period.
This Peas Kor release rivals
the “Baseball cards" 7”, a killer
Mind Cure effort. Oh, maybe
I’m getting too worked up, but
damn if this doesn't rock with a
capital  Who can resist
uptempo guitar crunch met
with a tight groove and power
vocals? I dare you not to tap yr
toe. Like the 18th Dye single, I
am most impressed with the A
side. “They May be Paper" is
good, don’t get me wrong, but
“Coming in September’ reigns
supreme. With “A Gesture of
Kindness,” the new full-length
on Fiasco, it is no wonder the
KHT is courted by Merge and
music lovers nation wide.

Oh, you don’t want to miss
the new Hurl 7”. Word’s out
that it’s good and avaiable for
purchase at fine record stores,
like Paul's. While you’re at it,
check out the latest from
The(e) Speaking Canaries.

The Pitt News, Thursday, March 16, 1995

Tournament. -

When you talked to Bobby
Lewis about that ‘68 team,
however, he would speak
more fondly about their 3.25
team grade point average. He
would also be quick to point
out there were three dentists,
three doctors, six engineers
and an ordained minister on
that squad.

George “Doc” Medich, a
pitcher at Pitt during the late
1960s, had a solid major
league career with the New
York Yankees, Pittsburgh
Pirates and Texas Rangers.

Mention Medich’s name to
Lewis, though, and Lewis
talked about how “Doc” put
himself through medical
school while playing profes-
sional baseball.

Not only did Lewis take
enormous pride in the suc-
cess of his players, but he

- openly spoke of his affection

   
 

and respect for the University
of Pittsburgh. Pitt was his
home, and he did everything
in his power to protect its
integrity.

Such loyalty for a coach to
any institution nowadays is
so rare, it is almost nonexis-
tent. All this did was add to
his legacy. _

Just days before his retire-
ment, Lewis summed up his
career with a single descrip-
tive sentence.

“I will leave Pitt, but Pitt
will never leave me.”

He didn’t fool anyone with
that statement. Bobby Lewis
will never leave Pitt. In the
minds of the many people he
touched, and in the heart of
the University of Pittsburgh,
the spirit of Bobby Lewis
will live forever.

tant sports editor of The Pitt
News.
