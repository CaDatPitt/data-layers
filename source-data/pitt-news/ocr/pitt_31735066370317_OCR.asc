Students to utilize
new supercomputer

By David Zafris

I Staff Writer

Pitt students may get hands—on ex-
perience with the new Cray X—MP/48
supercomputer soon after it is opera-
tional this spring. according to Pitt
physics Professor Ralph Roskies.

Roskies said that students in upper-
level physics. engineering and applied
mathematics probably will be using the
supercomputer for class assignments.

"Instead of putting problems up on
the blackboard. the professors may
soon be able to assign problems directly
on the Cray X—MP/48." Roskies said.

Students will be able to plug into the
Cray X—MP/48 supercomputer from
Pitt's existing computer terminal
system.

One advantage to using the super-
computer is that it can perform several
calculations at one time. Conventional
computers. in contrast. can only per-

_ form one calculation at a time. At peak

operating speeds.'Pitt‘s new supercom-
puter will be able to perform 840
million calculations per second, ac-
cording to Roskies, the project's co-
principal investigator.

Other universities in the supercom-
puter system include Cornell Univer-
sity. Princeton University, the Univer-
sity of Illinois and the University of
California at San Diego.

The Cray X—MP/48 is the most
powerful machine of its kind. It has
four processors and eight million words
of memory. The Cray X-MP/48 also
will be equipped with a 128 million
word solid—state storage device.

than ones at the other schools is
because it can process more
information.

"It’s bigger." said Roskies. "Some
supercomputers have only two proces-
sors where we have four. some can on-
ly handle four million words in
memory and we can handle eight
million. No supercomputer that can do
all this is also equipped with storage
device.“

It was announced in mid—January that
Pittsburgh would get the supercom-
puter system. The National Science
Foundation gave a grant of nearly $40
million to the Mellon—Pitt—Carnegie
Corporation. a partnership between Pitt
and Carnegie—Mellon University to
establish a national supercomputing
center in Pittsburgh.

In the agreement. the two schools
will receive the $22 million Cray X-
MP/48 supercomputer and other
related equipment. Total value of the
project is estimated at over $70 million.

Pitt President Wesley Posvar said
that the supercomputer should greatly
enhance Pittsburgh‘s reputation as a
scientific research center.

“It will help us attract top scientific
talent to the area, and will also serve
as a magnet for attracting new high-
technology businesses and industries to
the Pittsburgh area," Posvar said.

- The supercomputer also will allow
advanced research to be conducted in
new drug-design, protein analysis and
analysis of complex biological
chemical systems.

The Cray X—MP/48 will even fit in-
to Pitt’s curriculum. “There‘s already

MONDAY, FEBRUARY 10, [986

By Michael Ashford

Assistant News Editor

There is no doubt that Gary Hart
wants to bring new ideas into
democratic party politics, if only
because the word is the leitmotif of
every public address he gives. And
judging by the results of Mondale’s
attempt at the presidency in ’84. he
has certainly hit the mark in diag-
nosing the party’s main illness as a
dearth of novel approaches to the
modern economic problems facing

   

A e Hart’s ideas really so new?

America today.

In the final analysis, however,
Hart’s program is perhaps only
novel in its blending of conservative
and liberal notions of how govern-
ment and the economy should
interact.

I-Iart calls his program “growth
economics,” in fact a catch—phrase
of new republican conservatives.
And Hart admitted this when he in-
directly chastised his party col-
leagues for their declamations over
the need to redistribute wealth, that
which was “subsumed under the

Dave Hooker/The Pitt News

 

word “fairness” in ’84, and said
“the best way to redistribute wealth
is to increase wealth by causing
economic growth and opportuni-

ty.”

To that he added. “Only a grow-
ing economy can generate the
revenue to support a humane public
agenda.”

It all sounds too familiar — the
fundamental idea, Reaganomics
and its "unfettered” market expan-
sion with mystical revenue
kickbacks.

Fund created to honor shuttle Victim

WASHINGTON, D.C. — The Na-
tional Education Association honored
one of its own last week by setting up
an education fund for teachers in
memory of Christa McAuliffe. the
37-year-old social studies teacher and
NEA member who perished with six
other astronauts in the space shuttle
Challenger at Cape Canaveral Tues-
day, Jan. 28. I

“Christa McAuliffe was the epitome
of professionalism in teaching,” said
NEA President Mary Hatwood Futrell
in announcing the establishment ofthe

Christa McAuliffe American Education
Fund. "It was her desire to inspire and

challenge America's children that is her‘

legacy to us."

Futrell said that grants from the fund
would be available to both aspiring and
practicing teachers.

Just a few days before boardingithe
ill-fated space shuttle, McAuliffe told
reporters how she hoped her ﬂight —
and the lessons she planned to teach to
the nation’s classrooms from space —
would “elevate the teaching profes-

99

S1011.

“I-Iopefully." McAuliffe said,
“students are going to be looking at me
and perhaps think of going into teach-
ing as a profession."

In the spirit of Christa‘s own
teaching philosophy. grants from the
Christa McAuliffe American Education
Fund will be awarded to enable teach-
ers to “explore” their subject fields in
new and innovative ways, said Futrell.

Examples of these challenging and
pioneering teaching initiatives would

Federal court shoots down Gramm—Rudman go““" ‘Q,

WASHINGTON — A federal court
in Washington shot down the Gramm-
Rudman balanced budget law on Fri-
day, a law which would balance the
budget by the year 1991. The court said
the law’s key provision violates the
Constitution's separation of powers
doctrine. The law requires automatic
spending cuts if Congress and the presi-
dent fail to meet annual deficit-
reduction targets, but the special three-
judge panel said the act is unconstitu-
tional because it gives the legislative
branch the power to enforce its own
law through the Comptroller General
— the nation’s top auditor. The court
said the Comptroller General is a
legislative officer because Congress
can remove him from his post and the
constitution gives the power to execute
the law to the executive branch
exclusively.

The ruling is being appealed to the
Supreme Court, and the legislation will
remain in effect until a ruling by the
high court is announced. This year’s
cut under the law is scheduled to take
place on March 1. The government an-
nounced last month the cut would be
$11.7 billion.

Reagan looks
toward allies.

WASHINGTON — President
Reagan wants to know what European
and Asian allies think about the ten-
tative U.S. counter-offer to the Soviet

Union’s latest sweeping arms control
proposal. Officials revealed that
Reagan dispatched arms control pro-
posal. Officials revealed that Reagan
dispatched arms control advisors Paul
Nitze and Edward Rowny out to get the
allies’ views. Both men are expected
to return to Washington next week.

Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev an-
nounced the Soviet proposal last
month. It calls for a world free of
nuclear weapons by the year 2000.
Another proposal, which the United
States rejects was the United States’
pledging not to transfer missiles now
deployed in Europe to other countries.
The American counter-offer does not
go along with the proposal that Britain
and France agree not to increase their
arsenal. However, the counter offer ac-
cepts the calls of elimination of U.S.
and Soviet medium-range missiles from
Europe. Secretary of State Shultz said
this week he felt positive about Gor-
bachev’s arms control plan and called
the Soviet leader’s proposal in medium-
range missiles “interesting.”

Swap of spies
to take place

Germany — A West German
newspaper Welt am Sorzmag said three
West German businessmen arrested in
the Soviet Union last year in a
crackdown on corruption are on a plane
to West Germany. The newspaper said

their homecoming may be a kind of
“bonus” preceding the trade of 10 peo-
ple —— including Soviet Jewish dissident
Anatoly Shcharansky.

Reports said the swap of Eastern and
Western spies and dissidents will come
Tuesday, but a West German News
Agency (DPA) said one well—placed
West German source said it may come
earlier - to avoid becoming a media
“spectacle.” The West has never of-
ficially confirmed the agreement
sources said was worked out in several
months of negotiations by Moscow,
East and West Germany and
Washington.

Haiti president
ﬂees to Alps

Haiti — Jean-Claude Duvalier was
officially Haiti’s president-for—life
before he ﬂed the Caribbean country
Friday after months of violent protests.
He is now staying at a heavily guard-
ed hotel in the French Alps. He refused

to comment when he and his entourage

arrived in Grenoble, France, on a U.S.
Air Force jet. French ofﬁcials say he’ll
be allowed to stay eight days before
leaving for asylum in another country.

A six-man rnilitary-civilian junta has
replaced Duvalier and ordered a curfew
to quell violent riots triggered by the
celebration after the dicator’s depar-
ture. Haitian opposition leaders said
they’re.happy Duvalier is gone, but
they’re worried the new government

Flight operations
to resume in Libya

WASHINGTON —— Pentagon of-
ficials said two U.S. aircraft carriers
are headed across the Mediterranean
sea toward Libya and that ﬂight opera-
tions off the Libyan coast will probably
resume. The officials said the Carrier
Coral Sea left Naples and the Saratoga
left Trieste, Italy on Saturday — a few
days earlier than their scheduled Mon-
day departure dates.

The officials said the sixth ﬂeet may
announce during the weekend its intent
to ﬂy again in the Gulf of Sidra area.
Libyan leader Moammar Khadafy has
threatened to attack Israeli civilian
airliners, but the Pentagon officers said
the ships’ deployment is not related to
Khadafy’s threat.

Low oil prices
may cause problems

The head of the American Petroleum
Institute, Charles DiBona, said falling
oil prices may make the United States
dependant on imported oil again.
DiBona said low prices and plentiful

supplies could encourage buying of *1‘?

bigger cars and discourage conserva-
tion. Oil exploration will be less pro-
fitable. DiBona agreed with short-run
predictions that falling prices will
stimulate the economy.

Couple married
for 81 years

Valentine's Day is less than a week
away and here is a recipe for romance
from a couple who has been married
for 81 years. Oliver and Cora Lee
Glenn of Elmore. Alabama, said it’s
easy — just love each other and try to
be pleasing and satisfying.”

The Glenns are both 99-years old and
were honored yesterday at Elmore”s
Merry Wood Nursing Home as the
longest—married couple in the United
States. Oliver said he and Cora Lee
“never did have any fusses or quarrels
and things like that.” He added, “If
you are with a woman you love, you
can stay 81 years and you won’t be
sorry. ’ The Glenn’s were found to be
the nation’s longest—married couple
after more than 25.000 names were
submitted to the organization
Worldwide Marriage Encounters.

Sakharov accused
of being criminal

MOSCOW — The official Soviet
news agency TASS has published
remarks by Soviet leader Mikhail Gor-
bachev that accuse dissident scientist
Andrei Sakharov of criminal actions.
It’s the first time Gorbachev has made
the accusations about the dissident,
who lives in internal exile. Gorbachev
also said Sakharov will never leave the
Soviet Union because he knows state
secrets.

Shuttle to ﬂy
in six months

WASHINGTON — The Washington
Post quotes a Pentagon official as
predicting the space shuttle will be ﬂy-
ing again “in six months”. Defense
department sources told the newspaper

that NASA is close to pinpointing the
cause of the explosion of the
Challenger. The same report said the
Air Force is going ahead with prepara-
tions for the first space shuttle launch
from Vandenburg Air Force Base in
California this July.

Plane lands
in El Salvador

El Salvador — A plane coming from
the United States was forced to make
an emergency landing on El Salvador’s
Pacific coast, and nearby residents
report seeing packages containing
camouﬂage uniforms. backpacks and
military belts thrown out before the
plane landed. Dozens of soldiers sealed
off the area. The Salvadoran military
said the craft was carrying an engine
and spare parts for the Salvadoran air
force, but a recent report said U.S.—
backed Nicaraguan rebels are using
Salvadoran facilities to get American
supplies to their troops.

Easter Island
mystery revealed

Easter Island — Norwegian scien-
tist/explorer Thor Heyerdahl said his
team has solved the mystery of how an-
cient peoples placed 20—ton statues
about Easter Island. Heyerdahl said 20
men last week moved a statue forward
in steps, leaning the giant head to one
side and then to the other while pull-
ing the statue forward with ropes.

Heyerdahl said the experiment,
designed by a Czech mechanical
engineer, "solves the mystery of why
the Islanders said the statues walked."
The huge, expressionless 20-ton statues
are the main tourist attraction of Easter
Island, a Chilean possession in the

South Pacific, miles from the Chilean ‘

mainland.

Pitt to survey economy

The University of Pittsburgh has begun a survey of 400 families living
in the Duquense, Pa. area to determine their human service needs and
economic conditions four years after massive unemployment began in the

area.

The survey is being conducted by Pitt‘s School of Social Work under
the direction of Dean David Epperson. The survey’s principal investigator.
James V. Cunningham, said he hopes the results will improve employ-
ment programs and services available to Duquense families. Unemployed
persons from the area have been hired to do the phone interviews under
the supervision of the university’s Center for Social and Urban Research.

The survey has been endorsed by the Duquense Business Advisory Com-
mittee, a group of business people, clergy and government officials from
Duquesne. It also has the support of Mike Bilcsik, a long—term officer
of the steelworkers local at the Duquesne mill, who recently served as

the committee's president.

Bogus diet
found false

A peanut butter and hot dog diet
bearing the name of the Miami Heart
Institute is being passed around the
country by word of mouth. The in-
stitute, though. said it never backed any
such diet and never would.

The heart institute‘s chief clinical
dietitian, Cheryl Wahlstrom, said the
diet is high in cholesterol and could be
harmful to people with high blood
pressure or diabetes. The diet is also
lacking in several vitamins and
nutrients.

Copies of the diet claim it works
through “chemical breakdown" and
promise followers they will lose “up

to 40 lbs. in a month if [they] stick to
it." Users are instructed to follow the
diet for three days. then eat normally
for four days.

During the three days. a typical
breakfast consists of grapefruit. toast.
peanut butter and coffee or tea. A
typical dinner calls for two hot dogs.
broccoli, carrots. half a grapefruit and
half a cup of vanilla ice cream.

Aside from the risk. Wahlstrom said,
"It‘s just not a smart way to tackle a
problem like weight. If you at any point
resume the type of eating habits you
have always had, you regain the weight
you worked so hard to lose."

The institute has been unable to
determine where the diet originated.
It’s received letters and more than 200

phone calls from places as far from
Miami as Los Angeles and London,
England.

Libya threatens
Israeli airliners

Libya — Libyan leader Moaminar
Khadafy said he has ordered his air
force to intercept Israeli airliners and
force them to land if they are located
within range of Libyan bases. Khadafy
said he's looking for terrorists, a term
he uses to describe former Israeli Prime
Minister Menachcm Begin and current
cabinet minister Ariel Sharon. He said
the order is in response to Israel's in-
terception of a Libyan executive jet last
Tuesday.

Survival
Of The Fittest

Mr. Reagan has made known in no uncertain
terms that he is the sworn enemy of Big Govern-
ment. Decades of liberal social spending, he main-
tains, have weakened our proud nation. The nox-
ious inﬂuence of social spending has, according to
Reagan, been felt in many quarters. Social spend-
ing places an unfair burden on the honest American
taxpayer. It has imperiled the U.S. economy by
creating a massive, intractable national deficit.
Finally, and most worrisome to our defense—minded
president, social spending has threatened our na-
tional security by diverting precious finite funds
from our friends in the Pentagon.

. Reagan proclaims that he is selﬂessly devoted to
recapturing America’s lost grandeur — a noble no-
tion such as it is. But in the service of this admirable
aim, his priorities have become skewed. That this
is true is amply evident in Reagan’s perfunctory
assault on the national deficit. Reagan will brook
no cuts in the defense budget; no, on the contrary
he demands increased expenditures on the military
— massive increases. Further, the American tax-
payer has carried the burden of social spending long
enough — thus, taxes are slashed to benefit none
other than the afﬂuent. Ultimately, contends
Reagan, to keep our proud nation strong, villainous
social spending must swiftly be hacked by the
budget—cutting ax.

Reagan has chosen guns before butter — or,
perhaps, merely guns and no butter is more ac-
curate. Reagan’s Darwinian ruthlessness is as cold-
ly indifferent to human suffering and misery as is
nature itself. This inhumane disdain for the needy
and for the general welfare is more than distasteful
— it is intolerable.

Long Journey

This letter really is addressed to Dan
Bates from an old faculty member who
has completed, alas, most of the long
journey from childhood to retirement.

Perhaps we would all be much
healthier and happier if we ask
ourselves what we really want to be do-
ing in our adult years. Is it an automat-
ic “given" that we should get married.
have dogs and kids, wear neckties or
skirts, etc.? Perhaps we. should be
teaching courses in ﬁnding career
goals.

You've got to watch out for some
booby traps, however. Getting married
can be very dangerous, but having
children can be fatal if you place a
higher priority on enjoyment of work
than money. Kids are expensive. Very
expensive. Maybe a couple of hundred
thousand each. I'm not saying don't
have them. I have four who have been
absolutely wonderful. _.

But you should know that the deci-
sion to have children also may be the
decision to put on the dark suit and
wing—tipped shoes. Unless, of course,
you can make a bundle while having
fun at the same time.

Letters to the Editor —---———

Overzealous Fans

This is in response to your February
5 article about Pitt's mediocre season
and the comments about Doug West
(We$t). I realize that the Pitt communi-
ty may not like Doug We$t because of
the recruiting incident. but let's wait
until the courts decide who's telling the
truth before we start making insinua-
tions about Mr. West's integrity. While
I agree with the article in that Pitt has
some of the rowdiest fans in the coun-
try and I realize that harassing opposing
players is part of the game and fun for
the fans, I do not think it is the job of
this newspaper to advocate such
behavior. And then, when a fan gets
overly excited and throws a dime on
the court, everyone is wondering how
he became such a jerk. Did you ever
think that this “let's get together and
harass Doug West” mentality may be
the reason that Pitt is in the predica-
ment (4-5 in the Big East) that it's in?
There is more concentration on fan in-
volvement than there is on the game.
If you don't believe me, ask the fan
who yelled, “Look out Charles, there's
a dime" before a free throw against St.
John's. I don't think that this type of
fan involvement is what the NCAA and
the Big East Conference have in mind
when they sanction these games.

The Ritual Dissent/James M. Crary

Pension investorsusually don't
go in for industries planning drastic
changes. Stability is the key to suc-
cess in promoting investment.

How can one preserve the status
quo while instituting industrial
reform on a massive scale? Military
industries are so totally dependent
on government subsidies that they
dare not even deviate from the
monotonous and hypnotic sales
pitch about “the Soviet Menace"
anymore than the U.S.S.R. can af-
ford to deviate from the outdated
monotony of “Workers Unite and
Fight! " The entire arms race smells
of a few rats. But how can one
change the nature of the under-
taking without throwing a wrench
into the works?

The answer is to introduce pro-
duct reform. Tank assemblies can
be financed by government sub-
sidies but cannot alter the fun-
damental uselessness of tanks. ex-
cept. of course. for war. but war

Product Reform

is over. Blueprints must be de-
signed to transform tank assembly
to mobile homes. changing nothing
but the product. If nothing can be
found to do with the mobile homes
then they're no worse than tanks.
Maybe Argentina would like them.
or maybe Quebec. It's a better idea
than killingry.

The transformation of industry
from private to government control
dates into the Roosevelt era. Na-
tionalism and the war effort
prompted a takeover in industrial
circles by government planners.
When the war was over the govem—
ment had little imagination to turn
to peacetime industries, so they
perpetuated the Cold War, with
Soviet acquiescence who have their
own arms lobby to placate.

The fundamental assumption in
military justification for the arms
race is that power is an end in itself. '
The other assumption is that there
is not enough for everyone-. The lat-

ter assumption is false. There is
enough for everyone, but it isn't
distributed equitably. But isn't
distribution a socialist concept?
(Hiss!) Actually, fair distribution
would not effect the status quo, on-
ly unfair distribution does that.
What is fair distribution? Rural
electricity. sewage. information
systems. food surplus reallocation
and building systems are all neces-
sary ingredients of equitable dis-
tribution. This is not a fairy tale out
of Robin Hood. It's not a question
of making the poor rich. too.
Inappropriate industries are not
here to stay. Most of the justifica-
tions for the cold war mentality are
stale bread. The inventive spirit of
America has been stagnated into a
cesspool of bureaucratic inertia. As
a Pittsburgher, I resent watching
local industries collapse under the
jackboot of some hotshots from
Washington whose policies stink

like the Kremlin.

Blown Chunks And Blown Minds At The Upstage

I am preparing to engulf? myself
within the most stupidity and decadence
this city and chemistry have to offer —
a blotter of hi—potency LSD with
Oakland‘s own Upstage Lounge on
New Wave Night as the backdrop.

I dropped the tab a half hour ago and
I‘m feeling nice. It hasn’t kicked in yet
but the three—for-a—dollar drafts are
working their magic oblivion on my
already over-stimulated senses. It’s ear-
ly still and the hordes of pretty boys
and girls haven't really amassed under
the phallic disco rods yet.

A wailing Siouxsie and the Banshees
dirge comes on and my synapses snap

and crackle, ready to pop at the

slightest provocation. “Ohh ohh woh.
ohh ohh woh, ohh ohh woh,” she cries
as the electronic synare drumcrashes
at a mechanically specified time.
“Ohh, ohh, woh." My spine jerks as
someone spills a beer in my lap. “O_hh

ooh woh." I scream and the brain cells
begin to coagulate.

Paisley people in purple bow ties and
Chartreuse-colored hair glare at me
from their fashion cubicles. I see a
regular. a girl. thrusting her hips sug-
gestively. revealing. but only tome. a
leather slip and paisley panties. I make
my way over to her but large. gaunt
lethargic boys stop me cold with their
semen—encrusted eyes. Boy George and
Steven Morissey lookalikes every-
where. celebrating cheap beer Mon-
days among their own.

I retreat back to my table overlook-
ing the morass of contorting boys and
girls. The image of Archie and
Veronica doing the Flum Flu comes to
mind and reifies itself on the floor.
"Look! It’s Jughead!" I scream. “Go
man go. Look at him shimmy." I hear
Pebbles cry out, “Acck acck a dak 
We‘re goin’ way out, way out. that‘s

where the fun is. Way out. way out. "
It’s the alien Michelin men from the
Flinstones. “Kids. I‘m gonna make
you stars." Fred bellows. Epiphany:
The spinning disco ball above the dance
floor is powered by narcissistic energy.

The death darlings in black with
white lipstick all seem to amble
towards me at once, telling me things
I don‘t want to hear. but it‘s such a
short way from the bottom of their
skirts to the start of their loins.

I hear fragments from familiar songs.
droning like tape loops in a head shred
by shards of relentless propaganda.
“Hey. hey. hey. hey. Won‘t you come
see about me  " Snap goes the synare
at a mechanically specified time. Snap
bis boom ba  one of these days.
Alice. one of these days 

A familiar sensation tugs at my

' genitalia so I put my shoulder down to

carve a human path to the bathroom.

Somewhere West Of Venus/Pat McCray

It's packed. but no one's using the
toilets. They're all in front ofthe mir-
rors preening. priming. straightening
and smoldering with rancid lines.
aching gonads and images of the yard-
high stack of empty beer cups on their
tables. pushing them. prodding them.
I retreat to the stall and wipe the crushed
worms from my arms as a familiar
keyboard riff wafts between my legs.
I snap to as a synare goes pop at a
mechnically specified time. Girls with
big hair pass me as I exit the john and
their perfume. Eau de Danceﬂoor. ﬁlls
my nostrils with its pungently teasing
smell of wait! Look! Two boys lift
their fingers to their eyeshadow. look
at the jet—black smears and press them
together solemnly. Blood brothers?
Makeup friends? Disposable rituals
everywhere. like music videos. Snap
goes the synare at a mechanically
specified time. '
“Dancing with myself. dancing with

myself." blares the music as shuffling
images in the mirrors ‘look back at
solitary ﬁgures on the dance floor. A
dancing queen slips and falls on some
spilled beer and gets sucked into the
floor. No one looks. The song isn‘t
over.

There's sex in the air. on the floor
and walls. but the whole ambicnce is
oddly asexual; a dialectic of the passive
and active masquerading as a synthesis
in leather pants and green lipstick.
Fiendish stares. Dangerous glares.
They know! They know! Thejig is up!
The cover of my acid/disco ironic jux-
taposition is blown. They all start in on
me. like Romero's zombies with a ﬂair
for tawdry dress. I scramble among the
semi—human pylons like a walking dead
slalomist. dashing down the steps as the
sounds behind me get thin and mud-
dled. Crack went the synare at a
mechanically specified time.

Halley’s What?

Tuesday, Jan. 28, 1986. America
witnessed a tragedy comparable to
Pearl Harbor or the assassination of

I, /John F. Kennedy. The explosion of the
space

shuttle Challenger was
devastating in many ways. Of course,
there was the irreplaceable loss of men,
women and machinery. The space pro-
gram will suffer criticism and setbacks.
But what struck me most was that on
Tuesday. America lost a symbol.
While a college student may not iden-
tify. many others remember a time
when space travel existed only in the
minds ofdreamers and scientists. For
a respected nation. the orange and
yellow fireball in the Florida sky was
a symbol of lost pride and dreams. In
any case. what interested me as I watched
the news specials. wrap~k1ps. analyses.
exposes. etc.. was the media coverage

of this event. We were afforded the op-
portunity to witness the worst of
America’s journalists.

President Reagan, at a gathering in
Houston for the deceased, said that
America as a whole on Tuesday “con-
ducted a vigil by our television sets.”
The numbers speak for themselves.
The three major TV networks broad-
cast five—and-a-half hours of uninter-
rupted coverage Tuesday afternoon.
This was done at a loss of $9 million
to the companies. On an average
January afternoon. 34 million
American sets are on. On Jan. 28. this

jumped to 55 million. The TV’ in the

living room was a gathering place for
the family and the country.

All of this. I‘m sure. produced
tremendous stress on the cameramen.
directors and anchormen involved.

Maybe five hours is a long time to look
composed and informed. Maybe Peter
Jennings could have used a coffee
break. But then that is thejob of these
professionals. On Tuesday, America’s
television media performed just a bit
tastelessly.

Every TV announcer had little shut-
tle models. My favorite was Dan
Rather’s, as he held it aloft trying to
re—create the incident. We had
diagrams. animation and interviews of
anyone even remotely related to the
launch. MTV even cancelled its hi—tech
space shuttle station identification
message! Seriously. though, last Tues-
day is a day that will live forever in
sensationalism.

Unfortunately. as a result of all this
hype. those most affected by the
catastrophe had their privacy virtually

stripped. Spouses had mikes thrust in
their faces and were asked, “How do
you feel?" Boy, creative journalism at

,_its best. The grief of Christa

McAuliffe’s family was exposed for
public inspection. And do we really
need to be reminded 50 times of the
trauma her fonner students are feeling?

While I’m on the subject, the exten-
sive media coverage McAuliffe re-
ceived disturbed me. Before you all
damn my name or start mailing letter
bombs to my place. let me finish. I‘m
aware that she was to be the first
teacher. the first private citizen. in
space. I know she was married and had
two kids. But six other people died.
too. Six other people with six other
families. And these six werejust as. if
not more. valuable to NASA. They
were pilots. engineers and technicians

rolled into one. They were astronauts.
and NASA spent plenty training them.
Their loss and that ofla $1.5 billion
piece of machinery is not to be
overlooked.

Yeah. I know it’s been said a whole .

lot of times. but give me a turn, too.
I wish to express my sympathy and.
more importantly. my hope that
NASA's explorations will continue.
The crew of the Challenger devoted
their lives to this and it would bea
shame to give up on what they worked
and died for.

Keeping An Open Mind/Anthony Rosati
An Alternative Solution For South Africa

In the spirit of open—mindedness, let
me propose something that just might
scare the living hell out of you: I think
the best and only thing the United
States can do to alleviate the trouble in
South Africa is to threaten invasion.
Yup, that‘s right, friends -— we should
clearly state to the current government
of South Africa that unless apartheid
is totally eradicated from their socie-
ty, America will step in to do so itself.
Now before you all howl “facist“ or
“conservative. war-mongering right-
winger." let me present to you why I
feel it is the only effective thing we can
do to stop apartheid.

To beginvwith. in today’s- world.
America has no real strength in inter-
national affairs outside of military en-
forcement of its positions. One need
only look at the recent rash of embar-
rassments we have suffered trying to
persuade our allies in economically
boycotting Russia. Libya and South
Africa. To say the least, our "friends“
are in no way inclined to get involved
in our disputes if it means hurting their
“livelihood." This isn't because
Europe is overly cocky or "feeling its
oats"; it‘s just because no nation out-
side ofAmerica and the Soviet Union
is that economically stable to go along
with such measures. In the past it may
have been the thing to do, but with the
very tenuous balance with which our
economic world maintains itself. a
leader ofa European or Asian “ally"

state would have to be mad to risk-
everythingjust to keep 01‘ Uncle Ron-
ny happy. .

But there is an even more important
reason economic sanctions and
pressures won‘t change South Africa‘s
policy of apartheid; there is no way on
God’s green earth that Afrikaaners are
going to turn over the government to
people they fear above everyone else.
That's right, ladies and gents. the white
folk of South Africa are scared silly
whenever the mention of giving the
blacks control comes up — at least.
those whites who control the country
get scared silly: and those are the very
people we must "get at" if there is any
hope of bringing freedom to South
Africa's black people.

Why are they scared? Well, if you
look at the history of South,Africa. you
just might see why. First of all, the
Afrikaaners are_fore1‘gner.s' who, many
decades ago, forced the native blacks
offtheir land. Indeed. England fought.
I believe, at least three wars to keep
South Africa a sovereign and royal col-
ony. Millions of blacks have needlessly
died to keep a small, prejudiced
minority “in control." And it wasn‘t
only the blacks who suffered from this
prejudice and hatred — Indians. Arabs
and many other minorities who lived
in South Africa felt the sting of
Afrikaaner rule; even the great Mahat-
ma Ghandi suffered at the hands of
South African “leadership." As it

stands now. no land-owning or in-
dustrial Afrikaaner would even think
about relinquishing control —— he
“knows" that the first thing that will
happen to him and his family is. at
least, enslavement at the hands of the

blacks. or, at most, death. Put yourself

in their shoes —— ifyour family and life
were “in danger“ from a similar
group, would you relinquish your hold
of the means of control‘? Hardly not.
I think.

Now don't start with that old argu-
ment. “If~America can liberate the
blacks peacefully. then so can South
Africa." That’s a bunch of bull! Let‘s
look at the "similarities” between the
two situations. First of all, America did
/zoi colonize a land already settled with
native blacks: blacks were cruelly
enslaved by white men and brought to
America against their will. In South
Africa, we have Afrikaaners. descen-
dants of a group of English colonists
who, apparently, were ruthless in their
attempts to subdue and “control" an
immense population of native blacks.
Second. the enslaved blacks in America
constituted a minority of the popula-
tion, while in South Africa, native
blacks outnumber white Afrikaaners by
a ratio so ridiculously high, it’s almost
funny! Third, when enslaved blacks
wanted their freedom. they didn’t have
a homeland to take back from the
whites. so their efforts demmidezl
peace; but in South Africa, the blacks

were violently thrown out of their
homeland. restricted to what could only
be described as “reservations” and
slowly. continuously. degraded to no
end — violent overthrow has inevitably
become the only recourse the South
African black has to regain his home
and his dignity. Now then. can we real-
ly make comparisons‘? Indeed not, for
that would be foolish. The white
Afrikaaners would rather massacre
millions of blacks than lose the tenuous
control they have; the blacks would
rather murder every white man in
South Africa than submit to the
relentless humiliation of pride and
dignity heretofore endured. The result
is very clear: nothing we have done so
far will prevent a bloody and horrify-
ing civil war from breaking out. The
only outcome will be the countless
graves of both black and white human
beings.

So how can an American invasion
stop not just civil war but also apart-
heid‘? Well. there are two primary
reasons. First. it will take away the fear
and hatred between Afrikaaners and
native blacks. Remember, the blacks
hate Afrikaaners, because they Control
everything of importance in South
Africa, while the Afrikaaners fear the
blacks because they would gain control
of South Africa. By invading, we
eliminate the common denominator —
control. By maintaining control
ourselves, we could begin the first real

steps of honest "democratic—like"
government in South Africa. In order
to gain back their country, they would
have to work together, both starting
from nothing. and neither worried
about who would have to lose face or
security in the process. In addition,
they would have a common “enemy,“
the Americans; ‘and nothing so heals the
wounds ofcivil discontent than a com-
mon enemy.

Second, by going in ourselves, we
eliminate a temptation for the Russians
from appearing. Yeah, I know:
“Sounds like the kid here is a bit
paranoid!“ Go ahead and think that if
you will, but remember there hasn‘t
been a revolution yet that the Russians
haven’t “stuck their fingers in“ even
a little bit. It would be the greatest of
joys for them to eliminate one of the
strongest “citadels" of capitalism in
the African continent ~— one that. in-
cidentally, happens to “control"
(either directly of indirectly) the entire
lower half of Africa! Certainly. they
would have ample reason to step in
when massive civil war breaks out;
they would be helping their “poor. op-
pressed black brothers in destroying the
imperialist, slave—driving capitalists
from the Africah continent." Now.
how would you feel about that?

Sure. these are some very poignant
and, from my point of view. good
reasons for contemplating an invasion
of South Africa. I realize that I have
implied neither that the blacks nor the
Afrikaaners can settle their “domestic"
problem by themselves; I think that is
true. When you are so afraid of the op-
posite side that your only overriding
concern is for your “safety and well-
being,‘.’ can you truly and honestly
bargain for peace and cooperation?

I am aware that committing America
to such a task leaves her open to serious
“attack" from her allies and her
enemies. But, if we can be so con-
cerned with the freedoms of other peo-
ple, shouldn’t we be willing to back up
those convictions any way we know
how, if it prevents the needless deaths
of thousands, perhaps millions, of peo-
ple? I think so.

I realize that I have enraged many
people with the above statement. I can
only offer this apology — if the world
was fair andjust, we wouldn’t need to
set things right over and over again.
Being human, we must consider things
that can be downright distasteful . ’Even
though I abhor the thought of invasion
of another country by our own, it may
just be the one action that keeps
millions of people from suffering a
senseless death. or worse yet. a stiﬂing
life at the hands of yet another “op-
pressor.”

Students plan demonstration for trustee meeting

By Michael Ashford

Assistant News Editor

The University of Pittsburgh's board
of trustees will meet students
demonstrating in support of total divest-
ment when trustees arrive on campus
tomorrow for a scheduled meeting.

The students. led by the organization
Students for a Free South Africa. are
demanding that the university divest all
of its funds currently held in companies
which do business in South Africa.

“I think it will be in the interests of
the University of Pittsburgh to open the
issue at this meeting." said Tony
Baldwin. a founding member of SFSA.
“If not. it may come to drastic action
which the university would rather
avoid."

Divestment has been an ongoing issue
on campus for several years now. Last
May the Pitt trustees voted to continue
their investments in companies which

honor the Sullivan Principles. (see box)

But pro—divestment activists consider
the Sullivan Principles ineffective and
that they offer the trustees a means of
avoiding the arguments presented to

em.

“The Sullivan Principles are a deceit-
ful appeal to the public to divert their at-
tention away from the issues at hand."

said SFSA member Doug Howell.
"While the Sullivan Principles affect one
percent of the black population. they for-
tify the apartheid regime with SI4 billion
of financial transaction."

Members of SFSA had previously at-
tempted to obtain a copy of Pitt‘s coin-
plete investment portfolio over the past
several months without success. They had

at Pitt.”

Tlcriiversity Policy

0 To date, the university holds $19.6 million in 34 companies which
do business in South Africa of a total of $160 million in investments.

0 The Sullivan Principles mandate non-segregation of the work
place, equal pay for equal or comparable work for all employees, in-
itiation and development of training programs that will present blacks
and other non-white workers opportunity for promotion and improving
the quality of employees’ lives outside the workplace.

0 To develop and implement, according to The Uizivei'.s‘iry Times, “a
program to provide black South African employees of Pittsburgh cor-
porations doing business in South Africa with scholarships to study

awo-

intended to submit the portfolio to Robert
Zevin. chairman of Ethical Investors Inc.
of Boston. so that he could demonstrate
that total divestment could be executed
at little or no loss to the university.

"Zevin is also vice president of U.S.
Trust in Boston and has been handling
South African free investments for
private corporations for 17 years." said
Howell.

In a recent phone interview. Zevin
pointed to his success in handling the
University of Michigan’s divestment
process. The Michigan case resulted in

The battle to get the Cray X-MP/48
suffered a setback last June when NSF
officials announced that they could
transfer a Cray l—S supercomputer
from the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration‘s Lewis
Research Center in Cleveland to the
Pittsburgh universities.

The Cray l—S transfer was not made
when Pitt and CMU officials
discovered they still had a chance to
receive the Cray X—MP/48. Pitt’s new
supercomputer will be five times as
powerful as the Cray 1-S.

Seventeen competing universities
were turned down for the money. and
the Pitt-CMU partnership apparently
paid off. Posvar said the special part-
nership between the two schools served
as the basis for the award.

CMU President Richard Cyert
agreed that the partnership was the
reason for getting the grant.

“I believe Carnegie-Mellon‘s
outstanding computer science research
and the University of Pittsburgh‘s pro-

concluded that "total divestment would
have ‘little or no economic impact on the
income derived [by Pitt] from the invest-
ment endowment portfolio.‘ "

The subcommittee was acting under the
aegis of the University Senate budget
policy committee and presented its find-
ing last Jan. 24. according to the Univer-
.s'ir_\‘ Tinies.

Other conclusions by the subcommit-
tee noted that growing instability in South
Africa has made investments increasingly
risk prone. that “ ‘an increasing number
of prominent black South African leaders
have called for complete divestment‘ by
U.S. businesses and universities." and
that "Pitt has a responsibility to provide
‘moral as well as intellectual leader-
ship’ " in regards to the issue.

said.

The supercomputing center will be
known as the Pittsburgh Center for Ad-
vanced Computing in Engineering and
the Sciences. and will be operated by
Pitt. CMU and the Westinghouse Elec-
tric Corporation.

Offices for the supercomputer center
will be located in the Mellon Institute
in Oakland while the Cray X-MP/48
will be located at the Westinghouse
Energy Systems Computer Center in
Monroeville. Pitt faculty and students
will have access to the supercomputer
through Pitt terminals.

continued from page I

So what‘s new‘? The difference is.
said Hart. that he foresees an "active"
government which will promote eco-
nomic growth with “new policies that
recognize the revolutionary world of
the late 20th century.“

Leaving revolution aside, Hart does
hint at economic planning and at a
business/government collaborative ef-
fort to produce “a new agenda for
economic growth for 20 to 30 years. “
Reaganomics is erroneous. he said.
because “something has to decide
where the [market] engine is going and
using what fuel."

First, of course, Hart proposes
reducing the growth-stifling national
debt which by forcing up interest rates
crowds out domestic investment and
burdens export-oriented industries
through an inﬂated dollar on the inter-
national exchange. To reduce the def-
icit. Hart calls for freezing defense
spending, taxing oil imports from the
Persian Gulf and reforming entitlement
programs. Entitlement reform, al-
though Hart is not clear on this, would
apparently be based on the returns
those programs can demonstrate after
a cost—benefit type of analysis.

Next, Hart proposes a revamping of
the education system. “It‘s inex-
cusable,” he said. “that one-fourth of
our students never graduate from high
school and that American students cur-
rently study only a fraction of the math
and science of their Japanese and Rus-
sian counterparts.”

Thus, Hart calls for more govern-

Senator Gary Hart
ment investment in education and the
rewriting of school curricula to include
more math and sciences to increase the
nation’s long—term competitiveness. In
addition, he wants to make foreign
language skills mandatory in public
schools. Private sector corporations, he
said. should also “adopt” schools and
work to improve them. .

‘Clandestine drugs’
topic of coming talk

By Lisa Podrat
For The Pitt News

"Designer drugs" are fast becom-
ing the newest fashion among drug
abusers in California. While Under-
ground chemists are cashing in on a
gold mine. This new craze is the sub-
ject of an upcoming lecture by Dr.
William Soine of the University of
Virginia. as part of the annual Phar-
macy Week. sponsored by the School
of Pharmacy.

Designer drugs are analogs of com-
pounds such as demerol, a potent
painkiller. and fentanyl, a powerful
narcotic that is 100 times more potent
than morphine. Fentanyl is medically
used as an anesthetic in surgical pro-
cedures and is as addictive as morphine
or heroin. Those who use analogs of
fentanyl experience the same high as
if they were actually taking heroin.

And because of vague drug laws.
some of these designer drugs are legal.
Until they can properly classified by
the government as illegal substances,
they will continue to be made and sold.

According to Frank Sapienza, a
chemist at the Drug Enforcement Ad-
ministration headquarters in Wash-
ington, D.C., a $2,000 investment in
glassware and chemicals can turn out
about a kilogram of 3-methylfentanyl,
an analog of fentanyl, which is worth
$1 billion on the street. This means that
now there is a potent narcotic street
drug that can take the place of heroin.

The designer drugs are becoming

Robinson talks on U.S.

By David James
For The Pitt News

According to Randall Robinson, the
head of Trans-Africa who spoke here
at Pitt last Friday night, there are dif-
ferent reasons why apartheid exists in
South Africa today.

Robinson spoke before a small but
enthusiastic crowd about the many
problems which plague the African
continent — including the situation in
South Africa. He also spoke of socie-
ty’s continuing ignorance and our re-
sponsibility as members of the human
race.

“Democracy, to be workable, is sup-
posed to be rooted in an enlightened
citizen. The fact is that most Americans
grow up in this country thinking that
it’s not only the most powerful, it‘s the
richest and the best country on earth,”
said Robinson. “Thinking themselves
to be very sophisticated, a people
steeped in wisdom, going to the best
universities, reading the best papers
and buying the best books ...Americans
don‘t know anything about anything
west of Los Angeles or east of Wash-

ington, D.C."

That ignorance is not just applicable
to the average citizen. It applies to the
government of the United States as
well. According to Robinson, a mem-
ber of Congress once told him that he
didn‘t think there were 20 members of
Congress who could name three Afri-
can countries.

“Not more than a month ago, when
I was testifying before the House sub-
committee on Africa, a congressman

. said ‘Look, .we got to help the
Angolan people.’ There are some
Somalian people, and there are some
Mongolian people, but there are no
Angolan people,” said Robinson. This
man, a member of the U.S. Congress,
wanted to provide $27 million in Amer-
ican assistance to overthrow the
government of a people he cannot
name.“

Robinson stressed that America and
Americans basically know of only one
thing which they are opposed to: the
Soviet Union and communism.

The point was stressed with the
plight of Nelson Mandela. Many peo-

problems for drug treatment centers.
People enrolled in drug rehabilitation
programs. or who are on parole. are
able to use these drugs and currently
cannot be caught because these Chern-
ical substances do not show up in the
standard blood and urine tests.

In the Sept. 9. I985 issue_of Chemi-
cal & Eizgiizeeriizg News. Robert J.
Robertson. chief of the Division of
Drug Programs of California's Depart-
ment of Alcohol and Drug Programs.
said. "[3—methyIfentanyl] is a perfect
drug for people on parole or on pro-
bation. People in drug treatment pro-
grams can use it. and it will not show
up in the routine tests."

Before a new drug is approved by the
FDA, it must first be tested in animals.
With the designer drugs. the chemists
bypass this as well as other regulations.
and humans become the first site of
testing. This has led to several cases
of irreversible Parkinson’s disease and
even death as a result of impurities in
uncontrolled compounds. Robertson
refers to this as “designer drug dis-
aster."

Presently, the use of designer drugs
is confined to the West Coast, how-
ever, if not contained, it could well
become a national drug problem. On
Wednesday, Feb. 12, Dr. Soine will
speak at the School of Pharmacy on the
issue of “clandestine drugs” as part of
Pharmacy Week. The lecture will be
held in Lecture Room 6 of Scaife Hall
at noon. The public is welcome to
attend.

and Africa

ple know about Andre Sakharov be-
cause he is anti—Soviet. Less know, or
care, about Mandela because he is op-
posed to a government which is a de
facto ally of the United States.

Apathy. according to Robinson. con-
tinues to be a problem in the struggle
for human rights, both on the African
continent and around the world. Robin-
son feels this is a dangerous attitude
for students to have for long.

“Students tend to think that if
something hasn’t gone wrong. then it
won’t, and the world will go on as it
has. What I am describing is a world
increasingly dangerous to live in. A
world in which the ‘haves’ are having
more, and the ‘have nots’ are having
less. A world in which there are a lot
of very pained people living under very
difficult circumstances, with a capaci-
ty to hold the world for ransom because
they’ve been so abused and so angry.
You see rises in terrorism, and we
make all the inappropriate responses.
Students should care because this is the
world they‘re inheriting, and it‘s a
world that may in their own lifetime
become simply unlivable.“

Is jealousy a wasted emotion?

By Natashia Henderson
The Pitt News

Exactly what are the origins of this
powerful emotion‘? Many psychologists
believe that jealousy is a primitive sur-
vival instinct innate in all of us.

Undoubtedly, jealousy is one of the
most intense human emotions. It often in-
cludes sensations of panic, loneliness,
pain. humiliation, competitiveness and
uncertainty. More distressing yet is that
you can‘t control these emotions. They
seem to happen all at once. One Pitt stu-
dent said. “When I amjealous. I feel like
I have lost total control of myself. It's like

I am in a tunnel. I can’t see or hear
anything that is going on in the outside
world. My concentration is totally limited
to the isolated incident."

Jealousy’s pain is intense and deep.
Some claimjealousy is proof of love, but
if you have felt both, you know that th
are opposites. ‘

While love is generous. patient and
supportive, jealousy is impatient, de-
manding and selfish. The jealous in-
dividual is only concerned with his or her
welfare and the threat he or she may be
posed with.

Although jealousy is often associated
with powerful emotions like love, Dr.
Frank Colavita. head of the psychology
department at the University of Pitts-
burgh, suggests thatjealousy arises from
a deficiency of love. which stems from
the dependency of being in a relationship.
He also suggests that jealousy arises from
a need for power and control. and that
it should not represent a scale to measure
how much we care about someone.

“I wasn’t even happy when my
boyfriend got a football scholarship to
Pitt.“ admitted a female Pitt student. "I
was too consumed with jealousy. I knew
all the girls would be after him once he
got to college. I was so concerned with
myself. Would he leave me after he came
to school? How would I exist without
him?" '

Sexual jealousy can be a problem.
especially on a college campus. Ninety
percent of participants in a study by
Cosmopolitan Magazine on “Sexual
Jealousy Toward Your Lover" had
reported feeling sexually jealous in the
past six months.

While sexual jealousy is usually the
most passionate. other types ofjealousy
are also quite detrimental to the growth
of various relationships. For example, the
|eft—out feeling that you get when a good
friend chooses to conﬁde in another and

not you. or the competition that is felt
when a brother or sister is favored in the
parents’ eyes. Anger, frustrations. and
even hatred all seem to stem from the
emotion we refer to as jealousy.

In many ways, jealousy created a no-
win situation. The same emotions that
cause us to cling to mother and demand
affection are the same ones that drive our
lovers away.

Many students felt that the most pain-
ful part ofjealousy is the unresolved ten-
sion that is involved. To Linda, a senior
business major. jealousy toward an ex-
boyfriend of two years was a major hin-
drance in the growth of their relationship.
"The unresolved tension we were suffer-
ing from stemmed from the rages of
jealousy I used to experience. I knew
Mark was a desirable guy. the kind of
guy dozens of girls wanted to date. I used
to get so jealous when we would go out.

I couldn't handle it when women bat-
ted their eyelashes at him. It made me
want to throw Lip. The breakup was my
fault. Instead of talking about our prob-
lems. I'd send myself into a fury and have
him take me home. We just weren’t
growing with each other anymore. the
main reason being my insane jealousy."

In retrospect of the relationship, Lin-
da said she does see her jealousy as the
cause of its demise.

“I can’t believe how foolishly I acted.
At the time I had no idea of how to
displace those emotions and channel them
toward something powerful and pro-
gressive. We could have learned and
grown forward in our relationship. In-
stead, I let it tear us apart.”

In the majority of sociological studies
that have been conducted, researchers
have found that men and women suffer
from equal amounts of jealousy. It is
women. however, that suffer this emo-
tion far more intensely. The studies sug-
gest that more women will attempt
to“save” a relationship. where men are
more likely to part with a lover over the
same incidents.

One single Pitt faculty member de-
scribed how he allowed jealousy to rule
his love life. “Before I even am too in-
volved with a woman, I am possessed
with making sure they only want me. My
deepest fear is that I’ll lose a woman to

 

another man. It’s happened before and
leaves me with such feelings of inade-
quacy. Ijust can”t deal with it."

The roots of intense jealousy usually
stem from low self—esteem. Social
psychologist Gregory White found that
people whose self—respeet depended on
their partners‘ judgement were far more
jealous than those who believed in
themselves. Also. those who were most
jealous felt that they were the most—in—
love partner in the relationship. When
one's se|f—esteem is low. he or she tends
to be less secure and in turn is more easily
threatened. Those who have a positive
self—image are usually more confident in
love and less easily provoked to jealousy.

In the case of suffering from jealousy’s

The Pitt News, February 10, I986

irrational beha’vior, professionals in the
field suggest that you consider working
on your self—conf1dence. In doing so. they
suggest that you should emphasize focus-
ing on your good qualities and not on
your bad ones. Also. most importantly.
they feel you should always anticipate
success and not failure. Jealousy has no
place in the confident person‘s life.
Researchers also suggest thatjealousy
can be overcome by “fighting the feel-
ing," when it seems to be overtaking
you. Instead of giving into jealousy,
channel that energy toward something
that will have a positive impact on your
relationship. Secondly, and most impor-
tantly, work towards the creation of a
more positive and confident self—image.

Artist blends drama with drawing in creations

By Patrick Good
Staff Writer

For Mary Culbertson-Stark, the
union of drama and drawing has been
the origin of her creative energy since
childhood. She has been involved in the
arts for nearly 18 years and will bring
her artistic talent to the University of
Pittsburgh campus for exhibition.

Painted drawings by artist
Culbertson—Stark will be exhibited in
the William Pitt Union Art Gallery
Feb. 17-28, 1986. The one-woman ex-
hibition entitled “Facial Dialogue”
will feature recent works in ink and
acrylic. The gallery, located on the
main floor of the student union
building. is open Monday through Fri-
day frorn 12-8 p.m. Culbertson-Stark’s
opening reception will be Monday.
Feb. 17 from 5-8 p.m.

The Art Gallery is a very nice thing
to have in the William Pitt Union and
at the University of Pittsburgh.” said
Pitt Program Council Art Exhibit Com-
mittee Chairman Torn Yates. "Mary
Stark is a great artist and it’s a pleasure
to exhibit her works. She will have
some interesting art to show in our
gallery.”

At age 13, while studying drama at
the Pittsburgh Playhouse, she recogniz-
ed her penchant for people. She credits
her early theater experience and a long
line of good teachers with providing the
impetus for pursuing images and sup-
porting the development of her unique
style.

“I really like people,” said
Culbertson-Stark.“I’ve chosen a pro-
fession that I can be with many dif-
ferent people. From the theater and
people, I transformed my energy from
theater arts to visual arts.”

She earned a bachelor of fine arts
degree from the University of South
Carolina in 1975. During her
undergraduate work she discovered a
preference for visual arts, along with
an interest for drawing. “I grew up in
Pittsburgh,” she said, “but I went
south to see the differences in people.“

After graduation, she returned home
from South Carolina to Pittsburgh to
teach. Since her return, Culbertson-
Stark has taught art in the Bethel Park
School District. She has received
honors from her peers for her effort in

Drawing by _Mary Culbertson-Stark

art education. She was named to Bethel
Park School District’s Outstanding
Teacher list in 1982.

Her teaching efforts don‘t end there
either. She has taught children’s art
lessons for several local art centers for
nine years. Teaching has played a ma-
jor part of her life for 11 years. From
teaching, Culbertson—Stark has found
the opportunity to be around people,
and people are her life. “Teaching is
an integral part of my work. Teaching

is a good balance and a chance to-

evaluate my own work. There is
nothing more gratifying than seeing a
student’s idea come to fruition. I love
the challenge of teaching," said
Culbertson-Stark.

Culbertson-Stark is not only a
teacher, but a student with a thirst to
learn even more. While working days
teaching, she becomes a student at
night. She took classes for four years

to earn a master of art education degree
from the University of Pittsburgh
where her studies concentrated on pro-
gram design and curriculum
implementation.

Former instructor Tom Lacey from
the University of Pittsburgh’s Art
Education Department said, “Mary
was most concerned with improving
classroom skills. She concentrated on
having good positive feelings for the
application of teaching skill.”

Culbertson-Stark never stops look-
ing to learn from anyone or anywhere,
whether it be in the classroom or while
simply studying people when on vaca-
tion. “I adore people. I love talking to
them, watching them, understanding
their needs and motives.

“I like to focus on the ordinary per-
son. I will study a person for a couple
of weeks, then I’ll do the drawing and
consequently the painting. Picasso and

Matisse is wherr I get many of my
ideas and they’ve inﬂuenced my style
—— its more spontaneous,” said
Culbertson-Stark.

A frequent exhibitor, Culbertson-
Stark has shown her work in a variety
of galleries locally like the Pittsburgh
Center for the Arts, Three Rivers Arts
Festival and the Wiebe Gallery, as well
as various locales in North and South
Carolina and Washington, D.C. Cur-
rently, her work can be seen at the Car-
son Street Gallery in Southside.

Culbertson—Stark’s professional af-
filiations include: the South Hills Art
League, Pennsylvania Art Education
Association, Art Leagues South, South
Arts and ArtVentures. Presently, she
is working as interim director of the Art
Room Gallery and also serves as presi-
dent of ArtVentures, a local artist’s
group. _

Being selected to show at Pitt was a
rather easy choice for the PPC. “She
was overwhelmingly approved by the
committee,” said Yates.“Everyone
liked her and. most importantly. her art
work. She is one of the nicest people
I‘ve interviewed. She’s easy to talk to
and very outgoing.”

As is the case with many artists,
ranging from visual arts to theater ar-
tists to musicians, support from others
remains a major part of one’s career.
For Culbertson-Stark, her biggest sup-
port comes from her husband, Gary.

Gary Stark is also an artist, but of
a different nature. He is a professional
photographer. His full-time job is with
Allegheny General Hospital as a
technical photographer, but he too
spends many hours pursuing his love
of an art — by taking pictures.

“He is extremely suppportive of my
work,” said Culbertson-Stark. “Our
arts are different in content and style.
We are a compliment to one another.

“I_-Ie’s technically oriented in his
work and meticulous about his
photography. I’m not concerned about
exactness. but he has to be.”

As for her work, Culbertson-Stark
continues to add to her “Faces I Have
Been” collection. Those familiar with
Culbertson—Stark’s art are well aware
of the success of that graphic art col-
lection.

For the Pitt exhibit, however,
Culbertson-Stark will present a new

collection entitled “Facial Dialogues.”
The recent paintings in ink and acrylic
feature background and other en-
vironmental treatment as added dimen-
sion. She views her work as
“deliberately choreographed com-
posites resulting from observations and
experiences.”

Of her work, she commented, “My
work is a measurable result of what I’m
seeing, doing,  living. I try not to
steer my mind images or make them
too perfect. The beauty of human
nature lies not in it’s symmetry, but in
its incongruity. Even incongruity has
a sense of harmony  a balance all its
own.”

Down the road, Culbertson-Stark is
hoping her current course will change.
“I haven’t met the art public of Pitts-
burgh yet. There are more people to
see and more art galleries to show at.”

As for an audience, Culbertson—Stark
is continuing her efforts to spread her
name and work locally. She and her
work were featured on WTAE’s
“Black Chronicle” and at the 1985 Na-
tional Student Council Conference.

She knows, however, that Pittsburgh
may not be the only answer. “My au-
dience may be in Washington, DC.”
mentioned Culbertson—Stark. “More
than likely I will show more there. I
won’t ever move to D.C., because I
love Pittsburgh and my subjects are
here.”

For every artist there comes a time
to move on. For the moment, at 32,

Culbertson-Stark is enjoying her ‘
possibilities of making it bigger. She’

continues to work hard at being a stu-
dent of the art world and to expand her
audience, but she’s well aware the
future may have more to offer.
Teaching is again the subject of future
thought.

“I’d like to get my arts management ’

degree from Carnegie-Mellon,” said
Culbertson—Stark. “I would then like
to someday open my own joint gallery-
school to teach my style of art.

I would love to have teachers
teaching my style to others and for
others to learn my style. There is cer-
tainly a lot to learn about the images
of others. It’s part of my teaching
background. I like the idea of my work
being left up to the person to decide

March of Dimes reaches teens

The March of Dimes Birth Defects
Foundation is providing many
thousands of adolescents across the na-
tion with information on good health
practices in its efforts to prevent birth
defects.

One effective way of communicating
with this young teen audience is through
a cooperative adolescent health educa-
tion project of the March of Dimes
and the American Medical Student
Association. The community—based
project taps the talents of medical
students to reach out to teens to promote
positive health behaviors, especially in
regard to teenage pregnancy and healthy
childbearing.

The March of Dimes is concerned
with reaching this audience because
some 560,000 teenage girls give birth
each year. Babies born to these young
teen mothers have a higher risk of birth
defects and serious health problems.

The goal of the project is to address
more adequately adolescents’ com-
plicated health care needs and to create
a positive influence on their health-
related decisions.

The program sessions establish a rap-
port between the medical student
volunteers and their audiences in an at-
mosphere of trust and understanding.
An important effect of the two-year-old
program has been to sensitize the future
physicians to their patients’ needs, and to
their role as caregivers.

“Medical students have jumped at the
opportunity to participate in this proj-

president and a student at Sophie Davis-

“The purpose of the grants is to help
teachers realize their dreams. to enable
them to live out an experience that
enriches their lives. as well as the lives
of their colleagues and students," said
Futrell.

The NEA president noted that
McAuliffe urged her students to "reach
for the stars" — the philosophy that
ultimately led toher selection as the
first teacher — an ordinary citizen —
to ride in space.

“Christa was not afraid to take risks
and, in many ways, that is what educa-
tion is all about — teaching children to
take chances in order to seek answers.”

members at some schools receive elective
credit for participating. To help prepare
medical student volunteers to carry out
the community service projects, the
March of Dimes sponsors training ses-
sions for the medical school-based
teams.

Working with a local March of Dimes
staff member or volunteer, the teams
commit their service for one semester
and agree to train a new team to take over
for them at the completion of their time
commitment.

Before deciding what format their
programs will take, the teams perform an
assessment ofadolescent health needs in
their communities. Each program is then
geared to the medical students‘ talents,
the community's resources, and the
adolescents‘ needs, particularly those in
the inner city.

The medical students have translated
their training into creative health educa
tion and community service projects at
the local level. Successful AMSA pro-
grams have been implemented at local
schools and teen pregnancy clinics. Some
AMSA teams carry out lecture series
while others establish one-on-one health
education sessions between the medical
students and teenagers. Topics include
responsible childbearing, as well as the
influence of poor nutrition, drug abuse,
and sexually transmitted diseases on the
outcome of pregnancy.

Other teams have set up “buddy”
systems where a medical student team
member acts as advisor and support per-
son to a pregnant teen throughout her
pregnancy, encouragingher to keep doc-
tor's appointments, to eat properly and
follow good health practices, and will
even attend at delivery, if desired.

from Rutgers University School of
Osteopathic Medicine, said, “working

improve job search  

By Jack Burkman

Nervous about an upcoming inter-
view? Pitt’s Placement Center can
help. Since September, Susan
Hudachek, a student intern at the
center, has conducted literally hundreds
of simulated interviews.

According to Hudachek, conditions
are as close to reality as possible in the
mock interviews. “I research the posi-
tion and then interview the student,”
said Hudachek.

Because all mock interviews are
videotaped, would—be applicants can
critique their presentation. According
to Robert Hopkins, director of the
Placement Center, this is perhaps the
program’s best feature.

“One must realize he communicates
on multiple levels,” said Hopkins.
“The only way you can objectively
evaluate your performance is to see and
hear yourself  the immediate feed-
back is spectacular. The applicant is
given live audio-visual feedback in a
non—threatening situation.”

Hopkins points out that the mock in-
terviews also are designed to build
self—esteem.

“There is a tremendous amount of
negativism implanted into job hunt-
ing," said Hopkins. “We don’t want
to add to it  It’s the mock interview
done in a way that does not diminish
confidence... We are trying to enhance
and develop a candidate's qualifica-
tions."

The interviews are thorough. Ques-
tions pertaining to academic achieve-
ment, extra-curricular activities, self-
description, self—analysis and future
goals are all asked. '

Hudachek. immediately following an
interview, attempts to make the appli-
cant realize his own strong points and
deficiencies. According to Hopkins, an
applicant must be ready. “One must
prepare for an interview so that he may
be a full participant in the interview,"
he said.

“Mock interviews are nothing new
to the Placement Center. In the past,
however, they only were conducted on
a limited basis,” said Hopkins.“Costs
were high and video equipment was ex-
tremely. cumbersome,” he said. He
pointed out that the interviews were
taking the time of placement employees
who had other obligations. “We need-
ed someone who would specialize in
the service,” said Hopkins.

The Placement Center staff solved
the problem by creating a “placement
intern” position. Since then, the pro-
gram has been able to more successful-
ly operate on a large scale, Hopkins
said.

Hudachek said she believes virtual-
ly all university majors can benefit
from the service. In fact, anyone
registered with the Placement Center
may sign up for an interview.
Hudachek noted, though, that time
restricts the number of people she can
see.

"I’m always booked,” she said.
“sometimes as much as two weeks in
advance."

The Pitt News, February 10, 1986

By Bob Travers
Staff Writer

If it’s true that the early bird catches
the worm. it must also be true that the
early Panther‘ gets the Wildcat.

Roy Chipman took a team which had
been humiliated by Seton Hall. threw
them onto the practice court at the
ungodly hour of7 a.m. a few days last
week and, what to our wandering eyes
should appear. but a Pitt team capable
of pounding the defending National
Champion Villanova Wildcats 85-71 at
the field house Friday night.

“I think the key was intensity." Pitt
coachlRoy Chipman said. “We came
out, and we played hard. We took the
game to them on our court.“

Pitt did exactly that. pressuring the
young Villanova squad into numerous
first-half mistakes. allowing Pitt to take
a commanding 24-10 lead with six
minutes remaining in the first half. The
Wildcat offense was so inept that it
went a full five minutes without sco_r-
ing a point.

It was during that stretch that Pitt put
the game out of reach. The Panthers
were overpowering in the final minutes
of the first half as they stretched their
lead from 16-10 with about 10 minutes
left. to 40-24 at the intermission.

“We said this week we would have
to show character.“ Chipman noted.
“And 1 think we did that. It was an ‘in-
tense game.”

The character the Panthers somehow
found at their dawn practice sessions
was never more evident than during the

opening minutes of the second half.
Villanova scored the first five points
alter the break. and it looked for a
while like Pitt fan.s were in for another

showing of “How To Lose a Lead." .

But a dunk by Keith Armstrong started
the Panther offensive machinery for the
second half, and Pitt rattled off six
points in a row. After that stretch.
Villanova’s will seemed to be broken.
and Pitt cruised the rest of the way,
never letting the Wildcats get closer
than a 10-point deficit. I

"I think we beat a good team tonight.
and we beat them convincingly." Cur-

tis Aiken observed. “I just think they -

weren’t as aggressive."

Aiken scored six points and was one
of five Panthers who fouled out of the
game. The three officials called the
game closely, to say the least. A total
of 72 personal fouls were called. and
of those, 38 were called on Pittplayers.

“This was the most fouls I have ever
seen called in a game." Chipman said.
“The officials were intent on control-
ling the game, and I think they did a
good job."

Had the officials called the game any
more loosely, they could very well
have ended up with a blood bath on
their hands. This was a game of sim-
mering. emotional undertones that
threatened to come to the surface on
several occassions. Shoving matches
came close to becoming bench-clearing
brawls at least twice. After one flare-
up. Villanova’s Gary Massey was
called for a technical foul.

Charles Smith thought the fouls kept
the game from becoming a rout. “It
wasn't the blowout it might have

been." he said. “They were taking a
lot of free throws all game. It was
ridiculous how ‘many fouls they
called."

With so many Panthers in foul trou-
ble. the bench became a key for Pitt.
Jerome Lane responded with a 16-point
performance, and Darryl Shepherd
came in from the cold to add five points
and set up a whole slew of nifty Pan-
ther baskets during his 10 minutes on

"the floor.‘

Keith Armstrong continued to shine
as well. He was good for 14 points and
a career—high 13 rebounds before foul-
ing out with three minutes left. Arm-
strong exited the game to a standing
ovation from the 6.798 in attendance.

The win puts Pitt at 5-5 in the Big
East with six league games left. Had
Pitt lost this game, they would have
been three games behind fourth—place
Villanova. It was undoubtedly an im-
portant win. but Pitt’s players are wary
of calling it a watershed in Pitt’s roller
coaster ride through the Big East this
year.

“This is just another game,” Smith
cautioned. “We’ve been through this
too many times to say this win will turn
the season around.”

cent of its 42 free throws  The overall
Panther record stands at
Villanova is now 16-10, 6-4 in the Big

The Pitt News has received a lot of
publicity over last week’s hype con-
cerning Doug West, the Villanova
freshman forward who stated that a Pitt
alumnus offered him $10,000 to attend
school here. Villanova head coach
Rollie Massimino was visibly upset on
all the local television news programs
about how Friday’s article may create
a bad scene. Massimino said it was a
damn shame that a freshman had to go
through such a terrible thing. He also
said there was no room for it in col-
lege basketball.

Well. I guess there is no room for
fun in college basketball either. Maybe
he should have worried a little more
about the Pitt basketball team rather
than The Pitt News. As it turned out,
the basketball team was the one that
burned him, as Pitt ran away with an
85-71 win.

“People have to realize that this is
just a game,“ Massimino said follow-
ing the game outside his locker room.
“lt‘s unfortunate that something like
that had to happen. It‘s a damn
shame.” _

Massimino was said to have phoned

Robert'Wilson, a Villanova team
manager, also told me before the game
that the team changed hotels and add-
ed security. /

What did Rollie think we were go-
ing to do, plant a bomb? I guess nobody
except our sports department had con-
ﬁdence that the Pitt students could play
a role in the game without the use of
dirty tactics.

Sure, a dime was thrown onto the
court a few games back, but after a
warning everything has been clean.

The students did play a role in the
game. They played out the part of

Randy Miller

agitating fans to perfection. They sang
“Doug—gie" every time West touched
the ball, but there was nothing thrown
at West. no profanity. just good old-
fashioned fun. Phoney checks, and
dollar bills with West's picture in the;
middlejust added to the humor behind
the entire situation.

In fact, when each one of the four
Villanova players who fouled out left
the game. the students sang the “Hey.
hey. hey, good-bye“ song. I suppose
Massimino didn’t approve of that
either.

Massimino tried to show the Pitt fans

where to put their fun by setting up an
alley—oop to West on Villanova’s first
possession. If it had worked, it would
have been a conﬁdence-builder for both
West and Villanova. The play failed.

That play set the tone for the whole
game as West suffered through one of
his poorest performances. West scored
only ﬁve points. connecting on only 2-8
shots from the floor, made only 1-3
free throws and turned the ball "over
four times before fouling out.

Certainly the students played a big
role in West’s poor outing, which in
turn hurt Villanova’s chances of win-
ning. But the question I ask is, what
is wrong with having fun at the 01’ ball
game? Did we say Doug West is a liar,
that he was out to get Pitt and should
be crucified? No! ‘

Maybe West was offered the money,
but that isn’t for us to decide. And
maybe he is a nice guy. I did meet West
in Philadelphia. and he seemed to be
just that. Still, he provided an oppor-
tunity for the students to get involved
in the game. \

We are to act as professionals, but
this is a student newspaper. I believe
we are allowed to be biased at times‘.
The Pitt News has nothing against Doug
West. But when he plays at Pitt, he will
think the Fitzgerald Field House is a
temple of doom. —

Congratulations. students. on a fine I

effort and for acting in the fashion I
knew you would.

Wrestlers lose first

Penn State pins Panthers

By Patrick Good
Staff Writer

The Pitt wrestling team traveled to
Penn State this weekend to face its big-
gest challenge of the season. the nations
fourth-ranked Nittany Lions. The Pan-
thers received a lesson in the dif-
ferences between‘ the Top 20 teams.
between those at the top of the ladder
and those at the bottom. Pitt lost 34-5
but wasn't the only team to be taught
such a lesson.

The Panthers patiently sat through
pre-match preparations with con-
ﬁdence. Before stepping on the mat.
they had an unbeaten 7-0-2 record. Out
on the mat, their opponent easily was
running through the University of
Michigan lineup. When the Panthers
finally entered the Lions‘ den. Penn
State had already finished lunch, eating
the No. 15 Wolverines alive 32-12.

The Panthers entered the match
ranked No. 19 and were set to battle

3 the Lions tooth and nail. From the start,

things began to turn dark and cold for
Pitt. The nation’s No. 2 ranked.
118-pounder beat the Panthers Steve
Kasza 14-4. Following, Penn State's
Tim Flynn handled Pitt’s John Hnath,
shutting the senior down 11-0.

With the team score now 8-0, Pitt’s
Kyle Nellis was up next. and the co-
captain had hopes of getting the Pan—
thers on the board. Unfortunately.
Nellis lost for only his fifth time 4-3
to States Joe Hadge. by virtue of a
penalty point. For Hadge it was an
upset win ashe set the tone for his Nit-
tany Lion teammates. It would be a
long day in (un)Happy Valley.

"The key to the match." said
Hadge. “was I listened to my coaches.
I had to rely on my strengths and what
1 had to do to win. it worked out for
me. He [Nellis] was unfortunate that
1 benefited from his mistake."

Penn State coach Rich Lorenzo had
similar feelings. “I have togive Hadge

credit.“ said Lorenzo. "He was real-
ly tough and didn't make many mental
errors. Nellis did. and it cost him. This
was a key match -— last time Nellis won
something like 8-0."

Pat Santoro followed for Pitt’s only
win with a 6-1 decision. boosting his
team's leading record to 23-4. The ‘vic-
tory also establishes the freshman as the
man to beat at 142-lbs. in the Eastern
Wrestling League.

After Joe Bond and the Panthers
were surprised by a pin from State's
Gary Kaschak. Pitt fell behind 17-3.

With nothing to lose and everything
to gain, senior Doug Haines went out
to prove his worth against Greg Elin-
sky. the nation‘s No. 1 158-pounder
and last year's NCAA runner-up.

Haines nearly pinned Elinsky in the
first period. but the two eventually
rolled out of bounds. The near fall by
Haines left Elinsky trailing 6-2. but the
State junior did come back strong to
win 12-9. Haines was more than hap-
py with his performance and knows
Elinsky must take notice.

“You can't win if you don’t go after
it." said Haines. “If I just went out
there to hang close, I would have
kicked myself. I definitely got his at-

tention. Theiteam score looked really ‘~

bad. but they got all the close ones.”

The only other Panther points were
tallied by 190-pounder Curtis Conner
who battled State's Jan Johnson to a 4-4
draw. The tie for Conner leaves his
junior season record even at 10-10-2.

"You have to understand.“ said
Conner, “the roadblock we ran into is
one of the best teams in the country.
I definitely think this team will bounce
back. We can do it."

“That was a tougher dual meet than
the score showed." said Lorenzo.
"There were close individual matches.
and we won them. Plus a couple of six-
pointers made the score double.

The Pitt-News.'February 10. 1986

“They're a much improved team and
the_y‘ve worked hard." he continued.
"You must also realize that we're start-
ing to hit our peak right now."

Panther head coach Rande Stot-
tlemyer was disappointed. though he
knows the loss isn't time to quit. Stot-
tlemyer would rather use the setback
as a time to move on and to learn from
their mistakes.

“We wrestled hard." said Stot-
tlemyer. “We didn’t wrestle like we
have in the past. Penn State is a real
tough team. They‘re deserving of the
No. 4 ranking in the country.

“It will be interesting to see how our
guys will come back. Ifthey use it the
right way. they should bounce back
from this. The guys have to continue
to work hard. and they just need to
keep their nose to the grindstone.”

The Panthers will next try to move
onward and rebound from Saturday’s
major blow. The road won’t get much
easier, however. as Pitt must face two
EWL rivals. No. 7 Bloomsburg and
No. 3 Clarion in the next 10 days.

Pitt is now 2-1-1 in EWL competi-
tion, which places them in sole posses-
sion of second place. The first chance
to get back on track comes Saturday as
the Panthers travel to Bloomsburg. The

‘ Huskies are the EWL's third-place
team. currently 1-2 in the league.

Lady gymnasts lose
close one to Penn State

By Mike Ryan
For The Pitt News

PITTSBURGH - The Pitt Lady
Panthers fell short to Penn State (8-3)
by the score of 177.0 to 176.0 in an
exciting gymnastics meet last Saturday
afternoon at Trees Hall. The biggest
margin was the difference in the final
score. At the end of two of the four
events only one—half of a point
separated the two teams.

The Penn State squad is considered
by many to be one of the top teams in
the country. This explains why there
were a lot of heads held high on the Pitt
team. Two of Pitt’s top gymnasts, Alisa
Spector and Beth Waters, returned after
several weeks of absence due to in-
juries. However, neither were able to
compete in all four events which in-
cluded the vault, uneven bar, balance
beam and the ﬂoor exercise.

Louis Liguori, the women’s assistant
gymnastics coach at Pitt, also was
pleased with his teams performance last
Saturday. “I felt our team did a great
job today,” said Liguori. “We held

tough throughout the meet.”

Coach Liguori gave high praise to
Spector and Waters. “Ally [Spector’s
nickname] and Beth showed how
strong competitors they are,” said
Liguori. “Ally practiced for the first
time yesterday [last Friday] since three
weeks ago and did a fine job.”

“Beth also did a fine job after her
two—week layoff due to an ankle in-
jury,” said Liguori.

The women’s gymnastics team not
only had to overcome injuries but Penn
State’s two top performers, Kathy
Parody and Pam Loree as well. Parody
ended the day as the top performer in
the all—around with a total score of
36.60. She scored no lower than 9.05.

Two—time All-America Pam Loree
participated in only two events but the
senior made her presence felt. She
scored a 9.05 on the uneven bars and
had a clutch routine on the floor exer-
cise with a score of 9.4.

Loree‘s 9.4 pretty much clinched a
victory for the Lady Lions.

Loree and Spector were opponents
today but they were not opponents nine

a Klafter

years ago. “Alisa and I went to the
same club [Niagra Gym School] when
we were in the tenth grade,” said
Loree.

There was no strong desire to outdo
one another during the meet. “I just
tried to do as well as I could do today,”
said Spector.

Spector and her team gave the Lady
Lions something to think about just in
case they meet again down the road.
Donna Sanft, the women’s head gym-
nastics coach at Pitt, said, “We have
definitely given Penn State a cause to
think about us today.”

Klafter leads Pitt men A
to win over Kent State

By ShellylRanus
For The Pitt News

The Pitt Panthers men’s gymnastics
team scored its first home victory of
the season on Saturday, defeating the
Kent State Golden Flashes 260.65 to
250.4. The Trees Hall crowd cheered
the team on, unaware of how close the
meet actually was.

The Panthers suffered a serious set-
back earlier in the week that could have
meant disaster against the Golden
Flashes. On Thursday, junior Jim
Gelemas fell and injured his neck while
practicing on the high bar. The injury
ended Gelemas’ season and hurt a Pan-
thers team that lacks depth. Coach
Frank D’Amico was justiﬁably nervous
about the meet.

“I’m very relieved with the results,”
said D’Amico. “After Jim got hurt on
Thursday I was concerned about the
match. Actually it was a very tense
match even though people may not
have realized it.”

One Panther who rose to the occa-
sion was junior Ben Rovee. He ﬁnish-
ed second on the rings with a score of
9.4, third on the parallel bars with an
8.85 and scored 8.75 on the ﬂoor ex-

cercise. For Rovee, it was all a piece
of cake.

“Ben certainly earned a piece of
cheesecake after today,” D’Amieo said
with a smile. “I told him last year that
if he ever scored over an 8.8 on the
parallel bars, I would buy him some
cheesecake. The son of a gun certain-
ly collected on that bet today."

“You know, Ben is just fantastic to
work with,” D’Amico continued. “He
works hard and is always coming up
with new routines. Ben should get a
medal for this meet.”

Another Panther who performed im-
pressively was senior co—captain Mark
Klafter. The Panthers won four of six
events against the Golden Flashes, and
Klafter finished first in each of those
four events. He won the ﬂoor exercise,
the rings and the parallel bars with a
score of 9.55 in each event. Klafter
then ﬁnished the match with a 9.5 to
win the high bar.

Kent State took first place in the
pommel horse and vault. Junior Gary
Toussaint scored a 9.0 to win the horse,
and sophomore Greg Francis record-
ed a 9.3 to win the vault. The Golden
Flashes record fell to 2-5 while the
Panthers are 1-1.

Men notch double Victory

Swimmers make quite a splash

By Teresa Varley
For The Pitt News

Pitt men's swim team took its act on
the road this weekend and came away
with rave reviews.

The Panthers. who ﬁnished the dual-
meet season with a 6-4 record. turned
in two great performances against
Cleveland State on Friday and Kenyon
on Saturday.

Against Cleveland State the Panthers
pulled out a close one. winning 58-55.
Junior Rick James, who saw limited ac-
tion because he was sick, was the Pan-
ther’s only double winner as he took
first place in the 100-yard backstroke
with a time of 0:53.9. He also was a
member of the winning 200—yard
medley team.

Also coming out on top for the Pan-
thers was freshman Dan Langan. He
won his first event of the season with
a strong performance in the 1,000—yard
freestyle.

“I was quite pleased with Dan.“ said
head coach Fred Lewis. "He did a
great job."

The divers also were winners as
junior Jack Shuten took ﬁrst on the one-
meter board and senior Todd Mulzet
finished on top on the three-meter
board.

As I see it

"1 was happy with the meet." Lewis
said. "We had some people out. but
everyone pulled together.“

The Kenyon meet was a challenge
for the Panthers. but they met it head
on. winning 61-50.

Pitt‘s divers dominated both boards
as Mulzet won the one— and three-
meter. His scores of 324.67 on one-
meter and 340.57 on three-meter were
both Kenyon pool records.

The divers took one through five on
both boards. Sophomore Chris Blair
was second on one— and three-meter
with scores of 284.32 and 292.80.
respectively. Shuten took third on the
one-meter with 271.65 points and
fourth on the three-meter with 271.27
points. Freshman Vernon Yenick was
fourth on the one-meter (264.45 points)
and fifth on the three-meter with
276.82 points and fifth on the one—
meter (245.40).

“The divers were a very big factor."
Lewis said. "Todd’s performance was
super. Taking one through five is a big
lift to the team."

James was a force to be reckoned
with in the Kenyon meet also. He took
first place in the 200—yard backstroke
with a 1:59.36, was a member of the
winning 400-yard medley relay team
and was second in the 200—yard in-
dividual medley with a time of 1:58.29.

The Pitt News. February 10. 1986

Senior Donald Martin won the
200—yard breast stroke (His only loss
in four years was caused by illness)
turning in a time of 2: 10.25. He was
also a member of the 400—yard medley
relay team. The other two members of
the relay team were freshman Scott Jef-
fries, who finished second in the
50-yard freestyle with a time of0:22. 12
and the l00—yard'freestyle with a time
of0:47.85, and Jim Emore, who was
also a member of the second—place
400-yard freestyle relay team.

Other top performers for Pitt includ-
ed Martin Durkin, who won the
l.000—yard freestyle in 9:51.32. and
Geoff Rife. who took first in the
50()—yard freestyle with a time of
4:46.56. Charles Lersch was second in
the 500 free with a 4:48.30,and was a
member of the second place 400 free
relay team with Emore, Rob Reddy and
Tom Shaulinski. Junior Frank Williams
took second place in the 200—yard but-
terfly with a time of 1:59.36.

“The guys really came through when
they had to,” Lewis said. “They real-
ly pulled it out — guys like Frank
Williams and Scott Jeffries really came
through for us.”

The Panthers will see action next
when Pitt hosts the Big East Swimm-
ing and Diving Championships on Feb.
19-22 at Trees Pool.

Some news from the boxing world

It’s time once again for the semi-
annual “State of Boxing Address.”

Due to the vast number of talented
young ﬁghters in the world today, box-
ing is on the rise.

One of the most promising of the
young stars will get his chance at star-
dom Thursday night as John “The
Beast” Mugabi tries to wrest the un-
disputed middleweight title from
Marvelous Marvin Hagler.

The heavyweights are back! It
doesn’t matter what they decide to do
with Tim Witherspoon’s title. The
WBA should just let him keep it
because he’11 just lose it in his next ﬁght
anyway. A rematch with WBC champ
Pinklon Thomas is in the works. After
KO’ing Witherspoon, Thomas will
probably fight the winner of the
Michael Spinks—Larry Holmes
rematch.

Despite everything that I said about
Holmes not being in Rocky Marciano’s
class, I still think that Holmes was one
of the all—time greats. Age is a factor.
If Spinks trains as hard as he did for
the first fight, he should win by
unanimous decision. But if he slacks off
just a littlebit, don’t be surprised if
Holmes regains the title.

The future heavy weight title-holder,
Mike Tyson, after KO’ing Jesse
Ferguson, should look to rid the box-
ing world of the two most wasted
talents in the world today — Greg “I
can’t say no to anything edible” Page,
and Gerry “I’m not busy this weekend.
Can I fight for the title?” Cooney.
Tyson would KO Page in 3, and
Cooney in 1. Look for Tony Tucker,
Carl “The Truth” Williams and
Englishman Frank Bruno to make a run
at Tyson during his title reign.

Also, the four Olympians — Tyrell
Biggs, Francesco Damiani, Henry
Tillman and Willie DeWit' — have
shown nothing but promise. And who
is this Dee Collier? I don’t know the
details, but he KO’ed Tex “Iron Jaw”
Cobb in one round!

A lot of people still have no idea that
the I90-lb. cruiserweight division even
exists. If the cruisers are going to get
any recognition, they will have to ar-
range a match between IBF champ Lee
Roy Murphy (a member of the boycott
1980 Olympic team) and WBA champ
Dwight Muhammad Qawi (formerly
Dwight Braxton). Luckily, it looks as
though Evander Holyﬁeld is growing
out of the light heavyweight division.
That's great news for this obscure
division.

When is Marvin Johnson going to be
given a shot at regaining the light
heavyweight crown? It’s a shame about
Eddie Mustafa Muhammad. There was
once so much potential there. He’s got
a few short years left. Maybe he can

straighten himself out for one last shot
at the title.

What about the IBF’s experimental
168—lb. super middleweight division?
Who cares?

Finally, the two best middleweights
in the world (Mugabi and Hagler) will
slug it out. I am anxiously awaiting the
Thomas Hearns—James Shuler bout,
which will take place right before the
Mugabi-Hagler ﬁght. Both should be
classics. I also am anxiously awaiting
a match between Frank Tate and
anybody. This may sound crazy, but
then again we are talking about box-
ing here. How about if Roberto Duran
squares off against the recently-
released Rubin “Hurricane” Carter?
I know, Carter’s in his 40s, but so
what? This would be a classic brawl.

Nothing is better in boxing than a
good middleweight tight.

I don’t think that Donald Cury can
compete with the top middleweights.
He could, however, dominate the
junior middleweights for years. Do you
know who Buster Drayton is? He is a
very gifted boxer who finally decided
to take boxing seriously, and now is
very dangerous because he is far bet-
ter than his record indicates.

Can Milton McCrory regain the ti-
tle, after Curry vacates it, to move on
up in weight? I’d like to see him face
Colin Jones just one more time. Tom-
my Ayers ﬁnally should be awarded his
shot at the title sometime this year. This
year also will mark the rise of Mark
Breland and Shawn O’Sullivan. I‘d like
to see them face each other early next
year.

“Ubaldo Sacco upsets Aaron
Pryor.” Don’t be surprised. Pryor has
been lulled to sleep by too little com-
petition. Sacco, the WBA champ, has
a lot of heart and a solid chin. We could
see it this year. James (Buddy) McGirt
deserves a shot at Lonnie Smith’s WBC
record. All of this may be meaningless
however, because it appears that
Meldrick Taylor is heading for this
division. I personally feel that Taylor
is the best of the Olympians.

There is currently more attention
focused on the lightweights than on any
other division, and rightly so! This
division is loaded! While Hector
“Macho” Camacho is making all of
the headlines, I’m not so sure that the
weak-chinned champ is as good as
advertised. There was something
wrong with Jose Luis Ramirez on the
night that he lost to Camacho. Rest
assured, Ramirez will be back. Ex-
champ Edwin Rosario apparently is
back. He recently knocked out tough
Roque Montoya with a body shot! I’d
like to see Rosario get a shot at IBF
champ Jimmy Paul (the best of the
three champs). I’d also like to see

veteran Cornelius Boza-Edwards go
after Camacho‘s WBC title. Boza-
Edwards has too much heart for
Camacho. The upcoming WBA title
fight between champ Livingstone
Bramble and Tyrone “Butterfly"
Crawley should prove exciting. I say:
Crawley by a split decision. Olympic
champ Pernell Whitaker will have a
tough time in this talent-laden division,
but he has the talent to go far. How bad
does he want it?

Ready for a shocker? Two years
from now, the dominant lightweight in
the world will be WBC junior
lightweight champ Julio Cesar Chavez.
I love watching him ﬁght! Chavez
reminds me of a scaled-down Carlos
Monzon. He has no competition in his
division. WBA champ Wilfredo
Gomez should “hang ’em up.” It ap-
pears that ex-champ Bobby Chacon
already has. Chacon was one of my all-
time favorites. He had more heart than
Rocky Balboa. Rocky Lockridge and
Roger Mayweather eventually will rule
the division.

The junior featherweights are thin on
talent. The only really interesting fight
would be a rematch between Juan “The
Kid” Mesa and Jaime Garza.

I’d like to leave you with one
thought. Anyone who knows boxing
knows that “height advantage” is a
myth. The shorter man has the advan-
tage, because he can go to the body
easier and he can tuck his chin in away
from his opponent. People are mislead
because the taller ﬁghter usually has the
longer reach. But a reach advantage —
unless it's 5 inches or more — doesn’t
really mean that much against a
talented short fighter. This is yet
another reason why 5-ll Mike Tyson
is such a promising prospect.

Lady Panthers fall
to Boston College

The Pitt Lady Panthers continued to
struggle in Big East competition, los-
ing to Boston College 71-57 at Chestnut
Hill on Saturday.

The loss, Pitt’s fourth in its last nine
conference games, dropped the Lady
Panthers to 9-12 overall and 4-8 in the
Big East. Boston College improved its
record to 12-10 overall and 6-6 in the
Big East.

The Lady Panthers return home to
host the Syracuse Orangewomen on
Wednesday evening at the ﬁeld house.
Game time is 7:30 p.m.
