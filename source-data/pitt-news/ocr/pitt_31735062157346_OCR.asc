Eighth Floor Devotees
To Get Lounge ‘Soon’

Men’s Council is making real progress on its proposed Men’s
Lounge, according to Don Milletary, head of the committee in

charge of the project.

Although he would not commit himself on a definite opening

date for the lounge,Milletary stated
that he "hoped” it would be ready
next semester.

Milletary’s Facilities Committee
has drawn up tenative plans for
the developing of room 817 CI. into
a place where students can relax,
play ping-pong or shuffle board or
just loaf.

The present arrange'ment calls
for three ping-pong tables in one
end of the room and two shuffle
board areas at the other end. In the
middle of the floor in a semi-circle
will be the lounge furniture.

The committee is being aided in
the pricing and selection of furni-
ture by W. H. Strycker, University
purchasing agent.

In any event the lounge will
operate only until 3 p.m. each day.
MC has the room reserved until
this time every day, but after that
they must vacate the room in favor
of the bands and other instrumental
groups.

Finances for the‘ project are com,-
ing from MC Bookstore receipts
and a $500 appropriation from the
Board of Trustees "that can be
used for the lounge” according to
Roy Titchworth, president

iston, S.C., in 1936.

Drink_ Ban

Remains In

Talk Stage

B)’ JAY AUSLANDER

' ‘Nothing new yet.”

That was the report’ of the
University Senate’s Committee
on Student Relations, following
a full meeting’s discussion Fri-
day on Student Congress’ almost
forgotten stadium drinking ban.

The booze ban was first pro-
posed by Andy Schurman and his
Decorum Committee more than six
weeks ago.

“We hope students aren't accus-
ing us of ‘passing the buck’ with
Student Congress’ drinking ban,”
Dr. Theodore W. Finney, chairman
of the student relations committee,
said in stating the views of the
fourth University group to discuss
the issue.

Advisory Powers Only

“But as a committee of the Uni-
versity Senate,” Dr. Finney con-
tinued, ,“we perform only certain
functions, and we are actually with-
out power to act alone on such a
seemingly important matter.”

“Our committee can only study
the issue and submit a report to
the executive committee, which,
committee, which, in turn, will re-
view our report and decide about
placing it on the agenda at the Feb.
16 Senate meeting, Dr. Finney said.

"For our second meeting on the
problem this Friday, we have in-
vited two school representatives --
one a member of the administration
and one a member of the student
body to discuss the drinking
ban with us, and help us to fonn
an opinion, he concluded.

The Student Congress drinking
ban came originally as the result
of a note sent early in October to
SC Decorum Committee chairman
Andy Schurman, by Capt. Tom
Hamilton, athletic director. Capt.
Hamilton suggested “drinking and
towdyism” during football games
should be dealt with at once.

stringent Rules Urged

Student Congress, crying for ac-
tion, submitted a letter to the Uni-
versity Senate executive committee
stating: "We are opposed to the
use of intoxicating beverages in
the stadium, and we strongly re-
commend that the Senate take ap-
propriate action to protect its stu-
dents from the unwarranted con-
duct of an inconsiderate minority.”

The University Senate, at its
NOV. 10 session read the SC let-
ter and, referred the plea to Dr.
Finney’s committee on student
relations.

Arrival Of Top Men
Places Psych Center ,

Among Nation’s Best

One of the world's finest psychiatric and mental health cen-
ters, headed by three of the nation’s top men in the field, will be’
established at the University’s Western Psychiatric Institute and
and Clinic, Alan M. Scaife, president of the Board of Trustees,

announced today.

The institute, built by the state eight years ago, was taken
over by the University in 1949. The University is expanding the

program of the institute to include
diagnosis, prevention and treatment
of mental diseases.

The three man team which will
head the Institute are Dr. Henry W.
Brosin, Dr. Benjamin Spock and
Dr. I. Arthur Mirsky.

[lead Hails from Chicago

Dr. Brosin has been named medi-
cal director of the Institute. He will
also head the department of psych-
iatry in the School of Medicine.

Dr. Brosin will begin his work
here January 1, 1951. He is pre-
sently professor of psychiatry and
head of the division of psychiatry at
the University of Chicago medical
school. '

Dr. Spock is scheduled to arrive
in Pittsburgh July 1. Slated to be
professor of child development, he
is considered an authority on child
development and preventive mental
hygiene, and comes here from the
Mayo Clinic and the University of
Minnesota. _

The research division of the In-
stitute will be headed by Dr. Mirsky.

The aim of the division

»He is now associate professor of
experimental medicine in psychiatry
at the University of Cincinnati’s
School of Medicine and director of
the May Institute.

In announcing the appointments,
Mr’. Scaife said, "This is without a
doubt the finest psychiatric team in
America. The University and the
community will be greatly enriched
by the presence of these outstand-t
ing men of science in Pittsburgh.

The new program was made POS-
sible by an agreement between the
University, the State and the Falk
foundation.

The program is expected to cost
approximately $1,650,000 a year.

day, unanimously overruled the recommendation of Upperclas‘s
Court that no Panther keys be awarded to freshmen this semester.

The coveted keys were issued
to 95 freshman who made a 69% or

"Ok, men-----watch out for o nekked reverse!”

---by BIBL ER

Overset

«By DAVE WINTER

Commons Room Council is trying earnestly to dump a load of
litter in the laps of Men’s Council and the women’s WSGA Com-
mission. These two student governing bodies are scrambling out
of the way to avoid the job of enforcing fines for students who
leave coats, lunches or books in the Commons Room.

Now Ihold no grudge against CRC
spokesman Claire Zeligman or the
rest of the young ladies practising
the gentle art of being gracious hos-
tesses. Ordinarily they suit me to a
tea, though I wish they’d serve
cookies more often.

The point is that hostesses don’t
usually make guests pay , to get
their coats out of hock before they
can go home.

Locker Shortage Cited
If the big three-story chamber has
a bit too much of that “lived-in”
look, it's due more to shortage of
locker space and check room facili-
ties than to student attitudes.
Miss Zeligman’s original com-

thing

plaint to us was about the mess
created by copies of the News left
helter-skelter on tables, chairs and
floors.

This will be sacriligious, since
the ink on those papers is the life
blood of the staff, but I suggest that
CRC solve their big problem by pro-
curing a few waste-baskets for dis-
carded newspapers and,I hesitate to
admit, other refuse.

Let hostesses suggest gently to
students that they should check
coats when possible, and CRC will
havea sure cure for that old malady,
indigestion caused by biting off
more than you can chew. The first
that

‘ and if they postpone the caseayear
should be dropped into ,

that waste-basket is the plan for
fines —- quietly, quickly, withno fuss.

Lunches and books on the table
while owners stray away? So what!
The Pitt Compass has called the
Commons Room "heart of University
life” and "center of student social,
life.” Students want it that way.
They don’t want it to beaspit-and-
polish parlor like great grandma's,
opened only for scrubbing, clea-ning,
funerals or marriages.

low the surface thoughts of math 21 and psych 61 for the more
alluring prospects of roast turkey, cranberry sauce and sleeping
until twelve. And no doubt everyone is also mapping plans for
how he will utilize his time at home after the turkey has been con-
sumed.

So at this point in the school year, we’d like to look back on
the past six weeks, sum up, approve and disapprove.

Student Congress came out against drinking as have so many
others in the past. To date nothing has happened, nor does it
seem likely that anything will happen. About the only result of
the proposed ban has been that most students are a little more
furtive about taking a nip up at the stadium.

The drive to send the band to Notre Dame was successful.
Its SLlCCCSs was a tribute to the student body and especially to
IF Council. ,

A more recent drive has had less success. We hope that its
progress remains at the same low level. We are, of course, re-
ferring to the drive, or plot, to clean-up the Commons. The only
result of such a drive, we feel, will be to make the Commons
Room less inhabitable for the students. I ‘

Discrimination didn’t rear its head on this campus, but dis-
crimination on another campus was felt by the members of a fra-
issue nothing much has happen-
ed here. _But there are rumors that discrimination is a problem for
many in the student body. ‘We refer to reports that the Medical
School has religious as well as racial quotas.

The draft swelled the ranks of the ROTC this fall providing
us with a larger group of recruits to watch perform antics on the
lawn.,Significantly, many veterans who had sworn they were
heading for the hills at the first sign of another draft, wound up

' doing left flanks on the grass.

The news strike in the city brought with it the knowledge that
there are other newspapers in the country. The strike also made
it possible for Len Casanova’s team to go through its infancy
with a minimum of advice, explanations and criticisms from the
downtown experts. .

Now that we have rapidly summed up the past six weeks,
we’d like to ‘make a prediction. Few if any students will keep
those resolutions they are now making: they won’t study.

The Year of the Oath

By JACK MARKOWITZ

Communism allegedly is rearing its head in every important
phase of American life -- government, entertainment, labor,

educ ation.

The non-Communist oath offers,to some people, a hope of
destroying the Red threat, especially in the field of college edu-

cation.

I Exchange l
By LOIS FOIGHT

I am taking my eyes from the
pile of exchange papers for a
look at what’s happening close,
to home -- and I find an insigni-
ficant point, overlooked _up until
now, which may potentially affect
every woman in the University.

The oversight concerns a Christ-
mas Dance held in the Commons
Room.

Beginning last fall with
suggestion of Dick Kovar,
junior representative to Student
Congress, agitation for an all
school dance among the four-story
arches has become stronger and
stronger. »

the
then

Obvious Advantages

The advantages were so obvious
that student sentiment rapidly ap-
proved the idea. The economy of
the plan came first. It’s simplicity
was hard to believe -- no rent!

With this fact as a starting
point, there was no limit to the
imaginative flights of the pro-
po'sal’s backers. Corners would be
green with gayly lighted Christmas
trees, their aromatic fragrance
mingling with the woodsmoke from
roaring Yule logs.

From the Bellefield dais would
ascend the slow strains of two-step
or fox trot, curling through arch-
ways and floating above, to blend
finally with the beauty of the
arched ceiling.

All this sounds fine. Besides,
it is by Pitt, of Pitt, at Pitt, and
for the dance lo_ving members of
the "University family.”

If the administration would give
its approval to the idea, the Christ-
mas dance at Pitt might become
nationally known.

I
On The Other Hand

BUT, with a peep beneath the
surface, we find the fly that has
been overlooked in pouring out
such a well mixed offering.

The floor of the Commons Room
is, to quote the Vade Mecum,
"green slate.” And green slate is,
to quote the women who.,.have act-
ed as hostesses for open houses,
receptions, and ceremonies,
“mighty uncomfortable.”

The proximity of high heeled
dancing slippers and hard slate,‘
no matter how aesthetically beauti-
ful a sight, has a very undesirable
affect on the arches. To be _per-
fectly frank, it makes your feet
hurt, ladies.

Therefore, though in theory I
back the student viewpoint, on be-
half of my foot-loose and callous-'
free generation, I am inclined to
agree with the administration's
argument, that the Commons Room
was not built for dancing.

 

9

Last year the University of Cali-
fornia served as the first major
guinea pig for the oath experiment.

The Year of the Oath began when
the California Board of Regents,
ordered that henceforth a require-
ment for employment on the faculty
would be the swearing of an oath
of non-membership in the Com-
munist Party. ‘

The Year ended when the faculty
had conceded such large sections
of academic freedom and personal
dignity that the Board of Regents,
satisfied with faculty "loyalty',”
agreed to “rescind” the oath
(actually to merely dilute it.)

The story of the oath contro-
versy, as dramatic a story as any
that has ever unfolded on a univer-
sity campus, has been authorita-
tively and absorbingly recounted
in "The Year of the Oath,” by
George R. tewart and other pro-
fessors of the University of Cali-
fornia.

Faculty Indignont

The authors record that when
the oath was first proposed,
faculty reaction was one ,of in-
dignation and solidarity against
the new requirement, but hardly
one of fear - an emotion that was
rapidly to gain ground later.

Here in the beginning the faculty
could list many arguments - high-
sounding, idealistic reasons why
the oath should not be required.
“Political test,” "guilt by asso-
ciation,” "affront to my loyalty
and dignity,” "knife at my throat,”
said many a professor mindful of
academic ideals.

But, the authors record, gra-
dually and inevitably, the faculty
‘lost ground. Pressure was applied.
First, it was the fact that only
signers of oath (some 11 per cent
at the beginning) were receiving
their contracts. Faced with the
possibility of being out of a job,
marginal faculty members, espe-
cially older ones, fearful of not
being able to get a post at another
school, fell into line.

As the Year wore on, the ranks,
and consequently the strength of
the non-signers waned. They com-

' promised.

Idea is Not U nscathed

At the end of the Year, confront-

ed with a "sign-or-get-out ulti-y
matum,” they had agreed to con-
cessions unthought of at the begin-
ning.

First, they agreed to the inclu-
sion in their yearly contracts of a
statement of University policy re-
pudiating membership in the Com-
munist party. Signing of the con-
tract now meant acceptance of that
policy, if not actually ‘swearing to
non-membership in the P arty.

The second fundamental coir-‘I
cession was acceptance by the
faculty of the doctrine that "proven
members of the Communist Party,
by reason of such commitment to
the Party, are not acceptable as
members of the faculty.”

It is only fair to say that this
compromise was not supported by
all. Twenty-five per cent of the
faculty ‘voted against the second 3
concession; some faculty mem- 3
bars resigned when that became I
university policy. e

Faculty Under Pressure

But in spite of the fact that some
members of the faculty held to their
ideals throughout the year, the
great majority did not, could not.

In fact, the book’s most eye- a
opening element is the year-long A

grinding down of the faculty. Not 
to mention the inevitably resultant 

damage to the University.

A major conclusion of
authors: “Almost everyone will
agree . . . that the University is a
less well-functioning institution, a
less happy and creative place than ,
it was a year ago.”

Another conclusion: Assuming
the continuance of the conflict
between the United States and
Russia, the_ American people wild
find themselves called upon more
and more to evaluate Communism’s
threat to the American way of life,
and, just important, to defend civil
and academic liberties against’
dangerous solutions to the Com-
munist threat, as well as against
the threat itself.

“The Year of the Oath" is an
exhaustive evaluation of that threat
on University campuses.

As such, it is a very important;

book.

Readable, too. Professor Ste-

wart and his associates know how j

to write a book.

DISCARDS from

the Sports Shuffle

 

By STAN SKIRBOLL

Last week on these very same pages, the Pitt News said that the
Panther line “could be the determining factor in the Michigan State

game.”

While we do not want to take the
"We-told-you-so” attitude, it was a
very disappointing forward wall

that permitted the Spartans to
continually rush and harrass
Quarterback Bob Bestwick and

Bob Osterhout.

Not all of the 14 times that
Bestwick was thrown for losses,
could the fault be laid to the line,
however. Bestwick seemed to he-
sitate more and seemed to lack
the confidence that sparked his
record-breaking performance
against Notre Dame last week.

But the question, once again,
is what happened to the line‘? Not
only was there something lacking,
in the State game. but also during
the entire season the forward
wall has been without the drive,
spirit, and bone-crushing tackling
and blocking of last year.

Could the answer be that Coach
Len Casanova and his aides are
too nice‘?

Earlier in the season, one of the
yeteran Pitt lineman was asked
where the old power and drive was.
He answered that definitely "some-
thing was missing.” i

“The boys would do anything
for Cas,” he said, "but maybe we

are too used to being driven and
chewed out.”

Although the late. Dr. Jock

Customarily known as the press
‘ box, the Menagerie each week
houses behind its glass enclosure
several score sports writers at
whom the general public is permitted
to peer but not feed.

Thus, at the end of the Mena-
gerie’s 26th season, Keeper
Carver looks back with nostalgia

over his many years with the strange
creatures.

For instance, there was the time
back in 1931 when« Sports Editor
Harry Keck of The Sun-Telegraph

Sutherland and ex-coach Mike
Milligan were never loved by their
players, they got results with their
driving tactics.

By the way, you can be sure
that Frosh Coach John Chicker-
neo didn't ease up between
halves at Bridgeville last Fri-
,day night, when his boys came
into the locker room two touch-
downs behind.

The fmsh came out fuming to
rack up 15 points in the second
half.

Saturday when Halfback Bill
Carey whipped one to End Bob

the twins had pulled the brother
act this year.

About a half hour after the game,
Casanova was seen leaving Gate 3
of the Stadium with a suitcase,
which prompted one observer to re-
mark: “Are things that tough with
Cas?”

Panthers Face Repeat

Of Dismal ’47 Record

By WILL DOERGE
Pitt’s Panthers are faced with the gloomy prospect of equal-

- ing their 1-8 record of 1947 if they are unable to get by Penn

State at the Stadium Saturday.
Michigan State’s powerful Spartans hung the seventh loss of
the season on Len Casanova’s eleven last Saturday, 19-0, as the
Panthers couldn’t get their passing attack clicking as it did
against Notre Dame. ‘

Pitt is a slight 6 point favorite ‘ "' "
over Penn State. A crowd of 30,000 ‘
is expected for the final game of
the season.

Both Whipped Mounties

Against a common foe this season,
West Virginia, both State and Pitt
have had an easy time. The Lions
beat the Mountaineers, 27-0, while
the Panthers beat them in the mud
for their only victory, 21-7.

“T” Quarterback Vince O’Bara of
Johnstown is the spearhead of the
¢ State attack. Although Coach Rip
L Engle’s team'has emphasized a
3 running game this season, O’Bara’s
’ passes have played a maior part in
State Victories. Vince,_incidentally,
is the brother of Pitt halfback, Joe
O’Bara.

Passing Duel?

Saturday's battle could well be a
passing battle between State’s
O’Bara and Pitt's Bob Bestwick.

Pitt opponents have gained at
will via the forward pass. Even
Michigan State, with its crushing
running attack, resorted to the pass
for two of its scores.

Opponents have gained llllyards
by passing while Pitt aerials have
accounted for 860 yards. To break

Freshmen Unimaginafhre

_But Good

By MYRON KOPELMAN
Sports Editor

Our misfortunes are forever with us, but the good things in
life are constantly in danger of being whisked away from our

grasp.

The above generalization cannot
be charged to any wizened philo-
sophers of days gone by. It is,
rather, a profound observation re-
gistered in a moment of cynicism
by Aristotle Kopelman, 1950 A.D.

In other words, here is Pitt,
finally, with a freshman football
team that has conquered every-
thing in sight. Yet in front of every
post office looms the gentleman
with whiskers, ominously pointing
his finger at America’s young men,
halfbacks no exceptions.

Lessons Reioicing

His warning kind of takes the
zip out of any rejoicing which
could have been carried out in the
wake of the freshmen’s 22-19 vic-
tory over previously unbeaten West
Virginia Friday night.

Although miserable in the first
half, Coach Johnny Chickerneo’s
boys straightened out in the second
portion, thus forcing a number of
conclusions:

I -- Halfback Lou Cimarolli has
it. He weighs only 170 or there-
abouts, but his legs are thick and
strong, the sign of a good back.

2 -- Fullback Bobby Epps, who
runs low to the ground like he is
riding a bicycle, may cross a lot
of goal lines before he is done.

3 - Quarterback Manual Campa
is a precociou'sly smooth ball-

andler, although his passing
ability has yet to be determined. _

4 -- Tackle John Reger, well
over 200 pounds, can bust through

S -- The graduation of Automatic
Nick Bolkovac will not be sorely
felt in the place-kicking depart-

ment, as frosh halfback Art Di-
Giovanni kicks to; the goal line

Future Promising

With these points
would seem that
need not start gazing off high-
level bridges as yet, for good
things may be in store for him.
True, the freshmen’s attack Fri-
day night was particularly un-
imaginative, but you cannot re-
quire perfection from first—year

The natural ability was there,
and that is the main thing. i

Chickerneo has made splendid
progress in developing that ability,
although there is still a great deal
to be done. In their present state,
however, the frosh are not bad

BULLETIN!

The Faculty Diehards edged
the OiIers,13°7.yesterday at
Schenley Oval, eliminating the
losers from the intramural play-
offs.

By BOB GOLLINGS

The interfraternity football
-champions were crowned on Friday,
as Delta Tau Delta shut out Pi
Kappa Alpha, 13-0, to take 40
points in the race for the IF trophy.

The Delts had mastery over most
of the game, and seemed to adapt
to the muddy field better than did
the PiKA’s,as they scored both of
their touchdowns on running plays.

Speedster Kent Thorpe took a
punt return the length of the field
for the initial Delt score, providing
the standout play of the game.

An interception brought the sec-
ond TD, with Cliff Hargest going
40 yards.

The Delts now move into the
semi-finals in intramural competi-
tion, fighting for the all-campus
championship.

Phi Epsilon Pi nosed out Sigma

to be a passing battle, all the scor-
ing coming through the air route.

end; likewise winning streaks must
go by the boards. West Virginia had
its four game victory skein interrup-
ted, but Pitt’s three game string was
almost broken in the process.

Pitt scored first early in the first
quarter. Right end Joe Zombek
blocked a Mountaineer punt on the
West Virginia 44-yard line and raced
to the 3 yard line. After two tries
Bobby Epps carried over for the
touchdown. Art DiGiovanni tacked
on the extra point by placement and
Pitt led, 7-0.

Mountaineers Roll

Then West Virginia started to
click. A sustained drive was cli-
maxed by a 15-yard touchdown pass
from Jack Stone to Dick Luciani,
Soon after, Stone carried over from
the 1-yard line for the Mountaineers’
second score. 1

In the second quarter Stone gal-
loped 20 yards for another Moun-
taineer touchdown. This ended the
first half scoring with West Virginia
on top 19-7 and the Pantherslooking
to be sure losers.

‘Greek Ball ’ To Feature
‘Big Name ’Bandleader

Elliot Lawrence and his orch-
estra, winners of the Billboard
Magazine Campus Poll for the third
consecutive year, will hold the
feature slot at Inter-Fraternity
Council’s winter formal, "The
Greek Ball," on Friday, Dec. 1, in
the William Penn Hotel.

Only 25 years old, Lawrence is
the nation's youngest name band
leader. In the space of five years
the Lawrence band has taken its

place in the field of name bands.

The band has played dances
at some 300 major institutions in-
cluding all the Big Ten schools,
all the Ivy League schools and
practically every state university
and college.

Rosalind Patton and Danny Ric-
cardo are the featured vocalists
with the orchestra. Miss Patton,
has been singing with Lawrence
aggregations since he organized his
first outfit in high'school.'

Riccardo has been with Lawrence
for only a short time but he has had
considerable professional exper-
ience.

Another Elliott will also be fea-
tured at the dance. Baron Elliott and
his orchestra will play for the danc-
ers in the Urban Room of theWilliam
Penn.

Because the funds alloted for
them were donated to the “Send-
The-Band-To-Notre Dame” drive,
favors will be missing.
