Sailing club
rocks SGB’s
boat with
Allocations
request

Szfryf Writers

After three years of discussion and Alloca-
tions forms, the Pitt Sailing Club ﬁnally has
its own ﬂeet.

Senior neuroscience and philosophy
major Vincent Mattiola created the sailing
club in November 2011 with the donation
of a single Hobie 16 sailboat. Since then,
club members have lobbied for SGB to fund
the purchase of additional sailboats so they
would be able to train competitively and
be able to have more members sail. After
multiple rejections from the SGB, the Board
agreed on Oct. 1 to give $26,770.10 to Pitt
Sailing to purchase six used sailboats from
Connecticut College, which is located in New
London, Conn.

A new issue has now arisen about the
process of funding additional requests and
who holds the purse strings at SGB, more
so than it is about the sailing club and its
hefty expenses. A -

Tense discussion began between the
Board and the Allocations Committee when
Mattiola came before the board during the

Over the last century, couples have increas-
ingly had children out of wedlock. Unfortu-
nately, this also means that more teenage
mothers are raising children on their own
or struggling to raise children without tra-
ditional family support. 1 -

But physician Jeannette South-Paul

found a remedy to this modern problem
in an old source: an indigenous culture of
southern Africa.

According to the U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services, Pennsylvania
was ranked 38th in the country for the high-
est teen birth rates among young women
age 15 to 19 years old. In 2011, 10,816 wom-
en between 15 and 19 years old gave birth
in Pennsylvania, while a total of 392,772

Paul’s Maikuru Program, which is focused
onpreventing second unwanted teen preg-
nancies of women younger than 19 years
old.

ALLOCATIONSI

Board’s public meeting on Oct. 15, asking for
$3,173.04 in additional funding. The club
needed the additional funding to purchase a
trailer for $2,400,one rack for the trailer for
$300 and pads for the rack for $473.04. In-
stead of submitting a single request, the club
president submitted allocations forms for-
the items separately, which is the incorrect
procedure. As described in the Allocations
Manual, which prescribes the process for
awarding funds to student organizations, all

three items should have been submitted as a ‘

single request. When submitted separately,
the requests for the rack and pads were for
amounts less than $500, changing how they
were evaluated. ._ '

Any request less then $500 does not go
to the Board for consideration but to the
Allocations Committee, which then has the
ﬁnal say on whether to grant the funds.

The committee recommended that
the Board deny all three requests because
the club had been already been allocated
$29,170.10, which Allocations Committee
Chairman Alexander Majchrzak said is far
more money than the usual amount allo-

cated to a student organization.

The Board did not vote in line with the
committee’s recommendation and members
of the Board disapprovedpf the commit-
tee’s ruling on the requests for ﬁinding to
purchase the two racks.

“In some cases recently, we have seen
the Board overstepping their boundaries,”
said Maj chrzak.

I He added that he wanted to be sure the
Board respected his committee’s recom-
mendations.

Majchrzak said he met with the Board
last week to discuss the denied requests.
After discussion, it was decided that the Al-
locations Committee would vote on whether
or not they will allow the club to withdraw
the original two requests. The club would
then resubmit the requests for the racks
and pads as one request to make it total

‘more than $500, therefore falling under

thejurisdiction of the Board. .

The Allocations Committee decided on
Thursday after its regular meeting that they
would not allow the club to withdraw the re-
quest. According to the Allocations Manual,
clubs are not allowed to submit requests
twice, and the Pitt Sailing Club will be unable
to reapply for funding forthe racks and pads.

Prior to the decision, Majchrzak said

the degree to which the Allocations Manual
and the Board’s constitution are regarded
as rules, rather than simply recommenda-

tions, affects how the Board handles errors

in requests.

Maj chrzak said he was pleased that the
Board respected his committee’s role in de-
ciding what cases his committee chooses
to hear. .

The committee originally recommended

that the Board deny all three requests be— ,
cause the club had already been given far l

more money than the usual amount allo-
cated to a student organization.

“It was my mistake. The form was kind
of misleading to me, and I thought that I was
supposed to submit them in three separate
documents,” Mattiola said. “I really wouldn’t

like the club to take the [brunt] of the force

of mygmistake.”

Because Mattiola said that the three re-
quests were supposed to be combined, Board
member David Rosenthal said he believes

the Board should work with the club to get

the additional funding.

“I don’t think that we should be giving
these people boats and not be giving them
the means to transfer them and to carry
them, because that’s just a shoddy invest-
ment on our part,” Rosenthal said.

,” published on Monday, Oct. 21, the writer reported that her southwestern

Majchrzak said he felt that the Board was
not respecting his committee’s decision.

f‘I think the [allocations] process was
designed to have the Board be allowed to
break rules to help groups, but also there
is an implied respect the Board should have
for committees, and that part this year is a
little lost,” he said.

Majchrzak said a club sport such as the
Pitt Sailing Club usually receives about
$5,000 a semester and receives about
$7,000 to $9,000 if the team advances to
national competitions. Non-sporting clubs
such as service and social groups receive
between $2,000 and $5,000 a semester,
depending on if they send members to con-

’ ferences.

V Majchrzak said only about seven or eight
other student organizations have received
similar amounts of funding to what the Pit
Sailing Club has been granted.

The majority of these clubs are large or-
ganizations that operate under the Office
of Student Affairs andlreceive designated

. amounts of funding each year, such as the

Pitt Program Council and the University
yearbook, Panther Prints.

PREGNANCY

Family Medicine in Pitt’s School of Medi-
cine. She founded the Maikuru Program,
a mentoring program for teen mothers,
four years ago. '

She said she wanted to do something to
help teen moms while she worked in ma-
ternity care with pregnant teens. Between
60 and 80 women have participated in the
program. Those accepted to participate are
teenagers younger than 19 with only one
child, as the goal is to prevent a“ second
unplanned pregnancy. ‘

“These young women’s lives have been
irrevocably changed,” South—Paul said
about her time in maternity care. “So I
thought maybe we could set up a program
that could address multiple issues, and
that’s how I envisioned the program.”

The term “maikuru” comes from the

Shona language, which is spoken in Zim-
babwe and some neighboring countries.
South-Paul, whose husband is Shona, said
she chose this term for the title of the pro-
gram because in Shona culture, a maikuru is
a wise woman and the anchor of her village.

South—Paul said she started the program
because she believes that modern society
has lost the cohesiveness of villages.

She noticed that teenage mothers often
don’t have close relationships with an older
individual, and she decided to pair them
with older women who could support them
and serve as parental ﬁgures and advisers.

South—Paul calls her program’s volunteer
mentors “maikurus.”

She realized it was difficult to encourage
sizeable groups of young women to leave
their home neighborhoods, and decided
a central location for the program would
prove most convenient. “So that’s when we

' said, ‘Let’s just see what happensifwe try

it in Oakland,’’’ she said. “And that became

- a winner. It’s a neutral zone. People feel

comfortable coming to Oakland, and all
the busescome here, which solved a lot of
problems.” -

Each group study consists of six weekly
group sessions held in the Department of
Family Medicine’s building on Fifth Avenue.
The pairs of mothers and mentors come
in once every three months for follow-up
surveys for 24 months. The program has
had 12 participating groups so far.

One student who has become increas-
ingly involved in the program is Kelsey
Moyer, ajunior majoring in biology in the
pre-physician’s-assistant program. She
started working with the study her ﬁrst
year at Pitt through the First Experiences
in Research program run by the Dietrich
School of Arts and Sciences, which offers
freshmen and sophomores the opportu-

nity to become involved in faculty research V

projects in the social sciences, humanities
or natural sciences.

“It’s interesting because you get to actu-
ally interact with people,” Moyer said. “A lot
of it is phone calls, tracking people ‘down
and running group sessions.”

Moyer works with graduate students
part time on the research project. '

“It’s a really cool experience,” she said.
“It’s cool to work alongside doctors and
researchers in that atmosphere.”

When the participating young women
started talking at the beginning of the pro-
gram, the mentors and facilitators realized
there were issues in the mothers’ lives that
theprogram managers did not know about.

» One signiﬁcant issue was domestic vio-
lence. Now, in addition to discussing this

topic in group sessions, an instructorfrom a .

women’s shelter comes to each group meet-

. ing and informs the teens on what abuse is.

COLUMN-

Corporatization of America's universities

kills intrinsic value of education

Nick Voutsinos
Columnist

The problem with American edu-
cation decades ago was that it was
not available to everyone. Legacies
had a greater chance of getting into
a school than non—legacies, and
whites had a better chance than
most racial minorities. Despite
that, universities cost students

’ much less than they do today.

Nowadays, everyone is legally
able to attend a university, but not
everyone can afford it. As student
loan rates continue to rise, it is
now the norm for crippling debt to
come alongside a college diploma,
thus making easy access to higher
education more of a privilege than
a right.

This is unfortunate for many,
considering the pressing demands

of the job market for a more spe-p
pcialized and educated workforce.

This corporatization of higher edu-
cation has led to much competition
among universities to create avery
elitist learning environment.

We see this in U.S. News 8zWOI‘l(l
Report’s annual “Best Colleges”
guide. One of the easiest ways for
universities to earn elite status is
by rejecting more applicants than
other “middle tier” schools. After
all, going to asuper selective school

like Harvard, which only accepts

5.8 percent of its applicants, makes
a resume much more attractive
than going to a state school. So the
pressure for applicants to appear as
“ ' ed”aspossible is tremendous.

The problem with this is that
more often than not, gifted stu-
dents tend to be more privileged
than non—gifted students. At the

most renowned universities in the
country, 74 percent of the student

. “body comes from the top quarter

of the socioeconomic spectrum,
while only 3 percent comes from
the bottom quarter.

This could be due to the fact

that appearing gifted is much eas-

ier to do with money and because
of the speciﬁc traits universities
want from their applicants. Parents
need to invest a lot in their children
in order to make them more at-
tractive to colleges. Whether their
money is spent on tutors or extra-
curriculars such as sports, parents
are dropping a ton of cash on their
kids. So it only makes sense that
the applicant who was on the best
club sport team and who had a
great private tutor will have a more
attractive application.

VOUTSINOS .

SAT scores also translate into money. More
often than not, the student whose parents
could afford to pay for an SAT prep class will
end up havingbetter scores than the student
who could not afford it. According _to an
article from The New York Times, there is
a “very strong positive correlationbetween
income and test scores.” So generally speak-
ing, the higher the income bracket in which
the student sits, the higher his or her test

scores will be. Of course, these kids have
more of a chance getting into prestigious
universities, but considering how expensive
they are, it seems as though they are the
only ones who could afford them, anyway.

Frankly, the corporatization of universi- _

ties is only advantageous to the top-level
administrators, who tend to haveincomes
in the millions, for colleges have changed
tremendously over the years to favor admin-
istration over education. In fact, from 1998
to 2008, private colleges increased spending
22 percent on curriculum, while increasing

7 spending on administration by 36 percent.

As a result, Universities now come with
huge administrative bureaucracies. For in-
stance, in the last 40 years, the number of
administrative staffers has risen dramati-
.cally by 240 percent.

This creates a very dehumanizing effect,
as there is now a great number of people
between the students and administrators.
It is very diﬂicult for top-level administra-
tors to relate to their students when only
the lower—level faculty, such as teaching as-
sistants, have constant contact with them.

‘the lower—level faculty really does not
have much of a voice when it comes to uni-

versity decisions, . which may explain why
university board members continue to raise
prices and ﬁind certain programs against
student wishes. . _

So if the American education system ever
wants to restore its ‘reputation, it needs to
focus more on the-students and less on the
proﬁts. Every high school graduate deserves
an equal chance at getting into college, and
every college student needs to have a voice.
Those are the ﬁrst steps toward making the
U.S. education system more fair and demo-
cratic. Q I .’ '

Netﬂix
breathes new
life into TV

Shawn Cooke
Stqff Wrz'ter

From its title, “Orange Is the New Black”
sounds like a hot new TLC reality program A
that urges viewers to “say yes to the jumpsuit.”
Lucky for the highbrow television viewer, its
title is more than a little deceiving.

Netflix rolled out all 13 episodes of the
show’s excellent first season fromjenji Kohan,
the creator of Weeds, back injuly Based on
Piper Kerman’s memoir of the same name,
the series focuses on a woman imprisoned
for transporting drug money 10 years after
the crime was committed. Set in a women’s
correctional facility, “Orange” postures itself
as a refreshing alternative in an industry domi-
nated by male protagonists — particularly
among prison dramas.

Netﬂix has been credited with giving its
showrunners almost total creative control,
including the freedom to lace episodes with
as many profanities and exposed bodies as
they wish. Although “Orange” can often give

Judd Apatowﬁlms a crass runfor their money,
granting the opportunity to craft a show this
diverse and female-driven was a far riskier
enterprise for Netflix. Given the adjusted pa-
rameters for success on a streaming service ‘V
relative to network or even cable channels,
Netﬂix was able to take a chance on Kohan’s
daring content in a way that more viewer-
conscious providers would be unable to do.

Last Tuesday night, one of the show’s writ-
ers, Pittsburgh native Lauren Morelli, spoke at
Belleﬁeld Hall about grovvingup on the North
Shore, her time studying dance in college and
how she decided to pursue televisionwriting.
Morelli also touched on the show’s empower-
ing nature, which makes it unlike anything
else on television or the Internet right now.

GALLERY FEATURE

Alien She looks to riot grrrl’s past and future

The Miller Gallery’s new exhibit positions itself as a discussion rather than a retrospective. Theo Schwarz | Staff Photographer

Dylan Abbott
Staff Wrz'ter

In 1993, the feminist punk band Bikini Kill
released its debut full—length album, Pussy
Whipped. “Alien She” was the title of the

second track on the album. It begins with

the usual conﬁdent clamor of a punk song,
then above the distorted guitar and cymbals,
lead vocalist Kathleen Harma armounces
the opening lines, “She is me/I am her/She
is me/I. am her.” The lyrics propose both a
uniﬁcation of disenfranchised women and
also a departure from the “feminine norms”
of 1990s culture. _

Twenty years alter the release of Pussy
Whipped, Carnegie Mellon’s Miller Gallery
opened its new exhibition, Alien She, on
Sept. 21. The exhibition presents memora-
bilia from the genesis of the riot grrrl era
to the modern incarnations of movement
chapters across the globe while also show-
casing contemporary artists who have been

heavily inﬂuenced by the iconic movement.

The riot grrrl movement was_pioneered
by bands such as Bikini Kill and Bratmobile.
By incorporating the do-it-yourself punk
aesthetic into music, protests, group meet-
ings and handmade zines, young women of
the ’9os could communicate and collaborate
through a new chatmel of expression outside
of mainstream media.

Astria Suparak, co-curator of the exhibi-
tioh, explained why now is a good time to
reflect on what the movement was and the
impact it has had on modern culture: “At this
point, we’ve been able to see the inﬂuence of
riot grrrl in our peers, in contemporary art-
ists and in our own careers.” Suparak stated
that with the recent prevalence -of riot grrrl-

in the world —— notablythe controversy sur- ‘

rounding Pussy Riot, an all-female band in
Russia —— there is no better time than now
to look back on this epoch—deﬁning feminist
culture. A

Ceci Moss, also co-curator of the exhibi-

tion, succinctly stated, “riot grrrl was, and
still is, an expression of feminist politics 
and feminism is always relevant.”

The exhibition begins on the ground
ﬂoor of the gallery with a medley of archi-
val materials dating back to the early ’9os.

Hundreds of posters and ﬂyers advertising‘

feministﬁlm showings and local gig concerts
vie for attention on the far wall. An adjacent
wall is lined with shelves of handmade zines
and pamphlets dealing with issues promi-
nent vvithin and imperative to the riot grrrl
movement, including sexism, racism and
homophobia.

On the opposite side of the room, a large
barmer hangs alone, emblazoned with the
words: “What is riot grrrl?” and the move-
ment’s manifesto and motivations printed in
bold letters, endingwith the line, “we are cre-
ating the revolution. We ARE the revolution.”

center of the room. Visitors are invited to

from America, Brazil, England, Belgium and

and clips from punk shows provides both
a commentary and soundtrack to the litany
of materials on display. Repeated visits are
necessary to digest all of these intriguing
artifacts.

V Carland, who collaborated on the record
art for Bikini Kill albums as a part of the riot
grrrl genesis in the early ’90s, is one of the
seven artists involved with the Alien She ex-
hibition to have had ﬁrst-hand experience
with the movement. She explained how she

came embedded in cultural movements, both
pop culture and underground movements. 

_become an embedded movement.”

What is presented in Carland’s work is
arguably a more considered and assured pre-
sentation of particular topics of sexuality and
feminism when compared to the visceral,
chaotic aesthetic of riot grrrl in the ’9.0s. She
continues to suggest that “the language and
vernacular of [riot grrrl] appeals to younger
people.”

“That’s why it’s so important that [the
exhibition] is taking place in a university,”
she said

L.]. Roberts is representative of the new
generation of artists to spring from the riot
grrrl movement. “I was on the younger side
of things with riot grrrl, but my strongest
inﬂuence has been Tammy Rae Carland. She

perceives the legacy of this era: “I think that '

What started off as a separatist movement has -

was one of my teachers,” Roberts said. Situ-
ated on the third ﬂoor of the Miller Gallery,
Roberts’ work incorporates materials often
equated with craftsmanship or “amateur”
arts, such as knitting and banner production.

Roberts’ “We Couldn’t Get In. We Couldn’t
Get Out” is a 10-foot-by-30-foot steel fence
completely encased in Woven pink wool. It
dominates the third ﬂoor of the exhibition.

Roberts explained during the openingtour of i

the exhibition that she used a children’s pink
Barbie knitting machine to produce the piece.
The boldness, intricacy and humour of her
work communicates afresh style of feminist
and queer representation, informed by its
punk—predecessor and also by the resurgence
of craft—based production in recent years.
The third floor also hosts work by Stepha-
nie Syjuco, whose piece “Free Text” invites
gallery visitors to take a variety of tear—off
tabs with URLs that supply links to free digi-
tal texts related to all manner of thematically
relevant issues on gender, hacking, postrnod—
ernism and queer theory. Syjuco presents
another example of an artist embracing the
riot grrrl ethos and applying it to contem-
porary issues of digital copyrights and how,
as the Internet generation, we interact with
the endless amounts of information avail-
able to us. -

Ginger Brooks Takahashi, a North Brad- .

dock resident, provides a retrospective of her
collaborative artistic, musical and communal
endeavours, all of which are presented under
the striking title “A Wave of New Rage Think-
ing.” Takahashi plays an integral partwithin
the exhibition. She both personiﬁes the thriv-
ing, communal art scene in Pittsburgh and
is also representative of the multi-faceted
nature of riot grrrl, refusing to conﬁne herself
to one medium and one avenue of expression.

Sara Marcus, author of “Girls to the Front:

' The True Story of the Riot Grrrl Revolution,”

the ﬁrst publicationto document the his-
tory of riot grrrl, expressed her opinion as
to why the movement has this resurgence
and generates so much interest. She said,
“It’s not just something that was ‘curious’
and ‘quaint,’ but because the question of how
young women’s minds and lives are consoli-
dated and communicated in our culture today
is still relevant.”

In the epilogue ofher deﬁnitive history of
riot grrrl, Marcus outlines some truths that
further support a need for a cultural shift:

his role as Piper’s emotional anchor to life»
outside of prison.

In addition to providing showrunners with
the opportunity to tell daring stories, part
of the Netflix appeal is in giving viewers the
freedomto consume content at anypace they
desire. Although some creative minds, such
as “Arrested Development” creator Mitch
Hurwitz, have condemned all-too-common
“binge viewing” marathon sessions on
program-streaming services, this practice
has undeniably changed the way most of us
watch TV.

Debates can be waged about whether the
binge culture marks the cataclysmic end to
serialized television as we know it, remov-
ing viewers from the organic break between
episodes. But if Netflix continues to produce
series as strong and addictive as “Orange,” it
shouldn’t matter if audiences rip through a
season in anaftemoon or a month.

As with any influential, ideologically
driven subculture, there is often the threat
that the movement will eventually become
oversaturated andjust another marketable,
empty symbol.

Yet Alien She captures the irrepressible
legacy of riot grrrl’ and avoids reverting to a
nostalgic reﬂection on better days. Instead, it
uses the movement as a platformfrom which
a new generation can explore the feminist
and queer issues that were once erupting
from punk gigs, scribbled upon leaﬂets and
discussed at weekly meetings.

Marcus stated that “there are incredible
opportunities today for people to make their
own media and create communities.” Alien
She certainly demonstrates such opportuni-
ties being taken by the artists involved with
the exhibition and heralds them as models
for the rest of our generation. [

Pitt alumni
struggle in
week 7

Sean Corrado
p Staff Wrz't_er

Week seven brought one of the worst weeks
in recent history for the former Panthers
in the NFL, except for one usually quiet
alumnus who proved to be valuable for
his team.

Indianapolis Colts offensive lineman
Mike McGlynn (Pitt 2004-2007‘) has been
starting at right guard for the last two sea-
sons. McGlynn, who was originally drafted

A ‘in 2008 by the Philadelphia Eagles, has

proven to be a reliable force in pass block-
ing and has yet to miss a start for the Colts.

During Sunday night’s matchup with
the Denver Broncos, Colts starting center
Samson Satele left the game with an ap-
parent knee injury. McGlynn was chosen
to move over to center —— a position he has
not played in nearly three years — and take
control of the offensive line.
I McGlynn stepped up enormously. He
successfully picked out blitzes and helped
quarterback Andrew Luck command the
offense. When Denver was climbing back
into the game and threatening to take the
lead, McGlynn never lost his composure.
His exchange with Luck was smooth all
night and did not appear to have one poor
snap all game. I

McG1ynn’s _strong performance at cen-
ter was a key factor in an emotional 39-33
victory over Peyton Manning and the rest
of the Broncos. His durability, versatility,
and patience are qualities that the Colts
surely admire. If McGlynn, who is in the
second year of a two-year contract, keeps
possession of this admiration, he may be
looking at a nice payday in the offseason.

Unlike McGlynn, other Panthers could
not ﬁnd notable success in the seventh

BASEBALL

Staff Wrz'ter

In the ﬁnal game of its intrasquad Navy-
Vegas World Series, the Pitt baseball
team split up into two teams and posted
offensive—heavy performances in an 11-6
win for the Vegas team. The Vegas side
also won Friday’s game, _5—3, to sweep
the series. 3

Saturday’s ballgame wasn’t every-
thing the scoreboard might suggest. It
lasted 10 innings and saw a grand total

of seven errors, including several passed"

balls and several pickoff attempts in

which the ball ended up in right field.

Some of Pitt’s coaching consisten-
cies were made clear during the game,
which, on the positive side for the Pan-
thers, featured three home runs, a sui-
cide squeeze, hit—and-run attempts and
more bunting.

Assistant coach Bryan Peters said
that Saturday, Pitt batters read the
defense well before stepping up to
the plate, something they’ve always
preached. ,

“We want to have a versatile offense,”
said Peters. “Part of what makes a ver-
satile offense is to exploit the defense’s
weaknesses. If they’re giving us the
bunt, we’ll take it. If they’re allowing
us to steal, we’ll steal.”

Pitt batters took advantage of pitches
left hanging over the plate on Saturday.
Combined, the teams sent three balls
sailing over the blue padded walls of
Charles L. Cost Field that now sport the

ACC emblem in two places.

_ Junior outfielder Boo Vazquez was
responsible for two of the home runs.
Not known as a traditional home—run
hitter, Vazquez thinks the reputation
could see a change in the spring.

“I’m cutting loose a little bit more,”
said Vazquez. “I just think I’ve learned
a little bit more about how my swing
works, and I’ve grown into my body a
little bit.”

The two-year starter is just coming

off a year of summer ball in the Cape Cod
League, where he was recognized as an

All—Star. In the Cape Cod League, play- '

ers use wooden bats,‘as opposed to the
aluminum bats used in NCAA Baseball.

Still, Vazquez is by no means fazed by
the midsummer switchfrom aluminum
to wood and the switch back to alumi-
num, as well. ,

“I think it’s more natural to swing
with wood. I don’t think it messes any-
thing up,” Vazquez said. V

Vazquez also contributed in the field
with the defensive play of the day in
the top of the seventh: Sprinting after
a line drive off the bat of Nick Yarnall,

the 6—foot—4 right fielder made an im-
pressive over—the—shoulder grab on the
warning track with his shoulders paral-
lel to the wall. .

The game’s other home run was hit

offthe bat ofCasey Roche. It was a two-
run shot that snuck itself inside the left
foul pole to put the Vegas team up 6-2,
which scored Frank Maldonado after he
reached on a bunt single.
“If they’re falling behind in the count,
we’ll drive balls andhit home runs. We
have to hit the long ball on occasion,
which we’ve shown,” Peters said.

World Series  10

 FROM PAGE 9

WORLD SERIES

Vazquez’ first home run came against
the team’s conﬁrmed ace, Matt Woth-
erspoon. The coaching staff stretched
Wotherspoon out for four ‘full innings,

and the senior allowed four earned ‘runs '

to plate on six hits.

Wotherspoon reflected on plenty of
mistakes in his no-decision. '

“My fastball location wasn’t great to-
day,” said Wotherspoon, “I need to get
ahead in the count a little more. I_was
behind too many hitters.”

Peters explained the reasons for ex-
tending Wotherspoon’s inning count.
One reason in particular points to his
role as a leader: He leads by example.

“I think Wotherspoon is our clear
number one. He’s the Friday-night guy,”
Peters said. “We wanted him to estab-
lish himself in that role, work himself
out of some jams if necessary, which is
something he’ll have to do as the Friday-
night guy.”

While Wotherspoon’s performance on
the mound wasn’t up to the-standard he
set last season, in which Wotherspoon

-went 9-3 with a 3.70 ERA and struck out

85 batters during 107 innings, the coach-
ing staff allowed him to pitch through
the four-run outing to exhibit what an
ace looks like.

“He’s the ace of the staff. He has the

most experience as a starter,” Peters
said. “We have a lot of newcomers and
we wanted them to watch what a real
ace does, what a Friday-night guy is go-
ing to do. So we extended him and we
wanted him to throw the most innings
this weekend.” I
