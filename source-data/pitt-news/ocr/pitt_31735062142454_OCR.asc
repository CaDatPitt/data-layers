1 1:30; Soldiers & Sailors Memorial

All Fourth Hour Classes
Dismissed By Chancellor

“One Year Toward Victory” will be marked by the Uni-
versity this morning as students, faculty, and administra-
tion members gather in Soldier’s and Sailor’s Memorial hall
at 11:30 to commemorate America’s entrance into World

War II.

Fouth hour classes have been dismissed by official an-

nouncement.

Highlight of this morning’s assembly will be Vice-
Chancellor Rufus H. Fitzger- -

ald, who will tell of the place
of higher education in its re-
lationship to today’s war. He
will discuss the negotations
and conferences that have
been going on during the past
months to determine the sta-
tus of American colleges for the
duration. '

Mr. Fitzgerald, just returned
from a conference in New York, on
this same subject, will tell today’s
assembly just what he told the Uni-
versity board of trustees a week
ago, and repeated to the Univers-
ity senate last Friday afternoon.

“The students must be given
all the available facts as to the
future of the war-time American
collegian. I shall give them ev-
ery available hit of information,”
Mr. Fitzgerald told the Pitt
News last Saturday.

Symbolizing the University’s
contribution to the war effort
through its purchase of stamps and
war bonds, the stamp drive com-
mittee will present a jeep to the
US armed forces at this morning's
assembly. A jeep a week, is now
the goal of the University bond
and stamp drive.

Robert Sullivan, Ed43, will be
the main student speaker in this
morning's program. Sullivan will
describe some of the changes
wrought in student life by the im-
pact of the war, and will tell of the
tranisition that, in one year, has
changed the University from a
peace-time institution to one well

ﬁtted into the total war program»

of the nation.

Reverend Hugh Thompson Kerr,
of the Shadyside Presbyterian
church, will offer a special prayer
before the assembly, which will be
followed by the adopting of the
Pitt pledge for victory by the en-
tire student body.

Chairman of this morning’s
assembly is Edward Tablac,
BA43, who will deliver the key-
note address of the meeting.
Serving on the Commemoration
Day committee with Tablac have
been'Esther Berland, C44, and
Irving Leiber, C44. Pitt Riﬂes
will act as ushers.

Today’s observance at the Uni-
versity is part of a nation-wide
commemoration program, that was
suggested for all colleges and uni-
versities by the American Council
on Education.

Outside of the Chancellor’s as-
sembly, held two years ago, today’s
meeting marks the ﬁrst time that
questions of administration policy,
such as are generally included in
trustee reports and senate meetings
have been given ﬁrst-hand to Pitt
students.

Today’s program the fourth hour in Soldier’s and Sailor’s
Memorial Hall is dedicated to the changes that have come to
the University as it has mobilized for war. We are to hear all
about what has already been done———acceleration, activities
cu1r1tl;ailment, war courses, war research projects, compulsory
at etics.

We are going to get a panoramic shot of “One Year To-
ward Victory.”

But of even more importance will be the picture that
we’re going to be shown of what the “Second Year Toward
Victory” is going to be like in American schools and colleges.

For, on the basis of What has already appeared in the
pages of the Pitt News, and on the basis of what you’ll hear
this morning, changes undreamed of, sweeping reforms, are
in store for the colleges of America.

The exact plans, down to each last detail still have to be
worked out. But the direction they are taking is apparent.
Government subsidization of college training, civil service se-
lection of college students, education with a social purpose——
these things are closer at hand than any of us can possibly
imagine.

Everyone is urged to attend today’s assembly. Classes
have been dismissed. Because what you will hear at today’s
meeting about what the colleges will be like in a few months
is the beginning, the ground-breaking, of what may be the
greatest revolution in American education yet written into
the history books.

We congratulate the administration of the University for
conducting such an assembly. We share with them the feel-
ing that the students cannot be over-informed about what’s
going to happen to them, to their schools. We hope that to-
day’s meeting serves as the basis for other meetings——other
frank discussions of problems and policy between adminis-
tration and students.

Then there’s something else that we like about today’s
meeting. Perhaps it, too, points the way to change and pro-
gress. That is the re-discussing of a report to the trustees
with the faculty and students of the University.

. For Vice-Chancellor Fitzgerald’s speech was ﬁrst a trus-
tee report. Then an address to the University Senate. And
now, every student is getting the opportunity to hear ﬁrst
hand what was told to these two administrative groups.

This is the ﬁrst time that anything like this has hap-

-pened at the University.

And we, along with SFA, along with the administration
and faculty of the University, advise every student to go to
today’s meeting, to learn about the future that we’ll all soon
be ﬁghting for.

ptlﬂ giuc/end’  . . .

I hereby pledge allegiance to the ideals of freedom,
equality, justice, and humanity, for which the loyal sons and
daughters of Pitt are offering their lives, in this hour of
world crisis. I will earnestly and faithfully study and work
to prepare myself to assume my fair share of our country's
burden, and to make my contribution to the creation of a

better society in a post war world, that those ideals may
have full realization.

Uncertain

Says ACE

Nothing has as yet been decided
on the exact future of the colleges.

Students are advised to delay
any action until official government
action has been taken.

This was the latest word to come
‘from Washington, Where, accord-
ing to sources high w""'
American Council on Education,
the ﬁnal report on the negotiations
between the Day Committee (rep-
resenting the schools) a"

Army and Navy manpower board
was still on the president’s desk.

And since everything relevant
to the future of American higher
education and its relationship to
the war depends on this report-—
students are advised not to assign
too much validity._to the Welter
of semi-official and unofficial ru-
mors that have emanated from
Washington.

At this morning’s Commemora-
tion Day assembly, the latest up—to-
date and reliable material at hand
will be available to students.

Meanwhile the American Council
on Education, in its latest bulletin
to the colleges, advised students to
“sit tight,” to wait until the gov-
ernment had reached some deﬁnite
decision on the knotty problem of
education and the war.

The Army Specialist Training
Program was also made known by
the A. C. E. bulletin. The program
calls for:

1. Induction into the armed
forces of enlisted reserves, ad-
vanced ROTC members.

2. The selection of a limited
number of these men for limited
training.

3. And their reassignment to
selected colleges and universities
for such time as shall be desig-
nated by the army.

But students must remember that
this is NOT the ﬁnal word. It is
what the army has been negotiat-
ing for these past weeks with rep-
resentatives of the colleges. And
this plan, the idea of the armed
forces will, no doubt, be changed
considerably as a result of the com-
promise between the school’s and
the army’s programs. The result of
this compromise, the ﬁnal plan still
awaits the presidential OK.

The bulletin, dated November
27, anticipates action on the com-
promise plan within two weeks.
That means that the all-import-
ant word on the future of the
schools will come from Washington
any day now.
