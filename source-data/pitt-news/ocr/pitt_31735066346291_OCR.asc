Plans for the trip call for the
buses to depart from the Univer-
sity, at midnight, November 3, stop
on the road for breakfast, and
arrive in Syracuse before game
time. The buses will leave Syra-
cuse shortly after the game, stop
for dinner, and return to Pitts-
burgh early the following morn-
ing. according to Bob Rowley,
publicity chairman.

Tickets‘for the trip will be on
sale tomorrow through next Wed-
nesday at the student desk in the
Cathedral and at the entrance to
the cafeteria where cheerleaders
will be stationed during meal
time. Students may either make
an initial $5.00 deposit or they
may pay the full amount, $17.60.
Those. who pay only the deposit
must pay the balance by October

Student Government reminds
women resident students that they
must secure permission to leave

the dormitories for the weekend.

To do this they may consult their

 Health Service

Makes Flu
Shots Available

Only Certain Students
Eligible For Vaccine

_ Immunizations

Dr. Douglass S. Thompson, ‘Di-
rector of Student Health Service,
announced that the Service will
immunize certain fu1l-time“stu-
dents against influenza.

“At this time we believe there
is no evidence of an epidemic or

A ‘epidemic “build up” anywhere in

the world,” Dr. Thompson said.

The Student Health Service will
immunize against influenza only
those registered full time students
who have any chronic and ser-
ious heart or lung disease, dia-
betes or other metabolic disorder;
are pregnant; or are over 65 years
of age ——-so long as its supply
of vaccine is available.

Dr. Thompson cautioned that
persons who are allergic to eggs
orchicken, or have had allergic
reactions in the past after influ-
enza immunization, should not re-
ceive this vaccine. '

“Sensitivity to penicillin is not
a factor in this regard,” he added.

The steps for a registered full
time student who qualiﬁes and
who desires to_ be immunized
against inﬂuenza are first to
obtain a written permission from
parent or guardian and bring this
along with 50 cents in exact
change to the Student Health
Service, Brackenridge Hall, Mon-
day through Friday, between 2
and 4 p.m. before October 14.

The written permission should
contain the student’s name and
the signer’s name as well as the
date of signing and the full pur-
pose of the permission.

The Service warns that a re-

action_ of sore arm and a feeling
of grippe may follow the shot.
_A second shot will be given
Monday through Friday between
November 6 and 17 at the same
times. .

Dr. Thompson said the Service
is watching carefully for evidence
of an epidemic and may adopt a
different policy in the future.

Nobody thinks about Columbus these days. Let us, there-
fore, pause for a moment and retell his ever—glorious, endlessly

Columbus-ﬂevaawfsi-Zailmytheir;-o

Clsristoplier Columbus was born in Genoa on Aiigust 25, 1451.
His father, Ralph T. Columbus, was in the three-minute auto
Wash game. His mother, Elezmor (Swifty) Columbus, was a.
sprinter. Christopher was an only child, except for his four
brothers and eight sisters. With his father busy all day at the
auto wash and his mother constantly away at track meets,
young (‘oluinbus was left pretty niuch“to his own devices.
However, the lad did not _sulk or brood. He was an avid reader
and spent all his waking hours immersed in a book. Unfortu-
nately, there was only one book in Genoa at the time-—('a.re of
the Horse by Aristotle——and after several years of rdading (‘are
of the Horse, Columbus grew restless. So when rumor reached
him that therewas another book in Barcelona, oft he ran as

. fast as his fat littlellegs would carry him.

The rumor, alas, proved false. The only book in Barcelona
was (,.'m.'dar 11.71. Caballo by Aristotle, which proved to be nothing
more than a Spanish translation ot"(.'m*e of the Horse.

Bitterly disappointed, Columbus began to dream of going
to India where, according to legend, there were thousands of
books. But the only way to go to India was on horseback, and
after so many years of reading Care of the Horse, Columbus
never wanted to clap eyes on a horse again. Then a new thought.
struck him: perhaps it was possible to get to India by sea’.

Fired with his revolutionary new idea, Columbus raced to
the court of Ferdinand and Isabella on his little fat legs (Colum- ‘
bus, though six feet tall, was plagued with little fat legs all his
life) and pleaded his case with such fervor that the rulers were

On October 12, 1492, Columbus- set foot on the New World.
The following year he returned to Spain with a cargo of wonders
never before seen in Europe—spices and metals and plants and

, ﬂowers and-most wondrous of all-—tobacco! Oh, what a sense.-
tion tobacco caused in Europe! The ﬁlter had long since been
invented (by Aristotle, curiously enough) but nobody knew
what to do with it. Now Columbus, the Great Discoverer,
made still another great discovery: he took a ﬁlter, put tobacco
in front of it, and invented the world’s ﬁrst ﬁlter cigarette!

Through the centuries ﬁlters have been steadily improved
and so has tobacco, until today we have achieved the ultimate
in the ﬁlter cigarctte—Mar1boro, of course! Oh, what a piece
of work is Marlboro! Great tobacco, great ﬁlter, great smoke!

in ‘relatively worsening physical

posture in the world compared to the communist“

Vbloc. Some would say that we ‘are apatlietic, but

there mustbe more than’ plain indifference affect-
ing us. . . ‘ ‘

Perhaps this is more a case of being indifferent,
because the truth hurts too much. Is this “surface
apathy” really a case of a nation of 180,000,000
people so satisﬁied with their position in the world,
or is it a’ case of 180,000,000 people so afraid of a
danger that they refuse to admit that it exists?
Know the Danger .

There had to be a natural letdown after World
War II. We were ‘tired after ..four years of a hard
war’ and even our national leaders were susceptible
to‘this letdown. But, after all, we have had six-
teen years to become acquainted with the danger.

Our ﬁrst inklings of what was to be in store
for us came in 1949-50, with .,the Russian explo-
sion of an atomic bomb and the start of the Korean
war. - l ‘

But instead of reacting to this danger with a
logical attack on it, we went searching for some-
one to tell us that everything would turn out ﬁne
in the end. The Republican Party sensing this, re-
jected a man of such blunt honesty _in Robert Taft
and presented “Ike -5 the Father Image” to us. We
got what we wanted.

Another outstanding example of - our fear to
recognize the true nature of our problem was ex-
emplified by the gang that denied there was an ex-
ternal communist menace, and instead demanded

The State Of The “Union"...

Achilles’ Heel

?i%By Ralph “W. Peterson

Coin‘cident_ with the expansion of the Univer-

sity is the resurgence of the city‘of Pittsburgh.

01199 kn0Wn 01113’ as the metropolis of steel and
soot, through ifiits urban redevelopment, its smoke
control,’ its mehtal rejuvenation, Pittsburgh has
emerged from its medieval co- “ A

coon. For The “Renaissance City '
of America” banner, ' weyare in-
debted only in part to the pub-
licity men; unlike most adver-
tising slogans, this one is mostly
true.  .

Last month", Pittsburgh ad-
vanced’ again with its architec-
turally novel Civic Auditorium.
Plans also were announced for
another imposing structure, a
motor hotel innovation. in the .
city center. And the purchase of land began for
the giant Northside redeyelopment program.

It would seem from‘ here however, that\Pitts-
bu.rgh’s progress is hindered by thernoctopus-like.
force called “unionism.” An alarming factor in
commerce and politics on ‘the national scene, its
death-dealing embrace in thislocale is frightening.
Careful Reiteraiion _ .

As is customary in such philippics, one should
carefully iterate that unions have their place in
the American scheme. All ssegnients of society
probably have benéﬁtted from labor gains in this
century. But the enormous power exerted by
unionism, affecting the well-being of everyone,
seems wielded too often in irresponsibility and
capriciousness. g .

The afore-mentioned Civic Auditorium, the
pride of Pittsburgh and a case in point, was de-
layed last year by a steel strike which necessitated
a three—months’ postponement of its dedication,
Naiitionally. known ﬁgures scheduled for appearance
on the original dedication date were unable‘ to ‘be I
present at the later time. Franticrnanipulations

Afraid of‘Fear

 

3 _this really only an extension of a national fear, to

 

    
    

 
 

  

that we clear our government service of “pinks
reds, and fellow travelers.” .

. While they harassed our diplomats, military
men, and professors under the leadership of Me?
Carthy, the communists laid careful plans for ac.
tions in Southeast Asia and the Middle East. Later
actions showed that these plans were indeed well‘
laid. ~ _, f  ’
An Ulﬁmafe Fear , ‘~

Perhaps the ultimate step in our. fear to tea“
and act against the danger came when McCarth"
cast doubt «on General George Marsha1l’s 19yalty,_
There was no great outcry against this. The Fathe 
Image did not publicly castigate the very ,JnniQ
Senator from Wisconsin. But we’ re—electeil'5”—him
in 1956. - « ‘ . 

How many times did Ike and Dick tell us wlia
we wanted to hear so desperately, that everythin
was all right and there was nothing*to ewor
about? Yet Nixon had the gall to run -‘on Eise
hower’s record and almost won: ' ' CW 4 n, ,1.

\ How many people doubted that Gagat‘-in ream
orbited the earth? How many people are afraid to
buy fall-out shelters? It is to" the Presidents credit ’
that he is doing everything possibleito «alert ‘the;
nationthat there really is a danger. ~ I

the college campuses? . _

Here at Pitt we’ll knock all those charges of
apathy. We’ll have more pep ralies‘ and run
through the halls shouting “No more classes-.”
We’ll call ROTC cadets “boy scouts,” because its
really funny and Khrushchev’s only blufﬁng  4«
anyway. .

And we won’t have time ‘to’ join the Young
Democrats or Young Republicans orlnternational
Relations Club or the Society for Conservative
Studies or even Student Sane, because we’re not
indifferent. If we were apathetic we wouldn’t find
the time to decorate a fraternity house for Home-

Ngl-ionally Notorious _

The General Motors’ plant at West Mifﬂin is
the latest Pittsburgh area enterprise to’ gain na-
tional notgriety. In the protracted UAW negotia-
tions’ with General Motors, it has the doubtful dis-
tinction of being among the ﬁrst auto workers‘ local
to strike and the last to‘go back to work. ‘

. While union problems are a national malady (as
witness -the recent labor scandals at Cape Can-
3V€Fa1), it seems that the Pittsburgh area has a dis-
pmlgortionate share. t is no secret that industries
have left the district for regions less strife-ridden.

7 Astronomy

Makes History

With First Air Flight In 1896.

By MATT SWETONIC

It is common knowledge to

themajority of students that

the new addition to the natural sciences building is called
Langley Hall, but not one out of a thousand knows who this
mysterious man Langley was or what he did to warrant such

a honor.

Samuel Pierpont Langley came to the University in 1867

as pI'0f€SSOI'!Of astronomy and di-6
rector of the Allegheny Observa-
tory. When he left 20 years later
to become secretary of the Smith-
sonian Institute in Washington, he
left behind him a list of accom-

credit to both his name and the
University I .
-He invented the balometer, a

ing heat up to one-one hundred-
thousandth of a degree.
Studied Radiation

In 1885 he became the first
American ever to address the
Royal Institute of Great Britain,
and a few years earlier he led an

atop Mt.\Whitney in California.

He initiated the “Allegheny
System” for sending the correct
solar time direct by telegraph
to railroads, steel mills, banks,
and other concerns where the
exact time is of great impor-

" «He was the discoverer of the
bent-wing principle of aerody-
namics, the basis of air ﬂight to-
day, and he was the first to suc-
cessfully ﬂy a heavier‘ than air
machine.
, Launched Plane
In November of 1896 he launch-

4200 feet at a top speed of 30
mph.

Unsuccessful in a further pil-
oted attempt, Langely was forced
to give up his aeronautical ex-
periments, but he lived to see
the, Wright Brothers employ
the devices which he had de-
veloped when they made their
famous ﬂight in 1903.

A hermit for reasons of econo-
my, Langley ate, slept, and work-

Allegheny Observatory.

He enjoyed chats with his stu-,
dents and often read fables to
children out of a book which he
always carried with him.

Langley died in 1906, leaving
behind .a scientiﬁc heritage which
the University is seeking to fur-
ther in the building which bears
his name.

SOME SOUTHERN GENTLEMENA

The Baylor Bears are a Southern football team with no
mildew on their magnolia leaves, and were no gracious
belles as far as the rugged Pitt football players are con-
cerned. The fans at the~Stadium saw a poised, hard-hitting
Texas outﬁt that was gifted with speed.

What they didn’t see, however. were the Bears up close.
The winning team presented atcontrasting study to the Pitt
squad in the dressing rooms after the game- L/o.sers'don’t want

A Cat—calls resounded from the close walls,
and a red-headed John Dixon Bridgers, the
coach of the South west representative, was
all teeth. A native of Birmingham, Alabama,
who coached at Sewanee, John, Hopkins
University and the Baltimore Colts in the
past, Bridgers was a happy man as he am-
bled through a swamp of "sweaty togs and

“Pitt’s got a lotta ﬁght and _a

glanced at Herby Adkins, a tightly wound
ﬁreball, who doesn’t weigh 185 but insists
that he’s 190 plus.

Adkins was the man who blocked Fred "
Cox’s extra—point kick. This later cost the
Panthers a chagce for a win, when they were
within /ﬁeld goal range in the closing sec- --
onds, but trailing by three points rather
than two.

“You jus’ keep an eye on that l’l fella,”

remarked Bridgers. “He’s a corner! Gonna be a good one, too.”
We turned to talk to Ronnie Goodwin, who hails from

Odessa, Texas, batted .419 for the Baylor baseball team last

year, was offered a $40,000 bonus to turn pro, and ran ragged

through the Pitt line. _

\ Goodwin is slim, with sharp malignant eyes and a sharp

towel draped about his neck, which looked
like a hen’s leg. His blue eyes were charcoal-
rimmed and watery. There was no color in
his shallow face.

“I reckon that I thought that I was
liable to bust a gut today,” Goodwin sigh-
ed, rubbing his rib-cage. “A body can’t be
. too careful with this team. Tha’s a good team,
but I don’t think thar’s a whole lotta diﬁer—

Bull / I “I want ya to understan’, I kinda think

Ronnie Bull was drying himself off when I approached
him. “Jus’ like we expected,” said Bull, who like his fast
mates, is slow on the drawl, “rough and tough. We was down
a l’il bit, but we knew we’d have to ﬁght back.”

Ronnie Stanley, the exciting Bear quarterback was next

BY Ed HOWARD

“A great improvement in team p1ay——-I’m very satisﬁed.”
Leo Bemis ‘was fairly glowing with satisfaction after his
soccer team dominated play while chewing up Ohio Univer-
sity, 4-0, at Athens, Ohio, Saturday morning. I

The Panthers amassed a total of 57 shots against the
Ohioans, holding them to a meager sixteen. There is any old

L

 

maxim in soccer circles that a

“ team that takes thirty shots a

game won’t lose very often, so
the Cats had a good, offensive
day, indeed. A

Sam Donatelli, hustling all
the way at inside-right, tallied
first for the Pitt booters, a shot
from_ a scuffle in front of the
Ohio goal. _Corky Cuthbert and
red-h ded Nick Bares scored in
the second period, and Cuthbert
ﬁnished the t-day’s scoring in the
third guarter with another inside

a

shot. 
New Faces Help
There were some changes in the
offensive line, all of which made
Coach Bemis look like a maste
strategist. ‘ V
Bemis switched Cuthbert to
replacing the
ailing Alberto‘ Sichel. Untried
Jerry Yospin took Cuthbert’s
place at right wing. And Nick
Bares moved into the starting.
lineup at inside left. ‘
But the improvement wasn't
limited to the front line. Ray Tar-
asi and Paul Liberati looked good
at halfback. Both got a lot of
shots, with several near-misses;
They also kept the ball pretty
well concentrated in Panther ter-
ritory.
Okoth Steals Show
On defense, Captain Steve Dan-
iels and Chuck Dunbar each play-
ed ﬁne, steady games, and Han-
ningston Okoth roused himself for
the occasion, looking for all the
world like a potential All—Amer-
ican. The tall African took the ball

Sophomore Swimmer Bill

‘Shanahan recently became a

member of the exclusive Sig-

Athletic Honorary Fraternity
gains its exclusiveness from

the tough requirements needed to
gain admittance.

Bill had to pass numerous phys-

variety of tests included rpnning
events, ﬁeld events, swimming
tests and throwing trials.

Shanahan is the ﬁrst man to
enter Sigma Delta Psi since gym-
nast Joe Zamecnik gained admis-
sion last April.

Pole’ vaulter Gary Meckley and
Swimmer Steve Ganong need to
pass only one more test to be-
come members. The tests do not
need to be taken in any special
order nor is there any time limit
in which to pass all the tests.

The tests are conducted by
Coach Leo Bemis. One of Bemis’

ed membership in the fraternity

TWO IMPORTS from foreign

Another surprise starter was-
goalie George Georgakokis, who

recorded the ﬁrst shutout of his
soccer career. George had been
sidelined from last week’s open-
er with an injured shoulder, but
came through in ﬁne fashion
‘despite having worked out only
lightly all week. —

u-

Bemis attributed the win to bet-

ter teamwork, and frankly had
expected Ohio U. to be tougher.
“We still have some conditioning
problems, and the rough part of
the schedule is looming,” says the
mild-mannered coach.

No injuries were incurred, and
those already on the injured list
seem to be about ready for ac-
tion, so the picture after the win,
which brings the Panthers up to a
1-1 "season mark, seems to be a
bright one. -

In Ohi_o4-Team Race

By GERRY MAZO ’

“They showed a lot of spirit, and I’m really pleased ..with
everyone,” said an elated Carl Rees-. The Pitt cross—country
coach was referring to ,Saturday’s exciting quadrangular

by Ohio University, 32-34. Pitt’s thin-clads did, however,
ﬁnish ahead of both Bowling Green (76) and host Kent

Bill Kaliden, have combined to

somewhat inexperienced staff, that ‘

have at least two varsity letters to”

State (87). e O

A1‘3h0Ugh éxpected ‘£0 P0SSib1y lform which everyone was certain

take a 1-2-3 sweep of the race,
Ohio University was hard pressed
an the way by the Panthe: har-
riers. In the early part of the en-
counter, Pitt controlled 5 of the
first 8 positions.

After lapsing for a while in the

~middle of they race, the Reesmen

once again came on, strong at the
finish, but it was not quitestrong
‘enough’. ?

Flemig of the victors took. in-
dividual honors over the flat Kent
State course in 21:23. Pitt’s Steve
Waslo placed second "in 21:44.
Heller of Ohio University was
third across the ﬁnish line.

Larry Robinson and Bill Moc-

.nik came in ﬁfth and sixth, re-

spectively, for the Reesmen. Rob-
inson ran his usually efficient
race, wh_ile Mocnik showed the

that he possessed.

In ninth place was Bob Tark-'

any, while John Hart performed
better than he had run to date,
as he closed out the Panther’:
scoring in thirteenth place. A

Rees felt that his charges had
run “a lot better this week.” He
believed that similar performance:

in last. week’s loss ‘to Slippery,

Rock might have changed the out-
come of that race. “They just

‘needed some confidence in them-

selves,” explained the Pitt mentor.

‘ This coming Saturday the Pan-
ther harriers travel to University
Park, Pa. where they will meet the
Nittany Lions of Penn State. The
Lions are always one of the cross-
country powers in the East and
should provide a tough test.

ARCH IE SAYS :   

  
 
  

My cousin Archie—he thought the electric razor his gal gave
him last Christmas was o.k. Then he tried Old Spice Pro-Eleclric, .
the before shave lotion. Now the guy won’t stop tolkihg, he
thinks electric shoving is so great. ‘

   
 
  

 

 
  
   
 
 

If Archie ever stops talking, I’!
Electric myself.

ARCHIE SAYS Pro‘-Electric improves electric shoving even more
than lather improves blade shoving. ARCHIE SAYS Pro-Electric
sets up your heard by drying perspiration and whisker oils so
you shave blade-close without irritation. ARCHIESAYS Pro-
Electric gives you the closest, cleanest, fastest shave.

Wiley Says, Guzik   Can
.._,Be Key To Good Season

By RANDY -JESICK

Who‘ is Bob Guzik? Ask this question of most Pitt foot-
ball fans and they will say, “John Guzik’s brother.”

This answer is true, of course, but more importantly it
shows that Bob, Guzik has played in the shadow of his All-
American brother now with the Houston Oilers.

In regard to this situation, the"

6’2”, 218 pound right tackle on
the Panther ﬁrst team, says, “I
try my best to live up to John’s
name, but I realize that I don’t
have his natural ability. That
means I have to try that much

(harder to at least come within

range of him.”
Beter Oﬁensively

Bob has come within range of
his brother, according to the
coaches. “Bob is a-ctually a better
offensive football player than his
brother John,” comments tackle
coach Jack Wiley. “He’s had
trouble following in his brother’s
footsteps because of injuries, but
this season he’s enjoying the best
fall he’s ever had. Bob is begin-
ning to look like the player we
thought he could be.”

Guzik is looking forward to
playing his best collegiate game
this season. ,“But first I’ll have
to work on widening the base
of my blocks,” Guzik says. In
other words, he loses_a lot of
power in his blocks by not
keeping his feet wider apart.

Wiley agrees, “Bob has worked
on his problem this year, and we
hope that he continues to im-
prove?’

Guzik knows that he must keep
working because the 1961 Panther
squad has more depth than last
year and there is more competi-
tion for each position, particular-
ly on the second team.

Depth Helps
. “Depth helps a lo ,” says Guzik.
“It makes you work harder and
keep hustling because if you slow

or down or get hurt, another man

 

‘will move in without hurting the
team.” .

Guzik believes that the abund—i

ance of talented sophomores on
the present squad will provide
the depth. “Boys like (Paul) Mar-
tha, (Rick) Leeson, (Chuck) Ah].-
born, and the sophomore ends will
help.”
And of course depth is vital-
ly important with a rough 011-
ponent to be met each week.
“I’d rather play a tougher
schedule,” Guzik says. “becaailse
I can be proud to say that I
played against the big football
powers and All-Americans.”
Guzik commented on the 1961
Pitt schedule: “It’s one of the
toughest, but it’s a typical One-
The only possible breather is
West Virginia, and you know what
usually happens when Pitt and
West Virginia meet. If We work
has a team and have the proper
morale, we should come out with.

Tuition Fee Credit

Granted Draftees
And Enlisted Men

The Board of Trustees of the
University has released informa-

tion -concerning tuition credit for‘

students who are called into mili-
tary service during a trimester.
According to the new policy,-if

a student enlists or is called into

military service during a -term,
his tuition and Tees will be pro-
rated according to the period of
that term’ in which-she has been
"in attendance..

Credit for the portion ‘of his tui-
tion and fees that remains-unused
shall be given him for his use on
return later to the University.

The policy states that all deans,
directors, department chairmen,
and faculty members to whom a
student who is withdrawing comes
for assistance are to make sure
student satisfactorily’
completes his formal withdrawal
procedure. 6

John Geise, Assistant Chancel-

lor for Student Affairs, said “The
establishment of credit under these
conditions is to provide an‘ addi-

-tional incentive for the student to

resume his studies on completion
of his military service.” ’
Dr. Geise emphasized that with-
drawing students who wish to re-
ceive payment of their fees must
complete withdrawal procedures.
To obtain information on with-
drawal procedures the student

should consult with the clan of)

his department.
