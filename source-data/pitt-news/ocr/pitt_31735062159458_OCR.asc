"Truman is acting in the foot-
steps of other presidents in not
wanting to interfere in China,”
Col. M. Thomas Tchou declared
in a Student Congress sponsored
address in Stephen Foster Mem-
orial, Wednesday. The Chinese
statesman spoke on the topic,
“America and the Struggle in the
‘Near East."

He pointed out that, “Never be-
fore has China become so inter-
ested in world affairs.” In trying
to understand other 80V9m.m€“5S»
Col. Tchou has found that the
Chinese have the same essential
qualities that all people do.

Col. Tchou continued with a
short history of the growth of de-
mocracy in China, outlining the
people's government begun by Dr.
Sun Yat Sen early in the century,
and the present two party situation
in his country today in relation to
the influence of foreign, powers.

in conclusion, Col. Tchou affirm-
ed his faith in his native land by
saying, "Regardless of the out-

Grand Jury
Dismisses

Jug Case

The grand jury has dismissed
the bill of indictment .against Eguene
Seiling for insuffipient evidence.
Seiling had been held under aggra-
vated assault and battery charges
for throwing a wine jug that KOed
Pitt sophomore Marjorie Homan dur-
ing the Pitt-Penn State game.

Out ofthe more than 40,000 people
who watched the game,no witnesses
who actually saw the jug being
thrown were found. Friends with
whom Miss Homan attended the
game singled Seiling out of the
crowd as the thrower of the jug.

Freed on Bond

Taken to the Oakland Police
Station, Seiling was charged as the
alleged thrower and released under

‘$2500 bond. He deniedthat he tossed ,

the half-gallon jug and since that
time has steadfastly kept to that
statement.

The jug shattered on Miss Homan’s
head, causing scalp injuries. She
was taken to nearby Presbyterian
Hospital after the accident and had
to remain there over the weekend
until it was certain that injuries
were confined to the surface scalp
wound. ,

At a hearing before Magistrate
William Redmond at the Oakland
Station it was decided to push the
case (n to the grand jury to decide
whether or not to prosecute on the
charges.

Pitt Junior

Before .the jug incident Seiling
attended Pitt as a junior in the

School of Physical Education.
Shortly afterwards he dropped out
of school.

Mrs. Paul J. Homan, mother of
the Tri-Delt sophomore, said be-
fore the case was referred to the
grand jury that the Homans intended
to press charges against Seiling
only to the extent of the medical
expenses involved. '

However, Irwin Tryon, attorney
for the..Hornarrs, revealed that the
University would probably reimburse
the family for its medical expenses
through insurance which is carried
to cover such incidents.

Owl Sales

Beach 2057

The sale of 2057 subscriptions
has been reported by the Owl busi-
ness manager, Bob Rossel.

Sales during the first three weeks
of the fall semester amounted to
1100 copies, ‘but the fourth week,
during the first week of the coal
strike, only 1} copies were sold.
For this reason, Paul Lohmeyer,
advisor to student publications,
feels highly pleased with the total
number to date. Last year there
were 2300 Owls ordered, and 2180
sold.

Of the 2057 total subscriptions
sold, there are still 350 copies for

Busy Council Handles Six Problems

Men’s Council held one of its
busiest meetings of the year last
Tuesday with no less than half a
dozen major questions sharing the
agenda. »

Two amendments to the consti-
tution and changes inthe by-laws,
all of which affected eligibility of
members, were advanced by Jim
Morton. One amendment rules
against the election of anyone who

cannot spend two comple te seme sters

on Council. The second eliminates
candidates who are running for
both Student Congress and Men's
Council from further consideration
as a bona fide candidate for Coun-
cil. Both amendments must await
the next meeting for final con-
firmation.

Frosh Program

Joe Wolfe, chairman of the ‘cus-

toms andtraditions committee, pre-

    
 
  

    

failed in two ways: there was no
way of recognizing the freshmen
after the dinkswent out of use,.and
the functioning of the upperclass
court was delayed until it was no
longer of real value.

To remedy the first defect, the
committee proposed that the dinks
be worn on the ground floor and in
the hallways in addition to on cam-
pus. This would not be an infrac-
tion of good etiquette, according
to Wolfe, since the dink should not
‘be, considered as a part of the wear-
ing apparel but merely as thelabel
of the freshman.

No Publicity Wanted _

In order toincrease the effective-
ness of Upperclass Court, the com-
mittee recommended that the Court
be in session from the beginning

to the end of orientation‘ and that a
policy of closed sessions be em-

elected to make a final decision
on the evaluation report at a future
meeting.

License Tag Trial

Attention was then turned to Vic
Valacoursa’s report on panther-
shaped metal tags to fit onto auto-
mobile license plates. A student
had suggested these as a substi-
tute for window decals which are
illegal. Council decided to purchase

. 50 tags for $27‘as a trial. The tags

will be sold in the Council book

Howard Greenberger, Men's Coun-
cil representative to Congress and
and the victim of the alleged error,
proposed the “locked door” motion.
It was seconded by Dave Fox. '
The validity of the move was
immediately challenged by Dick
Kovar. Adviser Ruth Lutz said it
was within the jurisdiction of Con-
gress to exclude non-members.
Jack Lindsey, chairman of the
suggestion box committee, and an
unidentified young woman, along
with the reporter, were barred from
the Congressional chamber during *5

Greenberger Defends Motion

Greenberger defended his motion
with this statement: “In as much
as the Pitt News did not use for-
bearance after being asked not to
mention the preliminary reports
of the Faculty Rating committee,u
I feel it is necessary to hold this
portion of the meeting closed.”

The accuracy of this statement
was questioned by Betty Bolger."
She asked Miss Nunes and’Green-
berger if secrecy for the Faculty
Rating plan had been requested at
the Nov. 28 meeting. V

“I don’t rememBer.I’m not sure,”j:
Miss Nunes replied. Greenberger
remained silent. -

Despite the opposition of several
other Congressmen, one calling
the proceedure "undemocratic,"
the motion was carried by a 9 to 5"
vote.

When Student Congress ousted the News’ Congressional re-

Actually, the feuding aspect of this latest faux pas in Con-
gress seems to have been instigated by a very small minority of
the membership--just two conrgressmen. _'Howard Greenberger and

very seriously the “black eye” consequences of this,action.
For by supporting this move, they were giving Greenberger
sand Ewart, who have broken away from the‘ other members of
their formerly-strong five-man coalition, reinforcements for their
ridiculous duel with the News, which, in no way, can be recon-
ciled as constructive for or advantageous to Congress. ' '

At the same time, the seven enabled a precedent to be set
i-which can do ndthing but harm to Congress as a whole. When they
start hearing business behind locked doors, they raise suspicions

In this particular instance, there seems no defense whatso-
vet for attempting to keep Miss Nunes’ report under the Con-
tress bar. There may well be times when matters dealt with by
Congress need, during early stages at least, hush-hush treat-
ment. The News doesn't i_ndiscriminately publish everything it
- ts its hands on. When legitimate reason is offered, stories are
/eld until such time as they may be better released. However,
 ongressional material seldom merits this treatment.

_ Congress has as much power as
it has support from the student
body.

The above-mentioned students
when asked if,they had voted in
last Springfs elections inevitably
sretorted with, "What for?” It is
lthese students who bellow about
Congress’, supposed ineffective-
ness,who are responsible for that
very same ineffectiveness.

No governing body can effective-
ly act unless its constituents,
while possibly not agreeing with
it, are at least interested in it.
Such is apparently not the case
with a great majority of the stu-
dent body at Pitt. .

Last Spring's elections brought
out only 25 per cent approximately
of. the eligible voters. More than
25 per cent are certainly inter-
estedin how many hours they have
off for rallies, the plans for the
proposed Student Union, prices in
the Tuck Shop, and in such small,
but still important matters, such as
cold water in the fountains and
more pencil sharpeners.

These points have crossed Con-

This Fall Student Congress pre-

Philadelphia for the Pitt-Penn
game, one of their most construc-

ride lost its tires, however, when
only about 100 students came

dents had enough school spirit.

probably prevent another attempt
in the near future from ever taking

Charles ’W. Blaker, who gave up
engineering for the ministry, has
recently beenappointed director of
the Westminster Foundation.

The Foundation, an agency in
the national Presbyterian church,
appointed Blaker who will work as
a spiritual counselor for students
at Pitt, Tech and p-C-W. ,

Blaker, a Pitt graduate, willlrelp
in student activities which have a
religious nature. His work will lead
mainly with Presbyterians.

One of the main things Blaker
hopes to achieve is to ‘develop
churchmanship for those students
away from home. _

Three organizations were added
to Pitt’s long list last~ week at a
meeting of the Committee on Re-
cognition of Student Organizations.
On probationary recognition is the
Student Christian Federatioh whose
president is Richard Campbell.

The Panther ‘Club was officially-
re-activated with Lou Cecconi as
prexy. The Pitt Student Federal-
ists will be granted full recognition
on Feb. 25, 1950 with John Spanos
as president.

Ninty-one of the preserit organi-
zations on campus have submitted
their student organization Annual
Reports to the committee.

The three organizations that did
not respond at all: the Pitt Inde-
pendent Association, Gamma Sigma
Phi, and the Pitt Flying Club, were
pronounced in danger of being dis-
solved within‘ the near future if no
reports were submitted.

Criticism was made in the meet-
ing of groups that did not submit
written reports or make a nerbal
contract with the committee. The
groups were Alpha Kappa Delta,
the Association of Mining Eng-
ineers, Alpha Omega Tau, Pi Sigma
Alpha, the Speech and Hearing
Society, and Sigma Beta Sigma.

Teachers Placement Bureau  

Helps Stadents Land Jobs

By MARJORIE RAGER ,

Beginning teachers looking for jobs have only to go to the.
Teachers Placement Buerau for help in getting placements.

The Teachers Placement Bureau, a division of the School of

Education, helps to place students in teaching jobs after gradu-

ation.

In 1933, when the firstannual report was made, 39 beginning
teachers were placed. Last year the Bureau placed 178 students,

The mystery surrounding the
locked door session poses two
questions concerning the disrupted
Faculty Rating‘ program. Can the
committee pre-,test the program this
semester and install it throughout
the University next spring‘ as-was
reviousl announced?
P Y
Although no reporter was present
during the. closed portion of the
meeting, Dick Kovar stated_follow-
ing the meeting that Miss N,unes
requested that she be relieved of
the committee chairmanship and
that the committee be dissolved.
(C , ,
She wanted to let the original
program ride and work toward an
eventual’ faculty-administered pro.
gram. After a lengthy, aimless dis-

cussion, the matter was tabled
indefinitely, with two members
dissenting, 'Kovar said.

Flora Diemert, president of Con-
gress, said later that two of the
five members of the committee to
meet with the Student Faculty Re-
lations Committee of the University
Seiiate have been appointed.

I have appointed Carol Nunes
and Phyllis Beck to the committee
requested by Congress,” Mists
Diemert said. "l’ll appoint the
other three later.”

when there were 906 vacancies,

leges)reported to them by 15 states.

For the first time in years there
is an oversupply of high school
teachers, according to Mr. George
W. Hoffman, head of the Bureau.

mand for elementary teachers.

Mr. Hoffman_advises students
that‘ more high school jobs are
available in the surrounding area
than in the city. ‘Actually, the
Bureau does little business with
local schools because they have
easy access to student records.
Also, many students interested
in local positions make their own
contract.

Since schools send to the Bur-
eau for student credentials a great
deal of paper work is connected
with placement. The Bureau must
make six copies of each Educa-
tion student's credentials. Extra
secretaries are always needed dur-
ing the pre -graduation season.

However, there is still a great de-i

dent as a reward.

him and said,’« "Do you mind if I

But Mr. Kapff doesn't need this
kind of appreciation to realize the

year ending in June, 1949, he
handled 18,733 transactions, the
total including items turned in,
items returned, and inquiries about
lost articles.

Sleuthing Involved

Sometimes returning an article to
its owner involves a little sleuthing.
For instance, when Mr. Kapff re-
ceives a high school‘ ring, he can
contact the school indicated on the
ring and trace the owner through
records of that year’s class if ini-

tials are present on the ring.
-In order to reduce the number of
unreturned articles. and provide a
more effective service, Mr. Kapff

quainted with his office and its
function. ~ ’

The office is located on the
Ground Floor, room G-58 with the
Post Office, and is open from 8:30
to 12 and 1 to 5 each day except
Saturday when it closes at noon.
The telephone number is Ext. 230.

Books Stray Most

The largest percentage of items
turned in are textbooks and note-
books. This Fall, 100 books were
turned over to the Book Store, none
of them containingiany kind of in-
formation leading to tracing the
owners. Mr. Kapff advises all /stu-
deuts to mark their names and ad-
dresses on any items they are liable
to misplace in the school buildings,
especially books.

of Student Congress, Chairman Ray
Maher has revealed. i ’

The 32 undergraduate Studentg
from abroad have virtually no con-
tact with activities on campus;
One organization, the International
Relations Club under president Jo‘-
seph Funfar, has tried to remedy
this. However, since the club is
‘quite small, the foreign students‘
committee plans to help promote
its activities. -

Several other plans have been
‘formulated by the Student Congress
committee. These include a plan
for housing foreign students with
American students in the.men’s
dorms and fraternity houses.

Ned Mclntosh, assistant to the
dean of men, has also announced
plans for a new association, a
foreign students club, to be or-gan-

"I was having lunch with three
students on Oct. 15, 1948. One was

Lambda Chi
Squeaks by

In Thriller

A quick comeback marked with
fast breaking plays spelled the
difference as the Lambda Chi’s
downed the Pi Lambda Phi’s,
37-34, on Tuesday.

The Trees gym game saw the
Pi Lams shutting out the opposi-
tion, 7-0, at the end of the first
quarter.

The game continued in slow
form, and all indications pointed
to "just another game” as the
half ended with a score of 15-9, Pi
Lams on top.

The third quarter started and so
did the Lambda Chi team. The
teamwork of Sam Albano and the
shooting of Tom Lokasczcyk put
the Lambda Chi’s on the end of a
surprising 25-23 lead at the three
quarter mark.

The fourth quarter saw a see-saw
battle all the way, with the lead
constantly changing. With one
minute to play, a ‘fast-breaking
manuever set up a shot by Lokas-
czcyk to break a tie. His mates
then stiffened their defense and
after making a foul shot, held con-
trol of the ba1l,throughout the
last 30 seconds.

YMCA hoopsters caged‘ their

day night at the expense of the

Off this victory the Y seemed the
best bet to triumph in the spirited
intramural National League race.

Trailing at the half in a low-
scoring game, 12-7, the Y steadily
outscored the Raiders to move out
front and stay there until the final
whistle had sounded.

The Raiders showed a tight first
half defense, keeping the two Y
sharpshooters, Heinie Harris and
Dave Dietterich, silent throughout
the first 16 minutes.

Panther Shooting Erratic,
Tartans Break Long Jinx

, By WILL DOERGE

It has been a common complaint of the Pitt fan that Dr. H.C.
Carlson's basketball team fails to shoot.

The Panthers answered their critics Wednesday night against
Carnegie Tech at the Stadium, but their efforts only produced a
wild and ineffectual shooting display.

Carnegie Tech took advantage
of their height_and Pitt's wildness
to come off with a 62-42 victory,
the Tartans’ first since the 1941-42
season over a Panther five.

Grove City Vulnerable
If Pitt entertains any hopes of
winning another game this season,
it is because of the Grove City
encounter here next Tuesday. The
Grovers have a one and four re-
cord to show for the year, com-
paring favorably to Pitt’-s one and
five card.
Against the Plaid -- still the
~ Plaid despite black and white
uniforms -— Pitt took '78 shots at
the basket and made only 18 for
a woeful shooting average of 22
per cent.
Closer Than It Appears
The game was much closer than
the final score would indicate.
With less than seven minutes to
play, the Panthers were as close
as 46-42, but in the remaining time,
they failed to score a single point.
Pitt had to do most of its shoot-
ing from the outside simply be-
cause Big Mike Theodore had the
middle well bottled up, and the

Tankers Sink

Break Five Pool Records

By STAN SKILBOLL

For a team supposedly out of
shape, the Pitt swimmers did quite
well for themselves, Wednesday
when they defeated’ Westminster,
52-14, at New Wilmington, and set
five new pool records.

Individual records were set by
Dick Petro (100-yard free style),
Jim Zentgraf (220-yard free style),
and Don Wilde (60-yard free style).

The medley relay team of Al
Baran, Bob Gover, and Julius Mel-
ograne, and the 400-yard free style
relay boys also broke pool records.

The 400-yard relay tearr, com-
posed of Zentgraf, Wilde, Melograne,
and Petro beat the old pool time by
11 seconds. '

Out of eight events, fhe Pitt
tankers failed to garner a first
place in only one race -- the 40-
yard free style. By that time, the
Panthers were ahead, 41-9, and
Coach Ben Grady pulled his ace
distance man, Jim Zentgraf, in
order to save him for the 440-yard
relay.

Although they broke no records,
Herb Leibovitz took a first in the
150-yard back stroke, and Bob
Prouser led the 220-yard breast-
stroke.

Although there was no official
diving at Westminster, Al Ciocca
and Captain Bill Cochran put on
an exhibition for the crowd. Be-
cause of the low ceiling, which
prevented the diving event in the
first place, the two Pitt boys came
away with a variety of scratches.

Wrestlers Mix

With Lock Haven

3)" JOHN ME-TIELLA

Pitt's wrestlers, a willing group
of pupils,‘ will take their next
grappling lesson from capable
teachers tomorrow at the Stadium
at 2 p.m. when they hook up with
Lock Haven Teachers.

The Panthers, who are learning
wrestling from the mat up, are
figured to lose to the veteran Lock
Haven team. Conditioning, keen
interest, and willingness to learn,
which the Blue and Gold matmen
have displayed thus far, isn't
reckoned to compensate for the
lack of experience and offset the
superiority of the visitors.

Meeting Champs

Last yearl.ock Haven was cham-
pion among state teacher colleges.
And advance notices say that this
yeat’s team is as strong as last
year’s.

Tomorrow, Coach Rex Peery ex-
pects to start the same team that
competed against Ohio State. On
this team are two grapplers who
experienced their first varsity com-
petition last week.Morris Schratter,
wrestling at 155 pounds, and Bill
Johnston, a 175-pound sophomore,
saw their first college action at
Columbus.

Rest are “Vets"

By comparison the remaining
members of the team are "vet-
erans”, having taken part in all
three collegiate meets. Mainstay
of the team is Doc Conklin, Pitt's
undefeated 165 pounder. Conklin
has two decisions and a fall to
his credit.

Sports Editor

son camp to pick up our toothpicks
and go to bat for the good doctor.
To put it ,mildly and with as
much restraint as possible, Dr.
Carlson is an oasis of genius in
,a sport gone stale and sterile
:with mental anaemia. He has al-
ways been and every day con-
tinues to be a source of fresh
‘jthought. His Figure Eight is only
[one of a number of creations which
caused the nation’s coaches to
‘select him as the man who con-
tributed most to the sport in 19-48.

«Of course,- all this is fine and
dandy, but can Figure Eight con-
tinuity win games, people want to
know? ’

_We of the Carlson school say
certainly. ,

The Doctor’s offense is a thing
of science planned at getting the
ball to the strings by a carefully
charted route rather than by guiding
it/ there under the influence of
whimsical drivers following their
nose." With material, H.C. could
prove the point.

The Cincinnati club which lost
to Duquesne at the Gardens Tues-
- day night needed just that extra
bit of planning to beat the Dukes.
They did not have it. They would
h-ave had it under Carlson. A

Their trouble seemed to

side Duquesn’e’s big men — part-
icularly Charley Cooper of the

Their muscles may be growing a
little stiffer, their eyes getting a
little dimmer, but the Faculty Die-
T «bards have refused to throw in the

towel. , *
 ’As their name implies, the Die-
hards are composed of faculty mem-
bers here at Pitt who still like to
swat a softball, loop a long set
shot, or drive a volleyball off an
opponent’s noggin.
' The men who give with the know-
ledge were first organized last
spring and-competed in the IM soft-
‘ball league. The brains behind the
outfit is Louis Hough, assistant

‘professor of statistics, who doubles
’ as manager and captain of the
basketball team.

llelps Waistlines

Hough points out that the team
“‘wasn’t organized with the idea of
reducing bulging waistlines, though
it does help, but with the purpose
of having fun and winning ball
«games.

So far, the Diehards have stuck
pretty close to their purpose. They
made a good showing in softball
“and the basketball team is pre-
sently leading the IM, American

, Inasmuch as Pitt’s basketball squad appears to be on its way
to a losing season, the critics of Dr. H.C. Carlson's Figure Eight
offense should go to town with spats on.

By the same token, now is the time for we soldiers of the Carl-

 

Naturally, they fell apart.

I submit that with a thorough
knowledge of continuity they could
have had the strong but slower
Dukes mixed up like a Student
Congress.

It is the good fortune of Pitt's
basketball players that they have
the opportunity to pick up this
knowledge. Down through the years
there have been many of Carl~son’s
players ‘who have done a lot of
extra-curricular grumbling, but that
is only because anything worth
learning requires brain strain.

Idea Man

Unfortunately, that is a fault of
athletics in general. Too many
expect everything to be sheer joy.

Now I do not subscribe to every
tactic which Carlson employs. But,
then, great men are almost always
disputable figures. They have so
many ideas that you can’t possibly
go down the line with them.

Yet the fact that Carlson is an
idea man points up the excellent
training opportunity which his
players have -- particularly those
who have coaching ambition-s.

No, I can’t agree that this is the
year to jump on Doc Carlson's back.
We’d just bounce back off the bril-
liance. ‘

League with three straight wins.
-And most important of_all, they
are'having fun, even though there
is plenty of acning joints the day
‘after a game.

National Invitation Vet

Only two men" on the hoop team
have had any college experience,

Paul Lohmeyer, advisor to stu-
dent publications, was a regular
center under Doc Carlson in 1943.
Bob Miller, assistant track coach,
who hasn’t been able to play any
games as yet, was a member of
the Rhode Island State squad that
featured Ernie Calvery and played
in the National Invitational Tourn-
ament in Madison Square Garden
during the war.

Good Cross-Section

The rest of the team has had high
school and independent ball ex-
perience. Those who have been
playing regularly are:

Dr. William Ruhe, assistant pro-
fessor of mechanical engineering,
..Edwin McIntosh, assistant to the
Dean of Men, Dr. William Frasure,
associate professor of accounting,
and Cameron Satterthwaite, re-
search assistant in chemistry.

"We have a good sized team,”
says Hough. And after walking into
his office and finding on top of a
desk a pair of gym‘ shoes that
looked as if they were about size 13,
a pair of gym trunks that appeared
as if they would give a young Se-
quoia tree a tight feeling around
the. middle, andithen looking down
and seeing the Diehards’ manager
himself, all 5-4 of him, there was

no doubts about the above state-
ment.

Extra Effort?

Asked whether the teams they
play. against give a little extra
effort because they. are playing
against the faculty, Hough replied.

"I hate to ruin your story by say-
ing no, but I’m afraid they don’t.”
