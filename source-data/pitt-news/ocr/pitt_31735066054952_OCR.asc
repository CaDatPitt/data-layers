Student Government Board presidential candidates from left to right; George Mongell, Christopher Boback and Shavon
Ogunleye, discuss the issues pertinent to this year's election. The election takes place Wednesday at various campus locations.

Whether the issue was food ser- .

vices or campus safety, candidates
for Student Government Board presi-
dent all offered the same ideas during
their debate last night. .

Indeed, the only area where
George Mongell, Shavon Ogunleye
and Christopher Boback had con-
trasting views was that of reforming
the process of allocating the student
activities fee to campus groups.

SGB president Alyson Wallach
asked the candidates for their reac-
tion to avproposal to move Pittsfoot-
ball to the Steeler’s new stadium on
the North Side and how the candi-
dates would represent ‘the students’
opinions to administration.

Mongell said he would conduct
student surveys and take the results
to University administration. If those
results were ignored, he said, he
would_advocate boycotting games to
send the message.

He expressed concern about
whether drunk students could make
their way back to campus safely and
also the loss of school spirit.

“Tradition at the University is.

very‘ powerful and we could lose
that,” he said. Safety and tradition, he
said, are imperative ingredients in a
satisfying college experience.

Ogunleye said she has talked to
many students who are against’mov-
ing the football program. She would
conduct surveys of the entire student
body to “see exactly where we
stand.”

She also said she would engage in
an active campaign to inform stu-
dents of the proposal, “something
that doesn’t happen all the time.” Her
campaign would involve posters, rep-
resentatives sent to student groups

for discussion, and petitions present- ’

ed to administrators. __

Boback said he, too, would con-
duct opinion polls, much like those
for the proposal that let students ride

.Port Authority buses by showing

~

their ID cards. Those results would
be forwarded to University adminis-
tration. _

All three candidates agreed that
SGB has the authority to change
aspects of Pitt’s food services that
students find disagreeable, despite
that fact that students have tradition-
ally had very little say over prices
and the number of blocks a meal plan
offers. I

“Anything that affects the student
body is something the Student
Government Board should have
authority on,” Ogunleye said.

She would conduct surveys to
find out what specific complaints stu-
dents have and present her findings ‘to
administration’. She said she would-
make sure that meal plan changes
occur when students are on campus,
so they would have an opportunity to
voice their concerns.

To address student complaints,
Boback said he would organize meet-

The Taste That

Workers rally oulsi

  chancellor's

Erin Lindeman
Senlor Staff Writer

Union workers from Pitt-
Johnstown protested their lack of a
contract in front of Chancellor Mark
Nordenberg’s _house Saturday mom-
mg.

The workers from the Johnstown
campus have been without a contract
for more than two years, said John
Listisen, the Service Employees
International Union’s director of orga-
nizing. Pitt’s maintenance workers
belong to SEIU’s Local 29 unit.

Listisen said the workers are will-
ing to take the new health insurance
that Pitt has offered them. However, in
return, Pitt expects them to’ pay a 35-
percent increase, which would result
in their paying $61 a month for fami-
ly coverage and $30 a month for indi-
vidual coverage.

In addition, Pitt wants the workers
in the union to agree to a two—tier
wage system for new employees,
allowing Pitt to pay a utility worker $2
less per hour than the current wage
rate. ‘

“[The two-tier wage system] vio-
lates the principle of equal pay for
equal work,” said Listisen.

Pitt Spokesman, Ken Service, said

the University and workers are in the
midst/of collective bargaining.

“We have offered a contract,” he
said. “The union workers aren’t
accepting our offer.”

Service said the demands being
made by the Johnstown workers
exceed the terms of the agreement that
Local 29 members on the Pittsburgh
campus already have accepted. The
Johnstown area has a lower cost of
living and a higher unemployment
rate than the Pittsburgh area. .

“At this point, [the contract]
we’ve offered is fair and comparable,”
Service said.

Approximately 50 workers and
supporters of the union from the
Johnstown area arrived at the chancel-

So what does a former Pitt chancellor
do?

On Friday afternoon, the Honors
College held its weekly lecture series and
answered that question. Wesley Posvar,
chancellor from 1967-91, spoke on

“Planning Challenges in the New Global’

Age.
Posvar, aided by an overhead and
watched by a group of 20 people, discussed
ekistics, or the “science of human settle-
ments.” ‘
“But it is more
than that,” said Posvar.
“It is also about urban
planning and global-‘

ly call it a science,
though. It’s as much a
science as political sci-
ence, econornics or
history.”

Posvar still works
at Pitt and is active in
the Pittsburgh commu-
nity. He will be teach-
ing a graduate course
in international politics
next semester.

_ In the late 1950s,
Posvar was one of 200
“brilliant and young”
minds that gathered in

He Said

Posvar also said he believes the leaders
of big industry in each city should talk to
each other and let each other know what
they’re planning.

According to Posvar, ekistics helps
with the ‘planning of new cities and facili-
ties.

“New York and Washington, D.C., —
these two cities have beneﬁted immensely
from the foresight that our forefathers had,”
Posvar said. “Look at Central Park. It has
so much value in a city of that size. Imagine

the cost of trying to place a park like -that in V

a city today. Both cities‘ have logical grid
' systems that make it
i so easy to navigate.
Now, Los Angeles

_ Posvar, Doxiadis was preoccupied with the

ills of city life. He thought the village for-
mat — where everything from family to

 food was within walldng distance —was

the perfect living unit.
Posvar commented on this, saying,

-- “One of the worst places to live is just north

of here, in Cranberry. Everything, even a

-. grocery store, must be driven to. And even
' then, it takes at least 15 minutes to drive.

You can’t walk anywhere.”
Posvar has been adamant in '
Pittsburgh and Cleveland.
“Pittsburgh and Cleveland are very
similar cities,” he said. “They were both

Posvar also spoke about the logic

behind ekistics, saying the driving force for -

the architects and sociologists is that they
become captivated by the logic of planning.

“Anyone that has travelled to Europe
can see the beneﬁts of urban planning — it
just makes sense,” he said. V

is that the minds that originally plarmed for
the future are all in their seventies.

“We either need to revive this idea or
make a memorial for it,” he said. “I, of

seeking out minds for another gathering.

RALLY

Now!”, “The people united will never
be defeated,” “Union’s got the power
 power by the hour,” and “Two, four,
six, eight — why won’t Mark negoti-
ate?”

Ellen Boggs, head negotiator for
the A University, spoke with union
members the day before the protest.

According to Pitt-Jlohnstown shop
steward, Tim Campagna, Boggs
requested the workers not walk, say-
ing it might affect future negotiations.

Listisen said that although the
workers were asked not to protest,
they decided to anyway.

“We don’t care if we hurt his feel-
ings,” he said. “We’re tired of him
telling us no.”

Members of Pitt’s International
Socialist Organization and Students in
Solidarity, as well as members of
Pennsylvania’s Social Services Union,
joined in the protest.

Pitt’s ISO members held signs
saying, “Pitt students support SEIU.”

Campagna, said the purpose of the

protest was to show Nordenberg the

workers’ loyalty. _

“We’re here to let him know that
we’re still here even without a con-
tract,” Campagna said.

Workers at Pitt’s main campus
agreed to a three-year contract in late
August. During that period, the work-
ers will receive a 3-percent increase

over their previous pay, as well as var-
ious medical benefits provided by

The Pitt—Johnstown workers also
picketed at the Pitt football game

against Boston College. ‘After the

game, numerous protesters returned to

the chancellor’s house, which was set
up for a picnic. ’

agers, employees and school admin-
istrators. He would also conduct sur-
veys of student concerns, post ﬂiers
broadcasting important information
and ensure that meal plan changes
occur only when students are on cam-
pus. T

, Mongell also suggested surveys
and meetings with administrators.
The key, he said, is to put pressure on
the people who control the process.

“Persistent action, that’s what
you have to have,” he said.

The candidates saw eye-to-eye on
the issue of enhancing communica-
tion between students, faculty and
student government. They would all
send representatives to student orga-
nization meetings and open the board
to a more diverse cross se'ction of the
student population. / '

As far as improving campus safe-
ty, all three candidates advocated
working with the Pitt po1ice,- whom
they said are willing to share infor-
mation and work with students.
Ogunleye said she wants to see more
lighting and police patrols in South
Oakland; Mongell said he wants to
publicize resources Pitt offers to help
students deal with safety issues; and

FROM PAGE 1

Boback suggested more forums, pos-
sibly conducted with the Counselling
Center and the Campus Women’.s
Organization, to discuss safety.

All three candidates agreed that a
noticeable problem with the current

SGB is that the board does not reach
out to enough students, which hin-
ders the level of student participa-
tion. '

“Only once in a while do I see a
new, fresh face [at SGB meetings],”

It was only on the issue of alloca-
tions reform that the candidates dif-
fered. ‘ '

“They have no clue what organi-
zations really need,” Ogunleye said
of allocations committee members.

To rectify that problem, she advo-
cated an open-door policy in which‘

‘members of student organizations

would feel free to approach commit-
tee members to explain their needs
and learn how the allocations process
works.

Mongell said there should be no
open-door policy. Rather, he said
members of the allocations commit-
tee should go directly to the students
to answer their questions and explain,
the funding process. “

-Boback, the current allocations
committee chairman, said that there
already is an open-door policy and
that committee -members go to the
student groups on a regular basis.

The problem, he said, is -that stu-
dents expect too much from the
process.‘ For instance, SGB had
$300,000 to distribute this fiscal
year, but student groups entered
requests totalling $600,000, Boback
said. ,

“I personally don’t see anything
that’s wrong with the system right
now,” he said. 0

Charisma, not issues, will p
decide SGB presidential victor

The Student Government Board
presidential candidate debate held
Monday night in the William Pitt
Union ballroom proved one thing:
Candidates Christopher Boback,
George Mongell and Shavon
Ogunleye agree on most issues and
have similar ideas on how to address
them. ‘

VV1th this in mind, it appears that
voters will have to look beyond the
issues to the candidates themselves. If
you’re going to vote on issues, you
might as well ﬂip a coin. In this elec-
tion, personality and each candidate’s
resume is going to count for an awful
lot. ‘

Voters will have to look at the lit-
tle things. Notice how each speciﬁc
question was answered by the candi-
dates. Notice the candidates’ rrranner,
conﬁdence and how they used their
own personal strengths to tackle ques-
tions posed to them. Bear in mind, one
of these three will be your SGB presi-
dent for a year. Choose the candidate
you think is best suited to be a leader,
not the issues they’re ﬁring off.

Boback used his credentials as
allocations committee chairman to
looked informed on issues relating to
allocations (particularly the way he
responded to criticism that some stu-
dent groups weren’t being allocated

money for refreshments at their
events).

While Boback and Ogunleye both
passed on several rebuttals, Mongell
made a wise move by using his allot-
ted minute to his advantage. Though
not the strongest speaker, he delivered
the goods at the right time. Knowing
when to step in and use his resources,
in this case, made up for that weakness.

Ogunleye has comrrranding pres-
ence, with a forceful rrranner and clear
determination. Though she has been
criticized for closed—mindedness, she is
a strong character and a great orator.

Ogunleye‘ also knew when an issue"

had been. talked to death, passing on
topics that needed no further discus-
sion.

As their answers to the question of
what they would do about raising stu-
dent concerns about the possible move
of the football team to the North Side
proved, Boback, Mongell and
Ogunleye are blending together on the
issues. All three recommended taking
student surveys then relaying them to
the administration. 4 -

Issues appear to have become

peripheral in this election. With all '

three presidential candidates saying

practically the same thing, but with a 7

dilferent spin, it appears the most
charismatic will win.

Anyone ambling through the heart of
Oakland is bound to notice one of Forbes
AVenue’s most prominent features: panhan-
dlers. Homeless people are as much a part
of Forbes as the “O” and the masses of
speeding traffic. You don’t have to like
them, you don’t have to appreciate their
way of life, and you don’t even have to give
them your spare change. What you can give
them is a break.

One of the greatest things about living
in America is that we have the right to
exercise our free will. We all have choices
to make. Some of us grow up to be doctors,
lawyers, preachers, business owners,
schoolteachers  and some of us grow up
to be panhandlers. Not every person on a
street corner is there out of his own will,
but for some, panhandling is a chosen
lifestyle. 4

Americans frown upon it, but
in some cultures, begging is a
respectable way of life. For exarn—
ple, ascetics in India shed all of
their material possessions, except for a sim-
ple cloth robe and a bowl for collecting
rice, because they believe that denouncing
all things worldly will bring them closer to
enlightenment. The ascetics are highly
respected for their religious dedication
within the Indian culture.

It’s unlikely ‘that even one of ‘the
Oakland panhandlers is an ascetic on a
great religious quest. But one can be certain
that some, if not a majority, of the homeless
occupying Forbes Avenue are there because
they have chosen to be. There could be a
variety of reasons for selecting this
lifestyle, such as the desire to make a social
statement and rebel against “the system,” a‘
hunger for freedom, wanderlust or pure
laziness. Regardless of the motivation, if
someone chooses begging as a way of life,
this choice should be respected as much as
someone’s decision to become a scientist, a
professor,‘ a factory worker or any other
societally approved occupation.

The judgement call of whether or not
panhandling is a demoralizing way to live
life is not ours to make. If you think that
begging is degrading and dishonorable,

Even panhandlers clserve respect

then work hard, stay in school, get a “real”
job, and enjoy your comfortable lifestyle.
But that doesn’t mean that others have to
conform to your perception of the good
life.

Also consider the fact that some people
are forced into destitution by circumstances
beyond their control. It really could happen
to anybody. No one is immune to freak
accidents, deaths in the family, poor finan-
cial management or any of the other hun-

dreds of factors that can lead to sudden’

poverty. For those too proud to depend on
welfare and with nowhere else to turn, beg-
ging may be the only solution. Without a
permanent address, v an appropriate
wardrobe or proper education and training,
it may not be so easy to get a job.

That’s not to say there’s absolutely
nothing the motivated panhan-
dler can do to improve his situ-
ation, but chances are that at
least part of the reason why he’s
on the street is because of sim-
ple bad luck, circumstances he couldn’t
control. Don’t feel the need to weep tears of
pity for every homeless person you meet
with a hard-luck story, but keep in mind
that you really don’t know a man until
you’ve walked a mile in his shoes.

It’s still. your personal choice as to
whether or not you want to toss your spare
change to any street person who happens to
ask you for it. If you like your shiny quar-
ters, then keep them nice and safe in your
pockets. If you think that the homeless are
greatly distracting from the aesthetic beau-
ty of Forbes Avenue, then just look straight
ahead, and pretend you can’t see them, or
else walk up a different street. _

But if you want to criticize begging as
a valid lifestyle, stop for a second, step off
your pedestal of moral superiority,_and give
these guys some credit for living their lives
in a way that, according to their personal
standards, may be perfectly respectable and
desirable. Think about this the next time

that someone asks you to spare a dime.

6N¢l'I'IlI'¢l"y unco

Stephen May
columnist

I think David Bowie is a genius. It’s
hard for me to believe that no one thought of
the whole “roc ’n’roll chameleon” thing
before he did, because it was such a brilliant
idea The reason being -— except for the
jocks out there whose wardrobe only
changes with the new football or baseball
dynasty, and the other square pegs out there
—— we’re all charneleons. Please allow me to
use myself as a sacriﬁcial lamb, of sorts, here
to illustrate my point

I am, by nature, uncool. When God or
Satan or whatever was handing out the cool
genes, he (or it) made a point of skipping
me. For some reason, maybe because I was
born uncool, I’ ve spent a large portion of my
life trying very hard to achieve coolness. It
goes back a very long way.

Back in the ﬁrst grade, when nylon
“parachute” breakdance pants were all the
rage, I had a pair (though the closest I ever
got to breakdancing was spinning around on
my back on the wooden gym ﬂoor).

Also, I had two spiked bracelets and two

. spiked belts from J .C. Penney’s. I thought I

was quite the punk rock six-year-old and that
all the girls would love me. But the fact of
the matter was that 6-year-olds do not wear
spiked bracelets. The girls and boys both
laughed at me, and I was back to the draw-
ing board

I fell back into the “let my mom pick out '

my clothes” thing for a while. It was easier,
and everyone else was doing it My mom
didn’t do a bad job, except for on the armual
picture day, when she forced me to wear
dress pants and one of the itchy wool
sweaters my grandmother had sent me for
Christmas. I tried to tell her that it was way
too hot for sweaters and that it didn’t matter
what kind of pants I was wearing because no
one would see my pants anyway. But she
wouldn’t listen.

On soccer picture day, I
tried once again to take mat-
ters into my own hands. It
was considered very cool
back then, in the stone-age
eighties, to wear one’s shorts
over one’s sweatpants (see the
movie “Goonies” for evi-
dence if you don’t believe
me). So when I was getting
ready, I slid my pair of soccer
shorts over my soccer sweatpants.

It was a brilliant fashion move, I
thought. My mom thought I’d lost my mind
and demanded that I take them oﬂ’. But I
wasn’t going to back down. After one of the
most epic ﬁghts in the history of my family
and in one of the greatest coups in my own
short history, I was allowed to have my soc-
cer picture taken wearing my shorts over my
sweatpants.

I do realize that somewhere I went
astray and got off the whole “we’re all
chameleons” thing. Let’s fast forward to

  
  

_ .4

1991, when things got really crazy.

When I was 13, I decided I’d had
enough of not being cool. I ﬁgured I was a
pretty good—looking guy, I was pretty outgo-
ing  why not me? ‘

So the summer before the eighth grade,
I stocked up: white 501 jeans with the button
ﬂy — two pairs — a black “button your ﬂy”
T—shirt, Nike jogging shoes, several Nike T-

shirts and a few other sports T-shirts. '

(Neverrnind the fact that I
was always the last picked in
gym class and had about as
much coordination as the
average 21st birthday cele-
brant at 2am) Also, I per-
fected the art of “pegging”

never do it as well as the cool
ldds, but at least I tried

And the fact of.the matter
’ was, even though I might
have looked cooler than the cool kids, I was
still me. Uncool me.

_. Whatldecidedto do then wasjust “be
myse .” Of course, at that point, “myself’
was still very much undeveloped, so I just
made something up. I won’t go into details,
but suﬂice it to say that I clean—shaved the
sides of my head, bought a pair of loafers
from. the local Florsheim, started wearing
turtlenecks under button-down shirts, started
wearing nrbber bands around my wrists, and
a Jesus Jones T-shirt

That was myself back in 1991-92.

my jeans. Granted, I could»

ol since Ihe clay I was born

Ridiculous? Yes. Cool? Certainly not. But a
few girls inexplicably found my new style
cool, and tl1at’s all you can really ask for as a
heterosexual guy.

That really wasn ’t a very good example
of me being a chameleon. But then, was
David Bowie really being a chameleon
when, in his Aladin Sane stage, he covered
himself in white grease paint and painted a
red lightning bolt across his face? Probably
not But I digress.

The last thing I’m going discuss is,
when, at age 16, in a particularly unusual
moment, I let my girlﬁiend shave my head.
My dad told me I could pack up my things
and leave. I decided to go for a walk

I wasn’t really sure about the head-shav-
ing thing, even as my head was being
shaved. It wasn’t like I was being an individ-
ual because head-shaving was all the rage.
Michael Stipe had just unveiled his shaven
‘head a short month before.

It crossed my mind that night when I
was 16 and going forawalkthatthefactthat
I shaved my head had very little to do with
being cool (I’ll never be cool) or being a
chameleon (yes, at one point, this column
was about being a chameleon). It had every-
thing to do with having the ﬁeedom to shave
my head.

Stephen May says: If you want to learn
about Glam, buy a copy of Ziggy Stardust or
Y1Rexs “Electric Warrior: ” Horrible trendy
movies are bad for your health.

Au revoir Newt— I'm gonna miss you  

Michael Berquist
columnist

I ‘still ﬁnd it a little hard to accept.
When you lose ‘someone, it’s a hard thing,
but this is even worse. But I guess I had
better come to grips with the truth:

I won’t have Newt, Gingrich to kick
around anymore.

Gingrich’s resignation from Congress
and his relinquishment of the speaker’s
chair in the House of Representatives, in
the wake of the Republican party’s dismal
showing in the 1998 elections, has touched
off a major struggle for control of the
Republican leadership and a series of eval-
uations of Gingrich’s record as speaker.
Some, including Republicans Gingrich
referred to as “cannibals,” praise Gingrich

V p as an intellectual ahead of his time. Less

biased observers offer a more objective
view of a man who promised and dreamed
much yet delivered very little.

-Gingrich was a former history profes-
sor, elected to Congress in 1978. He
worked his way up through the ranks of the
Republican Party quicldy, with a pledge to
reverse its seemingly endless travails in the
minority by aggressively attacking the
Democrats by any means necessary. His
view of America’s‘ past and future, in
which he admired conservatives for being

“visionary,” was more a product of sci‘-
ence-ﬁction fantasy than an actual exami-
nation of historical fact.

On the heels of the dramatic 1994
election, Gingrich spoke grandly of the
“sweep of history” and of how his
Republicans would begin a wholesale
reorganization of the American govem-
ment and of the political landscape. Now,
with 1999 almost upon us, Republicans
worry‘ about losing control of the Congress
in 2000 and facing defeat in a third straight
presidential election. The explanation for
how Republicans could have failed so dra-
matically begins with their speaker.

Gingrich was less the visionary of the
future than an egocentric backbencher
unﬁt for the responsibilities that come with

being a statesman. He argued that a moth- .
er drowning her two small children in-

South Carolina was a symptom of the wel-
fare state. (An interesting argument, con-
sidering that the mother was the step-
daughter of an incestuous, religious right
leader active in Republican politics.) In a
temper tantrum, Newt closed down the
government -in 1995 to punish President
Clinton for giving him a bad seat on a
ﬂight aboard Air Force One. ‘

He was a back-stabbing ideologue
whose angry war against the Democratic

majority in Congress alienated moderate

Republicans and

turned Congress into a tense war zone, bit-
terly divided between the two parties. The
irony was that the tactics he so assiduously
taught to his disciples have led to his
ouster. As columnist Jonathan Alter noted:
“Loudmouths were once relegated to the
back bench; Gingrich proved that vitriol
could fuel real advancement. Having
watched the speaker stab his way up, what
was to stop younger members from trying
the same? Like many revolutionaries,
Gingrich planted the seeds of his own
demise.”

Time and again, Gingrich and the
Republicans failed to deliver on their
promises. He pledged to reorganize the
federal bureaucracy. They failed to close
any executive department, and their reor-
ganization of the Congress consisted most-
ly of cutting Democratic staﬂ"s. Now that
they enjoy the beneﬁts of being the major-
ity, you cannot expect the Republicans to
give up perks like huge staffs and expense
accounts, can you? The Republican major-
ity failed to deliver on the balanced budget
amendment. They failed to deliver on term
limits. They talked about simplifying the
tax code but added 824 new items to it in
1997,  it a bigger and inﬁnitely
more complex document. Bigger govem-

ment? Was this what Newt promised us?

Most Republicans hold up the bal-
anced budget as a victory for the Gingrich
agenda, yet Bill Clinton had already begun
to close the budget deﬁcit in 1993 and
1994 with a Democratic Congress. Odd
that the Republicans twiddled their thumbs
for 12 years when they held the White
House and only recently became advocates
for ﬁscal restraint. It was Republicans, and
their insistence upon budget-busting
defense items the Department of Defense
has professed to not needing, who nearly
sent America reeling into ﬁscal calamity.

I pity Bob Livingston, the new speak-
er-to-be. Controlling the cabal of uncom-
promising ideologues Newt unleashed in
1994 may prove to be the headache of a
lifetime. The irony is that Gingrich may
end up successfully reorganizing the
American political landscape — behind a
cohesive Democratic party committed to
smaller but more compassionate govem-
ment. In their zeal to realize Newt’s dream,

the Republicans run the risk of painting _ 

themselves off the political canvas. .

THE PITT Nsws: OPINIONS

The Pitt News horoscope — your future revealed

Andrea Woessner

Columnlst

This article in no way, shape or form
reﬂects the viewpoints of The Pitt News and
should not be taken seriously. If you con-
duct your life according to what you read in
an opinions column, you’re very silly and
should probably get involved with the
Student Government Board.

Q —You may as well dig a hole in
the ground and hide there for the duration of
the month; the stars predict an incredibly
crummy November for you. On the bright
side, you’ll ﬁnd a quarter on the sidewalk
and you’ll make friends with the Hari
Krishnas. .

Taurus — Be careful this month when
crossing Fifth Avenue. The stars are aligned

in such a manner that you will get smeared
across the street by a PAT bus if you’re not

.wary. Be especially cautious around men in

khaki trench coats  someone may have it

in for you. . .
Gc;_m_ir_Ii — If you have any major trav-

iel plans for the month, it’s best to cancel

them. Your car will break down,’ your plane

 crash, and you will be immediately

tagged an ignorant tourist and promptly
mugged or thrown in jail for crimes you
didn’t commit against people you’ve never
met. The U.S. Embassy can’t help you.
You’ll be shot at sunrise the following
morning, and your last thoughts will be,

“Well, at least I’m not in the cell with that
love-hungry, baboon any longer. Man, I
should’ve listened to 

Cancer —— Go to as many shows and
concerts as you like; you have the stars’
blessing. If you mosh, you’ll come outwith
several large, cool-looking bruises you can
show off and brag about. If you hang out
near the back, you’ll get four or ﬁve phone
numbers just because you’re so adorable. If
you loiter by the stage doors, you’ll get to
meet the band, and tlrey’l1 be so impressed
by you that they’ll write a song about how‘
cool you are or dedicate their next album to
you.
. Leg — Any hook—ups that you make
this month with a Capricorn or an Aries are
doomed; try to ﬁnd a nice Gemini instead.
Needless to say, your love life is going to be
aggravating this month. Donate the time
you would spend dating to social projects.
It’s probably about time to adjust your
karma again or rack up more brownie
points in heaven, anyway. Volunteer your
time and energy to at least two worthwhile
projects. Help a struggling classmate with
his work Help a squirrel ﬁnd some nuts to
store for winter (extra credit if you help it to
bury the nuts).

ﬁrgg — Yes, you’re right. They are
out to get you.

LJ_)_r__a —- Unless you send me $20 in a
plain envelope, your pet will bite you, you’ll
get a lousy haircut, you’ll stub your toe,

you’ll fall asleep in class and start drooling
and snoring, you’ll get carded, you’ll rip
your favorite pants, you’ll slam your ﬁngers
in a door, you’ll’ scratch a CD, you’ll loose
your keys, you’ll ﬂunk a midterm, your new
piercing will get infected, you’ll have a hor-
rible series of hangovers, you’ll get stuck in
an elevator, you’ll get a paper out on your
tongue and everyone will blame you for that
honible stench in the bathroom.

Scorpio — Your social life is booming.
Throw parties, go to parties, talk your fool
head off in class — no matter what, you’ll
be adored. This is the month to ask people
out and to make new ﬁiends. Go ahead and
debut that sassy new outﬁt that you’re just
not sure about. Insist that leisure suits and
hot pants are coming back into style; every-
one will follow your lead, 0 Guru of Cool.

S_agLta__@ — According to the stars,
any recreational activities that involve
whipped cream in an aerosol can, tinker
toys, scotch tape, pushpins and small wood-
land creatures are bound to end in severe
pain or discomfort for you. There’s also a
strong possibility that you will be caught in
the act and have your face plastered across
the front page of The Pitt News with a
derogatory, mocking headline. Just a warn-
mg.

Capricom — This is your month to
shine! Enter a talent competition as Gumby,
and get a ﬁiend to dress up as Pokey, and
you’re virtually guaranteed to win (by my

standards, anyway). Audition as the
replacement Spice Girl, and you’ll get the
job (though it remains to be seen if that’s
good or bad). Whatever musical or theatri-
cal talents you may have will come out and
rear their little artistic heads. It’s best to
yield to them  nothing worse than dis-
gruntled talents.

Aguarius + That hottie in your class
you were planning on asking out? Forget it
 it’ll only come to pain and suffering on
your part. Instead, get a hobby. Watching
paint dry is a lot more fascinating than peo-
ple think. Or, you could try to beat
PeeWee’s giant aluminum foil ball.
Conduct a study that compares the numbers
of blondes to the numbers of brunettes on
campus, then try to ﬁnd somebody who will
publish the results.

Pisces — Stay clear of convenience
stores, electrical sockets, and tropical.jun—
gles. You’ll either be implicated in a rob-
bery, electrocuted, or infected by some hor-
rible tropical disease that you will bring
back with you and that will eventually
cause the downfall of civilization. Only the
pygrrries and the cockroaches will survive,
and boy, what a sorry" world THAT would
be! . .

Andrea Woessner is trying to see just how
long she can remain sleepless and yet still
retain her sanity  so far, its not working
too well.

Forum coverage
irresponsible
and unfair

“At the University of Pittsburgh, black

students are not held back.” This is the open-
ing statement about Pitt found in the book

‘The Black Student’s Guide to Colleges.”
The validity of this statement is called into
question when Aﬁican American students

striving to go forward and improve this uni-

versity for all are held back by blatantly
unfair and discriminatory practices.

The Pitt News published an article that
reported on the Meet the Candidates forum
held Nov. 11. The article brutally fails to
report on the event with fairness and equali-
_ty, as board candidates Safula Lewis and

;Markques McKnight were not even‘men—
,tioned in the article, only named in the cap-
_tion of a photograph. None of their ideas,‘
goals or plans were written. about, as if their I
campaign for Student Government Board is

a non-factor. Furthermore, The Pitt News
failed to cover board candidate Gerald
Bergen at all,'who was not ‘pictured or men-
tioned in the news article. Why were these

candidates singled. out and orrritted from’

coverage of the forum?

. Shavon Ogunleye, presidential candi- —
date, was paraphrased‘ rather than directly -

quoted, and the wording drastically distorts
her arguments. .

“She said she would favor the installa-
tion of campus emergency telephones with
blue lights on them but that Pitt carmot do
that because South Oakland is the city’s
jurisdiction.” Collapsing OgurIleye’s state-
ments and ideas into a mere sentence does
not convey her complete stance on the issue
and creates a situation in which fair report-
ing for all candidates is called into question.

Ogunleye stated she would explore the
possibility of working out jurisdictional mat-
ters between Pitt and the city of Pittsburgh,
and would be willing to work with both..the
university I and city ofﬁcials in eﬁbrts to
improve safetyin South Oakland. Stating

Pitt football fans are begging for a
reason to smile.

First, the Panthers lost by eight
points (to another conference opponent
with a sub-.500 record. Then, the
Steelers lost to a‘ conference opponent
that used its immense payroll to pur-
chase one of those little‘ intangibles that
the blac-k-and-gold can’t afford —— a
kicker. _

And all those papers that are due
before Thanksgiving have moved slow-
ly from the “to-do” list to the “do-now-
or-don’t-pass” list.

So put the papers down for another
few hours and slip into 1999, when the
papers will ﬁnish themselves, Norm
Johnson‘ will be healthy, and people
will start to plan their millennium par-
ties in rnid-August.

Oh, and it will be when Pitt goes
back to a bowl game.

After ‘Saturday’s loss, Walt Harris
came up with the best explanation for a
2-7. season that anyone’s ever given:
“They just haven’t learned to do it yet.”

He referred to his young players,
who should be backing up juniors and
seniors this season instead of playing
against Division I opposition.

By next season, they’ll all know
what "to expect.

A quick glance at the top tacklers
from Saturday’s game shows ' one
senior among the ﬁrst 12 names. Junior
Seth Hornack and freshman Ryan
Gonsales — ‘who started his first game
in the 23-15 loss —. each registered
nine tackles, tying senior Tray Crayton
for the team lead.

' Junior Hank Poteat padded his
interception stats. Junior Trey McCray
and freshman Joe Conlin each regis-

tered a sack. Freshman Nick Cole_

recorded a fumble recovery, a pass
breakup and four tackles.

This year’s nationally ranked
defense will come back in 1999 with
seven starters. Gonsales and experi-
enced junior Ken Kashubara will ﬁll in
for Phil Clarke, speedster Chiffon Allen
_will fill in for Crayton, 285-pound
monster sophomore Mike White will
take over for Kenny Pegram, and

’ McCray will step in for Marlin Young.

Julian Graham and D.J. Dinkins
will become defensive leaders,
Demond Gibson will clog the middle,
and Poteat will get his picture on a
cereal box.

But wait —-— there’s more.

 

Tursnmr, 17 Novmman 1998

 
 

Harris wants to win, not give up on season

David Turner

Staff Writer

“With all chances for a bowl game lost,
the 1998 Pitt football season is officially
over.

Or is it?

“I don’t believe in building for the
future,” Walt Harris said at his weekly press
conference Monday. “Once we’re in the
season, we’re trying to do everything we
can to have as good a football team as we
can.”

“One win would be huge,” he added.
“Believe me.”

Harris and his troops will take that atti-
tude to their meeting with the University of
Miami Hurricanes Thursday night. Game
time is scheduled for 8 p.m. I

To the Panthers’ advantage, strong
memories still exist from last year’s emo-
tional Homecoming game, in which Pitt
upset 21-17.

‘‘I would hope it has some bearing,”
Harris said. “I’m sure that’s going to add to
ﬂie excitement of the ball game.”

Going against the Panthers, however,
is the fact that they are not playing well and
lost their ﬁfth straight game Saturday
against Boston College.

Harris put blame for the losing streak
on inexperience, claiming  young play-
ers who would be red-shirted in other pro-
grams’ are being forced on the ﬁeld too

early at Pitt.

“Ithinktl1e prob-
lem is that a lot of
them are playing
before they’ve paid
their dues,” Harris
said.

Additionally, the
Panthers might be
without their third
leading tackler and
defensive leader, Phil
Clarke, who has a
groin injury, and
without the Big
East’s second-lead-
ing receiver, Latef
Grim, who is suﬁer-
ing from the effects
of a concussion.

' While Harris
will not sacriﬁce this
season for the future
of the program, he is
willing to look forward to the $20 million
proposed sports,-medicine facility, a joint
venture with the Steelers.

“We’ll have a football facility that is, I
think, second to none in the United States,”
Harris said “We feel strongly that that
would give us some more advantages [in

to represent the needs and concerns of the stu-

_ dents of the University of Pittsburgh as President

of the Student Government Board.

Reasons for running: .
Anytime someone chooses to run in an election
for a public office in government, that person has
chosen to take on a major responsibility. The '
responsibility chosen is the desire to represent and
to remain committed to fulfilling the needs and
concerns of the electorate. My reason for running
in this SGB Presidential Election is to serve the stu-
dents. This is who I am and what I stand for as a
student at the University of Pittsburgh. Service to
the students is what I have done for the past four
years as an involved member of SGB and as a
Resident Assistant for this year and last. The office
of President of the Student Government Board is
the highest position of service that a student on
this campus can strive to attain. I run in this elec-
tion not for my own self interests, but for the inter-
ests of the student for whom I have dedicated
myself to represent and serve.

Reasons for running:

I am running for SGB President because I have the .

experience, commitment and vision to accomplish
the goals that will improve your lives at Pitt.

As Chair of the Academic Affairs
Committee, I launched The Bookswap Program, I
organized and directed the first Student Evaluation
of Advisors, and I initiated a series of workshops
with student leaders concerning academic issues.
My involvement with student government, organi-
zations, and honor societies during the past three
years has enabled me to effectively work with stu-
dents and University administrators.

My commitment to the University of
Pittsburgh and its students is unchallenged. Last
year, I ran for SGB and didn't make it. While
some could have become discouraged, I was not.
In fact, my commitment has increased. Through
hard work and dedication, I was able to achieve
every one of my campaign goals.

My vision provides real solutions to real
problems to priority issues, like communication,
services and academics. I am a proven student
leader and I am running to continue to be your
voice of the student body as your SGB President.

Paid for by your
Student Activity Fee

Goals if elected:

My goals if elected represent the two functions of
the Student Government Board. The first function
is the allocating of the Student Activities Fee. I

- propose and pledge to make the Allocations

-process more friendly for both students and orga-
nizations. I want to work directly with student
groups to ensure that they receive funding for the
most necessary and vital components of their
organizations. I want to make the Allocations
process more equitable for the students. The sec-
ond function of SGB and goal of mine is adequate
representation of student needs on this campus.
The Student Government Board was created to
represent the needs of the undergraduate students;
now is the time for the students to direct the insti-
tution that was created for them. I want more stu-
dent input into the work of SGB. I pledge to
send representatives of SGB to the farthest corners
of campus in order to know what the students
want from their elected officials. And I pledge to
follow through on those student needs. This
vision of mine is a way of putting Student
Government back in the hands of the students.

Goals if elected:
I will increase communication on campus. I will

bridge the gap between students and their govem-

ment. I will inaugurate a newsletter from SGB to
the students we serve. You will be kept aware of
important infomaation and we will be held "
accountable for our actions.

‘ I will work to expand and improve ser-

vices provided by the University. I have been able ’

to work eliectively with admiriistrators in the past
and I will continue to ﬁght to extend the hours of
dining halls, labs and libraries and improve the
quality of food, housing and transportation.

I will lobby the administration to enrich
the quality" of education at Pitt. That’s why we're

here, to study, to learn, and to earn a degree. And

I will work to improve registration, advising, test-
ing, grades, books, class size and cum'culum..

My chief goal if elected is to serve the
students at the University of Pittsburgh honestly
and effectively, always placing your concerns at
the center of every day of my year of service.

Reasons for running:

There are several reasons why I have chosen to
run for Student Government Board President, but
the main reason-is because I think IT IS ABOUT

THAT T.I.M.E. (Taking time to Investigate Mobilize
and Empower). A TIME FOR CHANGE, A TIME
FOR STUDENTS, A TIME FOR ACTION. It is time
for SGB to become more culturally diverse, so that
we can fully represent all students here at the
University of Pittsburgh. It is time for new ideas
and visions from students on the outside looking
in. The SGB office needs to be extended outside
of room 639 in the WPU and out to the student
body. It is time for SGB to put the power and deci-
sions back into the Student’s hands therefore,
allowing the wants and needs of the students to
be addressed. In my opinion, there is a need for
ACTION through, and the TIME is NOW.

Goals if elected: .

If elected I would like to see the following issues
addressed: 1. Adequate Student Representation
SGB, 2. Safety issues extended to off campus (i.e.
South Oakland), 3. Reevaluation of the Admissions
process, 4. Feasibility of a twenty-four hour
Library, 5. Adequate housing for all STUDENTS, 6.
Reevaluation of the Muticultural Committee, 7. A
Campaign here at the University for Loan—free
financial aid, and 8. Continuance of conferences,

programs, etc., which promote access to higher
education. «

Reasons for running:

Earlier this semester, I was evicted from my apart-
ment. My brother and Iwere quite frankly
yanked around by a landlord who seemed to
have no real respect for his tenants in general.
After having heard other stories about students
that were being mistreated by their landlords
(who were taking advantage of students isolation
from their families, their poverty, and their gener-
al ignorance of -the law), it made me wonder
what assistance the University could offer, if any.
And while they do offer free legal help, we had
no idea it was available until after we had.
entered our appeal.

With the restrictions on housing that
upperclassmenihave, chances are students will
eventually move off campus, and try his or her
luck with the local Oakland/Squirrel ,
Hill/Shadyside landlords, and run the chance of
being taken advantage of. so regardless of
whether people live on campus or off, abysmal
lessors will affect most students directly or indi-
rectly.

It seems rather strange even to me that
this one event would spur me on to try and take
an SGB seat, but when you've been wronged,
you will do everything possible to make things
right. And that is my intention.

'Goalslfelected: '

-To better advertise the school's legal
assistance program. _

-A clearinghouse where students can
enter complaints about landlords, and turn these
complaints into source material for students look-
ing to rent. For exatnple, if the landlord has a.
record of not paying hot water bills and having
the services shut off, chances are the landlord
wouldnotbeagoodpartnertodobusinesswith
in the future.

-To address commuter and off-campus
concerns like the availability of extra shuttles dur-
ing weekends and peak hours, and the possibility
of service into Squirrel Hill.

-A smoking lounge indoors during the
cold winter months. ,

Qualiﬁcations:

Being on the Student Government Board is a
serious endeavor. Anyone who attempts to take
on this responsibility needs to have a strong
desire and a passion for this university to suc-
ceed. Through various involvements on campus,
I feel that I have gained the experience needed
to be a productive representative of the student
body.‘ My qualifications include serving as an
active member of the Pitt Pathfinders, and my
sorority, Kappa Kappa Gamma, where I was
elected to the positions of pledge class president
and, currently, Vice President of Standards. I
have also held leadership positions in
A.F.R.O.T.C. including Operations Support Flight
Commander, Wing Executive Officer and
Fundraising Flight Commander. Having proven
myself a dedicated leader in R.O.T.C, I graduated
second in my’ ﬂight from Field Training and
received the honor of Distinguished Graduate. I
also recognize the importance of community ser-
vice, and have participated in events including
Special Olympics and Freshman Arrival Survival.
Through my different organizations, I feel I have
a clear understanding of the student body of Pitt.

Reasons for running: ‘

I am running for Student Government because I
feel that I can make a difference in the Pitt com-
munity. I am prepared to put in the time and
effort to make the Student Government Board an
effective representation of the student body. I
would like to emphasize diversity and unity

‘among students. It is my goal to add a sense of

diligence and integrity to the board.

Goals if elected:

We need to get students involved on campus in
order to create a more aware," more productive
student body. I would like to have a spring activi-
ties fair to increase awareness for students to get
involved in campus activities. For freshman, the
fall semester can be overwhelming and students
may not know which organizations to choose so
early in the year. Not only can Pitt be overwhelm-
ing for freshman, but transfer students are not
immune to the difficulty of adjusting to the Pitt
atmosphere. This year the Chancellor’s report
indicated an increase in transfer applications by
more than forty percent. I would like to give
transfer students the opportunity to attend ATR
(Advising Testing and Registration) sessions
specifically for transfer students and to give them

Reasons for running: .

I decided to stop complaining, inherently criticiz-

My initial goal is to establish long-termed activi-
ties geared towards ALL students, thus establish-
ing PI'I'I‘ PRIDE, which is severely lacking on this
campus. Concerts and Pitt Pride recognition days
entitled to appreciating the students should be in
existence. Pittsburgh has more entertaining facili-

ties and resources that should be accredited to the ,

use of the students at this university, that are cur-

rently not available. Overall, great communication .

between the organizations and SGB lacks true
accomplishments and results geared towards the
needs of the students. I'm striving towards com-
plete satisfaction with our university, acadernical—
ly, financially, and definitely socially. It's mostly
about Progress & Pride. '

instrumental in the decision-rnaking process for
student affairs. Therefore I already have a stand-
ing, working relationship with those same admin-
istrators who irnpart policy on the student body.

Reasons for running:

I As an already established student leader on cam-

pus, I have always felt that a student leader
should be active in knowing about the students
he/she represents, active in the concerns of stu- ‘
dents, and active for the well-being of the stu-
dents. I commend the current SGB for their
efforts, although I don't believe that enough stu-
dent leaders possess these necessary qualities. I
represent all of my organizations and endorsers
as a student leader who has these qualities. In
turn, I see a need for more student leaders who
know or are trying to know the students. I see a
need for ‘student leaders who can identify with
and are active in the concerns for the students, as
well as our well-being. Therefore, as an already
established student leader, I feel that I can ade-
quately ﬁll the empty space that I see in student
leadership.

Goals if elected:

The issues that Shavon and myself are running
for are those goals we plan to attain. They are: 1.
Student Representation-First, and most important-
ly as SGB member, I would like for'SGB as an
organization to get re-acquainted with the stu-
dent body, to truly be a voice for the student
body, and to not be limited to the ofﬁce. A sug-
gestion would be to have members ofthe board

‘periodically have stations throughout campus to

inquire and address issues proposed directly by

Current Rainbow Alliance Co-President

United States Student Association Board member
Active member of UPSA Committee of SGB

Reasons for running:
The University of Pittsburgh is experiencing a
tremendous amount of growth and change as we
strive to become a public ivy. We have begun
the process of admitting fewer freshmen, we
have cut the STEP program and made it harder to
earn an A in the English department all in the
past year. V

,_ As an interested and active member of
the Pitt community I think it is important that we"
as students unite and begin to decide what we
want Pitt to be. Are we in favor of Pitt's decision
to become a public ivy as it means that our
degrees will be worth more? Or should we be
concerned because it is possible that the level of
diversity this University has may be gone forever
if we do not take action now.

I would like to become a Student
Government Board member because I am a per-
son of action. I think it is time for SGB to stop
waiting for students to come to them. It is time
for SGB to ask students what they want and then
do it. Most importantly, Nikki and I represent all
of the people on this campus who have never
felt like SGB has represented them.

Goals if elected: .

If elected, I want to work on making sure that
SGB represents the interests of all students on
this campus. I can promise to get better meal
plans, heat in the Towers and more off-campus
security but I know that there is only so much
thatonepersoncando.’ Ifthereisnostudent
support and willingness to change these major
problems, nothing will ever change.

Iheonlywaywecanaffectcharrgeon
this campus is if students come together and ‘
work to solve problems collectively. Therefore,
my goal, if elected, is to make Student
Government Board members approachable peo-
ple who help Pitt students solve problems for
themselves.

Qualiﬁcations:

1 semester Government Relations Committee

1 semesters Judicial Affairs Committee (resigned
to run for Board), during which we revised all of
the standing committee by-laws (some of which
had not been revised since the 1970s) and
Student Government Board by-laws.

2 years experience in a professional office.

Reasons for Running:

I am running for Board for a few reasons. First,- I
have experience working on SGB committees
and in a professional office, and would like to
use the experience for the good of the students.
Second, student government is something I
enjoy. While some people enjoy their sports and
other people enjoy their parties, I enjoy student
government. It's what I've been involved in that
I really like.

Goals if elected:

First, and foremost, I would like to be a voice for
the students, an open door where students could
come with concerns, problems, questions, etc.
and receive answers and results. I believe that is
one of the biggest parts of what student govem-
ment should be. Secondly, I would like to con-
tinue the effort to bring better food service to this
campus. We pay the university for our blocks,
they are not given to us, and when someone
decides that they can take away what is ours at
the end of every week, that's not right. We need
the blocks per semester plan back. We also need
some variety in the meals we get; having the
same food over and over is a little nauseating.
Thirdly, I would like to continue the newly creat-
ed alcohol awareness ad-hoc committee of SGB,
and expand it into a larger alcohol awareness
program for allincoming freshmen possibly a
program for during orientation. Lastly, I would
like to work with the other elected board mem-
bers and president to continue the level of ‘excel- V
lence maintained by this year's board and presi-
dent.

Reasons for Running:

In the past the Student Government Board has

am confident that I can work with the under- rep-
resented groups on this campus so that they have
a voice; but also because I hope that my cam-
paign will help to encourage other people who
might not normally run for SGB, to run and pro-
cure seats in the future.

I am also running for SGB because I
am an approachable, capable person and I feel '
that we can work together to further the strides
that the past SGB has made to better the quality
of life for Pitt students. As the current President
of the Campus Women's Organization, I come
from a strong grassroots background; and as a
leader, I know how to demand that issues that
are fundamental to our everyday lives are
addressed. I believe that we can work together to
EVOLVE, change, and redirect the energy of the

Student Government Board to meet the needs of . ,

everyone. '

Goals if elected: .

My goal is to infuse some new ideas into the
same old SGB. I will help to create a friendlier
and more inclusive SGB by getting Pitt students
the information that they need to be informed
about the Student Government Board itself, and
information about the many resources available
to them. I want to see SGB become more of a
“watchdog,” and, if elected, I will fight to ensure
that Pitt students are not getting slighted. If I am
elected as a member of SGB, I,will also join’ in ,
the ﬁght to reform food services and better inade-
quate Pitt facilities. Finally, I will work diligently
to provide all of us with a cleaner, safer, and
more hospitable environment.

As a student at the University of Pittsburgh, I felt
inclined to join an organization that would allow
me to voice my opinion on positive changes that
could be made to benefit the student body at the
University of Pittsburgh. I view the Student
Government Board as an ideal position to share
my suggestions (and if necessary vent my frustra-
tions) with my fellow peers. I feel that I have
developed the dedication and commitment ‘’
throughout my college career to become a
responsible member of the Student Government
Board. ’

Goals if elected:

Student Government Board members are under
the constant scrutiny and criticism of the 14,000
undergraduates, and the numerous student orga-
nizations on this campus. I feel that one way that
we can channel these constructive cn'ticisms is by
the introduction‘ of complaint boxes in the major

‘ dormitories on campus and in the Student Union.

This would give the student body an opportunity
to voice their opinions on the positive changes
that might benefit the entire University. We must
strive to eliminate the feeling of alienation that
some students feel towards the University. There
are students that say, “I'm just one student, who
is going to take my complaint seriously? The
complaint boxes will eliminate these feelings of
alienation and extend the opportunity for all
14,000 undergraduates to voice their opinions.
These complaints would be gathered and

‘ reviewed by the Student Government Board.

This measure would give the student body a
chance to work side by side with the Student
Government Board. Hail To Pitt!

Pitt student Eisminger to compete
in Fitness America competition

Rehan Nasir
[Staff Wrlter

Heather Eisiminger wants peo-
ple to know Fitness America is not
about bodybuilding.

Eisiminger will compete at the
national level for Fitness America,
in Rodardo Beach, Calif., this

' Friday. The competition, broadcast

on ESPN, showcases the top-50 fin-
ishers from regional competitions.

_ Eisiminger placed third in a New

Jersey event. The top-five finishers
from each contest go to nationals.
But the competition is ‘not about
huge muscles and Arnold
Schwarzenegger-like proportions.
“The event has‘ essentially two
components — the swimsuit and the
fitness routine. For the swimsuit,
you’re basically showing off that
you have a well-toned body. You
aren’t there to show off your huge
muscles. With the routine, you
showcase your strength — doing
mostly gymnastics moves, strange
splits and weird push-ups,”

' Eisiminger said. _

Although Eisiminger is relative-
ly new to the sport —— and young, at
only 24 —— she has been doing gym-
nastics since she was 10. Last year,
she worked in Greentree with the
Keystone Oaks High School’s gym-
nastics fitness show team.

“I had to choreograph their rou-

tines, and so I had to be able to do
some ‘of the moves myself,” she
said. “That’s basically how it start-
ed. The kids and I traveled to vari-
ous body building and fitness
shows. Being a gymnast helps —
many of the moves require the

strength and finesse that gymnasts
already have.”

Eisiminger exercises six times a
week. Before the competition starts
this weekend, she will take part in
an obstacle course against other
competitors.

“It’s an Army obstacle course,
and really, I don’t think I’ll do all
that well,” she joked.

If Eisiminger should place in
the top 30 at the national level,
she’ll be invited to compete interna-
tionally. That event is held in early
December in Orlando, Fla.

The first place finisher receives
$25,000, a Corvette, a trip to
Hawaii and a major modeling con-
tract.

“A great part about the event in
California is that all the major fit-
ness magazines are there, as well as
entertainment and sports shows. If
anything, it would be really great to
walk away with a contract, model-
ing for a magazine or with one of
the nutritional supplement
providers,” she said.

The national event is a natural
one, meaning that the participants
are tested for drugs. Eisiminger said
she only uses protein drinks.

This is only Eisiminger’-s first
year competing._ She is a graduate
student in Pitt’s School of Social
Work. -

This sometimes creates a prob-
lem. .
“Being a student and having two
jobs, it’s very hard to keep up with
the strict regiment that many of the
top contestants have,” she said.
“That’s what probably will separate
me from the top competitors.”

Weightlifting club pumping iron

Rehan Nasir

Staff Writer

Past the Cathedral, beyond
Heinz Chapel and in Bellefield
Hall, Pitt students are picking up.

Really heavy things. V '-

Pitt’s club sports have gaine
another member, this time, a
weightlifting club.

The club is less than a month
old and has already had a competi-
tion.

“Last week, we had an interclub
meet,” said Bryan Chaikin, the
club’s vice president. “Everyone
had a great time. We have 12 mem-
bers so far, most of whom are fresh-
man, and.. sophomores.”

In addition to lifting, Chaikin

and senior president Dan Soliman-

demonstrated various workout tech-

-niques.

For the event, the club followed
the scoring rules established by the
International Powerlifting
Federation.

“With powerlifting, you focus
more on the technique and perfect-
ing it than with the amount of
weight,” Chaikin said. ‘

“But for the weight, we did use‘

the Wilkes formula, which takes
into account how much you weigh
and how much you can lift. Since
we didn’t have a large number in
each weight class, we thought this
to be the best way to do it.”

The club’s main goal is for peo-
ple seriously interested in power-

lifting, Olympic lifting and body-‘

building to get together and work-
out.

The club’s coach and advisor,
George Panzak, has been an active
lifter for 30 years. He helps the

group with training and motivates
them as they sculpt their bodies.

“The freshmen in the club are
working on building themselves up
and becoming more competitive.
Right now, they’re having fun.”
said Chaikin.

For most, lifting is a hobby,
although it is possible to make a
living out of the sport, but it is not
an easy task.

Powerlifting is not yet an
Olympic sport, as is Olympic lift-
1ng. .
The differences lay in‘ the
method and requirements for the
lift. ‘

Soliman, who has been power-
lifting since he was a junior in high
school, has been the three-time
junior national champion. ‘

“When I was a freshman in high
school, after the football season, I
became interested in lifting. I think
that for most people, they can get
involved during their sports’ off-
season.” '

Soliman was champion during
his junior and senior years. Last
year, he competed again.

The sophomore can squat 640
pounds and bench press nearly 400
pounds Recognized once as the
“Strongest in the country under 200
pounds,” Soliman hopes to compete
in the Junior World Championships
soon. _

The clubworks out nearly every
day of the week in Bellefield Hall,
where the members have been
receiving equipment from various
sources. 5

“With the training, it’s more
about feeling the reactions from
your body — it’s more of a holistic
approach,” Chaikin said.

Despite losses by both the men’s and women’s
swimming and diving teams this Saturday, ﬂiere were
individual bright spots. .

Competing in a dual meet versus the University of
Virginia, the men lost 131.5-111.5, and the women 133-
104. .

The men dropped to 2-4 and the women to 3-3.

“Virginia is a very strong team,” said Marian
Cassidy—Keen, the ' women’s head coach. “Swimming
isn’t like basketball, or some other sports where you can
get hot one night and knock someone off. We did as well
as we expected to do. We had some season best times.”

Samantha Chabotar, a ‘senior swimmer, dominated
in her events. In both the 500- and 1000-yard freestyle,
she ﬁnished ﬁrst, ‘winning the 1000 freestyle by more
than 11 seconds. She also won the 400-yard individual
medley. Chabotar came close to her season-best scores
in this event for all three swims.

posted a season-best time of 2:06.02. Jamie Tomazich,
a junior diver, won both the 1- and 3- meter diving

' event. In the 1-meter, she won convincingly by more

than 30 points.

The group of Dianna Prangley, Megan Zerhusen,
Amanda Lyle and Melinda Koser ﬁnished ﬁrst in the
400-yard freestyle. They beat out the three other four-
somes entered by UVA.

Zerhusen had a season best in the 50-yard freestyle,
with a time of 24.62. Melissa Kosinski posted her fastest
time of the season as well, in the 200-yard breastioke
with 2:28.54. .

The men also had strong swims, but inthe end, they
came up short. , .

“The meet was quite a bit closer than the score
shows,” said men’s head coach Chuck Knoles. “Our
men were competitive in all but the distance events.”

Glenn Zook
Staff Wrlter

The women’s volleyball team
closed out its season by splitting
home games against Notre Dame
and Syracuse over the weekend.

‘The Panthers lost a close one to
Notre Dame Saturday, with the Irish
winning the last game 21-19 to take
the match. » ' z -

Melissa Alpers led the team
with 17 kills, and Paula Zemrowski
added another 16.

Alpers also led the defense with
16 digs, while Tara Haefner and
Marcia Thiesen helped with 15 and
14 digs, respectively.

The Panthers bounced back to
win their final match of the season
against Syracuse.

They took all three games in a
sweep of the Orangemen.

Theisen led the team with 11
kills, while , Jennifer Nickels
pitched in 8. Alpers and Theisen
both led the defense with 14 digs
each.

The Panthers close out their
regular season with an overall
record of 16-13 and a Big East

The trouncing of Robert Morris
matched Pitt against Miami of Ohio
in Sunday’s championship game.

The Panthers didn’t jump out to a
commanding lead the way they did

Miami led 37-34 at halftime.

Waites said of the Redhawks. “They
were a very fundamentally sound,
very good defensive team.”

Waites explained that the team

third with 13 points and 10 boards.

Morris and Robert Morris for-

Waites explained that the win
doesn’t change the Panthers’ goals
for this season. She says they want to
be a solid, disciplined team that
plays everyone tough and isn’t a
pushover opponent for anyone.

“This win is definitely going to
be a big help to the team’s confi-
dence,” Waites said. “But those two
teams were warm-up teams. We’ve
got to get better every game. I want
us to be more aggressive from the

100-yard freestyle and Pron placed ﬁrst in
the 400-yard ﬁeestyle. Along with Miah
Heath, Patrick Shedlock and Brian Elko, the
men placed ﬁrst in the 400 freestyle.

7‘We knew coming into this meet that
we would have a tough ﬁght on our hands,”
Knoles said “We had just ﬁnished a tough
week of training, and it was predictable that
we would not be at_our best for the compe-
tition.”

Continuing the sweep of diving,
Michael Wells placed ﬁrst in the 1 meter,
and George Anderson, a senior co—captain,
ﬁrst in the 3 meter. Only a freshman, Blair

and Anderson.

Knoles explained that swimming is a
sport in which a swimmer can only have his

fastest swims a couple times a year because A

of the continuous training involved

“It’s not that we don’t care about our
dual meets  but we decided early on to
train right through our ﬁrst semester meets
in order to get the most out of our training
time,” Knoles continued. “We decided to
rest only for the Indiana Invitational this
semester.”

That means the plan is for the team to
—hopefully — swim its fastest times at the
Indiana Invitational and the end-of-the-sea-
son Big East championships.

The weekend of Nov. 20-22 will have
the men competing in the Indiana
Invitational in Bloomington, and the
women will travel to the Minnesota
Invitational.
