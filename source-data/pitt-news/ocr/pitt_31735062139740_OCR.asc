"University In Dark As Time
For Investigation Nears,
Turner Not Called

Republican Appointed

BULLETIN

Wilson Gillette, Towanda Repub-
lican, was appointed by Speaker
Sarig to fill the vacancy as the Pitt
News went to press late yesterday.
He has not accepted officially as
yet.

 

The legislature's probe of the
University reached a static point
yesterday.

House Speaker ‘Wilson G. Sarig
-—-who two days ago was to ap-
point a ﬁfth member on the com-

mittee to ﬁll a vacancy left by
the resignation of Jacob B. Schrock,
Somerset Republican—had yet to
make the appointment.

The investigation of “academic
freedom” here was to begin Friday.

Today, however, neither Chancellor
John G. Bowman nor Dr. Ralph E.
'Turner——history professor whose oust-
ing precipitated the probe—have as
yet been notiﬁed.

Dr. Turner in New York told The
News he would appear should he be
called. Eugene A. Caputo, chairman
of the committee, said he would be
called. So far no action has been
taken.

Mr. Caputo is expected to arrive
from Harrisburg tonight or tomorrow.
Whether he will call a hearing at that
time depends on whether the ﬁfth
committee member has been appoint-
ed.

The state legislature adjourns over
the week-end tomorrow. The other
three committee members who may
assemble in Pittsburgh are:

Frank J, Zappala and Homer S.
Brown, Pittsburgh, and James E.
Lovett, Trafford. .

The University——it was learned on
good author-ity—will be represented
>1-."ll‘.llel‘ by C. F. C. Arensberg or James
5. Crawford, attorneys, at any ses-
sions the committee may call.

The committee will have full powers
to subpena anyone necessary to the
investigation. Professors who wish
to meet the committee will have an
opportunity to do so.

It is expected, however, that since
tile hearing will be open, no “sensa-
tional” charges will be aired in pub-
=.ic—it' there are any to be aired.

Panhel Sponsors
Formal Banquet

235 Women Expected To Attend
Traditional Affair Tomorrow

Panhellenic Council has invited the
modern Greeks of the University to a
l—'-annellenic congress at the ancient
temple of Pallas Athene to discuss
the “Glory that was Greece.” The
Council is sponsoring a formal ban-
nueu for actives and pledges of social
:‘rat.ernities at Heinz House at 6
o'clock tomorrow evening.

About 235 women are expected to
attend this affair, an annual tradition
of Panhellenic. Tickets may be pur-
chased from any member of the
Council for 85 cents and the ticket
stubs, with the name of the purchaser
and her fraternity, should be handed
in at Heinz House today.

Eight women will tell of the contri-
butions of the sections of Greece to
the whole of Greek culture. Dr. Rich-
nrd L. Hope, associate professor of
philosophy, will be the main speaker
of the evening. His subject will be
“Greek ideals in the light of philosophy
 an avocation." Mrs. Jesse Walton,
president of City Panhellenic, will
present the scholarship cup to the fra-
ternity which maintained the highest
quality point average for the last two
;+en1estex'c

The University trio and two double
quartets will furnish music during the
dinner. The quartets will sing one
song from each fraternity.

hall.

Dr. Held will conduct the interviews
from Monda.y, April 1, to April 12,
during which time applications for

Goldberg’s summation included a re-

Petitions Ready
For CA Positions

Blanks, Requiring 25 Signatures,
Available In College Oﬁice

While Room 801, Cathedral, and the
University generally have been over-
run with aspiring politicians bearing
petitions for nomination to the Stu-
dent Faculty Association General As-
sembly, a new source of petition
signers will be tapped as College As-
sociation petitions are made availa-
ble tod:-1_V.

Nomination for oﬁices of president,
vice president, secretary, and treas-
urer of the organization will follow
the same procedure as that for nomi-

matic nomination.

The blanks are available in the of-
ﬁce of the College, Room 201, State

same ofﬁce.

SFA petitions, tinted azure blue,
were much sought after Monday, when
they were first made available in the
oﬂice of the dean of men, Room 801,
Cathedral, and their sponsors were in
turn seeking signatures indefatigably.

Leonard Marks, C35, chairman of
the Assembly, advised that any one
person may sign only six petitions.

Elterich Describes
Infants’ Diseases

Mortality Of_ Infectious Illnesses
I-Iigh, Claims Pediatrician

Addressing the psychology forum
Monday on “Modern trends in the care
of children,” Dr. Theodore O. Elterich_
assistant professor of pediatrics and
lecturer in psychology, outlined child-
hood diseases and explained the pre-
ventive methods which are being de-
veloped by leading pediatricians.

Convalescent serum, adult blood and
injections of immunating vaccines
were cited by Dr. Elterich as methods
which have been used to combat such
diseases as measles, whooping cough
and infantile paralysis.

Of the 3,000,000 cases of communi-
cable diseases reported every year,
he pointed out, over half are children's
cases. The seriousness of the infec-
tion decreases as the age of the child
increases. Ninety-six p-er cent of
deaths from whooping cough, accord-
ing to statistics, occur in cases in
which the child is under 5 years of
age.

Measles kills ﬁve or six thousand
children in the United States alone
every year. All of these deaths, how-
ever, are not statistically attributed"
to measles. They are often the result
of complications such as pneumonia.
which set in during convalescence
from measles.

Twenty-one per cent of children in-
fected with infantile paralysis die dur-
ing an acute attack of the disease.
Infantile paralysis is not, Dr, Elterich
pointed out, as rare 3. disease as it is
commonly supposed to be. Many
adults have become immune to the
disease as a result of mild attacks al-
though they are never aware of the
fact that they had the disease at all.

Although many prophylactic meas-
ures have been discovered, they have
not all been widely enough applied to
prove them 100 per cent effective.

(From The Columbia Spectator)

She was born

_4
an

.5

Mrs.
Brooklyn, will be ninety-nine Sunday.
March 24, 1836.

She has lived through four wars: the Mexican war,
the Civil war, the Spanish-American war, and the World
war.

She was nurtured in the age of Enlightenment, of
transcendentalism and democratic idealism. She reached
maturity in the Gilded Age, the age of greed and sav-
agery in business and corruption in public service, of
vigorous nationalism, of shattered ideals. She was get-
ting old when Theodore Roosevelt grabbed Panama and
“busted” the trusts and shouted about the Square Deal.
Woodrow Wilson deserted Princeton for the White
House, left the White House for Versailles, and came
home to die of a broken heart—while she lingered on.
Then came another period of reckless “normalcy,” of
skyrocketing proﬁts, of Teapot Dome, of Calvin Cool-
idge: “Prosperity President, Great American,” homely
philosopher. Then the crash, with people jumping out
of windows on VVall Street. Then Hoover's defeat,
over which she still grieves. Breadlines, the New Deal,
labor problems, rearmament in Europe, and other things
she cannot understand.

Mrs. Fraser, who is nearly ninety-nine, still reads

“The Herald Tribune” and the “serious magazines.” She
still wants to know what is going on. She fears for the
future. ' '
' We say to Mrs. Fraser: You are right in fearing for
the future. Accumulating inequalities, the anarchy of
Pollyanna politics, industrial waste, mishandling of new-
found sources of wealth, are impelling us rapidly toward
the end of the road. Another Dark Age may be in store
for us, like the Dark Age which is already shrouding
parts of Europe. Perhaps we may, by fundamentally
reshaping our course, save what we have gained and ad-
vance toward a new and more abundant life. It will not
be easily achieved, miraculously bestowed upon us.

VVe wonder if you see all this, Mrs. Fraser. Perhaps
it is better if you do not.

 

Letters To The Editor

Says Several Complain
Editor, The Pitt News:

Several professors in the University are complaining
of the policy and the tactics employed by The Pitt
News. I have no experience whatsoever in the newspa-
per ﬁeld, but I do believe that it should be the aim of a
newspaper to furnish accurate news to its readers. A
reporter of your staff recently interviewed various mem-
bers of the faculty, including Dr. Tyson oi’. the economics
department, in regard to the proposed basketball game
between Pitt and Louisiana State. Dr. Tyson asked that
his statement he published accurately and that absolute-
ly no_thi_ng be" changed." ’But~,~in-tentionally or» uninten-
tionally, some words were either changed or omitted,
thus altering the meaning and giving a wrong impres-
sion to the reader.

Vital economic subjects have been discussed by Dr.
Tyson and Dr. McKay in various parts of the city this
semester. Not once has The Pitt News reviewed these
talks, which certainly would be more interesting and of
greater value than some of the news items now appear-
ing there.

Sometime ago I wrote a letter to you, but it was
never published. Now, I am not seeking any publicity,
but I should like to get student opinion on such subjects.
Surely, if you are reserving space for letters from read-
ers, you are ready to receive both favorable and unfavor-
able criticism.

EMANUEL M. KLEE,‘ C35. “

Want Thorough Probe
Editor, The Pitt News:

The investigation of the University of Pittsburgh by
the State legislature will serve to make even more clear
the place of Pitt in community life. The strife of the
past n1o11ths over the University’s policy is surely not
without ground. The National Student League, a non-
partisan student organization interested in student prob-
lems, recommends that the investigating committee con-
duct a thorough and exhaustive study into the adminis-
tration’s motives and policy as regards liberalism at
the University.

It will be a fruitless waste of the taxpayers’ money if

hampered student and faculty testimony. The Univer-
sity must make full public guarantees that reprisals
will not be made against testifying students and faculty

That the University of Pittsburgh has not served _the
public interest, students especially would be the ﬁrst to
deny; but the University, because of a deliberate admin-_
istrative program, failed signally to fulﬁll all its poten-
tialities. A real and a lasting public service will be
rendered by the investigation if it releases the University
of Pittsburgh from its present narrow and short-sighted
policies. ‘

Editor, The Pitt News:
In your issue of February 20 (a reporter) inserted a

gratuitous and distorting phrase—-“but seriously speak-,

ing”—'—following a statement solicited from me, that as-
serted my belief that the Supreme Court of the United
States is immune from the inﬂuence of economic pres-
sure groups. I said:

“The Supreme Court, like Caesar’s wife, is above re-
proach.” Even the conservative members, two of whom
have had active political careers, vote their sincere
convictions. One of the common delusions of Com-
munists and other radicals is that the Supreme Court is
inﬂuenced and controlled in its economic views by in-
terest groups.

Schoolboy Trackmen Meet
In Indoor Relays Saturday

Seven High Schools Already Entered In Second Annual
Carnival Sponsored By University Track Heads
TQM

High school lads from the leading Western Pennsylvania insti-
tutions will strut their stuff next Saturday at the Panther track
house when the Second Annual Interscholastic Invitational indoor
relay meet is run off. This sporting event will also write ﬁnis to
another chapter of the-‘Pitt indoor track season.

Coach Carl Olson, Panther track coach, has received entries
from seven scholastic institutions who are planning to send strong

teams to the meet.
have the list complete by today.
limiting the ﬁeld to 12 schools.

Academy high school of Erie, last
year’s winner, will not make the
journey to‘ Pittsburgh this year to de-
fend its laurels, but Ramsey high, sec-
ond place holders, will have a strong
outﬁt in the ﬁeld. Along with the
Ramsey will be Connellsville, Bridge-
ville, Clairton, Sharon, Canonsburg.
and East Huntingdon. The rest of
the team list will be ﬁlled by city
high school outﬁts. They will proba-
bly be South Hills, Schenley, Peabody,
Langley, and VVestinghouse. The light
for Academy high's title will probably
be a triangular battle between Ram-
sey, East Huntingdon, and Canons-
burg.

In Charley Poole, Canonsburg will
present a real threat for sprint honors.
Poole will be among the favorites to
take the 50-yard da.sh and perhaps to
set a new mark for that distance. At
present the record is held by Dick
Mason, former Oliver High sprint star,
who is now cavorting for Coach
Olson on the Pitt freshman squad.
Mason ran the 50 in 5.6 seconds at
last year's meet. ‘

Connellsville, dark horse for the
coming meet, has a ﬂashy middle—dis-
tance runner in VVoodruff, who will
hold down the anchor post on the
Fayette school-‘s relay team.

Pole-Vault Mark Should Go

Another mark due to be broken is
the pole-vault record. Bob Thomas,
Sharon entry, will be the marked man
in this event. Thomas is a consistent
12-footpperformer, and with the pres-
ent mark standing at only 9 feet, 10
inches, it shouldn't be too much to
expect to see this mark excelled.

Events on the program will include
the 50-yard dash, pole-vault, high
jump, 50-yard high hurdles, 50-yard
low hurdles, running broad jump, 12-
pound shot, distance medley, 8-lap,
medley, and 12-lap relays. In the dis-
tance medley, the .ﬁrst man will do 12
laps, the second and third men 5 laps
each, and the anchor runner will re-
peat the starter’s distance.

The meet will get under way at 11
o'clock Saturday morning with trial
heats in the 50-yard dash. Pitt track-
men will help out with the officiating.

After this track event is completed,
Olson will start preparations for the
outdoor season which will open April
13 with the annual University handi-
caps. Vvorkmen expect to have the
stadium track in ﬁrst class shape by
the end of next week.

Freshman Trackers

A chance for freshman trackmen
to show their stuff to Carl Olson, var-
sity track coach, comes with the an-
nouncement of the University’s an-

28. All freshmen interested should re-
port to the Track House on the after-
noon scheduled at 3:30.

Panther Runners
Hit Midwest Snag

Relayers Get Only Fourth Place
In Butler Indoor Carnival

The third trip of the Panther track
team into the midwest didn’t fare so
well for the Pittites as the two pre-
vious ones. Consequently, the track
team came back to Pittsburgh Sun-
day from the annual Butler indoor
relays with a, sixth place in team
standing in the track carnival held
Saturday afternoon and evening at
Indian‘.-lpolis. -

Michigans Big '.l‘en ‘champs copped
ﬁrst honors with 341/; points, nosing
out the Ohio State team which took
second place with 381,{, markers.
Notre Dame ﬁnished third followed
by Indiana, Drake and Pittsburgh.
The Panther boys scored 71/2 points,
combining a second in the low hurdles,
a tie for-fourth place in the pole-vault,
and fourth in the mile and four-mile
relay events for their -total.

Coach O=lson’s mile-relayers had a
bit of tough luck in stick-handling
and had to be content with a fourth
in that event. Michigan's baton-pass-
ers won the event in‘ the slow time of
3 -minutes, 26.5 seconds with Drake
and Notre Dame teams in second and
third positions, respectively. It was
the poorest showing the .mile-relay
team has made all season. The same
combination of Kiger, Groat, McDon-
ald, and Connelly which broke records
in the CIC and Armour Tech games
made up the Pitt entry.

Arvel Fleming continued his bril-
liant worl; in track competition, tak-
ing second in the 60-yard low hurdles.
Jesse Owens, ﬂashy runner from Ohio
State, beat the Panther runner to the
tape by just a few inches. His time
was 6.8 seconds. . '

Another point was added to the
Panther total by Cy Pelucha, who tied
with Edwards of Notre Dame for
fourth place in the pole vault. The
winner, Seeley of Illinois, set a. new
meet record, jumping 13 feet, 6%
inches

The four-mile relay team of Kirk-
patrick, 'I‘ost, Musico, and Wagen-
houser gave Pitt its ﬁnal score by
taking a fourth. Michigan’s crack
milers took ﬁrst, setting up a new
mark of 1.8 minutes, 2.5 seconds.
Kansas State and Ohio State held
second and third positions.

Pitt Boxer Wins
Conference Title

Giannatti Forced To Go Extra
Round To Defeat Conti

Captain Jimmy Ciannatti today
rules as the lightweight king of East-
ern Boxing Conference Fistiana.

The Pitt captain brought to a suc-
cessful close a three-year boxing cam-
paign when he defeated Conte of
VVashington and Jefferson in the ﬁnals
of the Eastern Intercollegiate boxing
tournament Saturday night at Mor-
gantown for the 135-pound title.

The VVest Virginia mittmen won ﬁve
out of the seven individual champion-
ships, while Pitt and Carnegie Tech
divided the remaining honors.

The 135-pound ﬁnal bout was the
feature attraction of the tournament.
After three rounds of give and take
ﬁghting. the officials decided that the
honors were even between Giannatti
and Conte. In accordance with tourna-
ment rules, an extra round was held
to decide the winner of the bout a.nd
the Panther representative was awardx
ed the decision,

Giannatti scored a technical knock-
out over Vacheresse of West Virginia
in the second round of their bout to
advance to the ﬁnals. The victory
was particularly sweet for the Pitt
leather-pusher as it enabled him to
avenge his only defeat, which he had
previously suffered at the hands of the
Mountaineer lightweight.

Bernie Speigel was the only other
member of the Panther delegation to
reach the ﬁnals. He encountered
Ferrari of \Vest Virginia in the ﬁnals
in the 145-pound class. Speigel ‘was
previously (lefeatedl by Ferra.r‘i‘ in» the
Pitt-Vvest, Virginia. dual match, and
the Mountaineer representative again
gained the judges’ decision to annex
the welterweight title. _

'Al Paslowski and Joe Kopp, the
other Pitt entrants, did not fare so
well. Both were defeated in the elim-
nation matches. Paslowski losing a.
hard-fought bout to Rubenstein of
Temple, and Kopp dropping his bout
by a technical K. O. to ‘Rittersbaugh
of lhfashington and Jefferson.

inscriptions “Pitt” and “Intramural”
worked on a modernistic base.

Marriage Debate
' To Be Repeated

Penn State Men To Meet Women
In Delta Sigma Rho Clash

The exchange debate on marriage
between the University women and
the Penn State men will be repeated
on the campus at the Delta‘ Sigma
Rho conference this Friday.

James Townsend, Penn State, and
Marguerite Swank, C35, will take the
affirmative side and Roy Wilkinson,
Penn State, and Marcella Leyton, C37,
will take the negative side of: “Re-
solved, that a male college graduate
earning a minimum salary of $1,500 a
year should marry before the age of
25.”

VVhen the speakers held the same
debate on the Penn State campus a
few weeks ago, the negative "side was
declared the winner in an audience
ballot.

“I,” said Miss Swank today, “am
hoping that our Pitt audience will be
more marriageably inclined after
they've heard our arguments. I ad-
mit I don't have much first-liand ex-
perience.”

Miss Swank also pointed out there
would be no loss in spontaneity in
having a second debate on the same
subject, because “you can't stereotype
marriage; new issues arise all the
time.”

Penn State college, which has also
been asked to debate the marriage
question with Rutgers college, on its
Eastern trip, will enter teams in the
other divisions of the Delta Sigma
Rho conference.

Of the 25 colleges and universities
invited to participate in the confer-
ence this year, 10 so far have accepted,
making a total of approximately 70

delegates.

to about 75 women, she had asked:
What selling techniques please cus-
tomers? and what practices and
methods irritate them?

Discussing the attitudes or slants
of each customer class, Miss Amos

made several customer distinctions,.

one of which, the non-earning group,
included students, who as a rule are
economically dependent on their par-

group, and store employes themselves.
