Meningitis victim recovering

By John Zaphyr

Assistant News Editor

Kevin Burns, the Pitt student who
was infected with meningococcal men-
ingitis, is in stable condition as of last
night. According to Burns’ mother, he
is still under supervision at Montefiore
Hospital but is coming along well.

Burns, a member of the Pi Kappa
Alpha fraternity, attended a Feb. 14
Valentine’s Day party and it was
following the party that he began show-
ing symptoms of the disease.

Meningococcal meningitis is a very
contagious disease, especially in close
quarters, but so far no related cases
have been reported. The disease causes
fever, intense headache. nausea and

vomiting, stiff neck and rash. If the
disease is left untreated it may progress
to shock, delirium, coma and eventual-
ly death. All the individuals present at
the party have received preventive
treatment.

“Our main concern was getting the
medication to the brothers,” said Gary
Houston, executive assistant to the vice

' president. “We followed county health

rules and handled the situation as well
as possible.”

Although no more incidents of men-
ingitis have been reported, one Pitt stu-
dent received a scare earlier in the
week. Sophomore T.J . O’Leary attend-
ed the Valentine’s Day party and began

to develop some of the symptoms of-

meningitis.
“I was vomiting and had intense
headaches,” said O’Leary. “I went to

the University Health Center, and they
said I had enough of the symptoms to
go to the hospital.”

O’Leary was taken to Presbyterian
Hospital, where he underwent testing
for the disease. It was decided there
that he would need a spinal tap to deter-
mine whether or not O’Leary did in
fact have the disease.

A spinal tap is the process in which
fluid is extracted from within the spine

so that it may be tested for infection. .

“They made me get in the fetal posi-
tion and gave me three injections,” said
O’Leary. “The ﬁrst two were for
novocaine and they really hurt, and in
the last injection, they took some of my
spinal ﬂuid out.”

The tests showed that O’Leary did
not have meningitis, and he should be
well in a week or two. '

Marcos relinquishes his power

Aquino assumes Filipino presidency

By William Young
Staff Writer

After a 20-year reign, Philippine
President Ferdinand Marcos has step-
ped down and ﬂed the country.

The beginning of the end came when
former Defense Minister'Juan Ponce
Enrile and Lt. Gen. Fidel Ramos
resigned from their positions and took
over the Defense Ministry with military
troops last Saturday and called for Mar-
cos to relinquish power.

The Philippines public was quick to
come to their aid as nearly 15,000 sup-
porters surrounded the rebel camp on
Sunday and built barricades to keep

troops still loyal to Marcos from get- .

ting through. Public unrest continued
to grow under the self-declared provi-
sional government which pledged
allegiance to President Corazon

Aquino. Meanwhile, Marcos continued

to issue statements on television Sun-
day and Monday stating that he was in

control and that the uprising would
soon be quelled. _ .

During onesuch broadcast by Mar-
cos, the state-owned television station
was attacked and captured by the
rebels, silencing Marcos and giving the
rebels a new medium with which to
reach the public.

Pressure calling for Marcos’ resigna-
tion from the United States became
stronger after the provisional govern-
ment was announced. Negotiations be-
tween Enrile and Marcos began to en-
circle the presidential palace and made
it clear that they would no longer
tolerate his rule. Marcos changed his
position of opposing the rebels and
agreed to step down when Enrile
assured him that he would be given safe
passage from the country.

After Marcos announced his abdica-
tion of power, four American
helicopters ﬂew to the palace to pick

4 up Marcos, his wife, children, and 30

trusted aides and transferred them to
the U.S. Clark Air Force Base for the
night while deciding where to go into

_ exile.

When A news of Marcos’ leaving
reached the public, reaction was swift.
Hundreds of civilians ransacked the
presidential palace in Manila, despite
the pleas‘ for calm by rebel leaders. The
mobs, chanting “long live Cory, Mar-
cos is a thief,” ripped portraits of Mar-
cos and his wife Imelda from the walls
and set them on fire.

The jubilant mobs‘ shattered the
chandeliers and hurled government
records out of the second-ﬂoor win-
dows of the palace.

Rioting and looting were prevalent
in Manila yesterday and numerous skir-
mishes were fought between looters

and soldiers. Fears that troops still I

loyal to Marcos might launch an attack
on the rebels dissipated when it became
clear that Marcos would not attempt to
reclaim power. V

After his overnight stay at Clark Air

"Force Base, Marcos and those seeking

exile with him boarded U.S. planes and
headed for the U.S. territorial island
of Guam. The United States has pro-
mised Marcos a “safe haven” if he
should seek asylum here, but Marcos
has hinted that he does not wish to sta

Earlier meningitis case
found fatal to student

By David James
Staff Writer '

Contrary to earlier statements by university and student health service
officials, Kevin Burns is not the only Pitt student to have contracted men-
ingococcal meningitis in the recent past.

The Pitt News was informed Monday that student Jeff Lyons contracted
-the disease in the fall of 1985 and as a result died last Sept. 29.

Lyons, his friends reported, had been feeling run-down and bothered
by a nagging cough for about a week before being hospitalized. At the
time, his roommates said, they believed it was nothing serious. By early
evening Friday, Sept. 27, Lyon’s condition had seriously deteriorated,
and he was taken to Presbyterian Hospital by a roommate.

According to reports by Lyons’ friends, his organs stopped function-
ing the following day, and he was placed on a hospital life-support system.
Later that day Lyons recovered enough to be removed from the life-support
system, his friends said. The next morning, however, Lyons died.

Franklin Carter, director of Student Health Services, and Mary Anne
Aug of Pitt’s Department of News and Publications reported having no
knowledge of any other cases of meningococcal meningitis involving

However, upon receiving confirmation of Lyons’ death from a relative
and placing numerous calls to university offrces, Gary Houston, executive
assistant to the vice president, said the student health services had forgot-

“In late Sept. of 1985, we found out that astudent living off-campus
had contracted meningococcal meningitis,” Houston said. “He was taken
to Presbyterian Hospital where he expired.”

Helmut Schmidt to speak
today at Heinz lecture

The former chancellor of the Federal
Republic of Germany, Helmut
Schmidt, will present the fourth H.J.

Heinz Company Foundation Distin-,

guished Lecture at the University of
Pittsburgh today at 5 p.m. in the
William Pitt Union. He will speak on
“A Changing World: Political
Strategies in the Late‘ ’80s.”

Schmidt was the German chancellor
for eight years, from May 1974 until
October 1982. Trained as an
economist, he served as joint minister
of economics and finance and also
defense minister in earlier
governments.

Schmidt was born in Hamburg in
1918 and ended his wartime service as
an army first lieutenant and battery
commander. He then studied
economics and political science at
Hamburg University. At the universi-
ty he became a member of the Social
Democrat Party and, while still a stu-

A dent, worked with the Hamburg Office

for Economics and Transport. From
1953 to 1961 he was a member of the
Bundestag (the lower house of the
federal parliament), and from 1961 to
1965 served as senator for interior af-
fairs in Hamburg. He was -re-elected

to the Bundestag in 1965, and served '

as ﬂoor leader from 1967 to 1969. In
October 1969, he assumed the office
of federal defense minister. He went
on to serve as economist for the joint
minister of federal economics and
finance and later as federal finance
minister.

Schmidt was elected federal
chancellor in 1974 and re-elected in
1976 and 1980. He left the office in Oc-
tober._1982.

Helmut Schmidt.

As chancellor, Schmidt made the
political unification of Europe, in
partnership with the United States, one
of his principal, concerns. Doinestical-
ly. he addressed the concerns of West
Germany’s unemployed and worked to
maintain his country‘s low rate of in-
ﬂation while keeping West Germany’s
trade volume the highest in Western
Europe.

Schmidt was one of the founders of
the economic summit conferences

begun in 1975 and was the only.

political leader who tookpart in all
eight summit sessions from 1975
through 1982.

He is the author of “Defense or
Retaliation: A German View” and‘

“The Balance of Power: Germany’s .

Peace Policy and the Superpowers,”

MOSCOW — Soviet chief Mikhail
Gorbachev is rejecting President
Reagan’s latest arms control proposal
and raising a threat to further delay
summit talks between the two leaders
of the world superpowers. Gorbachev
rejected the arms proposals in a speech
to the 27th Communist Party Congress
in Moscow. He also added that he sees
no point in the two leaders meeting for
what he referred to as “empty talks.”
The two had agreed at last year’s sum-
mit to meet in the United States this
year.

Thiokol engineer
says NASA knew

United States —- Morton-Thiokol’s
chiefengineer at the John F. Kennedy
Space Center said he‘s "absolutely
sure“ warnings against launching the
shuttle Challenger were passed along
to top NASA officials before the fateful
liftoff last month. Allen McDonald
testified under oath to the Presidential
Commision iiivestigatiiig the Il'L1_*._lCd_\’.
He said NASA booster—rocket chief
Lawrence Mulloy made some com-
ments “about when we’ll ever lly if we
have to live with that." Morton-
Thiokol is the ﬁrm that builds the solid-
fuel booster rocket suspected of causing
the destruction of the shuttle.

Protestant heads
talk with Thatcher

LONDON — Northern Ireland prot-
estant leaders met with British Prime
Minister Thatcher yesterday and asked
her to scrap the agreement giving
Ireland a voice in their area. Thatcher
said no, but she did agree to discuss
restoring limited home rule for
Northern Ireland. She agreed with their
suggestion that all the parties in
Northern Ireland get together for a
discussion. London started ruling the
province in 1972 in response to
spreading violence.

Nazi criminal
to be extradited

WASHINGTON — The government
is trying to turn John Demjanjuk over
to Israel to be tried as a Na‘/.i war
criminal. Dcmjanjuk is accused of kill-
ing nearly one million Jews during
World War II. but he said he is being
mistaken for the actual criminal. The
Supreme Court denied his appeal
yesterday. A State Department official
signed a warrant. and the Justice

Gorbachev rejects latest arms proposal

Department is working on details to
transfer him to Israel. Demjanjuk is
presently in a prison hospital in
Missouri.

More violence
in South Africa

South Africa — South African
police said a black woman was burned
to death during the night when radical
youths firebombed her house. Two
other houses were also attacked. The
firebombing occurred in Port
Elizabeth. Elsewhere in South Africa.
police said two whites in a car fired on
a 14-year-old boy and wounded him in
the leg. No apparent motive is known
for the attack.

Iran launches
second offensive

TEHERAN. Iran — Iran claimed to
have destroyed two Iraqi infantry
battalions while repelling a eounterat-
tack north of an Iraqi oil port it oc-
cupied during its last offensive. Iraqi

forces claim to have captured several
points near the port after their
counterattack last week which sur-
rounded the invaders. Iran also said it
inflicted “heavy casualties" on Iraqi
forces during a new offensive in north-
eastern Iraq. There was no independent
confirmation of either side’s claims.

As a result of recent fighting, Iran
has issued a call for war-experienced
Basijis to report to their local centers
as a result of some 30,000 Iranian
soldiers now encircling the Fao Peiiin—
sula. Iran claims it can field some three
million volunteers.

The United Nations Security Coun-
cil adopted a resolution urging both
sides to halt hostilities immediately and
withdraw their forces to interiiational—
ly recognized borders. The resolution
condemned the use_ of chemical
weapons in the war. the attacking of
purely civilian population centers and
the attacking of neutral shipping in the
gulf.

Mandatory tests
for blood donors

WASHINGTON — The government
is proposing maiidatory screening of all
blood and plasma donations for
evidence of AIDS antibodies. An FDA
spokesman says the regulation would
be “something to fall back on" since

AIDS antibodies voluntarily after the
government recommended they begin
doing so last year.

According to Houston, the student health services were notiﬁed by either

Presbyterian Hospital or the Allegheny'County Ofﬁce of Disease Control. -

“They [Presbyterian Hospital or Allegheny Disease Control] also treated
Lyons’ roommates and his girlfriend,” said Houston, “and we checked
to see if he was in any other groups, and [we] determined that he wasn’t.”
Houston stated that Lyons basically kept to himself.

In interviews with Lyons’ roommates, Andy Strebel and David Faiola,
both juniors at Pitt, it was confirmed that treatment had been given to
approximately eight individuals. Strebel and Faiola expressed their con-
fusion over the differences in the way the Lyons and the Burns cases have
been handled by university authorities.

“I can’t see why this one is so highly publicized,” said Faiola in

reference to the Burns case, “and nothing was said about Jeff dying.”'

Jeff Mazza, a close friend of Lyons, expressed similar sentiments. “I’m
not advocating panic or a whole bunch of publicity," Mazza said, “but
I think people should have at least been told what happened. Don't you
owe people that much, just to tell them about it and let them handle it
as they will?”

Faiola added that the situation was made worse by unsympathetic
teachers whose attitudes made it difficult for him to concentrate on his
studies.

“I think just because Jeff wasn’t in a fraternity or wasn‘t in any organiza-
tions doesn’t mean that he kept to himself,” Faiola said. “He had a lot
of friends  and a lot of students attended his funeral.”

Houston stressed that the two cases are not connected. University
representatives said that these are the only two cases of meningococcal
meningitis reported since 1970.

Old Proposals In Old Clothes

. I.’

5:.

A month ago, Soviet leader Gorbachev
advanced a sweeping package of arms
control proposals. The U.S. response to
those proposals came this week, when
President Reagan sent a letter proposing
the elimination of all U.S. and Soviet
medium range nuclear missiles in Europe
over a three—year period. As with all arms
control offers, whether Soviet or
American, the latest offer must be
carefully scrutinized to sort out the real
content from mere political maneuvering.
As it turns otit, the latest Reagan arms
control offer is both constructive and
realistic, but it fails to address some
crucial outstanding issues.

The elimination of medium range
missiles in Europe is a very important
step in reducing nuclear tensions. The
high"-technology cruise and Pershing
missiles currently being deployed repre-
sent one of the most destabilizing aspects
of the entire arms race. These missiles
can strike at the heart of Soviet territory
in a matter of inintites, severely reduc-
ing the margin of time the Soviets have
for assessing the nature of a potential
threat. Cruise missiles are even more

dangerous in that they can ﬂy undetected
underneath the Soviet early—warning
radars, and are accurate enough to form
part of a potential U.S. first strike. By
threatening Soviet security, we threaten
our own security in turn, since we in—
crease the chance of an ill-considered and
potentially catastrophic Soviet reaction in
any crisis situation.

For these reasons, any arms control
proposal which aims at eliminating these
missiles, together with their Soviet
counterparts. the SS-20s, mtist be
welcomed and supported. Further. the
current Reagan proposal stands a better
chance of being accepted than any other
proposal in a long time for two reasons:
First. it is relatively concrete and siin—
ple. and puts forward a strict timetable
for completion. Secondly, the Soviets
made the very same proposal themselves
just last month.

The stated goal of the Soviet package
of proposals was the elimination of all
nuclear weapons by the year 2000. While

A this ultimate objective may be little more

than a utopian dream, the package they
put forward nevertheless contained a long

list of constructive components —- in— .

cluding the Reagan counter-offer itself.
the elimination of medium range missiles
in Europe. The Reagan counter-offer in
effect takes just one of the proposals from
the Soviet package and returns it to them
as a new proposal. Considered purely on
its own merits, the U.S. proposal is con-
structive and realistic. We should not.
however. ignore the fact that by making
just the limited counter—offer, the Reagan
administration is deliberately ignoring the
many other important proposals in the
Soviet package. It is hoping that the
public will conveniently forget the fact
that the Soviet package called for so much
more, in the way ofarms reductions. than
the mere elimination of medium range
weapons. Thus. mixed up with a con-
structive arms control offer, we find that

‘ the administration is attempting to reverse
the propaganda advantage that the Soviets
have been gradually acquiring over the
last few months.

In particular, the latest U.S. offer is in—
tended to divert attention from the fact
that Gorbachev proposed that the two
superpowers immediately agree to ban all

nuclear testing. The U.S. response to this
offer has been a stunning silence, despite
the fact that the Soviets went so far as to
extend their own unilateral testing
moratorium for another 90 days. An end
to nuclear testing is a critical step in
halting the ongoing arms escalation, and
so the failure of the United States to agree
to a testing ban is a signiﬁcant cause for
alarm.

In truth, the U.S. counter-proposal is
not an exact repeat of that part of the
Soviet package which called for the
elimination of medium range missiles.
Bundled together with that demand. the
Soviets also called fora freeze on British
and French medium rang; ; missiles. This

fused then by the Soviets since — as they
argued — they needed medium range
weapons to counter the existing British
and French missiles. Thus, when the
Soviets this year effectively re—proposed
the zero option, while calling only for a
freeze on British and French weapons,
they were making a significant new con-
cession. In rejecting the freeze demand,
the United States is asking the Soviets to
retreat even further in the -veryiarea where
they have already made a major conces-
sion. Bargaining tactics like this are not
exactly conducive to success in negoti-
ating arms control agreements. They do,
however, make cunning political tactics,
because it may now look as ifthe Soviets’

are just stalling on the apparently "A

reasonable U.S. offer.

In short. the Reagan counter—proposal.
like nearly all offers in the past —
whether  or Soviet —- is a mixture

The proposed elimination of medium
range missiles in Europe is just a new
version of the "zero option" put forward
by the United States in 1981 ._ It wastre-

political machination and simple pro-
paganda. We should welcome it as far as
it goes. but also realize that does not go
nearly far enough — and in particular
does not go as far as the Soviets have
already been.

On The Far Side Of Crazy/David James
it-Is There Method To This Madness?

Whenever I come home from a long
trip or a weekend away I always do the
same thing. As soon as I’ve dumped
my luggage in the vicinity of the front
door, I go straight to my room. My
clean room. I smile a lot while I stand
there in my room. It’s not that I’m sur-
prised to find my room clean; after all
I clean it myself before I leave. But I
smile nonetheless.

I don’t know why I always clean
before a trip. Maybe it’s because I
know my hotel room will be neat, and
I want the same treatment when I get
home.

My father and I had vastly differing
opinions on cleaning. He called what
I did “reorganizing" and felt it should
not be confused with cleaning. When

 I would ﬁnish cleaning my room he’d

say to me, “All you’ve done is move
the mess around; it’s just reorganized.’ ’

I’m kind of funny about reorganiz-
ing. If it’s important to me, I’m happy
to spend hours at it. For instance, when
I move into a new room I give a lot of
serious thought to just where my phone
should be. I can spend days moving
furniture and pictures around trying to
find just the “right” look.

Laundry is a big part of reorganiz-
ing. Since my dirty clothes are always
right in the middle of my ﬂoor, I usual-
ly start with them. If it’s a really big
reorganization, I wash all my clothes,
even the ones that are still clean.

My desk is the scene of continual
reorganization. Recently I got a few
folders so I could keep my schoolwork
organized. One thing led to another,

and now I’ve got more than forty dif-
ferent categories and organized
material. All that from a simple idea
to _keep each class syllabus and
assignments separate.

One folder is for things I ’m finished
working on but still want to keep. You
never know when something you've
already finished will satisfy some new
requirement. I have a folder for things
I just haven’t got around to finishing
yet. That one’s labeled “works in pro-
gress.  I also have a folder for things
I haven’t started yet. That one’s labeled
“ideas,” and I must admit it’s the
thickest folder in the drawer. This piece
will probably hit all three at some
point. I even have a folder where I keep
all my unused folders.

At this point you probably think I’m

some kind of neat nut. Nothing could
be further from the truth. Sometimes
I go three weeks at a time living in a
constantly shifting, growing pile of
filthy jeans. I’m not sure why I spend
the next week frothing over one un-
matched sock, or why I keep that sock
in a. special folder marked “unfinished
reorganization.”

One thing I do know about my
sporadic outbursts is that the motiva-
tion comes from within. I lack that cer-
tain desire when I’m doing it for some-
one else. I tend to take shortcuts like
reorganizing my socks to a spot under
my bed or reorganizing the leaves in
our yard into the neighbor’s.

What I really need is someone who
could do all my reorganizing for me.
Unfortunately my mother’s main

Senator John Heinz has sent a final
letter to Oscar Swindle, director of the
Economic Development Administra-
tion in Washington, D.C., urging him
to approve a measure assuring $1
million for development of a local high-
tech research center, according to
Heinz’s office.

If approved, funds will go towards
establishing the University of Pitts-
burgh’s proposed Regional Technology
Development Center in Harmarville,
Pa.

In the letter to Swindle, Heinz
writes, “The center would bring high-
tech jobs to an area which has ex-
perienced a terrible erosion of its tradi-
tional manufacturing employment base.

Fifty years ago this March, Michael
J. Koch and Paul Kenny set out with
4X5 cameras to record the St. Patrick’s
Day ﬂood in Pittsburgh. Some of the
results of their efforts are on exhibit at
the Courthouse Gallery/Forum from
March 7 through April 4, 1986. Most
of the photographs, on loan from the
collection of Lois Muzzey, are the
original black and white prints.

The ﬂooded downtown area was
amply recorded. A general view of the
Point is followed up with a detailed tour
of Liberty Avenue at Fifth, Seventh,
10th and 11th streets. Even the old
B&O Railroad Station is included.

Although their equipment was
cumbersome and travel was slow, the

two photographers managed to cover.

Merton Center discusses El Salvador

By Teresa Candori
Staff Writer

El Salvador is becoming another
Vietnam, warned representatives of the
Thomas Merton Center and The Pitts-
burgh Committee for Health Rights in
Central America at a presentation last
week.

“Witness to War,” a short
documentary chronicling the work of
an American doctor working in the
rebel—occupied zones in El Salvador,
was shown at the presentation, and
Roger Schrading, formerly of the
Washington Office on Latin America,
spoke of his personal experience while
traveling in El Salvador.

The film, nominated for a 1984
Academy Award, depicts the story of
Dr. Charlie Clemens, a former captain
in the Air Force, who spent two years
working in an austere clinic in the
countryside of Guazapa, El Salvador.

Clemens’ hospital, which was large
enough to admit four patients at a time,
was made of adobe. At one point in the
film, Clemens explains that the only
material he could use for bandages was
mosquito netting, since the purchase of
large amounts of gauze roused suspi-
cion of subversion in government
authorities.

The authorities soon realized
however, that the mosquito netting was
indeed being used to treat rebels and
peasants in occupied zones, and
Clemens began using diapers instead.
Clemens recalled how one woman
riding on a rural bus was killed by
government soldiers because she did
not have an adequate excuse for car-
rying 12 diapers with her.

Clemens decided to go to E1_Salvador
in 1982 after treating Salvadoran
refugees who came to the United States
after “ being tortured by the death
squads. The squads, as depicted in the

ﬁlm,-are composed of oft-duty: military, i

 

personnel.
During his tour as a pilot in the Air
Force, Clemens ﬂew 50 bombing mis-

' sions in Vietnam. The day before the

invasion of Cambodia. Clemens says
in the film he decided that he could not,
in good conscience. continue. He was
then sent to a hospital in San Antonio
to undergo psychiatric observation.
Clemens received an honorable
discharge in 1971 and entered medi-cal
school soon after to become a doctor.

Following the half—hour movie,
Roger Schrading, formerly of the
Washington Office on Latin America,
told of his experiences in El Salvador.
Schrading returned from El Salvador

last Saturday after having spent four '

months in Central America.

“I wanted to see everything for

myself,” Schrading said. He had
planned to travel more extensively, but
he felt the need to remain longer in El
Salvador.

“I really felt challenged to respond
to what I had seen and what I knew

about El Salvador.”Schrading said.

Schrading stressed the fact that in-
formation about the situation in El
Salvador is suppressed by the govern-
ment ,in the nation’s capital. San
Salvador. "Everything has to come
through the military press agency. The
information is very controlled." he
said.

Schrading replied to questions from
the audience following his lecture.
Asked if there is a draft in El Salvador.
he responded, “I was on the bus one
day and these soldiers stopped the bus
and took away all the men who looked
the right age. That’s their draft."

A church worker who had visited
Salvadoran refugee camps was present
at the lecture. He asked to remain
anonymous for fear that Salvadoran
authorities would not allow him to
return to the camps. He said that an in-
ternational presence in the camps deters
acts of violence by the military, who
claim the refugees are sympathetic to
the rebels.

The ﬂag that is raised daily by the Army ROTC cadets here at the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh was also ﬂown over the state capitol in Harrisburg earlier
this year. This came about when Pitt’s Amiy ROTC detachment requested,
by way of Senator John Heinz’s office. that Pitt receive a ﬂag that had

ﬂown over the state capitol.

The request came from the senior Army ROTC cadets who will graduate
in April and receive commissions as second lieutenants. The cadets wanted
to do something to commemorate their final year at Pitt and decided a
flag that had flown in Harrisburg was an appropriate choice.

The same ﬂag is ﬂown on the Cathedral of Learning ﬂagpole by the
Army ROTC cadets Monday through Friday. The flag raising takes place
at 8 am. and the ﬂag is lowered at 5 p.m.

‘Old American’ tastes
return to food scene 

A look at the menus of some rather
ﬂashy restaurants shows they are serv-
ing dishes like meat loaf and chicken-
fried steak with fresh fruit cobbler for
dessert.

Cookbook author Miriam Ungerer of
Long Island said, “American cooking
has been on a roller-coaster of ex-
perimentation for some years now and
is better for it.” She has turned her
casual entertaining into books called
“Good Cheap Food” and “Country
Food.”

The list of restaurants serving down-
home delicacies goes on and on.
There’s An American Place in New
York, Celebration in Dallas, First
Street in Chicago and Foumou’s Ovens
at the Stanford Hotel in San Francisco,
to name a few.

 

In Manhattan, for instance, Miss
Ruby’s Cafe went looking for some of
its best ideas in the spiral-bound
cookbooks published across America
by junior leagues. The result is a menu
that includes dishes such as chicken
fricassee, the sort of thing mother
would serve.

Maybe that is the clue. Allan Borut,
a co-owner of Wolensky’s Bar and
Grill in Washington, D.C., said,
“There’s no question that there are
many customers who are interested in
basic foods.” He said these are peo-
ple who have eaten out their entire lives
and are looking for foods that remind
them of the times that they did eat at
home.

Natasha Henderson
For The Pitt News

Do you know anyone on Pitt’s

campus who is a budding Thomas
Jefferson?

Contemporary scholars speculate

that today’s college students operate
in a setting where little is expected
of them and little opportunity is
given to them to exercise leader-

ship.

According to Webster, college is
a self-governing constituent body of
a university offering instruction in
professional, vocational and
technical ﬁelds. Others believe col-
lege is a place where we pursue
knowledge for knowledge’s sake.
Then there are those who believe
college is the place for forming a
bridge between the academic and
the practical. Possibly the most
commonly ignored and yet the most
important deﬁnition is that college
is a place to cultivate enlightened
leadership, the means from which
promising leaders are bred.

But this objective and purpose,
according to many sources in
academia, is not being met.
Scholars believe that modern col-
leges are not doing all they can to
effectively produce genuine
leaders. Year after year, colleges
are turning out thousands of
students who are qualiﬁed and well-
prepared to compete in their ﬁelds
of study. However, not many of
these scholars have practiced the
qualities a leader possesses in a col-
lege setting that are undoubtedly
utilized in a working environment.

In an editorial by Ed Wheeler ap-
pearing in the Dec. 1985 issue of
the Chronicle of Higher Education,
it is stated that colleges today are
well-geared for turning out
academics and intellectuals, but are
much less effective in producing the
Thomas J effersons of our nation’s
past. The article claims colleges are

not sufﬁciently addressing and
cultivating leadership through
student-life activities on campus.
The article accuses organizations
(i.e. student government, frater-
nities and sororities) that claim to

instill leadership qualities, of being V

of questionable value. The article
suggests that these organizations

are more often clusters in which
students congregate to socialize. It
is said that their ability to instill
leadership qualities is highly
doubtful.

Bridget Guernsey, advisor for
Pitt’s Interfraternity Council,
disputes this point of view. “I
receive calls from numerous
recruitors, Procter and Gamble and
Johnson and Johnson to name a
few, requesting interviews from
students who have been involved
with sororities and fraternities,”
said Guernsey. “They are attracted
to these students because they have
worked with and been involved
with stabilized groups and situa-
tions that have involved manage-
ment decisions.” Guernsey claims
that both fraternity and sorority
members are advised on leadership
skills from their national chapters.
“Try and tell a house manager or
atreasurer of a sorority or a frater-
nity that they don’t do anything that
entails leadership qualities and I

‘ ‘Researchers have proven
that leadership can be
developed through training
programs, provided the par-
ticipants are motivated,
energetic and self—conﬁdent
and have a strong determina-
tion to succeed. ”

Assistant Director of
Student Activities

think they could produce a convinc-
ing argument against the specula

milrllhy is leadership so important
and what is Pitt doing to combat
these accusations?

According to a recent study on
leadership and programs on student
development at Pitt, the role of
leaders is the critical determinant in
aiding the growth of members and

‘the organization itself. Many social
scientists believe that training in the
speciﬁcs of group leadership is ab-
solutely essential to organizational
development and achievement of

Today’s colleges groom tomorrow’s leaders

 

Wesley Posvar and Pitt’s current leaders address graduates at the 1985 commencement.

positive growth-oriented goals,
especially in the maturation of a
student.

Aristotle, the ancient Greek
philosopher, said that leaders
possess a number of innate traits
that set them apart from other in-
dividuals. He said _these
characteristics enabled them to
automatically become leaders. This
notion, still thought to be accurate
by some today, implies that leaders

are born, not made. However,

research in the field of leadership
development has disputed this
assumption.

Recent studies done by social
scientists on the topic of leadership
provide us with information that
leads us to believe that more ac-
curately, leaders are made, not
born. The study suggests that
leadership skills are developed and
learned from parents, teachers or
other role models iniaddition to the
structured learning experiences
which take into consideration an in-
dividual’s personality, motivation
and aspirations.

Joyce Giangarlo, assistant direc-
tor of student activities, said she
believes leaders can be made.

mmencement exercises.

“Researchers have proven that
V leadership can be developed
through training programs, pro-
vided the participants are
motivated, energetic, self-conﬁdent
and have a strong determination to
succeed,” said Giangarlo.

She believes there are speciﬁc
skills and attitudes necessary for ef-
fective leadership. Skills such as
planning and goal setting, problem
solving and decision making can be
learned and better developed
through specialized training
experiences. ‘

The Ofﬁce of Student Activities
has recognized the problem of
cultivating leaders in higher educa-
tion and has taken steps to

— Brigette Gernie,

Advisor for Pitt ’s
Interfraternitv Council

ameliorate the problem here at the
University of Pittsburgh. They have
responded with plans for extensive
student development and leadership
programs.

According to Andy Smith, direc-
tor of student activities, student
leadership development is a priority
goal with the Student Activities Of-
fice. With approximately 200 stu-
dent organizations and a student
population of 20.000, there exists
‘a need for a student leadership
program.

In response to this concern. Pitt
is currently involved with three
leadership programs for its
students.

However. one of them.,the An-
nual Leaders Program. which has
been open to any person active in
student activities. was cancelled for
the first time in seven years because
it could no longer be ﬁnanced by
the university. ‘ . ‘ n

which large and small organizations
wish to improve in an area by in-
viting freshly educated young talent
to come in and observe manage-
ment decisions and to help decide
questions on speciﬁc subjects per-

taining to their company.- By

meeting and interacting with
students, it enables both the student
and the corporation to beneﬁt.

Most promising for the leader-
ship programs is the Emerging
Leader Program. In 1979, the
University of Pittsburgh’s Division
of Student Affairs, in conjunction
with the Department of Counselors,
developed the program to address
the developmental needs of
freshmen. Pitt is one of only about
a dozen schools that are currently
funding the program. Giangarlo
claims that the university is even‘
actively involved with selling the
program to other institutions of
higher learning.

The Emerging Leader Program
is primarily an experiential and
cognitive learning exercise de-
signed to increase the understand-

ing and effectiveness of group i

leadership. The emphasis of this
program is placed on bridging the
gap between theory and practice
through planned laboratory ex-
periences in each topic area, as well
as by actual participation in student
organizations. The program is
designed for freshmen because it is

the belief of the program’s pioneers .

that the first year of college affords
the greatest opportunity for impact

on the personal development of

students.

The purpose of the Emerging
Leaders Program is to teach leader-
ship skills which will help freshman
students develop competencies that
will enable them to assume leader-
ship roles in campus organizations
and will enhance their personal
growth and development. The pro-
gram provides the student with the
structure they need to identify their
personal strengths. weaknesses. at-
titudes and abilities in the area of
leadership. It is believed that par-
ticipation in developmental pro-
grams such as leadership training
will not only benefit the individual
but also enhance the quality of cam-

S pus life through subsequent im-

provement in student organizations

But what exactly is sexual harass-
ment? Statistics indicate it exists. The
Washington Post estimated in 1981 that
20 percent of all college women have
been sexually harassed. Are_ sexist
comments in the classroom a form of
sexual harassment? And where ‘does
Pitt draw the line?

The Provost’s Advisory Committee.

on Women’s Concerns (PACWC) ad-
dressed these questions and submitted
a report to the provost last May. The
committee consists of 19 concerned
women from various schools and
departments of the university. The
PACWC evaluated studies made on
other campuses across the country, and
came up with the following deﬁnition
of sexual harassment for the Universi-
ty of Pittsburgh.

Pitt deﬁnes sexual harassment as any
sexual advance where:

— Submission is made an explicit
or implicit term or condition of a stu-
dent’s academic progress or an in-
dividual’s employment;

—- Submission or rejection of the
sexual advance is used as the basis for
academic decisions affecting a student
or employment decisions affecting an
individual;

— Such conduct substantially in-
terferes with a student’s or employee’s
performance or creates an intimidating,
hostile or offensive academic or work-
ing environment.

Reading Pitt’s ofﬁcial policy may not
give everyone a clear idea of how sub-
tle sexual harassment can be. It is more
than demanding sexual favors or
threatening job security. Sexual harass-
ment can include suggestive comments
made by anyone in a working or
classroom situation. Nearly anything
that makes people feel uncomfortable
because of gender and interferes with
academic progress can be classiﬁed as
harassment. For example, humor and
jokes about sex that create a hostile
working environment are now- pro-
hibited in classrooms at Pitt.

The most frequent type of harass-
ment at universities is verbal. A recent
study done ‘at Pennsylvania State
University concluded that 24 percent
of Penn State’s female students had

 

been harassed sexually, that is about
2,800 students —- the large majority of
them harassed verbally.

A study conducted at the Arizona
State University campus found that
13.3 percent of female students there
had received at least verbal harassment
representing about 2,300 students.

While these numbers may seem
substantial, they can only give us an
idea of how many are touched by the
problem. It is equally important to
recognize how sexual harassment af-
fects and changes people.

If a student is sexually harassed, even
verbally, it can be detrimental to that
student’s academic perfonnance. A
professor who usually calls on men in-
stead of women, whether intentional-
ly or not, can make women feel
frustrated and left out of the class.

These women may feel that it’s their
own fault, and that they should try to
participate more in class. But this will
not work if the professor’s teaching
practices don’t change. The professor’s
prevailing attitude may lead the student
to give up in the course, and could even
affect the person’s commitment to a
particular ﬁeld.

“The way it becomes serious is if
women aren’t being taken seriously as
students —- it’s demeaning and
humiliating,” Vanda said.

Sexual harassment also adversely af-
fects male students. While the majori-
ty of harassment is directed toward
women, male students who have sex-
ist views may have these opinions rein-
forced in a class in which women are
stereotyped. In these classes, men may
have difﬁculty thinking of women as
peers, and they may ﬁnd it hard to
work with them.

This kind of condescending attitude
encouraged by a class may even lead
to marriage and family relationships
difﬁculties after college.

Graduate students are usually in a
more precarious position than
undergraduates when dealing with sex-
ual harassment. These students are
closer in age to their professors, they
may have similar career objectives and

they work with professors more in ‘

private situations.
The real tragedy in any form of sex-

ual‘ harassment is the fact that most of
the incidents go unreported. In the
study at Penn State, only 4 percent of
the incidents were ever reported to
administrators. ,

A more popular outlet for the con-
fusion caused by sexual harassment is
talking about sexual harassment in-
cidents with friends. The Penn State
study showed that 70 percent of the vic-
tims told a female friend and only 12
percent chose to tell a faculty member.

Some victims, particularly graduate
students, do not report cases of sexual
harassment because they are afraid of
the consequences. More than just get-
ting a bad grade, a graduate student
might lose a much-needed recommen-
dation if he or she accuses a professor.

Studies have shown that many
students feel powerless in an academic
institution, and they think no one would
believe them. Still other students fear
a face-to-face confrontation with the
perpetrator. Another common fear of
students is that the harassment com-
plaint will be made public, thereby
embarrassing.

Since the enactment of Pitt’s new
sexual harassment policy, no incident
has been made public. The PACWC
ofﬁcials say that the professor in ques-
tion is usually given a phone call war-
ning him that his students are upset
about his sexist comments or actions,
and that sexual harassment of any
nature will not be permitted at the
University of Pittsburgh. If this doesn’t
solve the problem, PACWC ofﬁcials
say that stronger measures would be
taken against the perpetrator, including
a_full investigation of the incident.
investigation of the incident.

Vanda said it is important that the
victim of harassment try to address the

v problem directly.

“The ﬁrst thing I would talk about
with a victim is how the person can
solve the problem on their own,” she
said.

Another form of responding to a har-
assment incident is letter writing. The
Association of American Colleges
urges a victim to write a three-part let-
ter to the harasser, explaining his feel-
ings and why he feels this way. The
ﬁrst part of the letter should contain as

ment appears to be much less of a prob-

GREEKS LEND A HELPINQ

Dry Rush Slated For Fall

Beginning Fall 86, a dry
rush will be in effect for all
of the fraternities at the
University of Pittsburgh.
What exactly does a dry
rush mean for the Greeks
here at Pitt? It means that
during the official rush
period, which will begin on
September 2nd with the
Watermelon Picnic and will
end September 23rd, no

« fraternity on this campus

will be able to serve any
form of alcohol to any
rushee. The University im-
posed a dry rush on the
fraternities in order to
escape any liabilities should
anything result from a
minor comsuming alcohol
at one of the houses. The

‘IFC plans to play any active
role in the new rush pro-

gram. The schedual pro-
vides the prospective
Greeks with ‘a chance to
participate in a number of
IFC sponsored -events, in
order to get a chance to
view the Greek system at

Pitt as a whole, with all of

the houses participating in
these events. All of these
events will take place from
September 2nd to the 9th.
These events include the

Watermelon Picnic on
September 2nd, Meet the
Greeks on the 4th, a Swim
Party at Trees Pool on the
9th, and the possibilities of
a Video/Pizza Party and a
Band Party somewhere
within this period. After the
IFC functions end on the
9th, Open House begins for
all of the fraternities. -This
period lasts from September
10-23, and involves all of
the fraternities. having dry
rush functions in order to let
all of the rushees see the in-
dividual houses and decide
which one he would like to
join if he decides to join
one. _
Obviously, this is the first
time our fraternities have
had to deal with a dry rush.
It may be difficult the first
time though, but the IFC is
hoping that each house will

continue to have successful _

rush results. The IFC will be
helping each house by
holding various rush
seminars throughout this
semester and next to show
the fraternities ideas_.on how
to go about having a suc-
cessful dry rush.

Internal Vice President IFC

It's that time of the year again! No, not
springtime — Greek Week time, from March
8-15. And this year the events will be bigger
and better, resulting in the largest amount of
money ever raised. The charity that will be
the beneficiary is Helping Hand, a branch of

the United Way. Helping" Hand is special.

because all money received is distributed to
the unemployed in Pittsburgh through local

businesses, ones that give the needy double a

their money in goods and services.

The blood drives, one last month and one
coming up in March, should collect ‘over 1300
pints from the fraternity and sorority members.

Central Blood Bank was very pleased by the

641 pints already donated, since the January

Members of the National lnterfraternity
Conference (NIC) recently conducted an

V evaluation of the University of Pittsburgh

fraternity system. Their visit was a result of
an application submitted in October by the
lnterfraternity Council and the Office of Stu-
dent Activities. They were asked to consult
with various fraternity officers and Univer-
sity administrators so that they could
evaluate the present status of the lnterfrater-
nity Council and provide recommendations

, for further improvements and development.

Jonathan Brant, Executive Director of the

, NIC, and Wilford Butler, Executive Director

of Delta Upsilon Fraternity, comprised the
Evaluation Team and provided acomplete
written report with suggestions for the Inter-
fraternity Council. Among their suggestions
were establishing .a Parents Weekend,
developing an Alumni Interfraternity Coun-
cil, and broadening the overall public rela-
tions programs for the fraternity system.
The IFC officers will meet with the Evalua-
tion Team during the Northeast lnter'frater-
nity Conference February 27th to March 2nd
in New Brunswick, New Jersey. This meeting
will provide an opportunity for the officers
to discuss the report and establish a timeline

for action with the Evaluation Team.

Greeks Reach Outward

by Stephen L. Fox and Richard Platt

How often have you wondered
whether fraternities participate in
activities , other than those
described by their critics? Let's be
honest — fraternities have reputa-

tions for being elite social clubs

who care for none but
themselves. Do you believe this
to be true? Before-you answer,
ask yourself if you have all the
facts; then, and only then, can a
sound opinion be formed.
”Fine,” you say, ”but what are
the facts?”

The facts are, that in the past six
months, the Interfraternity Coun-
cil and its member fraternities
have contributed money, time,
energy and TLC to upwards of
twelve events — whether they
were charity fundraisers,
volunteer programs, or self-
organized activities. That's
boasting an average of over two
events per month; events which
are planned perhaps a year in ad-
vance and which take steadfast
dedication to get off the ground.
What are some of these events?

To begin with, last term IFC
members volunteered for the
Citipark’s sponsored SPORTS BY
ABILITY, NOT DISABILITY bowl-
ing tournament. In this tourna-
ment of over 800 bowlers, many
of whom have cerebral palsy,
spina bifida, etc., the volunteers
aided the participants with their

game. Though some may be bet-
ter bowlers than others, it was
easy to see they all shared an
abundance of enthusiasm and
determination. In addition, the
IFC (along with the sororities) had
members who volunteered for
the nationallytelevised Cerebral
Palsy Telethon which was hosted
by WTAE Channel Four in the
Pittsburgh area. Overa quarter of
a million dollars was raised just
in the Pittsburgh area, and will
aid tremendously in the treatment
and support of Cerebral Palsy.

_ Furthermore, the IFC is begi.n—
ning to create new programs for
disadvantaged kids. Big Brother
Day is a program which allows
both boys and girls to learn the

basics of racquetball and basket-

ball in a fun way — each
youngster has a big brother
selected who will not only teach
them the sports, but will also be
there just to talk to and give ad-
vice. One.was already scheduled,
and future sessions are being cur-
rently organized.

During Homecoming last term,
IFC and Panhel sponsored a
dunking booth which had several
of Pitt's personalities getting wet
for charity. Other charity events
include Greekweek, which has
Helping Hand‘ as the official
charity; Sigma Chi’s Derby Days,

where funds were raised for the
Rehabilitation Institute of Pitt-
sburgh; the Pi Kappa Phi Push-a-
thon, which raised funds for the
severely handicapped; and Phi
Gamma Delta's Pitt-Penn State
Run, which begins the day before
the football game and is the
means of bringing the game ball
to Pitt Stadium as well as raising
funds for charity.

The individual fraternities have
also started their own. war on
alcohol and drugs, by sponsoring
various programs and groups. Fi-
ji (Phi Gamma Delta) started a
chapter of B.A.D.D., or Brothers
Against Drunk.Driving, and just
last week, an Alcohol Awareness
Program was sponsored jointly
by Delta Tau Delta, Phi Kappa
Theta and Theta Chi.

Future events on the planning
blocks include an Easter Egg Hunt
for disadvantaged kids, a
cyclethon competition with
teams comprised of Pitt's 21
fraternities, and a banner which
can be signed by all to raise funds
for the American Heart
Association.‘ j

Now that the facts have been
presented, what is the answer to
the question first posed you?
Hopefully, this article has shown
that fraternities care about their
community, and are -taking
measures to improve it.

Sports Competitiveness Increasing

IFC Sports Update: ,

With the completion of four fall sports,
Sigma Alpha Epsilon leads in the All Sports
Trophy point race. Rounding out the top five
are : Delta Tau Delta, Sigma Chi, Pi Kappa‘
Alpha, and Phi Kappa’ Theta. Approximately
one hundred points separates the top five. This
reflects the competitiveness that now lingers
in our sports competition. It's good to see
more fraternities participating, something that
was not seen in the past.

The winter sport season has already begun
and has twenty fraternities participating in
Basketball. This was unheardof in the past.’
The wrestling ”season” is February 25 and 26
with many fraternities attempting to dethrone
and always tough Sigma Chisquad.

Fraternity swimmers can keep on practic-
ing because of a change in dates for the swim
meet. The date still must be determined, but
will probably be scheduled sometime in ear-
ly March. So keep practicing.

A ski trip is still in the planning stages for
early March. Start saving your money because
as soon as a date is set, spots will be on a first

come —— first serve basis.

  Students struggle with stress

By Kelly  Shaffer
Assistant Features Editor

Fran has slept four hours in three
days, and she has three more chapters
to read before her test tomorrow. She
hasn’t cleaned her apartment in a week,
the table is _littered with coffee cups and
cigarettes, the sink is ﬁlled with dirty
dishes, and glasses and papers are
strewn across the living room ﬂoor.

Fran is wearing the same sweatpants
and baggy shirt that she’s worn for the
last three days, and her hair is tied back
from her makeup—free face.

“I feel so helpless. I’ve really tried
to keep up this term, but having all
these tests at once is just too over-
whelming,” said Fran, a junior who
did not want to be identified. “Every
time I think about how much I have to
do, I feel like crying. The more I work,
the less I understand. I know that I’m

"going to fail.”

Like most of the students at Pitt right
now, Fran is facing one of the most
distressing times of the school year —
midterms.

No matter how you handle this time
of the year, midterms are bound to
cause some feelings of stress. Joe
Thaner, the graduate studentassistant
at Pitt’s Health Education Office,

agreed that college in general is a
stressful situation.

"‘Let’s face it. We come straight
from high school and go into college.
The pace here is much faster and the
workload is much heavier,” explained
Thaner. _

“Students are trying to handle
workloads that aren’t coordinated. In-

‘ ‘That ’s one of the reasons
midterms are so stressﬁtl.
People often set up their own
problems by procrastinating.
They get behind and then
have to handle a lot of
material that they don ’t

know. ’ ’
.—— Joe Thaner

Jradmte student assistant

dependent professors _ are assigning
homework and projects without know-
ing what other professors are assign-
ing,” said Thaner. “Depressingly
enough, there is no guarantee that you
will have enough time to complete
everything. All of it falls onto the
responsibility of the student.”

Responsibility is, of course, the key

word. If the student has kept up with
his homework and projects throughout
the term, then midterms may not be so
frantic. But this is a rare occurrence.
“That’s one of the reasons midtenns
are so stressful. People often set up
their own problems by pro-
crastinating,” said Thaner. “They get
behind and then have to handle a lot of
material that they don’t know.”
And the result is stress — in addi-
tion to a lot of coffee, cigarettes, caf-
feine pills or chocolate. Anything to
stay awake and calm frazzled nerves.

Deana Dobrowolski, a junior major-
ing in social work, said she feels that
her cigarette smoking increases during
the midterm period. “I smoke a lot
more; I’d say that I smoke about one-
third more cigarettes than regularly. If
all my tests weren’t in the same week,
I’d - be all right,” explained
Dobrowolski.

Other students seem to close out
other areas of their lives in order to
cope with the midterm crisis. “I stay
up later, and let the dishes pile up in
the sink, the clothes don’t get washed,
and the bed doesn’t get made. It’ll all
wait until after the tests,” explained
Jamie Panichella, a junior here at Pitt.

Ideally, the solution to the problems

of midterms is to study diligently
throughout the term. Since midterms
have already descended upon us, this
advice isn’t exactly timely. Students are
dealing with midterm stress right now,
with two months of unﬁnished work
and unstudied texts looming over them.

Looming tests, poor diets and lack
of sleep all combine to create the stress.

“The real key is to keep
things in perspective.- It ’s im-
portant to try hard; but you
add to the pressure if you
have a distorted image about
the test. ”

—— Joe ‘Thaner
graduate student assistant

According to Thaner, the indicators of

stress are: irritability, depression, rapid
heartbeat, inability to concentrate,
headaches, stomach aches and the in-
ability to sleep. Although these are the
symptoms of stress, having. one or
more does not automatically mean that
the student is suffering from a stress
disorder.

Periods of high stress may occur
when the student has had an unproduc-
tive day. “If the student has not ac-
complished what he or she had set out
to do, if there are unresolved issues,
then stress may occur,” said Thaner.

Thaner suggested that making a list
of things to do in order of importance
might create a less stressful situation.

-“Make a list of priorities,” said
Thaner. “When you get up, tackle the
first one; then you will have a sense of
accomplishment.'Also, the student will
have more energy, feel pumped—up,
because he has proved that he can do
it. If you put things off, you will feel
more anxious.”

Thaner identiﬁed the causes of stress
at midterm times as procrastination
throughout the term and the student’s
blowing the tests out of proportion.

“The real key isto keep things in
perspective,” he said. “Some people
approach tests as if each one were the
most important in the world. It’s im-
portant to try hard; but you add to the
pressure if you have a distorted image
about the test. Ideally, it shouldn’t be
[an image] of extreme anxiety; but

there is the added feature of making it

Pitt blows out UConn

A confidence booster

By Randy Miller
Assistant Sports Editor

This may be the confidence builder
the Pitt basketball team has needed. It
could boost the level high enough for
the Panthers to stage a strong showing
in the Big East tournament for the ﬁrst
time in the four years they’ve been in
the league.

In any event, Pitt ended a four—game
losing streak Monday night as they
thrashed Connecticut 79-51 at Fitz-
gerald Field House.

“It’s been a long time coming,” said
Pitt head coach Roy Chipman. “I
thought we played well. That’s just
about as loose as we’ve been this
season.” _

“We feel that all the teams
in the Big East are scared of
us because they know we
have outstanding talent. ”

— Darryl Shepherd

Only 5,167,fans, and quiet ones at
that, showed up on Senior Night to see
tne Panthers up_a disappointing Big
East’ record to 6-9.

“I guess the fans felt we didn’t live
up to our potential this year,” said Pitt
forward Demetreus Gore, who scored
17 points. “But as far as we’re con-
cerned, we did because we played hard
every game.” ‘

Pitt certainly demonstrated the
definition of hard work against Con-
necticut as they scored on fast breaks,
hit the jumpers and played tenacious
defense to grab an insurmountable 20-4
lead 11 minutes into the first half.

“It was only a matter oftime that we
were rewarded for our efforts," said
Darryl Shepherd. “It seemed like we
had a stretch where we really had some
bad luck. But eventually things were
going to turn our way because we have
so much talent.”

Things also went Charles Smith’s
way for a change. The Panthers have
had trouble getting the ball to the 6-10
Smith much of the season. As a result,
he’s scoring only 14 points per game

Lady Panthers get backon winning track  

Kirk Bruce

in Big East play.

Against Connecticut, Smith scored a
game—high of 18 points while capitaliz-
ing on six of the nine shots from the
field.

“This game was for our con-
fidence,” said Smith. “That was the
main point of it.”

Both Chipman and his squad said
with conﬁdence that they believe Pitt
is capable of a, strong showing in the
Big East Tournament. In the past three

yea-rs that Pitt has been a member of
the conference, they have lost in the
opening round.

“There’s a lot we can do that we
haven’t done yet,” said Shepherd.
“We feel that all the teams in the Big
East are scared of us because they
know we have outstanding talent.”

“Who knowswhat can happen if we
start playing the way we can,” said

hipman. ‘

Connecticut head coach Dom Perno,
too, believes Pitt has the potential to
play with anyone in the Big East.

“This was a very emotional evening
for them,” Perno said. “They have as
much talent as anyone in the Big East.
They have the capability to beat

_ anyone. ‘But they lack consistency, that

has been their problem this season.”
Notes: Chipman returned Pitt’s ﬁve
seniors for the ﬁnal 2:09 of the game

and they promptly ran off a 10-2 spurt .

which included a breakaway dunk by
walk-on John Blanton.  If Providence
defeats Connecticut in the regular
season finale and Pitt loses at
Georgetown, the Panthers will face the
Hoyas in the ﬁrst round of the Big East
Tournament. If Pitt wins or Providence
loses. the Panthers will battle arch-rival
Villanova  Freshman guard Phil
Gamble led Connecticut with 17 points
 With four blocked shots against
Connecticut, Smith upped his season
total to 74, which breaks the single-
season record previously set by Mel
Bennett in the 1974-75 season.  All
Pitt’s seniors scored, but it took a line-
drive 22-footer by Matt Miklasevich
with just seconds remaining in the
game to do so.  Chipman, who is
retiring at the close of the season,
finished with a splendid 62-18 record
at the Fitzgerald Field House.

head coach Kirk Bruce. “We couldn’t
play any more under control than we
did tonight. Our kids made the ad-
justments we had to make almost to the
tee.”

The victory improved Pitt’s record
to 11-15, while Marshall, a Southern
Conference school, dropped to 17-10.

The Lady Panthers received their
typical strong play from guards Kim
Tirik and Kim Gannis, but Pitt’s most
valuable player in the game was

went on a 13-6 run to take a comfort-
able 23-17 lead.

Pitt tied the game at the 2:24 mark
on a rebound layup by Long, but once
again, Marshall came right back. The
Lady Herd outscored Pitt 6-2 giving
them a 33-29 lead at the half.

The pace of the game picked up in
the second half, as both teams came out
and proceeded to shoot very well. The
Lady Panthers trailed until the 10:18
mark when Tirik hit a 20-footer to give
Pitt a 51-50 lead.

Pitt could not establish a comfortable
margin and Marshall tied the game at
65-65 with 54 seconds left. The Lady
Panthers worked the ball inside to
Long, who was fouled by the Lady
Herd’s Jenny Leavitt with 32 seconds
remaining. Long calmly stepped to the

In overtime, the Lady Panthers took
the lead for good on a layup by center
Jenny Tyner. Tirik iced the game with
two _foul shots with two seconds
remaining.

The Lady Panthers won the game in
overtime with near perfect foul
shooting. Pitt converted seven of eight
foul shots in the extra session.

The Lady Panthers placed five
players in double ﬁgures in the game.
Tirik scored 22 points, Gannis and

Long had 14, Tyner hit for 13 points

and forward Sally Sheerer chipped in _ ’

with 10 points for Pitt.

Forward Karen Pelphrey, one of the
nation’s leading scorers, led Marshall

Stottlemyer had only one year of ex-
perience as an assistant coach before
being named the head coach in 1979.
His coaching duties have followed an
illustrious wrestling career that ended
in 1978, ﬁve years after his arrival, and
was named All-America three times.

Now seven years later, after suc-

Adams, Stottlemyer ﬁnally has his pro-
gram headed in the right direction.
Since being thrown into a lion’s den
with virtually no prior experience, Stot-
tlemyer has fought off the bad and is
‘now experiencing some of the good.
However, it hasn't been all that easy.

“When I stepped in,” said Stot-
tlemyer, “there was a lot of things to
be done. Recruiting was especially a
concern since they hadn’t really
recruited very much before I stepped
in.
“I don’t think good things are built
overnight,” he continued. “It wasn’t
easy to get things on the track we
wanted to travel on. There’s no pro-
gress without a struggle.”

The wrestlers on Stott1emyer’s Pan-
ther team have also had to grow and
mature with their coach. “We had to
mature with him," said four—year
starter John Hnath. “He’s now filling
[Adams’] shoes after a tough struggle.
You have to remember, this guy was
just thrown into a head coaching job.”

For a guy at the young age of 24 who
suddenly found himself at the head of
a major college wrestling program in
one of the nation’s toughest con-
ferences, it’s been a long struggle. That
struggle for Stottlemyer finally reached
a point of rewarding return this season
as his Panthers finished a long and
grueling year with a 9-3-2 dual meet
record. ' ’ ’

The season began back in November
with a clean sweep of Waynesburg
43-O. It ended this past "Saturday with
 double dual meet victory over visiting
opponents Franklin & l\/iarshall and
Millersville by the scores of 36-10 and
31-3 respectively. The start and finish
may have been easy. but the middle
part ofthe schedule certainly was not.
The Panthers finished 8-7 with four

whom they had lost to during last
season’s struggle.

The Pitt wrestlers finished at 2-3-1
in the EWL this year, and their only
three losses came against three of the
nation’s top 10 teams. The Panthers
were defeated by No. 4 Penn State
34-5, by No. 9 Bloomsburg 30-12 and

 

ceeding former head coach Dave.

wins and a tie against five opponents -

 andfreshnlan Pat Santoro ,'

Pitt’s two favorites this weekend at t WL wrestl-

 

ing championships: senior Kyle Nellis 

by No. . 3 ranked Clarion 27-12.
Despite the losses, Pitt gained the
respect of their conference rival giants.

“This team is coming on and getting
better each year," said Clarion coach
Robert Bubb.

Another EWL rival coach, Penn
State?s Rich Lorenzo, had this to say
about Stottlemyer’s Panthers: “This is
an improving team. It’s certainly a
credit to Rande [Stottlemyer] and his
program. They’ve worked extremely
hard to get where they are, and they’re
coming on strong." ‘

The Panthers did reach new heights
this season in more ways than one. The
Pittiwrestlers not only achieved their
best dual meet record in seven years,
but the tenacious Panthers also were
ranked as high as 19 in the nation for
several weeks. The match that really
catapulted Pitt to national recognition
was a 21-21 tie with Lehigh Universi-
ty, the then No. 9 team in the country.
Following Pitt’s hard-fought draw,
Lehigh coach Thad Turner had high
praise for the Panthers.

“I knew when Rande [Stottlemyer]
first took over.” said Turner, “that he
would get this team going, and he’s do-
ing that right now. I know it hasn’t

A been easy, but he has stuck right with

it through both the good and bad

times. ‘ ’

This year has been an enjoyable year
not only for the coach but for the team
members as well. Fifth-year senior
Doug l-Iaines returned for one more
season. and the starting 158 pounder
has seen a big difference.

“The team this year is a lot closer
than before." said 1-laines. “Everyone
pulls for each other now more than they
have in the past. It has a lot to do with
the younger guys not learning the
negatives, like in the past. This year
the guys are much more positive."

The record change of wins and losses
for the Panthers hasn’t occurred over-
night. Senior Joe Bond felt it was com-

 

 

 

ing in due time.

“I think it could have happened last
year,” remarked Bond. “But it was in-
evitable this season. Positive thinking
is now beginning to be transferred on
down to the younger guys. This pro-
gram is on the right track, and we’re
beginning to arrive on the national
scene.”

The coach, however, isn”t convinced
the team has arrived, and Stottlemyer
isn’t willing to take anything for
granted. He knows that it will take even
harder—working people for the Panthers
to keep making strides to the top.

“We haven’t really done enough
yet,” said Stottlemyer. “Not any one
good year means you’re there. It takes
several yearsof doing it again and
again.

“We are on the right track. and the
guys now have a positive attitude about
everything. It’s been a slow process
that we’ve worked at year after year. "

One guy who has had to mature and
adjust right along with his coach is
Hnath. "It's nice heingon a winning
team." Hnatli said. “There's now a
willingness by the whole team to put
forth the effort. Coach [Stottlemyer] is
now beginning to take this team in the
right direction. He now liar: the team
believing they can win. and it wasn‘t
like that before."

The Panthers still hm c far to go. and
the road is even l<iri_gci' to travel for
Stottlemyer and his team. No one
knows this better than the coacli
himself.

"We haven't arrived yet." said Stot-

-tlemyer. “We want to improve for next

year and every year after that. We’re
not going to just walk out there next
season and expect to win. We have to
work harder to go even further."

It seems for now this Panther team
is on the ‘right road. The team may not
have arrived just yet, but the brains
behind the brawn certainly has.

highlight for head coach Donna Sanft.
Pieters tried a double—back somersault

incredible that a 21-year-old senior can
learn it.“

Strong performances also came from
freshman Trish Aser on vault and floor,
Cathy Coleman on bars and Kim
Calderone on beam.

Sanft was pleased with her team’s
performance, although noting, “Each
week, we have a good meet but not a
great one. The mistakes on beam and

bars are mental mistakes.” She said the

gymnasts are being cautious during
competition and lack that “all-out, go-
for-it attitude  We’re working on get-
ting that atmosphere in workout.”

Senior Mark Klafter was once again

“Klafter did his usual excellent per-

Mike Lloyd. acting head Coach Satur-
day. “Matt had one of his best meets
although they hurt him on high bar
bccausc thejudges felt he missed a re-

about the meet. “I think we can go out

Victory renews NCAA hopes

By John Enright
Staff Writer

Monday night’s Panther win over the
Connecticut Huskies was just what the
doctor ordered for a struggling Pitt
squad that had lost six of its previous
seven games.

Sophomore forward Charles Smith
was pleased with the win. “I felt good
about the game. I did what I had to do
and I helped the team the best way I
can.” said Smith. “All in all, it was

a game for the whole ball club.”

Going into the Connecticut game,
Pitt had last four Big East games in a
row and Smith was beginning to
receive a good deal of criticism because
his scoring production was down. Of
course, the criticism is only natural
when you’re' the star player on the
team. .

Smith, who scored 18 points and
grabbed 10 rebounds against the
Huskies, disagreed with this theory. “I
don’t feel I’ve been struggling. I’ve
been playing pretty well. I’ve only been
taking about eight shots a game,” com-
mented Smith in reference to his scor-
ing drop—off.

Junior guard Curtis Aiken, who set

a personal high with 10 assists, was
especially happy for the seniors. “My
attitude going into the game was not to
worry about scoring points, but getting
as many assists as I could because it
was the seniors’ last [home] game. I’m
glad all the seniors scored,” said
Aiken. —

Indeed, all I ﬁve Panther seniors
scored in the contest. Keith Armstrong
and Joey David scored in the first half,
while Darryl Shepherd, John Blanton
and Matt Miklasevich got their points
in the second half.

Blanton made a two-handed power
dunk with 27 seconds left and
Miklasevich hit a jumper near the
buzzer, bringing a quiet crowd to its
feet for the first time all night.

Roy Chipman, the Panthers’ lame-
duck coach, didn’t want to get involved
in all the fanfare of Pitt’s last home
game of the season. “They wanted me
to get involved with the Senior Night
and I really didn’t want anything to do
with it,” said Chipman. “If we don't
do well in the tournament, I don't want
to use that [the last home game] as an
excuse.”

The Panthers close out the regular
season Saturday afternoon against the
Georgetown Hoyas in Landover, Md.

getown

A win is almost essential if the Panthers
have thoughts of playing in the NCAA
Tournament. The players are confident
they can do the job.

‘ ‘We beat them once already [80-76
on Jan. 2] and know we have some
momentum," said sophomore forward
Demetreus Gore. “We have to go
down there and work hard.”

“Everybody knows we can play
[with Georgetown],” added Smith.
“But we have to handle their
pressure.”

The Connecticut game was a big win

for the Panthers, but they still need at.

least two wins to receive an at-large bid
to the NCAA Tournament. Pitt, cur-
rently 15-ll, was seeded 12th in the
Midwest Regional last season with a
17-11 record. _

Because there are 64 teams in the
tournament, Pitt’s 12th seed meant that

16 teams were seeded, or picked, -

below the_Panthers in the selection
process. This is a different season, yet
it would not be surprising to see Pitt
receive one of the last at-large bids if
they win two more games this season.

An upset win over Georgetown on
Saturday would ease the pressure the
Panthers will have on their shoulders
in the Big East tournament.

A Pitt’s Keith Armstrong will be looked to for added strength inside this weekend

against Georgetown.

Klafter wins in and out of gym

By Shelly Ranus
For The Pitt News"

In a time when missed classes and
treading-water QPAs are com-
monplace, he is unique — an athlete
who has excelled both in the gym and
in the classroom.

For Mark Klafter, being a student at
the University of Pittsburgh is just as
important as being a member of the Pitt
men’s gyrrmastics team. To be success-
ful in both areas takes perseverance and
the ability to focus on long-term goals.

“The major message that I would
like to get across is thatl am a student
first and an athlete second,” Klafter
said. “It is very possible to do both
successfully if you focus on your
goals.” I

Klafter’s goal is indeed a lofty one..

At this time next year, he plans on
spending his afternoons in a laboratory
studying with other first-year medical
school students instead of practicing in
a gym. He has been accepted to the
University of New England Medical
School, something of which he is
justifiably proud.

“I think my greatest achievement has
been getting accepted into medical
school,” said the senior from Smith-
town, N.Y. “My main philosophy has
been to devote all my energies to what
I am doing at the time. If I’m study-
ing, then I focus on studying; if I’m in
the gym, I work hard on my routines.”

This summer his successes continued
in international competition. As a result
of his 22nd—place finish in the NCAAS

last year, Klafter was chosen to com-
pete on the U.S. International Team at
the Maccabiah Games. He brought
home many memories and two silver
medals. -' ’

“The major thing that I got out of
the Maccabiah Games, in addition to

' the excellent competition, was a sense

of comradery with other athletes,”

of friendship and support — it is
something that he has always gotten
from his family.

“My family has always been very
supportive,” Klafter said. “But the
greatest inﬂuence in my life has been
my father. He has always given me
confidence and tells me what I need to
improve upon.

“We are a close family and yet are
very independent. We all had different
goals and thus, very different out-
comes. My two sisters are working in
very different careers, but we are sup-
portive of each other and the goals that
we each have established.”

As Klafter prepares for his final
season in the blue-and-gold, he has a

of where we came from, we were all complish, Improving upon his per-

. HAPPY 215"" Klafter is familiar with that feeling team gain national recognition are just

two of them.

“I want to do the best that I can this
year, especially on the ﬂoor and
rings,” Klafter said. “I don’t want to
make any predictions about Nationals,
I just want to improve on my perform-
ance from last year. If you work hard

on your short-term goals, then the long- ‘

term goals will follow.”
