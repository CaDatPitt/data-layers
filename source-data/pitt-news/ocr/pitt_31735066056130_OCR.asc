local crirne
By Matt Groff
Asst. News Editor
Pittsburgh mayoral candidate Kathy
Matta told Pitt students last night that
crime is the symp_tom of two issues:
economy and racism. I » »
“Oakland hasbeen left vulnerable
by police cutbacks,” ‘Matta said. “We-
need to take steps in Oakland for a

I more safe environment for college

students. We can’t have people study-
ing in fear.”

She promised to strengthen police I

protection in Oakland, a section of
Pittsburgh left understaffed since the

city’s switch from police precincts to

zones, according to the candidate.
Matta, along with Tom Smith, head

-of Republican Public’ Relations in.

Pennsylvania, addressed more than
70 College Republicans at their first
meeting of the semester. Pitt students
seemed hopeful about Matta’s
chances against Democrat Tom
Murphy in November’s mayoral elec-
tion. ' V
“I thought she had some really
good ideas, especially against crime,”
Jen Pagliamlo said. a

Matta said her initiatives aim to
improve both racial and economic
conditions in Pittsburgh;

“We need to re-evaluate. our whole

philosophy toward safety,” Matta
said. _

“Part of that is making an effort to

hire police leaders from the commu-
nity.” ,
She said if Murphy is elected,
Pittsburgh will continue as a city “run
by bureaucracy totally against busi-
ness.” '

“The city is on the verge of financial
disaster,” Matta said.

“Pittsburgh is entrenched in
bureaucratic democracy.‘ The politics

Support group assists non-traditional stuclerzts

By Krista Haag , B
'For The Pitt News I

After coming home from work, cooking
dinner, doing laundry and putting the
kids to bed, studying for a western civi-

lization midterm is probably the last thing

a person wants to do.

Students Over 50, a support group,
offers guidance for students over the age
of 30 who have similar concerns. ‘

The organization also tries to help the
students ease into the social aspect of col-
lege life.

One of the most common problems for
a student over 30 is learning to interact

with the younger students, accordingto
Shelly Roisen, an intern at Pitt’s
Counseling Center and counselor for
Students Over 30. _

“Social isolation is quite frequently a
concern for older students because they

are at a different developmental state of .

life,” Roisen said. “We will help them
learn to overcome this”.

Roisen said that Students Over 50
provides an arena for its members
to exchange ideas about coping skills
and share feelings about everyday con-
cerns

The confidential discussions are meant
to be supportive in nature. The group also

gives the students an opportunity to meet’

their fellow classmates. ~

_One of the issues the group talks about
is managing to keep time available for
studying and attending classes, while try-
ing to hold a job.

Some students also have families, which
makes balancing their schedules even
more difficult. Other concerns for the
group are learning the process of studying
and “getting back into the swing” of acad-
emic life, said Roisen.

The group also hopes to share ideas
about the financial aspects of being an
older student. '

Institute provides educationalforum for politicians, students

By Randy Knapick
Staﬂ Writer

Using its academic resources
to aid both politicians in form-
ing their policies and students
in gaining first—hand experience
in governmental relations, the
University of Pittsburgh’s
Institute of Politics provides an
educational forum for the com-
munity.

By providing an “educational
function for the community,”
the institute aims “to help poli-
cy-makers make better

informed decisions,” according

« n . . . . - - . ; .-

to Director of the Institute
Morton Coleman.

Critical issues facing policy-
makers in Western Pennsylvania
are identified by the institute’s
board of fellows," which
includes people
Pittsburgh Mayor Sophie
Masloff, Council President Jack
Wagner, Board of
Commissioners Chairperson
Tom Foerster, State Rep. Tom
Murphy and State Treasurer
Catherine Baker Knoll.

The Institute of Politics then
gathers background information
on these issues‘ and increases

such as"

policy-makers’ awareness of the
issues through publications,
speakers, workshops, seminars
or forums, Coleman said.
Forums are face—to-face dis-
cussions between university
scholars, who have with exper-

tise on the topic at hand, and‘

elected officials, community
representatives and other civic
leaders who must decide. policy
involving that particular topic.
In a recent forum on welfare
reform, Coleman moderated a
discussion between Professor
Charlotte Dunmore and Dr. Roy
Lubove of the university and

Sen. D. Michael Fisher, State
Rep. Joe Preston and State Rep.
Sara Steelman.

The discussion opened with a‘
presentation of the problems of
the current welfare system. With
the shortcomingsiof the present
system revealed, the discussion
next exploredupotential solu-
tions and alternatives to help
resolve the inefficiencies of wel-
fareand curb its mounting cost.

Though no clear solutions
emerged from the session, the
institute’s forum offered the offi-
cials an opportunity to
exchange ideas in an open,

non—partisan environment with
the input of university experts
on social welfare, Coleman said.
Other issues explored by the
institute include the Intermodal
Surface Transportation
Efficiency Act, taxes, land use,
hate crimes, economic develop-
ment and equitable school
funding. ~ '
Coleman also said that tran-
scripts of the forums are avail-

able for other decision-makers V

Sports Medicine Center offers
progmmfor /aiglo scboolers

By Brian Lehew
For The Pitt News

The University of Pittsburgh’s Center
for Sports Medicine has devoted
Saturday mornings this fall to treating
high school students for acute sports-
related injuries.

The clinic, held every Saturday from 9
a.m. to 11 a.m. through Nov. 13 at the
Center for Sports Medicine, was
designed to provide an avenue for the
student athletes to get swift medical
evaluation and care.

“In addition, the clinical team will pro-

A vide consultation and follow-ups to the

athletes’ coaches and trainers for a
quick, safe retum to the sport,” accord-
ing to the clinic’s medical director Dr.
David Stone.

The clinic staffs one doctor and
one trainer on Saturdays and contracts
additional trainers to work at each
school.

The center is contracted by each high
school to provide evaluation and
treatment to its athletes. In return, the
school receives approximately 60 per-
cent in savings on medical evaluation
costs.

Since all splinting, casting and other

types of specialized care can be done
right at the clinic, the schools are also
able to avoid the extra costs of emer-
gency-care facilities and the athletes
receive quicker treatment.

Non—contracted schools may also use
the clinic, however, the cost is slightly
higher for the initial evaluation of the
injury.

Along with most of the City’s high
schools, Robert Morris College and Point
Park College are participating in the pro—
gram.

In addition to care at the clinic on
Saturdays, the program also sends train-
ers out to each of the school’s sporting
events to provide immediate care to
injured athletes.

Although the clinic is held during the
injury—laden football season when most
injuries occur, it is geared towards more
than just football.

“The clinic will evaluate injuries from
any sport,” Stone said.

_ South Hill Sports Medicine and St.
Margaret’s Memorial are among other
area hospitals providing similar pro—
grams.

However, Pitt’s is the largest, Con-
tracting around 30 high schools and col-
leges. I

Library system
to shut down

By Sam Gresock
Staff Writer

Students who do research using the
PITTCAT library catalog system will not be
able to do so this Saturday. A

PITTCAT contains a list of holdings at all
five University of Pittsburgh campus
libraries along with several other reference
databases. The system will be shut down
Saturday, Oct. 2, while it undergoes a soft-
ware upgrade. .

Tim Deliyanmides, head of automated ser-
vices for the University of Pittsburgh library
system, said users of_the system should not
be alarmed by the changes. “There won’t be
much that our users will notice,”
Deliyanmides said. “However, it will pave
the way for us to implement some changes.”

Deliyanmides said the upgrade, which is
paid for by PITTCAT’s annual maintenance
fee and has “no real cost,” will allow Pitt’s
library staff to process materials more quick-
ly. According to Deliyanmides, approxi-
mately 200,000 reference searches are made
each month using PITT CAT.

Student Government Board member Tom
Grassia said he will be ‘discussing plans to
notify students before PITT CAT’s_ one—day
shutdown with fellow board member Tony
Moody. Grassia advised students, “Get your
papers done before Saturday if you need to
use PITTCAT for research.”

 Writing best-sellers not unusual for Pitt

By Hillary Scott

For The Pitt News

A copy of international history
Professor Donald Goldstein’s
philosophy of teaching hangs
directly outside the door of his
office. Sounding much more like
an oath than a philosophy, it lists
12 rules that he tries to teach by.

Two of these rules include:

' number seven, “After a student
has completed my course, I am
more than willing to write letters
of recommendations,” and num-
ber nine, “Above all, I try to be
fair, accessible and to listen.”

Inside his office Goldstein sits
behind his desk with an unlit
cigar hanging from his lips.
Because he doesn’t smoke, he
said he gets great pleasure _just
chewing on it.

He is also wearing a yellow
sweater that he purposely took
time out before the interview to
put on. This sweater is supposed
to bring good luck to him and all
that know him, according to the
professor.

Goldstein said teaching-at a
university had always been a
goal of his. “\X7hen I was a little
boy I always wanted to be a pro-
fessor. I came about it in a long
way, though.” The “long way”
included serving in the Air Force
ROTC as well as in the Air Force
during the Korean War.

The walls_of his office are cov-
ered with pictures of his old
track days and old Air Force
buddies. His bookshelves, which
extend just about from the ﬂoor

to the ceiling, contain many
books on World War II, many of
which he has written.

Goldstein said his biggest
accomplishment was assisting in
the writing of a documentary
with David Brinkley entitled,

Pearl Harbor: Tbe Two Hours  

That Changed The World. “It
aired in 1991 and won the
Peabody award for best journal-
isni—in 1992.‘ Over 17 million
people watched it,” he said.

Another highlight in
Goldstein’s career was having
some of his books on top of the
best-seller list for months.
, At Dawn We Slept, the Untold
Story OfP€6l7'/ Harbor was on the
best—selling list in 1982 for 47
weeks. “It was number three.
That was the highest it ever got,”
Goldstein said with a smile. The
Miracle at Midway, a book
about the battle at Midway, was
on the best—selling list for seven
weeks, according to Goldstein.

Goldstein is continuing with
his writing. He said he is now in
the process of writing a book on
D—Day which will be out in
about four months. Another pro-
ject filling Goldstein’s time is
writing a book about Amelia
Earhart. _

But his endeavors haven’t

‘ been limited to the shores of this

country. Last spring Goldstein
went on Semester at Sea, which
gave him the opportunityto visit
10 countries including India and
Kenya. “They have been after
me [to go] for about 10 years. I

didn’t want to go because you

As welljas assisting local
politicians, - the institute aims to
benefit ‘ Pitt students _ by giving
them a ha'ncls—on part of politi-

.-cal activity.
' Ann I Dykstra - of
‘Commonwealth Relations

explained the “twofold thrust”
for establishing an internship

program within the Institute of f

’Politi'cs. j g

The internship‘ allows more
student interaction with elected
officials in the region. This
‘merger of academia and politics
“meshed very nicely with the

~ mission of the institute,” Dykstra

said. ,

Dykstra said the program’s
attempt to involve students
other than the traditional politi-
-cal science majors makes it
unique among internship pro-
grams. T

“We encourage students to
bring their own disciplinary
baggage, to View the political
process through the lens of their
discipline,” she said. About half
of past interns have come from
non-political majors, such as
sociology, biology and geology.
' “We seek to involve students
from all majors,” Dykstra said.
“Knowing about one’s govern-
ment, knowing about the politi-
cal process and learning how
policy works are things every-
body should know.”

The institute also provides “an
interdisciplinary avenue for offi-
cials to tap into university
resources.” This broad ‘scope
also coincides with the intern-

ship..PI0grarn’s_ goal to involve '

_ sor
'‘ Thursday nights. In additionthe ”
1 interns keep 'a'jou'rnalland’ write

students from a variety of disci-
plines. ' '
The internships are available

to juniors and seniors, and_
‘» interns must work at least nine

hours per week with their spon- ‘
and attend ‘seminars

a series of papers on their expe-
riences. _
Though f‘a bit more rigid”,

‘ than other internships, . Dykstra

said that the extra requirements
add a very solid academic foun-
dation to the “experimental”

A knowledge gained from the
- internship itself. “We have a lot:

of fun,” she said.-

lished in 1987, uses no universi-
ty -funds. “All money comes

the decision to live on the SS’:

“I’m. glad I went."I had a good
time. It’s a program that will

Goldstein said. “I also realized,
my God, that we’re a great coun-

we’ve got it. I’m living in the best

Goldstein said it is well worth-

the money. “We’re talking

Yet, you’ll never be able to sail

are entirely too many abortions performed inthis coun-
try. His reform package includes expanded family plan-

ning services to help prevent the need for abortions as

much as possible-. ,

 However, under the plan doctors and hospitals
opposed to abortion will have the option not to offer
those ‘kinds’of' services.  Clinton put it, hospi-
tals and doctors “who do not wish to in any way con-
done or participate” in abortion services would l1ave,__“a

conscience exemption.”  Americans opposed}?   
to abortion can receive tliielir health—related services    ~

from those who refuse to-offer it. J .

more jobs to Asian countries than we’ll ever lose

to home in East and Southeast Asia. Japan and

for the creation of a Palestinian state to be imple-

lived in Palestine. The
Palestinians rejected it.

In 1948 the United Nations voted
to approve the Partition Plan,
which called for the creation of

and peace reign, I can’t say that I

-am not apprehensive about the

proposal. I would really like to think that Yasser
Arafat is a terrorist-tumed-peacemaker, but it’s a

' little hard to swallow. How quickly we forget

who was behind the slaying of 11 Israeli athletes
at the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich.

Israel has much more to lose than the
Palestinians do. The Palestinians have had the
opportunity to have much more than they are to
get with this newly signed agreement. Ehud

C Sprinzak, a renowned Israeli political scientist,

has referred to this as a march of folly.
In 1939 the British, who controlled what was

both a Jewish and Palestinian
state. The Jews approved even
though their state would be very small. The
Palestinians did not.

Israel has had to fight several wars since -then,
all of which the Palestinians took part in. Many
Jewish graves have been filled by Palestinians.
But Israel is willing to slice up their already
peanut-sized country to give the Palestinians
another chance. I’m counting on the Palestinians
to capitalize on this opportunity, because if they
don’t, it will probably be their last.

It was an act so horrible that at gifted science

performing over 700 of these abortions. The D&X
is so similar to infanticide that when a college
student observed Haskell perform a D&X abor-

tion in 1989, the reaction was to call the police.
The July 5, 1995, edition of American Medical
News, published by the pro-abortion American
Medical Association, contains an investigative
report on the D&X procedure. American Medical
News interviewed Dr. Haskell and Dr. James
a McMahon, who also specializes

in D&X abortions. Dr.
McMahon admitted doing abor-
tions through 4O weeks, which
are full-term pregnancies.‘ Dr.
Haskell and Dr. McMahon told
American Medical News that

abortion should feel some relief.
Dr. Martin Haskell, a Cincinnati abortionist, has
developed a new technique that will ensure that

‘no child will survive anabortion. Haskell calls
. the procedure the D&X, which is to be distin-

guished from the traditional D&E method. The
D&X procedure differs from the D&E in that -the
unborn child is removed intact, rather than being
dismembered in the uterus.

A D&X abortion is carried out in the following-

way: guided by ultrasound, the abortionist reach-
es inside the mother’s womb with forceps and
grabs the baby’s leg. Next, the baby’s leg is

pulled out into the birth canal. .

Then the aboitionist delivers the child’s entire

A body except for the head. At this point in the pro-
» . cedure, the child is alive.

The entire bodyis outside the mother’s womb

"except for the head. Next comes the step that

Haskell calls “fetal skull decompression.”

The abortionist jams a pair of surgical scissors
into “the base of the baby’s skull. The scissors are
then opened to enlarge the hole. Then the scis-
sors are removed and a suction catheter is insert-
ed. The child’s brains are sucked out. Finally, the
baby is delivered, dead. 9 9

In his medical paper that was presented in _

1992 at the National Abortion Federation Risk
Management Seminar,.Dr. Haskell bragged of

iMos't first—year students manage your money in college

‘ the majority of babies aborted
with the D&X procedure are alive until the end of
the procedure. (When they stab the baby through
the base of the skull with surgical scissors.)
Haskell further explained to the Dayton Daily
News (Dec. 10, 1989), “When I do the instrumen-
tation onto the skull  it destroys the brain tissue
sufficiently so that even if it [the fetus] falls out at
that point, it’s definitely not alive.” “
The h_orror of both the Ana Rosa Rodriguez

story and the D&X technique is so great that one _

would think that no civilized human being could
condone it. Yet pro-abortion groups bathe in the
blood of this horror as they try to push the. so-
called Freedom of Choice Act into, law. FOCA
would force all 50 states to allow abortions on
demand, even for sex selection, even in the ﬁnal
months of pregnancy. .
Under FOCA, the D&X procedure will ﬂourish
and the abortionist who maimed Ana Rosa

Rodriguez would have been exempt froln legal '

punishment.

How can a nation, whose Constitution guaran-
tees the right to life and whose declaration states
that “all men are created equal” (not “equal after
birth”, but “created equal”),_ allow such a bill as
FOCA to get as far as it has? —

The media presents a
biased and unfair version of

forum, however, the doc-
trine is guilty until proven

, received a gift two weeks ago.

This gift was a box containing
samples of soap, shampoo, etc.

i _I In the box, besides the

deodorant and other goodies,
was a‘ newspaper called The
National College Magazine.

I opened this newspaper
determined to read its “college
guide” and was
shocked at the warped viewsiof
some of the articles in this so-

.- called newspaper.

Let me say that some of the
articles were actually informa-
tive and helpful. For example,
there were articles on student
diversity on campus, how to

and dealing with college life in
general. But one article caught
my attention and made me
quite angry. ‘

The ‘article, entitled “The ins
and outs of being a freshman,”
was written by Molly Williams
from the University of
Delaware. Ms. Williamswrites
about fitting in as a first-year
student and being cool. She
wrote about how people should
be trendy robots, conforming to
standards of “coolness.”

Some of her asinine com-
ments included, “Disco is way
in, and if you fail to realize that,
you are living in denial  musi-

you might think about a person,
so if you plan to makethe right
impression  anything [not con-

sidered cool] must be tossed 
championing nuclear prolifera-
tion would not be advisable, but
supporting any other cause is
highly recommended.”

Now some people may think
I’m crazy for harping about

Keep an open mind, dare to exist, and remain an individual

these few lines, but I was
brought up to believe that “I’m
okay, you’re okay.” By that I
mean that being yourself is
cool. You don’t have to con-
form to the trendy, or any other
group for that matter, to be
popular or liked — just be your-
self.

And what happened to listen-
ingto music because it sounded
good’ Music can say something
about you, but only if you let it!

You don’t have to interpret

everything, that’s what a term
paper is for!

And that bit about nuclear
proliferation, well not everyone
is a liberal. I’m not, for example,

and I get offended when some"

one says that a particular vievs
should not be supportec
because it isn’t cool. Again, sup-
port what you want, if yot
want. Dare to exist, I say!

Now Ms. Williams does enc
the article by saying that “indi-
viduality is in and intolerance is
out.” But putting it at the end ol
the article, and only barely men-
tioning it, is wrong.

So my message to you Pit‘
students is, be yourself, be
open—minded and exist! And i
mean it!!!

Getting the job done right at Louisville

Schnellenberger, alums, city umﬁz to ta/ee Cardinals’ football to new heights)

By Cory Walborn
Senior staff Writer

Listening to Howard Schnellenberger and
Johnny Majors speak yesterday, it was
impossible not to tell the obvious differ-
ence.

Was it Schne1lenberger’s grandpa-sound-
ing, deep gruff? No. » ‘

Was it Majors’ light, Southern twang? Not
quite.

It was something else —- something
more important thanvoices. ' .-

Try, training fac.ilities, football atmos-

' phere, more facilities, stadiums, more facil-

ities and everyday working conditions that
drastically divide the Louisville and Pitt
football programs.

One program on the way up and the
other stilllooking for a way to respectabili-
ty“The last nine years are what you should
expect in a developing program,”
Schnellenberger said of his Louisville

tenure at Pitt’s weekly press conference’

yesterday. “[In the past] there has been

peaks and valleys. Hopefully now it will
only be waves.” '

With a 4-0 start (its best in 21 years) and
a top—20 ranking, the Cardinals seem to be
approaching a less choppy ocean.

“In 1985 we had the worst football pro-
gram‘ in America, and we have statistics to
prove it,” Schnellenberger added. “Now we
are 18th or 19th in the nation.”

Was Louisville’s strong program the mir-
acle workof Schnellenberger?

A coach who built the University ..of
Miami toa national powerhouse in the
early 1980s and won the national champi-
onship with the Hurricanes in 1983?”

Or was it more than that? e
' “The citylof Louisville gave us the man-
date to move ahead,” Schnellenberger said.
“The future looks bright. The university
will ‘announce this Friday the go-ahead for
our new stadium. It will give us more fans
to cheer for Louisville.”

About 50,000 to be exact.

The awesome looking schematic of the
future Cardinals’ Stadium, with two huge
levels of stands, is a sure sign of the

progress Louisville has made.

“The fact that ours will be the newest
on-campus stadium inthe country gives us
the ‘opportunity to have state-of-the-art
facilities in every category,”
Schnellenberger said. “And that can help
us get ahead in recruiting, not just get
even.” ' I

And if you don’t believe the Cardinal
program is serious about its future, the title
of its. football media guide says it all,
“Building The Traditions of Tomorrow.”

While Pitt can’t build traditions right
away, Panther head coachjohnny Majors
just wants Pitt to build something.

“We need improvement in weight rooms,

_training rooms and academic facilities,”

Majors said. “Whatever is best for the ath-
lete to work in, train in and study in.”

When Majors left Pitt in 1977, the facili- ‘

ties the Panthers had were so_me of the
best in the nation. ‘

But 16 years later, the facilities, that wel-
comed Majors back were no different than
when he had left. V »

was on intensity.

“[Against Kansas] we weren’t
in it emotionally. [It is] extreme-
ly frustrating,” Lucanie said.
“No one likes to lose. We
know we’re doing it. It’s just a
matter of someone coming out
and saying, ‘Look, you guys are

‘all clueless, but I’m going to go

dropped the third game and

Brett, R an farewell

mar/es ast of dying
breed in baseball

I guess it started earlier in the
year, back when the summer
still held promise and the pen-
nant races had not yet begun to
take shape.

After nearly three decadesin
the majors, White Sox’ catcher
Carlton Fisk’s career was over.

He broke Bob Boone’s career
games record for games caught,
and stoically if not quietly, took
his final steps off the playing
field and first steps to
Cooperstown. We all knew

beginning to understand some-
thing that harkens back to the
old theory that you don’t
appreciate it ‘til you lose it.
There are no more George
Bretts. '
There are no more Nolan

Hall Of‘ Famers Ozzie Smith,

executives and players.

Its such a
strange day to
' have all of these
great players on
the field at one
time, those who

things seem to be coming in
droves. »

Next Nolan Ryan left.

Now George Brett.

Ryan, the major league’s all-
time sgtrikeout leader, walked
off the field at Seattle’s
Kingdome Wednesday night to
a standing ovation after taking
himself out of the game. His
arm, after thousands of mitt-

- popping fastballs, had finally

given up, and his record-setting
career was over.

And Brett,’ baseballs’ sweetest
swing and oldest kid,
announced ata press confer-
ence Saturday that this season-
— a year in which he put up
numbers (.270 average, 17 HRS,
68 RBIs, as of Friday) that
would make most happy and
would get a lot in a new con-
tract + would be his last.

Time to move on.

“I have accomplished more
in my playing days than I ever
thought I would,’.’ Brett said at
a news conference. “The one
thing that I’m proud of most, *
and I say this sincerely, is
spending my whole career_ with
one team.” 8

This is a man that, when
asked how he would like his
career to end, said he would
like to be thrown out on a rou-
tine ground ball, hustling all
the way down the line, so the
younger players could see how
it is supposed to be done.

Brett’s wishes may just fall
on deaf ears, because, figura-
tively and literally, that’s not
the way that baseball is going.

Cross country squads go
one-for-two over Weekend;
men top three-team ﬁeld,
women tumble to Bucknell

Pitt's Nesko,

pace field as
Pitt men beat
Penn State,
Bucknell

By Keith Pompey
Staﬂ‘ Writer

This past weekend the
University of Pittsburgh’s
men’s cross country team
traveled to Bucknell
University and overpowered
Bucknell and Penn State
University in a three-way
meet. V

Sophomore sensation Mike
Umbleby and junior phenom
Frank Nesko led the way for
the Panthers.

With two miles to go,
Umbleby and Nesko man-
aged to separate themselves

from the pack and accom- V
plished the unheard of —"
crossing the finish line of the.

five-mile course with the
exact same time of 25 min-
utes and five seconds. . —

For a while, it looked like
it was going to be a tight
competition with the third
and fourth place finishes
going to Bucknell. -

But the Panthers prevailed
as senior Matt Lynn and

_ sophomores Matt Clarkson
. and Denise Kuntztook the

fifth, sixth and seventh posi-

33 points

‘tions, preserving the victory

while shutting out Penn State.

The scoring of this meet
followed the dual meet for-
mat in which the meet was
scored as two different races.

The scores read: University
of Pittsburgh — 21 points;
Bucknell University — 32
points. Pitt — 15 points;
Penn State University — 48
points. H ~

After two encounters, the
Panthers and Nittany Lions
were at a stand still with
both teams walking away
with a victory.

The Nittany Lions, who last
weekend outscored Pitt by
only four points to win the
Spike Shoe Invitational, were
without their top five run-
ners.

Despite being happy with
this weekend’s results,
Panthers head cross country
coach Jim Lear knows that
the next time Pitt meets up
with Penn State the score will
be a lot closer.

“Their top runners didn’t
run,” Lear said. _

‘-‘We were running. against
their B team. But overall, I
am pleased with the team’s
performance. I expected us
to win and we did.”

The Lady Panthers also‘

traveled to Bucknell over the
weekend to compete against
the Lady Bisons, but their
results~weren’t the same.
Bucknell outrnuscled Pitt by
seven points -— the Panthers’
opposed to

Bucknell’s 26.

For awhile it looked as if
this group of overachievers.
was on the way to its first
win of a young season.

Standout rookie Angie
Martin provided the spark of
the meet.

Martin ran away from the
pack on her way to winning
the 5.1-mile course with a
time of 18:45 — a 21-second
cushion ahead of Bucknell’s
J. Wilhelm, the second-place
finisher.

With a mile to go, sopho-
more Tonia Malloy overpow-
ered two of Bucknell’s finest
runners to obtain a third

place finish with a time of .
' 19:11. ' A .
Rookie Stephanie Ellsworth ,

finished in sixth place still
keeping the hope alive for a

victory, but Bucknell took the '

next four places, crushing
any hope of a Lady Panthers
victory.

“This is a good team,” Pitt
assistant coach Keisha Dumas
said

“Since they are very young,
they don’t know that much
about our team pride. Once

» they learn to have pride in '

their performance, we will be
a very good team.” '

coach Steve Bird, is but a layup
for the youngster.

“Up at [pre-season camp in]
Johnstown, [Pa.l, anything
inside of 45 yards he was 80
percent or better,” Bird said.
“And anything inside of 35 he

was 100 percent. And that was L

off grass.”

Despite his success in the
game against Virginia Tech, in
which he booted two field

goals, Kalmanides had a very’

inauspicious debut, missing the
first try of his career — a
lengthy attempt versus
Southe_rn Miss in the Panthers"
openen

“Everybody misses, but at
least I got the first miss out of
the way early,” he said. “I was
mad but forgot about it
because you have got to kick
some more.”

“The hold was a little off,”
Bird said. ‘

“It was-a little tilted, and he
hooked it. It had the distance
 ithad another 18 or 20 yards
on it  but he just hooked it.”

Kalmanides’ second kick was

blocked, and he didn’t hit his

first until the Panthers’ 63-21

loss to "Virginia Tech a week

later.

“That first kick was a confi-
dence builder  it felt good to
get the first one out of the
way,” he said. “The Virginia
Tech game gave me confidence
when I went out and hit two
field goals.” ,

“I asked him [after the kick] if
he was alright, and he said he
was fine,” Bird said of
-Kalmanides’ first three-pointer.

§‘ e was a little nervous, but
glee; he got that through, he
gwgis okay.”

 [Aside from handling the
plhcekicking, Kalmanides also
handles kickoffs —— an often
overlooked trade and one at

which he has struggled a bit.

Despite a high school "career
that included consistent kick-
offs into the end zone,
Kalmanides has not been reli-
able at getting the ball inside
the five.

“I’ve kind of been hampered
with a lower backsprain, but
that’s no excuse,” Kalmanides
said.

“I haven’t been hitting them
solid. It has to do a little with
the game [as opposed to being

"in practice], and I have to step

up a little.”
“I’m not worried about him,”

Bird said.

“He [kicked them in the end
zone] all the time in high
school. It’s the.first time he’s
kicked off turf, so it’s a little
new for him.

“He’s gonna be alright. He’s
trying too hard right now, but
as soon as he kicks the first
one out of the end zone  just

like his first field goal  he’ll

start doing it a lot.”

But_the question remains:
How far can he go?

Can he be the first great
Panther kicker?

Can he make it in the
National Football League?

“I don’t think about the NFL,”
Kalmanides said.

“I figure I’ve got a pretty
good shot. I’m starting as a
freshman. I have four years to
play, and I still have more
things to learn, like timing to
the ball, getting to the ball fast
and kicking every ball consis-
tently. I just want to make
every kick that I’m out there
for.”

“You don’t want to put that
type of pressure on a kid this
early  it’s too hard to say 
but he’s done a nice job with
his accuracy, and he seems to
be rather poised,” Sciullo said.

“He’s ‘one of the best we’ve ‘

ever handled,” Bird said. “This

How odd that a sport that
was invented for play by indi-
viduals, and where the out-
come of most tournaments
depends on the performance of
the contestant against himself
instead of head—to—head com-
bat, would produce a stunning
display of the importance of
teamwork and cooperation?

Another welcome" deletion
from this past weekend’s tele-
cast was commercials. Half the
normal amount of air time was
spent extolling the virtues of

auto makers and discount bro-
kerage "firms. Whether or—— not
that can be seen as a positive
depends heavily .on what fills
that extra broadcast time.

Instead of useless commentary '

or tips ‘ from the pro, we
received more coverage of
actual play. V _

Not only did the lack of com-
mercialism -- lend itself
stronger team emphasis, but
the structure of the Rydercom—

notion of team first, self second
that many players spoke of.

uses the seldom used match-
play concept. . '
In a match,-play competition,
teams or individuals fro_m both
sides compete against each
other on each hole. Instead of
an 18—hole stroke count being
kept, the winning side is deter-
.mined by the winner of each
hole. ‘
Also, by teaming players up
andusing the alternating shot
and four—ball, the Ryder Cup
shifts even more emphasis ._to
the team. ' A
While it may be hard to claim
an event held once every two
years as the crowning. example,-'

of the importance of team play;

the Ryder Cup presents‘: a
strong argument. The players
gain nothing but the honor of
representing their country to
the best of their ability.

Maybe, other sports should
take? a hard _' look‘ at A" _exac._t_"ly
whaitnthey are trying‘ to accom-
plish when competing’ on the
world stage (Dream Team?).l

Whatever ‘the case may be,
the United States finallygwon
on European soil for the first
time since 1981. After losing
the Cup at the Belfry in 1985

and failing to regain it there in
1989, the U.S. finally shook the
noose that was Sutton Coldfield
from its neck and reestablished
itself as possessing the best col-
lective golfers in the world.
