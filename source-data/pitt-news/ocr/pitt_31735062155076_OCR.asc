Doc Carlson  A Man To Remember

Man of Many Talents

By JIM 0’BRlEN

It was Thursday and Doc Carlson was fussing about
his sometime office in Fitzgerald Field House.

Doc Wasn’t really supposed to be there. They had
retired him late this summer, and told him to take it easy.
It was like telling Mahatma Ghandi to go to war. The
desk and chair, scale and stethescope would always be
there. No one had the heart to take them away for they

knew Doc would always return another day.

He called to me in the hall, and soon I was in his office, and it
didn’t take Doc long to go off on a tangent. This time it concerned
the footwork necessary to achieve balance when you're running with
a football. There he was $1 white-haired man of 70, a little less nimble
than Astaire, but shifty enough to elude an open drawer at the bottoni
of his desk.

He explained the mechanics of a wide base, the-muscles involved,
mentioned something about the center of gravity. I guess I was doing
some footwork of my own at the time—-backward, I was too busy this
day. Anyhow I seldom understood these lessons in kiniesiology.

It was Friday and I wasn't too busy. I was playing some foot-
ball on the lawn in front of the Student Union. Strictly for kicks.
'1‘l1en my man man threw a pass my way and I caught it and fell.
An unexpected “Hurrah!” went up from the sideline and when I
looked it was Doc Carlson, walking along Fifth Avenue in the afternoon.
“It’s a good thing you caught that ball, Sourpuss," he cried. “You'd a
caught it good from me.” He smiled. And suddenly that catch was a’
Rose Bowl catch that broke Ohio State's back.

It was Saturday and Doc had gone to his other home. In Ligonier,
his idea of paradise, out where he planted things, like ﬂowers and
fruit trees. Imagine planting a tree when you're 70. But Doc was a
stubborn man. You remember him telling you last winter about his
wife ordering him to go out and get a new topcoat. “Bah,” he said.
“You don't buy a topcoat at my age.”

So he went and bought two topcoats, a suit, a pair of shoes and
a new hat. “'I'hat’ll teach her,” he said, smiling.

It was Sunday and you woke up late, feeling ill from staying
out late. The phone rang. It was Beano Cook. All your mother heard
you say was “Doc Carlson” and “one-thirty,” but it was enough.
She knew. And then you felt worse.

 As Friend, Counselor,

Fault-Finder by Writer

(Continued on Page 2)

That afternoon you were in Fitzgerald Field House, next to Doc’s
office. And you felt a little better. And you had to go into his office.
The burgundy cover on his observation table was dusty and you could
streak it with your ﬁngers. The pillow at the top was the kind ﬁre-
men find when they're rooting through a flop house.

Maybe they were right when they said Carlson could no longer
doctor for the University. Perhaps his practice was outmoded. But he
found fault with his successor because “things are too regimented
now.” He recalled how anybody could come into his office for help,
the profs, the dishwasters in the cafeteria, the mechahic in the garage.

But Doc Carlson forgot that the'University where he lived for

A more than 50 years had grown up, gotten rich and sophisticated. He

didn’t consider how there were now a thousand or more students liv-
ing on campus these past few years, who hadn’t been there before.
There wasn’t time anymore to pull the thorn from the Landscapers
ﬁnger.

And he didn’t know the students’ hometowns anymore. It’s a
goold thing he didn’t. He used to say, “Hiya, Braddock!” and “Hiya,

A  ., Hazelwood!” when he didn’t know your name. It would sound awful
today if Doc had to call “Hiya, Jamaica Heights!” or “Hiya, Great

Neck!” There weren't any poor kids anymore who needed a few
bucks to replace their worn slacks.

But Doc Carlson was a healer. He could seize your heart with-
out a scalpel and sutures. And he could ease the pain. _I-Iis smile was
more quieting than barbiturates.

Perhaps he wasn’t a great surgeon. You remember how he once
burned a wart off your knuckle, and promised it wouldn’t return,
but it did. But you remember how it looked and smelled as he sent
sparks shooting into your knuckle, and you watched it scorch and
turn to charcoal and how it hurt like hell, and you remember how
you didn’t say a word because Doc was smiling and you couldn't
complain.

When you were down in the dumps, you wondered whether you
should speak to your priest or Doc Carlson. He’d smile and say, “Let
me buy you an ice cream cone,” and you felt much better.

You remember him calling you into his oﬁice, and telling you
to reach into his drawer where there were all sorts of candies and
chocolate bars. There are probably ﬁle cards there now in his old
desk. .

Doc used to write you little notes now and then. They were al-
ways encouraging. He wanted you to be more compassionate in your’
Writing. There were too many good guys in this world, he argued,
to bother criticizing the bad ones.

There's a book in your library that Doc sent you. It’s called The
Tumult and the Shouting. It’s a collection of stories by Grantland
Rice, the dean. of American sportswriters in Doc’s days. It doesn't
belong on that shelf with Tolstoy, James and Twain, but Doc thought
it did, so it stays.

Inside the cover there's a message and a diagram—-of course-—
from Doc Carlson. There’s an arrow pointing upward toward “Grant-

eland Rice (C0mP3SSi0!1)” and an arrow pointing downward toward

“Westbrook Pegler (sarcasm)” and the footnote read: “the choice
is yours.”

He wanted me to See the good in everyone. Robert Louis Steven-
son once wrote:”“There is no duty we underrate so much as the duty
°f  haPP3'- That's. why Doc Carlson is underrated. Try to over-
look his achievements in sports, his plaques, and trophies. Look in-
stead at the man. ‘

Pe0Dle who generate inner sunshine make life pleasanter for

= those around them. Their impulses lead to right action; their thoughts

are usually true. They have their roots in some deep, shining faith.
Very naturally we all resent those tiresome Polyannas who foist
their cheerfulness upon us regardless of our fate and feelings. But
Doc Carlson found pleasure in a sunset or the face of a friend at
the door and he felt that his daily du'ty was happiness.
Doc Carlson gave out gaiety and he felt it coming back at him.

‘ " It was like a boomerang—a blessed boomerang. He got a high rate

of return. He often spoke of the “dividends one receives.”
I didn’t like the way he went away, but I’ll bet there was a gentle

, smild dancing at the corner of his mouth. He didn’t even tip us off

with a cough or a cry. He didn’t want any fuss.He probably entered

Mlaughing.

Relief of Parking Mess

By VICKI EPSIEIN
Students complaining about the difficulty of parking
their cars near campus may receive relief, according to
City Traffic Engineer, Anthony Miscimarra. Miscimarra

_purports to be pursuing adjustment and cost-reduction of

parking to meet the needs of the area. After installation of
the parking meters, to be ﬁnished about November 20, the
city will try to “establish as much parking in the Oakland area as pos-
sible,” he explained. _ . -
Mostof the streets in the campus area are 28 feet wide and cars
parked there would take up 14 feet, or half this space, Miscimarra

claimed. Parkman, Lytton, Ruskin, Tennyson and other avenues,

around the campus presently provide no parking, restricted hours, or
one-side-of-street parking. Miscimarra considers parking a possibility
there if the streets are one-way; but he plans to wait and observe
the situation for a few months after the meters are installed before
taking action. ’

In addition to these, larger streets like Bigelow and Fifth Ave-
nue, with two hour meters, may get eight hour time limits at reduced
rates, Miscimarra indicated. The change, however, would only be
possible if these spaces were often vacant and did not, as two hour
meters, meet the needs of the drivers.

Miscimarra aims for 95 per cent occupancy of parking spaces
and at having a spot for each person who wants one. He refuses to
promise all-day parking, however, for he claims that downtown mer-
chants, students and employees of the University leave their cars in
Oakland all day. He expects to make meter space available, though.

The safety factors to be considered in adjusting parking include,
according to Miscimarra, activities in the Oakland area, ﬁre hazards
and the volume of traffic. ‘

For the student seeking low cost parking, a few private lots are
available at a monthly rate of $30.00.

EVIGWS.
By NANCY DELANEY

The Poet and his Fian-
cee are in love, blissful, ro-
mantic love, replete with
doves and daisies and eider-
downs. Raymond Peynet’s engag-
ing cartoons, collected in The
Lover’s Library (Grosset and
Dunlap, $3), spoof at their love;
the result, however, is not deri-
sion, but benediction. The Li-
brary consists of three separate
volumes: The Lover’s Bedside
Book, The Lover’s Week-end Book
and The Lover’s Keepsake Book.

Peynet depicts the Poet as a
tall, thin young man with long,
straight hair, who wears high
collars and a soup-bowl hat-—
and a look of innocent satisfac-
tion.

The Poet’s love for his Fian-
cee is simple and delicate. It’s
not their fault that they litter

At a party this weekend a masters’ candidate. in philosophy lashedoutat the

‘University administration for the impersonal atmosphere in the graduate schools. An

undergraduate, just as fast, spit back, How do you think they treat us?

Now this particular undergraduate happened to be quite active on campus and his
retort was the result of an actual conflict he had run into with the administration.
His anger was not so much that the administration's attitude was impersonal but that
they did not agree with his request-—too ﬁne a distinction to see in his answer but

quite a margin from the grad student’s statement when considering motivation.

For too many undergraduates, and graduate students as well, this school is

series of holes in an IBM card is nothing to scoff at.

terribly impersonal and the joke about being not even a number but a systematic

The University is indeed impersonal because these students have not found an
identity here, and since they cannot ﬁnd it, it must be the administration’s fault be-
cause they did not include it in the registration kit.

In part this is true. The University administration does not personally sponsor
identity-producing activities for students. But neither does it inhibit the students them-
selves from meeting this need.

L If these students ﬁnd this school impersonal, it is because they do not care about
themselves. For that identity is here, fought for by several far-seeing souls and sup-

_ ‘po3'ted by the unapathetic. It is not the stock identity of straight hair, jeans, and ma-
_ roon V-necks at Syracuse or that of independence at Antioch. One of the University's

greatest assets, it remains diversiﬁed and tolerant of innovation.

It remains only to be worked for.

. Only ifthese students use their backbone and commit themselves to an activity
or an interest group or go beyond assignments in an academic ﬁeld will they ﬁnd
this school. Only if they take a chance will they ﬁnd the personal and their own iden-

- tity. Not until then do they have the right to complain.

out for Langley Library. On
discovering it was closed, we
went on to investigate the
Cathedral libraries. Every

to the sixth floor was clos-

on. “Surely Scaife Hall li-
brary is open.” But we were
proven wrong again.

Finally footsore and

to read. Hall, but this time
“The Cruel War Is Raging”
was absent from the back-
ground. Replacing it was a
man arguing in German
while standing in the corri-
dor around the Commons
Room. I returned to my
room exhausted. Thy phys-
ical effort of finding a place
to study and trying to study
there was greater than the
mental effort actually in-

By Nancy Fuchs

I had managed to save from
being branded a “date
lounge.” Feeling secure

. from the eyes of any intrud-

ing male in the eleventh
floor hideaway, I donned a
bathrobe and ‘curled up in
a chair with my Primer of
Freudian Psychology. I was
congratulating myself on
ﬁnding’ a place to study
when in trouped a group of
men and women. “You aren't
trying to study are you?”
one asked. “We thought we
would practice our dance.
for the International Har-
vest Festival here.”

Clutching my robe and
glaring at the intruders, I
explained that I was indeed
trying to study and that the
lounge was off-limits to
men. They soon left, but by
that time I was so ﬁlled with
anxiety and frustration that
I probably would have made
a good case study for Hall.

SERIOUSLY THOUGH,
I think that there should be
at least one study area open
in the University outside the
dormitory, on at least one
weekend night. It is especial-
ly difficult to study in the
dorm with all the confusion
and there are not enough
desks in the lounge for eve-
ryone. Perhaps Schenley
Cafeteria could be open one
night as it is during final
exam week. Student Govern-
ment could be responsible
for running it as a study
hall with procbors to see that
noise is kept at a minimum.

It would provide students
with an incentive to make
the best use of weekend
study time and keep stu-
dents like me who can not
afford to waste the little
time they have from losing
all ambition. ‘

Winning football on a big-time scale is dead at Pitt
according to Syracuse football coach Ben Schwartzwalder.
No, Schwartzwalder does not think John Michelosen is an

incompetent or Chancellor Litchﬁeld is out to get football, _

but rather he feels that advanced educational steps at,

not only Pitt, but also Syracuse and Penn State spell trou-

ble for the presently successful football programs at these
-. the universities.

Schwartzwalder bases his predic-
tion of the eminent decline of win-
ning football at these three univers-
ities on the abandonment of red-
shirting. Red-shirting is the prac-
tice of holding a football player out
of competition one year, usually be-
tween his freshman and sophomore
seasons, so that he may gain experi-
ence and maturity.

Pitt, Penn State and Syracuse,
along with West Virginia, agreed
to abandon red-shirting three years

ago. Schwartzwalder does not ques-
tion the advantages or disadvantages of red-shirting but
says it is ridiculous for the three schools to schedule
teams which do red-shirt.
Schwartzwalder said, “I told our Chancellor we are
20 years ahead of the times.” _
THE LOSS OF red-shirting is ‘being felt at Pitt. Last
year four members of the starting line were red-shirts-—,
Ernie Borghetti, John Maczuzak,‘ Joe Kuzneski, and Ed
Adamchik. This year three red-shirts are playing regular-

- ly for the Panthers—Ray Pop, Paul Cercel, and Jim Irwin.

But how the absence of red-shirting is hurting the
Panthers this year can be best shown by the present senior
class—the first to be brought in under the no-red-shirts
standards. Only eight players out of 24 brought in in 1961
are playing to any extent this year. The remainder either
were not good enough or did not have time to develop.

An example of how red-shirting helps is the case of
Jock Beachler, current third-string center. Beachler was
brought in under ‘the new standards, but because of an
injury in his sophomore year he will be allowed to play
next season even though he is technically a senior this year.
Beachler has been of little aid this year, but next year
chances are strong that he will see plenty of action, and
may be a regular.

THE ARGUMENTS that many teams get by without
red-shirting hold no ground with Schwartzwalder. Navy,
Army, Notre Dame and the Big Ten schools do not red-
shirt and have been most successful in football. Schwartz-
walder showed how each case differs from that of Pitt,
Syracuse and Penn State.

He said that Army and Navy have everything their «

own way when it comes to recruiting. “There are special
rules for Army and Navy,” the Syracuse coach stated.
He cited the case of a fullback who began his collegiate
career at Holy Cross in 1961 and should be a senior this
year. He is currently on the freshman team at Navy, and,
according to Schwartzwalder, has three more years of
eligibility.

Schwartzwalder said, “This kid is really great too,
I've seen (Barry) McKnight and (Jim) Flannigan and
they’re both good, but believe me this kid would have no
trouble starting for Pitt next year.” He added that in-
stances like these and the prep school systems which Army
and Navy have enable them to get along without red-shirts.

NOTRE DAME IS another story according to Mr.
Schwartzwalder. “They get their pick of the best players
in the country. We can’t compete with them on a re-

cruiting basis and I don’t know of anyone that can. If _

Notre Dame really wants a boy they can usually get him.”

The Syracuse coach ‘says the Big Ten survives with-
out red-shirting because of the larger number of freshman
players they have. He claimed that Ohio State has over
100 freshman football players this year.

“Pitt, Syracuse and Penn State only bring in about
25 players a year,” Schwartzwalder said. “We can’t com-
pete against schools who bring in, upwards of 60 unless
we have the red-shirts.”

Schwartzwalder concluded his argument by saying
that he does not necessarily believe in red-shirting, but
added it is a must at his school, and at Pitt and Penn
State, if they are to continue to play winning football
on a big time level.

Editor, The Pitt News

The editorial and column con-
cerning the Navy game which
appeared on page 6 of last Mon-
day’s Pi-tt News were the most
ridiculous of a long series of
ridiculous football articles which
have appeared in this paper since
the beginning of the term.

We acknowledge that Fred Ma-
burek is a very good running
quarterback, but let’s not take
anything away from Kenny Lu-
cas, who is the best passing quar-
terback on the team.

Maybe coach Michelosen did
forget that Mazumk completed
ﬁve out of ten short passes but
maybe the “sportswriters” for-
got that he also had three of his
passes intercepted.

They also seemed to have left
out a few passing statistics where
it suited them. Namely, Lucas
completed three out of ﬁve pass-
es and had none intercepted.
These completions came at a
critical time and set us up for a
ﬁeld goal attempt.

The “sportswriters” also im-
plied that the only reason Mc-
Knight and Crabtree played
strong offensive games was be-
cause the defense was keying on
Mazurek. If they happened to be
at the game and saw McKnight
giving three, four, and even more
efforts to his runs—-with Mid-
shipmen hanging all over him-
they would have realized that no
defense in the nation could have
stopped him on Saturday, regard-
less of whom they were keying on.
Besides, would the defense still
key on Mazurek once McKnight
was given the ball?

The “sportswriters” also seem-
ed to think that the only person
who thought Staubach played a
great game was Navy coach
Wayne Hardin. Even the Pitt
fans will agree that Staubach is
a terriﬁc quarterback. The only
reason he was held on the ground
was not due to any lack of abil-
ity on his part but because the
whole Pitt defensive line played

which the paper also forgot to
mention. We should have a little
less criticism of individual play-
ers and a little more praise of
all the team.

Lastly, Mr. Zelkowitz has at-
tempted to predict the outcome
of ﬁve of the six Pitt games. We
could not ﬁnd the Navy predic-
tion and suspect that he thought
Navy would win and convenient-
ly forgot to mention it. The only
game he came near predicting
the winning team and score was
the William and Mary game
(which required a tremendous
amount of football knowledge).
If these predictions shed any
light on his understanding of the
game of football, we have wasted
our time writing this letter.

College Students Play Important Roles

 

In This Year’s Election Campaign

The 1964 election cam-
paign — a memorable one
in many respects—may well
go down in history as the
ﬁrst campaign in which
young people, particularly
college students, played a major
role.

Political leaders of both par-
ties, taking stock of their post-
election strengths and weakness-
es, are more than satisﬁed with
the support they received from
the younger generation.

Most signiﬁcantly, both Repub-
licans and Democrats are con-
vinced that they made a wise de-
cision in giving young people ex-
panded responsibilities beyond
the traditional chores of precinct
canvassing, telephone surveying
and leaﬂet distribution.

Throughout the campaign,
there was the unprecedented in-
volvement of the college-age chil-
dren of both Presidential candi-
dates — 17-year-old Luci Baines
Johnson and her sister, Lynda,
20, on the Democratic side, and
Barry Goldw.ater Jr., 26, and his
brother, Michael, 24, for the Re-
publicans.

“The young people are a new
dimension in politics that has to
be reckoned with,” said one prom-
inent politician. “I’m impressed
with their political know - how
and I don’t see how they could
help but win votes.”

During the campaign, a series
of youth and student organiza-
tions proliferated within both
parties. Under the umbrella group
of Young Americans for Gold-
water-Miller, the GOP had the
Young Republican National Fed-
eration, Youth for Goldwater-
Miller, Young Americans for
Freedom, Young Democrats for
Goldwater, and Young Indepen-

dents for Goldwater.
On the Democratic side, there

were the Young Democrats, Col-
lege Young Democrats, and Young
Citizens for Johnson. Both par-
ties were after the one million
college students eligible to vote
for the ﬁrst time in .a Presiden-
tial election.

The Democrats were so anxious
for the West Coast college vote
that they sent noted economist

John Kenneth Galbraith on a
ﬁve-day speaking tour of 12 cam-
puses from Los Angeles to Seat-
tle.

On other campuses, they used
other speakers, supplemented by
rallies and other vote-getting de-
vices, including the “ﬁrst voters
program” which called for pre-
sentation of a certiﬁcate signed
by the President to those who
registered for the ﬁrst time.

“I don’t know of .a single col-
lege where there wasn’t some
political activity on behalf of
President Johnson, except those
where the colleges don’t permit
on-campus political activity,” said
Eugene Theroux, an official of
Young Citizens for Johnson.

Theroux noted that Johnson
selected the University of Michi-
gan at Ann Arbor for his “great
society” speech which was to be-
come the keynote of the Demo-
cratic campaign. Follow-up cam-
pus speakers further developed
this theme.

“An unprecedented spirit of so-
cial concern has turned our stu-
dents in the 60’s much more con-
scious of their foreign and do-
mestic responsibilities and oppor-
tunities,” added Theroux. “Nat-

' urally, much of this carried over

to the campaign.”

More than 15,000 young people
turned out for a day-long youth
celebration at the Democratic Na-
tidnal Convention, marking the
ﬁrst time that a major segment

Also, on the Democratic side,
the Young Citizens were respon-

campaign innovations—the “LBJ

For the GOP, it was young
people, who worked tirelessly for
two years to advance Senator
Goldwater’s candidacy before he

actually declared his availability. '

And when Goldwater won the
‘GOP nomination he carried many
of these young people into Re-
publican National Committee
posts.

Last January, Goldwater said
that one of the major factors in
convincing him to run was the
enthusiasm and support gener-
ated among young people. As an
indication of his faith in the‘gen-
eration’s ability, he named 36-
year-old Dean Burch as Chair-
man of the Republican National
Committee.

THE RIDICULOUS RACE
IS VILLANOVA the second best team in the East? Does
any Ivy League football team deserve to be rated as high
as fourth in the East? Maybe you don’t think so,_but
according to the Lambert Trophy Committee, Villa-
nova excels the Panthers, Navy, Army, and Penn

State.

We would like to see just one of those teams on
the Wildcats schedule. Villanova would be lucky to
lose to Navy by thirty points. _

Ranking Villanova ahead of the Eastern powers is
like ranking Switzerland’s army ahead of Germany,
because it never lost a war.

The Panther football team is still hav-
ing its problems with a passing game. Both
quarterbacks could complete only 4 out of
13 passes against Syracuse. Barry Mc-
Knight couldn’t gain enough yards to make
up for the lack of passing and the Panthers
couldn’t get a sustained attack.

“Our passing game is a real problem,” said
coach John Michelosen. “We can't blame our lack
of an attack on any one thing, it has been a com-
bination of many things. One time our receivers
don’t get-clear, another time ouriblockers miss an
assignment, and also sometimes the quarterback can't

Causes Panther’s Problems

 
 
    

 

THE RECORDS of the Eastern teams this year indicate

that big-time college football is doomed in the East. 1963
might have been the East’s last big fling. Once in a
while, an Eastern team will uncover that rare com-
bination of intellect-and talent that makes an Eastern
collegiate football player, but that will be the excep-
tion, rather than the rule.

Perhaps one of the most glaring examples of the
inability to consistently combine brains‘ and brawn 1S
this year’s freshman team. The Panthers Were able
to recruit 26 players for this year’s team. Many
players that wanted to come to Pitt could not be-
cause of either poor grades or poor college boards.

Some of these students went to Kent State,
Whbse freshman squad is roughly three times the
size of Pitt’s. The Panthers were simply outclassed
and outmanned by the Kent State frosh, 50-20.

THERE JUST aren’t enough all-state football ‘players
and high school all-Americas in Western Pennsylvania

with high scholastic averages to ﬁll out the ranks of ’

a consistent bowl contender.

AFTER THE UCLA game, Eric Crabtree said he couldn’t

come back. ‘He was running with the second team when
Bill Bodle suffered his charleyhorse. Crabtree was
then moved back to the ﬁrst team. Since then, he has
been one of Pitt’s top offensive threats. He has shown
elusiveness as a runner, and sure-handedness as a
pass receiver. -

Crabtree’s blocking, however, is barely adequate.
But you can’t expect anyone to be perfect.

THE PANTHER DEFENSIVE tackles against Syracuse
made only one tackle. Jim Jones made the tackle. Bob
Guzinsky had no tackles and no assists.

These tackling statistics point up how much the
Panthers miss Ron Linaburg. Linaburg made eight
tackles in the UCLA game before he was injured. If
he can play this Saturday, Notre Dame might have
a rougher game than we now anticipate.

THE WORST BEA TING the Panthers have taken here
in recent years was in 1957 when Bud WilkinsoI_1’s Okla-
homa Sooners clobbered them, 26-0. This Saturday’s
game might be Worse. The Panthers tied Navy, 14-14.
Notre Dame defeated Navy, 40-0. The Panthers lost
to UCLA, 17-12. Notre Dame defeated UCLA, 24-0.

Frosh Booters End Season;
Defeat Fairmont State, 4-0

The Freshman soccer team posted a 3-2 mark for the
season as they downed Fairmont State College, 4-0, last
Saturday at Forbes Field. The victory gave coach Bob Mc-
Nulty his third consecutive winning season as frosh coach,
and an overall record of 13-2.

In compiling their record, the frosh defeated the

spot his receivers.”

Coach Michelosen tried to get an attack going
with a junk offense that was as “wide open” as pos-
sible. He had Mazurek at halfback with Lucas at
quarterback in an effort to loosen up the Syracuse

defense.

It was successful for one set of downs when the
Panthers scored their ﬁrst touchdown. "I can’t say
whether we win use that offense again or use Ma-
zurek at halfback,” explained coach Michelosen.

Two key players may be back in uniform for
the Notre Dame game Saturday. Bill Bodle, who has
had a mysterious ﬁngering charley horse, was up
at Trees practice ﬁeld rimning pass patterns, al-

though still favoring his leg.

Ron Linaburg was also on the practice field
with his ankle heavily taped. “I’m still not sure
V whether I can be ready,” said Linaburg.

Even if Linaburg plays he can't be in top shape
after a—month’s lay-off. Bernie LaQuinta, who played
only the ﬁrst half against Syracuse, was also out

for the greater part of the season. He was in the club
house the second half suffering from exhaustion.

Well-Balanced Like Maryland

Booters Await Akron Attack

When the soccer team
plays Akron University this
Saturday ‘at 10:30 a.m. at
Forbes Field, they face a
well-balanced and versatile
attack similar to Maryland.
Maryland outmaneuvered the
booters last Saturday, 6-3.-

Akron dominates the Ohio Col-
legi’ate Soccer Association as
Maryland dominates the Atlantic
Coast Conference. The Zips have
been in two NCAA playoffs and
have Won ﬁve conference titles in
the last six years. Last year they
downed the booters, 6-1.

Akron continues their domin-
ance over opponents this season,
compiling a 6-2 record to date,
while outscoring opposition 32-14.
The booters pose only a 4-3 mark,
and hold a slim 24-20 scoring
edge on opponents.

Akron keys its attack around
three men, just as Maryland did
last week. Linemen George Otie-

no and Udo Stillmayer and cen-
ter-halfback captain Neil Kocho-
sky all won honors as all-Ohio
and all-Nlidwest players last year.

Last week the booters couldn’t
stop Maryland center - forward
Eberhard Klein, and Otieno poses
.a similar problem. “Our offense
will be built around Otieno at
center-forward,” said Akron
coach Stu Parry. Otieno scored
eight goals as a freshman. last
year, and has been alternating
at inside right and center-for-
ward this year.-

Left inside Stillmayer com-
bines with Otieno giving the Zips
a powerful scoring potential on
the line. Stillmayer notched sev-
en goals last year.

Kochosky parallels Maryla'nd’s
Roy Eales in pacing the Akron
defense. Parry describes the 6’2”
175 "lb. center half as “the stal-
wart of our defense,” and he
compensates for the Zip’s loss of
star goalie Bruce Wilt. .

Despite A.kron’s lineup of tal-
ent,
“We’re a little more even with
Akron than Maryland. We learn-
ed from our game last week that
we've got to do more crossing,
switching, and long passing.”

Bemis respects the Zips, and
admits the booters will have a
tough assignment Saturday.
“We’ve got to keep their insides
covered. Otieno and Stillmayer
are good outside shots and we
can’t give them any room, Kocho-
sky is big and tough and we can't
play him head on. We'll have to
go around and behind him.”

Seven of Akron’s starters ‘are
lettermen. and Parry claims, “We

have depth on the bench.” Be- ‘

mis, however, says, “They've got
new’ personnel and will be hurt
by the loss of their top scorer
(Pete Millich). But they’re a
scrappy team and a bunch of
hustlers.”

01965‘

coach Leo Bemis says, -

Fairmont varsity, and the Slip-
pery Rock and Frostburg Junior
Varsities, while losing to the West
Virginia and Slippery Rock Jun-
ior Varsities. The outscored their
opponents, 10-5.

“The team looked real good
against Fairmont,” said McNulty.
“At the start of the season they
weren’t too conﬁdent, but in the
last two games they’ve jelled and
played consistent soccer.”

Joe Lee, inside left, opened the
frosh attack with three minutes
gone in the ﬁrst~quarter, and Pete
Snyder, Bob Racunas, and Gary
Foertsch scored the remaining
goals, as they outshot Fairmont,
13-5.

Snyder, the inside right from
Chatham, New Jersey, and Foer-

tsch, the left wing from M_ononga- '

hela, were the team’s top scorers
with three goals each for the sea-
son. Lee, Racunas, George Ne-
meth-, and Nick Schmidt had one
each. ’
Several of the frosh have a
chance for varsity positions since
six varsity players graduate.
“Pete Snyder and Bob Leon are
the best bets for varsity,” said
McNulty. Leon, who is from Fox
Chapel, plays center-halfback.
McNulty also said fullbacks
Joe Kruth and Blaine Popp,
goalee Bill Hogan, and utility
man Nick Schmidt show excel-
lent promise. Schmidt, who play-
ed the line most of the season,
switched to goalee in the second
half against Fairmont, “He look-
ed good,” said McNulty, “and

-Could be goalee next year.”

Consistency Marks All-American

Reichenbach’s Hustle
Helps Spark Boaters

By BILL CABIN
A person who works energetically in a rough hurried
manner is defined as a hustler. On the soccer team that
deﬁnition is synonymous with Dave Reichenbach.
Reichenbach wants to play the roughest schedule possible. “That’s

Dave Reichenbach sparks the
team this year both as a leader
and player. He leads in scoring
with ﬁve goals, and playing left
wing he has scored 19 goals in
his career here, ranking him
third in all-tirne scoring behind
George Shimpeno and Corky
Cuthbert. Last year he was chosen
all-America.

“Reichenbach has been quite
productive as a wing,” said coach
Leo Bemis, “and the boys deﬁn-
itely respect him on the ﬁeld.
He’s consistent and is a forceful
leader.”

Reichenbach matured as a. lead-
er when he was chosen co-cap-
_ , tain this year. “I had to change my
C " ‘ personality,” Reichenbach said.
DAVE REICHENBACH “As a leader, I’ve got to talk more,

" The Hustle’ take charge, and take a general
view of the team. I can’t only be concerned with myself, but must
look for strengths and weaknesses in everyone."

Reichenbach’s teammates call him “The Stone,” indicating their
respect for his playing ability and staunch character.

Reichenbach comes from Middleburg, a small town in North-
eastern Pennsylvania. “When you live in a small town,” he said, “you
either play sports or play the piano.”

Reichenbach chose sports, lettering two years in basketball, three
years in soccer, and four years in baseball. His athletic talents brought
him scholarship otfers from West Chester, Susquehanna, Brown and:
Pitt. “I chose Pitt because I wanted to go to a big school, and they
gave me a good scholarship.”

Reichenbach wants to play the roughest schedule possible.“That’s
the only way to build up soccer at any schoo ” he said. “When you
play sub-par teams long enough, there’s a tendency to start playing
like them, which hurts you when you've got to face the tough com-
petition.”

Runners to

Meet Best
In N.Y. IC4A

The IC4A cross-country meet
will be run on November 16 in
New York City. The tough Van
Cortland Park trails will be the

gathering place of some 200 col-

legiate runners.

Panther Coach Jim Banner will
send seven harriers to the meet.
They are captain John Bailey,
Damien Koch, Dave Eichenlaub,
Fran Shor, Don Hinchberger,
Frank Handleman and Tom
Serrka.

According to Banner, ﬁerce
competition can be expected from
such perennial track powers as
Georgetown, Notre Dame, Michi-
gan State and Villanova.

The Panthers will also have to
contend with the extremely rug-
ged and narrow trails of the
Bronx course.

two safeties in losing, 13-4, to
Our Gang. Andy Zilka shoveled
a two yard pass to Tom Baily
for the Gang’s ﬁrst score. Frank
O’Korn made it 7-0 with an extra
point pass from Zilka. Quarter-
back Zilka then threw 45 yards
to Bill Delvecchio for the ﬁnal

 

six points, thus landing a No-
vember 6 ﬁnalist position.
Delvecchio was respo-nsible for
all of Our Gang’s points in their
15-0 decision over the Law School
Lions. Delvecchio passed ﬁve
yards to Tom Heniff for a touch-
down and then ran for two ex-
tra points. O’Korn scored the

1. Check and mate. How about
another game? -

I'd like to, Fred, but
I have to get set for
a job interview.

“Hi there, Freddie boy,
buddy, old pal."

 

5. “You seem well rounded.
What’s your major?”

“Musicology, cum laude.
But I'm getting my M.A.
in experimental psych.”

Manpower Development Division.

 

2. Let's act it out. I’ll be

the boss. Try and sell me.
Okay.

 

3. “Good morning, Mr. F ishwick.” 4. "Just give me the facts.”

“Well, sir, I took Quine's
course in mathematical
logic, got a B in
Wittgenstein’s linguistic
analysis, and I'm a

bug on 16th-century
Flemish painting.”

 

6. “You're just the kind of man we
need—a disciplined thinker who
can tie a lot of things together
and use logic to solve complex
business problems. The M.A.
helps, too. Systems engineering
or operations research work
at Equitable is for you."

Say, how'd you know
I'm interviewin

with Equitable.
