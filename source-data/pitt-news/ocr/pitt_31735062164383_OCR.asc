Labor Disputes Sent
To Trades Council

By ALLAN SCHLOSSER.
A jurisdictional labor dispute, which threatened to dis-'

rupt University operations, has now been referred to the
Pittsburgh Building Trades Council. It was reported earlier
that Teamsters Local 249 had presented the administration
with a strike ultimatum following the layoff of a Teamster

last week.

The rumored. “walkout” was denied by Thomas Fagan,
Local 249 president, in a statement to The Pitt News. Fagan

insisted that his unionhad nev-
er called for , a walkout, but
rather that the problem was pri-
marily one of jurisdictional dif-
ferences between unions. “All
hauling must be done by Teams-
ters,” Fagan noted, “and it seems
that some of the University's
truckers are not members of our
union.”

The Building Trades Council
has scheduled a meeting today,
in order to resolve the conflict.
The Teamsters’ position, accord-
ing to Fagan, “is not based upon
the layoff of one Teamster, but
rather upon the fact that non-
Teamsters are now doing haul-
ing work for the University.”

The administration issued no of-

ﬁcial comment,

, The Teamsters at the Univer-
sity provide trucking service to
about 50 buildings on campus.
Such institutions as the Western
Psychiatric Clinic and the‘Falk
Clinic are also serviced by mem-
bers of the Teamsters Union.

In recent weeks the Universi-
ty has been quietly undergoing
budget slashing, necessitated by
deﬁcits accummulated in recent
years. The ﬁrst inkling of the
need for such austerity came
about one month ago when the
University announced that fac-
ulty salary increases would be
“more selective this year than in
the past.”

Then, last Thursday it was re-
vealed that the reductions in per-
sonnel already well under way,
would involve a total of between
150 and 200 employes, primarily
those involved in cleric.al, custo-
dial, and maintenance capacities.

Not all of those taken from
the payrolls were laid off, since
some vacancies due to resigna-
tion and retirement were left un-
ﬁlled. N0 cuts are expected either
in the faculty or in the Univer-
sity’s academic program.

Sands Guest
At Coffee Hr.

Bill Sands, a one-time cellmate
of Caryl Chessman and now a
criminal and juvenile rehabilita-
tor, will speak at a 3 p.m. coffee
hour todayin the Student Union
Lounge.

Sands will answer questions
about his Midday Series talk to-
day in which he discussed the
cause and cures’ for crime.

After serving a term in San
Quentin Prison for armed rob-
bery, his self-rehabilitation earn-
ed him a parole in 1943. He then
served in World War II and
worked as a night club entertain-
er and professional prize ﬁghter.

Judging For
Spirit Award
Revamped

The Spirit Award Commit-
tee of Student Government
has cancelled Spirit Award
competition for the remain-
der of the basketball games
and the Winter Weekend
Carnival. John Dugan, co-
chairrnan, said the decision
was made on the recommenda-
tion of several Student Govern-
ment senators.

The ﬁnal opportunity for groups
to gain Spirit Award points will
be a song writing contest. “Songs
are to be school songs, appropri-
ate for group singing and of a
style that will remain popular
for several years,” Dugan said.
Twenty-four points will be given
to each group entering a song.

Songs must have original words
and melody or an adopted mel-
ody. If the melody is adopted,
copyright obligations must be ful-
ﬁlled. _

The participating group or a
representative will perform the
song for Spirit Award judges in
the Student Union Ballroom Feb.
16. Appointments .are being ar-
ranged through Barbara Good-
man, ext. 7759.

Several winning entries will be
selected by the judges to be pub-
lished as official University songs.

Saga Gets Complaints
About Food, Service S

Saga Food Service has promised to look into a list of
complaints aired by the Grievance Committee of Men's

Dorm Council.

Harvey Altholtz, committee chairman, met on Monday
with Larry Rigglernan, manager of Saga Food Service, to
present him with an assortment of 17 complaints ﬁled by

men living in the three towers.

The grievances included elim-
ination of the “stagger system”
and a return to the “seconds”
line at each meal; larger por-
tions of meat with less fat; more
frequent servicing of condiment
stands and milk and soda dis-
pensers; fresh rolls and food
served .at proper temperatures.

Also, fruit and juices at every
meal; chopped ice available for
sodas; two ice cream lines on
Sunday nights and fresh  A

student had complained that the
milk was once sour.

Altholtz urged that the menu
be consistent throughout each
meal; appealed for an .all-pur-
pose vending machine that serves
soup, hot chocolate, and coffee,
and said thatfsome “elderly wom-
en in the cafeteria are sassy to

Philosophy of Science

By PETE HORN

Notre Dame Professor Ernan
McMullin brought to his Monday
night Philosophy of Science lec-
ture on Galileo an impressive
list of qualiﬁcations. He proved
himself a knowledgeable man.

But the Irish-accented priest
somehow failed to inspire in his
audience any vital spirit. The
usual complement of pointless
questions afterward served only
to kick dirt on the grave in which
Professor McMullin had interred
the old telescope-maker.

It seems word had gotten out
beforehand. Several regular lec-
ture - goers were conspicuously
absent, for one reason and an-
other.

Wl1o’s aio?

The high point of the lecture
was McMullin’s failure to re-re-
fute the most refuted myth in the
history of science—that of Galileo
performing his Leaning Tower of
Pisa falling-bodies experiment

Galileo, Pr 0 f es s o r McMullin
said, may best be viewed as a
watershed between medieval and
modern methodologists of sci-
ence. Each historian ascribes to
Galileo his own philosophical
orientation.

Galileo sought from science an
absolute knowledge, according to
Professor McMullin. He saw laws
of nature as mathematical truths.
He restrained his metaphysics by
experience, and tempered th a t
with his grounding in instrumen-

McMullin said so in such a way
that the audience nodded, and
not in agreement.

Ohio University conferred a B.S.E.E. degree on
C. T. Huck in 1956. Tom knew of Western Elec-
tric’s history of manufacturing development. He
realized, too, that our personnel development pro-
gram was expanding to meet tomorrow's demands.
After graduation, Tom immediately began to
work on the development of electronic switching
systems. Then, in 1958, Tom went to the Bell Tele-
phone Laboratories on a temporary assignment to
help in the advancement of our national military
capabilities. At their Whippany, New Jersey, labs,
Tom worked with the W.E. development team on
computer circuitry for the Nike Zeus guidance sys-
tem. Tom then moved on to a new assignment at

The long awaited appearance of Lawrence Monnett at a special Stu-

ltdent Affairs meeting last week was most satisfactory in accomplishment
 and indicated strong possibilities for continued student-administrative

interaction. _

After a two-hour meeting that morning with Student Government
president John Vrana, the vice-chancellor for business affairs came to the
meeting armed with positive answers for every proposal SG had listed. He
offered to split Book Center proﬁts 50-50 with the students either in the

‘V form of a discount or an addition to the low appropriation for student organ-

izations, whichever the students themselves decide. He arranged that the
$2500 proﬁt on the Athletic Identiﬁcation_ Cards be allotted to the Student
Affairs area as well. This money was formerly used by Ath;ltic Director
Frank Carver to help allay the $3500 annual payment he must make to
visiting teams under National Collegiate Athletic Association which re-

I quires 25 cents payment for each non-paying customer.

Monnett also assured the students that the University is lobbying
for the removal of the five per cent sales tax on texts in Harrisburg, that

3

 

he will help them ﬁnd better space for the SG Book Exchange, and that he
would be most amenable to an Activities Fee if the students wanted it.

One of the most significant outcomes of this meeting was an in-
sured involvement of future student leadership in ﬁnancial decisions affect-
ing them directly. For the ﬁrst time this year, a subcommittee of the Stu-
dent Affairs Committee, composed of students, faculty, and administration,
went over the proposed budgets for student organizations and recom ended
a distribution structure to Dr. Alan Rankin. The added allotments now of
Book Center and ID Card proﬁts will grant the students even more responsi-
bility in the gradual increase of their involvement in administrative deci-
sions.

This growth, indeed, has been two-way: students ‘had to prove their
interest as well as their responsibility in presenting their proposals; ad-
ministration had to realize the value of some of these suggestions and the
sincerity of the students in driving for co-operation. Both parties deserve
commendation for their success this year.

 

   

Professor Orgel
Praises Article

  Editor, The Pitt News:

Fred Frank's article about

lfcheatirig on campus is an. aston-
lishing piece of reporting. By us-
ing their exact words, Mr. Frank

was able to convey the char-
acters of his two anonymous
cheaters more clearly and effec-
tively than could ever be done
in a moralistic tract or psycho-
logical analysis.

Lack of integrity, irresponsi-
bility, weakness, scapegoating,
and rationalization shine forth
from every sentence; and through
all, there appears not one tiny
bit of guilt to cloud the picture.

Most amazing, though, is the
fact} that each man is able to re-
veal himself so completely in
spite of. his abominable syntax
and impoverished vocabulary.
Here indeed is a testimony to the
technique of passing Freshman
English by purchasing themes!

Arthur R. Orgel, Ph.D.

Cheating Story
Causes Thought

Editor, The Pitt News:'

It would be naive for us to
say that we were shocked by ‘the
articles of“Fred Frank on cheat-
ing, However, we certainly did
not realize the great prevalence
of it, nor what the actual atti-

' ‘_ .- ‘ tude of the “student who cheats”
is. We- want -‘comment on their
..feelings of where the fault lies.

One factor mentioned was “lazy

’ - ,?.‘profes;sors who repeat tests sem-
 after semester.” f"1‘rue,‘ this _
'is"'a ltempting situation and a ,

disgraceful .way‘ for, a professor
to run his course. It‘ indicates to

I us that he cares so little about

the course and the students who

1 take it that he gives no thought

to ever changing or iniproving
his lectures or exams from tri-
mester to trimester.

The “moral code of the Univer-
sity student body” was also cited.
Admittedly, we have heard stu-
dents occasionally boasting of
their prowess at this game, as

» they seem to think of it. To a

student with wish-washy ideals
and personal standards, to over-
hear something like the follow-
ing could perhaps les sen any
qualms he has about cheating.
“Once I took a test for another
kid; I“ didn’t charge. I got away
with it. It “La

about 200 kids in the class. I just
walked in.” After all, other kids
do it, it’s easy, and they never
get caught.

It is too bad that this student’s

parents and friends never made

a big deal about academic in-
tegrity. But, now the student has
grown up, presumably, and can
think for himself. “Am I inter-
ested in learningfor 1eaming’s
sake? Do I want an education so
I will be able to better those
things in society with which I am
dissatisﬁed? Or do I want to learn
the most effective and quickest
way of stepping on people to get
to the top? Do I want a good
job in which I am competent and
interested to help support a fami-
ly? Or do I want to fudge my
way through this farce of term
papers and distribution require-
ments to “earn” a degree to in-
sure lots of money and social
prestige? I

“Why did I come to Pitt? What
do I want?” We think that every
student should ask himself the
above questions if he isn’t afraid.
Perhaps then the male honors
sophomore could answer his
“why.” John Vrana summed it up

precisely. “I feel there is a cor-
relation between interest and de-

Universal Cowards

 \\\\ B3' Nancy Delaney

The University of Pittsburgh is replete with cowards.
It is a cowardly act to hide behind a regulation and say,
“It‘is so, I_can do nothing.” There are‘ many here who are
trying to hide in-such a manner, and hence there are many
cowards here. Protest as they may, there is no way for
_ them‘ to escape the charges. To do so, they -must either
deny; 1) that they perform such acts, or 2) thatsuch acts
arein fact cowardly. But they can do neither; for consider:
1) There certainly are people af-
ﬁliated with the University of Pitts-
burgh who utter such fatalistic state-
5 ments as, “That’s just the way it is.
? I can do nothing about it. I’m sorry,
but you lose.”

. SUCH PEOPLE are invariably as-
sociated with bureaucracies. Their
existence is- an empirical fact. You
 have observed them and I have ob-
 served them. Minor administrators
,_ :_ are probably the chief offenders, al-
. . ' though top administrators have also
5 MISS DELANEY been known to make such assertions.
It is difficult for all but the most seasoned liars among the
top administrators to do so, however, since they are person-
ally responsible for the regulations, and hence “I can do
nothing” is a boldfaced prevarication. And it is still diffi-
cult even for the most seasoned liars to keep a straight face
when they say “I’m sorry.”

2) Is such an action cowardly? The question falls into
a familiar logical structure, for there are two alternatives:
either a) it really “is so,” or b) it is not so.

a) IT REALLY IS SO, as they claim, which means
something like’, “The situation is inflexible”—-inflexible in
the sense that, for instance, it is just fiscally impossible to
change the situation because of the present state of the
budget. Any moralist who specializes in cowardice, how-
ever, will immediately agree that if the existing situation
is bad enough, the true hero would say, “The budget be

   

damned. Change the situation, anyway.” In doing so, he .

may have to attack the very basis of a budget that is spread
too thin in order to achieve too -much too soon. He may even
. have to be so audacious as to point out that a new $11 mil-
_ lion library is hardly any -use if students and faculty are
locked out of it for as many hours a week as they are from

" t-he present“-one. Since everyone can recognize this fact, he . ~ .

who does not point ‘it ~out, is in all surety,-a coward. »
' This particular form of cowardice is called “comprom-

‘‘ - ising.’’ A minor administrator once commented “Comprom-

' "ise-.i-sf- a dirty word‘-.tn_,most students..'"Ind'eed it is. But stu-

dents are‘ not-re'ally’_apt to be harshin their judgment of . ,: I

this kind" of coward.‘ It is ‘widely recognized that it is not
really a form of moral cowardice, but merely a sort of pe-
cuniary cowardice arising from the need for job insurance.
Even the law allows a man self-defense—and starvation is
such a low death.

b) IT REALY IS NOT SO. They are then tenaciously
holding their position merely because 1) they have already
told you it is their position, and even if you have presented
a ﬁne argument as to why it should not be, they are afraid
of losing face; or 2) they are the type of people who get a
kick out of telling thin old women they look malignant; or
3) they are clinging to a Principle for Principle’s sake. The
cowardice is obvious in the ﬁrst two cases. The deep moral
cowardice involved in the third case was pointed out in my
last column.

Thus, there certainly are many people at the University
of Pittsburgh who do make such assertions, and such asser-
tions are in fact cowardly acts. QED: The University of
Pittsburgh is replete with cowards.

As a brief suggestions on how to deal with the problem,
I refer the coward to two references: 1) Professor Nicholas
Rescher’s discussion (in his book Introduction to Logic) on
how to refute a dilemma; or 2) Saint Paul's discussion (in
his Epistles) on how- to. attain moral virtue.

Pittsburgh Symphony

By BILL SMITH

John Pritchard conducted
the last of the four subscrip-
tion concerts with the Pitts-
burgh Symphony last week-
end and the people of Pitts-
burgh are the poorer for his

i going.

In the short time Pritchard has
been here, he has been able to
weld the orchestra into a well
disciplined musical ensemble. He
has had to cope with a violin
section characterized by occas-
sional squeakiness; a French horn
section that is weak in chairs
two, three, and four; a trumpet
section that has little under-
standing of the term “phrasing”;
and a ﬂute section intent -on
forcing its tone upon orchestra
conductor, and audience alike.

This is counterbalanced by a
strongviola, cello, and bass com-
plement, excellent oboe work,
steady clarinet and bassoon per-
formance and ﬁne percussion
work.

Pritchard’s thorough under-
standing of the musical score '
combined with his good under-‘
standing of this particular group
of musicians has resulted in an
integrated, balanced, and con-
trolled sound, the likes of which

I has not been heard over the past

two years.

Pritchard, a large man as con-
ductors go (6’2”), believes in us-
ing his entire person to express
physically for the audience, as
well as for the musicians, what
the music is implying. His use of
somewhat unorthodox gestures is
a means of generating in hi:
players and listeners the mood
and spirit the composer intended.
For this, after all, is the basic
function of a conductor: to re-

create faithfully what the crea-
tive artist has already set lorth.

Thus, Pritchard dances on the
podium in an excellent imitation
of a baby chick (“Pictures at an
Exhibition”). He pleads with the
celos for more vibrato or stern-
ly exhorts the violins for more
expression. He rears back and
‘literally explodes downbeats on
his orchestra and they answer
with resounding fortissimos. The
audience, needless to say, loves
it.

Pritchard’s last concert was a
good one despite his illness this
past week which prevented him
from rehearsing the orchestra the
usual number of times. The M0-
zart “Eine Kleine Nachtmusik”
was, for the most part, controlled
and balanced. The Bruch violin
concerto with Itzhak Perlman as
soloist went well, even though
Perlman and Pritchard were fre-
quently not together. This was
due, undoubtedly, to the lack of
rehearsal time and perhaps to
the youth and relative ‘inexperi-
-ence of Perlman. ' , ,

Perlman’s tone, especially in
the lower register,» was warm
and expressive. His playing in
the upper range was-for the most
part true and he proved himself
a. ﬁne technician. There is little
doubt that Perlman has the po-

tential to be one of the great -

violinists of our time.

The Debussy “Nocturnes” pro-
vided Pritchard with the oppor-
tunity to display his excellent
taste and magniﬁcent control. He
was more than equal to the task.
The Chatham College choir,-how-
ever, which performed, in the
third nocturne, sounded tired and
shallow which detracted from

In fairness to the choir, it is
not an easy piece to perform .and
the lack of rehearsal time with
the conductor probably hurt
them. Nevertheless, their tone
was broad and unpleasant and
their voices, in general, too im-
mature to do the piece justice.

The Britten piece is a delight-
ful endeavor which joins one of
England’s best old composers
with one of their best new com-
posers. Pritchard proved he is
capable of capitalizing on the
composer's humor, although he
showed he was also capable of
exploiting tempo markings.

The rousing fugue at the end,
which is then joined with Pur-
cell’s theme, was indeed a bril-
liant way to end the concert and
Pritchard’s stay with the orches-
tra. He will be sorely missed for
he has provided Pittsburgh audi-
ences with four memorable con-
certs.

.along in improving his skills.”

By BILL CABIN
Wrestlers Lee Hall and Tom Heniff have both risen from
medicore sophomore seasons two years .ago to have the best rec-
ords on this year’s team. They exemplify the ability to improve.
Hall began improving last year, after compiling a 4-4 record
as a sophomore. He was undefeated in dual meet competition,
and was runner-up to Penn State’s Marty Strayer in the 167-

When Ken Barr graduated, Hall moved into the 177-pound
division and has since been a stalwart, compiling a 3-0-1 record.
His draw was with Syracuse’s Tom Chlendorf, who had beaten
reigning Eastern champ Gerry Franzen twice this year.

Last week Captain Hall’s win over Maryland’s Bob Karch
gave the matmen their ﬁrst win.

Heniif’s progress has not been as abrupt as Hall’s, but he <
appears to be reaching his peak now. He had a 2-3 record as a
sophomore, and a 3-1-1 dual meet record last year, losing in
the ﬁrst round of the Easterns.

Heniff, however, is already 3-0 this year in the 123-pound
division. “He’s deﬁnitely improved over last year,” said coach
Rex Peery. “He started in g0Od condition and has come right

Both Hall and Heniff test their undefeated records in a <
rigorous tri-dual meet at Ohio State Saturday. The matmen
* wrestle Ohio State, Purdue, and Virginia Tech from 1:00 to‘5:00
p.m., each wrestler having an hour break between matches.

. They also face the best in the East in ensuing weeks, .wrest-
ling at Cornell, Lehigh, Penn State, and the EIWA tournament.

their ﬁrst‘ two matches, Captain
Aldo Zortea and Neil Katz lead
the team to its comeback victory
in the ensuing three matches.

Panthers Now Show 5-10 Mark  
After Close Decision on Road

A second half surge en-
abled the Panther basket-
ball team to gain a decision
over the Westmlnister Ti-
tans at New Wilmington
last night, 75-61. The win
gave the 5-10 record and
two wins in their last three_
games.

The Jungle Cats were be-
hind 31-28 at the half, but

‘within five minutes after

the teams took the floor
again the Panthers had tak-
en the lead. Consistent foul
shooting and good defense
won the game according to
Coach Bob Timmons.

Jim LaCalley who has been
playing good ball for us lately
rebounded well and stopped their
leading scorer Bob Oravitz. “Or-
avetz was held way below his
average only managing 15 points.

High score for the Panthers
was Daryle Ruby who put in 24
points “Ruby has also come ar-
ound in the last few games he
has been scoring well and get-

BOB LOVE'l"l‘ found the mark
again scoring, after having two
bad games on the road last week-
end. He was second high for the
Panthers with 21 points

ting .a lot of key rebounds. He's
been hitting his jump shot a lot
better especially against a zone
like Westministers,’ and seems to
have a little more hustle,” said
Timmons.

Unbeaten Tracksters Must
Continue to Improve Reco

Halfway through the ‘season, Panther tracksters are
undefeated. In two meets so far. the Panthers faced their

easiest competition. Only Army and Navy stand between
the track team and an undefeated season. Both teams repre-
sent formidable blocks, with Navy perhaps being the strong-

er of the two.

Luddy Hayden is one track
man who is conﬁdent that the
squad will have an unblemished
record. “If we can win over
Army here in the Field House,
then I think we will take Navy
there. Our best weapon against
Army will be their conﬁdence,”
said Hayden. “They have really
slaughtered us in the past and
will probably expect to repeat
this year. They know Kent State
is not in their class and they
have probably not even heard of
Slippery Rock, so our two wins

‘will not impress them at all.

Hopefully we will catch them off
guard.”

For the Panthers to beat the
service academies, .a strong effort
will be necessary by all perform-
ers. As yet, coach Carl Rees has
not found a fourth runner for the
mile relay event. And both run-
ners he used against Slippery
Rock ran poorly. Neither Kent
State nor Slippery Rock ran a
two-mile relay team, so how well
the Panthers can run, is uncer-
tain, nor is it even certain just

who will run the event.

Four men scored in double fig-
ures for the Panthers. Bob Lovett
was second in scoring to Ruby’s
24 with 21 points, Larry Szkowny
had twelve, and accounted for
numerous assists and Brian Fish-
er_had eleven.

The place where the Panthers
won the game Was on the foul
line where they cashed in on 80
per cent of their foul attempts.
They sunk 29 of 36, foul shots
while the Titan could only hit
on eleven free throws.
