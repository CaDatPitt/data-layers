 By MINNIE BUCKLEY JACKSON, Col. '15, Law '13
524 FOURTH AVENUE. PITTSBURGH

SEEIORS and members of the
Class if 1928, whether graduated in
Feb  y, June or August, will be
givengmembership in the General
Alumni Association for the ensuing
year if they attend the Sunset Din-
ner at. the Gym on Saturday, June
9. This membership of course in-
cludes: the Pitt Weekly for _the neat
year. This is the ﬁrst time this
concession has been made by the
Association, the minimum fee for
membership being ordinarily $3. Dor-

 othy Ream as President of the

Senior Women is heading the Senior

.\Committee which is working for a
‘record attendance for their group.

I

. nobody ' drowns!

The price of the dinner for Seniors

is $2. This is the ﬁrst alumnae af-

fair the seniors may attend and it
is hoped they will all turn out _to
get acquainted with their older sis-
ters. ’

.‘'*;g ......0.._.

SWIMMING PARTY to be held
afterthe Sunset Dinner in the pool
at the~Gym- is being sponsored by
the girls of the Women’s Athletic
Association but of course is for all
women who attend the Sunset Din-

4 net. RUTH GRUSCH, '26, is mak-

ing arrangements and promises a
professional in attendance to give a
few instructions and see to it that
(This party will
give some opportunity to ﬁnd out
whether you or your substitute pass-
ed your swimming test before you
graduated!) The Committee now
feels that ample provision has been
made to cool off those who always

I complain of the heat at the Sunset

 Dinner.

_ Wrap your towel and bath-
ing suit in a neat package, check
with your wraps and join the Swim

-2 after the dinner.

._o.__

M0-B SINGING’will be led by Mr...

James. H. Greene, coach of the Wom-
en’s Glee Clubs at the University.
It is considered particularly fortu-
nate that Mrs. Greene has consent-
ed" to: direct, since the Sunset Din-

ner is an especially sing-y occasion.

As one alumna put it, everybody
wants-‘ to sing, it‘ only everybody will
sing at the same time, so as not-‘ to
have any solo work heard! Well,

..Mrs. Greene will be there and it is

said she can be just as festive in

fher song leading as the spirit of the

dinner‘ demands. And the old songs
will ht: there--plus any new songs or
parodies that may be written be-
tween:’; now and then and turned in
to anl5t’member of .the Committee,

‘- ultimately to reach Bernice Story.

._._0.—-.

TABLE ARRANGEMENTS are in
charge of Mary Dodds, ’25, assisted
by Catherine Moore, ’21, and Nancy
Jennings," ’26. Reunion classes
(early classes and 1918, 1923, 1927
and 1928) will be seated at special
tables. Any other groups of con-
siderable size who wish to sit to-
gether will be provided for on re-
quest before the day of the dinner
to one of the Committee.

. :O-—-
. DECORATIONS planned are ex-
pected to transform the Gym into
something that it isn’t, whatever
that is! Venus Shakarian with a
Committee from the Class of 1927
are very ambitious and determined
to work out some sort of illusion.

[Garden ﬂowers and greens there will

be a-plenty.
._...o....

‘HONOR GUESTS invited are Mrs.
John G. Bowman, Mrs. S. B. Mc-
Cormick, Mrs. S. B. Linhart, Mrs.
F. W. Shockley, Mrs. J. G. Quick,
Mrs. Lee P. Sieg, Dean Thyrsa
Amos, Dr. Marian Shepard, Miss

Mrs. J. Huber Wagner.

RECEPTION given by Mrs. Bow-

man and Dean Amosxat the Faculty

‘ Club from four to six that afternoon,

to which all alumnae and seniors,

with their honor guests, are invited,
is the beginning of the Sunset Din-
ner. It is the place where the real
reunions ﬂower since the time and
the place and the atmosphere lend
themselves to quiet conversation.
_.__o——-

DINNER will be served immedi-
ately after the reception—at the
Gymnasium at six o’clock. At the
reception and at the dinner “Peg”

hoping there will be so many in at-
tendance from their respective
classes that they will be very, very
busy greeting everybody. It takes
a one hundred per cent attendance
to make a successful reunion.
.._o....

LAST, and possibly most impor-
tant for the party, the responsibilit
for the general program lies wit
Anne Klingensmith, ’20. Informa-
tion has come through that she
plans a program similar in type to
but entirely different in material
from, the very successful program
staged last year by Helena Flinn
Gregg, ’20. Last year witnessed the
evolution of dress,-over a period of
Twenty-ﬁve years. This year-you
must come and see for yourself!
Anne is being assisted of course by
the Reunion Committees since it is
their members who will take part.

.._o__.

REMEMBER: That your name
must be on the list of reservations
in order to assure you a place at
the dinner. These are being taken
by_.Bernice L. Storey, General Chair-
man, care of Ralston Industrial
High School, or Montrose 1754, and
must be made not later than Thurs-
day, June 7. Catering service re-
quires that all places ordered be
paid for; hence no more are ordered
than reserved. <Make your reserva-
tion early! The best way to reach
the Gym is by way of Aliquippa
Street, since there is then no uphill
walking. Take a Center Avenue
Car from the‘ downtown or trans-
fer-tos,a, Center Avenue Car in the

, "‘A Prescr'£pt*ion"

i Have you ever noticed
f right after a meal
iH_ow tired and lazy
. you always feel?
I’m telling you folks .
_it isn't a Joke,
It willifreshen you u \
if you try a goo smoke‘.
But whatever you do _
these lines you must heed,
,There’s a certain tobacco
of course, that you need.
It’s packed in a tin,
the tin’s colored blue.
Not only the smoking
but the chewing ind too.
Of course if you never
are bothered this way,
Just keep the prescription
for some other day.
Ask for tobacco,
the best that's on earth;

‘ The’ University has planned a pre-.

tentious program for Frick Acres, a_.

program which it maytake another
decade to ﬁnlsh. A blue print. of the
proposed, ground plan reveals the
fact that from the’ midst of — the
grounds will rise; the towering Cathe-
dral of Learning with approaches
from Fifth avenue, Forbes street and
Bigelow boulevard-. Surrounding the
lot ‘will be long ranges of dormitories
matching the main building in archi-
tecture _ and construction. These
dorms will border principally on the
west side of the grounds while the
Belleﬁeld ‘avenue elevation will be
surrounded with large laboratories
comparing in style withthe dwelling
quarters.

' it 8 #

The‘Bel1eﬁe1d elevation will also

 sontain a small and architecturally
 simp

chapel for student worship.
The chapel will be ﬂanked on the

. Fifth avenue side with the Darling-
. ‘ ton Memorial Library and with simi-

lar buildings on its Forbes street
side. The entire lot will be laid out
with symmetrical exactness, and
will contain spacious lawns with
wide walks. No autos "will be per-

mitted to enter the Cathedral
grounds in order to safeguard
against traffic obstructions and
confusion. * *

s

The theme of the entire group of
buildings will be the architectural
‘style of the Cathedral of Learning.
The plan IS pretentious and when
eventually completed will give the
University one of the most beautiful

BUILDING PROGRAM
PLANNED. SAYS GOW

Medical Center Is .Maturing.
Admission, Cooperative
Work Discussed

Development of apprentice ‘educa-

 

tion and the welfare’ of faculty‘

members were discussed by J.

Steele Gow, executive secretary of
the Universit , in a talk. at Fac-
ult « Club Fri ay, on “Problems and
Po icies of the University.” The
talk was given before the Pittsburgh
chapter of the association profes-
sors. As a part of the physical ex-
pansionof‘ the University, after re-
ferringé to. the Falk memorial-~ and
the Darll-ngton library, Mr. Gow out-
lined the medical‘ center plans that
“We should
soon hear announcements that the
Presbyterian - H o s, p i tal will be
erected on this site, and that plans
are maturing for a medical labora-
tory: building, and a home for
nurses," stated Mr. Gow. “Further,”
he continued, “the need for a Uni-
versity chapel has become so obvious
that. a way will be found to pro-

. vide it."

Ur e Entrance Changes -
Interna problems that are chal-

lenging. the U.niversity, in Mr. Gow’s

opinion, include. admission ‘of stu-
dents, to the University and. advising
of students" at- the time of their reg-
istration. “In many: quarters, ‘high
schools are urging changes in our
entrance requirements. ‘ I hope,’.’
continued Mr.‘ Gow, “to have a com-

.mittee. of the faculty at work on
this problem. of admission. of stu-

dents to the, University. For the
past, two or three years we have
found’, that twenty-four to thirty-
phree percent of the students have
ri some respects been «unsatisfac-
torily advised‘ in their choices of
studies.” As,’ a solution to this

problem Mr. Gow said that perhaps A

ex rt advisers will be trained, who
willehave this job asa deﬁnite‘ part

of . their university duties.

Discusses Business Co-‘op Work,

Mr. Gow,in discussing the grow-
ing development in the University of
apprenticeship education, pointed

vout that “the co-operative scheme

in the school of engineering is now;
being duplicated by the school of

tion‘ of their families will no doubt
be carefully considered by the trus-I

tees, but the need for them has be-
come so obvious that it seems rea-

T‘ FROM‘ 8. ‘A.

, FEW weeks back _Bluco

Ibanez’s Roads and Mud, bo-
‘ cause the natural back-
ground seemed to share in determin-
ing the narrative, reminded us of
Thomas Hardy. Another novel
written under Spanish inﬂuence,
Hugo West’: Black Valley (Long-
man’e, 32.50), “a romance of the
Argentine.” does the same. The

   

nuoo 'wAs'r'
bleak‘ foothill country of the Andes,
so well does Sr. Wast picture it,
made us think of the inﬂuence of

- Egdon Heath, and in the people, dif-

ferent though thcy are and not as
real, we saw Eustacia Vye and the
other characters of ‘Hardy's trage-
dies.

Black Valley, too, is a tragedy.
Flavia loved her brother’: enemy,
Camargo. Their daughter, born
secretly, liveswith Camnrgo on a
nearby estate. But because of the
feud between the men, Flavia never

her brother's care, may grow,

that he loves ‘her niece instead.
Though charged by one reviewer

Valley is certainly free. of muscular
gauchos, tango-trippers,-' senoritaa
with daggers between their teeth,
and similar type embellishments of
most South American fiction known
to American readers. ‘To us it was
convincing, and it satisﬁed an inter-
est in the life of the Argentine coun-
tryside. There is something more to
the world than New York, Zenith,
and Pittsburgh. 1

Hugo West is the pen-name of
Gustavo A. Martinez Zuviria, most
popular of South American novel-
ists. Black Valley won for him a
Royal Spanish Academy‘ prize. More
of his work, it is promised, will be

URING the past year" we
D have called attention to se-
ries of books at popular
prices: Everyman’s, M o-daern
Library, etc.' Another that merits
more publicity than its publishers
and the dealers have given in Apple-
ton’s Dollar Library. Of pocket-size,
bound in green cloth, the series" in-
cludes, in addition to the two talked
about below, such titles as Arthur
Goodrich’s and Rose A. Palmer's
Capomacchi, Don Marquis’ Noah.
an’ Jonah’ an’ Cap’n John Smith,
and Gilbert Murray's A History of
Ancient Greek Literature.
’ I
In all courses in modern litera-
ture, George Moore is included as
an equal of Wells, Bennett, and
Galsworthy. This perplexes many
students. If a book is assigned, it is
usually Confusions of a Young
Man, and though interesting to
those alert to matters aesthetic, it
arouses doubts as to Mr. Moore’s im-
portdnce. This ‘has’ been unfortu-
nate, but his other works have been
‘so unavailable that it was almost
impossible to know Esther Waters,
The Mummcfs Wife, Evelyn Innes,
and the other novels that explain
his fame. Like George Bernard
Shaw, Mr. Moore does not believe
in giving himself away to the.public.
Now, though, Evelyn Innes is
available in the Appleton Dollar
Library. It is a naturalistic novel
of a girl struggling in the conflict-
ing demands of love, career, and re-
ligion. Evelyn, leaving her father,
went with Sir Owen to train. her
voice in France. At heart she was
a devout Catholic; her immediate
success in opera did not quiet her
doubts as to the morality of her
relations with Sir Owen. And there
was a second lover. The title of the
sequel to Evelyn Innes, Sister
Teresa, conveys the outcome. The
reality of Evelyn and the richness’
in detail of the supporting back-

ground make most recent novels
thin in comparison. It will have spe-

cial appeal for readers who know
music; as Evelyn, her father, and
her lovers are musicians, the book
is full of musical allusions.

OUNTEE CULLEN, because
_ last year the Quill Club
, brought him here to read his

 

poetry and the local chapter of

Alpha Phi Alpha gave him 9. medal
of achievement, has among us at

i advantages over other young Negro

writers. His poetry, however, war-
rants the advantage; to the exuber-
ance’. of Negro life it adds a. lyric-
ism that promises much. If you have
doubts read Color.

Mr. Cullen’: newest book is The
Ballad of the Brown Girl (Ha!-pars,
$2.00), a retelling of the old ballad
in Percy's Reliques, “Lord Thomas
and Fair Ellinor,” found also as
“Lord. Thomas and Fair Annet.” Of
the two women Lord Thomas loved
—Fair London and the Brown Girl
--his mother advised him to marry
the Brown Girl, because she had
wealth. , At the wedding, Feir "Lon-
don intimated that the bride was
inferior to Lord Thomas. The Brown
Girl stabbed Fair London; Lord,
Thomiis strangled the Brown Girl:
and the ballad ends in complete
tragedy. It is a haunting story, and
Mr. Cullen. tells it well.

The day may come when beauti-
ful books will be taken for granted.
As that day is not yet here, The
Ballad of the Brown Girl must’ be"
"mentioned for its appearance, as
well as its contents. Harpcrs have
printed it on vellum paper, deco-
rated‘ it with black and white draw-
ings by Charles Cullen, brother of
the poet, bound it in black" back-
cloth and straw-colored boards, and
boxed, it in dark green. In all, 3

What Is 3 University

Editor The Weekly: ,
The word college is an a.bln~svl- ‘
ated form of the word colleague,
and a colleague in one chosen» at
the same time’ with another to
work with him at a common task.
Isn't  just exactly what you
have in a coll ‘ ' tive
officers, teachers and students
working simultaneously to foster
knowledge? A university is sim-
ply a grouprof colleges working as
a unit. If one accepts this social
view of a. . university, how can
any one of the colleages be a col-
league and foster the ago-old tradi-
tion of antipathy betwee'n
groups ‘interested? '

What Is A Student Publication For?
The greatest agency‘ on any
campus for promoting this social
concept of a. university in the stu-
dent journal. It can be the one
dynamic spokesman for all the col-
leagues. It can be the medium for
the finest words of appreciation, for
incisive, but constructive criticism,
and for suggestions for mutual bet-
-terment. The university student
journal should set the standards of

the means ntita command such an
no other organization possesses. It
reaches more students. and it ever
carries" the spell of the printed
word. It, more than any other,
should exemplify co-operation with
other activities if its relationship
to them is‘ uniform and enlightened.

.only a spectator ‘of student affairs,
but it should also be an interpreter.
It should never forget for a min-
ute» that it is itself a student 
tivlty, calling forth as varied 
Vsponsoe as other activities. 
right of interpretation, of course,
traditionally is the prerogative. of
the editorial page, but should it be
conﬁned there? It iasig-niilcant in
building university spirit not only
to know the facts, but somehow to

' know and to show what" matters.

The Pitt Weekly

The make-up and general ap-
reportorial work shows an in-
creased dignity, with more of an
eﬂort to get at the signiﬁcance of
news item! and less stress on
strictly social aﬂ“airs. There have
been some excellent editorials. In
general, it has been far more vital
than ever before.

Every student activity has a
statement of. purpose in its consti-
tution. Does the Pitt Weekly have
such a  defined purpose? If
so, why not’ set it forth in every
issue? '

If The Pitt Weekly is to he the
moulder of ‘ public opinion and the
interpreter of Itndent life, would
this function be greatly enriched if
The Weekly had more vital contact‘-
with student activities than that
given by the reporters to whom
often each student event is merely
an automatic assignment? Most
organizations think ..of -The Pitt
Weekly an a thing apart, to be ap-
proached with fear and trembling
or usuppliante. . ' ' '-

And this ienlt helped any by the
fact thntlit is an aclzlvttywhich is
ﬁnancially remlaneralive to the stu-
dents directing it. '

The Pitt Weekly has stressed .a

He doesn't make himself famous
by falling of horses. Nor does he
incite the censure of his royal
parents by marrying without regard
-for their wishes. He merely comes
to school like any other Pitt stu-

Just -this time of the year when
‘nature dresses herself in green he
writes about stories his _father, _a

ried a woman not of his father's
choice; he was then disinherited by
the aged baron. Not long after Herr
Fredrick Jo...“°pl'i Von Kuhns had his
name changed 1''‘ Mr. John F. Kuhn,
an attorney came to see him with
the news of his father’s death. The
dying message of the old baron was
to tell his prodigal son that he had
been long since forgiven and that
he should return to Germany to
claim the title and vast steel mills.
He went back to Germany where
he broke a sword over his late
father’s coffin (an old family’ cus-
tom signifying that death is the only
unconquerable foe),

his only son, his brothers, and the
German minister to United States,
he renounced all claim to the title
and swore allegiance to the United
States ﬁrst. His property was then
seized. , .

Match Of Year

Mustering all their strength in
order to close their home season
in a blaze of glory the Golden Pan-
tha tennis men overwhelmed op-
position from Westmiister
Penn State by huge scores on suc-
cessive days. Westminster was the

l
:

dians, vaulting 12 feet 6 inches. Re-
turning from the Olympic Carnival
he lingered in the British Isles long
enough to capture the Irish and
Scottish records in the pole vault,
establishing marks in both Ireland

andgand Scotland that have stood un-

touched since his farewell perform-

victim of the first shutout the Pan-i‘mC°S'

thers have scored this
score being 7-0.
a  showing than the men
vanquished on the previous day,
winning two of the nine matches.

The Westminster match was

layed Friday afternoon before a
arge gallery. The yearling track
men were dueling Kiski at the
same time, and attracted a num-
ber1,of onlookers who were equally
interested in the tennis match. The
courts were rather damp from the
morning rains, but the play was
not affected to any extent. The
Panthers played excellent tennis,
showing better formthan they have
exhibited all season. They swept
thmuw every match in straight
sets, estminster getting only one
set the entire day. .

The match betwee-.. Cable of
Pitt and Robinson of Westminster
was.-the best match of the day. Ca-
ble lostithe ﬁrst match 1-6, but
1.’Illying,»"best his opponent in the
next two sets by love scores.
_ -The Penn State match, played on
the stadium courts Saturday after-
noon, was the last home match of
the ‘Panthers this season. The
boys, having made such an excel-
lent showing Friday, rose to su-
areme heights to turn the Blue'and

hite invaders back by an over-
whelming score 7-2.

The- gallery at this match was
larger than at 'any other match
this season. A reat number of
State rooters an Pitt tennis fans
were outnumbered" by the large
group of high school people, who

ad come to watch the intersch'olas-
tic track meet, and ﬁnding the
tennis match more interesting,
turned their interest in that direc-
tion.
” The skies were cloudy and rain
threatened throughout, though the
_courts,were damp enough to settle
the dust, the rain held back until
_t_l'ie last match had been played.
 Lose Three Men ,
. Three of the sixv Panthers who
‘took part in the match, played
their last match on the Stadium
courts as members of the varsity.
They are Captain John O’Loughlin,
former Captain Byron Baur and
John Lauler. All three of these
‘en have aided in upholding the
bandards of the Pitt athletic teams
on the tennis courts, and will be
tﬁmbered in years to come.
-‘Baur, a‘ real champion, playing

form. ‘His stroking was better

He forced his opponent al-
most at pleasure, winning 6-0, 6-2.

Captain O’Loughlin, although
starting out in great form to win
the first set 6-1, hurt his leg, and
though he played every point hard,
he tired after giving one of the
gamest exhibitions seen here this
xeason, and lost the next two sets,

year,

Ilauler, also playing his last
match on the ‘varsity, played in
rare form, defeating Metzner 6-2,
6-8. Cable," too, played well to win
easily 6-2, _6-3. ~ ~

Wunderlich and Westervelt also
won their individual matches in
straight sets. _

Inpthe doubles, Baur and Cable
teamed together to beat the first
two men on the State team easily
6-3, 6-0. The State men failed to
take advantage of easy shots and

addon and Westervelt were forced
to three sets before they could de-
feat the Blue and White opponents
3-6, 6-1, 6-3.

0’Loughlin Tires

The best match of the day was
the last doubles match between
Lauler and O’Lou hlin of Pitt and
_Metzner and Hink e of State. The

match was played after the gal-
lery had tired and gone away. The
layers were very tired, but

’Loughlin having lost his singles
match wished to redeem himself
and stretched the match until at one
time it seemed that the Pitt team
would win. The State men won the
first set, 10-8, but only to lose the
second, due to the superb playing of
the Pitt captain, 5-7. But O’Lough-
lin was through at the end of this
set; his bad foot and the strain of
the lay was too much for him to
continue at such a strenuous pace.
The State team won the last set, 6-2.
The ﬁnal score of the match was
Pitt, 7; State, 2. _ .

The Panthers will Journey to New

they wil meet Westminster in their
ﬁnal match of the year.

While a student at Hamilton Col-
Institute, the premier
preparatory school of Canada, he
was champion of the Maple Leaf
territory. In his last year at the In-
stitute he migrated to Stagg Field,
Chicago, and" won the inter-national
scholastic pole vault event with a
vault of 12 feet 6 inches, besides
placing second in-the javelln throw
and third in the quarter-mile classic.

“Pick” entered Pitt in the fall of
1925. As a member of Coach Shea’s
yearling spike team his perform-
ances stood out like a brilliant star
at night. Pickard defeated all his
rivals that year besides establishing
a new university mark for his spe-
cialty with a vault of 12 feet 6
inches. Last year he entered the
Ohio Relays and won the pole vault,
establishing a new conference rec-
ord of 13 feet. Later ‘in the season
he won his specialty event at the
Penn Relays with a mark equalling
his vault in the- Ohio classic.-At the
inter-collegiates held at Philadelphia
late in the spring he had several
bad breaks and was forced to accept
third place at a height of 12 feet 9
inches.

At the close of last year's season
Pickard broke his favorite pole, and
has been unable to obtain one strong
enough to support his weight with-
out being so heavy that it hampers
his vaultin . On several occasions
this year “ ick” has cleared 14 feet
only to knock the bar off with his
arms as the pole bent under his
weight. But regardless of this great
handicap “Pick” set a new Univer-
sity record this year with a vault
of 13 feet 1°74’. inches, beating his old
mark ‘of 12 feet 6 inches by 8%
inches. He placed third in the Ohio
Relays staged this year with a vault
of 12 feet 8 inches. In the Penn
Relay Carnival he placed second to
Sabin Carr of Yale, world's cham-
pion pole vaulter. At the inter-col-
legiates held at Cambrid e, Massa-
chusetts, Pickard placed t ird, bow-
ing only to the world’s two most
sensational performers, Sabin Carr of
Yale and Lee Barnes of Southern
California. Pickard gained third
place honors at 12 feet 6 inches. ‘

During his career as a vaulter
“Pi_cl_<’.’4 has never. been beaten.-in—.a
dual meet, and has always placid
among the ﬁrst three in every meet
that he has participated in. Besides
his athletic achievements Pickard
has shyl stepped into the glare of
ﬁle lime- ight on numerous occasions
during his stay at Pi-tt. He is a
member of Omicron Delta Kappa, a
Druid, Junior and Senior Councilor
of Student Council, president of the
freshman and sophomore classes of
the Business Administration School,
president of the Business Adminis-
tration Association, and president of
Kappa Sigma, social fraternity.

Pickard will leave for Canada at
the termination of this semester to
complete his training, previous to his
trip to Amsterdam, Holland, where
he will re resent King ‘George's.
‘Maple Le Province’ in the -1928
Ogmpics.

the elimination of various non var-
sity and freshman team members
who aspired to show up the teams.
However this class still has several
survivers who should make a credit-
able showing.

competition and will be forced to
surrender his title without a struggle
to the winner of the tournament.

began yesterday and will end tomor-
row evening. The following rounds
will be run off as quickly as possible.
The ﬁnals of the tournament will be

JUNIATA BOWS TO
PANTHER COURTMEN

Juniatians Take Only o...
Doubles Match From
Stephens" Men ‘ 3

The Blue and Gold net men scored
a decisive victory over Juniata Col-
lege last week by a score’ of 5-1.The
Juiiiatians won only one doubles
match and never threatened serious-
ly. Both teams played unusually
good tennis, although they were
troubled somewhat by a high wind
which was blowing through the sta-
dium. -

Baur led off for the Panthers with
an easy victory, 6-2, 6-2.~ Then John
O’Lough1in wonover Augstadt in.
straight sets. Cable gave an ‘un-
usual performance in his match, be-
ing very erratic in the first set, yet
winning, 8-6; he settled down in the
second-set, winning it by a love
score and allowing his opponent only
four points. ‘Then Lauler added to
the slaughter with a victory over
Ellis,_6-1, 6-3. -

In the doubles matches Juniata
made a more creditable showing.
The Pitt team, Cable and Baur, took
theﬁrst set of their—match,- 6-2, but
they weakened ‘late in the second
set after having held the lead, 4-1,
and the Indians took the lead after
the ﬁfteenth game. -. The Panthers
again rallied to win two more games
and again gain the lead, but after

the Indians had won the next game, »

when it had gone twenty points, the
Panthers, discouraged, lost the set,
9-11. The deciding "match was won
by_ the Panthers after a tough bat-
tle, 6-4. The Juniatians, Auistadt
and Ellis, defeated Wunderlic, and
Westervelt in the ﬁnal match of the
in straight‘ sets, 6-2, 6-2. ‘

1929 BIG FOURATILT. _

Panther Trackers Anticipate
Regaining Title In
Tech Bowl

After setting sexieral dates and

‘places for the Big Four meet next

year the authorities have ﬁnally de-
cided to hold the annual Tri-state
carnival at the Carnegie Tech bowl.
it had been previously decided to
stage this yearly tussel of the
neighboring rivals at Washington,
with Washington and Jefferson as
the hosts, but‘ due to the inadequacy
of the Washington facilities, the
meet has deﬁnitely been placed in
the hands of Coach Steffen of Car-
negie. ,

The outcome of the meet this year
makes the Mountaineers favorites in
the contest next year. Figuring the
outcome of the meet two weeks ago
on a 5, 3, 1, basis for first, second
and third places respectively,_ Pitt
would have beaten West Virginia by
a count of 60 to 53. But they didn't
count that way, and Coach S_hea’s
10 ﬁrst places out of an available
15, might just as well have been sec-
onds or thirds.

Pitt has a meagre chance of cop-
ping the battle" to be staged _at the.
Tartan Bowl next ear. With _the
loss of{ Captain .Gib y Welch, Pitt's
sure.-~h‘stA place man in four events,
the Panthers lose 20 points to-start
off with when Gibby gets his
diploma. And when Wi ecan passes
into the stage of a graduate, Pitt
sacriﬁces just 15 more points,‘ as
Ken is a sure winner in the 10_0,.22'0
and 440 events. Perhaps-if Wihecan
had ran the ‘440 this year the? re-

sults would not have been the same,

but then you- know Ken was trying
to break the mark for the 220-yard

vents]. 
Provided all’ the material that is
in school at present becomes varsity
realities next. season, Pitt-_will have
a cracker-jack of an outﬁt. In’ the
dashes there is Bowen who has done
94-5 ..in.the 100, 22 ﬂat in the- zao
and,'i49 flat for the 440-yard this
season,‘ and McCullough who has
been a consistent placer on this
year's outfit. In the distances there
looms great possibilities in Moore,
who is capable of trotting the mile
in 4 minutes 28 seconds, and the
two-mile in about 9 minutes 53 sec-
onds, while the middle-distances are
well taken careof by Rob Roy and
Russ Comfort, who should both run
the 880-yard grind c_onsistently.un-
der two minutes. Utter_back presents
himself as a high-‘jumper with a
record of 5 feet 11% inches. The
hurdles will be well taken" care of
E3’ four A-1 timber-toppers, namely
nobloch, Voight, Carver and Lewis.
Pickard is without a doubt the great-.
est ‘véiulter in the country with one
or two exceptions and_Don Gwynn
will bother any tri-state competition
tlxiaii presents itself in the hammer-
t row. ‘ ' _ B
Summing it all up‘ Pitt needs
weight men, broad-jumpers and sev-
eral good all-around men.

Major League 0.53:

By Charles  _
Rumor has spread about the cam-»
pus that Dick Goldberg, "star 

I

ther football player and dental‘ :.St._11-' , a
dent, has been offered 8.. tryout with ' '

CAPTURE TENTH pmcz.- 

one of the major league baseball
clubs. Two weeks ago Dick played
ﬁrst base for the Youngstown. Gen-

eral Tires when they met the ‘Home-. '

stead Grays. Jack McCallister, scouti

for the Detroit Americans, ,w.as'.a,'

spectator and seemed. very greatly
impressed by “Goldie’s” work. ’
Although the General Tires were
beaten 5-1, Goldberg. made one of
his team's few hits, and ﬁelded per-
fectly, making one magniﬁcent stop
of a hot grounder. No one knows
whether McCallister has approached
Dick or not, but last year when John
'McGraw was looking for Jewish
baseball talent, and came to Pitts-
burgh for the crucial series with the
Pirates in September, Goldberg went
out to practice with the Giants. Mc-
Graw had a few words with him and
seemed greatly impressed, but with
another year of school ahead ‘of him
Goldberg-would not consider any of-
fer whatsoever. . .
-The remarkable work of this Pitt
athlete on the diamond is not a sur-
prise to his friends. Dick lives in
New Kensington, where.’ he first
started his baseball career on the.
empty lot on the corner. When he
attended Slippery'Rock Normal .he
was the. star captain of the "school
team. Dick entered Pitt in 1924 and
played center on the freshman ‘foot-
ball team; he also played o’ii._._ the
yearling basketball team. The fol-
lowing year he received an injury
early in the football season andwas
forced to give up football for the
year. In his junior and senior years,
which he spent in the dental school,
Dick alternated at center with._Andy
Cutler on the varsity. «He will be-re-l
membered by the Leland Stanford
team which met the Panthers...-on
New Year’s day. Goldberg rushed
into the game at the crucial moment
and succeeded in aiding the teamto
hold the Westerners when they were
only a few yards from the goa_l.’ Now
Dick is through with his foot_ba¥l§'
it is probable that he will never play
again as it is too great a risk for’”a’
good baseball player to take. M ’ ’
Last summer‘ Goldie played "’fi_i‘s't‘
base for Beltzhoover in '_tli‘e"'coun’ty7

any. other player in the," l|e'aguy’z‘¥,.hi_t-'
tingover .600 for the st-,'as_q“‘ V 
having almost a per_fect";ﬁelcﬁ_ng
average. This year he .isjpla'yi'__ng for
the Beaver Falls Elks _'a1'1(l‘_th§.
Beltzhoover teams.  _. ‘ ‘

Dickis graduating next month and
will have plenty of ti_me'_}to';dgyote;'
to his baseball, if he pi;e'fers’to go;
on with it rather than"dentistr‘y.

Goldberg is also active on the
campus -in ifon-athletic ‘a'ct‘ivitiés.'-'~He
