Frances Berry spoke at a lecture
sponsored by Carlow College
yesterday.

Berry is a published author and
a professor of history and law at

Howard University in Washing-‘

ton D.C. She was named ”Wom-
an of the Year” by Ms. Magazine
last year. .

Berry is also one of the leaders
of the movement to. free South
Africa. She and 2 other members

of the U.S. Commission on Civil
Rights were fired by President
Reagan in 1983 for being out-
spoken critics of the civil _rights
policies of the Reagan administra-
tion. However, a Federal District
Court reinstated her and she" was
later re-approved by Congress.
Berry also served as U.S. Assis-
tant Secretary in the Department

of Health, Education and Welfare _

from 1977 to 1980 where she su-

Cliffe Knechtle held discus-
sions outside the Towers on Mon-
day and Tuesday and will
continue them on the Soldiers
and Sailors lawn on Thursday and
Friday. He will also appear at
David Lawrence Auditorium on
Thursday night.

Knechtle, who was invited here

— by the Coalition for Christian

call people to commit their lives
to him.” He added, ”My desire

the amending process that the
Constitution changed and those
who were not included became
part of the-Constitution,” she
said.

”We have to concentrate on

civil rights so that what we do

have to share we will share more
equally,” Berry said.

”As I stand here today there are
still colleges and universities that
discriminate on the" basis of race
and sex and still receive federal
funds,” she said.

Knechtle holds a history degree
from Davidson College and a
master's degree in divinity from
Gordon-Conwell Theological
Seminary. He works for lntervar-
sity Fellowship by speaking on
university campuses.

The discussions feature five to I

10 minutes of Knechtle speaking,
followed by a question. and an-
swer session that lasts approxi-
mately two hours.

In reaction todebate sparked at
the discussions, Knechtle said:
’’I’m not out to try to manipulate
or try to shove anything down

someone’s throat. If there is an.

honest objection, I appreciate it
and try to ask questions as _to
what they believe and why.”

He added: ’’People are entitled
to their own belief; I just hope
people respect my right to dis-
agree. I respect a person's right to
do with that evidence what they
choose.”

Several ‘people had praise for
Knechtle’s presentation because
of his philosophical approach.

He said, "I approach the topic I.

through definite human needs

and seek to challenge people *

philosophically.”
Gregory Sysyn, a Pitt sopho-

more and one of the many peo- ’

ple who gathered to listen to

Knechtle said, ’’I think he is a _ 

responsible persuader and have
no objections to [his] being here
because he is willing to Iistento

other people. You don't see that .

in other persuaders.”
Another spectator, Adam Oren-
stein Sr., said, ’’I found him rather

interesting. ‘He didn't answer a j r T ".55

question I asked towards Judaism
straightfowardly. I expected a

deeper, answer.” Orenstein ad-_   
ded, ’’I think Knechtle’s reason?  "

for being here is to answer ques-
tions — and perhaps make us be-
lieve in Jesus.” -

U.S. researcher wins Nobel prize for formula

By Cecilia Lonnell
Associated Press Writer

STOCKHOLM, Sweden — American
researcher Robert M. Solow on Wednes-
day won the Nobel Memorial Prize in
Economic Sciences for explaining how
certain factors work together to make an
economy grow.

Solow, of the Massachusetts Institute of
-Technology in Cambridge, Mass., won
the prize for a mathematical formula pub-
lished in 1956 that demonstrated how fac-
tors like savings, capitaI,'technoIogy and
labor affect a nation’s economic future.

In awarding the prize, the Royal Swed-
ish Academy of Sciences cited him for
”his contributions to the theory of eco-
nomic growth.” -

A native of Brooklyn, N.Y., Solow was
the 15th American to win the prizesince

it was created by the Bank of Sweden in .

1968. ‘ .
Last year, James M. Buchanan of Ge-
orge Mason University, Fairfax, ,\/a.,

received the prize for basic work on the
theory of decision—making.

Asked about the reasons for the vola-
tility in the stock market, Solow, blamed

”’the combination ofthe baIance-of-

payments deficit and the federal budget
deficit, which has put our country in the
position of financing a 8 consumption
boom by borrowing from foreigners.”
He said from his home in Boston
”we’re going to be a number of years dig-
ging ourselves out of a hole that we dug
for ourselves over the past six or seven
years.” .

Solow, a member of the President's
Council of Economic Advisers under John
F. Kennedy and a proponent of govern-
ment regulation of the economy, criti-
cized the Reagan administration for its

. refusal to raise taxes to combat the deficit. I

The 63-year-old professor was among
the first to recognize the role technoIo_gi-

  

cal, progress plays in bolstering -the

Assar Lindbeck, president of the Nobel
committee which chose the laureate, said
that by the 1960s, SoIow’s work had in-
fluenced countries to concentrate more
resources on.universities and research.

To this day, the World Bank and
economists in countries around the globe
use SoIow’s theories when projecting na-
tional growth, Lindbeck said. _

Solow was the second MIT scientist to
win a Nobel Prize this year. Susumu
Tonegawa, a Japanese researcher, won
the prize for medicine last week.

SoIow’s work showed that even though .

in the short run a country can reach a
higher level of growth by increased sav-

ings, technology and capital determine

the long-range growth . rate.

Solow has devoted the last decade to
researching macroeconomics, or the eco-
nomic policies of nations, especially un-
employment. He also is involved in
research on_ the optimal use of natural
resources‘ and , the. environment,

Senate delays action on Reagan's gulf policy  

 

WASHINGTON — The Senate
Wednesday voted to delay for
two months any action on Presi-
dent Reagan's Persian Gulf poli-

cy, including the reflagging of -

Kuwaiti tankers.

In a series of parliamentary
procedures that one senator
deemed ”confusing,” a resolu-

‘ tion was approved calling for the

president to provide the Senate
with a detailed report on his poli-
cy in 30 days.

After it receives the report, the
Senate has 30 days to decide
whether it likes what the presi-
dent has been doing.

The move means critics of Rea-
gan’s policy, who had been

- demanding that the War Powers

Act be invoked, have temporari-

' ly. lost in their struggle to have
‘ their way.

A similar measure is being con-

.I sidered in the House but has not

been voted on yet.
American economist

STOCKHOLM, Sweden -
Massachusetts Institute of Tech-
nology Professor Robert M.

Solow won the 1987 Nobel Eco-
nomics Prize Wednesday, be-
coming the 15th American to win
the Economics prize in the
award’s 18-yearhistory.

Solow, 63, a native of New
York, was an economic advisor to
President Kennedy and President
Johnson.

The award carries a cash prize
of $340,000.

The Royal Swedish Academy
of Sciences announced they
decided on Solow because of his
”contributions to the theory of
economic growth."

The Academy said Solow
”created a theoretical framework
which could be used in the study
of factors which permit produc-

tion growth and increased
welfare.”

inquiries by news organizations
and attempts to question Reagan
during picture—taking sessions.

Fitzwater said Reagan did not
have any particular announce-
ments to make. He also said he
doubted that Reagan would have
any word on a possible date for
a new summit with Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev.

Reagan has had few formal
news conferences since the Iran-
Contra affair surfaced in early
November 1986. He met with
reporters at the White‘ House on
Nov. 19, 1986, then did not hold
another news conference there
until March 19. /

His latest session with report-
ers occurred at the end of the
seven-nation economic summit
in Venice, Italy, on June 11.

Since then, the president has
granted interviews to individual
journalists and news organi-
zations. '

Asked whether Reagan would
be prepared. to answer questions
about the Iran-Contra affair, Fitz-
water said there would be no
limitation on subjects.

Editor's Note: The following
article is part IV in a series of five
analytical articles dealing with ra-
cial prejudice at the University of
Pittsburgh.

PART IV
IN A SERIES

The University of Pittsburgh
has been criticized relentlessly —
as have been most other major,

ij

THE PITT NEWS, Tuhursiday, ociobergzz, 1987,  to

public universities — for its lack
of sufficient facilities, both social
and academic, for black students.

”There aren't specific functions
for black students on campus,”
said Curt Toll, chairman of the
Governmental Relations Commit-
tee, a standing committee of the
Student Government Board.

’’In promoting unity, I realize
the needs of black students are
different. But any steps we take
should not be exclusive.

”For instance, as chairman of
the GRC, when we examined
divestment, we were very quick
to bring in the BAS and other or-
ganizations,” said Toll.

Toll, speaking as a fellow stu-

‘ dent, said he believes the most

important course of action a
black student — or any student,
for that matter — should take is
to get involved.

However, some students feel
that too much attention is already
being paid to needs of black stu-
dents on campus.

’’I think the Black Action Soci-

ety gets far too much money for ‘

the amount of students they
represent. I don't understand
that,” said a Pitt biology student
who did not want to be named.

Perhaps the fact that he did not
want to be named could be

blamed for part of the problem
that persists between black and
white students — a lack of com-
munication. Many are simply not
willing to come forth and state
what they believe, listen to the
other’s point of view and attempt
to clear up misconceptions that
exist.

”The Student Government
Board has to work with the BAS,”
said Toll. ”But too many times,
you get misunderstandings.”

As for the Black Action Socie-
ty's allocations, it is true that they
are considered a governance or-
ganization, which means they are
one of the nine largest, represen-

Communication may be key to linkingraces

tative groups on campus.

According to their Constitution, A

one of the goals of their admin-
stration is to enhance communi-
cations between the black

student body and the black com- A ” T

munity.

Should they also institute a
policy to better communication
with the white student body,
would it be an effective oath, or
an unnecessary one? .

Next Week: Part V of the ser-
ies will conclude with a meeting

of both black and white students, . 
and suggestions they _make to g

each other on closing the gap be-
tween the races. g

to the great rewards of later life.
Men change less dramatically,
and it doesn't have to be between
50 and 55 — in fact, the age for
the change is hard to pinpoint be-
cause it is different for each man.

As a man senses some changes
in his general vigor, including his
sexual vigor, he may react mild-
ly instead of melodramatically -
especially if his life in general is

interesting and rewarding. A real
difference between menopause
and so-called male menopause is
that women lose the ability to
conceive children (nearly always
with some feeling of relief) and
men can go on impregnating
women. If they lose their in-
seminating ability, it happens
without much relationship to
those panicking feelings of pass-
ing from youth to age.

 THE PITT NEWS

HAPPY BIRTHDAY wPTs!
 Station celebrates
with bigtime bash

By Joel Timulak
For The Pitt News

  

On Saturday night, WPTS will light three candles on its non-
commercial birthday cake and everyone is invited to. celebrate the
third year of Pitt's radio station as they host four Pittsburgh bands.

Johnny Rhythm & the Dimestore 45's, the Clarks, 11th Hour and
The Affordable Floors will be plugging in -and tuning up on the
stage of the William Pitt Union Assembly Room at 7:30 p.m. Tick-
ets are available for $5 inadvance at the WPU Ticket Office and
for $6 at the door the night of the bash.

WPTS was born at 6 p.m. on Aug. 26, 1984, to the tune of Fri-
da’s single ”There’s Something Going On.” its earlier beginnings
were in 1961 as WPGH, an AM station that broadcasted to Pitt
and Carlow campuses.

WPGH was a groundbreaker during the late '60s renaissance,
which introduced psychedelia and saw the emergence of metal.
WPGH continued to broadcast until 1984. It was in 1984 that the
FCC granted Pitt an FM license, and WPGH—AM changed to WPTS-
FM with 10 watts of power. '

It comes as no surprise that WPTS is hosting four local bands
for its birthday bash. Since its genesis, Pitt's radio station has been
the airwaves haven for local bands, independent and progressive
music in Pittsburgh. , '

”We believe in the music we play, especially by bands in our
area,” said stationmanager Bradley Freeman, ”PTS has and will
continue to support our local music.” ’

Because WPTS is a non-commercial station, it doesn't have to
attract advertisers with a money-making format and playlists. It is
free to shelve the stagnant brands of pop music being played by
larger stations nowadays. - ,

WPTS is a forum for bands that are much_ like the station itself:
- independent, creative and exciting. The station is completely run
by Pitt students who manage business affairs, record their own pub-
lic service announcements and promos and design their own
shows. ,

”| workhere about 20 hours a week without pay,” said promo-
tions director Lynn Dobrinick. ”On the whole, we love the music
we play, and we're excited about the station and our birthday.”

WPTS will include 11th Hour as one of the three bandsplaying
at its birthday party. As a live band, they are intense and exciting.
A few weeks back, they broke a paid attendance record among
Pittsburgh's rock clubs. That show at the Upstage confirmed
manager Mike Whited’s suspicion that 11th Hour is breaking new
ground in Pittsburgh's rock scene.

”They are the most exciting band from Pittsburgh to come
around for quite a while,” he said.

it had to be expected. Their last
LP, Life's Rich Pageant, was the
first R.E.M. album to be certified
as gold. International Record Syn-
dicate, the band's record compa-
ny, subsequently blitzed the
media in an attempt to find an
American rival to U2.

The last time the foursome
from Athens, Ga., visited Pitts-
burgh, they played to a packed
house at the Syria Mosque. On
Friday, they continue their climb

arriving in record stores with a
plethora of posters, flyers and op-
timistic sales forecasts.

But the band apparently hasn't
given in to the temptations of
pop-music stardom.

Document features a diverse
mixture of songs that boast a
tougher guitar sound. But while
Peter Buck's guitar may have got-
ten. louder and more distorted,
Michael Stipe’s vocals are more
understandable than ever before.

Stipe uses his vocal cords as an
extra instument on stage and has
been criticized frequently in the
past for his unintelligible perfor-
mances.

It's fortunate that we can final-
ly understand him on this album
because he is arguably the most
articulate poet in pop music;

close-ups of Whitney Houston's

”|t’s the End of the World As
We Know It (And I Feel Fine)”
promises to get the most com-
mercial airplay off of the new al-
bum and should be a neat live
performance.

Stipe’s sarcastic portrayal of
Americana matches Bob Dylan's
”Subterranean Homesick Blues”
in style and form and surpasses
it in energy. '_ -

doesn't necessitate the use of a
form of the word ”jangle” i_n
reviews, due to Buck's increased
fervor on guitar.)

When R.E.M. performs live,
Stipe shrieks and snarls through
most of the vocals, marring the
sophisticated lyrics. But the sub-
sequent raw power and harmony
that results is a sound distinct to
R.E.M.

Buck and Stipe seem to try to
outdo each other on stage, often
thrashing around, trying to hog
up the limelight. But the band is
best when all four members stand
still and harmonize.

Last year, Camper Van
Beethoven opened for R.E.M. at
the Syria Mosque and contrasted
Pink Floyd-ish psychedelia

Stipe even contributes a guest _ "P 1
vocal in ”A Campfire Song” on

10,000 Maniacs latest -LP In My

The band admits to sounding :-

better live than on vinyl because
of their simple melodies and har-
monies. Vocalist Natalie Mer-
chant has been quoted as saying
her band "moves people rather
than records.”

10,000 Maniacs’ second album

hasn't had much success on com- 7

mercial radio but has been popu-
lar with the college crowd, which
is R.E.M.’s mainstay audience.

Kellee Van Aken a Hry Bouvy appear

in the Stuo production of Spring Awakening.

Victorian drama opens '87-'88
season at University Theatre

By Susan Washburn

. Entertainment Editor

As the cool weather of fall de-

‘cends upon the campus, the

uni-versity theater opens its
'87-'88 season with the produc-
tion of Spring Awakening in the
Studio Theater. _
Set in the Victorian age, this

_' searing drama exposes the op-

pression society placed on the
budding sexuality of adoles-
cence.-The subject matter deals
not only with the repression of
-sexual desire but also explores
the problems of child abuse and
the lack of education regarding
sex. I

The script contains a number of 8
images and themes and allows

the director to choose the ele-

use,”

ments he feels are most im-
portant.

”There are. so many images and
themes present in the text, you
can focus on what youwant to
said director Peter
Harrigan. -

In addition to his directing
responsibilities, Harrigan has
taken on the duty of costume
designer for the show as well.

He has ‘chosen to use a mixture
of Victorian and modern dress in

the production as a constant

reminder that the problems are
not obsolete.

”Boys will wear. Converse
high-tops, teachers will have mi r-
rored sunglasses, and modern
props occasionally appear to re-
mind us that the moral residue of
the Victorian era was with us for

a long time,” added Harrigan.

Spring Awakening uses very
mature subject matter to arouse
social consciousness and may not
be appropriate for all audiences.
However, the message is striking.

’’I’m not a person with a ‘social
conscience,’ but I am ‘socially
conscious,’ and in studying this
play, I was struck with how much
relevance it has today,” com-
mented Harrigan.

Coming up later in the season
at the university theater are

> Educating Rita and The Misan-
~thrope at Stephen Foster as well

as Baby at the Studio Theatre.
Spring Awakening previews

Oct. 23 to 25 and runs Oct. 28.

through Nov. 8. For information

1 1th Hour has been together for about a year. Singer/guitarist Shawn
Harrison, bassist Rod Schwartz and singer‘/lead guitarist Dave Mitch-
ell, however, played as a cover band at Indiana University of Penn-
sylvania. Together with former drummer Ken Gregg, the band won
the 1987 Tri-State Rock Competition held earlierthis year.

11th Hour performed ”battle of the bands” style for about eight
weeks with 30 or so other groups and were awarded first place —
the prize being‘ a fully produced album by Gamut Studios in Latrobe
and distribution by the independent A.W.O.L. label. Gregg has since
left the band to go to the West Coast and was replaced by Jerry Gol-
denson, a drummer they feel is quite suitable to their style. While
playing live, the band is working on songs to record this winter-in
Latrobe.

11th Hour is a rock ’n’ roll band in the traditional sense. Rich vo-
cal harmonies and inspired guitar landscapes provide the backdrop
for emotional and thoughtful lyrics. ‘ _ A

”We don't aim at a particular audience,” said Dave Mitchell who,
to this point, has shared songwriting duties with Shawn Harrison. The
band agrees that they are different from most groups because their

songs and performances have a good deal of emotional content, and’

they are founded on a five—year friendship.

”We don't want to be exclusively a political band. There's a lot
to be said for good rock ’n’ roll that's both socially conscious and
danceable,” said Harrison. ’’Personally, I'm inspired by the lack of
good music on, major stations.” One of Shawn's songs, ”There’s No
Danger,” is about the current state of radio and the stilted record com-
panies. '

The band is restoring energy and emotional honesty to Pittsburgh's
music scene. It is notable that 11th Hour has attracted the ears of
Cheetah Chrome, who will produce their first album. Chrome was
a member of the Dead Boys, one of the original punk bands of the
late '70s, and knows about high—energy music himself.

WPTS has been playing the bands soon-to-be-released six-song EP
with great enthusiasm; in fact, WPTS was the first to play 1 1th Hour.
Rod Schwartz explained the band's looking forward to Saturday
night's Birthday Bash. ”|t_'s a way of thanking the station for playing
us when nobody else would. Come and see us live,” he said.

Giving the insane

room to manuever

The Senate approved a plan that would give Reagan an.ex-
tra 60 days before making a decision regarding his Persian Gulf
policy. The move, at this point, seems to be nothing but dan-
gerous.

In the recent past, Reagan has had a remarkably poor record
of making reasonable policy decisions. The decision to secret-
ly fund the Contras, to trade arms for hostages, to nominate
a candidate for the Supreme Court that the senate ”would like
even less” and his refusal to give the Arias Peace Plan a chance
to work, all, in our opinion, point to a man out of touch with
anything but his own agenda. ‘

It is certainly troublesome to think that the same president

who admitted that the_ Grenada invasion was -good for hi_s
 popularity, who feels thlatthe Soviets are all liars and cheats,

will be given further lattitude in one of the most volatile places
in the world. Any senatorial restraint of Reagan's military hon-

choism is long overdue.

In a nutshell 

As I climb into my mistress’

yard

I am thinking about howlarge

the world is

And about how I have been lost

in it.

Thursday, October 22, I987, '

 

My grandmother told me her
mother had put five dollars in the
bank one week, and the next
week, she lost it.

Though she was only 12 when
the Depression followed the
Great Crash of 1929, she recalls
it well enough to tell me that she
knew of a druggist (she told me
his name, but I don't remember

' it) who lost all of hisirstockand

shot himself. '~

”It didn't kill him, though,” she
said.

She's often wondered when
another great depression would
happen again. ,

People are just now beginning
to reflect upon what conse-
quences might have been
suffered by Americans if not for
the upswing of stock on Tuesday.
This time, the reaction to the pan-
ic on Wall Street wasdelayed. It
was just an afterthought, this
time.

While still wobbly, the market
is stabilizing, according to the
latest report I referred to from the
Associated Press.

”Nobody seems to be worried
about it. They just say, ‘Gee, did
you hear about what's happening
on Wall Street,’ and it's pretty
much just a good piece of small
talk,” said my grandmother.

 

 

FRANCES
SANSIG

Because most of us have never
lived through the dire times of an
economic oppression, there is
truly no way we can comprehend
the impact it had on_those poor
souls who fared it.

If the United States were to col-
lapse into a state of financial ruin

today, it is difficult to speculate ~

what might evolve from it. Before
this, those who chose to be con-
cerned with the state of the world
were preoccupied with the threat
of thermonuclear warfare. The
plunge in the Dow—Jones indus-
trial average made us turn our
heads for a second and will cause

some to look the other way for a

while. .
When the news was first report-

ed, Ithought to myself, as I’m_

sure others did, that another

depression was not possible. It _ _
just could not“ happen. I didn't '

think twice about it, until I spoke
with _my grandmother.

If I had to choose between a , 

third world war and a depression,

I do think a depression would be-
.the lesser of the two evils.

On surviving the big crash

It definitely would not mean" ‘  l

the end of the world, and though I J 3“ . ;
destruction would be inevitable, .

to some extent, it would not near-
ly reach the proportions of hu-

man tragedy that'would be  

brought about by a war.

The depression probably made
the people who inhabit this coun-
try stronger —— it taught them how
to survive, and that is a chance
they would most likely forfeit'if

an ICBM were launched.
It made us better equipped to .

deal with pending problems and
gave us a stronger foundation
upon which to build a format for
preventing future disaster to the
best of our ability. ‘

Another depression would be a
hardship to endure. But I don't
think it'll kill anybody, though.

It's all just a matterof political trust, really

In national politics, unlike most
other areas, the word is truth.
What is said (at least by enough
of the right people)  is. Rumors

spread, become truth and then ,

justify themselves. Examples are
everywhere. Take an article of
faith in presidential politics ——
that Mondale lost to Reagan be-
cause he projected an image of
”weakness” or ”pessimism.”
Once this perception had taken
hold, there was nothing Mondale
could do to shake it off. Every
word, every action was interpret-
ed as the words and actionsof a
weak man, a loser. Who knows
if the initial perception was ever
grounded in reality? Perceptions
find their own truth. Was Mon-

I .daIe.. really?  .ttaeLe.9.€2§!tit1seait?.

”realist”? His fate depended on
his image, and his image was in
the hands of the imagemakers --
determined by the fanciful imagi-
nation of a news media bent on
deliveringdefinition at all costs,
whether the cost be one man's
political aspirations or a nation's
future.

Or another article of faith —
that the America of the '80s has
been rejuvenated, that it can now
walk tall, i_n pride. B-ut of "what
does this pride consist? Do we
command more respect? Do we

A really think better of ourselves?

Do we feel we have fewer

problems, better prospects? None ‘

of these are true.’ Our pride is just

other, reciting it before bedtime
until weall believe it, and truth
(or at least truth's appearance) has
been created.

It's the emperor's new clothes

- in new clothes. Jesse Jackson can-

not hope to win the presidency.
Why? Because no one believes
he can hope to win the presiden-
Cy. It has nothing to do with his
competency, his knowledge, his
experience or the sophistication

;.and compassion of his v_is_io'r_i for


 
   

     

believe he doesn't have a hope?
Because "that's what everyone
says — from the pundits on
down. Saying makes it so, reality
be damned. ’

Sometimes, saying does make
it so. Famously, Descartes exist-
ed simply because he thought he
did. ,But what was he? Just
thought itself. Thinking cannot by
itself create the world and neither
can saying — not _unless we allow
ourselves to be deceived, unless
we allow other’s shallow words
to create ourown reality.

The rumors, the images and
ideology — they all have to start
somewhere. They‘ start in the

minds of those who wishito con- ’.

trol the tides of political _fortune,

through the commentators, jour- ‘
nalists and television waves; it y I‘ ‘
flows into our homes "and into. ' A

stand the system, the .self- — - 

sustaining power of political
demagoguery, and intend to use
it, manipulating our perceptions

from behind the cloak of impar- »_
tiality and objectivity. Why do.

they say that Jesse Jackson cannot
win? Because they know it will

destroy his chances, the chant-  ‘

taken up and repeated in an ever-
swelling chorus by the mindless

_masses,'those like you and I, for

whom truth is determined by ver-

Panthers hope Navy won't rock the boat

year, so a change had to be
made. Enter Uzelac.

Uzelac has not been able to
turn the tide this season as Navy
enters this week's game with the
Panthers at 1-5, including losses
to William and Mary and Lehigh.

By Sam Tallarico
Sports Editor

Things have not been going too
well for the Naval Academy foot-
ball program the past few sea-
sons. The fact is, it has already
made last year's head coach,
Gary Tranquill, walk the plank.

Tranquill, 20-34-1 in his five
years at the Academy, was
relieved of his coaching duties
last December after compiling a
3-8 record for 1986 and was
replaced by Elliot Uzelac, an
offensive line coach from the
University of Michigan.

Navy has not had a winning
season since 1982, when the
team went 6-5 in Tranquil|’s first

fried, however, is still concerned
about-the Midshipmen and re-
fuses to take them lightly.
”We’ve_ learned enough les-
sons ourselves, and we don't look
at the scores,” said Gottfried,

this season.

”They have improved the last
couple of weeks,” said Gottfried.
”They’re the first wishbone team
we've faced since I've been here.

Panther head coach Mike Gott- T"

referring to Navy's performance '

We did not play the option well
against Notre Dame, and l’m
concerned.”

Freshman quarterback Alton
Grizzard will get the starting nod
for Navy, despite the fact that he's
only completed seven of 23 pass-
es (30.4 completion percentage)
for 93 yards, two interceptions
and one touchdown. ’

He has, however, 308 yards
rushing on 64 carries (4.8 yards
per carry) for four touchdowns.
Uzelac feels it's only a matter of
time before Grizzard is able to
take command of the offense. V

”_A|ton Grizzard is our quarter-
back now [over senior John
Nobers]. He never ran the wish-
bone before, so he's still learning

it. He played a good game at
Pennsylvania [Navy's only win of
the season, 38-28, last week] and
is getting‘ better and better. He
has a better grasp of the offense,”
said Uzelac. -

”He has rushed for quite a few
yards, but he's still making fresh-
man mistakes,” he added.

V Grizzard’s 308 yards is second
on the team to senior fullback
_Chuck Smith. Smith, who rushed
for 91-O yards last season and has
364 yards on only 72 carries this
season (5.1 yards per carry), will
not see action due to a bad knee
sprain.

Uzelac feels his team's lack of
experience is one of the main rea-
sons why the team has not been

_ The Pitt Panthers conducted another basketball practice at Fitzger-
ald Field House yesterday, but Demetreus Gore had the day off. ,
Gore, a 6—foot—5 guard/forward, has been sidelined with a severely
sprained right ankle suffered in a pickup game in mid—September.
Gore said he thought his worst nightmare had come true when he
went down with the injury. ”I was really worried. I was almost posi-
tive I broke it.”

He's missed all of Pitt's official practices, which began.a weekago,
and is expected to be out for at least another week.

”It’s hurting [Gore] a lot. We're trying to move him to a new posi-
tion (off—gua,rd)_._The biggest thing l’m wor_ried about is his condition-
ing,” said Pitt coach Paul Evans. ‘

Gore, who usually tips the scales at a svelte 197 pounds, has ad-
ded on 20 pounds. ' '

”|’ve been doing a lot of eating. Not being in practice makes it
tough to keep my weight down, but I don't think [the weight] will
hurt me. I feel stronger,” said Gore.

While Gore can only shoot jump shots and layups on one of the
second level practice floors at the Field House, Evans is on the main
court, grooming freshman Darelle Porter and Jason Matthews, who
will backup'Gore at the off-guard spot — once he gets healthy.

”I could be back right now ifthis was during the season. But I don't
want to take any chances. I want to make sure the ank|e’s complete-
ly healed before I come back,” said Gore.

Gore said he's thankful the injury didn't occur to his left ankle be-

6 cause that's the ankle he almost always jumps off.

And after three up and down seasons Gore knows he can't afford
an injury. This is the year he wants to display his whole package.
The package which Pitt fans saw two years ago when Gore was a
sophomore and Pitt's top scorer and arguably the team's best player.

But last season Gore played small forward where his duties included
more than scoring. Gore was asked to rebound the basketball. And,
when he didn't rebound, Evans didn't hesitate to call on a real 6-foot-5
player — Rod Brookin. (While Gore is listed in the Pitt media guide

One of the truly great rivalries

is to watch a game —.- South
Bend, Ind. The Fighting Irish take
on University of Southern

In recent years, only the inten-

classic rivalry have kept the game
from being a yawner, as both pro-
grams slipped in national promi-
nence.

Both teams are also coming off
very’ impressive wins. Notre
Dame overpowered a solid Air

at 6-foot-5, he admits he's closer to 6-3.)

Gore's troubles rebounding led to more time on the bench. He only

averaged 26 minutes played per game.

The decrease in playing time put more pressure on Core to produce

while he was in the game.

His scoring average plummeted to 12.9 points per game from 16.1
his sophomore year, and his shooting percentage dropped from 55

percent to 45.

’’I put too much pressure on myself last year. I was pressing. This
year I'm going to let it all hang out. I want to showcase what I can
do because this is it. I don't have any time left after this year,” Gore

said.

» ‘ This year I’m going to let it all hang out.
.— Demetreus Gore

This past summer Gore worked out with teammate Pat Cavanaugh,

concentrating on passing and defensive drills.

Evans feels Gore had a good summer, and he thinks the ill effects

:of his junior year are behind him now.

Said Evans, ’’I think Demetreus’ mind is clear. He's ready to go.
: He was in a tough situation last year, and the move back to two-guard

should help him.”

In Pitt's two NCAA tournament games against Marist and Oklaho-
ma Gore scored 39 points, playing much of the time at the off-guard

spot

guard almost exclusively.

Evans said that will be the case at least for the first four games of
the season. After the fourth game transfer Nate Bailey becomes eligi-

”I showed what I could do in the tournament. I feel much more
relaxed at off-guard, but I don't mind playing small forward, either.
I need to improve my rebounding no matter where I play,” said Gore.

But unless Brookin falters at small forward, Gore should play off-

ble, and he could push Core for some playing time.

For now, Gore just wants his ankle to heal. ”|’m anxious to get

started. I think we're going to have a real good season.”

As for his personal goals, Gore is quite modest.

”I definitely want to have a better year than I did last year.”

PANTHER NOTES: Pitt has scheduled four preseason blue/gold
scrimmages at local high schools. The Panthers scrimmage at Free-
dom High School Oct. 27, New Castle High School Nov. 4, A||iquip-
pa High School Nov. 12 and Penn Hills High School Nov. 21 
Forward Steve Maslek is out with a pulled hamstring, and Evans isn't

sure when he’l|.return.
