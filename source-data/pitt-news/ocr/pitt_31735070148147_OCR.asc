When the ﬁnal points were tallied,

Pitt shattered Carnegie Mellon

University by almost $5,000 in a
round of a game similar to “Jeop-
ardy!” and triumphed in a game of
wit and trivia. ~

‘ Well, technically Pitt came in sec-
ond place, but no one expected the
humans to win, anyway. '

The victor in the matchup was ‘

Watson, a supercomputer that
launched to fame after it dominat-
ed a special “Jeopardy!” game last
month. IBM trained the machine to
participate in the game against two

“]eopardy!”~champions, Brad Rutter
and KenJennings.— _ . _
Similar to an oversized tablet,
Watson is a 2-and-a-half by-1-foot
screen with a globe as an avatar. It is

‘ able to speak its answers in a com-

puter-animated voice. IBM brought
the machine to CMU’s campus yes-
terday, its ﬁrst stop on a brief college
tour. More than 300 people watched
as three representatives from Pitt 0
and CMU squared off against Watson
in the mock “Jeopardy!” game.
Butin an ironic twist, the focus of
the event was not the machine’s rise,
toward world dornination. ‘Rather,
the‘all—day symposium celebrated
the humans who created the ma-’
chine — which then went on to de-

feat the humans. . -

The trivia game was the culmina-
tion of the day, which began with a
conferenceoninnovative IBM Wat-
son technologies. '

Chancellor Mark Nordenberg
kicked off the event, remarking on
IBM’s technological prowess. ‘

He also lauded Pitt and CMU’s
symbiotic relationship and how it
enabled the two universities to foster
knowledge and innovation.

But the partnership didn’t stop
the game from getting a little com-
petitive. ‘ '

After the Pitt students were in-
troduced at the start of the game
— all are members of Pitt’s Honors
College ”— Randy Bryant, dean of

 

  

Watson outslnarts students

CMU’s School of Computer Science,
brought in some good, old-fashioned
trash talk.

‘We like to think our entire uni-
versity is an honors college,” he
said. . »

But the Pitt students prevailed.
Brian Sisco, Richard Kester and
Danielle Arbogast represented Pitt,
quickly answering the few questions
they could buzz in time for.

Watson answered most of the
board, but there was one category
where Pitt completely dominated the
competition: Wine, White Wine.

Luckily, Pitt’s break came during
the second round, where the value

Columnist Dan Savage speaks at Rainbow Alliance event

Amy Friedenberger
Senior Staﬁ" Writer

When Dan Savage was a child, he was con-

stantly bullied for being gay.

But then it got better.

Now happily married and with a child,
Savage is telling those part of the lesbian, gay,
bisexual, transgender and queer community
that it will get better for them, too. ,

Rainbow Alliance, a Pitt student group
that promotes the interests of the LGBTQ
community, hosted Dan Savage, a widely
syndicated sex and relationship columnist.
Savage founded the It Gets Better Project,
making it the focal point of his speech last

night in David Lawrence Hall.

More than 500 people showed up, a num-
ber that Melissa Tabak, the executive assistant
of Rainbow Alliance, said indicates how sup-
portive people are of Savage and his project.

The It Gets Better Project includes an on-
line website that offers videos from people
in the gay community who assure LGBTQ.

teenagers that life will get better for them’ ‘

despite years of bullying.

The projectbegan after a slew of teenagers, .

including 15-year-old Billy Lucas, committed
suicide because of bullying last year.
According to the 2007 Massachusetts
Youth Risk Survey, lesbian, gay and bisex-
ual youth are up to four times more likely
to attempt suicide than their heterosexual

peers.

is that he can’t picture a future of joy to com-
pensate the pain he’s in now,” Savage said; “He

might know that there are happy, gay, loved -

adults, but he doesn’t know how to get from
where he is in Greensburg, Ind., to there.”

When Savagefound a comment on Billy’s
Facebook memoriam page that said, “It gets
better,” he was inspired to ﬁnd a way to reach
out to LGBTQ teens. '

But his reputation for broaching explicit

sexual topics while speaking on college cam-

puses made itdiﬁicult for him to speak to

middle schools or high schools. : _
Instead, Savage took to a different me-
dium. With the aid of YouTube, he was able

“What Billy is saying [through his suicide] _

to convey the message that “It gets better”
to LGBTQ teens — even though he couldn’t
say it in person. _

' He asked his husband togalso take part in
the video so they could talk about how, despite

. all the bullying in their youth, they eventually

found joy.. Savage also encouraged oﬂtherslto

' contribute their own videos. .

The goal was to post 100 videos, but Savage
said he got 650 videos after only ﬁve days.

“The goalwas not to reach so many videos,
but to save lives,” Savage said. ‘ '

The It Gets Better Project includes Videos
from people such as President Barack Obama,
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Sen. A1

LATE Students rally near Union
against budget cuts

1   Staff Photographer

Gabe Morgan, the director of Pittsburgh SEIU, speaks to students and community mem-
bers outside the William Pitt Union about proposed education funding cuts.

Andrew Shull
Staff Writer

Although graduating senior Phil LaRue might not
be directly affected by the proposed 50 percent
reduction in state funds to Pitt, he had a very
personal reason to speak out yesterday against
the proposed cuts.

“Two years ago, my dad lost his job. Iftuition
spikedbyafew thousand dollars then, Iwouldn’t
have been able to ﬁnish school,” he said. ‘

LaRue sharedhis story duringastudent Gov-
ernment Board—organized rally on the porch of
the William Pitt Union yesterday afternoon The
Board organized the rally in opposition to Gov.
Tom Corbett’s budget proposal, which would
cutPitt’s state appropriations from_$167 million,
to $80.2 million. The state is currently facing a
$4.1 billion dollar budget gap, and Corbett has
pledged not to raise taxes while cutting down
on the debt. A

The rally comes aiterweeks of protests from
students and the affected schools themselves,
which say that cutting dollars for education will

programs. _ V
Duringthe rally, students, local residents and
union members joined together, chanting “sup-
port our education, the future of our nation.”
They also watched speeches detailing the ways

. in which cuts would affect members of all three

groups. ‘ .

“My goal was to give ‘students a voice,” SGB
President Molly Stieber said. Sﬁeber hosted the
event and encouraged attendees to sign peti-
tions. A A

Demonstrators reached nowhere near the
750 people who said they were attending on the
event’s_ Facebook page, but therewas alarge con-
tingentfrom the city’s various unions. About 100
people in all attended the event.

Jack Shea, president of the labor councils of
Allegheny and Fayette counties, said that unions
and students were part of the same ﬁght.

“The budgetthatjust came downwillhave an
impact on workers and our ﬁiends,” he said. He
characterized the cuts as a “backdoor tax” and
went on to say that “education should be the last
thing we tax.”

Pi Kappa Phi

Gwenn Barney
Senior Stajf Writer

An old fraternity is back in town.

1 Last night, Pi Kappa Phi fraternitywas voted
into Pitt’s Interfraternity Council as a “colony,”
ending an eight year hiatus for the Pitt chapter.

. The ﬁaternity is now on track to become a fully

chartered member of the council within the next
two years.

“We are official,” Chris Shade moments after
learning the colonization news. Shade is the ex-
pansion coordinatorfortheﬁaternitys national
organization. '

“The fact that we’re welcome by other or-
ganizations and all our hardwork was recog-
nized makes it that much_ better,” said junior
Sean Zajdel. A  j y

A The fraternity enjoyed a long run on Pitt’s
campus between 1978 and 2003. Eight years

on road to earning charter

ago, the group surrendered their charter amidst
sinking membership and rising debt. The group’s
new colony status allows fraternity members to
participate ir1 IF C events, but they can’t castvotes
on council matters. ' '

It is the only national fraternity to own and
operate a national nonproﬁt philanthropy. Since
1977, ithas owned Push America, an organization
that beneﬁts people with disabilities.

The fraternity’s current resurrection began
when Zajdel, a brother at Albright College in

. Reading, Pa., transferred to Pitt, only to ﬁnd that
his fraternity didn’t have a chapter on campus.
Zajdel didn’t arrive on Pitt’s campus planning to
beginachapter, but the topic came up in,conver-

' sation with friends. ' ‘

“Startingitwas sortofasurprise,”Zajdelsaid. A

“Itwasjustan ideal had with two or three friends.

Soon we had three to seven guys and then that

grew to 15. Now we have upwards of 30 guys.”
Pi Kappa Phi went through several steps to

become colonized by the IFC. Alter contacting
the administration and IFC leadership to spread
news of its intentions, Zajdel and his group veri- ’
ﬁed that they had more than 20 members, all
with GPAs above 2.75.

They then enlisted professorjocelyn Kauf-
funger to fulﬁll the requirement of a chapter
adviser. The brothers submitted a letter of in-
tent, statement of goals and objectives, and basic
governing documents to round out the ﬁnal step
of the application process. _

In additionto these required steps, members
of Pi Kappa Phi attended a Feb. 16 IFC meeting
to present their fraternity’s ideals and goals to
the council. V . ' V

The ﬁ°aternity is the ﬁrst to complete the
colonization process since Delta Upsilon did so

‘ about one year ago.

\ Pitt swept the board — beating Watson --
even snagging a Daily Double, where it could

But even with the group’s experience with
trivia, Kester didn’t have high expectations
for the team, especially after watching Watson
play “Jeopardy!” lastmonth. A

“I saw him play Ken Jennings. My heart
sank a little,” he said. ' *‘

Kester said that the questions in “Jeopar-
dy!” typically aren’t that hard — it’s retrieving
the information quickly that’s the challenge.

He added that the challenge wasn’t about
trivia, it was about buzzing. -

Watson receives the text of the question
the same time it appeared -on screen for par-
ticipants to read. While the humans read the
words and searched for the information, Wat-
son would take the text and run it through a se-

- ries of algorithms to determine the answer.

It will only answer questions it is conﬁ-
dent in: During the game, Watson’s conﬁdence
level was represented by a bar graph on a large
screen behind the players. Typically, Watson

would only answer if it was more than 50 per-
cent sure the answer was correct.

David Ferrucci, IBM principal investigator
and “father” of Watson, explained the process
in a lecture before the game.

Using the question, “In cell division, mito-
sis splits the nucleus and cytokinesis ‘splits this
liquid cushioning the nucleus,” Ferrucci broke
down how Watson tackles the question.

V First, Watson goes through all the text it
has in its memory andcomes up with a list of
possible answers. In this case, Watson came up i
with organelle, vacuele, cytoplasm and plasma.
Using key words in the question, Watson then
scans for phrases or sentences that would 10-
cate the correct answer.

In its search, Watson found, “Cytoplasm is ‘
a ﬂuid surrounding the nucleus.”

department of the United Steel Workers Interna-

sentiments. He said that his union considers

. students to be workers.

Although SGB has not endorsed any political
alternative to the cuts, the unions and members
of otherorganizations advocatedforhighertaxes
on corporations. -

“The steel workers take the position that the
countryain’tbroke, the state ain’tbroke, andthat
we don’t have a budget problem —— we have a

revenue problem,” Perez said.
LaRue agreed.

“Pennsylvania is the only state with any sig— i

‘niﬁcant natural gas drilling that doesn’t tax that
industry substantially,” he said.

An extractiontax on Marcellus Shale natural
gas drilling also came up at several points dur-
ing the rally as a possible source of revenue to
fund education — though Corbetthas said that
his no—new—tax pledge extends to natural gas
companies. Corbett has received hundreds of
thousands, of dollars to form natural gas drilling

companies’ political action committees, accord-
ing to campaign ﬁnance data.

It was that stance that induced community
member and activist Mel Packer to call Corbett,
“Governor Corporate.”

Packer said duringaspeechthathis daughter

Watson didn’t goof

’Watson.< 5

But Watson’s weakness is the ability to com-
pletely understand the nuances of language.
Whereas ahuman would understand that in this
context, a ﬂuid is a liquid, Watson does not.

So, it runs an additional algorithm to see if
a ﬂuid is a liquid.

Although Watson is notorious for defeating
“Jeopardy!” champion Kenjennings, it didn’t
begin as a super—intelligent machine.

In its developmental stages, Watson once
answered, “This Frenchman was the father of
bacteriology” with “How tasty was my little
Frenchman?”

But it didn’t make any goofs-like that in
yesterday’s matchup. In fact, the computer
answered so many questions in the ﬁrst round

 ‘ that moderator Eric Brown, an IBM researcher,

was forced to slow down Watson’s response
time. . ,

He also started reading the questions more
rapidly, giving the humans more time to buzz in
the answer. The humans were only allowed to
buzz after he had read to acertain point.

Even with the help, both Pitt and CMU fell
quickly to Watson. It would frequently answer
entire categories, like Classical Music, Romans
and O Gods, causingthe CMU students to throw
their hands up in frustration.

The last question’s category was Characters
in Classical Literature. The query was, “The ﬁrst
person mentioned by name in ‘The Man in the
Iron Mask’ is this hero of a previous book by
the same author.” ' '

All three got the question right:

D’Artagne.

Even though Watson had a healthy lead
heading into the ﬁnal round, it still wagered
$15,099, launchingitto a grand total of $52,199.
Pitt made the smallest wager of $1,937, bump-
ing it up to $12,937, and CMU still came in last
with $7,463, almost doubling what it had with
a $3,063 wager.

Junior Doug Slocum, who is also a member
of Pitt’s Quiz Bowl, was at the event to cheer on
his school. He said he was proud that Pitt got
second, even though he wasn’t expecting it.

“I expected them to get shlanked by Wat-
son,” he said. I

“The impact has happened because of the

Tim Craft, the Rainbow Alliance business

the importance of having allies. _

Savage said the videos help children who
come out to unresponsive or even hostile
parents.

“Parents need to stop bullying their kids,
and even if they think their child is gay, they
need to let them know that they will love and
accept them for who they are,” Savage said.

He also pointed out the paradox that ex-
ists for queer children. Whereas some have a
loving support system, others are still victims
of bullying and abuse.

Don't let silicon get
under your skin

s the specter of cold, sleet
Aand Poe—esque gloom de-

scends again upon our
humble little city, driving Pitt
students indoors, Mother Nature
almost seems to have granted us a
chance to reflect. And especially
as an IBM computer just obliter-
ated Pittsburgh college students
— our “best and brightest” ——
in a test of wits, “now” some-
how seems not soon enough to
find meaning in this turbulent
world.

Six students, teams of three
from Pitt and three from Carnegie
Mellon, attempted to engage in
a game show with “Watson,” the
IBM computer now famous for
trogncing two of humankind’s
most accomplished “Jeopardy”
champions, Ken Jennings and

' Brad Rutter, at their own game.

Although, the cash was pretend
in the Pittsburgh version, that
doesn’t mean the student con-
tenders symbolically fared any
better — Watson took $52,199,
while leaving only change for
the humans: $12,937 for Pitt and
$7,463 for CMU.

Stuck with a fixed amount of
neural hardware that dates back
to the era of cavemen, facing a
competitor with intelligence of
infinite flexibility and capacity
to grow ;— i.e., AI technology,
Watson’s future descendents,
etc. — can strike as a bit unset-
tling. Certainly, one CMU student
agreed — “Not cool,” said Will

Zhang, 20-year-old leader of the

CMU team, after being asked how '

his team was feeling, according
to the Associated Press.
But while Pitt students watch

p computers not only decimate us

in trivia, but also start taking over
formerly human-held jobs — like
legal analysis and patient diag-
nosis — we must actively work
to boost our collective mood. As
a start, if you ignore our loss to
Watson, we did beat CMU in an
intellectual competition.

And especially now, this is

‘ a crucial, and a more generally

applicable, point to internalize
— not the triumph at defeating
our brainy neighbors, but how
at times that seem primed to de-
press, weneed to pick from our
environment what makes us hap-
py and press on with our lives.

Look at your RSS feed today

dar and realize that whereas sum-
mer has made it onto the horizon,

a few more years on its lease. I

Give Women’s orgasms
their deserved respect

Sexuality—exploring documentary edifies on history of sex toys

Leah Trimble
Columnist

As Women’s History Month comes
to a close, I think it’s extremely im-
portant to celebrate . .. well, women.
Sorry guys,‘we’re inpthe limelight
this time.

In honor of this month—long hur-
rah, I was kindly invited to Pitts-
burgh Filmmakers for a screening
of “Passion and Power: The Technol-
ogy of Orgasm,” a hilarious docu-
mentary based on an academic book
by Rachel Maines, a feminist histo-
rian and visiting scientist at Cornell
University. .

- The documentary explores the
history of vibrators and the issues
surrounding the outward sexuality
of women in this country. For the few
hours that remain in Women’s His-
tory Month, I think that it’s my duty
to inform everyone, boys included,

of some very interesting details I
learned from this experience. _
The well-researched production
alerted me of the anti-vibrator laws
have actually existed in this country
— the strongest of them continues
to offend in Alabama. According to
Maines’ research, in medieval times,

b the uterus was put on a pedestal. And

it was thought that women needed
to achieve orgasm to conceive. Now
that’s the right idea! _

This was all ﬁne and dandy until
16th century-astronomer Nicolaus
Copernicus promoted a social revo-
lution with his scientiﬁc discoveries,
which created a social movement
that gave men the ideal body and
women, well, the opposite. This
continued into the Victorian era,
and ﬁnally women started to get irri-
tated, leading to the popularization
of the fanciful condition of female
“hysteria.” Some of the symptoms
included, for example, “reading

French novels while wearing tight
corsets, disagreeing with husbands,
sexual fantasy and vaginal lubrica-
tion.”»
' This is serious, believe it or not.
According to the documentary, in
order to reverse the symptoms, one
must give the applicable area some
much—needed attention. V

Fast forward to the 17th century,
when_Lazare Riviere, a French doc-
tor, described hysteria as a condi-
tion that “mainly affects virgins
and young widows. It may also af-
fect married women that have im-
potent husbands. If marriage fails
as a remedy, some advise that the
genital parts should be, by a cunning
midwife, so handled and rubbed,
so as to cause an evacuation of the
over—abounding ﬂuids.”

Can you believe this? In the
1600s, doctors were prescribing
ﬁngering sessionsto women who
were basically ﬁending for sex.

Regarding vibrator types, obvi-

However, even though we’ve pro-

MOVIE COLUMN

Some ﬁlms impossible to Watch -i

Andy Tybout
. Assistant A&E Editor

 

The interminable newﬁlm “Modern
Times Forever” isn’t likely to win
any Oscars — or even attract many
viewers. It is, however, a worthy
contender for the title of ultimate
cinematic paradox: a movie that’s
not meant to be seen.

Clocking in at 240 hours, “For-.

ever” bills itselfas the longest ﬁlm of
all time —— surpassing the 150-hour
“Cinematon,” a seemingly endless
collection of vignettes. According to
BBC News, “Forever” is being shown
“only once” at Helsinki’s IHME Con-
temporary Art Festival, on an ‘out-
door screen behind the Stora Enso
building.

Despite its Olympian length,
the ﬁlm can be summarized in two

simple sentences: “Forever” depicts
the imagined decay of the aforemen-
tioned Enso building, accelerated
to the degree that each real—time
day equals roughly 700 years. The
movie, according to its ofﬁcial syn-
opsis, intends to portray whatwould
happen “if the days of humankind
come to an end, and only time and
the weather affect the building.”

This is, of course, an absurd
abuse of cinema —— not so much
a ﬁlm as an endurance test. It’s
comforting, then, to hear that the
“masterminds” of this project —- the
Danish art group Superﬂex — are
hardly a bunch of self-serious au-
teurs. In fact, Superﬂex is renowned
for its elaborate pranks, including a
campaign to blanket Copenhagen in
red posters that read, “Foreigners
please don’t leave us alone with the
Danes.”

Of course, impossibly long, self-
aware ﬁlms are hardly novel phe-
nomena: “The Cure for Insomnia”
—— a movie in which poet Lee Groban
reads his 4,080-page piece of the
same name, interrupted occasion-
ally by pornographicfootage and
rock music videos — beat the Dan-
ish group to the punch by 24 years.
“The Longest Most Meaningless
Movie-in the World” (1978), a 48-
hour montage of advertisements,
outtakes and other scraps of found
footage, is similarly self-conscious.

Other interminable productions

are signiﬁcantly less tongue-in- ‘

cheek. “Cinematon,” for instance,
is by no means a joke — or if it is,
it’s one director Gerard Courant
pursued with remarkable serious-
ness. A movie at least 31 years in the

-making, “Cinematon” is a compi-

lation of three-minute, 25-second

scenes featuring various subjects
doing whatever they want in the
allotted «time period. Highlights in-

clude directors Terry Gilliam eating »

a 100-Franc note and Samuel Fuller
smoking a cigar.

“Matrjoschka,” a German ﬁlm
depicting the glacially slow trans-
formation of a picture, is also quite
straight-faced, as is “A Journey of
Crude Oil” (2008), a14-hour Chinese
documentary about oil workers in
the Gobi Desert. _

Whether or not these movies
were intended as pranks‘, they’re
all the product of an intriguing cin-
ematic perspective — one in which
a ﬁlm’s value isn’t derived from the
experience of viewing it, but from
its very existence. Indeed, actually
watching these movies would be
excruciating and foolhardy. I sus-
pect the directors, although looney

n one sitting

in other respects, realize as much.

. Actual audiences, it’s clear, are an af-

terthought when pursuinga suppos-
edly unattainable cinematic goal.
That’s not to say it’s impossible
to engage these ﬁlms —— merely that
movie fans must do so on a purely
second-hand basis. Consideraquote
from Argentine author Jorge Luis
Borges: “The composition of vast
books is a laborious and impoverish-
ing extravagance  More reason-
able, more inept, more indolent,I
have preferred to write notes upon
imaginary books.” Like the sprawl-
ing, esoteric novels Borges invented
and critiqued in his brief short sto-
ries, these ﬁlms can be encapsulated,
and admired, in a scant few sentenc-
es. It’s best to read about them in
newspapers, magazines, blogs — to

appreciate their scale without actu- _

ally having to endure it. __

ALBUM REVIEW

Wiz Khalifa falls prey to
pop-star convenions

Chris Neverman
Contributing Editor

Rolling Papers

Wiz Khalifa

Atlantic Records

Rocks like: the newest soundtrack at
theunder-18 club
D+/C-

Long—time fans’ ﬁrst mistake was allowing
their expectations for Rolling Papers to
increase by the greatness of Wiz Khalifa’s
latest mixtape, Cabin Fever, which was
released in mid—February. V
Their second mistake was assuming
that the album would be at least as good
as Wiz Khalifa’s ﬁrst album, Show and
Prove. This was understandable, all things
considered, but a mistake nonetheless.
Wiz Khalifa opens the album with a
nod to his detractors, who note that all
he raps about is money, women and weed.
He then proceeds to rap about money,
women and weed. This formula is almost
foolproof, as the rapper has proven over
the years — provided it’s done in a cohe-

sive, engrossing manner.

One of Wiz Khalifa’s calling cards has
been his impeccable beat selection. From
2006’s Prince of the City: Welcome to Pis-
tolvania all the way to last summer’s Kush

’ and Orange juice, each album featured

dope beats from producers like Sledgren
and Pittsburgh’s own Bigjerm.
Originally a rapper who picked his
“own lane,” Wiz Khalifa has, overthe last
two years, gradually drifted toward the
abyss of rappers-turned—pop stars that has
ruined many a career. On Rolling Papers,
he again turns to shallow, poppy beats
from the likes of Benny Blanco to drive his

- tracks. In the end, the production is simply

lacking, as is the lyrical content.
Although Wiz Khalifa has never been
a wordsmith — nor has he ever strived
to be one — his formula of sticking to
basic metaphors and relying on incredible
hooks to carry his tracks has worked for
more than five years. Why he decided to
continue his journey toward Bieber—town
on his first major release is a mystery.
Given an opportunity to do anything he
wanted, to change the game in any number

of ways, Wiz Khalifa unfortunately caved

Along with the theme that Shearer describes
as “kicking it old school,” he also limited himself
to drawingPirates who playedfortheteamduring
awinning season.

“So, unfort1Inately,youwill notsee any Pirates
from the last 18 years,” he said.

Some ofthe players thatviewers can expectto

seearefanlavorites, suchas Roberto Clemente and I

Bill Mazeroski. Shearer also included his personal
favor:ites:J_im Morrison, John Candelaria and, of
course, Tekulve. A

Accordingly, below each piece of artwork in
Shearefs exhibitwillbeanexplanation ofwhythat
player was signiﬁcant to his childhood. Though

those players are no longer active members of .

the team, the Pirates organization has yet to lose
a place in Shearer’s heart.

“Ithinkfans growup rootingforateam, and
they stick with them through the rough times,”
Robinson said. She drewaparallelto the Chicago
Cubs, who have_n’twon aworld Series inmorethan
100 years, but have never lost their supportive
and hopeﬁil fans.’

“Ialsothinkalotofpeople reallywantto seethe
team turn things aroun ” Robinson said.

For Shearer, making peace with the Pirates
with “Opening Day: Yinz Luv ’Da Buccos” was a
good place to start in the 180-degree process.

Rebecca Morris, Wildcard proprietor and a
friend of Shearer’s, knew the importance of the

p

Pirates to Shearer and encouraged him to serge
as guest artistfor the month of April.

“With the opening day of the Pirates season I

being April 1, I thought [the exhibit] was timely,”
she said. f‘We sellalotofPittsburgh—li1emed items
[at Wildcard], so I thought his artwork would be
a good ﬁt.” **
' The Pirates will take on the Chicago Cub

at Wrigley Field that day, but Shearer thinks it
would be worthwhile for them to stop by Wild-
card sometime during the month and check out
the exhibit.

In the meantime, a former Pirate will-serve
as a surprise guest for tomorrow’s event to sign

I autographs for attendees.

Both Shearerand Morris thoughtthis personal
addition to the eventwas the perfect way to kick
off the season.

“We give a lot of love to the Steelers and Pen—
guins here in Pittsburgh,” Morris'said, so she anti
Shearer are only expanding that devotion to an-

’ other Pittsburgh team.

To the fans in Pittsburgh, she olfered this

David Chester, who has played more than 72 games in his Pitt career, boasts a ﬁelding percentage of .995

with just three errors.

Roger Sepich
Staff Writer

It took David Chester some extra
time to ﬁnd his way to Pitt.

He started near Collinsville,
Okla., spending four years playing
baseball, basketball and football
in high school. After graduation,
he attended an Oklahoma com-
munity college for two years so
that he could continue with base-

. ball, his sport of choice.

Chester thrived at the junior
college. As a freshman, he ﬁn-
ished with a .349 batting average,

1 18 home runs and 52 RBIs. As a

preseason A1l—America selection
his sophomore year, he hit .370,
drove in 72 runs and hit 18 home
runs.

After two seasons of putting
up those numbers, a Division I
baseball-team came calling.

“Pitt came after me pretty
hard, and I came on a visit,” Ches-
ter said. “I went to a basketball

Ehester leads Panthers at the plate

game, and I really liked it. 391
decided to come here and signed
early. I’ve loved it ever since.”

Pitt loves having him around,
too. Since the transfer at the be-
ginning of his junior year, Chester
has started all but three games at
ﬁrst base for the Panthers.

Now a redshirt senior, Chester
provides much of the power at the
plate for head'coachJoeJordano’s
Panthers. '

“David can change a game in a
big way — fast. In any park untier
any conditions David’s bat is ‘a
threat,”]ordano said in an e—mail.
“It’s exciting to watch.”

Coming off a season where
Chester hit a team—high 15 home
runs, drove in 63 runs and was
named a third—team All-Big East
player, the 6-foot—5, 270-pound
slugger faced high expectations
heading into the 2011 cam-
paign.

Now, more than 20 games into
the season, Chester hasn’t faﬂéd
to deliver.

THROWING  KIRSCHBALL

Baseball seasonbrings relaxation for Pittsburgh fans

Lauren Kirschman

 

My first column this school
year was about the Pittsburgh
Pirates. They were entering the
last month of yet another los-
ing season and finished with a
miserable 57-105 record. As the
year came to a close, the only title
the Bucs held was the worst team
in baseball. '

Again. ‘

But instead of writing about
that, I wrote about the reasons

That’s a phrase fans in Pitts-

burgh have been uttering a lot.

recently. But for the Pirates, next
year has arrived. Happy Opening
Day, everyone.

At least take comfort in this
as we begin the 2011 campaign
— when there are no expecta-
tions, it’s hard to have your heart
broken. If the Pirates take an-
other plunge into more than 100
losses, well, it’s kind of hard to
say you couldn’t have imagined

 that happening.

Then again, if the Bucs man-
age to ﬁnish over .500, it’ll feel
like they won the World Series.
What other sports team in Pitts-
burgh can satisfy fans that easily?
It’s a depressing fact, but at least

the season will be relaxing.

Pitt sports are too stressful.
The collective blood pressure of
Pittsburgh needs a chance to drop
to a normal level again. So get

mightily last season with oné'ﬁf
the league’s worst ﬁelding per-

Although not known for their
offensive productivity, Overbay
and Snyder should be able to help
the Pirates defensively. 

As far as the offense, that
should be the Pirates’ strength
this season. Keyword: should.

There doesn’t seem to be any

Chester solid defensively at firs

Chester 4 17

Chester has become a staple in Pitt’s
lineup as the notorious cleanup batter,
consistently hitting fourth in the batting
order. And despite the new, deeper Pe-

tersen Sports Complex — a harder place to .

hit home runs than Pitt’s previous home at
Trees Field — Chester currently leads the
Panthers (13-9, 1-2 Big East) with 25 runs
batted in and ﬁve home runs.

“It’s awesome and deﬁnitely a major
improvement,” Chester said of the new
stadium. “It’s a little bigger than last year,
which is the onlything that stinks, but the
ball can still ﬂy out of there.”,

A recent six—game hitting streak earned »

Chester recognition as the Big East Player
of the Week for the week ending on March
20. In that week alone, he tallied-four home
runs, 10 hits and 11 RBIs. Fellow senior
Travis Whitmore said Chester’s offensive
abilities help make him a team leader.

“We look to him for big hits, and when
he does well, we do well,” he said.

Chester also helps guide the team with
his attitude, Whitmore added.

“He plays the game hard and respects
it,” Whitmore said. “No matter what the
score is, he’s playing hard, and it helps the
other guys, too.” ,
Beyond his ability to hit the long ball,

Chester’s ﬁelding talents ensure that he
is an everyday player for Pitt. Over the 72
games that the ﬁrst baseman has played
in his Pitt career, Chester has amassed a
.995 ﬁelding percentage by committing
just-three errors.

“He’s an anchor at ﬁrst base,” Jordano
said. . ’

Chester said that he takes pride in his
defense, adding that it’s a focus of the
coaches.

“We’ve got some good coaches that help
out and teach us well [on defense],” he
said. .

With his combined abilities to put runs

on the board and keep opponents from do-r _

ing the same, it’s no surprise that Chester
hascaught the eye of Major League Baseball
scouting websites focusing on the upcom-
ing draft injune.

But for now, Chester is just concentrat-
ing. on enjoying his senior season at Pitt
and helping the team win.

“You can’t think about [the prospect of
being drafted] too much,” Chester said.
“The thought has crossed my mind, but I
feel like the better I play now, the more wins
we’ll get, and the more chance I’ll have of
playing in the pros. We’d like to make a run
at the Big East tournament this year.” I

want or expect right now,” Brode said. “But
we’re working hard on getting where we
need to be.”

In the '2010 season, Pitt went 6-9-2.
Many of the matches were close contests,
as evidenced by a goal margin of minus-

_ four. ‘

Pitt played Very well at home, posting
a 6-2-1 record in Pittsburgh. However, the
Panthers ran into a great deal of trouble
away from their home ﬁeld. Including two
neutral site games, the Panthers never won

. a game away from Pittsburgh, ﬁnishing

0-7-1 on the road. '
Currently, one of Pitt’s most -valuable
players from last season is ruled ineligible
because of academics. Hami Kara, a junior
goalie, was in the net for every game Pitt

in each one of those six victories.

If Kara cannot improve his grades to
be reinstated to the team, thelikely pros-
pect to step up is freshman Matt Aberegg.
Aberegg started two games last year and
played in a third. However, Aberegg allowed
ﬁve goals in those three games and posted
a record of 0-2.

“Hami is a great guy and mentor. He .

helped me a lot through the fall,” Aberegg
said. “I ‘started a couple games,‘and he was
really supportive. But I’m glad that I get to

capitalizepthis spring on making myself bet-
ter. I have a great group of guys around me,

and I’m excited to ﬁnish up this spring.”
Spring practice is important for de-

veloping a sense of team unity as well as

preparing the team to be in the best condi-

tion possible for the fall slate of matches. 1

Freshman midﬁelder Daniel Mark said. the
Panthers have come together as a team
during spring practice. 0

“This spring, our focus to get better ev-
ery day and we have really improved, we are

ready to prove ourselves,” Mark_said. “We '

' and preparing ourselves in every aspect for

the fall season.” I

The Panthers return their top goal-
scorer, defenseman and mid-ﬁelder Sam
Luffy. Luffy, a redshirtjunior, scored nine
goals last year. ‘ -

The second leading scorer, mid-ﬁelder
Alex Betancourt, graduates in May,’ and Alex
Grayson, the»team’s third-leading scorer,
is the player most likely to takeover. The
striker scored six goals in the fall, but his
return to the pitch for the Panthers is now
in jeopardy. Grayson came to Pitt from
Cheshire, England, but encountered pass-
port issues in the winter. He’s.been unable
to return to Pittsburgh since. _ .

Fortunately for Pitt, the fourth and ﬁfth
leading scorers, Brode and Terry Akpua,

both return. With Luffy, Brode, Akpua, and '

possibly Grayson in place, the Panthers

_ boast a core of players capableof scoring.

The Panthers continue to. practice and
will ﬁnish up their spring schedule of games
