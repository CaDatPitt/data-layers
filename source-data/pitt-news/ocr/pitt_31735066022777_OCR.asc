Freshmen will have adjustments to make as they settle into life at Pitt,
but returning students will share in these adjustments as several major _
changes have occurredat the university since the start of summer vacation. . 1 , I

A revised residence hall policy and a new food service contract ‘
highlighted the culmination of a busy 1979-80 school year.

The new visitation policy, which wentinto effect arthe beginning of .
spring term, no longer permits 24-hour visitation. From 2-8 a.m. Monday p‘
through Friday, a resident may not host a visitor of the opposite sex unless f,
the visitor is member of the resident’s immediate family. ‘ * '1

A visitor who is a member of the same sex as his resident-host and visits
from 2-8 a.m. is considered an overnight guest and must deposit identifica-'
tion at the security desk, according to the new policy. A resident may have
overnight guests for a maximum of 30 days per term. , -

When Vice Chancellorfor Student Affairs Conney Kimbo outlined the
policy to an overflow crowd of resident students at David Lawrence Hall in .
February, he said the revisions were made to maintain privacy-and security
in the residence halls. However, members of the Resident StudenkAssocia-
tion’s‘Inter-Residence Board (IRB) said the policy violated student rights._

IRB’s efforts to halt enactment of the policy, which included hiring an
attorney and staging a “study-in”_ outside a board of trustees meeting,.
gained local and national media coverage.‘ -The organization’s inﬂuence
played a part in the administration's decision to allow 24-hour visitation on
weekends. In addition, the new policy should be reviewed at the endof the
summer. A ' ’ W »

Many students contended that the_new visitation policy was the universi-
ty’s direct reaction to the murder of Monica Renee Jones in the Towers in
January, 1979. Students who had resided on Jones’s floor in TowerB told '
The Pitt News in September that Sidney Brinkley, accused in the murder of
J ones, lived on -the floor "with a girlfriend for nearly two months and har-.\ .
rassed other female residents. ,Brinkley’s stay in the Towers"violated‘the if
visitation policy then in effect, which said that a resident could not host a T

guest for more than five days at a time. V 2

The «.1979 season, which started out to be a building year for the Pa-nther \_
football team to help a relatively young squad gain experience, turned into - \
much more than that. Pitt not only went.l1-1, including a 16-10 victory
over. Arizona in the Fiesta Bowl, but ended up ranked sixth in one major
national poll. . R» j V

After the Panthers finished 8-4 in 197-8, the spoiled Pitt fan wanted more
and got it in 1979 and, by the end of _the season visions of a national cham-

  

thusiasts. . ’ _- _
-The.Panthers opened the season with-a thorough 24-0 thrashing of a

opening of another class act for Pitt—the Big. Mac Attack of Randy .,
McMillan. The fullback gained 141 yards on 21 carries in his first start as a ;
Panther. The Pitt offense gained 356 total yards, while the defense stifled '
the Jayhawks, allowing only 281ya_rds rushing. - - p 3 _
The following week, Pitt suffered its only loss of the season at the hands 3 ;

seemed to lack the poise and consistency it had against Kansas. Pitt turned ‘ _
the ball over seven times and McMillan‘ was held to just 34-yards on 11 car- .

ries. The Panthers were pinned deep in their own territory for most of the _:
game and UNC’coach Dick Crum attributed the win to the kicking game.
Pitt’s lone score was a 13-yard pass from quarterback Rick’Trocano .to
flanker Kenny Bowles.

(Excerpted from Article
III of the Bylaws of the
University of Pittsburgh)

At 9:00 on the morning of July
15, Wesley Wentz Posvar, Pitt’s
15th chancellor, was in a very un-

- natural position.

He was on his back in a dentist’s
chair in Pitt’s School of Dental
Medicine, elevated four feet from
the floor, and helpless. A plastic
suction tube, two gleaming dental
instruments, and a hygienist’s
hands occupied his mouth while the
sterile operating room ceiling
blanketed his eyesight. He squirm-
ed..often, tried not to clear ‘his
throat and choke on his saliva, and
glanced at his watch repeatedly.
Soft Muzak and the whining sounds
of dental students drilling their pa-
tients to new heights of pain filled
the background. Here was the man
whohas shaken hands with ,U.S.

mouth, and like’ a rabbit suddenly
let loose, he jumped out of the
chair, slipped on his jacket and
breezed through the waiting room
and out thefront doors.

Outside in the “no parking” area
waited ‘Leonard, Posvar’s chauf-
feur in a red station wagon. Posvar
climbed‘ in the front seat and
Leonard pulled out, building up a
brisk speed down “Cardiac Hill” in
the direction of Posvar’s first floor
Cathedral of Learning office. ..

At the intersectionof Forbes and
Bigelow, Posvar spotted an old
friend in an adjacent car.

“What are you doing goofin’
off?!-” the normally complacent
Posvar shouted out the window,
revealing a side of Wesley Posvar’s
personality reserved for the most in-
timate of associates. But conversa-
tion ended as soon as the light
changed, and Pitt’s chancellor went

‘on with his schedule.

For a man whose concept of time
consists of the finely chiseled
minutes in a daily schedule, such
frivolous expenditures must cease
and the business of running a
university takes priority. Leonard
skillfully maneuvered through traf-
fic and arrived at the Forbes en-
trance to the Cathedral. Posvar
shouldered a blue and gold Pitt
bookbag and climbed but into a
light rain, then hesitated for a mo-

mentand wondered if an umbrella ‘

wouldbe necessary. No, he decid-
ed, his schedule indicated he would

not be leaving the building that day, ,

and he turned and broke into a
stride towards the building. a

Arrival and Early Accomplishments

“I found the pressures here to be

tremendous,” Posvar recalled in a a

recent interview, referri-nggto his ar-
rival at Pitt in 1967, “butl enjoyed
it and did enjoy itso much that I
tended to thrive under pressure.
And whenever I can’t do that then I
shouldn’t. continue.’ ’_

Well, if he is true to his word,.

then Posvar must have “thrived”

every waking _-minute on the

pressures waiting for him when he
took over the chancellor’s position.
The previous decade of extensive
and far-reaching expansion steered
by Posva_r’s “Olympian”
predecessor, the late Edward H.
Litchfield, had amassed more than
$20 'million in accumulated debts
and alienated much of the affluent
business community ‘in Pittsburgh,

a major source of funds for Pitt.
Posvar had been given an ailing
giant, irate businessmen, new
responsibilities .to the com-
monwealth because of Pitt’s new
stature as a state-related university,
and a lot of headaches.

Pitt’s financial. trauma of the
mid-sixties has often been cited as
an example of growing too big too
soon. Chancellor Litchfield, called
a “coldly brilliant administrator
who runs Pitt as majestically as An-
drew Carnegie once poured steel,”
by TIME magazine in 1962, was
hired in 1955 at the beginning of
what the late Alan M. Scaife,
former chairman of Pitt’s board of
trustees, said were “new goals,
which, when reached, will place the

University of Pittsburgh among the,

leaders of the world’s great univer-
sities.” This might have passed for

mere trusteerhetoric except for‘the—

fact that Scaife was the brother-in-
law of Richard K. Mellon, the
banking millionaire and Pitt
trustee, and, incidentally, Pitts-
b‘urgh’s most influential
businessman since the late Andrew
Carnegie. Scaife knew what he was
talking about, how to get the
resources for it, and he expected

, Litchfield to fulﬁll . his plans of

greatness for Pitt.

And Litchfield did accomplish
During his ten year
term from 1955 to 1965, the number
of full-time faculty members at Pitt
doubled and nearly 90 percent of

a

‘Posvar and Edward Bozik,

them had doctoral degrees, com-
pared with 5_6 percent previously.
The number of students from other
states ‘and nations‘ rose from four
percent to 34 percent, dormitories
were expanded from accom-
modating 100 students in 1954 to
housing 3,400 -in 1965,
value of the physical plant increased
from $32 million to $120 million.

In addition, three schools, three’

departments, 10 centers and 17 pro-
grams were added, and the faculty-
student ratio dropped from 12-1 to
8-1.

Although Litchfield is credited

for bringing Pitt into the ranks of |

nationally recognized universities in

his attempt to make Pitt “second to '

none,” he-is also criticized for his
overly ambitious expenditures of
university funds’. When Litchfield
wanted to add a program or expand
a department, his last concern was
where the money would come from.
Others have criticized his arrogant
attitude in dealing with the trustees.
Faculty members often felt
neglected in his plans, and the Pitts-
burgh business community began to
lose confidence in the large debts
-being incurred by the university.
The end result of all this was Pitt
‘going state-related in 1966 under a
similaragreenient made earlier bet-
ween Temple University in
Philadelphia and the state. And the
trustees took an attitude toward
the attainment of less exorbitant
goals, with the hopethat Pitt would
level off on some of the massive ex-
pansion pioneered by Litchfield
while maintaining the current levels

.-of quality.

Litchfield suffered a heart attack
in May of 1965 and {resigned from
his post in July of that year. He
died March 8, l968,in a plane crash
over Lake Michigan. ‘ After Lit-
chfield and the controversies sur-
rounding him were gone, there was
a 11/2-year search to fill the position
with the emphasis on finding a
chancellor possessing goals propor-
tional to the resources available.

Trustees Find Replacement .

The trustees found their replace-
ment in a rather unexpected place
for the time—the Air Force
Academ_\,where he was chairman of
the Social Sciences Division and the
Political Science Department, hav-
ing achieved tenure in 1957 as the
youngest department chairman at
any service academy. However,
“Colonel” Posvar had distinguish-
ed himself from most military of-
ficers as the recipient of an im-

pressive fiveacademic degrees: two ~
at Oxford, in philosophy, politics,
and economics, two at Harvard ‘for’
-his masters in: Public Administra-

,tion ‘and a, 'Ph.D.' in political

science, -and one at West’ Point in
engineering. When he graduated in

1946 from from West Point, he was '

the first in the largest class in the
history of the«Academy—875 men.'

Posvar had a rather unusual
military career, maintaining his in-
terests along an academic line

rather than pursuing the usual field ’

or combat ambitions of most career
military men. Hisgspecialties lie in
international -politics, decision-
making methodology, systems
analysis, arms control and disarma-
ment, urban planning, and ad-
ministration and management of
resources for higher education.‘

’Posvar said the training he receiv-
ed at West Point has not necessarily
been applied to his civilian leader-
ship positions’.

“Part of the key in West Point
‘training is to learn more about how I

not to manage people than how to
manage them,” he said, adding,
“You have to lead by example, not
just by command.

‘ “I learned
leadership at West Point ‘and I also
learned somethingabout wh'af’s re-
quired besides the military, what
qualities are required. But I don’t
think it’s fair to say~that ‘people
become- better leaders because they
go to West Point—-because the peo-
ple who go there inthe first place
are people who want to be leaders
and who have an interest in it.
Whether the training ‘itself has any
material effect is hard to say.” 1

But academic credentials and
leadership qualities aside, Posvar
had one quality that many trustees
were elated over: moderation. As
soon as he was selected for the top
job, Posvar made assurances that
he would level off, at least for the
time being, sometof the-costly ex-
pansion brought on by his
predecessor, and yet maintain
academic quality. ’

“My general philosophy, as far
as the administration is concerned,
is that a new broom ought not to
sweep clean. \_ I would propose to
change nothing until I know what
I’m doing,” Posvar said at his first
press conference at Pitt in January,
1967._ ’ -  . ‘

But now, 13 years later with the
financial quagmire weathered,
Posvar feels _ confident to make

substantial expansion to the Univer-

sity—at a calculated rate.
“I meant that the changes should
be evolutionary but that they

' should still be substantial,”-Posvar

said, reflecting on the statement he
made at the I967 press conference.
“And I made a lotof ‘changes. I.

years I was here. But I didn’t do it
hastily. I_ didn't come in and say
'‘I’m going to make everything dif-
ferent.’ ”

s And he did make‘ some changes.
In the 10 years it took to put Pitt on
stable financial grounds, Posvar has
made a number of improvements in
the credibility and outside image of
Pitt. Besides making amends to the
local business community, the
University was elected to the
American Association~of Univer-
sities, a select 50 member group re-
quiring high academic standards,
centered on research and graduate
study. .
students on‘ the ﬁve campuses has
doubled, the budget is now $254.6
million, and there have been more
than 21 new buildings constructed
or added onto.

“We’ve irnproved-,” Posvar once
commented in an interview, “I
know we need some fine tuning, but
things have been accomplished.”

An “Arduous” Experience

An elevator ride to the twelfth
floor of the Cathedral of Learning

' begins what will be a long and

tedious day for __ Pitt’s chancellor.
Before him awaits a series of
meetings with his top administrative
officers to discuss next year's
budget; Conney Kimbo, student af-
fairs; Edison Montgomery, the
health services; Joseph 'Dutton,
business and finance; Bernard
Kobosky, public affairs; Jack
Freeman, administration; Rhoten
Smith, Provost and academics; and
Edward Bozik, the assistant
chancellor. _

_“A- very arduous experience,”
Posvar confides, reﬂecting on_ the
budget «process.

Inside the conference room, a

‘handsomely decorated section of

the Cathedral, the student affairs
budget meeting_ is already in pro-
> gress. At one side of a long
mahogany table sits Conney Kim-
bo, vice chancellor for student af-
fairs, and his executive assistant,’
Directly across
from them is Jack Freeman, a
Jl‘ikeable‘,"cJo;g1UpAromising man with a
light southern accent, and three of
his staff. Posvar removes his jacket

‘and sits at the head of_ the table,

positioning himself between
Freeman and Kimbo.

Posvar is not an impressive man
physically, standing less than six
feet tall and slightly squat in
but he is an easily
distinguished figure on -Pitt’s carn-
pus. If there is one recognizable
feature of Wesley Posvar, the one
outstanding item that sets him apart
from the crowd, it’s the eyebrows.
Always the eyebrows. His bushy

» eyebrows, as red in color as any
Iris-hman’s V head, are almost an
inch long, and just ‘barely touch the
first few worry-lines
forehead.’ Some students have been
heard to joke that if eyebrows
meant physical stength, then Posvar
would win Mr. America every time.
But the length of his eyebrows are
the last thing on Posvar’s mind
right now. .

While Freeman rummages
through Kimbo’s budget proposal,
questioning the validity or expense
of certain proposals, Posvar re-
mains quiet, tappinghis fingers, on
the table and keeping slightly dis-
tant from the discussion. Occa-
sionally Posvar asks a question cone

of his ’

hundredsaof thousands of university
dollars, although an observer might

t assume Posvar has a million other

things he’d rather be doing. He
maintains a slight air of detachment
about him, * communicated by his
restlessness, an impression that he
would much prefer to get on with
some more. pressing concern, like
meeting with the heads of the other
state:related universities to discuss

o appropriations, or making a faculty

tenure" decision. But as removed as
he may appear to be, Wesley Posvar
is fiercely attentive to the scene
before him.‘ Like a hawk, hehovers

...like a hawk, he hovers, above the
participants, sighting and carefully

all angles of the discussion, then he
swoops down aggressively and asks
a precise question deserving a

speciﬁc answer. . .

cerning the long-term effects of a
certain proposal or a question
Freeman has neglected.

“It’s an exciting, innovative
idea,” Posvar comments on a stu-
dent affairs proposal, but then he
cites the budget constraints the
University is currently experiencing.

“Maybe we should walk before we 7

run on this,” he adds, ending fur-

‘ ther discussion on the matter with a

note of finality.

As he is wont to do at lengthy
meetings, Posvar has laid out
before him a series of color-coded
index cards and a blue pocket
datebook. The ' index
cards--prepared by his.
secretary'—are his schedule for the
day down to each quarter hour, and
the datebook is ‘.‘booked six mon-
ths in advance.”

Since he must balance his time
between academia,
countless trusteeships and director-
ships, and thousands of other
detailed obligations, Posvar is ex-
tremely conscious of his time4how
it is used, how it is-managed, and
how productive it is. Unlike people
who take “each day as it comes,”
Posvar thinks in terms of how most -
effectively to use the minutes of his
upcoming days and months. He
often gets up in the middle of a
meeting to make a call to his
secretary to confirm an appoint-
ment, change a date, or make final
plans on an upcoming business trip.

Discussion at the student affairs
meeting concerns the expenditure of

business, »

sion, then he swoops ‘down ag-
gressively andasks a precise ques-
tion deserving a specific answer. He
is annoyed with facetiousness and
impatient with indecisiveness,
qualities Posvar has always re-
jected. ‘

Soon after. Kimbo and Houston
leave, a newsituation develops. Ed-
ward Bozik, the _assistant
chancellor,‘ arrives and sits next to
Posvar. A busload of parents-and
children are outside of the Arsenal
Family and'.Children’s Center Bozik

/

announces, and they are picketing
the recent announcement by Senior
Vice Chancellor for the Health Pro-
fessions Edison Montgomery that
the Pitt sponsored research day-
care center would close due to high
operating costs. The parents are
concerned over the fate of their
childrens’ care, Bozik explains.
Posvar is not alarmed, if anything
he is slightly humored, having‘ had

his share of sit-ins and protests in

the. late sixties and early seventies
during the height of the Vietnam
war. ‘
But the normal schedule of
business has been disrupted by the
news, and an emergency budget
meeting is suddenly initiated. At
first thereis an atmosphere of con-
fusion as numbers are shouted and
sources of funding are tossed
around. Freeman has stood up and
is in the front of the room drawing
a hypothetical problem on the
blackboard. Thomas Lamb, Pitt's
lobbyist and a , former state

' legislator himself, is giving an up-

date on the appropriations pro-
ceedings in Harrisburg—and there,
at the head of the table and in the
middle of all the chaos, sits’Posvar.
Somehow, he must sift through the
assortment of suggestions being
thrown at him and cometo an ap-
propriate decision on the matter. As
is his responsibility, Posvar must
make the ultimate decision, and in
this case, a tentative decision is
reached to give the center $100,000
to keep it open until the winter.

It is with confidence that Posvar
makes his decision,» assured that he
hastaken the proper action in the
situation. And it iswith faith and
trust that the people surrounding

that Pitt’s chancellor has done the

LitchfieId’s Replacements

When Posvar came to Pitt in
June of 1967, he was like Edward
Litchfield, 41 years old, younger.
than many of, the faculty members
and administratorsswho would be
serving under him.
chancellor before’ Posvar was David
Kurtzman, an energetic 61-year-old
who, if he were any younger, would
have taken over the position. But

the trustees were looking for»,
longevity in their chancellor, having , *

had a bad experience with Lit-
chfield’s replacement, Stanton
Crawford, who died of a heart at-

tack only one year into the job. So ‘

the decision was made primarily-
along the lines of injecting some
form of consistency into the ad-
ministration of the university.
“Yes, they (the trustees)‘did want

someone younger,” Posvar reca1l- ~

ed. “Dr. Kurtzman wasnot intend-
ed, he was in his early sixties when
he came here. They never expected
to have him for a long time.”

But besides the age factor, the

trustees were anxious t0 appoint a. ‘

new chancellor so they could pro-
ceed with development plans and,
within two weeks of ever having
heard of him, the trustees elected
Posvar to the chancellor’s position.

Posvar discusses - his views on
leadership and academic freedom.

New Student Leader Program

I   Targeted forFr eshman Class

By MARY KANE
» Pitt News sun Writer
A leadership development pro-
gram designed specifically for in-
coming freshmen will face a trial

A _ run this fall,according to Jack

Brown, assistant director of student

‘ activities.

Brown said the leadership pro-
titled‘ “The Emerging
Leader,” was initiated because “It
was our feeling and our belief that
freshmen, as they start their career
and academic pursuits, are going to
be involved in everything on cam-
pus from governance groups (like
the Nursing Student Organization,
the Engineering Student Cabinet,

' arid the Black Action Society) to ski
c I u b s . ’ ’

“We knew that we needed to
begin to do something on our cam-

V pus a little more in depth, rather

than just letting freshmen learn
from past experience or their own
peers. Governance groups control
large amounts of money and -con-

trol lots of people in a sense,
through that Inoney, and it would
be good to have the methodology
and understanding of the dynamics
of groups and how people are led,”
he added. _

Iowa State University, the
University of Michigan, and Rhode
Island University. are utilizing
similar programs. '

“It’s been working very well,”
said Iowa State Vice President of
Student Affairs Tom Theilen. “One
of the stipulations we have had is
that the student had to be shown to
be a non-leader, and wasn’t involv-
ed in any tangible leadership exper-
ience on campus.”

This fall, the non-credit free pro-
gram will be available to 100
freshmen, according to Brown. He

' added that at this point the program

is a pilot project.

“We don’t have the resources to-

do this for say; 1,000 students,”
Brown said. “We need to find out

where the problems are with the
100, where its difficulties are,
before we move into a larger scale,
and we will probably be doing
that.” ‘

Will -limiting a leadership» pro-
gram to a small number of students
give some students advantages over
others?. '

“No, I don’t think‘ so,” Brown
“I don’t think we're
trying to say A is better than B.
However, we do want to give
students some skills that are impor-
tant in leading groups, like develop-
ing communication skills and learn-
ing dynamics. I don’t think it’s go-
ing to put one student ahead‘ of
another in that sense,” he said.

The instructors for the program
will include doctoralstudents from
the School of Education, and two
faculty members trained in counsel-
mg.

Allocating Student Fee Revenue’

With the doubling of the. ac-
tivities. fee to the current $24, the
SGB and its allocations committee
faced ‘the task of distributing ap-
proximately $570,000 of this
revenue to student organizations.

Abraham said the organizations
were satisﬁed “because the money
was plentiful.” 

However, Abraham indicated
that he would like to see a change in

' the allocations process, the method
‘by which student activity fee

revenue is distributed. ,

“One thing I think’ did cause a
problem’ this year is the fact that
our allocations committee invests
20, 30, 40 hours a week of their time
for about a three month period; it’s
very intense,” Abraham explained.

» “They know the groups, they know

the budgets, and when it comes
right down to it, all they've done in
that time is made a budget recom-
mendation, and the board, which is
basically removed from that pro-
cess, has to sit there and go through
each budget_ and make the
decision.” '

Abraham said he wouldprefer '

allowing the allocations committee
to make the initial decision on the
budget package, and allow the SGB
to act,-as an appellate board.

“I feel comfortable with the
allocation process and the alloca-
tions committee, so there’s really no
need for me to sit there at a public
meeting and work through I a
budge ,” he said. “If a group has a
problem with its budget and wants
to appeal it to the board, that would

give me‘ all that extra time to con-
centrate on that one or two or three
"or four appellate budgets.’..’
Board member Martin Bertocchi,
a junior political science major,
disagrees with Abraham and would
like’ to lessen the control of th
allocations comnﬁttee. *
“I think the allocations commit-
tee has too much control over the
final income of what people get,”

Bertocchi said. -’ ‘‘‘‘All through the

interview process and all through
the deliberations, we're not allowed
to find out what these groups are
telling our own allocations commit-
tee. The students who get the
money have no say in picking the
allocation members, so why? should
the allocations committee have the
ﬁnal say unless an appeal is made?”

Bertocchi said he would like to
see a system that '‘makes the SGB
better informed and more willing to
ask questions. - .

“To nre,that means lessening the
power of the allocations committee
and giving us greater access to the
information they’ve always had, in-

stead of making them stronger,”.

Bertocchi said.

Board member Walter Burke, a
senior labor relations major, said he
likes theidea of an appellate board.

“I think it’s a waste of time for
us _ to go. through all the budgets
when the allocations committee
knows what’s going on,” Burke
said.

Another board member, Janice
Faller, a senior political science ma-
jor, does not agree with Burke’s
idea.

not complete with only frat parties,

Hall. ‘For those who seek spiritual
"guidance, or need someone to help

_ straighten out their heads as Ifaras
religion is concerned, there are a

few options near campus.

The Cornerstone Fellowship is an

interdenominational Christian op-
tion, and Chabad House, directed
by Yosef Rosenberg, offers the Pitt
Jewish population a chance to ex-
perience the true meaning of
Judaism.

“Chabad House offers students a

chance to experience’ non-gefilte

ﬁsh-oriented Judaism. It’s not con-
servative, reform or orthodox but
embraces the eternal essence which
runs through all facets of Judaism,”
Rosenberg said.

“The majority of Jews have
almost been systematically denied
any real knowledge or experience of
of essential Judaism. In-depth,ex-
perience and understanding of the
Jewish lifestyle is lacking among the
majority of ‘American Jews. Few
could even answer who or what is a

Riscoe, BAS? chairperson.

At the time of BAS’s inception in
1968 “there wasn't enough com-
munity input at Pitt, and affir-
mative action wasn’t taking place,”
Riscoe said. ,

“The BAS wants to make sufe

“Chabad House stands ready to
ﬁeld questions in an open exchange
format, and \provides an ' at-
mosphere conductive to‘experienc-
ing the nitty\ gritty of the Jewish
lifestyle,” Rosenberg explained.
Kenneth Nagie, a Pitt student ac-
tive at,Chabad House, describes it
this way: “Chabad House is an
avenue to learn about and fulﬁll
your spiritual identity. People
come to college to learn about the
world and themselves. This educa-
tion can’t ignore the spiritual
growth of the person. For a Jew,
this means learning more about
their Jewish side. Chabad House
provides a stimulating‘environment

‘ in which to challenge and explore

all avenues of a person’s being.” ’

“II want Jewish people to not
throw the baby out with the bath
water. They shouldn't reject what
they don’t know. Judaism has to be
experienced. Community and family all
wrapped up into a tidy package—-
that’s the Judaism that I’m talking
about and that’s the Judaism that
most of us never experience,”
Rosenberg said.

fourth floor of the Jewish com-
munity center on South Bellefield
Avenue. Classes in Jewish

the rights of the black student are
upheld,” she explained. Riscoe
said that “all blacks are members”
of BAS, and since 15 to 20 percent
of Pitt’s black students are from the

surrounding area, BAS has a strong

link with the Pittsburgh communi-
ty. .
The executive committee of BAS
consists of chairperson Riscoe,

deputy chairperson Andrew,

and _ “Chews and

program are all part of the Chabad
House activities schedule.

The Christian perspective of
youth spirit growth is the concern
of the interdenominational Cor-
nerstone Fellowship, an organiza-
tion which meets on Wednesdays at
the Bellefield Presbyterian Church.

Cornerstone, according to Stacy

»Gidas, who is one of the coor-

dinatorsof. the program, “aims at
helping Christian students mature

in their reading of the scripture as it , ‘

pert-ains to all areas of their life.

We are of the opinion that the .

Christian faith affects all areas of a

person’s life. Weare committed to ‘

sharing the ‘Christian faith with
those seeking a living faith.

“We have a number of programs
in the desire to meet the social, in;

‘By MARY KANDRAY ,

The Cathedral of Learning is pro-
bably the most visible and im-

pressive symbol of the University of
‘Pittsburgh. The 535-foot structure

is centrally located within the cam-
pus and is a. registered historical
landmark. It is hard to believe’ that I
this dominant structure almost was
not built; in fact, it would not have
been thought of if it had not been

-for the inspiration of Chancellor

John G. Bowman.
Bowman became a part of the

"University in 1920 when, after

speaking’ in Pittsburgh as director

-of the American College of

Surgeons, he was invited by the
university trustees to become the
tenth chancellor of the University.
‘When Bowman became chan-
cellor, the University lacked three»

‘-"things: space, money and reputa-

tion. The campus consisted of a
group of low buildings and wooden
structures clinging to the hillside
near Alumni Hall; the ﬁnances con-
sisted of an almost two million
dollar debt; and the citizens of
Pittsburgh knew so little about the
University that a streetcar operator
whom Bowman asked for directions
on his first trip to Pitt, had never
heard of the University.
Bowman determined_ that
order to expand ,Pitt’s space and
reputation, he would need capital-.
He immediately began fundraising
to settle the debt and begin a
building fund. In the meantime, he
sent John Weber, _ professor of

‘mechanical engineering, on a tour

of American universities to find out
how much space would be needed.

It was decided that an additional
13 million cubic feet of space would

. be required to accommodate the

University’s expanding student
body. Bowman then decided that

"the University’s ﬁnancial -~ needs

were in the area of $15 million. This
figure shocked the trustees who had

"been struggling‘ to raise $100,000,

‘ i.-which was the interest due‘ on Pitt’s
- loan.‘ Bowman looked "to Mellon»

Bank President Richard B. Mellon

. for guidance in his quest and found

plan, then tfy to sell it.”

A block from the University was
a site which seemed -ideal for such a
tower, the 14-acre lot known as
Frick Acres. ‘ At the time, the lot
was on the market and about to be
sold. Now frantic, Bowman per-

Again Bowman looked to the

Mellons for assistance. Andrew’

Mellon, then Secretary of State,
was the only man who could im-

»mediately grant the $3.5 million '

necessary for the purchase -of Frick

Bowman traveled to Mellon’s office
in‘ Washington, D.C.
at least once a week.

The Secretary did not tumon the
lights. Hours had gone by‘ as
though they were minutes. Then
Mr. Mellon walked close to me,
stopped; and said in a low friendly
tone, ‘I accepted an invitation to
dinner tonight. _It is too late not to
go. My brother and I will give the
land. You are the most persistent
man I‘have ever seen.’

Architectural Problems

Bowman hired Charles Klauder
of Philadelphia, one of the leading
Gothic architects _in the country, to‘
build his tower which was to be a
marriage. between the inspiring”
medieval cathedral and the modern
skyscraper. _

The two consulted for almost two
years, trying to translate Bowman’s

mental pictures of the tower into a
workable sketch. Although
Bowman had -great respect for
Klauder’s credentials, he rejected
sketch after sketch.

Finally, in an all-night session in
Klauder’s Philadelphia home, the
two produced the concept and
sketch that they had been searching

tired. For the first time after two
years of effort it seemed that‘ we
had made a start.’ ” .
Bowman. wanted his dream tower
to contain a grand Commons
Room, 100 x 200 feet in area and at
least 60 feet high; the -roomwas, to.
be entirely made of stone. Klauder
wanted the; stone for the vaulted
ceiling of the Commons Room to be

. slipped onto iron clothespins. He

claimed that the stones would look
exactly like solid masonry. .
“But those - arches would be

. sham. They would be frauds,”
. Bowman retorted.

Klauder pointed out that solid
stonework would waste a
least $100,000. ' '

“Let's not argue,” said
Bowman. “You cannot build
a great university with a

' fraud in it.” _

The Fund Raising Ctrmpaign
' « While Klauder was refining

his design, Bowman‘ began
his fund raising campaign.
' \He contacted corporations,
and individuals,
and conducted a
public fund raising
- campaign. By
June of 1925,’
funds - pledged or

thousand schoolchildren con-
tributed to the campaign.
Although the fund raising cam-
paign wasgwell-underway, Bowman
was meeting with opposition from
"the board of trustees and other
groups as late as October of 1925.
Many of the trustees had an ivy-
covered university in mind. ’ Some
civic groups felt that the tower
would spoil the Oakland landscape.

There were worries about. swaying A

guished these worries; however, the
board of» trustees passed a resolu-

tion that no building higher than
100 feet could be erected on the ‘

campus. The day after the resolu-
tion was passed, Bowman went to
see Richard Mellon. Bowman told
the executive, “I’ve come on an

unusual errand; I’m asking no ques- -

tions, I do not expect a reply. 1 br-

ing merely some information. I’m
‘ going ahead at once with the‘con-

struction of the high building.”

As Bowman turned to leave,
Mellon asked, “Wait a minute. Do
you mean what you say?”

“Yes.” I

“Mr. Mellon laughed heartily-

said.”

On September 27, 1926, with no ‘

public announcement, the ground
breaking for thetower began. After
a steam shovel scooped out the
ground for -the first time, construc-
tion went on 24 hours a day so that
there could be no turning back.
At the next board of trustees"
meeting, Bowman wasconfronted.
“We notice a building going _up
out there. Would you mind telling
us what that is?” ,
“That’s the building we’ve been
talking about all these years,” he
answered. Laughter ﬁlled the
room. Either through design or
resignation, the _ trustees "allowed
Bowman to continue with. his plan.
On October 21, 1929, the last steel

- . rive was driven in the frame of the

Cat edral. With the onset of the
Depression," work slowed down as
necessary funds became scarce. In
order to ensure the building’s com--
pletion, Bowman had the

stonework begun from the ﬁfth . ,

floor upward, knowing ~that ‘C . ,_
people of Pittsburgh would ‘not
allow the bottom of the Cathedral
to‘ go unﬁnished. ' O

, When the stonework reached the
top late in 1930 and the funds were
extremely low, the - remaining

- money was used to landscape the

grounds. This led to ridicule of the

3. college with the beautiful lawn 0

leading to an unfinished building.
Despite the hard times, Pitt— con-

after a year, the construction
resumed. By 1936, the Cathedral

(Continued from page 1)

Brinkley, 24,‘Ta Philadelphia con-
struction worker, was arraigned in
Pittsburgh last October 18 on
charges of killing Jones. I-Ie awaits
a hearing in October. ‘I

On the same day of Brinkley’s ar-
raignment, shortly beforeinidnight,
Pitt students celebrated the Pirates’
come-from-behind World Series
victory over the Baltimore Orioles.
However, baseball and booze were
not the only things on students’
minds in mid-October.

For one, _the university food serv-

ice, runby, Key Management Co.,
was under fire. A task force of

students was formed in late October
to investigate complaints about cold
and uncooked food,“ lack of variety
in menus, bones and glass in food,
and sour milk. In addition, the
Resident , Student Association’s
food service ' committee worked

with cafeteria management to try to. -

eliminate problems in the two din-
ing halls, located in the Towers and
Lothrop Hall.

June 1, however, marked the end
of Key Management’s operation of
Pitt cafeterias. The university an-
nounced that Dining and Kitchen
Administration, \ Inc. (daka) had
received the contract for 1980-81.

- ._. .. .. .— .-....-.. .... ..._. --

Although Auxiliary Services
Business Manager James Beavers
said student complaints played a
part in the change of management,
he added that bids had -not been
sent out to other food service com-
panies for five years.

Last y.ear’s management person-
nel and other cafeteria workers
have been ‘retained, Beavers said.

"Although the cafeteria staff ex-
perienced little turnover, a brand-
new group of Student Government
Board (SGB) members took office
last January. Despite their inex-
perience, Board President Bill
Abraham and the other-“eight rookie

board members finalized plans for
the expanded and now operating
campus bus route. They also pass-
ed a resolution supporting the black
studies department, whose founder
and _former chairman,
Porter, was denied tenure in a hotly
contested decision by Faculty of
Arts and Sciences Dean Jerome
Rosenberg. However, the student
Black Action Society was displeased
that Porter’s name was not part of
the resolution.

Pitt Crime Rises, But Precautions Can Be Taken    

By CLARE GLEASON
Pitt News Staff Writer '

‘A distant, if subconscious, ques-
tion lingering in the recesses of an
entering freshman’s mind must
surely be, “How safe is the Pitt
campus?” ‘ ‘

According tothe 1979 statistical
report published by the university
police, Pitt_’s “reported crime con-
tinued to rise in 1979 by 7.7 percent
over .”

The greatest number of reported
criminal incidents involved theft,
the report said. Of all crimes com.-

.mitted in 1979, 41.7 percent were
thefts. The second most frequently
committed criminal incident,
disorderly conduct, accounted for
13 percent of all crimes in 1979.

’ “The biggest thing is for people
not to leave their property unat-
tended,” Lt. Jim Watters of the

campus police said. “Don’t leave
purses at a desk when searching
through library stacks. Lock your
door even if you leave for a very
short time. Entire stereosystems
have been carried out while the vic-
tim has been on the same“ ﬂoor.”
Overall, the residence hall area
was the leading zone for criminal
incidents, with 26.4 percent of
reported crime occurring in the
vicinity of the dorms and the stu-
dent union, Watters said. Disorder-
ly conduct accounted for nearly

half of the dorm arrests termed ..

“high person activities,” crimes oc-
curring in high-density area.

— “Dormitories are theliighest con-
centration of resident population; it
would follow that the majority of
crimes occur where the majority of
people are,” Watters said.

pectively of all reported incidents.‘ '
“Crimes of violence are certainly
not a new phenomena in our socie-

ty,” Watters said. “Individuals
always have the potential to be the
 of some crime regardless ‘of
their locale. At Pitt‘, the possibility
of that victimization exists, but it is
certainly a very random and seldom
seen problem. ‘ T

-“Individuals need to learn the
university community and the areas
that should be avoided,” the lieute-
nant added. “When they are travel-
ing anywhere, anytime, they shoulii
stick to heavily trafficked areas
and, whenever feasible, have some-»
one accompany them.”

According to Watters, one of the
biggest problems on campus is that
neonle are afraid to call the police. V

“Just because the police are call-

ed doesn’t mean people will be in ’

trouble,” he said. “There are
numerous things police can do

a direct line to the police station.

ward, Martin Bertocchi, Al Mele
and Janice Faller all sewed » on
standing committees before being
elected to the board. Last term the
current board voted to change the
process by which chairmen of these
committees are selected. Previous-
ly, standing committee members
elected their own chairmen. How-
ever, the SGB bylaws now state that
chairmen are chosen by an ad hoc
committee composed of three
members of the SGB and three
members of the particular standing
committee. _

“We have left every office in the
standing committee, except chair-I
person, up to the internal decision
of the group,” according to
Abraham. /V

“About. the only thing we have
done is we have decided to appoint
the chairperson,” Abraham said.
“One reason was to heighten the
communication between the board
and the standing committee, and

the other reason was that probably -
a very key. person’ in the standing -
"‘committee is the chairperson. We

offer a lot of services through the
standing committees and we felt

,Bylows, Other Student I

that the boardshould ultimately be
held responsible, in that we are
elected officials, for the activities of
the standing committees, and
therefore, we need to have some
type of responsible wing of the
committees.” _

Abraham said that he would like
to experiment with the process of
appointing of chairmen . for one
year. - s

“I know there are still com-
plaints, mainly from standing com-
mittee people, but I just want to
give it a chance,” Abraham said.

Senior political science major
Bernadette Herward, a former
chairman of the student govern-
ment commuter affairs committee,
has indicated that changing the
bylaws is one of her goals for this
term. -

“The bylaws as they are set down

now, aren’t really uniform,” Her-
ward explained, “because you have
a committee like the commuter af-
fairs committee and it’s just not go-
ing to work there.

“They're the students who come
and go as they please, there’s really

“I know the committee itself is
upset about this because they know
some of the ‘problems that they’d
had before. The board might see
this person and forget that we know
this other person can do the job,
and they really don’t feel that the
board can make the judgment that
they can make, and I don’t,either,”
she said. Herward said that she
and some other board members
have some ideas on changing the
bylaws. _

“We would give the committees
some say in who their chairman is,”
she explained. “Let -the committee
‘nominate three people who they
feel would do a good job and then
have the board pick from them.
That way, you give the committees

,a say in who is going to be their
chairman.” __ ,

Walter Burke said he believes the
responsibility of choosing a chair-
man remains with the board,
because the committees are a func-
tioning arm of the board, and have
certain responsibilities.

“We would want to make sure
that the people who are placed there
know the responsibility and know

how to cope with it, regardless of ,

who likes who,” Burke said.
“The ‘one thing that I think was

kind of a.failure, to be very frank’

about it, was in drawing them up,”
Burke commented. “But I think
one of the things that happened was
that it was written and was approv-
ed and then it seemed rather heavy
handed. I have to admit it seemed
‘heavy handed because none of the
committees were asked for their in-
put.”

Bertocchi agreed that more input
was needed from the committees. ‘-
_ “We’re going to have to sit down
and talk to these people, because
what they decide gives us an indica-
tion of what they want,” Bertocchi

said. “I think we should do it a lot ‘

betterthan we did last time, when
we didn’t ask anybody.”

, A visitation
policy was implemented this sum-
mer, prompting some members to
call for a return to last years less

restricted visitation rules. The con-’
-troversial new policy states, among

other things, that no overnight
guests "are permitted on weekdays.
An overnight guest is defined as one
who ‘remains in a room between 2
a.m. and 8 a.m. Monday through
Friday, and overnight ' guests .must
be of the same sex as the resident of
the room. All visitors are required
to sign in and sign out,‘ and have to
be escorted by the host while in the
building.

“People complained terribly,“
according to Janice Faller, who

- lived in Tower C over the summer.

“The desk attendants call you and
wake you up. at two
morning.” ,

According to the new policy, if
you donot escort your guest to the
security desk, do not sign him out
correctly, or. commit some other of-

fense, you are sent a letter of warn- .

ing. On the next offense, you
receive a second letter and are sent
to the Office of Residence Life for a
reprimand. On the third offense,

you go to the Judicial Board, who -

tries your case. _

A change in the visitation policy
is a goal of Bernadette Herward’s
this term. Other goals vary among
the members. Walter Burke would
like to set up the $6000 printing

 An   ﬁve

  Orientation

Virtually all undergraduate students at the Univer-

sity of Pittsburgh have attended an ‘orientation, '
' ’ much like the one that this year’s crop of freshmen
:are experiencing now. The program, designed to

familiarize new students with "Pitt officialdom, is
essential for the kid just out of high school and on his
or her own for the first time. ' ‘ .
Surely, most students would agree‘ that their orien-
tation program answered countless questions ranging

from how to register for classes to where to apply for

student aid. But there are many things that the of-

'‘ ficial orientation does not tell the new student. What-
follows are some tidbits designedto set the freshmen

straight and unfortunately, to dispel certain altruistic
assumptions about dear old Pitt.
_ Take a good look at Chancellor Posvar during the

freshman reception, because for many of you, it will '

be the last time you see him. As a matter of fact,

-some of you who do not attend the reception will

never see Posvar; Perhaps "we are being ’a bit
facetious. "However, it. is true that the chancellor

' keeps a very low profile partially due to his time- .
. demanding job and also his style of managing the

university. -' '
Pitt is much like the federal government in that it is
a large sloth-like bureaucracy. Everyone will ‘ex-

. perience Pitt’s red tape one time or another. Take

paying tuition, for example. Those who do not pay

A for credits by mail must wait in long lines to do so. It

seems backward to stand in line to give someone else

your money, but that’s Pitt for you. s
College really is not as hard as some educators say

it is. That is not to say academics at Pitt are below

‘ par. What” the statement means is that if the average

student attends most classes faithfully and does some

, work, he or she will earn adiploma. There are some

exceptions to the rule, but most students who follow
that advice will pass with few problems.

All students are not created equal. In fact, some
students are more equal than others. The collegiate

l world, and the “real world” around us are much the
same. Some students, due to their elected office or.
social peer group, are accorded privileges not '

available to the normal student. Politics among
students? ‘ Just like anywhere elsein this world,

power pays off and politics is the motivation for
many actions. ; .

A large percentage of your classmates will not
make it through four years of college. Students leave
Pitt for any number of reasons. One reason is poor
academic performance or as it is known to college

students throughout the country, ﬂunking out. Some 0’

students party to extremes and neglect the minimum
requirements needed to pass their courses. Others
simply are not meant for academia and washout
before graduation. But whatever the reasons, some
students just do not survive college life.

Pitt has the best football team in the country
Those of you who have rooted for (Penn State
throughout your formative. years better get that
straight. Suggest to a Panther fan that the Nittany
Lions may defeat Pitt, and you’ll hear a string of ex-
pletives that cannot be printed in any newspaper.

Pitt is not a bad place to spend four years (some, in
‘fact, spend five or six). '

Experience as much of the academic, extra-
curricular and social life as you can here and life in
Oakland will besatisfying and most of the time, in-
vigorating. At any rate, The Pitt.News wishes the
class of 1984 good luck and much success andshap-
piness in the years to come.

 H‘A\KE’ 

‘Yea, it's kinda boring...but it pays well for a work/study job...’

By TODD NARVOL

~ When it comes to stress, there’s
the constant increase in tuition.

K There’s the steady grind of going to

classes and studying. And then
there’s the omnipresent merciless
bureaucracy, the endless barrage of
carbon copy forms, the time-des-
troying lines in student accounts,
financial aid and‘ registration.
You've become the human-counter-
part of a nine-digit number on a

, computer system.

It’s easy to complain about the
bureaucracy and curse it. But keep-
ing track of over 35,000 people at
the university is a mammoth task
and the administrative management
and staff deserve respect for their

diligence andconstant planning and
reorganizing over the years. (Im-
aginehow much less efficient the

bureaucracy was before it was com-

puterized.) _ I
_ You must realize that the forms
are necessary and the lines are

. unavoidable. But, there will be a’

time (or two or three) when a staff
worker, or you, will bungle a tech-
_nicality* during . a bureaucratic en-
counter and you’ll be penalized a

headache and_ a couple, of hours.
Consider a story told to me by a ‘

friend.‘ _ 
‘She had taken a bus to campus

 from Penn_‘Hills a couple of rainy

Fridays ago. Her mission was to go
to thepayroll office and obtain a
staff scholarship forrn—her father

is employed by the university and is
thereby entitled to free tuition for
his dependent children—and take
it, along with her fall tuition bill, to
student accounts. However, when
she arrived at the payroll office, she
found that it had closed the day
before for relocation. A moving
notice on the door said the office
would open the following Tuesday
at its new location, at 8:00 a.m.
When Tuesday rolled around, she
—rode a bus into Oakland at 10:00
a.m. and walked into the payroll of-
fice. It was open.-
worker redirected her to the
_ benefits ofﬁce down the hall, which
wasn't opening until noon.
She killed two hours in Oakland
and returried to the benefits office,

But a staff. '

where she was finally able to oBi‘é‘in

the form. She filled it out, gaveiit ‘

to a staff worker; the staff wo'rker

filled it out, gave it back, and she"

was on her way to paying\her fall
tuition.

There were about sixty people
waiting in line in student accounts
for four cashiers’ windows—she
would be hours away from the final
transaction. - Luckily, a staff
worker by the door was "analyzing
each person's situation, ~ and since
she had no business other than pay-
ing her bill outright with the
scholarship note, she was allowed
to go tolan express window.-L There
was only one person in line.

Four minutes later, she received a

    Column/A Victim of Pitt’s Omnipresent Bureaucracy ~

fall term validation sticker for her
I.D. card and it was smooth sailing
from there. Well, not quite. Tlvtv
scholarship ‘form had a carbon cont.
still attached that should have beeh
retained by the" benefits office, and

had to be mailed or delivered back. “

After she left student ‘accounts,
she passed the old payroll office
and reread the moving notice. She
had misinterpreted it initially; the
office had been divided into five
branches, each with _a different
scheduled opening time. She
should have realized that she
wanted “Benefits” not just plain
“Payroll” as it used to be called.

She took some aspirin and walked ii

to the bus stop.’

thousands of feet high in the
California Sierra and I’m trying to
imagine what to say to people
beginning a stay at Pitt. I
remember the first advice I got
from an upperclassman. I was

0' heading for matriculation when a
‘ sophomore (who, strangely enough,

wrote a column for the newspaper)
shouted, “Going to matriculate?”
I nodded. '
“Don’t let your father catch
you!” ,
Joe, the advice-giver, never wrote
so strangely. .
I suppose I should let you know
“Who’s Who” around the campus.

Starting at the top, Wesley Posvar‘
, is at the top. You might be able to
see him up there with binoculars. If
 saw him «once.  i‘*—'e_ forgzitten

what he looked like.. He’s called
Chancellor, if you’re standing in
front of him—an unlikely position
for a freshman or any other stu-

dent. . .or faculty member. . .or .

_ just about anyone else. “Uncle
Wes” is our term of endearment for
the fearless leader. ' I
‘ The University is actually run by
the Senior Vice Chancellor, whose
name is a secret. This man is mis-
labeled, since his primary objective
seems to be tondiscourage vice on
campus. ' I

Andy Smith is lurking somewhere
in the higher echelons of Pitt-dom.
Andy’s full of surprises’ and less
visible than Wes. But it’s>tough to
joke about somethings. By reading

Let‘s stop moaning over the ad-
ministration and take a few stabs at
the faculty. The star of the teaching
end is Ted Windt. Ted is from
Texas, a fact you’ll quickly discover
if you’re in the same room with
him. I first met Ted in the stddios
of KQV-radio, where he was a guest
on a talk show I produced. I only
remember that he had dark glasses
and a painfully strong handshake.
‘Ted teaches “Presidential

(Lyndon Johnson creeps in to

visited by television crews and

teach, since it would interfere with
his speaking schedule. _ .

To the Editor,

Governor Thornburgh is unwise-
lyi holding the appropriations for
state-related institutions, including
Pitt, as the hostage in his political
feud with the Liquor Control Board
and the State House of Represen-
tatives. 

Increased costs of the university
should not be the sole burden of the
students. Those increased costs
must be shared equitably between

the Commonwealth and the institu- ‘

tion. Increased tuition, as we have
experienced in the ‘past few years

 éﬂﬁfld the planned increase in

January, thwarts the university's
ability to provide the level of quali-

ty education which is required to»

make the Commonwealth of Penn-

. sylvania a strong and developing

state. _ A

In the A past eight years, as a
Member of the State House, and
now, as a state senator," I have con-
sistently supported sufficient levels
of state appropriations for all of the
state-related institutions. I have

; also supported the necessary taxes
. and fees to pay for those appropria-

tions. _

It is essential for the state-related
institutions, students and ad-
minstration, to not only lobby for
the appropriations, but also to sup-

-liiport the necessary revenue produc-

ing measures._, This year, the
revenue producing legislation is an
increase in administrative‘ fees and
increases in liquor charges. I have
already indicated my support to
Governor‘ Thomburgh for the fee

, legislation, and Liquor Control
Board Chairman Pennick has in- .

tdicated liquor pricejncreases will be
forthcoming. S

State Treasurer Casey has wisely
indicated that no abatement of ap-
propriations to thestate-related in-

Q stitutions, including Pitt, will occur

until the"f'mal payment of the ap-
propriation. This action will pro-

vide the General ‘Assembly suffi-
cient time to ‘interccde in Governor
Thomburgh’s proposed action of a
ten percent reduction in non-
preferred appropriations, and to
provide sufficient funds for all the
state-related and non-preferred ap-
propriations. It is, however, vital
that the state-related institutions,
administration, faculty, students
and alumni, act" together to move

expeditiously prior to the fall elec-

tion recess and in support of these
revenue producing measures.

It is also- important that Pitt
students from other areas of the
Commonwealth work diligently to
bring their hometown legislators in
line and supportive of the revenue
producing actions. Allegheny

County legislators, acting alone,
‘cannot produce the necessary funds -
’ for Pitt, but need the active and ag-

gressive support of Pitt: students _ ’
and alumni who live throughout the

Commonwealth. ' - . 4

To the Editor, V I

During my twelve years in the
General Assembly, I have con-
sistently voted in favor of non-
preferred appropriations for Penn-
sylvania’s state-related colleges and
universities. I was Vice Chairman
of the Senate Education Committee
during my first term as State
Senator, and ‘I continue to be a
member of that committee.

I have always considered educa-
tion to be the single most important
priority of state government, since
the future of our state and, indeed,
our country depends on our young
people being able to receive a
sound, economical education. You
may be assured that I will continue
to support legislative proposals
which would provide funding for

' institutions of higher education.

Pennsylvania’s state-related
universities have developed national
reputations for excellence in a wide

variety of areas and I wholehearted- ' '

ly believe that they represent the
most efficient means of providing
top quality education that is affor-
dable and accessible to a large
number of students.

Traveling across the state, I have

' beenimpressed, by the young people

attending colleges in*Pennsylvania.‘
They are enthusiastic, caring young
men and women who take pride in
their schools and their state. I have
hired many students from state
universities to serve as interns on
my staff; ‘and recently, a Pitt
graduate was a full-tirnemember of
my . staff for more than a year
before going on to work elsewhere
in the Legislature. I am always im-
pressed with the ability and com-
petency of these young men and
women. ‘ ‘

Naturally, I hope the state-
related universitiesiwill be able to
maintain their high standards of ex-
cellence which have been a source’
of pride not only for students», but
for all Pennsylvanians as well.

I share your concern about the re-
cent tuition increase; in view of the
hard economic times’ which are

Friday, August 29, 1980-Page1S

upon us all, but hit hardest those

whocan least afford it—such as the
senior citizens and the students;

More importantly, I am concern-
ed about the quality of our institu-
tions—quality which may gradually
deteriorate if the state fails to at
least maintain its present financial
commitment to our schools.

I am outraged at the recent at-
tempt by the Thornburgh Ad-
ministration to hold our ‘state
universities and their students
hostage, by threatening to withhold
appropriations for the schools, if
the Liquor Control Board failed to
meet its demands and pass a ten-
cent per bottle fee. It was un-
necessary and inappropriate for the
Governor to involve the schools in
his battle with the LCB. Be assured
that I will oppose any cuts in ap-
propriations for state universities. B

_ . “By comparison to the more

students tend more readily to stop-

strongly career-oriented and highly

An estimated. $564,248 in stu-
dent activity fee money will be
spent this school year on student
organizations, publications, and
social ' and recreational pro-
grams, according to Director-._of
Student Activities, Andy Smith.
The undergraduate activity
fee, $24 for full-time non-
College of General Studies
students and $8 for part-time
students, is a separate line item
on students’ tuition statements.
The university sets the fees
through the -board of trustees.
The board will not raise them.
unless they are petitioned by the
student constituency to do so,
he added. . H
The fee, raiscdxlast February
by the board of trustees, had
been $12 for'full-time students
and $4 for part-time since 1966.
“Student organizations were
ﬁghting .for the money because
of inﬂation. I was very suppor-
tive. of the increase because of

With a national championship and an undefeated season eluding
the Pitt Panther football team for three years, folks are once again
talking» about Bourbon Street, the Heisman, and practicing up on
chanting “We’re number one!” _

Pittsburgh is buzzing again about another possibletop notch
team. Following last year’s Pirate win in the World Series and the
Steelers’ Super Bowl win and continued excellence, this year's Pitt
squad is being touted as the next name. to add to the list of winners in
the “City of Champions.” , q '

Pitt has been ranked anywhere from number onebto six in various
preseason polls in‘ magazines across the country. The Panthers are

once again ready to join the ranks of the Alabamas, Nebraskas and

Southern Cals for football supremacy in the United States. A
And what about that Heisman? At least one local writer has given
senior defensive end-. Hugh _Green an outside shot at becoming the
first defensive player ever to win the coveted award. In fact, rumor
has it that Green will be featured on the front cover of Sports 11-
-lustrated’s college football preview issue. Pitt ‘fans who are

superstitious are getting out their anti-jinx formulas_to ward off ‘the
supposed curse on players (or teams) who adorn the cover of that
magazine. - - ’ ‘

Those same superstitious folks are also talking about the coin-
cidence that it took Johnny Majors four years to win the big one and
this just happens to be Jackie Sherrill’s fourth‘ season. Stranger
things have happened. And speaking of Johnny Majors, he will be
the foe this season for the first time since he left Pitt to take on the

' chore of rebuilding the Tennessee football program. Pitt will meet

Tennessee in Knoxville on Oct. 25 in one of the biggest tests of the
season. I - -
The only other teams that Pitt may have a tough time with are
Maryland, Florida State, and traditional riyals’West Virginia (only
because of the‘ rivalry) and Penn State. The rest of the schedule
looks like a virtual cakewalk for a team of Pitt's potential and
caliber. Squads from Boston College, Temple and Army are scat-
tered among Kansas, Louisville and Syracuse. All in all, not too

., toughof a schedule. -

Fifty lettermen return from an 11-1 team which won the Fiesta’
Bowl over Arizona 16-10 and was ranked sixth in one national poll.
Of those 50; 16, starters will be coming back, including Green, offeri-
sive tackle Mark May, tight end Benjie Pryor, fullback Randy “Big
Mac Attack” McMillan and quarterback Dan-Marina. Also return-
ing will bedefensive end Ricky Jackson, defensive tackles Bill Neill
and Greg Meisner, nose guard Jerry Boyarsky, center'Russ Grimm
and comerback Terry White.

Football games are a social happening at Pitt as they are at most
major universities, and Pitt students are eagerly awaiting another
whining season. »'_I‘hose students who are seniors now can remember
no other kind of season and just missed the 1976 national champion-

Pitt Matmen Lookfor Better Season

By ANNA ARLOTTA
Pitt News Sports Writer ,.
When thefirst mats of wrestling-

season are rolled out next
November, there will be serious
concentration placed on reboun-
ding from a dismal year of 1979-80.
Pitt actually began its task of
rebuilding the lineup and finding

A just the right combination from 118

pounds to_ -heavyweight that will

produce a winning season when ‘

coach Randy Stottlemeyer took the
position of head coach a year ago.
Both Stottlemeyer and Coach,
Chuck Coryea have had a taste of
All-America status in their col-
legiate wrestling days. While at
Pitt, under former coach Dave
Adams, Stottlemeyer was a three
time All-American athlete for the
Panthers. Coryea also placed
himself in the AH—America ranks
while‘ at Clarion State College, a
- powerhouse_in' collegiate wrestling.
The season past showed a" Pan-
ther team that was\ going through

many pains, both the figurative 

pain of growing into a successful
‘unit and the physical pain of in-
juries. A young team with only two
seniors, Ed Bedniak and Steve
“Smokey” Smocharski, found
Bredniak unable to wrestle the en-
tire season due to a severely injured
thumb. Bredniak was looked upon

in the preseason to be a qualifier for _,

the NCAA tournaments. Unfor-

record when they ran the event in
3:13 at the Penn State Invitational.

Octavius Burnnet is a junior col-
lege transfer from Mesa, Arizona.
Originally from Harrisburg, he was
an All-American in the 200-meter

tunately, the injury terminated
Bredniak’s wrestling~career.

Except for Smocharski in the
heavyweight position, the entire

' Panther lineup of last season will

return with the addition of some
fine freshman recruits. Stot-

' tlemeyer and Coryea believe that

they have had a very successful year
of recruiting for the Panthers.

“We’ve been able to getia .

number of ‘athletes with great
credentials\ out of high school,”
Stottlemeyer said. “We know that
we can’t count on these young
wrestlers to carry the team through
entirely, but they will be the icing‘
on the cake in a lineup that we
believe will come back strong.”
Looking at the incoming
freshmen, two from Western Penn-
sylvania, which is a’ high school
wrestling hotbed, have much poten-
tial to fit right into the Panther
lineup and contribute to a winning
year. . _ . .
Joe Throckmorton of nearby
Waynesburg High School, a-

-.powerhouse in the area and Jeff

Jelic of Mt. Lebanon have decided.

- to continue their athletic careers as

Panthers, bringing a-good deal of
experience to- Pitt despite their
freshman status. Throckmorton
was a Pennsylvania state champion

_in 1980 and Jelic was a runnerup in

the championship bouts held last

run with a time of 21.1.

In hisfirst year of seriously runn-
ing the 800-and 3100-meter events,
Garland Brown o_f Baltimore,
Maryland saw some great improve-
ment in his times of previous years.

of the 1979-80 campaign for Pitt as
they defeated» the Blue and Gold
65-63 in a typical Pitt-Duquesne
game;
Pitt’s 6’7” forward Sammie Ellis, .

who graduated last spring, finished
the season third inthe Eastern Eight

"iSam Clancy shows where he got his nickname, “Slam Bam.”

 

All-America candidate Sam “Slam
Bhm” Clancy (6’6”, 235 lbs.) rank-
ed first in the conference in reboun-
ding, averaging 11.1 bounds a
game. Clancy also averaged 11.8
points a game. ,

The assist man last year was point
guard Dwayne Wallace. He placed
second in the Eastern Eight in
assists, averaging 4.2 a contest.

The outside shooting ‘was
solidified by All" East candidate
Carlton Neverson. His 51.4 percent
from theufield was good enough to
place him, seventh in the league in
that department. The walk-on
from Elmira College averaged 12.8
points every 40 minutes.

But that was last season. Some
new faces’ will be on hand this year
when the Panthers take the_ ﬂoor at
Fitzgerald, Field House Nov. 29
against St. Francis. At the top of
the list is new head coach Roy Chip-

man, who came to Pitt following,

Grgurich’s resignation at the con-
clusion of last year’s campaign.

Chipman, 41, has been coaching
on the collegiate level for 12 years,
nine of them being with Hartwick
College in New York and the last‘
three with Lafayette College. His
12-year coaching record is an
unbelievable 226-83.

-The native of Cleveland, Ohio led:

the Lafayette Leopards to an NIT
bid last season: He also produced
two East Coast Conference“cham-'
pionships for the Leopards. Even
Hartwick received seven NCAA
post-season bids with Chipman at
the helm. -

Pitt’s 10th head basketball coach
brings with him not only a winning
record but also three assistant
coaches that he deems winners.
They are Reggie Warford, Seth
‘Greenberg, and, Dave Progar. A

Warford, known as an excellent
recruiter, was a former guard at
Kentucky under Joe B. Hall, and
for the last four years served as
assistant coach at Iowa State.

An assistant coach at Columbia
University the past two years,
Greenberg is also respected for his
basketball and recruiting talents.

Those are a few of the new faces

that will be seen on the Pitt bench‘

come hoop season; There will be
some new faces on the floor as well.

Steve Beatty of Slippery Rock, Pa.,
6’7” Brett Crawford from San

 Vaugn averaged about 35 points

High School Coaches Association.

Vaugn shot an amazing 71 percent-

from the field as a senior. Touted
nationwide by over 100 schools
Chipman ‘and Pitt were fortunate to‘
land one of the top five forwards
out of high school this year. '
Beatty’s height could also help
the Panthers - immediately. '~ The
forward from Slippery Rock High
averaged 21.7 points and almost 16
boards a game in his senior year.

'His field goal percentage was an

outstanding 62 percent. _
“A1l—California” was the honor

given to Crawford by Basketball

Weekly last season. The Roirdan

_ High School graduate averaged 22

points and 16 rebounds a game.
Swing man Crawford won honors
of All-Bay Area, All-San Francisco,
All League and All-Northern
California. in both his junior and
senior years. ' ‘
Guard Charles Williams had a
knee ailment at a junior college last
season_ but now, healthy as ever,

comes to Pitt with four full years of,

eligibility. Williams got his diploma
at Forest Park High where he
averaged 20 points and 16 rebounds
a contest. Williams is-very quick;
according to Chipman, he will be a
real crowd pleaser at the guard posi-
tion, A fine leaper, Williams was
All-League and All-Cincinnati in
his senior year. ‘

As the ‘ basketball Panthers

While a number of Panther

' athletic teams were having their ups
‘ and downs during their respective

seasons last year, the Pitt men’s
volleyball team rose from the very
bottom of collegiate competition to’
the top, of the ladder and gained a
very respectable reputation in
Eastern volleyball ranks along the
way. I .

Under the instruction of first year

. head coach Ray Reilly and veteran

Mike Hebert (head coach of the
women’s squad), the Panthers clin-
in the Eastern
playoffs. Two years prior to that,
with Hebert. at the helm, the men
spikers were not even cofnsidered a

varsity team. The Panthers had to"

settle with “club” status, although
the team fared well in every tourna-
ment in which they participated.
One year ago the Panthers were
given the opportunity to become a
part of Pitt’s list of varsity squads.
Still they were not an official
member in a solid NCAA division,
only an associate member. The
Panthers ﬁnished 9-21 and looked
eagerly to‘ the season of 1980.

Within the past _six months, the
City of Pittsburgh and Allegheny
County have been very successful in
exposing local sports fans to some
top qua1ity-soccer. The most par-
ticipated and watched sport in the
world has finally made a winning
mark in the area. The Pittsburgh
Spirit of the Major Indoor Soccer
League broke an MISL record for
most consecutive wins and went to
the playoffs in its sophomore year
of existence. And, only recently, an
international soccer tournament
called “Allegheny 80” ‘brought
teams from all around the globe
and the States to compete in an all-
star young tournament. “

The problem now lies in the link
between youth soccer and the pro-
fessional ranks. With Pitt being the
largest local university with the
most extensive athletic ‘ﬁibfgtéittﬁh
the area, many look to the Panthers

ed the year optimistically and began ‘

- winning matches. The long string of
wins in conference matches never
did end. The Panthers not only
took Division II conference honors
over but did so with an unmarred
slate. In one short year the Panthers
clinched the Division II top honors
and an automatic berth into the
Eastern Collegiate Volleyball
League playoffs. .

Success did not stop with only a
berth into the tournaments. The
Panthers opened up even more eyes
of volleyball followers when they
displayed their fine play in the
weekend tournament at Princeton,
coming home with a third place
finish behind Division 1. teams
Rutgers-Newark and Penn State.
Certainly an impressive feat.

Three Panther starters received
even ‘further honors at the conclu-
sion of the season by being named
to the ECVL all-star squad.
Freshman middle blocker Don Har-
din and setter Dave Baird, along
with senior hitter Jeff Beavers were
honored for their fine performances

. throughout tl" undefeated season.
. Beavers, the only Panther to

‘ named MVP of the Panthers for the

as being that missing link. But with
a record of 5-8-2 last fall a number
of people wonder if the Panther
booters will ever be able to fill the
expectations for a quality soccer
,program in the collegiate level.
Some go straight '.to’ the top and
place the - blame on the entire

athletic program. Others say the
blame lies with the team. Maybe the‘

most logical way is to say that the
blame lies with both.

Whatever the ‘case the Panther
booters will try to open up their
1980 season to the tune of an old
saying that goes, “If at first you
don't succeed, try try again.”
Under the instruction of head coach
Leo Bemis the Panthers will look to
a four game exhibition schedule to
iron out the wrinkles. before open-
ing the regular season of play on the

second consecutive year."
Pitt opened up their season with

an early preliminary attraction in

September against a touring squad
from the Physical Academy of.
Olsztyn in Poland. The Panthers
were able to get a taste of competi-
tion with some international flavor
before the season opening. Accor-
ding to Reilly and Herbert, the

competition from Poland was an -

experience for their spikers togo up '
against. The Panthers did not fare ._
too badly although losing the best_
of five match. The experience was
had and the groundwork was laid
on what techniques needed’ to be
worked on in the months to come.
Coming on strong for the Pan-
were ~ returnees Ricky
Camacho and Brian Devine. Both
spikers played well and- contributed

, to the outcome of the 1980 season.

Devinecould be said to be the most
improved player of a year ago. The
tall, lanky athlete was hampered
throughout the entire season by a
number of injuries,but played the
full year without sitting out. His
play over a, year ago improved 100

percent and placed him in a role

that will be looked upon to put the
Panthers into still another suc-
cessful .year, their third time
around.

test l-0. _ _
- Exhibition play will begin on

' August 28 with a game against a

local Keystone League squad of the
Pittsburgh Soccer Club. That game
will be followed on August 30 when

— West Virginia Wesleyan visits Pitt. \

Geneva will open up the month of
September on the 1st and the an-
nual Panther vs. Pitt alumni game
will take place at Pitt Stadium on

- September ‘3 at 9:00 p.m.

Bemis and his booters hope that
these four games will provide the
opportunity for all to, see which
recruits will be able to"work their
way into the lineup and also just
which returnees took their soccer
seriously over the pastsummer.

The Panthers will be playing
without the services of three starters
from, last year’s squad. Two
fullbacks will not be back in the
lineup. Tom Liebenguth, Pitt’s
sweeperback, graduated and Jerry
Tomasetti, an outside back,chose

Also, missing from the front line

. Although he had only five goals last

year, Tissue was the Panther high
scorer. Tissue, a graduate,‘ is now,
spending a year in England training
with an English football club. -

I Although the Panthers will be
without the services of these three,

Bemis still believes that his squad‘ y

will be able to compensate with the
addition of some incoming
freshmen with high credentials.
Bemis expects approximately 40
people out for training camp this
year.
“We -have had a good recruiting
year this season and,'I expect to see
about 40 to 45 players out there on
‘the opening day of camp,” said
Bemis. “We have a number of
freshmen to add to an already
young team from last year.”
Coming in for the Panthers and
to fill Liebenguth’s spot will be a

dian Don Bowen. Bowen was a Pro-

Locally, Bemis has received the ser-

local Under—l9 select team. Also, a
younger brother of Tissue will hope
to follow in his brother’s footsteps.
Dave, also a winger, will be making
the trip to Pitt.

Bemis hopes, to build his

backfield around the two remaining '

full backs--Jim Hackworth and
Tom Kunkel. Both are big, bruising
backs who contributed a great deal

.to Pitt’s defense last year. In the

nets will no doubt be junior Scott

Hamper Pitt Gvmncists

By JEFF DUROSKO

Pitt News Sports Writer
The 1979-80 season for the
Pantherette gymnastics team was
one of disappointment and injuries.
After a ninth place national ranking
at the end of the 1978-79‘ season,

hopes were high for another top-10 .

finish,7 but midway through the
season, the women ran into trouble.
One of the biggest matches of the
season was a rare (first time ‘in 25
years) Field House double dual
match with the men against.Penn\
State in January. Although both
Pitt {quads were defeated, the
match was played to a packed house
which showed its appreciation for
the fine gymnastics they saw.
From there on in, it was strictly
down hill for the Pantherettes as
they took to the road for two mat-
ches in Michigan. Pitt defeated
Eastern Michigan,_ but lost to
Michigan State on that trip. A big
problem at those meets was the
judges scoring more on difficulty
than execution, according to coach

Ie 

of the team qualified for
tionals. /. .
“A number ‘of injuries
throughout the year hampered the
team,” ‘Goff said. “We began to
dwindle in numbers and problems
arose especially on the relay teams.

the na-

. If youlwould have one ‘girl injured

from ‘a relay team it would hurt
"three relays since the girls double up
on the relays.” _

The lack of a cross countryiteam
last fall was also labeled as a pro-
blem to last season’s long distance
competitions. ’

“Since we weren’t able to have a
cross country team last year it really
hurt the long distance runners,”

Goff said. “They needed that run- .

ning in the fall as a way to work out
before the season started. Now
with the comeback of a cross coun-
try team thisfall, I think that an im-
provement_will be seen in the long
distances.” ' I

Donna Sanft. In .other words, ‘not
because Pitt .gymnasts had more
form breaks in their routines, but
because the judges felt they didn’t
contain- enough difficult moves,
were the routines scored" lower than
those of Michigan competitors.

[The following week, the Panther-
ettes went back to the Midwest to
compete in the Windy City Invita-
tional held annually in Chicago; At
least three teams which finished
ahead of Pitt in the previous years

nationals were present and the "
Pantherettes placed sixth, despite‘

being “rattled” as Sanft said.

The first annual Pitt Invitational,
which was held in late November,
was one of the season’s_high points
as the Pantherettes took top honors
in the first time ever for that event.
Pantherette Bonnie Tressler took
first place in theall-around com-
petition, scoring a total of 34:70
points.

,The Pantherettes were hoping to
redeem themselves at Easterns in
March, but fell short and finished a
disappointing sixth and thus, didn’t
qualify’ for nationals. _One of the
problems, according to Sanft, was
that Pitt had to go during the first

round “and the judges were afraid .

to go too high because they knew
the teams _with higher seasonal
averages/would be coming . later.’ ’
Pitt scored 131.55 points.

The best performances of the
meet were turned in by_Holly Mar-
tino who was 13th in the all-around
with a score of 33.75, Roxann
Evans who was 15th with 33.25 and
Tressler who ended up 20th with
32.5. '

- “We didn’t have a great meet,”
Sanft I said following the meet.

“With the way we were performing,
we wouldn’t have been able to place
third even without the problems
with the judges.”

The highlight of Easternsiwas the
‘ performances by Martino and

Evans in the uneven bars event.
Both missed making the all-East

. team by only one-tenth of a point.

“The scores were__so low that the
audience booed enough to stop the
meet,” Sanft said. ‘

Other outstanding performers of
the season included those of injury-‘
riddled Myra Bachuchine. and
freshmen Gretchen Speich and Bab-
bie Flock. The team will be
welcoming back almost all of last

year’s members and the women will ~

be looking to make it back to na-
tionals as a team.

The men’s ‘team _concluded a win-
ning, but disappointing’ season in
March, but with no ‘regional com-

petition, as thataspect was cut from .

men’s gymnastics, sending~only the
top notch teams to nationals. The
Panthers were also plagued by in-
juries throughoutlthe season, but
still managed to post a 6-2 record. -

Reflecting on the season, coach
Frank D’Amico said, “We had a
pretty good, year but we didn’t score

as high as I had hoped. We had too-
many injuries and our-lack of depth ,

hurt us the most.”
He added that with only five men

‘competing, the range between» the

best and worst individuals’ scores

.can be as much as two-and-a-half

points. ,

“In other words,” he said, “if
our best score is a 9.0 and the worst
is a 6.5, it makes it tough to win a
meet or score the kind of totals I
know we are capable of scoring.”

the Pitt spikers finished in a seventh

Lewis called the scheduling con-

only had to fit the tournament

only team during the tournament to

T take a game from the Bruins.

On that western tour, the Pan-
experienced a
phenomenon known to only a select
few Pitt teams: sell-out crowds and
major media coverage. According
to coach Mike Hebert, at Hawaii-
Hilo, the whole town came out to
see the game, along with the Hilo
men's basketball team, equipped

with a set of bass drums. Also, the

Pitt spikers were given the kind of
media attention that the Penn State
football squad_draws when it comes
to town. ‘

Another season highlight was the

Pitt Invitational ‘which the Pan-

therettes won for the first time in its
three year existence. .The following

week, Pitt won the Cincinnati Invi- .

tational. over some strong
midwestern teams. /-

For the second year in a row, the
Pitt spikers headed to Houston for
that school's tournament and plac-
ed seventh with a 3-3 record. Team
captain Cindy Chambers was nam-
ed to- the seven-member all-touma-
ment team, a great honor according
to Hebert. 2 -

Other tournaments in which Pitt
competed include the Pitt Classic
where the Pantherettes placed se-
cond to Ohio State, the Maryland
Invitational (Pitt! placed fourth),
and the Ohio stateﬁnvitational (Pitt
was third).

In the final regular season match,

Pitt faced Penn State and suffered -

one of its most devastating defeats
of the year, 1515, 15-7, 15-4 to a
somewhat inferior Lady Lion team.

Easterns brought back winning
for Pitt as the Pantherettes downed
Rutgers in the semi-finals and a
never-say-die squad from
Georgetown in the /finals to take
their second Eastern title inlas many
years. '

“This championship is much
more gratifying than last year,”
said Hebert after the finals match.
“After Ingrid (Mueller)—one of
last year's top performers—trans-
ferred, it left a big hole and, along
with our big schedule, there was a
lot of pressure on our program to
perform.”

‘ Some people felt it was sick to get so emotionally involved with our
pens. But is it really so crazy tolove a Pilot Razor Point pen that writes with
a sharp smooth line and costs a mere 79¢? is it nuts to ﬂip over its,unique ‘
little metal collar that smartly helps to keep its point from going squish?
. If it is crazy. it's going to surprise a whole lot of people. in fact. we

understand that Pilot Razor Point even has what it takes to score extra

‘ points with football players.

By DYLAN WILLIAMS

Playgoing can be one of the most
enjoyable and entertaining ex-
periences. Unlike the movies, each
performance of a play is unique,
not ohly from company to com-
pany, but also from day to day. _A
play captivates theimagination as
well as the emotions, and the at-
mosphere of live theatre always
seems to _intensify and individualize
the presentation. Be it classical,
alternative, or strictly experimental
theater, a well-done play is a -
refreshing exercise in active com-

, munication between the audience
and actors, an experience not to‘be
found on the screen or anywhere
else. '

To share in the playgoing ex-
perience, obviously it is helpful to
have anidea of what plays are‘ be-
ing presented in the Pittsburgh area.
Here is a list of the major theaters
around the city and their produc-
tions, some of Whom are currently
ending their summer runs, while
others will be beginningla new fall
season shortly.

The Soho Repertory Theatre,
located_ on Fifth and Craft in the St.
Peters Episcopalian Church, is cur-
rently running (from August 15th to
the 30th) a play which director
James Gardner classifies as ”beyond
classification." It is entitled "Suicide
in B Flat" and was written by actor-
playwright Sam Shepard, a very
popular modern writer who many
feel produces plays that are a kind I
of ”visual poetry.-" The play is
about a couple of detectives in-
vestigating the ”murder” of a musi-

' cian who may have really commit-
ted suicide. Meanwhile, the dead
musician carries on his own play in
the balcony, adding humor, music,
and insight to the story of the
detectives. The play is a good exam-
ple of the modern poeticrealism
that the year-old Repertory enjoys
presenting. "_’I like plays that-re-
quire an actor's talent, (there are

, spme ﬁrigjnﬁscores by the pianist

in this Slay) are very theatrical, and
have a strong story line," says
Gardner. The play, which runs
about an hour and a half, is A
presented Fridays through Sundays
at 8:00. Prices are $4.00 for adults,
$2.75 for students and senior
citizens.

The Indian Wants the Bronx by

‘ Israel Horovitz is a play that the

_~.

Allegheny Repertory Theatre just

couldn't pass up. ''It was performed T

last spring at the Pitt Studio
Theatre,” said Lynn Fero, associate

._ director _of the Rep. "It didn't get a

lot of advance publicity, but it did

' quite well on word-of-mouth. Un-
fortunately, though, the play was

ending‘ its run by the time word got
aroundiand the play began selling
out." This reyival, directed by /V
Kevin Cotter, is the story of an In-
dian who is looking for his son's
house in the Bronx. He gets lost in
Manhattan and, unable to speak
English, tries to communicate with a
couple of street punks. The play is
the story of loneliness and violence;
it is dramatic with some black-com-
edy present. ’ ' -

The Allegheny Repertory Theatre
is not just a theater company. They
are a corporate center for the
talented, providing the business end
of theater for original scripts and
student projects, as well as conven-
tional plays. The Indian Wants the
Bronx runs Thursday through Sun-
day, August .21 through September
7, at 8:00. The play is at the Lion-

walk, on North'Craig Street and _ ' I

Rom-:0 AND JULIET
Directed by Stephen iWyman

I Stephen Foster Memorial Theatre

. By CHRIS RASMUSSEN

When viewed. as a whole, the Three
Rivers Shakespeare Festival's offering of
Romeo and Iuliet has some problems—-
{mainly those of interpretation. But when
dissected into its composite parts, revealing
the arduous work spent on each aspect of
the production, the play most definitely
shines. .

Romeo and Iuliet is certainlyla tragedy.
Nearly everyone knows the story of the
"star-crossed” lovers from feudingxfamilies,
who by their fateful deaths—suicides—-the
two households are brought together in

‘peace. Yet the fundamental crux of the tale
revolves around romance of the adolescent
irk: we learn of the children's expression of
love, the attempts to deal with their familial
conflicts, "and their eventual decision to
sacrifice themselves for the sake of love, It
is an infernally sad story, breeding on our
emotions and spawning (somehow) hope,
even though we realize that our aspirations

‘ will be fruitless. '

We feel extreme compassion for the
characters of Romeo and Juliet.‘ Recognized

By A.W-W

Shakespeare came to Pittsburgh

‘mesmerized. ' And this is how the stageplayi

succeeds. _ _

Unfortunately, it is also how the produc-
tion fails, for there is too little emphasis on
the musings of the youngsters: their
movements and gestures too ‘dramatic at
times, the development of their characters
precluding the development of their emo-
tions. For Shakespeare's is a play about
love. -/The eventual result is that, at the final
curtain, we feel inordinately sad; however,
we do not feel fulfilled.

Aside from these criticisms, however,
much is to be said for the succeeding
building blocks of the production. The act-
ing, except for those instances listed above,
was of a very high (quality. Romeo (Jon

Hayden), as directed, was enthusiastic and C

convincing. His scenes with his friend Mer-
cutio (David Kuhns) were incredibly
humorous and quitefwell-staged. Asluliet,
Belinda Casas looked and acted like the
epitome of innocence. Hers was also a very
good performance; it is a shame that her

soliloquies and interludes of romance with
Romeo were not emphasized in the direc-
tion. '

Also worthy of note was Jodi Lynne Mc-
Clintoc_k’s portrayal of\Iuliet’s nurse. Her
lines were delivered with_fine, convinding
timing and aplomb. Friar Laurence (David

.Crawford) was less impressive, however.

His stage mannerisms and loud diction
tainted his performance with overacting.
He just sounded too bold and too dramatic
for his character. '

Perhaps the most professional touch to
Romeo and Iuliet was the superb staging of
the swordfighting scenes by Alex Coleman.
The combat was confident and very lively.

To have missed Romeo and Iuliet is to
have missed a real treat. It is non-stop,
engrossing theatrical entertainment which is
among the most" elaborate to be found in
the Pittsburgh area. This is the premiere
season for the Three Rivers Shakespeare
Festival. Let's hope it continues well into
the future.

1' ' .Soho’s ‘Suicide’  Mysterious, Must See Success

SUICIDE IN B FLAT
Directed by Iames Gardner
Written by Sam Shepard
Soho Repertory Theater-

By THOM PALMER

"One story's as good as another. It's
. all in the way you tell it." ' \
—Sam Shepard

Or who you have telling it for you. Ever
hear of losing something in the-translation?
Maybe in the ‘cast of Suicide in B Flat this is
true, maybe not. Perception of the play, as
well as the enactment of it, has a lotto do
with its success. Shepard's play is a miasma
of multi-level mystery that doesn't forsake
its comic aspirations for_its dramatic ones;

Suicide is’ about the suicide, or murder

(or simulation of both) of an improvising .

’ imusician, and the two detectives who try to
wade through the case's discord. What is
more disquieting than the play’s onset of

ambiguity constituted by the musing detec-
tives Pablo ‘(Bill McKendree) and Louis

‘(Doug Farrell) is the actors themselves.

Their actions seem to be more a conflagra- -

tion of assemblage rather than structured
stage—play, until Lou‘is -breaks into the first
”piece," a bluesy monologue run parallel

with the play’s original score (courtesy of _

Lisa Polanskyand G. Lamont Arnold). _

The _”pieces" are the core of the play,
dialogues or monologues juxtaposed with
jazz. Extemporized ideas and impromptu
lyrics, ,_they hint at the heart of.Shepard’s
play, tapping to the beat and tone of Polan-
sky's piano. \ ’ ’

The play picks up with the introduction
of each new character: Petrone (G. Lamont
Arnold) saxophonist and friend of the vic-

tim, and Laureen (Laurie Kapner) a bass-
‘fiddle player. Their presence is more of a

befuddlement to the detectives rather than a
help, but for the time being, Arnold and
Kapner steal the scenes. Bothperformances
are phlegmatic and airy, with a strong sense

' Roam Mossy AND Rrcrmrm WADDINGHAM IN ‘SUICIDE IN B FLAT’

Extemporized ideas and impromptu lyrics-" _. .

of confidence in themselves_and in their au-
dience. They give the play the bite it needs
to grab its audience from the start. ‘S

Then we get to meet the victim Niles
(Richard Waddingham) and his accomplice
Paulette (Robin Mosby). With their induc-
tion, the story suddenly reveals itself to be a
vault of unanswered questions and ideas.
Somebody died, that we can tell from the
police outline on the floor, but now we
don't know who. Through ritual and
psychic displacement, Niles and Paulette go’
about trying. to eliminate the detectives.
Are the police too close to the truth? Why
did Niles falsify his death? Did Niles falsify
his death? _

Shepard lets on begrudgingly, and uni-

’ ' quely. As far as facts go, the play is ‘one
‘paroxysm after another.

Shepard has us
turning every which way. But most ad-
mirably, he keeps us listening.

In all honesty, it is a work hard to cri-
tique without some measure of ambiguity.
What is concrete, for the most part, is
Soho’s performance. Waddingham is

flawless as Niles; his actions range from

mockery to macabre, nourishing his
character into tangibility. But the timing
with the music is the play’s key, and the
company pulls it off very well. They give
Shepard's prosy speeches the precision they
‘need to bring it off. Every word, every in-
ference has a purpose, and they treat it as
such. Despite _a watery and histrionic
beginning, the play picks up and holds itself
steady all the way through. i L T
Suicide is a curio of images and
metaphors, time~periods and values, sug-
gestions and demands. It elevates theatre
conscientiousness for both actor and au-
dience, and discipline on the part of both
make Suicide in B Flat something to see. '

PLAY NO. 1'

I Written by Charles Peters

Directed by Ramona Dowiak I

I The opening work was a short, cute com-
edy about an unmotivated youngster, Rich
(Dan Love), who learns, oddly enough, ofa

contest whereby plays are solicited. Rich is .

a writer whose creative abilities are blocked
by only two things: the television and his

parents. What he watches on the tube he is .

in control of, switching stations as his
whims steer him, but his parents, he finds,
are not as easy to overcome—at least in-

itially. Warned by his father (Edwin Gur) _

to find a job, or else face physical harm,

and pushed by his‘ mother (Frances »

Malarkey) to ”just sit down and 'write,"
Rich becomes entangled in his imagination.

During their conversations’, Mom drums‘
up different genres of playwrighting:

romance, comedy, and then mystery; Rich .

gives 4 each idea a try, but in an unusual
way: he faces the\audience, and, onstage,
his parents act out his imaginedscenes. He
pictures them as lovers in/an over-acted
romantic interlude, then as W.C. Fields and
Mae West in a bawdy vignette, but then
dismisses both of these notions as being un-
worthy of his writing of them. In the final
vignette, however, his parents-as Sherlock
Holmes and Dr. Watson, he concocts a-

humorous spin-off of a mystery, in which"

Dr. Watson's undreamed-of love affair with
a woman is essential to the plot. This Rich-
envisions as having great potential, and the
play ends as his father's Holmes character

leans toward him, pipe in hand,_ and says,"

"Well, then, write it!"

**-****.**i'*
Written by Linda Hudak
Directed by Christopher Rawson/

‘In this, the most intricately constructed
of the three plays, Linda Hudak" shows

great promise as a_ playwright. The story -

occurs in ‘the small apartment of an old
woman, whose world of fantasy, past and
present, combine‘ with reality to give a

sculpture of pathos. For it "is the audience's I

musings about her possible senility in con-
trast to her almost painfully emotional"

 ﬂashbacks, that keeps the drama alive. The
woman, May Uller (Nann Mogg), was the '

chief caretaker of her widower brother's‘
two boys for a very long time. They had
abused her under the a premise that she

wasn't really their mother, and, through.)
her attachment to them, she became ,
' apart emotionally when one boy ignored ‘

Petrov's Repertoire Spans Classics Through Iazz i y   .
‘ American Dance Ensemble Promises Spicy80-81 Season

By CANDICE KOMAR ‘

The American Dance_Ensemble is ready to begin its fourth adventurous season
since its inception in 1977. The company was founded by Nicolas Petrov for the
purpose of developing and showcasing talent in the performing arts in Western
Pennsylvania. The dancers are mainly students from Point Park College with
guest artistsand principals brought in from_professional companies. The ensem-
ble doésnft limit itself {to classical ballet, but includes many jazz productions in its
season's repertoire. This is the second company Petrov has engendered in Pitts-i
burgh. Before ADE, he ’ was founder and director of the Pittsburgh Ballet _

. Theatre, of which he was artistic director. _ I

The first production, scheduled from October 16 to 19, will consist of two pro- [ .

‘ grams. Program A offers a classical favorite, Graduation Ball, which is a story,
about a party at a fashionable girls’ academy that hosts the neighboring military
"school. The music is by Lichine. Also featured is the humorous Olympic Fever,
with music by Myerbeer from Sir Frederick Ashton's ballet Les Patineurs. West
Side Story, a popular work from last season. will also be repeated. This contains
the dance. numbers from the Broadway hit cleverly staged and excitingly re-

. choreographed.‘ Program B of the October performances features Iopliniana,
with music by Scott Joplin, Soiree Musicale, _a comedy by Benjamin Britten, Pic-
ture on the Wall, with music by Jose Serebrier, and Oh Happy Day,
choreographedlby Douglas Bentz. ‘ -

The December production has a two-week run of the seasonal favorite, the
Nutcracker. This year, matinee performances have been added to give more peo-
ple a chance to enjoy the most popular ballet of all. _

On February 19 to 22 will be a special event—Stravinsl<y's Rite of Spring. This
ballet delves into the mysterious pagan rituals of pre-historic Russia justgbefore _ 
spring. It was first staged in 1912 to shocked audiences. It has since been refined . . .not limiting itselfto just classical ballet. ‘ ‘ Kama, photo

and effort to come back from an injury.

James Loses Touch With Her Readers In ‘Innocent Blood’

By THOM PALMER

What Innocent Blood lacks is a lower
level of plot and importance that the reader
can descend to at times, through the course
of the novel. English mystery writer P.D.
James has constructed an interesting talent
the painful unearthing of the past and the
clandestine harboring of revenge.

Phillipa Palfrey sets out on her eigh-
teenth birthday to find out about her
natural parents, much to the discourage-
ment of her adoptive ones. James goes to
great lengths to develop the recalcitrant
Phillipa. Or so it seems. Upon the revela-
tion that Phillipa's father was a rapist and

mother, a murderess, the novel breaks into
a different story‘.

One of the most exciting parts of the
book is the slow unfolding of her natural

_ parents’ past. We are told early on of their

rape and murder of a young girl, but we are
teased through with just tricklings of infor-
mation. The father of the young victim is
introduced, and his part slowly evolves into
that of a man carrying a ten year vendetta
against his daughter's murderers. The story
from this point concentrates on Phillipa's
contact with her soon—t’o-be-paroled
mother, (her father is dead by her eigh-
teenth birthday) and a ten-year
premeditated murder.

James’ problem lies in her narrative
priorities. The development of each
character—her adoptive mother and father,
her natural mother, the young victim, her
parents, the private detective they
employ—all are delved into as if they are
the forefront of importance. This detracts
from the _novel's flow, as well as making
some passages almost cumbersome. It is
not her language that is insufficient; just the
opposite. James shows a highly literate,
phlegmatic British style. It has a clarity of
insightful narrative without being overly
economical. But the same holds true for her
characters and their intentions. It seems
difficult at times to decide whose story it
really is. It starts with Phillipa and ends

with her, so one is inclined to lean in her
direction. The beginning and the ending of
the novel elicit this feeling. But the parts in-
between seem to throw this idea into a sub-
tle havoc, and weare left not knowing who
or what to concentrate on, and begin to
hope that James doesn't belabor us any
longer than is necessary. ' '

It is a captivating story idea, with all
the possibilities of a novel that is impossible
to put down. It is a pleasure to read
something with the strength of language
that is so rare these days. But the detailed

'st_ructure‘of development seems to con-

tribute to the paucity of it; James goals
seem to work in reverse.

A Touch Of The Renaissance Glitters OnPittCampus

' By NANCY BROWN

Pitt is famous for its tech-
nology—its medical and engineering
schools, its computer centers-—but
you don't hear about its crown
jewel. This gem nestles on the edge
of campus, at the entrance to
Schenley Park. It is ﬂanked by
massive bodyguards, the Hillman
and Carnegie Libraries, that seem to
protect it from the garish _
worldliness of the rest of the univer-
sity. This jewel is the Henry Clay
Frick Fine Arts Building. The
building evokes the most civilized

aspects of the Florentine Renais-

sance, and the visitor to the
building is suddenly aware of the
refinements of his own humanness.
The heart of the building is the
cloister. Like the closed garden of a
monastery it lets in unsullied
nature: sunshine, trees, grass and
butterflies, but excludes the mun-
dane parts of daily life. However,
the twentieth century has made a
marvelous improvement on the fif-
teenth century idea by enclosing the
arcade with glass. In winter you
enjoy the peculiar sensation of being
warm while standing in a garden as
a gentle snowfall whitens the center
of the cloister. When spring comes,

Musical ’Xanadu’

XANADU

Directed by Robert Greenwald
Writtenlby Richard Christian Danus and
Mark Reid Rubel ~

By THOM PALMER

Xanadu tries to immediately grab its au-
dience by giving each scene a transfusion of
unctuous splendor, starting with the very
first of Danny McGuire (Gene Kelley) sit-
ting on a rocky beach, playing his clarinet
with Pan-like abandon. Mythology was
never so chocolate-coated.

The story (but don't quote me) involves a
struggling young artist's (Michael Beck)
need to pursue his own form of expression,
and an ex-big band musician (Kelly) who
wants to feel the excitement of the old days.

They chug miraculously toward‘ their goal
due to their magical alliance that they
achieve with the help of the heavenly muse,
Kira (Olivia Newton-John). Unfortunately,
even the chatoyant and annoying
backlighting can't make Miss Newton-John
heavenly. As an actress, she just can't cut
it. Her dancing is something that neither-
editing nor Arthur Murray can cure, and
when writers Danus and Rubel give her a
scene hoofing it next to Kelly (whose face
and feet are as limber as ever), Olivia
should just shuffle out of frame and let the
master try and give the film some value.

Xanadu is ‘a suicide film: the type that
demands you eat popcorn, and then throws
scenes at you that are so facetious in their
seriousness that you choke. Still, it's hard
to pull the scalpel across the throat of this
film. If anything deserves credit, it's the
fact that Director Greenwald did try a new
approach to the film musical. What might
have hurt him was the hindsight he paid to
the old~time ones. The law of safety inijthe
repetition of past success doesn't hold here.
There is a statute of limitation in films of
this kind of at least 20 or 30 years. What
Kelly and other film musical masters of the
past have done are locked forever in the ar-

OLIVIA DURING A METAMORPHOSIS; Gem-: KEEPING rr rnssn

. . .violating the statute of film_limitations

chives. Greenwald should not haveitried to
coax them back, even to the slight degree of
Xanadu. ‘

But he has the right idea. He tries to pool
the effects of new technology and create a
modern musical. What—Greenwald lacks,

however, is the constant that all films,
musical or otherwise, must have, and that
is good material, good timing, and a good
cast. Only one-half of his saleable actors are

worthy, and that is Kelly. But the rest of V

the picture has to struggle to keep itself
mediocre. Much of the dancing broadcasts

Does Not Do Much Of Anything Well 3

its simplicity rather than conceal it, and
even the costumes seem flawed and shoddy.

Drawing conclusions from Xanadu, it
would seem the modern musical still has a
distance to travel to become a standout.
Throw this one out and start again.

‘My Bodyguard’ A Rare Treat- A Good Summer Film

By WALTER WATSON

My Bodyguard may be one of this sum-
mer's sleeper movies. Its main character is a.
rich kid named Clifford Peache (Chris
Makepeace). Cliff has problems at a new
high school when hoodlums threaten his life
unless he agrees to pay a dollar a day’in
protection money. Protection from A the

protectors. Cliff decides to seek out an
Aalternativeto paying the extortion fee that a
good number of students are already pay-

‘ing to "Big M” (played by Matt Dillon). ah

Peache attempts to acquire the services of
the school's "local mass murderer," Ricky
Linderman (newcomer Adam Baldwin).
Although the original intention was to wipe
out the * threat of the punks from terroriz-
ing any more students, Cliff wants to be
Linderman's friend, and works hard at
establishing that friendship.
Problem-solving, making new, friends,

. . .taking initiativepand facing up to responsibility.  It -

and overcoming fears are the points of
observation made in My Bodyguard. It’s,a
funny film with good acting. It deals with
the real problems of growing up and
fighting one's own battles. Director Tony '
Bill gives adequate attention to theskyline
and- environment of Chicago to show the ci-
ty's character and complement the realism
of the movie's gentle giant, rich kid, and
punks.

My Bodyguard will be compared to last ‘

year's award-winning Breaking Away for
its tendency to show a teenager making
decisions for himself, learning to stand on
his own two feet, fighting for what he
thinks is right. This basic-values-and-

_ respect-for-others sentiment is not preach-

ed, but carefully fed into the cute story of
My Bodyguard. And like Breaking Away!
it is a "discovery” film, where the main

_ characters take‘initiative and face up to

responsibility.

Martin Mull puts in a brief appearance as
Cliff's father, a busy manager at Chicago's
Ambassador East Hotel. His character is
very consistent with the reasons for Cliff's
initiative-taking. The spry Ruth Gordon
play Cliff's mischievous, fun-loving grand-
mother who makes minor disturbances
with the guests at the hotel. John

‘Houseman gets into the act as a stuffy head

of the Ambassador chain, "who loosens up
after a few drinks with Miss Gordon.
Watch for the rib-tickling Craig Richard
Nelson, who, at four-foot—seven, is the high
school's local shrimp afraid of his own
shadow. My Bodyguard left this viewer

with a good feeling about life in these ~

United States. And after all, isn’t,it time for
a few sleepers that don't put you to sleep?

into an eye-healing world of natural

Bates’ Sgraffito Displays Complex Compelling Control

RECENT SGRAFFITO WORKS
Wayne L. Bates
Clay Place

By JILL PEARLMAN

If you told Wayne Bates that you weren't
familiar with sgraffito, he's say that you
were, but you "just didn't know it. In his
personal, soft—spoken manner, he'd explain
that every culture has used the-process of

- _ carving a design_vth€i;p__1‘;‘ghN layers of colored.
Wéfay to‘ exp:o‘s‘é‘”“7:th‘e"I'plain clay beneath.

Greeks, Persians, Italians and American In-
dians have all ornamented their pottery
with a incised line; now Bates is trying it his
own way. A

   

Ceramics usually rely on- a certain ran-~

domness; pots are rarely round, glazes drip
and fuse in the kiln, oxidation changes them
in unpredictable ways. Bates has tamed the
randomness and with a great deal of control
is experimenting with different thematic,
aesthetic and cultural concepts. One
notices inspiration from the American In-
dians: simple linear designs such as sun-
burst spirals, rising suns, colors of a desert
sunset such as mauve, rose, midnight blue
and cactus green. A large vase resembles an
Egyptian lotus with its softly swelling ribb-
ed shoot. Stylized designs of plants, linear
pattern and high glosses curtsy to Art Deco.

Bates’ technique is unusual and reveals

his concerns. After a piece is -thrown and

 dry, he sprays narrow bands of thin, dif-

ferent colored clay on it. The bands radiate

as they subtly change from black to deep”

blue, purple: to yellow. Bates looks‘ for

- gradations as imperceptible as possible to.

accentuate the roundness of the plate, bowl
or vase. * -

When the colored slips, as they are call-
ed, have dried, the artist begins to carve his
design, revealing the natural cream tone of

H the plain clay. In contrast to thelooseness

and flow of the colors, the patterns are

. geometric and are carved in a sharp even

line. Parallel lines converge, yield or
change directions, squares tip in a circle,

lines radiate from a single point and extend
beyond the .confines of the circular color.

The designs ' ‘are’ "simple and intricately 
. workedout, alwaysdefying symmetry with s
an unexpected patch of white or’ an unruly I’
group of lines. The complexity and amount A

of white is Bates’ other challenge.

Bates is a fine craftsman and artist. He
taught at the Philadelphia College of Art

‘ for many years and recently moved to‘ Ken-

tucky to open his Blood River Studio. His

experience is apparent—so]rie of hispieces Q

too_smooth.. Yet Bates is gutsy and im-
aginative, His work shows a complexity
and concern that makes him unique.

to one of the most magnificent ballets of this century. Nicolas Petrov will be
choreographing it for the ensemble this season as he did for the Pittsburgh Ballet
Theatre in the early 1970’ s. Another popular Bentz work, Livin’ in the City, will
be repeated this season, as well as Gopek, a Ukranian folk dance. Another
highlight of this program will be the presentation of Bolero, which will be revive
by the monumental American choreographer Ruth Page. *

The final program in April (9-12) will contain a new composition from the Rod
McKuen series last year and a .salute to Benny Goodman titled Let's Swing. Also
included will be the classical ballet Raymonda Variations, consisting of nine
dances for corps, soloists, and principals from the full-length ballet Raymonda.
There is no story; there is nothing to do with the plot of the original, yet Alex-
ander Glazunov’s score seems to be enough to carry the plot of the dances. "

Co-artistic directors of the company are Kenneth Johnson and ‘Douglas Bentz.

The featured principals this season are Douglas Bentz and Jordeen Ivanov. A
special addition to the principal list is the former Bolshoi soloist Mikhail
Messerer. recently defec‘tml”fmm the U.S.S.P ’\‘u-sserer is the son of the l30l5l‘.ni's
Primae Ballerina Sulasmith Messerer. ' Some of his roles have been the
Prince in Sleeping Beauty,‘ opposite Galina Panov, and the leading roles
in Giselle, Swan Lake, Le Bayadere, and Nutcracker. He has partnered
many of the Bolshoi's famous stars, including Alonso, Golikova, Plitset-
skaya, and Riabinkina. He was awarded first prize in the National Com-
petition ‘of Contemporary Choreographers in\Moscow and the Intema—
tional Competition at Varna. He will be partnering Ivanov for ADE and
acting as guest teacher and choreographer for the dance ‘department at
the college. A Hungarian soloist, Jano Emil Franyo, will also be a new
and bright addition to the company's growing list of notable dancers.
Guest artists will be Alexander Filipov, Robert Munoz-Blum, Peter

Interview

Fnxomr, Aueusr 29,"-1'980—PAG'E 11

By JEFF LEI~IMAi\

Itarrived at WTAE a half-hour early for my in-

terview with disc jockey Jim Quinn.
would certainly give plenty of time to che_ck
out the radio station scene, and possibly
discover a Loni Anderson look-alike. Looking
out-the window by which I say, I saw that the
station's helicopter was landing in that big
circle painted on the parking lot. I would
soon know whether "it was a mistake parking
my car near that circle.
’ The line of questioning which I would pur-
sue with Quinn dealt with the music scene in
the '60s Twenty minutes into our lunch, I
realized that he" wasn't nearly as excited
about talking about Martha and the
Vandellas, Paul and Paula, Clark Race, Jimi
Hendrix, and Linda Ronstadt (when she was
a part of the Stone Ponies) as I was.

But Quinn did prove to be enthusiastic
about stating his views on such diverse topics
as advertising (and its abuses), nutrition ,(or
the lack of it), the Depression (the reason why
there are ‘so many overweight Americans),
Iran ("ruled by a 14th century mind"), the

‘automobile ("a rolling place to fool around"),
and the state of the western world ("western
man is insane"). I

» I think that you'll find that Jim Quinn is
another reason to believe that how a person

earns his living may give little insight into how » '

he thinks and what he thinks is important. In-
deed, monitoring radio waves from distant
regions of the universe is what Jim Quinn con-
siders one of the ultimate tum-ons.

SHOWCASE:‘Were you aware that your KQV

or reject anything that they're doing out there.
I just want to know what it is so I can relate to

well have a jukebox.

school at the time that makes me feel "that
way?

-‘JQ: It was an extra hot period, no doubt

about that. There was a great deal of
change in consciousness. I think our country
went through 'a "real adolescence from 1940

beginning to sense the way the world is work-

‘ ing. For the most part, it was that level of col-
) lege person who led a lot of that change.

SHOWCASE: It is interesting that you take this

- ‘back to the '40s. .
 If you want to take it back, it began after J"
V the Depression.

It put emphasis on material
wealth that this country’ had never quite
understood. I'm sure there are a lot of fat
people in this" country who are victims of

-‘parents who lived through the Depression
and . wanted to make sure that (‘their kids’

stomachs were always full.

We give our kids way too much! The idea
that "I'm going to give my kid what I didn't
have" is probably the most socially destruc-
tive idea._ My parents and your parents have
given rise ‘to generations of children for
whom the mall and television is the same as

the sun coming up in the morning. What they '

didn't realize is that if the plug is pulled on
this, if there's a nuclear war, or an ice age,’ or
any major change, 95 percent of the people
alive today will be eliminated! 4
SHOWCASE: You've__\touched upon ‘the
system'—now how about the people’? A

JQ: There's_ something about western man
that is nuts! James Burke's television series
Connections made note that the Chinese
had‘ gunpowder for, I think, 700 or 900 years
before. the westem- world got a hold of it. The
Chinese used it for religious purposes and
fun, and they never once killed anyone with
it. Westerners got a hold of it, and the first
thing they did was pack it into an

I unhollowed-out church bell, put a ball in

there, and blow someone's wall down! r r
SHOWCASE: What are your feelings about

. food advertisements aimed at our children?

JQ: I think it's very unfair. The fast food chains

_ peddle white bread which is full of sugar and

has virtually no nutrients. They peddle
cookies, fried white pastry pies, and’ sugared
soft drinks (many of them containing caf-

feine, a terrible irritant to the nervous system),
- with all those little cartoon characters. I

believe_- that many diseases are closely

related with the same eating patterns that"

these same establishments manage to instill
in young children before they have the in-
tellectual capability to make a wise choice.

SHOWCASE: Advertising's inherent message
appears to be: "Buy the proper products and
you, too, can have an exciting lifestyle and
personality." ” I
JQ: Advertising is still a left-over American
dream from the post-war years. It's— the belief
that ,we can all have a ridiculously high stan-
dard of living, and that we can all be mar-
ried to a beautiful person. Media has seen to
it that there's a little bit of L.A. in all of us.
SHOWCASE: Do you ever get the feeling that
womenjwho ‘have a huge wardrobe_/and al-
ways wear makeup are trying to conceal
something?

QC.‘-‘_
JQ: Makeup and clothes are an effect.
Hollywood was the first real proliferation of
-- mass societal attitudes.
that many people have been exposed to
(other than family and friends) are the soap
operas and movies. So they grew up thinking
that this is the proper way to respond, rather
than sitting down with his or her mate and

asking, "What's going on here?" With
Hollywood,» we began to define. what is
beautiful and what isn't. Consequently,

makeup came along. I hate to sound so
pessimistic, but again, it's another bad fruit
from a basically bad tree.

SHOWCASE: Do you think that it will always be
mildly traumatic for the teenage boy to walk
over to the teenage girl and ask her to dance?
dance? , ‘ .
JQ: I went to a Catholicschool where the girls

on the other. And then they threw us together
at 17 and said, "Here, relate!" Relate? We
didn't ever know what "relate" meant! We
looked at the girls as some sort of strange
animal, and they looked at us as some sort of
strange animal. When the guy and girl found
out there was an animal attraction between
them, they immediately assumed that that
was love and got married.

SHOWCASE: Next I:O]§lC: America's love affair
with the automobile. V

JQ: Before cars, you didn't take a girl out. You
got permission to come -see her from her

‘ parents, and you went to her house and sat

in the parlor and talked and played parlor
games. You didn't ‘take her out anywhere

 Entertainment   

 

 

   

* TheSta

By SCOTT MOWRY

So you wanna dance and listen to
some live music in the Steel
: , City—where do yougo?

Well, of course that depends on
what you want to do, who you
want to see and how much you
want to spend. Pittsburgh does
have the facilities to accomodate
most any taste and preference in
music, though admittedly live music
venues are limited. '

Like any other big metropolis in
America with lots of city and subur-
ban music fans, Pittsburgh's bars
and clubs have had their share of a
rich, colorful and slightly shady
history. a . — '

Phase III, in Swissvale, for in-

\ stance, was once Pittsburgh's
underground incubator of punk
before it turned to livesex shows in
the summer of '79. It eventually

‘became victim of an arson’s attack
and was gutted by a fire in
September of last year. _

During its heyday, Phase III not
only was about the only place to
find local new wave in the city but‘
also to‘ see bands likeThe Police,
The Dead Boys and John Cale, on
the same stage. ~
I Phase III and its audiences were a
continual sore spot with its '
Swissvale neighbors and the place
was doomed to a short but sweet ex-
istence. 4

Antoninds in Oakland, like
Phase III, was not very popular
amongst its South Craig Street
‘neighbors, At one time or another
Antonino's hosted, the Ramones,
the Talking Heads, Eddie and the
Hot Rods and Eddie Money among
others, before turning strictly to
more mellow acts.

Finally, Monroeville’s Parkway
Tavern was forced to ban rock ’n'
roll entirely from its stage when
rowdy fans caused one too many
equally rowdy disturbances. The

. Parkway Tavern now brings in
nothing more rambunctious than an
original country band. ‘

But let's not dwell ‘on what has
been lost, here's what's left to
choose from: , V

At this point in time, the club
scene in Pittsburgh is dominated by
a contingency of four major clubs:
The Decade" in south Oakland, '

ty in Swissvale and Stage One in
Monroeville. These are the clubs
capable of handling the biggest .
bands and the largest audiences.
The Decade on 223 Atwood

Street is the home of Pittsburgh's

premiere ”showcase" of current, up
and coming rock ‘n’ roll. It regular-
ly hosts new young bands from
around the world and also serves as
home base for the Iron City
Houserockers. .

As perhaps the smallest of the
,”big four,” The Decade has an au-
dience capacity of about 250-300.
Its cavern-like atmosphere and in-
timate surroundings alwaysseem to
work to the best advantage of a hot
band on stage and The Decade has
featured a number of exciting small
rock shows. The Ramones, Joe
Jackson,’ Robert Fripp and Steve
Forbert are just a few of the 35 in-
ternational bands that have ap-
peared on The Decade stage within
-the past year and a half. Usually,

I admission prices are kept under $5

but get there early.

Mancini’s on 826 Island Avenue is
perhaps Pittsburgh's largest seating
capacity club. It's motif of black
lights and flourescent colors are .
ibackdated, yet no one" seems to
mind. . Recently, Mancini’s stage
was rebuilt and the club is now
ideal for the bigger shows it has

~ begun to produce. Rick Derringer, ,

the Joe Perry Project and Pat

' Benatar have already played Man-

cini’s. The Pretenders are due on
September 6. Although admission
prices are higher than The Decade's,
Mancini’s is usually packed for the
big‘ shows, so arrive early.

Fat City on Waverly Street is’
another Pittsburgh club that
regularly mixes out of town acts
with locals. Although it resembles
a VFW fire hallin_a way, Fat C/ity
nonetheless is an open, "expansive
club with a panoramic‘ view of its
large stage. Often, it brings in long
established blues acts like Muddy
_Waters and new bluesmen like the

\ Fabulous Thunderbirdsyvho ap-

peared last July. The Silencers, Pitts
burgh's latest recording act, more
or less have claimed Fat City as
home and gig there quite often.
Stage One's (1806 Route 286,

A couple of second generation
clubs that opened up this past year
have provided stages and audiences
for Pittsburgh's punk and new wave
bands.

The Electric, Banana on Bigelow
Blvd. in north Oakland regularly
opens its doors for newly formed
groups. The Banana is the perfect
start. for local bands looking to

- launch a- city-wide career.

Le Cyrk on Fourth and Wood,
Downtown, (right off Market
Square), is another new club that
has encouraged newer and more
adventurous music and special
events. Le Cyrk is ‘extremely small" ‘ T‘
yet its atmosphere is lively and col- ,
orful. Seating is minimal but danc-
ing ismaximal. '
 Unfortunately, Le Cyrk is doom-
ed to the fate of the wrecking ball
when the new PPG Glass Tower is
constructed» this fall. Rumor has it-

. that the PPG building will contain a
similar rock ‘n’ roll club inside.
Regardless, Le Cyrk will be ‘missed.

te or ThePittsburgh Clubs

The Portfolio, located on South

Craig Street in Oakland is a small - _

' club that offers what one might
consider "off-beat" entertainment.
Besides a variety of musical acts
that range from folk to easy rock to
jazz, The Portfolio offers Comedy
Night. Every Tuesday evening,

"local stand-up comics get a chance
to display their range and humor to
a very vocal and‘ receptive audien e.

x No one in the audience is safe on

' Comedy Night at The Portfolio, but
‘as an alternative to the club music
scene, it might be the place one
should try. -

Jazz clubs in Pittsburgh are
numerous and everywhere to be
found. Pittsburgh is a hotbed for
American jazz and a jazz enthusiast
can choose from over 20 clubs in
the area. a

' However, now that the Encore II,
Downtown is closing, jazz in Pitts
burgh won't be the same without

‘it. The Encore II consistently pro-
vided top notch artists, dining and

entertainment. It will be very sore- '

ly missed.

But still there are plenty of quali-
ty jazz clubs to choose from,
especially in the east section of
town. The Crescendo Lounge on
508 Melwood Avenue in Oakland,
'the Encore I on 5505 Walnut Street
Shadyside and Wonderful Wanda’s
of Oakland, Forbes Avenue (inside
the Crossgates Inn) all are located
reasonably close to one another.

In Downtown alone‘ there are five
jazz clubs that combine dining and
music for a laid back evening of
entertainment. These include: The
Old Allegheny, 609 Penn Avenue,-
Tip Shelf, 606 Liberty Avenue; Bat-
tery Bar in the Carlton House;
-Hugo's in Chatham Center and John
Q, 59 Penn Avenue (located in
Stouffers). - ‘

Magazine. ' —

Basically, that is a quick rundown
of the current state of Pittsburgh's
clubs. Probably, not everyone’s
favorite club or bar was mentioned.

Heavy Metal Rises Again: Monster That Just Won’ t Die

 JUDAS PRIEST/SCORPIONS/ DEF. LEP-

4:’

‘<

PARD
Stanley Theatre

A July 31,1980

By MARK MONAHAN
With the increasng popularity of disco
and new wave music in the late '70’ s, heavy

.metal has been in a noticeable tailspin and

decline.

However, with a growing heavy metal
renaiss_ance currently happening in England
and throughout Europe, it was not surpris-

_ ing to see three of the up-and-coming metal ~

acts, Judas Priest, Scorpions and Def Lep-
pard, come into Pittsburgh recently and
play to a sold-out Stanley Theatre. _

And make no mistake about it, all three
bands played a brand of music many of us

. know and loved in the early '70’ s--siren-like

vocals, grinding, volume distorted guitars,
diesel-pounding bass, crazed ‘drumming,
lyrics which havetto do with doing unique

things to women tied to a’ tree, while ‘

creating an overall atmosphere about as
subtle as a shotgun shell to the stomach. -
Of course, by its rather agressive and,
macho nature, heavy metal ‘attracts a
primarily young and male audience who

know little sense of moderation to drugs
andalcohol in the gallant pursuit of being
absolutely comatose while getting the wax
blown out ot their ears. '
And this crowd wore their heavy metal

‘ L, yearnings like a badge.

When a local disc jockey came out to an-

nounce the upcoming Stanley concert line-'

up (primarily soft acts such as Hall and
Oates, James Taylor, George Benson and
Chicago) boos and debris started to fly
toward the stage and, had the above acts
been within vicinity of the hall, they would
have been burnt at the‘stake_.

Thrown first to the audience on this night '
of metal madness was the very young Def 9
Leppard (average age 19) a tight, exciting

band from Sheffield, England.

* Led by tassle-haired vocalist Joe Elliot .
and the dual lead guitars of Steve Clarke ‘

and Pete Willis, Leppard “played a half—hour
set of songs from their successful" debut
album On Through the Night and several
new songs from their upcoming one.

What clicked with this band was the ob-

vious enthusiasm and drive on all the
songs, with the single ”Ro_ck Brigade,”
"Hello, America,” "Wasted-" and the new
"Medicine Man" creating the most
response. -

._._.singlehandedly sums up what's wrong with a lot" of heavy I

metal.

As for thenext band, Scorpions, a five-
piece, - totally heavy metal band from
Hanover, Germany, seemed as if they had
been munching qualudes before they went
on."

Scorpions, in their undistinguished
40-minute set, singlehandedly sumed up

- what's wrong with a lot of live heavy metal‘

music.
Their drum rhythms were numbingly

.. slow, guitars distorted to pointless noise
. and the band ‘delivered this, looking like

scarecrows. .
Even though .they were the weakest band

if of the . night, M Sgprpions scored ' with
 "Aniinal v Magnetisrri,’-‘ .',"The‘.- Zo\o”iCand.. I‘:

"Love Drive,” more out of the aLidi’ence’s
familiarity with the songs than the strenght
of the perfomance. A _

As the headline act, Judas Priest, :(a five-
piece metal act from Birmingham, England

3 and superstars in the U.K.), had a much . .

better stage production and much more
time to strut and shout their metal wares.
And make no mistake about it, Judas
Priest is as hardcore a heavy metal act as
you'll ever see, making such founding
fathers as Steppenwolf ‘and Blue Oyster
Cult seem like choirboys in comparison.
With the entire band dressed in skintight
leather pants, metal studded wrist bands,
shirts and platform boots, Judas Priest
opened. the show amidst a shroud of smoke
and darkened lights with ‘singer Rob
Halford driving to center stage riding a
huge Harley. ‘Before the smoke had

cleared, the band stormed through ”Hell:
Bent for Leather," ”Ripper,” "Sinner” andi
'”Runnin’ Wild" before the crowd had:
caught its breath. 

One thing about Judas Priest is they hit; -

and play hard from‘ the word "go’" and

never. let up, and even with their rather
overwhelming total, heavy metal stance, 1

they are surprisingly appealing.

Singer Halford dressed from head to toe I.

in leather and studs, is an oddly intriguing
sort of character standing center—stage,
handling -the singing and introductions,
then tastefully disappearing when the -rest
of the band (K.K. Downing and Glen Tip-
ton, lead guitars; Ian Hill, bass; and Dave
Hollard, drums) enters into one of their
numerous jams. -
Priest had an excellent grasp of dynamics

"K and came off as the much seasoned profes-

sionals they are.
’ The only noticeable problem with the set

= was the inability to hear Halford’s vocals,

overwhelmed on many songs,by the in-
strumental assault. _ ,

However, to a band who has song titles
which include ”Ripper,” ."Grinder,” ”E>_<-
citer,” "Invader/’ "Steeler," "Genocide/’
”Tyrant” and "Metal Gods," the lyrics were
probably written while dumping a load in
the bog anyway.

All in all, it 'twas a good night for expos-

' . ing Pittsburgh's numerous and hardest core

heavy metal fiends to -three bands to whom
the future and ensuing popularity of heavy
metal will greatly depend in the 80's.

  Rossington -- Collins Band‘
Accepts The Challenge

Rossington Collins Band/ Sammy Hager
The Stanley Theatre ‘
August 8, 1980

By SAM "MATTHEWS

The Rossington Collins ‘Band is ‘not
Lynyrd Skynyrd. Although Skynyrd per-
sonnel is present,‘ the band. is vastly dif-
ferent. _

The difference of Rossington Collins
.depends on\m'any.» factors and lead vocalist
Dale Krantz is a major inﬂuence on their
image. Not only is she the only band
member who speaks to the audience, she at-

_ tempts to develop a rapport with the'kids.
Also, Krantz's influence has swayed lyrical-

ideas from the usual southem-fried rock
macho swaggering to more universal
themes. Her vocals evoke comparisons to
Gra'ce Slick, but there are truly no direct
analogy. She is unique. Behind Krantz is
one of the best guitar attack lines in
American rock, with Gary Rossington the
finest of the three. His playing suggests Eric
Clapton or the old Jeff Beck. In the
background, Alan Collins supplied some

very nice slide, guitar, whereas.Rossington 
assumed control of the the front of the 

4 ’__',.The iinterplayﬂbetw/een the two -was

e  own,    

‘ The Rossington Collins Band is. in the »
rare position of headlining a tour with only.

one album out. They played their entire
first album. Highlights of the ten-song set
were "Prime Time,” "
Good Man," and_ their single, "Don't

Misiinderstand Me." Also two unrecorded '0
new numbers were done. For the encore, J A

memories of Lynyrd Skynyrd were resur-
rected. A much-requested, ten-minute-plus

1 version of "Free Bird" was done, dedicated

to thelmemory. of Ronnie Van Zandt. It
was very" tastefully performed with no

vocals. "Free Bird" was a magical moment

and the evening's peak. _

_' Opening band Sammy “Hagar was up I

against a rough audience. Even though he
played an hour of pulsating, mainstream
hard rock,‘ the majority of the sell-out
crowd wasn't into it. His performance was
geared to get the audience off its feet and,
except for a handful up front, Sammy
Hager struck out. Too bad the audience
wasn't"more open-minded, for Hager was
an excellentopening act.

Granted, Rossington Collins sold out the '

Stanley on the reflected glory of the Lynyrd
Skynyrd name. Howyevexz, with perfor-
mances -like this, the Rossington Collins

PAT BENA-TAR/NORM NARDINI AND
THE EAST SIDE TIGERS

Mancini's“ ’

July 29, 1980

By SCOTT MOWRY '

So "here was Pat Benatar. The new sex
symbol__ of American rock. The heir ap-
parent to the Debbie Harry/ wet dream
throne. The tough but slightly vunerable
chick who says she'll just as soon kick your
ass as turn you on.

Hmmmmmph! Well, I wasn't impressed.

Benatar made her second appearance in
Pittsburgh and performed in the second
local club, having last played the Decade in
early November.

But this time Pat Benatar wasn't the same
unheard—of commodity, but a real star,
with her debut album _now platinum, three
hit singles and a brand new record already
on ‘the charts. ~ .

Too bad she could’t live up to all that.
Her show at Mancini's was simply boring.

-Basically, Benatar was lifeless on stage.
Yeah, she looks nice but she also acted like
she really didn't know what to do with
herself.‘Her on-stage act was minimal. She
either sang or didn't. That was it.

‘ When Benatar wasn't singing, her back-
up band was put in charge of entertaining

\_ the’ Mancini audience and that's when

things really got ridiculous. Guitarists Neil
Geraldo and Scott Sheets and rhythm sec-’
tion-Roger Capps and Myron Grombacher

. tried.hard to do a Led Zeppelin with enough '
spacey instrumental drivel to make you '

’ ~ ' want to scream for "Dazed and Confused.”

The Mancini" ultra-capacity audience

I .. /‘really didn't catch wind of the heavy metal

impersonation, either, and sat silently but
confused _,until the boys in the band had

. , /fini'§hed rubbing their egos.

,"' I
./ .

 

gThe new material performed from Crimes
Of Passion was indistinguishable from the
old. "Hit Me With Your Best Shot” stuck
out, but not much else.

All the other hits were dutifully paid ser--
vice, "We Live [For Love," "Heartbreaker"
and "1 Need/A"Lover" respectfully.

-"/Pat Benatar should get a grip on her
career, loosen up on stage, tell her. band to
cool /it, and sing like a woman and forget
about trying fo be every teenage boy's
ultimate fantasy.

  The Rising Voice Oflazz ~  

AI. IIARREAU/DAVID SANBORN
Iuly 27, 1980 . ‘
Stanley Theatre

~ By DAVID swans

David Sanborn opened this Sunday even-

, ing concert with some ‘extremely high
energy fusion.'\ Recognized as one of
modern music's most loved alto sax players
Sanbom, exhibited a great deal of control
over the upper register of his instrument
considered the most difficult area to master

. a genuine tone.

Sanborn's technique of playing out of the

. side of his mouth gives his tone a distinct
nasal quality, and has become his
trademark. The audience was extremely en-
thusiastic and that enthusiasm seemed to
carry through to Sanbom'.s electric rhythm

section. Equipped with a cordless guitar,
well known session man, Hiram Bullock
was all over the stage, behind the stage, and
even in the crowd, soloing all of the way.
The sold out crowd was no disappointment
_ either. .
Al Iarreau, on the other hand, treated
' this Stanley Theatre audience to a well
organized -and diversified vocal and elec-
tronic show. Highlighted by keyboardists
Tom Canning and Seawinds' Larry
Williams’. , " .
Iarreau performed ten tunes featuring the
wide variety of his famous vocal techni-
ques. One of the great thing about Iarreau
live is his physical animation. He jokes’with
the audience’ and the other musicians,
strolls and runs around stage, acts and
sounds out different instruments, and all
around just has a good time. Highlights in-

,'60’s. -

cluded: "Your Sweet Love,” “Never Give It
Up," "Alonzo" and the Return to Forever-
type ”Spain” from his latest LP This Time.
”Alonzo" featured some nice fluted imita-
tions by Jarreau whereas "Spain," one of
the gems of the concert and the LP boasted
Williams and Canning trading keyboard
solos. Great!

Complacent
Consistency

GORDON LIGHTFOOT
Stanley Theatre
August l6,l98O

By-IANE HOLAHAN

Some things in life never change, and
Canadian Gordon Lightfoot is one of them.

" ”The Ghost of Cape Horn" one of his

newest songs sounds exactly like ”Early
Morning Rain," one of his hits from the

There is something very nice and comfor-
ting about Lightfoot in a timegwhen trends
seem to be changing almost daily. The
crowd at Lightfoot's concert seemed happy
with this consistency, but not ecstatic.

By never changing his musical style over
these 20 odd years; Lightfoot has fallen into
adangerous ritual--all his songs sound the
same. The beauty of ”If You Could Read
My Mind" isllost in the shuffle of the other
20 he performs.

At the Stanley, one got the feeling that
Lightfoot wasn't very excited about any of
his material. Maybe part of this was due to
his laid back attitude, and a lot in the
band's attitude. Lightfoot's four piece
played every song just the same. So they
played and sang "The Wreck of Edmund

Fitzgerald” just the way they played "Sun- ‘

down."
Lightfoot's attempt at a nice rapport with
the audience wasvery successful. No doubt

about it, he is a very nice guy, and he was

generous with his time, playing almost two I

hours. His short encore after a surprisingly
loud and long standing ovation seemed curt

' just the same.

This dissatisfied feeling sprung from
Lightfoot's refusal to take any kind of
chance_:IIIrIeTseem'ed to want to become a
Canadian Institution instead. That's OK I
guess, but it doesn't make fortoo exciting
of a concert.

Carly Simon -
-Warner Bros.

At her best, Carly Simon is a
paradox. Her sexy album covers and -
gutsy singing mask a thoughtful
songwriter who deals introspectively
with lost innocence, love and mar- 5
riage. On Come ‘Upstairs, her latest S’
album. there are a couple of
paradoxes too, but "all the wrong

track, "James" (a very beautiful
tribute to her husband), ”Them"
(which sounds like, the Roche Sisters)
and "Take Me As I Am," the latter
two of which are very witty.

But Carly " Simon is capable 'of

For one thing, how can a woman '

. with the best voice in the business
sound so flat ("Stardust” is almost
painful to listen to)? How, also, can
a woman who-can amaze with such

. introspective songs as "Boys in the
Trees" and "Libby," from Another
Passenger, write such banal and
vague songs this time around?

The thing that made Carly Simon.
differerit was her ability to cut right
to the heart of the matter, but unfor-
tunately Come Upstairs is a retreat
from this intrrospection and a’ turn to
generic songs, with lyrics that don't
mean much of anything.

Fresh noise from the king of

earlier hits, "Free for All" and

TOMMY TUTONE

Tommy Tutone
Columbia

\

Tommy Tutone is a BAND,

fronted by Tommy. Heath and Jim '

Keller. Their debut album Tommy
I Tutone is a fine array of new wave-
tinged, pop/ rock tunes. All ten
songs, including "Cheap Date”, "Girl
"in the Back Seat” and "'-Angel Say
No," deal with that popular theme of

‘ Boy/girl relationships. The musi-/,..

cianship on the album is adequate
and the songs themselves contain
Amemorable pop melodigs. The only

J problem lies in Heath's lead vocals,
which are a mixture ‘of. Graham

- Parker and Van Morrison qualities. '

g With less than appealling harmony
vocals, the overall effect can become ,_

.tiresome~ and uninteresting. _
~ These songs deserve better vocals.

Jackson Browne writes intensly
autobiographical material for his
albums, so you can usually tellihow
he's feeling, and he's usually not feel-
 too well. ‘

In his last studio album, The

. Pretender hewas cynical, what with

’ paint by number dreams and wearing
dark glasses. Well, they say artists

’ aren't supposed to be happy, and
Browne does everything he.can in his
latest album to prove that true.

' Hold Out is -the story of Browne's
life over the past couple of years and V 

although he has fallen in love, and is
soon getting married he still sounds
quasi-miserable. It, takes him a whole
album to tell us he’s'in love, but even
then, we aren't too sure. ,‘ ‘
V When he sings to the girl he loves
(on‘"Hold Out" and Hold On Hold
Out") his lyrics are rather awful. He
spends about 13 minutes hanging on-
to the words ”hold out” as if that ex-
plains everything. Instead I it is a
vague and somewhat irritating im-
age. . ' . ~.

Well, maybehe just wasn't meant
tp be happy, because when Browne
sings about unhappiness (on "Call'It

.A Loan". and "That Girl Could ~

Sing”), his lyrics are" much better, and
much more powerful‘ "

Musically, the album— is terrific, ‘
and Browne's singing has improved‘
. also. The organ of Bill Payne is used .

extensively togood advantage, as is
the singing of Rosemary Butler.

Now I don't want Jackson Browne
to-go around suffering for his art, but
I can't shake the feeling that that is
when he is at his best. ‘

CRIMES or PASSION

Pat Benatar

Chrysalis

Torchy belter Pat Benatar’s new
album, Crimes of Passio,n,"seems to
be striving for that which was lacking»

‘ on In the Heat of the Night, her debut
LP—better material. J But the ten-_

.

song effort drops short ofthe mark,
maybe because the variations of
song-style aren't as schizo as ‘the
premiere Night.

The best numbers are "Never Wan-
na Leave You," "Hit Me with Your
Best Shot," "Little Paradise," and
"Out-A-Touch," but even these don't
peak with the high-tension wire
powérand ”fuck-me" intonations of
her voice. _No real "Heartbreaker”
equivalents. Instead, the melodies
rankin a fair-to-middling redundan-
cy, and except for one or two glints
of surprise (like the zip-gun abort'en-
ding of "Never Wanna Leave You”),
the album becomes fairly predictable.
The only real stand-out is "Hell Is for
Children," the album's most glaring

mistake, since it sounds like a half-.

spunky rock dirge. Even though it

kicks into quasi-gear toward the end,

it is much too late. '
As an overview, Crimes of Passion

' is a disappointment since it doesn't.

plore the range ' she showed she

For another, she's black, not

And, strike three, she's fantastic.

‘Armatrading has more: chutzpah

As rock enters its fourth decade,
women are figuring more and more
prominently than ever before and
Joan Armatrading should be
leading the pack. But Me, Myself, I
is her brilliant seventh album and
she has yet to garner nary a ripple of
response from American audiences.

Armat'rading’s music on Me,

sensitive—this is a woman rocker

ROCK THERAPY

Rockabilly isknown as a maverick
artform. It's a wild mix of country,
blues, and rock .'n' roll, and its
perpetrators are known as true

crazies. They go in a long line from

the early Elvis Presley to Jerry Lee

E Lewis to Ray Campi. And Colin

Winski, an early Campi associate, is

no exception. Rock Therapy con- /

tains 12 songs of enthusiastic, classic
rockabilly. I Terms like frenzied,
manic, relentless, and passionate best
describe the_material contained. My

1 favorite cut is entitled ‘lLove Me,” _

and itgmoves at a driving pace. You
can almost visualize Winski's knees
quivering and his hips shaking as you
listen to him gulp air between
screams, with wildman guitar accom-
paniment by Jerry McGee. At his
mellowest, on "Red Cadillac," Win-
ski remains joyous. Listening to the

entire album can leave you drained.
Even with its new wave endorse-
ment (Winski has opened for the
Clash and Nick Lowe), rockabilly
will probably remain relatively
unknown. Too‘ bad, ’cause an
authentic Colin Winski blows the

OZARK ‘ MOUNTAIN

Ozark Mountain Daredevils
Columbia

The Ozarks are back on a new
label, being promoted ‘in print as
playing ”full scale rock ‘n’ roll and
comparing the new songs to their
past hits "If You Wanna Get To
Heaven” and "Jackie Blue." Ap-
parently whoever ‘ wrote the ads
never took the time to listen to the
album. The songs arexan energy-
deficient, ‘uninspiring collection of
easy pop/ country rock. There are no

obvious hits on the LP. Only‘

"Lovin' You,” which steals a Bellamy

Brothers guitar riff, has much poten— .

tial. The only half-interesting
segments of the album are the occa-
sional guitar solos.

The Ozarks have been losing fans
over the past several years and it's
hard to believe they will gain back
many with this release.

Better luck riext time.

(Continued from page 8)
commissioned in 1911 by the _
Moscow Museum of Fine Arts to

make a series of copies of the finest
examples of early Renaissance paint

“ing. Lochoff was a chemist and in

recreating the paintings, duplicated
the materials and techniques the
Renaissance artists used. It was a
slow process and Lochoff was still
plugging away when the Russian
Revolution broke out in 1917. Ap-

'parently the Bolsheviks had little

use for so bourgeois a project as
copying works of -art. Lochoff
found himself stranded in Italy and
in need of money.

The most renowned art con-
noisseur of this century, Bernard
Berenson, came to the rescue. He

said of Lochoff’s work, "One glance’

around the studio was enough to

. show us that his copies were indeed T

very different from all other copies.
They were alrnost unbelievably ac-
curate reconstructions of. the pic-
tures." ’
Berenson brought Lochoff and j
Miss Helen C. Frick together. She
bought many of the pictures and
when the Frick Fine Arts _Building
was put up in her father's memofy

on the cloister walls. _ A

melody. "Open Up" has some nice

,rhythmic changes and the kind of‘

punch that Chic sometimes lacks.
The gem of the LP is the title cut"

V "Real People." The lyrics are right on

the money and Rodgers supplies an
excellent, lengthy guitar solo. I
"Rebels Are We" is the first gold

‘’ single off of the album (and the sixth

from Chic's four albums) and has
good lyrics and catchy rhythmic syn-
copation. There are a couple of

- . banal tunes called ”I Got Protection"

and the worst, "26." But for the most
part, ‘Real People is an excellent,LP
by Chic.
”Chic-y Keen’!

UNSPOKEN INTENTIONS
Michael Gulezian
Takoma

' This is the second album from this
quite competent guitarist, whose
original songs are performed solo and
run‘ the gamut from fast-moving
classical riffs to a slow, blurry steel-
stringed song, which he dedicates to a
close friend who died of drug abuse.

.Offered here are many types of

songs——all acoustic, never elec-

‘tric—and to the classical guitar en-

thusiast with an interest in recent

trends in popular music, this album is
3

of good fare.
For the guitar lover.

talents justice.
This Time is a collection of“ pop

I love songs, most of which are written ,

or co-written by Iarreau. The tunes
contain‘ little" improvisation, little

. lyrical punch, and an electronic pro-

duction which overshadows ]arreau’s

. voice.

The album has some real bright

spots. .Chick_Corea’s ”Spain” is the 

best voc_al= performance. "Love is
Real" has a quaint lyrical charm and

' a nice scat done by Jarreau with

Seawinds’ Jerry Hey on flugelhorn.

"Distracted" features George Duke .

doing some funky electric piano.

However, ”Distracted” says nothing
lyrically and is drawn out. "Never
Give It Up” and "Gimme What You
Got" are obvious attempts to get a

top-40 audience. These tunes lack '

everything Iarreau is famous for and
replaces it with commerciality.
Individually the tunes aren't bad

(they're not great, either) but collec- -
I tively, they make a blah album.

"This, Time,” ”Alonzo,” "Change
Your Mind,” and ”Love” are ex-

.. amp_les of this. Each of these tunes

are good, but put them together on
the same LP with "Never Give It Up"

.and ”Gimme What You Got,” and
you've got the disappointment of.the X

Al Iarreau's latest‘ album is a well-
produced, smooth—sounding,‘ over-
electronic disappointment. ]arreau’s
‘range’ and voice controTare amazing
and -his vocal improvisations are
among the best in modern music,

No-no, Iarreau.

GARY MYRICK AND THE

FIGURES
Gary Myrick and the Figures
Epic ' f .

Besides the Silencers, this is the
best debut album by an American
band this summer. The first side of

_ the LP rocks, even if "She Talks in

Stereo" has blatant Cars overtones.
”Living Disaster,” "Ever Since the
World Began," and ”Model" include

GARY MYRICK AND THE FIGURES. . .

 

. . . beside THE SILENCERS, this is the best debut album by an American band

this summer,’ '

a great deal of commercial appeal, .
while still retaining their integrity. A

The second side tends to be a drag,
though (a common problem‘ with first
albums).

From the point Myrick screams -
V "Oh yeah!" to open the LP, the

Figures are relentless in their ‘fast,
tight, tough _approach to theirmusic.
Gary Myrick and the.Figures retain
the values. of the Kinks and the Who

(their admitted inﬂuences) and suc-
cessfully integrate them into a
modern commerical musical format.

In some ways this LP is similar to the

debut of Jules and the Polar Bears. 1’

only hope they do better than Jules at

-the marketplace.
