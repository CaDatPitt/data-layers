rector of the Congress on Racial
Equality (CORE), next Wednes-
day. Hans Morgenthau, political
scientist, will speak on the “Di—

lifetime with funny papers.

Series with lectures by the an-
thropologist Ashley Montagu, and

political views. Dr. William
Stanton, Associate Professor of
History, will dicuss the Origins
of Conservatism this Monday.

Kelly, spokesman for the lib-
eral viewpoint, and Richard
Bishirjain, a. leading campus
advocate of Conservatism, is

Local Civil Rights Volunteers
Give ‘Report On Mississippi

. By VICKI EPSTEIN

Where one man falls‘ today, a thousand will stand

A tomorrow. This is the hope in the hearts of Civil Rights

workers in the South.

Four Pittsburgh volunteers who went to Mississippi
this summer to offer their services to the cause of Free-
dom, gave “The Report on Mississippi” to an overﬂowing SU Ball-
room audience Monday evening.

Freedom songs and speeches by volunteers hypnotized the audi-
ence. Along with .adult spokesman the four summer volunteers-Gail
Falk, Sherry Everett, Margaret Dobbins, and Robert Livella—spoke
from their hearts without notes.

“The Report on Mississippi” was a tribute to all the Mississippi
volunteers. It served also as a plan to ask for more help with voter
registration, freedom schools, the freedom party and the needs of
the people of Mississippi. ‘

Miss Everett recounted her experience with voter registration.
The Freedom workers approached Negroes and asked them to register.
They replied that the right to vote was “property of the white man.”
Much trust and convincing went into registering these voters. If
Negroes successfully passed qualifying tests, those registered saw
their names appear in the local newspaper for two weeks. The paper
hoped that the “bossman” would ﬁre these Negroes because they
registered.

An explosion is a common thing in Mississippi today. Miss Ever-
ett knew that the white people were not very happy to see the vol-
lunteers. Forty-eight hours after her group of Freedom workers ar-
rived, a bomb exploded in-the house they were staying. Three hours
after the ﬁrst explosion, there was another bombing attempt on
that house. "

Livella, .also working as a volunteer, related his experiences".

' As the summer progressed one delegate for the Mississippi Free-

dom Democratic Party was needed. The Negroes of Columbus, Missis.
sippi nominated three men for the position. Voting for the ﬁrst nom-
inee at a Freedom meeting, thirty people of the forty in the audi-
ence raised their hand. Twenty.
ﬁve voted for the second man.
The third nominee received forty
votes—a total of 95 votes from
forty people.

The voter education problem
that arose at this meeting had
to be solved. Livella found it
hard to explain why there could
only be one delegate to the con-

Of the 1,350 0wl’s sold, 167

stones in the Schenley Quadrangle. In recent weeksthe University has financed - 7
several such repairs of cement in the Quad area, such as filling in the concrete
squares around the pi'llars supporting the girls’ dorms. It is a logical task for the
Buildings and Grounds department -whose job it is to uphold strict maintenance of
the physical plant for both the beauty and the safety of‘ the campus. It must also
be an expense, ‘considering union wages, but this upkeep is an accepted part of the
5 economy with aplanned place in -the budget. —
‘ mm, But there is another cement job, however, that is not -on the “must” list at
this time—shaving the curbs for the wheelchair students so that they can man-
euver themselves around campus. As those students may recall who were here
this summer, the problem was brought to a head during the spring trimester, but
perhaps we were wrong in anticipating a solution out of these discussions.

A group of _interested student leaders approached Assistant Chancellor of
Student and General Affairs, Aln C. Rankin, earl;)” in the Spring term about the
problem. Since Student Union Administrative Coffee Hour a year ago when the
Chancellor was asked about curb cuts and appointed Dr. Rankin to look into the
problem, no work had been done.

subject of Goldwaterism, its nature
and its prospects.

PROFESSOR SCHLESINGER,
in his writings, has argued that
American conservatism has “strong
tendencies toward schizophrenia,”
for its attempts tolfuse British con-
servatism with the laissez- faire
ideology of American business, the
“offspring being a hybrid that re-
tains little contact with the realities
of either nation.” He maintains fur-
ther that British conservatives,
largely because of noblesse oblige
tradition and the leadership class’
strong soéial consciousness, were not
only receptive to change but indeed

‘were often themselves responsible
for soci'al and economic innovation.

The American business mind,
however, inherits none of this social
responsibility and retains onlythose
ideas which seek to preserve the
right to economic pursuit.

When asked about the phenomen-
on of Goldwaterism (to be distin-
guished from conservatism), Schles-
inger replied that it is a movement
of regional protest without “an or-

resented the average age. There

Beano Cook stole the show dur-

its reflexive negativism exists inde-
pendently of traditional conserva-
tism. The Goldwater legislative rec-
ord (opposition to the minimum
wage, federally-ﬁnanced housing,
aid to higher education, the Peace
Corps, the test-ban treaty, the tax
reduction, and the civil rights bill)
hardly deserves the honor of the
label “conservative,” for the senator
possesses neither its positive tem-
perament nor its constructive ap-
proach to political problems. .

TWO ILLUSTRATIONS come
to mind immediately: First, Senator
Goldwater’s conception of poverty,
and secondly, his awkard posture on
the all -important issue of civil
rights.

In -an address before the Eco-
nomic Club of New York (Jan. 1964)
Goldwater submitted to his pluto-
cratic audience that 7‘most people
who have no skill, have no education
for the same reason —- low intelli-
gence or low ambition . . . ” --

Herein lies the Goldwater ex-
planation of poverty, and inherent
in this kind of reasoning is the So-

‘cial Darwinism .of the late 19th Cent‘-‘"

Columnist Discusses Goldwater, Conservatives
With Former Presidential Aide Schlesinger

that an individual in an industrial-
ized society may be the pawn of cir-
cumstances beyond his immediate
control. Senator Goldwater’s primi-
tive ideas might well have been ut-

tered by a Spencerian disciple of"

the 1860’s rather thaniby a presi-
dential candidate of the 1960’s. ‘

ON CIVIL RIGHTS the Sena-
tor’s sanctiﬁcation of private prop-
erty has placed him in an intellec-

tual impasse. He reaffirms the gos- --

pel that “private property is the
foundation of constitutional govern-
ment,” but then discovers that such
an absolutist notion prevents him
from dealing realistically with the
racial problem. The Senator is more
concerned with the merchant whose
business is being picketed than with
the Negro who does the picketing;

more concerned with law and order 

than with the reasons underlying
the demonstrations.

Senator Goldwater is most cer-
tainly not the leader of the New
Conservatism. He is, however, the
figure in American political life

cheerfully coalesced. ‘ ’ .

‘No mass panic has taken- pl-ace and the coaches
haven’t sacrificed ‘any players for the loss to UCLA
"last Saturday. Determination seems to be on the faces
of the players and coaches at Trees Practice Field.
Coach John Michelosen hoped his team learned
something from last Saturday’s defeat. “The boys made some
mistakes and they should have learned at least a little. I hope
 : they did. If they didn’t the game was of no value.”
 The defense was the disappointment to the fans and the
.71; coaches, and Michelosen wasn’t an exception. “I can’t say I was
satisﬁed with the defense, however, we did play a lot better in
‘the second half.” , A
_ ‘7 _“We had a couple of lapses in the secondary and that cost
plus. We also made a few mistakes on the line, but most of the
‘plays that hurt us were mental lapses, and in the second half
_.,_ I. think we improved. . .
' Two years ago the team lost the first game and it started
4 a mediocre season. Michelosen doubted the team was down-
trodden, “but they have to learn to take defeat with victory.” ‘
, _ Some changes may appear in the starting line-up for Ore-
fgon. “No position is set and the boys will have to hustle to
keep their positions. There may be a few changes, however, in
-the B and C units. ' V
" sQuarterback Fred Mazurek’s fumbles caused consternation
to some of the fans and possibly his lack of contact because of
"-injury he sustained at Meadville was the reason for his un-
I j steadiness.
‘P “Fred had trouble with his leg and his timing was a
I a little otf for the game because he hadn't run. with the first

Cub Grid Crop Seen
i .As Best Since 1960

According to Pitt publicist Beano Cook, this year’s
freshman football crop will be the best since 1960. The
.1960 squad included Paul Martha, Rick Leeson and most
T. of the nucleus of last year’s squad.

Freshman football coach Bill Kaliden, former Pan-

‘ ther quarterback, seems well pleased with his prospects.
He reviewed the list of candi-

 

 the Oregon game in_two weeks. “It felt’ all right for a couple
of plays after I hurt the ankle but on one play when I had to

V push off that foot it just collapsed.”

The other tackle, Jimmy Jones, was also injured when he
had his foot stepped on, but he worked out with the team, in
practice. Injuries to the tackles are disastrous for there is no
depth at that position.

Marv Zelkowitz erred Monday in reporting that UCLA was
running through Ron Linaburg and Bill Howley. It was the

opposite side of the line and not Linaburg’s.

Frosh Soccer Team
Aids Varsity Booters  

By BILL CAPLAN »
Although the soccer team has 12 returning lettermen,
coach Leo Bemis said that “there is an opportunity for
several sophomores to move up to starting positions, and
they will also be needed to give us added depth in the

line.

The important thing to Bemis
is that, “the boys come up from
the freshman squad with enough
preparation to step into varsity
play with a minimum of adjust-
ment needed. Luckily,” he con-
tinued, “our freshmen in the past
couple years have had this prep-
aration.”

Bob McNulty, an alumnus of
the soccer team, has recorded
two undefeated seasons as Fresh-
man soccer coach. Five mem-
bers of last year’s team‘ are
currently vying for starting
positions on the varsity.

This year’s frosh team now has
