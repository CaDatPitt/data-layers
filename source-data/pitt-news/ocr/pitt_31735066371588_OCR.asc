Shootout

Pitt students   urt

in shooting spree

I By Bryan Lee
The Pitt News

Two Pitt students were wounded
Dec. 19 when their Semple Street
apartment building -was sprayed
with bullets from a .22-caliber semi-
automatic rifle. Police were also

fired upon as ‘they arrived atlthe
scene. Charged with aggravated

assault, reckless endangerment and
criminal mischief was Richard Mar-
chese Jr., of 3408 Parkview Ave.

Marchese allegedly went on the.

shooting spree after he had an argu-
ment and shoving match with two
students just inside the door of the
building. .Marchese left shouting
vague threats and said he would

return in 10 minutes. Shortly after,

the shooting began.

Jeffrey Nee, an engineering stu-
dent, and Doug McGin.nis,~—CAS,
were wounded as they celebrated the
end of the semester in their apart-’

‘ ment buildingat 515 Semple St. Nee“ '

was shot in the car when he went
outside after bullets pierced his
apartment window. McGinnis was
shot in the head as he stood near a
window of his apartment. The bullet
entered behind _his "left ear and
lodged in the cerebellum. According
to McGinnis, hadthe bullet traveled
‘only two inches further, he would
have died. Doctors did not ope’rate,
deeming it safer to leave the bullet
alone. McGinnis is recuperating at

available and they were told‘to

CMU A defense Contract   to

By Lisa Keer
The Pitt News

The spotlight has been on Pitts-
burgh in recent months.

Carnegie-Mellon University was
recently awarded a prestigious
Department of Defense contract to
develop computer software. This

move will not only enhance the uni- ,

versity’s national reputation as a

center of high-tech activity but, opti-

istically, provide the Pittsburgh
ea with much-needed jobs and

i_ViA,r,__..)pe for the economic future of

llegheny County. The Allegheny
nference on Community Devel-
vent released its report in mid-
:nber on strategies for the
eunomic development of the Pitts-
ourgh region. ‘ .

The Allegheny Conference report
cited two of the city’s universities,
Pitt and-Carnegie-Mellon, as good
candidates to provide new high-tech
firms with a welcome environment
in which to do business. The report
stressed the research capabilities of
both institutions. '

The" term “high-tech” bears some
explanation. High-tech is usually
defined to include engineering, com-
puter science and industry automa-
tion more commonly referred to as
robotics. High-tech also means that
the skills required of the mentioned
fields are all incorporated into a
business venture. Many of these
businesses are small, relatively new
firms, in contrast to the large corpo-
rations that still abound in the city.

Tim Parks, who heads the High-
Tech Council. of Pittsburgh, indi-
cated that the trend has been and
will continue to emphasize the soft-
ware industries, spinoffs from the
Carnegie-Mellon and Pitt efforts to
involve themselves with this indus-
try. Parks included software engi-
neering, electrical engineering, and
electro-optical and industry auto-
mation in the trend-setting fields.

Parks’ views coincided with those
expressed in the Allegheny Confer-
ence’s report on the economic future

of the Pittsburgh area. In its report, i

the conference recommended a
regional strategy aimed at promot-
ing Pittsburgh as a financial head-

labor force. ,

Pitt graduates whp/want to stay in
Pittsburgh and who have training in
the technological ﬁelds will have an
edge over students with general
degrees for the next five to 10 years,
Parks said. By the same token,
Parks indicated that older graduates
with advanced degrees in computer
science and electrical engineering
will have the greatest choice ofjobs
in the area. Many of the research-
and development-oriented concerns
have expanded into business ven-
tures and will hire senior-level per-
sonnel first.

Parks did not want to discourage
the student pursuing a liberal arts
education, however. Once these new
firms broaden their base of opera-
tions, they will be able to provide
jobs for students with degrees and
experience in business and related
areas of the humanities. These firms
will need managers, accountants,
and later, public relations and com-
munications professionals. Writers

with the ability to convey technical '
information into layman’s terms will ~-

  

   
  

To Know

be particularly in demand, he said.
Parks was unable to comment on

‘the salaries these new high-tech

experts will be able to command. He
felt experience would be an impor-
tant criterion for salary level, but he
also stressed that many of these
revolutionary firms also offer attrac-
tive benefits like stock options and
other incentives.

Unlike industrial giants who set
the standard for professional behav-
ior, the new high-tech companies are
breaking with the suit-and-tie tradi-
tion, an aspect which may attract a
variety of employees with less rigid
mindsets. Parks emphasized that
students contemplating careers with
this type of firm should be interested
in working with a small enterprise
and be willing to exchangejob secu-
rity for the challenge of working in
an experimental and exciting
environment. '

The University of Pittsburgh
placement office is also getting
involved with the high-tech evolu-
tion. Director Robert Hopkins sees
high-tech as moving in’ an “up”
direction. This path is being blazed
by fairly small firms. Hopkins said,

areas of artificial intelligence, robot-’

ics and medical con_sulting
operations.

The placement office works with
the major area employers as well. He
said that firms like Westinghouse,
Dravo, Rockwell and ALCOA all
recruit graduating students with
technically-oriented majors and
degrees. Banks are now starting to
offer more technical -jobs, Hopkins
added, as new automation requires
skilled personnel.

Several months ago, Hopkins
commented to The Pittsburgh Press
that area undergraduates should not
limit theirjob search areato the city,
despite the new high-tech shift and

the attention Pittsburgh has been '

given as a major corporate head-

quarters. Hopkins maintains that’

outlook, “They have to continue to
look elsewhere,” he said. “There are

a large number of graduates in the.

area with the presence of several
major schools: Pitt, CMU and

sary outflow of recent graduates,” he
added. V

What’s the Point?  

As talks begin between Secretary of State George
Schultz and Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko, a
compelling question resurfaces after a year-plus rest:
What’s the -point? Is the point, as President Reagan has
stated often, to rid the world of nuclear weapons forever?
The answer can probably be found in previous arms

limitations talks.

At the last talks (the ones from which the Soviets
withdrew), President Reagan explicitly declared certain v
conditions which had to be met in order for the United
States to reduce any of its nuclear weapons, Key among
these conditions was that the Soviet Union do away with
all of its land-based nuclear weapons. Seventy percent of
the Soviet Union’s nuclear arsenal is land-based. The
Soviets, no doubt, were speechless for several hours
before their withdrawal from the talks.

‘In 1982, the United States significantly lessened com-
munications with the Soviet Union because the Soviets
violated the SALT (Strategic Arms Limitations Talks) II
Treaty. The Soviet Union, notably, had not ratiﬁed that
particular treaty. Neither had the United States.

Questions have been raised by. each party as to whether
the other has supplied nuclear equipment and informa-
tion to third parties that might nullify any concessions
made to the adversary. Each nation has also said that it
shall enter talks in good faith with the best intentions and
that it is certain that these new talks can and will be
productive if only the “other side” will agree to be ﬂexible
and not ask it to give up anything that it doesn’t want to

give up.

This is not to say that these talks will be like all of those
by which they were preceded, for they will not. There is a
fundamental difference between the current talks and all
of its ancestors: The United States is entering them with a_
clear edge. The Soviets seem genuine in their desire for
some form of understanding with the Reagan administra-
tion. If the president is willing to makeimportant conces-
sions, that edge will have meant something good" for the
first time. Unfortunately, the chancesof that happening
seem to be close”to a snowball’s chance for survival in a

A warm place.’

Letters to the Editor

Benjamin Plan Looks Shady

The University Plan: l985-1990,
called the Benjamin Report, is a
blueprint for disﬁguring the state-
related University of Pittsburgh. It is
a radical mastectomy prescribed. by
a president in the twilightof his aca-
demic career who is attempting, with
a single crude swipe of the knife, to
reverse the consequences of nearly
two decades of mismanagement of
one of western Pennsylvania’s most
precious resources. Despite the
plethora of platitudes in the reports
preamble ‘ about “enhancing

. strengths, charting new initiatives

."s.t'L'T'..",.£'Zi72;’.$3§.!77..i"..!53-'27-"25 7 .-9', .,.-'_.‘g",‘,{

and comprehensive planning for
institutional change," the only basis
guiding the report's recommenda-
tions seems to be “if a program,
school or department can’t pay its

own way then let's drop it.” No mat- '

ter that this year Posvar has: i) spent
$13 million to renovate the football
stadium, 2) returned a $2 million
nutrition grant to. the Heinz Foun-
dation, 3) used $2 to $3 million of
undergraduate tuition to bail out the
School of Medicine, whose proﬂi-'
gate clinical departments he has per-
mitted to function wastefully and
unaccountably without proper over-
sight or centralized control since
their inception l0 years ago; and 4)
will spend millions to purchase a
warehouse on Baum Boulevard and

the Jewish Community Center in .

Oakland.

To remain silent is to give support
to: l)" the closing of the School of
Pharmacy, the Ph.D. program in
nursing, and the medical technolo-
gists training program; 2) the dis-
memberment of GSPIA and its
prestigious programs in interna-
tional studies; 3) an extensive
debriding of the School of Educa-
tion (in Provost Benjamin’s words,
for the purpose of getting rid of
“dead wood”); and 4) the disman-
tling of the basic science depart-
ments in the School of Medicine.
Noteworthy is the absence of any
plan to make significant reductions
in the number of administrators.
Faculty members in particular, who
are closest to the Posvar folly, must
join the battle. Or will they, as one of
the characters in a novel by the Afri-
can writer Ngugi asks, “be like the
liyena which tried to walk along two
different roads at the same time”?

The administration would have
the public believe that except for a
few malcontents, the proposals con-
tained in the Benjamin Report are
being widely accepted by the faculty.
Has Dr. Posvar forgotten that only a
few months ago, the faculty of the
School of Medicine voted by a mar-
gin of more than 10 to l in favor ofa
motion to ‘maintain the traditional
structure of the basic science
departments?

changes in the organization of the

are probably necessary. However,
not a single move should be allowed
until the structure and management
of the practice plans of the clinical
departments ‘of the School of Medi-
cine are extensively modified. These
plans generate over $40 million a
year and no one knows for sure
where the money goes. For two
years, the Pratt Subcommittee of the
Senate Budget and Policies Com-
mittee, which was charged with
investigating the activities of the
secret practice plans of the medical
school, was frustrated by the
uncooperative chairmen of the clini-
cal departments who provided .very
little in the way of comprehensive
budget information. Sadly, appar-
ently exhausted by the ordeal, the
members of the subcommittee seem
to have given up the battle and
decided not to hold Posvar to the
agreement‘ he gave at" a Faculty
Senate meeting last January to
report on progress made on accomp-
lishing their recommendations.
Thus, the practice plans remain
largely decentralized, uncoordi-
nated and unregulated by the kinds
‘of strict oversight the medical prac-
tice plans are subject to at first rate
institutions like Duke University
and the University of Iowa.

Clinical practice plans are not
inherently bad. At_ most medical
schools in this country, they serve
the interests of both the physicians
who belong to them and the institu-
tion in which they function. How-
ever, at__ Pitt, the clandestine,
lucrative practice ‘plans serve largely
the interests of their own members,
the university and the public be
damned! As they now operate they
are a powerful destabalizing force
that have profoundly adverse effects
on academic programs in every
corner of the university.

In the midst of thepresent finan-
cial crisis, while the practice plans
provide their members with top-of-
the-line medical and dental plans
and pay for essentially unlimited
numbers of costly trips to interna-
tional meetings, Dr. Posvar con-
tinues the subvention of millions of
dollars from the undergraduate
campus to the School of Medicine.

The misguided practice plans at
‘Pitt have also adversely affected
scholarship: hundreds of junior
faculty are pushed out of the labora-
tories and into the clinics of the
health center to generate income for
the practice plans. Forced to func-
tion as drones, they have little
opportunity to do research and are
eventually shunted off to pure
tenure promotion track. This is
unhealthy.

Vice president Detre would have

us believe the practice plans are

under control, his control. Mugging
and macing clinical chairmen into
giving up their practice plan income

is not‘ an acceptable substitute for
strict governance by published
guidelines and a representative over-
sight committee like those that regu-
late practice plans at most other
U.S. medical schools. We must
reject any proposal that places the
practice plans under the machiavel-
lian control _of one person.

The first thing to do ifyou want to
learn about the practice plans. is not
to listen to the chairmen of one of
the plans providing you with their
selected budget ﬁgures. ‘

It is only fair to acknowledge that
the practice plan revenues do some
good at Pitt. The department of
medicine, for example, has a fine
residency program and does an
excellent teaching job. However,
bear in mind that the department
runs on a chronic annual deficit of
nearly $3 million. This deficit is one
reason why tuition is so high at Pitt’s
medical school and why Dr. Posvar
sends millions of undergraduate tui-
tion dollars up the hill. A dozen
years ago when Pitt’s department of
medicine enjoyed one of the highest
reputations in American medical
education, the faculty numbered less
than 20. Today the department is
approaching a faculty size of 150.
Dr. Posvar should realize the trick is
not to run a first-rate education pro-

- gram with 150 faculty members and

unlimited access to precious, limited
university resources, but instead, to
do so responsibly and without desta-
bilizing the entire School of Medi-
cine and university. At any other
medical school, the excess profits
from practice plans of the depart-
ments of radiology, anesthesiology
or orthopedic surgery would be used
to bail out the department of medi-
cine; not so at Pitt, where the deficits
are covered by undergraduate tui-
tion and medical school tuition.

In closing, I urge everyone who

believes the Posvar-Benjamin initia-
tives to be irrational, destructive and
inimical to the broad goals of a state-

supported institution not to behave
like Ngugi’s’ hyena; instead, stake
out a position and put your views
before the public, your representa-
tives in Harrisburg and the trustees.
Don’t let a lame duck president do a
hatchet job on this great and vital
university; the University of Pitts-

burgh means too much to our com-—

munity. Don’t allow Dr. Posvar to
dismantle a single program at Pitt
and do whatever you can to bring
the clinical practice plans in the
School of Medicine under responsi-
ble supervision and management.
Paraphrasing Stendahl, beware of
those who deceive using ﬁne words

to describe changes that are not ﬁne. '

“So what can you do?" He looked
at me, then up, picked up his coat,
droppinghis hat and two small bun-
dles of test booklets (things which
kept him constantly, comfortably
tied). and waited.

“I suppose just as you think.
Nothing." I gave in. Then I had to
walk away. There’s always some-
thing with him, I thought. Ifit isn’ta
lesson in conduct, it's his damned
propoganda. Dilemmas. Dilemmas.
I’ve no need for dial-advice. lturned
to leave.

“No, wait.” (Two of my most
hated words.)

“All right,” I said. “Really, Mr.
Mann, it's not like I'm not trying or
that I don’t care. There are so many
things, you know? If we wouldn't be
so securely bound by our expecta-
tions, I’m sure we would all be
incredibly productive. Maybe even
do our best. It’s a wonder I accomp-
lish anything at all when I’m perpet-
ually haunted by what you and this
institution expect. Unfortunately,
I’ll admit, I also expected better than
this.”

“Than what?” he asked. Blast. I
really didn’t want to get into it now.
This could be disastrous. I re-think
his original question. My initial
response. Where’s' the loop? I realize

'what’s coming down and stop.

Chance. _

“Well, like what happened to the
discourse? To be honest, sir, you
ramble for 45 minutes on the same
fundamental point, posing the same

central question to this constant
problem, and yet, you don’t allow
anyone to react. The answer, the real

I heart of the matter, weighs over us

like nuclear winter the whole hour. I
watch the others glance up at it every
few minutes, look at each other and
wait for someone to point but no one
does.”

“Oh. And why do you think this is
so?“

“I believe it’s because we've been
thoroughly conditioned to accept
and respect your authority and to
reject the responsibility of pointing
out the obvious.”

He moves a few steps. The man
looks sort of depressed, sort of
angry, and still, I know that he really
doesn’t give a damn about me or
what I may claim to know in my
constant state of delirium. That’s
probably because he’s expected to.
And I, knowing better, had expected
him tocare. It should have been part

of the role he plays.

“As Ioriginally understood it,” he
begins again, “there’s an implicit
contract between us. Now, you may
choose not-to fulfill that. However, I
think there is something you are
missing, and that is that neither you
nor l.are God.”

What?!! That breaks it. And I was
expecting something profound to

voice itself. ,He’s not even an effec- .

tive instrument. There must be
something I can do since there is
nothing to be said, getting back to
his original question, so I decide to

leave, again. .

At times like this, walking away is
an attractive option. At times like
this, when leaving the problem
seems more like a direct confronta-
tion than an evasion of responsibil-
ity, it is the only option. We all need
to leave once in a while. Contrary to
“popular opinion," I'm not walking
away from myself — I couldn’t do
that even if I really wanted to. Nor
am 1 walking away from the prob-
lem at hand since it is something
bigger than both of us and we know

it is. I’t_n walking away from him,

from his stubborn self-denial and
from all this clockwork we call a
university of higher learning, this
power block he’s become a slave to.

-Walking and thinking are two
things that have always come natu-
rally to me — well, walking anyway

V — and from which I derive immeas-

urable pleasure. Though it isn’t pro-
ductive in any social sense, it’s great
for the soul. So. I’m walking and
thinking about slavery, or, more
politely, servitude..

There’s Mr. Mann, for example,
some excuse for a, teacher, more
appropriately titled an instructor, or
“professor,” as we call him, who
cringes at real questions and shuns
finding reasonable answers. A pit-
iful sight, but he enjoys the schedule,
gives objective tests, drives a Mer-
cedes, and pretends to know a lot
about nothing. Consistently, profes-
sors like him view direct questions
and genuine concernwith humor or

contempt. (Please don’t challenge
their authority!) If Mr. Mann really
wanted my honest opinion, and got
it, he would probably make it'impos-
sible for me to attend his class.
Exclusion or avoidance would
surely cure my “attitude problem,”
wouldn’t it?

These “professors,” and many of
their devoted pupils, have become
instruments of the institution, ser-
vants to administrators, mere func-
tionaries of modern minding
machinery, of a “learning factory,”
as Toffler would say. We dutifully
perform our roles, interact with each
other only during classtime (if then)
or minimal office hours, and com-
plain of' not having enough money
or time to do the things we enjoy

doing. (The subconscious mind says,

“ah  but education isn’t enjoya-
ble.”) Even in smaller classes of 15-
3O students, professors use their
prestige and the size of the university

as excuses or barriers which allow

them to become as little involved as‘ .
possible with their students (their A ‘L

actual employers). Going to lunch or
having a drink with an undergradu-
ate is against principle. The lesson is
in the book. Just follow the syllabus.

Many students not only accept .

this divisive situationbut are grate-
ful for it. Being dedicated to an hon-
est education and meaningful
experience is an enormous responsi-
bility. It means we need to be aware,
to be able to communicate.or at least
know how to try and concern our-
selves with things other than what

we’re going to wear tomorrow or I
what bar to go to Friday night. I '
, guess it means that we have to get to

actually know a few people, includ-
ing professors, and that we may need
to share some parts of ourselves that

we're not yet sure nor aware of in _

order to do that. Funny, we’re
expected to know what that means.

To enhance a student’s employa-

course work outside a student's
major, particularly in fields in which
the student may be looking for ajob.
He recommended classes in busi-
ness, management, accounting and

Hopkins was more reflective
when discussing what the university
can do to assist its students. “In our
desire to promote the liberal arts
concept,” he said, “we sometimes
make it a negative badge of honor.”
He added that at times, a degree in a
liberal arts fields seems to have
avoided the sciences among other
areas. “We must not concentrate on
either the purity of an education or
the practical outcome. We should
get both."

Hopkins indicated that despite
the promises of economic stability,
high school and college students
remain worried about their careers.

includes fears that as an adult, the

stems from the last recession, and is
not necessarily valid. “They may be
generalizing about a labor market

said.

A similar anxiety is evident at
Pitt,’ according to Hopkins. Many
student expecting degrees in the
humanities and -social sciences,
engages in activejob hunts, are frus-
trated and angry when they seejobs
cropping up at this time in technical
fields. “It can have a depressing
effect on non-technical majors.” He
added that many technical majors
do not have firm job offers at this
time either, and often go through a
period of self-doubt. “Some get
results faster or slower than others,

to continue their search. '

Revealing quizzes

(USPS) — If you want to
know how you’d score on a sex
IQ test or whether you could
handle a hush-hush affair, Cos-
mopolitan magazine can help
give you some answers.

The publishers of the popular
magazine recently compiled 2l
questionnaires about love, sex
and careers in a new book, “The
Cosmo Quiz Book.”

-Cosmopolitan editor Helen
Gurley Brown said the magazine
quizzes are one of its most popu-
lar features.

“People like it because it’s
about them and their lives,"

Brown said. Of particular inter— -

Magazine quiz book

est are quizzes on love,jealousy,
self-confidence and ambition.

Cosmopolitan’s second book
of quizzes contains tests rating
your party panache, your tele-
phone allure and your ability to
be a good boss. Other quizzes
measure how well you handle
stress, determine how self-
confident or inhibited you are,
and one even tells you if you
should be in psychotherapy.

“No magazine or book can
really claim to profoundly affect‘
someone’s life,” says Brown. M
“But I will say that these quizzes
will help pinpoint some things
you sort of suspectedabout
yourself."’,

Deadline draws near ,

Pitt students have less than one
month to apply for study abroad
scholarships for \the coming
summer. Sponsored by the Nation-
ality Rooms and Intercultural
Exchange Programs, the scholar-
ship competition is open to graduate
and undergraduate students who
will have earned 60-90 credits by

. April .1985. Additional eligibility

requirements and assistance in
selecting a career-related, credit-
worthy study program abroad are
available through the Nationality
Rooms Program, 1209 Cathedral of
Learning, or the study abroad ‘office,

4Gl2 Forbes Quadrangle.

The scholarships, which range
from $700 ‘to $2,000, are the result of
a year-round fundraising by the
Nationality Rooms committees, the
Nationality Council and by individ-
ual donors. Some scholarships are
country specific; others allow the

student to select the country of his or 9

her choice.

To be considered for a scholar.-
ship, students must complete an
application and be interviewed.
Interview deadline is Jan. 30; appli-
cation deadline is noon Feb. 1. For

WORLD

(UPI) — The United States and
the Soviet Union have extended cru-
cial arms talks in Geneva for another
session. And with a total news black-
_out in effect, the announcement
raises some unanswered questions.
The main one is whether the exten-
sion is being made because of a
deadlock or progress? The U.S. will
only say it is hosting the fourth ses-
sion. The Soviets said nothing.

_(UPI) — U.S. and Soviet negotia-
tors are meeting in Moscow for what
is described as, the highest-level trade
talks in six years. The meeting began
quietly with world attention focused
instead on the arms talks in Geneva.
The Moscow discussions are
expected to cover ways of increasing
trade between the‘ two nations.
Trade dropped off sharply after the
Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in
l979.

(UPI) —— Gunmen kidnapped an
American Roman Catholic priest
from the streets of Beirut and sped
off with him, clearing their path with
sprays of machine gun fire. Police
and witnesses said‘ the six gunmen
intercepted the car of the Reverend
Lawrence Jenco in Moslem West
Beirut and forced him into another

car. He’s the eighth American
.abducted in Beirut since last
February.

(UPI) — Europe has been freezing
in a killing cold wave blamed for
about 80 deaths in six countries. The
lowest temperatures in decades have
been reported. France, Italy and

Spain have suffered the most with.

almost 40 deaths between them. The
Arno River at Florence, Italy, has
frozen over and Paris subway sta-
tions have been ordered to remain
open to provide shelter for the

PENNSYLVANIA

WEST CHESTER, Pa. (UPI) —
Police said yesterday that a 50-year-
old man was killed when an
out-of-control tractor-trailer
slammed into the side ofthe building
where he worked. The truck, loaded
with steel coil, was traveling north

on Pennsylvania Route 202 in Ches- I

ter County atabout 8 a.m. when the
driver lost control. Police said they
believe the driver attempted to stop
the truck by driving it into the park-
ing lot ofthe Birmingham Township
Municipal and Commercial Office
Building, but the vehicle slammed
into the structure. Police said James
Dever, owner of a company housed
in the building, was fatally injured in
the accident. He was pronounced
dead at Chester County Hospital.
The truck driver was in serious con-
dition at the hospital. His name was
not immediately released. An inves-
tigation of the inc-ident is
continuing. ‘

(UPI) — An appeals court has
ruled that police didn’t need a war-
rant to seize what proved to'be mari-
juana plants from an_open pit. The
ruling Monday by State Superior
Court upholds a Northhampton
County court’s. conviction.

PITTSBURGH (UPI) —
Workers in Allegheny County will
now be forced to retire when they
reach the age of ,70. The move was
approved Monday at a meeting of

the County Salary Board. The pol- A

icy will go into effect July 22 and
affect 76 employees this year.
Employees over 70 on that date can
work until they turn 71. District
attorney Bob Colville voted against
the measure and said it discriminates
against elderly workers. The provi-
sion was included in union contracts
negotiated last year. The policy was
put into effect in order to create jobs
for younger workers.. -

will not fly Continental Airlines

because of a pilots’ strike. Among

those signing a full-page ad in USA
Today are actors Daniel J. Travanti,

The ad charged that Continental has

HOUSTON (AP) — Cars and
trucks were lining up-at two Hous-

Pitt Athletes Take No Holiday

By Kirsten Gostony
The Pitt News

The Pitt Panthers made their
Eastern Wrestling League debut on
Monday evening with a strong
showing against West Virginia Uni-
versity. Unfortunately, the Panthers
were unable to retain the lead they

- had and lost to the Mountaineers

19-15.

with a win in the 118-pound cate-
gory. The Mountaineers‘ Jeff Ess-
wein was awarded a point for riding
time, which enabled him to record a
7-6 victory over Pitt’s Joe Iagnema.

The Panthers quickly retaliated
with victories in the two matches
that followed. John Hnath defeated
his opponent at 126 lbs. with an 8-4
decision over Mike Levanduski.
Hnath had lost to Levanduski ear-
lier in the season when the two
wrestlers met on the mat at Penn
State’s Invitational. At 134 lbs.,

‘Pitt’s Kyle _Nel1is_ recorded a victory
with a technical fall in ‘the third
period, which put the Panthers
ahead 9-3. ‘

Pitt recorded additional wins at
150 and 158 lbs. Gary Bolin (I50
lbs.) defeated his opponent 4-l,
while Joe Bond (158 lbs.) recorded a
9-2 victory. ‘However, at 167 lbs.,
Pitt’s Doug Haines was unable to
gain a point for riding time as he was
short only one second. West Vir-
ginia’s Gordon Taylor recorded the
victory with a score of 7-6. The most
pivotal bout of all was at "190 lbs.
when Panther Jack Uppling was

defeated 9-2, which tied the score at _

15 each. A . »
The night’s outcome was decided
by the heavyweights. Injured
Panther Curt Conner fell to oppo-
nent Mike Sawtalle l7-5. Conner
refused to use his knee injury as an
excuse. “The injury ‘mostly affected
me_ only when I was on the bottom,
explained Conner. “Other than that,
it didn't really affect me. I guess I
just don‘t like to make excuses."

Rodney Dangerfield‘s classic
comment, “I went to the fistﬁghts
the other_night and a hockey game
broke out,” may not sound so out-
rageous to hockey fans, who often
witness brawls on the ice. The Pitts-
burgh Hockey‘Club managed to
squeeze in some hockey in their
game against Duquesne exactly one

month ago today, which the Pan-

thers lost 6-3. ' ~
It. was a rare moment when both

penalty boxes were unoccupied.
Both teams were shorthanded much
of-the time, keeping the power play
opportunities‘ to a minimum. ‘The
question arises whether the players
were committing more penalties or if
the referees were just being more
strict in making the calls; The Pan-
thers feel it was a little of both. “You
can't beat the refs," commented
right wing Roger Oldaker, who was

thrown out of the game early in the
secondrperiod on a butt-ending call.
“I hardly touched him,’_' asserted
Oldaker. “I was waiting for this
game since the beginning of the
season, and then I got thrown out.”

“It was‘ a very exciting game,"said
Coach Jim Owens Sr. “The boys on
the bench were all pepped up for it."
‘The Panthers carried this intensity
out onto the ice with them, bringing
forth a hard-hitting, emotional
game. There appeared to be hope for
the Panthers near the end of the
second period when a goal from left
wing Jim Owens Jr. tied the game at
three, but in the third period the
Dukes added three more goals and
handed the Panthers their second
loss of the season.

“We just broke down mentally in
the third period from killing all
those penalties,” said left wing Marc

‘ Bowers.

‘“Duquesne’s team is real good,"

acknowledged center Jim Lang.

“They’re real disciplined and that.

Hockey; win one, lose one

helps. They’re a fast team and they
were better at a lot more things than
we expected." . I

The . Panther's biggest challenge
came from Duquesne center Ray
Conway, whose speed kept his com-
petition at ‘a safe distance and put
him in good scoring position. “Con-
way played a hell of a game.” said
Panther defenseman Tom Dieffen-'
bach after the game. Conway and
teammate Pete Flanagan led. the
Duquesne scoring attack_with three
goals apiece.

Goalie John’ Godwin did an
incredible job against Duquesne
with 40 saves on -46 shots on goal.
“John Godwin played out of his
mind," said Oldaker. The Panther
goaltending has been consistently
strong throughout the season.

The Pittsburgh Hockey Club will
have at least one more opportunity
to overcome Duquesne this season,
and many of the players remain
optimistic that they can accomplish

Since last.season’s disappointing’ 6 ‘

loss to Temple in the NCAA Tour-
nament, Mother Hubbard has
encountered both joy and sadness._
Lou Carnesecca of St‘.-John’s made

six acquisitions, numerically. 

matched only by Connecticut.

Included therein is Walter Berry,_the -

slippery forward who eased in -28.9
points and 14 rebounds per gamefolr
San Jacinto, the national JUCO
champs, last year. ‘ i '

Looie loves him. “He gives us
something we didn’t have last year,

What he leers at is a piecein this‘

. tom interviews and allegations _he . I

manner, if not purportedly breaking

All Looie lives for now is his 16th   3

with Berry.
“He'll help us out withhis ability

to put the ball in the basket.at--all — I‘ 
different angles,” Mullin said. “No,.« 

matter where he is, he finds a way:to:

put. the ball in the hole. It really ,
doesn’t take the pressure off me, it

helps the whole team." ’ .; .
The backcourt duo _of Mike

Moses and Mark Jackson is an"  

aspiring one. The two New Yorkers
spent the summer in the City College
League preparing for Berry/ Mullin

double-teaming. Only Jackson and

Berry are underclassmen, to be
assisted by forwards Willie Glass

and Ron Stewart and instant-' 
production newcomers like 6-'_l

“Pearl will have the ball 80 per-
cent of the time. If he's not in con-

trol, then we've got problems," said
_ senior Andre Hawkins. '

The 6-8, 240-lb. Hawkins seem-

. ingly had problems three years

hence at center but will ﬁnally move
to more natural power forward.
Taking his place will likely be a cou-
ple of foreigners. Sophomore
George Papadakos, from Ontario,
came on strong late last year and will
likely alternate with Lebanese-born
Ron Seikaly, a froshfrom Athens.

As freshmen they arrived at Vil-
Ienovs with business cards announc-
ing their presence. By now everyone
knows “Easy” Ed Pinckney,
Dwayne McClain and Gary
McLain, seniors who scored 35.9
ppg as juniors. Addjunior frontman
Harold Pressley and there appeared
13.3 more per game.

Pinckney, though, is the star busi-
nessman. Of the 95 possible games,
he’s played in 94, starting 84. Later
this season, he’ll surpass the 1,000
mark in scoring and rebounding
whether at center or forward. “I
come out with the attitude that no
matter where you're at on the court,
you play to the best of your ability,"
Pinckney said.

Backing him up just the same are
Chuck Everson and Wyatt Maker,

while Dwight Wilbur and Harold
Jensen give-and-take at the guard
spot Allderdice-product Frank
Dobbs vacated.

The year ended unceremoniously
for Boston CoIIege’s Gary Williams.
Senior Martin Clark publicly
embarrassed him and then accused
him of cheating whilerecruiting Jay
Murphy, another senior. Williams
today still lacks player experience,
including untested centers, but the
year of the little big man continues.
From b‘ehind<Doug Flutie emerges
Michael Adams, a spritely point
guard who produced 17.3 ppg des-
pite the 5-10 size.

“I hope he has a great year,” Willi-

ams emphasized. “As a senior, he '

realizes what he has to do. Michael
has been very successful for us in the
past two years."

The fatherly backcourt includes
senior Stu Primus as the BC
strongholds end there. Roger
McCready has not produced at cen-

ter (only 3.7 rpg last year), so Willi- -

ams may sit him down in favor of
JUCO transfer Trevor Gordon, a 6-
9 junior. Right now the only viable
replacements for Murphy and Clark
are Troy Bowers and Russ Doherty,
a shocking 4.2 ppg between "them
last year. ‘ I _

And don’t forget two newcomers,
Skip Barry and Tyrone Scott. Pretty
shallow.

Except for Earl Kelley, Connecti-
cut Coach Dom Perno had nothing
set prior to the December “presea-
son.” Then, just before the Fairfield

opener, what does swingman Eddie -

Williams do but fracture a right-
hand bone in practice. The promis-
ing junior eventually began playing
later as UConn crawled to a 3-3
start.

Perno looks for the magic of a
winning season two years absent
from Storrs after he went to four

‘straight postseason tourneys.

“I think the biggest headache is we
lost the chemistry we had, and we
had ‘great games against Pittsburgh
and St. John's and then [Kelley] gets
hurt against Syracuse,” Perno said
of last year. “Earl never did get back
to where he was, there goes our sea-
son [l3-l5]. We need him in there.
Not that he answers all the problems
we have, but we need someone who
will be a signiﬁcant threat.“

Kelley, UConn’s scoring leader
the last two years (only 44 percent
field goal shooter), plays the point
this year for the first time with Gerry

Besselink likely moving to shooting

guard. Up front Perno will cross his
fingers for 6-7 center Tim Coles,
who had 7.9 rpg last year.~

but that was in Hawaii and Olden
Polynice was lamenting his honor
code trial.

Nobody returns with double-
figure scoring; and Mullaney
changes his frontcourt combo at
will. “We’ve got kids who can shoot
it but used tojam it into Otis more,”
he said. “We don't have the guy
where, here, take the ball and create
your own play.”

Nowadays no one knows who,
among Seton Hall and Providence,
belongs in front of the other. Eter-
nally, the Pirates’ PJ. Carlesimo
rebuilds as if he’s architecting the
Tower of Babylon. Will it ever end?

“A winning .record has to be one
of our goals," he said. “To do that
you need exceptional defense and
you still have to find five or six
games in a layer to have a winning
record. With young players, that can
be difficult.”
has so far surpassed beyond
anyone’s anticipation. The other, a

ered on him, much less any praise at
all. But that was a while ago.

Now the two, Charles Smith and
Keith Armstrong, play basketball
together in a kind of harmony that
likely’ pleases the latter more than
the former. Who cares, though,
when you’re winning? The Panthers
are doingjust that, rolling along at a

  

    

 
  
 
    
       
         
      
      
   
   
 

9-2 (1-0 in the Big East) clip as they
head into their semi-annual make-
or-break week.-

Saturday night, it’s offto Storrs to
face Connecticut for only Pitt’s
second road game. The horizon
beyond reads consecutive home
games against St. John’s and
Georgetown (Civic Arena).

As the conference races heat up,
two role players include Smith, the
freshman difficult to bad-mouth,
and Armstrong, the former fresh-
man and sophomore whose 6-9, 244-
lb. frame couldn’t duck the verbal
assaults of yore.

Already the scoring leader in four
games, Smith leads the Panthers in
scoring (12.8), rebounding (7.4) and
blocked shots (22). Usually, one
equates the center with the swat shot
leader, but Armstrong only has ll.
Not to worry. He’s shored up other
more important areas. Last year the
junior got 4.4 rebounds per game as
opposed to his 6.6 nowadays, and
his 10 points every contest out-
shadow last year's famished 5.5.

“I was disciplined to the point that
I wanted to score,” Armstrong said
last month, “but I needed game
experience. But I wasn’t disciplined
that much. It was inexperience
because I found myself out of posi-
tion a lot. Iwas going for garbage
rebounds, going for blocks when I
knew I couldn’t get them.

“Now I’ve learned to stay in con-
trol defensively or offensively. I just
take my time and do things
positively.” _

Smith appreciates the contribu-
tions but belabors his 48 percent
from the floor. “I'd-like to have it

' higher,” he said, “but it goes up and

down. It fluctuates. I'm a streaky
player. One night I'll hit just about
every single one and then on another
I might get six points. It depends on
what type of position I’m playing
and what kind of game it is.”

To date, the Panthers are playing
only their kind of game, winning by

’ an average margin of 19 points. Typ-

ical of that was Saturday night’s 73-
62 pastingof Providence.

“The big thing as far as the game is
concerned is we are able to control
the tempo of the game and we've
been living and dying with the run-
ning game, putting in and taking out
players,” head coach Roy Chipman
said. “Our bench played well. Curtis
Aiken is doing a fine job getting the

ball up court, pushing it hard. Offen- '
sively and defensively we uptem-'

poed the game.”

That sounds good — if you’re
playing at home. But the Fitzgerald
haven will not be so readily available
the next two months. Witness, if you
would have wanted to, the loss to
Florida State in Orlando after the
Panthers blew a 14-point halftime
lead. .

“We lost that one in the stretch,”
Smith said. “I think we kind of

slacked up. We were all in foul-

trouble.”

Smith joined Armstrong and
senioriChip/Watkins (6.3 ppg) in
various bouts with foul ﬂu earlier in
the year, one reason why teams

waste December on getting kinks -

out of their systems. With_the Big
East beckoning, scoring leaders
don’t belong on the bench unless you
believe you belong in the conference
cellar. ' ‘

Nevertheless, Chipman. piped in,
“We're handling the ball better,
we're making better choices and

. we’re not forcing in many places.

Aiken is the big reason. He has ever-
yone playing at a higher pace. He’s
playing with a lot of confidence.”
To which the sophomore will say,
“I think we should be ll-0.” E

Panthers Get No ResPect” from Dukes  I

this feat. “I know we're good enough
to beat them,” defended Bowers.
“We can easily beat them player for
player.” However, optimism alone is
not going to miraculously create a
Duquesne victory for the Panthers.

“The morale isn't good anymore,”
confessed junior Owens. “Everyone
is worried about themselves instead
of the team. If we expect to beat the
better teams, we have to start play-
ing more as a team and not worry so
much about ourselves.”

The Panthers record now stands
at 7-2-I after a -ecent 15-2 victory
over Allegheny er. the Civic Arena.
“Allegheny is much improved since
the last time I played against them,”
said center Jeff Bell. “They were

actually trying to run us out but they
just couldn’t do it.” Bell, a freshman,
had four goals against Allegheny,
his second hat trick since transfer-
ring to Pitt. After only five games
with the Panthers, he is already
totaling 19 points. ‘.‘It’s a team
effort,” said Bell, referringto his suc-
cessful record. “One person can’t do
it by himself.”

Jim Lang and Marc Bowers also
had ‘hat tricks for the Panthers. This
is Lang’s fourth hat trick of the sea-
son and Bower‘s first. “Their defense
was slow and they coughed the puck
right _to me. I have good linemates
who got me the puck. They [Allegh-

eny] had some good skaters but their

goalies were weak,” said Bowers.
The Panthers‘ next game is on
Saturday at Lakevue against CMU.

first half, sparked the Celtics to a
two-point halftime edge. New

Track team

in Va. tourny

By Rich McKenzie
The Pitt News

On Dec. 8, the University of Pitts-
burgh's men’s track team traveled to
Fairfax, Va. to participate in the
George Mason Invitational Track
Meet at George Mason University.
The meet, which was the team’s last
before semester break, is not scored
as far as team competition is con-

cerned, but the Panther squad fared.

quite well. Coach John Vasvary

. said, “I ‘am very pleased with our

performance, especially since it is so
early in the ‘season and so many of

- our guys are running well,”

There were many outstanding
performances in the meet; Lee
McRae not only finished first in the
300-meter dash with a time of 34.3
seconds, but also set a new school
and meet record in the 55-meter
dash with a time of6.0. Both ofthese
times also qualified the talented
sophomore for the ICAAAA in
March. Also ﬁnishing first for the
Panthers, in the 55-meter hurdles,
‘was freshman Calvin Holmes with a
time of 7.1. In the same event,
sophomore Jason Harris finished
third with a time of7.4. Both ofthese
times were also good enough _to
qualify these runners for the
ICAAAA. .

Three Panthers finished in the top
five in the 800-meters. Tim Manes,
Scott Abel and Alan Laws finished
second, fourth and ﬁfth with times
of 153.6, 154.4 and 154.4 seconds,
respectively. Manes’ time of 153.6
qualified him for the ICAAAAS. In

e'the I500‘-meters, freshman Joe

Daniels ran to a second‘-place finish
with a time of 355.0. _
In the medley events, the team of
Rodney Giles, Alan Laws, Scott
Abel and Tim Manes finished first in
the two-mile relay with a time of 7:43
and qualiﬁed for the ICAAAAS. In
the distance medley,-a race in which
the runners go one-half, one-fourth,
three-fourths and one mile respec-
tively, the Panther team of Mickey
Rihtarchik, Shane Saunders, Joe

-Daniels and Bob Weiner finished

third.
The meet did have one sour note:
In the 1000-meters, Rodney Giles

was leading and would have'cer- ‘

tainly qualified for the ICAAAAS
but was inadvertantly tripped from
behind and didn’t ﬁnish the race. In
that same race, Bob Weiner finished
in ﬁfth place with a time of 228.2.
This Saturday, the Panthers
travel to‘Cha'pel Hill, N.C., to com-

pete in the North Carolina Invita-'

tional.

Lady Panthers Ioseeé-64 . 

By Jim (lrban
The Pitt News

Pitt and Villanova squared off
last night at Fitzgerald Field House
in a battle for supremacy in the Big
East Conference. Villanova used a
layup by sophomore Shelly Penne-
father with six seconds remaining on
the clock to power the Wildcats to a
65-64 victory over the Panthers.

Villanova jumped out to an early
lead in the first half with Pitt shoot-

ing poorly (34 percent), and if it were '

not for Pitt Coach Judy Saurer’s
inserting sharpshooter Becky Mazi-
arz into the lineup, Villanova might
have run away with the game.

Pitt trailed 26-22 late in the first
when Maziarz came off the bench
and popped three straight’ jumpers
and added a" layup at the buzzer to
give the Panthers their first lead at
32-30. .

The lead changed throughout the
second half. Pitt's Ellen Gilhooley
and Villanova‘s Lisa Angelotti
tradedjbuckets again and again until
the score was knotted at 63. With 19
seconds remaining, Maziarz took
the ball in the corner, moved
towards the key, and was fouled by
Villanovafs Teresa Pasik. Maziarz
missed the first and made the second

, of two foul shots, and Pitt lead by

one 64-63.

After a scramble for a loose ball,

Villanova won a jump ball and A

calledtimeout with nine seconds on
the clock. Pasik lobbed the ball into
Pennefather who sunk the winning
bucket.

Villanova Coach Harry Perretta
said of the last timeout, “We ran a ,

play that works against both man

and zone defenses. I told Pasik‘

where to throw the ball after] recog-
nized the defense.”.

Pitt brought the ball down in one
final attempt, but Gilhooley’s corner

jumper rolled off the ri_m as the ﬁnal _ L I

buzzer sounded.

Perretta was ecstatic about the
win. “This was a big win for us. We
are a young team,” Perretta said,
“and to come here and win is great.”

Saurer, perhaps not satisﬁed with

her squad’s performance, had no-

comment. , ,
Pitt was led by Gilhooley with 21
and Jennifer Bruce ‘with 16, while
Villanova was led by Angelotti with
2l.- '
