Pitt Senior Maris Bondi relaxes after a morning of volunteering at Presbyterian

Volunteer witnesses daily
duties, transplant in local OR

By Kathleen Scanlon
Senior Staff Writer

(Editor’s note: This is the first in a
two-part series.)

Pitt senior Maris Bondi, perched atop
a stool, peered over the shoulders of
doctors performing a liver transplant
last week.

The patient’s stomach was wide
open, and Bondi could see all the
organs. Four surgeons hovered over the
patient to take the old liver out. She
saw the new liver sitting in the corner
of the room in a plastic bag on» top of
some ice. She couldn’t touch anything
because of the sterile environment, but
the view she had was rare and exciting.

“I was basically looking over their
shoulders,” Bondi said. “I was wide-
eyed. I was in awe because I’d like to
be doing that someday.” _

Bondi, a pre-med student, volunteers
in the Presbyterian University Hospital
operating room along with 1-1 other
students. This is the first semester stu-

dent volunteers have entered the OR
and very few, if any, other hospitals in
the country allow their volunteers: such
an inside view. Pat McArdle, who
trains the volunteers, said tha.t’s
because the hospitals would have‘ to
hire someone to supervise and train.
McArdle meets this need in Presby’s
OR by volunteering himself. He said
the OR could use about 20 more volun-
teers. ,

Bondi’s volunteering day started at
4:59 a.m. when she woke up a minute
before she had set her alarm to go off.
She had to get ready at her Oakland
apartment and be atthe OR by 6:45
a.m. Her shift would start at 7:00.

“Pat made a good point,” she says.
“He said, ‘If you want to do this for a
living, you better get used to getting up
this early.”’ .

Bondi volunteers every Wednesday
morning for three hours, the minimum
time commitment volunteers are asked
to make. She helps the nurses and aides
to prepare operating rooms for surgery

Pitt millions

By Kathleen Scanlon
Senior Staff Writer

Pitt may lose a $3.2 million reason to
keep tuition low.

The proposed state budget leaves no
room for a grant that awarded extra
funds to schools that limit their yearly

tuition increases to 4.5 percent. Pitt '

received $3.2 million during the last fis-
cal year after keeping the tuition hike at
4.5 percent, according to Ken Service,
Pitt spokesperson. '

The state-owned and state-related
schools that participated in the Tuition
Challenge Grant program agreed to the
cap on tuition increases in exchange for
being able to partake of a pool of about
$100 million.

Altogether, Pitt received a state

appropriation of $147.2 million last .

year, which included the money from
the Tuition Challenge Grant.

Though some may wonder whether
the disappearance of the grant will
prompt state-related schools to raise
tuition at a higher rate than 4.5 percent,
Pitt’s next move, will_have to take its
declining 'enrolIitne'r'.l't"5.’ figures 7”i*n‘to con-
sideration.

Some have argued that the Challenge
grant was unnecessary, that market
forces will be enough to keep tuition in
check.

Pitt’s enrollment management com-
mittee even recommended lowering
tuition for out-of-state students.

“Our argument was that [the gover-
nor] didn’t need to artificially challenge
us [to keep tuition down],” said Arthur
Ramicone, associate vice—chancellor for
budget and administration. “The market
was already doing that.”

Enrollment figures at Pitt have steadi-
ly dropped since 1990, by a total of
about 2,000 students. This prompted the
board of trustees last June to approve a
4.5 percent increase in tuition for the
fiscal year 1996.

Though Pitt’s budget for the next fis-
cal year is still in its early planning
stages, there have been indications “that
we would try to keep the tuition

Condoms: the valentinefs gift of the '90s

By Nicole Wilson
For The Pitt News

Lovers may soon forget long-
stemmed roses and heart-shaped candy
as symbols of Valentine’s Day. The
American Social Health Association
has dubbed Feb. 14 National Condom
Day to remind people of the importance
of the rubber prophylactic.

‘‘Valentine’s Day is a good time to '

have this reminder, since people are
thinking about romance,” said ASHA
public relations staff. member Elinore
Coates. “It’s a national holiday for
lovers, and in the ‘90s that means lov-
ing responsibly.”

ASHA hopes that associating con-
doms with Valentine’s Day will encour-
age couples to discuss safe sex, accord-
ing to Coates.

“It is crucial that sex partners talk
openly about the sensitive subject of
sexual health and use condoms to pro-
tect one another from sexually trans-
mitted diseases,” said ASHA_President-
Peggy Clarke.

“Many couples find that sex is more
enjoyable if they don’t have to worry,
about getting an STD,” Clarke said,
“and open communication about sexual
health can lead to greater intimacy.”

ASHA will sponsor National Condom
Day by sending information about sex-

ual health to schools and media
sources. ASHA also offers a free

‘brochure, “Condoms, Contraceptives

and STDs,” that discusses how well
various methods of birth control pre-
vent STDs and shows how to use male
and female condoms properly.

A condom is an “excellent choice”
for preventing STDs, according to the
brochure. It says that condom use is a
way of protecting oneself without giv-
ing up sexual pleasure.’

ASHA estimates that 55 million
Americans have STDs, with 12 million
new infections occurring each year.

“Because so many STDs have very

cent,” Service said. But that
figure may change, especial-
ly in light of the latest infor-
mation out of Harrisburg.

The state budget allows for
Pitt to receive the same total
amount that it did last year.
And the preliminary enroll-
ment projections suggest that
total enrollment will not
increase, according to
Ramicone.

“Times are tough,” he said.
“If you’re getting nothing
extra from the state and your

something to be looked at.”
Interim Chancellor Mark
Nordenberg will appear
before the state House
Appropriations Committee
Feb. 27 and the Senate
Appropriations Committee
on March 5 to lobby for
more funding from the state.
The current version of the

. budget still has ‘to go

through the legislature for

- approval.

Pitt’s budget goes through
the University Planning and
Budgeting Committee, and
then must go to the chancel-
lot for approval.‘ The board
of trustees has to approve
any tuition increase. Usually
the budget finds its final
form by the end of June.

Tragic but not heroic

When was the last time you watched a boxing match? If you’ve
ever tuned in for a match, from amateur Olympic trials to high-pro-
ﬁle championship matches, you’ve probably seen the close-up
shots of the ﬁghters between rounds. Eyes are swollen shut, sweat
is dripping to the mat and blood is pouring from any number of
cuts on the boxers’ faces. And that’s what makes boxing fun, right?

You can admit it: Most of us tune in to athletic events in the hope
of seeing a fight. Hockey and football are great for that kind of
thing, and even baseball has its moments. But boxing is ﬁghting;
that’s why it’s so popular.

But what makes boxing fun to watch is also what makes it dan-
gerous for the athletes. Despite the high risk factor created by
blood ﬂying, boxing’s national regulatory group does not require
AIDS testing for participants. Only four states have rules that
require all boxers to be tested — Arizona, Washington, Nevada
and Oregon.

Fortunately for some competitors, Tommy Morrison was sched-
uled to ﬁght in Las Vegas. That is where he learned that his pre-
fight HIV test came back positive. This might just save any of his
scheduled opponents from the risk of trading blood while trading
punches. Unfortunately, any of Morrison’s former opponents might
have already done so. .

With such a serious risk posed by fighting a person infected with
HIV, there needs to be a testing system in every state, not just in
four. Hopefully, this tragic experience for one boxer will be the cat-
alyst that creates the system which could save many more than one
in the future. '

There is another aspect of this story which cannot be overlooked.
There is some suspicion that Morrison knew of his condition
before a test confirmed that he had HIV. But Morrison was a popu-
lar figure in the boxing world. There is a very real possibility that
we will soon hear stories‘ of Morrison’s “heroic ﬁght against a
deadly disease stronger than any of his former opponents” or
something like that. Morrison is more likely to be glorified for
risking so much than to be viliﬁed for putting so many at risk.

Magic Johnson and Greg Louganis are both proof that sports ﬁg-
ures infected with HIV are given special preference. Both compet-
ed in athletic events while they knew they were infected, putting
their competitors at risk. But instead of worrying about who else
might have been affected, each was held up as a “victim fighting a
heroic struggle.” The only thing any of these men were victims of
was their self-admitted promiscuous lifestyles. They slept around,
and they got HIV. —

. It is truly tragic to hear that someone you know is infected with
such a deadly disease. When a national ﬁgure gets the disease,
mourning reaches national proportions. And though there is noth-

For a presidential front-run-
ner, Bob Dole is in an awful
position. Despite the fact that
he is a veteran Washington,
D.C. insider and savvy politi-
cian, Dole’s inept presidential
campaign has led many
Republicans to look elsewhere
for an alternative. A recent
poll showed that in a presiden-
tial race between Clinton and
Dole, Clinton would win.
Other polls have showed that
Dole is losing his lead in the
primaries over his fellow
Republican challengers. Why
is Dole, a practiced politician
and skilled strategist, having
so many problems?

Dole should not be having
any problem at all. The senator
seems to hold all of the cards:
The Republican field for 1996

. is extremely weak, and he has
extensive name recognition, an

almost 30 percent lead over his
nearest competitor in the polls
and over $17 million in the
bank. Why isn’t Dole waltzing
to victory as he should?

The simple reason is that
Dole is out of step with the

‘modern Republican party.

Today’s GOP is young, con-
servative, concentrated in the
South and blisteringly parti-
san. -Dole, in contrast, is old (if
elected he will be the oldest
president in history), moder-
ate, from the Midwest and a
conciliator. Elected to
Congress in 1960, Dole is a
relic from the era when the
GOP was the minority party
and was concentrated in the
rural Midwest.‘In Dole’s day
the most important political
force was the AFL-CIO.
Today it is the Christian
Coalition, the political arm of
the Reverend Pat Robertson.
The election of the GOP
Congress of 1994 and the
installation of Newt Gingrich
as Speaker of the House
marked an enormous power
shift within the Republican
party. The new leadership is
exclusively southern: Gingrich
is from Georgia, and Majority

Michael
Berquist

Leader Richard Armey and
Majority Whip Tom DeLay
are from Texas, as is Ways and
Means Committee Chairman

._Bill Archer. Dole’s hand-

picked Senate majority whip,
moderate Alan Simpson of
Wyoming, lost the caucus
election for the position to
Senator Trent Lott of

Mississippi, a very conserva- '

tive southerner. Dole is the
sole member . of the
Republican leadership from
the Midwest, once a GOP
stronghold.

In addition to the regional
difference between the old and
new GOP, there is the philo-
sophical difference. Gingrich
and his followers are disciples
of supply-side economics.
Dole was once the main GOP
critic of supply-side econom-
ics. During the 1982 tax battle
Dole joked: “Good news is a

bus full of supply siders went

over a hill last night  Bad
news is, there were three
empty seats.” This led
Gingrich himself to brand
Dole the “tax collector of the
welfare state.” Now with sup-
ply-side economics, the stan-
dard economic orthodoxy of
the Republican party, Dole has
seen which way the wind is
blowing and has decided to
change teams.

It is sad watching Dole, once
the sane voice of reason within
the GOP, pander to voters on
the right. In his quest to appeal
to these voters, Dole has jetti-
soned his moderate views on
social affairs and has adopted
a hard-line right-wing stance.
Earlier this year he gave a
speech in Hollywood that
showcased his new positions
on social issues. In his speech
Dole criticized Hollywood for
its ultraviolent movies and rap
ly.rics. The senator’s targets
were all politically motivated.
He made a special point of
attacking movies like Natural

  Dole waffles out of nomination

Born Killers. Is it a coinci-
dence that the movie’s direc-
tor, Oliver Stone, is a champi-
on of left-wing causes? I think
not. ,

Also, Dole failed to criticize
movies like Die Hard, The
Specialist and True Lies, all of
which are just as violent as
Natural Born Killers. Dole
speciﬁcally called True Lies a
family-friendly movie. Why?
Perhaps because the actors of
these movies, Bruce Willis,
Sylvester Stallone and Arnold
Schwarzenegger, are noted
Republicans. It’s odd that Dole
would praise a movie whose
hero sends his wife on a secret
mission as a prostitute and
which has orgies of violence
and language so foul that its
characters used four-letter
words like commas as being
family friendly.

In another attempt to pander
to voters on the right, Senator
Dole recently returned a con-
tribution made to his campaign

by the Log Cabin Republicans,
‘an organization of Republican

homosexuals. This decision
brought considerable opposi-
tion from the right wing, how-
ever, and the senator decided
to return the contribution and
admit that his original decision
had been a mistake. Once

Senator Dole had expressed in

an interview that anti-gay dis-
crimination was un-American.
His sudden decision shows
that the senator’s principals no
longer have any meaning.

Dole ought to step aside and
allow another candidate to
carry the Republican standard
in 1996. In his efforts to out-
flank neo-conservatives like
Phil Gramm and Malcom
Forbes, Senator Dole has
ignored his once cherished
principles. He ought to quit
before he does any more dam-
age to his reputation as an
intelligent and fair-minded
individual.

McClatchy

points Bucs
in right
direction

 

Columnist
Brad
Isles

_. 7* esterday, albeit so
_ brieﬂy, the sun shone
.. J upon the city of

Pittsburgh. The warmth felt
by its presence was a relief in
the midst of another frigid
winter day.

In my mind, I feel it was a
sign from all the former
Pirate greats, like Roberto
Clemente, Pie Traynor,
Honus Wagner and the Waner
brothers, showing their
approval of the beginning of
the Kevin McClatchy era in
Pittsburgh.

Shortly after 3:00 p.m.,
National League President
Len Coleman took the micro-
phone on the dias at the
Allegheny Club. Standing
before five World Series tro-
phies signifying the Pirates’
dominance in the ‘70s, he
announced that the current
owners of Major League
franchises voted unanimously
for McClatchy to take over

_/I the financially-risky Pirates

—-— just three days before the
spring training which kicks
off their 110th season.

With the vote, McClatchy,
who’s just 33 years old,
becomes the majors’
youngest owner and must
answer a plethora of ques-
tions all Bucco fans are dying
to know. The biggest ones
lead back to how the team

will capture the magic of the A

early ’90s championship era.

Now that his eight-month
trek through financial and
legal loopholes is finally
complete, what will it take
for McClatchy to make the
Pirates a contender again?

‘The first thing baseball’s
best manager, Jim Leyland,
did when he took the micro-
phone was to give McClatchy
a “gift.” It was a list of all
players who can become free
agents after the ‘96 season.

“We might as well get our
feet wet right away,” Leyland
said.

Leyland has the right idea.
The only way for the Bucs to
become contenders by the
year 2000 is to sign a few
high-profile free agents. I’m

Pitt loses to Big East patsy, Notre Dame

By Mike Kovak
Asst. Spam Editor

The Pitt Panther men’s basketball team
continued its downward spiral, this time
plummeting to new depths in a 77-69 loss to
Big East doormat Notre Dame last I
night at South Bend.

The loss is Pitt’s ninth in 10
games and drops its record to 9-12
(4-9). Pitt has not won a conference
road game this season.

‘This is the ﬁrst team I’ve been
involved with that hasn’t improved
over the course of the season,”
Head Coach Ralph Willard said. I
“In fact, we’ve gotten worse.”

Pitt’s offense continued to strug- ; '
gle, shooting 31 percent in the sec- .
0nd half and blowing several s
layups and open jump shots.

Foul shooting wasn’t the answer V ’
to Pitt’s problems. The Panthers
shot 53 percent from the line.

Shooting the basketball was only , _
the beginning of Pitt’s woes. 
Holding onto the ball seemed diffi- 7'
cult as well. The Panthers turned '
the ball over 19 times.

“We did not make good deci—  " ‘ ‘
sions with the basketball,” Willard —
said. “But our post people didn’t  1
make themselves open, and when ‘
they were, our guards threw the
ball away.” - ».

The lack of physical inside play . -
also hurt Pitt.

According to Willard, Pitt was
completely manhandled physically. '
The Fighting Irish outrebounded
Pitt by 11- and banged inside for 43
foul shot attempts.

As tragic as the final results
were, the way Pitt opened up the
game would have made many a

The annual day of reckoning came
last week for college football teams
across the country. High school players
began signing letters of intent last
Wednesday. A total of 23 players have
signed to play for Pitt next fall.

Head Coach John Majors prefaced his
assessment of the recruiting class of
1996 by acknowledging that every

‘coach has great expectations for young
talent. Majors is no exception.

“I think without question this is con-
siderably the best recruiting year that
we’ve had in the four years since we’ve
returned to the University of
Pittsburgh,” Majors said.

Regional loyalty played an important
role in bringing many of the recruits to
Pitt. Nine of them played their high
school football in western Pennsylvania.

“We, as a staff, have made a strong
effort in letting the coaches in this area
and the people in this area and the
young men from grade school through
high school know how important they
are to the University of Pittsburgh,”
Majors said.

This year, "those young men are partic-
ularly important to the University of
Pittsburgh’s offensive and defensive
lines. q

“We improved ourselves as far as
offensive and defensive line prospects,
number one because of western
Pennsylvania,” Majors said.

Six of the recruits. are Western

man marvel.
Pitt opened up an early 7-2 lead after

Garrick Thomas drained a 3-pointer. He

leads the Big East in 3-point shooting, hit-

ting at a 55 percent clip.

Forward Chad Varga hit two straight 3-

I5

Pennsylvanian linemen and/or lineback-
ers. -

Most of the rest are skill—position

players and flat-out fast guys, which

Football recruiting class

pointers to give Pitt a 21-12 lead with 11:47
left in the first half. Varga had 12 of the 21
points.

He finished the game with 15 points, 14
coming in the first half.

“Chad seemed to wear down in the second ‘

half,” Willard said. “He’s our

only offensive presence inside.”

_Just when things were going
the Panthers’ way, they began

 fouling the Fighting Irish. Notre

Dame enjoyed a 38-35 halftime

lead by converting 15 of 20

foul shots and finishing the

stanza with a 9-1 run.

 Pitt missed all three foul shot

" attempts in the first half.

However, Pitt had one match
left that almost started a sec-
 ond-half bonﬁre.

VVith 10:52 remaining in the
game, center Maik Blount was
 on the line for two shots. After
draining both, Blount, who
_. scored 10 points_, trimmed Pitt’s
1 _ deﬁcit to 53-52.

’  A gust of wind quickly blew
the match out.

Notre Dame opened up the
game with a 14-4 run that put it
ahead, 67-57, with 4:03 remain-
ing.

Pitt had several chances to
. make things interesting but
continually missed one inside
shot after another.

“We haven’t had the attitude
in practice to win games at
1 crunchtime,” Willard said.

Pitt’s attitude will need a seri-
ous adjustment this Saturday
when the fourth-ranked
Villanova Wildcats come to
Fitzgerald Field House for a
noon game.

‘best’ in four years

handful of the recruits were high school
track champions, and 10 of the 23 have
been clocked at 4.6 seconds or less in
the 40-yard dash.

Recruits

°From page 7
The most heavily recruited
position was running back,
an area where the Panthers
were decimated by injuries
last season. Five running

‘ backs signed for Pitt, as well

as nine other backs and
receivers.

Improving depth was
important, but the key for
Pitt will be quality, not quan-
tity.

“We lost a few good play-
ers, but the best talent on this
squad will be juniors, sopho-
mores and freshmen in the
upcoming year. Not knock-
ing our seniors, we don’t
have very many seniors,”
Majors said. “We’re not huge

quality.” »

That situation means that
many of the new recruits
may see playing time next
season. While Majors tried to
keep expectations for the
freshmen reasonable, he
acknowledged, without sin-
gling any of them out, that as
a group, the freshmen may
have to contribute.

“We’re going to give them
an opportunity because
there’s _an opportunity out
there,” Majors said. “I have
hopes that some of them will
help, but I’m not going to be
expecting them to be a big
factor in the first year. There
are some people we think
can help us in the first year.

man Charlie Hayes and cen-
terﬁelder Mike Kingery,
whom the Pirates signed over
the offseason. They may be
enough to help the Bucs get
back to .500, but that’s only if
Jeff King, Orlando Merced
and Jay Bell have career
years.

If the Pirates could’ve
signed a Darren Lewis, a
Lance Johnson, a Ben
McDonald or a Roberto
Alomar,‘the team’s talent level
would’ve multiplied tenfold.
But, with the franchise’s
future up in the air, these play-
ers were out of reach. Now
with McClatchy, they’re not. ‘

The Pirates must be active
in the next off-season, much
like Baltimore and St. Louis
were this year. Because,
although the Pirates have the
seventh-best minor league sys-
tem in baseball, that will not
be enough. What percentage
of minor leaguers actually
make it to the show?

McClatchy must field a con-
tender within the next few
years, because why will peo-
ple attend the games of a
mediocre team?

He knows his new team
must appeal to the fans.
McClatchy announced the
addition of 72 seats behind
home plate, much like those in
Houston’s Astrodome.

This allows the Astros to
show off former President

» George Bush visibly sitting in ~

the seats behind the plate
while being waited on by bow
tie-clad servers. What former
president could the Pirates
show off? Maybe the one from
Wholey Fish Co.

And why add new seats
when there are over 30,000
empty for every game?

McClatchy said he doubled
the budget for the tearn’s mar-
keting department. "This
includes the addition of a new
barbecue area outside the sta-
dium. And there will be fire-
works after every home win
and homerun. Kind of reminds
you of the Atlanta Braves,
doesn’t it? They won the
World Series last year. _

The fans don’t care what’s
going on around them during
the game or after. They care
about what's going on
between the white lines.
Spend the money on players,
not hot dogs or ribs.

Although the sale of the
Pirates to McClatchy is no
doubt a great move for base-
ball and the city of Pittsburgh,
the process of making the
Pirates sellable to the fans will
take some time, but making
them a contender 'won’t. If the
Pirates become a contender,
the fans will come. It’s called
the “Bandwagon.”

To do this, McClatchy just
needs to take some notes from
Orioles’ owner Peter Angelos’
new book — “How to Buy a
Contender.”
