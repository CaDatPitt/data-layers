New Pitt Computer

By LYNNE LACEY

Computers are being used
everywhere these days. In groc-
ery stores, they are used to check-
out groceries; in banks, they are
used to withdraw money; and in
business, they are used to analyze
marketing problems.

A new computer at Pitt is get-
; J,” ting on the bandwagon—it’s
diagnosing especially difficult

medical cases.

Dr. Jack Myers, a Pitt medical
professor, and Dr. Harry Pople,
associate professor of business,
use a VAX ll/780 computer
(nicknamed “Vaccine”) to tackle

\ a multitude of diagnostic prob-
lems related to internal medicine.

“Others have studied the
decision-making process using
computer-based models of intel-
ligent behavior in a variety of
fields,” Pople said. “We‘re the
first to use computers in internal
medicine.”

According to Myers, advances
in the medical profession, espe-
cially after World War II, have
bombarded doctors with too
many facts to remember.

“Mistakes are made in diagno-
sis because physicians are pushed

-.--s:~+*.-:.+:1>#¥9ns1'.th¢iwa.nacitv- I hene are

rare, complicated diseases with
too many components for many
doctors‘ to remember," Myers
said.

This computer’s data base will
serve as “a practical diagnostic
consultant” to physicians, Myers
said.

“lt will be used to diagnose
only 5 to 10 percent of the
illnesses physicians encounter,
such as complicated problems or
rare diseases,” he said.

Myers approached Pople 10
years ago with the idea of using
artificial intelligence in internal
medicine and Pople accepted,
though neither knew much about
the other’s field. ’

According to Pople, this
proved to be fortunate. “The
computer needs to take each step
logically, sequentially. By bring-
ing into the common knowledge
pool the basic elements of each
other’s specialty, we were able to
explain our areas to each other
and to the computer simultane-
ously,” he said. “It’s given each of
us a better insight into our ow'n
processes also.”

Firstvia-Satellite

By BRIAN BALK

Historywill be in the making from
9 p.m. to 5 a.m. today at Forbes
Quadrangle. Pitt, along with- 67
other major universities, will take
part in a first-ever telecommunica-
tions conference.

The conference, called “Produc-
tivity In America,” will concentrate
on the current economic slump and
the means to reverse this downward
trend. A _ _ ‘ ,

Dr. Richard Schonberger, profes-

sor of management at the University. ’

of Nebraska at Lincoln, helped to
organize this conference. “This
closed circuit broadcast will prob-
ably be a' growing trend in the
future,” he said.

The University of Nebraska and
the American University in
Washington D.C., will act as media-
tors for the conference. ‘They will
present programs and lectures
throughout the day in which partici-
pating universities can pose ques-
tions and provide feedback.

The conference, via-satellite, will
provide a number of advantages

\

over the traditional conference. It
will save the .. money and time
involved with travel. It will also
assemble experts from a designated
field, making them more accessible

because the satellite transcends geo- ‘

graphic areas. ‘

“I think Pittsburgh can benefit
from the conference,” Schonberger
said. “I think they will obtain a few
ideas which willbe useful."

Anyone can participate in the

conference, provided they pay the _
entrance fee of $125. However, it __

should appeal mostly to businesses,
industries and institutional manag-
ers concerned with increasing
productivity. . V

The conference will attempt to
give a general overview of-the prob-
lem of the current economic crisis. It
will also attempt to outline the steps
institutions can take to adjust to a
changing society. Programs in the
day’s agenda include:

productivity;

productivity;

Tackles Diagnostic Problems

Library of Medicine, is still in the
research and development stage.

Using artificial intelligence for
diagnosis -in internal medicine

 

has been attempted before, but
never on such an all-
encompassing scale. Although
only three-fourths of the more
than 800 diseases for which the
computer will be used have been
programmed into its medical
knowledge base, it is used to ana-
lyze experimental cases all the
time. ..

“It operates on a reasonable
level of expertness right now,”
Pople said. -

Programming diseases into
the medical knowledge base is
difficult, according to Pople,
because ofthe many components
involved. .

“Physicians can think of prob-
lems concurrently while the com-
puter must be programmed to
deal with multiple components
step—by-step, sequentially,” he
said.

‘ The ultimate determination of
which step the computer should
take and when was made by
Pople.

After conducting a psycholog-
ical analysis of the constituent
elements of Myers’ decision-
making process and program-
ming it into the computer, the
behavior of the program is ana-
lyzed and adjusted according to
Myers’ and other physicians’
criticisms.

The next stage is to engage the
project in a clinical trial to moni-
tor its effectiveness and accu-.
racy, “just as a new medicine is
tested,” Meyers said. ’

Once completed, the project,
called “Caduceus” in honor of
the staff and serpents that tradi- .
tionally represent -the medical .

profession, will be accessible to
both students and physicians.

“It’s an electronic text book,”
Myers said.

“But Caduceus is cross-
indexed, giving reference to both
the disease and its manifesta-
tions," Pople said.

Though their ideas are clear"
and their options reasonable,
Pople and Myers aren‘t sure
when their project will be ,
finished.

‘In science, until you’ve abso-
lutely proven something, you
really haven’t accomplished any-
thing,” Myers said.

The issue of civil rights is often one

I of great controversy. President Rea-
7 gan has been criticized for ignoring

the civil rights issue throughout his
term, and many people feel that
today's civil rights problem has not

subsided, but rather. worsened in

recent history.
The Reagan Administration's poli-

cies and decisions such as the one .

that instituted a holiday in honor of
Martin Luther King, Jr., have made
this a topic of particular interest.
Dr. Richard Blackett, of the black
studies department, said he has
strong reservations about Reagan.
“I think that Reagan and his Jus-

» tice Department have tried to under-

mine all previous civil rights gains,"
he said. "They have made efforts to
give tax exemptions to schools and

colleges that deliberately segregate."

Blackett said that the Reagan
Administration is not sympathetic to
poor people and the black commun-
ity in general. 6

When discussing the issue of civil
rights, historical factors need to be
considered, he said. Blackett said
that the rights blacks gained after the
Civil -War were systematically
destroyed in 1877 with the era of
Restruction.

"These historical antecedents
make Reagan particularly danger-

_ ous," Blackett said. "America always

seems to have a short historical
memory; it seems to forget what it

~ has done in the past"

Political science professor Michael S
Johnston said the issue of civil rights

may be partially due to the public
outlook as well as the poor distribu-
tion of wealth. ‘

He said the public has an obliga-
tion to pursue civil rights.

"The public's civic obligation is
now non-existent,” Johnston said. "A
good citizen's only obligation is to
worry about himself." ‘

‘A lot of today's problems with civil
rights are being directly blamed on
Reagan, but he is not the only culprit,
Johnston said. The civil rights prob-
lem goes as far back as Presidents
Nixon and Ford. ‘

"Any civil rights program depends
on a growing society andjobs; wealth
should be distributed differently
rather than to the same old people,"
he said. "Growth is necessary to the
program, - and it's just not
happening.” A’

The executive director of the
American Civil Liberties Union,
James Lieber, said the problem with
civil rights vary from general civil ser-

vants t.o Reagan's justice
department.

One problem, he said, is people
such as police ofﬁcers and prison
guards who abridge civil rights.

Another, bigger problem is the
Justice Department because it
"refuses to enforce civil rights as is
seen on the issue of desegregation
and ‘violations of voting rights,"
Lieber said.

Lieber sees the expanded power of
the Central Intelligence Agency in
domestic affairs making civil rights
infringements more secretive.

"All in all, it's not a great time for
civil rights, " he said.

Richard Bryers, a legislative assis-
tant to Sen. John Heinz, is more posi-
tive in his outlook on civil rights. He
doesn't deny the problems involved
in today's civil rights issues, but he
doesn't supply any solutions either.

Civil Rights: Progressing or Regressing in the (I . Se. ?

Bryers said, "The commitment (to
civil rights) is still there. Sen. Heinz is
very active on civil rights issues. He is

. the third overall in the Senate for the
Republican voting record regarding —

civil rights." -

Bryers added that the public is '

often misinformed about the gains
made-in civil rights. -

"People don't always-hear of the “

progress that is being made and the
press and the economy are not
always helpful," he said. -

The -term civil rights is usually
associted with blacks, but women,
the elderly and the handicapped are
affected also. ‘

"There are a lot of positive things
to be said about civil rights and a lot
more to be done," Bryers said. "It's
the job of senators and congress-
men to maintain progress and to
keep working until everyone's civil
rights are assured."

   Doing Things

Right

“They never notice when we do things right,” a
White House official recently complained in an inter-
view, but he neglected to acknowledge how little the
Reagan Administration has been doing right.

President Ronald Reagan’s State of the Union
Address had a little something for everyone, and edu-
cation and education-related problems received some

I badly needed recognition.

Reagan told Americans that he is seeking four
major education goals in 1983. Some of the aims, such
as permitting voluntary school prayer, are more con-
troversial than others, but the admirable goal he has in
mind is to set higher educational standards. Reagan
has taken the initiative to encourage the upgrading of
math and science instruction.

_ In addition, Reagan wants to establish accounts
that will provide low-and middle-income families with
an incentive to save and someday send their children to
college—a very different stand than his “government
out of private lives” cries heard in the past.

The problem with “revitalizing American education
by setting a standard of excellence” is that this admin-
istration’s priorities are narrow and driven, as Reagan
put it, by the need to keep the edge that we have.

Concerns about education are finally ﬁnding their
way back into the presidential agenda, unfortunately
due to Japanese gains and competition.

America is a technological leader in most fields, and
the goals -that Reagan has proposed are intended to
ensure that America remains a leader. The emphasis is
on an education that will enable more students to

develop an interest and talent for math and science at .

an earlier age, but nothing has been said about studies
in the liberal arts.

In view of the many cuts imposed on the sector of
arts and humanities by this administration, there isn't
much more that can be cut without disastrous
consequences.

If the Reagan Administration is truly interested in
the quality of education, it will not continue to be so
"biased toward math and science, but will show concern
for all disciplines. It is admirable that Reagan recog-

nized the need to upgrade education, butthis recogni- -

tion should be the beginning of a-long examination of
the education system—and not the demise of the well-
rounded education.

George Washington’s
Advice And The Mid East

By SCOTT REX

George Washington in his Fare-
well Address advised our country’
that, “The great rule of conduct for
us, in regard to foreign nations, is, in
extending our commercial relations,
and to have with them as little politi-

I

cal connectionas possible.” ‘

On Dec. 22, 1982, Congress failed
to follow the advice of our first presi-
dent. By overriding the objections of
President Ronald Reagan, Congress
passed a resolution granting $2.5 bil-
lion to the state of Israel. While
unemployment in our own country
is reaching new highs, Congress
voted more money per capita to the
citizens of Israel than they voted for
many of our fellow citizens.

Both President Reagan and Presi-
dent Carter aimed at obtaining auto-
nomy for the Arabs living in the

,West Bank.eWhich was occupied by

Israel in 1967. The United Nations
Resolution 242 and the Camp David
agreements require that Israel with-
draw from -this occupied territory.
The Geneva Convention also specif-

» ically states that an occupying coun-

try is prohibited from establishing
settlements onoccupied territories.

The state of Israel signedthe Gen-
eva Convention accords and the
Camp-David agreements. But by
rapidly settling in the West Bank,
Israel has violated the treaties it
signed. ’ I I

Thirty-six Jewish organizations in
the United States have made it clear
that they oppose the key elements of
President Reagan’s Mideast peace

initiative, which calls for a freeze on ,

Rights. However, when the com-
bined lobbying efforts of these
groups is so powerful that the efforts
to seek stability in the Mid East are
affected, Congress needs to recall

the wise advice of George

Washington. ~

At this university we, myself
included, are also guilty of allowing’
powerful interest groups, as well as
friends, to inﬂuence our opinions. If
an individual writes about Israel, he
is automatically called anti-Semitic.

 Why is this the case? Can’t we dis-
cuss this like rational human beings?

Look at how liberals in the United
States treat the subject of the Israeli
incursion into Lebanon——they treat
it like the plague. It is much easier to

talk about the United States in Cen- 

tral America. Well, compared to
what we give Israel every year, the
amount of aid going to Hondoras
and El Salvador is a drop in the
bucket.

I, just don’t think it is very healthy
’ for our country to ignore Israel‘s set-
tlement of the West Bank. Why
should President Reagan waste his
time discussing Israel's withdraw!
from this area? If he’s realistic, -Rea-
gan should realize that Israel has dif-
ferent ideas concerning the future of

Why does Congress vote to give
Israel $250 million more than the
President advised? Is it because they
are our allies who we can trust to let
us know their true intentions? If that
is the case, then that was some
“twenty-five mile” trip that Israeli
tanks went on last summer.

Firings Evoke Deep Concern

Dear Editor:

The recent suspensions and firings
of several employees of the Pitt
Book Center have justifiably evoked
deep concern in the university com-
munity and in the public.

If, as the individuals affected
believe, they have suffered these
penalties because they were exercis-
ing their right to organize a union
and petition for a collective bargain-
ing election, the university’s admin-
istration has acted in a manner that
is not only unwarranted, but. iilegal.

The employees are pursuing their
case through the university’: inter-
nal grievance procedures, and they
_havc filed with the state Labor Rela-
tions Board charges that the admin-

- istration has committed unfair labor .

practices. _
Representatives of the Book Cen-

ter management and the ‘Office of
Human Resources with whom we

have spoken have insisted that the

actions taken were “for cause” and
were completely unrelated to the
individuals‘ organizing activities.
But they declined to comment on the
nature of the specific grounds for
dismissal, citing standard university
policy designed to protect individual

. grievants. This policy has the corol-

llary effect, it should be noted, of
protecting administrators from the
?need to explain and justify their
actions publicly.

' For the sake not only of the indi-

viduals directly affected but of the
entire university community——
faculty, staff,‘ students and
administrators—it is imperative that
the Labor Relations Board act
quickly to investigate the circum-
stances surrounding the suspensions

and ﬁrings and resolve the question

of unfair labor practices.

In the meantime, it,is incumbent
upon the administration to take pos-
itive action to improve its relations
with university employees. It is not
enough to assert intentions to

remain within the. letter of the law.
Unfortunately, the serious charges
leveled at the administration in this
case fit all too well a long-standing
pattern of “managerial" indifference
and hostility toward the assertion by
faculty and staff of legitimate needs,
grievances, and rights, including the
right to organize for collective
bargaining. ~

A climate of mutual suspicion, I

distrust and fear is incompatible

with the purposes and values'of a '

university. If the administration’s
talk about commitment to honor-

_ ing the laws, togcollegiality and to
, building trust is Lobe anything more

than empty words, Pitt's administra-
tors must makeedrastic changes in
their habitual posture of hostility to
efforts of faculty and staff to organ-
ize in defense of their interests and

rights. ’

Airbands Contest,NotUseIess

on airbands, I often wondered
what kind of person withholds

 his name from a letter. After

reading the letter, I realize I also
would not have had the guts to

‘put my name to that piece of

trash.

Mr. (or Msgif that is the case)
Name Withheld points out that
airbands are a useless activity.
Sorry, but I think that any activ-
ity that gets students involved

By CHRISTOPHER APPLEGATE
V Bingo O’Malley is one of the most
brilliant actors in Pittsburgh. A sim-
ple statement of fact. He is rivalled
only by the equally brilliant, but very
different, Alexander (formerly
Michael) Cook. Anyone who has any
doubts about the above statement
can dispel them in one evening by.
visiting the Pittsburgh Laboratory
Theatre to see O’Malley in the title
role of The Man in the Glass Booth.
Written by British actor Robert
Shaw (whose. roles ranged from the

I gentle Aston in The Caretaker to the

cold-blooded SMERSH assassin in
From Russia With Love), Glass Booth pla-
ces enormous demands on its central
character. This is the complex_and
Goldman,» an
enormously wealthyjewish financier
who chooses to stand trial posing'as_
Adolf Karl Dorff, a Nazi mass mur-.
derer._ Originally performed by
Donald Pleasance, the role is a
thrown gauntlet to any -actor with
the courage to attempt it. O’Malley is
more than equal to the challenge.
O’Malley is an incredibly organic
actorf A Rich Little or a_ Frank Gor-
shin could never do an impression of
him. Like Spencer Tracy, O’Malley
shapes his whole physical being-
body carriage, gesture, walk, facial
manipulation—to the character he is A
portraying. ‘I-_Iis emotional resonance
is simply uncanny. When he

' momentarily becomes enraged with

an aide, for example, his face flushes
beet red and the veins pop out of his
neck. And then, Proteus-like, the
moment is gone. As something of a
schizophrenic, Goldman is, in many
two characters. O’Malley
wearshis SS Colonel's uniform with’
swaggering pride and Prussian mil-
itary bearing. When his true identity
is revealed and he breaks down emo-
tionally, he becomes as fluidly Jewish

. as Tevye in Fiddler.On The Roof. It is a
' stunning performance. A

O’Malley’s performance has been
well guided by -the firm, sure hand of
director Bill Royston and has the sup-
port of a generally good cast. Robert

, Stoll creates a very real and touching

Charlie Cohn, Goldman's yes—man in
business‘ and the only one -to leap to
his defense when he stands trial in
Israel as ‘Colonel Dorff. Excellent
character work is rendered by G.W._
Rooney and Bob Wenzel as concen-
tration camp victims and Jack Price
does quite a good job with the role of
the Israeli trial judge.

Although a few actors seem a bit
young and inexperienced in minor
roles, the only real flaw in the acting
is the performance of Cathy Murphy
Rakow as the prosecutor, Rosie
Rosen. Rakow is flat and uninterest-
ing and given to mu,<*-<:ing and shrill
yelling as a substit: for genuine
emotion.

Shaw's script is not an easy one to
describe and deals with the questions

.With the myriad of plays written
over the centuries. to choose from, I
question why director Robert
Tomaszewski picked the version of A
View from the Bridge being presented
through tomorrow night at the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh Studio Theatre.
About this original version of a his
play, Arthur Miller wrote, ”It was a
-hard, telegraphic, unadorned drama.”
He rewrote it, creating_a two-act play

i he felt was ”more human, warmer

and less remote, but also a clearer
statement.” \ I

-1 was more moved in reading the
two-.act version than in seeing this
particular presentation of the one-act

play.

In both there is a narrator who:
serves the samefunction as the cho— ’

rus in Greek tragedies, adding color

and moving the tale along between

scenes. I don't know if it was the
script choice or the acting of Karl

Rogers as Mr. Alfieri (narrator/law- '

yer) that made me want to scream,
”get on with it already!"

Philip John Winters played a credi-
ble Eddie~Carbone, the central char-
acter of the play whose self-destruc-
tion is brought about by his jealous
love for his niece Catherine ‘(played
with enthusiasm by Lisa Dobler).

Probably the most consistent per-
formance of the evening was done by
Dawn A. Lewis as Beatrice, Eddie's

the script choice because in this ver-
sion Beatrice is pretty much of a
patsy, whereas the two-act script was
created mostly to include her view-
point, thus a much more interesting
character and play. I

,_ the twin millstones of Poritz’ script

leman Poritz’ radical innovtion in pol-
itical comedy—humorlessness. Set in
the White House and featuring a plot
about tomatoes, ghosts and political
incompetence, Poritz’ satire has all “

have much of a chance considering
the rampant incompetence evident in
its production.

The acting is, with few exceptions,
simply appalling. Martin Giles as
President Lackluster turns in a per-
formance in keeping with his charac-
ter’s name. In addition, he adds the
novel touch‘ of clogging his pores
with $4.00 worth of pancake makeup
and penciling lines on his face. This
creates the effect of a man who has

subsequently decided that it would be
a swell idea if he penciled lines on his
face. Lyn Super, as the president's
daughter, Lela, gives a fine rendering
of a woman reading unfamiliar mate- 7
rial from cue cards, Donovan Johnson
is a wooden caricature as a presiden-
tial aide. And the list goes on.

Neal Hemphill, Lance Skapura and
Frances Malarkey display some famil-
iarity with the art of acting, but their
work is impossible to evaluate given

andvlim Schneider's directing about
their necks.

By I-‘RANK DIGIACOMO

Sir Richard Attenborough doesnot

In fact, save for his Tory accent, his
outward demeanor is not that of the
British stereotype: he smiles much
more and does not hide behind that
prim and proper facade of English
stoicism. No, Attenborough comes
off more like someone’s grandfather
with his thinning, silver hair, huge

ing glasses and genuine toothy grin
that would put even the biggest sour-
puss in a good mood. You half expect
him to offer you a roll of Lifesavers
and a great big bear hug.

/ Only don't be. fooled. ’While his
hightly accessible Congeniality is by
no meansga front, Attenborough has
a lot more to offer than "a roll of‘ Pep-

eyes of his, there operates a genius of
creativity. His is not the mind of a
60-year-old grandpa, but of ahighly
seasoned director and actor who has
captured the futility of war and now,

of film. _ _
Attenborou-gh’s list of accomplish-

recognizable achievements include
costarring with Steve McQueen in
The Great Escape and with James Ste-
wart in Flight of The Phoenix. He has also
captured two Golden'Globe awards
for his performances in Dr. ‘Dolittle
and The Sand Pebbles. That is not all.
Attenborough made his ‘directorial
debut with Oh! What A Lovely War, a
razor-sharp comment.on thejuseless-
ness-of war and its resultant slaugh-.
ter of a whole generation of young
men. Heralded as a brillant debu-t for
a director, the film went on to capture
16 international awards, including
another Golden Globe. ‘ ‘
From there, he went on to star in
10 Rillington Place, a stark portrayal of
John Reginald Christie, the notorious
mass murderer and necrophiliac. He
then furthered his directing career
with Young Winston, A Bridge Too Far
and, in 1978, Magic.

However, throughout much of his
illustrious career, Sir Richard has had
something else on his mind besides
these aforementioned projects. In
1962, he was presented with a bio-
graphy of Mahatma Gandhi that so

to make a film about this "nut-brown
man in .a.loincloth.” Nonetheless , it
was easier said than done. No studio
was interested in backing him finan-
cially for a film project on Gandhi.
"They all laughed and said, ‘Who the
hell wants to see a film about a little
brown man dressed in a sheet and
carrying a bean pole?’ ” he says.
Nevertheless, ignoring rejection,
Attenborough set out independently
to- make this film. Six times he
attempted to get the project off the
ground, often taking on directing and
acting ‘bits in other films to ‘raise
funds for the Gandhi movie, and six
times he failed—often in bankruptcy.

Yet something persisted in Atten-
borough, and he carried the spark of
this idea for close to 20 years. He
attributes his doggedness to the
alternatives that the Mahatma’s phi-
losophy and life work offered to a
world that saw violence as a final

from private investors, hired John V
9 Briley to write a screenplay," and had

found a remarkable English actor,
Ben Kingsley, to play the role of the
Indian leader,,His journey was almost
over.  _ J
One of the final obstacles Sir
Richard had to overcome was a bit of
controversy that originated in Gand-
hi’s mother country of India. It seems
that various areas of the media and
many Gandhian scholars were
opposed to the..Mahatma’s life being
depicted on the movie screen. One
female pupil insisted that ‘Gandhi
cou_ld only be shown as a moving
speck of light. ”I’m not," responded
Attenborough, ”making a film about
bloody Tinker Bell!" The issue was
finally resolved by Pandit Nehru who
insisted that Gandhi‘ not be deified.
Sir Richard immediately agreed. I

"They all. laughed and said, ‘Who

solution. ”I'm an agnostic, a radical
and a socialist. I foughtin the last
war, but the thought of violence I
abhor. The concept of colonialism I
despise...to condone any form of
colonialism and certainly the subju-
gation of one nation by another in
terms of racial or religious prejudice
seems totally amoral," xhe emphas-
izes.- ”And suddenly, I came across

I this extraordinary little man who

spoke, as they say, to my ‘condition.’
He Verbalized and put into practice a
mass of what I found a great sym-
pathy for ...for centuries we have
accepted, as a last resort to the solv-
ing of our problems, the use of vio-
lence. All Gandhi was saying was,
’Does the world have to go on with
that attitude? Is this the best we-can
manage as human beings?’ " I

Armed with‘ this inspirational
ideology, Attenborough pressed on,
determined to make this film’ of

Thus, on Nov. 26, 1980, filming
began on the movie that has since
gone on to have its American pre-
miere in New York last Dec. 8,’ gar-
nering nothing but acclaim and
critical celebration. Two days before
this interview took place, Attenbo-
rough had been informed that he had
been awarded the 1983 Martin
Luther King Peace Prize for Gandhi.
This, coupled with his knowledge
that his movie is almost a shoo-in for
an Oscar nomination, thrills him to

‘no end. . 9' A
So, for Attenborough, the long

wait between the birth of an idea and
the culmination of his movie, has not
been in vain—perhaps for more than
one reason. He believes that the pres-
ent conditions are much betterthan

I they were in the '60s. ”I doubt the

movie would have come off as well in
the '60s because I had much less expe-

rience as a director. I also think that‘

such—it\might have been thought to

sored," he says and then smiles,
”besides, I never would have had
Ben.”. -

Of course, he will tell you, Gandhi‘
carries with it an overall message, but
it is also a movie meant to entertain
and not simply to serve ‘as a soapbox
for Sir Richard to stand on. In his
opinion, that is beyond the capacities
of commercial film. ”I think one of the
dangers that one can easily fall into, is
to make assumptions, in relation to
cinema, which are really beyond it s
capabilities. If you decide -that you
want to tell a story about Gandhi, and
you say...’my judgment tells me that I
must show 55 years of his life in a‘
period of three hours,’ there is no
way one can do more than just stimu-
late, to the minutest degree, an inter-
est in Gandhi, India, peace,
nonviolence or whatever,” he says.
”If you attempt to go into depth on a
particular strand of that, the chances
are you will not find an audience
because it is too erudite, too academic
and would require too much precise
examination and consideration to.‘

.. warrant its evidence in a V—ma_ssf"

medium such as cinema.” -

He goes on to clarify his —point:_’:
” Gandhi .is not a philosophical, political
diatribe—it is not, in any sense, a
piece of erudition. If you were work-
ing in commercial cinema and you
wanted to reach thehvast number of.
people with what you want to__ say,
you must couch it in entertainment
terms,” he explains. ”It is the differ.-"
ence" between objective and subjec-I.

affected. I want the suspension of dis‘-5
belief to occur during those three:

"hours. I want the audience to cry; to]

five lads—very young and very

caught the world ablaze with a

Musical Youth’s ”PassiThe

- Dutchie,” (a dutchie is.a Jamai-

can cooking pot) hasrbecome a
worldwide phenomenon after
hitting the British charts like a
sneak attack on a small South
American island.

Not since Gary, Indiana, fed

us the Jackson Five has this"

country been so open to what
pre-teen music was dishing out.
Certainly reggae artists in the
past have had more to offer as
an introduction to the genre,
but it's taken this cuddly and
seemingly harmless package,
crowned by singer/guitarist
Kelvin Grant's cherubic 11
year-old grin, to welcome reg-

_ gae into the mainstream.

So powerful is the attraction
to this band that even MTV had
to erase the color line previously
drawn for black artists and
allow the ”Dutchie” to pass.

Musical Youth formed out of
a community workshop in their
native Birmingham that
encourages young people to
pick up the sticks and bang on
the keys. Ideas "such as this only

‘Youth offers more than sus-

tained optimism backed by an
unrelenting dance beat. These
chaps balance their spright, fes-
tive sound with a biting, how-
ever simplistic, commentary on‘
the socio-economic and political

Youth Of Today, while not a
very diverse introduction to the
reggae genre, is much more
than a 12-inch excuse for the hit
single. The hooks that can be
heard dripping off ”Dutchies"
pop up again and again, as do the
brittle organ lines and little Kel-

vin’s ”Biddlie, biddlie, bong”,

reggae rap. I
Singer Dennis Seaton, five

years older and a few octaves -

lower, puts across more tradi-
tional R&B fare in a style easily
likened to Michael Jackson. Kel-

follow-up to ”Pass The

vides a nice frame of reference
in which to place all the new
bands from across the sea, it

does little for someone who has

heard all these tricks before.
Beatitude sounds an awful lot
like The Cars, Candy-O, etc. What

that means is that in between ,

seething new approaches to the
pop music form, Ocasek litters
unsalvagable attempts at rock-
art/art-rock.

Beatitude's best, like the Car's
best, is a mix of layered key-
boards and power rock guitars
all tied together by Ocasek’s dis-
tant and quivering vocals.
"Something to Grab For” and_
"A Quick One" continue where
"My Best Friend's Girl” and
"]ust What I Needed" left off. ’'I
Can't Wait" presents a depar-
ture of sorts into the world of
Phil Spector/Brian Wilson, giv-
ing that over-produced, multi-
sound the twist of today's
instrumental technology.

Ocasek fails in his attempts to
capture the confused discontent
of America's youth in "Jimmy,
Jimmy" and "Take A Walk.” His

. pretensiously distorted vocals

sound like a drone with an
amphetamine problem.

" Hey Ric, it's only rock 'n' roll;
climb out of the sensory depri-
vation tank ' before you're all
wet.

Diamond Head
MCA

Diamond Head is a heavy
metal punch in the gut; they hit
yoii with the force of a tractor-
trailer _ and don't even blink.
This quartet hails from Eng-
land, but that doesn't make
them any better. The only thing
I have found that makes them
better is turning off the sound.

The songs are built around
slow drum lines with excellent
vocals by Sean Harris with
Brian Tatler's good guitar work
filling the voids. "Am I Evil" is a
super cut, and "Don't You Ever
Leave Me" has a high point (a
dual between bass and guitar),
however, the rest is garbage.
Harris ought to drop these tur-

_ keys and go to work for people

who can really write songs.
Diamond Head is living on
Borrowed Time; there is too much
good rock and roll out there to
waste time and money on crap

like this.

Dear Editor:

For the ' past five and one half

educational, informative and some-
times just plain funny. However, I

most promising and entertaining
characteristics. Showcase appeals to
the students in a way that no other
campus publication comes close to.

Dear Editor:
I see from Frank Digiacomo’s
recent record review that he doesn't

care for Toni Basil's Word of Mouth.

Well why should he? After all, it's
essentially a tepid collection of bland

synthopop. But how would the.

reader know this, as Digiacomo was
so busy slurring the singer and ﬂash-
ing his pointlessly vicious "style."
Maybe I'm just uninformed. Being
that Showcase has so little room for its
many informative and intelligent
reviews, ongoing policy must entail
cramming as many nasty (or ingra-
tiating) things about the music and
musicians in the small space alloted.
It's only appropriate that such a
negative review would appear in a
paper whose entire staff seems to
reflexively laud the most obscure,
though trendy music. But the

pseudo-Bohemian sentiment of Show-
case is. displayed by virtually every
column. Digiacomo’s recent review

so well typifies the forced antigé-..-2.

commercial-music attitude of thd
whole paper. It also strikes a nadir in
tastelessness. A

As much as Digiacomo’s thoughts
on Word of Mouth seem to mirror the
paper as a whole,’it is questionable
why such a "hip" (read: avante-garde)
publication, which extols the likes of
Oingo Boingo and Wall of Voodoo,
would even bother reviewing this
obviously Top-40 material. My guess
is that poison-penned Frank wrote. -.

that appears in the last paragraph.

By CHARLIE O'HARA »

Five members of the Panthe
track team will participate in two of
the finest meets in indoor track.

Friday night, Pitt travels to New
York City for the Millrose Games.
On Saturday, they head for Louis-
ville for the prestigious Mason-
Dixon Games.

The five Panthers making the trip
are Garland Brown, Terry Gal-
lagher, Todd Colas, Darren Geary

 and Roger Kingdom. Brown, Gal-

A gher, Colas and Geary will com-
pete in the 2-mile relay, and
Kingdom will run the 55-meter hur-
dles at both meets.

“The competition will be rough,”
Kingdom said. “Everybig name will
be there. I have to be mentally pre-
pared and cannot afford a mistake.”

“I'm going for the win and trying
to break 7 flat.” , i

_ If he intends to win, Kingdom will
most likely have to break seven
seconds; former UCLA star Greg
Foster, l982 NCAA runner-up Wil-
lie Gault and 1972 Gold Medalist
Rod Milborn are all accustomed to
this sort of time.

_ Head coach John Vasvary

wiliaelieves that Kingdom can run with

anybody in the country. .

“Roger will be running against the
best and will have to be ready,” he
said. “He proved that he is capable
at the Eastman Kodak Meet, but
had the misfortune of false starting
in the finals.”

The Panther 2-mile relay team is
capable of winning, but can’t afford

« any mistakes. . .

On Friday night at the Millrose
games, the team will face Villanova,
who was last years national runner-
up and collegiate record holder,
third-ranked Georgetown, fourth-
ranked Richmond, Rice, Virginia,
Farleigh Dickerson and Canada’s

- fﬂpritish Columbia University.

&'

- On Saturday they will compete

against a smaller but no less talented
ﬁeld: the Chicago Track Club,Con-

cerned Athletes (an_ organization _
' . ;much like any track club except it
provides some. charity» work),Ten-V

nessee and British Columbia.

Th‘ " hashe-P h‘ it .

._ team's missing link.

on their toes and ready forall,
possibilities. ~

“They. have to be prepared for
anything and everything. Every.

team has proven capabilities and

will not fold under pressure,” Vas- -

vary said.

This Panther team has many goals
set, and so should also be ready to
withstand pressure.

“We want to win at Millrose
Games for all that it represents. At

, Mason-Dixon, we're shooting for

 t T be American record,” junior Todd
- Colas said.

 

Becoming a team with conﬁdence
has taken quite a bit of togetherness
and determination. The Panthers
have pieced things together. i

“We seem to have the perfect
lineup. Garland is a great lead-off
because he has the speed to go with
any one and the quickness to adjust
to the openings given throughout his
leg," Vasvary said. “Terry is a fighter
who makes holes when often times
there appear to be none. Todd has
the ability to break a race wide open
and is just as hard a runner as is

vailable. Darren is the anchorman;
he can kick with the kickers if need
be. Having been an All-America, he
has the experience and intelligence
that the anchorman needs.

“They complement each other
very well. They have great team

3 desire and will be very difficult to
_ luhea! "

Panthers Racing To Millrose, Dixon Games

Pitt’s two-mlle relay team (L, to R) Darren Geary, Todd Colas, Terry Gallagher and

Garland Brown.

By TODD ERKEL

The Panther basketball ‘ team
hosts Providence tomorrow at the
Fitzgerald Field House at 8 p.m.
With little more than a third of its
Big East schedule behind them, it's
learned why the Big East is often
called the nation’s toughest
conference.

Ask sophomore center « Andre

8 Williams who’s been hobbled all sea-

son with knee and foot problems.
Williams fouled out of the Panther’s
68-63 loss at Boston College in

‘ which he had to battle the Eagles

twin-tower front line of 6-9 Jay
Murphy and 6-8 John Garris.
“The Big East has been tougher on‘
Andre than on any other player on
the ballclub," Roy Chipman said.
‘‘It’s taken its toll, not only physi-

cally but psychologically.” *

Williams spent this week getting
treatments, hoping to relieve some
of thepain and discomfort caused by
his tendonitis. If Williams is not
'-available, Chipman will turn to

’fresh'man Keith» Armstrong, who's

‘no more than -steady and at least a

The strain of the l6-game Big East

schedule surfaced, according to___.t

Chipman, in the closing minutes
Tuesday» at Boston College. The
Panthers-reached for, but couldn‘t

‘ find, that little extra needed to, in

Chipman’s words, “get over the’
hump” of a strong second half
comeback.

Looking to tomorrow and
beyond, Chipman sees only more
talented, and sometimes awesome,
basketball teams ahead.

Even Providence, whose 9-10
overall and 2-5 Big East record is
deceiving, can be trouble despite all
the problems their coach, Joe Mul-
laney, claims they’re having. The
Friars had Big East powers George-
town and St. Johns by their national
rankings only to let go and lose, both
in close contests.

Mullaney took advantage of yes-
terday's press luncheon to cry a little
ditty of Big East blues but Roy Chip-
man didn’t get too misty-eyed.

“I can’t feel sorry for them,” Chip-

man said. “At least he’s getting scor-'

ing out of two players. We're just
getting out of one——Clyde.."

Providence is led by 6-9 junior -

center Otis Thorpe, seventh in the

conference in scoring, averaging 18 - ‘
points per game, and fouth in’

rebounding, pulling down 8.5
boards per game. Thorpe is shooting
an impressive 68 percent from the
floor-—tops i-n the league.

i['_l'he Friar's leading scorer, 6-5

,se'nior Ron Jackson, stands fouth in

the conference scoring race with a '
' l9.5 points-per-game average. Chip-

man described Jackson as having a
deeper range than league leader

Vaughan, which isa polite way of
saying, he only shoots when he has
the ball. ‘

The ability of Pitt’s backcourt to
bounce back from a cold shooting
performance Tuesday and redis-
cover the basket is the key, accord-
ing to Chipman.

“The game will come down to
whether we get shooting from our
guards,” Chipman said. “The key
won't be Clyde...we’ve won the
games in which the other guys have
shot well.”

Shooting well will mean shooting
over the top of Providence’s 2-3
match-up zone—a Joe Mullaney
staple for over three decades.

Pitt finds itself at 8-8 overall, I-5

in the Big East heading into the heart .

of its schedule. Chipman believes his
team has developed a tougher men-
tal alertness after sharing the court
with the likes of Patrick Ewing, Leo
Rautins and Ed Pickney. '

“I'd like to play some of the teams

we lost to earlier inthe year,” Chip- .

man said. i

' With Providence ‘here tomorrow ,
and the number seven ranked“St'.

must be counting the likes of Navy‘?

Swimmers Sketch New Map

' By MARK A. 5|NDl.ER

High hopes can be dashed quite
rapidly. Fred Lewis, coach of the
Panther swim team, had his plans
mapped out at the start of the sea-
son, plans that called for nothing
less than a “0" under the loss
column.

The only problem is that Lewis
did not anticipate the meet against

_LaSalle last weekend. Even before

the final relay began, the Explorers
already held the Panthers in their
grasp. Although they lost the 400-
yard freestyle relay they beat the
Panthers 59-54.

With the loss in hand, there’s no
looking back and pondering what
could have been. Instead, Lewis is
slowly stepping into tomorrow’s
meet against West Virginia as if the
word “loss" were an unfamiliar

‘ .concent._

"This meet traditionally brings .

out the best of the team," Lewis said.
“Two minor mistakes cost us still
being undefeated.

“If we swim up to our potential

against WVU, we can pull it out.-

Our lineup will be the best‘ against
West Virginia, just as it was with
LaSalle."

West Virginia currently has a 6-0
record, including a big win over
Maryland and a second-place in the
Penn State relays.

“West Virginia has a lot ofquality
and depth,” Lewis said. “lt’s a good
combination of talent on a all-
around good team."

Diving coach Julian Krug antici-
pates the Panthers‘ competition
against West Virginia’s divers with a
certain degree of curiosity. Overall,
he said, the meet will once again be
intense.

“lt‘s going to be interesting,” Krug

said. “This is a traditional rivalry,
and as always, it’ll be tough."

The Mountaineers are countering
with junior Bill Treasurer and
sophomore Steve Grindal.

“Unless he hits his head on a
pole," Krug said of Treasurer, “he’s
the big odds-on favorite to win the
one-meter board. Grindal was the
state champ two years ago in the
high school finals."

Krug said that West Virginia
should be in front of Pitt because of
their collegiate experience, but
added that because of Grindal’s
scores and the points Pitt’s divers
have picked, both teams will be
“very_competitive."

“We have a good to slight chance
of knocking them off Saturday,”
Krug said. “We did an excellent job
last week, a good job especially with
just about an all-freshmen cast.”

Gallagher
Sees No
Shadows

By BARRY USLOFF

Terry Gallagher never observes
cows leaping the moon, nor does he
blink at the giant shadows that for
years have harbored by his side.
Pitt’s senior track star dispels their
existence like he does opposing
runners.

Right now, the cows cannot be
seen, but the shadows are still there
testing the wisdom of Gallagher,
who’ runs on Pitt’s two-mile relay
team, which earlier this season qual-
iﬁedfor the Millrose Games to be
held tonight at Madison ‘Square
Garden.

At Bishop McDevitt High
School, located just outside of Phil-
adelphia, the guy that burned holes
in his shoes was Darryl Bryant, the
nation’s second ‘best quarter-miler.
Gallagher’s shoes were hot, too, but
the fire extinguisher was reserved for
Bryant.

So while Bryant scorched a path
to the University of Maryland, Gal-
lagher crossed the state to Pitt,
where he, along with Todd Coals,
Darren Geary and Garland Brown,
is on the verge of gaining All-
America status for his part in the
two-mile relay.

Still, there may be a shadow
haunting Gallagher——-namely that of
Geary, who gained‘ All-America
recogition last year as a half-miler.
But Gallagher denies it. -

“Darren’s a good runner, but
there isn’t anyone around here that
can’t run with him,” Gallagher says.
“No one on our team would ever

consider himself in the shadow of '

another person. Our times show that

everybody’s about equal...that there _

are no superstars...no one stands
out: _
“There’s no animosity .among

team members,” Gallagher adds. -_
‘_‘_We all live in the same place and _
hang’ out together, Everyone gets __
along really well-—we‘ve always got- . ..
.-ten along well. Our personalities are 
..:all different, but they blendwwell _.

of becoming an Olympian. For Gal-

“Everybody thinks about it,” Gal-
lagher says, _“but it‘s just too much.

i It involves so much dedication that 

you have to plan for it from when
you're young. ~ ‘
“I'd like to make it to the Olympic

trials—that would be good enough 

for me.”

In order to accomplish this goal, ’ '
he has to run his leg of the two-mile‘ ‘T.
relayin 1:47. At the recent East~'Fen- - ,:

to set both school and meet records
with a time of 7:24.4.

He has to be considered an under- A

dog to reach the Olympic trials;

three seconds is an eternity to a half- .' .8

miler. This year is also his last, so his
chances are growing slimmer by the
day.

“l have to be realistic. I’m in my  ‘

to be prepared if it doesn’t work

_ The Pitt News, Friday Janaury 28, 71983 ,

Frank Rich of Pitt scored a take-
down and nearfall to take a 4-0 lead
in the first period over Kent State’s
Pete Delois. Rich gave up an escape
and takedown in the second period
to tighten the score at 4-3, and he
ended the period with an escape.

In the third period, it was all Pitt
as Rich hit .a Peterson roll for a re-
versal and nearfall, pulling out the
ll-3 major decision and puting the
Panthers back in the match.

At l90 lbs., Pitt’s Kurt Karano-
vich and Kent S'tate’s-Mark Kissel
battled to a 2-2 tie at the end of the
first period. Karanovich had the
lone score of the second period with

  ISU Won’t Be Routine

appears that this season it will be no
different. Aside from an upgrade in
the difficulty of routines, D’Amico
believes that a couple things have to
happen. 5

“We can probably beat them on
the floor exercise. We'have been
strong on the rings and vault and
will need a good performance
again.”

“The side horse is where we must
keep it close. If we are any more than
a point behind after the side horse
then it will be very difficult to catch
them. If we keep it under a point
then it could come down to the ﬁnal
ever'it——the high bar.”

A D’Amico also believes that the
home court advantage should help
his Panthers. .

With their record unblemished at
6-0, a victory over Indiana State
would probably put them in line for
Top 20 consideration, tl;,e._.t.eam hav-
ing previously defeated Illinois and
North Carolina State.

The Top 20.is something that the

an escape, putting the score at 3-2
going into the third period.

In the third period, Karanovich
pulled out a pair of nearfalls and
riding time to get the l0-2 major
decision. This put the Panthers
within two points and set the stage
for the evening’s finale.

At heavyweight, a stalling point
against Golden Flash Dwayne Hol-
loway gave Pitt’s Dan Kasperkoski a
first period l-O lead. An escape by
Holloway and stalling points against
both wrestlers tied the score at 2-2 in
the second period. Kasperkoski
made it three in a row for Pitt, hold-
ing Holloway scoreless while gain-
ing an escape, takedown, nearfall
and riding time to win l0-2, giving
Pitt the win.

Although the end of the match
was undeniably Pitt’s, the beginning
wasdominated by Kent State.

Rick Robust downed Pitt’s Kyle
Nellis 12-5 to open the evening at
HB lbs. Nellis opened the match
with a double-leg takedown to take a
2-0 lead in the first period. Nellis
escaped twice in the second period
but was taken down both times to
fall behind 5-4. In the third period,
Robust scored an escape, a take-
down and riding time for the 12-5
decision.

At I26 lbs., Kent State’s Dave
Amato made it two in a row by
downing Rich Esswien 7-5. The two
fought to a 2-2 first-period tie.

' Amato put the only points on the

board in the second period with a
reversal, going up 4-2. In the third
period, Amato scored a nearfall and
riding time to Esswien’s reversal to
end the match.

Panther captain Throckmorton
put Pitt on the scoreboard when he
eased past Marty Lucus 11-3 at 134
lbs. Throckmorton opened. the
match with a takedown and ended
the period with a nearfall for a 4-0
lead. Throckmorton opened the
second period witliran escape, but
was taken down to put the score at

Georgia Not For ‘Dogs

By SARA STRICKLAND

One might hear the familiar cries
of the 1982 Sugar Bowl—“How
’bout them Dogs!”—as the Lady
Panther gymnasts meet the Georgia
Bulldogs at two o’clock tomorrow at
Trees Hall.

This will be the first‘ year the Lady
Panthers have met‘ with Georgia.
Lady Bulldogs possess two elite level
gymnasts: Stacy Cook and Cathy
McMinn, the only ones competing
at the college level. Junior Karen
Martin believes this will be benefi-
cial in competing against Georgia.

“It will be a great experience for
us,” Martin said. “It will give us a
chance to match our skills against
some of the top-ranked gymnasts in
the country.” ’ ,

Although Georgia isn’t in Pitt’s
region, they will be an excellent
match for the Lady Panthers and
will help them prepare their skills for
regional meets during the season. -

“There are_ 89 Division I schools in
the country," Coach Donna Sanft
said, “33 of which are in our region.
We have the largest and toughest
region. This meet will be excellent
experience for the team. ,

' “It is not logical that in our region

7 out of 33 teams have the gag _t_g ,

qualify for regionals,” Sanft said,
“but in other regions, only 7 out of 8
teams have to qualify. Our region
stretches all the way from New

. Hampshire to Tennessee. However,

the committee is working on new
regional boundaries for next year.”

The Pitt gymnasts seem to be
ready for this meet. Freshman
Jackie Calderone will be adding
depth to the Panther lineup the

psyched for the season.”

“With three meets under our belts,
mistakes seem to be diminishing. We
are really looking polished," Sanft
said. “It’s just a matter of keeping
mistakes out and throwing clean
routines.”

Senior captain Gretchen Speich
believes the team is doing well,
although scoring in past meets has
not been a true reﬂection of the
team’s abilities.

"As a whole-team, we are working
well; we are pulling ourselves
together and have a good mental
attitude,” Speich said. “I hope every-
one has a good meet. If everyone

hits and the scores are right, it would ‘

The Panther volleyball team is .
about to embark on a journey into
the talented part of power-volleyball
land called Division "East and
Midwest. -

The adventurous 1983 schedule
starts tonight when coach Ray
Reilly and the freshmen-dominated
squad travel to the Showcase of the
East—the Penn State Invitational.

In the four-category, thF°¢‘t°3m

pool, Pitt will compete against Edin-

 . ro and Ohio State in their pool

 ,. play and then move on to bigger and

better matches as the classic pro-

gresses. Pitt is relatively injury-free
going into the Invitational.

‘‘I’d say we’re in pretty good spir-
its right now,” Reilly said as he
reviewed his team’s ﬁnal practice
yesterday. “We’re still free-balling
on offense and are preparing a

*defense for teams with tall hitters
like Penn State and Rutgers.

Besides these two, other schools
travelling to University Park tonight
are Michigan, Ball State, George

Enter Penn Sta

Mason, Winnipeg and Notre Dame.
Barring any major disasters, Reilly
expects the Panthers to finish in the
tournament’s top four. He will have
to do it, though, after a long layoff;
the team last saw action in Canada’s
Excalibur Classic three weeks ago.

“It’ll be a good weekend for us,”
Reilly said. “We are presently the
only ones rebuilding in the East; ev-
eryone else is returning veteran pro-
grams with a lot of people 6-6 and
over.”

During the squad’s three-week
layover, Reilly has had the squad
work on fundamentals, t_rying to
orient the six freshmen to a college
environment and to make a smooth
transition between coaching
attitudes.”

»What the freshmen will have to
deal with primarily is the change

from Canadian to American volley-

ball style.

“Up in Canada, there’s a lot of
quick stuff on the inside and out-
side,” Reilly said. “Here in the states,
it’s a higher, slower game..Of course,
our game has always had a—quick
offense, which we’ll employ this

weekend."

‘‘If any at all, that offense will
the key to our success.”

Just as the Excalibur Classic was a
showcase for Canadian talent in the
college ranks, so too will be the Penn
State Classic. Perhaps the kind of
matches to be found tonight might

two-mile relay team. They have
never ﬁnished in the Top Six at
Nationals, which is the cut-off point
for All-America honors. But they
have been close.

During Gallagher’s freshman
year, Pitt ran poorly in the qualiﬁ-
ers. The next year, Geary temporar-
ily quit the team, saying that he had
taken his abililty as far as he could.
Again, the Panthers failed to qual-
ify. And last year, Garland Brown

“_Over the past,” Gallagher says,
“for one reason or another we’ve
never shown the potential.” ~

One reason might be Mike Agos-
tinella, the former weight-coach-

legiate volleyball. Not so, says
Reilly.

“I'm surprised that hasn't hap-

“He somehow arrived at the posi-
tion as track coach with very little
experience,” Gallagher says. “They

In came John,Vasvary to replace

Agostinella, and school records .

Panthers have nicknamed Vasvary
“The General,” which Gallagher

“He let us know_ from the begin-
ning that things will go his way and

“I'll be pleased to death if they

At least that's something optimis- V

Now, Gallagher and the two-mile

“It’s our third year now for Mill-

“But it's such a

crowds and national television that
it’s still easy to get psyched up for.
It’s a real priviledge.”

Swimmers Look TO WVU

By scorr DELLETT

After suffering a letdown to Clar-
ion last weekend, the Lady Panther
swimiteam has regrouped and is
ready for a difficult meet against
West Virginia tomorrow at Trees
POOL .

According to coach David Belo-
wich, the team has worked out its
problems and will be ready for the
challenge of the Lady Moun-
taineers.

“We had a good team meeting
Monday, and since then, practices
have been excellent,” he said. “Bas-
ically, I'd rather talk with the team
before going into action.”

Pitt must ready itself for a vastly

. improved West Virginia team, a

team that didn’t lose anyone to grad-
uation and recruited a good -fresh-
man class. Kim Coffman has done

" well in the 50-and 100-yard back

stroke events and is the backbone of
the 400-yard medley relay squad.
Patty Caspary, a Baldwin native has
has helped out the Lady Mountain-
eers in the breaststroke and distance
freestyle events. -

‘‘W-e were really high on her,”
Belowich said. “She has good
talent.”

offers.

Veterans Nancy Hallmon and
Debbie Scott supply strength in the
backstroke and distance freestyle
events.

. “West Virginia’s best events are in
the backstroke,” Belowich said.
“They are four-deep in the event. I
would like to see Diana Firth and
Wendy Morgan do well.

“West Virginia also has a good

sprint freestyle team. They have a “

tradition of swimming faster in these
events.”

The Lady Panther divers will go
up against West Virginia junior
Tammy Weber and sophomore
Trish Keith.

“Their diving team is solid,” Belo-
wich said. “Yvonne Johnston and
Tricia Schultz should do okay.

“BOth (Keith and Weber) ought to
give us some trouble, but we’ll be
able to handle them,” diving coach
Julian Krug said. “Yvonne has a
cold, but she should be ready by Sat-
urday. Tricia Schultz has had a
phenomenal week of practice. She’s
in good shape.” I

There, may be several keys that
will tell which way the met will go.
One is the use of. senior Jan Ujevich.
Belowich refused to release his
lineup for tomorrow, stating he

would like to surprise the Lady
Mountaineers.

“Jan will play a key role in the
meet,” Belowich said.

Another will be the performance
.of the 400-yard freestyle relay, the
final event of the meet. The Lady
Mountaineers shaved for the meet
and swam a 3:34.71. The Lady
Panthers had a time of 3:34.74,
swimming without special

\ preparation. ,_ g N
“That’s the kind of races we wil.«£~:"

have tomorrow,” Belowich said.
A third factor may be the kind of
breaks each team receives.

“If we get the breaks, then it

should be no contest,” Belowich
said. “If we dOn’t, then we have to
get solid performances from
everyone."

The Lady Panthers must also
avoid the problems they’ve suffered
recently.

“We can't have any breakdowns,”
Belowich said. “West Virginia is not
a weak club. A

Recently we striﬁped the labels
off our beer and as ed young
New Yorkers to try it. 8 out of 10
liked it. They said it was a good
tasting, smooth beer,

When we tried it on more beer
drinkers, they were sur rised
to find out it was Schae er Beer.

They said things like, ”I’m
shocked that this is Schaefer
beer, because I really didn't
think that I liked it, and
I honestly do.” .

Today's Schaefer is being
brewed by the Stroh family, who
have devoted their 200 years of
brewing experience to making
Schaefer better than ever. Try it.

iToday’s Schaefer will make a
Schaefer drinker out of you, too.

Tell us about your naked beer
test and we may print it. Write‘
to: Schaefer Naked Beer Test,
PO. Box 1703,»Grand Central
Station, N.Y., NY 10163.
