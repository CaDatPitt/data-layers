A $19 million grant has been
awarded to three computer scientists
at Carnegie-Mellon University for
research on new super-computers
for the U.S. Department of Defense.

The grant, which came from
DARPA, the Defense Advance
Research Project Agency, is
expected to be $5 million_ this year,
$6 million in l985 and $7 million in

1986. ,

The principal researchers are pro-

fessors of computer science Raj

Reddy, also director of the Robotics .

Institute, and H.T. Kung and Allen
Newell. Each will continue to con-
duct research in the ﬁelds in which
they are nationally known.
Matthew McGuire, science _arid
technology account executive within
CMU’s department of public rela-
tions, explained the kind of research

each scientist is involved in. Kung,
he said, is to “continue developing
technology in systolic array, which
he developed five years ago. In sim-
ple terms, this is a new way of speed-
ing. up calculations.” McGuire
added, “Newell is continuing his
work in production systems.”

He continued, “Reddy is applying
multi-processing architecture to
solving problems with intelligent
computer systems using speech,
vision and robotics.”

Reddy himself, unavailable for
comment, did say to the Pittsburgh
Post- Gazette that “advances in arti-
ficial intelligence expected from the
study will , have important conse-
quences for commercial computing
 Medical diagnosis, long a dream
of computer experts, will be among
possible benefits.”

To the best of McGuire’s knowl-
edge, the research will continue in
the campus labs where the scientists
are already operating. It will have
beneficial economic effects in the

Pittsburgh area, directly creating 50

“I thought the speech was
excellent. He is supportive of the
guerrilla movement to bring
independence to South -Africa,”
said Brenda Berrian of Black
Studies, regarding the lecture
delivered Wednesday by Robert
Magabe, the prime minister of
Zimbabwe.

“[He gave a] clear position on
what he thought — that South
Africa can’t be independent."
She was referring to two south-
ern African countries, South
Africaand Nambia. The first is
white-ruled and the second is
occupied by the South African
government.

However, Berrian also said
that she found the comparison of
the economic ties between Zim-
babwe’s government and the
Heinz Corporation to a marriage

' that has produced a child as
excessive. “It was obvious‘ that
Heinz Corporation was getting
more- than its share of the bar-
gain; the comparison was objec-
tionable because of the beans."
She explained that the beans are

McGuire professed that the grant
“reaffirms the prominence nation-
ally of the CMU computer science
department Not only will the
research make it easier for the
Department of Defense to do the
nation's computing, but it will revo-
lutionizethe way research into artifi-
cial intelligence is conducted.”

Richard Cyert, CMU’s president,
said to the‘ Post-Gazette that the
grant is. “a fantastic opportunity for
CMU to participate in what is an
"extremely important step in compu-
ter technology.”

Cyert also said that the research is
expected to lead to the production of
“several unique machines which will
be part of the public domain and
which will make a significant contri-
butionto scientific work throughout
the country, especially in artificial
intelligence and large—scale
computing."

The Student Government Board
has just established a new commit-
tee, the Freshman Council. The
Council is divided into three parts:
Research and Study, Public Rela-
tions and Special Projects.

[because of]-the fact that Pitts-
burghers and Americans rarely
hear about African countries.
Our media puts it cither/ or; it’s _
much more complex. To hear it
said by leaders of Communist
nations drives the point across.“

Wednesday's lecture marked
the announcement of the second
fellowship offered to a scholar
from _a third world country to
study at Pitt. The previous recip- .
ient, Godwin Amuzu of Ghana, »
who takes courses in economics
and does research on Ghana's
economic growth and structural
change, said that even though he
“had to go" to the lecture, he _
found it interesting. “What you
read in The New York Times is
not first-hand information. He '
[Magabe] gave the first-hand
information.” i '

Godwin Amuzu views his two-
year stay in the U.S. as
interesting.

“I understand the American
system_a little more; l’ve come to
appreciate the American system.» -.
I look at things more objectively, ,
can analyze things more criti-
cally.” However, “Knowledgeis -

He also commented on the
economic department‘ at Pitt.
“It’s eminent, classesare small.
Pitt is f1rst—class university.”

However, what he would like
to see is African Studies. “No
African Studies as such, Black
Studies is not enough,” Amuzu
said. i

Manager's Reception Sunday Morning

If you have back pains, to whom
do you go for treatment? Your local
doctor? How about a chiropractor?
Perhaps you could see both. At least
that is the hope of Dr. Edward G.
Stasko, a chiropractic physician
here in Oakland.

Stasko, a graduate of Pitt, is the
founder of the Allegheny County
Chiropractic Associates. The group
has three basic motives: first, stan-
dardization of patient care or proper
evaluation; second, research where
results of patient progress will be
shown on paper; and third, to act as
a liason between two groups — doc-
tors and chiropractors.

Sounds fairly harmless, right?
However, this is not the case. Doc-
tors and chiropractors have been at
odds ever since the professions have

l930s, chiropractic healing was all
done “under the table,” so to speak.
This philosophy has not changed.

Chiropractors have always taken
the “hands-on approach," states
Stasko. “They believe in the impor-
tance of touch to give the patient a
sense of security. Medicine is a lot
more restrained; therefore, it cannot
be holistic. Chiropractors are more
for the person.” ’

Chiropractors now claim to heal
not only back problems but also
problems that can result from spinal
ailments such as headaches and neck
pains and even pre-menstrual syn-
drome and stress.

According to Dr. Stasko, “Medi-
cine makes a chemical change when
the body may not necessarily need it.
lnstead of healing the patient, medi-
cine alters the feelings. Medicine
treats the phenomena instead of

“They [chiropractors] make a lot
of unsupported claims without the
adequate scientific evidence to sup-
port them.”

The issue of doctor vs. chiroprac-
tor has become quite political, it
appears. “Chiropractors have
become a unified political force
because they are somewhat more
recognized than other healers [such
as homeopathic or herbal doctors],"
Coughlihan explained. For exam-
ple, they receive third party pay-
ments (insurance, workmen’s
compensation) that most others do
not.

The problem with chiropractors,
in Coughlihan’s opinion, is twofold.
They are not knowledgeable enough
about the human physiology and
functioning to treat people using
their methods, and chiropractors
may attract those with serious

opposed to physicians. Chiroprac-
tors need to define what they do, as
there are as many as 17 different

from your classes for a few hours,”

you'll go crazy!”

Remember the pre-election debates between President Car-
ter and Ronald Reagan in I980? Remember how Carter grew
visibly upset by Reagan’s cool, confident display of political
rhetoric? Itris certain that many people were swayed by Rea-
gan’s skills during the debate, so swayed that they gave him
their vote that year. Well, it is no wonder .that, four years later,
this master rhetorician is dubbed the “great communicator.”

This year's debates will provide an excellent lesson in presi-
dential rhetoric for those who will take notice of not only what
is being said but also how it is conveyed. The first set of debate
issues focuses on domestic concerns such as unemployment,
school prayer, the deficit and the direction of our economy.
Chances are these issues will be cloaked in references to moral-
ity,jshadowed by figures and statistics that we don’t understand
and can't verify, and will provide an atmosphere with which.

_ Reagan can maintain a high degree of confidence.

The second series will be more interesting as the two candi-

dates discuss foreign policy issues that have mysteriously

remained dormant during the better part of Reagan's term. It
may prove to be more difficult for the president to confidently
support foreignpolicies that have been developed rhetor/ically
though not practically applied. Let us keep an open ear to all of
the “isms” that are likely to show up in thediscussion of these
issues. .

The public’s response to this year’s debates will be very
interesting in that it will indicate the level of political awareness
of the American public. Granted, the majority of voters do not
know what they should about the issues involved here. Few
people have the time to educate themselves on these matters
Many don’t even read newspapers let alone examine them.
However, these debates will be loaded with some very rudimen-
tary methods of persuasion and appeal that often go unnoticed
though should not. '

Being a politician, Mondale is not unaware of rhetorical
techniques used to attract voters. It is highly unlikely, however,
that he will match President Reagan's level of sophistication.
Reagan can make people cry even when there’s no crisis — that
is about as manipulative as one can get withoutmobilizing the

- populace to war .._. could that be next? What is so serious about
all this is the fact that a large portion of voters just take -it all in -

without question. This president is more than persuasive. He is
magnetic, daring and totally elusive. .

It is now time for the American public to shed their senti-
ments and really listen to what is being said. This series of
debates is one that must not be missed nor misconceived. The
important thing is that we vote after critically examining the V
candidates‘ approaches to the issues. Considering the present
state of affairs, we cannot be too critical. '

Journalistic propriety

questioned by reader

.I was most disturbed by Maurice
Mallin’s article (Sept. 19, 1984)
which dealt with the dangers and
problems of approaching the issue
of nuclear arms in ‘a simplistic’ and
emotionally charged manner. It is
certain that this theme was not cor-
rectly perceived by .the editorial
staff. This is evidenced in the way the
article was titled: “The Pros And
Cons Of Being Nuked” (It should be
noted that this title was not chosen
by Mallin).

Mallin in no way discussed the
“pros of being a victim of a nuclear
attack. No rational individual would
ever conceive of a positive outcome
resulting from such circumstance.
Ironically, The Pitt News has proven
Mallin’s point — that such irrational
and distasteful approaches to the
problem‘ in no way contribute to the
public’s understanding of the prob-
lems that beset us.

Further impropriety is noticed 
the misspelling of Mallin’s surname.
The correct spelling is M-A-L-L-I-
N. There is little excuse for such an
error, given the fact that Mallin has
published several articles in The Pitt
News on the same general subject.

Mallin is a masters degree candi-

date of the Graduate School of Puh- ’

lie and International Affairs. To

further his professional career, he
has made a concerted effort to pub-
lish. Unfortunately, the manner in
which the article in controversy was

\published will cast a shadow of
unrespectability on Mallin’s other-
wise noteworthy collection of
publications.

As a graduate student, I detest the
fact that The Pitt News has shown a
lack of concern for journalistic and
academic propriety. Let it be known
that such practice shall onlyserve to
discourage others for utilizing The
Pitt News as a medium for
discourse.

Church. To maintain that intention
to continue to support abortion is to
be unrepentant of the offense -— and
is grounds for excommunication.

I don’t know of anyone serving
in public office (except a nun) who
has been accused of supporting pro-
abortion legislation and become of
the _ subject of examination or

excommunication by the church. I '

think the Catholic Church can and

does see a difference between the _

way a legislator is involved with
abortion and the way in which the
immediate participants in the act are
involved. \

I don’t think, though, that the dif-
ference is so great that Catholics —
or anyone — should believe that a
legislator’s decisions on abortion are
only as important as, say, his deci-
sions on tax breaks for private
school tuition. Abortion concerns
something too near the human heart
and conscience. It deserves to be
argued and fought out for as long as

» people feel urged to fight about it.

And there are too manyother issues
I'd say the same about.

While Eisenstat has made an
interesting effort to describe changes
in the U.S. legal system, it's not at all

‘ clear that he’s done so with any accu-

racy. “These laws, which have held
up for over two centuries,” as he
says, were apparently formed (or the
basis for them was formed) over two
centuries ago. Was the U.S. then as
“highly secular” as it is now? No, of
course not —— so those laws probably
represent a great deal of religious
and moral thinking.

Perhaps his meaning is that we

I enforce and obey these old, old laws-

in an entirely different spirit. I agree
that when we consider whether an
action is or should be legal, we usu-
allygthink in terms of what’s “right”
or “fair” to the people involved. And
we think universally, trying to make
certain that we canfairly apply a rule
to many people in similar instances.
It's the few who think immediately
in terms of what religious law
applies. ._

But we are not so logical as Eisen-
stat implies. Utilitarianism does
form the basis for many, and maybe
most, legal decisions. It cannot do
for all decisions. Eisenstat is not tak-
ing into account that any form of
utilitarianism — as general one or an
exclusive one —//"strictly and uni-
formly applied to decision-making,
amounts to a creed in itself.

, It's absurd to imply that under our
laws, “evil is nothing more than a
gross annoyance." Surely no major-

' « i_ty of Americans thinks so; how silly V
‘to deny thatthe nation’s laws reflect ‘,_.

to suspect the speaker has stopped

that isn’t well explained: people
might be “narrowminded" simply
because they disagree with
Eisenstat.
lf Eisenstat thinks the Republican

heady rush of righteous indignation,
you failed to take note of a few
obvious points.

coverage and score reports). It is a
self-evident point of rudimentary
logic that the visibility or anonymity
of a writer has nothing whatsoever
to do with the accuracy of his state-
ments. But why quibble over the
trivial stuff when there are even
more amusing things to talk about?

Slanderous? Nothing has
appeared in" The Pitt News that has
cast aspersions on the moral charac-

ter of football players. Slander refers r

to the production of false statements
that are injurious to the subject of
those statements. To report that the
Panthers have lost all but one game,
including one for which they were
favored by a significant point
spread, even if the reportmis embel-
lished by sarcasm and humor, is
hardly slanderous. Something to the
effect of “Becky Rollin is a raving

lunatic," be

slanderous.

And come now, do you really
believe that, as stated in your letter,
“the football team is at the stadium
for up to eight hours per day  at
grueling games every Saturday that
literally tear apart their bodies just
to give the Pitt students some enter-
tainment on a Saturday afternoon
and a sense of pride”? Could anyone
really be daft enough to think that
the football players don’t do what
they do because they like it?

however, might

Probably the most damning thing
thus far to have appeared in The Pitt
News about the Panthers has been
the scathingly angry letters that you
and your kindred spirits have writ-
ten; they suggest that football play-
ers don’t have the guts to do what

they want or the depth of soul, and

strength of character to do some- 

thing for the thing itself, rather than

for the rewards to be reaped. “Tiff  :3
football team is working their butts '

off” for us? Oh. Too bad.

As to football players being intel-: -

ligent and pursuing “highly inﬂuen-
tial positions in all ﬁelds," so what?

What has this to do with the team’s ,.
ability to do well in an athletic con- ‘ ‘ 

test? In purely practical terms,

would n‘t it b'e more commendable to . 
have a team composed of brutishi  J‘

clay majors that won most of its

games than to have a team com- 
posed_ of pre—meds that loses with . 
alarming consistency? I don’t care ' O ‘

about my doctors ability to play
football if he can cure my illness, and
vice-versa.

But forgive me. lfl go on forever,

- "These are the facts: For the first

 time in 10 years, Pitt has lost four
- consecutive, games. Pitt has excep-

tionally good talent this year: Bill

' Fralic, an offensive tackle, was con-

sidered in the running for the Heis-

‘ man trophy; Troy Benson, a senior,

«tri-captain, middle linebacker. The

. effect? The university is shocked.

Newspapers are taking cheap shots

at the team, students have signs

hanging outside their windows say-

‘ing, “Fire Foge" and “At least Pitt’s

Consistent.” One student even gave

Vhis season football pass to a little
’ boy in a Mountaineers shirt. News-

papers claim that the ball players
now have to be students. The cam-
pus is disgusted with the team.
Three players talked with The Pitt
News Wednesday evening to offer

' explanations to why the team is 1-4

and to tell how they feel about the
lack of support they’re receiving on

V. and off campus.

Troy Benson started by saying,
“Our losses are a combination of a
lot of things."

“Most of all,” added junior quar-
terback John Congemi “the expecta-
tions of the team are higher than
ever. Last year, Pitt started with a,
shaky football team. We took what
we had and did a good job."

“We got a lot ofbreaks then,"said
junior defensive tackle Bob Bucz-
kowski. “This year, it seems every
weakness we have, and every error
we make, the opposing team takes
full advantage of the opportunity."

“It’s sort of like driving down a
road and you know there’s a pothole
on the left side,” explained Con-
gemi, “so you go to the right side and
suddenly there’s something there,
too.”

The players said that there isn’t
any conflict among the team
members. “We wouldn't be on the
team if we didn't have the potential
to pull together and make things
work,” Benson said. “Naturally.

Sothey’re not so bad after all?

By Inmgrld Smith
,. The Pitt News

everyone wants to put the blame on
us or the coaching staff. But we’re a
team too. We all are working
together. He [Foge Fazio] feels just
as responsible and just as bad when
we lose a game.”

“That’s a lot more than we can say
for the support we’ve been receiving
from the fans,” remarked
Buczkowski.

According to the players, they’re
as disappointed with the reaction of
the campus as the campus is with the
team. “We’re irritated with the com-
ments we read and hear,” said Ben-
son, “it's like kicking somebody
when they’re already down.”

“Last week, in the West Virginia
game, I looked up in the stands with
about five minutes left in the fourth
quarter and over half of the student
section was gone,” Congemi said,
disappointed. c

“It’s a lot different than last year,"
added Buczkowski, “I remember
when we played Florida State. We
were losing 13-0, and the.fans were
behind us 100 percent. We could
actually hear them screaming from

   A A  

the stands. The team pulled
together, came back and won l7-
l6.’’

“We’re doing the best possible job
we can,” exclaimed Benson. “When
we come back after winning a game,
we celebrate with everyone. But
when we come back after losing a
game, nobody stands behind us;
they just want to make cheap shots
— including The Pitt News.”

Several cartoons were run
recently ‘by the newspaper suggest-
ing football players never have to
study or attend classes.

Actually, the average player takes
approximately 12 to 15 credits dur-
ing the season and spends roughly
three to four hours a day in classes.
Studyingisaznmpleted on an individ-
ual basis. “It depends on how much
you want to succeed academically,"
said Benson.-

As freshmen, all_ the players
receive attendance cards that must
be signed by their professors and
returned to the stadium office. After

their freshman year, the only time a I R

player is required to keep an attend-
ance card is if he has failed a class. If
the attendance card is not com-
pleted, the player is not permitted to
play in the next football game.

In addition to academics, each
player spends five to six hours at the
stadium practicing, attending meet-
ings and lifting weights. “We have to
be dedicated,” said Benson.

“Now, we’re no close knit family
with the media," explained Benson.
“But we represent them, we repres-
ent Pitt. The Pitt News should sup-
port us, and the students should
support us. I once said that we may
be 0-3 but therc’s no place we’d
rather be. Now we’re I-4 and
nobody wants to be a part of Pitt
football — nobody except us. We’re
still proud.” »

Meanwhile up at the stadium,
practice continues,‘ more intense
than ever. The players take their 1-4
record and put it behind them. “If
this being 1-4 is the worst thing that's
ever happened at Pitt, think of how
we feel,” Benson said.

Educating student voters

Aiming to help students cast a bet-
ter informed vote on Nov. 6, the
National Student Campaign for
Voter Registration today
announced plans to organize simul-
taneous forums on the presidential
elections at over 100 campuses on
Oct. 21. ’

The campus debates, collectively
titled “Showdown ‘84,” will be held
immediately before or after the
nationally televised debate between
Walter Mondale and Ronald Rea-
gan. The presidential debate will
also be aired on large screen televi-

Bob Kramer and Betsy Fitzpat-
rick are the liason between the Stu-
dent Government Board and the
Freshman Council. After attending
seminars, they realized that Pitt’s
Student Government needed to be
reevaluated. “We needed more stu-
dent involvement. The Freshman
Council orients people to student
government,” said Kramer.

“Weneeded a voice from the stu-
dents,” said Fitzpatrick.

The board members are enthusi-
astic towards the Freshman Coun-
cil. The Council is the basis of an
important introduction to student
government.

“People who are members of the
Freshman Council may be future
members of the Student Govern-
ment Board,” said Kramer.

Jim Garboden, president of the
Freshman Council, thinks it is a
great concept. “People get involved,
and it’s a good way to meet people."

saw the Panthers net 26 and 32
yards but no points, Heyward
entered the game and led the
Panthers downfield. Sparked by
30 yards from “Ironhead,” the
Pitt offense drove to the East
Carolina 27-yard line. Then with
10:38 remaining in the half, Pitt
took a 7-0 lead as Congemi hit
Bill Wallace in the left side ofthe
end zone with a 27-yard touch-
down pass thatgave the Panthers
a lead they would not relinquish.

After holding ECU on their
next possession, the Panthers
again stormed down the field.

Panthers drove up the field on

ciated play of what was to be a
touchdown drive was the 44-yard
pass from Congernito Chuck
Scales that putthe Panthers on
the ECU 9-yard line. One of the
major problems this year has
been the lack of a deep threat by
the Pitt‘ offense. That 44-yard
gain was the longest pass play for
the Panthers this year. Fazio was
“very pleased with that [Scales’
catch]. He fought the guy all the
way. He had to go up and get the
ball and he did.” Although other
attempted bombs fell incom-
plete, Fazio still plans to keep
«. trying because, “other teams
have to respect it.” The drive"
ended with Congemi hitting Pat
Schipani withia 4-yard touch-
. down pass.

Just 26 seconds into the final
quarter, Mark Brasco connected
on a 37-yard ﬁeld goal to close
out the scoring. Maybe two‘com-

the game. “We didn’t play that

He did, and so did the Panthers.

it:

By Mark A.8lndler
The Pitt News

It wasn't that long ago that Dan
Marino left Oakland a crescendo, of
boos. Boos for not leading the
Panthers to a planned national
championship in 1982. Boos for not
living up to standards assigned him
as a Heisman Trophy candidate.
And boos for throwing over 20 inter-
ceptions in a second consecutive
season.

Although it wasreal, everything
seems like a bad dream now, in
Marino’s second season as starting
quarterback for the Miami Dol-
phins. The Central Catholic gradu-
ate came home in fitting fashion
yesterday, leading the undefeated
Dolphins past the -Steelers 31-7.

His performance at Three Rivers
Stadium before 59,103 native’s did
nothing to distract from building
him as one of the, if not the most,
dominating passers in the National
Football League. For reasons unbe-
knownst to those who scouted him
for the draft, it all began last season.

Pushing off from his first start in
early October, Marino completed
over 58 percent of his passes-last
season for 2,210 yards, 20 touch-
downs» and only six interceptions.
His 96.0 quarterback efficiency rat-
ing in the AFC marked him the fifth
rookie ever to lead the conference in
that category. Marino ended the
year, a 27-20 loss to Seattle in the
playoffs, as the fifth most prolific
passer in Dolphin history.

By year’s end, that will change.
Yesterday marked the third season
he topped 200 yards, hitting for 226
and two touchdowns. In the opener
against Washington he amassed 311
through the air and last week against
St. Louis broke former Dolphin
David Woodley’s single game mark
as he threw for 429 yards andthree
touchdowns.

With 17 touchdowns and 1,753
passing yards to his credit in just six
games, Marino’s dissection of the
opposition defies explanation.

“We're very fortunate we have the
type of talent we do on offense and
defense,” Marino humbly said in a
crowded visitors’ locker room after-
ward‘. “Whenever we have that we'll
be successful.”

Indeed, Marino has a ﬂeet of
receivers that wouldmake Federal
Express successful. His favorite one,
of course, is third-year man Mark
“Super" Duper, who leads Miami in’
average yardage (21.60) and touch-
downs (six). But Duper got open
only twice against-the Steelers, so
Marino. went downtown once each
to tight ends Joe Rose and Bruce
Hardy. ‘ .

yards out.

“That first touchdown was a good
feeling; it gave us a chance to get
back in the game,” Marino said.
“They did blitz occasionally. They
did it in certain situations. Fortu-
nately, we were able to read them
and break off.”

The Dolphins broke away further
when, on their next drive, Marino
started things off with a 15-yard pass
to Clayton. Five plays later, Marino
split the Steeler defense down the

I middle, hitting Rose for a 34-yard

touchdown pass. It proved costly, as
strong safety Donnie Shell pum-
melled Rose, separating a shoulder.
Marino said of the play,“[The Steel-
ers] were playing a coverage we
knew we’d get through. And [Rose]
had the speed. That was enough."

“It’s a goodfeeling to _come in here and win. I've always
been a fan of the Steelers. ” —— Dan Marino

“They took Duper away from us,
throwing the weak
[Bryan Hinkly] at us,” Marino said.
“Fortunately, Clayton was open.”

Ah, Mark Clayton. He never did

catch a touchdown but stung the
Steelers’ defense for 110 yards on.

five catches, including one for_33
yards. But it was Marino’s two
second-quarter passes that Miami
needed to hand the Steelers a .500
record. I ,
After the two_ teams played for the
punt in the first quarter,‘ during
which Hinkly intercepted Marino
for the quarterback’s only blemish,
he readied the offense for strike-
force capability. In a 10-play, 69-
yard drive, Marino hit Clayton twice
for 39 combined yards and later hit
Hardy for the 7-0 score from three

linebacker

Forthe umpteenth time, Miami

head coach Don Shula watched his .

No. 1 draft choice (27th overall) spell
the opposition unconscious. The
Dolphins are 14-1 in games in which
Marino has started. —

“I thought Marino handled him-

self today as well as his first day
here,” Shula said. “He's never awed,

he’s never concerned. Some worry
about his coming home and hand-
ling the pressure. You know, last
night the players had some time off
and Danny was the first one to show
up at an 8:30 meeting. He was look-
ing at films and executing game
plans. Marino should be a gameball
winner each week. He’s just been
outstanding."

- Describing his junior year at Pitt,
no one could have said it better. In

 

Marino returns to lead Miami over-Steeleris 

    

leading coach Jackie Sherrill’s
Panthers to an incredible third
straight ll-l season, Marino per-
formed like he has with the D01-
phins. En route to becoming the
Panthers’ all-time leading passer in
three years, Marino completed 60
percentof his passes for 2,786 yards
and 37 touchdowns. Against Geor-

gia in the Sugar Bowl came 261, and-

three of those included a 33-yard
toss to tight end John Brown with 35
seconds remaining for a 24-20 win.
, Although Marino finished his
Panther years with school records in
total yards (8,567 carrier yards and
79 touchdown passes), 21 intercep-
tions in 1981 were followed by 22
more his senior year. That was spat
upon asmuch as Pitt’s 9-3 record
and its 7-6 Cotton Bowl loss.

But his short pro career has put
that year and those boos away.
Cheers upon his arrival at Three
Rivers Stadium proved that
yesterday.

“You get a chance to play at Three
Rivers, play the Steelers and their
tradition,” Marino began. “It’s a
good’ feeling to come in here and
win. I‘ve always been a fan of the
Steelers. It’s a lot of excitement.”

Marino continues to provide just

' that before throngs of people, home

and away. His sudden rise to promi-
nence —- the type achieved by similar
NFL prodigy, Terry Bradshaw,
before his retirement — still reminds
one of why the scouts were so wrong.
So wrong about Dan Marino. So
wrong about his potential.

Now that Marino “is there,"
though, don‘t ask him about the
invincibility he shows. “You try to
keep going out, do your job and
score as many points as possible,”
Marino averred. “We’re playing
very well, so is the defense. When the
defense plays well, you get the ball
more and more chances to score.”

He hasn’t changed that much.

to Ricky Nichols passes and Reggie
Branch blasts into the line before the
Pirates drive was stalled on the Pitt
24. On a third-and-six play, Speed
threw into the end zone for Henry
Williams but Speed's pass was high
and an outstretched Williams could
not hold on to it. The incompletion
brought a fourth-down field goal
attempt by Jeff Heath. The kick fell
short and the Pitt offense went back
to work.

This time the Panthers took it
through the air. Foregoing the
ground game on the drive, Congemi
was good on four of five throws,
highlighted by a spectacular leaping
-catch by ﬂanker Chuckic Scales.
__l_2unning a sideline pattern, Scales
stopped at the 9-yard line and sailed
«into the air with defender .Calvin
Adams all over him. Scales reached
over Adams and pulled in Conge-
mi’s rainbow for a 44-yard gain.

Two plays later, Congemi rolled
right and found tight end Pat Schi-
pani open for the touchdown to give
Pitt a 14-0 lead they would take with
them to the locker room at the half.

Refering to his acrobatic catch,
Scales said, ‘‘I just went back for it. I
went up and pulled it down. Overall,
I was very satisfied with the way I
played. I’m getting used to playing
as a receiver now. At first my heart
was still at running back, but I’m

lina moved from their own 3l to the

stalled and the field goal unit was
called on. This attempt by Heath
was good from 33 yards and the
Pirates were on the board.

Scales returned the ensuing kick-
off 29 yards to the 31 when a new
Pitt game plan went into effect: Give
it to Heyward. The Panthers didjust
that, with Heyward punishing the
Carolina defense for 56 of his ll0
yards.

“Congemi really did a good job
today,” said Fazio, “He called a
heady game. He was taking what
they were giving, like we used to do.”

The junior quarterback said of his
team’s fortune this season, “Who
cares if we’re not going to a bowl
game? I want to play good on Satur-
dayjust because we work so hard all
week.”

Fazio, however, did not like ever-
ything he saw, “The defense was
shaky at times. I don’t know if we
tackled poorly or if it was because of
their speed.” The coach also admit-
ted to being concerned about the
kicking game. “Brasco has to relax.
It looked like on that second missed
attempt some one came rushing in
and Mark rushed it. This team is
emotionally drained‘ and physically
beat up. We still have a lot of young
players and we are going to make
mistakes.” '

Still, Fazio said, “That team was
happier in that locker room after the
game. than l’ve seen them in a long
time.”

Syndrome
strikes  
again

By Laurie Kubli
The Pitt News

A According to soccer coach Joe

Luxbacher, it’s been going.on all
season long, and it happened
again on Saturday. The “missed
opportunity syndrome” struck
again, leaving the Panthers with
a disappointing l-l tie with Cali-
fornia State. _

Pitt connected on only one of
35 shots on goal, while Cal State
scored its goal on one of three -
and that‘was on a penalty kick.
Mathematically translated,
that’s 33 percent for Cal State
and an infinitesimal 3 percent for
Pitt. '

“The team played hard but not

I well," said Luxbacher after the

loss. “We had intensity but not
the -skill or composure. We’ve
had trouble scoring all season;
we have opportunities, but we’re
not taking advantage of them."

- The goal was scored by two-
year letter winner Rich Burk-
holder, who has played as both a
striker and wing forward. He was
assisted by David Van Nerkirk, a
sophomore forward from York,
Pa. ‘

“We could use the lack of
experience as an excuse," Lux-
bacher explained, “but I’d rather
not. The players have to learn to
react to different situations on
the field. There’s a good place on
the field to shoot, and we weren’t
doing it —— we were consistently
making the wrong decision.

“It was very dissappointing,”
Luxbacher continued. “Some of
our shots were poor percentage
shots, some were from a bad
angle and others were from too
far out." ’

The tie is the team’s first, with
four wins and three losses keep-
ing the team’s record over .500. .
Their next opponent is Youngs-
town State, and the game will be
played in Pitt Stadium at 7:15
p.m. Pitt won last season’s match .
7-0. “It’ll be a good contest," said
Luxbacher. “If we play well, we
can win it.” . g

The soccer team has three

Panthers

By Jim Brueckner
The Pitt News

Here's a variation on the Bible,
specifically the Lazarus story.
There was a certain university
football team named the Pan-
thers who were very sick. When
the people of this university
brought word of their plight to
Foge Fazio, the ever optimistic
coach told them. “This sickness

revive, defeat E.C.(.l.

is not to end in death. This team
will never die."

The (once thought dead)
Panthers arose and,_rQch_to_thg_
delight of the 26,075. who wit-
nessed this “miracle” at Pitt Sta-
dium, beat East Carolina 17-10
for their first win of the season.

The main contribution to this
initial win was a’ “resurrected”
offense that played far better
than the 17 points would indi-
cate. The 399 yards of total
offense speaks for itself. The

Panther offense enjoyed two sea-
son highs by rushing for 222
yards and gaining 399 yards total
offense.

As you can well imagine,
Fazio was more than happy with
the offense. “I take my hat off to
the guys." When asked about
specific players, Fazio com-
mented, “It was good to see John
Congemi on the money. I
thought John Congemi called a
very good game and the runners
ran hard. I was very pleased with

Craig ‘I-leyward. He's the kind of .

player who can fire up a whole
team.”

One reason for the “recovery“
of the Panther offense was that
they were cured of the “ballroom
blitz." Not once did the Panthers
go through that awful routine of
1-2-3 kick. Every time that Pitt
gamed possession of the ball,
they managed at least one first
down. The same factor that
caused this -also caused the

on the ball.”

Senior Ulana Kohutiak’s 43 kills
earned her a spot on the all-
tournament team, to which sort of
honor she is no stranger. She was
likewise selected‘ to the South Divi-
sion’s team last weekend by virtue of
41 kills, and was selected to first-
team all-Big East at the champion-
ships last season.

Kohutiak said that the team
played really well and accomplished
several things but “we're still the
same team from last year," and have
been in big tournaments before.

“Big teams motivate me more,"
Kohutiak said. “We want to prove to
them that we're just as good as they
are, even though -we didn’t win.” '

Pitt lost first to Tennessee 12-I5, '

13-15, 14-16. “They were a little
more seasoned to playing in a tight
match,” Collier remarked. “We' had

opportunities to win, but Tennessee A

was a little more experienced.” ,
Hoover said, “I think we could’ve

beat them but we had our bad .

breaks.” .. I
Pitt won the first game against
Nebraska 15-12 and appeared’

headed for a major upset by taking a _ __ I

5-1 lead in the second game but lost
9-l5. Pitt then lost the third game‘
l0-I5. “The games were" actually

‘closer than the scores indicated,”

said Collier. “They scored at oppor-
tune times."
The spikers lost to Texas 12-15,,

7-15, 13-15 on Saturday night, but’

Collier said that his team was
extremely close to winning two of
the games. “We improved from one
match to the next. On Friday, we
didn’t play too well. Our best game
was against Texas.”

Collier said that senior Cathy
Rupp set and ran the team as well as
any other setter there and also had
20 kills. Junior Sally Gillespie, he
added, “is No. 1 server on our team.
Her serving was largely responsible
for keeping us In the‘ games," Collier
said. “Serving is the best way to
score points."

Dave Hooker/ The Pitt News

  

By Bob Travers
The Pitt l‘l_ews

In the end, desire just wasn't
enough for the Pitt women’s tennis
team, as they lost their third match
of the year on Friday at Indiana Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania.

The match was tied at four
matches apiece when the final dou-
bles match was played to decide the
outcome of the contest. The Lady
Panthers could not hold on for the
win, and IUP won by the slimmest of
margins, 5-4.

“It was the most intense match we
played all year. It’s hard to really put
into words,” said Jenny Leach, the
teams No. 3 player, who lost her
match on Friday. “Everybody was
just so ﬁred up for this match, we
really wanted to win badly. Just look
at what Rhonda’Gibbs did. She was
down 2-5 in the third set and came
back to win it.” _

No. 1 player Jodi Levine was
forced toimake an agonizing per-
sonal decision-regarding the match.
“Jodi had a very important family
dinner to attend on Friday evening,”
said Leach. “But she gave up going
to it to be with the team. I know it
was a very hard decision for her to
make, and that is why we wanted it
so much; we -wanted to win it for
Jodi.” , -

Carrie deVera agreed with Leach.
“It was a very emotional match for
us. It was a close match, but we knew
it would be close. The last_ two dou-
bles matches were what determined
who won, and we didn’t get either
one of them.”

deVera, along with partner Ste-
phanie Nelson, lost one of those cru-
cial doubles matches, 4-6, 0-6.

In her single match, deVera fared
better, winning 0-6, 6-2, 6-2. “I got
beat really bad in the first set,» but
then in the second set I just decided
that I didn't have anything to lose, so
I just went out and did it.” _

Netters take defeat

“I felt like we let Jodi down,” said
Leach, “That is who I really feel bad
for. But, if she would have left we
definitely would have lost. At least
with her there we had a chance to
win up until the end.”

The Lady Panthers return home
tomorow to face St. Vincent at Trees
Courts.

C. C . team
loses

By Richard McKenzie
The Pitt News

Pitt‘s ' cross-country team was
defeated at West Virginia on Satur-
day, by the score-of 15-44. The loss
was the ﬁrst one suffered by the

' Panthers this.season, bringing their

record to 3-1. According to the scor-
ing system of cross-country, points
are registered by the position that
the runners finish; for example, first
place receives one "point, second

~ place receives two points, and so on.

The team with the lowest amount of
points wins. -

According to Coach John Vasva-
ry, “West Virginia has a very strong
team led by their two Kenyan
runners, but the team made a good
showing.” Previously the team had
beaten Robert Morris 15-47,
Duquesne and Westminister 15-49.

Getting off to such a good start is
impressive, considering that of the
'14-man roster, 12 of the runners are
either freshmen or sophomores.
Coach Vasvary says of his team,
“That is rebuilding and has been
over the past few seasons, after a
period of decline,” and has more
depth than either of his first two sea-
sons as coach of the Panthers.

Mic Haley, coach of the No. 8
women's volleyball team in the
nation, probably said it best when he
stated that Pitt gets the most for its
money -— talent-wise — than any
other team in the country.

Pitt’s spikers travelled to Tennes-
see this weekend to take on teams
tabbed fifth (Nebraska), eighth
(Texas) and 17th (Tennessee) in the
NCAA and not surprisingly, lost to
all three. Their record dropped to
12-4 but the weekend was hardly
(wasted.

The soccer team ended a game in a tie for the first
time, and Coach Luxbacher is not overjoyed. See

“We earned some respect by play-
ing nationally-ranked teams,” stated‘
coach Shelton Collier. “We gained
some self-respect playing at that
level and we established a couple of
goals."

“We wanted to knock off a couple
of Top 10 teams, and in_ all the
matches we got to 12-12,” which was
one of the goals the team had set at
the beginning of the season, accord-
ing to Collier. “The difference is
what happens on those last couple of

_ points. We were close, which is some

consolation. Also, we continued to

_ improve and prepare for future tour-

naments and the Big’East
Championships.” '

Collier said that the main devel-
opment of the weekend was gener-
ated by the play of the middle
blockers, Ulana Kohutiak and Sue
Hoover. “This tournament showed
that our middle blockers can liter-
ally play with any middle blocker in
the country. Ulana was definitely
one of the best spikers at this tourna-
ment and both Ulana and Sue
played extremely well."

The coach said that many of the
other teams’ middle blockers were
over 6-0. “These teams keyed their
blocking to Sue and Ulana, who
were still extremely effective. Sue
played even with them; it was per-
haps the strongest tournament of

proves troublesome

her career.” This is only Hoover’s
second year as a collegiate spiker.

Hoover, who was second to
Kohutiak in kills with 37, said that
she was only slightly nervous about
playing such highly-ranked teams.
“I was more excited than nervous,”
she said. “If I was too nervous, I
wouldn’t have been worth much to
the team. It didn’t intimidate me. I
was confident because I thought the
team could rely on me. '

“I said to myself, ‘I have to do it.
This pass is going to be perfect.’ It
wasn’t always (perfect),’’ Hoover
admitted, “but it helped me to do
better, it helped me to concentrate

Foge Fazio was joking with run-

ning back Craig Heyward after
Saturday’s 17-10 win over East
Carolina, “Look at that, I’m taller
than you are. You must have had
high heels on when we recruited
you,” laughed the coach as he
hugged the new offensive hero.
1 Fazio could afford to relax after
his team’s first victory since a Nov.
12, 1983 win over Army. Nobody in
this town will confuse the Panthers
with the 79 Steelers, but at this point
Fazio will take a win any way he can
get one. “I was pleased. with the way
we played. I think’our errors can be
corrected,” the. Panther boss said.
“We’ve been on the other end ofthe
stick and can appreciate a win. We
know what it’s like to get behind
early and have to play catch-up the
entire game.”

East Carolina was forced into that
position when Pitt capped its most
impressive drive of the day ‘with a
John Congemi to Bill Wallace
touchdown pass that gave the
Panthers a 7-0 first quarter lead. Pitt
began the nine-play, 90-yard drive
on its own 10-yard line with Hey-
ward getting th§.-bulk of the work,
running five times for 24 yards,
including one run up the middle for

—an 18 yard pickup. Congemi then hit

open Wallace just inside the end
zone with a perfect pass. ‘
Heyward finished the day with 17

' carries for l 10 yards, despite having’
» to split time at halfback with Charles
.Gladman. “I thought I played real

well. I couldn’t be happier with the
way I played,” Heyward said follow-
ing his best performance yet as a
Panther. “East Carolina’s defense is
probably the quickest we’ve played
all year. They have linebackers who
run 4.5 and 4.6 40’s [yard dashes] so
you know they have sped on
defense.”

Fazio had nothing but praise for
the freshman from Passiac, N..I.

“Heyward fires this teamup with the‘

way he plays. He runs over people
when he gets the ball. And right
now, we need that kind of
leadership.” I

Fullback is one position the
Panthers do not have depth prob-
lems at, and the offense lost very
little when Gladman was in at half-
back. Gladman, last week’s hero,
started the game,and ran well in the
first quarter, picking up 30 yards on
two early Panther drives, including
one series when he was called on for
seven out of eight plays.

“There was no pattern to the way
we switched them,” said Fazio of his
halfbacks. “We just went with who
had a hot hand and who was tired.”
Fazio was asked if Gladman and
Heyward might play in the same
backﬁeld. “Anything can happen,”
he said, keeping his options open. “I
would say it's a possibility.”
