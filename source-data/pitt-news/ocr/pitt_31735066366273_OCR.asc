Nation Naive About

By ALAN .DISLER A

Best selling» author Allen
Drury warned a near-capaci-
ty audience at Wednesday's

fﬁtlliidday Lecture that the

United States is a country
which is subject to naivity
about Communism, unnessary
self-criticism and weakness in
the face of challenge. Drury is
the author of the political novels,
Advise and Consent and Shade of
Difference.

Drury attributed this country’s
unfavorable situation to certain
attitudes of many Americans

which he calls “The Four Horse- I

men of the Eclipse.” These four
horsemen are: The Czame of Let’s
Pretend, Oversensitivity to World
Opinion, Self -Blame and Self-
Criticism.

The Game of Let’s Pretend is

i played by people in this country

who fail to interpret correctlyithe

This attitude is “suicide,” ac-
cording to Drury, for “there is no
mercy in the world for the naive.
The true nature of Communism
has not changed greatly in 40

years." He felt that Communists _

have remained" “as doctrinaire,

iron-clad, imperialistic, and in-
transigent as they have always
been.”

It is fallacious to-believe that
Communists “can be swayed by

UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

STERN RESIGNS  

FRIDAY, OCTOBER 8, 1&5

Allocations Bill Ruling
Makes Exit Imperative

(The following is a brief summary of the events which
took place at last evening's Student Government meeting.
Full details of the entire meeting as well as reactions will
appear in Monday’s issue of The Pitt News.) l

a. By MARSHA REIINS ,

Student Government President Eric Stern resigned his’
positions at last night's Student Government .(SG) meeting
in the Student Union'Ballroom. Stern’s resignation followed-

Senate approval of the student activities fee allocations com- _

mittee bill as amended by the Student Affairs Committee.
The bill was proposed by Senator Jim Janis and passed
by a 13 yes, seven no, and three abstention vote. It estab-

lished an appropriations committee composed of two stu- 

dents chosen by the Student Affairs Committee and two

chosen by SG.

Before leaving the meeting singing “We Shall Over-
come,” Stern said, “I feel that because of this whether it

is the composite membership of
this body or the nature and

‘ structure of this body alone that

it is a mere facade for democracy.
There was still a Reichstag build-
‘ing in Germany prior to Hitler
and during Hitler and some peo-
ple chose to sit’ in it.

p “This is not perfectly analogous,
I admit that, but I do not choose
to be a ﬁgurehead for a demo-
cracy that does not exist. I here-
by resign, not in resignation but
in righteous indignation, the of-
ﬁce of president of this august
student body. ‘Thank you.

“I ask all those who believe in
freedom to leave this room with
me.” Stern was followed out of
the Ballroom by Senators Rick
Shweder and Gerry Rosen, SG
Secretary Susan Danielson, and a
large, majority of the audience.
None of the three have formally
resigned.

Vice - President Jerry Hogan
was .appointed acting president
and Senator Marcia Bernstein,
acting vice-president. Both are
serving in their positions by de-
volution as the SG Constitution
does not speciﬁcally cover presi-
dential resignations.

Before leaving with Stern,
Shweder attempted to gain the

ﬂoor but was found out of or-‘

der. Following his walk-out, he
stated that he “was going to say,
‘Forgive them for they know not
what they do.’ But,” he continued,
“I don’t. really believe. this." What
I do believe is this: neverforget
it for you have seen tonight the
great escape from freedom.”

ERIC SIEN T _
SG President Resigns ‘ “

‘Shweder _ said that his position

was indeterminate, and that he’

had not resigned. He added that
he would think the situation out

for possible courses of action but‘ .

was “not sure there are any.”
Rosen also said he had not re-
signed but left the meeting “in
respect for Eric Stem’s opinionsffj
He found the Senate position

“illogical” especially in the face};
of 800 students who signed a‘ ,
petition asking for a student ref- 7 ‘
erendum on accepting\ the Stu- .

dent Affairs Allocations Commit-

‘tee “which is more than voted ‘

for many senators."

Rosen felt that many students

did not know the issue but those
who did were for the referendum.
He criticized The Pitt News for

“not -fully clarifying the issues.” .-

Dr. Benjamin Chinitz,
chairman of the economics
department, is leaving his
University position Monday
‘to assume a post in the U. S.
Department of Commerce,
Washington, D. C., according to
the economics department.
“Although Dr. Chinitz has not
announced his resignation, it
looks as though there will be
one,” said Dr. James Kehl, new-
ly-appointed dean of liberal arts-
He commented that Washington

A is holding up the announcement

of the resignation.

While Dr. Chinitz has handled
his new government duties on a
part-time basis the last three or
four weeks, Dr. Marina Whitman
assistant professor of economics,
has assumed his duties here.

A new chairman will probably
be announced at the end of this
week or the beginning of next
for the _economics department.

Dr. Kehl explained that» no
corrimittee as such has been set
up to appoint a new dean, but
that Dr. Richard Park, dean ‘of
the soci.al sciences, has his mind
“pretty well made up.” Dr. Park
has met with the faculty of the
department to learn their points
of view and is “prepared to move
quickly.”

The following passage is from
the Foreward to The Warped Vi-
sion, by Margaret George (Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh Press, 1965,
$6.00). Dr. Robert Colodny of
the University’s History depart-
ment wrote the Foreward. The
book deals with British Foreign
Policy from 1933-1939. It is cur-
rently available at the book store.
Theworld will ﬁnd not, pity
in your pages; -
No exercise of spirit worth
of mention; I
Only a public-funeral grief-
convention;
And all the circumspection of
the ages.
But I, for one, am grateful,
overjoyed,
And unindignant that your
punctual pen
Should have been so con-
‘ structively employed 3
In manifesting to unprivileged
men
The visionless officialized
fatuity
That once kept Europe safe

the War Diary of a Defunct Am-
bassador. A

By a creative act of imagina-
tion, the contemporary historian
can contemplate the two global
wars of the 20th century as one
uninterrupted universal tragedy.
This vision of havoc, extending
from the vvell-known Guns of Au-
gust to beyond foreseeable crises
of this decade, becomes warped
and blurred unless a focus is
provided by an hypothesis, a
theoretical construct which or-
ders and organizes the data con-
tained in mountains of state pa-
pers, diplomatic dispatches, mem-
oirs, and military histories.

It‘ is the purpose of Margaret

  

\

George’s study to provide not a
description of the course of the.
diaster of British appeasement
policy, but an explanation of the
decisions which British statesmen
reached in their agonizing effort
to stabilize a world unhinged by
war and revolution.

The policies of a closed Tory
elite, summed up from the Ver-
sailles Treaty to Munich, form a
signiﬁcant prologue to the calam-
ities of 1939-41. The Chamberlain
government, heir to and com-
pounder of the follies of Bald-
win’s stewardship of Imperial
destinies,‘ collapsed under the
hammer blows of westward-driv-
ing Fascist panzer armies. In a
few terrible days, the outposts of
Empire fell to the surging forces

.of the Asian wing of the Axis."

Appeasement —— the conservative
response to the dynamism of
counter-revolution—this brought

' the civilized world to the sorry

position vwhere it was ‘ almost
pounded into oblivion by the
power of modern nihilistic bar-
barism. That the errors and
crimes of the Munichmen were

redeemed by Churchill, his col-

leagues, and allies, suggests that

there were alternatives to con-
servative policies as these evolved
in the interwar years. Only a be-
liever in a malingnant goddess of
fate‘ would assert the contrary.

But it is equally the case that
in the practice of global politics,
actions and their consequences
tend to restrict the range of fu-
ture alternatives. Appeasement
practiced without immediate cal-
amity in Asia does not predis-
pose a British cabinet to resist
naked Italian aggression in Afri-
ca. Furthermore, the act gives
rise to a rationalization which in
turn produces a tenuous theory
about the world in which further
appeasement is implicit. Thus the
cycle of action and justiﬁcation
began in Manchuria and culmin-
ated ten years later in the awful
ruin on the beaches of Dunkirk.

It is not the intra‘-party ma-
neuvering, not the sharp rivalries
of shifting cliques that concerns,
but rather the world review of
those who from positions of im-
pregnable authority and unas-
sailable power dictated the dip-

  
 
  

lomatic decisions so pregnant
with disaster. It is this vision of
the external world nurtured by
narrow caste interests and con-
stantly reinforced by class preju-
dices that engendered .a morbid
and unreasonable fear of ‘social
revolution from the Left and pre-
disposed the Tories to View the
German Nazi thugs as counter-
weight to the Soviet Union on the
international scene, and fascists
in general as guardians of the
established order in all those
parts of the world where there
existed a real or imagined men-
ace of socialism. The irony of
this, of course, is that the para-
gon of aristocratic and imperial
traditions, Winston Spencer
Churchill, in virtue of his intel-
lectual power and political saga-

city, understood both the threat‘

of German imperialism and the
necessity of the Soviet alliance;
whereas the amateur Machiavel-

lis around Baldwin and Chamber- -

lain, prisoners of a Urial Heep
mentality, u n d e rs t 0 o d neither,
and bartered away with peevish
stubborness the hastions of na-
tional and imperial security.

Junior Criticizes
Award Absence

Editor, The Pitt News:

Upon hearing that Student Gov-
ernment (SG) had abandoned
the “spirit award” program I was

‘ amazed that it had given up its
most effective means of promot-
" ing school spirit.

In a University of. this size it is

not uncommon to hear condemn-
ations of apathy on behalf of . the
‘student body. However, at the
start of this year’s football sea-
son, a great deal of support seem-
ed forthcoming. The credit rests
with the student body; in organ-

ized groups and in individual‘

efforts.

 . Perhaps, in a way it is a sad
commentary, but incentive and
reward help to stifle thisapathy
and to rally support--—for the Uni-
versity, for" the ‘teams, for SG. I
have little doubt .that ‘many at-
tempts to compete for the award
willbe shelved and still others
will be carried out as planned.
How can’ these few attempts be

_ expected to carry the spirit of the

‘ school? How can the students be

  Facing Facts

Editor, The Pitt News:

. -In its Sept. 29 issue, The. Pitt
News printed a passage from .an
essay by Nathan Glazer on the
Berkeley revolt. It is an interest-

ing piece but is, by itself, mis-

leading. V
First of all, in the introductory

- note inserted by the editors, ref-

ence is made to “the riots on the
University of California campus
in late 1965.” This statement con-
tradicts the fact that there were
no riots on the Berkeley campus
at any time. There were forms of
non-violent action, of course: ral-
lies, testing of certain questionable
university rules, meetings, three
massive sit-ins,‘and a successful
‘student strike. It must be em-
phasized that these were forms of
non-violent protest. There was n

rioting at Berkeley. ‘ - ‘ .
1 ' Secondly, it must be remember-
ed that Mr. Glazer was one of the
few professors at Berkeley who
committed himself to a thorough

. defense of the administration of

5       Letters; T0TlV1e

Berkeley and its actions. The
overwhelming majority of the
faculty at Berkeley (one of the

most respected universityjfacul-‘ _

ties in the nation) supported the
demands of the Free Speech
Movement. Mr. Glazer must not
be considered an impartial judge

of the Berkeley situation. He ‘is, '

very deﬁnitely, a partisan.

Mr. Glazer is right, however, in
saying that the_ demands of the
students were not for “simple”
free speech.. The students were
protesting against the fact that
the university administration had
taken away traditional “free
speech” areas (after pressures
were applied by powerful right-
wing elements from the Califor-
nia community) where the vari-
ous political groups could espouse
their causes, distribute liter.ature,
recruit members and accept con-
tributions. They were also pro-
testing insulting administration
policies of . in loco parentis-—. uni-
versity administration assuming
the role of students’ parents.
They were "protesting against the

negative efforts of a bureaucratic?
multiversity -‘and ,-a»g.aVi_nst;_ the V

E cl ° t
theory andreality of the “know-
ledge factory.” They were, too,
protesting against unfair actions
taken against eight members -—
arbitrarily se1ected—-—of the Free
Speech Movement. , ’

The student revolt at Berkeley
was a most signiﬁcant happening;
it was also very complex. Nice
black and white formulas( mod-
erate good guys vs. radical bad
guys) don’t apply.

Editor, The Pitt News:

We, as students,_hopeful1y have

W‘ He cited as a classic example

  Po0rAmerican Outlook
I,Harmful Claims Drury

(Continued from Page 1)

With regards to Oversensitivity to World Opinion,
. Drury believed that we “spend more time worrying about
 what other people feel” than is necessary. World ‘opinion is
 -at best ‘a “misinterpreted, will-o-the-wisp” entity which re-
. ceives more__ attention than it deserves. We must realize, said
i Drury,'t'hat “foreign opinion supports the power that tri-

. horsemen is fear, “fear of having

to do something about what._con-
fronts us.” He then asked, “If
that makes the principles of our
country any less valid? If we
are not ready to ﬁght’ for our
way of life, why not give up
right now?” he asked.

“No sane person wants war,”
Drury explained, but by the same
token “no one wants to surrender
his freedoms.” He stated that in
order to retain our freedoms”
we must be ready to give them
up. If we want to live, we must
be ready to die. Only if we are
unafraid of» war can we avoid it.
“Everyone is afraid of war, but
“we must accept the fear .and go
on from there.”

“We saved freedom before,”
said Drury, “and we must save
it. again.” But in order to do so,
he said, we must “look bravely
at the world as it is and not in
timidity and fear as we would’
like it to be. Our principles never
betrayed us before‘ and they won't
betray us now if we have the guts
to stand by them. I

“We must be ﬁrm,” Drury
urged, “but not belligerent. We
must not retreat from what we
know is right, ‘and make agree-

ments just for agreement’s sake. .

We must not give our,mortal_
enemies the easy inch, for it will
later become the irretrievable
mile.” ‘
