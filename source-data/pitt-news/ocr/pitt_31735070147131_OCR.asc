The sought—after and sometimes elusive
female orgasm popped up in a variety
of forms during “The Vagina Mono-
logues” last week. , . .
Simulated moaningfrom orgasms
entertained more than 100 people in
David Lawrence Hall last_weekend
whenanactress demonstrated multiple
ways of voicing the big moment.
Although “machine gun” and_“tor—

tured zen” moans brought comedic ‘

relief, continuedviolence againstwom—
en remained the major theme of the
event. Topics included pubic hair, sex
workers and violence against women
during war. ‘

Campus Women’s Organization
orchestrated the production, which is
based on Eve Ensler’s popularplaythat
addresses female sexuality and abuse.
Different performances covered top-

ics of violence, silence, shame, racism

and sexism.

FraydaCohen,alecturerofanthro—
pology and womens studies, said that
the event is designed to encourage
“frank discussion.”

These discussions can be seen as a ,

mechanism to empower women, said
Cohen, who was not involved with the
Pitt event.‘ _

The intention of the production
is that, behind the recognizable and
possibly controversial name,women’s
voices will reach across campus and

Whenjessica Casey ﬁst pumps twice
aweek to Enrique Iglesias’ “I Like It”
in the dance studio at Trees Hall, she’s
notpracticingforher“Jersey Shore”
audition—she’sworking on her New
Year’s resolution.

The Zumba class taught at the
University helps Casey ﬁilﬁll her
resolution to lose weight through
healthier eatingand increased physi-

. cal activity.

Although Casey, a doctoral stu-
dent at Pitt, has so far stuck to her
NewYear’s resolution, a2008 survey
conducted by Stephen Shapiro and
Opinion Research Corp. indicates
that three out of four people do not
achieve their goals. And 45 percent of
“resolutionaries” don’t even make it

to February. ,

With the bad reputation New
Year’s resolutions have, many have
abandoned what seems like a ﬁitile
endeavor. _ .

_ Freshman Mara Katz instead opts
for monthly and weekly goals. Her
current goal is to resist raisingﬂher
hand so much in-class because not
everyone is going to care about her
opinion. _

“New Year’s Day is kind of ar-
bitrary. I set goals whenever I feel I
‘need to, not when the calendar says
to,” Katz said. “When I feel there’s
somethingl need to focus on, Ifocus
on it.”

In addition, Katz ﬁnds it helpful
to tell other people about her goals.
Having someone else paying atten-
tion and checking up on her makes
it harder for her to neglect her as-
pirations.

Lindsay'Diethorn’s strategy for
success involves  resolutions
with tangible beneﬁts. Resolving to

improvehertime management skills, I
' the thirdyear audiology doctoral stu-

dent now has time to watch her favor-
ite TV shows like “Modern Family”
because she doesn’t procrastinate on

«her school assignments and keeps up

with weekly chores like laundry.
Taking advantage ofher set sched-
ule, Diethom uses her breaks in the
day and free mornings to get work
done, allowing her to stress less at the
end of the day and on weekends.

‘ Like 92 percent of the resolution-
aries in the Stephen Shapiro study,
Diethorn and Casey have both failed
to succeed in their past resolutions.

Megan Turske, a counselor at -

Pitt’s ofﬁce of Disability Resources
and Services who frequently works
with students on goal-setting, said

setting up a successful resolution '
shouldsinclude a back-up plan.
“You need to say to yourself, ‘I’m

' human. I might fail at this. What do I V

do if I_fail?”’ 'I‘urske said.

Turske said people frequently set.
unrealistic timeframes fortheir goals,
causing them to fail. She stressed the
importance of setting small, short-
term goals that will help achieve a
long—term goal. ' V

In addition, she recommends cre- '

ating a goal timeline to breakdown
an overall goal into smaller pieces
to track and reward yourselfas you
progress. Finally, Turske suggests
writing down a list of reasons you
want to achieve that speciﬁc goal so
that youcanreference itwhen you feel
like reverting back to old behavior.
Unlike in the past, Diethorn’s
trying to change a little bit at a time
instead of making outrageously am-

Some keep New Year’s resolutions, othersfailter

A bitious goals. She makes more rea-
’ .sonable to—do lists, and, in return-, is
I rewarded with more free time.

Casey signed up forthe Pittsburgh

Half Marathon in May as away to .

“staple down” her long—term goal of
exercising regularly. _

“I signed upfor it, so I’rn commit-
ted to running it,” she said. “I spent
the money, so I don’t want it to be a
waste.”

Casey currentlytrains for the half
marathon three days a week and at-

tends her Zumba class twice aweek, .

giving her at least ﬁve scheduled
workouts each week. So far, she’s been
rewardedwithweight loss in addition
to more energy, encouraging her to
stay on track with her resolution.

“I feel better when I’m done run-
ning,” Casey said. “That’s my re-
ward.” _I

itsusualtime of11a.in.to3p.m. on
Thursday and during the Prisoner of

L Azkaban showing from 8 to 10 p.m.

that night.

The nonproﬁt group that raises
money to ﬁght world hunger will re-
name its regular sandwiches, giving
them Harry Potter-themed titles for
the event.

The Mexican-themed“FeelBueno”
will be the “Red Hot Hermione,” and
the traditional grilled cheese will be

called the “The Cheese Who Lived.”

The suggested donation is eight
Sickles, a wizarding world currency,
butMuggles, or norimagic people, can
sﬁllpay $3. *

The organization’spresident, Alyssa
Weisenesse,saidthatshewas excitedto
have,FeelGood World participateinthe

Y

eventbecause she loves HarryPotter, as
do several of the other members.

When the ﬁrst part of the seventh
ﬁlm premiered lastfill, the group had
Harry Potter-themed sandwiches and
had Pitt’s  team deliver them
on broomsticks.

“Ihatwas one of our most success-
ﬁil events,” Weisenesse said.

Alt:hough Weisenesse is excited for
Hariy Potter Week, she is concerned
about how rnidterms will affect the
event.

John Hoehn, assistant manager of
the William PittUnion, saidthat activi-
ties have been spread out so that stu-
dents can come and participate when
they have time orwantto relax.

“The reason that we did it now is
thatFebruaryis suchaditlicultmonth,”
said Lauren Merclean, also an assis-

s Place

tant manager of the William PittUnion,
“Springbreak’s around the corner, and
leading up to midterms, people are re-
allystressedoutandwewantedto do
something fun.”

Harry Potter week has been in the
planning process for about a month.
The staff that runs the William Pitt
Union, including the students, helped
work outthe details. Merclean saidthe
idea for Hairy Potter Week came up
when a group of employees metto dis-
cuss events they could hold in Nordy’s
Place Nordy’s Place. I

“We reallywanted to see more stu-

Violence the theme of event

‘Monologues? 4 1

for CWO.
“[The production] crosses barriers: men, wom-

en, professors, students, feminists, activists and .

people who don’tidentifyas any ofthose  are
all included in our audience,” Salamone said.

I “All sorts of people turn outto support us and
be a part of the solution,” she added.

Dylan Drobish, a senior neuroscience and
linguistics major, stood out as the one of the only
men on stage. '

He said he hadseenthe productionthreetimes
previ'ously—this is the sixthtime the production
has beenheld at Pitt— and thathis grlfriend had
beenin it once.

Drobish, who is a female-to—male transgen— »

dered person, participated this year in a mono~
logue about the harassment and abuse ‘faced by

, transsexuals, althoughheself-identiﬁesasqueer,

‘meaning he doesn’t conform to male or female
societal standards. ‘ _

Dressed in a wig and black dress, he said he
understoodlwhat many women go through on
their path to acceptance.

He ﬁnds it ridiculous that some still consider -

the production controversial
“[The vagina] is a part of the body,” Drobish

said. “You see_ men talking about penises all the I
time.” He was also surprised when a male friend

asked him when “balls week” was.

“It’s balls week every week,” he said.

Tracey Hickey, who performed a monologue
about pubic hair, said the production helps break
silence about female sexuality.

“So manypeopleare embarrassed totalkabout

» this stuﬁ‘§”Hickey said. “Like pubichairissupposed

to be completely disgusting and ugly.”
She also thought many Americans think they

are comfortable talking about sex, but still get

squeamish when certain topics are discussed.
This was evident in the audience when one

woman curled up in her seat and cringed during

a performance about child birth. She repeatedly '
V whispered, “Oh, gross.”

“We have a sanitized version of sex,” Hickey
said. . '

One ‘criticism of the original Ensler production
was its Western bias, Cohen said. Both feminist
groups and conservative groups have also been
critical of the production in the past.

“Students are often grappling with the key is-
sues discussed in‘TheMono1ogués,”’ Cohen said.
“And because they stage the production, theycan
makeeditorial choices that reﬂecttheirparticular
interests.” -

Student organizers took this liberty this year
by including a monologue on Haiti, which was
devastated by last year’s massive earthquake.

One monologue was a tribute to feminist ac-
tivist Myriam Merlet, who was killed during the
Haiti earthquake. The actress who performed
the monologue promised to continue the work of
Merlet, especiallybecauseviolence againstwomen
has risen since the earthqua.ke.“N0talot ofpeople
know about the condition that Haiti is in right

now,” Salamone said.
' “Refugee camps are still terrifying places .

without any sort of security, law enforcement is
effectively useless, ‘ and women live from day to
day resigned to the expectation that if they go out

andtrytoﬁnd water, food orwork, theywill have
to fend off attackers,” Salamone said.

Sal_amonesaidthatifHaitianwomen1eavetheir
dauglners alonetoﬁndwater, food oremployment,
their daughters could fall prey to attackers.

The production donated 10 percent of its
proceeds to V-Day, a global activist movement to
stop violence against women and girls. The rest
went to the Women’s Center & Shelter of Greater
Pittsburgh, whose mission is to _end intimate
partner violence in the lives of womenand their
children.   ’

nlllogical funding cuts

for Planned Parenthood

One in ﬁve American women has
received care from a Plarmed Par-
enthood health center during her
lifetime, the organization reports.

Despite what appears to be a
heavy societal reliance on Planned
Parenthood’s services, the House of
Representatives recently approved
an amendment to bar federal fund-
ing for any of the organization’s
activities, according to The Wash-
ington Post. '

Already prohibited from using
federal funding for abortions, the
measure will eliminate funding for
the organization’s other services,
including breast and cervical cancer
screenings, annual exams, family
planning, birth control and HIV
testing.

Although some Republican
agendas deﬁnitely aim to eliminate
what amendment-creator Rep. Mike

Pence calls “on-demand abortions,”-

we think blocking federal aid for pre-
ventative care is an interesting way

; of cutting back on unintended'preg—

nancies thatwarrant abortions. And
by interesting, we mean stupid.

In a news release, the national
branch of Planned Parenthood said,
“The policy  certainly guarantees
an increase in the number of unin-
tended pregnancies. It is difﬁcult

, to understand why people who say

they are opposed to abortion would
do so much to undermine the fam-
ily planning and contraception that
helps prevent the need for it.”
We are equally conﬁised.
According to Pence, “Nobody

is saying that Planned Parenthood

cannot continue to be the largest -

abortion provider in America, but
why do millions of pro-life taxpayers
have to pay for it?” '

But since when does everyone '

have to agree where taxpayer money
goes? For example, taxpayer money
goes toward war efforts regardless
of whether or not the individual sup-
ports them. . I
And the $363 million of taxpayer
money the organization received

last year can’t even be used to pay for 1

abortion services. Plarmed Parent-
hood is clearly “guilty by associa-
tion” for offering abortion services,
despite the other care it provides.
In fact, according to the national
branch of Planned Parenthood,
more than 90 percent of its servic-
es are preventative, like providing
contraception to nearly 2.5 million
patients each year.

Because federal money is already
unable to be used to ﬁind abortions,
we ultimately think that cutting
Planned Parenthood’s ﬁinding was
highly illogical on part of House
Republicans. Instead, the amend-
ment serves to deny preventative
and possibly lifesaving screenings
and health care services to those
who might not be able to afford them
otherwise. ‘

Planned Parenthood currently
has an open letter to House Repre-
sentatives online for its supporters
to sign. Google “I stand with Planned
Parenthood” for more informa-
tion. ". -

'. I used to think blogs were for at-

tention whores. Then I started
one. .
Now I’m sure they’re for at-
tention whores.

More than 100 million blogs
currently exist on the good old
Internet. That’s a lot of whores.

Regardless of whether or not

blogs can be considered legiti-

mate néws sources or whether
they represent our society’s dive
into a dirty, used-Band-Aid-ﬁlled
pool of amateur journalism, blog-
ging deﬁnitely has‘ its advantages
over other writing forms. It also
gives the really huge attention
whores —— ‘we’re talking Kim
Kardashian size, here — another
outlet once they’ve become fed
up with the 140—character limit
of Twitter.

What are these advantages?

Well, for one thing, I’ve already
used the word “whore” four times
in this column. I’m pretty sure
ﬁve is the limit. If I were blogging
on my personal site right now,

I could say whatever obscene
things I wanted without worrying
aboutlan editor removing my hi-
larious jokes about my lady parts
or my bad hygiene practices.

In addition, there is no‘ limit to

write on my blog. Of course, what
many bloggers don’t realize is that
there is a limit as to how much
or how little someone is going
to read. That’s why I often limit

” my blog posts to a title, a single

sentence ‘and a single photo. Ex-
ample: Title — “The one where

some.”. Photo: (Insert really awe—-
some photo of me here).

The length limits and require-
ments of column writing are re-
strictive to the writer and often
wasteful of the reader’s time. This
column, for example, needs to be
at least 4,200-characters—with-
spaces long. I could have summed
up this column in only a few sen-
tences —- “My ‘thoughts are so

Of course, a major plus and
downfall to the “art form” is the

lack of editor. Although you can lg

GOOD GRIEF

Pitt a struggling student in ‘green-ology’.

Mike Good
Columnist

When "I first glanced at my Uni-
versity’s Green Report Card
two years ago, Pitt earned a.C
—— equating to a GPA that reeks
of a disinterested hippie. And, to

. worsen the blow, both Carnegie
Mellon and Penn State earned a'{
letter grade better. In the last two 

" "years, Pitt has taken-many steps

to increase its sustainability that

” have bettered -its standing and_

allowed Pitt to climb‘ to a B minus
— equating to a GPA that sounds
more like a decent student who’s
adjusting to a difﬁcultimajor but
still needs to improve if heorvshe
wants ajob. _ I he ’
Purchased electricity is by
far the greatest contributor
to Pitt’s greenhouse gas emis-

' sions, accounting for 51 percent

of the University’s greenhouse
gas emissions. In this regard,
Pitt currently has few alterna-
tives: existing in the middle of a
city that primarily relies on coal
for electricity limits the amount
of energy that can come from
renewable sources, whereas in
University Park, Pa., Penn State
can pull from more renewable
sources. CMU’s success over Pitt
can likely be attributed to_the
fact that it has a third of Pitt’s
student population. I

Since 2009, Pitt buildings
have installed more efﬁcient light
bulbs, as well as motion sensors
in areas such as the Cathedral
and Market Central, helping to
reduce Pitt’s energy consump-
tion. In addition, the school’s en-
gineers are currently researching
waysto use Pittsbu-rgh’s rivers, in
an environmentally friendly way
to produce energy. .

Pitt has also improved in food
waste and recycling recently. Af-

_ter an initiative spurred by Free

the Planet, one of the Univer-
sity’s leading student groups in

sustainability, campus dining

halls have discontinued dining
trays, which‘ significantly re-
duced waste, from food to wa-

. start small and grow.

For example, what if a few
floors in -resident halls served
as pilots for testing green ini-
tiatives?

wards the floor that used the

also purchased a machine that

processes food waste for Market
Central, which cut waste by.75
percent,»according to a Sustain-
ability at Pitt report.

Although I am just tickled
pretty that these changes have
caused Pitt’s standing in sustain-
ability to improve,_I believe more
significant changes must come
from the ground up. If the Uni-
versitycan lay an infrastructure

least amount of electricity with
pizza or free meal passes/din-
ing dollars. The amount that the
University would save in energy
as the program caught on would
easily offset the cost of rewards
while fostering the community

aspect of dorm life.

‘What if the University donat-
ed high-quality reusable grocery
bags to incoming students and
rewarded them with 10-per-

cent discounts fo_r using them .

atdifferent ongcampus venues?
The program with a 10-percent
discount could be piloted one

dorm floor at a time and then
be assessed to see if the cost
of the project would outweigh
the rewards. If Pitt’s reusable
bags and discount could catch
onto Oakland businesses, those

businesses could also beneﬁt by ' '

spending less on bags.

The effects and results of
such projects tendto snowball.
In Ireland, the government im-
plemented a tax on plastic bags,
requiring retailers to charge the
equivalent of 33 U.S. cents per
plastic bag. The revenue gener-
ated from the tax ﬁnances en-

vironmental programs. Since .

_20o2, plastic bag consumption

has decreased 94 percent and .

the reduction in waste is plainly

visible to visitors, according to .

The New York Times.

Pitt is not the government
of Ireland, and sustainability is
not at the top of its agenda. Its

agenda is-to become an effective .

university. Yet, I am convinced
that engaging in green practices
and becoming pioneers in the
field is not only attainable, but

‘ will also inevitably bolster the

University’s national reputa-
tion, and positively impact its
community and student body.
We need to catch up and out-
perform the schools around us.
CMU recently built the United
States’ ﬁrst Leadership in Energy
and Environmental Design certi-
ﬁed dorm. Pitt must undertake
similar and bigger endeavors and
realize that its responsibility is
not merely to‘ produce better
scholars; it is to produce better
men and women and to improve
the world around it.

Natalie Bell
A&E Editor

There are plenty of bar crawlers in
the South Side on any given Saturday
night, but last Saturday afternoon
there was a different crawl: one for
soup. "

’ From noon to 3 p.m., a bevy of
soup tasters wandered the streets eat-
ingout of special biodegradable bowls
and spoons. They held bright orange
maps inﬂieirghands and "around their
necks  wore royal-blue 
 with c‘a'rds‘that— got punched at

- each stop. Soup locations were scat-

tered from 11th Street to Southside
Works, with orange and red balloons
marking participating shops.

In the 2011 South Side Soup Con-

, test, 25 restaurants served up small

portions of their soup‘ to 1,200 at-
tendees. After taste—testing as many
restaurants as they could, partici-
pants voted on four categories: best
soup, runner—up, best vegetarian and
most creative.

Each restaurant served its soup
inside a different South Side business
to draw attention to both the eatery
and the store or bank.

The South Side Local Develop-
ment Company, a nonproﬁt dedicated
to the area, presented the 7th—annu—
al event and some of the proceeds
beneﬁt the Brashear Association,
a group that sponsors afcer—school
programs for children, senior day
care, job placement services and food
pantries.

That’s why, in addition to the

‘ $14.99 ticket prices, attendees were

asked to bring a nonperishable food
item to restock its food pantry.

In addition to beneﬁting a com-
munity organization, the event also
introduces people to restaurants and
shops they might have passed by or
never had the opportunity to venture
into when hitting the bars.

“It’s a win—win because we’re do-
ing something good forthe neighbor-
hood  It’s also raising money for
the community, it’s also a marketing
opportunity for us,” said Mike Kotyk,
owner of the Over the Bar Bicycle Cafe
on 2518 East Carson St.

Last year, his restaurant’s Magic
Mushroom Soup came in second to
Yo Rita’s Roasted Chestnut Bisque.
This year, the cafe hoped to take ﬁrst
overall in the contest, but instead

won Best Vegetarian for its Cheddar-

Peddlar Brewhaha —— a rich, creamy
combination of tangy cheddar and

. beer produced by Troegs Brewing

Company in Harrisburg.
After last year’s unprecedented
‘crowd of 1,600, the event organizers
decided to capoff the event at 1,200
to be sure they had enough soup for
everyone.
“The problem is it’s a lot of soup,
and it’s a Saturday and that’s one of

the busiest nights of the week to begin ~

with. So to have to prepare soup for
1,200 people,” said _]ennifer]effers,
even committee chair and Brashear
Association board member. “That’s
a lot; that’s a big request  It’s pretty
generous of [the restaurants] to
cookall this soup and take their staff
away.” -

Barbara Baur learned to be more pre-

pared to serve her soup. This year, the

dish she made for the restaurant —-

located at 2339 East Carson St. —was

dish including chorizo sausage and

Swiss chard.

“You think you have so much there
and suddenly the line is so long and
your ladle’s scraping the bottom,” she
said, describing how busy the event
can become.

She served her soup from The
Headboard Shop, an East Carson
Street store selling skateboarding
and snowboarding equipment

The manager, Shawn Watson,
said that though the store’s business
doesn’t necessarily increase the day
of the contest, it does bring awareness
about the shop. As one of the soup

eaters walked out, he iniuired about '

the price of the snowbo
displayed in the shop. ’ g

“I kind oflike the idea of a retailer
and restaurant pairing together 
It’s just something that wouldn’t nor-
mally happen; you usually get soup in
a restaurant,” Watson said.

After the contest, many of the

‘shops involved were full of people

who noticed merchandise while in

East Carson Street that sells clothing
for a young professional crowd, was
full of people after the contest.

“It deﬁnitelybrings people back,”

er. She added that many of the people
who come back after the contest are
people who otherwise might have
passed up the store.

February’s recent cold streak might .

songs section is full of tunes that
sound made for summer. Whether
they’re the kind you’ll want to listen
to is another question.

“Hey Alli”

B-

“Hey Alli” isn’t a work of musi-
cal genius by any means — it has a

‘predictable guitar rift and pretty-

the images of the overly styled band
members on the album ‘cover. It
falls in that vast realm of mediocre
and same—soundin’g-songs.

But all it lacks in originality,
it makes up for in bopping, pop
glory. Q

The lyrics are undoubtedly lame

— “Saysshe wants a_role_ in some
big movie / Or be a.drama queen”
— it’s about the singer being madly
in love with Alli, who is constantly
running from city to city to chase

her dreams. To its beneﬁt, the song -

has those studio—perfected harmo-
nies and upbeat choruses that have
that charmingly irritating quality
of summer radio hits.

It would be a completely and
totally forgettable song if not for
the fact that it’s so damn catchy.

Fashion week hosts outlandish designers

Columnist

Last week, fashion lovers and design-
ers alike came together to celebrate
an iconic holiday: Mercedes—Benz
Fashion Week. Although there were
some new faces, the usual suspects
and the usual fabrics made appear-
ances: Jason Wu, Donr1a Karan and

V   ButI found the; "
more obscure trends.offas'hion-week; ~ t

For example, Marc Jacobs and Thak-
oon offered takes on the exaggerated

hip silhouette popular in the ’40s.'

Thakoon even compared  collec-
tion to the style of dress of Versailles
inMarie Antoinette’s day. _
Jeremy Scott, another designer
known for his boundary—pushing'
trends, didn’t disappoint with his

. brightly colored frocks. Scott even

produced clothing that mimicked

prints from icons in pop culture, like

the Coca—Cola can and the Superman

and Batman emblems.

But even more outrageous was the
collectionfeatured by The Blonds, hus-
' band and wife duo David and Phillipe

Blond. Spikes, sequins, dragons and
rainbow wigs paid homage to the up-
coming Year of the Dragon in2012.
Although the Asian—inspired col-
lectionwas artful and unique, clothing
by designers like The Blonds and]er—
emy Scott are completely unwearable
by anyone — excluding Lady Gaga
and Nicki Minaj. The bright, prints,
sequins and wigs are impractical for
’ even the most adventurous and dar-
ingdressers. 
. This begs the question; Isfashion
becoming exceedingly less accessible
to the averagejane? ~ I

 - :1“ The answer: Absolutely. Haute

couture and whimsical designs can

 ofdollars per~pieceand« T . ..
aren’t even wearable. Dresses from

Herve Leger’s last collection cost up-
wards of $900 and one ofjason Wu’s
dresses from last season cost $2,300.

And those dresses were simple. Add‘

vintage Italian laces and spikes made

of precious metals and the costs rise '

exponentially. Most average women
can’t and won’t want to’ spend three
months’ rent on a dress that can only
be worn once to only one place.
Iunderstand the importance of art
and an artist’s right to express him or

' herselfin anyway. But I wonder, what

happens to all this clothing? ‘

One dress by The Blonds went
mainstream last year. Their spiked-
shoulderdresswaswornbyRihanna,
Kristin Cavallari and Kim Cattrall

a when she starred in “Sex and the City

2.”Accordingto aninterviewwiththe
pair conducted by style.mtv.com, the
dress starts at $5,000 and increases
inprice based on size, alterations and
added embellishments. Even though

i I love The Blonds’ artistry, I have to

play devil’s advocate. Considering our
country’s economic downturn and the
recession, isn’t it irresponsible to man-
ufacture such outlandish clothing? V

thing that’s become impractical in the

Pitt wins second a

EWL title in arow

Mike Furlong
Staﬂ‘ Writer

It took all 10 bouts to decide the
match, but the Pitt wrestling team
was able to secure its second con-
secutive Eastern Wrestling League
Championship Friday night at Ed-
inboro University.

“The guys did a good job,” Pitt
head coach Rande Stottlemyer
said. “We deﬁnitely earned that
win. You know last year was so
special to get the title in our own

gym, but it was special to go to,

their place, too.”

Redshirt senior Ryan Tomei
said the Panthers wrestled well.

“We were really hyped up about
the match,” he said. “We wrestled
a good match. There were maybe a
few bouts I thought that we could
have won. But you know, we were
able to win [the match] .”

Redshirt junior Ethan Headlee
agreed about the team’s perfor-
mance. Headlee added that he was
excited to be a part of the cham-
pionship after watching last year
during his redshirt season.

“It felt really good to actually
be a part of the championship this
year,” Headlee said. “A lot of people
were coming up to me after the
match to ask that question and it
really did feel nice to be a part of
something this season.” 7

The match was an even split
with both the Panthersand Fight-
ing Scots winning ﬁve bouts. each.
But in the end, Pitt outscored Edin-

boro 19-16 by earning four bonus V

points to Edinboro’s one.

“We’ve ‘had a lot of these 5-5
splits,” Stottlemyer said. “But it
does mean something that we can
win a lot of these matches on bonus
points. The guys have been able to
do what they need to do to win.”

Sophomore Anthony Zanetta
got the match started with a Pan-
ther victory. Zanetta picked up a
fall just 18 seconds into the second
period. The victory made the dif-
ference in the team score as Za-
netta earned three bonus points
forjpinning BijanBanks..

“We needed to get a good start
so we needed a lot of points out of

' Zanetta,” Stottlemyer said. “You '

knowthe guy he was wrestling
hasn’t had a great year, so it was
a lot of pressure for him to get a
pin.”

The Panthers won their next
bout at 141 pounds when redshirt
junior Tyler Nauman picked up

a 1-0 decision over Kasey Davis

bringing the score to 9-3 in favor of ‘

the Panthers. Nauman, now ranked
No. 8 in the nation by Intermat, a
leading national amateur wrestling
website., improved to 21-3 on the
season.

“We were kind of hoping Tyler
would be able to get on top of his

- guy and maybe pick up some bonus

points,” Stottlemyer said. “But you

know that guy was a great athlete, "

and Tyler never got a chance to
take him down and get on top. The
important thing is Tyler found a

- way to win; that’s what he’s been

good at.”
At 149 pounds, the Fighting

‘Scots narrowed the lead to 9-6

when No. 18—ranked Torsten
Gillespie defeated the Panthers’
Dane Johnson 8-7 on a late take-
down. Johnson led the match
6-2 entering the third period but
could not hold off the returning
All-American.

The Panthers fought back again
at 157 pounds when redshirt soph-
omore Donnie Tasser picked up
a 7-5 decision over Johnny Gre-
isheimer. Tasser scored a duck-
under takedown with 30 seconds
left in the match, cut his oppo-
nent to allow him to escape and
scored another duck—under to take
the lead. A duck—under is when a
wrestler places his head under his
opponent’s arm in order to get in a
position to take him down.

,“That match at  [pounds]
really might be the turning point
for us,” Stottlemyer siiid. “Donnie
was down by a point  was able

The Pitt wrestling team defeated Edinboro to claim its second consecutive EWL title. The Panthers will
compete in the EWL Individual Championship on March 6.

after a 10-1 major decision victory.
A major decision victory occurs
when a wrestler wins by at least

eight points, but doesn’t reach ,

the 15 point margin needed for a
technical fall. Pitt was awarded one
bonus point for the major decision.
The win gave the Panthers a 16-6
lead. Headlee scored three take-

‘downs and a set of near fall points
on his way to the victory.

“I really felt like I needed to
get some bonus points,” Headlee
said. “I think I went out there and
wrestled a pretty tough match. I
was hoping to get a pin but the ma-
jor decision was pretty nice?’

The Fighting Scots’ pulled the
match toan even 16-16 tie_,after
winning the next three bouts.

Edinlaoroslcored its .dne_ bonus

point on an 11-2 major decision
victory scored by Chris Honeycutt.
Honeycutt, the nation’s top -ranked

wrestler at 184 pounds, defeated .

freshman Max Thomusseit to im-
prove to 24-0 on the season.

Tomei said he had a lot of con-
ﬁdence. in Thomusseit.

-“I_ thought he’d have a shot to
win the match,” Tomei said. “Max
wrestled well, but I know he could
have done a little better. Honeycutt
is a good wrestler, but Max andhim
have the same style: They’re both
big, strong kids. It really comes
down to Honeycutt having a lot
more experience on Max.”

Pitt’s Phil Sorrentino dropped

a tight 1-0 match to fellow senior 0

Shawn Fendone at 197 pounds. The

bout brought the score to the 16-16 ,

tie with only the heavyweight bout
remaining. ‘ «

“Phil’s a real ﬁghter,” Stottle-
myer said. “You know, Phil doesn’t

.win that match, but he’s really a” ‘

guy that creates energy when he
goes out there. He made the match
into a street ﬁght and that really
creates momentum for the guys.”

As he took tothe mat for the

ﬁnal match, Tomei said he felt very -L-

comfortable in the pressure-ﬁlled
position.

“I felt the same way that I al-
ways do; I knew I had to win the
match for the team.” Tomei said. “I
set myself at a higher standard, not

to take anything away from EWL‘

heavyweights, but I’ve wrestled
against better guys, so I know I can

V Pin; 59,. St. John’s 60

When Travonwoodall nailed a3—pointerwith
roughly 10 seconds remaining on the clock to
put the No. 4 Pitt men’s basketball team ahead
59-58, it appeared that the Panthers (24-3, 12-2

. ' Big East) would leave Madison Square Garden

with avictory. .

But St.-John’s (17—9, 9-5 Big East) guard Dwight
Hardy hitanunderhanded layup from alongthe
baselinewith1.2 seconds lefcinlzhe game, giving
the Red Storm a,6o—59 victory and its fifth win
over a top—25 team thisrseason.

“My hopewasto, by March, have adangerous,
opporu1nisu’c team that could beat anybody in
the country that didn’t bringanA—game or if they
overlooked us,” St.John’s head coach Steve Lavin
saidinapost-game press conference. “It appears
we hit thatinlatejanuary and February.” I

Pitt held aﬁve—point lead with 3:20 remain-

, ing after Brad Wanamaker hit a jumper, but the

Panthers wouldn’t make another ﬁeld goal until
Woodall’s 3—pointer, allowing St. Jolm’s to go off
on a 7-0 run.

' “This is one of the toughest losses,” Pitt head
coa_chJamie Dixon said. “I am proud of how we
played and howwe handledthings and executed
the last play; we got the open look and Travon
[W0odall] made a great shot. We put ourselves
in a good position.”

Ashton Gibbs, who had missed the previous
three games with an MCL injury in his left knee,
scored a career—high 26 points coming off the

‘bench and went 6-9 ﬁ'om beyond the arc.

“It felt good and I knew my knee was ﬁne; I
practiced the lastfew days,” Gibbs said. “This was
atough loss because we had so many chances to
win in the last three minutes and we just slipped
up and lost the game on our own.”

Although Gibbs put on a stellar shooting
performance, the other Panthers struggled of-
fensively. Gary McGhee led all Pitt starters with
seven points. ,

. Foul trouble burdened the Panthers through~
outthe game, particularly inthe secondhalf. With
roughly nine minutes left in the game, St.John’s
had already entered the double bonus.

Another downfall of the Panthers came at
the free-throw line. Pitt converted only 10-of-
18 shots from the liné.l5Pitt also turned the ball
over 16 times, but managed to out—rebound St.

John’s 28-27. .

Hardy led the Red Storm with 19 points.
Justin Burrell ﬁnished with 15 points and eight
rebounds, and Pittsburgh native D.J. Kennedy
added 11 points and seven rebounds.

“Itwas great,” Kennedy, a senior, said about
thewin. “Greatestfeeljng since I’ve [had] here [at
St. John’s]. Great to get the opportunity to beat
them and go back home and say I beat them.”

go out there and control the match.”

In the ﬁnal dual meet of his collegiate
career, Tomei faced redshirt freshman Er-
nest James. Tomei scored a 3-0 decision
ov,erJames to earn the Panthers their second
consecutive title. Tomei’s victory was his
103rd of his career. '

Stottlemyer said Tomei, an experienced
wrestler, performed well.

“You know his guy is a pretty good,wres4
tler,” Stottlemyer said. “There was no take-
down in the ﬁrst period but Ryan rode him
on top in the second  You know it’s one of
those matches where the score seems close,
but he controlled the match,”

After the victory Stottlemyer praised
assistant coaches Jason Peters and Matt
Kocher. .

“The staff has done a great job,” Stottle—
myer said. “We were well—prepared, the team
has really bought into it. It’s hard to not give

credits staff

a lot of credit to these guys.”

Looking ahead, the Panthers have the
EWL individual championship on March 6
at Bloomsburg University. Pitt hopes to win
the conference tournament for the ﬁrst time
in team history.

“I think the goalfor us is to win the tour-
nament,” Tomei said. “We’ve never won the
EWL tournament, so that’s been a goal forus

- and I think ‘it’s our year to do it..I know for

me I want to see us qualify all 10 wrestlers
for Nationals, and I think that’s something

, that we have a chance to do.”

After the EWL tournament the Panthers
have the NCAA Championships in Phila-
delphia beginning on March 17. For an in-
dividual to qualify for Nationals, he must
place in the top four at the EWL tournament
or apply for an at-large bid. _ _

Ultimately, the No. 20 Mountaineers (21-6,
7-6 Big East) proved too much for the Panthers
(13-13, 5-8 Big East) to handle and defeated Pitt
by.a score of 90-79. Pitt defeated West Virginia
in Morgantown earlier this season.

“We haven’t given up 60 points in over a year.

In the ﬁrsthalf, West Virginia nearly doubled
Pitt’s shot attempts, taking28 shots to Pitt’s 17.
The Mountaineers led 45-30 at the close of

V the ﬁrst half, capitalizing on Pitt’s 10 ﬁrst-half '

“I want to compliment West Virginia; they
played reallywell. In theﬁrsthalfthey really took

coach Agnus Berenato said. “I felt like we dug

Pitt could not seem to close the gap much

With four minutes remaining in the game,
Taneisha Harrison caught ﬁre. She seemed to?
takethe game into her ownhands and cutthe‘
lead to eight points. But that was as close as Pitt
would come to the Mountaineers.

Harrison ﬁnished with 28 total points.

“[Taneisha] is playing really, really well forus

Throughout the second half, West Virginia 4
