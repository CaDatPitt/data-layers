intoa new

kind Of SempleFest

Olivia Garber
Staﬂ" Writer

Pitt students attempted to continue
the F*ck Finals Friday tradition, a
night traditionally lauded as the
pinnacle of drunken college de-
bauchery.

Regaled with stories of Dump-
ster ﬁres and crowded streets, I, a
SempleFest virgin, had high expec-
tations for the evening.

Before I even had time -tothink
“This is it?” SempleFest was over.

SempleFest 2010 was aﬁgurative

' two-pump chump, leaving some stu-

dents feeling a little dissatisﬁed.
4:30 p.m.

My ﬁrst glimpse of SempleFest
began with a crowd of about eight

ofﬁcers standing at‘ the corner of .

Semple and Louisa streets.
“Somehow, they’re pondering
how to get us,” Pitt senior Jackie
Eagle said. ~ '
Police on the scene declined to

comment and instead ‘directed all _

questions to a commander who
would be available today. Arrest
and citation statistics would also
be available today, ofﬁcers said. A

Eagle was one of about 20 stu-
dents drinking at Pitt senior Dave
Raffensperger’s place on Semple.
Raffensperger said all the people
drinking at his house were 21 or
older.

Raffensperger had laid out cau-
tion tape lining where party—goers
could stand if they did not want

open container violations. L
Like a couple ﬁghting in.a bad
sitcom, the students stayed on their
side of the line, the police on the
other. ', .
One student mourned the out-

come.

-“SempleFest died last year,” he
Said.‘ °

Devon McGee, a 21-year-old Pitt

senior, held what he called some-
thing “between a shindig and a
gathering” during SempleFest, his
ﬁrst time hosting.

McGee, who received a'note

from the police warning Semple

Street dwellers about the conse-
quences of SempleFest earlier last
week, was a little resentful of the
police treatment. ~

“It’s a bit ridiculous we get tear
gassed on our own campus and can’t
have a party,” McGee said.

McGee said he only allowed close

friends who were 21 and older in his _

residence.

Raﬁ'ensperger’s get—together was
structured similarly, although he
had a more positive opinion of the
police, saying that the police were
“understanding and grea .”

Although he was a little disap-
pointed with the turnout, Raffen-
sperger, who is 21, said he and his

2 friends could always go to the bars

if SempleFest turned out to be a
dud.

“It’s beer pong — it’s nothing
too crazy. That’s what SempleFest
should be about —-— chilling, friends,

nothing too rowdy,” Raffensperger

said.
As I ventured ﬁirther down

Semple"Street, I trailed behind

. two police ofﬁcers, carrying clip-

boards stocked with blank citation
papers.

Although the police told me
they weren’t allowed to comment
on SempleFest, one police officer
mentioned that the students were
being “good” this year.

Shawna Kelly, a_ 20-year-old
Pitt sophomore, wasn’t thrilled
about the extra police force on her
block. a

“People on Semple are having
get-togethers. It’s not what police
are making it out to be,” she said.

Kelly added that the activities
happening at SempleFest occur ev-
ery weekend.

“It’s one day out of the year .

they are enforcing the rules,” Kelly
said. .

Two years ago, SempleFest was
an out-of-control party turned-riot
that ended with 18 arrests. The most
common charges were public drunk-
enness and underage drinking.

SempleFest-goers set Dumpsters
and couches on ﬁre, requiring the
presence of ﬁre trucks.

10 p.m.

I gave SempleFest a few hours to
regenerate, thinking that round two
would be more eventful.

The-street was darker,'the air
was rank with cheap keg beer and
there were a few more people gath-
ered, but otherwise, SempleFest was
largely as Ihad left it.

Down the block, less than a

dozen porches had people. Raﬁ'en-

  Breakin

huttle driver Joanne Glinski

passes aproblematic bridge at
- the intersection of Bates Street
and Second~Avenue nine times a day
on her routes.
“Not a day goes by that a truck
doesn’t get stuck there,” she said,
reﬂecting on her two years driving
shuttles. “Nine times out of 10, that’s
the because of congestion, unless
, [the Parkway East] is backed up.”
The Bates Street bridge is a no-
torious traﬂic problem that causes
tie-ups that can sometimes stretch
for miles. Drivers of standard-sized,
13—feet—6-inch tractor-trailers, of-
ten realize too late that they.can’t
make the 11-foot-6-inch clearance
and subsequently scrape the top of
their vehicles. But after decades of
commercial vehicle accidents, the
city expects to replace the battered
bridge this summer.
Using $3.6 million of city, state

and federal funds, the city will re-
place the old railroad bridge with
a taller, wider bridge, said Chuck
McClain, the city’s project manag-
er for bridges and structures. The

, new bridge will accommodate the ,

proposed Mon/ Fayette Expressway
into Oakland + and 17-foot-6-inch
talltrucks. -

Bridge construction was sup-
posed to start this spring, but con-
ﬂicting requirements of two fed-
eral funding sources pushed back
the construction. McClain said in

' a follow-up e-mail that he hopes

construction will begin in mid-
summer. '

The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad
built the bridge in the early 1900s,
and the Rails-to -Trails Conservancy
converted it for pedestrian use near
the end of tlie century.

The city acquired the bridge.

from PennDOT about 20 years ago,

and because car drivers don’t use it,
ofﬁcials don’t give it high priority,
McClain said. ‘

“If the bridge was not part of the
Mon/ Fayette Expressway, I doubt if

we would be replacing it,” he.said_.g_. .,

The Mon/Fayette Expressway is
a part of a larger project commis-
sioned by the Pennsylvania Turnpike

_ that will‘ connect Pittsburgh with

Morgantown, W.Va.
The new bridge will also help alle-
viate rush—hour traﬂic on Bates Street

because its proposed design allows '

for ﬁve lanes of trafﬁc, compared to
the existing three lanes. There will
be two lanes leading into_Oakland
and three exiting Oakland.

On both sides of thebridge, there
are dented steel beams that were
once shielded by concrete. White
paint lines show where trucks trav-
eling down Bates Street scraped the
bridge. ‘

Before Barnes became a shut-
tle driver, he helped repair “can-
opened” trucks. He said it cost be-
tween $20,000 to $30,000 to drill
out the rivets and repair one of the
trucks in the 1990s, when he worked

.on them.

Though a truck might be saved
aﬁer scraping a bridge, a driver’s
record typically can’t be repaired.

“They really want guys with clean
driving records. If you make one big
mistake like tearing a top off a trac-
tor, you’ll be out on the street,” he

‘ said.

2 Pitt students compete for ‘Glee’ spots

Gwenn Barney
Staff Writer

One in 533. Sue Sylvester would
say the odds are of a Pitt student
becoming a “Glee” cast member
look just about as good as Will
Schuester’s hair. Despite these
slim chances, sophomore Nina
Starner and junior Dashanna
Terry have answered the call
for “Glee’s” open auditions on
MySpace.

The open auditions, which
began March 30 and end at 2:59
p.m. today, aim to ﬁnd three new
cast members for the television
show “Glee.” To be eligible for
the contest, Starner and Terry
had to submit a one—minute per-
sonal statement and a four-min-
ute song performance through
Myspace. People can View the
performers’ submissions online
and give them a “gold star” if they
feel Glee’s executive producers,
the contest’s judges, should take
their performances seriously.

Terry and Starner had to
choose which song to perform
from a list of 10 numbers done
in past episodes of the show.
Both chose the same song, Amy
Winehouse’s “Rehab,” but their
auditions tell the tale of two very
different talents.

A True Star(ner)

Nina Starner’s audition begins
with her standing in a room ﬁlled
with mirrors. The mirrored walls
give the video a dramatic feel,
but then Starner’s always had a
propensity for the dramatic.

Though a singer, dancer and
actress for much of her life,
Starner has always loved acting
best. “I like the process of trying
to ﬁgure out how to take on your
character,” she said. Starner, who
is currently minoring in theater
arts and ﬁlm studies, has a lot of
experience with taking on roles
that don’t necessarily ﬁt her per-
sonality. ‘ -

Three summers ago, she
played Mimi in the Philadel-
phia-based MacGufﬁn Theatre
8: Film Company’s production of
Rent. Often described as “sweet”
by family and friends, she sur-
prised audiences with her ability
to covincingly step into Mimi’s
heroin-dealing, exotic dancing
character.

“I cast her against type,” said
John Rea, the play’s director. “She
pulled off the character without

!‘%‘~3‘-

- ».-z~i’
&-auzzraaeazb-sivivi

feeling like she was miscast.”

This ability to adapt on stage
will serve Starner well if she is
cast by “Glee,” one of her favorite
shows. She has been a “Glee” fan,
often known as a “Gleek,” from
the very first episode.

“The ‘Glee’ soundtrack is on a
continuous rotation in my car,”
she said. “I’ve seen [the episode]
“Sectionals” like 70 times,” she
said, referring to the show’s last
episode before its winter break.

Despite her extensive Glee
knowledge, Starner didn’t learn
about the open auditions until
her father sent her an e-mail in
February.

She let the idea sit for a while
before deciding to go for it.

“I just ﬁgured, ‘Why not?’”
she said.

In the personal statement of
her audition, Starner describes
feeling like an underdog in high
school. At her small school in
Philadelphia, the theater depart-
ment was not very popular with
the student body, very much like
The New Directionals glee club
on the show. Starner was able to
throw herself into theater any-
way, and by doing so, stopped
caring about the stigma associ-
ated with the performing arts.
She believes having this experi-

ence helps her relate to the char-
acters on Glee.

“I was working on three shows
at once junior year,” she said.
“I stopped caring what people
thought because I was so busy
with theater.” J

She practiced singing “Rehab”

accompaniment that he provides
for the audition.

Jamison and Starner ﬁnally
ﬁlmed the song April 19 in one
of the Music Building’s practice
rooms.

“When she was singing, she
was very conﬁdent,” Jamison

said. “She didn’t shy away.”

Though he is aware of the
tough odds involved in being
selected for the show, Jamison
still feels Starner could add a lot
to the cast.

“She’s deﬁnitely enthusias-
tic about the show,” he said, “so

she’ll bring a lot of enthusiasm

to the set.”

Starner isn’t getting her hopes
up too high.

“I have no idea what my chanc-
es are,” she said. “They’re prob-
ably slim, but at least I tried.”

Starner will still remain a

Gleekeven if she is not added to

the cast. She has already bought
tickets for “Glee Live” at Radio
City Music Hall next month.

“We should be able to see their
faces from our seats,” Starner
said with a smile.

With a little luck, she’ll be a
lot closer to the Glee cast soon
enough.

New adviser lets activist groupstay at Pitt  

Students for a Democratic Society, amid tensions between the University and community, hasn’t let controversy stop them

Richard Rosengarten
Staﬁ"Writer

Forty-two years ago, much was
different.

Eighteen-year—olds fought to
vote. The Vietnam War claimed
lives. Young people feared the
draft.

University students faced
different issues from a different
time. And yet, in many ways,
much has remained the same.

Events in recent weeks involv-
ing Pitt’s chapter of Students
for a Democratic Society echoes
’60s-era controversy. Some of
it pressing, legitimate. Some of
it contrived. All of it alive with
passion and disagreement—ger-
mane to a decades—old history of
Pitt SDS controversy.

Just over a week ago, Pitt SDS
ofﬁcerjordan Romanus canceled
Pitt’s sponsorship of Pittsburgh
Freedom School,,a national SDS
conference. Romanus had spoken
with Student Life Director Ke-

nyon Bonner about worries over
the event’s content, and history
professor Tony Novosel stepped
down as SDS adviser..

Dick Oestreicher, just one
letter away from Novosel on the
History Department’s list of fac-
ulty, agreed last week to be the
new SDS adviser, and the group
will keep its presence at Pitt.

People on campus, and on
Twitter and Facebook, were sus-
picious and alarmed by campus
radicals and the radical things
they might do. PittBrieﬂy pub-
lished articles saying SDS is “open
to outside influence,” claiming
the existence of a “shadow fac-
tion” within the group, working
to accomplish aicircumspect
agenda.

Return to the ’6os.

SDS had grown in national
prominence since a 1965 March
on Washington to End the War in
Vietnam. From the group’s 1905
antecedent, the Intercollegiate
Socialist Society, SDS branched
and grew to have national chap-

ters and members numbering in
the tens of thousands.

‘They wanted to abolish the
Selective Service System, accord-
ing to The Pitt News’ archives. It
believed the political structure of
the United States privileged few
and disadvantaged many. They
were against Vietnam War. They
were — and are — activists, out
for social justice and a purely
democratic society.

And then, as now, SDS made
people nervous. SDS mem-
bers balked at media coverage.
Whether or not they tried, they
attracted attention.

SDS was involved in the 1968
Columbia University protests --
an ugly, violent affair, involving
building occupation and forcible
removal of students by the New
York City Police Department.
People thought of Columbia when
they thought of SDS.

On Pitt’s campus that year,
SDS distributed anti-ROTC ﬂi-
ers, spoke against alleged Uni-
versity censorship and unfair

media bias.

As SDS grew active, students
grew reactive, and spoke about
the “subversive radicals,” fearing
another incident like the one at
Columbia.

Paul Stoller, then-editor of
The Pitt News, wrote, “SDS has
become the whipping boy of all
students believing in national
plots to disrupt the campuses of
the nation.”

To look today at the recent
SDS controversy is to see a like-
ness — events playing out much

as they did in‘ ’6os, for familiar =

reasons.

Romanus canceled sponsor-
ship of the Pittsburgh Freedom
School after he and Bonner dis-
cussed worries over its content.
There were supposed to be ses-
sions called “Confronting Police
Brutality” and “Dismantling Op-
pression.” One workshop was
pegged to help attendees learn
and practice “street marches”
and “building occupation,” the
Pittsburgh Freedom School’s Fa-

cebook page says.

SDS made people nervous
again. V

Before the SDS event, in the
fingernail-biting over “shadow

factions” and‘ “anarcho-insur-

rectionists,” University ofﬁcials,
students and others assured that
history did repeat itself —— in
similar language and for reasons
that have not changed much in
40 years.

The group’s aversion to media
is as chronicled as it is unsur-
prising. ' -

In a 1968 national SDS con-
ference in Boulder, Colorado,
the group refused to allow cam-
eras or recorders into meetings,
sparking a frenzy of controversy,
and tension between the Univer-
sity President and Regentjoseph
Coors of the Coors beer family.

Now, as then, students leveled
a litany of bias and falsehood.al-
legations against campus media
—— today The Pitt News and Pitt
Brieﬂy. Some might be justified.

Authorities question legality of unpaid internships

Mollie Durkin
Staﬁ" Writer

Attention, interns: Not getting paid
for routine coffee runs and copy
making might not just be a pain..
It might also be illegal.

State labor officials in Oregon,
California and other states are
cracking down on unpaid intern-
ships. Some employers have even
been ﬁned for violating minimum
wage laws for the unethical treat-
ment of interns, according to the
U.S. Department of Labor, sparking

a nationwide discussion about how I

much unpaid work is too much.

Interns are often afraid to ﬁle
complaints because they don’t
want to cause trouble, Ben Brat-
man, an associate professor of legal
writing at Pitt’s law school, said.
They might also fear that getting
ahead without the internship will
be impossible.

“This is the reality that always
exists with issues in the employ-
ment setting,” Bratman said.
“Whether it’s an intern, a trainee
or an applicant, employees are un-
likely to complain about potential
violations because they fear retali-
ation from superiors, or developing
a reputation that isn’t going to help
their long—term advancement.”

Bratmansaid it is important
for interns to know what is legal
and what is not, so they can dis-
tinguish if they are treated fairly
-— and legally. He said there are
many gray areas when it comes to
unpaid internships, but there are
still a few rules for interns to keep
in mind. '

“If someone is labeled as an em-

ployee, then they have to be paid
at least minimum wage,” Bratman
said. ‘

He added that employers can
classify interns as “trainees,” and
if they do, they don’t have to pay
them. _ . A

, To clarify the issue, the Depart-
ment of Labor’s Wage and Hour
Division created a set of six criteria
under the Fair Labor Standards Act
that distinguishes employees from

cases, employers beneﬁt. quite
a lot from trainees. For interns,

the line between “employee” and‘

“trainee” might not be so clear. He
added'that the practical and legal

concerns of interns go hand—in-

h'and. ‘

“If an intern agrees to be unpaid

up front, then I would say it’s im-
portant that the number of hours
he or she is going to work is estab-
lished,” Bratman said. “Don’t go in

A person is not considered an-employee if:

eration of the acilities of t e employer, is similar

trainees. The Department of Labor
released a statement earlier this
month elucidating these criteria
for employers and colleges (see
related chard).

If the person passes each of
these criterion, then he or she
does not bear the legal label of
“employee” and does not have to
be compensated.

_ Bratman said that, in many

without knowing that up front.”
He added that an unpaid intern
should make sure there is supervi-
sion and an opportunity to learn
and grow, as well as the possibil-
ity of moving into a paid position.
If an intern is considered to be a
trainee, he should not be hit with
unexpected overtime or any of the
tasks that should be carried out
by an employee, he said.-He said

trainees should receive some sort

- of training and be performing work-

conducive to theirlearning experi-
ence, like shadowing employees.
“If you’re not getting training
of any kind, then the internship is
dubious,” he said.
' As the line between trainee and
employee becomes fuzzy, it also be-

comes wider. Since unpaid interns ~

are not considered employees, they
do not reap the beneﬁts that em-
ployees do.

Bratman explained that train-
ees, as well as volunteers and in-
dependent contractors, are not
substantially protected from em-
ployment discrimination. He said
a trainee with concerns should ap-
peal to the Department of Labor
if he thinks his rights have been
violated. , -

Bratman said the Department‘ _
of Labor operates by the Fair Labor .

Standards Act, but labor laws can

be reﬁned at the state level.
Pennsylvania operates by the

Fair Labor Standards Act, but Brat-

. man said some western states, es-

pecially California, tend to have
employment-related statutes that

are much more protective of em- '

ployees. For example the minimum
wages in California and Oregon are
$8 and $8.40, respectively. When
compared with Pennsylvania’s
minimum wage of $7.25, one can
see the stricter laws at work. ,

sign major at the Pratt Institute

LoW—key fest doesn’t hold u

SempleFest< 2

sperger’s place was the largest, with
about 30 people.

Raffensperger and friends
tapped ﬁve and a half kegs and only
had one run—in with the police. Of-
ﬁcers asked them to turn down their
speakers.

Raffensperger said they weren’t
allowed to have. “ampliﬁed music.”

The police said, “Take it down or -

we’re going to ID all of you,” Raffen—
sperger said.

Raffensperger complied and
said they didn’t receive any more
complaints from the police, who he

. called “more than respectful.” ‘

“The Pitt police have been great.
People got out of hand last year. [The
police] are concerned foryour safe-
ty. That’s their biggest concern,”
Raffensperger said.

Kelsey Happel, a 19-year-old ‘

Pitt sophomore and Semple Street
resident, received a note from police

that warned Semple Street dwell-
ers not to play loud music and to
refrain from standing on sidewalks
and rooftops. -

Happel’s “party” was more of a
“social gathering of close friends
that just happened to be on Semple
Street,” she said. _

The low—key gathering was one
of the last on the block, and it could
be one of the last traces of SempleF-
est. ‘ '

Happel is part of the younger
generation trying to carry on the
tradition of SempleFest. She doesn’t
think it will return its reputation
from days of old.

“It would be great if [our genera- ’

tion] could, but I don’t think any-
thing is going to happen,’_’ Happel
said.
“I don’t want it to just fade away,”
Happel said. '
Fade it did.

p to SempleF est tradition

As I made my way back to 
Avenue, I was amazed at the trans-
formation of Semple Street. There
were no rambunctious drunks, no
couches on ﬁre —- only red cups,
an occasional game of beer pong
and Lady Gaga playing softly from
abalcony. ‘

. I had anticipated debauchery but
saw maturity. In the end, SempleF—
est 2010 sputtered out like the last
drops out of a keg. ;

Despite technology, trucks still strike bridge

Bridge 4 4

I the bridge.

Barnes disagrees.

“They should have that much
more marked —— perhaps something
ﬂashing. That’s a steep hill. If you’re
in the wrong gear, it’s very hard to
get that geared down. Breaks won’t
do it,” he said. “If you got a full load
on you, you’re not stopping with
breaks. You’re not stopping. You’ll
turn them to jelly.”

Barnes said the problem is more
driver error than signage.

“It’s usually a rookie that doesn’t
know the area and is day-dreamin ”
he said. ‘

These inexperienced drivers
might mistake their heights, but an
experienced driver wouldn’t have
this problem. -

“When you’re assigned a truck,
basically it’s your truck until it breaks
down,” he said.

Clayton Boyce, spokesman for

the American TruckingAssociations
in Washington D.C., agreed truck

drivers typically work for compa- ‘

nies, grocers or manufacturers and
drive the same routes. Many truck-
ers work for independent contrac-
tors who send them into unfamiliar
areas. ’ '
Trucking companies use special
GPS units made by Qualcomm and

PeopleNet to help warn truckers -

about low bridges and tunnels, as
well as weight restrictions and steep
hills that aren’t safe forcommercial
vehicles. °

McClain said truck designs grew
larger over the past few decades, but
the bridge’s clearance was a problem

0 even before truck heights increased

after World War 11.

When a truck gets stuck under
the Bates Street bridge, sometimes
it takes hours to pry the truck out
and causes a few miles of trafﬁc

congestion.

Bob McGarm, a partner in Mc-
Garm and Chester Towing, said a lot

.of that time involves unloading the

two to three truck mishaps there
each week.’

David Pritt, safety press oﬂicer

It's usually a rookie that doesn’t
know the area and is day-dreaming.

truck’s cargo and deﬂating tires. If a
truck can’t back out immediately, the
city of Pittsburgh contacts McGarm
and Chester — which has a contract
with the city — to help get trucks
unstuck. ‘

In, these situations, police help
direct traffic, but there doesn’t seem
to be an accurate record of truck ac-
cidents in the area. V

Jim Struzzi, spokesman for

- PennDOT, and Tom Jacques, an

officer from the city’s Commercial

for PennDOT, found ﬁve accidents
in PennDOT’s records in the last ﬁve
years. The fact that only major ac-
cidents are reported to PennD‘OT
explains the low number of acci-
dents. S

“It’s pretty sporadic from what
I gather,” Pr-itt said, sounding sur-
prised when heard the City’s Com-
mercial Vehicle Enforcement Unit
estimated two to three accidents per
week at the location. Pritt’s search
found that truck drivers were cited

three times in 2004 and 2006 for
violating a traffic code, which re-
quires “obedience to trafﬁc—control
devices.” One other’ citation was for
“careless driving,” and in 2007, a

- driver involved in an accident wasn’t

cited.

. Glinski said she usually doesn’t
see police on the scene when a truck
runs into the bridge. She added that
she tries to leave the area before traf-

_ﬁc at the intersection worsens.

She wonders why truckers con-
tinually try to go under the bridge.
Her theory was that truckers might
expect the posted clearance to be

' lower than the actual clearance to

account for snow on the road. .

McGann, the tow-truck profes- ,_
sional, said the advertised clearance _

at the bridge offers alittle leeway, but

, the difference is inches, not feet.

“Yeah, they don’t make it,” he
said with a laugh.

Glee < 6 A

Glee hopeful could bring soul to show’s pop sound

with the iced beverage. “People
actually came and watched [show
choir] sing,” Terry said.

She has carried her love of per-
forming pop songs in show-tune
style to Pitt, where she performs
with and is president of the cam-
pus a capella group, Sounds of
Pleasure. In the group, members
have to audition for solo parts.
Terry feels the experience she

has gained auditioning for solos S

beneﬁtted her audition for the
Glee casting call.

' “It’s super—competitive,” she’

said of show choir competition.

“It’s like a sport for people who
can’t play sports.”

This semester, Terry won
what she called an especially
memorable solo for a Sounds of
Pleasure concert. She sang Boyz
II Men’s “IfI Ever Fall in Love
Again.” The emotional and soul-
ful rendition of the song earned
her resounding applause from
the audience.

“It was probably her best
solo,” said Sounds of Pleasure’s
artistic director Katie Houston.
“She put a lot of emotion into
it.”

Terry said she can inject

‘emotion into her performanc-

es because she can understand
the message a singer is trying
to communicate. “If I Ever Fall
in Love Again,” forexample, is
about heartbreak.

‘‘I’ve been heartbroken be-
fore,’’ she said, “so I know what
that feels like.” ,

But she asserts that under-
standing the lyrics isn’t the only
key to performing a good cover
of a song. Terry always tries to
add her own style to the songs
she sings. '

Though she has been singing
in show choir for seven years,
Terry did not jump on the Glee
bandwagon until recently when
friends recommended she watch
the show. Over the course of a
month she worked her way

through every episode of the.

first season so that she would be
caught up for the show’s spring
premiere on April 13.

“It’s fun to watch,” she said.

Junior Dave Herlich, a friend
of Terry’s who has seen the au-
dition video, feels thatshe can
add something special to the Glee

cast. “It seems most of thevoices l

on the show are very pop—y.” he
said. “She can bring real vocal
power to the show.”

Terry chose to sing “Rehab”
in her audition video because.she
liked its jazzy sound. For several
years she has frequented the jazz
club scene in both Washington,‘
D.C., and Pittsburgh, occasionally
singing on stage in the clubs. ~

“Singing is the best way I can

express myself,” she said. “I can’t -

draw. I can’t play an instrument
to save my life. This ismy natu-
ral gift.”

SDS<8

tion” named in the Pitt Brieﬂy
article, spoke at last week’s SDS
meeting. In jest he asked the
group whether he was “infil-
trating” them, and a collective
response of laughter followed.
And in spite of the pre—event
aspersions, SDS carried out their
Pittsburgh Freedom School in
different buildings than origi-
nally planned, and nothing was
broken. No buildings were oc-
cupied, nor were illegal actions
taken against the community.
During-last week’s meeting, A
Romanus asked reporters to
leave for a few minutes. He and
SDS remains reticent about what,
if any, actions they plan to take
with respect to the University fol-
lowing the recent controversy.
Romanus would say only that
they have “lightly” discussed with
the ACLU “what rights we have as
a student organization.”
“We’re not making any‘ action
yet,” he said. ' ,
Much is different today.
Pitt’s SDS chapter has dimin-
ished since 1968,,when the group
had Pitt office space and boasted

SDS: No action ye

a regular meeting attendance of
60-plus. '

And much today remains the
same. '

SDS members protested with
Sodexo union hopefuls, success-
fully carried out the Pittsburgh
Freedom School conference,.and
will host a sweatshop awareness
program April 27 at. the August
Wilson Center'Downtown.

Pitt’s chapter is still active,
gives members equal say, rejects
the idea of individual leadership,
balks at media and attracts at-
tention, whether they try to or
not. .
Forty—two years ago, a Pitt
SDS member said, “If certain
self—appointed censors will grant
us the right to assemble and a
little freedom of speech, an active
chapter of Studentsfor a Demo-
cratic Society is likely to become
a reality at the University.”

Whatever the future of Pitt’s

‘SDS holds, the group continues

to achieve, ‘fail, and grow and

1 reaction, resentment and con-

troversy will certainly be close
at hand.

Be conscious
of the retouch

rom what appeared to be
Fa botched retouch job of

Demi Moore on the Decem-
ber 2009 cover of W to the BBC
documentary “My Supermodel
Baby,” which revealed that even
model babies have their fat rolls
airbrushed away, Photoshopping
has dominated the media for the
past year.

Interestingly enough, recent
headlines have focused not on ex-
cessive photoshopping but a lack
of photoshopping.

The most recent celebrity trend
seems to be releasing un—Photo—
shopped pictures, and many people
are applauding these celebrities’
decisions for promoting more real-
istic standards of beauty. Harper’s
Bazaar recently ran a piece called
“The Naked Truth: Celebrities, Un-
retouched,” which featured Kim
Kardashian naked and un-photo-
shopped. In addition,Jessica Simp-
son appeared on the May cover of
Marie Claire without makeup or
image enhancement.

Probably snagging the most me-
dia attention, however, was Britney
Spears, who had her raw Candies
advertisement photos released side
by side with the edited ones. Seeing
a healthy but imperfect pink biki-
ni—clad Britney Spear’s next to her
drastically altered near—perfection
self, made many people wonder
whether photo adjustment has
gone too far.

The aesthetically enhanced
Spears appears without bruises,
tattoo-less and without cellulite —
acceptable retouches. The drastic
slimming of her thighs and already
small waist, in addition to the to-
tal reconstruction of her backside,
however, caused concern that ed-
ited images create unrealistic stan-
dards for young men and women.

It’s possibly promoting not shoes,
but eating disorders and unhealthy
self-images.

This is nothing new.

Last year, politicians in France
even pushed for legislation that
would require publishers, through
its department of health, to note
whether or not a photo was re-
touched, according to an article
in the Huffington Post.

But aren’t all photos retouched?
It seems easier to assume that all
images are retouched and instead
state when an image has not felt
the airbrush.

There really isn’t anything
shocking about an edited photo.
Our society prefers its products
—— and its people ——- to be polished
and perfected, so photos wouldn’t
be any different.

You wouldn’t pay for a maga-
zine that didn’t edit and perfect its
articles, so why would you pay for
unedited photos?

While it might not be entirely
necessary for magazines and adver-
tisers to make thin models appear
even thinner — like in the case of
Ralph Lauren model Filippa Hamil-
ton, who was Photoshopped to the
point of her hips appearing slimmer
than her head — or to airbrush the
fat rolls off babies, they’re simply
trying to sell a product, not to pro-
mote false images of beauty.

And as for consumers, we just
need to be aware that the real thing
never looks as good as the adver-
tisement. We all know the burger
you get at McDonald’s never re-
sembles the one you see on the
billboard, so consumers just need
to be aware that Britney Spears,
as well as other celebrities and
models, aren’t actually as ﬂawless
as they appear in their photos. Be
conscious about it.

Despitewhat ﬁlms show,
nerds know no fear

 
   

Mark Kozlowski
Columnist

Strolling through a Best Buy a
few months ago, I couldn’t help
but look through some of what
passes for comedy in our mod-
ern era. The backs of the DVDs
described plots that were rather
sparse in both the character de-
velopment and clothing depart-

. ments. The “screamingly funny”

ﬁlms looked more like they were
cringingly embarrassing. One of
the ﬁlms that especially caught
my eye was titled something like
“I Love You, Sarah Connor” —-
the name changed for humorous
and memory reasons ——- and had
a plot that seemed both typical
and depressing. ,

The idea is, a high-school vale-
dictorian and stereotypical movie
dork has a secret crush on the

most popular girl in the grade and
decides the best way to inform
the young lady in question is to
inform the rest of the graduat-
ing class simultaneously, in his
valedictory speech. Then, that
night, the girl shows up with her
BFFs and converts the poor sap
into a cool kid, and everybody’s
happy-

Sounds pretty typical, no?
Nothing to get excited about par-
ticularly. But the plot irritated me.
First, it discourages hard work in

school, lest you be considered un-

hip. Further, the ﬁlm promotes
the idea that all nerds secretly
want to be cool and are unfulﬁlled
because of their nerdiness. This
second idea is completely false.
There are numerous joys of being
a nerd, some of them even involv-
ing the opposite sex.

The best part of being a nerd is
knowing no fear. Or at least less
fear than usual. Seeing a movie

poster or a book that tries to
scare the viewer with a bunch of
mathematical equations is gener-
ally an intimidating experience.

' Until you’ve studied lots of math.

Then, you can very smugly say
to your English-major buddy “oh
that’s easy, it’s a trivial derivative.
And it was done wrong” and have
god-like status for knowing how
to differentiate. Those lengthy
papers in technical ournals,
though still scary, become more
understandable the more of them
you read. Nerdiness is an immu-
nization against the terror of the
technical.

Nerds are also rebellious by
nature, but rebellious in a unique
way that doesn’t irritate grown-
ups. Some of us actually do know
where the bounds of popular cul-
ture are —— we just don’t care to
partake in it. Granted, some of us
are clueless, but still, we march
to our own drums and don’t have

Stevens’ replacement, life about the lvies

With class stratification as present as ever, Ivy Leaguers are promised a safe future — whether they deserve it or not.

Dave Beitzel
Columnist

 

Justicejohn Paul Stevens announced his re-

. tirement this month. His vacancy leaves a

series of demographics unrepresented on the
nation’s highest bench.,Despite his nomina-
tion by Gerald Ford, Stevens was the liberal’s

liberal. He was the only justice who served - 7

in World War II. He was the only Protestant
on the bench.

The most important trait of Stevens,
though, is that he was the only non—Ivy-
educated justice. Speciﬁcally, he was the
only justice who didn’t go tb either Harvard
or Yale. . I

More than Stevens’ departure, his re-
placement’s nomination will showcase a
clear message about class in the United
States. Namely, that you can do anything
in this world, but only if you went to an Ivy
League university. Class is the tallest, hard-
est glass ceiling, and one that only thickens
with time. '

  ‘ ,'. (M ‘ t A;

 

".P'k.§j-ll.

Three of the four top contenders to re_—
place Stevens went to Harvard: Elena Kagan,
Merrick Garland, and Jennifer Granholm.
Diane Wood went to the University of Texas,
though she taught with President Obama at
the University of Chicago’s law school. So you
can apparently get around this class barrier
if you worked with a president.

However, it’s not likely any Pitt students
can count future presidents as current col-
leagues. Not since Ronald Reagan has a
president lacked an Ivy League education:
George H.W. Bush (Yale), Bill Clinton (Yale),

When You Store."

542 5018

George W. Bush (Yale) and Barack Obama
(Harvard).

That list, though, exposes an alternate
side to this idea of the reserved-for—Ivy
meritocracy. All of those presidents came
from wildly different backgrounds, includ-
ing low- class upbringings. For them, an Ivy
degree was an arbiter of class, propelling

 

them upward in a way that no other action

could have. '

tively. This allows the universities to offer
equally massive ﬁnancial aid to lower—class
students, so long as they get accepted. Basi-
cally, if you .get in, you can go.

But who gets in? Obama got in at Harvard
after a lifetime of toiling and achievement.
But’ George W. Bush got accepted to Yale
with a 1206 on the old-form SATs. He got
in because of his powerful alumnus father.
That’s not a judgment — any Pitt student
would accept the same deal.

Unlike Pitt graduates facing a dearth of
job prospects, Ivy graduates suffer from a dif-
ferent problem. They have too many offers.
Whereas they once wanted humanitarian
or public positions,,they pick Wall Street
or Halliburton after they get a load of their
loan repayment ﬁgures. Or maybe they’re_

already liquid and they just see the salary

offerings of the private sector.

They have a chance to elevate, or at least
retain, a high social class. Conversely, many
graduates from non-Ivy institutions might be
wondering if the cost of their education actu-
ally lowered their class. Tens of thousands of
dollars in debt, no job prospects and four or

Selective memories close, questionable

The beneﬁts are clear, but what are the downsides to erasing our painful memories?

_ Sherri Huang
Contributing Editor

Some novice softball players learn how to
catch a deep fly ball almost immediately
after they begin the sport. I nearly died
during one of my ﬁrst attempts. .

My coach batted me a deep ﬂy ball at
practice one afternoon, and my eyes fol-
lowed the ﬂuorescent polyurethane ball
until  it blended with the sun.

Within seconds, the ball knocked the
top of my forehead, and I hit the grass.
My vision went black.

Luckily, my visor lessened the impact
of the hit, and I soon regained conscious-
ness. But sometimes I wish I could erase
that episode from my mind and forget the

’ pain and shame I felt.

I’ve wondered at one point or another
what life would be like if I could erase all
the unpleasant experiences and people
from my mind.

I’d preserve only the memories of people
who have made me happy, eliminating from
my mind the friends who have betrayed me,
the politicians who have disappointed me

I GARAGE noon
sALoou s

and the guys who have broken my heart.
Well, technological advances within
the next few decades might enable me to
do just that. Z
The journal Neuron reported in 2008
that researchers from the Medical College
of Georgia experimented with mice and

found a way to remove speciﬁc memories
by manipulating a certain protein.

The process didn’t damage brain cells.
The study’s outcome supports the feasibil-
ity of developing a way to remove selective
memories from the brain.

But humans are not laboratory mice,

‘and even though some scientists have said

certain memory systems will likely work
identically on people, no one has under-
gone such an experiment that would surely
prompt ethical concerns.

So how do we know if similar memo-

 

ry-erasing procedures will work on hu-
mans?

A recent New York Times article re-
ported that researchers at a medical center
in Brooklyn have discovered how to erase
certain memories with an experimental

drug that blocks chemical activity in the
brain needed to retain learned informa-
tion. '

Continued research in neuroscience, a
growing ﬁeld that has attracted billions of
dollars toward brain—related projects, will
reveal if memory editing truly works —
whether for helping Victims of traumatic
loss or helping the average heartbroken
girl move on with her life.

But erasing unpleasant memories does
not necessarily guarantee a happier, easier
life.-

Take the 2004 hit “Eternal Sunshine of
the Spotless Mind” for example.

The ﬁlm’s characters Joel and Clemen-
tine experience a bad turn in their relation-
ship and decide to erase each other from
their memories by undergoing a psychi-
atric experiment.

But they later regret the procedure af-
ter realizing how much their relationship
actually mattered, to them.

It’s the classic example that people don’t
treasure what they have until it’s gone — a
sad truth of life.

And what about success with the op-

show it very clearly sometimes, and the
fellow simply wouldn’t get the hint. Most
of the time, the lack of “action” in the life
of a nerd is not so much because of a lack
of opportunity as a lack of perception.

Take, for example, an episode in my

life. A girl once asked me for homework
help in the hallway in high school before
classes. I cheerfully said “Why, sure,” and
helped her with the problems. I could not
understand why she seemed so upset when
I concluded with the homework, asked if
there were any other questions and left.
I mean, I helped her with the homework,
didn’t I? That she likely had ulterior mo-
tives never crossed my mind.
Romantically, being a nerd provides a
very nice ﬁlter for those who are and are
not worthwhile. After all, if somebody is
unpleasant to someone he perceives as
socially inept or slightly immature, that

somebody is not a nice person. They arenft
worth your time. So, better to have them
display what they are, by saying, “Why
would I want a nerd like you?” then to have
to play a guessing game.

There is also the fallacy that nerds are
interested in exactly the same sorts of
people everyone else is interested in —
nerds all want either the cheerleaders or
the starting quarterback as a signiﬁcant
other. Now, while we might not object to
having those signiﬁcant others, we cer-
tainly don’t object to dating another nerd,
which carries several advantages. First, you
share common interests, and if not, can

create a few. Second, there is less competi-
tion in the market for intelligent signiﬁcant
others, particularly men looking for smart
women. Third, social ineptness is not as
big a deal because your signiﬁcant other
understands and is the same. V

The point is, we the nerds of the world
do not want to be converted. We are happy
where we are, thank you very much. In-
deed, the plot of the movie would have
been much better if the girl shows up at
the guy’s house and the guy teaches her
calculus instead.

Book chronicles history of

The Maine

T een— pop band-publishes book, visits Pittsburgh to, please fans . . 

Bethie Girmai
Staﬁ"Wri ter

Teen—pop band The Maine, ' still
reeling from the success of its latest
release, Can’t Stop Won’t Stop, has
stayed true to its album title.

In the midst of their last tour and
in addition to preparing to record a
new album, the Tempe, Ariz., natives
published a book called “This is Real
Life”.

One of the band’s guitarists, Ken-

nedy Brock, who also lends his vocals
to the band, explained the book was «

motivated by the fans.
‘.‘We wanted to do something for

the fans that have been with us for a-

long time. We wanted to give them
something they’ve never really ha ,”
Brock said.

The book, which chronicles the
band’s two—month stint at last year’s
Van’s Warped Tour, ‘showcased the
work of the band’s friend Dirk Mai,
a photographer for the Los Angeles-
based digital publication, Cliché
Magazine.

“Dirk Mai, who did all the pho-
tos ir1 the book, became really good

friends with us over some photo

shoots we had done priorto the book,
so we decided to bringhim outon the
tour,” Brock said.

The band hoped the book, which
was the brainchild of drummer Pat
Kirch, would offer its fans an inside
look into their experiences while on
tour. "

“What we wanted to do was.ex—
press what we were doing on tour
in our own way and show kids what
touring is really like from our words,”
he said. _ V

The book is a visual and writ-
ten compilation of the band’s daily
thoughts, feelingsand experiences
on tour. ' i

“All of us wrote in journals every
night and basically tried to surnup
whatwe were feeling onWarped Tour,
which is very up and down; it can be.
very fun and very hard at the same
time,” he said. “Some of us wrote
aboutwhathappened duringthe day,
some of us drew pictures, it’s kind of
just got a lot of random things.”

When my mother dropped me off for my
freshman year of college, she gave me a hug
on Bigelow Boulevard and whispered in my
ear, “If you become one of those kids who
wears ‘sweatpants all the time, I won’t let
you come home.” '

The four years since my mother’s stern
advice have ﬂown by faster than Heidi Mon-

tion, but I can conﬁdently say I’ve learned
a lot during my stay at Pitt. So I present to-

’ you, for my ﬁnal column, a list of lessons.

others I’ve just realized recently. They are
all of equal importance.’ (Except, perhaps,‘
the bit about skirt lengths. That you can

It’s possible to have a‘ closet of things that

it’s better to let yourself relax before‘ you

Facebook stalking is a perfectly acceptable
form of procrastination when it is used to

ideas to absorb by clicking though recently

Always thank the people who matter. To
my roommates who have patiently waited
for me to pickoutan outfit all these

years, thank you.

Generally speaking, when people offer
advice, I assume they’re not talking to me.
The bits and pieces I do absorb, I struggle to
keep at the forefront of my mental repertoire
and only consider from time to time.

So I offer you this advice, knowing quite
well that you might not listen to it all. “Sam
is talking to someone else,” you’re thinking.
And that’s OK. Head for the Sudoku. If you’re
willing to put off studying for ﬁnals a little

longer, though, here is what I’ve learned -

and what I’d advise: —

To my roommates who have patiently waited
for me to pick out an outﬁt all these years,
thank you. To the professors who didn’t
say anything when I slipped in to class late
because I couldn’t decide on said outﬁt,
thank you. To H&M, which has provided me
with an endless stream of closet additions,
I thank you most of all.

2. College is a time of consumption. You
eat when you’re bored, spend money when
you’re stressed, drink when you’re celebrat-
ing (even if you’re just celebgating the fact
that you made it to Thursday); I’m not go-

apply eyeliner on the inside of my eyelids.
It’ll make your Friday nights so much bet-

double check the length. I have had some
near-disasters with night wear that could
have easily been avoided if I had bothered
to walk out of the dressing room and look
in a three—way mirror. On the other hand, if
any of you ladies enjoy walking down Oak-
land Avenue as the object of loose—moral
mishaps’, then don’t double check at all.

CONCERT PREVIEW

Christian rapper Manafest to perform at Pete

Rapper’s goal to make good music but not compromise values

Liz Keeney
Stajf Writer

Manafest doesn’t like to think of himself as a
Christian rapper, despite the fact that the in~
dustry has given him that label.

For Manafest, born Chris Greenwood, the
label “Christian rapper” can sometimes be a
hindrance. He has said his goal is to make good
music but not tocomprornise his values. His
goal isn’t to convert atheists; it’s to put on a
good show. His website calls him a “man on a
rnission’? to sell as many records, put on as many
shows —including one in Pittsburgh May 7 and
one May 8 —and make as much of that “good

Greenwood, who spent most of his child-
hood honing his skateboarding skills in his
hometown of Ontario, didn’t start writing lyr-
ics until the age of 18. g

_ He said thathis childhood is abig inspiration
for him. On his new album T/ye C/Jaye, one of his
favorite songs “Plan B” is about his experiences
skateboarding and hanging out with friends as a
teenager. The term comes froman expression he
and his friends used to use and is now a mantra
for Greenwood.

Another song “Everytime You Run” tells a
story of second chances and the choices you
have to make in the aftermath. _

“I want my songs to encourage people. My
songs come with a resolution. I don’t force my

views on anyone either, I ask them to make up '

their own minds. And if a songlike, ‘Everytime
You Run’ helps one person through a dark time
intheir life, then I feel like I’m doing something
positive with my music and my life,” he said.
Greenwood admitted that he didn’t initially

plan on beinga role model. He got into rapping 4

Underground ﬁlms an alternative to blockbusters

Summer blockbusters need not ‘Eclipse’ the movie scene.

Andy Tybout
Columnist

«.1.

Summer movie previews in newspapers are
like the GameDay rosters they pass out at bas-
ketball games — any self-respecting fan has
already committed the big names to memory
and needs no additional 411.

For a moment, I’m ashamed to say, I’d in-
tended to give you just that: a dispassionate
rundown of this summer’s blockbusters. But
you watch TV. You surf the World Wide Web. I

know you, like most of America, have heard of _

the following ﬁlms: “Iron Man 2,” “Toy Story

A 3,” “Eclipse,” “Robin Hood,” etc. ,

£5” Instead, I decided to make a list of the
summer movies you might not have heard of
—— those ﬁlm absent from the Super Bowl ad
line—up. So I present, in chronological order,
the hopeﬁil underground hits of the summer,
coming to select cities near you: '

“Exit Through the Gift Shop” (April 16):
Bringing the Intemet’s handheld camera may-
hem to the silver screen, “Gift Shop” is the
story of one French shopkeeper’s attempt to
capture legendary street artist and recluse
Banksy on ﬁlm. Does the shopkeeper get into

seem to indicate “yes” on both counts.

“The Good, the Bad, the Weird” (April 23):
Making its New York debut this month after
a run in Korea, this over—the-top play on the
classic Western ﬁlm follows three criminals as
they race across the 1930s Manchurian desert
following a mysterious map. What does the

map lead to? It doesn’t'’ matter — there are
plenty of comically sensational battles to keep
viewers hooked.

“Sex 8: Drugs & Rock & Roll” (May 5): De-
buting in America at the Tribeca Film Festival,
this British biopic of punk legend Ian ‘Dury
(“Hit Me With Your Rhythm Stick”) seems to
follow, at ﬁrst glance, your standard music
movie formula: stunning lead performance,
standard storyline.

It’s not often, though, that a biopic’s leading
actor can claim King,Kong and Gollum as his
most famous roles. Playing himself for once,
rather than a computer—generated avatar,
Andy Serkis is the perfect ﬁt for the polio-
stricken musical icon — boasting both a rich
emotional palate and an uncanny control of
the body. ' .

mation. Here’s two things, though, the ﬁlm
already has to its credit: It’s produced by “Pan’s
Labyrinth” mastermind Guillermo del Tom,
and it’s a study of evolution gone awry a la
“Jurassic Park.” Do you really need to know
the details?

“I Am Love” (June 18):‘I know, it sounds

melodramatic, especially when pronounced
by its Italian title, “Io sono l’amore” — "and
it is, to some degree. But the ﬁlm’s intense,
bordering on scary trailer and the rave reviews
it’s been receiving from our friends in'the U.K.,
indicate “I Am Love” is much more than a soap
opera. Amidst stunning cinematography and
an overpowering score, British actress Tilda

wedded to a rich businessman in Milan. To

escape from lowbrow blockbusters.
“Inception” (July 16): Okay, this might be
a bit more mainstream, but “Inception” de-
mands mention because it marks the return
of Christopher Nolan, the auteur behind “The
Dark Knigh ” and “Memento.” Looking, from
the awe-inspiring teaser, like a throwback to

Nolan’s earlier high—concept thrillers with _

millions more dollars going into production,
“Inception” promises to be, if nothing else,
a giant and satisfying mind—f*ck. Seriously,
watch thetrailer. If you like Nolan as much

as I do, your excitement might verge on that‘

of a 13-year old “Twilight” fan watching the

TECHNOLOGY

Microsoft ’s ups and downs translate into only ups for sales-

For all of Vista’s stumbles, Microsoft continues to progress.

Donald Campbell
Columnist

 

As I kept an eye out for an interesting topic
for the last column of my college career, I
wondered how Microsoft was doing. Over
the four years I’ve written for The Pitt News,
I’ve written many columns reviewing Micro-
soft’s various operating systems, pointing
out their nice features and, in the case of
Vista, analyzing their stumbles.

So I thought to myself: Although my
previous columns predicted that Micro-
soft might encounter some troubles, did
Microsoft really stumble?

According to a new article from Com-
puterworld.com, those of us who thought
that Microsoft might see a modest hit to its

inﬂuence were quite mistaken. Data recent— V

ly released on Microsoft’s recent earnings

show they made 35 percent more income ‘

than a year before. A

Windows Vista was, according to many
picky operating system users, a complete
failure technically. Sales-wise, however, it
was not. According to Computerworld, many
consumers didn’t care enough to boycott
the operating system. The world kept on

Corporate users decided to keep XP —
another Microsoft product —~ and simply
paid Microsoft for XP, rather than Vista.
One might even say that Microsoft gained
a little bit from Vista. Although people didn’t
leave Microsoft en masse to become Linux
gurus or Macintosh enthusiasts, a general
dissatisfaction with Vista probably boosted

Vista time.

Microsoft may have reached its previ-
ous goal of truly moving on from XP, a goal
that angrily eluded them when Vista was
on the market.

Even if you were to look to the future
with some level of pessimism and realism,
Microsoft comes out smelling like roses.

asm about Windows 7 will eventually wane.

Once new computers began shipping with
Windows 7 rather than Vista, this undoubt-

able with the purchase.

Microsoft predicts that 10 percent of
the computer world is currently running

of a milestone for the young operating sys-

continue to make sustainable money.

in the computer arena shows no signs of

Microsoft will also, more than likely, use
the success of Windows 7 to branch into
different markets. Talk has already been
swirling about whether Windows 7 will prove
to be truly an excellent idea on a netbook or
smart phone or embedded platforms. For
some time, Microsoft has been interested
in touch computing; with the introduction
of the iPad, Microsoft might feel more com-
pelled to bring some Windows—based solu-
tion to market. HP has already announced
its desire to use Windows as the platform of
choice for its iPad competitor, the Slate.

And so, Iﬁnish my column — and my time
at Pitt —— in a computing industry essentially
where it was when I started. Although other
companies have some successes, the com-

tive, and there is a substantial population
that continues to complain about Microsoft’s
dominance. Microsoft continues to be a be-
hemoth with few true signs of stopping.

This fact is deﬁnitely true in my apart-
ment. Although I often complain about

my three computers still run Microsoft Win-

MUSIC ANALYSIS

‘My mom is cooler than

your mom

Kelsey Shea
Asst. A&E Editor

My mom probably has better taste in music
than you.

Don’t get mad. It’s not an insult. She
probably has better taste in music than me
—— minus her whole infatuation with ABBA,
of course.

The reason my 48-year-old mother prob-
ably has better taste than us lies in the fact

at she is, well, 48.

My mom’s fallen into a unique age group
that is old enough to be free of social prej-
udices against certain music but young
enough to know how to use the many music
searching engines, websites and programs
out there.

For example, my mom would never hear
the name Animal. Collective and say, “Um,
yeah right. Maybe I’d be into them if my
pants were a lot tighter and I only drank fair
trade coffee.” She wouldn’t have any hipster
association with it. It would simply just be a

mew band that she’s never heard of before.

No preconceptions and no expectations.

Thus, her taste isn’t limited at all by vague
expectations or social prejudices.

My mom also has the beneﬁt of having
three charming and technologically savvy
daughters to introduce her to online radio,
iPods, how to actually use iTunes and her
computer’s CD burner. So she’s got all that
the World Wide Web has to offer her and
no inhibitions about what she is supposed
to listen to or what is socially acceptable
for her. (I think even if something weren’t
“socially acceptable” she probably wouldn’t
mind. My mom does what she wants.).

So this isn’t to say that my mom is some
great authority on the true nature of music
—— she just has a large pool and no precon-
ceptions about what music is supposed to
be or how good it is.

She’s introduced me to cool bands
and performers that I love, like Adrienne
Young and Little Sadie and Delta Spirit that
I wouldn’t have guessed I would like. I

Then again, she did make me listen to
“Country Ladies” for long hours in the car.
All the same, she’s still cooler than the aver-
age mom.

MUSIC" REVIEW

Sophomore release
perfect for finals week

Crystal Castles’ sound soothing for over—worked brains

Alison Smyth
Staﬁ’ Writer

Crystal Castles’ sophomore album could
not have come at a better time. It’s ﬁnals
week, your brain can only process simple
words and desires: Coffee, sleep, alarm,
evil, papers.

Crystal Castles II wakes the dead brains
of zombiﬁed college students with its club-
ready tunes. Songs are short bursts of sound
with few words, overwhelming static and a
beat that helps you focus.

Repetition and perfect length work for
short attention spans in songs like “Doe
Deer” with minimal vocals to distract you.
Here, just like in their self-titled debut,

Crystal Castles
Crystal Castles II
Digital Self-Release
Rocks Like: Your brain
on finals week.

Grade: B+

Alice Glass yells over beats and robotic
bops. 7

“Empathy” balances a softer vocal with
a strong and steady electric sound, whereas
“Suffocation” goes almost ethereal pop.

Crystal Castles’s ﬁrst album was a little
cleaner, friendlier. Crystal Castles II takes
on a little pop, a little shoegazing rock with
a beat that’s all electronica. The music’s
straight forward, loud and soothing.

You might have a stack of papers and a
week of exams, but an arsenal of energy
drinks, No. 2 pencils and Crystal Castles
II can ease that brain pain.

and cast aside. p
I don’t like to own up to my emotions,
especially when they might include the

possibility of leaky tear ducts or stiﬂed-

sobs.

I also wish that the thought of leaving
the best four years of my life (admittedly,
only two of them at Pitt) wasn’t so su-
premely depressing.

It doesn’t have to be, though. Goodbyes
are not always meant to be the heartfelt,
tear-jerking incidents that popular culture
makes them out to be.

The Beatles believe that there is a hello ‘

for every goodbye ‘(and Snoopy wishes
the same), and the cast of “Friends” was
totally loving its final moments together
on the small screen.

Saying goodbye to millions upon mil-
lions of devoted fans, J.K. Rowling let fans
know that “All-is well” in the Harry Potter
universe.

So-although this goodbye reeks of sen-
timentality, I would prefer to end it — and
essentially, my career at The Pitt News —
on a short, abrupt and happy note.

Peace out, my loyal readers, and re-

The Pitt baseball team trails Connecticut, prepares for three-game series against Huskies

Randy Lieberman

The Pitt baseball team swept its weekend
series against West Virginia, exploding
for a season-high 24 runs on.27 hits in the
series ﬁnale. ‘

With the weekend sweep of the Moun-
taineers‘ and Louisville’s loss to Seton Hall,
the Panthers (30-10, 12-3) now sit in sec-
ond place in the Big East. The Panthers
trail only Connecticut, and the two play a
three—game series this weekend at Trees
Eéeld.

“Coach [Jim] Penders does a phenom-
enal job with the Huskies,” Pitt head coach
Joejordano said. “We have a great deal of
respect for them, and they are playing as
well as any team in the country. It will be
a great series, but we will take the same
approach as we have all season.”

Jordano said the team will take three
days off for ﬁnals and return to practice on
Thursday to prepare for Connecticut.

Pitt won the ﬁnal game at Morgantown,

Seton Hall took an early 1-0 lead in
the ﬁrst inning, but sophomore Kristen
Cheesebrew tied the score with a solo
homerun in the second. .

The fourth inning was the deciding fac-
torof the game as the Pirates scored ﬁve
runs.

The Panthers, however, would not go

‘down quietly, as Cheesebrew and Tutt

both launched homeruns.

The homerun was'Cognigni’s first of x

the season, while Tutt’s blast brought her
season-total to four.

Despite the success of the long ball, the »

Panthers needed defensive strength, espe-
cially in the seventh inning asthe Pirates

‘ attempted a comeback.

Berliner had the bases loaded with only

one out, but the play behind thepitcher ,

allowed the Panthers to escape with the
2—1 win. - .

With a ground ball force-out at the plate
bringing the-out total to two, Berliner se-
cured-the victory as the ﬁnal Pirate’s batter
went down swinging.

The second game of the day was similar

' in respect to thePanther’s offense, which ,

again scored two runs off of the homers of
Tutt and fellow sophomore Ciera Damon.

Tutt has been a major offensive threat
for Pitt, especially in Big East play, as she
leads the team in batting average, home
runs and slugging percentage in confer-
enceaction.

However, the Pirates offense came alive
and scored eight runs in the contest, start-
ing early with a three-run third inning..

’ Junior pitcher Alyssa 0’Connell suffered

The Panthers, however, would not go

down quietly, as Cheesebrew and Tutt both _

launched homeruns after the ﬁve-run per-
formance of the Pirates.

Adding to the sophomore success was
Yvette Bravo, who drove in Tutt in the bot-
tom of the seventh inning and brought the

"Panthers within two runs.
With the RBI, Bravo brought her season .

total to a team—high 28. _

Still, the offensive efforts were not
enough to-match Seton Hall as Berliner
took the loss for the Panthers while senior
Ashley Forsyth earned the win. ‘

Berliner pitched 3.1 innings and gave

up ﬁve runs off seven hits and 0’Connell

came in to relieve Berliner.
The/ﬁnal two runs_ were attributed to
0’Connell. V
.Forsyth was recently, named to the Big
East Honor Roll, which acknowledges con-
ference players Who have shown success in
the previous week. '
The Panthers will host another con-

ference opponent in a three—g_ame series '

Pitt just can’t ﬁnd a way to beat Rutgers.

The women’s tennis team lost to the
Scarlet Knights 4-0 in the ﬁrst round of
the Big East tournament this weekend, then
fell to St. John’s in the consolation round to
ﬁnish the season at 10-9.

Head coach George Dieffenbach said
the Panthers entered the season with three
goalszﬁnish with a winning record, get to
the post—season and the Big East Champi-
onship and improve upon their showing in
the tournament from last season, when the

' team ﬁnished seventh.

“We didn’t improve upon our ﬁnish from
last season, and we’re disappointed in that,
but the team showed a lot of improvement
throughout the year,” Dieffenbach said.
“They were very competitive.” »

Pitt lost the doubles point against Rut-
gers, with the pairs of Gabrielle Catanzariti
and Sabrina Visram and Adela Aprodu and
Karma Parbhu each falling 8-1. Elizabeth

thers fall in Big East Championship

Adams and Shannon Benic didn’t ﬁnish
because the point was already decided.

“Rutgers is a very good team,” Diefl'en—
bach said. “They, are a smart team, consis-
tent as well as aggressive and offensive. We
knew we would have our hands full as we did
before. We gave them a good match before,
and we fought them tough this time also.”

Pitt dropped three matches in singles,
which sealed the victory for Rutgers. Ad-
ams, Benic and Visram didn’t ﬁnish their
matches because Rutgers already: secured
the four points needed for a victory.

“Benic’s match was very close, especially
in the second set.” Dieffenbach said. “Vis-
ram was in her match, as well. It could have
gone either way.”

Adams lost her ﬁrst set 5-7, but was up
5-0 on Amy Zhang when the match was
stopped. Despite the fact that she didn’t
ﬁnish, Dieffenbach said the score with

Zhang this time was “a nice turnaround” P

for Adams.

season.

Pitt sports came a long way in 4 years

Advice for Pitt athletics: Bring back the Pitt script uniforms, add victory lights after basketball wins >—

— .f p I Randy Lieberman

Senior Stajfwriter,

So, this is it. For the ﬁnal time, you’ll read my
weekly spiel. .

' It was my pleasure to write about sports for
you, and whether you rejoice or are stricken
with sadness after losing your favorite colum-

. . nist, this will be my parting word.

I remember way back when, sitting in a
chair getting grilled by former Pitt News sports
editors Jeff Greer and Pat Mitsch during my
initial interview. That was when writing about
Pitt sports seemed about as natural as doing a
backflip from a standstill.

Whew, what was that, ages ago? Slightly
less than four years actually, I still'can’t do
that backﬂip, but I can write a game recap at

- least. Back then, Boomerangs still boomed,
market was a “place” — not central — and
Pitt fans went to football games to heckle the
Toledo Rockets more so than to watch their
team win. ~ .

Since then, I’ve had the privilege of watching
Pitt athletics grow into a nationally recognized

department, ﬁill of bright minds gaining mo-
mentum with every little athletic accomplish-
ment. _ _ ' .
The premier accomplishment, in my eyes,
was Pitt’s 13-9 victory over then—No. 2 West

_ Virginia. We all know where we were when
, Pittpulled the biggest rabbit out of the most

unexpected, proverbial hat against the Moun-
taineers back in 2007. A V
Sure, Pitt’s not the football powerhouse like,

as others, Pitt’s program won’t ever become the
major one its fans hope for. - A

Or at least the one Pitt fans get when they
go to the Petersen Events Center.

Wow, Pitt basketball fans, you better count
your blessings that you were born when you.
were. For the foreseeable future, probably the
next four years, I see nothing but consistent
Sweet 16 teams rolling through Pitt. Dante
Taylor is going to be really good, and just wait

For all the praise I have for this

Tunpiverslty that I love, I do want to

make some final recommendations

_ say, Ohio State or Florida, norwill it ever be. To ~

believe one day Pitt will sell out Heinz Field for
its spring game, like these schools do at their
stadiums, is absurd. Don’t get me wrong, head
coach Dave Wannstedt is leading the program
splendidly, but with afan base not as expansive

until some of Pitt’s recruits develop into Big
East standouts. .

For all the praise I have for this University
thatI love, I do want to make some ﬁnal recom-
mendations for Pitt athletics as I depart:

Please, please, hold one Pitt throwback jer-

sey game armually
I’ve debated this countless times. Why won’t

Pitt football ever wear its script uniforms for
at least one game a year? Is some kind of men;
chandising/marketing issue holding this back,

because if it is, that’s a darn shame. Imagine _
_ sitting in the stands, with Panther greats Dan

Marine and Tony Dorsett on hand, and seeing
Pitt run out _of the tunnel wearing the jerseys
from a time when it won three national cham-
pionships in ﬁve years.

Remove the overbearing advertisements
on the best seats at Heinz Field

This is the most puzzling of all. The seats

directly below the scoreboard, the ones where‘

you can smell what scent of deodorant each
player is wearing, are some of the best seats
in the stadium. Remove the Big East and Pitt
advertisements and put fans in those stands ——
maybe a “Lewis Leap” or ‘jBJump” can come
of it aftertouchdowns. F

Turn on the “Victory Lights” after Pitt bas-
ketball wins, too

Pitt has a great emblem of victory inthe gold
ﬁghts on top of the Cathedral ‘of Learning, but
why should football hog all of its glory? Turn

Summer predictions: Pens, Magic will win ,

u.

Pirates will continue losing ways as Yankees keep winning.

Donnie Tasser
Staﬁ‘Wri ter

Sure, the weather’s heating up. But so are
the playoffs.

There have been upsets abound so far
in the first round of both the NHL and NBA
playoffs. In hockey, the seventh—seeded
Philadelphia Flyers upset the second-
seeded New Jersey Devils in ﬁve games,
even after losing two of their best players,
Simon Gagne and Jeff Carter, for the rest
of the playoffs with foot injuries. Barring
an upset of epic proportions, the Flyers
will take on the Washington Capitals in
the second round.

Being a native Pittsburgher, I cannot
tell you how_ much I hate both of those
teams. But, for the sake of the Pens, I will
be rooting for the Flyers. Wow, writing that
just made me cringe. Anyhow, I just don’t
see Philly being able to keep up offensively
with Ovechkin and company. I’m calling

~ the Caps in six.

The Pens, fresh off that exciting series
with Ottawa, will most likely play the win-

  i§IDAY.4e6,
Must be 21 to drink

ner of the Buffalo—Boston series, in which
Boston currently leads 3-2 and Game 6
takes place tonight. I think that Buffalo
will even the series with a victory tonight,
but look for the Bruins to win Game 7. The
Pens, led by a red~hot Sidney Crosby, will
win three one-goal games and win the se-
ries in ﬁve.

In the West, top seed San Jose dis-
patched the pesky Colorado Avalanche
in six games, and will probably play the
Phoenix Coyotes in the second round. The
fourth seed Coyotes sent their ﬁrst—round
series to the seventh game with a blowout

win over Detroit. Look for them to carry»

momentum into the biggest home game
the franchise has had since moving to the
desert in 1996 and advance to the second
round for the ﬁrst time in over twenty years
to end the Wings’ run at a third—straight
Finals appearance.

The ‘Yotes will face another team with
little postseason success when the play the
Sharks. Sanjose, after a shaky start against
Colorado, found a nice groove that makes

it look very dangerous. However, its tradi— '

tion "of playoff futility will continue when

l ‘ RIGHT BY
BENEDUM 8;

it falls to Phoenix in seven games.

The Vancouver Canucks are in a battle
with the Los Angeles Kings. The Canucks
will close out the Kings and then play the
winner of the Chicago-Nashville series.
Again I see momentum factoring heavily
in this series, and the Blackhawks have all
of it after that stunning overtime victory
Saturday night that saw Patrick Kane tie the
game with a short—handed goal in the last
15 seconds, then Marian Hossa win it with
a goal immediately after coming out of the
penalty box in overtime. Hawks in six.

‘For the conference ﬁnals, a highly enter-
taining rematch between the Pens and Caps
will be alongside an interesting Coyotes-
Blackhawks series. Everyone will have their
eyes on the Sid—Ovie rivalry and will mostly
forget about the ‘Yotes and Hawks. Well
don’t. The Coyotes are an exciting young
team that the NHL rescued from bankrupt-
cy, and the Hawks, one of the “Original Six”
NHL teams, are hungry for a title — they
haven’t won a Cup in ﬁfty years. Anyway,
the Washington—Pittsburgh series promises
to be just as exciting as lastyear’s, with the
outcome also being the same — the Pens

in seven. Call it Yinzer bias if you want,
but I just don’t see the Capitals being able
to beat the Penguins in the playoffs. Now
back to Phoenix-Chicago. As great as the,
Coyotes’ run has been this year, it comes
to an end here, when the Blackhawks close
out the series in six.

Now on to the Stanley Cup Finals. Both
teams boast young, exciting offensive tal-
ent. Expect the Pens to match up their
tough guy line of Mike Rupp, Craig Adams
and Matt Cooke, who played so admirably
against the Senators, against the top line
of Hossa, Kane andjonathan Toews. Both
teams’ spectacular but inconsistent goal-
ies, Marc—Andre Fleury and Antti Niemi,
will need to step up to the challenge that»
is their opponents’ offensive prowess. Fl-
eury’s Cup track record makes the differ-
ence, and the Pens continue the “Hossa
Curse,” winning in six.

The ﬁrst round of the NBA playoffs is ,

not typically as exciting as the ﬁrst round
of the NHL — maybe that’s just my opinion
— but this year some upsets are brewing.
The Cavaliers are facing a much tougher
opponent than expected in the eighth—seed

Withalldue respecttoNeil Diamond, it’s time
to move on. There are plenty of people who need
to be mentioned in my ﬁnal column. Yes, we’re
onto the mushy part, unfortunately.

First off, I’ve got to mention religious leaders.
Props to them for being so religious.

Next, who knows where I’d be without Castro,
my family’s dog. His late-night phone calls were
ﬁlled with more meaningful advicethanl canput
into words.Ishould probablyalso mentionthe rest
ofmyfamilytoofortheirunwavering support and
reluctance to acknowledge my mediocrity—that

. wasanice change ofpacefromtheverbalthrashing

Igive myselfon adaily basis.

Of course, there are alsomy numerous edi-
tors over the year — Alan, Pat, _]eﬁ', Mike, Zack
and countless copy editors — who did their best
to make me appear literate. Most people don’t
know, but all of tl1ese are submitted handwritten
in crayon.

I deﬁnitely need to mention Bill Murray and
David Letterman for being such swell dudes.

Butthere’s of course one more group of people
more important than all of them, and that’s the
readers. Without them, these are just words on a
page. Instead, these are words on a page that get
skimmed through during class, and for that I’m
grateﬁil for the ones upon ones of fans I’ve gar-
nered. Ifthere was such a group, I’d call them the
Littmaniacs. So to them, I say you’re welcome.

I guess that’s it. It’s been real, well not really
until now, but it’s been fun. I could close this with
aspeech about communistbody-snatchingaliens
or telling Hannah to look up. Instead, it seems
much more true to character to go out like this,
so I leave youwith words of advice from someone
much greaterthan me, Black Thought.

“Youwannabe a man, then stand your own.”

Pitt needs a shuttle
for baseball games

Lieberman 4 39

them on after Pitt basketball wins. It’s a great
way to feel a sense of school pride for the top
athletic program on campus. If not the regular
season, then deﬁnitely the postseason.

Give me one good reason to hike a moun-
tain to watch a Pitt baseball, softball or soccer
game

Most of us South Oaklanders don’t venture
up near Trees Hall too much, except if we’re
working out, swimming or attending a ﬁtness
class. With Pitt’s new Petersen Athletic Com-
plex, Pitt needs to make sure fans are in the
stands for Pitt baseball, softball and soccer
games. Get a shuttle to run from the Union to
the complex. The view of Downtown should be
worth the trip alone.

All right, that’s enough of my whining.

Back to that interview with Greer and
Mitsch. I remember I thought, “Wow, when
will I get my own column?” I thought it would
never happen. It did, and though I’ve never
been the funniest, I’ve always tried to be the
most informative columnistl could.

Now, upon my leaving The Pitt News, I hope
you feel the same.

wra

It’s been a great four years. I’ve watched
amazing things happen in sports I thought I
would never appreciate. But it wasn’t the all-
too—painﬁ.1l shock I felt as I watched Scottie
Reynolds nylon a ﬂoater to send Pitt packing
in the Elite Eight.

Nor was it watching in amazement at the
emergence of linebacker Dan Mason in Pitt’s
victory over Navy last season. It wasn’t even
live—blogging as Gary McGhee had the most
technically fouled stumble to the hardwood at
West Virginia this past season.

It was telling the story of the athletes here
at Pitt who don’t get the limelight: a volleyball
player, a gymnast or a swimmer. That’s where
the real stories are, and I hope I gave them the
print they deserved.

There are too many people to thank, but to
editors, friends, fellow writers, athletes and the
media relations’ reps who I incessantly nagged,
I thank you.

Sure, collegewas ﬁm, and itwas tough. But a
funny thing happens when you strike the right
balance between hard work and ﬁm: You have
the time of your life.

I hope you have, because I certainly did.

Celtics will upset Cavaliers

Summer 4 41

Chicago Bulls, and Cleveland is currently
up 3-1. Yet, King James and the Cavs can’t
expect to coast through the ﬁrst round, but
they will pull their act together in time to
win the series in seven.

Tonight, look for the second-seed Or-
lando Magic to ﬁnish out the Bobcats and
the Atlanta Hawks continue on their way
to the second round with a defeat of the
Milwaukee Bucks. Tomorrow the Heat will
bow out to the Celtics — they will stiﬂe
Dwyane Wade eventually.

Now I’m going to jump on the Oklahoma
City Thunder bandwagon. Mark my words,
Kevin Durant will outplay Kobe and the
Thunder will complete possibly the big-
gest upset in NBA Playoff history and win
in seven. All of the other higher seeded
teams in the West —— Dallas, Phoenix and
Denver — will come from behind and win
their hard—fought series.

Orlando will continue its dominating
season and defeat the Hawks in six, and the
Celtics will upset the shaky Cavs, knocking
out the other top—seeded team early. Mark
Cuban and the Dallas Mavericks will end
the Thunder’s Cinderella run and will meet

up with the Suns in the Conference ﬁnals
after they defeat the Nuggets, I’m thinking
in seven.

“Superman” Dwight Howard will lead
the Magic over the Celtics in seven games
and onto the NBA Finals where they wilril
play the Steve Nash—led-Suns, who will
defeat the Mavs. The difference—maker in
the Finals is going to be a throwback. An
aging Vince Carter will hit a buzzer-beater
in game six to give the Magic their ﬁrst
ever NBA Championship, and reignite the
country full of “Vince-anity.”

In baseball news, the Pittsburgh Pi-
rates have just hit the annual spring snag
that will once again send them spiraling
into the abyss that is last place. I had high
hopes for this year’s team — OK, modest
hopes — and the recent series with the
Milwaukee Brewers demolished any opti-
mistic thoughts that I had. Being outscored
36-1 is embarrassing enough, but follow
that up with a sweep at the hands of the
hapless Houston Astros is just too much.
I hope the management decides to care
sometime soon.

Now on to the rest of the league. The

*fZhang],” Dieffenbach said. “She was
matching up some of her strengths with
Zhang’s weaknesses.”

Aprodu fell 6-1, 6-2 tojennifer Holzberg.
Maryana Milchutskey defeated Catanzariti
6-4, 6-1, while Parbhu fell to Caitlin Baker

.61, 6-0. -

The Panthers have never defeated Rut-
gers. They lost 7-0 to the Scarlet Knights
earlier this season.

In the consolation match, the Panthers
met up with St.]ohn’s, a team they beat 4-3

 

on April 17. This weekend, Pitt fell 4-0 to
the Red Storm during the rematch.

Once again, the Panthers lost the dou-
bles point quickly, with the teams of Adams
and Benic and Aprodu and Parbhu each
falling 9-7. Catanzariti and Visram didn’t
ﬁnish their match.

“-We had leads in both of the doubles
matches we lost,” Dieffenbach said. “It’s
tough to lose that doubles point. It swung
the momentum in favor of St. John’s.’’

In singles play, only three of the matches

Catanzariti fell 6-0, 6-4 tojenny Yonkus,
Visram lost 6-2, 7-5 to Ksenia Mikhaylova,
and Parbhu lost to Nakita Austin 6-2, 6-2.

“There were a lot of tough matches,”
Dieffenbach said. “The Panthers went down
swinging, they went down aggressive.”

Adams was voted the Most Valuable
Player by her teammates. She ﬁnished the
season with the best record on the team
in both singles (15-10) and doubles (13-8),

along with her partner Benic.

“That’s quite a lot of leadership she gave
the team,” Dieffenbach said. “She was also a
leader vocally in terms of motivation.”

Dieffenbach said she made progress
throughout her junior year. She’s steadily
improved since she came here, he said, and
she became a more offensive player, a better
server, and a better returner.

“She’s really developed her weapons,”
Dieffenbach said.

The Panthers lose starting seniors Benic
and Visram to graduation this season, but
Dieffenbach said that the players who come
back will work on fundamentals and be-
ing more consistent and that the team will
continue to improve.

“We have a good nucleus returning,” he
said. ‘‘we’ll have a very strong team again
next year, another team of hard workers and
a team that gives 100 percent for Pitt.”

Baseball too
predictable

Summer 4 43

Phillies once again look like the team to
beat in the National League —-- another
cringe -— Roy Halladay was a great pick up
this offseason, and with a 4-0 record and
sub-1.00 ERA it seems that when he takes ‘
the mound it is an automatic W.

Baseball, as much as I, love_it, has become
entirely too predictable. The Yankees, of
$200-million—dollar-payroll fame, will start
another 19,905-like dynasty. Oh, and the,
American League will once again win the
All-Star game, giving the Yanks (or whoever
else) home ﬁeld advantage.

It looks like we are in for another excit-
ing summer full of upsets, Pens dominance,
Pirates futility and sunburn.

Have fun and wear sunscreen.
