beginning at 8:30 o’clock.

Pitt’s basketball Pa.I_1.tl1.e1°s are
going to have -a strong victory
motive this evening when they
meet the Temple Owls at 8 :30
o’clock in the huge Pliiladel-

pionship.

Both teams completed their league
competition with duplicate records,
seven victories as against three de-
feats. In the competitions between
the two, Pitt won the first game and
Temple copped the second.

Determining the winner of to-
night's ‘important ﬂoor meeting is en-
tirely a matter of conjecture. The
atmosphere around - the Stadium

augur well for Dr. Carlspn’s~‘outﬁt.
Word from Philadelphia, asexpressed
by the Eastern city’s sports ..writers,

“Pitt’s mental and physical condi-

Dr. Clifford Carlson, the gentleman
directing the coaching end ‘of the
Panthers just before boarding the
Pullmans in Pennsylvania Station last
evening. “It "is much improved ‘over
our condition the last time we played
in Philadelphia,” added the Pitt coach.

Behind this statement was the fact
that when Pitt went upstate a few
weeks ago they were not in the best
shape because of train jumps out ‘to

At the third of the SFA-sponsored
series of Concert Hours and Book
Chats, Theodore M. Finney, lecturer
in musical appreciation and director
of the Meii".~3 Glee Club, will speak on
the subject of, “Musical Revolution-
Iries.” The talk, open to students and
faculty members, will be given Tues-
day, ﬁfth hour in Room 244, Cathe-
dral.

In his lecture, Mr. Finney will
stress the importance of six compos-
ers whom he feels are most respon-
sible for musical development since
earliest times. The works of some of
these men are rarely heard today on
the concert stage, others have their
compositions performed on almost
every symphony program. The six
composers include Monteverde, Mo-
zart, Wagner, Claude Debussy, Igor
Stravinsky, and Paul Hindeniiithi:

To illustrate his remarks, Mr.‘ Fin-
ney will play certain recdrd_ings of
the composers’ works that ‘A are most
typical of their development.‘ For ex-
ample, he will sing an aria from one
of Mo_ntjeverde’s long forgotten‘ op-
eras; Mozart will be represeii'te.d by
some of his works for chamber music
ensembles; Wagner by selections"
from the “Ring” _cycle and some of
his isolated operas;.and Stravii;isky
with excerpts from the bewildering
cacophony of his ballet suites.-'1

the_ committee to present a concert to
illustrate musical development, using
various groups from the instrumental
and ‘vocal organizationson the cam-

pus. Because’ of active “concertizing at .
this time" of year by most"-of the‘

groups, this plan was abandoned, and
Mr. Finn,ey’s lecture was substituted.
Later in"th_e semester, the committee
plans to institute a series of student
and faculty free-i'tals on the lawn of
the Schenley ‘hotel.

Members of the committee include
William Stark, C38, chairman; Milton
Lehman, ._Jr.,, C39; Kenneth Houp,
C37; Heleficlaii*e Goldsberry, C38;
and Richard Raley, C39. The speaker

Tickets

Tickets for tomorrow and Wed-
nesday evening performances of
“Goodbye Again” are being sold
by members of Pitt Players and
in Room 220, Alumni Hall. Jack

the Players, announces that tickets
for both performances will be on
sale at the door.

that he seldom has felt. “He catches
on quickly, takes cues right, and, con-
sidering the amount of training he
 had, he does a fine job.”

The rest of the cast of “Goodbye
Again,” Director Cass believes, will
be fine. “Remember, they"re not vet-
erans, for only Oscar Goodstein and
Bob Madden have been in Players’
shows before. But lone Williams
plays Amie Rogers well, and Critch-
field is a good Ken Bixby. The play
is an excellent farce, the funniest I
have seen in many years.”

Sophomores In Cast

In the supporting roles of “Good-
bye Again” are William Hoeveler,
C39; Geraldine Marcus, C40; Rita
Blasek, C39; Eleanor Haught, C39;
Andrew Cancelliere, C40, and Earl
Riley, C39. Of the entire cast, only
two are more than sophomores, they
being lone Williams and Bob Madden,
while John Woodside can be consid-
ered C50.

Five years ago “Goodbye Again,"
prepared by George Haight and Allan
Scott, was produced on Broadway.
New York critics, usually quite sober
about such matters as comedies, took
to,‘_‘Goodbye Again.” The New York
Journal__ _remarked that “laughter is
strewn up and down its foolishness.”

call it ‘fas extravagantly funny an en.

Falk Head Proves Use
Of Ancient Lie Detector

By Gene Lipman
“Scientist Perfects New Lie De-
tector . . . Invention Startles World!”
“New invention-—-humbug,” says
Dr. Joseph H. Baracli, medical direc-
tor of the Falk Clinic. “In Selwyn
Brown’s History of Medicine, appears
conclusive proof that lie detector:-2

‘ were used over 700 years ago.”

According to Author Brown, about
1150 A. D. or so in the Persian city
of Gurgan, there was a young fellow

who had contracted a disease that all

the best doctors couldn’t diagnose.

This handsome lad wouldn’t eat,
couldn’t sleep, but just sat around
all day with a “tired, 1-0-ggy feeling.”
He had no pain, so medics were
stumped. (The well-known builder-
upper hadn’t been discovered as yet.)

Then Abu Ali came to town. This
famous young doctor took one look
at the lad, felt his pulse, and, with a
half-puzled, lialf-knowing look in his
eye, sent for a man who knew all the
districts in Gurgan.

As the man called off the districts,
Abu Ali felt the boy’s pulse. At the

mention of a certain qiiarter, the
pulse ﬂuttered strangely. Abu Ali’s
look became less puzzled and more
knowing as he -.-called for someone
who knew all the streets in the Latin
qua.i‘tc1'.

This individual had called off sev-
eral streets when Abu Ali again made
a silly grin. “Find me someone who
lives on W Street and knows
all the people."

Five minutes elapsed, more names
were called off’, then: “Eureka, I have
it!”

The lie detector (the -ﬂuttering of
the boy's pulse) had shown that his
disease was love for a certain young
lady. Need it be said that the fully-
recovered young man and his heart-
throb lived happily ever after?

“In this age of gadgets,” concludes
Dr. Barach, “it is refreshing to know
that the human hand and brain could
really discover 1' ...g.3 in the past. The
more we read of history and medi-
cine, the more respectful we think
those of the past, and the smaller
our own head sizes become.”

it With La Hepbuml

Two Minutes

“Yes, I would like to play “Scar-
lett’.”

It is Katherine I-Iexiurii speak-
ing in the same vibrai emotional
tones which make her well-known
on the stage and screen. In town
with “Jane Eyre” at the Nixon,
she is referring to the much-dis
cussed lead role for the prospective
ﬁlming of “Gone with the Wind."

Members of the cast in the “Jane
Eyre” company prefer Clark Ga-
ole for “Rhett Butler,” saying: “He
is the only man. for the part.”

This wasall we could learn from
Miss Hepburn in a two-minute in-
terview that took us a week to ob-
tain. But we did secure a dozen or
so “chai'ming”"t"alks with the head
operator at the Hotel Schenley,
and we also failed to impress Pop,
the doorman at the Nixon with:

“Say, we’re the fellow who was
in Gap and Gown last year.”

To which Pop retorted: “That’s
ﬁne; I’ll see yc in about four
months.”

ings will close with a panel discus-
sion involving all students present.

To Discuss Youth Act

The topic for cliseussion. the

fore the present session of Congress

ance, vocational trainiug, and em-
ployment opportunities for youths "be-
tween the ages of 16 and 25 and pro-
ride for increased educational appor-
tioiiinenits for high sclioo-l, college, and
postgraduate students. The bill car-
ries with it a provision for an appro-
priation of 500 niillioii dollars for
the first year to accomplish these
ends. ’"

the field of social relations. A grad-
uate of McGill and Notre Dame Uni-

Today Dr. Sutherland begins his
14th year:a—s head man, having just
completed the marked ‘‘13th’’ by re-
ceiving one of the greatest expres-
sions of conﬁdence ever extended a
.-oach. Virtually everyone rallied to
the side of Pitt’s famous Scotch lead-
er, with the result that ‘there was only
one solution to the problem which the
Athletic Council had to solve as the
crisis was successfully met and passed
-luring the past week-end.

W. Don Harrison's resignation from
the position of Director of Athletics,
:1 position which he has held for the
past ten years, was accepted by Ath-
letic Council at a special meeting
Saturday in the Duquesne Club. In
Council's report to Dr. John G. Bow-
man, chancellor, it was recommended
that Mr. Harrison continue to direct
athletic activities other than football
for the balance of the year; that Dr.
Sutherland assume full responsibility
for the football program under Ath-
letic Council without an intermediary
oificer until a successor to Mr. Harri-
son is appointed.

Dr. Bowman accepted the report,
expressing regret in the acceptance
by pointing out that Mr. Harrison
“has -given faithful and ei”‘.’icient serv-
ice.” Dr. Sutherland’s new responsi-
bilities, in addition to his regular
coaching duties, will include the selec-
tion of assistants at salaries within
the budget allotment by the council,

Lasts Six Weeks I

It was just-six weeks ago that the
current controversy in the Athletic
departnient was brought to light by
a New York sports writer who sug-

   

 

gested that Sutherland might leave.

Pitt. Since that event many things
have happened to complicate the sit-
uation to- the extent that Athletic
‘Council was faced with one of two
alternatives: either to retain Suth-
erland by accepting the resignation
of Harrison, or accept a resignation
from Sutherland.‘ -No‘ compi-oin'ise_ or
half-way measures .would solve the
problem. ' -.
H I Personalities Clashed

As to the problein itself, no better
explanation, was brought to light than
the one thatclaimed that -merely "two

V‘-dominant personalities clashed, and
failed to agree ‘on. problems affecting
the interests of both.

W. Don Harrison has done a ﬁne
job as director of athletics in fulﬁll-
ing all.-the requirements of an ath-
letic director with the exception of
cooperating in ‘some respects with one
of the most vital" persons to the Uni-
versity, Dr. John Bain Sutherland. Two
dominant characters clashed, and the
stronger of the ‘two triumphed. _

It is expected that Dr. Sutherland
will announcehis-new assistant coach-
es to replace Bill Kernand Dr. Eddie
Baker, who were signed to coach at
Carnegie Tech in the recent athletic
department shake-up at that institu-
'-tion.‘ It is also reported that Dr. Ralph

.‘lMy throat welcomes Luckies -- my favorite

An independent survey was made recently
among professional men and women-lawyers,
doctors, lecturers, scientists, etc. Of those who said
they smoke cigarettes, more than 87% stated they
personally prefer a light smoke.

Miss Hopkins veriﬁes the wisdom of this pref-
erence, and so do other leading artists of the
radio, stage, screen and opera. Their voices are
their fortunes. That’s why so many of them
smoke Luckies. You, too, can have the throat pro-
tection of Luckies—a light smoke, free of certain S \
harsh irritants removed by the exclusive process
"It’s Toasted”. Luckies are gentle on the throat.

cigarette for 5 years”

“Luckies, have been my favorite cigarette
for about 5 years. They’ re a light smoke
that sensitive throats welcome. Of the
many trends that sweep through Holly-
wood, one of the longest lasting has been
the preference for Luckies. I once asked
a ‘property’ man—who supplies ciga-‘
rettes to the actors—what the favorite is.

‘He answered by opening up a box con-
taining cigarettes. They were all Luckies.”

 Today 5 Want-Ad ,
HERE is ‘just one final way that the under-
graduates can show, their support to the

"“57l'a'l:est’n1ov’é« tl‘1"at]'plac'e's Dr. John‘ B. Sutherland
. in complete control of_ the football destinies of

the University. Students can do a great deal if
they back up -Dir. Sutherlandpone hundred per-
cent by en‘cou‘«'rag-ing possible candidates to re-
port, or report themselves, for the first and
opening s'e's'sion of the spring training season to-
dayyat the Stadium. There is plenty of opportunity
for any -boy who desires to play football, and it
should be Emphasized that it is not necessary for
th'e.p'rospective candidate to have high school or
prep school experience. ‘ _ - - -

, One of the best tackles in Pitt history, Ave
Daniell, reported four years ago wi‘th~onl‘y the
oorest sort of a high school record behind him.
_ e,w‘a.s,wil1in'g and eager to learn, and thus im-
proved faster than any man on the squad during
his ﬁrst two years. Last fall, Daniell played as
one and smart a game at tackle as any player in
the entire country. His name will be recorded in

- University history along with the earlier All-
Americans; He is only one of the many examples" ‘

or Pitt football men who made good. on sheer
.P.éf3,i,§t§ncy ’a_nd_des‘ire to’ play“ the game.

Today the Pitt squad-—st-ands -approxima-tely---

forty strong, hardly ‘enough for three complete
teams. D:rI"_ utherland _‘needs_ at least sixty men
if it .is,:ex_pe‘cted that Pitt will stayiat the top in
footbalol. _A1thoug'h.the_; opening game ‘is still ‘some,
six. i‘ho_lnths ‘off. .t,1.0_.\.Y."iS"_t,.h.e, time that jthe successes
or-failures of t"-he 1937 fall season are determined.

The u'hderg'r‘a_clua'te’s must cooperate at‘-' this time
In ’providing‘ Dr. Sutherland with the..:‘o'pp'ortuni- ‘

ties -to keep Pitt at the top. If. we want a good
footbalgi team at this University, .then'_,su,fficient
undergraduates should‘ con’tinu"e to play the game.
Let’s"see' that Pitt con"t'i‘n_ues to socl:-it-to-‘em on
the gridiron next fall by building up this 1937
squad; _' ’ -

the bitter with the bet-to-1', ev§]}§'(ivCl£-llly if you come in just
after “Wom-an Al-one,” or just before “Brcez1n.g Ho-me.”

“We-m.a.n Alone” is an E:1~g*l:is!h picture, but not a mu~
s-ical comedy. Consequently it’s good. You may be a
li-ttl-e in the fog tow-ards the start, what xvitlw. blcnyn
fuses and stuff, but you’ll catch on in about ﬁve mm-
utes. It’%s a story of sazbo-targe and its only weakness
is a 1‘ea.son Wllly. _

No Stings In Wings -

The Fulton is stuck with “Wings of the Morning”.
It is also an En-glish picture and it proves t’l1.a«t the Eng-
lisrli either do t-hiynugs very well or else.’ All thru the
picture I kept hoping for the ncwsreels. You see “Wings
of the lllornineg” is a. travelogue with a plot 1;liro=wn
in, and I don’-t like t1"a.velo»g‘uIe»s.

Pezrshaps-1, expected too much from “Lost Horizon”.
Oh, it’s not a bad picture, Far from it, it's a. very good
one and in places it was all anyone could want. But-_.
there were. spots, pa.r’oi~cularly in the middle of the ﬁlm.

the first ﬂoor in State Hzall. is one of the ﬂuent libraries
of its kind in the conmtry. It ‘tn the opinion of The

_ News Art Critic
With each batch of magazines received and every new
book plirv.-l1a.<c(l, the Department of Fine Arts Library
is forp;i1ip.' ahead to l)P,('.om(‘. one of the most authorita-
tive 1'9.so.m'cl1 lalioratorics in its field.
’ The lib1‘a.ry was first established in the fall of .192
by Dr. Frederick M. Cl-app, lie:-.d of the Department of
At the present

3-4.662 pliotographs, and approximately 20,0_00 lantern
slides used in clas‘sroo:.n work. Recently; over 400 col-
lotype color reproductions of the old masters were pur-
chased.

in adtlition, the dv.=p9.rtment subscribes to 60 monthly
n1a,r:a:r.inc—.s and bulletins that range in subject matter
from .~:chola1‘l.y treatises on Cretan excavations t0 Pl-lb‘
licity for the raclical “alt with a purpose” pages of the
Communist-sponsored “Art Front.”

If you were to go to the Vatican and ask to see
ori9;inal ﬁrs!-. editions of Virgil’s works or other valued
r.v1z-Inn:-:c1'ipts in the Pope’s lib1*.:u'_v, you would either be
sent. to police sut,hor.ities or, more likely, you would be
shown printecl facsimilies of the works for which you
had asked. The Fine Arts Libra1'.y owns many of these
valuable facsiniilies. complete with board covers, worm
holes, seriﬁed m.r2.nuscript, and occasional ink blots where
the wearierl monks and scribes slipped up in their work.

“Aside from the air of schola-riness they give to the
library, the?‘-e facsimile manuscripts are most interest-
ing reading,” c0mment.r.=d Miss Sara St. John, librarian
in the depart.men_t. “The brisk little illuminations on
the pa§_z‘P_3 are accurate commentaries on the -life of the
pciplc, and much of our knowledge of medieval condi-
tions was obtained by histor-ions from these books.”

The clepartment also has one of the largest oriental
art refere.nce collections in the country. Done on pleas-~
ing cloth color combinations, Japanese artists depict the
fables of l-‘noir land in nervous little wash drawings that
read from H;_:ht to left. Occasionally, the artist w1‘ite-s
a moral that the story is supposed to bring out, and then
there. follo‘-vs a.not.he1~ long series of pictures.

In lino with the theory that art and human develop-
ment are inevita.l)l_v entwined, the library is equipped
with .=-.l:an'-:1a1‘c1 reference works. The big‘Encycloipedia
Italiane, s.low1y usurping the top ranking position -of the
Encyclopedia Britannica in the minds of most l'llSt()_l'lal1S,
is the only one on the campus at the present time. It
contains articles on Pittsburgh and the Point, an illus--
trated history of Maryland, and the article on Fascism
written by its outstanding exponent, Benito Mussolini.

The lib1‘a1‘_v facilities are available to University stu-
dents at all times.
