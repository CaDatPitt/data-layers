Every Game a Victory-—Bellevue High and E.
L.'A. Added to String.

The Freshmen basket ball team of-
fers a singular contrast to their foot-

-ball squad. The football team, with

all due regard to the_spirit, shown
its
class, was far from a howling suc-
cess, while the basket ball team seems
to have been getting the jump on its
opponents ‘from the very first. All
the games played have been closely
contested and won by narrow margins

‘and every victory, registered’ was the
result of clean hard playing.. Two -‘

more victories were annexed during
vacation, one with Bellevue High
School and the other with East Lib-
erty Academy.

The game with Bellevue High was
won 26 to 21. The Fresh kept in the
lead from start to ﬁnish, andiwere
never i11 danger of being headed.

The Freshmen class in the school
of medicine has at the presnt time an
enrollment of 48 members, of. which
number 21 are college graduates. The
remaining members are all graduates
of the leading high and preparatory
schools. -Possibly‘ no feature of the
rejuvenation of the medical college is
so worthy of comment as this fact:
Certainly the day of high standards
for the medical profession is at hand
when, within the comparatively short
space of two years our "school shows
almost 50 per cent of its members to
be college graduates.

The medical Freshmen are taking
all their anatomy and histology in the
new building on the hill. The labora-
tories and thedissecting rooms are
without peer in this country, it is
said._ The dissecting roomincludes
the entire top ﬂoor of Pennsylvania
Hall, being lighted exclusively by
skylights. -In. the histology labora-
tory each student has his own desk
and apparatus. The chemical labora-
tories are equally as adequate, but are
not quite ready for the possession. of
the students. Chemistry work is be-

ing done at the school of pharmacy
until the medical laboratories
completed.

began in the college, schools of en-

The usual opening day formality
was in evidence in all departments-

STANDARD AND ITS EFFECT.

ln the news columns of the present
‘issue appears an item relative to the
Freshman medical class in the _Uni—
'versity and the salient feature of "the

;per cent of the men enrolled are col-
lege graduates. Duringvthe “st two
iyears, our medical school, along with
l'the leading institutions of its kind has
lbeen conducting an earnest campaign
ifor the raising of entrance require-
[ments. The success of the efforts in
iour case is best attested by the ﬁgures
{given in the previously mentioned
lstory. Still further mention is made
lof the far-reaching cry of standard in
lthe item given in this issue, which re-
lports the statement of a leading den-
ltist made in V\/ashington, D. C., last
lweek at a convention. The day has

lundoubtedly come when the doctor,

land the dentist must have an education
lsufﬁcient to carry on their work
among all classes. with a dignity be-
ﬁtting the profession. In the long
Iago it was a good doctor or a good
dentist, who could administer a bit-
ter dose of _medicine or extract a
tooth in ‘the most painful manner. To-

medical man and the dentist must
have the qualification of an academic
education, as well as the knowledge
of his chosen profession. It is, in-
,deed, cheering to note that our own
iinstitu'tion is rapidly making steps in
ithat direction and will shortly dem-
ionstrate toithe country at large the

_ Intercollegiate Socialist Society
Met in Annual Convention Last
Week.

The Christmas holiday offered an
event of considerable note and much
linterest to collegians in the form of
[the second annual convention of the
-i Intercollegiate Socialist Society, held
in New York City on Thursday:and
;Friday, December 29-30.

l The New York Alumni Chapter en-

,opened the meeting, at which reports
!from the delegates of the various

;dress on “What Socialism Is,” by John
,‘Spargo,,author of “The Bitter Cry of
fthe Children,” “Socialism,” etc., and

ferail discussion. ‘ '

The culminating feature of the con-
ference was the dinner on Friday
evening at 6:30 o’clock at Kalil’s Res-

qtaurant, l6 Park Place. The topic for

gthe evening was “The Place of Col-
,lege Men and VVomen in the Socialist

  A Few Changes,

Fast Football Season Shows a?
Big Deficit--President Moffati
Reports to the-Trustees of the
College.

According to football men who
have been present at conferences held
recently in W/ashiiigton, Pa., and
wh_ich were participated in by Presi-
dent Moffat and ‘others high in col-
lege councils, three alternatives pre-
sent themselves to the VVashington§
and Jefferson authorities for the re—l
lief of a bad football situation. These 
men say that W. & J. must so in-4
crease the caliber of its schedule and}
arrange games of such attractiveness]
at points where the attendance will
be increased that the receipts will be

tees to such an extent thatall games

realized through a reduction of oper-
ating expenses; or eliminate the game
entirely as an intercollegiate propo-
sition and substitute, for it something
that can be carried on inexpensively.

The reason for the contemplated
changes in the conducting of the
major sport at W. & J. was the ﬁnan-
cial disaster experienced during the
season of 1910. That VV. & J. drop-

intimated to the public in Dr. Moffat’s
report to the trustees. That the col-
lege president made footballthe sub-
ject of a report is in itself considered
signiﬁcant among football men.
President l\loffat’s statement to the
trustees showed that the football
treasury showed a deﬁcit to date of
$1,700. Of this amount $1,000 was in-
curred during the 1910 "season. This
is the biggest deﬁcit that one football
season. has shown in W. & J. in years.

Ragtime College
Men’s' Favorite

President Lowell of Harvard,
Also
Cheering.

.-\ denunciation of organized college 7
cheering and “ragtime,” by President ‘

A. Lawrence Lowell, of Harvard Uni-

versity, was. the feature of the second
day's sessions of the Music Teach_-

ers’ National Association at Boston
University last week. President Low-
ell said:

One of the saddest things is to go

to a gathering of educated men—s.ay
college men, or even -alumnI———and

note the kind of music given at their
It is ragtime, and ragtime
of a very‘poor quality.

These men seem to care very little
for good music. VVhat they want is a
catchy song, after they have exhaust-
ed their voices in organized cheering.

Organized cheering has less means

of expressing degrees,and varieties ofl

emotion than any other form of ex-
pression, with the possible exception
of the foghorn. In some ways it ex-
presses the direction of the taste of

cultivated people today. Our people‘ -
seem totally deficient in expressing in 

common any of ’the finer emotions.
One can hardly fail to note the pro-
gressive degeneracy of the popular
taste in music.

A gathering of educated persons
should naturally have a ﬁne expres-
sion for their emotions through mu-
sic. Music teachers, therefore. have
a task before them that affects our
whole civilization. This work is the
good ‘teaching of music from child-
hood upward, and in raising the mu-
sical taste of the people in general.
