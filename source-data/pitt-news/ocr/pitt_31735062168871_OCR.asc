Volume 64, NO. 14

by PEGGY ALLEN

Student Government (SG) has
passed a resolution that will safe-
guard the legal rights of each

‘and every student. The bill, pass-

ed Wednesday night, will estab-
lish a Legal Awareness Commit-

' tee (LAC), which will provide

guidance to students with disci-
plinary problems at the Unversi-
ty and to students with legal
problems in the civil courts.

SG President K e n Schueler
stressed the importance of the bill.
“There is gross ignorance on the
part of the students as to what
their rights really are. This com-

mittee can refer students to a -

group of lawyers who can advise

them of their rights.”

This service will be applied to
students involved in civil cases

_ and to students involved in Uni-

versity disciplinary cases. Pre-
sently, a student involved in a
disciplinary case has no where to
turn for advice. The committee
would be able to explain the dis-

for appeals. and any other means
of defense open to the student.

The committee could also in-

form students of their rights in
civil courts and, if necessary, re-
fer them to a professional legal
counsel. “I’d like to see this reach

"the point where someone busted

for pot can just call and get leg-
al advice,” stated Schueler. “Stu-
dents in trouble don’t know where
to turn—that’s real alienation.”

The LAC will also help to set

‘up judicial processes within the

University community and, if ne-
cessary, help to restructure the
old judicial systems. Men’s Men’s
Dorm Council or AWS, for ex-
ample, could set up letal proce-
dures guaranteeing
the right to have witnesses, ample
time to prepare their cases and
the right to appeal to a" higher
authority. These rights do not
now exist.

will take effect immediately.

New course registration proce-
dures were recently’ formulated
by the Advising Center and the
brand new SG Committee on Aca-
demic Procedures. The new rules
will take effect immediately for
the upcoming Winter Term.

The student will schedule ap-
pointments and meet with his ad-
visor as in the past. In addition to
selecting his new courses. the stu-
dent will indicate an alternate
course for each course selected
when registering each term with
his advisor. If the studentsfirst
choice is not available. the Reg-
istrar would then enter the stu-
into his alternate choice
without the student having to se-

   
 
  

process immediately. After the
student has filled out the neces-
sary form, he will carry it to Stu-
dent Records. At Student Records,
each course will be checked while
the student waits to seeif there is
room for him in the selected class.

ing term.

Another bill, one which dealt
with co-operative housing. was.
and was, according to Ken Schuel-
er. “probably one of the most im-
portant stands SG could take on
housing." The bill will establish
a temporary Committee on Co-
operative Housing and provide
for representatives to be sent to
the Co-operative Housing Con-
ference, Washington, D. C.

Co-operative housing, accord-
ing to Schueler, gives studetns
the “freedom to experiment with
their own lives and to creatively
decide what they’re going to do
with them.” Students are respon-
sible for the ownership and man-
agement of the co-ops and have
the opportunity to run their own
lives.

Co-operative housing can also
cut living costs. For example, stu-
dents can decide whether or not
they wantgthe cost of maid serv-
ice or of a food service. They may
also furnish their rooms as they
please. Dormitory housing often
fails to provide “for basic human
needs such as privacy, territorial-

ity, and comfort.“ w 

SG passed two other bills. The

first, A Bill Concerning the 18.

Year Old Vote, sets up a system
to petition the student body on
this issue. The seeondl, A Bill on
Papers and Quizzes and Tests,
proposed that a letter be sent to
all deans asking that they notify
their various faculties that no pa-

 pers, quizzes, or tests are to be

due or given on any religious

- holiday ordurirrg any University
S gsponsored activities. '

‘ David Ehrenwerth, chairman of
the Committee on Academic Pro-
cedures, announced the changes
to be made in registration. Under
the new system, students will
have their registration forms com-
pletely processed within ten min-
utes. Seniors will be permitted to
register first.

Ken Schueler annouced two ap-
pointments to the Faculty Senate
Committee on Educational Poli-
cies. They are Ed Levine, presi-
dent of the Engineering Cabinet,
and Joe Kociubes. head of the
Academic Cabinet. '

ments to make time schedules
available prior to the beginning
of the registration period for the
next two terms. He hopes to have

Oct. 17 for Winter Term registra-
tion.

Seniors will be rgistered be-

take place the week of Oct. 21.
All other students will begin reg-

dean of the College of Arts and
Sciences, pointed out that some
departments will not be able to

Blasts Old Policies

by DON MARBURY
Staff Feature Editor

“All the presidential candi-
dates define law and order,” said
Julian Bond, 28-year-old head of
the Georgia Freedom Delegation
at the Democratic Convention.
“The only differences in their
definitions is that if you sit in
front of George 'Wallace’s car
he will run over you. While if
you sit in front of Nixon’s car he
will have his chauffeur run over‘.
you over. And Vice President
Hurnphreywill cry while he runs
over you.”

In his Thursday afternoon talk a
-in the Student Union Ballroom,

Bond said that Georgia Governor
Lester Maddox loves to speak to
groups of young people. “In fact,”
Bond remarked, “he might have
been speakinghere today, if it

weren’t‘ for an awful tragedy that

took place in his home. His li-

brary caught on fire, and» both-of.

his books burned.

“But what made it so tragic,_’,’
Bond went on, “was, that _they
weren’t even -colored in yet.’.’

Bond, dressed in a business-
like manner, quipped that there
was going to be a new -series on

television this year, basedgon the '

_ Bond recognized the fact that

there have been improvements‘ in-

said that he "realized that the
Black population could not eat in
places that they hadn’t been al-

  An Opportunity

Students are always complaining about the inequities
that exist within our University community. We complain
about the lack of student influence in University decision
making; we complain about some of our social regulations;
_ we complain about the football team; we complain about our
“insignificant education.” Above all, we complain about ad-

- ministrative inertia. -

This institution is packed with a student body of chronic
complainers—people who sit back and let their resentment
grow. They are dissatisfied with the University environment,
but are unwilling to take the time to become “active”—un-
willing to participate in the processes that ultimately brings
out changes.

A great deal of this back seat driving is due to a serious
case of ignorance. This is not really an ignorance of mental
spirit, but. an ignorance of the vital information that affects
the course of each student’s living pattern at the University.

This ignorance can only cause student complacency, and
student complacency can only cause administrative inertia.
One organ that will hopefully solve part of the student lack
of awarness on campus is the newly created Legal Aware-
ness Committee (LAC). If things run smoothly, the LAC will
not only insure the basic rights of"students involved in dis-
ciplinary cases,’ but will serve as an instrument of legal learn-
ing that will give students a basic conception of their legal
rights.

Another newly passed Student Government resolution
may foster a new student awareness in the future. The bill
advocates the principle of University Cooperative Housing—
a principle that theoretically and practically demonstrates
student responsibility and awareness. This, of course, is a
functional awarness—the awareness of deed.

But Cooperative Housing and the LAC are merely pics
in the sky if the student body neglects its basic responsibil-
ities—the responsibility of a citizen in the University com-
munity. The LAC will flop unless students are willing to rec--
ognize it as a legitimate organ of action. In fact, any com-
mittee of any student organization will flop if the consti-
tuency of this community is not willing to better its own
position.

The specter of University malaise is nothing new; it has
been hovering over us for years. In past years, this malaise
has poisoned our minds, giving us a “devil may care atti-
tude.” This spirit may persist this year. It will persist if
students are unwilling to take the iniative—the iniative to par-
ticipate in the molding of their own lives and futures.

One sure way students can do this is to attend the Speak
Your “Peace” conference scheduled for tomorrow. Perhaps
an all day conference scheduled for a Saturday is not attrac-
tive to most students; perhaps the idea of a speakout is not
attractive; perhaps the idea of student involvement is not
essentially attractive. But if students fail to attend this con-
ference, we might as well give up for good. If students don’t
give a damn, they don’t deserve the rights for which they
strive.

The problems of this University can be neatly put into
the paradoxical classification of responsibility vs. irresponsi-
bility. A community of irresponsible citizens is always beset
by decay, while those communities blessed with a responsi-
ble citizenry are viable and progressive.

Beards, Bards, And Bugles
‘Make’ America This Year

by GEORGE LIES
Associate Editor

America seems to be in one helluva mess.

But for a minute, let’s look past George Wal-
lace, Richard Nixon, and Hubert "Humphrey. Let’s
take a look at the attitude of the American people.

The so-called older generation is disgusted with
student demonstrations; while moral issues and tax-
es just turn them off.

The so-called younger generation is disgusted
with the rigid restrictive obligations established by
reality. At the same time, they face transition in
life; their problems (to them- = '
selves) are bigger than any prob-
lem anyone has ever had any- “
where, anytime. '

THE SO-CALL_E_D middle-mid-
dle-middle class isconfused, split ;
by suspicions and doubts brought O
about by Wallace on one side, and
by security and economy brought
about by Nixon and Humphrey on ,
the other side.

The Black Americans, who were
aided by the white liberals to
achieve integration, now want
segregation. They've got the chance they have al-
ways wanted, and now they, rightfully so are go-
ing to make the best of it.

The so-called intellectuals aren’t going to vote
because there is no choice. They plan to shun ev-
erything, strenghts that gave them their chance, and
just go on talking and idealizing.

BEARDS, BARDS, bangles, balloons, beads, and
-bugles, that’s what Americans seem to be made. of
this election year. “A funny thing about this coun-
try,” said a close, close comrade of yore, “this coun-
try will go on-n-n, and on. It doesn’t matter who is
President. This country runs itself, baby.” (Ap-

   

LIE S

plause.)
That comment. unmistakeably tells it like it is.

But right now this country is caught in spiraling
change, and everybody. but everybody wants
change, betterment for themselves. Everybody dem-
onstrates. (This no doubt comes from the unions
who have to strike to get change. This is the reality
of group force: much like that of hecklers and Chi-

cago police.)

IT COULD BE very easily said that this coun-
try is too liberal, and what it needs over the next
four years is justified conservatism.

Justified because this conservatism must be in-
acted to direct_ all the liberalism which has sprout-
ed in the past several years. It cannot be a conserva-
tism that stifles and aborts everything.

Four years of conservatism might not sound too
exciting, but if it can utilize the liberal accomplish-
ments already established, the next four years may
be more worthwile and more fruitful.

Let’s face it, both Democrats (losers this year)
and Republicans (the winners?) have chosen so-
called safe candidates. Humphrey talks and talks;
Nixon plots and plots. But which one reflects the
conservatism needed? Which one is the best or-
ganizer? Which one dictates and which one takes
orders?

PRESENTLY, Nixon is on the offensive. He
plays the part of the next President of the United
States. Humphrey, reacting to the polls, is on the
defensive. He plays the part of the underdog.

Between the two poles of reality is Wallace, 76
million people who will vote, and President Lyndon
Johnson.

Of course, Johnson is a history unto himself. But
76 million people who care (who will vote) will be
trying to start a new history in November.

That’s when (even if some are giving—up) the

voters have a chance to fix the fix America is in.

by HOBART HARRIS

At exactly midnight, one week
after Chicago, Hubert Horatio
Humphrey made an appointment
with the devil. His choice had
been a hard one, his religious be-
liefs had given him a good fight,
but it couldn’t be helped. The
polls said he was losing.

Satan, sensing the capture of a
real prize, prepared carefully for
the meeting. Calling in his best
interior decorators, he complete-
ly redid his offices in the best
style. Downfrom behind his desk
came the “The South Shall Rise
Again” poster (George Wallace
had been in to see him just the
week before), his rare gun collec-
tion was taken from its racks and
replaced with a model of the new-
est ghetto high school that Wash-
ington hadn’t built, and an auto-

graphed picture of Franklin Roo-

sevelt was placed over his Watts
Sluggers.

FINALLY the moment came.
His secretary called in to say that
Mr. Humphrey was waiting to see
him. Walking to the door to greet
his guest, the Devil stopped at the
mirror to see that his “Give a

_ Damn” button was on securely.
" Practicing saying, “The police

were forced to react in Chicago
because the candidate’s lives had
been threatened,” with a straight
face, he opened the door and
shook hands with his visitor.

“Mr Humphrey,” he said, “how

really nice to see you. Its always.
a_. pleasure to talk to you (politi-

“It’s a pleasure to meet y o u
also,” Humphrey said. “I’ve heard
a lot about you from my friends.”

“You’re too kind,” the Devil re-
plied.

“AS YOU 'KNOW,I haven’t
been doing too well this last week,
and I’d like a little advice on how
to get my campaign rolling,”
Humphrey stated. “I just can’t
understand it. I've been taking a
beating on almost every issue that
has turned up. Take Law and Or-
der. Wallace and Nixon have been
calling for increased police pow-
er, the ending of riots, and shackl-
ing of the Supreme Court. Now I
know that they can get votes that
way, but I don’t intend to win by
appealing to fear and racism, and
I have said so in speech after
speech. Sooner or later I hope
that people will begin to listen to
me.” - .

“Very commendable,” the Dev-
il agreed. “What do you intend to
do after your criticisms start to
take effect?”

“AS SOON as I get Nixon and
Wallace good and scared, I’m
going to call for increased Police
Power, ending of the riots, and
shackling of the Supreme Court,”
Humphrey grinned.
the people are so scared of the
blacks that they’ll vote for any-
body that wants to put, them
down. There’s no reason that I
shouldn’t get some of those votes
just because Wallace thought of
Law and Order first. I’m a Law
and Order man, was ever since
I was the Mayor of Minneapolis.”

“But thats not my only prob-4

lem,”’ Humphrey lamented. “I
don’t think that people think that

I am a’ Liberal any rnore; At ev-

“After all, ‘

  

the things that I did in 1948 and
1956. And I tell them that I was
the one that thought up the Peace
Corps. But most of all, I tell them
about my opinions about current
problems. Take Vietnam. Before
the convention, when I wasn’t
sure that Mayor Daley would
support me, I took the stand that
there can be no retreat before
Communist aggression. After the
convention, when I wanted Sena-
tor McCarthy’s support, I called
for a bombing halt. What more
could they want?”

“BUT MOST of all, I’m upset
that I haven’t excited the support
of theyyoung people of this coun-
try. I just can’t understand it.
Wallace says they’re Communists.
Nixon calls them Hippies. I tell
them that I encourage responsible
dissent. But the more I say it the
more they come and demonstrate
and shout_and try to‘ get me de-
feated,” Humphrey moaned. “I’ll
tell you something. If these Hip-
pies and Communists don’t start
behaving I’m going to give it to
them just like we did in Chicago.”

“Well, I think you’ve got a
very sound program going for
you,” the Devil said. “I couldn’t
think of anything better myself.”
Glancing at his watch, the Devil‘.
saw that his next visitor was due
in five minutes. “Why don’t you
drop by next week and we’ll have
another talk?”

“THANK YOU very much, Mr.
Humphrey said. “I don’t get en-
couragement ve ry ‘much these
daysfi

Then there was a pause.

Finally, Mr. Humphrey took
out his check book. “Uh, how
much will this cost?” he asked.

“Oh, that’s a common miscon-
ception about our service,” the

,Devil chuckled. ‘‘All _of .our cli-

Speak For All

Editor, The Pitt News

The editorial, “Superficiality,”
that appeared in the Oct. 4 edition
of the Pitt News attacked the typi-
cal stereotypes of college life
that our parents, according to
the editorial, have. While many
of these sterotypes are far from
the truth, the image of today’s
college life at Pitt, as pictured in
the editorial, was also a gross
misreprentation of the truth. Mr.
Stoller makes the all too common
error of believing that his views
accurately reflect those of most
Pitt students. The typical Pitt
student, according to Mr. Stoller,
shows his distaste for American
life and values by growing long
hair and beards (the boys, that
is), smoking pot, or by joining
“radical” organizations. Typical
Pitt students “don’t have a
strong faith in God . . . and have
lost their faith in our democra-
tic system.” Yes, and we are all
firmly opposed to the “immoral”
war in Vietnam too. Do you, typi-
cal Pitt student, fit this descrip-
tion? For most, the answer is,
“No.”

There is much student opposi-
tion, and rightly so, to those in
“The Establishment” who at-
tempt to tell us how to think. But

isn’t this editorial subtly doing.

the same thing. A university is
supposed to be a Liberal institu-
tion, but this term has a bouble
meaning. At Pitt, at least to most
professors and to the “articulate
minority” as represented by the
editor and his staff, liberal does
not mean “free to think,” but,
,,left of center.’-’ I certainly res-
pect Mr. Stoller, or anyone else’s
right to voice their opinion, but
please don’t attempt to speak for
all Pitt students, for that is a feat‘
which no one person can ever hope
to accomplish.

Concerning David Rosenbloom

There is an ever present need
for people seeking medical care

and who play to request that all
or partial payment for the care be

paid by a third party (Blue Cross-
Shield or commercial insurance)
to be able to give the provider
(s) of the medical care informa-
tion about that third party. Thus!
students who will be getting medi-
cal care in Pittsburgh and else-

have at hand pertinent informa-
tion about their medical cover-
age — or about their parent’s cov-
erage if they are included under
it.

I This should include the master

policy has been issued, the name of

(for Blue Cross covered residents
of this County it is, for example,
Blue Cross of Western Pennsy-

the effective date of the policy,

Pennsylvanian Answers Haller 

Editor, The Pitt News

In regard to David Hal1er’s let-
ter, published in the Pitt News
on Sept. 30, I would like to make
two points clear.

First of all, Mr. Haller has in-
sulted all Pennsylvania students
by stating that he “picked the Uni-
versity for more academic reasons
than their (other out-of state
students) ‘in-state’ classmates.”

Lowering the tuition has not al-
tered the academic goals of the
University or of the Pennsylvania
students who have long recogniz-
ed Pitt’s academic excellence.
Lower rates have made it possible
for more qualified Pennsylvania
students to enter the University

than ever before, and I feel l:lia_t‘:.'
Mr. Haller should realize that”
all the students of this Univer-.
sity are represented by the State T
Legislature while they are attend- ;
ing classes in a state-related uni- 

versity.

Secondly,
realize that all

I say that if Mr. Haller doesn’t. ,,
want to pay 200 per cent more
than Pennsylvania students he:
should return to one of his own?-’
state schools where he’ll neither
have to pay high prices nor be 7
bothered -with the Pennsylvania 

Legislature!

Personal Political View

by JOHN NIRENBERG

 George Wallace is an intolerable, insensitive, indiscrimin-
ate, invidious, insecure, incredulous, uninformed, archaic, con-
 temptible, pseudo-politician Without the depth or character or
perception or talent or capabilities or sincerety to be a Senate

George Wallace, the transplanted heart of Dixie, inter-
"rupted his remarks at the Civic Arena last week to re-assure his sup-
porters in the audience that after he is elected President in November

they will see little of the “Communists and anarchists” who disrupted
parts of the rally with vocal protests to Wallace.

philosophy, have passed by his
grasp.

WALLACE HAS shown that a
large segment of our population
doesn’t care about the whys and
hows of the race problem, the
cities, Vietnam, welfare, and the
apparently necessary expanse of
the Federal Government.

To the former Governor of Ala-
bama who once encouraged Fed-
eral spending in his state, the
Federal Government should sud-
denly cut back its programs
which now provide funds for 10-

" cal boards of education, hospitals,

welfare agencies and others with
no strings attached. His solution
is to ignore a problem instead of
confront it. His solution is to cre-
ate 50 separate nations within
one boarder. His solution to the
problems he attacks is to destroy
instead of create, to further di-
vide instead of unite. I

George Wallace is the product
of a disease which is spreading
across the United States. He is as-
sembling the worst elements of
our society by appealing to‘ the
fears, anxieties, hatred, frustra-
tions, ignorance, and insecurities
of our weak, materialistic, selfish,
uncompromising, population.

He is succeeding in dividing
us.

The Wallace Rally was an-
other experiment in insanity as
the «two extremes tested each
other’s patience. Yet neigher ex-
treme is the answer to the prob-
lems ‘we face. It is obvious that
Wa1lace’s appearance was more

, than emotional, it was an hyster-

ical appeal to the animosity and
the contempt brewed in an ear
void of compassion and a mind
of intelligence.

all the heroes gone?

A young woman cries out her agony to
The Brooklyn sky '

As good citizens dim their lights

50 they may watch unseen

The late show in the streets.

A pregnant mother is harassed by hoodlums
While spectators stand mutely by.

And the young men? A

The young men stand aside

;Too smart to get involved.

In the current lingo they ”keep their cool”.
Well, listen here

No great civilizations have been built

By men whokept their cool . . .

No frontiers conquered

No revolutions waged

No brave new socIeties forged

By men who kept their cool. a

All of mankind's shining achievements
Have been propelled into being

By hot-blooded young men, fired by an idea.
When the heroes take to the sidelines
Civilizations decline and disappear.

Right now this country needs heroes

To stick out their necks

For better schools

Better housing

Better government.

U N ow  . It’,s Up To All University, Students r

Speak’ Your Peace is a conference" established by students for
students. It is not run, or organized by any special student group or
student interest. It has been organized for students of this University
so that they may discover what’s happening here.

It is what may be the only chance for students to meet and talk
with professors, and administrators the entire year.

Tomorrow, beginning at the very early hour of 8:45 a.m., the stu-
dents get their chance. The chancellor starts things off at that time,

CHAN CELLOR. POSVAR.

a coffee hour follows, and then its discussion groups after that.

  Student Government:  

A New Look Or Old?

What is the function of Student Govern-
ment at the University? What are its respon-
sibilities to the student body and the Uni-
versity community? What can students expect
from Student Government‘? ' i

The student body has the right to expect
its elected representatives to serve it responsi-
bly and effectively; to study and act upon
issues of concern to students and to actively
solicit student opinion on these issues. Is
student government presently performing
these functions? Many students feel that it is
not.

MANY STUDENTS FEEL that SG is a
shame; only an intricate structure with no
life or activity within. Are these students not

wrong? What has SG given the students?
How has SG reflected [what is on students’

minds? There have been debates’ and opti- I

mism and enthusiasm;- there exists a genuine
desire on the part of the executive and the
senate to govern the student body intelli-
gently and reform the University for the bene-.

fit of faculty antlmadministration as well as
students. - -

Has Student Government really remain-
ed impotent? There are many reasons, all of
which have been cited a thousand times;
students don’t care about SG, students don’t
support SG, SG is preoccupied with petty
politics, and similar rationalizations. But
these are true only in part. For the most part,
students are unsure; aboutfacts, policies, re-
presentatives and, above all, about what they
really want for themselves. ‘ P

IN ADDITION, the structure of Student
Government is obsolete. Student Government,
must be evaluated honestly and we must all
try to revamp the present structure if we are
to attain meaningful, effective government.

This is what the Speak Your Peace confer-
ence is all about; honest evaluation and ex-
change of ideasamong students, faculty and
administrators, so that we may all understand,

and hopefully overcome, the real obstacles,

thatstand in the way of effective communica-

tion, government and education.

  GTERS FACE ROOM SHORTAGE;
 WHAT CAN WE DO?

 

  TRAFFIC ‘TIMES’

The mostbasic concern of any organiza-
tion or activity at this University is to gen-
eratestudent interest and involvement, and
the question which arises invariably at
-organizational meetings is how can com-
muters be persuaded to participate. It
follows, then, that one of the major topics
of the Speak Your Peace conference this
weekend should be “The Commuter.”

A number of circumstances prevent com-
muters from becoming fully active on cam-

I pus,‘and one ought to ‘be acquainted with

. them before passing a hasty judgment.

T0 BEGIN with, the average commuter
~wastes 2 hours ‘a day traveling to and from
the University. If he comes by bus, he
_must endure the countless stops the bus
_, makes its final destination. Any com-

’ muter will, attest to the fact that driving
' to school requires half the time that a bus

‘does. However, looking for a place to

5 park and walking to and from that place

can addup to nearly as much time as the

‘ bus. '

A second consideration is‘ the availa-

. ability oftransportation. Many students do
* " not participate in -evening activities be-"

 

cause of the infrequency of bus service to
their area or because they have no place
to park in the evenings. '

THIRDLY, commuters, who may have
a desire to participate, have no knowledge
of what opportunities are available to them
or how to go about applying for positions
in various organizations. ‘

The Commuter Association has been
working on plans to alleviate these pro-
blems. However, everything will ‘hinge
on the position of the University and the
Port Authority on the issue of increased

and non-stop bus routes from various lo-

cales.

This will be the central issue at the con-
ference Saturday. A great deal of coopera-
tion and participation would be required
from commuters to make such a proposal
feasible. It would unite commuters ac-
cording to geographical areas to assist the
University and the Commuter Association
in planning the bus experiment.

Information concerning key pick-up
points, exact routes, numbers of interest-

, ed students, and, frequency of service. is ._ .
‘essential. ~ ' 7*   v’ . ="

For the past few years now, there has
been .a severeshortage of offcampus'hous-
ing in Pittsburgh. This condition leads,
in some‘ cases, to situations which should
not, and can’ not, be tolerated by the large
number of‘ students living off ,campus.
Conditions such as poor maintenance —
plumbing, wiring, gas, and other general re-
pairs — landlords not fulfilling agreements

. with lessees, etc., and high rent for low
living standards. ’

Conditions like these exist everywhere
that a housing shortage exists. However,
the environment for. their existence is en-
hanced by the fact that inexperienced stu-
dents go looking for apartments “cold.”
That is to say, they do not check with either
the Director of Housing or the Student
Government Off-Campus Housing Com-
mittee. If they did, they would be able

to get a better idea of the housing situa-
tion, I.E., the type of housing available
and inside information on some of the
landlords.

IN AN ATTEMPT to keep our informa-
tion on off—campus housing current, the SG
Off—Campus Housing Committee will,
again this term, be sending question-
naires to students living in apartments. We
will also be forming an Off—Campus As-
sociation.

This will be done by dividing the areas
of apartments up into sections, each sec-
tion having a representative to the SG
Off—Campus Housing Committee‘. When
ever a student has any kind of housing
trouble, he will then contact his area
representative, who will in turn, bring the
problem before the Committee, where ap-

propriate action will be taken.

—the disparity of costs. And out-of-state student must pay $1,-

600 a year in tuition, while an in-state student must pay
$650. ‘

-—The image shattering myth that the University is a state-
related school, and therefore the quality and prestpge of
the school is reduced. A

One of the major reasons for the slippage in the Univer-
sity’sr“cosmopolitan flux,” according to admissions officials,
is the disparity of tuition cost. Why should a student come to

. the University and pay $1,600, when he can receive a quality
education for $400 at a State University. ‘

y i An essential aspect of the admissions picture is the in-
creasingonumbers of black students on campus.

This statement," however, must be qualified, for today‘
black .students onlylcomprise one per cent of the undergrad-
uate population. ’

This disturbing percentage may be corrected by the
formation of black recruiting teams and programs such as
Project A. The University is also ‘attempting to solve this bas-
ic inequity by mapping many programs geared to the Black

community in the city and on campus. ‘ ‘ n ’ O ( I V __ . ,

British Debaters Meet
Pitt’s Debating Seniors

The 1968 British National De-
bate champions, Victor MacColl
and James Hutchison of the Uni-
versity of Strathclyde, will debate
the William Pitt Debating Union
at Pitt, Tuesday, in 144 CL.

Debating for Pitt will be Ken
Holecko, senior in history, and Vic
Papale, senior in political science.
The topic for the Parliamentary
(House of Commons style) debate
is Resolved: That the Politics of
the Streets are the Politics of
Weakness.

MacColl and Hutchison, repres-
enting their Glasgow, Scotland Uni-
versity, will be making the first
stop on their tour of the Eastern
US, which will extend until
early December.

The 24 year old MacColl is the
chairman of the Federation of

est political student organiza-
tion in the United Kingdom. He

Hutchison is a 20 year old senior
in political science. While attend-
ing St. John’s Primary School,
he wrote an article advocating
a student advisory council to as-
sist in the administration of the
school, which apparently resulted
in somethingof a turmoil. -

Papale and Holecko, the Presi-
dent and Vice-president of WPDU
will be opposing the resolution,
as the Loyal Opposition. The de-
bate is the first in a series of Par-
liamentary, public debates the Un-
ion hopes to hold this year.

After the initial four speeches,
the speaker.of the House, Profes-
sor Robert Newman of the Speech
Department, will open the debate

Friday, October 11, l968’—THE PITT NEws§¥i?ag¢:;ii:;

The Steve Baron Quartet, play-
ing in the Hunt Room coffee house
until Saturday from 9-1, has one of
the best gimmicks we’ve seen
around here in a long time——talent.
Their music is not only original
and not obstrusively loud, but pro-
vocative enough to be emotional-
ly satisfying and not mind—bending
or exhausting.

The Quartet includes Steve,
singer and guitarist; Jef Lowell
on electric guitar, whoalso sings,
Tom Winer, organist, pianist and
sometime clown; and Bill David-
son, lead guitarist. Steve writes
the music and lyrics.

One of the most immediately
striking things about the physical
appearance of the quartet’s mem-
bers is that they look like regular
guys: hip, but not ridiculous. They
don’t have acne or dandruff, don’t
wear dirty, crumpled clothes. Two
of them even wore TIES on. Mon-
day night.

Harriers Journey To
 Notre Dame Presents
 Tremendous Challenge

by BILL NAAB
, ~ Today’s Notre Dame Invitational appears to be the first
A ' truly tough test of the season for coach Jim Banner’s harriers.
It is certain that the distancemen, in order to continue winning,
must perform to their best ability. This rugged invitational will '
definitely Contrast the harriers’ previous meet, an easy victory over Cle-

veland State,

Coach Banner remarked that “The Notre Dame Invitational is
. usually very tough. There’s always lots of good runners. It’s going to be

a real tough meet.”

In _addition to the excellant
competition, injuries are another
reason why the meet should be

considered “real tough.” “Mark

Vomhagen definitely will not
.be there, and Ken Lawton is
sick,” said Banner.

He added‘ that Vornhagen has
a possible case of monomucleosis,
or hopefully a bad cold, or one
of several things. In addition,
Greg Rodgers has a sore foot,
although probably not serious.

As for Jerry Richey, he is ex-

” pected to have his hands full.
_ Banner commented, “he won’t

have an easy time. Naturally,
though, I look for him to win.”

Junior Paul Zink remarked that
even though the first three meets
weren’t very difficult, Richey is
really needed for the big meets.
Zink said, “It’s great to have
Jerry Richey on the squad. He’s
always right up there.”

‘ John Aiken and Bill Matajastic,

other harriers who hope to put the

‘squad on top, won the sixth and

Cook Uncle Ben’s Converted

by ART ROSENGARTEN

A surprising Syracuse team hosts the Pan-
thers tomorrow afternoon in ancient Arhci-
bold Stadium and from the way head coach
Ben Schwartzwalder has been talking, the
Orangemen are gunning for Pitt.

“Their goal is Pitt,” Schwartzwalder said.
“And when they set a goal for themselves, look
out!” Swartzwalder feels that Pitt has been raiding
his recruiting grounds, and the crusty old skipper
isn’t happy about it. ' _

As for the Panther’s pilot, Dave Hart views
this game as just another game on the schedule.
‘‘I wouldn’t approach this game any differently
than any other,” he firmly stated. “We want to
win this game as much as Navy or Air Force or any
of them.”

After viewing the Syracuse films of their vic-
tory over Maryland, Hart is not sure that this isn’t
the best team that Syracuse has had in a long time.
“They are more flexible in their attack and they
have been able to open up their offense with great
success,” he said.

“They are the best looking Syracuse offense
that I’ve ever seen,” he continued. “They’re do-
ing things that they have never done before.”

Going hand-and-hand with the offense has been
the Orange’s stingy defense. Ranked number 4 last
year in total defense, the defensive squad only
lost two of its starters thru graduation. “The de-
fense is the thing that keeps them going,” was the
way Hart put it. -

Against UCLA last week, the Orangemen’s de-
fense only allowed the Bruins 56 years rushing
compared to the 255 yards that the Panthers gave-
up. On the other hand, Syracuse rushed for 251
yards, while Pitt could only ground out 61 yards.

Hart looks at the Syracuse win over UCLA as a
possible blessing in disguise. “Syracuse’s beating
of UCLA should be an incentive to the boys to
redeem themselves for what they did on the coast,”
Hart said slightly optimisticly.

if

 

as rugged cross country competi-
tors. Banner warned. “Miami
(0.) has a well balanced squad,
and Western Michigan is always
one of the top NCAA cross coun-
try teams.”

Notre Dame, however, lacks
the characteristic depth present
in recent years. Senior captain Ke-
vin _O’Brien and junior Bob Wat-
son return from last year’s squad,
which finished 4-1-1 in dual -
meet competition. Banner re-
marked that “O’Brien is one of the
better milers in the NCAA.” Also,
Watson, in a spectacular sophomore
debut, set the Notre Dame course
record.

The harriers need be impress-
ive in their visit to South Bend,
if ‘they realistically, are to ap-
proach Jerry Richey’s goal of an
NCAA cross country champion-
ship in his first season as a var-
sity harrier. The NCAA cham-
pionships incidently won’t be
held until November 25th.

Despite the variety and excel-
lance of competition, coach Ban-
ner believes that his squad will
finish anywhere from the top to
third best. Still, he realizes
that illness and injuries could
hurt his chances in the flat, five
mile race. Nevertheless, Ban-
ner remains optimistic. He said,
“They believe in it. We know
every meet is important. pWe’re
shooting for them all.”

it

  

Pitt holds a slight edge over Syracuse in their
rivalry which dates back to 1961. Since then the
Panthers have won 11, lost 10, and tied twice. The
last time that Pitt won was in 1963, when a power-
ful team scored a 35-27 victory. Since then, Syra-
cuse has won four straight. The only other team on
the 0rangemen’s schedule to hold a winning ser-
ies record is Michigan State, which handed Syra-
cuse its only loss this season. a

In order to keep the series from becoming tied,
Hart has added a few new wrinkles to both the
offense and defense. Hart hopes to be able to open
up his offense, while letting his defense play a very
aggressive type of ball. .

“We must have a good balanced attack,” ex-
plained Hart. “I know that we won’t be able to get
away with only one play. We will have to play wide-
open football against them.”

Against William and Mary, Hart was able to
get away with one play. That one play was basically
Denny Ferris into the line. Ferris carried the ball
33 times for 137 yards. Hart doesn’t expect that
play to be as successful against the big, strong Syra-
cuse linemen.

Seeing more action this week will be the number
two tailback behind Ferris, Dave Garnett. Garnett,
an up-state New York boy, was one of the boys that
Schwartzwalder feels Pitt stole from him. Hart
hopes to be able to show Schwartzwalder just what
he lost.

“I plan to use Dave to return kick—offs and punts,
besides replacing Ferris,” explained Hart. “I just
hope he has a good game.”

Hart has also been planning to use some. boys
both ways, in order to take full advantage of these
boy’s abilities. End Bill Pilconis and offensive tack-
le “Ez” Ed Whittaker have been practicing going
both ways, and Hart hopes to have J. D. Lewis try
his hand at defense; _

Summing it up, Hart feels that ‘‘We’ve got to
be real aggressive if we’re going to win. It’s
either whip them or be whipped.” _

opponent is more reachable.

The man of Ben Schwartzwalder
are clearly the favorites. They
are labeled “better than last
year” by the experts and yet last
year they were, 8-2. ‘

The Orange defense ranks a-
mong the best in the nation.

Last year the Orange limited
their opponents to 12.7 points

per game; this year they have been 

stingier. In three games, Syra-
cuse has given up just 35 points,
highlighted by last week’s per-
formance against the speedy
Uclans.

And the Orange defense is hand-

led by experienced personel, with .

the exception of sophomore tack-
le Ray White. Ends Lou Gubitosa
and Steve Zegalia, middle guard
Gerry Beach, and tackle Art
Thomas complete the line that

stopped the Panthers cold in last '

year’s 14-7 defeat.

But the lack of an explosive of-
fense leaves Syracuse within
reach.

“If the defense comes through
and plays well,” said line coach
Howard Weyers, “we’ll be in the
game all the way.”

Syracuse presents a devasta-
ting offensive line that averages
230 pounds. Junior tackles Andy
Fusco (6-1. 244) and John Cher-
undolo (6-2, 248) lprovide most of
the running room for the ground
attack. -

But the backfield is still shaky.

 Three Coaches Face
Weekend Challenges

by Roy Jacobs
Sports Editor

This is a big weekend for more people than just Dave Hart
and the Panthers. It’s important for Leo Bemis and it’s es-
pecially important for Jim Banner.

For Hart, it’s another in a continuing series of key week-
end contests. Tomorrow at Syracuse he’s got a chance to si-
lence all his critics. The Panthers are heavy underdogs and
they’re definitely outprogrammed by Ben Schwartzwalder
and company; but an upset, or even a near-upset could re-
store a lot of faith in the Panther coaching staff as well as
improve team spirit.

"“"“"’”" K   The Panthers are promising a few surpris-

.3 es, and they’ll need them if they’re going to

; win. But the football story is basically the

 same as it has been during the past couple

 weeks. During that time, however, it has

V  overshadowed the two other fall sports. And

_, this is a big weekend for both of those, too.

_ The soccer season opened with nearly as

_ i   _  much optimism as the football season. A new

 JACOBS LI spirit, a new determination, we’ll be bet-

ter than last year,-we’ll score more, etc. Up until last week-
end, that sort of season hadn’t been been realized.

Then the booters matched a 3-0 win over Slippery Rock.
Not an overly tough opponent, but then, neither was William
and Mary. And the kickers also find themselves coming up
against a powerhouse tomorrow. A good "deal of their suc-
cess. this season depends on how well they can cope with
Temple. ' .

With shades of Dave Hart, soccer coach Leo Bemis has
insisted, “They can be beaten. There are some things we
can do that we’ll have to do.” He, too, is holding out that one
hope for an upset.

The soccer situation is strange. When the team lost its
first two games, there were grumblings about the coach.
Then they win their third game, and it seemed like nobody
even noticed. Maybe soccer is just destined to be a forgot-
ten sport.

One sport that no longer is forgotten, though, is cross coun-
try. Jim Banner has brought his team out of obscurity to
the point where several students have suggested (tongue-
in-cheek, that is) that Homecoming be held at a cross coun-
"try meet this season.

Strangely enough, Banner did the least pre—season rav-
ing about his team and still just smiles proudly while say--
ing little. But he, too, faces a major challenge this weekend
although there is little he himself can do about it.

Today the barriers compete in the Notre Dame Invitation-
al. They will get a good c h an e e to see how they stack up
against some of the top cross country squads in the country.

Yes, it’s a big weekend for the fall sports. All three teams
are involved in crucial competition. And, as might be expect-
ed, it’s all happening away from home. Except for a few die-
hard fans that will follow the Panthers to Syracuse, and even
fewer that will follow the kickers to Philadelphia, the best
anyone can do is stay at home and hope for the best.

This weekend might be a good time to re-evaluate the Uni-
versity’s athletic program, since there are no events — ex-
cept the _freshman soccer game — to watch. Sit back and
ask yourself a few questions about why certain teams per-
form the way they do and why certain other situations ex-
ist the way they are. You might come up with some interest-

. ing answers. .

Sixth Best Punter

‘Erratic’ Spicko Not Satisfied

O Kicking specialist Joe Spicko ranks sixth in the nation in
ing, but he won’t be satisfied until he’s number one.

“My goal is to be the best kicker in the country,” explained the soph-- 
omore from Greenville, Pa. “It’1l take a lot of work and it’s a big chal- g

lenge, but it’s notunreachable.

“I’m not satisfied with my kicking right now. I’ll only be satisfied 

when I’m on top and I’m shooting
for that.”

Spicko is averaging’ 42.9 yards '
per kick, only one yard behind the
nation’s leader, Benny Rhoads of
Cincinnati. His longest this year
has been a 64-yarder against West
Virginia, but last season as a
freshman he boomed a punt 85
yards from scrimmage against
Ohio State.

Although he’s one of the
nation’s leaders in punting, Spicko
explains that in high school he was
much better as a place kicker.
So far this year, his place kick-
ing has not been up to par and
he’s yet to kick a field goal.

SOPHOMORE JOE SPICKO ranks sixth in the nation in punting statis-
tics after the first three games this season, but he has yet to connect
on a field goal. Spicko set a state high school record two years ago with

a 53-yard three pointer.

“The only things you have in

“I was hungry,” explained

Bubba also seems hungry to

break the contest wide-open. The

his other upsets. '

“If William & Mary or‘Army

“My only'computer is this nick-

missed h_ave been long enough,

but they’ve been slightly off to the "

Spicko has been handling all_ 
the Panther kicking chores and

this may have something to do
with his inaccuracy on field
goals. “Each part of the kicking

game requires something differ-.
ent and for each part you--» _.
do something different,” he com- ~ 
mented. “You can get fouled up._- ' 

“I think I’ve just fallen into a 
rut in my place kicking. I’ve lost
 ‘the technique. It’s something psy-_ _ _
: chological. But I’m sure I’ll get.

back in the groove.”

A good kicking game can be
an asset in a battle of defenses‘; _ 

and tomorrow’s game with Syra-
cuse may turn into just that.

“Punting can help w i n a game

for scoring and by keeping the oth-
er team in the hole,” offered
Spicko.
“Syracuse looks
year. We’ll try to keep them deep
in their own territory and wait
for a break.” '
It will be Spicko’s job to keep
the Orangemen deep tomorrow.

And against a tough Syracuse de-

fense, the Panthers may have to
rely on Joe’s strong right foot
to get on the scoreboard.

“My kicking’s definitely going

Bill Livingston was the out-
standing batter for the winners.
He had two doubles and one triple
to spur the strong Pi Lam team
to victory. Phi Epsilon Phi must
play Pi Lambda Phi today for the
“A” division championship.

Because Phi Ep has lost
one game this season, while Pi
Lam has gone undefeated, Pi
Lam need win only one game to
clinch the title. Phi Ep must win
both games of the series to take
“A” division’s championship.

The champion team in “A”
division will now go on to play Pi
Kappa Alpha, the champions of
“B” division, for the league ti-
tle. The teams will play a series
of games, probably next‘ week,
to decide the league champion-
ship.

Although Pi Kappa Alpha looks
very strong in “B” division, Pi
Lambda Phi, last year’s cham-
pions and the only undefeated
team in either divisionthis year,
look like early favorites for the
title, provided they can get by
Phi Ep today.-

‘” Soccer Team Visits Temple,

  Could Battle Five Fullbacks

by ED CONLEY
Some strange things might
happen when the soccer team

takes the field against Tem-

ple, tomorrow.

Coach Leo Bemis is thinking
of using a new set-up, a 3-3-4. He
would move one of his linemen
into the halfback position in an
effort to upset the unusual for-
mation that Temple could come

. up with one using five fullbacks.

“We’ll have to see how it
looks,” the coach said, referring
to his new plans. “The three half-
backs should enable us to do

things that might work, even
against five fullbacks.’?
Explaining Temple’s use of,

the over-loaded back field, Bem-
is stated, “Basically, they have
a strong defensive team. They’re
emphasizing defense until their
line matures.

“They will give up a lot of mid-

' field, though,” he added.

This is part of the reason for
the extra man in Bemis’ half-
back force. He mentioned, “It

will get an offense started a bit
‘S-

sooner, especially if we can get
the ball out to our wings.

“If the ball comes out after a
shot, we’ll have the extra man
out there in the middle. He will
have a chance to move around
too,” Bemis continued, reason-
ing the possible switch._

But, the mentor isn’t sure the
formation will be necessary.
“They may not play five fullbacks
against us,” he mentioned.

“Temple was successful with
the set-up against Rider, but Ri-
der has a real tough offense,”
he continued.

The only other time Temple
played, they didn’t use the de-
fensive tactic. They lost that
game, 1-0 to Penn.

Whether they use it or not,
tomorrow, Bemis knows his squad
will be facing a team that will
be hard to beat.

He remarked, “Our goalie will
have no business being out (of
the goal area). They go a lot
for hitting long passes;'they’ll
shoot early, at about 25-30 yards.

“They can be beaten,” the

coach stated. “There are some
things we can do that we’ll have
to do. It’s just a matter of wheth-
er or not the personnel knows
what they’re doing.” .

Bemis doesn’t know exactly
what he’s going to have the boot-
ers do, but he does expect to work
centering the ball into his plans,
somehow.

“Centering worked well for
Rider against their defense;
they (Rider) should have had
more goals,” he reasoned.

The success the kickers had in
getting the ball to the interior line-
men paid off in victory last week
against Slippery Rock, a win that
helped some of the players be-
lieve in the team, again.

“But, we won’t be over-con-
fident,” Bemis commented.
“Some of the guys might think
that We’re out of our league play-
ing Temple. We’re not. We weren’t
ing Temple. We’re not. We
weren’t when we played West

Chester, either.”

He concluded, “We’re not out
of our league with anybody’?

Play Johnstown

Frosh Booters at Home

by MARTIN HELLMAN - ’- If;

Pitt’s branch campus of Johnstown provides the second op- 
ponent of the year for the freshman soccer team. The booters
will“try for their first victory tomorrow at Kennard Field atifj

11:00A.M.*

Last week, the kickers lost a hard fought contest to Slippery Rock,
. 3-2. Although the overall play of the frosh was good, coach Pete Sny-
der recognized several faults committed by the inexperienced team....s~_._i

Hegstated that the major prob-
lem ‘on offense was the lack of
passing to the wingman. “We kept
getting bogged down attempting
to move the ball up the middle.”

Much of this week’s practice

_has been devoted to correcting

this mistake.‘ The forwards and
wingmen drilled on passing the
ball from the wings into the goal
area. Hopefully, the booters will
be able to move the ball quicker
and more accurately than they
did against Slippery Rock.

The booters’ defense was strong

The booters’ defense was
strong even though it allowed
three goals. Snyder remarked,

‘‘All three goals were fluke plays '

and were not the fault of the de-
fense.” ‘

However, Snyder was not en-
tirely happy with the fullbacks’
pursuit of the opponent’s line-

tomorrow. I

Chez, assistant professor in the
University School of Medicine,
will moderate the panel.

Plans for this discussion center
on the emotional factors and re-
sponsibilities in pre-marital sex-
relations. the virgin and the non-
virgin (both male and female).
the psychological factors involved
in contraception impotence and
frigidity.

The third panel. to be held at 2
p.m. Saturday. will be moder-
ated by Dr. Douglass Thompson.
director of the University Student
Health Service. Dr. Golden and
Dr. Chez 'a:e the scheduled pan-
elists.

The focus of this panel will be
on the similarities and differences
in the biological and psychologi-
cal sexual responses of males and
females, non-coital and coital sex,
and contraception.

The forum hopes to create open

tion. One of the basic guidelines
set by the committee has been to
invite speakers representing dif-
ferent viewpoints so that no one
system of values or attitudes is
expounded.

es. These are provided for ques-
tions pertinent to a meaningful
understanding. of sex and sexual-
