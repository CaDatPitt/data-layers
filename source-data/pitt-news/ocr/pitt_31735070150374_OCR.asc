Rob Behling stood in the net, eye-
ing an oncoming three—man rush.
As a junior goaltender of1Pitt’s
Division I men’s-club hockey team,
it was something Behling had faced
many times before. This time, how-
ever, was a bit different. Sidney
Crosby, Pascal Dupuis and Ben
Lovejoy of the Pittsburgh Penguins
were skating at full speed straight
toward him. i »
Dupuis glided down the left
side, took a pass and then hit Cros-
by on the right to put it in the goal.
“It’s an unbelievable pace. You
can mentally prepare for it, but
you don’t know what it’s going to
be like until you’re actually doing
it,” Behling said.
Add this to the list of incred-
ible team bonding experiences
that take place each season for

? members of the club. And don’t

be deceived by the word “club.”
The highly competitive team is
a member of the American Col-
legiate Hockey Association and
College Hockey Mid-America divi-
sion. As of last week, the team is
ranked No. 24 in the ACHA, with
conference play having begun two
weeks ago. Its record is 5-4 overall
and 3-0 in CHMA play.

Along with Behling, nine oth— '

er Panther upperclassmen took
part in the unique opportunity
to practice and scrimmage at a
Southpointe, Pa., rink with seven
Penguins players, who are cur-
rently locked out of NHL compe-
tition amidst labor negotiations.

Keely McCaskie stood on a chair
and told the people in the crowd to
close their eyes and imagine what it
would be like to live in aworld where
people were respected everywhere
they went, with no fear of violence.

“Doesn’t that feel good?” asked
McCaskie, vice president of the
Campus Women’s Organization.
“That’s what we’re going to get to-
night.”

About 60 people met in the Wil-
liam Pitt Union ballroom Wednes-
day night to collect posters and
learn chants before taking to the
streets of South Oakland. Their mis-
sion was to raise awareness about

sexual violence as part of Take Back,

internationally.

a voice to something that doesn’t
get reported,” CWO President Bella
Salamone said.

Last week, students gathered to
make the signs and posters that they
would carry at Wednesday’s event.
Organizations like the Black Action
Society and Rainbow Alliance took
part in the event, and students made
posters with phrases such as “No

_more silence. No more violence,”

and “My body isn’t yours.”

“It is important to people in all
different communities,” said senior
Ta Misha Bascombe, president of
the Black Action Society.

Bascombe said that all campus
organizations should show support
for raising awareness about issues
like sexual violence, no matter
what their goals as a group entail.
It was her ﬁrst time taking part in
the event. '

“In the black community, we

happens to them.”

Salamone and McCaskie led
the march with a megaphone and
catchy chants while the students
following ﬁlled the sidewalks as they
marched down Forbes Avenue. As

they moved into South Oakland yell— '

STUDENT GOVERNMENT

SGB campaigning begins, current Board members run for president  

Megan Trimble
Staff Wrz'ter

A couple of familiar faces will begin to cam-
paign around campus for the position of
Student Government Board President today.
Natalie Rothenberger and Gordon Loud-
erback, current Board members, will run for
the SGB presidency in the annual November
election that will decide all nine members of
the undergraduate student governing body.

Sixteen students, including current Allo— ’

cations Committee Chairman Michael Nites
and current Community Outreach Chair-
woman Mary Mallampalli, are running for
Board member seats and span six slates. One
candidate, Lauren Barney, will be running
independently. L

Barney said that she chose to run indepen-
dently because, after interning with Board
member Zoe Samudzi, she knew that she was
interested in running and knew that she could
accomplish her goals on her own.

“I didn’t want to go through all of the
politics,” Barney said. “I wanted to get my
initiatives through and follow the SGB rules
to make it happen, but I did not ﬁnd it neces-
sary to bring more people into it. I know that
I can accomplish things myself, and I have
great support from friends and family. So I’m
really excited to get started.”

As part of the current campaigning period,
candidates can solicit and receive endorse-
ments, raise funds, hang banners, advertise

electronically, distribute campaign items —‘

excluding those only to be distributed during
paper campaigning — and place ads in The
Pitt News. During this time, all of the actions
of each individual candidate are considered
a part of his or her campaign.

This phase of the process is different from
paper campaigning, which starts the week
before the Nov. 15 election on Monday, Nov.
12. Under paper campaigning guidelines, can-
didates will be allowed to distribute posters,

‘ﬂyers, buttons and stickers. Chalking by can-V

didates or any authorized endorsing organi-
zation is also permitted during this phase.

Louderback said that he has been looking
forward to sharing his ideas with students on
campus, distributing campaign T-shirts to
his friends and oflicially accepting endorse-
ments.

Louderback said that he chose to run with
Amelia Brause and C] Bonge on the Forbes
slate because the Board candidates “mean
well” and are dedicated to the University. He
said that he trusts in both of his slate partners
and knows they have high aspirations for the
future of SGB.

The Forbes slate has ofﬁcially endorsed
the Fifth slate, and Louderback said that he

Before the group left to march, Salamone
went over statistics about sexual violence at
Pitt and stated that every week, one woman
reports that she has been sexually assaulted
on campus. The statistic inspired the chant,
“One girl a week at Pitt? We won’t stand for it.”

  Trade embargo against Cuba a relic

C of a very different political

Rosie McKinley‘
Columnist

Cuban buses overflow with peo-
ple. As a result of the country’s
transportation crisis, riding a
crowded bus in Havana is a bit
like spooning with a bunch of
strangers. But with reggaeton
blasting through the speakers,
the ride remains comfortable
despite the Caribbean’s sweaty
heat. After 50 years of austere
socialism, Cubans gracefully
manage the challenges brought
by economic struggle, even if it
means people’s hands stuck in’
others’ armpits.

While many of Cuba’s eco-
nomic pains are self—inﬂicted,
the Cuban people suffer further
because of the United States’
draconian economic embargo.
against the country. This embar-
go is an outdated policy of dubi-
ous effectiveness that damages
the U.S.’s reputation abroad. We
should rid ourselves of it. '

You should also take this is-
sue into consideration when you
vote. Despite the fact that Cuba

_has been largely overlooked
this election, it is one area of ,

foreign policy that President
Barack Obama and presidential
nominee Mitt Romney actually
disagree on. If you’re failing to
see much difference between
the two on issues elsewhere, a
Romney presidency would usher
in entirely different policies in
Cuba than those being pursued
today. _ A

The embargo began largely
because of the Cuban Missile
Crisis, which reached its cli-
max 50 years ago this week.
The news that the Soviet Union
was stockpiling nuclear weap-
ons just 90 miles from the U.S.
coast sparked the most volatile
moments of the Cold War. Our
parents found themselves hid-
ing under school desks, fearing
Armageddon; embargo seemed
appropriate.

A half—century later, those
school children are now mid-
dle—aged baby boomers nearing
retirement. We, as a generation,
are inheriting a much different
America. The embargo is a rel-

climate

ic; a festering wound‘ of failed
foreign policy that we have the
responsibility to end in order to

-repair relations with our south-

ern neighbor.

For one, the embargo hasn’t
worked. It has failed in its goals
of ‘removing the Castro family
from power and restoring ‘de-
mocracy in Cuba. It has only cre-
ated a humanitarian crisis that
we are partly responsible for.

Cuba remainsa socialist country ‘

with Castro leadership, and we
are left wondering why a policy
that doesn’t work remains, es-
pecially considering the inter-
national disapproval it brings
.— the U.N. General Assembly
has-condemned the embargo for
20 straight years.

The Electoral College is partly
to blame. The vast majority of

Cuban-Americans live in Florida -

and New Jersey —— two major
electoral states in the presiden-
tial election, with Florida pp/er-T
petually competitive. These are
the people who lost property and

wealth as a result of Castro’s revolution.
To them, a harsh embargo is the only
appropriate form of justice for Castro.
Obama, in a risky political move, has
slowly been rolling away many of these
programs, risking Cuban-American votes
by loosening travel laws to Cuba. Working
under the belief that we can’t improve
relations with a country that we don’t
understand, he has lifted many travel re-
strictions, allowing individuals to attain
permission to visit. His policies allowed
the Pitt in Cuba study abroad program to
restart in 2010 after Bush-era restrictions
forced the program’s termination.
Romney endorses a much different

path forward, promising a return to the
strict adherence of the Helms-Burton Act,
which would strengthen the embargo to a
point so anti-humanitarian that American

allies from Great Britain to Argentina‘
\ have condemned it. The act, signed by

President Bill Clinton, bans trade with
any trading partner of Cuba, even for
medicine or food.

In the 1990s, while American chil-
dren were growing up in relatively pros-
perous times, this act left Cuban kids
to starve. There are stories of people

.melting condoms —— which the Cuban

government issued to keep population
growth manageable —’— into cheap pizzas
as a wayof stretching their food sources.
Although these stories are probably ur-
ban myths, their existence points to the

‘ awful circumstances that most Cubans

lived in. Conditions were so awful that
thousands of Cubans risked their lives
to ﬂoat through shark—infested waters
on man-made rafts to reach the shores
of southern Florida.

In America, they found increased
freedoms. This is the great irony of the
embargo: While we were banning invest-
ment in Cuba in the name of freedom, our
government’s restrictions on travel were
in a similar although lesser way prevent-
ing us from exercising our own. Also,
while we attack the Castro government
for limiting elections, many of us bliss-
fully ignore the right we have here: Where
is the embargo on the 45 percent of the
country‘ that doesn’t go to the polls just
because we don’t feel like it?

Obama’s policy toward Cuba is far from
ideal: Some form of embargo will be con-
tinued under a second term. Yet Romney’s
proposed return to harsh repression does
nothing to advance our countries toward
a working relationship. Under Romney,
we face the continued diminishing of
our country’s international reputation.
We become further distanced from our
once-rumored greatness as a leader of
the free world.

That said, if you strongly agree with '

returning to the harsh status quo that has
done little to influence Cuban policies
over the last 50 years, then vote against
‘ Obama. After all, voting either way is
valuable. ’
Just ask a Cuban who can’t. I

in university admissions policies is that
a broader criterion can serve the same
purpose.

If universities focus on disadvantage
rather than race, they will not only con-
tinue to be racially diverse, but will also
avoid advantaging members of minority
groups who don’t come from backgrounds
of disadvantage. ‘

Factors like socioeconomic status,
neighborhood poverty levels and family
circumstances are much better indica-
tions of those who actually experience
disadvantage. .

Of course, institutional racism lives
on. The National Center for Education
Statistics data show that the achievement
gap between white, black and Hispanic
students persists. ‘ A

In 2008, there were 846,000 black
men in U.S. prisons. According to Michelle

V Alexander, an "author and Ohio State law

professor, “More African—American men
are in prison orjail, on probation or pa-
role than were enslaved in 1850, before
the Civil War began.”

But it is not fair to say that all minori-
ties necessarily come from backgrounds
of disadvantage and should therefore
receive preference in university admis-

chicftbr 3.50 each.

really need it. .

I sat down with Larry Davis, the dean
of Pitt’s School of Social Work and the
director of the Center on Race and Social
Problems. Ivasked him if disadvantage
might be a more useful factor than race.
While he acknowledged that affirmative
action policies could relyon disadvantage
instead of race, Davis warned that schools
might ignore the importance of racial
diversity by focusing on disadvantage-

“Ideally, we want society to not be
race—blind, butlbe race-neutral,” Davis
told me. “You’re not going to correct what
was once a racial problem by being ra-
cially blind.”

Some will dispute that by making prog-
ress against racism, we will necessar-
ily devalue racial diversity. This is a fair
enough criticism, but unless institutional
racism disappears in America, racial di-
versity at universities will be reflected
by favorably considering candidates who
come from disadvantaged backgrounds.

Introspective rap takes on honest autobiography

Compton—born Kendrick Lamar raps in his
breakout mixtape from last year, 5ec1z'on.80,
“This the music that saved my life / Y’all be
callin’ it hip—hop, I be callin it hypnotize.”
In a way, this was a declaration of what was
to come: Sixty minutes of technically gifted
and topically poignant hip—hop that would
set the stage for a new standard of lyricism.

his major—label debut, good kid, m/1/1.11 rig»,
Lamar ﬁnds himself in a peculiar position.

Faced with cosmic expectations, having to _

push back the release date and a premature
leak on the Internet, the 25—year—old emcee
resorted back to the medium he so cherishes.

Three days before the official release
date, Lamar posted the track “The Heart
Pt. 3,” the third installment to a series of
tracks dating back to the rapper’s 2010 Opera
Dedicated mixtape, for free on the Internet.

He begins with the verse, “When the
whole world see you as Pac reincarnated /
That’s enough pressure to live your whole life
sedated / Find the tallest building in Vegas
and jump off it / But I could never rewrite
history in a coﬂin.”

“Fun size”

Directed by: Josh Schwartz
Starring: Victoria Justice, Jackson
Nicoll, Chelsea Handler

Grade: C-

A Nickelodeon ﬁlm starring Victoriajustice
and Chelsea Handler has fewer high hopes
for it than the miniscule amount of Hal-
loween candy distributed on trick—or—treat
night. But “Fun Size” is a revelation into just

Film less ‘Fun’ than stale Halloween cad

“Fun Size” lacks humor with an inconsistent plot and less,-than-amusing script. MCT Campus ,

how horribly wrong a ﬁlm can go.

The Josh Schwartz—dir'ected ﬁlm of-
fers audiences no redeemable moments
because of its outrageous plot and incon-
sistent script. Containing predictable plot
elements scattered with ridiculous turns of
events, the holiday—themed movie isn’t even
amusing enough to call “fun.”

The premise of “Fun Size” revolves
around a high school Halloween party -
need I say more? —- and the main character,
Wren (Victoria Justice), who wants to at-
tend the party because its host is local high
school heartthrob Aaron Riley (Thomas
McDonell).

But the day before the event, her newly
widowed mother Joy (Chelsea Handler)
drops the bomb that she will be going to a

Halloween party herself, with her 20-some-
thing—year—old boyfriend Keevin (Josh
Pence). This leaves Wren with no choice
but to take her little brother Albert (Jackson
Nicoll) trick—or—treating instead of going
to the party.

But chaos ensues when Wren loses Al-
bert in a haunted house and is forced to
drive around with two nerds. One of them
is Roosevelt (Thomas Mann), who has a
crush on Wren. With such a stereotypical
plot line —— it’s like a Halloween version of
“Nick and Norah’s Inﬁnite Playlist” —— it
seems the script writers felt the need to
distinguish their ﬁlm by throwing an array
of odd and, quite frankly, “WTF” moments

  In-session
  Interviews

illuminative  

Emily Horstman
I/VPTS Contributor

There is a difference between listening to
a piece of music and really appreciating it.
Sometimes we feel like putting music on
in the background, but at other moments
we crave a connection with the meaning of
a work. Unfortunately, there aren’t book-
club—esque discussion groups for all of your
favorite songs. That, however, is where the
in—studio session comes in.‘

When it comes to novels and other cre-
ative works, we emphasize the importance of

I their authorial and temporal contexts. Music

is often just as autobiographical, though the
inﬂuence of context can easily get buried in
a song’s aesthetics. An interview paired with
a stripped—down recording of an already be-
loved song provides insight into the artist’s
mindset and intentions, allowing listeners
to relate to a work on a deeper level.

Driving back to Oakland from the forest-
ed hills of Hazelwood on a Sunday evening,
I heard an in—studio session with Michael
Angelakos of Passion Pit on the radio. He
played “Sleepyhead” — a poppy and ethereal
tune sampling Mary O’Hara’s Version of the
Irish folk song “Oro Mo Bhaidin.” The origi-
nal version of the song has been over—played
since 2010, but this piano—only rendition
ﬁt the mood of that Sunday night perfectly.

When Angelakos ﬁnished performing,
he talked about his music, writing process
and why he has cancelled so many tour dates
recently.

‘Angelakos has struggled with‘ manic
depression for years and decided to take
some time off from his most recent tour
on doctor’s orders. The radio interviewer
pointed out the interesting dichotomy be-
tween the upbeat backdrop and the dark
place from which Angelakos writes. In spite
of everything, the frontrnan calls Passion
Pit’s latest album, Gossamer, a triumph.
After all, Angelakos said, “I’m alive, and I
ﬁnished the record.” I

This was all on the Oct. 12 editionof
Sound Opinions, a program recorded at
WBEZ Chicago and aired on Pittsburgh’s
local NPR station, 90.5 WESA. In—studios
like this provide the autobiographical con-
text of songs that is generally unavailable
to the everyday listener. _

into the mix.

One of these moments includes Roosevelt
introducing Wren to his moms, who then
proceed to speak ancient Greek to him as
they weave a portrait of President Barack
Obama. This point, along with others in the
ﬁlm, makes no cohesive sense in the ﬁ1m’s
context and seems more like a random inclu-
sion than anything.

Another weird moment occurs when Al-
bert meets a pedophile-esque cashier at a
convenience store who then cajoles him into
his plot to seek revenge on an ex—girlfriend
by covering her apartment in toilet paper.

The rest of the ﬁlm includes Albert danc-
ing in a club with scantily clad women, a
mechanical chicken humping a car and R00-
sevelt’s friend Peng (Osric Chau) — dressed
up as Aaron Burr, the man who killed Alexan-
der Hamilton —— shooting a chicken thigh out
of a bully’s hand. Yes, folks, it was that bad.

Because of these random moments, the
plot has no symmetry, and the rest of the
movie follows suit. There are no redeeming
moments that turn the ﬁlm around, and the
ﬁnal product will leave audience members
shocked and unimpressed.

Needless to say, while you might think
that a movie titled “Fun Size” would be the
perfect ﬁlm to get you into the Halloween
spirit because of its theme, it is more likely
to make you wantto gag on your candy corn.

And that’s no fun.‘I L  '

ALBUM

anything but introspection. The honesty of
his music originates from his development
of a storyline in all of his tracks — a story-
line that, if followed, paints an even larger
picture of the artist’s life.

It makes sense, then, that the tagline to
722./l./1.d rig): is “A short ﬁlm by Kendrick
Lamar.” On this record more than any other,
Lamar guides his audience through an expe-
rience — his own. The album starts with a
recording of teens —— presumably including
the rapper —— praying to Christ. And in the
same way that “Pulp Fiction” introduces the
ﬁlm’s ending at its beginning, this ominous
introduction demands immediate attention
from the listener. As a director, Lamar has
his audience hooked.

The story he tells is special but not un-
usual. While “trap music” stars such as Chief
Keef and Gucci Mane tell similar tales from
America’s roughest neighborhoods, there
exists a certain fantasy to them. Listeners
don’t feel the hunger and pain over these
artists’ pasts, for one, because such nations
are unattractive and less glamorous.

Lamar’s story walks that ﬁne line as well.
As a narrator, he’s the good kid in the mad
city: He hovers above Compton, Calif., with
a perspective that is informed by intellect
but reigned in by experience. He avoids the
didactic pitfalls that turn listeners away from
post—Fooa’ 2’? liquor Lupe Fiasco, instead
relenting at moments to the ills he decries.

On the Beach House—sampling “Money
Trees,” we ﬁnd Lamar explaining, not jus-
tifying, a mentality pervasive in his home-
town. “Might even shoot a reverend for the
revenue,” he raps just as the chorus comes
in. He carefully walks listeners through a
typical ride through the city, and the song
hits home with complete honesty in lines
such as “back to -reality, we poor ya b*sh.”
He makes it impossible to not at the very
least appreciate the struggle of the narrator.

“Swimming Pools (Drank)” must al-
ready be on the playlist for any number of
debauchery—ﬁlled keggers, and Lamar is OK
with it -— he might even be at one.

This is the appeal of his perspective: He
respects the intelligence of his listeners who
understand the destructive results of drink-
ing too much but still do it. Lamar guides us
through his experience under the inﬂuence.
At one point in the track, his conscience
comes in, telling him not to drink any more
— a sentiment familiar to of~age listeners
for sure.lIn the album version, the song ends
with Lamar vomiting and regretting his deci-
sions, yet understanding why he made them.

This is perhaps his greatest strength and
the reasonwhy he truly feels he can rewrite
history. Songs like the Janet Jackson-inﬂu-
enced “Poeticjustice” or the bass—thumping
“Backseat Freestyle” all have a place on top-
40 radio. For plenty of rappers, this could
be seen as a jab, but Lamar’s message isn’t
subverted by its accessibility. Instead, he

_ manages to bolster his complex perspective

with the fact that he can speak to everyone. I

catchy hook and euphoric danceability.
But the alternative version of the song that
Angelakos plays live on the piano consumes
listeners with its heartbreaking melody
and tragic — though semantically unintel-
ligible — lyrics. Pair that with Angelakos’
discussion about his inner struggle, and
suddenly your favorite dance tune becomes
an inspirational anthem for every time you

‘ feel the winter blues approaching.

As avid concert connoisseurs already
know, listening to a song performed live is
a much more active and formative experi-
ence than listening to a recording. A song
becomes entirely different when everything
is stripped down: the lyrics become more
prominent, as does the raw emotion and
personality of the artist. And, of course,
having a,visu_a;l,,com_ponent helps as well.

The Pitt women’s soccer team be-
gan and ended its 2012 campaign
with a roar, but it often found
itself whimpering everywhere in
between. Coming off a disastrous
two-win 2011 season and an off-
season coaching change that saw

Greg Miller take the helm, Pitt’s _

expectations were mixed, ac-
cording to junior Katie Lippert.

“After last year, which wasn’t
great, and with a new coaching
staff and new girls coming in,
we knew not to set our hopes too
high and be realistic,” she said.
“We sat down as a team and de-
cided on a record to shoot for.
While the record we set may have
been a little out of reach, it was a
good sign that everyone wanted
to set the bar high. But all in all,
the season probably went how
I expected it to. We improved a
lot from last year, and we need
to keep on building and focusing
on what we did right.”

Senior Ashley Cuba disagreed.

“I honestly expected a lot
more this year,” she said. “This
team was very capable of mak-
ing the Big East tournament, and
it was extremely disappointing

 SPORTS

Season of improvement for Pitt, but also mixed results

when we didn’t.”

The Panthers began the sea-
son with nonconference victo-
ries over Eastern Michigan, Rob-
ert Morris, St. Bonaventure and
Duquesne. Combine that with a
tough 1-0 loss to Michigan, and
the nonconference part of the
season provided a stark contrast
to last year. This year’s team av-
eraged 1.8 goals per game and,

more importantly, only gave up .

an average of 1 goal per game,
down from 2.4 goals lastseason.
Even after the West Virginia
90 Minute Classic, where Pitt
would lose 1-0 in overtime to
Miami and to Penn State, hopes
were high. The team played
well in both games, and several
missed chances kept the Penn
State game from becoming close.
But when redshirt sophomore
goalkeeper Nicole D’Agostino
registered Pitt’s first shutout of
the year, recording two saves in
a 1-0 victory over Liberty, her
success marked the last Panther
victory for more than a month.
“Nicole was our backbone,”
Cuba said. “She saved us so
many times "when we weren’t
playing well and kept us in the
game. Even though the rest of
the team wasn’t producing, she

never complained like she very
easily could have.” V
Pitt’s last season in the Big
East went poorly. Unable to es-
tablish any sense of offensive
rhythm and thus placing a tre-
mendous amount of pressure on

the defense, Pitt dropped seven
of its next nine games. The team
was only able to salvage 0-0 and

. 2-2 ties to South Florida and St.
John’s, respectively, while being
outscored 26-5 over the span of
those nine games.

Focus and frustration were
the buzzwords several players

Danielle Benner — used when
asked what defined the team’s

Behling’s connection with a Pen-
guins equipment manager landed
him and his teammates the oppor-
tunity to skate with the pros, who
are eager for competition and a
goalie to shoot on while their off-
season lingers. Behling ﬁlled in
as a netminder for the "team last
Thursday, and afterward some of
the Penguins players suggested he
bring along a few of his Pitt team-
mates for a scrimmage.

“It was kind of a joke at ﬁrst, but
then we got serious, and Friday we
sort of ﬁnalized it,” Behling said.

Joining him for the Monday
morning skate were defenseman
Scott Litwack and forward Anthony
Matrisciano, both seniors and New
Jersey natives. The two could not be
happier with their decision to play
hockey at Pitt.

 

For Litwack and many others on
the team, the hockey culture and
lifestyle has become a Way of life.

“It’s something we’ve been doing
our entire lives. I started skating

old andbeen doing it for over 15
years. It’s become part of what we
do I guess,” Litwack said.

“Even outside the rink we all
hang out together. I spend all my
free time with players on the team,”
Matrisciano said.

General Manager Andy Mecs, a
Pitt graduate and four-year player
on the hockey club, said the team
has come a long way since his play-
ing days from 1996 to 2000, but the
traditions remain true.

“It’s been hard to walk away
from because it’s such a great group
of guys every year, and you want
them to have a good experience,”
he said. '

mid—season conference slide.

- “Our slide came in the middle of the
season, when it is harder to stay focused
on the little details,” she said. “Plus, with
school and the various injuries that inevi-
tably crop up, it made it really difﬁcult to
stay focused. And once we started losing,
it became very hard to pull ourselves up.”

“I think it was frustration,” Lippert
said. “We were in every game, but we just
couldn’t pull through, and we kept press-
ing harder and harder instead of focusing
on just playing and having fun. We kept

Oct. 7, the Panthers were mathematically
eliminated from qualifying for the Big East
tournament. But with their minds freed
from the burden of the playoffs, the Pan-
thers performed much better in their last
two games, winning against Connecticut

» and Providence.

While the Panthers were disappointed
that they missed out on competing in the
postseason, the victorious homestand

‘during the ﬁnal weekend of the season

provided a bright spot for the team.

I “The high point was the end of the -

season,” Benner said. “We were already
eliminated, but we were able to end the
season with two solid home wins on Se-
nior_Weekend, and our play was signiﬁ-

— cantly better than

and once we got into a funk, we couldn’t

The lowlights of Pitt’s winless confer-
ence streak included a 5-1 loss to Mar-
quette, a 4-0 loss to DePaul and a listless

8-0 performance at home against George-

town, when Hoyas sophomore Daphne

. Corboz scored ﬁve goals — a total that

would have tied her for the most goals on
Pitt’s team all season.

“The low point, if I had to pick one, A
' was deﬁnitely the Georgetown game,”

Lippert said. “That was our rock bottom.
We really needed that win, and we just got
so discouraged when they scored right at
the beginning that we fell apart.”

‘ Following their tie with St. John’s on

the team with 14
points —— three

goals and a team—high eight assists, good ‘
for a second-place tie in the Big East. She 7

was followed by redshirt sophomore Alex
Charlebois with 12 points — a team—high

' ﬁve goalsand two assists. Cuba registered

two goals and one assist on the year,- ex-
tending her Pitt school record number of
goals that she set last season from 21 to 23
and breaking the school‘ record for points
with 51. In goal, D’Agostino started all 19
games, registering a 1.70 goals-against
average and a .731 save percentage. Her 87
saves were good for second in the Big East.

7 Next season, the Panthers will leave
the Big East after 17 seasons and compete
for the first time in the Atlantic Coast
Conference — widely considered the best
conference for women’s college socceni

HOCKEY

While the players themselves realize the

,,beneﬁts of playing hockey, the reality remains

that they’re not very well-known throughout
campus. ~

“The thing I don’t like is that we’re con-
sidered on the same level as something along
the lines of an intramural sport. We have
nationals. There’s rankings every week,”

“Matrisciano said.

Litwack agreed, adding, “It’s deﬁnitely a
point of frustration. We do put a lot of time
and effort into it, and We’re not recognized
maybe as much as we’d like. We’re no slouch-
es,” he said.

   

 

Despite the lack of recognition, it’s evident
these players care too much about the game
and one another to give it up.

“We’re not playing it for the fanfare. We’re
playing because we love the game and we have
fun doing it,” Behling said.

It’s easy to forget about a team that plays
all of its home games about 30 minutes from
campus in Harmarville, Pa. But because of
tight budget constraints and the expensive
cost of ice time, the team doesn’t have much of
a choice. It practices twice a week for an hour
and a half each night, starting around 10 p.m.
because ice time is cheaper later in the day.

Matrisciano claims the late start isn’t so ~

bad as long as you don’t have an 8 a.m. class
the next day.
The travel, whether it’s carpooling to Har—

after parents ha

marville or riding abus to an away game, also
serves as bonding time for the team.

Behling, a junior and Mt. Lebanon, Pa.,
native, transferred from the University of
Connecticut, where he played hockey for the
Huskies. Although he came to Pitt primarily
for academics, he has also found his niche
within Pitt’s hockey club.

“For a club sport, we do spend a lot of time
together. Driving all the way to Harmarville,
practicing, four—hourbus rides —- It’s great.
It’s not a typical club sport,” he said.

Last week the team traveled to Ohio to take
on conference foe Ohio University.

“We’re talking about a three-hour bus ride
to OU, then staying at a hotel. And because of
our budget constraints, it’s not a comfortable

stay in a hotel,” Behling said jokingly. “But '

or BUILDING BETTER uvss

again, that’s kind of the bonding and team
experience that we talk about.” '

Head coach Stu Rulnick, entering his sec
0nd year at the helm for the Panthers, also
believes in the team experience andbases part
of his coaching philosophy on this principle.
Rulnick, former head coach of 10 years for
Plum High School, said the open—door policy
he has established is good for him as well as
his players. —

“It helps not only with problems inside
hockey, but problems outside hockey as well.
It helps them and gives them conﬁdence in
the person they’re playing for,” Rulnick said.

“[Rulnick] is deﬁnitely one of the most
approachable coaches I’ve ever played for,”
Matrisciano said.

While the players also said there was an
inevitable adjustment period in getting used
to a new coach, last year’s season, the ﬁrst
with Rulnick at the helm, ended with 22 wins
and a spot in the conference championship.

Litwack noted, “You see it in.the results.”

The 20—win season was the ﬁrst for this
year’s senior class and is something they look
to build upon this year. i

“For our senior class, the. ﬁrst few years
were kind of rough. We were around .500.
We had high expectations and underachieved
a little bit maybe. Coming into last year, we
were more leaders. That was our big leap.
We almost won our league championship,”
Litwack said.

The winning season ended with a heart-
breaking 1-0 loss to division rival West Vir-
ginia. Behling, playing his ﬁrst season for
Pitt last year, earned himself the starter role
and played in 27 games, including the con-
ference ﬁnal. Despite his impressive season
statistics, Behling admits, “I wish I. could’ve
had that one goal back,” referring to the West
Virginia game. “It hit me right in the hand
and dropped in.”

While the Pitt football and basketball
teams now search for a new rival after West
Virginia’s departure from the Big East, the
hockey rivalry remains strong between the
two. They’ll renew the rivalry Nov. 3 in Har-
marville at 4:50 p.m. ‘

‘.‘Certainly, West Virginia is our biggest ri-
val because they’re in our conference. They’re
really the main team we compete with to go
to nationals. Especially this year, we have that
expectation we can get to nationals because
we were just so close last year,” Behling said.

Despite losing their all—time leading points
scorer, Robby McDyre, and two othertop
scorers to graduation, the Panthers have high
expectations entering this year. ‘

Newcomers Cole Snyder and Nick Blaney
are expected to replace some of the scoring
the team has lost from last year. Likewise,
sophomore forward Brian Stein has his up-
perclassmen teammates sensing big things
to come. _

“There’s some freshmen last year that are
now stepping up into new roles, and they’re
doing really well in themso far,” Litwack said.

As someone who has seen a number of
teams come through Pitt’s hockey program,
Mecs is also optimistic looking forward.

“I see how hockey and the program has
progressed. I think the sky’s the limit,” he
said. I . c
