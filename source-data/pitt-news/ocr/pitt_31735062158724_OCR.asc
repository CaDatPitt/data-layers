Socratic Irony
Finds New York’s
‘Dead ‘End’

enacted last week a signiﬁcant

‘ prose fiction trend in critical real-

aﬁrst meeting of the school year

_ Catl1edr»al._- - ‘

' BY MILTON G.'LEHMAN
Cast from the mold of New
York ’s East Side slums into the
role of “Spit” in Sidney Kings-
ley’s socially eri’r.ical “Dead
End,” Edward Furman re-

part of the drama in which he
minored for seven months.

Kin'gley’s opus, staged and lo-
cated on one of New York’s slum
section streets cut short by the
East river, synthesized the social
problems emanating from practic-
al -and philosophical dead end
streets.‘ For the cast, the director
selected characters born in the
conditions highlighted : by. the
drama, gave the drama the further
highlight of actuality.

seazure... C 

 born and raised in the‘ 3

setting ‘of the -play,» had been lifted’
to the vs"ta'ge>for1the sake of real-
ism. As “Spit,” one of the “tough
kids,” he won critics’ praise for
handling a part that could not
have! been acting.

. Last week he was picked up for
“disorderly conduct;” speciﬁcally,
for annoying Millicent Green,
blonde riverside. ‘.‘Francey”- of the
play. The police found him at the
dead end of one of the East Side
streets somewhere in the 50’s took
him to the Belleview Hospital for
observation, prior to the presen-
tation of charges by his actor-co-
hort Francey.

Those Who Shudder . . .

An ironical sort of proof has
been offered to the skeptical.
There were those who shuddered
vigorously during the course of
the dream, conceded that possi-
bly Mr. Kingley had cause for
complaint. Many of these were
among the faithful clan of thea-
ter-goers who saw “Children’s
Hour” and shuddered, who saw
Caldwell’s orgy of backwoods
Kentusky and shuddered.

Shudders have been distributed
widely from the contemporary le-
gitimate stage, following after the

ism. Ostensibly, it is the Socratic
gadﬂy, asking, repeatedly asking,
what is to be done?

Thus we, the theater-goer and
the columnist, the politician and
the political scientist, shudder in
our particular styles. Furman,
too, is with us at the dead end.
And’ the East river, ' as re-
produced in the Nixon’s orchestra
pit, "grows stagnant.

‘Student Index’

Coming out’ this Friday with a
Campus -Index of students,’ ‘Octo-

ing the faculty an opportunity to
-“come back” on the students, ac-
cording to Tom Smith, C39, editor
of the magazine. — - « -

“In order to compile this biased
opinion~ of students,” revealed
Smith, “we had to contact all pro-
fessors ‘of the University to tele-
graph. : But,‘ because . some of
them replied with ‘Collect’ tele-
grams, we were unable to con-
sider many opinions.”

“For the beneﬁt of students, we
are instituting a -new feature call-
-ed the ‘Mailbox,’ where a" few of
the many letters received by the
staff will be answered,” added
Smith. ‘

Unless too much pressure is
"brought to bear on "The Panther,

asserman Tests

  NE‘ l?l{ASE of one of the greatest educa-
‘, " ‘t‘ionzi,l‘prcgrams going‘ on in America, the
nation-wide attempt to control and reduce the
number bf cases of syphilis, gets ziisinduction
on campus beginning today with the program
of free .Wa.sserman tests by the lV.len’s and
'Women’s‘ S-‘w.-dent Health Services.

Through the C"30p€l“a.llO1l of Dr. I-I. Clifford
Carlson and Dr. Auleene Jamison of the "Uni-
versity -and Dr. I. Hope Alexander of the
Ci‘by’s department of lisalt-h, these tests will be
av:-Lllable ‘free of charge. ,

The Pitt News, after discovering an increas-
ing, althougli still small, number of Universi-
ties that made such tests a.va'1la.ble, investigat-
ed local facilities, found them more than ade-

quate, the necessary departments and officials
.enthusiastic to cooperate.

Even to many “intelligent” Pitt students,
syphilis is merely another horrid word. ‘They
will not talk about syphilis, they are not inter-
ested in doing something about syph1l1s-—y_et,

- according’ to Dr. Thomas Parragn. 3111‘.8‘90n. Gen-
eral of ‘the United States Public ,Health. Serv-
ice, forty-four out of every thousand‘ of the

‘United States’ population are afflicted Wlth it.
In New York State alone there are ‘ﬁfty thou-

:sand new cases annually.

To many, syphilis is the price that the “im-
'moral” must pa.y——a.lthough half’ the cases ore
‘innocently contracted through kis,s_ing_,__us1}1g

contaminated dishes and utensils, handling In-
fected paper money, and in a. hundred other
innocent ways.

Syphilis, which may be treated and cured,
today threatens the health of thousands of un-
..kne~wing persons -because society is so smug
-that-it frowns, upon the use of the word. . .

All this ‘is not pointed out to raise a scare.
‘College students ‘are too phlegmatic to scare
easily.”  , .

And the Wagsserman tests are not offered
because The Pitt News or the Student Health
Services believe the situation is worse here
.than anywhere else. The percentage “of stu-
dents having syphilis is probably less than the
percentage of the metropolitan population that

nized before the system is put into effect and
given 3. fair trial for several years. ,_
Questions which cometo mind at the moment-
.are numerous. Chief among them is the “de-
,empha.sis” of what. is now the major sport of
the collegiate world and the effect on Pitt’s
,foot.ba.l1 relations.

Provisions have been made for a return to a.
completely amateur standing for football men
—which may clarify the University’s attitude
in the mindsfof "the general public, and it is
"hoped, will possibly raise the standard of pub-
-lic relations with the athletic departments of
other schools. ' »

Critic Likes Varied
Program Of Singer

By AUSTIN HAY

It has been years, since the appearance of .any,

prima donna of the Metropolitan Opera House cen-
tered such a high degree of public interest as that

E of Rosa Ponselle, dramatic soprano, who was heard

on Friday as the initial artist of this season’s May
Beegle Concert Series. ‘

With a lovely voice of phenomenal range, with
21 repertory of hundreds of songs and a mass of
operatic arias in English, Italian, French, and Span-
ish to select from, Miss Ponselle sang magniﬁcant-
ly a rich and well-balanced program.

She was in excellent voice, a naturally sumptuous
one, and her acting abilities, for she has the natural
ﬂair of most Italians, became unobtrusively evident.

Perhaps the most fascinating of her many gra-
cious encores was Stephen. Foster’s “Way Down
Upon the Swanee River.” This immortal favorite
was accompanied by the unique combination of a
soft piano with an electric organ. ‘

A -capacity audience was none the less startled
when talented Miss Ponselle calmly seated herself
at the piano and played a charming composition
called “Dicentencellie.”‘ This singular exhibit of
versitilitl in geniw promptedsomewhatlthe tem-
erarious practice of interview. 0

“Usually,f’ she said, “I only perform ‘at the piano
when the mood strikes me. It is not a relaxation

from singing but mrely a satisfaction——-a some-

thing to be enjoyed in off moments.

“It is a pleasure to play modern compotitions,
even ja 22 if it is good. There is nothing cheaper
‘th;an"‘c‘n.eap jazz music—-if it may be called music.

I play very seldom in public; mostly at parties in

my New York apartment.”

Her vivacious voice, straight black hair, warm
brown eyes, and ruddy, almost sanguine complex-
ion shows her to be the real outdoor athlete that
she is. I think her personal. clzarm must lie in 110:.“
inexhaustible energy.

Being questioned about music and its effect upon
students, Miss Ponselle continued,

“Music is not an exclusive acquisition of genius;
like air and sunshine it belongs to all. Some ‘time
I would like to see it in the schedule of everyday
cultural life; it should be studied by the school
child as much as reading or writing.
we shall be almost as mucic conscious as Europe.

“While music has been growing so have the other
arts. People are going places and seeing things:
picture galleries, beautiful homes and parks, attend-
ing choice plays, reading ﬁne books. They decide
to throw out the antiques and install furnishings of
pleasing lines, of harmonious colors; theydemand
good books,‘homes, parks—why not good mule?”

'My many friends have both warned me that
certain unscrupulous and ruthless appendages of
1_._hVe_advertising staff, known to me as Cohen,_are

laying’ ‘in a supply of six-shooters, stilettos, and

strychnine, just in case I didn’t like Emile Zola.
That, of course, has nothing to do with my re-

actions to the picture. Emile Zola, as though you

didn’t know, is a‘ good picture. Honest, I really

liked it. I thought it was one of ‘the finest pictures;

1’ve ever seen, see. Aren’t you happy?

Hollywood, for once, lets it self go; forgets sex i

If after paying $1.50 for your ticket to the Cap
and Gown Masquerade you can still afford three

‘shows, you ought to see the Stanley, ‘too. “Vogues of,
1938",”fa film in -the new technicolor, is showing ..
there. Altho it is reminiscent ofga picture William if
enough:

Powell did..a few years ago lt‘,lS still good
to keep you-from schizophrenia. " ‘

The .color is stunning, the girls, are up to par‘

and the story doesn’t getltoo much in the way.
We are shown the House of Curson in. the throes
of making Va; wedding dress for Joan Bennet who
doesn’t wantto marry Alan Mowbray. Alan Mow-
bray, tho, is rich and very unreasonable, andh-e
burns up when ‘Joan jilts him the day of their
wedding. _
It is that which pushes him into backing Mischa
Auer in another dress making venture. Misch is
so screwy that for awhile it looks as tho Warner
Baxter and the house of Curson are going out of
business. But, dcn’t worry over it because every-
thing turns out all right. — 
Incidentally it .wouldn’t surprise me if this pic-
ture makes ‘Joan Bennet another Jean. Harlow.
She certainly has‘ what it takes. Sher certainly has.

-“Its -All Yours”, is what the Fulton marquee says‘
It isn’t allyours

but the marquee is all wrong. _
at "all. Its all Mischa Auers, the same Mischa who
is starring at" the-Stanley.’

As long as Mischa is on the screen the ’pi*c-‘turef

is a hit, but when he’s’not its very very sad. Its
a good thing he’s got a big part. Mischa’s gold-

digging, candid count is,‘ as they say in ‘the gutter,‘

is a man. In fact, he is the hero; _Madeline,is the

show case, is placed in the micldle¢

of the west wing of the Foster
Memorial. The melocleon was the
property of the composer during
the l850’s. Its chief use was for
the accompaniment of serenacling
parties in Pittsburgh and Alleghe-
ny City. -

CODLTAINS TIIREE OCTAVES

The.le_z;:s of the melodeon may
be unscrewed and placed within
the case of the instrument. Since
its total weight was only a few
pounds it could be carried with
little trouble from one part of the
city to another. It was reassemb-
led in the front ‘yard of  family
which wasto be serenaded.

The melodeon was evidently
used en‘tirel.y for serenading. lts
rmall ran,r__*,e--only three octaves
--ziaakzes it 'U.nsuita‘ole for
composition.

When Foster left Pﬂtsbiirgh in

was in existence, Mr. Josiah Kirby
Lilly of Indianapolis, the founder
of the Foster Hall Collection, pur-
chased it from the daughter of
Foster’s friend. It came to Pitts-
bugh with the rest of the collec-
tion late in 1936, and was placed
in the shrine room of the Memor-
ial when the building was dedi-
cated June 2,:1937.

FLUTE" INCLUDED

On ithis”o’c'casion the melodeon‘
" was played,p'robably for the last‘

time. . .

The wobbly condition of the
legs,-. the dryness- of the wood
‘which 'showsi-cracks in a number
of places, and the thin‘, reedy notes
of the instrument all give eloquent
proof that it must be handled with
the greatest care.

Fostel"s ﬂute is also included in
the collection. This interesting

' relic was presented by the com-

poser to a close friend, William
Hamilton, in._-1857‘. William Harn-
ilton’s grandson. Alfred Hamilton,
presented the -ﬂuteto the Univer-
sity when the corner-stone “of the
memo:’ial,_was; laid, June 3, 1935.

poser did not keep. a diary, but

fame.

Minnie has made a lot of money
for Cab. She has raised him
from an obscure gangling scat-
singer to a position where white
folks clamor for his autograph and
pay large sums of money to hear

And Cab and Minnie must have
many a smile over, the,_gullible
“ool’ahs,” the white folks, who pay
and pay for Harlem dressed in
white tie and tails. ’ .

The couvert at the New Cotton

currently holding forth, is plenty

-rus are its best customers. ' The
buyer from Terre Haute is hav-

from Mamie.

He will go home and tell all the

had in Harlem. He had seen‘
the real McCoy, the best that the
entertainment world has to offer.

 , Concegitration of classes in the

Cathedral this year has brought

g many new problems. Chief among
ithese is what ‘to do about student

lunches. A Cathedral cafeteria has
frequently been suggested, but

ihere are the official reasons why

one has never been provided:

1. To be successful, a Pitt cafe-
teria would have _to be subsidized.

2. One meal a day would not
pay for equipment and operating
expensesiin a cafeteria of the size
needed.

3. No provision was made archi-
tectually in the Cathedral for a
cafeteria. ‘

4. To remedy point 3, expensive
revlsions xvould _ be necessary.

, To offset these difficulties, the
administration provided t w o
eighth ﬂoor lunch rooms. Demand
has been so great (one room sells
100 box lunches, 230'sandwiches

ldaily) provisions for another are

now being made. ..

— It will be a boy and girl lounge
anci lunch room on the 5th avenue
side of the Cathedral’s ground
ﬂoor‘. Credit for the coming lunch
room addition goes to Howard
Engelman and Brooks Sipes, co-
chairman of the SFA lunch com-
mitts- who cooperated with the
dean of men and women.

GOLDBERG SCORES
Saturday Mr. Goldberg, who is
now only one year shy of voting
 ran to all ends of the ﬁeld.
He ran around right end and he
ran around left end. And, even

more important, he ran into the»

end zones.

During Goldberg’s brief visit
with bo *s from the Northwest, he
raced across the goal line twice.

‘Both times he stepped over he was

not within ﬁnger-touching dis-
tance of an enemy tackler.

In the very ﬁrst quarter, after
only ten minutes had been played.

Biggie headed in the general di-‘

rection that would take him wide
around right end, suddenly cut
sharp when he found an opening
and drove, six yards for the first
Pitt touchdown.
. LONG RUN
In ‘the very first of the third

ouarter, scarcely’ one minute after

the second half play had begun,"
Goldberg did it again.. He rock-
eted through right tackle, tookpda

‘gasp of the air in the fresh, opétl

country and zephyred up the side-
lines as three Badgers followed
him down the ﬁeld. —

When this play was concluded,
Dr. Jock Sutherland decided that
Marshall had studied rather» hard
and knewhis. lessons perfectly.
Accordingly the good doctor ex-
cused his star pupil from the re-
maining part of the weekly Sat-
urday quiz. Goldberg -ran over to
the showers to spend the rest of .
the afternoon; babying a badly
bruised left leg.

No sooner had Goldberg left‘ the
game than his proﬁcient under-
study, Dick Cassiano of opening"
‘day fame, came. in. Cassiano
showed that playing second ﬁddle.
to Czar Goldberg has done hirn.a.
whole. lot of good.

CASSIANO ADDS ONE

Seeming -to add that Goldberg
twist to his hips, Dandy Dick gave
added proof that he was no’ ﬂash
in an opening day sun. After pick-
ing up some pretty substantial
gains, Cassiano decided that the
Panthers were, at least, worth one
more score.

As the game tabulations show,
they were worth a good many
more. W I C

With this thought uppermost in
his mind, Cassiano lined up with
the Panthers on their
Patrick took the ball,
lunged through left tackle, stum-
bled out into the open and looked
to his left in time to see Cassiano
steaming up alongside of him.

A neat lateral pass to teammate
Cassiano gave the ball to the
sophomore as he was coming along

a he ﬁeld at top speed and Cas-

siano completed his goal line tour
of 73 yards by” out-distancing the
Badger backﬁeld. .One man caught’
up with him in time to assist him
in downing the "ball behind the
end ‘zone.
DADDIO KICKS WELL

Bill Daddio place-picked all
three extra points right through
the center of the posts in the same
manner as in a game last New
Year’s day.

Throughout the game the Pan-
thers maintained thc impression
that has been left after each of
their Saturday afternoon contests.
That is, that thet they are a slum-
bering, lethargic giant, who some
day will wake up and give some-
body an awful shaking.

The vaunted Wisconsin attack
was completely smothered by the
fast-charging Panthers .and ‘the
Pitt goal line remained uncrossed.
Pitt’s most effective offensive step
was to run wide aroundgtheends.
This policy was pursued rather
strenuously throughout thewgame
with the Pitt backs skirting the
ends frequently and just as fre-
quently going through tackle. '

Former Pitt
Backfield Star
Still Around

By HARRY LECKLER
Michael Nicksick, Pitt backfield
coach, didnft make the grade as a

‘ regular until his final season. on

the Panthers varsity, but once he
made the first team he developed
into as. fine a running back as
Pitt has ever had.

V Mike, affectionately known as
“Little Rhino” to his many friends
ion the campus, began his colorful
‘career at Burgettstown Union
_,High school back in 1927, when he
was. shattering records right and

4 left for his alma mater on the‘ cin-

der paths.

An unbelievably fast dash
man -and expert shot putter, he
was hailed as the “one-man track
team” by district scouts and creat-
ed a stir when he scored 33 points
in a Washington County track
meet during his junioryear. Cap-
tain of his high school football
team when a senior, he made
quite a namefor himself as a rug-
 ged, hard-hitting backfield man.

E Entering the University of Pitts-
iburgh in the fall of 1931, he star-
[red on the freshman grid team

and gained a varsity berth on the
Panther squad in his sophomore
year.

IN HOLLYWOOD

Pitt went to the Rose Bowl that
‘season and it was then the wise-
icrack that has dogged Mike all
,-‘through his football days was
pulled by a famous punster. After
the game, a few members of the
team were chatting with movie

spotted Mike, and ranted out,
“Nicksick and I are the only two

people in the world who can smoke

a cigar in the rain!”
Mike understudied Warren Hel-

ler in 1932. In 1933 he was handed
the varsity job, but didn’t quite
make the grade an.d gave way to
Howdy O’Dell after the first game.

In 1934, however, Nicksick was
ready, much to the dismay of all
teams that Pitt played. that year.

He ran wild against everybody,
scoring Pitt’s only touchdown

against Minnesota after a 65 yard‘

gallop.
BASEBALL PLAYER

He tried ‘the pro game in 1935,
but di.dn’t like it", and in the spring
of 1B36 came back to Pitt as back-
field coach.

This member of Jock Suther-
land’s staff is a wel1—built, dark
complexioned youth of twenty-five
and one of the most agreeable peo-
ple it has been our pleasure to
meet. Coming from a family of
athletes, his chief interest lies in
the sporting world; and when he
is not busy with grid activities, he
plays an outfield position for the
scrappy McDonald baseball team
in the City League and has built
up a reputation as a home run
hitter.

He is no longer single, taking
the plunge into the sea of matri-
mony with his high school sweet-
heart two years ago. The young
couple resides in Burgettstown.

SECOND YEAR

This is his second year with the
varsity backs, and he is well-
liked by the other members of the
University coaching staff and the
players. Easy-going and with a
kind word for everyone, Nicksick
is an invaluable addition to the
coaching roster and has done great
work in the backfield this season,
moulding it into an aggressive of-
fensive combination.

Maybe, he will begin to take
life seriously one of these days,
but right now he refus_es.to worry
about anything.

llreshman‘ Cridiliouses Divided into Bracliets
For lnterfrat Football Play

Team Subdues
Lion, 6-0

Considerably outplayed?,. the Pitt
freshman football team neverthe-
less outscored a strong Penn State
ﬁrst year outﬁt at‘ State College,
Pa., Saturday, 6-0, in the ﬁrst
game of the meager Panther
schedule. 1’

Pitt’s only touchdown‘ was made
by Bonelli, left halfback, who was
the offensive spark of the team.
Bonelli snatched a pass from Stock
and ran 10 yards for the score.
The pass covered 23 yards through
the air and was the only attempt-
ed aerial by the‘ Panthers.

The Little Panthers appeared
very weak, defensively and offen-
sively. ~ Of course, the freshmen
are never drilled‘ with a strong at-
tack. But, considering the fact.
that their practice sessions are
taken up in defensive work
against the varsity, their attempt
to stop the Lions‘ offense was
hardly impressive.

There were many times that
they were outsmarted and drawn
into positions that left them im-
potent. Figures of the game show
a pronounced’ Lion superiority.
Penn State accumulated 17 ﬁrst
downs to the Panthers’ 2. Pitt
was outgained in rushing by 233
yards to 66;.

Bonelli was the lone standout
for the Panthers. He is a triple-
threat back and played a ﬁne de-
fensive game. One of the best
features of his game is his long-
distance punting. On one occa-
sion, he stood deep in his own
territory and booted one out of
bounds on the State 3-yard line.
It was a kick of 70 yards.

Rest—Prescril)ed
By Dr. Carlson

Practise a week, rest a week,
practise a week, rest a week; that’s
the new schedule devised for the
basketball team by Dr. H. C-
“Red” Carlson, coach of the team.
The new system is placing more
emphasis on rest than usual.

Besides the weeks of rest, there
will be regular hours. When the
whistle blows, every player quits.
no matter what he is doing. ' Rest
plays an important part in the
training, so every player must
obey the rules of rest as well as
those of work.

Beginning on November 8, the
team will. have three full weeks

V of ‘training. Then on the 28th, Dr.

Carlson's strategy is to have them
play a practice game at Ligonier.
earning themselves a free meal
meanwhile. Tapering off then,
they leave a weektlater for the
opening jaunt through the west,
opening against Northwestern.

First-Round Drawings
Made For Competition
Starting Next Week

Straight from Robert L. Corley,
assistant to the dean of men,
come the drawings for the ﬁrst
interfrat touch-football tourney
due to start Thursday, November

4 on Schenley Oval.

The thirteen fraternities were
divided into two brackets for
the elimination tourney. If it
wasn’t for the fact that the draw-
ings were purely luck and pairings
were made practically from slips
in a hat, Corley would be in. line
for congratulations on a splendid
job.

A commendable leveling-off of
power and past leaders in the
league was very thoroughly ac-
complished by the chance draw.
Kappa Sigma, interfrat champs in
touch football the past two years,
and Theta Chi and Phi Epsilon
last year’s semi-f.inalists, are pit-
ted in the Blue or upper brackets.

itself in the lower bracket‘ with
the powerful Delts and Sigma
Chis to wade through to find a
place in the ﬁnals. The less
potent, but nevertheless always
dangerous frats are mixed in with
the Big Six to form a Blue brac-
ket of seven teams and a Gold of
six.

No schedules and dates have
been made as yet, but definite
pairings have received the official
stamp of the interfrat heads. Pair-
ings in the Blue bracket find‘ SAE

Lambda Chi; Phi Ep tearing into
PiKA, with Phi Kap drawing a
bye.

First round competition in: the
Gold bracket sees Sigma: Chi and
SAM opening hostilities. followed
by Phi Gamma vs Phi Delta. and
Pi Lam pitted against the Delts
to round out the bracket.

Finals are tentatively scheduled

 of the “undeclared war”.
between that country and Japan,
have affected four graduates of
the Univ'ers'ity .' we of Pittsburgh
School of Dentistry. Typhoons, air
raids at and‘ ‘armies have become
part of the experience of these
university’ men.’ -

Dr. Clement C. Wang, of the
class of 1932, has been practicing,
dentistry_in_his home city of Peip-
ing. _It-_I,e ‘ ,was "a _member ‘of the
facultyof‘ the dental school con-'
nected with the Rockefeller Med-
ical Center in that city. --‘Recent
reports indicate that the Medical
Center has been a victim of Jap-
anese air bombers. Nothing has
been heard from Dr. Wang for
several months.

Dr. Hilmar F. Sommers, of the
class of 1910, has been practicing
in Hong Kong for the past twelve
years. Dr. Sommers, in recent
air mail letters, describes the ty-
phoonithat struck~Hong Kong, and

on ships in the harbour of that
city,‘ and on Canton, which is only
Kong.

Dr. John L. Boots of the class

      

of 1910, is director of the Amer-
ican Dental Clinic in Seoul, Korea.
Dr. Boots writes of interesting and
unusual experiences;

Dr. Yu Kyung Lee, an honor
man in the class of 1937, will leave
San Francisco October 7 for
his home in Seoul, where
he expects to arrive about Novem-

graduate work in orthodontia and
expected to remain at the Univer-
sity until next year. But de-
velopments of the. war . in the
Orient which he fears will involve
Korea, a dependency of Japan,
particularly if Russia should enter
the conflict, ‘hastened his depar-
ture. Dr. Lee has a wife and tw

children -in Seoul.

A huge bowl of unspiked, un-
adulterated, pure and wholesome
punch will be on hand for those
who‘feel a little thirsty, and the
tap room of the Hotel will be open
for those who work up a real
thirst. ‘

Walt Heim, an old hand t
calling figures for old fashioned
dances, will be on hand to lead
the crowd in a Paul Jones. Gals,
you better keep close tab on your
shoes when Walt starts the Paul
Jones. Incidentally, Walt is booked
to do a little bit of “middle aislin’ ”
on November 19th, and we might
get a chance to see the next Mrs.
Walter-E. Heim at the dance.
(Editor’s Note: If my calculations
are correct, this one makes Walt
a polygamist. The first was in

Minnesota; and now he is sched-
uled for the third.)

Quarrel Scene

  Has Players
Angered

She couldn’t smack him, until——-.

Phyllis Post, Ed39, had difficul-
ty in getting angry with Bill Hoev-
ler, C39. Anger was necessary, be-
cause Phyllis and Bill were the
leads in the Pitt Players show,
“Fresh Fields.” In the show they
have to fight.

Discouraged Phyllis sat down
to think it over, but there was no
chair. Mr. Hoeveler laughed. Miss
Post scowled. Further, Miss Post
grimly asked director Carl Cass,
“,Let’s rehearse our quarrel seen
again.” _ _ .

Director Carl Cass agreed. Mr.
Hoeveler agreed. Miss Post agreed.
So they did the quarrel- scene,
wherein Hoeveler found himself
swept ‘off ih_is_,feet, almost. literal-
ly.’ Mr. _Hoeveler scowled., Miss

 

.. Post smiled. Directorcass
