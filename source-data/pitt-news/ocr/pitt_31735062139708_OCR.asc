US Back On “Gold
-Basis--’T.ippetts

     

Bus Ad Dean Talks On Monetary
System At Reception

Appearances to the contrary, opin-
ions of noted economists notwith-
standing, the United States is deﬁnite-
ly on the gold standard, the School of
Business Administi'ation’s new dean
insists.

At a reception in his honor, sponsor-
ed by the Business Administration
Alumni Association, Dr. ‘Charles S.
'l‘ippetts qualiﬁed his stateinent by
declaring that the present gold stand-
ard is a modiﬁed form of the original.

“In fact,” added Dr, Tippetts, “the
United States has been back on the
gold standard for the last 14 months,
since gold has been set at a ﬁxed price
and kept at that price.”

The dean warned the group to be
prepared for. much experimentation
of the monetary system in tlie future.
He pointed out that the prospects for
a sound international monetary sys-
tem are at present very dubious, un-
less England should return to the gold
standard. But England has shown us
that we do not need to keep gold in
actual circulation, -he believes, As a
result we may eventually decide to
abolish the gold system and adopt a
paper standard, reserving gold only
for international payments, and at any
rate, we shall have to readjust our
view of the gold standard as sacred
and secure, he affirmed.

Dr, Tippetts indicated that the bul-
lionist theory is on the wane. “The
theory,” he said, “which supposes
that the purchasing power of money
depends upon the bullionist content,
is sound as long as we have only gold
and silver money. But most of our
commerce is carried on nowadays by
checks and drafts and other paper
money.”

Dr. Tippetts also pointed out that
recovery in the gold standard coun-
tries is not up to the same level as
that in the non-gold standard coun-
tries.

In reviewing the earlier trends of
the monetary system, he declared that
the depression was prophesied by
many economists because of the scar-
city of gold.

‘Special Feature’
Reveals Military
Ball’s Who’s Who

“Wife Swapping” Tried As This,
Last Year’s Chairmen Make
Trade Of Leading Ladies

By Bernard Zei-be

This story, according to the as-
signment sheet, is classed as a “special
feat11I’e.” and is not to ‘be confused
with the regular “Pittpourri" column
that appears in The News. . The
“special feature” lies in the fact that
this isa “Who’s going with whom”

held in t_he'William Penn Hotel next
Friday night from 10-2. '

Geodge A. Roll, student colonel of
the ROTC corps, will be accompanied
by Enice Natal.i, last year's coed col-
onel; Francis McLaughlin this year’s
coed colonel will be escorted by W'il-

liam Havlak, student colonel
of the corps and Military Ball chair-
man last year. These rever-

ses .

honored "ladies ﬁrst” standard of et-
iquette, decided that Miss McLaughlin
should lead the ball. ‘So precedent.

The other ofﬁcers of the corps will
be present with the other co—ed cap-
tains, save Capt. Christensen, who will
break precedent by going with an

over the networks since early in 1933,
when he first broadcast from Atlantic
City. Black has played over the CBS
from New York night clubs.

-Baron Elliot has played at several

Dr. Silverman To Begin
Southern Lecture Tour

Dr. Alexander Silverinan, head of
the department of chemistry and in-
ternational authority on glass, who left
this morning by train on a lecture
tour that will take him through six
different states, has a private collec-
tion of glass reputed to be the fore-
most in the world from the standpoint
of art and technology.

The collection, which is housed in
his office in Thaw hall, has been gath-
ered from factories, fairs, exhibits,
stores and from friends in this coun-
try and on the Continent. Only mod-
ern glass—-—that is, glass not more than
one hundred years old——-is included.
His knowledge of glass gained from
more than thirty-ﬁve years of speciall-
zatioii in that ﬁeld, prompted the
American Chemistry Society to invite
him to deliver his lecture, “-Glass——An
indispensable factor in modern civili-
zation,” before seven sections of the

ASME Seminar Hears Inventors’
Propositions For Freak Airplanes

 

By Herbert Rackoff
The perpetual motion inventor with
his dreams of a self.-sustaining air-
plane is not considered a strictly mod-
ern enigma.

According to Captain Colbert Mc-

Darinent of the Pittsburgh district air
corps, stationed at the Municipal air-
port, the proverbial dreamer showed
himself when the government ﬁrst
entertained bids for an army air-
plane. ' ‘

In an address before the American
Society of Mechanical Engineers’ sem-
inar last Thursday, Captain McDai'-
ment read several propositions ad-
vanced by aspiring inventors, includ-
ing motorless planes, ships which
would “carry 15 full-grown men in
the best of health with a 25-horse
power. motor. and rubber-winged
planes to stand the wear and tear of
crashes,” but, as is the custom, they
all asked an initial outlay of from
$500 to $15,000.

Turning to the newest develop-
ments in aeronautical engineering,
Captain McDarment stated, “Planes
are now in the process of develop-

ment which have attained a speed. of
550 miles‘ per hour in’a*wii1d tunnel
with the aid of a 2,500 horse power
motor. These are not completed as
yet, but it has been my experience
that the inventions which work on
the blueprint in a very few years
become an accomplished fact."

“Ring Them Bells-—And Punch”

“Our newest army bomber, for ex-
ample, has an interesting attachment
whereby the wheels can. -be rolled up
into the fuselage, thus adding 20 to
30 miles per hour to the speed of" the
plane,” said the captain. “Its only
difficulty is that pilots frequently for-
get to let the wheels down before
they land, with accompanying dis-
aster. To prevent accidents, 3. red
light in the cockpit shines when the
pilot prepares to land, and it merely
remains for him to.ﬁgure out -what
the signal means. If he still forgets,
a bell begins ringing in his radio and
the sound of harps will certainly re-
mind him to let down the wheels. If
this doesn't work, an ordinary pick-
handle with a/boxing glove on one
end poised on a, coiled spring is the
last resort.”

‘ ‘The Human Adventure” Filmed
From Air In 8 Expeditions
Wins Faculty Approval

Students and faciilty of the Uni-
V‘el'SitY are going to board the good
ship “Movie” tomorrow morning and
sail for a 4,000-mile ﬂight across the
lands where mankind rose from sav-
ogery to civilization, as ,H_ G_ Wells
used to  " '

VVitli the endorsement of the facul-
ty, the permission of administrative
authorities to omit second hour class-
es, and free admittance, “The Human
Adventure” will be ﬂung across the
screen of Carnegie Music hall at 9:30
o’clock.

“The Human Adventure” is a sweep-
ing survey of man’s conquest of civil-
ization as revealed by the Oriental
institute of the Uiiiversity of Chica-
go, an Institute devoted to the recon-
struction of man’s past culture.
Specially chartered planes, profes-
sional photography and the authority
of Dr. James Breasted, director of the
Institute, make “The ‘Human Adven-
ture” one of the most impressive edu-
cational pictures ever produced.

It carries you from the formation
of the earth to the glories of ancient
Egypt, Anatolia, Syria, Iraq and Per-
sia. Before the eyes of the audience
the earth cools from a vocanic, whirl-
ing mass into land and water, plains
and oceans. Prehistoric beasts range
the new plains, glaciers slide over
the earth and retreat; man rises and
conquers fire, tools of ﬁint and ﬁnally
metal, tills the land, sails the seas and
ﬁnally the air. VVith the whole story

sketched brieﬂy, the ﬁlm moves into_

its major portion, a.n airplane journey
to the lands which were the cradle
of civilization, Egypt. Palestine, Syria,
Anatolia, Iraq, and Persia.

Included in the unusual shots are

weapons made by Stone Age men,
grain from the «days of Joseph, Kar-
nak temple, 2,000 years under con-
struction, Arniageddon, “layer-cake"
of cities, the stables of Solomon. great
king and horse trader, Iraq, legendary
garden of Eden, Persepolis, capital of
the Persian Empire, with its harem
palaces of Darius and Xerxes, destroy-
ed by Alexander the Great.
’ Dr. John J. Gcise, associate profes-
sor of liistory, in recommending the
talking picture to students said:
“ ‘The Human-Adventure’ is without.
a peer in the completeness and ac-
curacy of the historical survey shown
!II it. It is absolutely unequalled in
the realm. of photography for interest
and general knowledge about our past
civilization. No students of the Uni-
versity should miss the opportunity
to witness this, the greatest picture
of its type ever produced.”

The University has rented “The
Human Adventure” along with Carne-
gie Institute. Carnegie Tech. and the
Board of Public Education. Each of
the institutions will be given different
showings of the ﬁlm. A showing for
the general public will also be given.

Big Ball Brings ‘Em
Bacl<—A Flying

We always a good story around
this time of the year when the
-Military boys are excited about
their big, big Ball. It seems that
two former chairmen of the annual
four band extravaganza liked army
life so well—as experience in the
ROTC here—that they graduated
from Pitt right into the real army,
and in its most romantic division——
the air corps.

Eddie Wittan, C32, and George
Hatcher, C33, both took prelimin-
ary training at Randolph field in
Texas, and then flew at famous
Kelly field in the same state. Wit-
tlan, who took a turn at air mail
ﬂying while the army carried out
that function, and who cracked up
a few times since and before with-
out injury, was stationed at Lang-

, ley ﬁeld in Virginia for almost two
years. Watcher, chairman of the
notorious “Ball that never happen-
ed," was to lead the 1932 Ball,
which was cancelled.

Rumors around the Military of-
ﬁce suggest that both 'Wittan and
Hatcher may fly in for Friday
night's affair. The Phi Delts ex-
pect Hatcher to zoom over the
house any day now, and are saving
a likely cot. Wittan, lately honor-.
ably dischargcd from the service
after ﬁlling out his period of en-
listment, is now grounded. He
spent a few days last week visit-
ing at the Phi Ep house, where he
answered, “Fly to the Ball?‘-' Well,
I might drive in from Portage."

 

Sarig Expected
To Appoint Five
To Probe Board

Meetings To Take Place Here;
Wide Powers Delegated To
Test University Liberality

 

Special to The Pitt News

llarrisbiirg, Pa., March 16.»-
In accordance with a I‘eS0lllT.lOl1~
adopted by the House Thursday,
Speaker VV11son G. Sarig this
week will name a committee of
ﬁve represeiitatives, virtually all
l)emoc.rats, to investigate the al-
leged sup-p_i'es,si0n of academic frec-
(l0l“ll~’-at the. Ultiversity. ,

Representative Herman P. Eberliart-
er. Democrat, of the third Allegheiiy
county district, sponsor of the resolu-
tion and its defender against a. cross-
fire of Republican and Democrat aii-
tacli. in the Legislature, will probably

be named chairman of the inquiry
body.
Osteiisibly named to investigate

charges that free speech has been sup-
pressed at the University, a charge
brought to public attention with the
recent dismissal of Dr. Ralph E. Tur-
ner as a history professor, it was in.-
dicated the committee will delve into
other phases of administration at Pitt

Several legislators have recommend-
ed that the committee investigate the
ﬁnancial. operation of the huge stadi-
um at the University and report to
the Legislature on the distribution of
the thousands of dollars collected for
football admissions.

Although the University received an
appropriation of $1,188,000 in the 1933-
1934 biennium, Governor George E’.
Earle, who has taken a personal inter-
est in its aifairs, recommended the
appropriation be slashed to $1,100,000
for the 1935-1937 biennium. The lllouse
Appropriations committee, which will
pass upon the Govei'noi"s recommen-
dations, will receive the report. of the
investigation to aid it in its delibera-
tions.

The Inquiry committee is given
coinparatively broad powers under the
resolution which authorizes it “To ful-

ly, fairly and impartially inquire into-

and investigate the attitude of the
Board of Trustees and those in charge
of the University toward members of
the faculty and student body who,
both inside and outside the class-
rooms, advocate liberal views and
freedom of thought and expression in
the subjects of economics and politics,
and other subjects wherein academic
freedom. should be allowed.”

Permission to iiivestigate the ﬁnan-
cial affairs at Pitt is embodied in an-
other section which allows the coin-
inittee “To inquire into and investi-
gate all matters touching the Univer-
sity which are pertinent to the ques-
tion of making an appropriation of
public funds, and to ascertain whether
or not said institution is worthy of
receiving further large appropriations
of public funds.”

One of the ﬁrst courses of the in-
quiry, it was learned, will be to de-
termine what inﬂuence wealthy indus-
trialists and Republican leaders on
the Board of Trustees have had on
University policies. The committee is
fully authorized to subpoena any need-
ed witnesses or records. Hearings
probably will be held in Pittsburgh.

The Governor, and David L !Law-
rence, Democratic state chairman,
have taken a keen interestin the in-
vestigation, Lawrence, through his
control of Democratic legislators, re-
deemed his threat severalmontlis ago
to investigate circumstances of Dr.
Turner’s dismissal.

One of those being considered for a
place on the Inquiry committee is
Representative Al Tronzo, of the ﬁrst
legislative district, not so many years
ago a Pitt student himself. Wliile in
school Tronzo helped edit the short
lived “Rebel Yell” which minced no
words in its criticism of the Univer-
sity and its Trustees. 'l‘ronzo’s
chances, however, are considered.
bright, because, although. a Democrat.
he opposed the Democratic leadership
in the House in its drive to pass the.
“Ripper” bill against ‘Mayor William
N. M'cNair.

The University And Change G g .
* OMEVVHERE near the crux of the problem for the \.\:'estcirn'w_o1'lcl
stands the uiiiversity, its funcliions weighed by legislatures and
dictators, its activities- bandied about by the cliaiii press for the
greater glory of circulation. In the heat and light of these forces,
the institution of the iiiiiversity is being given molten form for a
_gcneratio'n;‘ ' - . ._ .
The issue is clear enough. Shall western society he freeor shall
‘it not? Millions of'Germans, millions of Italians raise their hands
to testify it shall not. In Germany and Italy the university has been
swept along into cycles of rationalization, where historical unreason

Yet if the United States is to escape an explosion of violence or
a fascist straiglitjacket, the university must be pla.ced out of the
reach of contemporary opinions. It must function in a sphere of
acute objective criticism, and when it speaks its words may be

Friday that the singing of “Gaudeamus igitur” become a part of

There is room for regret. that the available sources show some
of the verses missing, notably one about “'virgines”' quoted by Dr.

Scholars’ Tapping
Hits Celebrities,
Campus Bigwigs

List Discloses Activity Leaders
Who Devour Books Between
Football Kicks, Headlines

By Charles B. Holstein

'l‘npping by 16 scholastic honoraries
Friday morning carried a number of
interesting sidellghts which may or
may not pack reader-interest. Here
they are for what they’re worth.

Lots of people were tapped. as to-

. day’s first column story and Friday's

ﬁve-column banner headline intimated.
Two hundred sixty students whose
blueprints are things of beauty never
withheld from the folks at; l1ome——less
per-adventure a B slips in among the
A's or a lowly C disgraces columns
of A's and B’s———h-ad their names en-
graved in the Book of the Scholars,
with appropriate ceremonies.

The wire services, if thc_v’re smart,

will pick up the fact that the captain
of Pitt's nationally famous football
machine, C11-arles “D0c" Hartwig,
’35, mixed books with body-blocking
sufficiently to win tapping to Kappa
Phi Kappa, honorary education fra-
ternity.
. Neither Helen Rose Gibson, C, nor
Maxine Hirsli, C, winners of $100
prizes for superior scliolarsliip stand-
ing among junior women, are mem-
of social fraternities, and the
prizes were donated by the City.Pan-
hellenic association, composed of
Pittsburgh members — and alumni of
national women’s social fraternities.
Miss Gibson is a copy reader on The
News and was editor of the women’s
handbook this year, Vade Macem.
Miss Hirsh is president of Quill club,
and edited that group's artistic maga-
zine. Journeyman.

Other athletes ‘besides
ﬁgured in the honors. Among them.
William Rulie, ’36, Allentown engi-
neering student a.nd member of the
varsity swimming ' team, was recog-
nized by Sigma Tau, honorary engi-
neering fraternity. Ruhe is active in
Pitt Players’ and Cap and Gown. Ml-
chael Sowisky, ’36, track team mem-
ber, made Beta. Gamma Sigma, hon-
orary Business Administration frater-
nity.

Marcus Morgan, ’35, who won both
the Phillips medal and meinbership in
‘the American- Chemical society by
having the highest four-year average
in the history of the ‘department of
chemistry, does part time work at
the Mellon Institute of_ Industrial
Research, connected with the Univer-
sity.

Vi'il]iam "Patterson, ’35, who was
elected to Beta Gamma Sigma, has
been completing his Bus Ad course
herc—~after a. year of ease as a fresh-
man at Penn State college-—by work-
ing night shift as a. teller in a down-'
town bank, attending classes morn-
ings, and combining some sleep and
some study each all-too-short after-
noon.

Reuben Slesinger, ’36_. also elected
to that fraternity, has inaintained a
straight A average at the University.
He won the Beta Gamma Sigma
plaque award for scholastic preemin-
ence his freshman year. Slesinger
has worked on The Pitt News since
he matriculated here.

' Israel L. Goldberg, C36, was tapped
in quite a few places. Pi Tau Phi,
scholastic honorary in the College,
has him on’ the books, as does Delta
Sigma Rho, honorary forensic f1'a.ter-
nity. Goldberg gets in his studying
between serving as associate editor
of The News——a job which requires a
mere six hours a day on an average——-
and ni‘-inaging the debating team and
touring with it frequently, as he’s do-
ing now in the South giving six one-

Hartwi g

' night stand debates.

Leah Stark, C36, who puts in her
many hours regularly on The News
copy desk, was honored by Pi Sigma
Alpha, political science fraternity,
and by Pi Tau I-‘hi. Besides editing
WAA’s Sportlights newspaper due on
campus today, and worrying over
News copy in the ofﬁce and at the
printers through each week, her time
is much her own.

George Roll, '35, tapped by Kappa
Phi Kappa, probably does most of his
studying while traveling to and from
school, for he seemingly has no other
time. Colonel of the ROTC regiment,
president of Omicron Delta Kappa,
honorary activities fraternity, chair-
man of the Military Ball, treasurer of
the Student Faculty Association, and
an important personage in Scabbard
and Blade and Pitt Riﬂes. Busy
George is ever occupied.

.Tl1eI‘e are many others among the
260 who work, some who even main-
tain theniselves. completely as does
Patterson, and many who bear a
heavy burden of extra-curricular re-
sponsibility and duties, and who were
still able to maintain high scholastic
standing. It all probably suggests a
beautiful topic for the moralists, or
perhaps a great message to under-
graduatia in general.

Mendenhall To Visit
W. VV. Mendenhall, executive sec-
retary of the YMCA, will visit Chi-

For Confer

ence Cage Title

Carlson Crew Out For Revenge In Tonight’s Encounter;
Victory Means Third Straight League Crown

A packed house, a couple of powerful basketball teams, and a
title at stake, all the requirements of an ideal basketball game, be
comes a reality tonight when Dr. Carlson sends his ﬁgliting cage

team against “Sleepy” Glenn’s M

ountaineers at the \Vest \'irgin.ia

:icl.d house in a playoﬁ? game to ﬁght it out for the ﬁrst place honors
of the Eastern Intercollegiate Conference.
Also with the game the old adage, “the third time ’s a charm,”

comes into play, but with the questioné

added, “For whom?” Tonight's game’
ruarks the third meeting of the two
teams this season; the Panthers and
each marching
-.»way with top honors on one occa-
sion. In Pittsburgh last month Carl-
son's boys stepped in at the last min-
ute with Big Pete Noon batting the
ball through the hoop to nose out the

town last Vvednesday the Mountain-
eers took'advanto.ge of their home
’-:'lO0l' to gain sweet revenge while
szmacking the Panthers down hard,
-:3-26, at the same time placing them-
.-celves along with the Cats at the top
es‘ the league, forcing a playoff for the
fitle. .  '

Go‘ Get‘ ’Em, Cats

Emrick .' . . . . . . . .G . . . . . .. Mestrovic

Coach Glenn's tea-in showed plenty
of formin walloping the Panthers as
they did ‘last Vvednesday, and as a re-
sult places tonight’s» battle as a toss-
up. with the Mountaineers perhaps
‘holding the edge since the game is
on their home court. ‘However, Dr-
'l.‘.arlson has a‘ habit of coaching teams
tliat ﬁght best when the going looks
‘rough, all .of which shows that the
¥._raine will be a ﬁtting climax to the
greatest district ﬂoor season, and that
the 4,000 fans who jam the ﬁeld house
are in for. authirilling-.evening. .

In the game, Glenn plans to send
the same starting team that whipped
the Panthers Wednesday against the
Holden Cats tonight. Ally Colebank
and Jack Gockewill probably be in
there at forwards. Captain Joe Sty-
dahar is a sure bet for the center post,
and Andy Mestrovic and “Squint”
Phares will again take good care of
the guard positions." Sill Simpson,
who scored 11 points against the Cats
in their last meeting, .-"will probably
see a good deal of action during the
evening at one of the forward posi-
l.lOI1S.

Dr. Carlson also will place his bets
on the same ﬁve p-layers. -Claire Cribbs
and Skippy Hughes, the Panther. co-
captains and graduating varsity men,
play for the last time under the Blue
and Gold colors. Hughes will be team-
ed at the forwards along with Ted
iloderick. Pete Noon will be at cen-
ler, and Claire Cribbs and Ross Em-
rick rate the starting posts at guards.

The Pitt-‘West Virginia. game to-
night closes the season’s schedule for
both teams. At present, each team
has won six games and lost two con-
ference battles, with the little fracas
tonight certain to crown a champion
of the league.

MAT MATTERS

___.._ By Lloyd Conley

Step inside the ring and get a hold
on the wrestling dope.
’l‘cmarelli—Younger brother of the
boxing star, is one .of the best pros-
pects in years. Fast, at home on the
rust and willing to learn: he is head-
ing for and going places.
Gu_v—Between‘ grunts and groans
Cu)’. 185 pounds of beef, shows a
great deal of improvement over the
inexperienced lad he was a month
ago. ‘Keep your eye on this lad.
Stark——The “watch-charm" guard on
the gridiron, is a good bet for the
mat team. He has the ability to de-
relop into one of the finest 155-'pound-
erg Pitt has ever turned out. He has
9. natural athletic ability and knows
the defensive side of the game.
Kadoshov—Alex could develop into
a good 175-pounder if he would get
down to business. He's strong and
has speed; with more experience and
spirit he should be good.
Nicksick—He's out to win and that’s
inst what he does. VVhere inexperi-
ence detracts, ‘strength makes up. He
has room for improvement, especially
on the defense. »
Conley—And then there was the
wrestling coach at a large. Eastern
university, who, when getting no re-
sults from a squad of over 60 men.
had painted on the ceiling ‘above the
mat in large red, whitepandblue let-
ters, “If you can read this, get up,
you're on your back." .
Captain Detzel—Fa'st, strong, “ag-

 

gressive, experienced and---‘champion. _

In the Dental playoffs to determine
