“I love Titusville,” stated sopho-
more Lisa Musko, a student at the
Titusville campus of the University
of Pittsburgh. “It‘s a great place to
go."
Musko spoke in defense of the
Titusville campus after the provost’s
planning committee recommended
that it close. The.committee’s rea-
sons for recommending the closing
of the campus include its small en-
rollment and the low grade point
average of the students who attend
the smallest branch campus of the
university. ’

The University of Pittsburgh at
Titusville is a two-year school that
offers an undergraduate academic
program with basic courses for the
freshman and sophomore years. In
addition, the campus offers an asso-
ciate degree in fields such as super-
VISIOFI technology, applied commun-
ications and accounting.

The campus has a full-time enroll-
ment ranging from 250 to 300 stu-
dents. Housing offers the students a
choice from a dormitory and II
town house units. There are approx-
imately 45 faculty members, both
full- and part-time; this provides stu-
dents with a good student-faculty
ratio.

“Some classes have only l0 people
in them, so the faculty is able to
work closely with the students,”
according to D.J. Bradley, currently
a student at U.P.T. “You can get to

know them [the faculty members].”
When asked about the proposed
campus closing, Bradley replied that
he felt there was “no reason to close
the campus. The student union was
just built, and the campus is defi-
nitely good for the town."

“There was a drop in enrollment
after the first term this year,” John
Baldwin pointed out, who is also a
second-year student at U.P.T. “It
was mostly freshmen that left. There
is a bad atmosphere there —- bad for
academics, due to the [small size of
the campus] and the closeness of the
students.”

When asked about the weaknesses
of U.P.T., Bradley replied that per-
haps the advisors could be better
informed as to knowing what classes
a student needs to take in order to
assure transfer to the main campus
(Oakland) or any other Pitt campus.

Dr. Samuel Johnson, president of
the Titusville campus: expressed

hope for the future of the campus:

“When I came to the Titusville cam-
pus one year ago, we knew that we
would have until spring until the
final recommendations came out
from the provost’s committee. We
don’t expect the final decision until
May. The present situation of the
campus is now being studied. A con-
sultant has been brought in from the
Arthur D. Little Company in Bos-
ton. This consultant meets with stu-
dent groups and committees to
review the characteristics of the
campus and its position in the
community.”

Heyward goes before panel

By Mark A. Sindler
The Pitt News

The vice president of student
affairs is expected to rule late next
week on possible sanctions recom-
mended during a Judicial Board
hearing for Panther running back
Craig Heyward.

After Wednesday’s hearing, Dr.
Conney Kimbo said he expects to
receive the five-student panel’s
recommendations by Monday at the
latest. “I would make my decision
within a week,” he said, upon receipt
of the detailed information from
hearing coordinator Dr. Dennis
Donham.

According to Heyward’s attorney
and a source close to the proceed-
ings, the nearly 13-hour hearing
resulted in both I-Ieyward's being
found guilty of breaking Pitt’s code
of conduct and the board’s recom-
mending five sanctions against Hey-
ward. The freshman had allegedly
attacked two students with a crutch
during the early hours of Jan. 22.
Reportedly suffering a variety of
injuries, both sophomore Matthew

Black and freshman Stephan Hast-'

ings required outpatient hospital
treatment after the confrontation on
the fifth floor of Tower A.

According to that same source,
requesting anonymity, the board
initially voted 4-1 for disciplinary
dismissal,'or permanent expulsion.

After further deliberations, board
‘members recommended:

In recent years, people have
grown accustomed to hearing about
space travel] and research. Astro-
nauts routinely blast off in the space
shuttle to launch satellites and per-
form experiments. Most may not be
aware, however, that the University
of Pittsburgh has been involved in
space research for over 20 years. The
organization which has handled
most of that research is the Space
Research Coordination Center.

Dr. Frederic Kaufman is the cur-
rent director of the center. Accord-
ing to Kaufman, SRCC was
originally started with funds pro-
vided by NASA. In the early 1960s,
as plans for the Apollo moon land-
ings were being drawn up, NASA
officials realized that not much was
known in the basic sciences about
space itself. So, not only at the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh,”but at univer-
sities all over the nation, funds were
provided to support research in the
basic sciences. According to Kauf-
man, money was provided to the
University of Pittsburgh for a three
phase buildup.

In phase I, which lasted from
roughly 1963 to 1967, money was
provided for a building to house
laboratory experiments and for
recruiting faculty. In addition, local

attend class but could not represent
Pitt in any official capacity, includ-
ing on the football team.)

0 Psychiatric examination one
hour per week for one year.

0 Social work for one hour per
week for one year. I

Allan Sodomsky, a third—year Pitt
law school student representing
Heyward, said the closed hearing
was divided in half. First the board
determined Heyward’s guilt or inno-
cence, and then in the late afternoon
went into what is known as the
“sanctions phase."

The board found Heyward guilty
of three offenses listed under the
code’s “Offenses Related to Per-
son(s)” and of not observing quiet
hours as listed (8 p.m. to 8 a.m.,
Sunday-Thursday) under the “Sup-
plemental Residence Hall
Provisions.”

After listening to the board’s find-
ing, Sodomsky noted a discrepancy
between what he heard and the
actual charges listed.

“The panel, after deliberating for
about an hour, found Mr. Heyward
guilty — in my words — they found
him guilty of recklessly, recklessly,
hurting another person,” Sodomsky
said. “They did not say he intention-

m aids

foundations also provided matching
funds to support space research.

In phase II, which overlapped
with phase I to some extent, NASA
concentrated on the engineering
aspects of space research. Seed
money was provided for various
engineering projects, and the dean of
the School of Engineering became
the director of SRCC.

Kaufman said phase III was to
focus on long-range space related
research, but after the sucessful
Apollo moon landings, congres-
sional interest in space research
declined, and NASA funding ran
out. This happened in I971. “After
that, we went to ‘standby’ with
NASA. But the whole program
nationwide was a great success,”
Kaufman said.

Kaufman became director of the
center in 1975. It was in research
centers like the SRCC, he said, that
the nation first became aware of the
problems with the ozone layer that
happened because of pollution. For
example, in the early 1970s, research
at the SRCC determined that super-
sonic transport planes might eat up
the ozone layer of the upper atmos-
phere, with disastrous effects on the
environment. It was at the SRCC

L

that research showed that flourocar- ~

bon propellants in spray cans would
also cause damage to the upper
atmosphere. Today, most of the
research which goes on in physics
and chemistry is concentrated on
upper atmospheric studies.

ally hit someone, that he willfully
hurt someone.”

Two of the code charges include
“intentionally, carelessly, or reck-
lessly abuses physically or injures
another person physically or emo-
tionally” and “intentionally slanders
or libels another person."

Sodomsky added: “They found
him guilty of recklessly — they did
not find that he intentionally hurt
somebody — only recklessly. The
word chosen is ‘recklessly.’ They did
not choose to use the word
‘intentionally.’

“lt’s important because you treat
people differently who make a mis-
take. A mistake made intentionally
has to be different from one made
recklessly." ‘

Black’s attorney, Phil Fabiano,
also a third—year Pitt law student,
refused to comment publicly so as to
abide by provisions of the Buckley
Amendment.‘Passed as part of the
Family Education Rights and Pri-
vacy Act of 1974, the amendment
includes students’ legal rights to
block public disclosure of his aca-
demic records without his expressed
consent.

“I would be violating the privacy
provision of the Buckley Amend-
ment by discussing any aspect ofthis
case,” said Fabiano, who is
employed as legal advocate for the
Office of Judicial Affairs.

According to Sodomsky, the
Office of Residence Life originally
recommended three sanctions,

sciences

Dr. Edward Zipf has been with
the SRCC since 1964 - before the
SRCC building was built. Most of
his experiments involve launching a
sounding rocket into the upper
atmosphere. The sounding rockets
are launched from ranges at Church-
ill, in northern Canada, White
Sands, N.M. and Wallops Island
Va.

Zipf said that some of his experi-
ments are really quite simple. “In
some of our rocket payloads, we
have a refrigerator which cools
down a chamber to about l5 degrees
Kelvin —— which is pretty close to
absolute zero. Basically, we freeze a
little part of the atmosphere, bring it
back to earth and analyze the sample
for its component elements. The rea-
sons why we freeze that part of the
atmosphere is because, at those alti-
tudes, [40 to 50 kilometers above the
earth], the density and pressure is
very different than at lower alti-
tudes. We get a much ‘larger‘sample
this way, because of Boyle’s [gas]
laws," Zipf said.

“We look at only a small part of
the atmospheric puzzle this way,”
Zipf said. “What we’re trying to do is
build up the knowledge base of
upper atmospheric data. Hopefully,
that will enable us to predict its
behavior, so we can predict the
effects of pollutants better. But the
only way to go there is literally by
rocketship,” Zipf said.

campus, Johnson points out that the
emphasis will be more on regional
needs. Although the focus of the
campus will be more on the two-year
programs currently being offered,
the branch will continue to sendjun-
iors to the Oakland campus.
Johnson said the strength of the
Titusville campus is that it provides
students with an alternative to going
directly to a large urban campus.
There is, he said, a close interaction
between students and faculty. He
also said that the extracurricular
activities offered provide an oppor-
tunity for students to develop their

Campus

leadership skills.

“I feel that the main strength of
the Titusville campus is in its activi-
ties,” said Carolyn Mancinelli, cur-
rently a junior at Pitt’s Oakland
campus. “The only problem is that it
is so small, and you can’t do much
with such a small amount of
people.”

Mancinelli attended the Titusville
campus for her freshman and sopho-
more years. While at the branch
campus, she participated in a
number of activities, and was the
president of the Student Activities
Board, and the vice president of stu-
dent government.

SRCC, Dr. Manfred Biondi, spe-
cializes in solar terrestrial physics.
This branch of physics seeks to
explain what happens when energy
from the sun in the form ofradiation
and high-energy particles strikes the
earth’s magnetosphere (the earth’s
magnetic shield) and the earth’s
atmosphere.
“Some interesting things happen

from 100 miles on up in altitude in
the earth’s atmosphere,” Biondi
said. “Periodically, solar wind parti-
cles trapped in the magnetosphere
dump into the upper atmosphere of
the earth, setting off geomagnetic
storms. The storms raise the ‘nor-
mal’ temperature-of 1,500 degrees
Fahrenheit to 3,000 degrees Fahren-
heit, and set off windstorms with
velocities of up to 1,000 miles an
hour,” Biondi said. “These storms
can black out long-range radio sig-
nals and earth-to-satellite communi-

cations,” Biondi said.

In his studies with solar terrestrial
physics, Biondi has used three obser-
vatories — one on Laurel Ridge near
Ligonier, another one in Peru and
one in Kwajelain Island in the South
Pacific. “We only visit Kwajelain for
about a month at a time,” Biondi
said. “Lately, we‘ve been using the
observatory in Peru. Both are close
to the equator, where the effects of
geomagnetic storms are most severe.
Our observatory on Laurel Ridge
gives us the opportunity to observe
what happens during the storms at
the middle latitudes,” Biondi said.

The trailer located in the SRCC
parking lot isn’t someone’s house ——
it, too, is one of Biondi’s projects.
The trailer houses an observatory
controlled by a microprocessor to
observe the effects of solar radiation
on the earth's upper atmosphere.
“We can take it anywhere there’s a
road. Right now, it's scheduled to go

to Boston for observations with a
large radar similar to one used for
radio astronomy. The radar
observes what happens with the
ionized regions of the atmosphere,”
Biondi explained, “while our obser-
vatory looks at what happens to the
neutral regions.”

Eventually, researchers hope to
set up a worldwide network ofsolar
observatories in the same way the
National Weather Service has a net-
work of reporting stations. Instead
of reporting the weather, these sta-
tions would plot solar activity.
According to Biondi, however,
those stations won't be established
for a long time.

“The big thing,” Biondi said, “is
for us to understand how solar activ-
ity affects life on earth." For the
group of researchers at the SRCC,
the big thing is to understand how
activity in space affects life on earth.

Heyward goes before panel

mended on Wednesday. Sodomsky
said the Office of Residence Life
originally wanted Heyward perma-
nently expelled from Pitt, then
asked for a two-year, complete sus-
pension, and then settled on a one-
year suspension.

“Our argument was [the sanc-
tions] were too severe," Sodomsky
said. “We don’t feel that because ofa
mistake, because a student makes a
mistake, that the university should
close the classroom doors because of
that mistake.”

Because the Office of Judicial
Affairs placed a gag order on the
case, attempts by The Pitt News to
contact the panel members proved
fruitless.

Black said he would not comment
on aspects of the hearing until
Kimbo reached a decision. Mean-
while, he is still considering filing a
civil suit against Heyward, who still
faces one count of simple assault.

Black, a religious studies major,
said he suffered various facial injur-
ies and said 40 stitches were required
to close one wound.

“I‘ll have to see the outcome of
this hearing,” he said yesterday,
“[and see] what other action is
taken.

“It also depends on how many
medical bills I’ll have. The doctors
don’t know how much plastic
surgery I might need.”

During Wednesday’s hearing
many witnesses were called, includ-
ing head coach Foge Fazio and
assistants Ron Turner and Andy

Last night thousands of people
crowded into Carnegie Music Hall
to hear David Hockney, a renowned
English artist, give a lecture on per-
spective. The lecture was sold out.

A part of his lecture featured a
brilliant discovery that Hockney
made concerning 32 paintings
Picasso did in a 10-day period in
1965. These works of art had always
been considered individual
paintings.

After Hockney purchased a 33-
volume set on the works of Picasso,
he began “an incredible journey of
Picasso and began to understand the

Noted artist speaks on art perspective

process," he said. He then realized
that these 32 paintings were all a part
of a series, but Picasso never told
anyone they were all a series. Hock-
ney stated: “This was a series that
Picasso had intended.”

The series deals with himself as an
artist and a female model. In each of
the 32 paintings, Picasso paints from
a slightly different view. In one the
model would be giddy, in another
feminine.

The series starts with Picasso
looking at a model, drawing her,
looking at her again, putting on ﬁn-
ishing touches and looking again.

Hockney described it: “He
[Picasso] goes through a series of
looking through his eyes at the age
of 84 and seeing something new and
different. Some of these paintings
had only 37 brush strokes  I can

tion and it has built-

understand why Picasso couldn‘t
stop painting. It was because his dis-
coveries were amazing — they were
profound.”

He then moved on to discuss pho-
tography and his own works as illus-
trations. He said, “A camera, is a
renaissance invention and it has
built-in perspective.” He attacked

photographic perspective because
“it robs artists of a perspective which
has been developing for centuries.”

Hockney showed a “photograph"

I which had used good perspective. It
was 80 photographs of a garden in
Japan which Hockneyrhad cut and
pasted together. He said, “This pho-
tograph is an account of my head
moving.” After studying this piece,
one could see that Hockney was

right.

Hockney is known for his paint-
ing, draftsmanship, photography,
printmaking and set designs for
theatre. According to Jack Lane,
“He portrays scenes of Los Angeles
[his residence] with wit, irony and

sophistication.”

British-born David Hockney was

  page 3

raised in Bradford, England, where

he was born in 1937. His artistic tal- I

ents were discovered by a teacher
who encouraged Hockney’s parents
to enroll him in a local school.

He graduated from the Bradford ‘

College of Art in I957 and the Royal
College of Art in 1962. He visited
Los Angeles in I963 and stayed there
for three years; today, this is his per-
manent residence.

A famous work of his can be seen
at the Carnegie Institute. It is a por-
trait of Divine, a 300-lb. transvestite.

Hockney’s lecture was sponsored
by the HJ. Heinz Company Foun-
dation and is part of a series entitled
“Man and Ideas.” His lecture was
titled “On Art and How We See.”

(UPI) — According to a newly
published guide by Rand Mc-
Nally Co., Pittsburgh is the best
place in the U.S. to live.

In its book Places Rated
Almanac, Rand McNally exam-
ined 329 metropolitan areas
around the country and deter-
mined that Pittsburgh was the
top city.

It rated the cities by climate
and terrain, housing, health care,
transportation, education, the
arts, recreation and economic
outlook.

The news was greeted with
I pride in Pittsburgh. “Why, I‘m
really glad to hear it,” said city
controller Thomas Flaherty.
“This will be one giant step to
change the city’s image that it’sa
smoke steel town. Pittsburgh is
not Utopia, but where is
Utopia?”

The almanac, subtitled “Your
guide to finding the best places to
live in America,” rated Pitts-
burgh’s climate and terrain 87th.
Housing was rated as 186th;
health care, 76th; transportation,
76th; education, 7th; the arts,
12th; recreation, 90th; economic
outlook, l85th.

Along with the best, there is
also the worst. Yuba City, Calif.,
was rated as last of the 329 cities
examined by the publishing ﬁrm.

Mayor Chuck Pappageorge
called it “a slap in the face.” He
added that it would not have

been so bad if Yuba City had
been rated second-worst because
the city would have avoided all
the bad publicity.

The patient,‘ Mary Cheatham
of Lake Worth, Texas, is in criti-
cal condition at Presbyterian-

To Work As One

Every student organization operates from a foun-
dation of some common interest, whether it be a
political end, an educational goal, or a shared
hobby. Members of such a body, as many of us are,
need to first recognize that it is common ground that
prompted them to approach the group and desire
participation within it. Once we freely choose to
enter a student organization, we should try to keep
the group’s objectives superior to, though not separ-
ate from, our own. What the individual wishes to
gain from participating in, or being recognized by,
that group should be of secondary importance.

No individual has a legitimate right to undermine
or interfere with a group’s progress by subjecting
others to the satisfaction of his personal ends. Such a
§i.ti;ati9.I3..n9t .9.ri.1.y..<i3.1.rnpet1s. cre.a.ti_vity but destroys
any sense of solidarity with which the group was
born, rendering it virtually unfunctional.

It may be this sort of organizational constipation
that plagues Pitt. Several students have complained
that the Student Government Board is ineffective,
that The Pitt News suffers alack of quality, and that
the student body, in general, is entirely too compla-
cent. It is a sad fact that many of us enter into these
obligations with nothing more than a resume in

mind or an axe in hand.

A student group that makes open communication
and equal participation in the attainment of its goals
the prime value and does not allow those objectives
to be thwarted by self-serving individuals, is a crea-
tive and, hence, effective student body. It has been
predicted that such a strategy, when sincerely
pursued, will consequently result in the attainment
of one’s own personal goals through the realization

of another’s.

The primary objective of a student organization,
be it an athletics club, the Student Government, a
special interest organization or your everyday litera-
ture course, is intellectual and emotional growth
through anuninhibited exchange of ideas. Growth is
an essentially cooperative, though not necessarily

compromising, process.

Letters to the E ditQL

To Walk Freely

The setting is late at night; you are

on your way home from a party. The
cold air whistles through the trees,
and the shadows ofthe branches cast
from a lone streetlight stretch out
like long, icy elongated fingers. You
recall the newspaper's stories of the
rash of muggings that have occured
near here.
_ Ahead, a group of seven persons
suddenly appear. You reassure
yourself, “They don't look like
muggers, they’re just talking.” Just
to be sure, though, you turn and
walk in the opposite direction. They
follow you, keeping in stride with
every step.'They converge on you.
You wonder‘ to yourself, “Where are
the police?” Or perhaps you glance
around, quickly though, looking for
a friend.

This situation has been expe-
rienced by many students on cam-
pus. The psychological effect on a
victim who has been violated can be
terrifying, and one can only wonder:
When will it happen again?

It should not happen again. We
should not be afraid to walk freely
around our campus. Let’s face it, the
campus police cannot be everywhere
all the time (unless, of course, you
happen to be in the “Original” at
that specific time).

With a little help, we can make
our streets safer. The Guardian
Angels are offering this help.The
Guardian Angels are the students:
they are your friends and neighbors.
They feel the same fear that eve-
ryone does but are willing to do
something to change it.

Who runs the streets anyway? The
muggers, rapists and robbers? Some
high school punks who enjoy hold-
ing people up? Or the people who
have lived here for years trying to
make an honest living and the stu-
dents who attend college here?

The Angels are here to try and
help the police fight crime. We are
not vigilantes. We are students fight-
ing for ourselves. We_are the stu-
dents’ advantage over crime. So
support the Guardian Angels and
support yourself. We dare to care!

Letter Deserves An
X

If you haven’t heard, the Student
Government Board suspended the
actions of the Affirmative Action
Committee at its last weekly meet-
ing. Chairman Jackie Jackson failed
to submit bylaws approved by the
committee. In Wednesday’s Pitt
‘News, Rod Dixon responded to the
article written by Alison Sterne
about the SGB meeting.

Dixon falsely purported himself
as the “Advisor to the Affirmative
Action Committee." The commit-
tee, in reality, has no advisor except
the Student Government- Board
advisor, and that is not Dixon. In
fact, since Dixon is not a non-CGS
undergraduate, he should have no
relationship with the committee to
begin with.

Dixon claims that The Pitt News
received an F in journalism once
again. Well, if that article deserves
an F, Dixon's letter deserves an X.

Did Jackson confirm plans for a
minority recruitment fair, a fair that
would extend way beyond the duties
and responsibilities of the student
government? She drew up a letter to
send to all the high schools in the
area and asked the SGB secretary to
have it mailed. A portion ofthe let-
ter read, “The Affirmative Action
Committee and the Admissions and
Student Aid Office ofthe University
of Pittsburgh will be sponsoring a
recruitment fair Thursday, March
I4, for the purpose of exposing
minority high school students to the
programs and facilities that the uni-
versity can offer them.“ The letter

goes on to list workshops and semi-
nars planned. This was all done
without the knowledge of the
Admissions Office or SGB.

The question of whether her com-
mittee approved bylaws or not is
clear-cut, Mr. Dixon. Jackson her-
self stated that the committee had
not approved the bylaws by the
deadline at the SGB meeting last
week. The committee has not had
bylaws, and no one seems to know
when the mysterious meeting was
held to approve the bylaws. .

Dixon claims that SGB refused to
give the committee money to recruit
members. This is false. The board
approved emergency requests for
Pitt News ads. They did not, how-
ever, approve requests for full-page
ads in The Pitt News as was
requested by the committee. SGB
president Luke Kluchko said that no
committee has used full-page ads for
recruitment. Jackson also had 2,000
letters printed and dated in
November for recruitment, and they
were never distributed. Since they
were dated in November, they are
now useless, and the cost involved in
printing the letters was wasted.

The board asked all of the com-
mittees to fill out a questionaire that
included the definition of the com-
mittee’s purpose and a statement
showing how the committee benefits
the board. The Affirmative Action

Committee was created to aid the

SGB’s bylaws. It was not created to
be an independent agency. The
board simply asked all the commit-
tees to complete a questionnaire. Is
this too much to ask?

Dixon claimed the board decided
that the Affirmative Action Com-
mittee was no longer a standing
committee. This is false. It was only
suspended.

Dixon states, “The board decided
that handicapped students should
populate the committee instead of
black students and female students.”
This is absolutely false. The board
asked that there be recruitment of
handicapped students in addition to
blacks and women.

Jackson’s response to this at a
public SGB meeting was: “My com-
mittee was asked to recruit more
handicapped students. Why should
we? Is there a need to have more
handicapped students at the univer-
sity?” This is a statement from the
chairman of the Affirmative Action
Committee, folks.

Mr. Dixon, your research was
faulty. The Affirmative Action

, Committee has shown that SGB is

having problems with them, not the
other way around. The committee

needs to get its act together, and it

might be in the best interests of the
committee to do it under a new
chairman.

Bloomsburg Diary

Hunter S. Thompson popularized
“gonzo journalism" ~ the style of
writing in which all facts are ficti-
tious. In “Bloomsburg Diary" (Feb.
22), Adam Eisenstat and Craig
Mullen perverted this ideal, such
that all facts are factitious. The dif-
ference is greater than that of a sin-
gle vowel; the record must be set
straight lest we asphyxiate in the
efﬂuvium of scatologic prose.

Our journey commenced with the
authors of “Bloomsburg Diary”
indulging in a five-hour, non-stop
diatribe of mental masturbation the
likes of which have not been seen
since the days of press conferences
during the Vietnam War. It ended
(as do many futile exercises in
anarchy) as a column in The Pitt
News. '

Prior to our arrival, Bloomsburg
was pure and wholesome, uncor-
rupted by the invading armies of
tournament participants. My team-
mates burst upon the scene with the

alacrity of vultures preparing for a
feast of entrails. Their goals were as
apparent as those of virgins in a bro-
thel: win the College Bowl tourna-
ment, get drunk and get laid, not
necessarily in that order. Their
second goal was realized soon
enough, at Bill Hess’s Tavern. Craig
Mullen asked to meet Bill Hess;
unfortunately, the man has been
dead for quite some time. They dis-
cussed their plans with Larry, the
bartender; he decided to hire a body-
guard to protect his l2-year-old
daughter —— at least until Adam and
Craig left town.

The College Bowl matches were
tense and punctuated by the total
lack of decorum exhibited by Adam
and Craig. As captain ofthe team, I
was forced to baby-sit for these two,
preventing them from riling the
judges on several occasions.
Granted, the officials made a few
bad calls, but arguing with them
made no sense. Although Adam and
Craig referred to Jim Haug and
myself as “steely-eyed competitors,”
Jim and I were the ones who told the
Lehigh team members to “lighten up
— it’s only a game.”

After our elimination from the
competition, Jim was fairly disap-
pointed; Adam and Craig were nota-
bly distressed since their first goal
had just been shot to hell, and went
off to sulk by themselves; I really did
not care, and left to watch the ping-
pong final with a friend. Jim and I
had no reason to complain to others
about our teammates’ failures and
shortcomings; after all, these attrib-
utes are readily evident to any indi-
vidual more intelligent than a clam.
Although semi-decent fellows, I dis-
missed them as belonging to DSM
III category 295.32 -— paranoid schi-
zophrenia, especially considering
their unfocused anxiety, argumenta-
tiveness and fear of homosexuals. I,
of course, did not attend the same
parties as Adam and Craig; reveling
in sewers with the moral dregs of
society isn’t exactly what I consider
to be a fun time.

Adam and Craig arrived at the
banquet for tournament partici-
pants with two Bloomsburg bimbos,
and spent the evening “entertaining”
a middle-aged couple who appeared
visibly nauseated by their company
at the dinner table. Jim and I spent
much of the meal ridiculing a player
on an opposing team from a dis-
tance; his name was Rif. Rif was a
human chastity belt, sent by God to
prevent heathen from deflowering
Bloomsburg. He personally checked
I50 tables to insure that margarine
had not been substituted for butter.
He was a man on a holy mission. I
later sent a prescription for Quaa-
ludes to an overly boisterous and
annoying table. They got the mes-
sage and quieted down, but only
after proposing a toast in my honor.

And what of the third and final
goal of Adam and Craig? They suc-
ceeded in raping the morals and
psyche of Bloomsburg. Fortunately,
the damage done by these left-wing
heathens has already been forgotten.
Bloomsburg is once again a shining
symbol of middle America and must
be revered and preserved as a dying
species, not ridiculed as an anachro-
nism in this era of computer chip
technology. God bless Ronald Rea-
gan. God bless America!

The grim rewards of good reporting

by Michael Selz

The Mean Season is a great idea that
almost works. Exploring the separa-
tion — or absence of it -— between a
journalist and the story he covers,‘
this is interesting terrain, barely
touched on by its closest relative,
Absence of Malice. The story here cer-
tainly grabs the issue. The problem is
simple: made-for-TV movie editing.

Based on a novel by real-life news-
paperman Joel Katzenbach called In
the Heat of the Summer, The Mean Season
has Kurt Russell as Malcolm Ander-
son, a disaffected reporter for the fic-
titious Miami journal. He's all set to
pack it in and run the newspaper in
his girlfriend's (Mariel Hemingway)
hometown of Colorado, presumably
a place where nothing happens.

RRRing! It's a phone call from a guy
who just put a gun to the head of an
innocent nymphet. (Typically, this is
shown in the first scene of the film-
the faceless killer, the girl, the swirl-
ing grainfield.) The killer likes
Anderson's article about his misdeed,
promises a couple more killings and
says, "I want you to be my conduit to
the public.”

From here, it's a series of phone.

calls and execution-style murders. As
Malcolm himself becomes a media
event, his girlfriend becomes dis-

become a collaboration."

The police are doing little more
than counting bodies, and Malcolm
faces his complicity and his fear,
because ultimately the fame—hungry
murderer becomes jealous of Mal-
colm, who's become bigger than his
subject. '

So what's wrong with this? First,
the red herrings. There are several
ridiculous suspense build-ups that
come to nothing. An old trick, to be
sI_1re_,_b_u_t_here it undermines the real

 
       

thing. It's like the boy who cried wolf.
When really scary stuff happens,
you'll be skeptical. You're not going
to fall for that one again.

Second problem: You feel like you
know exactly how things will end up.
The techniques for showing action
and reaction are as subtle as a steam-
roller. For example, at one point Mal-
colm is interviewed on the "Today"
show. We already know that his
sweetie is no longer among his most
ardent supporters, but the filmmak-

ers still feel compelled to break from
the interview to show a shot of her
looking disgustedly at her TV. Such
heavy-handedness belongs in televi-
sion, not in a film by the director of
the thoughtful and lyrical The Grey
Fox.

It's like the boy who
cried wolf... you're
not going to fall for
that one again.

To its credit, this film has the most
interesting psychopath (Richard Jor-
dan) I've seen in a long while. Asked
pointblank by a potential victim if
he's going to kill her, he replies with
good-humored exasperation: "All
you think about is dying. Let's try to
keep these things as abstract as possi-
ble.” He's quite obviously bonkers yet
shows a sober intelligence that is
more chilling than your average
treatment.

Then there's the gritty newspaper
aphorisms: "Reporters report. We're
not the manufacturers — we're
retailers." It's hard for a journalist to
pan a movie about journalism, even

A BETTER WORLD! It R-A-'5 F0Om t

by Stan Thomas Wozniak

Yes, Virginia, there are films that
are worth seeing that don't have
Eddie Murphy cackling around every
corner and that don't have puffed-up
hit soundtracks. On rare occasions do
they crash—land in Pittsburgh. (Repo
Man did; Choose Me and Stranger Than
Paradise have yet to.)

A new ”cult" film has made it to the
city. It's called The Gods Must Be Crazy,
and while it's not a perfect film, it's
engaging and funny. The Gods Must Be
Crazy is a 1980 comedy which is now a
sleeper in America after becoming a
hit overseas in Japan and France. It's a
comedy with such an insane and pre-
dictable storyline that you begin to
wonder if it's just a spoof of a spoof.

Slapstick takes on new meaning in
the film as a tribe of Bushmen in Bot-
swana's Kalahari Desert discover an

bottle is an "evil thing.” Children
begin to beat each other over the
head with it. Exactly what is going on
here?

Do the numerous eleventh-hour
rescues signify the presence of gods
somewhere? Is the film a statement
about the backwardness of the Bush-
men's culture or a mocking summary
of African politics? Or is director
Jamie Uys merely trying to upstage
Woody Allen? (One particular scene
in the film is homage to Allen's own
Bananas.)

Only Uys knows for sure. He is
more than the director of the film.

He's also listed as producer, writer,

editor, actor and cinematographer.
The actor's shirts probably have
union labels with his name on them.
He also manages to coax an inspired,
if self—effacing, hilarious perfor-
mance from the Bushman Nlxau.
He's a real Bushman, but evokes
Charlie Chaplin with a desert tan -
all four feet of him. Nlxau resolves to
take the ”evil" Coke bottle to the end
of the earth and toss it into oblivion
—— back to the gods.

The one aspect of The Gods Must Be

Crazy which doesn't sit well, though,
is Uys’ treatment of the naive Bush-
men. To him they're "cute"creatures,
and the section of the film which
attempts to explain their culture is
treated with a condescending
unkindness and ignorance.

absurdity, with Uys’ comic timing
registering a solid eight on the Rich-
ter scale. More importantly, though,
this is a film which has a lot to say
about all cultures, all races, all people.
It goes beyond the presumption that

The Smiths: Meat 15 Murder

Off the pedestal and

into the mainstream

MEAT IS MURDER
The Smiths
Sir_e

The sound of The Smiths was
paraded across the Atlantic last
year by an adoring British press

that piled superlatives on the '

band in the way they generally
dispense criticism. To American
ears, the band's wistful music
was pleasant enough, but the
homosexual bravado of lead
singer and lyricist Morrissey
was a bit  unsettling.

Arrogant to the marrow , The
Smiths pressed on with more
singles to keep themselves in
the public eye. Nothing, how-
ever, hinted at what the band
would attempt -— for better and
occasionally worse — with Meat
is Murder, The Smiths’ second
U.S. lp.

Building from its melodic and
engaging predecessor, Meat is
Murder branches out both musi-
cally and lyrically to take on an
appeal more universal than that

of hearing a homosexual come

out of the closet only to prop
himself up‘ on a pedestal.

”That Joke Isn't Funny Any-
more" ends side one with a vivid
illustration of the Smiths’
emerging ability to turn their
pitiable self—indulgence into a
poignant sensitivity. Morris-
sey’s moment of realiiation
regarding his confusion is a
revelation to the listener as
well: I've seen this happen in other
people's lives, and now it's happening
in mine.

Much of the credit for The-
Smiths’ newfound sensitivity
goes to guitarist Johnny Marr,
who has become something of a
British counterpart to R.E.M.’s
Pete Buck. He plays only what
he must but does so with a
shimmering brilliance that sug-
gests a musical walk through an
enchanted forest. Morrissey,
however, deserves applause as
well for staying away (for the
most part) from the whining
sentiments that frequently
tainted The Smiths.

Although Morrissey still

overindulges on occasion (as
when he sings on ”Nowhere
Fast": I'd like to drop my trousers to
the world), far more prevalent are
the luscious moments such as
”How Soon Is Now?" -— a bonus
cut to the U.S. edition and the
title track in which Morrissey
synthesizes the grim imagery
pervading the album: Its death for
no reason and death for no reason is

murder.

We can be thankful that their
first record brought The Smiths
out of the closet and even more
thankful that Meat is Murder has
brought them down off their
pedestal.

balance.

While much of She's The Boss is
for Jagger aficionados’ only, the
record contains enough radio-
accessible material to entice
even the ”pop only” crowd.
Throughout, ]agger’s larger-
than-life persona abounds from
the aforementioned pop cuts to
the title track, in which Mick
takes a tongue—in-cheek swipe
at the growing acceptability of
house husbandship and role
reversal.

Over the last few years of his
ongoing career with The Roll-'
ing Stones and continuing
through the present, the quality
or value of what Mick Jagger
does hasn't been suspect. The
more pertinent question is
whether or not America still
wants Mick at 42. For now at
least, the jury is still out.

Phil Collins
Atlantic Records

Phil Collins’ third record will
add another feather to a cap that
already resembles an Apache
headdress. Using a quiverful of
tried—and-true arrows, this
record will hit home with more
than just a few of its songs.

Phil has used these methods
before. He won't be accused of

QOOQQPHIL COLLINSQQOOOOQOOQQOOOOOOOOQOOQOCOOOOQQOQQO

The success formula incorpo-
rates a couple of elements. The
first has its roots in the '70s.
Propelling Genesis and his
fusion band Brand X, Phil Col-
lins rejected the self-indulgent,
p0wer—thudding flourishes of
those times in favor of a leaner,
more ' subtly expressive style
that used different drum tones
to turn rhythm into melody.

augmented with enough differ-
ent tom-toms to executedrum

face of a microchip.

all been hits: ”The Roof is Leak-
ing,” ”Do You Know, Do You
Care” and, on this record, ”Long
Long Way to Go," helped out on
vocals by Sting.

The other trademark of Phil's
solo records is the crisp, com-
plex horn charts, executed here
by the Phenix Horns. The
album's opener and first British
single, ”Sussudio," is a trium-
phant case in point.

The only flaw of this record,
which otherwise abounds in
angry love songs and Phil's affa-
ble charm, is the first single,
"One More Night." Sounding
like a three-minute rewrite of
”Against All Odds,” this song
casts Phil as a crawling, snivel-
ing twit to some faceless killer-
bitch andhas none of the wry
self—mockery that embellishes
classic torch songs. Must have
been made for MTV, so Phil
could play out that favorite
rock-video staple —— the pathetic
voyeur -- looking through the
blinds at the ex and her new
thing.

Standouts are the social com-
ment ”Doesn’t Anybody Stay
Together Anymore” and the

hymn-like ”Take Me Home," a

seeming sequel to Peter
Gabriel's ”Solsbury Hill," with
PC himself singing some vocals.
This song is really stirring and
should give goosebumps when
Phil tours in May. Buy the
album and forget the single.

BRIGHT LIGHTS, BIG CITY
By Iay Mclnerney
Vintage Contemporaries

Where else but in Manhattan can
one run into the cornucopia of night-
clubs, fashion shows, editorial offi-
ces, parties and controlled substances
that enlivens Bright Lights, Big City.
This is the stomping grounds for
McInerney's youthful hero, who util-
izes a Nick Carraway-like narrative
role sans being named outright.

Aspiring to eventually write and
publish fiction, the hero makes his
living in the factual verification
department of a magazine. Spurned
by his wife, who gains sudden model-
ing fame, his fiction unnoticed and
his boss uncompromising. in her atti-
tude toward him, the hero takes
solace in his evenings out with his
alter ego, Tad Allagash. Allagash is a
Dionysian bent on excessive con-

sumption and party-hopping until

dawn, a lifestyle to which the hero
surrenders unconditionally.

Life in the fast lane — and the pur-
suit of still more a soon catches up

FOOTBALL SHOCK
By Steve Segneff

I. Pohl Associates

Like the athlete who, upon retir-
ing, feels compelled to chronicle his
career, Steve Segneff takes the out-
sider's approach to advance his
thoughts on the inside of the game.
The only thing wrong with that,
given his 1977 stay in the Pitt sports
information department, is that Seg-
neff is still a rookie.

His attempts at parodying the year
2000 —- thoroughly saturated by then
with footballitis —— result in a bunch
of schlock. Football Shock is too short
(62 pages) given the subject, and it's
padded by editorial cartoon-like
drawings that seem to have just been
ripped from some grade school wall.

page 1 1

 

Obviously, Segneff needs more

' than the kindergarten credentials to

his name if he wants to market a
worthwhile sports book, let alone
imitate Art Buchwald. This latest
one, of bone-dry satire, borrows
questionable credence from the
Rocky Bleier and Myron Cope quips
on the front cover. They are not
without their obvious shortcomings,
either.

The few ”good” moments there are
only seem that way because of the
poor writing. Scattered mentions are
made of a Jerry Lewis "Gamblers Tel-
ethon," converting the Grand
Canyon into a colossal stadium, and
scurrying "recruiters who flock to
births of superstars, treating off-
spring like breeders would colts of
multi-money stakes winners."

Almost desperately, the sports
world needs writing on the lighter
side of the game —— the kind Segneff
never accomplished. Drug scandals,
overanalytical media types and
generic autobiographies can disen-
chant readers. Unfortunately, so-has
Segneff.

When words collide

by Leslie M. Bennett

The Danube is certainly bizarre,
unquestionably unorthodox and
quite possibly ineffable. In describing
such a compelling and unusual theat-
rical drama as this award—winning
Pittsburgh premiere, one might find
it a challenge to refrain from likening
its effect to that of hallucinogenic
drugs. Like any expansion of reality,
The Danube is not something easily
communicated. No, you've just got to
experience it.

Herein lies what appears to be one
of playwright Maria Irene Fornes’
intentions: to show the ambiguous
relationship between language and
experience. She created complicated,
if not distorted, images of life and
made them ironic by» employing a
simplistic narrative. The two main
characters canilook and sound as
apple-pie as Barbie and Ken dolls,
before an evil affliction begins to dev-
astate their existence.

The play starts out in Hungary in
1938 when Paul Green, an American
visiting Budapest, falls in love with
Eve Sandor, a thoughtful and ambi-
tious Hungarian. .

The scenes, at first, are only too
familiar. The two meet at a sidewalk
cafe, quickly overcoming cultural and
language barriers. The device of
taped Hungarian-English lessons as
voice—overs is used throughout the

play and adds the dimension of ironic
simplicity.

But as the play continues —— disre-
garding chronological time sequence
— scenes and situations are less rec-
ognizable. It seems that all perspec-
tives are distorted in one way or
another. The scenic backdrops, which
start out to be realistic representa-
tions of the cafe and the city, develop
into abstractions resembling those of
Picasso and Pollack. The set furniture
is tilted and crooked, and becomes
more so toward the end. The charac-
ters are doing strange things. They
wear welding goggles, they spit cof-
fee back into their cups, and between
scenes, they haul around the sets in
robotic motion with fog curling
around their ankles. It’s ridiculously
difficult to figure out what's really
going on, but the intrigue is in trying.

Meanwhile, there are implications
of military takeover and a revolution.
Illness invades everyone.

”She coughs. I throw up. And you
have diarrhea,” says Paul. The sug-
gestion of nuclear catastrophe clearly
lingers in the climax. Yet the simple
phrases of the language lessons con-
tinue. Eve and Paul still attempt to
maintain their Barbie and Ken ritu-
als. In one very odd scene, we see
them with life-size puppets, operat-
ing them from behind.

Technically speaking, The Danube is
a complicated play to produce. With

I“, M».-.r.«.--.

scores of sound tracks, voice-overs,
dozens of pieces of furniture and at
least 15 scene changes, everyone in
the City Theater Company gets a
workout, especially set designer
Tony Ferrieri . Jed Harris’ precisely
coordinated direction is more like
choreography — the stage is in con-
stant motion, and even with the
blinding welding goggles, the actors
move smoothly.

Kelly Maurer, last seen in CTC's
production of The Hypochondriac,
shows a greatdeal of range in her role
as Eve. Curt DeBor as Paul makes his
CTC debut along with Ben Tatar as
Eve's father, and William Cameron in

the remaining roles. All four per-

bizarre.

To make the evening of experi-

short plays by Samuel Beckett prior
to the performance of The Danube.
Catastrophe depicts a director (Bill
Cameron) and stage technician
(Kelly Maurer) putting the final dra-
matic touches on a play, revealing a

theater. Ohio Impromptu, starring Ben
Tatar and Curt DeBor, is a somber,
literary portrait of the relationship
between two seemingly lonely

conference swimming

Friday, March 1, I985 — __Pa86 13

By Mary Daigle
The Pitt News

As expected, the Pitt women’s
swimming and diving team domi-
nated the first day of the Big East
Championships being held this
weekend at Trees Pool. Pitt leads
Syracuse, who is in the No. 2 posi-
tion, by the scoreof 286-169, having
won every event swam in last night’s
finals.

Susan Hickman and Sue Heon
both made qualifying times for the
NCAAs in the 50-yard freestyle and
the 500-yard freestyle, respectively.

“I didn’t know who was more
tired after that race, Sue or I,” said
Pitt head coach David Belowich
after Heon’s 500-yard freestyle. “She
was under a lot of self-induced pres-
sure. She understands, having been
there, what it takes to win. She was
having her doubts as to whether she
could do it again. I think she dis-
pelled those doubts.”

“The first day of this kind of meet
is crucial," said Heon. “Having qual-
ified for nationals, I can relax and
have some fun. I think l’ve got the
confidence back that I might have
been lacking before.”

According to Belowich, Hick-
man, who took first place in addi-
tion to making nationals qualifying
time in the 50-yard freestyle, also has
a good chance of repeatingthat kind
of performance in the 100-yard
freestyle.

“As this meet goes on, I think we

“I’m not really wor-
ried about making
c-uts; I ’m just getting

East championships.

——Susan Hickman

as a team will get faster and more
excited,” said Hickman. ‘‘I’m not
really worried about making cuts,
l’mjust getting anxious to reach our
team goal of three Big East
Championships.”

According to Belowich, the 200-
yard medley relay, consisting of Tra-
cey Pfister, Jodi O’Neil, Cindy Rose
and Susan Hickman, came very
close to making NCAA cuts but
missed them by approximately two
tenths of a second. The relay team
did manage to break the school
record with a time of 1:48:16.

Pfister and O_’Neil took first and
second, respectively, in the 200-yard
individual medley. Pfister againjust
missed making NCAA cuts by just
tenths of a second.

“It's only disappointing when you
don’t quite make one of those times.
It’s only a momentary disappoint-
ment —— winning the race has a more
long-term effect,” said Belowich.

The Pitt divers contributed first-
and third-place scores Wednesday
evening on the three-meter board.
Jennifer Brown placed first with a

total of 424.55 points. Tricia Ney
claimed third with 409.45 points.

“Jennifer is a very talented diver,”
said diving coach Julian'Krug. “I
was afraid that she might not be able
to do as well as she’s done. I try not
to expect them to do that well, but I
knew she could do it.”

Brown said that she had never
placed first at a meet of this caliber.
“I’ve never been in this position
before. I was really excited."

Both Brown and Krug agreed that
the Big East was a good stepping

stone for the divers before they go to
Harvard in two weeks for the NCAA
pre-qualifying meet. “We haven’t
had an I l-dive meet in a while; that
will be good preparation for the pre-
qualifiers,” Brown said.

Belowich feels that the meet has
gotten off to a good start but still has
some fears for the next two days of
competition.

“There may bea tendency for the
team to relax. Now that we’re ahead,
we have to fight that.‘ Now we’re
racing the clock. We have to be men-

It is easy to tell that the University
of Pittsburgh track team is getting
ready for _something big. Just by
watching the team members practice
at Fitzgerald Field House, you can
tell they are preparing for a tough
and exciting challenge.

But why are they working so
hard?

This weekend, members of the
Pitt track team are going to be
among the nation's elite at the Inter-
collegiate Amateur Association of
America Championships to be held
at Princeton. They will go up against
the best collegiate competition in the
East - from North Carolina to
Maine — and as far west as Notre
Dame.

“I expect the guys to do well,"
said head coach John Vasvary.
“That’s what we work toward. We
are good enough to be there. We
have run well enough from the start,
and we are supposed to be there."

This year, Pitt qualified more
runners for the IC4As than in pre-
vious years. There will be I4 Pan-
thers at the championships, and all
of them are ready for the challenge.

cause for the Big East championships.

Competing for the Panthers will be
Gerard Battle, Lee McRae and Rog-
ers Thomas in the 55—meter dash,
Calvin Holmes and Jason Harris in
the 55—meter hurdles, George Ifell in
the long jump, Joe Daniels, Dorrill
Hilliman, Jesse Mikell and Mickey
Rihtarchik in the distance medley
relay, and Scott Abel, Alan Laws,
Tim Manes and Bob Weiner in the
two-mile relay.

McRae, a freshman who won the
55-meters at the Big East Cham-
pionships, could fare well in the
meet, as can Holmes, another fresh-
man. Holmes finished second in the
55-meter hurdles at the Big East
Championships and is looking for
more of the same at the IC4As.

“I am more confident now,’
Holmes stated. “I ran at Princeton
before, and I am familiar with the
surroundings. I hope to do well. I
have learned a lot this year by run-
ning against some of the bigger
names. I_am running against pres-

sure, and I can handle it.”

Another one of Pitt's better pros-
pects is the two-mile relay team.

“If the two-mile relay team can
make it through the first day, then
they have a good chance of doing
well," Vasvary said. “The competi-
tion will be tough, though. Middle
distance running is the main forte of
the East. It is always tough, aggres-

9

tally tough enough to relax. I almost
wish the scoreboard weren’t up there
for them to see,” he said.

According to Belowich, the goals
for the rest of the meet include mak-
ing NCAA cuts in the 200-yard
freestyle relay, the 100-yard free-
style, 200-yard freestyle relay and
Sue Heon’s three remaining events.

“I think she'll [Heon] have a good
meet tomorrow,” Belowich said.
“She stands a good chance for mak-
ing NCAA cuts in all four of her
events."

sive running. We have a young
group, but we have done well lately.”

Included in that young two-mile
relay group is freshman Scott Abel.
A graduate of North Allegheny
High School, Abel had been ham-
pered by a sore left leg but is nearing
100 percent.

“Now that I am healthy, I want to
make up for chances that "I lost,”said
Abel during a recent workout. “I
started out the season running well

and was starting to make a name for
myself. The injury was not what I
hoped would happen. It’s hard com-
ing back when you’ve missed prac-
tice. But, I am really ready to go. We
have a strong relay and we are look-
ing to run well.”

While Abel is a good example of
the young talent the Panthers have,
Mickey Rihtarchik represents the
experience of the team. A graduate
of Mt. Lebanon High School, he is

the only senior on the Panther
squad. He leads the team in stretch-
ing and exercising during workouts,
and the younger Panthers look to
him for instruction and guidance.

“I am a role model for the others
in practice,” Rihtarchik said. “I have
to do things carefully because I am
always being watched. It helps a lot,
though. I have become more con-
scientious of what I am doing. I am
more disciplined now.

Women ready .
for Big East tourney

By Jim Urban

- The Pitt News

The second season begins tonight
for Coach Judy Saurer and the Pitt
women's basketball team in the form
of the Big East tournament at Syra-
cuse University.

The Lady Panthers are seeded
fourth and are coming off ofa three-
point victory over Connecticut last
weekend. Pitt finished at 10-6 in the
Big East, including a loss to Syra-
cuse, whom Pitt faces tonight in the
first round.

Syracuse possesses a big, physical
team led by 6-2 senior Toni Igrec.
lgrec and freshman Felisha Legette
are the heart and soul of the Syra-
cuse offense. They combine for over
20 ppg and 16 rpg, and Saurer
respects their ability. “I picked Syra-
cuse as the preseason favorite to win
the Big East,” said Saurer. “I think
they have the most talent -— and our
teams are comparable in talent."

Should Pitt escape the first round
with a victory, the second-round
matchup with St. John’s would pro-
vide the Lady Panthers with the
opportunity for revenge. Two of
Pitt’s conference losses have come at
the hands of top-seeded St. John’s.
Both, however, may have been
affected by some questionable
officiating.

St. John’s came from behind to
win the regular season champion-

ship, despite the loss of two top play-
ers, Faye Gerald and Barb Rapp,
late in the season.

Coach Joe Mullaney Jr., in his
first year as head coach of the
Express, proved to be a good addi-
tion to the Queens campus, winning
his second regular season champion-
ship in three years. Mullaney guided
Providence to the regular season
crown in 1983.

Right behind St. John’s is Villa-
nova and Coach Harry Peretta. The
Wildcats, the only other team in the
conference to defeat Pitt both times
in conference play, wound up with
the same record as St. John’s, but
lost out in tie-breaking procedures.

Villanova is led by 6-0 forward
Shelly Pennefather, the only other
player in the conference with statis-
tics comparable to Pitt's Jennifer
Bruce. Pennefather averages over 18
ppg and over 10 rpg, and when she
teams with freshman Lisa Angelotti

(l3.l ppg and 6.7 rpg), they form a -

talented front line.

For Pitt, the tournament is a
chance for them to go out and finally
live up to the preseason billings. Pitt
and Villanova were the preseason
favorites to win the conference, but
things never fell entirely into place
for the Lady Panthers. They showed
touches of greatness in wins over
Boston College and Seton Hall, and
even in the loss to Penn State. But
then, the Lady Panthers were mod-
els of inconsistancy in losses to Vil-
lanova and Syracuse, so you can
never tell which team will take the
court.

Meanwhile, Saurer will try to find
a lineup that will click. Heading the
lineup will be senior Jennifer Bruce.
Bruce, who has a shot at being
named‘ the Big East Player of the
Year, will be the object of many de-
fensive schemes aimed at containing
her. -

Joining Bruce at forward will
most likely be senior Ellen Gilhoo-
— ley, and 6-5 Jenny Tyner will play
center. She will attempt to neutralize
players like lgrec and Pennefather.

At the guards, a slew of players
will see action. Junior Kim Tirik will
start at point guard, with Lisa Fubio
most likely at off—guard. Depending
on the situation, Saurer will proba-
bly give playing time to Stephanie
Collins, Kim ‘ Gannis and ‘Valerie
Halesworth.

For Pitt, the tournament cham-
pionship means an automatic
NCAA tournament bid, but even if
they come up short, a good showing
would give Pitt an outside shot at an
at-large bid into the NCAAs.

Wrestlers
at EWL
ﬁnals

By Kirsten Gostony
The Pitt News

Although the Pitt wrestling team
finished its dual-meet season with a
record of 8-7, there are many Pitt
wrestlers who are top contenders in
their weight classes in the Eastern
Wrestling League Championships,
which will take place at Lock Haven.
The tournament will begin at noon
today and continue until tomorrow
evening.

One of Pitt’s top individual
wrestlers is junior John Hnath.
Hnath has compiled a 16-6 record

this season. However, Hnath wres- t

tles in the tough 126-lb. weight class
and is sure to meet stiff competition.

“Hnath is a determined, capable
young man, and I think this is going
to be his weekend,” stated coach
Rande Stottlemyer. “The top two
place winners in each weight class
earn bids to nationals, and we have
high hopes that Hnath will make it.”

Junior Kyle Nellis, who wrestles
at 134 lbs., is also a promising indi-
vidual. He has recorded an impres-
sive 19 wins against four losses.
Stottlemyer said this “will undoubt-
edly be the most exciting weight
class of the tournament, with seven
super contenders. “But I truly
believe that Kyle can be the man of
the hour.” ’

At 21-7, Gary Bolin (142 lbs.) also
has a legitimate shot at being the
EWL champ. Although Bolin has
been wrestling at 150 lbs. during the
season, both he and the coaches
believe it will be most beneficial to

Pitt divers rip
tournament foes

By Laurie Kubli
The Pitt News

The Pitt men’s swimming and
diving team is leading the Big
East championship after one day
of competition at Trees Pool,
topping second-place Villanova
2295-183. The Panthers took
first place in four of five events:
the 500-yard freestyle, the 200-
yard individual medley, the 800-
yard freestyle relay and the
one-meter diving event.

The host team dominated the
one-meter dive, taking the four
top spots. Champ Todd Mulzet,
the 1984 tournament Most Valu-
able Diver, thinks the league is
not tough enough. “This is our
stepping stone," Mulzet said.
“We need to have harder meets
because we’re not in a very com-
petitive conference."

Mulzet said that the team has
trained hard all year but that the
‘true competition comes from
teams lik Penn State and Har-
vard, where the NCAA pre-
qualifiers are being held in two
weeks. “Danny Watson [of Har-
vard] will be there,” Mulzet said.
“lt’ll be tough because he was on
the Olympic team and he’ll be
diving from his own boards."

Jack Shuten (second), Mark
McCormick (third) and Mike
McCully (fourth) round out the

winning quartet. Pitt led l2l.5-
I19 before this event.

Diving coach Julian Krug said
that he is seeing the results ofthe
season’s tough workouts. “Over-
all, I am very pleased but not all
that surprised. They have done a
whale of a job," Krug stated.
“These divers are far and away
the class of the meet. The Big
East has not seen this kind of
diving, but we’ll have to improve
on that to reach our real goal,
which is reaching the NCAAS.”

Don Martin, a member of the
winning 800-yard free relay team
(Greg Murphy, Rick Martin,
and Richard James), said that his
team took nothing for granted in
preparing for this meet. “You
always have to get in and do it.
This is a transition meet,” Martin
said. “Considering we weren’t
really keying on this meet, we did
pretty well.”

Martin added that the team is
looking forward to the Eastern
regionals at Cleveland State,
where Pitt will also compete
against WVU.

“lt’s a good pool -— really well-
lit and really deep. We‘re going
to be shaved [legs] for this meet
in order to get thefeel in the
water,” Martin explained.

The competition continues
tonight at 7 p.m. and tomorrow
at 7 p.m.

drop a weight for the tournament.
“Gary has been on a roll, espe-
cially towards the end of the sea-
son,” said Stottlemyer. “All he has
to do now is believe he can do it.”
Although Greg Zimmerman has
only wrestled seven matches this sea-
son, the trip to the championships
should prove to'be good experience
for this sophomore. Zimmerman is
3-4 this season, and he has a good

chance to be the next Panther to,

make a name for himself.

As a freshman, Doug Haines was
the EWL champion at 150 lbs. and,
as a result,vwas named I981 EWL
Freshman of the Year. However, an
untimely knee injury incapacitated
him in his sophomore and junior
years. Now fully recuperated,
Haines will attempt to gain a cham-
pionship at the 158-lb. weight class.

Freshman Mike Tongel is tenta-
tively scheduled to compete at 167
lbs. Unfortunately, Tongel has
recently been out due to illness, and

the coaches were not sure whether-or
not he would be ready to compete
over the weekend.

Returning to the Panther lineup
after sustaining a knee injury back in
January, freshman Ken Hackman is
prepared to pick up where he left off.
Before his injury, Hackman had
recorded a respectable 10-9 record.

Although all the teams will be
competing for the team title, they are
also working to send individuals to
the NCAA Chamni~*_:I.Lps. “I’m
sure each coach I. concerned about
the team title, but more importantly,
every coach hopes to send as many
qualifiers to nationals as he can,"
said Stottlemyer. “We have a
number of individuals who are top
contenders in their respective
weights, and with the intensity ofthe
tournament and the excitement of
wrestling before a packed house of
screaming fans, we're looking for-
ward to seeing some really good
things coming out of the weekend.”

Cats ﬁght in Big East matchup

By Mark A. Slndler
The Pitt News

As both teams close out their reg-
ular seasons tomorrow at Fitzgerald
Field House, the Panthers and Vil-
lanova appear to be headed for a
mismatch.

The Wildcats (18-8, 9-6) have
already assured themselves a fourth-
place finish in the Big East, possibly
third-place pending Syracuse’s sur-
vival at Georgetown. An 80-75 vic-
tory over Seton Hall two nights ago
was Villanova‘s third win in four
games.

One night earlier the Panthers
(16-10, 7-8) were trounced 80-72, the
Orangemen handing Pitt its third
loss in four games. Will tomorrow’s
2 p.m. game end as a different one
began — the Jan. 29 game? That
night the Wildcats shot a torrid 64
percent at the Palestra to stun Pitt
by the misleading score of 70-63.

Forward Darryl Shepherd insists
not. “We have to stop [forward Ed]

Pinckney,” the junior said yester-
day. “He’s the player that stops the
show. If you stop him, then Pitt will
win. Ed is a very powerful player. If
you let him do what he wants to, we
have no chance to win.”

Indeed, the 6-9 Pinckney canned
15 points one month ago today.
These days he leads_Villanova in
scoring (16.1), rebounding (9.5),
field goal percentage (62.1), blocks
(50) and steals (44). “People say he
and [fonyrd Dwayne] McClain are
first-round draft choices in the
NBA,” said Coach Roy Chipman.

“He's like Charles Smith," Shep-
herd added. “If you let him do what
he wants to, Pitt will win.”

Lately, Smith has been as devas-
tating as Pinckney. Come next
weekend at the Big East tourna-
ment, the only doubt about Smith’s
receiving conference Rookie of the
Year honors is what time the
announcement will be made. He’s
led Chipman’s attack in 12 of 26
games played, and is still perched
atop the pyramids for scoring(l5.2),
rebounding (8.2) and blocks (54).

country," Chipman commented,
“I'm not saying he’s the best, but he’s
definitely had the biggest impact. As
far as being a leader, I never
expected that [of him]."

For the third straight game, Smith
will be the crutch helping the Pan-
thers limp through their final-game.
Ever since shufﬂing a previously bal-
anced starting lineup last weekend,
Chipman will again go with changed
starters. Joining Smith, the only
untouchable, will be Shepherd
(third straight start) and Joey David
at point guard. Demetreus Gore will
likely join David in the backcourt.
Andre Williams appears set at cen-
ter, a position not very crucial given
the absence of production from that
spot all season. “The only position
up for grabs is the center spot,"
Chipman said yesterday.

Villanova coach Rollie Massi-
mino, who yesterday imposed a gag
order to protect his players from
what he deemed an oversaturation

of media attention, doesn’t v
such worries. His three-fo

lineupincludes not only Pinc ey
but senior McClain (14.8 and 58.4

from the field) and Harold Pressley
(12.7). The backcourt is in the hands
of senior Gary McLain, who will
play his last regular season game
with the two notables he first entered
with in 1981.

Said Pinckney earlier in the week:
“It's so different being a senior. Last
year all of a sudden everyone looked
to Gary, Dwayne and me to provide
leadership. Sometimes we didn‘t
know how to handle it. But l’ve
learned that leadership is something
that comes with time.”

His patience has been invaluable.
The Wildcats could seemingly go no
higher than heaven before confer-
ence play. The three seniors prom-
ised to be that good. And they have
been, but the ’Cats finished a disap-
pointing 1-5 against the teams to
beat: Georgetown, St. John’s and
Syracuse.

Redemption might come next
Thursday at 9 p.m. if Syracuse loses
later tomorrow. That’s the time Pitt
plays its first-round game against
the Syracuse-Villanova coin ﬂip
loser. If the Orangemen pull off the
unlikely tomorrow at the Capital

Centre, Commissioner Dave Gavitt
can leave his spare change in his
pocket.

“I don’t like playing [Villanova]
back-to-back, particularly if we beat

‘them [tomorrow]," Chipman said.

“The kids get overconfident. I'm not
saying it’s better or worse because
it‘s the same for both teams. What’s
important now is that we win as
many games as possible.”

“I would like to play Syracuse,’
Shepherd said. “I know for sure we
could beat them. We made some
stupid errors [Tuesday], though I
might have a different opinion after
playing Villanova.”

A soldout crowd will likely inﬂu-
ence Shepherd‘s final decision.

OFF THE BOARDS: Tomorrow
marks Pitt’s sixth sellout at home
this season, the fifth at Fitzgerald.
School re ords have already been set
for average home (6,082) and aver-
age Big East home (7,474) games.

Ever since he was inserted into the
lineup, Shepherd has been the most
productive ex-reserve. From 14 min-
utes per game, he’s now averaged 35
in the last two contests and has been
the second leading scorer in three of
the last four games.

“This is the first time since high
school that I’m playing till I’m
tired,” the 1982 transfer from
Duquesne said.
