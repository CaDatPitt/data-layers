Pitt considers
Spanish minor

Pitt sophomore Utsav Bansal is an
aspiring doctor and neuroscience major
juggling a full courseload,  late-

Spanish

“ItakeSpanishclasses becauseit’s a
reallygreatlanguage to know especially

In  book, released in 2007,’

Abunimah proposes a democratic one-

David Streeter, president of ‘the

that he understands why some people.

might  that Abunimah’s visit
would be controversial, considering

his history with the Electronic Inti-

A./k Clearly it depends who you

ask. Hamas is undeniably a major polit- .

segment of Palestinian society under
occupation  I’m aware, of course, that
other people attach their own labels to
it,  the US. and Israel, which
 it solely as what they call a ter-
rorist organization I don’t ﬁnd those
labels very descriptive because if you
look at exactly the same kind of ac-

don’t describe it as terrorism. Those

aren’t descriptive labels, they’re political
labels -

been to deny that the Palestinians were
living there or were forcibly removed.

Racism spurs

health problems

by Becky Reiser
Staﬂ Writer

A visiting professor from the
University of Washington con-
ducted a study that found that

U.S.-born Latino and Asian peo- .

ple suffer more’ discrimination
and mental health issues than
Latino and Asian immigrants.
David T. Takeuchi, professor
of sociology and associate dean
of research at the University" of
Washington, spoke yesterday as
part of the Reed Smith lecture
series in the Center for [Race

and Social Problems within the -

School of Social Work. About

40 people attended the lecture in A

V courtesy

included Cubans, Mexicans and
Puerto Ricans, among other La-
tinos. The Asian-American pool
included, Chinese, Vietnamese
and Filipino participants, along

Vvith other Asians.

Discrimination was measured
by factors such as the levels of
individuals received,
poor service at restaurants and
how others viewed the differ-
ent ethnic groups. For example,
some thought the ethnic groups
were dishonest, “not as smart”
and generally not as “good.”

Takeuchi said. that partici-
pants in thestudy who were im-
migrants were more likely to be-

the Cathedral of Learning. lieve the discrimination was about

Takeuchi’s lecture, titled their races and accents, whereas

“The results were consistent

While plans. for the potential Spanish minor

Catys Evans-Conales; dhmr of languages at

“I ﬁnd that it’s very beneﬁcial to students,” she

Council votes to pass a new ordinance,

punishable by a daily ﬁne between
$200 and $5500. -

Similarly, if a job wasn’t done right, no
one would hesitate to dismantle someone
else’s work and do it again, only better. This
is how I developed the term “negative out-

been produced if no one was working on
the job at all than if. I was working on it.

I got to use this term to describe my work '

more than once. For me, it wasn’t unusual
to have a hammer in one hand and a claw to
remove nails in the other.

_ To the Editor,

I would like to apologize to all fans of the “King Jember” comic [that ran last Thursday] A

in regard to the strike declared just before spring break. Science is Dead was indeed billed
to perform the Live Show on Feb. 11, but the band had to cancel, as two of the members
had a class at the time of the performance. I did not mean any disrespect to Science is
Dead by hostinganother band in the "spot that they gave up, but I sincerely apologize to
anyone deeply affectedby this schedule change. For those of you upset over this situation,
you can get your fix of Science is Dead on April .10. . ‘

ROGER HUMPHRIES AND THE
RH FACroR

Tuesday, 5 p.m.
Free
Backstage Bar at Theater
Square, Downtown

For Pittsburgh jazz legend
Roger Humphries, music is more
than a hobby or even a career.

“It’s been a way of "life for me,”
said Humphries.

That’s not an exaggeration.
The Pittsburgh native found his
passion in life a tad bit earlier
than most -—- he began beating

on things before he’d been alive a A

half decade, and he’s been doing
it ever since. '

Rendering an even more ador-
able and incredible image is a
4-year-old Humphries sitting in
with the Tab Smith Big Band,
a popular ensemble in the late
1940s

,When the band came to Pitts-
burgh, Humphries’ uncle men-
tioned his little nephew’s talent on
the drums, and the band insisted
he come and play with them.

“It was amazing for people
— at the age of 4 and a half
this kid standing there ‘playing
drums almost as big as he is,” said
Humphries.

Humphries - started playing
professionally at 14 years old and
led his first ensemble at Carnegie
Music Hall when most people
learn to drive, at 16.

Always being surroundediby
older musicians, Humphries was
able to pick up on somethings
from those who had been playing
longer.

“If you’re cool enough and

its  
If you're cool enough and

you're respected enough, you
can learn a lot from older

musicians.
Roger .  
Hurnphries

you’re respectful enough, you can
learn a lot from older musicians,”
said Humphries. -

As soonias he graduated high
school, Humphries began playing
with Stanley Turrentine.

Local jazz legend contemplates his Career

He then went on to play with
the Horace Silver. Quintet, with
whom he had the pleasure of
touring through Europe twice.

“It was amazing then [to think
of where you grew up at, and
you’re going all over the world with
yourtalent,” said Humphries.

With that talent .-he landed I

himself a job in the mid-1960s
with Ray Charles — a position
that took Humphries all over the

United States and Europe, per-‘
forming at the Coconut Grove

in Los Angeles and the Newport
Jazz Festival.

Eventually, he made ‘an impor-
tant decision that, today, he views
as one of his best.

“One of .the great decisions
that I made was coming off the
road and being with my wife and
family, my kids. That’s one of the
best decisions I ever made be-
cause you can’t go "back and relive

it. So if I didn’t do what I did by ‘ I

coming home, I couldn’t have
had the opportunity of sharing
my life with my children,” said
Humphries. '

In 1972, Humphries decided ,

to start his own band, RH Factor.

“I worked for everybody else, worked
for a lot of people. There comes a time
where you want to play tunes that you want
to play, so when you’re the leader you can
pick those songs,” said Humphries.

The players have changed over the years,
but the current members are Lou Stellute
on tenor saxophone, Dwayne Dolphin on
bass, Max Leake on keyboards and Jamie
Moore on trumpet. _

The RH Factor plays every Thursday
night at C]’s Lounge. '

A wide array of legendary Pittsburgh
jazz players and jazz artists from all over the

country come for the jam session.

“Pittsburgh is one of my favorites.
The audience -is a great audience,” said
Humphries.

The drummer eventually got into teach-
ing through his friend Dr. Harry Clark.

. Though he never went to college and

doesn’t hold a degree, he uses his experi-

ence as a way to teach students.

"Teaching is sharing your life with
someone. But I didn’t know that at first. I‘
was petriﬁed and I was like ‘What am I go-
ing to teach the kids?’ and [Clark] politely
came and said, ‘Teach them what you know,
they don’t know what you know,’” said

, Humphries. .

Humphries has done a lot in his career,
from playing professionally to touring to
starting his own group to teaching.

“To tell you the truth, surprisingly, at my
age now I’m very happy with the decisions
that I made. Fortunately, I have no regrets,”
said Humphries. if

He plans to continue his musical jour-
ney.

“To _me, it’s something until the day you
die, you’re always striving to get better with
what you do. There are still things I’m reach-
ing for musically,” said Humphries. “I’m
blessed to have my cake and eat it, too.”

The Mitsch Report

Pitt owns the talent to make a long tournament run

 
   

by Pat Mitsch
Senior Stzzﬁ’ Writer

Turns out Pitt’s 2009 Big East
tournament stay wasn’t completely
useless.

Pitt’s courteous bow to West Vir-
ginia in the quarterﬁnals last Thurs-
day at Madison Square Garden was
ugly enough to sting the eyes and
incite irritation in many, but at least
it means there won’t be any excuses
for Pitt in this year’s NCAA Tourna-
ment.

Everything is in place: Pitt’s a
No. 1 seed. The team has stayed
relatively healthy. And the rested
players should be plenty motivated
to rough up the best and worst the
East region can offer.

If all goes as it should, Pitt will
make the Final Four, maybe even
win the school’s first national cham-
pionship since the start of the Great
Depression.

If not, and the Panthers slide
easily out of the ﬁeld yet again,
there’s nothing to blame but the

team itself.

If Pitt doesn’t make the Final
Four — anything less ‘for a two-
time No. 1 with two All—Americans
would be a failure — it’s because Pitt
choked. '

End of discussion.

Granted, Pitt hasn’t made it past
the Sweet 16 despite making the
NCAA Tournament each of the last
seven seasons. And there have been
some epic stumbles during those
years. But, simply put, none of those
teams had the talent like this year’s,
with two solid NBA prospects and
a point guard destined to be a pro
somewhere.

Carl Krauser won’t shoot 20
times per game on this team. Dwy—
ane Wade won’t singlehandedly beat
this team. Patrick O’Bryant won’t

‘push around Dejuan Blair, and

Antonio Gates w'on’t out—duel Sam
Young.

Now, these guys were all here last
year, and Pitt still slumped out of i the
Tournament in the second round.

The excuses:

playing nowhere near his ability
when he came back from a debilitat-
ing foot  the same one that’s
costing Marquette guard Dominic
James the two biggest months of
his life. Mike Cook was out. Pitt was
banged up.

Aside from minor injuries this
year, Pitt is at full strength.

2. Fatigue. Here’s where the loss
to West Virginia becomes impor-
tant. ’

Pitt lugged its No. 7 seed through
four straight wins in the 2008 Big
East tournament to eventually win
the championship and suddenly be-
came the hot pick to win the whole
thing, especially when Bob Knight
chose the Panthers to do so.

Unfortunately for Knight,
though, the Panthers embarrassed
him perhaps more than they did
themselves when they decided they
only wished to play through two
rounds and lost to Michigan State.

Suddenly, then, the reason Pitt
looked so strong coming out of the
Big East‘ tournament was why the

team appeared weak after only one

Florida trip a success with

six wins in eight games

by Sergei Feldman
Staﬂ Writer

Florida is among the common hot spots
for spring break, but for the Pitt baseball
team, it was a spot for competition.

This past week, Pitt entered the Papa
]ohn’s Classic hoping to wipe away the
memories from a 1-3 start to its season.

Six victories later, the mission was ac-
complished.

After_a 6-2 record at the Papa ]ohn’s
Classic, Pitt improved its record to 7-5
on the season, a resurgence that could
propel the Panthers to a successful mid-
season run. .

Pitt plays eight of its next nine games in
a two-week span at home at familiar Trees
Field. .

Highlighting the Papa John’s, Classic
was Pitt’s performance in the tournament’s
opener against St. Bonaventure. The game
needed extra innings before coming to a
close, and Pitt prevailed 12-8 in 11 innings.

Third baseman Joe Leonard went a
strong 4 for 6 and drove in three runs to

‘lead the way for Pitt.

‘ The Panthers controlled most of the
game, but an eighth-inning collapse nearly
proved costly, as St. Bonaventure rallied for
ﬁve runs and took an 8-7 lead.

After a ninth-inning Pitt run tied the
score, the Panthers took the momentum
into extra innings, as Pitt stormed with

four 11th-inning runs and -sealed itself a
victory. 4 _

Showing signs of invincibility, Pitt won
its next three games as well, before falling
to Miami 11-6 in the only contest that did
not fall under the Papa John’s Classic. Then
came the lopsided defeat to the Ohio State
Buckeyes.

The Buckeyes ﬁred off 20 runs against

ii the Panthers and won 20-3.

After taking an early 2-0 lead, Pitt col-
lapsed. Despite striking out six Ohio State
batters, pitcher Nate Reed gave up seven
runs, five of which were earned, on nine
Ohio State hits. Reed’s day was cut short

‘after '5 l /3‘ innings of competition.

The brightspot against the Buckeyes

for Pitt was the play of junior inﬁelder,

Chris Sedon.
He went 3 for 4 with an RBI and two
runs scored. After 10 games, Sedon is bat-

’ ting .465 (20 for 43) and leads the team in

slugging percentage at .744.

Pitt brushed off the loss with another
winning streak, defeating Long Island and
North Dakota State in a doubleheader.

The Panthers look to continue their hot
streak at Youngstown State this afternoon
at 3 p.m. The team then picks up with its
first Big East games of the season with a
three-game series this weekend at Trees
Field against Cincinnati. '

No excuses remain for Pitt

round played in the NCAAS. The Panthers
played four games in four days, after 2]], against
tough opponents during the Big East title run.
They had to be tired from that, right? Maybe
if they hadn’t expended so much energy inside
the Garden then they wouldn’t have struggled

_ so much against  State.

So this year, when Pitt appeared. destined to
be a sturdy national championship. candidate
after going 28-3 in the regular season, many in

_ and around Pitt, hoops felt that the Panthers

might want to focus a little bit more on 
a run  the NCAA Tournament than in the
Big East tournarncnt

__ In hindsight it appeared as if Pitt didn’t fo-
cus at all on the Big East tournament,’ which
I’m sure isn’t true. But with a No. 1 seed in the

I NCAA Tournament all but guaranteed, Pitt

walked off the court at the Garden as leisurely

as  a stroll through Central Park.

ther.
“As hard as it is to say, I’d rather lose in the
Big East than in the NCAA,” said Pitt center
Dejuan Blair. _ —
\Well, they lost pretty quickly in the Big East

tournament. Now all the Panthers will get the _

chance to rest up for the NCAA Tournament.
All the ‘focus has been directed toward this.
They should be at their best — the best a Pitt
basketball team has probably ever been. That
means not only making it past the Sweet 16,
but to the Final Four, maybe even to the title
game. ’ ’
Referees get paid to call games evenly. Inju-

ties arealways a "risk.
If the-Panthers bow out early yet  this ‘

year it’s all on them.

There was no mistake after the game, ei- .
