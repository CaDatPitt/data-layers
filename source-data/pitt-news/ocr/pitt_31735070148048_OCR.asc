Pitt students to remain in Japan

Amy Friedenberger
Senior Staﬁ” Writer

Junior Olivia Vareha was on the
ninth ﬂoor of a building in Kyoto
Station taking a kimono. class last
Friday morning when the earth-
quake struckjapan.

She felt the entire ﬂoor sway-
ing back and forth and described
the movement like being on a boat
at sea.

“At ﬁrst I thought I was getting
sick,” Vareha said through Skype.
“There are times I don’t feel well

and I have to sit down, but then
I realized it was an actual earth-
quake.”

But it has been business as usual
in Kyoto since the earthquake and

tsunami struck more than 100 .

miles away, off _]apan’s northeast-
ern coast.

“Everyone is going to work,
students are commuting to school
and people are still going out on
the town,” Vareha said. “It feels
like nothing has really changed
here.”

Vareha and the other six Pitt stu-
dents currently studying abroad in

imagine

Japan have been mostly unaffected

by the 8.9-magnitude earthquake.
and ensuing tsunami that struck ,

the country more than 100 miles
away from their location.

Jeff Whitehead, director of the
Study Abroad Office, said that six
of the students are prepared to
depart Japan as scheduled in late
March or early April, which is the
beginning of the traditional spring
semester injapan. One will remain
for the conclusion of a year-long
study abroad program.

The closest Pitt study abroad

location to the area affected by

the earthquake and tsunami is
Tokyo. '
Whitehead said" that the pro-
gram in Tokyo pushed back the
ﬁrst week of the spring semester by
one week, missing the earthquake.

The other programs plan to con-

tinue normally because they are
not in the region severely affected
by the earthquake and resulting
tsunami: ‘

I Vareha lives in Kyoto and is
studying at Ritsumeikan Univer-
sity. She intends to stay injapan as

-long as the area is still considered"

Gov. Tom Corbett’s proposed’

cuts to education have garnered
opposition from legislators on
both sides of the aisle and people
across the state. '

The cuts, part of the Repub-
lican governor’s ﬁrst budget,
amount to almost $900. mil-
lion in education spending and
would reduce Pitt’s $185 million
appropriation by more than half,
to $80.2 million. State legisla-
tors will hold hearings on the
budget throughout this month
and April before setting a date
to vote on it. _

and the 14 state-run universi-
ties in Pennsylvania would have
their appropriations cut by half
as well. '
University officials across the
state have not said how much of
an effect these cuts could have on
tuition. Chancellor Mark Nor-
denberg at a press conference
last week said that the Univer-
sity would try to keep increases
within “manageable levels.”

Pitt senior Micah Toll holds one of his inventions: a lightweight construction beam made out of a material created by plastic-stressed skin and foam.

Gretchen Andersen
Staff Writer

When Micah Toll saw images of Afghani refu-
gees living in tents and subpar housing dur-
ing the beginning of the war in Afghanistan,
he wished he could do something for them.

And then he did. ‘

Toll, who is currently a senior mechani-
cal engineering student, was only 17 when
he started Disaster Rebuilding Solutions,
a research and development company. Toll
said he had to have his father sign the com-

_pany forms with him because he was still

a minor.

The company markets one of Toll’s many
inventions -— a lightweight construction
beam made out of a material created by
plastic-stressed skin and foam.

Although the material is easy to cut and
transport, it can be used to build temporary
bridges and housing structures.

“My ultimate goal is to really see [Design

Rebuilding Solutions] brought to the market-
place and see it used for what it’s intended
for, to help see it save millions of peoples’
lives,” he said. , « .

Toll says he is just like any other college
student — he has a messy room, goes to class
and is involved with student organizations
such as Hillel, Panthers for Israel and Pitts-
burgh Israel Public Affairs Committee. Toll
also serves on the Committee for Accuracy
in Middle East Reporting in America as the
Pitt campus fellow this year, while at the same
time pursuing his engineering endeavors.

But Toll also has several companies,
patent—pending inventions and a feature on
“The Circuit,” a YouTube channel presented
by the U.S. Air Force.

One of his most recent accolades came

from Chancellor Mark Nordenberg, who

highlighted Toll’s achievements in the Board
of Trustees meeting at the end of February.

Nordenberg played the clip from “The
Circuit” and said it was a dramatic and in-
formative way to show the Trustees how Mi-

cah has used his Pitt education to develop a
‘number of inventions. _
“Micah Toll’s story is a perfect example
of a Pitt student combining the educational,
research and public service aspects of his
time here at Pitt,” he said in an e-mail sent
from University spokesmanjohn Fedele.
Eric Beckman, George M. Bevier profes-
sor of engineering and co-director of the

Mascaro Sustainability Initiative, said he‘

has known Toll since he won his ﬁrst contest
through the Mascaro Center. Beckman said
he usually doesn’t meet students at Pitt with
such a strong entrepreneurial drive at so
young an age.

“He’s chosen to direct his energies at novel
solutions to ‘green’ problems, where he shows
good business intuition along with technical

» skills,” Beckman said. “If Pitt could graduate
, about 20 Micahs per year, the region would
have no worries about business creation and ‘

job growth for decades to come.”
Professor Howard'Kuhn, in the depart-

ment of mechanical engineering and mate-

rials science, has known Toll since the stu-
dent’s freshman year, teaching him in classes
such as Entrepreneurship for Engineers and

Product Realization. I-Ievsaid that Toll uses his '

engineering expertise to meet societal needs
through his entrepreneurial work.

In class, Toll is “quiet and unassuming,
but he is diligent and tenacious in pursuing
correct answers to homework problems and
conclusions to projects,” Kuhn said.

Kuhn said that Toll is neither the best nor
the worst student in the class. “The major
difference is that he is constantly thinking up
ideas" for applications of his new knowledge
to solve larger societal problems and acting
on those ideas by building prototypes to test
the ideas and then building a business model
to implement those ideas.”

For each project, company or contest, Toll

' said, he. has worked with different people

because he knows what his skills are and what
they aren’t, so he tries to work with people
who have complementary expertise. _

[Some GOP disagree
with Corbett

Budget < 1

Wednesday, a number of legislators said
that Corbett’s proposed cuts would go too
far. Also, _the majority of Pennsylvanians

1 said that they would oppose the education

funding cuts, according to a poll released

yesterday by Franklin 8: Marshall College A

in Lancaster, Pa.
After chairing the Appropriations

Jim.Fe1'lo:

the higher education cuts to hold universi-
ties accountable for tuition increases.
He said that these hearings are the
beginning of the budget process, and
Corbett has been open to changes in his
budget. Corman said that Corbett might
have even done students a favor by pro-
posing such deep cuts because it raised

His pledge of no new” taxes is
disingenuous because the cuts 1

in higher education and to local

school districts will mean higher  

tuition costs and higher property

taxes .  

Committee‘ hearing, State Sen. Jake Cor-
man, R- Centre, said legislators would try
to roll back some of the proposed cuts,
although Pitt’s appropriation would likely
still take a hit this year.

“The past few days have shown that
there is .a lot of support for higher ed-
ucation. We’re going to do our best to
minimize the cuts that were proposed,”
he said.

State Sen.Jim Ferlo, D-Allegheny, who
is the committee’s minority vice chair,
took a stronger stance against the cuts.

He and many other Democrats have op-.

posed the appropriation cuts since their
introduction last week.

After the hearing, Ferlo released a
statement on his website and through
the state Democratic party.

“His pledge of no new taxes is disin-
genuous because the cuts in higher educa-
tion and_ to local school. districts will mean
higher tuition costs and higher property
taxes,” he said in the statement. .

University ofﬁcials did not immedi-
ately respond to requestsfor comment.

Corbett called the $27.3 billion, 1,100-

page proposal a “reality—based budget”

when he proposed itilast Tuesday. It in-
cludes no tax increases —— in line with
his campaign promises -—-— and cuts state
spending to 2008 levels. ‘

The recently elected governor wanted

'-  ..,. .-A. - .- -

their proﬁle in the public dialogue.

“This elevated higher education toa lot
higher level,” he said. “[There are] a lot_
more people talking about higher educa-
tion now than they would otherwise.”

G. Terry Madonna, the director of the
Center for Politics and Public Affairs at
Franklin 8: Marshall, who helped conduct
the poll, said that higher education spend-
ing has become one of the largest issues
in the state.

The potential budget cut “does affect
people more directly, but I don’t think

.it’s pushed off the tablethe debate over

Marcellus Shale,” he said. “It’s not the
dominant issue the way it was before.”

In the poll, about two—thirds of re-
spondents opposed the higher education
cuts in some way, and 28 percent favored
them. 4

Respondents favored proposed cuts to
local school districts less; 19 percent of
them supported those cuts, whereas 68
percent opposed them. '

Madonna said that he has heard of
some support for higher education in the -

' legislature, but even if the legislature gets’ ,

money back to the universities, it will still
be a difficult process.

“They want to get some funding back,
say $500 million,” he said about the pro-
posed $900 millioncuts. “Where are they
going to come up with $500'mi1lion?”.

to be safe.

Vareha said her mother, on the
other hand, wants her to leave, but
her father has been calm and trusts
the Pitt student’s judgment.

Even though Vareha lives away
from the affected areas, she still ex-
perienced the immediate impact.

Vareha’s boyfriend, Pitt alum-
nus Harold Baguinon, lives in
Shikama, Japan. Located in the
northeast, Shikama was a vulner-
able location when the earthquake
struck.

He was teaching English to V

Japanese students through the
UKJapan Exchange and Teaching
Programme. ,

“For me, it really hit home be—
cause my boyfriend was up north
and almost near the heart of the
entire disaster,” Vareha said. “I
think of Hurricane Katrina, and
because I was so far away, it never
reallyvhit me.”

Vareha had difficulty calling
him, but saw at the train station
that he wouldn’t be able to take any
trains out of Shikama. Eventually,
she was able to get in touch with
him and ﬁnd out if he was safe.

“But then I couldn’t reach him
for two days, so it was extremely
nerve-wracking,” Vereha said.

After the phone companies
were able to repair signals, Bagui-
non organized to travel to Kyoto,

. where he arrived two days ago.

Senior Josie Norton, who is
studying at Kobe University, was

. not in Japan when the earthquake

hit. She was ﬂying back to Japan
from Australia, where she has fam-
ily members.

The plane stopped over in
Guam because of the earthquake,
about halfway between Japan and
Australia. After the plane arrived
inJapan, she had to spend several
hours at a train station in Narita,
Japan, before the trains were run-
ning again. '

- Norton plans to remain inJapan
for heryear-long study abroad pro-
gram because Kobe is considered
safe and the people are calm.

“If people started to panic, peo-
ple started coming down south and
bigger problems occurred, I would
probably leave,” Norton said. '

Even though the students are

studying in the southern region
of Japan, their daily life has been
affected.

Both Vareha and'Norton have
experienced the planned black-
outs, which are meant to conserve
power as a result of the crippled
nuclear reactors.

“Some businesses in Kyoto
aren’t forced to shut off their
power, but they do it anyway,”
Vareha said.

Vareha said that people have
been buying all of the bottled water
in Kyoto, and she said a friend in
Tokyo told her that the shelves are
almost bare. Norton said that food
like bread is quickly disappearing
off the shelves. - 1

Vareha said that students pre-
paring to come to Japan should
probably discuss with family
whether or not to go because of
the problems inJapan.

Norton said that students
should not let the possibility of

1 natural disasters affect their deci-

sion to study abroad.

“Students should still come to
Japan to study abroad,” Norton
said.  v

device with Adam Tow, a friend he met at
summer camp about seven years ago.

Although they cannot talk much about the
project because it’s patent—pending, both Tow
and Toll said they hope to bring thevdevice
to the market by the year’s end. Toll said
because he knew the engineering and Tow
knew the biomechanics behind the design,
the two were able to work together well.

“Anyone who knows Micah is struck by
his passion for the things he cares about
— from engineering to social justice,” Tow
said. “The added perspective I can give as
someone who’s worked with Micah before
is that he’s uniquely patient and easy to in-
teract with — a skill which I’m sure will take
him places.” ’

That’s cheesy
The Associated Press re-
ports that a Polish restau-

‘ rant has commemorated the.

supposed peccadilloes of the
embattled prime minister of
Italy, Silvio Berlusconi, in a
new menu item. Inspired by
the ongoing media storm sur-
rounding Berlusc0ni’s alleged
associations with younger
women and prostitutes, the
Warsaw pizzeria A Modo Mio
created a “bunga bunga” piz-
za. According to the article,
the flavor is enhanced by figs
and black pepper, “words with
sexual connotations in Italian
and Polish slang.” In the spirit
of dedicating pizzas to politi-
cians, The Pitt News would
like to announce the unveiling
of the “Corbett Pizza.” Special
offer for Pennsylvania college
students: Order a large pizza,
receive half the pie for twice
the price!

Penetrating new markets
In marketing, if you can
somehow link a product to
sex, you’re bound to do well,
right? That seems to be the
running idea at Graphic Ar-
mor Inc., which according to
the Associated Press is put-
ting the “sex sells” maxim to
the most literal of tests. The
company is rolling out a new
brand of condoms, “Picture
Condoms,” that feature full-
color images on the actual
latex. Not only do they meet
FDA standards, but the first
round ofthe condoms are em-
blazoned with Kiss member
Gene Simmons’ tongue. Since
the White House is trying to
rekindle its relations with

young voters in the run-up
to the 2012 election, perhaps
“Picture Condoms” will give
the Obama campaign a cre-
ative way to have its message
reach young voters.

California gators, we’re un-
reliable
According to the KTLA

News, California police found

2,300 marijuana plants grow-
ing in an East Hemet, Calif.,
home, last week —— but that’s
sort of boring. The fun part is
that the dope was protected
by an unusual body guard: a
4-foot-long alligator named
Wally. But if the normal be-
havior of alligators — lying
utterly prostrate all the time,
basking in warm waters and
snapping occasionally — is
any indication, we’re betting
the alligator, described as a
“watchgator” in the article,
got into the dope stash.

Are you awake? Take our

The Examiner.com reports
that a study at Colorado Col-
lege has found that college
students —— get this — don’t
get as much sleep as they
should. Six in 10 respondents
said they get an inconsistent
amount of sleep per night,
with 70 percent saying they
receive less than seven hours.
Instead of spending money on
studies that conclude what we
already know too well, per-
haps the research funds could
have been better used paying

THAT’S WHAT SHE SAID

Needles and ink: Making th
most of your skin

Caitlyn Christensen
Columnist

On one of the few sunny days Pitts-
burgh managed to muster last week,
my roommate and I trekked out to
Shadyside for her ﬁrst tattoo.

In the past, the college crowd
didn’t really indulge in tattoos, but
as many of you already lmow, they
are growing ever more popular in all
kinds of social circles. Theyaren’tjust
a hipster thing, either. But no matter
the social context, I don’t think tat-
toos are somethingto be takenlightly.
As far as I cantell, a lot of people toy
with the idea but hesitate to go all the
way with it, or they get something
spontaneously, on a lazy afcemoon.
If you’re considering a tattoo, here
are a few tips:

First, make sure it’s something
that you really want. Don’t get it for
the novelty, because eventually itwill
stop being new. If the design is good,
it will always look appealing — but
don’t do it just to get attention. Buy a
new shirt or something. By no means
should you do it to boost your self-
conﬁdence, either; again, if you’re

bored withyour appearance, go shop-
ping or get a haircut. A good rule of
thumb is towait six months from the
time you come up with the design to
when you make the appointment. If
you’re having doubts about it after six
months, don’t go through with it. It’s
not worth spending the rest of your
life second—guessing a decision.
Make it unique, meaningful or at
least aesthetically appealing. Atattoo
says a lot about you. A tribal sleeve
tattoo, for instance, implies that we
probablywouldn’t get along that well.
Getting the word “Fancy” tattooed
in cursive script on your forearm
probably makes you anything but.
I do believe that a person should be
judged by the content ofher character
and not her appearance, but a tattoo
manages to meld a little bit of both
those aspects of a person forthe public
eye to scrutinize. Think it out, and
be practical —— unless you want your
tattoo to say that you aren’t. Inwhich
case go all out, Mike 'I‘yson-style.
Ifyou’ve thought about it, settled

onadesignyou’ll like forever-—-or at 1.

least thatwill remind you of atime you
thought you would like it forever —
and made ittothe tattoo parloratlast,

there are a few more things you need
to know. First of all, don’t freak out.
Anyone who’s been in a shop knows
that the sound of that high-pitched
needle in the background sends out
primal chills that make you want to
ﬂee. The important thing to remem-
ber is how longyou’ve wanted the tat-
too and how excited you were to get
it —— and how good you’ll feel about it
once the needle’s out of earshot.

Be assertive, but listen to the tat-
too artist. A good artistwillbe ableto

tell you whether she thinks the tat- ‘
too needs to be enlarged to show off .
some of the nuances of the design, 

for instance. However, don’t be afraid
to speak up if you think it’s too large
or if you see something in the design
that you don’t like. A redesign might
be a little inconvenient, but it’s more
inconvenientto have a messed—up re-
minder for the rest of your life. And
when it comes to placing the tattoo,
take time to ensure that it’s exactly
where you want it. Now is not really
the time to be accommodating. You
can always make up for your needi-

ness and indecision with a nice tip.
Once you’re shaved, stenciled and

greased-up with Vaseline, try and re-
lax. Painvaries dependingon personal
tolerance and the body part you’re
getting tatted up, but as far as I can
tell, the needle isn’t a torture device.
Experience says that it produces a dull
discomfort —— not enjoyable, but not
screams-of-agonystatus. Focus. Don’t,
for instance, let your friend makeyou
laugh. Ifyou do twitch, don’t panic-
a good artistwillbe able to thickenup
a slightly wobbly line so you aren’t
off-kilter. I . A I _
Onceallissaid and done comes the
most important step of all: Take care

ofyourtattoo. Don’tignoretheart1'st’s T

instructions. Treat it Well. You didn’t
pay all of that money for a jacked-
up piece of body art, and if a tattoo
is damaged because of negligence,
touch-ups won’t be free. So bring on
the unscented vitamin E-enriched 10-
tion and applythat stuff at leasttvvice a
day, or whenever the spot is itchy.

I think when treated well, tattoos
can be really beautiful —— away to cel-
ebrate youryoung, healthy body while
it still looks that way. It’s a matter of
preference, but I’d say the best way
to start off on your tattooing adven-
ture is to get one that’s in a hidden or
slightly hidden spot. No matterwhere
you end up getting it, it will be weird
at ﬁrst ——- you might even forget you
have one until you look in the mirror.

As long as you were conﬁdent and .

thoughtful — what the hey, even if
you were impulsive —— chances are
your tattoowill bring you delight for
years to come (if not the rest of your
life). And it might make you feel just
a little bit tough, too. ’

GOOD GRIEF

Gas drilling in Pennsylvania:
What thefraek?

Michael Good
Columnist

It might not come as a surprise
to either natives or transplants,
but Pittsburgh’s rivers are dirty.
So dirty, in fact, that last year
nonproﬁt organization American
Rivers declared the Monongahela
River the country’s ninth most en-
dangered waterway. In all likeli-
hood, the Mon has not been clean
since William Penn purchased the
tract of land that became Pennsyl-
vania. And you can break out the
Brita ﬁlters and the water bottles
because, my friends, it is getting
worse.

In the last decade, the Mar-
cellus Shale industry expanded
from Western Pennsylvania to
the eastern end of the state and
throughout the country. Support-
ers of natural gas extraction hail
the region as the Saudi Arabiafof
North America, and since natu-
ral gas burns cleaner than coal,
many believe that investment in
this industry is the ﬁrst step to
U.S. energy independence and
development of alternative fuel
sources. Yet the process known
as hydrofracking used to extract
the gas faces intensifying scrutiny
from the mainstream and indepen-
dent media.

The problem?

i Natural gas companies, for all
intents and purposes, have free
rein to drill and buy up land as they
please, at least in Pennsylvania.
Natural gas drilling does not need
to adhere to the Clean Water Act
— since 2004, according to Pro-
Publica —‘nor do inspectors need
to clearly state possible side effects

of water contamination. Particu-
lar to Pennsylvania, our dear Gov.
Tom Corbett — who believes that
Pennsylvania’s universities should
shoulder more of the state’s deﬁ-
cit —— has the courtesy neither to
levy a severance tax on drilling
nor to impose more stringent
standards on the industry, which

claims that its drilling technology »

is high—tech enough to prevent

Post—Gazette.

The industry itself claims that
drillers self-regulate safely and
effectively and that drilling poses
no real threat to the environment
and groundwater. But the more
research that is undertaken, the
less substantiated the industry’s
arguments become.

Drillers extract natural gas

environmental degradation. The
peak demonstration so far of Gov.

Corbett’s awareness of potential‘

environmental hazards of drill-
ing has been the establishment
of the Marcellus Shale Advisory
Commission, which must report
back to the governor — in 120 days
—— possible ways-to balance the
economic proﬁts of drilling with
its environmental consequences.
Thirteen of the commission’s 30
members have ties to the gas in-
dustry, according to the Pittsburgh

drofracking, a term derived from
the phrase “hydraulic fracturing.”
In essence, millions of gallons of
water are mixed with a menagerie
of chemicals and are shot deep
underground into each natural
gas well. This process causes the
rock layers deep below to fracture.
Gas pours from the cracks created
and is then harvested and reﬁned.
Muchas with Taco Bell meat’s re-
cently publicized “secret ingredi-
ents,” the contents of frack water
are typically unknown.

The Monongahela is one dump-
ing site for this frack water -— once
treated, according to the Post- Ga-
zette ——- but regional treatment fa-
cilities simply are not equipped to
adequately purify the chemically
laced water. Not from Pittsburgh?
Well, you might have even more
reason for concern. American Riv-
ers declared the Delaware River,

running from New York all along"

the eastern coast of Pennsylvania,
the nation’s most endangered river.

There are thousands of proposed.

drill sites along the Delaware.

’ In the recent Academy
Award-nominated documentary
“Gasland” — which screened in
Frick Park last August — a dramat-
ic scene occurs. The ﬁlm’s director,
John Fox, visits Weld County, Colo.,
where the natural gas industry is
far more established than in Penn-
sylvania. In the scene, a resident
actually ignites his tap water with
a cigarette lighter (the scene has
garnered thousands of views on
YouTube). The Post-Gazette re-
ports that the Monongahela is
dangerously close to surpassing
the EPA’s limits for what consti-
tutes clean drinking water. .

The natural gas industry often
succeeds in landing million-dollar
mineral rights leases from land-
owners. Advice for landowning
Pennsylvanians if approached by
gas drillers? Hire a lawyer. And as
for us students, we can seemingly
do even less, beyond being aware
of the situation and voting cor-
rectly when the time comes.

RECAP

B.R.A. showcases the possibilities of lingerie

Anna Weldon
Staff Writer

Last night, 30 fraternity broth-
ers strutted, danced and teased an
audience in an array of donated
bras —— and all for a good cause.

Pitt’s Students in Free Enter-
prise teamed up with Kathleen
Kirkwood’s Bra Recycling Agency
for last night’s runway show held
in the William Pitt Union. The show
raised funds to support B.R.A. and
breast cancer research.

Kathleen Kirkwood, founder of
B.R.A., began the program in order
to ﬁnd a successful solution for the
waste produced by the disposal of
used bras.

“The sight of all the containers
of bras being loaded onto freight
trains, it was a devastating image,”
she said.

On Dec. 9 last year, Kirkwood ’

successfully recycled 10,000 bras.
B.R.A. ground the donated bras and
removed the steel wire. They then
transformed the ﬂuff-like substance

into a red carpet, which was ﬁrst
featured at a recent Oscar-related
event.

The remaining wire is sold to
scrap-metal plants, and the money
obtained goes to breast cancer re-
search through MetroHealth. Kirk-
wood plans to create more of the
recycled red carpets and sell them
for VIP events.

Delta Sigma Pi, MetroHealth,
Campus representatives of PINK
and Greek Life have all contribut-
ed their time and resources to the
event. Pitt sororities donated old
bras in an attempt to win a com-
petition. The donated bras were
featured in the show.

“People will come up to me and
just hand me a bra at dinner,” said
Stephanie Campbell, SIFE Presi-
dent.

Campbell collected more than 70
bras prior to the event and received
a large, uncounted number at the
end of the night. Though only some
of the bras made an appearance on
the catwalk, SIFE will donate them
all to B.R.A. to be recycled.

SI_FE raised over $150 in funds

from the runway show. Tickets
cost ﬁve dollars each. The pro-
ceeds from the runway show will
beneﬁt B.R.A.’s recycling program
and MetroHealth for breast cancer
research.

There were about 30 volunteer
male models in the B.R.A. Runway
Show who are all aﬂiliated with a
fraternity. The show featured ﬁve
different themes that SIFE desig-
nated to the separate groups.

Delta Tau Delta strutted the run-
way forthe introduction, which fea-
tured the “original,” or plain, bra,
and a suit theme wherein broth-
ers wore suit jackets and ties over
their lingerie. They then stripped
off their jackets to expose colored
bras.

Brothers from Phi Delta The-
ta and Pi Lambda Phi modeled
the jungle theme, wearing zebra
and cheetah patterned bras with
splattered paint on their faces and
bodies. The models growled at the
audience.

Zeta Beta Tau modeled the beach
theme, wearing glasses and towels
over their brightly colored bras.

Maia Woluchem I Staff Photographer
Members of Phi Delta Theta and Pi Lambda Phi —— two of the fraternities that showed their support for the cause last night — sported exotic bras in accordance with a “Jungle” theme.

Pi Kappa Alpha closed the show
as Angels, imitating the well-known
Victoria’s Secret models. These
brothers danced and shimmered,
clad in silver glitter and wings.

The boys worked the runway to
mixes by D] Aaron Komhauser, a
sophomore brother at Delta Tau
Delta. The models gyrated, did
tricks and ﬂexed their muscles as

, ﬁnal poses at the end of the cat-

walk.

Ryan Disabato, a sophomore
brother at Pi Kappa Alpha, mod-
eled a black, lacy bra size 36DD
and wings. Disabato got involved
in the event because the proceeds
for the event went to a good cause,
and he saw the show as a chance
to have fun.

“And we’re pro—glitter,” DiSa-
bato said.

Campbell viewed using the fra-
ternities as an ideal “marketing
strategy,” and hop ed that the word
of the event would spread because
of Greek Life’s involvement. The
event ended up receiving many
enthusiastic guests who screamed
and cheered for the scantily clad

fraternity brothers.
Kirkwood thought the male
‘models helped to lighten the som-
ber topic of waste. ‘

“We cannot avoid waste, but if
we focus too much on the damag-
ing effects and not the fun parts
of recycling, we won’t energize a
group,” she said.

Everyone who attended the Run-
way Show received _a complimen-
tary “Bra Envelope” they can use
to recycle old bras. The envelopes
came already addressed to B.R.A.,
and the organization asked attend-
ees to send at least two bras in th
package. . *

At the end of theshow, the mod-

els walked the runway one last time i

as a group. Kirkwood and Camp-
bell joined them to yell, “Don’t burn
your bra, recycle it,” her personal
motto for B.R.A.

Zach Zeli, the vice president of
project development, saw a posi-
tive future for the transformed
lingerie.

“Even after these bras are re— V

cycled, they continue to support
breasts,” he said. ;:

Andrey Avinoff: In Pursuit of
Beauty V

Now throughjuly 24
Carnegie Museum of Art
Works on Paper Gallery

Andrey Avinoff pursued many

p things. He was a gentleman-in-

waiting to Russia’s-Nicholas II. He
conducted research in the moun-
tains of Tibet. He worked.as a dairy
farmer in upstate New York and as a
commercial illustrator in New York.
And then he "came to Pittsburgh.
He remained here as director of

the Carnegie Museum of Artuntil '

1945, when a heart attack ended
his career and sent him back to the
Big Apple, where he died four years

. later. But now, in a sense, he has
- returned to his old haunt in Oak-

land.‘ ‘ _
From now untiljuly 24, the Car-
negie Museum of Art is hosting an

       

exhibition of the Russian artist’s
work. The collected products of
his artisticsensibilities are a ka-
leidoscopic menagerie of sinuous
botanical imagery, ﬂuttering but-
terﬂies and the vivid reds, greens
and browns representative of the

. human experience, which, for Avi-

noff, ranged from the earthy to the
sensual, from the transcendent to
the apocalyptic.

So why the rediscovery? And
why now? Simply put: serendip-
ity. A relative of Avinoff contacted
Louise Lippincott, curator of ﬁne
arts at the Carnegie Museum of Art,
and told her about the never-before-
seen works now on display, which
Avinoff’s relatives had hanging up in

their homes. A little bit of research -

revealed the wild and wonderful
watercolor world of a Pittsburgh
icon. V

According to Kirk Savage, chair
of Pitt’s department of history of
art and architecture, “it’s a rela-
tively small exhibit” that is “really
beautiﬁil” with “carefully chosen

works.” Savage added that the goal
of the exhibit is “to reintroduce us
to .an important 20th-century ﬁg-

‘ ure‘who’s not well known today.”
The exhibit tells the modern tale 1
of a man who grew up in a world

lost in the cataclysm of the Russian
Revolution. “It’s a story of someone
who lost one life and had to ﬁnd
another.” -
The title‘ of the exhibit and its
companion book is “Andrey Avinoff:

‘ In Pursuit of Beauty,” and its works

encompass the artist’s seemingly
diverse interests. But according to,
Lippincott, the book’s author, “He

 saw [all his interests] as intercon-

nected.” For Avinoff, beauty was an
organizing concept for the physical
world, from the entomological to

C the imperial. A poem from the book

reads: “Empires collapse. Butterﬂies
endure.”

As does Avinoff’s legacy as mu-
seum director, the job he held from

1926 to 1945. Although he made a

Saturday at 8 p.m.

New Hazlett Theater

Free with a Pitt ID

Most people can recognize common, Western
instruments at a typical concert performance.
But Newband, a microtonal music ensemble,
doesn’t hold typical concerts. '

This Saturday, Music on the Edge, along
with The Andy Warhol Museum, will present
Newband and the Harry Partch Instruments at
the New Hazlett Theater in the Northside. The
group ﬁrst performed in Pittsburgh in 1993,
and this weekend’s concert will beits return
to the city.

Musicians Dean Drummond and Stefani
Starin co-founded Newband in 1977.

“It was really just because we needed an

outlet to perform,” said Drummond, who serves
as associate professor and director of the Harry
Partch Institute at Montclair University.

Newband has evolved over the years. Today,
it’s an ensemble focused primarily on micro—
tonal music. The group’s members play the
Harry Partch Instrument Collection, which
they obtained in 1990, as well as a few more
commonly known instruments such as the ﬂute
and the cello.

Musical innovator Harry Partch created his
instrument collection speciﬁcally to be able
to produce microtonal sounds. The collection
involves an array of instruments, some of which
are adapted from Western models.‘

Each composition performed in the concert
employs rnicrotonal music.,The technique uses
“the notes in between the notes on the piano,”
said Mathew Rosenblum, the chair of Pitt’s de—
partment of music and co—director of the Music
on the Edge series.

Microtonal music is said to have a richer
sound than music produced using more com-
monly known instruments, with greater pos-
sibilities of variation for composers and musi— - P
cians.

'‘ I ‘fMicrotonal music is like goingto anart store 

and buyingi144 colors,” Drummond said. ..

The instruments come in all shapes and sizes ’
— including very large. One instrument from -
the collection is the bass marimba —— a giant
device made from Sitka Spruce blocks that lie
over organ pipes. . ..

As a collection" on stage, the instruments
look straight out of a Dr. Seuss book, Drum-
mond said.

For this concert there will be a total of nine

are used, Drummond explained.

Rosenblum is credited as one of the compos-
ers for this weekend’s concert, having written
“Yonah’s l)_ream” forthe performance — a piece
that incorporates some of the Harry Partch
Instruments, as well as familiar instruments like

' the ﬂute. Rosenblum said the piece was inspired
V when he attended ajewish wedding with an

ecstatic ambiance. He thought, what if Harry

of them are mellow,” Starin said. 5; .

very good living as a commercial artist before
coming to Pittsburgh and as a ﬁne artist in

New York afterwards, Lippincott said, Avi— V

noff’s assiduity and alacrity in driving the
museum forward as an instrument of educa-
tion left a substantial impact on the city. “He
tried to show Pittsburgh a bigger world than
they were used to,” Lippincott said.

When Avinoff joined the museum in the
1920s, the staff was more concerned with

, collecting than displaying. He changed that,

focusing on promoting intemationalism to
that end. The Carnegie Museum began to
collaborate with other museums throughout
the world. When Pitt began discussion of its
Nationality Rooms, Avinoff was one of the
ﬁrst to play a major role in their design and
development. The Carnegie Museum of Art,
like Pitt a generation later, had expanded its
vision of itself in the world, Lippincott_ said.
Also like Pitt, the museum maintained
strong ties to the community even as it be-
came a draw as a regional educational insti-
tution. “What was really amazing was that
during _the Great Depression [Avinoff] kept

- the place open,” Lippincott said. His success-

ful administration forestalled disaster, not
only for his employees, but for his and the
Museum’s future.

Natural History, “A lot of his acquisitions were "
for the people of Pittsburg .”

These included the Tyrannosaurus rex
holotype, the ﬁrst fossil of the species in the
world. Avinoff additionally acquired hun-
dreds of thousands of butterﬂies, provided
hundreds of his own original botanical draw».
ings of the ﬂora of western Pennsylvania and
supported the expansion of the Hall of North
American Wildlife, one of the most popular

draws of the Museumof Natural History.

These were “not only beautiful, but used for
scientiﬁc purposes,”’Kish ‘said.

“For him, art and science were intimately
connected occupations,” added Lippincott.

Avinoff’s artistic pursuits were no dalli-
ance. His art lay “somewhere between a hobby
and an obsession,” said Ellenjames, assistant
director of marketing for the Carnegie Mu-
seum of Art. “He was a very proud man. He
was a very serious man. He thought he could
do more than just be an associate curator.”

Avinoff died -in 1949 in the midst of a ﬂurry
of unﬁnished media proﬁles on the man, the
myth, the legend, leaving behind such friends
andassociates as sexologist Alfred Kinsey and
novelist Vladimir Nabokov.

George Santayana deﬁned beauty as “plea—
sure objectiﬁed,” but Avinoff’s art, like his
legacy, encompasses more than aesthetics.
It is a pursuit of education.

‘ WASHINGTON — On a day ﬁlled
with buzzer-beaters, upsets and

close games, the Pitt men’s bas-
ketball team avoided all of that and
took care of business by beating
UNC-Asheville 74-51 on Thursday
at the Verizon Center.

“We just gotta take it one game
at a time,” Pitt guard Ashton Gibbs
said after the game. “I think if we
do that we’ll be ﬁne, and just keep
playing our game.”

In Pitt’s quest to make history
by earning a Final Four bid for the
ﬁrst time since the tournament ex-
panded to 64 teams, the Panthers
ﬁrst had to avoid making a differ-
ent kind of history by avoiding

becoming the ﬁrst No. 1 seed to ,

early struggles, as the Panthers
racked up eight giveaways before
halftime. But in the second half
Pitt pulled away thanks to an of-
fensive outburst by Gibbs, who‘
ﬁnished with 26 points and six
3-pointers.

“I just tried to move it without
the ball,” Gibbs said of his strong
second half. “We’ve been in dif-
ferent situations like this. Now it
was just our turn to be patient and
let the game come to us. My team-
mates did a great job of passing me
the ball to get open spots.”

Pitt’s Nasir Robinson chipped
in with 12 points and Gilbert Brown
added nine points and nine re-'
bounds to go along with center
Gary McGhee’s 11 rebounds to lead
the Panthers on the boards.

Pitt’s strong rebounding also
doomed the Bulldogs, as the Pan-
thers won the battle of the boards

lose to a No. 16.

For a while, it appeared as if
UNC-Asheville might have a chance
to pull off the monumental upset,
thanks to several ﬁrst—half mis-
takes by the Panthers.

“We had a decent lead in the
ﬁrst half, and a couple turnovers
brought it back,” Pitt head coach
Jamie Dixon said after the game.
“[UNC-Asheville] is a good team,
and they took advantage of those
opportunities. Ashton [Gibbs]
obviously shot much better in the
second.”

UNC-Asheville held Gibbs, Pitt’s
leading scorer, to just six points in
the ﬁrst half. Early in the second
half, Pitt had just a three—point lead

. over the Bulldogs.

“I felt we battled them really
well in the ﬁrst half and we just
needed to play better,” UN C-
Asheville coach Eddie Biedenbach
said. “I think Pitt is a really good
team.”

' . Turnovers caused many ofPitt’s

50-27, marking the sixth time this
season that Pitt surpassed 50 re-
bounds.

Bulldog guard Matt Dickey led,v
his team with 21 points, and guard
J.P. Primm added 14.

After the game, Dixon once
again ﬁelded questions about
whether Pitt can ﬁnally get over
the hurdle and make it to the Fi-
nal Four.

“I think that every team has the
belief that they can win the Nation-
al Championship, every player on
every one of these teams. And so I
think we’re just like those teams,”
Dixon said. “But we’re really fo-_._.,
cused on the next game.”

Up next on Pitt’s road to Hous-
ton is another team of Bulldogs.
No. 8 seed Butler defeated No. 9
Old Dominion on Thursday after-
noon thanks to a buzzer-beater
by Matt Howard. The 2010 NCAA;
Tournament runner-up will face
Pitt on Saturday at the Verizon
Center. 3

popular team to pull off an upset and
not only beat Butler, but the Panthers
as well.

Old Dominion was seventh in re-
bounds per game this season with 40.2,
one spot ahead of Pitt, who pulled down
39.8 per game during the regular sea-
son.

But Butler edged the Monarchs in
rebounds by one, 28-27, leading the
Bulldogs to victory.

The Panthers will needto play tough
on the glass with Butler, who clearly
showed that they can rebound with the
best of the them.

“They’re a very physical team. That’s

_ what I’ve seen in the little bit I’ve watched

them,” Pitt head coachjamie Dixon said.
“Very physical, very aggressive on the
ball, and we’ve got to be prepared for a
physical defense from them.”

Of Butler’s 28 rebounds, 17 were on
the offensive side of the ball, which gave
the Bulldogs plenty of second—chance
scoring opportunities.

, Pitt will look to senior center Gary
McGhee to limit the Bulldogs to one shot

V on offense and give the Panthers second

opportunities on missed shots.
McGhee pulled down 11 rebounds
and sored seven oints in the team’s

     
 

win over UNC-Asheville, whereas Butler
star center Matt Howard, grabbed five
rebounds and scored 15 points in his
team’s ﬁrstgame.

The Panthers will have the task of
stopping Butler’s leading scorers How-
ard and Shelvin Mack, who average
16.7 and 15.2 points per game, respec-
tively.

“I know Mack very well because I
coached him with the USA Team {two
summers ago],” Dixon said. “So I know
they’re very good. But I think we under-
stand that they have a good balanced
team.”

In order to defeat the Bulldogs, Pitt
will need leading scorer Ashton Gibbs
to continue his hot shooting. .

Gibbs’ scoring-— he averages 16.7
points per game and scored 26 on Thurs-

' day — is a strong indication that his

Panthers could make the Final Four in
Houston.

A Panthers’ win will send the team to
New Orleans for the Sweet Sixteen, but
Pitt isn’t looking ahead to that. It’s just
focusing on the game at hand.

“[They’re] focused solely on Butler,
and there’s no thought to what’s after
that,” Dixon said. “It’s solely on our next
0 onent.” I

BIG EAST BREAKDOWN

Mixed expectations for Big East teams in tourney

Donnie Tasser
Stajf Writer

As expected, the Big East had 11 teams chosen
for the NCAA Tournament, the most ever by
far. The Big East tournament was predictably
unpredictable, with some outcomes expected
and others surprising.

The teams that were on the decline at the
end of the regular season, suchasvillanova and
Georgetown, turned in disappointing perfor-
mances, and neither Pitt nor Notre Dame, the
top two seeds, made the ﬁnals.

Kembawalker carried the Connecticut Hus-
kies to atoumamentvictory from a No. 9 seed, a
feat hehas accomplished in one form oranother
time and time again. Despite outlastingthe Irish
in overtime, the Louisville Cardinals could not
weather the Walker storm in the ﬁnal.

With thatbeingsaid, here’s my outlookfor Big
East teams in this year’s NCAA Tournament:

Dangerous Teams:

1. Connecticut Huskies — Walker has
proven he cancarrythisteam. And whenhisteam
backs himup, itis downright dangerous. There is
no one who Iwould trustwith the ball more inthe
ﬁnal seconds of the game than Walker: The Hus-
kies are very capable of making a deep run.

waitress
babysitter

cashier

2. Syracuse Orange — Coach Jim Boe-
heim knows exactlywhat he is doing come tour-
nament time and his Orange are peaking at the
right time. They likewise are very capable of a
deep run, and an upset or two could put them
in Final Four position.

3. St.]ohn’s — The Red Storm’s strongﬁn-
ish in the regular season did not translate into
success at the Big East tournament as well as
I thought it would, but they are still a team to
be reckoned with. Especially considering that,
during regular season play, they have already
defeated the No. 1 seed in their region: Pitts-

burgh.

Worrisome Teams:

1.Pitt;sbu1gh —- The Panthers went one-
and-done at the Big East tournament. Is that so
worrying? Not really, because they already had
a No. 1 seed locked up and have played extraor-
dinarily well all season. But they have a history
of unspectacular tournament runs, and that, not
the UConn loss, scares me a little.

2. Villanova -- Boy, have this team fallen
off. Not too long ago, I would have forecast the
Wildcats upsetting No. 1 seed Ohio State. The
Wildcats went from bona ﬁde Final Four con-
tender halfway through the season to possibly
not even winning their ﬁrst round game.

3. Georgetown — Like Villanova, George-
town is not playing its best right now. The Hoyas

g are in a very nice place in the bracket, but they

with a daily newspaper.

Responsibilities include managing a geographic territory,
face-to—far:e sales and prospecting for new business.

§fanding behind
BYU’s honor code

Isaac Saul
Staﬁ’ Writer

In the world of college sports, poor be-
havior among athletes on scholarship is
all too prominent.

Just recently, our own University was
put under the public magnifying glass
when CBS and Sports Illustrated com-
piled a collaborative report revealing that
nearly one quarter of Pitt’s scholarship
football players had a criminal record.

Unfortunately, in many instances, the
pressures of the lucrative sports indus-
try lead to schools giving top athletes
a slap on the wrist when they deserve
jail time.

Vai Sikahema:

the school’s potential National Champi-
onship. If the team exits early from the
upcoming NCAA Tournament because it
is missing its star center, all of the play-
ers who have worked hard and obeyed
the rules will miss out on a once in a
lifetime opportunity to win a National
Championship.

Yet the school’s alumni have come out
strongly in support of the university’s
decision to suspend Davies.

“Sorry, I’m choking up a bit here,”
Philadelphia sportscaster Vai Sikahe-
ma, a former NFL return specialist who
played for BYU in the mid-19805, told
Time Magazine. “It’s just hard for me to
express just how immensely proud I am
of my university.”

Sorry, I’m choking up

a bit here. lt’s just hard

for me to express just  

how immenselyproud I

am of my university.  

That’s why a couple of weeks ago, when
I heard that Brigham Young University
was suspending basketball starting center
Brandon Davies for the remainder of the
season, I was shocked. ,

BYU, which at the time of the suspen-
sion was ranked No. 3 in the country,
forced Davies off the court for Violat-
ing the school’s honor code. His crime?
Having sex with his girlfriend, which the
honor code prohibits.

Davies, who was averaging 11.1 points
and 6.2 rebounds, is a key player for the
Cougars, who were trounced by New
Mexico 82-64 in their ﬁrst game with-
out him. .

That’s right: proud. Well guess what,
Mr. Sikahema, I’m proud too. I’m proud
of you and all the other BYU alumni who
have come-out in support of your univer-
sity while the general public has frowned
upon its decision. You have to have a spe-
cial kind of respect for aschool that sticks
to its principles. _l »

BYU’s honorcode, which requires stu-
dents to “live a chaste and virtuous 1ife,”
also says that those enrolled must abstain
from alcoholic beverages, tobacco, tea
and coffee, as well as substance abuse.

Once this honor code was made public,
there was a ‘bit of an uproar. Prohibit-

BYU’s decision justified

Saul < 16

ing college students from sex, alcohol,
caffeine and tobacco? It sounds tyran-
nical and unrealistic. But considering
the school is owned and operated by
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter—day
Saints, it’s a. code widely respected and
still adhered to by many current BYU
students and alumni as well as members
of the faith in general.

So my question is, how can you defend
Davies’ actions? Yes, he’s a college student
with raging hormones. Yes, people make
mistakes. .I don’t think he did anything
wrong. I feel sympathy for him and his
teammates who will pay the price.

But hey, this kid is good. He could"
have played for a hundred other Division
I programs, but he ‘chose BYU. Like 98
percent of the BYU student body, Davies
is a Mormon. Like 100 percent of the BYU
student body, Davies knew exactly what
the honor code contained.

“The honor code is an essential part of
your recruitment to BYU,” Hall of Fame
quarterback and ESPN analyst Steve
Young, who played at BYU from 1981-
83, told Time Magazine. “It’s not like you
find out later, ‘Oh, you didn’t tell me! I
didn’t know that!’ But there’s a spirit on
campus that is just, ‘OK, fine, now let’s
go have a good time.”’ .

By suspending Davies, BYU sent a mes-
sage to the entire college sporting world
that was very clear: Athletes should be
held responsible for their actions just
like everyone else. _ .

In fact, athletes’ public exposure
should increase their roles as positive
representations of both their universi-

. ties and themselves. This year, a Rob-

ert Morris player from Pittsburgh got a
four—game suspension after receiving a
DUI charge.

In February, two players from Mar-
shall University were charged with bat-
tery over a bar ﬁght —— they played in a
game the-next evening. ' ~

ken -common moral codes of conduct and

been excused. Two years ago, a University
of Florida football player intentionally
gouged an opponent’s eyes. He was sus-
pended for one half of a game.

The truth is that Brigham Young Uni-
versity made the right decision — it held
a student-athlete accountable for his mis-
takes and took the correct line of action
when it needed to. My only hope is that
the rest of the college sports world fol—
lows its lead. I
