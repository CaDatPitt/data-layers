Hospital Plan

 iigain Offered
 Students

if By SIDNEY KLEIN

Pitt students will, this semester,

fiagain have an opportunity to enjoy
a the beneﬁts of the University’s
:53 student hospitalization service.
 Sponsored by the Pitt News, the
“Student Health Service for Men,

  
    
 

under the direction of Dr. H. C.
arlson, and the Student Health

rvice for Women under the direc-
fond of Dr. Auleene M. J amison, the

wihospitalization plan branches from
-.-the Hospital Service Association of
;I,’ittsburgh. ,

_Under the new three semesters

 -per year basis, the charge for a

semester is $2.25. This charge
p makes available to the student
1 room. and board in ward accom-
. modations for a total of 21 days
each school year or an allowance
- of $3.00 per day toward the pur-

chase of private or semi-private
A accommodations; use of operat-
ing room as often as necessary;
anasthesia, drugs and medica-

tions, dressings or casts, labora-

tory service, and X-ray.

 VThe-se services will be available
X in any one of the 95 member hos-
,7, pitals during the period covered by
if  contract. For emergency illness
 or accident, the service may extend
 other non-member hospitals.

_ Student hospitalization at Pitt is
-woyears old. It has grown from
a small organization beneﬁtting

 the comparatively few men and
j women who live in fraternity or
 boarding houses to a service for the

 entire student body. ’

The plan was originally adopt-

 ed to help out-of-town students
’ who needed immediate care, but

/did not have the necessary funds.

A: The removal to a hospital also

helped to safeguard the other
: residents of the fraternity or
boarding house.

Students may register for the
service at the Women’s Student

'Health service, 28th floor», Cathe-
dral, or the Men's Student Health
service on the 34th ﬂoor. Booths
7 will also be maintained on the ﬁrst
 floor during school registration.

p The fee is payable at the treas-
iurer’s office, 2409, Cathedral, be-

 fore October 10.

OlActivities

Only 75 more freshmen can be
accommodated at Camp Kon-O-
Kwee, approximately 100 having
already registered, Camp Director
and Y.M.C.A. Executive. Secretary
William L. Hammaker announced
last Friday. Those freshmen wish-
ing to go who are still unregistered
may sign up at the freshman camp
desk on the main ﬂoor of the Cathe-

dral during registration. The fee,-

including expenses involved in
meals, lodging, program and inci-
dentals is $4.50.

Gus Wilde, camp manager and
Bill Clemmer, program director
urge all summer freshmen and en-
tering freshmen to attend the three-
day trip as the best method for
becoming oriented with the Univer-
sity. '

Faculty members and upper-
classmen will bethere to meet the
newcomers.

John -Palmer, C45, commenting

you excuse the slang, swell; I would

like to come again next year if‘

such an apportunity is presented.”
Typical of the many A comments

heard was Herbert Spencer’s, ‘C45, ,
opinion that camp was “something ‘

no freshman can afford to miss.

It’s a week's fun put into three
days and a real beginning for as

school year."

In line with America’s all-out “war effort the University

announced last week that orientation for incoming freshmen I

men students had been dropped and that in its place the new

students will be required to take a
one-credit course in competitive
athletics. .

The program has been set up to
meet the requirements of students
who are members of the enlisted
Naval Reserve. Members of the

ashguests of the University.

The

 

 War heroes from Britain, the Soviet Union, the Netherlands and
China, who attended last month’s International Student Assembly may
visit the University as a stopover on their tour of t.he'United States.

L‘ Chancellor Clohn G. Bowman accepted the invitation of International

Army Reserve are not required to
take part in the program to main-
tain their reserve standing, but are
being urged to take the course
nevertheless.

Aolng with the one credit re-
quired to be taken by all freshmen,
those who are not electing ROTC
may elect a second eredit'in com-
petitive athletics in place of the
regular physical education course.
Thus, all new students must have
either one credit of the new athletic
course and one credit in physical
educationgéor one athletic credit and

one ROTC credit, or two éredits in
competitive athletics.

Upperclassmen may elect two
credits in the new athletic pro-
gram. The credits elected this
year by all students will be
counted t o w a r d s graduation.
However the number of credits
taken after this year, if -the,pro-
gram is continued, that will be
counted towards graduation has
not been determined as yet.

The program as outlined above
is for students in the College and
School of Business Administration.
Students in the Schoolof Engineer-
ing will probably follow the same
athletic program that was used
during the summer session.

   Mu. Not 3.51.5.1.

We welcome you, the ﬁrst fall war-time freshman class

1 of the Universityxof Pittsburgh.

You enter the University in the midst of one of its most

0 I iediﬂicult transitions-—-the old, the tired, the outworn elements

 

 are slowly losing hold and in their place come new, bold, im-
~‘ _ aginative, courageous ideas and policies.

Transitions are always painful——much more so to those

 ‘who stand ﬁrmly by the status-quo, who resist change and
- ' ‘ growth and progress. And we believe that still more change

aiid growth and institution of new ideas is on its way, change
like increased government subsidization of universities and

I *  _ colleges, enabling more and more people to come to colleges——

people who were once kept out simply because they hadn’t

A  "the money to go to school.

There’s going to be a change in the whole idea of why

, ,'you’re in college to accompany this change in who is here.
. No longer are the colleges to be training grounds for a post-

graduation, unchecked, death-struggle in the competition of

A I private interest against private interest.

Because if society is helping you go to college, it is doing

V * soon the premise that you are there to help society and the

 

 

common good. And this is no mere theory, either. It was said

 ; by John W. Studebaker, U. S. Commissioner of Education.

It was reiterated by president of Chicago University, Robert
Maynard Hutchins.

V Army and Navy Believe in it

It was borne out by the army and the navy, who will grant
deferments in enlisted reserve plans only to students who
realize that colleges and universities must be “places of in-
tense achievement and accomplishment.”

, And with these two major concept changes in education

are going to come many other, smaller changes, changes in

olicy, in details, all to the end of making this a stronger, ﬁner
niversity.

We urge you, the class of ’46, to help that growth by
looking to the future for your ideas—forgetting about the
order of 1928, of 1939, of 1941——look with us to the better

school and the world of the future, a future for which each and ‘
« necessary to secure this reduced

every one of us must plan, because it is to be ours.

Time-worn traditions and attitudes and prejudices that‘

bind you to that which is, must be overcome in favor of a free,
broad, open outlook. Your goal in college must be to synthe-
size and organize everything to be learned here into a direction
-——shaping the better world of the future.

To that we pledge you, along with ourselves. Along with

 the students in the retreating, thatch—roofed, disease ridden
it universities of China. Along with the students remaining in I

the nearly depleted universities of Great Britain——students
who have seen over ﬁfty per cent of their fellow-collegians
called to service at the age of eighteen. 1

With Students of Allied Lands

_ We must work side by side with students of the Soviet
Union-——where it is the universal practice for students to give
all their holidays and week—end recesses to the war effort——-
digging trenches, acting as ﬁre—wardens, doing ﬁrst—aid work,
serving in medical detachments. We must strengthen our fel-

lowship with Australian students, where each collegian is

required to spend a part ofeach day digging trenches, building

i_ bomb-shelters, constructing gun-emplacements.

~ Ours is a common battle with the brave Dutch students,

‘ who have seen many of their schools shut down by the Ger-

mans because the universities of Holland formed the spear-
head of the anti—Nazi underground movement. But education

I continues in the Netherlands, where classes meet, in many-

cases secretly, in the homes of professors.
Norway, Fighting France, Czechoslovakia, Belgium, Po-
land, Greece, all these countries boast of a national student

0 ‘ body ﬁghting doggedly and heroically against Fascism.

It is for the American student to join with his fellows all
over the world in that struggle. We, who have thus far done
so little must not break faith with those who already have
done so much.

Book. Exchange ,
rOpens Thursday

Men's Council book exchange will
again be open this semester to en-
able students to buy and sell used
books. From 10:30 to 2:30 o’clock
Thursday and Friday of this week,
students should bring books they
wish to sell to 832 Cathedral. The
exchange will be open during these
hours all next week for both receiv-
ing and selling books.

Sponsored by Men’s Council at
the beginning of each semester, the
book exchange is conducted for
the purpose of creating a clearing
house for the sale of cheaper, used
text books. "

Students who wish to sell their
books may set the price. This is
usually two-thirds of new book
value. The exchange deducts ﬁfteen
per cent of this amount for its serv-
ice and adds this to the loan fund.

Serving on the committee, headed
by Richard Briney, C45, are John
Reid, C43, Andrew Kramer, C43,
Paul E. Pﬁschner, C44, James Dunn,
C44, Dave Truan, C43, and Cal
Levenson, C4-5.

This University is built on a
dream, and the spirit of that dream
still lives in the hearts of the peo-

ple who gather here to share in the »

opportunities it oﬁers. That spirit
of faith in«the goodness and the
beauty of life turned a dream into
a magnificent . reality, and that
faith still motivates the life of the
University. Its very name -—- The
Cathedral of Learning———shows how
important that spirit is, for a cathe-
dral means a building dedicated to
things of the spirit, and the Uni-
versity is vitally concerned in what
spirit the student approaches the
process of learning.

Perhaps, after many months
here you may become too busy with.
the routine of classes that you will
not feel that same sense of breath-
taking awe you had when ﬁrst you
saw the Cathedral in the morning
mist, or in the quiet dusk of eve-S

BOB DAVIS

In the .Army and Temple encoun-
ter’s last season, Davis had little
ditliculty in-walking off with top
honors in the half-mile event.
Allias, on the other hand, was
somewhat less of a sensation at
Springdale High, but quickly found
his bearings as soon as he came to
Pitt. During his sophomore and
junior years, Allias always placed
high among the ace runners of the
country in the annual lC4A cross-
country meet in New York.

Loss of Oliver "Ollie "Still

Mourned By

One of the worst losses Pitt is
likely to sustain was the one re-
ceived three weeks before the
opening of the football season when
Oliver W. (Ollie) Stiff collapsed
suddenly and died. It is difﬁcult to
classify “Ollies” oﬁicial position at
the University for he acted in the
general capacity of man of all
works. -

When he ﬁrst joined the ath-
letic staff in 1925 after working in
the Forbes Field ticket office, his
job was chieﬂy to handle the
tickets. Later his tasks increased-
until he acted as stadium office
manager, checked on the ground-
keeper, handled all the minor
sports trips, and helped distribute
and handle the football tickets.
When intramurals were ﬁrst made
a part of the athletic setup Ollie
acted as a kind of secretary to Jim
Potts, but later his duties cen-

ttGriclclers Open Season Against Gophers

With everything to gain and nothing to lose, Pitt’s un-
heralded football aggregation makes its 1942 debut at the

Minnesota Memorial stadium next Saturday afternoon as ,

underdogs to the champion Minnesota Gophers. _ ‘

However powerful the Gophers may be, it is doubtful
whether either Coach Bowser or the team look to this battle
with forebodings nearly as dire as they did before last year’s

‘contest. But still remembering a

bit of last year’s ﬁnal score, the
undermanned Panther squad is de-

termined to bring back a part of ~

Pitt’s lost prestige.

Football players like Edgar
Jones, Ralph Fife, and Stanley
Gervelis just don’t come oil’ the
Pittsburgh steel assembly line.
And no one has had this fact more
forcibly demonstrated to him
than the astute Charley Bowser,
head coach of the Gridiron Pan-
thers. This trio of football aces
whose cleats carved deep into Pitt
athletic history plunged oil.’ the
graduation plank last June. And
now, in the current campaign,
just how much their presence
meant in the past Panther ma-
chines will be concretely proven.

It is rather hard to say much
about the football squad for they

Sports Fans

tered mainly about the stadium
proper.

There were few men more popu-
lar than he around the Stadium.
His death came as such a shock and
surprise to the men he worked with
and was so keenly felt by all that,
after asking his football players to
bow their heads for a few moments
in respect to “Ollie,” Coach Bowser
cancelled the morning chalk talk.

Frank Carver, athletic publicity
director suummed up the general
opinion of Still’ in the words “He
was a gay, friendly guy. He liked
everybody and was as honest and
reliable as they come.”

a Pittsburgh, Pa.

are more or less a team of mystery.
It is true they have quality. Players
that would easily make any ball
club in the country, but reserves
are scarce.

Once more Pitt is the possessor
of the most unenviable schedule in
the country. A program ﬁlled with
football giants from all over the
country, and for such a card, re-
serves are a necessity.

This year, like last, the coaching
staff expects to lose gamzs. Many
games. But not in the manner they
did last year. The squad is aggres-
sive, tough, and determined to re-
cord an honorable record at the sea-
son’s end. The team will have quite
a few good games in them. Games
in which they will score a ﬂurry of
touchdowns. Maybe it will be next
Saturday, maybe not.

Pitt’s backﬁeld of Dutton, Stet-
ler, Saksa, and West is most ade-
quate. They can all run, pass, kick,
and block. It is rated by the coach-
ing stall‘ one of the best all-around
backﬁeld combinations ever to
show on the Panther practice ﬁeld.

But the line is weak. Kyle and
Gestner will start at the ends and
should prove capable, although
both lack experience. Salvucci and
Durishan, both veteran performers,
are slated. for the tackle posts.
George “Poke” Allshouse will
handle the pivot position. At
guards, Bill Dillon and Vince An-
tonelli will, undoubtedly, handle
the entire game’s duties.

Probably the most outstanding
reserve is Anthony “Primo” Di-
Matteo, sophomore back from
Perry high school. DiMatteo will
see plenty of action in next Satur-
day’s inaugural battle.

  

 

  
    
   
   
       
     
     
     
     
     
       
       
     
      
 
     
     
      

 

 
 

 

 

nlisted   

iopen To Freshmen

.. Nine enlisted reserve branches of the army, the army air
. force, the navy, and the marines are open to University stu-
A dents. They are open to anyone who meets the physical, educa-

tional, and age requirements.
Although it is intended that

. members of these reserve
corps remain in the University
until they receive degrees,
they may be ordered into ac-
tion at any time.

‘ Members of each reserve corps
are expected to maintain their
grades and, for certain services, to
pass a competitive examination in

‘ order to retain reserve status.

Minors must have the consent
of their parents before applying
for membership in any of the en-
listed reserve groups.

Oldest enlisted reserve group at
the University is the ROTC, coast

‘ artillery corps. Following a two-

I: year basic course, each applicant is
rated, given a physical examination,

I selected on a basis of grades, per-
formance in the basic course, mili-
tary aptitude. Upon graduation he
is commissioned a second lieuten-
ant. ’

Established late last spring was
the Army Enlisted Reserve Corps.
Qualiﬁed students in any of the
undergraduate schools of the Uni-
versity may enlist.

’ Qualiﬁed students in electrical
engineering and electronic physics
may be enlisted as privates in the
electronics training group of the

,AERC. After graduation, they will

. be assigned to the Signal corps for
active duty. .

The Army air force has set up
two enlisted reserve groups.
These are ﬂying officer and
ground oﬂicer‘ divisions. After
graduation from each of these
groups, students will be given
specialized training, commission-
ed, and placed in active service.

The Navy has three reserve
groups, V-1, V-5, and V-7.

V-1 members are considered ap-
prentice seamen in the Naval re-

- serve, and after completion of more
than one year’s work at the Uni-
versity they will be transferred, as
they choose, to either V-5 or V-7.

Naval reservists who elect V-5,
will be permitted to ﬁnish the sec-
ond calendar year of university
work, and then they will be trans-
ferred to the Navy for training as
oﬂicer pilots. .

Those who elect V-7 will be
permitted to continue at the Uni-
versity until they have received
their degrees. Then they will go
into the Navy training course pre-
paratory to receiving ensign’s
commissions.

The marines have a candidate's
class for commission, open to any
qualiﬁed undergraduate in the Uni-
versity until the completion of his
education.

Marching Band
Begins Drilling
For Fall Season

University Marching Band began
its fall drills yesterday afternoon in
Schenley Park in preparation for
the coming football season.

Marching drill will be held today

and tomorrow at 4 o’clock. Bob
Davis, C44, head drum major will
drill the band this year, under Lt.
John Finnerty’s direction. A staff
of assistant drum majors will help
Davis.

More than 150 men have applied
for admittance into the Band this
year, according to director Robert
L. Arthur. Attendance at rehears-
als and marching drills, conduct,
and general behavior, as well as
musicianship, will all be considered
when the 120 picked men march
onto the ﬁeld for the ﬁrst game,
October 3.

Southern Methodist’s famous
“swing band” will be the ﬁrst com-
petitor presented to the Pitt Band
this year.

Forthe past three years, the
Band has been undergoing a
g e n e r a l “streamlining,” Mr.
Arthur said. Some of the best col-
lege bands in the country have
performed in Pitt stadium, includ-
ing Ohio State’s all-brass band,
and Michigan’s band noted for its
precision.

Last year the Pitt Band reached
a level of performance never before
equaled in the history of the Uni-
versity, according to reports re-
ceived from men who witnessed-
these performances. Mr. Arthur
promises the ﬁnal perfection to the
“Streamlined Pitt Band” this fall.
