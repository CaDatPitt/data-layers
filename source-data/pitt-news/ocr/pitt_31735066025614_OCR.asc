Governor Ridge expected to make announcement today about state's financial role

Brett Taylor

News Assistant

Governor Tom Ridge is
expected to announce at Pitt today
how much money the state will
grant the University for building
projects, including the long-await-
ed convocation center.

In early October, Pitt asked the
state for $25 million for the convo-
cation center, $25 million for a new
basic-science center and $44 ‘mil-
lion for upgrades and renovations
to existing buildings.

Sources within the University
say Ridge may conﬁrm how much
of the money was approved, if any,

at a 1 pm. press conference in
parking lotF,across ﬁomGate 11
atPitt Stadium. 1 .
When the request was made,
Pitt oﬂicials said they wanted to
use the center for basketball
games, as well as for graduation
ceremonies and other Pitt—spon—
sored activities and concerts.
Former Governor Robert
Casey earmarked $30 million for
the project during his adrr1inist1a-
tion, but in 1993, then-Chancellor
J. Dennis O’Connor agreed to
accept only $13 million in
exchange for getting the money
right away.
‘ ~ Since then, Chancellor Mark

Nordenberg has tried to convince
the state to grant the remaining $17
million.

Students are encouraged to
attend the conference today despite
the secrecy surrounding the
announcement

In an e-mail sent to members
of Pitfs Blue and Gold Society,
Student Government President
Alyson Wallach mged members to
attend because they "are more than
likely to witness a ‘ground break-
ing' event for the University of
Pittsburgh." —

Pitt spokesman Ken Service
also said the armouncement will
result in signiﬁcant changes at Pitt

Wallach said she was asked
not to discuss whether Ridge will
armounce the funding in order to
keep the event "newsworthy."

Pitt Men’s Basketball Coach
Ralph Willard was unavailable for
comment, but was reportedly
promised a convocation center
when he accepted the job at Pitt.

“['Ihe center]’s one of the pri-
mary reasons I came here,” Willard
said in December.

John , Sopcisak, Pitt’s director
of construction, would only say the
future of the center is in the hands
of the ‘government.

"It's been laying dormant for a
few years," he said

Student Government Board
had mixed reactions to questions
about a new convocation center at
last night’s board meeting.

, Board member Mark Murphy
shook his head, smirked and
shrugged his shoulders when
Wallach was asked about it.

Byron Woodson joked that he
didn't even know what a convoca-
tion center was. r

However, board member Liz
Klein seemed enthusiastic about
the prospect of a new convocation
center. ’

"I'm very excited about seeing .

"This is great news."

In 1994, Pitt Police Officer Eric
Rustad rode down Fifth Avenue as a
woman ran out of Pizza Hut yelling
that a girl was being raped in the mens'
restroom.

Rustad, a member of Pitt's less-
than—a—week-old bicycle unit, radioed
for backup. By the timehis partner
arrived, Rustad already had the sus-
pect face down on the ground.

The Officers were able to stop the
attack before the suspect, who was
later convicted, could injure the girl.

"That was the real turning point

for the bike unit. It showed that we
were going to be an eﬂ°ective unit for
the department," said Rick Troy,
Rustad’s partner at the time.

This month, the bike unit begins
its ﬁfth year on Pitt's campus. Rustad,
after being hit by a car while on duty,’
has transferred to a different part of the
department. Troy is the only remain-
ing original member of the unit.

The unit's creator, Capt. Tim
Delaney, said he was wonied about
justifying the unit's existence when it
began operating in January 1994.
That's no longer a concem for the
members, according to Delaney.

“On any given day, 70 to 80 people, at the

It's no bathtub, but this hard bench won't let Mike Giberson fall asleep studying.

Getting a iumpstart to avoid
encl-of-the-semester cramming

Monica Mayk

For The Pitt News

Sitting in the bathtub is a great way to
relax. .

But it's also a great way to study.

Four or ﬁve years ago, Jeanne VV1atr, a
supplemental instruction specialist at Pitt's
Leaming Skills Center, told a student to read
his assignments in ﬂie bathtub when he had
trouble staying awake. That is, a bathtub
without hot water and bubblebath.

"It's comfortable enough for support but
not enough to drift off," said Wratr.

According to VV1atr, the tub's cold
porcelain and the bathroom's bright lighting
helped the student stay awake while reading,
and helped him get through the semester.

While students cram for ﬁnals, they

often realize that the entire process would be '

a lot easier if only they had stayed on top of
course work throughout the semester. But
while many students have jobs, participate
in campus activities and take courses that
require reading piles of material, few stu-
dents know how to keep from falling
behind. Sometimes, it just takes a little cre-
ativity. ‘

Wratr suggested students prioritize
using a large desk calendar and different-
colored ink Recording obligations like class
time, work hours and activities in black per-

manent marker will help students see where '

their leisure time lies. .2

_ "Everyone has the perception that they
have good time management," said Wiatr.
"When they see what they are actually doing
with their time, then they see where they
waste time."

After prioritizing and setting down
obligations in black, students can begin to
set aside effective study and relaxation time.
Vlfiatr stressed that students should plan
everything, even nap time, if they want to
prioritize and manage study time.

Barbara Stout, also a supplemental
instruction specialist for the Learning Skills
Center, said succeeding in a course often
depends on assessing what the professor
expects and deciding what work requires

long preparation time and what just needs

review. '

She suggests students divide course
work into four categories: "Things I don't
know and the professor wants me to loiow,"
"Things I know and the professor wants me
to know," "Things I don't know and I don't
need to know" and "'Ihings I know and don't
need to know." ‘ -

This method helps students concentrate
on the most important aspects of die course
while reading and studying.

Kevin Collins, a Placement Service
adviser at Pitt, stressed" that attending class
on a regular basis is the most important fac-
tor in keeping up with the material. Sharing
notes with friends just isn't enough.

"As you go to lecture, you're going to
develop not: just more knowledge of the
information, but more of an understanding
of the instructor's style, experience and val-
ues," he said. "All those will help you study
because you know what to focus on."

Collins encourages students to seek

help from professors, teaching assistants and '
the Leaming Skills Center early in the term

if they fall behind ,

V "You should never let things go and say
'It‘s too early‘ or ‘I feel stupid approaching
the inst1uctor,"' he said. "Don't let things go
until the end of the term"

For students looking to learn new ways
to study and manage time, the Learning
Skills Centerolfers free ﬁve-week study
skills workshops to help with textbook read-
ing, note taking, test taking, time manage-
ment and improving memory. The work-
shops are meant to teach students concrete
methods of studying and note taking that
will boost retention and understanding.

SACRAMENTO, Calif. — Theodore
Kaczynski is competent to stand trial.
The question now is — who’ll repre-
sent him? .

Both sides agreed in court yester-
day that the Unabomber suspect meets
the standards for trial. They say he
understands what’s happening, and
that he’s able to help his lawyers
defend him. 4

The judge says he’s going to
decide Thursday morning whether to
order Kaczynskito proceed’ with his

. current lawyers — or let him represent

himself.
And the judge says he plans to
proceed with the trial as early as

‘Thursday morning.

There’s still a deep rift between
Kaczynski and his lawyers. They want
to base their defense on his mental,
state —— and he doesn’t.

The judge indicated yesterday that
he may hold Kaczynski to an agree-
ment he made —— that he’d stick with
his current lawyers, if they’d promise
not to introduce expert testimony
about his mental state during the guilt
phase of the trial.

BUFFALO, N .Y. — Some police offi-

as Hispanics to get hired.

That accusation comes from the
Hispanic Law Enforcement Officers
Association of Western New York.
The group says about 10 officers may
have lied to take advantage of the
police minority hiring program.’

The group says -it should take
more than a Hispanic surname or the
ability to speak Spanish to qualify.

\ The U.S. Census Bureau defines a
Hispanic as someone whose ancestral
makeup is at least a twelfth from that
origin. .

NEW YORK —r North Atlantic

swordfish is disappearing from the

' The popular fish is one of many.
species that environmentalists say is
in danger of being fished out.

Nora_ Pouillon, part owner and
chef of two restaurants in Washington,
says she’s -noticed for years how the
swordﬁsh at the fish market have been
getting‘ smaller and smaller. She has
been signing up fellow restauranteurs
to take part in the moratorium. g

“If we don’t take it off the menu,
it’ll take itself off,”
Moonen, a New York chef.

Two environmental groups — Sea
Web and the National Resources

moratorium. The groups say the larger
goal is to focus attention on the prob-

Their actions and accomplishments speak for them-

Troy said the bike unit's importance comes ﬁom
the face-to-face contact it has with the Oakland com-
munity. . '

However, the uI1it’s real advantage is in its
mobility — exposed to the open air, able to hear and
see what goes on around them

"We see more on bikes, hear more and smell
more," said oiﬁcer Bobby Broadway, who's in his
third year in the unit ' '

This deﬁnitely matters to oﬁicers Shannon

Santucci and Sarah Skoog who, because they smelled-
and saw smoke and heard screams, saved an Oakland -

woman ﬁom the second ﬂoor of a burning apartment
building last November, according to Delaney.

Santucci found a ladder in a nearby yard and
climbed up to carry the woman to safety.

"If they’d been in a car, they wouldn't have
heard the cries for help or smelled the smoke,"
Delaney said. "Santucci is up for the FBI award for
that"

The FBI award recognizes a police oﬂicer who
exhibits unmatched. courage in the line of duty.

When the bike unit ﬁrst hit the streets in '94, there
were up to 30 panhandlers known by the police to be
on Forbes Avenue at any given time.

Broadway said the bike unit hit them "pretty
hard," convicting many and causing a big decline in
panhandling in Oakland. He said the real reason for
the decline was that the bike_ cops are easily noticed.

"On the bikes we’rehighly visible and visibility
helps to deter crime," he said. "People think anests
are the big thing for police oﬁicers, but they’re not.
Deterring crime is more important. When crime is
deterred, nobody gets hurt." 8

Troy said a bike unit oﬂicer is a cross between
the beat oﬂicer and the oﬂicer in a patrol car. He can
respond to sidewalk and ttaﬂic situations.

Broadway cited an example of a man who
ran a red light on Forbes Avenue, made a left on
to Belleﬁeld Street and started down Fifth
Avenue. Broadway cut through the Cathedral
lawn and caught the car when it stopped at a red
light on Fifth Avenue.

"The ggy was like, ‘where'd you oorne
from. "' Broadway- said "He'll think twice
before running any red lights in Oakland again."

Troy said the bike unit uses the mini-station
on Forbes Avenue as a headquarters.

It's centrally located on campus, and
because the officers ride bikes, they have the
best response time in the department.

"We can cover twice as much ground as any
beat oﬂicer...three times," Troy said.

The unit also stays in contact with the city
police.» For example, the unit often responds to
calls that come over the city police radio, usual-
ly getting to the scene before the city cars do,
according to Oﬂicer Tracey Fails.

Because they are always in the area, they
know a lot of people in Oakland on a ﬁrst—name
basis. People often stop to ask‘them about their
Cannondale bikes. _ .

"They always want to know about the dif-
ferent components ‘and parts we use,"
Broadway said. "It's just another example of the
relationship with the community." »

Broadway said he hopes that in the future
they can expand the unit to 10 oﬂicers. ' '

"We need to get some more guys in here, the
women are taking over," he joked, referring to

on the unit. "Unless they bring in some of the
Baywatch girls."

Where will it end?

DUBOULSBURG, Ca. — A scientist in California
stunned the world yesterday when he armounced his
successful cloning of lettuce leaves that taste like beef.

Ever since a researcher in Scotland successfully
cloned a sheep named “Dolly” last March, scientists
around the world have begun using the new technology

to alter animal, mineral and vegetable in the name of‘

progress.

“We began cloning guppies, but the $3 million cost
didn’t seem justiﬁed, considering we bought the origi-
nals for $.25 cents a dozen at the mall,” said California
researcher Norman Klaycher.

Numerous other cloning experiments failed for the
scientist. Thousands of cloned locusts, sea bass,
Flintstone vitamins and Tamagatchis now sit useless in
warehouse crates around Klaycher’s lab.

“If you’ve seen one, you’ve seen ‘em all,” the scien-
tist joked, nervously.

Success ﬁnally found Klaycher over an Eat’N Park
steak salad late one night. ' -

“I was sitting there, forking through my meal when
it hit me: What a waste! Why not use my cloning tech-
nology to combine the two?” '

The result —— beef-ﬂavored lettuce.

“Thanks to this alteration, their leaves should
excrete the protein bovine-4,” said Klaycher’s assistant,
Bea Kerr.

' “The next step will be taste—testing the lettuce heads.
If all goes as expected, they will be indistinguishable to
the human tongue from a New York Strip,” she added.
“In taste, if not texture.”

Officials at the US. Food and Drug Administration
said they are leery of the experimentation.

“Sounds fishy to me,” said one source at FDA head-
quarters. “We’ve heard reports of lettuce-ﬂavored beef,
but this is ridiculous!”

Klaycher has begun experimenting with other life
forms, but sofar unsuccessfully.

“We cloned a rabbit, but somehow its ears were
made of lettuce leaves,” he said. “Auto- cannibalism is
not a pretty site.”

Klaycher and his associates say they’ll soon have a
new target: Humans.

But two days ago, the FDA announced its ban on all
human cloning research without its written consent,
arguing that such experimentation involves a health risk.

“But we’re not just cloning them,” Klaycher said.
“We’re IMPROVING them. You just have to look at the
bright side of things. When has science failed us in the
past?

It’s the modern messiah.”

Instructions only for the self-explanatory

Recently, when I was fortunate
enough to visit one of these modem
all—inclusive, one-stop superstores
(you know the land: a haven where
you can conveniently purchase a
275-pound “family size” feed bag of
Cheez-Nips just three aisles away
from sport-utility vehicle undercar-

” riages), I saw a nifty little computer

gadget called a “Virtual Pet.”

The premise of this toy, through
the dynamic and somewhat mystical
manipulation of three buttons, is to
keep “alive” a virtual animal by
feeding it, cleaning up its “virtual
messes” and providing some extent
ofhealth care to it. In return, this lit-
tle egg-shaped toy is guaranteed to
provide you with several months’
worth of joy, happiness and annoy-
ing beeps. —

However, when I opted to read

the instructions for this little toy, they ‘

read something like this (and were
grammatically not much diiferent):

1) Iftoybeep threetime, hit but-
ton A twice followed by C. If beep-
ing stops, hit B three times. Ifnot, hit
B once. A. (On Tuesdays, Saumdays
and leap years, don’t forget to hit C.
Six times and B.) You have now fed
your Virtual Pet.

2) If your Virtual Pet emits a
long beep, hit button B within ﬁve
seconds. A and C. If you fail at this,
hit C four times, then A twice.
Replace battery. You have now
cleaned up your pet’s “virtual” poop.
Button C.

3) Ifyourvirtualpet sounds a
series of three short beeps, followed
by long, drawn out beep. Don’t
worry! It is transmitting and receiv-
ing the mind-control data that made
you buy it! C andB atsarne time!A!

4) Your virtual pet needs quali-
ty, individualized care. Do not use
HMO! Call doctor at 001-876-

 

S s  - Cowmﬁisr

98732-12327 from 1 to 3 p.m. Japan
time. Hit button A and C, B four
times! Good job!

And that was about it. No more
instructions. To top it off, this thing
kept beeping every half hour and
only‘ ‘slept’ ’ for about six hours each
day which is A) more sleep than
many college students get in, let’s
say, a week and B) taken at times by
the Virtual Pet when you are already
awake so that its beeping can disrupt
your wonderful night’s sleep.

Although the target audience
for these toys, the under-7 crowd (I
named mine “Bleepy”) seems to
inherently understand how to do
such technologically advanced
things as reprogram hard drives and
operate video games, I don’t. So
Bleepy went to that big discount
superstore in the sky. '

I don’t blame myself for virtual

" involuntary petslaughter as much as

the instruction book For some rea-
son everything comes with instruc-
tions these days except the things
that no one really knows how to use.

Take shampoo, for example.
The instructions are simple enough:
1) Apply to hair. 2) Work into lather.
3) Rinse. 4) Repeat. Though most
shampoo manufacturers make the
big leap—of—faith that customers will
know when to stop following step
four, they clearly explain each step
in the hair-cleansing process.

Hair spray is likewise painfully
self—explanatory in its directions: 1)
Spray on

But when it comes to the more
intricate and important facets of life,
you better hope you have A) a
degree in computer science, 2) a
Nobel prize or D) a ﬁve-year—old.

An interesting example of this is
the average computer program
instruction manual. Most of these,
though divided into easy—to—ﬁnd sec-
tions, say the same thing under each
heading: YOU DON’T HAVE A
SNOWBALL’S CHANCE IN
HELL OF UNDERSTANDING
THIS. PLEASE SHUT OFF
YOUR COMPUTER AND 'DO
THIS BY HAND OR BUY OUR
TUTORIAL MANUAL. When you
do, the tutorial says something a lot
like: “If you are trying to reformat
the mainframe’s ‘X’ drive, enter the
‘File’ menu and hit ‘A’ twice. ‘B.’
‘C’ four times!”

Maybe someday, we’ll stop and
take the time to write clear instruc-

tions. Iristructions on how to use_

voice mail, military weaponry and
Russian space stations.
Clear instructions are crucial.
Just wait until some guy in an ICBM
silo is reading maintenance instruc-
tions: 7
Nuclear Technician: “Uhh, ‘If

twice followed by C to clean nuclear
weapon of mass destruction.’ Easy
enough.” (Presses series of buttons.
Cut to distance shot of two kids
holding their virtual pets and staring
at a giant mushroom cloud where a
once-prosperous capitalist industrial
nation sat on the horizon.)

three times.”
Kid 2: “Nope.”

Course packets
not as overpriced
as they may seem

The Jan. 14 column “Textbooks:
Should Fox Mulder investigate?” passion-
ately describes the textbook dilemma facing
today’s students. And, as is apparent ﬁom
Ms. Hager’s anecdotes and as Mulder and
Scully often ﬁnd, things are not as they
appear. Speciﬁcally, comments conceming
the cost of course materials purchased at the
Copy Cat require further clariﬁcation.

For the past ﬁve years, the University
has offered an altemative to traditional text-
books. Course packets can substantially
reduce “boo ” costs for students. Instead of
requiring students to purchase more than one
textbook ﬁom which only a portion of the
text is used, course packets allow materials
—fromawidevariety ofsources——tobe
gathered and packaged as a single “cus-
tomized textbook”

As for the perceived cost of these rnate-
rials, many overlook the fact that every arti-
cle or book excerpt in every course packet
must be copyright cleared before reproduc-
tion. Each publisher whose materials are
used is paid a royalty for the right to repro-
duce the materials. The cost of copyrights
clearances, on average, for each course pack-
et runs between one-third and one—half of the
sale price.

Twice in the pages of The Pitt News —

Wednesday, April 16, 1997, “Course Packets
can help to relieve textbook costs” and the
editorial, “Course Packets are a less painful
alternative to textbooks,” —— these same stu-
dent-service, cost-reducing, curriculum-
enhancing eiforts were acknowledged

Course packets are cost-effective ways
to customize classroom materials to speciﬁc
curriculum. We understand the conoems of
students and are trying to help.

Microsoft’: unfair

In response to your Jan. 13 edi-

one thing: You have no idea what
you’re talking about.

they were investigated by the FTC
for possible collusion between
Microsoft and IBM. The FTC dead-
locked twice, so the Department of
Justice took over in 1993, this time
focusing on Microsoft’s DOS mar-
keting practices. Also in 1993, the
European Trade commission took
action because it believed its laws
were violated by Microsoft’s
restrictive licensing agreements
with computer manufacturers.
Then, in 1994, Microsoft “set-

. tled” with the DOJ, signing on to a

consent decree that forbids
Microsoft from using its operating
system dominance to destroy com-
petition. That decree is what’s in
question in the DOJ’s lawsuit. The
real questionis if the “integration”
(coding the browser and operating
system so they are tightly interwo-
ven), not “bundling” (making -it
sound like it’s just inside the same
shrink wrap) of Explorer into

done more than enough to warrant a’

Mike Tyson will be back on pay-
per-view television faster than anyone
previously thought.

He will be in the squared circle, fac-
ing a veteran opponent.

He will earn millions. His promoter
will earn more. He will be the featured
performer on a multi-bout card to be
watched by millions of crazed fans.

And, as an added bonus, Tyson will
know whether or not he’s going to win
before he even steps into the ring.

For those of you who missed last
night’s “Raw is War” on the USA

' Network or didn’t catch the wire reports

in Tuesday’s paper, it is ofﬁcial — Mike
Tyson has joined the World Wrestling
Federation.

According to those same wire

reports, Tyson will wrestle at
Wrest1eMania XIV on March 29 in
Boston.

So, the man most often accused
with destroying the image of profes-
sional boxing has been drafted into a
sport without the nagging concerns of
image, integrity, fair play or anything
else.

A sport where biting someone on

the ear is not only legal, but could be ’

encouraged, if it is in the script.

WWF promoter Vince McMahon
announced to the press shortly after
Monday’s TV show that Tyson would
not be a guest referee at the event as
originally planned. Thanks to an alterca-
tion with a professional wrestler on that
evening’s broadcast, Tyson demanded a
wrestling match.

At least, that’s the way it was
reported. There is a possibility, albeit
remote, that this altercation may have
been planned in advance.

I know it breaks a lot of wrestling
fans’ hearts, but Mr. McMahon may not
have exactly been...well...honest with
the hapless Associated Press reporters
who are used to covering basketball,

football, and other sports where winners g

are decided on the ﬁeld or, at least, in
the booths of network executives.

These reporters have followed
Tyson into the realm of sports entertain-
ment, where skill with the microphone
and the ability to take a steel chair
across the forehead counts just about as
much as athletic ability or technical
wrestling know-how.

And, if precedent serves, it will be
tough for Tyson to ever leave with any

Augsburg shocks Panther matmen

Division-III power; No. 3 Penn State beat Pitt at National Duals

Brian Knavish

Staff Writer

The season was going too smooth-
ly. -
The 11th-ranked Panther wrestling
team was cruising through its schedule
like a Corvette down a country high-
way.

But the country highway turned
into a Pittsburgh alley as the wrestlers
hit a major pothole at this weekend’s
National Duals Tournament at the
University of Iowa. -

The Panthers dropped their only
two matches at the prestigious dual-
meet tournament.

The ﬁrst was a 23-15 heartbreaker
against nationally-ranked Penn State.
The second was an 18-16 disappoint-
ment against Augsburg, the NCAA
Division-HI national champs from
Minnesota.

“We didn’t fare as well as we had
hoped,” Head Coach Rande Stottlemyer
said. “It’s not a performance we can
hang our hats on, but now we have to
put this weekend behind us and move
on with the rest of the season.”

The ‘Nationals is among the most
prestigious regular season wrestling
tournaments. Only the most elite teams

in the country receive an invitation to
compete.

The top eight teams are seeded
according to rankings, and the remain-
ing eight teams are ﬁlled in randomly.
Pitt had the misfortune of drawing third-
seeded Penn State in the first round —
the same Penn State squad that upset
ﬁrst ranked Iowa at home a few weeks
back. 1

Butthe Panthers have the talent to

wrestle with the likes of Penn State.
They proved this by ﬁnishing a whop-
ping 23 points ahead of the Nittany
Lions on their wayto winning the Lock
Haven Invitational earlier this season.
The Panthers kept .the match "rea-
sonably close, and even after minor-
decision victories by Rob Loper at the

Hockey fires away, but
fails to sink Midshipmen

Rachel Lenzi

Staff Writer _

The Pitt hockey team kept
shooting and shooting Monday
afternoon, but the puck couldn’t
ﬁnd its way into the net when it
counted the most.

Monday’s 3-2 loss to the
U.S. Naval Academy’s “B”
team marked a small para-

’mount of sorts: The Panthers

registered their highest shot
total of the season, outshooting
the opposition 39-36.

“Good things happen when
you shoot,” commented Head
Coach Wade Chouinard. “I
think that at any time the team
has to shoot. That’s the key to
scoring. If you can’t shoot it,

you can’t score.”

The shooting game is just a
fraction of the improvements
the Panthers have made since
the beginning of the season — a
beginning which was marred
by injuries, departures from the
squad and a number of double-
digit losses. » '

.“I think a lot of these
improvements have come from
the fact that the team had some
problems at the start of the sea-
son, with players and coaches,”
Chouinard explained. “We’ve
resolved all those problems and
eliminated them and we’re
hockey players now —- guys
that want to give their heart and
soul to this team.”

And even though the

Panthers couldn’t chalk up their

Panther men outswim West Virginia, UMBC in weekend action  

Jay Yander
For The Pitt News

Even though it was on the road, the
Pitt men’s swimming and diving team
felt right at home in the West Virginia
University Pool on Saturday, as records
fell and expectations rose.

The men’s swim team handed West
Virginia and the University of Maryland-
Baltimore County 82 and 131 point loss-
es, respectively, at WVU on Saturday
afternoon. ’

Pitt’s 200-yard medley relay team of
Adam Kotkiewicz, Joe Stone, Jon
Haggerty and Jerry Koller broke the
WVU pool record with a time of 1:34.52.
A second relay team of Eric Stefanski,

Andy Cherep, Brian Elko _and Noah
Caplan also swam under the pool record
but ﬁnished second to their teammates.

“We’re very excited about the
record-setting weekend,” said Head
Coach Chuck Knoles. “Not just one relay
team, but two teams did it.”

The dual meet was a much-needed
competition as well as win for the
Panthers, since their last competitive
meet was back in November — almost
two months ago.

“I was very pleased with our ﬁrst win
of the season, being that it was our first
competition since November,” Knoles
said.

It was the first ever meeting between
Pitt and UMBC, but as the score reﬂects,

there were no surprises for the Panthers
— something Knoles was glad about.

“You always like to know something
about your opponent before you compete
against them,” Knoles said. “Nonnally,
we have an idea of who we’re about to
swim against.”

Sophomore Jerry Koller had a busy
yet successful meet by winning two indi-
vidual events — the 50-yard freestyle
and the 100-yard freestyle — and taking
part in the record-breaking 200-yard
medley relay victory.

Although injured with a bruised

hamstring, freshman Devin Meece

claimed a victory for ‘himself and for Pitt

with a first place ﬁnish in the 200-yard
breaststroke. “I like to see underclass-

men like Meece contribute to the team,”
Knoles said. “He’s even swimming with
a bad leg.”

The Pitt divers fared just as well with
victories by George “Andy” Anderson in
both the one- and three—meter spring-

board competitions.

“Andy really had a great day of div-
ing,” Knoles said. “That success should
continue for him.”

, The Panthers return to the water this
Saturday at 1 p.m. when they play host to

' Big East nemesis Villanova at Trees Pool.

Pitt will then travel to Boston to face
Harvard in a non-conference meet on
Saturday, Jan. 30. Pittsburgh Panthers
swimming and diving meets at Trees
Pool are free to students.

Glenn Pritzlaff, Pitt trailed 1-5-9 heading
into 177. ‘

But All-American John Withrow‘

came through in a huge way. He record-
ed a pin with 20 seconds left in the bout
to bolt the Panthers ahead 16-15 with fel-
low "All-American Mark Bodo coming
up next. ' _

“'I‘hat’s the position we wanted to be

in heading into 190. Bodo’s been Mr.

Consistency for us,” Stottlemyer said.
“But it was one of those freak things. He
lost 3-2 and that really killed us.”

The loss put Penn State up 19-15
heading into the ﬁnal match-up of the
evening. With the Panthers trailing by
four, heavyweight Matt Mueller was in a
position where he needed either a pin or
a technical fall for Pitt to win.

Forcing Mueller to wrestle in a total-

ly different style than nonnal, he ended,

up dropping that match, leaving the final
score 23-15 in favor of the Nittany Lions.
The disappointing loss to Penn State
left the team emotionally down for its
consolation match against Augsburg —— a
very solid team, but certainly a team that
the 11th-ranked team in Division I
should beat. . r‘
Freshman Blaise, filling in for an
injured Chad Jesko, picked up a victory
at 134, as did Loper (126), Mengerink
(167)§W1throw (177), and Bodo (190).
But without their heads in the match,
the victories weren’t enough as the
Panthers dropped the match 18-16, elim-
inating them from the tournament.
“Obviously this isn’t going to help
us [in the rankings],” Stottlemyer said.
“But the good thing is we get a chance to

_ redeem ourselves.

“We wrestle. six ranked teams the
rest of the season. That will be a good
way for us to tell where we’re at. It’s pos-

sible we could win them all or we could.’

lose them all.” j

The Panthers take to the mat again
on Saturday, hosting Ohio State at the
Fitzgerald Field House at noon. -

Once again the women’s swim
team is continuing to show that the rig-
orous training program Coach Marian
Cassidy—Keen has put them through is
indeed paying off.

‘This past weekend, the Panthers
faced three opponents in three days.
All three meets were away from the
comfort of Trees Hall.

Being the visiting team isn’t easy,
but the women didn’t let that slow
them down. The Lady Panthers won
two of the three meets.

“Everyone swam pretty well, but
it’s kind of hard right now because

i  _Tl-lpEy.PlT"l'. news

Women's swimming takes two of thre

we’re in transition from training really
hard to competing,” said Co—Captain
Melissa Burns.

The women started their tour on
Friday in West Virginia. They faced
both West Virginia University and the
University of Maryland-Baltimore
County (UMBC) on Friday and
Saturday.

Victory was easy for the Lady
Panthers as evidenced by the final
scores. They defeated WVU by a score
of 162.50 to 80.50 and UMBC by a
whopping 187 to 56.

Pitt’s Jennifer Slack and Megan
McNallen proved their hard training
paid off by placing first and second,

 

freestyle. ,

Samantha Chabotar placed first in
both the 400—yard individual medley
and 500—yard freestyle race.

“Chabotar swam really well for us
both days,” Burns said.

Altogether, the Lady Panthers
came in first in 10 separate events.

While Friday and Saturday’s meets
were important, Burns feels that the
team didn’t compete the same way
against WVU and UMBC as they did
against Penn State on Sunday —-— a
meet that the Panthers lost.

“People kind of swam different
events on [Friday and Saturday]. We
didn_’t'put in our best line up against
them,” stated Burns.

 

e, loses to Penn State

Penn State was a quality test for
the women, and a chance for the swim-
mers to square off against old friends.

“It’s always a fun meet for us
because a lot of us swam against the
same girls in high school,” said
McNallen.

The fact that Penn State is a Big
Ten team gets the Panthers fired up,
including Coach Cassidy—Keen.

“Marian was excited, then we got
excited [to face Penn State]. You step it
up a notch. You take it to a different
level,” McNallen said.

The women’s next opponent is
Cleveland State on Friday Jan. 23 in

Cleveland, followed by a meet against V

Villanova Saturday, Jan. 24 at home.

credibility.

In June of 1976, Muhammad Ali
fought Japanese wrestler Antonio Inoki
in a boxing—versus-wrestling match. It
ended in a time-lirnit draw.

Ali went 5-3 in the boxing ring after
the match. It was near the end of his
career, and to say he’d lost his quick-
ness would be like saying Tyson has lost
his pristine public image. The match
was a pure publicity stunt, and it helped
to mark the downturn of Ali’s career.

In 1995, Lawrence Taylor entered
the wrestling ring, taking on Bam Bam
Bigelow at WrestleMania XI. He won,
and was never heard from again, mak-
ing one major public appearance (at Phil
Simms’ jersey retirement ceremony)
between his wrestling match and his
recent drug conviction.

Strange as it may seem, being con-
nected to a wrestling promotion hasn’t
done wonders for the careers of many
individuals.

Tyson will be no exception.. While
many thought his career hit a low point
with the ear-biting incident, you haven’t
seen anything until Mike Tyson laces up
his wrestling boots to join the ranks of
Doink the Clown, Duke the Dumpster,
the Honky Tonk Man and Big Van
Vader.

Oh, and don’t forget “Stone Cold”
Steve Austin, his reported opponent for
the extravaganza. Austin is the current
media darling of the WWF, cutting
spots for MTV’s Super Bowl halftime
show and making other more main-
streamvappearances.

Austin is well over 30, partially par-
alyzed —— ‘ thanks to an in—n'ng neck
injury —— and has based his recent fame
on using foul language in interviews.

Truly, a quality opponent for the
champ. A —

second win of the season, the improvement
in each aspect of the game was almost dia-
matic. Controlling the puck around the
Panther end of the ice, ﬁnishing off hits and
settling down the tempo of the game has
allowed Pitt to make an impact in the game,
rather than ﬁnd themselves down by four or
ﬁve goals after the first period.

And Pitt hasn’t given up, either. Pitt
tied the game at 1-1 on Dave Konn’s unas-

defenseman picked up his pace and led the

our roster.”

_ But the Panthers fell asleep early in the
second period, when the Midshipmen
notched two goals in 14 seconds. The sec-
ond goal, scored immediately after the end
of a Pitt power play, was the backbreaker
for the Panthers." After being released from
the penalty box, Navy’s Brian Vogel skated
in alone, took a pass ﬁom Dave Hickey and
fired the puck high on Kenny’s glove side
for the second Navy tally.

Preventing those two goals could have
been the key to getting the Panthers’ second
win of the season, but Kenny was just
happy with the improvement of his defense.

“From playing two games ago against
Kent State, they had 83 shots against,”
Kenny said. “From the last game, against
Maiyland, they had 45 shots against. The
defense has stood really tall and they played
really well, kept Navy’s quality shots down
to ﬁve or six a game, they kept all the shots
to the point and those are the ones you gotta
save.”

Defenseman Adam Smith moved up to
forward for the game — part of
Chouinard’s line—shuﬂling strategy —— and
scored a power play goal under ﬁve min-
utes into the third period to ignite hopes of
a late—game Pitt rally. But the Midshipmen
hung onto the win, dropping Pitt’s record to
1-11.

Afterward, Smith expressed the ﬁlls-
trations of putting in the elfort and not reap-
ing the beneﬁts. .

“Except for that second period, we’re

hustling a lot more  but I really don’t '

know. We’re playing well but we could be
playing a lot better. That’s it. That’s all there
is to it.”

On paper, the Pitt men’s and women’s

. track teams have had better days.

In reality, last weekend’s Doug

 Raymond Invitational went pretty well for
I the Panthers. A horde of young athletes

stepped up to show that Pitt’s successful

: future might be here sooner than anticipated.

Part of the reason for youth stealing the

. show was that several more experienced
' Panthers didn’t make the trip to Kent State.

Middle—distance runners Rich Walsh, Scott
Curry and Amy Francy stayed home, as did

’ the defending national champion in the long

jump, Trecia Smith. They rested for next

~ weekend’s meet at Virginia Tech.

In the meantime, Kianga Lee and Gina

‘ Bundy picked up the slack. Lee won the 60-
~ meter hurdles in 8.96 seconds. Bundy, along

with Ayana -Coleman, Iesha Rainey and
Nina Carter, won the 4x400-meter relay in a
time of 3:55.31.

Pitt Head Coach Steve Lewis was
impressed with the performance.

“Ifboth the men and the women went to
the [regional championship] meets next

week, I think they could place in the top"

three,” Lewis said.
In the pentathlon, Bundy and Lee ﬁn-
ished second and third. Bundy’s total of

1 3,312 points was just 12 away from qualify-

ing for the ECAC meet. Vifith their perfor-
mances, Bundy and Lee now have the third-
and fourth-best pentatlilon scores in the East
region. In ﬁrst and second place are two
more Pitt athletes, Smith and Coleman.

The best event for the men this season is
shaping up to be the 400 meters. The men’s
4x400-meter relay team of Jeremy Ward,

. Tim Tyre, Jack J eﬂieys and Gregg Blake ran

its fastest time of the year, 3: 17.33, earning it

only a second place spot.

“We’re still putting that team together,”
Lewis said. “That was our fastest time of the
year and our two fastest quarter-milers sat
and watch .”

Those two men, Sekou Dilday and Carl
Taylor, were too‘ busy running the 400
meters individually to take part in the relay.
Dilday ﬁnished second in 48.81 seconds,
and Taylor was fourth in 49.73. Both quali-
ﬁed for the IC4A championship meet. ,

The men were impressive in the 60-
meter hurdles, ﬁnishing second, third and
fourth. Arantes Lewin ﬁnished second in
8.18 seconds, Jeifneys was right behind in
8.21 and Ward was fourth in 8.27.

This meet was largely preparation for
next week’s meet, which will feature the best
competition Pitt has seen all year.

“Twenty of the best schools in the East
will be there,” Lewis said. “We’re going to
see who we can get qualiﬁed for the nation-
al championships there.”

Streaking down the nmway to ﬂy
through the air, Lisa Fronhofer made the
vault look as easy as ordering a late—night
pizza.

A few minutes later, teammate
Danielle “Freddie” Alba had an good per-
formance on the uneven parallel bars
exciting the crowd.

Wrapping up the meet was Erika
Flamer on the ﬂoor exercise. The music
was playing loud, and the gymnast got to
show her energy and enthusiasm.

Despite‘ these individual efforts, the
team came up short against West Virginia,
losing 192.025 to 187.875 in its\season-
opener at the Fitzgerald Field House on ‘
Sunday.

Despite ﬁrst-meet jitters, the girls
stayed focused. The gyrrmasts had their
share of falls, but they. kept the meet
close. .

“Our ﬁrst meet wasn’t great, but it
wasn’t bad either,” said Coach Debbie
Yohman. “The kids went hard for things.”

Falling ﬁom the uneven parallel bars,
freshman Colleen Crisi remained calm,
got back on and had an excellent routine.
This was just one example of how deter-
mined this squad is about its perfor-
mances,-according to Coach Yohman.

   

‘Take our mistakes and improve on
them,” said senior Tracy Brown, who
competed in the vault. Brown had a rough
week in practice and was happy to get the
team’s ﬁrst meet under its belt.

Alba participated in all four events of
the day, even though she was not feeling
well. She had a’ hard time on her ﬂoor
exercise, where she had a couple of falls.
Yohman called the performance
“extremely uncharacteristic” for the
Panther standout.

The absence Janet Highhill helped

‘keep the meet close. She was unable to

perform on the uneven bars due to an
inioor ‘ .
The team has been plagued with

injuries this season. Yohman wasn’t sure '

how the squad’s rotation order was going
to go until about two weeks before the
season. Despite this, the team has been
able to establish some depth and has one
or two extra people healthy on top of the
nomral ﬁve in each event.

The team is looking ahead to this
Saturday when it will host Ursinus and
Missouri at 8 pm. at the Fitzgerald Field
House. Team members expressed excite-
ment about the Missouri matchup, since
the Panthers usually only face the Tigers
at Missouri in the CALI‘ Classic. Home-
gym advantage may prove the difference
for the Panthers. ' -
