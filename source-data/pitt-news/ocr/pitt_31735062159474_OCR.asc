Police are still seeking the ab-
ductor of Mrs. Marjorie Weller,
graduate nurse and a senior in the
School of Public Nursing. Mrs.
Weller was forced into a wild auto
ride through the Pittsburgh district
by an unidentified man on Jan. 11.

The man stuck a pistol into Mrs.
Wel1er’s back and forced her into
her car as she prepared to go home
after a night class at McGee Hospi-
tal. After threatening to strangle
her to stop her from screaming, the
man drove off keeping Mrs. Weller
covered with his gun.

During the ride through Oakland,
Schenley Park, Herron Hill, and
Bloomfield Mrs. Weller fought off
the advances of her attacker. She
finally escaped by jumping out of
the car at a red light.

WSGA Commission Votes

On Women ’s Election ule

WSGA Commission voted to seid
a recommendation to the executive
committee to publish nominees’
names for women's election “less
than a week before elections”Wed-
nesday evening at their monthly
meeting. '

This vote climaxed weeks of
debate on the question of when
WSGA should publish the names of
nominees. The debate centered‘ in
the executive committee and Com-
mission meetings, but spread out
to all of women's organizations
represented on Commission. The
final vote, therefore, was in reality
the recommendation of the women
students as a whole.

Betty Bolger, president of WSGA,
opened the meeting by stating the
ballot as follows:Will you consider
carefully the best time for publish-
ing the nominees names? Do you
recommend as a policy that they
should be published!

1. one day before elections‘ accord-

ing to the existing system.

2. less than a week before elec-

tions.

3. a week before elections.

4. longer, and if so how much

longer.

The final vote, taken at the end
of the meeting, came out as follows:
nine members favored keeping the
existing system: 22 favored an-
nouncingi the names less than a

{week before elections; six favored

announcing the names a week be-
fore elections; and no one favored
announcing the names further ahead
than one week.

The President reminded the
members before they cast their
ballot, that their recommendation

could not be followed this year
since the Easter holidays, pre-
ceeding elections , prevents such

a policy.

M Rejects Proposal
To Stop ‘Double Duty’

‘In a surprisin-g‘development, Men’s Council rejected the proposed
amendment which would have eliminated the possibility of candidates
being nominated to both Council and Student Congress.

Though the amendment passed
unanimously at the previous meet-
ing, unexpectedly strong arguments
ca ed seven members to vote
against
to 7 in favor of the amendment

Nelson Cites Weakness

During the discussion, Roy Nelson
brought out that the proposal would
present an artificial restriction on
the seeking of office. Some men
are capable of holding more than
one important office, and the num-
ber of positions a man seeks should
depend only on his confidence in
his ability to fill them well, said
Nelson.

Jim Morton, who proposed the
amendment, said, "There are-plenty
of men outside of this group who
could do a good job here if they
had the chance to enter Council.
There's no reason then for positions
to be held by a relatively small
number of men.”

Another constitutional amendment
ruling out candidates who will not
be able to serve at least two sem-
esters on Council was passed.

By-laws Change Postponed

Council tabled a proposed change
in the by-laws which would ask for
the resignations of members who
also belong to Student Congress.
This change, proposed by Jim
Morton, is distinct from the de-
feated amendment, since that affects
only nomination.

Students Lose
Six Days

Mid-term vacation this year will
begin Feb. 3, with students report-
ing back to class Monday, Feb. 13.
Since the Christmas and Easter
vacations of this term have both
been lengthened, there will be six
less days between semesters than
there were last year.

Exams will be given from Friday,
Jan. 2'7 through Thursday, Feb.~v2.

Registration for the spring set.nes*'-, .

ter will start with the seniors re-
porting to the Syria Mosque on
Feb. 8. Juniors, Sophomores, and
Freshmen will follow on Feb. 9,
10, and ’l5‘7l in that order.‘

 

Don Ewart raised the question
of student representation. He wished
to know if student opinion was to
be considered by the Building Com-
mittee before the final plans were
drawn.

‘No Further Progress’

"Until the general outer plan of
the building is decided on, there is
no need to call a committee now,”
Dean Biddle said.x"Since Dean
(Helen P.) Rush and I have met
with the student leaders to dis-
cuss the plans last fall, there has
been no further progress on the
building.”

The present plans call for the
erection of the five-story structure
(three~ above ground) facing the
quadrangle, which is the campus
lawn between the Cathedral and‘
Heinz Chapel. Dean Biddle said./J
the proposed Clapp Hall, library,
and gymnasium will also face the
quadrangle as Heinz Chapel andl
Cathedral now do.

A tunnel will ‘connect the base-
ment of the Student Center with
Cathedral and gym. The gymnasium
is to be constructed along theBelle-
field street side of the campus. . p

The center ground floor is planned
to house game and meeting rooms,
gym locker room, and a snack bar.

Huge Lobby Planned  A

 
        
 

A huge lobby, which could be

converted into a social ‘room ac--

it. The final vote was 9 ‘

Other developments at Tuesday's
meeting included Council’s accept-
ance of Joe Wolfe's orientation
evaluation report. The main feature
of the report, recommendation of
dink-wearing on the ground floor
and in the halls, is subject to ad-
ministration approval.

Roy Nelson disclosed that he
received a reply from the Chan-
cellor concerning the use of Room
817 as a men's lounge. Dr. Fitz-
gerald, wrote that Men’s Council
should
plan with the Dean of Men’s office
and then make recommendations to
him.

To Choose Workshop Committee

Don Ewart reported on Student
Congress’ idea for a "high school
student government workshop” to
be planned by Congress, Council
and FWSGA. Bill Blockstein sug
gested that, since Council is con-
cerned only with the men students
of the University, Congress under-
take their workshop alone.

After a flurry of tabling motions
and counter-motions, Council de-
cided to set up acommittee to work
with Congress and WSGA on the
workshop.

Driver Cleared
In Bus Accident

Raymond Allen, University bus
driver, was cleared of all blame
in the death of Leon Ladd, the boy
who died on Dec. 12 after being
struck by the bus at Gate three of
the Stadium.

Allen told police he did not
notice the boy before the accident,
which occurred as he was turning
the bus around.

He said he thought the boy must
have been hitching a ride up the
hill.

exam schedule, including excep-

Dr. Ferguson also went on re-

and said the pmcedure was un-
necessary for an organization of *-
this kind. “

that the latter course, which Council is pursuing, is the proper

By DICK .KovAR  '

Pitt News Managing Editor

Mr. Blandings has nothing on
Pitt's Chancellor Rufus Fitzgerald.
Dr. Fitzgerald is currently invol-
ved in building a multi-million dol-
lar Dream University, and the
problems involved are infinitely
more exasperating and far less
humorous than the harassed home-
builder of bestseller and boxoffice
fame. ‘

The University head took time
out a few days ago to share his
hopes and headaches with some
students at an informal gathering
in his office, as Dean Theodore
Biddle had done two days previous-
ly «at a Student Congress meeting.

Out of the two discussions and
a private interview with Dean
Biddle, this writer has been able
to piece together enough tentative
conclusions to report on Pitt’s cam-
pus of tomorrow.

Trip Into Future

Taking an imaginary rocket jaunt
into the future and hovering some
2000 feet above Oakland, this ,is
what an observer might see, based
on present developments:

Up on Fifth Avenue and above,"
there’s a medical center, branching
out around the familar three-section
center of 1950. New wings are
sticking out at all angles from the
old hospital group, and new build-
ings dot the landscape around it.
The whole layoutlooks something
like a modern, resurrected Vienna,
the historical medical center of
the world.

Cathedral lawn. now diminished to
a large square of green surrounded
on all sides by Gothic buildings,
attention focuses on the main cam-
pus. Along Fifth Avenue stretches
the George Hubbard Clapp Science

Hall, blank walls guarding its
laboratories from the clamor of the
street, while spacious windows
look o'ut on the inner quadrangle.

Over on Bellefield St., but facing
in, as all the buildings do, is an
expansive gym, connected under-
ground with the Cathedral “by a
long corridor lined with lockers.
Down on Forbes St. is a large
library, augmenting those still
housed in the Cathedral.

wishing to move them inside, were
going to present the pre-game and
half-time shows next football
season.

If the rumor is true then they
-deserve the room, just as the band
deserves it if they ,are expected to
perform. The bridge fiends are also
entitled to a little insight into
'what they are getting into next fall.

First, there is a grand *«.and
glorious week at camp. Of Course,-
it is a bit chilly. Many of us slept
in quilted sleeping bags with all
our clothes on. There was running
Water--all of it ice cold. One thing,
they would have time to play cards,
after 10:30 p.m., when evening
rehearsal is finished.

Shaky Finesse

The card sharks can also look
forward to a 15 hour jaunt to
Chicago via bus. Those reclining
chairs are real comfortable, if
you’re still in the embryonic stage
of development. ‘If you're the type
that likes to stretch out while
sleeping, the modern buses have
just the place for you. Only thing
wrong is that the spot was origin-
ally designed for luggage. On the
bus the card players will have a
chance to participate in their

This is the third in a series concerning llen’s Council’s pro-
posal to make over room 817, now used as a class room and band
rehearsal room, into a men’s recreational lounge.

I would like to extend an apology to Men’s Council. At the
time of my previous writings, I had not heard the rumor that the
paste-board fanatics, now using the tables outside room 817 and

sport. Bouncing along at 60 miles
per hour and playing on an upturned
suitcase makes for a real interest-
ing game.

The “ Vie w”

Of (course, the job doeshave
some good points. If you can
manage to dodge capes thrown
from the demonstration block and
at the same time see around the
assortment of photographers, man-
agers, well-wishers and hangers-on
that clutter up the sidelines, you
can watch the football games for
nothing..

If the characters suffering from
card-'itus still entertain the idea of
performing at these Saturday after-
noon football sessions, I’m. sure
the band will be glad to trade with
them. It will be a relief to sit and
watch a football game without
worrying what music you’re going
to play, what formations you’re
going to do and what yard—line
you're supposed to be on.

If they think twice about it, and
decide the hall is just as con-
venient as room 817 for card-play-
ing, the band will again prepare to
show Ohio State what a good band
looks like.

down for a floor-by-floor inspection
of this building.

It’s evening, and groups of gaily-
dressed students are walking out of
the Cathedral to the quadrangle
and into the center. There's Phyl-
lis Beck, painfully lifting her high
heels and long skirts up three
flights of stairs to the top floor
ballroom. Back in 1950, Phyllis
complained about the lack of ele-
vator service (only one freight
lift) in the proposed center. A

We’ll look modestly away as Pat
Leix races up another flight of
stairs to the ladies’ room. Pat also
complained about the fact that
men’s and women's lounges are
located on alternate floors.

While some couples dance in the
spacious starlight ballroom, others
are enjoying the spring air out on
the broad flagstoned patio lying
between the center and the gym,
while still more are relaxing and
enjoying a snack prepared in one
of the four kitchens while sitting
in the third floor lounge.

Coffee Conferences

Down on the second floor, in
conflict with University social
regulations, various clubs and
activities groups are meeting in
the club rooms, also enjoying a
light snack carried from the serving
kitchen. Bridge games are in pro-
gre ss at various‘ corners.

On the ground, or lobby floor,
students attending the various
events are entering from the quad-
rangle, stopping to greet each
other all over the broad floor.

On the lower level, students are
working in the arts and crafts
rooms,while Pitt shutterbugs deve-
lop and print their latest master-
pieces‘ in the large darkrooms lo-
cated there. Sandwiches, coffee
and pie carried from the long snack
bar are greatly in evidence. ‘

All floors are designed for mul-
tiple-purpose use by various groups
and for a multitude of activities.
During the day, Student Congress,
‘-.‘.en's Council, and WSGA met for
luncheon meetings at the same time
as the Canterbury Club and the
YPJCA Monday lunch, while smaller
groups of students gathered for
bull sessions over their lunches.
During the afternoon there was a
movie on the top floor, a tea dance
on another floor, and a Canasta
tournament on still another.

No Bowling Alleys

Ping-pong games rage furiously
all day, but there are no bowling
alleys or billiard tables mainly
because these facilities are avail-
able commercially over on Craig St.

The lavatory facilities are as
adequately located as any found
in the average home, and the in-
stallation of elevators is prohibi-
tive both in cost and space.

Large dances, like the Military
Ball and Spring Festival Balls,
will, unfortunately, have to be held
elsewhere, possibly just across
the court in the gym. ,

Otherwise, the whole thing looks
pretty good, as good as can be had
under present and expected build-
ing conditions. We’ll continue to

the work progresses.

SCIFOLARS’ LUERARY--The Darlington Memorial Library, located on
the sixth floor, has one of the most valuable collections of books in
Western Pennsylvania. This beautiful room, which is used mainly for
research work into colonial history, contains many rate first editions.

  Valued Books Highlight
Darlington Library

By JACK MARKOWITZ

The average Pitt student has never ventured beyond the iron-
gated vestibule of the Darlington Memorial Library, though un-
doubtedly many have been curious about the contents of that

rather awesome chamber.

Famous for" its valuable collection of old books and manu-
scripts, the Darlington Library pro-
vides a sanctuary for scholars,
But most students who would_like
to browse are driven away by the
decidedly under-populous look of
the room visible through the glass

doors.

Actually, the Darlington Room
is used continuously by students of
colonial history and by others with
research problen at
hand. The room was not designed,
however, for browsers or for others
who would take advantage of the
almost tomb-like silence to finish
a term paper or study for a major.

And yet, a visit to the room is
certainly rewarding. Actually the
library comprises a suite of rooms.

thick ones and delicately bound,
pocket-sized ones--all distinctive
in some way. There are no latest

teenth of March, but according

The Players have cut the many
characters in the play down to ap-
proximately 22 men and two women.
These characters will wear Eliza-
bethan costumes rather than Roman
dress. This is due to the fact that
there are many mentions of Eliza-
bethan dress in the play and that
Shakespeare himselfdidit that way.
Also, Elizabethan costumes, which
are used more frequently than Roman
ones for the play, help the dramatic
action.

There will be 13 scene changes
involving simple sets. There will
be only one intermission.

The stage will be divided into
two parts. The right side will rep-
resent Caesar and theleft side will
V“ L ' A be Brutus’ part. Four columns will
be an the stage. The position of
these columns will indicate which
side has the more power. When
Caesar is strong the columns will
be on his side of the stage and
when Brutushascontrol,thecolumns
will move to his portion.

 

Lighting will play a big part in
creating psychological effects.

The week following the regular
production, the Players will take
the show on aroad tour to surround-
-»i—ng towns, according to Harvey J.
Pope, director.

The announcement of the cast
will appear in next week's News.

Local Sorority
Goes National

Sigma Delta Tau, a national
sorority, officially became a part
of Pitt’s greek world on Jan. 15
when 44 pledges and alumni were
initiated into its 27th chapter,
Alpha Zeta, at the Bellefield Dwell-
ings.

The girls initiated had been
pledges of Sigma Delta Tau since
last spring, when the local chapter
on campus since 1946, received an
affirmative answer to their petition
for membership.

A good many first editions have‘
been printed since the Messrs.
Martius laboriously set their type,
and a good many of those first
editions now repose of the shelves
of the quiet side-rooms and in the
glass-doored Cases of the green-
walled main room.

And the great majority of the
books in the Darlington Library
were collected by two men-William
McCullough Darlington and his
son O’Hara. Both men were schol-
ars and travelers, and during their
lives they succeeded in amassing
this valuable collection.

Darlington's Library Extensive

At one time, their library at
Guyasuta, the Darlington family’s
residence near the present site of
Aspinwall, was the most extensive
west of the Alleghenies.

The collection was given to the
University in 1918 by Mary O’Hara
Darlington and Edith Darlington
Ammon, sisters of O’Hara.

Sorority officers attending the
initiation were Mrs. Ben Kartman,

man, national committee chairman,
and regional advisors Miss Lois
Schloss and Miss Dulcy Pepinski.

After the initiation the sorority
members attended a formal dinner
at the.Schenley Hotel.

Lists Discussion

The Graduate English Club will
hold the fourth in a series of criti-
cal panels of graduate-student an
faculty experts Jan. 23, at 8 p.m.
in 149 Cl.

Subject of the panel will be
Isabel Boltlon’s novel "Do I Wake
of Sleep,” considered by many
critics to be one of the most im-
portant novels to appear in years.

Speakers on Monday night's panel
will be Professor Lawrence Lee,
Miss Helen-Jean Moore, Emrys
Evans, Montgomery Culver Jr., and
John Reilly.

In former panels, Harry Schwalb,
president of the Graduate English
Club, headed a discussion of a
c curt scene in "Antony and Cleo-
patra.7’ Two sessions were devoted
to Karl Shapiro’s "The Interlude,”
in which disagreement by the critics
was matched by almost physical
disagreement among members of
the audience.

In February, the panel will dis-
cuss "Death of a Salesman,” by
Arthur Miller, which will be per-
formed at the Nixon Theatre some-
time during the month.

BISHOP BROWN
Elected Head

Retail Head
Made Officer

Bishop Brown, director of the
Research Bureau for Retail Train-‘
ing, has been elected president of
the American Collegiate Retailing
Association. Charles M. ‘Edwards,
dean of New York University's
School of Retailing, the retiring
president,‘made the announcement

Monday. ‘
Professor Brown attended Har-
vard, and is a graduate of Dart-

mouth, where he received his bach-
elor of arts degree. He has been at
Pitt for 20 years, and has been
director of the Bureau for Retail
Training for 15 years.

The election of Marshall College.
Huntington, West Virginia, and
Bradley University, Peoria, Illi-
nois, as members of the Associa-
tion was also announced by Dean
Edwards, who serves as chairman
of the public relations committee.

The maintaining and elevating
of the standards of instruction
among schools and colleges offer-
ing courses in retailing, and the
broadening and diversifying of
the retailing curriculum now offered
by schools and colleges, is the
aim of the American Collegiate
Retailing Association.

Holds °Chat’

A frank discussion ofthe Univer-
sity’s building program marked the
first Chancellor’s fireside chat of
1950, heldin Dr. Rufus Fitzgerald’s
office Wednesday afternoon.

Speaking informally to a group
of‘about twenty students, Dr. Fitz-
gerald outlined the proposed e'xpan-
sion project and summed up pro-
gress to date. He illustrated his
remarks with architect's models of
the projected Cathedral campus and
the Medical Center.

Sponsored by Senior Court of
WSGA, the conference was notable
in }that the majority of the students
attending were unaffiliated with
any major campus activity.

The two-hour gathering developed
into a question—and-answer period,
with the students firing queries as
fast as the Chancellor could answer
them. Most of the questions con-
cerned various phases of the build-
ing program, and all were answered
with complete Caﬂdoh

Students attending were chosen
from the first signatures registered
at the Student Desk last Friday and
Monday. This policy has replaced
the former method of inviting stu-
dents at random being moredemo-
cratic and allowing for better repre-
sentation of student interests.

PiKA’s Nip
Phi Delts
In Thriller

The Fraternity League produced
its usual kind of do-or-die basket-
ball Tuesday evening in Trees
gym-

The two teams that engaged in
the scrap were the PiKA's and the
Phi Delta Thetas. At the close,
the PiKA’s were happily licking
their wounds, for they were on the
top end of a 36-34 score.

The encounter not only produced
many exciting plays but also many
dirty ones.

The first half saw Joe Scalzo
of the PiKA’s lead his teammates

in team play and shooting, but
only to be matched by the Phi
Delts’ Bob Grigsby, and as a re-

sult the second quarter ended in
a 20-all tie.

Two inspired teams came at each
others throats the next quarter. Al
Locknikar being gifted with a hot
hand for a few brief moments paced
the PiKA’s, but the Phi Delts
tightened, then continued their
point-raising and held a one point
lead at three quarters.

Air-tight defenses were then set
up by both teams, the result of
which was a mere seven points
scored combined. As the final gun
neared, an overtime was in pros-
pect. But Marty Kohr of the PiKA's
got the ball and flashed it to Lock-
nikar who sunk the game winning
basket.

Ellsugprth Rolls

Another team proved Monday
night that the YMCA Eagles will
have a difficult fight to win the
intramural National League crown.
This team is the Ellsworth Five
who trampled the Alpha Kappa Psi,
58-10.

Having won their initial game

by forfeit and losing another in
the same manner, the Ellsworth
sophomores finally displayed the

fine form which they are capable
of.

Pumping in 34 points in the first
half, Ellsworth showed accurracy
and brilliant backboard play, with
Gabriel Ferraro racking 16 points
in that half. The Psi’s were held
to a mere six points.

The second half was the same
routine with Ellsworth holding
their opponents to four points,while
they themselves were scoring 24.

Leading the scorers were two
definite standout performers, Fer-
raro, with 24 points, and Norm
Figura, 12 points.

Ministry Answers Pitt’s
Prayers for Material

By DON HURDOCK
The ministry is answering Pitt’s

prayers for bigger and better basket-

ball players.

For Arthur Boyd, standout for-
ward on Bobby Artman's frosh
squad may have been playing for
the West Virginia yearlings this
year, if it wasn't for his father’s
profession.

Art’s father, the Rev. Sproule
Boyd, preached at Morgantown,
W. Va., for ten years before trans-
ferring to Pittsburgh in 1946.

Art played halfback on the Morgan-

town High School football team in
his sophomore year and when his
family moved to Pittsburgh he con-
tinued his education at Peabody.

Morgantown’s loss w as Peabody’s
gain as Art sparked the Highlanders
in three sports. He played end on
Peabody’s football squad and was
not only regular center but top
scorer for two years on coach Dick
Meyers’ basketball team.

Asked about the third sport Art
smiled and said, "Volleyball -- we
were the state champs last year
beating North York for the title. I
was proud to be on that team.”

The 6-3, 195-pound forward has
only one peeve against basketball
this year. “This is the first year
that l’ve had to wear glasses while
playing, and I’m, always afraid
they’re going to come offduring the
game and cause me trouble.”

From the evidence of his floor
play Art is thinking more of con-

 

ART BOYD

trolling the baskets than the move-
ments of his glasses.He has showed
exceptional ability at rebound work
under both hoops, besides finding
time to make his share of points.
The Tech frosh recently found this
out when be accounted for 15
markers.

Art readily admits that the Fig-
ure Eight system of basketball is
the toughest part about the game
that he has come across, but he
adds, “It's hard to tell, but I feel
sure I can fit into the system.”

 

into action, it doesn't take him
long to wear out everyone in the
I65-pound division.

Could Rank With Best

Coach Rex Peery is very high on
Doc. "If he was in good shape,
Conklin would rank with the best
in the country. He knows all the
tricks,” says Peery.

Jim got his first taste of wrest-
ling at Waynesburg High School.
As a freshman he weighed 85 pounds
and slowly grew into a 120 pounder
by his senior year. He was unde-
feated in four years, winning 70
straight matches, and was the first
in the state to win four consecutive
PIAA titles.

Coaches, Too

"1 like football better than wrest-
ling," says Doc, "but I never had
time to try out for it in college.”

With wrestling making a come-
back at Pirt,Doc has been a bless-
ing to the Panther coach. His ex-
perience has enabled him to help
Peery out with some of the greener
hands. Jim has been working this
week on the willing Tony Razzano.

“We should have a good team

. next year,”Doc points out. "There

are some good freshmen coming up
and if anyone’s willing to learn,
33.e'.< Peery can teach them. He's a
good Coach.”
Conklin forgot to mention that

me, too, will be back next season.

Pitt Soars Into 80s, Drop Due

McCrossin, Team Hot,
Penn State Freeze Next

3! WILL DOERGE
Pitt’s Panthers, who hit a record scoring high of 84 points in
swamping Grove City Tuesday, may go to an opposite scoring ex-
treme when they battle Penn State’s Nittanies and their zone de-
fense tomorrow night at State College.

Pitt-Penn State basketball games
are notoriousfordeep freeze antics.
On pastoccasions, the Lions have
refused to come out of their tight
shell and reciprocally, Doc Carl-
son’s boys have refused to shoot.

Scores Anaemic

Their rivalry in recent years has
seen a halftime score of 5-2 on one
occasion atState
College, and a
State victory,
15-12, atthe Sta-
dium on another.

Withanew reg-
ular combo in .

action against
the Grovers Tues
day, Pitt broke a
five-game losing
streak by winning
handily, 84-51.

George McCrossin
was the individual standoutforPitt,
scoring 35 points in the rout, to in-

crease his season’s total to 10‘?

points.

McCrossin's outputfell two short
of Dodo Canterna’s all-time high of
3-’ points. Pitt’s 84 points, though.
set a new team high, snapping last
y<iar’s 80 point production at Miami,

Series Dead Even

Tomorrow’s game takes on added
significance since the all-time
series between the two schools
stands at 35 to 35. Penn State is
highly favored to break the dead-
lock, but Pitt will have a chance
to even things up again next Wed-
nesday when the Lions come to the

Wiry John McConkey led the
Library All-Stars to a 5-1 victory
and undisputed possession of first
place in an intramural soccer lea-
gue tilt on the Ellsworth turf Tues-
day afternoon against the Yankee
dribblers.

McConkey’s two ten foot scoring
boots in the third stanza virtually
iced the battle for his teammates,
as the Yankee defense crumbled
after these scores. McConkey’s
small stature and competitive zeal
made him comparable to a soccer
Cecconi.

Chick Wattik scored on an assist
from Sam Velmer in the first quarter
and again in the fourth on an assist
from McConkey to tie himself with
his pint-sized teammate for individ-
ual scoring honors.

Velmer, who also tended as
goalkeeper for the Library booters,
scored the victors’ fifth marker in
the fourth quarter. Bill Durkit
registered the lone tally for the
loosers on a penalty kick in the
third period.

Ted Geremsky

Quits Team

Reserve Center Ted Geremsky
quit the Pitt basketball team this
week.

The 6-5 Braddock product, who
also played end on the football
team, gave as his reason for quit-
ting “too long of a sports year.”
He said he would like more free
time after football season.

Geremsky denied that strife be-
tween himself and Coach H.C.
"Doc" Carlson had caused his
quitting. “Doc’s a great guy, he'll
give you the shirt off his back,”
he said. "He’s chewed me out, of
course, but Ilearned to take that in
the Army.” _

This year's club is the Univer-

Tony Razzano, for example.

 j,Quaint Debut
1 Chunky JTony, an
player, made his_debut in the
grapple sport last Saturday against
,.gl_;ock Haven. Somehow, Tony got
himself into a vertical position,
. .,standing on his shoulders with
;j T his legs wrapped around his op
pon_ent’s neck. I
With the crowd roaring in his
ears, Tony figured he had a pretty
good scissors grip on the fellow.
’ What he did not realize was that
his‘shoulders were, at the time,
level with the mat, so while he
squeezed ever the harder on his
, “‘enemy’s windpipe, the referee ex-
1 peditiously tolled out three counts
’,to award the match to the Lock
“ lg Haven man.
The decision appeared to re-
? gkpresent scarcely the zenith of
justice to Tony, who probably rea-
l'soried that the wrestler in the least
comfortable position is hardly a

But Peery doubtless explained

And progress, of course, is the
big problem to wrestling’s pro-
ponents here. When the spectators
have to climb all the way up to
the Stadium to see a sportwhich
they are not altogether sold on, they
are’ likely to stay home and play
checkers. or something.

“Hodges-Podge”

g In view of the necessity for
educating students to the sport,
the Athletic Administration should
press for the use of Stephen Foster
Hall for next year. I approached
Fletcher Hodges, who runs the
place, and while he gave me no
satisfaction, he did, however, give
me a book of Stephen Foster melo-
Vdies.

I am now privileged to know that
the gentleman wrote My Brudder

As far as the wrestlers are con-

; in the fifth dualmeet of the season.
Breaking into the lineup for the

‘ weight clash. Ewing’s efforts to-

man among the 175 pounders after
‘ ‘only two weeks on the squad. With
the blessing of Peery and the cheers
rof his private rooting section, the
_bull-like Tony will represent Pitt
i in the 175 pound event.
Among; the more experienced on
tomorrow's team will be Captain
' , Doc Conklin.He will wrestle in the
 L 165 pound division. Undefeated,
‘ Conklin will be after victory num-
ber five. Close behind Conklin in
victories is Ray Cappelli, Pitt’s
128 pounder, with a record of three

Dean Biddle concluded by saying
that everything, present plans and

Famous Marquette Alumnus, says:

“Chesterﬁelds are Milder. At the end of
a long day at the studios, no matter how
many I’ve smoked, Chesterﬁelds leave
a clean, fresh taste in my mouth. It’s the
only cigarette l’ve found that does that.”
