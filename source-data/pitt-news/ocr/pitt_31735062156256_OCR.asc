NSA PROBE????+Discussion at
Monday’s. S t 11 d e n t Congress
meeting centered, mainly on
charges brought against the Na-
tional Students Association for
being “communistic.” Attack was
lead by Joe Shuler (standing
left) who questioned represen-
tatives of the NSA attendingthe
meeting. Reason for the discus-
sion was that Student Congress
is considering becoming a mem-
‘ber of the nationalassociation.
Two members attended a con-
vention, of the group recently.

Robert Young

Dies at 62

Dr. Robert V. Young, 62, Pitt
professor of. education, died last
week in his home, 6417 Kentucky
Ave. ' .

Dr. Young was a specialist in
elementary education and in edu-
cation statistics. His standardized
tests _for elementary school pupils
are well known among educators.

   

By DAVE GR/EEN ' .

Councilman Joe Shul»-er’s cliargezs that the National Stu-.
dent Association was a ce2n1n‘unist-front organization sparked
Monday’s open Student Congress meeting. ‘ ~-

nt

With representatives of the N SA presenting the case for

Pitt’s joining, Shuler»proceeded to ask a

loyalty of the student group.

J Said Shuler, “Did the NSA

East Berlin Youth Festival?” Answered Amy Botsaris, presi-
dent of PCVv”s student legislature, “No.” . 

No Commies Allowed
Asked/Shuler, _“May' a Com-
munist become an oﬁicer of NSA?”
Retorted Ross Reese, SC member,
“To the same extent as a Com-
munist might become president of

Men’s Council.” '

\ Then charged Councilman Shu-
ler, “The NSA recently accepted a
seat, on the Academic ‘Freedom
Committee of the American Civil
Liberties Union.” He claimed that
according’ to The American Stu-
dent, official publication -of the
Students For America, the Civil

,_Liberties Union is a communist

front -— organization.
Union Praised .

Ross Reese pointed out that the
Civil Liberties Union had recently
been praised by the New York
Times, New York Post, and ten
United States Senators._

Reese claimed that Students for
America is at present the only
group "ﬁghting NSA and that it is

-“theimost ultra reactionary group

Rita McCaten, NSA co-ordinator

at Mt. Mercy college, noted that

the Students for America had‘ been

Robert Vogelerihas many mem-
ories. . — ' '

He remembers being imprisoned
by the Communists in a jail in
Hungary for 17 months. He can
still see the bare walls of this cell
and the hard cot in the corner. He
hears the moaning of the prisoner
in the next cell who has been
beaten on the soles of his feet un-
til they bled. He tastes yet the

black bread and thin soup that

were a major_part of his diet.
Well Composed

In spite of his ordeal, Vogeler
seemed natural and‘ composed
among the draperies and mellow
mahogany of the Schenley Hotel
last week. .

There for the \annual Personnel
Conference, Vogeler told reporters
his views on everything from the
presidential election to the “Hate
campaign in Europe.
Through it all, his voice was calm
and low, his hand steady as he lit
his cigarette. '

SC Constitution Discussed A
_ Student Congress’ revised constitution will come up for‘ I
consideration tomorrow evening at the group’s retreat in.

While» SC may give the constitution its. okay, ﬁnal de-

..with_ the student body‘ when it is
polled at spring registration.
In, Most evident revision of the
new document over the old is
its complete dropping of inter-
" 1131 elections of members of SC
_, from one year to the next.
According to the new constitu-
‘tion and by-laws, all students will
fibe elected" in the spring with the
sexception’ of representatives . of

. campus groups, the E & M Cabi-
net, the IF Council, Pan-hel Coun-
cil, Pharmacy School Council and

"each. One representative of the
-men’s, orientation classes will also
beelected.

Freslinien and sophomores will

' Relatively Unchanged
Congress committees are rela-

ftively unchanged, but chairmen

will not have as free a hand in

Weappointing 'mem_ber's to them as

ter organization in the world, held

elected honorary president of the
Students for America.)

Amy Batsaris, the NSA spokes-
man noted ‘ that NSA also held
seats. on UNESCO and the Amer-
ican Education Council. Reese
added that he had searched the
proceedings of the last NSA con-
vention, and claimed that its ap-
proval of FEPC was its most “left
winged action.” .

Dan Purdy appeared concerned
about the whole purpose of NSA.
He asked if NSA was a pressure
group. He was told that itwas
not. He asserted that if it com-
mented on such things as FEPC
that it must be a pressure group.
He was told by one of the repre-
sentatives, “Then what organiza-
tion isn’t?\”

Group Applies Pressure

' NSA’s stand on a “Student. Bill

of Rights” and academic freedom.

were cited as instances of the
group’s applying pressure tactics.

Many students attending the
meeting were concerned about
Pitt’s obligation to support actions
of NSA. They rwere told that indi-
vidual institutions were not held

responsible for actions if they ob-

jected to them.

Potential Stressed

Dean Lucille Allen of PCW, a
member of the NSA national ex-
ecutive council, said that it was
the obligation of member schools
to voice their opinions and act as
checks on the national group. She

added that NSA is “a potentially '

good or potentially bad organiza-
tion depending on its constituen-
cy.” “I do not believe,” she as-
serted, “that NSA had been cap-
tured by any group.”

Student Congress President Jack
Burwinkel asked Men’s Council
‘and WSGA to consider joining
NSAUin their meetings. He pre-
dicted that ﬁnal action on the pro-
posal would not be taken until the
beginning of the spring semester.

Pitt is ﬁnally: going to get its ‘long-awaited,’
long-promised Student Union. Plans have been
 drawn up for the structure, funds are snowball-
ing\~as— am result of the‘University fee thagis added‘
onto registration_ each semester, and the admin-
istration and.‘ trustees are behind the project. This
would seem to insure a speedy completion of

dream that" ‘has alternately
strengthened and waned, 10 these
many years. _ ~- 

But,‘ and that’s a-but» of fair-
ly ‘large proportions, we rhust

"add a word or so of ‘caution to '

the people who deem hasty"
completion above all else in the

‘ effort ‘to provide students with-

a suitable- meeting place or for
-whatever student unions are de-

signed; The-additions to the Schools of.l\'ledi_clne

By ELINORE STONE

A childhood dream of be-
coming a major league base-
.ball pit_cher has led freshman
John Helsall into an already
‘successful journalistic career.
Only 19 years old, the political
science major puts in 30 hours per
week as a sports reporter for the
Sun-Telegraph besides going to

-school, doing outside publicity jobs,

and selling articles to local maga-

_ zines.

_ While living in the Industrial
Home for‘Cripple_d Children, a po-
io victim since he was three, John

often dreamed of pitching major

league ball. " He became interested
innewspapei‘ work there also as
news editor for the Home’s small
paper. A
Began to Realize

Ashe grew older, however, John
beganto realize ‘that the "exercise

‘ involved in playing ball would be

too’ much for him and so turned his
full attention to writing.

At [13, he left the Home and en-
-tered Braddock High School. That
year ‘saw the. beginning. of‘ his
news_paper.career. Until 15, ‘John

Twas a correspondent for the Brad-

do_ck~ Free Press reporting junior

:and senior high school games. Two

years’ later, when only in tenth

Fund Set Aside .
‘Funds . for the Student Union
would come from the ‘University
Fee paid_.by students at registra-
tion and public subscriptions, Dean
Biddle said. He explained:-that a
fund. is set aside with; money col-

lected from this fee‘ from which

‘buildingsare built. .

These funds, h,_e-added, built the
Field House and other campus
buildings.

The Union would be built on the
lower campus, possibly‘ between
Heinz Chapel-and the Cathedral,
or as Dean Biddle stated it “as
close to the University’s population
as possible.” -

Nothing Deﬁnite

Several members of the Board
of Trustees including Mayor David

none could give’any.deﬁn_i‘te infor-

mation on the proposed building.

in the .upper third of his class in
1951' ‘and received a full—tuition

With the scholarship, came a 30 to

Last May, however, the sports
writer returned to Pittsburgh and
joined the staff of the Sun-Tele-

leg—man and sports writer. Now
he works there afternoons, even-
ings and Saturdays, attending
classes in the rnornind.

John’s busy 19 years'of “meet-

As to the future, John would

he added, his own publicity agehcy.

mused. _ ‘
While he was in prison, Vo-

geler's cell was ﬂooded constant- ._

extremely charitable fashion to-
ward all their guests, and have
yet to win a home engagement in
six tries. -

Another thing, the Panthers are
looking for their ﬁrst road victory,
and Doc is hoping to get off to a
winning start as tonight’s game
marks the opener of a _seven—gam
road series. -

Currently sporting a 7-4 record,
the Blue-and-Gold are due for a
little more success away from

home, particularly since more re-

serves have been coming along far
enough to back up the regulars.

Led by Captain Mickey Zernich
with 17 3 points, Don Virostek with
134, and Dutch Burch with 114,
the locals have outshot, percent-
age-wise, and outscored the oppo-
sition by 778-732.

Also, they have rebounded more
and committed less fouls, and
might well show a near perfect
slate but for foul shooting.

The free throw line is the only
department in which Doc’s boys
lag, hitting on 60 per cent t-o the
enemy’s 64 per cent.

Frosh Squads Clash

In this evening’s encounter, Tech
will be relying on its veteran
sharpshooter and defensive ace,
Center Tom Craig, who leads his
team with 121 points. Dick Deit-
rick, nursing an injured leg, may
see limited action with the Pan-
thers.

In the preliminary, the Pitt frosh
will attempt to even up their chart
with their fourth win when they
take on the Tech frosh at 7 p.m.

_Both coaches agreed that the officiating was poor and recom-
mended the Ivy League setup as a way "to keep ‘em honest. If
nothing else their plan would take the place of the home town plan.

Most recent victim-of the homer treatment was Penn State
"Saturday night when it uiopped a 57-56 decision in the last
second. Three Panthers ambushed State’s Herb Sledznik on the
40-yard line and dropped him to-rest there until Bobby Artman
tapped in the winning basket.

Where were the refs? Well,,Zeke Zerilla ‘was on the play but .

claimed that he thought the game was over. _Red Mihalik was far
down ﬁeld and screened from the pileup. '

’But who cares, anyway. Penn State got the treatment that day
and fitt will get it later. Leave it to the otﬁcials to apply the
equalizer. \‘ A —
I A few years ago Dr’. H. C. Carlson smoked out the homers

in an oﬁiciating report. At the time Carlson was" chairman of

the oﬁiciating research-committee of the National Association of

Basketball Coaches and receivedreports from all over the coun-

The returns indicated that ( 1) the home team is generally fav-

is generally favored on out of bounds awards, and (3) most offi-
cials do not call the two shot intential foul, unless the foul is on
an attempted shot. ’ ’

the college football world regarding the Notre Dame “suck-
er shift,” the originator of the whole’ ruckus sat in the Field
House surveying the results of his ingenuity-—possibly with
some amusement and certainly with profound interest.
1 Though few fans are aware of it, Notre Dame did not
invent the "Notre Dame shift any more than the Russians
‘ ﬁnvented “beisbol”—-th ey just
latched on. _
No, the real culprit who caused
a’ major rule change at last
week’s NCAA meeting in Wash-

ington is Pitt’s own Red Daw-
son. '

“We were the ones who started
it last year,” relates Dawson. “We
‘used it on Notre Dame, and they
took it up. They had never used it
until then.” b 7

The original shift developed
from the T-formation, with the
linemen spaced further apart than
usual. Then, ‘ as the backs
switched to the single wing, the
line closed up slightly, sometimes
drawing the foe offside.

The cry set. up after the _Irish
. used it near Southern Ca1ifor- ,
nia’s goal line put the issue up
to the rules committee, which
declared that no‘ lineman shall
_,_move after assuming his original
three-point sgance. ’ The backs,
of course, may still shift. ‘
Dawson will continue to. shift,
within. the rule, even. though the
effectiveness of the original shift
will be considerably lessened.
