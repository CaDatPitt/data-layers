Miss Morganstern said.

Studios for the station are lo-
cated on Pitt’s campus, and West-
inghouse Radio Inc. has given
permission for the use of the
KDKA tower atop the campus.

The Board of Directors of the
station hope that WQED and its
programs will serve as a “win-
dow into Pittsburgh’s colleges and
universities.”

To raise the necessary funds for
the station, a four hour door-to-
door campaign has been planned
for Tuesday, Sept. 28, Miss Mor-
ganstern announced. She urges
anyone interested to help in the
campaign. A year’s subscription
to “Program Previews,” a month-
ly bulletin announcing program
times and descriptions will be
mailed to anyone who donates
$2.00 or more to the campaign
fund. -

Auditions for talent suitable for
the children’s hour broadcast will
be held 3-1:_the station in October,
according to Miss Morganstern.
Program ideas and scripts dealing

captors.

Sponsored by the Pitt YMCA,
Dr.» Hayes will meet students for

While a missionary in China, Dr.
Hayes was seized by Chinese Com-
munist authorities in 1950 and
held for two years. He was sub-

jected to mental and physical tor-'

tures. The Reds, he says, attempt-
ed to make him “confess” that he
was an American spy. At one
point in his trials, he exclaimed:
“I am telling the truth. If you

don’t believe me, go ahead and,

shoot.”

Dr. Hayes will be in Pittsburgh
three days. He will speak in the

l Artist's Sketch of Proposed Signl

o T G l o ’ 9
Signs for Our Times

A stranger from a neighboring state drove through the
Oakland district this summer and, as he was passing the

-Cathedral, inquired of his companion: ".What on earth is_ .

that skyscraper doing out here so far from the business.
district?” The visitor was quickly informed about the Uni-,
versity’s “Tower of Learning.” With modest pride in our,
“skyscraper school,” we like to think that the Cathedral is‘
known throughout the country as the tallest school build-

ing. But the fact is, there are many people who wouldn’t

recognize the Cathedral if it fell on them nor could they
dinstinguish it from the Grant Building. Certainly, if they‘
don’t know the signiﬁcance of the most impressive build-
ing on the campus, how are they expected to know that this
is the campus of the University of Pittsburgh without a
sign to tell -them? . .
Although we can’t picture a huge neon sign ﬂashing
out the word PITT in lights on top of the Cathedral, wouldn’t
a small, impressive corner post on either the Bigelow and
Forbes or Fifth and Bigelow corners be an appropriate but
conservative announcement that -this is the University?
The Pitt News artist has drawn up a sketch giving the
general idea and location of a sign for such a purpose. It
would not be ﬁambouyant nor would it be so small as to
defy attention, nor detract from the appearance of the
campus. And while We’re thinking about the idea, how’

about the smaller signs on the various buildings making up

‘the campus to inform visitors,,new students, and people
who have been around but still don’t know which building

, is where. It woul_d also be a constant -reminder t_o the people

of Pittsburgh.

If one of the groups around the University is‘ interested
in such a proposal, we would be glad to cooperate with them
and the proper authorities in attempting the project.

Music for All   «

Free organ recitals are not ‘endowed with the drawing
power of a Stadium football contest but they are still an
attraction to people genuinely interested in organ music as
rendered by an artist. Mr. Frederic W. Lotz has been the
University organist for. quite can number of years, accom-
panying the Heinz Chapel Choir, playing for weddings in_
the Chapel, and giving recitals from 1 to 1:30 p.m. daily
except Thursday in Heinz Chapel. Mr. Lotz’ repertoire for
these concerts ranges through Bach, Brahms, Handel, Dethi-
er, Widor and a host of others. .

Although designed primarily for the students and facul-
tyof the University, t-he recitals are open to the public and
attended reg'ularly by people who haveoheard and grown to
love the. music that acquires a particularly‘ stirring quality

in the subdued atmosphere of the Chapel.

They‘re Falling Apart. . .

Compass Not Magnetic This Year

By Dave Green V

One‘ look at the paper backed, blue booklet
laughingly called the Compass this year seems
to indicate that somebody got shortchanged, and

it looks like it was the male population of the"

University.

Activities men wailed when they found that the
book; so useful in" the past as a convenient date
book was practically worthless
for that purpose. The ‘steel ring
binding had given way to a past-
ed back that will probably fall
apart before Christmas.

As far as its contents, the
Compass held true to form this‘~
year. It contains the usual as-
sortment of information for
freshmen as well as songs and
cheers. A few typographical
errors brought chuckles though.
Alma Mater Fouled Up _

Freshmen wondered why the reversed second
and third lines of the Alma Mater didn’t match
the music, and the Pitt News Editor is still won-
dering whether‘ his name is Kovar or Covar. Chuck
Suprock, Owl Editor, found that his name had a
heretoforelunnoticed “a” in it. The Compass even
fouled itself up by defining itself as “the band
book for men.” Fortunately, its staﬁers found that
the ﬁrst few books off the presses had the familiar
Hungerford cartoons printed upside down.

Pictures of campus politicos "were splattered

throughout the issue,‘ and lots'of people wondered
why the mighty and revered assistant editor of

   

 

 

the Compass rated a brand new picture, when the .

rest of the publications showed no one less" than
editor and business manager. A
Cut Budget Blamed . -

Most students chalked these matters up to the
fact that one’s countenance,,in' print is often more

gratifying than. a job well (or otherwise) done, ,

and that pictures are good patronage.

Generally, male students are displeased with
this year’s Compass, and while_ its contents may
be chalked against its editors, its appearance is
another concern. ,

The simple fact is that the budget of the Com-
pass was drastically cut this year. ‘This cut ne-
cessitated its shorter length and its cheap cdyer
and binding. There was nothing in the "way of
good editing that could overcome that deﬁciency.

can't compare with Vade Mecum
' The ‘shoddy condition of,the Compass is doubly
biting because of the attractive book this year
produced by Vade Mecum, the womep’s handbook.
One of the most‘ beautiful books of recent years,
the Vade Mecum this year is ring-bound and has
a gold leather cover. While Vade Mecum does not
have pictures of presidents and assistant . editors,
its better quality- is probably the result of pro-
portionally larger budget. Its greater size and. ﬁner

quality seem‘ to "bear this out.

Why such an inequitable situation should exist
has not been explained. Perhaps there’ is good
reason for it.‘-'_ My own compasslbroke in two when

 ‘Villagers Live in Mud Huts

Mary Fuget Tells of India Trip

By IRENE ROZAKIS

_“To meet, and live, and
work, and - share experiences
with Indian students;” this
was the purpose of “Project
and the purpose of its
representative Mary Fuget, who
toured India this summer with the
help of funds donated by students
‘at Pitt.

_‘ This purpose, she feels, was deﬁ-
nitely fulﬁlled during her tour
through New Delhi, Lucknow,
Agra, Baroda, Bombay, Kolap ur,
Bangalor, Mysore, Madras, and
surrounding villages,

Traveling with a Smith College
-student, Elaine Austin, Mary lived
in student hostels with Indian stu-

’ dents‘ and a few from Africa and .

Ceylon.
Talked to Students
Part of the tour consisted of
talks to Indian’ student bodies,
where the girls explained who was
responsible for the‘ project ‘and
answered questions about the
United’ States and its‘colleges.
Questions ranged‘ from why‘
the United States dislikes Rus-
sia to why college students have‘
house parties. The Indian stu-
dents were also interested in ex-
tracurricular 1CtiVitIeS in our .
colleges. ~
One of the biggest impressions
-with which Mary returned was
that both United States and India
hold a great many false notions
about each other. The average
American, she éontends, still be-
lieves-that India consists solely of
elephants and cobras.

No. Elephant Ride‘

“We wanted ‘to ride an" elephant
before ‘we, left,” she adds wist-
fully, “but they just aren’t wan-
dering around the streets!”

Although Mary believes that you
can't. generalize about India, she
noted .a few'diﬂerences in culture
and customs. Courtship customs
usually depend on parental ap-
proval. , .

There is a great deal more free-
dom in courtship than formerly,
but there is still no actual system
of “dating” as in this country.

Cities are modern, of course,
but the villages could not be
- compared to small towns in the
United States. Many of the vil-
lagers live in mud huts, with no
central heating, no lighting as
we know it, and nothing in the
way of home appliances.
The mud’ is a handicap when

quite easily. /In the poorest homes,
however, the guest is treated with
the utmost ‘ hospitality.

A typical day for the girls in-
cluded breakfast with tea in the
morning, tea again at 4 p.m. and
dinner at 7:30. In the city of Agra
the schedule was somewhat altered
with tea at 7 p.m. and breakfast

. Hot Tea, Not Iced
 Before going there, Mary says
‘it was “hard to imagine drinking
teaiin the hot summer afternoon,”
but she soon discovered that it
removed fatigue better than cold
drinks did.’

-The two girls also stopped in
the Middle East where they feel
there is also‘ need for “more un-
”derstanding.’’

Indian people have a great
emany doubts about the motives
of the United States. They are
not quite sure of this country’s
.positions in Korea and Red’

China. . /

Russia and America, they feel,
are “using other countries toﬁght
their own private war.” Although

Oddly enough, the majority of

A Strong Conviction ,

Mary returned with at least one
strong conviction. She would like

Approval Close
For SC Student
Orchestra Plan

Student Congress is close to
ﬁnding approval from faculty and
administration officials for a pro-
posed student orchestra.

The approval is expected at any
moment. Then, according to Ada
Joseph, SC recording secretary,
actual work on the project can
“really get under way.” Robert L.
Arthur, band director, has agreed
to conduct the orchestra, Miss J o-
seph said. ‘ ’

Another “stirprise” feature of
the proposed group is that the
dean of women’s ofﬁce has given
its approval, and will permit
freshman women to become‘~mem—
bers of the planned orchestra.
Present policy is that no freshman
woman may take part in any ac-
tivity except in the various
Guilds.

Plans for a student orchestra
ﬁrst got under way last semester
when a committee from Student
Congress headed by Ada Joseph
was asked to investigate its possi-
bilities. _

A student orchestra was active
at Pitt before World War II but
was discontinued because of a
shortage of string instruments. At
the time the group was considered
“excellent,” said Miss Joseph. Mr.
Arthur conducted the pre—war or-
chestra. '

A The rise of West Virginia from a perennial pushover

Although Lewis’ team won only
two games in 1950, the following
year showed a decided improve-
ment when the Mountain Dew

‘were still disappointed over the

losses to Pitt and Penn State, their
arch and hated rivals. Last fall,
Mountaineer rooters realized one-
half of their dreams and although’
West Virginia‘ has not beaten
Penn State since 1944, there is a
sneaky feeling that Lewis would

_ rather beat Pitt than State any-

day in the week, especially on Sat-
urday. But this could be the year
West Virginia beats both Pitt and
Penn State, a feat which has nev-
_er been accomplished.
Scared Nittanies

Last season, West Virginia lost
its opener to Furman because
Lewis refused to open up until it
was too late, and in Penn State
game, two ﬁrst-half penalties
practically eliminated any chance
of a Mountaineer victory.

Coach Rip Engle, State mentor,
was mighty happy to leave Mor-
gantown that nighjc.

When Lewis became head coach
three years ago, he decided that

/there was enough talent in his

own state to ﬁeld agpowerful foot-
team. Naturally, Lewis’
scouts wandered to Western
Pennsylvania for a few players
but, on the whole, the West Vir-
ginia roster does not read like
Georgia’s or Miami’s.

“It’s wonderful to see the new (frosh) boys turn out in

such a large group,” Coach Carl‘v

son, Olson explains, “They are re-

ceiving some good tips on running
from one of our best (Bernie Lu-
terancik) .” ~

Luterancik, last season’s crack
captain of the Panther harriers,
can be remembered for setting the
home course record of 22:08.7 in
1951.

Blister Trouble

As’ for the varsity members,
after two weeks a number’ of the
boys are bothered by blisters on
their feet, and Allen Gunderson

has missed a few days action due
to a chest cold.
Olson explains the blisters say-

ing, “Naturally, after not running_

during the summer months the
feet tend to become tender and
therefore blisters result.” “To com-
bat this and also to stretch the
muscles,” the veteran mentor con-
tinues,” we have these condition-
ing practices weeks before our
ﬁrst meet.”

O1son’s plan of conditioning be-
gins with loosening up exercises
followed by calisthenics topped off
by a running “in and ou ” (jog-
ging and sprinting) session.

No Stars

“I don’t groom any of my men A

to be stars,” asserts the coach,”
because I believe cross-country is
a team sport.’ Continuing, he com-
ments, “If I can get my ﬁrst ﬁve
boys to ﬁnish with only 20 sec-
onds between the ﬁrst and ﬁfth I
will be happy.’

At present the team starters
haven’t been -named, since each
man requires a different length of
time to reach his best form. ‘For
instance Co—captain Dan Sommer,
nicknamed by his coach as one
of the “Flying Parsons” on the
squad due to his ambition to en-
ter the ministry, has for the past
two campaigns been slow in ﬁnd-
ing his best time.

Summing up the past week’s
practices, Olson adds, “The boys
have come through the ﬁrst two
weeks of conditioning surprisingly
well and I am pleased with their
progress.” »

Iniuries Aren'I "
Whol TI1ey.Seem

By RUSS FRANKE
Sports ' Editor

 

 

Every so often you hear or read about someone com-

I plaining that football is too rough and dangerous and should

be modiﬁed. Usually the complaints are the aftermath of a
statistical survey pointing out the unnecessary physical hurts
sustained in an over—commercialized sport.

1 Even the Russians have put in their two cents about
our game of ”fjutbol,’? claiming that every day young Ameri-
cans have to be carted off the ﬁeld in wheelbarrows, bleeding
and maimed, as fresh material is led on to the ﬁeld to be
slaughtered. Of course, these same Russians modestly ad-
mitted, on another occasion, that they are the ones who in-
vented' the sport. .Which they didn’t.~

But, getting down to the playing conditions of today, you
can hardly say that our autumn pastime is really too rough
to be tolerated. ‘

‘ ' _ Players in Shapg
Football, by its very. nature, appears brutal to those

-who sit in the stands and hear the resounding crack of

shoulder pads or helmet striking another hard surface on

 sharp contact. And when one of the gladiators lies stretched

out on the grass following such anencounter, sighs of pity
go up for the unfortunate victim who, it turns out later,

"has ’merely hadhis .wind knocked out.

‘ It must be remembered that American gridders are kept
in a constant state of rigid physicalconditioning and are
almostimmune to bumps which would ﬂatten the ordinary
office worker (or newspaperman) for good.

T is Easier . -

And usually injuries that are termed “serious” amount
to just_a twisted ankle or a wrenched knee, which keeps the
victim out of drillslfor a week at the most. Besides,_we may
add facetiously‘, whatwould the poor coaches do for moan-
ing material without a twist or a bruise now and then?

No, With the advent of -the T—formation and its modiﬁ-
cations, action has become so streamlined. that passes and
hipper—dipper -plays, have outmoded the head-softening
charges of-the old-fashioned line smashes. Much of the line
play requires only brush-blocking. ' 

You have to go Way back in the history of the“’sport to

 realize how rough it once was.

_ Irish Played Rough .

The brand of football played in Ireland amounted to a
village massacre in the early days. The entire able—bodied
population of one town would stage a pushing, kicking,
punching -brawl against the next, town’s citizenry, with the
human remnants scattered along the road between.

In this country, the game developed from rugby and
soccer, and was outlawed for a time by New England col-
lege authorities. Too many students were unable to attend
classes after a bracing ‘round of mayhem on the campus.
Shortly after, equipment .was provided and rules made up
to allow intercollegiate meets.

In England, the sport was once ‘banned by Edward II.
Their type of football evolved into_soccer, which some say

‘is rougher than football, but Which is no reason for a mere

king to kick.

IM Pigskin Entries Due Soon;

I Bemis Wants Bigg.er Program

Director of Intramural Activities Leo Bemis is hoping
for another successful IM touch-football season which be-
gins Tuesday, Oct. 6.. . '

In 1952, the program consisted of ﬁve leagues with the
total of 57 ‘teams using 620 student footballers.

Defending I_M champions Delta Tau Delta are picked to

be equally as strong for the coming campaign. In addition
‘ to. theirs Pitt‘ conquests, the Delts

 

represented the University in the
All-Ci-ty IM championship ‘and
won, beating Duquesne’s entry,
7-6. "

, ‘Runnerup to the IM champs was
the Phys Ed Club who were win-
ners of the Independent League.
Other league champs ‘were: Sigma
Chi,‘ Section Fraternity League,
Civil A"s, Engineer Loop, and the
Faculty Diehards conquers of the
Professional circuit.’ V

Plans for the Fraternity Leagues
have already been discussed at a
meeting held last Wednesday at
Ellsworth Center. The Indepen-
dents, Professionals, and Engineers

- will have their~managers meet at

4:45 ‘p.m. Sept. 30 at" the same
building. '

In quest of a bigger and better
program, Bemis says, “Any stu-
dent who can get together with

six or seven others can enter a
team in one of the leagues.”.Also,
if anyone who cannot organize his
own squad and still would like to
join a team, he has only‘ to turn
his name into me.”

All teams entering an Intramur-
al league should appoint a team
manager as the manager is the
point of contact between his team
and the IM office. Meetings of the
managers are" held periodically to
discuss IM pgoblems.

Oct. 2 is the ‘entry deadline date
and all interested students should
contact Mr. Bemis at the Field
House or by calling Ext. 661.

McCabe Learns It Hard Way I

Learning football is a mat-

ter of playing and not watch-
ing, even if you’re watching
-the professional Pittsburgh

Steelers, according to Richie
McCabe. '

The modest 6-0, 175—pound
halfback who has been affil-
iated with the Steeler organi-
zation for seven years, will
vouch for his opinion from ex-
perience. _

Richie has been the pros’
locker room" attendant since
1947 and has observed many col-
lege stars learning the rights and
wrongs of their game.

Gets Offensive Chance

“But you only get so much from
watching,” adds the quick-think-
ing_junior, “and you have to go

Richie played almost a quarter
of offense against North Carolina
State last year although he “didn't
carry the ball,”
he’ll probably receive numerous
opportunities to squirm through
the Mountie line. I

Theories Discussed’

 

 

On Job Interviews 

If the theory of Pitt psychologist¢

Jack Matthews proves successful,
future job applicants may be in-
terviewed with a “1anguage-be-
l'iavio_r” technique. Mr. Matthews,
associate professor of psychology

and director of Pitt’s speech clinic,

has advanced the idea that “what
you are may very well be reveal-
ed, at least in part, by what you
say and -how you_say it, by your
language behavior.”. ,

In a speech at the sixty—ﬁrst an-
nual meeting of the ‘American
Psychological As s o c i a t i o n in
Cleveland, he maintained that
present interview techniques are
inadequate. Directing his words

primarly to industrial and busi-

ness psychologists, ,Mr. Matthews
claimed that at present “we don’t
know‘what to look ‘for, in an ap-
plicantr” /9

Rebuking. the old method of
across the desk interviews, he ad-
vanced the idea of the group in-
terview, sometimes called leader-
less group discussion. In an in-

formal discussion, employees may

be provided clues about an in-
dividual’s;personality, his world-
ly ideas, his attitude toward peo-
ple. They may indicate his preju-
dices andbiases, his troubles and
opinions.

For example, Mr. Matthews
pointed out, the dogmatic person
frequently uses the word “all,”
and an overly rigid person might
use “either—or” language.

Pressing his point that speech
may provide clues about a per-
son’s suitability to a job, psy-
