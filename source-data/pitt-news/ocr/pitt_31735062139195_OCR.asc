HAMILTON IN CHARGE

At a meeting of the Entertaillment
Committee of the Alumni Council
held at the University Club last Fri-
day. it was decided to hold the an-
nual commencement banquet at Hotel
Schenley, 'Wednesday, June
teent'h_. at 6:30 P. M.

Mr. _A. R. Hamilton, President of
the General Alumni Association, has
been selected as toastmaster and a
list of speakers is in course of prep-
aration. ,

Members of the graduating classes
have been given a special rate of
$1.50 per plate. Trustees, faculty,
alumnae and alumni will be charged
$2.50 per plate. The special rate for
seniors was made so as to minimize
and the
loss will be borne by the General
Alumni Association.

An innovation of this banquet will
be the invitation that trustees, faculty
and alumni bring their _wives or
sweetheartspand alumnae their hus-
bands or escorts.

The classes of l86l—2—3—4, 1880-l-2-3,
1899, 1900-1-2-7-9 .and 1911 will hold

reunions on Tuesday and it is ex-

pected that most of their members-

will attend the banquet VVednesday
evening.

If all members of the graduating
classes attend, there will be over ﬁve
hundred sons and daughters of Pitt
in attendance at the banquet.

Notices will be sent to all alumni,
trustees and faculty membeﬂ shortly
and tickets may be obtained from the
deans of the various schools, or from
Secretary Silverman of the General
Alumni Association, from June 4th to
15th, inclusive. As it will be abso-
lutely necessary to guarantee the ex-
act number of plates required, all
who intend going are urged to pur-

chase tickets before June 10th if pos-

sible. ’

BIG T Gi§’is

The committee in charge of the
biology feed to be held to—night an-
nounces that extensive preparations
have been made for it and that some
of the good things they are going to
have would tempt even the most del-
icate palate. They refuse to give out
a menu, however, stating that they
wish to surprise the class. It is
planned to have a dance after the
“eats” and it is hoped that everyone
will come and help make the affair a
huge success.

The sweets to the good! Certain-

dispensed sweets to the I manly
"fussers” of the University last Fri-
day. The girls’ object——to raise suf-
ﬁcient funds to sendtheir delegates
to the Y. W. C. A. convention. An-
nouncements were posted Thursday
of this wonderful feast——and when the
hour came the halls were ﬁlled with
Pitt men. Futssers, big, little, rich,
poor, all were there. The broke ones
mourned, while the “bents”. but not
“brokes” reaped the fruits of their
money. Suffice it to say that in one-
half hour the fair and beautiful co—eds
had exchanged a large amount of
sweets for\a similarly large amount
of the shekels. But the show did not
end there. Dispersed in groups of
two the exchange kept on until a sad
fate let loose the seniors from class-
meeting and broke up the Seance.

OWLS GOING FAST

Please call for the “Owls” at once
as they are being sold very rapidly.
Almost the whole edition will be
gone in a day or two and those who
have not procured one up to the pr-es-
ent will do so as soon as possible.

political conditions in those States.
He spoke on the movement for the

SUCCESSFUL SEASON

The Classical Club held its last
meeting of the school year last Fri-

the meeting and enjoyed a very pleas-

ant program, consisting of several
musical selections and several ad-
dresses.

Mr. G. H. McVVherter, ’14, who has
successfully’ presided"‘over the club
during the past year,.made a short
speech. He spoke of the successful
year the club had just -closed and of
the prospects for accomplishing great

the important organizations of the
school and all. students interested

GIRLS’ COMMITTEE
TO HOLD PICNIC

At the regular meeting of the
girls’ executive committee on Satur-
day afternoon it was decided that the
executive committee arrange for a
picnic to be held at the end of the
year. It was thought that a picnic
would be a suitable ﬁnale to the amic-
able relations of the girls during the
year and no effort will be ‘spared to
make this affair one of the most en-
joyable of the school year. The com-
mittee hopes that all of the girls will
come out for this, as they feel that an
affair by the girls for the girls should
be of great interest to all the girls.

part:

_ “It has been said by a noted foreign
writer that the American people are
the ﬁlthiest nation on the earth.
Much -of the cause for this prevalent
belief can be attributed to the care-
less consideration of the fly by the
American people. The ﬂy is a.
breeder \of tuberculosis. The
problem is one of the great problems
confronting the American people to-
day. It costs us $5,000,000 annually
in doctor bills. Among babies espe-
cially the fly spreads disease by in-
fecting the milk and other food eon-
sumed by them. We cannot tell how
many diseases are due to the fly until
we exterminate it. In fact, the ex-
termination of the fly is the ﬁrst step
towards our entrance into the l<in_r.:-
dom of good health. The problem is
an educational one. We must arouse

the people to reason as -to ways of"

exterminating the ﬂy and thus im-
proving our health. We have been-

"SPORTING EDITOR GOES

AWAY FOR THE SUMMER*

Chalmers Hall, sporting editor of
the \/Veekly, left last week to take a
position with a mining firm in Idaho
for the summer.‘ Mr. Hall was not
given much time to make up his mind
whethe;r to go or not. He received a
‘telegram late Sunday saying that if
he wished to take the position he
must leave Pittsburgh not later than
Wednesday morning. ’

In a letter to the Pitt'VVeekly M r. ‘

Hall expressed his regret at having
to leave the paper on such short no-
tice. He said that he expected to re-

turn to the University next year and’

hoped to have some new and interest.-
ing features for the sporting page of
the Weekly. The decision of Mr.
Hall to accept the position of sport-
ing editor for next year came after a
long period of deliberation. At first
every effort to induce him to edit the
sporting page for the next year failed,
-but his recent letter indicates that he‘
has reconsidered his first decision and
will be on “the staff next year.

At the suggestion of Mr. Hall, Rob-
ert Foreman will have charge of the
sporting page during the remainder
of the present school year. Before
leaving for the west Mr. Hall had a
long talk with Mr. Foreman and gave
the editor pro tem. many pointers as
to the best manner of conducting the
page for the last few issues of the
year.

ization of the university and college.
Each university in its _social system
has features of excellence, and fea-

-tures open to criticism, due sometimes

to local causes, often to an evolution
from economic lack of dormitories and
dining halls. At every university
among the faculty, the trustees, and
especially the older alumni, is a quick-
ened sense of the need of ‘progression
-and correction due to loyalty to a
perception of -the overshadowing im-
portance of thorough and inspiring ed-
ucation and a more sympathetic and
informing democracy.

At Harvard, Freshman dormitories

A are being planned to augment the ex-

cellent democratic inﬂuence of the
Harvard Union; at Princeton, great
reforms have been accomplished in the
Freshrr_1an and Sophomore eating
clubs, and ‘the bringing‘ of those
classes as integral bodies into a com-
mon dining hall; at Yale, the Sopho-
more societies have been abolished and
the Junior societies increased and the

begi_nning of a scholarship test has

been put in force, "while the minor de-
tails of the’ visible forms of the Senior
Secret Society System are under im-
portant discussion.

The extraordinary thing is that
here, where the social’ organization
plays so important a part, it has de-
veloped in a dozen different forms.
There are four distinct variations: The
closed clubs of Harvard, ‘the 'open
clubs of Princeton, the Senior Society
System of Yale, and the general fra-
ternity system of the State universities
and the small colleges such as Am-
herst, Williams and Wesleyan. Be-
yond these four distinct manifesta-
tions are innumerable combinations
and local evolutions.

Believing that a mutual knowledge
of the merits and defects of the sys-

tems in vogue, as well as the argu- ‘

ments pro and con, would be of larger
public interest andservice, I should
like to propose through your good of-
ﬁces a competition for the best con-
structive plan for the social organiza-
tion of a university or college; "I
shall‘ be very glad to offer a prize of
$150 for that paper which shall be ad-
judged the best submitted by an under-
graduate, rind $100 for the best paper
from a graduate. _

There will be not the slightest lim-

mitted, except of its possible effective-

CAP AND GOWN CLUB.

As a ﬁnishing touch to a very suc-
cessful season the Cap and Gown Club
held a banquet at the University Club
on Monday evening of this week.
Every member of the organization
was on hand and the evening was
spent in a real old fas'hioned college
way. _ ‘ i
The past season has been one of
the best, if not the best, seasons
,‘ever enjoyed by the ,organization.
The home performance was all th.at
-could be desired and com-pared very
favorably with any of the produc-
tions of the big eastern schools. T-he
product-ion this year gave evidence of
long and careful preparation, and
those in charge of the work of. di-
recting the drills and rehearsals de-
serve the highest praise. Each mem-
ber of the cast should be very highly
complimented for the part they had
in the success of the production.
But the work -of last season is only
a mere shadow of the coming great-
‘ness of the club. ‘Every year adds
more experience to t'h-e assets of the
organization, and each new year of
experience adds to the success of the
production of the following year.

More men are needed for the active‘

work of the club and a larger number
of students should come out nextyear
for the club. A good playis needed
for next year and some student or
students should get busy at once and
start to write the book for the 1913
pr-oduc-tion.‘ It would be .a good thing
for some'student of ability to spend
his spare moments during vacation
’writing aplot for the Cap and Gown
Club.

JUNIOR OWL.

The class of 1913 may well be proud
‘ of their Owl. In every respect this
year’s annual publication is worthy 0.‘
‘the highest commendation. In con-
struction and in its design it’ is above
all other Owls, perhaps; the ‘sporting
review for the year is the‘ ‘best that
has ever been published; altogether

the book is a great success.
- To all those students who so freely

gave of their time and energy in order

\-

to make the _l9l3 Owl go down in his-
tory as one of the best Owls everlpub-
lished, the student body, especially the
"Junior class, should be very grateful
No publication such as the Owl is
able tobe published without a great
amount of work being done by those
connected with its publication, and toe
much credit cannot be given to any
that gave a helping hand in the work
of publishing the 1913 Owl.

Now is the , time for the Dresent
Sophomore class to be making plans
and electing men to carry on the work
of publishing the Owl of 1914. , ‘

MM]. ‘BOX

Mr. Editor :—The Alumnus who
wrote you last week to the effect that
the college yell “Alle-ge—nee, ge-nac.
ge-nac,” originated with M11 .l0hn Gv
Stephenson, Jr., class of 93, and not
with Mr. W. A. Johnson, class of 91,

dent publications, football programs,
etc., of the last six years, for in every
one this yell has been credited to Mr.
Johnson. ,
, Of course, it may well be that it
was only at the last banquet that
“Alumnus” received this information
which is new to most of us. I have

A - before me a letter from Mr. Johnson

under date of’ October 9,_ 1909, in
which he says: “Also claim P§‘011d
honor of ‘having invented the Univer-
sity yell, ‘ Alle-ge—nee, ge—n-ac, ge-
nac.”’

Perhaps some other Alumnus can
set us straight on this matter.

MR. CHOWEY ' ~
ADDRESSES CHAPEL

Last \/Vednesday the Cosmopolitan
Club wcr’e in charge of the meeting,
at which Mr. Chowey, its president,
addressed chapel on Hindustan and
Hindus. He gave a short account of
the origin of the caste system, and
idolatry and showed in a humorous

way how caste system existed in dif-

ferent forms in different countries.

He also touched on the position
of women of India. Of their
past achievements, both in mental

abilities and military prowess. He
spoke als-o of the women of today.
He mentioned the name_of Landita
Ramalai, a lady who has traveled all
over‘ Europe, America and Japan, and
after her return founded a school for
Hindu widows and to-day it has de-
veloped into an institution where
1,600 souls are taken careiof and edu-
cated. He‘ also spoke -of-women of
India editing magazines, not only in
their native tongue, but also in the
English language. He said: ‘

“Of course the womeniof Europe
are far ahead of our women, but some
of the Europeanwomen have made
such great strides in the walks of life

ORGANIC CHEMISTRY CLASS ,
GOES TO P-ICKLE FACTORY

The class in organic chemistry un-
der Dr. Phillips made a visit to the
Heinz plant in Allegheny on last
Thursday afternoon. The company
was very’ courteous in its endeavors
to make the afternoon enjoyable as
well as instructive. J‘

The prime object was to inspect
the vinegar works, to look into the
new methods of preparing this prod-
uct on a large scale. By this new and
improved method the vinegar is pre-
pared in as low as thirty days. Large
revolving drums of ten feet in width
and twelve feet in depth are used to
prepare it, enabling them to turn out
about 300 barrels a day of the pure
white wine vinegar.

After visiting these works the
party were taken through all . the
other departments and every process
was explained, emphasis being layed

ture. A

Among the places of interest were
the first building of .the bstablishment

built in 1855 by Mr. Heinz’s father
and was brought down the river on a
barge from the first site of the plant
to the «present one in upper Allegheny.

The roof garden is for the em-
ployes to spend the few hours of rec-
reation during the day. Flowers and
plants are seen here like those of a
park in mid—summer, lending a dis-
tinct diversion for the workersafter
a day’s labor. ’

To tell of all there is to be seen
would take a great amount of space,
but not least to be mentioned in the
visit is the pickle factory, peanut but-
ter department, the baked bean can-
nery and the

He appealed to his audience especi-
ally the students of ethics and socio-
logy) that in their critic_ism about
foreign countries tobe posted on the
present condition of affairs rather
than judge them for their remote an-

cestors. His quotation was very ap-

propriate:

“There is somuch of evil in the best
of us,

And so much of good» in the worst
of us, '

That it doesn’t behoove any of us
To talk about the rest of us.”

He said the Hindus had a proud an-
cestory. They had a civilization of
their own when some of the other
nations.were immersed in ignorance.
They had their own architecture; he
spoke about the skyscraper ‘temples of
Southern Ind-ia. He made reference
to the ancient sanscrit books in which
the theory of organic evolution was
discussed. Touching on the old sys-
tem of election by ballots, he talked
about the Prenchayets.

He believes India will regain her
former prestige by ‘broad and liberal
education, and that to-day Hindu
students were going abroad to get ‘he
best they can from the ou.tside world.
A good many of them were in America
not merely to acquire a book educa-
tion, but to imbibe the ideal American
student spirit and get an insight of
the true American civic life. He is
a racy speaker, is inclined to be elo-
quent and humorous.

He expressed his admiration for
Woodrow Wilson in these words:
“What India demands to-day is, the
man who has a head to think and plan,

a heart to feel and sympathize, a hand

to do and accomplish. In other words,
a man like Woodrow Wilson.”

places throughout the country. This
was followed by a feed.

Each of the “57 varieties” were set
before the class in a manner ﬁt for
kings. Each in its turn they ate,

and pickles; chilisauce, tomato soup,
spaghetti and crackers. '

mistake in this respect is the expecta-

tion of ridding ourselves of the ﬂy by
means of screen doors and windows,
thus making summer prisons out of
our homes. Perhaps the greatest
harm done by the ﬂy is the poisoning
of dairy supplies which very readily
infect children who use these dairy
supplies as food.

' “The movement to exterminate the
ﬂy is of vital importance to the
American people. It must be made a
country wide‘ movement and without
doubt will be in the near future. At
the present time experiments are be-
ing carried on to clean out the ﬂy
from the low swamps in the neighbor-
hood of cities. By some effort mos-
quito breeding swamps are turned in-
to «parks, healthful in every respect.
There are many different kinds of

' ﬂies, but the common house ﬂy is by

far the most dangerous. One boy
caught over 10,000 stable ﬂies over the
head of one cow in a day, which
number of ﬂies draws over a pint of
blood a day from any animal.

“The ﬂy spits forth a ﬂy saliva over
any object it desires to eat, dissolves
what it can of it, and leaves the _rest
If the ﬂy comes across
anything that looks more inviting to
it, it will throw up what it already
has eaten to partake "of the more in-
viting food. The ﬂy leaves germs
wherever it puts its feet or body.
Very much typhoid fever is carried
by -the ﬂy. The methods of dealing
with the fly in order to exterminate
it are very simple and practicable.
The best one is a combination of a
ﬂy trap and a garbage can. That is,
place the little ﬂy traps over an open-
ing in the garbage can and soon thou-
sands of ﬂies, will be caught in it. One
trap of this kind picked up over 16,000
the first day. It is a vacuum cleaner
for the air.”

THE COMMON DRINKING CUP.

Several states and cities have en-

acted laws or adopted regulations re-

garding the use of common drinking
cups in public or semipublic places.
In this connection the following quo-
xtation from a report made by ‘Dr.
Henry Albert, state bacteriologist of
Iowa, appearing in the quarterly bul-
letin of the Iowa State Board of
Health (Vol. XXV, No. 2), is of in-

‘terest:

“Microscopic examinations of 22
common drinking vessels from public
places were made. The vessels were
obtained from two different cities in
Iowa, in one of which there were a
large number of cases of diphtheria.
The vessels were obtained from the
following kinds of places: six from
hotels, 1 from a court house, 1 from
a cigar store, 1 from a railway car,
12 -from public schools, and 1 from a
public well.

The following represents the kinds
of disease—producing bacteria and the
number of cups on which such were
found: Diphtheria bacilli on 2 (both
cups were from school houses of a
city in which there were a large num-
ber of cases of diphtheria); pus—pro-
(lucing bacteria on 17; pneumococci
(itghe germs of pneumonia)
microscoccus catarrhalis (the germ
which frequently‘ produces colds) on

07. In addition, 7 of-the cups con-

tained epithelial cells
from the mouth.”
The Iowa State Board of Health at
a meeting held in _October, 1911,
adopted the following regulation:
“Vi/hereas it has been demonstrated
that common drinking cups are fre-
quently contaminated with disease-
producing germs and, as a medium for
the transmission of contagious and in-
fectious diseases, they are a source of
danger to the public health; and
Whereas individual or private
drinking cups may readily be provided
in such places where most needed;
Therefore, under the authority of

and mucus

the statute -imposed upon the State

Board of Health to promulgate rules
and regulations relative to the pre-
servation of the publichealth in con-
tagious and infectious diseases and the
prevention of the same, the use of
the common drinking cup in all pub-
lic places such as parks, streets,
sch-ool houses, hotels, factories,‘work—
shiops, libraries, railway stations. and
cars, and all otheripublic places is
hereby prohibited from and after Jan-
uary ‘, 1912.” '

Mr. Paul Chowey, president of the
Cosmopolitan club, addressed the
young ladies of the Y. VV. C. A., at
their regular meeting on Monday. Mr.
Chowey had great forethought in
ch-oosing his subject. He realized
what would be of interest to the
young ladies and spoke on “The P0-
sition of the Women in India.” An
interesting discussion followed Mr.
Chowey’s remarks about the position
of the missionaries in his ‘country.
Mr. Chowey felt that as a whole the
missionary movement was beneﬁcial
to the natives, but that the mission-
aries themselves often failed in their
purpose to be one of -the people.

MONEY AND BANKING CLASS
GOES ON INSPECTION TRIP

 

Last Saturday Dr. Holdsworth’s
class in money and banking made a
visit of inspection to_ the Clearing
House, the Stock Exchange and the
First National Bank. The class was
treated with the utmost courtesy by
these institutions’ and nothing was
left undone in the way of explaining
details‘ of the various systems. Mr.
Hall, the well-known Pittsburgh

. broker, made an interesting “address

to the class. The class was taken into
the vault of the above bank and per-
mitted to see what ‘color a $1,000 bill
was. The door -on this vault weighs
seventeen tons and is so nicely bal-
anced» that it can be moved with the
ﬁnger. ' ‘

and democracy.

I hope that strong papers may be
submitted in behalf of all existing sys-
tems (with suggested improvements in
the matter of detail), and that equally
there may be plans submitted for an
entirely different system of divisi-on, as
well as plansthat would argue for no
systems at all.

The manuscripts should be sub-
mitted in typewritten form and signed
‘by a nom de guerre, thereal name be-
ing inclosed in .a separate. envelope.
In any case where, for obvious reasons
a contributor doesiinot desire. to reveal
his identity, his preference will be con-

sidered, even in the event of his win-

ning the prize. _
The competition will close June 2
and ‘the announcement of the winners

will be made in the Sunday Times of ‘

June 9. _

I am glad to announce that the Hon.
Otto T.VBannard, Mr. Norman Hap-
good and Prof. Henry Fairﬁeld Os-

born have generously contributed -their

services and will act as a jury.
From time to time, as the answers
warrant it, The Times will
them during the progress of the com-
petition. Owen Johnson.

spoke very praisingly of those who
had worked under his direction. He
said in part:

“The play this year in my estima-
tion has been as near perfect as it is
possible for an amateur play to be.”
Retiring President L. C. Wagoner,
’l4, made a few brief remarks as did
President—elect Wasson.

Dr. Ashbrook said the prospects at
this time are exceedingly bright for
an extensive trip next year and it is
my hope and ambition to take the
club as far east as Harrisburg and
probably to Philadelp'hia.

A vote of thanks was extended to
J. Woodman Thompson, ’12, the
author of the play, for his hard, en-
ergetic work in behalf of the club.
In response to a call for a speech he
expressed high esteem for all the

they had presented his play.

Other speakers were R. R. John-
son. "14’, retiring secretary, and J. VV.
Philipbar, ’l2, the leader of the or-
chestra.

The results of the election of offi-
cers was highly gratifying to the

members and for the way in which‘

.members as all those elected have

been identiﬁed with the club for sev-

eral seasons and are known to be
hard, consisteiit workers and the
right men for the positions. The re--

sults of the election was as follows:
