Debaters Clash
In Six-Man Tilt

Men Meet Catholic University At
East Liberty YMCA

 

 

 

Speakers from Catholic university
of Washington, D. C., and the Mens
Debating association clashed in the
ﬁrst local intercollegiate debate of
the year, Saturday evening at 8:00
o'clock, in the East Liberty YMCA.

Presenting the affirmative case,
Catholic argued that the essential
features of the NIRA should be made
permanent. A three-man negative
team, composed of Harold Rutten-
berg, C35; Israel Goldberg, C36, and
Norman Landy, C34, from the asso-
ciation, opposed Catholic. _

Yesterday afternoon an extension
debate was presented before the
Twelfth Ward League of Vvomen Vot-
ers. James Boyle, C35, and Abraham
Bonder, C34, upheld the afﬁrmative
case. On the opposing side were
Daniel Dixon, C35, and Norman Landy,
C34.

On Monday evening, March 5, the
second intercollegiate debate will be
presented in Pittsburgh when the
University of Cincinnati opposes Pitt.
In the afternoon an extension debate
will take place before the Fourteenth
Ward League of Women Voters.
Speakers for the two debates have
not been announced.

Fire   Razes Kappa

Sigma House,

Damages Estimated At $5,000

Saturday Blaze Blamed On
Faulty Wiring; Repair
Work Started

Repairmen moved into the Kappa
Sigma fraternity house yesterday
morning after the worst fraternity
ﬁre in recent years swept through the
entire rear part of the house early
Saturday morning, endangering the
lives of ﬁfteen sleeping students, and
destroying property to the extent of
$5,000.

Awakened by Joe Spock, janitor and
handy man for the house, at 6:30
o’clock, the ﬁfteen Pitt students es-
caped through smoke-ﬁlled halls be-
fore ﬁremen arrived on the scene.
All of them attempted to get out their
clothing and valuables before the
smoke became too dense, and three
of them, trapped in separate rooms,
were carried down ladders from the
second floor to the ground. George
Stocker, BA35, Charles Martin, D36,
and Ted Dailey, former Pitt football
end, were the ones rescued by ﬁre-
men. Others succeeding in getting
their clothing safely through windows
to the ground before smoke forced
them to retreat.

Three rooms on the ﬁrst ﬂoor and
parts of three rooms on the second
ﬂoor were completely destroyed. Fur-
niture aiid parts of the house were
damaged by smoke and water, making
extensive repairs necessary. The
plumbing system, electricity, and gas
were damaged so much that the ﬁre
chief ordered them shut off over the
week-end.

Paul M. Baker, BA35, treasurer of
the house, said that the loss to the
house was covered by insurance.

Upon hearing about the blaze, prac-
tically every other fraternity house on
the campus offered its services and
hospitality to the Kappa Sigmas. The
Phi Delta Thetas, across the street,
furnished shelter and breakfast to the
pajama—clad men While ﬁremen were
still busy in the house, Neighbors
also offered places for the men to stay
until they were able to move back
into the house.

Most of the men moved to the

houses of town members, where they,
will stay until repairmen make pro‘-3

visions for them back in the house.
A temporary lighting system was in-
stalled by the insurance company for
the beneﬁt of four men who stayed in
the house over the week-eiid. Cold
running water in two rooms was also
provided.

A rushing dance scheduled at the
house Saturday evening was given,
instead, in the Tent club and carried
on as though nothing had happened.

George said, “that the ﬁrst course in
petroleum engineering in the world
was offered here at the University of
Pittsburgh, in 1912. Dr,
Johnson, former head of the oil and
gas department, was the head of the
ﬁrst petroleum engineering depart-
ment.”

Mr. George mentioned the forma-
tion of petroleum engineering schools
at other universities. The second was

Chancellor Bowman Designates
Cathedral Ground Floor
Room For Use

The School of Mines has establish-
ed, with the cooperation of the Nat-
ural Gas Men’s association of Penn-
sylvania, a new laboratory for instruc-
tion and research in natural gas en-
gineering,

Several weeks ago John G. Bow-
man, Chancellor of the University,
designated a large room situated on
the ground ﬂoor of the Cathedral to
be permanently used as the natural
gas laboratory,

The several natural gas companies
of Pennsylvania which comprise the
Natural Gas Men’s association of
Pennsylvania have donated to the Un-
iversity the complete equipment for
the laboratory.

J. W. Brown, a former student of
the University, has donated for the
laboratory a complete niotor—driven
compressor unit. VVithin a few
weeks, the School of Mines will have
in operation one of the most com-
plete natural gas laboratories in the
country,

A complete four—year curriculum in
natural gas engineering as a third op-
tion in the oil and gas department has
been outlined by Harold C. George,
head of the oil and gas department,
and next fall freshmen will be ad-
mitted to the new course.

The laboratory will be under the
supervision of Mr. George, who came
to Pittsburgh last fall from the Uni-
versity of Oklahoma, where he had
been director of the school of petro-
leuiii. Research work in natural gas
engineering will be started immediate-
ly.

Why Censorship?

ENSORSHIP IS A HORRID WORD—to paraphrase

a Carnegie Tech slogan prominent on the Univer-
sity campus last year. Censorship has become a “bogey
man” to keep intelligent people away from the movies.
Censorship that operates to ruin the continuity of a well-
conceived picture but fails to eliminate utterly boring
slapstick and false billboard representation does not
deserve the power of ultimatum given it today by state
law.

Censorship, as it exists, is largely a quibble over
technical details of a subject uncontrollable in its larger
aspects. Its aims, in part, are to prevent the lowering
of public morals, a growth in crime, and the leading
astray of American youth. Obviously, these are aims
hardly to be realized by any group of selected persons,
no matter how irreproachable their personal qualiﬁca-
tions might be. VVhat, in any given movie, would lower
public morality? What would directly cause a growth
of criminal activities? What would have the effect of
leading astray the children who see the movie"?

In the ﬁrst place, ideas about just what scenes, what
dialogue, might have bad results in the actions or the
beliefs of people seeing the movie would vary according
to the preconceived ideas of the censors. Multiply by
thousands the differences of opinion among the censors
themselves and you have the differences in reaction of
the people who will see the movie. Each censor can
answer only for his own ideas of right and wrong; each
spectator should be allowed the same responsibility.

GAIN, WHAT BASIS IS THERE for the belief that
the moving pictures as conceived and presented by
their producers are sent out with the sole aim of degrad-
ing unsuspecting innocents who go to the theater for
some more or less peaceful entertainment? Books, news-
papers and the legitimate stage take their own responsi-
bility for what is presented through their medium. They
judge for themselves the ﬁtness of what they produce,
and any action against them is brought after the release
of their products. It is fairly reasonable to believe that
the men who have made such an enormous success of
the movie industry could be relied upon to know the
limits of what the public will accept, just as do book
and newspaper publishers and stage producers.

Finally what are the grounds for the belief that movies
do or have been the cause of criminal actions and of
unhealthy ideas? The movies are merely taking their
turn at being condemned by those people who feel that
the evil in the world would disappear if their own ideas
of living were followed; with such a belief, these people
must pounce upon something tangible which, if abolished

Biddle, assistant to the dean of men, is a man of many
many sides is his hobby of reading the future. Twice

would cause the death of evil. Once it was tobacco, once
scanty bathing suits, once romantic novels which were
condemned and against which wars were raged; the
movies are serving their turn. It is easy enough to ﬁnd
a scapegoat when you wish to reform the world.
ARENTS ARE RESPONSIBLE, at least they account
themselves so, for the leisure hours and entertain-
ment of their children. Movie reviewers usually state
whether or not any given show is suitable for children,
and parents can consult the reviews safely in deciding
the value of a movie, if they feel that the lives of their
children will be deﬁnitely inﬂuenced by the type of movie
they see. That is a point in itself debatable.
Censorship, as it has so far operated, has hindered
what progress the movie industry has made toward
artistic representation. “Scarface,” when shown in Penn-
sylvania, had been mutilated. From a stirring drama in
need of no obvious moralizing it became a lesson to the
feeble-minded in why crime should be avoided; after a
thoroughly satisfactory presentation of the uselessness
of the gangsters life came the oliviously tacked—on moral-
ization by a judge, concerning the “public menace.” Cen-
sorship has showed itself resigned to failure in its
feeble deletions of single words from speeches; the word

may have been gone, but the undesired implication re-_

mained. Censorship treats with movie-goers as if they
were utter imbeciles unable to ﬁnd their way about in
the big, big world.

Let the public decide for itself. It can.

I Student Letters

February 19, 1934.

 

Editor, The Pitt News:

‘The editorials against war in the Tuesday and Friday
issues of the Pitt News last week show some thinking
on the part of some person or persons.

If everybody could see in advance the foolishness of
war, there would be no wars. The recent uprisings in
France and Austria resulted in several thousand need-
less deaths and no beneﬁcial adjustment. Of course this
is an example of a small scale war; a second World War
is just indescribable.

«The war photos appearing in the downtown news-
papers only partially picture the toll of battle. Let's
hope that our children won't have to look at war pic-
tures from a World War worse than the last one. There
will not be much to see in the pictures of future wars;
everything will be wiped out clean.

The truth is told when the News admits that money
cannot be spent for arms without using them. Many
progressive programs could be planned to improve
humanity with the money that is spent on arms.

We will always have fame and fortune seekers in
every country of the world to agitate war——this is why
we have to arm. There are too many examples of bull-
dog warriors to cite, but President Roosevelt can be
cited as a paciﬁst. More men like Roosevelt should
have been born into the world.

Just to prove the attitude of Pitt students toward war,
why don’t you print a blank in the next issue of the
Pitt News to be ﬁlled out and turned into the News’
ofﬁce. Such questions as these could be answered on
this blank: '

1. If another war were declared by U. S. against some
foreign country would you enlist? V

2. Would you ﬁght if the government drafted you into
service and you saw no just cause for our country enter-
ing war? '

3. Do you favor a strong national defense for the
United States?

4. Do you think that the disarmament conferences are
beneﬁcial in stimulating world peace?

5. Do you think war is the only way national or inter-
national disputes can be settled?

This questionnaire will yield some interesting results
and will be well worth the time it takes in tabulating
the results.

Thanking the Pitt News for their interest in estab-
lishing the ideals of paciﬁsm on the campus.

GAL BREATH.

Radio Speaker

The peculiar part of it is that Bid-
dle is almost invariably perfect in his

estimates Last year, after the ﬁrst
semester rush period he estimated
that 500 bids would be submitted and
150 would be accepted. Actual re-
turns were 550 bids, 162 acceptances.

.—._.._

Summer Session
Plans Announced

 

After the second semester season his
estimate was almost a. bulls—eye: 150
bids for 110 men, with 65 acceptances.
The official results were 156 bids
submitted for 110 men (perfect there}
with 64 men pledging. Last semester
the prognostigator declared that 590
bids would go in for 370 men and 190
rushees would say “yes.” He was off
39 on the number of bids, as only 551
were turned in, but 376 men were bid
and 191 had shining pledge buttons
aﬁixed to their lapels, which still
leaves Biddle with a splendid record.

This semester bids were due in his
office yesterday morning and the num-
ber of acceptances will be announced
tomorrow evening. To insure his
prediction being on the “up” Mr. Bid-
dle assented to make his estimates
Friday afternoon, three days before
bids were submitted and ﬁve days be-
fore acceptances would be recorded.

Here are his figures: 161 bids
should be turned in for 111 men;
59 should accept by WednesdaY
evening, and an additional eight
should accept in the near future.

In the next issue of the News will
be found the actual number of bids
submitted yesterday morning and the

numlqzr of rushees who were ad-
vanced invitations to pledge to frater-
nities. The number of acceptances
will not be available until Friday.

1934 Program Includes Study Of
Current Problems

The announcement of the 1934 Uni-
versity Summer Session was released
by the Summer Session office this
week. The program of courses in-
cludes three two-week campus ses-

sions, the regular session of
weeks, eight-week science courses,
ten-week courses for engineers, a

downtown evening session, and branch
sessions at the Johnstown and Erie
Centers, at the nature study camp
near Ligonier, at the surveying camp
near Vvindber, and at the Lake and
Marine laboratories on Presque Isle
near Cape Cod.

The University has recognized that
many summer students will desire to
direct their study, in part or in whole,
to problems of current interest. The
professional courses in education that
will be offered afford unusual oppor-
tunity for the consideration of the
many problems which confront public
school teachers and executives at the
present time The classroom lectures
and discussions, seminars, group con-
ferences, and the opportunities for in-
dividual study and research have all
been planned with this in mind, In
the academic ﬁelds, particularly in
the social sciences, matters of current
economic, political, and social inter-
est to all will be studied. Courses in
commerce, economics, ﬁnance, polit-
ical science, and sociology have in-
cluded the consideration of these cur-
rent problems.

what price glory . . .

Bob Machesney, ex-editor of this
sheet, has arrived back from a mid-
west trip, and reports the low down
on a little Univ publicity he’s noticed

. This week's Sattidy Evening
Pest has a story about a mid-west-
ern university. In the article is the
comment that no Eastern schools have
good basketball teams; it goes on to
state, except Pitt, but we in the mid-
west claim her! Ha.-cha-chat
And the next Book Of The Month of,-
fering is by a Smith college grad who
titled it, “I ‘Went To Pit College” . . .
sounds good, but there’s a catch. The
story is about the Western Pennsyl-
vania coal regions, and has no con.
nection with our institute of higher
education .
for a little guy . . .

This fellow Hy Cohen sure gets the
Publicity. While snooping around the
mail box in 801 Friday, we came
across a card which stated that a
Washington, D. C. Newspaper ran an
interesting article about him, and if
he would include a dime and a three
cent stamp the clipping agency would

mail him the article. What price
glory?
more glory . . .

There happens to be a mess of

famous names in our dear student
body, for a sample: Jack Denny, 220
swim champ, doesn't know a thing
about orchestras except to dance to

another orchestra is the one

made famous by that ace of ace
comedians Jack Benny, our own Frank
Black . . . some dance can advertise
that Jack Denny and Frank Black will
be there and clean up . . . what price

glory?
still more . . .

article on the symphony of University
noise published in the latest Pitts-
burgh Record. Personally, we’ve heard
the noises, and can think of many
other things to call them besides

tinguished scholars in the ﬁeld of
mechanical engineering. His re-
search on steam, and the tables pub-
lished from these researches were ac-
cepted as the highest authority in
this ﬁeld for many years. Dr. Davis
is making a tour of the country visit-
ing the different student branches of"
the American Society of Mechanical
Engineers.

Following the talk to the Pitt en-
gineers, Dr. Davis will attend 3. din-
ner in his honor given by the alumni
of Stevens Institute at the Pittsburgh
Athletic association. Mr, S. J. Tracy

of the mechanical engineering depart-
ment Who is a Stevens graduate and

lar meeting of the student branch of
ASME in Room 817, Cathedral, at
_11:30 the speaker will be Mr. W. L.
Batt, vice president of the ASME
and head of the SKF Industries——one
of the world’s greatest manufacturers
of anti—friction bearings. Mr. Batt is
a leading authority on this subject
and his talk should be a great inter-
est to all engineering students.

to seeing them.

How quickly you’ll snap back to normal!
A telephone “voice visit” can brighten your
