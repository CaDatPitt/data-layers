Inquiry Hears
Catholic View

“A flrm,~1I _eli'ef in the divinity of
Jesus (_‘l1I-izstfis the fundamental doc-
trine 0'I' tlle Catholic church," de-
(;l3I‘t*(l Father Sigmund Cratz, of the
De Paul Institute of Brookline, in
answeriiig “VVha.t is Catholicism" at
the Inquiry Forum Vi-"ednesday after-
noon,

The punpose of the mother church,
according-to Father Cra.tz, is three-
fold. “It. aims to redeem mankind
througli sin, to save mankind and to
teach mankind the truth,” he said.
“Yet Christ wanted to carry on his
work througli all time, so that he

founded the church as a. perfectly‘

formed society.”

In dealing with the relation of
Ctatholicism to modern social prob-
lems, Father Cratz stressed the
humane. work carried on by church
workers in their missions and charity.
“The grea,test_..intege’st of Catholics is
the poor, because“so many of ' our‘
members are only common people.
Catholics were the first to protest
against poverty, against slavery and
again.st oppression," the priest said.

As for the future of Catholic doc-
trine. the speaker said only, “The
Catholic church stands before the
world serene and unafraid. Its future
is bright. just as its past has been
ﬁlled with great and holy names.”

Father Cratz’s discussion was the
third and concluding -religious. talk in
the Inquixiy Fortlim series.» Previous
speeches, in which Rabbi B. B. Glazer,
of the Rodef Shalom congregation. ex-
plained Judaism, and in which Rev.
Dr. David Lang, of the Shady Ave-
nue Presbyterian church, dealt with
Protestantism, rounded out the three-
week program.

Plans For Model
Congress Delay ed

 

 

Mock _ Political Convention
Suspended by Elections

After wecks- of extensive prepara-
tion, program building, and publicity,
Pitt's mock "political congress spon-
S0I‘9(1 by the YMCA today faced possi-
ble dissolution before c.on\'oca.t1(.m.

Plans for the proposed student cou-
vention, which was to have taken
place during the latter part of April.
to give campus men and women op-
portunity to air their political and
economic views, ran into a. snag yes-
terday when several complications
arose on account of the imminent
cabinet elections.

John P. Bracken, Col. who.
along with John D. Paulus, Col, '34,
and Rudolph Morgan, -Col. ’3J., was in
cliarge of completing arrangements
for the conclave commented on the
situation this morning with the state-
ment tltat, “No YMCA officer can car-
ry on the duties in this division under
the conditions of uncertainty existing
in that organization today. It is re-
lgretful to announce that Pitt's first
mock congress will be postponed
pending YMCA elections this week.”
. The Congress, if it takes place, is
scheduled to bring outstanding local
politti-cal leaders. and ~statesmeI1._to -the
Cam'])1lS' in a discussion oi‘ -pertinent.
problems facing Mr. Roosevelt's ad-
xmiuistration at the present time. Sim-
ilar affairs which took place on the
campus before were among the lar-
gest events of their kind ever pre-
sented here.

the first time, from Memorial Hall
to the Stadium, where more than
_10,000 persons attended the outdoor
exercises.

Invitations to the commencement
exercises in the Stadium will be un-
limited in number.

In case of rain, however, the pro-
gram will be shifted to the Mosque
where the seating Vcapracity is approx-

ima.t,el_v 3,000, which will enable both,

parents of each graduate to attend.

gram. will be the traditional Senior

Service Is Watchword Of
Plodding Russian Peasants

By JACK BUNKER

 

Service! That is the battle cry in
Russia today.

In that rapidly-expanding Soviet
Union, where machinery is almost
as important to the people as life
itself, and much more romantic, in-
dustry is emphasized throughout the
nation,“ and in industrializlng. their
huge country under the project of the
ﬁve-year plan, the Russian workers
compete with each other to do the
most for the fatherlancl. In keeping
with this national spirit, the laying
of a factory cornerstone or the com-
pletion of a railroad is celebrated
throughout the country by proclama-
tion, posters, radlo, speeches and gala
demonstrations without end.

Prafulla C. Mukerji, a Pitt graduate
ot'~the class of 1914, has .just recent-
ly returned from a seven months‘
stay in the Ural Mountains, where
he was employed by the Russian gov-
ernment at Magnitogorsk, in the
construction of the great Magnitostrcy
mills, which will, upon completion, be
the largest in Europe.

Three years ago, on the present
site of this plant, there was nothing
but a desolate community of Ta1‘ta1's,
living in dugouts. Now Magnitogorsk

Engineering Alumni Plan

Three Dollar Dues Cut,

In preparation for the. meeting of
the University Engineering‘ Alumni
Association which will take place
dnring.Sen'lor Week in June the day
before Commencement, the executive
board has drawn up a proposal calling
for the reduction of membership dues
from ﬁve to two dollars a year. A
change in the Constitution of the As-
sociation makes such a. reduction
practically mandatory.

The principal interest of the Asso-
ciation at present is the projected
Stewart Engineering. Laboratory
which it plans to have built in the
future. This building, which will oc-
cupy the space between Thaw Hall
and Mellon Institute, is expected to
aid materially in the work of the un-
dergraduate School.

Frosh » Hop Committee ».

   

Committeemen for the Fresh-
man Dance of two weeks ago who
have not yet fully accounted for
all tickets and money, are to re-
port at the office of the dean of
men today and clear up any
deficiencies. According. to Emil
Meacham, chairman, this must be
done this afternoon,

 

has arisen. an apartment city of 200,-
000 and as modern as contemporary
engineers can make it. It ha.s schools,
hotels, stores, restaurants, play-
grounds and even :1. hospital.

The mill Magnitostroy itself is a
triumph of American and Russian en-
gineering with its eight blast fur-
naces. each of 1,000 tons capacity,
its forty-two open hearths, three
blooming mills and nine ﬁnishing
mills. ‘

Mrs. lliukerji found Russian en-
gineers too absorbed in their work
to care what kind of a. government
they had; the common workers, he
discovered, were well fed, paid and
housed; while somewhat sober, they
are very friendly and eager to learn.
And of the much talked of military
rule, this American engineer found
very little; equally absent was private
property. ..Wages, he». «found, were
practically the same between bosses
and "bossed."

Aside ‘from the amiable and earnest
character of the Russian people, what
impressed Mr. Mukerjl most was the
breaking down of any distinction be-
tween the owner and producer
classes. The emphasis of labor in-
stead of on capital, Mr. Mukerji be-

lieves, is a step forward in ‘world L

progress.

Spring Practice Sessions

 

I00 Gridclers Appear on Mud Filled Field
To Begin Workouts; 35 Varsity,
33 Frosli, 32 New Men Out

 

Under very unwelcome conditions, Spring practice at the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh began Wednesday afternoon on the practice

ﬁeld.

A sudden change of wcatlier which made the temperature near
freezing, added to a sharp wind blowing over the field, and a great

deal of unnecessary mud, greeted

more than 100 varsity, freshman,

and novice players as they appeared for the initial practice period.

Gathering his corps of assistants¢

around him, Dr. John B. Sutherland‘
oﬁicfially opened Spring practice forl
the Golden Panthers. warning the;
shivering gri-dders the fashion in;
which they attended practice wouldé
determine its length. i

After urging the players to attend
faithfully their lessons in football,
guards, tackles, freshmen and new;
players, and backﬁeld men were para;
celed out among assistants. Dr. Ros-g
coe "Skipper" Gougler, Andy (}ii.~ziat'-:
son, Ralph Montgomery, Ralph
Daugherty, Joe. Doncliess_ and Bill
Kern to begin an hour's workout on,
the sodden ﬁeld. 

Of the 100 hundred gridclcrs arr,-
pcarlng at the first spring practice pe- ;
riod  were former varsity, 33 frosli, 
and 32 were classed as new players. 1

And so the first Spring practice ses- ,
siou of 1933 was called to order. §

Under the direction of these seven;
teachers of football. plans for the;
forthcoming football season will be!
outlined during the six weeks’ work-{
out period for the forthcoming sea-!
son. Plays will be outlined and the’
period .will .be.,climaxed with it full
time grid battle between two picked
‘teams at the close of the practice pe-
riod.

For two days preceding the opening
of the workouts on the practice ﬁeld,
Percy St. Clair Brown, custodian of
equipment at the stadium, and his
corps of assistants doled out athletic
equipment to the appearing gridders.
Frosli were given uniforms lliouday
afternoon; the varsity were issued
equipnient the following afternoon.

The’ following -‘players appeared for :
the first practice drill Wednesday aft-
crnoon.

Former Dean of Men
Greets Swimmers
At Rutgers

Pitt swimmers renewed friendships
with former dean of men Robert C.
Clotliier, now president of Rutgers
University, when they were in New
Brunswick, New Jersey, last week-end
competing in the Eastern Collegiate
Swimming Association champioon-
ships.

The now president-Clothler spent a
great deal of time with the varsity
swimmers, renewing acquaintance-
ships and generally looking out for
their welfare. Before the meet he
wished them success, but even the
support of the Rutger’s president
failed to swing victory over to the
Panthers, Coach Corr’:-3 natators ﬂu-
isliing in second place in a ﬁeld of 13
teams entered.

Dr. Clothier expressed himself as
very well pleased with his work at
Rutgers and asked the swimmers to
convey his best wishes back to his
l2‘l"l(-‘.l.1dr3 at Pitt.

Nlatmen Meet

Sewickley Y

Panther Wrestlers in Second
Hatch ol Season

Following their disastrous experi-
ence at ’\Vayiiesburg last Friday night
when they lost a 35-5 decision, the
newly organized Pitt wrestling team
meets its first opponent on the come-
back trail in the persons of the
Sewickley Y grap-piers at .,Sewlckley
tonight.

No changes are planned in the Pitt
lineup for this match, and as no in-
juries were sustained in the Waynes-
burg meet, the entire squad is intact,
The match with Sewickley Y was
originally scheduled to precede the
'\Va.yziesbu1‘g match, but was later
cancelled, only to be rescheduled for
tonight.

Thiessen, of Pitt will meet Alexan-
der, ot‘ Sewickley in the opener, the
118-pound class. Yeagers, Pitt, and
Ludy, Sewickley, are scheduled for
the 125-pound match. In the 135-
pound class. Coach Hubler will likely
use McQuinn against Grant, of Se-
wickley. Cook, Sewickley, seems to
hold an edge over Illsley in the 145-
pound class, as does Grange, Sewick-
ley, in the 155-pound class. Renton
will represent Pitt in the latter class.

The 165-pound match should prove
one of the highlights of the evening,
with Willets, Pitt, meeting Tiernaii,
Sewickley. =VVil1ets was the lone Pitt
victor in last week's meet, and will
meet with -plenty of opposition from
Tiernan. Cox, Sewicklcy, and Schlent-
nei", Sewickley, will wrestle at 175
pounds. In the closing match of the
evening, in the unlimited class, VVyett_.
Pitt, and Geier, Sewickley, will match
caltchcs and falls.

Morgantownto be Scene
ol: -Meet Toniglil:
and Tomorrow
By Hy Cohen

A grand ﬁnale, a‘.;ccompani,ed by a
wealth of blood and knockouts, in-

stead of the customary drums and;

bugles. will mark the close of the dis-
trict's boxing season. The setting for
the finale is Morgaiitown, West Vir-
ginia, where the ﬁnals for the indi
vidual championships of the Eastern
Intercollegiate Boxing COI1fel'€llCe
will be conducted tonight and to1nor-

— row night.

Semi-final honors will be fought out
tonight, with the ﬁnals scheduled for
Saturday night. at the Mountaineer
ﬁeld hou-se. Seven championships will
be-decided at this time, in the 115,
125, 135, 145, 155, 165, and 175-pound
classes. Four of last year’s cham-
pions will be on hand tonight and to-
morrow night to defend their hard-
earned titles, and the chances are
that few will retain them.

The caliber of material in this
year's tournament is classy in some
weights, and very poor in others, The
115-pound class is dominated by Pete
D’Allesa.ndro, of Temple, National
Collegiate and Eastern Conference
Cliampion. D’Allesaudro should re-
tain his title easily. Others in this
class are Junge, Pitt; Littleliales, W.
& J., and Brain, Duquesne. Of the

last mentioned three, Junge is the '

only one who has a victory to his cred-
it during the past week.

Peter Puglia, West Virginia, will
win the 125-pound championship un-
less the Florida earthquake moves to
the Mountaineer field house. Puglia
is iiiidefeatcd to date. and his oppo-
sition in the featherweight division
will- hardly cause him to extend him-
self. Klieb, Bucknell; Atlas, Car-
negie, and Gibbs, Duquesne, round
out the quartet.

The "lightweight class has what
amounts to the classiest material in
the entire conference. All four en-
trants in the title chase are good
enough to win most. tournaments, and

Jack Scliriclcor

the only ﬂaw is the fact that only
one can become -champion. Neely,
VVest Virginia; Berley, Bucknell;
Carr, Carnegie, and Giannatti, Pitt,

comprise the talentin this group. Of

Scliriclcer, Gign.no,H:i_, and
Junge Seel:'C-rowns
For Pill:

the four, Berley is possibly the only
one with a, punch that amounts ‘to
anything. Beloﬁ‘, Teniple, l”a’s‘t year's
champion, will not defend his crown
at Morgantown. Any one of the four
can win the title.

The welterweight, or 145-pound
class, lacks the high type of material
found in the 135-pound class, with
-Moore, Duquesne, appearing almost
certain to retain his crown. \Vilken-
son, Bucknell; Hamilton, West Vir-
ginia, and Fischoil‘, Temple, are the
remaining entrants in this class. Tem-
ple's chances of gaining a champion-
ship would bc much better if they
shifted in Catanzaro instead of
Fischoff.

Jack Sc-liricker, Pitt, will meet with

considerable opposition when he dc-.

fends his title tonight. Gallo, VVe.st
Virginia. who holds two decisions
over Schricker, appears to be the new
champion, if a new one is crowned.
Riimora, Duquesne, and Luppion, W.
8.: J., seem to be merely ﬁll-ins for
this class. The fatal possibility is
tliat Gallo and Scliricker, admittedly
the two best in their class, will be
matched for tonight, eliminating one,

and giving eitherlRuinora or Luppion‘

a chance for second place. However,
to ward against “I told you sos,” Ru-
mora or Luppion may be the finalists.

There are two standouts in the 16’-
pound division, Dalles, W’. & J., and
Voorhees, Vvest Virginia. Kubacki,
Bucknell, and
will hardly cause any trouble.

The light-liczn'yweiglit bouts should:

produce plenty of action with Pil-
conis, Temple; Paynes. West Vir-
ginia, and Demedo'wit.z,‘-VV. & J. Un-
less afourth ﬁghter is uncovered for
this class, one will draw a bye.
Basing a prediction on past perform-u
ances, Payne should win. '

Pairings for tonights’ tights will be
made at a meeting’ of the various
coaches and managers this afternoon
at Morgantown.

Panthers Gain Two Positions
On First Conference Five

The Pitt basketball team, champions
of the Eastern Intercollegiate Basket-
ball Conference, gained additional

Conference teams: Dr. H. C. Carl-
son, Pitt; Max Hannum, Carnegie

Mesmer, Georgetown; Francis Stads-
vold, W’ est Virginia.

Howard “Red” Rosan, Temple,
leading scorer of the loop, was the
only player to receive the unanimous
votes of the coaches for the first
team, each coach giving him five
votes. I-largarden, of Georgetown, a
guard, Don Smith, and Clare Cribbs
each received 23 votes. Jimmy Fer-
gus, Tech guard, and remaining mem-
ber of the ﬁrstteam received 18 votes,

An alternate team was chosen, con-
sisting of: Bob Smith, Tech, and
Jimmy Brown,
Len Gudd, Temple, center; Don Mc-
Cainant, Pitt, and Wllblll' Sortet, West
Virginia, guards. Ochsenhirt, Panther
center and guard, and “Whitey” Wil-
son, forward, received honorable men-
tion ratings.

Pitt Chess Club Divides

A close victory over the Pittsburgh

YMHA were the results of the last
two matches of the Pitt chess team.
Although Roger and Bradford Ilsley
were the only University men to top-
ple the Y opposition, Robert McClur-
kin, H. J. Rube, Roger Haley, and A.
Brandon came through in the down-
town match to defeat the local lead-
ers 4-3.

The Pitt group met Schenley High

night at 7:30, and will encounter the

¢til1 the last part of the game.

The game tonight, besides closing
the 1932-33 season, will be the ﬁnal
collegiate appearance of Captain Don
Smith, popular Panther cage leader.
Tonight's game will be Smith's eighth
appearance against 9. Tartan ﬂoor
team, two of the appearances being
made while a. member of the fresh-
man squad. In the seven games al-
ready played, the Panthers have been
winners in each case, and unless

A large Bellevue delegation is ex-

OF THEE l SING

Regardless of one’s sym-p’athies with
Socialism, Communism, Labor, or with
so-called American Democracy, who-
ever sees Of Thee pl. Sing will be
caught at once into the pure humor
of this ridicule of American institu-
tions. Critics have been telling us
‘all that nothing quite like it has
ever appeared. We are accustomed,
of course, to the ci'itic’s excitement
over eve1‘ything——-or i'a.the1', we have
observed him being almost forced in-
;to making 3, noise over every pretty
pebble. In regard to O'f Thee I Sing,
though, he seems to have justice with
"him. It is an original production.
-There is an Aristophanian spirit about
‘it that hasn't appeared since the The-
ter Guild version of Lysistrata, when
old Aristophanes himself walked the
'boards, a. spirit that carries back to
the full, racy, ridiculous fun-making
of the Greeks. The particular fash-
ion of playing up the supreme court
judges rcoccurs almost exactly like
some of Aristophanes’ choruses of
old men. The satire, perhaps is 3.

Council Protests

ROUSED over what one of its mc-mbcrs intcrpi'cted ascn ap-
parent attcmpt to “railroad” soinethiiig through against stu-
dent opinion, Student Council saw ﬁt \Vcdncsc1a.y night to voice a
formal protest against the Univc1'sil'y’s ma.nnc'i- of deciding on the
type of diploma that is to be received by the June graduating class.
During the past week, mcinbcrs of the senior class from the
College, the Schools of Education, Engineering, Mines, Business Ad-
ministration, and the Graduate School, have been privileged to view
a new type diploma that is under consideration for use this June.
The new sheepskin, measuring only eight by ten inches in size-,fis
described as an exact reproduction of the original “wall typc"’
diploma, and is designed to fit into a folder’ of blue morocco leather
that-is lined with silk moirc.- The "name of the recipient will be
engraved in gold leaf on thcoutside of the folder. « 

Of the representatives of the above groups which met and voiced
their preferences on the old and new type diplomas, only those of
the College and the School of Education failed to approve. i;he, small,
book-type model. The professional schools did n_ot vote, since tlipy
are to retain the old style sheepskin regardless of any changes in
other schools. But because “a. rcpi.'csent.ai:ivc expression of opinion ;
was not possible,” due to the small proportion of the College illlfll
Education seniors in attendance, Registrar Quick this week asked
seniors in the two disapproving schools to voice their preference as
they apply at the Dean ’s office for graduation.

Both those who have applied for graduation and. those who have
yet to do so before Monday “will be given the opportunity to ex-
amine the new diploma and register their p1'efcrcnce,” the regis-
trar’s announcement stated. It was not explained what inﬂuence
their choice would have on the ﬁnal decision.

This lack of knowledge as to just what force their individual
votes would carry, and the objection that there was not even the
assurance of an optional choice for each senior, brought the coun-
cilmanic majority to its feet in protest.

If the University is to decide ﬁnally on the type of diploma we
are to have, there is, obviously, no point in registering ii. student
preference. If, however, the results of the continuing poll arc io
shape the decision, a, simple statement to that effect might go far
toward. clearing up much of the misunderstanding.

l Time To Think I
OSTPONEMENT of the first College Association dance to March
31, the date so recently reopened by cancellation of the Military

Ball, adds another fortnight to our social breathing spell.

Thanks to the Lenten season and a ﬁnancial crisis, the Pitt stu-
dent with social aspirations has been temporai'il_v relieved of 11 bur-
densome Friday night responsibility. Pending the arrival of Spring
festivities, he may now go back to thirty-ﬁve cent lunches and phys-
ical rclaxation. - ~ -

Faces already appear less strained. With the ticket hawker out
of sight, student groups mingle once more in our halls witli an air
of conﬁdence that cannot go unnoted.» Again athletics comes into:
its own as a subject of undergraduate speculation. There are even
reports of an up-turn in scholastic interest. It appears that some-
thing has been accomplished. We are approaching nornialcy, thanks
to one display of intelligent foresight.

Student Council officially approved this n1orato'ri'u’ininstituted
by the Military Ball committee in a unanimous vote commending
them for the Ball cancellation. The action may have a touch of
irony for at least one of the cadets, whose recognition in the elec-
tions held VVcdnesd_ay night by Council is slightly puzzling. There

is, obviously, a markedlegislative difference between public votes
of “approval” and secret ballots of election. -

afternoon and evening_

Following the early meeting, Dr. W.

Expect 300 Teachers to_,,At-C
tend Tomorrow--""'

 

The fourth annual History Confer-
ence conducted by the history depart-
ment under Dr. John IV. Oliver will
be held here tomorrow. The build-
ing of the W'e.-stern Pennsylvania His-
torical Society and Heinz House will
be the scene of the assembly.

“The history conference offers the
best opportunity nor bringing together
high school teachers and college pro-
fessors of history in this section,” Dr.
Oliver said yesterday. “VVe provide
for a better understanding of their
problems with a view to the improve-
ment of their teaching of history.”

From 250 to 300 teachers are ex-
Dected to attend the all-day‘ affair.
Beginning tomorrow morning with a

University and Prof. George B. Hat-
ﬁeld of Pitt will feature the afternoon
session. Beta chapter of Phi Alpha
Theta, national honorary history fra-
ternity, will conduct the ﬁnal meet-
ing, at which Mrs. Ruth Crawford
Mitchell, adviser of the nationality
rooms for the Cathedral of Learning,
will speak.

“European History and Its Teach-
ing,” is the general theme of the his-
tory assemblage, Each year, Dr.
Oliver explained, one topic is taken
for discussion, and is dealt with in
every possible way during the one-
day conference. The European back-
ground from its American signiﬁcance
to its relation to VVestern Pennsylva-.

little less severe; there are more
ridiculous situations that 4 bring‘ the
laughs. But then the authors are
hardly tryiilg to be reformers.

Of Thee I Sing strikes its most
tiou. Of it, one thing can deﬁnitely
"be said: That the bulk of humor,
despite the worn device of bathing
beauty choruses, is original in that
it springs organically from the in-
stitutions satirized, and resides in
the exaggerated conception ot'_t_l1ose
institutions. In so many musical

just as well be abst,ra_cted_ andapplied

haxshed and rehearsed on the stage.
But the attitude in Of Thee i sing is
D_eculia.1'; for political campaigns sen-
ate justices of the Supreme Court,
and the Constitution have themselves
become the comedy and not a dull
.sca.recrow for the hanging on of hu-
morous _ spaiigles. '

One ﬁne thing about the. show is
its sharply American tone. It is the
New York burlesque-musical comedy
given a real organized impulse and
raised to the position of actually rep-
resenting an attitude of American
life. The. spirit is infthe air. People
want change.‘ Particularly they want
change in politics. We see this feel-
ing cropping out-.in books like Wash-
ington -Merry-Go-R_ouud, and in the
recent administrative exposes. It is
a. kind of ballyhoo with purpose. Peo-
ple are so roundly beset with diffi-
culties of disorganization and inﬂux

on all sides that the only effective way

to relieve the tension is to laugh. It
is the philosophy in these times. And
as an ovcrtone of the whole matter,
Of Thee l Sing strikes one with its
delight and its entire appropriateness.
Beyond sheer fun, it is a question
whether this type of ridicule may not,
in the long run," 1311.211 some absurd

there was started an industry in 1792

B. N. Montague, member of the

Near the Pitt campus, in Shadyside, ‘ furnace in Allegheny couny commenc-

ed operations in 1792 and was abau
doned in 1794, due to a lack of ore
in this immediate. district. Short-
lived though it was, this was the first
attempt to produce pig iron west or
the Alleghenies.

After the abandonment of this local
furnace, no iron was produced in the.
county until 1859, Mr. Montague
says. In that year the famous Clinton
furnace on the Monongahela began
producing. The_n, 24 years after the
establishment of the first successful
blczst furnace in the county, the dis-

trict had the distinction of being the 1

leading iron producer in the United
‘States. In -1904 Pittsburgh ~ reached
the peak of its importance, producing
at that time 26 per cent of the nu-
tion’s iron. '
