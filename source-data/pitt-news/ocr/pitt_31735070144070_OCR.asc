If you think you’re going to be
able to stop by your polling place
to vote 15 minutes before “class
tomorrow, youmight be in for a
surprise.

According to Rock the Vote,
young voters more than doubled
their turnout in the 2008 primaries
and caucuses. It is estimated that
the turnout for tomorrow’s elec-
tion will be just as high.

But ﬁrst—time voters should
know a few things before they
head to the polls.

College Democrats president
Lissa Geiger said students should
anticipate long lines on Election
Day from the large number of
newly registered voters on campus
this year.

“Sometimes, there can be tech-
nical problems with the voting ma-
chines or people will forget things,
and that can really‘ slow down the
process,” said Geiger.

Pennsylvania accepts numerous
forms of identiﬁcation, including
photo and non-photo options.

First—tirne voters should try to
bring their voter registration card,
but the only  necessary is a
form of identiﬁcation. ‘

Acceptable‘ forms of identiﬁ-
cation range from a Pennsylvania
driver’s license or ID card issued
by PennDOTito a current utility
bill with the address of the voter.

Friday’s Board of Trustees
meeting hit on the high points
of the current academic year and
passed a resolution electing three
Emeriti Trustees to Pitt.

The Board of Trustees elected
Steven C. Beering,  Roger‘Glunt
and Dick Thornburgh as Emeriti

Trustees approve Thornburgh, others

Trustees of Pitt for “exceptional
contributions and service to the
welfare and progress of the Uni-
versity,” said the Board.

The title of emeritus is an
honorary distinction rewarded to
selected trustees. Emeriti trustees
do not partake in board votes.

“These are trustees who have

made such lasting and important

contributions to our community
that the University wishes to rec-
ognize them with this extremely
special and distinguished status,”
said Robert Hill, the vice chancel-
lor of public affairs for Pitt.
“These three gendemen have
been incredibly generous in their
time and talents throughout the
years, and giving them this title

honors their commitment,” said
Pitt spokesman John Fedele.
Thornburgh served as gover-

nor of Pennsylvania and attorney

general of the United States un-
der President Ronald Reagan and
President George H.\X/. Bush. He
donated the Dick Thornburgh

sityin 1988, which is available to

In memoriam:

by Liz Williamson
and Caitlin Kasunich
Staﬂ Wrztera

Those closest to Oliver Hertzel
remember his dedication to and
talent for his sport: wrestling.

As a top—three wrestler in Penn-

Isylvania with more than 150 wins,

Hertzel continuously broke, re-
cords throughout his high school
career at- Council Rock iHigh
School North in ‘Bucks County,

including the record for the num-

- ber of wins in his senior year last

year. . V .
‘ “His accomplishments on the
that were amazing,” said Hayden

Schenker, a" friend of Hertzel’s

who wrestled him in high
school. “He was everything the

younger wrestlers and Iwanted to

be.” , --
Known as “Ollie” to those
who were closest to  Hertzel,
18, died last Monday in an appar-

ent suicide. He was a freshman at
Pitt.

Brian Spencer, another friend
of Hertzel’s and a former student
at Council Rock, recalled one par-
ticular wrestling match against the

school’s rival team that Hertzel C

participated in as a junior and cap-
tain of thepteam. .

‘ As Hertzel walked onto the
mat to face his opponent, the
crowd held its breath. But, when

‘Hertzel pinned his opponent just

Oliver Hertzel

moments later, the fans began to
scream_and chant his name.
“Everybody was so proud of

him,” said Spencer, adding that he
lost his voice that day. “Now ev-

erybody rnisses him.”

Tom Vivacqua, Hertzel’s high
school wrestling coach, said he
remembers when he started to
coach Hertzel in youth programs
when he was 8 years old. Vivacqua
continued to coach Hertzel as he
wrestled on the high school varsity

Gone Voting group
rallies for day off .

by Kelly Thomas
Staff Wrtier

A small group of Carnegie Mel-
lon University students have gone
voting," and they’d like the rest of
Pittsburgh to follow them.

The students, a mix of under-
graduagegf and graduate students,
started Gone Voting to get busi-
nesses toigive employees time off to
vote on Election Day.’

The organization works together
without any elected leaders, said
group member Sarah Kusuma.

Kusuma, a junior design major,
said that she drew inspiration for
the project from a nip to Cambodia.
Cambodian stores closed on their
election day, she said, and the poll
lines were long throughout the day.

“Almost all the people there took
time to vote,” said Kusuma. “We’re
not  time off to celebrate this
big event that’s supposed to impact
our future”

Kusuma likened Election Day to
a holiday and said she doesn’t under-
stand why businesses are closed on

holidays like Columbus Day when
they aren’t for Election Day.

Despite the group’s efforts, how-

ever, she said the project hasn’t been
well received by businesses in Pitts-
burgh. The group spoke to many
businesses, especially small, privately
owned ones, but none of them
agreed to participate '
A few employees‘ from several com-
panies such as McDonald's and
UPMC showed _inter-
est in the program, but
Gone Voting was un-
able to get any manag-
ers involved. .

“Especially with the
economy now, people i ..
are really worried about
taking tithe off to
vote,” said Kusuma

Pitt freshman Caitlin Tirnoney
agreed that work shouldn’t get hi the
way of voting. '

“I think that it’s everybody’s tight
to vote, and no one should have the
power to stop that,” she said.

Many states, such as Alaska,'Col-

All forms of approved identiﬁca-

tion can be found on the Allegh-
eny County Division of Elections
Web site. The Allegheny County
Elections Division did not return
phone calls for an interview.
Students should also be aware
of their_ assigned polling places.
Many lower campus students
vote in Wesley Posvar Hall, while
upper campus students’ polling
place is in Soldiers &

seum and Memorial.

All off-carnpus
_ students should‘ refer
to their voter regis-
tration cards to de-
termine their polling
locations.

All . polling '

places are open from 7‘a.m. to 8
p.m. Even if the wait lasts beyond
8 p.m., anyone in line by that time
is guaranteed the right to vote.
Shannon Martin, coordinator
of Student Vote Coalition, said
that the earlier students go to vote,

Sailors Military Mu—'

the less likely they will have to wait

in long lines.

“College students don’t get out
of bed before 10,” said Martin.
“So, my advice is to vote early and
then you can leave early and have
the rest of the day.”

However, if students want to

sleep in, the Student Vote Coali— .

tion planned different ways to
keep the voters interested and in
line all day long.

The Student Vote Coalition cre-
ated a program for Election Day
called Voter Hospitality to keep
voters interested. The program’s
goal is to do anything they can do
to get voters to stay in line, includ-'

ing offering food, Sudoku puzzles ~

and giving out “as much free stuff
as possible,” said Martin.
Patrick Graham, president of

the College Republicans, also said a

the lines will be long, but voting is

worth the sacriﬁce of waiting.
“Bring a textbook to read so

you’re not standing around doing

nothing,” said Graham. “You have i

i said Geiger.

,3

13 hours . .. everyone can find an
hour to go and vote.”

Along with the presidential
election, first-time voters should
also know they have the option to
vote for local Congressmen.

Considering that many young
voters switched their voting loca-
tion to Pittsburgh, voters can opt
not to vote in these elections if
they feel like they do not know
enough about the candidates, or
they can chose to vote strictly for
their political party.

“If you feel comfortable voting
towards your party, then ﬁne. But
if you really don’t know anything,
just opt not to vote in that race,”

A warning Graham gives to
first—time voters is to be very care-
ful during the process.

“Just read the screens and know
that there’s no time limit once you
get in there, so you can review it
and make sure that’s who you want

to vote for,” said Graham.

“They should have time off if they’re work-

At this stage in the project, Kusuma said it’s
more important for them to raise awareness
about the importance of voting than getting
businesses to allow their employees time off

“We’re trying to show people the impor-

EDITORIAL

. Everyonce in a while, people
 leave a party, but they don’t leave

 their drinks. As they’re walking ‘

 down the street, they’re stopped
E by the police and asked what
they’re drinking, then written up
for an open" container violation.
Only now, Pittsburgh City Coun-
cil wants to make that charge
hurt a bit more. The council has

quadrupled the ﬁne from $50

I to $200 in an effort to dissuade
" people from walking around

with drinks in their hands.
Unfortunately for City Coun-

! cil, though, raising the ﬁne isn’t

going to change anything.

The fact of the matter is that
people don’t think about getting
an open container violation, so
changing the amount of money
that someone is going to have to
pay when he gets one doesn’t ad-
dress the root of the problem.
Nobody would have said that
$50 was an acceptable price for
being able to walk with his beer,
but $200 isn’t an acceptable
price, either.

I No one wants to pay a ﬁne ei-

ther way, so the fact that people

effects. It’s not going to stop
anyone who would have tried it
previously from trying it again
now. .

Part of this is because there’s
a speciﬁc culture of tolerance
inside the main parts of South
Oakland that doesn’t exist in
the rest of the city. House par-
ties routinely spill outside onto
balconies and front steps, and
for the most part they continue
through the night -without con-

Raising open container
ﬁne not a ﬁnal solution

sequence. Even at last year’s
SempleFest, there were only sev-
en open container violations for
a party that shut down an entire
street and involved more than
1,000 people. p

The fact is that without in-
creased police enforcement and
a shift in the way college students
think about open container vio-
lations, there will never be a sig-
niﬁcant reduction in the amount
of violations. And especially as
Pitt grows larger and students
take over more of South Oak-
land’s houses, this culture of tol-
erance will only spread, no mat-
ter what the ﬁne for a violation
is.

The police department and

City Council speciﬁcally direct— 0

ed this increase at Oakland, cit-
ing the disproportionate amount
of offenses in the neighbor-
hood and the neglect for the law
among students. But it’s hard
to have respect for a law that is
only barely enforced.

- The only real punishment
to an open container violation
is that it appears on your per-
manent record, and that hasn’t
changed from before City Coun-

cil raised the ﬁne. Other than
1 that, people are simply going to

disregard the ﬁne just like they
disregarded it before, because
of the way that theseviolations
are tolerated in Oakland.

_ It’s unfortunate that City
Council is .so naive when it
comes to handling problems
like these. But it’s clear that the
raised ﬁne won’t have any ef-
fect on how many people violate
open container laws, until the
ﬁne is accompanied by increased
enforcement and less tolerance.

Gov't shouldn't ﬁnance merger

 
    

by Lewis Lehe
Columml/t

Secretary of the Treasury
Henry Paulson is thinking about
using billions of federal dol-
lars to ﬁnance a merger between
Chrysler and GM. The point is
to save Chrysler and to keep GM
from shrinking. That’s not a good
idea. I

The New York Times is in fa-
vor of  It says there’s a chance
the government’s loan will be
paid back, but it’s not too conﬁ-
dent.They say it’s “not unreason-
able” to expect that the company

will survive. Maybe I’m stingy

for asking tax money to go to-

ward things we’d go so far as to _

call “reasonable.” If I want to bet
on Cinderella stories, my money’s
on -the Penguins, not Chrysler.
The government actually bailed
out Chrysler already, back in the
1980s ' .

Even if -the loan won’t be paid
back, though, the Times believes
that sinking money into keeping

’ the terminal ‘patient of Chrysler

alive is still worthwhile. Jobs could
be lost, not just in Detroit but on
and down the chain at suppliers
nationwide’. A few dozen billion,
even in bad loans, will push the

headache further into the future, .

when we’re better situated to deal
with it, maybe. So goes the rea-
soning.

I can see where the Times is
coming from. After all, in the past
few months, the government has
been attempting Hail Mary plays
to rescue financial institutions.
What’s so different about a car
company?

Actually, a lot. Banks rely on
conﬁdence, which is a psycho-
logical state, not a physical reality
like the tendency of an engine to
break down. '

The moment depositors lose
their conﬁdence in a bank, their
fear is justified. And that conﬁ-
dence depends on the perception
of the banking sector, so one
failure can easily ripple outward
to undermine even soundly run
banks. Cue “The Great Depres-
sion.”

In contrast, the entirety of
other industries rarely falls into
trouble. Ford, Chrysler and GM
are messed up, but Toyota, Hon-
da and Volkswagen are soundly
aﬂoat. .

And even though auto sales
are down across the entire indus-
try —— 26.6 percent, according
to MSNBC — the latter compa-
nies aren’t about to go bankrupt.
They are doing better because

they make better cars using less’

resources. The American con-

sumer’s ability to get a car is not
in danger —-just the ability to get
a car from a particular company,
which shouldn’t bother us. That’s
capitalism. A

The government plays a part
ensuring work for the willing. Re-
cessions have tried remedies. But
we should resuscitate demand in
general — aggregate demand,
not demand for certain products.
To boost buying, the Fed cuts in-
terest‘ rates, but the Fed is almost
targeting zero percent. Now Con-
gress should help out by cutting
taxes, boosting social spending,
replacing broken infrastructure
and helping lower governments

that would’ve cut essential ser-

vices.

These measures help cities and
states buy what they planned to
anyway and let consumers spend
how they want, but they sustain
competition between ﬁrms in the
same industry. If the government
puts money in consumer’s~ pock-
ets, and consumers don’t choose
certain cars, it’s because those
cars are worse. We want ﬁrms that
-make worsecars to close up shop,
so that the resources those ﬁrms
use -—- including workers — can
be bought up by ﬁrms that make
what consumers actually want. ‘

Chrysler go under, the image that.

Students: Bring back the trick-or-treat tradition

by Richard Brown
Artaidtant Opi/zioa Editor

 

Like a large majority of col-
lege students, I spent Friday in
another person’s house, drinking
beverages out of plastic cups and
surrounded by people dressed in
ridiculous costumes. I can safely
say this because I was dressed in
a ridiculous costume myself, and
could thus revel in the glory. A

For all those who are curious,
I went dressed as “The Octagon.”
My one friend was “Dr. Kenneth
Noisewater,” and my other friend
was “James Westfall.” If you get
the joke, you are awesome.

But that’s not my point. My
point is that, throughout the
whole night, I didn’t see any can-
dy. None. I only had one group of
people knock at my door for trick-
or-treat, and I had to turn them
away because I didn’t have any
candy. I felt bad for it, too — the
kids were probably 8 years old and
obviously looking forward to free
Snickers and Twix.

What ever happened to trick-
or-treating? Why does it disappear
as soon as we go away to college?
Fortunately I have a few theories
to answer these otherwise rhetori-
cal questions.

Mostly, I think that people
with children ‘don’t trust college
students. Personally, I know I
wouldn’t send my purely hypo-
thetical kids to get candy in South
Oakland on a Friday night. iGod
only knows what kind of hedo-
nism and satanic rituals go on in
student apartments. They’re all
probably drinking and slipping
each other drugs, those darned
whippersnappers!

Sadly, this belief isn’t entirely
unfounded. College students have
a tendency to get a little inebri-
ated, and on party‘ nights like
Halloween this is only amplified.
Then you get stories about people
roofied at parties, mugged in dark
alleys or shot outside a stranger’s
home — something that recently
happened in South Carolina, when
a man shot a 12-year-old with an
AK-47 after thinking the masked

children were robbing him —- and
it’s a wonder parents let their kids
leave the house at all.

This is a real shame, because
some of my best holiday memo-
ries are from trick—or—treating
on Halloween. When I was in
kindergarten I dressed up as the
joker from "Batman," because the
original Tim Burton ﬁlm had only
come out a few years before, and
I was in love with that movie as a
child. And I can say with no ex-
aggeration that my costume was
awesome, to the point where it
won the best costume contest.

And then I got to go out that
night and get free candy. This
lasted pretty much the whole way
through middle school and into
10th grade, at which point it was
too much of a kid’s thing to do
any more, at least according to all
the people whose doors I knocked
on with my friends. “Aren’t you a
little old for this?” they’d say, as if
you’re ever too old for free choco-
late.

But in college trick-or-treating
isn’t even mentioned. I guess that

the prospect of 355 booze some-
how replaces free candy,' even
though from a purely economic
standpoint that hardly makes
sense: Free is always the way to go,
right? I would suggest a college-
centric beer trick—or—treat where
you go around and collect "beer
from people’s houses at the door,
but I’m pretty sure there are laws
against that sort of thing. Plus
nobody would ever be home, be-
cause the}/d all be walking around
trying to collect free beer.

But even if we somehow man-
age to get everyone to start giv-
ing away candy, the image of the
college campus as a hotbed of
depravity remains. You could give
the treats out to people at your
party, but beer and chocolate is
rarely a winning combination, es-
pecially when it’s a stain you’re try-
ing to get out of your carpet after
somebody doesn’t make it to the
bathroom.

So how to attract parents and
kids back into campus neighbor-
hoods? It would probably be good
to clean up your house and yard,

and maybe leave a porch light on.
Make your place look welcoming
and wholesome. Demonic pump-
kins, trash, broken bottles and
signs that say things like “FREE
CANDY HERE (WE WON’T
KILL/ EAT YOU)” probably
aren’t a good_idea. Think middl

America for this one. '

And if you do happen to get
any kids knocking on your door,
make sure your costume is appro-
priate. Dressing as a sexy ﬁreman
or Victoria’s Secret Angel might be
funny, but it’s not likely that you’ll
be getting any repeat visitors, ex-
cept potentially the police.

It might be too late to save this
Halloween for the trick-or-tIeat-
ers, seeing as it’s already over and
all. But that doesn’t mean that it’s
too early to start planning for next
year. Just think of how awesome
you could make Halloween, not

‘ just for yourself but for all the kids

that would be getting candy out of
it. And if nobody comes to your
house, you can still eat it yourself.

Car industry should follow capitalist principles

Lehe, page 6

millions of workers, like specially
designed machines, who came
out of the uterus ready to make
car parts.

Those workers are phantoms.
Real American workers can turn
time and energy toward what-
ever task employers demand. For
example, just two days after the
editorial outiined above, the New
York Times ran an article about
new jobs in green energy that

said, “In Northwestern Ohio,
glass factories suffering because
of the downturn in the auto in-
dustry are retooling to make solar
energy panels.”

Real American workers can
learn different jobs; they can
even move across the country for
work, and they can even go back
to school.

Adjusting is hard, but that
doesn’t mean we should forgo

progress. And that’s easy for Lew-
is Lehe to say, but that doesn’t
mean I’m wrong.

For the workers who lose,
America should have a safety net.
We already do to a great extent.
But money for bailouts means
less money for social programs.
America has prospered ’ with a
capitalist welfare state. This bail-
out endangers welfare as much as
capitalism.

The biggest danger, though,
is the Treasury becoming an eco-
nomic St. Jude: A Patron Bank of
Lost Causes. What will guide this
bank’s loans is not profitability,
or any predictable and consistent
value. Congress will make loans
based on lobbying and contri-
butions. Voters will support any
cause in fashion, whatever’s mar-
keted to the vague intuitions of
a disinterested crowd. If a com-

mon voter cannot imagine life
without a company, politicians
would rather stretch the budget
than stretch the voter’s irnagina-
tion.

If you can imagine this fu-
ture, I think you’ll agree with
me. Whatever might happen to
Chrysler, intervention is unrea-
sonable.

With an anthemic beginning
boasting huge acoustic skills, Cas-
tanet’s Czy of Refuge redeﬁnes folk
music.

The latest album from the
band, which centers on singer-
songwriter Raymond Raposa, al-
ternates from guitar-strumming
melodies to a spacey “alien inva-
sion” montage. This makes sense,
considering that Castanets has
been a part of a freak-folk move-
ment remaking folk music.

Cay ry” Refuge alternates be-
tween being sweet and dark. The
record is full of comforting and
relaxing guitar-strumming, as
well as dark and forbidding tunes
and static blaring from speak-
ers in a freakish manner that al-
most screams, “The invaders are
here!”

And really, it’s the theme of
the record: good versus evil, and
the never-ending struggle this
brings.

The album was the product
of three weeks that Raposa spent
isolated and alone in a Nevada
desert hotel. This desolation
comes through in the music, too,
with echoing and aching tones
that paint a sparse, almost desper-
ate musical canvas.

Freshmen face off in dorm competition

. by Sarah Simkin
Staﬁ’ Wrder

We attend classes in a suspi-
ciously castle-like building, and
some of us might even live in
towers. But it’s the First-Year
Cup, a competition among fresh-
men resident halls, which most
ﬁrmly cements Pitt’s tie to the
magic academy’s annual Hogwarts
House Cup.

The First Year Cup is a pro-
gram for first-years (a Harry
Potter—esque, politically correct
term for freshmen) that was es-
tablished last year by Residence
Life and Student Life. Students
earn points by attending various
social and educational campus-
wide events, and the winner is the
hall with the most points at the
end of the term.

A cup is given out both fall
semester and spring semester,
which means that there are two

chances for each hall to achieve
glory in the form of a trophy that
is the hall’s to display. Last year
this accolade went to the Quad
and Tower A for fall and spring
term, respectively. There are addi-
tional personal prizes distributed
throughout the year, as well as
that essential element of attract-
ing college students to any event
of any kind: free food.

“The Cup is basically to pro-
mote all the events we have on
campus and help ﬁrst-years get
integrated into the University and
feel pride in their residents’ halls,”
said Dawna Jones who, with jo-
hanna Novacky, is in charge of
the FYC program.

This year, with the introduc-
tion of the Outside the Class-

' room Curriculum program, stu-

dents can earn OCC credit for
attendance at each event as well.
Somewhat perplexingly, however,
all FYC events are OCC events,

but not all OCC events are FYC
events.

Karin Asher, who is the assis-
tant director of Residence Life,
explained, “We try to highlight
programs for the FYC of speciﬁc
interest to first-year students from
different areas in the Outside the
Classroom Curriculum, as well as
social programs.”

Jocelyn Cilik, a staff member
of Student Life, said, “We plan at
least two or three events a month
-— one that we create, one that’s
already established and one that
we co-sponsor with another Uni-
versity organization. It’s sort of
an extended orientation process
for new students because there’s
so much activity in the ﬁrst week
in school, and we want to keep
them involved and connected.”

The eight residence halls with
signiﬁcant freshmen populations

participate, and commuter stu-

dents participate as well, a least in

McLovin somehow gets dkier in ‘Role ods'

“Role Models”

Starring Paul Rudd, Seann William Scott
Directed by David Wain

What occasion
is so special that it
unites “American
Pie’s” Stiﬂer, “Clue—
1ess’s” josh, “Su-
perbad’s” McLovin, “Reno 9l1’s”
Trudy and “V/’s” Laura Bush? A
championship duel at a medieval
fantasy battle, of course.

V This battle sets the concluding
scene of “Role Models,” a new
comedy directed by David Wain,
who is a former correspondent
on “The Daily Show.”

“Role Models” is a coming—of-
age tale for both the ﬂick’s chil-
dren and adults. It follows friends
Danny (Paul Rudd) and Wheeler

 

(Seann William Scott) as they
combat work, relationships, kids,
an ex—junkie and each other.

Danny and Wheeler, who is the
spokesman and minotaur mascot
for a Shrek—pee—inducing energy
drink, begin their journey by
choosing mentorship over prison
after getting arrested for crash-
ing their work truck (pimped out
as a bull, complete with a silver-
hooped nose  i

Danny’s usual negativity is at
an extreme level during this day
from hell when he loses both his
girlfriend and his job. His cyni-
cism is so extreme that it even
rubs off on his usually easy—go-
ing, carefree counterpart, Wheel-

sequences.

Instead of 30 days in jail,
they opt to act as “Bigs” in a Big

Do you hear
that creepy, rasp_—~~
mg, ominous
breathing behind
you?

Don’t worry — it’s not a psy-
chokiller, it’s merely the sound
of a successful horror movie se-
ries struggling to catch some air
while it is dying a long, drawn—out
death.’ .

The series in desperate need
of resuscitation is the infamous
“Saw,” and the ﬁfth and latest in-
stallment does nothing but push
this forsaken and unfortunately
open—ended string of torture-
fests further under the waves of
obscurity.

You saw this “Saw” ﬁve years

 

‘ago, when it was the inventive

little indie that brought a new
wave of sadism to the American
cinema. _

Then you saw it again a year
later  the second installment,
which added group dynamics to
create what would probably be
theibestin the series. After that,
the “Saws” began to teeter.

And now, for the third yearin
a 1‘O\V, the series has lost sight of
what originally made it stupid B-
movie fun. i

Sure, there are still the death
traps and plenty of gore to" go
around, but gone are the super-
ﬁcially thrilling, hyper—edited se-
quences, the severed—tongue-in-
cheek humor and any shred of
campiness.

What was once the stand—out
among crappy horror ﬁlms has
been neutered by convoluted plot
twists and groan—wor_thy “surprise
endings” that do nothing but so-
lidify next October’s installment.
It’s enough to make you wish for
the next version of “[Insert Japa-
nese Horror .”

The plot is so wrapped up

On first listen to The Stiletto
Formal’s /Fias7a.§'Fiarz‘a./,'Fie:tcL/,'Fzas2‘a./,
it sounds like the band, is  to
jump in on the  overcrowded
trend of gla.m—punk bands. Listen-
ing  it’s the unconventional ad-
ditions to each song, like violins or a
guest spot from indie rapper Murs,
that set the band apart

Perhaps it’s because the sound is
reminiscent of ’90s grunge rock that
it comes off less manufactured than-
many popular punk bands. Tossed
into the mix are subtle inﬂuences of
jazz and blues, as it‘seems the band
is fond of combining very different
elements

The CD’s title track, “;Fiestal;Fi
estaliFiesta!;Fiesta!,” shows off The
Stiletto Formal’s talent for lyrics, par-
ticularly in the opening. Lines like,
“Heaven has malignant resonance
/ \V1th a digital conviction / She
sends 'more than I can stomach,”
come off like dark poetry. At some
of the fastest and loudest points of
the song, the soothing sounds of

string instruments quietly juxtapose

intense  riffs and falsetto sing-‘
ing. A

When “Sleeping Our Way to the
Top’; begins, it doesn’t even sound
like the same album. The voice of
underground rapper Murs begins
the song chronicling the plight of a
young wannabe musician selling out
Pairing with the lead singefs falsetto,

Stiletto F ormal's latest

Murs’ rumbling is an  al-

beit delightful combination.

“Desperada” begins with an
organ and a melancholy 
Gloomy tones  out much
more emotion in the lead singers
voice than previously in the album.
Once  wavering strings make
their appearance It’s by far the most
poignant song of the album but

ends on a loud note with a section

of -prominent dr_ums and handclap—

The Stiletto Formal seems-un-
afraid to explore and fuse different

a little something different thrown

worth listening to.

foul language, but it spews out
in greatest excess from Ronnie.

And, given his tender age, it is
unexpectedly entertaining while
sometimes unnerving. ’

But the mixed reaction to Ron-
nie’s attitude and.language adds
an edge to the film. Thompson’s
performance also matches, the
performances of other support-
ing cast standouts, most notably
Lynch and Mintz-Plasse.

As eccentric tough gal Gayle,
Lynch gives a solid and humorous
performance to match her come-
dic appearances in everything
from roles in Christopher Guest
ﬁlms to guest-starring spots on
primetime sitcoms.

The most endearing perfor-
mance comes from Mintz-Plasse,_

who, following his breakout role
in last year’s “Superbad,” nails it ,

as Augie, a nerd even geekier than
McLovin. i

who live off campus] to evening programs,

but we’re hoping to see more in the future,” 4

saidjones.
The ranking system is based on per-

centages rather than on the actual number -

of attendees as a way to prevent the more
populated halls from having an unfair ad-
vantage.

Currently, Forbes Hall is in the lead with
21 percent of the total ﬁrst—year participa-
tion, Tower A is in second with 17 percent,
and Tower B is close behind with 16 per-

cent. Holland is in fourth with 14'percent, ~

Tower C and Sutherland are tied with 11
percent each, Lothrop has 9 percent, and
the Quad has 8 percent.

FYC events are promoted on Facebook
and with ﬂiers posted around campus.

“The FYC logo seems to be a stamp that
students recognize now,” says Cilik.

Asher attributes the success to kicking
off the FYC during new student orienta-
tion, which exposed students to the pro-
gram earlier.

“There’s been a huge increase in atten-
dance this year compared to last year,” said
Asher. “They saw the quality and were ex-

cited.” '
Tailgates before the football games have
beenlsome of the best attended events, at
least partially because of the popularity
of student season tickets this year. Other
events have included the PPC Bonﬁre and
Pep Rally, the volunteer fair, the interna-
tional fair and Pitt Make A Difference Day.
The ﬁnal events of the season will be
the Bowling and Bingo Extravaganza that
will be held at the Pittsburgh Athletic As-
sociation on Nov. 21 and "Stay up with the
Cup," a program co-sponsored by the'Aca-

demic Resource Center and Pitt Program‘

Council that is geared toward ﬁnals prep.

“All the major rooms in the student
union will be open for quiet study and
group tutoring. There will also be snacks
and stress relief activities,” says Asher of
the Stay up with the Cup event.

The winner for fall semester will be an-
nounced in January at the kickoff event of
the spring semester FYC programs, which is
rumored to be a breakfast karaoke event at
Nordy’s. Programs in the works for spring
semester include a Pitt Arts co-sponsored
event, a program for Black History Month
and a sexual health program around Valen-
tine’s Day.

ﬂows straight ‘into the next. The majority
of songs do not have lyrics, and those that
do are all the more powerful. _

“Fly Away,” for example, proclaims:
“I’ll ﬂy away, ﬂy away / In the morning /
When I die Hallelujah / by and by! I’ll ﬂy
away, ﬂy away.”

“Fly Away” is an incredibly short good-
bye song. It’s as if Raposa hit his limit
and decided, “I’m done, and it’s time to
take off on this gorgeous morning to ﬁnd
somewhere even more glorious.” It goes
well with an earlier song titled “Refuge 1,”
where Raposa’s intent is to run away to a
city of refuge. _ _

Then it’s time to enter an even darker
zone, when songs like “Shadow Valley”

‘strike the stereo and begin to preach about

a darker side of mankind.

“I swear your breath last night / Sound-
ed just like thunder / I swear your breath
last night sounded just like gunshots,” sings

Raposa.

Supporting cast pushes 'Role

Models" to new comedic level

ies. Leading man Rudd, as always, delivers
a great performance. But the weight of the

.cast’s performances isn’t heavy enough to

land “Role Models”'a top spot on the scale
of recent comedies. _

W/ith so many outrageous,‘ laugh-out-
loud comedies out lately — think the Ap-
atow-led ﬂicks like “The 40 Year Old Vir-
gin,” “Knocked Up” and “Forgetting .Sarah
Marshall,” — “Models” falls short.

‘ Because of the high quality of these
preceding ﬁlms, audiences will likely enter
“Role Models” with heightened expecta-
tions. Unfortunately, the ﬁlm doesn’t quite

_ hit the mark.
Certain parts of the ﬁlm do deliver solid _

laughs, though. The LAIRE scenes, fueled
by ridiculous costumes and Shakespearian
language, provide a unique and amusing
layer to the movie. '

The medieval ﬁghting scenes — set in

a forest —— not only enhance the storyline
of the ﬁlm, but also add color to the bleak
surrounding of trees and rocks with multi-
hued attire and decorative team crests.
Concluding the ﬁlm in these colorful
woods shows that Danny and Wheeler’s
journey has brought them out of their dark
and pessimistic funk by catapulting them
into a more vibrant and open place in their

_ lives.

As the 150ih0urs of community service
slowly dwindle, ending at the LAIRE com-
petition, the Bigs lend support and conﬁ-
dence to their Littles. It’s the kids, though,
who help the adults mature and ﬁnd them-
selves in the end.

“Role Models,” although never lacking.

lewd material, sends a message of encour-
agement. In the words of Danny to a "sul-
len Augie, “You gotta do what you love and
be yourself.”

Blood, gore and bore

make 'SaW V’ ahllst  

Saw V, page 9
in the series’ contrived mythology that it
would take an unfathomably long time to
explain it all to the uninitiated, so basically,
this installment picks off where theilast left
off.

That is, we have a new Jigsaw substitute
(Costas Mandylor) who realizes an FBI

colleague (Scott Patterson) is onto his dirty,

game. A tired cat-and-mouse plot ensues,

V and at no point is it remotely interesting.

Then there is the group of people who
wake up in a signature Jigsaw deatl1-trap
and are told they must work together to
survive. i

i No one is particularly recognizable, rni-
nus Julie Benz ,of Sh'owtime’s “Dexter.”
The ﬁlm alternates between the cop stuff
and this gauntlet of traps, and it is imme-
diately clear that the group scenes are far
more interesting than the cops. if _

i Unfortunately, the movie only spends
about a third of its time on the group, and
the cop scenes are split between the pres-
ent and seven-too-many ﬂashbacks from
the ﬁrst four ﬁlms that intend to make the
audience gasp with intriguing insight, but

result only in groan after groan of been- '

there, done-that. _
One of the few positive things the mov-

ie has to offer is the se1f—awareness exhib-
ited in the group scenes, especially when

the characters ﬁrst realize they’re in one of '

]igsaw’s traps. They ﬁgure out every trap
fairly quickly and seem like they have al-
ready gone through Deathtrap Bootcamp
before arriving in the real thing.

Or they just watched “Saw I—IV” too
many times. i ' .

They apparently missed a lesson or
two, though — they wind up duped be-
cause they.didn’t really listen to the clues.

A Homer Simpson-esque “d’oh!” would be

maddeninglyiappropriate here.

Many will see this movie just to see what"
grisly new traps the writers have cooked _

up. Depending on the individual death-
trap appreciation quotient, many will ﬁnd
the traps lazy and uninspired, but brutal
enough to satisfy whatever thirst it is that

keeps the torture—porn horror sub-genre ’

alive. 

Except for" an interesting-setup where
characters must saw their arms in half to
ﬁll a beaker full of blood, the most inter-
esting trap in the entire ﬁlm is the movie
theater itself. A

The ﬁlmrnaker’s are the real Jigsaw here,

_ so be wary and you might survive.

South Bend Slam: Pitt takes down Irish

by Zack Chakan
Auatltta/zt Sparta Editor

SOUTH BEND, Ind. —In a game

i that included deﬂected receptions,

a blocked punt, an  before the

. huddle broke and even an unexpect-

ed appearance by the ﬁeld sprinklers,
the Pitt football team relied on two
of its most dependable players on
Saturday against Notre Dame.

LeSean McCoy and Conor Lee
came through when it counted.

McCoy carried the ball 32 times
for 169 yards and a touchdown,
while Lee kicked a school-record ﬁve
ﬁeld goals, including four in overtime
periods, to inch the Panthers past the
 Irish, 36-33, in four over-
times at Notre Dame Stadium.

Pitt (6-2) overcame a 17-3 half-

. time deﬁcit and matched Notre

Dame ﬁeld goal for ﬁeld goal in the
overtimes until  Irish kicker
Brandon \X/alker ﬂinched.

Walker connected on a 48-yard
ﬁeld goal to bring the score to 33-33
in the third overtime, but he missed

wide left on a 38-yarder onthe next
drive to give Pitt a shot at the victory

Two plays later, McCoy broke out-
side for an 18-yard  then rushed
once right to set up Lee’s game—win-
ner from only 22 yards away.

“I didn’t really know what to do,”
said Lee about the game-winning
kick. “It was awesome. It was so
good for our team to get this kind
of win.”

The contest lasted for more than
four hours and was the longest in ei-
ther team’s history.

“I really can’t describe the heart
that our football team has,” said Pitt
coach Dave Wannstedt “They never
really came unglued with as many

adverse things that happened in this
game Nobody ever folded.”
Sophomore quarterback Pat

Bostick,  in for the injured
Bill Stull, tossed three interceptions,
but his 10-yard touchdown pass to
Jonathan Baldwin on fourth down
with 2:22  in the game tied
the score at 24 and sent the game to
overtime.

SOUTH BEND, Ind. — Some-

importance of a good kicker. But
anyone watching Pitt’s 36-33 win
over Notre Dame on Saturday
should have a much, much better
idea.

Conor Lee’s 22-yard ﬁeld goal
in the fourth overtime ended the
longest game in either school’s his-

comeback that catapulted Pitt into

Men's soccer blown out, still

earns bid to Big East tourney

by Ben Duignan
Staﬁ’ Writer

Pitt men’s soccer played its
last regular season game against
Providence on Saturday. But for
the first time since 2006, the Pan-
thers earned a bid into the Big

East tournament — extending
their season by at least another
day.

The Panthers lost, 3-0, to
Providence. But with a Seton Hall
loss to Connecticut, the team was
able to slip into the tournament,
awaiting what looks to be a first
round matchup against Louis-
ville.

In a game that looked com-
pletely one—sided from the score,
Pitt coach Joe Luxbacher said
he still thought his squad should
have won.

“We should have been ahead
in this game,” he said. ‘We

missed on a [great opportunity]
when one hit the crossbar. It was
a funny game today because we
played hard and played well, [but]
gave up three goals.”

While Providence controlled
the ﬁrst half of play, out-shooting
Pitt 8-3, the Panthers bounced
back. The game ended even as far
as shots went, 12-12.

But even with the Pitt resur-
gence, the Panthers weren’t able
to stop the Friars from making a
couple of huge plays.

The game remained score-
less until the 76th minute when
Providence forward Alex Red-
ding put the ball in the goal from
five yards out.

It took just 16 more seconds
for ProVidence’s Andrew Sousa
to score on a header, putting the
game out of reach for Pitt.

Then, in the 88th minute,
Providence put a ﬁnal exclama-

Timothy Ritter’s shot deﬂected

The loss moved Pitt’s record
to 7-7-3 overall and 3-6-2 in the
Big East. The Friars improved
their record to 8-6-3 and 5-5-1 in
Big East play.

Even though the loss is dis-
appointing, Pitt earned a bid
into the postseason. Luxbacher
stressed the team’s need to focus
and stay tough.

“The team is disappointed
[about the loss to Providence],
and they should be,” said Lux-
bacher. “But this team should be
conﬁdent.

“Every game is a new game.
We played poorly this year, and
we rebounded from those games.
I think we can do it again.”

The team will play its first

Pitt volleyball handles
Rutgers on the road 

by Jay Huerbin
Staff Writer

' The Pitt volleyball team de-
feated Rutgers in four sets on
the road on Saturday, ending a
two-game skid and improving its
record to 7-3 in the Big East. Pitt
also extended its perfect 4-0 re-
cord on the road this season.

Senior Kelly Campbell re-
corded a double-double as she
led the Panthers with 14 kills and
10 digs. Sophomore Amy Town
and freshman Allyson Hodnick
also contributed with nine kills
and 33 assists, respectively. De-
fensively, senior Stephanie Ross
blocked seven shots and had 10
digs. The Panthers out—blocked
the Scarlet Knights, 13.5-7.

Trailing 21-19 in the first set,
Pitt stormed back with a 6-0 run
to seal the win and set the tone
for the rest of the match. The
momentum from the first set’s

come-from-behind win contin-
ued, and Pitt defeated the Scarlet
Knights in the second set. 49
After the two teams came out
for the third set, Rutgers showed
it wouldn’t let Pitt leave jersey
without a light, jumping to a
7-1 lead. The Panthers made it a
close set, but after giving up a 4-0
run, they fell behind again, even-
tually losing the game. M
But the Panthers jumped out
to an early lead in the fourth set
and never looked back. Using
the energy seen in the first 
sets, the team posted a .306 hit-
ting percentage while holding the
Scarlet Knights to only 16 points.
With their 15th overall win, the
Panthers matched their win total

from all of last season.

Pitt faces Louisville (7-3 Big
East, 11-10 overall) on Friday.
The two teams are tied for sec-
ond in the Big East.

he would. Ten Panthers played more than
13 minutes. Tyrell Biggs, Brad Wanamaker,
Woodall and Brown all played 20 or more.

“We’re a relatively young group, and
we’ve got to ﬁnd out what our lineup is go-
ing to be,” said Dixon.

Sam Young led all scorers with 16, at-
tempting six three-pointers but only hitting
tWO.

Dixon said he expects Young to play
the perimeter more this year but doesn’t
want him to become strictly a three-point
shooter.

Dejuan Blair scored 12 and had seven
rebounds, four of which were offensive.
McGee added 10 rebounds and scored 11
points, while Biggs scored 13 to go with his
eight rebounds.

Although Pitt held a 46-28 halftime
lead, it still played sloppily early on. The
Panthers shot 15 percent on three-point at-

tempts and 50 percent from the free throw
line in the opening half. They also had six
turnovers and only nine assists.

“We didn’t have enough [assists] in the
ﬁrst half,” said Dixon, adding he didn’t
think the team moved the ball well early.

Pitt blew the game open in the open— ;
ing minutes of the second half as it went T
on a 30-3 run, giving it a 76-31 advantage. 
In the second half, Pitt shot 58 percent on
three—point attempts and 88 percent on
free throws.

The Panthers play their next preseason ;

‘game on Sunday against LaRoche at home

at 1 p.m.

Dixon said the Panthers have only had
13 practices thus far, so the opportunity
to play in a game situation was more than '
welcome.

“The timing was good,” he said. “We ,

needed to la someone else.”

Clausen gets hot early but

shut down in second half

Football, page 15

Notre Dame quarterback Jimmy Clausen
threw for 271 yards and three touchdowns,
and freshman receiver Michael Floyd caught
10 passes for 100 yards and two scores for the
 Irish (5-3).

Pitt’s victory came one week after Stull’s
concussion and neck  during the Panthers’
54-34 defeat to Rutgers, and the game gives the
Panthers bowl—eligibility for the second time in
four years under Warmstedt

“Legends are made in games like this,” said
Wannstedt “The great  about this win [is
that] the entire team will be recognized and re-
membered for this for the next 25 years”

Bostick was 14-of-27 passing for 164 yards,
a touchdown and three interceptions, and he
was replaced for two drives early in the game
by redshirt sophomore Kevan Smith, who saw
his ﬁrst action of the season. But Bostick drove
Pitt down the ﬁeld continuously in the second
half to give it a chance, with McCoy leading the
attack.

McCoys 169 yards gives him 1,004 for the
season,  him the third  back in
Pitt’s history to run for over 1,000 yards in two
seasons for his career. He joined Tony Dorsett
and Curvin Richards.

The teams were tied, 3-3, until Notre Dame
scored two touchdowns in the last 1:27 of the
second quarter. Floyd caught both scores from
Clausen, the second coming with only four sec-

— onds remaining in the half That drive material-

ized after one of Bostick’s interceptions, making
the score 17-3.

Pitt drove right down the ﬁeld to start the
second half and ﬁnished the drive with a 4—yard
plunge by LaRod Stephens—Howling

Pitt’s defense held strong in the third quarter,
 Notre Dame to only seven net yards on
10 plays and without a score

McCoy tied the score at 17 early ir1 the :

fourth quarter with a one-yard dive after a 15-
play, 70-yard drive that lasted for more than
eight minutes.

But Clausen ﬁnally found some time and 
receivers on Notre Dame’s next drive, leading 
the team on a 12-play scoring diive. He found 1

Golden Tate, who had 111 receiving yards on A
the day, for a six-yard score with only 5:38 re-
maining in the game.

Baldwin’s catch tied the score on the next
drive after the Pitt coaches called the same play
three times in a row Bostick misﬁred on the ﬁrst
two but found Baldwin on the fourth-down at-
tempt.

“[It seemed like it took] about 10 times,” said 
Wannstedt, regarding the three-play sequence. 

“It was about the extent of our  game.”

Each squad had opportunities to win the ‘

game with a touchdown in overtime, but the
defenses emerged, forcing only ﬁeld goals. L

' Early in the ﬁrst overtime, a set of sprinklers _g

went off on one side of the ﬁeld, delaying play 
for a few minutes. 5.

coach Dave Wannstedt announced
that sophomore quarterback Pat
Bostick would replace Bill Stull,
who suffered a concussion last
week in a loss to Rutgers. The an-

a chance to make history.

- He began overtime by trading
three ﬁeld goals with the I1:ish’s
Brandon Walker. But Walker, who

is few minutes before to tie the game,
missed a 38-yarder wide left, 

. :71»

  

 Pitt a shot at the win.

That feeling was right But af- °
 ter Pitt tailback LeSean McCoy
 basically tossed the offense on his

his career and sending Pitt out of
South Bend with one of its biggest
wins in recent memory. ,

“The entire team will be recog-
nized and remembered for this for
the next 25 years,” said Wannstedt
after the game. “All the legends are
made in games like this.”

It was the kind of game Pitt
would have lost a year ago. And it’s
a game that easilycould have gone
either way.

After Pitt’s ﬁrst offensive posses-
sion — in which Bostick attempted
only one pass —— the coaching staff
called upon third-string quarterback
Kevan Smith. A

An incompletion, a short run
and a sack later, Smith jogged off
the ﬁeld.

\W1thout Stull, the Pitt offense

was 3. H1688.

Still, Lee hit the ﬁrst of his ﬁve H

ﬁeld goals. And after a defensive

out-of-bounds. It was that bad.
The Panthers ended the quar-
ter with six total yards and 4:35 of
possession. Bostick reentered, and
it didn’t get much better the rest
of - the half Pitt entered halftime
trailing, 17-.3. It had only ﬁve ﬁrst
downs and 71 total yards, while the

, Irish had 12 ﬁrst downs and 240 of-

fensive yards. Bostick was throwing
balls highand  targets. He

even tripped and fell immediately

after one snap.

At the same time, Aaron Berry
and the rest of Pitt’s secondary
were struggling in coverage against
the I1:ish’s young receivers, Golden
Tate and Michael Floyd, while
Notre Dame quarterback Jimmy
Clausen looked sharp. Pitt looked
helpless.

But somehow, a different Pitt
team emerged from the locker
room after halftime.

 

fourth-and—1, Bostick hit receiver
Oderick Turner on a short route
that Turner took 37 yards. Tailback
LaRod Stephens-Howling scored
on the next play.

Then the defense did its job,
holding the Irish to just 4:09 of
possession and seven total yards in
the third quarter. . I

McCoy took over from there.
He lined up in nearly every for-
mation imaginable. He lined up at
quarterback, tailback and receiver.
He made runs that made him look
like he was playing high schoolers

and never once appeared winded. '

He scored with- just over eight
minutes remaining in the game to
help_ knot the score at 17.

, Pitt defensive tackle Mick Wil-
liams said that entering the fourth
quarter, he and his teammates had
more conﬁdence than ever.

“It’s a credit to our coaches, our

 Stull still out, Pitt offense struggles through the air

this game into the fourth quarter
we could win it,” said Warmstedt
But it took more than just the
fourth. ' i

X .

After a Notre Dame touchdown, ._ ~,,

Bostick threw his only touchdown

pass of the game to Jonathan Bald-

win, sending the game to overtime.

That just meant more of McCoy
and even more of Lee, who said he
remembers watching in 2004 when
ex—Pitt kicker Josh Cummings hit a
game-winner in South Bend.

“It’s a dream come true,” he said.
"I just always wanted to do that.”

He added that no matter what

the situation is, he stays calm and-'

takes it one kick at a time.

That’s what he did on Saturday.
And in the end, it was Lee who
helped Pitt (6-2)_ take down Notre
Dame in the palace of college foot-
ball. In the situation with the most
pressure, the team depended on
