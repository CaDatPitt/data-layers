-APOLOGY

Following Monday night’s
special meeting of the SG
Senate, a session characterized
by vehement debate over the
proposed SG Resolution to
condemn Sen. Robert Flem-
ing’s proposal, SG President
Scott Baum issued the follow-
ing statement: “I don't want
any of the statements that I
made or that anyone else
made during the meeting this
evening to be construed as di-
rected at anyone personally.
This was simply to register
disagreement with the method
some senators were using to
oppose this resolution against
Sen. Fleming’s proposal. If
any senators were affronted,
"I apologize. After all, denud-
ed of our political views we
are still people — no?”

Against Fleming ‘Riot Act’  

In a special session of the
SG Senate called by President
Scott Baum Monday even-
ing, a .resolution opposing Sen.
Robert Fleming’s proposal
was passed by a vote of 18-4-
2. ‘

Senators opposed to the re-
xsolution argued that, contrary
to" popular opinion, Senator
Fleming’s proposal was con-
stitutional according to- legal
sources they had consulted.
They further contended that the
Fleming proposal was needed
in order to insure that the rights
of students not participating in
demonstrations and or protests

would not be infringed uf>on..

In concluding their argument,
these senators claimed that
Sen. Fleming’s bill would ap-
ply only to instances of violent
student disorders and not to non-
violent, orderly gatherings.

Senators favoring the SG
‘Resolution pointed out that all
bills are constitutional until
tested in the courtroom. It

was further argued that the
Fleming bill rescinds -the Chan.-
cellor’s autonomy in ‘regard to
his vested power to punish viola-
tors of University regulations at
his own discretion. In conclud-
ing, the supporters of the SG. res-
olution stated that they believed
the terms of Sen. Fleming’s pro-
posal to be vague and indefinite.

The following resolution was
sponsored by Senators Bruce
Levenson, Virginia Joyce, Suz-
ann Slyman, Jamie McCreary,
Harris Miller, Rick Beran, Judy

  Quality Not Considered

by VIRGINIA JOYCE
_ Staff N gws Writer

Two language instructors told
the Pitt News Monday that while
they support the student move-
ment pushing for the abolition of
the language requirement, they
feel that an importantaspect. of
the problem is being disregarded.

Dayle Barnes, instructor in
Chinese, and Michio Hojo, Jap-
anese instructor, believe that the
issue of the quality of the lang-
uage courses at the University is
not being considered. They are
afraid that “all the momentum
gathered for the abolition of the
requirement will dissipate with
no improvement in the programs
that'will be left behind.”

“Right now,” posed Barnes, “a
group of courses are masquerad-
ing as a language program. This
has been challenged and justi-
fiably so, by the students. But
the masquerade has not yet been
unmasked; no one has yet raised
relevant questions as to improving
the language program’s quality.’’

The two linguists offered
three main criticisms of the struc-
ture of the language programs at
the.University. C ..

“First off, 'it’s only logical
that language teachers ought to
teach -languages; now by and
large, graduate students in relat-
ed departments are doing the
teaching. It’s absolutely neces-
sary that a background of im-
plied linguistic training be had
by language instructors,” stated
Barnes.

“No full professors are teach-
ing or supervising directly in
any of the language courses,”
added Hojo.

A second point brought up
was that none of the basic lan-
guage courses count as credit to-
ward either a major in languages
or toward satisfaction of the dis-
tribution requirement. This is
operating to discourage stu-
dent interest in foreign lan-
guages,” said the two inter-
viewees.

In the third place. the empha-
sis on literature which makes
up a major part of the second

year of basic language courses”_

has no place in the teaching
structure of the basic language
study?’ according to the two in-
structors. ’

 

. Evast-Asian Languages.

sented in a more neutral light.
It should be a study of the un-
derlying structures, not in
specific cases of specific writers,”
stressed Hojo.

“Of course,” added Barnes,
“Language is not words but
the patterns in which words oc-
cur; not written language, but
spoken language.” Trying to
chuck literature down students
throats is disregarding the whole
essence of what language really
is.”

A few other points that are
bothering the instructors also
.came out in the interview, such
as the inadequacy of the amount
of time that is allotted for learn-
ing the “basic new- habits that
form the crux of language learn-
ing,” and_ a misdirected confi-
dence in native speakers who
lack the essential background in
linguistics training. -

"‘The big problem is that there
is a lack of sincerity, from the
professional point of view. which
makes for a diluted, mediocre lan-
guage program to be aware of this
major lack in their education,”
echoed the two instructors of

all.

Whereas: The bill introduced by
Senator Fleming infringes up-
on the rights of free speech,
public assembly, and self-de-
termination guaranteed by the
Constitution of the United
States; and;

Whereas: This bill negates the
concept of a free University
and is the first step towards
the suppression of the univer-
sity community, -and;

Whereas: There have been no
violent demonstrations here at

tion.

Therefore, Be It Resolved_That:'

tion, and;

Be It Further Resolved That: - A
The Student Government Sen-  -

Senate Absurdity

.__ ’ . Going to a Student Government

(SG) Senate meeting, it has been said,
is like swimming in a giant sea of in-
significance. Words are spoken at
these legislative gatherings, but the
meanings of these sounds are shroud-

I 5 ed in puerile personality attacks.

Such’ was the case at Monday’s
special SG. Senate meeting that dis-

 V-cussed the Fleming situation. For-
I , tunately, the bill was passed by a clear
" majority of the Senate. But the most

' disturbing aspect of the Monday night

comedy was the lack of maturity in-

S - volved with the meeting’s delibera-
jtion.

_ The deliberation on the Fleming
resolution was plagued by a 50 min-
ute discourse on parliamentary pro-
cedure. A number of Senators at the
meeting voiced their dismay with the

‘procedure used to act on the resolu-

tion._ Their action was not in the name
of fair discourse, but in fear that the
resolution’ might pass. The petty in-
fightingin the SG Senate extended the

° meeting for a long period of time.

The most unfortunate aspect of
the parliamentary haggling was that
lines of personal demarcation were
drawn. Each parliamentary tactic

 had the air of personal antagonism.
‘All of this “impish immaturity” is

detrimental to the SG legislative proc-

5‘ ; ess. And personal antagonism rather

than concerned dissent impedes the

_ " -‘potential of SG. Unfortunately, all of

this will doubtlessly continue in the

‘ future. I

 

The inanity of the SG Senate has
been discussed before by this news-

. paper. But in light of recent conduct in

the Senate, we feel the issues should
be raised again.

The Senate, in our view, should
be abolished. Its only function is to al-
low so called representatives of the
student body toexist in a chamber of
mesmerization. Its influence is nom-
inal. What does a resolution of the
Student Government Senate mean?

SG at this University should ideal-
ly be a dynamic force. The Senate frus-

trates this goal. We therefore reiter-

ate a proposal for a new structure
for SG.

SG at the University should be
structured on the union principle.
That is, it should have an executive
board with a certain number of stand-
ing committees. The progress of SG,
in the past year, can only be viewed
in.terms of executive action_and com-
mittee results. This very empirical
evidence convinces us that this sys-
tem is ideal for SG on this campus.

Those Senators who would lodge
complaint against such an improve-
ment, in our view, ‘have no interest
in the progress of SG. They would
rather protect their empty title: Stu-
dent Government Senator. The stakes
in this transition are significant. Stu-
dent Government can become a truly
dynamic force in this academic com-
-munity, or it can continue to exist, in
its present state of absurdity.

By HARRIS MILLER
Staff News Writer

A political party in the minds of to-
day’s college youth means Chicago_, and
deals with Thurmond, Nixon, and Hum-
phrey. As a member of the College Young
Democrats my hopes were perhaps
stronger than other individuals that I as-
sociate with that the parties are not so
bad and if they are
there is a future of

hopes receive at strong
setback in simply one ,
brief weekend is hard "
to take, but that is what ,
happened to me and ’
perhaps it is relevant
to you.

The College Young
Democrats of Pennsylvania is purported
to be an autonomous group striving for bet-
ter leadership in the Democratic party of
the future. As autonomous as this group
claims to be, it certainly is not autonomous
in its methods of action.

THE CYD CONVENTION two weeks
past in Harrisburg was to elect officers.
Idealistic dreams and hopes ran rampant
through those students who appeared to
see where these “new” Democrats were
headed. The same people that are leading
the cry for student involvement on their
campuses were in‘ Harrisburg to lead the
cry for-student involvement in politics.

The idealistic dreams did not last one
night. Bribes, slander, prior commitments
were the order of the day — not idealism
and talks of the future.

People who are still undergraduates
at universities throughout the state were
so caught up in their political rhetoric that
they no longer sounded like today’s youth.
Dreams were lost in harsh, disgusting
realities.

THE POLITICIANS carried the day.
There was a brief cry of discontent from
a few of those dreamers, but the task was

 

R Work Through Politics. . 

 

impossible for such a small few. This is
what is relevant to this academic commu-
nity. In this society as we presently exist
we are just so-many figures of the future,
not people of the present. Within the hal-
lowed walls of the University we may
serve an important function, but in the
whole of the «community we are lost be-
cause we have little relevance to the world
outside of the walls’.

When Senator Robert Fleming be-
comes a threat to us, politics become.
relevant.

When there is a city institution tax,
politics become relevant.

The problem is that when we consid-
er every day of our future we must realize
that every day of our present young lives
is relevant to that harsh, cruel distaste-
ful area called politics. That is where de-
cisions are made for today and for tomor-
row. WE must begin to effect change in
athis realm of politics or we will remain
irrelevant.

Let us begin to expand our horizons
to include that which is around us. This
present cry is to expand to politics. What
we do at the University may be of -little im-
portance next year, but if we can make a
substantial movement to the type of poli-
tics that we, as idealistic youth, envision,
we will be part of a movement that will
be part of our lives.

LET THOSE FEW who cried discon- '

tent grow. We must get involved in poli-
tics from whence we are ruled. As dis-
tasteful as it may be to some, joining legit-
imate organizations with strong influence
be it Young Democrats, Young Republi-
cans, Reform Democrats, or simply a can-
didate that you support is the way politics
will change.

I hope there will never be another con-
vention like the one I witnessed in Harris-
burg. But more importantly, I pray there
will never be another convention like that
of Chicago. It can be prevented. Let us
work to do so.

‘ Dean Paul J. Walter of the University of Pittsburgh at Johns-
town made the following quote when debating the University's
policy of bringing educationally disadvantaged Black students
to the campus to do college work: “ln my opinion, if you send a

 

German Instructor .Speaks—Out On ‘Requirement’

Editor. The Pitt News:

With regards to the controversy con-
cerning the language requirement I would
like to clarify a few points. German 3 is a
course aimed at familiarizing the student
with German language, culture and liter-
ature. The text used in the early weeks of
.the term contains ma ny ‘weaknesses,
which most teachers attempted to side-
step or at least assuage. At no time, how-
ever, were students required to memor-
ize “300” words and “regurgitate” them
on a test. Those students attending class-
es regularly were well aware of this.

In the test, to which reference was
made in a recent letter to The Pitt News,
students simply. answered the questions
with their own vocabulary acquired to a
great extent in either German 1 and 2,
10 or in high school and scored fine re-
sults.

_ May I state categorically that I con-
sider the study of a foreign language, its

V culture and literature an important part

of a liberal education.

By culture I mean exposure to those '

habits, customs and achievements, such
as art and music, which constitute a peo-
ple and its nation.

We Americans have too often fallen

_ prey to the temptation to sit back and let
', foreigners study our language, while we

— have made no efforts in the opposite direc-
tion. Rather, we have concentrated on in-
creasing our technical capacity while ne-
glecting the less immediately practical.
This is deplorable and can only lead to a
typeof cultural isolation.

A country which, despite the cliche,
is a vast melting pot for foreign national--
ities should certainly be at the vanguard

 if .of those forces attempting to analyze and

understand these nationalities and their

cultures. Perhaps our foreignipolicy would
be in an infinitely, better state, perhaps

_ our leaders at all levels would be more so-

phisticated and compassionate if they had
studied foreign languages and cultures
in college or elsewhere.

We all remember that President Ken-
nedy was most ecstatically received in
Berlin at the moment he uttered the words
in German, “Ich "bin ein Berliner,” and
that Mrs. Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis is
held in high esteem in France because of
her understanding of the French language
and culture.

Having just returned from a year’s
stay as an Instructor of English at a Ger-

V man university I am quite familiar with

European criticism of the U.S. Much of it
justifiably concerns our narrow-mind-
edness. Europeans, who from early years
are taught foreign languages, culture and
literature, find it inconceivable that we
view these as second-rate courses or at
best as a necessary evil.

An American in Germany who can ~

manage to understand and speak the lan-
guagereasonably well and to discuss the
political and cultural scene is normal-
ly received with sheer surprise and sub-
sequently with open admiration. Such a
person is regarded as‘ a rare breed of Am-
erican.

I found myself trying to excuse us and
rationalize our system, but deep down in-
side ‘I felt that the Europeans were correct
in their criticism. Thus’ my consterna-
tion upon- returning to the U.S. at finding
a movement underway to banish the lan-
guage requirement. = _

If some'of the language requirement
critics at Pitt were entirely sincere, they
would admit, as have students of mine,
that their main objection to languages is

moron to the army, he will still come out a moron.”

their difficulty and the frequency of class
meetings.
five times a week to provide one with a
genuine exposure to the language. The for-

mer, objection is a tribute to the intellec-

tual anemia of some critics, the latter to
their laziness.

The university should resist attempts
to offer a large number of courses, such
as those dealing with ghetto and welfare
problems, etc. These are very practical
topics best dealt with on the local level
within a neighborhood group or govern-
ment agency where firsthand insightand
experience are gained.

Sociology courses do. however, at-
tempt to treat those problems at the uni-
versity level. But, at the very moment that
the university succumbs to offering a
large dose of such practical courses at the
expense of other liberal arts instruction,
it becomes little more than '31 trade school.

I admit that the language requirement
as it presently exists needs review and
revision. I wholeheartedly agree with
those critics who seek more cultural in-
struction and believe they -will be suc-
cessful in their endeavors.

In fact, the German department has
already taken steps to achieve this end.
But the foreign language requirement
should remain. ‘

It is time for us to stop not seeing
the forest for the trees; it is time for us
to look beyond our own goals, our neigh-
borhood, our nation; it is time for us to
defend our liberal education, of which
the foreign language requirement is a
necessary part.

I Shut Up Bigots

Editor, The Pitt News,

If you knew me, you would more than
likely classify me as a meek and reserved
white individual. But there has to come a
time when the meek have to speak their
mind on issues that turn them into irate
and disgusted persons.

When a person in the Hillman Library
(I won’t mention names because this per-
son’s attitude is so depictive of a great
majority of students and c_itizens) looks
at the new Afro-American collection and
comments, “They should burn it!

“They should/burn them, too!” then
I think the time has come for the masses
to stop and consider the whole picture
of mass bigotry.

I think the time has come to speak
out against the ignorant and bigoted mass-
es of “citizens.” I am convinced that if
these people had been born black that they
would view the situation in a different
light.

They would understand why their

black brothers must struggle in such a bi-
ased world. Please_do a good deed for your
conscience and your country today, fellow
students and brothers: shut up a BIGOT!
Remind him or her that they live in a world
of people, not races!

§_' new pattern to the students’
5' wishes.

In what could prove to be a na-
tionally significant court case.
six Pittsburgh colleges and uni-
versities have challenged the
validity of a city ordinance that
would tax the gross receipts of
the city’s nonprofit institutions.

The colleges’ petition to the
Supreme Court of Pennsylvania
says:

“The issue raised in this case
is of great importance and.con-
cern since it places in question
the power of many municipal bod-
ies in this commonwealth . . . to
tax institutions of purely public
charity . . . Such institutions have
traditionally been exempt from
all forms of taxation.” (Duquesne
University of the Holy Ghost v.
City of Pittsburgh.)

In legal terminology, the desig-
nation “public charity” includes
nonprofit educational institutions.

The case stems from a 1965
local tax enabling act (53 P.S.
6901-6924), passed by the Penn-
sylvania legislature. which au-
thorized local units of govern-
ment to- levy and collect taxes
“on persons, transactions, occu-
pations, privileges, subjects,
andpersonal property within the
limits of such political subdivi-
sions.”

In December, 1968, the Pitts-
burgh city council enacted an or-
dinance which would impose a
tax “upon the privilege of con-
ducting or operating a service or
service institution in /the city of
Pittsburgh as measured by the
gross receipts derived from all
service transactions .' . .”

The ordinance exempted only
government subdivisions and ag-
encies and elementary and secon-
dary schools from the tax.

With most of the nation’s ma-
jor cities desperately seeking
A additional sources of revenue, it
would be difficult to overesti-
mate the importance of this case

  

SELF-DESIGNED

COURSE

The University Center for
International Studies (UCIS)
in conjunction with the College
of Arts and Sciences and the
Undergraduate Academic
Council, has announced a plan
whereby juniors and seniors
in groups of eight or more may
design their own courses in
the area of international stud-
ies.

Courses will offer three
credits and will last for one
if term. They may follow a lec-
5: ture of seminar approach,

The UCIS will offer all pos-
sible assistance to the group,
including financial assistance.’
Student course proposals
must be submitted for approv-
al to UCIS, who. will make
awards, on the basis of origin-
ality of the topic, the academic
rigor of the proposal, the rel-
evance as an educational ex-
perience, and the relevance to

the international field.
Course proposal forms can

be obtained from the UCIS

to higher education throughout the
country.

If the Pittsburgh ordinance
should be upheld by the court,
it could be expected that other
cities would seek to impose sim-
ilar taxes.

The decisionon the case may
depend on whether the Pennsyl-
vania legislature, .in authorizing
local subdivisions to levy taxes
on the “dues, fees, or assess-
ments of charitable, beneficial,
or nonprofit organizations,” in-
tended to include institutions of
higher education. '

The court will not be restrict-
ed to the actual wording of the act
in question in hearing the case.
In the interpretation of statutes,
it is customary for a court to re-
view the recorded discussions
and debates in legislative commit-
tees and on the floor of the legis-
lature while the bill is under dis-
cussion, to determine the intent
of the legislation. '

A California court in 1953 said:
“In determining whether a chari-
table corporation is entitled to
tax exemption. a strict but rea-
sonable construction must be
given to the language used in the
statute to the end that a tax ex-
emption may neither be enlarged
nor extended beyond the plain
meaning of the language.” (Good-
will Industries v. Los Angeles
County, 254 P 2c 877. )

  City Universities Challenge  
“ Legality of ‘Institution Tax’

The tax immunity of education-
al institutions and other chari-
table organizations has a long his-
tory in Anglo-American law. In
the Middle Ages, the more power-
ful feudal barons and the pre-
lates of the church were able to
resist the demands of the crown
for revenue. Any contributions
they made were regarded as gifts.

During the Reformation, when
many monasteries were closed
and their lands distributed to no-
bles, many charitable functions
performed by the church —— in-
cluding education -— were as-
sumed by other organizations.
The tax immunity enjoyed by the
church was extended to these
charitable institutions.

It was generally assumed that,
since these organizations were
performing a service of great
value to the public, their fi-
nancial ability to do so should not
be reduced by being compelled

V to make payments to the public

treasury. This IS still the ration-
ale relied upon LO justify‘ the tax
exemption extended to education-
al and other charitable corpora-
tions.

It is generally agreed, howev-
er, that the power of the state to-
tax is plenary, restricted only
by its constitution, the good judg-
ment and discretion of the legis-
lators, and their fear of loss of
votes at the next election.

Penn State Hang-Up

by Roy Jacobs Sports Editor

, When it comes to beating Penn State, varsity athletes at
Pitt get all uptight. .
The football team lost 65-9, the hoopsters have dropped
eleven straight to the Lions, the gymnasts lost by 57 points
_ ‘(which is worse than losing a football game 65-9). Even when
_. the track team beat Penn State last week, it was the first time
in 16 years. ' » -
There is no excuse for Penn State to
‘win all three places in all six events of a
gymnastics meet against a school of Pitt’s 
size (if not Pitt’s calibre). Yet, the gym- 2. 
nastics program here remains in limbo.

Outside of a coaching change, noth-

ing has been done to insure that next year’s ‘V

. football. team will lose by less than 56 
points to the Lions.  '

But is this imbalance going to be con- ' ‘C A '

tinued? Pitt was meant to be good rival for Roy Jacobs
Penn State in all sports, not just a breather

on the schedule. But little can be done towards this aim unless
‘sentiment on campus changes to one favoring such additions
'1 as a revised physical education program and possibly a school
. of business.

There is a list of contradictions between Pitt and Penn
State as long as this writer’s arm. All of them contribute to
the athletic. imbalance. Just one example is that a junior at
Penn State needs only 48 credits to play football. Here he
‘needs 60. '

, But, like the track team, there is another winter athletic
squad ready to challenge the odds against them at University
"Park this Saturday evening. Dave Adams is priming his wrest-
f -lers for a crucial match with the Lion Matmen.

;—_ You see, last year the Penn State President said that Pitt
could never compete on the same level as PSU in wrestling.
[After beating the varsity here last year, 23-9, the Lion coach
Hsaid that his team had more trouble putting on their uni-
.. -forms in the locker room before the meet than they had with
the varsity.

‘ The, fact is that three individual bouts last year were de-'
cided by one point —— all to Penn State. Reverse them, and you
reverse the final outcome.

_ Dave Adams Willkeep the above comments fresh in his
wrestlers’ minds all week. But they need support from other
areas, too. West Virginia fans drive hours to Pittsburgh for
basketball games. Notre Dame turns fans out for away games.
.Why not drive to Penn State? It only takes a little over two
-hours. They can beat Penn State Saturday, but they need‘
=_. your help.‘

Ridl Returns to Westminster 
As Opposing Coach Tonight 

By JERRY L. GRUEBEL
Assistant Sports Editor

New Wilmington, Pennsyl-
vania used to be home for bas-
ketball coach Buzz Ridl, but
tonight he returns to the con-
fines of Westminster’s Titan
Field House a foe.

Tonight's contest between the
two rivals marks the third and
deciding game of this ‘season's
three—game slate. Shortly before
the trimester break. the cagers
edged the Titans, 59-52, in the
opening round of the Steel Bowl
at the Civic Arena. Last month.
Westminster gained revenge at
Field House with a 65-64. vic-
tory.

- “I hate to play against them,”
said Ridl, who coached the Ti-
tans for twelve years prior to
this season. “When we win, I
can’t be that happy because they
lost. When we lost . . . . well, I
don’t like that at all."

The cagers do not have any of
the sentimental reluctance their
coach has; they would like noth-
ing more than to break a four-
game losing streak against an-
other winning Westminster five.

Once again. the cagers will
have to worry about "Buppy’ De-
Joseph and Russ Boston. The two
senior scorers are both averaging
close to 18 points per game this
season.

In the first two contests be-
tween the rivals, DeJoseph- con-
tributed 20 and 13 points. con-
secutively. Boston rolled up 12
and 18 point performances.

But the cagers know only too
well that stopping either De-
Joseph or Boston is not stopping

Westminster. -Noted for a well.

balanced team, the Titans
have other talent worth worrying
about. In fact, in last month’s loss
it wasn’t either of the two sen-
iors that decided the-one-point
decision, but a sophomore from
Mt. Lebanon. .

With just 6 seconds remaining
in the game, guard Gary Brown

threw in a foul shot that gave
Westminster a split with the
cagers at the time.

Brown. who didn’t gain a start-
ing berth until after the first
battle against the cagers, has rais-
ed his scoring average to better
than 6 points. However. the Pitts-
burgh native is far more danger-
ous than the statistics show.

Brown saw little playing time
earlier in the season, and even
while he’s in the game the quick
ball-handler is looking for the
pass.

So. the cagers have a lot of
work cut out for them. Especial-
ly since they’ve managed just
one road victory all season.

Scott Still Out ,
Cubs in Final Outings

by BILL NAAB ‘

This. week the Panther basketball Cubs get their last chance

of the year to show their stuff —- that they’re capable of lifting
the varsity to respectability during the next three years. '

Tonight the Cubs travel to a foreign court with hopes of annihi-
lating the Little Titans of Westminster. Saturday, they visit Carnegie-

 

Buzz Ridl

Mellon. Last Saturday night Coach Tim Grgurich was exceptionally
pleased when his squad breezed past the University’s Johnstown Cam-

pus. 99-64.

“Along with the Robert M61»
ris and West Virginia games, Sa-
turday’s game was the best we’ve
played this year. The team's
starting to do things now on their
own that they weren’t doing earl-
ier.” Grgurich said. ‘

Since the Cubs last played the
Westminster JV’s, the squad has
shown flashes of greatness, but
also have had their rough spots.
Grgurich remarked that playing
the likes of Duquesne, West Vir-
ginia, and Youngstown has im-
proved the club. However, he
indicated that freshmen are in-
consistent and anything could
happen in the last two games.

“We expect Westminster to
press us and use the man -to man
defense, and we’ll do the same.
'_I‘h'ey,handled and moved the ball

well and also shot well, in the
first game.” stated Grgurich.

In that game. the Titans stun-
ned the Cubs 26-23 at halftime.
However. the Cubs poured in 44
points in the second half and
won. 67-49. “We have good
shooters. and they can do the job
if they have to,” Grgurich said.

Westminster, however, is ex-
pected to be much tougher to
handle tonight than they were in
the initial contest. Freshman Ray
Bridge, a 6’8’’ center from La-
trobe, 'has_ transferred from
Clemson and should definitely
bolster the Titans. In addition,
Kent Scott will still be missing
from the Cub lineup.

A win tonight and one at
CMU on Saturday would post the
Cub record to 9-5 and strengthen
the hopes for the future. ,

 Match at
State on Tap
For Matmen

 _,With only two dual meets re-
'‘maining this season, the matmen
have their work cut out for them
:._to finish with a .500 overall mark.

=,rneet Penn State and Leheigh on
‘consecutive weeks and both op-

;“This week's match is the big
fone,” commented coach Dave
Adams. “We’ve got to beat Penn
State. I hope we can get some stu-
fdents driving up to State for the
gniatch. The crows would really
help us.”

V Penn State stands 4-3-1 on the
season, with their latest victory
being a 22-12 triumph over a good
Lehigh squad. Against common
opponents, the grapplers and
_;Penn -State stand on about equal
‘terms. State tried Army (16-16).

Universities

Host ROTC

Controversy

One of the largest controver-
sies on campus this year has
been on the removal of academic
credit from the ROTC program.
Student hostility toward the war
and university complicity with the
government manifested itself in
growing protests against mili-
tary training of this type.

But this trouble is not restrict-
ed to the University of Pittsburgh.
This week the Harvard faculty
voted to withdraw academic stat-
us from its ROTC program, the
oldest in the nation. The director
of the program said he would
recommend to the Pentagon that
ROTC be ended at Harvard.

Yale took similar action last
week, stripping ROTC of academ-
ic credit and relegating it to ex-
tra-curricular status. Dartmouth
College the next day announced
it would limit credit to only two
courses. Western Maryland Col-
lege said it would no longer re-
quire students to take ROTC.
The University of Pennsylvania
recently withdrew credit. Cornell
is expected to take some action
soon. Beginning this year, Johns
Hopkins University will not count
ROTC credit toward degrees. Ni-
agara University will not require
sophomores to take the courses.
Freshman ROTC enrollment is
down 50 per cent at Catholic Uni-
versity, 25 per cent at the Univer-
sity of Iowa.

Elimination of credit was one
of the early demands of militants
at San Francisco State College.
but the issue has apparently been
drowned by others. At Lehigh Uni-
versity, the question of credit is
under study. In October. 300 stu-
dents protested ROTC and the
university’s “military mind."
The student government at the
University of Pennsylvania voted
for removal of academic credit.
but the president vetoed the bill
until the issue could be studied
further. The Michigan Daily edi-
torialized. “No academic value.
no academic credit." The St. Lou-
is University faculty revoked
ROTC credit in December.

At Temple University in Phila-
delphia, activist anti-war stu-
dents have flocked to ROTC.
There, the acronym stand for
“Resistance on Temple Cam-
pus.”

When Yale stripped ROTC of
its academic status. a faculty
member compared the program
to “singing in the Whiffenpoofs."
He called it “a perfectly fine ac-
tivity” but not deserving of cred-
it. But to many, an ROTC course
in “counter—guerrilla warfare” is
not quite the same thing as sing-
ing in a choral society.

‘Rumor’:
Women Are
People’?!

Mrs. Wilma Scott Heide. asso-
ciate research scientist for the‘
American Institute of Research.
will speak on the topic “Women
are People” tomorrow at 12:15
p.m. in the SU Supper Room.

Mrs. Heide is also president
of the Pittsburgh area chapter of
the National Organization for
Women (NOW), an organization
“trying to keep alive the rumor
and, more important, the real-
ity that women are people.”

NOW, formed in 1966, attempts
to bring women into full partici-
pation in the mainstream of Am-
erican society.

The Student-Faculty Lunch
Discussion, sponsored by the

YWCA and the University and

City Ministries. is open to the en-

-tire University community.
