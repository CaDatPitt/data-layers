Dr. Ernest Sternglass. a pro-
fessor of radiation physics at Pitt.
continued his plea,Tuesday for the
recognition of the_ dangers in‘ the
commercial usage of nuclear,pow-
er. as he linked leakage levels of
the local Shippingport nuclear re-
actor with statistics on infant
mortality and leukemia incidence
at nearby Aliquippa. Speaking to
"Friends of the Earth“ at the Uni-
tarian Church at Shadyside. his
announcement marked a major
step in what has become a more
than 10-year effort for the Pitt
professor. -

Sternglass has long held that

"we have underestimated the sen- ,

sitivity of the fetus and the infant
to radioactivity by as much as
100 to 1,000 times.“ Sternglass ex-
pounds this theory in his book.
Low-Level Radiation.

He further contends that the
chemical similarity of the radio-
active isotope, Strontium 90, to
calcium, may be an explanatory‘
cause of leukemia, and that radio-

On Monday, Feb. 12, through
Thursday, Feb. 15, the University
Counseling Service will sponsor
the Winter Session of the Career
Seminar Series. The Seminars
will be held from 12 noon to 3:30
p.m. in the Student Union Ball-
room.-

Mondays seminar is entitled
"Careers in Social Work and Ur-
ban Affairs“; Tuesday. “Careers
in Education‘ and Related Areas";
Wednesday. “Career Opportun-
ities for Blacks and Other Minor-
ities." and Thursday. "Seminar
in Majors and Programs of Study
at Pitt." -

The Seminars are designed so

that a student may discuss job-

opportunities, including personal
and financial rewards, part-time
experiences, further education
and personal requirements on a
one-to-one basis with a profession-
al who is actively employed in the
students particular field of inter-
est.

 Ed Sites. associate professor in

\

the Graduate School of Social

Work and career representative -

for Monday's seminar thinks the
seminars are helpful_ because
"students don't think broadly
about career opportunities. The
Seminars will provide them with
the opportunity to meet people
who are involved in different ca-
reers and learn about the breadth
of things they can get into."

In the past week. with the an-

nouncement of the Presidents new

budget which dissolved many so-
cial service oriented organiza-

tions including the Office ofEqual ‘
Opportunity (CEO). the job mar-
ket for social__ workers may ap- "

pear bleak;

'hence,

activity lessens the body’s resis-

tance to other chronic illnesses."

Said Sternglass, “Four hundred

thousand children died in excess .

of expectationbetween the early
50’s and the end of the ,60’s.”
what was formerly
thought to be a “safe man-made
background level” may be in ex-
cess of the tolerance capacity
during the fetal period and in the
first years of _,life, as well as in
the age range aboveT55, which is

also a period of physical senstiv-.

ity for the body.

Now he feels he has conclusive
evidence “beyond any reasonable
doubt." Aliquippa. which is lo-
cated nine miles east of Shipping-
port." has had abnormally high
rates of infant mortality and leu-

‘ kemia incidence within the last

few years. _

"During the period 1969-71."
said Sternglass.. "Aliquippa was
first among 98 localities in the
rate of infant mortality. while in
1964 it was ranked 64th.“ Citing
figures from "Pennsylvania Vital

Sites, however, is optimistic
about the employment outlook in
his field. He explains that several
years ago graduates had nine to
10 different job offers to chose
from, now they have only one or
two. “There is not as much selec-

tion as there used to be, but there i

are jobs. We are not as bad off as
other disciplines.” '

Sites maintains that despite the
President’s drastic budget cuts.
dollars will become available.
"You cannot hold back the pub-
lic‘s demand for services.“

In the interim there are non-

public dollars in voluntary pri--

vate agencies operated by church-
es or homes for the aged. Social
work as a private practice dealing
with family counseling or child
care will most certainly expand.

Sites ﬁorsees that there are un-
tapped job opportunities which
will become available to gradu-
uates as~.social work moves more
heavily into policy and planning,
or “system.attacks.” ..

Where previously social work-
ers had dealt on a micro level in
casework. family counseling. and
personal ‘‘ problem
they are now also. dealing on a
macro level as they attempt to ini-
tiate institutional changes which
will prevent many of the prob-
lems with which they have dealt
for years. I

Sites believes that social work-
ers are uniquely qualified to do
this as they have "the most com-
prehensive look at people and
their needszl social work com-
bines the knowledge of so many
disciplines: anthropology. politi-
cal science. education. the. cler-

Statistics." Sternglass pointed
out that during 1970. "The rate of
infant mortality for Aliquippa was
43.9 per 1.000 births. as compared
to a state-wide average of 20.2.
more than double the average
rate." \

“In leukemia deaths,” said
Sternglass, “Aliquippa had risen
from a 34th ranking in 1964, with
8.7 deaths per 100,000, as com
pared to a state-wide average of
7.5.” At the same time, says
Sternglass, “Shippingport was
having a serious leakage problem,
and was shut down for repairs for
a month in 1970 and in l971.”

Nixon Foreign Policy, Discussed 

by JOHN AMSON CAPITMAN
and HEIDI D. LEVIN

Dr. Hans Morganthau. speaking
on the foreign policy of the second

. Nixon administration. cited kinds

of "situations and problems that
the United States must face dur-
ing this administration: our rela-
tions with the communists. our re-
lations with our allies. our rela-
tions with the Third World. nu-
clear weapons and disarmament.
and finally our domestic situa-
tion."

The Tuesday evening lecture.
given in the Frick Fine Arts Au-
ditorium. was sponsored by the
School of General Studies Student
Cabinet. the Department of Mill-
tary Science. and the Graduate

School of Public and International
Affairs. N

Morganthau, author of Politics
Among Nations. cited the “prag-
matic tone” of the Governments
“public statements concerning
the communist nations” as a
“major step forward compared
to the idiological arguments
against what was once called
‘godless communism.”’

He wention to say that such
moves as the "beginning of the
normalization of relationships“

with the Peoples Republic of China.
‘and the beginning of "trade and

other economic relationships”
with the Soviet Union suggest "a
policy of positive movement in-
stead of idealogical squabbling

ed the plan.

In that memorandum. it was re-
vealed that the optional meal plan
would not be open to freshmen
and some "aid“ students. while
upperclassmen would have a

/ choice of several meal plans. An-

nounced also were the room rates
for fall term—$-110 for a double
room. $445 for a single room.
These rates include $78 which was
previously generated by a sur-
charge applied to the food serv-
ice rate. '

The memorandum raised ques-
tions concerning possible discrim-
ination against freshmen and the
“aid”_ students. Jeff Pasek an-
nounced that Legal Awareness
was readying for a possible law
suit on that promise.. x

In order to clear up these ques-
tions. Vrana described to The Pitt

which argues well for the future."'

The second problem area with
which the Nixon administrationﬂs

foreign policy will have to deal. »  

according to Morganthau, isour
relationships with allied nations
in E-urope as well as Japan. He

said that the U.S. has “quite need- . N
lessly antagonized the Japanese a

"who because of their economic

strength and “strategic location  
in relation to the Soviet Union and .

China hold a key position in world
politics."

Morganthau stressed the im- 
portance of building “economic .\

and financial ties with the Euro-
pean Common Market, which will
recreate those favorable rela-

tions of. trust and mutual assis-  

tance which existed in the past,

but which have recently deterior-N I,

ated.”

As for Nixon policy toward the_ -
Third World. Morganthau point-/’ :
ed out that "in the past we havei.:_-[
had an ethnocentic, paternalisticggg
and neo-colonialistic attitude,” I .
which should be replaced “if we. .

are to behave rationally, by a po-

licy of what might be called ab— .. ’ 
stentionismf‘

Abstentionism, Morganthau‘-
later explained. is based upon
"the realization that the oligar-
cllic government of the so—called
“under—developed" nations would
commit political suicide if they
were to allow positive change, so

at least the United States must 
stay out of their affairs and rec-' V" '.

ognize the inevitability of revolu-

tions. and at the most support‘ I

those revolutions so that "we may
be on the right side of history."
The political analyst, however,
believes that “the most important
problem which the Nixon admin-
istration must come to terms with

is that of nuclear power, a/factor ; 4, 
of unparalleled and unimaginable‘ ~ 

significance.” P

(Continued from Page 1)

One of these was that boarding
with the University would be ad-
vantageous to freshmen until they

1 settled in the Oakland environ-

ment.

Another, more pressing reason
was the general refusal of every
food service concern surveyed to
enter a contract without a guar-

‘ anteed base of participation. This
is due in large to the local Food
Service/Unions which have 're-

‘ _ quirements on the number and

type of workers which must be
employed.

Finally, Vrana stated that hav-
ing such a base of participation
would yield a price benefit to all

1 those taking part in the plan.

According to Vrana, the an-
nounced plan was arrived at after
a study, starting last October,
which revealed that of 160 univer-
sities investigated, none had tried
to make the transfer from a man-
datory meal plan to a totally op-
tional one in one_move. The pre-
sent plan, which has been sub-
mitted by Vrana for /the approval
of the administration, was mod-

‘ eled on suggestions from Student

1 ‘ Government and both residence

hall councils.

It was revealed that there will
be a choice, for upperclassmen,
of plans whichinclude 19, 14, 10,
5, or 0 meals per week. A tenta-
tive upper limit on the maximum
combined room and board fees
has been set at $1,310 per year.
Vrana said that he sees "no rea-
son why the plan should not be
approved." .

Vrana answered charges of

by DAVE MAJERNIK

A new human development cen-
ter, called the Arica Institute, has
opened a Pittsburgh office at 4915
Center Ave. in Oakland.

This New York—headquartered
organization, with other centers
in Los Angeles, San Francisco,
Boston, Miami, and Washington,
D. C., uses methods developed by
a 41-year-old Bolivian named Os-
car Ischazo.

According to an Arica~press re-
lease, Ischazo systematized the
esoteric knowledge of South
America, China, Afghanistan, and
Tibet into a form usefulto West-
erners. The release continues:

“In 1970, Ischazo invited a
group of? 57 Americans, ranging in
age from 21 to 56, representing all
classes and professions, to Arica
(from which came the organiza-
tion’s name), Chile, where he
trained them for 10 months. Peo-
ple in the group experienced pro-
found changes during this time.
Forty-four of them elected to re-
main together, form a school, and
pass Ischazo’s technique to
others.”

_ The Institute currently offers
two basic programs. The first is
called “The Open Path,” a 16-hour
training period for “developing
three essential functions which
make a human being.”

/umon   Development Center Ope

"When these three functions;
the body and vitality, the emo-
tions, and the mind are properly
balanced, there emerges, quite
naturally in an individual the
fourth essential function,” ac-
cording to Arica, “which we know
as the human spirit.”

‘ The second program offered by
Arica is a 40-day intensive train-
ing. Arica says that the primary
goals of this program are “to in-
crease vitality ‘and energy, de-
crease frequency and duration of

negative emotional states and re-

place them with positive ones, and
to radically decrease the useless
mental chatter (internal vocaliza-
tion).”

 Nixon Foreign Policy Discussed

(Continued from Page I)

tional means toward rational

ends, use of nuclear devices would

be an act of both suicide and geno-
cide.” He emphasized the essen-
tial nature of the SALT talks, but
make it clear that “they will be
useless unless they effectuate a
decrease in the super-abundance
of nuclear war-heads.

Finally, Morganthau dealt with

—~ the “ethos of American society”

as it has been and “will continue
to be effected by our foreign po-
licy.” The Nixon administration
must realize that “the moral com-
mitmentof being American and to
living up to the promise of Amer-
ica is rapidly fading.”

“So,” he continued, “we must.

be sensitive to domestic prob-
lems, and develop programs and
policies that at least approximate
the ideals upon which this coun-
try is founded. If not, the only al-
ternative is repression at home,
and a repressive, neo-colonial for-
eign policy.”

“Foreign policy will be worth-

less,” concluded iMorganthau,
“if the second Nixon administra-
tion fails to restore the self-image
of America.”

At his press conference, Mor-
ganthau identified Nixon as “cour-
‘ ageous and quite estute” in his
foreign policy during his first
term in office, but added that
most of the creditfor this policy
should be granted to Henry Kis-
singer. ,
Morganthau ventured that Kis-
singer probably came up with all
the major tenants of the Nixon for-
eign policy program, and merely
“fed” the ideas to the President.

“Kissinger,” Morganthau stated.
"has always been out for power.
He’s tried to find the ivory tow-
er of knowledge,”
maintained that the Special Pres-
idential Advisor would not hold
himself to personal convictions if
to do so would in any way jeapor—
dize his position of power;

Morganthau further theorized
that as long as Kissinger was in

Morganthau .

the administration the position of
Secretary of State would remain
weak, because Kissinger would
not accept a serious challenge to
his power from the Department of
State.

When questioned about recent
attempts to curb journalists, Mor-
ganthau responded with the belief
that the administration is in-
volved in a “clear attempt to
stifle the news media,” adding
that the executive office’s dedica--
tion to civil liberties is at best
only slight.

Morganthau explained that
scholarsand journalists serve as
an opposition party in this coun-
try, asking questions and main-
taining pressure on the govern-
ment to help prevent abuse of
power.

When asked if he feltthe people
of the world were learning to live
with each other, Morganthau
shook his head and said that as
much as he would like to answer
yes, evidence prevented him from
offering a positive response. ‘

The methods used by Arica pro-
grams are meditation, physical
exercising, chanting, group inter-
personal exercises, individual
analytic assignments, training ex-
ercises for body balancing and en-
ergy movement, theatre and
dance, and lecture presentations.

The cost of the 40-day training
is $600, while the Open Path costs
$50 in general and $30 for stu-
dents.

Open Path programs will be of-
fered here on Feb. 11 and 12, 10
a.m. to p.m. at the Motor Lodge,

There is also no seniorityisys-
tem in Arica, according to Bleib-
trew.

“We are all equal. Just because
a horse is the oldest, it doesn’t
mean that he is the smartest,” he
said.

Bleibtrew reported that Arica
trainees come from a variety of
backgrounds: /housewives, hip-
pies, drug addicts, psychiatrists,
professors, and authors. The me-

dian age of trainees is 28. Out of ,
P the 350 people who have taken the

40-day program, only two or three

have not experienced great, posi-

tive changes, he said.

The Institute hopes to offer the
40-day program here in_ Pitts-

burg later this spring, depending '

  Legal “Awareness”?

By RALPH DEAN

. .1 There are, as anyone who’s been around Pitt tor any University)
" for very long can tell you, a lot of official University policies which
/ irritate and arouse members of the student body. These can be brok-
_~, en down into three general categories.

 The first group (and in institutions like Pitt it is a small one) in-
7 eludes policies which, due to a bias or corruption in members of
‘  the administration, are unfair and damaging to the students.

-. A second group consists of policies which are in force because
7.? the Universityvhas no other option due to outside constraints, some of
 I ‘which are not blatantly obvious. 1

. ,‘ The third group consists ,of policies and programs which are
. merely antiquated or are extant through shortsighted or misinformed
i ‘administrators. These policies can (and need to be) changed through
Q. (student activity.

( Student “activists" however, must exercise some judgement in
,.their choice of targets.

. Jeff Pasek and his quixotic associates at Legal Awareness are in
.;.]tlg'e process of making a big blunder. They have chosen to attack,
1.. most probably through lawsuit, Housing’s announced optional meal
_ program, which retains mandatory board for freshmen and “aid”
-students.

 Pasek stated Tuesday’ that such a policy was “discriminating
. against freshmen and the poorer students.“ Yet. a couple of days
giearlier, John Vrana, Director of Housing. had explained to Pasek

‘privately the reasons for the move-that a study had been made
» which showed that an immediate transfer to a total optional mean
’: plan had not been attempted by 160 other schools in the same sit-
. nation, and that no food service company would enter such a situa-
_1 Vtionwithout an assured base of participation. The reluctance of the
I food service people is due primarily to the unionized labor situa-
_-:.-"tion here, which makes a gamble on student participation a potentia
' ibusinessdisaster. ‘ _ , I
 In that conversation, -Pasek. by his own admission». did not ask
.—j'f"just who were the “aid" students involved. Had he bothered. he
"would have found them to be strictly athletes or R.A‘.~Is. whose par-
ticipation in the plan can be argued for quite effectively. I
I’ One wonders whether Pasek and Co. really thought that the peo-
_‘ple in the Housing Department were planning, for some perverse
A and unimaginable reason, to persecute freshmen and poor students.
 f . One also wonders whether Pasek chose to act now and ask later

for the sake of initiating a legal battle. especially when one. consid-
 ers the way the Legal Awareness people love to play junior-public
ggdefender with student money.
 If this isthe sort of poor judgement that "Pasek Associates"
 chooses to exercise, perhaps a hard look at the validity of their bud-

.getf(which is funded by your activities fee) is in order. Most of
A the administrators at this University don't have an office layout as
:._”_ elaborate as that of Legal Awareness.
.';.)The proposed optional meal plan is a workable one. and a big
 step forward for dormitory students. An unnecessary lawsuit against
 it ’is doomed to failure. There are enough administrative dragons
J around Pitt that Pasek and Legal Awareness have no need to go
 about seeking windmills.

A Column And A Half

By JOHN METCALFE

Today I would like to share one of my trea-
sures with whoever is out there. It is a Letter
From The Edit.ors. We have trouble getting let-
ters to the Editor around here. but that is probab-
ly due to the recent fad of Apathy.

This. however. is a genuine Letter From The
Editors. the Editors of TIME Magazine. no less.
I am impressed by it.--—

In the past I have received assorted communi-
cations from TIME-LIFE Inc. Mostly they have
been dunning letters for my various subscriptions.
notices that said subscriptions are about to expire.
or offers to sell me endless series of square books
on an astonishing variety of subjects. They never
say how many volumes are in a given series. I
have bought some anyway.

Back to the present case.

It all began when I wrote a Letter To The Ed-
itors of TIME, as I sometimes do when they have
annoyed me. It was just after their selection of R.
Nixon and H. Kissinger as joint Men Of The Year.
I wrote, roughly:

"You must have chosen your Men Of The
Year very early in December. The War has re-
appeared from behind their smiles and the bombs
go roaring down.

"Likely we will have a War Issue for our
Bicentennial election."

That was the general tone of it. You can see
how much I enjoy capitalizing words lately.
Seems to give them real Significance.

A few weeks later. I got a letter. from a cer-
tain Isabel Kouri. “for the Editors.“ Isabel Kouri

» must herself be an important personage at TIME.

The typist‘s signature at the bottom suggests that
someone else. with the initials “mc“ did the ac-
tual work of preparing the missive.

Isabel Kouri signed the letter in blue ball-
point.

Now to the contents.

“Dear Mr. Metcalfe:

Since the inception of the tradition forty-five
years ago, TIME’s Man of the Year selection has
been made on the basis of impact on the news,
a logical criterion for a news magazine. In 1972
President Nixon and Dr. Kissinger were consist-
ently in the central spotlight of world attention,
and by virtue of their initiatives and actions in
foreign affairs affected the course of history more
significantly than any other men or women in
the news. It does not seem to be an exaggeration
to say as we did in our story that\the Nixon-Kiss-
inger‘ team has'been accomplishing the most pro-
found rearrangements of the world’s political
powers in twenty-five years, but we also made‘
it clear that these accomplishments of statesman-
ship were marred and diminished by the re-es-
calation of the war in Viet Nam and the break-
down in the peace negotiations. We criticized the
President as well for a narrow vision of Ameri-
can society and a record of legislative accom-
plishments that was unimpressive even measured
against his own stated goals. The Man of the
Year selection was never intended as a stamp of
total approval of a man’s policies and perform-
ance, and is certainly not an award for virtue and
honor, or for lack of virtue and honor.

"We regret that misunderstanding of the na-
ture and purpose of the selection persists among
some readers, but thank you for the opportunity
to discuss it here. Perhaps you saw the letters on
the Nixon-Kissinger selection which have been
running in recent columns.

Sincerely.

etc."

There it is. My first Letter From The Editors.

God. but those TIME people can write. I feel

chastised. instructed, and inclined to reform my
thinking all at the same time.

"I'll be just like that some day. My problem
is that I don't know what to get first, a sense of
style. a secretary. or a blue ball-point.

Dear Sir:

I attended the recent presenta- 1

tion by former Col. Anthony
Herbert at D.L. Hall. and would
like to register a belated coin-
plaint. Following his speech.
there was a question period. dur-
ing which a long—winded and
rambling questioner squandered
an entire 5 minutes of the aud-
ience's valuable time. At that
point. a number tan alarmingly
large number) of persons chose
chose to heap some ridicule on
that questioner. '

Before I explain my objection
further. let me state that I great-

] .

ly admired the Colonel, although
I found ‘his conspiratorial theor-
izing very simplistic. I say that
merely to avoid the standard epi-
taph of “fascist" which is so
popular.

Why is it that so many of us
are disgusted with all oppression,

“ until we have the opportunity to

oppress? The principle of free
speech has limits, to be sure, but
they are not the limits set by
mob rule. Whether it is Nixon
silencing the press, or -students
drowning out what they choose
not to hear; the principle in-
volved is the same.

The irony is that oppression—
the topic of Herbert's presenta-
tion was seen (admittedly in a
fairly harmless form) in his very
presence. Thoseresponsible are
not even introspective enough
to realize this.

I suspect this letter is a wast-
ed effort. for the point is too
complex for those who seemed

\

safe, abortions will open in Pitts-
burgh. In the meantime, women
who seek such services will have
to rely on the existing facilities
that are out of state. Even when
the Pittsburgh .,clinic opens. the
demand will probably be so heavy
that out-of-state abortions will
still be necessary.

Therefore, if you are consider-
ing having an abortion, it is ad-
visable that you obtain a refer-
ral from a reputable agency.
Pittsburgh women can obtain
such referrals right here in Pitts-

burgh without having to patronize

the agencies that are advertis-
ing in the Pitt News. Such agen-
cies may be good bu_t, then again,
they may not. Why take a chance?
Referrals to excellent facilities
can be obtained through the

to lack self-control; while it is,

shamefully obvious to those with
some restraint. Hence. my recep-

/tion is one of either boredom or.

literally, a dumb silence.

To paraphrase Col. Herbert. I
submit that there was another
"perfect job match“ right before
him— the unrestrained members
of the audience and the KKK.

If you are sexually active. it is
far better to use preventative

measures than to risk a possible 1

pregnancy. If, however, you
think that you may be pregnant
but are not sure, have a pregnan-
cy test done immediately to. find
out. If you are pregnant and
want to continue the pregnancy,
be sure that you obtain the best
prenatal care available so that
the risks to you and the risks of
birth defects are minimized.

If you intend to seek» an abor-ts.“

tion. however, do not delay
having the procedure done. Ear-
ly abortions are extremely safe
and less costly than later termin-
ations. Above all-. do not wait for
the Pittsburgh clinic to open.
You may delay the operation too
long.

You have the right to choose
and the right to refuse. Whatev-

you get the best care possible.

was not publicly available. An an-
nual operations report filed for
1971 to the Environmental Pro-
tection Agency (EPA) had stated,
"No gases were released due to
adequate hold-up capacity." But
coincidentally, the Nuclear Util-
ity Service Corporation, hired by
Duquesne Light Company for the
purpose of recording the base-lev-
el of radiation prior to the con-
struction of. two new power plants,
discovered otherwise.

i The sight of the construction of
the two proposed facilities, Beav-
er Valley Unit No. 1 and No. 2,

was immediately adjacent to the
‘Shippingport reactor; The data

compiled by NUS revealed high

concentrations of radioactive by- -

products in the area surrounding
the sight, and of particular con-
cern were the high concentra-
tions found in the milk of six local
dairies. . . _

Stated the-report, “The milk
‘samples’ containing these high
recounted
three times to verify these re-

sults,” but went on to say, “the‘

source of these radi'o_-nucleotides
has not been de/termined.”~Also,
says Sternglass, “NUS revealed
releases which were 10,000 to
100,000 times larger than that
which was previously reported to
the Atomic Energy Commission.”

In analyzing the new statistics 1'

compiled by NUS, Sternglass said
that ‘fthe emission levels for Ship-
pingport were found to correlate

with radioactivity concentrations

in the soil and in the milk.” Fur-

thermore, he said, “there is a‘
correlation with distance from the

plant — the further away, the
smaller ‘became the concentra-

tions of Strontium 90 and other
radioactive by—products." Finally.
"the concentrations of radioac-
tive by-products in the milk and
soil were found to fluctuate with
the power generated."

. "What, we now feel we have
shown beyond any question,“ said
Sternglass, “is that leukemia and
infant mortalityifose as the radia-

, tion level in the milk—r_ose.”

Sternglass -icalled for‘a “shut-
down of Shippingport’_’ an‘d\._a
“moratorium on further construc-
tion of all nuclear power plants”
until questions such as Whatis a
“safe” emission level? and Why
did AEC and EPA never check the
emission levels of Shippingport

‘that were reported to them? have
’ been answered.

Said Sternglass, "Now is the
time to consider whether nuclear
power’ plants can ’_be operated
safely, and not just economically
——when we are dependent on them
for only.one per cent of our total
power output. What is important
is life—not profit.” He ,listed al-
ternative sources of power as

the gassification of coal, fusion"

(Which, is much ‘cleaner than fis-
sion), geothermic energy (from
the inner earth), and ultimately.
solar energy. ’

Access- to Research Collections

‘ Library Materials Increased

by MONICA CIROCCO ,
The Center for Research Libraries, Chicago, Ill\.,

is a non-profit international organization maintain-‘

ed by over 60 member ‘institutions, including Hill-
man Library, for the purpose of increasing the li-
brary materials available to their readers.

V ‘ Many individual libraries simply cannot afford

to maintain certain research collections, so by be-
longing‘ to the center, a library may borrow ma-
terial for its readers. Unlike the usual inter-library

, loan procedure, materials borrowed‘ from the Cen-

ter, can be available within three to four days after
the request is made and may be kept for as long as
needed, though they remain subject to recall if
needed by another reader. Member libraries can
transmit their requests to the Center via collect
teletype, telephone, or telegram, and the Center
will send the material by United Parcel Service or
Air Parcel Post. A ’

Pam Palm, ,Hillman’s Interlibrary Loan Li-
brian, has announced that an additional service has
now been made possible by the Center. It has es-
tablished a loan service with the National Lending
Library (NLL) of Great Britain which will open in
the near future. The NHL is located in the center of

the country and lends journals to every library

tional lending library for journals in the U.S.

Palm briefly explained how the lending pro‘-0
cess will work. “A student needing a journal that
we do not have should inquire at the reference desk.‘
We will make the request to the Center, and if they"
have the journal it will arrive here usually within.
three days. If not, they, in turn, will make the re‘-‘
quest to the NLL, which will send the-journal by ai“
mail teletype or photocopy, directly to the indivi

‘She added that the Center will keep records of all"
member requests filled from the NLL ’collecti'ori
and if the number of requests for a particular jour-
nal becomes great, the Center will entersits own‘:
subscription at the first opportunity and: provide,,
then, access from its own collection. The 'Cen't,erf

no extra charge to-_,-the students for the services

Pittsburgh Roads Make Driving Hazardous

ways in this area are the Park-
ways _(east and west), our pri-
mary gift from Harrisburg in the
last few years or decades.

The Parkways are overcrowd-
ed and dangerous. All types of ve-
hicles crowd these four lane high-
ways——traveling at high speed.
Trucks have a speed limit of 55
mph but often exceed this.

This summer alone several fa- -

tal and large chain-reaction acci-
dents occurred involving trucks.
These accidents often shut off a
whole segment of lanes in one di-
rection, forcing traffic_ to be
dumped onto inadequate alter-
nateiroutes.

tion center is being handled.

“Ninety per cent of the cost of
the new convention center is be-
ing paid for by the government
but City Council can’t- make up
their minds where to put it,” he
said.

Further commenting, Lucchino
stated that “Housing is terrible
in Pittsburgh and I’m not just
talking about the Hill District or
the South Side. There are no funds
availableifor middle income peo-
pleeither. *

“City Council is in a race with
‘the mayor to lower taxes, because
it’s an election year. I think low-
ering taxes is fine but not when
the money is needed someplace
else.” ’

Later in a question and answer
session, Lucchino was asked if
he was pro-Flaherty or anti-Flah-
erty. He replied “neither” but in-
stead was.“pro-good city council
government.“

way have often been ignored. Just
recently a section of the
Parkway West near Carnegie was
rerouted while an interchange for
1-79 was built.

This was an excellent time to .
I widen the Parkway to six lanes in

that area but nothing was done.

The very layout of the Park-
ways, particularly the exits, leave
much to be desired. Highway en-
gineers freely admit that the
Parkways were -experiments. Les-
sons, such as how long to make an
exit ramp, learned here have aid-
ed highway builders elsewhere
but nobody came back to clean up.

If you take the ramp from West
End to the Ft. Pitt bridge to go to-
wards Monroeville, you must
cross four lanes in short dis-
tance to reach your next objec-

tive, the exit onto the Parkway’

East. Considering the heavy traf-
fic spewing out of the tunnel, -you

I must weave an intricate and dead-

ly ballet to reach your goal.

Woe is he who is not familiar
with the ramps and exits on any of
the main arteries around Pitts-
burg. From the air they must look
like a heap of spaghetti. Any out-

-sider or Pittsburgher can attest to
..the confusing maze these roads

form.

Famous Art Critic Speaks Wed.

While the poor driver is trying
to figure out where he is going, he
must watch out for traffic coming
onto his road from all four direc-
tions; left, right, above, and be-
low. ’

This, plus Pittsburgh’s street-
car tracks. still on streets that

have not seen a streetcar in ,

years, make life hard for the av-
erage driver. These tracks often
become especially dangerous
when hit at high speed during wet

‘or icy weather. They are strategi-

cally placed so that they are hard
to avoid and they refuse to stay
under when paved over.

This expanion of the macro
component of social work will
provide job opportunities in in-
dustry, in labor unions, in law en-
forcement. The policy and plan-
ning thrust will make the demand ‘
for social workers greatest in the
areas of 'mental health, health
services, child services, criminal

. justice, and economic security.

Sites also explains that the re-
turn to a peace time economy will
put the spotlight on domestic
needs, and as the people demand
more services the Congress will

provide programs to meet the
people’s needs.

The Veteran's Administration is
the single largest employer of so-
cial workers. With the return of
the POW’s and the veterans of the
Vietnam war they will undoubted-
ly continue to employ large num-
bers of social workers.

Sites is quick to point" out that
social work “will continue to work
on an individual basis with peo-
ple who hurt, and there will be
people who hurt, for even in a
utopia there will be individuals
who fail to adjust to their en-
vironment.” -

Musical Florci ‘Bloom’

During Chapel Recital

by ANDREW J. SOPKO
Arts Editor

A number of musical bouquets
blossomed recently at the Tues-
day noon organ recital offered by
Dr. Robert S. Lord at Heinz Chap-
el. We say bouquets because, in

’ reality, there were two works on

the program which were entitled
“musical flowers.”

Opening with a portion of Fres-
cobaldi‘s Fiori Musicale, Dr. Lord
provided the Bergamasca, a set
of variations which echos the
sound of rustic Italian dances.
Filled with a balanced sense of
musical proportion, the delivery
was precise and,“clean cut.”

While we haven’t the slightest
idea as to why Frescobaldi called
his particular group of composi-
tions “flowers,” the other floral
piece on the programs had a very
explicit program. Charles Tour-
nemire’s Sei Fioretti was inspired
by the very popular fioretti
(tales) of Saint Francis of Assisi.
Tournemire, a mystic as well as.
one of the leading composers in '
the modern ‘school of French or-
gan music, was quite -a devoted
follower of the Italian saint.

Following a pilgrimage to As-
sisi, Tournemire returned to
France, allowing both his mysti-
cism and his devotion to‘ over-
flow into his musical flora. Im-
bued with a stark musical simpli-
city that the saint would have wel-
comed, the pieces reflect not only
the sanctity of Francis but also
the esoteric nature of Tourne-
mire’ s musical approach.

Three of the composition’s half
dozen .movements were present-
ed. The second piece, inspired by
the story of Francis’ temporary
blindness and the visit of an .an-
gel, vividly recreated the wing-
ed messenger’s’ descent and as-
cent. The final movement was in-

spired by the story, so beautiful-
ly painted in the Church of Assisi,
of the saint’s preaching to the
birds._ Here, just as in the music
of Messiaen, the composition was
filled with bird calls. P

Tournemire’s work is not the
type which is easily grasped by
the listener on "a first hearing.
This listener -was a bit uneasy
during the fioretti —- they are
sometimes almost too sparse in
‘musical content to hold one’s at-
tention; nonetheless, they are im-
bued with an unusual charm. '

Onewell-known work was found
on Tuesday’s program: the St.
Anne Fugue of J. S. Bach. As one
of the staples of the organ reper-
toire, this composition is open to

_wide interpretation. Lord’s ap-
proach was animated and con-
vincing; indeed, this was the best
Bach ‘interpretation we have
heard from him at the Heinz
Chapel console in some time.

Closing out the program were
the Litanies of Jehan Alain. In-
spired by the recurrent penitence

° of the" believer, the composition

ta_kes a ‘syncopated theme and
adds more and _more of the divi-
sions of the instrument until the
work finally concludes in a blaze
of glorious sound.

If only for the Litanies at the
end of the recital, this was
worthwhile program. It ' offered
diversity, exciteméiit, and the op-
portunity. to hear little known
works. Dr. Lord was in especially

fine form, both at the console and _

at the lecturn.

‘His remarks on the program
prior to the performance were
most helpful and very well select-

ed. There can be little doubt that

this series continues to improve,
both in the scope of its outlook and
its education of the devoted lis-
teners.

L. A. Reggae is a complete do-
cument of one of the most uneven
recording careers in recent rock
history. Johnny Rivers started
out doing killer top ten versions
of "Maybelline,” ‘.‘Memphis,”
and “Secret Agent Man,” record-
ed either live at the Whiskey A-
Go-Go in L.A. or a recording stu-
dio resembling such. He was one
of the folks who gave Americans
confidence I that we could rock

But somewhere along the.

65.
line, 01’ Johnny got sidetracked.-
He began turning out slow-dance-
at-the—prom ballads, like Poor
Side of Town. From there he went
on to recording third-rate Jimmy
Webb tunes. I though he was on
the way out oflall this when I
heard his Slim Slo Slider album,
where he tackled some Van Mor-
rison material, including a beau-
tiful interpretation of Van’s “Into
the Mystic” that nearly cut the

original. It didn’t sell much.

Since none of this‘ stuff was ad-
vancing Johnny’s career much, he
must’ve decided that his old style
might make it again, so he dug out
an old Huey Smith and the Clowns
single. from the fifties, called
"Rockin’ Pneumonia and the Boo-
gie Woogie Flue.” He rounded up
bassman Joe Osborne and Bread’s
pianist Larry Knechtaljformerly.
of his old “Memphis” band along
with some other friends, plus Jim
Gordon, drumer from Derek and.
the Dominos, and headed for the
studio. The results are another un-
even Johnny Rivers album, but
one that holds cause for optimism.

. Rockin’ Pneumonia is one ‘of
those “stomp” piano songs that
cause people to turn their car ra-
dios all the way up when it comes
on. It’s followed by the old Eddie
Floyd tune Knock on Wood. ‘I al-
ways‘ thought this song would suf-
fer without horns. Rivers and Co.
replace the horns with guitars and
it sounds just fine. Brown—Eyed

Miss Gish then went into films_
and was so attracted by the new
art form that she made an 18-
year career of it. Her first screen
test was made in 1912- it con-
sisted of running around the stu-
dio with Director D. W. Griffith
firing blank cartridges at her.
Her talents in these films estab-
lished her as one of the first truly
international stars. “Birth of a Na-
tion". “Intolerance”. “Broken
Blossoms", “Orphans of the
Storm", "The Scarlet Letter",
-“White Sister” — -are only a few
of the dozens of films in which
she starred. At the time when ac-
tresses were expected to fall off
cliffs and swim icy rivers. she
became one of the leading ladies

-of the film world.

house. It was the Cat’s last home
meet of the campaign.

“I'd have to say it's the best
match we‘ve wrestled.“ said Coach
Dave Adams. "I can see a lot of
improvement-—Come time for
the Easterns we're going to scare
some people."

The Cats scared a few Penn
State people as George "Fuddy"
Bryant walked out to win his
7th
slamming one Tom Teagarden to
the tune of an 11-2 decision.
Teagarden. who holds 8—how can
it be‘?—wins over Fuddy, must
have felt like a medicine ball.
as Bryant continually picked the
former high school champ off the
mat to bounce him.

The skinny-legged Washington,
Pa. sophomore left little doubt
in the minds of the 1,248 Field-
house fans as to who is the bet-
ter wrestler on this day, while at
the same time he earned sweet
revenge for the 4-3 robbery loss
last year at University Park.

Fuddy took his win calmly;

no gloating over trouncing the-

man who’d beaten him so often.
"I was just as strong as he was,"
Bryant said after it was all over.
"He used to try and muscle ‘me.
but he can‘t anymore." ’

Was he a little rough on his
old high school nemisis?

“Yeah, I think I should have‘

been called for-a slam. I thought
his head shook a couple of times,
so I let up a little. I didn’t want
to hurt-him. ”

‘Dave Adams—and the Field-
house crowd’—found it difficult
to match the 118 pounder’s com-
placency. "You'll never see a
better wrestled match. Bryant
was absolutely great." Adams
enthused. ‘

Bryant’s win put the Cats up.
3-0. but Pitt dropped the next
three matches, two by superior
to fall behind 11-3.
At 126 Don Rother, still looking
for his first win, was manhandled
by undefeated John Fritz.

In the 134 pound class Bob
Medina used two escapes and a
takedown to decision Buzzy
Beck, 35-2. Freshman Ron Self-
ridge looked. sluggish and was
trounced by State’s Barry Sny-
der, who carried an 8-1 record
«into the meet.

John Buzzato, lanky 150 pound
senior eked a 5-4 win over Mike
Mousetis. ~

“He‘s got the guts of a burg-

ler," said Dave Adams.

Buzzato, who at 10-2 is Pitt’s
winningest—and most durable-
grapplerhad to grit his teeth and
wrap those stick legs around the
muscular Mousetis, hanging

there unmoving, for the last thir-

ty seconds of the bout. \

“I knew it would be close."
said the ‘Burgler’ Buzzato. who
always pleases a crowd with his
scrappiness. “I usually try to
punish them a little. but this
time I had to gut it out."

John Chatman pulled the Cats
to within two points of Penn

and aggressive in copping his

Penn State coach Bill Knoll was
mildly impressed with Pitt’s mat-
men. “It’s the most aggressive
team I've seen here,” he said, tak-
ing time from patting his own
team’s back. ‘

I/Koll remained unconvinced
that any Easternlclub could sur-
vive his squad. “I haven’t seen
any one better,” he puffed through
a cigar stump. Pitt is to be‘con-

It On Colonials Tomorrow 

By JANICE BUCCIGROSSI
Associate Sports Editor

The Pitt basketball squad journeys to the nation's
capital this weekend to do battle with the Colon- \
ials of George Washington University. Game-time
is scheduled for 8:00 p.m. tomorrow night.

In the ll) game series between the two teams’
the Panthers have a strong edge. having won sev--
en and lost three.

The last meeting of the Colonialsand the Cats
which was the '71-'72 season found the Pitt cagers

_ on top_ by nine points with the score at 99-81.

_ ' The Colonials‘ have a season record well above
the .500 mark, 14'-5, a feat they were not able to
accomplish over the entire season last year (GW
was 11-14 during the ’71-’72 campaign).

In one of their most recent contests the Col-
onials confronted the West Virginia Mountaineers
and were squeezed out of a victory by the score of
61-60. The Panthers have also currently faced the
Mounties but in that contest WVU was the loser.
dropping the game to the Cats by the lopsided
score of 77-64. '

The most outstanding hoopster for George Wash-
ington is Pat Tallent. a 6-3 sophomore guard from
Langley, Kentucky.

Tallent led the 17-1. freshmen squad last year
in scoring, averaging 26.2 per game. This average
ranked him 29th in the country among the top
freshmen scorers.

In 18 frosh contests Tallent shot 53 per cent
from the floor. '77 per cent from the charity line
and collected an overall 472- points, Tallent scored
in the double figures in every game—he tallied
over 30 points on seven occasions and over 20
points seven times.

Tallent. however. is not a name that George
Washington has just recently been introduced to.
The current Tallent on the GW squad is the
third to play for the Colonials —— brothers Bob
and Mike have gone the route also. At present
brother Bob is the assistant basketball coach at
GW. '

When recruiting Tallent the Colonials’ head
basketball coach Carl Slone» noted, “he’s the best
6-3 player I've seen in high school since Jerry
West.”

So far this season the sophomore hoop star has
again showed that he is the hot shooter on the

Both players left the game,
being charged with flagrant fouls,
but the loss of Kenner’s ability
was made up for by some hot-
shooting by therest of the Flash-
es.

all night,” reasoned Bolla, “and
we don't like anybody on the team
getting pushed around.”

tempts. Knight lead all rebound-
ers, apparently with nine, but
Kent State’s statistics department,
which is as accurate as a two-

wrong in several departments,

game.

Kent State won the contest,

ing was well below par, only
32%. Greg McBride lead all scor-
ers with 20 points, and although
the KSU statisticians would have
you believe he was six for six

  Skaters Face
PSU Enroute
To Tournament

by BART MACK

Thetalk around the league late-
ly concerning the Pitt Hockey
Club has been concerned with
what will happen at the Civic
Arena on Feb. 18. The skaters
will get the first of two “warm-
ups” for the Arena rematch with
C-MU when they meet Penn State
(McKeesport) Sunday at 8 p.m. at
the Alpine Ice Chalet. .

,Any smart hockey coach will
tell you that any team is capable
of beating any other team on any
given night. That" game at the
Arena might loom as number one
in the minds of Pitt players. but
they had better be back out of the
clouds and on the ice when Sunday
rolls around. I ' 5

Last time the two teams met,
Pitt trounced Penn State, 9-2.
Pitt completely dominated that
game and it’s likely the same
thing will occur again. Statistical-
ly, Penn State’s hope for making
a play-off spot is almost non-exis-
tant. Penn State stands at the .500
mark with four wins and four loss-
es for a total of eight points. Pitt
has slipped to second place be-
hind C-MU with an 8-1 record for
16 points.

,C-MU currently posts an 8-0-2
record and will be playing Slip-
pery Rock before Pitt battles PSU
(McKeesport). That means Pitt
will hold two games in hand on the
Tartans going into Sunday night's
contest and the skaters will have
to win to keep pace with Carnegie-
Mellon.

Buses for the game will leave
from ‘the Fifth Ave. side of the
Student Union at 7 :30 p.m. Tick-
ets can be purchased at the Stu-
dent Union ticket office or from

any team member. Attendance at
the last few Pitt contests has been
on the up and it looks like the stu-
dent body has finally begun to
support the icers as the season’
moves into the home stretch.

At a practice session last week

some bad news filled the Pitt lock- 1

er room. Second line center Dave

Bahnson announced that he would

be leaving the team after the
month of February. A third year

medical student, Bahnson will be

leaving for Vermont to assist an

orthopedic specialist. Bahnson is

one of the team’s leading goal pro-

ducers and top penalty killers.

On Wednesday night, Feb. 7,
Pitt will travel to Kittanning and

I the Belmont Arena to take on Slip-

pery Rock. The Rockets are only a
point behind St. Vincents in the
race for second place of the Met-'
ropolitan Division of the Western
Pa. Intercollegiate Hockey Asso-
ciation. In nine games St- Vin-
cents has accumulated only three
points but,-in eight conte_sts, Slip-
pery Rock has only been able to
produce a pair of points.

Getting back to that big game at.
the Arena, Pitt players are taking
the rematch with Carnegie-Mel-
lon with more interest than‘ever
before. The general consensus in
the Pitt locker room is that the
Tartans were “lucky” in "their
victory over the skaters in De-
cember. Although the contest is
only exhibition, Pitt will he look-
ing for revenge.

and second place, and therefore the two play-

Division, Indiana is the top slot with 13 points
and a 6-2-1 record. Now take a look at‘second

St. Vincents is 1-7-1 with three points and presently is in
possession of that second play-off spot of the Metropolitan Di-

' vision. Slippery Rock is right behind them with a 1-7 record.

Still the fact remains that one of these hapless teams will
qualify for a play-off spot, depending on who finishes in second
place. Remember Penn State and Duquesne?

Now the Duquesne hockey team isn’t too popular in the
Pitt locker room or the Pitt News sports office for that matter,
but the fact remains that the play-offs will not feature all of the
top teams of the league. The caliber of play might have improv-

A ed somewhat but there is an obvious difference between the

teams in the two divisions.

A recent press release sent from the WPIHA to the Pitt
News concerning theupcoming West Penn Hockey Tournament
to be held at the Civic Arena had this to say: “The four teams
representing the WPIHA in that tournament are considered the
Best in the league this season.”

Pitt will meet CMU in the opening game on Sunday night,

.« Feb. 18, while Duquesne will battle Indiana in the second con-

test.‘ That’s right, St. Vincent and Slippery Rock are not involved
in the tournament.

Maybe it’s an attempt by WPIHA officials to provide what
should be play-off competition but the tournamentis only exhibi-
tion and doesn’t mean beans when it comes to the fight for the
Commissioners Cup. 1 5

Duquesne and Penn State are obviously victims of circum-

stance. The situation can be compared to the initial years of

expansion in the NHL when the Western Division, composed en-
tirely of expansion teams, was created equal to the established
teams that comprised the Eastern circuit. ’

year and was barely edged by the
East‘s top team, Penn State. 159.30
to 153.70.

The Middies will be led by a po-
tential All-American on the side
horse and a very strong,’ balanced
team. Eric Swanson, who aver-
ages 9.5 out of a possible 10.0. on
the side horse will give Bob Rod-
gers and Lee Lily plenty to think
about in the event.

Dick Pribis, Pitt’s most consis-
tent performer, has a chance to
cop the floor exercise for the Cats
and along with Ed Swerdlow will
compete in the vaulting event.
