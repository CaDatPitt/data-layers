‘g Days

by Hayley Grgurich
Aa4[4tantNewa E3itor I

Dogs from all over Pittsburgh
brought their people out to play Satur-
day afternoon for the ﬁrst “Dog Days
of Summer” event at the Waterfront

The ﬁrst of three events of its
kind, Dog Days of Summer featured
tents sponsored by area vendors, dog-
themed games and prizes, araﬂle and
a cover band performing everything
ﬁom Genesis to Coldplay.

Kelli Gaghan, marketing coor-
dinator.for the Waterfront, said the
inspiration for Dog Days came from
the city’s St. Patrick’s Day parade,

-where she saw a group ﬁom Paws

with a Cause, an organization that
trains dogs to assist people ‘with dis-
abilities, march

“I thought it was a great thing that
they were doing, and I wanted to see
if we could organize something at the
Waterfront to beneﬁt their organiza-
tion,” said Gaghan.

Gaghan pitched the idea, and the
resounding response from businesses
in the Waterfront was “yes,” some-
thing could be done, and Dog Days
was adopted The close ties between
Pawswith a Cause and the Western
Pemisylvania Humane Society made
it only natural that "both groups be-
come involved, said Gaghan.

“It’s a a two-way g ,” said
Gaghan. “I really want to bring peo-
ple out to the Waterfront this summer
and to raise $5,000 for Paws with a
Cause and the Humane Society in
three events.”

Pittsburgh’s “Most Livable”
rating recently suffered the addi-
tion of a black smudge. ,

Aside from livability, the city

also topped the list for smoggiest p

this year when it was named the
worst U.S. city for particle pollu-

tion by the American Lung Asso— _

ciation.

To clean up its image Pitts-
burgh is at work to improve its air
quality. But according to the Al-
legheny County Health Depart-
ment, things aren’t as bad as they
seem.

“We don’t disagree with the

fact that the air quality in the ‘

Liberty—Clairton region does not
meet Environmental Protection
Agency standards, but the report
isn’t a fair representation of the
air quality in the Pittsburgh re-
gion as a whole,” said department
spokesman Guillermo Cole.

The May 2008 “State of the
Air” report, an armual publication
by the association, polls cities in
three key areas: ozone, year—round
and short—term particle pollution.
The report found Pittsburgh to
have the worst short-terrn particle
pollution in the country and the
second worst -—— trailing Los An-

It was so easy, even a mon-
key could do it.

With more doctors and scien-
tists developing riew, innovative
technology, an ordinary person
might believe the possibility of
creating movie-like super pow-
ers could lie directly beneath his
or her ﬁngertips. A

In fact, for the past four
years, University of Pittsburgh
Medical Center
have been working on a project
that involves one well—known
super power: controlling one’s
environment with the mind.

This became the case when
the researchers decided to teach

 

researchers V

a rhesus monkey to use a robot-
ic arm to feed itself by simply
thinking about the action.
Andrew Schwartz, the prin-
cipal investigator of this project
and a neurobiology professor at
Pitt, said he has worked as a sci-
entist interested in the cortical
control of arms for close to 25
years and decided to do a spin-
off of the basic research effort.
“We started in the early 1990s
at Arizona State University in
the bioengineering program.
Our initial funding came from
the Whitaker Foundation. We
then began a string of contracts
and grants from [the National
Institutes of Health], speciﬁ-
cally from the Neural Prosthesis
Program,” said Schwartz.

ew Plasrna(§are customer,
illreceive up to $130 for
 rpfirst four donations.

From there, Schwartz and his

team worked together on the pi— ..

lot project to show that it is pos-
sible to control a prosthetic arm
using brain activity.

Meel Velliste, a research as-

sistant professor at Pitt’s School

of Medicine, observed the mon-
key’s movements.

“The monkey can control the
arm to move in arbitrary posi-
tions and can ‘open and close the
gripper on the arm,” said Vel-
liste. . A
Because of its high precision

and controllability,
. said researchers are using a com-
mercially available robot arm
made for research purposes. _
“The joints are also ‘back-
drivable,’ meaning that they will

Schwartz 1

yield when pushed against. This

allows us to build in a springi- '

ness to the arm that makes it feel
alive and helps us to generate
movements that seem natural,”
Schwartz added.

Aaron Batista, an assistant

professor of bioengineering at
Pitt’s Swanson-School of Engi-
neering, said that human beings
are already being helped by neu-

ral prostheses like the one Dr.

Schwartz is developing.

“Dr. Schwartz and his stu-
dents have enabled monkeys to
control a robotic arm moving
in three dimensions,” he said.
.“This device, given to a patient,
would give them a degree of in-

. dependence.”

Velliste also agreed that the

project could be applied to hu-
mans in the future.

“With quadriplegic patients
with no ability to move, we
could record brain signals to
restore the ability to manipulate
their surrounding environment,”
he said.

“We are extending this work
to the operation of a wrist and
hand,” said Schwartz. “In the
future, we would like patients to
be able to carry out the natural
hand movements needed to be

self—sufﬁcient in daily activi-

ties.
Batista acknowledged that it

will be years before neural pros-.

thetics will become a truly fea-
sible option for individuals with
motor impairments.

Change is in the air for smoggy part of Pittsburgh

Air, page 1
geles — in year—round particle pollution.

Some ofﬁcials have criticized the report
for what they say is an apparent ﬂaw: Pitts-
burgh pollution data was gathered from
only one monitoring site, the Liberty—Clair—
ton site. That site is in the vicinity of one of
the largest polluters in the region, Clairton
Coke Works.

The poll did use, however, the highest-
recorded monitoring site in all cities across
the country, according to the association.

In the wake of the association’s report,
Pittsburgh has submitted a plan to the EPA
to ensure all monitoring sites in the county
reach federal standards for particle pollu-
tion.

“Most of the monitoring sites are meet-
ing air pollution standards. And we have a
plan to bring the rest of Allegheny County
into standards of ﬁne particle pollution by
2010,” said Cole.

“We have Liberty-Clairton by 2015 be-
cause U.S. Steel’s Clairton Coke Works is
in the process of replacing their coke—oven
batteries,” he said.

According to the report, particle pol-
lution “refers to a mix of very tiny solid
and liquid particles that are in the air we
breathe.” These small particles can pen-

etrate human lung tissues and cause health
problems.

In hard numbers, the air pollution prob-
lem in Pittsburgh seems to be conﬁned to
certain areas.

The,air that Lawrence\ Elle and Oakland
folks breathe is cleaner tl law. the air Liberty-
Claiiton folks breathe.

From 2005 to 2007, the Lawrenceville
monitoring site has annually been within
0.1 grams per cubic meter of a federal
PM2.5 standard of 15.0 grams per cubic

meter, whereas the Liberty—Clairton moni-
toring site has been off by approximately
4.08 grams per cubic meter for that same
time period.

With the projected coke—oven battery
replacements in U.S. Steel’s Clairton Coke
Works plant, Cole said he expects ﬁne par-
ticle pollution to decrease. This was the
case when an LTV coke plant in Oakland
closed a few years ago, improving the air
quality in the neighborhood, said Cole.

ALA’s Mid-Atlantic branch, said that the
city’s particular rank is not as important as
the fact that a problem exists.

“Even if you took away that particular
monitoring site [in Liberty-Clairton], Pitts-
burgh’s air would still be 15th or 16th worst
in the country,” she said. “So either way
you look at it, there is a pollution problem
in that area. The ALA isn’t trying to penal-

we’re educating people about the issue.”

SGB: Despite few summer payouts, extra fee necessary

Alliance, Interfraternity Council, Panhel-
lenic Association, Nursing Student Council,
the National Panhellenic Council and Resi-
dent Student Association.

When the summer sessions end on Aug.
2, the money students have spent on the
additional student activities fee included
in their summer tuition will roll into nex
year’s budget, said Handler. ' '

The allocations committee is in charge
of money gathered from the student activi-
ties fee, creating budgets for student groups
and granting them supplemental requests
for $500 or less. SGB votes on requests for
more than $500.

The student activities fees gathered dur-
ing fall, spring and summer usually amount
to about $2.3 million for the year.

Students taking 12 or more credits dur-
ing summer sessions pay $14 for the under-
graduate activities fee, and students taking
less than 12 credits pay $7, said Terrence
Milani, a Student Life administrator.

In the past academic year, the student
activities fee was $80 per semester for full-
time students and $24 a semester for part-
time students.

During the summer, that fee is reduced
because there are fewer activities and stu-

dents to partake in them.

While the full enrollment of students this
summer is yet to be determined, last sum-
mer 4,983 students took summer classes,
said Alyssa Slazinski, an infomiation spe-
cialist from Pitt’s Department of Institu-
tional Research. Of these, 843 students were
enrolled full time, and 4,140 were enrolled
part time.

This means that the undergraduate activ-
ities fee will raise $40,782 if this summer’s
enrollments‘ match last year’s.

But if supplemental requests remain in-
frequent, most of this money will roll into
next year’s budget.

Handler said most groups spend the
summer planning for the fall semester rather
than hosting activities.

“They’re not going to have a program in
the summer when students a1en’t aroun ,”
said Handler.

Handler said she does not see a problem
in the fact that students still pay an activities
fee in the summer.

“That money is available in the summer.
That way if things come up, [student groups]
can request for them,” said Handler.

Fonner allocations committee member

Rhajiv Ratnatunga agreed.

“It’s one of those standard fees you just
have to pay. It’s a pretty small fee . .. You’re
a Pitt student, you’re going to have to pay
it.

“No one’s going to voluntarily pay mon-
ey for student activities. Whoever wants to
participate will participate.”

Smoking is butted out

Pa. Senate passes long-overdue state smoking ban

After being tabled for more
than a year, scraping through
the Pennsylvania House of
Representatives and failing
to make it through the state
Senate on its first try, a ban

, on smoking in indoor public
f places has finally been passed

by

the Pennsylvania state

_ legislature. Gov. Ed Rendell

has already pledged to sign

 the bill into law, ‘and it is set
A to make sweeping changes
3 across the state.

But for all its significance,
the smoking ban doesn’t re-

 ally do a whole lot. There are
1 numerous exceptions named

in the bill, such as bars where
food sales account for less

 than 20 percent of revenue, up
 to 50 percent of casino ﬂoors

except in Philadelphia,

 where smoking is already
 banned more comprehensive-
 ly — and designated outdoor
 smoking areas, among others.

In many ways, it seems like

I the state legislature is simply
Q trying to placate both sides
A of the debate by employing a
 bill that does little to change
’ the existing order except in a
 few outstanding cases. Most
_ bars won’t be affected by the
f new rules, but the increas-

ingly scarce smoking sections
in restaurants are now set to

\; disappear. The small number
 of workplaces that don’t have
 indoor smoking bans in place
' already might be in for a

7 shakeup, but the clear major-

? ity, where smoking is already
I banned inside, won’t feel a

thing.
The bill is just as much a
statement of purpose as it is
I an actual attempt to curb pub-
I lie smoking. Of course it will
 have some legal weight once
i signed into law, but it also
places Pennsylvania firmly
among the roughly 35 other
1 states that have a legal smok-
 ing ban. Perhaps we’re simply

jumping on the bandwagon,

"even if the bandwagon hap-

pens to be good for public
health.

And as good as the bill is
for people who don’t want

to be bothered by tobacco 
smoke, it’s equally as badf
for the people who choose to 
enjoy it. There are some defi— 
nite civil liberties issues at 3

work in the underpinnings of
this bill, but for the most part
the exceptions seem to cover
them neatly. In the few places
where they don’t, such as res-
taurants that may have previ-
ously had smoking sections,
there are bound to be incon-
veniences and some grumpy
smokers.

There’s also issues with’
banning smoking in the in-
terest of public well—being
while at the same time allow-

ing infinitely more grievous 

affronts to public heath con-
tinue unabated or with only
minimal oversight. One could
certainly argue that choking
down a blast of hot exhaust
fumes from a passing truck or
bus is just as bad for you as
second-hand smoke, and ban-
ning the one over the other
isn’t exactly fair.

For the most part, the
smoking ban is a step forward
for-Pennsylvania. Despite its
shortcomings, the ban shows
a marked effort at improving

-the quality of living for the

majority of people in the state,
as well as placing Pennsylva-
nia among other progressive
states and countries that have
already taken similar mea-
sures. It would certainly be
nice if the state continued to

pass l'IlOI'C stringent IIICZISUICS I

for improving air quality and
concerned itself more with
public health, but the smok-
ing ban as it stands now is
certainly a move in the right
direction.

Clinging to the candidacy  

Why did Hillary Clinton stay in the racefor so long?

by Cassidy Gruber
Cola/n_mIdt

A sigh of relief seemed to per-

meate the country on Wednesday
morning as it was made apparent
that the exceedingly long carn-
paign for the Democratic nomi-
nation had ﬁnally reached its end.
The race felt as though it had lasted

forever, not only drawing itself out '

into the ﬁnal moments of the pri-
maries but also having begun so

early, the candidates lining up just _

as Bush was sworn into ofﬁce for
his second term.

And part _of what made the
race seem even longer was that it
endured such a menagerie of role-
changers, candidates who were at
one moment the ‘frontrunner, the
next the underdog. It was fought
bitterly and ultimately won in the
places we forget so easily, like
Kentucky and Montana — states
that can often seem like the cultural
deserts of ourcountiy for the other
three years of the election cycle,
alien and elusive to the America
that propagates itself in the media.

And now the historical signiﬁ-
cance of thegeneral election has
been set. It has become a question
of progress vs. tradition, outwardly
a battle between change and con-

 
   

sistency, underlyingly a battle of
breaking through the race banier.
And while it certainly is important
to consider and examine the impli-
cations of the election results before
we vote, those questions are likely
to overshadow the implications
of the decisions that have already
been made in these campaigns.
For example: Hillary Clinton’s
decision to remain in the race, even
when it seemed obvious that she
had lost. When my roommate — a
diehard Clinton supporter — re-
turned from her campaign work in
Indiana, she seemed resigned to an
Obama—McCain race. And yet, al-
most a month passed between then
and the end of Clinton’s campaign.
In between, the senator was ridi-
culed for being foolish, stubborn
and divisive, for clinging doggedly
to a plane—on—ﬁre idea of presiden-
cy when everyone else had seemed

, t0 IIIOVC on.

Why? Some argue that it was
mere intractability that kept her in
it, that she was tethered to the cam-
paign by a sense of entitlement that
stemmed from her long political ca-
reer. But if this were true, wouldn’t
she have dropped out earlier when
she could have saved her pride and
maybe also maintained the politi-
cal relationships that would have

cast her as a cabinet member or
maybe even vice president?

Others say, that it was party
strengthening in which she was in-
terested, that her campaign inspired
organization and action by the par-
ty in places that normally would
have remained apathetic. But her
campaign was also incontestably
polarizing and contributed to the
clownishness of the Democratic
Party during this race, possibly do-
ing more harm than good.

So if it was not egoist or inciter
that Clinton played, what was it?

In her concession speech, Clin-
ton made a point to be supportive
and positive about the future of
Obama’s campaign. This was a
good choice on her part, to pres-
ent herself as someone who is for
the party and for- the country, even
when it was not for her. But as well
as displaying a graceful lack of
petulance, Clinton also made a few
comments about gender that could
not only give meaning to her cam-
paign but also justify her decision
to stay in ﬂie race so long. Clin-
ton said that it is a “remarkable”
movement for our society that it
will now be “unremarkable” for a
woman to achieve the political ac-
complishments that she did, that
the precedent was set, and ‘similar

Yesterday, today, tomorrow: Bobby Kennedy and Barack Obama

by Shane 
Colunuziat

On June 5, 1968, Robert F.
Kennedy, brother of President
John F. Kennedy and Sen. Ted
Kennedy, was assassinated in Los
Angeles during his campaign for
the presidency.

On June 3, 2008, some 40 years
after the assassination of Robert
“Bobby” Kennedy, Sen‘. Barack

. Obama claimed the Democratic

Party’s. nomination to run for the
president of the United States in
N ovember’s election.

Despite running for the presi-
dent of the United States decades
apart from each other, the tales of
Kennedy and Obama are inter-
twined not just by party but by
their political character and by the
inﬂuence that each has had on the
‘United States of America.

During Bobby Kennedy’s cam-

_ paign for the presidency  1968,
_ Kennedy generated almost unpar-

alleled amounts of enthusiasm,
comparable to the overwhelming
adoration and support amassed by

Clinton and the future of women’s

success.

The question persists, though,
whether it really will be easier for
women now that Clinton has tried
and failed.

ton has become the paramount

symbol for women’s achievement,

will it be easier for those whose
gender bias «affects a woman’s role
to assume that their prejudice will

— go uimoticed? By saying that we

have made great strides in gender
equality with this campaign, are

his older brother's during his brief

V presidency.

In his armouncement for his
intention to run for the presiden-
cy, Kennedy maintained that he
was running to “close the gaps
that now exist between white and
black, between‘ rich and poor,
between young and old.” Much
like the widespread support that
Obama imaintains, Kennedy’s
popularity sparmed across racial,
ethnic, social and . generational
boundaries. ' .

Throughout the 19603, Ken-
nedy was an incredible champion
for civil rights. As attorney gener-
al of the United States, Kennedy
was the lead prosecutor against

‘ numerous corrupt, Southern of-

ﬁcialsi and was one of the most
signiﬁcant players in the desegre-
gation of the United States.

During his ‘time as attorney .

general under John F. Kennedy’s
administration, ’many of the civil

rights initiatives that were passed V

Wﬂl we no longer be held account-
able for our bigotry toward women
because we’ve allowed one single

in danger of being able to hold up

Ifit is the case that Hillary Clin-

giowth with one hand while quiet-
ly undermining all of our progress
so far with the other. It’s-our job, as
a society thatwill be overwhelmed
with different questions of . social
justice for the next few months, to

ensure that this does not happen. _ c

When history looks back on
this election, it will read Hillary

States.

Additionally, Bobby Kennedy
was one of the noteworthy con-
tributors to arguably the most sig-
niﬁcant legislation passed in mod-
em American history: the Civil
Rights Act, which effectively out-
lawed segregation in ' schools,
public places and employment.

Obama, who is the ﬁrst black
person to have attained the noun-
nation for the president of the
United States for either major po-
litical party, would not be in such
a situation if not for Kennedy.‘

The foundation that Kennedy
had laid for the civil rights move-
ment in the 1960s and the ground-
breaking legislations in which he
was a key ﬁgure in developing en-
abled black people the opportuni-
ty for social mobility and welfare
that was previously unattainable.
Ultimately, the momentous work
that Kennedy did for civil rights
has resulted in one of the most
remarkable accomplishments in
U.S. history: a black person on the
cusp of attaining the highest po-
litical ofﬁce in the United States.

Clinton as someone who was not a
candidate for president, but a wom-
an for president. And though her
candidacy might have failed now,

it is still yet to be written whether

or not her eiforts as a- woman for
president were futile.

And I think that that question‘

now at our hands, which could eas-
ily be ignored in the fervor of the
general election’s social impact, is
insurmountably important

E-mail Cassidy at cassidygru-
ber@grm1il.com.

Aside from the direct relation-
ship between the landmark leg-

islations of Kennedy’s political

career and Obama’_s unprecedent-
ed ascension to the democratic
nomination for the presidency,
both share similar political foun-
dations.

Much like 2008, 1968 was a
year in which the United States
was entrenched in a seemingly
endless war, as well as social and
economic inequality. Accordingly,
Kennedy founded his presidential
campaign on a strangely familiar
word: change. .

Like Obama, Kennedy was
committed to ending a war that
was widely considered a_ failure

and executing innovative national»

policies aimed at promoting so-
cial and economic equality and
welfare.

Kennedy ’s campaign was

based entirely on making signiﬁ-
cant progress in the United States
and continuing the steps forward
I that the nation had made under his
older brother,’s administration.

It is not a coincidence . that

Obama has frequently cited John
F. Kennedy in speeches over the
course of his political campaign.

Like Bobby Kennedy, Obama has .

committed to “changing” the po-
litical culture of the United States,
ending a war that is seemingly
endless, improving the quality
of schools, creating more afford-
able health care and offering new
economic opportunities to Ameri-
cans.‘ P .
Ultimately, however, Bobby
Kennedy’s assassination on the
verge of his acceptance of the
Democratic Party’s nomination
left the United States with one
unfortunate question: What might
have been? If Barack Obama man-
ages to lose the 2008 presidential
election in a year where all the
stars are aligned for a Democratic
candidate to regain - the White
' House, it seems that Kennedy and
Obama will share that question as
well.

er’s classic novel,
‘The Color Purple,” to life onstage
this month. The musical won the
Tony for “Best Musical” on Broad-
way, and the show produced by
Oprah Wmfrey continues to impress
audiences in its Pittsburgh perfor-
manoes.

The Pulitzer Prize-winning novel
was adapted into a critically ac-
claimed movie directed by Steven
Spielberg in 1985, and the recent
musical production that hit Broad-
way in 2005 lacks none of the book
and ﬁlm’s drama and power.

Vifrth a talented cast, fantastic
scenery and great musical numbers
paired with Walker’s moving and
beautiﬁrl story, ‘The Color Purple”
is a sure winner that, unlike most

 

musicals, is able to keep its audience
captivated for the full two and a half
hours.

Walker’s story of the struggles of
black women in the South and the
obstacles and abuse they faced, as
well as their various ways of coping
or ﬁghting their oppressors, is acted
out beautifully on the Benedum
Center’s stage.

The musical aspect doesn’t take
away from power and intensity of
Celie’s traumatic but beautiful sto-
ry. In fact, by the end of the last act
many people in the audience were
shamelessly and openly crying.

The cast of “The Color Purple” is
dually talented in its acting and sing-
ing. Jeannette Bayardell, who plays
the main character Celie, performs
the role of a meek, submissive and
victimized girl who transforms into

_ an outspoken and strong old woman

with grace and skill. Her background
as a gospel recording artist is evident
inher strong and soulful voice. .

But Bayardell isn’t the only out-
standing character in this gifted cast.
Felicia P. Fields steals the show play-
ing her role as Soﬁa. Her headstrong
character brightens up the stage and

‘Daily Show’ alum

"Bust," page 10

at the prison. While not being able to grasp the
layout or the logistics of a buzzer, she seems
less than street smart. Her struggle in withhold-
ing personal infonnation during heart-to—hearts
with a needy Native American prostitute makes
them instant ﬁiends.

While Lauren’s impersonations of people
seem rather embellished for theatrical pur-
poses, the scenes in the prison are believable
and play on the cliche that outsiders fear. Irene,
the gutsy change—the—world volunteer, brings
them all goody bags and perceives their work
as necessary and courageous, while the less-
than—intelligent security guard watches “Cops”
while complimenting Lauren’s looks.

In addition to Lauren’s volunteer work, a
bothersome “Glamour” magazine editor asks

her to write a happy hour confessional tale in

print, which leads to the magazine’s own twist.
The “Glamour” version ‘of the  sparks a
plethora of angry message board posts‘ about
the monster she truly is. * . «

This underlying subplot in pink light and
suave elevator music illuminate the hair-twir -

ing, bubbly “Glamour” editor, which plays on 7
another outlandish cliche that Lauren suggests

may be painfully true.
Such a wild show would call for an expe—

.rienced writer and performer, and Weedman

has an impressive resume. Her debut in 2001
on Jon Stewart’s “The Daily Show” as a fea-
tured correspondent happened at the same time

she was a regular on NPR’s national political
satire show, “Rewind.” She studied, wrote and
performed in Amsterdam for ﬁve years and
has completed several plays since in addition
to .“Bust,’7 including a book published last year
called “AWoman Trapped in aWoman’s Body"
(Tales from a Life of Cringe).”

Lauren’s ﬂawless ability to intenuptaspeech
with another character’s voice is cause for the
audience’s closest attention. Laugh—out-loud
humor, impeccable timing and scene changes
mark Weedman’s work An adrenalinedriven
performance coupled with clever writing keep
audiences wide—eyed and wanting more of the
off-kilter charactersshe encounters, let alone
the solo star herself.

A one-woman play might sound daunting,
but with exceptional character development
and presence on the stage, Lauren wears many
hats with success.

Not necessarily a play for the PG crowd,
Lauren’s adult humor, portrayal of prison life
and play with strong personalities keep a steady
roar of gasps and laughter, between a few seri-
ous, thought-provoking moments. By showing
how ridiculous prison wi__s, she also shows how
her work makes life outside prison seem rather
ﬁckle. Her counseling sessions, the pinnacle
of her own life converging with the problem-
infested inmates, show the connections she be-
gins to make and the parasitic relationships she
starts to rely on for meaning in her life.

Surprisingly, the cast occasionally breaking
into song and dance doesn’t take a toll on the
impact and strength of the play. The soulﬁrl and
heart—wrenching songs sung by Celie only irn—
prove the mood of the scene.

Though some of the musical numbers are A

upbeat and “Oklahoma”—esque, like the cos-

tumesandthescenery, allthe songsareihfused
with the styles of the time periods, starting with
the gospel numbers and long, conservative
dresses and suits of 1909 in Celie’s childhood.

The play progresses through the ’20s, ’30s and _

’40s, changing its music and fashion accord-
ingly arrd giving the audience a better feel for
the span of Celie’s lifetime.

. The impressive scenery captures the es-
sence of a rural Georgiatown with colored
‘skies as well as shabby log cabins and the for-

ests of Africa. The furniture, trees and buildings A

are smoothly moved on and oif stage through
the scenes without having any negative impact
on the scene.

. Overall, ‘The Color Purple” is a visual,
musical and emotional triumph with a fantastic
cast and is, beyond a doubt, worth your time
to see.

that Maurice Williams, a sopho-

2008 season after being ruled
academically ineligible.

Williams, who caught 10 balls-*
for 100 yards and a touchdown
last season, had a strong spring

role. Williams led all receivers
during Pitt’s annual spring game
with seven catches for 105 yards“
and a touchdown.

“We’re disappointed for Mau-

is a major priority for our pro-

our expectation is for him to use
this as motivation for improve-
ment.” .

Williams is expected to red—"'i

‘Dream ends for young Pens, look to next year

Detroit Red Wings’ Nicklas Lidstrom lifts the Stanley Cup after
Winning Game 6 against the Pittsburgh Penguins last Wednesday.

cf" Jay

Despite ﬁghting to the ﬁnal min-
ute, the Pittsburgh Penguins failed
in their attempt to bring the Stanley
Cupbacktoﬂrecityfortheﬁrsttime

       
 

since 1992, losing Game 6 of the ﬁ--

nals to the Detroit Red Wings, 3-2.

Even within the friendly conﬁnes
of the Mellon Arena, the Penguins
fell behind 2-0 to Detroit before Ev-
geni Malkin notched his ﬁrst goal of
the series. Detroit added another goal
early in the third period

Marian Hossa scored late in the I

thirdperiodtobringthedeﬁcitto

' one, but last-ditch elforts by Sidney

Crosby and Hossa to tie the game in
the waning seconds were squelched
by Red Wrng goalie Chris Osgood.

Detroit won the series, 4-2. For
the ﬁnal time this season, our Pen-
guins experts tackle all the ques-
tions.

-What was the single most impor-
tant failure for the Penguins in
Game 6?

Jay Huerbin: The Penguins were
not able to capitalize on their chanc-
es when they needed to. All through
that game, I had ﬂashbacks of when
Petr Sykora missed a golden oppor-
tunity in the opening minutes. The
players were into the game, the fans
were into the game, and momentum
was with the Penguins. A goal by
Sykora there would have "lifted ﬂue
roof off of Mellon Arena

Nick LaMantia: Throughout the"

entire series, including Game 6, the
Penguins failed to generate enough
quality scoring chances on Osgood
At times they triedto make the pretty
too often, which led to turnovers and
Detroit scoring chances.

-Which Penguin impressed you
the most in the series?

JH: Brooks Orpik, whose sol-
id season earned him some top min-
utes, had a phenomenal playoff run,
and he really shined in the ﬁnals. He
was a physical force. I dare you to go
back and watch highlights of_ Game
3 and not get goosebumps when Or-
pik dishes out four checks in 15 sec-
onds. He raised his game to another

level this year, and we can only hope
general manager Ray Shero can sign
him this offseason.
NL: The play of Adam Hall
surprised me. He came out of no-
where to contribute some important
goals during the series, which is

. what you need from your grinders in
a long playoﬁ 

-Hossa, Orpik and Ryan Malone
are free agents, while Malkin,
Marc-Andre Fleury and Jordan
Staal might demand extensions.
What should the Pens do entering
next year?

JH: The simple answer would
be to sign them all. We’ll soon ﬁnd

out how feasible that is. Hossa has —

already said he was happy that Shero
got him to Pittsburgh and would be
willing to take less money to stay on
a good 
Both Orpik’s and Malone’s stock
soaredhigh this year, and each could
easily ask for a big raise. It’s all go-
ing to come down to whether or not
these players will take that home-
town discount (Malone especially).

became a member of the Harlem Globetrotters

AntiguawashiredbyPittasthedirectorof
basketballoperalionsin2003 andprornotedtoas-
sistant coach in 2006.

Antigua is joining former Pitt assistant coach
John Calipmi at Memphis. The Tigers were the
nalional nmner-up this past season.

At the end of April, Dixon promoted assistant
coach Tom Herrion to associate head coach

Hossa top
priority for

Penguins

Powerplay, page 14

about how it’s possible to keep most of the team
together next season.

Crosby set a bar last offseason to keep the

players together. Wﬂl his teammates follow in
his footsteps?
NL: Priority No.1 should be resigning Fl-
eury before July 1 to ensure nobody offers him
a tender. Next in line is deciding between Hossa
and Malone.

Malone brings some intangibles that you
rarely see, but someone will deﬁnitely overpay

. for a power forward such as him

Hossa has stated that he is willing to take
less money to play on a good team, so here’s to
hoping. Malkin will be extended this offseason,
but I would expect Staal’s camp to wait until
next year after Staal’s down regular season.

As for Orpik, he could command upward
of $3 million per season, putting him out of the
Penguins’ budget

-Should coach Michel Therrien’s contract
be extended as well? V
JH: He still has another season left under
his current contract,'but even after two and half
seasons, I can’t seem to ﬁgure Thenien out He
juggled his lines so much in the 200607 season
that you never knew who was playing where.
He settled things downthis past season, and it
showed when lines like the Malone-Ma]kin—
Sykora one dominated Now I just need to
ﬁgure out ifthis team is successful because of
the coach, the players or a little bit of both. But
whatever it is, it’s working, and don’t ﬁx what
isn’t broken. Extend his contract.

NL: Thern'en’s contract is up next season,
and with the team’s rapid improvement during
his tenure and .his close connection with the
players, they should offer him two more years

_ after next.
