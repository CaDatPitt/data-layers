Company K5 of the University _Pershing Riﬂes placed
-highest of all‘ Pershing Riﬂe teams in the country and won-
the ﬁfth place overall trophy award in the National ‘Cherry

Blossom Festival Drill’Meet in Washington, D; C.

_ This is the third consecutive year that the» University

PR’shave been among the top ﬁve teams in the nation.

Units, chosen A by a National‘

Commitee to represent their states
and regions’ included Pershing
Riﬂe teams, Army and Air Force
ROTC teams and independent
drill units. Following their victory
in the New York and Pennsylva-
nia regional Drill Competition,

the University Pershing Riﬂesl

were selected as one of the 13 US
Regional teams to enter the meet.
The University Pershing Riﬂes
were chartered in .1951. Their
purpose, according to the PR
founder, General Pershing, is
“to foster a spirit of coopera-
tion in the military department
and to maintain a- highly eﬂiin
cient drill team.”

In 1959 they captured second
place in the ‘National Cherry
Blossom Festival Drill anda first
battalion award. The 17 member
trick drill team journeyed in
1960 to the University of Illinois
where they took fourth place.

In 1961 they went to Gannon
College in Erie where they won
ﬁrst place, and to Pratt Insti-
tute in Brooklyn where they
were awarded another first
place.

Also in 1960 they won a ﬁrst
battalion award here at the Uni-
versity.

The Pershing Riﬂes will travel
to Harrisburg next Saturday to
compete in the Fifth Regional
Drill Meet and on May 12 they

will sponsor a dinner dance.

Police Issue Warning

Cf Theft Rate Increase

Captain Ray Advises Students,
Faculty to Watch Valuables C

_By MARILYN ASHKENAS
Captain Charles Ray of the University Police has is-
sued a warning “which should be taken seriously by stu-
dents and faculty members alike.”

An increasing number of thefts has been occurring on
campus in recent months. Capt. Ray advises all University
personnel toheed this warning: “Always lock purses and

wallets in a cabinet and never!‘

leave valuables in
open.” _

“One case revealed that a sec,-.
retary’s purse was stolen while
she ‘just stepped next door to ask
a question’.

Think Twice

“Think twice about the suspic-
ious stranger loitering. about the
campus for no apparent reason,
unidentiﬁed persons you ’have
seen. before’, and the unknown
person stopping to ask an obvious
question, direction, or bit of in-
formation,” said Capt. Ray.

“This is the opportunity a
thief wants to commit an in- .
tended larceny.” ’

Numerous thefts have occurred
on campus in addition: to the
widely-publicized Picasso inci-
dent. Articles of ‘clothing have
been taken from automobiles,
purses swiped from office desks,
and a few weeks ago, 14 wallets
were stolen from the Commons
Room in a period of 10 days.

Security Not Guaranteed

The Police Department urges
all students and University per-
sonnel to pay particular attention
to small details such as the gen-
eral appearance, race, height,
beard, or speech defects' of_ a sus-
pect. ' >

“As yet, we haven't received
any complaints but these were
not our aims in sending out the
warnings,” said Capt. Ray.
“Our main purpose was to make
faculty and students aware that
the security of belongings is not
to be taken for granted.”

Information concerning thefts
or suspicious persons should. be
forwarded. immediately to the po-
lice office, G-58 Cl.

‘Saturday Review’
Editor Proffers

Views on Policy
at PAT cHERKIN'

In order to make this
planet ﬁt for human habita-
tion, we must have a work-
ing knowledge about the rest
of the world. Norman Cousins
emphasized the A m e r i c a n

shortage of knowledge, as he real-
istically presented the dilemma of
“The War Against Man” to the
Midday Series audience last week.

Cousins, editor of “The Satur-
day Review,” is a foremost ﬁgure
in working ’ for disarmament
throughout the World Federalists
and the National Committee for a
SANE Nuclear Policy. .

Speaking on today’s world sit-
uation, particul.arly in Laos, Cous-
ins said that the Unite_d States
violated the spirit of the Geneva
Treaty. and therefore is respon-
sible for the suitation we now
have.

Explains Crisis

“The United Statesiﬂnanced a
civil war," Cousins said. He ex-
plained the Laos crisis, noting
that last summer the government
in Laos was neutral and even in-
clined toward the U. S. This was
the condition under Souvanna
Phouma. “Then,” said Cousins,
“General Phoumi Nosavan ap-
proached the United States with
plans to overthrow Souvanna and
give us an all pro-West govern-
ment.

The United States solved this

problem by supporting both
sides, and found itself in the
incredible position of underrat-
ing a civil war. We payed no
one for ten days, then resumed
payments and went to Phoumi's
side rather than to the legiti-
mate government of Souvanna.”

Cousins continued his summary
of the Laotian crisis, explaining
that Souvanna approached the
United States and said that if we
persisted in ﬁnancing Phoumi, he
would go outside for help from
the Soviet Union to avoid being
overthrown. Souvanna carried out
his plans.

Predicts Future

Predicting the future in Laos,
Cousins said, “Once again we will
have a country divided. All of it
(Laos) was free and neutral last
year but that wasn’t good enough
for us. We are ﬁghting Commu-
nism without knowledge.”

The speaker asserted that all
of the old approaches are obso-
lete. “The United States has
enough forceto destroy the So- ‘
viet Union 20 times. Does any-
onerfeel secure?” 1.: asked. He
added that there are ten tons of
TNT for every human being in
the world, implying that this
cannot assure security.

“The entire world is now a
single geographical unit and yet
we have no single institution that
meets the problem of world an-
Cousins stated, adding
that government by itself cannot
do the job because of its false
assumptions.

U.N. Not Effective

Cousins explained that he is
thankful for the United Nations,
but said that “it has been forced
to run after history with a mop.”

The United Nations in its
present construction cannot be
effective, according to Cousins.
Because there is now no world
law. he said, “I can think of no
more primitive age than our
own.” '

 Cousins Stresses Need of Learning

act, saying, “it is late, but never
too late. There is yet time and
that time is now.” He said that
we must struggle to gain every
bit of information we can, and
that the individual must recognize
that he had to accept responsibil-
ity for what is happening and to
make things right. “We cannot
assume that the government can
do it by itself,” he emphasized.
Urges Foreign Aid

Continuing Cousins suggested
that the American people create a
consensus in favor of a United
Nations with “effective powers to
deal with crisis.” We must come
before the United Nation-s, he
said, with this proposal so as to
protect the world from aggression.

“We will agree to disarma-
ment only when there is a gen-
uine base for security,” he said,
explaining that this base must
be in the form of a revised
United Nations.

He further recommended that
we provide for “an infusion called
‘moral imagination.’ ” He added
that we be willing to die our-
selves rather than be the first to
use nuclear weapons, and that we
save 50 per cent of our funds to
give as economic aid for Asia and
Africa»-for‘ the homes and schools
and hospitals they need so badly.

THE DEAN YOU SAVE MAY BE YOUR OWN

Now in the waning days of the school year when the hardest
heart grows mellow and the very air is charged with memories,
let us pause fora moment and pay tribute to that overworked
and underappreciated campus ﬁgure, your friend and mine, the
dean of students. .

Policeman and confessor, shepherd and seer, warden and

oracle, proconsul and pal, the dean of students is by far the"

most enigmatic of all academicians. How can we understand
him? Well sir, perhaps the best way is to take an average day
in the life of an average dean. Here, for example, is what hap-

pened last Thursday to Dean Killjoy N. Damper of Duluth '

A and M. . _

At 6 am. h.e woke, dressed, lit a Marlboro, and went up on
the roof of his house to remove the statue of the Founder which
had been placed there during the night by high—spirited under-
graduates.

At 7 a.m. he lit a Marlboro and walked briskly to the campus.
(The Deanhad not been driving his car since it had been placed
on the roof of the girls dormitory by high—spirited under-
graduates.)

  

At 17:45 a.m. he arrived on campus, lit a Marlboro, and
climbed‘ the bell tower to remove his sccret2u'y who had been
placed there during the night by high-spirit-ed undergra,d'uates.

At 8 am. he reached his oflice, lit a Marlboro, and met with
Derther Sigafoos, editor of the student newspaper. Young
Sigafoos had been writing a series of editorials “urging the
United States to annex Canada. When his editorials had evoked
no response, he had taken matters into his own hands. Accom-
panied by his sports editor and two copy reailers, he had gone
over the border and conquered Nl.:'tDll30l)il. With great patie;m'-,e
and several excellent Marlboro Cigarettes, the Dean persuaded
young Sigafoos to give Manitoba bar-.k. Young S‘ignrloo.<:, l;_u'>w-
ever, insisted on keeping Winnipeg.

At 9 am. the Dean lit a Marlboro and met with Erwin J.
Bender, president of the local Sigma Chi chapter, who came to
report that the Deke house had been put on top of the Sigma
Chi house, during the night by high—spirited undergraduat-es..

At 10 a.m. the Dean li_t a Marlboro and Went to umpire an
intramural softball game on the roof of the law school where the
campus baseball diamond had been placed during the niglit by
high—spirited undergraduates. , C

At 12 noon the Dean had a luncheon Ineeting with the presi-
dent of the university, the bursar, the registrar, and the cha.ir-
man of the English department. at the bottom of the (-mripus
swimming pool where the faculty dining room had been placed
during the night by higih-spirited updergraduatcs. l\:'l2,tl‘ll)()I.'(‘)S
were passed after lunch, but not lit owing to the dampness.

At 2 p.m., back in his office, the Dean lit a .l.\/la..rlbo1'o and

. received the Canadian minister of war who said that iuiless
young Sigafoos gave back Winnipeg, Canada would ma.rch.
Young Sigafoos was summoned and agreed to give lnuck \:Vi1mi-
peg if he could have Saskat-oon. The (i‘n.nadian minister of war
at first refused, but ﬁnally agreed aft-or young Sigafoos placed
him on the roof of the mining and rnetallurgy building.

At 3 p.:m. the Dean lit a Marlboro and met with a delegation
l'_ro.m the student council who came to present him witha set
of matched luggage in honor of his fifty years’ service as dean
of students. The Dean promptly packed the luggage with his
clothing and M arlboros and ﬂed to Utica, New York, where he

‘ Cheering /or Cash

“Money means more spirit,” according to the recently
selected 1961-62 cheerleading squad. More money is their
problem, and a larger Student Government appropriation
is the only solution.

Although the new squad has forecast an unbalanced
budget and curtailment of trips during football season, their
cause appears rather hopeless since their. credit rating has
dropped.

A cheerleading squad gains a good credit rating when
it can evoke an audible response from the crowd and when
it exhibits enthusiasm itself.

During the_ past football season, there seemed to be a
lack of both. During basketball season, it was worse, and
SG members, as well as other students, remember the
allrltltillt Bf t‘éaH'l support generated and also the many oc-
casions when the cheerleading squad showed no‘ enthusiasm
—-for example, when they did not welcome a victorious

football team home from Syracuse.

But that was last year’s squad. Should SG hold this
year’s squad responsible for their action? —

No. But this is probably not the main reason why they
do not want to give them additional funds. Everyone seems
to feel that more tripsduring football season beneﬁt the
cheerleading squad much more than the team or other stu-
dents. And when you ask yourself if trips should be the

highlight of a cheerleader’s career, the only honest answer

is no.

If they desire additional outlets for enthusiasm, there
are always the basketball games or the wrestling and gym-
nastic meets at home. Even now, with baseball season start-
ing, there is ample opportunity for support. Cheering would

. help them as much as it helps the football team, and at

the same time would reveal a group sincere enough to sup-
port other University sports, rather than one worrying
about traveling to other schools during football season. Is
it lack of spirit or lack of trips that concerns them?
Nevertheless, more money could help the cheerlead-

‘ ing squad gain more spirit if the money was distributed

evenly among all the athletic departments and if it were
used for open-house pep rallies.

_ One thing is certain. When the cheerleading squad does
eliminate the cheerless crowd, getting more money will be
no problem.

Need for Prosecution . . .

Justice and Eichmann

By -Nathan Firestone

The 20th century world seems plagued by an
almost obscene desire to forget any unpleasantness
that might have been forced upon it by the par-
tially successful German solution to the “Jewish

,Question” during the years im-

mediately preceding and during
World War II.

But whether or not this is
right, it is only natural, and is
being manifested today by the
stream of legal objections raised
to the Eichmann trial.

This should pose a question.
Is everything that is legal always
just? Is it not possible that this
host of legal arguments is ob-
scuring justice? » ,

Granted, Israel did violate Argentina’s sov-
ereignty by capturing Eichmann there and remov-
ing him without going through proper channels.

Granted, Israel is trying the man today for
crimes that were committed up to three years be-
fore the existence of the state. '

But one fact remains outstanding. Eichmann’s
crimes were committed against Jews in particular,
and not against humanity at large. Humanity was
not concerned enough with him to hunt him down,
while Jews were. - -

Why Israel?

If any community of Jews in the world were as
well organized and had as good facilities for deal-
ing with Eichmann as has Israel, then I would say
that such a comunity would have just as much a
right as Israel to deal with him.

But Israel, and not Germany nor Hungary nor
Poland nor Rumania nor France must deal with
him because it is a Jewish state, and Eichmann’s
crimes were directed-against Jews.

An almost ridiculous point of argument is that

Re-alignment an Answer ? . .

 

Eichmann has already been proven guilty before
being brought to trial, and that, therefore, the trial
will be a mere showcase. That suggests to me 3
line of reasoning in which any accused criminal
faced with overwhelming evidence against him
should not be brought to trial because his guilt
is already proven.

But the most unbelievable argument I have
heard yet against the trial comes from those who
say that there is no use holding a trial because no
punishment could ﬁt his crime. No punishment can
fit his crime, but does that mean that this man,
who is responsible for the death of so many inno-
cent people (the figure has been placed at between
ﬁve and six million Jews) be allowed to walk free?

Just Punishment? ? ? -

Perhaps if we were living in a completely moral
world in which Eichmann would assuredly be
ostracized by one and all, this would be appropri-
ate. But we are not, and there are enough Nazi
sympathizers left who would be happy to comfort
him. i I

Dying only one death is not ﬁtting for‘Eichmann,
but it is proper. It is ﬁnal such as no other punish-
ment could be. «

The most candid and honest objection I have
heard to the trial is that it may cause old wounds
to reopen. Let no one mistake this. The wounds
have never closed, nor should they. No German
should ever be permitted to forget what his gov-
ernment did from 1933-45. In fact, it might be a
good catharsis for the German people, and the
world, to watch such a show periodically.

The Israel trial serves a dual purpose. First,
it will mete out punishment to the man. But sec-
ondly, and more important, it will not permit any-
one to close his eyes reﬂectively and say, “But that
happened sixteen years ago. It’s too bad, but it
won’t happen again.” It will if people aren’t con-
tinually reminded of it.

A Matter of Duty

By Dan Johnson

Politicians today cry out there is a need for a
re-alignment in American politics. These politi-
cians claim that the present political ‘structure of
our nation should be re—organized along liberal-
conservative lines. They would
have the liberal Republicans join
with the majority of the Demo-
crats to form a ‘re—organized
Democratic party, and the south-
ern Democrats align themselves
with most of the Republicans to
form a conservative Republican
party.

However, this blurring of
idealogical lines is only a symp-
tom of a greater fault in Amer-
ican politics. The politicians of
today are not working for a better country or a
better world, but instead each is working toward
his own selﬁsh aims.

After the Vote

Their sole concern in taking sides on an issue
is to gain votes. They will not go against pseudo-
public opinion under any circumstances even if
they personally believe that acting differently
would rebound to the nation’s ultimate good, al-
though it would mean a loss of personal popular-
ity for the moment.

Depressed area legislation is an example of an
elected official working for the selﬁsh aims of his
constituents. We need politicians who will rise

 

above the race to get re-elected and who will work
for their true beliefs.

The party Out Of power must continue to work
for what it believes is good for the countrygnot
what will return it to power. Historically, our
future depends not only on the program of the
party in power, but also on the actions of the oppo-
sition. It can only be through “the dialectric of
policies” that our system can function properly.

Working for the Good

Under these conditions we will surely have a
better government whether it be conservative or
liberal, because the parties will be truly working
for what they believe to be good for the nation.
Perhaps today some of the top leaders are working
for their true beliefs, but in order for the United
States to retain its position as the leader of the

pworld’s democracies, most officials in the future,

must holdpthis viewpoint.

The viewpoint of the future ofﬁcial must be that
of. a public servant not of an.overlord. He must
endeavor to do good for the country and to keep
himself fully informed on the issues of the day.
We need dedicated officials.

The suggested conservative-liberal re-alignment
will not solve anything. Perhaps it is much better
to have the major parties divided‘ this way, because
under present conditions the ofﬁcials cannot be
herded by their leaders into blindly voting for a
party resolution. What our country really needs
is a re—alignment of our politicians’ ultimate aims
and sense of duty.

Letters to the Editor

Senior Blasts

Messenger Critics

Editor, The Pitt News:

There has been mixed feelings
over the recent appearance of a
new publication on the Pitt
scene, the I.F. Messenger. Sev-
eral fraternity members have re-
ceived this first attempt to con-
solidate Greek organizations with
unwarranted criticism and un-
fair comments.

These critics, being fraternity

members, are unaware of the
fractured and corfipetitive spirit
among fraternities which pre-

vails at Pitt. Fraternity men who
have visited other schools and
have seen other Greek organiza-
tion, comment on the disunity
found here.

The I.F. Messenger, recognizing
this and other forces which have
tended to maintain and increase
distance among in d i vi d u al
houses, wished to bring some
element of unity to the system.

Operating on an infintesimal
budget, no circulation procedure,
and unorganized preparation; the
staff of three or four managed to
produce a communicative piece
for a group which is often bom-
barded and seldom praised.

 

Fraternities and the fraternity
system are not accepted every-

"where; nor does it care to be.

Uninformed public opinion and
imagery has collectively grouped
fraternities as an unnecessary
facet of one‘s college experience.,
Not everyone needs or should
join a Greek organization. The
role of the I.F. Messenger is to
unite the individual fraternities,
inform the academic community
in areas of interest and insure
that a system is in existence for
thhose who desire membership in
a Greek organization.

“THE TINKER’S WEDDING”

Beall
c 4:

By W. SCOTT LARSON

The University Theater present-
ed two of its best productions last
weekend in the showing of Anton

. "Chekov’s “On the Harmful Use of
and John M. Synge’s
“The Tinker’s Wedding” in the
eleventh floor theater.

Chekov’s entertaining mono-
logue featured Lawrence Bloom as
Ivan Ivanovi.ch Nyukhin, a Rus-
sian lecturer who was felled by
the great misfortune of being do-
minated by the overwhelming in-
fluence of his wife. As in other
Chekov plays, the social structure
of the times in Russia is reflected
in the character of the script.

Bloom skillfully interpreted the
meaning of the play and did an
outstanding job in his portrayal.

Confusing Trio
_ “The Tinker’s Wedding” is a
one act comedy in two scenes.
Michael Byrne, a wandering tink-
er of Western Ireland, played by
Gilbert Lazier, is constantly tor-
mented by his “woman,” Sarah
Casey, (Judith Gelman) to marry
her. Byr_ne refuses to consider
such nonsense because of the
strong objections which are made
by his mother, Mary Byrne (Ruth
Beall).
When Sarah ﬁnally persuades

(or rather buys the services of)

the local priest (Larry Heller)

Ruth Larry Heller

,- to marry them secretively, the

mother discovers the plan and
makes off with the tin can, part

Gil Lazier Judy Gelnum

8 I! I3
of the marital fee imposed by
the priest, to trade it for a pint
of local grog. ‘

When the priest discovers that
part of his fee was consumed in
drink by the old lady, he refuses
to marry the couple and orders
them out of the area. Tempers
flare and the poor priest ﬁnds that
the odds are three to one against
him. In a matter of seconds he is
bound and gagged and plans are
being made to deposit him in the
local stream.

Comic Ending

After thinking more on the mat-
ter, the three decide to free him
if he promises not to report them
to the authorities. When they free
him, however, he promises
doom them all to Hell and the
whole affair ends by the triad be-

ing chased off stage by the good

Father.

The whole play was exqui-
sitely acted by all hands, espe-
cially by Miss Beall. Her per-
formance in the role of a ﬁre-
and-brirnstone Irish widow who
frequently taps the keg, was
well done and deserving of high
merit.

The settings were well suited to
the limited space in the “little
theater-in-the-air,” and it goes
without saying that the direction
by Ralph Allen is definitely wor-
thy of merit.

In Golf Match

Ohio University will host the

Panther golfers this Friday.
Chances for a Win seem to be
slim.

“Ohio has an excellent team,”
commented Bill Hoffman, number
3 man in the last match at Ohio
State. “They have a bunch of long
hitters. They usually knock ’em
out of sight.”

Coach George Underwood will
probably go with the same line-
up he used in the opener. Don
Derrnitt, number one man, Stuart
Snodgrass, number two, Bill Hoff-
man, Dale Long, Jack Vesseleny
and”Don Swanson will round out
the starting six. _

Last Saturday. the Panthers
ﬁnished last of four. teams at
Ohio State University. This poor
showing can be partly attributed
to a slip-up in the Athletic De-
partment. The golfers, believing
the match to be an 18 hole event
starting in the afternoon, ar-
rived 3 hours late, at 11 o’clock.
As a result, they had no chance
to practice and played through
a rushed 18 holes.

Dermitt’s 82 was the only bright
spot in that match. “We had cold
and windy weather. The course
was strange to us and it was ex-
tremely long. We might have done
better had we played a practice
round ﬁrst,” complained Hoffman.

The poor weather here in Pitts-
burgh has hindered golf practice.
Some players from Ohio State had
been down south to practice. The
Panthers will have to be sharp to
defeat Ohio University this Fri-
day.

On Saturday the golfers will
host Virginia and Duquesne in the
first home match of the year. The
match will be played at the Wild-
wood Club.

Ralph Shutterly, the solo letter-

again. Ralph was clipped for four
runs in his ﬁrst outing last week.

Kent State will visit the same
ﬁeld on Friday and Bucknell will
oppose the Panthers on Saturday
at West -Field in Munhall. This
ﬂurry of contests promises to put
a heavy strain on the thin Pitt
lineup.

Frank Ignaczak, the team‘s
hardest thrower, hurt his arm,
ﬁring in the inclement weather
of California, Pa. With Pete.
Suder, the ﬁnal choice for first
base, forced to play shortstop
temporarily because there are
no reserves, pitcher Lauren
Guthrie has been forced to play
first base.

Another hurler, Larry Oarra,
even had to ﬁll in at second base.
This indicates that the pitchers
have been called upon to per-
form above and beyond the call
of duty.

Including the mound staff, Lew-
is only has 12 players eligible for
the next four games. He’ll have to
do some clever ‘manipulation to
squeeze the most out of each
player. _

To add to Lewis’ woes, Bobby
New, potential first-string catcher,
was just recently ruled ineligible.
It is expected that he will be able
to join the team in the spring.

There is one ray of hope for the
shortage problem. Tom Maloney,
ace backcourtman on Bob Tim-
mons’ basketball team, has joined
the troupe in hopes of bolstering
the depleted nine.

good cheer to grid coach John
Michelosen. It was about
that time that he found out

that three of his tackles, reg-

A ular Bob Budavich and two

promising sophomores, Bob
Zvolerin and Chuck Adonizio,
were dropped from school due
academic difficulties.

The tackle situation, which had
been a little shaky, is now a ma-
jor problem.

The Panther will have three
lettermen, Gary Kaltenbach, Bob
Guzik, and Dave Mastro, to man
the tackle slots this fall.

240 Pound Bruiser

At right tackle Michelosen can
look with comfort to the massive
frame of Kaltenbach. The bruis-_
ing 240 pounder was a defensive
standout on last year’s squad
which specialized in being stingy
to the opponents. He saw most of
his action on defense last year,
but the coaches are conﬁdent he
can toe the mark offensively, also.

Behind Kaltenbach is a host
of inexperienced gridders. Most
familiar is John Maczuzak, who
earned fame on the basketball
court. Maczuzak worked out at
center last year, but ‘the thin-
ness at tackles prompted his
switch.

Another defensive stalwart at
right tackle is Gerry Cherry. The
225 pounder was outstanding for
the Frosh last year in this capac-
ity and should see action with the
varsity next fall.

Battle At Tackle

Others with a good chance to
seeing action at right tackle are
Bob Ostrosky and Elmer Merkov-
sky. ~
On the other side of the line
the tackle post is a three Way

chik and Ernie Borghetti. Guzik
was battling for a starting post
last year until he was injured.
He never got back in the groove
after his return and alternated
between the second and fourth
teams for the rest of the season.
A sound Guzik will be a big
help to the gridders.

Adamchik and Borghetti didn’t
see varsity action last year but
have impressed the coaches
enough to merit a shot at the
starting berth.

Mastro on Defense

Mastro got his chance when
Guzik was hurt. The 6'5” giant
appeared to have the choaches’
confidence on defense, but was
usually taken out when the Cats
had the ball. He will probably be
used the same way next season.

Ron Marini and Jeff Ware, up
from last year’s undefeated Fresh-
man team, could help out at left
tickle, also.

Barring any unforseen happen-
ings, the tackle corps should be
able to hold their own but won’t
be the position to bulwark the
Panthers’ forward wall.

Rain Cancels Tennis

Meet at California

Rainy weather, the villian that
has been hampering an of the
University squads from favored
practiced conditions. ‘forced the
cancellation of the tennis team's
match at California State Teach-
ers College on Monday.

It has been rescheduled for Sat-
urday, May 6. The day is not a
total loss, however, as Head Coach
Bill Summers is working with the
boys on the Field House handball
courts. _

After a successful opener against
Juniata, Summers would like to
make it two in a row with a win
over Duquesne this Friday. The
Dukes have two ﬁne players re-
turning in Cliff Narvieson and
Marty Katz. The boys from the
hill were not too troublesome to
the Cats last season, losing 8-1 and
7-2. ‘

“We’re looking for trouble
from the Bluﬂites," commented

Coach Summers. Summers also

added that as soon as the weath-
er permitted, he would continue
the challenge matches to deter-
mine each players position.

On Saturday the Panthers will
face a strong team from Kent
State on the Wildwood Courts.
The racquetmen are seeking to
avenge last year’s 8-1 loss to the
highly experienced team from
Ohio. ‘

Now's the Time
To Lower Cats’

Track Schedule

By JACK SMITH
E.vecut1'.ve Sports Editor

IIIIIIIIIIIHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
Imlnumlnnmlmlmanvnrm-W

 

Pitt’s Athletic Depart.ment has made two big mistakes
in track over -the past few years. First, the Department sched-
ules track teams that are much better than Pitt’s teams,
and secondly, it fails to bring in trackmen to handle even
a mediocre schedule.

Athletic Director Frank Carver said last week at the
A1]—Sports Banquet that the University, with the athletic
material it posses, could have won more games this year. I
believe in the case of the Panther track team which suffered
the worst defeat in 35 years, 104-27, to Maryland last Sat-
urday, this is not true. The Panthers track team is doing the
very best it can this year with the materials it has. The only
problem is—-it has no material.

The primary reason the Panthers don’t have the ma- l
tcrialpto compete with the better schools across the coun-
try is their poor track scholarship offers. Pitt trackmen
only get tuition, books and ‘fees. Although several fresh-
men receive full scholarships, most of the trackmen -
pay for their own room and board. Several athletes have
to live above the Stadium.

Track teams that are able to compete with the nation’s A

best give full scholarships, as many as 25 of them, which in-
clude room and board. ’

It's the old story that you get what you pay for. Until
Pitt pays for top track material it will never have either
quantity or quality. *

Next, the University has been scheduling meets with
teams like Maryland and Villanova. Because these schools
offer their trackmen full scholarships, they possess the ma-
terial in quantity and quality to compete in still competition.
“We have no business scheduling schools like Maryland. They
are not in our class,”said a Pitt coach after Saturday’s meet.
Schools like Maryland can put a fresh man in each event
while Pitt must often use one man in three events.

If.Pitt is unable to give full scholarships to get top
track material, it is time to schedule colleges like Adel-
phi and Yeshiva.

Football Coach John Michelosen is taking his crew
through their spring shakedown cruise to discover his forces’
gridiron potential. Players have been dropping out of action
with minor injuries. - '

It is characteristic, however, for the seasoned player
to be plagued by minor injuries at this time of year. It
may be psychological that the gridders want to miss
spring practice.

* * :2! ‘-ll *

Barring injury, Jumbo Jim Traﬁcant has the experience,
confidence and ability to become the Panther’s next All-
American football quarterback.

“Many quarterbacks,” says Fred Cox, the Panther best
all-around gridder, “throw a pass hard but it knocks you
over when you try to catch it. Jim throws with his ﬁnger

tips and although the ball comes at you hard, it can be '

caught easily.”

If the Panther track team

feels it had a problem with

Maryland last week, wait un-

til it faces Navy at Annapolis

Saturday. Navy has depth

strength in both running
and ﬁeld events and oddsmakers
say that there won’t be much of an
improvement of the Maryland
score, 104-27.,

But Panther co-captains Bill
Hinchberger and Dan Kanell will
make their own bets on the out-
come. “We looked bad last week,”
Hinchberger said, “but one reason
was that it was our first meet.
Many of our runners we ﬁgured
for better performances and there
is no reason why we shouldn’t im-
prove.” .

Perhaps the biggest disappoint-
ment for both the team and Coach
Carl Rees was Vance Carter’s per-
formance. Since Harry Stokes,

joined the army, the burden of
task has fallen on the shoulders
of Carter.
Last week he was not equal to
the occasion as he managed only

 

one point, taking a third in the
440-yard dash. Rees withheld
Carter from the mile relay be-
cause he appeared to be sick.

“We must get a better perform-
ance from not only Carter but our W
other men in running events,”
Rees lamented. “There is no rea-
son why we should lose to Navy
by a big score although they can
put a fresh man in each event
while we must often use one man
in three events.”

The Panthers have lost to the
midshipmen the past two years,

66-65.

Horowitz Talks

011Boml)Effect

SANE Hear] Outlines

Causes of Nuclear War
' By JULES ZACHER

“At this very moment there are
planes of our Air Force overhead
carrying a bomb powerful enough
to wipe out any city in the world.”
Howard Horowitz presented this
fact before the Young Democrats
Club last Thursday.

Horowitz, president of the Stu-
dent Committee for Sane Nuclear
Policy here at the University, and
Ralph Hallow, another member of
this committee started the discus-
sion by outlining the effects of
one of our nuclear bombs.

Horowitz said that one bomb
would spread complete destruction
over a 5,000 square-mile area, and
radiation after the explosion was
over would take hundreds of
thousands of others lives in areas
20 to 50 miles away.

Presents Incidents

He continued his polemic by
presenting three ways that _ the
world could go to war involving
the use of nuclear armaments. The
ﬁrst, according to Horowitz, is an
error in judgment. To illustrate

A this point, Horowitz turned to a

recent incident that did not re-
ceive any publicity, in America.
The president of Sane told
the Young Democrats that two
months ago, the North American
Air Defense Command received
the Red Warning form Thule,

Greenland, our ﬁrst line of de-

fense. ‘

The base at Colorado tried to
Contact our base at Thule, but
could not get through. This led
the commander of the base to be-
lieve that Thule had been wiped
out.

The Commander of the base
wanted to retailiate with our wea-
pons, but was only held back
from doing this by his second
in command, a Canadian.

Error is Cause

According to Horowitz, a tech-
nical error was really the cause
of the whole incident.

“Our radar up at Thule,” said-
Horowitz, “had picked up what
appeared to be deﬁnitely a‘
missile, but through malfunc-
tion of this‘ radar, what ap-
peared to be a. missile was ac-
tually that old phenomenon, the
moon.” _

Horowitz said that through a
twist of fate, the submarine cable
from Thule to the mainland had
been cut by an iceberg.”

The third and ﬁnal way that
there could be a-nuclear war ac-

cording to Horowitz, was if. the

military in some countries effected
a coup d’etat and took over. the
government. .

Horowitz feels then that the
military would use the nuclear
weapons for their own beneﬁt or
mistakenly for the beneﬁt of their
countries and plunge the world
into most horrbile war man has
ever or will ever see.
