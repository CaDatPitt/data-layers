‘Walk’er to the Door’

A man who has driven a girl
friend to her home unfortunately
backs into the girl friend as she
is crossing behind the car. The
girl, hereafter known as the plain-
tiff, sues her boy friend, hereafter
known as the defendant.

So, members of the jury, what
would be your verdict?

The boys on the fourteenth ﬂoor
will debate this as they meet for
their moot court tomorrow at 2
o‘clock.

The case of the fractured frail
versus the bumptious beau is part
of the permanent program of the
Law school, intendel to give stu-
dents as much practical experi-
ence as possible before they ap-
pear before real judges and
jurors.

.Women. Sew Ihwzsses for Cap and Gown

As lVorrietl, Blushing ‘Girls’ Are Fitted

. By GEORGIA suvssr

If you take the trouble to push
aside the assorted silks and satins
that invariably greet. you as you en-
ter 828 Cathedral any afternoon,
you will find two very lovely
ladies——mothcr and daughter, but
looking more like sister and sister.

They are Mrs. Maude Corkan
and her 18-year-old daughter, Val-
lie Anne, vrhose ambition is to be a
costume designer.

If you wonder what women are
doing in the Cap and Gown office,
they select, adjust, and sometimes
design the costumes for the show.

l\.»£’rs. Corkan, who has done cos-
Iurse designing for several Carne-
gie Tech Scotch and Soda produc-
tions. as well as numerous other
shows, was sitting at her sewing-

machine Friday afternoon and
chuckling over the attempt of one
of the performers to ﬁt himself into
a lacy but uplifting bit of feminine
underwear.

“They’re jus' like a bunch 0'
babies,” she drawled. She’s orig-
inally from Nashville, Tenn., and
is now living on Margaretta street
in the East End.

“But you'd be surprised," she
‘»"-‘€111 011, “They certainly 
taste where clothes are concerned.
They know jus’ v.ihat’ll look nice
on them, and they look at a dress
with an eye for color, ‘material, and

The versatile seamstress explain-
ed ‘».l'.at “a lot of them take it just
like they’re playin’ house. They
get a big kick out o' the whole

thing."

While she was showing me some
of the costumes to be used in the
musical comedy, a junior engineer-
ing student timidly approached her.

"I——uh wonder if 1 could have a
fitting.” he asked. Mrs. Corkan
took her tape measure from off a
pile of rhinestone-studded evening
gowns, and before the befuddled
engineer knew what had happened.
she had recorded all his measure-
ments in her little black book.

“How will I have enough time

Youth “"ill Be Served - - -

Dead or Alive

“AVERAGE AGE of the rioters was 15 years.”

“The 17-year-old monarch faces a bloody and uncertain future.”

“High school and university students rose in protest, ﬁghting
with makeshift weapons from street to street.”

These are the bulletins that reach us from the wires of
Europe. This is the way of the world in these times.

We know the comment of the street-car riders. The kids
in America, they say, are too soft. They’re pampered and they’re
yellow.

We have no dogmatic answer to make to this. Even the
most sophisticocynical of us must admit, albeit casually, the
bravery of the Yugoslav youth.

Our only conclusion is that the present shape of events may
prove a lot of things. It proves, certainly, what has long been
the contention of the platitudinizing history professor: that
in times of stress it is the younger element of the population
which rises into prominence; and that in settled times the reins
of government return to the more staid, conservative elders.

More important, perhaps, the Yugoslav upheaval may
answer something about which we have wondered ever since
1933. We have wondered about the way the peoples of Europe
took to the new totalitarian order. Always in the back of our
minds there was the inhibited suspicion that perhaps this was
the form of government best ﬁtted to the Continental tempera-
ment, that perhaps we were meddlers who were trying to su-
perimpose the principles of democracy where they would not
work.

Perhaps now we have our answer.

The Dastardly Labor Unions

Attack Defenseless Business

The newspaper says DRASTIC CURBS AGAINST LABOR
WILL BE ASKED IN CONGRESS.

We like the one-sidedness of this headline. We love it. It
makes labor sound like the heel the newspapers say it is. And
we all know that labor is a heel. Because it gets ground under

the foot of business so often it has assumed this shape in the
eyes of the newspaper readers of the good old USA.

Of course we see eye to eye with the newspapers. Here
are a bunch of foreign agitators seeking to overthrow the free
enterprise system, of the steel monopoly price structure in the
sad, sad case of Bethlehem steel corporation. Or some Russian
bolsheviks are trying to seize the management of the most hu-
mane motor company going, the benevolent Ford-Harry Ben-
net-W. J. Cameron Trucking company.

And we can see eye to eye with the disinterested newspapers
who kept very, very quiet when their partners in business held
up the defense program for months until they got their eight
per cent. There was no use quibbling after it was ‘all over,
anyway. Who wants to bedevil our great benevolent business
men, when they are trying so hard to do a job well, what with
all the silly laws to limit proﬁts and such socialistic claptrap?

What’s more we’ll go the whole way. We will go all the
way with the very honorable and evidently intellectual chair-
man of the House judiciary committee, a biped running around
attached to the name of Hatton W. Sumners (Dem., Tex.) who
advocated ending defense strikes even if “it’s necessary to send
men to the electric chair.” In fact we are thinking of sending
in a bill toour congressman entitled “HR. 1941, To Further the
Defense of the United States of America, a Bill to Commit One

Phillip Murray to the Electric Chair for the Mental Murder of
Eighteen Directors of the Bethlehem Steel Corporation.”

And there is one other thing we can’t stand for. And that
thing is the rowdiness of strikers who overturn police cars, take
out the tear gas bombs which were by divine guidance destined
for the strikers themselves, and throw them at retreating harm-
less policemen, who were merely out for a drive in the sun-
shine, it being spring.

If these strikers have the temerity to divert divine justice
from the paths predestined by responsible company oﬁicials,
what won’t they do next? The ﬁrst thing you know, these union
{thugs will be demanding that they be listened to. And then
where will business be? Huh?

0 Q
A1n’t Culture Grand llep/I:

TMANY OF US HAVE DEPLORED the entrance into Dr.
Harold Sch’oenberger’s English class last Friday of sleepy Slapsie-
Maxie Rosenbloom.

Some of us developed strabismus in the attempt to reconcile
our eyes to the sight of Rosenbloom ranging upwards on a ver-
tical plane. A

Most of us spent 20 minutes admiring his ability to neatly
and without -the slightest effort split an inﬁnitive.

All of us came to thelconclulsion that it was silly of Rosen-
bloom to attempt the involvements of the English language. If
there had to be any form of social adjustment, it would have
been inﬁnitely easier for Dr. Schoenberger to learn the technique
of self-defense.

An interested news item related
the case of a gasoline “bootlegger”
who had continued to crack oil after
the passage of the Oil Conservation
act of 1968. He was found in pos-
session of a small plant which sup-
plied a ﬂeet of antiquated trucks.

Last Thursday evening, after a
“tough” afternoon in Mr. Hoop-

reading the Press. My vague rec-
ollection of the Yugoslavian revolt
and the Allis—Chalmers strike is
nearly obliterated by the 1971
Press I read in my sleep.

A report by a federal expert gave
several reasons for the fact that

Pittsburgh’s population was down
to four hundred thousand. He felt
that the rising cost of coal had
drawn many industries south
where they are now operating on
electricity furnished by the gov-
ernment power plants at Boulder
dam and Tennessee valley. The
high cost of living in the city, now
without the tax revenue from these
industries, had forced many resi-
denters to establish homes in the
rural districts.

was of great signiﬁcance in regard
to the population shift. The aver-

The Pitt News

Swing Things
 i AlI.Gator

After a little checking we’ve dis-
covered that well over three months
ago recording of “Perﬁdia”—and a
lot of them—were on the market.
Today it’s being publicized just
as if it were something hot from
the composer's pen. Realizing that
it cannot be classiﬁed as strictly
popular, it’s still remarkable to us
that “Perﬁdia” is so much on top
when most hit tunes are dead and
forgotten after three months.

Among the many recordings that
have been made of “Perﬁdia” we
can think of two released by Dec-
ca we’d like to comment on. One is
by Jimmy Dorsey. It reminds us
somewhat of something the old
Artie Shaw outﬁt might have done
—a fast-moving version without
vocal which completely ignores the
Spanish heritage in favor of una-
dulated swing. It’s good, by the
way.

Ruby Newman’s recordings of
“Perﬁdia” is far more in the Span-
ish style, but we aren’t particular-
ly impressed. It's ok, but that’s
about all. On the reverse is a
Xavier Cugat conga creation, “One-
Two-Three, Kick.” It, too, is the
kind of thing you might not ﬁle
under “W” (the wastebasket), but
if shelling out hard cash, you’ve
probably turn to something else on
wax.

Over on the Victor-Bluebird
front, that company introduces
Enric Madriguera’s vocalist, Patri-
cia Gilmore, under her own label.
Her first release combines “I’ve Got
to Get Hot” and “Give Me Time.”
Both are torchy show—tune songs.
This record is not for dancing.

Although we’ve never cared for
Larry Clinton, we must admit that
his “Isn’t It Time to Fall in Love”
(his theme, by the way) is excel-
lent. Peggy Mann sings. “Blind
Date,” on the other side, is that old
stereoyped Clinton hash. The
tune’s corny besides.

We were rather amused when,
in the March issue of Metronome,
they called the Metronome All-Star
recording the best release of the
month . . latest screwy song ti-
tle is “I Come, I Saw, I Conga’d.”

Some think that marriage

After the Military

There were 3,000 of us in the
room. We found 17 new creases in
our clothes and somebody’s wallet
in our hip-pocket. Cousin Suzan
was in from Podunk, but we had

to communicate with her by car-
rier pigeon (“I beg your pardon,
sir, but the roof of a Statler hotel
never leaks”). Everyone was do-
ing the conga, and we, by process
of ultimate elimination and ﬂowing
masses, were doing same. Two
jitterbuggers were highly ﬂattered
when the crowd opened to watch
them, leaving them room for two
steps forward and one to the side.
Among other things tapped were
the initiates of Scabbard and Blade.

Bob Bentley followed the trend
when he dropped his date with the
much-to-be-desired freshman Ettie
Lou Duncan at the last minute and
led another girl (McKeesport,
maybe?) to the MB.

Panthers Stage Annual
Intra-Squad Track Meet

Dusty Rhoades, Bill Carter, Stickel
Lead Assault on Old Indoor Records

At last three varsity records are
slated for the scrap heap and ﬁve
others are in jeopardy as the Pitt
ireslzmen and varsity trackmen
make their ninth annual assault on
the Pitt indoor track house records
in the University championships
staged by Panther coaches Carl Ol-
son and James Potts, tomorrow,

Wednesday, and Thursday after-
noon.
The idea of scheduling these

events on different days is an inno-
vation on the part of the Pitt
eoaches, the twenty-four hour rest
periods giving many of the boys a
Chance to appear in more events
and shoot for several records. The
performances made by the fresh-
man thinclads will not only be at-
tempts for new standards, but will
also be matched against those of
the University of Michigan fresh-
man team in a postal track meet.
Peluchais Mark Doomed

Tomorrow afternoon, the mark
most certain to fall is the pole vault
record of 12 feet nine inches made
by Cy Pelucha in 1934. Both Dusty
Rhoades and Red J essup, the junior
pole vauling twins, soared almost
a foot past this mark in the Butler
relays two weeks ago when they
leaped 13 feet eight inches.

In the track house this pair has
continually pushed to 13 feet four
inches, and the 13 foot mark itself
is little more than a practice jump.
Consequently, it seems very un-
likely that Pitt fans will not see a
new record set tomorrow afternoon.

In both the 50-yard dash and
two-lap dash, Bullet Bill Carter
and Hap Stickel will gun for new
sprint records, but the marks they
try to shatter will require more ef-
fort than the pole vaulters will
need to expend in their event. Car-
ter, who tied Jess Owens’ world
record in the 60-yard dash at In-
dianapolis, is favored in the for-
mer, but Stickel must be rated an
even bet in the latter.

Later this week, this pair will

clash in the 50-yard low hurdles,
and Bullet Bill will also broad
lump. Carter made his initial try
on the low hurdles this week when
Stickel deserted the track for the
football ﬁeld, and he looked like a
natural. Having tied one of Owens’
marks already, Carter tries an
Owens stint, when he shoots for top
ranking in both dashes, the broad
jump, and low hurdles.

Allias Favored

In tomorrow’s other contest, the
one-mile run, sophomore Marcus
Allias is favored to triumph over
Zeke Sterner, the two-miler de-
luxe, Frank McCabe, John Brosky,
Ben Foote, and Bob Davis. Red
Tost’s trackhouse mark of 4:30.5
looms too formidable for the soph-
omore synchronizer to shatter.

Outstanding freshmen in tomor-
row’s events are Pat Patterson in
the 50-yard and two-lap dash,
Bill Curtis and Herbert McGib-
beny in the mile, Bob Smith in the
two-lap dash, and Joe Zupanic,
Bruce Reuter, and Bob King in the
pole vault. Curtis and Zupanic are
most likely to score over Michigan
records.

Wednesday's Program

Wednesday afternoon the Blue
and Gold runners will compete in
the 50-yard low hurdles, the 50-
ya.rd high hurdles, and the 880-
yard run, while the ﬁeld men will
limit their competition to the broad
jump. Thursday afternoon the
schedule includes the 440-yard run,
the two mile, the 16-pound shot
put, and high jump. The program
is carded for 4 o’clock each after-
noon, and the student body is in-
vited.

Spring Sports
List Announced
In Intramural s

With the spring intramural pro-
gram slated to start on April 16,
managers of both the Independent
and Fraternity leagues are begin-
ning to round their charges into
shape for the coming battles.

This year the schedule will in-
clude four sports, horseshoes, ten-
nis, mushball, and golf. with teams
entering from the Independent,
Fraternity, and Engineering league.

The systems used for the four
sports will be the same as those
used last year. Horseshoes will be
round-robin with a two man team;
tennis and golf will be double elimi-
nation with a two man team; and
mushball will be round-robin.

Many of the stars of last year’s
championship aggregations will be
returning to lead their teams. In

All teams entering any sport in
the Spring program should ﬁll in
entry blanks and return them to
the intramural oﬂice as soon as
possible, announces James Potts,
director of intramural athletics.
Preferably, entries should be in
before spring recess.

mushball the Newman club will
have basketballers Port and Milan-
ovich, star pitcher and third base-
man, back from their almost all-
senior team.

It will be the opposite in the case
of the Sammies, runners-up last
year, for their greatest loss is their
star pitcher, Lou Mendlow.

In the other sports PiKA will have
John Crosby back from their
Champion tennis team and Chuck
Page from their horseshoe trophy
winners.

Left-over from the Kappa Sig’s
golf team is George Dressler, while
the second place Phi Eps will have
to rebuild as Bernie Bronk and A1
Cohen have graduated.

OSU Baseball Opener Unlikely

Jumping the gun on their neigh-;~unable to engage in extensive bat-

bors, the Pittsburgh Pirates, a
veteran University of Pittsburgh
baseball team is scheduled to take
the ﬁeld this afternoon at 3 o’clock
against a strong Ohio State nine.
However, the chances that the Sta-
dium diamond will be in shape for
the game are slight.

Phys Ed Group
To Hold Party

For the last time in their col-
lege careers, the Physical Educa-
tion club seniors will hold an eve-
n_ing’s entertainment for all physic-
al education students. This time it
will be a combination bowling and

swimming party at the Recreation
Center bowling alleys and Trees
pool on Thursday evening.

The festivities of the evening
start at 6 o’clock in the bowling al-
leys, and continue until 8 o’clock.
Incidentally, this will be the only
event for which there will be a
charge.

Later at the Trees pool the swim-
mers will get a chance to show
their stuﬁ. Valuable prizes will be
given to the contest winners.

The swimming meet will start at
8 o’clock and end at 10 o’clock.

Bud Graf, Ed4l, is the general
chairman of the party. Rudy Gra-
disek, Ed4l, is the bowling chair-
man with Jimmy Klein, Ed4l, and
John Sylvester, Ed4l, working as
bowling aides.

Mary Hilda Fagan, Ed4l, chair-
mans the swim meet, and has
Florence Boney, Ed4l, Eddie Stra-

“Block that kick.”

“Shoot it to Mike under the
basket.”

No,_ it’s not Minnesota trying to
convert after making, a touchdown
against Pitt, or a Blue and Gold
clad basketball player waiting for
a pass under the Westminster hoop;
instead it’s probable that these
frantic cries are occasioned by Phi

Gamma Delta battling Pi Kappa
Alpha in a tight grid game or the
Valley Boys playing the Newman
club in a nip-and-"tuck ﬂoor contest
in Pitt’s intramural league, for the
widespread popularity of the Uni-
versity intramural steup provides
just as thrilling and blood-tingling
competition as does the varsity pro-
gram.

0 Recreational Value

After a gruelling schedule of
classes and activities, many of the
men students in the University ﬁnd
it great relaxation to make use of
the University athletic facilities in
these intramural struggles. To
meet the demands of these students
who believe in the philosophy, “All
work and no play makes Jack a
dull boy,” director of the intramu-
ral program James Potts provides
four sports during each of the win-
ter, spring, and fall seasons, so that
there is “a sport for every student
and a student for every sport.”

In addition to football, speed-
ball, paddle tennis, and badminton
in the fall: basketball, volleyball,
bowling. and table tennis in the
winter; and mushball, horseshoes,

tennis, and golf in the spring; the
department sponsors all-campus
swimming and track meets and the

_ interfraternity sweepstakes.

In the past school year in this

seventeen-event program 291 teams
entered 3309 men in three leagues:
engineering, independent, and fra-
ternity leagues. As for individual
game participation, men saw ac-
tion 8,809 different times. The ath-
letic department of the University
has provided more facilities to
meet the increased interest accel-
erated during the three year exist-
ence of this program.

0 Form New Associations

However, there are still many
students who have yet to notice
the advantages of participation in
some branch of athletics. Almost
every college man has some excess
energy that could be put to some
use. Intramural athletics not only
serve to develop new skills and im-
prove old ones, but they help men
to form new associations.

Today, in this the first of a series
of articles on the intramural ath-
letic program, an attempt was
made to discuss it in its broader
aspects. In succeeding installments
various phases will be discussed.

R. H. Heilman . . .

senior industrial fellow at Mellon
institute, will discuss the “Engi-
neering Importance of Heat-insu-
lating Materials” in Heilon institute
auditorium on Thursday morning
at 11:30 o’clock.

ting or ﬁelding drills. Due to bad
weather, the Pitt baseballers have
been forced to do most of their
work on the miniature diamond be-
neath the Stadium.

Although the starting lineup is
anything but deﬁnitely set, Coach
Mitterling has intimated that sev-
eral athletes have practically cinch-
ed their position. Guy Guadagino
is slated to be in the catching job,
Brown at ﬁrst base, Straloski at
second, Bonelli at third base, and
Goelz, Bush, and Jones in the out-
ﬁeld.

Vaiksnor Holds Edge

The departments where doubt
exists are the shortstop and pitch-
ing positions. In the former, the
battle is between Johnny Vaiksnor
and Jacobs with Vaiksnor holding a
slight edge. On the mound Mitter-
ling will choose between footballer
Bob Malloy, Wilks, and Banks.

One of the bright spots for the
Panthers is the fact that a wealth
of reserve material will be on hand
in case the regulars should falter.
Mitterling will be well supplied in
catching, inﬁeld, and outﬁeld insur-
ance. For the inﬁeld, the Panther
mentor will have lettermen Al Hol-
brook and Larry Katz, while the
outﬁeld will be strengthened by
Baker and Maccollough.

Behind the platg, Pitt has plenty
of reserve material to relieve burly
Guy Guadagnino. The presence of
Bariska, Icardi, and Joe Rettinger
should dispel. any doubts Pitt may
have concerning the potency of the
catching department.

Gamma Delta fraternity, opened
the discussion with a speech on
“The Theory of Student Govern-
ment.” Declaring that “learning
to live democratically is the chief
justiﬁcation of student govern-
ment,” Roberts outlined several
types of student government plans
in use at schools throughout the
country.

Roberts ﬁrst discussed the organ-
izational type of government, in
which the heads of activities groups
and class oiﬁcers constitute the ma-
jor student legislative group. As
opposed. to this type of student gov-
ernment, Roberts pointed out the
nonorganizational type in which
the entire legislative assembly was
elected from the student body at
large.

Combination of Types

“It is an intelligent combination
of features from both types of gov-
ernment, organizational and non-
organizational, that makes for the
best type of student government,”
Roberts declared.

“We are aiming at that type of
government here at Pitt,” he add-
ed, “but it can only succeed if that
student government has the respect
and conﬁdence of the student body.”

Following Roberts, Ruggero Aldi-
sert, C41, former independent
member of SFA, presented an an-
alysis of “SFA at Pitt,” in which he
advocated either enlarging the
scope and powers of the present as-
sembly, or else retaining its present
function and streamlining the or,-
ganization by abolishing the general
assembly, which he called “bulky
and stupid.”

Possible Functions

As described by Aldisert, the
present SFA at Pitt has no legisla-
tive functions, outside of passing
rules for social affairs, and the ap-
pointing of various -campus posi-
tions. Except ‘for these legislative
powers, SFA is wholly administra-
tive, according to Aldisert.

Possible functions which the as-
sembly could take over were the
formation of policy ‘regarding po-
litical speakers on campus, and the
designating of speciﬁc powers to
subordinate government agencies
in order’ to improve the expediency
of carrying out those functions, Al-
disert suggested.

VVelfare of Majority

“In any event,” Aldisert declar-
ed, “whether we want to change
the functions of SFA, or whether
we want to retain its present scope
and merely change its structure,
let’s stop kicking terms around,
and try to ﬁnd out just what we’re
trying to do.” -

Hobert Carroll, C43, ﬁnal speak-
er, summed up IA’s position with
regard to student government when
he said, “If student government
operates for the welfare of the ma-
jority of students at the University,
IA will cooperate with it to the
greatest‘ extent possible. If, how-

ever, that‘ -student government is .

weak, ineffective, and used princi-
pally to enhance the ego of certain
students, then IA will have to do
most of its work outside the circles.
of student government.”

Jldsks Would Enable Eds,
Coeds to Save Their Faces

. By EDITH ROSENBLATT

We see by the papers that the
ministry of health in London has
recommended face masks as an anti-
germ measure.

If that happens here, there’ll be
some changes made.

For one thing, eds and coeds
won’t be in such a hurry to elope
after a big evening. They’ll be too
worried about what the masks are
hiding.

For instance, people won’t have
to have their noses remodeled or
their teeth straightened. A man
won’t have to shave until his mask
turns the beard into a boomerang,
and large ears will be an advantage

because they’ll hold the masks bet-
ter.

The change won’t be good for lip-
stick manufacturers because girls
will ﬁgure that lipstick is a waste
of money when nobody sees your
lips anyway.

But, on the other hand, since a
girl’s eyes will be the only part of
her face that shows, things will be
looking up in the mascara business.
The ads will no longer read, “Win
him with your eyes, your most ex-
citing feature.” They will say,
“Win him with your eyes, your
feature.”

There is, however, a major dis-
advantage.
