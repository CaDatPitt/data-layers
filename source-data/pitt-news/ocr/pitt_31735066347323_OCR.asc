A Campus Police lieutenant who
was allegedly ﬁred for reasons
relating to the recent campus police
strike is presently appealing
charges of insubordination, accord-
ing to sources who wish to remain
anonymous.

Campus Police Lt. Stan Lowe was
ﬁred on charges of insubordination

by Campus Police Chief Curt
Graham on November 11, after. he
deﬁed Lt. lim Heagy’s order to split
the 12-hour night shift with two
union men who crossed the strike
lines and returned to work. Lowe,
who did not honor the strike
lines and functioned as a member
of upper management during the
recent strike, was reportedly
ordered to work four hours, while

Pih‘ Bids For Cable")

Television Station

BY MAGGIE McKAY

Pitt recently committed itself to
programming a free access televi-
sion channel, if cable television
comes to Pittsburgh. For the past
several months, Pittsburgh’s City
Council has been investigating the
possibility of a city-wide-Cable TV
system. ‘

In a meeting last October before
the Council's .Cable TV Study
‘Committee, Ray Steele, assistant to
the provost presented Pitt’s re-
quest for its own channel and

 and ﬁlmmakers.

ﬁve channels be established for
educational, governmental and
public access for the Pittsburgh
system.

The Federal Communications
Commission (FCC) regulates cable
TV and requires that cable TV
systems have at least 20 channels,
with one access channel.

The uses for cable television are
endless, according to Steele. Cable
television has been used in many
cities such as Knoxville, Tennessee

the two returning strikers were

Heagy reportedly ordered Lowe
to work from 3 a.m. to 7 a.m., while
two union members were given the

worked the entire 12 hour shift

“I refused to work the split

about the incident.

“Where is the logic that from 3
a.m. to 7 _a.m. you don’t need a
certiﬁed EMT on the ambulance?
Emergencies can happen any
time.”

According to the Campus Police
handbook, a person can be fired on
grounds of insubordination only if
the same charge was ﬁled within the
previous twelve months, sources

Jackie Sherrill, an assistant to
Johnny Majors at Pitt before
leaving for the ‘top , spot at
Washington State last December,
will be named Pitt’s replacement
for Majors as head football coach,
probably this week, according to
various reliable sources.

Sherrill was in Pittsburgh this
weekend to discuss the head
coaching job with Pitt athletic
director Cas Myslinski and
Chancellor Wesley Posvar, the two
men involved in the selection
process. “I’m being considered for
the job,” Sherrill said. “They
asked me to come here and_ talk
with some people.” ‘

Sherill attended Saturday night’s
Pitt-Virginia basketball game at the
Field House with Myslinski, then
watched‘ yesterday’s Steeler-
Tampa game at Three Rivers
Stadium with Posvar. He then ﬂew

-«to Pullman, Washinton, where he

had scheduled a meeting with his
team for _this afternoon. The
announced purpose of the meeting
was discussion of the team's
off-season weight training pro-

gram, but a new item may now
have to be added to the agenda.
“If: he did have anything to tell

‘them, that would be the perfect

time,” said Roy Neese, sports

editor of the Pullman Herald.’

“Sherrill will beﬂthere, his
assistants will be there and his

, team will be there.

“They (the Washington State:
athletic department) were scared
Sherrill might leave to take the Pitt
job,” Neese said last night. “They
made an effort to keep him. I don’t
know if they offered more salary or
recruiting money or what, but I
know they tried.” 0

In Pittsburgh, meanwhile, Mys--~
linski and Posvar were trying to”

decide. Their decision, one source
said, was not a hard one. i‘

“I’d be shocked if it isn't
announced inthe middle of the
week that Jackie’s got the job,” an

inﬂuential member of the ‘Golden '“ 

Panthers, Pitt’s alumni-booster
organization, said last night;

Bus Drivers Take To The Wheel Again

BY MARK CELENDER

Pitt commuters can rest their
hitching thumbs while Port Author-
ity Transit (PAT) drivers man their
buses today in compliance with a
court order which brought an end to
a 5-day mass transit strike in
Allegheny County.

Some of the 2,600 members of

    

Such is a sight

_.._—-*"““-\\

 

Division 85 of the Amalgamated
Transit Union met with their leaders
and agreed yesterday to obey the
court injunction handed down
Friday. A

Allegheny County Judge -Silvestri
Silvestri granted the injunction
request by PAT because, he said,
not all legally required steps were
taken to solve the negotiating
impasse before the strike.

Drivers, as public employes, are
required by state law to submit to
mediation and fact-ﬁnding before
striking. They are not required,
however, to submit to binding
arbitration.

Silvestri amended his order
Saturday to put a 10-day limit on the
injunction, at which time the state
mediator involved with. the talks is
ordered to notify the state Labor
Relations Board.

During the strike, Pitt’s Student
Government, in conjunction with
Carnegie-Mellon University, form-
ed an Emergency Carpool Com-
mittee that helped some 1,300
students ﬁnd rides into the Oakland
area, according to Student Govern-
ment Board member Benita Mar-
cus.

Marcus said the Board received
positive input from students
participating in the carpool.

‘ ‘A lot of students told us that the
carpool was their only way to get a
ride to school during the PAT
drivers’ strike,” Marcus said.

While the court injunction keeps
the buses going, it’s not likely the

 

, ‘ ‘C” for 0akland—-With the injunction levied against the bus drivers,

commuters won’t be needing these signs for at least another ten days.

Student Government will keep the
carpool going.

“Maybe some people that we
brought together during the strike
will continue making arrangements
to come to school together but I
really don’t think the Student
Government will keep up the
carpool,” Marcus said.

Marcus said if the PAT drivers
strike after the court injunction then
the Student Government will start
the carpool again.

Pitt’s Personnel Division also

Wilson photo
made an attempt to help commuters
during the strike. In conjunction
with the Golden Triangle Associa-
tion, the Personnel Department set
up a “courtesy ride” system to aid
faculty and staff (although students
could participate) in ﬁnding rides
during the strike.

Although the “C” for courtesy
ride program» was a good idea, Mary
Ann Aug, acting Director of News
and Publications said, “The old

thumb seemed to be working better ~

than the ‘C for courtesy’ signs.”

Oakland ﬁre ofﬁcials classiﬁed a
MCNR residence smoke scare
“unintentional” after responding
to a ﬁre alarm at the Lothrop street
dormitory early yesterday after-
noon.

Oakland Fire Chief C.P. Harris
said the department “always
responds to a ﬁre alarm full force
because they can never be sure if
the alarm is real or not.”

Harris said seven pieces of

equipment responded to yester-
day’s alarm.

The buildings also are always
evacuated. “We never let anyone
re-enter until the alarm system is
reset and the building checked for
smoke and ﬁre,” Harris said.

Harris also said the fire
department has been negotiating
the means for implementation of a
standard operational procedure for
evacuation of the dormitories
because of the ‘ ‘laxity of evacuation
in the University vicinity.”

ures in ﬁnding justification for the
insubordination charge, in light of
handbook regulations. While Lowe
ﬁles appeal, he remains unemploy-
ed.

According to an Afﬁrmative
Action spokesman there are three
levels of appeal.

Lowe recently took the ﬁrst step
which requires a letter be submitted
to Graham asking for justiﬁcation of P
the dismissal.

Sources report Graham refused to
justify the order of insubordination.
The second level involves submit-
ting a letter questioning the
justiﬁcatihn of a release from duty

to Vice Chancellor of Business and

Appeals Charges

As a last resort, witnesses to the
incident and an outside arbitrator
attend a hearing of the case.

Even if a justiﬁcation for Lowe's
release is provided by Graham it
reportedly would be only Lqwe’s
ﬁrst insubordinant act. ,

Sources, however, have suggest- ’

ed the handbook regulations might
be rendered invalid during a strike
situation.

Graham refused to comment on
any aspect of the Lowe case. The
case “involves internal affairs
within the department,” he said.

Lowe worked 25 years for the city
police before he came to work for
the Campus Police. 2

into high gear when the strike
called is one involving public
employees. Police, firemen,
teachers, clerks, bus drivers--while
the public has a vital stake in the
services these employees provide,
the public as employer has no
reason to expect it's employees to
settle for second-class rights.

, Pitt Parallels Corporations

. Ihave read the editorial in the Pitt
News, Wednesday, November 10,
and I must say that the University
has been paralleling the corporate
structures of the twentieth century
giants not only on this issue but also
all others I can recallwithin the past
few years.

Of necessity, '- the
background activities, such as
supplies to the labs, offices,
cafeterias, record keeping, main-
taining order, must be handled in an
orderly business manner. There

University

must be a method of assuring the

students, who are here to be taught,
that they will continue to learn or at
least have the opportunity to learn.

. However there is always a limit to

and an "extent of the reach of the

r . corporate structure and its resultant

red tape. The University at this
point has far exceeded these

. limitations.

First of all the administration
does not give a damn about the
undergraduate students. This is
readily apparent in the way
undergrads and, in some instances
graduate students as well, are
treated in discussions with adminis-
tration personnel concerning f'man-
cial problems. The campus cliche

' goes something like ‘ ‘try to get back

any overpaid money and all you get

, is a hand full of red tape”. Red tape -

does not deposit well in the local
bag‘: .

A second point is Pitt’s refusal to
give any assistance whatsoever in
alleviating the problem of under-
graduate student parking. This is
my own personal vendetta. Gradu-
ate students and profs are
guaranteed parking spaces, as well
asimost of the employees. However,

I understand there is acharge for‘.

these reservations. At another
university this would be an
atrocious, intolerable situation. The
logical question is how other

institutions»(some local) in this type_

of -area are able to show a profit and

still provide free parking for staff“

and students alike. One stock
answer is the limitations and
expense of land make consideration
of any plan of free parking for
undergrads seem euphoristic and
idealistic. The idea of a parking
garage in the center of Oakland is an
excellent one, but the projected cost
of use of this garage is ridiculous.
‘What student can afford $3.00 per
day? Is our administration geared

only to proﬁt structure? One dollar -

per day is a fair price for such a
captive market—-particularly if this
project is state funded. Why are we
funding a new law school when we
currently have sufficient classroom
and office space? In this day of
science and technology, storage for
records even at so vast an institution
as the University should prove _to be
the most minor ‘of problems.

A third point is found in the
lowering of both admittance and
_undergraduate standards. At the
undergrad level, an “A’ ’ is easier to
obtain today than was a “B” four
years ago. I believe this
deterioration of standards lies
-solely with the administration and
has been permitted with one goal in
mind-——m~onetary gain——more un-
dergraduates, additional state aid.
The administration must be aware
of the fact that as the student levels
fall so must also the teaching level.
There is -no other way for weaker
freshman to -be carried through to
the senior level. But even allowing
for increased state aid and higher
tuition (collected) levels which
together equal increased monetary
input, ‘the resulting undergrad
beneﬁts have not been forthcoming.
The fund would appear to be
channeled into an intensified sports

program, unwarranted staff salary»

increases, stepped up building
plans for professional schools.

A school is not made up of
buildings, offices and storage
areas, but rather by students and
teachers. I fear we may find
ourselves minus both soon. I rest
my case.

consumers at the same time, the

ToProfessor Ali's Style

It has been brought to my
attention that Professor Ucef Ali,
Department of Black Studies, _is
under heavy criticism for his
teaching style, his effort, and his
ability as an educator at the
University. As a result of this
innaccurate assessement of Prof-
essor Ali, his status as a University
professor is pending, until the
University comes to a ﬁnal decision
on this matter.

As a student at the University of
Pittsburgh, I have had the
privilege of taking one of Professor
Ali's courses, Black Political
Problems, Black Studies 849. It is
rare for a student to feel that taking
a class is a privilege rather than a
requirement. The reason for my
attitude is due to Professor Ali.

Professor Ali is a superb and

few professors at this university
have acquired the skill and finess
that Professor Ali has attained. My
knowledge of black political prob-
lems was negligible before his
class. This knowledge was derived
only by reading the newspapers,
watching the news broadcasts on
television, and through my own
interactions with blacks, which
were few in number due to my
racists thoughts and opinion. It
was through the abilities of

Letters: Columnist has Right to Express Opinion

Attacks Cannot Respondants Don't

Go Unanswered

While I do not unequivocally
agree with everything that Dan
Mulholland wrote in his two-part

-series on the myths of abortion, 1

cannot allow the attacks on him in
the November 17 Pitt News to go
unanswered.

First, Ken Chestek has totally
misrepresented what has happened
in the wake of the Roe V. Wade and
Doe v. Bolten decisions of January
22, 1973. While the court did not
legalize abortion-on-demand de
jure, it did say that abortion is legal
up to the moment of birth, if the
pregnancy threatens the mental
health of the mother; the de facto
application of the principle has been
so broad that a woman can have an
abortion anytime. Therefore, the
attempt on the part of many states
to restore the rights of unborn
children, even after the point of
“viability,” has been without
effect.

Second, Chestek missed the
whole point of the back that the
“back-alley” abotions have in-
creased despite the court ruling.
Since one of the chief contentions of
the anti-life ‘people (like Bonnie

V Munnell) is that legalized abortion

does away with “back-alley but-
chery," the rise of illegal abortions
exposes .a signiﬁcant ﬂaw in their
argumentation. in addition to the
“back-alley" sort, we now have the
same butchery in nice, clean clinics.

As for Bonnie Munnell’s vicious
tirade, I would normally not even
dignify it with a response were I not
appalled at the sort of dangerous
prejudice she exhibited. Why does
she single out Roman Catholicism
and not, for instance, Orthodox
Judaism (which also opposes
abortion) for her vitriolic harangue?
Because then shemight be accused
of anti-semitism. But rad-chic
pseudo-intellectual anti-Catholic
bigotry is somehow acceptable,
right? I am not surprised to hear a
bigot like Munnell espousing the
denial of civil and human right to
unborn children. By calling the

baby a “fetus” (simply Latin for .

‘‘young'‘), she attempts to dehu-
manize the child, much as the very
same Supreme Court deﬁned blacks
as non-persons in the infamous
Dred Scott decision, and as Hitler
pronounced Jews as sub-human.

But the objective biological truth of.

the matter remains; the unborn
child is unquestionably a member of
the species Homo sapiens and
possesses a unique genetic code
which no other human being will
ever have. The court may rule until
doomsday that geographic location

. (within or outside of the mother’s

womb) has something to do with
personhood; but until the pro-abor-

7 tionists deal with the fundamental

humanity of the child, born or
unborn, the pro-life movement will
not be silenced. The simple fact of
the matter is that someone dies in
an abortion, and it is not an animal
or a plant, it is a small human being.
It is the role of law in a free society to
protect the civil and human rights of
each and every person, regardless
of race, sex, class, religion.
nationality, or age. That is why,
Bonnie, I too am “insulted and
outraged”: because in a venomous,
bigoted attack, you have claimed
the right to kill.

Understand Case

Though I do not personally share
all of Mr. Mulholland’s views, I find
it disconcerting that two individuals
could respond to his article without
having first understood what he
said. Neither Mr.~ Chestek nor Ms.
Munnell Pitt News-‘——Nov. 17
actually address the substance of
Mulholland’s comments though
both agree that he is a “turkey”,
"fool", “puppet” and “dummy”
and that his arguments are “wild”,
“misinformed”, ‘ ‘irrational’ ’ and
so much “garbage.”

Mr. Chestek sought to point up
the “distortions” and “errors”
which Mulholland made. (Surely, he
says, Mulholland could not have
read the cases in question Roe v.
Wade or Doe v. Bolton.

Believe me Mr. Chestek, Dan
Mulholland has read the cases.
However, not content with a mere
literal interpretation of what the
Court said, he has studied the
impact of each and has correctly

determined that as a practical

matter abortion on demand has
become the law of the land at least

with regard to the first six months of

pregnancy.

Mr. Chestek‘s point that the
Court expressly stated in Doe that a
woman has no “absolute" right to
abortion on demand is correct but
fatuous. What constitutional rights
are absolute? The Court has for
instance said many times that the

-freedom of speech is not absolute;
does this mean that there is no
substantial freedom of speech? Not
at all.

Mr. Mulholland was also esssen-
tially. correct in saying that the
Court determined that the fetus is
not a legal person to the same extent
that the rest of us are. His reference
to the Dred Scott case was therefore
apropos: in both the Court found
that two. groups of human

=beings——the Negro and the fetus——
did not possess the full panoply of
rights accoded all others.

Ms. Munnell’s rather effusive
letter was even less responsive to
Mr. Mulholland’s article. Ms.
Munnell is a fanatic (by definition)
and fanatics, as all people who
strive to be rational know, add color
to controversies—in much the same
way asccockatoos of the Hyde Park

variety add color to any municipal
zoo.

1 am not surprised that Ms.
Munnell has difficulty grasping (if
not accepting) Mr. Mulholland’s
arguments. It is after all beyond

her “comprehension to understand

how or why you ‘iPitt News) can
allow that illogical (sic) and immoral
turkey, Moynihan (sic), to print
such garbage..." A person who
has no inkling of the extent of the
constitutional, ‘guarantee of free
speech and press will no doubt have

no difficulty rationally discussing other

fundamental rights.

There is no doubt merit in her
otherwise relevant, lucid and
compelling pro-abortion argu-
ments. Relevant because as we all
know the "government" and the
“corporate structure" (which are
synonomous) ‘ ‘have gone berserk. ’ ’
Lucid because with environmental
disaster “imminent” we (the
Human race?) are “smothering our
pain and our basic human rights to a
safe and healthyplanet." Compell-
ing because 1 too “shudder to‘ think
of the violence that wouldrise from
the rage of women’s suppression of

revoked. ' '

as enlightened people such as Ms.
Munnell rise with “anger and
indignation" to confront the
“nightmarish reality" of human
existence, and existence made more
sinister and hellish by the likes of
Mr. Mulholland, the world may yet
be saved. So long as that dreaded

psychological aberration known as

“fetus fetish" does not gain a

foothold in the human psyche man
may yet be spared the ultimate
degradation.

Who Mans TheOors,
In Boat We're In?

I would like to respond to the
grievances made by the Black
Action Society in the Pitt News
dated 11/19/76. It appears to me
that members are asking for special
privilege at this University merely
for being black. The question is
“why should blacks have any more
privilege than any other student?”
The demands they make affect most
other students here, ‘why should the
University cater to blacks only?

I M Several examples illustrate this

point.

1) Blacks are demanding the_
University make statements de-
nouncing the apartheid policies in
South Africa. However, this past
September a crisis arose when
political pamphlet distribution was
checked because state laws forbides

.a state funded university from

taking sides. Why should blacks
have this privilege when others may
not.

2) Blacks are demanding the
Campus Police be put on the line
because a “disproportionate num-
ber” of blacks comprised the
arrests made’. I highly doubtthese
arrests are made on, mere whim
rather than concrete evidence when
there are so many organizations
ready to cut down unethical
practices. Therefore, why should
blacks have the privilege of the
police answering to them.

if 3) The blacks are demanding
more black students be admitted to
fulﬁll a quota. 1 imply in this that

other students continue to follow
admissions policy. Why ‘should
blacks be granted the privilege of
less restricted admissions when
other students must still compete?

4) Blacks are demanding an
increase in the scope of the Black
Studies program. I am positive
students in other departments
would also like to see their
particular departments expanded;

and modified. Why should only ..

blacks be granted this privilege
when others are suffering at least as

much as they? A corollary to this is

the U.C.E.P. program. Why should
blacks alone have the privilege of
remedial studies (encouraged or
not) when there are other students
who also have need of these
services?

5) Blacks are demanding more
schemes to eradicate tuition hikes
because black students are being
hurt by ‘them. Why should the
University seek alternatives to
tuition hikes when all students are
affected by them. Another unwar-
ranted privilege.

In conclusion, being black
should not carry any special
privilege with it. As for the
argument that other students are
privileged, I have tried to convey
the idea that everyone, not just
blacks, are in the same boat with no
specific group manning the oars.

Student Supports, Ali

adept steering of the class, and his
ability to get at the heart of the
problems‘ being discussed in class
made the course extremely thought
provoking and a very challenging
educational experience. From his
course I was able to see my
erronious thoughts and how they
were in actuality, presenting
blacks with a very troublesome
problem.

It was through Professor Ali that
my educational experience at the
University had been advanced,
which has_ resulted in my continual

RAs Aren’t House Mothers

BY PATTY TASCARELLA‘

You're wrong if you think a
resident assistant (RA) is a variation
of the traditional babysitter, or even
an updated version of the house-
mothers in beach party movies who
preside over the dorms until
everyone rushes off to Ft.

Lauderdale. RAs at Pitt go through '

a complicated process before
qualifying as referees, analysts and
information sources.

Last year, 295 people applied for
the 79 available positions, accord-
ing to the Office of Residence Life
(ORL), and even more are expected
to apply for the 1977-1978 term
before the January 10 deadline.

The application turned in to the
ORL includes a data sheet from the
prospective RA with personal facts,
essays and recommendations. The
applicant then must attend an
informal session with a couple of
RAs to get a “peer personal view of
what it’s like to be an RA,”
according to graduate assistant
(GA) Ilene Schiowitz.

Next comes-the group evaluation
sessions where the applicant does
group exercises with fellow hope-
fuls. Then, the ORL staff reviews
the applications: some are rejected

-outright and the remainder are

scheduled for the dual discussions.
Dual discussions pair a male and
female prospective (to ‘avoid

staff, an RA and one Resident

announced in March, but _the
training is just beginning.
have a training session held the
week before school starts in
September.

‘ ‘ Pretty much, it’s ways to handle
problems that might arise,” said
RA Walt Wolfe, “roommate
problems, psychological problems
—that sort of thing.”

Wolfe said that RAs are also

‘encouraged “to a point” to serve

during freshman orientation. Also,
they are required to attend
in-service training sessions held
every other week for about an hour
and a half. _
“Usually, it’s just a lecture or a
chance .to interact,” Wolfe said.
In-service sessions can also be
taken as a course but the number of
credits received depends upon the
amount of work put into it.
According to the ORL brochure,
the RA is expected to assist the
resident student in adjusting to the
educational tasks and social respon-
sibilities of college life. He or she
must also be able to interpret
University objectives and policiesto
the student and convey student
attitudes and opinions to the

promote the development of social
consciousness to group living and

strengthen the sense of community .

on the ﬂoor. The RA is expected to
work closely with the ORL, serving
as a liaison between the office and
students. He or she is responsible
for the general welfare of the
students within the residence halls.
Any other employment is strongly
discouraged.

In return, the RA receives a
scholarship of a single room
assignment and full board plan for
the duration of employment.

‘‘It’s nice to get room and
board,” Schiewitz said, “but it’s
the other things—meeting people,
learning how to take leadership-—
that make it all worthwhile.”

To be considered for a position,
the prospective RA must fall under
the following criteria: he or she
must have senior or graduate status

for the Fall and Winter terms during -
time student j
the

employment, full
status, goodstanding with
University, and at least a 2.5 overall
QPA. Residence or related
experience is preferred, and, of
course, the RA must reside in
University Housing during the
duration of employment. I, C

CARTER MISCELLAN Y

PLAINS, Ga. (AP)——President
-elect Carter’s chief talent scout
said yesterday that John Doar and
Rep. Bob Bergland, D-Minn., are
on a list of 70 persons under
consideration for cabinet posts.

Earlier, on another matter,
Carter told reporters he has not
decided whether to broaden the
blanket pardon he has promised to
give Vietnam-era draft evaders.

“We’re trying to decide how to
word the pardon,” Carter said as he
chatted with reporters after leaving
Sunday worship services at the
Plains Baptists Church.

Hamilton Jordan, Carter’s for-
mer campaign manager who is
coordinating the search for quali-
-fied persons to fill Carter’s Cabinet,
conﬁrmed reports that Bergland
and Doar are under consideration.

“I said earlier that I shouldn’t
mention any of these names, but

I’ve just done it,” Jordan said as he ‘

1“ arrived at the Plains airport to bring

Carter the background material that

has been compiled on those being V

considered.

‘Doar, former special counsel to
the House Judiciary Committee
which voted to impreach President
Richard‘ M. Nixon, has been
mentioned as a prospect for
attorney general.

Bergland, a close political ally of
Vice President-elect Walter F.

. Mondale, has been .mentioned as

Agriculture Secretary. He operates
a 600-acre farm in Minnesota and is
an active member of the House
Agriculture Committee.

Carter was asked to comment on
reports that one of his principal
advisors, Atlanta attorney Charles

“It’s going to be done the first
week I’m in office but the different
categories of violators is something
that we're assessing.”

Carter taught the" men’s Bible
class for the first time since his
election as President and said he
hopes to continue teaching on
occasion after he joins a Baptist
church near the White House in
Washington.

“I really like to teach,” he told
reporters. “But it’s getting to be
such a news event that it’s
difficult.”

Carter’s lesson was the first in a
three-month study of the Bible’s
accounts ‘of Christmas.

Speaker Hits New Heights

WASHINGTON (AP)—When
six-foot-three Thomas P. O’Neill
takes over the House speaker’s
chair which ﬁve-foot-four Carl

_ Albert occupied for six years, there

will be more to the change than
meets the eye. 1

With no opposition in sight, the
big white-haired Massachusetts
Democrat appears certain to be
chosen for the top leadership post
Monday when the Democratic
caucus meets to organize the House
it dominates.

O’Neill, now majority leader,
appears equally certain to bring a
new style to the speakership.

Going by his record, he will be

.more outspokenly partisan, more

available to the media as a
spokesman for his party and
Congress, more willing to lay down
the law to his colleagues on
Democratic positions.

“Vacillation is always a problem
in leadership,” he once said, “but
it's not going to be mine.”

His will not be the low-key style of
Albert, who is retiring from
Congress. Albert was a leader with

a strain of person shyness and one
willing to go to extra lengths in

‘ search of consensus among Demo-

crats.

O’Neill has said:

‘ ‘I think the speaker of the House
in Congress should be like the
Massachusetts speaker, all power-

. ful. He should appoint committee

chairmen and remove them if they
stray from the party line. He should
be answerable only to the caucus,
which can remove him at any time.

“I’d throw the seniority system
out on its ear...”

That was said three years ago,
well before’ Albert announced his
retirement and while O’Neill’s own
speakership wasystill a long-range
goal. As the caucus election
approaches. O’Neill, ever conscious
that Albert is still speaker and that
as majority leader he is only number
two, has consistently refused to be
interviewed on his views of
leadership.

Moreover, O’Neill is above all a
realist, schooled in the complex
practicalities of Boston politics and
by long legislative experience,

including the speakership of the
Massachusetts House. He knows
that, while the speaker may be the
most powerful member of the
national House, he cannot, in 1977,
be all-powerful.

O’Neill, more gregarious than his

immediate predecessors, is a jolly,

story-telling 240-pounder who likes
gatherings, Irish and otherwise,
poker and golf.

He worked loyally with Albert as

, party whip and leader, punctilious

not to steal the limelight but

occasionally showing signs of‘

restiveness when decisions seemed
to be delayed.

When evidence against President
Richard M. Nixon was accumula-
ting some members were going off

on their own with impeachment

resolutions, O’Neill used his
persuasive powers to convince the
other leaders they should accept the
inevitable, forestall the hotheads
and prepare methodically for the
proceedings that led to impeach-
ment articles voted by the Judiciary
Committee.

Gino Vannelli Dollies Lamhut Dancers Add Humor
As Versatile Performer  

BY BOB PELLEGRINI

Until seeing Gino Vannelli, it’s
hardto realize that one man can be
soversatile: Jazz, rock, soul, or jyst
solid middle of the road, Vannelli
slipped in and out of each probably a
lot easier than he slipped into the
peasant jeans he wore at last night’s
concert.

The show opened with “Fly Into
This Night” a dynamic number that
set the pace for the rest of the show:
A strong driving beat, and three
sailing synthesizers.

The exclusive use of synthesizers
gives Vannelli’s back up band a.
unique sound that can be as
versatile as Vannelli’s songs. It’s
not that they’re used wrong; it’ s just
that they’re used too much and
many times they drowned out?
Vannelli’s lyrics——one of his best
attributes. A

After the opening number, the
mood was tuned down a bit with

‘ ‘Powerful People, ’ ’ a jazzy number
that featured an excellent electric

. piano solo by Bill Myers and good

synthesizer effects from brother Joe
Vannelli. 1,
Vannellilwas at his best when he
wasn’t trying to over-power the
audience with his singing and when
the synthesizers kept an active, yet
subdued role. This was shown on
what was probably Vannelli’s best
number of the night, “Gotta Keep
Walking,” which is a quiet MOR
’ piece that lets Vannelli’s lyrics
shine by themself.
With his next piece, “Where Am
1 Going,” it was back to the
obtrusive synthesizers and it was
here that Vannelli started showing

Find this one under your tree or put
it under someone else’s, and you’ll
ﬁnd refuge from your aunt’s
crummy cookies and Uncle Bert’s
football talk. ‘

As a matter of fact, that’s what
this semi-concept album is about,
refuge. In case any of you have
‘forgotten your sixth grade history
lessons, hejira was Mohammed’s
flight from Mecca_in 622 A.D. The
word has come togmean ﬂight or

Joni’s on the run again, and in ~

why the concert program claimed
that he was an “ardent student at
the Elvis Presley School of Body
English.” Because so much of his
music is instrumental, Vannelli
spends as much time dancing as he
does singing.

GINO VANNELLI

Vannelli then went through an
exercise in versatility as he changed
style from song to song. ‘ ‘Look Out
Jack” was reminiscentof the big

band sound of the Swing Era, “You ‘

Gotta Move, ’ ’ showed Gino’s ability
to do soul, with good conga back up
by Dido. Then came “Storm at
Sunup” which was a good mood
number complete with synthesized
thunder and wind.

. The worst part of the concert was
“War _Suite” which is a six song

(Continued on Page 11)

which other song-writers easily fall
into, Mitchell fashions into art.
The beauty of this album is in the
lyrics, which for her are uncommon-
ly poetic. Wandering aimless town
to town, waiting for lovers to grow
up, waiting for others to slow down,
Mitchell is more ,than effective in
bringing to life some of our more
mundane experiences. Through the
tears and the melancholy (this is a
reserved and sad record), often
emerges the cutting-edge of truth,
one of the reasons we so value her
music. '

Through the tasty nuggets of ’

words and phrases in “Amelia”
comes a lament for Amelia Earhart,
the famous aviator who vanished
from the skies over the Pacific in
1937:

“A ghost of aviation/ She was
swallowed by the sky/ Or by the sea,
like me she had a dream to ﬂy/ Like
Icarus ascending/On beautiful

.foolish arms/ Amelia, it was a false

alarm.”

Mitchell’s repetition of that last
line at the end of every verse gives
the song a haunting cohesiveness.

The title song has some
particularly powerful passages,
leaving one totally moved, if not
wholly depressed:

“Well I looked at the granite,
markers/Those tributes to finality
—to eternity/And then I looked at

 

BY DENISE DAILEY

I Ballroom dancing may never
be the same. Science fiction may
never be the same. At least for the
Pittsburgh audiences who watched
the Phyllis Lamhut Dance Com-
pany perform on Friday and
Saturday evening at the Stephen
Foster Memorial Theatre, Modern
Dance may never be quite the
same.

One reason for this is Phyllis
Lamhut’s remarkable sense of
humor, which ranges from low
burlesque to high satire, from the
ridiculous to the sublime.

Although other major ﬁgures in
choreography have parodied ball-
room dancing and the Gatsby Era
in their works, Lamhut is the ﬁrst
to have staged the idea .in
Pittsburgh. The piece which
opened their performance, Hearts
of Palm, was for many a .unique
experience.

The challenge to Lamhut’s ﬁnely
tuned sense of humor was
capturing the essense of those
classic dances, the Tango, Charles-
ton and Rumba for instance, with

» movement which has grown out of

a modern‘ perspective.
As the curtain opens slightly
overdone costumes from__the era

   

 

and the simple set of seven huge
plastic palm trees establish the

basic funny pictures.

When the dance begins, the
performers turn the scene into a
situation comedy, pushing the
choreography to its limits with
individual interpretations. Five
men, ﬁve women and a wandering
cigarette girl, all intensely in-

terested in one another and trying . 
not to show it, dance among the 

omniscient palms.

The second dance was much less
theatrical than Hearts of Palm. Solo
with the Company is a dancer’s

.dance.. In it, Lamhut does not

follow a story but experiments with

e the four basic elements of modern

dance—Shape, Motion, Space and
Time—displaying her own as well
as her dancers’ technical ability.
For this piece the upstage skrim
was raise, baring the backstage
secrets of Stephen Foster to all.

 

  

costuming, masks and certain
qualities of sound and movement.

Each dancer carried two wooden
blocks which they hit together at
various intervals throughout the
piece. This sound parallels the
accompaniment for Kabuki Thea-
tre, strengthening the Japanese
imagery, and the noise itself was a
skillfully woven thread, trying

 

J.

l

myself here/ Chicken scratching for
my immortality/ In the church they
lightthe candles/ And the wax rolls
down like tears/ There is the hope
and the hopelessness/I’ve witnes-
sed thirty years.”

“Song for Sharon” runs an
unusually long ~ 8% minutes (you
hardly notice it) and is the only track
to use backup vocals, which, I might
add, are quite potent. “Blue Motel
Room” is a standard, steamy jazz
tune: soft, torrid, drunkenly slow.
Joni doesn’t take herself to
seriously here, though, teasing on
various lines.

The music on this LP is simply
constructed. There’s practically no

acoustic guitar, as all the «songs
have a shiny, breezy sound to them
from the lightly twanging electrics.
Neil Young puts in a harmonica

‘appearance on “Furry Sings the

Blues,” which is about as
contrasted as the arrangements get.
The generally subdued music,
though, makes for good accompani-
ment to Mitchell’s lyrics. The black
and white cover goes well, too.
Hejira might concisely be des-
cribed as sides 3 and 4 of The

Hissing of Summer Lawns albums. r

But since that. might scare some of
the early Mitchell fans away, let's
just call it this Christmas’ best
musical stocking stuffer. Forget the
stocking.

oeiry

For some” this provided an"

interesting backdrop, but for the
purists in the audience it was little
more than a distraction from the
dance itself.

The setting did give rise to a
clever ending, however, when all
the lights went out leaving the
bright EXIT sign alone on stage.

The last piece on the program,
Conclave, was the most striking.
Using a sound score of electronic
music, live and recorded voices,
and the clicking together of wooden
blocks by the dancers themselves,

a variety of atmospheres was

created, all tending toward the
surreal.

Ruth Grauert’s lighting design
proved effective, as she employed
transparencies which cast different
patterns over the dancers and their
background.

The dance borrowed heavily
from Japanese theatre in its

, ; together moments which otherwise
2 if would have been small disjointed
 entities.

The choreographer incorporated
several seemingly unrelated vig-

nettes into the overall picture, most A

memorably a visit from outer space
and two freckle-faced Raggedy Ann
dolls, leaving much to the
audience’s imagination.

In the way the Japanese-
costumed ﬁgures related to the
other characters, much of the piece
created a sense of some unearthly
religious ritual.

In her thirty-odd years of
dancing,» Phyllis Lamhut has
gained recognition as a dancer
while working with some leading
dance ﬁgures as Alwin Nikolais,
Merce Cunningham and Murray
Lewis. She danced for twenty
years‘ with the Alwin Nikolais
Dance Company and has focused
on her own chorography since then.

The two performances of her
company were a cooperative effort
of the Pittsburgh Dance Council
and the Committee on the Arts of
the Student Union Board at Pitt.

During their stay in Pittsburgh
the company also provided a series
of lecture-demonstrations and

’ master classes around the city, as

part of a dance residency provided

_ by the Pittsburgh Dance Council.

I Mindless Wasteland:

Who is the Culprit?

Television is a wonderful thing.
Through this magic box we can
enjoy, in the privacy of our living
room, comedy, pathos, the admin-

Network executives tell we
TV-watchers that they give us what
we want to see: after all, Nielson
rates our predilections and these
ratings decide what goes or stays.

So, then, it is you and I who are
responsible for Lee Majors’ bionic
success and the stardom of Morris

the Cat. If these sins give us guilt, _

perhaps an appropriate, albeit
severe, punishment is to watch
more television. _
Before acting so drastically, let"s
consider that there may be

redemption. While Mr. Ed’s fame
is on our shoulders, so is Mary Tyler
Moore’s and All in the Family’s.
We can demand credit, with Gene
Rodenberry, for Mr. Spock. If these
facts do not merit pardon, they are
at least evidence for commutation of
sentence.

Television can mirror the sub-
consciousness of American society.
Archie Bunker weekly displays our
prejudices and frustrations; John-
Boy Walton shows us our struggle
for innocence; Starsky and Hutch
illuminates our enjoyment of
violence. But we do not have to

’-7‘For Pitt football fans, the answer
to; the above equation would
ajipear to be Sherrill. “lt’ll be an

said. “He is the most logical
choice.”

The’ source said Navy coach
George Welsh, who visited Posvar
and Myslinski Saturday, was not
seriously considered for the posi-
tion.

    

Not all Panthers, however, are '

anxiously awaiting Sherrill’s re;

turn. In fact, some are talking of.

leaving should Sherrill be named
head coach. _

“There are a lot of names on that
petition for Coach Sherrill,” one
Panther said, “but not as many as
everybody thinks. A few players are
talking and everybody thinks
they're talking for the whole team.
Well, they’re not. Not everybody
here wants or even likes Sherrill.

“Some people say they’11
transfer or quit if Sherrill comes,”
the player continued. “A lot of
them are freshmen, but there are

. non-commital

other people, too.

“If I had a vote in the matter, it
wouldn’t go to Sherrill. Welsh is a

 “But,” he concluded, “ifI was a

 The Golden Panther source
‘disagreed with the negativism

-~-“Continuity was the big thing

here,” he said. “Jackie Sherrill
can provide what we need.
anyone can continue what we have
here, he’s the guy.”

Myslinski, however, remaining
until the formal
announcement, declined comment
concerning whether Sherrill is “the
guy.”

v-"G

“We have our favorites,” the ’

AD said. “But we’re still at the
talkingstage. Right now, our only
worry is picking the right man for
the job.” 0

The final OK in the situation
belongs to Posvar, and right now it
appears that nod is all that
separates Sherrill from Pitt.

‘'‘If they want to get anybody
from outside, the preference would
be Coach Sherrill,” said junior
quarterback Matt Cavanaugh.

it’s a very ﬁne opportunity or I
wouldn’t take it.

“I'm also leaving something that
I think is an outstanding position
and a job that has been very

fulfilling over a four-year period.

It's a program that 1 think the Pitt
people can be proud of and a
program that will sustain itself with

. It was a thriller all the way.
The Virginia Cavaliers, led by the
ﬁne all-around play of 6-3 senior
guard Billy Langloh, edged the
Panther roundballers 62-61 at
Fitzgerald Field House Saturday
night in a game which saw the lead
change hands 14 times.

If the defending Atlantic coast

Conference champion Cavaliers
were expecting an easy time with
thefPanthers, they were in for quite
a surprise. Enjoying_their biggest
lead at 37-28 in the closing seconds
of the ﬁrst- half, coach Terry
Holland’s tall and talented troops
saw the Panthers claw their way
back into the game by virtue of a
10-2 spurt to start the second half,
with the Panthers going ahead
40-39 on a steal and driving stuff
shot by Wayne Williams.
” Even though they did wind up
short at the end, as Eddie
Scheuermann’s tip-in at the ﬁnal
buzzer accounted for the ﬁnal
margin, Head Coach Tim Grgur-
ich’s young Panthers played very
well in a high-pressure situation,
never losing their composure
against the taller, veteran Cavs.

Pitt turned the ball over only ten
times during the contest, as the
offense seemed to click for the first 5
time this year. Junior forward
Larry Harris again led the way,
scoring 22 points and pulling down
nine rebounds.

Also encouraging ,was the fact
that three freshmen, Scheuerman
(12 points, 9 rebounds), Mike Rice
(10 points) and Sonny Lewis (9
points), followed Harris in the
scoring column.

A ﬁne home crowd of 4,250

' seemed very pleased with the

Panther defense, especially in the
second half when .Virginia could.

“I thought our big guy_s
outplayed their guys inside."
Grgurich said. “It was just a matter
of us missing a layup here and
there and taking a couple of bad
shots late in the game. Hopefully»
these aspects’ of our game will
come with experience.”

Sitting in the stands of the nearly .
' deserted ﬁeld, house after the

game, Virginia star Billy Langloh
(22 points, 5 rebounds, 4 assists)
was impressed by the Panthers.
"We really didn’t expect, this
type of close game,” he said. “Our
big. man (6-10 center Otis Fulton,
out with knee problems) didn’t
make the trip, but nevertheless,
they scared us at the end. Pitt
plays as tough a defense as any

team in the ACC. They try to beat ‘

you up.”

Langloh scored 11 of his 22
points in the ﬁnal ten minutes, as
he came up with the big play time
after time. No other Cavalier
managed ﬁgures in the scoring

column, although 6-8 forward Marc V

Iavaroni and 5-10 point guard Tim

Steve Castellan, a 6-8 sophomore
ﬁlling in for the injured Fulton, led
the Cav rebounding with 12.

Polomen Go Crazy,
End Sane-tly Season

BY JIM LEWIS

If someone told you that after
only one year of varsity action a
college team would be undefeated,
nationallyranked and destined to
the NCAA ' championship, you’d
probably call him crazy. ‘

Call Miguel Rivera crazy.

Rivera, coach of the best water
polo team in the East--the Pitt
Panthers--watched his squad ﬁnish

I eighth at the NCAA ﬁnals in

California last week.

“We -impressed everyone very
much,” Rivera claimed. “We had
one of the youngest teams there.
There is only one senior (goalie
Walter _Young) in our “starting
lineup.” A

And with a young lineup, the
Panthers marched into the ﬁnals’
with hopeful conﬁdence. Unfortun-
ately, three losses shattered all
ideas of cracking the top six,
Rivera’s goal for his club.

Pitt’s". ﬁrst confrontation was-

against California at Irvine, the
fourth-pla,_ce finishers in the

. tournament (Stanford won the title).

Jorge Machicote sco/red two goals,
and.Butch- Silva and Luis Toro each
had one tally, but that was hardly
enough as Irvine cruised, 18-4.
With only two hours rest, the
Panthers were scheduled to face
Texas A&M in what was to be more
a blood bath than a. water polo
match. The game was unbelievably
physical, resulting in the loss of
Carlos Santiago (black eye) and
Tom and Mike Mere (penalty

ejections). With the loss of those

key starters, Pitt lost an 8-6 halftime
lead and fell to the scrapping
Aggies, 20-13.

‘ ‘The game got outof the hands of
the referee,’ ’ Rivera stated.

. _ “ Unfortunately, we got theworst of

it. With only two hours rest it’ s hard
to come back.”
_ But forward Machicote - came

I ‘back to score four times, followed by

Mere’s three goals, two tallies by

9 Tom, and ‘a single score in
‘ short-lived action by Santiago.

With‘ the two losses, Pitt went
into a later match with Loyola of
Chicago fighting for seventh place.
But, despite a ﬁve goal performance
by Mere, Loyola was the victor,
edging the Panthers, 12-11.

“They're not of the same

potential as we are,” Rivera said.
“We didn’t have a really great‘
performance, because a young team
like ours tends to lay down after a
game like the one against Texas
A&M. But even still, we managed a
real close match.”

It was about as close as you can
get. Loyola scored on a penalty shot
with just 30 seconds left to take the
lead, then held off three Pitt rushes
for a tie. Silva was awarded a
penalty shot moments later but
missed. The Panthers gained
control after that, however, but
again lost the ball. Finally, with just
5 seconds remaining, Santiago
gainedpossession of the ball but
missed on his shot. Loyola hung on
for the win, sinking Pitt into eighth
place.

But an eighth-place finish is
great, considering this was the very
first year water polo was a varsity
sport here.

The Panthers amazed everyone

‘by blazing through the Middle

Atlantic Conference 9 (MAC)
unscathed (17-0) and capturing not
only the Art Bonifas Memorial
Trophy given to the MAC champ,
but also taking the number-one
honors at the Easterns against such
tough competition as Bucknell,
Brown and Army. ‘

Victories over such non-
conference powers as Ohio State,
Southern Methodist, Kentucky and
Yale capped off a fantastic 19-3
campaign. ’

Crazy? No, Rivera isn’t crazy for
heralding the achievements of his
team, and is even less insane when
he predicts the promising future.

“If we can keep this team
together, we should be the best,”
Rivera said proudly. “Next year,
we will have four sophomores and
two juniors in our starting lineup,
and I am trying to recruit a real good
high school goalie.

“We're a new sport in the area,”
Rivera said, “and after showing we
are in the same class as the other top
teams, we're hoping for more
backing by the university, students
and Oakland residents. We know
we are really, really close to
bringing a national championship
here in the near future.”

An idea that isn’t as crazy as it‘
sounds.

(Continued from Pa;/613)

Chancellor and athletic director and
our football team about it.”

The reaction of the Pitt players
was mixed. Surely many of them
were disappointed to hear the news,
yet most of them wished Majors
continued success in his new
position.

‘ ‘They took it like young men and
like champions,” Majors said.
“Really like I expected them to do.
Like a lot of young men, a lot of us
thought a lot about our coach,
whether we were 11-0 or on a team
0-11. Some of them at times have
cussed me and some of them, I'm
sure, think a lot of me as I do them.

“I told them that the most
important thing right now is to put
their minds on being number one
and ﬁnishing number one. lha.ve no

. reason to doubt that they will be. If

they play the game that they are
capable of playing, I think that we
are the best team in the country and
nobody can beat us except
ourselves. ’

“Maybe there will be a few days
of adjustment, but I ﬁrmly believe,
that with the senior leadership that

we have, that they will bounce back
and be ready, because, again,
they’re ﬁghting for something a lot
more important than where John
Majors is coaching and that’s for the
national‘ championship football
team.”

Myslinski has set a deadline of
December ”21st to ﬁnd a replace-
ment for Majors, saying he had
“less than ten” candidates for the
position. The choice of a new head
coach will be up to Myslinski and
the Pitt administration headed by
Chancellor Wesley W. Posvar.
Majors said he will have no input as
to who that person may be.

Right’ now, Sherrill, ‘who was
present at the Pitt-Virginia basket-'
ball game at the Fitzgerald Field
House with Myslinski on Saturday,
appears to be one of the most logical
candidates. A member of the Pitt

 staff with Majors from 1973 to 1975,
Sherrill knows the Pitt system, the

players like him and the program
would not have to be revamped as it
would be with an “outsider” coach
with new and different ideas.
Majors, whose record at Pitt
stands at 32-13-1 and 56-43-2 for his

overall coaching career, will
reportedly sign a s1x—year contract
with Tennessee for a sum

7 considerably less than his salary

and fringe beneﬁts at Pitt.

GRID NOTES: This must be the
week for coaching changes in
college football. Besides Majors,
Darrell Royal of Texas and Frank
Broyles of Arkansas, two of the
nation's most successful coaches
resigned their posts Saturday, but
both will stay as athletic director at
their respective schools. Also, the
Miami (Fla.) Hurricanes coach Carl
Selmer, after winning only ﬁve
games in two seasons against some
of the toughest opposition in the
country, including the Panthers,
was ﬁred Friday evening.. His team
lost to sixth-ranked Houston, 21-16,
the next day to ﬁnish 3-8.

Panther tailback Tony Dorsett
and middle guard Al Romano have
been named to the 1976 Newspaper
Enterprise Association All-America
team.‘ Romano was also selected as
one of the four ﬁnalists for the
Lombardi Award for the best
collegiate offensive or defensive
lineman in the nation.

Grapplers Wined up 5th

BY JIM LEWIS

Some people might enjoy a
ﬁfth on a cold December weekend.

But with the Pitt wrestling team, ‘

that’s not quite true.

The Panthers took a ﬁfth—ﬁfth I

place in the Penn State Invitational
last Friday and Saturday--and
didn’t enjoy the taste altogether.

“We did so-so,” Head Coach
Dave Adam said. “I was hoping
for a better ﬁnish. But we did get a
lot of _ great experience. ’ ’

Pitt captured 27 team points in a

rugged ﬁeld ‘of eigh_t,,,_,beatin2 1

Michigan State (22%) and Virginia
(9) in the team race. Penn State (51)
lost the tournament in the last few
events to Lehigh (541/2), while
Clarion (33 1/2) and Navy (281/2)
edged out the Panthers for third and
fourth, respectively.

v Junior Skip Bolin was the only
Pitt champion, as hebotted up his
opponents for the 167-pound

_ Cl'OWIl .

Meanwhile, Mark Stepanovich,
Bill Bailey and Bruce» Huggler were
racking up Panther points. Bailey
;(190) took third in his weight class
as Stepanovich- (heavyweight) and
Huggler (177) stole seconds for the
Pitt cause.

Huggler could have won his class
championship, if it weren’t for a
shoulder injury he suffered in his
very ﬁrst bout. Deemed unble to
go on by Adams and his staff,
Huggler had to forfeit his cham-
pionship match to Jerry White of
Penn State, thus placing him on the
injured list with other key
starters—Rande Stottlemyer (All-
American 134-pounder), Greg
Soergel (134) and co-casualty of the
tourney Bill Clark (118), to name a
few.

Hopefully everyone will be well
in time for next thursday’s home
meet against the Atlantic Coast
powerhouse Maryland Terrapins.

“We’re very young and inexper-
ienced,” Adams said, being
relistic. “But we gained a‘lot of
insight into what it will take to be
good. At times, we would lapse
about 20 seconds in a match and
lose. If we eliminate the mistakes
we will have a pretty good team.”

A team good enough to beat the
tough ‘Terrapins? Well, that

depends on whether the Panthers
distill several] different phases of
their game.

First, if Pitt can lasso all of the
hustle and aggressiveness it
displayed last weekend (‘‘I was
pleased with our squad’s hustle
and aggr_essiveness—-we had great
hustle,” Adams commented), and
combine it with the ﬁne condition-
ing on par with any of the other
seven teams at University Park),
and then perform almost er1’orless-
ly, the Panthersiwill deﬁnitely give
Maryland ﬁts.

But Adams isnit tremendously
worried about his team’s show-
ing—-—perf'ection is something, that
will be emphasized in practice.

What Adams is concerned about is
the turnabout at the match.

“A good student turnout would

be a big asset to us,” Adams said,’ ,

“and they would see some good," ‘ Q

aggressive wrestling. ’ ’

Last year, fans ﬂocked to the last
couple of matches of the season,
and at times attendance grew to
more than 2,000 at a home meet.
As a matter of fact, the screaming
crowd may have been a factor in a
come-from behind must-win
against Lock Haven, 24-21», which
kept the Panthers’ hopes alive for
the Eastern Wrestling League title.

A similiar crowd could enhance
Pitt’s attacking, adrenalin-ﬂowing
style and be the difference between
a win or loss.

If everything does flow together,
the Panthers could drive the
Terrapins to drink.

It’s All Foreign Affairs At

BY DAVE McDONALD

The National Collegiate Athletic .

Association’s cross-country champ-
ionships at North Texas State
proved to be another dual meet
between the Western Europeoan
countries and Kenya, with the
latter again coming out on top. The
Kenyans from Washington State
took ‘first and second place
individually and the entire Kenyan
team from the University of Texas
at El Paso (UTEP) took the team
title with 62 points.

Freshman Henry Rono from
Washington State beat his team-
mate Samson Kimombw_a by ten
seconds to take the individual title
in a fast 28:06 for 10,000 meters (a
little over 6 miles).

Rono had to communicate by way '

of an interpreter to get his splits of
the race, which were 1:57 at the
halfmile, 4:17 at the mile, 9:00 for
two miles and a blazing 13:20 for
three. -

Pitt’s Mel Boyd was well in the
top forty behind the leaders at the
four mile mark with times of 2:04 at
the halfmile, 4:26 for the mile, 9:15

at two miles and 14:15 for three. I

after that it was an uphill battle for
Boyd due to a runner’s worst
enemy, the stomach ‘cramp. The
last three miles were the ‘ ‘Agony of
defeat” for Boyd, but he did
manage to ﬁnish in the middle of
the race in 143rd place with a time
of 30:20. \

Ten of the top 25 ﬁnishers who
earned All-American status were
from foreign lands, coming mostly
from Kenya, Ireland and England.

After Rono-and Kimombwa and
UTEP there were a few notable
American runners. Last year's ﬁrst
place ﬁnisher, Craig Virgin of
Illinois, ﬁnished third after. being
burned out by the Kenyans.

Oregan ﬁnished second in the
team standings with freshman
Rudy Chapa pacing his team with a
9th place ﬁnish in 28:49. Chapa
was closely followed by seniors
Greg Meyer of Michigan and
George Malley of Penn State, who
ﬁnished 19th and 20th respectfully.
Penn State ﬁnished in 13th place as

Stetler Earns Pitt Title 1

BY JOHN FINN

Thank God for easy practices,
swim goggles and Kathy Stetler!

What is Kathy Stetler doing in a
list such as that? ,

Well, the sophomore from
Oakmont led the Pantherette
swimmers to the 1976 Pitt
Invitational Relay championship
Saturday at Trees Pool.

Pitt defeated a ﬁeld of eleven
teams that included such power-
houses as Indiana University and
Clarion State. But the big story was
Stetler, who anchored three ﬁrst-
place relays to help assure Pitt the

« meet title.

It was an impressive beginning
for the young Pantherette squad, as
Pitt set meet records in two events.

It was Stetler teaming up for a
meet record with Christy Elston,
Susan Guyer and Nila deJesus in
the 400-yard medley relay with a
blazing‘ 4:11.65.

‘Later, it was Stetler again, this

Bowlers Out On
Strike, Lose 3

BY JERRY VILLELLA

The Pitt bowling team, which has
shown ﬂashes of brilliance at times
during its season, did an about-face
last Saturday, losing all three
games of a match against Washing-
ton, Pa.

Trouble hindered the Panthers
from the start of the day, as they
had difﬁculty even in ﬁnding a
parking space on the W&J campus.
As it turned out, they might have
been better off if they hadn't found
one.

The team had problems adjust-
ing to W&J’s lanes, which were
plagued throughout the match by
breakdowns. A lane malfunction in
the first game delayed play for half
an hour, but the rest did Pitt little
good as they dropped the first
game, 883-800.

In the second game, the young
Pitt team appeared to overcome its
jitters and assume a conﬁdent,
solid pace. By the sixth frame they
had built a slight lead over W&J,
and it looked as though the game,
and the rest of the match, would be
well-fought. However, the next
two frames were a baffling,
simultaneous collapse of the
Panthers as W&J turned the
momentum around. Unable to
convert simple spares, the Pan-
thers were suddenly and decisively
overwhelmed, 905-801.

A third-game rally has been
characteristic of the Pitt squad this

. year, but it was nowhere to be

found.

time with Jennifer Price, Sandy
Moran and Judy Heretick as the Pitt
800-yard freestyle relay team broke
a record, ﬁnishing in a fantastic
8:10.19.

Aside from the record-breaking
performances, the Pantherettes
placed first in four of twelve events
and missed a ﬁfth ﬁrst-place ﬁnish
by two-tenths of a second.

Going into the ﬁnal event--the
800-yard freestyle relay—Pitt and
Penn State were tied for the team
title with 88 points each. Penn State
grabbed an early lead in the event
and after 600 of the 800 yards, it
looked as if the Lionesses would
swim away with the championship.

Enter Kathy Stetler. And before
it was over, the strong Pitt
sophomore ‘had caught and passed
the final Penn State swimmer, thus
giving the Pantherettes the ﬁnal
event and the meet.

Price and Elston, in addition to
being members of the 800-yard

- freestyle and 400-yard medley relay

teams, respectively, participated on
another winning foursome as
well—the 400-yard freestyle relay
—with Dianne Kluglein and( you

guessed it) Stetler. As a matter of’ '3

fact, the only winning relay team
Stetler wasn't on was the graduated,
relay, which was amply ﬁlled with
such talents as Lisa Jarvis, Guyer,
Jamie Conley and Moran.

Pitt’s divers placed second in
both the one- and three-meter
competition. Representing the
Pantherettes in the one-meter
diving were Jenny Brooker and
Linda Hamner. Connie Heister and
Cindy Ferraro combined , for a
second-place ﬁnish in the three-
meter diving.

The Pantherettes qualiﬁed for the
ﬁnals in all but three of twelve
events while amassing 102 points.

Pitt’s next meet will not be until
January, but after Saturday’s
performance, the women swimmers
have a lot more to look forward to
than just Christmas.
