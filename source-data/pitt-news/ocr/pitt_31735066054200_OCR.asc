Republican Vice Presidential hopeful Jack Kemp rallies supporters at the
”Celebration of Family” at Point State Park last Sunday.

"Be cool . . . but care."

Russ Krebs

   
 

_The a political rally for
Presidential hopefuls Bob Dole and
Jack. Kemp at Point State Park was
the closest that Pittsburgh will
come to having Lollapalooza this
year. The only difference was that
this gathering of an estimated
10,000 people was to support the
"Republican ticket.

The rally/concert on Sunday,
Aug. 18 was billed as “A
Celebration of Family,” and family
was exactly what the day centered
around,

The event started about 15 min-
utes after the scheduled kickoff
time of'2 p.m. with a jazz band
made up of family members. Then a
new family joined them — a family
of gospel singers. They sang the
praises of God and about the fami-
ly.

When they were done, a full-

blown gospel choir took the stage. .

They were clad in theirchoral robes

 Pitt raises tuition by 4.5 percent

4 Y
3 Ben Jackson .

Students returning to the

V University of Pittsburgh this

, fall will find that their tuition

l has gone up 4.5 percent,

' unless they are in the School
,4 of Engineering.

': f On July 19, the executive

'0 committee of the board of

   

    
    
       
   

  

et for fiscal year 1997.
vncluded in the budget was
 he tuition increase and an
 increase of 3.5 percent in the
salary pool.
 Along with those increas-
es the budget includes a $6
 million reduction in the base
_ compensation. The base com-
pensation 'includes such
things as salaries and fringe
benefits for University
employees. The University

  

     
 
       
       

     

 

rustees approved Pitt’s bud--

 

plans to reduce this through
layoffs as well as attrition,
which means they will not
hire new employees to
replace everyone who-leaves.

The tuition increase
means that an in-state student
in the School of Arts and
Sciences will see his tuition
rise from $5,184 to $5,416.
The most expensive under-
graduate school is the School
of Pharmacy, whose tuition
will rise from $7,632 to
$7,974.

The School of
Engineering did not increase
its tuition because of compet-
itiveness, according to Art
Ramicone, director of the
University’s internal audit
department. Their tuition was
frozen at $6,316 last year,
and the plan is to keep it at
that level until other schools’

tuition catches up to Pitt. ’

Tuition rose primarily
because Pitt did not receive
the appropriation "increase
that it had asked for from the
Commonwealth. Pitt asked
fora 6 percent increase over
the appropriation it received
last year.

The state approved a 1
percent increase, after initial-
ly planning to hold it at last
year’s level. This increase
came out of a reduction in the
State Employee Retirement
System. The system handles
all retirement funds for Penn
State, and because of the
reduction, Penn State 9
received a small increase. In
order to maintain parity, the
State gave Temple and Pitt a
small increase in their appro-
priations.

outside. Again, this group sang of
family and religious themes.

Then the jazz band was sent
back up to play a few more songs.
While they played, an unexpected
and unwelcome part of the rally
took place — the mosh pit. Several
Clinton—Gore supporters stormed
the rally from the back of the park
causing mass confusion, pushing
and shoving and verbal conflict.

The confusion ceased, by the
time the first political speaker took
the stage. The mosh pit even ended,
although a war of chants and sign-
raising continued.

Senator Rick Santorum was one
of -the first major political players
to take the stage. He spoke of the
need in America for a strong, moral
leader l.ike Bob Dole. He said, “We

Ex-president of South Korea
sentenced to death by court  

Across the Nation

LOS ANGELES — Taking the lead in a
nationwide push to enact tougher sex-
crime laws, the California Legislature
has all but completed action on what
legal experts say is the most punitive
child molestation measure ever adopted
in this country, one that would require
“chemical castration” of repeat offend-
ers.

The measure is expected to receive
ﬁnal passage this week after minor tech-
nical modiﬁcations and then to face con-
stitutional challenges. It mandates that
any offender convicted twice of child
molestation be periodically injected after
release from prison with a drug that
inhibits sex drive, unless the offender
voluntarily submits to surgical castra-
tion.

A first-time offender would also be
ordered to undergo chemical castration,
or to voluntarily submit to the surgical
alternative, should the court that tries
him ﬁnd the first offense sufﬁciently
egregious. The New York Times

' SMITHTOWN, N.Y. — Salvage work-

But they added that investigators
still do not have enough evidence to label

Divers continued to scour the west-
ern part of the crash site, containing the

airplane, for the few remaining bits and

CHICAGO — The Democrats met to
nominate President Clinton for a second
term with a program that featured not
politicians but a series of speakers telling
personal parables of tragedy and tri-

going further even than the Republicans
did two weeks ago, in their drive to
transform what once was a political gath-

WASHINGTON — While the Clinton

that China is secretly helping Pakistan
build a factory to produce medium-range

The factory is the latest of several
weapons control disputes to arise with
China in recent years and American law
could require the imposition of econom .
ic sanctions. But senior ofﬁcials have n; 
appetite for another confrontation wi_ 
China, especially in an election year it

While y’aI were out...

, .
Cesca A onelll


   

In the warm, sun-filled days of
summer, the lazy hand of time slows‘
until the pace of life seems to move
along at a crawl. But while students
were lounging on sandy beaches, sip-

p ping their sodas, and catching some

, rays, Pitt didn’t stop to rest, but made

1 sweeping decisions about policies and
practices.

So as students prepare return to

‘ the hurry and the homework, The Pitt

News presents what happened while

they were out.

On‘ April 30, Pittsburgh City
Police arrested eight people on drug
-charges after raiding Pi Lambda Phi,
an off—campus fraternity house on
North Dithridge Street. Police entered
the house with a search warrant for
drugs and left with six students and
two others on charges of possession of
narcotics.

Robert Todd, a member of the
Inter—Fratemity Council, was charged
with intent to distribute narcotics. The
others, IFC President Lee Malkiel,
Michael Kushner, Brian Arpin, Becky
Budziszewski, Justin Solomon, Sandra
Flinchbaugh, and Kristopher Wiegand,
were charged with possession of nar-
cotics.

I Marijuana, cocaine, and heroin
were among the illegal drugs seized
from the house. Valium, Prozac, and
other prescription drugs were also
confiscated.

The preliminary hearing was

I waived, and arraignment has been set
for October 2. Pitt is also conducting

‘* an investigation into the fraternity.

The Pi Lambda Phi incident was .

the first of many fraternity woes this
summer to meet with harsh criticism
from University and public officials.
Also in May, the Office of Student
Affairs revoked Pi Kappa Theta frater-
nity’s charter for one year for alleged
involvement in a hazing incident. Pitt

>--I revoked Phi Gamma Delta fraternity’s

charter for an alleged hazing incident

 ast fall that sent one pledge to the hos-

; ital for alcohol poisoning. In June,

Pitt revoked Alpha Epsilon Pi’s charter

until January 1998, after the fraternity

was found guilty of violating the
_ University’s anti—hazing policy.

_ Also in June, four Kappa Alpha

pf Psi brothers were ordered -to stand trial

I‘ on charges related to a hazing incident

X that occurred in March. Of the five

 members originally charged, Timothy

5 Jones, Eric Cofield, Daymon A.

; Williams, and Milton Robinson will

; be charged with two counts of aggra-

I vated assault, two counts of reckless

‘ I endangerment, and a count of conspir-

    
 
 

, acy.

Jones is a current Pitt student, and
the other three have all been students
at various times. Charges against Iman
Jones, a recent Pitt grad, were
dropped. The trial date has been set for
February 18.

In response to these incidents and
increased scrutiny of fraternities
across the nation, Pitt adopted a num-
ber of recommendations to overhaul
the Greek system, including signifi-
cant changes in the pledging system,
Greek academic standing, and the bat-
tle against alcohol abuse.

Greek administration changes
weren’t the only new policies institut-
ed by Pitt this summer. In May, the
Senate Council voted to recommend a
revision in the policy on student—facul-
ty relationships to Provost Maher. The
revision does not prohibit relations

between faculty and students, but it .
demands that the faculty member I

remove herself from supervising or
evaluating the work of the student she
is involved with.

In June, Senate Council President
Keith McDuffie announced that Board
of Trustees Chairman J .W. Connolly
planned to recommend to the Board
that students, faculty, and staff be
eliminated from Trustee committees.
At the June meeting of the Trustees, a
vote was taken to look into other
avenues of student involvement before
any decision to eliminate any commit-
tee members was made. If such a deci-
sion is made, Chancellor Mark
Nordenberg would be the only repre-
sentative of student, faculty, and staff
concerns to the Board.

In July, the Board of Trustees stu- I

dent affairs committee voted to form a
committee to look into the possibility
of exempting, medical school students
from the student health fee. These stu-
dents are required to pay $800 for
insurance in order to attend med
school and another $115 to Pitt for the
fee. These two charges cover the same
services.

And in addition to all this, Bruce
Cabbagestalk, the 16-year-old accused
of shooting Kevin Cecil last July, pled
guilty to attempted murder, aggravated
assault, robbery, conspiracy, and car-
rying an unlicensed firearm. Leon
Haley resigned as vice chancellor for
student and public affairs to return to
the Graduate School of Public and
International Affairs. Pitt approved its
budget and increased undergraduate
tuition by 4.5 percent, and the College
of Arts and Sciences approved sweep-
ing restructuring plans that include the
addition of three new associate deans.

Pitt begins new 81 1 emergency phone service

Sannon _F|uck

 

Beginning in September, Pitt stu-
dents will have a new way to reach the
campus police headquarters. There will
be an 811 emergency service line avail-
able on all campus phones. '

This new security service is a
direct expansion of the emergency
phone boxes located throughout cam-
pus. Calls from both emergency
phones and standard University phone
lines will be directed to the Pitt
Police’s main station, located in the
basement of Forbes Quadrangle.

. The emergency phone system was
designed to be very easy to use,
according to Sgt. Charlie Grier of the
Pitt Police. Grier said the caller doesn’t
even have to speak into the phone to
get help. He said the dispatcher who
answers the call can determine where
the person is located through a tracking
system and can send an officer imme-
diately.

The emergency phone boxes, near-
ly 300 in number, were installed in the
1970s. They had already existed at sev-
eral large, urban universities. Grier
said that there was growing concern

about street crime at many city-based.

universities. He said that most of. the
emergency phones are located outside,
on the streets, for this reason.

 

“If someone is out in Oakland on a
Friday night and they see two groups
of people arguing, they can call us,”
said Grier. “Hopefully, we’re there
before it escalates into a more serious
situation.”

The new 811 service will be
installed on every campus phone,
increasing students’ access to emer-
gency assistance. This means that
every dorm room, classroom building,
and library will be
connected.

Pitt Police Chief
Rick Boyd said he
hopes the new three-
digit number will save
time for those in need
of assistance and that
it will be easier for the
students to remember.

“We would have
used 911, except the
university has its own phone system,”
said Boyd. “It’s built into our system
that you dial nine to get off campus, so
calls to 911 may have gotten mixed

up.”

Boyd said that students need not
worry about an increase in their tuition
or security fee.

“The telecommunications depart-
ment here at Pitt  recently upgraded
their equipment and could offer us sev-
eral enhancements,” said Boyd. “It’s

 

 

 

not going to cost the University or the
students a dime.”

The students seem to favor this
new service and think that having
access to emergency assistance, espe-
cially in their dorm rooms, will give
them more security.

“I think it’s a great idea,” said
Jenna Markle, a 21-year old Pitt stu-
dent. “Sometimes in the [Litchfield]
Towers, especially on weekends, you’d
see somebody walking
around who didn’t
look familiar, like they
didn’t belong there. It
would be great to be
able to call the campus
police to report them
without having to
leave your room.”

Other students
think that the three
digit number will be‘
more convenient and easy to use.

“Yeah, I could’ve used that number
a couple of times,” said Jack Kerrigan,
another Pitt student. “I remember once
I saw a fistfight going on outside my
window. I didn’t know what number to
call though. I didn’t even know who to
call.”

Grier also said that he was very
optimistic about the expanded emer-
gency service. He said that the
University has received a lot of posi-

tive comments over the years from stu-
dents regarding the accessibility of
Pittsburgh’s campus police.

“Each officer is assigned a particu-
lar portion of the campus, 24 hours a
day, 365 days a year,” said Grier.
“Whether it be ﬁre, medical, assault, or
just suspicious activity, someone is
always nearby to check it out.” p

In response to the popularity of
911, many other universities have
installed similar emergency phone
lines. Michigan State University
recently adopted a 911 phone line,
although they had been using a differ-
ent three-digit number for nearly 20
years.

“We always had emergency calls
ring directly to our dispatch,” said
Susan Putnam of the Michigan State
police. “But we would have to call East
Lansing to get an ambulance or fire
truck dispatched, so we switched to
911.”

Despite the increased convenience
students will have with this emergency
line in the fall, neither Boyd nor Grier
think that there will be a problem with
prank calls. Grier said the records
show there have been “very few”
delinquent calls over the past few
years.

“The biggest challenge will be to
get the word out,” said Boyd. “To get
people used to using that number.”

Resignatio propts
restructuring of FAS

l’ M CI d

     

On June 11 in the Campus Update,
Provost Maher decided that the
Faculty of Arts and Sciences, which
includes the College of Arts and
Sciences, will undergo a series of
changes in its administrative structure.
Maher made the decision to replace
the current administration with a
model suggested by the ad hoc com-
mittee.

“The main impetus for this

5 [restructuring] was the resignations of
Dean Briscoe, of the College of Arts
and Sciences; and Dean Soffa, of grad-
uate studies,” said Peter Koehler, dean
of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.

“Provost Maher took this opportu-
nity to institute a review of the struc-
ture of Arts and Sciences in an effort to
make it more clear as to what the
reporting lines were and also in an
effort to put some more faculty consul-
tation into the decision-making,”
Koehler said.

The functional model requires a
dean who is assisted by three associate
deans of undergraduate studies, facul-

\L

research.
The- divisional model would

' require one dean assisted by three

associate deans of humanities, social
sciences and natural sciences.

“They considered [the divisional
model] and mentioned it as a possibil-
ity, but they gave reasons why that
wasn’t such a good idea,” Koehler

. said. “Many of the interdisciplinary

activities that we like to encourage
would suffer because you had another
boundary to go through.”

Koehler will have full responsibil-
ity for the administration of all arts and
sciences programs at the University of
Pittsburgh, ‘including the College of
Arts and Sciences, the graduate pro-
grams in arts and sciences, and all
departments of the Faculty of Arts and

f Sciences. He also holds the power to
hire the associate deans.

. J Koehler began his appointment as
the dean of the Faculty of Arts and

nj ciences at Pitt in 1986. With the

V ppointment of the associate deans, he
; hopes to pick up his teaching of fresh-
; lman physics in the future.

J “A lot of careful thinking ‘went

I ' [into [the restructuring]. It means
I [among other things that I’m going to

be working very closely with Dean
,Koehler and the other associate deans,
5 and that to me is very attractive,” said

]David Brumble, associate dean of
,5 undergraduate studies. “We’re going

1-, to be working closely together. We’re

«I
t

. V
’ Q

 

ty affairs and graduate studies and

 

going to be talking together on a much
more regular basis and that means
there’s going to be better coordination.
On the whole, I’m optimistic.”

Each of the associate deans will
have major responsibilities for certain
aspects of the arts and sciences. As the
associate dean for undergraduate stud-
ies, Brumble will have to decide and
propose the number of undergraduate
students which should be added to the
arts and sciences every year.

“Brumble will make a proposal to
this group saying, ‘this is what I think
is an appropriate number of undergrad-
uate students.’ And we will discuss the
aspects of that. Then we will make a
decision, ‘this is how many students
we will aim for,”’ said Koehler.

Brumble must regulate the accep-
tance of those students, and then work
with the department chairs to translate
the number of students to the instruc-
tional offerings needed in order for the
students to satisfy their requirements

“I wanted people who distin-
guished themselves as faculty. I want-
ed people who had really shown them-
selves to be very good in all areas. And
I think I found that in each of the three
associate deans,” said Koehler. “I
wanted them to have an appreciation
for the whole range of disciplines that
the arts and sciences span. They have
to be willing to help me make choices.
I wanted individuals who could inter-
act well with other people. Also, they
have to be respected as faculty mem-
bers. And because we have to work as
a team, they have to be team players.”

Dean Koehler proposed to FAS

council that professors Kathleen
Dewalt (anthropology). David
Brumble ,(English), and Frank

Giarratani ‘(Econor_nics) be chosen to
fill the associate dean positions.

The FAS council reviewed and
interviewed each professor and the
nominations were accepted. On
September 1, the associate deans will
begin their appointments, each of
which will last for three years.

“We have also re-organized the
staff that supports the advising center
in Thackeray hall, the CAS dean’s
office in Thackeray hall, the graduate
office in the Cathedral, and my own
office,” said Koehler. “What we’ve
done is reshaped these four offices into
essentially two offices.”

’ One of them provides graduate
and undergraduate student services
and will be located at Thackeray Hall.

A mapping team was formed to
‘investigate the student services and the

Pitt’s total appropr.iation
amounts to $148.6 million.

“In light of the competing
demands presented to the State
Legislature and the governor, we
are grateful for the 1 percent
increase in our appropriation,”
Chancellor Mark Nordenberg said
in a prepared statement. “However,
that increase will be more than off-
set by the rising costs of operation
and almost certainly means that
Pennsylvania will rank among the
bottom five states in terms of per
capita support of higher educa-
tion.”

A Tuition also rose because of
general inﬂation costs and initia-

tives to improve undergraduate 0'

education at Pitt. Also included in
the cost are funds for making vari-
ous improvements in the physical
layout of the University.
Investments in technology and pro-
grams for undergraduates make up
a large part of the costs.

“This is the first year we sepa-
rately carved out money for these
things,” Ramicone said. “We set
aside $1.25 million for student
quality of life initiatives  such as
wiring the dorms for computers. All
of these things cost money.”

The total budget has projected

expenses totaling $838.6 million.
The balance of this money goes pri-
marily into the University’s endow-
ment. This money is invested in
bonds and equities, Ramicone said,
and provides for such things as
departmental chair awards for pro-
fessors ‘and scholaiships for stu-
dents.

.,which needed to be resolved before
funds were redistributed.

“RSA disbanded because it did-

This fall, RSA will be restruc-
tured. Elections will be held in the
fall, which opens the doors for
incoming freshmen and offers the
opportunity for students to begin
the year with new officers. Anyone

 living in the residence halls is auto-

, officers elect the executive board,
i which has a president, vice presi-

dent, treasurer and secretary.
Despite the efforts at restructur-
ing and reorganization of RSA how-
ever, student support and commit-
ment must be on hand throughout

J the year in order to keep that orga-

nization intact. According to
‘ Lauren Leiter of the SGB, prior to
,RSA disbanding, students seemed

uninterested in running for the

é elected positions.

I For the most part, RSA’s main-
stay is supported by various

Recent resignations spur
search for replacements

Benjamin Jackson

 

. 

 

Recent resignations have
forced Pitt administrators to
search for replacements for two
major positions in the University.

The hunt for a new dean of the
Katz School of Business has
begun again, despite the fact that
three finalists were named by the
search committee last April.

The finalists were Dana
Johnson, dean of the Calloway
School of Business at Wake
Forest University; Robert
Forsythe, the associate dean of
faculty development at the
University of Iowa; and James B.
Dworkin, the associate dean of
Krannert Graduate School of
Management at Purdue.

None of the finalists were
selected for the position and a
new search will begin in
September. '

Provost Maher declined to say
why a clean was not selected from
the finalists. He said the search
was re-opened in an attempt to
draw a wider pool of applicants.

Currently, Andre R. Blair is

THE PI'I"I' NEWS

serving as the interim dean. He
has been in that post since July 29
and will continue serving until a
new dean is selected.

The administration is also
currently looking for a replace-
ment for Dr. Leon Haley, the Vice
chancellor of student and public
affairs.

Haley, who served in that post
since September of 1994,
announced his resignation effec-
tive August 1.

Haley will remain with the
University as a faculty member in
the Graduate School of Public
and International Affairs where
he ‘served as an acting dean from
1984 to 1985. He will also be
working with the chancellor’s
office assisting with community
outreach initiatives.

While the search to fill
Haley’.s position is conducted, Dr.
Robert Gallagher, an assistant
vice chancellor for student affairs
and director of the University
Counseling Center, will serve as
an interim vice chancellor.

Pitt physicists receive $420

{Ch/Iorisse E Merchant

This past June, Provost James

, V. Maher of the University of

Pittsburgh was awarded a grant of
$420,000 by NASA, allowing Pitt
to be one of the first in ground-

scientists on Earth to know how liq-
uids will react when mixed so that
machinery can be built accordingly.

have varying densities.

The grant,

years, can be

and time is needed.

“Pitt is the only school doing
such research, although NASA
awarded many grants to other uni-
versities,” Maher said.

Maher believes if his research is
successful it could allow Pitt to
receive grants in other academic
areas. '

Before the guests of honor at the
rally took the stage, Governor Tom
Ridge talked about how great lead-
ers always make right choices. He
also instructed the crowd to
“Unleash the potential of a de1noc—
ratic government by electing Dole
and Kemp,” before his introduction
of the candidates.

When Bob Dole, Jack Kemp and
their wives took’ the stage, the
crowd erupted. Chants of “Dole-
Kemp” and “Clinton-Gore, gone in
four” ra11g out over and over. A sea
of bobbing campaign signs ranging
from the rhetorically—conservative
“Dole—Kemp in ‘96” to the more
flamboyant “I think, therefore I
vote Republican” and “Dole and
Kemp — the Billy Busters” ﬂooded
the crowd in a wave of color.

The candidates and their wives
smiled and soaked up the fervor
before getting to the task at hand —
rallying speeches. '

Jack Kemp was the first to take

- the stage.

“This time we are the democrats
(with a small “d”) and they are the
elitists. We believe in people. Bob
Dole believes in you. We’re on the
side of the people and that is what’s
going to make a difference in
1996,” Kemp said.

It already seems to have made a
difference in the race. Since the

Republican Convention, Dole and
Kemp have gone from being more
than 20 percentage points behind
Clinton to being only 6 to 9 percent
behind in most polls. In fact, a
Newsweek poll showed them merely
two percentage points behind the
president — a virtual dead heat.

“We believe that restoring the
American Dream is our greatest
task going into the 21st century,”
Kemp said.

Kemp also spoke of
Democrats criticizing his
Dole’s proposed tax cuts.

“It’s your money, you earned it
and saved it,” Kemp said. “They
don’t seem to remember that John F.
Kennedy both cut taxes and bal-
anced the budget while he was in
office — it is possible.”

Finally, Bob Dole took the
stage. Once again, the crowd erupt-
ed in cheers and chants. The “plain
speaking man from the plains of
Kansas” would finally speak to his
people.

Dole started off his speech by
talking about a comment that had
been made earlier about his wife’s
speech during the convention.
“Elizabeth is so talented that
Eleanor Roosevelt contacts her,”
Dole said.

Dole quelled many of his elder
naysayers by addressing the
Medicare and Social Security con-

the

troversy. “We’re going to balance
the budget without cutting Social
Security and Medicare. If you are a
senior citizen, you will be protect-
ed,” Dole said.

He went on to talk about his
proposed 15 percent tax cut, how
we now have the slowest-growing
economy in the past century, cutting
down on the drug problem in our
country, no parole for violent crim-
inals, and appointing judges who
know the Constitution.

Even though he had been criti-
cized for his condemnation of
teachers’ unions at the convention,
Dole still talked about teachers.
“Let me be clear. I’m on the side of
the teachers,” Dole said. “I’m not
on the side of labor leaders who try
to direct the teachers. It’s time to

take education from the hands of_

the unions and give it back to the
teachers.” .

Dole then talked of repairing
the morale of the military, saying,
“I will make the decision if we are
to send our troops overseas — not
Boutros Boutros-Ghali.”

Bob Dole also welcome voters
from all parties to embrace his cam-
paign.

“I would say to Democrats and
Independents in Pennsylvania: We
are the Reform party in America. I
say to Perot supporters: Come to us.
We are the true Reform party,” said
Dole.

He talked of making govern-
ment smaller and said that President
Clinton wants to keep enlarging
government inﬂuence. “Bill Clinton
trusts the government. We trust the
people,” Dole said.

Then came the end to
Pittsburgh’s Republican-palooza.
Fireworks, balloons and streamers
shot everywhere as the candidates
went to shake the hands of the faith-
ful and sign their campaign osters.

In closing, Dole spoke 0 all
the promises that President Clinton
made before being elected. He
spoke of how many of them were

them. “We’re going to veto Bill

Students ﬁnd
international exposure

i

an}

in the William Pitt Union

:_|_.isa McC|endon

You could learn the secrets
behind cooking an authentic
Italian meal. Or the reasons why
they run with the bulls in Spain. Or
what people your age do in
Germany.

At Pitt Internationa-l Student
Organization (PISO), students are

‘encouraged to learn and share their

cultures and diversity. PISO is a
social club for international and
American students.

“It’s a very’ unique club.
[Through PISO] I was able to meet
a wide range and diversity of peo-
ple from everywhere,” said Cathy
Bazan, former PISO member from
Mexico and doctoral student.
“Some of the countries I didn’t
even know existed such as
Seychelles, off the coast of Africa.
And now I have friends from
there.”

During these meetings, inter-
national students are encouraged
to talk about their countries and
exchange cultural viewpoints with
other people from all over the
world.

“PISO is really there to pro-
mote the diversity of several cul-
tures and peoples that includes the
national diversity we have here in
the states,” Bazan said. “The club
has a diverse educational and
fundraising/service agenda, but it’s
primary function is social. It’s
fun.”

Like many student groups,
PISO has dances, seminars about
economic and political life in some
countries, and fundraising events
as well as other social activities.
The activities the club does
depends heavily on the members’
interests. ’

“The goal of the organization
was to have a more cultural, inter-
national exposure for students,”

- said Enrique Bazan, Cathy’s broth-
er and former PISO member. “We

did do social activities with other
groups. For instance,
together with the ski club to _go

, skiing.”

Cathy Bazan talked about some
of the fun PISO had: “trying to ski‘
 was interesting. Seeing some of

we got ‘

ski. There you have something to
look forward to.”

The club members enjoy inter-
acting with the many different peo-
ple through educational, service
and social activities. They enjoy
the company and the friendships
that they build through the club,
finding that it has given them a cir-
cle of friends all across the world.

“I think they’re all looking to
meet people,” said Joan Lucas,
PISO advisor. “For the internation-
al students, it helps them find
friends here in a new environment.
People who are in the states are
interested in the many internation-
al environments.” ,

Students with an interest in
meeting a diverse group of people
should feel free to attend a meet-
ing. PISO meets every Friday at
4:30 p.m., on the 7th floor of the
William Pitt Union in the lounge.

' AN INVITATION
A   To
THE CLASS or 2000
IN THE
COLLEGE or ARTS AND SCIENCES

The most prestigious academic honor for students in the liberal arts is to
be elected to Phi Beta Kappa. The qualifications for election are more
stringent than those for graduation from the College. Students who
aspire to this honor should plan their curricula during their early
undergraduate years so as to meet the requirements for membership.

For a‘ brochure containing information on these requirements
communicate with Edison Montgomery, the Secretary of the University
Chapter, on 624-7323 or by e-mail to Edison+@pitt.edu.

For discussion of the requirements, feel free to make an appointment to
visit with Professor Herbert Chesler, Chairman of the Elections
Committee. His telephone number is 648-1742; his e-mail address is
Chesler+@pitt.edu.

The Pitt Chapter of Phi Beta Kappa encourages undergraduates to grasp
this opportunity to achieve an honor that will be highly important to
them throughout their careers.

 

  

Child Support

House Democratic Party
Chairman Mike Veon, D—Beaver
Falls, has proposed a legislative
package to go after “deadbeat” par-
ents and make them pay the child
support they owe.

Nearly three—fourths of child
support cases in Pennsylvania do
not have full collection, according
to Veon. In 1995, Veon said, $217.4
million in child support was owed
to Pennsylvania children on the Aid
to Families with Dependant
Children program and in foster
care. $456 million was owed to

non—AFDC families.

Nationally, 43 percent of
women with children who are
unsuccessful in getting child sup-
port payments live below the_feder—
al poverty level. According to Veon,
their chances of remaining in
poverty are cut almost in half with
child support payments. _

“I believe an all—out, well—publi—
cized government effort to make
deadbeats pay up would help create
a climate in this state in which fail-
ure to support your children is
unacceptable,” Veon said when
making this proposal.

Veon said that in Pennsylvania,

 

MYTH #1: You have to be OUT.

The decision to come out is an individual one that cannot be
made by any group. You can be a member of BiGALA without
being out to anyone but the members.

MYTH #2: You have to be MILITANT.

Being out is often falsely equated with the idea of so—called
militancy. BiGALA is structured so that you determine your area
and level of involvement. We have separate social and
educational/political aspects to the group, and you can be
involved with one or both.

You have to be QUEER.

Supporting gay, lesbian, and bisexual rights does not mean you
have to be gay, lesbian, or bisexual.

Notes from

Harrisburg

$9.27 in child support is collected
for every $1 spent by the state.
Veon believes that this could save
the state money on AFDC and med-
ical assistance programs.

The Veon package is made up of
ten measures including allowing
courts to revoke a driver’s license
of an individual who willfully
chooses not to pay child support.
The license would be revoked until
that parent demonstrates to
PennDOT that he is complying with
the order. Deadbeats would also be
denied car registration.

Other measures include opening
up more information sources to

7 Youth Crime

State Rep. Don Walko, D-
Allegheny, held a meeting of com-

SEEKS NEW WAY TO MARKET

munity leaders, law enforcement
officials, and others concerned
about youth crime and violence last
week.

Walko urged state legislators to
protect communities and children in
Pennsylvania’s children by devel-
oping and studying effective pre-
vention programs that will help to
reduce youth crime.

“Without considering preven-
tion, we are leading our children
down a path that leads to 'more
crime,” Walko said.

Walko said that simply punish-
ing criminals in order to fight crime
is “costly and ineffective.”

DISGRUNHED VQUDOR

 

The public meeting is part of a
series of town meetings being held
across Pennsylvania by the
Democratic Policy Committee this
summer to address issues affecting
the quality of life of state residents.

Walko stressed the need to
review proposals and determine
their effectiveness, rather than “act—
ing in haste.” Walko said that, while
lawmakers are moving toward
imposing nightly curfews for juve-
niles, studies indicate that violent
crime peaks between 2 and 4 in the
afternoon.

One participant, Rick Solomon,
a doctor at Allegheny General

" FROM PAGE 12

of

Hospital’s Department
Pediatrics, said that family support
centers are vital links to curbing
crime.

“The cycle of poverty begins -

with families who are unable to
make it out of poverty,” Solomon
said. “Their children grow up
believing they cannot succeed.
They fail in school, end up on the
streets, turn to quick fixes for
poverty, and become the youth we
read about in the newspapers.

“We must support our families
through prevention, not wait until
they fail. And we can do this
through family support.”

then go to the department to have it signed and then to go
back to the registrar to file it. Now, the forms will be dis-

the ways in which arts and sciences hope to become more
efficient.

“The provost has also made a proposal that the name

“The College of Arts and Sciences will [however] contin-

Sentence

My parents, after raising two sons and
sending them off, have returned to the
role of caretakers,” Cecil said. “Who is
the real prisoner? Bruce Cabbagestalk
may not have killed me that night, but he
did take away my life.”

Carl Cecil, Kevin’s father, also spoke
at the sentencing, saying that Cecil was
shot in the back without warning and
never even saw his attacker.

“There is no justice in this case,” Carl
Cecil said. “As you can see, we still have

our son, but you can only imagine what-

he goes throug .”

Cabbagestalk now has 10 days to ﬁle
a motion through the public defenders’
office to postpone the sentence and 30
days to ﬁle an appeal. Outside the court-
room, his lawyer, Michael Nahas, said

FROM PAGE I 

that doing either of those things was high-
ly unlikely because “the judge is pretty
well set on thiscase.”

Nahas said that the sentence was
about what he had expected. “I agree with
Mr. Cecil’s father that there’s nothing to
do in the courtroom to right the action,”
Nahas said. “The best I can hope for is for
him to use the time wisely, come out, and

~ be a productive member of society.”

Carl Cecil said‘ that Kevin is physi-
cally healthy and is finishing an astrono-
my course through a Pitt extension pro-

gram, though he doesn’t know if Kevin-

will ever be able to return to campus.

“I have hope,” Carl Cecil said outside the
courtroom. “I’m not talking about mira-

Free education is better
when not behind bars!

According to Chancellor Mark Nordenberg,
“What we do find perhaps as the single most com-
mon reason that students drop out...is financial.
The sad truth is that there really is not a bargain
public education available to Pennsylvania stu-
dents.” Despite recognizing that this is a pressing
problem, recent events show that it won’t be
solved any time soon.

As those of you who have recently paid your
tuition bill have noticed, University of
Pittsburgh’s tuition was raised this year by 4.5
percent. This increase was attributed by Pitt’s
administration to the fact that the Pennsylvania

‘Legislature refused to increase Pitt’s budgetary
appropriation. Generally speaking, there is usual-
ly an increase in funding each year to allow for
inﬂation. The Ridge administration did not find
that necessary this year. It would seem that as the
rest of the world kept moving, education reached
a standstill.

The Ridge administration appears more con-
cerned with building new prisons than with build-
ing a future for the residents of this state. While
education funding for state—related schools stayed
level, money for the Department of Corrections

rose by $60 million. The Commonwealth of’

Pennsylvania is shortchanging itself and its peo-
ple. The way to better this state and prevent the
need for new prisons is through education.
Education and the doors it can open lead to crime
prevention. Isn’t solving the problem before it
happens better than waiting until after the fact?

Tuition should be governmentally funded and
free to all students. Open the venerated halls of
learning to all of the people not just a wealthy
few. Education should not be an elitist principle,
it should should be an earned reward to anyone
willing to put forth the effort to achieve it. The

"greatest crime in this state right now is that-it is
willing to put the needs of criminals before the
needs of its lawful citizens.

It is time that the government owned up to its
responsibility to its people. Education is a privi-
lege which is earned through hard work and the
desire to learn, not through how much of a wage
earner one or one’s parents are.

This country was based on the principle of

~ equal opportunity for all, yet it appears that we

still have a social caste system in which the rich
stay rich through perks and prejudices, while the
poor stay poor. Why can’t Pennsylvania keep up
with other states who have broken down the eco-
nomic barrier in educational opportunities?
The legislature does excuse of not having any
models to go by, as California and Florida have
I’ each found ways of making education available to
‘ everyone. There is no reason for us to continue
paying the price for this state ignoring the needs
of its citizens. It is time for the government to pay

Do we D.A.R.E. to end the war on drugs?

 

It was just last week that all
newspapers, to varying degrees and
within the conﬁnes of their respec-
tive styles, printed information about
increasing drug use among young
people in this country. Shock, Horror,
and Political Opportunity stand up
now, please. Tied to this news was
the predictable contention of the
Dole camp that this was all President
Clinton’s fault. YAY, another War on
Drugs, just what we need to divert
our attention from, say, the increase
in children committing murder or
some other such unimportant (mean-
ing, it’s-too-horrible-for—a—sexy—slo-
gan) issue.

I may be going out on a limb

' here, but frankly I’d prefer some nice

quiet heroin addicts nursing their
pain by themselves in their gloomy
little world to those who prefer to
wreak their pain in murderous vio-
lence upon me and my community.
Unforttmately, the sale of weapons,
violent death, and destruction are
some of America’s much boasted-of
“constitutional freedoms,” whereas
the sale of a nice bit of smack for per-
sonal use is not. I say, get these vio-
lence addicts off the streets and give
them some narcotic therapy — that
should calm their asses down a bit
Am I writing this to piss you oﬁ‘?
No, (well, maybe a bit) but I would
like to get your attention for some
information I uncovered in research-
ing this issue. Check this out: During
the last war on drugs, which cost
approximately $9 billion a year, the

.4),-

United States General Accounting
Oﬂice -— which, we might assume,
has no particular axe to grind - con-
cluded that “the attempts to restrict
the supply of drugs in America has
completely failed —— the effects of
even the most dramatic drug busts is
only very short term reduction in
supply, if that.”

In addition, another basic
dynamic of the previous tedious drug
war is noted by researcher J.

.Ostrowski. “Drug dealers are proﬁt-

motivated entrepreneurs uncon-
strained by the law. They have every
incentive to outwit new laws passed
in an effort to contain them. The
bureaucrats, who attempt to catch
them, however, are on straight salary
whether they catch anyone or not and
in addition risk retribution for any
arrests they make.”

In contrast, the pragmatic Dutch
spend their drug war dollars on edu-
cation, prevention and treatment.
Furthermore they distinguish (wow,
is there a difference?) between drugs
such as marijuana, cocaine, and hero-
in on the basis of inherent risk levels.
Apparently they hold to the radical
notion that properly informed indi-
viduals can handle drugs in a rela-
tively safe way. Naturally this
includes the decision to, ah, “just say
no.”

It seems that one of the major
problems in instituting a sensible
drug policy, like that of the
Netherlands (which holds that users
“should not be caused more harm by
criminal proceedings ﬂian by use of
the drug itself’) is that Americans,

.<DA:R~Ee Isay in am not intemsted

in real information. As noted by
Thomas Szasz, emeritus professor of
psychiatry at SUNY, “Americans
prefer mouthing catchy slogans to
thinking seriously about the meaning
of life.”

During the last war on drugs,
many people, including federal
judges, professors of law and even
some brave (but not too vocal) politi-
cians, denounced it as a waste of time
and money. But opinion polls consis-
tently show that Americans favor
tough—guy approaches to drug issues,
just like they do on other issues such

as capital punishment, abortion and '

gun control, in deﬁance of data
which repeatedly and consistently
shows that the tough stuﬂ DOES
NOT WORK! HELLO people, the
West is already won. Time to act like
the most powerful country in the
world and not the most macho. Yes,
there is a difference. Are Americans
stupid?

Professor John Burkhoff of our
Law School put it thus: “In a democ-
ratic society, you have the right to be
stupid. You have the right to have stu-
pid laws that don’t make sense, and

you have the right to work for-

change.” ,

A recent poll showed that 54
percent of Americans believe drugs
to be the greatest threat to the nation,
while only 4 percent named unem-
ployment. Fifty years later, Reefer
Madness is still alive and well in the
landofthefree.Whatarethese
freaks on? Alcohol and cigarettes?
'I'hat’s OK, I guess.

tant sports events that hap-
pened while you were

, away.

While you were away,
the AP Preseason Football
Poll came out. On that list
of the top 25 college teams
on the planet were all five
of Pitt’s road opponents
this season. This comes as
no surprise, since Notre
Dame, Syracuse, Ohio
State, Miami and Virginia
Tech have graced the AP
rankings forever.

Some might call this
gutsy scheduling. Some
might say that the only
way Pitt can reclaim a spot
among the nation’s
Division I elite is to play
any ranked team it can get
its mitts on.

Some people are
morons. Throwing a recov-
ering program at the feet of
the Fighting Irish and oth-
ers is like throwing a gold-
en gloves middleweight,
sans athletic supporter,
into the ring with Andrew
Golota so he can get some

good competition. An
upset might win the
Panthers 15 minutes of

football fame, but more
than likely, this squad will
be used for target practice
and end up with a sub-.500
record.

While you were away,
the United States wiped the

crete with the rest of the

Juco transfer
Dwayne
Schulters (#24)
hopes to bolster
a solid Pitt
Panther running
core. See how
the rest of the
Pitt team stacks
up against the
competition
below.

The best of times, the worst of times

Mike Kok

It’s difficult to determine
exactly how this season will go

for the Pitt Panthers. The home ‘

schedule, which includes Temple,
Rutgers, Kent and Houston, looks
ﬁiendlier than previous seasons.

A solid recruiting class
(ranked ﬁrst in the Big East)
should also help Pitt, who lost 24
lettermen and 11 starters from last
year’s 2-9 squad. A few freshmen
to look for this season are defen-
sive back/kick returner Seth
Homack, defensive lineman
Demond Gibson and running
back LaFann Williams.

The performance of the
defensive unit should determine
how far the Panthers will travel
this season. However, Denorse
Mosley, arguably Pitt’s best
defensive player, has been sus-
pended for the entire season and
his football future here is in jeop-

 

ardy. The pressure will be on
Rashaad Whitmill (2 lNTs) and
last year’s leading rusher
Demetrius Harris (610 yds, 5
TDs) to ﬁll his shoes. Harris, who
has practiced with the defense
during fall camp, has been ham-
pered by a shoulder injury.

“It’s quite obvious we have
to rebuild the defense pretty
much,” Head Coach Johrmy
Majors said. “It is going to be no
small feat.”

The good news on the
Panther defense is the return of
linebacker Jason Chavis, the
team’s leading tackler in 1994.
Chavis did not play last season
but provides defensive coordina-
tor Chuck Driesbach with a

proven productive performer,

although he’ll be playing a new
position — right defensive end.
Chavis and safety John Jenkins
provide the only real gametime
experience on a thin Pitt defense.

“It doesn’t matter if a defense

is inexperienced or not,” Chavis
said. “What matters is if the
defense is going to gel and I think
this one is.”

The play of Hudson Valley
Community College transfer
Ernest Coakley impressed the
coaching staff enough that
Majors named him starting out-
side linebacker for the opener
against West Virginia.

Offensively, all the talk cen-
ters around the return of Billy
West and the quarterback situa-
tion. West, the 1994 Big East
Offensive Player of the Year, was
redshirted last season after break-
ing his leg against Virginia Tech.
If West returns to form and back-
ups Dwayne Schulters, Myke
Duck, and Wﬂharns can comple-
ment him, Pitt’s backﬁeld, which
also includes Chris Schneider,
could be one of the Big East’s
best.

The Pitt News has a feeling — Pittsburgh's goin’ to the Super Bowl

(Editors Note: The following is how we see
the 1996 NFL season. )

We in The Pitt News sports department
are wasting no time in soliciting letters from
readers telling us how dumb we are. So here
are our expert predictions for the 1996 NFL
season.

In the AFC, the Bulfalo Bills are still
not dead. Quarterback Jim Kelly, running

' back Thurman Thomas, and receiver Andre

Reed have been playing since the Mesozoic
Era and aren’t likely to ﬁnish the season

’injury—free, but that doesn’t matter. Darrick

Holmes, who has ﬁlled in for Thomas very
nicely in the past, is ready to share the load
at running back. Buffalo was prepared to

lose Reed this summer, so they set out to »

assemble the deepest group of receivers

‘anywhere.

Quarterback controversy aside, the
Pittsburgh Steelers are the unanimous
choice to win the AFC Central Division.
Whether it’s Jim Miller, Mike Tomczak, or

Bubby Blister at the helm, the Steelers —
namely nmning backs Jerome Bettis and
Eric Pegram — should run all over this
division. On defense, the return of the
Steelers’ best player, Rod Woodson, from
last season’s injury, can only improve the
NFL’s best defensive unit.

Look for the Kansas City Chiefs to
come out on top in the wild, wild west divi-
sion. Teams will be ﬁghting for playotf
spots and even ﬂie division championship
until the last game of the season. The battle-
hardened Chiefs do that every year, and that

should be the difference. s

As a lovely consolation prize, the
Denver Broncos and Oakland Raiders
will receive wild-card berths in the playolfs.
It may seem insigniﬁcant, but Denver has
the best kicker in the NFL.

Even without Rocket Ismail, they still
have the kind of explosive offense that can
be hard to handle. The biggest threat to the
Raiders may come from owner Al Davis,
who continues to make players want to
leave Oakland.

Oh, and Carl, next time you
want to join a relay team, here’s one

The league did play its first reg-

the Padres and Dodgers squared off
in a three—game set below the Rio

available from vendors and
Fernando Valenzuela pitched mar-

had a good time.

While you were away, Golota

Madison Square Garden into a

Golota lost the fight on disqualifi-

Yes, Virginia, there really is a field hockey team

 

Eight years ago, the University
of Pittsburgh Athletic Department
ended an era of women’s field hock-
ey. At the time, the school said inter-
est was declining to the point where
keeping the program was a financial
liability.

Now, thanks mostly to the efforts
of Susie Stonehouse and Erin
Listvok, women’s field hockey
returned to Pitt two years ago as a
club team.

“We started from
Stonehouse, the field hockey club
‘president, said. “We really had no
clue what to do.”

Eventually, things began to
snowball for the two students, who
are both entering their fourth year at
Pitt. The most difficult things were
dealingwith Pitt and the administra-
tion within.

For any club to get started at
Pitt, the first step is to get certifica-
tion. Once certified, it becomes eas-
ier for-clubs to get privileges such as
money, equipment and vehicles.
However, obtaining these things has
not been easy for the field hockey
club, even though they are certified
and boast the largest group (around

scratch,” -

45 people) of any sport club at Pitt.
Last year, the club had to drive

_ their own vehicles to a game against

Slippery Rock University, fight for
practice time at the Cost Center and
supply all their own equipment.

Supplying the equipment is not
the problem since most of the
women (and one man) had already
owned things from playing in high
school or youth leagues.

“The problem is they [the Cost
Center] would only give us practice
times at like 8:00 p.m. on Saturday
night, and we can’t schedule games
there,” Listvok, the vice-president of
the field hockey club, said. “It’s hard
to stay dedicated to something when
you get times like that.”

For those who do not know much
about field hockey, now’s the time to
go to school. No more than 11 peo-
ple from one team can be on the field
at the same time. In terms of posi-
tions, field hockey resembles soccer.

According to Stonehouse, nor-
mally a team will have four for-
wards, two on the wing and two in
the middle. The forwards are relied
upon to do the bulk of the scoring.
There are two midfielders, some-
times there may be three, depending
on the amount of forwards in the
lineup. The front line of defense

consists of three players and there is
a sweeper to make sure the goalie
sees as little action as possible.

The action is back—and-forth and
usually results in a low-scoring
game.

_ “Most of the time,” Stonehouse
said, “the score is like 2-1 or some-
thing like that.”

Don’t let the low scores mislead
you, because field hockey contains
constant running, passing, dribbling
and teamwork. It’s not as physical as
ice hockey, checking isn’t nearly as
violent or aggressive, but it is still a
physically demanding sport that
requires good hand—eye coordina-
tion. Plus, it can be tough on your
back, bending over all the time car-
rying a field hockey stick.

“Your back does get sore at
first,” Stonehouse said. “That’s
because people are supposed to
squat with their sticks instead of
bending over to carry them.”

Pitt’s field hockey club has two
tentative games set with Slippery
Rock and Indiana University of
Pennsylvania this fall. Last year, Pitt
played SRU and lost 3-0, but played
well.

As the club tries to become a
full-ﬂedged member of the Pitt var-
sity sports community, they are try-

ing to schedule more games with
mostly smaller schools or lower-
division schools. It’s not to avoid
tough competition, it’s because the
team is only considered a club sport,
and games against schools where
field hockey is sanctioned by the
respective universities are difficult
to obtain. '

The Pitt Athletic Department
refuses to fund the program, so they
turned to the Student Government
Board (SGB) for help.-

“The SGB said they’ll provide
our equipment if we can find the
storage space,” Stonehouse said.

The problems field hockey has
faced because of the athletic depart-
ment are rather ironic.

“We’ve tried to become a real
team, but people have been reluc-
tant,” Listvok said. “Carol Sprague
[senior associate athletic director]
was the head coach of the team when
they were dropped eight years ago
and she told us we should stick to
intramurals.”

For those students interested in
helping make field hockey a team
sport, you can contact the Office of
Student Affairs to obtain the neces-
sary phone numbers for a simple
local telephone call, or look for them
practicing on the Cathedral Lawn.

The remaining AFC wild card spot will be occupied by the
Miami Dolphins. Trading running back Teny Kirby could have
been a wise move, but doing so under a new coach who likes to
run the ball is certainly not. That kind of mismanagement will keep
the Dolphins where they have been for years — staring right at the
backs of the Buffalo Bills in the AFC East.

_ Speaking of the Bills, America will groan as they get per-
ilously close to their ﬁfth Super Bowl appearance in seven seasons.
hi the end, youth will prevail as Jim Miller and Kordell Stewart
lead the Steelers over Buﬂ'alo in the AFC Championship game.

The NFC East is too weak for the Dallas Cowboys to lose, no
matter how hard they try. They could lose the whole defense to free
agency and all of their receivers to drug busts. They still have too

much ﬁrepower to be beaten by any of the other four teams in the
division.

The rising stars of the NFC, the Green Bay Packers, should
handily win the Central Division. The weaﬂier in Green Bay in
December is a built-in advantage for the home team, but the
Packers also have in Brett Favre a star quarterback who plays even
better in the cold.

The San Francisco 49ers look as good as ever. Steve Young
and J en'y Rice show no signs of age, the defense is still quietly one
of the best in the league, and new acquisition Teny Kirby makes
this team even better. This season will prove once and for all that
San Francisco is the class of the NFC.

There are some things you can count on every fall. The leaves
will change colors; the air will get cooler; Coach Wayne Fontes
will nearly be ﬁred in rnid—season, then lead his Detroit Lions to
the playoffs, where they will be beaten by about 50 points. This
year will be no different. Barry Sanders can still only take this team
so far.

The Philadelphia Eagles are in a similar predicament.
They’re slightly better than most of the mediocre NFC teams; cer-
tainly good enough to beat them out in the playoﬁ chase. They
might even win a playoff game, but when they have to take the
ﬁeld against the Big Three teams, they will look like a Pop Warner
team. -
The Aﬂanta Falcons are a mediocre team. The oﬂ’ense will
score a lot of points— enough to get them in the playoffs— but if
defense wins championships (and it does), the Falcons are in trou-
ble come championship time.

Only one thing will change in the NFC this year. Green Bay
will replace Dallas in the championship game. Cowboy fans
need not be disappointed though, because whichever team faces
San Francisco is in for a trouncing. Neither team has the defense to
contain the 49ers.

The Steelers don’t either, but they will make it a closer game.
In a low scoring game, the 49ers will beat the Steelers in Super
Bowl XXXI.

“The tailback position improved in the
spring with Schulters coming in,” Majors
said. “I’m encouraged by his possibilities.
We have much better depth at tailback.”

Matt Lytle (299 yds, 1 TD) will be the
Panthers’ nurnber-one signal caller after
beating out Pete Gonzalez and Darnell
Dinkins in camp. Lytle possesses a strong
arm and is mobile in the pocket.

What the coaches are concerned with
is who Lytle will throw the ball to. Curtis
Anderson (25 catches, 264 yards) is Pitt’s
leading returning receiver. During camp,
transfer Jake Hoffart, freshman Andy
Molinaro, and former quarterback Leon
Murray performed well and hope to make
contributions this season.

“I think Leon Murray is a good ath-
lete,” Majors said. “I think he has good
quarterback possibilities, but he’s had a
good attitude about trying receiver this
summer. [Murray] said he’d like to do it as
a volunteer.” »

The tight end situation looks better
than it has in years with John Jones as the
starter and juco transfer Juan Williams as
the backup. Jones, who is physically
imposing, speedy and has recorded a verti-
cal jurnp of 38.5 inches, has all the neces-
sary tools to be an outstanding contributor
to a Panther offense that is surrounded with
optimism entering the year.

If this season is going to end with a
bowl game, the key for Pitt will be to go
undefeated at home and hopefully upset
one of ﬁve top-25 road opponents.
