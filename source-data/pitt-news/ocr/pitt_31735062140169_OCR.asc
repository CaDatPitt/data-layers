EXAM. TIME

Next week the favorites start the

term examina-.tions, which are adored

by all thestudents in the institution.
The/ tests are billed to take place,
and nothing we can do will be able
to avert the coming disaster of the
ill favored few. ~‘We cannot ‘even
encourage the fearing ones, for we too
are but mere students, subject to the

will of thegyellow sheet of the in-
quisitive professor. We do not, there-

i. fore, purport to write a lengthy treat-

Vise on the virtue of the examination,
but it«is our intention to observe
rather minutelythe aspect of the ex-
amination scehule. From a few more

For less authentic sources it is learned

that many students will be forced ,to
have as. many as ﬁve ‘tests
in one day, which is by no means a
very pleasant prospect for any one,
be he student or ordinary mortal. The

‘ plan by which the examinations are

to bearranged is based on the as-

sumption thatthe last two hours of.
recitation will be devoted to quiz.-

Granting that many of the students
have a schedule containing at least
three consecutive hours in a day, it

is easily seen the amount of labor

which will be involved in the prepara-
tion for one day's work will be.con-
siderable. Formerly the examination
schedule was such that the student
was at least entitledpto some oppor-
tunity for study, but now, the plan
of the faculty seems to be, that a man
is only accountable for the time he
spends in sleep. To be sure, that is
somewhat exaggerated, but the fact
remains that we are given extremely
little time -for preparation by the new
method, which is to have its ﬁrst ‘trial
next week. It should be. borne in
mind that students are merely human,
and subject‘ to the .events of life just
the same as anyone else, willing, most
assuredly, to ltake all examinations
with a smile of resignation and meek-

iness that is scarcely imaginable in
’mortal bodies.

‘THE ‘SCHOOL CONFERENCE.

The first annual conference of
schools and colleges given last .week
by the University in Memorial Hall
is the most effective attempt on the
part of the University of Pittsburgh to
reach into the affairs of this com-'
munity and assert itself, that has oc-
curred in the last twenty-ﬁve years.
All the secondary colleges of the im-
mediate territory were represented, as
Well as seventy-ﬁve high schools
from all parts of Western Pennsyl-
vania. The great impetus given to
the work of educationlcan scarcely be
recognized at the first glimpse given
to the effects of the late conference;
when it is taken into /consideration
that the University of Pittsburgh -oc-
cupies a position of commanding at-
titude by reason of its location and
facilities, it can be easily understood
why the opening up of this most pro-
liﬁc ﬁeld at the initiative of -the Uni:
versity means much to the institution.
The day is not far distant when the
schools and secondary colleges of this
end of the State will cluster about
the University for support and main-
tenance in a way» that is not depend-
ent, but for the beneﬁtiof both. Our
recently formed school of education
is the nucleus about which is being
erected the foundation of co-opera-
tion on the part of the schools of
Western Pennsylvania. The session
last week was a beneﬁt to all those in
attendance,‘ for it sent man and
woman back to their respective duties
better prepared for their work. The
conference is to be hereafter a yearly
affair, and it is hoped its prestige may
grow with each year of its existence.

Most all the students are badly cut,
as a resul-t of the new scheme of cut
allowances.

Even the poor water pipe bursted
right out laughing at the new cut
system.

The bulletin boards were profuse
with apologies during last week
Next week they will be all on paper.

date the large crowd attending the

The 1912 Owl
Just now the air is full of the
plans of our annual contemporary,

.“The Owl,” and while the thought is
uppermost in our minds, it might not
be amiss to indulge in a little com-

portunity to say many things about
the University and its affairs before

hazard a few remarks «concerning the
The Weekly has

no connection with the editors of the
year book and, therefore, no hint‘ of
their ideas for the melange of pict-
ures,, witticisms, near humor and the
like, which is perpetrated ‘ upon us
yearly, can be divined. Sufﬁce it to
say, the men from all departments
are hard at work, and it‘appears as if
the 1912 “Owl” is going to be all that
is hoped for. The board, though,
should bear in mind the book which
was published atia date considerably
later than the Elizabethan_ age, and
the lesson it taught to all Owls of
-the future. The truth revealed is just

coming publication.

. this, the annual year book belongs to

the University of Pittsburgh, and not
to any individual or Bunco Clubs (we
forget, was that the name ?_) Anyway,
the gentlemen who so forgot their
University loyalty to relegate the
athletic records of their Alma Mater
to make way for a personal organiza-
tion, are not the ones to edit any
publication which must go out to the
people as the product\of the" Uni-
versity of Piettsbui-gh—not alone those
men of a year, or ten years ago,
whatever it may be, but at any time
in the career of this institution.
What we need most is broad-minded-
ness in the conduct of the student
activities. We know absolutely noth-
ing concerning the next “Owl,” as
was said at the beginning, but we do
call to the attention of those at its

lief that the 1912 Board is composed

very fact that they areiendeavoring

that is. after all, the greatest incentive
the men of the Board can receive, the
knowledge that the students are sub-
scribing to their enterprise with a
will and a determination to support
the editors. It is easy .to produce a
book worthy of University calibre, if
the University stands back of the
proposition. ~

DR. DYESS LECTURES.

The‘ Historical Society of Western
Pennsylvavnia began a series of lect-
ures Friday afternoon for the beneﬁt

The Senate

The Weekly had occasion to men-
tion the inactivity of the ‘Senate a
few weeks ago, and it is pleasing to
note the renewed activity that body
has taken on. "The student senate
has a great power for good in a Col-

lege or University, and it is -always

good to see the most made of the op-
portunity_ to get work out of the men
elected to the office. In spite of the
kind hopes entertained for our sen-
ators in the opening sentence, we are
still ﬁrm in the belief that they are
not fully organized yet. There seems
to be a lack of the superlative quality

known as initiative among the men of ‘

the student representative body. A

small matter was discussed in chapel

one morning last week, which was
primarily a senate matter, and had
the body been organized to its fullest
efﬁciency, the embarassment of the
moment would have been immensely
relieved by reference of the difﬁculty
to the senate. The thing to do now

is to get organized fully for the work, ,

and then go after it.

AN EXPLANATION.

The following letter is reprinted
from the bulletin boards about the
University: . '

At a_ meeting in chapel last Monday
I called the attention of the students
to the fact that an alumnus (Mr.
Zeig) had apparently been boosting

the Nixon theater under the guise of.

In justice to Mr.
Zeig I desire to give equal prom-
inence to Mr. Zeig’s explanation
to me, that the fact that both of the
theater parties, which he boosted,
were at the Nixon, was only a coin-
cidence, and his emphatic denial that
he was inﬂuenced by any considera-
tion, except a desire to insure a good
showing for Pitt at the theater.

N. L. Estabrook,

school loyalty.

Many students were interested in _

the several notices posted about the
University, and for their information
the Weekly is authorized to say, the
controversy between therabove men-
tioned gentlemen was caused by_ 3.
misconception of each -other’s purpose.

MASONIQ CLUB IS FORMED.

Steps have been taken to form a
Masonic Club in the University. It has
been planned to pattern it after the
clubs existing at Yale, Harvard, Penn-
sylvania and at several other large uni-
1t 13

departments of the University immedi-
ately hand in or address his name and.

  PITT WINS THE CUP

Tech is Outrooted at the Nixon in Competition

I

so for Elsie Janis Cup

In the’ midst of wild enthusiasm

and unre'strained school spirit, George‘

Kirk, the able cheerleader of the
Gold and Blue, led_the Pitt students
to a rooting victory over the Techites

_ at the Nixon Theater on Monday

night, November 28._ The theater
management invited the football
teams of the various schools of the

-city to be their guests on Monday

night and Miss Elsie Janis, the star
in the musical comedy “The Slim
Princess,” very generously offered a
beautiful loving cup to the school
showing the best spirit. In order to
get permanent possession of this cup
a school must win it three years in
succession.

The Pitt team occupied the box on

.the right of the stage with the Tech

team in the box opposite. Shadyside
Academy’s football men were in the
second box on the right, bu-t none of
the. Pittsburgh High School fellows
were present on account of the death
of their principal, Prof. Schuyler.

_‘The different boxes were gayly deco-

rated with the respective school

colors, with beautiful effect.

"In the ﬁrst and second galleries
were located the rooters for the vari-
ous schools, and before the play be~
gan and between the acts, all sorts of
rousing cheers reverberated through
the large amphitheater. The Tech
contingent were the most numerous,
but their yells were scattered for the
most'part, in spite of the Creatore
like motions of their cheerleader. On
the other hand Pitt’s cheering was in

perfect unison and the famous “Alli-
gee-nee” resounded with clear cut pre— ,

eision.

Miss Janis was a great favorite
from the start and was the inspira-
tion for many’ a hearty cheer. In the

last act she came out from her part

of “The Slim Princess” long enough
to sing a couple of songs to the foot-
ball players, which she had written
herself. And at the end she pre-
sented the loving cup in her at-
tractive way to George Kirk as Pitt’s
representative. Kirk spoke a few
words of acceptance, and then called
for three. cheers for Miss Janis, which
were given with enthusiastic hearti-
ness.

Fire. which for a time caused great
excitement, broke out in the school-of

Hall, where a quantity of c_ombu'stibl«e
material is stored. The hall of the
building was ﬁlled by smoke, but prompt
work on the part of those nearby soon
extinguished the ﬂames. The classes in

panic.

Pipe In Thaw Hall Bursts, Sending
Water Through Corridors At
a Lively Rate.

The engineering students arrived
at Thaw Hall on Friday morning to
ﬁnd the building in a rather moist
state. The whole shop ﬂoor was
running with water and the book
store looked asif a ﬁre sale would
soon be in order. A ﬁre supply pipe

had broken off in the elevator shaft
on the third ﬂoor some time during

the night and the stream of water
had saturatedthe walls around the
elevator shaft and run all down
through the building. It had evi-
dently been running a long while be-
fore they were able to shut it off ’and
considerable damage resulted.

THE ‘PITT WEEKLY

A Bonfire and Pretzels lwliat Others Are Doing

State Game Is Celebrated Lastl .

A new mineral called “groutite”

Wednesday Night By H389: has been discovered by a member of

Bonfire — Pretzels are
Attraction.

To celebrate ._tl’lC wonderfully suc-
cessful football season, just ﬁnished,
a large crowd of students of the Uni-
versity gathered around an immense‘
blazing bonﬁre on the campuson

We(lnesday night and had a good old-
fashioned jolliﬁcation. Snow was fal-5

ling heavily, and the bleak wind
swept ﬁercely down over the bare hill.-.

.But that only added enthusiasm to

the occasion, lending an air of weird-
ness and making the warmth of the
ﬁre most agreeable. Refreshments
were donated very liberally by the Deans

of the different departments and the

‘way they disappeared proved that

"very instructive and

they were well appreciated. Profes-

-sor Fetterman furnished a barrel of

apples, Dr. Bishop _a barrel of cider,
and Dr. Holdsworth added a goodly
supply of pretzels. Much enthusiasm
was "shown on all sides and everyone
voted this second annual celebration
at most successful occasion.

Thaw Hall, an anatomyy in general and
joints in particular. Mr. Hilliard is
a freak of most striking rarity, whose

'ability to dislocate any joint in ‘his

body is the constant wonder o-f the

entire medical profession. Dr. Wal-
gren, of the medical department, in-

' troduced the man and said that he
A was giving lectures and demonstra-

tions in all the large schools of the
country.

Mr. Hilliard’s demonstration was
educational to‘

‘that are otherwise hard to under-

stand.
