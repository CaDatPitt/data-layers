The _Pitt News

The University Times in a recent
story distorted the purpose of the
administration’s new proposal to
eliminate credit/ no entry grading,
according to Dr. Neil Timm, direc-
tor of management information and
policy analysis for the university.

The story, which ran in the May 2
issue of the Times, stated that the
elimination of the credit/ no entry"
option was being considered
because of cost. According to the
story, the registrar's ofﬁce keeps two
transcripts for students who elect to
take a class on a credit/ no entry
basis. The first transcript has no
record of the course if the student
receives no entry for it. The second
has the course printed out on it and
proves that the student actually took
the course if he or she needs proof of
full-time status toreceive financial
aid, the story continued. The elimi-

Loca Job

By Joelle Latine
The Pitt News

The Pittsburgh Job Corps has
recently been rated no. I by a
government study. However, the
question still remains as to how long
the Job Corps will stay in operation.

Since the Job Corps is operated
indirectly under a competitive con-
tract with the U.S. Department of
Labor, it is subject to the question of
whether the center is worth keeping
open.

A percentage of the tax dollars
going to the government are given to
the 105 Job Corps centers through-
out the U.S. for operation. Accord-
ing to an independent study, the
estimated savings for the public are
$34 million. Forty percent of the
corps members were on welfare
prior to entering the program. After
going through an average of 8.2
months of the program, 60.6 percent
found employment or entered the
military, 15.1 percent entered a form
of higher education, and ﬁve percent
returned to prison. For every dollar
invested in the Job Corps through

. taxes and various other reductions,

the individual American will receive
an estimated $1.16 to $2 back within
three years.

Timm explained that when a stu-

the credit/no entry class) does not
appear on his academic transcript.
If a student taking the credit/no

entry option is audited by a financial ‘

aid organization, Timm said, the
university is under the burden to
prove that the student was actually
enrolled for 12 credits and eligible
for financial aid for those 12 credits.
“We have to physically go back into
the registration cycle and pull out
the bill and write a letter explaining
that the student was full-time,"
Timm said.

The university-wide committee of
which Timm was a part proposed
that the no entry system be replaced _
with a system that would place an X
on the transcripts of the students
who took the course credit / no entry.

gives the students who pass the
course with an A, B or C an S on
their transcripts. If the student fails
to pass the course, nothing appears
on the transcript. The proposed
grading system calls for an X to be
placed on the student’s transcript if
he does not pass the course.

Some faculty members are
opposed to this new plan.

CAS Dean Irwin Schulman said: -
“The credit/ no entry grade option ‘

reduces benefits and reduces risks. It
encourages students to take courses
outside their field.”

Schulman said he feels that fewer
students will take courses on an
experimental basis if they would
receive an X on their transcripts.

“X's look funny on a transcript,” -

Schulman said.

Timm disagrees with this view.
“The X simply means ‘not graded.’
The student is enrolled in the course
for experimental purposes. It is not
to be used for good or bad.”

for underprivileged youth, has been
in operation since 1971. The center
has over 24 academic and vocational
professionals who teach the 340
corps members. The center is struc-
tured for yong adults from the ages
of 16 to 22 who are out of school, out
of work and meet the requirements.
High school drop-outs can earn a
Equivalency Diploma.
Along with academic skills, these
youth learn vocational skills that_
will prepare them for the job market.

Some of the various trades offered
include auto mechanics, telecom-
munications, building maintenance,
culinary arts, business/clerical
skills, metal working and health
occupations.

According to Ray Crew, a
member who is involved in the culi-
nary arts program, “My future has
benefited because of the Job Corps.”
For Pete Walker, who is studying

Heart patient

(UPI) — The world's longest-
living mechanical heart patient
has suffered a brain hemorrhage.

A spokesman for Humana
Hospital Audubon said that CT-
scans performed Monday on Bill
Schroeder show he suffered a
brain hemorrhage. A CT, or
CAT-scan, is an advanced X-ray
technique that records images of
thin cross sections of tissue and
bone.

The spokesman indicated that
heart surgeon Dr. William Dev-
ries believes the bleeding in the
brain has stopped.

Schroeder was re-admitted to
the hospital Monday, exactly
one month after he became the
ﬁrst artiﬁcial heart patient to live
in a specially converted apart-
ment outside a hospital.

hospitalized

He is listed in critical but sta-
ble condition in the hospital’s
coronary care‘ unit. Hospital
spokeswoman Donna Hazle said
the CAT-scans showed the hem-
orrhage but did not reveal its
origin. She said the doctors have
ordered another scan to be per-
formed later to compare the pic-

tures.

She said she does not know if
Schroeder has suffered any brain
damage or whether he can
respond to questions. Schroeder
suffered a stroke last December
and has had difficulty speaking
and moving as a result.

Ofﬁcials said Schroeder was
brought into the hospital Mon-
day because he had “some pro-
gressive weakness during the
weekend.”

in a volunteer program. They volun-
teer at hospitals, homes for the
elderly and handicapped, the Spe-
cial Olympics and, recently, the
Pittsburgh Marathon. Their volun-
teer work is assigned to them by
public relations officer Joan Pincus.

Corps members receive pay twice

monthly from the government, a
yearly clothing allowance, dental
and medical care, home and recrea-
tion. Following their training’ at Job
Corps, most students need money to
begin their new career. Youths
attending the Job Corps’ program‘
for six months will receive $450 after
termination, and the amount
increases the longer they stay.

Enrollees begin at Job Corps in
phase one and progress through four
phases depending on where they
stand along what administrators call
“a merit point system." According to
center director Vincent Doram,
“You have to be able to get along
with people if you're going to make
it in the world.” Under this four-
phase system, Doram added, “If a
corps member fails, we terminate
him.”

Besides giving members a better
understandings of what is demanded
of them in the job market, Job Corps
helps them mature. According to
Steve Robbins, who attends Com-
munity College of Allegheny
County under Job Corps, “It has
made me more independent, and
they helped me come out’ of my
shell." Diana Buyna said she feels
that by learning clerical skills, “Job
Corps has given me a better self-
image."

The program benefits not only the
students but instructors as well.
Clerical instructor Sylvia Viviano
said: “There is a satisfaction to see
these people make a turn around
and go on to jobs. They come in as

. street kids and you watch them

grow. This program gives them a
chance." ..
In essence, according to Bernice
Cummings, associate program
director, “Job Corps is the last step

, until prison or the streets.”

 WP|C uses fomil   support group
.’ro oid in the bott erof depression

By Nadia Moritz
The Pitt News

Susan is depressed. She can’t sleep
or eat. Finals are coming up, and she
hasn’t been able to concentrate in
weeks. Her friends keep telling her
to snap out of it, but she can’t.

‘at Ann has a history of depression in

her family. She hasn't experienced
the illness in years, but her son is
having problems in school, and she
thinks he may be an alcoholic.

Erik’s wife is going through
another bout of depression. She is
being treated, but he wants to help
and doesn’t know how.

Susan, Ann and Erik are not real
people, but there are thousands like
them in Allegheny County victims
of depression. The Depressive
Illness Support Group of Western

.g Psychiatric lnstitute and Clinic is

working to help these victims.

The support group, consisting of
former or current depression
patients as well as their families and
friends was initiated last April as an
auxilliary program to WPlC’s
depression prevention program's
Family Workshop.

“Many patients and friends, after
the workshop, decided that it was

organize and share experiences,”
said Miriam Jacob, coordinator of
WPlC’s depression prevention
clinic. “As they became more
informed, they also became more
interested in sharing their experien-
ces, especially to the public at large.”

Along with a May lecture series
on depression, the support group is
part of WPlC’s spring venture to
combat depression. Spring is the
time of year, according to Jacob,
when depression victims “feel more
at odds with the rest of the world.”

“Depressed people blend in in the
winter, but in the spring when eve-
ryone is getting out, the depressed
people are not and they realize their

problem,” said Jacob. “We are try-

ing to capitalize on this natural
phenomenon.”

However, the withdrawn nature
of the people affected by depression
and the misunderstandings of the
public about the illness make the
communication difficult.

“There are a lot of myths about
depression,” said Jacob. “It’s a com-
mon mood. Everybody has it, and
everyone thinks it is just the blues 
just a bad day.”

The clinical case of depression
develops as the bad days turn into
bad ‘weeks and bad months. Other
symptoms of depression include
unrealistic guilty feelings, tiredness,
difficulty in concentrating and sleep-
ing disorders. ln many cases, the
familiar nature of the symptoms of
depression allows the illness to con-
tinue to be overlooked by the
patients and their peers.

“Instead of considering depres-
sion treatment, a concerned friend
will say something like ‘Snap out of
it. get yourself together,’ ‘Take a
vacation’ or ‘Buy a dress,’ " said Ja-
cobs. “But it’s a mistake to believe
that people have this control.”

WPIC is working to correct this
mistake through the support group
discussions as well as expanding

their discussions to public meetings‘

and lectures where the patients join

the staff members on the podium.

Mary Louise Gill, a 34-year-old professor at Pitt, reported that her
purse was stolen on May 5 at Fifth and Craft avenues. Gill stated that
two black youths came up from behind and knocked her down causing
her glasses to fall off.

The loss was valued at S l 60, and contents of the black leather purse
included a check, credit cards, personal papers, keys and make-up.
The victim was not injured. She described the youths as being between
l2 and 15 and one was wearing a blue jacket.

A Pitt student who lives on Forbes Avenue reported that his apart-
ment was burglarized May 2. The loss was valued at $500 and included
a tape deck and television set. The living room window was broken.

iii
On May 5, a Pitt student’s Dawson Street apartment was burglar-
ized. One hundred ﬁfteen dollars in cash was stolen, and pry marks on
the front door are suspected by police to be signs of forced entry.

John Bray, 34, was arrested on charges of disorderly conduct on
May 4. Police observed Bray standing outside of Capri Pizza, kicking
and punching the glass door and swearing at customers.

Police reported that Bray screamed to one customer, ‘‘I’m gonna
come in there and kill you.” A large crowd gathered on the sidewalk
and police arrested Bray before taking him away in a wagon. A store
employee later stated that Bray was harassing customers earlier in the
evening allegedly causing many to leave.

Orvaschel’s discussion utilized
national studies as well as her own
ongoing research on the relation-

genetic and environmental effects of
depression, the feelings of guilt and
inadequacy experienced by
depressed parents and possible
treatments for parents and children.

Orvaschel, and the experience is the
same as the depression experienced
by adults.

In a group discussion after the lec-
ture, the participants echoed the
concerns that Jacob expressed: the
need to educate the public about
depressive illness and the availabil-
ity of treatment.

“We still don't realize depression
is a mental illness, and we must,”
said one member of the group. “I’m
for anything that will get this mon-
key off all our backs.”

“There needs to be a message
communicated that there is treat-

‘Mother of the Yeor' recipients give
thoughts about coreers ond motherhood

(UPI) — Motherhood is the
oldest institution in the world.
We all have a mother, so we all
know something about mother-
hood even if we are not parents
ourselves.

Every year, many organiza-
tions, such as the Mothers Day
Committee, ‘choose outstanding
women as their “Mother of the
Year.” Some of the outstanding
mothers on the committee
selected this year offer us a few
observations on the nature of
motherhood.

Astronaut Anna Fisher, for
example, is the mother of a two-
year-old and also holds the dis-
t_i_nction of being Wthe first

American woman to walk in
space.

“A lot of things in life, when
you look forward to them, aren’t
as great as expected when they
happen,” she said. But for her,
motherhood and traveling in
outer space turned out better
than anticipated.

Based on her own experience,
Fisher said she thinks a woman’s
relationship with her mother is
enhanced when she becomes a
mother herself.

Another outstanding mom is
opera singer Frederica von
Stade. Von Stade said her moth-
er’s greatest gift was to teach her

the importance of children. She
says children give adults “the
kind of belief that everything's
worth it.”

Not all mothers enjoy national
fame. but actress Susan Lucci,
who portrays Erica Kane on the
long-running TV soap opera “All
My Children,” is one of those
who do. But fame and profes-
sional achievement aren’t every-
thing to her. Lucci said the award
recognizing her strength as a
mother means more to her than
an Emmy. A

To some people, a mother is in
essence a person who has unfail-
ing confidence in you. That char-

acterization is embodied in the
philosophy of the woman called
“Mother” Hale, who has
mothered hundreds of babies
born suffering from drug with-
drawal in New York’s Harlem.

She's known forgsaying, “You
can, you know you can, l know
you can -— you must.”

Finally, Kentucky governor
Martha Layne Collins is another
woman cited this year for her
achievements as a mother.
Reflecting on that, Collins
speaks for many women when
she said, “l’ve had many titles,
but the most important one is
mother."

Kissinger has the heavy weight of
the consequences of war to carry,
but so do over a million veterans all
around the country. The regular Gls
do not have Kissinger’s option to
make statements on all the net-
works. They take what they had to
live through with strength and dig-
nity. While he worries about how
history will remember his part in
those times, our veterans carry the
memories of death more directly
than Kissinger.

To protest to the government and
to the politicians, to make the big-
gest show possible was the only
course available for people to try to
stop the war. Still, to insult or hurt

stand that people had to try every-
thing they could to stop the war, but
it should have been without attack-

oppositions to the state's military
policy, where the streets are quiet
and protests are not seen, and I will

stayed at home, I can’t find much to
be respected in the actions of the
“hawks" who called for more war,
more killing, and I have little respect
for the people who weren’t inter-

idea oftrying to stop a war cannot be
dishonorable, but many of their

Profit On Parking

It seems too convenient to me that
the university seems to profit from
every parking restriction the city
imposes on Oakland streets. Many
examples are available: I will name
two. ,

When Joncaire Streetiin south
Oakland was made a no parking
zone for no apparent reason, the
Panther Hollow parking lot at the
bottom of that hill ‘suddenly
increased its rates. This little-used
lot was suddenly desirable, and Pitt
wasted little time in sticking it to the
driving commuter.

Trying To Break Tl1rough/ Vicki Zeitner

Cost-Effectiveness of Higher Learning

As a transfer student from a com-

‘munity college, I must say that

choosing a university from which to
cam my B.A. degree was one of the
most difficult decisions I have ever
had to make. While considering the
usual criteria of major and minor
programs, certificates and informa-
tion facilities, I discovered that there
were more aspects of a school to
comparatively evaluate than I had
realized. One such aspect, and one
which greatly influenced my deci-
sion to come to Pitt, was grading
policy.

Unlike many other Pennsylvania
colleges, Pitt provides the option of
a credit/no entry grade. For me, this
meant that I could register for
courses in which I was interested
without fear of failing if the course

proved too difficult or time-
consuming. Likewise, I could use
this option toward fulﬁlling my alge-
bra requirement without destroying
my grade point average. This system
provides a tremendous advantage
for grade-conscious students who
wish to get the most from their edu-
cation, and it also acts as an incen-
tive ’for students to take courses
which seem beyond their ability to
complete successfully or which are
unrelated to their major. ‘

Last fall term, for example, I had
wanted to register for French II] but
knew, since it had been two years
since I had passed French II, that I
could not successfully pass the third
level course with any degree of reten-
tion without-first reviewing second
level material. Because my French II

He’sa famed biologist.

credit had been transferred, I could
not repeat that course at Pitt and
receive credit or a grade. I decided to
register for French II under the
S/NE grade option so that I could
attend the class, along with five oth-
ers I had enrolled in, as preparations
for French III. I went to the class
regularly, completed the assign-
ments, and at the end of the term
when I had five finals to study for
and three papers to write, stopped
attending class and skipped the final
exam with no penalty. I enjoyed the
class and benefited greatly from the
review. I also learned some new con-
cepts that my French Il class at the
community college did not cover.
Rather than being discouraged from
continuing my study of French, the
S/ NE system relieved me ofthe anx-

iety of possible failure. For myself
and probably many other students,
grades are important but should not
be a source of anxiety.

In my opinion, a truly knowledge-
oriented university (which we all
wish Pitt to be) should allow as
much flexibility as possible for stu-
dents to pursue courses of study not
required by their major degree pro-
gram. The general education
requirements normally fulfilled in
the freshman and sophomore years
do provide a wide variety of courses
to choose from, but mostly are
lower-level introductory courses
which tend to be densely populated
and very boring. Rather than be
confined to rigid schedule planning,
students should be encouraged to
take more I00-level courses in inter-
disciplinary fields without fear of

poor or average grades which would '

reflect poorly on his or_her tran-
script. Good grades are most impor-
tant in one’s major field of study,
and that is where strict standards
should be set.

The S/NE option is unique and
extremely valuable in the freedom it
allows. The administration’s pro-
posal to eliminate this grading alter-
native over the summer months
seems to be an attempt to further
define our education along the lines
of bureaucratic efficiency. Were stu-
dents asked to define what educa-
tion means to them? No. Were
students asked if they thought the
S/NE option provided a valuable
service? No. Was an evaluative sur-
vey taken of the number of students
who have used this grade option
over the last few years and why? No.
The only criterion considered by the

MAY 8, I985
administration in its‘ proposalﬂwas
cost. The question of whether the
costs of maintaining the S/NE
option outweigh the educational
benefits it offers has not been ade-
quately debated because little, if
any, probing into the actual and

potential use ofthis grade option l1_' <7.
been done. Few issues affect stu-

dents more directly than grading
policies. In proposals to alter the
present system, students should be
among the first consulted.

This administration seems to be
developing a habit of making deci-
sions on academic policy without
consulting students whom these
decisions will more directly affect. If
the university administration refuses
to offer students the opportunity to
participate in the making of these
decisions,
demand consultation. 1, for one, am
not pouring my scarce resources into
this institution so that the admini-
strative bureaucrats can tell me what
should be done with them. I am
thankful for those few professors of
FAS who are taking students’ inter-
ests to heart.

Pitt’s academic policies should
induce a well-rounded rich educa-
tional experience for educations
sake. The more I hear of academic
policies being re-oriented toward
cost-effectiveness, the more I begir’
to question my reasons for going to
college in the first place. If my pri-
mary goal was to save money, I
would not be here. It would be more
cost-effective for me to go to the
library after work and read. It may
take longer, but I could educate
myself for one tenth the cost of
tuition. ‘

Prince running out of gas?
The four songs on side two
systematically dispel that
notion. By this point Prince
has abandoned his "concept,"
whatever it may have been, so
in that sense the albumihas
already, failed, but by the end
of "Temptation," the album's
eight-and-a-half—minute show
piece one has forgiven the
records inconsistencies.
”Temptation" is even more
effective because it comes
roaring out of nowhere after
the quiet fade of "The Ladder,"
a pleasing slice of modern gos-
pel co-written by Prince's
father, John L. Nelson. ”Temp-
tation" begins with the
breathy chant, Sex! Tempta-
tionl

Lust!" and only gets

   

steamier from there. It's clas-
sic Prince. His blood-curdling
shrieks recall "Darling Nikki,"
but the eroticism of "Tempta-
tion" is far from gratuitous:
Beneath all the heavy breath-
ing, Prince is seriously trying
to reconcile his sexuality with
his love of God, and the_results
are amusing and touching.
Near the end, the howling gui-
tar subsides and Prince has a
dialogue with a booming voice
that can only be You-Know-
Who:

VOICE: That's not the way
it works. You have to want it
for the right reasons.

VOICE: You don't. Now die.

Day, along with the announce-
ment that he will cease touring
for two to three years, Prince
seems to be dethroning him-
self, removing his crown for a
while and passing it on to
someone else. He is stepping
out of the spotlight both liter-

ally and in the sense that his

new music isn't the flashy,
attention-demanding screech
of his prior albums. Around the
World in a Day is, in a phrase,
and indulgence. It is Prince no
longer trying directly to please
his listeners but to satisfy his
creative impulses and retain
his audiene only incidentally.

In recent weeks, the issues of
image, who should pay for what,
who should take the blame for fal-
tering, and what can be done to
improve the Pittsburgh entertain-
ment scene have arisen in the minds
of area residents. Centered in the
controversy is the city amusement
tax. This tax is paid by all people
attending an entertainment function
in the city of Pittsburgh. The ten
percent tax on ticket sales has enter-
tainment producers grumbling, yet
it contributes too much to the city
budget to be abolished without
creating another source of revenue.

The furor was started when
Edward DeBartolo, Sr. called a
press conference to request the abo-
lition of the amusement and parking
taxes, among other things. Since
then, many members of city and
state government have come forth
with proposals to rectify the situa-
tion. However, as County Commis-
sioner Barbara Hafer’s Press
Secretary Don Eld pointed out in a
recent interview, “There’re two
edges to every sword  ”

Rich Engler, of Dicesare-Engler
Productions believes that unless the
tax is abolished, Pittsburgh will be a
second-rate city. “Removal of the
tax would have an immediate
effect,” he said in an interview yes-
terday. “It would put Pittsburgh
back into the limelight."

MAY 8, 1985

hinders

Engler says that bands such as thew
Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd, and sol-
oists such as Paul McCartney do not
come to Pittsburgh because the
profit margin is not high enough. He
said that in any concert he books for
the Civic Arena the band will want
85 to 90 percent of the profit. In
order for Dicesare-Engler to make
any money on a show, they must
keep the amount they offer a band
lower than other cities, such as
Cleveland. He says that were the tax
abolished, it would leave the organist
zation l0 percent more money to
bargain with while attempting to
lure bands to Pittsburgh.

According to Engler, dropping
the tax would permit his group to
bring the shows like the Rolling
Stones and Pink Floyd to the city.
As it is now “  we get all the week-
nights. The bands can make more
money playing Friday and Saturday
nights in other cities.” He believes
that soon after one or two of the
bigger names in the entertainment

industry came to Pittsburgh, other 
acts would soon follow in pursuit of '1

the profits.

Engler says that Dicesare-Engler
has gone to city government in the
past in attempt to alter or abolish the
amusement tax. but that efforts have

been “pretty much shrugged off.” He
says much of the reason there has
been so much attention focused on
the issue of late, and a good reason
why there may be a change, is that
organizations are threatening to
leave.

The second side ofthe sword is the
fact that the amusement tax makes
about $4.6 million of the city’s
annual budget. This money is in turn
used to subsidize the $1.8 million
dollars the city spends annually on
Three Rivers Stadium. This subsidy
is a key factor in keepingthe Steelers
and Pirates in the city. Also,

$361,000 is spent on the Symphony,
Ballet Theatre, Opera and Civic
Light Opera. A

MAY 8, l 985

The mayor’s office contends that
unless the state legislature comes up
with another source of revenue that
all people in Pittsburgh and the sur-
rounding area can contribute to, the
amusement tax must stay.

Caliguiri has stated that all those
who partake in the enjoyment of the
entertainment in Pittsburgh should
bear the burden of paying for it.
Were the tax abolished, he fears that
only those who live in the city would
be paying for the priviledge of hav-
ing professional sports and enter-
tainment, while many others would

partake of it.
The most recent attack on the
amusement tax was begun by

Edward DeBartolo, Sr., owner of
the Pittsburgh Penguins and Spirit,
and controller of the Civic Arena,
which is leased to him. He said in a
recent press conference that since
assuming ownership ofthe Penguins
and Spirit, he has lost $25.5 million.
He stated if further losses were to
continue, he would have to consider
selling or moving the teams to
another city.

He asked that the city abolish
both the amusement and parking
taxes and for help in financing the
debt service which costs him about
$700,000 per year. In addition, he
asked for the creation of an annual
fund of $500,000 to $600,000 for
capital improvements to the arena,
and that the city drop its law suit
against him for pulling the Maulers
out of the city. Shortly after the
press conference, the city announced
that they would be dropping the law
suit.

Finally, DeBartolo set a deadline
of July I5 for selling l0,000 Penguin
and Spirit season tickets. After this
deadline, he said they would reeval-
uate the other requests based on
tickets sold. In the 1984-85 season.
the Penguins sold 5,500 season
tickets, and the Spirit sold 1,800. If
the ticket sales are not up to par, and
the requests pertaining to the taxes

and other aid are not close to resolu-
tion, DeBartolo said he would have
to consider exercising other alterna-
tives — these other alternatives
apparently being selling or moving
the team.

City Councilman William Robin-
son has made an attempt to reduce
the amusement tax. Last week, his
proposal to City Council that the tax
be reduced from ten to five percent
was voted down. Council members
feel that the tax cannot be reduced
until another form of revenue for the
city is found.

In an interview yesterday, Robin-
son said that he will introduce a bill
to council that would institute the
enforcement of amusement tax col-
lection. “According to the Finance
Department of the city, the onl-y way
for them to know if you must pay an
amusement tax is if you come in and
register,” said Robinson. He is form-
ing a committee that will be investi-
gating who is avoiding the tax. He
said that when the committee has
completed its findings, he will take
the information to the Finance
Committee and compare his find-
ings with theirs.

Robinson said he can understand
why they should avoid cutting the
amusement tax. “They (the mayor’s
office) believe that the city is grow-
ing as an amusement center. If the
amusement tax is cut, and the city

entertainment quctlity

‘grows as expected, we will be losing

money." He said his research shows
that future entertainment revenue
will be decreasing, and that there
must be a change in the tax system.
“I would like to lower the amuse-
ment tax, step up on the collection of
those who owe, and give bonuses [to
those who pay early].” Currently,
the city gives any organization a one
to three percent return on the money
owed in amusement taxes, accord-
ing to Robinson, if the payment is
made before the due date.

Robinson’s proposal will include
a fine of $100 per day after the due
date for organizations who choose
not to pay the tax.

The University of Pittsburgh’s
Pitt Program Council, the organiza-
tion that arranges student activity
events on campus, is affected only
on occasion by the amusement tax,
according to Gina Miller, advisor
for the group. She said that they
must pay the fee only when applying
for a Public Safety Permit. The per-
mit carries with it a registration form
for the amusement tax service and it
must be completed when registering
for a facility that holds more than
1,000 people. As with other organi-
zations, Miller said the tax cuts
down on the profit margin, thereby
taking away money that might be
spent on other events.

ing which time they released
two independent albums; and
they take their name from a
line from F. Scott Fitzgerald:
”In the darkest part of the
mind, it's always three
o’clock.”

Their songs sound as they
are intended to sound —
smooth, well—crafted and con-
sistent, not unlike the
Go—Go’s. That consistency,
however, is a problem. After
listening to this record at least
three or four times in its
entirety, I couldn't name
offhand more than one or two
songs that made a lasting
impression. None of it is
unpleasant, but as side two
nears its end, you almost find
yourself wishing for some
unpleasantness.

pany, the Firm has created a
fairly respectable debut album,
with the single ”Radioactive.”
The band performed only their
original songs during a two-
hour set at the Civic Arena last
Sunday. The show was occa-
sionally brilliant, due to the
stage presence of Page.

The root of the problem is
the vocalist. Quercio sings
seamlessly but in a breathy,
lilting, unbelievably fey
manner. He sounds like an 11-
year-old boy imitating Art
Garfunkel with a heavy Eng-
lish accent. This wouldn't be so
awful if he wasn't an Italian kid
from Los Angeles.

Another point of contention
is the keyboard player, Mickey
Mariano, who seems to serve
no purpose beyond ”filling
out” the band's sound. Only
one song, ”Knowing When
You Smile,” has an interesting
keyboard fill. The rest of the
time, Mariano just tootles in
the background, sounding like
a half—baked Rick Wakeman.

of him and adding another gui-

‘down, content for a time to let

Rodgers take over. Eventually,
he got bolder and came out to
the front, shyly introducing a
few songs and thanking eve-

flashy sequined outfits of the
'70s, when Robert Plant, lead
singer of Led Zeppelin, rarely
wore a shirt at all. Page has
toned down his act a bit, wear-

was clear why the 12,000-plus
throng was there.

The show, however, came
up short. Consider two things:
Led Zeppelin bypassed Pitts-
burgh in two concerttours
over the last eight years; and
Page, who is considered a rock
legend to many, has been a
recluse in England for over
four years. Does it seem rea-
sonable for the fans to expect
just a little taste of the old
tunes? True, it might be bor-
ing for Page to strike up ”Stair-
way to Heaven" one more
time, and it's understandable
that he would want to try new
things. But what else is there
for a new band to perform if
they only have one album?

To flesh out the show, the
band performed ”The Chase,”
which is, at this stage, work in
progress. In addition to Page
having his solo, bassist Tony
Franklin and drummer Chris
Slade also had their chance to
be in the spotlight, which was
an outrageous waste _of time.
What could be more boring
than a bass solo? Only one
thing: a drum solo.

For all of the show’s excess,
though, seeing Page live made
the rough spots and disap-
pointments worth overlook-
ing. With some impressive
laser effects reminiscent of the
Led Zeppelin movie, ”The
Song Remains ~ the Same,"
Page, in an eerie green shower
of laser light, used the famous
violin bow on his guitar to
prove that he is still the King
of Feedback. Shambling
around the stage with his long
sweaty curls in his face, he
arched his back, turned and
twisted to the bend of the
notes coming out of his guitar.

In addition to performing
tunes from their debut album
(”Radioactive" and ”Satisfac-
tion Guaranteed” being the
most well—received), the band
performed a blues version of
Foghat’s ”I Just Want to Make
Love to You.”

It was a goodlshow, but it
left everybody screaming for
more.

Desperately Seekin

by Leslie M. Bennett

Orion Pictures has come up
with a tasteful entree for this
spring’s movie menu at seem-
ingly the absolute minimum
pricing. Produced with a bar-
gain budget of only $5 million
and spiked with two of the
sauciest dishes around
(Rosanna Arquette and
Madonna), Desperately Seeking
Susan is fast becoming a chef's
surprise at the box office. Its
comedy-of-errors plot of mis-
taken identities may be one of
the oldest recipes in the book,
but because of some subtle
satiric twists and identifiable
social undertones, the film is
fresh and, more than anything
else, fun.

Roberta (Rosanna Arquette)
is an undesperate, ordinary
housewife stuck in the medi-
ocrity of microwave ovens and
Julia Child. Her only interest is
in reading the personal ads in
The Daily Mirror, particularly
those addressed to a hard-to-
locate Susan.

Susan (Madonna) is
extraordinary and opportunis-
tic woman of the world and the
streets of the lower East Side
of New York. She lives out of a
round black suitcase full of
used and outrageous clothing
and out of the pockets 0
friends and acquaintances.

Between this pair of unlikely
femme fatales, the story serves

up a spicy set of ingredients
which combine for a screwball
murder mystery of who's who
and whodunnits. Roberta gets
a bump on the head in her
attempts to meet her admired
Susan and, because of a ques-
tionable case of amnesia, is
mistaken for everyone from a
murderer and a prostitute to
Susan herself. The chaos is
deepened when the real Susan
hooks up with Roberta's drab
husband (Mark Blum) in try-
ing to find his missing wife.
The plot proceeds in all the
typical ways, but it remains
amusing throughout with the
help of some decently simple
characterizations. Aidan
Quinn becomes Roberta's

   

hassled lover while he thinks
she is his best friend's girl-
friend. Laurie Metcalfe plays
Roberta's gossipy sister-in-
law, and comedian Steven
Wright is her flat-faced fling.

What gives Desperately Seeking
Susan its freshness and keeps it
from falling into the endless
pit of adolescent films is proba-
bly its feminine influences.

lead roles, but it was also writ-
ten and directed by women:

more articulately than men.

male-dominated film industry.

As for Arquette’s and
Madonna's performances, it's
hard not to let Madonna steal
the show. She's a performer
from her bleached hair to her
red painted toenails, born to
seduce with a sideways glance
and a smirk. She even succeeds
in allowing the audience to
forget that she's a singer
(although her song ”Get into
the Groove” is played in the
background of one bar scene)
and letting everyone know
that she can act. Although
comparisons to Mae West or
Marilyn Monroe are inevita-
ble, she's got an aloof style

that's inimitable. Who else
could walk around in men's
boxer shorts eating cheese
puffs with such a look of lei-
sure and power of persuasion?

Arquette, whose previous
roles in Baby, It's You and The
Executioner's Song and her more
recent role in Lawrence Kas-
dan’s Silverado, proves that
she's a hot item in Hollywood.
Considering who she's up
against in Desperately, she
comes off as strongly, albeit
less interestingly, as the
protagonist.

It's hard to argue whether
Madonna's name is selling this
film, but it would bela shame to
brush it off as a teen flick
because it really isn't.

Miller still uses the finest
ingredients and brewing skills.
It contains no additives or
preservatives.

And Miller still comes in
the same clear bottles.

For the same clear reasons.

Hoop team improves grades

By Jim Urban
The Pitt News

One month after the fall term’s
disastrous 1.77 QPA for the men’s
basketball team at Pitt, Coach Roy
Chipman hired Tom Price as full-
time academic advisor to the basket-
ball team and already the dividends
have begun to pay off.

After only one term, the team as a
whole has already raised the team
QPA to a respectable 2.1. In addi-
tion, Price reported that seniors
Chip Watkins, Charles Thompson
and Andre Williams are scheduled
to graduate at the end of this sum-

'mer.This is encouraging news for a

center of controversy earlier this

revealed as a part of a report by the ‘

University Senate Council’s athlet-
ics subcommittee.

Leading the way for the team,just
as they did on the court, were start-
ers Joey David and Charles Smith.
David, the Big East Scholar-Athlete
of the Year, carries well over a 3.5
QPA, while Smith, the Big East
Freshman of the Year, finished with
a 2.86 QPA for his freshman year.
Price believes that Smith will inﬂu-
ence the other members of the team.

“The players compete on and off
the court,” said Price. “They talk
between themselves and tell each
other how they are doing.” When a
player the caliber of Smith produces
in the classroom, others have a ten-
dency to follow the example.

Price also reported that of all the
students placed on academic proba-
tion at the end of the winter term,

only three percent were from the
student-athlete population at the
university.

Coach Roy Chipman was
unavailable late yesterday to com-
ment, but the veteran coach has to
be pleased with the progress that the
team made during the winter term.
Chipman will be welcoming several
new recruits next season, but Price
doesn’t foresee any major problems
that these student-athletes will expe-
rience gradewise.

The study habits of the Pitt men’s
basketball team suffered drastically
during the past season. During the
Big East schedule, Pitt only played
one away game on a weekend. The
other six away games were played
during the course of the school
week, which encompasses a two-day
trip for the student—athlete away

Pittsburgh track fans will have
their first chance to see the Pitt track
team this weekend when they host
the Pitt Invitational at 10:30 a.m. on
Saturday at Pitt Stadium.

The Panthers, under Coach John
Vasvary, are fresh off a solid per-
formance in the Big East champion-
ships last weekend at Villanova.
‘Pitt's men came in third, and fresh-
man sensation Lee McCrae was
named outstanding runner at the
meet.

McCrae, an indoor All-America
from North Carolina, placed in four
events, including a first-place finish
in the 200-meter dash.

Joining Pitt at the meet will be
runners from West Virginia Univer-
sity, Marshall, Akron, Carnegie-
Mellon and Robert Morris. Despite
the stiff competition, Vasvary said,
“I think we'll be ready to run well.”

Pitt will honor the only two
seniors on the freshman/ sophomore
dominated team, Mike Rihtarchik
and Pat Moran. Pitt also features
some exciting young runners in Cal-
vin Holmes and Tim Manes. The

meet is free to the general public, so.

ance in Pittsburgh.

Freedline, picked up $7,000 for
his finish, which included a last-mile

ish line, vaulting him out of sixth
place and into fourth. It also made
him $3,000 richer than he would

Shuck emerges from the shadows

By Jim Urban
The Pitt News

Back in 1983, Connellsville High
School of Fayette County, western
Pennsylvania, was the center of a
ferocious recruiting war. Two highly
regarded athletes, West Turner and
Charlie Swink, both linebackers,
attracted recruiters from all over the
nation. It was here that a success
story began, not for Turner or
Swink, but rather for Pitt tight end
Dgwe Shuck.

Shuck grew up in the small town
of Dunbar, Pa., which lies between
Connellsville and Uniontown.

“I played sports all my life,” said

Shuck, “but football was the sport I
really excelled in.”
A And how. Shuck evolved from
that unknown blocking bandit in the
game films to the winner of the Ed
Conway Memorial Award in Pitt’s
spring drills this past spring.

“My strong point was always
blocking,” said the sophomore tight
end. “It was just a matter of me
working on my pass patterns.”

Shuck spent countless hours on
the Cathedral lawn and the Towers
patio last year catching passes from
anyone who would throw to him.
His development as a tight end was
revealed last year in the Panthers’
season-ending victory over Penn

State. Shuck was listed as a starter
for the first time in his collegiate
career and left no one disappointed.
Playing most of the game, Shuck
and the rest of the offensive line
dominated the line of scrimmageras
the Panthers reeled off a 31-1 l
victory.

In spring drills, Shuck, under the
direction of the new tight end coach
John Montgomery, finally forged to
the front, running neck-and-neck
with incumbent Clint Wilson. When
Wilson went down with another foot
injury, Shuck picked up where Wil-
son left off. The Conway Award,
which is presented to the most
improved player on offense and
defense in spring drills, was present-
ed to him at half time of the annual
Blue-Gold game at Pitt Stadium,
capping a successful spring for
Shuck.

What lies next year for Shuck
remains to be seen. Should Wilson
return in full health, Shuck will see
his playing time cut in half, but he is
not worried.

“I’m not worried with [playing
time],” said Shuck. “We just want to
return Pitt to where it belongs in the
polls.”

As for his old teammates from
high school, Turner is currently
listed as a starter at the outside line-
backer position, but reportedly his
attitude has gotten in the way. The

West Virginia pre-season guide said,
“West Turner has the capacity to do
whatever he wants to when he sets
his mind to it."

Swink, meanwhile, spent an
unhappy year in Happy Valley
before he packed up and joined
Shuck here at Pitt. Swink has moved
to nose guard during spring drills
and is listed as a non-scholarship
athlete, but that could change in the
near future.

In the meantime, Shuck will con-
centrate on hard work over the
summer and will look forward to
showing up his old teammate when
the Panthers travel to West Virginia
on Sept. 28.

“I can't wait to play against
Turner,” Shuck said. “We’ll pay
some debts next year.”

It will definitely be a different
story from his high school days
when Shuck takes the field next
year. Facing Big Ten powers Purdue

and Ohio State right off the bat will '

present Shuck and his teammates
with a challenge parallel to last
year's.

“We just have to make a commit-
ment to excellence this year,” said
Shuck. “We can't let a bad start
snowball into a bad season, should
we start out slow. We are a lot more
experienced this year, and I think
that we will be able to handle some
situations that we failed in last year.”
