Tuck‘ Shop Prices

by Frank Langsdale

More than 10,000 students
spend an average of 20 cents a day
for food in the University tuck
shops and cafeteria.

Although many students just
drop in for, a ﬁve-cent cup of
coffee or an eight—cent bottle of
milk, others may buy two twenty-
cent sandwiches, a ﬁfteen—cent
salad, a ten—cent piece of c-ake
and a twenty-cent milk shake. But
Whatever the student spends, he
admits that the tuck shops are
.mighty convenient.

Price Complaints General

A rather general complain,
“mainly prices” according to Mar-
shall Levy, president of Student
congress, was placed in the sug-
gestion box some time a-go and
was acted upon by Congress. Levy
wrote a letter to Miss Ruth Cram-
blet, director of University. food
services, asking her to appear be-
fore Student Congress so the prob-
lem could be discussed properly.
Miss Cramblet, who has been with
the University for over four years,
felt that Congress could have been
a little more speciﬁc, for there
was no date set for the discussion.

Through \ several medium, a
meeting was ﬁnally-arranged. Bill
McElwain, advisor to student pub-
lications, Tillie Sanker, News ed-

itor; Marshall Levy and Miss-

Cramblet met last week in an at-
tempt to iron out all complaints.

The topics discussed were both
general and speciﬁc. They ranged
from the amount charged for
meals in the cafeteria to the price
of pie, ice cream and sandwiches
in the tuck shops.

Miss Cramblet, who is only an
employee of the University, pa-
tiently explained each. item. ‘To

Curie
Mother’s Steps
To F ame, Pitt

Women’s day speaker Eve Curie
is following her mother’s foot-
steps to Pitt. Mme. Marie Curie
was the ﬁrst woman to receive an
honorary degree from -the Uni-
versity. , -

President John G. Bowman:
then Chancellor, presented the de-
gree of doctor of laws to the
world—famous discoverer of ra-
dium in» a ceremony at Soldiers’
and Sailors’ memorial, M_ay_ 26,
1921. l V ‘

. At the ceremony, the women of
America presented’ Mme. Curie
with a single gram of radium, val-
ued at $100,000. The money for
this gift was collected in one-dol-
lar donations from women
throughout the United States, for
the purpose of furthering Mme.
Curie’s research at the Radium.
Institute in Paris.

This presentation of the gram
of radium makes one of the most
stirring. scenes in Eve Curie’s bi-
ography of her mother. The sensi-
tive warmth and sincerity of this
‘biography marked Eve Curie as an
outstanding writer. Translated in-
to 24 languages, “Madam Curie”
was hailed by critics as a great

Like her sisters, Eve had re-
jected the idea of living on her
parents’ fame. Before becoming
an author, she was a concert ar-
tist and a music and theater critic.
Her second book is “Journey
Among Warriors,” a best-seller
written after a ﬁve-month tour of
principal ﬁghting fronts during
the war. ’ ‘

Now an associate of the Paris
Presse, Mlle.” Curie served with
the Voluntaires Francaises for
two years. At present she lives in
New York.

Panhellenic Ball
Postponed ’til June

Panhellenic Ball, annual spring
formal for all sorority members
and their dates, has been postpon-
ed. Originally scheduled for next
Friday, April 25, the dance will
be held on June 7 at the Schenley
hotel.

Contract for the dance was sign-
ed last summer, and, due to a mis-
understanding with the hotel, an-
other event was scheduled fbr
t-he evening of the 25th.

Bill LeRoy and his orchestra
will play for the post-exam dance
that will begin at 9 p.m. and end
at midnight. Charmaine Blatt is
the chairman and Carol Becker is
business manager. 

' Plan Awaits

Final Okay

By Chaf1cel.lo1~ 

The_Pitt Chest, a plan to con-
solidate all charity solicitations
into one blanket drive each sem-
ester, was established Tuesday by
vote of Student congress.

Students and faculty have felt
the need for this sort of system
for some time. Although substan-
tial donations will be required to

ﬁll thequota, it is believed that,

that the convenience of the plan
will counterbalance that.

Instead of contributing to four
or ﬁve individual drives each sem-
ester, students will give to one
drive which. includes allof the
charitable organizations.

Although the resolution to ini-

_tiate this type of drive wasipass.-

ed, the vote was close. It. was sug-
gested that students might not be
able to give a whole semester’s
donation at one time. Another
argument was that members of the
faculty andstudent body may not

care to contribute to some organi- ,

zations represented in the drive,
or may wish to give to only one
charity_ This would not be possi-
ble under the Pitt Chestprogram,
since the money will be divided
among all the groups equally.

The ﬁnal decision to support this
plan was based on the advisability
of dispensing with periodic drives
in order to initiate the more effi-
cient Pitt Chest system of a single
drive each semester.

Present plans call for a special
committee, composed of student
and faculty representatives, set up
to decide which organizations shall
be represented and how the money
will be divided. ..

_ Adrienne Aldisertwas appoint-

ed tomake a tentative program»

concerning the make-up of the
committee and date of collection.

After complete plans have been
drawn up by Student congress,
the plan will go to Chancellor
Fitzgerald for ﬁnal approval.

The cry for a Pitt student union compar-
able to the city-block sized affair at some

of the midwestern campuses has been Voiced,

repeatedly throughout the life of stu.dei1t

_ activities.

Last week, Chancellor Fitzgerald an-
_nounced the ﬁrst step in the process of ans-
wering student wails when he shooed dean
of men Biddle to the annual meetingof the
Association of College Unions at the Uni-
versity of Illinois. Pitt, without the services
of a union house, is an associate member.

That plans for the erection of a student
union here exist isevident. Dr. Fitzgerald’s
record on the campusof the University of
Iowa proves that he is the man who will

’ do it. During his term there, the_ Chancellor

was instrumentalin obtaining one million

dollars in ‘contributions for the establish-‘

ment of a similar activities building.
But, the men who hold the strings on the

University ’s money bags are admittedly right

when theysay that theunion must wait.

First on the construétion agenda, according '

to the statements made at student-faculty
committee gripe meeting last December’, is
a ﬁeld houseclarge enough to accommodate
basketball and indoor track. Another ﬁrst
is the completion, of long term-plans for
building dormitories on campus. . . '

_P.it’t students, for the time being, must

content themselves with green. glances at.

the canipiises of the Big Ten. It’s almost a
surety that no student oh campus today will
see a student unionhere. .

But, then, there ’s always the second gen-
eration.

- Fate of Greece Rests *0

With UN, Students State

That a strengthened United Nations will save Greece from
the destructive effects of the present economic crisis and the
resultant civil war raging there was agreed upon by two col-
lege students who came t0.America from Greec this past. year.

Both students, Louis Zapas and Panayotis Psiroukis, lI1-
terviewed separately, said that intervention in Greece by any
country was dangerous, not only for Greece, but for the future

 

peace of the world.

Louis Zapas, 22, a sophomore 3

in chemical engineering at the
University of Pittsburgh, said,
“UN should have power to dis-
solve all organizations and give
a political amnesty to all those
who are in the mountains and
who are. in jail. The UN could
then sponsor a new election and
a new government in which all
the Greek people take part.”

Zapas, an American citizen,
came to this country seven months
ago. He was in Greece during the
time of fascist occupation. After
the liberation he served with the
American Transportation Com-
mission, 1418 division, and was
in charge of civilian personnel in
Athens.

Stating that from his experi-
ence in Greece after the libera-

tion, the only evidence of foreign‘

intervention in the civil war state
was that of England, Zapas cited
the military interrelationship of
England and the Greek Royalists.

VNot only did the English help the

Royalists in the battles following
the liberation,\ Zapas said, but
they supplied the Battalions of
Security, a military organization
which collaborated with the Ger-
mans during the war.

“During the occupation the Ger-
mans used the Battalions of Se-
curity. After the liberation the
British used them,” Zapas stated
wryly. “I saw a British boat ﬁll-

’ ed with arms. I found that these

 

arms were to be given to the
Battalions of Security. I was
amazed myself when I discovered
this.”

The other student, Panayotis
Psiroukis, an advanced freshman
at Carnegie Tech, favored UN in-
tervention in Greece to clear
away any foreign powers. “I
would like the -UN to set up a
temporary democratic govern-
ment, then the Greeks could have
a free election. Economic aid from
the UN would be necessary for
reconstruction.”

Psiroukis, 22, a Greek citizen,
was in the Greek navy serving
with the British admiralty in the
Middle East during the war. Since
then he has traveled through
Greece to Syria and to Egypt. He
was sub-editor on a Greek news-
paper in Egypt.

That Greece is not the only vic-
tim of dissatisfaction- and civil
strife was signiﬁcantly pointed

Along with women’s elections
last week, the ﬁve members of
senior court for the school year
1947-48 were named. Last Thurs-
day, the WSGA judiciary group
met for the first time and elected

Zapas PSll'OllklS
out by Psiroukis. “Look at the
countries in central Europe,” he
said, “you will see the same things
happening.”

Psiroukis believes sincerely in
the settlement of Greek problems
and in the ability of the Greek
people to help themselves after
Greece is peaceful again.

“One day Greece will be free-
totally free I mean. I know that
day will come. The people of
Greece will help themselves in
the reconstructioneof their. coun-
try.»

Rehearsals Begin
For Players Latest

Rehearsals for the Pitt Players’
newest oﬁering, “Joan of Lor-
raine,” got under way this week
as director Michael McHale made
ﬁnal adjustments in the play’s
cast.

The cast as given by McHale has
Martha Morrison in the. title role,
Jack Abramson as Masters, the
director, and Joseph Blair, the
story’s stage manager.

The rest of the parts, as well
as that of the title character, are
really dual roles, since all the
players in “Joan of Lorraine”
portray actors in a ‘play within
a play’ idea. "

“Joan of Lorraine” is slated for
production May 8, 9, and 10, dur-
ing Spring Festival week.

“The response to Traditions

our speaker, Eve Curie, has been
announced I feel sure interest is
even higher. In answer to the
many requests by men for tick-

Open House Again
Part Of Festival

Following a special meeting of
the Spring Festival committee and
sorority representatives, it was
decided that Pitt’s sororities will
sponsor Open House, Thursday,
May 8, between 3 and 5 p. in. Due
to housing and ﬁnancial condi-
tions, there was much discussion
as to the advisability of an Open
House, but the committee ruled
to uphold this annual tradition.

Falling in line with other activi-
ties scheduled during Spring Fes-
tival, the sorority event offers the
entire student body an opportu-
nity to become acquainted with
the different campus sorority
houses. Arrangements are being
made for those sororities without
houses. Dancing and bridge will
round out the festivities in each
house.

History Pays

Two years ago today on the island of le
Shima a group of  from the 77th Infantry
division placed aiwooden sign near a very
ordinary ditch. It was a very ordinary sign,
too, but everything on it said much:

“At This Spot The 77th Infantry Division
Lost A Buddy——Ernie Py1e——-18 April 1945.”

I guess the 77th was speaking for the whole
army and navy, too, when they could drag
him away from a fox hole. Maybe that’s why

The movies in the early stages of the war
portrayed the GI as a pre-adolescent with a
terriﬁc inferiority complex——a gullible fool
who was awe-stricken by the sight of notable
personalities. V

Sometimes they presented the invincible
warrior who died with a smile on his face and
‘used his last breath to mouth some heroic
balderdash. It remained for Ernie togive the
true portrayal: A

“This guy should have been at the Signal
Center in Tunisia when the censors butchered
one of Ernie’s columns,” he said. “Ernie rais-
ed the roof. It was on battle fatigue, and after
we ﬁnally got him quieted down, we asked him
to read it.

“You not only saw the soldiers, you could
hear them: Soldiers with cracked nerves wan-
dering around a battleﬁeld, not knowing who
they were or where they were; soldiers cry-
ing like babies; soldiers staring with empty
seared eyes; soldiers screaming at the sky.

‘fBroth'er, we sat there so tense, I thought
‘something would have to break. Ernie really
wanted that one to go through. He thought it
might show the people back home what War
was.” . _

Someone in Italy said Ernie looked like
Gandhi with clothes on. He never carried more
than 112 pounds on his ﬁve foot, eight-inch
frame. But he never asked any special favors
and he stayed right up there where the action
was ﬁercest.

It was no life for a young man and it was
murder for a man in his forties. But Ernie
was a part of it. That’s what he said when
he went to the Paciﬁc:

“I certainly am not going because I got

An ex—doughfoot from the 1st
Division emphasized Ernie’s posi-
tion as the GI spokesman. “What
do you think of this,” he asked.
“Imagine them wanting to build
a million dollar memorial to Ernie.
Why, every Combat Infantryman
Badge is a memorial to Ernie.”

Ernie was the ﬁrst to advocate
extra pay and the badge (silver
riﬂe on a blue background) for the
combat soldier.

Everyone who read him felt
they knew him. He became a part
of his column because he gave
away a part of himself whenever
he wrote. Ernie never‘ could sit
‘down and bang out a story. He
wrote-and rewrote and even when
he ﬁnished, he wasn’t satisﬁed.

He didn’t think the now famous
column on the death of Captain
Waskow was any good when he
wrote it." e

When the Germans bombed
Paris, ‘Ernie felt that he had
enough. He just had to leave.
He “had it.”

He had so many close calls that
he always referred to the latest

one as “my escape.” One time in '

North Africa the Stukas came
over to dive-bomb and strafe and
Ernie went piling into a fox hole
one step behind a soldier.

After the raid was over, he
nudged the GI and said, “Whew,
that was close, eh?” The soldier
didn’t answer. He was dead. ’

So Ernie used up all his chances
and died as unspectacularly as
the ungloriﬁed infantrymen he
loved. Nothing was more ﬁtting
than to have the infantry lay him
to rest. I wish the Gls who placed
the sign ‘near that very ordinary

Phi Eta Sigma

Offers Frosh
Tutorial Aid

Winston Ames, chairman of Phi
Eta Sigma’s registration commit-
tee, announced Wednesday that
applications of freshmen for the
Phi Eta Sigma tutorial service
will be accepted April 18-22 in
the oﬂice of clean of men, 801 C1.

The service is offered to all first
and second semester freshmen
looking forward to blueprint F’s.
Sessions will begin April 23 and
continue through May 30.

During the six week period, en-
rolled students will receive at
least one hour a week of intensive
tutoring by a qualiﬁed advanced
student in the subject desired.
Tutoring will be carried on be-
tween 8:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m.,
and will not interfere with regu-
lar classes.

Before the tutoring service was
suspended in 1942, it proved more
than successful in helping to
bring up the grades of Freshmen
according to the statements of
deans, professors and instructors
in all schools.

Jerry Obert, president of the
freshman honorary, emphasized
that this is not a gloriﬁed cram-
ming course. “Our tutoring pro-
gram is designed to relieve the
professors who are unable to give
special attention to the needs of
individual students, due to the
present crowded conditions.”

Snapping back after last weeks
faculty open house (where the 15
fraternities and the 15 faculty
squeezed easily in and out of the
6 houses) the fraternities have all
laid great plans for the remainder
of their social calendars.

The Kappas and the Delts un-
daunted by the poor turn ‘out at
the IF open house, set the date
for the annual Kappa-Delt Facul-
ty Reception for Wednesday, May
14 at the Delt house. A ,

The well trained pledges of
TPA gave a dinner for the ac-
tives and alums last Wednesday.
(After the dinner they took on an
additional course in the form of
Phi Kaps). Their election results;
Pres. Cass Boyle; Vice Pres. Ann
Monteverde; Sec. Pat Williams;
Treas. Margie Dixon.

The Phi Delts said they might
be able to dig up a combo for
their tea dance with the KKG’s
and some unknown (at this mo-
ment) sorority for Monday night.
The Kappas don’t mind music-—
we haven’t heard from the other
bunch. A

The Phi Eps killed three birds
with one tea dance last Tuesday
as they invited Delta Chi Rho,
AEPhi, and Phi Sigma Sigma to
join them at the Web Hall. The
men still outnumbered _the wom-
en 2 to 1!

and Jim Ludwig

The big wheels of ADPi are
Joan Hall, Norma Blosser, Doris
Dudley, and Pat O’Connell, (list-
ed in order of power). Other new
operators took over for the Phi
Sigs. They are Shirley Ringleheim,
Dianna Bernstein, Zelda Kernis,
and Harriet Miller. Officers, offi-
cers, oﬂicers—where do we enlist_-
ed men come in?

The Theta Chi’s celebrated their '

birthday at the Roosevelt Hotel
last week with a Founders’ Day
banquet (the 91st) featuring Mike
l\/lilligan as guest speaker.

And to complete the list of new
ofﬁcers among the women, the
Phi Mus present this group: Pres.
Boots Robins; V. P. Jeanne Dor-
ﬁeld; Secy. Sara Gillingham; and
Treas. Elizabeth Cooper. To honor
these gals and the others, the super
Sigs are throwing a tea dance their
way.

The Metropolitan Y will be hon-
ored (used loosely) with the Phi
Gams (see what we mean) and
the Beta Sigs next week when the

gals “Stoop to Conquer” at a
Dessert dance.

so tonight. And the PiKA hay-

Grid Practice

Long hours of practice, daily
scrimmages and calisthenics make
the going tough for the candidates
of Coach Mike Milligan’s grid
eleven, but they seem to be pay-
ing off.

Paul Rickards, ace passing star
from Wheeling, W. Va., shows
some of that old form that made
him a sensation at Pi‘-.."in 1944.
He has been hitting receivers con-
sistently with his passes
should provide the aerial attack
that last year’s squad missed.

On the other end of the passes,
Jimmy Joe Robinson, outstanding
sprinter from Connellsville, shows
dazzling spring-season speed in
nabbing the tosses. Working out
of the single wing, Robinson look-

ed right at home as a running

back.

Among the fullback candidates,
Louis Melillo, Kittanning, Bob
Becker, Pittsburgh, and Lindy
Lauro, last year’s regular from
New Castle, are the leading con-
tenders. Mark Maystrovich, Nor-
and Henry Duran, Kulp-
mont, two of the new squadmen,
show promise.

Bill Bruno, returning star from

Penn, leads the list of quarter-

back candidates. Pete Daley,
Brownsville, Pete Fuderich, Ali-
quippa and Bill Hardesty, Lang-
ley, round out the other leading
contenders. Joe Cherol of Youngs-
town, and Mike Ianni, East Deer,
are two men among the newcom-
ers who are attracting attention
in practice.

Ted Geremski, Braddock, is the
top end among ‘the newcomers
to the Panther aggregation. Ted, a
stocky -six-footer, sports plenty
of speed and aggressiveness.

Timmiin’s*Credits M illighn

For His Return To Pitt

Bobby Timmons is going to wait and see how it turns out.
Quite a. few eyebrows were raised when the former Panther
end relinquished the head coaching spot at Indiana State Teach-
ers college to become an assistant at. Pitt.

But Timmons put it this way, “Mike Milligan was the
deciding factor in my returning to Pitt. I don ’:t know whether

it’s better being head man at a¢

small school or an assistant at a
large school. I’ll have to wait and
see.”

However, those who know Bob-
by aren’t a bit surprised. He has
the knack of attempting——and
usually completing -- . diﬁicult
tasks. As a player, he and Joe
(Muggsy) Skladany paired at the
ends on the powerful 1933 Panther
eleven.

Plays in Rose Bowl

During the regular season, they
lost one game, a 7-3 decision to
Minnesota. On New Years day,
they opposed Southern California
in the Rose Bowl.

Ten years later he went into the
Navy and nailed down an end
berth on -the Iowa Seahawks.
“The toughest phase was getting
into condition,” he explained.

“Basic training helped, but, like
most mature players, my playing
was with the head rather than the
body.” ~ _
Timmons chose a Seahawk
team mate as his top player.

Dick Todd Best

“Incidentally,” he said, “I’ll take
Dick Todd as the best player I
ever saw. He’s a great:«competi-
tor and is always in shape. Not
only that, on or off the ﬁeld he is
a great fellow.”

Currently, Todd runs at half-
back ‘for the Washington" Red-
skins of the National Professional
Football league.

If he can lick the housing prob-
lem. Timmons will ,move his fam-
ily to Pittsburgh this summer. At
present he is living with relatives
on the North Side.

As Pitt Mittmen Open Campaign

Coach Ralph Mitterling and his

The probable battery is catcher
George Matich and pitcher Deryl
Calder. Professional scouts have
dangled contracts in front of the

tall, slim pitcher, but he has de-.

Meanwhile, he hopes to put his
effective assortment of pitches to
work in chalking up a few Pitt
victories.

If Mitterling decides on a last
minute pitching change, the choice

Cancer Committee
Continues Drive

The nation—wide campaign to
ﬁght cancer is well under way in
Pittsburgh, and will continue un-
til April 30 for those who have
not yet contributed.

Pitt students, too, can help save
lives by mailing contributions to
‘Cancer,’ Pittsburgh.

Part of the money collected is
to be used in Pitt’s own Medical
center. Funds will be utilized by
the Falk clinic in the Cancer Pre-
vention and Detection depart-
ment.

“We are not asking you to con-
tribute to a charity,” said Jona-
than S. Raymond, chairman of
the local campaign, “we are ask-
ing, you to save lives~—perhaps;
your own lite.” ,
