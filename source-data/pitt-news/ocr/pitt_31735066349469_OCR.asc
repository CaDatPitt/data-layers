Anti-tuition hike

SGB Pledge

BY LISA RUBENSTEIN

The Student Government has
pledged active support of the
Student "Coalition Against Tuition

>1 Hikes (SCATH) in a unanimous
'te at last night’s Student

Government Board (SGB) meeting.

“The coalition is a good vehicle
to develop strategies to combat a
possible tuition hike," SGB Presi-
dent Barry Weisband said.

The Board agreed to send
representatives to SCATH meet-

, ings. (See story, page 3)

The SGB also announced a forum

on faculty unionization will be held

against a tuition hike.

FAS Deba

BY CRIS HALL
Charges of grade inflation
(over-generous grading) were de-
bated yesterday at a Faculty of Arts

, and Sciences‘(FAS) meeting, but

no action was taken on a proposal
to curb the increase in A’s and B’s
at Pitt. '

A report by an ad hoc committee,
chaired by chemistry professor
Lawrence Epstein, charged the
recent steady increase in the
number of high grades was
“detrimental to the educational

. process, to society as a whole and

most of all to the student.” The
report urged Pitt faculty to limit the

full-time undergraduates for edu-
cation-related needs. A maximum
of $100‘can be borrowed from the
loan for a period of no more than
three months.

The guidelines also restrict a
student from borrowing from the
fund within 90 days of repayment
of a previous loan.-

“The fund is designed to provide
for a maximum turnover of money
for students,” Director of Student
Activities Dan Meloro explained.

The emergency loan fund is an
outgrowth of a plan initiated by last
year’s Board.

Meloro said an initial $1,000-

would be made available for the
fund through the University Con-

tingency fund. He explained Vice-

Chancellor of Business and Finance
Joe Dutton would provide $5,000

_per year for three years, leveling -

the fund off at $15,000.

f‘The first 5,000 will not be
available until July 1, but the
$1,000 will cover the fund until that
time," Meloro said.

In his report, Weisband express-
ed doubt over Pitt's inﬂuence in the
Senate budget hearings he attend-
ed in Harrisburg on Wednesday.

‘,‘It was a formality for the sake
of public appearance,” he said.

Weisband is scheduled to attend
the House budget hearings on
Monday.‘

The board also is scheduled to
begin interviews next week of
applicants seeking the vacant SGB
slot. Nineteen students have
applied for the position.

amount of high grades to half the
total grades given.

It was noted that the proportion
of high grades peaked in the fall of
1973, when 61% of all undergradu-
ate grades were above the C level.
Epstein said the ratio has been
decreasing since and that “the
situation seems to be healing
itself.” '

The committee's report met with
opposition from. “several faculty
members, and at one point the
debate caused one committee
member, physics professor E.T.
Newman, to threaten resignation
from the committee if what he
termed ‘fﬁlibuster tactics” were
continued.

Economics professor Herbert
Chesler questioned whether the

"increase in the number of high

grades was due to grade inﬂation
or the recent restructuring of the
undergraduate curriculum.

“The data presented does not
present a compelling case for the

‘grade-inflation allegation,” Ches-

ler said.
“-The opportunity for students to
elect courses on their own has been

greatly broadened in recent years. «
The committee did not seem to take
these structural changes into
account.”

Chesler noted a student current--

ly is permitted to take as many as’
60 credits in his major, in which he
presumably does well; in 1968-69,
the year used as a model by the
committee, the total was only 39.

He also pointed to the elimina-
tion of the language and English
competency requirements as fac-
tors that could increase the amount
of high grades without incurring
grade inﬂation. ~

“There are relatively few cases, "

where a faculty member awards

indiscriminately high grades,” he A

said. “I am strenuously opposed to
a quota of any kind.”

Chesler also said the faculty was 
placing too much emphasis on the , . "A

grades themselves.

‘‘I reject the premise that we
have a responsibility to assign
grades to students in the same
manner as a butcher assigns

‘grades to meat.

Pitt Prof Says Blood

Stains Reveal Sex, Race    

BY BOB COHEN

A Pitt professor said he has

developed a method to determine a .l

person’s sex, race and drug habits
from blood stains as small as a
quarter and up to several months
old. .
According to Dr. Robert Shaler
of the chemistry department,
determination of sex involves a
technique that measures the ratio
of the male and female hormones in
the blood. To date, the

effectiveness has been 90%, he

said.

Shaler credits Carl Stuver,
assistant director of the County
Crime Lab; with aiding him in
developing the technique. i

The method analyzes genetic

factors in the blood, such as the 

“Gm" factor. There are 24
different kinds of Gm.

Livewire: Student Groups Risk Loss of Mail 

BY GEORGENE KALEINA

Student organizations that don't pick up their mail in
Student Union boxes risk losing use of the mail slots.

In response to a complaint by-the Undergraduate
Women’s Union (UWU), Gus Tytke, a University postal
clerk. said student groups must pick up their mail or

cancellations will be made.

UWU members said they sent bulk mail for advertising . .
f the Women’s Cultural Festival, held in January, and
eceived it back undelivered a month later. “We received a
memo dated Jan. 19,” one members said, “If we would
have gotten it back sooner, we could have sent it out in time

UWU members said they were not aware that a.
' requisition must accompany all bulk mail. '
“We probably would have gotten more people at the
conference if those ﬂyers had been sent out,” anothen
UWU member said.
After checking into the long delay of the bulk mail
return, Tytke said that according to the mail clerk, UWU
did not pick up the mail from Jan. 19 until Feb. 23.
“This happens frequently with a lot of student groups,’
Tytke said. “From now on, all the mail sitting in the boxes
for a period of time will be sent to Terry Milani (Student
Union manager) and he'll arrange the cancellations.”
Tytke said there is usually a clerk checking the boxes

makes a mistake when awarding a
grade." Chesler contended.

Economics professor David
Bramhall agreed with Chesler. “It
is wrong to assume, as this report
does, that a grade measures or
mismeasures student quality," he
said. '

Bramhall said, “This sounds like

a policy for a technical institute, not
a liberal arts college. We should

“the faculty's feeling on this

of 600 faculty members."

The committee concluded grade
inflation has caused, among other
things, misinformation on stu-
dents‘ capacities and deﬁciencies,
since grades have been improving
while" Scholastic Aptitude Test
scores have been declining.

The committee report also
recommended that any student
who takes more than one-fourth of
his credits under the credit-no

mittee recommended by continued
and expanded—should forfeit the
right to an overall QPA at
graduation. The committee would
leave the decision of whether the

‘course is to be graded in that

manner, however, up to the

instructor.

The committee also saw prob-
lems arising in the provision of

 

student evaluations to graduate
and professional schools, honor
societies and potential employers.

An ' amendment to _ make this
realization part of the committee’s
ﬁnal resolution failed in a floor
vote, as did a motion to table the
resolution. The vote on the motion
to table was 22-22, and a move to
refer the entire question to the full
FAS membership by means of a
mail ballot was defeated.

The tie vote was not sufﬁcient for

passage.

Since a quorum was not present,
the meeting was adjourned.‘

nounced a special FAS meeting will '

  Student Groups Join SCATH

BY CHARLES w. OGG

Thiiteen Pitt student organiza-
tions formally endorsed the Stu-
dent Coalition Against Tuition
Hikes (SCATH) at a meeting last
night.

The organizations pledged to
back SCATH’s standagainst tution
hikes, reductions in educational
programs and cutbacks in ﬁnancial
aid. '

There was a general consensus
that SCATH should make an
attempt ‘to attract more students,
including those not involved
already in student organizations.
On March 16, a teach-in will be

/f'f,]1eld to inform students on what
they can do to prevent a possible
tution hike.‘ . '

In addition to the teach-in, there
were a variety of suggestions made
about possible strategies SCATH
could use. Many students
proposed SCATH extend itself into
the community, enlisting the
support of such organizations as
trade unions and Common Cause.

Some of the struggles engaged in
by other state-related colleges and
universities were outlined, with the

‘proposal that SCATH link up with”

these groups in a statewide and
possibly a nationwide drive to

eestablish education as a major

1,. rﬂiority in American society.

Graduate student Linda Nyden,
emphasized that an attempt should
be made to reach the black and
working-class communities, claim-
ing that an advance in the cost of
education would hit them the
hardest.

Stefﬁ Brooks, Pitt undergradu-
ate and member of the Young
Socialist Alliance, cited estimates
that the decision in New York City
to end open enrollment would cut
black enrollment by two-thirds.

Concerning SCATH’s stand

‘against cutbacks in. educational

programs, several people expres-
sed fear that along with tuition
hikes there will be cutbacks in the
black studies and the women's
studies departments.

Points to which student-s must
apply pressure to prevent tution
hikes, as proposed at the meeting,

include the Pitt administration,

Harrisburg legislators, Pitt’s Board
of Trustees and the corporations
with which Boardmembers are
associated.

“The major corporations should
be forced to pay an education tax,”
Nyden said. ‘

sing SCATH are the Student

 Healing Fresh Wounds

Though 18 students ran for six Board seats in last rnonth’s Student

1/ a Government Board (SGB) election, 19 now are seeking the seat left

vacant by Sue Tumer’s resignation two weeks ago. .
The method to this madness is fairly evident. After all, who would

7  rather not accede to office on the basis of an interview rather than

through the rigors of petitioning, hanging signs, appealing to voters

. 2 and securing endorsements?

SGB President Barry Weisband and the ﬁve Board members have

:1 I j 7 their work cut out for them because ﬁve of their six votes are needed to
 approve the new member. '

. With Turner’s ill-tirned resignation, the rightful holder of the seat

- shouldbe Cliff Protzman, the next highest vote-getter. But he has

decided not’ to apply.
Serious consideration of Joe Gronsky therefore will facilitate the best
choice and also avoid a deadlock.
v~ In light of the topsy-turvy presidential race Gronsky originally

if I‘won——-then lost when a new election was called—-there’s no doubt an
_ offer _for him to take a seat on the Board would bind the wounds left by

last rnonth’s appeal and oounterappeal crossﬁre. V
Even after he exhausted the procedure of appeal ‘and knew his,
.victory would not be stayed, he urged support for Weisband and
pledged his own efforts for the Board in the coming year.
It is this sort of commitment and good will that places Gronsky’s

, candidacy above the rest.

The Naive Trustee

The caustic remark by Pitt's new Board of Trustees member Dr.

' David Hombeck that “Tuitions at Pennsylvania’s colleges ought to
I ‘remain as they are-—relatively high and proportional to the increases in

costs,” is ignorantly out of place on the Pitt campus and serves to

advertise only that Hombeck is a greenhom in his new role. ,
What makes Hombeck’s statement even more outrageous is that

he’s Pennsylvania’s deputy secretary of education and is serving with

. I the trustees as the representative of Secretary of Education John
Pittenger. ‘ i

Perhaps Hombeck’s been away too long from the paying side of
education to have any sensitivity for those who have to foot Pitt’s
‘ever-increasing bills. ‘

While there may be some validity to the concept that tuitions, should
rise with a school’s costs, the notion that they should be “relatively
high, ” as Hombeck boldly suggests, smacks of exclusivity and elitism.

Hombeck very well could get away with such a statement elsewhere
in the state (say, at Penn) or at another Ivy League campus. But‘
because of Pitt students’ socioeconomic background, which is largely
Working-class and ﬁrst-generation college, a distinct naivete of at-
titude on his part comes through. .

Students and families at these other schools have plenty of options
they can forego in the event of skyrocketing tuitions; that winter

What the Media Don't Know  

BY BILL MOORE

When the American media are at
a loss to_ explain‘ something
adequately, too often they avoid it

and communicate something they’

understand. ,

We——today’s 18-to-22-year-olds
—-are the phenomenon the press is
avoiding most.

Time magazine was taken in by
the late-'60s rhetoric and ran story
after story on “The New Youth,”
“The Sexual Revolution” and
“The Disillusioned Children.”

Time was convinced something

major was occurring back then and,

that it would change the face of the
world as far as youth was
concerned. .

But now it is becoming increas-
ingly obvious we aren’t all sleeping
with each other, aren't all hooked
on marijuana and aren’t all
dropping outi to raise hogs
somewhere in the Midwest. ’

‘ BEHIND THE LINES

It was a media ‘event cleverly
staged -by ‘our older brothers and
s'isters——and even some of us—to

see how much ‘the press would _,

swallow. i
Nixon and his Cambodia were
real. They were the proverbial

_ straw that broke the camel's back

and set off the campus riots and
concurrent peaceful revolutions.
College youth of the late '60s and
early '70s reacted to the evil of the

Indochina wars in the only way they

could—by making enough noise to
attract CBS cameras so their
parents could see just how upset
they were. And the parents did
see. . ,

Seen One, Seen Them All

Editor’s note: This is the fourth
and final statement of pro- and
Pitt

uled March 9 and 10.

BY THE TIF STEERING
COMMITTEE

In the‘ three previous issues of
The Pitt News, each of the
contending unions has attempted
to establish its superiority over the
other two. Common to all three, is

,'the blithe assumption that union-

ism under Public Law 195 will
enhance the status of the Pitt
faculty, if not the whole academic
community. Beyond this the
unions have tried to create the
illusion that unionization is inevit-

- able. Some faculty members who ,

are skeptical of the alleged benefits

T, of unionism may have been

persuaded that we will have a
union, like it or not, so that the real
problem is to choose the least
objectionable of the three. For
those colleagues we have GOOD
NEWS which may help to clarify
their choice. ,

First, the inevitability of union-
ism at Pitt is a myth. In fact, there
is good reason to believe that, if
each eligible person votes his or
her convictions. Pitt will not be
unionized. Unlike Temple, Pitt
ranks among the 51 leading U.S.
universities by virtue of its

-admission to the Association of

American Universities (AAU). Not
a single AAU institution has been
unionized. Elections, similar to
those facing us, have been held at
four AAU institutions: Michigan
State, Syracuse, N.Y.U. and
Nebraska. In every case the NO
AGENT position won. Last week

by a strong NO AGENT vote (NO
AGENT 634, AAUP 503) and
N.Y.U. rejected the second attempt
by the local AFT group to unionize
their campus (NO AGENT 479,
AFT 333).

It is a simple fact that there is
presently no suitable model for
predicting all of'the consequences
of unionizing an upper-tier univer-
sity such as Pitt. The attempt to
introduce Temple as a bellwether
becomes progressively more irrele-
vant the more closely it is
scrutinized.

Second, contrary to the claims of
the rival unions, there is good
reason to expect that. in practice,
each union is about as good or bad .
as the others. Although unioniza-
tion of four-year colleges and
universities is _ a fairly new
phenomenon, several signiﬁcant
and scholarly studies have been
completed on the consequences of

from the most recent (1975) of

of the union is one of the least

“We believe that the least

Letters tothe Editor  

Reader Raps
Trustee Column

After many years of being
associated with the University and
more closely over the past several
years, I feel it is my duty to respond
to the recent article “Meet the
Board and Their Own Bosses.”
Having read The Pitt News through
many years, I_‘h_ave refrained from
commenting on many articles
which I personally would have liked
to do. However, in the belief of a

 society such as ours, which is based

on a free press, everyone has a
right to express their own opinion.

Having worked with most of the
members of the Board of Trustees

,through the years, I believe The

Pitt News and the writer of the
article does a disservice to the past,
current and future members of the
Board.

The University has a long history
and Ihave been fortunate to have
worked with the Board during a
period of one of the most troubled
times for the University. Without
the Board's hard work, dedication
and understanding, there is some
question as to whether one of the

fﬁoldest and greatest universities
 "could have survived through that

troubled period.

It is unfortunate the Board does
not get the accolades it so
justifiably deserves nor can it
express its accomplishments with-
out criticism that it is extolling its
own virtues. I

Unfortunately, many are un-
aware of the fact that the members
of the Board give of their own
valuable time with -no remunera-
tion. Through their generosity and
assistance, the University has been
successful in developing endow-
ments, gifts and grants in the

Important Dates:

 

' Open to all Pitt underg

may not have been possible. As a
result of this generosity, the
University has been able to

maintain the cost of education at a ,

reasonable level so that those who
are worthy and who do not have
sufﬁcient means can receive an
education.

One should bear in mind that the
members of the Board have

. reached their current status in

society as a result of hard work,
dedication and the perseverance to
succeed. Having individuals with
such virtues as Board members has
been a factor in the success of the
University.

In closing, this University, its
past and present administration,
faculty, staff and students can be
justly proud to have had members
of the Board such as we have had
and currently have. I trust the
University will be so rewarded in
the future. _

It is unfortunate that many fear
and criticize what may. be consid-

ered the unknown such as many_

who are unfamiliar with the Board.
The members of the Board are a
known quantity and are human
beings to whom wecan aspire in
the pursuit of their much-valued

virtues.
To the past, present and future

Boards, forgive them for they know
not what they do.

In Defense
Of the Greeks

I am writing in reference to the
article entitled “Yes and No for
Greek Life” published in The Pitt
News on Jan 30. The author of the
article states that Pitt fraternities
do not ﬁt the description of Phi
Beta Kappa offered by Baird’s
Manual of American College
Fratemitites. As stated in the
article, Phi Beta Kappa was the
first Greek-letter fraternity in the
United States. The article fails to
state the Phi Beta Kappa was
founded so that men could gather
and discussthetopics of the day.
Phi Beta Kappa was founded
during a time of political turmoil
and unrest. Student life in the
colonial colleges was strictly
regimented; any suggestion of
creative self~expression was sub-
ject to suppression and punishment
by the college authorities. It is little
wonder that some students, ﬁnding
they shared common beliefs and
ideals, "created a secret society to
discuss burning topics of the day in
the security of their secret oaths. It
seems that comparing an academ-
ically oriented fraternity such as
Phi Beta Kappa to a present-day
social fraternity is totally unfair.

  I  ::+ebiaaiy27, 

Today’s social fraternities do not
provide “organized friendships,”.
but rather‘ provide organized
functions from which friendships
may or may not develop. By joining
a fraternity, one is not buying a
friend, but rather increasing the
potential of making friends. Being
a member of a _Greek organization
does not mean that you immediate-
ly have 50 new friends, only the
opportunity to develop 50 new
friendships if you so desire.
However, being a ‘member of a
Greek organization does not mean
that you must love everyone in the
group, It is impossible for all the
members of any group to mutually
love eachlother. What one ﬁnds in
a Greek organization is mutual
respect, as well as love in some
cases.

In the article, Richard Giles
states that “Frats also seem
artiﬁcial. It’s a lot of people that
get together who are insecure and
need an organized group to get

through.” Mr. Giles, you are
entitled to your opinion that
fraternities seem artiﬁcial. How-

ever, you can not justify your
remark that fraternity people are
insecure and need an organized
group to get through. Fraternity
men represent about two percent of
the male population of this country
and an interesting fact is that these
same men are leading the country.
About 80% of the executieves of
the 500 largest corporations in
America are fraternity men. Mr.
Giles, how can insecure men who
constantly need an organization be
leading America?

The statement in the newspaper

that “frat war_s__ar'e_ childish” is

questionable because iI7hav_e, never
heard of‘ such a war. Fratemities;

be like if the fraternities and
sororities decided not to build

would wonder what had happened
to school spirit. I'm sure this would

affect future alumni involvement-_ 

with the school.

Fraternities, particularly the it 

groups at Pitt, should not be
evaluated on the basis of rumors or
misconceptions that have been

handed down. The best way to-

evaluate them is to get ﬁrst-hand

' My last column examined the
social composition of the Pitt Board

5 of Trustees——the highest policy-
‘making body in the University. We
 ,_,saw that the Board is made up
 7 primarily of bankers and corporate
 T'directors. We also saw that the
"people who rule Pitt also control

the "industries, public-service or-
ganizations, utilities, research in-
stitutions, hospitals, banks and the
centers of Pittsburgh.

national ruling class. The Mellons,
Scaifes, Hillmans and Heinzes of
Pittsburgh work together with the
Rockefellers, Du Ponts, Morgans,
and Kennedys of national prom-
inence.

' , People like these employ people
like us. That is how they make'a
living. And they do not want us to
be protected by unions. Unions
give workers things like a better

standard of living, medical beneﬁts

and job security. Unions force the

' bosses to dip into their fat proﬁts to

pay for adequate protection for
‘workers. The bosses do not like

this: they’ll do anything they can

to protect their bank accounts.
Let's look at a case in point.
Since the early '60s the
nonprofessional hospital workers at
Presbyterian University Hospital
and Western Psychiatric Institute

"and Clinic, who are Pitt employes,

had attempted to afﬁliate with
Local l199P, Hospital Workers
Union. They continually were
denied a union election by the
hospital administrations and the
Pitt Board of Trustees. In the late
60s, the struggle by the hospitals
workers heated up, and there were

 ,protest activities against the

University. The high point of the
drive for an election occurred in
January, 1970, when the house-
keeping and dietary employes

staged a sit-in at Chancellor
Wesley Posvar’s ofﬁce. The Board
of Trustees, pressured into re-
sponding by these actions, made
the
employes already were represented

by Local 29 ofthe Building Services-

Employes Union." This came as a
surprise to the workers, who
wanted to be represented by Local
1199.

The hospital employes fought for
an election until 1973, when the
Board ﬁnally conceded in the face
of intense public pressure; Elec-
tions were scheduled for March '2,
1973.

The University made an im-

mense effort to prevent Local 1199‘

from being elected. Tons of
anti-union propaganda ﬂooded the
hospital corridors, shrieking-

lame argument that the‘

against "outsiders" and prevent-
ing employes from working togeth-
er in the “Pitt family."

At great expense, the Board of
Trustees hired William Hannan, an
experienced strikebreaker who had
just fought a union strike at A&P,
and made him director of employe
relations. But no matter how hard it
tried, the Board couldn't prevent
the hospital workers from selecting
Local 1199. The story doesn't end
here.

Immediately after the elections,
University lawyers appealed to the
State Labor Relations Board to
cancel the results, but their case
was dismissed. The University
appealed again, and again the case

~ was thrown out.

Finally, Pitt took it to the State
Supreme Court, where it is now.

Applications for enrollment in the Program in Early Childhood Education (N K-3 Certifi-

Students should have completed 60 credits of course work, have an academic concen-

Since this program can accommodate a limited number of students, individual inter-

The Board argued that the
employes bargaining unit was
unfair, since it didn’t include all
employes. including professionals.
Obviously this would have weak-

ened seriously the bargaining
power of the nonprofessionals.
This particular struggle of

employes to unionize illustrates the
slick delaying tactics. the utter
contempt for labor’s view and the
CllStOl'IlOn ofthe.real issues that are
hallmarks of the University's
“conccrn" for its employes.

» The current faculty unionization
effort shows that some things don’t
change. In June, 1974, Pitt faculty
members and graduate employes
ﬁled for an election with the State
Labor Relations Board under Act
195. This meant that at least 30%
of the faculty and 30% of the
graduate employes favored a
union. Usually, the Labor
Relations Board makes a decision
on proposed union elections within‘
a few months. According to certain
union leaders, the Board of

Trustees, through the Pitt admin-
istration, kept_delaying the hear-
ings, and the ﬁnal decision was
handed down just recently, only a
year and a half later. These
hearings were the longest in‘the

‘history of Act 195.

The Labor Relations Board
actually made two decisions. First,
it carved out ﬁve areas in the
University in which union elections
will be held. Faculty members
ﬁnally will be able to_ decide on
-unionization themselves. '

The second decision, though,
was a setback for the unionization
struggle. It says that although
graduate employes are employed

ofﬁcially by the University (they do ‘

about one third of the work for
faculty. and teach 40% of the

Letter

I

classes), the University will not be
required to permit them to
unionize. The Board of Trustees
could grant an election tomorrow if
it wanted to. But consistentwith
its anti-union policies, the Board
will not permit an election for
graduate employes until it is forced
to.

So, although union elections will
be held for faculty, the University
salvaged a victory with the decision
against graduate employes.

One of the reasons the Board of
Trustees is able to use delaying
maneuvers and fancy legal tricks
with so much success is that no

-'1

expense is spared in hiring crack"

union-busting attorneys. For
instance, the Board has used the
infamous anti-union law ﬁrm of
Reed, Smith-, Shaw and McClay to
stop or slow down the current
drive. (There may be cynics who

question the Board’s decision tr?‘

spend hundreds of thousands 0
dollars on this ﬁrm, at the same
time raising tuition and cutting
back on educational programs.
Well, don’t worry: the Board is
getting our money’s worth. This is
the same law ﬁrm the Board used
to ﬁght the Sharon Johnson sex
discrimination suit.)

The decision by the Pitt Board of
Trustees that University employes
should not unionize is currently in
the best interests _of the ruling rich

. in Pittsburgh. But it is not in the

best interests of the rest of us, the
majority, who are workers and
students. What is in our interests
is to support full union rights for all
Pitt employees.

We have to act in our interestsjﬁg

not in those of a tiny clique of

I greedy power-brokers. We should

be running our education, and not
them. And someday, in the‘
not-too—distant future, we will be.

Research, Please

The article in The Pitt News on
Jan. 12 entitled “Big Hulk\B'ehind
a Desk” has to be one of the most
poorly written, nonobjective “stor-
ies,” and I consider it_ that, to have

appeared in your paperfor some-

time.

Gene Grabowski attempts to cast
a shadow upon _all athletes that
compete under the University

"name. His very ﬁrst mistake is to '

generalize about whom he is
speaking. He uses the term
“athlete” to refer to basketball and
football players when in fact the
implication from the reader’s point
of view is that he is speaking about
all Pitt athletes.

«A second mistake made by
Grabowski is to imply that an
athlete on scholarship, be it
football, basketball, whatever, has
it ‘~‘made.” I compete on the

University's track team and I can
assure you that any athlete here

' who is being paid for his skills

through a scholarship _does not
have it made. The student at Pitt
who is not competing for an athletic
team does not have to meet certain

'*.~.»..’.‘.

obligations, such as reporting foi'$'

team workouts at least ﬁve days a
week or traveling on the weekend
in order to compete. At times
obligations such as these are
a bother because, contrary to the

implications in your article, most of

the athletes at Pitt, including

‘ football and basketball players, are

pursuing an academic career.

The ﬁnal mistake I see in your
article is to imply that athletes are
here at the University just as'a
proving ground for their pro sports
aspirations. That assertaion is just
plain ridiculous because if you look
at the percentage of Pitt's athletes
that go on to earn their living as

§

pro athlete, then I think you’ll ﬁn B 9"

that there is no basis for that
assertion.

Mr. Grabowski, before writing
another article on a matter related
to this, please do a little more

"research on the topic you are

discussing and the people you are
talking about.

Cantini Demands Perfection

.0 42

BY SUSAN MANNELLA

Squatting on the straw seat of a
wobbly wood chair, Virgil Cantini
probably looks a lot like he did
when he was playing football for
Carnegie-Mellon University in the
'40s——a square, solid body, though‘
thicker now. He is trying to stand
on the‘ chair but can't get his
balance. He plants his right foot in
the center of the chair and tries to
steady it with his left; he jerks and
slaps his right hand against the
wall to keep from falling.

 , He tries again, adjusting his feet
'3 /%n both sides of the not-too-sub-

stantial seat—it's one of those
S-shaped structures‘that bounce
like a hobby horse when you plop
down. But when he lets go of the
wall, he nearly falls again. He
jumps down, jamming both feet on
the floor with a slight bend of his
knees and drags the chair over in
front of a patch bare of wall.

Cantini and his secretary Eva
Deebs are in Pitt-.'s Faculty Club‘to
hang eight paintings done by the
studio arts department faculty, of
which Cantini is chairman.

“Eva, let me see that one there.
No, no, not that one. The one -next
to it," Cantini says, pointing at a
.dark green painting of a woman.

 3‘. ‘Yes. Okay, how do you think that

an

I

 

will look here?" he asksas he leans
the piece rug-like
wallpaper.

Eva tilts her head to the side,
squinting with her left eye,
tightening her lips—“Yes, I
think,” she nods.

“I don't know," Cantini blurts
out before she ﬁnishes. “lt's hard
to tell until they're up. Here, hold
this a minute, will you?'.'

Cantini mounts the chair again
and when he has his balance, takes
the painting in both hands. They
look like an auto mechanic’s——

against the

 

‘ask-raw-.«.4oowoow>.ww>

broad with short ﬁngers. freckled 

 

and hairy,’ gray under his flat
nails. _

“Would you cut me two pieces of
that wire, please, Eva? About 12
inches. Don't you think that's
about the right height?"

Like a mechanic, Cantini works
with his hands. As a sculptor and
painter, Cantini is best known for
his enamel panels—the paint is
actually baked or blasted onto
sheets of metal in ovens at
temperatures as high as 1,500
degrees. The most outstanding
feature of his work is color.
Luminescent reds, ‘blues, greens
and yellows dominate.

“Any idea is a continuum—it
comes from‘ your parents, I guess.
My mother always had flowers in
the house. She would crochet all

kinds of things in the winter, ‘

beautiful colors and different
patterns," Cantini explains. His
voice isrough and still holds a faint
trace of Italian accent, though he
moved from Italy to West Virginia
when he was only ten. His th's
sound like soft d’s. “My parents
didn't program their children"-he
is one of ten children—“but you
are affected by these things."

Cantini himself is more colorful
than most suit-and-tie university
administrators. His purple, pink
and black print tie glows against
his bright yellow shirt. Neither
match his checked slacks or
mustard knit s_portsjacket,'~which is
missing a few buttons.

After he has clipped the green
painting to the wall, Cantini tilts
his head back a little to look.
“Okay, Eva. Let's try that large
one next to this and see."

Though Cantini is nationally
known, he is more popular around
Pittsburgh, where he has lived
since his days as aC-MU art major.
He met his wife when he was a
student.

says her husband never tried to
gain recognition for his work. “It's
just that he believes if you work
hard enough, even if you don't
receive some recognition, you will
at least improve."

Cantini admits the work does not
always seem worth the effort while

.he's doing it.

“Art isn't fun to make. I think
the fun is after the accomplish-
ment. You work and work at
something and when it's ﬁnished,
it's wonderful and you say, ‘Oh,
what I've DONE!!' " Cantini
explodes. throwing his right hand
up to punctuate the sentence.
“But how terrible it was," he adds,
his voice falling.

Cantini's hands move almost
continuously when he. speaks,
whether he is ﬁdgeting with his tie,

‘pushing back the few strands of

light-brown Vitalis-soaked hair that
stick over his eyebrows, or simply
adding to his spoken words.

“I did a mural for the new Law
Building this summer. That was
the most difficult thing I've done
because I'm working in ,a studio
where it's 110 degrees. But after a
while, you get acclimated to it. You
get used to being dehydrated.
Because at the end of every day, I
see that I'm closer to accomplish-
ing something I want to do.

“I always think art_remains a
mystery, even to the artist himself.

‘-When I was working on the mural,-VI

never saw the total thing. I was
working on the individual panels,
hoping it would hang together. I
never realized the enormous task.
Maybe it would have frightened me
away from it."

Cantini's , eyelids are barely
visible. He keeps his eyes wide
open and stares rightzinto the faces
he is talking to, except when a
question wrinkles his brow into a
deep VV. .

“When I finished and I saw it, I
said ‘Did I really do all that?’

Cantini stops to look. “What do

Cantini reaches up to the small
white spotlight in the ceiling. He

the canvas, but it won't budge. His
large ﬁngers fumble with the tiny
screws that hold the light in the
track, buthe can't loosen them. He
grabs the shade and tries to pull it
around, but it will not move.

is defensive about this.

To Lower State Drinking Age

BY DEANNA L. CONGILEO

Student apathy is part of the

‘reason legislation to lower the

drinking age has never been
approved by the Pennsylvania
State House, according to Assistant

Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs 1

William Markus.

“There is no organized effort by
students of any of the 10 schools of
the Pittsburgh Council on Higher

. ‘Education to lobby -in Harrisburg or

influence_ the votes of local
representatives, ’ ’ Markus said.

State Rep. Thomas E. Flaherty, a
Pittsburgh Democrat who voted
against‘ teenage drinking, said
most of his mail opposed -19-

‘ year-old drinking. The age group
little

affected by the bill did
counterlobbying, he said.

In state congressional sessions,
the Pennsylvania American Auto-
mobile Association (AAA) Federa-
tion and the state police lobbied
against under-21 drinking;

In 1973, the AAA presented to
Congress statistics gathered by the
state of Michiganwhen the legal
drinking age was lowered from 21
to 18 years old in early 1972.

According to this study, made by
the Michigan state police and the
Michigan department of state,
drivers involved in alcohol-related
accidents jumped 119% in the ﬁrst

year after under-21 drinking.

Two are skills oriented—analytic skill and
problem solving.

A key feature of the program is a series
of problem-solving laboratories in which
teams of students work on actual major
policy problems currently facing policy-
makers in urban government. Student
laboratory reports have included recom-
mendations for policy on urban neighbor-

The total accident increase of
Michigan drivers over 21 was

signiﬁcantly less than that of
teenagers, who drive more during
high-risk dusk hours and "absorb
alcohol more quickly than adults.

“Lack of experience, driving at
high-risk hours and quick absorp-
tion of alcohol can be a lethal
combination,” Jack Haver, AAA
spokesman for the West Penn
Motor Club, said.

“We are aware that minors
,disregard the present law and'are

seldomconvicted or even arrested-

for illegal drinking,” he said- “But
lowering the legal age potentially
will increase deaths.”

In 1975, Pitt ’ Campus Police
arrested 58 persons for public
drunkenness. - '

“These arrests were just the
hard-core cases. Usually wetry to
put the students to bed,” said Lt.
Sam Conti of the Campus Police.
“Teenagers are usually released
for a first drinking offense
anyway.” v -

Student apathy towards state
drinking laws may be caused‘by
law enforcement officials who allow
minors to drink illegally. Mean-
while, Pennsylvania congressmen
continue to defeat 19-year-old
drinking proposals.

Rep. Michael Mullen, a local
Democrat, opposed the last propo-
sal to lower the drinking age and
said he will vote against it again if

it is introduced during the 1977 '

session.

“My decision‘ was based on
personal views,” he said. “I don’t
think 19-year-olds are ready to

systems aren’t equipped for it.”

K. Leroy Irvis, state House
majority leader, opposes drinking
for everyone and voted against the
bill.

“I think Rep. Irvis would support
a bill to ban drinking for
everyone,” Irvis’ secretary said.
“He doesn’t smoke or drink and
dislikes attending social functions
where people do.”

The chances for legal 19-year-old

drinking were killed until at leas ‘,
1977 by the House’s last defeat; 01 5°’
' the proposal.

It fell nine votes
short of the needed majority.

House Liquor Control Committee
chairman Joseph Sullivan scurried
through the House seeking more
votes for the bill. He couldn’t
change enough minds.

Sullivan said, “I asked some

people why they voted against it. -

They didn’t seem to have an
answer.”

“Damn it, we’re sending these
kids miles away in automobiles to
other states, then they’re_ drinking

_ and driving back,” Sullivan said.’

Tavern and resort owners also
have been seeking a reduction in

Pennsy1vania’s drinking age fr?

several years. Resort operators i .35:-. "

the Poconos said they’re losing ski
business to resorts in New York,
where the drinking ag.e is 18.

Pitt takes no official stand on
19-year-old drinking and has done
no lobbying on the issue, Markus
said. Still, the University has not
allowed Uncle Charlie’s, a fast-food
operation in the Student Union, to
serve alcohol. Two taps are
installed‘ in the establishment,
awaiting the ‘19-year-old legal
drinkers.

‘‘In 1970, the University explor-

ed the possibility of a liquor license _

Control Board regulations, which
prohibit ,under-21-year-olds to en-
ter a liquorestablishment, the

would not be allowed ‘on the
premises.” ‘ ~

Legally, people under 21 aren’t

If you haven’t made it to the
Associated Artists’ Exhibition,
here’s further enticement. Wed-
nesday’s article reviewed three of
the five studio arts faculty
members displays in the show.
This piece continues with the works
of’ professors Larry Brown and
Girts Purins, as well as a sampling
of other outstanding pieces.

Purins uses the color and design
techniques he teaches to his
Slashes of yellow, red,
green, blue and purple whip across
his canvas at acute angles to the
gray-sectioned background this
This makes his canvas look like an
aerial view of colored lighning
beating down on a» city grid. As
expressed in the title—“Spatial
Composition No. l,” Purins’ main
concern is cgmposition of space
using primary and secondary
colors. But recognizing his
effective capture of city life’s
autonomous, fast-paced diversity-
Purins’ adds the concrete subtitle
_“The City” to his work.

In contrast to Purins, Brown
wants to get away from illusionisti-
cally representing space on two-
dimensional canvas’. Instead, in
“Ash Creek,” he displays “ac-
tual” space by hanging numerous
empty construction sheets together
in calendar fashion. The edges are
perforated and" cut in graduating
steps from the top layer to the last
sheet.

ln contrast, sculpture- and

painting-oriented professor Larry,

Brown gets away from the
illusionistic representation of space
on_ a two-dimensional surface in
favor of presenting real space. He
achieves this by hanging a number
of construction paper sheets
together in calendar fashion. The
edges are perforated and cut ing
raduating steps from the top layer
to the last sheet.

Girts Purins, a painting,‘ color
and design instructor, uses all
these elements in his abstract
“Spatial Composition No. l—The
City." p Splattered slashes of
purple, blue, green, red and yellow
section his gray background into

what appears to be an airplane- the paint slashes becoming boltso
viewed grid of the city. The city
blocks seem darkened by rain with

BY M. PATRICK MONAHAN

After an-initial listening to the
debut album of Paris, you may be
overcome by shock. Not solely
from the full, intense heavy metal
that dominates the album, but from
looking at the ‘back sleeve and
discovering the people producing

studio work, before'Paris happen-
ed. And from looking at their past
work, it’s surprising that they
would come into the arena of heavy
metal. An even bigger surprise is
seeing Bob Welch, playing lead
guitar, and composing and singing
all the cuts on Paris.

Welch used to play for Fleetwood

just an observer sitting in
judgment. Truffaut leads Adele
down a spiral with cinematic

mastery.. The climax of the ﬁlm is
the scene in which Adele, so drawn
up in her obsession, passes by the
lieutenant without a glance, even
when he tries to talk to her.

Adele H. is not going to appeal to
a lot of people. It's an absorbing
character studyof a person history
‘should not have forgotten so
quickly.

Degradation of women seems to
be in this season. But’then, when
has it ever gone out of season?

It's bad enough to/see misogyn-
ism paraded under the guise of art
when a Peckinpah or a Kubrick
does it, but when the only major
female director in the world does it,
it leaves a rotten taste in the
mouth. Of course, Lina Wertmul-
ler will say her Swept Away...By an
Unusual Destiny in the Blue Sea of
August is more political than
sexual, but the pat little myths are
too strong to be overlooked.»

Swept Away is a tale t_hat can be
taken two very different ways,
depending upon how you-look at
things. One version is that the ﬂick
is about the victory of the masses
over the corruption of the wealthy
few. The persecutedproletariat
has the chance to dominate and
persecute the capitalist for a
change. ,

Okay, that’s one way of looking
at it. Another is that man (that is,
specifically, the male‘ of ' the
species) has been put down by
women, who are corrupt, evil, etc.,
for a long time, and now he gets
back the upper hand. ’Woman, i_n
the meantime,ﬁnd tiue fulﬁllment
in being debased, slapped around
and generally bullied. Man is the
natural master of women, but
women are just ‘too weak to go
along with the idea.

Actually, the two themes are not
contradictory; it's just a matter of
which one comes across stronger.

Now to get to the actual plot.
Raffaella (Mariangela Melato) is
the bitchiest of rich bitches, blonde

and beautiful, who has hired a.’

yacht to entertain her friends on
the Mediterranean. Among her
employes is a rather belligerent

Her best work, though, is the
smaller, award-winning “Night
Watch." The piece sandwiches
velvety black between luscious
oranges and tempting reds in a way
that makes her colors ready to melt
over one another. '

realist work once again falters in

They ﬁnd

themselves adrift

when the motor on their dinghy
breaks down. Gennarino is not an
experienced-enough sailor to ﬁgure
out what to do, so they drift a
couple of days before chance brings
them to a desert island. Raffaella
is still playing the queen and

    

berates him constantly. He turns
on her, refuses to serve her any

more and ends up treating her,

much worse than she ever treated
her paid employes.

little ﬁlm that, while not the worst
movie this reviewer has ever seen,
is certainly on the Top 10 list.

Norma Jean purports to be the
story of the unnamed starlet (for
legal reasons) as a struggling
young actress before she changed
her name to that name that can’t. be

Norma Jean is a boring
succession of scenes that tell how
one woman is thoroughly tromped
on. Misty Rowe, who makes a
valiant attempt to put some life into
the leading character, explains that
the director wanted to portray the
unnamed starlet as the most
exploited woman in the world.
Perhaps. But she could certainly
qualify as most boring. '

and as for the music, would you
believe Lou Reed-like decadent
lyrics, set against a back drop of
Zeppelin-like heavy metal.

On Paris, Welch and his cohorts
have come up with an album of
brutal, precise heavy metal. The
lyrics are mockingly and at times
satanically dark, making it probab-
ly the best and certainly the most
interesting album of the year.

“Black‘ Book” starts off with
Welch’s newly charged guitar and
proceeds to damn prostitutes,

the French may say ‘la chatte’ will

privately love them, we publicly
hate them, Black book girl, blue
eyes, Anglo Saxon apple pies - I cry
for mercy but there ain't none‘ left -
Black Book girl got‘my body and
my breath "

On “Religion” Paris shows that
nothing is sacred. The lyrics
hauntingly stated: “You know I
almost got religion - but the stories
that they told were‘ too unreal -' but
I believe in the healin’ hand and

the power of -one man _- to g_“«"‘-

“Starcage" and. “Beautiful
Youth" loudly and viciously attack
stardom and fame. “Solitaire”

compares England and women to.

"‘cre.epy— crawlies,” “Red Rain"

talks of bloodshed in the streets. Irf’ 

fact all of the remaining cuts on the "

album refer to such pleasant topics
as going crazy, death, the breaking
off of a beautiful love affair, stated
aggressively with sinister heavy
metal.

Paris may be too salty and
overwhelming for most listeners.
It's not an album you groove to,
mellow out to, make love to, or get
happy to. It's an album that will
test your willingness to explore the
cold truth of the world around you.

The lyrics of Robert—Welch are

Jeff Beck once said that “Music

Slumping lcemen To Travel East  

BY STEVE SYBERT
Associate Sports Editor

It's always a shame when a team
does not get a single break because
a slump falls upon it like some
unknown plague. Not getting the
small breaks is bad enough, but
when the big breaks are equally
elusive, a team can be in trouble.

For the Pitt Hockey Club, losers
of its last five out of six games,
such things as the schedule and
location of a game can sometimes
hurt more than “small” matters
like lack of practice.

The Panthers do not have an
easy game left ontheir schedule-
the Washington Chiefs,
Carnegie-Mellon and Westchester
and either Penn’ State or C-MU
again in the Rotary Tournament.

And to complicate matters even
more, the team is facing a long
roadtrip this weekend to take on
the first twoof its remaining foes,
Navy and the Chiefs. Navy will be
tough, as the Panthers found out
last season (a 3-2 loss in Annapolis
and a 6-6 tie here), but the Chiefs,
a Washington area amateur team,
are a mystery. _

“We've got to win these two
games,” said Pitt coach Len
Barcalow. “I'm really looking
forward to the trip. _Our guys are
not as bad as their record indicates
and I'm waiting for them to break
‘out of it."

Last year, Navy posted a 7-3-1
record against collegiate competi-
tion and, according to Midshipman

"Scott Moore, the team captain, is
pushing to gain varsity status at the
National Collegiate Athletic Associ-
ate Division III level.

Unlike the other service academy
hockey teams. the Naval Acade-
my’s faces several problems. First,
Annapolis (and the Washington
D.C. area) is not a hockey town like
West Point, N.Y. and Colorado
Springs, Colorado. If people won’t
go to see the Washington Capitals
of the National Hockey League play
(even with their lowly record), they
aren't going to watch a college
team. ~

Second, although the Navy team
has its own rink on campus, there is
no room for spectators.) Conse-
quently, the team can practice at
home, but must play most of its
games on the road anyhow, (some
“home" games are played at rinks
in the Annapolis area).

So far this season, the Midship-
men are 3-6-1, facing only
collegiate competition. Two wins
came over Drexel (an 18-0 victim of
Pitt's) and New Church Academy
(which fell to the Panthers last
season). Navy’s other victory came
over the Coast Guard Academy.

Navy has two outstanding
players returning from the squad

goalkeeper Bill Hanna lead a

only three seniors and two juniors.
but the team has had its problems.
“We lost our coach two weeks

6 into the season,” Moore said, “and

the Academy had to go looking for
a new one.’ Because of that we
stared out 0-4. We then went 3-2-1
and have been playing good
hockey. We haven’t been beaten
badly by anyone."

The Washington Chiefs are

high schools and colleges in the
District of Columbia. Though they
play college teams, the Chiefs also

Washington is supposed to play
the same caliber of hockey as Navy,
but, like the loose collection of
shinny players they are, probably

Tankers Wrap Up YSU,
Wait For Easterns

BY PATTY TASCARELLA

The men's swimming team
ended the regular season last

a weekend with a 71-42 win over

Youngstown State.

“lt‘was a fun meet; it was
refreshing for all of us,” head
coach Dick Bradshaw said. His
team took 10 of 13 events.

Although Bradshaw’ claimed
Panther performances were “noth-
ing spectacular,” Orlando Catinchi

swam the 100-yard breast stroke in’

1:02 flat.

' “We used the meet to tone up
for the Easterns,"
explaniried.

-The Panthers, 10-1, will cap their
best
illustrious Eastern competition,
where the field will include such
aquatic powers as Maryland, East
Carolina and Syracuse.

"‘We experimented and ran a lot

I of different events against Youngs-
, town," Bradshaw said.

The strangest experiment had to

be the annual “Iron Man Award.”

Bradshaw 2

season since 1937' at the’

The prize can be won only by the
senior captain, who must swim
every event. His times are
compared to those of last year's
captain; if he betters the record, he
wins the award.

Captain (Dave Natali’s perfor-
mance was unique, to say the
least—he was responsible for two
of Pitt’s three losses, both in
relays. The Panthers led the
freestyle relay until Natali dove
into action. Whether he is a true
iron man is still being disputed,
due to differing opinions of the

.judges.

The Pantherettes (10-0) bested
Bucknell and Cornell at a tri-meet
last Saturday, and despite tomor-
row’s contest with Temple, head
coach Kate Mathison, like Brad--
shaw, is preoccupied with the
upcoming Easterns.

Like the Panthers, the women
have a good chance of finishing in
the top four. the Pantherettes,
however, will have the home pool
advantage when they host the
competition; the men travel to
Penn State.

Beware, Eastern Wrestling
League (EWL)—you are about to
be trampled by a dark horse. _

The dark horse is the. Pitt

turn - the results of the_ EWL
tournament into a photo finish.

Today’s and tomorrow’s tourna-
ment is bigger than the Kentucky
Derby, Twenty-seven wrestlers
from the new six-team league will
place and therefore qualify for the
NCAA Championships in Tuscon,
Ariz., March 11-12. -

In Gymnastics

“You can see what they think OI
the caliber of wrestling in our
league,” said head coach Dave
Adams. “Last year, in the Eastern
Intercollegiate Wrestling Associa-
tion, about -27 qualified—and
there were 16 teams in that
league.”

That’s true—the caliber of
wrestling in the EWL is impres-
sive. The Panthers, a powerful
12-4 team- themselves, finished
‘third of the six teams with a 3-2
record, behind seventh-ranked
Penn State and eighth-ranked
Clarion.

The remaining three teams-
Lock Haven, Bloomsburg State and
Buffalo—had winning seasons out-
side of the league and also could
pull ahead down the stretch.

This should make the first EWL
tournament in history extremely

interesting. But Adams and his-

team are conﬁdent they’ll win by at
least a nose. v

We'll make a respectable show-
ing,” he said. “We’ve been
looking forward to this tournament.

havef’ ‘

“I think we can come away witI*.—‘:"~.; _
it," claimed assistant coach George ‘ '

Bryant. “We’ll have a couple
champs—and .probably some good
places.”

Pitt has the talent to come away
with the team title. Bob Bailey, Bill
Bailey, Ray Dallatore, Kevin
Nellis, George O’Korn and Rande
Stottlemyer are pre-tournament
favorites for Pitt (Bill Bailey and
Stottlemyer»haven’t lost a dual-.-
meet match all season), while Don
Arndt, Dave Grau, Bob Kebr,
Craig Phillips, Gregg Soergel and
Milt Schuler could make the
tournament a one-team race.

Co-captains Bob Bailey and
Stottlemyer think the Panthers’
chances are good.

“I think we’re going to do real
well,” Bailey said. “Everyone has
been working hard. This will be our
best showing. We could win it.”

Penn State: Excellence

BY PATTY TASCARELLA

The men's gymnastics team
closed the season in typical fashion
Wednesday night when ‘ the crip-
pled squad fell to undefeated Penn
State, 205.3-143. The Panther-
ettes, despite scoring their highest
point total of the season, also fell to
Penn State, 102.6 to 92.10.

PSU Olympian Gene Whelan
gave the expected excellent perfor-
mance but finished second overall
to teammate Curt Pflieger.
Pflieger, who totalled 51.75 points
to Whelan’s 51.7, was especially
dazzling in his game-high (9.1)
showing in floor exercises.

For Pitt, Don Stevenson had the
highest individual total, highlight-
ed by an 8.85 in vaulting.

“The guys put in a really super

effort,” Panther Coach lg _Perez-

said.

“Tom Daley, Jim Kolesar and
Tony Savelli in particular really
worked hard (the team was coming
off a two week layoff) and it paid
off,” Perez added.

For the 0-6 Panthers—with the
exception of Easterns-bound Ste-
venson-—-a long, hard and very
disappointing season is over.
Record books do not make

allowances for injuries, nor do they
list statistics for effort; if they did,

the figures in Pitt’s won-lost
columns would have to be
reversed.

For the first time all season,
Pantherette coach Donna DeMari-
no had her entire squad back from
injuries and ready to compete; then
all-around Diane Miller sprained
her ankle during warm-ups. I

Despite_the ominous beginning
and the ﬁnal score, the Panther-
ettes gave one of their best
performances of the season.
Cyndee Severyn, back from a
bursitis attack, was not up to her
usual effectiveness but scored 8.0
on the unevens. Not as high,as
usual, but outstanding—Severyn
had been on crutches for a month.

And the gap was filled admirably
by freshman Claire Henry, who
tallied the highest individual count
for Pitt with an 8.35 on the vault
and 30.5 overall, second only to
Penn State's ‘other Olympian,
Karen Schuckman.

DeMarino called Schuckman
“super." That’s an understate-
ment; Schuckman has got to be the
greatest athlete to swing from the
unevens (she scored 9.3 on that
event). Look for her this summer at

Basketball Results

A Wasted Season?

BY TOM HALL
Sports Editor

 

Even though the team has one game left, at St. Francis on March 2,
the Pitt Panther basketball season is virtually over. Some fans contend
the season ended about 15 games ago.

I don’t ﬁnd that an entirely satisfactory appraisal,and a re-examin-
ation-of the hoopsters’ tragic story might change your mind.

I won’t raise the ghosts of Melvin Bennett, Keith Starr and Kelvin
Smith again. Even with those losses, the season well could have been
successful. But then again, who says it wasn’t.

So the Cats went 12-15 this year (hopefully counting on a win in their

g—"(, last contest). This doesn’t make for an unsuccessful season.

The Panthers indeed have played tough, exciting basketball this
year. Everyone who bothered to venture up to the Field House to see
them play can attest to that.

Including their last three wins, the Cats have outscored their
opponents overall and hold a commanding advantage, if you consider
only ﬁeld goals.

Sure, they had the opportunity of beating up on patsies like Penn

,State, Buffalo State and Indiana State. They also had the opportun-
ity to challenge‘ powerhouses like Evansville and Cleveland State,
teams to which they lost because of inequities, injuries, etc._

But I won’t defend them all the time, for sometimes, they just played
dead.

Pitt lost four separate ball games by only one point. That may not be
what one would call successful, but it's bound to be exciting, no matter
for whom you’re pulling.

The Panthers lost a hard-fought basketball game to the Duquesne 4

Dukes, 75-74. That game was, for me, the highlight of the season. It
,had to be the most thrilling basketball played in Pittsburgh in a decade,

__,L.. maybe even two. If you took the opportunity to attend, as only about

‘ -

..'s»'\.

V

- 150 Pitt students did, then you know what I mean.

What about the heart of the Panther competition? That heart also
could be the heart of the top 20 teams in the country!

The Cats faced four top 10 teams this year: "No. 2 Marquette, No. 4
Rutgers, No. 8 Notre Dame and No. 10 Alabama. Despite facing all
-these teams on either neutral or their home courts, the usual height
disadvantage that goes along with playing a winning basketball team,
and injuries that have plagued Tom Richards, Ralph McClelland and
others all season, the Panthers were “blown away” by only one of the
nation’s powerhouses, Rutgers.

All the others could manage only an 11-point victory or less, from a
team that in the preseason was ranked about 200th. For that matter,
both Marquette and Alabama were ﬁghtingfor their lives.

As far as the rivalries go, despite the loss to Duquesne, the Panthers
thrashed Penn State twice and even beat a fairly decent West Virginia
team at the Field House.

Scheduling difﬁculties also hurt this year. Of the 27 games on Pitt’s

7,, U schedule, only 11 were at the Field House.

The Panthers went into the Pennsylvania Basketball Classic a lowly
5-12 team, and most fans expected them to be the doormat for the other
participants.

Well, most fans were wrong, as the Cats proved themselves worthy
by becoming the only team to come up with double victories. And since
that tournament, the Panthers, playing for their own price, went 6-3,
and are likely to make it seven against St. Francis. ,

No, the Cats won’t get a third straight tournament berth. They won’t
end up over .500 this year. But who can say they haven’t tried, and
tried their damndest?

And now for the silver lining.

Suppose you were a high-school all-American. You’d want to play at
a school where they play big-time basketball. But most of all, you’d
want to play. And where do you think the high-school blue-chippers are
looking?

‘ ' Perhaps they’re looking to the schools with the big names and

ya, traditions. Perhaps «they’re looking at a team from Pittsburgh, a team
“'1-—-~"that’s deﬁnitely on the rise. A team that’s headed back toward national

‘ r

prominence. A team with a ﬁrey young head coach Willing to give

everyone a chance to prove himself. A team that. has ﬁve graduating

seniors, (if Starr pursues his pro prospect,) and no ofﬁcial starting

lineup.

There's also a division coming next year called the East Indies, the
regular season champ of which will get an NCAA bid to the 1977
tournament. -

I’d say the Pitt Panthers have had a most successful season. And
their prospects, are, well, limitless!

Motivation is a key problem
for every track. However, the
athletes competing tonight and
tomorrow at the Ohio State Relays
will have added incentive—prizes
—to persuade them to turn in their
best efforts.

The Ohio State Relays, also
known as the Mid-west USTFF
Championships, feature some of
the best collegiate athletes as they
prepare for the NCAAs in two
weeks. i

This meet is solely for the
individual performer. ' No team
score is kept and no team awards
given; only the top three ﬁnishers
in each collegiate event receive
awards, with wristwatches going to
fIrst—place winners.

Karl Farmer, Pitt’s only winner
in 1975, will defend his title in the
600-yard run and also will run in
the mile relay.

The Panthers have three entries
in the distance races and a two-mile
relay team that fmishediin the top
three last year. Mel Boyd and John
Heiser in the two-mile and Nick
Martin in the mile run are strong
contenders.

Sixteen Panthers are scheduled

to travel to Columbus, including six
rookies.

forward Diane Zaken propelled the
offense into scoring and finally into
the 28-20 halftime lead.

Pitt dominated the second half
by putting down easily any attempt
at an Indiana uprising until the
ﬁnal buzzer sounded.

“We didn’t press in the first
half," head coach Pat Wallace
explained. “We've been working
on the zone. As the game went on,
it worked out. We rebounded
better toward the end; at the

beginning we got pushed under.”

Pitt was led by 5-1 I forward Kim
Raymond. In her finest home game
of the season, Raymond had 12

points and 10 rebounds before’

fouling out with 2:45 on the clock.

Zaken was second in scoring with
10 points and Debbie Jones added
nine. Jones was tops in
rebounding with 15 and freshman
center Terry Vogt grabbed 11.
