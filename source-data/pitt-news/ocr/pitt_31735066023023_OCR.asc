PASADENA, Calif—Terry Bradshaw shattered a pair of Super '

' Bowl passing records, throwing touchdown bombs to Lynn Swann and
John Stallworth, as the Pittsburgh Steelers overcame upset-minded
Los Angeles with avcome-from-behind 31-19 victory. in the'National
Football League championship game Sunday.

Pressured into three interceptions by the ﬁred-up Rams, Bradshaw.»

nevertheless stayed cool andfound the seams in the Los Angeles
secondary.
Stallworth ona 73-yarder that produced the winning margin in the
fourth quarter as the Steelers won an unprecedented fourth Super Bowl
crown. ‘ A » ~ .

- Derided as 11-point underdogs, Los Angeles played inspired football
and led 19-17 as the fourth quarter began. What’s more, by then
Bradshaw was operating without Swann, who was knocked out on a

' crushing hit by cornerback Pat Thomas in the third period.

But the veteran Pittsburgh quarterback would not be denied. On the
Steelers’ first possession of the final quarter, he faced a third-and-8 at
his own 27-yard line. ' _ I

Now Vince Ferragamo, the gallant young quarterback of the Rams,

team back. Passes of 24 yards to Preston Dennard and 15 to Billy

Waddy had the Rams on the move at the Pittsburgh 32 as the capacity_

Rose Bowl crowd of 103,985 roared in excitement. 5

But the bubble burst for the youngster, who inherited the startin

Pitt '5 »* Residience Hblli

By BOD WARMKESSEL
Pitt News Staff Writer

' Members'of the Inter-Residence
Board (IRB) fear that ' policies
regarding 24-hour visitation and
overnight guests in Pitt residence
halls may be tightened consider-
ably, although atask force studying
those regulations recently recom-
mended revisions in the present
visitation policy" that are acceptable
to the IRB. — ’ '

IRB members. discussed at a

‘ meeting Wednesday night possible

courses of action to pursue should a
policy more stringent than that
recommended by the task force be
taken. ’
Two members of the task force,
Vukmir,
explained that two proposals
regarding the d0rms___will be‘
presented tomorrow to Dr. Conney

I 7 M. Kimbo, vice chancellor for
. student affairs and organizer of the ‘-

task force. A
One proposal, supported by the
majority of the task force’s voting

. members, would basically “keep

the 24-hour visitation policy as is,

y with the tightening up of desk

security.” said Sofo, adviser to the
IRB. ‘ '
The other proposal, advocated by
Dr. John Vrana, assistant vice
chancellor of business and finance
and a member of the task force,
recommends changes in visitation
and overnight guest privileges for
all students, including “no over-
night guest privileges for fresh-

men."

According to Sofo, Kimbo and
senior vice chancellor for adminis-

R , wt»
I \

tratiop Jack Freeman will ‘review.

both proposals and decide on a
recommendation to be presented to
the university administration for its
consideration. A spokesman in
Kimbo’s office conﬁrmed that both
reports will be reviewed in
formulating a proposal for adminis-
trative action.

“Their (Kimbo’s and Freeman’s)
recommendations may be different
than ours (the task force major-
ity),” said Sofo. He and several
others at the meeting felt that
students should have more input in
the final decision to insure that
student views be taken into
account.

The “majority proposal,” (en-
dorsed by the IRB and most of the
task force members, would allow
students to have overnight, non-
resident guests for no more than 30
days per term, according to Sofo.
A guest could not stay overnight
more than three consecutive days.
In that proposal, an overnight
guest is deﬁned as someone who
signs in at the security desk
between midnight and 7 a.m.

The proposal would also result in

" new sign-in procedures for guests,

Sofo said. In addition to signing in,
a non-resident guest would have to
leave some form of important

identiﬁcation, such as a driver’s.

license, at the security desk. Also,
the time that the guest begins his
visit» would be recorded on the
sign-in sheet so enforcement of the
three-dayrule could be facilitated.

Dr. Vrana’s proposal, in addition
to disallowing 24-hour visitation
and overnight guest privileges,for

.1 :~.,~-.>«. -‘ 11,

. 1

freshman, would restrict upper-
classmen from having 24-hour
visitation and overnight guests on
Sunday’ through Thursday eve-
nings. -On Fridays and Saturdays,
however, upperclassmen would be
allowed to have such privileges. A
student wishing to have_ an
overnight guest would need to have

the permission of his roommate,

according to the proposal.

In Vrana’s proposal, an over-
night guest is deﬁned as “someone
who visits an upperclass student
and stays and/or sleeps overnight
on Friday or Saturday (from 2 a.m.
to the next morning).”

Visitation hours for freshmen
would be noon-2 a.m. seven days a
week if Vrana’s recommendation is
adopted. The proposal advocates

~ housing all freshmen in single-sex

dorms. Vrana proposed these
changes because he thinks “fresh-
men need time to adjust to the
academic and social pressures of
college,” according to ‘Vukmir.

' Attempts to reach Vrana on

— Thursday failed. His office said all

questions regarding the taslé force
should be directed to Kimbo.

Robbie The, Chairman of the;

IRB security council, reported that
petitions supporting" the present
residence hall policies circulated
around campus for two days last
week. As of Wednesday night,
2900 signatures had been collected.

Vukmir added that a recent
survey conducted by the task
force showed that a majority of
students have not been “inconven-
ienced” or “offended” by the
present 24-hour visitation and

were planning a protest rally on the

Cathedral lawn, but he advised

against it. . _

“Individual students protesting

TEST WITH CONFIDENCE

Pittsburgh that's quite a number of
people,” said Michelson.

What makes a phobia different
from a fear is the exaggerated,
intense, and sometimes irrational
quality of the fear itself, said
Mavissakalian. When this fear
reaches the point where it can no
longer be handled by avoiding the
situation and becomes incapacita-
ting to a person’s life, it may need
clinical help, he added.

“When there’s no escape from
the fear and the focus becomes the
anticipation of the panic attacking
any moment, then it becomes a
major problem,”. said Mavissak-
alian.

Through a $200,000 grant from
the National Institute of Mental
Health, both’ Mavissakalian and
Michelson have developed a
three-year clinical program to
study the “complex syndrome” of
anxiety disorders and in particular,

agoraphobia". This speciality clinic
will join the many different
specialty clinics offered at WPIC, a
division of Pitt’s School of
Medicine, said Mavissakalian.

Agoraphobia,_ said Michelson, is
a severe and handicapping phobia
which is essentially a “fear of
fear.”

Mavissakalian explained agora-
phobia is common in women and
starts in young adulthood after
some significant life event, such as
marriage or the loss of at family
member. ’

Thejgoraphobic develops a fear
of going out alone; afraid that they
will panic or lose control and that
they will be punished or embarras-
sed, Mavissakalian said. So the
agoraphobic will only go out with
someone they trust or will go on
what they have determined to be

“safe” routes,’ he added.

To treat agoraphobia, Mavis-
sakalian noted, established be-
havioral and pharmacological me-
thods of treatment are being
studied to determine effectiveness.

The pharmacological treatment
favors medications to help reduce
the frequent and intense panic
attacks, said. Mavissakalian, and
allows the agoraphobic to function
without the fear of such attacks.

The behavioral focus aims
directly at teaching and training

.the individual to not avoid the

fears, he said.

“Sometimes patients are en-
couraged by the lessening panic
attacks and manage to widen their
circle of activity,” said Mavissaka-
lian. “Perhaps we will ﬁnd that a
combination treatment may have
the best effect.” ”

Mavissakalian said that the

eighty individuals treated during P

the research study will be given
active treatment for three months
as outpatients. Their progress will

‘I be followed for a year after this

treatment.

The clinic, although concentrat-
ing its research study on the
agoraphobic, will also be giving
clinical treatment to people with
the many and varied phobias and
anxiety disorders, said Michelson.

“There are different pattemsof,
adjustment for individuals, but

when fear erodes and aggravates a A

life so that it becomes a problem of
living, a person may seek help, ” he
said. ;
“We are -very committed-' to
giving our clinical services, while
examining all‘ our work in’ a

research light. Our aim is to assist .

clinicians in the effective treatment
of these fears,” said Michelson.

No Auditioning Required To Join Pitt's, Choral Ensemble,/7

By DEBBIE MARTIN

" Pitt News Staff Writer
Apathy -has struck yet another
student organization, the Pitt
Choral Ensemble. .
“Up until last year we had about
50 members,” said Eva Turner,
president of the ensemble. “Now
we only have about 25.”
The ensemble, started at Pitt in
/' 1928, gives women a chance to
_, perform together that many co-ed
unversities don’t provide, accord-
ing to Turner.

“Most universities that have a‘

men’s glee club don’t have one for
:‘*women, too, just a mixed choir,”
she said. “The Pitt Choral
Ensemble began in order togive
the same opportunity to women.”
The members, under the direc-
tion of Diane Selvaggio of the.

They have sung at the Lantern
Night sponsored by the Pan-Hel-

lenic Association and Children’s
Hospital and have been invited to
sing at the Jewish Community
Center. Last Thursday, the group
held an open house in the lower
lounge of the Student Union.
Several smaller groups within the
ensemble sang duets, folk songs,

Turner stated. “We want to show

Though the ensemble’s reper-

Resident Assistant Applications Still Acceptable

By MICHAEL ALLEN
, Pill News Staff Writer

Although applications for Res-
ident Assistant positions irr Pitt’s
dorms were due January 17, late
applications -are still being accept-‘
ed, according to JoAnn Woodson
director of the Ofﬁce of Residence
Life.

The candidates for the positions
must be full-time students with,a

quality point average of at least 2.5 .

and must have junior. senior, or

graduate academic standing,
Woodson said. In addition to ﬁling
applications, RA candidates must
also submit transcripts and re-
commendations. '

The duties of an RA are varied,
ranging from instituting discip-

linary action to assisting students-

with personal or school problems,

said Woodson. .
“We want a person who is

active, a person who derives

satisfaction by helping others,’<‘_

Woodson said. ,_

RAs must be ﬂexible in order to
deal with the 30 or so students
living in their areas, she added.

“The nature of our business

/‘always has a few surprises,” she

said. “We want a person who can
wear a number of different hats.”

Adding to the .complications of
the job is that an RA is not a
controller of students in his/her.
area but an adviser, Woodson
added.

The selection process will be

based on the applications, tran-'

scripts, recommendations and per-
sonal group meetings to be held in
the next few" weeks. Applicants
who are chosen to be RAs will be
notified Feb. 28, according to
Woodson. ’

The new RAs will begin to train‘

for their new positions at an all-day
workshop at the end of winter ferrn.
They will also attend a week-long

training workshop the week before
the start of_the next fall term,

Woodson said.

The annual budget process, the headline gathering,

yearly extravaganza conducted by the Student.

Government Board and its Allocations Committee,
‘is about to begin.

Each student organization must prepare and

‘ ,submit its budget to the Allocations Committee and

-. then on to the board for its_approval, based on

predetermined guidelines. These guidelines are
designed to reduce the complications inherent" in
preparing and later, to approve the organizations’

' , budgets. .

At a recent meeting of the Student Government
Board, a list of recommended priorities and
additional stipulations to the Allocation’s policies
and procedures were presented by Allocations
‘ Committee chairperson Kerry L. Warren. The list
of priorities, including stipulations concerning
programming and office supplies, were approved by
the board. ‘ 
The board did not approve one of the new
stipulations under policies and procedures which

 place financial limits on what a studentworganization

could request in its budget.

Under the proposed limits, the SGB and its
standing committees may request a total. package of
$55,000, the governance groups may request up to
$12,500 each‘, and the general groups mayrequest up
to $2,500 each (with the exception of the Owl

yearbook, .WPGH Radio, Pitt Hockey, and-

Backspace). '

Instead of taking a hard line (and realistic)
approach to the financial limits, the board watered
them down by changing the limits from mandatory to
recommendations. '

We strongly disagree with the Board’s move.

The financial limits were carefully calculated to
reflect available funds plus previous allocations to
the various organizations.

Setting. the limits would have taught the"

organizations’ leaders a valuable lesson. That is, the
leaders would have been forced to work‘ within a
budget, carefully weighing each item requested as to
its need and priority in the functions of the
organization. _ . .

Instead, with the limits now merely a
recommendation, the groups will likely continue
padding-their budgets, hoping that at least some of
their requests will be approved. The illogicality of
such a practice is obvious.“

@112 iﬂitt Nexus

Page 6——Monday, January 21, 1980

For example, a governance group may turn in a
$25,000 budget request, filled with inexpensive, low‘
quality programs. Assuming that the governance
groups will receive the same amount of funds as in
the past, the individual governance group could
expect $5,000 to $10,000 in funding. Because the
Allocations Committee and SGB could not afford to
approve the total $25,000 request, many items in the
budget would be cut, leaving the governance group
with a weak list of programming. -

If mandatory limits would have been imposed, in
this case a maximum request of $12,500, the

governance group would have been forced to?“

design high quality programming, to get the most for
their money. ‘

Failure to set limits on budgetary requests force
Student Government to undertake the tedious job of
wading through massive budgets. The job not only
will be difficult; it will be next to impossible. Instead
of virtually guaranteeing Pitt students fine, quality
programming by setting the limits, students will face
the same dull, irrelevant programs they have faced in
the past. A ' ’

We hope that student leaders see the need for
following the financial limits, even though it is not
mandatory, for the benefit of" their own
organizations and the student body.

The Tragedy Of The‘ Lang|eyHa|| Explosion Rememberedéh

’ known as Tests Unlimited.

By SUE McFARLAND

Jan. 20, 1977....12:4O p.m....

_ Sections of the east coast were’
virtually paralyzed amid the
nations most severe winter energy
crisis. Governor Milton Shapp
ordered all Commonwealth public
and private schools closed for an
indefinite period of time to
conserve the state’s dwindling
heating fuel supplies

A biting wind, forcing sub zero 2

temperatures, swept across the Pitt
campus where it remained “busi-
ness as usual” despite the crisis
situation.

Crowds of students and faculty
scurried across the congested,
snow-covered city streets on route
to their 1 p.m. classes.

Suddenly, all activity came to a
grinding halt—trafﬁc on Fifth Ave.
stopped, as

did a group of

businessmen entering the Univer-
sity Club for lunch and students
making the treacherous hike up the
hill tothe chemistry building.

It was on this day at this time
that the history of the University of
Pittsburgh was irreparably marred
by tragedy, when a rumbling blast
ripped through and leveled the
Langley Hall Annex, killing two
persons and injuring countless
others.  ~

-Yesterday marked the third .. Only minutes transpired that day /

screeching from every direction to

worst.

 Third Anniversary or Langley Blast TimleFor Reflection

(Continued from page 6)
broadcasted inauguration of .a
Georgia farmer as the nation’s 39th
President, reported as many as 200
persons trapped within the twisted
steel, and crumbled concrete
conﬁnes of what once housed
several lecture halls, laboratories
and faculty offices. A

Crowds of silent onlookers
quickly gathered alongside the

‘ wreckage as ﬁremen, paramedics
and volunteers_ from a local
o'}‘nstruction site sifted through the
rubble in search of victims—a
search_many feared might yield the
body of an unaccounted for
roommate, boyfriend, or as in my
case, a friend from home.

Off to the side of the crowd a
middle-aged man clad in a dark suit
ﬁnished an interview with a local
television reporter. As heﬁnished
the interview, he, stared at‘ the
wreckage, his face displaying the

horror that was so prevalent that
day. This man was Wesley Posvar,
Chancellor of the university.
Posvar stood alongside the stu-
dents that day, sharing their grief,
questoning why fate had chosen to
play such dirty gameswith their
young lives, lives that had only just

« begun.

Back in the dorms, groups of
students huddled around small
television sets, awaiting word on
the situation. These were the same

students who just weeks before '

joyously celebrated the victory of
their number one football team in
the._Sugar Bowl. Thoughts of New
Orleans’ Bourbon Street and the
Superdome were nowhere to be
found. There was no cheering and
no laughing anywhere on campus.

These students, members of
what’ critics termed the ““me
generation” answered pleas for

donors from the Central Blood

Bank of Pittsburgh in such great
numbers that many had-to be
turned away. They sought to
disprove the stereotypic tag attach-
ed to their generation, wanting

‘desperately to give of themselves

so that classmates they did not
even know might live. On ‘a
campus of 30,000 strangers there
was a sense of cohesiveness, each

"one giving for the other.

The investigations into the blast
that claimed the lives of a young
girl who wanted to be a teacher and
a university secretary have been
closed, with a natural gas leak
beneath the streets of Oakland
being listed as the cause. For the
most part, the physical wounds
have healed, but, ,for those who
experienced the sights and sounds
of Jar_1.‘20, 1977, and for those who
lost ‘friends and family, the
memories of that day will be

"inothing to say.

indelibly etched in their minds to
be relived again’and again.

Sitting here at my typewriter I
ﬁnd myself in the rather precarious
position of being a writer with
There is no
editorial comment to be made when
speaking of - the Langley Hall
explosion. I can say that the ordeal
of living through such a tragedy
was one of the great growing
experiences of my years at Pitt.

I might feel compelled to convey
to our readers some Divine
journalistic message, urging all to
live each day to the fullest, “to turn

the other cheek” and to appreciate‘

friends and family while fate
permits them to be in our presence.
But I won't deliver preachings that
I, myself, do not abide by.
Although my idealistic side
would like to adhere to‘ these
preachings, I continue to complain
about the course of my life, am

,/

intolerant of the shortcomings of

others, and partake in the “people ~

games” we are guilty of playing
from time to time.

I will instead conclude, leaving
this column as it was originally

intended...a remembrance of that -

tragic day three years ago, a tribute
to those who lost their lives and a
reminder~to those of us who were

spared.

Pitt's’ Swimmin’ Women tra-
veled to Lion Country for what
proved to..be their best swimming
and diving of the season, only to
lose to Penn State by one point
66-65.

“Penn State is our biggest
rivalry. Everyone is doing much
better, coinpared to our past
performances, especially Amy
Jackson, who won three events;
Nancy Henry, who won two and
Bonnie Durdy, who won two,” said
coach Dick Bradshaw.

“If we had done our lineup
d_iffere‘ntly,in two events by
switching our relay teams, I believe
we would have won the meet,”
added Bradshaw. “But, as, it
turned outfwe just didn’t have
enough depth to face the bigger
Penn State team. We won nine out

_of the 15 events, which shows we'll

be stronger when we face them
again at Penn State for Easterns.”
Jackson won the 200-yard
freestyle with a time of 1:59, which
is slow for her; however, she had
just finished a relay event right
before the 200. Judy Klotz was
second with a time of 1259.6.
Jackson also won the 100-free
with a time of 52.8 and the 50 free
in 24.4. She is now qualiﬁed to
swim in both events at nationals,

, the biggest meet of the year.

Bonnie Durdy won the 1,650-
yard freestyle (one mile) in 17:27.4,
and Judy Klotz was second.

“Judy is beginning to come
around, and I feel she’s getting
stronger all the time,” Bradshaw
said. “She did her best times this

‘ meet.”

extended the Panthers’ consecutive
win streak to 28 meets.

The divers were led by Pat
Greenwell, a - junior from Florida,

Lambert, a sophomore from Wex-
ford, Pa., also. did well in .the
one-meter event.

The swimmers were led by Rick
Carter, Scott Winkler and Stu

in both the 50- and 100.-yard free-
style events. Scott Winkler
‘ excelled in his victory in"the

Although the margin of victory

 Lehigh ‘Engineers’ 47-4
Trouncing of Pitt Grapplers

:1 By ANNA ARLOTTA
Pitt News Staff Writer

The awesome engineers of
Lehigh showed no mercy on the
Panther grapplers Saturday as they
decisively defeated Pitt 47-4.

Lehigh added Pitt to its list of
victims this season as the team
strives for a national team title.

r.';‘3resently, Lehigh is ranked No. 2
in the country. _ .

The poised Lehigh grapplers, led
by. returning national champion
Darryl Burley and NCAA runner-
up Mike Brown were strong from
top to bottom. Only heavyweight
Drew Keiser fell to defeat at the
hands of Panther Steve “Smokey”
Smocharski in a 10-2 decision.

Rick Santoro opened things up
for Lehigh with a pin ov'er_ Greg
Yurich with only 38 seconds gone
in the match. Yurich was filling in
for the injured Glen Maxwell, an
Eastern champ of a year ago who is
hampered by anaggin-g elbow.

At 126 pounds Panther Billy
Clark, who has looked tough in his
matches all season, lost a hard-
fought battle to Steve Bastianelli
3-2. Pete Schuyler put Lehigh up
by a 13-0 score as he took an 11-2
decision over Glenn Nacion.

The 'Panthers defaulted in the
142-pound class when Jeff Gordon
discontinued his bout due to injury.

Gordon was facing defending ‘

national champ Darryl Burley and‘
was losing 17-5 when he chose to
stop.

Another quick pin was recorded
in the 150-pound class as defending

high school state champion Tom

Bold pinned the Panthers’ Mike
Toole with only 1:08 gone in the
match. The team score stood at
25-0.

Still another freshman was left in

‘the star-studded lineup in the

person of Jim Reilly. Reilly, who
reigns from the Philadelphia area,
was named a national prep school
champion last season. He also took
most outstanding wrestler at the
prep school tournament. Facing
the Panthers’ Eric Harris, Reilly
came away with a 10-3 decision and
continued the Lehigh shutout.

The second default of the night
for Pitt took place in the 167-pound
class when the Panthers’ John
Chendy was leading Roy Lobdell by
a 9-5 score with 1:09 remaining in
the second period. Due to an injury
to Chendy’s shoulder, the match
was stopped. He did return for a
short time but decided not to
continue. This match had been one
of the few chances for a Pitt victory.

Lehigh recorded two more pins

in the following weight classes.

First, the Engineers’ Kevin Kilrain

pinned Jeff Wilps in 4:49 of their
match. Kilrain is currently ranked
No. 5 in the nation by “Amateur
Wrestling News.’i’ Then, NCAA
runner-up of a year ago Mick
Brown pinned Pat Connor in 5:50 of
their match. 4 Brown was only up by
a 4-1 score at the time of the fall.

In the heavyweight class, Smo--I

charski was able to salvage a
Panther. victory, 10-2,- over‘ Keiser.

Although the Panthers were losing-

by a 47-0 score, he still brought the
Pitt fans to their feet.

Head coach Rande Stottlemeyer
was far from pleased with his
team’s performance against the
highly talented Engineers. I

“What can I say,” said
Stottlemeyer. “They kicked our
butts. I certainly wasn’t very
pleased.”

Pitt’s next match is at home
against Ohio State on Wednesday
at 7:30 p.m.

osu Tough Opener i

By STEVE THOMAS

The Pantherette track team journeyed to Columbus, Ohio
this past weekend to open the 1980 season with the Ohio State
Invitational. The results weren’t what the coaches and team
members had hoped for, but it wasn’t a total loss, according
to head coach Alfreeda Goff. ‘ "

The Pantherettes placed ninth out of 13 entries as two
women, Peri Jude Radecic and Margie Lee, looked
impressive .in their respective events. Radecic, who qualified
individually for last year’s Association of Intercollegiate
Athletics for Women’s (AIAW) outdoor championships,
hurled theshot put 44 feet 9 1/2 inches, good for third place
in the meet. Lee set a new Pitt indoor record for the 3000-
meter run with a time of 10:47. -

Despite Lee’s accomplishment, Radecic was the only

who last year won the 200-meter dash in the Buckeye State

off stride, denying her a place in the finals.

“Had Gwen not been bumped, she probably would have »
placed for the finals,” Goff said. A

There are only two seniors on the Pitt team, and Goff
hoped that the freshmen and sophomores realized their help
was needed if the team is to have a successful year.

Michigan State won the meet, while Indiana—also of the
Big.Ten—placed second. The host Buckeyes finished third.
No records were set, but Coach Goff was impressed with the
overall talent entered in the competition.

The Pantherettes entered only seven of 12 events.

_ Goff indicated she isn’t ready to press the panic button.
This was only the first meet.of the season, she said, and with
such a young team, things really weren’t so bad.

Next week, the young Pantherettes hope to fare better as
they travel to East Lansing, Mich. for the Michigan State

The men’s track team was idle over the weekend, except for
two relay teams. Darren Gearey, Terry Gallagher, Joel
Albers and Greg Conover were participants in the college
division of the Philadelphia Track Classic’s two-mile relay
event and placed second behind Villanova. I

The mile relay of Dee Baines, Larry Shippen, Duane
DeFoor and Bud Cooper also competed but did not place.
Pitt hosts its annual indoor invitational this weekend. A

PASADENA, Calif.——Venerable
Art Rooney could not" gloat over
Pittsburgh’s fourth Super Bowl
victory Sunday—he had too much
sympathy in his 78-year-old heart
for the losers.

“I know how they felt, because I
went so many years myself in
frustration,” the white-haired
chairman of the board_said after his
Steelers had beaten the Los
Angeles Rams 31-19 in the Rose
Bowl.

By The Associated Press

PASADENA, Calif. (AP)—Having
two Super Bowl tickets in his
pocket wasn’t enough to keep a 0
man warm during the pre-dawn
chill at the Rose Bowl Sunday, and
he was .arrested for setting ﬁre to
some police barricades.

“He may be bailed out, but if he
doesn't, those tickets stay in jail
with him.” ' said Sgt. . Bruce
Linsenmayer. As the night
temperature dropped close to 40
degrees, the man put some

Rooney, who will be 79 in six days.
“They should be proud. Just as’ I
am proud of my boys. These are
the most gentlemanly fellows I
have ever had. None of them ever
gets fat-headed.”

The colorful Rooney, who pur-
chased the Pittsburgh franchise in
1933 for $12,000 which friends say
he won at a racetrack, went 41
years before he saw his team win a
National Football League champi-

"man said. The man, whose identity
was withheld, was held for
investigation of “unlawful burning
of the property of another”——a
felony.

Tickets for the National Football
League championship game Sun-
day cost $30 each, but ticket agency
spokesmen in Los Angeles were
asking at least $75 per seat and
about $200 each for seats near

ium.

The Steelers won their first title
in 1974, repeated in1975 and came
back to win again last year.

Rooney, son of a Pittsburgh

saloon-keeper, lives in a house he,

has occupied for 40 years. He was
designated to toss the opening coin
before Si_1nday’s game.

“I don’t know why they
selected me,” he said, almost
apologetically. “It was all -right

when George Halas did it last year.
But it was a surprise when they
picked me.”

He was driven into the stadium
in an open antique automobile
and taken off in a golf cart after
swapping pleasantries with Georg-
ia Rosenbloom, owner and presi-
dent of the Rams since the death
last year of her husband, Carroll.

The unpretentious Steeler own-
er, who wears thick glasses, puffed
constantly on a _cigar but" moved
crisply from the ﬁeld to his position
on the roof of the Rose Bowl
stadium.

“That referee kept" my coin,” he
said, appearing to be a little ill at
ease. “I have asked Jack Hand, an.
assistant to NFL Commissioner

Pete Rozelle, to get it back for
me.”

‘Halas used a $20 gold piece last
year, but Rooney was equipped
with a large commemorative medal
inscribed Super Bowl VI. The
minting has not caught up with the
times.

Lady Lions

(Continued from page 8)

Durdy also won the 400
individual medley in 4:39.8. Klotz
was second. Henry won the
200-yard butterﬂy with the time of
2:0”/4'.5 and the 100 ﬂy in 59.2.
Sandy Taylor was second in the 100
fly withthe time of one minute ﬂat.
Henry was second in the 200-yard
backstroke with a time of 2:15.

The women divers came through
as always, -according to ﬁrst-"year
coach Julian Krug.

“We were a little worried about
Penn State’s divers because they

are always consistent, but our girls
are proving to be reliable" every
meet,” said Krug.

Hillary McBride won the one-

Rooney has delegated direction‘
of the club to his sons, Dan and Art‘

Jr., and personally does not

interfere with operations.

“I never go into the locker room
ifl can help it,” he said. “That’s
for the players and coaches.”

Splash Pitt

meter competition and Holly Sluss

was third. Julie De Haven, a,
freshman, won the three-meter
board. ,

“Right now we are just

working at improving our_time§f.-
remaining strong, keeping with our

weight program and working hard
at practice,” said Bradshaw. “We
work all year for the two big
meets--easterns and nationals--

wh.ere all the‘ hard work and
devotion of these women. . .has
always paid offat the end of the
season.”

TANKER’S NOTE: Linda
Frankenbach and Cindy ‘Ferraro
were both out with injuries and did
not compete at Penn State.
