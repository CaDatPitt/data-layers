Leonard Barnum, promising fresh-
man athlete at the University last
year, has evidently decided to quit
here to enroll as a student-at West
,V1'rginia Wesleyan. . * n

University authorities could offer no
‘reason for the withdrawal of the for-
mer all-West Virginia scholastic foot-
ball star other than he was dissatis-
ﬁed .with ‘conditions here. Barnum,
had attended summer school at the?‘

to enter the tall sports schedule as a.
memberof the freshman eleven. He
had taken part in-' spring football
drills last semester with the varsity.

man‘. ‘, * , ..
Barnum entered the University

with ‘the mid-semester class last win-
ter and participated only-in freshman
itra‘ck., He proved a sensation, gain-
ingrecognition as a real one-man
track team when he competed in the
shot put, discus, hammer and avelin-

and -both hurdles onthe cinders.
According . to newspaper reports
from‘ Parkersburg, West Virginia, the
200—pound fullback from Parkersburg
High School made an unsuccessf.u1-at-
tempt to enter West -Vir‘ginia;Univer.-
sitylat, Morgantown. He failed due to_
an agreement between ‘the Panthers
and Mountaineers barring -any trans-
fer ;Ji_athletés for one year from ath-.
letic sports. ' He_ then turned to Buck-__
hannon and is said to have registered
at West Virginia Wesleyan there. He
was-not with the ‘Bobcat football team-
”when it was here Friday night to play

-Regardlessvof what else Hank Day
brings up from littl‘e Washington for
Saturday's game with the, Panthers,
it's a cinch’ that he will have eleven
;players who know the fundamentals
‘of the game. The ‘Wash’-Jeff coach is
one of those fellows who insists that
his players be masters of the fine arts
qt blocking and tackling. However,
