Students volunteer for politicians

By Jim Rowe
For The Pitt News

For many of Pitt’s College
Republicans and University
Democrats, their free time in
the fall is spent volunteering
for local politicians.

And while the elections
are still several weeks away,
the groups are now organiz-

teer arsenals, meeting with

‘their candidates and having

a little fun on the side — all
while gaining experience in
the tricky world of politics.
Typically, the college vol-
unteers will help out by
knocking on doors, stuffing
envelopes and working the
polls on election day —
mostly grunt work. But vol-

include internship opportu-
nities and invitations to
high—profile events.

An afternoon of door
knocking consists of can-
vassing a neighborhood,
handing out pamphlets and
answering questions about
their candidate.

“Door knocking is typical-
ly a weekend activity,” said

Some Pitt pro-lifers are ﬁred up about a
proposal that may soon require residents to
participate in ab.ortion training in order to
complete their medical education. .

The Accreditation Council for Graduate
Medical Education, which sets the guide-
lines for residency programs, is making an
attempt to enact regulations that will require
residents to be trained in performing abor-
tions or be allowed to train in another pro-
gram, according to Dzintra Brugman of Life
Dynamics, Inc., in Denton, Texas.

“Life Dynamics is a pro-life education
organization and litigation support service
that sues on behalf of women who have
been killed or sexually assaulted while hav-
ing an abortion,” president Mark Crutcher
said.

“The biggest problem the American abor-
tion industry is having is that they can't get
anyone to do abortions,” Crutcher said.

Life Dynamics attempts to educate stu-
dents about their rights and about the fact
that they cannot be forced to perform abor-
tions, according to Crutcher.

“There is a falling number of abortion-

trained doctors coming out of medical
school,” Brugman said.

Crutcher said he is concerned that med-
ical students may not be aware of their
rights and may believe that they have to per-
form abortions if instructed.

The process that students learn is a gener-
al part of obstetrics and gynecology training
because it is performed on women who
have miscarried, Crutcher said. “We don’t
have a problem with them knowing [the
process],” he said. Crutcher said his prob-
lem lies with elective abortions, the per-
forming of this process on “a perfectly
healthy woman and a perfectly healthy
child.”

V “They try to cloak it by telling [residents]
they have to learn the procedure. It’s a mind
game,” he said.

Crutcher said that educators put up a
“smoke screen” so they can mentally pre-
pare students to perform elective abortions.

Chris Kahlenbom, an internist at St.
Margaret's Hospital in Aspinwall, said that
the ACGME guidelines, if enacted, would
go into effect in 1996. He said he believes
interest groups have put pressure on the
ACGME because of the lack of doctors who
are willing to perform abortions.

§Politicians, page 3

 
  

Republican candidates, members of
the Pitt College Republicans were
recently invited to attend a rally for
county commissioner candidates
Larry Dunn and Bob Cranmer at
the Rosebud Cafe in the Strip
District.

For CR members Jeanne
Santosusso and Nadine Narducci, it
was an offer too good to refuse.

“We wanted to give some sup-
port for the Republican candidates,
and we got in free for working on
their campaigns,” said Santosusso.

“We’ve been to speeches, but this
is the first rally that we’ve been to,”
she said, as the pair rubbed shoul-
ders with some of the most recog-
nizable figures in Allegheny
County politics. »

The two watched attentively as
Larry Dunn and Bob Cranmer min-
gled through the crowd of about 60.
Congressional candidate Bill
Ravotti was also on hand, thanking

A tho'se'w'ho have helped him so far.

Santosusso and Narducci have
both volunteered this election for
Republican Campaigns by stuffing
envelopes and plan to go door to
door for Ravotti.

“Some people call it grunt work,
but it's more like getting the word
out, like advertising,” Santosusso
said.

Narducci agreed but was hesitant

Doctors in training mightlearn abortions

“Nobody really wants to do it,” he said.
“But they’re willing to do it for the money.”

Kahlenbom said that most residency pro-
grams would not have to heed the ACGME
guidelines, but if the guidelines were
ignored, the program could lose accredita-
tion and federal funds as a result. He said
there is government legislation being drawn
up to outlaw the proposed guidelines.

A spokesperson from Magee Women's
Hospital said that it is not required that resi-
dents at Pittsburgh medical school partici-
pate in abortion training, but it is available if
they are interested.

“It’s so ironic that people are always hol-
lering about choice,” Crutcher said. “If they
can't get anyone to [perform abortions],
then they try to force them.”

Kahlenbom said he believes that, as a
doctor, performing abortions goes against
the principles of medicine. He said abortion
counters the hippocratic oath that doctors
once took. He said that this oath stated. “I
will administer no abortive remedy."

“Recently, in the last two decades. that
has changed because of the legalization of
abortion.” Kahlenbom said. ‘‘It just shows
how far we’ve deteriorated and the true
nature of what people really believe."

JULIE CROWELL: The majority of
Crowell's activites for September
focused around lobbying issues and
events. On September 11, Vice President
Al Gore addressed approximately 8,000
Pittsburgh Area Students at a rally to

Save Student Aid. Proud to host the
‘Rally and host students from CMU,

. Point Park, Chatham, Carlow,

Duquesne, CCAC, WVU, PSU and
Temple. Crowell thanks Keith Campbell,
the Student Government Board and
office staff, the Office of Student and
Public Affairs, the Office of Student
Activities, Facilities Management,
University Graphics, the Department of
Public Safety and the Office of the
Chancellor. The SGB's from Pitt, CMU,
and Duquesne attended a Rally at
Temple University on September 30,
1995. Wish to commend Temple on an
effective lobbying attempt.

On Tuesday October 10, a meeting of the
Escort Service Advisory Board was held.
Julie Crowell, Patrick Huey, Abigail
Schlesinger, Joyce Giangarlo and Joe
Cavalla of Office of Student Activities,
Robert I-Iarkins and John Morgan of the
Department of Parking and
Transportation, and Dr. Donham of the
Office of Student and Public Affairs
attended to discuss to scope, budget,
location, staffing, and future of the
Student Run Escort Service. Crowell
thanks Huey and Schlesinger for their
hard work on this project. Crowell
appointed five non-CGS undergraduates
to the College of Arts and Sciences
Council, five students to the Academic
Integrity Hearing Board, and one under-
graduate to the Study Abroad
Scholarship Committee. All appointees
will be notified by mail by Carol Lynch
of the CAS Deans Office. On October 11,
Crowell attended the Policy Forum on
Generational Politics and the Future of
Social Security co-sponsored by GSPIA
and the National Academy on Social
Insurance. Crowell congratulates Hans
Reimer from the University of California
at Santa Cruz on an interesting program
and would like to thank the
Governmental Relations Committee for
their hospitality while Hans was a guest
in our office. On October 12, Crowell
met with Rick Easterling of University
Resource Services to preview a program

that would provide publicity and folders
to the Student Government Board. On
October 13, Crowell attended the
Institute of Politics Student Affairs
Committee meeting. The SGB was com-
mended for co-sponsoring the Forum on
Financial Aid, the Legislator for a Day
Program and other political activities
that we have participated in throughout
the year. These programs were intro-
duced for the first time this year; we
hope to improve upon these example to
create more interaction between stu-
dents, faculty, and elected officials. On
October 16, Crowell attended the Kevin
Cecil Benefit Committee meeting. We
are pleased to announce that $560.95
was collected at Midnight Madness and
$1000.00 was donated by the
Engineering Student Council from indi-
vidual Engineering Departments.
Future fund-raisers include a recycling
drive and Ice Skating at Schenley Ice
Rink. JANE BERGER: Berger has spent
the majority of her time this semester on
the Pittsburgh Project. The Pittsburgh
Project, coordinated by Berger, was the
first Student Government Board attempt
at a University wide community service
event aimed to ”help redd this place up
n’atl" (clean this place...) The event,
which took place on October 7, was
extremely successful, with almost 600
students participating, and a few staff
and faculty members. Berger wishes to
thank Larry Bartlebaugh, the Student
Volunteer Outreach Coordinator for the
Center for Public and community
Service, whose hard work helped make
the event the success it was. The SGB
Community Relations Committee was
the prime mover of the project, and
deserves high praise as well. Berger
speciﬁcally thanks Kristin Johnson and
Bethany Wasel of the SGB CRC for their
dedication. The Interim Chancellor, Dr.
Marc Nordenberg, and the Vice
Chancellor of Student and Public
Affairs, Dr. Leon Haley addressed the
volunteers at the morning assembly to
express their excitement at the enthusi-
astic response to social action.- Berger
thanks them, not only for their atten-
dance and participation in the project,
but for their support of the project.
Berger has also been working with
Campbell in his quest to ”Save Student
Aid,” and will be working with the
Governmental Relations Committee to
promote voter registration and political
activism. If anyone has any comments
or suggestions for next year's Pittsburgh
Project, please contact Berger at the SGB
office.

KEITH CAMPBELL: Worked through
the summer with the White House to
schedule Vice President Gore for the

Save Student Aid Rally on September 11.

funding. On October 26, Campbell led a
delegation of students to Washington,
D.C. to lobby against $10.8 billion in cuts
to student loans and $4.2 in reduced stu-
dent aid appropriations as part of a
national student day of action. On
October 8, Campbell's proposal to form
an ad—hoc food services committee in
conjunction with the Resident Student
Association (RSA) was approved. The
committee will work with the Food
Services Department on issues of cost,
service, convenience, and food quality.
On October 13-15, Campbell attended
the conference to form NASHE
(National Association of Students for
Higher Education), a new student orga-
nization focused completely on financial
aid advocacy. Worked on a proposal to

interviews for the 1996 Freshman
Council and Governmental Relations
Chairperson. Callahan attended the
Pittsburgh Project and also facilitated an
emergency Presidents Council Meeting.
Callahan has been working with Keith
Campbell on the Save Student Aid coali-
tion.

JOHN A CAPRIOTTI: Has spent much
of his time radically revising the paper
campaign section of the new and
improved elections code. The changes
made to the code should limit the cost of
campaigning and reduce the potential
for ”campaign scandal." As a member
of the Constitutional Review Committee,
worked extensively with Allocations
Committee Chairperson Brian
Kavalukas on amending the allocations
section of the Student Government
Board Constitution. The revisions allow
for twelve (from eight) allocations com-

~ mittee members, and eliminates alter-

nates. I, with board members Callahan
and Campbell, began the organization of
this year's Freshman Council. Capriotti
has been appointed to the Sexual Assault
Services Working Committee.

JULIE CLOUSE; Clouse worked with
and is continuing to work with students
and administrators concerning recycling.
Students from SEAC, RSA and other stu-
dent groups have formed a Recycling
Club. Thus far, the club met with
Facilities Management to discuss their
progress with recycling on campus. An
increase ofbins, a betterment of the loca-
tion of bins and an improvement of
labeling are all areas where Pitt students
will see an improvement. Clouse has
also met with Housing Support Services.
In the dorms, there are bins for recy-
cling. According to Gil Sheaffer, it is left
to the students to use the bins properly.
The recycling club is working on ways to
educate students who live in the dorms.
Right now, a pilot program was initiated
in McCormick hall. Volunteer students
collect recyclables weekly and a local
company hauls the paper, aluminum
and plastic away. So far, the program
has been a success and we hope to
expand to other dorms in the Quad".
Clouse met with the manager from Copy
Cat. Copy Cat does have recycled paper
that can be ordered for the students.
Copy Cat will also label their recycling
bins. Clouse also attended the Student
Aid rally at Temple University. She
hopes that with all of the student sup-
port that was exhibited the legisltature
will reconsider their cuts on student aid.
Clouse worked with Chris Nestor,
Elections Chairman, to interview and

select the new Elections Committee. We
also made changes to the elections code.
We hope that this year the election will
be run as fairly and efficiently as possi-
ble.

PATRICK HUEY: Throughout the
months of September and October Huey
continued work to set up a trial period
of the Student Escort Service. In early
October, such a project was approved
with a preliminary budget of $25,000.
The project is currently taking applica-
tions for a student director and will
begin service sometime in January.
Huey also attended the departmental
meeting of Parking and Transportation
on October 17, where Phase IH lighting
improvements were discussed as was
the 1996 fiscal year budget for the
department. Anyone wishing to see spe-
cific information about any of these top-
ics is encouraged to call or stop by the
SGB office.

CREIGHTON MOOREHEAD: This
past month Moorehead has been work-
ing with University Administrators and
student groups discussing a new WPU
policy involving the payment for securi-
ty at open dances held in the WPU.
Starting November 1, there will be a ﬂat
fee for security; this allows organizations
to keep their social events on campus in
a safe, non-alcoholic environment.
Moorehead also attended the meeting of
the Diversity Task Force. He has been
woking with the Multicultural commit-
tee of SGB and is helping them put
together their Fall newsletter the MOSA-
IC . Moorehead was also a part of the
selection committee for the non-CGS
undergrad to sit on the Chancellor
Search Committtee. Moorehead worked
on the Save Student Aid Rally and The
Pittsburgh Project.

PAUL J. UFBERG: Throughout this
semester, Ufberg has been working with
Christine Vaflor, the Academic Affairs
Chairperson, on the Student Course
Evaluation Guide. Ufberg met with Dr.
Jack Daniel to discuss the project and
possible future plans. Ufberg also has
completed his work with the Design
Registration Team; a final report has
been compiled and submitted to the
University. Ufberg served on the
Governmental Relations Search
Committee as well as the Freshman
Council Search Committee. Ufberg took
part in the ”Save Student Aid Rally" as
well as The Pittsburgh Project. John
Callahan, Julie Crowell, and Ufberg
helped in the planning and placement of
the ”UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH"
banners currently lining both Fifth Ave.

9 Abortion training

As early as two years from now. all medical students who
want to complete their residencies may have to be trained in per-
forming an abortion. If the Accreditation Council for Graduate
Medical Education has its way, every resident medical student
will be required to be trained in abortions.

‘ The proposed requirement has raised a lot of controversy

between pro-life organizations and the medical community. Pro-

lifers argue that this is a coercive tactic to make up for the
. shrinking number of people who willingly learn to perform

abortions. But the medical community argues that this is a pro-
’ cedure which may be required to save lives in certain situations,

and we believe that they are right. Even the majority of the pro-

lifemovement does not dispute the necessity of abortions in
1 cases which would threaten the mother’s life.

All doctors take the Hippocratic oath when they are certified
to practice medicine. That oath requires doctors to do everything
in their power to save the lives of their patients. And in some
cases, that may require an abortion.

Despite the moral debate over whether or not an abortion is
“right,” the fact is that the procedure is currently within the
bounds of the law. Since the Supreme Court ruled in Roe v.
Wade, there has been no lawto overturn the legality of perform.-

O ing or having an abortion. And because an abortion is still legal,
it is perfectly within the bounds of the medical community to
see that medical students are properly trained in performing
them. ,

No one would argue that the proper technique for performing .
an appendectomy or tonsillectomy should not be taught to med-
ical students. That is the function of medical schools. If proper
procedures were not taught, we might as well go back to the
medieval method of barber-surgeons taking on apprentices. An
abortion is no different from any other legal medical procedure
in that it could be used to save a life.

It makes sense that there are certain things a person should be
fully trained in before he or she can be certified to practice med-
icine. And it also makes sense that when a person receives a
medical degree, he or she should be fully equipped to serve as a
general medical practitioner, capable of taking whatever actions
are necessary to save a life in a given situation. In some cases,

‘ saving a life does require an abortion. And medical practitioners
should be trained and capable of performing them.

At present, students from the University of Pittsburgh’s med-
Tical school are given the choice of whether or not to learn the
‘procedures for performing an abortion. But the proposed

I ACGME regulation will change that. Even though they may
never find themselves in need of the knowledge they will have
gained, and doctors will never be required to perform abortions
in a situation other than an emergency, the knowledge medical
students gain by learning abortion procedures will, without a
doubt, save lives. A

Journalism wars

As the station manager for
WPTS-FM, I would like to
address the issues set forward
in Mike Kovak’s Oct. 23
attack of WPTS-FM. As pri-
marily a music station, I find
that it is our responsibility to
give the student population, as
well as the listening audience,
a chance to hear something
new, something exciting and
something different. While
athletics are important at this
university, we also feel that we
have something non-tradition-
al to offer. WPTS-FM is one
of the few outlets in the city
for local music, “new” music
and something other than cor-
porate programming.

We here at WPTS-FM
would rather solve any internal
problems within our own
tight-knit family. But unfortu-
nately, this problem was not
brought to my attention via the
proper channels, and I must
resort to playing this silly little
pot-shot game of politics. I
find it hard to believe that I
open The Pitt News and, to my
dismay, read a slanderous arti-
cle from a person that has
never made one attempt to talk
to me or anyone of proper
authority with their vital con-
cerns. As to the idea that we
deliberately sabotage the
Sports Journal  that idea is so
off the wall that I’d just as
soon discuss the odds of the
Sports Journal continuing its
broadcasts... ‘

Another concept that I
would like to counter is that of
“certain jerks  ruining peo-
ple’s chances of improving
their career skills and having
fun.” First of all, we’re dis-
cussing a Sports Journal which
is being broadcast for a total of
one and one-half hours week-
ly, with occasional game cov-
erage. We are a self-sufficient
media source which broadcasts
in general for the other 166.5
hours weekly. No considera-
tion was given to the interrup-

tion of other people’s shows,
nor to their inalienable right to
have a good time. And finally,
in response to the supposition
“...that few listen to the station
except when the Sports
Journal airs...” In reality, we
have received hundreds of
calls for some specialty shows;
can this Sports Journal boast
the same? More importantly,
can they prove it? Is this the
kind of investigative reporting
that we must adhere to? Mr.
Kovak’s column proves that
you need no facts to be pub-
lished, and also no writing
ability. Was this column a fee-
ble attempt to find a scapegoat
toward his “most disappoint-
ing weekend,” or was it just
childish antics from a misin-
formed would—be broadcaster?

In short, we here at the sta-
tion are very discouraged at
Mr. Kovak’s column, and find
it extremely hypocritical that
someone with this much nega-
tive energy directed towards
the station would have enough
gall to go against his morals
and continue to be associated
with it!

Corporate welfare

Welfare is a common topic
of discussion in politics.
Everyone wonders why our
taxes are going toward some-
one living better on welfare
than people with jobs. Why
should we continue giving
money to those who are living
off the govemment’s wasteful
spending policies? Maybe
because these same people are
giving the money right back to
the campaign funds in support
of those elected officials that

believe in giving subsidies to.

the least-talked-about form of
welfare, corporate welfare.
Although we claim that the
“free market” is the best possi-
ble economic policy, our gov-

ernment doesn’t always act
that way.

Take a company like Archer
Daniels Midland, which has
reported sales in 1994 of over
$11 billion and profits of $484
million. For some reason the
government gives ADM $2.1
billion over five years for a
corn-derived ethanol subsidy.
It also enjoys benefits (in both
dollar amounts and pre-
dictability) from the
Agriculture Department’s
sugar program and its corn-
price support program.

During the 1992 election,
the CEO of ADM gave more
than $1.4 million in varying
campaign contributions. This
support has continued through
the years, showing up in many
different campaign funds for
both Republicans and
Democrats, which seems
almost like an indirect way of
using tax money to support
campaigns. The U.S.
Department of Agriculture
also spends $85 million annu-
ally on consumer marketing
for exporting products from
McDonald’s, Campbell’s
Soups and many others.
Pharmaceuticals companies
receive $4 billion in tax breaks
annually in U.S. possessions
such as Puerto Rico.

This is a very small list and
leaves out some other big sub-

sidies like mining, sugar,

nuclear energy and more
which receive varying
amounts of subsidies often
reaching the billion dollar
level. So next time you get
upset with that person in the
checkout line in front of you at
the grocery store with food
stamps, make sure you’ve
bought your share of sugar and
soup, because welfare is sup-
posed to help those poor multi-
million-dollar businesses pay
their CEOs’ million-dollar a
year wages.

or the
_ fir st
time in

recent memo-
ry, parity has
not prevailed
in college

football.
Columnist Right
Mike now, there are
Kovak four unde-

feated teams.

They are Nebraska, Florida

State, Florida and Ohio State.

No team in the Associated

Press Top 25 has more than
two losses. b

With all the parity and bad

- play this season in the NFL, a

great college season is just
what the doctor ordered.

However, nothing is perfect.
There” is a problem in the
NCAA.

The problem is there is a
very good chance that three
teams will go undefeated into
the bowl games. Nebraska and

Ohio State will not lose this-

year, and the winner of the
FSU—F1orida game will play in
the Fiesta=Bowl for the nation-
al title.

Will justice be served this
year? I doubt it. The NCAA is
the most corrupt corporation
this side of Don King
Promotions. That means that
once again an undefeated team
will be whining, much like Joe
“I’m the Biggest Fraud This
Side of Don King Promotions”
Patemo. _

The rankings system this
year is not giving enough cred-
it to teams that deserve to be
ranked higher, and too much
credit to teams that have been
perennial powerhouses.

I have devised my official
top 10 football teams in col-
lege football to this point of
the season. This should wipe
away any discrepancies later in
the year — that is if things take
their natural course.

1. Ohio State — Why is this
team ranked fourth? Every
week the Buckeyes have
played a ranked opponent and
beaten them soundly, with the
exception of Pitt. They’ve
crushed Boston College,
Washington, Notre Dame,
Iowa and Penn State. They’ll
go undefeated. .
2. Nebraska — This potent
running machine is assured a
shot at the Fiesta Bowl after a
44-21 dismantling of Colorado
in Boulder. With Lawrence
Phillips slated to return, watch
out. The Huskers have the best
legitimate shot at winning the
title, even though they're not
the best team.

Pih‘ fies seoson-schoo/
record with 72 wins  

By Connie Nigro
Staff Writer

The Pitt soccer team took a giant step toward claiming a

spot in the Pitt soccer history books with its seventh con— . 

secutive win. With the win, the 1995-96 soccer team tied
the school record for most wins (12) in one season. The
win also gives the Panthers 14 points, which moves them
into a tie for first place with Boston College in the Big
East.

Goalie Adam Spitzer moved one game closer to the
school record of shutout wins (10), which he set in the
1992 season. The shutout was Spitzer’s sixth this season.

The Panthers tamed the Villanova Wildcats on Sunday
when they beat them 1-0 in double -overtime. The win
brings the Panther overall record to 12-4.

The Panthers are now 7-2 in Big East play. They sur-
passed the record for most conference wins in a season (6),
which they set last week by defeating Notre Dame. The
school record now stands at seven conference wins in a
single season.

“I couldn’t be prouder,” coach Joe Luxbacher said. “It
was a hard-fought game on both sides.” _

Hard—fought would be one way to describe a game that
went on for 115 minutes without a goal, as this one did.
But, for Pitt and Villanova, this kind of game seems to be
the norm. This is the fourth consecutive season in which
the matchup between Pitt and Villanova has resulted in a 1-
0 score. '

At 114254 in double overtime, Pitt.scored the game-win-
ning goal. The play started with a corner kick, and senior
forward Todd Graf headed the ball in for the score.

As in any scoreless game, when time becomes a factor,
tempers begin to flare. This game was no exception. Five
different players were yellow-carded for their choice in
play tactics.

“It was a feisty game,” Luxbacher said.

Despite the penalties, Pitt managed to retain its compo-
sure long enough to pull out the win. Senior captain J.L.
Gorsin played a key role in keeping everything going. 2

“In my opinion, he was the man of the match,”

The Pitt Panther swim

team swept its first meet
of the season this past
week, with the women’s
team defeating Ohio
University 128-115 and
the men dominating the
Bobcats 170-70.
“The women’s‘ squad was
led ‘by Irene Stergios and
Samantha Chabotar, who
each won two individual
races in the meet.
Stergios took the 200-
meter freestyle and but-
terfly events, while
Chabotar captured both
the 500- and 1,000—meter
freestyle competitions.
Other individual winners
for Pitt were Erin Bissel,
Jenny Banks, Jill Fletcher
and Amy Spinnenweber,
who won the three-meter
diving competition.

Junior John Soulakis
took both the one- and
three-meter diving events
for the men’s squad with

scores of 305.10 and
293.70, respectively. “I
was real happy with the
way I dove,” said
Soulakis, who will cap-
tain the divers this sea-
son.

For the men’s swim-
mers, the relay team of
Eric Stull, Chris Balke,
Mike Tortorici and Tony
Sunseri took first in the
400-meter freestyle relay.\

Pete Hezky won the indi-  I

vidual medley and took
the 500-meter freestyle
contest with a career best
time. Eric Stefansky,
Steve Lewter and Bob
Nooning swept the 100-
meter freestyle race,
while Lewter and‘Chris
Perry led the medley
relay team to a victory.‘

“The guys reallygstayed
focused,” said men’s
coach Chuck Knoles.
“This was probably the
fastest opening dual meet
since I've been here.“

3. Florida — Danny Wuerffel
and the rest of the offense can’t
be stopped. They’ll beat FSU
and face Nebraska in the Fiesta.
4. Florida State — This team
is overrated. Out of 105
Division I programs, the
Seminoles’ schedule ranks
104th. '

5. Northwestern — The
Wildcats are on top of the Big
Ten with a 5-0 conference
record. If they continue to win,
they may throw a monkey
wrench in Ohio State’s well-
oiled engine. They’ve beaten
Notre Dame and Michigan,
both on the road.

6. Tennessee — The Vols
looked real bad against the
Gators, but they’ve killed
everyoneelse.

7. Kansas State —— I can’t
believe that the state of Kansas
is enjoying the best college
football season of any state
besides Florida. This team
should win the remainder of its
games.

8. Michigan — This team is
the most disappointing team in
the top 10. They looked horri-
ble against Northwestern at
home, and ruined an undefeat-
ed Wolverine-Buckeye
matchup.

9. Notre Dame — This is a

good football team. Whether
you like it or hate it, learn to
love it. Those two losses are
deceiving — they've come
against outstanding clubs.

10. Kansas — The Jayhawks
get blown out by K-State, but
then blow out Colorado.

Even though controversy will
creep up again this season, and
with Pitt’s dismal performance
on the gridiron, at least a few
other teams have made this the
best college season of the
1990s.

“excellent opening swim,”

Festival to sweep first
through sixth place in the
500-meter freestyle.

notching their first win-

over OU in eight years.

EVERY PERSON WHO BECOMES ADDICTED E}-

TO TOBACCO BEGINS WITH
"JUST USING IT ONCE IN A WHILE"

ONCE YOU'RE HOOKED,
rr's HARD TO KEEP THE
LID ON THIS ADDICTION!

It doesn't take long to get
addicted to smokeless tobacco
& it is not a safe substitute for
cigarettes. Smokeless tobacco
contains more nicotine than
cigarettes.

ONCE YOU'RE HOOKED,
IT'S HARD TO SEE REALITY
BEHIND THE CLOUD OF SMOKE!

 

In the last 12 months, cigarette
smoking has cause over 300,000
deaths. Incredibly, 40% of Pitt
students report they smoked
cigarettes during that time.
