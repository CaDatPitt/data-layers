  On Economy Depression

’—t¢~_
, I;-~-_

BY TOM WASELESKI

Twenty-four percent of Pitt stu-
dents polled believe the United
States, and. in effect; the world, is
headed for a major depression. A
recent Gallup poll showed 51% of
the nation believes a depression is
on the way.

In a survey taken on campus
yesterday, 40% of student re-
spondents felt that a depression is
not in the making, while the
remaining 36% were undecided.

Working toward his doctorate in
cultural anthropology, Rolando
Alum agrees with Newsweek's
Paul Samuelson, who "has stated
certain factors needed for a de-

'93!-"x pression are not present in the

‘Pi

American economy.

“Samuelson takes into considera-
tion the factors that were present
before the last great depression,
and he feels we don’t have those
factors now," said Alum. “Gov-
ernments are a lot wiser today, and
no country in the world operates on‘

a simple capitalist system. By this I A

mean that there are curbings and
restrictions nowadays built into the
economy."

In opposition, biology major Rob-
ert .I. Gamerro believes a depres-
sion is “inevitable.” I ‘

"A depression always follows.

News. "Thery can't reverse it."

President Ford's atte'mpt to defeat
“public enemy No. 1" is a package
bill including a 5% income tax
surcharge on corporations and
middle to upper income individu-
als, and a Federal budget short to
$300 billion. But his WIN program
("Whip Inflation Now'.') has come
under fire by Democrats who call it
a mere popgun attack on the
nation's mostgserious problem.

Roland Smith, the designated
chairman of the black studies
department. resigned Monday,
following nearly a week of protest
by black students, faculty mem-
bcrs, and community leaders who
advocate the appointment of
Curtiss Porter to thelpost. u,
‘The action, which took the form of
a letter to FAS Dean Jerone
Rosenberg, who had named Smith
to the position only one week
before, interrupts a review of the
appointment being conducted per-
sonally by Chancellor Wesley W.
Posvar.

He had agreed to examine the
situation after listening to black
leaders last Friday who told him
the administrative process which
selected Smith over Porter was not
fair.

Rosenberg said yesterday that the
result of Smith's resignation would
be apparent “very soon, probably

by the end of the week." But he‘

w.ould not speculate whether the
decisi_on would be the naming of
Porter to the post. or the beginning

of a new search process for a
chairman of the black studies
department.

However, Rosenberg added the
decision would result from normal
academic channels, meaning he
will .make the decision based on
consultation and approval from

Provost _Rhote_n Smith.” “And as _

always,” he added, “the decision
is subject to the review of the
Chancellor.”

Executive assistant to the Chan-
cellor Ray Coble said yesterday he
knew of no plans for a new search

.to begin, but promised that any

resulting decision would be made

' S0011 .

“But the Chancellor will keep to
his commitment to the black
students to make a statement by
Friday on the process which
selected Roland Smith," Coble
added. '

“I withdrew primarily because of
the high aspirations I have for the
black studies department at the
University of Pittsburgh," Smith
explained in anvinterview Monday.
“I want it to move forwardin its
growth." My. candidacy‘ under the
present conditions would only hin-
der that process.“

In his letter to Rosenberg, Smith
indicated he was misled in assum-
ing that “the search committee
would not include on its final list a
candidate that the relevant consit-
tuenciesi would subsequently re-
ject.

"The problem," Smith comment-
ed later, “was that after the Search_
Committee made its recommenda-
tion. some individuals emerged in
opposition to the ﬁnal ‘decision.

Socialist Party Strives Fori

Recognition

BY BILL HADUCK

Bucking a system they claim
supports “skyrocketing prices,
rising unemployment, racism, sex-
ism, and deterioration in the qual-
ity of life," the Socialist Workers
Party (SWP) enters the last few
days of election campaign 1974

with two underage ‘major candi-_

dates and a hope more for recogni-

‘ tion than victory.

“At this point, 1 think it’s very

unlikely I will be elected,” said,.

SWP candidate for US Senator
Christina Adachi, a Pitt under-
graduate in education. “If I was
elected, it '-fwould probably be as

The leader of the black students-

resignation puts the University in7i'i
an easier position to decide "Porter

“If a depression does come," she
said. “maybe it will teach us
something for the future. like how
wasteful Americans are. how we
take everything for granted. and
how the government is controlled
b_y big business."

Don Green. an engineering stu-
dent foresees a recession rather
than a depression. “The. govern-
ment has gone through a depres-
sion before. and they realize what
can occur. We might be in a
recession right now; if we are. then
there's going to be some formal
change in the economy after it's
over."

Sophomore Patti Lee agreed.
“We’re going into a recession. I
think the government has too much
control to allow it to go as far as a
depression."

A biology student. Mike Smayda.
said. "'l‘hey'll get it stopped before
it gets there—-the government has a
way of handling it."

"’l‘liey'l| never let it slide that
far." observed John Pctanovieh.

Randy Stephenson showed con-
cern over the ramifications of a
depression. "If there is a depres-
sion. it won't be like the one in the
l93()‘s. ljust hope they don‘t find a
war to get us out of one."

France, but I don’t think anyone in
Paris would have predicted it.”
Scherr, a former student at Case
Western Reserve University in
Cleveland, agreed. “Our election
would be part of a struggle of
working people. It would be a
reflection of a change of the
political mood of the state and the
country. _ .
The mood of the country may b
changing, however, Scherr feels.
“After Watergate, American
people are fed up with the Demo-
’ she said.

’‘‘We find that people now are more

willing to listen to us.”

“We’ve also distributed hundreds .

of thousands of pieces of campaign
literature, which we never could do
before, and we’ve collected more
money and even recruited more
members in YSA (Young Socialist
Alliance) than we’ve ever done
before.”

Scherr said the major issue in her
campaign was inflation. “But just
electing me is not going to end
inﬂation,” she added. “We’ve got
to change the attitudes of this
country. We've got to get rid of the

 iyyar budget and put that money into

the construction of schools and
housing.” '
“Working people should not have

I to bear the brunt of inflation,” she

said. “There-should be an escala-

system that it would only seem
logical that a socialist movement
might be the next step,” she said.

“The thing is that you’re not
going to leave something behind
until you have something else first.
Sowhat we’ve got to do is convince
people that socialism is superior to
what they have now.” 7

Although the candidates had rela-
tively little to say about the
opposition they face in next week's
election, Scherr and Adachi did not
completely ignore them.

“They attack each other on such
trivial matters, instead of getting to
the root of the problem,” Scherr
said.

campaign as a new outlook for
Pennsylvania. The only new outlok
I see is Drew Lewis’ smiling face
looking out from billboards.

than Lewis or Shapp. We’ré the"-;

ressing the political issues.” "
Some other issues the candidates?
have spoken out on follow: 
POLLUTION: “It’s quite clear we
have the science and technology 't""
stop the pollution problems oflithe
world,” Adachi said. “Corpora
tions like US Steel are afraid it will 5
cut into their profit margins‘, rj
though.” ‘ ,1.”
CAMPAIGN REFORM: “The laws.’
they have now are an Iabsoluteffl.
sham,” said Adachi. “They wanteaiff
list of all our campaign‘ contribu-"7
tors. Why should we hand them afh
ready made enemies list?”_ ' " "
CORRUPTION IN GOVERN
MENT: “You read about groups
like Pennsylvanians for Progre'ss;”""
Scherr said. “It’s all a deal for the”)
Shapp campaign to get money from
bulsinessmen who have construc-
tion contracts with the state.”.

Black Studies Forum

1, f'.The resignation Monday of Dr. Roland Smith nearly one week after
; students protested his appointment by the Pitt administration has
, ' further complicated and dramatized the controversy surrounding the
~- "appointment of a_ Black Studies chairman.
A search committee recommended to FAS dean Jerome Rosenberg
[three names for the Black Studies chainmnship. They were Constance
Achonochu, Roland Smith, and Cmtiss Porter. Porter is now the only
 available for the position who was also recommended by the
‘search committee. Additionally, it should be noted that in an
‘unprecedented move the search committee, in a letter to Rosenberg,
, gave Porter special support for the job. ’
‘ Rosenberg, however, selected Smith, and refuses to state the reasons
‘for his decision. But, what happens now? VV1ll Curtiss Porter, the
favorite candidate of the students, the search committee, and the black
‘studies department and the community be named chaimian? Is there
any reason at this point why he will not be named chaimian?
» One thing, however, is evident. The issues involved in this crisis
I must be completely explained to the University community. A forum to
discuss the mission of the black studies department and its future must
be held in order that the department will be able to continue to grow
-E and prosper and truly provide an educational and social experience for
those enrolled in the department.

This forum, originally recommended by Ourtiss Porter, should be held
before a chairman of the black studies is appointed. In this way the
issues will have had a public hearing and the new chairman will, then,
be able to work with the black studies faculty and students in
 furthering the ‘goals of black people.

 A We hope the call for this forum will not go unheeded. This would
 provide an unprecedented opportunity for ‘ administrators, faculty,
-Vgstudents, and all other interested parties to air their differences and
:‘ , then approach the problems confronting black studies with cooperation

A ‘_ and dedication to their resolution.

“The FAS Resolution

The faculty’s vote last Saturday in support of FAS Dean Jerome
 Rosenbergjs decision to name Roland Smith as Black Studies Chairman
 over Curtiss Porter was ill-timed, inappropriate, unconscionable, and- a
' gross insult to students and other members of the University
community concerned with the quick resolution of this controversy.
The resolution, co-sponsored by Physics department chairman Dr.
Philip Stehle and assistant professor of Black Studies and political
'science Emmanuel Anise, called on the clean to remain ﬁrm against

 non-participation in the selection process were not legitimate. The

It’s Registration Time Againm

BY BILL MOORE
I think it is clear to the majority
of people that if indeed the world is
not a ghetto, it is at least a fairly
rundown apartment complex.

Along the same lines, although
everybody may not be a star, the
majority of people can at least lay
claim to being minor planets.

So, as you no doubt have
construed by this time, we will find
ourselves in the near future
confronted with the problem of
choosing winter term courses.

Registering, ascertain University
bigwigs like to call the process of
choosing courses, can be much
simpler than it seems.

students once that, indeed, every-

thing is much simpler than it.

seems, but that is no concern of
ours since Kafka was wrong

' anyway.

In choosing courses, a conscien-
tious student, (I hope no one
objects to my using the term
conscientious but, if so, pardon
me), must consider four main
criteria.

is this merely a student’s pipe-

Schweiker: Inﬂation Fighter

BY DOUG YAUGER

He has been seen everywhere.
Yesterday, he was sighted in a local
grocery store, changing the price
on a box of Cheerios. He trans-,
formed the innocent seventy-cent
box into an ugly seventy—seven cent
monster. Later on in the day he was
seen at the local gas station, giving
two gallons to the dollar that last
year bought three. ‘

He has been called every name in
the book. President Fordccalls him
Public Enemy Number One. His
common name is inflation.

The effects of inflation are felt by
all of us, including our lawmakers,
many of whom are seeking re-elec-
tion this year. One such legislator
is Senator Richard Schweiker
(R-PA.), who provides us with
concrete measures to stem the
rising tide of inflation. ' A

dream? Really, that is a legitimate
figure of speech, no one is trying to
claim all students are pot smokers.

2) If the course is offered, is it
offered at Pitt, or someplace’ else?
Take it from someone who knows,
commuting to Buffalo gets to be
quite a drag, and it's hell on the
feet.

3) Do you want to take the course?
Taking a, course out of mere
exultation at its being offered is not
a wise move. You just may get
stuck with one of the _two or three
courses offered here that some
students have called “almostly
slightly less than perfect."

So, let us say that you’ve found a
few courses satisfying all of these.
May we say it? Okay} You have
found a few courses satisfying all of
these. What next?

A logical step would be to check
with your advisor. If he or she is not
in, stop back later in the day. If
your advisor is in, drop to your

of the American consumer above
the interests of the Russian con-

Senator Schweikerbelieves the
major oil companies should be
regulated as public utilities. We
must ease the plight of the Ameri-

“translating oil company profits
into lower prices at the pump.”

Q..-/‘Defending the

Lewis Campaign

Dear Sir:

This letter is [in response to an ,

editorial statement made by the
Pitt News on Oct. 23. 1974 entitled
“The Lewis Campaign."

As you know, the first few lines of
the article dictated the necessity for
a forum as an essential part of any
political campaign. With this I
think anyone would agree. How-
ever, the article continued to
dictate with a series of “is not’s”
and “should not’s” that Lewis has

1/ﬁr‘ -‘led to rovidel a forumwithin the
. 42-{ , P

outlines of his campaign and that
he has used nothing but so-called
“smear tactics” with no positive
statements or proposals of his own.

The article concluded with and

additional statement that he has
marshalled only worn public rela-
tion gimmicks in his behalf.

After reading this I could not help
thinking that the editors of the Pitt
News should do less in telling Drew
‘how to run his campaign and more
in providing an outlet for the forum
they so strongly advocate. Had
they done so the student body
would realize that Drew has, on

A‘/-4":-:r:‘veI’al occasions, personally of-

.i.. ..

ts‘-.~

fcred to discuss the issues with
Milton Shapp on state wide TV,
only to be totally ignored. Shappls
reasons being. “Lewis is either
misinformed, he doesn't read, or
he deliberately falsifies his infor-

 

‘sf:

mation."

The article also criticized Lewis’
expensive public relations cam-
paign as falsely depicting _the
issues. This I feel is nothing more
than a gross and biased interpreta-
tion of the facts. Lewis came into
this race relatively unknown in
certain areas of the state, Pitts-
burgh being one of these areas.
Accordingly, television would be
the most obvious and efficient
means of making the candidate
known. Afterall, doesn't any new
face need an introduction? In
contrast, Mr. Shapp had the ex-

pense of his 1970 campaign,» an .

estimated three times the amount
Lewis will spend this__year alone,
and the four years of his admin-
istration to make his name known.

As far as the issues go, Shapp
claims that his programs to date
have worked. Lewis has said that it
is a matter of opinion, his being
that they haven't. Contrary to what
the Pitt News would have its
readers believe, Drew has outlined
in numerous news releases how he

;:The conductor is rarely on time
for rehearsal, and the air in the tiny
ccoustical practice room hung
motionless and heavy; an idle
"-glrummer rapped his sticks on a
shcan as the room slowly crowded
with latecoming student musicians
“savvy to the conductor’s ways. It
was another Wednesday night
rehearsal of the University of
'_-Pittsburgh Jazz Ensemble and only
‘now, after the September auditions
[and a month of twice-weekly
% reh’earsals,,was the band beginning
 o sound like a unit and the
L:-conductor was beginning to be

»was casting about for concert dates
-for the ensemble, setting up a
"tentative benefit performance for
- the YMCA in November, an
announcement he would spring on
them tonight. .
“The Jazz Ensemble, mostly
student musicians, although their
number is sprinkled with a few
_ professional musician friends of the
conductor, performs without pay,
'_ L and despite the fact remunerations
if ‘ would be an added attraction for
"these 21 musicians, the real
attraction here is the conductor.
 ‘Twenty minutes of rehearsal time
’ is gone now, but the band, like
‘always is taking its cue from
Nathan Davis, and they’re relaxed
and loose. .
 V‘ When Nathan Davis played Paris
 "with Ray Charles years ago, there
g'_ was a premium on rehearsal time
‘ff and the blind man would fine the
 band members $50 for every late
:, fminute of rehearsal and a $100 ﬂat
,_;j.',f'1ne if one of his musicians came to
1,: band too drunk to play. That,

 

,7 proud of the “gettin’ mean.” He ,

Nathan Davis likes to recall, was
the strictest and most expensive
band he ever worked for. In Paris,
he was saying qui-it this, hell we
ain’t makin’ enough money to
STAY with this here hand.

But Davis is in it deep now, too
deep ever to quit, nor does he think
of it. Davis plays jazz, he says,
because that’s all the music there is
and he likes to think of himself as a
musician, just a musician. While he
was growing up in Kansas City,
where the vortex of jazz musicians
had shifted south from Chicago and
west from New Orleans in the late
l920’s, Davis’ father played drums
and he followed his mother, who
sang gospel, on the Baptist church
and revival tent circuit, playing the
sax while she sang.

I was a good player because I
wanted to be a good player, Nathan
Davis will attest, making light of
the eight or nine hours he
practiced daily with the Charles
band and later, performing with his
own band, in Paris, and the four
hours he is still logging with his sax
every day.

Davis slipped quietly into the
rehearsal room at -the Music
Building, the old WQED television
station at Fifth and Belleiield, and
although barely half of the
musicians had yet arrived, the stale
air in the accoustical room

electrified and the musicians’

passing time did it just ever so
much sharper, straining for that
finer edge to their sound that sets
amateurs away from professionals.
Barrelchested, with thick street-
fighter’s legs, Nathan Davis moves
with the agility of an alleycat.
Carrying a cassette tape player and

3. disc of his latest album, due for
release in late October, Davis
strode to the piano and the scrawny
student keyboardist Vince Genova,
who Davis commissioned to play
keyboards with the professionals in
his own band on the recording. It’s
the first time Genova or the
students have heard any part of the

recording, and although the cas-’

sette is scratchy and the reproduc-
tion is poor, the room grows silent
and close save for that sound, to
hear the jazz, rush on, building to a
wrenching crescendo from Davis’
tenor sax that brings a loud,
ecstatic ooo-o-o-Wheel from Geno-
va.

Davis will wait, but not for long,
for musicians that come to
rehearsal later than himself, and
joking about instituting the Ray
Charles rates, sends a student to
call Clyde, a professional trumpet
player and the mainstay of the
ensemble’s brass section. The
professionals in the ‘band make his
job easier, Davis will claim, setting
the pace and helping out the
students in each section. And
indeed, when the percussionists
ran into difficulty getting a certain
syncopated beat down just right,
Davis’ own‘ percussionist, JC, a
gangling jiving man, just slid into
the rhythm section and showed
them how, and stayed with them
until they got it right.

The band tonight was going to
“get mean” on its book , meaning
it was going to begin to put
together, the repertoire of songs
they had learned pat, and could cull
a program from later. Davis,
salmtering, shuffling around, ca-
joled the band with his standard
speech: “All I need is your
determination your gonna jump on
your parts. We been on all this
before, an we’re gonna «start
gettin MEAN now. We’re gonna go
through a lot of pieces and when we
hit--BAM-- we’re ‘gonna LAY on
that and we LAY on it an LAY on it.
An we put together that book and
then we just HIT it. An yous gonna

The little cajole runs on, and he
can’t resist not ‘ taking himself
unseriously and he says, shufﬂing
the score to “Backbones” spread
in front of him, “Ya know I always
used to admire them dudes they
was dynamite ya know, in between
their parts they’d get a drink, take
a hit on a chick mebbe, then BAM
they’re RIGHT back there where-

Then contorting his voice into a
sax to give the band a beat...um
OW..umOW...buOW OW...hu-u-

But her outward friendliness dis-

task before her—fighting racism

to heart.

“To combat racism you‘ve got
to build a movement." Davis said
earlier in the day when she met in
a private rap session with student
leaders. “And that movement is.

really on trial. It was just an-
other action against people who
rise up and oppose the traditional
forces.

"But is the judicial system
good?" Angela Davis asks the stu-
dents. who edge closer and closer
to hear the remainder of the
story. “Think about this. The pro-

secution had 400 witnesses lined
up. To prepare a defense we had
to interview everyone of them-
which sometimes meant flying a
law_ver to New York. I don't think
I had a cent when I was arrested—
maybe $100. If it hadn't been for
the movement. I" would have had
a public defender. who would
probably have advised ‘cop a plea
and try to get a good deal.‘

“But you seeee." Angela Davis
continues. looking in all direc-
tions to maintain eye contact with
her listeners. "Most blacks. most
Chicanos. most Puerto Ricans.
and most poor people who go on
trial in this country don't have
the movement behind them. And

 

so what kind of trial do they get‘?
The National Alliance Against
Racist and Political Oppression
was organized as a direct result
of the "Free Angela" movement.
which was at its height three
years ago when Davis was in-

carcerated in California. Two
days after the acquital. Davis
says. the Movement began to

transform in an attempt to re-
lease other political prisoners.
"You must understand them."
Angela Davis said later to the
larger audience in the auditorium.
“That if it weren‘t for the move-
ment. if it weren't for the strug-
gle. I wouldn‘t be here tonight."
However. it is actually an un-
fortunate experience that forced
the speech into Lawrence Hall.
which seats about 900. instead of
a larger hall in the immediate
Oakland area. Members of the

Black Action Society iBAS> who
sponsored the program. had tried
but failed to arrange accomoda—
tions at one of these auditoriums.
And the owners of those places
still would object to having .~\n-
gela Davis as a guest.

“No sir we just put in $200,000
worth of new seats and we don't
want them destroyed,” said a
Syria Mosque official. “She's been
involved in riots hasn't she‘? We
can‘t risk it.” And the same re-
action came from Soldiers and
Sailors who would not host Davis
either “because she is anti-war
and this is a war memorial honor-
ing the dead of the war," a spokes-

man said.

It seemed even Student Govern-
ment leaders who hand out the
money for these programs were
hesitant to see Angela Davis ap-
pear on campus. as they first re-
fused BAS‘s request for funding
on the basis that the organization
was asking for too many political
speakers. But eventually the Stu-
dent Government was persuaded
to fund the project.

"I don't know why they brought
in Angela Davis. she isn't rele-
vant anymore." This comment by
one student yesterday does not
characterize the entirestudent
attitude at Pitt. but it goes a long
way. And it is not coincidental
that the auditorium last night was
packed by black students. with
only patches of white seen
throughout the audience. And it
was not coincidental that it was

 

Wednesday. October 30, 1

the BAS—a black student organ-
i2ation—brought Angela Davis in
to speak. But it was coincidental
that she appeared one week to the
day after the militant action taken
by black students in the confronta—'
tion staged in the Chancellor‘s of-
fice. a protest that would rival
any at Pitt during the turbulent
60s.

But Angela Davis did make it to
Pitt, and although she had a lim-
ited audience last night, she was
active throughout the day, dis-
cussing racism with Black Studies
and philosophy faculty members
and student leaders.

"Why a

movement. Angela ‘.’

  
  
  

   

  Photo by Wilson
Why not work within the existing
processes?" someone wanted to
know during a discussion session.

 

Peering out from underneath
her chic afro. she replied softly.

' “If you understand the problem

of racism. and you are ready to
deal with these problems. then it's
your obligation to get out and edu-
cate those who don‘t know about
them. or those who don’t care.

“But you have to build a move-
ment to get the message across.
We can make\the decision right.
here and now—that we wantto
smash the racist capitalist so-
ciety lock. stock and barrel. and-
and—and—then what are you go-
ing to do’? Snap your fingers and
smash it‘? NO. You‘ve got to build
a movement if it's going to work.“

Somebody in a ‘small rap ses-
sion wanted to know what keeps

974—THE PITT NEWS——-Page 7

Angela Davis - Join The StruggleAgainst Racism  

Angela Davis going. “It‘s what
keeps all of us going—hope." An-
gela said. “We talked about all
the struggling at Wounded Knee‘?
Well finally we are seeing the
fruits of that struggle. Russell
Means and Dennis Banks are
freed. That's what collective abil-
ities are all about. This gives me
hope. And I guess its not a ques-
tion of how we keep going. but
that its the only way to go.“

Angela Davis, who did not speak
to many white people during the
course of the day, believes that
racism eventually harms the
white person too. “Racism is an
ideology to express the brutal ex-
ploitation of black people," she
says, “and while black people
might be enslaved by racism,
white people are exploited by the
same forces. The white people

might be out on the streets of.

South Boston throwing rocks at
the black children, keeping them
out of the schools, you know. But
that school in South Boston is one
ot' the worst schools in the coun-
try, and racism is keeping their
minds off that serious problem.”

President Ford is happy to see

all those screaming creatures in
South Boston. Davis told the 1.000
people at Lawrence Hall. “As long
as they're doing that. he can get
them to wear WIN buttons and
they will be satisfied."

During her 60 minute speech.
Angela Davis managed to con-
demn Nixon (America's number
one criminal). Ford (the Presi-
dent non-elect).
did say he didn’t control EVERY-
thing — there‘s something left
over for the Mellons). as well as
comment on political problems
such as Chile. the busing action in
South Boston and many more
cases of what she termed political
oppression or racism. "

And when it was over. it was
clear what Angela Davis would be
doing for the next few years. and
most probably for the rest of her
life—struggling for the cause of
.liberation. A black woman who is
free and is dedicated to freedom.
Angela Davis wants the people of
the world to befree also.

“Trekkies" Quiz Offered

“Star Trek" Eternal Success

BY KEN MINARIK

A little over eight years have
passed since Sept 8. 1906, the day
that the futuristic television drama
Star Trek premiered on the NBC
I television network. The show's life

’-Q2L.’._wz1s a short one; i_t ran for two

seasons and was cancelled, only to
be revived days later for a third
season as a result of rampant
viewer protests. _
Today, five years after that final
cancellation, the Star Trek phen-
omenon lives on. In paperback
versions, seven-‘and-one-half mil-
lion anthologies of Star Trek scripts
have been sold. Star Trek reruns
are now being shown in nearly
every major American city, making
it the number one television pro-
gram [nationally] shown between
the hours of 5 and 8pm [with the
exception of evening newcasts].__
_There are many more indications
of how and why the Star Trek
phenomenon continues. Animated
version of the show continues to
dominate Saturday morning tele-
vision ratings. According to stead-
fast critic Cecil Smith of the Los
Angeles Times. "NB‘C's new ani-
mated Star Trek is...fascinating
fare, written. produced. and exe-
.\cuted with all the imaginative skill.
the intellecutal ﬂare and the liter-
ary level that made Gene Rodden-
berry‘s famous old science-fiction
epic the most avidly followed
program in TV history." .
In less than three months, the
fourth annual Star Trek Interna-
tional Convention will convene in

New York City. The convention has _

grown continuously during its short
existence; last year four thousand
delegates jammed the convention
floor. '

Delegates to the convention are
normal, everyday individuals who
share one common trait; an uncan-
ny desire to know and understand
everything there is to know about
Star Trek. Just last week, Star Trek
fans obtained some shocking but
pleasant news...the starship En-
terprise now hangs in the Smith-
sonian Institute in Washington,
DC.

In Pittsburgh, a small _cult of
diehard'fans lives on. But, more
important. there are thousands of
"Trekkies" who have an above-
average knowledge of the show
that are Pitt students.

As a public service. the Pitt News
presents this Star Trek trivia quiz.
What is your Star Trek IQ?

stands among American classics,
has laid the proverbial egg. In his
latest collection of short stories (he
has written others--I haven't read
them and after this I certainly don't
intend to), Eight Mortal Ladies
Possessed. he gives us an accurate

portrayal of an artist losing touch‘

with his craft. And this. the most

. powerful idea found in the volume,

is not intended to be part of the
plots. We read it in between the
lines--as a matter of fact, we read it
in the pointless lines themselves.

The tragedy that Williams has
created by publishing this book
may be a direct result of the long
bout with alcohol and pills that
threw him into a mental institution
in 1969. Though all seems well with
him now, it doesn’t show on paper.
And as long as he keeps beating a
dead dog, he’ll be using up
precious pages that could be more
valuably utilized by -fresh, young,
enterprising authors. ~

His chief successes have been
plays: A Streetcar Named Desire
(winner of the Pulitzer. Prize), Cat
on a Hot Tin Roof (another
Pulitzer). Night of the Iguana, and
Suddenly Last Summer (which
starred Hal Holbrook in a celebrat-
ed TV version). But as this latest

Originality is the one thing a
medicore mind cannot stand; and
the surest sign of mediocrity is that
it feels comfortable only with the
familiar - indeed,- confuses the
familiar with the eternally right.

book is a prime example, Williams
isn't quite so dazzing in story form.

What he does retain throughout
all his works, though, is the old
Tennessee lust. I personally think
he'd be lost without it. Take, for
instance, one of his “ladies
possessed,” a certain “Miss
Coynte of Greene” [from the story
of the same name]. Finally giving
into her libido at age thirty, Miss
Coynte prefers black studs and
opens a curio shop where she
participates in her first acts of
ecstasy. For twenty-three pages we
find her lowering the shades,

hanging her out-to-lunch sign, and '

hopping up on the long counter
with her latest hired hand.
In “The Inventory of Fontana

Bella" Williams depicts an ancient ’

and slightly deranged woman of
the world who spends the day in a
stuporous fantasy involving her
long-dead fifth husband. The
story's high point comes when she
wrestles with a stork and repeated-
ly drives its pointed bill into her
vagina, crying, “Sebastiano, Se-
bastiano..._"

“Completed” deals with a girl of
twenty who has yet to experience’
the “curse of Eve.” But Williams
doesn’t focus on the traumas of
female puberty, nor on the
increased anxiety of it arriving
seven years late. He chooses
instead to tell about the girl’s
relationship with a morphine-
addicted aunt. Somehow morphine
and menstruation are intertwined.

“Oriflamme" and “Happy Au-
gust the Tenth" are hazy, portraits
of weak characters. “Sabbatha and

George C. Scott Interview

Actor Discusses Latest Film

(Continued from Page 8)

you deal with it as a microcosm of
society.

Scott: I think the microcosm is
attractive in a dramatic form be-
cause you can get at basic con-
cerns." It's an over-simplit"Icatio_n,
no doubt about that, but if you want
to distill anything, even major
complicated problems, you can
pretty much get down to two or
three basic threads. I think for
dramatic purposes it almost directs
itself thatithis has to be done.
QUESTION: At a certain point, the
father takes over the training of the
boy, the mother seems to retreat....
Scottzl think she attempts to con-
tinue her inﬂuence. The Bible
readings are part of that, and so is
the scene of remembrance and
reverie at the waterfall, There is an
indication that they both try, she in
her way, he in his, to be the
dominant influence over the son.
Of course the father wins, but in
doing so he loses, and the mother
loses at first, but in the end, wins.

QUESTION: A number of theatres .

which have purchased The Savage
is Loose have said they might run
the ﬁlm without a rating. What
would be the repercussions?

Scott: Under the rule of the MPAA
(Motion Picture Association) if you
either refuse to submit your picture
for a rating, or after it has been
rated, refuse to show the rating
publicly and inform the public what
it is, you're given an automatic X.
Even a Disney film. I have been
studying all sorts of court cases
dealing with the problem of the
Rating Board and censorship in
general. There are all sorts ‘of
problems. Whether the MPAA is a
closed, covert conspiracy, whether’
ithas constitutionally any power at
all? Or if NATO-and MPAA are
together in violation of the Sher-
man and Clayton Anti-Trust Acts

against independent producers
who refuse to have their picture
rated. It’s very convoluted and very
difficult.

QUESTION:One of the problems
with the Board seems to be that
there’s no way to recall Board
members. The public has no direct
contact with the organization.
Scott: I couldn't agree more and
that’_s one of the things that must
be changed. When I make my
second appeal, I’m going to ask for
a total identification of all persons
on the‘ Appeal Board and their
affiliation and I’m going to ask for a
publiotranscript of the proceed-
ings, which is never done. There is
no record. But one of the worst
things about the Board is that the
voting is secret. No exterior person
has any way of gaining knowledge
of how someone voted. The Su-
preme Court, Congress, City

the Gods that are on Mount

Councilmen, all have their votes
recorded for the public. But in this
private organization it isn't true.
I'm going to request that, and if
they deny my request then I can't
see but how they will lay them-
selves open for a conspiracy suit.
QUESTION: Your'plan of selling
The Savage is Loose outright to
exhibitors, bypassing distributors
and the major studios, is causing
some discussion. Do you feel most
people‘ within the industry‘ are
behind the plan?

Scott: Many creative people are
watching us closely, hoping we’ll
succeed. But I think a lot of people
are waiting to see it drop on its
head. Others want to see it succeed
because it would loosen the string
in this incredible superstructure

 

Olympus -- might have to take a‘
long look and revamp their policies.
The days of the monstrosity are
gone and some executives still look
back to the golden days of L.B.
Mayer. But I’m sorry. those days
are gone forever.

QUESTION: Would youigo back
now and do a film for a major
studio?

Scott: No. If I were to do that I
would have to, have such an

There are no easy games left for
the Pitt football team. True,’ the
Panthers may be travelling to
Syracuse this weekto meet a 2-5
team but they will also be playing a
hard-nosed squad that has been
improving every week and would
like nothing better than to upset
the highly favored Panthers.

No, one is more aware of the

talents of the Orangement than

head football coach Johnny Majors
who has been studying them
closely over the past several days in
preparation for .Saturday’s game, at

team, and for Jutca as well. On’.

Saturday he contributed one goal
and two assists to lead the team to
a win over Grove City. But earlier
in the year he was down, and quit
the team before the Temple game.

“I started the first three games
when I was a freshman, but then I
broke my leg and didn’t play any
more that year,” explains Jutca. “I
started every game when I was a
sophomore, too. ,But this year

‘Coach Bemiswas moving me from

position to position and I was
playing less, so I quit. I can play
just about any position on the field,
but I want to stay at one position.”

Jutca and Bemis got together,

Archbold Stadium. The Panthers
have quite a task ,,ahead of them
since the last time a Pitt team won
in Syracuse was back in 1960, and
since that time most of the contests
have been routs. And Majors, who
always comes off as the opposi-
tion’s biggest cheerleader the, week
of the game, is expecting the
Orangement to do. their best to
make life miserable for the Pitt
fans. .

"Syracuse is very sound," said
Majors at the weekly Pitt Media
Luncheon. “They don't give you

any big plays. I think they’re'Fai

better team than their record
shows. I think they're a tough
football team."

Fortunately for the Panthers, they
have no reason to be overcohfident.
Theygreally haven’t played that
well so far this season especially
last week against the Naval Aca-

demy. The Panthers made numer-

ous mistakes against the Mids and
nearly handed the game to their
enthusiastic opponents.

“We’ve been very good about
laying the ball on the ground,” said
Majors. “But against Navy we laid
four eggs\and it almost cost us the
game. We haven’t played against
anybody who blocked better than
they did or set up a better game
plan than they did.”

"Our offense was not that sharp,".
he continued. “although Daniels
did some good scrambling and
Dorsett playedia good game. Tony
ran harder than hell to go the yards

.he did. Our line didn’t block that

badly. We just made too »many
physical mistakes and mental mis-
takes.” -

Buckeyes Remain First

Temple Cracks Top 20

BY JAN PRIDDY
Associated Press Writer

PHILADELPHIA AP--A winning
attitude has helped the Temple
Owls topple its first six foes this
year. _ .

In recent years “we found more
ways to lose football games than
win them,” Temple Coach Wayne
Hardin said. “But we have now
learned how to win and have a
winning attitude.”

Following last Saturday's 21-17
victory over small college power
Delaware, Temple moved into 19th
place in The Associated Press‘
major college football poll.

Hardin cited the Delaware game
as the difference between this this
season's Owls and the past.

Delaware took a 17-14 lead in the

third‘ quarter only to see the Owls
win 21-17 on a 33 yard scoring pass

“from senior quarterback Steve Joa-

chim togleff Stempel.
“A few years ago we might have
folded when Delaware went ahead

when they had to.”

The nation's Top Ten teams
maintained their positions in the
AP poll, with runner up Oklahoma
chipping away slightly at the No. 1
ranked Ohio State’s comfortable
lead.

Ohio State routed Northwestern
55-7 Saturday and received 45 first
place votes and 1,222 of a possible
1,260 points from a nationwide
panel of sports writers and broad-
casters.

Meanwhile, Oklahoma crushed
Kansas State 63-0 and earned 14
first place votes and 1,123 points.

Third ranked Michigan. a 49-0
victor over Minnesota, received
two No. 1 votes, followed by fourth
place Alabama and fifth ranked
Auburn with one apiece. .

Southern Cal, Notre Dame. Texas
A&M, Nebraska and Penn State
round out The AP's Top Ten‘.

‘ Interviewed by telephone, Hardin
said “I really haven't had time to
thinkf about being ranked. I’m

_worriéd: about next we_e_k’s game

  

:lHardi‘n says he looks forward to

playing ranked teams ‘in the future.
The Owls have a 1975 date with
Penn State. And Hardin knows
that it's still early in the season.
No Temple team has ever been

Defense Encouraging

Mistakes   Hurt   Panthers

(Cu/1tinm'd from Pit]/F I2/l‘
mueh—nceded victory. They rose to
the occasion several times to stop

the struggling Navy attack in key~

series preventing them from pul-
ling off the upset. The play of the
defensive line during Navy's last
possession of the game was very
encouraging as they sacked quar-
terback Mike Roban twice and
batted down two passes to insure a
victory.

“Our defense was very encourag-
ing,” said Majors. “They made
good plays when they had to. The
last four plays were the biggest of
the game.”

However. defensive coordinator
Jackie Sherrill. who was also in
attendance yesterday. was not as
willing to praise his unit for their
play so far this season.”

‘'1 don't think the squad has lived
up to their potential so far." said
Sherrill. “But we've had some
injuries and they haven't really
been able to work together very
much." '

Saturday’s game will provide an
interesting sidelight as sophomore
defensive tackle Al Romano will be
returning to his hometown to play

    

AL ROM ANO
defensive tackle

before his family and friends.
Romano is well acquainted with
several of the Syracuse players
having gone up against some of
them earlier in his career and also
having worked out with several
Orangemen during this past sum-
mer.

“I played basketball with some of

the Syracuse players this sum»

mer." said Romano. "l played with
Jim Donohue (Syracuse starting
quarterback) and he was a good
basketball player and a good

athlete."
Romano is from Solvay, NY which
is a suburb of Syracuse. He

expressed a desire to move away
from home as one ofthe reasons for
not matriculating to SU which
recruited him while he was enrolled
in a local military school.

Romano and teammate Don ‘Parrish
will have an important job to do
Saturday as they apply the pres-
sure to the Donoghue who has a
strong arm and is sure to put the
ball in the air. Gary Burley, who
turned in another fine performance
against Navy will also be an

'important- factor in the game.

The Pitt offense had their mo-
ments against Navy and will face a
Syracuse defense which may be a
little small up front but has more
than enough strength to compen-
sate for their size. The Pitt offense
will be basically the same as went
up against Navy with Bruce Mur-
phy. who Syracuse coach Frank
Maloney calls “probably the best
wingback we will face.", Billy
Daniels. and of course Tony Dor-
sett. who gained 211 yards against
Syracuse last year, leading the
charge.

Jutca Unhappy With Pitt  

(Continued from Page 12)

however, and Alan rejoined the
squad.
When Jutca was a senior at

Trinity, he was recruited by 20

schools, including Penn , State,
Davis and Elkins, Wooster, and
several state schools in Pennsyl-
Vania.

“If I had to do it over again, I
don’t think’I would have gone to
Pitt,” Jutca feels. “At the time, I

and the ceaseless throwing when-
ever the opponent's defense war-

failed to set up the run in the
earlier games: the Steelers were
averaging just 3.8 yards per rush
over six weks. Atlanta's ground
defense isn't bad, just mediocre.

Of the Steelers’ previous foes,
three are better and three are
worse at stopping the run, but the
Steelers rushed 52 times for 235

before. The usually reliable Steel
Curtain defense suffered a strange
lapse and gave up two quick
touchdowns just before halftime,
allowing two consecutive comple-
tions for 74 yards and the TD that
tied the game 14-14 with 36
seconds left.

That points up what still stands as
the Steelers most serious defect,
the defensive backfield.
Pittsburgh's record in pass defense
has been good for.three years since
the secondary was widely dis-
cussed as a problem area.

But the reason for the success has
been- the ferocious pass rush that
sacked Falcon QB Bob Lee seven
times for losses totalling 63 yards.
On those rare occasions when his

protection held up, Lee had fair
success against the Steeler deep
backs, and better quarterbacks like
Denver’s Charley Johnson have
enjoyed even more.

Two years ago Howard Cosell was
calling the Steelers “the new
powerhouse of the NFL,” but they
don’t look quite so powerful now,
despite the reappearance of some
encouraging things Monday. Their’
5-1-1 record has been compiled
against teams with an aggregate
record of 19-29-1, and only Oakland
among them is above .500. _

Joe Gilliam alone was not
sponsible for Pittsburgh’s strug-
gling. The game plan had more to
do with it than anything else, and
its change Monday was much more
significant than the mere presence
of Bradshaw. Under whichever
signal-caller Noll selects, the chan-

4 Terps Improve Standing

BY GORDON BEARD

COLLEGE PARK Md. AP--
Maryland will try to atone for past
losses, improve its current ranking
and enhance future recruiting in
Saturday’s football battle against
Penn State.

are,” Maryland Coach Jerry Clai-

As for the past, the ‘Terps have

against Penn State and have drop-

Nittany Lions in 1961.

“We’re closer to Penn State now

While conceding that 10th ranked
Penn State is a tough opponent any
time, the coach of the 15th ranked
Terps figures it would have been
better in 1974 to play the game
earlier in the season.

“They have nine seniors starting ~

on ‘offense and six on defense,”
Claiborne said. “But most of them
didn’t play that much in the past.
Now, after"seven games, they’re
beginning to jell.”

Claiborne noted that Coach Joe

after some time for adjustment, the
Nittany Lions are “getting better
every week as they cut down on
mistakes." _

While getting used to the new
offense, however, Penn State has
outscored the opposition 184-67
and won six of seven starts.

“Their offense could _give us
trouble because it's something we
haven't looked at all year," Clai-
borne said. “We’re used to
playing against the wishbone and

which neutralize pursuit. You have
to stay ‘home,’ and search every-
body out before you can
anywhere."

Maryland have won five in a row
since losing to Alabama and Flor-
ida at the start of the season. The
Terps have outscored their oppon-
ents 163-22 during the winning
streak, including 139-10 in their
last four games.

The winning streak is the longest
for Maryland since the 1960 team
won its final two games and three
more were added at the start of the
1961 season.

 {Islanders Keeping Pace

UNIONDALE AP--There are
skeptics who still doubt the New
York Islanders “are for real" this
National Hockey League season,
despite six victories and a tie in
eight games--a record surpassed
only by the Los Angeles Kings,
who have played two more games.

Those doubters look beyond Mon-
day night’s 10-1 bout with the

f__California Golden Seals to a five

2. ‘games in eight nights stretch which

starts tonight and will have the
third year New Yorkers playing
against the New Yorkers playing
against the New York Rangers, the
Philadelphia Flyers twice, the Bos-
ton Bruins and the Atlanta Flames.

Islanders Coach Al Arbour is a

believer, though, as are his play-
ers. ,

“We'll take them one at a time,"
Arbour says. “All we gotta do is
keep on working the way we have
been and we'll come out all right.”

Hard work by Ed Westfall and Bill
MacMillan produced a pair of three
goal efforts and single scores by
Billy Harris, Gary Howatt, Ernie
Hicks and Bob Boume as the
Islanders took 47 shots in routing
two California goaltenders.

The Islanders have finished dead
last in their division their previous
two years, winning just 31 of 156
games. Entering their eighth game
last year they had lost four and tied
three. Over two years they allowed

594 goals while scoring just 352.

All that appears to have changed
now‘. At least now, people are

‘doubting them; earlier, there was

no doubt at all.

The Golden Seals are a different
story. Seven of their first 11 games
have been on the road, resulting in
six losses and a tie. They have
given up 52 goals--far worse than
the defensive record of the expan-
sion Kansas City Scouts and
Washington Capitals. And Mon-
day night’s bombardment forced
Coach Marshall Johnston to lift
starting goaltender Gary Simmons
in, favor of Gilles .MeIoche.
