Within a month, a confidential,
internal University of Pittsburgh
investigation should determine
the validity of current allegations
made primarily against Pitt
Director of Public Safety Wiﬂiam
Brennan by several members of
the department.

According to P1'ttNews sources,
the allegations include sexual
harassment, coaching certain
ofﬁcers before appearing before
a promotion board, evading
promotional guidelines and
promising jobs without providing
them.

In July, Brennan revamped the
promotion process, incorporating
the input of individuals outside

I of the department on a seven-

member panel. He also gave the

am

UNIVERSITY or PITTSBURGH

panel the questions to ask before
the interviews began. He said at
the time that he changed the
process to “pick the people who
are the most attuned to our new
service philosophy.”

Brennan refused to comment
on the allegations.

Upon conclusion of the
investigation, Lewis Popper, Pitt’s
in-house legal counsel conducting
the inquiry, will make a
recommendation to Pitt
administrators in charge of the
Campus Police as to what, if any,
disciplinary action should be
taken.

“There are allegations and
counter-allegations involving a
number of people in the public
safety department which we have
been looking into for about a
week and a half now,” Popper
said. '

“We really do not know if there
is truth to any of these allegations,”
he said. R

Popper has retained former U. S.
Attorney Robert Cindrich, now a
lawyer in private practice, to assist
him in conducting inquiry
interviews with members of Pitt's
Public Safety Department
involved in the allegations.

Female employees have said
that “language around the job is
too loose and offensive, and
there’s a general sense female
officers are not treated right,”

Cindrich said in a PittsbwgbPress

article on Sept. 22.

Promotions “are a big thing,”
Cindrich said. “[Brennan] put in
a new way and there are people
who don’t think it's fair.”

“lBrennanl definitely has a
faction of detractors; he also has
a camp of supporters who think

Public Safety director focus of internal investigation

he has made improvements to
update and modernize the
department, so I think it’s still
way too early to know what all is
going on," Cindrich said.
Cindrich refused to comment
for The Pitt News because,
Cindrich claimed, he was
misquoted in Friday’s Press article.
“We are in the middle of the
investigation at this time,” said
Popper, “and I don’t really know
what will happen tomorrow.”
Popper would not comment

on the specifics of the allegations. A

However, he said he “does not
recall” being made aware of any
allegations stemming from
Brennan’s new process of
awarding promotions.

However, he added, “I, again,
really don’t wish to talk about
any specifics of the allegations at
this time.”

Popper emphasized that he and
Cindrich “are going through with
the investigation as quickly as
possible,” because, he said,
“something like this can be

debilitating to a department.”

While the investigation is under
way, Popper said, the Department
of Public Safety will continue to

operate according to its normal L

procedures.

“Director Brennan will
absolutely be continuing in all
his duties [while the investigation

’ continuesl,” Popper said. ’

Popper said he has “complete
conﬁdence” that everyone in the
public safety‘ department will
conduct themselves in the proper
manner for the duration of the
investigation and until university
administrators decide on the next
course of action.

Students’ reactions to cleaning suite bathrooms varied

Sharon Romanovich
For The Pitt News

Maid service to Bruce,
Brackenridge, McCormick ‘and
Amos Halls has been cut due to
its inefficiency and the scheduling

conﬂicts it had caused, according .

to Bob Robinson, associate

director of support services.
“We made inspections

periodically and found the service

_[cleaning bathrooms weekly]

ineffective,” said Robinson. “Also,
we’re only talking about four
maids [one per building]. This
frees them up to do the big
projects they didn't have the time
to do before.”

These “big projects” include
shampooing carpets and
thoroughly cleaning the walls.
“Thebuildings are occupied all
year, and in the past, we didn’t
have people to. do [these things]
all the time,” said Robinson. \

Group oﬂers freshmen
leozdersbip training

Byjacinta M. Dvorak
For The Pitt News

The Emerging Leadership
Organization, a group formed to
train the future student leaders of
the University of Pittsburgh, is
ready for Pitt's class of 1993.

Joyce Giangarlo, associate
director of activities, said, “This
program is dedicated to training
underclassmen with leadership
and communicative skills. It also
is geared to show the individual
his or her own personal strengths

«and weaknesses. We then try to

compensate for their
weaknesses.”
Invitations to join the

‘Q organization were sent in August

to all members of the class of
1993. The first 200 students to
respond comprise the group. A
1‘ 20 fee was charged to cover the
cost of the program course book,
with any other costs for the

{programs activities funded by

' the student activities fund.

Giangarlo stated, “Some of the

1 people we see as freshmen in this

program go on to be leaders in
other clubs throughout the
university. The differences we
see as the students grow from
freshmen to seniors is incredible.
These same people grow and
move on to better things.”

The organization meets every
Wednesday from 6 to 8 p.m.
Members are split up into smaller
groups of 15, each of which is led
by a graduate student. “Some
graduate students have gotten
their Ph.D.s and still come back
to participate in the program.
They ﬁnd it very worthwhile,”
said Giangarlo. “Graduate
students have even gone through
the program and have come back
to work with freshmen, which
says a lot.”

Each individual group works
as a team on a project that has a
theme. At the end of the year,

See Leaders, page 3

To access these services, one
needs to fill out a maintenance
request form. The maids are now
also able to clean the lobbies and

lounges more effectively. Bob

Robinson said this is “reallocating

our human resources better. [This] .

allows more things to get done

for the overall population. We
/ are not the only school who has

done this. Rutgers, for example,
has done this, as well as a few
other schools.”

Robinson also mentioned there
were scheduling conflicts
between the ‘ maids and the
residents. For example, the maid
would come when someone was
showering for class, and be told
to come back later.

Robinson said that the feedback
his ofﬁce hasbeen getting from
students has been “not bad. There
are a lot of people who like it,
because it no longer interferes
with scheduling.”

John Thirkell, a resident in
Brackenridge, agrees. “It hasn’t
caused any problems. They had
a good reason for [Cutting the
service]."

Brian Snyder, another
Brackenridge resident, also
agrees. “Frankly, I don’t see what
has to be cleaned. If I yak in the
bathroom, I clean it up right then.
I don’t have any problems with
it" 1 .

The first meeting of the Black

Black Dialogue of the Year,” was
held Tuesday night in the William
Pitt Union Ballroom.

According to Marta Effinger, a
member of the society's Political
Action Committee, “It was our
beginning of the year meeting to
gather and discuss issues.”

Terry T innen, the organizer of

the event, felt that the response

was good, but not for the right

Though the main idea behind
the meeting was to present the

Corey Nelson, a senior in Bruce
Hall, said, “At least they are giving
us supplies with which to clean
the bathroom. Otherwise, I'd be
upset. But it hasn’t caused any
problems. My roommates and I
have worked out a schedule, so
we each only have to clean [the
bathroom] once a month.”

There are also those residents
who are unhappy with the
situation. Lisa Layden, a senior in
Bruce Hall, said, “We don’t have
any lounges or lobbies to clean.

All [the maid] has to do is vacuum ’

the hallway once a week. So why
can’t she come clean our
bathrooms?”

Michelle Freed, another Bruce

C Hall resident, added, “We don’t

have time to do it, really, what

just a hassle.

African organization
no longer inactive

By Chantal Evans
For The Pitt News

The Pan African Association,
recently revived after a year of
inactivity, has reorganized to
promote awareness of African
culture and problems,
according to the former
president of the organization.

“Just because you wear a
turban does not necessarily
mean it’s African,” said Aliyu
Babangida, now a member of
the Pan African Association.
“Politically, the countries are a
mess." _

The last year the P.A.A. was
active’ prior to this academic
year was 1987-88. Babangida
said that in the past the P.A.A.
experienced problems with a

‘ lack of organization and
reluctance of its members to
share responsibilities within
the association.

“Everything was in limbo,"

. Babangida said.

To correct these ﬂaws, it
was decided that all members
must be active in every aspect

of the group. Babangida said A

that part of this goal will be
accomplished because there

. are fewer members -—- around
30, compared to the 70
registered members in 1987-
88.

“We are concentrating,"
Babangida said, “on fewer
members who are more
committed to the association.”

The members decided at
their last meeting that a list of

, problems.

all African students at the
University of Pittsburgh will
be compiled. However, the
P.A.A. is not just limited to
Pitt students of African
descent; the association
encourages anyone who
shares its beliefs and goals to
get involved.

Babangida, who was the
president of the P.A.A. during
1987-88, said the programs
intended to promote public
awareness regarding their
activities are divided into three
categories —— cultural,
educational, and political. In
the past, guest speakers were
invited for demonstrations and
lectures, mainly focusing on
cultural activities. Babangida
said that the organization
plans to continue this practice.

Although the P.A.A. seems
to be running more smoothly,
it is suffering some ﬁnancial
According to
Babangida, “our sources of
revenue are not good at the
[present] time."

He expects the next meeting
to be within three weeks.
Officers will be elected some
time in October.

“Basically, my aspiration is
limited to mobilizing and
building a foundation,”
Babangida said. “I expect
members to become closer
through the organization and
have a better understanding’
of African culture.”

Pitt students uninformed

7 Two of the most_talked about and controversial issues

these days are homosexuality and AIDS.

Although theseissues have been -the subjectof numer-
ous talk shows‘, it seems that the public is still stuck back
in the Middle Ages as far as awareness of the facts are

I concerned.

Therecent killings of gay members of society (all in the
last year) + the stabbing of-a transvestite prostitute, the
death of a fifth-grade teacher suspected of being gay, the
discovery of a bisexual prostitute’s head in a trash bin and

most recently the beating death of a man in Schenley Park ’

-—i show that people are suffering from what some call
“homophobia.” » _ . A  '

VWhy do people feel so threatened by the sexuality of
another human being as to actually cause them bodily
harm? The only thing that makes any sense is that people
are afraid. They blame the homosexual community for the
current AIDS epidemic, and because they are uninformed

Y they feel thatthis disease is still mainly a “homosexual
 disease.” . V e

Well, it is not. According to a recent study by the

American College Health Association (ACHA) and the

Centers for Disease Control (CDC), one in every 500

college students -has been infected by HIV. “While this
'  number does’ not constitute enough reason for panic, it

most definitely deserves attention. _

‘The programs available at Pitt to erase the misconcep-
tions associated with this disease have ‘ been severely
lacking in both quantity and quality. They do exist;
however, they go unnoticed for the most part due to lack

of publicity.

The university can kill two birds with one stone. By

G introducing more programs to educate the public, we can

learn how to stop the spread of AIDS while simultane-
ously putting an end to the needless deaths of members
of our society due to their sexual preference. A
Hopefully, when people become-more informed, they
will no longer feel the urge to kill innocent people simply
because they do not understand them, and therefore fear
them. 

Guns are not dangerou

In regardto Bill Lester’s letter
of Sept. 25: -~

Yes, it is true. Guns do not kill
people; people do. Unfortunately,
it is the gun that creates the little
round holes that tend to bleed so
much. But still, people cling to
the idea that it is our God-given
right to carry weapons, [and]. any
dissenting view is un-American.
This, in a country where over 400
people weekly die by gunﬁre.

Before the stereotypes begin to
congeal, let me explain that I am

not some long-winded, 1ong- !
haired liberal with Dead stickers

on the back of my BMW. Surely,
all

0 le see the absurdi and

 

the inevitable terror that the
proliferation of readily available

‘weapons has caused.

~<.;f-7

Legalization is not the answer

It is easy to be swept away by
the sensational headlines telling
of the violence and crime caused
by the drug crisis, which has
escaped solution and worsened
in the‘ last decade. Thus, most
‘Americans support the warm
Columbia because it seems to
strike at the very heart of the
problem. ,

Beneath all the hype and

Y hysteria, the drug crisis is not so

easily solved. The heart of the
drug crisis‘: is in America, not
Columbia. Yet it is not simply the
result of the decline of the family,
the deterioration of values, or
even rampant inner-city poverty.
The crisis, unquestionably real,
has defied such one-dimension
analyses. . '
The failure of public policy
to solve this crisis has led to
frustration. That frustration has
led a growing number of policy
advocates, columnists and
armchair observers to propound
a different solution: legalization.
Supposedly, the case for
legalization is strong. Proponents
assert that crime would
immediately disappear as the
government regulated both the
market and the market price.
Addicts would no longer have to
steal and murder because drugs
would be cheap and legal. T
It- is certainly the easiest ‘
solution (the easiest solution to
solve any crime is to no longer
define it as such), but ironically,
legalization is no more the “magic
bullet” to social happiness than
drugs are. The case for legalization
is as ﬂimsy aslany other one-
dimensional policy initiative.

s, but the peop

in a time before crack wars, drive-
by shootings, serial killers and
(snipers in high places. Written by
a people armed with muskets
who lived in a world of oppres-
sive central governments l...l
How can a waiting period for a
handgunbe oppressive? In Ken-
tucky, one only has to fill out an
eight-question pamphlet before
purchasing an assault weapon.

‘Are you mentally unstable?”
"Well,.no. But I really do need”

It is probably true that the
market value of drugs would
decline. But how would the well-
armed gangs across the country,
who show a profound contempt

. for both law and life, feelif the
government tried to muscle in on’

their turf? Would they simply
concede their proﬁts to a greater
social good?

' Various authors have
suggested that it is inherent in

human nature to use drugs, thus _
. ments have shown a notorious

 

 

true freedom is equated with
legalization. This definition of
freedom is backwards. Human
nature is comprised of both good
and bad traits, and decent society
demands that humans curb their
evil ones (the lust for the power
to oppress others), to the benefit
of the good ones (art, creativity,
peace, etc).

If drugs became government
regulated, the government could
use this to increase its power. In
the past, this was achieved
through the control of food,

supplies and other basic human ,

needs. Even in modern America,
the ‘ government attempts to
control public opinion either by
squelching ,or d leaking vital
classified data. ,
\The nature of addiction is
that it is a physiological need.
The current crime epidemic owes
its nature to the fact that addicts
will do virtually anything to “get
a fix." Pimps and dealers are the

that MAC—10 machine pistol.”
And George Bush bans for-

eign—made weapons from our I

shores, much to the delight of
American gun manufacturers who
are now making a killing. I am
forced to applaud the irony that
the NRA members who scream
about their rights are the same
people who jeer “ﬂag burners”
and cheer censorship of authors
and artists. A kinder and gentler
nation, indeed.

Killing has [become] too easy,

modern slave masters,
withholding drugs if the addict
does not do as they order.

What. would happen if a

government that controlled the
drug supply decided to withhold
drugs to coerce the population of
addicts into something--— like
Voting a Certain way?

Why would a government
that is making moneyfrom drugs
eliminate a source of income by
rehabilitating addicts? Govern-

“best” for its populace- . I

V After the repeal of
Prohibition, alcohol consurnption
tripled and crime did not

Y magically disappear. The Maﬁa

simply changed its business to
cocaine and heroin distribution.
To quote the editor—in—chief

of U.S. News 6 World Report, 

“drugs are not bad because they
are illegal. They are illegal because
they are bad.” Legalization is not
wrong because , it condones
immoral behavior; it is wrong

because drugs are dangerous to

the individual and to society.
Drugs deceive the user into
believing that a “magic pill” for
happiness exists, and a society
made up of individuals who

— believe in such silver bullets will

not be able to solve its own
problems, especially complex
ones like poverty and crime.
Any solution to the drug
problem that does not take a
multifaceted approach is
superficial and similarly
"dangerous, and leads to the

drugs" is unwinnable.

le who buy them are

too accessible. Whether by hand-
gun or cruise missile, death is as

impersonal as phone sex. When_

shooting rampages are monthly
occurrences, when a gunshot
ends a family dispute, then kill-
ing has become too convenient.

:Q0¢ooOOoooo’Oooo0Ooit

These two films were the work
of two very different, very tal-
ented localgﬁlmmakers who are
both affiliated with the Oakland-
based Pittsburgh Filmmakers. Lee
Kann is an independent filmmaker
who also runs a Monroeville light-
ing company, and Craig McTurk
was a history major at Oberlin
College before becoming a pro-
duction assistant at WQED in
Pittsburgh. Their tales about their

entrance into the world of film A

are as different as their ultimate
ambitions involving their future
projects, but each shares the
genuine desire to make movies
for as long as possible.

Lee Kann started out by taping
Steelers and Penguins games, then
decided to move from television
to film by joining the Pittsburgh
Filmmakers for access to equip-
ment and film experience. Kann
now describes the Pittsburgh

' Filmmakers as a “regional outlet”

for regional funding. While
working on some features,
including The Prince of Pennsyl-
vania, Street Law and the made-
for-television movie Tbe Rescue
ofjessica Mclure, Mr. Kann made
The Barscene as a project for the
Pittsburgh Filmmakers’ Filmmak-
ing 11 class.

The film was shot in two days
with about $900 of Mr. Kann’s
money, and his costs for the two
excellent actors and three-man
crew were next to nothing be-
cause he used friends and class-

mates. He saw the premise of
The Bar Scene acted as a play
before modifying the idea to best
suit the project he had in mind.
When asked about the best
way to learn how to make mov-
ies, he’ll simply tell you, “trial and
error,” but admits that he also
reads a lot about filmmaking
which has helped him a great
deal. Like George Lucas and

Frankie Capri: One Man Band

unlike Steven Spielberg, Mr.
Kann’s favorite aspect ofﬁ1mmak-
ing is editing. He feels becoming
a proficient editor is important
before moving on to take the
positions of a producer or direc-
tor, and his ultimate goal is to
direct a feature-length film in
Hollywood, or even stay to make
one in Pittsburgh.

“You have to play the Holly-

wood game to make Hollywood
films,” he says. “You have to
know your place, you have to be
well liked, you have to stay on

the good side of everybody, you C

have to expect nothing and take
nothing for granted. Be very
cautious; you can be optimistic,
but you have to be realistic. You
learn the game as you play it.” Mr.

THE 1=-rrr NEWS, Thursday, September 28, 1989 1 9

By Tim Azinger
Showcase Editor

True—to-form punk rock has
fallen by the wayside amidst
heaps of thrash metal and cross-
over, and it seems like centuries
have passed since anything
closely resembling the early “anal-
retentive” punk style has been
dedicated to vinyl.

The Pagans just happen to be
one such band in this vein that
flourished in the '70s, but they
were cast by the wayside years
ago in favor of the more
compromising bands that used
the Pagans as a role model. It was
feared that the Pagans would be
shrouded in obscurity forever,
but some evil phenomenon has
awakened the thudding scourge
once again.

Most of the Pagans’ material
has been scarfed up by dedicated
fans and collectors, so copies of

Album (1983), as well as a few
earlier singles, are hard to come

by.

Although it is mere speculation ’

Kann describes the employment
in Pittsburgh features as being
“very closed” and getting a job
usually comes down to both who
you know and what you know.

The Bar Scene was submitted
for review to the Mid Atlantic
Region for the National Endow-
ment of the Arts. According to Mr.
Kann, those who hand out the

funding usually base their opin-g

ion more on the sample work
sent than the proposed idea and
budget.

Mr. Kann learned that “apply—
ing for a grant could be a class in

itself,” but nevertheless won the
NEA funding that will take care of
approximately one-third of his
next project's budget. He is al-
ready shooting this new ﬁlm,
which is to be about the music of
Pittsburgh. Although he often
works for other ﬁlmmakers, it is
apparent that he is determined
and independent. “I’ll continue
to make my own ﬁlms whether
I’m working for someone or not.”

“I met him about a year ago. A
couple of friends of mine tipped
me off about this guy  so Iwent
down and saw him, and I in-

stantly knew I wanted to do a
project with him," says Craig
McTurk, ﬁlmmaker of Frankie
Capri, OneMan Band: Music for
All Occasions.

McTurk then met Kathy DeSio,
who had visions of the documen-
_tary’s subject achieving greatness
in Las Vegas and New Jersey.
Frankie Capri, the subject of the
film, reportedly doesn't like to
refer to her as his manager, but
according to McTurk, she helps
him manage his business affairs
and remains a diehard Capri
“groupie.” These two people were
the main subjects of the film, a

Frankie Capri is indeed a one

choruses of mechanized or stuffed ,

animals. He plays at weddings,
parties, V.F.W. bashes and the
Liberty Bell Lounge every Friday

79th Annual Exhibition: Assoc. Artists of Pittsburgh

By Heather N eisworth
For The Pitt News

“I never wanted to be a painter.
I wanted to be a tap dancer.”

But painting is what Andy
Warhol excelled in by bringing
his form of pop art into the

_ mainstream. He achieved world— 1

wide fame in New York City but
received his first prominent rec-
ognition here in Pittsburgh.

The organization that can claim
Warhol, and impressionist Mary
Cassat, as some of its famous
alumni is still recognizing and
rewarding local artists today. This
takes place at the Associated
Artists of Pittsburgh’s 79th annual
exhibition at The Carnegie Mu-
seum.

The Associated Artists organi-
zation was formed in 1910 to
“foster the love of the visual arts.”
Holding its first exhibition in the
Pittsburgh Opera House, it was
moved the following year to the
Carnegie. ‘

This show is special, for only
an elite group of artists may even
submit work to be judged. These
people must already be accepted
into the Artists Association by
having their work examined and

approved by a panel during one

of the two critiquing periods each
year. ,

Anna Marie Snisky, executive
director of the associates, also feels
it is unique, “because it is an exhibi-
tion of new and fresh works that
have never been viewed before.”

This year, 129 pieces of art rang-
ing from futuristic-looking hardwood
furniture to a collage of tape and
Burger King napkins are presented.
And although a definitive Pittsburgh
style isn't prevalent, many works do
depict local scenes such as Kenny-

wood Park, the Fort Pitt Bridge and 1

the museum itself.

But a feeling of subdued ques-
tioning, concerning society’s pres-
ent norms, does seem to permeate
the show. This is especially shown
in William D. Wades “YTV” in which
a black and white photo of a TV is
on a country road enframed with
the words WHY? around it, while
A..M. Shur’s “Brownstone Party," in
morbid earthtones, reveals two
businessmen, one of whom has a
leash around the other. _

Special mention must also be given
to Charles Gibbons whose two
entries present a look at students in
Tiananmen Square. They distinc-

tively show the fear and uncertainty

students in China faced. Such a

she continued, "I have to go upstairs, and while I'm
gone I don't want you stick any of these green beans

_you,” she said as she walked out of the kitchen.

Johnny kept thinking about what his

be kind of funny to see someone put green beans up

II

By Dmitri Ragano
Assistant Showcase Editor

Someone once told me that the
problem with most Kurt Vonnegut
novels is that the jacket
descriptions are usually better
than the books themselves. ‘The
Navigator,” an award-winning
time-travel ﬂick from New
Zealand, suffers this fate: it’s a
great synopsis and a
disappointing film.

We start in a bleak medieval
town, where a young boy named

Griffin is having strange visions. ,

His adult brother Connor returns
from a trip abroad with newsthat
the plague is coming. As the
community prepares for doom,
Griffin reveals his dreams. Led by
this visionary child, four villagers
make a pilgrimage to twentieth
century New Zealand in hopes of
saving themselves.

Director Stephen Ward has an
eye for dazzling visuals. The early
scenes are full of stark Gothic,
“Seventh Seal”-type imagery.
Some scenes are done in straight
black and white, some have a
little color splashed in.

Ward seems to be greatly
inﬂuenced by fantasy director
Terry Gilliam (“Time Bandits,”
“Brazil”). When the pilgrims
journey into the future, the film
becomes a total “Brazil”—style
assault on the senses. The editing’s
extremely tight, and we get

bombarded with weird, gorgeous
images that come and go in a
flash. The stereo sound’s terrific;
in adventure scenes, it hums and

blares as if the theater is in a wind
tunnel.

Clearly, all this heavy artillery
is supposed to create some
suspense or exhilaration or
something. “The Navigator”
doesn’t succeed with any of these.

As the movie rushes by, we
know we’re supposed to be
amazed bysomething, but we
haven't the slightest idea what.

The actors seemed tired and

uncertain; they’re being asked to
look astonished in every scene.
Only visually does this film
create the sense of wonder that it
strives for. No one loves a good
fantasy film more than me, but
this has been a banner year for
pathetic exercises in hardware
(check out “The Abyss” and

“Baron Von Munchausen” if you
have hard—earned money to
blow).

“The Navigator” won six
Australian Oscars, prizes at ﬁlm
festivals all over Europe and rave
reviews in the States. Apparently
I'm in the minority when I say it’s
a mediocre, unmemorable film.

— celebrates Capri’s work.

* Before the project, he had been
shooting “real lame” movies with
his father’s Super-8 camera as a
kid, taking acting classes at the

V Pittsburgh Filmmakers and a

summer production workshop at
New_Yo'rk University. His movies
are more personally than profit

Although his ultimate goal is
“to have a project pay for itself,”
McTurk just wants to keep doing
“more little projects where I fo-
cus on somebody who’s ex-
tremely offbeat or has something
different to offer.” He isn't en-
chanted much with the idea of
working within the Hollywood
system, and stresses the impor-
tance of his independence. “Many
successful directors have always
worked outside the system and
I’m not sure that’s for me,” he

says. “The directors I admire most
are the indies [independent
filmmakers]... like Jonathan
Demme, John Sayles, Robert
Townsend.”

“Pittsburgh is a good place tc
work your way up,” says McTurk,
“but the cruel reality is that you
have to put out some of your own
money before you’re able to do
something that would be consid-
ered ‘good enough’ to get a grant;
with. There’s no easy way off
doing it.” '

He is currently pursuing the
idea of making another offbeat
documentary, either about a Kit-
taning woman who has agora-
phobia and hasn’t left her house
for 15 years, or a film that would
follow the local motorcycle club
circuit, which he says he ‘‘wouldn’t
want to do without their con-
sent.” ,

McTurk is also thinking about

‘going to graduate school for

filmmaking. “I’d tend more to-
wards a school like NYU rather

    

oriented. ,

Pitt must overcome ‘Major’ problem to topple WV! 1

By Chris Kuzneski
Staff Writer

When pre—season football magazines
hit the newsstands this summer, many of
them anticipated the upcoming game
between Pitt and West Virginia. Not only
would the 82nd rendition of “the Backyard
Brawl” be important to national rankings,
but an exciting duel between two
outstanding quarterbacks would be staged
as well.

The prognosticators were right, sort
of. 7

This Saturday’s game will feature the
9th—ranked Mountaineers and the 10th—
ranked Panthers in a game of national
importance. It will also feature a duel
between two of the country’s best
quarterbacks. Darnell Dickerson, however,

won’t be participating.
Instead, Pitt will confront Major Harris
and- 60,000 extras from the movie

i “Deliverance,” with a poised newcomer at

the quarterback position, Alex Van Pelt.
Alex /an Pelt? Isn ’t he the third—string

redshirt freshman who earned a starting

job by simplystaying academically eligible?
You mean, hes good?

Very good. After last Saturday’s game
against Syracuse, Van Pelt was named
ECAC player of the week, and dubbeda
legitimate Heisman Trophy candidate by
ESPN announcer Kevin Kiley. And if Van
Pelt’s spectacular playing continues, a
national audience will witness a ‘ great
duel between two superior quarterbacks———
or will they? ’

“I don’t see it as a quarterback duel,”
said Van Pelt. “My challenge is their
defense, and our defense’s challenge is

Major Harris. I don’t feel like I’m going
against Major. I’m going against their

defense. ”

West Virginia’s defense is led by outside
linebacker. Renaldo Turnbull and inside
linebacker Chris Haering, two of the top
players in the East. It is this type of talent
that allows West Virginia to dictate its own
style of play.

When asked whether he felt West
Virginia would change its defensive game
plan in order to stop Van Pelt’s accurate
passing game, Coach Mike Gottfried
replied, “West Virginia won all of their
games [regular season] last year and so far
this year as well. I don’t expect to see
many changes.”

If that is the case, the Panthers and
Alex Van Pelt could‘ be in for a big
statistical day because even West Virginia
coach Don Nehlen admits he lacks a

superior pass defense. “We’ve given up a
lot of yardage, but haven’t givenup too
many points. We’ve been able to stop the
run decently, but people have hurt us with
the passing game.”

As far as Pitt defensive back Robert
Bradley is concerned, passing will decide
the game. It is West Virginia’s quarterback
Major Harris, however, and not Pitt’s Alex
Van Pelt that Bradley worries about.

“Once Major starts scrambling, it’s
basketball time. You have to play basketball
defense with the receivers, and follow
them all over the field.”

To make matters worse for the Panthers,
the Mountaineers are blessed with an

abundance of talented receivers, including 1

Reggie Rembert, a receiver that many pro
scouts consider the best in theland.
“You have to play the ball with

an All—American is always tough,
even more so when he is seven

“lRembertl is tough,” said
Bradley. “And being that he's 6
feet 6 inches and I’m only 5 feet
11 inches, there’s definitely a
height advantage. I’ll just have
to be aggressive, play the '-ball
and use my vertical leap to try to

Bradley will share the duties

of hawking Rembert withfellow
defensive backs Hampton,
Riddick, Steve Israel, Dan
Crossman, Marcus Washington,
Barry Threats and Doug Hetzler.
He is part of Pitt head coach
Mike Gottfried’s rotating “I” and
“LA” defensive scheme.

Although Rembert is probably
the most dangerous wide
receiver in the country, Bradley

‘and his teammates know that
the West Virginia offense lives "
and dies on the Major. Keeping
Harris from making big plays
will be important in sending the
10th-ranked ‘Eers to their first
loss. Easier said than done.

“Harris is a great quarterback,”
said Bradley, who co-captains
the Panthers, along with
Crossman and offensive tackle
Roman Matusz. “If we can shut
him down ‘on the option and
take away the big play, we’ll
beat them. ’

“We’ve been working on [the
optionlsince spring, fall, every
single day.vA day doesn’t go by
without us working on the
option. We stopped Syracuse’s
option and we’re prepared for
West Virginia’s.” .

Speaking of Syracuse, Bradle
was a defensive mainstay for
the Panthers, making four tackles
and
breaking up one Bill Scharr pass.
He also recovered Ousmane
Bary’s fumble of a first quarter

0 Shocker NFL stat of the week:
At this very point in time, both
the Miami Dolphins and the
Pittsburgh Steelers have more total
sacks than the Buffalo Bills. Miami,
agteam usually as sackless as
Santa Claus injuly, has 15 already,
while the pass-rushless Steelers
have six. The Bills, with Cornelius
Bennett and Bruce Smith and the

guys, only have five.
-No hype here — Pitt Panther

 

quarterback Alex Van Pelt, he of
only-redshirt- freshman-playing
status, is the best to play the
position at the school since Dan
Marino. Van Pelt works the

sidelines as sharp as anyone in the
country, and has the coolness of a
fifth—year senior. His quarterback
rating of 176.0 is third—best in the
nation, while completing S1 of his
67 passing attempts. Unbelievable.

-Quietly, Bret Saberhagen ol
the Kansas City Royals is having
the best season of any pitcher in
the major leagues. His 22-6 record,
2.27 ERA and 11 complete games
are all the best in baseball, while
his 176 strikeouts aren’t all that
shabby either. Should win the Cy

Young Award.

Pittsburgh at Detroit: Detroit

Steelers , looked like a great
football team. Rodney Peete

Sanders will get 100+, and I don’t
think the Steelers are for real yet.
Lions. .

Atlanta at Green Bay: Both of
these teams are improving also,
but they’ve been bad for. so long
it’s hard to say what will happen.
Green Bay, I suppose.

Cincinnati at Kansas City:
The Chiefs let me down last week
by losing to San Diego. If a team

can’t beat the Chargers, they’re '

not going to beat Cincinnati.
Denver at Cleveland: Denver

is resurging, while the Browns

keep on plugging away. Bernie

/ "will lead Cleveland to a win.

Indianapolis at, New York

Jets: Both of these teams are,

close to impossible to ﬁgure out.

The Jets score a lot, but give up a
lot. The Colts don’t score a lot,
but don’t give up a lot. Points are
being scored at a record pace this
year, so I'm going with the Jets,
who know how to score.
Miami at Houston: Houston
has given up, by far, the most
points in the NFL, and we all
know that Marino can score

almost at will. However, I think ‘

this is the week the Oilers’ defense
won’t be so slippery. Take
Houston. '

New England at Buffalo:
Buffalo scored seven points more
last week than the Pats have all
year. Therefore, it’s easy—-« take
the Bills over the hapless New
Englanders.

WashingtonatNewOrleans:
What the heck happened to the
Saints? They were supposed to
be the best team in the NFC two
years ago. Now, as last week’s
loss to Tampa Bay proves, they
stink. Take the ‘Skins, who still
know how to play.

Tampa Bay at Minnesota: I’m
not giving up on the Vikes just
because of one embarrassing
week. Vikings all the way.

San Diego at Phoenix: The-

battle of mediocrity. I hate picking

mediocre teams; be bad or good,

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, September 28, 1989

Am I destined to go 7-6 every
week for the rest of the season?
I’ll attempt to upgrade my record
by several games this week.

Pittsburgh at Detroit: Tough
one to call. I can’t ﬁgure the
Steelers out for my life, but then
again, Detroit is not a model of
consistency either. Steelers in an
upset.

Atlanta at Green Bay: Two 

teams deﬁnitely on the upswing.
Give it to the Pack.

Cincinnati at Kansas City:
Money in the bank. Cincy, big
time.

Denver

at Cleveland:

Cleveland looked horrible against -

the Bengals on Monday night,‘,,.,,
but Eric Metcalf and Bernie will " "

lead the Browns to victory this
week. K

Indianapolis at NY Jets: The
Jets can put the points on the
board, but are lacking in defense.
I’ll go with the Jets offense by a
touchdown.

Miami at Houston: Another

tough one. Marino is ﬁring T Ds 
like there’s no tomorrow, but "' P

Moon and Co. are desperately
due for a win. Take Houston.

Rembert,” said Bradley. “He’s 6
feet 6 inches and I’m 5 feet 11
inches. There’s deﬁnitely a height
advantage. I’ll just have to use my
vertical leap and try to knock the
ball down.”

If the Panthers are successful
in shutting down West Virginia’s
explosive passing game, the next
problem will be trying to contain
the Mountaineers’ powerful
option attack.

Junior defensive tackle Marc

Spindler claims, “Major Harris runs ‘

the optiona lot better than that

. guy [QB Bill Scharr] from Syracuse

did, but if we can shut him down
we’ll do OK.” I

Coach Gottfried agrees with
his defensive tackle’s assessment,
and in “ order to stop the

I Mountaineers’ option, Gottfried

feels the Panthers must constantly

. attack the opponents with fresh

defensive linemen. In order to
accomplish this, Gottfried will
once again utilize a platoon
system with his ﬁrst and second
defensive units, a system that
Gottfried likes to refer to as
“defense 1 and 1A.’’ '

West Virginia coach Don,

Nehlen admits he has never
coached against this type of
defensive system, but says he
knows how to prepare for it. “I’ll
go to church more."

In a game that appears as
evenly matched as this, prayers
could make the difference.

Panther Notes: In an ironic
twist, both starting quarterbacks
grew up in the opposition’s
backyard. Major Harris is a native

In speaking of Harris, Bradley
referred to a play he and his
teammates witnessed while
watching the West Virginia/
Louisville game films. Harris is
scrambling for his life and, just as

a Louisville defensive player is ’

throwing him to the turf, he ,
unleashes a strike to Rernbert for
a touchdown. Bradley thinks
Harris’ scrambling could turn this
football game into another sport
for the Panther defensive corps.

“Once he starts scrambling, it’s
basketball time," he said. “You
have to play basketball with the
receivers. Just follow them all
around the field and try to hold
coverage as
possible.” 0

He expects a carbon copy of
last week’s Syracuse game ——'—
intense and aggressive. After all,
they don’t call this the “backyard
brawl” for nothing.

Pittsburgh at Detroit: There ’s
something fishy about that
Steelers victory last week. How
can a team improve so much so
quickly? I’m going with the Lions;
they’re about due for a win.

Atlanta at Green Bay: I’ll have
to give this one to the Packers.
Despite their mediocre record,
they’ve been putting a lot of
points on the board.

Cincinnati at Kansas City:

This is an easy one. Bengals will
win big.

Denver at Cleveland: The

Browns just came off a
disappointing loss on Monday
night, while the Broncos are
undefeated. I'll take Cleveland
ontheir home field advantage.
Indianapolis at NY Jets:

Houston at Miami: The
Oilers deserve a win after last

struggle. Miami doesn’t-stand a

New England at Buffalo: W

those Patriots: they’re pretty lame.
The Bills, on the other hand, are
already looking like a shoo—in as
AFC East division champ. I'm
telling you this now in case they

Now some college picks by Pitt
News staff sportswriter Geoff
Moskowitz.

Pitt 31, WVU 27.

The truth is that West Virginia
has no business being favored by
three" points. I don’t care if the
game is in Morgantown, or
anywhere else for that matter.
The Panthers will not only cover,
they will win by three or more.

Buffaloes 35, Huskies 20.

If Pitt weren’t playing West
Virginia, Colorado vs. Washington
would be the game of the week.
In the wake of former Colorado
quarterback Sal Aunese’s death,
the Buffaloes are on a mission.
Besides that, they are a better
team than the Huskies. The line is
even, but I like Colorado by a
bunch.

Texas 21, PSU 17.

You sayJOE-PA, I say THETIC.
Unlike Pitt, Penn State did make
many preseason polls, in the Top
10, no less. This was ‘based
primarily on the facts that Blair
“Savior” Thomas was returning,
and Paterno’s teams fare well
after mediocre seasons. Thomas-
ranks 14th in the nation for

rushing, and State has struggled‘

with the likes of Virginia and
Boston College.
