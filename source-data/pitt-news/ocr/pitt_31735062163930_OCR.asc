SOME or THE ND the‘. Depaquale

  

contracting ﬁrm has refused to sell to the

Oakland Corporation.

UNIVERSITY‘ or PITTSBURGH

 Contractor Refuses to $611  
 Land to OaklandCorporation

By _ DEVRA, LEE ‘DAVIS

The DePasquale Company,
a, general contracting ﬁrm
owning land needed for the
Panther Hollow Project, has
stalled plans for the project
by. refusing to sell the prop-
erty to the Oakland Corpora-
tion.

‘According to Fred DePas-
quales, a spokesman for the
hesitant ﬁrm, “we will never
sell a parcel of land —.which is
not going to be developed.”

The conﬂict, claims DePas-
quale, has nothing to do with
ﬁnance. It is all a matter of
development. ' I

O a k C o r p president Fred

Smith, on the other hand,
stated early ‘Monday that the
construction ﬁrm is asking
one million dollars for the 2.4
acres they own and that the
OakCorp is not prepared to
go that high for the acquisi-
tion. According ‘to Mr. Nor-
walk of the OakCorp, this is

the only difference of opinion

with "the DePasquales.‘ “He
(DePasquale) vindicated  .
his price was about ten dol-
lars a square. foot for 103,000
square feet” —— roughly one
million dollars.

DePasquale, to the con-
trary, insists that “an ask-
ing price was never deliv-

ered,” and terms Norwalk’s
estimate .“eroneou_s.” _

The Oakland Corporation
and the DePasquales have
been . working on. negotia-
tions for the sale of the prop-
erty since July, 1963. DePas-
quale explained that the .dif-

ﬁculty arose because his
company was
negotiating for a cash set-
tlement, but also for con-
tracts. He is not convinced
that the OakCorp is in any

Policy Office Announces
Change in 17-Credit Limit

The Officeof Policy Planning
and Co-ordination has revised its
statement of last month concern-
ing the 17 - credit 1 i m i t under
September's ﬂat tuition system.

After a rush of conﬂicts during
the first 10 days of fall pre-regis-
tration, assistant chancellor of pol-
icy planning Edison Montgomery
decided a deﬁnition was needed of
academic credits and of who falls
under the policy. V

The original policy ‘stated that
no student with under a 2.5 QPA
could register for over 17 aca-
demic credits under the ﬂat fee
of $700. Exceptions could be made
only through application of “good
and suﬂicient justification” to the
dean of the particular school.

Under the revision, academic
credits is deﬁned as excluding
courses in Air Science, Military
Science, compulsory physical edu-

~cation, and certain engineering

seminars, as speciﬁed in the orig-
inal tuition statement.
‘ his ielimlnates any necessity

‘guage can still ﬁnish

   

for a student. going nine terms.
For instance, a student losing
eight credits toward graduation
because he takes a beginning lan-
in eight
terms‘ with under 17 academic
credits a term as deﬁned in the
revision’.

Another confusion inthe orig-
inal statement involved no spe-
ciﬁcation as to what trimester
deﬁned his QPA if he wished
to petition his dean for a pro-
gram of over 17 credits.

The revision calls for the cum-
ulative average of the student as
of pre-registration. The petition
can be for any program which
exceeds 17 academic credits to a
maximum of 20 credits, which-
ever is greater.

Finally, the revision adds that
any student entering his last two
terms at the University can peti-
tion for excess credits as long
as his QPA is “of good academic
standing" i.e. a cumulative aver-

ageroi 2.0;, . . ~ . .~

Pinneo Resigns; Effective July 31  

By JOSIE GROSSMAN

Director of admissions Everard
K. Pinneo has submitted his resig-
nation to the University eﬁective
July 31. _

Waiving any comment on his
reasons for leaving, Pinneo stated

‘only that he would like to try

work in a ﬁeld other than admis-
sions. He was not at liberty to say
where he would be going because
nothing had been ﬁnalized.

.The admissions head succeeded
Dr. Bernard Adams in August,
1960 when Dr. Adams was named
special assistant to the Chancellor.
Pinneo had previously served as
director of admissions at Renes-
selar Polytechnic Institute.

Formed Admission Policy
His 1960 appointment included
assisting graduate and profession-
al school deansto develop admis-
sion policies, as well as his under-
graduate concentration. He also
served on the staff of Dr. John
Geise, assistant chancellor for stu-
dent aﬁfairs at the time.
He squelched the rumor that

hope that standards will stay the
same or perhaps even go up.

“Rumors can get pretty sub-
stantially distorted,” he remarked.

Citing the larger high school
graduating classes this year, Pin-
neo explained that he could not
determine any proportionate in-
crease in the college freshman
class until the deadline for accept-
ances.

Cities Standards

Present standards average mid-
dle 500’s for College Board Scores,
with 545 in verbal and 570 in the
math section. Sixty-three per cent
of the present freshman class are
from the top ﬁfth of their grad-
uating class. Twenty-four per cent

. are from the second ﬁfth.

“I don’t anticipate any sub-
stantial change for the class in
the fall,” Pinneo concluded.

When asked about the stand-

ards for the regional campuses,
Pinneo explained -that they have
their own admission -standards
and his office is not responsible I
for them.

admirable job during four of its roughest years in its change from an urban to an inter-
national institution. But now, he says, he’d like to try a ﬁeld other than admissions,
and we can’t‘ say that we blame him. '

A The position of the Admissions Ofﬁce in this institution is a ticklish one. It has
to achieve two goals the Chancellor has outlined in his plans for expansion which,
when you put them side by side, seem almost to conﬂict.

On the one hand, the Chancellor wants ivy climbing the Cathedral. He wants
higher academic quality, evidenced by an_ increase in doctorates among the staff,
higher student quality, an increase in honors programs, and higher athletic prestige
to insure our rank some day in the top ten. ,

Tuition increases and gifts have promoted our growth in the areas of academics
and physical plant. Sufficient student aid has attracted. better students and athletes.

But at the same time, the Chancellor has committed himself to serve Alle-
gheny County and the state, accepting larger classes to build as well as to serve, and
this may well contradict his goal of quality. I

For in order to ﬁll an increased quota as well as the Athletic Department’s de-
mands for top athletes, the Admissions Ofﬁce may be put under enough pressure to
lower its standards. With the University’s present academic standing and, to some,

 

formidable tuition costs, it is not yet in a sought-after position. So it may have to

compromise its ideals at present ‘to insure a future. _

Certainly Mr. Pineo’s successor is not in an enviable position. Although the ad-
mission practices of the regional campuses are notpresently "under the jurisdiction
of the Oakland campus, a problem may ‘arise when students admitted under what may
be a lower standard at a regional campus——— again to insure ‘ﬁlling quotas —— decide
to ﬁnish their education here. Similarly the Athletic Department mayxinduce pressure

Damn The Yankees and Full Speed Ahead. 

 I It Was Good Enough for Moses

For those of you who are deeply troub-
I led by the ebbing morality of our younger
generation, may I humbly refer to your at-
tention the recent goings on in the "mid-
western burg of Ionia, Michigan. In that
town, within the past week, the old bug—a—
boo Satan has been dealt a staggering, kick
in the sweetbreads through the heroic ef-
forts of the local diviner, one Reverend
Raymond Bierlein by name. ,
Under the motton “Let’s Keep Our
Senior Class Play Clean,-” the good Rever-
end attacked the licentious dance of a 16-
' ' year-old Lola in the local high school pro-
duction of the musical “Damn Yankees.”
According to the UPI story which appeared
in Friday’s edition of The Pittsburgh Press
he condemned the play in a sermon to his
congregation, and appeared before the
school board with his request that the
«dance be stricken from the production and
that in the future all student plays “should
. be subject to censoring” by the board and
faculty. The dance, he contended, “was
clearly salacious and immoral.

“An inexcusable act of arrogance and

effrontery on the part of the director,”

‘ croaked the Reverend.

Although he did not succeed in having.
’the entire dance deleted, he did manage
to have the part cut out where Lola (the
16-year-old variety) shimmies down into
the audience and entices the middle-aged
«fathers of her school mates to desert their
hum-drum existences and join ,her in a
wild life of carefree abandon and endless
frivolity.

° If I promise never to breathe a word of
it to the bishop, Ray — I feel that I may
address the good Reverend by his first
name, for I also am deeply concerned with
the morality of youth — may I tell you
‘ that I ﬁnd it very hard to believe that any
dance by any 16-year-old, no matter how
voluptuously endowed, could induce me to
abandon my life ‘of celibacy and complete
abstinence from all vices of the ﬂesh. ‘ .

Oh! I must admit, Ray old buddy, that
every’ once in a while I do enjoy a sip of
brandy before dinner, and two or three
times during my 21-odd years I have savor-
ed a few gulps of tobacco fumes. But this

matter of the dance is quite another story. —

she didn’t really destroy anyone’s virtue or -

ciple of the thing that counts. _ _
We dmusn’t permit our children to ob-
tain that evil “mature” outlook ‘on moral
questions which our parents so laboriously
sheltered us from. The world would indeed
be a ﬁner place to live in ifiwe could all re-

which you and I are trying so desperately

Miss Kellams Praised
By Graduate Student

‘ Editor, Thef'Pit't News: '

Your editorial, “Oh! Come Now, Freda”. (April I), has struck me

in severalways. The .title made me ‘curious; the -reading left be
ﬂabbergasted. Only after reﬂection that The PM News had been
awarded several honors because of outstanding quality as a. collegiate
newspaper did I realize that I was not "reading, a bad junior high
school leaﬂet. '

5

Nevertheless, -I think I would do an injustice to the University

community by taking this editorial as representative of- their feelings.
I think it represents, rather, a group of people to be found both in and
outside _ the University.

That one has strange or "way out” ‘ideas on campus is only
healthy ‘provided that they are defended intelligently and ‘aban-
doned when proven untenable.‘ It is a ‘sign _of weakness and of
poor taste it one has to take refuge in the grand-daddy to
grandchild style of admonishment in order to present a view to
peopleof one’s own age. I

The other day I ‘had a discussion with an integrationist South-

erner who now found-himself defending the.South in the North, i.e.
in Pittsburgh. His point -was that he 'objected to the hypocrisy in the
North. Southerners deny the Negroes equal rights, but they express
their hostility in the open. Although one mayrregret these conditions,
they are at least honest, as opposed to the more subtle. -- but
equally as damaging -- discrimination in the North.

The hypocrisy in not recognizing this situation in the Pittsburgh

.-area permeates the editorial. The writer seems to be very anxious
to preserve his “ivory tower”, conception of a “neat little decent
world.” He is clearly shocked by the inroad that civil rights action so
close by has had upon his illusions. He tries to desegregate Freda and

, her activities from the University; calls upon “looking at things

I rationally for once” and is disturbed that Pittsburgh may be equated
with Birmingham, an apparently unfavorable comparison.

The writer, somehow, realizes that something should be done
against discrimination and he ‘puts all his faith, which seems
not much, in the “very efficient Human Relations Commission.”
He refuses to realize that the issues -— of which discrimination is _
only a part --ought to be the concern of every American indi-
vidual in the “here and now” situation. ‘It cannot be delegated to
some committee made up of ‘a few representatives of the com-
munity. ‘

The -editor,_ moreover, -contradicts himself by attacking a person

who drew the logical" conclusion of a maturing thinking process,‘ and

had the moral courage to throw herself into a more
than full day’s work to further the course she,‘ and
many with her, recognized as the ‘right one.

The character and courage to follow that course
of action to which independent intellectual thought
has. led should -be respected and highly valued
under all circumstances, irrespective of the issues.
It is both the purpose and the obligation of a true
university education to foster, and stimulate inde-

to -act accordingly; and to provide intellectual
‘leadership. This basic respect for human‘ dignity
is missing in the editorial. ‘

Of course, one can have doubts about whether
picketing actions are the most appropriate means
to achieve certain ends. I would like to remind
you that the labor movement in this country has ~
used this form of pressure successfully for a long
time, and is still -employing the strike as its most
powerful method of protest. (Did you ever hear
of the present railroad strike in Florida?)

The history,of’the Negro emancipation is full
of what one could call “talking sessions.” The
frustrations resulting from this approach have led
to the present, more effective, action patterns.

One always hears that the United States is a
free nation where everybody is entitled to his own
opinion and freedom of expression. This is mar-
velous. However, it follows also that there should
be somebodyto listen, in order to‘ incorporate chal-
lenging ideas after careful consideration and to do
some soul—searching continuously oneself ‘to pre-
vent preconceived notions from getting rusty and

~ World’s Fair ‘Program

‘ The highpoint of the tour was
to be the three day stay‘ in New
York when they sa_ng at the
? World’s Fair. The Glee Club pro-~
vided an entertaining program of
entertainment which varied from
2 “Adoramus Te Christe,” a Cath-
E olic liturgical song, and “Havenu
V Shalon Alcchem,” a ‘Hebrew num-
ber meaning “They -Wfsh You
Peace,” to the Negro. Spiritual,
“My Lord, Mhat -a Mornin’.”

That the World’s Fair per-
formances were not as success-
ful as they might have been,
was no fault of the Glee Club's-.l
A lack of organizations on the
part of the Fair, meant that at-
s o m e pavillions, microphones
and proper ampliﬁcation were
not present, and programs were
scheduled to be performed on
the outskirts of the fairgrounds.

The performance at the United
States pavilion went well, and
Radio Corporation of America
(RCA) later vidiotaped a Glee.
Club performance to be repeated
on color television in the RCA pa-
vilion over a Pe1‘i0d Of 3 few
weeks. ‘ .

Guest Performance

Another highlight of the World’s
Fair performance was the guest
appearance of Helen‘ Ruth Waite
who flew in from Pittsburgh to
sing “Buzzy” Walter’s arrange-
ment of “Romany Life” with the
Glee Club.

The William Pitt Debating
Union recently won debates with
Northwestern University and Cor-
nell University, 5-2, and 4-2.

The team of Thomas Zaucha
a n d b Martin ' Engels successfully
argued a g a i n s t Northwestern
University at various high schools
in‘New York and New Jersey on
the topic, “Resolved: That the
Federal government should guar-
antee an opportunity for higher
education to all qualiﬁed high
school graduates.” , ,_

Theodore Danielson and Rich-
ard Zirkle, debating publicly for
the ﬁrst time, argued that the
United States should withdraw
military support from South Viet-
nam. They debated against Cor-
nell University on April 30. On
April 21, Merrily Kodis and Don-
ald Kelley debated the Negative
of this resolution with Cornell.

Both the debates with Cornell
University were presented to
public high school audiences.

Only Golf Coach

F ails To Complain

_The coaches are complaining. Tennis coach Ben Pope is
pouting about lack of courts and players, Bobby Lewis says
his baseball team needshits and is ‘travel-weary. Track
coach Carl ‘Reeshas his usual «problem with a lack of depth.

The only coach we haven’t heard complain is the golf
coach. The reason is we don’t know who the golf coach is;
This is a sad admission from the sports editor of a news-
paper, but the whole situation has us‘
confused. Who is the golf coach?

Last year it was George-Under-
wood, or as he is known, “The Phan-
tom.” As golf coach Underwood was
1 -never seen. He probably wouldn’t
know the Field House from the Cathe-
dral of Learning. He never showed up

*1y' got the job of coaching the team
becausehe worked at Wildwood Coun-
try Club wher_e'.the Panthers formerly
held their matches. It shouldqbe point-
ed out that the word coach is used
- _ _ loosely in referring to Underwood.’
When queried about his team’s chances three days before
the opening match last ‘year, he said, “I don’t know too
much about the boys, you’ll? have to ask Walt Cummins (as-
sistant athletic director).”. ' '

 

SMIZIK _

Underwood’s faults don’t help  determining who the‘-
.golf coach is. Underwood must be eliminated since the team’s
home matches are now, held‘ at Chartiers Country Club.

Can’t Call Field House

The easy thing to do would be to call" up the Field
House and ﬁnd out. But that wouldn’t be much fun. We
checked the spring" -sports schedule because the coach is
always listedvbelow the schedule. There they were: Ben
Pope, tennis; Carl Rees, track; Robert Lewis,-baseball; and
golf, nothing. - g 1

.Maybe Cummins is the coach. He took over in the past
for Underwood. In fact, that probably is the ‘case. And you"
know why no one knows he’s—the coach? Because he’s trying
toikeep it a secret. After all, who would boast about. the‘
fact that they coach’ a team which has won‘ only one’ match-
in three years and is off to an_0-7 record ‘this year.

1 But we wereispeaking ‘of complaining "coaches. There’s
no doubt Pope has a right to complain. No coach should
have to put up with ‘what he does. He has no home -courts,

the trimester system. Face it, the trimester system ‘is not
very attractive to a athlete_who‘plays "a ‘spring sport. He has
to go to school until August so hecan play ball until June.

One point we quarrel with Pope on. He said, as though
it were a disgrace, “Mt. Lebanon high school could knock
us off right now.” I hate to tell Pope, but Mt. Lebanon isn’t
the only school team around here‘ that could beat his boys.

Lewis’ Complaints Silly
Lewis’ complaints don’t register here. He’s ‘moaning
about losing one run games and not getting hits when he
needs them. ‘ .

But Lewis knows that good teams win close games and
get the hits when -they need them. If his team was better
than Syracuse and Cornell they would have won those game.

Lewis also complained about "his team being travel-
weary. Baloney. His team played four games in four days in
the "South, then had three days off before playing Cornell
last Friday and a doubleheader with Syracuse Saturday.
There’s no reason why college athletes can’t stand up under
this kind of a schedule. '

- Rees’ annual complaint is a lack of depth. There is no
doubt that this is correct. He has some excellent individuals,
but has no one to back them up.

Yet the very fact that Rees always complains about a
lack of depth means that it is his own fault. He does the
recruiting and if he feels he lacks depth in certain positions
then he should recruit more wisely.

But the problems of Lewis and Rees are nothing com-

Tim Grgurich, at_.250, has been a surprise to
Lewis, who didn’t expect the right ﬁelder to bat
over .200.

Lewis may rearrange his lineup today be-
cause of the Panthers’ weak hitting. ‘il’m not
quiet sure yet,” he said, “but I may move John
Cullen to left field, and give Barry Wetzel a
little rest. ‘Cullen has looked good in practice,
and could give us the punch we need to win
some games.” 1

Lewis is also. considering starting George
Prussin at second base instead of Steve Eisman.
The coach hopes Prussin will be able to draw

’_  I've come across a fascinating

By BILL CABIN

“Mt. Lebanon high school could knock
us off right now,” said tennis coach Ben
Pope. The two reasons for Pope’s pessi-
mistic view are the team’s lack of ex-

perience and‘ Pitt’-s failure to have its own
courts.

According to Pope, the team, which is cur-
rently 0-2, is “at least twenty-ﬁve per cent
weaker than last year.” The team lost 13 players
from last year’s squad, including captain Dave

. 0’Loughlin and Roger Glaser.

Dick Solyn, Larry O’Loughlin, Adrian Brat-

player is Sam Donatelli, a senior who was in-

years to become a good ‘player. They still try
hard, but many of them are still at the beginning
stage and they just.don’t have the ability.” 0
Although Pope feels that inexperience is a
major problem, he said, “Our biggest handicap is
that we don’t have.our own courts.” The team
is now forced to practice at Mellon, Kinard, and
Arsenal parks, all of which are public parks.

“The failure to have our own courts not only

dulls the interest of the players, but makes it

difficult to recruit. The boys can’t.have -much
pride and there are few spectators to show spirit
at the matches,” said Pope.

“It’s ridiculous. People expect a school the
size oflPitt to have its own tennis courts, and
they’re astonished when they realize we don’t
have any,” Pope added. 0

Pope said that the courts were slated to be

.built three years ago, but the allotment got

switched to another project. Frank Carver, ath-
letic director, has assured Pope that Pitt will
have seven grass courts-available by 1966.

Whether Pitt has courts in 1966 or not, Pope
says “the outlook for 1964 isgloomy.”

Eiseman Expects

Hitting to PickUp

By MARVIN ZELKOWITZ

Steve Eiseman plays second base for the Panther
baseball team. His attitudes, performance, and ideas
reﬂect the fortunes of the team thus far thisseason.

The team is hitting below .200. So is Eiseman.
The team is strong defensively. So is Eiseman. Des-
pite a losing record the teamhas conﬁdence. So does

Although the. bespectacled sophomore second
‘baseman. is hitting below .200 — .125, with two hits
in 16 at bats -- Eiseman is conﬁdent he will break

     

« Reﬂects Team Attitude
“Take Brian‘ (Fisher) for example,” Eiseman con-
tinued. “He’s hitting under’ .200,_too. But he’s meet-
ingvthe "ball. They’re' just not falling in. That?s the
whole team’s.trouble. We’re_ in one collective slump.”
Eiseman doesn’t.expect the team to stay "in its
present 'position.,He even thinks they are going to
start a winning streak. .‘,‘The pitching has been good,”
Eiseman said, “and we have been good in the ﬁeld.

Although Eiseman has had ‘trouble;-with-base hits
so far this-year, it has not a_ﬁect_ed° his ﬁelding. Ac-
cording to his‘ coach, "Bobby Lewis, Ei‘seman'is‘one‘
of the ﬁnest ﬁelderson the team, and"a very reliable

V _Eiseman _agrees_. “I haven’t done too much at
bat,’.’ he said, “but I.haven’t let that affect my»ﬁeld-
ing.lEven, if.I strike out, I can’t'let that get me down
‘in the ﬁeld. Once rm playing the ﬁeld, I have to for-_
get about the mistakes I made at bat.gIf.I don’t, I’-ll
only mess ,up__in the ﬁeld.”. _ i
' Before this year, Eiseman never played second.
base. He played third base in high school, at Pea-
body, and pitched before that. But, despite his ‘inex-
perience, Eiseman had no trouble adjusting to

“I like second base,” he said. “I think I’ve been
playing it pretty well. I’ve' adapted well, and Ithink
I’ve been making all the right moves.”

Eiseman ﬁn'ds himself. secure at second base." “I.
feel good out there‘,-” he said, “And I love that double.

He thinks his conﬁdence in his ability to play-
second base will be a factor in his hitting. “I really
feel relaxed when I play now,” he said. “I think
that will help me calm down at bat.

“Right now,” he said, “I can feel myself starting
to press. Not a lot, but just enough so that I’m afraid
I’m going to start making mistakes.” , ,

Eiseman was a .300 hitter in high school, and he
thinks he can be a .300 hitter in college. His coach
agrees with him, and other team members agree
with him. So-far he has had only two hits. He says
his drought won’t last forever. Only time will tell. '

‘Rees Calls Distance Events Keyto Meet

The Panther track team will
seek their ﬁrst victory of the sea-,
. in a triangular meet with
Syracuse and West Virginia at
Syracuse, Saturday.

Acording to coach Carl Rees .the I
-'l\/lountainers will be the favorites_
because of their strength in the.

distances and the. ﬁeld events.
“Their performances in these
events have been better than ours,
but if we improve in the distances
and get a few places in the ﬁeld
events we have a good chance to
win the meet.” ’

Rees will use Bill Del Vecchio
and "Dick Crout in the 100—yard
dash. These‘ two will also com,-
pete in the 220-yard dash‘ and
Buell will run in the 440-yard
dash. “I hope that DeIVecchio’s
leg wil improve,” said Rees. “He
could mean the difference in the
sprints. _

distance events, though. If our
runners can place or. win, and

Mort Stanﬁeld will compete in

Rees said, “Syracuse and‘ West

players in the shot put, the discus,
and the javelin. Thomasey and
Stanﬁeld will face some strong
competition. =

Friendi Shows Ahility, Consistency

By FRANK SMIZIK
Besides being the best hurdler
and the most versatile man on
the Panther track team, Joe
Friend does something unusual,

"he wins. Friend has been a con-

sistent, winner every year he has

been running for coach Carl Rees’
‘squad. i v

Friend runs both the high and

‘low hurdles and competes in the

broad jump, and ‘after his show-

7-ing in the Penn Relays —— a fourth

in the 120—yardihigh hurdles -

‘‘he has to be considered one of

the top hurdlers in the East.
“The Penn Relays was an un-

usual race for me because the
‘man I ran against was an old.
foe of mine when I raniin high"

school in Lancaster,” said Friend.
“He and I elbowed each other
‘the whole race. It was one of the

_ roughest races I’ve ever run.”

Not usually known for‘ his
elbows as much ,as his legs,
Friend hopes to go through this
year without plague that hits,
trackmen-A--a pulled hamstring.
Last season Joe pulled a mus-_
cle and was out half of the
year and didn’t' run at fullspeed
the whole season." He still did
do well in the broad jump, how-
ever. i A .
“Last year I was jumping off
my left foot and I was getting
better distance than I have this
season oﬂ? my right foot. Myeright
is usually my strongest and I
should be getting more distance.”

The hurdles, however, are an-
other story. Friend reached top
form at the Penn Relays and

hopes to ‘continue _that way“
throughout the season.

This‘ year he should be able
to break the 440—yard hurdles
record, an event which was just

‘started at the stadium last sea-

son. Friendeonly had one chance
to run in that event and was
leading when he slipped and fell.
This year he has had nothing but
the usual minor ailments of a
trackman and should be able to
break.the record.
Friend used to be one of the

runners in the mile relay, but
entering in’ four events would
be too much for anyone. “That
is thefault of the whole track
team,” said Friend. “We don’t

have enough men to run the
events. “When we were‘ running
against Navy they had at least
ﬁfty men on their. squad, whil
we only had ﬁfteen. ‘ “

“I_ don’t agree that we should
schedule easier teams. What we
should have is more of ourprun-O
ners in the meets, such as‘ the
Penn Relays, because we do bet-
ter in that type of competition.
For example Navy beat us badly
in a dual ‘meet, but we scored
more points than them at the
Penn Relays. Except for a couple
bad baton passes we wouldnhave
done better than we did.”

Rothman became, involved
‘in the investigation when a

asked him for advice in de-

for evaluating the newspaper.
He’ suggestedthat the com-
mittee member cooperate in a
survey to review news cover-

editor and business manager
of The News were ‘then con-
ducting. The member would
participate -and obtain the ex-
